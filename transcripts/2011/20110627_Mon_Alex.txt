[00:00:05.232 --> 00:00:05.892]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:07.593]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.314 --> 00:00:09.454]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.075 --> 00:00:10.895]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.655 --> 00:00:12.636]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.196 --> 00:00:16.798]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.399 --> 00:00:21.501]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.502 --> 00:00:37.484]  Well, this is obviously going to be an extremely important and historical broadcast today on a host of fronts and issues.
[00:00:37.544 --> 00:00:43.286]  The Euro is now accelerating its collapse into the next phase of world government by design.
[00:00:43.746 --> 00:00:48.087]  Resistance is mounting at levels the globalists were not ready for.
[00:00:48.847 --> 00:00:50.987]  And they are concerned about that.
[00:00:51.868 --> 00:01:00.489]  We also, of course, have the International Criminal Court calling for the arrest and issuing an arrest warrant for Muammar Gaddafi.
[00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.010]  We also have the spy grid, the federal government expanding headline.
[00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:11.091]  Now Obama sending out snoopers to pose as patients so they can check up on doctors.
[00:01:11.611 --> 00:01:12.691]  New York Times, U.S.
[00:01:12.731 --> 00:01:14.832]  planned stealth survey on access to doctors.
[00:01:15.852 --> 00:01:18.974]  They're moving towards making doctors take Medicare and Medicaid.
[00:01:18.994 --> 00:01:22.395]  Doctors, you know, private practice, can refuse to be involved with the government.
[00:01:22.735 --> 00:01:28.318]  Now they're moving to gather the data to try to make it law and basically nationalize the doctors.
[00:01:28.358 --> 00:01:30.619]  That's where all of that is going today.
[00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.640]  We're going to be breaking that down.
[00:01:33.421 --> 00:01:38.883]  Also, Fukushima residents now showing high levels of radiation in their urine.
[00:01:39.824 --> 00:01:44.366]  We also, listeners were reporting this two weeks ago to us and getting mad that we weren't
[00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:45.606]  Confirming it.
[00:01:45.626 --> 00:01:49.629]  I mean, I could have gotten on an airplane and flown out there, but it looks like what listeners have been saying has been right.
[00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:56.934]  They say it was already flooded weeks ago, but now CNN and others are having to report, and there's some other reports, that it looks like it may be a cover-up.
[00:01:57.994 --> 00:01:59.215]  Some are saying it's melted down.
[00:01:59.275 --> 00:02:00.416]  I don't see any evidence of that.
[00:02:00.936 --> 00:02:03.798]  Berm protecting Fort Calhoun nuclear plant breaks.
[00:02:04.158 --> 00:02:04.979]  Plant flooded.
[00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:07.760]  It's now on emergency diesel generators.
[00:02:08.021 --> 00:02:12.884]  Washington's blog at Infowars.com has a good boil-down of local and national reports.
[00:02:13.784 --> 00:02:21.947]  NRC website defines media blackout over Nebraska nuclear plant flooding.
[00:02:22.027 --> 00:02:26.709]  CNN, backup generators put to use at Nebraska nuclear plant.
[00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:34.872]  We've also got very, very big concern, wildfires near Los Alamos labs that's full of all sorts of nuclear material.
[00:02:36.192 --> 00:02:38.614]  The areas where nukes were tested get lit on fire.
[00:02:39.014 --> 00:02:40.736]  It will put more radiation in the atmosphere.
[00:02:40.756 --> 00:02:43.618]  It's like radioactive hell is being released.
[00:02:43.978 --> 00:02:52.305]  They've got a big reactor obviously leaking months ago in Canada directly into a major lake system and our media is saying it's no big deal.
[00:02:52.705 --> 00:02:55.047]  So we'll be going over that today as well.
[00:02:55.547 --> 00:02:56.328]  Also a very
[00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:58.170]  Good report.
[00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.492]  Boiled down at Infowars.com from the American Dream.
[00:03:01.852 --> 00:03:03.653]  Genetic modification gone wild.
[00:03:03.713 --> 00:03:08.197]  Ten signs that our world may be destined to resemble a really bad science fiction movie.
[00:03:08.737 --> 00:03:10.558]  And I want to go over those ten signs.
[00:03:10.598 --> 00:03:13.280]  Just ten that have been in the news the last few days for you.
[00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.181]  This is ongoing.
[00:03:15.081 --> 00:03:17.643]  Also, Monsanto trying to take over world seed supply.
[00:03:18.004 --> 00:03:18.984]  Nation by nation.
[00:03:19.144 --> 00:03:22.387]  FDA officially declares the sun unsafe, though.
[00:03:22.727 --> 00:03:26.750]  So next you'll have your children CPS'd if any light is allowed to hit them.
[00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:34.674]  Of course, you have to have that for health, and cancer goes off the chart when you don't get the sunlight that then produces the vitamins inside your body you need.
[00:03:35.335 --> 00:03:40.037]  But Cass Sunstein said his regulations are, it's going to be illegal to get sun.
[00:03:40.077 --> 00:03:43.439]  He said, and you should be arrested if you say sun is good for you.
[00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:44.680]  I'm not joking.
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:51.504]  He also said if you're a 9-11 truther or question global warming, you can't make up this level of tyranny.
[00:03:52.384 --> 00:03:53.144]  So that's coming up.
[00:03:53.504 --> 00:04:12.149]  Also the EPA and the courts, the CO2 question, excellent article from Pittsburgh Tribune Review, getting the fact this wasn't a victory that California called for more carbon taxes and the Supreme Court said no, because in the ruling they say only the EPA has the authority and don't worry they're going to start taxing that for you and then they're saying the states have no rights.
[00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:16.751]  So very very dangerous Tenth Amendment attack and of course it attacks other
[00:04:18.251 --> 00:04:24.933]  Facets as well, and more empowers the out-of-control Environmental Protection Agency that is outside of Congress's authority.
[00:04:25.333 --> 00:04:27.774]  Supreme Court says, well, they're authorized under Congress.
[00:04:28.134 --> 00:04:34.476]  Congress didn't pass the new carbon taxes, but the EPA is implementing them by executive fiat.
[00:04:35.056 --> 00:04:36.176]  So that's coming up.
[00:04:36.737 --> 00:04:40.938]  And of course the big news, the big news, we've got joining us from Tripoli,
[00:04:41.798 --> 00:04:42.759]  Webster Griffin Tarpley.
[00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:45.500]  He's been there for days, but phone service has been out for the bombing.
[00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:46.601]  It's a secret mission.
[00:04:46.621 --> 00:04:48.502]  We weren't allowed to talk about it until today.
[00:04:48.542 --> 00:04:50.803]  We'll see if he's able to join us in 30 minutes.
[00:04:50.904 --> 00:04:53.665]  And Wayne Matson, who's been to Tripoli, he's going to be joining us.
[00:04:53.705 --> 00:04:55.526]  He's back from traveling outside the U.S.
[00:04:55.846 --> 00:04:57.988]  Those two guests today, but the big TSA news.
[00:04:58.288 --> 00:04:59.269]  Stay with us, it's coming up.
[00:05:01.653 --> 00:05:03.155]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:05:03.355 --> 00:05:08.381]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:05:08.681 --> 00:05:10.043]  Saving means to make money.
[00:05:10.203 --> 00:05:19.013]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:05:19.734 --> 00:05:26.839]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:34.864]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:05:35.264 --> 00:05:42.668]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you had to do something you've never done before, getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.333]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[00:05:48.633 --> 00:05:50.955]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:05:51.635 --> 00:05:56.540]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[00:06:01.525 --> 00:06:05.149]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:06:05.549 --> 00:06:08.533]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:06:08.793 --> 00:06:13.558]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:06:13.578 --> 00:06:19.825]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:06:19.985 --> 00:06:22.207]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:06:22.748 --> 00:06:23.028]  Tim Geithner?
[00:06:23.048 --> 00:06:23.468]  Bernanke?
[00:06:23.568 --> 00:06:24.169]  They're arsonists!
[00:06:24.209 --> 00:06:24.989]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:27.750]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:06:41.656 --> 00:06:43.477]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:06:43.777 --> 00:06:48.578]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:06:48.918 --> 00:06:58.041]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:07:01.434 --> 00:07:09.937]  The folks at eFoodsDirect have saved you from the huge price increases on food by buying raw materials ahead and packing your supplies themselves.
[00:07:10.437 --> 00:07:14.519]  They haven't increased their prices on great long-term food reserves since last year.
[00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:20.061]  With the rising cost of raw materials and gas prices, they can't hold off any longer.
[00:07:20.741 --> 00:07:28.748]  As of July 1st, Ifoo's Direct is forced to increase their prices so they can still ship you the best storable food on the planet.
[00:07:29.068 --> 00:07:34.532]  Until the end of June, you can lock in the cost of your food at last year's prices by calling 800-409-5633.
[00:07:38.255 --> 00:07:44.658]  Your time is running out to build your supply with the best food on the planet at last year's prices with eFoods Direct.
[00:07:44.938 --> 00:07:45.138]  Call 800-409-5633.
[00:07:45.158 --> 00:07:47.159]  Prices go up at the end of June.

[00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:52.882]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex.
[00:08:05.339 --> 00:08:09.544]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:08:10.164 --> 00:08:10.985]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.746 --> 00:08:12.747]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.288 --> 00:08:16.892]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.492 --> 00:08:21.597]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:28.638 --> 00:08:32.500]  This is going to be an incredibly important broadcast.
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:43.764]  I am begging you out there to think for yourselves, to check the information I'm going to give you, and to really, really open up your mind and hear what I am about to say.
[00:08:44.025 --> 00:08:53.389]  Everything is accelerating more and more on every front, economic, spiritual, military, health-wise.
[00:08:54.585 --> 00:09:02.315]  Everything is coming to a head and then that head will explode and then it will lead to a greater cascade.
[00:09:02.736 --> 00:09:06.120]  The world is going into an just amazing time of flux.
[00:09:06.841 --> 00:09:10.926]  Corruption and those that are attracted to its dark light
[00:09:11.967 --> 00:09:13.489]  Is expanding virally.
[00:09:14.009 --> 00:09:20.836]  Goodness at the same time, throughout history, only is roused and awakened when things get bad.
[00:09:21.417 --> 00:09:28.444]  And the corrupt forces, the social engineers, have written countless white papers on how they've set up the final tyranny, the final revolution.
[00:09:28.745 --> 00:09:31.508]  They've studied how goodness, how wholesomeness,
[00:09:32.048 --> 00:09:32.308]  I don't
[00:09:44.574 --> 00:09:47.997]  Point of total takeover is when good rises.
[00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:21.198]  We're being sold a nihilistic view so we don't tune into our survival instinct that directs us so that we will basically allow ourselves to think it's sexy to lose, sexy to fail, to think it's cool to give in to weakness.
[00:10:21.738 --> 00:10:25.722]  And this can only be sold during a time of incredible decadence.
[00:10:26.263 --> 00:10:44.142]  People who are spoiled rotten from birth, have no connection to reality, are involved in arrested development, they basically are taught that evil and darkness and corruption is powerful and cool, and that somehow it's fun to spiritually align yourself with it.
[00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:54.973]  That is the great crossroads we're at, and that's why they're pumping pure death, pure destruction into us as a type of psychological warfare mechanism.
[00:10:55.194 --> 00:10:57.154]  And I'll talk more about that in the third hour today.
[00:10:57.474 --> 00:11:01.256]  Joining us in T-minus 22 minutes, Webster Griffin Tarpley from Tripoli.
[00:11:01.676 --> 00:11:02.878]  He would have been on Friday.
[00:11:02.898 --> 00:11:03.859]  He would have been on Sunday.
[00:11:03.939 --> 00:11:07.423]  The phones have been out under intense NATO bombing.
[00:11:07.724 --> 00:11:14.913]  Historian and economist Webster Tarpley in Tripoli under bombardment, if he's able to join us, coming up in T-minus 21 minutes.
[00:11:15.434 --> 00:11:20.059]  We weren't supposed to talk about it until he did this first interview, but he's now there in place.
[00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:22.621]  We're going to have him on today coming up.
[00:11:22.881 --> 00:11:27.062]  Wayne Madsen, who's also been to Tripoli, investigative journalist, former with the National Security Agency.
[00:11:27.303 --> 00:11:28.903]  He'll be joining us at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:11:29.263 --> 00:11:36.486]  It'll be open phones and news and key breakdowns of other intelligence after that coming up in the third hour today.
[00:11:36.566 --> 00:11:42.188]  Now, all of that said, let me just read you the stacks here, okay?
[00:11:42.608 --> 00:11:44.489]  Just the first article in each stack.
[00:11:46.937 --> 00:11:47.237]  U.S.
[00:11:47.277 --> 00:11:56.420]  plans stealth survey on access to doctors ahead of nationalizing doctors, forcing you to serve in the National Healthcare Service.
[00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:03.362]  New York Times, Daily Mail, now Obama's sending out snoopers to pose as patients so they can check up on doctors.
[00:12:03.382 --> 00:12:04.483]  This is every industry.
[00:12:05.143 --> 00:12:22.482]  The preachers, the police, anybody, quote, infrastructure protection, they're giving security clearances to the TSA, they're giving it to bridge repair people, and they go on little petty power trips with their secret police, and it's a total takeover, we're going to be going over that.
[00:12:23.704 --> 00:12:33.193]  Obviously, Greece's Deputy Prime Minister warns of tanks in the streets, mass suicides, if second bailout vote downed by Greek Parliament.
[00:12:33.254 --> 00:12:35.656]  Remember what we were told in 2008 in October.
[00:12:36.157 --> 00:12:37.818]  Give the banks tens of trillions
[00:12:38.789 --> 00:12:46.433]  It's an open window of $870 billion that they got over and over again, over $27 trillion, last time we got the numbers, most of it to offshore private families and banks.
[00:12:48.454 --> 00:12:54.196]  Paulson told the closed sessions of House and Senate, you do what we say or there'll be martial law and blood in the streets.
[00:12:54.597 --> 00:12:58.739]  Same things being said, this will be the second bailout for Greece, which is really a payment to the banks.
[00:12:59.699 --> 00:13:03.341]  If they go along with it, their future is totally doomed to third-world-dom.
[00:13:05.814 --> 00:13:10.757]  By the way, they're getting rid of homework now in Southern California, and this is by design because the people are so dumbed down.
[00:13:11.017 --> 00:13:12.078]  It's now a third world country.
[00:13:12.478 --> 00:13:14.039]  People say, well, education's failing.
[00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:19.103]  No, this is in the government documents that Charlotte Isserby, former head of policy, Department of Education, documented.
[00:13:19.463 --> 00:13:24.526]  It is to turn us educationally, chemically, into the servile creatures.
[00:13:24.867 --> 00:13:35.554]  Land of the free, home of the brave, the roughest, toughest, most adventurous, swashbuckling, trailblazing pirates, killers, madmen, sick shooters,
[00:13:36.254 --> 00:13:37.815]  Look what we've turned into, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:37.835 --> 00:13:46.138]  Whether you're black or white or Native American, you all went through adversity and absolute endless war and hardcore Conan the Barbarian activity.
[00:13:46.478 --> 00:13:47.138]  Look at you now.
[00:13:48.138 --> 00:13:49.239]  What happened to us?
[00:13:49.919 --> 00:13:51.599]  Scientific dictatorship happened.
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:55.421]  Rekindle your instincts to be a wild, free human.
[00:13:55.841 --> 00:13:57.021]  Turn on your instincts.
[00:13:57.662 --> 00:13:59.682]  Turn on the life force, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:59.742 --> 00:14:00.823]  It's unstoppable.
[00:14:01.063 --> 00:14:02.303]  And you'll truly be alive.
[00:14:02.763 --> 00:14:04.084]  You can only see what I've seen.
[00:14:05.046 --> 00:14:12.252]  If you could only commit to history, you'd realize why you're so weak, why you feel so powerless, why you behave like jellyfish.
[00:14:12.632 --> 00:14:15.335]  It's because you don't have a fire in your soul.
[00:14:16.556 --> 00:14:25.143]  Only liberty, only the spirit of 1776, the animating spirit of liberty that God can breathe into men and women will quench your thirst.
[00:14:25.563 --> 00:14:25.863]  Sorry.
[00:14:26.584 --> 00:14:26.944]  Sorry.
[00:14:27.064 --> 00:14:27.565]  I'm sorry.
[00:14:27.825 --> 00:14:28.425]  Let me continue.
[00:14:28.466 --> 00:14:29.847]  It's all coming down, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:32.102 --> 00:14:43.345]  Meanwhile, they're threatening the same thing here in the United States, saying we'll lose our debt rating if we don't give the bankers even more money.
[00:14:43.906 --> 00:14:46.626]  Threat of $100 billion hit if U.S.
[00:14:47.927 --> 00:14:49.887]  top rating loss, Financial Times of London.
[00:14:50.268 --> 00:14:51.548]  It's all happening right now.
[00:14:51.568 --> 00:14:52.508]  We're going to break this down.
[00:14:54.349 --> 00:14:57.810]  As the economic dictatorship, the banker occupation rolls on,
[00:14:59.363 --> 00:15:03.425]  We've got incredible nuclear reactor news from the United States.
[00:15:03.465 --> 00:15:06.227]  Turns out that the facility has been flooded.
[00:15:06.747 --> 00:15:07.648]  The power is off.
[00:15:07.668 --> 00:15:10.809]  They're on diesel generators at Fort Calhoun.
[00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:14.111]  Our listeners said this was happening weeks ago from people they knew in the plant.
[00:15:14.311 --> 00:15:15.952]  We were flooded with calls, but I couldn't confirm it.
[00:15:16.192 --> 00:15:19.694]  I guess they're going to get on an airplane, but those facilities have got guys with guns guarding them.
[00:15:19.914 --> 00:15:20.755]  How am I going to find out?
[00:15:21.515 --> 00:15:24.577]  Again, under national security, they hide what's really going on here.
[00:15:24.617 --> 00:15:25.998]  Los Alamos is on fire.
[00:15:26.898 --> 00:15:27.859]  Very, very big concern.
[00:15:27.879 --> 00:15:29.560]  Wildfire nears Los Alamos lab.
[00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:31.582]  It's already on the nuclear testing areas.
[00:15:32.042 --> 00:15:34.704]  So it's reigniting all that stuff and getting into the atmosphere.
[00:15:34.724 --> 00:15:36.385]  That's MSNBC.
[00:15:36.485 --> 00:15:38.106]  It is all coming up.
[00:15:38.266 --> 00:15:54.378]  But first, before I get into the incredible treachery, the off-the-charts betrayal, duplicity that I have never even seen from Bill Clinton or Al Gore, who are masters of duplicity and deception, of slickness, of sliminess,
[00:15:55.700 --> 00:16:07.650]  Rick Perry and the Speaker of the Texas House and the Leader of the Senate, Dewhurst, they make Clinton and Obama and Bush look like pikers.
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:11.161]  Look like addled idiots.
[00:16:12.021 --> 00:16:19.142]  Okay, this information, and yes, we're going to have a citizen filibuster today, tomorrow, and Wednesday.
[00:16:19.563 --> 00:16:22.003]  We're going to make sure, we're going to go talk to our representatives.
[00:16:22.023 --> 00:16:24.004]  I'm going to tell you what a citizen filibuster is.
[00:16:24.044 --> 00:16:25.584]  I'm inventing it today.
[00:16:27.004 --> 00:16:30.185]  I invented it this morning out of anger at 7 a.m.
[00:16:30.205 --> 00:16:32.646]  talking to Paul Watson and reading over the legislation.
[00:16:32.666 --> 00:16:33.986]  I'm going to break it all down for you.
[00:16:34.738 --> 00:16:36.899]  But starting at four o'clock today at that Capitol.
[00:16:36.919 --> 00:16:37.700]  In fact, start now.
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:38.861]  Get over there now.
[00:16:38.881 --> 00:16:40.522]  I'm gonna explain what a citizen filibuster is.
[00:16:40.542 --> 00:16:42.683]  I'm inventing it here.
[00:16:44.024 --> 00:16:45.385]  Only you can breathe life into it.
[00:16:45.465 --> 00:16:46.486]  Only you can animate it.
[00:16:47.318 --> 00:16:48.158]  Will you animate it?
[00:16:48.538 --> 00:16:49.879]  Will you step forward into history?
[00:16:50.199 --> 00:16:59.422]  Before I do that, I want to play a clip from Bugs Life we played from time to time about why the feds are so upset, why they're twisting arms, and why they've engaged in extremely dirty tricks to get this.
[00:16:59.822 --> 00:17:04.124]  Because if Texas stands up and people, the feds can only have victory after victory.
[00:17:04.964 --> 00:17:16.491]  If they ever have a defeat at the state level, it's starting to happen all over the country in different ways, the idea that we can use the Constitution to overthrow their tyranny will get purchased.
[00:17:16.571 --> 00:17:19.552]  It will get a foothold and their time is over.
[00:17:22.354 --> 00:17:27.957]  So this is very exciting that we pushed them into a second session and that we're going to push them into a third.
[00:17:28.197 --> 00:17:28.818]  First pray
[00:17:30.185 --> 00:17:34.628]  There's a regular session, second session, and then a second special session, a third session.
[00:17:35.188 --> 00:17:36.048]  It ends Wednesday.
[00:17:36.068 --> 00:17:48.416]  We need to get in there, tell the state reps, tell the senators, look, just don't show up for votes, talk to others, kill all the legislation, and explain to them, you're not going to get all your other garbage through until you do this.
[00:17:48.436 --> 00:17:51.417]  And I'll explain Perry's duplicity in a moment and what's happened.
[00:17:51.757 --> 00:17:52.478]  They've killed the bill.
[00:17:53.298 --> 00:17:54.339]  This is, they killed it on Friday.
[00:17:54.359 --> 00:17:56.480]  They've officially put nails in it today.
[00:17:57.441 --> 00:17:57.681]  Okay.
[00:17:59.244 --> 00:18:02.665]  And I'm going down there at 4 o'clock today, but you can start going now, and I'm gonna break it all down.
[00:18:02.685 --> 00:18:04.766]  But first, here's A Bug's Life as we go out to break.
[00:18:04.786 --> 00:18:07.907]  There was that ant that stood up to me.
[00:18:08.247 --> 00:18:10.288]  Yeah, but we can forget about him.
[00:18:10.328 --> 00:18:12.329]  Yeah, it was just one ant.
[00:18:12.449 --> 00:18:13.409]  One ant.
[00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:16.070]  Yeah, you're right.
[00:18:16.451 --> 00:18:18.791]  It's just one ant.
[00:18:18.872 --> 00:18:19.712]  Yeah, boss.
[00:18:19.752 --> 00:18:20.952]  They're puny.
[00:18:21.272 --> 00:18:22.453]  Hmm, puny.
[00:18:23.253 --> 00:18:27.555]  Say, let's pretend this brain is a puny little ant.
[00:18:28.888 --> 00:18:29.408]  Did that hurt?
[00:18:30.409 --> 00:18:30.649]  Nope.
[00:18:31.129 --> 00:18:32.410]  Well, how about this one?
[00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:33.991]  Are you kidding?
[00:18:34.011 --> 00:18:37.152]  Well, how about this?
[00:18:45.096 --> 00:18:45.897]  Dub's a giant.
[00:18:46.815 --> 00:18:48.016]  Container of grain on them.
[00:18:48.036 --> 00:18:49.697]  Instead of one, it's hundreds.
[00:18:50.237 --> 00:18:55.601]  You let one ant stand up to us, then they all might stand up.
[00:18:56.341 --> 00:19:00.804]  Those puny little ants outnumber us a hundred to one.
[00:19:01.324 --> 00:19:05.367]  And if they ever figure that out, there goes our way of life!
[00:19:06.187 --> 00:19:07.468]  It's not about food.
[00:19:08.189 --> 00:19:10.910]  It's about keeping those ants in line.
[00:19:11.671 --> 00:19:13.192]  That's why we're going back!
[00:19:14.673 --> 00:19:16.455]  Does anybody else want to stay?
[00:19:19.637 --> 00:19:23.080]  And they all turn their wings on and fly out to go oppress the ants.
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:26.223]  Now, we're at the crossroads.
[00:19:27.564 --> 00:19:41.836]  If they can make 95-year-old women going home to die with their family take a diaper off and stand for 45 minutes while they strip search them, if they can grow up little girls, and if they can microwave you in the porno scanners,
[00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:44.771]  The largest part of gaining radiant health is detoxification.
[00:19:44.891 --> 00:19:52.273]  You can drink ionized water, cleanse your intestines, eat a perfect diet, and even take lots of quality supplements and in many instances only make minimal progress.
[00:20:12.099 --> 00:20:16.122]  What is the key to detoxifying your body of mercury, heavy metals, chemicals, and drugs?
[00:20:16.643 --> 00:20:17.684]  It is glutathione.
[00:20:18.084 --> 00:20:21.747]  Glutathione is the master antioxidant used to detoxify your entire body.
[00:20:22.167 --> 00:20:25.590]  It stops free radicals, keeps cells young, and reduces inflammation.
[00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:30.434]  One World Way protein powder may be able to raise your glutathione production by 64% or more.
[00:20:31.935 --> 00:20:38.661]  One World Whey is more effective than any other whey protein powder on the market because it is unheated and from grass-fed cows.
[00:20:39.181 --> 00:20:45.106]  All other, quote, cold-processed whey protein powders have been heated and damaged by 15% or more.
[00:20:45.607 --> 00:20:47.688]  One World Whey comes in three delicious flavors.
[00:20:48.009 --> 00:20:48.409]  Call 888-988-3325.
[00:20:48.449 --> 00:20:48.629]  That's 888-988-3325.

[00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:38.996]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:21:39.056 --> 00:21:39.797]  This capitalism?
[00:21:39.857 --> 00:21:46.001]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:21:46.121 --> 00:21:46.942]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:21:46.982 --> 00:21:50.084]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.

[00:23:57.925 --> 00:24:17.071]  Okay, what's happened is, with the states' rights battle, the Fourth Amendment battle, the dignity battle, where strangers with no due process
[00:24:18.907 --> 00:24:19.908]  No proof of a crime.
[00:24:20.609 --> 00:24:23.271]  Grab your genitals and actually squeeze them to find out what they are.
[00:24:23.591 --> 00:24:30.897]  This has happened to Miss USA, it's happened to state reps in Texas, it's happened to Ron Paul, Jesse Ventura, the list goes on and on.
[00:24:31.798 --> 00:24:33.119]  I've watched it happen to children.
[00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:37.603]  The naked body scanners, the lies about radiation, all of it.
[00:24:38.123 --> 00:24:39.665]  This is about a federal power grab.
[00:24:39.685 --> 00:24:42.087]  And what's happened is a long train of deception.
[00:24:42.127 --> 00:24:43.308]  Rick Perry said he supported it.
[00:24:44.518 --> 00:24:52.766]  Uh, then when they passed unanimously in the House and they had a near unanimous one vote against in the Senate, David Dewhurst went in there and killed it and they didn't let it come to the floor.
[00:24:53.126 --> 00:24:57.791]  And it came out that he'd done that and Senator Patrick and others, who are very prominent, came out and said they witnessed it.
[00:24:58.692 --> 00:25:00.294]  Then they did what Perry always does.
[00:25:00.514 --> 00:25:02.276]  Act like you're for something, but then kill it.
[00:25:02.956 --> 00:25:04.998]  Remember, this is Al Gore's former Chief of Staff.
[00:25:05.018 --> 00:25:10.163]  This is a guy that tried to force girls to take forced inoculations of a deadly vaccine they knew was killing people in the trials.
[00:25:10.524 --> 00:25:19.713]  This is the guy that got awarded in 2005 from Vicente Fox for setting up sanctuary cities and giving free in-state tuition to illegals.
[00:25:20.113 --> 00:25:20.613]  Look it up!
[00:25:21.374 --> 00:25:23.396]  We've written articles with links to mainstream news.
[00:25:24.116 --> 00:25:28.719]  This guy is like Bill Clinton on steroids, but he talks about being conservative.
[00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:31.421]  And so they killed it.
[00:25:31.862 --> 00:25:34.804]  Then Perry wouldn't put it on the legislative session, the special session.
[00:25:35.144 --> 00:25:36.845]  He waited until a couple weeks of it was over.
[00:25:37.245 --> 00:25:41.048]  Then he lied on record and said, well, it's too late to put it on when he can put it on.
[00:25:41.068 --> 00:25:42.089]  He's the only one that can do it.
[00:25:42.649 --> 00:25:43.770]  And then he said, there's not enough time.
[00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:45.211]  And they said, well, you're the one that can put it on.
[00:25:45.772 --> 00:25:47.293]  You can call for another session if you want.
[00:25:47.992 --> 00:25:50.494]  And so he did, last Monday.
[00:25:50.514 --> 00:25:52.136]  Then they said, wait till Friday, we'll vote on it.
[00:25:52.496 --> 00:25:53.657]  Then the Senate didn't show up.
[00:25:54.337 --> 00:26:00.663]  The Speaker of the House, who'd voted for the bill, when it was voted for unanimously, came out and said, it's a stunt, it does nothing.
[00:26:01.483 --> 00:26:03.845]  When the Attorney General had even been involved writing it.
[00:26:04.125 --> 00:26:13.974]  And it clearly said, it's official oppression for a police officer, state police, it's already on the books, anybody, to come up and grab your genitals without a warrant or due process.
[00:26:14.909 --> 00:26:19.952]  You know, if a cop sees you shove a gun in your pants and think you're about to do something, then they could tackle you and try to get it out of your pants.
[00:26:20.232 --> 00:26:21.973]  But you don't just line people up and do this.
[00:26:22.053 --> 00:26:24.194]  It's the end of innocent until proven guilty.
[00:26:25.594 --> 00:26:26.815]  And so all of that happened.
[00:26:27.275 --> 00:26:28.696]  And the whole country's watching this.
[00:26:28.896 --> 00:26:33.118]  And so now, suddenly, first they kill at the Senate for politics.
[00:26:33.578 --> 00:26:37.400]  Then they pass... Okay, now it's your turn to take a political hit, they tell the Speaker of the House.
[00:26:37.781 --> 00:26:39.181]  He comes out and says it's dead.
[00:26:41.533 --> 00:26:44.254]  This is one of the chief authors of the bill.
[00:26:44.294 --> 00:26:47.734]  This is Representative David Simpson.
[00:26:47.754 --> 00:26:48.815]  We've interviewed many times.
[00:26:49.235 --> 00:26:51.095]  This is TSA Tyranny, their website.
[00:26:51.455 --> 00:26:52.915]  Not all the disinfo, okay?
[00:26:53.376 --> 00:26:58.777]  TSA Tyranny withdraws support from House version of TSA anti-groping bill, HB 41.
[00:26:58.817 --> 00:27:00.097]  They blocked it last week.
[00:27:00.697 --> 00:27:04.238]  Now they've gutted it as basically just a resolution.
[00:27:04.778 --> 00:27:06.599]  With no teeth where it won't do anything.
[00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:10.942]  Now, we've got today to try to get them to re-scramble it and bring back the old bill.
[00:27:10.982 --> 00:27:19.268]  But the point is, we don't need to have little permitted demonstrations out front that are ignored with cops bugging their eyes out at us.
[00:27:20.109 --> 00:27:27.614]  We need to go in and talk to our representatives, our servants, with what I'm dubbing a citizen filibuster.
[00:27:27.814 --> 00:27:28.775]  And I'm inventing this.
[00:27:30.168 --> 00:27:46.854]  Now, what you do is, you go in, legally and lawfully, go in any entrance you want, four o'clock today, I say start getting there now, and you go in to the Speaker of the House, the Governor's office, you go into the Lieutenant Governor's office, the culprits, and you let them know that you're upset with what's happening, but more importantly, you then go...
[00:27:47.674 --> 00:28:02.161]  And tell your servants, in a focused, serious, but polite way, looking them in the eye, you then go to your House members, you then go to Senate members, and you go in and you say, I am going, I want on record where you are, don't try to duck this.
[00:28:03.862 --> 00:28:12.246]  You need to say that you're not going to show up for votes and you're going to get others to stand down like they did last Friday to kill the bill.
[00:28:13.827 --> 00:28:16.008]  They tentatively killed it then, pretty much officially today.
[00:28:17.216 --> 00:28:19.137]  Or did David Simpson and others, and I agree with their analysis.
[00:28:20.017 --> 00:28:23.578]  So there's a lot of people that just want to get a fake resolution to declare victory.
[00:28:23.838 --> 00:28:25.978]  We're not here to be given fake things.
[00:28:26.059 --> 00:28:27.339]  We want the real deal.
[00:28:27.639 --> 00:28:30.880]  And we want the federal state constitutional challenge.
[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:32.800]  We want the constitutional crisis.
[00:28:33.301 --> 00:28:41.263]  Just like we want the House and Senate to stand up to Obama for not even getting authorization from them for the war, and saying he doesn't need authorization because he has the UN.
[00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:48.936]  Big things are happening right now, and history is unfolding right now.
[00:28:49.897 --> 00:28:55.022]  And I need everybody all over Texas to get in your cars now.
[00:28:55.443 --> 00:28:56.043]  I'll be there at 4.
[00:28:57.352 --> 00:29:02.856]  And I'll come in there at the South entrance, you know, the one where Congress comes right up.
[00:29:03.156 --> 00:29:15.945]  Four o'clock, bright-eyed, bushy-tailed, I'm going to be there and I'm going into that Capitol and I'm going to go into the different House and Senate offices and I'm going to bring my citizen filibuster to them and say, look,
[00:29:16.525 --> 00:29:18.146]  Hold up all the other legislation.
[00:29:18.186 --> 00:29:19.747]  That's what House and Senate members should do.
[00:29:20.107 --> 00:29:23.769]  Those of you that have filibuster power, go in and filibuster the entire session.
[00:29:23.809 --> 00:29:26.570]  That's what you're supposed to do in a crisis like this.
[00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:35.614]  And so we can block all the other bills they're trying to pass, most of them, you know, globalist power grabs, to force a whole nother special session.
[00:29:36.054 --> 00:29:40.497]  To force Perry out in the open again to put it back on that legislative session.
[00:29:40.737 --> 00:29:42.938]  To continue keeping this issue front and center.
[00:29:43.698 --> 00:29:46.339]  Who wins the fight against tyranny is who wants it most.
[00:29:46.999 --> 00:29:50.000]  You gotta continue and go and go 12 rounds.
[00:29:50.901 --> 00:29:51.781]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.281 --> 00:29:53.882]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.802 --> 00:29:57.483]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.584 --> 00:30:03.066]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:03.286 --> 00:30:08.312]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:30:08.592 --> 00:30:09.974]  Saving means to make money.
[00:30:10.134 --> 00:30:18.924]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:30:19.645 --> 00:30:26.750]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:34.795]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:30:35.195 --> 00:30:42.580]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you've had to do something you've never done before, getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:30:45.362 --> 00:30:48.286]  Or see Calvin on the web at 5starsub.com.
[00:30:48.566 --> 00:30:50.889]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:30:50.949 --> 00:30:53.072]  Or see Calvin on the web at 5starsub.com.
[00:31:01.069 --> 00:31:15.541]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:31:16.542 --> 00:31:20.225]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:31:21.229 --> 00:31:33.239]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:41.265]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:31:41.946 --> 00:31:51.554]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:31:52.315 --> 00:31:55.597]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:31:56.238 --> 00:31:59.361]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[00:31:59.901 --> 00:32:04.142]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:32:04.462 --> 00:32:05.063]  Number one.
[00:32:05.363 --> 00:32:08.524]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:32:08.784 --> 00:32:09.364]  Number two.
[00:32:09.644 --> 00:32:14.206]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:32:14.546 --> 00:32:14.986]  It's true.
[00:32:15.286 --> 00:32:19.847]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:20.147 --> 00:32:20.708]  Number three.
[00:32:20.988 --> 00:32:24.269]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:32:24.569 --> 00:32:28.270]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:29.031]  Number 4.
[00:32:29.271 --> 00:32:31.633]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:32:32.033 --> 00:32:35.417]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:35.717 --> 00:32:35.917]  Number 5.
[00:32:36.498 --> 00:32:40.421]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:32:40.641 --> 00:32:45.406]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:32:45.686 --> 00:32:49.710]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:51.432]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:51.652 --> 00:32:53.734]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:32:53.914 --> 00:32:56.257]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:33:17.967 --> 00:33:29.237]  Yeah, I want to say, Donker Shane, I love you, I appreciate you, all the listeners out there for the incredible job that you've been doing spreading the word about liberty and freedom, the actions you've been taking.
[00:33:29.878 --> 00:33:36.563]  None of us are going to save the world by ourselves, but incrementally, by reaching out to others,
[00:33:37.737 --> 00:33:45.583]  Incrementally, by continuing to resist corruption, you basically expose it.
[00:33:45.603 --> 00:33:48.144]  You basically are able to then call it out.
[00:33:48.164 --> 00:33:55.950]  We're going to be talking to Webster Griffin Tarpley, a doctor of history and also an economist who bravely traveled to Tripoli.
[00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:59.172]  We knew about this last week, but weren't able to announce it until now.
[00:33:59.553 --> 00:34:03.776]  He would have been on Sunday, but the bombardments have knocked out the telephones.
[00:34:04.636 --> 00:34:06.778]  Now we have the International Criminal Court.
[00:34:07.398 --> 00:34:07.698]  I don't know.
[00:34:21.704 --> 00:34:27.389]  They are calling for his arrest now, and there's a bunch of generals over the weekend testifying to Congress.
[00:34:27.449 --> 00:34:32.374]  It's now come out in closed session that they do want ground invasion, as we told you a few weeks ago.
[00:34:32.474 --> 00:34:33.675]  So that is coming up.
[00:34:35.217 --> 00:34:45.506]  Now, continuing here, Texans to launch... Texans to launch citizen filibuster over TSA groping.
[00:34:46.704 --> 00:34:50.805]  Campaign seeks to pressure public servants into following will of the people.
[00:34:50.845 --> 00:34:53.406]  This just went live at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:34:53.426 --> 00:34:55.146]  Please get this article out to everyone you know.
[00:34:55.546 --> 00:34:56.467]  Twitter everyone.
[00:34:56.607 --> 00:34:57.267]  Call friends.
[00:34:57.327 --> 00:34:58.347]  Call the local radio.
[00:34:58.687 --> 00:34:59.407]  Tell everybody.
[00:34:59.647 --> 00:35:05.189]  Citizens are going to be in the Capitol today, tomorrow, and Wednesday in the last days of the special session.
[00:35:05.769 --> 00:35:09.110]  And the tactic is go in and ask your state reps to filibuster
[00:35:10.558 --> 00:35:21.273]  And to block all the other legislation so they're forced to either do the right thing, we've already had a unanimous vote in the House, and ban the TSA engaging in criminal activity, or just enforce the existing law.
[00:35:23.081 --> 00:35:50.876]  And at the same time, get those state reps and Senate members to let the Lieutenant Governor, the Speaker of the House, and the Governor know that if they don't follow the will of the people, the law, and the unanimous House and the near-unanimous Senate, if they continue to violate House and Senate rules and have the leadership kill the bill, they've now got a watered-down version, and David Simpson is saying he's withdrawn his support.
[00:35:52.557 --> 00:35:52.737]  I think?
[00:36:13.005 --> 00:36:20.831]  Uh, and enforce the law, or we're gonna force this thing into another special session, and that's the last thing Rick Perry wants right now.
[00:36:21.412 --> 00:36:27.597]  Rick Perry does not want that because he has to wait till the session's over, because he's pledged to do it, before he announces to run for president.
[00:36:28.157 --> 00:36:30.259]  So believe me, this has got him really, really concerned.
[00:36:30.319 --> 00:36:31.500]  I'm going down there at 4 o'clock.
[00:36:32.369 --> 00:36:34.270]  I don't particularly want to go down there, but it's my duty.
[00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:36.011]  I'm going to be down there for a few hours.
[00:36:36.471 --> 00:36:39.092]  You can show up at 4, 6, 10, whenever you can.
[00:36:39.272 --> 00:36:40.873]  They'll be going to midnight the next few days.
[00:36:41.213 --> 00:36:42.294]  Get there early in the morning.
[00:36:42.774 --> 00:36:44.295]  Get there in the afternoon tomorrow.
[00:36:44.515 --> 00:36:47.316]  But the big time to show up is today at 4 o'clock.
[00:36:47.896 --> 00:36:54.639]  So the next three days, we need citizens of Texas and people that love freedom to be crawling all over that Capitol.
[00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:55.540]  It's our house.
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:57.341]  And if we don't use it, we'll lose it.
[00:36:58.109 --> 00:36:59.410]  So more coming up in the next hour.
[00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:02.752]  Texans to launch citizen filibuster over TSA groping.
[00:37:02.792 --> 00:37:06.855]  I explain what this tactic is at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:37:07.295 --> 00:37:14.400]  Other big article, new document proves TSA mischaracterized safety aspects of full body scanners.
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:18.063]  Big breaking news at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:37:19.048 --> 00:37:31.616]  But again, TSA tyranny, David Simpson's site, withdraw support for House version of TSA anti-groping bill, HB 41, that's coming up for a vote in the next few hours because it is a gutted whitewash and they break it down.
[00:37:31.917 --> 00:37:35.319]  That's also at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:37:35.959 --> 00:37:39.281]  Now, going to Tripoli, Webster Griffin Tarpley,
[00:37:40.262 --> 00:37:47.145]  He is our guest, the author of the unauthorized biography of George Herbert Walker Bush and Barack Obama, a doctor of history and an economist.
[00:37:47.965 --> 00:37:53.467]  Tarpley, you let us know the day before you were leaving last week, but that we couldn't talk about it until you got into the country.
[00:37:53.487 --> 00:37:54.287]  We understand why.
[00:37:54.668 --> 00:37:56.108]  You've got a lot of courage, my friend.
[00:37:56.128 --> 00:37:56.888]  You're well-traveled.
[00:37:57.189 --> 00:37:57.989]  Why are you there?
[00:37:58.109 --> 00:38:05.612]  What are you witnessing in Tripoli as the globalists admit, the top general admits to Congress, they're preparing for ground war?
[00:38:07.062 --> 00:38:09.864]  Well, I'm sort of on a fact-finding mission, Alex.
[00:38:09.924 --> 00:38:11.025]  Thank you for having me on.
[00:38:11.505 --> 00:38:16.489]  The idea here is to come here and see what is actually happening.
[00:38:16.889 --> 00:38:19.371]  And there have been a number of people coming through here.
[00:38:19.411 --> 00:38:29.998]  You've probably seen Cynthia McKinney, might have seen Wayne Madsen, a number of academics from the United States, people from other parts of the world have been invited.
[00:38:30.098 --> 00:38:33.881]  So there's a kind of a modest flow of people.
[00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:39.063]  Uh, coming in to do essentially a fact-finding mission.
[00:38:39.744 --> 00:38:43.266]  And I think these are things that people ought to be aware of.
[00:38:43.346 --> 00:38:49.631]  This is a very, very extreme case of imperialism, what you might call the New World Order.
[00:38:49.691 --> 00:38:52.613]  This is in many ways the leading edge of it.
[00:38:53.268 --> 00:38:57.711]  And I would just like to share some impressions, first of all, of what happens when you get here.
[00:38:57.751 --> 00:39:02.033]  You can't come in the normal way through an airplane or even through a boat.
[00:39:02.073 --> 00:39:03.494]  You could come from Italy by boat.
[00:39:03.975 --> 00:39:05.856]  But they won't let you do that.
[00:39:05.896 --> 00:39:09.758]  They have a no-fly zone, so there's no commercial aircraft traffic.
[00:39:09.858 --> 00:39:16.202]  And even the Libyan fishing boats along the Mediterranean coast are now being shot at
[00:39:16.762 --> 00:39:24.764]  By predator drones of the United States as they go out and try to provide some fish for people's dinner tables.
[00:39:24.784 --> 00:39:30.246]  The food here is excellent, but it's very heavily based on fish.
[00:39:30.286 --> 00:39:32.466]  So what happens is you drive in, essentially.
[00:39:32.486 --> 00:39:43.329]  You drive across the Tunisian border, usually, and the first thing you see is there are these checkpoints every 5 to 10 kilometers.
[00:39:43.389 --> 00:39:44.930]  I think probably we went by
[00:39:45.689 --> 00:39:49.252]  Maybe 40 or maybe even 50 of these checkpoints.
[00:39:49.352 --> 00:39:55.337]  And you're driving through the North African desert, right through the Libyan Maghreb desert in the night.
[00:39:55.537 --> 00:40:01.481]  The roads are filled with heavy trucks, because there is commerce going on.
[00:40:01.501 --> 00:40:05.364]  These sanctions are not as watertight as people think.
[00:40:05.925 --> 00:40:09.868]  And you come to these checkpoints, and this is partly the Libyan army.
[00:40:10.586 --> 00:40:19.489]  But they're also supplemented by volunteers, and many of them are women volunteers, and quite a lot of them are black women volunteers.
[00:40:19.849 --> 00:40:29.693]  And what you can see is, Gaddafi has a very serious base of support, or maybe it's more accurate to say, the Libyan government.
[00:40:29.893 --> 00:40:35.074]  He's now handed out two million machine guns, grenade launchers, hand grenades, and when the U.S.
[00:40:35.395 --> 00:40:39.276]  NATO force rolls in there in October, it is going to be an absolute bloodbath.
[00:40:40.465 --> 00:40:42.146]  I think that's very important, Alex.
[00:40:42.226 --> 00:40:44.726]  This is something that they've told us about.
[00:40:44.986 --> 00:40:55.049]  They've essentially given one to two million Kalashnikovs, Storm, these assault rifles, as you mentioned, and that's people's war.
[00:40:55.229 --> 00:40:59.010]  And if you really are a dictator, this is something you cannot do.
[00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:02.291]  If Gaddafi had been in reality what the U.S.
[00:41:02.331 --> 00:41:08.693]  propaganda says he is, why, as soon as everybody got those Kalashnikovs, that would have been the end of the current government.
[00:41:09.453 --> 00:41:14.314]  Well, Webster, they now admit, Amnesty admits, the State Department, no rape gangs with Viagra.
[00:41:14.594 --> 00:41:16.555]  They admit the baby incubator story was fake.
[00:41:16.595 --> 00:41:17.815]  It's the same group doing that.
[00:41:18.555 --> 00:41:21.296]  They admit he didn't run to Venezuela all those times.
[00:41:21.336 --> 00:41:22.356]  That was destabilized.
[00:41:22.716 --> 00:41:26.717]  And they now admit, the top admirals come out and admit it, yes, we're trying to kill Gaddafi.
[00:41:26.957 --> 00:41:32.658]  Well, obviously, when they're blowing up all of his houses and government buildings every time he's in them, obviously they're trying to do that.
[00:41:32.738 --> 00:41:34.198]  They tell us it's not a war.
[00:41:34.718 --> 00:41:35.399]  It is a war.
[00:41:37.159 --> 00:41:38.380]  I meant to get the reports yesterday.
[00:41:38.441 --> 00:41:39.021]  I mentioned it.
[00:41:39.362 --> 00:41:45.369]  But even Reuters and AP are admitting that Congress has been told, yes, the ground forces are ready and are going to be needed.
[00:41:45.729 --> 00:41:48.553]  The troops have told us this for late September, early October.
[00:41:49.294 --> 00:41:50.796]  This is absolutely insane.
[00:41:51.276 --> 00:41:54.000]  But please continue, from Libya, telling us what you're seeing.
[00:41:55.302 --> 00:42:01.605]  Well, in terms of this people's war, I would warn everybody that the U.S.
[00:42:01.765 --> 00:42:07.527]  or NATO or anybody's invasion of Libya is going to be an act of incalculable folly.
[00:42:08.688 --> 00:42:11.109]  It is simply a gratuitous bloodbath.
[00:42:11.249 --> 00:42:14.130]  It's going to make Black Hawk Down look like a picnic.
[00:42:14.770 --> 00:42:15.250]  A picnic.
[00:42:15.330 --> 00:42:20.733]  And even with all of the bombing that has gone on so far, what I'm amazed at is the
[00:42:22.022 --> 00:42:22.522]  I think so.
[00:42:40.638 --> 00:42:42.219]  An invasion is going to be very different.
[00:42:42.859 --> 00:42:53.644]  I was talking to an ambassador, a distinguished, older man, extremely cultured, perfect American, perfect French, you know, knows the ways of the world.
[00:42:54.084 --> 00:43:07.111]  And he said, well, if the invasion comes, he said, we in my household with my wife and my kids, an extended family, we did a kind of census, right, what we could do militarily.
[00:43:07.151 --> 00:43:07.891]  And he said, well,
[00:43:08.431 --> 00:43:22.957]  We figured we had enough RPGs to knock out about four tanks, and enough ammunition and Kalashnikovs to take care of, I don't know what, a couple of platoons, and that's just one family.
[00:43:23.077 --> 00:43:32.600]  And remember, the Libyan population is six million, and it breaks down to about one million are under this rebel council, under this gang of terrorists.
[00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:35.001]  They're under the al-Qaeda command.
[00:43:35.321 --> 00:43:36.262]  That's what it is.
[00:43:37.342 --> 00:43:48.706]  These, the rest of the five, the other five million are loyal to the government and to the institutions that have been really successful here in raising the standard of living from one of the lowest, right?
[00:43:48.806 --> 00:43:49.946]  Rock bottom in Africa.
[00:43:49.966 --> 00:43:56.528]  But notice, Al-Qaeda used against the Russians, Al-Qaeda used against the Serbs, Al-Qaeda used against the Iranian Shiites.
[00:43:57.209 --> 00:44:00.590]  Now they're putting in Al-Qaeda-backed Muslim Brotherhood people in Egypt.
[00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:02.170]  I mean, don't folks get it?
[00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:04.151]  And we're all a locky, hanging out at the Pentagon.
[00:44:04.431 --> 00:44:05.172]  Right, it certainly is.
[00:44:05.192 --> 00:44:08.456]  But in terms of what happens with Libya, the other thing about it is
[00:44:18.190 --> 00:44:24.576]  It is a tribal society, and as people talk about it, they say everyone is a member of one or the other of the tribes.
[00:44:24.997 --> 00:44:41.193]  Now what that means, though, is that even if the government is decapitated or these other things they're trying to do, that will not solve the problem for NATO, because there is a ready-made combat organization which is available in the form of the tribes.
[00:44:41.753 --> 00:44:47.937]  And there is no way around this, no matter what you do, as long as anybody lives here at all.
[00:44:48.098 --> 00:44:49.839]  And you can't buy them all off.
[00:44:50.159 --> 00:44:51.440]  And you can't buy them all off.
[00:44:52.641 --> 00:44:55.423]  No, you can't, because there's a very strong sense of nationalism.
[00:44:55.443 --> 00:44:58.184]  There's a devotion to having a united country.
[00:44:58.245 --> 00:45:05.570]  So I would simply urge people, if you look at that vote in the House of Representatives last week, it was 238 to 180.
[00:45:08.292 --> 00:45:10.594]  Uh, concerning cutting off the money.
[00:45:11.015 --> 00:45:12.777]  And it means that it lost.
[00:45:12.797 --> 00:45:18.283]  238 voted for war, 180 voted for no money and no war.
[00:45:18.303 --> 00:45:26.232]  Now that simply means, if you could shift 30 votes from the war column into the peace column, you would cut off the funding.
[00:45:26.252 --> 00:45:27.614]  And I think that's worth a real try.
[00:45:29.015 --> 00:45:36.562]  Number one, if people are from the Tea Party, or Republicans, or Conservative Democrats, they've got to realize this is Al Qaeda.
[00:45:36.922 --> 00:45:41.766]  The people that run Benghazi, and Dana, and Tobruk, those are terrorists.
[00:45:41.846 --> 00:45:45.509]  Those are veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan.
[00:45:45.529 --> 00:45:51.194]  The leader admits he killed Americans in Iraq, and we're unpatriotic because we don't support Al Qaeda, Webster!
[00:45:51.394 --> 00:45:51.895]  There we go.
[00:45:52.515 --> 00:46:12.073]  And the other one, though, is the massacre, the atrocities against black Africans, people from Mali or Somalia or Chad, under the rebel regime, that ought to be enough to move the entire black caucus out of the war column and into the peace column if they're not there already.
[00:46:12.793 --> 00:46:18.719]  And then there's this great man-made river, and the fact that when they talk about revolution,
[00:46:19.725 --> 00:46:22.907]  Everybody in this country will say Gaddafi and his government.
[00:46:23.048 --> 00:46:24.128]  That's the revolution.
[00:46:24.429 --> 00:46:30.433]  That's the anti-colonial, anti-imperialist revolution that actually means something.
[00:46:30.853 --> 00:46:33.916]  Whereas these people in Benghazi, those are monarchists.
[00:46:34.556 --> 00:46:36.738]  Those are religious obscurantists.
[00:46:38.039 --> 00:46:41.441]  They're the Muslim Brotherhood and Al-Qaeda.
[00:46:41.621 --> 00:46:47.726]  Well, they openly want the old British monarchy, back monarchy group, put back in.
[00:46:48.857 --> 00:46:50.759]  Yes, and in fact, that's what they would do.
[00:46:51.259 --> 00:47:15.900]  So, I think militarily, the stuff you hear about the progress of the rebels, this is simply nonsense, but I want to go back to those checkpoints in the night because I want people to understand, if you want to know where the front line of the fight for civilization is, it's those Libyan soldiers, volunteers, women, many of them, standing out there in the night, knowing the only hope of those rebels
[00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:17.441]  We're good to go.
[00:47:34.449 --> 00:47:37.230]  A lot of those people in Benghazi turn out actually to be foreigners.
[00:47:37.290 --> 00:47:37.650]  They're from
[00:47:58.676 --> 00:48:02.278]  From Afghanistan, or Pakistan, or wherever they're from.
[00:48:02.298 --> 00:48:04.298]  They're from Egypt, some of them.
[00:48:04.398 --> 00:48:07.320]  It's same old Al-Qaeda, L-C-I-A-D-A.
[00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:11.181]  Now Webster, their only hope then is to kill Qaddafi.
[00:48:11.461 --> 00:48:13.602]  Qaddafi knows that, he's committed to stay.
[00:48:14.343 --> 00:48:18.284]  And I'm not saying he's an angel, but compared to Al-Qaeda, I mean, I'll pick, you know.
[00:48:18.324 --> 00:48:20.085]  Compared to that, I think we'll take it.
[00:48:21.381 --> 00:48:23.142]  Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm not for Al-Qaeda, folks.
[00:48:23.162 --> 00:48:24.203]  I know that makes me un-American.
[00:48:24.223 --> 00:48:29.185]  I mean, if we're talking real history, you know, our government created Al-Qaeda, and I'm against it, so I'm anti-government.
[00:48:29.245 --> 00:48:35.048]  But now, Webster, their only hope is to kill Qaddafi, and it's on.
[00:48:35.068 --> 00:48:42.271]  I mean, it's now in the news that they're telling Congress behind closed doors, it's come out in major newspapers, that yeah, the invasion is on September, October.
[00:48:42.291 --> 00:48:46.633]  They're going to call it a peace mission, that's also in the news, rolling the tanks in.
[00:48:48.334 --> 00:48:51.497]  Whether this was a good war or not, he didn't even go to Congress.
[00:48:51.537 --> 00:48:52.537]  At least Bush did that.
[00:48:52.918 --> 00:48:54.239]  This is high treason.
[00:48:54.259 --> 00:49:01.665]  And even Nadler, you know, the obese gun grabber up in New York has said, Obama is becoming a king, an emperor.
[00:49:01.705 --> 00:49:02.706]  This is unacceptable.
[00:49:03.466 --> 00:49:08.090]  So this is, anybody who believes in rule of law has got to be against this new war.
[00:49:08.110 --> 00:49:14.035]  Let me just comment on these attempts to kill Gaddafi because I've visited now.
[00:49:14.853 --> 00:49:16.776]  It's a cluster bomb!
[00:49:32.119 --> 00:49:36.243]  Yeah, but it's something more than a cluster bomb, because it's more heavy duty.
[00:49:37.204 --> 00:49:44.471]  It's suitable to destroy something about the size of a football field, but it destroys heavy buildings.
[00:49:45.112 --> 00:49:47.314]  I mean, it's not just a shrapnel fragmentation.
[00:49:49.054 --> 00:49:51.275]  So I've been in Gaddafi's villa.
[00:49:51.295 --> 00:49:52.375]  Now, a couple of things about this.
[00:49:52.815 --> 00:50:11.619]  You go into the room where Gaddafi would receive the visits of African leaders, governments, heads of state, and other diplomatic events of state, and you look at this, this is not the palace of, I don't know, it looks like the
[00:50:12.583 --> 00:50:14.005]  The point is he lives in a tent.
[00:50:14.025 --> 00:50:15.067]  Webster, we gotta go to break.
[00:50:29.492 --> 00:50:29.873]  Absolutely.
[00:50:29.933 --> 00:50:30.873]  I want to come back here.
[00:50:30.913 --> 00:50:33.435]  The point is, they say, oh, look, he's got all this money.
[00:50:33.455 --> 00:50:38.219]  Yeah, he's sitting on gold, knowing that when he got invaded, he would be able to pay for things.
[00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:41.322]  Ladies and gentlemen, a totally illegal U.N.
[00:50:41.362 --> 00:50:47.146]  war backed by al Qaeda started by the West four months ago, a month before the U.N.
[00:50:47.787 --> 00:50:48.928]  ridiculous resolution.
[00:50:49.008 --> 00:50:49.889]  Now the international
[00:50:50.569 --> 00:50:57.494]  Court of Criminals, they are the criminals, is saying arrest Gaddafi and they're telling you this isn't a war as the ground troops are readied off the coast.
[00:50:57.814 --> 00:51:00.016]  From Tripoli, Webster Tarpley straight ahead.
[00:51:00.256 --> 00:51:05.260]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:51:59.855 --> 00:52:04.098]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:52:04.418 --> 00:52:04.999]  Number one.
[00:52:05.319 --> 00:52:09.323]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:52:09.603 --> 00:52:14.147]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:52:14.487 --> 00:52:14.927]  It's true.
[00:52:15.228 --> 00:52:20.652]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:52:20.933 --> 00:52:24.215]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:52:24.516 --> 00:52:28.219]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:52:28.419 --> 00:52:28.960]  Number 4.
[00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:31.582]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:52:31.982 --> 00:52:35.366]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:52:35.666 --> 00:52:35.866]  Number 5.
[00:52:36.447 --> 00:52:40.370]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:52:40.590 --> 00:52:45.355]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:53:04.497 --> 00:53:11.738]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new World Bank to act as savior.
[00:53:11.939 --> 00:53:13.359]  But we've only seen the beginning.
[00:53:13.559 --> 00:53:17.440]  Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times.
[00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:21.300]  Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land.
[00:53:21.540 --> 00:53:25.641]  The insiders have discovered that they must control two things to seize total power.
[00:53:26.001 --> 00:53:30.022]  Phase one is a one-world currency, which we are currently being prepared to accept.
[00:53:30.342 --> 00:53:34.083]  Phase two of their insidious plan is complete control of our food supplies.
[00:53:34.463 --> 00:53:38.746]  Go to www.foodshortageusa.com for the details.
[00:53:39.126 --> 00:53:42.668]  That's www.foodshortageusa.com.

[00:54:07.291 --> 00:54:14.137]  Well, I got a ton of other geopolitical, economic news to cover, and I'm going to keep Webster Tarpey a little bit into the next hour with us.
[00:54:14.157 --> 00:54:16.779]  This is his first interview from Tripoli.
[00:54:16.819 --> 00:54:20.442]  He's been there for several days, left late last week.
[00:54:21.002 --> 00:54:22.183]  Webster, you've got the floor.
[00:54:22.263 --> 00:54:26.207]  Continue to break down what you're witnessing, and what does it signify
[00:54:26.747 --> 00:54:26.947]  Webster.
[00:54:57.692 --> 00:54:58.653]  Break down what's happening.
[00:54:58.673 --> 00:54:59.113]  Continue.
[00:54:59.713 --> 00:55:00.073]  Sure.
[00:55:00.473 --> 00:55:19.039]  The thing you see, you go out sometimes in the daytime or at night and you hear the sound of these NATO aircrafts up in the air and you realize that they can let fly at any time and that they're killing people just about every day.
[00:55:19.099 --> 00:55:22.920]  Now we've been rather lucky here in Tripoli for the last three days.
[00:55:23.661 --> 00:55:28.223]  We haven't had, as far as I can see, any big bombing here in the city.
[00:55:29.003 --> 00:55:37.447]  The bombing has been concentrated in Brega, out on the fighting front against these terrorists along the Mediterranean coast.
[00:55:37.947 --> 00:55:40.488]  But they have a kind of an idea that
[00:55:41.108 --> 00:55:47.194]  Four o'clock in the morning is the hour of the wolf, and that's when the NATO killers can strike, right?
[00:55:47.234 --> 00:55:53.080]  And there's absolutely no warning, and these projectiles break up into eight parts and it destroys a compound.
[00:55:53.660 --> 00:55:58.745]  Another compound we visited was in a place called Sormon, if you look on the map.
[00:55:58.965 --> 00:56:00.206]  S-O-R-M-A-N.
[00:56:00.286 --> 00:56:01.868]  Seventy kilometers west of
[00:56:02.581 --> 00:56:03.802]  of Benghazi.
[00:56:04.122 --> 00:56:05.563]  I'm sorry, of Tripoli here.
[00:56:06.104 --> 00:56:08.245]  And this was the home of an important guy.
[00:56:08.265 --> 00:56:09.887]  They were trying to kill him too.
[00:56:09.927 --> 00:56:12.569]  They tried to kill Gaddafi in his compound.
[00:56:13.109 --> 00:56:27.440]  One of the other generals that joined Gaddafi in the coup d'etat of 1968-69 that overthrew the monarchy and created a modern state, because that's what this is, is a guy called Al-Khwaldi Al-Khamedi.
[00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:28.861]  Al-Khamedi, sorry.
[00:56:28.941 --> 00:56:30.802]  Al-Khwaldi Al-Khamedi.
[00:56:30.842 --> 00:56:31.563]  He's a general
[00:56:32.407 --> 00:56:42.536]  And in this ruined compound of his, you can see a picture of him meeting with Egyptian President Nasser right back in the 60s, presumably.
[00:56:42.556 --> 00:56:44.737]  So this is another one of the top people.
[00:56:45.098 --> 00:56:48.220]  And the NATO bombers were attempting to kill him.
[00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:54.586]  It's a policy of assassination, murder, mayhem, gratuitous killing.
[00:56:55.546 --> 00:57:01.668]  And this was, in some ways, the most heartbreaking, moving event I've seen in the trip so far.
[00:57:02.248 --> 00:57:15.451]  His son is a guy called Khalid Al-Khwaldi, who's an engineer, trained in the United States, talks like an American, speaks English as well as anybody.
[00:57:16.291 --> 00:57:23.933]  And what had happened to him was that his wife had been killed, and his two children had been killed.
[00:57:25.511 --> 00:57:31.535]  One of his children was a four-year-old girl who was going to have her fifth birthday now on the 28th of June.
[00:57:31.555 --> 00:57:34.237]  Another was a four-year-old boy.
[00:57:34.437 --> 00:57:35.898]  But Obama brought them peace.
[00:57:35.958 --> 00:57:36.919]  Webster, hold on.
[00:57:37.739 --> 00:57:40.141]  Obama told the media last week, this is not a war.
[00:57:40.461 --> 00:57:42.162]  He brought peace to that four-year-old.
[00:57:42.542 --> 00:57:43.683]  He's a man of peace.
[00:57:43.923 --> 00:57:45.624]  Al-Qaeda is helping.
[00:57:45.764 --> 00:57:49.047]  How dare you be against... I mean, that four-year-old was...
[00:57:50.180 --> 00:57:53.722]  Another kid, another one of these little kids that just becomes, he just became six.
[00:57:53.842 --> 00:57:57.903]  His birthday had been four days before his death.
[00:57:58.004 --> 00:57:59.004]  It was one of their ads.
[00:57:59.064 --> 00:58:04.366]  And then they had a Sudanese cook, an African guest worker in his life.
[00:58:04.386 --> 00:58:09.869]  So ten people killed at about two, two to three o'clock in the morning when NATO
[00:58:10.849 --> 00:58:16.152]  ...delivers their cowardly strikes from 40,000 feet against defenseless women and children.
[00:58:16.452 --> 00:58:26.097]  And the crowning hypocrisy and depravity of this is NATO claims that this compound was a military base.
[00:58:26.337 --> 00:58:27.478]  Well, I'm sorry.
[00:58:27.958 --> 00:58:28.959]  I walked around this.
[00:58:29.519 --> 00:58:30.600]  We looked in the rubble.
[00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:35.422]  Obviously you don't want to get too close to the rubble because it's filled with depleted uranium.
[00:58:35.702 --> 00:58:37.963]  Oh my gosh, Webster, you've got so much courage.
[00:58:38.244 --> 00:58:38.644]  Stay there.
[00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:47.661]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:50.562 --> 00:58:56.003]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:58:57.223 --> 00:59:01.964]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:59:02.364 --> 00:59:09.026]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:59:11.087 --> 00:59:13.529]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:59:15.151 --> 00:59:17.032]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:59:17.092 --> 00:59:23.478]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:59:24.198 --> 00:59:27.241]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[00:59:29.236 --> 00:59:31.118]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:59:31.378 --> 00:59:32.879]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:59:33.179 --> 00:59:35.721]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:59:36.062 --> 00:59:42.307]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:59:42.687 --> 00:59:44.909]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:59:45.389 --> 00:59:47.431]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[00:59:47.751 --> 00:59:48.251]  Others don't.
[00:59:52.952 --> 00:59:54.876]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.357 --> 00:59:58.122]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:04.793 --> 01:00:08.974]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.614 --> 01:00:10.435]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.215 --> 01:00:12.115]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.755 --> 01:00:16.356]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.956 --> 01:00:21.057]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.118 --> 01:00:28.199]  Webster Tarpley, journalist, investigative reporter, historian, economist, is in Tripoli.
[01:00:31.533 --> 01:00:36.701]  He has visited the homes of families murdered, hit by the, uh, demolition bombs.
[01:00:39.178 --> 01:00:47.044]  And he was just breaking down how they're using Twitter not only to foment these fake revolutions, which the Pentagon admits they're doing, but also to target who to kill.
[01:00:47.645 --> 01:00:49.026]  That's how they get their new intelligence.
[01:00:49.046 --> 01:00:53.129]  They don't have the head of MI6 lie about WMDs, as is now admitted.
[01:00:53.449 --> 01:00:55.011]  They just claim somebody twittered.
[01:00:55.331 --> 01:01:02.036]  That's why CNN and Fox always say, oh look, we're getting weather reports from people on Twitter, is to then kind of legitimize it.
[01:01:02.076 --> 01:01:04.918]  Well, Twitter said Qaddafi was roasting babies.
[01:01:05.619 --> 01:01:06.520]  Please continue, Webster.
[01:01:07.455 --> 01:01:33.113]  Yeah, the way in which the targeting was done of this compound in Sormon, where the ten people were killed, the women and the four, I guess, four children killed, and it's because they're all in the family of this guy, al-Khweldi al-Khamedi, one of Gaddafi's top colleagues, right, so the Revolutionary Command Council, or what that used to be.
[01:01:34.063 --> 01:01:58.978]  The way they seem to have done it, this is now the Libyan contention, clearly, is that they had some infiltrated spotters who got up in a local sort of, you know, microwave tower, and they had some kind of hand-held lasers, and they spotted the roofs of these buildings, and that's what guided the NATO bombs down to do the killing, and somehow
[01:02:00.279 --> 01:02:04.621]  Tip-offs or information went over Twitter, say the Libyans.
[01:02:05.241 --> 01:02:12.604]  So maybe that puts this kiddie new world of the social media in some kind of a different light.
[01:02:13.447 --> 01:02:17.950]  So, I think this is just, it's horrifying, it's disgusting.
[01:02:18.371 --> 01:02:28.858]  As an American, you are confronted what this regime is doing in your name, with your tax money, and I think it's time to do something about it.
[01:02:28.918 --> 01:02:35.603]  The very least anybody can do is, there are going to be these, there's a congressional recess now for the 4th of July.
[01:02:35.623 --> 01:02:38.586]  These characters are going to be around, and you're just going to have to
[01:02:39.486 --> 01:02:49.894]  Go to them and say, look, this war with Libya has to end, and normally the congressional comeback would be, well, we can't abandon our troops who are in harm's way.
[01:02:49.914 --> 01:03:00.062]  Well, in this case, the argument from Obama is there are no troops in harm's way, so there's no, you know, blackmail that can be done on this issue.
[01:03:00.102 --> 01:03:03.805]  You know, you're abandoning the troops, because Obama says there are no troops.
[01:03:03.865 --> 01:03:07.968]  There are troops, but Obama claims that there are not.
[01:03:12.287 --> 01:03:14.929]  Wait a minute, are you challenging Obama?
[01:03:14.969 --> 01:03:18.572]  This is not a war, this is a Nobel Peace Prize movement.
[01:03:19.653 --> 01:03:23.716]  They admit it's killing a lot of women and children, but that's not civilian deaths.
[01:03:24.497 --> 01:03:26.698]  And you know what, Obama's a great guy.
[01:03:26.738 --> 01:03:28.480]  I mean, he cares about us, Webster.
[01:03:29.605 --> 01:03:33.547]  What we had is, the UN resolution says the defense of civilians.
[01:03:33.607 --> 01:03:41.132]  Now the NATO aircraft are acting in defense of armed terrorist gangs and they're killing civilians in the process.
[01:03:41.172 --> 01:03:44.994]  Look, somebody who knows something about peace, a very interesting person to meet.
[01:03:45.515 --> 01:03:48.556]  This is the Bishop of Tripoli, Giovanni Martinelli.
[01:03:49.457 --> 01:03:55.941]  And this is a guy who goes back and forth to the Vatican and has talked to the Pope about this situation.
[01:03:56.713 --> 01:03:56.833]  Yes.
[01:04:11.844 --> 01:04:13.345]  Full religious freedom.
[01:04:13.925 --> 01:04:18.887]  The Roman Catholic Church in Libya can act with perfect freedom.
[01:04:19.307 --> 01:04:23.109]  They have nuns, they have hospitals, they have social services.
[01:04:23.129 --> 01:04:26.591]  It turns out there are a lot of immigrant workers here from the Philippines.
[01:04:27.051 --> 01:04:34.414]  The staffs of the hospitals, of which there are quite a few and actually quite good, are largely Filipino, and most of those are Catholic.
[01:04:34.834 --> 01:04:37.736]  So, the Catholic community here used to be Italian,
[01:04:38.476 --> 01:04:39.878]  But now it's Filipino.
[01:04:40.018 --> 01:04:40.418]  Stay there.
[01:04:40.438 --> 01:04:47.145]  I want to hear... I want to hear about your intel on Western forces that are there, quote, advising and helping with the peace.
[01:04:47.165 --> 01:04:48.306]  I want to get into that.
[01:04:48.346 --> 01:04:50.468]  I want to get into what the bishop said the pope told him.
[01:04:50.989 --> 01:04:57.035]  I want to get into the fact that Italy has just last week said it's time to have a ceasefire and end this.
[01:04:57.395 --> 01:04:58.556]  And then we'll get into the economy.
[01:04:58.576 --> 01:04:59.037]  Stay with us.
[01:05:01.454 --> 01:05:09.962]  The folks at eFoodsDirect have saved you from the huge price increases on food by buying raw materials ahead and packing your supplies themselves.
[01:05:10.443 --> 01:05:14.526]  They haven't increased their prices on great long-term food reserves since last year.
[01:05:14.907 --> 01:05:20.092]  With the rising cost of raw materials and gas prices, they can't hold off any longer.
[01:05:20.752 --> 01:05:28.763]  As of July 1st, Ifu's Direct is forced to increase their prices so they can still ship you the best storable food on the planet.

[01:06:04.207 --> 01:06:05.147]  Tyranny is here.
[01:06:05.468 --> 01:06:09.049]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:06:09.329 --> 01:06:11.630]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:06:11.790 --> 01:06:17.073]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:06:17.493 --> 01:06:23.736]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:06:24.156 --> 01:06:29.700]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:06:30.141 --> 01:06:33.803]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:06:34.324 --> 01:06:38.327]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:06:38.607 --> 01:06:44.131]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:06:44.551 --> 01:06:47.493]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:06:48.114 --> 01:06:49.555]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:06:50.095 --> 01:06:50.536]  It's here.

[01:07:00.999 --> 01:07:02.500]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:07.761]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:07:08.022 --> 01:07:09.382]  Saving means to make money.
[01:07:09.542 --> 01:07:18.325]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:07:19.065 --> 01:07:26.169]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:07:26.609 --> 01:07:34.213]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:07:34.613 --> 01:07:39.535]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:07:39.836 --> 01:07:41.997]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:07:44.718 --> 01:07:50.301]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:50.361 --> 01:07:52.782]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:12.941 --> 01:08:18.487]  I'm going to put a tweet out in the next 10 minutes at twitter.com forward slash realalexjones.
[01:08:19.348 --> 01:08:22.571]  We can use our Pentagon revolution system against them.
[01:08:23.512 --> 01:08:33.022]  And I want to ask all of you that are at twitter.com realalexjones to get the Twitter I put out calling for folks to descend peacefully on the Texas Capitol 4 p.m.
[01:08:33.042 --> 01:08:33.323]  today.
[01:08:34.494 --> 01:08:36.895]  I'll be there entering the Capitol at 4 p.m.
[01:08:37.536 --> 01:08:41.037]  and we're launching this citizen filibuster against this federal power grab.
[01:08:41.057 --> 01:08:53.424]  If they can sit there and stick their hands down your pants and crush your genitals and make 95-year-old cancer patients who are going home to die from Florida to Michigan take their diaper off.
[01:08:54.458 --> 01:08:56.139]  And strip search them, oh yes.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.082]  They can do anything and it's about humiliation.
[01:08:59.162 --> 01:09:02.164]  It's about a federal goon spy force over everything.
[01:09:02.184 --> 01:09:03.485]  It's in the New York Times.
[01:09:04.125 --> 01:09:06.127]  They're spying on doctors now, the feds are.
[01:09:06.307 --> 01:09:07.528]  Getting ready to nationalize them.
[01:09:08.148 --> 01:09:09.769]  Gathering up, and they call it a survey.
[01:09:10.050 --> 01:09:12.191]  They call them and don't let you know who they are.
[01:09:12.632 --> 01:09:19.497]  It's legal and lawful for doctors to have private practices and not accept Medicare and Medicaid, not go under insurance, whatever they want.
[01:09:20.356 --> 01:09:21.437]  They're getting ready to get rid of that.
[01:09:21.878 --> 01:09:22.578]  That's coming up.
[01:09:22.979 --> 01:09:26.022]  We've got the incredible news with the Euro now going into free fall.
[01:09:26.382 --> 01:09:28.284]  Soros says there will be countries that exit.
[01:09:28.625 --> 01:09:30.567]  I want to talk to Tarpley about that in a moment.
[01:09:31.047 --> 01:09:32.008]  But it's so incredible.
[01:09:32.048 --> 01:09:35.572]  This is Webster's first interview since he got into Tripoli a few days ago.
[01:09:35.592 --> 01:09:36.333]  He's been unable.
[01:09:37.013 --> 01:09:38.014]  This was a secret mission.
[01:09:38.054 --> 01:09:40.076]  He didn't want to obviously be stopped trying to get over there.
[01:09:40.717 --> 01:09:41.858]  He's got a lot of courage, folks.
[01:09:41.918 --> 01:09:42.758]  Webster Griffin Tarpley.
[01:09:42.778 --> 01:09:44.039]  He speaks four or five languages.
[01:09:44.699 --> 01:09:46.840]  And he's in North Africa right now, in Tripoli.
[01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:50.462]  And because of bombing, the cell phones were out until today.
[01:09:50.482 --> 01:09:51.762]  It's in the middle of the night.
[01:09:51.782 --> 01:09:53.903]  He's got a cold, but he's joining us.
[01:09:54.724 --> 01:09:58.465]  What do you make of Congress saying, we don't authorize it, but here's the money?
[01:09:59.186 --> 01:10:03.168]  The Italians now shifting gears and saying, we now are against this war.
[01:10:03.208 --> 01:10:04.048]  It's time to stop.
[01:10:04.568 --> 01:10:08.010]  The Germans, as you know, a month and a half ago, pulled completely out.
[01:10:08.450 --> 01:10:14.454]  And then meanwhile, it's on Infowars.com, the British have now announced they're preparing to move forward with a ground force.
[01:10:15.295 --> 01:10:26.862]  They're moving ahead with their fake moral authority, having international court of criminals who routinely kill people before they try them, whether they're guilty or innocent, like Milosevic, regardless what you thought of Slobo.
[01:10:27.643 --> 01:10:29.024]  They're now issuing the arrest warrant.
[01:10:29.344 --> 01:10:31.746]  This is going into high gear, and a top general told
[01:10:32.706 --> 01:10:37.248]  Congress, yes, they're preparing to invade, but it'll be a peace force with heavy armor.
[01:10:37.548 --> 01:10:41.289]  So we've now entered actual 1984, and I guess as U.S.
[01:10:41.309 --> 01:10:47.251]  troops are coming home in body bags, they'll tell us that it's not a war, and that it's a kinetic action Webster.
[01:10:48.598 --> 01:10:56.905]  Well, I think if they really do take that path of absolute strategic insanity, they will face extravagant losses.
[01:10:56.965 --> 01:11:05.432]  Their attack will break down with great loss, and they will be caught in a quagmire which will essentially be open-ended.
[01:11:05.492 --> 01:11:08.294]  And maybe that will lead to the collapse of the Obama regime.
[01:11:08.314 --> 01:11:14.179]  It certainly might lead to the collapse of Sarkozy and Cameron and the other people here
[01:11:14.879 --> 01:11:21.624]  In Europe, I think there's probably the best combination we've got in the United States to put an end to this.
[01:11:22.164 --> 01:11:29.970]  Again, move those 30 votes out of the war column and into the peace column and it'll become even more illegal than it is now.
[01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:32.912]  And you might say, well that's only the House, what can they do?
[01:11:32.932 --> 01:11:34.273]  They can't get it through the Senate.
[01:11:34.553 --> 01:11:36.955]  There is one thing the House can do and that is to impeach.
[01:11:37.735 --> 01:11:39.896]  And maybe that deserves to be brought up.
[01:11:40.296 --> 01:11:42.857]  Obama is in violation of the War Powers Act.
[01:11:43.297 --> 01:11:44.817]  That is a question of life and death.
[01:11:44.897 --> 01:11:51.579]  It's not Miss Lewinsky, and it's not any of this other minutiae, but it's life and death and war and peace.
[01:11:52.159 --> 01:11:55.861]  And Obama really, really needs to be impeached.
[01:11:56.041 --> 01:12:03.423]  And again, I would contrast the depravity of Obama with the very good sense of this Italian bishop, Martinelli,
[01:12:04.133 --> 01:12:08.076]  Well, look, bombs to defend yourself is one thing, but preemptive war?
[01:12:08.436 --> 01:12:11.078]  People ask how the Germans did what they did.
[01:12:11.138 --> 01:12:13.020]  Hitler had all sorts of fancy
[01:12:26.950 --> 01:12:38.298]  Excuse us and reasons to go into Danzig and then Poland and Czechoslovakia and then finally you know into France and this is how this is done.
[01:12:39.139 --> 01:12:48.826]  This is how wars start and it's on record now even Democrats like Nadler and others and Ron Paul has said Obama if he gets away with this has turned the presidency
[01:12:49.526 --> 01:12:54.589]  into an imperial post, and there's no reason to even have a Congress if this is the case.
[01:12:54.649 --> 01:12:56.530]  I mean, this is earth-shattering.
[01:12:56.550 --> 01:12:59.151]  This has never happened in U.S.
[01:12:59.191 --> 01:12:59.531]  history.
[01:12:59.591 --> 01:13:05.254]  I mean, this is... I mean, at least Bush, for his evil wars, got authorization, Webster.
[01:13:06.358 --> 01:13:07.299]  He went through the motions.
[01:13:07.399 --> 01:13:16.704]  Obama has undoubtedly stepped down, and I think you and I have been ahead of that most of the time over the last three years.
[01:13:18.085 --> 01:13:19.606]  Well, Webster, you've been on target.
[01:13:19.626 --> 01:13:27.511]  In Obama deception, you said he's going to invade North Africa as a base to create total destabilization continent-wide.
[01:13:28.031 --> 01:13:30.633]  Obama deception calls it with total precision.
[01:13:30.933 --> 01:13:34.515]  People are now watching it and flipping out that it was made more than two years ago.
[01:13:35.390 --> 01:13:36.491]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:13:36.891 --> 01:13:42.616]  And again, we just need to go from that to taking these actions to shut it down.
[01:13:42.916 --> 01:13:50.783]  The other thing that's amazing, the NATO position, is that Sarkozy, this tin-pot dictator in his own right, depraved,
[01:13:51.818 --> 01:13:55.401]  The story of this guy could not be told without violating the FCC rules.
[01:13:56.481 --> 01:13:58.683]  They say, they refuse to negotiate.
[01:13:58.863 --> 01:14:05.788]  The Libyan government says, come and negotiate, we'll be glad to negotiate with you, no precondition.
[01:14:06.308 --> 01:14:09.810]  And the answer of the British and the French is, no, no negotiations.
[01:14:10.271 --> 01:14:12.252]  And as the Bishop here pointed out,
[01:14:13.027 --> 01:14:17.632]  Dialogue is the daily bread of the Arab and the Bedouin.
[01:14:17.732 --> 01:14:25.520]  It is the characteristic feature of this civilization that there's a constant process of negotiating everything.
[01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:29.945]  It's kind of a deeply rooted cultural tendency.
[01:14:31.126 --> 01:14:33.909]  Instead, what NATO is saying is, no, we don't want any of that.
[01:14:35.811 --> 01:14:38.433]  What they're saying is your fate is sealed.
[01:14:38.813 --> 01:14:43.976]  We're going to come in and destroy your industrial base and carry out our soft kill genocide against you.
[01:14:44.316 --> 01:14:45.637]  And they're saying you have no hope.
[01:14:45.657 --> 01:14:46.197]  We're coming.
[01:14:46.477 --> 01:14:58.924]  And that's going to form total resistance while a bunch of globalist Bilderberg group people sit around playing God, destabilizing North Africa, Middle East, Central Asia, more troops building up in and around Pakistan.
[01:14:59.224 --> 01:15:01.025]  There's no doubt this is leading into World War Three.
[01:15:01.065 --> 01:15:01.886]  Give us one more scene.
[01:15:04.063 --> 01:15:08.367]  A ship arrived in the harbor here in Tripoli yesterday.
[01:15:08.387 --> 01:15:09.448]  It's a beautiful harbor.
[01:15:09.928 --> 01:15:13.011]  It looks kind of like Baltimore, but much newer.
[01:15:13.451 --> 01:15:15.893]  And this is a city of more than 2 million people.
[01:15:15.973 --> 01:15:17.094]  It's the size of what?
[01:15:17.194 --> 01:15:18.155]  Almost Chicago.
[01:15:18.656 --> 01:15:21.919]  It's very large and modern compared to Tunis.
[01:15:21.999 --> 01:15:23.320]  It's much more modern.
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:30.386]  And people that I've talked to here that have been here 5 years ago, 10 years ago, are marveled
[01:15:30.846 --> 01:15:37.331]  By how many new buildings, and the horizon is covered with cranes, buildings are going up everywhere.
[01:15:37.351 --> 01:15:41.795]  The oil money is being used, to a significant degree.
[01:15:42.315 --> 01:15:43.596]  It's being used wisely.
[01:15:43.656 --> 01:15:44.957]  So, here comes the ship.
[01:15:45.237 --> 01:15:48.780]  The ship is coming from Benghazi, and it's carrying refugees.
[01:15:49.100 --> 01:15:50.061]  What kind of refugees?
[01:15:50.421 --> 01:15:52.803]  Refugees fleeing the terrorist regime.
[01:15:53.203 --> 01:15:58.427]  People who don't want to be in Benghazi anymore, and they don't want to have any more grief.
[01:15:59.688 --> 01:16:01.449]  With, uh, with these terrorists.
[01:16:01.469 --> 01:16:06.111]  So they come into here and, uh, and they, uh, you know, they get off the ship.
[01:16:06.491 --> 01:16:13.674]  And here you got, I saw, you know, the Washington Post, the Associated Press, uh, the whole media scrum was there.
[01:16:14.154 --> 01:16:27.740]  I saw the woman who was the correspondent of the first program of French television comes in there and she tries to find a woman who's got an Islamic burka on, right, with this, you know, complete coverage.
[01:16:28.340 --> 01:16:39.310]  And what she's trying to do is to say that it's those fundamentalists that leave Benghazi and come to be with Gaddafi, which absolutely makes no sense.
[01:16:39.330 --> 01:16:40.130]  It's the reverse.
[01:16:40.150 --> 01:16:46.136]  So you're witnessing the corporate media trying to frame it like, ooh, al-Qaeda's with Gaddafi.
[01:16:47.318 --> 01:16:52.222]  They're trying to score points against Gaddafi any way they can, even if it's a total absurdity.
[01:16:52.743 --> 01:17:02.511]  And these press whores on this dock, they have nothing but contempt for the human suffering of the people on that boat who have been forced
[01:17:02.911 --> 01:17:06.313]  Well, they're horrible people that have sold their souls to be part of the system.
[01:17:06.333 --> 01:17:08.134]  They're the most vapid I've met them.
[01:17:08.174 --> 01:17:14.018]  They're just vapid, gibbering, giggling scum who are going to have all their money taken by the bankers.
[01:17:14.058 --> 01:17:16.099]  Don't worry, you little servile snakes.
[01:17:16.439 --> 01:17:20.982]  Your masters are going to really give you some of the same stuff you're giving these North Africans.
[01:17:22.034 --> 01:17:28.881]  And so, therefore, you know, it's time to put an end to the power of these little gargoyles, right?
[01:17:28.901 --> 01:17:32.185]  These little slimeballs of the press.
[01:17:32.265 --> 01:17:34.067]  And simply, the spell is broken.
[01:17:34.107 --> 01:17:34.968]  Nobody can believe them.
[01:17:34.988 --> 01:17:36.650]  They're fools, buffoons.
[01:17:37.130 --> 01:17:38.272]  They're just idiots.
[01:17:39.165 --> 01:17:41.827]  I think this is pretty clear-cut.
[01:17:41.847 --> 01:17:47.631]  There would be much more to say about the dynamics of these terrorists and how they work.
[01:17:48.112 --> 01:17:50.914]  NATO is violating the UN resolutions like mad.
[01:17:50.934 --> 01:17:52.114]  They're flying in weapons.
[01:17:52.695 --> 01:17:58.099]  They have flown in a plane into western Libya with special weapons on board.
[01:17:58.159 --> 01:18:00.881]  They're trying to seize the area along the Tunisian border.
[01:18:01.341 --> 01:18:10.970]  They're of course operating in the middle northern part of the country, especially from Benghazi towards the west.
[01:18:12.031 --> 01:18:23.222]  This one top terrorist by the name of Hassadi had been the boss of Darna, and he'd gotten himself into the world press, and they got embarrassed about him, so they shipped him out to Egypt.
[01:18:23.662 --> 01:18:25.864]  But they seem to have brought him back to Misurata.
[01:18:25.904 --> 01:18:34.230]  Now, if you look at that battle in Misurata, that is the site of one of the biggest steel mills in Africa, one of the biggest industrial plants in any Arab country.
[01:18:34.670 --> 01:18:36.372]  Watch Misurata.
[01:18:36.492 --> 01:18:43.377]  The Libyans are saying that they think that the city of Misurata, the rebels there, are going to get wiped out.
[01:18:43.737 --> 01:18:45.919]  But a couple of things about the terrorists.
[01:18:46.059 --> 01:18:49.802]  Inside this Benghazi rebel council, you have a rivalry.
[01:18:50.547 --> 01:18:53.888]  There are two people who are supposed to be the top military honchos.
[01:18:53.908 --> 01:18:58.710]  You have the guy called Yunus and this other guy called Hafter.
[01:18:58.910 --> 01:19:00.951]  Hafter was the one who was in Northern Virginia.
[01:19:00.971 --> 01:19:05.053]  Yunus had been a minister in one of Gaddafi's governments.
[01:19:05.093 --> 01:19:09.094]  So they fight about precedence, right?
[01:19:09.114 --> 01:19:10.955]  Who's going to be the top commander?
[01:19:11.415 --> 01:19:13.716]  And the way they do it is
[01:19:14.386 --> 01:19:21.871]  You have a unit of rebels out in the field here and then, you know, a couple of miles away you've got a unit commanded by Haftar.
[01:19:21.891 --> 01:19:24.213]  So Yunus has got his group and Haftar's got their group.
[01:19:24.873 --> 01:19:33.138]  One of the ways that these NATO atrocities happen is the Haftar group calls in and they called in NATO airstrikes on the Yunus group.
[01:19:33.819 --> 01:19:35.300]  Both rebels, both terrorists.
[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:38.182]  And the Yunus group does the same thing to the Haftar group.
[01:19:38.202 --> 01:19:41.304]  So one of the reasons NATO is killing the rebels
[01:19:41.784 --> 01:19:48.550]  It's because one rebel group is getting NATO to bomb their rivals and their competition and getting them killed that way.
[01:19:48.650 --> 01:19:50.272]  All right, Lutzer, stop there.
[01:19:50.352 --> 01:19:54.996]  I want to leave Tripoli now and look to Europe and the United States in a short segment coming up.
[01:19:55.336 --> 01:19:59.319]  I want to look at the huge global financial meltdown that's happening, the death of the euro.
[01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:03.803]  Is your church, school, or organization desperately looking for new fundraising ideas?

[01:21:00.081 --> 01:21:04.304]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:21:04.624 --> 01:21:05.244]  Number one.
[01:21:05.544 --> 01:21:08.686]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:21:08.966 --> 01:21:09.547]  Number two.
[01:21:09.827 --> 01:21:14.390]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:21:14.710 --> 01:21:15.170]  It's true.
[01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:20.013]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:21:20.333 --> 01:21:20.893]  Number three.
[01:21:21.154 --> 01:21:24.456]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:21:24.756 --> 01:21:28.438]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:21:28.638 --> 01:21:29.199]  Number 4.
[01:21:29.439 --> 01:21:31.801]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.

[01:23:57.722 --> 01:23:58.382]  Guaranteed.
[01:24:01.044 --> 01:24:03.786]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:24:03.806 --> 01:24:07.589]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:09.926 --> 01:24:14.011]  Well, we'll get updates from Webster Griffin Tarpley in the days to come as long as the phone lines are up.
[01:24:14.051 --> 01:24:17.135]  They've been down from the peace bombs that are being dropped.
[01:24:18.708 --> 01:24:21.269]  Webster also said they're not seeing the helicopters as promised.
[01:24:21.329 --> 01:24:26.291]  Only drone helicopters have been shot down because there are so many RPGs in the citizens' hands.
[01:24:26.791 --> 01:24:34.373]  And again, dictators don't hand out RPGs and millions of Kalashnikovs to a population of six million, which is so outrageous.
[01:24:35.093 --> 01:24:42.476]  But they are going ahead with a ground war because the globalists, again, have to just sell the fact that they can do whatever they want, whenever they want.
[01:24:42.896 --> 01:24:45.317]  When do the Libyans believe the ground invasion's coming?
[01:24:45.337 --> 01:24:48.239]  Our confirmed intel is late September, early October, Webster.
[01:24:49.979 --> 01:24:54.482]  Uh, this part of their thinking is maybe not so obvious.
[01:24:54.562 --> 01:25:01.585]  I mean, what we have tried to convey is the stuff that's in the public domain, thanks to your work and others, right?
[01:25:01.645 --> 01:25:04.466]  What is widely known is also known here.
[01:25:04.486 --> 01:25:08.928]  So I guess they would converge on that, and in some ways they
[01:25:10.633 --> 01:25:14.795]  They really wonder if the ruling elite of the United States is that insane.
[01:25:15.275 --> 01:25:22.579]  On the other hand, they've had plenty of lessons that they are that insane, that that kind of a fight forward is exactly what they're likely to do.
[01:25:23.159 --> 01:25:28.822]  There's a kind of calm waiting going on, right?
[01:25:28.862 --> 01:25:34.264]  Saying we hope that they're not that insane, but if they really are, then we're pretty much ready.
[01:25:34.284 --> 01:25:35.685]  The people are organized.
[01:25:36.005 --> 01:25:37.606]  The tribes are mobilized.
[01:25:38.556 --> 01:25:48.465]  The system of government by town meeting as one... What do they think of Obama now, the great peace god, lovingly giving them bombs?
[01:25:49.806 --> 01:25:56.312]  Basically his magic, his deception act is finished.
[01:25:56.372 --> 01:25:59.995]  That racket is over with for about 99% and the people
[01:26:02.495 --> 01:26:11.679]  The people who still want to give Obama the benefit of the doubt have actually been defecting, as one official here told us.
[01:26:11.719 --> 01:26:13.860]  He said, we had some rats in our government.
[01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:22.504]  We had rats that had gotten into the government over a period of 40 years, and one of the advantages of all this horror is that the rats
[01:26:23.124 --> 01:26:26.485]  Are now gone, so there won't be any need to deal with the rats anymore.
[01:26:26.726 --> 01:26:28.226]  Okay, Webster, we're almost out of time.
[01:26:28.286 --> 01:26:29.247]  Shifting gears now.
[01:26:30.387 --> 01:26:37.250]  Greece's Deputy Prime Minister warns of tanks in the streets, mass suicides if second payoff to the bankers doesn't happen.
[01:26:37.550 --> 01:26:38.610]  He warns Greek Parliament.
[01:26:38.630 --> 01:26:44.693]  London Telegraph, Greek Minister warns of catastrophe if parliamentary revolt leads to austerity bill being blocked.
[01:26:45.553 --> 01:26:48.056]  Continuing, European leaders prepare for Greek default.
[01:26:49.317 --> 01:26:50.899]  Enter the dragon to save the euro.
[01:26:50.919 --> 01:26:54.322]  The Chinese are publicly saying how pathetic England is.
[01:26:54.822 --> 01:26:57.665]  Italy government tensions rise over austerity plans there.
[01:26:58.426 --> 01:27:02.630]  There's a threat to get rid of the US AAA rating if they don't give trillions more to the bankers.
[01:27:02.650 --> 01:27:07.375]  So we're seeing the economic terrorism of the banking cartel if people don't
[01:27:08.035 --> 01:27:11.542]  Raise taxes, cut benefits, and pay everything to the fraudsters.
[01:27:12.042 --> 01:27:14.867]  And now Soros is saying it looks like the euro may collapse.
[01:27:15.228 --> 01:27:16.150]  That's in Bloomberg.
[01:27:16.370 --> 01:27:18.854]  What does that mean, Webster Tarpley, in the three minutes we've got left?
[01:27:19.696 --> 01:27:32.627]  Well, again, the only way to make the dollar look good is to make the euro look very bad, and that's that the attack on the euro by US hedge funds using credit default swaps has been going on now for more than a year and a half, getting to be almost two years.
[01:27:34.528 --> 01:27:39.012]  I would recommend for the Greeks no more bailouts, no austerity program.
[01:27:39.092 --> 01:27:40.193]  Austerity doesn't work.
[01:27:41.094 --> 01:27:42.295]  That's what Papandreou
[01:27:42.355 --> 01:27:48.763]  Well, it's meant to shut their economy down, and they've done the actuaries and said, if we do this, we'll never get out of the fraudulent debt that you created.
[01:27:49.083 --> 01:27:51.687]  So it's third-world-dom they're delivering to them.
[01:27:52.187 --> 01:27:54.150]  And therefore, what they need is a debt moratorium.
[01:27:54.190 --> 01:27:59.817]  They need to declare an immediate unilateral freeze on all payments of debt, principal, and interest.
[01:28:00.618 --> 01:28:05.644]  Uh, with the goal of reducing it by, you know, the maximum amount possible.
[01:28:05.744 --> 01:28:08.768]  If they can get it, you know, minus 90%, they should do that.
[01:28:09.188 --> 01:28:15.056]  But the only way you can successfully negotiate with a banker is to put yourself on an equal footing
[01:28:15.896 --> 01:28:17.958]  These bankers are, of course, zombie bankers.
[01:28:17.998 --> 01:28:22.481]  The irony of the whole thing is that those bankers themselves are more bankrupt than Greece.
[01:28:23.001 --> 01:28:25.563]  And the people that get the bailout is not going to Greece.
[01:28:25.663 --> 01:28:27.284]  No Greek gets any money out of this.
[01:28:27.784 --> 01:28:36.470]  It goes to the Deutsche Bank, 50 billion euros, the French banks, 30 billion euros, and the British banks, maybe 20 billion euros.
[01:28:36.530 --> 01:28:38.531]  So this complete monstrosity.
[01:28:38.772 --> 01:28:39.972]  There's nothing wrong with the Greeks.
[01:28:40.073 --> 01:28:44.696]  They were simply victimized by a cabal of hedge funds with Soros and the rest of them.
[01:28:45.976 --> 01:28:53.058]  And they now admit that it's going to move on to Italy, Portugal, England, the United States, and it's a black hole.
[01:28:53.298 --> 01:28:58.379]  There's no way to ever pay it back, but it consolidates power for the criminals, so they're rampaging forward.
[01:28:58.479 --> 01:29:09.082]  It's a physical impossibility to pay it back, so why not just face the physical impossibility and say, there's no point in ruining the country trying to do something that is prima facie impossible.
[01:29:09.482 --> 01:29:14.623]  Therefore, we're essentially going to freeze this debt with a view to cancelling it at the earliest.
[01:29:15.824 --> 01:29:19.727]  Webster, we want to commend your amazing courage.
[01:29:20.628 --> 01:29:24.771]  They're now admitting that we never came out of the recession, so the truth is starting to dawn here.
[01:29:24.811 --> 01:29:25.672]  You're in Tripoli.
[01:29:26.453 --> 01:29:27.033]  Go with God.
[01:29:27.093 --> 01:29:27.554]  Be safe.
[01:29:27.574 --> 01:29:32.698]  We appreciate you there being a reporter and somebody to observe the reality of what happened.
[01:29:33.279 --> 01:29:34.440]  And be safe, Webster.
[01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:36.642]  Hopefully you can pop back in with us again tomorrow.
[01:29:37.122 --> 01:29:38.664]  Precisely, that's what I'd hope to do.
[01:29:38.964 --> 01:29:42.969]  Let's try to find a little slot and we'll give you an update.
[01:29:42.989 --> 01:29:46.233]  Maybe NATO will come back tonight at the hour of the wolf.
[01:29:46.373 --> 01:29:47.134]  We'll talk to you tomorrow.
[01:29:47.154 --> 01:29:47.695]  Tarpley.net.
[01:29:47.895 --> 01:29:48.355]  Stay with us.
[01:29:48.676 --> 01:29:49.597]  Wayne Madsen coming up.
[01:29:50.338 --> 01:29:51.239]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.739 --> 01:29:53.341]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.262 --> 01:29:56.946]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.977 --> 01:30:04.200]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:30:04.521 --> 01:30:05.121]  Number 1.
[01:30:05.441 --> 01:30:08.584]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:08.864 --> 01:30:09.424]  Number 2.
[01:30:09.725 --> 01:30:14.268]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:14.608 --> 01:30:15.049]  It's true.
[01:30:15.349 --> 01:30:19.912]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:20.233 --> 01:30:20.773]  Number 3.
[01:30:21.053 --> 01:30:24.336]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:30:24.636 --> 01:30:28.339]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:30:28.539 --> 01:30:29.080]  Number 4.
[01:30:29.340 --> 01:30:31.702]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:30:32.102 --> 01:30:35.465]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:30:35.785 --> 01:30:35.986]  Number 5.
[01:30:36.566 --> 01:30:40.489]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:30:40.710 --> 01:30:45.474]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:31:10.170 --> 01:31:14.253]  They haven't increased their prices on great long-term food reserves since last year.
[01:31:14.634 --> 01:31:19.819]  With the rising cost of raw materials and gas prices, they can't hold off any longer.
[01:31:20.479 --> 01:31:28.482]  As of July 1st, eFoods Direct is forced to increase their prices so they can still ship you the best storable food on the planet.

[01:32:01.633 --> 01:32:05.256]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:05.596 --> 01:32:13.722]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:32:14.463 --> 01:32:18.506]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:32:19.086 --> 01:32:29.915]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:32:30.535 --> 01:32:39.559]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:45.122]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:32:45.482 --> 01:32:52.645]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.

[01:33:31.434 --> 01:33:33.638]  Next hour is going to be a giant...
[01:33:34.554 --> 01:33:38.496]  Cornucopia of key news, a news blitz coming up.
[01:33:39.576 --> 01:33:49.801]  Also, I'll get more into the national fight against the federal power grab, the Fourth Amendment attacking, groping of the TSA and all the big developments there.
[01:33:49.821 --> 01:33:53.563]  Also, Obama and his federal spies out after the doctors.
[01:33:54.084 --> 01:33:59.606]  Daily Mail headline, now Obama's sending out snoopers to pose as patients so they can check up on doctors.
[01:34:00.367 --> 01:34:02.027]  The New York Times reporting the same thing.
[01:34:02.047 --> 01:34:02.928]  This has already been going on.
[01:34:05.623 --> 01:34:13.289]  Also, if you go to InfoWars.com, there's a report, Google Updates Page Rank Top Alternative News Aggregator Punished.
[01:34:14.230 --> 01:34:17.813]  And Google's already been taking our honors away on YouTube.
[01:34:17.853 --> 01:34:20.715]  They own it, not letting people see our videos, blocking them.
[01:34:21.696 --> 01:34:23.977]  And then they removed that last week under protest.
[01:34:25.058 --> 01:34:36.261]  Uh, and they're saying that sites and InfoWars and Prison Planet, most of the traffic is our articles and people that write articles for us, but we also post blurbs of articles with a link to them so you can see what we're claiming.
[01:34:36.281 --> 01:34:41.543]  You know, if I say this is happening, that's happening, or we post whole bills, which is, you know,
[01:34:42.103 --> 01:34:43.384]  Absolutely authorized to do.
[01:34:43.525 --> 01:34:45.166]  It's congressional information.
[01:34:45.567 --> 01:34:50.372]  If you repost anything, they're going to quote delist you or start knocking you down the rankings.
[01:34:50.792 --> 01:34:54.956]  And if you throw that back up on screen, I'll read the headline out to folks again.
[01:34:55.457 --> 01:34:59.841]  That's why you need to email your entire email list withinfowars.com.
[01:35:00.842 --> 01:35:05.225]  That's why you need to email your entire email list with PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:35:05.525 --> 01:35:07.426]  That's why you need to tell people about InfoWars.com.
[01:35:07.446 --> 01:35:11.629]  That's why you need to get the bumper stickers and put them on your cars.
[01:35:12.409 --> 01:35:17.512]  Because the sites are scaring the system and they openly admit they're censoring us.
[01:35:17.572 --> 01:35:21.555]  We're being censored at public libraries, universities, military bases.
[01:35:22.035 --> 01:35:24.537]  They have these software packages.
[01:35:25.618 --> 01:35:38.432]  That list things as hacking sites, porn sites, gambling sites, hate sites, and we get listed as hacking sites and as extremist sites so that you can't access it on many public systems.
[01:35:38.692 --> 01:35:41.635]  In Europe, the Watsons have covered that.
[01:35:41.675 --> 01:35:47.021]  So again, putting that article on screen, it's up on Infowars.com.
[01:35:47.962 --> 01:35:57.470]  And the article headline is Google Updates Page Rank Top Alternative News Aggregator Punished by Eric Blair at Infowars.com.
[01:35:58.091 --> 01:36:04.056]  The last time we wrote an article about this, Drudge picked it up, but the headline dealt with overall Google to punish alternative news.
[01:36:04.576 --> 01:36:06.438]  And Drudge is, of course, a pure aggregator.
[01:36:06.458 --> 01:36:10.681]  Well, he writes some articles, but mainly he does research and tracks whatever's the hottest.
[01:36:11.101 --> 01:36:12.703]  So it's targeting all of that.
[01:36:13.749 --> 01:36:29.394]  We need to counter these people, and that's realizing how special these sites are, how important sites like InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and DrugsReport.com and WayneMadisonReport.com and things like that are, because as Hillary said earlier this year, the globalists are losing the info war.
[01:36:29.454 --> 01:36:29.955]  That's a quote.
[01:36:30.735 --> 01:36:36.157]  Because there's so much alternative media doing better, more original reporting and not lying, not spinning.
[01:36:37.051 --> 01:36:42.653]  And so, the newspapers, the mainline sites, the TV, the networks, they're dying, they're in free fall, all of them.
[01:36:42.973 --> 01:36:44.814]  Glenn Beck's going to internet only, pretty much.
[01:36:45.334 --> 01:36:46.114]  You know, on TV.
[01:36:47.395 --> 01:36:51.356]  Howard Stern's talking about, you know, almost left XM just to do it only internet.
[01:36:52.176 --> 01:36:53.697]  Because that's the future.
[01:36:53.717 --> 01:36:54.957]  Well, not under internet too.
[01:36:55.277 --> 01:37:00.279]  They want to start curtailing that and controlling it, and controlling its architecture, and that's what Bilderberg covered 2011.
[01:37:00.319 --> 01:37:00.559]  Now,
[01:37:04.994 --> 01:37:06.375]  We're going to Wayne Madsen here in a moment.
[01:37:06.815 --> 01:37:09.136]  I'm going to be down there today at four o'clock at the Texas Capitol.
[01:37:09.756 --> 01:37:13.017]  Just, if you want to be part of historically, the media called it storming the Capitol.
[01:37:13.677 --> 01:37:14.818]  We didn't storm the Capitol.
[01:37:14.838 --> 01:37:17.819]  It's our right to go in through the metal detectors.
[01:37:17.899 --> 01:37:19.379]  Nice police there, state police.
[01:37:19.399 --> 01:37:22.780]  A lot of them nodding and agreeing with us, you know, that this is wrong.
[01:37:22.860 --> 01:37:25.621]  Unanimous vote of the House against the TSA groping bill.
[01:37:25.661 --> 01:37:26.862]  Cops know they can't do that.
[01:37:26.962 --> 01:37:28.242]  They don't want to do that, most of them.
[01:37:28.522 --> 01:37:29.043]  Why can these
[01:37:30.463 --> 01:37:31.944]  Barely trained TSA people do it.
[01:37:32.064 --> 01:37:41.188]  Now they claim the TSA can read minds off your face, and they admit it's cases of a guy's looking down and looks sad, and they take him in to interrogate him, and he says, I'm going to my brother's funeral.
[01:37:41.508 --> 01:37:42.409]  He died three days ago.
[01:37:42.749 --> 01:37:43.129]  I'm sad.
[01:37:43.149 --> 01:37:45.490]  You know, it's total quackdom.
[01:37:45.750 --> 01:37:52.393]  Now they have computers that scan your face and quote, tell if you're a terrorist, when decades ago they had to admit that lie detector tests were a fraud.
[01:37:52.433 --> 01:37:55.615]  They just have fancier ones now, just a bank of blinking lights.
[01:37:57.875 --> 01:38:00.736]  We're going to break down the treachery by three men.
[01:38:01.776 --> 01:38:08.519]  The Speaker of the House, the Leader of the Senate, and of course, the Governor.
[01:38:09.199 --> 01:38:15.121]  And now, even though he tried to say nice things about him earlier last week, he's having to admit, State Rep.
[01:38:16.221 --> 01:38:22.864]  David Simpson is having to admit that yes, the Republican leadership killed it, and his quote was, why do we even have a House and Senate in Texas then?
[01:38:23.664 --> 01:38:24.365]  So they're killing it.
[01:38:24.385 --> 01:38:25.166]  They have all the votes.
[01:38:25.206 --> 01:38:27.909]  They're killing it, killing it, killing it, and then demonizing it.
[01:38:28.630 --> 01:38:32.615]  So Perry wants to act like he's for this while he tried to keep it off the special session.
[01:38:32.956 --> 01:38:38.022]  We're going to go down there with a citizen filibuster and I've now defined this new term.
[01:38:38.502 --> 01:38:41.706]  That means going in and going up.
[01:38:42.628 --> 01:38:52.452]  to your House and Senate members and telling them to go filibuster or for them to walk out because they got three days left in the special session today, Tuesday, and Wednesday, so that another session has to be called.
[01:38:52.732 --> 01:38:54.493]  We've got a month more to try to pass this.
[01:38:54.853 --> 01:38:58.134]  You're like, but we already, they killed it once, we brought it back, they're killing it again.
[01:38:58.215 --> 01:39:02.076]  It's fight, fight, fight, and expose the politicians for their tricks.
[01:39:02.977 --> 01:39:04.997]  You don't just fight once, you fight over and over again.
[01:39:05.037 --> 01:39:06.218]  It's who wants it most.
[01:39:06.598 --> 01:39:11.000]  Like George Washington, he lost most of the battles over seven years, but he persevered.
[01:39:12.598 --> 01:39:18.121]  Now, we're going to Wayne Madsen here in just a moment, but I want to see you down there at 4 o'clock, or if you can't make it, 9 o'clock, 10 a.m.
[01:39:18.161 --> 01:39:18.581]  tomorrow.
[01:39:18.922 --> 01:39:20.903]  The next three days, go there, talk to them.
[01:39:20.943 --> 01:39:22.143]  That's a citizen filibuster.
[01:39:22.624 --> 01:39:24.305]  You go in and you talk to your representatives.
[01:39:24.725 --> 01:39:25.565]  You understand, folks?
[01:39:26.006 --> 01:39:26.386]  Get there.
[01:39:26.406 --> 01:39:33.330]  4 o'clock today, that's going to be the big event, with just, you know, a little bit of short notice, but I want it to be a lot bigger than a month ago.
[01:39:33.430 --> 01:39:34.850]  Look at the great effect it had.
[01:39:35.351 --> 01:39:39.353]  Now, briefly, let me get over here and get this.
[01:39:40.796 --> 01:39:44.539]  We fund our operation by selling books, t-shirts, and DVDs.
[01:39:46.860 --> 01:39:53.765]  But we also know the economy's dead, and so we've cut the prices down to almost nothing at the online video bookstore at InfoWars.com.
[01:39:53.785 --> 01:40:10.057]  And we're running a special until this Friday, and it's very popular, we launched it last Friday, where you can get my five best-selling, most informative films that'll bring your knowledge to a higher level, even if you already have the knowledge, give it to somebody else, make copies, put them on AXS TV, it's having a huge effect.
[01:40:10.737 --> 01:40:18.944]  The Obama Deception, Terror Storm, Endgame, Fall of the Republic, and Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA.
[01:40:19.684 --> 01:40:25.589]  $29.95, and you get Big Brother, The Orwellian Nightmare Come True, thick, great read book by Mark Dice, free.
[01:40:26.289 --> 01:40:27.430]  We're only running this until...
[01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:29.200]  This Friday.
[01:40:29.580 --> 01:40:31.241]  So again, Big Brother, A Willing Nightmare, Come True.
[01:40:31.761 --> 01:40:36.002]  Already on this, and we're getting rid of this 5 DVD deal for $29.95 on Friday.
[01:40:36.442 --> 01:40:40.764]  This was already a deal we were getting rid of and I said, why not in the last week, give them the free book on top of it.
[01:40:41.504 --> 01:40:43.684]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, I hope you take advantage of it.
[01:40:43.744 --> 01:40:44.245]  InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:40:44.265 --> 01:40:44.305]  888-253-3139.
[01:40:44.345 --> 01:40:49.706]  You can also see all the films at super high quality, the live streaming video, the show, everything at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:40:56.855 --> 01:41:02.560]  Okay, we have the reports here and you can learn more at WayneMadsonReport.com.
[01:41:02.680 --> 01:41:03.961]  I won't go over his whole bio.
[01:41:03.981 --> 01:41:11.828]  He's written for the Village Voice, Counterpunch, CorpWatch, Multinational Monitor, News Insider, The East Times, The American Conservative.
[01:41:12.549 --> 01:41:21.937]  His columns have appeared in the Miami Herald, Houston Chronicle, Philadelphia Inquirer, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Sacramento Bee, Columbus Dispatch, formerly worked with the Navy, then the NSA, then RCA.
[01:41:23.237 --> 01:41:31.144]  He's been everywhere, Al Jazeera, ABC, MSNBC, and he also was one of the founding members of EPIC.
[01:41:31.705 --> 01:41:33.947]  He joined Great Defenders of Free Speech and Liberty.
[01:41:34.287 --> 01:41:36.950]  Wayne Madsen has been to Tripoli on occasions.
[01:41:36.990 --> 01:41:47.059]  He's going to give us his inside take on what's really happening there and the rest of the world right now and how big this unauthorized war is, what it means to our Constitution.
[01:41:47.319 --> 01:41:48.981]  Wayne, thanks for joining us via video Skype.
[01:41:50.148 --> 01:41:51.648]  Hi Alex, good to be with you.
[01:41:51.988 --> 01:41:53.009]  Good to have you there, my friend.
[01:41:53.969 --> 01:41:55.049]  So, break down the latest.
[01:41:55.069 --> 01:41:57.309]  I mean, you've been to Tripoli, you've covered it, what's happening?
[01:41:58.410 --> 01:42:06.711]  Okay, well I was over in Tripoli on a dignity delegation that the former representative Cynthia Mitchell put together.
[01:42:06.791 --> 01:42:14.813]  I had been with her in October 2009 and she asked for journalists to go back because
[01:42:16.058 --> 01:42:20.661]  She said, look, what's happening here is not being reported by the Western media.
[01:42:20.761 --> 01:42:40.773]  And sure enough, after we flew to Milan, and then to Tunis, and then took a plane from Tunis to the island of Djerba, right near the Libyan-Tunisian border, and then went by car because of the air embargo, Tripoli, it was quite clear that we saw no
[01:42:42.281 --> 01:42:46.606]  Current signs of rebel activity anywhere from the Tunisian border to Tripoli.
[01:42:46.967 --> 01:42:49.250]  As a matter of fact we came across one.
[01:42:50.347 --> 01:42:56.008]  Okay, Wayne, your video Skype was clear.
[01:42:56.368 --> 01:42:57.449]  Now the audio's breaking up.
[01:42:58.029 --> 01:43:01.549]  While they just try to go audio only on Skype, if that doesn't work, we'll call you on phone.
[01:43:02.089 --> 01:43:04.650]  While we get this key intelligence, again, you've been there several times.
[01:43:04.670 --> 01:43:08.271]  You just returned from a trip there for folks who had trouble making that out.
[01:43:08.891 --> 01:43:09.851]  And this is a big deal.
[01:43:09.991 --> 01:43:13.612]  I mean, even Democrats and Republicans are saying Obama is becoming an emperor.
[01:43:14.634 --> 01:43:15.915]  And saying the U.N.
[01:43:15.935 --> 01:43:16.776]  is his authority.
[01:43:17.296 --> 01:43:18.417]  He doesn't need Congress.
[01:43:18.457 --> 01:43:25.003]  Congress, traitorously, tried to give him authorization a few weeks ago, and Obama said, I don't need your stinking authorization.
[01:43:25.043 --> 01:43:25.824]  This isn't a war.
[01:43:26.384 --> 01:43:27.305]  It's humanitarian.
[01:43:27.325 --> 01:43:27.725]  The U.N.
[01:43:27.785 --> 01:43:28.266]  says so.
[01:43:29.107 --> 01:43:32.930]  And they got drones murdering whole families, bombing apartment buildings.
[01:43:33.010 --> 01:43:34.051]  I mean, it is on.
[01:43:34.791 --> 01:43:38.975]  And they are just... Okay, Wayne, continue.
[01:43:38.995 --> 01:43:41.317]  So you just got back from Tripoli.
[01:43:41.337 --> 01:43:42.158]  Break down what's happening.
[01:43:42.921 --> 01:43:50.063]  Right, there was no current sign of rebel activity anywhere from the Tunisian border all the way into Tripoli.
[01:43:50.844 --> 01:43:55.045]  There had been back in when the rebellion first started in February.
[01:43:55.105 --> 01:44:10.050]  It looks like the NATO countries may have inserted people in the area to cause problems, but we came across an impromptu pro-Qaddafi demonstration on the main coastal highway from the Tunisian border into Tripoli.
[01:44:10.130 --> 01:44:11.130]  Once we got to Tripoli,
[01:44:11.730 --> 01:44:20.158]  Life was normal and this was not being reported by the media that's ensconced at the Rixos Hotel in downtown Tripoli.
[01:44:20.518 --> 01:44:24.361]  Life was normal except for the constant nightly NATO bombardments.
[01:44:24.501 --> 01:44:30.687]  The only planes you could hear of course in the air at night were NATO aircraft and you knew when you heard them
[01:44:31.307 --> 01:44:43.779]  Get ready because the bombs are coming next and sure enough you'd see the explosions and feel the rumble if you were outside at night and you would also feel it as I did in the hotel room.
[01:44:44.180 --> 01:44:45.761]  I was on the 10th floor.
[01:44:45.781 --> 01:44:47.843]  You mean you would see the kinetic piece?
[01:44:48.504 --> 01:44:51.086]  Yes, we would see the kinetic military action.
[01:44:51.486 --> 01:44:58.590]  They were constantly bombarding the Qaddafi military compound, which was about a kilometer and a mile from our hotel.
[01:44:59.310 --> 01:45:04.133]  This was where people were gathering every night, offering themselves as human shields.
[01:45:04.193 --> 01:45:11.057]  These were people, men, women, kids from all walks of life going there after they got off from work.
[01:45:11.577 --> 01:45:12.318]  We're good to go.
[01:45:30.334 --> 01:45:31.195]  What's wrong with him?
[01:45:31.235 --> 01:45:35.817]  And this was a constant question we were asked by the people of Libya.
[01:45:36.177 --> 01:45:44.681]  There were even traffic policemen out on the streets directing traffic who were not even armed.
[01:45:44.761 --> 01:45:46.822]  So the fact is that people like
[01:45:48.530 --> 01:45:53.873]  People like John Burns from the New York Times, one of these war correspondents that goes from U.S.
[01:45:53.913 --> 01:45:54.473]  war to U.S.
[01:45:54.513 --> 01:45:57.174]  war and broadcasts Pentagon propaganda.
[01:45:57.494 --> 01:46:06.759]  And Simon Denyer, formerly from Reuters and now with the Washington Post, basically broadcasting or writing from Tripoli that, you know, the city's under siege.
[01:46:07.259 --> 01:46:08.340]  Life is not normal.
[01:46:08.360 --> 01:46:09.640]  Qaddafi's on the ropes.
[01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:10.621]  None of this was true.
[01:46:10.641 --> 01:46:15.163]  This was rank propaganda from these and other journalists.
[01:46:15.823 --> 01:46:19.084]  So it's like the Rough Riders charging a hill where no one was.
[01:46:19.504 --> 01:46:25.827]  It's like Hearst Publishing, you give me the photos, the paintings, the illustrations, I'll give you the war.
[01:46:26.647 --> 01:46:31.349]  Or more recently... But you have seen the Qaddafi forces running around naked with bottles of Viagra, though.
[01:46:32.129 --> 01:46:36.951]  Yeah, yeah, well that's another one, you know, and that wasn't true.
[01:46:37.691 --> 01:46:41.233]  Of course, here's another thing, and this gets to more serious issues.
[01:46:41.553 --> 01:46:44.534]  There have been many people who originally went with the rebels.
[01:46:45.154 --> 01:46:46.435]  We're good to go.
[01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:19.839]  NATO bombing rebels by mistake quote-unquote by mistake it's quite clear from intelligence I picked up from people in Tripoli that some of these rebel movements were rebels trying to get back to Tripoli to rejoin Gaddafi to fight with him against the NATO invasion and that's why they were targeted by NATO.
[01:47:20.993 --> 01:47:33.631]  Tarpley was on with us earlier, Webster Tarpley, he says also some of the rebel groups are calling in airstrikes on other rebel groups that they're fighting with over power and that it's a type of high-tech fragging.
[01:47:34.778 --> 01:47:35.399]  Well, that's it.
[01:47:35.499 --> 01:47:42.567]  And the other thing that's very disconcerting is there is an economic embargo against Western Libya.
[01:47:43.168 --> 01:47:49.455]  Even fishing vessels can't go out to get their daily catch because they're interdicted by NATO vessels.
[01:47:49.515 --> 01:47:51.877]  And that's genocide right there, keeping folks from food.
[01:47:52.518 --> 01:47:54.559]  Right, and there's also the gas shortage.
[01:47:55.060 --> 01:47:57.181]  There's long, long gas lines.
[01:47:57.541 --> 01:47:59.223]  Some of them miles and miles long.
[01:47:59.303 --> 01:48:03.265]  Taxis have one, trucks have another for diesel, others.
[01:48:03.525 --> 01:48:04.866]  But here you have ambulances.
[01:48:04.926 --> 01:48:07.048]  We're bombing civilian residences.
[01:48:07.648 --> 01:48:11.391]  And there's a shortage of gasoline even for ambulances.
[01:48:11.951 --> 01:48:13.372]  This is collective punishment.
[01:48:13.752 --> 01:48:19.996]  This is no different than the collective punishment that we see Israel do against the people of Gaza.
[01:48:20.036 --> 01:48:22.078]  NATO's doing the same thing against the people
[01:48:22.498 --> 01:48:22.738]  I think?
[01:48:40.209 --> 01:48:41.089]  I don't think so.
[01:49:03.054 --> 01:49:09.996]  It wanted to blame Gaddafi because he needed Iran to stay neutral because he had designs on invading Iraq in those days.
[01:49:10.416 --> 01:49:12.156]  Operation Desert Storm.
[01:49:12.596 --> 01:49:18.057]  So, the people of Libya are wondering why are you attacking us?
[01:49:18.117 --> 01:49:19.278]  We've never attacked you.
[01:49:19.298 --> 01:49:23.679]  What do they think of the statements by the governments that this isn't war?
[01:49:25.459 --> 01:49:26.780]  Well, of course they know it's war.
[01:49:26.820 --> 01:49:30.402]  Now, after I left, I was there for a little over four days.
[01:49:30.943 --> 01:49:32.744]  Cynthia McKinney stayed even longer.
[01:49:33.104 --> 01:49:36.066]  And then after we left, of course, now they're bombarding during the day.
[01:49:36.166 --> 01:49:38.787]  So it's day and nighttime bombardment.
[01:49:38.827 --> 01:49:41.989]  And they're trying to basically wear the people down.
[01:49:42.630 --> 01:49:45.892]  All the information warfare going on.
[01:49:46.732 --> 01:49:47.673]  One thing that wasn't
[01:49:47.893 --> 01:49:48.534]  We're good to go.
[01:50:06.110 --> 01:50:20.040]  When the rebels took over Benghazi, they looted the central bank of Benghazi of $900 million in Libyan dinars in cash and $500.5 million in U.S.
[01:50:20.441 --> 01:50:21.782]  dollar currency.
[01:50:22.142 --> 01:50:24.784]  And now they want the Libyan assets unfrozen.
[01:50:25.104 --> 01:50:31.770]  Even people in our Treasury Department don't want to do that because they say, look, they've siphoned off all this money out of the
[01:50:32.190 --> 01:50:33.331]  Libyan Central Bank.
[01:50:33.351 --> 01:50:36.594]  Now they want to steal more money, obviously, to put in their Swiss bank account.
[01:50:36.614 --> 01:50:43.820]  And we know that there's Al-Qaeda commanding it, and we're unpatriotic for saying don't give billions of dollars to Al-Qaeda.
[01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:44.621]  Stay there.
[01:50:44.701 --> 01:50:50.906]  I want to get your take on the, it's now admitted in Congress, they're getting ready for a ground invasion, late September, early October.
[01:50:51.206 --> 01:50:52.327]  You've been there repeatedly.
[01:50:52.728 --> 01:50:58.072]  What do you predict will happen when the first CAV under III Corps goes in?
[01:50:58.152 --> 01:50:59.313]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:51:00.114 --> 01:51:02.735]  Since 2007, the Federal Reserve and the U.S.
[01:51:02.815 --> 01:51:07.116]  government have injected as much as $20 trillion into the economies of the world.
[01:51:07.316 --> 01:51:10.097]  And yet the globe's economies continue to contract.
[01:51:10.357 --> 01:51:13.477]  Our government is borrowing $58,000 per second.
[01:51:13.637 --> 01:51:16.158]  If they stop spending, the economy collapses.
[01:51:16.358 --> 01:51:18.959]  If they continue spending, the economy collapses.
[01:51:19.239 --> 01:51:22.400]  And if they raise interest rates, the economy collapses.
[01:51:22.520 --> 01:51:23.120]  Prepare now!
[01:51:23.840 --> 01:51:28.302]  Call Ready Reserve Foods and put your plan together with quality, storable food.

[01:51:59.833 --> 01:52:02.156]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:52:02.216 --> 01:52:04.458]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:52:04.538 --> 01:52:07.742]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:52:07.762 --> 01:52:12.508]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:52:12.868 --> 01:52:17.053]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:52:17.373 --> 01:52:19.696]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:52:19.716 --> 01:52:22.240]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:52:22.260 --> 01:52:25.183]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:52:25.524 --> 01:52:33.134]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:52:33.450 --> 01:52:38.695]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:52:38.835 --> 01:52:41.657]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:52:41.697 --> 01:52:45.120]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:52:45.380 --> 01:52:46.301]  And I got news for you.
[01:52:46.461 --> 01:52:47.762]  You're everyone else.
[01:52:47.782 --> 01:52:48.783]  Invisible Empire.

[01:52:58.735 --> 01:53:01.096]  What would you do with a check for $25,000?
[01:53:01.256 --> 01:53:06.378]  What if you could eliminate all of your credit card debt in 90 days and keep all of your money?
[01:53:06.558 --> 01:53:16.841]  Hi, I'm Jason Davenport, and I've just completed Zerodet100.com, a program that stops and prevents debt collections of all kinds, including debt collectors and foreclosures, with guaranteed results.
[01:53:17.081 --> 01:53:18.322]  Forget loan modifications.
[01:53:18.402 --> 01:53:24.564]  Zerodet showed me how to get the banks to pay my property taxes and insurance while stopping my foreclosure without paying one dime.
[01:53:24.744 --> 01:53:30.030]  An attorney tried to garnish my wages, but the court denied his request because of what I filed from the Zero Debt Program.
[01:53:30.191 --> 01:53:33.214]  Find out how I did this by calling Zero Debt today at 800-477-9256.
[01:53:34.496 --> 01:53:42.906]  Tell them Jason sent you and ask for the Zero Debt Special and the free bonus promotion about stopping an IRS levy and getting your money back.
[01:53:43.066 --> 01:53:44.608]  Tell them Jason sent you and call 800-477-9256.
[01:53:44.628 --> 01:53:44.688]  800-477-9256.
[01:53:44.708 --> 01:53:44.888]  That's 800-477-9256.

[01:54:02.553 --> 01:54:18.004]  Four o'clock today, Central, we're marching into the Texas Capitol to go in there and talk to our representatives in the House and Senate that have allowed the governor
[01:54:19.093 --> 01:54:28.066]  The head of the Senate, the Lieutenant Governor, and the head of the House, the Speaker, to kill the bill that was going to be voted on unanimously.
[01:54:28.086 --> 01:54:30.430]  Well, it's been voted on unanimously before.
[01:54:30.470 --> 01:54:32.934]  They had almost unanimous votes lined up.
[01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:39.364]  Perry was forced to put it on special session, and now he wants to be able to have his cake and eat it too.
[01:54:39.404 --> 01:54:43.227]  That's his specialty, is to even introduce bills that he later secretly kills.
[01:54:43.347 --> 01:54:46.090]  It's unbelievable dirt-baggedness.
[01:54:47.291 --> 01:54:52.695]  So, what do you expect from Al Gore's former Chief of Staff campaign manager?
[01:54:52.855 --> 01:54:53.616]  Oh, you didn't know that?
[01:54:53.976 --> 01:54:55.317]  Yeah.
[01:54:55.557 --> 01:54:58.120]  Now, continuing here with Wayne Madsen.
[01:55:00.874 --> 01:55:01.815]  You're there in D.C.
[01:55:01.835 --> 01:55:02.676]  You're covering all this.
[01:55:02.696 --> 01:55:03.797]  You're getting ready to leave the U.S.
[01:55:03.837 --> 01:55:04.037]  again.
[01:55:04.077 --> 01:55:04.918]  You've been to Tripoli.
[01:55:06.340 --> 01:55:08.261]  They're now admitting they're getting ready for a U.S.
[01:55:08.462 --> 01:55:12.586]  slash British slash NATO peace force that will invade Tripoli.
[01:55:13.126 --> 01:55:16.209]  And they're saying, you will not resist us or it's terrorism.
[01:55:16.730 --> 01:55:19.593]  So now we're going to have the spectacle of heavy armor rolling and firing.
[01:55:20.033 --> 01:55:21.775]  And if you fire back, you're now a terrorist.
[01:55:21.835 --> 01:55:24.358]  I mean, this is this is total mind control.
[01:55:25.512 --> 01:55:35.860]  Well, that's right, and what we do know is that the Libyan government is distributing 1.3 million weapons to people in Western Libya.
[01:55:36.281 --> 01:55:43.106]  I spoke to one Libyan official who said, look, we have something really nice cooked up for the American troops when they arrive.
[01:55:43.426 --> 01:55:45.308]  They're really going to like what we're going to serve them.
[01:55:45.728 --> 01:55:49.251]  Obviously, he's not talking about meals ready to eat.
[01:55:49.271 --> 01:55:51.713]  Well, that guy's a terrorist!
[01:55:52.293 --> 01:55:56.196]  He should join Al Qaeda in the East and join the people that run America.
[01:55:56.496 --> 01:55:58.938]  He should thank them for the bombs killing children everywhere.
[01:55:58.958 --> 01:56:03.461]  And how dare him say that he would fight back against tanks with a gun.
[01:56:03.501 --> 01:56:04.302]  He's a coward.
[01:56:04.762 --> 01:56:05.043]  Right.
[01:56:05.423 --> 01:56:13.609]  And I'll tell you the other thing that's not being reported is the 1.3 billion dollars stolen by Goldman Sachs from the Libyan Sovereign Wealth Fund.
[01:56:14.009 --> 01:56:18.813]  It's quite clear that this was part of an investigation being conducted by the Qaddafi government.
[01:56:19.273 --> 01:56:28.663]  The anti-corruption agency was looking at the siphoning off of billions of dollars from Libyan oil revenue by certain government ministers.
[01:56:28.723 --> 01:56:29.624]  And isn't it funny?
[01:56:29.845 --> 01:56:34.370]  Almost to a person, these are the very ministers who defected to the rebels.
[01:56:34.870 --> 01:56:39.052]  Heralded, oh, they're quitting Gaddafi, going to the other side.
[01:56:39.072 --> 01:56:46.697]  They went to the other side because they were about ready to be indicted and they were going to go on trial for fraud and siphoning off that money.
[01:56:46.837 --> 01:56:59.404]  And it's thought that when Saif Gaddafi's son said, look, we bankrolled Sarkozy's 2007 presidential campaign in France, that some of that money from Goldman Sachs may have been the money that
[01:57:00.284 --> 01:57:01.405]  Well, of course.
[01:57:01.425 --> 01:57:02.386]  He made a deal with them.
[01:57:02.426 --> 01:57:03.327]  It's in mainstream news.
[01:57:03.347 --> 01:57:04.608]  They stole tens of billions.
[01:57:05.088 --> 01:57:09.772]  But again, Wayne, you want me to believe Goldman Sachs would double-cross somebody?
[01:57:10.113 --> 01:57:12.875]  That is how... Goldman Sachs are good people.
[01:57:13.455 --> 01:57:13.996]  Oh, yeah.
[01:57:14.336 --> 01:57:15.557]  And the other thing, isn't it funny?
[01:57:15.597 --> 01:57:17.359]  It's Sarkozy who was the first to...
[01:57:17.879 --> 01:57:19.100]  Go after Libya.
[01:57:19.160 --> 01:57:20.960]  He was the first to recognize the rebels.
[01:57:21.361 --> 01:57:32.125]  Obviously, the first target of the NATO aircraft happened to be the anti-corruption agency in Tripoli that had all the files on all this missing money.
[01:57:32.766 --> 01:57:34.746]  Well, we all know our government's good.
[01:57:34.807 --> 01:57:35.827]  That wouldn't be happening.
[01:57:36.187 --> 01:57:37.448]  Come on, they're fighting.
[01:57:37.988 --> 01:57:39.989]  They're fighting to give freedom to Al-Qaeda, man.
[01:57:41.249 --> 01:57:42.229]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:57:42.289 --> 01:57:50.091]  I mean, I wish we saw the video because I also, we went to the bombed out residence of Qaddafi's son and I picked up a piece of rubble.
[01:57:50.531 --> 01:57:57.713]  I'm going to try to have this tested for depleted uranium, but it's quite clear that NATO said that was a military target.
[01:57:58.133 --> 01:57:59.113]  Well, it happened.
[01:57:59.673 --> 01:58:05.775]  The only thing I saw in the compound, there was a petting zoo where Muammar Qaddafi was feeding the animals.
[01:58:06.095 --> 01:58:10.079]  When they hit the main structure, that's the only reason he survived.
[01:58:10.239 --> 01:58:11.641]  So they were trying to kill him.
[01:58:12.081 --> 01:58:17.387]  I picked up this piece of rubble next to the First Lady Olivia's handbag and a shoe.
[01:58:17.947 --> 01:58:21.131]  How would somebody like to go to Camp David and find the singed...
[01:58:21.731 --> 01:58:23.832]  Handbag and shoe of the First Lady, Michelle Obama.
[01:58:23.852 --> 01:58:26.634]  Well, that handbag is actually a proton bomb.
[01:58:27.314 --> 01:58:36.518]  And those camels and rabbits, whatever they had, are actually big vampiric fangs like in the Monty Python Holy Grail, the deadly rabbit that did it.
[01:58:36.538 --> 01:58:38.399]  I mean, that rabbit can attack tanks.
[01:58:38.499 --> 01:58:39.320]  It's evil.
[01:58:41.601 --> 01:58:43.402]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:58:51.269 --> 01:58:54.913]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:58:55.293 --> 01:58:58.297]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:58:58.537 --> 01:59:03.342]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:59:03.362 --> 01:59:09.609]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:59:09.729 --> 01:59:11.972]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:59:12.512 --> 01:59:12.792]  Tim Geithner?
[01:59:12.812 --> 01:59:13.232]  Bernanke?
[01:59:13.313 --> 01:59:14.073]  They're arsonists!
[01:59:14.113 --> 01:59:15.254]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:59:15.274 --> 01:59:17.515]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:59:31.403 --> 01:59:33.243]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:59:33.523 --> 01:59:38.325]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.

[02:00:06.010 --> 02:00:07.031]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:07.771 --> 02:00:08.891]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:09.531 --> 02:00:10.352]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.112 --> 02:00:12.032]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.672 --> 02:00:16.293]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.853 --> 02:00:20.955]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.615 --> 02:00:29.437]  Well, the global banking cartel that sees Europe and the United States as mopping up sovereign nations they don't control.
[02:00:31.189 --> 02:00:41.154]  And they're racing to openly get U.S., British, and other NATO ground forces on the ground for the non-military action, which is now admittedly being set up.
[02:00:41.194 --> 02:00:42.474]  That's in the news yesterday and today.
[02:00:42.514 --> 02:00:43.395]  The British, the U.S.
[02:00:43.435 --> 02:00:51.578]  are saying, yeah, we're going to invade and be on the ground, but it's not going to be, you know, on the ground military action, even though there's already reportedly U.S.
[02:00:51.598 --> 02:00:55.900]  troops, too, that have been killed, mercenaries dying, videos of them directing artillery.
[02:00:56.501 --> 02:00:56.881]  It's on.
[02:00:57.521 --> 02:01:02.743]  And they're racing to go ahead and get the full war going, because then a lot of people will still say, well, gotta support the tribes.
[02:01:02.803 --> 02:01:05.704]  Well, how about you support them by not putting them in illegal wars?
[02:01:05.724 --> 02:01:12.806]  You know, if you were in Nazi Germany in 1939, it would be supporting the tribes to not go along with invading Poland.
[02:01:13.746 --> 02:01:16.147]  But America's gonna end up being known like Nazi Germany.
[02:01:17.086 --> 02:01:21.870]  And let it be on record that I spoke out against this and I was against this and having the U.N.
[02:01:21.890 --> 02:01:27.374]  tell the President what to do so Sarkozy and others can bag all that cash they stole from the Libyans.
[02:01:27.494 --> 02:01:32.538]  But continuing here, they've already double-crossed their old dictator Mubarak.
[02:01:32.899 --> 02:01:34.620]  Now they're going after Gaddafi, made deals with him.
[02:01:35.020 --> 02:01:40.365]  What signal does this send to other leaders around the world about playing footsie with the New World Order, Wayne?
[02:01:41.277 --> 02:01:44.458]  Well, let's look what happened just in Tehran the last few days.
[02:01:44.758 --> 02:01:50.301]  We had an anti-terrorism summit in Iran, attended by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and who shows up?
[02:01:50.341 --> 02:01:57.424]  President Talabani of Iraq, President Karzai of Afghanistan, and President Zardari of Pakistan, all supposedly U.S.
[02:01:57.524 --> 02:02:02.466]  allies, going to hear people in Iran say the United States is a terrorist nation.
[02:02:02.826 --> 02:02:03.886]  So, what does that do?
[02:02:04.267 --> 02:02:07.108]  All of our supposed allies are running away from us.
[02:02:07.848 --> 02:02:17.039]  Hey, you know, we gotta throw in our lot with Iran and the other countries and build up a coalition and an axis of intelligence against the Saudis.
[02:02:17.139 --> 02:02:21.003]  And the Saudis have run to the Russians and so have the Pakistanis to the Chinese.
[02:02:21.624 --> 02:02:22.184]  Absolutely.
[02:02:23.025 --> 02:02:35.018]  And the other thing is, I've got up on my website, my homepage today, 1998 Libyan request for an Interpol red notice arrest warrant against Osama Bin Laden.
[02:02:35.799 --> 02:02:36.579]  It was granted.
[02:02:37.140 --> 02:02:37.781]  There was an arrest.
[02:02:37.841 --> 02:02:42.205]  Now today the International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Muammar Gaddafi.
[02:02:43.166 --> 02:03:01.680]  The International Criminal Court never issued one of those for Osama Bin Laden, ever, in its existence since 2002, because I think the reason they had to stage this phony death of Bin Laden was, what if Qaddafi's captured, put on trial in the Hague, and says, well, I want to call Bin Laden as a witness, because I was the first
[02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:13.244]  World leader to put in an arrest warrant against this guy because the British and military intelligence and CIA were using Bin Laden to try to kill me, Muammar Gaddafi.
[02:03:13.624 --> 02:03:14.924]  Wouldn't that have been embarrassing?
[02:03:15.264 --> 02:03:16.965]  So dead men tell no tales.
[02:03:17.025 --> 02:03:23.107]  They had to officially declare Bin Laden dead with that phony operation.
[02:03:23.147 --> 02:03:28.669]  Well it's very un-American for you to talk about Bin Laden now that they're our main allies fighting Gaddafi.
[02:03:29.469 --> 02:03:32.471]  I mean, next George Washington's going to be a bad guy.
[02:03:32.511 --> 02:03:33.632]  You're some kind of sicko.
[02:03:34.252 --> 02:03:39.235]  So am I, I guess, because I think this is a war and the government says it's not, so let's not be conspiracy theorists.
[02:03:39.275 --> 02:03:41.876]  Wayne Madsen of thewaynemadsenreport.com.
[02:03:41.976 --> 02:03:46.159]  In closing, do you think overall, I mean, NATO can't back off now.
[02:03:46.179 --> 02:03:47.380]  Do you think the ground invasion's on?
[02:03:48.380 --> 02:03:51.842]  Well, we already see the Italians wanting to leave the coalition.
[02:03:51.862 --> 02:03:52.822]  They want to cease fire.
[02:03:53.162 --> 02:03:57.625]  I think what we're going to see is the coalition is going to fray.
[02:03:58.085 --> 02:04:01.267]  And if anybody goes in, guess who it's going to be?
[02:04:01.307 --> 02:04:04.428]  It's going to be U.S., maybe French and British ground troops.
[02:04:04.528 --> 02:04:05.689]  And that's going to be it.
[02:04:06.474 --> 02:04:07.275]  And what do you predict?
[02:04:07.315 --> 02:04:08.355]  You've been there many times.
[02:04:08.816 --> 02:04:10.357]  What do you predict is going to happen to those troops?
[02:04:10.957 --> 02:04:12.518]  A bloodbath.
[02:04:12.899 --> 02:04:20.164]  If I were able to invest money, I would be investing money in companies that sell coffins and body bags to the Pentagon.
[02:04:22.126 --> 02:04:24.427]  Yeah, because the North Africans will fight like the devil.
[02:04:25.528 --> 02:04:26.068]  Absolutely.
[02:04:27.142 --> 02:04:27.702]  Absolutely.
[02:04:28.543 --> 02:04:37.047]  And 1.3 million armed Libyans, including the Home Guard, women, they're all going to go out and welcome the Americans with the AK-47s.
[02:04:40.327 --> 02:04:47.289]  Well, I mean, look, I'm pro-U.S., so I'm with Al Qaeda now, and I'm... Just get... Get Qaddafi!
[02:04:47.549 --> 02:04:47.850]  Get him!
[02:04:47.970 --> 02:04:48.290]  Get him!
[02:04:48.970 --> 02:04:49.350]  Okay?
[02:04:49.470 --> 02:04:51.171]  Wayne, it's wrong to talk bad.
[02:04:51.191 --> 02:04:52.631]  Al Qaeda's now our friend, okay?
[02:04:53.431 --> 02:04:54.292]  Obama said so.
[02:04:54.632 --> 02:04:56.272]  That's why they're changing their name.
[02:04:56.472 --> 02:04:56.732]  Yes.
[02:04:57.033 --> 02:04:58.073]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:04:59.935 --> 02:05:04.177]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:05:04.497 --> 02:05:05.097]  Number one.
[02:05:05.397 --> 02:05:08.558]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:08.818 --> 02:05:09.398]  Number two.
[02:05:09.678 --> 02:05:14.240]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:05:14.580 --> 02:05:15.020]  It's true.
[02:05:15.320 --> 02:05:19.881]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:20.181 --> 02:05:20.742]  Number three.
[02:05:21.022 --> 02:05:24.303]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:05:24.603 --> 02:05:28.304]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:05:28.504 --> 02:05:29.065]  Number 4.
[02:05:29.305 --> 02:05:31.667]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:05:32.067 --> 02:05:35.451]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:05:35.751 --> 02:05:35.951]  Number 5.
[02:05:36.532 --> 02:05:40.455]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:05:40.675 --> 02:05:45.440]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:05:45.720 --> 02:05:49.747]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:05:49.907 --> 02:05:51.469]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:05:51.690 --> 02:05:53.753]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[02:06:10.172 --> 02:06:14.258]  They haven't increased their prices on great long-term food reserves since last year.
[02:06:14.618 --> 02:06:19.805]  With the rising cost of raw materials and gas prices, they can't hold off any longer.
[02:06:20.465 --> 02:06:28.474]  As of July 1st, Ifu's Direct is forced to increase their prices so they can still ship you the best storable food on the planet.

[02:07:03.880 --> 02:07:04.781]  Tyranny is here.
[02:07:05.141 --> 02:07:08.844]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:07:09.004 --> 02:07:11.286]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:07:11.306 --> 02:07:16.750]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:07:17.170 --> 02:07:23.415]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:07:23.835 --> 02:07:29.357]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:07:29.778 --> 02:07:33.479]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:07:33.999 --> 02:07:37.981]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:07:38.261 --> 02:07:43.783]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:07:44.223 --> 02:07:47.345]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:07:47.765 --> 02:07:49.205]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:07:49.746 --> 02:07:50.186]  It's here.
[02:07:50.846 --> 02:07:57.872]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:08:00.534 --> 02:08:02.716]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:03.296 --> 02:08:06.099]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:29.483 --> 02:08:34.887]  Okay, we've got a lot of important news to cover this hour, and I'm going to cover the waterfront here.
[02:08:34.927 --> 02:08:38.170]  It just so happened that Tarpley's in Libya.
[02:08:39.110 --> 02:08:40.211]  Madsen just got back.
[02:08:40.251 --> 02:08:41.032]  This is heating up.
[02:08:41.412 --> 02:08:42.733]  Constitutional crisis.
[02:08:42.913 --> 02:08:44.955]  Al-Qaeda forces started the war.
[02:08:45.115 --> 02:08:46.696]  U.S., British, NATO backed.
[02:08:47.417 --> 02:08:49.759]  It's on record that Qaddafi financed Sarkozy.
[02:08:49.799 --> 02:08:54.762]  This is some weird double-cross with the big banks stealing the country's money.
[02:08:55.734 --> 02:08:57.135]  These are just such crooks.
[02:08:57.795 --> 02:08:59.396]  And I'm not a fan of Muammar Gaddafi.
[02:09:00.336 --> 02:09:03.718]  But compared to most people in the region, I mean, he's a schoolboy.
[02:09:05.059 --> 02:09:06.340]  And he is a military guy.
[02:09:06.840 --> 02:09:08.501]  And he's bought a lot of high-tech weapons.
[02:09:08.721 --> 02:09:12.002]  And they're waiting, quote, with the surprises under their hat.
[02:09:12.503 --> 02:09:16.425]  And their country's getting bombed for three-plus months with Western-backed al-Qaeda rebels.
[02:09:17.346 --> 02:09:18.507]  We're good to go.
[02:09:37.643 --> 02:09:39.925]  Of the top five Al-Qaeda guys, what, four of them?
[02:09:40.245 --> 02:09:44.209]  Born in the U.S., publicly protected, allowed to fly anywhere.
[02:09:44.609 --> 02:09:46.350]  Anytime a country arrests them, the U.S.
[02:09:46.390 --> 02:09:47.131]  goes and gets them out.
[02:09:47.972 --> 02:09:49.433]  I mean, it's very elementary.
[02:09:49.953 --> 02:09:53.316]  The Muslim extremists work for the bankers.
[02:09:53.917 --> 02:09:54.457]  Period.
[02:09:54.997 --> 02:09:56.999]  They don't want secular Western governments.
[02:09:57.039 --> 02:09:58.620]  They don't want to get along with the Arabs.
[02:09:58.961 --> 02:10:00.602]  They don't want to get along with Islam.
[02:10:00.962 --> 02:10:02.464]  They want to put radicals in.
[02:10:03.499 --> 02:10:04.160]  And they do it.
[02:10:04.921 --> 02:10:09.847]  And a lot of the radicals then go finance crazies who really do hate America and then attack us.
[02:10:10.208 --> 02:10:13.813]  And the bankers go, oh, we'll take your rights to keep you safe.
[02:10:13.893 --> 02:10:15.535]  I mean, it's so elementary.
[02:10:16.116 --> 02:10:17.517]  It's... Last night,
[02:10:18.666 --> 02:10:26.654]  I was in a store and I was talking to this guy and he goes, I like your show, but my buddy's in the FBI and he's worried about Muslims and Sharia law and all this stuff.
[02:10:26.674 --> 02:10:32.019]  And I'm like, well, if you're more, if you're concerned about more extreme forms of that, you better learn who finances it.
[02:10:32.039 --> 02:10:36.844]  And he goes, no, actually, my buddy in the FBI was talking about that too and doesn't know why the government does it.
[02:10:37.124 --> 02:10:38.526]  You don't know why the government does it.
[02:10:43.135 --> 02:10:54.945]  Because Muslim extremists are perfect to be handled by double agents and will go out and carry out heinous acts that are then used to take everybody's freedoms and invade these countries and take them over.
[02:10:55.445 --> 02:11:08.676]  The globalists use it as a skeleton key to take our rights and give trillions of dollars to the military-industrial complex in the name of protecting us and to go and invade all these countries and get trillions of dollars into that military black hole.
[02:11:12.805 --> 02:11:15.286]  It's called full-spectrum dominance.
[02:11:15.926 --> 02:11:25.410]  And if you're in full-spectrum dominance, you want to manipulate and control all sides, and then you sit outside of that paradigm, and then only you are left standing.
[02:11:26.190 --> 02:11:31.673]  I forget the James Bond movie that it was, but it was one of the early ones with Sean Connery.
[02:11:32.293 --> 02:11:33.013]  I've never seen it.
[02:11:33.834 --> 02:11:41.917]  It starts with an evil guy on some boat, and he's explaining to his agents in the group
[02:11:43.905 --> 02:11:46.628]  Chaos, or whatever the name, or Spectre, I forget what it was.
[02:11:46.648 --> 02:11:48.911]  Uh, Spectre's Get Smart, isn't it?
[02:11:48.951 --> 02:11:50.452]  It was, uh, I guess, Chaos.
[02:11:50.933 --> 02:11:51.373]  I forget.
[02:11:51.413 --> 02:11:53.956]  The point is, and he's got Chinese Fighting Fish.
[02:11:54.857 --> 02:11:56.039]  And there's three of them in there.
[02:11:57.182 --> 02:11:58.943]  And he goes, look at the smart one, it waits.
[02:11:59.043 --> 02:12:00.845]  And it waits till the other two fight.
[02:12:01.245 --> 02:12:02.606]  One's dead, the other's weakened.
[02:12:03.066 --> 02:12:07.229]  And then the smart one comes in and kills the weakened one.
[02:12:07.769 --> 02:12:09.150]  And he goes, that is what we will do.
[02:12:09.170 --> 02:12:10.671]  We'll play groups off against each other.
[02:12:11.011 --> 02:12:17.456]  And of course, those books that were made into films were written by one of the top people in MI6, formerly OSS.
[02:12:17.736 --> 02:12:20.217]  Let me give you a more modern day example of how this works.
[02:12:20.598 --> 02:12:21.098]  Please.
[02:12:21.678 --> 02:12:26.542]  And I remember the New York Times, the Washington Post, at the time that Revenge of the Sith came out,
[02:12:27.342 --> 02:12:28.543]  Cheesy Star Wars movies.
[02:12:29.284 --> 02:12:32.266]  But George Lucas, they were saying, what does the plot mean?
[02:12:32.286 --> 02:12:33.226]  We don't understand it.
[02:12:33.707 --> 02:12:35.288]  And he said, what do you mean you don't understand it?
[02:12:35.588 --> 02:12:37.529]  It's exactly what our government's doing today.
[02:12:38.110 --> 02:12:40.111]  Emperor Palpatine is George W. Bush.
[02:12:40.732 --> 02:12:42.213]  He said that at Cannes Film Festival.
[02:12:42.753 --> 02:12:51.279]  And I talked to so many adults who have such a blind spot, they couldn't understand the plot of a movie designed for 10-year-olds.
[02:12:52.620 --> 02:12:54.001]  Much of it almost unwatchable.
[02:12:54.441 --> 02:12:56.623]  I don't even like it, but I like the plot line.
[02:12:57.771 --> 02:13:00.812]  Okay, and folks, I might even go over the plot line.
[02:13:00.912 --> 02:13:06.974]  If adults can't figure out the plot line of a children's movie, of course you can't figure out what's happening today.
[02:13:07.414 --> 02:13:08.314]  Of course you can't.
[02:13:09.994 --> 02:13:15.236]  Okay, I've got a lot of key news to cover in the big TSA protest we're going to have at 4 o'clock today inside the Capitol.
[02:13:16.041 --> 02:13:17.982]  Or to be technical, we're going to go talk to our representatives.
[02:13:18.022 --> 02:13:19.243]  It's not even a protest.
[02:13:19.704 --> 02:13:21.005]  It's a citizen filibuster.
[02:13:21.185 --> 02:13:22.205]  And I'll explain that in a moment.
[02:13:23.086 --> 02:13:32.413]  So wherever you're listening in Texas, even if you're up in Dallas right now listening to us on five stations in the DFW area, get in your car, drive down, and I'll see you at the Texas Capitol at four o'clock.
[02:13:32.433 --> 02:13:34.234]  Or you get there at six o'clock, seven o'clock, so what?
[02:13:34.254 --> 02:13:36.296]  We're going to be there for three days, off and on.
[02:13:36.336 --> 02:13:38.157]  I'll be there for three days, off and on.
[02:13:38.297 --> 02:13:40.058]  You need to be there as well.
[02:13:40.399 --> 02:13:41.459]  Can't come today, come tomorrow.
[02:13:41.479 --> 02:13:45.042]  But four is when we really need you to have that good showing for the media.
[02:13:46.949 --> 02:13:50.590]  Let me just briefly explain Revenge of the Sith plotline.
[02:13:50.830 --> 02:13:55.212]  Because at the time we wrote articles about it because the media said we don't understand this.
[02:13:55.452 --> 02:13:57.652]  This makes no sense.
[02:13:58.733 --> 02:14:00.393]  The most popular of the three prequels.
[02:14:00.853 --> 02:14:01.694]  They made total sense.
[02:14:02.714 --> 02:14:07.696]  Emperor Palpatine was a little-known senator from Naboo, small planet.
[02:14:08.356 --> 02:14:11.577]  He finances terrorists to attack the planet.
[02:14:13.846 --> 02:14:27.358]  And then he plays victim and says that the pacifist republic isn't doing enough to help him with the terrorist invasion, the Trade Federation invasion, who even speak in Chinese accents.
[02:14:27.398 --> 02:14:28.419]  It's all geopolitical.
[02:14:29.019 --> 02:14:31.682]  And so, yeah, little aliens with Chinese accents.
[02:14:32.422 --> 02:14:39.529]  He then goes and complains and catapults himself in the crisis into the role of chancellor.
[02:14:40.589 --> 02:14:44.530]  Because, you know, he was the victim, but now he demanded something be done.
[02:14:44.570 --> 02:14:46.070]  He'd been a pacifist previously.
[02:14:46.390 --> 02:14:47.231]  Now he's Chancellor.
[02:14:47.531 --> 02:14:57.253]  Episode 2 launches terror attacks all over the galaxy with groups he's secretly financing through his backers in the Trade Federation.
[02:14:57.293 --> 02:14:58.814]  He turns around and double-crosses in the end.
[02:15:00.074 --> 02:15:03.735]  Lord Vader, Kill, Vice, Roy, Gunray, and everyone else in the...
[02:15:04.833 --> 02:15:08.796]  So basically, in the end, they knock out all of the people that backed them, which always happens.
[02:15:08.856 --> 02:15:13.460]  Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, Maoist China, learn from history.
[02:15:14.061 --> 02:15:19.325]  So he uses that to build up the power of the empire in episode two.
[02:15:20.446 --> 02:15:23.808]  And now he's got this big imperial army, but it's not imperial yet.
[02:15:24.229 --> 02:15:33.877]  But it's the stormtroopers, the outfits, the weapon systems to counter this outside threat run by Count Dooku, the Osama bin Laden guy that actually works for him, and they meet in secret.
[02:15:34.614 --> 02:15:41.065]  Now, in episode three, he launches an attack on the imperial capital himself.
[02:15:41.105 --> 02:15:42.527]  He launches an attack on New York.
[02:15:43.444 --> 02:15:51.647]  And then he gets captured, and then he sets up Count Dooku to get killed, and then he seduces to the dark side Anakin Skywalker to make him Darth Vader.
[02:15:52.347 --> 02:16:06.533]  And in the end, he then sets up, after he has the police state in place, he sets up the Jedi and says they're terrorists, and has the anti-terror forces go in and wipe them out, and then he says he's launching a global intergalactic war to bring peace.
[02:16:07.864 --> 02:16:11.146]  Now, the media could not understand.
[02:16:11.186 --> 02:16:11.446]  Wait.
[02:16:11.886 --> 02:16:12.766]  And they actually wrote articles.
[02:16:12.826 --> 02:16:14.707]  Emperor Palpatine's attacking himself?
[02:16:14.787 --> 02:16:15.688]  It makes no sense.
[02:16:16.968 --> 02:16:19.870]  Adults cannot understand children-level ideas.
[02:16:20.430 --> 02:16:20.730]  Okay?
[02:16:21.210 --> 02:16:22.851]  Child-level ideas.
[02:16:23.071 --> 02:16:24.612]  Child-level.
[02:16:24.992 --> 02:16:26.973]  Are we saying Count Dooku is good?
[02:16:27.173 --> 02:16:27.513]  No!
[02:16:27.533 --> 02:16:29.114]  We're not saying Bin Laden's good.
[02:16:30.253 --> 02:16:31.934]  Are we saying the Trade Federation's good?
[02:16:32.134 --> 02:16:32.434]  No!
[02:16:32.735 --> 02:16:33.675]  But they're being played.
[02:16:33.955 --> 02:16:40.980]  The globalists went and hired the Chinese in the 70s to be part of this larger deal to muscle out the industrial base of the West.
[02:16:41.060 --> 02:16:42.021]  They're going to be set up.
[02:16:42.801 --> 02:16:51.027]  And George Lucas, big insider, THX 1138 about digital high-tech tyrannies of the future.
[02:16:52.042 --> 02:16:53.503]  You know, one-child policies.
[02:16:54.883 --> 02:16:58.825]  He comes out and in like two paragraphs says, this is exactly what's happening today.
[02:16:59.245 --> 02:17:04.527]  I wrote this decades ago, but I rewrote it for what's happening in the world today.
[02:17:04.927 --> 02:17:08.108]  This movie is a allegory of what's really happening.
[02:17:08.869 --> 02:17:09.969]  How can you not understand it?
[02:17:11.910 --> 02:17:12.110]  Okay?
[02:17:13.731 --> 02:17:14.211]  Very simple.
[02:17:14.231 --> 02:17:15.871]  All right, I'm done.
[02:17:15.911 --> 02:17:16.932]  I've wasted a bunch of time.
[02:17:18.733 --> 02:17:19.473]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[02:17:21.519 --> 02:17:25.263]  The modern, slimy politician is all about deception.
[02:17:26.344 --> 02:17:30.508]  Obama tells you it's national free healthcare, we're gonna get the rich guys and give you money.
[02:17:30.868 --> 02:17:38.216]  Turns out it's written by the health insurance companies to make you buy it, lowers your standard of care, and exempts people with pre-existing conditions and is a total scam.
[02:17:39.237 --> 02:17:40.298]  And he exempts all his buddies.
[02:17:43.420 --> 02:17:48.502]  It's the same thing over and over and over again with what you're told something is for.
[02:17:49.502 --> 02:17:51.423]  The reason you're told something's being done.
[02:17:52.723 --> 02:17:55.284]  And we're seeing similar tricks today with Rick Perry.
[02:17:55.944 --> 02:17:59.425]  Rick Perry says it's a priority that this anti-groping bill passes.
[02:17:59.585 --> 02:18:00.706]  It passes unanimously.
[02:18:01.006 --> 02:18:04.687]  He has David Dewhurst, former CIA block op commander, kill the bill.
[02:18:04.927 --> 02:18:05.907]  Senators go public.
[02:18:06.148 --> 02:18:07.088]  Dewhurst is under heat.
[02:18:08.539 --> 02:18:12.781]  It's very politically unpopular what he did, so he says, OK, I'll put it in the special session of the governor will.
[02:18:12.801 --> 02:18:17.844]  The governor runs out the clock, says it can't pass, says nobody can add it, knowing full well he's the one that adds it.
[02:18:18.164 --> 02:18:19.905]  He gets caught with his pants down, adds it.
[02:18:20.246 --> 02:18:23.047]  Then they have the Speaker of the House kill it last Friday.
[02:18:23.467 --> 02:18:36.454]  Now they're bringing out a new, watered-down bill that's nothing more from what Representative David Simpson has said, and I've scanned over the bill, than a kind of glorified resolution.
[02:18:36.494 --> 02:18:37.115]  It does nothing.
[02:18:38.171 --> 02:18:46.272]  Now, regardless, the point is, this is a great example of the duplicitous type manipulation that we see.
[02:18:46.292 --> 02:18:54.534]  It's like George Bush said, I'm passing a law, trying to get Congress to pass a law to give you health freedom and to protect your medical records.
[02:18:54.854 --> 02:18:55.614]  Did the opposite.
[02:18:56.254 --> 02:18:57.974]  They call the Patriot Act the Patriot Act.
[02:18:57.994 --> 02:19:02.175]  They call a federal plan to drug half the kids in America, New Freedom Initiative.
[02:19:02.775 --> 02:19:03.915]  This is how they do it.
[02:19:05.136 --> 02:19:07.336]  So what is a citizen
[02:19:09.226 --> 02:19:09.846]  Filibuster.
[02:19:11.326 --> 02:19:23.469]  Depending on parliamentary rules in a House or Senate, federal, state, House members, Senate members can stand up and filibuster legislation they don't like and hold up an entire session to make sure a bill gets killed.
[02:19:23.489 --> 02:19:28.330]  And that's an emergency procedure in the state and federal constitutions to block really bad things.
[02:19:28.430 --> 02:19:32.371]  Well, what we're saying is, today, tomorrow, and the next day, we're doing a citizen's filibuster.
[02:19:32.671 --> 02:19:35.732]  We're going into their offices to talk to them and to tell them we want
[02:19:36.892 --> 02:19:47.801]  The members to go launch their own filibusters or to withdraw themselves from the votes, to talk to colleagues, to tie all this up so another special session has to get launched and announced after Wednesday.
[02:19:47.821 --> 02:19:49.603]  We're running the clock out on them here.
[02:19:50.303 --> 02:19:51.224]  They're trying to do that to us.
[02:19:51.264 --> 02:19:53.806]  Now we're going to reverse that and do that to them.
[02:19:54.046 --> 02:19:56.849]  This is a military tactic in legislation.
[02:19:56.949 --> 02:19:57.790]  Everything's military.
[02:19:58.090 --> 02:19:58.710]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:58.730 --> 02:19:59.131]  Stay with us.
[02:20:00.751 --> 02:20:03.672]  Forget everything you've been told about long-term food storage.
[02:20:03.953 --> 02:20:11.156]  When the collapse happens, you'll need the single most effective way to get high-powered Delta Force nutrients to your family, fast.
[02:20:12.037 --> 02:20:14.758]  Like any Special Forces commando, you need a plan.
[02:20:15.118 --> 02:20:17.379]  You need a Black Hawk Down food plan.
[02:20:17.659 --> 02:20:20.781]  Introducing the Survival Sprout Bank from Solutions from Science.
[02:20:21.081 --> 02:20:22.841]  It's your countertop survival garden.
[02:20:23.101 --> 02:20:27.342]  Yes, grow fresh greens right on your countertop in just a few short days.
[02:20:27.682 --> 02:20:34.504]  Sprouts are the green shoots that emerge from newly germinated seeds, and they are powerhouses of living, easily absorbed nutrients.
[02:20:34.744 --> 02:20:38.145]  The Survival Sprout Bank is a complete kit with nothing else to buy.
[02:20:38.345 --> 02:20:42.646]  And with sprouts so easy to grow, even children can grow emergency food.

[02:21:00.839 --> 02:21:04.481]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:21:04.861 --> 02:21:07.862]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:21:08.102 --> 02:21:12.864]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:21:12.884 --> 02:21:19.127]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:21:19.287 --> 02:21:21.528]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:21:22.068 --> 02:21:22.348]  Tim Geithner?
[02:21:22.368 --> 02:21:22.608]  Bernanke?
[02:21:22.628 --> 02:21:23.168]  They're arsonists!
[02:21:23.189 --> 02:21:23.969]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:21:23.989 --> 02:21:25.630]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:21:40.956 --> 02:21:47.903]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.

[02:22:29.560 --> 02:22:34.105]  235 years ago our forefathers signed the Declaration of Independence to escape tyranny and oppression.
[02:22:34.265 --> 02:22:36.728]  Today there is a need to reinforce that declaration.
[02:22:36.828 --> 02:22:43.336]  What can we do to protect our health as a nation and in our homes from those who wish to control the quality of our air and water?

[02:23:09.184 --> 02:23:12.407]  Traditional metal lids are single-use throwaways containing BPA.
[02:23:12.667 --> 02:23:17.470]  But Tadler Reusable Canning Lids are guaranteed to last a lifetime when used as design for home canning.
[02:23:17.670 --> 02:23:24.395]  Tadler Lids are made with a USDA and FDA approved food grade plastic, safe for direct food contact, and contain no BPA.

[02:23:41.287 --> 02:23:42.228]  The original since 1976.
[02:24:00.165 --> 02:24:00.906]  We're good.
[02:24:14.321 --> 02:24:15.502]  Here's some interesting news.
[02:24:15.722 --> 02:24:16.822]  This is out of CNN money.
[02:24:17.803 --> 02:24:21.865]  Ex-City Group Vice President charged with $19 million fraud.
[02:24:22.985 --> 02:24:24.306]  And I've been predicting this would happen.
[02:24:24.326 --> 02:24:28.388]  They're going to burn some vice presidents and people and have big show trials on TV.
[02:24:28.408 --> 02:24:34.952]  They've already had congressional hearings on, you know, smaller Timberwolf stuff done by Goldman Sachs and others.
[02:24:34.992 --> 02:24:37.393]  And they'll burn some low-level people for $19 million.
[02:24:38.093 --> 02:24:43.196]  But if you launder $376 billion and you're Wachovia and Wells Fargo, no problem.
[02:24:44.488 --> 02:24:47.135]  Or you steal tens of trillions and take it offshore, no problem.
[02:24:48.398 --> 02:24:50.743]  But, Gary Foster, a former Citigroup executive...
[02:24:51.772 --> 02:24:54.773]  I mean, vice presidents of these companies are a dime a dozen.
[02:24:55.174 --> 02:24:58.735]  Was arrested Monday on charges he embezzled more than $19 million from the bank.
[02:24:59.295 --> 02:25:01.336]  So he's being arrested for stealing from the bankers.
[02:25:02.097 --> 02:25:06.618]  And he's going to go to the wall, but it'll also be paraded as if he did everything.
[02:25:06.639 --> 02:25:16.683]  According to criminal complaint, unsealed in New York, Foster allegedly transferred millions of dollars from various Citigroup accounts into his personal account at JPMorgan Chase on eight separate occasions.
[02:25:16.723 --> 02:25:18.244]  Well, I mean, you hired him to do that.
[02:25:18.304 --> 02:25:18.904]  I mean, come on.
[02:25:20.848 --> 02:25:26.271]  Foster 35 is accused of using fraudulent contracts and deal numbers to mask the transfers.
[02:25:26.911 --> 02:25:30.233]  I mean, Bank of America takes houses that are paid for that they don't even have a deed to.
[02:25:30.253 --> 02:25:31.454]  I mean, why not?
[02:25:32.014 --> 02:25:32.794]  Oh, but I understand.
[02:25:32.834 --> 02:25:36.716]  It's okay when it's done to us or veterans have their death benefits taken by big banks.
[02:25:37.116 --> 02:25:37.817]  That's good.
[02:25:38.337 --> 02:25:41.179]  But you don't... See, when I was first given the article, I thought, oh, they charged somebody.
[02:25:41.379 --> 02:25:42.960]  Oh, he stole from the banks.
[02:25:43.040 --> 02:25:43.540]  I'm sorry.
[02:25:43.820 --> 02:25:45.401]  He stole from Al Capone.
[02:25:46.121 --> 02:25:47.302]  And you don't do that.
[02:25:48.570 --> 02:25:51.135]  Now I want to specifically, when we come back, open the phones up.
[02:25:52.250 --> 02:25:58.254]  And I want to hear if you're outraged by the unanimous vote, and then they killed it in the Texas House, the whole country watching.
[02:25:59.034 --> 02:26:00.936]  They kill it in the Senate, then they bring it back.
[02:26:01.316 --> 02:26:03.317]  Perry says he can't put it on the session.
[02:26:03.698 --> 02:26:04.678]  Folks know that he can.
[02:26:04.738 --> 02:26:05.559]  We force him to.
[02:26:05.939 --> 02:26:11.162]  He waits till the end, and then they have the Speaker of the House come out and badmouth the bill, saying, oh, it's a stunt.
[02:26:11.243 --> 02:26:11.523]  Oh, really?
[02:26:11.543 --> 02:26:12.123]  I've read the bill.
[02:26:12.443 --> 02:26:19.908]  The Attorney General signed off on it in Texas, said, yeah, it's official oppression to just come up and randomly stick your hands down people's pants or squeeze their genitals.
[02:26:20.148 --> 02:26:20.769]  You can't do that.
[02:26:22.162 --> 02:26:26.185]  And now the Speaker comes out and says, it's a bad thing.
[02:26:26.925 --> 02:26:27.946]  Nope, this is bad.
[02:26:29.027 --> 02:26:31.348]  And it's not our job at the state to do this, it's the Fed's.
[02:26:31.628 --> 02:26:32.709]  Well, why even have a state?
[02:26:32.989 --> 02:26:34.951]  Why even have a Speaker of the House in Texas?
[02:26:35.231 --> 02:26:36.111]  Why even have you?
[02:26:36.732 --> 02:26:40.674]  Because you're already violating the rules and blocking it last Friday.
[02:26:40.714 --> 02:26:44.737]  And now they reportedly are set to vote on some facsimile whitewash.
[02:26:44.797 --> 02:26:47.339]  And David Simpson and his lawyers have gone over it.
[02:26:47.799 --> 02:26:51.562]  And they put out a press release this morning saying they are withdrawing support for that bill.
[02:26:52.022 --> 02:26:52.302]  Simple.
[02:26:53.803 --> 02:26:54.703]  And it's up to you, folks.
[02:26:54.723 --> 02:26:57.725]  If you're listening to my voice, you must go down there.
[02:26:58.005 --> 02:26:59.146]  I got a lot of stuff I want to do.
[02:26:59.506 --> 02:27:04.769]  You think I particularly want to see all those lobbyists in their suits and deal with it all?
[02:27:04.869 --> 02:27:05.069]  No.
[02:27:05.349 --> 02:27:06.790]  But once I get down there, I'm going to have fun.
[02:27:07.110 --> 02:27:08.591]  Just go down there and you'll have a good time.
[02:27:09.591 --> 02:27:12.573]  Texas is to launch Citizen Filler Buster over TSA.
[02:27:13.033 --> 02:27:16.935]  And in two and a half hours, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to roll up and I'm going to go in.
[02:27:16.955 --> 02:27:18.896]  And you can meet me in there under the dome.
[02:27:18.916 --> 02:27:19.836]  I think that's a good spot.
[02:27:19.856 --> 02:27:20.597]  If you get there early,
[02:27:21.417 --> 02:27:26.403]  Uh, you know, if you want, go in under the dome, or if you want to sit out in the heat, under the steps and, you know, wait, whatever.
[02:27:26.823 --> 02:27:32.089]  And we'll all get together and we'll all go find the media first to explain to them what's really happening.
[02:27:32.570 --> 02:27:35.433]  And then we'll march over to the House and Senate.
[02:27:36.694 --> 02:27:43.217]  And let them know what we think, and we'll then go to individual members, offices of citizens and talk to our public servants.
[02:27:43.698 --> 02:27:47.420]  Not our officials, not our authorities, not our masters, not our owners.
[02:27:47.460 --> 02:27:50.641]  I love it when I hear state reps call us civilians and cops do.
[02:27:50.901 --> 02:27:52.062]  You're all civilians too.
[02:27:52.502 --> 02:27:55.924]  We're not in some globalist occupied system, even though that's what you're setting up.
[02:27:56.204 --> 02:27:58.185]  You should know what those terms really stand for.
[02:27:58.225 --> 02:28:00.566]  Now, I want to hear from listeners.
[02:28:00.726 --> 02:28:02.127]  A, what's your view on all this?
[02:28:02.187 --> 02:28:04.068]  And B, are you going to be with me down there?
[02:28:06.360 --> 02:28:10.382]  At the Texas State Capitol, off 11th Street and Congress today.
[02:28:10.582 --> 02:28:12.003]  Are you going to be there at 4 o'clock?
[02:28:12.303 --> 02:28:14.984]  And if you can't make it then, come at 5, come at 6, come at 7, come at 8.
[02:28:15.484 --> 02:28:16.945]  But it's important if you can, be there at 4.
[02:28:17.965 --> 02:28:19.746]  And then I'll be there a few hours, then I'll leave.
[02:28:20.286 --> 02:28:23.428]  And then you can be there until late in the night, you can show up at 10 if you want, it's still going to be going.
[02:28:23.748 --> 02:28:30.791]  And we are going to inject real issues and a citizen filibuster, going to their offices and talking to them, and tell them, hey,
[02:28:32.082 --> 02:28:33.222]  You don't like being buffaloed?
[02:28:33.242 --> 02:28:34.243]  You don't like being run over?
[02:28:34.303 --> 02:28:42.666]  You don't like the House Speaker and the Senate Leader and others behind the scenes when they claim they supported it now, 180, and being honest and killing it?
[02:28:42.906 --> 02:28:47.768]  You know, being honest about the fact that they're traitors against state sovereignty, the Fourth Amendment and Tenth Amendment and Ninth Amendment?
[02:28:48.389 --> 02:28:50.629]  Then don't go vote on any of these votes.
[02:28:50.770 --> 02:28:51.390]  Abstain.
[02:28:52.050 --> 02:28:53.191]  Go get your other colleagues.
[02:28:55.390 --> 02:28:56.210]  To filibuster.
[02:28:56.510 --> 02:28:57.511]  Get up, even if you can't.
[02:28:57.671 --> 02:28:59.651]  Some of them, because I forget the entire House rules.
[02:29:00.071 --> 02:29:04.773]  Every state's different, but I know some filibusters are allowed by senior members, definitely of the Senate.
[02:29:05.033 --> 02:29:07.894]  Guys, will you pull up Texas filibustering rules for me, please?
[02:29:09.854 --> 02:29:12.035]  Texas filibustering rules.
[02:29:12.535 --> 02:29:14.776]  We're going to pull that up during the break so I can check that.
[02:29:14.796 --> 02:29:21.058]  But the point is, even if you can't filibuster, they can do technical filibusters where members talk about each bill.
[02:29:22.112 --> 02:29:26.897]  And spend time on all the bills and just hang the whole thing up.
[02:29:27.398 --> 02:29:29.380]  And this is an American institution to do this.
[02:29:29.720 --> 02:29:31.742]  We're gonna go lobby for them to filibuster.
[02:29:32.043 --> 02:29:33.744]  Lobby for them to bring up technical points.
[02:29:34.065 --> 02:29:36.487]  That's what I'm dubbing a citizen filibuster.
[02:29:37.208 --> 02:29:41.092]  We don't just have the jury box, the grand jury box, or the voting box.
[02:29:41.893 --> 02:29:50.343]  We also have the pamphlets, the press, and we have the power of the citizen filibuster that's really just lobbying politicians at point-blank range.
[02:29:50.423 --> 02:29:51.284]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.784 --> 02:29:53.386]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.327 --> 02:29:57.010]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.489 --> 02:30:05.913]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:30:07.153 --> 02:30:11.957]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:30:12.297 --> 02:30:19.321]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:30:21.023 --> 02:30:23.204]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:30:25.085 --> 02:30:27.447]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:30:39.165 --> 02:30:41.046]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:30:41.306 --> 02:30:42.806]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:30:43.086 --> 02:30:45.647]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:30:45.987 --> 02:30:52.228]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:30:52.608 --> 02:30:54.829]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:30:55.309 --> 02:30:56.729]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:30:56.889 --> 02:30:57.330]  Got it.
[02:30:57.670 --> 02:30:58.530]  Others don't.
[02:30:59.718 --> 02:31:03.961]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:04.282 --> 02:31:04.562]  Number 1.
[02:31:05.182 --> 02:31:08.345]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:08.605 --> 02:31:09.165]  Number 2.
[02:31:09.486 --> 02:31:14.029]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:14.369 --> 02:31:14.810]  It's true.
[02:31:15.110 --> 02:31:19.673]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:19.994 --> 02:31:20.514]  Number 3.
[02:31:20.814 --> 02:31:24.097]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:24.397 --> 02:31:28.100]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:28.300 --> 02:31:28.841]  Number 4.
[02:31:29.081 --> 02:31:31.463]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:31.863 --> 02:31:35.246]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:35.526 --> 02:31:35.747]  Number 5.
[02:31:36.327 --> 02:31:40.250]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:31:40.471 --> 02:31:45.235]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:31:45.515 --> 02:31:49.541]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:49.681 --> 02:31:51.243]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:51.484 --> 02:31:53.547]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:31:53.727 --> 02:31:56.090]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:32:00.612 --> 02:32:02.093]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:32:02.313 --> 02:32:07.355]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:32:07.615 --> 02:32:08.995]  Saving means to make money.
[02:32:09.155 --> 02:32:17.939]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:32:18.679 --> 02:32:25.782]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:32:26.222 --> 02:32:33.825]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:32:34.225 --> 02:32:39.147]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[02:32:39.447 --> 02:32:41.608]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[02:32:49.798 --> 02:32:51.200]  Or see Calvin on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[02:33:07.677 --> 02:33:15.366]  The toll-free number to join us on air to give us your view on the TSA tyranny nationwide and what's happening in Texas.
[02:33:15.386 --> 02:33:16.347]  The Skullduggery.
[02:33:17.188 --> 02:33:19.430]  The Scallywaggery by Rick Perry.
[02:33:23.345 --> 02:33:26.108]  Total free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[02:33:26.128 --> 02:33:26.689]  800-259-9231.
[02:33:26.809 --> 02:33:34.977]  I may even do a little bit of overdrive coming up into the next hour just because I have to.
[02:33:34.997 --> 02:33:36.799]  I'm going to be down there at 4 o'clock.
[02:33:38.461 --> 02:33:40.363]  And I was correct from memory.
[02:33:40.383 --> 02:33:42.666]  It's the Texas Senate can do a filibuster.
[02:33:44.301 --> 02:33:48.063]  Technically, House members can speak on rules or on a point for quite a long time.
[02:33:48.423 --> 02:33:57.207]  The national record, either federal or state, is held by Senator Bill Miller, state senator for the state of Texas.
[02:33:57.227 --> 02:33:58.788]  He has the national record as well.
[02:33:58.808 --> 02:34:01.229]  43-hour filibuster on SB 1275 during the 65th regular session in 1977.
[02:34:11.237 --> 02:34:20.362]  It's Meyer objected to the provision of the bill which would have prevented public inspection of the records of an industrial accident.
[02:34:21.543 --> 02:34:22.003]  That's good.
[02:34:22.123 --> 02:34:23.564]  That was to have sunshine on things.
[02:34:24.204 --> 02:34:29.867]  Senator Bill Meyer, I've said that wrong three times now or twice, was the longest filibuster.
[02:34:30.328 --> 02:34:33.910]  A filibuster is a prolonged discussion of a bill.
[02:34:34.929 --> 02:34:38.797]  ...by an individual intended to delay legislative action or filibusters allowed in the state of Texas.
[02:34:39.499 --> 02:34:42.505]  Filibusters are permitted in the Senate, but not in the House of Representatives.
[02:34:42.525 --> 02:34:45.892]  Filibusters are governed by the Senate rules and by precedents.
[02:34:46.949 --> 02:34:47.810]  Interpreting the rules.
[02:34:49.071 --> 02:34:52.193]  And it requires a member to stand at their desk.
[02:34:52.713 --> 02:34:56.316]  The member speaking may not sit, lean, or use the desk or chair in any way.
[02:34:56.696 --> 02:34:58.177]  Bathroom breaks are not allowed.
[02:34:58.538 --> 02:35:02.020]  Man, I could do a filibuster, but not more than 24 hours.
[02:35:02.040 --> 02:35:02.681]  Can you imagine?
[02:35:02.701 --> 02:35:03.782]  43 hour filibuster.
[02:35:07.612 --> 02:35:11.873]  43 hours standing up and non-stop talking.
[02:35:12.473 --> 02:35:14.273]  You think I can talk, ladies and gentlemen?
[02:35:14.293 --> 02:35:18.734]  In fact, this three-hour show, a lot of times, is nothing but a ranting filibuster against tyranny.
[02:35:19.614 --> 02:35:21.214]  I can imagine 43 hours.
[02:35:22.135 --> 02:35:26.955]  I did off and on, you know, for 27 hours for that money bomb we did, and that was nothing.
[02:35:27.335 --> 02:35:27.856]  I'm a wimp.
[02:35:30.616 --> 02:35:30.916]  That's it.
[02:35:30.956 --> 02:35:34.297]  I gotta do a 24-hour radio show and do non-stop without commercials.
[02:35:34.657 --> 02:35:35.717]  I feel pathetic.
[02:35:36.601 --> 02:35:39.885]  But hey, I'm proud a Texan has the record in the United States.
[02:35:40.325 --> 02:35:41.347]  So we're going down there.
[02:35:41.747 --> 02:35:49.796]  I mean, our ancestors could stand there for 40-something hours, non-stop, not eating, not drinking, not going to the bathroom for freedom.
[02:35:50.197 --> 02:35:52.740]  Can you get in your car and drive down there in two and a half hours?
[02:35:52.800 --> 02:35:53.360]  Can you go?
[02:35:53.601 --> 02:35:55.223]  Will you go talk to your representatives?
[02:35:57.079 --> 02:35:59.421]  It was very effective last time, we got it back on.
[02:35:59.761 --> 02:36:02.262]  Now they've engaged in more sneakiness to get it back off.
[02:36:02.783 --> 02:36:04.724]  But it shows how desperate they are.
[02:36:04.784 --> 02:36:14.950]  The feds know if states start standing up, if states start exercising their power, especially a big, prominent state, as go Texas, goes the rest of the nation, the globalists will start losing.
[02:36:15.631 --> 02:36:21.154]  They have to keep up this arrogant, con-artist idea of infallibility and invincibility.
[02:36:21.455 --> 02:36:22.155]  They are not.
[02:36:22.976 --> 02:36:24.657]  I want to see you down there.
[02:36:26.351 --> 02:36:26.591]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:36:26.711 --> 02:36:29.893]  We'll take some calls.
[02:36:29.933 --> 02:36:35.195]  And I've got some other incredible news on Big Brother federal spies snooping.
[02:36:35.715 --> 02:36:40.978]  New Obama program sending out snoopers to pose as patients so they can check up on doctors.
[02:36:42.538 --> 02:36:43.519]  Well, they might be Al Qaeda.
[02:36:44.519 --> 02:36:46.620]  Also, the euro collapsing.
[02:36:47.340 --> 02:36:51.062]  I talked about this briefly yesterday, but I do got to talk sometime about
[02:36:52.705 --> 02:36:54.185]  The Star-Spangled Banner being booed.
[02:36:54.926 --> 02:37:00.287]  Eighty-plus percent of the people in the stadium for the Mexican team in California, Southern California.
[02:37:01.227 --> 02:37:04.328]  And booing the American team pretty much constantly.
[02:37:04.368 --> 02:37:06.849]  And that happens in some games, but not at this level.
[02:37:07.409 --> 02:37:09.350]  And certainly not during a national anthem.
[02:37:10.190 --> 02:37:12.310]  And I interviewed the folks in the L.A.
[02:37:12.330 --> 02:37:16.592]  Times and I said, well, I live here in the U.S., but I'm for Mexico.
[02:37:16.912 --> 02:37:17.992]  And see, that's the issue.
[02:37:19.252 --> 02:37:20.613]  That's the problem with identity.
[02:37:23.103 --> 02:37:25.647]  Can't even wear American flags now in many high schools in America.
[02:37:26.328 --> 02:37:27.190]  That is not allowed.
[02:37:28.311 --> 02:37:30.335]  That's political correctness, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:37:31.597 --> 02:37:34.842]  And it just shows what the globalists are doing to this country.
[02:37:35.804 --> 02:37:36.905]  But if you just joined us...
[02:37:37.958 --> 02:37:44.902]  Rick Perry had David Dewhurst kill the bill when it unanimously passed the House, and they had a near-unanimous in the Senate, one vote against.
[02:37:45.403 --> 02:37:47.824]  He killed it, wouldn't let it come to a vote, but they had the votes lined up.
[02:37:48.324 --> 02:37:49.485]  Then tried to cover up, he did it.
[02:37:49.525 --> 02:37:50.986]  Then under pressure, he added it.
[02:37:51.526 --> 02:37:53.328]  Perry added it right at the last minute.
[02:37:54.229 --> 02:38:01.512]  They held it up to a vote on Friday, and then the House Speaker came out, who'd voted for it previously, and said, I'm not going to let this come to a vote now.
[02:38:02.933 --> 02:38:04.714]  They don't want this conversation with the feds.
[02:38:05.234 --> 02:38:07.035]  Perry's getting ready to move up to the federal level.
[02:38:07.055 --> 02:38:08.355]  They're getting ready to run him for president.
[02:38:08.816 --> 02:38:11.857]  He doesn't want another special session because he's pledged not to run for president.
[02:38:12.637 --> 02:38:15.839]  Then he said, well, I'm going to break my pledge maybe, but I'll wait till the session's over.
[02:38:16.159 --> 02:38:17.900]  He does not want another legislative session.
[02:38:19.082 --> 02:38:35.659]  And so we say, okay, you ran the clock out on us, we're going to go down there and ask other members of the Senate, go to Senators' offices and say, we want filibusters on other bills that you already don't agree with to hold up the entire session, because the globalists want a bunch of these bills through, so they have to have a whole nother session.
[02:38:36.179 --> 02:38:37.401]  See how Rick Perry likes that.
[02:38:38.450 --> 02:38:42.514]  This is a reverse of their stalling tactic.
[02:38:42.534 --> 02:38:50.520]  Now we're going to stall them with a citizen filibuster that's citizens lobbying for a filibuster and lobbying at point-blank range inside a Capitol.
[02:38:50.781 --> 02:38:51.902]  I've now defined it.
[02:38:52.082 --> 02:38:53.503]  Guaranteed it's going to be a new favorite.
[02:38:55.204 --> 02:38:58.027]  Okay, let's go ahead and... That was like a George Bush laugh.
[02:39:00.209 --> 02:39:04.472]  Let's go ahead and talk to Travis in Texas.
[02:39:04.793 --> 02:39:06.134]  Travis, you're on the air, my friend.
[02:39:07.062 --> 02:39:08.645]  Hey, Jeff Jones, how's it going today?
[02:39:09.186 --> 02:39:11.271]  Oh, I gotta go down there and face the scum again!
[02:39:12.099 --> 02:39:13.339]  Well, that's what I was calling about.
[02:39:13.379 --> 02:39:14.339]  I'm a little bit frustrated.
[02:39:14.359 --> 02:39:24.321]  I went up there at 8 o'clock this morning and told them I was in support of the bill and now I'm hearing that it's completely changed and it's not even in the best interest of what we're looking to do here.
[02:39:24.361 --> 02:39:25.101]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:39:25.141 --> 02:39:28.762]  We need to support the original bill that Simpson wrote.
[02:39:29.022 --> 02:39:29.782]  Well, there's been two.
[02:39:30.102 --> 02:39:31.802]  The second version, I've read it, it's good.
[02:39:32.162 --> 02:39:34.923]  The new one, Simpson's on record and we've gone over the bill.
[02:39:35.583 --> 02:39:40.204]  TSA tyranny withdraws support from House version of TSA anti-groping bill.
[02:39:40.244 --> 02:39:40.944]  Now, they're saying
[02:39:41.644 --> 02:39:43.226]  That it may have been added back in.
[02:39:43.247 --> 02:39:43.887]  We're not sure.
[02:39:44.148 --> 02:39:46.632]  We're going down there to investigate what's going on.
[02:39:46.912 --> 02:39:47.933]  We're going to get answers.
[02:39:47.954 --> 02:39:49.476]  They're going to try little tricks and things.
[02:39:49.876 --> 02:39:51.559]  And we're going to find out what's going on.
[02:39:51.799 --> 02:39:54.063]  We're going down there to find out what's happening.
[02:39:54.841 --> 02:39:55.682]  That's great, man.
[02:39:55.722 --> 02:39:57.204]  I wish I could meet you down there at 4.
[02:39:57.244 --> 02:40:03.492]  I got the pleasure of sharing a little slave box with you last time when we went to the checkpoint pretty much at the same time.
[02:40:03.873 --> 02:40:04.914]  Absolutely.
[02:40:05.375 --> 02:40:06.756]  Anyway, I'd love to be there again.
[02:40:06.777 --> 02:40:11.523]  I'm not going to be able to be there at 4, but if anybody is listening to this, you need to get down there and stand up for your freedom.
[02:40:12.247 --> 02:40:28.498]  Well, I'm seeing headlines like Texas Governor Rick Perry revives TSA bill, LA Times, blog critics, Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Amarillo TV, literally 696 articles about how he is fighting the TSA.
[02:40:28.779 --> 02:40:30.360]  He's the one killing it!
[02:40:31.772 --> 02:40:37.074]  Think of that level of deception, folks, the sneakiness of Al Gore's former campaign chairman.
[02:40:37.274 --> 02:40:39.255]  Oh, you didn't know that?
[02:40:39.355 --> 02:40:46.917]  That he tried to keep it off, then when it passed, he killed it, then he put it back on because of pressure, and then had it killed again through his minions.
[02:40:47.217 --> 02:40:48.498]  Disgusting.
[02:40:48.938 --> 02:40:52.159]  And now, state rep, who'd been trying to be friendly with Perry,
[02:40:53.299 --> 02:40:55.360]  David Simpson has had to admit that that's what's going on.
[02:40:55.660 --> 02:40:56.780]  But things are changing.
[02:40:56.800 --> 02:40:57.940]  We're going to put pressure on them.
[02:40:58.480 --> 02:40:59.761]  We're going to get down there today.
[02:40:59.981 --> 02:41:01.201]  Everybody needs to be there.
[02:41:01.441 --> 02:41:03.141]  And then again tomorrow and the next day.
[02:41:03.742 --> 02:41:09.543]  Because even if they pass something good today, it's got to have multiple readings and they've got to force this to the front.
[02:41:09.803 --> 02:41:12.364]  We're going to end up making them have another special session.
[02:41:12.944 --> 02:41:15.344]  We're going to exert our will on them.
[02:41:15.364 --> 02:41:16.265]  OK?
[02:41:16.525 --> 02:41:17.185]  We're going to do it!
[02:41:18.845 --> 02:41:19.885]  Let's continue here.
[02:41:20.045 --> 02:41:21.266]  Let's talk to Frank in Texas.
[02:41:21.286 --> 02:41:22.166]  You're on the air, Frank.
[02:41:23.700 --> 02:41:25.582]  Hey, I'm Frank in Texas.
[02:41:25.742 --> 02:41:27.143]  Long time listener.
[02:41:27.764 --> 02:41:31.868]  I don't have anything specifically on the Texas vote today, so I'm not going to take up all your time.
[02:41:32.348 --> 02:41:38.254]  But if there's anything that I could tell your listeners, you know, a lot of people say, well, you know, find out, you know, what does it matter if we know this stuff?
[02:41:38.274 --> 02:41:38.855]  What can we do?
[02:41:39.075 --> 02:41:40.777]  You can go get involved in your community.
[02:41:41.197 --> 02:41:43.139]  I'm only 22 years old, and I'm a member of
[02:41:43.999 --> 02:41:44.619]  That's interesting.
[02:41:44.639 --> 02:41:46.180]  Just send it to ShowTipsAtInfoWars.com.
[02:41:46.280 --> 02:41:46.580]  Listen, folks.
[02:42:14.574 --> 02:42:17.215]  You all need to come down there and join me today.
[02:42:17.956 --> 02:42:19.596]  We need more people than we had last time.
[02:42:19.636 --> 02:42:28.781]  We need to go into the Capitol, or even if you want to meet me once I go in, whatever, just get down there, go and talk to your senators, find out exactly what's going on.
[02:42:29.741 --> 02:42:39.226]  We need to get Senator Patrick, if this isn't the bill that he supports, we need to have him filibuster and hold the whole process up.
[02:42:39.386 --> 02:42:43.648]  We need to build our liberty muscles by getting involved, get down there.
[02:42:44.108 --> 02:42:45.689]  Catherine in New York, you're on the air.
[02:42:46.749 --> 02:42:50.831]  Hey Alex, I met you at the Talkers Conference here in New York.
[02:42:51.792 --> 02:42:58.435]  I just wanted to call and say, I mean, I literally have been saying what you have been saying.
[02:42:59.520 --> 02:43:01.121]  For my entire life.
[02:43:01.321 --> 02:43:12.926]  I mean, one thing, I don't hear it brought up too much on your show, but I just feel like it's, you know, it's always like the family and there's so much abuse that goes on in families.
[02:43:13.678 --> 02:43:19.343]  And I tried to, you know, kind of like wake people up to this, you know, for my entire life.
[02:43:19.403 --> 02:43:22.105]  I mean, we are taught this stuff at home.
[02:43:22.165 --> 02:43:25.969]  We're taught this stuff in families, to bow down to the system.
[02:43:26.529 --> 02:43:31.613]  You know, we learn to, you know, hit the canvas, like, so to speak, like you said.
[02:43:31.633 --> 02:43:38.019]  No, Americans have not been free for a long time, and licking the boots of government is the opposite of what this country was all about.
[02:43:40.566 --> 02:43:42.469]  I literally have been saying it all my life.
[02:43:43.030 --> 02:43:45.553]  People, you know, like no one listens to you.
[02:43:45.573 --> 02:43:48.297]  It's like, you know, they just totally ignore you.
[02:43:48.317 --> 02:43:50.680]  Well, I have the opposite happening, Catherine.
[02:43:50.700 --> 02:43:52.783]  It was good to meet you there at Talkers.
[02:43:52.823 --> 02:43:56.288]  But listen, folks, I opened the phones up about specifically
[02:43:57.029 --> 02:43:58.950]  about the TSA and all of this.
[02:43:59.371 --> 02:44:07.636]  Think about how outrageous that is, that Perry continues to say he's for it, then quietly kills it in the Senate, then he said, oh, I can't reintroduce it.
[02:44:08.057 --> 02:44:09.217]  It comes out he's a liar.
[02:44:09.838 --> 02:44:17.163]  He puts it back on, then has the leader of the House kill it and badmouth a bill that he voted for a month ago.
[02:44:18.240 --> 02:44:23.202]  And then now they've got some resolution watered down and David Simpson says he's removing his support for it.
[02:44:23.502 --> 02:44:25.063]  Get down to the Capitol now!
[02:44:25.863 --> 02:44:26.463]  Get down there.
[02:44:26.503 --> 02:44:27.684]  I'll be there at four o'clock.
[02:44:28.464 --> 02:44:28.844]  Send it out.
[02:44:28.884 --> 02:44:31.165]  In fact, I got so busy today I never even sent it out on my Twitter.
[02:44:31.826 --> 02:44:33.747]  I'll try to do that right now or during a break.
[02:44:37.548 --> 02:44:38.869]  Kenny in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:44:38.909 --> 02:44:39.289]  Go ahead.
[02:44:39.309 --> 02:44:42.750]  Hey Alex, it's an honor.
[02:44:42.830 --> 02:44:46.432]  I'm an 80% disabled vet and I've been listening to you for about four years now.
[02:44:47.481 --> 02:44:51.523]  A day without the truth is like a day without sunshine, and we appreciate everything you do.
[02:44:53.644 --> 02:45:06.029]  There's a thing on YouTube called Martin Luther King, why I oppose the war in Vietnam, and he quoted Dante and said, the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who, in a time of moral crisis, maintain their neutrality.
[02:45:06.410 --> 02:45:08.170]  I want to grab people and just shake them, Alex.
[02:45:08.250 --> 02:45:09.491]  It's time to wake up, man.
[02:45:09.991 --> 02:45:13.613]  And you read my prayers, and give them hell down there at the courthouse.
[02:45:14.144 --> 02:45:14.805]  Well, thank you, sir.
[02:45:14.865 --> 02:45:19.910]  What's your view on... I mean, this is even more evil than Bill Clinton.
[02:45:19.930 --> 02:45:24.314]  Bill Clinton would lie about a bill he didn't like to get it killed.
[02:45:24.635 --> 02:45:33.343]  Perry actually gets bills introduced, like sanctuary city bans and other things, because he knows in 05 he got an award from Fox for
[02:45:34.164 --> 02:45:42.329]  We're at a crossroads here, and it's like Ron Paul said, if we'll let them stick their hands down our children's pants, then we're at a crossroads here, brother.
[02:45:59.222 --> 02:46:07.809]  And it's time to wake up and get out on your knees and start talking to the man upstairs, and he will make things happen because of people like you.
[02:46:08.349 --> 02:46:09.930]  And I'll make copies of your DVDs.
[02:46:10.031 --> 02:46:12.593]  I just got me an InfoWars t-shirt, and I'm proud of it, buddy.
[02:46:13.313 --> 02:46:16.616]  Well, God bless you, sir, because I am very thankful.
[02:46:17.076 --> 02:46:19.118]  You know, at one level, I
[02:46:22.301 --> 02:46:28.192]  Kenny, I get nervous because I realize so many people are listening and I know that nobody's perfect and I don't do the best job a lot of the time.
[02:46:28.232 --> 02:46:29.735]  I try my hardest though, I really do.
[02:46:31.371 --> 02:46:35.173]  And so the responsibility is pretty overwhelming.
[02:46:35.673 --> 02:46:42.396]  But at the same time, the fact that from nowhere in 16 years we built a media platform that is growing exponentially.
[02:46:42.436 --> 02:46:45.878]  That's why Google admittedly is starting to censor us and block us out.
[02:46:46.418 --> 02:46:48.759]  We've got a big article out at Infowars.com on that.
[02:46:49.179 --> 02:46:50.520]  That's why it's more important than ever.
[02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:54.962]  Make a homemade Infowars t-shirt or buy them at Infowars.com and support us.
[02:46:56.563 --> 02:46:59.225]  Folks are paying for Infowars.com billboards around the country.
[02:46:59.485 --> 02:46:59.925]  Thank you.
[02:47:00.566 --> 02:47:05.330]  TV station owners are airing my films on their local broadcast TV.
[02:47:05.610 --> 02:47:06.491]  Not just Access.
[02:47:06.531 --> 02:47:06.931]  Good.
[02:47:06.951 --> 02:47:08.953]  I get calls all the time asking permission.
[02:47:08.993 --> 02:47:09.553]  Just do it.
[02:47:10.614 --> 02:47:11.134]  Don't wait.
[02:47:11.194 --> 02:47:12.175]  Just get it out there.
[02:47:12.856 --> 02:47:14.537]  My films really are waking people up.
[02:47:15.758 --> 02:47:17.259]  And there's some other good ones out there as well.
[02:47:20.748 --> 02:47:23.070]  When you give in to corruption, everything collapses.
[02:47:23.230 --> 02:47:30.195]  And slowly we've given in to more and more to the point that Obama's launching wars and telling Congress he doesn't need their approval.
[02:47:30.695 --> 02:47:32.997]  I mean, that's big.
[02:47:33.538 --> 02:47:34.919]  And it's like State Rep.
[02:47:34.959 --> 02:47:44.966]  Simpson said, he said, why do we even have a legislature if the governor, the lieutenant governor, and the Speaker of the House are violating the rules and blocking legislation?
[02:47:45.707 --> 02:47:46.947]  Why don't we just have three men?
[02:47:47.708 --> 02:47:50.030]  And the feds say we don't need a state, so why even have a governor?
[02:47:51.328 --> 02:47:53.330]  Because they have to represent us.
[02:47:53.410 --> 02:47:55.191]  They have to answer to us.
[02:47:55.652 --> 02:47:57.153]  And it's time they answer today.
[02:47:57.173 --> 02:48:01.536]  And look, folks, we're not going to win the war against tyranny today.
[02:48:02.197 --> 02:48:04.799]  You win the war against tyranny by not laying down to it.
[02:48:05.119 --> 02:48:08.122]  And we've gotten so deep in this hole, it's going to be hard to get out of it.
[02:48:08.142 --> 02:48:08.962]  But we don't have a choice.
[02:48:09.203 --> 02:48:10.764]  The water is pouring in here.
[02:48:12.686 --> 02:48:15.388]  I mean, every time I look at my children,
[02:48:16.604 --> 02:48:24.488]  And I don't want to go down to the Capitol, or I don't want to come up here at midnight and work, or I don't want to bust my butt and make a film, or I don't want to do a TV interview.
[02:48:24.988 --> 02:48:28.630]  Because believe me, folks, I don't have some ego thing that drives me in all of this.
[02:48:29.630 --> 02:48:31.731]  Maybe 15 years ago, a little bit, it was fun.
[02:48:33.032 --> 02:48:35.353]  Now, it is nothing but responsibility.
[02:48:35.413 --> 02:48:36.173]  And it's empowering.
[02:48:36.213 --> 02:48:37.034]  I'm very alive.
[02:48:37.674 --> 02:48:39.315]  But at the same time, it's just...
[02:48:41.096 --> 02:48:43.138]  The analogy is like a hot dog eating contest.
[02:48:43.158 --> 02:48:46.600]  I like a hot dog, maybe two hot dogs, maybe three hot dogs.
[02:48:47.681 --> 02:48:56.867]  I watch these guys on hot dog eating contests that can eat 150, 200 hot dogs, and I've seen them do interviews and they say, yeah, I look at a hot dog now and I want to throw up.
[02:48:58.387 --> 02:49:01.690]  But many of you have never even been politically involved at any level.
[02:49:02.190 --> 02:49:03.591]  Eat a hot dog or two, folks.
[02:49:04.011 --> 02:49:06.172]  Eat a hamburger or two in a hamburger eating contest.
[02:49:08.120 --> 02:49:09.121]  It's a crazy analogy.
[02:49:09.942 --> 02:49:13.886]  It's just that I would love to be unknown now.
[02:49:14.306 --> 02:49:15.827]  I would love to be left alone now.
[02:49:15.928 --> 02:49:20.031]  I would love to not have to manage people and not have to organize things because I'm not a big organizer.
[02:49:21.281 --> 02:49:21.401]  Alex?
[02:49:21.682 --> 02:49:21.762]  Yes?
[02:49:45.260 --> 02:49:46.321]  It's good to talk to you.
[02:49:46.421 --> 02:49:49.303]  I just want to say thank God for people like you.
[02:49:49.743 --> 02:49:57.088]  I'm a homemaker in Corpus Christi, Texas, and I would love to be at the Capitol today with my homeschooled son, but I can't do it.
[02:49:57.128 --> 02:49:58.589]  But I will try to catch another one.
[02:49:59.130 --> 02:50:03.573]  But I had an idea, and that is, I think we need a game plan.
[02:50:03.833 --> 02:50:13.500]  When these things happen at the TSA, and we see people being violated, or it's happening to us, you know, just like we tell the kids, stop, drop, and roll.
[02:50:14.304 --> 02:50:21.382]  For a fire emergency if we could have a combined effort of we're going to do this this and this every time we see that happen.
[02:50:21.943 --> 02:50:23.266]  I think we could instead of.
[02:50:24.167 --> 02:50:28.690]  Standing by like we don't know what to do and we feel and videotaping it.
[02:50:29.090 --> 02:50:29.911]  Do you know what I'm saying?
[02:50:29.931 --> 02:50:33.313]  Like yeah, and then they act like the authorities and they yell at you.
[02:50:33.593 --> 02:50:34.714]  It's all about training you.
[02:50:34.754 --> 02:50:35.935]  It's prisoner induction.
[02:50:36.815 --> 02:50:39.517]  Total sexual assault is what TSA stands for.
[02:50:40.698 --> 02:50:44.941]  Or tyrannical slave assimilation.
[02:50:44.961 --> 02:50:48.023]  There's a lot of different terms you can use, but it is happening.
[02:50:48.043 --> 02:50:50.184]  This TSA issues bringing everybody together.
[02:50:50.585 --> 02:50:51.665]  It's waking up the world.
[02:50:52.986 --> 02:50:53.467]  It's it.
[02:50:54.467 --> 02:50:56.269]  It's another major fight we've got to face.
[02:50:56.589 --> 02:50:57.289]  Thank you so much.
[02:50:57.670 --> 02:50:59.231]  More of your phone calls straight ahead.

[02:52:10.151 --> 02:52:14.112]  They haven't increased their prices on great long-term food reserves since last year.
[02:52:14.492 --> 02:52:19.554]  With the rising cost of raw materials and gas prices, they can't hold off any longer.

[02:53:09.223 --> 02:53:12.645]  But increasingly, our customers have been asking for storable foods.

[02:54:07.674 --> 02:54:17.656]  Jammin' Texas, you're on the air.
[02:54:17.716 --> 02:54:19.637]  Thank you for holding.
[02:54:37.991 --> 02:54:39.892]  Alex, I don't know if you can hear me yet.
[02:54:39.992 --> 02:54:40.512]  Yes.
[02:54:41.613 --> 02:54:42.053]  Okay, cool.
[02:54:42.733 --> 02:54:45.694]  Um, this is actually a lot bigger than what people really expected.
[02:54:45.894 --> 02:54:49.176]  This is kind of one of those things where the Fed's gone just a little bit too far.
[02:54:49.776 --> 02:54:51.597]  They can't let us back them down.
[02:54:52.958 --> 02:54:53.258]  Okay?
[02:54:53.458 --> 02:54:57.860]  And I disagree with the whole thing, you know, we don't need TSA, we don't need any of this stuff.
[02:54:58.760 --> 02:55:00.781]  I agree with the fact that it's just... No, but you're right!
[02:55:00.821 --> 02:55:06.343]  It's about the feds getting away with bloody murder, and if one state stands up, they're all going to stand up.
[02:55:06.383 --> 02:55:08.084]  This is a lot bigger than the TSA.
[02:55:09.305 --> 02:55:09.545]  Right.
[02:55:09.845 --> 02:55:20.209]  And then if they push back against the states, say they push back against Texas, do whatever they feel like they're going to do, either blockade the state or whatever... We gotta call the bluff!
[02:55:21.827 --> 02:55:22.728]  Yes, we have to.
[02:55:22.808 --> 02:55:23.448]  We need to.
[02:55:23.468 --> 02:55:33.755]  Because if Texas, say for instance, asks for an amicable divorce, a secession, then there will be other states to follow.
[02:55:35.256 --> 02:55:40.960]  The federal government is not going to survive this if we stand our ground.
[02:55:42.241 --> 02:55:48.125]  I personally believe we need to take and start over from a constitutional government
[02:55:49.895 --> 02:55:53.157]  The Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and rebuild from there.
[02:55:54.738 --> 02:55:57.339]  But, you know, my ideas are even more radical than that.
[02:55:57.419 --> 02:56:05.443]  It's like with holding corporations to the pre-Franklin Delano Roosevelt restrictions.
[02:56:07.264 --> 02:56:11.205]  You know, so we don't get these people... Well, there's no doubt that they're engaged in pure tyranny.
[02:56:11.325 --> 02:56:13.246]  I hope everybody's there at 4 o'clock today.
[02:56:13.266 --> 02:56:15.988]  And if you can't make it then, come tonight or tomorrow.
[02:56:16.008 --> 02:56:18.349]  What do you think of my citizen filibuster idea?
[02:56:19.534 --> 02:56:22.836]  You know, I hope you get the turnout you need.
[02:56:22.856 --> 02:56:26.978]  I'm at work and I have 12 hour days right now so that's just not going to happen for me.
[02:56:27.518 --> 02:56:28.418]  But see, that's part of it.
[02:56:28.458 --> 02:56:29.439]  That's part of how they keep
[02:56:30.054 --> 02:56:34.255]  That's part of how they keep the average person from making these tricks.
[02:56:34.315 --> 02:56:38.016]  By the way, we've covered the government documents where they admit they're wanting to dumb people down.
[02:56:38.536 --> 02:56:41.997]  They're admitting they want everybody to have to work so hard so you can't ever do anything else.
[02:56:42.397 --> 02:56:47.419]  They use the fact of poverty and overworking people to control them.
[02:56:47.439 --> 02:56:49.499]  You're absolutely right, and it's sickening.
[02:56:53.482 --> 02:57:08.093]  If we just stand, if we can get the states that want to fight this can just stand and withstand the onslaught, so to speak, until it finally comes to the point that everybody and their brother realizes there's nothing you can do but secede.
[02:57:08.253 --> 02:57:10.015]  Well, there's something else that's happening here.
[02:57:10.595 --> 02:57:12.637]  We're forcing Perry out in the open.
[02:57:13.513 --> 02:57:26.277]  We're exposing the former Al Gore campaign manager and the amnesty promoter that he's introduced bills to then kill him, on record, his people kill him, so that he can claim he was for it, but then it never goes through.
[02:57:26.297 --> 02:57:28.818]  I mean, he's the new model of globalist.
[02:57:30.134 --> 02:57:32.616]  And our new stories on DrugsReport.com.
[02:57:32.656 --> 02:57:36.999]  New documents prove TSA mischaracterized safety aspects of full-body scanners.
[02:57:37.339 --> 02:57:41.301]  There's the flesh-eating bacteria in studies confirming the gloves and the floor.
[02:57:41.381 --> 02:57:42.622]  Thousands walking across it.
[02:57:42.983 --> 02:57:43.963]  It's all illegal.
[02:57:44.003 --> 02:57:46.745]  It's a total, sickening, insane power grab.
[02:57:46.765 --> 02:57:48.006]  And if they can do this, they can do anything.
[02:57:48.266 --> 02:57:51.208]  I told you years ago they'd be on the streets, because that was always their plan.
[02:57:51.248 --> 02:57:51.728]  It's happening.
[02:57:51.768 --> 02:57:52.489]  God bless you, sir.
[02:57:53.369 --> 02:57:58.193]  And I'm sorry, I'm just... Well, I want to go to... I want to go to a few other people from Texas, but...
[02:57:59.859 --> 02:58:01.549]  I am just flat out of time here.
[02:58:02.563 --> 02:58:12.087]  I am just flat out of time because I need to get ready for the fact that we're going to do something where we don't get a little permit and sit out front, you know, and have the media ignore us.
[02:58:13.548 --> 02:58:19.070]  No, we march into our house that we paid for with our representatives that we elected who work for us.
[02:58:19.550 --> 02:58:21.711]  You don't just vote for them and then the election's over.
[02:58:22.171 --> 02:58:30.095]  We're going in there to say, look, Bill of Rights, Constitution, why even have a house if the traitorous Republican leadership
[02:58:31.008 --> 02:58:33.431]  is in here killing this legislation.
[02:58:33.511 --> 02:58:37.836]  You get in there and you get that bill passed or you go for another special session.
[02:58:37.856 --> 02:58:39.618]  We'll be right back tomorrow live.
[02:58:39.939 --> 02:58:40.760]  Oh, well, hold on, hold on.
[02:58:40.780 --> 02:58:41.380]  I'm gonna come right back.
[02:58:41.400 --> 02:58:42.602]  Actually, I forgot something.
[02:58:42.662 --> 02:58:43.563]  I'm going to overdrive.
[02:58:43.663 --> 02:58:44.244]  I forgot something.
[02:58:44.264 --> 02:58:44.784]  It's too important.
[02:58:46.006 --> 02:58:48.209]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.374 --> 02:58:54.996]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:58:55.396 --> 02:58:58.397]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:58:58.637 --> 02:59:03.399]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:59:03.419 --> 02:59:09.642]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:59:09.822 --> 02:59:12.063]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:59:12.603 --> 02:59:12.883]  Tim Geithner?
[02:59:12.903 --> 02:59:13.324]  Bernanke?
[02:59:13.424 --> 02:59:14.005]  They're arsonists!
[02:59:14.025 --> 02:59:14.725]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:59:14.745 --> 02:59:16.867]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:59:31.502 --> 02:59:33.343]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:59:33.363 --> 02:59:38.426]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[02:59:38.786 --> 02:59:48.711]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:59:50.952 --> 02:59:52.113]  Coast to Coast.
[02:59:52.493 --> 02:59:53.933]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:54.534 --> 02:59:57.755]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:08.118 --> 03:00:08.519]  That's right.
[03:00:17.273 --> 03:00:22.877]  We are going to fail over and over again in the fight against tyranny like George Washington did, but we're going to win in the end.
[03:00:23.677 --> 03:00:24.778]  Resistance is victory.
[03:00:24.798 --> 03:00:35.525]  I'm going to take a few final calls in this emergency overdrive for just the next five minutes, but the main reason I went into overdrive is to let audio, video, internet listeners, because we're not on AM and FM stations right now.
[03:00:35.545 --> 03:00:37.026]  I got Summer carrying it.
[03:00:37.747 --> 03:00:39.008]  I meant to plug this during the show.
[03:00:39.048 --> 03:00:40.849]  I just forget everything because there's so much going on.
[03:00:42.261 --> 03:00:57.495]  We're going to have a blurb posted at about three o'clock at InfoWars and Prison Planet and a red link that is going to have embedded on it a Justin.TV
[03:00:59.395 --> 03:01:01.036]  What's the other name of the other system we use?
[03:01:02.056 --> 03:01:03.617]  Ustream that we found works even better.
[03:01:04.337 --> 03:01:06.118]  People complain about the Justin.TV ads.
[03:01:06.638 --> 03:01:07.358]  It's a free service.
[03:01:07.378 --> 03:01:08.239]  We're not getting that money.
[03:01:08.519 --> 03:01:13.641]  Justin.TV, we're able to stream live and get it to you, but then there's an ad.
[03:01:13.681 --> 03:01:14.021]  I'm sorry.
[03:01:14.061 --> 03:01:14.561]  It's the way it is.
[03:01:15.081 --> 03:01:16.622]  You got Ustream the same way.
[03:01:16.642 --> 03:01:18.543]  I'm not even bringing that up.
[03:01:18.663 --> 03:01:19.423]  Go ahead and complain.
[03:01:19.443 --> 03:01:20.504]  I'm going to be down there at the Capitol.
[03:01:21.104 --> 03:01:26.366]  We're going to have that video up at InfoWars.com with live streaming from the Capitol.
[03:01:26.786 --> 03:01:28.387]  I don't know how well it'll work, so we've got
[03:01:29.687 --> 03:01:34.168]  Quicks, Ustream and Justin.TV, three different things rigged up on the iPhone 4.
[03:01:35.168 --> 03:01:39.469]  And so we're going to have Aaron and Rob down there with me.
[03:01:40.289 --> 03:01:45.610]  And so they'll be shooting video on high quality to document what's happening to be put out tomorrow and the next few days.
[03:01:46.110 --> 03:01:47.730]  But we'll also be having live streams.
[03:01:47.850 --> 03:01:55.571]  And so there'll be a page on InfoWars that says live coverage of March on Texas Capitol or something like that.
[03:01:56.172 --> 03:01:57.852]  And it'll have my Twitter feed.
[03:01:58.712 --> 03:02:02.873]  For photos, it'll have a bunch of other things there.
[03:02:03.393 --> 03:02:05.874]  So in case something happens, we can get it out live.
[03:02:07.074 --> 03:02:09.955]  So definitely be watching that, starting around 4 o'clock.
[03:02:10.775 --> 03:02:12.816]  As we walk up, we'll start shooting some video.
[03:02:13.436 --> 03:02:16.897]  And please call everybody you know, even if you can't be there, and tell them to get down to the Capitol.
[03:02:17.877 --> 03:02:20.558]  And don't always thank me and count on somebody else to do it, folks.
[03:02:20.598 --> 03:02:21.599]  You gotta get down there.
[03:02:21.879 --> 03:02:23.379]  It doesn't even mean we're gonna win this thing.
[03:02:23.419 --> 03:02:24.900]  But we made them go into special session.
[03:02:25.280 --> 03:02:26.201]  We made them bring it back.
[03:02:26.241 --> 03:02:28.462]  We exposed Perry's killing this behind the scenes.
[03:02:29.122 --> 03:02:29.842]  That's a big deal.
[03:02:30.883 --> 03:02:34.524]  Because by probing the globalists, you expose their operations.
[03:02:34.864 --> 03:02:36.745]  You just lay down, they're gonna roll over the top of you.
[03:02:37.085 --> 03:02:38.326]  Mark in Texas, you're on the air.
[03:02:38.406 --> 03:02:38.946]  Thanks for holding.
[03:02:40.031 --> 03:02:40.791]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[03:02:40.811 --> 03:02:41.492]  I'm pretty good.
[03:02:41.512 --> 03:02:43.292]  I just want to tell you that I'll be down there.
[03:02:43.332 --> 03:02:56.217]  I'm leaving Houston in five minutes and I thought of a bunch of reasons why, you know, excuses actually why I shouldn't, you know, because it's a two-hour drive and this and that.
[03:02:56.237 --> 03:02:58.598]  I've got to pick my wife up at the bus stop at work.
[03:02:59.098 --> 03:03:01.679]  And as a matter of fact, I can make arrangements to have her picked up.
[03:03:02.099 --> 03:03:08.722]  And anyone who doesn't get up, who can get there, you know, physically make it there within a couple hour radius,
[03:03:09.258 --> 03:03:13.112]  And I don't think they even deserve the freedom that you're fighting for us for.
[03:03:14.082 --> 03:03:17.123]  You've been fighting a long time for us.
[03:03:17.143 --> 03:03:18.163]  Well, I've done nothing.
[03:03:18.243 --> 03:03:21.144]  People at Bunker Hill got gunned down by the Redcoats.
[03:03:21.944 --> 03:03:32.967]  Half of George Washington's troops, I've read the French and other records of it, will be marching through the snow from Ticonderoga and the British captured guns with blood in the snow.
[03:03:33.007 --> 03:03:34.688]  You ever had your shoes break down?
[03:03:35.068 --> 03:03:36.708]  Those old-fashioned shoes would break down.
[03:03:36.968 --> 03:03:38.809]  These are guys in zero temperatures.
[03:03:39.049 --> 03:03:42.290]  Did you know, I forget the number, it was something like 50 men died
[03:03:43.050 --> 03:03:52.486]  Froze to death the night, the night march across the frozen Delaware to go into Trenton, New Jersey and take on the overwhelming German troops, the British mercs.
[03:03:52.927 --> 03:03:55.631]  I mean, a whole bunch of the men froze to death.
[03:03:56.733 --> 03:04:02.157]  And their old-fashioned cloaks froze to death so that we would have the little bit of freedom we've got.
[03:04:02.558 --> 03:04:03.779]  So I don't deserve any credit.
[03:04:03.979 --> 03:04:05.120]  I'm not freezing to death.
[03:04:05.360 --> 03:04:08.162]  I'm not walking through snow dragging giant guns behind me.
[03:04:08.583 --> 03:04:12.466]  Men through snow till their shoes broke off dragging the guns in.
[03:04:12.486 --> 03:04:15.488]  It was something like a hundred miles dragging giant guns.
[03:04:16.129 --> 03:04:21.633]  Men dragging guns on ropes through the snow with no shoes with a trail of blood behind them.
[03:04:22.373 --> 03:04:23.474]  So God bless you my friend.
[03:04:23.494 --> 03:04:23.915]  Anything else?
[03:04:25.251 --> 03:04:31.117]  Uh, yeah, I just wanted to say that, you know, um, I'm sure you would have been there if we were back in that time.
[03:04:31.177 --> 03:04:31.958]  We would have been there.
[03:04:32.438 --> 03:04:37.043]  Um, I'm just saying that you've sacrificed a lot as far as, uh, I read your post yesterday.
[03:04:37.323 --> 03:04:39.786]  You wish you could do this all day, but you had to go beyond the air.
[03:04:40.086 --> 03:04:42.549]  You know, you've given up a lot, so don't underestimate stuff.
[03:04:43.169 --> 03:04:44.230]  Well, I hope to meet you there.
[03:04:44.270 --> 03:04:45.491]  I should be there past six.
[03:04:45.972 --> 03:04:46.853]  God bless you, my friend.
[03:04:46.873 --> 03:04:47.934]  Other folks will be showing up.
[03:04:47.974 --> 03:04:52.318]  Last time we did this, I told even bigger crowds were there at like midnight, the paper reported.
[03:04:52.378 --> 03:04:54.821]  So, everybody get there today, tomorrow, the next day.
[03:04:55.041 --> 03:04:56.102]  Just make sure you get there.
[03:04:56.122 --> 03:04:57.123]  Resistance is victory.
[03:04:57.383 --> 03:04:59.606]  We may not even win this battle, but we will win the war.
[03:05:00.827 --> 03:05:04.931]  You know that drinking pure, high-alkaline water is one of the most important factors in maintaining
