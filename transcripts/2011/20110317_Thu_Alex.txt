[00:00:05.441 --> 00:00:10.263]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.263 --> 00:00:11.844]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.844 --> 00:00:13.384]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.384 --> 00:00:17.586]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.586 --> 00:00:21.648]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.058 --> 00:00:27.880]  We are live, my friends.
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.644]  It is Thursday, the 17th day of March 2011.
[00:00:32.644 --> 00:00:38.469]  We're going to be here at least for the next three hours live.
[00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:47.817]  Now, Dr. Doug Rocky is undergoing medical treatment, a nuclear physicist in his own right, former head of the Pentagon's DU program.
[00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.840]  I think?
[00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:18.284]  But he did give us his colleagues, name a number, who it turns out is one of the most prestigious people out there working and reporting for BBC, you name it.
[00:01:18.284 --> 00:01:31.050]  Dr. Chris Busby will be joining us today and he's tracking the government and private radiation monitors in the Pacific, in the Aleutians, in Alaska, and here in the United States.
[00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:41.958]  The New York Times did confirm that the United Nations and federal government expect for radiation to make landfall sometime tomorrow in Southern California.
[00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:45.521]  The jet stream, like a snake, winds around the earth.
[00:01:45.521 --> 00:01:52.826]  The band that goes over Japan moves between northern United States, southern Canada, and southern California.
[00:01:52.826 --> 00:01:54.387]  It moves back and forth.
[00:01:54.387 --> 00:01:59.872]  The band that went over six days ago, when the meltdowns began at Fukushima Complex,
[00:02:03.314 --> 00:02:06.916]  Again, it's moving north and south, back and forth.
[00:02:06.916 --> 00:02:16.521]  That band that was over Japan six days ago will now be reaching the United States tomorrow and coming in around Southern California.
[00:02:16.521 --> 00:02:28.728]  Though it will then, if it follows past forecast, will start moving north again over Oregon, Washington State, and Southwestern Canada.
[00:02:30.191 --> 00:02:31.312]  I don't think so.
[00:02:52.467 --> 00:02:58.231]  And again, we don't know where the jet stream will be exactly, but it's forecast to move north at that point.
[00:02:58.231 --> 00:03:04.716]  So the first radiation that's going to be hitting is forecast by the New York Times to be light.
[00:03:04.716 --> 00:03:10.340]  The problem is, we reported on this yesterday.
[00:03:11.431 --> 00:03:13.692]  Kurt Nimmo did.
[00:03:13.692 --> 00:03:25.240]  It was some of the crew in there that pointed out that Japan in the Fukushima Prefecture and surrounding states was, and we'll show that map on screen, was not
[00:03:26.365 --> 00:03:30.847]  Repeat, not reporting from the worst hit areas five days in.
[00:03:30.847 --> 00:03:33.008]  They're still not reporting.
[00:03:33.008 --> 00:03:35.169]  We'll put that map up live time.
[00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:37.630]  They're still not reporting in those key areas.
[00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.311]  Again, most of it's being blown out to sea.
[00:03:39.311 --> 00:03:52.957]  If you look south though, you see the red area where they are reporting high levels of radiation, but they're saying that they're under survey and still collating data from the Fukushima area and north of there.
[00:03:53.837 --> 00:04:02.379]  And we wrote the article, Government's Corporations Push Cover-Up of Japanese Nuclear Nightmare.
[00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:15.503]  And a data map of radiation levels in Japan posted by the TargetMap website has omitted information from the Fukushima Prefecture, that's the state where nuclear reactors are currently melting down.
[00:04:15.503 --> 00:04:16.603]  Now, this morning
[00:04:17.763 --> 00:04:21.385]  Uh, we posted this yesterday afternoon when the show was still running.
[00:04:21.385 --> 00:04:25.106]  Uh, not bragging, I'm just showing we know what we're talking about here.
[00:04:25.106 --> 00:04:30.909]  We are a very credible source of information, not because we're smart, but because we're not lying to you.
[00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:37.752]  We're following historic nuclear fallout patterns, cover-up patterns, uh, reportage patterns.
[00:04:37.752 --> 00:04:39.333]  Uh, USA Today does report
[00:04:40.033 --> 00:04:45.577]  The Japanese government radiation report for the 47 states Wednesday had notable omission.
[00:04:45.577 --> 00:04:50.701]  Fukushima ground zero and the surrounding areas about 100 kilometers in all areas.
[00:04:50.701 --> 00:04:54.664]  There is a cover-up, but the cover-up expands into our own government.
[00:04:54.664 --> 00:04:59.808]  Radiation set to make landfall in T-minus less than 24 hours, Southern California.
[00:05:00.872 --> 00:05:02.054]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:05:02.054 --> 00:05:08.981]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:05:08.981 --> 00:05:11.544]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:05:11.544 --> 00:05:16.930]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.974]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:05:19.974 --> 00:05:22.036]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:05:22.276 --> 00:05:28.519]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:05:28.519 --> 00:05:31.900]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:37.683]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:05:37.683 --> 00:05:39.324]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:05:39.324 --> 00:05:40.604]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:05:40.604 --> 00:05:43.285]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:05:43.285 --> 00:05:44.706]  He explains everything you need to know.
[00:05:44.966 --> 00:05:47.308]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:06:02.435 --> 00:06:06.396]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:06:06.396 --> 00:06:15.257]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:06:15.257 --> 00:06:19.898]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:06:19.898 --> 00:06:30.700]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:40.863]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:06:40.863 --> 00:06:46.285]  Very easy to follow, step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:06:46.285 --> 00:06:53.768]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:06:53.768 --> 00:06:56.189]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:07:01.713 --> 00:07:05.737]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:07:05.737 --> 00:07:08.981]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:07:08.981 --> 00:07:13.786]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:07:13.786 --> 00:07:20.172]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:07:20.172 --> 00:07:22.415]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:07:22.935 --> 00:07:24.116]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:07:24.116 --> 00:07:24.876]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:07:24.876 --> 00:07:26.557]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:07:41.846 --> 00:07:49.111]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:07:49.111 --> 00:07:58.236]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:08:02.338 --> 00:08:08.967]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.967 --> 00:08:11.951]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.745 --> 00:08:21.986]  Well, the situation is deteriorating quickly, obviously.
[00:08:21.986 --> 00:08:28.548]  The New York Times, talking to multiple government sources, the U.S.
[00:08:28.548 --> 00:08:44.494]  Department of Energy, the International Atomic Energy Agency at the United Nations are all confirming that they expect radiation to hit the Aleutian Islands today and to hit Southern California tomorrow.
[00:08:44.494 --> 00:08:45.154]  Now, remember,
[00:08:45.970 --> 00:09:00.270]  This is the radiation from Friday's Fukushima leak, which did report moderate levels of three different isotopes, strontium, cesium, and a radioactive isotope of iodine.
[00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:01.331]  Those are nothing!
[00:09:02.264 --> 00:09:08.130]  They're very toxic, very radioactive, but nothing compared to uranium and plutonium.
[00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:22.164]  From looking at it, knowing that 600,000 plus rods were stored there when Fukushima 1 blew up Saturday, that radiation will be arriving a few days after the radiation from Friday, or as early as a day after.
[00:09:22.164 --> 00:09:23.366]  We're talking about Saturday.
[00:09:25.305 --> 00:09:30.027]  Jet stream winds like a snake around the world, but it's one stream.
[00:09:30.027 --> 00:09:34.528]  The stream that goes directly over Japan is the stream that moves north to south.
[00:09:34.528 --> 00:09:39.990]  It varies in a weather pattern from southern California is as southerly as it generally goes.
[00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:45.051]  Sometimes it goes into northern Mexico, and then it goes as high as Alaska.
[00:09:45.051 --> 00:09:46.812]  It moves back and forth.
[00:09:47.625 --> 00:10:01.504]  The band that was going over Japan on Friday when Fukushima first was hit by the 9.1 earthquake and the tsunami that knocked out its diesel power and its emergency battery power as well as its primary electrical power line power.
[00:10:02.959 --> 00:10:08.481]  It was going over Fukushima when it had leaks that are nothing compared to what's happened since then.
[00:10:08.481 --> 00:10:11.102]  So that's the first radiation that's getting here.
[00:10:11.102 --> 00:10:19.344]  Weather forecast following past models believe that the jet stream will start moving in the next few days more northerly.
[00:10:19.344 --> 00:10:24.446]  And that's bad news for Oregon, Washington State, and southern Canada.
[00:10:24.986 --> 00:10:25.427]  So it's
[00:10:42.691 --> 00:10:52.380]  And the internal containment vessels got breached on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday through Thursday with continual fires and explosions.
[00:10:52.380 --> 00:11:06.032]  ABC News reported the Japanese government stated yesterday, we read the quotes on air, that the explosions and radiation is so high that they morally don't even want to send in the Fukushima 50 who have said they're willing to die.
[00:11:06.032 --> 00:11:06.533]  They have 180 men in
[00:11:10.223 --> 00:11:12.885]  50-person rotations going in.
[00:11:12.885 --> 00:11:16.987]  It's also being reported by mainstream news that we pointed out two days ago.
[00:11:16.987 --> 00:11:18.968]  Where are Japanese robots?
[00:11:18.968 --> 00:11:21.269]  The Japanese are robot crazy.
[00:11:21.269 --> 00:11:23.711]  Where are the robots at Fukushima?
[00:11:23.711 --> 00:11:28.754]  Well, the truth is robots just can't get the job done at their current developmental stage that humans can.
[00:11:29.794 --> 00:11:33.916]  Though robots also have trouble operating in radiation as well.
[00:11:33.916 --> 00:11:36.377]  So does camera equipment, you name it.
[00:11:36.377 --> 00:11:40.639]  And the radiation is obviously rising off the charts.
[00:11:40.639 --> 00:11:56.486]  That's why on Monday when Fukushima-3, the plutonium-based system, blew sky-high with hundreds of thousands of rods stored on top of the building, ejected into the sky, not just the containment area breached, but those rods ejected into the sky, that's when the USS Ronald Reagan
[00:11:56.786 --> 00:12:01.750]  The Japanese are covering up the radiation levels in the two prefectures or the states surrounding Fukushima.
[00:12:17.796 --> 00:12:18.176]  Most of the
[00:12:36.135 --> 00:12:43.460]  straight to the east out over the ocean with the jet stream going west to east directly towards the United States.
[00:12:43.460 --> 00:13:00.631]  So the first radiation the New York Times reports is set to be hitting the Aleutian Islands today and the southern west coast of the United States, Southern California tomorrow with the jet stream set as it moves up and down south to north
[00:13:01.431 --> 00:13:30.068]  On a daily basis to as the worst radiation comes in moving more towards the north or it may stay on Southern California and that is one of the worst case scenarios reported on Monday and Tuesday by a meteorologist is that if that radiation comes in as you know with the smog with the mountains to the east of San Diego and Los Angeles and other areas that it will trap the radiation over the city.
[00:13:31.033 --> 00:13:52.978]  If I lived as a precaution, I personally, if I lived in Los Angeles or in that area hemmed in by the mountains, by the high desert, where you have the jet stream that comes in and then builds up and then turns north there because of the mountains and runs up the mountain range, I would calmly be heading south
[00:13:54.076 --> 00:13:55.137]  East.
[00:13:55.137 --> 00:13:57.139]  I would be going into Arizona.
[00:13:57.139 --> 00:13:59.001]  I would be going into Texas.
[00:13:59.001 --> 00:14:01.403]  I would be going into Mississippi and Louisiana.
[00:14:01.403 --> 00:14:04.526]  I will be honest with the audience.
[00:14:04.526 --> 00:14:06.588]  I am not leaving the United States.
[00:14:08.117 --> 00:14:15.219]  But I don't sit here and take a government that covered up Chernobyl, that covered up Three Mile Island, when this clearly is now dwarfing it.
[00:14:15.219 --> 00:14:25.581]  Make no mistake, there's been multiple total meltdowns, fires in the reactors, fuel rods, 600,000 of them thrown every way you can imagine, fires in every containment facility.
[00:14:25.581 --> 00:14:28.421]  That place is a total nightmare.
[00:14:28.421 --> 00:14:35.523]  And what happens is you get moderate exposure, and then your child who's eight years old gets leukemia when they're 18.
[00:14:37.071 --> 00:14:40.252]  Or your two-year-old gets leukemia when they're seven.
[00:14:40.252 --> 00:14:53.536]  And we know, and this is even in the New York Times and Associated Press, that an estimated 1 million people in the last 25 years have died from complications in Europe from Chernobyl.
[00:14:53.536 --> 00:15:00.858]  In an article that is extremely detailed and extremely important by Paul Joseph Watson that must be gotten out to everyone,
[00:15:02.384 --> 00:15:02.705]  U.S.
[00:15:02.705 --> 00:15:05.689]  government cannot be trusted on radiation plume.
[00:15:05.689 --> 00:15:10.657]  We have the animated government map of what happened in
[00:15:13.518 --> 00:15:21.081]  1986 in Europe, and if you're a PrisonPlanet.tv viewer, we're gonna be playing that video over the audio while I'm speaking here.
[00:15:21.081 --> 00:15:38.308]  We'll start rolling that now, showing what happened in the 10 days after Chernobyl, as it went out of Ukraine, into Northern Europe, into Scandinavia, turned back west over England, over Germany, over France, and then settling in over Italy.
[00:15:39.005 --> 00:15:45.650]  For six months, the Italian government, I saw a comment in a news article, I pulled it up, it turned out it was true.
[00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:52.276]  For six months in Italy, they only ate frozen food from the United States and Asia.
[00:15:52.276 --> 00:16:01.844]  They would not feed in the schools, public and private, by government order, any fresh produce or milk products grown in Europe.
[00:16:01.844 --> 00:16:04.005]  And you can see the map on screen.
[00:16:04.005 --> 00:16:06.708]  All of Europe got a dose of it.
[00:16:08.135 --> 00:16:15.063]  All of Europe, Eastern Europe and Russia got massive dose and that is only over 10 days.
[00:16:15.063 --> 00:16:20.310]  It then circled the earth at measurable levels for another two years.
[00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:24.214]  The red area you see is guaranteed death within a week to a year.
[00:16:24.855 --> 00:16:29.117]  The orange area, they're talking about decades taken off your life.
[00:16:29.117 --> 00:16:34.038]  The yellow area, many years taken off your life, increased cancers.
[00:16:34.038 --> 00:16:39.841]  Just absolutely incredible what happened with Chernobyl.
[00:16:39.841 --> 00:16:50.965]  Now, remember, Chernobyl was a smaller plant that only had one explosion, and then fires for a day, and then another eight days.
[00:16:52.874 --> 00:16:58.421]  of steam rising out of the reactor 4.
[00:16:58.421 --> 00:17:03.888]  The other reactors there did not explode and were not damaged.
[00:17:03.888 --> 00:17:09.876]  One million dead in the 25 years since 1986.
[00:17:09.876 --> 00:17:11.157]  One million dead.
[00:17:11.157 --> 00:17:12.218]  I'm going to be honest with you.
[00:17:13.618 --> 00:17:20.840]  I'm trying, we're talking to family right now, trying to find somebody to go with my wife and children and leave the United States, perhaps for a month.
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:21.341]  You know why?
[00:17:21.341 --> 00:17:32.924]  Because I know radiation, I've studied it, I know the government's going to tell us everything's fine, and those maps are going to be suppressed from the American people, and we're not going to be told how bad it is.
[00:17:32.924 --> 00:17:40.407]  And I'm not going to sit there and let my children huff uranium and plutonium and strontium and radioactive iodine and cesium.
[00:17:41.184 --> 00:17:45.070]  So, I'm going to stay here and report.
[00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:48.114]  But I'm telling you right now, I'm watching the weather patterns.
[00:17:48.114 --> 00:17:57.228]  I'm going to watch what comes out from private radiation meters in California, in Washington, in Oregon, in Southern
[00:17:59.326 --> 00:17:59.866]  I don't know.
[00:18:15.469 --> 00:18:20.891]  Because I'm not going to sit here and have my little darlings huffing that stuff like the Europeans did.
[00:18:20.891 --> 00:18:22.011]  Period.
[00:18:22.011 --> 00:18:22.492]  Period.
[00:18:22.492 --> 00:18:23.832]  Now, it will blow over.
[00:18:23.832 --> 00:18:29.794]  It'll get mixed in with sand and dirt and then tends to get diluted.
[00:18:29.794 --> 00:18:34.036]  It's still radioactive for billions of years, but you have less of a chance of breathing it.
[00:18:34.036 --> 00:18:38.658]  But when rain hits in the next week across the United States after this radiation passes,
[00:18:39.378 --> 00:18:42.661]  Believe me folks, you don't want to be out there running around in the rain.
[00:18:42.661 --> 00:18:45.083]  You don't want to get any of this on you.
[00:18:45.083 --> 00:18:49.407]  Because it will increase your cancer risk exponentially.
[00:18:49.407 --> 00:18:52.189]  And the government and the media is not going to tell you this.
[00:18:52.189 --> 00:18:52.910]  I'll guarantee you.
[00:18:53.749 --> 00:18:53.889]  That's
[00:19:10.123 --> 00:19:24.227]  have a long history, especially in the U.S., of covering everything up, including Three Mile Island, which was estimated a decade after, in the early 1980s, a decade after it happened in the early 1970s, to be at least 100 times what they had said.
[00:19:24.227 --> 00:19:25.888]  And that was on the East Coast.
[00:19:25.888 --> 00:19:28.088]  That blew out to sea.
[00:19:28.088 --> 00:19:30.249]  Most of that blew out to sea.
[00:19:30.249 --> 00:19:36.571]  Okay, what's happening in Japan is blowing out to sea directly towards us.
[00:19:36.571 --> 00:19:36.831]  Okay?
[00:19:37.728 --> 00:19:42.533]  Now, four reactors have blown sky high.
[00:19:42.533 --> 00:19:47.378]  600,000 rods are in a state of disarray, ejected into the air, on fire.
[00:19:47.378 --> 00:19:52.143]  This is dwarfing Chernobyl conservatively.
[00:19:52.143 --> 00:19:52.984]  Dwarfing Chernobyl.
[00:19:52.984 --> 00:19:54.665]  And many experts are now saying that.
[00:19:54.665 --> 00:19:57.188]  Dr. Bob Bowman, three days ago, said this could easily dwarf Chernobyl.
[00:19:57.188 --> 00:19:59.450]  I want to get him to pop back in today.
[00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:00.872]  We do have a big expert coming on.
[00:20:02.381 --> 00:20:05.762]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.
[00:20:05.762 --> 00:20:13.946]  I designed our top-selling holster, the Super Tuck Deluxe, to solve the problems of being poked, pinched, and gouged while carrying concealed.
[00:20:13.946 --> 00:20:19.268]  The Super Tuck Deluxe is the most comfortable, most concealable holster on the market today.

[00:20:30.752 --> 00:20:31.993]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:20:31.993 --> 00:20:36.556]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:20:36.556 --> 00:20:42.360]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:46.002]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:20:46.002 --> 00:20:48.724]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:48.724 --> 00:20:53.787]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[00:20:53.787 --> 00:20:54.028]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:54.028 --> 00:20:55.429]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:01.052 --> 00:21:02.993]  America, you've been warned.
[00:21:02.993 --> 00:21:10.034]  For weeks, we've been warning you about a single event we believe will happen in the next 12 months that will shake the very foundations of our nation.
[00:21:10.034 --> 00:21:13.415]  We've told you about the video that details this shocking prediction.
[00:21:13.415 --> 00:21:17.096]  So far, over 6 million people have watched this free video online.
[00:21:17.096 --> 00:21:17.896]  Have you?
[00:21:17.896 --> 00:21:24.618]  Again, this big event has nothing to do with war or the stock market, yet it could change everything about your normal way of life, the way you shop,
[00:21:27.216 --> 00:21:29.200]  Even how you take care of your health and your family.
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.382]  Could this really happen?
[00:21:30.382 --> 00:21:34.369]  Well, the man who created this video has been right about many predictions in his career.
[00:21:34.369 --> 00:21:36.353]  He was among the first to predict the collapse of GM.
[00:21:41.923 --> 00:21:42.364]  We're good.
[00:22:01.519 --> 00:22:05.821]  Becoming a modern smoker is now easier and more cost-effective, thanks to Lecig.

[00:23:00.464 --> 00:23:23.649]  Due to the extreme conditions from the Japanese earthquake and the fallout of depleted uranium, HempUSA.org recommends new important products that are loaded with iodine, micro plant powder, green life kelp powder, raw unprocessed red palm oil, and our 10% roll-on clear iodine that heals the skin and naturally puts iodine back into your entire body.

[00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:39.136]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:23:39.136 --> 00:23:39.937]  This capitalism?
[00:23:39.937 --> 00:23:46.221]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:23:46.221 --> 00:23:47.022]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:23:47.022 --> 00:23:50.164]  I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[00:23:50.164 --> 00:23:51.104]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[00:23:51.104 --> 00:23:52.505]  It's time to understand the system.
[00:23:52.505 --> 00:23:52.825]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:23:52.825 --> 00:23:53.106]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:24:12.615 --> 00:24:15.997]  Now I want everybody to pay very close attention to what I'm saying.
[00:24:17.571 --> 00:24:25.398]  And Kurt Nemo has written an article on this today that is at InfoWars.com.
[00:24:25.398 --> 00:24:30.383]  In fact, I'll pull that up and put it on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:24:30.383 --> 00:24:33.746]  For listeners who are radio listeners, just go to InfoWars.com.
[00:24:33.746 --> 00:24:42.254]  The Japanese government, USA Today, has confirmed what we first reported yesterday is not, repeat, not reporting
[00:24:44.696 --> 00:24:53.584]  Radiation levels from the two states surrounding Fukushima with the four reactors that are in a state of total bedlam.
[00:24:53.584 --> 00:24:59.209]  Headline government corporations push cover-up of Japanese nuclear nightmare.
[00:25:00.271 --> 00:25:00.291]  I
[00:25:16.181 --> 00:25:17.242]  The fleet is there.
[00:25:17.242 --> 00:25:18.883]  The troops are at Okinawa.
[00:25:18.883 --> 00:25:27.749]  The troops there with the NBC, Nuclear Chemical Biological Detectors, very high tech, are in Seoul and all over the Pacific area.
[00:25:27.749 --> 00:25:32.772]  We are now six plus days into this unfolding disaster.
[00:25:32.772 --> 00:25:42.298]  Six and a half days ago, this began and we have been given nothing from Fukushima that is blowing directly out to sea.
[00:25:42.298 --> 00:25:46.021]  Do you understand the treason?
[00:25:46.802 --> 00:25:55.030]  This is the same government that puts sodium fluoride in our water knowing it causes bone cancer at seven times the rate for men, three times for women.
[00:25:56.015 --> 00:26:01.359]  This is the same government that rolls out GMOs that every other country refuses.
[00:26:01.359 --> 00:26:05.403]  This is the same government that approves drugs on the market that other countries won't approve.
[00:26:05.403 --> 00:26:08.385]  They could care less about us.
[00:26:08.385 --> 00:26:13.769]  Again, the headline, Pentagon cover-up of data on Fukushima disaster.
[00:26:13.769 --> 00:26:16.451]  It is not only the Japanese doing this.
[00:26:16.451 --> 00:26:17.813]  As I told you yesterday,
[00:26:18.453 --> 00:26:22.680]  Governments, corporations push cover-up of Japanese nuclear disaster.
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:29.011]  Kurt Nemo's article breaks down that our government, the Japanese government, and others are covering this up.
[00:26:29.011 --> 00:26:30.353]  They are not releasing the data.
[00:26:31.311 --> 00:26:41.159]  You've had four reactors blow sky-high, 600,000 rods ejected all over the place, fires going intensely since Saturday.
[00:26:41.159 --> 00:26:44.962]  Intensifying Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, today.
[00:26:44.962 --> 00:26:48.885]  Fires, smoke, continuing, radioactive.
[00:26:48.885 --> 00:26:50.927]  And now, the U.S.
[00:26:50.927 --> 00:26:55.050]  military, this is the Wall Street Journal, at a glance, U.S.
[00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:56.792]  begins evacuations of Japan.
[00:26:57.657 --> 00:26:57.977]  The U.S.
[00:26:57.977 --> 00:27:02.579]  Department of State has authorized last night the voluntary evacuation of U.S.
[00:27:02.579 --> 00:27:03.699]  dependents of U.S.
[00:27:03.699 --> 00:27:12.203]  government personnel based in northeast Japan as concerns mounted about the levels of radiation emerging and emanating from the stricken Japanese nuclear reactors.
[00:27:12.203 --> 00:27:19.105]  As of yesterday morning, all the top experts said that if they don't contain this in 48 hours, it will be worse than Chernobyl.
[00:27:19.105 --> 00:27:23.007]  Ladies and gentlemen, it was worse than Chernobyl when the Mark 1 Fukushima 3
[00:27:23.587 --> 00:27:32.101]  Blue up in that big black mushroom cloud and ejected hundreds of thousands of fuel rods stored on the roof into the atmosphere.
[00:27:32.101 --> 00:27:33.203]  Okay?
[00:27:33.203 --> 00:27:35.106]  And again, New York Times.
[00:27:36.246 --> 00:27:39.127]  Quotes from Department of Energy and the United Nations.
[00:27:39.127 --> 00:27:41.328]  They expect radiation to hit the Aleutians.
[00:27:41.328 --> 00:27:43.109]  We went and looked at the Aleutian Island detectors.
[00:27:43.109 --> 00:27:44.270]  It says you gotta register.
[00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:45.590]  We can't get in.
[00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:47.331]  We'll keep trying.
[00:27:47.331 --> 00:27:48.692]  But they're expecting that today.
[00:27:48.692 --> 00:27:51.233]  We know the government's clamping down on media.
[00:27:51.233 --> 00:27:57.876]  And we saw that bizarre report out of Alaska, who would be one of the first to get it, from some of the northerly winds, that they had detected it.
[00:27:57.876 --> 00:28:00.437]  But in the article they said that they hadn't detected it.
[00:28:00.437 --> 00:28:02.418]  We don't know what's going on.
[00:28:03.268 --> 00:28:13.236]  We're going to have to rely on the private detector sites that are out there and organizations that we're creating lists of to post at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:28:13.236 --> 00:28:16.899]  And that's the prime directive to all my writers right now listening.
[00:28:16.899 --> 00:28:20.942]  Start collating large lists, because we link to just one as we've done, it crashes them.
[00:28:21.502 --> 00:28:28.468]  To all the private universities, public universities, private networks that are tracking radiation.
[00:28:28.468 --> 00:28:41.219]  We are seeing YouTube videos, but we don't know if they're real, of people in Southern California already showing a doubling in normal background radiation from the tabletop units that are hooked in to internet networks.
[00:28:41.559 --> 00:28:44.921]  That's also in Paul Joseph Watson's article, U.S.
[00:28:44.921 --> 00:28:48.844]  Government Cannot Be Trusted on Radiation Plume.
[00:28:48.844 --> 00:28:52.747]  And we'll put that article back on screen so you can see the USA Today.
[00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:55.141]  Well, isn't that funny?
[00:29:18.132 --> 00:29:19.033]  Isn't that funny?
[00:29:19.033 --> 00:29:20.434]  Because that's what they always say.
[00:29:20.434 --> 00:29:32.262]  They tell the troops there's no health effects from depleted uranium, which we know has been devastating, and a 12 to 15 times increase in cancers in cities like Fallujah in Iraq where it's been used.
[00:29:32.262 --> 00:29:40.128]  And it is child's play compared to live plutonium, uranium, and other isotopes splattered into the atmosphere.
[00:29:40.128 --> 00:29:41.269]  So that's all coming up.
[00:29:42.049 --> 00:29:43.170]  We're gonna be breaking it all down.
[00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:47.433]  There's also some type of leak in a reactor going on in Canada that we mentioned yesterday.
[00:29:47.433 --> 00:29:48.834]  There's more news on that.
[00:29:48.834 --> 00:29:51.336]  We'll break down after the break.
[00:29:51.336 --> 00:29:52.738]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.738 --> 00:29:55.260]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:57.962]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:05.492]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:30:05.492 --> 00:30:06.413]  Number one.
[00:30:06.413 --> 00:30:09.835]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:09.835 --> 00:30:10.695]  Number two.
[00:30:10.695 --> 00:30:15.598]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:15.598 --> 00:30:16.338]  It's true.
[00:30:16.338 --> 00:30:21.201]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:21.201 --> 00:30:22.041]  Number three.
[00:30:22.041 --> 00:30:25.623]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:25.623 --> 00:30:29.325]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:30:29.525 --> 00:30:30.325]  Number 4.
[00:30:30.325 --> 00:30:33.087]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:30:33.087 --> 00:30:36.768]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:36.768 --> 00:30:37.548]  Number 5.
[00:30:37.548 --> 00:30:41.690]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:46.752]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:30:46.752 --> 00:30:50.934]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:50.934 --> 00:30:52.715]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:52.715 --> 00:30:57.317]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[00:30:57.897 --> 00:31:00.839]  877-327-0365.
[00:31:00.839 --> 00:31:08.922]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:31:08.922 --> 00:31:11.484]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:31:11.484 --> 00:31:16.646]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:31:16.846 --> 00:31:19.887]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:31:19.887 --> 00:31:22.208]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:31:22.208 --> 00:31:28.471]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:31:28.471 --> 00:31:31.852]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:31:31.852 --> 00:31:37.615]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:31:37.615 --> 00:31:39.276]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:31:39.276 --> 00:31:40.556]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:31:40.556 --> 00:31:43.237]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:31:43.237 --> 00:31:44.658]  He explains everything you need to know.
[00:31:44.918 --> 00:31:47.260]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:32:01.815 --> 00:32:08.860]  Alex has told you that the Mideast uprisings over food prices and shortages caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide.
[00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:11.522]  We're seeing the impact right here in the United States.
[00:32:11.522 --> 00:32:20.568]  Ethanol, that was supposed to reduce petroleum use and fuel prices, hit a 30-month high in February, and pump prices are expected to reach $5 a gallon.
[00:32:20.568 --> 00:32:27.192]  Because of shipping costs, food is being priced out of the reach of millions of Americans, with an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days.
[00:32:27.192 --> 00:32:27.493]  Move quickly!
[00:32:29.434 --> 00:32:29.774]  I think so.
[00:33:00.708 --> 00:33:01.308]  We've got it.
[00:33:01.308 --> 00:33:07.833]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:33:07.833 --> 00:33:12.235]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:12.235 --> 00:33:14.217]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:14.217 --> 00:33:20.200]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:22.002]  Are we seeing the earth?
[00:33:22.002 --> 00:33:24.183]  We've got it.
[00:33:24.183 --> 00:33:27.985]  Are we seeing the earth now?
[00:33:27.985 --> 00:33:29.446]  We've got it.
[00:33:35.755 --> 00:33:51.066]  Okay, Fox News is now reporting that the cooling has failed, and the emergency levers have failed at Fukushima, and they're now accelerating the evacuation area.
[00:33:51.066 --> 00:33:55.009]  Fox News is now reporting that Japan quaked U.S.
[00:33:55.009 --> 00:33:56.951]  Charter's planes to help citizens leave.
[00:33:57.935 --> 00:34:02.339]  Again, government corporations push cover up a Japanese nuclear nightmare.
[00:34:02.339 --> 00:34:15.950]  USA Today confirmed our report today that indeed the Japanese are not releasing the real radiation levels for several hundred mile circumference around Fukushima disaster site.
[00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:18.151]  We have all of those reports.
[00:34:18.151 --> 00:34:23.316]  We also have the Star out of Canada reporting that there is a
[00:34:25.523 --> 00:34:28.965]  Demineralized water leak from the Pickering Nuclear Station.
[00:34:28.965 --> 00:34:31.647]  They're saying it's no threat.
[00:34:31.647 --> 00:34:37.151]  Up in Canada, Pickering Nuclear Plant leaked radioactive water, is the AFP headline.
[00:34:37.151 --> 00:34:43.955]  Thousands of liters of radioactive water have been released into Lake Ontario as a result of an accident at a Canadian nuclear power plant.
[00:34:43.955 --> 00:34:45.996]  According to authorities, the event was a low-level
[00:34:46.997 --> 00:34:48.359]  Regulatory event.
[00:34:48.359 --> 00:34:51.101]  Oh, since they said regulatory, it's okay.
[00:34:51.101 --> 00:34:57.868]  With only negligible effect to the environment and no public health implications, Ontario Power said in a statement.
[00:34:57.868 --> 00:35:04.055]  So, just like they said at Three Mile Island, same type of garbage on that front.
[00:35:06.187 --> 00:35:07.188]  I don't have that.
[00:35:07.188 --> 00:35:07.928]  Thank you so much.
[00:35:37.674 --> 00:35:40.995]  We do have a Dr. Chris Busby joining us.
[00:35:40.995 --> 00:35:48.239]  He's a British scientist and activist known for his work on the health effects of ionizing radiation, in addition to his academic appointments.
[00:35:48.239 --> 00:35:55.202]  Busby was the National Speaker of the Science Technology and the Scientific Secretary of the European Committee on Radiation Risk.
[00:35:55.202 --> 00:35:57.403]  He's a chemist.
[00:35:58.536 --> 00:36:01.018]  And he will be joining us.
[00:36:01.018 --> 00:36:11.387]  He also has a PhD from the University of Kent in researching Raman Spectroelectrochemistry or dealing with the effects of radiation.
[00:36:11.387 --> 00:36:16.051]  So he's a radiation poisoning specialist in chemistry and radiology.
[00:36:16.051 --> 00:36:17.752]  He will be joining us.
[00:36:18.753 --> 00:36:25.857]  He's also one of the advisors to the BBC on nuclear power plant accidents and incidents.
[00:36:25.857 --> 00:36:32.480]  He'll be joining us coming up right before I went live for this latest segment.
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:41.104]  I was given some bombshell news and information dealing with Fox reporting that the cooling has failed in the emergency effort.
[00:36:41.704 --> 00:36:57.530]  So maybe we should just go to the front page of Fox News to see that information right now, because I was given that two seconds before I walked in here and actually catching my breath dealing with that information right now.
[00:36:57.530 --> 00:37:06.393]  But we'll continue to collate all this information and post it at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[00:37:08.097 --> 00:37:11.560]  There's also a lot of other news on the economic front.
[00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:13.081]  There's also a lot of U.S.
[00:37:13.081 --> 00:37:17.605]  news and Middle East news we're gonna be breaking down.
[00:37:17.605 --> 00:37:20.547]  There's the headline, Confusion Over Nuke Cooling Mission.
[00:37:20.547 --> 00:37:33.838]  And it says, Photos Give an Inside Look at the Crippled Nuclear Plant as Japanese Officials Appear at Odds Over Weather Helicopter and Water Cannon Dumps on the Earthquake Ravaged Facilities Have Been Effective.
[00:37:33.838 --> 00:37:36.661]  Here's the headline, Japanese Officials at Odds of Water Dumps Have
[00:37:37.521 --> 00:37:37.862]  I think?
[00:37:54.642 --> 00:38:08.278]  A spokesman for the Tokyo Electric Power Company told Japan news agency NHK that it appears the mission was successful, while a spokesman for the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency says the water cannons failed in their attempt to cool the unit.
[00:38:08.278 --> 00:38:09.840]  There are still reports of smoke and fire.
[00:38:10.942 --> 00:38:14.307]  Uh, when the water failed to reach its target from safe distances.
[00:38:14.307 --> 00:38:19.034]  Japanese military helicopters dumped water onto the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant.
[00:38:19.034 --> 00:38:21.117]  I mean, when they pumped seawater in, that didn't work.
[00:38:21.117 --> 00:38:22.719]  With masses amount of it.
[00:38:22.719 --> 00:38:23.861]  Little helicopter dumps?
[00:38:23.861 --> 00:38:24.722]  I don't think it's gonna work.
[00:38:24.722 --> 00:38:25.203]  I hope it does.
[00:38:26.374 --> 00:38:31.217]  They went on to say crews tried unsuccessfully to douse the reactors with water.
[00:38:31.217 --> 00:38:39.741]  An official from the Tokyo Electric Power Company told Japan News that there is a greater possibility they will be able to fill the spent fuel rod pool from Unit 3 reactor.
[00:38:39.741 --> 00:38:47.926]  The pool requires 1,200 tons of water to be filled, but the power company official says you only need one-third of the amount to cover the spent fuel rods.
[00:38:47.926 --> 00:38:51.428]  But what about the hundreds of thousands splattered everywhere from the explosion?
[00:38:51.428 --> 00:38:54.690]  They're covering up the radiation levels!
[00:38:55.849 --> 00:39:10.594]  Our supposed military that's really there to guard the foreign banks when they loot us and rob us and take our pension funds and to suppress the states under the John Warren Defense Authorization Act if we try to take the country back legally and lawfully and constitutionally.
[00:39:10.594 --> 00:39:13.815]  They're not telling us what the radiation levels are.
[00:39:13.815 --> 00:39:17.036]  Not just the Japanese government.
[00:39:17.036 --> 00:39:19.717]  Not just Tokyo Power and Electric.
[00:39:20.831 --> 00:39:23.453]  They are not telling us.
[00:39:23.453 --> 00:39:24.974]  I called Congress yesterday.
[00:39:24.974 --> 00:39:26.375]  I called the White House.
[00:39:26.375 --> 00:39:27.416]  I was hung up on.
[00:39:27.416 --> 00:39:29.558]  They don't want to hear it.
[00:39:29.558 --> 00:39:36.183]  All I'm hearing about on our news is March madness as six days of radiation clouds make their way.
[00:39:36.883 --> 00:39:40.324]  The first stuff that's going to hit us is from the small leaks Friday.
[00:39:40.324 --> 00:39:43.486]  Not the explosion Saturday at Fukushima 1.
[00:39:43.486 --> 00:39:45.987]  Not the explosion Monday at Fukushima 3.
[00:39:45.987 --> 00:39:50.448]  Not the explosions on Tuesday at Fukushima 2 and 4.
[00:39:50.448 --> 00:39:53.249]  Not the spent fuel rods splattered into the atmosphere.
[00:39:53.249 --> 00:39:54.250]  Do you read me?
[00:39:56.069 --> 00:39:59.530]  And I've sent the Twitter question out, twitter.com forward slash realalexjones.
[00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:03.611]  If you want to follow us there, send us any intel.
[00:40:03.611 --> 00:40:10.633]  I've read the mainstream news articles on air where meteorologists were particularly worried that the jet stream happened to be coming in at the time when the radiation reaches the U.S.
[00:40:10.633 --> 00:40:12.814]  in Southern California, in the L.A.
[00:40:12.814 --> 00:40:14.854]  area where the mountains block.
[00:40:14.854 --> 00:40:21.516]  If you look at the normal activity of that jet stream coming in, where the jet stream bands around over Japan to the U.S.,
[00:40:22.808 --> 00:40:28.615]  It hits Southern California and turns up and runs up the coast because the mountains block it.
[00:40:28.615 --> 00:40:38.866]  It comes in at a high altitude and lowers down to about 10,000 feet and meteorologists have pointed out and radiologists that it will dump in and will concentrate over Los Angeles.
[00:40:38.866 --> 00:40:40.568]  Now, I said that days ago.
[00:40:41.508 --> 00:40:43.190]  Our guest said that days ago.
[00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:51.638]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, USA Today and the New York Times are both reporting exactly what we said.
[00:40:51.638 --> 00:41:04.751]  But with this background statement of you don't need potassium iodide and people being blocked from getting it when it does cover you with one of the number one things thrown off by these reactors, what we know has been released in massive amounts, radioactive iodine.
[00:41:05.845 --> 00:41:11.309]  Coming up in 20 minutes, we have a top radiation poisoning expert joining us.
[00:41:11.309 --> 00:41:15.692]  Great job, by the way, to the crew for getting that information.
[00:41:15.692 --> 00:41:18.894]  Here's what some of the Twitter commenters are saying.
[00:41:18.894 --> 00:41:26.519]  ODAI1011 says, I would definitely evacuate Southern California.
[00:41:26.519 --> 00:41:31.383]  David Hanby says, in the next few days, Southern California will become a very bad place to be.
[00:41:32.773 --> 00:41:34.734]  But see, they almost make it like it's kooky to warn people.
[00:41:34.734 --> 00:41:36.874]  Should I even call Charlie Sheen up and people I know in L.A.
[00:41:36.874 --> 00:41:37.835]  and tell them about the news?
[00:41:37.835 --> 00:41:40.255]  I'm sure they're already reading Infowars and Prison Planet.
[00:41:40.255 --> 00:41:42.196]  Have a talk to him in a few days.
[00:41:42.196 --> 00:41:45.617]  In the next few days, Southern California will be a very bad place to be.
[00:41:45.617 --> 00:41:48.658]  Another one from Pablo Guerra.
[00:41:48.658 --> 00:41:50.158]  I think you're overreacting, Alex.
[00:41:50.158 --> 00:41:53.980]  Japan is way too far away from California.
[00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:58.441]  Well, sir, go to Paul Joseph Watson's article, U.S.
[00:41:58.441 --> 00:42:00.622]  Government Cannot Be Trusted on Radiation Plume.
[00:42:01.502 --> 00:42:09.648]  With a government released graph years ago of what radiation detectors picked up in just the 10 days after Chernobyl.
[00:42:09.648 --> 00:42:15.953]  All of Western Europe, much of Eastern Europe and Russia covered.
[00:42:15.953 --> 00:42:24.140]  There is the New York Times slash Reuters graphic put together with information by the US Weather Service.
[00:42:25.575 --> 00:42:29.137]  The Department of Energy and the United Nations.
[00:42:29.137 --> 00:42:33.719]  And you see the plume reaching with orange level.
[00:42:33.719 --> 00:42:34.579]  Orange level!
[00:42:34.579 --> 00:42:37.120]  The highest is red, then orange.
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:38.841]  It's got a graph of the rads there.
[00:42:38.841 --> 00:42:40.622]  In fact, roll down so I can read it, please.
[00:42:40.622 --> 00:42:41.842]  I actually have it printed out in front of me.
[00:42:41.842 --> 00:42:45.604]  Thank you.
[00:42:45.604 --> 00:42:47.945]  Relative levels of radiation.
[00:42:49.403 --> 00:43:01.556]  Red being high and dangerous, orange being somewhat dangerous with long-term exposure, yellow being moderate increases but not considered overall to be extremely life-threatening.
[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:13.069]  There you see orange and the darker yellow hitting Southern California with an orange blob right over Los Angeles.
[00:43:13.069 --> 00:43:14.651]  Why did the meteorologists say that?
[00:43:14.651 --> 00:43:23.900]  Because they've done pollution tests over and over again from the stuff that comes out of Chinese and Japanese coal-powered plants and other systems.
[00:43:24.861 --> 00:43:28.364]  And there's been big complaints about the fact that they don't have scrubbers in China.
[00:43:28.364 --> 00:43:30.446]  Same jet stream goes over China than Japan.
[00:43:30.446 --> 00:43:37.512]  They're always picking up high levels of lead, arsenic, other things from the dirty coal plants hitting and building up.
[00:43:37.512 --> 00:43:41.295]  It comes in out of the Pacific and hits those mountains and dumps into LA.
[00:43:41.295 --> 00:43:43.517]  Everybody knows that!
[00:43:43.517 --> 00:43:46.520]  There's the New York Times Reuters graphic.
[00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:50.123]  An orange dot directly over Los Angeles.
[00:43:51.343 --> 00:43:56.005]  And they then show it going on in to the Rockies and over Colorado.
[00:43:56.005 --> 00:43:58.766]  I watch the jet stream live time and satellite feeds.
[00:43:58.766 --> 00:44:00.326]  We've shown them to you here.
[00:44:00.326 --> 00:44:05.248]  And generally, it hits and turns up the coast, running up that mountain range into Canada.
[00:44:05.248 --> 00:44:07.609]  So I don't know why they're showing that.
[00:44:07.609 --> 00:44:10.990]  To me, it doesn't... I'm not going to argue with their meteorologists.
[00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:13.031]  The point is that
[00:44:14.761 --> 00:44:15.721]  Okay, I'm overreacting.
[00:44:15.721 --> 00:44:16.242]  You know what?
[00:44:16.242 --> 00:44:21.344]  I'll tell you something, Pablo Guerra, Fuster, I hope that you are 100% right.
[00:44:21.344 --> 00:44:23.064]  Please, please be right, sir.
[00:44:23.064 --> 00:44:24.525]  I hope I'm wrong.
[00:44:24.525 --> 00:44:25.926]  I hope USA Today's wrong.
[00:44:25.926 --> 00:44:27.246]  I hope Reuters is wrong.
[00:44:27.246 --> 00:44:28.947]  I hope the New York Times is wrong.
[00:44:28.947 --> 00:44:29.687]  Okay?
[00:44:29.687 --> 00:44:34.469]  The fact is, they've been whitewashing how bad this is, and the Pentagon's got readings out to sea.
[00:44:34.469 --> 00:44:38.211]  That's why the aircraft carriers raced away Monday when the Mark 1 Fukushima No.
[00:44:38.211 --> 00:44:38.571]  3 blew up.
[00:44:40.845 --> 00:44:41.445]  Here's another one.
[00:44:41.445 --> 00:44:48.110]  I would start a plan to stay out on the other side of the Rockies for a bit.
[00:44:48.110 --> 00:44:51.513]  That is west of the Rockies.
[00:44:51.513 --> 00:44:56.717]  With that radiation coming in from the east to the west.
[00:44:56.717 --> 00:44:59.399]  Look, I don't know what to say at this point.
[00:44:59.399 --> 00:45:00.359]  I love my children.
[00:45:00.359 --> 00:45:02.121]  I try to do everything I can for them.
[00:45:02.121 --> 00:45:05.203]  I don't want them to be gone for two, three weeks.
[00:45:05.203 --> 00:45:07.224]  But I've looked at maps.
[00:45:07.224 --> 00:45:08.706]  Southern Caribbean's the place to be.
[00:45:09.915 --> 00:45:12.681]  I don't want to send my wife alone with my children.
[00:45:12.681 --> 00:45:18.093]  I've got to try to wrangle up somebody in the family that wants to go with them and chaperone them and help them.
[00:45:18.093 --> 00:45:18.814]  I'm going to stay here.
[00:45:20.233 --> 00:45:22.314]  And I haven't decided to do this yet.
[00:45:22.314 --> 00:45:23.414]  I don't have much time, though.
[00:45:23.414 --> 00:45:31.778]  Friday, Saturday, as the first radiation that was limited from Friday hits, they forecast, to try to gauge it.
[00:45:31.778 --> 00:45:38.800]  But we know what's coming from Saturday, and Sunday, and Monday, and Tuesday, and Wednesday, and Thursday, and Friday.
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:40.641]  It just keeps on a-coming.
[00:45:40.641 --> 00:45:44.483]  They estimate that for 10 days, there was off-gassing from Chernobyl.
[00:45:45.601 --> 00:45:56.227]  One million people, the New York Times estimates from the UN and the EU monitors, have died from cancers and leukemias associated with this.
[00:45:56.227 --> 00:46:01.510]  How will I feel 20 years from now if one or more of my children, and because of the U.S.
[00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:09.535]  did 300 above ground, the rest of the country's about 200, it's over 500 combined, according to the encyclopedia, according to Los Alamos Laboratory.
[00:46:09.535 --> 00:46:12.276]  Why do you think cancer's gone up so much since they did that?
[00:46:12.276 --> 00:46:12.917]  But a nuke,
[00:46:14.994 --> 00:46:19.257]  dissipates a lot of its radioactive isotopes.
[00:46:19.257 --> 00:46:22.179]  A reactor is far worse.
[00:46:22.179 --> 00:46:25.642]  And people are saying, hey, Japan's thousands of miles away.
[00:46:25.642 --> 00:46:40.874]  Don't you understand that they've had plants blowing up sky high, 3,000 feet or more, and then drifting tens of thousands of feet on the news, out to sea, smoking now for six days towards us.
[00:46:40.874 --> 00:46:43.316]  Don't you understand that they, I told everybody,
[00:46:44.369 --> 00:46:48.654]  On 9-11, the news said, there's nothing wrong with the dust, it's safe.
[00:46:48.654 --> 00:46:48.774]  On 9-12, 2001.
[00:46:48.774 --> 00:46:48.794]  9-13.
[00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:58.915]  The head of the EPA, Christina Todd Whitman, came out and said, the air is safe to breathe, we've done the test.
[00:46:58.915 --> 00:47:19.872]  Now it turned out, three years later, it got released via lawsuits that they knew it was deadly, that she said, we've got to tell people to stay out of here for months, and they said, no, we're opening the schools, we're opening the stock market, and I remember going on air that day and the day after and saying, don't listen to them, you've got to have breathing apparatus, asbestos, lead, mercury, arsenic, all that stuff, and I got laughed at.
[00:47:20.592 --> 00:47:22.113]  And I'm being laughed at again.
[00:47:22.113 --> 00:47:24.516]  It's so funny to laugh at me.
[00:47:24.516 --> 00:47:28.119]  It's so funny to say, I can't see any radiation.
[00:47:29.730 --> 00:47:32.271]  It's not gonna reach here for the last six days.
[00:47:32.271 --> 00:47:33.491]  Shut up, Alex!
[00:47:33.491 --> 00:47:35.632]  It doesn't come across the Pacific Ocean.
[00:47:35.632 --> 00:47:48.495]  Now, the media and the government are having to cover their butts, their hind ends, and they're saying, yes, some is gonna get here, probably tomorrow, on the West Coast, coming in in Southern California.
[00:47:48.495 --> 00:47:53.437]  First place is gonna make landfall, but it's not a problem.
[00:47:53.437 --> 00:47:54.697]  Here's more Twitter comments.
[00:47:57.062 --> 00:48:02.444]  This is by Kittens Tasty.
[00:48:02.444 --> 00:48:06.966]  I would leave California.
[00:48:06.966 --> 00:48:09.206]  N-D-N-E-I-D-W-A.
[00:48:09.206 --> 00:48:10.347]  That's Washington.
[00:48:10.347 --> 00:48:13.508]  Heck, even the Northeast Coast.
[00:48:13.508 --> 00:48:16.549]  Here's Gail says, I'm in Santa Cruz, California.
[00:48:16.549 --> 00:48:18.750]  And I would if I could.
[00:48:20.433 --> 00:48:23.154]  Here's another one from Don Braxton.
[00:48:23.154 --> 00:48:23.814]  100% yes.
[00:48:23.814 --> 00:48:26.315]  I've warned my friends there and they just laughed.
[00:48:26.315 --> 00:48:29.157]  They can't say they weren't warned.
[00:48:29.157 --> 00:48:33.438]  Alex, if you are stuck in Los Angeles, what would you recommend?
[00:48:33.438 --> 00:48:34.679]  Stay indoors?
[00:48:34.679 --> 00:48:35.719]  Stay out of the rain?
[00:48:35.719 --> 00:48:37.480]  Absolutely.
[00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:39.021]  Just go search the term.
[00:48:39.021 --> 00:48:44.443]  We've got a top radiation expert about to join us with normal precautions, but you'd seal up your windows.
[00:48:45.527 --> 00:48:50.730]  You'd go ahead now and change today all the filters in your air conditioning system.
[00:48:50.730 --> 00:48:54.913]  Even though it won't be on, still it's coming in from the outside.
[00:48:54.913 --> 00:48:57.174]  That's a system that's got off vents to the outside.
[00:48:57.174 --> 00:48:58.115]  I would close your doors.
[00:48:59.192 --> 00:49:01.273]  When this stuff makes landfall, hope it blows over.
[00:49:01.273 --> 00:49:03.053]  You see, it's when it's coming in, it's so dangerous.
[00:49:03.053 --> 00:49:05.034]  Once it hits the dirt, it gets diluted.
[00:49:05.034 --> 00:49:08.615]  You still got a chance of breathing it later, but it's a lot lower chance.
[00:49:08.615 --> 00:49:10.076]  It's when it's coming in.
[00:49:10.076 --> 00:49:22.040]  You're outside in Southern California when this makes landfall or on the West Coast period, it's splattered all over because the winds are blowing to the north, east, southeast, and back to east now.
[00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:24.201]  So it's going to be just shooting all over the Pacific.
[00:49:26.222 --> 00:49:44.469]  If I'm standing here at Fukushima looking out east towards the United States western seaboard in the lower 48, the wind was first going to the north, then it was going straight east, then it was going southeast, it's now been for two days back east.
[00:49:44.469 --> 00:49:49.251]  It's just blowing, blowing, blowing, blowing, blowing, blowing, blowing.
[00:49:50.114 --> 00:49:57.437]  We had just smoke going up, full of radiation up into the sky, admitted high levels, but they won't say how high.
[00:49:57.437 --> 00:50:06.041]  We've gotten reports from on aircraft carriers that Monday when Fukushima-1-3 blew up, that the detectors just went off the charts, but the Pentagon's not releasing that.
[00:50:06.041 --> 00:50:09.082]  They're not telling us exactly what's coming our way.
[00:50:09.082 --> 00:50:11.183]  They're not telling us how to take precautions.
[00:50:11.183 --> 00:50:15.185]  They're saying radiation's coming because they know private detectors are going to pick it up.
[00:50:15.185 --> 00:50:17.086]  And so they're saying, don't worry about it.
[00:50:18.885 --> 00:50:38.257]  Go out, enjoy yourself, have a great day, and yes, if it rains Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, into next week, as long as these things burn, as long as they explode, as long as the meltdowns continue, and they say the big meltdowns could be coming, the total meltdowns of the contained cores, two of which have already been breached, they say, who knows what's going on.
[00:50:38.257 --> 00:50:42.980]  What they admit is horrible.
[00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:44.041]  Ah, it makes me mad!
[00:50:45.011 --> 00:50:47.976]  Just sit here and watch how we've been trained to live in denial.
[00:50:47.976 --> 00:50:49.759]  Eh, fluoride's good for you in the water.
[00:50:49.759 --> 00:50:50.840]  Eh, GMO's good for you.
[00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:52.323]  Eh, aspartame's good for you.
[00:50:52.323 --> 00:50:53.685]  Corn syrup's good for you.
[00:50:53.685 --> 00:50:55.668]  Eh, uranium, plutonium.
[00:50:55.668 --> 00:50:57.571]  Little bit of it's good for your bones.
[00:50:57.571 --> 00:50:58.533]  You know?
[00:50:58.533 --> 00:50:59.595]  I like to glow in the dark.
[00:51:01.673 --> 00:51:06.337]  We all know that Berkey Water Purification Systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:02.844]  America, you've been warned.
[00:52:08.084 --> 00:52:10.425]  That will shake the very foundations of our nation.
[00:52:10.425 --> 00:52:13.806]  We've told you about the video that details this shocking prediction.
[00:52:13.806 --> 00:52:17.467]  So far, over 6 million people have watched this free video online.
[00:52:17.467 --> 00:52:18.287]  Have you?
[00:52:18.287 --> 00:52:21.868]  Again, this big event has nothing to do with war or the stock market.
[00:52:21.868 --> 00:52:24.369]  Yet, it could change everything about your normal way of life.
[00:52:24.369 --> 00:52:29.590]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your family.
[00:52:29.590 --> 00:52:30.770]  Could this really happen?
[00:52:30.770 --> 00:52:34.751]  Well, the man who created this video has been right about many predictions in his career.
[00:52:34.751 --> 00:52:36.692]  He was among the first to predict the collapse of G.E.
[00:52:43.171 --> 00:52:43.551]  I don't know.
[00:53:01.343 --> 00:53:02.643]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:53:02.643 --> 00:53:08.245]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:53:08.245 --> 00:53:13.247]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:53:13.247 --> 00:53:13.727]  It's true.
[00:53:13.727 --> 00:53:18.289]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:53:18.829 --> 00:53:24.050]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:53:24.050 --> 00:53:31.152]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:53:31.152 --> 00:53:32.272]  And here's the best part.
[00:53:32.272 --> 00:53:38.634]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:53:38.954 --> 00:53:42.157]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:53:42.157 --> 00:53:44.378]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:53:44.378 --> 00:53:45.319]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:53:45.319 --> 00:53:45.719]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:53:45.719 --> 00:53:48.962]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:53:48.962 --> 00:53:50.683]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:54:13.164 --> 00:54:25.782]  The Associated Press has been reporting since last night that NBC reporters, including one of their anchors, has tested positive for radiation.
[00:54:27.216 --> 00:54:34.498]  Bloomberg is reporting, and we're gonna get this up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, Tokyo passengers trigger U.S.
[00:54:34.498 --> 00:54:36.558]  airport detectors.
[00:54:36.558 --> 00:54:42.380]  New York Post is reporting radiation detectors at Dallas-Fort Worth and Chicago O'Hare.
[00:54:42.380 --> 00:54:44.580]  Remember, the military's worried about their personnel coming back.
[00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:49.221]  This stuff's so radioactive that they're carrying it on them.
[00:54:49.221 --> 00:54:52.062]  This is a huge disaster.
[00:54:52.062 --> 00:54:55.263]  600,000 rods blown sky high in every direction on fire.
[00:54:56.420 --> 00:54:58.241]  Okay?
[00:54:58.241 --> 00:55:01.262]  All blowing out towards us.
[00:55:01.262 --> 00:55:03.662]  But they'll tell you everything's fine.
[00:55:03.662 --> 00:55:11.605]  Radiation detectors at Dallas, Fort Worth and Chicago airports were triggered when passengers from flights that started in Tokyo passed through customs.
[00:55:11.605 --> 00:55:14.366]  The New York Post reported they got nuke detectors in there.
[00:55:15.472 --> 00:55:17.373]  They got all these multi-billion dollar containment systems.
[00:55:17.373 --> 00:55:22.594]  They have these public fear-mongering events where they do terror drills and everybody go out and get washed by the scrubbers to get the radiation off of them.
[00:55:44.460 --> 00:55:45.581]  You actually have radiation?
[00:55:45.581 --> 00:55:46.942]  Oh, the plane has it?
[00:55:46.942 --> 00:55:47.562]  Oh, your luggage?
[00:55:47.562 --> 00:55:49.144]  You're going through with it.
[00:55:49.144 --> 00:55:54.928]  We're not going to confiscate your luggage and do you a favor so you don't kill your kids when you get home with it.
[00:55:54.928 --> 00:55:57.410]  Yeah, they'll die a decade from now from it.
[00:55:57.410 --> 00:55:59.371]  You're going through with it.
[00:55:59.371 --> 00:56:02.794]  Yeah, when there's an actual real threat, what does government do?
[00:56:02.794 --> 00:56:03.374]  Nothing.
[00:56:03.374 --> 00:56:07.618]  It's all about fear-mongering with things that aren't a threat to train you to do whatever they say.
[00:56:08.991 --> 00:56:15.714]  Tested Dallas-Forth Worth, indicated low-level radiation in travelers' luggage and the aircraft's cabin filtration system.
[00:56:15.714 --> 00:56:17.694]  No passengers were quarantined, the newspaper said.
[00:56:17.694 --> 00:56:21.916]  What do you want to bet they put new passengers on those planes and have them take right back off?
[00:56:21.916 --> 00:56:24.157]  Don't want to panic, people!
[00:56:24.157 --> 00:56:28.318]  It wouldn't panic, folks, if you actually responded correctly to this, scrub those planes out.
[00:56:28.318 --> 00:56:31.640]  Details of the incident at O'Hare weren't immediately clear.
[00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:35.361]  Another incident in Chicago.
[00:56:35.361 --> 00:56:36.461]  So, there you have it.
[00:56:36.461 --> 00:56:37.762]  Bloomberg, New York Post,
[00:56:40.037 --> 00:56:46.538]  Obama, six days into this, is to make a statement about Japan later today.
[00:56:46.538 --> 00:56:48.539]  Oh, will you make a statement?
[00:56:48.539 --> 00:56:50.639]  I know everybody's calling the White House, that's good.
[00:56:50.639 --> 00:56:59.680]  Will you please make a statement about why the Pentagon hasn't released all the radiation monitor information from ships and bases in the area and aircraft we know have been flying through it?
[00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:08.142]  They lied yesterday and said a spy plane might fly through it today and get some heat signature photos to find out what's going on.
[00:57:10.455 --> 00:57:13.517]  This is absolutely incredible.
[00:57:13.517 --> 00:57:16.219]  This is absolutely amazing that this is all going on.
[00:57:16.219 --> 00:57:19.981]  Listeners have asked us to try to secure the medical grade potassium iodate.
[00:57:19.981 --> 00:57:28.186]  We have found a source that it turns out I've known for more than a decade here in Texas, and my folks are dispatched there now to try to get a large amount of it.
[00:57:28.186 --> 00:57:29.407]  The place is small.
[00:57:29.407 --> 00:57:32.289]  It's a big outfit, but they've been swamped by so many calls.
[00:57:33.209 --> 00:57:33.529]  All right.
[00:57:56.869 --> 00:57:57.890]  Read the insert.
[00:57:57.890 --> 00:58:03.634]  That's up to you to make the decision because it does have some side effects on its own and some people are allergic to iodine.
[00:58:03.634 --> 00:58:07.577]  But you know if you're allergic to iodine because you eat fish, you get sick.
[00:58:07.577 --> 00:58:09.659]  There's a lot of other ways to get high levels of iodine.
[00:58:09.659 --> 00:58:11.280]  Shellfish and things like that.
[00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:12.821]  I'm not going to tell you what to do.
[00:58:12.821 --> 00:58:13.542]  I know what I'm doing.
[00:58:15.251 --> 00:58:16.852]  So we're working on all of that as well.
[00:58:16.852 --> 00:58:20.514]  We're going to go ahead and get that guest on, Dr. Chris Busby, right now.
[00:58:20.514 --> 00:58:28.819]  We're going to come back with this radiation expert, who also advises the BBC on nuclear disasters, to tell us what we can expect in his forecast.
[00:58:28.819 --> 00:58:31.801]  We'll continue to break down all the latest developments as they unfold.
[00:58:31.801 --> 00:58:37.924]  And then Dr. Bob Bowman, three degrees in nuclear physics, will be joining us in the last 30 minutes of the third hour today.
[00:58:37.924 --> 00:58:38.625]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:47.067]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:47.067 --> 00:58:49.272]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:55.220 --> 00:58:56.500]  Tyranny is here.
[00:58:56.500 --> 00:59:00.422]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:59:00.422 --> 00:59:02.642]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:59:02.642 --> 00:59:08.524]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:59:08.524 --> 00:59:14.766]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:59:15.186 --> 00:59:21.127]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:59:21.127 --> 00:59:25.328]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:59:25.328 --> 00:59:29.629]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:59:29.629 --> 00:59:35.570]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:59:35.570 --> 00:59:39.130]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:59:39.130 --> 00:59:41.091]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:59:41.091 --> 00:59:41.531]  It's here.

[01:00:10.694 --> 01:00:12.294]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.294 --> 01:00:13.835]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.835 --> 01:00:18.018]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.018 --> 01:00:22.080]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.703 --> 01:00:30.765]  Dr. Doug Rockey, who wrote the handbook for the Army and the Pentagon on DU, has had over 30 surgeries from exposure to DU.
[01:00:30.765 --> 01:00:34.246]  He's unable to join us because of medical treatment in D.C.
[01:00:34.246 --> 01:00:34.966]  at the VA.
[01:00:34.966 --> 01:00:41.988]  He recommended those, and the number one person that knows even more than he does is Dr. Christopher Busby.
[01:00:41.988 --> 01:00:46.530]  He is a chemical chemist physicist.
[01:00:47.330 --> 01:00:47.670]  I don't know.
[01:01:09.944 --> 01:01:10.725]  Yes, hello.
[01:01:34.187 --> 01:01:37.809]  Well, the radiation from this plant, we don't know exactly how much there is.
[01:01:37.809 --> 01:01:42.711]  We've been plotting the plumes from the various releases.
[01:01:42.711 --> 01:01:51.154]  It's very hard to know how much is being released, but it's almost certain, in my opinion, that some of the pressure vessels at least have been breached.
[01:01:52.815 --> 01:01:53.176]  I think?
[01:02:22.875 --> 01:02:23.195]  I don't
[01:02:37.643 --> 01:02:37.964]  We're good.
[01:02:57.527 --> 01:02:59.629]  We're good to go.
[01:03:11.963 --> 01:03:12.384]  I think so.
[01:03:31.324 --> 01:03:32.105]  We're good to go.
[01:03:52.606 --> 01:04:17.537]  So what's going to happen is it's going to, if nothing gets worse, there'll be just continuous releases of radioactivity from the fuel ponds and from the reactors themselves and when the wind, and of course you know the wind is generally westerly although it will be moving around a lot, the plumes will eventually come across America and then it will come across the Atlantic and come across to Europe and like Chernobyl they will go all around the world's circulation.
[01:04:17.537 --> 01:04:19.698]  The concentrations at the moment probably won't be
[01:04:19.738 --> 01:04:20.718]  Doctor, doctor, we've got a break.
[01:04:20.718 --> 01:04:21.078]  Stay there.
[01:04:21.078 --> 01:04:23.959]  I want you to recap and repeat all that.
[01:04:23.959 --> 01:04:27.081]  Talk about some of the other isotopes that are being released.
[01:04:27.081 --> 01:04:32.983]  That's what Dr. Bob Bowman said three days ago, is that Geiger counters only pick up a certain spectrum of this.
[01:04:48.328 --> 01:04:56.253]  And we also know the Japanese, USA Today has confirmed, are covering up the true radiation readings just with the regular Geiger counters.
[01:04:56.253 --> 01:04:58.914]  And so the Pentagon also has assets there.
[01:04:58.914 --> 01:05:01.556]  They're covering up as well.
[01:05:01.556 --> 01:05:08.219]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:05:08.219 --> 01:05:13.362]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:05:13.362 --> 01:05:15.224]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[01:05:17.421 --> 01:05:28.492]  Well they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit
[01:05:30.438 --> 01:05:35.159]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:05:35.159 --> 01:05:39.001]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[01:05:39.001 --> 01:05:40.241]  Others don't.
[01:05:40.241 --> 01:05:42.382]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:05:42.382 --> 01:05:44.162]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:05:44.162 --> 01:05:47.043]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:05:47.043 --> 01:05:53.665]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.

[01:05:56.366 --> 01:05:58.747]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[01:05:58.747 --> 01:05:59.247]  Others don't.
[01:06:00.762 --> 01:06:05.305]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[01:06:05.305 --> 01:06:06.226]  Number one.
[01:06:06.226 --> 01:06:09.648]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:06:09.648 --> 01:06:10.509]  Number two.
[01:06:10.509 --> 01:06:15.392]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:06:15.392 --> 01:06:16.132]  It's true.
[01:06:16.132 --> 01:06:21.016]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:06:21.016 --> 01:06:21.836]  Number three.
[01:06:21.836 --> 01:06:25.418]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:06:25.418 --> 01:06:29.121]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:06:29.321 --> 01:06:30.122]  Number 4.
[01:06:30.122 --> 01:06:32.885]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:06:32.885 --> 01:06:36.569]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:06:36.569 --> 01:06:37.349]  Number 5.
[01:06:37.349 --> 01:06:41.494]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:06:41.494 --> 01:06:46.259]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:07:58.976 --> 01:08:01.637]  Thank you.
[01:08:01.637 --> 01:08:04.398]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:04.398 --> 01:08:07.179]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:29.993 --> 01:08:39.761]  Professor Christopher Busby comes highly recommended by Dr. Doug Rockey, who literally wrote the book for the Pentagon on DU effects.
[01:08:39.761 --> 01:08:43.744]  And he is a professor, a doctor of chemical physics.
[01:08:43.744 --> 01:08:44.665]  He is one of the leading
[01:08:45.405 --> 01:08:52.608]  Experts in the world in studying the effects of radiation exposure fallout.
[01:08:52.608 --> 01:09:00.892]  He's one of the chief advisors there for the BBC for his assessment of the radiation danger following the earthquake tsunami in Japan.
[01:09:00.892 --> 01:09:08.515]  He joins us for the next 40 minutes and if you missed the last segment he was talking about tritium being the number one thing
[01:09:08.775 --> 01:09:09.116]  That's
[01:09:25.379 --> 01:09:25.659]  I think?
[01:09:45.510 --> 01:09:50.478]  All over the Pacific, all over South Korea, is not giving us any data.
[01:09:50.478 --> 01:09:58.030]  USA Today confirms that Japan is not releasing the radiation readings from two of the regions or the states.
[01:10:00.464 --> 01:10:03.226]  The prefectures, as they call them.
[01:10:03.226 --> 01:10:11.312]  So please cover that spectrum first, then let's get into the fallout and the fact that a lot of this cannot be easily measured.
[01:10:11.312 --> 01:10:16.136]  Does the government then have, that's a lot of questions, have systems to be able to measure that?
[01:10:17.755 --> 01:10:20.378]  Right, there's rather a lot of things, but I'll try and cover those.
[01:10:20.378 --> 01:10:33.831]  The late Professor John Goffman, who was an advisor to the Atomic Energy Commission in America, a very senior man, said in the 1980s that the nuclear industry is waging a war against humanity.
[01:10:33.831 --> 01:10:37.654]  And this is another battle in that war.
[01:10:37.654 --> 01:10:39.676]  It's a battle for the truth.
[01:10:39.676 --> 01:10:41.278]  After Chernobyl, there was a
[01:10:41.858 --> 01:10:42.499]  We're good to go.
[01:11:02.958 --> 01:11:08.540]  The material coming out of the Fukushima site can be measured.
[01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:18.083]  Many colleagues of mine are measuring increased radioactivity as far away as Tokyo, which is some 150 kilometers south.
[01:11:18.083 --> 01:11:22.464]  And we have been plotting, using the supercomputer, the NOAA in America,
[01:11:23.104 --> 01:11:23.845]  We're good to go.
[01:11:48.131 --> 01:11:48.831]  We're good to go.
[01:12:16.304 --> 01:12:30.890]  But it doesn't relate to internal radiation, and I'm sure you know from what Doug Rockey has been telling you that it's the internal radiation effects of uranium particles which are responsible for all these terrible things that are happening in Iraq and to the Gulf War veterans.
[01:12:30.890 --> 01:12:34.091]  And the same situation is developing here.
[01:12:34.091 --> 01:12:42.215]  The smoke that you see coming off in the pictures from those reactors, from the Fukushima reactors and from the fuel ponds where they're overheating and boiling,
[01:12:42.935 --> 01:12:45.616]  It's smoke consisting of radioactive particles.
[01:12:45.616 --> 01:12:49.557]  These particles are invisible once they get into the air and they float about the place.
[01:12:49.557 --> 01:12:53.818]  They're not detected at all by Geiger counters because they are alpha emitters.
[01:12:53.818 --> 01:13:00.540]  In the case of tritium, it's a liquid gas just like water and it's a beta emitter, not detected either by Geiger counters.
[01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:12.483]  So if there's a little increase in the millisieverts that are being measured in some place, you may be sure that associated with that is a very large number of very small particles that you will be inhaling and that will certainly
[01:13:12.523 --> 01:13:13.563]  We're good to go.
[01:13:38.815 --> 01:13:42.078]  What is giant profits worth if your children die of cancer?
[01:13:42.078 --> 01:13:44.721]  What is the whole world worth if you lose your soul?
[01:13:57.794 --> 01:13:58.555]  I agree with you.
[01:13:58.555 --> 01:14:13.326]  I mean, it's worse than that because I've been studying in this regard the health effects in Iraq and in the Middle East, and those depleted uranium particles which float around the world are most concentrated in that area.
[01:14:13.326 --> 01:14:22.073]  And a study was carried out a year or two ago in Jerusalem which showed that the sperm count in the Israeli men was falling rapidly.
[01:14:22.073 --> 01:14:27.517]  And these people predicted, in this scientific paper, they predicted that if this continued
[01:14:27.657 --> 01:14:28.137]  We're good.
[01:14:50.228 --> 01:14:59.510]  55 when they started atomic testing right through to Chernobyl and the releases from nuclear power stations which we know cause childhood leukemia.
[01:14:59.510 --> 01:15:08.031]  These are, if you like, just the outward signs of something that's happening to the genetic makeup of the human race and the fertility will go down and down and down.
[01:15:08.031 --> 01:15:11.712]  There'll be more and more cancers and eventually we will have polished ourselves off.
[01:15:11.712 --> 01:15:17.753]  And all because the nuclear industry wants to make money and people invest in uranium shares and they're determined to ensure
[01:15:17.953 --> 01:15:21.635]  Doctor, let me back up what you're saying here.
[01:15:21.635 --> 01:15:22.695]  I've seen numbers in Western Europe
[01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:50.629]  And the maps, as you pointed out, major studies, not just in Israel, but in Western Europe, France, the United States, Canada, who have a lot of nuclear reactors, Japan, we see an 85 to 87% sperm fertility drop.
[01:15:50.629 --> 01:15:52.470]  The sperm don't have tails.
[01:15:52.470 --> 01:15:55.492]  They don't have proper heads.
[01:15:55.492 --> 01:15:58.633]  Their genetics are very seriously damaged.
[01:15:58.633 --> 01:16:01.075]  And just CBS News reported a few months ago,
[01:16:01.855 --> 01:16:12.585]  All over Tennessee, Texas, wherever they've had these big nuclear weapons production facilities or the rod production facilities, clearly it's leaking into the water.
[01:16:12.585 --> 01:16:16.168]  And that's another reason not just the 500 plus above air test.
[01:16:16.929 --> 01:16:17.310]  I don't
[01:16:37.290 --> 01:16:46.977]  AFP and they say they released radioactive water into the lake in Canada in Ontario, but they say this is not a problem.
[01:16:46.977 --> 01:16:48.938]  I mean, it's just ongoing.
[01:16:48.938 --> 01:16:50.960]  These people are killing us.
[01:16:52.130 --> 01:16:53.891]  Well, you have to ask yourself why.
[01:16:53.891 --> 01:17:02.135]  I mean, are they just stupid, or is it perhaps... I mean, there are people who believe that this is some method of trying to control the number of people on Earth.
[01:17:02.135 --> 01:17:03.416]  My own feeling is it's not that.
[01:17:03.416 --> 01:17:04.496]  I think they are just stupid.
[01:17:04.496 --> 01:17:08.498]  I've met these people at the very highest level on government committees.
[01:17:08.498 --> 01:17:10.479]  They have a very curious way of seeing the world.
[01:17:10.479 --> 01:17:12.200]  They try to see the world through mathematics.
[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:13.461]  That's the problem.
[01:17:13.461 --> 01:17:14.101]  And if it's
[01:17:18.183 --> 01:17:19.023]  We're good to go.
[01:17:45.055 --> 01:17:46.355]  Disconnected problems.
[01:17:46.355 --> 01:17:51.297]  They don't seem to be able to put all of these things together to get to any reasonable conclusion.
[01:17:51.297 --> 01:17:52.937]  Physics is like that, you know.
[01:17:52.937 --> 01:18:00.739]  What it does is it tries to isolate problems in the laboratory and take away all the second order effects and look at them under a microscope and then come to some conclusions.
[01:18:00.739 --> 01:18:05.220]  But the problem is that you can't then put all those facts back together and get back to reality.
[01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:22.419]  Well, reality, as you know, Doctor, and the globalists even admit this is one of the problems with their system, they're looking at one simple system and the effect that that's going to have, and not all the butterfly effects and endless ripple effects as it connects into everything else.
[01:18:23.380 --> 01:18:27.543]  You give the example of the sperm count in Israel alone.
[01:18:27.543 --> 01:18:37.831]  I mean, this is a fact, and it's just like Israel using DU in Lebanon four years ago, even though the wind is mainly blowing south right back on them.
[01:18:37.831 --> 01:18:43.636]  I mean, this is like a gun where you pull the trigger and it kills your enemy, but fires a delayed bullet right back at you.
[01:18:44.056 --> 01:19:02.363]  Absolutely, and we saw that in particular with the Gulf War, where the United States went in there and shot all that uranium all over the place, and then there was that huge increase in ill health, and also for infertility and congenital malformation in the children in their own population, in the soldiers who came back.
[01:19:02.363 --> 01:19:10.306]  It's quite extraordinary that they can continue to bury their heads in the sand and not recognize that they're destroying the human race.
[01:19:10.846 --> 01:19:15.791]  With all this nuclear radiation and the radionuclides that they're dissipating into the biosphere.
[01:19:15.791 --> 01:19:20.635]  I mean, it is truly appalling.
[01:19:20.635 --> 01:19:29.983]  We have, incidentally, managed to interview the main man in the International Commission on Radiological Protection, Dr. Jack Valentin.
[01:19:29.983 --> 01:19:32.765]  And this video is on Vimeo, if anyone wants to look at it.
[01:19:32.765 --> 01:19:37.169]  If they put in Valentin Busby on Google, they'll find it on Vimeo, they'll find the video.
[01:19:38.170 --> 01:19:39.271]  Hold on, Dr. Busby?
[01:19:39.271 --> 01:19:55.084]  I had an open meeting a year or so back, and this man, who is the Scientific Secretary of the International Commission on Radiological Protection, but who had just resigned at that point, met with me, and he admitted... Well, I tell you what, Dr. Busby, we gotta go to break.
[01:19:55.084 --> 01:19:55.945]  Stay right there.
[01:19:55.945 --> 01:20:00.669]  Come back and recap this key information you're giving us, then let's look at fallout precautions.
[01:20:01.693 --> 01:20:04.674]  If you suffer from poor sleep, you need MyPillow.
[01:20:04.674 --> 01:20:07.615]  Guaranteed to be the most comfortable pillow you will ever own.
[01:20:07.615 --> 01:20:13.638]  Using a patented fill, MyPillow adjusts to your exact individual needs by gently supporting your head, shoulders, and neck.
[01:20:13.638 --> 01:20:19.820]  MyPillow has a natural, built-in cooling effect, keeping your cervical nerves cool, giving you the best sleep of your life.
[01:20:19.820 --> 01:20:23.622]  MyPillow will never go flat and relieves snoring, migraines, sleep apnea,
[01:20:23.982 --> 01:20:24.262]  I think so.
[01:20:47.882 --> 01:20:50.166]  442-6199.
[01:20:50.166 --> 01:20:53.773]  Mention coupon code GCN and receive 20% off your order.
[01:20:53.773 --> 01:20:56.077]  What do you have to lose except poor sleep?
[01:20:56.077 --> 01:20:57.339]  MyPillow.com.
[01:20:57.339 --> 01:21:00.244]  The most comfortable pillow you will ever own, guaranteed.
[01:21:01.209 --> 01:21:03.551]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:21:03.551 --> 01:21:05.814]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:21:05.814 --> 01:21:09.137]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:21:09.137 --> 01:21:14.242]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:21:14.242 --> 01:21:18.446]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:21:18.746 --> 01:21:21.207]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:21:21.207 --> 01:21:23.968]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:21:23.968 --> 01:21:26.890]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:21:26.890 --> 01:21:34.493]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:21:34.833 --> 01:21:40.215]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:21:40.215 --> 01:21:43.055]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:21:43.055 --> 01:21:46.736]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:21:46.736 --> 01:21:47.817]  And I got news for you.
[01:21:47.817 --> 01:21:49.157]  You're everyone else.
[01:21:49.157 --> 01:21:50.658]  Invisible Empire.

[01:22:00.703 --> 01:22:04.908]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[01:22:04.908 --> 01:22:06.349]  dollar has been devaluating.
[01:22:06.349 --> 01:22:10.333]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[01:22:10.333 --> 01:22:13.056]  Is there a way to protect your portfolios from losing value?
[01:22:13.056 --> 01:22:15.038]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[01:22:15.038 --> 01:22:17.361]  They both have maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[01:22:18.382 --> 01:22:27.153]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them until now, your cash would have the buying power of only $4,800.
[01:22:27.153 --> 01:22:30.658]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[01:22:30.658 --> 01:22:33.742]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[01:22:33.962 --> 01:22:35.864]  Call John Ballman today at 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[01:22:35.864 --> 01:22:39.727]  Get all your questions answered before your money is worth zero.
[01:22:39.727 --> 01:22:40.508]  Call 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[01:22:40.508 --> 01:22:42.570]  Take action today while we still accept paper dollars for gold.
[01:22:42.570 --> 01:22:43.171]  That's 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[01:23:00.359 --> 01:23:02.440]  Daddy, I'm hungry.
[01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:03.960]  That little girl will get fed.
[01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:04.760]  For now.
[01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:07.861]  But what if people like Glenn Beck are right about the threats we face?
[01:23:07.861 --> 01:23:08.422]  If the U.S.
[01:23:08.422 --> 01:23:13.903]  dollar loses its status as the global reserve currency, prices on the things you need most will skyrocket.
[01:23:13.903 --> 01:23:16.224]  Food may be unaffordable, or worse, unavailable.
[01:23:16.644 --> 01:23:27.588]  Earthquakes, economic turmoil, continuing unemployment, rampant inflation, and even threats of terrorism are all reasons to let the experts at Ready Reserve Foods help you with a long-term food storage plan.
[01:23:27.588 --> 01:23:32.690]  Ready Reserve Foods has been a premier supplier of long-term storage foods for 37 years.
[01:23:32.690 --> 01:23:37.272]  Their unique process assures the highest quality long-term food storage available worldwide.
[01:23:37.272 --> 01:23:44.615]  Their products have a shelf life of 25 years, and a year's supply of quality food for two people only takes up about as much space as a refrigerator.
[01:23:44.815 --> 01:23:50.323]  For a fraction of what you now pay at the grocery store, you owe it to your family to find out more from Ready Reserve Foods.
[01:23:50.323 --> 01:23:52.667]  Call today for their free full-color catalog at 1-800-453-2202.
[01:23:52.667 --> 01:23:52.967]  That's 1-800-453-2202.
[01:24:04.847 --> 01:24:13.755]  Dr. Chris Busby is one of the leading chemical physicists in the world, one of the chief advisors to the BBC.
[01:24:13.755 --> 01:24:15.977]  He's also a professor.
[01:24:15.977 --> 01:24:19.700]  And Dr. Doug Rocky from Radiation Illness is too ill to come on.
[01:24:19.700 --> 01:24:22.343]  He has the toughest nails, 30-plus surgeries.
[01:24:22.343 --> 01:24:27.487]  Many of his team have died just cleaning up DU, which is, again, gets inside the body.
[01:24:27.487 --> 01:24:29.189]  But, Dr., long segment coming up.
[01:24:29.189 --> 01:24:29.950]  This one's short.
[01:24:31.871 --> 01:24:40.557]  You got cut off by the break trying to give out some videos that people can watch and a top government regulator admitting something to you.
[01:24:40.557 --> 01:24:41.158]  Please continue.
[01:24:48.883 --> 01:24:49.783]  We're good to go.
[01:25:13.848 --> 01:25:17.951]  And if you type in Busby Valentin, that's probably the easiest place to find it.
[01:25:17.951 --> 01:25:20.492]  Valentin is V-A-L-E-N-T-I-N.
[01:25:20.492 --> 01:25:22.333]  Anyway, on this... Sir, we'll post it.
[01:25:22.333 --> 01:25:24.755]  We'll post it on Infowars.com.
[01:25:24.755 --> 01:25:25.395]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:25:25.395 --> 01:25:25.955]  Okay.
[01:25:25.955 --> 01:25:40.324]  In this debate, in this talk that we had, he admitted that the risk model that's currently being used is inaccurate for internal radiation by a factor of up to 100 times, no, up to 900 times, 999 times, two orders of magnitude.
[01:25:40.324 --> 01:25:41.605]  And that's kind of what we're saying.
[01:25:42.125 --> 01:25:46.468]  So this would explain the effects from uranium that you see in the Gulf War.
[01:25:46.468 --> 01:25:53.072]  It would also predict that the exposures to the material from the Fukushima reactor will have a significant effect.
[01:25:53.072 --> 01:25:56.375]  You'll get increases in cancer, leukemia, all sorts of things.
[01:25:56.375 --> 01:25:59.357]  But they will be denied on the basis of the current risk model.
[01:25:59.357 --> 01:26:01.078]  That risk model is wrong.
[01:26:01.078 --> 01:26:02.419]  It's easy to show that it's wrong.
[01:26:02.759 --> 01:26:08.702]  And this is probably the greatest public health scandal of all time because that is the operative model since about 1955.
[01:26:08.702 --> 01:26:16.666]  And it's been there just to save the nuclear industry and enable it to continue to make bombs and nuclear power and all the other stuff.
[01:26:16.666 --> 01:26:28.313]  Doctor, many experts we've interviewed and many experts I see in the news are saying since Monday that this is a cover-up, that they believe meltdowns have already occurred, that the Japanese now admit that some of the cores, two of them, are exposed.
[01:26:28.313 --> 01:26:28.913]  What about the 640
[01:26:30.754 --> 01:26:44.049]  Plus 1,000 rods, they admit, were stored there, most of which were stored on top of the containment buildings and have been ejected into the atmosphere spectacularly when the Mark 1 MOX reactor at Reactor 3 blew up Monday.
[01:26:44.594 --> 01:26:46.515]  Yes, yes, absolutely.
[01:26:46.515 --> 01:26:47.916]  I agree with all of those things.
[01:26:47.916 --> 01:26:53.179]  In fact, I said this quite early on, on the British radio and television.
[01:26:53.179 --> 01:26:54.740]  I knew about the mocks.
[01:26:54.740 --> 01:27:00.724]  And, incidentally, what a curious and stupid place to put your spent fuel on top of the reactor.
[01:27:00.724 --> 01:27:05.447]  I mean, it's almost asking for trouble to put it right on top of the nuclear reactor.
[01:27:05.447 --> 01:27:11.891]  Actually, the amount of radioactive fuel outside these reactors is greater than the amount that's inside the reactors.
[01:27:13.711 --> 01:27:30.385]  And if that melts down, which it can do, incidentally, if the plutonium melts down, we could have a nuclear explosion like they did have in Mayak in 1957, the famous Kyshtym explosion, and that explosion created a wasteland of 350 square miles in Russia, which is still a wasteland.
[01:27:30.385 --> 01:27:32.627]  Break down that incident for those that aren't aware of it.
[01:27:33.930 --> 01:27:43.139]  In 1957, a waste tank in the Mayak facility exploded at Kyshtym in Russia, and we didn't find out for several years that this had happened.
[01:27:43.139 --> 01:27:54.650]  And it blew radioactive waste, plutonium and so forth, over an area of 350 square miles, I believe, and created a wasteland, which anybody can see in the Russian film Stalker.
[01:27:54.650 --> 01:27:55.211]  No, incidentally.
[01:27:55.211 --> 01:27:57.813]  The very famous film by Andrei Tarkovsky.
[01:27:57.813 --> 01:28:04.960]  The background for the stalker film is the wasteland of the MIAC facility, which is still fenced off and nobody can go in there because it's so radioactive.
[01:28:06.483 --> 01:28:07.484]  Unbelievable.
[01:28:07.484 --> 01:28:13.568]  And continuing, we're about to go to break, but what would you do if you were on the West Coast?
[01:28:13.568 --> 01:28:16.911]  Most of the models, New York Times, U.S.
[01:28:16.911 --> 01:28:26.798]  Department of Energy, NOAA that you mentioned, say that the main plume is going to hit Los Angeles and then turn north along the mountain range.
[01:28:26.798 --> 01:28:29.620]  And that's just the first leakage from Friday.
[01:28:29.620 --> 01:28:31.562]  Days behind that is the more intense
[01:28:32.222 --> 01:28:39.109]  We've already put a signal out on the Low Level Radiation Campaign website, llrc.org.
[01:28:39.109 --> 01:28:40.990]  We're monitoring the situation.
[01:28:40.990 --> 01:28:46.756]  What we tell people to do is you have to stay inside, you have to drink bottled water, please don't drink the milk.
[01:28:47.276 --> 01:28:47.716]  We're good to go.
[01:29:16.664 --> 01:29:17.224]  Alright, Doctor!
[01:29:45.883 --> 01:29:47.924]  Stay there.
[01:29:47.924 --> 01:29:48.944]  Long segment coming up.
[01:29:48.944 --> 01:29:51.565]  We'll be right back with you, sir, to continue along that line.
[01:29:51.565 --> 01:29:52.946]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.946 --> 01:29:55.467]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.467 --> 01:29:58.148]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:02.478 --> 01:30:06.500]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:30:06.500 --> 01:30:09.741]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:30:09.741 --> 01:30:14.543]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:30:14.543 --> 01:30:20.925]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:30:20.925 --> 01:30:23.166]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:30:23.706 --> 01:30:24.006]  Tim Geithner?
[01:30:24.006 --> 01:30:24.526]  Bernanke?
[01:30:24.526 --> 01:30:25.187]  They're arsonists!
[01:30:25.187 --> 01:30:26.467]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:30:26.467 --> 01:30:28.728]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:30:42.614 --> 01:30:49.876]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:30:49.876 --> 01:30:58.999]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:31:02.313 --> 01:31:09.338]  Alex has told you that the Mideast uprisings over food prices and shortages caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide.
[01:31:09.338 --> 01:31:11.999]  We're seeing the impact right here in the United States.
[01:31:11.999 --> 01:31:21.045]  Ethanol that was supposed to reduce petroleum use and fuel prices hit a 30-month high in February, and pump prices are expected to reach $5 a gallon.
[01:31:21.045 --> 01:31:29.310]  Because of shipping costs, food is being priced out of the reach of millions of Americans with an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days.
[01:31:29.310 --> 01:31:30.671]  Move quickly while you can still
[01:31:30.751 --> 01:31:31.111]  I think so.
[01:32:00.749 --> 01:32:01.910]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:32:01.910 --> 01:32:08.834]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:32:08.834 --> 01:32:11.396]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:32:11.396 --> 01:32:16.779]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:32:16.779 --> 01:32:19.821]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:32:19.821 --> 01:32:21.882]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:32:22.122 --> 01:32:28.367]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:32:28.367 --> 01:32:31.749]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:32:31.749 --> 01:32:37.553]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:32:37.553 --> 01:32:39.174]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:32:39.174 --> 01:32:40.475]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:32:40.475 --> 01:32:42.997]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:32:43.157 --> 01:32:47.359]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:32:47.359 --> 01:32:51.981]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:32:51.981 --> 01:32:54.582]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[01:32:54.582 --> 01:32:57.583]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:32:57.583 --> 01:32:58.203]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:33:05.049 --> 01:33:06.050]  Big Brother.
[01:33:06.050 --> 01:33:07.711]  Mainstream media.
[01:33:07.711 --> 01:33:09.093]  Government cover-ups.
[01:33:09.093 --> 01:33:10.394]  You want answers?
[01:33:10.394 --> 01:33:12.436]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:12.436 --> 01:33:21.404]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:21.404 --> 01:33:23.526]  Dr. Chris Busby is our guest.
[01:33:23.526 --> 01:33:28.150]  He is a chemical physicist, a chemist, and a physicist.
[01:33:29.734 --> 01:33:40.920]  And everything he's saying dovetails with the research we've done with countless other researchers, physicists, chemists, medical doctors, radiation specialists, with the depleted uranium.
[01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:44.341]  They used thousands and thousands of tons of it in each war.
[01:33:44.341 --> 01:33:48.404]  Now they use it at local shooting ranges and proving grounds all over the world.
[01:33:48.404 --> 01:33:49.724]  They use it in Hawaii.
[01:33:49.724 --> 01:33:51.565]  They use it in Texas.
[01:33:51.565 --> 01:33:53.386]  Hundreds and hundreds of sites total.
[01:33:53.386 --> 01:33:54.867]  Just 20 years ago, they wouldn't dare.
[01:33:56.243 --> 01:34:03.714]  They had the Pentagon's own manuals that it was a Cold War emergency weapon if the Russians poured into Europe once nuclear war was already on.
[01:34:03.714 --> 01:34:06.418]  It has a four plus billion year half-life.
[01:34:06.418 --> 01:34:09.904]  Now, they say, well, it doesn't put off a lot of radiation, though you shouldn't sit on the ammo can.
[01:34:11.018 --> 01:34:11.939]  But that's not the issue.
[01:34:11.939 --> 01:34:26.210]  It's that when you breathe it in, and it aerosolizes when it hits targets, and when you fire it, it's on fire when it goes out of the M16, the .308, the .50 cal, the Abrams gun, the artillery.
[01:34:26.210 --> 01:34:31.214]  When you breathe it, it goes in and gets in your lungs and your lymphatic system and causes cancer.
[01:34:31.214 --> 01:34:31.995]  And this is admitted.
[01:34:33.117 --> 01:34:37.441]  The British Medical Journal, 12 to 15 times deformities in Fallujah alone.
[01:34:37.441 --> 01:34:42.667]  Four-time increase in our troops of congenital birth defects, cancers caused directly by it.
[01:34:42.667 --> 01:34:49.193]  They know, but they use it, which shows a brazen, psychopathic attitude.
[01:34:49.193 --> 01:34:51.756]  Now, we're talking about stuff much worse than DU now.
[01:34:52.236 --> 01:34:53.456]  We're talking about tritium.
[01:34:53.456 --> 01:34:55.657]  We're talking about uranium, plutonium.
[01:34:55.657 --> 01:35:05.138]  We're talking about all the things that all this waste spewing into the air touches, now becoming radioactive in a chain reaction and blowing towards the West Coast.
[01:35:05.138 --> 01:35:13.300]  And doctor, they've gone from denying that it would reach the Aleutian Islands today and then the West Coast tomorrow.
[01:35:13.300 --> 01:35:18.701]  And when that first low-level radiation hits from just the leak on Friday, they're going to spin and say, no big deal.
[01:35:19.321 --> 01:35:33.976]  That's what they're going to say, because they're going to say that the radiation doses that you measure using Geiger counters are only some fractionally higher levels than natural background radiation.
[01:35:33.976 --> 01:35:35.698]  And that is the basis of the lie.
[01:35:35.698 --> 01:35:42.125]  And it is a lie that has resulted in the greatest public health scandal of human history, which
[01:35:42.125 --> 01:35:42.625]  We're good.
[01:36:05.875 --> 01:36:07.697]  In all of the countries that keep data.
[01:36:07.697 --> 01:36:12.680]  And the reason for that is exposure to all of these materials that we've been talking about.
[01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:20.065]  Mainly these particles, but other internal radionuclides like tritium and like strontium-90.
[01:36:20.065 --> 01:36:21.766]  Materials which bind to DNA.
[01:36:21.766 --> 01:36:22.567]  This is the point.
[01:36:22.567 --> 01:36:26.830]  Uranium binds to DNA, plutonium binds to DNA, strontium-90 binds to DNA.
[01:36:26.830 --> 01:36:31.333]  So they actually deliver their radioactivity, they deliver the electrons
[01:36:32.814 --> 01:36:33.655]  We're good to go.
[01:36:52.330 --> 01:36:53.230]  We're good to go.
[01:37:14.815 --> 01:37:26.118]  So they destroy, just like the GMO companies destroy the capacity of indigenous populations to grow their own natural food and then sell them Terminator seeds that they have to buy each year.
[01:37:26.118 --> 01:37:37.960]  Now, as the human genetic system's destroyed, then we have to go get artificial treatments to continue to reproduce, giving the scientific dictatorship control over reproduction and over the future of the species.
[01:37:37.960 --> 01:37:44.022]  I wanted to expand on something here with you, Doctor, along the lines of the radiation.
[01:37:44.762 --> 01:37:44.782]  I
[01:38:02.216 --> 01:38:14.422]  Dozens of high-powered hydrogen bombs were detonated in the upper atmosphere and in the Van Allen Radiation Belt, quote, just to see what it would do, just to show how crazy they were.
[01:38:14.422 --> 01:38:21.126]  And they thought that some of this might ignite the atmosphere and burn the entire Earth up, but they still did it.
[01:38:21.126 --> 01:38:23.007]  I mean, it seems like these are psychopaths.
[01:38:24.316 --> 01:38:35.690]  I agree with you, and in fact the science, for me the science is not as interesting as asking the question, why do people believe what they believe, and why in particular do these people believe what they believe?
[01:38:35.690 --> 01:38:37.072]  That is a very interesting question.
[01:38:44.394 --> 01:38:44.734]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:39:02.612 --> 01:39:03.032]  We're good to go.
[01:39:24.541 --> 01:39:33.891]  I got to know reasonably well because he was on this government committee where we were discussing the effects of internal radiation and I have to say that I think the chap is quite mad.
[01:39:33.891 --> 01:39:36.974]  He is completely detached from reality.
[01:39:36.974 --> 01:39:37.875]  He was a particle physicist.
[01:39:40.919 --> 01:39:41.119]  I think so.
[01:39:56.257 --> 01:40:06.091]  The people who are running the show tend to believe this a lot, and I think that has to be how it works, in some kind of personality filtration way.
[01:40:06.091 --> 01:40:11.098]  There's all different kinds of people, different kinds of personalities, and they do get filtered into different jobs, don't they?
[01:40:11.812 --> 01:40:22.646]  Sure, that's the social engineer mastercraft, is picking different types that they study and track, and then putting them into certain specific areas so they don't see the larger systems.
[01:40:22.646 --> 01:40:23.768]  I think that's certainly true.
[01:40:23.768 --> 01:40:28.514]  It's what I've seen in my travels amongst the realms of the exalted.
[01:40:30.458 --> 01:40:32.339]  Yes, sir.
[01:40:32.339 --> 01:40:35.500]  I mean, that is my message to the planet.
[01:40:35.500 --> 01:40:37.861]  This does go out into America.
[01:40:37.861 --> 01:40:42.742]  The most important message that I have to give you all is that all of this is the same thing.
[01:40:42.742 --> 01:40:58.648]  The meltdown at Fukushima and the responses to it are the same as the meltdown at the explosion in Chernobyl and the responses to that, and the various responses of the nuclear industry to the arguments based on science, on epidemiology, on many, many studies.
[01:40:59.088 --> 01:40:59.348]  I don't know.
[01:41:14.460 --> 01:41:14.981]  Well, Doctor...
[01:41:34.963 --> 01:41:35.363]  Yes, sir.
[01:41:35.363 --> 01:41:46.867]  Doctor, I want to shift gears into some other areas, but adding just a caveat to what you've said, I've interviewed countless medical doctors here, many of them who went through medical school in the 40s, 50s, and 60s.
[01:41:46.867 --> 01:41:51.048]  To find a child with cancer then was like finding a four-leaf clover.
[01:41:51.048 --> 01:41:56.230]  It was so rare that doctors would travel from thousands of miles to see them.
[01:41:56.690 --> 01:41:59.771]  Now there are children all over my neighborhood with cancer dying.
[01:41:59.771 --> 01:42:00.952]  They're all over the schools.
[01:42:00.952 --> 01:42:05.474]  You go out to the mall, you see them with their hair falling out from chemotherapy.
[01:42:05.474 --> 01:42:08.315]  You read them in the obituaries every day.
[01:42:08.315 --> 01:42:14.538]  We know cancers on average are up over 2,000 percent, even more statistically in children.
[01:42:14.538 --> 01:42:18.800]  And then you see the TSA with unmetered radiation systems.
[01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:21.601]  Scientists come out and say it's 20 to 50 times the radiation.
[01:42:22.761 --> 01:42:24.303]  They lie about it.
[01:42:24.303 --> 01:42:39.354]  Then we learned it's at least 10 times this week that they were covering it up and that it's frying the TSA workers who are standing around all day, but they think they can wave a magic wand of false, irrational exuberance and say, we're fine.
[01:42:39.354 --> 01:42:41.236]  You know, this is safe.
[01:42:41.236 --> 01:42:46.540]  And it just shows almost a mass false confidence.
[01:42:47.483 --> 01:42:48.604]  Yes, I agree with you.
[01:42:48.604 --> 01:42:49.384]  I agree with you.
[01:42:49.384 --> 01:42:51.906]  It's very hard to understand how it goes on.
[01:42:51.906 --> 01:42:52.486]  It really is.
[01:42:52.486 --> 01:43:00.512]  There's a sort of groupthink involved in which these people just talk to each other and assume that everybody else is stupid.
[01:43:00.512 --> 01:43:07.897]  My belief is, in fact, that ordinary people are actually quite clever, and they can usually figure out what's going on.
[01:43:07.897 --> 01:43:11.079]  And I see that that's happening in Japan, incidentally.
[01:43:11.079 --> 01:43:13.180]  Everybody's fleeing, if they can.
[01:43:13.180 --> 01:43:14.481]  Nobody's believing the government.
[01:43:18.885 --> 01:43:23.852]  Well, that was my next question, doctor.
[01:43:23.852 --> 01:43:25.153]  That was my next question.
[01:43:25.153 --> 01:43:31.081]  Now we've got reports the Japanese are getting angry, we have no homes, the radiation is higher than what you said.
[01:43:31.081 --> 01:43:33.525]  How is... Well, number one,
[01:43:33.985 --> 01:43:36.227]  We're now six days into this.
[01:43:36.227 --> 01:43:39.489]  The media is saying the point of no return may have been reached.
[01:43:39.489 --> 01:43:40.850]  They may fully meltdown.
[01:43:40.850 --> 01:43:43.992]  A lot of experts believe that meltdowns have already occurred.
[01:43:43.992 --> 01:43:53.459]  They're covering up the real levels in those two states, in and around Fukushima, and the six stricken reactors, four that have blown up or are on fire.
[01:43:53.459 --> 01:43:57.622]  A, how do you statistically see this generally unfolding?
[01:43:57.622 --> 01:43:59.343]  How long could the disaster go on?
[01:43:59.343 --> 01:44:00.124]  Weeks?
[01:44:00.124 --> 01:44:00.404]  Months?
[01:44:02.987 --> 01:44:07.272]  There are three possibilities, and two of them are very bad.
[01:44:07.272 --> 01:44:11.757]  And the one that I think is likely to happen is one of those.
[01:44:11.757 --> 01:44:17.463]  Now, there's about 1,500 to 1,700 tonnes of mixed uranium and plutonium fuel there.
[01:44:17.463 --> 01:44:22.969]  My feeling is that the radiation levels will get so high that those guys will either die or they will have to get out.
[01:44:23.510 --> 01:44:23.971]  I don't think so.
[01:44:40.469 --> 01:44:40.789]  I don't know.
[01:44:55.956 --> 01:45:00.479]  So a lot of stuff will come across the United States, but it won't be like huge amounts.
[01:45:00.479 --> 01:45:19.533]  But I tell you what, the main problem is that if the plutonium, which is much more critically able to produce neutrons and explode in what's called prompt fission, if that gets together in the bottom of a tank and explodes like in the Kyshtym accident, then it will be an absolute nightmare for the globe, never mind about Japan.
[01:45:19.533 --> 01:45:24.077]  That stuff will go up into the atmosphere and it will get into the sea and it will float everywhere, and it's a really
[01:45:24.737 --> 01:45:26.539]  Serious, serious accident.
[01:45:26.539 --> 01:45:27.980]  I mean, much worse than Chernobyl.
[01:45:27.980 --> 01:45:32.043]  The amount of uranium that came out of Chernobyl in the explosion was 50 tons.
[01:45:32.043 --> 01:45:38.469]  We've got 1,700 tons, I'm told, in the spent fuel, and about 600 tons in the reactors themselves.
[01:45:38.469 --> 01:45:48.237]  And if they can't keep that stuff in, and it does go up in a nuclear explosion, it will be spread all over the planet, and that will be unimaginable, the consequences of that, unimaginable.
[01:45:48.857 --> 01:45:50.400]  So those are the two things.
[01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:55.687]  First of all, let's hope that it melts through the bottom of everything and goes into the ground and disappears downwards.
[01:45:55.687 --> 01:46:03.098]  At least that will produce an area that they can contain so they can throw a fence around it and they can call the North Island of Japan mankind's folly.
[01:46:04.214 --> 01:46:09.216]  Uh, and the sea will become contaminated and the fish will be contaminated and people can't eat them and all the rest of it.
[01:46:09.216 --> 01:46:15.037]  The second one is the explosion, which we just keep our fingers crossed and hope to God doesn't happen.
[01:46:15.037 --> 01:46:22.080]  Um, and the third one is they could just keep pouring water on it forever and, uh, radionuclides will slowly leak out all over the place.
[01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:24.580]  But I don't think that's going to be possible myself.
[01:46:24.580 --> 01:46:25.741]  But I mean, I may be wrong.
[01:46:25.741 --> 01:46:28.722]  The trouble is, you know, we're in science fiction territory here.
[01:46:28.722 --> 01:46:32.223]  Nobody has ever actually been able to do... Nobody's ever done this before.
[01:46:32.223 --> 01:46:33.183]  This hasn't happened before.
[01:46:39.136 --> 01:46:45.318]  Well, Doctor, continuing along this line, you know, fully understanding where this is going, I don't think
[01:47:07.694 --> 01:47:10.778]  That this is something the nuclear industry is going to be able to spin.
[01:47:10.778 --> 01:47:20.231]  This is a bridge too far and the fact that they've been trying to cover it up I think is going to be the death knell to their credibility because we didn't have the internet during Chernobyl or during Three Mile Island.
[01:47:20.231 --> 01:47:20.852]  A comment on that?
[01:47:21.536 --> 01:47:24.297]  Yeah, and we didn't have Geiger counters either.
[01:47:24.297 --> 01:47:29.698]  After Chernobyl, so many Geiger counters were being sold on eBay that an awful lot of them are out there now.
[01:47:29.698 --> 01:47:34.478]  I mean, when Chernobyl was happening, I was here in Wales, and we got the radiation from Chernobyl came here.
[01:47:34.478 --> 01:47:37.119]  I couldn't afford a Geiger counter, and nobody else had one.
[01:47:37.119 --> 01:47:48.201]  But now everybody's got one, and I've got a laboratory here with several, and the Internet is there, and they're giving minute-by-minute readings from all sorts of sites all over the United States and Japan and everywhere else.
[01:47:48.821 --> 01:47:52.862]  So yeah, they can't spin it on that level, but I tell you how they will spin it.
[01:47:52.862 --> 01:47:57.543]  What they'll do is they'll say that the doses are very much too low, just like I said before.
[01:47:57.543 --> 01:48:03.025]  So the number of millisieverts involved when it gets to America will be very low.
[01:48:03.025 --> 01:48:07.466]  And then when you do get an increase in cancer five years later, there'll be a big increase in cancer.
[01:48:07.466 --> 01:48:13.288]  They'll say, oh, well, it's because of an aging population, or they'll find some reason
[01:48:14.088 --> 01:48:16.889]  They will certainly have a go at it, you can be assured of that.
[01:48:16.889 --> 01:48:17.950]  I mean, look, I have children.
[01:48:17.950 --> 01:48:18.410]  Three of them.
[01:48:40.846 --> 01:48:43.790]  And I am in the realm of reality.
[01:48:43.790 --> 01:48:49.837]  That's why I told people Friday it was worse than they were saying, Saturday, Monday, the fuel rods hiding in plain view.
[01:48:49.837 --> 01:48:59.729]  It's in mainstream news that 600,000 fuel rods are there, that hundreds of thousands were stored on top of plants that blew sky-high, and then they're not releasing the radiation information.
[01:49:00.470 --> 01:49:06.712]  The media made fun of people saying that radiation would come here Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
[01:49:06.712 --> 01:49:14.575]  Now they admit it's coming here, but the usual canned response of, oh, it's no big deal, you know, it's three or four times what you get from the sun.
[01:49:14.575 --> 01:49:20.117]  No, it's going into your body, ladies and gentlemen, and it's affecting your lifetime dose.
[01:49:20.117 --> 01:49:24.599]  We already get cancer because of the natural amount of radiation out there.
[01:49:24.599 --> 01:49:26.340]  And I've seen the studies of mummies.
[01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:29.461]  In China, not just in Egypt.
[01:49:29.461 --> 01:49:31.341]  And cancer is unknown.
[01:49:31.341 --> 01:49:33.022]  These are real numbers.
[01:49:33.022 --> 01:49:36.083]  Cancer was almost unknown 150 years ago.
[01:49:36.083 --> 01:49:44.005]  And in the last 50 years... Listen, I've got friends that work in the office whose girlfriends have died of cancer or are dying.
[01:49:44.005 --> 01:49:46.006]  Kids dying at school.
[01:49:46.006 --> 01:49:47.927]  I mean, it's an epidemic.
[01:49:47.927 --> 01:49:50.888]  And elitist children are dying.
[01:49:50.888 --> 01:49:51.568]  And clearly,
[01:49:52.128 --> 01:50:05.792]  A big part of this is the dioxins and the mercury in the vaccines, but the big driver from the studies I've seen is the radiation, the runoff from the plants, the runoff from the weapons plants, and they're killing us.
[01:50:05.792 --> 01:50:10.634]  And look at America, the biggest nuke site in the world after Russia, highest cancer rates.
[01:50:10.634 --> 01:50:13.434]  Then they lie and say, well, we're living longer.
[01:50:13.434 --> 01:50:15.255]  Actually, the U.S.
[01:50:15.255 --> 01:50:18.596]  population numbers have gone down, and they don't tell you that
[01:50:19.116 --> 01:50:23.638]  Fetal birth rates, babies dying, that number's gone down.
[01:50:23.638 --> 01:50:27.600]  On average, about 30% of children 100 years ago would die from complications.
[01:50:27.600 --> 01:50:34.043]  But if you made it past five, if you look at the numbers and average those out, the average person lived past 85.
[01:50:34.043 --> 01:50:36.585]  Now with men, it's about 73.
[01:50:36.585 --> 01:50:38.366]  Women, it's 76.
[01:50:38.366 --> 01:50:42.248]  And then they have all these advanced technologies to keep you alive for 20 years.
[01:50:42.248 --> 01:50:45.849]  When you start getting sick, sick at 55, but it's unnatural.
[01:50:45.849 --> 01:50:46.670]  We'll talk about that.
[01:50:47.090 --> 01:50:47.770]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:50:47.770 --> 01:50:52.454]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:50:52.454 --> 01:50:53.915]  Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[01:51:10.347 --> 01:51:13.529]  Non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold.
[01:51:13.529 --> 01:51:14.009]  It's true.
[01:51:14.009 --> 01:51:16.811]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[01:51:16.811 --> 01:51:19.092]  And it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:51:19.092 --> 01:51:24.315]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:24.315 --> 01:51:26.637]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:51:26.637 --> 01:51:31.439]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:31.439 --> 01:51:32.560]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:32.560 --> 01:51:35.622]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:51:35.622 --> 01:51:38.924]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:39.244 --> 01:51:42.427]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:42.427 --> 01:51:44.648]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:44.648 --> 01:51:45.589]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:51:45.589 --> 01:51:45.989]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:45.989 --> 01:51:49.232]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:49.232 --> 01:51:50.953]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:01.101 --> 01:52:07.949]  Dr. David Barry has provided excellent advice for all those interested in practical economics and sound money.
[01:52:07.949 --> 01:52:09.551]  It's certainly worth reading.
[01:52:09.551 --> 01:52:17.380]  That's what Congressman Ron Paul said about Chachine Wisdom, 123 Practical Universal Truths About Money, the new book by Dr. David Barry.
[01:52:17.620 --> 01:52:26.625]  The cool part of this book, certainly it'll speak to you personally, your life, your lifestyle, your money, your investments, but it also can be generalized into the nation, what's going on as a nation.
[01:52:26.625 --> 01:52:29.407]  We do these same things personally that we do as a nation.
[01:52:29.407 --> 01:52:39.032]  Dr. Barry's book, Cha-Ching Wisdom, presents many facets of your relationship with the once almighty dollar and how current national and international politics affect your daily life.
[01:52:39.232 --> 01:52:40.914]  Some of the other things are about that.
[01:52:40.914 --> 01:52:43.556]  They're not just economic, they're philosophical.
[01:52:43.556 --> 01:52:45.258]  There's psychology involved in this book.
[01:52:45.258 --> 01:52:46.900]  There's philosophy involved in this book.
[01:52:46.900 --> 01:52:49.582]  Read Cha-Ching Wisdom by Dr. David Barry, only $9.95.
[01:52:49.582 --> 01:52:53.006]  Available at cha-chingwisdom.com.
[01:52:53.006 --> 01:52:57.350]  That's C-H-A-C-H-I-N-G-wisdom.com.

[01:53:00.984 --> 01:53:04.405]  The largest part of gaining radiant health is detoxification.
[01:53:04.405 --> 01:53:12.248]  You can drink ionized water, cleanse your intestines, eat a perfect diet, and even take lots of quality supplements and in many instances only make minimal progress.
[01:53:12.248 --> 01:53:16.809]  What is the key to detoxifying your body of mercury, heavy metals, chemicals, and drugs?
[01:53:16.809 --> 01:53:18.249]  It is glutathione.
[01:53:18.249 --> 01:53:22.311]  Glutathione is the master antioxidant used to detoxify your entire body.
[01:53:22.311 --> 01:53:25.672]  It stops free radicals, keeps cells young, and reduces inflammation.
[01:53:26.312 --> 01:53:32.097]  One World Whey Protein Powder may be able to raise your glutathione production by 64% or more.
[01:53:32.097 --> 01:53:39.344]  One World Whey is more effective than any other whey protein powder on the market because it is unheated and from grass-fed cows.
[01:53:39.344 --> 01:53:44.168]  All other, quote, cold-processed whey protein powders have been heated and damaged by 15% or more.
[01:53:45.769 --> 01:53:48.171]  One World Way comes in three delicious flavors.
[01:53:48.171 --> 01:53:50.494]  Call 888-988-3325.
[01:53:50.494 --> 01:53:53.556]  That's 888-988-3325.

[01:54:05.628 --> 01:54:11.113]  If a 300-mile area in Russia is still uninhabitable because of a fuel rod explosion,
[01:54:13.220 --> 01:54:19.304]  What do you think's gonna happen if there are huge, and we don't know, it could've already happened with the cover-up that's going on.
[01:54:19.304 --> 01:54:22.946]  What's gonna happen to Tokyo, 150 miles away from Fukushima?
[01:54:22.946 --> 01:54:25.668]  Now, most of it's going out to sea.
[01:54:25.668 --> 01:54:33.533]  But as the wind changes and blows over that disaster site, it is almost incalculable what is going to happen.
[01:54:33.533 --> 01:54:38.197]  Dr. Christopher Busby is our guest for just a few more minutes.
[01:54:38.197 --> 01:54:39.878]  He is a chemical physicist.
[01:54:41.139 --> 01:54:44.942]  Sir in the time we have what can we do?
[01:54:44.942 --> 01:54:46.664]  Obviously put pressure on the government.
[01:54:46.664 --> 01:54:49.586]  We know the Pentagon's out there getting readings They're not telling us.
[01:54:49.586 --> 01:54:54.850]  They just moved the ships back 200 miles There's clearly a cover-up going on here.
[01:54:54.850 --> 01:54:55.671]  What can we do?
[01:54:55.671 --> 01:54:57.912]  To try to deal with this.
[01:54:57.912 --> 01:54:59.654]  I mean, I mean, here's an example here in Austin
[01:55:00.728 --> 01:55:04.190]  They have an experimental reactor and a second reactor at the J.J.
[01:55:04.190 --> 01:55:05.150]  Pickle Center.
[01:55:05.150 --> 01:55:10.613]  It's been there for decades, and I tell the average Austinite about it, and then I'm concerned about it, and they laugh at me.
[01:55:10.613 --> 01:55:18.978]  There's almost like an inbred, gibbering, giggling, pre-programmed psychological compulsion program to giggle.
[01:55:19.639 --> 01:55:20.359]  Yes, that's right.
[01:55:20.359 --> 01:55:21.440]  You're right about that.
[01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:22.400]  I've noticed that as well.
[01:55:22.400 --> 01:55:22.961]  They giggle.
[01:55:22.961 --> 01:55:23.521]  That's true.
[01:55:23.521 --> 01:55:26.903]  This guy I was telling you about, he always giggles.
[01:55:26.903 --> 01:55:35.607]  Giggling, incidentally, is kind of like a denial thing, you know, because their mind sort of switches off and all the clocks start meshing in such a way that they giggle.
[01:55:35.607 --> 01:55:37.008]  Very interesting response there.
[01:55:37.008 --> 01:55:37.548]  I agree.
[01:55:37.548 --> 01:55:39.129]  Listen, here's what you can do.
[01:55:39.129 --> 01:55:44.552]  The point is that you have to destroy the current belief in the government in their risk model.
[01:55:45.012 --> 01:55:50.277]  There is an alternative risk model out there, which my colleagues and I started working on in 1997.
[01:55:50.277 --> 01:55:58.303]  And you can find all this stuff on the website of the European Committee on Radiation Risk, which is Euradcom.org.
[01:55:58.303 --> 01:56:06.130]  And most of the stuff I do now is actually on the website of the Low-Level Radiation Campaign, so that's LLRC.org.
[01:56:06.130 --> 01:56:07.551]  You'll find a lot of my stuff on Green
[01:56:17.028 --> 01:56:19.009]  Let me throw this at you real fast.
[01:56:19.009 --> 01:56:32.940]  They now, literally hundreds of studies admitting that cell phones are causing brain tumors and that it's microwave radiation, that it vibrates the DNA in the brain tissue and changes it.
[01:56:32.940 --> 01:56:34.381]  I mean, that's another example.
[01:56:35.037 --> 01:56:39.759]  Well, that's right, but the way in which that works is by modulating ionizing radiation.
[01:56:39.759 --> 01:56:43.081]  We're getting together a very big study to show this.
[01:56:43.081 --> 01:57:04.052]  What happens is that just like you wiggle the electrons in a TV cathode ray tube, the electrons that are produced from the ionizing radiation, from the plutonium, from all that stuff, they get wiggled by the cell phone radiation, and you always have some of those in your body from natural background radiation, you know, from the normal natural background stuff in your body, potassium-40 and so on.
[01:57:05.172 --> 01:57:18.218]  If you phone on a cell phone, what happens is the microwave electromagnetic radiation that goes into your tissue and causes those electrons to wiggle more and that produces more energy and increases your ionizing radiation dose.
[01:57:18.218 --> 01:57:22.519]  We believe that is the origin of these increases, which are very real, incidentally.
[01:57:22.519 --> 01:57:25.901]  Well, they've now admitted that brain activity increases when you're on a cell phone.
[01:57:26.201 --> 01:57:28.461]  Yes, well that's because it gets heated up.
[01:57:28.461 --> 01:57:37.783]  That's just because what happens is that as you wiggle the electrons, you heat up the material, just like you heat up in a microwave cooker, you heat up your food.
[01:57:37.783 --> 01:57:39.243]  It's the same thing.
[01:57:39.243 --> 01:57:48.425]  Unbelievable that this is going on, but I don't think that the nuclear power industry is going to really be able to survive this.
[01:57:48.425 --> 01:57:49.285]  I hope so.
[01:57:49.285 --> 01:57:52.646]  I sincerely hope so, but I didn't think it was able to survive Chernobyl, and it did.
[01:57:54.778 --> 01:58:00.445]  And I've seen a lot of the modern greenies, briefly, now coming out saying nuke is the answer.
[01:58:00.445 --> 01:58:02.928]  They want neighborhood nukes, they say are safe.
[01:58:05.303 --> 01:58:06.925]  No nukes are safe, Erlich.
[01:58:06.925 --> 01:58:07.505]  No nukes.
[01:58:07.505 --> 01:58:23.837]  I mean, just operating normally, they produce loads of radioactivity, and we see childhood leukemia near all the nuclear plants in Germany, and incidentally also all the nuclear plants that I've studied, several of those, you get increases in childhood leukemia, and those are like a miner's canary.
[01:58:23.837 --> 01:58:28.341]  So if the childhood leukemia is going up, it means the DNA is being damaged, and that's in the parents as well.
[01:58:28.341 --> 01:58:30.482]  So we do find increases in breast cancer.
[01:58:31.643 --> 01:58:32.204]  Absolutely.
[01:58:32.204 --> 01:58:34.345]  Dr. Busby, out of time.
[01:58:34.345 --> 01:58:35.245]  Thank you so much.
[01:58:35.245 --> 01:58:37.066]  I look forward to speaking to you in the near future.
[01:58:37.066 --> 01:58:43.010]  Thank you for your information.
[01:58:43.010 --> 01:58:46.632]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:51.431 --> 01:58:55.635]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:58:55.635 --> 01:59:02.040]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:59:02.040 --> 01:59:09.427]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:59:09.427 --> 01:59:14.311]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[01:59:19.255 --> 01:59:23.000]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.302]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[01:59:50.205 --> 01:59:54.328]  Thank you.
[01:59:54.328 --> 01:59:56.709]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.709 --> 01:59:59.471]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:06.192 --> 02:00:11.016]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:11.016 --> 02:00:12.597]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.597 --> 02:00:14.158]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.158 --> 02:00:18.341]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.341 --> 02:00:24.987]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.987 --> 02:00:28.249]  We are live into the third hour today.
[02:00:28.249 --> 02:00:31.812]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:00:31.812 --> 02:00:34.194]  I want to open the phones up specifically
[02:00:35.979 --> 02:00:56.946]  If you are in the Aleutian Islands where they're reporting that the radiation should be arriving right about now or if you are in Japan trying to flee south or have any reports or if you have family or in the military or you're in the military that have given you reports about preparations on the west coast the EPA says they are preparing with more radiation monitors I guess so they can get out
[02:00:57.446 --> 02:01:03.172]  In front of the story and tell people that increases in radiation set to hit the West Coast tomorrow are no big deal.
[02:01:03.172 --> 02:01:04.293]  I want to open the phones up.
[02:01:04.293 --> 02:01:06.035]  1-800-259-9231 800-259-9231 We're all in the same boat as our troops.
[02:01:06.035 --> 02:01:06.956]  Desert Storm 1 and 2.
[02:01:17.858 --> 02:01:18.098]  I don't
[02:01:37.824 --> 02:01:45.568]  Twelve to fifteen times, depending on which British or US study it is, increase in cancers in areas of Fallujah where they used heavy DU.
[02:01:45.568 --> 02:01:47.949]  Four times increase in our own troops.
[02:01:47.949 --> 02:01:52.071]  This is the psychopathic nature of the New World Order.
[02:01:52.071 --> 02:01:56.633]  And you heard the doctor saying that, you know, many believe they're doing this on purpose.
[02:01:57.827 --> 02:02:02.008]  But that they'll never admit that to him, and he travels in the top circles in Europe.
[02:02:02.008 --> 02:02:04.509]  He's on the top boards, in the government boards.
[02:02:04.509 --> 02:02:10.211]  They just laugh and giggle and snicker and enjoy themselves.
[02:02:10.211 --> 02:02:15.512]  Well, I happen to have the White House Scienczar's own documents talking about sterilizing us.
[02:02:15.512 --> 02:02:24.675]  I happen to know that they are mining sodium fluoride out of rock formations that have uranium and other isotopes, radium,
[02:02:25.575 --> 02:02:45.780]  You name it and that that's being put in our water and I told you that years ago and Dr. Conrad on talking about it years ago and now it's mainstream news that oh we don't know there was a cover-up of radiation in the water all over Texas and other states oh the government didn't want you to know folks they aren't just putting the fluoride in they're putting uranium and other isotopes in your water
[02:02:48.243 --> 02:02:52.046]  And in a way, this meltdown and these explosions is a wake-up call.
[02:02:52.046 --> 02:02:53.707]  We're already under this attack.
[02:02:53.707 --> 02:02:54.988]  It's already going on.
[02:02:54.988 --> 02:02:56.849]  They're building more reactors everywhere.
[02:02:56.849 --> 02:03:03.074]  In Canada, they announced yesterday they had released a bunch of radiation into the lake that it's based on and that it cools from.
[02:03:03.074 --> 02:03:05.376]  And said, oh, don't worry, it's not much above normal background.
[02:03:06.016 --> 02:03:09.719]  Yeah, if you put a Geiger counter over it, oh, that's only double or triple normal.
[02:03:09.719 --> 02:03:12.501]  Yeah, but if you drink it, it sits there.
[02:03:12.501 --> 02:03:13.681]  It gets in your bones.
[02:03:13.681 --> 02:03:15.403]  It gets in your liver.
[02:03:15.403 --> 02:03:17.144]  It gets in your thyroid.
[02:03:17.144 --> 02:03:19.225]  It gets in your limbic system.
[02:03:19.225 --> 02:03:20.466]  It gets in your lungs.
[02:03:21.838 --> 02:03:28.944]  And you cannot deny sperm counts in every industrialized nation are plunging, plunging, plunging, plunging, plunging.
[02:03:28.944 --> 02:03:29.484]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:03:29.484 --> 02:03:29.604]  800-259-9231.
[02:03:29.604 --> 02:03:30.785]  We will get you up and on the air.
[02:03:30.785 --> 02:03:33.107]  We will get you up on the air to discuss these issues.
[02:03:33.107 --> 02:03:35.069]  I want to hear what you have to say if you're in Japan.
[02:03:50.698 --> 02:03:50.958]  I think?
[02:04:02.458 --> 02:04:08.660]  Radiation detectors that are part of organizations that hook into the web to track these, and they're already showing increases on the West Coast.
[02:04:08.660 --> 02:04:11.620]  Moderate, you know, doubling, quote, from safe background level.
[02:04:11.620 --> 02:04:12.841]  I don't know if that's accurate.
[02:04:12.841 --> 02:04:16.542]  We're trying to track it all at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:04:16.542 --> 02:04:19.042]  We're trying to do the best job we can.
[02:04:19.042 --> 02:04:25.084]  But your phone calls specifically on those issues coming up on the other side of this quick break.
[02:04:25.084 --> 02:04:25.144]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:04:30.565 --> 02:04:34.707]  And obviously we'll probably have to go into overdrive again today as all of this unfolds.
[02:04:34.707 --> 02:04:46.171]  This is such a serious time to be alive and to see the fallout from this, the media cover up, the Pentagon on site, all over the place in Japan, in the Pacific.
[02:04:46.171 --> 02:04:47.311]  They know what's going on.
[02:04:47.311 --> 02:04:48.532]  They know what's being released.
[02:04:48.532 --> 02:04:50.212]  The Japanese won't release it.
[02:04:50.212 --> 02:04:52.133]  USA Today confirmed what we told you yesterday.
[02:04:52.133 --> 02:04:55.454]  Today, the Japanese are covering up the radiation meters.
[02:04:55.454 --> 02:04:57.635]  I mean, this is we don't know what's happened.
[02:04:57.635 --> 02:04:59.856]  We know it's bad with all those explosions and fires.
[02:05:02.386 --> 02:05:17.863]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[02:05:17.863 --> 02:05:21.527]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:22.543 --> 02:05:35.315]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:05:35.315 --> 02:05:42.582]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[02:05:43.263 --> 02:05:53.636]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[02:05:53.636 --> 02:05:57.561]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[02:05:57.561 --> 02:06:00.685]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[02:06:01.266 --> 02:06:05.827]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:06:05.827 --> 02:06:06.727]  Number 1.
[02:06:06.727 --> 02:06:10.148]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:06:10.148 --> 02:06:11.008]  Number 2.
[02:06:11.008 --> 02:06:15.910]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:06:15.910 --> 02:06:16.650]  It's true.
[02:06:16.650 --> 02:06:21.511]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:06:21.511 --> 02:06:22.351]  Number 3.
[02:06:22.351 --> 02:06:25.932]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:06:25.932 --> 02:06:29.633]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:06:29.833 --> 02:06:30.634]  Number 4.
[02:06:30.634 --> 02:06:33.396]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:06:33.396 --> 02:06:37.078]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:06:37.078 --> 02:06:37.859]  Number 5.
[02:06:37.859 --> 02:06:42.022]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:06:42.022 --> 02:06:46.785]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:06:47.065 --> 02:06:51.229]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:06:51.229 --> 02:06:53.031]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:06:53.031 --> 02:06:55.273]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:06:55.273 --> 02:06:57.616]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:07:01.092 --> 02:07:04.933]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[02:07:04.933 --> 02:07:09.194]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[02:07:09.194 --> 02:07:14.314]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[02:07:14.314 --> 02:07:19.835]  Not looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[02:07:19.835 --> 02:07:26.917]  Not worried about them moving south, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[02:07:29.631 --> 02:07:35.178]  I'm looking for America.
[02:07:35.178 --> 02:07:36.800]  Wear American and be proud.
[02:07:36.800 --> 02:07:39.524]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[02:07:55.586 --> 02:08:00.232]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[02:08:00.232 --> 02:08:06.940]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:06.940 --> 02:08:09.223]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:10.836 --> 02:08:12.838]  Well, I want to commend our audience.
[02:08:12.838 --> 02:08:25.828]  I gave the number out five minutes ago for only people in Japan, or folks that have military information on what the military is preparing to do, or folks in the Aleutian Islands.
[02:08:25.828 --> 02:08:30.252]  USA Today, New York Times, all reporting confirming what we said yesterday.
[02:08:30.252 --> 02:08:31.893]  The Japanese are not releasing
[02:08:33.174 --> 02:08:35.216]  Geiger countered data.
[02:08:35.216 --> 02:08:37.458]  We know it was double, triple, or quadruple before.
[02:08:37.458 --> 02:08:40.841]  They don't want to show 10, 20, 30 times if it's melted down.
[02:08:40.841 --> 02:08:42.162]  What's really happening there?
[02:08:42.162 --> 02:08:43.443]  That's confirmed.
[02:08:43.443 --> 02:08:57.055]  It's also confirmed that they're estimating NOAA, the National Weather Service, is predicting that the first radiation that's lower from just the smaller problems last Friday will be reaching Southern California tomorrow.
[02:08:58.056 --> 02:09:03.399]  Uh, via the wind streams and not just the jet stream, but the trade winds below it and the surface winds.
[02:09:03.399 --> 02:09:04.859]  Hopefully most of it will go in the ocean.
[02:09:04.859 --> 02:09:08.521]  We're going to be here tracking all this live, but I, I commend the listeners.
[02:09:08.521 --> 02:09:12.663]  I said, only if you have Intel or you're in Japan call in and we only got one caller.
[02:09:13.924 --> 02:09:21.649]  So again, open phones for those who've got radiation detectors on the West Coast who are planning to track this.
[02:09:21.649 --> 02:09:23.170]  Have you gotten higher levels?
[02:09:23.170 --> 02:09:24.031]  Are you in Japan?
[02:09:24.031 --> 02:09:25.932]  Do you have family in Japan?
[02:09:25.932 --> 02:09:25.992]  800-259-9231.
[02:09:25.992 --> 02:09:26.032]  800-259-9231.
[02:09:33.078 --> 02:09:39.366]  9231 will get you up and on the air right now and Ron in California hung up.
[02:09:39.366 --> 02:09:40.587]  Ron, you were fine.
[02:09:40.587 --> 02:09:43.631]  You had a military source in your family that you were going to
[02:09:45.327 --> 02:09:45.907]  I don't think so.
[02:10:12.802 --> 02:10:18.326]  Folks there in Australia saying your media is basically though trying to spin it like it's no big deal.
[02:10:18.326 --> 02:10:21.788]  Some of the media is being more honest about it.
[02:10:21.788 --> 02:10:23.909]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:10:23.909 --> 02:10:27.831]  I'll widen the field for folks to call in.
[02:10:27.831 --> 02:10:38.518]  If you're a nuclear physicist or work in plants or have comments about the explosions and fires that we've seen and now the Japanese saying they may have to abandon hope that they may not be able to
[02:10:39.258 --> 02:10:40.378]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[02:10:40.378 --> 02:10:44.059]  Hey, I was just searching the local news and I saw Hawaii USPS checks
[02:11:07.782 --> 02:11:10.886]  Japan Mail for Radiation.
[02:11:10.886 --> 02:11:13.429]  The first paragraph says, uh, U.S.
[02:11:13.429 --> 02:11:24.762]  Postal Service in Hawaii has begun checking mail arriving from Japan after mail in San Francisco and New York showed low levels of radiation, UPS official said.
[02:11:24.762 --> 02:11:27.786]  So I just wanted to call you guys and turn you on to this story.
[02:11:29.062 --> 02:11:29.882]  Yes, sir.
[02:11:29.882 --> 02:11:49.010]  Bloomberg did report two hours ago that flights from Tokyo into Dallas and into Chicago, O'Hare and DFW, both had radiation in the planes and on the people and their baggage, and they just released them.
[02:11:49.010 --> 02:11:52.131]  And I mean, that's the time to confiscate their bags and say, sorry,
[02:11:52.731 --> 02:11:54.932]  This is going to a nuclear waste dump.
[02:11:54.932 --> 02:11:59.715]  Sorry, we're not going to let you take it home to your family and your kids and your neighbors or in the taxi cab.
[02:11:59.715 --> 02:12:01.916]  The planes are getting contaminated.
[02:12:01.916 --> 02:12:04.837]  They're also reporting NBC reporters have been contaminated.
[02:12:04.837 --> 02:12:07.799]  And the answer is, don't put them in scrubbers.
[02:12:07.799 --> 02:12:10.960]  Don't put them in decontamination facilities for their own health.
[02:12:10.960 --> 02:12:15.683]  Put them in where they scrub down with soap and water and get it all off of them and then they blast that out.
[02:12:15.683 --> 02:12:17.684]  No, just send it on into America.
[02:12:18.024 --> 02:12:20.805]  Bring it on in, because radiation isn't bad.
[02:12:20.805 --> 02:12:29.047]  See, if they start acting like that radiation could be dangerous, then they have to admit there's a danger, see?
[02:12:29.047 --> 02:12:32.529]  Yes, it's very scary, Alex.
[02:12:32.529 --> 02:12:33.749]  Now, we do have those reports.
[02:12:33.749 --> 02:12:36.290]  Anything else, Chris?
[02:12:36.290 --> 02:12:44.332]  No, I'm just, uh, I'm on the Big Island of Hawaii, and just watching that jet stream, and it's pretty worrisome.
[02:12:44.332 --> 02:12:45.813]  They're not telling us anything here.
[02:12:47.310 --> 02:12:47.570]  I think so.
[02:12:59.116 --> 02:13:21.546]  Well, you heard what the chemical physicist was explaining and what Dr. Bob Bowman explained, three degrees in physics, and what countless other experts have said, like Dr. Doug Rocky, also a physicist, former head of the Pentagon's program on it, that even a doubling is super dangerous because if you breathe it in, but the media is spinning it like it's no big deal.
[02:13:21.546 --> 02:13:24.707]  Anything, and people in Hawaii, man, it's
[02:13:26.515 --> 02:13:28.596]  Nobody's awake here.
[02:13:28.596 --> 02:13:32.717]  I was talking up weeks before this and then this hit and I'm glad.
[02:13:32.717 --> 02:13:40.820]  I just want to thank you for waking me up because, you know, here's my food and water and I'm ready to go get plastic from my windows.
[02:13:40.820 --> 02:13:41.460]  I don't know.
[02:13:41.460 --> 02:13:50.123]  You know, the jet stream looks like this weekend it's going to kind of spin around Hawaii from what I see, but who knows, you know?
[02:13:50.123 --> 02:13:53.964]  We don't have the info and I just want to thank you for keeping us informed, man.
[02:13:56.001 --> 02:14:03.443]  Well, sir, I appreciate your call and I'm not trying to gripe at you, but everybody who calls in needs to kill their radio or it becomes a distraction.
[02:14:03.443 --> 02:14:04.763]  Again, headlines here.
[02:14:04.763 --> 02:14:07.544]  Radiation found at DFW O'Hare.
[02:14:07.544 --> 02:14:10.165]  This is all up on Infowars.com.
[02:14:10.165 --> 02:14:14.306]  Brought over by airline passengers, detectors installed at LAX.
[02:14:14.306 --> 02:14:16.846]  Radiation spurs fears around food.
[02:14:16.846 --> 02:14:18.747]  Despair turning to anger in Japan.
[02:14:18.747 --> 02:14:22.808]  That's also all up on the Drudge Report.
[02:14:23.508 --> 02:14:30.272]  And also they're reporting that some of the mail coming into the West Coast has tested positive for radiation.
[02:14:30.272 --> 02:14:33.893]  Continuing, no home, no help, no hope.
[02:14:33.893 --> 02:14:40.737]  Now Japan's despair turns to anger, tempers fray as homeless wait for food and medicine.
[02:14:42.084 --> 02:14:48.688]  As folks are saying, they're now six days into this with no evidence of being given any type of help.
[02:14:48.688 --> 02:15:09.079]  Again, I've specifically asked for callers on the issues that we've been covering, but no one has called in with specific intel, so I'll open the phones up completely with any comments, questions, or points you have, or if you want to point out any other news that we've not been covering with the economy, the stock market, the Middle East, the police state while we've been focused.
[02:15:10.160 --> 02:15:15.363]  On the radiation clouds ongoing, boiling out of Fukushima, coming our way.
[02:15:15.363 --> 02:15:15.783]  800-259-9231.
[02:15:15.783 --> 02:15:21.846]  Dr. Bob Bowman hasn't joined us in a couple of days.
[02:15:21.846 --> 02:15:28.130]  He'll be joining us coming up at the bottom of the hour to give us his expert analysis on the deteriorating situation.
[02:15:28.130 --> 02:15:37.595]  KITV Television reporting, Hawaii, USPS, Chex Japan, Mail for Radiation, San Francisco, New York centers find low levels
[02:15:38.370 --> 02:15:43.295]  Of course they said for two weeks that Chernobyl was low level.
[02:15:43.295 --> 02:15:45.937]  And they said for a lot longer than that, that
[02:15:48.920 --> 02:15:52.763]  There was no big deal from Three Mile Island and we now know that that was a lie.
[02:15:52.763 --> 02:15:53.123]  The U.S.
[02:15:53.123 --> 02:16:01.009]  Postal Service in Hawaii has begun checking mail arriving from Japan after mail in San Francisco and New York showed low levels of radiation, USPS officials said.
[02:16:01.009 --> 02:16:07.874]  Hawaii USPS spokesman Duke Gonzalez said there has been no mail in Honolulu found with radiation yet.
[02:16:07.874 --> 02:16:13.218]  The Customs and Border Patrol in Honolulu is helping to ensure that the mail is screened properly, he said.
[02:16:13.218 --> 02:16:17.481]  But in Dallas and in Chicago, they just go ahead and send it on through.
[02:16:18.669 --> 02:16:29.955]  Now, I've looked at the jet stream, and there's different bands of it, but the main jet stream going over Japan loops up in one piece by Alaska down.
[02:16:29.955 --> 02:16:32.537]  Another part of it goes over by California.
[02:16:32.537 --> 02:16:37.640]  And looking at the map, if they're saying it's supposed to hit California tomorrow, Alaska's a lot closer.
[02:16:38.573 --> 02:16:45.214]  And maybe it's true what the television stations reported yesterday, that they picked up radiation, but it was low-level, don't worry.
[02:16:45.214 --> 02:16:48.935]  But then in the article said, well, it isn't here yet, but we think it'll be low-level.
[02:16:48.935 --> 02:16:51.436]  I mean, all very, very suspicious.
[02:16:51.436 --> 02:16:53.996]  We'll continue to watch this as it unfolds.
[02:16:53.996 --> 02:16:56.717]  Michael in New York says he disagrees.
[02:16:56.717 --> 02:17:00.598]  So we'll skip Josh and Birch and go to them in a moment.
[02:17:00.598 --> 02:17:02.038]  Michael, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:17:02.038 --> 02:17:04.818]  Hi there.
[02:17:04.818 --> 02:17:07.339]  I wanted to talk about HAARP a little bit.
[02:17:08.319 --> 02:17:17.482]  I mean, I understand the concern about, you know, what's going to happen immediately now, but nobody really knows what this harp does.
[02:17:17.482 --> 02:17:27.606]  And we've had our own earthquakes here in Arkansas, and with all the birds dropping out of the air right before they had their earthquakes.
[02:17:27.606 --> 02:17:34.208]  And then the entire Pacific plate has had activity around it, except California.
[02:17:35.203 --> 02:17:40.554]  And I just think that we need to be talking a little more about harp and what exactly does it do.
[02:17:41.650 --> 02:17:46.034]  Well, ma'am, you may not have heard our broadcast, Michelle.
[02:17:46.034 --> 02:17:47.415]  Sorry if I called you Michael.
[02:17:47.415 --> 02:17:49.917]  I'm looking across the room here at the names.
[02:17:49.917 --> 02:17:51.819]  But we have covered HAARP a lot over the years.
[02:17:51.819 --> 02:17:55.262]  We sell videos and books by Dr. Nick Begich on it.
[02:17:55.262 --> 02:17:58.205]  I've interviewed the head, the director of HAARP.
[02:17:58.205 --> 02:18:03.349]  We know that it is involved in weather modification and reportedly manipulating the magnetic field of the Earth.
[02:18:03.349 --> 02:18:07.233]  But we know last 11th, March 11th, on Friday,
[02:18:07.873 --> 02:18:24.306]  That hours before the mega tsunami and earthquake, a huge solar flare, one of the biggest ever recorded to directly hit the Earth, that is the magnetic energy from it, hit the Antarctic, and even mainstream news was predicting earthquakes from it.
[02:18:24.306 --> 02:18:32.793]  And we have the moon, and we've had an astrophysicist on, who's Pierce Corbin, saying he believes the two things together, clearly the moon, and when it's closer,
[02:18:33.513 --> 02:18:40.197]  You have higher tides, you know, higher waves, and it also pulls magma bulging towards the moon with its gravity.
[02:18:40.197 --> 02:18:52.683]  And so, Piers Corbin, who's highly respected, has an incredible prediction right over 85% a year out on severe weather, believes it was the combo of the moon being closed and that solar flare that caused it.
[02:18:52.683 --> 02:18:56.265]  I mean, it wasn't HAARP that caused Pompeii 2,000 years ago.
[02:18:56.265 --> 02:19:01.467]  It wasn't HAARP that caused Krakatoa, you know, 80-something years ago to go off.
[02:19:01.467 --> 02:19:02.288]  I mean, do you see what I'm saying?
[02:19:03.396 --> 02:19:04.397]  No, I understand that.
[02:19:04.397 --> 02:19:11.784]  I know you've covered it in the past, but what I meant was just, you know, talking about HAARP in relation to this disaster.
[02:19:11.784 --> 02:19:13.205]  That's, you know, what I'm saying.
[02:19:13.205 --> 02:19:21.513]  Well, you must have missed me reading Secretary of Defense William Cohen in 97 in Army Times admitting that there are governments with earthquake weapons.
[02:19:21.513 --> 02:19:23.255]  But yes, I think we should talk about it more.
[02:19:23.740 --> 02:19:25.301]  In fact, that's a great guy to get on.
[02:19:25.301 --> 02:19:27.641]  Let's get Dr. Nick Begich on the next few days.
[02:19:27.641 --> 02:19:30.062]  Let's get him on tomorrow or on the Sunday broadcast.
[02:19:30.062 --> 02:19:33.763]  He's a great guy to have on to talk about that.
[02:19:33.763 --> 02:19:35.644]  Thank you, Michelle, for pointing that out.
[02:19:35.644 --> 02:19:36.624]  We do need to cover that more.
[02:19:36.624 --> 02:19:37.584]  You're right.
[02:19:37.584 --> 02:19:39.365]  We will start looking into it more.
[02:19:39.365 --> 02:19:40.925]  I'm mainly looking at the fallout.
[02:19:40.925 --> 02:19:42.106]  I got children.
[02:19:42.106 --> 02:19:45.487]  You know, you get older, you don't really care about yourself too much, you get resigned to death.
[02:19:46.227 --> 02:19:47.629]  I enjoy life, but you know what?
[02:19:47.629 --> 02:19:52.416]  It's coming, so gut up and... Kind of like jumping off a railroad trestle 300 feet into the water.
[02:19:52.416 --> 02:19:56.061]  You just gut up and know it's coming and... We're all gonna jump someday.
[02:19:56.061 --> 02:19:57.323]  We're all gonna die.
[02:19:57.323 --> 02:19:59.065]  My little babies, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:19:59.065 --> 02:20:00.147]  I'm very upset for them.
[02:20:01.547 --> 02:20:02.848]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:20:02.848 --> 02:20:08.431]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:20:08.431 --> 02:20:13.453]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:20:13.453 --> 02:20:18.476]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:20:19.016 --> 02:20:24.242]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:20:24.242 --> 02:20:31.370]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:20:31.370 --> 02:20:32.492]  And here's the best part.
[02:20:32.492 --> 02:20:38.839]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:20:39.159 --> 02:20:42.341]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:20:42.341 --> 02:20:44.563]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[02:20:44.563 --> 02:20:45.503]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:20:45.503 --> 02:20:45.703]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:20:45.703 --> 02:20:49.145]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:20:49.145 --> 02:20:50.867]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:21:01.218 --> 02:21:03.600]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:21:03.600 --> 02:21:05.901]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:21:05.901 --> 02:21:09.123]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:21:09.123 --> 02:21:14.227]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:21:14.227 --> 02:21:18.750]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:21:18.750 --> 02:21:21.091]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:21:21.091 --> 02:21:23.633]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:21:23.633 --> 02:21:26.495]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:21:26.875 --> 02:21:34.499]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:21:34.815 --> 02:21:40.216]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:21:40.216 --> 02:21:43.057]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:21:43.057 --> 02:21:46.737]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:21:46.737 --> 02:21:47.818]  And I got news for you.
[02:21:47.818 --> 02:21:49.158]  You're everyone else.

[02:24:16.735 --> 02:24:19.577]  The sun is gonna burn into a cinder.
[02:24:19.577 --> 02:24:25.440]  Before the radioactive half-life ends.
[02:24:25.440 --> 02:24:27.282]  And we're gonna rise.
[02:24:46.587 --> 02:24:52.729]  Man, it's hard to turn off the highway when we gotta do it to go back to your calls.
[02:24:52.729 --> 02:24:54.509]  On screen is the Drudge Report.
[02:25:07.626 --> 02:25:11.028]  And he is directly linked, of course, to the New York Times.
[02:25:11.028 --> 02:25:12.368]  Plume to hit U.S.
[02:25:12.368 --> 02:25:12.909]  Friday.
[02:25:12.909 --> 02:25:15.930]  Not normal, but not dangerous.
[02:25:15.930 --> 02:25:18.071]  Gotta love that doublespeak.
[02:25:18.071 --> 02:25:20.813]  Gotta absolutely love it.
[02:25:20.813 --> 02:25:22.414]  In your face.
[02:25:22.414 --> 02:25:25.655]  And we, of course, reported this days ago.
[02:25:25.655 --> 02:25:28.276]  Scientists project path of radiation plume.
[02:25:28.276 --> 02:25:32.679]  I'll be going over more of that with Dr. Bob Bowman in a moment.
[02:25:33.424 --> 02:25:35.425]  But you better watch what food you get.
[02:25:35.425 --> 02:25:42.428]  A lot of it gets shipped in from Asia, a lot of it gets shipped in from Hawaii, wherever this radiation plume goes.
[02:25:42.428 --> 02:25:49.911]  And while we're taking calls, I'm going to put that map of the first 10 days after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.
[02:25:49.911 --> 02:25:57.054]  And even the New York Times here admits they estimate a million people have died from complications of what happened from Chernobyl.
[02:25:57.054 --> 02:26:01.396]  That's the New York Times meteorologist from NOAA estimating.
[02:26:02.375 --> 02:26:02.876]  The Plume.
[02:26:11.331 --> 02:26:12.592]  I absolutely was not Alex.
[02:26:12.592 --> 02:26:15.895]  I was fortunate enough to get out of there just in time.
[02:26:40.957 --> 02:26:48.142]  Um, my friends that I'm speaking with in Chiba now are saying that they're being affected immediately.
[02:26:48.142 --> 02:26:55.566]  You know, bombing, uh, red faces, uh, red spots on their arms and legs all over the area.
[02:26:55.566 --> 02:26:56.286]  Let me stop you.
[02:26:56.286 --> 02:26:56.887]  Let me stop you.
[02:26:56.887 --> 02:26:58.128]  I'm going to have to hold you over.
[02:26:58.128 --> 02:26:59.648]  Lou, excuse me.
[02:26:59.648 --> 02:27:05.192]  We know they're not showing the readings for hundreds of miles around it, which is a super scary indicator.
[02:27:05.772 --> 02:27:08.193]  Thank you very much and I'm going to try and speak as briefly as I can about it.
[02:27:08.193 --> 02:27:10.653]  Just from what I'm hearing from the few people I'm talking to.
[02:27:31.489 --> 02:27:57.737]  In the Chiba, Japan area and the surrounding area that's east of Tokyo and then obviously north is where everything went down, people are experiencing these sort of these red blotches on their skins, vomiting, all these symptoms which are like flu-like and it's widespread.
[02:27:57.737 --> 02:27:59.538]  This isn't just like one or two people.
[02:27:59.946 --> 02:28:14.193]  From what I'm understanding from my friends out there, and I can't, you know, I'm not there, and there is a language barrier, but I do know them, that they are receiving that kind of, you know, massive fact already.
[02:28:14.193 --> 02:28:15.554]  They're already receiving this.
[02:28:15.554 --> 02:28:23.818]  And then after that, I'd like to go into the fact that there was a secret shipment of nuclear bomb material from Europe to Japan in 1999.
[02:28:25.123 --> 02:28:27.846]  Greenpeace had released this information.
[02:28:27.846 --> 02:28:37.237]  Now that was from mainly France, and it was enough they reported to run Japan for several hundred years, or to build over 10,000 bombs or warheads.
[02:28:37.237 --> 02:28:42.964]  I remember, and a bunch of countries wouldn't let it sail through their waters in the triple hull tankers.
[02:28:42.964 --> 02:28:45.087]  Yes, it's this MOX mixture.
[02:28:45.515 --> 02:28:50.219]  Which is actually weapon grade plutonium.
[02:28:50.219 --> 02:28:54.922]  And that is the entire thing in the big, you know, thing that blows the cover off this.
[02:28:54.922 --> 02:28:55.943]  You can look this up.
[02:28:55.943 --> 02:28:59.486]  I can send the whole thing Greenpeace did, the PDF.
[02:28:59.486 --> 02:29:00.447]  No, I remember that!
[02:29:00.447 --> 02:29:03.649]  Send it to ShowTipsAtInfoWars.com.
[02:29:03.649 --> 02:29:04.690]  I was on the air in 99.
[02:29:04.690 --> 02:29:10.134]  I remember the big hubbub over the ship from France to Japan.
[02:29:10.134 --> 02:29:11.796]  Yeah, and that to me
[02:29:12.443 --> 02:29:16.115]  Was just enough to really blow the top off this entire thing.
[02:29:16.115 --> 02:29:19.647]  And then, you know, thank you and God bless you for what you're doing for the American people.
[02:29:20.100 --> 02:29:24.561]  Because it's all indoctrination, and people have to get off the mainstream.
[02:29:24.561 --> 02:29:25.882]  They have to- Well, Lou, hold on.
[02:29:25.882 --> 02:29:26.742]  I'm just doing my job.
[02:29:26.742 --> 02:29:27.662]  Don't thank me.
[02:29:27.662 --> 02:29:31.243]  When we come back, Bowman's gonna be on, but I want him to hear what you have to say briefly.
[02:29:31.243 --> 02:29:33.964]  You're talking to your friends by email, by phone.
[02:29:33.964 --> 02:29:36.005]  They say they're getting radiation sickness.
[02:29:36.005 --> 02:29:42.227]  We need to hear specifically, even names if you can give it, because we need to get a report out confirming this, and I'm gonna do something else.
[02:29:43.286 --> 02:29:47.789]  I'm going to, unfortunately, we'll take your numbers and call you back.
[02:29:47.789 --> 02:29:51.971]  I'm going to clear the phone lines, except for Josh, for only Japanese callers.
[02:29:51.971 --> 02:29:53.372]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.372 --> 02:29:55.893]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.893 --> 02:29:58.575]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.822 --> 02:30:09.865]  Alex has told you that the Mideast uprisings over food prices and shortages caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide.
[02:30:09.865 --> 02:30:12.526]  We're seeing the impact right here in the United States.
[02:30:12.526 --> 02:30:21.569]  Ethanol, that was supposed to reduce petroleum use and fuel prices, hit a 30-month high in February, and pump prices are expected to reach $5 a gallon.
[02:30:21.569 --> 02:30:29.832]  Because of shipping costs, food is being priced out of the reach of millions of Americans, with an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days.
[02:30:29.832 --> 02:30:30.452]  Move quickly!
[02:30:30.572 --> 02:30:34.755]  Well, you can still afford it, and eFoodsDirect will pay your shipping costs for you.

[02:31:03.203 --> 02:31:05.404]  Subject to other police action.
[02:31:05.404 --> 02:31:06.664]  Tyranny is here.
[02:31:06.664 --> 02:31:10.346]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:31:10.346 --> 02:31:12.827]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:31:12.827 --> 02:31:18.689]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:31:18.689 --> 02:31:24.931]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:31:25.351 --> 02:31:31.314]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:31:31.314 --> 02:31:35.515]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:31:35.515 --> 02:31:39.797]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:31:39.797 --> 02:31:45.759]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[02:31:45.759 --> 02:31:49.301]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:31:49.301 --> 02:31:51.282]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:31:51.282 --> 02:31:51.722]  It's here.

[02:32:54.499 --> 02:32:54.939]  Thank you!
[02:33:07.617 --> 02:33:13.158]  Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you.
[02:33:13.158 --> 02:33:17.280]  By now you should have somehow realized what you gotta do.
[02:33:17.280 --> 02:33:29.703]  I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now.
[02:33:29.703 --> 02:33:33.664]  Backbeat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out.
[02:33:35.882 --> 02:33:52.656]  Okay, Dr. Bob Bowman is our guest for the next 30 minutes, perhaps a little bit in the next hour.
[02:33:52.656 --> 02:33:55.739]  We're going into station overdrive here.
[02:33:55.739 --> 02:34:00.623]  I am going to open the phones up only for people in Japan.
[02:34:00.623 --> 02:34:01.684]  They are not reporting
[02:34:02.284 --> 02:34:03.385]  We reported this yesterday.
[02:34:03.385 --> 02:34:11.733]  USA Today confirmed Japan and two of the states, the prefectures, are not reporting the radiation levels.
[02:34:11.733 --> 02:34:12.795]  It is a cover-up.
[02:34:12.795 --> 02:34:14.716]  The Pentagon knows what's going on.
[02:34:14.716 --> 02:34:16.018]  That's a cover-up.
[02:34:16.018 --> 02:34:20.602]  We have a devastatingly scary call from Lew in Illinois that just got back from Japan.
[02:34:21.383 --> 02:34:31.657]  He is saying that his friends there via email and Skype calls or tele-specific ways are reporting to him that they're getting the radiation sickness, the vomiting, the red spots.
[02:34:31.657 --> 02:34:35.322]  That's exactly what we would expect from serious exposure.
[02:34:35.322 --> 02:34:36.724]  I want Dr. Bob Bowman to hear a
[02:34:38.346 --> 02:34:53.489]  The area southeast of Fukushima, where you're getting these reports, what your friends are telling you, specifically, so that he can comment, and then we're going to, while we talk to Dr. Bob Bowman, put the number out.
[02:34:53.489 --> 02:35:00.191]  Now, many people can't call on a regular landline from Japan to a toll-free number, which is 1-800-259-9231.
[02:35:00.191 --> 02:35:01.931]  Do not call that number unless you're from Japan.
[02:35:06.403 --> 02:35:08.585]  Here is the regular landline number.
[02:35:08.585 --> 02:35:10.706]  It'll be on your dime, but we'll go right to you.
[02:35:10.706 --> 02:35:11.747]  Dr. Bowman understands.
[02:35:11.747 --> 02:35:14.309]  He can listen to you and comment and analyze it.
[02:35:14.309 --> 02:35:22.215]  If you're seeing radiation sickness or if you are living elsewhere in Japan and confirming reports by friends or family, here is the number, Japan.
[02:35:22.215 --> 02:35:26.319]  Dial your country access code to the United States and then 651.
[02:35:28.380 --> 02:35:29.501]  Six, nine, five.
[02:35:29.501 --> 02:35:31.762]  And guys, give me the US country code.
[02:35:31.762 --> 02:35:34.103]  John, get that and add that here, please.
[02:35:34.103 --> 02:35:34.363]  That's 651-695-7777.
[02:35:34.363 --> 02:35:34.443]  651-695-7777.
[02:35:34.443 --> 02:35:35.163]  Again, Japan.
[02:35:47.809 --> 02:35:51.831]  651-695-7777.
[02:35:51.831 --> 02:35:55.493]  And the military has a duty to not follow unlawful orders.
[02:35:55.493 --> 02:36:01.315]  You have a responsibility to contact Congress, to contact the media, and to tell them what your meters are picking up.
[02:36:01.315 --> 02:36:03.896]  We know the ships ran away Monday when Fukushima No.
[02:36:03.896 --> 02:36:06.778]  3, Blue Sky High, the MaxCorp plutonium-based reactor.
[02:36:07.278 --> 02:36:07.799]  6-5-1-6-9-5-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7
[02:36:26.899 --> 02:36:31.162]  9231, we just wiped the phone lines, except for Lou.
[02:36:31.162 --> 02:36:35.785]  They have reported flights in out of Tokyo, do have radiation into O'Hare.
[02:36:35.785 --> 02:36:39.188]  They're letting them go with the bags, with everything, even though there's radiation.
[02:36:39.188 --> 02:36:41.910]  We're talking to Bob, Dr. Bob Bowman, here in just a moment.
[02:36:41.910 --> 02:36:44.752]  He's waiting in the wings via video Skype from his home in Florida.
[02:36:44.752 --> 02:36:49.155]  Former head of the Star Wars program, three degrees a nuclear physicist, in nuclear physics.
[02:36:49.855 --> 02:36:54.056]  But I wanted you to give a report, Lou, to Dr. Bowman.
[02:36:54.056 --> 02:36:54.876]  Take your time.
[02:36:54.876 --> 02:37:01.418]  Exactly who these friends are, where you were in Japan, what they're now telling you about the radiation sickness for Dr. Bowman.
[02:37:01.418 --> 02:37:01.998]  Take your time.
[02:37:01.998 --> 02:37:03.098]  You got three minutes.
[02:37:03.098 --> 02:37:06.319]  Earlier you wanted to hurry because you know time is... Your intel is key.
[02:37:06.319 --> 02:37:08.779]  Report to Dr. Bowman who's listening right now.
[02:37:08.779 --> 02:37:19.262]  I was in the Chiba area of Japan and I was there for setting up martial arts studios or helping a friend who
[02:37:20.023 --> 02:37:26.345]  I would like to remain named anonymous because their government is very different.
[02:37:26.345 --> 02:37:30.707]  They work and they're very dedicated to their government.
[02:37:30.707 --> 02:37:33.888]  So I don't know if they would be willing to come forward about this.
[02:37:33.888 --> 02:37:44.291]  But there is a very high amount of integrity in what I'm saying because the people that the information is coming from are highly dedicated martial arts students.
[02:37:45.100 --> 02:37:45.681]  Okay.
[02:37:45.681 --> 02:37:47.603]  Um, my face is red.
[02:37:47.603 --> 02:38:01.637]  I'm feeling, you know, like I've gotten sunburn or splotches on their leg, red splotches, areas, hands going numb, um, earaches, vomiting, big, gigantic headaches.
[02:38:01.637 --> 02:38:06.882]  You know, these types of things are what I'm hearing from friends of friends of friends.
[02:38:07.501 --> 02:38:08.261]  Of course!
[02:38:24.758 --> 02:38:31.744]  Uh, not that I would want to lie to them and I want them to know the truth and whatever precautionary actions they could take.
[02:38:31.744 --> 02:38:39.631]  However, you know, these are the symptoms that I'm being reported to from a small, you know, this is a microcosm group of people.
[02:38:39.631 --> 02:38:52.402]  I can't claim that, you know, this is happening everywhere, but from the people that I am talking to, they are absolutely receiving, you know, splotches all over their bodies, numbness, vomiting, redness of the face.
[02:38:52.981 --> 02:38:58.283]  Earaches, headaches, flu-like symptoms.
[02:38:58.283 --> 02:39:00.724]  Okay, sir.
[02:39:00.724 --> 02:39:01.945]  Please continue reporting to Bowman.
[02:39:01.945 --> 02:39:02.345]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:39:02.345 --> 02:39:02.985]  I thought you were done.
[02:39:02.985 --> 02:39:04.066]  Go ahead.
[02:39:04.066 --> 02:39:05.926]  No, that's pretty much it.
[02:39:05.926 --> 02:39:08.528]  It's a very small area.
[02:39:08.528 --> 02:39:10.468]  This isn't hundreds of people.
[02:39:10.468 --> 02:39:12.929]  This is several dozen people.
[02:39:12.929 --> 02:39:19.152]  And I think it's big news because it does show that there are people out there with these type of symptoms.
[02:39:19.711 --> 02:39:38.659]  And I didn't want to say that and so I went and looked up at myself what the specifics are of radiation poison or how fast you can be affected by that because, you know, maybe they're just having delusions or they're upset or they're, you know, you see this place and it's the devastation around you.
[02:39:38.659 --> 02:39:43.341]  You could have an anxiety attack which makes you think that as well.
[02:39:43.341 --> 02:39:46.703]  So, you know, I'm trying to give them hope but at the same time there are
[02:39:47.208 --> 02:39:56.275]  Tons and tons of people, you know, dozens of people from France that I know that are complaining of very similar symptoms.
[02:39:56.275 --> 02:40:00.778]  Redness, numbness, flu-like vomiting, all this stuff that's going on.
[02:40:00.778 --> 02:40:08.604]  Is that a possibility or are they, you know, just kind of freaking out is my whole question to them, really.
[02:40:08.604 --> 02:40:11.646]  You know, I don't know, but this is what they're telling me.
[02:40:11.646 --> 02:40:13.047]  Okay, let me ask this.
[02:40:13.047 --> 02:40:15.309]  How far are they from the reactor?
[02:40:16.511 --> 02:40:42.317]  Okay, we're looking at Chiba, Japan is south, so an actual mile, if I was to Google Earth that, just to look, I mean, Fukushima is north, we're looking at a scale of 200 miles, would be my estimate, which is, it's east, Chiba is east, exactly east of Japan, or what, yeah, east of Tokyo, I'm sorry.
[02:40:43.965 --> 02:40:49.951]  Okay, so it's east of Tokyo, sort of on the coast.
[02:40:49.951 --> 02:40:55.357]  Sort of on the coast, but inside it's like a little Florida type of peninsula.
[02:40:57.136 --> 02:41:22.669]  Okay, well, my answer to you is I'm not surprised, and I'm not a medical doctor, but I'm afraid that sounds exactly like radiation sickness, and it's not surprising considering the level of radiation that has come out of that plant and the distance that they are.
[02:41:22.669 --> 02:41:25.351]  Now, you know, if I was getting this report,
[02:41:26.670 --> 02:41:37.354]  From somebody in Illinois, I would say it's psychosomatic, your fears are getting the best of you, it can't be radiation sickness.
[02:41:37.354 --> 02:41:47.657]  But coming from there, I'd say it almost certainly is, I'm afraid.
[02:41:47.657 --> 02:41:56.180]  Yes, and then of course I went into a conversation with Alex about this Greenpeace, speaking about this weapon-grade plutonium that
[02:41:56.684 --> 02:41:57.604]  Yeah, I've been there.
[02:42:26.966 --> 02:42:33.709]  Yeah, and then to think that it's going to come to America and just like Alex said with the children and, you know, does it blow up to Chicago too?
[02:42:33.709 --> 02:42:38.350]  I mean, what are the, I mean, the mass effect of this, you know, this is big.
[02:42:38.350 --> 02:42:45.233]  And I'm just, you know, if they're feeling that already, uh, there, there is absolutely some type of evidence.
[02:42:45.233 --> 02:42:47.214]  And, you know, this is several dozen people.
[02:42:47.214 --> 02:42:49.755]  It's not the world though, a microcosm.
[02:42:49.755 --> 02:42:52.616]  We're still looking at, you know, evidence here that, Hey,
[02:42:52.961 --> 02:42:57.983]  You know, there is something happening out there and it's a lot more than we, uh, think.
[02:42:57.983 --> 02:43:06.107]  And, you know, I thank them for the information, but they're in my hopes and prayers every minute that I could pray, you know, for them because this is, it's serious.
[02:43:06.107 --> 02:43:10.109]  You know, I wouldn't have made this call if I didn't think this was serious.
[02:43:10.109 --> 02:43:11.189]  Yeah.
[02:43:11.189 --> 02:43:18.972]  Well, uh, I can assure you that the similar thing is not going to happen in Chicago.
[02:43:18.972 --> 02:43:19.012]  Uh,
[02:43:21.587 --> 02:43:28.851]  Radiation dissipates with the cube of the distance.
[02:43:28.851 --> 02:43:40.638]  And so there is an enormous difference between 200 miles and 6,000 miles.
[02:43:40.638 --> 02:43:44.340]  The difference is like 270,000.
[02:43:44.340 --> 02:43:50.904]  So have we and I apologize for interrupting you, sir, but have we
[02:43:51.431 --> 02:43:59.838]  Do we have this kind of information on this type of plutonium or this specifically?
[02:43:59.838 --> 02:44:00.458]  Do we know?
[02:44:00.458 --> 02:44:03.561]  Do the American people even know the repercussions of this?
[02:44:03.561 --> 02:44:12.508]  Do we have any data to go by to say that that's absolute with the potency of this particular type of uranium?
[02:44:17.813 --> 02:44:31.059]  The fears come when, particularly in the MOX reactor, where you have a mixture of uranium oxide and plutonium oxide.
[02:44:31.059 --> 02:44:45.945]  The plutonium, if it gets caught up in the jet stream and carried all the way across the ocean to the United States and particles fall out, it's possible to breathe one of those particles in.
[02:44:47.609 --> 02:44:54.994]  And in that case, there is a good chance that sometime in the next 50 years you're going to come down with cancer.
[02:44:58.177 --> 02:45:12.449]  There is essentially no chance, from what I know, of anyone in the United States coming down with radiation sickness, splotches, nausea, vomiting, headaches, that kind of thing.
[02:45:12.449 --> 02:45:19.235]  There just isn't enough radiation by the time it gets to the United States to do that.
[02:45:21.397 --> 02:45:29.319]  Let me just interject here for a moment, specifically, and Lou, I appreciate your phone call, God bless you.
[02:45:29.319 --> 02:45:46.262]  Undoubtedly, if they're not giving us radiation levels, and we've seen four of the plants explode, several of them sky-high, there's 600,000 spent fuel rods, we now know many of them were contained on top of the facilities that blew up, that there's a huge cover-up, the Pentagon has readings, they know what's going on, they're not saying anything.
[02:45:46.262 --> 02:45:48.083]  A doctor
[02:45:48.923 --> 02:45:52.484]  A lot of experts are in the news saying this may have already gone Chernobyl.
[02:45:52.484 --> 02:45:55.345]  They admit that two of the containment facilities have been breached.
[02:45:55.345 --> 02:46:03.647]  They're talking about radiation levels so high they may pull out all of the relief effort with the Fukushima 50 who say they're willing to die and that they may die.
[02:46:03.647 --> 02:46:08.548]  I mean, if this is indeed going on, this looks like it could be bigger than Chernobyl, correct?
[02:46:10.043 --> 02:46:10.823]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:46:10.823 --> 02:46:16.066]  And I've been saying that for a number of days, that it could be bigger than Chernobyl.
[02:46:16.066 --> 02:46:21.409]  And for the people of Japan, it is absolutely catastrophic.
[02:46:21.409 --> 02:46:27.092]  And the winds, the low-level winds, can be fickle.
[02:46:27.092 --> 02:46:35.976]  And they can turn, where they're generally blowing from west to east, they can turn and blow from the north to the south toward Tokyo.
[02:46:35.976 --> 02:46:39.238]  And they've done that on occasion already.
[02:46:40.038 --> 02:46:42.140]  For brief periods.
[02:46:42.140 --> 02:46:53.688]  And so the people in Tokyo are at risk of radiation sickness and death from this.
[02:46:53.688 --> 02:47:06.216]  So I don't want to minimize this because to the people of Japan, it is probably worse than Chernobyl already.
[02:47:07.516 --> 02:47:17.570]  And the area around the plant may never be habitable again.
[02:47:20.209 --> 02:47:35.202]  But I do say that the people of the United States should not panic and go out and start taking iodine pills because it's a waste and it's damaging to your thyroid.
[02:47:35.202 --> 02:47:40.066]  The use for those pills is when you know that you have been exposed
[02:47:41.243 --> 02:47:45.705]  And that's the time to take those pills.
[02:47:45.705 --> 02:47:59.210]  When you're in danger of radiation sickness, the iodine pills cannot prevent you from inhaling a radioactive particle that over a period of years can give you cancer.
[02:48:00.322 --> 02:48:02.003]  Iodine pills can't help with that.
[02:48:02.003 --> 02:48:17.047]  All iodine can do is keep the radioactive stuff from getting into your thyroid and causing immediate radiation sickness and death.
[02:48:17.047 --> 02:48:19.607]  The iodine can be helpful for that.
[02:48:19.607 --> 02:48:21.168]  So you have to understand
[02:48:22.929 --> 02:48:27.913]  When it's called for and when it isn't, and not get clanked up.
[02:48:27.913 --> 02:48:42.025]  Now, the people in the Aleutian Islands and Alaska are more vulnerable than we are in the continental United States.
[02:48:42.025 --> 02:48:50.772]  Hawaii, unless the jet stream dips unusually, may escape most of it.
[02:48:52.846 --> 02:49:14.009]  So, you really don't know, but yes, it's probably worse than Chernobyl, but and Chernobyl caused enormous consequences in Eastern Germany and in Finland.
[02:49:15.479 --> 02:49:29.205]  And in areas that initially didn't expect to be hit because they were west of Chernobyl, not east of Chernobyl, but they did get affected.
[02:49:29.205 --> 02:49:40.210]  The fallout from these freak lower level winds and any little higher low can do that.
[02:49:40.210 --> 02:49:43.092]  The fallout got into the grass
[02:49:44.415 --> 02:49:44.455]  In
[02:50:00.188 --> 02:50:07.673]  Hogs in Germany ate them and their meat became radioactive.
[02:50:07.673 --> 02:50:18.179]  One thing we have to be concerned about is the food chain in the ocean and how the radioactive particles that fall out into the ocean, and I think most of it will,
[02:50:21.212 --> 02:50:26.996]  can possibly get into the food chain and up to the fish that we eat.
[02:50:26.996 --> 02:50:39.704]  Now, that may not happen, but I'm not familiar with the mechanisms of the food chain and how that radioactivity can get to them, but there is a possibility.
[02:50:39.704 --> 02:50:40.864]  Dr. Bob Bowman, stay there.
[02:50:40.864 --> 02:50:44.967]  Can you ride shotgun with us a little bit in the next hour and take calls from Australia and Japan?
[02:50:48.297 --> 02:50:48.837]  Okay, good.
[02:50:48.837 --> 02:50:49.838]  He says he can.
[02:50:49.838 --> 02:50:55.181]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, on the other side of this quick break going into overdrive in the fourth hour today.
[02:50:55.181 --> 02:51:00.144]  If your AM and FM doesn't carry it, InfoWars.com, PrisonBlinded.tv to watch and listen.
[02:51:00.144 --> 02:51:00.664]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:02.133 --> 02:51:07.339]  How well and how fast does heart and body extract work to improve blood circulation?
[02:51:07.339 --> 02:51:08.039]  Listen.
[02:51:08.039 --> 02:51:12.304]  My name is Ellis and I'm 66 years old and I live in Jacksonville, Florida.
[02:51:12.304 --> 02:51:15.708]  Two years ago, I was diagnosed as having clogged arteries.
[02:51:15.708 --> 02:51:18.751]  I had 70% blockage in one artery leading to my heart.
[02:51:18.751 --> 02:51:22.115]  They wanted me to go on Plavix, but I refused knowing the negative side effects.
[02:51:22.506 --> 02:51:30.931]  Heart and body extract is a unique balance, synergy, and proportion of herbs reaching from head to toe at maximum absorption around 95% at the cellular level.
[02:51:30.931 --> 02:51:33.492]  Within the first month, I felt a dramatic difference.
[02:51:33.492 --> 02:51:37.855]  The heaviness in my legs was reduced, and within two months, I felt completely normal.
[02:51:38.083 --> 02:51:42.286]  Your natural organic herbal formula for heart health is Heart and Body Extract.
[02:51:42.286 --> 02:51:46.489]  Heart and Body Extract comes with a 100% ironclad money back guarantee.

[02:52:02.296 --> 02:52:06.320]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:06.320 --> 02:52:09.543]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:09.543 --> 02:52:14.347]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:14.347 --> 02:52:20.753]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:20.753 --> 02:52:22.996]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:52:23.516 --> 02:52:23.816]  Tim Geithner?
[02:52:23.816 --> 02:52:24.336]  Bernanke?
[02:52:24.336 --> 02:52:24.717]  They're arsonists!
[02:52:24.717 --> 02:52:25.457]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:25.457 --> 02:52:27.798]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:42.426 --> 02:52:49.715]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:52:49.715 --> 02:52:58.827]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:53:00.569 --> 02:53:02.910]  The collapse of the dollar is imminent.
[02:53:02.910 --> 02:53:07.073]  You can protect your wealth by buying gold, silver, and strong foreign currencies.
[02:53:07.073 --> 02:53:13.796]  But what if the government confiscates your precious metals, implements exchange controls, or nationalizes your retirement?
[02:53:13.796 --> 02:53:15.077]  You need a backup plan.
[02:53:15.077 --> 02:53:18.879]  That's why you must move your wealth into an offshore asset protection structure.
[02:53:19.059 --> 02:53:31.930]  Go to CollapseProof.com to get your free special report and discover how to store your gold and silver in the world's safest vaults or how to hold foreign currencies in a way that's safe from bank failures, bank runs, or exchange controls.

[02:53:32.631 --> 02:53:39.236]  government failed to collect a $36 million claim because the defendant legally used an offshore asset protection program.
[02:53:39.236 --> 02:53:44.641]  This is what you need to keep your wealth safe when the dollar collapses and CollapseProof.com can help.

[02:53:54.707 --> 02:53:57.088]  CollapseProof.com.
[02:53:57.088 --> 02:54:03.912]  Asset protection in financially unsafe times.
[02:54:03.912 --> 02:54:07.834]  I remember when I remember I remember when I lost my mind
[02:54:09.858 --> 02:54:10.680]  Hello, Ansugi.
[02:54:10.680 --> 02:54:11.481]  Kevin Gardner here.
[02:54:11.481 --> 02:54:13.826]  It is 1340 on Thursday afternoon, St.
[02:54:13.826 --> 02:54:14.728]  Paddy's Day, and I got...
[02:54:20.188 --> 02:54:22.430]  Some news that needs to get out.
[02:54:22.430 --> 02:54:30.236]  I know there's been a lot of rumors going on, and I'm here to probably confirm some of those rumors.
[02:54:30.236 --> 02:54:48.690]  So, I just got out of a VTC with Commander Naval Forces Japan, and I'm going to tell you, the President of the United States has authorized a military-assisted, voluntary departure of dependents from Japan.
[02:54:49.537 --> 02:54:51.279]  So what does that mean?
[02:54:51.279 --> 02:55:07.377]  That means within the next 24 hours there will be Air Force cargo, Air Force passenger airplanes landing here at Atsugi and taking first women and children out of here
[02:55:08.516 --> 02:55:16.599]  Most likely over to Korea for one or two days and then for further transfer to some other place.
[02:55:16.599 --> 02:55:22.861]  Whether that's the United States or that part of it has not come through with the plan yet.
[02:55:25.367 --> 02:55:30.853]  The first phase of the equipment is going to be Pacific Air Force aircraft.
[02:55:30.853 --> 02:55:32.194]  They're going to fly into Narita.
[02:55:32.194 --> 02:55:34.136]  They're going to fly into Yokota.
[02:55:34.136 --> 02:55:36.078]  And they're going to fly into Atsugi.
[02:55:36.078 --> 02:55:40.923]  And we're going to take family members out of here.
[02:55:42.332 --> 02:55:43.293]  Oh yeah, that's a good idea.
[02:56:14.798 --> 02:56:31.158]  I tell you, watching those explosions and the hundreds of thousands of fuel rods and the smoking and the fires still ongoing, as a nuclear physicist, as a combat pilot, as a former head of the Star Wars program, what would you do if you were President Obama right now?
[02:56:31.158 --> 02:56:34.122]  Would you be doing NCAA basketball picks on TV?
[02:56:36.960 --> 02:56:41.865]  Well, there's a lot of stuff that I would be doing that he's not doing.
[02:56:41.865 --> 02:56:47.471]  I think getting the women and children out of Japan is a good idea.
[02:56:47.471 --> 02:56:49.293]  I would go further than that.
[02:56:49.293 --> 02:56:56.301]  Any military personnel in Japan that can't assist in the relief effort and in
[02:56:58.506 --> 02:57:01.287]  Taking care of survivors.
[02:57:01.287 --> 02:57:03.247]  They should be pulled out, too.
[02:57:03.247 --> 02:57:17.191]  As a matter of fact, of course, my position for a long time is that we ought to bring home all our troops from the 700 bases we have around the world and give the bases all back.
[02:57:17.191 --> 02:57:24.453]  You know, after 66 years, I think it's time to end the occupation of Germany and Japan and
[02:57:28.158 --> 02:57:32.363]  Use our military to protect our borders and our people, period.
[02:57:32.363 --> 02:57:39.552]  And quit having this overseas empire, which puts our troops at risk.
[02:57:39.552 --> 02:57:46.501]  But don't get me wrong, since they're there, using them to actually help the people of Japan, I'm all for that.
[02:57:47.342 --> 02:57:53.605]  I just don't find sitting around there to be part of the empire building.
[02:57:53.605 --> 02:57:54.005]  Sure, sure.
[02:57:54.005 --> 02:57:56.687]  But doctor, we're seeing a pull out.
[02:57:56.687 --> 02:58:00.068]  That certainly signifies that things have deteriorated.
[02:58:00.068 --> 02:58:03.570]  Of course they have.
[02:58:03.570 --> 02:58:06.511]  He looked pretty shook up when he was on there.
[02:58:06.511 --> 02:58:11.734]  You couldn't see the video, but the viewers could and the listeners can go see it on InfoWars.com.
[02:58:11.734 --> 02:58:15.536]  He looked like he was trying to control himself and like he was hiding something.
[02:58:17.381 --> 02:58:20.102]  Well, not surprising.
[02:58:20.102 --> 02:58:21.222]  Dr. Bowman, stay there.
[02:58:21.222 --> 02:58:23.643]  Calls from Australia straight ahead.
[02:58:23.643 --> 02:58:26.603]  Japan, are you experiencing radiation sickness?
[02:58:26.603 --> 02:58:27.484]  Are you vomiting?
[02:58:27.484 --> 02:58:29.084]  Is your skin getting red?
[02:58:29.084 --> 02:58:30.044]  Country code, 001-0041-1651-695-7777.
[02:58:30.044 --> 02:58:31.445]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:31.445 --> 02:58:33.505]  Fourth hour straight ahead.
[02:58:45.339 --> 02:58:49.330]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:58:51.701 --> 02:58:56.244]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:58:56.244 --> 02:58:57.164]  Number 1.
[02:58:57.164 --> 02:59:00.587]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:59:00.587 --> 02:59:01.447]  Number 2.
[02:59:01.447 --> 02:59:06.330]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:59:06.330 --> 02:59:07.091]  It's true.
[02:59:07.091 --> 02:59:11.954]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:59:11.954 --> 02:59:12.774]  Number 3.
[02:59:12.774 --> 02:59:16.377]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:59:16.377 --> 02:59:20.059]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:59:20.259 --> 02:59:21.059]  Number 4.
[02:59:21.059 --> 02:59:23.821]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:59:23.821 --> 02:59:27.503]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:59:27.503 --> 02:59:28.303]  Number 5.
[02:59:28.303 --> 02:59:32.445]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:59:32.445 --> 02:59:37.488]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:59:37.488 --> 02:59:41.670]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:41.670 --> 02:59:43.451]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:43.451 --> 02:59:48.053]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[02:59:48.353 --> 02:59:49.514]  877-327-0365.
[02:59:49.514 --> 02:59:54.216]  Coast to Coast.
[02:59:54.216 --> 02:59:56.258]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:56.258 --> 02:59:59.479]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:24.045 --> 03:00:27.548]  Daniel, Paul, Jack, and others, we're going to your calls.
[03:00:27.548 --> 03:00:30.330]  Dr. Bob Bowman with us for another 20 minutes or so.
[03:00:30.330 --> 03:00:34.414]  We are in overdrive, ladies and gentlemen, today.
[03:00:34.414 --> 03:00:47.065]  Covering the deteriorating situation in Japan, the cover-up unraveling, the winds, according to NOAA, National Weather and Oceanic Association, Federal Government Weather Services, they may start hitting tomorrow on the West Coast.
[03:00:47.065 --> 03:00:49.987]  Landfall around Los Angeles couldn't be any worse, if you ask me.
[03:00:53.353 --> 03:00:55.134]  Jack says he's in Japan.
[03:00:55.134 --> 03:00:58.456]  Jack, where are you in Japan?
[03:00:58.456 --> 03:01:00.137]  Hello, are you still there?
[03:01:00.137 --> 03:01:00.977]  Yes, sir.
[03:01:00.977 --> 03:01:03.659]  You're in Japan, correct, Jack?
[03:01:03.659 --> 03:01:10.943]  Yeah, I'm here about 200 kilometers southwest of the vent in Fukushima.
[03:01:10.943 --> 03:01:11.543]  Wow.
[03:01:11.543 --> 03:01:12.544]  Tell us what you're witnessing.
[03:01:13.905 --> 03:01:22.533]  Well, basically, you know, the Japanese people themselves, they're staying cool, they're staying calm, and I really have to give it up to them.
[03:01:22.533 --> 03:01:32.061]  They're really, you know, considering the seriousness of this event, they're really... Are you seeing any radiation sickness?
[03:01:32.061 --> 03:01:33.742]  No, but I can tell you that...
[03:01:34.884 --> 03:01:52.586]  On the website that I have for my own local area here, we are showing elevated signs of radiation, basically something around the area of ten times the amount of radiation that we get in a regular day here in Spain.
[03:01:52.586 --> 03:01:53.447]  How many times, sir?
[03:01:54.642 --> 03:01:55.422]  Ten times.
[03:01:55.422 --> 03:01:56.703]  Ten times!
[03:01:56.703 --> 03:02:02.465]  And we had a doctor of physics on earlier explaining that it's the internal ingestion that makes it much more deadly.
[03:02:02.465 --> 03:02:05.746]  Dr. Bob Bowman, three degrees in physics, is with us.
[03:02:05.746 --> 03:02:08.087]  Sir, we know about the Japanese sites.
[03:02:08.087 --> 03:02:18.130]  Can you tell us the address or the headline of the prefectory or the county that you're in that is showing the ten times?
[03:02:18.130 --> 03:02:20.431]  Yes, I'm in Gunma.
[03:02:20.431 --> 03:02:21.071]  How do you spell that?
[03:02:22.208 --> 03:02:25.089]  Uh, G-U-N-M-A.
[03:02:25.089 --> 03:02:29.351]  Say it again, G-U... N-M-A.
[03:02:29.351 --> 03:02:31.032]  G-U... N-M-A.
[03:02:31.032 --> 03:02:33.833]  G-U-N-M-A, so Gunma.
[03:02:33.833 --> 03:02:35.414]  That's correct.
[03:02:35.414 --> 03:02:36.154]  Okay.
[03:02:36.154 --> 03:02:40.997]  If someone wanted to check it out, it's www.P-R-E-F.G-U-N-M-A.J-P.
[03:02:49.929 --> 03:02:51.390]  Okay, we're writing that down again.
[03:02:51.390 --> 03:02:52.091]  Copy again.
[03:02:52.091 --> 03:03:10.343]  That's w-w-w-dot-p-r-e-f-dot-g-u-n-m-a-dot-j-p.
[03:03:10.343 --> 03:03:11.564]  And that's been the key for three days.
[03:03:11.564 --> 03:03:14.947]  We've looked at these and haven't hardly shown them on air.
[03:03:14.947 --> 03:03:16.748]  Read us what it says to Dr. Bob Bowman.
[03:03:18.257 --> 03:03:33.885]  Well, basically what I've got right now is, let's see, in terms of millisieverts, is what they're telling us, 0.091.
[03:03:33.885 --> 03:03:42.670]  And two days ago, when I called you a couple of days ago, when you had Dr. Bob Bowman on, we had 0.501.
[03:03:47.853 --> 03:03:53.696]  But yeah, we've got .091 right now.
[03:03:53.696 --> 03:03:55.656]  I'm gonna have you hold, sir, as we're about to go to break.
[03:03:55.656 --> 03:03:57.857]  Stay there, but briefly in a minute and a half we've got.
[03:03:57.857 --> 03:03:59.398]  Dr. Bowman, what does that sound like to you?
[03:04:01.004 --> 03:04:17.487]  Well, it's fairly good news because ten times background radiation is something that Tokyo has been experiencing all along, with momentary spikes higher than that when the wind shifts.
[03:04:17.487 --> 03:04:28.089]  So that's about as low as you can expect it to have for some time, and generally that's not enough to cause radiation sickness.
[03:04:28.089 --> 03:04:29.489]  The people that
[03:04:30.189 --> 03:04:41.315]  We were hearing about earlier that are suffering from radiation sickness are probably those that are getting closer to a thousand times the background radiation.
[03:04:42.699 --> 03:04:45.543]  Okay, we're on the site and do see those numbers.
[03:04:45.543 --> 03:04:54.654]  Most of it's in Japanese, but on air when we come back with the caller from Australia and Dr. Bowman, we'll have the caller who obviously speaks Japanese and can read it.
[03:04:54.654 --> 03:05:00.722]  We'll have Jack, as this is on screen, describe it for us and read it for us and show us where to focus in.
[03:05:00.722 --> 03:05:01.182]  Stay with us.

[03:06:01.538 --> 03:06:03.939]  They helped to create a new world order.
[03:06:03.939 --> 03:06:06.240]  We are part of a new world order.
[03:06:06.240 --> 03:06:09.461]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[03:06:09.461 --> 03:06:14.202]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:06:14.562 --> 03:06:19.066]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:06:19.066 --> 03:06:21.528]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:06:21.528 --> 03:06:24.311]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:06:24.311 --> 03:06:27.213]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:06:27.213 --> 03:06:34.820]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:06:35.157 --> 03:06:40.538]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:06:40.538 --> 03:06:42.859]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:06:42.859 --> 03:06:47.080]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:06:47.080 --> 03:06:48.140]  And I got news for you.
[03:06:48.140 --> 03:06:49.480]  You're everyone else.
[03:06:49.480 --> 03:06:50.981]  Invisible Empire.

[03:07:00.421 --> 03:07:03.943]  There's a man named Dr. Wallach who is anything but your typical doctor.
[03:07:03.943 --> 03:07:14.710]  Both a veterinarian and naturopathic physician, Doc asks, why does the United States spend more money on healthcare by far and still rank 50th in health and longevity worldwide?
[03:07:14.710 --> 03:07:23.876]  He believes that people should empower themselves with a basic understanding of nutrition, taking charge of their life, and attain optimal health and longevity through nutrition,
[03:07:24.296 --> 03:07:27.539]  Not by toxic prescription drugs, leading to side effects.
[03:07:27.539 --> 03:07:29.520]  This is clearly a deadly recipe.
[03:07:29.520 --> 03:07:39.087]  The good news is, Doc Wallach's message is resonating with an increasing number of Americans who are waking up to all the big government and big pharma manipulation of our healthcare system.
[03:07:39.087 --> 03:07:46.373]  I like what Doc Wallach is saying and doing to enlighten people about healthcare, and have joined forces to help this tireless crusader spread his message.
[03:07:46.833 --> 03:07:51.702]  Visit InfoWarsTeam.com and listen to Dr. Wallach's Deadly Recipes lecture.
[03:07:51.702 --> 03:07:55.668]  It makes a lot of sense, and I want you to join our InfoWars Team.
[03:07:55.668 --> 03:07:57.852]  Go to InfoWarsTeam.com.
[03:07:57.852 --> 03:08:00.116]  That's InfoWarsTeam.com.
[03:08:02.799 --> 03:08:09.405]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:09.405 --> 03:08:13.829]  It is Thursday, the 17th day of March, 2011.
[03:08:13.829 --> 03:08:19.935]  Dr. Bob Bowman, nuclear physicist, also degrees in aeronautics, is our guest.
[03:08:19.935 --> 03:08:21.557]  We're talking to Jack in Japan.
[03:08:21.557 --> 03:08:26.802]  We'll go next to Australia in a moment, but we'll put on screen the particular
[03:08:28.300 --> 03:08:28.580]  I think?
[03:08:46.688 --> 03:08:53.332]  Uh, and of course we know most of the radiation is going out in the sea, just a little bit of it went south, uh, into Tokyo and surrounding areas.
[03:08:53.332 --> 03:09:02.076]  Can we trust these numbers with Japan's famous record, uh, Dr. Bowman, and for Jack, both in Japan, uh, to give us real numbers?
[03:09:02.076 --> 03:09:03.437]  Uh, your take on that, Dr. Bowman.
[03:09:04.872 --> 03:09:08.357]  Well no, of course not.
[03:09:08.357 --> 03:09:15.768]  The only numbers that you can trust are the numbers that you get on your own.
[03:09:18.860 --> 03:09:35.392]  The government is passing on information that they get from Tepco, the utility company, who has been lying and obfuscating and avoiding things for years.
[03:09:35.392 --> 03:09:38.574]  We know that the Japanese were warned
[03:09:39.916 --> 03:09:58.778]  A couple of years ago at least that something like this could happen and you know they didn't do anything about it and so we can't trust the numbers just as we can't trust our government to do the right thing.
[03:09:58.778 --> 03:09:59.379]  Our government
[03:10:00.180 --> 03:10:11.613]  Keeps extending the life of Indian Point near New York City and Diablo Canyon and San Onofre in California on fault lines.
[03:10:15.658 --> 03:10:24.180]  A living guide for foreigners from the region of the area that our caller Gunema is calling us from.
[03:10:24.180 --> 03:10:25.760]  He said very nearby.
[03:10:25.760 --> 03:10:31.241]  Briefly again, Jack, tell us exactly where that's located near Fukushima and are you outdoors?
[03:10:31.241 --> 03:10:32.841]  You're not seeing people vomit.
[03:10:32.841 --> 03:10:39.523]  You're not seeing people with red faces as the caller who just left Japan says his friends nearby are experiencing.
[03:10:39.523 --> 03:10:40.583]  You're not seeing that.
[03:10:40.583 --> 03:10:41.403]  That's some good news.
[03:10:42.628 --> 03:10:45.530]  No, I'm not seeing anything like that at all.
[03:10:45.530 --> 03:10:55.256]  However, in Ibaraki Prefecture, which is just south of Fukushima, they do have severely elevated radiation levels.
[03:10:55.256 --> 03:11:02.040]  And my question to Dr. Goldman... Hold on, let me stop you there because you're there, sir, and then you can ask your question.
[03:11:02.040 --> 03:11:03.741]  What prefect is that?
[03:11:03.741 --> 03:11:08.344]  And obviously we can, because they're all listed in sequential order, we can just go to www.pref.gov.
[03:11:10.825 --> 03:11:11.265]  Right, exactly.
[03:11:11.265 --> 03:11:11.966]  Gunma.
[03:11:11.966 --> 03:11:15.587]  I'm sorry, it's Ibaragi.
[03:11:15.587 --> 03:11:19.309]  Which is the prefecture immediately south of Fukushima.
[03:11:35.365 --> 03:11:37.448]  Ibaragi.
[03:11:37.448 --> 03:11:41.352]  I-B-A-G-R-A-G-I.
[03:11:41.352 --> 03:11:43.535]  Say that again, please.
[03:11:43.535 --> 03:11:50.163]  That's I-A-B-A-G-A-R-I.
[03:11:50.163 --> 03:11:53.707]  I-A-B-A-G-R-I?
[03:11:53.707 --> 03:11:54.628]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:11:54.628 --> 03:11:55.109]  A-R-Y.
[03:11:57.119 --> 03:11:57.919]  A-R-I.
[03:11:57.919 --> 03:11:58.540]  A-R-I.
[03:11:58.540 --> 03:11:59.201]  Okay.
[03:11:59.201 --> 03:12:01.363]  We're going to put that in at the end of that.
[03:12:01.363 --> 03:12:07.008]  So, because the federal government's not giving us numbers, that's one of the places on our maps they're not giving us numbers.
[03:12:07.008 --> 03:12:08.670]  You're saying you're getting it from the state.
[03:12:08.670 --> 03:12:09.551]  What does it say there?
[03:12:09.551 --> 03:12:11.753]  This is breaking news.
[03:12:11.753 --> 03:12:17.478]  Basically, they've got really extremely elevated levels of radiation there.
[03:12:17.478 --> 03:12:19.160]  But they're not showing a graph?
[03:12:19.160 --> 03:12:20.101]  Because what's the graph say?
[03:12:21.260 --> 03:12:37.205]  Well, what I found on the map that I was able to find was that they had basically somewhere on the scale of maybe 150 times the normal, you know, one day's level of radiation that was coming in there.
[03:12:37.205 --> 03:12:40.166]  Alright, well this is something USA Today could do.
[03:12:40.166 --> 03:12:46.609]  They followed our lead saying they're not releasing the info on those two counties or regions, prefectories.
[03:12:46.609 --> 03:12:47.709]  How do you pronounce them properly?
[03:12:49.219 --> 03:12:51.002]  Uh, it's the Prefecture.
[03:12:51.002 --> 03:12:51.162]  Yes.
[03:13:01.482 --> 03:13:03.223]  Man, I should have been doing this myself for two days.
[03:13:03.223 --> 03:13:10.390]  I've been saying I need to go through these, and they come in, and I don't even sit there and do the basic journalism I deserve to be punched in the nose and drugged to the streets, ladies and gentlemen, not thanked.
[03:13:10.390 --> 03:13:11.831]  Stay there, Jack.
[03:13:11.831 --> 03:13:14.213]  Dr. Bowman, we're gonna go in there.
[03:13:14.213 --> 03:13:16.595]  I don't want people to flood the site and crash it now, folks.
[03:13:16.595 --> 03:13:17.936]  Wait till we get there.
[03:13:17.936 --> 03:13:24.942]  www.prefiabagari.gm.
[03:13:24.942 --> 03:13:26.063]  Hit it, hit it hard.
[03:13:26.063 --> 03:13:29.706]  Dr. Bowman, if this is confirmed 150 times levels, what does that mean?
[03:13:31.291 --> 03:13:37.293]  Well, that's sort of on the borderline where some people may start getting radiation sickness.
[03:13:37.293 --> 03:13:43.275]  By the way, that URL you gave out, I don't think was correct.
[03:13:43.275 --> 03:13:53.679]  First, after the P-R-E-F, you have to have a dot, and then, I'm not sure the name of that prefecture is spelled right, and then another dot, and then J-P for Japan.
[03:13:55.728 --> 03:13:59.151]  Well, we pulled it up with what he told us about the GM.
[03:13:59.151 --> 03:14:00.192]  And it came up?
[03:14:00.192 --> 03:14:01.293]  It's JP, I'm sorry.
[03:14:01.293 --> 03:14:02.974]  I'm out of it here, live on air.
[03:14:02.974 --> 03:14:04.796]  Okay, we're pulling it up right now.
[03:14:04.796 --> 03:14:08.118]  How would you spell it, Dr. Bowman?
[03:14:08.118 --> 03:14:14.364]  Uh... Uh, I'd be, uh...
[03:14:16.241 --> 03:14:19.745]  A-R-A-G-R-Y.
[03:14:19.745 --> 03:14:21.527]  I think something like that.
[03:14:21.527 --> 03:14:29.915]  I'm not sure, but... We need to just get a listing of the... Keep trying, but it is .jp at the end.
[03:14:29.915 --> 03:14:30.816]  Okay.
[03:14:30.816 --> 03:14:32.438]  Okay.
[03:14:32.438 --> 03:14:33.819]  Man, I tell you, we will...
[03:14:35.989 --> 03:14:38.330]  We will pull that prefect up right now.
[03:14:38.330 --> 03:14:39.031]  Jack, please.
[03:14:39.031 --> 03:14:40.752]  So you're on there.
[03:14:40.752 --> 03:14:45.855]  We pulled up what you said and it did show in your county that it's 10 times.
[03:14:45.855 --> 03:14:49.196]  You're saying you're looking at it and it's 150.
[03:14:49.196 --> 03:14:49.977]  Well, yeah.
[03:14:49.977 --> 03:14:58.021]  For Ibaraki Prefecture, it's severely elevated at this point.
[03:14:58.021 --> 03:15:00.963]  But that's not news being put out by the National Japanese News, correct?
[03:15:02.632 --> 03:15:09.557]  Um, no, not by the national Japanese news, but by the, um, the, the, how can I say the state level news?
[03:15:09.557 --> 03:15:14.941]  Um, they are definitely putting out, uh, you know, the information as they see it.
[03:15:14.941 --> 03:15:19.785]  And so there's definitely a move by the state governments to go ahead and put out the news.
[03:15:19.785 --> 03:15:24.769]  That's, you know, that's the best that they know, um, in order to protect the people.
[03:15:29.685 --> 03:15:33.608]  Okay, we're working on this right now and obviously I'll get Kurt Nemo and everybody else on it.
[03:15:33.608 --> 03:15:37.451]  So the local news is reporting that it's 150 times.
[03:15:37.451 --> 03:15:47.478]  Yeah, and I wouldn't be surprised if that figure has fluctuated considerably above that over the last few days.
[03:15:47.478 --> 03:15:50.160]  Because it goes in ebbs and flows.
[03:15:50.160 --> 03:15:55.984]  Yeah, with the wind and all the rest.
[03:15:55.984 --> 03:15:58.406]  Alright, Jack from Japan, anything else you'd like to add?
[03:15:59.690 --> 03:16:05.592]  Well, just basically, you know, the French, British, Australian, German, and U.S.
[03:16:05.592 --> 03:16:14.035]  governments have declared that anybody who wants to evacuate the country, you know, that they've got free air flights out of the country.
[03:16:14.035 --> 03:16:25.040]  And really, to be honest, I'm not really sure how certain I can be of the government at this point.
[03:16:26.693 --> 03:16:32.460]  You know the everybody is saying you know if you want to get on out of here you can.
[03:16:32.460 --> 03:16:41.850]  The Japanese government is telling us that if you're within 20 or I believe it's 30 kilometers of the event that just go ahead and shut your house up and
[03:16:42.911 --> 03:16:44.092]  From the front page.
[03:16:44.092 --> 03:16:44.713]  There's a red dot
[03:17:09.557 --> 03:17:13.620]  Okay, well, you're on a phone line that's in Minnesota.
[03:17:13.620 --> 03:17:16.042]  We're here in Texas.
[03:17:16.042 --> 03:17:19.385]  But no, it's fine.
[03:17:19.385 --> 03:17:20.686]  Do it live on air.
[03:17:20.686 --> 03:17:22.007]  It's fine.
[03:17:34.554 --> 03:17:44.236]  Alright well basically if you go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5 squares on the right hand side and then there's a thing you can click on there and then there's a
[03:17:57.145 --> 03:18:13.710]  Right, uh, on the right-hand side, on the lower right-hand side, there's a, uh, signal that you can click on that goes to, um, uh, where you can get information for the, you know, basically for the emergency, and, um, and click on that.
[03:18:13.710 --> 03:18:14.770]  Yeah, we're in that.
[03:18:14.770 --> 03:18:15.491]  It seems hidden.
[03:18:15.491 --> 03:18:18.071]  Continue.
[03:18:18.071 --> 03:18:20.372]  Ah, gosh.
[03:18:20.372 --> 03:18:21.993]  Can you email us the actual sub-URL?
[03:18:24.008 --> 03:18:25.869]  Only because we're running out of time in broadcast.
[03:18:25.869 --> 03:18:28.430]  I'd be calm and I meant to do this the last few days.
[03:18:28.430 --> 03:18:29.851]  I could literally kick myself.
[03:18:29.851 --> 03:18:31.952]  But where's the mainstream news?
[03:18:31.952 --> 03:18:41.157]  They just let the federal government of Japan give them no information so they say we don't know and now I'm here floundering around doing the job that the US military should be doing.
[03:18:41.157 --> 03:18:44.439]  Dr. Bowman, what's your take on this?
[03:18:44.439 --> 03:18:48.901]  Well, I'd say keep at it and dig for that information.
[03:18:48.901 --> 03:18:51.363]  I'm not
[03:18:52.495 --> 03:19:00.339]  You know, I think what you find will be better than what we've been getting from the federal government, but it still might not be everything.
[03:19:00.339 --> 03:19:03.701]  But keep at it.
[03:19:03.701 --> 03:19:11.945]  The bottom line, I think, is that the Japanese people are in enormous danger.
[03:19:17.556 --> 03:19:26.780]  I think if I was over there and I didn't have something I had to do or wasn't going to be useful in saving lives, I think I'd leave.
[03:19:26.780 --> 03:19:28.061]  Well, they've certainly been doing that.
[03:19:28.061 --> 03:19:33.723]  We're going to come back in the final segment with Dr. Bob Bowman, and I appreciate all of Jack's help.
[03:19:33.723 --> 03:19:35.824]  Stay with us, Jack, but I want to ask this question.
[03:19:36.849 --> 03:19:37.990]  To Dr. Bowman.
[03:19:37.990 --> 03:19:44.916]  We had Dr. Chris Busby, a chemical physicist on, who's an advisor to the BBC.
[03:19:44.916 --> 03:19:45.997]  He said this is a cover-up.
[03:19:45.997 --> 03:19:48.079]  Meltdown has probably already occurred.
[03:19:48.079 --> 03:19:53.043]  Bigger than Chernobyl, as you said, Doctor.
[03:19:53.043 --> 03:20:00.189]  And he went on to talk about the internalization of the radiation and how the nuclear industry spins that.
[03:20:00.189 --> 03:20:01.110]  I'm going to talk to you, Doctor.
[03:20:03.320 --> 03:20:10.366]  Alex has told you that the Mideast uprisings over food prices and shortages caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide.
[03:20:10.366 --> 03:20:13.028]  We're seeing the impact right here in the United States.
[03:20:13.028 --> 03:20:22.075]  Ethanol that was supposed to reduce petroleum use and fuel prices hit a 30-month high in February, and pump prices are expected to reach $5 a gallon.
[03:20:22.075 --> 03:20:28.640]  Because of shipping costs, food is being priced out of the reach of millions of Americans, with an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days.
[03:20:30.401 --> 03:20:30.601]  I think so.
[03:20:47.100 --> 03:20:49.101]  Take advantage of free shipping by calling 800-409-5633.
[03:20:49.101 --> 03:20:51.103]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[03:20:51.103 --> 03:20:52.583]  800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[03:20:52.583 --> 03:20:53.784]  America, you've been warned!
[03:21:11.169 --> 03:21:14.291]  I told you about the video that details this shocking prediction.
[03:21:14.291 --> 03:21:17.953]  So far, over 6 million people have watched this free video online.
[03:21:17.953 --> 03:21:18.774]  Have you?
[03:21:18.774 --> 03:21:22.356]  Again, this big event has nothing to do with war or the stock market.
[03:21:22.356 --> 03:21:24.858]  Yet it could change everything about your normal way of life.
[03:21:24.858 --> 03:21:30.081]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your family.
[03:21:30.081 --> 03:21:31.262]  Could this really happen?
[03:21:31.262 --> 03:21:35.265]  Well, the man who created this video has been right about many predictions in his career.
[03:21:35.265 --> 03:21:37.126]  He was among the first to predict the collapse of GM.
[03:21:42.814 --> 03:21:43.254]  We're good.
[03:22:02.383 --> 03:22:03.403]  Gold isn't for you?
[03:22:03.403 --> 03:22:08.944]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[03:22:08.944 --> 03:22:09.484]  I get it.
[03:22:09.484 --> 03:22:19.106]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[03:22:19.106 --> 03:22:20.507]  That's not what's happening.
[03:22:20.507 --> 03:22:28.988]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[03:22:28.988 --> 03:22:32.229]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[03:22:32.369 --> 03:22:36.631]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[03:22:36.631 --> 03:22:38.231]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[03:22:38.231 --> 03:22:42.193]  dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[03:22:42.193 --> 03:22:46.014]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[03:22:46.014 --> 03:22:46.914]  You should too.
[03:22:46.914 --> 03:22:48.055]  Find out what they know.
[03:22:48.055 --> 03:22:51.376]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[03:22:51.376 --> 03:22:51.436]  800-686-2237.
[03:22:51.436 --> 03:22:51.776]  800-686-2237.
[03:22:51.776 --> 03:22:51.956]  That's 800-686-2237.
[03:23:01.718 --> 03:23:04.740]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[03:23:04.740 --> 03:23:15.345]  Did you know that the United Nations is a Trojan horse and that the Secretary General of the United Nations has always been a socialist from the day that it was founded?
[03:23:15.345 --> 03:23:19.527]  Therefore, it can only bring about a one-world communist government.
[03:23:19.527 --> 03:23:23.449]  Do you realize that they will be in charge of all weaponry,
[03:23:23.877 --> 03:23:34.199]  If the United States and every other nation turns over to it, any nation that rebels, they will just send a nuclear weapon to bring it into subjection.
[03:23:34.199 --> 03:23:44.241]  We'd like to help you understand how these world events are going to affect you in the near future by offering you a one-year free subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[03:23:44.241 --> 03:23:45.742]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800.
[03:23:47.585 --> 03:23:47.645]  516-8736.
[03:23:47.645 --> 03:23:48.466]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[03:23:48.466 --> 03:23:50.727]  Call now while operators are standing by.
[03:24:06.360 --> 03:24:08.901]  All right, Dr. Bob Bowman is our guest.
[03:24:08.901 --> 03:24:14.103]  We'll obviously be back live tomorrow, 11 to 2, probably going into overdrive back Sunday.
[03:24:14.103 --> 03:24:16.684]  If this continues to unfold, we'll have to be live Saturday.
[03:24:16.684 --> 03:24:20.406]  Just watch InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com for announcements.
[03:24:20.406 --> 03:24:22.447]  Don't forget Dr. Bob Bowman's excellent website, the...
[03:24:23.467 --> 03:24:31.193]  Patriots.us and we'll continue to have Dr. Bob Bowman and other physicists, nuclear physicists, on the broadcast.
[03:24:31.193 --> 03:24:35.176]  The retransmission's coming up in a moment with Dr. Chris Busby.
[03:24:35.176 --> 03:24:37.458]  Incredible hour, very informative.
[03:24:37.458 --> 03:24:41.341]  We did with him and all the latest will be covered after the break, but Dr. Bob Bowman.
[03:24:42.697 --> 03:25:05.355]  Looking at this and what's coming towards the West and the level of the cover-up, can you describe to people what Dr. Doug Rockey's talked about, Dr. Chris Busby's talked about, both physicists, that the nuclear industry has a false gauge saying, well, it's 2, it's 10, it's 20 times, you know, safe levels that might hit the U.S., but that's no big deal.
[03:25:05.355 --> 03:25:06.536]  It's like sunshine.
[03:25:06.536 --> 03:25:11.500]  Well, no, you're ingesting these particles and these doctors were saying that's what's so devastating.
[03:25:11.500 --> 03:25:12.101]  Is that correct?
[03:25:13.752 --> 03:25:23.258]  Yeah, it's if you ingest the particle, if you breathe it in, that is what is difficult and dangerous.
[03:25:23.258 --> 03:25:28.161]  Now, most of the radiation, of course, will fall on the ocean.
[03:25:28.161 --> 03:25:35.726]  Some will fall on the land, might possibly get into the food chain.
[03:25:35.726 --> 03:25:42.691]  Breathing it in is sort of hard to do when there's so little of it falling out.
[03:25:43.789 --> 03:25:49.852]  And, uh, how much has gotten into the jet stream now?
[03:25:49.852 --> 03:25:51.673]  Probably not much.
[03:25:51.673 --> 03:25:54.534]  The explosions have not gone very high.
[03:25:54.534 --> 03:25:57.195]  They've gone a few thousand feet.
[03:25:57.195 --> 03:26:03.518]  You have to send that stuff up to 30-35,000 feet before it gets caught in the jet stream.
[03:26:03.518 --> 03:26:10.522]  So, um, yeah, if you're concerned, wear a mask.
[03:26:10.522 --> 03:26:12.383]  Just one of these paper masks.
[03:26:13.671 --> 03:26:17.294]  Uh, that will make a huge difference.
[03:26:17.294 --> 03:26:26.862]  And then also, if anybody could get potassium iodate, consult your doctor of course, but once, once radiation levels did go up, it would be advisable to take that, correct doctor?
[03:26:28.738 --> 03:26:41.848]  Once the radiation levels are up, you know, a couple hundred times normal or more than that, or there's any indication of radiation sickness, that's the time to take it.
[03:26:41.848 --> 03:26:46.091]  All right, Dr. Bob Bowman, we will talk to you again in the very near future.
[03:26:46.091 --> 03:26:47.812]  Thank you for spending so much time with us.
[03:26:47.812 --> 03:26:48.473]  We're very thankful.
[03:26:49.423 --> 03:26:53.965]  Okay, maybe next time we can talk about other stuff like the wars of 9-11 and all the rest of it.
[03:26:53.965 --> 03:26:56.306]  Yes, sir, we do cover all of that here, as you know.
[03:26:56.306 --> 03:26:58.047]  Yeah, you bet.
[03:26:58.047 --> 03:27:00.448]  Absolutely, and hopefully you'll be coming to Austin in April.
[03:27:00.448 --> 03:27:01.289]  We'll have you in studio.
[03:27:01.289 --> 03:27:02.469]  Take care, my friend.
[03:27:02.469 --> 03:27:03.670]  Great, bye-bye.
[03:27:03.670 --> 03:27:06.972]  We've got some other shocking news here.
[03:27:06.972 --> 03:27:10.013]  This being reported out of Fox Television in D.C.
[03:27:10.013 --> 03:27:12.274]  Windows at Washington, D.C.
[03:27:12.274 --> 03:27:13.815]  Republican office shot out.
[03:27:15.060 --> 03:27:20.623]  There have been a lot of death threats by the union-connected people against Republicans as of late.
[03:27:20.623 --> 03:27:27.846]  MSNBC has been hailing all of the vitriol, but when the Tea Party people just protest, they call it violent and dangerous.
[03:27:27.846 --> 03:27:32.649]  Police are searching for suspects that someone shot out windows at a Republican office in the district.
[03:27:32.649 --> 03:27:35.110]  Police say the vandalism occurred Tuesday night.
[03:27:35.110 --> 03:27:37.011]  All the windows of the office were damaged.
[03:27:37.011 --> 03:27:43.054]  The executive director of the Republican committee says an air gun was probably used, so that's good news that it was just a BB gun.
[03:27:43.054 --> 03:27:44.755]  Could have just been vandalism or could have been a dumb
[03:27:44.955 --> 03:27:45.616]  I think?
[03:28:10.509 --> 03:28:10.709]  Yeah.
[03:28:26.579 --> 03:28:26.939]  I don't
[03:28:51.081 --> 03:28:59.110]  But my wife's not sure, so we've been tearing things apart and found it right under our nose with folks we interviewed 11, 12 years ago dealing with it.
[03:28:59.110 --> 03:29:00.532]  And I'm probably going to get them on air.
[03:29:00.532 --> 03:29:02.394]  They're folks that also build nuclear detectors.
[03:29:04.454 --> 03:29:09.658]  Raymond Teague's friends with him and worked with him in the past, tried to get me into it 10-12 years ago about how dangerous reactors were.
[03:29:09.658 --> 03:29:15.422]  But the point is, is that we've got to have all the inserts and the facts and you've got to get your medical advice first.
[03:29:15.422 --> 03:29:18.904]  We're not doing that, but it's something legally sold all over the country, but it's gone.
[03:29:18.904 --> 03:29:23.347]  And so look for that at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:29:23.347 --> 03:29:30.532]  We also have the Dulse and seaweed-based iodine pills available at InfoWarsTeam.com.
[03:29:30.532 --> 03:29:32.754]  But again, that's just for regular health, folks.
[03:29:34.776 --> 03:29:39.740]  And the whole point is with this iodine stuff is you don't take it till the radiation's here and you know it's going on.
[03:29:39.740 --> 03:29:41.002]  According to Dr. Bob Bowman.
[03:29:41.002 --> 03:29:43.084]  He's a doctor and physicist, so I'll listen to him.
[03:29:43.084 --> 03:29:45.246]  But you take your own advice, your own research.
[03:29:45.246 --> 03:29:47.288]  Key retransmission coming up now.
[03:29:47.288 --> 03:29:49.750]  Infowars.com and on the radio stations.
[03:29:49.750 --> 03:29:50.891]  And then Dr. Chris Busby.
[03:29:50.891 --> 03:29:51.672]  Key info coming up.
