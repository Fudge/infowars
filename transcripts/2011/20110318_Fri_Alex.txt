[00:00:05.305 --> 00:00:09.488]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.949]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:12.651]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.271 --> 00:00:16.894]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.454 --> 00:00:21.578]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.945]  Well, we have a very important Live Friday broadcast lined up for you here today.
[00:00:32.401 --> 00:00:42.426]  We have Dr. Nick Begich joining us to break down what's happening with the ongoing Chernobyl-like events in the Fukushima region of Japan.
[00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:52.471]  The Associated Press is reporting that radiation has now reached the West Coast, where meteorologists predicted it would make landfall in Los Angeles.
[00:00:53.311 --> 00:01:00.634]  They're whitewashing it, saying that it's minuscule and culture is actually in the news, saying that radiation is actually healthy and good for you.
[00:01:00.734 --> 00:01:03.655]  You cannot make this magnitude of evil up.
[00:01:04.535 --> 00:01:10.378]  We also have the Wall Street Journal reporting low levels of radioactive material begin to be detected across the Pacific.
[00:01:10.618 --> 00:01:12.899]  That's when you hold a Geiger counter up to the general air.
[00:01:14.332 --> 00:01:20.555]  And it shows a slight increase, but that's because it's picking up from a distance the particles floating by.
[00:01:20.895 --> 00:01:24.277]  It's if you ingest those, you breathe those.
[00:01:24.717 --> 00:01:30.240]  That's what the physicist after physicist after nuclear physicist has explained.
[00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.003]  Dr. Doug Rockey, Dr. Bob Bowman, Dr. Busby yesterday,
[00:01:35.643 --> 00:01:42.386]  That's the issue, and that's how they cover this up and tell the troops that DU is not bad for them.
[00:01:42.426 --> 00:01:52.390]  And we know there's four-time birth defects in the children of troops exposed to DU, 12 to 15-time increase in birth defects and cancers in the Fallujah area that was heavily bombarded by it.
[00:01:52.691 --> 00:01:55.052]  That's the British Medical Journal that did that study.
[00:01:55.992 --> 00:01:57.713]  Obviously, we're going to be talking about Libya.
[00:01:58.293 --> 00:02:00.254]  As soon as the globalist-backed rebels
[00:02:01.647 --> 00:02:02.928]  And I don't have a dog in this fight.
[00:02:03.388 --> 00:02:04.669]  I don't like Muammar Gaddafi.
[00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:09.071]  The guy just reeks of tyranny and corruption and patheticness.
[00:02:10.251 --> 00:02:12.553]  But he's the old-fashioned king rat.
[00:02:12.973 --> 00:02:15.414]  He's the old-fashioned dictator.
[00:02:16.795 --> 00:02:20.997]  And doesn't allow abortions, doesn't allow infanticide, doesn't allow the U.N.
[00:02:21.037 --> 00:02:21.717]  inoculations.
[00:02:21.757 --> 00:02:23.898]  He caught them six years ago injecting them with HIV.
[00:02:23.918 --> 00:02:24.739]  That's mainstream news.
[00:02:25.714 --> 00:02:32.060]  And so the globalists want him out of there, and they actually want to put Al-Qaeda, Muslim extremists, Saudi-backed, Saudis are shipping weapons in.
[00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.182]  Al-Qaeda works for the New World Order.
[00:02:35.603 --> 00:02:37.044]  It's a creation of the Pentagon.
[00:02:37.464 --> 00:02:40.026]  And when the public finally figures that out, they'll understand everything.
[00:02:40.647 --> 00:02:43.590]  Took out the secular Saddam, put the Muslim extremists in in Iraq.
[00:02:44.485 --> 00:02:50.490]  Taking out Hussein Mubarak, now putting the Muslim Brotherhood in with ElBaradei at the head of it in Egypt.
[00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:58.556]  This is a destabilization program that we reported five months ago with inside sources via Lindsey Williams.
[00:02:58.596 --> 00:03:00.538]  And you can't, no brag, just fact.
[00:03:00.558 --> 00:03:01.598]  You can't argue with the facts.
[00:03:01.658 --> 00:03:13.708]  So, we have seen the incredibly, incredibly extreme Orwellian behavior going on
[00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:23.723]  With the UN voting 10-0, with five abstentions, yesterday to attack Libya.
[00:03:23.843 --> 00:03:30.567]  And they call it a no-fly zone, but then in the letter it says bombardment, and they've announced British, French, NATO, U.S.
[00:03:30.587 --> 00:03:36.930]  cruise missile ships, missile cruisers, preparing to bombard his, quote, emplacements, his military bases.
[00:03:39.008 --> 00:03:41.831]  And she said he may have targeted civilians.
[00:03:41.871 --> 00:03:45.655]  Well, these are rebels who are civilians, who are U.S.-backed.
[00:03:46.095 --> 00:03:48.558]  They caught MI6, British SAS there.
[00:03:48.838 --> 00:03:51.801]  They admit they're pouring weapons in out of globalist-controlled Egypt.
[00:03:52.942 --> 00:03:58.888]  And it's a little dictator fighting against the globalist takeover of Libya.
[00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.041]  And it's pure hypocrisy.
[00:04:02.341 --> 00:04:03.501]  A thousand plus drones.
[00:04:03.541 --> 00:04:05.502]  They say they kill no-name terrorists.
[00:04:06.262 --> 00:04:10.003]  They say that they will kill 200 people to kill one bad guy.
[00:04:10.343 --> 00:04:12.664]  Or they'll kill anybody in Afghanistan with a gun in their hand.
[00:04:13.144 --> 00:04:14.904]  When it's like East Texas, everybody's got a gun.
[00:04:15.285 --> 00:04:17.845]  And that's like, oh, collateral damage, no big deal, fighting Al-Qaeda.
[00:04:18.165 --> 00:04:21.046]  But oh my gosh, Qaddafi may have striped innocent crowds.
[00:04:21.266 --> 00:04:22.287]  Turns out that was a lie.
[00:04:22.527 --> 00:04:24.347]  Turns out he never ran to Venezuela.
[00:04:24.747 --> 00:04:26.548]  These are all lies is the point.
[00:04:27.228 --> 00:04:28.628]  And it's incredibly hypocritical.
[00:04:28.668 --> 00:04:33.810]  The globalists will bombard Iraq, Afghanistan with DU, just absolute nuclear warfare.
[00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.231]  And it's loving and good, and our troops dying is loving and good from it.
[00:04:37.551 --> 00:04:40.932]  But then, he, he may have fired and strafed a crowd and killed five people.
[00:04:41.152 --> 00:04:41.872]  That's horrible!
[00:04:42.032 --> 00:04:42.732]  Can't believe it!
[00:04:42.852 --> 00:04:43.673]  We gotta do something!
[00:04:43.793 --> 00:04:44.853]  We're so humanitarian!
[00:04:45.053 --> 00:04:46.473]  The left is like, war!
[00:04:46.713 --> 00:04:47.014]  War!
[00:04:47.074 --> 00:04:47.834]  We're liberal!
[00:04:48.034 --> 00:04:48.914]  It's humanitarian!
[00:04:48.974 --> 00:04:49.734]  Murder!
[00:04:50.174 --> 00:04:51.875]  The right wing's like, yes, murder!
[00:04:53.032 --> 00:04:58.948]  Well, the same bankers running this op are stealing your pension funds and getting the Pentagon ready to take your property and knock your teeth out.
[00:04:59.188 --> 00:05:00.592]  They hate you as much as they hate the Libyans.
[00:05:01.832 --> 00:05:08.535]  Alex has told you that the Mideast uprisings over food prices and shortages caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide.
[00:05:08.875 --> 00:05:11.116]  We're seeing the impact right here in the United States.
[00:05:11.556 --> 00:05:16.919]  Ethanol, that was supposed to reduce petroleum use and fuel prices, hit a 30-month high in February.
[00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:20.340]  And pump prices are expected to reach $5 a gallon.
[00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:28.484]  Because of shipping costs, food is being priced out of the reach of millions of Americans, with an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days.
[00:05:28.844 --> 00:05:30.665]  Move quickly while you can still afford it.
[00:05:30.865 --> 00:05:31.365]  We're good.
[00:06:00.305 --> 00:06:01.445]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:06:01.485 --> 00:06:08.148]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:06:08.408 --> 00:06:10.689]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:16.151]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:06:16.351 --> 00:06:19.112]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:06:19.392 --> 00:06:21.453]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:06:21.693 --> 00:06:27.637]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:31.140]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:36.864]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:06:37.104 --> 00:06:38.425]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:06:38.745 --> 00:06:39.906]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:06:40.046 --> 00:06:42.588]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:06:42.728 --> 00:06:46.771]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:06:46.951 --> 00:06:48.973]  You can find the video at www.
[00:06:49.733 --> 00:06:51.437]  End of America 3.com.
[00:06:51.557 --> 00:06:54.023]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[00:07:01.872 --> 00:07:05.493]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:05.833 --> 00:07:13.954]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:07:14.694 --> 00:07:18.735]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:07:19.315 --> 00:07:30.137]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:07:30.777 --> 00:07:39.780]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:45.322]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:07:45.722 --> 00:07:52.885]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:53.205 --> 00:07:55.606]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:08:05.455 --> 00:08:09.657]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:08:10.297 --> 00:08:11.098]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.878 --> 00:08:13.799]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.819 --> 00:08:17.101]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.621 --> 00:08:21.683]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:22.663 --> 00:08:24.846]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[00:08:24.866 --> 00:08:27.450]  It is the 18th day of March, Friday, 2011.
[00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:32.557]  You're trying to visit InfoWars.com the last few days.
[00:08:32.637 --> 00:08:36.402]  We're getting record traffic on top of previous records.
[00:08:37.483 --> 00:08:41.446]  Literally millions of people now visiting the sites per day, not per week.
[00:08:42.006 --> 00:08:45.149]  InfoWars.com is basically down, off and on.
[00:08:45.569 --> 00:08:50.753]  PrisonPlanet.com is the auxiliary attack cruiser in the InfoWar.
[00:08:50.873 --> 00:08:52.554]  It is there and it is up.
[00:08:53.395 --> 00:08:56.638]  We are trying to work around all of this, but...
[00:08:57.418 --> 00:08:59.079]  We have big interactive websites.
[00:08:59.699 --> 00:09:04.621]  I get emails and get calls and people say, sometimes the comments don't work for hours.
[00:09:05.001 --> 00:09:10.283]  Yeah, and in emergencies we have to turn the comments off and sometimes that allows the site to go back up.
[00:09:10.564 --> 00:09:13.625]  It's not a conspiracy that sometimes comments are turned off.
[00:09:14.045 --> 00:09:19.267]  The comments have been turned off off and on the last week because I make the executive decision.
[00:09:19.307 --> 00:09:21.368]  They go, well, we can't keep it up if the comments are on.
[00:09:21.648 --> 00:09:22.729]  Turn them off.
[00:09:23.069 --> 00:09:23.369]  In fact,
[00:09:23.649 --> 00:09:24.469]  Turn them both off!
[00:09:24.529 --> 00:09:26.630]  Turn them off on InfoWars and Prison Planet for now.
[00:09:26.931 --> 00:09:43.018]  It's key to get the sights up with the news about the radiation reaching the United States, with the attack on Libya in the offing right now, with all of the other insane economic news that we have here in front of us today.
[00:09:43.719 --> 00:09:45.440]  Continuing here,
[00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:49.222]  Ladies and gentlemen, with some other huge news we're going to be going over.
[00:09:49.682 --> 00:09:59.250]  After we cover the radiation, after we cover the latest developments, where the mainstream news is now saying it may just completely go Chernobyl, and they may give up all hope.
[00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:00.591]  We hope that that's not the case.
[00:10:01.471 --> 00:10:05.434]  We've also got the situation in Tripoli, Benghazi, there in Libya.
[00:10:05.894 --> 00:10:06.935]  Huge developments there.
[00:10:06.955 --> 00:10:08.336]  They now call no-fly zones.
[00:10:08.897 --> 00:10:12.119]  It means full-out bombardment and war in your face.
[00:10:12.179 --> 00:10:13.320]  It's humanitarian.
[00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:14.241]  Yes, of course it is.
[00:10:15.101 --> 00:10:19.204]  Continuing, New York Fed confirms intervention in currency markets.
[00:10:19.524 --> 00:10:23.046]  This has been a secret for decades with their manipulation.
[00:10:23.747 --> 00:10:24.808]  Now mainstream news.
[00:10:24.948 --> 00:10:27.389]  Also London Telegraph freaking out.
[00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:28.130]  U.S.
[00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:39.718]  Treasury Tim Geithner shot global markets by revealing that Washington is quite open to Chinese proposals for the gradual development of a global reserve currency run by the International Monetary Fund.
[00:10:39.738 --> 00:10:41.119]  That was out two years ago.
[00:10:41.439 --> 00:10:44.501]  There's fresh reports out today.
[00:10:44.821 --> 00:10:44.905]  Yeah.
[00:10:45.612 --> 00:10:45.972]  I think?
[00:11:16.253 --> 00:11:22.177]  Off and on doing NCAA picks, visiting with hockey teams and professional basketball teams.
[00:11:22.577 --> 00:11:25.920]  He finally made a brief statement about how the U.S.
[00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:28.642]  wants to help Japan, even though the U.S.
[00:11:28.662 --> 00:11:33.765]  troops have been pulled out and the fleet's been sent away because of the radiation going out to sea towards the West Coast.
[00:11:34.246 --> 00:11:37.208]  He gave a brief statement finally last night, six days in.
[00:11:37.548 --> 00:11:39.029]  We're now seven days in.
[00:11:39.089 --> 00:11:39.730]  Now remember,
[00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:47.499]  The low-level radiation, if you believe the UN and the Associated Press, that's where they're getting their information, UN detectors.
[00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:50.143]  We're not getting that from the US government on the West Coast.
[00:11:50.644 --> 00:11:51.785]  But UN detectors...
[00:11:52.910 --> 00:12:20.629]  are reporting uh... low levels of radiation what they call minuscule fallout now remember as we've been saying for now seven days when the radiation gets here it's only from the first week on friday takes on average seven days across the pacific on average and has reached with a prediction of seven days a meteorologist predicted last saturday and uh... we of course put out one of the first big reports on that picked up a drug report on saturday and sunday
[00:12:21.949 --> 00:12:30.457]  So, the lower-level leaks from the initial tsunami and earthquake and some of the off-gassing, that's what's now first reaching the United States.
[00:12:30.497 --> 00:12:37.243]  Then you have the explosion on Saturday at Fukushima 1, the devastating mega-explosion at Fukushima 3, Mark 1 MOX reactor.
[00:12:38.166 --> 00:12:55.880]  on monday other reactors tuesday wednesday thursday blowing up and and and setting on fire and off gassing uh... so we have all of that uh... unfolding right now we have all of that unfolding and that radiation then is set to intensify
[00:12:56.721 --> 00:13:02.306]  Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, right through to next week.
[00:13:02.366 --> 00:13:08.711]  And we need independent universities, independent organizations, independent individuals to be testing for that radiation.
[00:13:08.751 --> 00:13:16.276]  And remember, as Dr. Bob Bowman said, as Dr. Busby said, and as Dr. Rockey has said in previous interviews,
[00:13:17.157 --> 00:13:21.280]  Even a doubling of radiation that they say is safe, or a tripling, or a quadrupling.
[00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.662]  They're claiming ten times the radiation is safe.
[00:13:24.062 --> 00:13:32.128]  Remember, that's background radiation, not actual particles that are getting up near the Geiger counter that randomly come in and that you breathe.
[00:13:32.628 --> 00:13:36.693]  That's the big killer, but it takes years, if not decades, to kill you.
[00:13:36.713 --> 00:13:47.287]  In fact, here's new scientist from all the way back in 2002 headline, nuclear test fallout killed thousands in the United States.
[00:13:47.848 --> 00:13:59.479]  Nuclear test fallout killed thousands in the United States, and it goes over the number of cancers and deaths directly connected to the cancers.
[00:13:59.599 --> 00:14:12.872]  Now, the UN, the New York Times, and the Atomic Energy Agency estimate 1 million have died in 25 years in cancers, leukemias, and other illnesses directly connected to the Chernobyl event.
[00:14:13.213 --> 00:14:17.043]  Which right now looks like it's smaller than what we've seen unfold.
[00:14:17.344 --> 00:14:20.773]  So you cannot trust the system with their history of making up...
[00:14:22.417 --> 00:14:25.840]  uh... information about fallout whitewashing it to tell you the truth.
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:32.605]  In fact, Ann Coulter is now in human events today with a devastatingly discrediting statement.
[00:14:32.965 --> 00:14:39.470]  A glowing report on radiation, Ann Coulter, with a terrible earthquake and the resulting tsunami that have devastated Japan.
[00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:47.696]  The only good news is that anyone exposed to excess radiation from the nuclear power plant is now probably much less likely to get cancer.
[00:14:48.621 --> 00:14:52.043]  And then she goes on with just bizarre statements.
[00:14:53.164 --> 00:15:08.714]  So now plutonium, uranium, strontium, tritium, cesium, and radioactive iodine, all in thousands of studies to absolutely confirm massive increases in cancer when you're exposed to even moderate levels.
[00:15:09.415 --> 00:15:10.896]  She is telling you it's good for you.
[00:15:11.536 --> 00:15:12.237]  I could play.
[00:15:14.147 --> 00:15:16.431]  CBS News, I've played it hundreds of times.
[00:15:17.213 --> 00:15:18.034]  In fact, let's cue it up.
[00:15:18.903 --> 00:15:20.763]  Mercury is good for you.
[00:15:20.864 --> 00:15:22.324]  It's good for children's behavior.
[00:15:22.684 --> 00:15:29.266]  But that's a lawyer talk, because they want you servile, brain-damaged, not thinking, and so they see that as good behavior.
[00:15:29.706 --> 00:15:34.267]  So in their weird world, it does improve cognitive brain function by lowering IQs.
[00:15:35.007 --> 00:15:37.367]  We've spent decades exposing sodium fluoride.
[00:15:37.407 --> 00:15:39.528]  Seven-fold increase in men and bone cancer.
[00:15:39.908 --> 00:15:41.248]  Three-fold increase in women.
[00:15:41.829 --> 00:15:42.989]  It hits men a lot worse.
[00:15:43.249 --> 00:15:45.209]  Women physiologically are tougher.
[00:15:45.249 --> 00:15:46.170]  Any doctor will tell you that.
[00:15:48.058 --> 00:15:49.679]  It really hits boys even worse.
[00:15:49.799 --> 00:15:52.181]  Generally averaging boys and men together at seven times.
[00:15:52.542 --> 00:15:56.064]  It's more than 14 times 12 and under boys.
[00:15:56.485 --> 00:15:57.245]  Devastating!
[00:15:57.566 --> 00:16:00.968]  You go to the store, it's baby water with fluoride for your baby.
[00:16:01.709 --> 00:16:03.610]  Their blood-brain barrier isn't developed properly.
[00:16:03.911 --> 00:16:05.052]  Goes directly into the brain.
[00:16:05.452 --> 00:16:09.375]  Now the EPA and FDA have recommended it not be used as pesticide anymore.
[00:16:09.675 --> 00:16:11.257]  It's bioaccumulating in the crops.
[00:16:12.264 --> 00:16:20.186]  Now they've recommended it be cut from 1.2 part per million to half, or 0.7 part per million.
[00:16:20.526 --> 00:16:23.066]  You see, we're winning the fight.
[00:16:23.566 --> 00:16:25.027]  Sodium fluoride's poison.
[00:16:26.127 --> 00:16:27.187]  Mercury's poison.
[00:16:27.907 --> 00:16:28.888]  Lead is poison.
[00:16:29.048 --> 00:16:31.868]  Asbestos is poisonous and carcinogenic.
[00:16:32.628 --> 00:16:35.109]  Remember they said the air is safe to breathe.
[00:16:36.411 --> 00:16:41.732]  And the CDC has now had to admit the Mayo Clinic has come out.
[00:16:41.792 --> 00:16:49.834]  They've done chest scans of the victims of 9-11, the asbestos, and all the rest of the toxins.
[00:16:50.795 --> 00:16:52.755]  Massive increases in cancer.
[00:16:52.935 --> 00:16:54.736]  Massive increases in death rates.
[00:16:55.156 --> 00:16:55.976]  That is confirmed.
[00:16:56.016 --> 00:17:01.117]  And then it came out years later that Christina Todd Whitman went to Bush and said, we've got to keep us evacuated for weeks.
[00:17:01.417 --> 00:17:01.958]  It's deadly.
[00:17:02.078 --> 00:17:03.158]  Our detectors, it's deadly.
[00:17:04.757 --> 00:17:07.159]  And they were told, no, say it's safe to breathe.
[00:17:07.759 --> 00:17:08.880]  No masks are needed.
[00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:13.424]  Because if they admit you need a mask, they've got to admit it's not safe for people in the area.
[00:17:14.244 --> 00:17:20.309]  So that's why Obama came out in the news today in an unbelievable statement.
[00:17:20.349 --> 00:17:24.473]  And I have the headline here, it's on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:17:25.554 --> 00:17:28.936]  An unbelievable statement.
[00:17:29.997 --> 00:17:31.959]  An off-the-charts statement.
[00:17:33.408 --> 00:17:37.391]  Saying that there's no need to prepare for nuclear fallout.
[00:17:37.712 --> 00:17:39.073]  Here are some of those headlines.
[00:17:39.533 --> 00:17:43.776]  AP, source, minuscule fallout reaches US, Southern California.
[00:17:44.317 --> 00:17:49.181]  Wall Street Journal, low levels of radioactive material begin to be detected across Pacific, including Hawaii.
[00:17:49.761 --> 00:17:55.686]  Airlines are coming in with radiation on board from Japan.
[00:17:56.086 --> 00:17:58.948]  Chernobyl situation may be last resort for Japan.
[00:17:59.389 --> 00:18:00.570]  Reactors, Reuters.
[00:18:03.078 --> 00:18:07.859]  Reduced pressure at Fukushima reactor indicates possible leakage from contained core.
[00:18:09.599 --> 00:18:11.040]  Mike Adams, Natural News.
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:14.160]  Obama tells Americans do not prepare for radioactive fallout.
[00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:21.282]  Just listen to your government as he prepares to leave the United States on a week-long trip.
[00:18:21.782 --> 00:18:23.242]  Right as the radiation goes past.
[00:18:23.682 --> 00:18:25.083]  Isn't that just convenient?
[00:18:25.503 --> 00:18:26.403]  Isn't that special?
[00:18:27.023 --> 00:18:28.543]  He's giving one speech while he's there.
[00:18:28.583 --> 00:18:30.784]  The rest of it is a vacation.
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:37.703]  Is a vacation for him after a week of NCAA babbling.
[00:18:39.164 --> 00:18:42.746]  Swedish government, radiation to cover entire northern hemisphere.
[00:18:43.146 --> 00:18:44.126]  Everyone to be affected.
[00:18:44.166 --> 00:18:45.747]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:18:46.207 --> 00:18:47.208]  Canada cover-up.
[00:18:47.868 --> 00:18:50.130]  Radioactive leak into Lake Ontario.
[00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:51.450]  High levels of radiation.
[00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:53.711]  They say don't worry, it's not bad for you.
[00:18:53.932 --> 00:18:55.212]  Coulter says it's good for you.
[00:18:55.753 --> 00:18:58.814]  Japan nuclear disaster caps decades of fake reports.
[00:18:59.214 --> 00:19:00.735]  Bloomberg reporting on the cover-ups.
[00:19:00.995 --> 00:19:01.456]  Ongoing.
[00:19:02.796 --> 00:19:08.880]  Even though I hate Michael Bloomberg, he's a gun-grabbing globalist, his publications are among the best and most accurate.
[00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:11.582]  I guess because top business people demand real info.
[00:19:11.862 --> 00:19:13.703]  They just know the average slaves aren't reading it.
[00:19:14.884 --> 00:19:21.128]  Continuing, Japan radiation fears spark panic, salt buying in China, believing the iodine will protect them.
[00:19:21.448 --> 00:19:30.274]  And to a certain extent from the pharmacists and doctors we've talked to, they say it helps a little, but it doesn't fully protect the thyroid from the radiation.
[00:19:31.007 --> 00:19:31.607]  It helps a little.
[00:19:32.608 --> 00:19:34.308]  So, that's going crazy there.
[00:19:34.749 --> 00:19:41.391]  Morton Salt has recently taken potassium iodine out of their salt.
[00:19:43.632 --> 00:19:46.614]  Japan passengers' cargo screened for radiation, AP.
[00:19:46.874 --> 00:19:55.097]  But when they come into Dallas, Chicago, San Francisco, and they pick up radiation with their luggage, they don't take it away from them, which they should and get rid of it.
[00:19:55.337 --> 00:19:57.678]  They say, go on, take it on out to your kids at home.
[00:19:57.918 --> 00:19:58.419]  We'll be back.
[00:19:58.459 --> 00:19:59.259]  Stay with us with Libya.
[00:20:00.734 --> 00:20:23.741]  Due to the extreme conditions from the Japanese earthquake and the fallout of depleted uranium, HempUSA.org recommends new important products that are loaded with iodine, micro plant powder, green life kelp powder, raw unprocessed red palm oil, and our 10% roll-on clear iodine that heals the skin and naturally puts iodine back into your entire body.

[00:20:30.083 --> 00:20:39.369]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:20:39.409 --> 00:20:40.150]  This capitalism?
[00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:46.354]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:20:46.494 --> 00:20:47.254]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:20:47.295 --> 00:20:50.377]  I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[00:20:50.437 --> 00:20:51.337]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.

[00:22:01.323 --> 00:22:04.947]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:22:05.347 --> 00:22:08.351]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:22:08.571 --> 00:22:13.356]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:22:13.376 --> 00:22:19.643]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:22:19.783 --> 00:22:22.026]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:22:22.546 --> 00:22:22.826]  Tim Geithner?
[00:22:22.846 --> 00:22:23.066]  Bernanke?
[00:22:23.086 --> 00:22:23.647]  They're arsonists!
[00:22:23.667 --> 00:22:24.447]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:22:24.467 --> 00:22:25.748]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:22:41.437 --> 00:22:43.278]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:22:43.558 --> 00:22:48.321]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:22:48.721 --> 00:22:58.647]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:22:59.547 --> 00:23:05.951]  Dr. David Barry has provided excellent advice for all those interested in practical economics and sound money.
[00:23:06.391 --> 00:23:07.692]  It's certainly worth reading.
[00:23:07.992 --> 00:23:15.874]  That's what Congressman Ron Paul said about Cha-Ching Wisdom, 123 Practical Universal Truths About Money, the new book by Dr. David Barry.
[00:23:16.074 --> 00:23:24.996]  The cool part of this book, certainly it'll speak to you personally, your life, your lifestyle, your money, your investments, but it also can be generalized into the nation, what's going on as a nation.
[00:23:25.056 --> 00:23:27.457]  We do these same things personally that we do as a nation.
[00:23:27.837 --> 00:23:37.479]  Dr. Barry's book, Cha-Ching Wisdom, presents many facets of your relationship with the once almighty dollar and how current national and international politics affect your daily life.
[00:23:37.659 --> 00:23:39.280]  Some of the other things are about that.
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:40.940]  They're not just economic.
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:41.901]  They're philosophical.
[00:23:42.001 --> 00:23:43.662]  There's psychology involved in this book.
[00:23:43.682 --> 00:23:45.102]  There's philosophy involved in this book.
[00:23:45.322 --> 00:23:47.643]  Read Cha-Ching Wisdom by Dr. David Barry.
[00:23:47.784 --> 00:23:47.984]  Only $9.95.
[00:23:48.884 --> 00:23:51.145]  Available at cha-chingwisdom.com.

[00:23:55.767 --> 00:23:57.408]  cha-chingwisdom.com
[00:24:26.351 --> 00:24:28.554]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:24:28.654 --> 00:24:29.515]  to 2 p.m.
[00:24:30.136 --> 00:24:32.439]  Central Standard Time, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:34.142]  We are live.
[00:24:34.162 --> 00:24:37.527]  I'll be back this Sunday, live, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:24:37.727 --> 00:24:40.030]  Central Standard Time as well.
[00:24:40.531 --> 00:24:43.335]  And we've got four new radio stations, big ones.
[00:24:43.795 --> 00:24:47.878]  Won the number one talk station, 100,000 watt FM, in Minneapolis, St.
[00:24:47.918 --> 00:24:49.319]  Paul, picking up the Sunday show.
[00:24:49.959 --> 00:24:51.601]  Very excited about that.
[00:24:51.621 --> 00:24:53.522]  A lot of stations we need to be thanking on air.
[00:24:53.542 --> 00:25:06.531]  A lot of liners for stations I know I'm supposed to cut in the last week, and I haven't, including for XM, because we have been absolutely hammered with this radio active situation that is unfolding.
[00:25:06.771 --> 00:25:11.735]  And again, the first radiation from just the leaks on Friday has reached the West Coast.
[00:25:12.537 --> 00:25:26.768]  We're going to be breaking all of that news down in detail with a leading radiation expert who has been featured by CNN, Fox, the New York Times, you name it.
[00:25:27.128 --> 00:25:29.730]  We're going to be talking to Shane Connor coming up.
[00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:35.014]  He's the biggest supplier to the military of Geiger counters and other systems.
[00:25:35.034 --> 00:25:35.994]  He's going to be breaking down
[00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:37.470]  I don't
[00:25:52.364 --> 00:25:57.209]  into the Libya situation as the rebels began to be routed.
[00:25:57.269 --> 00:26:00.952]  The openly funded by the Saudi Arabians, Al Qaeda.
[00:26:01.113 --> 00:26:02.434]  Qaddafi's actually telling the truth on that.
[00:26:02.474 --> 00:26:05.617]  He's not a good guy, but compared to them, he's a lesser of two evils.
[00:26:10.001 --> 00:26:18.167]  When they thought they could defeat him with just the ground forces and the weapons pouring in from globalist-controlled Egypt and Saudi Arabia, they were acting like they weren't involved in it.
[00:26:18.207 --> 00:26:31.638]  The minute he began to take all the cities back, the rebels only have three cities left, he's taken back scores of towns and cities from them, and the minute he started to roll into Benghazi was when they passed a no-fly resolution.
[00:26:32.492 --> 00:26:37.697]  Which, Ron Paul's pointed out, is unconstitutional, it's an act of war, it violates the UN Charter.
[00:26:37.978 --> 00:26:42.022]  We have all that detailed at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:26:42.362 --> 00:26:46.687]  And they're trying to put an even more radical, extreme group of people in there.
[00:26:46.707 --> 00:26:49.630]  Remember, Gaddafi, six years ago, made a deal with the West.
[00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:55.798]  But they want the trillions and trillions of dollars of oil, the most oil-rich country in Africa.
[00:26:56.219 --> 00:27:05.231]  And a guy who's given leadership to Africa outside of globalist control, he's spoken out against the vaccines, sterilizing people that they've caught being filled with HIV as well.
[00:27:07.233 --> 00:27:13.980]  He's a real socialist, a horrible, corrupt kingpin, but he actually serves out goodies to the public.
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:24.971]  He's developed and modernized Libya, and in the no-fly, double-speak, double-think Orwellville, they state including bombardments, and they've announced the French
[00:27:25.632 --> 00:27:27.714]  The British, NATO, U.S.
[00:27:27.935 --> 00:27:41.929]  missile cruiser ships with cruise missiles are preparing, they said as early as this morning, but last time I checked the bombardment hadn't begun, to begin attacking Muammar Qaddafi's military bases and emplacements.
[00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:46.454]  And the media is hyping 25 dead in bombardment of Qaddafi forces.
[00:27:48.496 --> 00:27:52.338]  So, that is just some of the news and information.
[00:27:52.418 --> 00:27:58.502]  So, you've got these rebels that they're calling protesters, attacking military bases, killing military, killing police.
[00:27:59.302 --> 00:28:02.144]  Whether you're for them or against them, the point is they're a military operation.
[00:28:02.624 --> 00:28:06.947]  And when Qaddafi targets them, the media lies and says he's targeted civilians.
[00:28:06.967 --> 00:28:08.688]  Turned out that wasn't true three weeks ago.
[00:28:09.048 --> 00:28:14.071]  Turns out a month ago he didn't flee, as the British Foreign Ministry said, to Venezuela.
[00:28:14.591 --> 00:28:16.191]  Turned out he hadn't stepped down.
[00:28:16.771 --> 00:28:17.772]  They keep saying he fled.
[00:28:17.852 --> 00:28:18.912]  Then, no, he stepped down.
[00:28:18.992 --> 00:28:22.292]  No, he's running to Zimbabwe to bolster the forces.
[00:28:23.173 --> 00:28:38.495]  And so as soon as he was about to go into the last big city they held, and a few other little towns in the east, the media comes out and the UN comes out and says, 10 to 0, we're voting for no-fly to help the humanitarian population.
[00:28:39.196 --> 00:28:40.976]  And they will bomb their water treatment plants.
[00:28:41.866 --> 00:28:42.887]  in their humanitarian effort.
[00:28:42.907 --> 00:28:45.989]  They always do in Serbia, Iraq, you name it.
[00:28:46.249 --> 00:28:47.710]  They will bomb the government buildings.
[00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:49.591]  They will bomb the military bases.
[00:28:49.871 --> 00:28:52.813]  They will bomb all the airfields, both military and civilian.
[00:28:53.113 --> 00:29:05.822]  They will bomb the country end-to-end as they're gearing up to do, but as of this minute they have not attacked because Muammar Gaddafi, the slimy, slick dictator of 40 years, is a survivor.
[00:29:06.866 --> 00:29:07.106]  And he's
[00:29:27.685 --> 00:29:31.528]  Egypt that borders them to the east out of Saudi Arabia.
[00:29:31.948 --> 00:29:34.370]  This is Al-Qaeda attacking me, which is actually true.
[00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:38.393]  That's Al-Qaeda means CIA brigade in the CIA database.
[00:29:38.413 --> 00:29:39.814]  That's been out since the 80s.
[00:29:40.615 --> 00:29:43.477]  And so now there's some jockeying.
[00:29:43.677 --> 00:29:45.879]  I believe they're going to go ahead and still start bombing him.
[00:29:46.099 --> 00:29:47.420]  The UN has signaled that.
[00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:50.742]  So now a whole new war on top of all the other bedlam.
[00:29:50.982 --> 00:29:51.883]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.383 --> 00:29:53.884]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.893 --> 00:29:57.694]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.915 --> 00:30:05.556]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:30:05.936 --> 00:30:08.937]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:30:09.177 --> 00:30:13.958]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:30:13.978 --> 00:30:20.179]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:30:20.359 --> 00:30:22.600]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:23.420]  Tim Geithner?
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:23.680]  Bernanke?
[00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:24.301]  They're arsonists!
[00:30:24.321 --> 00:30:25.061]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:30:25.081 --> 00:30:26.762]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:30:42.048 --> 00:30:43.890]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:30:43.910 --> 00:30:48.957]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:30:49.337 --> 00:30:58.449]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:31:00.455 --> 00:31:04.678]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:31:04.998 --> 00:31:05.599]  Number 1.
[00:31:05.919 --> 00:31:09.061]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:31:09.342 --> 00:31:09.902]  Number 2.
[00:31:10.202 --> 00:31:14.766]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:31:15.086 --> 00:31:15.526]  It's true.
[00:31:15.826 --> 00:31:20.390]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:21.250]  Number 3.
[00:31:21.531 --> 00:31:24.813]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:31:25.133 --> 00:31:28.816]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:31:29.016 --> 00:31:29.576]  Number 4.
[00:31:29.817 --> 00:31:32.178]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:31:32.579 --> 00:31:35.961]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:31:36.262 --> 00:31:36.482]  Number 5.
[00:31:37.042 --> 00:31:40.965]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:31:41.185 --> 00:31:45.949]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:31:46.249 --> 00:31:50.272]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:50.412 --> 00:31:51.973]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:52.194 --> 00:31:54.275]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:31:54.435 --> 00:31:56.717]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:31:56.737 --> 00:31:57.418]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:31:57.438 --> 00:32:00.700]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:32:08.426 --> 00:32:10.727]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:32:10.987 --> 00:32:16.168]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:32:16.368 --> 00:32:19.148]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:32:19.408 --> 00:32:21.529]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:32:21.729 --> 00:32:27.650]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:31.131]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:32:31.331 --> 00:32:36.874]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:32:37.114 --> 00:32:38.435]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:32:38.755 --> 00:32:39.956]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:32:40.056 --> 00:32:42.617]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:32:42.737 --> 00:32:46.779]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:32:46.959 --> 00:32:51.462]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[00:32:51.582 --> 00:32:54.023]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[00:32:54.183 --> 00:32:57.865]  Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[00:32:58.045 --> 00:32:59.046]  That's endofamerica3.com.
[00:33:07.681 --> 00:33:11.725]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:33:12.665 --> 00:33:14.107]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:33:28.291 --> 00:33:29.612]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[00:33:29.632 --> 00:33:30.312]  to 2 p.m.
[00:33:30.352 --> 00:33:31.213]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:33:31.233 --> 00:33:40.679]  Dr. Nick Begich is joining us in the next hour, then Bob Chapman on the economy, on the open announcement that the Federal Reserve has been manipulating currency markets worldwide.
[00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:51.906]  But I'm going to be breaking down here on air for everyone the latest developments at the Fukushima, Chernobyl-style disaster in Japan.
[00:33:52.426 --> 00:33:54.588]  AP reporting fallout has reached the
[00:33:55.568 --> 00:34:21.512]  uh... western coast uh... arriving in los angeles reuters headline very low radiation detected on west coast remember that's the first radiation from uh... last friday when they just had a basic at the facility not the explosion in fukushima reactor one on saturday the giant mushroom cloud explosion on monday at fukushima uh... max mark one plutonium-based
[00:34:22.386 --> 00:34:22.586]  Thank you
[00:34:52.926 --> 00:34:59.351]  Who supplies the potassium iodide pills to the military, who supplies it to the government, who supplies it to FEMA.
[00:35:00.012 --> 00:35:09.079]  He's the biggest holder of Geiger counters and has the biggest lab that basically sets them and calibrates them.
[00:35:10.039 --> 00:35:15.965]  He also, again, is the biggest manufacturer of the potassium iodide.
[00:35:16.505 --> 00:35:25.493]  The pills are all gone, but he has the raw base potassium iodine material that's enough for 20 adults, 200...
[00:35:29.256 --> 00:35:35.061]  We're gonna have him break it all down and the fact that you'll want to talk to your physician first.
[00:35:35.141 --> 00:35:37.583]  Of course, the radiation levels would have had to go up first.
[00:35:38.124 --> 00:35:39.225]  He's got a whole fact sheet.
[00:35:39.245 --> 00:35:41.707]  We've got it at InfoWars.com.
[00:35:41.967 --> 00:35:44.489]  He is completely sold out, even to his distributors.
[00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:47.052]  My guys bought most of it yesterday.
[00:35:47.572 --> 00:35:48.733]  That sold out overnight.
[00:35:48.833 --> 00:35:50.014]  They got back there this morning.
[00:35:50.034 --> 00:35:51.455]  They're coming back with
[00:35:52.296 --> 00:35:52.856]  The rest of it.
[00:35:52.916 --> 00:35:56.078]  He has basically completely sold out of it.
[00:35:56.178 --> 00:36:00.880]  The last remaining supplies right now at Infowars.com.
[00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:05.382]  And we are limiting how many each person can get, so more people can get a hold of it.
[00:36:05.662 --> 00:36:09.784]  This all started because the pills I bought a decade ago were expired.
[00:36:10.584 --> 00:36:14.906]  And I began to, for the rest of the crew, look around for it.
[00:36:15.307 --> 00:36:17.688]  And hiding in plain view, I'm like, wait a minute, Shane Connor,
[00:36:18.999 --> 00:36:20.341]  He's the huge guy with nuclear.
[00:36:20.641 --> 00:36:25.545]  He's the guy that makes a little Geiger counter detectors and recalibrates the government ones.
[00:36:26.346 --> 00:36:27.186]  Let's call him.
[00:36:27.787 --> 00:36:32.110]  And of course it turned out he was one of the only suppliers left in the country with it.
[00:36:32.471 --> 00:36:35.994]  And we've now gotten the remaining of his stock available now.
[00:36:36.014 --> 00:36:39.797]  We're going to be shipping it out as quickly as possible at Infowars.com.
[00:36:39.817 --> 00:36:40.617]  Now understand something.
[00:36:41.118 --> 00:36:44.020]  In three hours last night what we bought yesterday sold overnight.
[00:36:44.561 --> 00:36:46.963]  This will probably sell out by the end of the day.
[00:36:47.643 --> 00:36:48.564]  And then this is it.
[00:36:48.884 --> 00:36:50.225]  This is all we've got.
[00:36:50.925 --> 00:36:55.108]  But I want to explain this and the fact sheet he's got and have him break it down.
[00:36:55.389 --> 00:37:00.252]  The headline up on InfoWars.com with a link to the online video bookstore shopping cart that has it.
[00:37:00.632 --> 00:37:04.775]  InfoWars has some of the only potassium iodine in the United States.
[00:37:04.855 --> 00:37:06.737]  Now, sir, you're the expert on this.
[00:37:07.177 --> 00:37:09.098]  Decades involved in this.
[00:37:09.458 --> 00:37:14.322]  Break down exactly what this product is, what it does for people that are out there.
[00:37:14.562 --> 00:37:33.275]  Oh, and let me just add, for those that don't know, you've been featured in the Boston Globe, Newsmax, World Net Daily, National Defense Mag, Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, Washington Post, New York Times, USA Today, San Francisco Chronicle, Wall Street Journal, CNN, Newsday, Glenn Beck, the list goes on and on.
[00:37:33.295 --> 00:37:40.279]  I mean, you are a preeminent expert that we've got here, and thank God you were hiding in plain view just south of us in Gonzales, Texas.
[00:37:40.599 --> 00:37:44.302]  Break down exactly what this product is for folks that are out there.
[00:37:45.323 --> 00:37:48.688]  Alex, thanks for having me on and thanks for getting these products out.
[00:37:48.768 --> 00:37:52.394]  They're not going to do anybody any good in my warehouse when people need them in their homes.
[00:37:54.946 --> 00:38:06.891]  For any radiological event, whether it's a nuclear bomb or what we're seeing going on in Japan here, the greatest threat, the further you get downwind, is always radioactive iodine.
[00:38:07.091 --> 00:38:09.692]  Health physicists always agree that's the problem.
[00:38:10.033 --> 00:38:11.893]  That was the problem at Chernobyl.
[00:38:12.053 --> 00:38:22.158]  The further you got away from ground zero, the casualties, almost exclusively, have been from radioactive iodine causing damage to your thyroid gland.
[00:38:22.638 --> 00:38:47.325]  What potassium iodide does, and the FDA has recognized this and endorsed it for literally 50 to 60 years now, is that when you take that before you're exposed, and you could possibly ingest or inhale radioactive iodide, if you could take potassium iodide beforehand, you will saturate and fill up your thyroid gland with safe, stable iodine.
[00:38:47.893 --> 00:38:53.339]  Now, and you can take it as little as a half hour before it arrives, but you're playing beat the clock.
[00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:56.983]  Whatever gets to your thyroid gland first stays there.
[00:38:57.344 --> 00:39:06.154]  And if you have safe, stable iodine in place, then the radioactive iodine, if you later inhale or ingest it in contaminated milk or other products,
[00:39:06.634 --> 00:39:08.255]  Your kidneys simply eliminate it.
[00:39:08.636 --> 00:39:13.960]  It gives you almost 100% protection against thyroid cancer and all these other problems.
[00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:24.929]  And we document on our website from our own nuclear weapons testing the number of thyroid cancers that we had in this country right up close with that.
[00:39:25.309 --> 00:39:35.517]  In fact, the National Cancer Institute study estimating thyroid doses of I-131 received by Americans from Nevada Atmospheric Nuclear Bomb Test
[00:39:36.232 --> 00:39:42.274]  They say it likely generated from 10,000 to 75,000 cases of thyroid cancer.
[00:39:42.975 --> 00:39:58.901]  And we also saw, and we show it on our website, where a Chinese test done back in, let me get back straight for you, done back in December 28, 1966, resulted in a fallout cloud covering most of the United States.
[00:40:00.045 --> 00:40:05.628]  About four days later, and we had it showing up in milk across the country.
[00:40:05.928 --> 00:40:14.032]  Now, those levels that showed up from that test, they were not enough that you would have pulled the milk.
[00:40:14.552 --> 00:40:17.993]  But it shows that it will cover the complete country.
[00:40:18.393 --> 00:40:28.398]  Chernobyl, we had it showing up in milk from cows in Washington, the state of Washington, from the pastures, where normally they would have
[00:40:29.045 --> 00:40:34.787]  Two to four pico curies in the milk naturally of radioactive iodine.
[00:40:35.127 --> 00:40:37.428]  They were having elevated levels over 400.
[00:40:37.588 --> 00:40:44.530]  Now, it's important to get educated when we start hearing people talking about these huge increases.
[00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:49.971]  They still wouldn't have pulled the milk until it got ten times higher than that.
[00:40:50.592 --> 00:40:55.133]  So, people need to get educated about this so that they don't panic.
[00:40:56.009 --> 00:41:05.636]  We risk here, without the education, that the panic could be actually more widespread than the fallout itself.
[00:41:05.656 --> 00:41:08.698]  Okay, well let's break that down, but I want to just give people the latest headline.
[00:41:08.718 --> 00:41:10.700]  Radiation drives back crews.
[00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:12.921]  Attempting to rain in reactor.
[00:41:12.941 --> 00:41:18.503]  AP Reuters are all reporting that there's obviously been a lot of radiation already released.
[00:41:18.903 --> 00:41:21.844]  600,000 rods blown in all directions, caught on fire, spent rods.
[00:41:22.325 --> 00:41:27.667]  Two of the six reactors' internal containment has been breached as of Tuesday.
[00:41:27.687 --> 00:41:29.688]  You know, three, four days ago.
[00:41:30.608 --> 00:41:34.309]  But now they're talking more and more about giving up hope.
[00:41:34.830 --> 00:41:37.971]  If those reactors fully melt down, I've
[00:41:38.231 --> 00:41:40.373]  I've had nuclear physicists on just yesterday.
[00:41:40.413 --> 00:41:45.417]  They said they could actually explode like we saw in the 50s in Russia.
[00:41:47.799 --> 00:41:50.721]  Yeah, if we have an event and it's stopped,
[00:41:55.768 --> 00:41:57.108]  You know, we can deal with that.
[00:41:57.188 --> 00:42:11.851]  My concern is if we get these meltdowns going where we've got a continual radioactive volcano, essentially, spewing this stuff out continually, then we've got some major, major serious problems here because it's never going to quit.
[00:42:12.191 --> 00:42:22.453]  It's not going to be a Chernobyl that everybody was able to take KI and they had no thyroid cancer and then it blew out of the area, went around the world and that was it.
[00:42:23.618 --> 00:42:31.985]  My concern watching, and that's what I've always thought would happen with this Japanese thing, but as the days went on, every eight hours they were losing another reactor.
[00:42:32.642 --> 00:42:37.925]  So all bets are off on this episode, what's going on.
[00:42:38.045 --> 00:42:44.169]  Absolutely, and just to be clear for people, and I want to go over the facts with you because you're the expert.
[00:42:44.589 --> 00:42:51.273]  Again, you know, you've developed the pills, made the pills, one of the biggest sellers to the government, your nuke alert to the Pentagon, Homeland Security.
[00:42:51.333 --> 00:42:52.714]  I mean, you're the big dog.
[00:42:53.294 --> 00:42:58.557]  Explain to us what this product is, folks, when they get it at InfoWars.com, they need to consult.
[00:42:59.017 --> 00:42:59.398]  This is it!
[00:43:19.235 --> 00:43:19.775]  No, I fully agree with you.
[00:43:19.795 --> 00:43:20.776]  There's no tablets to be had.
[00:43:20.796 --> 00:43:24.838]  We're the national distributor of one of the three major ones.
[00:43:42.484 --> 00:43:45.305]  And, uh, we're not going to be... The government stepped in.
[00:43:45.325 --> 00:43:47.666]  They take all of the, uh, manufacturing.
[00:43:47.686 --> 00:43:51.247]  We may be three to six months before we get supplies.
[00:43:51.267 --> 00:43:55.548]  The government... When my guys were there yesterday, there were Japanese there buying it for Japan.
[00:43:55.568 --> 00:43:57.489]  The U.S., I don't know if you can talk about it, but the U.S.
[00:43:57.529 --> 00:44:01.570]  government had just stepped in and actually bought most of what you had, the nuke strips.
[00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:09.953]  Uh, I mean, uh, we've got confirmed reports they're telling medical facilities to hoard the potassium iodine tablets.
[00:44:10.812 --> 00:44:24.384]  Yeah, what I did is I took last fall, I went ahead and had one ton, 100 pound drum of potassium iodide, USP.
[00:44:24.444 --> 00:44:28.708]  It's what we've made tablets with in the past when we were making tablets ourselves.
[00:44:29.348 --> 00:44:31.911]  This is the exact same thing that's in the tablets.
[00:44:31.931 --> 00:44:33.332]  This is the active ingredient.
[00:44:33.983 --> 00:44:43.628]  And we took one ton, literal one ton of it, and we made 32,000 vials, of which you, Alex, have the last of it at this point.
[00:44:44.288 --> 00:45:03.077]  And I'm thrilled that you came on board with this, because we got so swamped, we had to shut down our phone and our internet, taking orders online at 10.30 Monday, so that we can fill those orders, and our distributors and you, Alex, are getting this stuff out there.
[00:45:03.097 --> 00:45:03.557]  But anyways,
[00:45:04.702 --> 00:45:21.136]  The 26 grams that you get is the exact amount that if you pour it into a 1 liter bottle of water, shake it up, you have a potassium iodide solution where every measuring teaspoon or 5 milliliters will be at 1 adult daily dose.
[00:45:21.617 --> 00:45:25.660]  And what you're looking at is typically you would take it for 7 to 10 days,
[00:45:26.801 --> 00:45:31.343]  But let me emphasize, when you get this, do not start taking it now.
[00:45:32.384 --> 00:45:33.604]  We are not at that point.
[00:45:33.644 --> 00:45:37.326]  You just need to have it so that, because you won't be able to get it.
[00:45:37.366 --> 00:45:42.728]  And we have a detailed fact sheet at InfoWars.com on the shopping cart with it and the entire breakdown.
[00:45:42.768 --> 00:45:46.010]  Consult your physician, healthcare provider, follow the indications.
[00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:55.934]  At what point would you, because the government may lie about radiation on the West Coast, at what point, if they report 10 times, 20 times normal radiation, when would you take this?
[00:45:56.684 --> 00:45:59.306]  Listen, when Chernobyl happened, we didn't have the internet.
[00:45:59.326 --> 00:46:01.849]  We didn't have as many... It snuck up on everybody.
[00:46:02.329 --> 00:46:05.432]  We have got... I've got nuclear all over the country.
[00:46:05.492 --> 00:46:06.553]  I've got them in Japan.
[00:46:07.554 --> 00:46:11.358]  Many, many other people are up to speed on this, and we've got the internet.
[00:46:11.578 --> 00:46:13.419]  This thing is not going to sneak up on us.
[00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:17.383]  People need to get prepared, but it's not going to sneak up on us.
[00:46:17.884 --> 00:46:21.447]  And the government cannot not
[00:46:22.133 --> 00:46:29.080]  Tell people to take it when it's time to take it because too many people are watching this and they're going to be looking at it independently.
[00:46:29.481 --> 00:46:35.126]  So they're not going to be able to hide or slow down or delay telling people to take it.
[00:46:35.407 --> 00:46:39.571]  The reason they would want to delay it is because then that shows up.
[00:46:39.971 --> 00:46:41.353]  They don't have any for anyone.
[00:46:42.185 --> 00:46:43.066]  There's not enough.
[00:46:43.206 --> 00:46:47.668]  There were never enough pills even manufactured that we would have enough.
[00:46:47.949 --> 00:46:51.391]  Well, that's what you said 12 years ago when you first came on our show.
[00:46:51.491 --> 00:46:56.654]  Raymond Teague, a NASA scientist, friend of mine, electrical engineer, worked on the Apollo missions.
[00:46:57.194 --> 00:47:09.281]  He was always very concerned about this and, you know, introduced me to you years ago, concerned just about nuclear power plants and if they ever had a meltdown, that everybody in the surrounding area
[00:47:11.002 --> 00:47:25.370]  Go to my website and read the Ill Winds article, when ill winds blow from afar.
[00:47:26.051 --> 00:47:33.315]  If you read this, you will be the resident Joe expert in your county for all that we're dealing with here.
[00:47:33.866 --> 00:47:38.048]  We don't have the product available to sell directly from our website.
[00:47:38.168 --> 00:47:45.312]  Get that from Alex, but you can get the information when an ill wind blows from afar at KI4U.com.
[00:47:45.553 --> 00:47:50.175]  Do you want us to mirror, uh, Mr. Conner, that article at InfoWars.com?
[00:47:50.195 --> 00:47:50.375]  Please.
[00:47:50.755 --> 00:47:51.076]  Please.
[00:47:51.676 --> 00:47:56.699]  Okay, when an ill wind blows from afar on their site, can we also go to NukeAlert.com to find that?
[00:47:57.749 --> 00:48:05.596]  No, just go to KI40.com and it'll be on the main page at the prominent link right on the first screen.
[00:48:13.403 --> 00:48:18.568]  And now again, people need to print off the two-sided PDF that we have written up by you, the expert.
[00:48:19.089 --> 00:48:22.832]  Again, still consult your physician or healthcare provider.
[00:48:22.913 --> 00:48:24.394]  Don't start taking this.
[00:48:24.414 --> 00:48:25.635]  This is an emergency backup.
[00:48:26.136 --> 00:48:35.585]  And when I was reading, the pills only last a few years, but you were telling me, Shane, that this stuff basically is indefinite because it's in the raw chemical form.
[00:48:37.023 --> 00:48:39.004]  This is the raw potassium iodide.
[00:48:39.024 --> 00:48:41.485]  Keep it dry and you don't get it too hot.
[00:48:41.945 --> 00:48:45.487]  Potassium iodide is the same thing that's in your iodized salt.
[00:48:45.967 --> 00:48:53.030]  If you look at the ingredients on the side of your salt shaker and like salt, if you don't get it wet and you don't melt it, it lasts darn near forever.
[00:48:53.170 --> 00:49:00.073]  Are the Japanese right and the Chinese rushing to buy iodine salt as the LA Times reports or will that do nothing for them?
[00:49:01.879 --> 00:49:05.062]  Well, let me just tell you about iodized salt, for instance.
[00:49:05.742 --> 00:49:19.832]  The little micrograms that are in there are good for nutritional reasons, but you would have to eat five cups of salt a day to get the same amount of KI as you do out of either the tablet dose or... And that would kill you.
[00:49:19.972 --> 00:49:20.653]  And that would kill you.
[00:49:20.893 --> 00:49:21.814]  Oh, that would kill you.
[00:49:22.254 --> 00:49:26.978]  Now, there's a lot of nutritional products out there that do have some iodine.
[00:49:27.038 --> 00:49:28.739]  It's good for nutritional reasons.
[00:49:29.252 --> 00:49:35.357]  But you need to end up with, and we're talking adults, 130 milligrams per day.
[00:49:35.377 --> 00:49:49.267]  Okay, briefly, how many people, how many adults will one of these vials, one of these containers of potassium iodide, USP, 26 grams, how many people will this take care of for seven days to fill the thyroid?
[00:49:50.106 --> 00:50:03.419]  It's got 200 adult daily doses, or at least 400 child doses, and depending on how young the children are, potentially 600 or 800 children if they're very small.
[00:50:03.859 --> 00:50:06.702]  And the dosing instructions are right on there.
[00:50:06.742 --> 00:50:10.286]  By the way, when we get in short supply, it's always
[00:50:10.846 --> 00:50:11.167]  We're good.
[00:50:28.662 --> 00:50:31.725]  Very quickly, many times within the year after exposure.
[00:50:45.539 --> 00:50:51.085]  Uh, is the place to get the remaining supply and I don't think it's going to be around very, very quickly.
[00:50:51.125 --> 00:50:55.129]  We are limiting how many people can order for each, uh, person.
[00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:59.333]  Uh, but, uh, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:50:59.413 --> 00:51:00.915]  Shane Connor, Key Information.
[00:51:01.055 --> 00:51:05.517]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:52:00.638 --> 00:52:02.940]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:05.203]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:52:05.223 --> 00:52:08.105]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:08.546 --> 00:52:13.290]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:13.651 --> 00:52:17.855]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:18.155 --> 00:52:20.499]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:20.619 --> 00:52:23.043]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:23.383 --> 00:52:25.967]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:26.307 --> 00:52:33.919]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:34.235 --> 00:52:39.497]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:39.637 --> 00:52:42.417]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:42.477 --> 00:52:45.898]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:46.158 --> 00:52:47.059]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:47.239 --> 00:52:48.539]  You're everyone else.

[00:54:05.009 --> 00:54:11.272]  Shane Connor, the inventor of the Nuke Alert, radiation expert who supplies the US government, is our guest for another five minutes.
[00:54:11.792 --> 00:54:14.534]  He gave us some good news in his article.
[00:54:15.094 --> 00:54:21.317]  When an ill wind blows from afar, we're going to post it at InfoWars.com right now.
[00:54:21.337 --> 00:54:24.578]  We'll also put it on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:54:25.619 --> 00:54:29.741]  It will obviously sell out very quickly, the potassium iodide USP.
[00:54:30.501 --> 00:54:35.242]  Yeah, the very important thing to get across here and emphasize over and over again is that now we're talking about actual iodine products
[00:54:59.583 --> 00:55:03.928]  And we're not talking about ingesting them, drinking them, or swallowing them.
[00:55:04.228 --> 00:55:06.891]  I'm talking about, for instance, tincture of iodine.
[00:55:07.432 --> 00:55:09.374]  Now, you do not drink that.
[00:55:09.734 --> 00:55:12.777]  And make sure that people understand if you start telling them about this.
[00:55:12.858 --> 00:55:15.280]  But if you take tincture of iodine, like 2%,
[00:55:17.130 --> 00:55:23.958]  Putting that on your skin, and we show in this article that you're posting, Alex, how much for a 2% picture of iodine.
[00:55:24.578 --> 00:55:35.070]  If you put that, like 8 milliliters, for an adult on your abdomen or forearm each day, you will get a thyroid-protecting dose.
[00:55:35.630 --> 00:55:37.431]  Darn near as good as the tablet.
[00:55:37.671 --> 00:55:49.318]  Now, it's not a specific dosing because it evaporates different depending on the humidity at the time, people absorb differently through their skin, rubbing it off, etc.
[00:55:49.539 --> 00:55:58.044]  But for most people, and we link to the tests that show this, this has all been scientifically determined with human studies.
[00:55:58.624 --> 00:56:10.163]  That you will get a blocking dose, a thyroid blocking dose, absorbing the tincture of iodine and other iodine products topically on your skin.
[00:56:10.483 --> 00:56:12.827]  But again, I need to emphasize two things.
[00:56:13.607 --> 00:56:18.269]  Make sure if you talk about this to anybody, they don't think that you're talking about drinking this stuff.
[00:56:18.309 --> 00:56:19.009]  It's poison.
[00:56:19.309 --> 00:56:23.091]  But topically, you can safely absorb a thyroid-blocking dose.
[00:56:23.131 --> 00:56:27.453]  And we're not talking about the product on InfoWars.com, the potassium iodide USP.
[00:56:27.713 --> 00:56:31.714]  And you still talk to a doctor about that, even when the radiation, if and when it goes up.
[00:56:32.074 --> 00:56:40.358]  You're talking about tincture of iodine, rubbing it on the stomach or on the forearms, once a day, a limited amount, will also pretty much have the same effect.
[00:56:40.418 --> 00:56:40.898]  But that's
[00:56:41.298 --> 00:56:42.779]  All broken down in your article.
[00:56:43.019 --> 00:56:49.101]  You still must consult a physician or a health care provider before you do that.
[00:56:49.761 --> 00:56:50.361]  Absolutely.
[00:56:50.862 --> 00:56:55.383]  And usually the only reason... And by the way, the federal government should be doing all this right now.
[00:56:55.443 --> 00:56:56.404]  We shouldn't be having to do it.
[00:56:57.184 --> 00:57:01.246]  That has been our mantra for over 12 years.
[00:57:01.646 --> 00:57:05.827]  Is that what we do in our little way, they should be doing in a big way all the time.
[00:57:06.167 --> 00:57:10.269]  And I'd look at people out of business as being redundant if they were doing their job.
[00:57:11.104 --> 00:57:15.565]  Well, you saw this coming from far away, Shane Conner, and we appreciate you.
[00:57:15.605 --> 00:57:17.166]  Again, the only remaining supply.
[00:57:17.206 --> 00:57:17.866]  He's out now.
[00:57:17.986 --> 00:57:20.227]  We have it because they can't handle the orders.
[00:57:20.707 --> 00:57:22.267]  Infowars.com.
[00:57:22.987 --> 00:57:28.149]  And it's a good thing we only got this much because this will take us four or five days to get out as quickly as we can on the order they received.
[00:57:28.629 --> 00:57:29.970]  And we're shipping it two to three day.
[00:57:30.610 --> 00:57:30.910]  U.S.
[00:57:30.970 --> 00:57:35.533]  priority mail, but they're racing right now to get out the orders that came in last night and the orders that come in.
[00:57:35.553 --> 00:57:39.155]  They're going to be working over the weekend to have this out to you Monday and Tuesday.
[00:57:39.555 --> 00:57:44.858]  Infowars.com, but certainly that great news about tincture of iodine that you do not drink.
[00:57:45.178 --> 00:57:49.080]  It's not this product, but it's rubbed on the skin only if the radiation goes up.
[00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:53.362]  And again, technically for yourself personally, we only got a minute left, Shane.
[00:57:53.703 --> 00:57:56.384]  When would you take this product?
[00:57:56.464 --> 00:57:57.885]  How high would the radiation have to be?
[00:57:59.417 --> 00:58:08.820]  When we've got a confirmation, I've got people I'm talking to and listening to on health physics sites, both sides.
[00:58:09.420 --> 00:58:12.401]  And that's what I'm watching right now.
[00:58:12.901 --> 00:58:16.162]  The government, the big thing is the government can't sit on this.
[00:58:16.383 --> 00:58:19.884]  Too many people are watching it and we have the internet.
[00:58:20.364 --> 00:58:23.765]  At what level would you personally take it?
[00:58:27.210 --> 00:58:32.974]  I'm watching my health physicists that are keeping an eye on it right now.
[00:58:33.774 --> 00:58:34.735]  I can't give you a number.
[00:58:34.875 --> 00:58:36.016]  You'll wait and see what they say.
[00:58:36.116 --> 00:58:37.417]  Thank you so much, Shane Connor.
[00:58:37.697 --> 00:58:39.118]  Get it at InfoWars.com.
[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:45.061]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:46.622 --> 00:58:48.824]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:58.602]  Alex has told you that the Mideast uprisings over food prices and shortages caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide.
[00:58:58.942 --> 00:59:01.183]  We're seeing the impact right here in the United States.
[00:59:01.623 --> 00:59:10.426]  Ethanol, that was supposed to reduce petroleum use and fuel prices, hit a 30-month high in February, and pump prices are expected to reach $5 a gallon.
[00:59:10.646 --> 00:59:18.548]  Because of shipping costs, food is being priced out of the reach of millions of Americans, with an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days.
[00:59:18.909 --> 00:59:20.429]  Move quickly while you can still afford
[00:59:21.510 --> 00:59:21.950]  I think so.
[00:59:53.587 --> 00:59:55.508]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.988 --> 00:59:58.849]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.292 --> 01:00:05.953]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.613 --> 01:00:07.653]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.374 --> 01:00:09.554]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.135 --> 01:00:10.955]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.715 --> 01:00:12.636]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.256 --> 01:00:16.938]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.458 --> 01:00:21.520]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.792 --> 01:00:31.316]  Radiation is driving back emergency workers at the stricken Fukushima nuclear disaster site.
[01:00:31.756 --> 01:00:35.859]  Helicopters are trying to fly above, dumping water directly on the exposed fuel rods.
[01:00:36.999 --> 01:00:44.644]  Efforts to try to restore power to reactors at Fukushima Daiichi Complex are interrupted as high radiation forces the withdrawal of workers.
[01:00:45.484 --> 01:00:48.726]  But it's unclear whether a return of power will help.
[01:00:49.086 --> 01:00:51.407]  Spent fuel rods remain the biggest concern.
[01:00:51.727 --> 01:00:54.549]  They've strung a new power line into the area.
[01:00:54.669 --> 01:01:09.716]  Engineers at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant worked all day Friday attempting to connect a newly restored power line to reactors number one and two, but their tasks were repeatedly interrupted by the need to withdraw workers because of high radiation levels, which they won't give us.
[01:01:09.856 --> 01:01:10.517]  They just say they're high.
[01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:12.961]  Going out to the Pacific towards the U.S.
[01:01:13.001 --> 01:01:14.541]  The first, Vanguard, just hit today.
[01:01:14.581 --> 01:01:17.123]  They're calling it very low-level because it was a low-level Friday.
[01:01:17.463 --> 01:01:19.644]  That's what's hit us, the Friday radiation.
[01:01:19.964 --> 01:01:22.345]  It takes the rest of the radiation days to get here after that.
[01:01:23.105 --> 01:01:30.449]  The team said they hoped the task would be completed sometime Friday evening or in the early morning hours Saturday.
[01:01:31.269 --> 01:01:38.190]  It is not clear yet whether restoring power to the two damaged reactors will help with cooling.
[01:01:38.551 --> 01:01:55.794]  Some engineers believe the cooling pumps were irrevocably damaged by the hydrogen explosions that wreaked and wrecked the reactor buildings in the first four days after the March 10th magnitude 9 quake, or by corrosion from seawater that has been pumped into the reactor.
[01:01:55.834 --> 01:01:59.835]  At the very least, however, restoring power should restore many of the controlled functions
[01:02:00.996 --> 01:02:01.696]  of the reactor.
[01:02:02.277 --> 01:02:08.260]  But ladies and gentlemen, you have seen those explosions continuing here.
[01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:19.906]  Officials of the Tokyo Electric Power Company, which owns the facility 140 miles north of Tokyo, said they hope to have power connected to reactors number three and four by Sunday.
[01:02:20.326 --> 01:02:24.929]  Reactor number building four is now the source of the biggest concern in the site because the
[01:02:25.509 --> 01:02:31.212]  Contains spent fuel rods that may have boiled dry and releasing large amounts of radiation in the environment.
[01:02:31.232 --> 01:02:32.133]  They can also explode.
[01:02:32.633 --> 01:02:41.198]  The spent fuel rod pools do not have the containment vessels, so if the fuel rods heat up and start burning a radioactive ash, they release directly into the environment.
[01:02:41.218 --> 01:02:43.400]  That's already been going on for six days now.
[01:02:44.601 --> 01:02:46.362]  Workers first blew up Saturday.
[01:02:47.372 --> 01:03:03.024]  Workers made a second series of attempts Friday to cool the fuel rods, dumping water from helicopters and using cannons operated by Japan's Self-Defense Force to spray water into the pool, which sits in the upper level of the building housing reactor number four.
[01:03:03.344 --> 01:03:09.849]  The reactor itself has been shut down for maintenance before the earthquake, so it does not pose a problem.
[01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:11.270]  Really?
[01:03:11.290 --> 01:03:14.152]  There's reports that it could be breached as well.
[01:03:14.192 --> 01:03:15.033]  We know two of them are.
[01:03:16.267 --> 01:03:19.730]  But photographs taken by helicopters and a Global Hawk drone operated by the U.S.
[01:03:19.790 --> 01:03:30.418]  Air Force, it's so bad they won't send manned people in, indicate the water is not lasting very long in the pool, suggesting there is a major breach in the walls of the vessel holding the fuel rods.
[01:03:30.438 --> 01:03:31.539]  Well, yeah, you saw the explosions.
[01:03:32.019 --> 01:03:32.719]  According to U.S.
[01:03:32.759 --> 01:03:41.986]  Nuclear Regulatory Commission, recognizing the severity of the problem, Japan's nuclear regulatory agency today upgraded the severity of the Fukushima disaster from a 4 to a 5 on the international scale of 1 to 7.
[01:03:43.007 --> 01:03:46.509]  The 1986 Chernobyl disaster, the worst nuclear disaster in history, was rated a 7.
[01:03:46.589 --> 01:03:48.110]  Yeah, it's a 7 already.
[01:03:48.130 --> 01:03:49.151]  You can better believe that.
[01:03:49.171 --> 01:03:56.275]  A 1979 Three Mile Island incident, previously considered the second worst accident in history, was also rated a 5.
[01:03:56.916 --> 01:03:58.137]  That was nothing compared to this.
[01:03:58.757 --> 01:04:04.460]  French officials have previously called Fukushima a five, and now Japanese authorities have agreed with their assessment.
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:08.221]  But it is clear that Fukushima is a much more serious problem than Three Mile Island.
[01:04:08.502 --> 01:04:09.002]  Of course it is.
[01:04:09.422 --> 01:04:14.364]  Little or no radiation escaped from the Pennsylvania facility, but they're saying this is the same as that, and no one was injured.
[01:04:14.704 --> 01:04:21.287]  The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization, which monitors radiation globally, said Friday the minute amounts of radiation from Fukushima.
[01:04:21.347 --> 01:04:22.288]  It's minute, folks.
[01:04:22.828 --> 01:04:26.831]  Have reached the west coast of the United States, but only at barely detectable levels.
[01:04:26.891 --> 01:04:32.174]  That's because it's the stuff from Friday that were insufficient and insignificant to health.
[01:04:33.035 --> 01:04:40.660]  On Sunday, meteorologists predicted a heavy rainstorm from the Fukushima area with the prevailing winds charging towards the direction of Tokyo.
[01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:42.661]  That's bad news for Tokyo.
[01:04:43.121 --> 01:04:43.942]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:04:44.002 --> 01:04:49.548]  Dr. Nick Begich to give us his take on all things New World Order, the earthquake, HAARP.
[01:04:50.189 --> 01:04:51.050]  Could that be behind it?
[01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:51.811]  I doubt it.
[01:04:51.871 --> 01:04:57.958]  Looks like it's the sun and moon that caused this, according to top folks that we've had on, astrophysicist Pierce Corbin.
[01:04:58.558 --> 01:04:59.319]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:59.339 --> 01:04:59.760]  Stay with us.
[01:05:04.815 --> 01:05:05.736]  Tyranny is here.
[01:05:06.076 --> 01:05:09.659]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:05:09.959 --> 01:05:12.221]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:05:12.241 --> 01:05:17.705]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:05:18.126 --> 01:05:24.371]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:05:24.771 --> 01:05:30.313]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:05:30.753 --> 01:05:34.435]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[01:05:34.935 --> 01:05:38.936]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:05:39.216 --> 01:05:44.738]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:05:45.159 --> 01:05:48.140]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:50.140]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:05:50.701 --> 01:05:51.141]  It's here.

[01:06:07.615 --> 01:06:12.379]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:06:12.739 --> 01:06:19.285]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:06:21.462 --> 01:06:23.765]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:06:25.527 --> 01:06:27.951]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[01:06:39.635 --> 01:06:41.496]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:06:41.777 --> 01:06:43.258]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.

[01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:57.790]  Got it.
[01:06:58.130 --> 01:06:59.011]  Others don't.
[01:07:00.097 --> 01:07:04.320]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:05.241]  Number 1.
[01:07:05.561 --> 01:07:08.703]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:08.984 --> 01:07:09.524]  Number 2.
[01:07:09.844 --> 01:07:14.388]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:07:14.728 --> 01:07:15.168]  It's true.
[01:07:15.468 --> 01:07:20.032]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:07:20.352 --> 01:07:20.892]  Number 3.
[01:07:21.173 --> 01:07:24.455]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:07:24.755 --> 01:07:28.458]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:07:28.658 --> 01:07:29.198]  Number 4.
[01:07:29.458 --> 01:07:31.819]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:07:32.219 --> 01:07:35.581]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:07:35.901 --> 01:07:36.421]  Number 5.
[01:07:36.681 --> 01:07:40.603]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:07:40.823 --> 01:07:45.605]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:07:45.885 --> 01:07:49.906]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:50.066 --> 01:07:51.607]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:51.847 --> 01:07:56.449]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[01:08:02.172 --> 01:08:08.196]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.816 --> 01:08:11.798]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:21.043]  We are now 8 minutes and 16 seconds into the second hour of this worldwide transmission.
[01:08:21.623 --> 01:08:24.145]  It is the 18th day of March, 2011.
[01:08:24.885 --> 01:08:26.166]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:08:26.706 --> 01:08:38.152]  Dr. Nick Begich is our guest for the rest of the hour, then our weekly visit with Bob Chapman on what's happening in Libya, and the announcement of a no-fly zone, which means aerial bombardments of Qaddafi's emplacements.
[01:08:38.732 --> 01:08:39.533]  Another war!
[01:08:40.509 --> 01:08:42.650]  What's the larger issue here?
[01:08:42.710 --> 01:08:44.031]  Why is this happening now?
[01:08:44.591 --> 01:08:49.934]  Also, New York Fed confirms intervention in currency markets, Associated Press.
[01:08:50.515 --> 01:08:52.136]  It's all coming up today.
[01:08:52.976 --> 01:08:53.657]  Here's the latest.
[01:08:53.717 --> 01:08:57.219]  Reports of harmless radiation reaching California are a whitewash.
[01:08:57.759 --> 01:08:58.879]  Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:06.782]  Bulk of radioactive particles from Fukushima blast will not reach West Coast until Saturday through Monday when Fukushima 1 and 3 blew up.
[01:09:07.182 --> 01:09:11.004]  Takes seven days, the meteorologist predicted, for it to cross.
[01:09:11.044 --> 01:09:11.724]  They were correct.
[01:09:11.784 --> 01:09:17.566]  It hit today in California, only from small leaks that happened initially before meltdowns began.
[01:09:17.586 --> 01:09:20.527]  We know containment vessels at two were open.
[01:09:20.547 --> 01:09:25.509]  600,000 spent fuel rods blown sky-high that were stored on top of four of the reactors.
[01:09:27.290 --> 01:09:40.569]  They're also reporting that the Japanese have had to pull back on relief efforts because the radiation is so high, but they're not reporting the radiation in those two states or prefectures right around Fukushima, the lion's share of it blowing out.
[01:09:41.874 --> 01:09:42.094]  I think?
[01:10:03.371 --> 01:10:05.553]  He has several degrees.
[01:10:06.394 --> 01:10:08.356]  He is a, well, we'll go over all of that.
[01:10:08.416 --> 01:10:13.300]  He has been pursuing independent research into the science and politics of most of his adult life.
[01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:21.748]  Begich is the Regional Received Doctor of Medicine, Alternative Honors for Independent Work in Health and Political Science.
[01:10:22.549 --> 01:10:23.830]  And it just continues there.
[01:10:24.751 --> 01:10:27.012]  With all of his groundbreaking work on HAARP.
[01:10:27.912 --> 01:10:30.353]  He's also been an expert speaker before the European Parliament.
[01:10:30.853 --> 01:10:36.595]  He has spoken on various issues from groups representing citizens' concerns, statesmen, elected officials, scientists and others.
[01:10:36.935 --> 01:10:39.256]  He's the publisher and co-author of Earth Pulse Press.
[01:10:39.856 --> 01:10:41.917]  He served as the tribal advisor village planner.
[01:10:42.978 --> 01:10:43.158]  I'm
[01:11:05.971 --> 01:11:07.974]  Yeah, this has always been a concern for Alaska.
[01:11:08.034 --> 01:11:10.857]  In fact, if you remember back a number of years ago, there was the
[01:11:24.774 --> 01:11:34.539]  The story from the Bologna Foundation was one who carried it out of Europe, but it was the exposed nuclear cores in the Arctic from the old Soviet Union.
[01:11:34.559 --> 01:11:39.442]  They were just kind of sitting out there in the drift from all that, and submarines and so on.
[01:11:39.482 --> 01:11:42.143]  But the currents actually flow into the Gulf of Alaska.
[01:11:42.163 --> 01:11:46.366]  This is what, you know, why South Central Alaska stays warm.
[01:11:46.386 --> 01:11:48.807]  We've got this Japanese, what they call the Japanese Current.
[01:11:49.367 --> 01:12:16.111]  And so this, the entire radioactive sort of cloud and just the way in which atmosphere moves, you know, eventually ends up in the Arctic where you have the shortest food chain because you have a real short chain from lichens and things that grow in tundra areas in the far north where the biggest concentrations end up eventually reaching and concentrating to animal populations that are ingested.
[01:12:16.658 --> 01:12:25.587]  By humans, because most people in the northern regions of Alaska are still what we call here subsistence users, where it's a major part of our diet.
[01:12:25.687 --> 01:12:34.196]  Because the alternative, because this is a place without roads, it costs more to fly interstate Alaska than to fly from Alaska to Washington DC.
[01:12:36.741 --> 01:12:37.901]  This is a big deal here.
[01:12:38.241 --> 01:12:48.284]  And we have monitors actually, they're bringing in more of them now, set up in the Anchorage Bowl area and then set up around the state for monitoring that kind of fallout.
[01:12:48.304 --> 01:12:52.505]  And it started way back just after the fall of the Soviet Union.
[01:12:53.526 --> 01:12:56.827]  And we got a fuller picture on what was happening there.
[01:12:56.847 --> 01:13:01.428]  In fact, the guy that broke that story went to jail and rushed her for treason for 10 months.
[01:13:02.128 --> 01:13:05.289]  And I lectured with him in Brussels back in
[01:13:06.358 --> 01:13:06.458]  Ah, 1997.
[01:13:07.339 --> 01:13:10.240]  It was May of 1997 that we lectured together.
[01:13:19.878 --> 01:13:28.922]  What's happening at Fukushima, the ongoing cover-ups that they've been caught in, not releasing radiation data, the 600,000 spent fuel rods, the explosions.
[01:13:29.782 --> 01:13:33.303]  Give us your expert analysis on what you think may be happening.
[01:13:33.423 --> 01:13:36.945]  Well, it's obviously, you know, melting down.
[01:13:37.505 --> 01:13:47.829]  And what we're witnessing is, I think, going to prove to be worse than anything that we saw in Three Mile Island and maybe
[01:13:48.726 --> 01:13:55.868]  You know, maybe approaching as bad as what we saw in the Ukraine a number of years ago, and that was responsible.
[01:13:55.928 --> 01:14:06.330]  When they really went in after the fact and started looking at the toxicology and the downwinders, you know, the incidence of cancers and all of that, and now you've got a fairly good demographic.
[01:14:06.350 --> 01:14:16.993]  In fact, there was an excellent person on this issue, Rosalie Bertel, who was and is considered one of the world's experts on radiological victims.
[01:14:17.742 --> 01:14:19.863]  And, you know, this is the big thing.
[01:14:20.283 --> 01:14:24.244]  It's substantially changed within that region.
[01:14:24.464 --> 01:14:27.504]  And then, of course, over time, all of that gets defined.
[01:14:27.544 --> 01:14:33.706]  And right now, I think it's sort of keeping the lid on it because of just how much real damage.
[01:14:33.746 --> 01:14:42.768]  I mean, a lot of people died in the immediate event of a tsunami, but the follow-on event of radioactive fallout will probably kill more than the 10,000, they're estimating.
[01:14:44.568 --> 01:14:55.371]  By the way, Dr. Begich, the United Nations, the New York Times, the Atomic Energy Agency estimate a million deaths in the last 25 years directly connected to Chernobyl.
[01:14:55.391 --> 01:15:02.733]  We're going to play on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers a government map of what Chernobyl did in 10 days.
[01:15:03.094 --> 01:15:04.094]  It blew all over
[01:15:06.796 --> 01:15:21.187]  I don't expect to see our government, if more radiation comes this way, warning people not to eat the fish in Alaska, warning people not to drink milk.
[01:15:22.068 --> 01:15:25.110]  I mean, if it's any indication what's happened in Dallas,
[01:15:26.011 --> 01:15:36.435]  At DFW, and what's happened in O'Hare and Chicago, the planes came in with radiation inside the cabins, their clothes, their bags, the people, and they just let them go on through.
[01:15:36.475 --> 01:15:38.776]  They didn't take it, they didn't put it in a nuclear dump.
[01:15:39.076 --> 01:15:46.879]  So it shows, and Ann Coulter's in the news today, headline, a glowing report on radiation, saying we should be thankful that this is healthy and good for us.
[01:15:48.007 --> 01:15:54.528]  You know, I think the bottom line is people should, again, sort of look out there.
[01:15:54.548 --> 01:15:58.749]  I mean, right now you can't get them up because they're sort of out of stock.
[01:15:58.849 --> 01:16:02.750]  But simple radiation detectors that pick up the background radiation.
[01:16:03.290 --> 01:16:06.871]  I had one for many years when I traveled.
[01:16:06.891 --> 01:16:12.952]  And you could kind of just measure in rads the background radiation count.
[01:16:13.032 --> 01:16:14.193]  And a few observations.
[01:16:14.273 --> 01:16:16.313]  Firstly, it does vary from place to place.
[01:16:16.989 --> 01:16:24.435]  And I was in, this would have been the middle 90s, and traveling around Europe and kind of thinking, you know, where was the downwinders?
[01:16:24.455 --> 01:16:30.239]  And there is a difference, you know, there's a substantial difference from place to place back in those days.
[01:16:30.299 --> 01:16:43.369]  But then the other observation that I made that I wasn't really aware of, most people aren't, is as you go on the ground, background radiation, you know, you'll get a count of around 20 rats, and it's, you know, pretty
[01:16:44.383 --> 01:16:47.945]  You know, that's considered pretty reasonable in some places, even less than 10 rads.
[01:16:48.405 --> 01:16:55.630]  But as you go up in elevation, you know, you get on an airplane and you start measuring your rads, when you get up to 30,000 feet, you're running about 700.
[01:16:55.670 --> 01:16:59.352]  So that's a big change.
[01:16:59.552 --> 01:17:10.479]  And so when you look at these hotspots that are running even substantially higher, but, you know, you look at pilots and stewardesses and business flyers who fly a lot of hours every year,
[01:17:11.187 --> 01:17:17.929]  And if you look at their analysis of certain kinds of cancer, you'll probably see some statistical variables there, too.
[01:17:18.069 --> 01:17:19.449]  And that's just low-level radiation.
[01:17:19.469 --> 01:17:22.190]  It's not what we're talking about here in this instance.
[01:17:22.570 --> 01:17:25.731]  Well, now the mainstream media is saying meltdowns may have occurred.
[01:17:25.771 --> 01:17:29.672]  The Japanese are covering it up right now, Dr. Begich.
[01:17:30.112 --> 01:17:36.534]  But if we do have meltdown at one or more of those, and it's blowing right across the Pacific, this is a big issue.
[01:17:36.554 --> 01:17:39.795]  But our media predominantly is still playing it down.
[01:17:39.875 --> 01:17:40.695]  Why do you think that is?
[01:17:41.161 --> 01:17:53.089]  Well, because obviously the kind of panic and at the same time the media I think is slow to really gather the data and bring it forward, just the way media runs these days.
[01:17:53.149 --> 01:18:00.854]  And there's a lot of interest in what the economic gains are, a couple hundred billion dollars worth of reconstruction.
[01:18:01.574 --> 01:18:03.315]  So you don't want to be shut out of an area.
[01:18:03.596 --> 01:18:05.577]  And I think at the same time they don't want to create panic.
[01:18:06.215 --> 01:18:06.676]  I don't think so.
[01:18:25.316 --> 01:18:29.741]  And we have those same kinds of risks presented in seismic areas in the United States.
[01:18:29.761 --> 01:18:41.472]  And the larger issue is, you know, what's the better technologies that are out there that we could be applying to energy needs to have a significantly lower risk and a lot higher yield per capital dollar?
[01:18:41.532 --> 01:18:47.258]  Because these plants not only are expensive to build and generally are overrun by cost, but
[01:18:48.089 --> 01:18:52.052]  You know, when you really look at the big picture risk, these are them.
[01:18:52.693 --> 01:18:58.237]  And in seismic areas, these are risks that we really should be considering more carefully.
[01:18:58.257 --> 01:18:59.218]  And we have.
[01:18:59.458 --> 01:19:00.079]  And this is...
[01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:04.002]  Maybe the bigger issue, you know, facing the country.
[01:19:04.283 --> 01:19:04.863]  Well, that's it.
[01:19:04.883 --> 01:19:07.985]  Because when you raise concerns about this, they call you a commie.
[01:19:08.425 --> 01:19:10.327]  And then, oh, you just don't like nuclear power.
[01:19:10.387 --> 01:19:11.628]  Folks, I'm all about power.
[01:19:11.668 --> 01:19:12.728]  I'm all about coal power.
[01:19:12.768 --> 01:19:14.289]  I'm all about hydroelectric.
[01:19:14.350 --> 01:19:15.230]  I'm all about wind.
[01:19:15.270 --> 01:19:16.871]  I'm all about technology.
[01:19:17.191 --> 01:19:26.798]  But the truth is the entire nuclear industry worldwide has a horrible history with government of covering things up, whether it's the Japanese, whether it's the Russians, the U.S.
[01:19:27.238 --> 01:19:28.920]  All of them have a horrible history.
[01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:32.322]  And I am, quite frankly, sick of it.
[01:19:32.382 --> 01:19:32.702]  Stay there.
[01:19:32.722 --> 01:19:36.885]  I want to come back and talk about where you see this going, Dr. Begich.
[01:19:36.905 --> 01:19:41.568]  And we're going to open the phones up for anybody that wants to comment on this, or Libya, or the economy.
[01:19:42.028 --> 01:19:43.810]  It's Open Line Friday with Dr. Nick Begich, 800-259-9231.
[01:19:43.830 --> 01:19:43.870]  800-259-9231.
[01:19:43.890 --> 01:19:47.952]  We'll get you up and on the air today, coming up at the 33 After, when we come into that next segment.
[01:19:47.972 --> 01:19:48.493]  Stay with us.
[01:19:48.513 --> 01:19:50.174]  We'll be right back with Dr. Nick Begich.
[01:20:01.209 --> 01:20:02.970]  Daddy, I'm hungry.
[01:20:03.290 --> 01:20:04.471]  That little girl will get fed.
[01:20:04.811 --> 01:20:05.171]  For now.
[01:20:05.611 --> 01:20:08.333]  But what if people like Glenn Beck are right about the threats we face?
[01:20:08.733 --> 01:20:09.233]  If the U.S.
[01:20:09.273 --> 01:20:14.356]  dollar loses its status as the global reserve currency, prices on the things you need most will skyrocket.
[01:20:14.757 --> 01:20:17.098]  Food may be unaffordable, or worse, unavailable.
[01:20:17.498 --> 01:20:28.163]  Earthquakes, economic turmoil, continuing unemployment, rampant inflation, and even threats of terrorism are all reasons to let the experts at Ready Reserve Foods help you with a long-term food storage plan.
[01:20:28.463 --> 01:20:33.106]  Ready Reserve Foods has been a premier supplier of long-term storage foods for 37 years.
[01:20:33.546 --> 01:20:37.948]  Their unique process assures the highest quality long-term food storage available worldwide.
[01:20:38.148 --> 01:20:45.472]  Their products have a shelf life of 25 years, and a year's supply of quality food for two people only takes up about as much space as a refrigerator.
[01:20:45.672 --> 01:20:50.935]  For a fraction of what you now pay at the grocery store, you owe it to your family to find out more from Ready Reserve Foods.

[01:21:00.740 --> 01:21:03.222]  Going solar for cheap is as easy as 123.
[01:21:03.642 --> 01:21:08.905]  If you want to go solar but thought the setup costs were too high, now you can build your own solar panels for less than $200.
[01:21:09.766 --> 01:21:10.386]  Don't laugh!
[01:21:10.526 --> 01:21:13.268]  We've sold over 45,000 solar do-it-yourself kits.

[01:21:30.359 --> 01:21:31.420]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:35.983]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:21:36.163 --> 01:21:41.867]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:21:41.967 --> 01:21:45.369]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:21:45.609 --> 01:21:48.211]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:48.431 --> 01:21:53.234]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:21:53.374 --> 01:21:53.615]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:53.655 --> 01:21:55.016]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:00.639 --> 01:22:02.200]  America, you've been warned.
[01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:09.442]  For weeks, we've been warning you about a single event we believe will happen in the next 12 months that will shake the very foundations of our nation.
[01:22:09.622 --> 01:22:12.642]  We've told you about the video that details this shocking prediction.
[01:22:13.003 --> 01:22:16.423]  So far, over 6 million people have watched this free video online.
[01:22:16.664 --> 01:22:17.104]  Have you?
[01:22:17.484 --> 01:22:25.366]  Again, this big event has nothing to do with war or the stock market, yet it could change everything about your normal way of life, the way you shop, travel, invest,
[01:22:25.606 --> 01:22:26.027]  I don't know.
[01:22:40.763 --> 01:22:41.224]  I don't know.
[01:23:00.609 --> 01:23:03.630]  The largest part of gaining radiant health is detoxification.
[01:23:04.030 --> 01:23:11.353]  You can drink ionized water, cleanse your intestines, eat a perfect diet, and even take lots of quality supplements and in many instances only make minimal progress.
[01:23:11.873 --> 01:23:15.895]  What is the key to detoxifying your body of mercury, heavy metals, chemicals, and drugs?
[01:23:16.415 --> 01:23:17.456]  It is glutathione.
[01:23:17.856 --> 01:23:21.517]  Glutathione is the master antioxidant used to detoxify your entire body.
[01:23:21.917 --> 01:23:25.299]  It stops free radicals, keeps cells young, and reduces inflammation.
[01:23:25.919 --> 01:23:31.224]  One World Whey Protein Powder may be able to raise your glutathione production by 64% or more.
[01:23:31.704 --> 01:23:38.430]  One World Whey is more effective than any other whey protein powder on the market because it is unheated and from grass-fed cows.
[01:23:38.951 --> 01:23:43.815]  All other, quote, cold-processed whey protein powders have been heated and damaged by 15% or more.
[01:23:45.376 --> 01:23:47.438]  One World Whey comes in three delicious flavors.
[01:23:47.778 --> 01:23:48.038]  Call 888-988-3325.
[01:23:48.058 --> 01:23:48.379]  That's 888-988-3325.
[01:23:48.399 --> 01:23:49.620]  Or visit OneWorldWhey.com.
[01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:50.981]  That's One World W-H-E-Y dot com.
[01:24:13.725 --> 01:24:22.973]  Okay, your phone calls are coming up in the next segment on the new war with the NATO and UN announcing they're going to start bombing.
[01:24:23.313 --> 01:24:24.774]  That's called a no-fly zone now.
[01:24:25.555 --> 01:24:29.238]  Libya, we've got huge developments in the economy.
[01:24:29.258 --> 01:24:32.301]  We're going to be breaking down next hour with Bob Chapman.
[01:24:32.661 --> 01:24:36.745]  Dr. Nick Begich joins us now breaking down the unfolding disaster at Fukushima.
[01:24:37.405 --> 01:24:56.572]  Dr. Nick Begich, whenever I read this AP article, LA Times as well, radiation hampers efforts to restore power to nuclear plant in Japan, that they're having to pull back because the radiation is so high, but they won't tell us what the levels are in those two Japanese states, or prefectures, right in that area.
[01:24:56.972 --> 01:24:59.493]  I mean, that right there is a horrible sign, is it not?
[01:25:00.153 --> 01:25:00.894]  Yeah, it is.
[01:25:00.974 --> 01:25:06.676]  You know, in fact, the lack of information probably tells you a great deal right now.
[01:25:08.503 --> 01:25:08.843]  I think so.
[01:25:20.154 --> 01:25:44.240]  Industry is a big industry, and they have lobbied political bodies wherever these facilities exist to the point where, you know, they've rented a few politicians for long-term investments, and I think that's probably part of why we're not hearing so much either, is, you know, that's a very, very powerful political lobby, and the reality of that lobby, you know, are these kinds of risks.
[01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:47.161]  Now, the other side of that is, you know, and I'm really
[01:25:48.266 --> 01:25:57.174]  With you on energy resources, we have gas, oil, coal particularly, because there's some new technologies in that area.
[01:25:57.194 --> 01:26:00.276]  You know, coal alone could take the U.S.
[01:26:00.336 --> 01:26:02.979]  completely out of the energy import business.
[01:26:03.539 --> 01:26:13.068]  A technology that one of my colleagues just got back from the CTL, the Coal to Liquids Conference in Paris that took place here about a week and a half, two weeks ago.
[01:26:13.775 --> 01:26:39.834]  And, you know, at that conference, a U.S.-based company using somewhere just around a billion dollars of ExxonMobil-based research in two areas, one in CO2 suppression or recapture and the other in coal-to-liquids technology that actually yields, get this, 5.3 equivalent barrels of jet fuel
[01:26:40.647 --> 01:26:41.588]  I think?
[01:26:59.676 --> 01:27:13.320]  And it burns very clean, that's why the UN and the big bankers are on record, and the oil companies, trying to shut down gas, trying to shut down coal, because with the technologies, all that comes out is carbon dioxide and water vapor of the coal.
[01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:15.541]  Almost nothing comes out from the gas.
[01:27:15.881 --> 01:27:17.821]  That's why they're listing it as a toxic waste.
[01:27:17.881 --> 01:27:23.143]  Folks, do you want plutonium or uranium blowing up, or do you want some carbon dioxide?
[01:27:23.723 --> 01:27:24.523]  Well, here's the thing.
[01:27:24.583 --> 01:27:26.344]  This is what's really interesting.
[01:27:28.284 --> 01:27:28.945]  Thank you.
[01:27:41.655 --> 01:28:04.967]  The so-called pollutants being generated per unit of fuel, and you get the lowest sulfur content fuel in the world, and you get 20% more BTUs per unit, which means you can get 20% more range on a drone or predator or a jet aircraft, which changes the economics of air transport.
[01:28:05.561 --> 01:28:09.982]  And this technology works at about $50 a barrel oil.
[01:28:10.222 --> 01:28:32.766]  And so, and the excess here, now this is another bonus, is because it produces a large amount of heat in this catalytic process, because it's not a coal to gas to liquid, this is a coal with a chemical catalyst and temperature, and then you end up with 200 to 400 megawatts of excess electric power beyond what you need to run the facility.
[01:28:33.266 --> 01:28:46.055]  So it really produces a net, you can actually have a net negative, in other words, be consuming based on the design of these plants so that you don't produce any emissions and you actually net some out.
[01:28:46.635 --> 01:28:54.721]  But doctor, as you know, in our history, carbon dioxide has been 50, you know, 14 times just recently, higher than it is now.
[01:28:55.021 --> 01:28:58.043]  Many scientists believe the earth is actually carbon dioxide starved.
[01:28:58.483 --> 01:29:00.525]  I don't think carbon dioxide being released is bad.
[01:29:01.277 --> 01:29:03.018]  Well, and here's the thing about all of it.
[01:29:03.038 --> 01:29:09.119]  If you look at the carbon cycle over the planet and over its history, as you say, it has varied dramatically.
[01:29:09.559 --> 01:29:17.802]  And, you know, so has conditions on the planet varied over time, and that had very little, in fact nothing, to do with what man contributes to the process.
[01:29:18.142 --> 01:29:25.884]  But even if you buy into all the arguments, the fact of the matter is, even those guys have to accept coal as a viable alternative to what we're doing now.
[01:29:26.204 --> 01:29:27.245]  I've looked at everything.
[01:29:28.045 --> 01:29:32.748]  Clinton took off limits to clean burning coal in Utah, the biggest deposit in the world.
[01:29:32.768 --> 01:29:36.090]  He had companies he was connected to in China who had the second biggest.
[01:29:36.390 --> 01:29:38.631]  Their stocks doubled when that decision was made.
[01:29:38.651 --> 01:29:42.073]  You don't even need the scrubbers with that clean burning coal to the levels they have it.
[01:29:42.813 --> 01:29:43.894]  Coal is king.
[01:29:43.994 --> 01:29:45.875]  I've studied it all, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:29:46.335 --> 01:29:47.636]  Coal is what we need.
[01:29:47.776 --> 01:29:48.797]  Coal is king.
[01:29:50.938 --> 01:29:51.839]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.339 --> 01:29:53.840]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.861 --> 01:29:57.644]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.707 --> 01:30:02.309]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.

[01:30:52.904 --> 01:30:53.244]  Thank you!
[01:31:01.630 --> 01:31:05.254]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:31:05.654 --> 01:31:08.658]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:31:08.898 --> 01:31:13.683]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:31:13.703 --> 01:31:19.930]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:31:20.090 --> 01:31:22.333]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:31:22.853 --> 01:31:23.133]  Tim Geithner?
[01:31:23.153 --> 01:31:23.573]  Bernanke?
[01:31:23.673 --> 01:31:24.434]  They're arsonists!
[01:31:24.474 --> 01:31:25.594]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:31:25.614 --> 01:31:27.855]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:31:41.761 --> 01:31:48.669]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:31:49.049 --> 01:31:58.159]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:32:01.477 --> 01:32:08.159]  Alex has told you that the Mideast uprisings over food prices and shortages caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide.
[01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:10.740]  We're seeing the impact right here in the United States.
[01:32:11.180 --> 01:32:19.984]  Ethanol, that was supposed to reduce petroleum use and fuel prices, hit a 30-month high in February, and pump prices are expected to reach $5 a gallon.
[01:32:20.224 --> 01:32:28.126]  Because of shipping costs, food is being priced out of the reach of millions of Americans, with an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days.
[01:32:28.467 --> 01:32:29.787]  Move quickly while you can still
[01:32:29.787 --> 01:32:30.587]  We're good to go.
[01:33:02.833 --> 01:33:05.835]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:33:06.395 --> 01:33:10.598]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:10.978 --> 01:33:15.100]  Ladies and gentlemen, the cover-up has imploded.
[01:33:32.990 --> 01:33:46.018]  The director of the plant broke down and began to cry at a press conference and basically said they can no longer deceive the public, that the levels are deadly and can kill people.
[01:33:46.839 --> 01:33:48.520]  It is mainly blowing out the sea.
[01:33:49.020 --> 01:33:50.501]  Here's the devastating news.
[01:33:50.621 --> 01:33:56.645]  Japanese, US, Chinese and South Korean meteorologists, among some of the best in the world,
[01:33:57.870 --> 01:34:05.735]  Are giving a near certain chance with the meteorology that the winds will shift from straight east, due east towards the United States.
[01:34:07.190 --> 01:34:14.978]  Saturday and Sunday directly towards Tokyo in what is becoming obvious is a massive multi Chernobyl level meltdown.
[01:34:15.678 --> 01:34:16.659]  The Mail Online.
[01:34:16.839 --> 01:34:18.081]  It's all over Japanese news.
[01:34:18.121 --> 01:34:20.343]  I'm getting chills right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:20.583 --> 01:34:22.665]  37 million people in Tokyo, 150 miles south.
[01:34:23.146 --> 01:34:28.070]  Heavy winds and rain, which then dumps it on the public, headed Saturday and Sunday.
[01:34:28.391 --> 01:34:30.332]  The winds are still east but believed to shift
[01:34:31.033 --> 01:34:33.195]  In the meteorology reports towards Tokyo.
[01:34:33.215 --> 01:34:34.596]  That's on InfoWars.com.
[01:34:35.057 --> 01:34:36.858]  And Drudge Report has the article up as well.
[01:34:37.559 --> 01:34:48.889]  The moment the nuclear plant chief wept as Japanese finally admit the radiation leak is serious enough to kill people, and they've known this since Reactor 1 blew up Saturday.
[01:34:49.430 --> 01:34:52.513]  That radiation is set to hit the United States in the next 48 hours.
[01:34:53.959 --> 01:34:56.200]  Then, 24 hours after that, I just got chills again.
[01:34:56.780 --> 01:35:08.585]  Monday, the Mark 1 plutonium-uranium based reactor that when they developed in the 70s, massive amounts of GE nuclear physicist engineers resigned.
[01:35:08.605 --> 01:35:10.606]  And people won't remember that, so let's put it on screen.
[01:35:11.186 --> 01:35:13.807]  A General Electric scientist resigned over Mark 1 design.
[01:35:15.107 --> 01:35:21.630]  Not to mention the 640,000 plus fuel rods, hundreds of thousands of which were stored on top of the buildings that blew sky high.
[01:35:22.870 --> 01:35:23.831]  I'm getting chills right now.
[01:35:23.871 --> 01:35:42.287]  Dr. Begich, he has broken down, the boss of the company, we'll put it on screen, showing him crying, behind the devastating Japanese nuclear reactor today, broke down in tears as his country finally acknowledged the radiation spewing from the overheating reactors, that's called meltdown, and fuel rods was enough to kill some citizens.
[01:35:42.747 --> 01:35:48.332]  And we got calls from people that have friends in Japan that just got out of Japan saying folks are vomiting, red-faced.
[01:35:49.252 --> 01:35:50.453]  Uh, with radiation sickness.
[01:35:50.473 --> 01:35:54.757]  Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency admitted that the disaster was a level 5.
[01:35:55.257 --> 01:35:58.560]  They're saying that's the equivalent of Three Mile Island, but experts, even in L.A.
[01:35:58.580 --> 01:35:59.721]  Times, are saying that's a joke.
[01:35:59.781 --> 01:36:01.142]  It's worse than Chernobyl at 7.
[01:36:01.523 --> 01:36:05.366]  Which is classified as a crisis causing several radiation deaths by the U.N.
[01:36:05.666 --> 01:36:06.727]  International Atomic Energy.
[01:36:07.107 --> 01:36:10.910]  Officials said the rating was raised after they realized the full extent of the radiation leaking from the plant.
[01:36:11.291 --> 01:36:11.811]  They also said 3%
[01:36:13.132 --> 01:36:13.312]  I think?
[01:36:28.337 --> 01:36:32.900]  Cried as he left a conference to brief journalists on the situation at Fukushima.
[01:36:33.260 --> 01:36:40.185]  A senior Japanese minister also admitted that the country was overwhelmed by the scale of the tsunami and the nuclear crisis.
[01:36:40.565 --> 01:36:45.689]  He said officials should have admitted earlier how serious the radiation leaks were.
[01:36:46.209 --> 01:36:56.096]  Chief Cabinet Secretary then added, the unprecedented scale of the earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan, frankly speaking, were on many things that happened that have not anticipated under our disaster management.
[01:36:56.376 --> 01:36:57.857]  Really, tsunamis don't come with
[01:36:58.617 --> 01:36:59.958]  With earthquakes, they don't cause them.
[01:37:00.519 --> 01:37:01.320]  Earthquakes don't cause them.
[01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:13.690]  The Chief Cabinet Secretary added, in hindsight, we could have moved a little quicker in assessing the situation, they were too busy covering it up, and coordinating the information and providing it faster.
[01:37:13.730 --> 01:37:19.875]  Nuclear experts have been saying for days that Japan was underplaying the severity of the crisis.
[01:37:21.256 --> 01:37:23.959]  Going back to Dr. Nick Baggage.
[01:37:23.999 --> 01:37:25.200]  Baggage, what do you make of this?
[01:37:26.001 --> 01:37:29.824]  You know, that's just what we were saying before the story broke.
[01:37:29.864 --> 01:37:31.024]  You know, it was a meltdown.
[01:37:31.044 --> 01:37:36.668]  It is on a much larger scale, and it's going to continue to unfold that way.
[01:37:36.688 --> 01:37:45.314]  Now, the other part of this is, and I think we've done it before, we've had the conversation before, but we really need to look again
[01:37:46.132 --> 01:37:50.854]  That's sort of where we cited these things and how much risk they presently present.
[01:37:50.914 --> 01:38:02.299]  Because, you know, when you think about the United States and our vulnerabilities through the same kinds of natural disasters, both in the Midwestern states, because of the fault system there.
[01:38:02.339 --> 01:38:08.682]  Now, it's been a few hundred years since that one's broken loose, but the last... It's so powerful, the Mississippi changed course!
[01:38:09.153 --> 01:38:10.934]  Right, it went the other direction.
[01:38:11.134 --> 01:38:14.294]  And, you know, they could feel it all the way to Washington, D.C.
[01:38:14.314 --> 01:38:21.316]  You know, I mean, the thing about, you know, there's another seismic area in New York, goes right through New York City.
[01:38:22.117 --> 01:38:31.739]  Doctor, there's a giant fault line and three extinct volcanoes in Austin, and they actually built a huge experimental reactor on top the fault line in North Austin.
[01:38:32.339 --> 01:38:32.580]  Right.
[01:38:32.680 --> 01:38:37.341]  Now, and you look at Southern California and California and a number of facilities.
[01:38:38.283 --> 01:38:45.185]  When we start to really look at the risks, I mean, those are legitimate risks and risks that we also face in the United States.
[01:38:45.245 --> 01:38:46.366]  And we know why it happened.
[01:38:46.386 --> 01:38:48.266]  I want you to comment on this, and we're going to go into calls.
[01:38:48.847 --> 01:38:54.969]  When you get a huge $100 billion, $300 billion in the aggregate trillion dollar industry, they've got the lobbyists.
[01:38:55.289 --> 01:38:56.549]  Common sense people don't.
[01:38:56.849 --> 01:38:57.990]  They want to build these things.
[01:38:58.610 --> 01:39:00.733]  That's exactly right, and it is about that.
[01:39:00.753 --> 01:39:11.848]  You know, I'll tell you, coming from 50 years of experience in a political family, the reality is it has shifted that direction more so now.
[01:39:13.023 --> 01:39:16.727]  Than ever before, because it is lobbyists.
[01:39:16.747 --> 01:39:17.827]  I've been back to D.C.
[01:39:17.948 --> 01:39:23.452]  once to do some work back there and see my brother once since he's been elected the last two years.
[01:39:23.952 --> 01:39:34.121]  And my shock, you know, was I hadn't been there in maybe 15, 20 years, you know, in terms of just being there, but not on political business since my dad was in the Congress.
[01:39:34.779 --> 01:39:39.881]  And my shock was I walked into a building and we were headed to a lobbyist's office.
[01:39:39.941 --> 01:39:42.682]  We're walking in the building and I said, where's the office?
[01:39:42.862 --> 01:39:45.183]  And the guy says, you're standing in it.
[01:39:45.664 --> 01:39:50.786]  It was 16 floors and it was just one firm out of hundreds in D.C.
[01:39:51.526 --> 01:39:53.747]  and many dozens at least that size.
[01:39:53.787 --> 01:39:58.369]  And so I look around and I started recognizing the reality of D.C.
[01:39:58.429 --> 01:40:03.611]  is it's inaccessible unless you are a special interest to a large degree and that's why
[01:40:04.151 --> 01:40:10.135]  Whenever you have the opportunity to exercise, you know, any political speech, you should.
[01:40:10.235 --> 01:40:22.484]  Because these guys also still have to get elected, and until they finish hijacking the election process entirely, we really have to defend the Republic, in the sense of being
[01:40:24.264 --> 01:40:26.485]  Absolutely, Dr. Begich, expanding on that.
[01:40:27.165 --> 01:40:31.147]  The lobbyists come in and try to get government to mandate we must take dangerous vaccines.
[01:40:31.187 --> 01:40:34.868]  They come in and mandate that they're going to put their sodium fluoride toxic waste in our water.
[01:40:34.888 --> 01:40:37.449]  They come in and mandate that we're going to invade more countries.
[01:40:38.049 --> 01:40:41.790]  And the globalists are all competing with each other like a bunch of mad dogs.
[01:40:42.150 --> 01:40:43.811]  They're destroying their own self-interest.
[01:40:43.931 --> 01:40:49.973]  What is all these trillions of dollars worth if their own kids die of leukemia from the radiation?
[01:40:50.751 --> 01:40:58.376]  Well, again, if you look at it, there's a lot of reckless thinking and a lot of not thinking.
[01:40:58.696 --> 01:41:05.160]  People are motivated by all different things, and people's ability to assert on full knowledge is pretty limited.
[01:41:05.220 --> 01:41:10.843]  And greed in human nature, in a lot of cases, overrides good judgment more often than we'd like to believe.
[01:41:12.884 --> 01:41:14.765]  You know, that's how they keep score, you know?
[01:41:14.785 --> 01:41:16.225]  I mean, it's the bottom line.
[01:41:16.265 --> 01:41:19.926]  It doesn't have anything to do with national interests.
[01:41:19.946 --> 01:41:21.487]  These are multinational corporations.
[01:41:21.527 --> 01:41:28.089]  And so they look at the world as just a big marketplace with 7 billion people that might be consumers on some level.
[01:41:28.229 --> 01:41:36.711]  And when you look at the world and what's being developed in the world, you know, America's been abandoned on the basis that it's only 300 million people.
[01:41:37.212 --> 01:41:39.512]  They got billions trying to catch up.
[01:41:39.712 --> 01:41:41.173]  And that's why what you're seeing is
[01:41:41.693 --> 01:41:43.655]  Huge inflation in commodity prices.
[01:41:43.735 --> 01:41:46.537]  It still hasn't really registered to the American public.
[01:41:46.998 --> 01:41:56.445]  You see the downstream effects of bad judgment on technology deployment and lying to the public when they get caught early in the game.
[01:41:56.465 --> 01:41:58.987]  You know, I'm thinking about the tobacco industry in terms of what they hid.
[01:41:59.528 --> 01:42:10.517]  You have no clue what the collusion between the Atomic Energy Commission and everything that's come from it, you know, and in terms of what the industry has built,
[01:42:11.281 --> 01:42:12.042]  It is huge.
[01:42:12.542 --> 01:42:23.611]  And so consequently, always again, public health is at risk because of some corporate interests that were able to stretch the politician and the regulation.
[01:42:23.671 --> 01:42:27.534]  And that's fundamentally why you're seeing rebellion.
[01:42:27.594 --> 01:42:29.236]  It's just a different form of corruption.
[01:42:29.396 --> 01:42:31.818]  What's going on in the Middle East is rebellion against corruption.
[01:42:32.198 --> 01:42:33.019]  Well, what's the difference?
[01:42:33.279 --> 01:42:35.421]  We just institutionalized our corruption.
[01:42:35.661 --> 01:42:37.943]  Now we call a bribe a campaign contribution.
[01:42:37.963 --> 01:42:39.004]  Well, what's the difference?
[01:42:39.444 --> 01:42:47.228]  When it buys influence, outcomes, and access that you and I, as private citizens, can't get.
[01:42:47.248 --> 01:42:53.272]  That's a problem, and that is the root of the problem, quite frankly, is that equation.
[01:42:53.312 --> 01:42:59.555]  Because it takes the republic, it takes this democracy away from us, in that sense.
[01:42:59.895 --> 01:43:07.740]  And the representation aspect of how our democratic republic is set up is hijacked
[01:43:08.340 --> 01:43:13.442]  By soulless entities called corporations that have no political boundaries.
[01:43:13.882 --> 01:43:15.003]  That is a problem.
[01:43:15.023 --> 01:43:19.204]  They're driving too much political process in the process.
[01:43:19.584 --> 01:43:22.666]  And these are the kinds of outcomes when disaster hits.
[01:43:22.826 --> 01:43:24.106]  Oh, we didn't plan for this.
[01:43:24.146 --> 01:43:24.986]  Of course you didn't.
[01:43:25.567 --> 01:43:27.207]  Because you ignored the obvious.
[01:43:28.868 --> 01:43:31.749]  And then lobbied your way through the regulation and the controversy.
[01:43:34.226 --> 01:43:36.448]  Dr. Begich, I'm ready to go to phone calls.
[01:43:36.928 --> 01:43:41.252]  We're again very honored to have your expertise here looking at the wider issue.
[01:43:41.312 --> 01:43:49.159]  But before we go to calls in just about a minute or two, break down how from studying government, your dad being a powerful congressman, your brother being a U.S.
[01:43:49.199 --> 01:43:56.846]  Senator, you being a governmental leader in Alaska, studying how government operates, the Japanese seven days in admit it's all been a cover-up.
[01:43:57.706 --> 01:43:58.727]  It's much worse than they said.
[01:43:58.767 --> 01:44:00.928]  The meltdowns are going on at multiple reactors.
[01:44:01.388 --> 01:44:05.731]  That was going on admittedly Monday, but now they admit people are dying, that it is killing people.
[01:44:06.111 --> 01:44:17.598]  How do you expect from studying Chernobyl, that put out high levels of radiation 3,000 miles away, of when the radiation intensifies in the next few days, how they're going to try to cover this up, and how do we counter that?
[01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:25.906]  Well, there are independent people with access to rad detectors and what would be really useful.
[01:44:26.386 --> 01:44:36.854]  We used to carry one and we sold a bunch of them around the country and if there's anyone that has one, right now they're back ordering them like two, three weeks with the supplier we used to work with.
[01:44:36.994 --> 01:44:40.977]  But these instruments exist in universities, exist
[01:44:41.557 --> 01:44:42.358]  Uh, all around.
[01:44:42.659 --> 01:44:57.717]  And I would say that's one of the things that citizens can do is start monitoring with reliable equipment, the background radiation, and start reporting it into maybe a central location so it can be mapped and charted and kept track of.
[01:44:57.737 --> 01:44:59.399]  And there's no one doing that independently.
[01:44:59.419 --> 01:45:00.240]  It would be an excellent...
[01:45:00.920 --> 01:45:01.361]  I don't know.
[01:45:21.061 --> 01:45:22.382]  You know, we're doing spot checks.
[01:45:22.502 --> 01:45:23.922]  Everything's got radiation in it.
[01:45:24.243 --> 01:45:32.066]  Even though it's moderate to low, when you get multiple exposures, it can bioaccumulate, as you said, in the food chain to high in humans.
[01:45:32.406 --> 01:45:43.292]  We know the effects of radiation are many times worse for fast-growing cells in young humans, but all other growing mammals and animals, insects, you name it.
[01:45:43.712 --> 01:45:46.313]  I don't see our government doing what Europe did.
[01:45:46.333 --> 01:45:47.774]  They'll just say, eat the food.
[01:45:48.604 --> 01:45:48.824]  Right.
[01:45:48.884 --> 01:45:56.070]  You know, I mean, think about the whole story, the terrorism story about a dirty bomb, a dirty bomb.
[01:45:56.090 --> 01:46:02.655]  Well, we just witnessed a dirty bomb, you know, and Mother Nature just ignited it, you know, and people weren't ready for it.
[01:46:02.715 --> 01:46:06.318]  But that's, in fact, what we have here on a much bigger scale.
[01:46:07.058 --> 01:46:10.482]  Uh, than anything contemplated that a terrorist could have pulled off.
[01:46:10.603 --> 01:46:21.556]  So, you know, if you want to put things in perspective, remember all the stories and government lying on terrorists and dirty bombs you carry in a suitcase.
[01:46:21.576 --> 01:46:24.459]  Well, this suitcase was the size of a couple of buildings.
[01:46:25.180 --> 01:46:25.841]  I mean, you look at...
[01:46:26.281 --> 01:46:29.786]  Four big buildings sitting there in some stage of meltdown.
[01:46:44.525 --> 01:46:45.726]  Very deceptive by them.
[01:46:45.806 --> 01:46:50.129]  Last question, I promise we're going to Ryan, Tony, Will, Jennifer and Mike, but I've got to ask you this.
[01:46:50.609 --> 01:46:58.515]  My phone's rung off the hook, emails, I know you've gotten it, saying this had to be HAARP, that I'm covering it up because I'm not talking about HAARP.
[01:46:59.756 --> 01:47:13.302]  I've had Pierce Corbin, the top astrophysicist who has an 85%, even mainstream news says, year-out extreme weather forecast, because he goes off the sun, electromagnetic, and the moon blocking that, and the tides.
[01:47:13.762 --> 01:47:25.987]  He says that the moon, we had the closest moon in 18 years, they call it the giant moon, pulling the magma, not just the tides, with a huge solar flare that hit six hours before this massive earthquake.
[01:47:26.347 --> 01:47:27.448]  He's saying, no doubt,
[01:47:27.748 --> 01:47:28.569]  That that's what did it.
[01:47:28.649 --> 01:47:29.871]  That's Mother Nature's harp.
[01:47:30.792 --> 01:47:35.077]  Yeah, you know, actually, that's those are, in fact, really good observations.
[01:47:35.097 --> 01:47:44.488]  And you can add into that the resonance effect of the planets when they line up on the other side of the sun, which is also happening right now and will continue for the next few weeks.
[01:47:44.528 --> 01:47:45.969]  This sort of orientation, I think.
[01:47:47.794 --> 01:47:54.678]  The odds are, here's something to think about, the odds are we're going to see some more of this in other places on the Ring of Fire.
[01:47:54.798 --> 01:48:04.302]  And the most vulnerable places where the plates are locked are the northwestern portion of the United States where you have a huge fault zone.
[01:48:04.982 --> 01:48:05.382]  I think?
[01:48:20.569 --> 01:48:22.410]  By the way, sir, this is not hokey.
[01:48:22.830 --> 01:48:29.433]  Even ABC News, two weeks before, said a lot of astrophysicists were predicting megaquakes.
[01:48:29.493 --> 01:48:37.516]  The truth is, the UN and others love to say the sun has no effect on climate, which is like, you know, saying water has no effect on fish.
[01:48:37.816 --> 01:48:41.998]  The truth is, real scientists know it's the moon and the sun that are the chief drivers.
[01:48:42.578 --> 01:48:50.141]  Right, and you're talking about, I mean, think about, we have 22-foot tidal height differences here in my part of the world.
[01:48:50.992 --> 01:48:56.094]  That's pretty extreme when you think about how much the Earth and how much material is being moved.
[01:48:56.875 --> 01:49:07.980]  And you know, I mean, those solar cycles and gravitational cycles, the word lunatic comes from lunar because of that lunar cycle that people recognized long ago.
[01:49:08.040 --> 01:49:11.742]  Well, think about 90% water in the brain and 70% in the body.
[01:49:12.182 --> 01:49:19.345]  And yeah, you're going to be affected on a very fundamental electromagnetic level, you know, in terms of gravitational fields.
[01:49:19.685 --> 01:49:23.949]  Well, wildlife goes crazy during full moons, even if it's overcast.
[01:49:23.989 --> 01:49:27.172]  Scientists have shown it's not the light of the moon that's doing it.
[01:49:27.652 --> 01:49:30.595]  I mean, I remember being a teenager running around under a full moon.
[01:49:30.635 --> 01:49:31.916]  You feel energized.
[01:49:32.457 --> 01:49:32.657]  Right.
[01:49:32.997 --> 01:49:41.105]  Now the harp issue, now that's important to recognize because harp was designed to do things that nature does.
[01:49:41.625 --> 01:49:41.825]  Okay.
[01:49:54.161 --> 01:49:55.862]  The natural magnetic field line.
[01:49:55.982 --> 01:49:56.783]  Amplification.
[01:49:57.323 --> 01:49:57.604]  Right.
[01:49:57.644 --> 01:50:06.651]  You're basically tapping into energy that's already there or triggering energy like triggering a volcanic eruption or say a fault slip where energy is built up.
[01:50:06.771 --> 01:50:13.996]  You can resonate energy in at a very subtle level but builds up to the point where that energy gets released or an earthquake occurs.
[01:50:14.457 --> 01:50:18.820]  And this is the thing that happens every time there's a major earthquake.
[01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:23.524]  I don't care whether it's Haiti, Japan, the tsunami that hit
[01:50:24.805 --> 01:50:41.428]  uh... thailand and and indonesia uh... you know that all of them but we have people who hit us all the time to say it's hard it's hard well there's no independent monitoring which is the first problem uh... that i'm aware of that can confirm that by defining which signals are responsible for those events.
[01:50:41.568 --> 01:50:45.549]  Alright, Dr. Begich, this is really important information but we've got to go to calls.
[01:50:45.869 --> 01:50:50.030]  I want to keep you five minutes into the next hour with us so we can at least get to these calls but finish your point.
[01:50:50.711 --> 01:51:01.558]  Well, and the point is, don't jump to that conclusion, but the important point is, man can do this today, and that is important, because it's the same kind of bad policy that leads to nuclear meltdowns.
[01:51:01.578 --> 01:51:05.400]  And I think that's the real point on advanced technologies.
[01:51:05.481 --> 01:51:08.142]  Move slow if we move at all in some directions.
[01:51:08.623 --> 01:51:10.264]  Because this could trigger something.
[01:51:10.984 --> 01:51:12.725]  They don't fully control what they're doing.
[01:51:12.745 --> 01:51:15.147]  It could cause an even bigger cataclysm.
[01:51:15.467 --> 01:51:18.289]  Ryan in Seattle, thank you for holding her on the air with Dr. Nick Begich.
[01:51:19.068 --> 01:51:22.350]  Hey, thanks guys, I really appreciate both your guys' work.
[01:51:23.531 --> 01:51:32.657]  Speaking of Fox, you mentioned Fox earlier, Alex, and, you know, I'm just totally, I'm upset with them anyways, but, I mean, they totally, Shepard Smith really made me mad the other day.
[01:51:32.697 --> 01:51:34.558]  He's been, I heard him call people dumb.
[01:51:34.618 --> 01:51:38.661]  Don't be dumb, and, you know, potassium iodide.
[01:51:39.221 --> 01:51:41.022]  You know, it's just these mind tricks.
[01:51:41.222 --> 01:51:43.764]  They don't want you to learn to be self-sufficient.
[01:51:44.204 --> 01:51:46.446]  It's bad to ever respond to a threat.
[01:51:47.611 --> 01:51:48.432]  Right, exactly.
[01:51:48.472 --> 01:51:52.915]  It's like, I just want to reach through the TV and slap them.
[01:51:53.055 --> 01:52:00.461]  Every time I watch Fox, they show Fukushima video of it undamaged, and do not tell people that it's months old.
[01:52:01.522 --> 01:52:02.082]  Exactly.
[01:52:02.502 --> 01:52:13.270]  And you know, about HAARP, I mean, I guess it is a possibility for them to do that, and then in the midst of it, the UN passes a deal to no-fly zone over Libya.
[01:52:13.290 --> 01:52:15.232]  You know, it all seems like it would go together.
[01:52:17.023 --> 01:52:17.823]  I truly believe it.
[01:52:18.603 --> 01:52:19.224]  Here's the deal.
[01:52:19.344 --> 01:52:23.926]  Look at the ancients, all the earthquakes and cataclysms they had, and it wasn't hard then.
[01:52:24.326 --> 01:52:29.609]  We are living on floating islands of rock on top of molten lava.
[01:52:29.689 --> 01:52:30.830]  I appreciate your call.
[01:52:31.050 --> 01:52:31.930]  Correct, Dr. Baggage?
[01:52:32.631 --> 01:52:33.211]  That is true.
[01:52:35.307 --> 01:52:51.212]  You know, the old models for geology were that it moved slowly and gradually over millions of years, and certain processes do indeed do that, but others are very quick, sudden, and cataclysmic, as we just saw.
[01:52:52.632 --> 01:53:06.425]  The biggest ones the planet has seen that you know they can look at the record along coastlines and look at where there were tidal waves and where these events occurred over hundreds and even thousands of years and we have not seen anything compared to what the earth is possible.
[01:53:06.445 --> 01:53:11.490]  Well that's why till Shoemaker-Levy hit Saturn they believe it was every million years or so that a big asteroid hit.
[01:53:11.830 --> 01:53:13.171]  Now they admit it could be every 10,000.
[01:53:15.433 --> 01:53:20.197]  Just off of now what they've watched in the solar system, there's stuff slamming into planets continually.
[01:53:20.738 --> 01:53:23.500]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tony in Michigan.
[01:53:23.520 --> 01:53:24.321]  You're on the air, Tony.
[01:53:25.222 --> 01:53:28.324]  Hi guys, thanks for the opportunity to talk to you.
[01:53:28.965 --> 01:53:35.610]  I'm calling about an anomaly, a possible anomaly, I noticed in the first explosion at the number one plant there in Fukushima.
[01:53:35.630 --> 01:53:47.599]  But Alex, I want your staff to go back to Obama's press conference last Friday, I believe, early in the afternoon, where he briefly mentioned Japan, and then went into something about gas prices.
[01:53:47.639 --> 01:53:50.040]  There's a sound bite in there you've got to get for your film.
[01:53:50.120 --> 01:53:51.581]  No, he barely talks about it!
[01:53:52.362 --> 01:53:53.263]  It's insane!
[01:53:53.942 --> 01:53:57.927]  Well, he actually said in his press conference that the American people are in a trance.
[01:53:58.707 --> 01:53:59.328]  Quoted him.
[01:53:59.388 --> 01:54:05.675]  He said that when the gas prices a few years ago went up above $4, the American people got upset.
[01:54:06.016 --> 01:54:09.259]  This is, I'm paraphrasing now because I don't have the transcript.
[01:54:09.580 --> 01:54:12.103]  He said, but then they slipped right back into their trance.
[01:54:13.144 --> 01:54:15.006]  And that's a sound bite that needs to
[01:54:15.086 --> 01:54:22.472]  Well, they know with television that people medically, this is a fact, are in a trance who watch a lot of TV, not just when they're watching it.
[01:54:22.512 --> 01:54:31.480]  But guys, try to go to YouTube and type in Obama's statement on Japan from last Friday, because I do remember that.
[01:54:32.080 --> 01:54:33.582]  Where was he when he gave that speech?
[01:54:34.546 --> 01:54:41.550]  I'm not sure where he was, but it was early in the afternoon, and right after he mentioned Japan, he started talking about gas prices.
[01:54:41.630 --> 01:54:55.857]  Yeah, search Obama's statement on Japan, March 11th, and then we can find that video, or you can type Obama comments on gas prices on YouTube, type it in the search in the last week.
[01:54:56.397 --> 01:54:58.439]  He has selections for searching, and we'll find that.
[01:54:58.919 --> 01:55:00.420]  Good point, Tony, we'll look that up.
[01:55:01.021 --> 01:55:05.425]  He even called the NCAA picks two days ago a good diversion for America.
[01:55:05.665 --> 01:55:07.947]  They really throw this in our face, don't they, Dr. Begich?
[01:55:08.567 --> 01:55:17.835]  Yeah, you know, again, it's this whole, just the whole way in which things are flowing right now, and at the same time, how information is restricted.
[01:55:19.393 --> 01:55:21.254]  These are the big concerns I've got.
[01:55:21.274 --> 01:55:26.015]  The fact that we can't see in the open media a clear, really independent media.
[01:55:26.075 --> 01:55:31.196]  They're all just sort of weighing the press releases and giving what I call the neutered news.
[01:55:31.996 --> 01:55:38.918]  It's news without any form or any deep research and it's talking head-on on the television and reporting.
[01:55:39.537 --> 01:55:42.398]  You know, I consider what you do and what I do is reporting the news.
[01:55:42.518 --> 01:55:53.020]  You know, trying to find the facts and get them in front of the public in a way that we can at least have the knowledge to start reacting to in a different way than being herded along.
[01:55:53.140 --> 01:55:53.780]  Absolutely.
[01:55:53.900 --> 01:55:55.480]  Doctor, I've got to interrupt again.
[01:55:55.500 --> 01:55:56.821]  I've got to let Tony go.
[01:55:56.841 --> 01:56:00.741]  We just got Dom from Japan calling us from Japan.
[01:56:00.821 --> 01:56:02.302]  Dom, you're on the air with Dr. Begich.
[01:56:02.322 --> 01:56:02.722]  Go ahead.
[01:56:04.162 --> 01:56:04.682]  Oh, hello.
[01:56:05.202 --> 01:56:07.663]  Actually, my question is for you, Alex.
[01:56:09.361 --> 01:56:11.522]  I'm living in Chiba, Japan.
[01:56:11.542 --> 01:56:12.222]  Do you know where that is?
[01:56:13.403 --> 01:56:14.424]  No, sir.
[01:56:14.504 --> 01:56:17.885]  Tell us what area.
[01:56:18.005 --> 01:56:21.927]  That's 133 miles south of Sendai in Fukushima.
[01:56:22.508 --> 01:56:23.888]  Yeah, the winds are going to change.
[01:56:23.928 --> 01:56:26.209]  They now admit it's deadly levels of radiation.
[01:56:26.570 --> 01:56:29.511]  The meteorologists predict that it's going to turn towards you.
[01:56:29.731 --> 01:56:34.393]  I would, if I was you before everybody else figures this out, if you can do it, I would get out of Japan.
[01:56:34.433 --> 01:56:35.354]  Dr. Begich, what would you do?
[01:56:36.107 --> 01:56:37.188]  Well, I think so.
[01:56:37.228 --> 01:56:42.092]  In fact, the United States, as I understand it today, is suggesting that citizens, U.S.
[01:56:42.112 --> 01:56:44.293]  citizens, leave Japan and return to the U.S.
[01:56:44.374 --> 01:56:46.135]  And that's another indicator.
[01:56:46.155 --> 01:56:55.462]  You know, without creating a panic rush to the airport, it's again that kind of subtle warning in advance to more information.
[01:56:55.482 --> 01:56:56.663]  And that's always the way it goes.
[01:56:56.683 --> 01:56:59.726]  You know, get your diplomats out, get your families out, and then get everyone else out.
[01:56:59.886 --> 01:57:01.547]  And Dom, I jumped to conclusions there.
[01:57:01.587 --> 01:57:02.368]  Was that your question?
[01:57:04.093 --> 01:57:06.795]  Well, that was one big question.
[01:57:06.815 --> 01:57:09.317]  I wanted to know what the exact levels were.
[01:57:10.177 --> 01:57:15.581]  And I also wanted just to thank you for your good work, now that I have the opportunity on the line.
[01:57:15.641 --> 01:57:29.551]  I'm actually a member of Scholars for 9-1-1 Truth and Justice, and I know all the hard work that you're doing, and Dr. Bowman, and Ray McGovern, and I can name a bunch of other people, and I know they're working really hard, and I appreciate that.
[01:57:32.219 --> 01:57:33.400]  Uh, stay there, Dom.
[01:57:33.420 --> 01:57:34.341]  I want to talk to you more.
[01:57:34.381 --> 01:57:36.063]  Dr. Baggett's comments on what he just said.
[01:57:36.083 --> 01:57:44.011]  No, I think it's all, uh, you know, important stuff, and, you know, there's got to be a consular office somewhere close by to catch him, and they're going to tell you.
[01:57:44.111 --> 01:57:46.073]  It's time to maybe consider coming back.
[01:57:48.315 --> 01:57:48.635]  Yeah.
[01:57:50.998 --> 01:57:51.999]  I appreciate that advice.
[01:57:54.763 --> 01:58:09.535]  Sir, anything else, Dom from Japan, anything else that you can tell us about what you're seeing in Japan, the announcements now by the head of Tokyo Power and Electric, the head of the plant, that it was basically a cover-up and that it is very deadly and breaking down crying?
[01:58:13.260 --> 01:58:19.584]  You don't get a whole lot of news like I've been kind of looking on the internet and you don't get really a lot there.
[01:58:20.524 --> 01:58:25.227]  That's kind of why I called you because I've been watching your show for a long time.
[01:58:25.327 --> 01:58:26.688]  I check the things you say.
[01:58:26.748 --> 01:58:32.232]  I know that you tell the truth and I wanted to see what you had to say about it.
[01:58:34.953 --> 01:58:39.216]  For the last few days there's been like little shakes going on which is kind of weird.
[01:58:42.244 --> 01:58:44.205]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.665 --> 01:58:47.846]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.647 --> 01:58:51.787]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:58:51.827 --> 01:58:58.489]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:58:58.750 --> 01:59:01.050]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:59:01.310 --> 01:59:06.512]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:59:06.692 --> 01:59:09.473]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:59:09.733 --> 01:59:11.794]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:59:12.034 --> 01:59:17.978]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:59:18.279 --> 01:59:21.501]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:59:21.661 --> 01:59:27.205]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:59:27.445 --> 01:59:28.766]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:59:29.086 --> 01:59:30.267]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:59:30.387 --> 01:59:32.949]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:59:33.069 --> 01:59:37.112]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:59:37.292 --> 01:59:39.314]  You can find the video at www.
[01:59:40.074 --> 01:59:41.775]  End of America 3.com.
[01:59:41.896 --> 01:59:44.357]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[01:59:53.545 --> 01:59:55.466]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:55.946 --> 01:59:58.729]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.287 --> 02:00:09.473]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.134 --> 02:00:10.915]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.716 --> 02:00:12.638]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.258 --> 02:00:16.924]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.445 --> 02:00:21.510]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.329 --> 02:00:26.811]  Folks, I'm not going to hide this from listeners, okay?
[02:00:27.071 --> 02:00:38.680]  If you hear chirping in the background or you hear a guest talking and it sounds like I'm breaking in and not listening when they stop talking, it's routine for me to be on the phone in here directing things or on the back channel during emergencies.
[02:00:39.381 --> 02:00:48.107]  I'm here on the radio right now talking to the office 30, 40 yards away trying to keep InfoWars.com up because of a top drudge link.
[02:00:48.988 --> 02:00:52.571]  I don't like to do the bad computer etiquette of bouncing at the prison planet.
[02:00:53.351 --> 02:00:57.654]  It's the ad servers and things on InfoWars that do this, but there's denials about that.
[02:00:57.714 --> 02:01:01.176]  But the point is that I can see that it's the ad server doing it right there.
[02:01:01.196 --> 02:01:02.257]  It's the first thing that hangs.
[02:01:03.438 --> 02:01:04.519]  John Harmon is up there.
[02:01:04.559 --> 02:01:06.620]  We're trying to keep InfoWars up.
[02:01:07.781 --> 02:01:11.723]  I'm going to make a decision on this in the next five minutes if we're going to bounce to Prison Planet.
[02:01:11.743 --> 02:01:14.485]  If Matt Drudge is listening, I know you like to link to InfoWars.
[02:01:14.505 --> 02:01:15.746]  We end up bouncing to Prison Planet.
[02:01:16.106 --> 02:01:19.669]  We just can't handle the bandwidth here, but I haven't made the decision yet.
[02:01:20.289 --> 02:01:22.591]  And again, I'm giving directives to the guys in the other office.
[02:01:23.991 --> 02:01:27.093]  People get to see some behind-the-scenes here now, the trap of craziness that goes on.
[02:01:27.993 --> 02:01:30.674]  But turn off comments on all of InfoWars.
[02:01:31.395 --> 02:01:36.177]  Is there a way to freeze that through Varnish, through the CDNs?
[02:01:36.637 --> 02:01:42.720]  I don't respond back because I'm going back live on air, but that's my statement to you so that you'll have answers for me in four minutes when we go back to break.
[02:01:43.380 --> 02:01:51.324]  Dr. Nick Begich, continuing here with the caller in Japan, Dom, do you have any questions for Dom in Japan?
[02:01:52.293 --> 02:01:56.836]  Just I would expect you're going to continue to get tremors as things stabilize.
[02:01:56.876 --> 02:02:01.078]  I mean, it's probably the frequency has dropped probably dramatically from that first couple of days.
[02:02:01.178 --> 02:02:03.139]  But, you know, those are still happening.
[02:02:03.179 --> 02:02:10.023]  And as people do clean up and are organizing what they're doing, they need to be and are, I know, cognizant of all that.
[02:02:11.403 --> 02:02:20.348]  I was just going to say there are little tremors even here in Chiba.
[02:02:20.368 --> 02:02:21.509]  I mean, not, you know,
[02:02:22.806 --> 02:02:26.656]  133 miles away and you know you can really feel it here in the apartment.
[02:02:28.260 --> 02:02:29.621]  So it's shake, rattle, and roll.
[02:02:29.821 --> 02:02:33.443]  There have been hundreds of aftershocks, some as high as a seven.
[02:02:33.503 --> 02:02:34.444]  Correct, Dr. Begich?
[02:02:34.704 --> 02:02:35.364]  Right, right.
[02:02:35.424 --> 02:02:36.085]  Exactly right.
[02:02:36.105 --> 02:02:51.434]  You know, and the thing about a lot of these quakes that they, you know, we have, we've had sevens here in the last 10 years, but they're in such remote areas and there's no one with anything over a story or two, so you don't get this kind of devastation.
[02:02:51.454 --> 02:02:53.596]  A lot of them have been inland, so you're not getting the tidal
[02:02:54.496 --> 02:03:12.429]  Issues either but you know again you look at the plate system for Alaska and the West Coast and you get the dynamic of what's going on here as the Pacific plate gets shoved up underneath North America and you know that's what creates earthquakes is fault lines and they go through cycles.
[02:03:12.449 --> 02:03:18.773]  You know one of the other factors that contributes to some degree we don't really understand it is it a symptom or the cause but
[02:03:19.233 --> 02:03:23.034]  The magnetic field lines are shifting around quite a bit.
[02:03:23.054 --> 02:03:27.876]  This happens about every 600-700,000 years, that particular cycle.
[02:03:28.736 --> 02:03:30.837]  And at this time, it's actually accelerating.
[02:03:30.877 --> 02:03:37.359]  The magnetic North Pole is actually moving towards the former Soviet Union, now Russia.
[02:03:37.839 --> 02:03:41.021]  At an accelerating rate, you know, since they've been monitoring this activity.
[02:03:41.061 --> 02:03:48.685]  But all those things indicate a whole lot happening within the Earth at a particular juncture in time.
[02:03:48.725 --> 02:03:49.625]  And we're in the middle of it.
[02:03:49.645 --> 02:03:51.086]  We're going to see a lot more of this.
[02:03:51.106 --> 02:03:57.109]  You know, back in the 90s, we were predicting increases in climate and weather issues.
[02:03:57.669 --> 02:04:02.773]  Not so much because of technology, but because of what was happening in the normal cycles.
[02:04:02.814 --> 02:04:13.923]  And our concern was, man's technology now is that proverbial straw on the camel's back that throws things even further out of their equilibrium, and it's already happening.
[02:04:13.983 --> 02:04:15.364]  We don't need to be doing that.
[02:04:15.724 --> 02:04:17.906]  We need to be learning, but we don't need to be doing it that way.
[02:04:20.948 --> 02:04:25.193]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, the great IT team at StabilizedInfoWars.com for now.
[02:04:25.714 --> 02:04:28.097]  We're going to let Dr. Nick Begich go.
[02:04:28.157 --> 02:04:33.303]  It's been a feverish interview covering a lot of different subjects as we banter back and forth, integrating the information.
[02:04:33.804 --> 02:04:38.610]  Dr. Nick Begich, thank you so much for joining us and continue your wonderful work.
[02:04:38.650 --> 02:04:40.332]  What's the best website for folks to visit?
[02:04:40.885 --> 02:04:42.927]  Well, check out EarthPulse.com.
[02:04:42.967 --> 02:04:44.789]  E-A-R-T-H-P-U-L-S-E.
[02:04:44.929 --> 02:04:45.910]  EarthPulse.com.
[02:04:45.970 --> 02:04:52.337]  And we're linked, of course, to your site in terms of our products and support Alex's work.
[02:04:52.477 --> 02:04:53.338]  I mean, that's the way you do it.
[02:04:53.438 --> 02:04:54.139]  Yeah, God bless you.
[02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:56.461]  We do provide all your books and videos.
[02:04:56.481 --> 02:04:56.962]  They're amazing.
[02:04:57.002 --> 02:04:57.963]  Thank you, Dr. Nick Begich.
[02:05:00.666 --> 02:05:04.589]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:05:04.829 --> 02:05:10.874]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:05:11.234 --> 02:05:18.340]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:05:18.640 --> 02:05:23.184]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[02:05:23.504 --> 02:05:31.997]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[02:05:32.157 --> 02:05:35.903]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[02:05:36.420 --> 02:05:42.605]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[02:05:43.186 --> 02:05:46.609]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[02:05:47.089 --> 02:05:53.354]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying a 1 to 2 month soap sampler.
[02:05:53.454 --> 02:05:54.235]  Thank you.
[02:06:01.274 --> 02:06:15.746]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[02:06:16.747 --> 02:06:20.430]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:06:21.434 --> 02:06:33.443]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:06:34.204 --> 02:06:41.470]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[02:06:42.150 --> 02:06:51.760]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[02:06:52.521 --> 02:06:55.805]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[02:06:56.465 --> 02:06:59.569]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:07:00.089 --> 02:07:04.330]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:07:04.630 --> 02:07:05.251]  Number one.
[02:07:05.551 --> 02:07:08.712]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:07:08.972 --> 02:07:09.552]  Number two.
[02:07:09.832 --> 02:07:14.394]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:07:14.734 --> 02:07:15.174]  It's true.
[02:07:15.474 --> 02:07:20.035]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:07:20.335 --> 02:07:20.896]  Number three.
[02:07:21.156 --> 02:07:24.457]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:07:24.757 --> 02:07:28.438]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:07:28.658 --> 02:07:29.198]  Number 4.
[02:07:29.459 --> 02:07:31.820]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:07:32.221 --> 02:07:35.583]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:07:35.904 --> 02:07:36.104]  Number 5.
[02:07:36.684 --> 02:07:40.607]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:07:40.827 --> 02:07:45.591]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:07:45.891 --> 02:07:49.915]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:50.056 --> 02:07:51.597]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:51.838 --> 02:07:53.920]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[02:07:56.703 --> 02:08:06.634]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:14.997 --> 02:08:16.798]  We've got Dom in Japan.
[02:08:17.458 --> 02:08:21.120]  We've got Will, Jennifer, Mike, and many others holding the toll-free number to join us.
[02:08:21.480 --> 02:08:22.940]  We're taking a lot of calls in this hour.
[02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:24.001]  It's 800-259-9231.
[02:08:24.081 --> 02:08:33.205]  First, I want to get Bob Chapman, who joined us last Friday, as he does every Friday, when the disaster was unfolding, that first radiation leak.
[02:08:33.965 --> 02:08:34.906]  That was whitewashed.
[02:08:35.106 --> 02:08:40.490]  Friday has now reached the West Coast, as of this morning in Los Angeles, but it's low radiation.
[02:08:40.951 --> 02:08:46.275]  The issue is, unfortunately, but it's prepare for the worst, you know, hope for the best, prepare for the worst.
[02:08:47.035 --> 02:08:52.480]  The big blowouts happened Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, right through to today.
[02:08:52.980 --> 02:08:57.664]  The Japanese head of the plant has broken down and cried and said, we're not going to cover this up anymore.
[02:08:57.984 --> 02:08:58.925]  This is going to kill people.
[02:08:58.965 --> 02:09:00.145]  This is deadly radiation.
[02:09:01.066 --> 02:09:02.727]  It's blowing out towards us right now.
[02:09:03.387 --> 02:09:04.748]  Undoubtedly, it's out of control.
[02:09:05.048 --> 02:09:07.309]  Partial meltdowns have been going on since last Saturday.
[02:09:07.329 --> 02:09:11.351]  600,000 spent fuel rods stored on top of the facilities, blown sky high.
[02:09:11.811 --> 02:09:14.593]  Then, big new developments on the issue with Libya.
[02:09:15.013 --> 02:09:16.294]  Well, we're busy watching this.
[02:09:17.358 --> 02:09:35.549]  in the pacific with japan the radiation cloud now the first fingers of it uh... delicately touching the west coast and with the big punch behind it are multiple big punches behind it undoubtedly the low radiation of friday got here can you imagine uh... meanwhile obama's running around saying you don't need potassium iodide
[02:09:36.429 --> 02:09:40.271]  Bizarre statements from Ann Coulter with a headline, a glowing report on radiation.
[02:09:40.992 --> 02:09:46.835]  She said anyone exposed to excess radiation from the nuclear power plant is now probably much less likely to get cancer.
[02:09:47.075 --> 02:09:48.416]  This is not a satire piece.
[02:09:48.756 --> 02:09:51.237]  This is all part of their arrogance throwing it in our face.
[02:09:51.577 --> 02:09:53.738]  Obama's going to Brazil for a week.
[02:09:54.239 --> 02:09:55.299]  One day of it is work.
[02:09:56.020 --> 02:09:58.961]  Hanging out with the NCAA basketball picks for hours.
[02:09:59.441 --> 02:10:01.743]  One brief statement last Friday.
[02:10:02.783 --> 02:10:03.744]  Uh, about Japan.
[02:10:03.804 --> 02:10:10.208]  Another brief statement yesterday, sandwiched in with other bizarre statements, um, about basketball and things.
[02:10:10.228 --> 02:10:12.249]  Uh, this is being done by design.
[02:10:12.269 --> 02:10:14.330]  Uh, you're not going to see what happened with Chernobyl.
[02:10:14.370 --> 02:10:20.534]  This has clearly eclipsed that, where they didn't let people for six months at least eat food produced in Europe because it was radiated.
[02:10:21.474 --> 02:10:23.276]  You're just gonna be told everything's fine.
[02:10:23.296 --> 02:10:27.118]  Uh, we're gonna talk about that with Bob Chapman and the huge new developments, Libya.
[02:10:28.837 --> 02:10:31.759]  Yesterday, as you know, 10 to 0 with five abstentions.
[02:10:32.399 --> 02:10:33.920]  Russia, China and others just didn't vote.
[02:10:33.940 --> 02:10:37.923]  They sat on the bench, which is basically a yay vote.
[02:10:39.444 --> 02:10:42.986]  Saying nothing is saying something to go in against Qaddafi.
[02:10:43.067 --> 02:10:47.049]  Certainly a thug, but the globalists are openly sending in British and U.S.
[02:10:47.089 --> 02:10:49.811]  Special Forces, weapons out of Saudi Arabia, weapons out of Egypt.
[02:10:50.271 --> 02:10:52.353]  They thought they could beat him just with the rebel forces.
[02:10:52.873 --> 02:10:58.477]  In the no-fly announcement, no-fly now means a total bombardment of all of his military forces in the country.
[02:10:59.637 --> 02:11:00.938]  Uh, and, uh, U.S.
[02:11:01.078 --> 02:11:02.119]  fleet is moving in.
[02:11:02.139 --> 02:11:04.280]  Uh, this is out of Reuters.
[02:11:04.700 --> 02:11:04.920]  U.S.
[02:11:04.940 --> 02:11:07.161]  to deploy more ships to support Libya planning.
[02:11:07.641 --> 02:11:09.482]  That'll be the cruise missiles from the missile cruisers.
[02:11:10.243 --> 02:11:15.025]  Uh, NATO, the British, the French are openly saying they may start striking today.
[02:11:15.305 --> 02:11:16.165]  They said that last night.
[02:11:16.205 --> 02:11:16.846]  They haven't yet.
[02:11:18.115 --> 02:11:21.516]  On his sights, he immediately rolled over and said, okay, I want to cease fire.
[02:11:21.576 --> 02:11:27.177]  Tell your al-Qaeda funded, which is actually true out of Saudi Arabia, groups to stop attacking and I'll stop shooting.
[02:11:27.537 --> 02:11:30.497]  And they're like, no, they will attack you, you will take it.
[02:11:31.197 --> 02:11:34.658]  Now again, I don't like Gaddafi, but this is a larger globalist program.
[02:11:34.838 --> 02:11:38.339]  We'll get Bob Chapman's take on that destabilization program as well.
[02:11:38.659 --> 02:11:44.100]  Also, New York Fed confirms intervention in currency markets, something Chapman's been talking about for 20 years.
[02:11:44.560 --> 02:11:46.300]  Bob Chapman, formerly military intelligence,
[02:11:47.340 --> 02:11:48.821]  Put out the Gary Allen report.
[02:11:48.841 --> 02:11:50.522]  Of course, his son today runs Politico.
[02:11:50.822 --> 02:11:53.483]  Gary Allen published None Dare Call a Conspiracy with Bob Chapman.
[02:11:53.863 --> 02:11:56.164]  Chapman fighting for 48 years against the globalists.
[02:11:56.624 --> 02:12:00.245]  Before he retired, the biggest private silver and gold broker in the world.
[02:12:00.846 --> 02:12:04.227]  And the biggest private newsletter until he came back a few years ago out of retirement.
[02:12:04.547 --> 02:12:06.708]  And now it's internationalforecaster.com.
[02:12:07.128 --> 02:12:10.229]  I, of course, am Alex Jones with infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[02:12:11.510 --> 02:12:19.399]  If you're having trouble getting on InfoWars.com, go to the auxiliary mega site, PrisonPlanet.com, WhatIsTheEndGame.com, JonesReport.com.
[02:12:20.620 --> 02:12:22.802]  Also our Facebook, also our YouTube.
[02:12:22.842 --> 02:12:24.164]  We have a lot of auxiliary systems.
[02:12:24.604 --> 02:12:27.508]  We're going to go to Don, Will, Jennifer, Mike.
[02:12:27.528 --> 02:12:30.170]  It looks like Dom, who we talked to in two segments, is still there.
[02:12:30.811 --> 02:12:39.115]  Well, my big question is why didn't other nations, particularly the United States, China, Russia, England, why didn't they immediately come to the aid of these people?
[02:13:01.313 --> 02:13:01.913]  I get that.
[02:13:04.014 --> 02:13:14.337]  I think that's a key thing here because had they acted, could they have, under the circumstances, they might have been able to help.
[02:13:15.037 --> 02:13:18.938]  Auxiliary electrical power, auxiliary water.
[02:13:20.118 --> 02:13:21.319]  Why wasn't that done?
[02:13:21.339 --> 02:13:24.239]  Now they're talking about doing it.
[02:13:25.080 --> 02:13:25.840]  That was a week ago.
[02:13:26.325 --> 02:13:28.366]  Well, Bob, we know why they pulled out on Saturday.
[02:13:28.766 --> 02:13:31.087]  That's because the high radiation levels we now know.
[02:13:31.148 --> 02:13:33.169]  We said that Saturday, but now it's confirmed.
[02:13:33.189 --> 02:13:38.932]  But why haven't we, seven days in, had radiation meters from the giant Pacific Fleet, the U.S.
[02:13:38.972 --> 02:13:40.853]  troops at Okinawa, the U.S.
[02:13:40.893 --> 02:13:42.834]  troops in and around that area?
[02:13:43.114 --> 02:13:45.655]  They've been covering up, along with the Japanese, the real readings.
[02:13:47.176 --> 02:13:50.578]  Well, they get their orders from the same source.
[02:13:50.858 --> 02:13:52.338]  It's very disturbing.
[02:13:54.463 --> 02:14:03.827]  A human point of view, people, perhaps many of them, dying needlessly, they've been able to do something.
[02:14:04.607 --> 02:14:08.809]  And now, of course, we've got it traveling toward America and throughout the world.
[02:14:10.529 --> 02:14:11.810]  I think, you know, you've really...
[02:14:13.496 --> 02:14:15.758]  Bob, listen, I'm going to have to put you on hold.
[02:14:16.038 --> 02:14:17.219]  Will you call us right back?
[02:14:17.259 --> 02:14:18.579]  I know you're in the Southern Hemisphere.
[02:14:18.619 --> 02:14:20.221]  Lucky, lucky dog, you.
[02:14:20.261 --> 02:14:21.762]  But reconnect with us.
[02:14:21.782 --> 02:14:23.983]  We've got a very bad connection with Bob Chapman.
[02:14:24.023 --> 02:14:26.925]  I really want to get his take on all of this.
[02:14:26.965 --> 02:14:32.749]  But Bob Chapman will reconnect with Genesis so we can continue to break down what's happening.
[02:14:32.769 --> 02:14:41.795]  And yes, we've been almost 100 percent accurate in our forecasting of what's unfolded because we've studied past globalist playbooks and past meltdowns.
[02:14:43.956 --> 02:14:47.280]  I am unhappy, very displeased that I've been correct.
[02:14:47.700 --> 02:14:48.661]  I wish I was wrong.
[02:14:49.081 --> 02:14:58.451]  You see, I live in Texas, and it's scheduled to get here as well, because the plume's going more southerly than what forecasters at first thought, and we'll cross into where I live, and I have children I love.
[02:14:59.051 --> 02:14:59.732]  Well, it's just kind of scary.
[02:14:59.752 --> 02:15:00.312]  I mean, I live here.
[02:15:00.332 --> 02:15:01.713]  That's about all I want to say about that.
[02:15:01.733 --> 02:15:04.295]  You know, I might have to actually think about maybe moving back.
[02:15:04.415 --> 02:15:04.675]  I don't know.
[02:15:28.703 --> 02:15:30.183]  I'll have to talk to some more people, I guess.
[02:15:30.203 --> 02:15:31.144]  See what they're doing.
[02:15:33.384 --> 02:15:33.985]  It's too bad.
[02:15:34.005 --> 02:15:34.525]  I like it here.
[02:15:34.565 --> 02:15:37.246]  I've been living here for, like, nine, ten years.
[02:15:38.186 --> 02:15:38.426]  You know?
[02:15:41.687 --> 02:15:42.487]  Are you there, Alex?
[02:15:42.747 --> 02:15:43.307]  Yes, sir.
[02:15:43.327 --> 02:15:45.288]  They were popping in my ear, telling me Bob was back.
[02:15:45.728 --> 02:15:48.989]  I mean, it's crazy here.
[02:15:50.670 --> 02:15:52.510]  Was that a question at the end, Dom?
[02:15:54.311 --> 02:15:55.491]  No, not a question.
[02:15:55.511 --> 02:15:56.211]  Just a comment.
[02:15:58.354 --> 02:16:02.997]  If you have time, I wouldn't mind just talking one little thing about 9-1-1.
[02:16:03.237 --> 02:16:03.937]  Sure.
[02:16:04.958 --> 02:16:05.578]  If it's okay.
[02:16:07.059 --> 02:16:14.783]  You might want to talk about and tell your listeners about the map of Bin Laden's Mountain Fortress.
[02:16:16.464 --> 02:16:21.367]  You probably remember the Meet the Press program with Donald Rumsfeld.
[02:16:21.387 --> 02:16:27.391]  They held up this big map and said there isn't just one of those, there's a whole bunch of those caves.
[02:16:29.167 --> 02:16:30.429]  If you go online, you can actually find that.
[02:16:30.509 --> 02:16:31.570]  No, it's ridiculous.
[02:16:31.630 --> 02:16:37.759]  It was this giant, 10-story underground Cobra Commander fantasy base, completely made up.
[02:16:39.802 --> 02:16:43.748]  Yeah, and I'm sure you've seen the documentary, The Power of Nightmare.
[02:16:44.048 --> 02:16:44.669]  Yes, BBC.
[02:16:46.385 --> 02:16:49.406]  No, I've had a few reports from people who live there, who are subscribers,
[02:17:15.482 --> 02:17:18.185]  And they were preliminary.
[02:17:18.285 --> 02:17:21.308]  I haven't had one, so I'm not up to date on that.
[02:17:22.849 --> 02:17:30.756]  You know, the only thing that you hadn't said anything about in the last perhaps five to ten minutes prior to my coming on, I heard.
[02:17:31.437 --> 02:17:32.758]  And you covered it very well.
[02:17:33.519 --> 02:17:36.802]  And the only thing I had was, why didn't they get some help sooner?
[02:17:37.336 --> 02:17:37.937]  Absolutely.
[02:17:37.977 --> 02:17:39.398]  Thank you, Dom, from Japan.
[02:17:39.818 --> 02:17:40.859]  We're going to get a break soon.
[02:17:41.080 --> 02:17:43.242]  Back to Will, Jennifer, Mike, and others with Bob Chapman.
[02:17:43.262 --> 02:17:49.948]  But Bob, shifting gears into Libya, now a no-fly zone means bombing a country.
[02:17:50.268 --> 02:17:55.453]  No congressional declaration, not even a congressional authorization, just the U.N.
[02:17:55.793 --> 02:17:56.073]  now.
[02:17:56.173 --> 02:17:57.174]  Notice what's happening here.
[02:17:57.214 --> 02:17:58.035]  The U.N.
[02:17:58.095 --> 02:17:58.315]  now
[02:17:59.256 --> 02:18:02.858]  In plain view, is basically ordering NATO and the U.S.
[02:18:02.918 --> 02:18:03.318]  in there.
[02:18:04.059 --> 02:18:05.339]  This has never happened before.
[02:18:05.700 --> 02:18:07.460]  I mean, Congress has nothing to say.
[02:18:08.081 --> 02:18:15.585]  And now we're being told that a no-fly means a bombardment of the country because it's wrong to strafe civilians.
[02:18:15.605 --> 02:18:16.805]  But it turns out that was a lie.
[02:18:17.045 --> 02:18:19.807]  Turns out he didn't run to Venezuela.
[02:18:20.027 --> 02:18:22.829]  Turns out he didn't run to South Africa or Zimbabwe.
[02:18:23.189 --> 02:18:26.250]  I mean, the point is, I don't like Gaddafi, but they lie about everything.
[02:18:26.510 --> 02:18:27.351]  It's about that oil.
[02:18:27.631 --> 02:18:28.591]  What do you see happening?
[02:18:28.611 --> 02:18:29.872]  What do you think is really going on in Libya?
[02:18:31.212 --> 02:18:32.232]  Look at the background.
[02:18:33.853 --> 02:18:40.375]  The evolutionary process of who really is in the Qaddafi camp.
[02:18:41.575 --> 02:18:54.999]  And if you go back into the 50s and 60s, in particular, you'll see that the British royal family has been a big sponsor of Qaddafi for whatever reason.
[02:18:56.412 --> 02:19:10.339]  And also, there has been, over the years, special people who, kind of at the beginning, were allowed to go into Libya and take oil out.
[02:19:11.200 --> 02:19:18.063]  And of all those people, if you can recall this, was Occidental Petroleum, which was Armin Hama.
[02:19:19.184 --> 02:19:22.846]  And I knew Armin Hama because I was in his office in L.A.
[02:19:25.280 --> 02:19:31.739]  He would come and sell convertible to ventures and to do his drilling and raise funds.
[02:19:33.044 --> 02:19:33.985]  And stay there.
[02:19:34.145 --> 02:19:39.447]  Tell us about Armand Hammer, the communist controller of Al Gore's father.
[02:19:40.148 --> 02:19:47.211]  Of course, Al Gore is one of the biggest owners of Occidental Petroleum, and so he shuts down his competition so he makes more money.
[02:19:47.251 --> 02:19:47.611]  Stay there.
[02:19:47.631 --> 02:19:50.533]  I want to look at the behind-the-scenes politics of Libya.
[02:19:51.133 --> 02:19:53.014]  Umar Qaddafi knows where the bodies are buried.
[02:19:53.454 --> 02:19:55.596]  What is the larger strategy in removing him?
[02:19:55.676 --> 02:19:57.096]  Obviously, they're puppets CIA.
[02:19:57.536 --> 02:19:59.778]  MI6 people couldn't beat him, so now the bombs are coming.
[02:20:00.698 --> 02:20:03.800]  Do you want to learn more about preparing for the hard times ahead?

[02:21:29.947 --> 02:21:31.008]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:21:31.188 --> 02:21:35.571]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:21:35.751 --> 02:21:41.455]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:21:41.555 --> 02:21:44.977]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:21:45.197 --> 02:21:47.799]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:47.919 --> 02:21:52.822]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[02:21:53.223 --> 02:21:54.624]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:00.187 --> 02:22:01.747]  America, you've been warned.
[02:22:02.128 --> 02:22:08.989]  For weeks, we've been warning you about a single event we believe will happen in the next 12 months that will shake the very foundations of our nation.
[02:22:09.169 --> 02:22:12.190]  We've told you about the video that details this shocking prediction.
[02:22:12.530 --> 02:22:15.971]  So far, over 6 million people have watched this free video online.
[02:22:16.211 --> 02:22:16.651]  Have you?
[02:22:17.031 --> 02:22:22.772]  Again, this big event has nothing to do with war or the stock market, yet it could change everything about your normal way of life.
[02:22:22.892 --> 02:22:23.253]  I don't know.
[02:22:41.343 --> 02:22:41.803]  We're good.
[02:23:00.461 --> 02:23:02.663]  The food storage industry leader has done it again.
[02:23:02.943 --> 02:23:07.047]  Introducing FDG Clubs and Survival Bucks from the Freeze Dry Guy.

[02:23:47.548 --> 02:23:49.751]  That's freezedryguy.com or call 866-404-3663.
[02:23:49.811 --> 02:23:51.033]  The Freeze Dry Guy.
[02:23:51.053 --> 02:23:52.054]  The best you can buy.
[02:24:35.834 --> 02:24:41.679]  Well, Obama is saying that Qaddafi chose the path of brutalism.
[02:24:41.760 --> 02:24:43.441]  Well, but it's okay when our government's brutal.
[02:24:44.302 --> 02:24:49.227]  It's just totally hypocritical, and they are definitely gearing up to invade.
[02:24:49.367 --> 02:24:49.627]  U.S.
[02:24:49.667 --> 02:24:51.168]  ships are moving into the area.
[02:24:52.189 --> 02:24:58.331]  And so, back in the late 1940s, early 50s, he and Occidental, the company he controlled, were allowed to go in there, and what you had to say earlier,
[02:25:20.374 --> 02:25:25.577]  Uh, about Al Gore and his father being bought and paid for by Oppenheimer is true.
[02:25:26.577 --> 02:25:39.864]  And, uh, after the wall came down and the Soviet Union ceased to be, the Russian government told the world that Oppenheimer had been one of their for many, many, many years.
[02:25:40.824 --> 02:25:48.848]  So that to me tells me that's why the Europeans made an arrangement
[02:25:49.814 --> 02:25:52.595]  With Gaddafi for him to be in there pumping oil.
[02:25:52.956 --> 02:25:54.496]  Because he was buddies with the Russians.
[02:25:54.536 --> 02:25:58.978]  Now your phone cut out when you said that Armand Hammer came out was a Russian agent.
[02:26:00.719 --> 02:26:01.359]  Yes it did.
[02:26:02.400 --> 02:26:11.504]  After the fall of the wall and government changed in Russia, the Russians came out and said that he was a longtime agent of the Russian government.
[02:26:13.126 --> 02:26:14.547]  Amazing.
[02:26:14.587 --> 02:26:16.908]  That's why he got what he got.
[02:26:17.468 --> 02:26:18.469]  And the goers knew that.
[02:26:19.029 --> 02:26:22.030]  These people, there's nothing political about this.
[02:26:22.771 --> 02:26:26.052]  This is just one gang of criminals helping each other.
[02:26:26.773 --> 02:26:31.635]  Things have changed, and so they want to make changes in the Middle East.
[02:26:32.435 --> 02:26:37.278]  And as you explained, the rebels were incapable of taking him down.
[02:26:37.698 --> 02:26:39.118]  He now realizes that.
[02:26:40.789 --> 02:26:43.172]  He's going to have to deal with us, so he's backed off.
[02:26:44.113 --> 02:26:46.756]  And some sort of a deal will probably be made.
[02:26:47.817 --> 02:26:49.259]  What that deal will be, I don't know.
[02:26:50.560 --> 02:26:57.183]  Well, Obama is basically now signaling that there is going to be an attack, and they're moving U.S.
[02:26:57.763 --> 02:26:58.183]  forces.
[02:26:58.203 --> 02:27:02.425]  The United States will deploy additional amphibious ships to the Mediterranean.
[02:27:02.445 --> 02:27:07.988]  The military said on Friday, as part of Obama administration's plans for responding to ongoing violence in Libya.
[02:27:08.028 --> 02:27:11.970]  So now if there's ever violence in a country, we've got to invade it and pay for it.
[02:27:12.450 --> 02:27:14.491]  The USS Bataan amphibious
[02:27:15.111 --> 02:27:30.252]  Ready Group, by the way folks, that's an invasion ship to put ground troops in, will deploy March 23rd, so it looks like they're getting ready to invade next week, ahead of its original schedule in order to relieve units from the USS
[02:27:33.063 --> 02:27:34.623]  And it looks like they're bringing in probably U.S.
[02:27:34.643 --> 02:27:34.923]  Marines.
[02:27:35.344 --> 02:27:37.024]  And they probably are going to be met with
[02:28:02.423 --> 02:28:03.064]  Gaddafi.
[02:28:04.044 --> 02:28:05.165]  Who will not attack them?
[02:28:06.306 --> 02:28:07.788]  You know, he has no hope of winning.
[02:28:08.889 --> 02:28:12.192]  And so then it'll be an occupational situation.
[02:28:13.012 --> 02:28:15.915]  And we'll have another Iraq and Afghanistan on our hands.
[02:28:17.213 --> 02:28:36.506]  Bob, to interject before we go to break, Obama is saying if they don't accept UN forces for humanitarian aid in their armored vehicles, basically taking control of the country, and that's what it is, an occupation under the name of humanitarian assistance, that they will invade with military force.
[02:28:37.066 --> 02:28:39.648]  So he's now been clear on that front.
[02:28:39.708 --> 02:28:44.311]  So accept occupation, give up, let the assistance come in, or
[02:28:46.911 --> 02:28:50.352]  We will bombard you and basically invade you.
[02:28:50.632 --> 02:28:55.073]  I mean this is incredible and this all came from a UN directive.
[02:28:55.353 --> 02:28:57.993]  Here's the US basically following the UN's orders.
[02:28:59.513 --> 02:29:05.675]  Which means that the United States and the President has nothing to say about anything.
[02:29:06.115 --> 02:29:08.115]  The UN is now making those decisions.
[02:29:08.755 --> 02:29:13.816]  So we live under a one world government, not the United States government or any other sovereign government.
[02:29:17.042 --> 02:29:18.303]  Well, this is just incredible.
[02:29:18.323 --> 02:29:22.907]  We're going to come back and get into the economy, get more into the earthquake, get into New York.
[02:29:22.967 --> 02:29:25.169]  Fed confirms intervention in currency markets.
[02:29:26.030 --> 02:29:30.153]  If Bob's phone continues to break up, we'll let him finish up on these topics and then have him leave us.
[02:29:30.213 --> 02:29:32.895]  Unfortunately, it is breaking up the worst it ever has.
[02:29:33.256 --> 02:29:34.557]  He is not in the United States.
[02:29:34.597 --> 02:29:35.538]  He's in the Southern Hemisphere.
[02:29:37.279 --> 02:29:45.928]  We will go to your phone calls coming up, and we'll look at the Federal Reserve now admits they're manipulating markets internally, something that they've denied for a long time.
[02:29:46.009 --> 02:29:48.011]  Bob, of course, exposed it decades ago.
[02:29:50.934 --> 02:29:51.835]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.335 --> 02:29:53.937]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.858 --> 02:29:57.541]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.615 --> 02:30:04.076]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[02:30:04.456 --> 02:30:08.497]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[02:30:08.717 --> 02:30:13.758]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[02:30:13.838 --> 02:30:18.600]  Not looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[02:30:19.360 --> 02:30:22.841]  Not worried about them moving south.
[02:30:23.021 --> 02:30:26.402]  Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[02:30:29.319 --> 02:30:36.085]  We're American and be proud.
[02:30:36.145 --> 02:30:39.048]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[02:30:55.111 --> 02:30:59.682]  And you, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[02:31:01.661 --> 02:31:08.367]  Alex has told you that the Mideast uprisings over food prices and shortages caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide.
[02:31:08.707 --> 02:31:10.949]  We're seeing the impact right here in the United States.
[02:31:11.369 --> 02:31:20.176]  Ethanol, that was supposed to reduce petroleum use and fuel prices, hit a 30-month high in February, and pump prices are expected to reach $5 a gallon.
[02:31:20.416 --> 02:31:28.323]  Because of shipping costs, food is being priced out of the reach of millions of Americans, with an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days.
[02:31:28.683 --> 02:31:29.804]  Move quickly while you can
[02:31:31.820 --> 02:31:32.200]  We're good.
[02:32:04.286 --> 02:32:05.227]  Tyranny is here.
[02:32:05.547 --> 02:32:09.269]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:32:09.429 --> 02:32:11.691]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:32:11.711 --> 02:32:17.154]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:32:17.595 --> 02:32:23.839]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:32:24.239 --> 02:32:29.784]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:32:30.224 --> 02:32:33.887]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:32:34.407 --> 02:32:38.371]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:32:38.691 --> 02:32:44.215]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:32:44.636 --> 02:32:47.618]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:32:48.199 --> 02:32:49.640]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:32:50.180 --> 02:32:50.621]  It's here.
[02:32:51.261 --> 02:32:58.303]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:33:03.444 --> 02:33:04.184]  Big Brother.
[02:33:04.424 --> 02:33:05.725]  Mainstream media.
[02:33:06.105 --> 02:33:07.325]  Government cover-ups.
[02:33:07.485 --> 02:33:08.465]  You want answers?
[02:33:08.745 --> 02:33:09.986]  Well, so does he.
[02:33:10.826 --> 02:33:14.707]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:19.689 --> 02:33:22.017]  Obviously we'll be back live this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:33:25.789 --> 02:33:38.272]  And if the radiation starts intensifying as more of the fallout approaches the United States, you look for notes at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:33:38.332 --> 02:33:45.373]  I may do some internet, video, audio streams just at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com over the weekend.
[02:33:45.913 --> 02:33:52.375]  Stations that want to pick those up, it won't be on the satellite, but you'll be able to pick up the audio stream or reports that we do for our affiliates out there.
[02:33:53.475 --> 02:33:55.836]  Continued here with the news.
[02:33:56.036 --> 02:33:59.377]  Libya's Qaddafi is under threat from allied military forces.
[02:34:00.117 --> 02:34:08.900]  Libya's Muammar Qaddafi is now under threat from a growing force of advanced Western aircraft and missiles intended to reverse the balance of power in the North African conflict.
[02:34:08.920 --> 02:34:10.161]  So this is a direct overthrow.
[02:34:10.521 --> 02:34:12.122]  Nothing to do with humanitarian issues.
[02:34:12.162 --> 02:34:13.162]  The globalists could care less.
[02:34:13.402 --> 02:34:15.723]  They'd rather dictators that they control in power.
[02:34:16.483 --> 02:34:30.013]  The North Atlantic Treaty Organization members, Britain, France, Denmark, Spain, and Canada, along with the U.S., have pledged plans and planes to a mission over Libya, according to government statements and press reports, and they're moving amphibious invasion ships in.
[02:34:30.613 --> 02:34:33.015]  And Qatar said it would participate in the plan.
[02:34:33.055 --> 02:34:33.635]  The U.S.
[02:34:33.795 --> 02:34:40.160]  is deploying the Toronado, a BAE Systems Eurofighter, Typhoon jets,
[02:34:40.680 --> 02:34:50.127]  French Foreign Minister Alan Juppe commented on military action, told reporters in Paris, we are ready, but I can't provide a precise timetable.
[02:34:50.828 --> 02:34:54.671]  So this is really another war.
[02:34:55.271 --> 02:34:57.033]  Reuters reporting U.S.
[02:34:57.273 --> 02:34:59.615]  heads towards risky Libya engagement.
[02:34:59.975 --> 02:35:05.620]  The United States moved towards potentially deep and risky engagement in Libya's bloody political crisis.
[02:35:06.580 --> 02:35:10.902]  Friday, vowing to remove defiant leader Muammar Gaddafi and halt violence against embattled rebels.
[02:35:11.602 --> 02:35:13.683]  We don't know what the final outcome will be.
[02:35:14.063 --> 02:35:16.804]  The first and overwhelmingly urgent action is to end the violence.
[02:35:16.884 --> 02:35:19.225]  Oh, they care so much about that.
[02:35:19.245 --> 02:35:21.966]  Remember, they've lied about him going to Venezuela.
[02:35:21.986 --> 02:35:24.147]  They lied about him fleeing to Zimbabwe.
[02:35:24.167 --> 02:35:26.028]  They lied about him strafing people.
[02:35:26.068 --> 02:35:26.968]  That was later confirmed.
[02:35:27.008 --> 02:35:28.248]  He strafed rebels.
[02:35:28.528 --> 02:35:29.529]  I'm not saying that's good.
[02:35:29.569 --> 02:35:30.409]  I don't like Gaddafi.
[02:35:30.569 --> 02:35:33.650]  The point is it's all hypocritical lies were being given.
[02:35:36.325 --> 02:35:42.328]  Bob Chapman, Libya has declared a ceasefire, saying, OK, rebels don't shoot at us, we won't shoot at you.
[02:35:42.889 --> 02:35:45.210]  And Obama's come out and said, doesn't matter now.
[02:35:45.570 --> 02:35:52.094]  You accept a, quote, peaceful takeover and invasion on humanitarian grounds, or we're going to blow the daylights out of you, Bob Chapman.
[02:35:53.595 --> 02:35:55.116]  And that's exactly what's going on.
[02:35:56.056 --> 02:36:05.562]  And I think they, as I said several weeks ago, the people who started all this going, the CIA, MI6, and the Mossad,
[02:36:06.634 --> 02:36:07.895]  I think they made a big mistake.
[02:36:08.935 --> 02:36:19.060]  They made some of the changes they wanted, but they had to use violence in Libya and also in Bahrain to a great extent.
[02:36:19.141 --> 02:36:26.664]  I saw movies yesterday of military people shooting civilians out of hand.
[02:36:27.825 --> 02:36:29.786]  I mean, I've never seen anything like that before.
[02:36:30.675 --> 02:36:33.056]  I mean, just murder, assassination.
[02:36:33.156 --> 02:36:35.096]  Yeah, Saudi Arabia is shooting people.
[02:36:35.776 --> 02:36:37.357]  Bahrain is shooting people.
[02:36:37.717 --> 02:36:40.357]  But when they do, it's loving and good and caring.
[02:36:40.957 --> 02:36:41.377]  Okay.
[02:36:44.038 --> 02:36:48.859]  Well, I think this is going to continue and not in a way that they like.
[02:36:49.719 --> 02:36:52.220]  And they're going to have more problems along the way.
[02:36:52.240 --> 02:36:57.021]  And people who are investors throughout the world
[02:36:57.742 --> 02:37:01.743]  Now I think that things are going to get better in Japan as well as the Middle East.
[02:37:02.183 --> 02:37:03.323]  And that simply isn't the case.
[02:37:04.124 --> 02:37:04.664]  Bob!
[02:37:05.064 --> 02:37:07.084]  Now go ahead.
[02:37:07.225 --> 02:37:07.425]  Yes?
[02:37:07.805 --> 02:37:09.025]  Now your phone's just breaking up.
[02:37:09.325 --> 02:37:10.305]  Clinton says U.N.
[02:37:10.345 --> 02:37:13.446]  resolution on Libya only one step.
[02:37:14.026 --> 02:37:20.008]  And they're saying we are going to be not responsive or impressed by words.
[02:37:20.848 --> 02:37:23.989]  We would have to see actions on the ground and that is not yet
[02:37:24.349 --> 02:37:24.509]  I think?
[02:37:46.714 --> 02:37:58.844]  And now that you mention it, the answer is yes.
[02:37:59.545 --> 02:37:59.885]  Why?
[02:38:00.406 --> 02:38:05.650]  To divert attention away from a financial system that's collapsing.
[02:38:06.271 --> 02:38:13.537]  And the only way it can be kept afloat is by quantitative easing, stimulus from governments,
[02:38:13.945 --> 02:38:18.388]  It's not just the United States, it's a number of nations, particularly Europe and England.
[02:38:19.228 --> 02:38:23.711]  And if they stop that assistance, the whole thing's going to collapse.
[02:38:24.031 --> 02:38:25.712]  So they want to take that out of the news.
[02:38:26.212 --> 02:38:35.257]  And I explained this several weeks ago when this started, that I thought it was a disinformation move along with other things in the Middle East.
[02:38:35.557 --> 02:38:37.398]  And now, of course, Japan's popped up.
[02:38:39.179 --> 02:38:42.181]  But you would think that people in the markets
[02:38:43.180 --> 02:38:44.843]  Would not be buyers, they'd be sellers.
[02:38:44.903 --> 02:38:46.025]  Yes, there was some selling.
[02:38:46.465 --> 02:38:49.370]  The Dow went down about 500 points, but it's going right back up again.
[02:38:49.931 --> 02:38:50.451]  Alright, Bob.
[02:38:50.471 --> 02:38:53.176]  Because, obviously, they've got information that we don't have.
[02:38:53.888 --> 02:39:17.120]  Bob, you're here every Friday with us in the last hour, but your phone, again, we've tried three times, it's so bad today, and we're going to end this interview in a moment, but I wanted to finish up with one of the issues that you've been writing about for close to 50 years, and that is the private Federal Reserve manipulating the currency market, something they've always denied, but now here's the AP today.
[02:39:17.140 --> 02:39:19.901]  New York Fed confirms intervention in currency markets.
[02:39:20.241 --> 02:39:21.022]  They're doing more than that.
[02:39:21.042 --> 02:39:23.143]  The stock market, as you know, with the Plunge Protection Team.
[02:39:23.903 --> 02:39:31.131]  The New York Federal Reserve confirmed that it intervened in currency markets today for the first time in more than a decade.
[02:39:31.392 --> 02:39:38.620]  The disclosure came a day after the group of seven major industrial nations pledged in a statement to join in a coordinated effort to
[02:39:38.800 --> 02:39:41.601]  Well, first of all, we have the Japanese prior to the end of the month
[02:40:08.220 --> 02:40:21.124]  Evening up their books and that causes the yen to go higher as they sell foreign securities or of some kind of foreign currencies to bring the money home for their balance sheets.
[02:40:22.404 --> 02:40:25.485]  And this has happened at the worst possible time.
[02:40:26.585 --> 02:40:29.566]  There are a number of people are in the yen carry trade.
[02:40:30.847 --> 02:40:32.027]  I can't go into that because
[02:40:32.791 --> 02:40:34.772]  We don't have time, and it's too intricate.
[02:40:35.153 --> 02:40:48.121]  But what it means is the people who have borrowed yen to go out and buy other things with the yen converted into, say, dollars or pounds or whatever, they're getting their heads handed to them.
[02:40:49.182 --> 02:40:51.503]  And that's one of the reasons they want to stabilize it.
[02:40:51.844 --> 02:40:52.424]  Who is they?
[02:40:53.004 --> 02:40:55.166]  Usually the banks, hedge funds, etc.
[02:40:55.866 --> 02:40:58.348]  They're very highly leveraged, and that's one of the ways they do it.
[02:40:58.988 --> 02:41:01.350]  So that's why the G7 really did what they did.
[02:41:02.472 --> 02:41:08.135]  To say the people who had been speculating and using the yen as a basis to do that.
[02:41:10.157 --> 02:41:11.798]  What's going to happen to gold and silver?
[02:41:11.818 --> 02:41:29.868]  Over and over and over again, Alex, these charters and wavers and cyclists have been telling us for five years that the markets in gold and silver are going to correct from here to there, from here to there, etc, etc.
[02:41:30.108 --> 02:41:30.869]  And it never happens.
[02:41:32.645 --> 02:41:42.009]  What's happened is, all of these things coming together, especially with the Federal Reserve, are going to create much more inflation.
[02:41:42.389 --> 02:41:44.189]  You saw the numbers that came out yesterday.
[02:41:44.690 --> 02:41:45.350]  Devastating.
[02:41:46.530 --> 02:41:50.932]  We'll be 14% easy by the end of the year in inflation, and they know that.
[02:41:52.172 --> 02:41:59.075]  And that's why gold and silver are getting an extra push upward, because they react in a positive manner
[02:41:59.983 --> 02:42:04.985]  To currencies being degraded, the dollar in this case, among others.
[02:42:05.866 --> 02:42:19.591]  So what's going to happen is gold and silver are going to move strongly upward, which is an apposition to what 96% of newsletter writers are saying, because they're using charts, etc.
[02:42:20.252 --> 02:42:21.272]  to make their decisions.
[02:42:21.772 --> 02:42:25.634]  And you can't do that because the government is rigging the market
[02:42:26.758 --> 02:42:30.179]  To the Blunge Protection Team, the Working Group on Financial Markets.
[02:42:50.247 --> 02:42:51.229]  Competitively priced.
[02:42:51.610 --> 02:42:53.393]  Give Midas Resources a call 800-686-2237.
[02:42:56.500 --> 02:42:58.243]  Bob Chapman, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:42:59.266 --> 02:42:59.766]  You're welcome.
[02:42:59.806 --> 02:43:00.547]  I'll see you next week.
[02:43:00.647 --> 02:43:00.947]  Bye-bye.
[02:43:01.187 --> 02:43:01.728]  Bye-bye, Bob.
[02:43:02.168 --> 02:43:07.831]  We usually have him for the full hour, but his phone, as you could hear, was just completely hammered, and we can't put that out on air too long.
[02:43:08.632 --> 02:43:11.974]  We tried three times to get him to call back with a better connection, but it didn't work.
[02:43:12.014 --> 02:43:13.095]  He's in South America.
[02:43:13.815 --> 02:43:16.297]  Let's go ahead and go to your phone calls.
[02:43:16.417 --> 02:43:21.100]  Will, Jennifer, Sean, Mike, I'm gonna get to you, but first, David in Japan.
[02:43:21.540 --> 02:43:23.141]  Sir, how are you holding up there?
[02:43:25.302 --> 02:43:26.743]  Well, things are going okay.
[02:43:26.803 --> 02:43:27.364]  To be honest,
[02:43:28.459 --> 02:43:36.521]  When I listened to your Sunday show and looking at the other information as well, myself and my wife decided to leave where we were.
[02:43:36.581 --> 02:43:42.843]  We were in Kansai, but we went to Okinawa, which is the southernmost island.
[02:43:45.464 --> 02:43:52.046]  But just seeing the news, there's some more information that hasn't really come out in the Western media that I wanted to mention.
[02:43:53.002 --> 02:44:15.702]  Particularly on Monday in the news it was reported that the Prime Minister Kan was overheard arguing with the, this actually came out on the television, he was overheard arguing with the Tokyo Electric Company persons and at first the Tokyo Electric employees were going to completely abandon the plant and not take any action whatsoever.
[02:44:16.789 --> 02:44:18.190]  Because of the radioactivity levels.
[02:44:18.210 --> 02:44:26.902]  And then Cannes was heard shouting at them saying, we could lose Western Japan if you don't do something.
[02:44:27.925 --> 02:44:30.808]  And, uh, sorry, uh, Eastern Japan.
[02:44:30.848 --> 02:44:32.789]  He said we could lose Eastern Japan if we don't do anything about it.
[02:44:32.829 --> 02:44:34.130]  Well, that's what my dad said.
[02:44:34.150 --> 02:44:36.552]  I mean, there are many areas of Ukraine that are uninhabitable.
[02:44:36.893 --> 02:44:40.836]  This could take a large area of Northeastern Japan and make it uninhabitable.
[02:44:41.076 --> 02:44:45.860]  And if they completely melt down, it could completely radiate Tokyo with 37 million people.
[02:44:45.900 --> 02:44:54.127]  And now the head of the plant has broken down and cried and admitted basically a cover-up and said it is highly radioactive enough to kill people and broke down crying.
[02:44:54.367 --> 02:44:55.909]  How are the Japanese responding to that?
[02:44:57.247 --> 02:45:11.899]  Well, you see, the way it's been covered in the media here, it's difficult to understand because the awareness of nuclear energy and how dangerous it is, is probably higher abroad.
[02:45:12.577 --> 02:45:22.806]  In Japan and the media here, they're giving out a lot of technical information, but I think most of the ordinary people really don't understand the implications of what they're being told.
[02:45:22.826 --> 02:45:33.454]  They're giving the technical information, but they're still saying, it's not a permanent problem for human health, or this could be terrible, but then they don't say exactly what it is.
[02:45:34.545 --> 02:45:52.928]  The Japanese people, I think, are more focused on the comprehensible human aspects of the tragedy, which are still the deaths due to the tsunami and the difficulty of how the people are trying to survive in the relocation areas that have been evacuated, you know?
[02:45:53.288 --> 02:46:01.450]  They're focusing on the difficulty of their life in terms of they don't have food or the more ordinary human problems.
[02:46:05.666 --> 02:46:08.267]  What is the press reporting the radiation levels are there?
[02:46:12.709 --> 02:46:13.789]  Well, it varies.
[02:46:14.470 --> 02:46:26.815]  The information we're giving out is different, but they just, on the news just a short while ago, they said that the Tokyo Electric decided that it was acceptable for their employees to be exposed to 250 millisieverts
[02:46:29.062 --> 02:46:34.665]  Uh, while working, which is basically a change in Japanese regulation or law.
[02:46:36.286 --> 02:46:38.027]  So that's a pretty big thing.
[02:46:39.059 --> 02:46:53.345]  Well, we've got to pray for those valiant souls, the Fukushima 50, that rotate in groups of about 188 people in groups of 50 rotating in, because they are pointing out that this radiation can kill the people there.
[02:46:54.305 --> 02:46:58.027]  Are the Japanese concerned about the news, or is it being played big in your press?
[02:46:58.707 --> 02:46:59.528]  It's in the U.S.
[02:46:59.568 --> 02:47:05.030]  press that the meteorologists are predicting in the next 48 hours the wind is going to turn towards the south again.
[02:47:08.099 --> 02:47:17.284]  They mentioned it briefly but they haven't really mentioned the implications of what that means.
[02:47:17.304 --> 02:47:30.210]  I think there's a bit of a rift in society and how people are reacting because I look on the internet and young people who are more news savvy
[02:47:30.926 --> 02:47:35.570]  Are like sending messages to each other on the message board saying, uh, I've already run away.
[02:47:35.650 --> 02:47:38.712]  I'm in, uh, I'm, uh, I'm in Western Japan.
[02:47:38.752 --> 02:47:40.413]  I've gone to this prefecture and stuff.
[02:47:40.834 --> 02:47:51.182]  But the older generation who would just get the news from television or whatever are slightly, uh, they're not really aware of what really is happening.
[02:47:51.342 --> 02:47:54.044]  Yeah, they're in that television induced trance.
[02:47:54.304 --> 02:47:56.486]  Uh, David, anything else you'd like to add from Japan?
[02:47:57.901 --> 02:48:10.293]  Well, just on some of the larger trends that were happening before this disaster happened, this disaster I think is just, it's totally, it's completely changed Japan's future and the path they're on.
[02:48:10.794 --> 02:48:20.203]  Because, this is my own observation, but in the Japanese media before this disaster, there was a lot of media
[02:48:22.733 --> 02:48:25.574]  Pointing towards like a new national fervor.
[02:48:26.055 --> 02:48:28.516]  There was a television drama.
[02:48:28.796 --> 02:48:36.659]  Yeah, new optimism, new optimism was back and you're saying after the decade-long recession, you're saying this may knock that on the head.
[02:48:37.880 --> 02:48:45.323]  Well, specifically just before this disaster happened, there was a quote from Kevin Maher, the policy chief on affairs at the U.S.
[02:48:45.443 --> 02:48:46.223]  State Department.
[02:48:46.849 --> 02:48:50.211]  And he said, this is the quote, it would be bad for the U.S.
[02:48:50.471 --> 02:48:57.095]  if Japan's war-renouncing peaceful constitution was changed because Japan would not need the American military.
[02:48:57.495 --> 02:49:01.478]  And then he went on... That's right, they were getting a little more militaristic as a China and North Korea.
[02:49:01.798 --> 02:49:03.499]  Are you saying that this is suspicious?
[02:49:05.582 --> 02:49:09.345]  I don't know because I'm not a scientist.
[02:49:09.485 --> 02:49:12.608]  Well, David, very well said and we appreciate your call from Japan.
[02:49:12.628 --> 02:49:13.488]  We're going to move on now.
[02:49:13.548 --> 02:49:14.729]  Thank you so much for calling.
[02:49:15.049 --> 02:49:15.930]  Will in New York.
[02:49:16.010 --> 02:49:16.811]  Will, you're on the air.
[02:49:20.189 --> 02:49:23.934]  I got a question I really want to ask you, but first I just want to point out a couple small things.
[02:49:24.535 --> 02:49:29.061]  For anyone on the East Coast who knows that 9-11 was an inside job, tomorrow in Washington D.C.
[02:49:29.101 --> 02:49:30.884]  there's going to be an anti-war protest.
[02:49:31.344 --> 02:49:34.949]  So I suggest that people, if they can make it down, head down there and talk about this.
[02:49:36.471 --> 02:49:38.813]  Also, uh, Shoemaker-Levy hit Jupiter.
[02:49:38.853 --> 02:49:40.154]  I just wanted to point that out.
[02:49:40.194 --> 02:49:41.275]  Jupiter, Saturn, whatever.
[02:49:41.295 --> 02:49:42.896]  The big comet that hit the gas giant.
[02:49:42.936 --> 02:49:43.817]  I'm live here on air.
[02:49:43.857 --> 02:49:46.239]  I say a lot of stuff wrong, sometimes getting it backwards.
[02:49:46.259 --> 02:49:51.523]  But the point is, the Earth gets hit by more big objects than what they previously thought on a more frequent basis.
[02:49:52.544 --> 02:49:52.844]  I hear you.
[02:49:52.984 --> 02:49:54.125]  No, I just want, you know, whatever.
[02:49:54.385 --> 02:49:56.327]  Uh, but... No, thanks for correcting me.
[02:49:57.488 --> 02:50:03.953]  I wanted to, uh, I wanted to ask you, I know you say you don't like to get into the alien stuff, uh, but how do you feel about
[02:50:04.522 --> 02:50:16.630]  What Jim Marth said about the reason for invading Iraq, he thinks, is to get at these ancient tablets that have to do with... Well, we know that that was an added goody to rob the antiquities.
[02:50:16.670 --> 02:50:17.551]  I appreciate your call.
[02:50:18.712 --> 02:50:20.933]  I just don't get into things I can't prove one way or the other.
[02:50:21.253 --> 02:50:23.115]  Aliens and things are really not my purview.
[02:50:23.135 --> 02:50:26.157]  I mean, I can't get folks to admit that radiation is bad for them.
[02:50:26.217 --> 02:50:28.278]  Ann Coulter is saying it's good for you today.
[02:50:28.578 --> 02:50:29.519]  I'm not joking, folks.
[02:50:32.950 --> 02:50:41.294]  My point is, is that now they can study Jupiter, Saturn, other planets, and they know that more meteors and comets hit planets on a more frequent basis than they thought.
[02:50:42.494 --> 02:50:48.297]  And we'll look up Shoemaker-Levy a little bit later, but the point is, I get live on air and talk for three, four hours a day, sometimes I get things wrong.
[02:50:48.837 --> 02:50:49.698]  But thank you for correcting me.
[02:50:49.718 --> 02:50:51.018]  All right, I'm going to try to jam in.
[02:50:51.179 --> 02:50:52.759]  Jennifer, Sean, Mike, Daniel.
[02:50:53.079 --> 02:50:54.640]  Daniel in Australia on the other side.
[02:50:54.660 --> 02:50:56.801]  We'll go a little bit into overdrive in the next hour.
[02:50:56.821 --> 02:51:00.403]  I have a key announcement as well, dealing with potassium iodine on the other side.
[02:51:00.723 --> 02:51:02.704]  The collapse of the dollar is imminent.
[02:51:03.064 --> 02:51:07.106]  You can protect your wealth by buying gold, silver, and strong foreign currencies.
[02:51:07.226 --> 02:51:13.769]  But what if the government confiscates your precious metals, implements exchange controls, or nationalizes your retirement?
[02:51:13.949 --> 02:51:15.150]  You need a backup plan.
[02:51:15.230 --> 02:51:19.032]  That's why you must move your wealth into an offshore asset protection structure.
[02:51:19.212 --> 02:51:31.883]  Go to CollapseProof.com to get your free special report and discover how to store your gold and silver in the world's safest vaults, or how to hold foreign currencies in a way that's safe from bank failures, bank runs, or exchange controls.
[02:51:32.083 --> 02:51:32.764]  Learn how the U.S.
[02:51:32.784 --> 02:51:39.309]  government failed to collect a $36 million claim because the defendant legally used an offshore asset protection program.
[02:51:39.389 --> 02:51:44.794]  This is what you need to keep your wealth safe when the dollar collapses, and CollapseProof.com can help.
[02:51:45.054 --> 02:51:45.655]  America, you've been warned.
[02:52:06.411 --> 02:52:07.412]  We're good to go.
[02:52:33.909 --> 02:52:39.972]  He was among the first to predict the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:52:40.172 --> 02:52:42.733]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:52:42.993 --> 02:52:46.235]  If you haven't taken time to watch this free video, do it right now.
[02:52:46.415 --> 02:52:48.536]  You may never think about America the same way again.

[02:54:01.059 --> 02:54:06.680]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:54:07.441 --> 02:54:13.002]  We're going a little bit into overdrive into the fourth hour so I can get to Daniel, Jennifer, Sean, Mike, and Fred.
[02:54:13.542 --> 02:54:21.345]  One program note, I began looking for potassium iodine, the medical type, for my crew, for my extended family.
[02:54:23.085 --> 02:54:29.887]  Because the stuff I had was the regular tablets and was expired, though I consulted with some physicians.
[02:54:29.907 --> 02:54:31.228]  They said it should still probably be good.
[02:54:31.848 --> 02:54:40.911]  And I found a place in Texas I'd known about for 12 years and interviewed, a place that calibrates for the government, the Geiger counters and the rest of it, who had a limited supply.
[02:54:40.951 --> 02:54:42.271]  We bought everything they had left.
[02:54:43.072 --> 02:54:45.072]  I don't think it'll probably be there in four or five hours.
[02:54:45.152 --> 02:54:46.092]  It's selling that fast.
[02:54:46.213 --> 02:54:47.393]  The main shopping cart
[02:54:48.843 --> 02:54:49.883]  is basically down.
[02:54:50.043 --> 02:54:51.224]  People are trying to order on it.
[02:54:51.304 --> 02:54:52.224]  Some of that's going through.
[02:54:52.244 --> 02:54:54.905]  You need to go to our Yahoo!
[02:54:55.045 --> 02:54:59.467]  backup card that's linked in the article up on InfoWars.com.
[02:54:59.487 --> 02:55:03.408]  You want to go to our old shopping cart in the article at InfoWars.com.
[02:55:04.875 --> 02:55:11.137]  Where we, the title Infowars has obtained some of the only potassium iodine left in the country.
[02:55:11.457 --> 02:55:15.898]  We've added a link there to the Yahoo cart or at the top of Infowars.com where it says shopping.
[02:55:16.298 --> 02:55:18.539]  It'll say new cart and it'll say classic cart.
[02:55:18.879 --> 02:55:25.601]  Click on the classic cart if you want to be able to get it but it might be gone in an hour or two and I wish there was more.
[02:55:25.941 --> 02:55:29.342]  We've also gotten some radiation detectors but I could only afford to get a hundred of them.
[02:55:30.282 --> 02:55:30.602]  Yeah.
[02:55:52.018 --> 02:55:53.039]  The phones are just jammed.
[02:55:53.079 --> 02:55:54.200]  We can't take orders that way.
[02:55:54.580 --> 02:55:56.441]  Infowars.com.
[02:55:56.862 --> 02:55:58.243]  And yes, the listener was right.
[02:55:58.263 --> 02:56:02.906]  When I'm babbling about comets hitting planets more often than they thought and things, it was not Saturn.
[02:56:02.926 --> 02:56:06.629]  It was Jupiter that was hit by comet Shoemaker-Levy.
[02:56:06.689 --> 02:56:07.689]  That's the folks that found it.
[02:56:08.610 --> 02:56:11.832]  And blew holes in the side of the gas giant bigger than the planet Earth.
[02:56:12.313 --> 02:56:13.914]  So that was the point I made earlier about
[02:56:14.474 --> 02:56:17.975]  Big calamities happening in the solar system more often than scientists previously thought.
[02:56:18.895 --> 02:56:22.356]  Let's go, now that they can watch the solar system and see what's happening and what's floating around out there.
[02:56:23.256 --> 02:56:25.236]  Let's go to Daniel, and we've got to move quick now.
[02:56:25.316 --> 02:56:26.617]  Daniel in Australia, go ahead.
[02:56:27.877 --> 02:56:28.797]  Hi Alex, how are you?
[02:56:29.297 --> 02:56:29.497]  Good.
[02:56:30.978 --> 02:56:33.038]  Hey, thanks very much for helping keep us informed, mate.
[02:56:33.878 --> 02:56:34.278]  Thank you.
[02:56:34.778 --> 02:56:37.419]  We're getting massive conflicting reports from the media.
[02:56:38.139 --> 02:56:42.280]  The Japanese, I lived over there for some time and I can speak your language, so...
[02:56:42.970 --> 02:56:44.751]  I'm understanding the news reports there.
[02:56:45.632 --> 02:56:47.933]  They sort of, they communicate between the lines now.
[02:56:48.674 --> 02:56:52.836]  They are letting us know what's going on, as well as telling us that it's all okay.
[02:56:52.856 --> 02:56:56.078]  Yeah, they're saying the radiation's so high it can kill you, but everything's fine.
[02:56:57.179 --> 02:56:57.659]  That's right.
[02:56:58.680 --> 02:57:07.185]  The Japanese Prime Minister, Kan, he'll come up and he'll say, look, it's gotten terrible over the last, you know, day.
[02:57:07.945 --> 02:57:10.167]  It's as bad as it can get, but it's just getting better.
[02:57:10.187 --> 02:57:11.988]  It's just gotten better.
[02:57:12.788 --> 02:57:13.528]  Every time he speaks.
[02:57:16.750 --> 02:57:18.911]  Well, I mean, do you blame them?
[02:57:19.011 --> 02:57:29.376]  I'm not saying it's good what they're doing, but 37 million people in Tokyo, as the winds turn south, as they're reported to be forecast to do, can you imagine what a panic could do?
[02:57:30.957 --> 02:57:39.381]  Yeah, look, for those who are aware of what's going on and keep themselves informed, they're giving enough information for people to know.
[02:57:40.446 --> 02:57:40.987]  I think?
[02:57:56.397 --> 02:58:01.982]  That is what they're saying and now they've had the head of the plant break down and cry and say it's deadly, it's deadly.
[02:58:02.642 --> 02:58:06.926]  That is certainly probably not going to increase confidence on the island of Japan.
[02:58:06.946 --> 02:58:10.929]  Of course, some of that stuff's going southerly towards your country.
[02:58:11.450 --> 02:58:12.971]  What is your media saying in Australia?
[02:58:14.423 --> 02:58:17.664]  I don't think it's a real threat for us.
[02:58:17.764 --> 02:58:21.325]  I think you guys are in the fallout zone of whatever's happening.
[02:58:21.345 --> 02:58:23.486]  Well, there's no doubt we're in a worse position.
[02:58:23.846 --> 02:58:24.826]  I appreciate your call.
[02:58:24.846 --> 02:58:27.487]  We're going to come back and take some more calls on the other side.
[02:58:27.507 --> 02:58:30.427]  And then, of course, I'll be back this Sunday live, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:58:30.467 --> 02:58:34.068]  Central, 5 to 7, that is, Eastern.
[02:58:34.829 --> 02:58:35.769]  But please stay with us.
[02:58:35.789 --> 02:58:39.310]  We'll continue to track all of this and the ongoing buildup for invasion of Libya.
[02:58:44.284 --> 02:58:48.265]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:58:50.786 --> 02:58:52.387]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:58:52.427 --> 02:58:55.248]  You've heard me talk about Cal Bend 5 Star Soaps for years.
[02:58:55.808 --> 02:59:00.730]  This is an American made product of the highest quality and compares to nothing you will find in stores.

[02:59:10.955 --> 02:59:11.916]  Take my word for it.
[02:59:12.096 --> 02:59:14.438]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[02:59:14.759 --> 02:59:20.964]  Since 1947, Calvin's Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.

[02:59:49.068 --> 02:59:49.508]  Thank you.
[02:59:51.529 --> 02:59:52.690]  Coast to Coast.
[02:59:53.050 --> 02:59:54.511]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.091 --> 02:59:58.313]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:07.000 --> 03:00:16.028]  Alright, final live segment, then we go into key retransmission where you break everything down and have a radiation expert on, then Dr. Nick Baggage, then of course you heard Bob Chapman earlier in the last hour.
[03:00:16.548 --> 03:00:20.552]  That's coming up on the restreams at Infowars.com and re-airing on stations all over the country.
[03:00:21.052 --> 03:00:22.654]  But let's move quickly to some final calls.
[03:00:22.694 --> 03:00:25.916]  Jennifer in Colorado, and then Sean, Mike and Fred if we have time.
[03:00:25.936 --> 03:00:27.578]  Jennifer, you've got the floor, quickly.
[03:00:29.139 --> 03:00:30.700]  Thank you, Alex, for everything you do.
[03:00:31.320 --> 03:00:39.565]  We live in Denver, Colorado, and we were just wondering, will the Rocky Mountains provide any protection for us with the radiation that's coming this way?
[03:00:39.905 --> 03:00:54.174]  I'm not a meteorologist, but I've studied what they said, but undoubtedly, yes, it'll be a lot more diluted and statistically a lower chance of not just the background radiation, but when you actually get one of the particles itself, it's higher level radiation, you know, it lowers that chance of inhalation.
[03:00:55.566 --> 03:00:57.128]  Okay, and one other question.
[03:00:57.228 --> 03:01:01.574]  What are the immediate warning signs we should be looking for right before they claim martial law?
[03:01:02.534 --> 03:01:04.015]  They'll never really declare martial law.
[03:01:04.035 --> 03:01:05.677]  They'll call it a civil emergency.
[03:01:06.077 --> 03:01:09.900]  Michigan declared financial martial law, which means suspension of normal laws.
[03:01:10.721 --> 03:01:21.630]  And under the executive orders, under the TSA not caring what Congress says, the EPA not caring what Congress says, shutting down coal plants, that's all executive fiat martial law.
[03:01:21.650 --> 03:01:28.116]  So it's a slow slide into the just civil emergency national security state, Jennifer.
[03:01:29.355 --> 03:01:30.616]  Okay, thank you so much, Alex.
[03:01:30.796 --> 03:01:31.536]  Thank you, Jennifer.
[03:01:31.877 --> 03:01:33.217]  Yeah, look at all these other third world countries.
[03:01:33.278 --> 03:01:34.919]  It's always an emergency, a civil emergency.
[03:01:34.939 --> 03:01:36.039]  They don't call it martial law.
[03:01:36.059 --> 03:01:38.001]  People are like, Alex, where's the martial law?
[03:01:38.381 --> 03:01:40.722]  I don't know, the TSA is running checkpoints on highways everywhere.
[03:01:40.742 --> 03:01:43.224]  I don't know, they're putting troops on the streets more and more.
[03:01:43.424 --> 03:01:44.885]  They're sticking their hands down your pants.
[03:01:45.465 --> 03:01:49.948]  I don't know, they're suspending regular laws on your pension funds and things.
[03:01:50.308 --> 03:01:51.629]  I mean, what do you think that is?
[03:01:52.570 --> 03:01:54.571]  Let's go ahead and talk to Sean in Canada.
[03:01:54.931 --> 03:01:55.772]  Sean, you're on the air.
[03:01:57.756 --> 03:01:58.356]  Hello, Alex.
[03:01:58.637 --> 03:01:59.097]  Can you hear me?
[03:01:59.157 --> 03:01:59.577]  Yes, sir.
[03:02:00.818 --> 03:02:01.239]  Well, okay.
[03:02:01.279 --> 03:02:04.821]  Well, I have some information concerning the Pickering nuclear power plant.
[03:02:04.841 --> 03:02:08.104]  Had a leak just a few days ago there into Lake Ontario.
[03:02:08.184 --> 03:02:08.924]  Yep, they admit it.
[03:02:08.944 --> 03:02:12.146]  A lot of radiation got released and they say it's not bad for you.
[03:02:13.127 --> 03:02:13.327]  Yep.
[03:02:13.487 --> 03:02:14.748]  Absolutely, yeah.
[03:02:14.989 --> 03:02:18.691]  The radioactive, it was called tritium that was in the water that was released.
[03:02:18.731 --> 03:02:21.613]  About 73,000 liters was put into Lake Ontario.
[03:02:22.054 --> 03:02:25.116]  As we both know, we share 50-50 pretty much with America.
[03:02:26.445 --> 03:02:29.367]  Now, the half-life of tritium is about 12 years.
[03:02:29.427 --> 03:02:32.448]  In the human body, it's about 7 to 14 days, according to this.
[03:02:33.048 --> 03:02:35.809]  What's interesting, actually, is the legal limits.
[03:02:36.410 --> 03:02:39.151]  We talk about cover-ups and think about how people sort of spin news.
[03:02:40.251 --> 03:02:52.036]  The Canadian legal limit for tritium in drinking water is 7,000 becquerel per litre, so that's the radioactive rating per litre of the water, while the United States is only 740.
[03:02:53.499 --> 03:02:56.482]  That's a difference of over 6,000 Becquerel per liter.
[03:02:56.622 --> 03:03:01.887]  Yeah, the government just says this radiation isn't bad for you, and Amculture says it's good for you.
[03:03:03.409 --> 03:03:04.690]  It's good for you, yeah, right.
[03:03:04.730 --> 03:03:05.371]  No, I'm not kidding.
[03:03:05.411 --> 03:03:06.572]  Show a document cam shot.
[03:03:07.653 --> 03:03:08.955]  Sorry, go ahead.
[03:03:09.195 --> 03:03:11.237]  The World Health Organization puts it at 10,000 Bq per liter.
[03:03:13.959 --> 03:03:19.903]  Well, the European Union has an investigative limit of only 100 BQ per liter.
[03:03:20.103 --> 03:03:21.984]  I just see a great discrepancy there.
[03:03:22.004 --> 03:03:22.985]  I thought I would bring that up.
[03:03:23.185 --> 03:03:23.766]  No, you're right.
[03:03:23.806 --> 03:03:25.587]  And notice how it's not getting hardly any play.
[03:03:25.607 --> 03:03:27.508]  And this is a major radiation release.
[03:03:27.868 --> 03:03:30.430]  And they're caught covering this up at plants all the time.
[03:03:30.770 --> 03:03:34.973]  That's why I'm so adverse more and more to nuclear power as we learn more.
[03:03:35.734 --> 03:03:36.294]  But don't worry.
[03:03:36.354 --> 03:03:41.417]  Ann Coulter is now a, I guess, a nuclear physicist and a chemist and a biologist.
[03:03:41.477 --> 03:03:43.539]  And she says a glowing report on radiation.
[03:03:44.079 --> 03:03:49.441]  Anyone exposed to excess radiation from the nuclear power plants is now probably much less likely to get cancer.
[03:03:49.862 --> 03:03:57.185]  Really, the Japanese government's having to break down and people are breaking down crying, saying it's killing people and gonna kill people, but maybe to her, death is good.
[03:03:57.205 --> 03:03:58.645]  I mean, I appreciate your call, sir.
[03:03:58.906 --> 03:04:00.506]  And I'm not even here to bash Ann Coulter.
[03:04:00.546 --> 03:04:01.167]  I don't even care.
[03:04:01.187 --> 03:04:03.868]  You know, she says Ron Paul's good, but...
[03:04:05.310 --> 03:04:07.531]  Is a blind hog, you know, still finds acorns?
[03:04:07.691 --> 03:04:09.572]  I mean, I'm just insulted by this.
[03:04:09.972 --> 03:04:11.353]  It's not a joke, man.
[03:04:12.114 --> 03:04:18.857]  And the cynicism of the liberals, the cynicism of mainline Republicans, and just the giggling and snickering and not taking things serious.
[03:04:20.018 --> 03:04:22.339]  Radiation's now been detected in Southern California.
[03:04:23.442 --> 03:04:24.923]  Just from the small leaks Friday.
[03:04:25.183 --> 03:04:26.363]  That stuff just got here today.
[03:04:27.083 --> 03:04:29.124]  All those big explosions and plumes.
[03:04:29.604 --> 03:04:33.926]  If the little stuff from Friday got here, what's going to happen in the next five, six days?
[03:04:34.646 --> 03:04:36.367]  And after that, as this just continues.
[03:04:37.227 --> 03:04:39.428]  I mean, they're in the mainline news.
[03:04:39.468 --> 03:04:43.249]  It's up on DrugsReport.com, Infowars.com, LA Times, you name it.
[03:04:43.709 --> 03:04:46.630]  Saying they may just pull the workers out entirely because it's so deadly.
[03:04:47.170 --> 03:04:51.112]  And just let the whole thing continue to melt down and smokestack towards us.
[03:04:51.992 --> 03:04:54.295]  And the media, a lot of them just laugh and think it's funny.
[03:04:54.776 --> 03:04:56.098]  Key info coming up straight ahead.
[03:04:56.118 --> 03:04:57.580]  See you back Sunday live, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:04:57.620 --> 03:04:58.441]  Great job crew.
[03:04:58.461 --> 03:05:00.785]  Pray for America, pray for Japan, pray for Canada.
