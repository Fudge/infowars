[00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.834]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:08.474 --> 00:00:09.275]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.056 --> 00:00:10.957]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:11.598 --> 00:00:15.302]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:15.802 --> 00:00:19.867]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.711 --> 00:00:27.075]  We are fully loaded with information warfare weapons.
[00:00:27.135 --> 00:00:35.124]  We are over the target, the military industrial complex owned by the big criminal offshore banks trying to destroy
[00:00:35.885 --> 00:00:40.271]  Human free society and on its asses build their world government.
[00:00:40.331 --> 00:00:43.014]  We are resisting it big time.
[00:00:43.074 --> 00:00:45.678]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:45.798 --> 00:00:49.643]  It is Tuesday the first day of February 2011.
[00:00:52.386 --> 00:00:55.067]  And we're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:55.107 --> 00:01:04.452]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny pops in later in the next hour with an update on flu vaccines and other vaccines and adverse reaction reports all over the world.
[00:01:05.272 --> 00:01:12.576]  David Icke, to give us his interesting perspective, joins us in the third hour on what's happening with the global economy, what's going on in the Middle East.
[00:01:13.949 --> 00:01:33.979]  uh... in jordan the monarchy has replaced the government in reaction to protest uh... that again is a big ally of the uh... west uh... so there is certainly a real rebellion going on here and i think what's really happening is the west has got its pre-placed people knowing that there's rebellion against all of these dictatorial
[00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:35.539]  I think?
[00:01:57.011 --> 00:02:07.145]  Deprivation that's going on predominantly over dollar devaluation globally driving up food prices on a planetary scale.
[00:02:07.545 --> 00:02:10.169]  So we're going to be discussing all of that today.
[00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.112]  The latest on what's happening in Egypt.
[00:02:13.803 --> 00:02:26.496]  We're also going to get into people like the new governor of California says that they must raise taxes or California could go the way of what's happening in Egypt.
[00:02:26.896 --> 00:02:29.859]  It's actually overtaxation that's hurting California.
[00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:32.982]  No one can deny that and causing people to flee.
[00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:40.472]  the state, like they're fleeing Michigan, New York, and other big tax and spend areas, like Illinois.
[00:02:40.492 --> 00:02:43.273]  So we're going to be breaking that down today.
[00:02:44.373 --> 00:03:02.098]  Also, there's an interesting article here out of the San Diego News today, and its document shows safety concerns, slowed fluoridation, and reading this article, basically there is a rebellion going on inside
[00:03:03.336 --> 00:03:28.009]  The San Diego government, this is out of the San Diego Union Tribune, their big paper, where their own scientists are saying, don't put this in the water, you know it's toxic, you know it's dangerous, and so there's been an internal fight inside the city, and that's why they're several months late on putting this stuff into the water supply, but because of federal funds, greasing the skids, they're going ahead with that.
[00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:45.860]  And speaking of health care, obviously, judge rules against health care law yesterday and cites in his 70 plus page paper in the ruling Obama on CNN and other debates, but predominantly a CNN debate where Obama said, hey, we can't make people get health care.
[00:03:46.381 --> 00:03:49.223]  You know, can we make people buy houses so they're not going to be homeless?
[00:03:50.403 --> 00:03:53.364]  Uh, and the judge went on to say, yeah, can you make people eat broccoli?
[00:03:53.725 --> 00:03:56.045]  Well, that's what this authoritarianism is.
[00:03:56.066 --> 00:04:09.211]  If they can tell you what type of toilet you're going to have, if they can tell you what type of light bulb you're going to have, sounds reasonable, then it's what type of house you can live in, how many children you can have, how much carbon dioxide you can exhale.
[00:04:10.848 --> 00:04:17.490]  This is the authoritarian 21st century model of all of this, and so that's coming up as well.
[00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.031]  Obviously, we have this up at Infowars.com.
[00:04:21.532 --> 00:04:22.772]  It's also up on Drudge Report.
[00:04:23.512 --> 00:04:28.314]  Chuckie Schumer came out a couple days ago and said that there are three branches of government.
[00:04:28.794 --> 00:04:32.815]  The House, the Senate, and the Executive.
[00:04:32.835 --> 00:04:35.176]  Of course, that's two branches of government.
[00:04:35.576 --> 00:04:39.758]  He listed the Legislative and bifurcated it into two.
[00:04:40.984 --> 00:04:45.409]  Two branches of government along with the executive ignored the judicial.
[00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.132]  So we're going to be getting into that clip.
[00:04:47.372 --> 00:04:56.623]  Also, the environmentalists, the fake environmentalists, are running around claiming the freezing weather is a response to global warming.
[00:04:57.044 --> 00:04:58.446]  But don't worry, you can pay them taxes.
[00:04:58.846 --> 00:05:02.307]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[00:05:02.687 --> 00:05:06.729]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:11.991]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[00:05:12.051 --> 00:05:16.853]  Not looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[00:05:17.593 --> 00:05:24.616]  Not worried about them moving south, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[00:05:27.385 --> 00:05:31.130]  I'm looking for America.
[00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.774]  Wear American and be proud.
[00:05:34.874 --> 00:05:37.277]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[00:05:37.297 --> 00:05:41.061]  Land of the free and the home of the brave.
[00:05:41.081 --> 00:05:45.526]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[00:05:53.351 --> 00:05:57.974]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[00:05:58.975 --> 00:06:02.277]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:06:02.557 --> 00:06:03.618]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:06:03.678 --> 00:06:08.041]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:06:08.241 --> 00:06:13.905]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:06:14.186 --> 00:06:16.187]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:06:16.347 --> 00:06:19.009]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[00:06:19.369 --> 00:06:25.673]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[00:06:25.853 --> 00:06:27.674]  They both make fabulous investments.
[00:06:28.075 --> 00:06:33.158]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[00:06:33.418 --> 00:06:38.361]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[00:06:38.681 --> 00:06:43.887]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious easy fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[00:06:44.067 --> 00:06:47.030]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:50.213]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[00:06:50.233 --> 00:06:51.034]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[00:06:58.301 --> 00:06:59.443]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:06:59.483 --> 00:07:06.150]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:08.712]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:07:08.972 --> 00:07:14.138]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:07:14.338 --> 00:07:17.119]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:07:17.379 --> 00:07:19.479]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:07:19.699 --> 00:07:25.620]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:29.141]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:07:29.321 --> 00:07:34.842]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:07:35.102 --> 00:07:36.422]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:07:36.742 --> 00:07:37.902]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:07:38.042 --> 00:07:40.583]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:07:40.723 --> 00:07:42.123]  He explains everything you need to know.
[00:07:42.403 --> 00:07:44.764]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:07:44.924 --> 00:07:49.425]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:07:49.565 --> 00:07:52.006]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[00:07:52.146 --> 00:07:55.867]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:07:56.007 --> 00:07:57.748]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:08:00.389 --> 00:08:06.411]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:07.031 --> 00:08:10.012]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:12.162 --> 00:08:12.962]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:08:13.042 --> 00:08:13.643]  Welcome again.
[00:08:13.703 --> 00:08:14.603]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:08:14.683 --> 00:08:19.366]  It is the first day of February 2011 on this Tuesday edition.
[00:08:19.386 --> 00:08:37.235]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny will be popping in for about 15-20 minutes at the start of the next hour to give us an update on some of the vaccine reactions that are happening and the latest on the globalist attempt to establish forced inoculation all across this country but also worldwide.
[00:08:38.015 --> 00:08:42.659]  And the rest of the broadcast will be dealing with news and information.
[00:08:43.139 --> 00:08:44.180]  There is a lot of it.
[00:08:45.121 --> 00:08:48.664]  First off, I want to get into Obama and the government health care plan.
[00:08:48.684 --> 00:08:51.266]  And I want to go back to a video.
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:09:03.168]  During the debates with Hillary, where he said, look, you can't make people buy health insurance just like you can't make people buy a home so they won't be homeless.
[00:09:03.948 --> 00:09:05.810]  And you can't have penalties on people.
[00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:14.416]  Well, he went ahead and of course later went along with all that, but the federal judge in this latest ruling cited Obama's own statements.
[00:09:15.277 --> 00:09:18.940]  And the judge went on to say, you can't make people eat broccoli.
[00:09:19.724 --> 00:09:22.385]  I mean, if the government can do this, they can make you eat broccoli.
[00:09:22.925 --> 00:09:24.165]  Well, that's the whole point.
[00:09:24.205 --> 00:09:27.626]  They are deciding what type of light bulbs we can have, what type of toilets.
[00:09:27.966 --> 00:09:30.506]  They're openly saying they want to decide how many kids we can have.
[00:09:30.986 --> 00:09:35.347]  This is the nature of a command-and-control planned society.
[00:09:36.007 --> 00:09:37.507]  Command-and-controlled society.
[00:09:38.488 --> 00:09:45.149]  Also, they have the Federation of American Scientists, and the woman could hardly say it with a straight face.
[00:09:47.157 --> 00:09:59.086]  on CNN saying that the freezing weather we're seeing as a result of global warming and all of the evil carbon dioxide that we're putting into the atmosphere.
[00:09:59.426 --> 00:10:00.206]  That's coming up.
[00:10:00.647 --> 00:10:04.289]  We have Chuckie Schumer not knowing the three branches of government.
[00:10:04.809 --> 00:10:14.756]  You know, I tend to think he does know the three branches, but they like to practice ignorance out in front of everyone, basically washing the public's minds in disinformation.
[00:10:14.836 --> 00:10:14.916]  It's
[00:10:15.697 --> 00:10:33.121]  Part of the globalist religion to put out disinfo and to keep the general public in the dark so that we just swim in a sea of disinformation so that we're confused and can't ever wrest control of society away from these bloodthirsty control freaks.
[00:10:33.621 --> 00:10:36.722]  So that is all coming up as well.
[00:10:37.402 --> 00:10:42.823]  Obviously we're going to be getting into the Egypt situation and the one and only David Eichel will be live with us.
[00:10:43.603 --> 00:10:57.010]  In the last hour of the broadcast today, but first I wanted to get into some very good news and this is out of the major newspaper in San Diego
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:10.797]  And the San Diego newspaper, the San Diego Union Tribune, has the headline here, Documents Show Safety Concerns Slowed Floridation.
[00:11:11.417 --> 00:11:13.841]  Now the headline should be, Revolt Within the City.
[00:11:15.063 --> 00:11:30.261]  Because as you read deeper into the article, it says that scientists and people working in the health department were concerned about the fact that EPA scientists, FDA scientists have testified in Congress
[00:11:31.022 --> 00:11:46.959]  They admit children are getting way too much fluoride, that it's in the food, that it's in, it's used as a pesticide on the different crops, and that we're bioaccumulating it, and that it's very, very toxic, and that the type of fluoride they're putting in the water is toxic.
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.922]  But the article kind of spins it that, well,
[00:11:51.038 --> 00:12:00.626]  What's happened here is, there were some safety concerns, and so this was supposed to happen a few months ago, but now, now San Diego, the biggest city in the U.S.
[00:12:00.646 --> 00:12:02.968]  to not fluoridate, they're moving to put it in.
[00:12:03.468 --> 00:12:06.430]  San Antonio only put fluoride in six, seven years ago.
[00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:08.852]  I mean, the people there aren't stupid.
[00:12:09.453 --> 00:12:13.156]  It's taken the government since the 1950s until now to fluoridate 71% of this country.
[00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:17.480]  Just a few years ago it was 68%.
[00:12:18.761 --> 00:12:21.341]  And they've got close to 70% in England fluoridated.
[00:12:21.361 --> 00:12:23.762]  They've got more than half in Germany fluoridated.
[00:12:24.362 --> 00:12:26.823]  And again, it's not because they care about you.
[00:12:26.903 --> 00:12:28.043]  It reduces fertility.
[00:12:28.943 --> 00:12:30.184]  It causes brain damage.
[00:12:30.944 --> 00:12:32.284]  It causes bone cancer.
[00:12:32.344 --> 00:12:33.464]  This is not debated.
[00:12:33.884 --> 00:12:35.205]  The government admits this.
[00:12:35.785 --> 00:12:37.385]  But they hope you don't look into it.
[00:12:37.445 --> 00:12:39.626]  But think about how we have these facts.
[00:12:41.226 --> 00:13:04.165]  And all we've got to do is continue to present them at city council, present them at county commissioners, present them at the state houses, and turn the power of the grassroots loose against the big chemical company lobbies, who would have to store all this toxic waste, but voila, they sell it to you as a health benefit, and now they don't have to store the toxic waste, they can put it directly
[00:13:04.645 --> 00:13:06.206]  into your water.
[00:13:06.526 --> 00:13:12.649]  And what's so deadly about sodium fluoride for the medical doctors we've talked to and the endocrinologists and others is that it's an adjuvant.
[00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:24.416]  It accelerates and supercharges all the other toxins and chemicals and free radicals and grignard reagents that are already in the water that are added along with the sodium fluoride.
[00:13:24.676 --> 00:13:25.716]  That's another big hoax.
[00:13:26.017 --> 00:13:32.340]  You're told this is pharmacological, you know, pharma-grade fluoride, sodium fluoride.
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:32.860]  No, it's not.
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:33.781]  And you do need
[00:13:34.341 --> 00:13:38.023]  Just tiny trace amounts of calcium fluoride.
[00:13:39.344 --> 00:13:41.766]  You need tiny trace amounts of lead and mercury.
[00:13:42.186 --> 00:13:53.212]  These are way above those tiny, tiny trace amounts and it's a key compound that bioaccumulates over time in the tissues, in the organs and the bones.
[00:13:53.833 --> 00:13:55.034]  But you can go read this article.
[00:13:55.994 --> 00:14:04.077]  Utility officials said the slowdown highlights how the safety system worked, though the documents suggest some city leaders were disturbed by the timing of the deferral.
[00:14:04.937 --> 00:14:18.901]  San Diego was three days away from starting fluoridation in December 22nd when senior operator and supervisor Jim McVeigh said the schedule had precluded hands-on training by system operators before the process went live.
[00:14:22.708 --> 00:14:33.241]  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently updated information about the fluoridation of water, saying that it actually causes dental fluorosis and should be cut from one...
[00:14:34.073 --> 00:14:37.136]  Point two parts per million to 0.7 parts.
[00:14:37.777 --> 00:14:41.380]  So they're certainly starting to back off on that front.
[00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:44.303]  So good news there to people in San Diego.
[00:14:44.684 --> 00:14:47.406]  Just continue to put pressure on government and get the facts out.
[00:14:47.767 --> 00:14:48.708]  You can reverse this.
[00:14:48.728 --> 00:14:52.612]  They've tried to just laugh at people for 60 years who bring up the medical science.
[00:14:53.072 --> 00:14:56.516]  It was scientists and doctors that brought it up back in the 50s and said it was dangerous.
[00:14:56.996 --> 00:15:02.623]  And they've been laughing at us for all these decades, but now the mountains of evidence are crushing their lives.
[00:15:02.963 --> 00:15:05.506]  And so victory is in our hands if we just take it.
[00:15:07.028 --> 00:15:10.792]  Now, speaking of health care, what it's like to have a government
[00:15:12.073 --> 00:15:12.253]  I think?
[00:15:30.663 --> 00:15:35.906]  Believe that who are on the left that they're actually helping someone.
[00:15:36.266 --> 00:15:41.489]  But the truth is the big banks that own the insurance companies on record wrote the health care plan.
[00:15:41.829 --> 00:15:42.449]  They wrote it.
[00:15:42.609 --> 00:15:43.470]  They created it.
[00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:45.411]  And they pushed it out there.
[00:15:45.911 --> 00:15:52.415]  And it's got mandates to give you multi thousand dollar a year fines if you don't go out and get it to attach your paycheck.
[00:15:53.450 --> 00:16:04.377]  And it allows the big insurance companies that control the HMOs to write policy through a computer telling your doctor, your dentist, what procedure they can do.
[00:16:04.957 --> 00:16:10.221]  So the bureaucracy diagnosing you, in quote, cost-cutting.
[00:16:10.341 --> 00:16:16.244]  Once they socialize things, once they get us dependent on each other, then they can have social control.
[00:16:16.665 --> 00:16:17.866]  They can say what you can eat.
[00:16:18.769 --> 00:16:19.569]  What you can drink.
[00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:26.172]  Then now they've got to monitor you because you're part of the collective and why your behavior is costing other people money.
[00:16:26.772 --> 00:16:28.613]  That's one of the big pitfalls of collectivism.
[00:16:29.093 --> 00:16:31.414]  And then it always pushes this surveillance grid.
[00:16:31.935 --> 00:16:34.936]  And then they can bring in the one-child policies.
[00:16:35.256 --> 00:16:40.798]  Then they can bring in the death panels, the case for killing Granny.
[00:16:41.138 --> 00:16:43.459]  Out of one side of their mouth they say there's none of that going on.
[00:16:43.739 --> 00:16:44.520]  Out of the other side,
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:53.303]  Aside to Newsweek, Time Magazine, New Yorker Magazine, Bill Gates, Ted Turner, yeah, kill granny, hire ten teachers.
[00:16:53.644 --> 00:16:59.206]  They're selling you the collectivist model that if somebody dies, you get ahead.
[00:16:59.606 --> 00:17:01.647]  So it's a cannibalistic worldview.
[00:17:01.667 --> 00:17:08.630]  I mean, I hear liberals, mainline liberals all the time on talk radio saying, the pie is this big and doesn't get any bigger.
[00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:13.191]  And so, if you're going to get ahead, somebody else has got to lose.
[00:17:13.651 --> 00:17:19.653]  And why, if there are these ultra-rich people with this much of the pie, why, that means it's taking away from your pie.
[00:17:20.213 --> 00:17:31.056]  As long as wealthy people have free market systems and actually hire people and actually produce products or ideas or services, it actually grows the economy.
[00:17:31.296 --> 00:17:33.377]  That's basic economics, and the globalists know that.
[00:17:34.619 --> 00:17:51.351]  But it is the super robber baron elite who have always waged war against the middle class, against the merchant class, against the shopkeeper class, against the cobbler class, people who made shoes and clothes in their own little shops.
[00:17:52.335 --> 00:18:00.037]  Because they can become independently successful and independent of the system, and now they don't need a letter of mark.
[00:18:00.837 --> 00:18:08.899]  And if you look at, say, Bass Beer, it says the oldest, you know, official copyright in England.
[00:18:08.919 --> 00:18:20.882]  And you actually look at that mark for Bass Ale, and it's a letter from the Queen, an authorization in 16-something, I don't have one of the beers in front of me, to be able to brew beer.
[00:18:22.112 --> 00:18:25.234]  You had to get a license from the Queen.
[00:18:25.855 --> 00:18:27.796]  Now, how powerful does that make the Queen?
[00:18:28.096 --> 00:18:31.219]  That to be able to brew beer, you've got to have her authorization.
[00:18:31.819 --> 00:18:38.864]  To be able to take your ship out of the bay into the English Channel to engage in trade, you've got to have a license.
[00:18:39.444 --> 00:18:41.846]  To be able to fix your house, you've got to have a license.
[00:18:42.126 --> 00:18:48.531]  To be able to grow crops, you get a license specifically for what you can grow under feudalism.
[00:18:50.078 --> 00:18:52.039]  Oh, you're in with the king.
[00:18:52.159 --> 00:18:53.921]  You're in with the king of federal government.
[00:18:54.201 --> 00:19:00.124]  You're in with the titular head, the figurehead of the banking imperium, Barack Obama.
[00:19:00.625 --> 00:19:05.748]  Oh, you're McDonald's, or you're the big lobbying groups.
[00:19:06.849 --> 00:19:10.431]  You're the big unions.
[00:19:11.191 --> 00:19:13.673]  Oh, you get waivers from the health care.
[00:19:13.973 --> 00:19:18.336]  You don't have to pay for health care for your employees, but everybody else does.
[00:19:19.443 --> 00:19:22.166]  Again, everything that is old is new again.
[00:19:22.286 --> 00:19:23.668]  Everything that is new is old.
[00:19:24.188 --> 00:19:31.456]  Everything we're seeing has been done over and over and over and over again, and we know what it is.
[00:19:32.017 --> 00:19:35.080]  It starts with a T. A big T. A capital T.
[00:19:37.503 --> 00:19:40.746]  No, it's not Tyrannosaurus Rex, the tyrant lizard.
[00:19:41.266 --> 00:19:43.528]  Terrible lizard, but it's something very similar.
[00:19:43.889 --> 00:19:45.270]  It's called tyranny.
[00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:51.115]  And it's called mob rule by a mafia criminal syndicate.
[00:19:51.915 --> 00:19:56.659]  And if you want to be able to wipe your nose or get married, you've got to get a license to do it.
[00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:58.161]  This is not Land of the Free.
[00:19:59.716 --> 00:20:01.578]  Not all protein supplements are created equal.
[00:20:01.978 --> 00:20:10.585]  One World Whey is the first cold-temperature-processed, 100% all-natural, unrefined, bioactive, grass-pasture-raised milk-whey protein.
[00:20:10.985 --> 00:20:23.696]  Far from being another ordinary protein supplement, One World Whey is a full-spectrum nutrition power food in and of itself, providing overall life-building benefits that touch virtually every human's life, that other protein supplements don't deliver on.
[00:20:24.136 --> 00:20:24.956]  What are the benefits?
[00:20:25.317 --> 00:20:37.802]  Boosts the immune system, anti-aging properties, helps detoxification, helps reduce body fat, excellent for building lean muscle, increases energy levels, enhances the feelings of youth, sports performance, exercise recovery.
[00:20:38.342 --> 00:20:38.882]  Who's it for?
[00:20:39.262 --> 00:20:48.306]  Busy people, hard-working executives, students, teachers, active seniors, people recovering from illness, office workers, construction workers, and high-performance athletes.
[00:20:48.786 --> 00:20:50.450]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit oneworldway.com.
[00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:51.532]  That's oneworld, W-H-E-Y dot com.
[00:20:58.712 --> 00:20:59.853]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:20:59.893 --> 00:21:06.597]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:21:06.857 --> 00:21:09.159]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:21:09.439 --> 00:21:14.662]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:21:14.843 --> 00:21:17.644]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:21:17.785 --> 00:21:19.866]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:21:20.106 --> 00:21:26.070]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:29.612]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:21:29.772 --> 00:21:35.336]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:21:35.596 --> 00:21:36.917]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:21:37.237 --> 00:21:38.458]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:21:38.558 --> 00:21:41.100]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:42.661]  He explains everything you need to know.
[00:21:42.921 --> 00:21:45.305]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:21:45.465 --> 00:21:49.891]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:21:50.031 --> 00:21:52.475]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[00:21:52.635 --> 00:21:56.340]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.362]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:21:58.283 --> 00:22:00.105]  I'm Roger Rao at Midas Resources.
[00:22:00.365 --> 00:22:07.310]  If you are going through a financial roller coaster because of your investment in stocks, bonds, and other paper assets, perhaps you're ready for a change.
[00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:10.473]  You have an opportunity to change your financial security.
[00:22:10.653 --> 00:22:14.516]  Get the stability and peace of mind you deserve by investing in precious metals.
[00:22:14.736 --> 00:22:19.357]  Gold and silver have been a form of wealth protection for over 5,000 years all over the world.
[00:22:19.477 --> 00:22:25.639]  If you have seen your hard-earned money lose value because of inflation, sliding dollar, etc., it's time you stop the bleeding.
[00:22:25.719 --> 00:22:27.319]  The answer to your problems is simple.
[00:22:27.419 --> 00:22:30.980]  Gold and silver will protect your assets and your purchasing power.
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:34.361]  Physical possession of precious metals, IRA rollover, etc.
[00:22:34.661 --> 00:22:36.141]  Call me, Roger Rao, at 1-800-686-2010.
[00:22:38.382 --> 00:22:42.344]  Your natural organic herbal formula for heart health is Heart and Body Extract.
[00:22:42.565 --> 00:22:45.526]  My name is Span and I'm 68 years old and I live in Vermont.
[00:23:06.144 --> 00:23:10.628]  In the spring of 2003, I started to have problems with my heart.
[00:23:10.888 --> 00:23:12.830]  It felt like my heart was pounding.
[00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:14.291]  Made me feel breathless.
[00:23:14.692 --> 00:23:18.735]  I tried many, many different things to try to get some help for myself.
[00:23:19.135 --> 00:23:20.136]  Nothing did anything.
[00:23:20.216 --> 00:23:24.180]  Heart and Body Extract is very powerful, very effective, and works quickly.
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:27.643]  I saw one of Sharon's ads and ordered Heart and Body Extract.
[00:23:28.323 --> 00:23:30.946]  I noticed a difference quickly, within days.
[00:23:31.386 --> 00:23:36.010]  The episodes became less frequent and by a month had completely vanished.
[00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:38.992]  Usually you find a 30-day or 60-day guarantee.
[00:23:39.232 --> 00:23:43.836]  Heart and Body Extract comes with a lifetime 100% ironclad money-back guarantee.
[00:23:44.016 --> 00:23:45.718]  Details at hbextract.com or call 866-295-5305.
[00:23:45.738 --> 00:23:45.898]  Call 866-295-5305.
[00:23:45.918 --> 00:23:47.339]  866-295-5305 for Heart and Body Extract.
[00:24:02.554 --> 00:24:05.856]  The dependency game, the feudalism game, is very simple.
[00:24:06.957 --> 00:24:17.743]  Special interests go in, buy off the government, and then have the government mandate that the people basically pay taxes directly to those private interests.
[00:24:18.584 --> 00:24:27.149]  All over the U.S., foreign interests come in, buy off the politicians, have toll roads put on existing roads, and levy taxes directly on the citizenry.
[00:24:28.291 --> 00:24:29.752]  And that's what the Health Care Act is.
[00:24:30.393 --> 00:24:33.355]  But the Republicans would not attack it from truth.
[00:24:33.916 --> 00:24:36.979]  They attacked it and claimed it was communism, which is bad enough.
[00:24:37.139 --> 00:24:47.187]  No, it was fascism, written by the insurance companies, owned by the big banks, forcing 30 to 34 million, depending on what numbers you look at, to go out and buy this.
[00:24:47.748 --> 00:24:50.851]  But then insiders, they don't have to purchase it.
[00:24:51.832 --> 00:24:54.659]  Again, an unfair trade advantage, the essence of tyranny.
[00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:59.110]  How are we a free society if the government can order us to get health insurance?
[00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:05.314]  Can the government, as the federal judge pointed out, make us buy a home to end homelessness?
[00:25:05.974 --> 00:25:17.802]  We're going to play part of the clip from the debate in 2008 with Barack Obama, Barry Sotero, and Hillary Rodham Clinton, where he basically brought up that very point.
[00:25:17.862 --> 00:25:26.308]  And that's what the judge, Roger Vinson, put in his 70-plus page, 78-page ruling yesterday.
[00:25:26.328 --> 00:25:28.090]  And it's very fundamental.
[00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:33.957]  You know, this supposed free society was only free to a certain extent for a little over a hundred years.
[00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:37.341]  And since then, they've been steadily eroding it.
[00:25:37.581 --> 00:25:40.503]  We didn't have property taxes until the last 60 years or so.
[00:25:41.123 --> 00:25:44.805]  And now, all over the country, they're raising property taxes where people can't even own homes.
[00:25:45.365 --> 00:25:46.746]  I mean, it's becoming insane.
[00:25:47.126 --> 00:25:51.408]  A small home of $100,000, even in rural areas.
[00:25:51.448 --> 00:25:52.149]  I've seen the numbers.
[00:25:52.189 --> 00:25:52.709]  You've seen them.
[00:25:52.729 --> 00:25:53.229]  You've lived it.
[00:25:53.249 --> 00:25:57.151]  You know, they may put a $5,000, $10,000 fee on that.
[00:25:57.271 --> 00:25:58.912]  You're paying rent on your home.
[00:25:59.292 --> 00:26:02.274]  These are things that unfree nations have always had.
[00:26:04.158 --> 00:26:09.259]  And we have to recognize that what made this country so wealthy is being dismantled.
[00:26:09.579 --> 00:26:13.660]  But let's go ahead and play the clip of Obama in the debate with Hillary.
[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:28.443]  And then a year later, he starts trying to ram through the health care law, which they successfully got through last year, which does have the fines if you don't get health care, which does force you to get the health care, which does everything he said was so bad.
[00:26:28.503 --> 00:26:33.344]  And the judge has rightly put this in his ruling, pointing out the blatant
[00:26:33.664 --> 00:26:34.866]  Hypocrisy, here it is.
[00:26:37.571 --> 00:26:41.899]  Again, what did candidate Obama say about mandated insurance during the Democratic debates?
[00:26:42.717 --> 00:26:43.878]  And here is that clip.
[00:27:04.807 --> 00:27:06.108]  But now, what does he say about the health care law?
[00:27:25.655 --> 00:27:33.866]  Now, the health care law that they passed does have the fines and fees and does persecute people who don't get it.
[00:27:34.467 --> 00:27:36.169]  Now, remember Hillary at the time.
[00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:39.654]  Even though we had the legislation that she proposed back in the mid-90s,
[00:27:40.695 --> 00:27:53.703]  Even though we had the legislation that the Democrats were already promoting that said $5,000 fees, garnishing of wages, she said that it wasn't true, hoping that you wouldn't go read the bill.
[00:27:53.823 --> 00:27:56.485]  Well, what is now law in this country?
[00:27:56.545 --> 00:28:00.708]  What are they now preparing to try to implement in the next two years?
[00:28:00.748 --> 00:28:01.829]  It takes time to phase it in.
[00:28:02.739 --> 00:28:03.960]  as it's fought through the courts.
[00:28:04.601 --> 00:28:09.746]  They're trying to put exactly what they said they weren't going to do into place.
[00:28:09.866 --> 00:28:14.310]  And Obama, in the same debate, went on again to say, and was a good line,
[00:28:15.674 --> 00:28:16.335]  It was a zinger.
[00:28:16.915 --> 00:28:18.516]  But now it's being used back against him.
[00:28:18.917 --> 00:28:24.501]  He said, look, if I mandated as president everyone buy a house, would that end homelessness?
[00:28:24.861 --> 00:28:29.005]  How do you make someone buy a house who doesn't have the money to buy a house?
[00:28:29.525 --> 00:28:38.272]  Most Americans don't have the money to buy a house unless they go to some rural place where you can maybe buy a house for $30,000, $40,000 that's got the roof falling in on it.
[00:28:40.453 --> 00:28:41.454]  How do they do this?
[00:28:42.494 --> 00:28:44.535]  How do they try to force this?
[00:28:45.456 --> 00:28:56.421]  And it's completely unconstitutional on its face, because if they can make you buy health care, then the federal government can do anything.
[00:28:57.381 --> 00:29:07.046]  And speaking of doing anything, it isn't up on PrisonPlanet.com yet, but Watson called me this morning and it's going to be up on PrisonPlanet.com very, very soon, and you better believe we're going to cover it here.
[00:29:08.393 --> 00:29:12.475]  I know it's old news for this audience, but it's new news that they're actually rolling it out.
[00:29:13.335 --> 00:29:37.327]  The TSA via the VIPER teams is establishing warrantless checkpoints on major highways all over the United States and rolling out nationwide a full federal power grab of the infrastructure of the country, a power grab of the right to travel, the right of passage, the right to engage in commerce, a brazen violation of the Tenth Amendment, states' rights, and the Fourth Amendment.
[00:29:38.308 --> 00:29:46.636]  And we've got video reports of police in ski masks running random checkpoints all over the country, pulling people out of their cars.
[00:29:46.976 --> 00:29:47.697]  This is tyranny.
[00:29:49.219 --> 00:29:50.140]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:52.222]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.143 --> 00:29:55.846]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:58.956 --> 00:30:01.219]  Folks, you've heard us talk about Home Gain before.
[00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:11.231]  Home Gain is now offering a special promo where you get up to $150 when you buy or sell a home with a Home Gain agent you find through their Find a REALTOR® program.

[00:30:58.234 --> 00:31:02.477]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:31:02.797 --> 00:31:03.398]  Number one.
[00:31:03.698 --> 00:31:06.860]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:31:07.141 --> 00:31:07.701]  Number two.
[00:31:08.001 --> 00:31:12.545]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:31:12.885 --> 00:31:13.325]  It's true.
[00:31:13.625 --> 00:31:18.189]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:31:18.509 --> 00:31:19.049]  Number three.
[00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:22.612]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:31:22.912 --> 00:31:26.615]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:31:26.815 --> 00:31:27.375]  Number four.
[00:31:27.615 --> 00:31:29.976]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:31:30.356 --> 00:31:33.737]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:31:34.037 --> 00:31:34.577]  Number five.
[00:31:34.837 --> 00:31:38.758]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:31:38.978 --> 00:31:43.740]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:48.061]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:48.201 --> 00:31:49.762]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[00:31:59.307 --> 00:32:02.950]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:32:03.351 --> 00:32:06.353]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:32:06.594 --> 00:32:11.358]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:32:11.378 --> 00:32:17.623]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:32:17.784 --> 00:32:20.026]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:32:20.546 --> 00:32:20.826]  Tim Geithner?
[00:32:20.846 --> 00:32:21.266]  Bernanke?
[00:32:21.367 --> 00:32:21.967]  They're arsonists!
[00:32:22.027 --> 00:32:23.288]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:32:23.308 --> 00:32:25.549]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:32:39.457 --> 00:32:41.278]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:32:41.298 --> 00:32:46.339]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:32:46.719 --> 00:32:55.822]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:33:07.088 --> 00:33:09.992]  Well, I won't back down.
[00:33:11.294 --> 00:33:14.118]  No, I won't back down.
[00:33:14.398 --> 00:33:21.407]  We're gonna be getting into the record cold temperatures and record in at least the last four decades.
[00:33:22.148 --> 00:33:28.572]  The media is reporting snowfall over much of the United States and that huge blanket of snow burying the East Coast.
[00:33:28.653 --> 00:33:31.995]  It's been buried now at least three times in the last two months.
[00:33:32.976 --> 00:33:38.920]  And incredibly, the media is spinning this that it's carbon dioxide that's causing it and that it's humans.
[00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:41.561]  This is global warming, supposedly.
[00:33:41.982 --> 00:33:42.862]  That is coming up.
[00:33:43.122 --> 00:33:45.344]  Also, we're going to be getting into this later in the hour.
[00:33:45.704 --> 00:33:50.788]  TSA invades roads and highways with Viper checkpoints.
[00:33:51.348 --> 00:33:55.991]  TSA invades roads and highways with Viper checkpoints.
[00:33:56.791 --> 00:33:59.512]  Absolute, complete, classical tyranny.
[00:33:59.933 --> 00:34:04.975]  The seizure of infrastructure, but they will not control our southern and northern borders.
[00:34:05.536 --> 00:34:15.601]  They have never completed even small parts of the border fence, and of course they cancelled and never really began constructing, it was all show, the virtual fence.
[00:34:15.981 --> 00:34:20.284]  Meanwhile, Henry Kissinger, this video from Bloomberg, is up at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:34:21.064 --> 00:34:23.264]  Kissinger on Egypt unrest.
[00:34:23.605 --> 00:34:29.026]  This is only the first scene of the first act of a drama that is to be played out.
[00:34:29.046 --> 00:34:32.966]  So we're going to be getting into that as well.
[00:34:33.966 --> 00:34:38.827]  But getting first in to Chuckie Schumer.
[00:34:39.407 --> 00:34:40.648]  Now this is a U.S.
[00:34:40.668 --> 00:34:44.028]  Senator, before that a member of the House of Representatives.
[00:34:44.849 --> 00:34:46.689]  This is a guy who is very smart.
[00:34:47.691 --> 00:34:55.356]  And no doubt knows that the three branches of government, as any five-year-old should know, are Executive, Legislative, and Judicial.
[00:34:55.797 --> 00:35:03.382]  The Executive is the President, the Legislative is the House and Senate, and, of course, the Judicial is the courts.
[00:35:04.264 --> 00:35:09.771]  But he says that they've got to get the three branches of government together, when he was on CNN a few days ago.
[00:35:10.572 --> 00:35:13.216]  They've got to get the three branches of government together.
[00:35:13.276 --> 00:35:14.418]  And what are those three branches?
[00:35:14.858 --> 00:35:16.320]  The House, the Senate, and the President.
[00:35:16.841 --> 00:35:18.122]  Well, that's only two branches.
[00:35:18.503 --> 00:35:20.746]  He counts the Legislative as two.
[00:35:21.987 --> 00:35:22.948]  So, incredible.
[00:35:23.769 --> 00:35:24.730]  And he knows what he's doing.
[00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:30.596]  They just engage in this type of baloney, just like parrots for decades.
[00:35:30.616 --> 00:35:31.938]  They say, we're a democracy.
[00:35:32.658 --> 00:35:41.587]  In a democracy, if 51% of the American people vote to take the other 49% of the people's property and put you in slave camps, it happens.
[00:35:42.248 --> 00:35:45.733]  In a democracy, if 51% vote to take your guns, it happens.
[00:35:46.174 --> 00:35:50.040]  In a democracy, if 51% vote to merge with China, it happens.
[00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:57.150]  In a democracy, if 51% vote to put carbon taxes on everyone, it happens.
[00:35:57.831 --> 00:36:17.304]  In a republic, a constitutional republic, that our country has been the model of worldwide in the last 235 years, the model of liberty, you have basic liberties to private property, the Second Amendment, the right to travel, the federal government isn't allowed to take over society, it only has three powers, and those are limited.
[00:36:18.004 --> 00:36:18.885]  Ninth and Tenth Amendment.
[00:36:19.585 --> 00:36:27.973]  And so it's so fundamental when they tell you that we're a democracy, as Benjamin Franklin said, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:36:28.314 --> 00:36:32.998]  If there were two wolves and a sheep and they sat down and said, what's going to be for dinner?
[00:36:33.619 --> 00:36:36.782]  The two wolves would outvote the sheep and they would eat the sheep.
[00:36:37.443 --> 00:36:40.005]  But in a republic, the sheep is protected.
[00:36:40.886 --> 00:36:51.988]  But now in this quasi-fake mob rule, the system hypes up the dumbed-down masses and gets them to feel entitled and to go along with an agenda of free health care.
[00:36:52.008 --> 00:36:53.348]  Remember all the Obama supporters?
[00:36:53.488 --> 00:36:54.768]  Oh, thank you, Mr. President.
[00:36:55.008 --> 00:36:58.329]  Right after he got elected, I won't have to buy health care anymore.
[00:36:58.349 --> 00:36:59.629]  I won't have to have a house payment.
[00:36:59.909 --> 00:37:01.089]  I won't have to have a car payment.
[00:37:01.169 --> 00:37:02.070]  Oh, thank you, Mr. President.
[00:37:02.130 --> 00:37:04.750]  Remember all of them falling down, fainting everywhere?
[00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:07.871]  Well, we're two years into this nightmare.
[00:37:07.891 --> 00:37:09.771]  Did you get all the free goodies you were looking for?
[00:37:12.621 --> 00:37:16.819]  Again, the Founding Fathers warned of the dangers of the howling mob.
[00:37:18.285 --> 00:37:26.408]  Once Rome fell from being a republic to being run by Caesar, he began to give welfare to the mob.
[00:37:26.648 --> 00:37:29.449]  He began to employ the street gangs.
[00:37:29.489 --> 00:37:35.510]  He began to hire, through successive kings, Caesars, rulers, Kaisers.
[00:37:36.271 --> 00:37:37.971]  And you know what Rome turned into?
[00:37:38.411 --> 00:37:40.732]  We know where this goes.
[00:37:41.372 --> 00:37:41.792]  We know.
[00:37:42.012 --> 00:37:42.773]  You go to Egypt.
[00:37:42.833 --> 00:37:46.274]  If you don't have the government's stamp, you don't get to have a business.
[00:37:47.133 --> 00:37:49.114]  This isn't what a free society looks like.
[00:37:49.154 --> 00:37:51.235]  And I know I keep repeating that, but it's amazing.
[00:37:51.475 --> 00:37:57.178]  Here is Chuckie Schumer telling everybody the three branches of government are the House, the Senate, and the President.
[00:37:57.478 --> 00:38:00.380]  And there's no way he didn't know what he was doing.
[00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:00.880]  Here it is.
[00:38:03.208 --> 00:38:10.915]  ...to get social security checks, he can't fund the military, but ultimately it risks the credit markets.
[00:38:11.096 --> 00:38:15.480]  They are getting wary because of the large debt we have, which we have to get down.
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:18.843]  But if they feel that people are willing to shut down the government,
[00:38:20.244 --> 00:38:33.458]  You could risk the credit markets really losing some confidence in the United States Treasury and that could create a deeper recession than we had over the last several years.
[00:38:33.998 --> 00:38:35.540]  God forbid even a depression.
[00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:38.323]  So I would urge my Republican colleagues
[00:38:38.783 --> 00:38:40.664]  Uh, no matter how strongly they feel.
[00:38:41.064 --> 00:38:42.965]  You know, we have three branches of government.
[00:38:43.025 --> 00:38:45.327]  We have a House, we have a Senate, we have a President.
[00:38:45.367 --> 00:38:47.968]  And all three of us are gonna have to come together and give some.
[00:38:48.409 --> 00:38:56.133]  But it is playing with fire to risk the shutting down of the government, just as it is playing with fire to risk not paying the debt.
[00:38:56.293 --> 00:38:56.573]  Okay.
[00:38:57.254 --> 00:38:59.355]  Yeah, playing with fire.
[00:38:59.375 --> 00:39:02.477]  Uh, this is all part of their disinformation campaign.
[00:39:03.413 --> 00:39:08.398]  Now, this next clip is also from CNN.
[00:39:09.359 --> 00:39:13.524]  And first, let me get into this news that's a prelude to what we're about to play.
[00:39:14.325 --> 00:39:16.787]  This is out of AFP.
[00:39:17.508 --> 00:39:21.532]  Senators vow to strip Obama climate power.
[00:39:22.483 --> 00:39:30.288]  Well, they have to, because he's illegitimately, through the Environmental Protection Agency, implementing the Kyoto U.N.
[00:39:30.348 --> 00:39:46.177]  Treaty Protocol, which is selective only on Western Europe, Canada, England, Australia, New Zealand, and the U.S., to slap giant 20% taxes to begin with in Phase 1 on all of our power plants.
[00:39:46.557 --> 00:39:49.859]  Coal fired, natural gas, you name it.
[00:39:51.195 --> 00:39:53.137]  And more than half our power is generated by coal.
[00:39:54.158 --> 00:39:55.999]  Now, China's building two to three a week.
[00:39:56.039 --> 00:39:59.362]  We're only allowed to build two a year under federal permitting.
[00:39:59.943 --> 00:40:01.304]  Now, what has Obama done?
[00:40:01.344 --> 00:40:11.213]  He's come into Texas a month ago and seized the power plants in a regulatory order demanding that they either reduce output or pay higher taxes.
[00:40:11.673 --> 00:40:12.694]  No law behind that.
[00:40:13.375 --> 00:40:15.197]  The president is just doing it.
[00:40:16.037 --> 00:40:16.478]  Just like
[00:40:17.824 --> 00:40:20.925]  They're doing so many other things that are unconstitutional.
[00:40:21.426 --> 00:40:29.389]  And conservative senators vowed to strip President Obama of his power to regulate greenhouse gases in a move that would cripple U.S.
[00:40:29.449 --> 00:40:31.630]  efforts on climate change if successful.
[00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:35.052]  Gotta love how the news just reports climate change.
[00:40:35.072 --> 00:40:36.092]  See, it was global warming.
[00:40:36.112 --> 00:40:36.953]  Now it's change.
[00:40:37.433 --> 00:40:39.614]  And they tell school kids, when it gets cold, it's global warming.
[00:40:40.319 --> 00:40:41.560]  When it gets hot, it's global warming.
[00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:43.561]  Now they've shifted into climate change.
[00:40:43.861 --> 00:40:45.282]  We always have climate change.
[00:40:45.923 --> 00:40:48.925]  They've had several mini ice ages in the last 10,000 years.
[00:40:49.325 --> 00:40:51.006]  That's confirmed by the ice core samples.
[00:40:51.286 --> 00:41:02.013]  It's the sun that drives it, and moon cycles, because the moon controlling the ocean tides, and also blocking, or not blocking depending on where it is, solar winds.
[00:41:02.694 --> 00:41:10.279]  It's the winds of space, and the sun, and these energies that ionize the atmosphere that create the aurora borealis.
[00:41:13.681 --> 00:41:24.729]  But the UN, back in 2009, about a year and two months ago, announced at the summit in Copenhagen, they had a declaration.
[00:41:25.709 --> 00:41:42.224]  And said the sun has no effect on climate, because all these scientific bodies and scientists were bringing in petitions saying it's the sun, it's the sun, humans have almost no effect, it's the sun, it's the sun, carbon dioxide's a life-giving gas that then plants respirate from and give off oxygen.
[00:41:42.524 --> 00:41:51.352]  And so they had a confab, a conclave, and said we find that the sun has no effect on climate change.
[00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:59.694]  That'd be like the Pope 600 years ago saying, we find that the Earth is the center of the universe and the Sun orbits the Earth.
[00:42:00.014 --> 00:42:01.835]  We find the Earth is flat.
[00:42:02.395 --> 00:42:05.937]  We find the moon is made of Swiss cheese.
[00:42:07.142 --> 00:42:11.649]  They actually found that the earth was flat and that the earth was not the, uh, and the earth was the center of the universe.
[00:42:11.669 --> 00:42:14.453]  They didn't find it was made of Swiss cheese, but they might as well.
[00:42:15.134 --> 00:42:23.446]  We find at this conference of cardinals that the earth is flat and anyone who says otherwise will be burned at the stake!
[00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:31.893]  And the UN says, we find at this meeting that the sun has no effect on the climate of the Earth!
[00:42:32.093 --> 00:42:33.233]  We said so!
[00:42:33.714 --> 00:42:34.794]  It's humans' fault!
[00:42:35.094 --> 00:42:36.115]  Pay us taxes!
[00:42:36.375 --> 00:42:41.056]  Let us regulate and decide who can have businesses and factories or we'll shut you down!
[00:42:41.277 --> 00:42:44.478]  The oceans will rise and everyone will die immediately!
[00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:55.825]  Continuing here, blizzard, ice storm, nasty cold weather aimed at Midwest, the East.
[00:42:56.705 --> 00:43:05.112]  They're reporting in the news, storm could be one of the worst on record, dumping feet of snow.
[00:43:06.093 --> 00:43:13.719]  I was just reading that of all things, Midwestern airports are shut down, not just Eastern airports.
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:15.601]  All of this is going on.
[00:43:16.421 --> 00:43:18.103]  And what does National News report?
[00:43:18.925 --> 00:43:24.606]  They have different scientific grips on, with no proof, no facts, and they can't even say it with a straight face.
[00:43:25.226 --> 00:43:35.468]  If you can't see this video because you're listening on the radio, I've asked Curt Nemo and Paul Watson on InfoWars.com and PrisonBunda.com to post the video that we're about to play.
[00:43:36.508 --> 00:43:48.030]  But here's the reporter talking about the record cold weather and everything, and they cut to the so-called scientist who has to contain herself to not laugh, and looks like she's been caught with her hand in the cookie jar.
[00:43:48.706 --> 00:43:52.588]  I mean, it looks like when I come around the corner and my son's acting suspicious and I go, what's going on?
[00:43:52.608 --> 00:43:54.549]  I go, what do you got in your pockets?
[00:43:54.970 --> 00:43:58.152]  You got up in the cupboard and got extra cookies before dinner?
[00:43:58.172 --> 00:43:59.813]  And he's like, yeah.
[00:43:59.893 --> 00:44:08.057]  I mean, she looks just like my son when I catch him because he's the only one that can climb all the way up to the top of the pantry and get the cookies out.
[00:44:08.318 --> 00:44:10.259]  Or my wife keeps the sweets for treats.
[00:44:10.879 --> 00:44:23.663]  I mean, just absolutely guilty of sin, like Sylvester caught with Tweety Bird in his mouth with a feather sticking out, and they just tell us, oh, it's the carbon is driving unnatural weather.
[00:44:24.123 --> 00:44:24.463]  Yes.
[00:44:25.143 --> 00:44:26.424]  Folks, if you read the accounts...
[00:44:27.364 --> 00:44:34.589]  There have been times in the colonies and times since then when entire rivers that haven't been frozen since have been frozen.
[00:44:34.909 --> 00:44:44.395]  There were times where it was so cold in England, if you go back 350-400 years ago, they call it the Little Ice Age, where for years the Thames River
[00:44:45.356 --> 00:44:56.160]  That hasn't been frozen over since would be frozen as hard as a rock and no ships could come in around the clock, not just in the winter, but for an entire year or more.
[00:44:56.500 --> 00:44:57.120]  Frozen!
[00:44:58.041 --> 00:44:59.081]  Frozen solid!
[00:44:59.401 --> 00:45:01.602]  Because there are many cycles.
[00:45:02.964 --> 00:45:09.408]  And even scientists then, with their telescopes, found a correlation between cold weather and there not being sunspots.
[00:45:09.428 --> 00:45:10.329]  Because what are sunspots?
[00:45:10.809 --> 00:45:22.937]  When the sun heats up and puts off more radiation, you see sunspots because those are really giant explosions out into space, in some cases tens of thousands of times the size of the Earth.
[00:45:23.338 --> 00:45:32.564]  So you better believe when the sun's exploding and heating up and shooting off these giant coronal ejections, that that's going to affect our weather.
[00:45:33.304 --> 00:45:36.206]  But the UN has said it does not affect it.
[00:45:36.706 --> 00:45:37.086]  No!
[00:45:37.646 --> 00:45:48.312]  And if you pay a carbon indulgence to Al Gore, he will wave his magic pixie wand like Tinkerbell and will fix all of the problems.
[00:45:48.332 --> 00:45:53.134]  Because remember, under Kyoto, China, India, Mexico, the list goes on and on.
[00:45:53.194 --> 00:45:57.416]  Over 160 other countries have to make zero cuts.
[00:45:57.957 --> 00:45:58.397]  Zero!
[00:45:58.437 --> 00:45:59.778]  So where is the industry going to go?
[00:46:00.018 --> 00:46:02.019]  They're going to go there, where there's not all those taxes.
[00:46:02.739 --> 00:46:06.280]  And where do the globalists own and have the sweetheart deals?
[00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:07.801]  With the third world dictators?
[00:46:08.501 --> 00:46:09.461]  Those third world countries.
[00:46:09.501 --> 00:46:21.645]  So their businesses, the globalist factories, get to operate unfettered, and anyone else who doesn't have the inside track, just like with Obama, you don't pay him campaign money, you don't get the waiver on health care.
[00:46:21.865 --> 00:46:29.688]  He waves the magic Al Gore, you know, pixie wand, and everything's okay.
[00:46:29.728 --> 00:46:31.769]  This is classic brazen
[00:46:33.188 --> 00:46:33.668]  Tyranny.
[00:46:34.349 --> 00:46:39.612]  Where you've got to lick the boot of the government and pay them the indulgences and then you're allowed to operate.
[00:46:39.832 --> 00:46:51.200]  So let's go ahead and play this amazing clip from CNN where they're telling us this cold weather is a response to the global warming, the climate change, the carbon dioxide.
[00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:54.462]  All this carbon, that's what's causing it.
[00:46:54.502 --> 00:46:54.883]  Here it is.
[00:46:55.843 --> 00:46:57.625]  So, why are we getting so much snow?
[00:46:57.725 --> 00:46:59.307]  Well, joining me now from Washington, D.C.
[00:46:59.367 --> 00:47:03.411]  is climate scientist Brenda Esmeralda with the Union of Concerned Scientists.
[00:47:03.451 --> 00:47:04.412]  Brenda, good morning.
[00:47:04.773 --> 00:47:05.353]  Good morning.
[00:47:05.513 --> 00:47:07.015]  Do people kind of glare at you these days?
[00:47:08.557 --> 00:47:11.520]  You know, if we take a look at these snow totals so far, we've got a graphic here.
[00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:15.744]  So far this winter, New York City has gotten 56.1 inches.
[00:47:16.485 --> 00:47:17.266]  We usually get about 22.
[00:47:18.687 --> 00:47:19.728]  Look at Boston.
[00:47:19.928 --> 00:47:20.908]  It's gotten 60.3 inches.
[00:47:20.948 --> 00:47:22.609]  Their average is almost 42.
[00:47:22.749 --> 00:47:25.131]  Philly already seeing almost 38 inches.
[00:47:25.171 --> 00:47:26.832]  Their average is closer to 20.
[00:47:27.572 --> 00:47:28.593]  What is going on?
[00:47:29.893 --> 00:47:39.959]  Okay, what's really going on is that we are overloading the atmosphere with extra carbon, which is trapping extra heat because we burned lots of coal and oil.
[00:47:40.359 --> 00:47:44.321]  And so what this is doing is turbocharging weather patterns.
[00:47:44.802 --> 00:47:47.183]  So what we see is that in the spring and the summer,
[00:47:47.783 --> 00:47:52.168]  In places where it rains, we are recording much heavier rainfall.
[00:47:52.808 --> 00:47:57.353]  And in the wintertime, we are also recording much heavier snowstorms.
[00:47:57.433 --> 00:48:02.038]  In other words, climate change is creating a new normal of weather extremes.
[00:48:02.378 --> 00:48:07.023]  And we have to plan for this and prepare our snow removal budgets for such a change.
[00:48:08.354 --> 00:48:10.076]  Okay, so it goes on from there.
[00:48:10.516 --> 00:48:13.899]  And I got that confused because I saw a similar CNN clip where they're saying the same thing.
[00:48:13.919 --> 00:48:15.260]  That was MSNBC.
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:18.262]  And you look at her almost laughing the entire time.
[00:48:19.003 --> 00:48:27.850]  So the reporter comes in like, boy, you global warming alarmists from the concerned scientist group, is this discrediting you?
[00:48:27.890 --> 00:48:34.236]  And she's like, no, haha, the carbon is causing more extreme weather.
[00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:39.357]  And when they have tornadoes, they get on the local news and say climate change.
[00:48:39.637 --> 00:48:40.859]  We've always had tornadoes.
[00:48:41.962 --> 00:48:47.091]  There's always extreme climate going on in the thousands of microclimates around the world.
[00:48:48.089 --> 00:48:49.690]  There have been so many cases.
[00:48:49.970 --> 00:48:55.315]  It's on record of blizzard after blizzard after blizzard after blizzard after blizzard.
[00:48:55.595 --> 00:48:57.296]  So you've got to love this spin.
[00:48:58.077 --> 00:49:01.599]  They go from three years ago saying we're not going to have snow anymore.
[00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:03.000]  You saw the headlines.
[00:49:03.181 --> 00:49:04.181]  Snowless winters.
[00:49:04.642 --> 00:49:07.004]  We'll never see another white Christmas in the U.S.
[00:49:07.464 --> 00:49:08.465]  Global warming.
[00:49:08.945 --> 00:49:10.927]  Al Gore said seven years ago that within
[00:49:11.707 --> 00:49:19.674]  Seven years and now that time is up that we would see the sea levels rise and gobble up New York and San Diego and San Francisco.
[00:49:20.294 --> 00:49:25.439]  And now he said again last year, again within seven years it would happen again.
[00:49:25.459 --> 00:49:27.681]  And no one calls them on it.
[00:49:28.786 --> 00:49:40.533]  So now they've shifted, remember early last year we got an internal memo, the New York Times reported on it, from the White House saying, nobody's buying global warming anymore, we gotta call it climate change.
[00:49:40.993 --> 00:49:48.257]  And that's the new term, and so whatever it is, they can claim that if it gets hotter it's global warming, you know, if it gets hotter some summer.
[00:49:48.618 --> 00:49:52.220]  Or if it gets colder in the summer, or colder in the winter, or hotter in the winter.
[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:56.981]  No matter what the weather is, they are going to save you.
[00:49:57.341 --> 00:50:04.764]  And we've got to get ready with our budgets, you know, so that we can dig out of the new ice age caused by the global warming.
[00:50:05.344 --> 00:50:08.625]  And remember the day after tomorrow that came out about a decade ago?
[00:50:09.585 --> 00:50:16.391]  They kind of hedged their bets with that movie where the global warming causes a global freeze.
[00:50:17.032 --> 00:50:18.193]  So they're really hedging their bets.
[00:50:18.233 --> 00:50:24.638]  If you go back to the 70s, John P. Holdren and others in the UN said that we were going to have an ice age by 1990.
[00:50:25.078 --> 00:50:27.340]  It was going to be devastating because of carbon dioxide.
[00:50:27.801 --> 00:50:28.922]  And then that didn't happen.
[00:50:29.002 --> 00:50:30.643]  So by the late 80s, they said, no, no, no.
[00:50:31.004 --> 00:50:32.265]  Now it's global warming.
[00:50:33.488 --> 00:50:35.229]  And then they said, well, people are going to wake up to that.
[00:50:35.249 --> 00:50:39.812]  And they said, well, we'll just go ahead and hedge our bets and say no matter what happens, humans did it.
[00:50:41.353 --> 00:50:50.979]  OK, I want to get into the situation with the TSA invades roads and highways with Viper checkpoints.
[00:50:51.959 --> 00:50:57.723]  And that report by Paul Joseph Watson is up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.

[00:51:57.705 --> 00:52:00.186]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:52:00.226 --> 00:52:06.928]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:52:07.189 --> 00:52:09.489]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:52:09.749 --> 00:52:14.991]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:52:15.171 --> 00:52:17.972]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:52:18.112 --> 00:52:20.193]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:52:20.433 --> 00:52:26.397]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:52:26.718 --> 00:52:29.940]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:35.664]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:52:35.924 --> 00:52:37.265]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:52:37.585 --> 00:52:38.806]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:52:38.906 --> 00:52:41.448]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:52:41.568 --> 00:52:45.651]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:52:45.831 --> 00:52:47.873]  You can find the video at www.
[00:52:48.473 --> 00:52:51.958]  This is Alex Jones with 5 Good Reasons You Should Consider Buying a Solar Power Generator.
[00:53:04.093 --> 00:53:08.076]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:53:08.376 --> 00:53:12.919]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:53:13.259 --> 00:53:13.699]  It's true.
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:19.423]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:53:19.703 --> 00:53:22.985]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:53:23.286 --> 00:53:27.008]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:53:27.188 --> 00:53:27.748]  Number 4.
[00:53:27.989 --> 00:53:30.350]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:53:30.751 --> 00:53:34.133]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:53:34.433 --> 00:53:34.653]  Number 5.
[00:53:35.234 --> 00:53:39.136]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:53:39.377 --> 00:53:44.140]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:48.445]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:53:48.585 --> 00:53:50.147]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:53:50.367 --> 00:53:52.470]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:53:52.630 --> 00:53:54.973]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:54:15.712 --> 00:54:16.053]  Show!
[00:54:28.254 --> 00:54:33.458]  If this show acclimates you to the New World Order, then it's helping the globalists.
[00:54:33.498 --> 00:54:40.082]  But I believe, and I know, that people can consciously, from an unemotional view, realize what's happening and stand up against it.
[00:54:40.122 --> 00:54:52.110]  But if we talk about government plans to push implantable microchips on the elderly, on prisoners for years, and then the media starts actually pushing it, in a way it almost just conditions people to accept it.
[00:54:52.791 --> 00:54:56.013]  Even though we don't like it, it becomes a foregone conclusion.
[00:54:56.793 --> 00:54:58.454]  And it's the same thing with the TSA.
[00:54:58.854 --> 00:55:19.740]  I remember, as I've said 150 times probably, Governor Ridge on C-SPAN in 2002, before Homeland Security even got a cabinet position and congressional funding, saying you're going to have a federal ID card to work, we're going to have federal security guards on every street corner, we're going to have checkpoints, you're going to have an internal passport to travel.
[00:55:21.118 --> 00:55:22.559]  And I remember them talking about that.
[00:55:22.599 --> 00:55:35.667]  Now they admit, with the Real ID, a few years ago they tried to threaten the states and said, if you don't implement a federally issued and controlled ID card to the state level, we are going to not let you international parks or get on airplanes.
[00:55:36.187 --> 00:55:40.289]  So it's the seizure of commerce and travel, the right to be mobile.
[00:55:40.609 --> 00:55:46.073]  That's a bedrock, keystone, or cornerstone to any oppressive system.
[00:55:47.045 --> 00:55:48.306]  to any despotism.
[00:55:48.847 --> 00:55:50.368]  I mean, it's one of the things they've gotta have.
[00:55:51.088 --> 00:55:56.533]  And so now we see TSA, PSA saying, the TSA can't always be there, but we will try.
[00:55:56.973 --> 00:56:03.459]  Like at football games, and it shows TSA at a Buccaneers football game.
[00:56:03.939 --> 00:56:08.203]  And it shows them at hotels, and it shows the TSA at malls, searching people.
[00:56:09.084 --> 00:56:11.546]  And they're at train stations and bus stations.
[00:56:12.046 --> 00:56:13.948]  And so they're phasing this in.
[00:56:15.245 --> 00:56:16.886]  And it's a violation of the Tenth Amendment.
[00:56:17.726 --> 00:56:19.846]  It's a violation of the state's rights.
[00:56:20.146 --> 00:56:21.707]  It's a violation of your Fourth Amendment.
[00:56:22.247 --> 00:56:32.450]  And Watson has another article of, you know, cops running around in ski masks warrantlessly in Alabama on a highway just pulling people off into a parking lot and searching them.
[00:56:34.291 --> 00:56:41.433]  I mean, that's... It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that that's the sign of a banana republic, third world despotic system.
[00:56:42.213 --> 00:57:06.292]  And now Watson has this article where the TSA is announcing, and again, media isn't reporting on this, we're getting this from TSA announcements, we're getting this from trucking companies getting their drivers ready for it, where they have mobile x-ray trucks, they're using the Army, we have a link to a Fox News report on that from last year, and they just, in the middle of the country, from Tennessee to New York,
[00:57:07.199 --> 00:57:22.072]  From Michigan to California, they'll have Marines, they'll have Army, they'll have Border Patrol there, and they just... Well, you remember a year and a half ago in Tennessee, this happened, and the governor said, you can't do that without my permission, and they just said, we're gonna do what we want.
[00:57:22.092 --> 00:57:26.115]  That's in my film, Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA.
[00:57:27.496 --> 00:57:32.501]  I mean, this is all going on, and it's not getting a lot of attention, and it's so incredible.
[00:57:33.649 --> 00:57:39.313]  I mean, when Hosni Mubarak rolled federal troops out all over Egypt, people went, whoa, that's martial law!
[00:57:39.613 --> 00:57:41.875]  They're setting up checkpoints in Egypt!
[00:57:42.195 --> 00:57:44.056]  They put an internet kill switch in Egypt!
[00:57:44.336 --> 00:57:46.278]  Oh my goodness gracious, this is tyranny!
[00:57:47.588 --> 00:57:53.255]  But oh, we're getting an internet kill switch and the feds are quietly rolling out and putting up telescreens saying, spy on your neighbors.
[00:57:53.635 --> 00:57:54.556]  It's no big deal.
[00:57:55.077 --> 00:57:56.999]  We've got to point out how this is wrong.
[00:57:57.259 --> 00:58:03.927]  We've got to get courts moving against it, like they're moving against government health care, like the states and courts are moving against the carbon taxes.
[00:58:04.027 --> 00:58:05.129]  It's all illegal.
[00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:08.541]  I mean, on its face, it's illegal!
[00:58:08.681 --> 00:58:11.662]  TSA invades roads and highways with Viper checkpoints.
[00:58:12.463 --> 00:58:24.448]  The TSA has announced its intention to expand the Viper program to include roadside inspections of commercial vehicles, setting up a framework and a network of internal checkpoints, and rolling out security procedures already active at airports, bus terminals, and subway stations.
[00:58:24.468 --> 00:58:27.910]  You know, warrantless bags checks to roads and highways across the U.S.
[00:58:28.310 --> 00:58:31.652]  And they go on to admit that they will then phase it into general traffic.
[00:58:32.232 --> 00:58:33.573]  What are you going to do with your family
[00:58:34.667 --> 00:58:36.349]  You say you won't fly to get away from him?
[00:58:36.649 --> 00:58:37.070]  Oh no!
[00:58:41.394 --> 00:58:43.297]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:44.818 --> 00:58:47.001]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.745 --> 00:58:54.366]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:58:54.706 --> 00:59:02.829]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:59:03.569 --> 00:59:07.590]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:59:08.190 --> 00:59:19.014]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:59:19.634 --> 00:59:28.637]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:59:29.157 --> 00:59:34.219]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.

[00:59:51.883 --> 00:59:53.804]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:54.264 --> 00:59:57.105]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:03.547 --> 01:00:04.187]  Big Brother.
[01:00:04.848 --> 01:00:05.908]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:06.608 --> 01:00:07.749]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:08.409 --> 01:00:09.189]  You want answers?
[01:00:09.949 --> 01:00:10.950]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:15.111]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:15.691 --> 01:00:19.773]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.008 --> 01:00:24.272]  Always informative and interesting and thought-provoking.
[01:00:24.292 --> 01:00:28.216]  David Ike joins us in the third hour, coming up in T-minus 60 minutes.
[01:00:28.677 --> 01:00:31.880]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny will join us for about 25 minutes, coming up in the next segment.
[01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:35.744]  The latest on the vaccine damage unfolding across the country.
[01:00:36.505 --> 01:00:45.011]  But if you just joined us, I'm going to also be getting more into the latest developments, obviously, in the Middle East and North Africa, as the globalists take credit for what's happening.
[01:00:45.031 --> 01:00:46.232]  I'm not even sure if that's true.
[01:00:46.292 --> 01:00:57.799]  They may just be trying to maneuver their people into the power vacuum as the people rebel against those Western installed and backed authoritarian oppressive states.
[01:00:58.380 --> 01:01:04.704]  But if you just joined us, I was getting into Paul Joseph Watson's article that's up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:01:07.426 --> 01:01:13.188]  And it deals with the TSA with their open press releases and their announcements.
[01:01:13.228 --> 01:01:14.609]  And by the way, this is already going on.
[01:01:15.749 --> 01:01:19.611]  TSA invades roads and highways with Viper checkpoints.
[01:01:20.728 --> 01:01:23.809]  They've announced the internal checkpoint program to be expanded.
[01:01:23.889 --> 01:01:34.973]  Up until now, commercial trucks and other vehicles only were subject to warrantless searches and radiation scans at specially designated state-owned inspection stations, traditionally set up at rest stops next to highways.
[01:01:35.433 --> 01:01:40.895]  These internal checkpoints, run by Homeland Security, you notice now they're putting up highway barriers even in rural areas.
[01:01:42.515 --> 01:01:50.838]  These internal checkpoints run by Homeland Security, the Department of Transportation, and the TSA involve trucks being scanned with backscatter x-ray devices in the name of safety.
[01:01:51.438 --> 01:01:55.960]  And the poor fools out there running them are getting radiated, and they also have the truck drivers drive under them.
[01:01:57.182 --> 01:02:10.827]  These inspection stations are now being expanded to normal roads and highways, unleashing an army of TSA agents who will be given a free hand to litter America with internal checkpoints and a chilling throwback to Soviet-style levels of control over the population.
[01:02:11.227 --> 01:02:12.787]  But the Mexican trucks will be exempt.
[01:02:13.228 --> 01:02:25.792]  Inspectors from the Transportation Security Administration, TSA, are likely to be more involved in roadside inspections of commercial vehicles, according to TSA officials, reports the industry website BulkTransporter.com.
[01:02:27.332 --> 01:02:37.900]  Quote, Viper teams can be extremely effective, you know, serving as a visible presence that is a random and unpredictable, says William Errington with the TSA.
[01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:45.626]  Viper teams are an essential part of protecting highway transportation vehicles and other critical infrastructure.
[01:02:46.006 --> 01:02:51.270]  See, that's how they hire your preachers to spy on you, your doctors, your lawyers, your neighbors.
[01:02:51.330 --> 01:02:56.054]  It's all under infrastructure protection, while the globalists de-industrialize the infrastructure.
[01:02:57.108 --> 01:03:00.811]  The report also notes that Viper Team members may or may not be in uniform.
[01:03:01.132 --> 01:03:03.894]  Oh, now we did a whole other headline.
[01:03:04.675 --> 01:03:10.740]  TSA to have secret police or plainclothes agents.
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:12.081]  I mean, this is the spy network.
[01:03:12.602 --> 01:03:16.305]  The report also notes that Viper Team members may or may not be in uniform.
[01:03:16.325 --> 01:03:22.791]  Stoking fears about the use of secret police, banning checkpoints, which will be more befitting of a Soviet Union or former East Germany.
[01:03:23.917 --> 01:03:32.521]  As we've documented, airport security style checkpoints and inspection procedures are already in place at bus terminals, train stations, and are rapidly expanding to the streets of America.
[01:03:33.322 --> 01:03:40.245]  And now they have the see something, say something program where they are running around.
[01:03:40.265 --> 01:03:44.487]  I mean, this is so hard for me to deal with.
[01:03:44.527 --> 01:03:46.488]  This is so hard for me to even
[01:03:47.677 --> 01:03:53.545]  Be able to comprehend that it's happening even though I've done the research on this information.
[01:03:54.026 --> 01:03:59.433]  Even though I constantly have studied how other oppressive systems are brought in.
[01:03:59.994 --> 01:04:02.718]  And the article goes on, this is such an important story.
[01:04:03.058 --> 01:04:06.363]  We have got to get this out to our legislatures, especially.
[01:04:06.704 --> 01:04:17.821]  I mean, this is a federal, illegal, globalist seizure of the entire infrastructure and a violation of the Tenth Amendment and the Fourth Amendment of citizens being put through this, and now they're going to be playing close.
[01:04:18.442 --> 01:04:23.144]  I want to beg you to get my film on DVD, Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA.
[01:04:23.625 --> 01:04:27.787]  Tyranny is here, the grim future foretold in 1984 has become a reality.
[01:04:28.127 --> 01:04:37.272]  I want to ask you to get it at InfoWars.com, to get the DVD, to give it to your sheriff, your police chief, your county commissioners, your legislatures, your members of the House and Senate.
[01:04:38.152 --> 01:04:44.457]  People need to see this two-hour film that breaks down the full spectrum of what the globalists are doing.
[01:04:44.477 --> 01:04:46.578]  This film is so important.
[01:04:46.878 --> 01:04:49.480]  You'll watch this, you'll understand the full spectrum takeover.
[01:04:49.741 --> 01:04:51.262]  It's available at InfoWars.com.
[01:04:51.302 --> 01:04:58.147]  You can also watch it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv and download and bury copies to give to others at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:04:59.008 --> 01:05:00.148]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:05:00.188 --> 01:05:06.870]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:05:07.130 --> 01:05:09.410]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:05:09.691 --> 01:05:14.872]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:05:15.052 --> 01:05:17.832]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:05:18.092 --> 01:05:20.153]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:05:20.413 --> 01:05:26.338]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:05:26.658 --> 01:05:29.861]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:05:30.041 --> 01:05:35.566]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:05:35.826 --> 01:05:37.147]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:05:37.468 --> 01:05:38.629]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:05:38.769 --> 01:05:41.291]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:05:41.431 --> 01:05:45.473]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:05:45.653 --> 01:05:50.136]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:05:50.276 --> 01:05:52.717]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[01:05:52.857 --> 01:05:56.559]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:05:56.739 --> 01:05:57.820]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:05:59.036 --> 01:06:02.339]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[01:06:02.619 --> 01:06:03.680]  It ended on June of 2009.
[01:06:03.741 --> 01:06:08.105]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[01:06:08.305 --> 01:06:13.950]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[01:06:14.250 --> 01:06:16.252]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[01:06:16.412 --> 01:06:19.075]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[01:06:19.435 --> 01:06:25.739]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[01:06:25.919 --> 01:06:27.740]  They both make fabulous investments.
[01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:33.203]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[01:06:33.484 --> 01:06:38.467]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[01:06:38.767 --> 01:06:43.930]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[01:06:44.110 --> 01:06:47.093]  This will freeze the cost your food while you can still afford it.
[01:06:47.313 --> 01:06:50.276]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[01:06:50.316 --> 01:06:51.077]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[01:06:58.373 --> 01:07:02.616]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:07:02.936 --> 01:07:03.537]  Number one.
[01:07:03.837 --> 01:07:06.999]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:07.840]  Number two.
[01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:12.684]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:07:13.024 --> 01:07:13.464]  It's true.
[01:07:13.764 --> 01:07:18.328]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:07:18.628 --> 01:07:19.188]  Number three.
[01:07:19.469 --> 01:07:22.751]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:07:23.051 --> 01:07:26.734]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:07:26.954 --> 01:07:27.494]  Number 4.
[01:07:27.735 --> 01:07:30.096]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:07:30.497 --> 01:07:33.879]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:34.400]  Number 5.
[01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:38.883]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:07:39.123 --> 01:07:43.887]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:07:44.167 --> 01:07:48.188]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:48.328 --> 01:07:49.889]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:50.129 --> 01:07:52.209]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:07:52.369 --> 01:07:54.990]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:07:55.210 --> 01:08:01.572]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:02.092 --> 01:08:04.893]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:15.189 --> 01:08:22.616]  Okay, at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to get into the latest developments dealing with the economy, what's happening in North Africa and the Middle East.
[01:08:22.896 --> 01:08:32.404]  The King of Jordan has had the government step down and put a new puppet government into place because of the demonstrations and protesting that's happening there.
[01:08:32.804 --> 01:08:40.371]  We'll get into another federal court ruling against Obamacare using Obama's own statements about how you can't make people buy houses so they won't be homeless.
[01:08:40.751 --> 01:08:43.392]  And you can't make people buy health insurance who can't afford it.
[01:08:44.112 --> 01:08:45.252]  So that is all coming up.
[01:08:45.372 --> 01:08:49.513]  And I want to open the phones up in the last half hour of this hour.
[01:08:49.573 --> 01:08:53.854]  The toll-free number to join us on any of the subjects we've been discussing here is 800-259-9231.
[01:08:53.874 --> 01:08:53.914]  800-259-9231.
[01:08:53.934 --> 01:08:54.594]  For the next 20 minutes...
[01:09:02.816 --> 01:09:22.429]  We've got a big announcement that just is launching today, I'm told, and that is a group of doctors and health practitioners, MDs, PhDs, NDs, coming together with a public document, just like the scientists and toxicologists have done that with the sodium fluoride, exposing how dangerous it is.
[01:09:23.189 --> 01:09:28.632]  And one of the leaders in this movement is Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, the health rangers involved as well, Mike Adams.
[01:09:29.393 --> 01:09:39.179]  She, of course, is a respected medical doctor and is one of the country's most knowledgeable and outspoken physicians regarding the use of vaccines on health.
[01:09:39.739 --> 01:09:47.282]  As a member of the prestigious National Speakers Association, Dr. Tenpenny is an outspoken advocate of free choice in healthcare, including the right to refuse vaccination.
[01:09:47.642 --> 01:09:50.803]  She's a graduate of University of Toledo, Toledo, Ohio.
[01:09:50.843 --> 01:09:56.745]  She received her medical training at Kirksville College in osteopathic medicine in Kirksville, Missouri.
[01:09:56.785 --> 01:10:01.967]  Dr. Tenpenny is board certified in emergency medicine and of course is also an author.
[01:10:02.047 --> 01:10:06.049]  DrTenpenny.com is the site, but I wanted to
[01:10:07.561 --> 01:10:07.961]  I don't
[01:10:36.448 --> 01:10:43.610]  I mean, we saw record low numbers of people in 2009, and now last year, taking the flu shot.
[01:10:44.330 --> 01:10:47.910]  We even saw the British Medical Journal come out and admit that that was basically all a hoax.
[01:10:48.631 --> 01:11:01.253]  Wolfgang Wudarg, the head of the EU Commission at the time, was on this show, saying that the whole H1N1 situation was a fraud, vindicating and confirming Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, Dr. Blaylock, and countless other doctors and scientists that have been talking about this.
[01:11:01.273 --> 01:11:04.794]  So I wanted to go over the fact that they are trying to push worldwide
[01:11:05.174 --> 01:11:06.455]  Four forced inoculation.
[01:11:06.915 --> 01:11:08.016]  And they're intimidating people.
[01:11:08.657 --> 01:11:10.278]  And there are places of work and other things.
[01:11:11.239 --> 01:11:12.960]  But the battle is joined.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.641]  People are really starting to wake up to this.
[01:11:15.162 --> 01:11:18.144]  And Dr. Sherry Tinpenny joins us with this big new announcement.
[01:11:18.184 --> 01:11:19.345]  Doc, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:11:19.872 --> 01:11:20.993]  Thank you for having me, Alex.
[01:11:21.033 --> 01:11:21.714]  Good afternoon.
[01:11:22.094 --> 01:11:22.735]  Good to have you here.
[01:11:22.755 --> 01:11:28.661]  Let's get into some of the latest developments dealing with vaccines and the hundreds they're trying to get approved and some of the adverse reactions.
[01:11:28.961 --> 01:11:35.107]  Then let's get into this big new announcement with the VaccineCouncil.org special report.
[01:11:36.690 --> 01:11:49.277]  The backdrop of what you said about how many vaccines are coming down the pike, there was a Business Wire news announcement that came out about two weeks ago out of Pennsylvania that said that there were 330 vaccines currently in development.
[01:11:49.617 --> 01:11:53.099]  There were 95 of them currently standing by waiting for approval.
[01:11:53.659 --> 01:12:08.593]  Now we know from the politics and from the government rules in this country that most of those vaccines are going to end up in the pediatric vaccination schedule in order for the companies to have liability protection to keep from getting sued.
[01:12:09.193 --> 01:12:26.785]  So we've got another, not only do we already have 40 doses of 16 different vaccines that kids get by the time that they're in kindergarten, we've got dozens more coming down the line, probably mostly being targeted at adolescents because that is the big push inside the vaccine industry is to get the teens vaccinated.
[01:12:28.425 --> 01:12:35.395]  And of course, for those that don't know, once they can have a governor or somebody mandate it, the media then runs the hoax and says, you must take it.
[01:12:35.415 --> 01:12:40.822]  But once it's mandated by government, then it gets liability protection like the Gardasil.
[01:12:41.162 --> 01:12:44.367]  If it kills you, well, that's too bad because they've got liability protection.
[01:12:47.665 --> 01:13:01.074]  Incredible, and I just, following the news, I see reports of deaths and convulsions and all sorts of autoimmune responses are just pouring out everywhere and even the Australian government is being honest about it and saying, yeah, these vaccines are killing people.
[01:13:01.829 --> 01:13:11.133]  Yes, as far as we know right now, that as of about the 1st of January 2011, that there are at least 87 confirmed deaths from the Gardasil vaccine.
[01:13:11.673 --> 01:13:14.054]  And so we have confirmed deaths.
[01:13:14.294 --> 01:13:16.715]  We are taking teenagers who were perfectly healthy.
[01:13:16.735 --> 01:13:18.696]  They were scholars and athletes and musicians.
[01:13:19.096 --> 01:13:19.176]  Yes.
[01:13:37.409 --> 01:13:46.451]  So what we've done with this document, Alex, is the International Medical Council on Vaccination, which is vaccinationcouncil.org, put together a group.
[01:13:46.691 --> 01:13:49.411]  Well, I started this document with Dr. Suzanne Humphreys.
[01:13:49.451 --> 01:14:01.533]  We started it about a year ago, and we wanted to make just some cliff notes, some very salient points that parents and activists could use to make the point that vaccines are not safe, they're not effective, they don't protect you, and yes, they're harmful.
[01:14:02.013 --> 01:14:05.374]  And then from there, what we said was, I wonder how many other doctors would agree with us.
[01:14:06.042 --> 01:14:29.202]  And when we released this document, there are 70 physicians, MDs, DOs, a few chiropractors, some RNs, some PhDs, but 70 people, people that you've never heard of, people that are not mainstream like you and I are, or Dr. Blaylock, and have said, come forward to say, yes, we agree in principle with this document that we want to stop vaccination, and we think it's a 200-year mistake.
[01:14:29.622 --> 01:14:45.075]  So one of our goals with releasing this and with the help of Mike Adams through Natural News and through your show and some other radio programs today is that we're wanting to collect a million signatures of people that in principle can get behind this.
[01:14:45.516 --> 01:14:56.145]  If you're an MD, a DO, a healthcare worker that practices in a conventional situation, even like a respiratory therapist or an x-ray tech, a nurse, a pharmacist,
[01:14:56.645 --> 01:15:09.175]  The third category is if you're a healthcare worker that doesn't practice in a conventional setting or if you are just a concerned citizen, a non-healthcare worker, that you believe in principles with these documents that vaccines can cause problems.
[01:15:09.455 --> 01:15:18.682]  We're asking you to get on board so we can have those signatures and go to the state legislators and get legislation passed to ensure your right to say no.
[01:15:19.656 --> 01:15:39.929]  So bottom line, a year of deep research, doctors and prestigious scientists all over the world signing onto this, tacking this letter to the door of the corrupt big pharma trying to take over medicine, the unbelievable carnage caused by them, and this is a huge offensive in defense
[01:15:41.009 --> 01:15:44.931]  of medical choice and against this medical tyranny.
[01:15:45.031 --> 01:15:46.071]  Very, very exciting.
[01:15:46.091 --> 01:15:48.712]  I'm glad you're announcing this and launching it here today.
[01:15:49.052 --> 01:15:51.133]  VaccineCouncil.org.
[01:15:51.593 --> 01:16:07.820]  And this is something you need to get into your health departments, into your public schools, into decision makers, so they understand that a large body of prestigious medical doctors and others are on record and really chronicling with the scientific data
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:09.181]  The other really cool thing
[01:16:31.144 --> 01:16:34.849]  And I know through the internet that this will go everywhere.
[01:16:35.290 --> 01:16:45.543]  Because this document is not only being released in English, it's being released in Greek, Spanish, Hebrew, French, Turkish, Dutch, Russian, and Icelandic even.
[01:16:45.683 --> 01:16:46.224]  And Turkish!
[01:16:46.664 --> 01:16:50.507]  We're waiting for documents to come back from Norway, Chinese and Japan.
[01:16:51.088 --> 01:17:04.619]  And so we've got physicians and practitioners all over the world that are signing on to this and saying we support the fact that vaccination is causing more harm than good and it must be stopped.
[01:17:07.082 --> 01:17:14.328]  Now let's codify the information folks will find at vaccinecouncil.org and what you're hoping people will do with this information.
[01:17:15.134 --> 01:17:17.916]  What I really want people to do is to go out and read the document.
[01:17:17.976 --> 01:17:28.864]  Quite frankly, Alex, there's most of the things that are in there, unless you're completely new to the vaccine industry and are just now sticking your toe in the water to find out what all of this nonsense is about.
[01:17:29.364 --> 01:17:32.906]  Most of this information are things that you can find readily elsewhere.
[01:17:33.006 --> 01:17:36.469]  We just pulled it all together and put it in one concise document.
[01:17:36.949 --> 01:18:00.812]  And I believe that what the government is doing, what they did with SARS, with bird flu, with swine flu, what they've actually done to Dr. Wakefield in their sense of punitive symbolism of what they have done to him, they are taking the American public and the Canadians and all these other people who maybe never even thought to question vaccines and are pulling their head up out of the sand and going, wow, maybe I ought to look into this.
[01:18:01.412 --> 01:18:08.419]  And the vast majority of people who do serious research and looking into the problems associated with vaccines say, wow, I'm not doing that anymore.
[01:18:08.479 --> 01:18:08.960]  I stop.
[01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:20.752]  So the harder they push, the more that they're finding that the grassroots revolution is starting against this whole set of ways that we're making our children the sickest children in the world.
[01:18:21.564 --> 01:18:23.125]  Well, we could talk for hours about this.
[01:18:23.165 --> 01:18:26.868]  We'll definitely have you back in the next month after this operation is launched.
[01:18:26.908 --> 01:18:34.733]  But going through these, it's a list of MDs, PhDs, Indies, and other medical professionals who are signing on to the document.
[01:18:35.153 --> 01:18:37.535]  Why vaccines have never been proven safe or effective.
[01:18:38.055 --> 01:18:41.657]  A list of some of the serious health side effects caused by vaccines.
[01:18:41.677 --> 01:18:43.699]  Of course, I know that's actually what they're meant to do.
[01:18:44.199 --> 01:18:46.180]  Why autism is associated with vaccines.
[01:18:46.541 --> 01:18:51.224]  The profit motivation behind the pharmacological industry's big vaccine push.
[01:18:51.824 --> 01:18:55.647]  A list of which institutions and organizations profit from your sickness.
[01:18:56.047 --> 01:19:03.373]  The shocking truth about what's in vaccines, aborted fetal tissue, 59 different chemicals, DNA from diseased animals and more.
[01:19:03.833 --> 01:19:06.556]  An overview of some of the most dangerous vaccine ingredients.
[01:19:06.916 --> 01:19:08.517]  The truth about conflicts of interest.
[01:19:08.557 --> 01:19:10.679]  That's the big one in the vaccine community.
[01:19:10.719 --> 01:19:11.559]  I would add the media.
[01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:14.342]  And why doctors profit from vaccination policies.
[01:19:14.702 --> 01:19:19.365]  Why vaccinated children are far worse health outcomes than unvaccinated children.
[01:19:20.126 --> 01:19:21.907]  How to opt out of mandatory vaccines.
[01:19:22.327 --> 01:19:26.928]  Important advice for parents about how to protect the health of your children while saying no to vaccines.
[01:19:27.369 --> 01:19:30.210]  Online resources for learning about the dangers of vaccines.
[01:19:30.590 --> 01:19:33.811]  A list of recommended reading material for further education.
[01:19:33.831 --> 01:19:37.052]  I mean, this is a masterstroke of codified information.
[01:19:37.252 --> 01:19:45.795]  When we come back in this next segment, Dr. Tenpenny, I want to just briefly have you go over some of the most important subsections that I just listed here.
[01:19:46.215 --> 01:19:47.577]  Listeners, you know the truth.
[01:19:47.597 --> 01:19:48.658]  You've done the research.
[01:19:48.918 --> 01:19:53.523]  This is all codified, put together, very easy to understand, very well documented.
[01:19:53.883 --> 01:19:54.144]  Get it.
[01:19:54.484 --> 01:19:55.545]  Get it out to everyone.
[01:19:55.565 --> 01:19:57.267]  This is a very important initiative.
[01:19:57.287 --> 01:19:57.848]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:00.017 --> 01:20:02.580]  New year, new way to smoke, and it's Totally Wicked!
[01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:07.886]  Introducing Totally Wicked e-liquid electronic cigarettes, the highest quality e-cigarettes in the world.

[01:20:16.997 --> 01:20:20.680]  Totally Wicked e-liquid cigarettes have a battery charge that lasts up to 8 hours.

[01:20:58.632 --> 01:21:00.935]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:21:00.955 --> 01:21:03.198]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:21:03.218 --> 01:21:06.122]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:21:06.542 --> 01:21:11.289]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:21:11.649 --> 01:21:15.855]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:21:16.155 --> 01:21:18.496]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:21:18.616 --> 01:21:21.037]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:21:21.377 --> 01:21:23.938]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:21:24.299 --> 01:21:31.902]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:21:32.239 --> 01:21:37.522]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:21:37.622 --> 01:21:40.423]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:21:40.483 --> 01:21:43.925]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:21:44.165 --> 01:21:45.086]  And I got news for you.
[01:21:45.246 --> 01:21:46.547]  You're everyone else.
[01:21:46.587 --> 01:21:47.567]  Invisible Empire.
[01:21:48.067 --> 01:21:55.871]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or watch it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:21:57.771 --> 01:22:00.273]  Again, the Congressional Budget Office sounds the alarm.
[01:22:00.534 --> 01:22:02.516]  This time warns of Greek-style U.S.
[01:22:02.576 --> 01:22:03.276]  debt crises.
[01:22:03.476 --> 01:22:04.257]  You heard me right.
[01:22:04.517 --> 01:22:06.940]  The GAO is drawing a parallel between the U.S.
[01:22:06.980 --> 01:22:10.363]  economy, its debt, and the current Greek economic meltdown.
[01:22:10.643 --> 01:22:17.510]  With the debt-to-GDP chart climbing into unfamiliar territory, the growing budget deficit will rise to unsupportable levels.
[01:22:18.010 --> 01:22:19.171]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:19.271 --> 01:22:26.273]  The Federal Debt and Risk of Financial Crises document the CBO has published is a must-read for every American.
[01:22:26.453 --> 01:22:33.876]  Covering the risk of continued deficit spending coupled with an aging population and the rising interest rates spell economic disaster.
[01:22:34.297 --> 01:22:38.038]  It's imperative that you get a copy of this document and study it for yourself.
[01:22:38.238 --> 01:22:40.379]  Call me today at 800-686-2237 and I'll send you a free copy.
[01:22:40.399 --> 01:22:40.979]  Again, call 800-686-2237
[01:22:47.702 --> 01:22:50.186]  And ask for your copy of the CBO document.
[01:22:50.427 --> 01:22:52.651]  Once again, you need to read this government report.
[01:22:52.851 --> 01:22:53.132]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:57.734 --> 01:23:01.017]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[01:23:01.838 --> 01:23:06.063]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[01:23:06.343 --> 01:23:12.269]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[01:23:12.489 --> 01:23:14.631]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[01:23:14.932 --> 01:23:20.898]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[01:23:21.018 --> 01:23:24.339]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[01:23:24.419 --> 01:23:26.120]  There is no other program of its kind.
[01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:28.341]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[01:23:28.461 --> 01:23:33.122]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.
[01:23:33.342 --> 01:23:33.962]  Guaranteed.
[01:23:34.163 --> 01:23:38.204]  Prevent wage garnishments, bank levies, and stop collection calls with our proven program.
[01:23:38.444 --> 01:23:43.246]  Call Zero Debt in 90 days now, 800-477-9256, and ask for free information from an expert who also completed our program.
[01:23:43.266 --> 01:23:44.406]  800-477-9256 or ZeroDebtGuarantee.com.
[01:23:44.426 --> 01:23:45.126]  800-477-9256 or ZeroDebtGuarantee.com.
[01:24:10.051 --> 01:24:13.095]  You can run on for a long time.
[01:24:13.115 --> 01:24:16.019]  Run on for a long time.
[01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:18.843]  Run on for a long time.
[01:24:19.544 --> 01:24:21.967]  Sooner or later gonna cut you down.
[01:24:22.548 --> 01:24:24.931]  Sooner or later gonna cut you down.
[01:24:24.991 --> 01:24:29.295]  Okay, Dr. Sherry Tenpenny is our guest.
[01:24:29.535 --> 01:24:35.201]  And if you look at all the statistics, the numbers, the globalist hoax of vaccines is caving in.
[01:24:35.481 --> 01:24:39.284]  But they're rushing forward, trying to force us back under their control.
[01:24:39.585 --> 01:24:49.354]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, of those points I ran over with this big launch today that you have put out, thevaccinationcouncil.org, very exciting information.
[01:24:49.834 --> 01:24:57.759]  Of those points that this sheet documents and links to larger reports on that everybody should read, what is most important?
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:04.404]  I think that the most important thing is, Alex, is the fact that number one, you cannot unvaccinate.
[01:25:05.379 --> 01:25:10.101]  So, you may, illnesses come and go, like the flu, pertussis, whatever.
[01:25:10.341 --> 01:25:11.322]  Illnesses come and go.
[01:25:11.702 --> 01:25:16.444]  But if you vaccinate and you have a reaction, you cannot unvaccinate.
[01:25:16.504 --> 01:25:17.945]  And health doesn't come through a needle.
[01:25:18.065 --> 01:25:18.645]  We know that.
[01:25:19.005 --> 01:25:21.607]  Illnesses come and go, health does not come through a needle.
[01:25:21.907 --> 01:25:24.228]  And you can vaccinate and you can still get the disease.
[01:25:24.808 --> 01:25:26.709]  And each shot is really like Russian roulette.
[01:25:27.461 --> 01:25:29.384]  You never know when you're going to get the bullet to your head.
[01:25:30.445 --> 01:25:36.193]  And if pro-vaccine folks claim that reactions are one in a million, they're referring to the most serious reactions.
[01:25:36.533 --> 01:25:41.840]  They never mention the millions of reactions that cause problems that do not result into death.
[01:25:42.441 --> 01:25:47.384]  So I believe that there's thousands that have never vaccinated, but I think it's a rare parent who wishes that they would.
[01:25:47.404 --> 01:25:52.728]  And I think that all the information in here is so concise and that there are so many links.
[01:25:52.848 --> 01:25:59.692]  And if people want to go directly to the document, if they go to dr10penny.com on the home page, there's a link to the document.
[01:25:59.993 --> 01:26:03.295]  There's a link to where you can sign up for your support of the document.
[01:26:03.915 --> 01:26:16.240]  And I think that we can get a lot of traction out of this, Alex, to get a huge number of healthcare workers to come out of the closet and stand up to say, I don't want to be vaccinated in order to get a job.
[01:26:16.701 --> 01:26:22.943]  I want a lot of parents to come forth and say, I don't want my kids vaccinated in order to go to a very expensive college education.
[01:26:23.423 --> 01:26:26.825]  We've got to be able to ensure that people have the right to say no.
[01:26:28.646 --> 01:26:31.528]  Well, I totally agree, and of course our IQs are dropping.
[01:26:31.768 --> 01:26:36.330]  When you talk about us having one of the most unhealthy populations in the world, no one can deny it.
[01:26:36.811 --> 01:26:41.894]  You've got Bayer Pharmaceutical caught for 10 years shipping out Factor VIII knowing it had HIV and hepatitis.
[01:26:42.334 --> 01:26:45.756]  I mean, it's time for these groups to be held accountable and to stop getting away with it.
[01:26:46.317 --> 01:26:48.981]  Absolutely, and accountability is the thing.
[01:26:49.061 --> 01:26:52.145]  I mean, they are so protected by the government, everybody from the top down.
[01:26:52.465 --> 01:26:58.173]  The pharmaceutical industries are protected, the doctors, the nurses at the public health department, everybody is protected.
[01:26:58.253 --> 01:27:00.136]  What other industry out there is like that?
[01:27:00.496 --> 01:27:00.756]  None!
[01:27:01.237 --> 01:27:12.027]  A number of the two reports out of Canada, prestigious groups, found that there was a doubling of your chances of getting the regular flu, a lowering of the overall immune system, if you had the H1N1 shot.
[01:27:12.047 --> 01:27:21.156]  I know that's a dovetail into why vaccinated children have far worse health outcomes than unvaccinated children, and then you link to all the numbers and facts.
[01:27:22.257 --> 01:27:24.399]  Encapsulate that key point for folks.
[01:27:24.957 --> 01:27:31.541]  It's really important to understand that the vaccines, they do really lower your immune system and make you more susceptible.
[01:27:31.842 --> 01:27:38.986]  Like you just said, the reports came out that if you got the H1N1 vaccine, it increased your risk of having the flu.
[01:27:39.387 --> 01:27:48.973]  And if flu shots were so good for us, and if all these other vaccines were so good for us, why is it that the government has to pass laws in order to require us to have them?
[01:27:48.993 --> 01:27:54.817]  I mean, if it was so good for us and it made us so healthy, there wouldn't even be this controversy.
[01:27:55.237 --> 01:28:04.439]  But the government is not willing to put money on the line to do a vaccinated children versus unvaccinated children study to look at the health groups of that.
[01:28:04.839 --> 01:28:11.141]  And there's actually an organization in Europe that is actually doing an online poll of unvaccinated children.
[01:28:11.481 --> 01:28:22.484]  They've got 3,800 case reports so far in their database, so they're crunching the numbers and asking very simple questions like, if your child is unvaccinated by the age of five,
[01:28:23.024 --> 01:28:25.106]  How many doses of antibiotics have they been on?
[01:28:25.446 --> 01:28:27.608]  How many times have they been to the hospital?
[01:28:27.929 --> 01:28:30.771]  Are they on any chronic long-term medications?
[01:28:31.052 --> 01:28:40.901]  Things that are very quantifiable that we can demonstrate that the health of unvaccinated children is much superior to the health of those children who are fully vaccinated.
[01:28:41.363 --> 01:28:54.571]  Well, it's also important, this is mirrored at Natural News, at DrTinPinney.com, I'm going to mirror the report at InfoWars.com, and PrisonPlanet.com, I'm going to have my webmasters post the detailed report right there, and also link back to you guys.
[01:28:54.911 --> 01:29:03.516]  It's important for everybody to not just have this information and then keep it for ourselves, you know, print it out, give it to people at gas stations, bring it to your pastor.
[01:29:04.037 --> 01:29:10.140]  If we the people get the word out, nothing can stop us, and Dr. TinPinney, I know you do this tirelessly, you know,
[01:29:11.857 --> 01:29:16.124]  With no pay for creating this free report you've spent a year making.
[01:29:16.404 --> 01:29:18.427]  You're a very successful doctor in your own right.
[01:29:19.308 --> 01:29:21.432]  And we just salute you for what you've done.
[01:29:25.953 --> 01:29:31.737]  No, no, we appreciate you and I look forward to getting you back for a full hour in the near future to go over the entire report in detail.
[01:29:32.038 --> 01:29:35.660]  But this has been a true public service announcement for everybody out there listening.
[01:29:35.780 --> 01:29:37.562]  Dr. Tenpenny, let me say bye to you during the break.
[01:29:37.822 --> 01:29:44.227]  We'll be right back with your phone calls and a ton of news as we look towards the Middle East and North Africa and the rebellions spreading.
[01:29:49.210 --> 01:29:50.131]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.611 --> 01:29:52.113]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.121 --> 01:29:55.882]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:58.904 --> 01:30:00.525]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:30:00.565 --> 01:30:03.366]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.

[01:30:50.962 --> 01:30:51.462]  Thank you!
[01:30:58.612 --> 01:31:00.896]  Folks, you've heard us talk about Home Gain before.

[01:31:58.197 --> 01:32:01.501]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[01:32:01.761 --> 01:32:02.842]  It ended on June of 2009.
[01:32:02.902 --> 01:32:07.267]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[01:32:07.467 --> 01:32:13.113]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[01:32:13.414 --> 01:32:15.396]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[01:32:15.576 --> 01:32:18.239]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[01:32:18.579 --> 01:32:24.882]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoodsDirect.
[01:32:25.082 --> 01:32:26.882]  They both make fabulous investments.
[01:32:27.282 --> 01:32:32.364]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[01:32:32.645 --> 01:32:37.626]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[01:32:37.907 --> 01:32:43.089]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[01:32:44.249 --> 01:32:44.929]  We're good to go.
[01:33:46.422 --> 01:33:48.183]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:49.624 --> 01:33:57.450]  It is Tuesday, the first day of February, 2011, already into the second month of 2011, and we're going in through and beyond.
[01:33:57.470 --> 01:34:06.077]  We're going to be mirroring that important report for posterity, so you can get it out to everybody at InfoWars.com from Dr. Sherry Tenpenny.
[01:34:06.117 --> 01:34:10.340]  I cannot stress enough that this is a devastating report documenting
[01:34:11.181 --> 01:34:22.050]  Big Pharma buying off media and government, knowing it's hurting people, getting liability protection so they can hurt people, and their move to try to force vaccination, not just here in the U.S., but worldwide.
[01:34:22.571 --> 01:34:24.312]  All the proof is there.
[01:34:24.672 --> 01:34:28.175]  And it's up to you, and you've done a great job, to carry the ball.
[01:34:29.127 --> 01:34:38.829]  to get this information out to everyone and to expose the globalists and their medical, eugenical tyranny that they're carrying out.
[01:34:39.409 --> 01:34:43.851]  Okay, obviously Jordan's monarchy has replaced government in reaction to protests.
[01:34:43.871 --> 01:34:45.931]  Kurt Nemos got the report on that.
[01:34:46.351 --> 01:34:51.012]  Also the AP reporting Jordan's king fires cabinet amid protest.
[01:34:51.392 --> 01:34:53.593]  Yeah, it's an appointed government by the monarchy.
[01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:55.800]  And their monarchy runs things.
[01:34:56.521 --> 01:34:57.881]  And their people are angry.
[01:34:58.461 --> 01:35:07.984]  And the West knows that there's major rebellions doing, so they're trying in Egypt and other places to maneuver their people into place.
[01:35:08.444 --> 01:35:12.245]  We're seeing cryptic statements by George Soros, by the usual suspects.
[01:35:12.805 --> 01:35:18.990]  I like Kissinger bragging about how this is a play and that this is only the first scene and the first act.
[01:35:19.030 --> 01:35:20.251]  The whole world is a stage.
[01:35:20.312 --> 01:35:23.554]  Each of us players upon it, as William Shakespeare wrote.
[01:35:24.615 --> 01:35:30.981]  CFR's Gelb says Egyptian protesters cannot be trusted, that the Muslim Brotherhood's involved.
[01:35:31.001 --> 01:35:33.002]  Well, it turns out they're being funded by our own governments.
[01:35:34.063 --> 01:35:37.405]  Continuing here, Mubarak may flee to Israel, not Saudi Arabia.
[01:35:37.965 --> 01:35:40.626]  The press is reporting corporate U.S.
[01:35:40.986 --> 01:35:45.268]  media's woeful, sanitized Egypt coverage amounts to censorship.
[01:35:45.569 --> 01:35:47.149]  Another report by Steve Watson.
[01:35:47.550 --> 01:35:50.311]  Massive crowds across Egypt demand Mubarak ouster.
[01:35:50.631 --> 01:35:52.332]  Still up in the air what's going to happen with him.
[01:35:53.612 --> 01:35:57.694]  He's been reshuffling his cabinet as if that's a change.
[01:35:58.414 --> 01:36:01.235]  Iran says Egypt events herald Islamic Middle East.
[01:36:01.595 --> 01:36:02.716]  They like what's happening.
[01:36:03.476 --> 01:36:07.838]  Continuing, Muslim Brotherhood says prepare Egyptians for war with Israel.
[01:36:08.498 --> 01:36:10.819]  They're admittedly run by Western and British intelligence.
[01:36:11.727 --> 01:36:13.808]  Again, they want this to be unstable.
[01:36:13.848 --> 01:36:17.429]  They want to bring in a crisis in the Middle East.
[01:36:17.489 --> 01:36:20.070]  Great story from Eric Blair at Infowars.com.
[01:36:20.490 --> 01:36:24.791]  The Faro will fall, oil will climb, and Wall Street will win.
[01:36:24.811 --> 01:36:27.912]  And he breaks down why they stand to gain from that.
[01:36:27.932 --> 01:36:29.233]  And then we have all these disgusting...
[01:36:30.501 --> 01:36:30.721]  I think?
[01:36:46.206 --> 01:36:52.133]  They're just openly admitting that they're running him and trying to put him in, and that the less triggered these protests.
[01:36:52.494 --> 01:36:54.977]  It isn't saying there aren't legitimate reasons to protest.
[01:36:54.997 --> 01:36:59.302]  The point is that globalists have created this dictator, propped him up for 30 years.
[01:36:59.703 --> 01:37:03.107]  Now they're trying to give him a new, fresh face.
[01:37:04.268 --> 01:37:05.889]  Just incredible that that's going on.
[01:37:05.909 --> 01:37:07.790]  But right now, let's go to your phone calls then.
[01:37:07.810 --> 01:37:10.311]  We've got David Icke coming up in about 25 minutes.
[01:37:10.972 --> 01:37:17.355]  And we also have got a bunch of other important news we're going to be breaking down on the economic front right now.
[01:37:17.635 --> 01:37:19.416]  Anna Marie in New York, you're on the air.
[01:37:20.657 --> 01:37:20.917]  Alex?
[01:37:21.257 --> 01:37:21.817]  Hey, welcome!
[01:37:22.718 --> 01:37:23.658]  Hey Alex, how are you?
[01:37:23.758 --> 01:37:25.039]  Pleasure to finally talk to you.
[01:37:25.379 --> 01:37:25.940]  Good to talk to you.
[01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:26.460]  What's on your mind?
[01:37:27.307 --> 01:37:28.948]  I got two comments I wanted to make.
[01:37:29.609 --> 01:37:31.951]  First of all, I wanted to let you know that I am a Christian.
[01:37:32.011 --> 01:37:35.233]  I've been listening to you for several years now.
[01:37:35.534 --> 01:37:37.355]  I am a hardcore Infra-Warrior gal.
[01:37:38.116 --> 01:37:40.437]  And finally I've woken up to the tyranny.
[01:37:40.858 --> 01:37:41.738]  And I thank you for that.
[01:37:42.819 --> 01:37:49.464]  My other comment is that I turned my calendar this morning to the new month of February 1st, 2011.
[01:37:49.905 --> 01:37:52.327]  And on my calendar it says National Freedom Day.
[01:37:52.667 --> 01:37:54.248]  And I kind of thought that was a little bit of a joke.
[01:37:54.689 --> 01:37:56.290]  Because we have no freedoms left.
[01:37:56.810 --> 01:37:58.933]  We have nothing but tyranny left in this country.
[01:37:59.373 --> 01:38:01.316]  And I'm just wondering what they're going to say on next year's calendar.
[01:38:01.356 --> 01:38:03.278]  Is it going to be National Communist Day?
[01:38:03.579 --> 01:38:05.040]  And then maybe the following year National... No, no.
[01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:07.443]  What they do is they never call tyranny tyranny.
[01:38:07.483 --> 01:38:09.305]  They call it new freedom.
[01:38:10.006 --> 01:38:13.831]  That's what they called six years ago the government's move to try to medicate
[01:38:14.031 --> 01:38:15.593]  Half of American school children.
[01:38:15.913 --> 01:38:17.195]  That's in the New Freedom Initiative.
[01:38:17.495 --> 01:38:20.959]  It's a new freedom to be a mind-numbed zombie.
[01:38:20.979 --> 01:38:25.164]  But we still have a lot of freedoms left because they live in us and we're exercising them.
[01:38:25.184 --> 01:38:34.575]  But there's no doubt the system, the ruling political class, is trying to overturn every bedrock canon of a free society.
[01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:44.445]  That's absolutely true, and I feel the same way, and I'm just so shocked every day that what goes on that sometimes I feel completely helpless that, you know, what can I do?
[01:38:44.525 --> 01:38:53.009]  I mean, I've spread the word, I've done so much, but yet I feel at some level that it's not working, that we're kind of falling, but that's a lie, that's a lie from Satan himself.
[01:38:53.689 --> 01:38:56.591]  Anna, you've got to look at the growth curve.
[01:38:56.831 --> 01:39:01.834]  They've been setting this tyranny up for a long time, taking over society, becoming wealthy from it, and
[01:39:02.754 --> 01:39:03.054]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[01:39:03.074 --> 01:39:03.814]  How are you doing today?
[01:39:29.608 --> 01:39:34.109]  I'm really amazed at your boldness and your courage and everything you do.
[01:39:34.829 --> 01:39:38.710]  I just wanted to make a few statements on the inoculation.
[01:39:39.210 --> 01:39:45.672]  I mean, it goes back to the swine flu, the Hong Kong flu in 1977, and then as me and you probably had that, I think it was 17 in one shot.
[01:39:50.461 --> 01:39:50.641]  I think?
[01:40:11.963 --> 01:40:15.746]  Dead fetal tissue, cancer viruses.
[01:40:15.806 --> 01:40:22.110]  I mean, it's incredible what they're pumping into us and that's why they go to the government and get liability protection.
[01:40:22.551 --> 01:40:25.132]  I mean, would you buy a car that had liability protection?
[01:40:25.553 --> 01:40:31.477]  Imagine if there was a car company that was allowed to make cars that could have exploding gas tanks and brakes that don't work.
[01:40:31.537 --> 01:40:33.258]  I mean, it's crazy.
[01:40:35.019 --> 01:40:35.500]  Exactly.
[01:40:36.761 --> 01:40:38.722]  But back in our day,
[01:40:40.273 --> 01:40:45.356]  Well, there actually are quite a few studies that show that it causes autoimmune responses in the joints.
[01:41:00.191 --> 01:41:08.456]  And that's one of the contributing factors along with sodium fluoride for the epidemic of early onset or new types of arthritis.
[01:41:08.476 --> 01:41:09.897]  Appreciate the call, David.
[01:41:10.317 --> 01:41:13.399]  Let's talk to Jonathan in Kansas.
[01:41:13.459 --> 01:41:14.560]  Jonathan, you're on the air.
[01:41:15.981 --> 01:41:16.821]  Yes, Alex.
[01:41:17.341 --> 01:41:26.327]  Did you know that the Spokane MLK Parade, the bomb that was planted, had an anti-blood clotting agent in it?
[01:41:28.223 --> 01:41:29.023]  No, I didn't know that.
[01:41:29.064 --> 01:41:36.848]  I remember hearing about a supposed bomb, and usually those are government provocateurs or government doing it, but they had a bunch of bomb scares a few weeks ago.
[01:41:37.468 --> 01:41:41.771]  But I can pull up an article, and it had an anti-blood clotting agent in it?
[01:41:42.651 --> 01:41:44.652]  Well, you can actually pull up the video.
[01:41:44.752 --> 01:41:47.534]  It's on YouTube.
[01:41:48.114 --> 01:41:49.735]  It's like a local news thing.
[01:41:49.775 --> 01:41:57.900]  It's called, look up on YouTube, called, Bomb Planted at Spokane MLK Parade Had
[01:41:58.783 --> 01:42:01.005]  Anti-blood clotting chemical agent.
[01:42:01.486 --> 01:42:11.815]  And basically, what came to my mind was when you had Frederick Whitehurst, he talked about how they had anti-blood clotting agents.
[01:42:12.075 --> 01:42:15.458]  You know, that's something they have at crime labs.
[01:42:15.618 --> 01:42:19.561]  They may be some police provocateur.
[01:42:20.868 --> 01:42:21.769]  Something like that.
[01:42:41.912 --> 01:42:56.546]  the platelets into hemophiliacs and others that have similar blood disorders, and they knowingly knew that every ampule of it for more than a decade had HIV and different types of hepatitis in it, and that it was a death sentence for those that took it.
[01:42:56.566 --> 01:43:02.712]  So that's the type of anti-blood clotting agent that I was talking about is a biological one not a chemical one.
[01:43:04.233 --> 01:43:12.843]  But expanding on that, Whitehurst was talking mainly about blood preservatives that they put in blood samples.
[01:43:12.863 --> 01:43:14.044]  We're talking about OJ Simpson.
[01:43:14.425 --> 01:43:20.732]  Whether you love him or hate him, the police did take blood samples from him and then go plant it because it was confirmed that that very
[01:43:21.592 --> 01:43:26.956]  Preservative was in the blood that that the LAPD used that they had taken blood samples from him.
[01:43:27.216 --> 01:43:33.020]  Of course Whitehurst talked about crime labs all over the country and the FBI crime lab just framing people in mass.
[01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:33.761]  I appreciate your call.
[01:43:33.981 --> 01:43:35.922]  That's what's so dangerous about DNA testing.
[01:43:36.142 --> 01:43:38.284]  They can just say that they got a positive or a negative.
[01:43:39.605 --> 01:43:40.966]  It's such a culture of lying.
[01:43:41.006 --> 01:43:44.909]  I have another news report here that Paul Watson put together.
[01:43:46.007 --> 01:43:49.269]  And it links to the actual videos of the testimonies.
[01:43:49.670 --> 01:43:53.832]  Ski mask wearing thug assists police at checkpoint in Houston County.
[01:43:55.634 --> 01:43:58.576]  And it shows a checkpoint on a highway, and I appreciate your call.
[01:44:00.322 --> 01:44:28.589]  uh... jonathan it shows a checkpoint on a highway where the police just pull your cars into a church parking lot and i've seen checkpoints like this myself i've been directed into them in texas and there's lawsuits in the court say they can't do it but the feds come in and give them grants and the cops still do it and it's this cop running around with other police says state police with no badge with a mask on in fact i can show folks a shot of that if you're watching on prison planet dot tv and you scroll down they have the testimony
[01:44:29.289 --> 01:44:29.890]  I don't know.
[01:44:48.488 --> 01:44:51.290]  I mean, let's go back to just a couple years ago.
[01:44:51.330 --> 01:44:55.053]  The Dallas Police Department, this was on the news, framed thousands.
[01:44:55.093 --> 01:45:01.757]  They would pull over a nice car, randomly, throw a bag of chalk in the back, or real cocaine, and then take your car.
[01:45:02.398 --> 01:45:08.802]  Then they would get a warrant for your house, throw a bag of chalk at your house, and take it, and then cops would get a percentage of it.
[01:45:09.623 --> 01:45:11.905]  See, under state law in all 50 states,
[01:45:12.867 --> 01:45:15.669]  The Feds got a federal law passed and then got states to adopt it.
[01:45:16.449 --> 01:45:20.211]  Police don't get basically any of the money if they seize it at the state level.
[01:45:20.931 --> 01:45:29.636]  But then the Feds pass another law that if they give the money to the Feds or the cars or homes of the Feds, then they can give up to 80% back to the local police.
[01:45:29.936 --> 01:45:32.157]  So that also incentivizes federalizing police.
[01:45:32.918 --> 01:45:40.302]  And when you realize that the Dallas Crime Lab, the Thulea, Texas Crime Lab, the San Antonio Crime Lab, just where I live,
[01:45:41.042 --> 01:45:43.063]  Uh, the San Francisco Crime Lab last year.
[01:45:43.083 --> 01:45:44.563]  That's what we had Frederick Weiters back on.
[01:45:45.044 --> 01:45:48.405]  Every major crime lab, they just frame people en masse.
[01:45:48.825 --> 01:45:49.886]  I mean, it is normal.
[01:45:50.286 --> 01:45:56.748]  And how many squad car videos have you seen where the cops catch themselves, where they'll pull out drugs and then plant it on somebody?
[01:45:57.849 --> 01:45:59.529]  Now, is that saying all cops are doing this?
[01:46:00.330 --> 01:46:00.490]  No.
[01:46:02.045 --> 01:46:08.572]  But, just in my experience in high school, and I was somebody that liked to drink beer when I could get it.
[01:46:08.892 --> 01:46:10.053]  I did not like marijuana.
[01:46:10.073 --> 01:46:12.957]  You know, I've tried marijuana off and on.
[01:46:12.997 --> 01:46:14.618]  Every time I try it, I don't like it.
[01:46:14.638 --> 01:46:19.563]  You know, my thing is coffee, cigarettes, and alcohol, and I've, you know, off and on quit all of those.
[01:46:19.964 --> 01:46:23.307]  It's a real battle, but the issue is I was a clean guy.
[01:46:24.324 --> 01:46:32.209]  And I saw the police coming to parties, delivering drugs, and then I would be pulled over an hour later, and they'd dig around in the bottom of the truck.
[01:46:32.449 --> 01:46:36.512]  When I'd be riding around with friends, they'd find a six-pack of beer and start putting us in handcuffs.
[01:46:37.173 --> 01:46:45.838]  And I shot my mouth off to them and, you know, said, said, you know, you guys are dealing drugs.
[01:46:47.419 --> 01:46:51.162]  How dare you, you know, take us to jail?
[01:46:51.742 --> 01:46:53.564]  And as a juvenile, I was taken a couple times for beer.
[01:46:56.055 --> 01:46:56.856]  I mean, I know you.
[01:46:57.056 --> 01:46:57.857]  You're a drug dealer.
[01:46:59.198 --> 01:47:03.002]  And they would just turn red and just go, you're lucky somebody didn't hang you in your cell.
[01:47:03.362 --> 01:47:10.309]  Then my dad's lawyer called him and said they are threatening that he'll be found hung in a cell if you don't leave Rockwall, Texas.
[01:47:10.449 --> 01:47:11.450]  And we moved because of that.
[01:47:11.671 --> 01:47:13.432]  And thank God, I love Austin compared to Dallas.
[01:47:14.133 --> 01:47:15.514]  But I mean, I have experienced this.
[01:47:15.975 --> 01:47:16.876]  I experienced
[01:47:18.305 --> 01:47:37.187]  During that whole time of this happening, being called down to the office by the school cop, closing the door in the principal's office, nobody in the room, him slamming me down on the table, put me in handcuffs, slamming me down, and telling me that I was going to go to prison, that I was going to be raped and get AIDS, and that I better shut my mouth about cop drug dealing.
[01:47:38.038 --> 01:47:46.485]  And then John McWhorter, right around that time, the sheriff got caught in drug dealing, and other police got caught.
[01:47:46.986 --> 01:48:04.961]  And my dad had a little Cessna out at the airport at the time, and he knew the old World War II vet that ran it, and that old vet, who my dad took flying lessons from, learned how to fly from, well actually my dad learned how to fly first when he lived out in East Texas from a World War II vet when he was like 14, but then he went back because after he hadn't been flying for a decade or whatever, you gotta go back and get it.
[01:48:06.704 --> 01:48:07.105]  We're good to go.
[01:48:24.721 --> 01:48:38.553]  Be up on the balcony, and there'd be a cop in his uniform, in his private truck, and the cheerleader would go down and get in the car and buy ecstasy, marijuana, cocaine, you name it from him, and they'd come back in the party and go crazy.
[01:48:40.174 --> 01:48:41.195]  People are like, you want some of this?
[01:48:41.255 --> 01:48:42.356]  I'm like, no way.
[01:48:42.736 --> 01:48:43.537]  No way.
[01:48:44.821 --> 01:48:46.602]  You know, don't get me near that stuff.
[01:48:46.943 --> 01:48:51.386]  Because I got one time, actually twice, they said, come on, do some cocaine.
[01:48:52.047 --> 01:48:54.489]  And I'd do it and feel like a car wreck.
[01:48:54.649 --> 01:48:56.410]  You ever had a bad car wreck or seen a car wreck?
[01:48:56.430 --> 01:49:00.613]  There's people chopped up and hurt and you're like totally awake but freaked out and feel dirty?
[01:49:01.714 --> 01:49:06.458]  That's what cocaine felt like to me, but for some people they obviously like it, but I don't know why I'm getting off on this whole story.
[01:49:07.078 --> 01:49:11.701]  The issue here is we must decriminalize drugs now.
[01:49:12.082 --> 01:49:22.609]  Imagine, you're riding down the road, there's a sign, there's a checkpoint, the cops are directing cars randomly into a parking lot, and then they just start tearing your car apart and they're wearing black masks.
[01:49:23.930 --> 01:49:27.433]  And then, they plant drugs on you.
[01:49:30.459 --> 01:49:31.639]  I experienced this.
[01:49:31.699 --> 01:49:32.739]  They never planted drugs on me.
[01:49:32.759 --> 01:49:34.420]  They told me they were going to plant drugs on me.
[01:49:34.740 --> 01:49:37.300]  Or that they were going to plant, quote, stolen stereo equipment.
[01:49:37.780 --> 01:49:39.781]  And I said to the cop, I said, you know I don't do drugs.
[01:49:40.361 --> 01:49:41.681]  You guys know full well who I am.
[01:49:41.721 --> 01:49:43.061]  I said, you know I don't steal things.
[01:49:43.581 --> 01:49:44.902]  And they said, I don't care.
[01:49:45.502 --> 01:49:47.202]  You're going to be raped and get AIDS.
[01:49:47.922 --> 01:49:49.262]  You little, you know, bleeper.
[01:49:49.882 --> 01:49:53.523]  And he had me over the desk, slamming my head into the desk.
[01:49:54.323 --> 01:49:56.384]  And leaning on me and telling me this stuff.
[01:49:56.904 --> 01:49:58.484]  This is what runs America.
[01:49:59.434 --> 01:50:01.976]  Why do you think they make the drugs illegal?
[01:50:03.577 --> 01:50:04.998]  So they get huge profits.
[01:50:05.078 --> 01:50:12.224]  Why did the mafia lobby and use a lot of foolish squares to help get it pushed through in the churches to make alcohol illegal?
[01:50:13.065 --> 01:50:20.771]  Because when they made something illegal that half the population was into, a beer wasn't a nickel anymore in 1925.
[01:50:21.851 --> 01:50:22.892]  A beer was a dollar.
[01:50:23.893 --> 01:50:24.694]  Look up the numbers.
[01:50:25.742 --> 01:50:29.323]  You know, you could buy a bottle of gin for maybe 50 cents.
[01:50:29.883 --> 01:50:31.044]  Now a bottle of gin might be $5.
[01:50:31.364 --> 01:50:33.664]  Do the math.
[01:50:33.884 --> 01:50:37.445]  They want it illegal so they can control it and make money off of it.
[01:50:37.726 --> 01:50:39.866]  And they don't want people talking about this.
[01:50:40.546 --> 01:50:47.909]  But in my experience growing up in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, this is what I experienced.
[01:50:48.329 --> 01:50:50.389]  And I wasn't even in the drug culture.
[01:50:50.749 --> 01:50:52.610]  I just saw this at parties and things.
[01:50:54.195 --> 01:50:57.858]  The cops are so arrogant, they deliver drugs in police uniforms!
[01:50:59.100 --> 01:51:00.361]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:00.401 --> 01:51:05.766]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:05.986 --> 01:51:10.631]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:11.011 --> 01:51:14.074]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[01:51:14.294 --> 01:51:16.056]  And it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:51:16.576 --> 01:51:21.257]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:21.797 --> 01:51:23.718]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:51:24.098 --> 01:51:28.699]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:28.899 --> 01:51:29.799]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:30.019 --> 01:51:32.800]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:51:33.100 --> 01:51:36.381]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:36.701 --> 01:51:39.543]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:39.883 --> 01:51:41.784]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[01:51:43.205 --> 01:51:46.187]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:46.707 --> 01:51:48.429]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:58.715 --> 01:52:04.899]  This message starts with a great offer from Big Berkey Water Filters, because we don't want you drinking dangerous water one minute longer.

[01:52:58.775 --> 01:53:02.259]  Most of us eat a blend of processed, man-made, and all-natural food.
[01:53:02.579 --> 01:53:06.183]  But the food you eat may not provide all the nutrition your body needs.
[01:53:06.484 --> 01:53:10.328]  We now know that liquid vitamin supplements are absorbed faster than pills.
[01:53:10.648 --> 01:53:11.589]  That's why you need...
[01:53:13.582 --> 01:53:14.463]  Sea Energy.
[01:53:14.763 --> 01:53:24.371]  From AffinitySeaEnergy.com, sea vegetation is known to be the richest source of organic minerals, and that's what you'll find in all-natural, great-tasting Sea Energy.
[01:53:24.591 --> 01:53:34.640]  Sea Energy contains aloe vera, black cherry, cranberry, and pomegranate juices, plus ginseng, cat's claw, ginger, gingko biloba, and over 50 trace minerals.
[01:53:35.020 --> 01:53:35.340]  I think so.
[01:54:25.825 --> 01:54:41.634]  By the way, we've been so busy covering world events and had so many great guests on, and David Icke's coming on at 8 after, we'll take calls this segment and the next, and continue with David, that I haven't even gotten into how successful the Answer to 1984, the 1776 video contest.
[01:54:42.074 --> 01:54:43.115]  That's the contest for $10,000.
[01:54:43.235 --> 01:54:49.298]  You got, what, three more weeks to get your video entries in, to shoot video of your activism, or
[01:54:50.782 --> 01:54:57.304]  Whatever is most creative idea of exposing the DHS-TSA occupation of America.
[01:54:58.185 --> 01:55:04.687]  Separately, I launched the V for Victory campaign and said, look, you're welcome to incorporate that into your contest if you want.
[01:55:05.107 --> 01:55:06.548]  I don't know if that'll be who the winner is.
[01:55:06.948 --> 01:55:10.870]  You can read the contest rules at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:55:11.350 --> 01:55:17.132]  The V campaign is just to get locals talking about tyranny and trying to get liberty back.
[01:55:17.572 --> 01:55:22.253]  And we're getting just, I don't know, 10, 15, 20 videos a day that are incredible coming in.
[01:55:22.694 --> 01:55:24.914]  People are making hundreds and hundreds and hundreds a week.
[01:55:24.954 --> 01:55:26.055]  I can't even keep track of them all.
[01:55:26.275 --> 01:55:32.337]  We post new ones every day at Infowars.com with different art using the V for victory against tyranny.
[01:55:33.017 --> 01:55:39.519]  The biggest issue here is doing banner hangs or doing it in public places where it's legal and lawful.
[01:55:40.814 --> 01:55:44.577]  So that the media covers it to get that going.
[01:55:44.597 --> 01:55:47.399]  That's the one part of the equation I haven't seen be successful yet.
[01:55:47.699 --> 01:55:54.524]  But as for it being posted on street corners all over the country and all over the internet and having a huge effect, I salute all of you.
[01:55:54.784 --> 01:56:01.148]  People are talking about V and resistance against tyranny and it is extremely, extremely exciting.
[01:56:02.549 --> 01:56:13.036]  We haven't taken the special down yet, and going up is the Ben Livingston interview with Expanded, never-before-seen footage dealing with weather modification and weather wars, weather manipulation and chemtrails.
[01:56:13.817 --> 01:56:17.659]  That video is going up tomorrow at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:56:18.660 --> 01:56:24.344]  A Dr. Nick Begich interview up in Alaska, they shot this weekend, is going to be going up in the next few weeks for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[01:56:25.685 --> 01:56:29.128]  Another expanded in-depth interview with G. Edward Griffin.
[01:56:30.250 --> 01:56:35.915]  Skull & Bones, Inside Skull & Bones, New Revelations, Inside the Annals via Charlotte Iserby.
[01:56:35.935 --> 01:56:37.157]  That's going up in the next few weeks.
[01:56:37.497 --> 01:56:40.180]  PrisonPlanet.tv and it is
[01:56:41.480 --> 01:56:42.021]  $5.95 a month.
[01:56:42.041 --> 01:56:44.562]  We've still got the special running because they haven't taken it down yet.
[01:56:44.962 --> 01:56:49.085]  Right now you can still get five plus months free at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:56:49.685 --> 01:56:53.467]  So be sure and check that out today at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:56:53.487 --> 01:57:04.334]  We've got the new V for Victory t-shirts, the Draft Ron Paul 2012 t-shirts that are limited edition, limited time, available at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:57:05.614 --> 01:57:07.415]  Let's take some calls in this segment and the next.
[01:57:07.736 --> 01:57:09.717]  Brian in North Carolina, you're on the air.
[01:57:10.933 --> 01:57:15.975]  Hi, this is Brian Hill from USWGO.com Alternative News.
[01:57:16.075 --> 01:57:16.775]  I'm a truther.
[01:57:16.795 --> 01:57:18.256]  Alright.
[01:57:18.916 --> 01:57:24.258]  Listen, I appreciate your call, Brian, but I really don't like folks giving their names out on air until I know who they really are.
[01:57:24.678 --> 01:57:27.799]  Just your tone sounded like it was going in the wrong direction, so thank you.
[01:57:28.319 --> 01:57:29.299]  Scott in Texas.
[01:57:29.359 --> 01:57:30.280]  Scott, you're on the air.
[01:57:30.340 --> 01:57:30.720]  Go ahead.
[01:57:31.520 --> 01:57:32.100]  Hi, Alex.
[01:57:32.881 --> 01:57:36.862]  Listen, I've listened to you talk with Webster Carpley and Gerald Salenti.
[01:57:37.700 --> 01:57:37.760]  Yes.
[01:57:37.780 --> 01:57:37.940]  Yes.
[01:57:55.515 --> 01:57:57.716]  I don't know that I heard everything Max had to say.
[01:57:57.736 --> 01:57:58.716]  Could you kind of elaborate?
[01:57:58.756 --> 01:58:03.497]  He thinks, he seems to think that we're going to collapse quicker than Webster.
[01:58:03.997 --> 01:58:04.957]  What's your take on all that?
[01:58:05.337 --> 01:58:10.479]  You know, I try to have a wide spectrum of experts who I respect on who've been accurate in the past.
[01:58:10.819 --> 01:58:17.580]  There's some difference of opinion, but the road we're going down is a mathematical certainty of insolvency and the end of the dollar.
[01:58:17.640 --> 01:58:24.022]  And the globalists have announced they want this new global cashless currency that all of our currencies will be basically valued in.
[01:58:24.802 --> 01:58:28.084]  Uh, and so they're bypassing right to the global digital currency.
[01:58:28.345 --> 01:58:29.866]  You'll still have your regional currency.
[01:58:30.146 --> 01:58:31.367]  It'll just be pegged to that.
[01:58:31.387 --> 01:58:32.367]  Does that answer your question?
[01:58:33.048 --> 01:58:33.528]  That's what I had.
[01:58:34.269 --> 01:58:35.490]  Uh, but, I mean, we got more to say.
[01:58:35.530 --> 01:58:35.890]  Stay there.
[01:58:35.910 --> 01:58:37.331]  If not, we'll be right back with more calls.
[01:58:40.453 --> 01:58:44.035]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:44.075 --> 01:58:45.937]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:48.789 --> 01:58:52.230]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[01:58:52.611 --> 01:58:56.652]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[01:58:56.892 --> 01:59:01.914]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[01:59:02.014 --> 01:59:06.756]  Not looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[01:59:07.537 --> 01:59:14.560]  Not worried about them moving south, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[01:59:17.333 --> 01:59:21.696]  I'm looking for America.
[01:59:22.837 --> 01:59:24.278]  Wear American and be proud.
[01:59:24.478 --> 01:59:27.180]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[01:59:27.240 --> 01:59:31.262]  Land I left free in the home of the brave.
[01:59:31.703 --> 01:59:36.826]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[01:59:43.266 --> 01:59:47.908]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[01:59:51.770 --> 01:59:53.690]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:54.151 --> 01:59:56.932]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:03.530 --> 02:00:07.714]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:08.374 --> 02:00:09.175]  You want answers?
[02:00:09.956 --> 02:00:10.856]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:11.497 --> 02:00:15.100]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:15.681 --> 02:00:19.744]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:21.005 --> 02:00:26.052]  I have believed from the very beginning these are real grassroots uprisings all over the Middle East, North Africa.
[02:00:26.552 --> 02:00:36.905]  But when the globalists came out and bragged that they were behind ElBaradei and others and are trying to take credit for it, clearly they knew that these rebellions were coming, so they triggered it to make sure their people got in.
[02:00:36.925 --> 02:00:37.226]  So I think...
[02:00:37.706 --> 02:00:42.107]  Everybody who's been looking at this from different perspectives has been right, just from different perspectives.
[02:00:42.447 --> 02:00:49.309]  Tarpley, you know, has been saying that he believes that it may fail, but it looks like he's wrong.
[02:00:49.349 --> 02:00:59.072]  The Drudge Report, right now, did just have a red link that Al Arabiya TV Network says it has reported that Egypt's Mubarak will not run for president again.
[02:00:59.132 --> 02:00:59.812]  More details.
[02:01:00.192 --> 02:01:05.714]  And now Drudge has up the Reuters article, Mubarak to give speech on Tuesday.
[02:01:06.634 --> 02:01:22.422]  On Al Arabiya TV, now that could be a trick to get the protesters to go away, to lose their momentum, and then we've seen politicians claim they're not going to run again, you know, for Senate or House when they get caught in bathrooms, you know, having sex or whatever, and then later they say they're now not going to quit.
[02:01:23.003 --> 02:01:23.923]  That could be a trick.
[02:01:24.984 --> 02:01:27.105]  Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak will give a speech
[02:01:29.665 --> 02:01:40.228]  On Tuesday, and that's supposedly today, after at least one million people rallied across the country clamoring for him to step down, Al Arabiya Television said there was no official confirmation.
[02:01:40.909 --> 02:01:54.173]  The channel also says that Vice President Omar Suleiman, but of course they already have been announcing on Al Jazeera and others, so this could be a self-fulfilling prophecy situation that he had fled to
[02:01:55.768 --> 02:01:58.169]  London, England, and then to Tel Aviv, Israel.
[02:01:59.270 --> 02:02:00.610]  And it turned out that wasn't true.
[02:02:00.710 --> 02:02:03.352]  So this could be a hoax, but we'll find out soon.
[02:02:03.632 --> 02:02:10.375]  But it could be a way to energize the protesters right as they are ebbing to believe that they've won.
[02:02:10.975 --> 02:02:14.717]  So I don't know what the truth is here about this, but we'll continue to track that.
[02:02:14.737 --> 02:02:24.542]  But reportedly, he's set to give a speech soon, in the next 24 hours or so, saying that he's going to step down in September and is going to get the country ready for transition into elections.
[02:02:25.362 --> 02:02:30.945]  Yeah, Alex, I've got to take you back to an interview about six years ago you did with the owner of a company, I think in California.
[02:02:30.965 --> 02:02:33.486]  He was the TCO of a credit card-sized speaker that
[02:02:50.037 --> 02:02:55.203]  Was a spin-off of a military weapon and could beam audio directly into your head.
[02:02:55.263 --> 02:02:57.726]  I know, that was 11 years ago with the CEO.
[02:02:58.086 --> 02:02:59.287]  They won't let them do it in the U.S.
[02:02:59.307 --> 02:03:04.293]  They do it in Japan where it beams audio directly to the brain out of Coke machines.
[02:03:04.333 --> 02:03:05.534]  Yeah, that was the MSNBC.
[02:03:06.525 --> 02:03:07.525]  Out of the wave machine.
[02:03:08.086 --> 02:03:21.651]  Now, the next big sale was it was discovered that audio in a classroom, children's classroom, the ones in the front of the class couldn't hear as good as the ones in the back of the class, so they were putting it into the public school classrooms.
[02:03:22.071 --> 02:03:23.992]  You're kidding, that was a mainstream news article?
[02:03:24.012 --> 02:03:32.616]  That was a mainstream news article, and shortly after that article, I believe you heard that a fifth grade class got up and rioted all at once.
[02:03:35.017 --> 02:03:35.817]  And they didn't know why.
[02:03:37.315 --> 02:03:41.938]  Well, I know that with the Pokemon TV show, they had tens of thousands of kids have convulsions.
[02:03:41.978 --> 02:03:44.539]  It was confirmed that the flickering rate was doing it.
[02:03:44.559 --> 02:03:49.062]  I mean, this is what they can do with the television, with audio, with these systems.
[02:03:49.282 --> 02:03:54.725]  And now Chicago announces they want to put fake bird tweets out to make everyone be calm.
[02:03:54.765 --> 02:03:57.687]  The government wants to put lithium in the water to make us calm.
[02:03:58.067 --> 02:04:02.410]  I mean, we're living in the 21st century, and we are living under more and more mind control.
[02:04:02.850 --> 02:04:05.571]  I saw, it's got to be 13 years ago, a
[02:04:06.812 --> 02:04:17.199]  Baltimore Sun article, where DARPA said, yes, we're testing towers that put out magnetic wavelengths that calm you during emergencies and civil unrest.
[02:04:17.739 --> 02:04:21.882]  I mean, so this is all out in the open, but it's kind of like spider goats.
[02:04:21.902 --> 02:04:25.165]  I'd talk about spider goats 15 years ago, CBS News, you name it.
[02:04:25.905 --> 02:04:28.026]  Part spider, part goat, creating body armor.
[02:04:28.507 --> 02:04:31.088]  And people would laugh at me, even though it's admitted.
[02:04:31.628 --> 02:04:33.670]  Because they just aren't ready to deal with it.
[02:04:34.030 --> 02:04:34.890]  That's interesting, Larry.
[02:04:34.930 --> 02:04:36.051]  I should look into those articles.
[02:04:36.071 --> 02:04:38.673]  Why don't you email them to us at ShowTipsAtInfoWars.com.
[02:04:39.733 --> 02:04:43.575]  Okay, can you tell me the name of the chief CEO or the name of the product?
[02:04:43.615 --> 02:04:44.296]  Can you remember it?
[02:04:44.864 --> 02:04:47.566]  No, I do remember it was an MSNBC article.
[02:04:47.646 --> 02:04:50.469]  My wife was my producer at the time and she just called him up and got him on.
[02:04:51.029 --> 02:04:56.654]  And there's articles about the advertising that targets the middle ear and transmits sound directly to your brain.
[02:04:57.395 --> 02:04:57.916]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:58.868 --> 02:05:03.111]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:05:03.411 --> 02:05:04.031]  Number one.
[02:05:04.331 --> 02:05:07.493]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:07.754 --> 02:05:08.334]  Number two.
[02:05:08.614 --> 02:05:13.177]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:05:13.517 --> 02:05:13.958]  It's true.
[02:05:14.258 --> 02:05:18.821]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:19.121 --> 02:05:19.681]  Number three.
[02:05:19.941 --> 02:05:23.243]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:05:23.544 --> 02:05:27.246]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:05:27.446 --> 02:05:27.986]  Number 4.
[02:05:28.227 --> 02:05:30.588]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:05:30.988 --> 02:05:34.370]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:05:34.670 --> 02:05:34.890]  Number 5.
[02:05:35.471 --> 02:05:39.393]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:05:39.613 --> 02:05:44.376]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:05:44.656 --> 02:05:48.679]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:05:48.839 --> 02:05:50.380]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:06:58.516 --> 02:07:02.479]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:07:02.699 --> 02:07:08.744]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:07:09.104 --> 02:07:16.209]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:07:16.490 --> 02:07:21.073]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[02:07:59.187 --> 02:08:03.932]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:04.293 --> 02:08:06.575]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:08.837 --> 02:08:11.300]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:08:11.420 --> 02:08:11.880]  until 2 p.m.
[02:08:11.900 --> 02:08:14.343]  Many days we go into the fourth hour of overdrive.
[02:08:14.683 --> 02:08:17.947]  We're here live, back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:08:18.387 --> 02:08:22.171]  The broadcast is exploding exponentially with A&M affiliates, XM,
[02:08:24.213 --> 02:08:35.261]  Record listenership online and it's all because of the work I've done, my crew, the staff, you the listeners, the sponsors, the great stations that are out there.
[02:08:35.301 --> 02:08:37.602]  Be sure and support our local Eminem affiliates.
[02:08:37.963 --> 02:08:49.671]  Spread the word about my show and other shows on those fine stations and support their sponsors because it's important that the alternative media and stations that stand up for the truth get the support they need to continue and expand.
[02:08:50.151 --> 02:08:53.415]  We're going to the one and only David Icke, who really needs no introduction here in a moment.
[02:08:54.116 --> 02:08:56.118]  I asked what he wanted to get into first and it's Egypt.
[02:08:56.138 --> 02:08:58.681]  That's what I wanted to get him on about, to get his view on.
[02:08:59.121 --> 02:09:00.983]  And so the former head of the Green Party...
[02:09:02.713 --> 02:09:06.314]  Championship goalie, best-selling author, researcher.
[02:09:07.174 --> 02:09:09.975]  He will be joining us for the balance of the hour here in a moment.
[02:09:09.995 --> 02:09:11.675]  I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors.
[02:09:11.695 --> 02:09:21.457]  Speaking of sponsors that make the transmission possible, End of America, the number three dot com, of course is breaking down the move away from the dollar that Hu Jintao has been talking about now.
[02:09:22.198 --> 02:09:28.239]  Stansbury and Associates Investment Research, an independent investment research firm founded in 99 with subscribers and more than a hundred different
[02:09:28.559 --> 02:09:40.903]  Nations they recently created an eye-opening video that you can see for free at end of America the number three dot-com That's end of America number three dot-com for free detailing their biggest and most important prediction yet.

[02:09:50.085 --> 02:09:51.786]  Germany buy locally
[02:09:52.591 --> 02:09:57.032]  The globalists want to de-industrialize you and make you dependent on, you know, foreign slave states.
[02:09:57.493 --> 02:10:05.275]  And a great place to find Made in America jeans and other apparel is gusset.com forward slash america diamond gusset jeans made in Tennessee and Georgia.

[02:10:36.042 --> 02:10:39.785]  Now, many have dubbed Ike as the most controversial speaker on the planet.
[02:10:39.845 --> 02:10:43.408]  Much of what he's talked about in the last 20 years has unfortunately come true.
[02:10:43.708 --> 02:10:48.311]  He deals with this false programmed matrix reality of disinformation we're fed.
[02:10:48.872 --> 02:10:54.936]  And his latest book is Human Race, Get Off Your Knees, The Lion Sleeps No More, DavidIke.com.
[02:10:55.377 --> 02:10:57.959]  And David, serious times coming.
[02:10:58.959 --> 02:11:01.501]  Well I think what we're seeing Alex is a classic
[02:11:22.424 --> 02:11:29.569]  Reformation or confirmation of something that anyone that wants to understand what's going on in the world must keep at the front of their mind.
[02:11:29.589 --> 02:11:33.652]  And that is, no situation is ever black and white.
[02:11:34.072 --> 02:11:38.175]  It's always, if you're looking for the real truth, it's a shade of grey.
[02:11:38.875 --> 02:11:40.476]  And that's what we're looking at here.
[02:11:40.757 --> 02:11:46.640]  We have, understandably, a, I believe, a genuine
[02:11:47.681 --> 02:11:48.322]  I think?
[02:12:06.994 --> 02:12:10.696]  Then suddenly you lose your fear, because what have I got to lose?
[02:12:10.736 --> 02:12:12.057]  I'm in this situation anyway.
[02:12:12.117 --> 02:12:26.145]  Now because of the massive economic collapse and catastrophe around the world, people in all parts of the world, not just the Middle East, are feeling that and they're heading closer and closer
[02:12:27.043 --> 02:12:30.484]  To that line that says, I've got nothing to lose, let's go.
[02:12:30.504 --> 02:12:44.629]  Now of course, the mind manipulators, because that's what it is in the end, a mind game, a psychological game, they knew that this was coming and they have got to try to manage it for their own ends.
[02:12:44.949 --> 02:12:47.690]  So here we have Alex, a genuine
[02:12:48.752 --> 02:12:57.659]  reaction to this 30 years of suppression and violence and tyranny by this U.S.
[02:12:57.759 --> 02:13:11.009]  and no doubt British too, the two go together, tyranny and dictator, Mubarak, who will serve their interests and serve the interests of Israel against the interests of the Palestinians.
[02:13:11.490 --> 02:13:15.613]  And that is a genuine reaction, no doubt, but you can see
[02:13:16.776 --> 02:13:29.705]  But when you've got a powder keg like that of resentment and oppression that will not take it anymore, then it's very easy to trigger that and then manipulate it.
[02:13:29.725 --> 02:13:44.234]  And that's why when the revolution truly comes to America and Britain, as it will, then we involved in any of that need to learn the lessons and become streetwise about the way this thing works.
[02:13:44.815 --> 02:13:46.196]  Because how many times
[02:13:46.976 --> 02:14:05.470]  When you look at these so-called people's revolutions, not least in the former Soviet Union, of Georgia, of Ukraine, of the Czech Republic, of Kyrgyzstan, and so on, these color revolutions as they call them, again and again it's been shown quite clearly
[02:14:06.230 --> 02:14:16.776]  But Rothschild-connected people like George Soros and Sierpigny Brzezinski have been behind them, not least Soros' network of foundations.
[02:14:16.836 --> 02:14:19.298]  They're not there for philanthropy.
[02:14:19.358 --> 02:14:28.924]  They are there to manipulate so-called, on the surface, people's revolutions that are putting their people in power.
[02:14:29.004 --> 02:14:31.125]  And you cannot ever judge
[02:14:31.781 --> 02:14:32.122]  I think so.
[02:14:45.427 --> 02:14:45.848]  I think?
[02:15:03.065 --> 02:15:04.586]  We have this extraordinarily ludicrous situation now.
[02:15:32.711 --> 02:15:53.545]  In the Ukraine, where I'm speaking next week, where a guy called Viktor Yanukovych was removed after what was claimed to be rigged elections in, I think it was 2004, the so-called Orange Revolution, that very man is now President of the country!
[02:15:53.565 --> 02:15:58.228]  So that revolution, of course, changed nothing with hindsight.
[02:15:58.608 --> 02:15:59.409]  And when you look at
[02:16:00.646 --> 02:16:07.691]  The situation now in Egypt, who turns up, not lived in the country for most of his adult life.
[02:16:07.731 --> 02:16:10.733]  Mohammed ElBaradei, the head of the UN.
[02:16:11.374 --> 02:16:12.575]  And who is this man?
[02:16:12.595 --> 02:16:27.606]  He's been on the board of the International Crisis Group, which claims on its website to be an independent, non-profit, non-governmental organization committed to preventing and solving deadly conflict, when it's actually there
[02:16:28.446 --> 02:16:32.190]  To manipulate regime change in the very way that I'm talking about.
[02:16:49.887 --> 02:16:51.208]  So this is what I wanted to ask you, David.
[02:16:51.228 --> 02:16:51.968]  I want you to continue.
[02:16:52.009 --> 02:16:53.850]  Do you agree with my analysis here?
[02:16:54.190 --> 02:17:04.137]  Because I knew this a decade ago because I saw them bragging about it, but now they've come out in Wired Magazine, you name it, and admitted Google is NSA software for keyword.
[02:17:04.657 --> 02:17:12.362]  They just get you to search the database to put your own information on it, so they literally know what you're thinking and doing, and Google says,
[02:17:13.383 --> 02:17:23.172]  Ninety-three to ninety-nine percent of the time, they know where you're going to eat, what you're going to surf, what you're going to do, more than you even know, and they're able to predict the future.
[02:17:23.232 --> 02:17:29.799]  It's a scientific crystal ball, to a certain extent, by tracking mass movements of people, and they knew
[02:17:30.379 --> 02:17:41.208]  That there was rebellion against all their dictators forming, and so they're going to trigger it early to then bring their people back in, and that's basically what's happened.
[02:17:41.228 --> 02:17:44.751]  But we'll put up on screen those articles about Google.
[02:17:45.252 --> 02:17:47.874]  It was now claiming they're getting companies where they can do this.
[02:17:48.194 --> 02:17:50.156]  That's what they've been set up to do all along.
[02:17:50.436 --> 02:17:57.803]  That's why the globalists are so arrogant, is because they literally do nothing but study humanity and how we operate.
[02:17:58.604 --> 02:18:18.104]  Yeah, well the International Crisis Group, board members, Chairman George Soros, Mohamed ElBaradei, Wesley Clarke, say no more, Yavier Solana, the NATO Secretary General as was, Sergei Brzezinski is one of their senior advisors, Richard Armitage, for goodness sake, and Prince Turkey Alfaisal.
[02:18:18.764 --> 02:18:27.752]  Who is a member of the Saudi Arabia royal family, who of course love democracy and freedom, which this international crisis group is supposed to represent.
[02:18:27.792 --> 02:18:33.077]  So you look at that, and it's quite clear that ElBaradei is their man.
[02:18:33.177 --> 02:18:36.921]  Now, also the Daily Telegraph in Britain has been running
[02:18:38.135 --> 02:18:38.856]  We're good to go.
[02:18:53.292 --> 02:18:59.097]  Kissinger came out on Bloomberg last night and said this is only the first scene in the first act of a play.
[02:19:18.274 --> 02:19:20.075]  That's exactly what I was coming to.
[02:19:20.676 --> 02:19:25.159]  That quote, this is only the first scene of the first act of the drama to be played out.
[02:19:25.599 --> 02:19:27.280]  That is telling you what's coming.
[02:19:27.780 --> 02:19:39.308]  And you see, I've been writing for years about the fact that these Arab oil states and these Arab dictatorships and royal dictatorships were being played like a violin.
[02:19:39.348 --> 02:19:40.709]  It was only a matter of time.
[02:19:41.529 --> 02:19:43.551]  And again, you come to the shades of grey.
[02:19:43.571 --> 02:19:46.132]  Should the dictators and royal
[02:19:47.293 --> 02:19:48.375]  Stay there, David.
[02:19:48.455 --> 02:19:49.497]  We gotta break it.
[02:19:49.537 --> 02:19:49.978]  Powerful info.
[02:19:50.038 --> 02:19:52.402]  We're gonna look at the geopolitical map when we come back.
[02:19:59.634 --> 02:20:02.756]  Forget everything you've been told about long-term food storage.
[02:20:02.977 --> 02:20:10.222]  When all hell breaks loose, you'll need the single most effective way to get high-powered Delta Force nutrients to your family, fast.
[02:20:10.962 --> 02:20:13.684]  Like any Special Forces commando, you need a plan.
[02:20:14.065 --> 02:20:16.306]  You need a Black Hawk Down food plan.
[02:20:16.607 --> 02:20:19.709]  Introducing the Survival Sprout Bank from Solutions from Science.
[02:20:20.009 --> 02:20:21.750]  It's your countertop survival garden.
[02:20:22.031 --> 02:20:26.274]  Yes, grow fresh greens right on your countertop in just a few short days.
[02:20:26.614 --> 02:20:33.440]  Sprouts are the green shoots that emerge from newly germinated seeds, and they are powerhouses of living, easily absorbed nutrients.
[02:20:33.680 --> 02:20:37.063]  The Survival Sprout Bank is a complete kit with nothing else to buy.
[02:20:37.283 --> 02:20:41.586]  And with sprouts so easy to grow, even children can grow emergency food.
[02:20:41.686 --> 02:20:43.088]  Call 877-327-0365 or go to survivalsproutbank.com.
[02:20:43.128 --> 02:20:43.348]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:20:48.652 --> 02:21:00.981]  They helped create a New World Order.
[02:21:01.001 --> 02:21:03.243]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:21:03.263 --> 02:21:06.165]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:21:06.585 --> 02:21:11.349]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:21:11.709 --> 02:21:15.892]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:21:16.192 --> 02:21:18.535]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:21:18.555 --> 02:21:21.078]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:21:21.438 --> 02:21:24.001]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:21:24.341 --> 02:21:31.950]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:21:32.290 --> 02:21:37.513]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:21:37.673 --> 02:21:40.475]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:21:40.515 --> 02:21:43.957]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:21:44.197 --> 02:21:45.118]  And I got news for you.
[02:21:45.278 --> 02:21:46.579]  You're everyone else.
[02:21:46.619 --> 02:21:47.659]  Invisible Empire.

[02:21:57.668 --> 02:21:58.108]  Gold.
[02:21:58.469 --> 02:21:59.730]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[02:21:59.990 --> 02:22:06.095]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:22:06.275 --> 02:22:10.099]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:22:10.439 --> 02:22:12.341]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:22:12.381 --> 02:22:14.683]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:22:14.823 --> 02:22:22.329]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[02:22:22.369 --> 02:22:23.150]  We're good to go.
[02:22:48.429 --> 02:22:52.473]  If you have ever thought about owning gold, you must read this report.
[02:23:12.131 --> 02:23:16.054]  It's inspiring for many who are affected by the recent downturn of the economy.
[02:23:16.214 --> 02:23:20.156]  I already knew a bit about foraging and edibles, but you take it to a whole new level.
[02:23:20.276 --> 02:23:22.798]  A thousand thanks to you for all that great knowledge.
[02:23:23.058 --> 02:23:23.979]  It was empowering.
[02:23:24.099 --> 02:23:27.981]  When I was in the Navy, I went through a couple of quick land survival classes.
[02:23:28.101 --> 02:23:30.883]  Thank you for being an inspiration and for all the work that you do.
[02:23:30.903 --> 02:23:33.645]  I really appreciate the depth and detail of the information.
[02:23:33.765 --> 02:23:34.586]  Thank you so much.
[02:23:34.746 --> 02:23:37.547]  Much love and respect to you from all of us here in the boonies.
[02:23:37.607 --> 02:23:38.188]  Thanks again.
[02:23:38.348 --> 02:23:40.970]  Knowledge is power, and that power brings peace.
[02:23:41.713 --> 02:23:44.716]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.
[02:23:45.136 --> 02:23:48.499]  Read all of the testimonials at ofthefield.com.
[02:23:48.699 --> 02:23:52.723]  You can order online for you and your loved ones, or call 1-888-51-EAT-FREE to share in the secret.
[02:24:01.596 --> 02:24:03.659]  By the way, just a broadcast note.
[02:24:03.739 --> 02:24:11.349]  Joining us Thursday, George Norrie is going to be on the broadcast, giving us his take on what's happening in the world economy and what's happening in Egypt.
[02:24:11.389 --> 02:24:15.955]  But I could not concur the piercing understanding of David Icke more on this issue.
[02:24:16.516 --> 02:24:17.577]  That's why I admire him so much.
[02:24:17.617 --> 02:24:23.445]  His research is always so up-to-date, and piercing is the word, and that's exactly what's happening.
[02:24:23.705 --> 02:24:35.159]  Instead of even black or white or grey, it's more of a prism of spectrums, and the globalists are riding this tiger of rebellion against their own tyranny, and like Judo, using the resistance
[02:24:35.920 --> 02:24:38.723]  of the population against them and throwing it back at them.
[02:24:39.124 --> 02:24:42.327]  And so by understanding this, though, we can defeat them.
[02:24:42.688 --> 02:24:48.794]  And I want to talk more about their predictive systems, future predicting systems, and how David thinks we counter that.
[02:24:48.834 --> 02:24:51.918]  But David, continuing, you got cut off by the break.
[02:24:51.938 --> 02:24:57.604]  You were running through the dictatorships that are in the Middle East, North Africa, and where this is going.
[02:24:57.964 --> 02:25:05.829]  Yeah, I mean we're talking about Yemen, Algeria, Libya, Jordan, Syria, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Kuwait.
[02:25:05.969 --> 02:25:12.493]  All these are so-called royal dictatorships and tyrannies imposing upon the people.
[02:25:12.753 --> 02:25:13.594]  So should they go?
[02:25:13.774 --> 02:25:14.815]  Absolutely they should go.
[02:25:15.075 --> 02:25:19.558]  But we're back to, and as soon as possible, but we're back to shades of grey.
[02:25:19.838 --> 02:25:22.440]  The question is not just should they go, it's
[02:25:23.680 --> 02:25:26.143]  What is the agenda for making them go at this time?
[02:25:26.643 --> 02:25:29.626]  And you know, there's a number of things that come from this.
[02:25:30.647 --> 02:25:43.718]  If they, as Kissinger has indicated here, they plan to create falling dominoes across the Middle East, first of all, that creates massive upheaval.
[02:25:43.738 --> 02:25:44.980]  It creates what?
[02:25:45.620 --> 02:25:45.860]  Chaos.
[02:25:46.861 --> 02:25:47.962]  What is their technique?
[02:25:48.502 --> 02:25:50.183]  Order out of chaos.
[02:25:50.524 --> 02:26:12.078]  Now, on one level, this could be very dangerous for places like Israel, but it could also be incredibly beneficial to those that run Israel, and very, very beneficial to those behind this global agenda, because they want the Middle Eastern countries in a state of subordination, and chaos will create that.
[02:26:12.138 --> 02:26:13.579]  The other thing is that
[02:26:14.731 --> 02:26:17.133]  Where does most of the world's oil come from?
[02:26:17.193 --> 02:26:18.314]  It comes from the Middle East.
[02:26:18.694 --> 02:26:27.920]  You start whacking domino upheavals across the Middle East and the oil countries, not least the big one, Saudi Arabia, and what are you going to have Alex?
[02:26:28.201 --> 02:26:29.862]  You're going to have an enormous
[02:26:30.282 --> 02:26:30.763]  We're good.
[02:26:45.915 --> 02:26:57.965]  It's clear to me that this genuine reaction to this disgraceful, outrageous evil attack on human society is being managed to bring about the next stage of the attack on human society.
[02:27:12.691 --> 02:27:31.286]  Expanding on that, we know in the last year the IMF and World Bank have ordered all of these third world countries, not just the Middle East, North Africa, to cut, through austerity, the bread ration, which around half the population of Egypt is on, making two dollars or less a day.
[02:27:31.806 --> 02:27:34.509]  And so they, economically through globalism,
[02:27:35.069 --> 02:27:44.338]  Pull the levers, punch the buttons, then they send in their man on a white horse, who the London Independent calls the saviour, this Alberti.
[02:27:45.139 --> 02:27:52.246]  So it's completely transparent to those that study this and know it, and the globalists are even admitting it, but on a larger front.
[02:27:52.907 --> 02:27:58.432]  The Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan, they just reshuffled the government towards them.
[02:27:58.932 --> 02:28:10.602]  In Saudi Arabia, everywhere the Saudis and others are freaking out realizing the deal they made with the globalists is a deal with the devil and they want the strategy of tension, the clash of civilizations.
[02:28:10.903 --> 02:28:15.487]  They want to get radical Muslims, like they got rid of Saddam and put radical Muslims in Iraq.
[02:28:16.067 --> 02:28:25.032]  This is the strategy to then build them up as the enemy and to blame them for the exploding oil prices that were already being triggered via dollar devaluation.
[02:28:25.672 --> 02:28:27.293]  Yeah, that's it.
[02:28:27.593 --> 02:28:36.738]  And the Muslim Brotherhood, you know, this is again, I keep coming back to this today, shades of grey becoming streetwise.
[02:28:37.419 --> 02:28:45.423]  And just because something has a name on the door and appears to stand for something does not mean that at its core it does.
[02:28:45.943 --> 02:28:57.931]  I mean, crikey, you look at the classic Orwellian use of names for organisations to give the impression that it's the opposite of what it really is.
[02:28:58.011 --> 02:28:59.632]  I mean, for goodness sake, we're talking here.
[02:29:00.476 --> 02:29:09.119]  About George Soros's Open Society Institute, which is the last thing the Open Society Institute actually wants.
[02:29:09.339 --> 02:29:27.404]  So when you look at things like Muslim Brotherhoods, and look at almost any organization that has democracy in it, and you're looking at an organization that wants to take democracy away, and just because it's called the Muslim Brotherhood does not mean that at its core it has even the best interests of Muslims at heart.
[02:29:27.784 --> 02:29:29.045]  You know, I was talking to
[02:29:30.845 --> 02:29:35.609]  People have been involved professionally in politics and intelligence and all the rest of it.
[02:29:35.889 --> 02:29:36.730]  David, stay there!
[02:29:37.270 --> 02:29:38.451]  Long segment coming up.
[02:29:38.491 --> 02:29:39.492]  That was a short segment.
[02:29:39.772 --> 02:29:42.134]  We'll continue there with the Muslim Brotherhood.
[02:29:42.154 --> 02:29:47.678]  And now we're in the first scene, in the first act of the play, what the full play is.
[02:29:49.219 --> 02:29:50.120]  We're on the march.
[02:29:50.621 --> 02:29:52.242]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.142 --> 02:29:55.845]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:58.895 --> 02:30:00.016]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:30:00.056 --> 02:30:06.723]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:30:07.003 --> 02:30:09.285]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:30:09.546 --> 02:30:14.751]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:30:14.931 --> 02:30:17.714]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:30:17.974 --> 02:30:20.036]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:30:20.276 --> 02:30:26.201]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:30:26.521 --> 02:30:29.724]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:30:29.904 --> 02:30:35.449]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:30:35.689 --> 02:30:37.010]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:30:37.331 --> 02:30:38.512]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:30:38.632 --> 02:30:41.174]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:30:41.314 --> 02:30:45.358]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:30:45.538 --> 02:30:47.239]  You can find the video at www.
[02:30:48.320 --> 02:30:50.002]  End of America 3.com.
[02:30:50.142 --> 02:30:52.585]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[02:30:52.725 --> 02:30:56.430]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:30:56.590 --> 02:30:57.591]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:30:58.886 --> 02:31:02.188]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[02:31:02.468 --> 02:31:03.529]  It ended on June of 2009.
[02:31:03.589 --> 02:31:07.951]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[02:31:08.152 --> 02:31:13.815]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[02:31:14.095 --> 02:31:16.076]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[02:31:16.256 --> 02:31:18.918]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[02:31:19.278 --> 02:31:25.581]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoodsDirect.
[02:31:25.782 --> 02:31:27.583]  They both make fabulous investments.
[02:31:27.983 --> 02:31:33.065]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[02:31:33.326 --> 02:31:38.328]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[02:31:38.608 --> 02:31:43.831]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[02:31:43.971 --> 02:31:46.913]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[02:31:47.153 --> 02:31:50.056]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[02:31:50.076 --> 02:31:50.936]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[02:31:59.514 --> 02:32:03.138]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:32:03.538 --> 02:32:06.541]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:32:06.761 --> 02:32:11.545]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:32:11.565 --> 02:32:17.811]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:32:17.971 --> 02:32:20.194]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:32:20.734 --> 02:32:21.014]  Tim Geithner?
[02:32:21.034 --> 02:32:21.454]  Bernanke?
[02:32:21.555 --> 02:32:22.155]  They're arsonists!
[02:32:22.215 --> 02:32:23.496]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:32:23.516 --> 02:32:25.757]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:32:39.645 --> 02:32:46.548]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:32:46.908 --> 02:32:56.031]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:33:04.206 --> 02:33:06.253]  Devastating globalist lies.
[02:33:06.835 --> 02:33:10.407]  Exposing the mainstream media's propaganda machine.
[02:33:11.172 --> 02:33:18.135]  Tirelessly waging war on corruption from deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6 in Austin, Texas.
[02:33:18.675 --> 02:33:22.276]  Transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:23.096 --> 02:33:27.198]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:28.378 --> 02:33:34.621]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:35.701 --> 02:33:43.906]  And you resist by unlocking your mind, studying how the globalist engineer society, the priest class, how they manipulate.
[02:33:43.987 --> 02:33:53.413]  By becoming aware of this in life, your family, in business, in everything, your knowledge and your success will only increase.
[02:33:54.133 --> 02:34:02.763]  The New World Order does everything they can to suppress human potential, the human mind, and knowledge, because the people perish for lack of knowledge.
[02:34:02.823 --> 02:34:07.409]  The people are destroyed for lack of knowledge, as the good book tells us.
[02:34:08.230 --> 02:34:08.730]  David Icke?
[02:34:09.967 --> 02:34:37.314]  As we went to break, you were starting to get into the first scene and the first act for the New World Order, the Global Destabilization Program, people rioting and protesting in Greece, in Ireland, at the Davos, Switzerland meeting last week, they called for 100 trillion in additional taxpayer money to the private banks, an open announcement of world government, all of that smoke-screened by what's happening now.
[02:34:37.394 --> 02:34:38.534]  David Icke, please continue.
[02:34:39.039 --> 02:34:48.486]  Yeah, I was just finishing off a point, Alex, about the fact that just because something's called something doesn't mean that's what it represents and that's what it stands for, including the Muslim Brotherhood.
[02:34:48.506 --> 02:34:55.291]  There's a lot of organizations in the Arab world that actually are fronts for Israel and the United States.
[02:34:56.292 --> 02:35:03.117]  Andreas von Bülow, I think you've talked to him yourself over the years, former German minister and an expert in intelligence.
[02:35:04.057 --> 02:35:06.539]  Especially German intelligence in that whole area.
[02:35:06.659 --> 02:35:07.600]  Andres von Bulow.
[02:35:07.700 --> 02:35:10.563]  Yeah, I talked to him on the phone for a long time, years ago.
[02:35:11.804 --> 02:35:20.731]  Not long after 9-11, and he was saying he knew for a fact that Abu Nadal, of course the infamous Arab terrorist, was actually an asset of Mossad.
[02:35:20.771 --> 02:35:21.471]  That's how it works.
[02:35:21.511 --> 02:35:27.856]  Yeah, he was the former head of German intelligence and the former German defense minister.
[02:35:27.917 --> 02:35:29.438]  He talked about the white supremacist.
[02:35:29.898 --> 02:35:33.719]  Yeah, and of course we know the classic stands out like the proverbial.
[02:35:46.543 --> 02:35:47.784]  I don't think so.
[02:36:08.933 --> 02:36:11.974]  The classic line, really, by their actions shall they be judged.
[02:36:12.014 --> 02:36:15.396]  That's what we need to do, not by what they say, but what they do.
[02:36:15.776 --> 02:36:28.722]  Another interesting thing, Alex, you know, is that there is this whole deal about what's known as Greater Israel, which is the area that the Israel extremists claim is theirs, the real Israel.
[02:36:28.782 --> 02:36:35.525]  And it's interesting when you look at the map of it, it includes, of course, Israel-Palestine that we see now, but it also includes
[02:36:36.206 --> 02:36:46.182]  A great chunk of Egypt going across to Cairo includes Jordan, includes Lebanon, includes Syria, includes Iraq, includes a great chunk of Saudi Arabia.
[02:36:46.522 --> 02:36:47.884]  Now, what we're looking at here...
[02:36:48.738 --> 02:37:00.123]  As you look at that map, all the countries, or many of the countries, that are actually now in possible line for this domino effect that Kissinger was indicating with his quote.
[02:37:01.184 --> 02:37:03.265]  And there is an agenda playing out here.
[02:37:03.405 --> 02:37:11.628]  And when we look at what's happening in Europe, what's happening in Britain, beginning to, what's happening in America, my goodness me, we want more.
[02:37:12.149 --> 02:37:14.710]  Not just people on the streets to show the numbers,
[02:37:15.510 --> 02:37:20.799]  But also non-cooperation with the system, so the system cannot operate.
[02:37:21.319 --> 02:37:22.882]  What works if it needs us to do that?
[02:37:23.262 --> 02:37:27.709]  We must be learning lessons here, Alex, all the time.
[02:37:28.931 --> 02:37:29.733]  For instance, the power...
[02:37:30.991 --> 02:37:31.472]  Of course.
[02:37:50.932 --> 02:38:00.258]  Revolution unfolds against a regime, one of the first things to go is not only truth, but actually the internet and mobile phone networks so people can't communicate.
[02:38:01.199 --> 02:38:05.802]  And another thing we need to keep in our minds is no ideology.
[02:38:06.242 --> 02:38:10.805]  When we really trigger this true human revolution,
[02:38:11.665 --> 02:38:18.330]  Against these tyrannies, or collective tyrannies, different faces or masks on the same face around the world.
[02:38:18.790 --> 02:38:19.810]  No ideology.
[02:38:20.151 --> 02:38:24.854]  Equal freedom for everybody, no matter what their colour, creed, religion, view, anything.
[02:38:24.874 --> 02:38:30.097]  Freedom must be our focus, not ideology and religious belief and all that stuff.
[02:38:30.137 --> 02:38:32.519]  We can argue about that or chat and debate about that.
[02:38:32.919 --> 02:38:38.082]  Let's keep our focus on what affects us all, and that's our basic freedoms being taken away.
[02:38:39.804 --> 02:38:43.207]  So many people, they talk about wanting freedom, Alex, but they don't want freedom.
[02:38:43.548 --> 02:38:47.812]  To a large extent, they want to replace the tyranny they don't like with a tyranny they do, i.e.
[02:38:48.513 --> 02:38:49.454]  their belief system.
[02:38:49.514 --> 02:38:57.123]  These are the things that have to go, and we all must constantly keep our focus on who is
[02:38:59.074 --> 02:39:01.715]  What is the motivation of the protest and the uprising?
[02:39:02.256 --> 02:39:06.677]  Who's going to be and what kind of society is going to be in power when it's over?
[02:39:07.037 --> 02:39:08.418]  Who are these people coming in?
[02:39:08.438 --> 02:39:12.600]  Claiming to be on our side and claiming to be behind it.
[02:39:13.120 --> 02:39:18.682]  We need to really get streetwise and learn from what's happening around the world so we don't get caught.
[02:39:19.568 --> 02:39:20.408]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:39:20.448 --> 02:39:23.529]  Now, we know that Mohamed ElBaradei is a big U.N.
[02:39:23.549 --> 02:39:27.691]  globalist, former head of the Atomic Energy Agency, U.S.-trained.
[02:39:28.451 --> 02:39:31.032]  We know that he is for the inoculations.
[02:39:31.092 --> 02:39:33.453]  He is for the Planned Parenthood type stuff.
[02:39:33.813 --> 02:39:34.693]  He is a globalist.
[02:39:34.734 --> 02:39:41.856]  We know the Muslim Brotherhood, admittedly set up by British intelligence, is now menacing Saudi Arabia and others who we're not fans of.
[02:39:41.876 --> 02:39:43.917]  But the point is, the globalists want
[02:39:44.417 --> 02:39:53.305]  to have more radical regimes come in so that then Israel and others have an excuse to expand their land in the name of a security buffer zone.
[02:39:53.685 --> 02:40:00.632]  They're now moving out of the era of strongmen and moving towards the strategy of tension.
[02:40:00.892 --> 02:40:04.816]  What do you, from your research, see as the next dominoes to fall?
[02:40:05.549 --> 02:40:07.411]  Well, any of them could be, really.
[02:40:08.352 --> 02:40:12.476]  The answer to that is who's next on the list, because it could be any of them.
[02:40:12.897 --> 02:40:26.051]  But the thing also about Israel, Alex, is if this uprising, so-called crisis as it's being portrayed, a crisis for tyranny on one level,
[02:40:26.591 --> 02:40:28.593]  We're good.
[02:40:46.192 --> 02:40:47.253]  We're good to go.
[02:41:07.806 --> 02:41:10.669]  Um, things, Alex, and this is, I think, very relevant.
[02:41:10.729 --> 02:41:27.726]  Not necessarily what will happen tomorrow, but in this domino falling situation that we're now facing, one of the things that's come up again and again and again and again is that the third world war, the third global conflict, the one that is to create
[02:41:28.707 --> 02:41:32.009]  Along with all the other things we're seeing, like finances and all the rest of it.
[02:41:32.089 --> 02:41:34.051]  And that's what Albert Pike called for.
[02:41:34.091 --> 02:41:36.593]  Albert Pike, yeah, in his letter, exactly, the three world wars.
[02:41:38.374 --> 02:41:42.957]  And again, this also relates to what he said in terms of the third world war.
[02:41:43.297 --> 02:41:51.763]  The common theme is that that will be triggered in some way out of Israel and the Arab countries.
[02:41:52.143 --> 02:42:00.089]  And by the way, in 1878 he laid out World War I, who it would be between, World War II, and then finally World War III.
[02:42:00.129 --> 02:42:06.173]  They would then destroy all world religions out of the war and say we must have this new global one world government religion.
[02:42:06.193 --> 02:42:17.460]  I want you to get to that, but since you've mentioned it so much, and I've mentioned it, here's Henry Kissinger on Bloomberg saying this is only the first scene, the first act of a drama that is to be played out.
[02:42:17.700 --> 02:42:21.763]  Here is Henry Kissinger, top globalist strategist, openly bragging.
[02:42:21.983 --> 02:42:26.847]  Certainly, and of a lot of maneuvering once the lid is off.
[02:42:27.988 --> 02:42:30.850]  Right now everybody's focused on the removal of Mubarak.
[02:42:31.510 --> 02:42:37.995]  That is only the first scene of the first act of a drama that has to be played out.
[02:42:39.396 --> 02:42:43.179]  And this act you've seen lasting for several months, years perhaps?
[02:42:44.059 --> 02:42:47.302]  And it will, it might, it depends now.
[02:42:48.841 --> 02:42:55.844]  I think we should stay out of that dispute because we don't want to look as if we are imposing a government.
[02:42:56.784 --> 02:43:00.806]  But we shouldn't be so mesmerized by the short-term tactics.
[02:43:01.690 --> 02:43:05.315]  The real problem will be what is the ultimate orientation of Egypt.
[02:43:06.116 --> 02:43:09.740]  Because it is, in many respects, the key to the region.
[02:43:19.372 --> 02:43:23.335]  Yeah, they've got a song sheet, and this is not projected days in advance, weeks, months, or even years in advance.
[02:43:23.355 --> 02:43:24.876]  It's projected decades in advance.
[02:43:49.227 --> 02:43:50.928]  Yeah, Brzezinski says 25 years in advance.
[02:43:51.028 --> 02:43:53.930]  Yeah, and maybe more.
[02:43:53.970 --> 02:44:02.736]  I mean, you know, the basic theme of what's happening was outlined before the turn of the 20th century in terms of the themes of it all.
[02:44:03.216 --> 02:44:13.723]  And you know, I've quoted people in my books who've spoken over the years, like in the late 60s and stuff like that, insiders who said this is how the world's going to be.
[02:44:13.783 --> 02:44:17.105]  And it's all unfolded, as they said it would unfold, because it is a blueprint.
[02:44:17.545 --> 02:44:18.446]  And now we're seeing
[02:44:19.426 --> 02:44:32.332]  A real major, major card being played here, which is designed to trigger offshoot consequences in all directions, because this is the tinderbox.
[02:44:32.412 --> 02:44:38.575]  This is the explosive point where they want to the next whole stage to explode out of.
[02:44:38.735 --> 02:44:39.315]  Well, you heard him.
[02:44:40.055 --> 02:44:50.739]  He said it's the key, and then by running destabilization ops and all the other countries that aren't just allies of the globalists, they can create the crisis to offer the military and economic solution.
[02:44:50.759 --> 02:44:54.080]  But David, how frustrating is it for you and for myself?
[02:44:54.100 --> 02:44:55.040]  And I want to get your view on this.
[02:44:55.700 --> 02:45:18.571]  To have the blueprint, to have the CFR, Trilateral Commission, Bilderberg Group, much of what they do public, admitting they would create a global currency crisis, they would end the dollar, bring in the band car, SDR, you know, a hundred trillion, all now happening, but the yuppies have been put in their little comfort box and conditioned that none of this existed for decades, knowing that we have the documents.
[02:45:18.631 --> 02:45:20.412]  They preconditioned it didn't exist.
[02:45:21.212 --> 02:45:30.748]  So now that it even exists and has emerged, people have gone, some of them, into a catatonic state of denying it exists even as it's announced.
[02:45:31.907 --> 02:45:46.018]  Well, this is a major human trait in the programmed, manipulated human mind, which simply does not want to face what it doesn't want to believe is true.
[02:45:46.879 --> 02:45:51.002]  So, when you are faced with something, you have a choice.
[02:45:51.502 --> 02:46:00.189]  You can literally face it and deal with it, and we could sort this if we did this in large enough numbers, or you can try to kid yourself
[02:46:01.309 --> 02:46:05.090]  That it doesn't exist, and therefore it's okay.
[02:46:05.110 --> 02:46:17.273]  You know, people say in situations where it's obvious that horrific things are going to be done in the very near future, and they're still saying, oh no, they'd never do that.
[02:46:17.633 --> 02:46:24.214]  No, you want to persuade yourself they'd never do that, so you don't have to get your backside unglued from the sofa.
[02:46:24.634 --> 02:46:26.856]  And do things you'd rather not have to do.
[02:46:26.936 --> 02:46:34.322]  And this is why we're at this point, Alex, and it's like, how much more confirmation do people want?
[02:46:34.702 --> 02:46:37.504]  How much more blatant does it have to be?
[02:46:37.765 --> 02:46:39.706]  Does it have to be the knock on the door?
[02:46:39.746 --> 02:46:43.389]  Does it have to be being taken away after the knock on the door?
[02:46:43.569 --> 02:46:46.411]  I mean, when are you going to draw a line here?
[02:46:46.792 --> 02:46:50.975]  But you know, on another level, there's great encouraging
[02:46:51.015 --> 02:46:51.075]  Yes.
[02:46:51.095 --> 02:46:52.015]  Well, two things are happening, David.
[02:47:20.465 --> 02:47:21.046]  We're good to go.
[02:47:40.954 --> 02:47:41.054]  Yes.
[02:47:41.074 --> 02:47:41.775]  Yes, the print.
[02:48:00.186 --> 02:48:22.672]  We're protesting about all roads lead to the same cabal and it's the cabal we must focus on and the global agenda for the cabal so that we challenge and expose and understand the picture rather than getting caught in just the pieces so we see the forest instead of getting caught in the twigs.
[02:48:22.712 --> 02:48:23.992]  This is so important.
[02:48:24.403 --> 02:48:32.387]  No, no, I totally agree with you because the progenitor of all of this debt slavery, of this neo-feudalistic system, is the New World Order controllers.
[02:48:32.827 --> 02:48:34.548]  It is their social engineering model.
[02:48:34.848 --> 02:48:37.589]  And for the New World Order, global government is just the beginning.
[02:48:38.630 --> 02:48:44.933]  As we say in the film Endgame, their stated plan is a global police state to then carry out the forced
[02:48:45.333 --> 02:48:50.016]  Sterilization of the entire population except for a tiny group of globalists.
[02:48:50.316 --> 02:48:52.978]  This is full spectrum dominance.
[02:48:53.539 --> 02:49:07.848]  And if people just get angry at the atmosphere created by the engineers, their anger, their focus will be used and shunted and directed into empowering New World Order agendas instead of bringing it down.
[02:49:07.908 --> 02:49:11.511]  That's why what you just said is the absolute paramount
[02:49:12.931 --> 02:49:18.613]  Yeah, who benefits?
[02:49:18.673 --> 02:49:19.473]  Who benefits?
[02:49:19.513 --> 02:49:20.273]  Who benefits?
[02:49:20.513 --> 02:49:22.074]  We gotta keep asking that.
[02:49:22.374 --> 02:49:24.234]  Who benefits from this situation?
[02:49:24.514 --> 02:49:27.895]  Who benefits from me reacting to this situation like this?
[02:49:28.635 --> 02:49:34.777]  And this is why I say we have to get ourselves informed, not just about
[02:49:35.437 --> 02:49:36.618]  We're good to go.
[02:49:53.707 --> 02:49:56.029]  It's like getting your sight!
[02:49:56.049 --> 02:49:56.469]  God.
[02:50:11.187 --> 02:50:11.607]  Exactly.
[02:50:11.627 --> 02:50:15.269]  When you're not aware of these systems of control, it's like you're blind and deaf.
[02:50:15.609 --> 02:50:20.651]  As soon as you understand their tricks, it isn't as powerful anymore, and it actually becomes irritating.
[02:50:20.972 --> 02:50:28.795]  Not something that puts you into a trance, but something their attacks actually help us learn to be smarter, faster, to understand it.
[02:50:28.995 --> 02:50:31.997]  But going to break here, here's the Associated Press.
[02:50:32.497 --> 02:50:36.899]  The IMF says, or AFP, IMF says to help Egypt
[02:50:37.339 --> 02:50:38.080]  Others in trouble.
[02:50:38.160 --> 02:50:42.563]  Oh, they're going to help them with more 20-30% interest rate loans.
[02:50:42.803 --> 02:50:44.985]  They're going to bring the Egyptians more under debt.
[02:50:45.225 --> 02:50:47.567]  They're going to jack up their taxes even more.
[02:50:47.647 --> 02:50:52.791]  So there is part of your agenda with the physical takeover through the economic bondage.
[02:50:53.071 --> 02:50:55.032]  We got two more segments with David Icke coming up.
[02:50:55.212 --> 02:50:56.473]  Powerful information.
[02:50:56.734 --> 02:50:57.454]  DavidIcke.com.
[02:50:59.526 --> 02:51:02.068]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:51:02.088 --> 02:51:09.935]  Did you know that the prophet Jeremiah was told not to pray for the house of Judah anymore because of their personal and national sins?
[02:51:10.796 --> 02:51:16.841]  Could it be that God has ceased hearing prayers for America because of our personal and national sins also?
[02:51:17.682 --> 02:51:29.913]  Pornography, adultery, fornication, homosexuality, lesbianism, corporate theft, lust and greed are running rampant all over America, which was once declared a Christian nation.
[02:51:31.134 --> 02:51:32.155]  When will it all end?
[02:51:32.875 --> 02:51:34.637]  In slavery to the New World Order?
[02:51:35.694 --> 02:51:44.081]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:51:44.921 --> 02:51:46.402]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-516-8736.
[02:51:46.422 --> 02:51:46.623]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:52:00.194 --> 02:52:03.796]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:04.216 --> 02:52:07.218]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:07.458 --> 02:52:12.240]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:12.260 --> 02:52:18.464]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:18.644 --> 02:52:20.885]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:52:21.425 --> 02:52:22.847]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:22.907 --> 02:52:24.048]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:24.068 --> 02:52:26.430]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:40.325 --> 02:52:42.167]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:42.448 --> 02:52:47.274]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:52:47.614 --> 02:52:56.965]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:52:58.527 --> 02:53:00.667]  Going solar for cheap is as easy as 123.
[02:53:01.428 --> 02:53:06.688]  If you want to go solar but thought the setup costs were too high, now you can build your own solar panels for less than $200.
[02:53:07.549 --> 02:53:08.169]  Don't laugh!
[02:53:08.309 --> 02:53:11.049]  We've sold over 45,000 solar do-it-yourself kits.
[02:53:11.269 --> 02:53:15.810]  Watch our introduction video at 123cheapsolarvideo.com.
[02:53:15.910 --> 02:53:17.850]  The video is free, but it won't last long.
[02:53:18.030 --> 02:53:20.331]  Save money on electric bills and get off the grid!
[02:53:20.451 --> 02:53:23.491]  Go to 123cheapsolarvideo.com right now!
[02:53:23.711 --> 02:53:25.412]  Our website again is 123cheapsolarvideo.com.
[02:53:28.072 --> 02:53:29.133]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:53:29.313 --> 02:53:33.696]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:53:33.876 --> 02:53:39.580]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:53:39.680 --> 02:53:43.102]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:53:43.322 --> 02:53:45.924]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:53:46.044 --> 02:53:50.947]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:53:51.107 --> 02:53:51.328]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:53:51.348 --> 02:53:52.749]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:54:07.114 --> 02:54:08.834]  Knowledge is power.
[02:54:09.974 --> 02:54:13.995]  And any of you listeners understand the world greater than David or myself do.
[02:54:14.075 --> 02:54:17.835]  All of us have different gifts, different talents and understanding.
[02:54:18.475 --> 02:54:21.816]  But the biggest mission is people are confused, they're angry right now.
[02:54:21.856 --> 02:54:27.137]  We can't have the globalists, as Ron Paul has said, misdirect them into supporting a bigger New World Order move.
[02:54:28.137 --> 02:54:45.110]  That's why we carry films like What in the World Are They Spraying, dealing with Kim Trails, my film Endgame that covers their master agenda, Invisible Empire that we produced by Jason Bermas is excellent, Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror, all these films massively discounted at InfoWars.com.
[02:54:45.150 --> 02:54:47.912]  And David's books and his work, all of it is so important.
[02:54:47.932 --> 02:54:49.813]  But David, we've got you into the next segment.
[02:54:49.833 --> 02:54:50.814]  You're gracious to join us.
[02:54:52.615 --> 02:54:59.401]  I wanted to do something here that the producers showed me earlier, and that's Tweet Psych.
[02:55:00.081 --> 02:55:06.307]  That's the website, and if you type in somebody's tweet account, they're monitoring the tweets.
[02:55:06.327 --> 02:55:12.352]  The Library of Congress is saving all of them, and they know the psychological profile of your users.
[02:55:12.812 --> 02:55:19.077]  You type in the real Alex Jones for tweet, and you scroll down, and most of it is media, social,
[02:55:20.959 --> 02:55:25.870]  You know, future, people want to know, you know, future trends, learning, positive.
[02:55:27.048 --> 02:55:30.790]  Conceptual, basically, philosophy.
[02:55:31.050 --> 02:55:31.770]  The census.
[02:55:32.090 --> 02:55:33.871]  See, it's all about primordial.
[02:55:34.591 --> 02:55:35.632]  That's what people are into.
[02:55:35.812 --> 02:55:37.992]  They're into primordial, the core of humanity.
[02:55:38.293 --> 02:55:40.153]  Destiny, enlightenment, awakening.
[02:55:40.494 --> 02:55:42.154]  That's who comes to my tweet.
[02:55:42.234 --> 02:55:43.635]  And they're tracking them and know who they are.
[02:55:43.875 --> 02:55:49.857]  And it's much more detailed with the cable boxes tracking you, the Google tracking you right down to your individual profile.
[02:55:50.318 --> 02:55:53.959]  Now, you go to something like Two and a Half Men or Joe Rogan.
[02:55:54.939 --> 02:55:55.740]  These are nice guys.
[02:55:56.460 --> 02:55:56.700]  It's sex!
[02:56:17.541 --> 02:56:19.683]  Uh, it will, uh, you know, show you what they're into.
[02:56:19.723 --> 02:56:23.245]  This is just one example of how they've gotten us tied into this.
[02:56:23.265 --> 02:56:24.526]  The Internet is a double-edged sword.
[02:56:24.926 --> 02:56:27.208]  They thought they would use it as a worldwide wiretap.
[02:56:27.688 --> 02:56:28.288]  DARPA did.
[02:56:28.328 --> 02:56:29.809]  Instead, we're using it against them.
[02:56:29.829 --> 02:56:35.613]  But we have to understand, they're now bragging that they can predict mass movements almost 100% of the time.
[02:56:36.214 --> 02:56:41.237]  How do you deal with something like that, with these super technologies the globalists have?
[02:56:41.597 --> 02:56:42.038]  David Icke.
[02:56:43.339 --> 02:56:54.463]  The thing about the Internet is that it's given us so many tools to communicate information that these people overwhelmingly do not want communicated.
[02:56:55.263 --> 02:57:02.165]  Without the Internet, people would not, at this point, be anything like as informed about what's going on as they are.
[02:57:02.426 --> 02:57:08.248]  Therefore, given that the Internet was introduced through military technology, etc.
[02:57:09.428 --> 02:57:29.091]  For that to be given to the people, if you like, to use for the benefit of awakening and awareness, there must be something absolutely colossal and fundamental in it for them, on the other side, for that to have been done.
[02:57:29.831 --> 02:57:36.877]  And, you know, I think what we need to do is start to look about the reality from an internet point of view.
[02:57:36.897 --> 02:57:45.103]  The internet is actually a collective human mind, or an extension of it.
[02:57:45.163 --> 02:57:49.306]  We put our thoughts, our dreams, our art, everything in one area.
[02:57:51.127 --> 02:58:19.883]  Yeah, anything that you focus on with mind becomes an extension of mind, and therefore the collective human mind has an extension now called the World Wide Web, the Internet, and therefore if you are skilled in understanding how to read this information, and goodness knows the advancement of the computer technology they must have,
[02:58:20.223 --> 02:58:23.846]  We can organically do what their supercomputers can do individually.
[02:58:24.046 --> 02:58:27.509]  They're trying to mimic the human mind by scanning the web.
[02:58:27.529 --> 02:58:34.995]  What you can do is read the human mind by what the human mind is putting onto the web.
[02:58:35.815 --> 02:58:37.457]  Yes, stay there, stay there, stay there.
[02:58:37.597 --> 02:58:37.957]  Powerful.
[02:58:40.419 --> 02:58:42.701]  Powerful.
[02:58:42.741 --> 02:58:46.484]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

[02:59:47.311 --> 02:59:47.752]  Thank you.
[02:59:49.773 --> 02:59:50.954]  Coast to Coast.
[02:59:51.314 --> 02:59:52.775]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:53.376 --> 02:59:56.578]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:03.945 --> 03:00:06.907]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[03:00:07.487 --> 03:00:11.690]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:12.030 --> 03:00:16.774]  We're going to continue rolling deeper into the hour with David.
[03:00:17.354 --> 03:00:23.778]  And I got a bunch of callers on hold, but I want to go through them and ask who wants to talk to David specifically or address a question on these general topics.
[03:00:23.798 --> 03:00:27.761]  I know they've been holding, but I want to keep it focused on what we're getting into here.
[03:00:27.801 --> 03:00:30.123]  But the field is wide when we're talking to David Icke.
[03:00:31.003 --> 03:00:35.125]  I'm Alex Jones of Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:00:35.385 --> 03:00:43.388]  There is a huge awakening and we're going to come back and get more into the police state grid, the physical control grid, and take some phone calls in the next long segment.
[03:00:44.008 --> 03:00:49.150]  But David, it's so powerful what we were just talking about in the last segment.
[03:00:49.471 --> 03:00:50.171]  Quantify it.
[03:00:51.131 --> 03:00:57.197]  For those that may not understand, the web is almost like a mirror of what people are really thinking.
[03:00:57.798 --> 03:01:05.665]  So the globalists can see our soul, they can see who we really are, just like a thousand-question psychological test can show you something.
[03:01:05.705 --> 03:01:12.552]  Well, these are millions of choices we individually make watching digital TV that tracks us on Twitter, Facebook, Google.
[03:01:14.212 --> 03:01:19.095]  They admit they can now, quote, predict mass movement futures, 93% of the time, individuals.
[03:01:19.495 --> 03:01:21.336]  That's what they're telling us they have, but you're right.
[03:01:22.017 --> 03:01:29.301]  I, using the web and seeing things, I can simply go to Shoutcast and tell what people are more interested in, watching the numbers go up.
[03:01:29.541 --> 03:01:33.323]  They're simple things like that, but it's much deeper, and the globalists know.
[03:01:33.764 --> 03:01:40.908]  That's why I've got Rolling Stone, New York Magazine, Newsweek, all these people calling me, because they're saying, we see your numbers.
[03:01:41.408 --> 03:01:46.234]  My radio show, InfoWars.com, bigger than MSNBC, a tiny operation.
[03:01:46.554 --> 03:01:50.298]  They see what all of us are doing is huge and powerful.
[03:01:50.358 --> 03:01:53.362]  They know the awakening's there, and they don't know how to deal with it.
[03:01:53.402 --> 03:01:56.005]  That's why Obama's calling for the internet kill switch.
[03:01:56.025 --> 03:02:00.891]  That's why worldwide, Australia, England, they are actually scared, David Icke.
[03:02:01.670 --> 03:02:25.834]  Well, when anyone in the public arena, a scientist or whatever, comes out and says, we're working on this technology which years from now could do this, say in terms of computers, they're talking about building quantum computers, the advancement and potential for which to process information is just
[03:02:26.494 --> 03:02:27.055]  Staggering.
[03:02:27.095 --> 03:02:29.859]  It makes the best computers today look like the village idiot.
[03:02:30.300 --> 03:02:31.601]  When they're saying it's coming...
[03:02:32.572 --> 03:02:44.454]  They might genuinely, genuinely be telling the truth from their point of view, because they're not aware of what's going on outside of their sphere of knowledge in the secret projects, etc.
[03:02:44.915 --> 03:02:50.116]  But things like quantum computers that we're going to have in the future, these guys have got them now!
[03:02:50.576 --> 03:03:01.958]  I mean, if we could see the computing technology, information processing technology that they have, we would be staggered at how far ahead of the public arena it is.
[03:03:02.738 --> 03:03:07.361]  And what we're doing all the time with the internet, and it's important we use it.
[03:03:07.581 --> 03:03:08.561]  Massively important.
[03:03:08.681 --> 03:03:11.423]  We have to use these things to our advantage.
[03:03:12.384 --> 03:03:12.644]  I don't
[03:03:37.233 --> 03:03:52.180]  No, 10 years ago the Pentagon admitted they have a map of 3D of the entire world already and they admit with smart dust and all these meters and tracking they're making the real world searchable like Google.
[03:03:53.015 --> 03:04:07.798]  Yeah, I mean, the technology they're dealing with is fantastic, but, you know, we must keep coming back to this, I suggest, and that is for all their technology and for all their know-how, for all the knowledge they have that they keep from the people in general,
[03:04:08.218 --> 03:04:09.178]  We have the numbers.
[03:04:09.278 --> 03:04:13.980]  We have billions compared with a relative handful at the core of this that are behind it all.
[03:04:14.840 --> 03:04:30.466]  And the idea is to keep us in a constant state of divide and rule, fear, and confusion and chaos and bewilderment, so that we do not unite and meet this together.
[03:04:30.826 --> 03:04:35.648]  Because one of the things that does come out of these people's revolutions
[03:04:36.688 --> 03:04:38.910]  Although, of course, sometimes the military are called off.
[03:04:39.031 --> 03:04:41.613]  But even then, the military can only go so far.
[03:04:41.973 --> 03:04:46.918]  And that is the power of vast numbers of people saying, enough.
[03:04:46.958 --> 03:04:52.803]  There comes a point where the numbers are so great that there's nothing the system can do about it.
[03:04:52.943 --> 03:04:54.885]  And we must keep that in our minds.
[03:04:54.985 --> 03:04:55.165]  Yes.
[03:04:55.506 --> 03:04:57.928]  We'll be right back.
[03:05:00.151 --> 03:05:02.174]  Where have all the Military Surplus stores gone?
[03:05:02.354 --> 03:05:04.076]  Don't worry, you don't need one.

[03:05:48.868 --> 03:05:49.328]  MainMilitary.com.
[03:05:49.348 --> 03:05:50.349]  The main name in military supply.
[03:05:58.692 --> 03:06:01.013]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[03:06:01.073 --> 03:06:03.314]  We are part of a New World Order.
[03:06:03.394 --> 03:06:06.196]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[03:06:06.616 --> 03:06:11.339]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:06:11.719 --> 03:06:15.901]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:06:16.221 --> 03:06:18.562]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:06:18.682 --> 03:06:21.103]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:06:21.443 --> 03:06:24.024]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:06:24.365 --> 03:06:31.968]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:06:32.307 --> 03:06:37.549]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:06:37.689 --> 03:06:39.970]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:06:40.010 --> 03:06:43.971]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:06:44.231 --> 03:06:45.132]  And I got news for you.
[03:06:45.292 --> 03:06:46.612]  You're everyone else.
[03:06:46.632 --> 03:06:47.753]  Invisible Empire.

[03:07:53.556 --> 03:08:00.039]  I love them, and then got a little bit of it down in my lung.
[03:08:00.099 --> 03:08:01.639]  Boy, I tell you, that'll wake you up.
[03:08:20.831 --> 03:08:22.272]  By drinking five cups of coffee.
[03:08:23.033 --> 03:08:24.334]  It's our final segment with David.
[03:08:24.354 --> 03:08:40.148]  I do want to get to a few phone calls with him, but if you just joined us, David Icke, author, researcher, was getting into the awakening and one of my biggest frustrations, but at the same time it's exciting because I know how close we are to shifting, you know, the tide against tyranny.
[03:08:40.168 --> 03:08:46.414]  I believe it's already changed, but the momentum is now accelerating towards awakening and resistance.
[03:08:48.032 --> 03:08:54.917]  To the globalist system that is so horrible, that is so destructive towards humanity.
[03:08:55.277 --> 03:09:16.973]  And David, you talked a lot about compartmentalization, how when you were covering Bilderberg Group, and there down at the bottom of the hill was police officers who had children, who were nice guys, you talked to them, and here they were guarding these world leaders who were destroying their future, putting poisons in their water and vaccines, openly writing books about how they're doing it.
[03:09:17.814 --> 03:09:24.438]  But it's so horrific that that cop either can't or won't look at the evidence because they feel like they're part of the power structure.
[03:09:24.458 --> 03:09:33.985]  But as soon as we can explain to the military, to bureaucrats, to the police, to ourselves, you know, if you want to look at who caused the problem, folks, look in the mirror.
[03:09:34.285 --> 03:09:38.127]  It's our inaction or our buying into their propaganda that has allowed this.
[03:09:38.187 --> 03:09:41.269]  But we are under attack by these globalists.
[03:09:41.290 --> 03:09:43.891]  99.9% of us, 99.9% of us have a stake in defeating
[03:09:46.873 --> 03:09:47.634]  Yes, because the
[03:10:09.182 --> 03:10:24.352]  The numbers at the core of this are so small compared with the global population that to control the global population the inner core has to recruit from the target population to keep the target population in line.
[03:10:24.692 --> 03:10:34.379]  It has to fill its uniforms and its dark suit administrators positions with the target population and through compartmentalization
[03:10:34.939 --> 03:10:35.320]  We're good.
[03:10:51.442 --> 03:11:00.087]  Day after day after day, all their lives, helping to build a prison for themselves and for their children, grandchildren and families.
[03:11:00.147 --> 03:11:04.170]  And that situation in Switzerland, it was just a classic.
[03:11:04.310 --> 03:11:14.216]  I was staying with some people in southern Switzerland near the Italian border and a round robin came round saying the Bilderberg Group meeting this year is at so-and-so.
[03:11:14.596 --> 03:11:18.679]  And it was on top of a mountain about two hours drive north into Switzerland.
[03:11:19.319 --> 03:11:27.170]  And I went the day before, two days before, and I saw the people going round and it was about three very flash hotels.
[03:11:28.795 --> 03:11:37.460]  At the Palace and the Grand, a couple of them were called, and they were putting the fences up and all the people in the jackets arranging everything.
[03:11:37.940 --> 03:11:40.601]  And then I went back on the last day.
[03:11:41.081 --> 03:11:50.966]  Now, instead of going up to the hotels, I was stopped literally a few minutes after I turned off the main highway, right at the bottom of the mountain.
[03:11:50.987 --> 03:11:55.349]  I wasn't even allowed near it, and there was this Swiss policeman in orange jacket.
[03:11:56.029 --> 03:11:57.290]  I asked him what was going on.
[03:11:58.266 --> 03:11:59.747]  And they generally didn't know.
[03:11:59.767 --> 03:12:01.949]  They said, well, there's an important meeting going on.
[03:12:01.989 --> 03:12:02.890]  We don't know anything about it.
[03:12:02.910 --> 03:12:07.093]  We've just been told that no one can go up through this road any further than here.
[03:12:07.113 --> 03:12:11.077]  And they said, oh, I think it's ending this afternoon and you'll be able to go up tomorrow or something.
[03:12:11.737 --> 03:12:16.441]  And these people were, in effect, guarding people they had no idea about.
[03:12:16.741 --> 03:12:18.823]  They had no idea what their agenda was.
[03:12:18.883 --> 03:12:20.404]  Horrendous for their own families.
[03:12:20.825 --> 03:12:22.166]  And this is how it works.
[03:12:22.866 --> 03:12:25.989]  We come back again, Alex, to what I was talking about earlier.
[03:12:26.349 --> 03:12:36.397]  It's not just those protesting about various injustices that need to get informed about how the whole thing works and how it's all connected.
[03:12:36.757 --> 03:12:48.086]  So do the people in dark suits and uniforms have to understand that they are cogs in a machine which is there to entrap their children and grandchildren.
[03:12:48.146 --> 03:12:52.129]  Indeed, in the timescale we're looking at, if we allow it to happen even themselves, in a
[03:12:53.521 --> 03:12:59.626]  An Orwellian global tyranny that would make, you know, George Orwell kind of wins.
[03:12:59.746 --> 03:13:09.553]  And not only that, just look at Nazi Germany, or communist Russia, Soviet Union, and then add some, and then some, and that's what you're looking at.
[03:13:09.593 --> 03:13:13.816]  Look at China, one of the blueprints for the global society tyranny they want.
[03:13:13.876 --> 03:13:14.696]  Look at that.
[03:13:14.837 --> 03:13:16.238]  Then look your children in the eye.
[03:13:16.298 --> 03:13:19.620]  Look yourself in the eye and say, what am I doing?
[03:13:19.740 --> 03:13:20.401]  Absolutely.
[03:13:21.441 --> 03:13:27.487]  People need to get conscious and make decisions and get out of denial because it's all out in the open now.
[03:13:27.847 --> 03:13:37.095]  They just got people to commit to denial and so people don't want to feel like they were conned and so people are now buying into torture, secret arrest, checkpoints and...
[03:13:37.896 --> 03:13:41.059]  One of the other big mind control systems is role-playing.
[03:13:41.539 --> 03:13:46.544]  Oh, it's just civil libertarians that don't like illegal checkpoints or warrantless blood draws.
[03:13:47.064 --> 03:13:49.987]  Oh, it's just activists that don't like these wars.
[03:13:50.147 --> 03:13:52.329]  Oh, it's just... Well, I'm not an activist.
[03:13:52.369 --> 03:13:52.950]  Well, I'm not a...
[03:13:53.988 --> 03:14:00.051]  People need to see themselves in the role of getting informed, and then as they grow, informing others.
[03:14:00.111 --> 03:14:02.272]  Because this is a life-and-death situation.
[03:14:02.292 --> 03:14:08.474]  Here's my last point, and we're going to jam in a few phone calls from folks who have been patiently holding Ron, Jack, Richard, and John.
[03:14:08.494 --> 03:14:10.775]  We'll just have time to get to those.
[03:14:11.416 --> 03:14:14.557]  But TSA invades roads, highways, with Viper checkpoints.
[03:14:14.957 --> 03:14:20.560]  They've got 9,000 locations with telescreens going up in shopping malls, Walmarts, saying, watch your neighbors.
[03:14:21.480 --> 03:14:30.826]  They're approaching every professional I know, my dad, doctors he knows, saying, you know, spy on your neighbors for us, we're Homeland Security.
[03:14:31.347 --> 03:14:36.770]  They are rolling out something by every historical yardstick that is super tyranny.
[03:14:37.511 --> 03:14:43.695]  And some people are waking up, others are waking up but getting scared, and others are just saying, this is freedom.
[03:14:43.975 --> 03:14:49.719]  Warrantless wiretapping, drones, the government taking veterans' death benefits.
[03:14:49.759 --> 03:14:50.439]  I mean, it's just...
[03:14:51.340 --> 03:15:01.069]  We're already living in incredible looting and stealing that's going on, and they want us to not trust each other and spy on each other instead of looking up the mountain at the globalists.
[03:15:01.349 --> 03:15:02.831]  They're the ones we should be watching.
[03:15:03.319 --> 03:15:03.699]  Exactly.
[03:15:04.000 --> 03:15:06.623]  And we were talking about it just now.
[03:15:06.643 --> 03:15:07.725]  I call it labeling.
[03:15:08.666 --> 03:15:13.091]  They label people so that you're all, if you like, tied with the same brush.
[03:15:13.111 --> 03:15:20.020]  This is what this Southern Poverty Law Center was trying to do and the ADL do when they talk about, you believe this?
[03:15:20.140 --> 03:15:22.103]  Oh, you're a far-right extremist.
[03:15:23.243 --> 03:15:30.486]  And of course what we're looking at again with the spy on your neighbor is just what we were talking about a few minutes ago.
[03:15:30.886 --> 03:15:41.510]  There are too few of them to control and keep surveillance on the population, so they have to get the target population to keep surveillance on each other.
[03:15:41.550 --> 03:15:44.151]  This is how it's working, divide and rule on a massive scale.
[03:15:44.191 --> 03:15:47.592]  The beast is trying to replicate itself and build the army it needs.
[03:15:47.832 --> 03:15:51.714]  That's why we've got to build our army of awakening now, so people recognize it.
[03:15:52.034 --> 03:15:52.414]  That's it.
[03:15:52.494 --> 03:15:55.776]  And the other thing you mentioned, a very relevant point, is embarrassment.
[03:15:55.796 --> 03:16:04.780]  Hey, you know, people, if you believed the world was a certain way, and now you're starting to realize it was nothing like that, nothing to be embarrassed about.
[03:16:05.120 --> 03:16:20.588]  From cradle to where you are now, you have been bombarded through your education system, through the media, day after day, minute by minute, with a certain view, an information source that tells you certain things are true about yourself, the world, and how it works.
[03:16:21.368 --> 03:16:26.172]  And therefore, don't be embarrassed about the fact that you bought it because almost anyone would buy it.
[03:16:26.252 --> 03:16:33.357]  Instead of that, celebrate, celebrate the fact that you have broken out of it and let's move on.
[03:16:33.437 --> 03:16:37.459]  Instead of, no it can't be like that because I must have been wrong earlier in my life.
[03:16:37.780 --> 03:16:41.982]  We're all wrong earlier in our life until we start to understand what's going on.
[03:16:42.243 --> 03:16:43.904]  So get used to it and get on with it.
[03:16:45.063 --> 03:16:45.643]  Absolutely.
[03:16:45.703 --> 03:16:50.506]  I liken it to a neighbor who you ask to water your plants, and you come back and your jewelry's all stolen.
[03:16:51.026 --> 03:16:52.667]  And then you go, well, it couldn't have been them that did it.
[03:16:52.687 --> 03:16:57.069]  And then you have them watch your house again, and now your TV gets stolen, and your computer.
[03:16:57.409 --> 03:17:00.011]  Pretty soon, you stop having that neighbor watch your stuff.
[03:17:00.471 --> 03:17:04.433]  We've just been trained to accept government megacorporations raping and robbing us.
[03:17:04.833 --> 03:17:05.513]  Wake up.
[03:17:05.573 --> 03:17:06.414]  Get off your knees.
[03:17:06.434 --> 03:17:07.314]  Get out of your trance.
[03:17:07.714 --> 03:17:08.715]  Ron in New York.
[03:17:08.995 --> 03:17:10.116]  You're on the air with David Icke.
[03:17:10.136 --> 03:17:12.677]  We're going through to 30 after, and then we're going to let him go in about 10 minutes.
[03:17:12.697 --> 03:17:13.317]  He's been gracious.
[03:17:13.617 --> 03:17:14.198]  Go ahead, Ron.
[03:17:14.838 --> 03:17:15.839]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.
[03:17:15.859 --> 03:17:28.276]  My call today, and I'd like to get both of your opinions on this, deals with the mayor of New York City latest foray into intruding in Tarazona with basically hired contract agents.
[03:17:28.316 --> 03:17:31.700]  Yeah, for those that don't know, they're going to gun shows, doing private sales,
[03:17:32.341 --> 03:17:34.923]  Telling people, oh my gosh, we bought guns without a background.
[03:17:35.243 --> 03:17:38.065]  Knowing that people don't know that it's legal to sell a gun to your neighbor.
[03:17:38.385 --> 03:17:41.026]  And what is Bloomberg getting ready to run for president doing?
[03:17:41.427 --> 03:17:42.828]  Suing gun manufacturers.
[03:17:43.148 --> 03:17:44.128]  Going to Arizona.
[03:17:44.429 --> 03:17:46.510]  I meant to get to that, I'm glad you brought it up, Ron.
[03:17:46.870 --> 03:17:48.831]  Running around trying to take our guns.
[03:17:50.092 --> 03:17:50.933]  Please continue, Ron.
[03:17:50.973 --> 03:17:52.854]  But David, why do they want our guns so bad?
[03:17:53.885 --> 03:18:00.930]  Well, again, it seems to be a theme today, shades of grey and being streetwise.
[03:18:01.330 --> 03:18:11.777]  Personally, I don't own guns, I don't want to own a gun and all the rest of it, and I don't want to resist with guns, I want to resist with non-violent, mass non-cooperation to stop
[03:18:11.937 --> 03:18:12.237]  I don't
[03:18:39.532 --> 03:18:42.479]  Let me throw this in because we're almost out of time and I want Ron to be able to finish.
[03:18:42.519 --> 03:18:45.807]  The point I'm making here, Alex, is an important one.
[03:18:46.408 --> 03:18:47.290]  What I'm saying is...
[03:18:48.446 --> 03:19:00.112]  Just because, people in America, you may not believe in guns, you may not want people to have guns, and there are many people that believe that, and it's a legitimate view, just as having them is a legitimate view.
[03:19:00.672 --> 03:19:03.734]  Please, see the shades of grey.
[03:19:03.834 --> 03:19:14.419]  Don't ask, don't get caught in the debate of guns or no guns, get caught in the understanding or the question, why do they want to take the guns from the population now?
[03:19:15.880 --> 03:19:19.582]  The agenda for that, who benefits from that from their point of view?
[03:19:19.902 --> 03:19:23.444]  Because they want us to get into this gun, no gun debate.
[03:19:24.005 --> 03:19:26.046]  Because that takes us over here.
[03:19:26.506 --> 03:19:31.168]  We need to focus, whether we believe in guns or whether we don't, on why they want to do it now.
[03:19:31.268 --> 03:19:31.809]  And it's because...
[03:19:32.589 --> 03:19:40.774]  They will find that easier, from their point of view, to, in their mind, to take over an unarmed population rather than an armed one.
[03:19:40.934 --> 03:19:47.178]  David, I want to be able to have Ron counter-backing it with some other calls, but let me just, myself, state this clearly, to use a Star Wars analogy.
[03:19:47.698 --> 03:19:51.401]  Obi-Wan Kenobi's not running around with his lightsaber killing innocent people.
[03:19:51.781 --> 03:19:53.042]  He uses it in defense.
[03:19:53.762 --> 03:20:01.087]  And the issue is, it's a major checkmate that if things get so desperate, and they're taking people to put them on trucks to FEMA camps,
[03:20:01.707 --> 03:20:04.728]  That if the Germans would have had guns and resisted, that wouldn't have happened.
[03:20:05.128 --> 03:20:06.629]  The same thing with Lenin or Stalin.
[03:20:06.849 --> 03:20:09.650]  And so I'm non-violent offensively.
[03:20:09.990 --> 03:20:12.131]  But nobody's taken my kids to a FEMA camp.
[03:20:12.431 --> 03:20:12.931]  Period.
[03:20:13.231 --> 03:20:14.452]  And they can't stand it.
[03:20:14.692 --> 03:20:15.432]  And they know it.
[03:20:15.732 --> 03:20:17.073]  And people need more guns.
[03:20:17.373 --> 03:20:19.493]  It's the answer against this tyranny.
[03:20:19.693 --> 03:20:23.295]  The counterbalance of power against this paramilitary globalist force.
[03:20:23.955 --> 03:20:26.536]  Massively in an arms race against the people.
[03:20:27.156 --> 03:20:28.997]  Ron in New York, your comment on that.
[03:20:29.733 --> 03:20:36.616]  Okay, my larger point was actually going to be about the spinning and manipulations of the media.
[03:20:37.096 --> 03:20:44.740]  I've noticed one thing from all the tapes I've seen where they have these videotapes supposedly of what took place in Arizona, these sales.
[03:20:45.606 --> 03:20:59.493]  And what I have noticed is that you do not see a sale come to fruition, meaning the guy makes a statement about, I can't pass a background check, but you don't actually see somebody transacting, giving him a firearm, and he gives them cash.
[03:20:59.934 --> 03:21:06.417]  Now, I've seen this been reported for two days now, and I find that unusual, and I begin to wonder whether there even was a transaction.
[03:21:06.457 --> 03:21:07.517]  We're just being manipulated.
[03:21:07.538 --> 03:21:09.038]  No, Ron, I mean, it's a great point.
[03:21:09.719 --> 03:21:11.680]  I mean, there is so much lying going on.
[03:21:11.700 --> 03:21:12.460]  I appreciate your call.
[03:21:12.660 --> 03:21:13.741]  Any other comments on that, David?
[03:21:14.742 --> 03:21:16.604]  Well, I worked in the media for a long time.
[03:21:16.624 --> 03:21:20.869]  The BBC and newspapers and radio in Britain.
[03:21:21.550 --> 03:21:22.812]  And if anyone saw
[03:21:24.770 --> 03:21:37.894]  The inside of a mainstream newsroom in whatever form it is, paper, television, radio, they would never believe a word they read or heard in the media again.
[03:21:38.014 --> 03:21:41.375]  Because A, you don't have to be intelligent.
[03:21:41.395 --> 03:21:42.756]  There are some intelligent journalists.
[03:21:42.816 --> 03:21:43.616]  You don't have to be.
[03:21:43.976 --> 03:21:45.497]  It's often a bad career move.
[03:21:45.857 --> 03:21:48.778]  And you certainly do not have to be informed.
[03:21:48.918 --> 03:21:49.598]  Some of the most
[03:21:50.018 --> 03:21:56.362]  Uninformed people I've ever met have been professional journalists and professional politicians.
[03:21:56.862 --> 03:21:59.824]  And there's also this lease line of resistance.
[03:22:00.384 --> 03:22:14.853]  If you are a proper journalist and you are interested in the truth, then you are going to constantly be in conflict with those running your media organization who don't want you to cross that line.
[03:22:15.233 --> 03:22:16.754]  So there comes a point where
[03:22:17.791 --> 03:22:18.031]  Yes.
[03:22:40.845 --> 03:22:41.526]  Absolutely.
[03:22:41.546 --> 03:22:52.755]  And if you play ball, then you ascend in that mainstream media system, but now people are aware of it, so it's falling apart, so the globalists are coming in, trying to restrict the alternative media, and the fight is on.
[03:22:53.235 --> 03:22:54.636]  Let's talk to Jack in Illinois.
[03:22:54.676 --> 03:22:56.157]  Jack, you're on the air with David Icke.
[03:22:56.818 --> 03:22:57.438]  Hi, gentlemen.
[03:22:57.699 --> 03:22:59.860]  I just have one quick... Hi, David.
[03:23:00.301 --> 03:23:02.142]  One comment and one quick question.
[03:23:02.583 --> 03:23:10.369]  I think it's important that people stay positive, because like attracts like, and also fearless, because at the end of the day,
[03:23:11.144 --> 03:23:15.367]  The light is going to prevail and everyone needs to have that reassurance.
[03:23:15.888 --> 03:23:19.130]  And then my question for you, David, is I'm a fan of yours.
[03:23:19.190 --> 03:23:20.731]  I've seen many of your videos.
[03:23:21.192 --> 03:23:26.376]  Could you please explain to Alex's listeners your concept of combing the mirror?
[03:23:28.080 --> 03:23:29.542]  Uh, calming the mirror, yeah.
[03:23:29.762 --> 03:23:34.469]  First of all, Jack, I absolutely agree with you about staying positive.
[03:23:35.691 --> 03:23:41.119]  I talk about the things that are happening and some of the things we need to do to stop them happening but my
[03:23:43.482 --> 03:23:47.224]  The view of the outcome is very, very positive.
[03:23:47.324 --> 03:23:52.687]  Well, it's positive to admit the bad, so then you can recognize the bad from the good.
[03:23:52.787 --> 03:23:55.309]  Yeah, this control system is coming down.
[03:23:55.369 --> 03:23:59.391]  My question is, how bad is it going to get before that comes?
[03:23:59.551 --> 03:24:01.993]  That's the question we need to answer ourselves.
[03:24:02.013 --> 03:24:05.475]  How much are we going to stand on the sidelines and let this go on unchallenged?
[03:24:06.455 --> 03:24:07.276]  We're good to go.
[03:24:21.881 --> 03:24:22.242]  All right.
[03:24:39.421 --> 03:24:42.645]  The world that we experience is like a movie screen.
[03:24:43.186 --> 03:24:48.132]  The inner self is like the projector at the back of the theatre.
[03:24:48.653 --> 03:24:55.602]  And we can stand and shout and cuss at the screen in the theatre for as long as we like.
[03:24:56.282 --> 03:24:57.423]  It ain't gonna change.
[03:24:57.803 --> 03:24:59.824]  It's hit the screen, it's a done deal.
[03:25:00.225 --> 03:25:03.727]  We have to go back to the projector and change the reel.
[03:25:04.187 --> 03:25:11.551]  And all the time, we're being encouraged to look outside of ourselves for answers, when the answers are actually within us.
[03:25:11.632 --> 03:25:17.835]  Because the world is a collective expression of the current state of the universe.
[03:25:17.875 --> 03:25:18.916]  Well, that's Plato's cave!
[03:25:18.976 --> 03:25:20.077]  That's Plato's cave!
[03:25:20.217 --> 03:25:24.779]  If they don't, yeah, if they don't stop that, if we don't change that, then nothing can change.
[03:25:24.840 --> 03:25:25.340]  For instance,
[03:25:26.175 --> 03:25:28.256]  Inner self, I have no power.
[03:25:29.096 --> 03:25:31.957]  Outer expression, a few people run the world.
[03:25:32.797 --> 03:25:37.499]  Inner self, I do not have the courage to stand up for what I believe in.
[03:25:37.519 --> 03:25:41.060]  Outer expression, a few people run the world.
[03:25:41.340 --> 03:25:43.301]  When we change, the world must change.
[03:25:43.341 --> 03:25:50.763]  Because the power that is being used to control us is the power we give away every minute of every day.
[03:25:50.823 --> 03:25:55.545]  When we stop doing that, the power dynamics shifts dramatically and it's all over.
[03:25:55.905 --> 03:25:56.265]  Absolutely.
[03:25:56.285 --> 03:26:00.467]  I'm going to jam in a few quick questions, a few final calls from Richard and John.
[03:26:00.507 --> 03:26:01.308]  We're out of time, David.
[03:26:01.328 --> 03:26:02.088]  This has been amazing.
[03:26:02.148 --> 03:26:08.891]  But just in my 16 years fighting the globalists, incredible success because I know history and believe in the destiny of liberty.
[03:26:09.191 --> 03:26:10.452]  You've had incredible success.
[03:26:10.772 --> 03:26:15.094]  There are other people more intelligent who have greater potential than you and I do.
[03:26:15.474 --> 03:26:19.276]  They need to realize they have that potential and step up to the plate.
[03:26:19.696 --> 03:26:21.777]  Richard in Canada, you're on the air with David Icke.
[03:26:21.797 --> 03:26:22.137]  Go ahead.
[03:26:22.790 --> 03:26:24.611]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's a pleasure to speak with you both.
[03:26:24.651 --> 03:26:26.692]  You both had a profound impact on my life.
[03:26:27.512 --> 03:26:28.413]  I have a quick question.
[03:26:28.433 --> 03:26:36.517]  Alex, you do an amazing job of exposing the globalists in the United States, and David, you do an amazing job exposing them in the UK.
[03:26:36.557 --> 03:26:39.398]  I find there's nobody here in Canada doing nearly as good of a job.
[03:26:39.678 --> 03:26:46.362]  I was just looking, I was going to ask if you guys could maybe impart on me a few tips on how to do your amazing research.
[03:26:47.262 --> 03:27:06.493]  I mean, really, it's just studying how the world works and knowing history and then clicking with the info and just being that leader in your area, picking the issues you're going to stand up for, whether it's having local media or the right to keep and bear arms or sovereignty or exposing your Prime Minister calling for world government.
[03:27:06.793 --> 03:27:07.594]  David, what's your view?
[03:27:08.414 --> 03:27:10.235]  Well, Richard, there's a blueprint.
[03:27:10.976 --> 03:27:16.079]  There's a blueprint that you find in every single country, and Canada is no different.
[03:27:16.279 --> 03:27:18.600]  In fact, it's one of the more extreme examples.
[03:27:19.020 --> 03:27:25.104]  You know, with my research over the years, watch the country that's next door to the country what the focus is on.
[03:27:25.564 --> 03:27:33.248]  You know, one of the great Illuminati centers on the planet is Austria, which is next door to the country that is focused on Germany.
[03:27:33.689 --> 03:27:43.014]  And so much stuff goes on in Canada, not least in Ontario, that crosses the border into America in various ways.
[03:27:43.374 --> 03:27:54.020]  So Canada is a very, very important place in this whole global arena, not least because, with the greatest respect, people are looking at the United States primarily and not to Canada.
[03:27:54.660 --> 03:27:55.300]  I'm sure you have.
[03:28:10.386 --> 03:28:11.487]  We're good to go.
[03:28:32.301 --> 03:28:33.542]  David, we're out of time.
[03:28:33.622 --> 03:28:34.802]  Richard, I appreciate your call.
[03:28:34.842 --> 03:28:35.462]  I'm sorry.
[03:28:35.923 --> 03:28:38.824]  But we'll try to jam John in with a quick final comment here.
[03:28:38.864 --> 03:28:40.485]  But it's very simple.
[03:28:40.525 --> 03:28:41.905]  There's a continuity of agenda.
[03:28:42.126 --> 03:28:45.387]  You find out there's global boards that are setting the standardized programs.
[03:28:45.887 --> 03:28:47.588]  That's where you're going to find the information.
[03:28:48.428 --> 03:28:49.309]  Excellent points, David.
[03:28:49.409 --> 03:28:50.529]  Quick question or comment.
[03:28:50.589 --> 03:28:51.370]  John in Illinois.
[03:28:51.410 --> 03:28:51.770]  Go ahead.
[03:28:51.790 --> 03:28:55.692]  It's truly an honor to be speaking with such great minds.
[03:28:56.483 --> 03:29:07.752]  Now, David, in this Egyptian uprising and then the more recent example in Tunisia, do you feel that this is part of the problem-reaction-solution-slash-order-out-of-chaos?
[03:29:07.832 --> 03:29:09.153]  Oh, we gotta get his answer, John.
[03:29:09.193 --> 03:29:10.194]  He must have missed him earlier.
[03:29:10.214 --> 03:29:10.814]  He said yes.
[03:29:11.575 --> 03:29:12.516]  David, final comments.
[03:29:13.276 --> 03:29:14.837]  Yes, but shades of grey.
[03:29:15.218 --> 03:29:23.323]  The people are overwhelmingly, absolutely, genuinely reacting and uprising to grotesque injustice.
[03:29:23.723 --> 03:29:42.596]  But we have to be streetwise to make sure that that reaction, that understandable response is not harnessed and handled so the outcome becomes what the people responsible for it, when you get behind the scenes, responsible for the injustice, I mean, don't come out with their men in power again.
[03:29:42.996 --> 03:29:43.817]  We're out of time.
[03:29:43.837 --> 03:29:45.520]  David Icke, incredible job.
[03:29:45.540 --> 03:29:47.482]  Pre-transmission starts now at Fulbright.com.
[03:29:49.205 --> 03:29:50.066]  We're on the march.
[03:29:50.566 --> 03:29:52.169]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:53.090 --> 03:29:55.793]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.086 --> 03:30:02.089]  Where have all the Military Surplus stores gone?
[03:30:02.289 --> 03:30:03.991]  Don't worry, you don't need one.
[03:30:04.231 --> 03:30:08.437]  Because everything you need at Military Surplus is at MainMilitary.com.
[03:30:08.677 --> 03:30:11.461]  That's M-A-I-N-E, Military.com.
[03:30:11.541 --> 03:30:13.003]  One of the last surviving true military stores.
