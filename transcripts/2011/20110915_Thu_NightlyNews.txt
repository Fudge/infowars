[00:00:43.928 --> 00:00:45.269]  It is Thursday, September 15, 2011.
[00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.553]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:48.973 --> 00:00:51.195]  This is InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:51.375 --> 00:00:55.539]  A true revolution in information warfare against tyranny.
[00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:56.881]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:56.981 --> 00:01:02.126]  It is you, the viewers, of this critical transmission that have made this program possible.
[00:01:03.567 --> 00:01:15.830]  Coming up tonight, we have got an amazing interview scheduled with Mark Moreno of Climate Depot, dealing with the fall of the greatest con artist of the 20th and 21st century.
[00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.370]  We're talking about Al Gore.
[00:01:17.711 --> 00:01:18.391]  That's coming up.
[00:01:18.851 --> 00:01:22.472]  Then we're going to talk to Wayne Madsen, who went to Indonesia.
[00:01:22.932 --> 00:01:28.933]  He's been getting death threats, you name it, and had CIA spooks following him, trying to shut down his interviews.
[00:01:29.434 --> 00:01:30.634]  He did confirm that
[00:01:31.494 --> 00:01:33.956]  Well, Obama did become an Indonesian citizen.
[00:01:34.356 --> 00:01:38.220]  This has incredible ramifications for his eligibility for the president.
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.102]  That's coming up at the end of the show tonight.
[00:01:42.003 --> 00:01:43.164]  It's supposed to be 30 minutes long.
[00:01:43.484 --> 00:01:44.765]  It's always an hour or more.
[00:01:45.106 --> 00:01:45.846]  We can't help it.
[00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:47.127]  There's too much information.
[00:01:47.167 --> 00:01:47.648]  It's real.
[00:01:47.948 --> 00:01:48.648]  It's unscripted.
[00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:49.990]  It's teleprompter free.
[00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.191]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:01:51.651 --> 00:01:53.733]  Now, let's get into the economy.
[00:01:54.983 --> 00:01:58.385]  It was always meant to be imploded by design.
[00:01:58.425 --> 00:02:01.946]  We told you three and a half years ago with the first banker bailout it was only going to get worse.
[00:02:02.446 --> 00:02:05.328]  We told you that every single point of the way since then.
[00:02:05.668 --> 00:02:12.871]  Not because we're being pessimistic, but because we know that if we reverse these globalist policies, we can have incredible prosperity.
[00:02:13.191 --> 00:02:15.893]  This is a consolidation of our economy.
[00:02:16.553 --> 00:02:21.656]  The United States has the highest poverty in its modern history in the last hundred years.
[00:02:21.696 --> 00:02:24.417]  That's been reported even by the Associated Press.
[00:02:25.097 --> 00:02:27.198]  It has just incredibly become a third world nation.
[00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.000]  Mortgage default warnings have surged in August.
[00:02:31.561 --> 00:02:37.323]  They believe it will be the biggest month ever by September for mortgages.
[00:02:37.384 --> 00:02:40.305]  How is that for your Obamanoid recovery?
[00:02:40.885 --> 00:02:45.668]  Continuing, again, jobless claims, inflation rise, manufacturing gets weaker.
[00:02:46.328 --> 00:02:53.250]  Well, they've got all these incredible regulations going against business here in our country.
[00:02:54.631 --> 00:02:56.431]  The bottom line is this.
[00:02:58.452 --> 00:03:08.475]  The social engineers have set up a depression by design so they can offer their solution, a global government run by the private banks that engineered this fraud.
[00:03:08.495 --> 00:03:10.976]  And if you give into that level,
[00:03:12.253 --> 00:03:14.094]  Of tyranny you'll give in to the next level.
[00:03:14.494 --> 00:03:15.394]  And that's what's happening.
[00:03:16.295 --> 00:03:18.556]  Now I want to go to a compilation of clips here.
[00:03:19.236 --> 00:03:27.700]  Of different White House officials and the head of the Federal Reserve, Tiny Tim Geithner, all of them, saying our economy was getting better in the last three years.
[00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.162]  The whole time they knew we were going into a depression.
[00:03:31.502 --> 00:03:32.022]  Here it is.
[00:03:32.302 --> 00:03:40.946]  The policies that we are undertaking, notwithstanding short-term fluctuations, will lead to a strong and stable dollar in the medium term.
[00:03:42.385 --> 00:03:48.187]  The American economy was falling off the cliff in the fall of 2008 and the first months of his administration.
[00:03:49.007 --> 00:03:55.829]  And he put in place the most creative, the most forceful set of economic measures we have ever done as a country.
[00:03:56.009 --> 00:04:01.390]  And because of that, we prevented a second Great Depression and the economy has now been growing for more than a year and a half.
[00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.151]  More than two million jobs in the private sector since job creation started again.
[00:04:05.371 --> 00:04:08.192]  Faster job creation than the last two recoveries.
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.001]  These are total BS numbers.
[00:04:13.341 --> 00:04:15.001]  They claim 9% unemployment.
[00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:16.862]  Even 60 Minutes says it's 22%.
[00:04:17.442 --> 00:04:19.723]  Most Economist, 24 or higher.
[00:04:20.363 --> 00:04:24.904]  Their answer is carbon taxes, more regulations on American business.
[00:04:26.065 --> 00:04:29.126]  They are killing this economy so they can consolidate it.
[00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:32.687]  And their answer to the next crisis is, give us more money.
[00:04:33.561 --> 00:04:35.681]  And then it's always, give us more money.
[00:04:36.482 --> 00:04:38.982]  And give the private offshore banks more of your tax money.
[00:04:39.662 --> 00:04:40.262]  It's amazing.
[00:04:40.922 --> 00:04:50.224]  Now, shifting gears into some other subjects, dealing with the incredible police state unfolding worldwide, not just here, but in England.
[00:04:50.884 --> 00:04:58.026]  Three-year-olds are branded racist and homophobic, put in government database.
[00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:11.748]  That's right, 30,000 plus, 34,000 children, including people as young as three, are now being put in criminal databases for bullying or repeating things they've seen on television.
[00:05:11.828 --> 00:05:17.251]  All part of the social engineers getting everybody into the criminal justice system.
[00:05:17.271 --> 00:05:18.572]  This is the new form of tyranny.
[00:05:18.972 --> 00:05:27.018]  The Daily Mail reported racists age three, toddlers among thousands of children, accused of bigotry after name-calling.
[00:05:28.308 --> 00:05:32.731]  This is the political correctness, divide and conquer, to get us all at each other's throats.
[00:05:33.531 --> 00:05:36.433]  As if a three-year-old knows what's going on, quote, racially.
[00:05:37.314 --> 00:05:38.494]  Continuing, don't worry.
[00:05:38.555 --> 00:05:42.617]  In Michigan, they've passed a law where they're putting everybody's children in a database.
[00:05:42.677 --> 00:05:45.359]  If you're even one pound overweight, you're put in a database.
[00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:52.804]  If your children don't make you lose the weight, you're taken to a CPS center and, well, put on drugs and the state government gets a bunch of money.
[00:05:53.804 --> 00:05:56.925]  In the process from the federal government for taking over your life.
[00:05:57.665 --> 00:05:58.505]  But don't worry, Ms.
[00:05:58.605 --> 00:06:02.446]  Obama is lauding the Olive Garden and other big chains.
[00:06:03.226 --> 00:06:10.668]  They have announced that they're not going to let people order food like full fat milk or french fries that isn't good for them.
[00:06:11.348 --> 00:06:17.630]  And she's lauding the fact that the restaurants are going to follow the federal government's orders and monitor everything people eat.
[00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:22.231]  And they're coming out with taxes against people who eat things that they say aren't healthy.
[00:06:22.791 --> 00:06:30.536]  And all over the Western world, they're talking about taking people's children away from them if they are shy.
[00:06:31.497 --> 00:06:37.521]  That's a normal instinct of boys and girls, of people they don't know, to not want to come over and talk to them.
[00:06:37.561 --> 00:06:41.084]  But the government's answer is, hey, Big Pharma paid us off.
[00:06:41.704 --> 00:06:42.905]  Your kid is shy.
[00:06:42.925 --> 00:06:45.947]  We're going to put them on a drug that's going to basically eat their brain.
[00:06:46.367 --> 00:06:47.128]  How's that sound?
[00:06:47.728 --> 00:06:56.691]  But don't worry, the social engineers know you're awake to sodium fluoride, radioactive isotopes, lead, mercury, arsenic in your tap water.
[00:06:57.212 --> 00:07:02.574]  So their answer is to fearmonger all over national TV and tell you that
[00:07:03.414 --> 00:07:10.102]  Apple juice is evil because it has biologically bound trace amounts of arsenic in the seeds.
[00:07:10.663 --> 00:07:22.957]  So when companies crush the entire apple, there's a tiny bit of arsenic that's been proven as a trace element that's needed for the uptake of other vitamins and minerals, but their answer is to start restricting that devilish apple juice.
[00:07:23.638 --> 00:07:26.399]  So that is going on as well.
[00:07:26.859 --> 00:07:42.043]  Now I played you that economic clip where they're telling you how wonderful the economy is, but George Soros, who said in the last five years he's having a great economic crisis, says that we must embrace mass centralization of power in Europe, a new banking dictatorship,
[00:07:42.743 --> 00:07:55.045]  Or another great depression will ensue and you give him more power and pay your taxes to him because he sold you some Ponzi scheme derivatives and things only get worse.
[00:07:55.205 --> 00:07:56.265]  They don't get better.
[00:07:56.626 --> 00:07:57.746]  That's the moral of the story.
[00:07:57.766 --> 00:08:03.547]  The globalists get you into a crisis and then always offer you more tyranny as a solution.
[00:08:04.007 --> 00:08:08.068]  Mark Moreno and then Wayne Madsen are coming up with some groundbreaking interviews.
[00:08:08.468 --> 00:08:10.328]  But first I want to get into some other treason.
[00:08:11.425 --> 00:08:23.288]  It is now admitted that France and England are sending a delegation to meet with Al-Qaeda, who they admit has been given control over the North African country of Libya.
[00:08:23.588 --> 00:08:25.189]  That is the areas that they control.
[00:08:25.809 --> 00:08:28.029]  Muammar Gaddafi is still fighting them.
[00:08:28.969 --> 00:08:33.851]  And they say that Al-Qaeda has been given cruise missiles and everything else, but as we pointed out,
[00:08:35.111 --> 00:08:48.619]  In association with this visit, they're not discussing the fact that they've put Al-Qaeda in power, but separately, in a schizophrenic fashion, NATO is coming out and saying they may have to have war with Al-Qaeda, who's now gotten control of Libya.
[00:08:48.979 --> 00:08:51.080]  These are the so-called freedom fighters.
[00:08:51.660 --> 00:09:02.807]  Now, getting into the Snoop Society this evening, Congressman Lamar Smith, from right here in Central Texas, has introduced the See Something, Say Something legislation.
[00:09:03.467 --> 00:09:13.775]  You know, in the Constitution you're able to face your accuser in court, but this says now that people can anonymously make up lies about you, and you can be thrown into a gulag for the rest of your life.
[00:09:14.235 --> 00:09:22.022]  And they're running TV ads everywhere saying if you see a piece of paper blowing down the road or a box on the side of the street, go into a hysteria and call the government.
[00:09:22.602 --> 00:09:23.843]  And that's already been happening.
[00:09:23.863 --> 00:09:32.350]  They've been at 50 plus airlines, the FBI admitted, on the last holiday shut down and land because people were kissing or went to the bathroom or
[00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:35.093]  One guy passed gas and everybody thought it was a bomb.
[00:09:35.133 --> 00:09:36.014]  I'm not joking.
[00:09:36.535 --> 00:09:38.717]  The wicked flee when none pursue.
[00:09:39.418 --> 00:09:40.600]  Land of the free, home of the brave?
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.363]  How about land of the cowards, home of the slaves?
[00:09:43.764 --> 00:09:49.791]  It's time to wake up and stop letting these criminals in government that are robbing the daylights out of us fearmonger us into submission.
[00:09:50.732 --> 00:10:00.937]  Meanwhile, more and more I see cases in the snitch society where people that don't buy the right hunting license are banned all over the country from hunting.
[00:10:01.277 --> 00:10:03.318]  You swipe your license to get a hunting license.
[00:10:04.378 --> 00:10:11.501]  And I saw a report out of the Salisbury Post today, the Drudge Report carried it as well, that a man who
[00:10:12.842 --> 00:10:21.745]  Didn't have the right license in another state to kill a 14-point white-tailed deer, has been globally banned in a global database from hunting.
[00:10:22.325 --> 00:10:34.689]  So, this is how freedom dies, not with a big bang, but with just a slow decline as this private corporate global government picks up steam against free humanity.
[00:10:35.589 --> 00:10:43.459]  We take you now, my friends, to an interview with Mark Moreno of Climate Depot and then Wayne Madsen.
[00:10:43.799 --> 00:10:45.781]  It's Infowars Nightly News.
[00:10:46.342 --> 00:10:50.908]  If you believe in this information and stand for true investigation and true debate,
[00:10:52.347 --> 00:11:01.196]  As this Nobel Prize winner does, standing up to Al Gore, you need to support and subscribe to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:11:01.216 --> 00:11:03.779]  Alright, we're about to go to Mark Moreno.
[00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:07.082]  Well, the story made headlines across the world.
[00:11:07.182 --> 00:11:12.047]  Nobel laureate resigns from society because of its global warming fear-mongering.
[00:11:12.844 --> 00:11:29.104]  We're going to talk to Mark Moreno, really one of the leading people in the last decade exposing the fraud of man-made global warming or anthropogenic warming, to discuss the fact that Al Gore has gone from saying that he is the ruler of the earth, the high priest,
[00:11:29.605 --> 00:11:44.882]  Who speaks the truth and no one can challenge him to now scrabbling around behaving like the con artist he is and desperately trying to get people to pay attention to him and telling the world that he controls reality but everything is conspiring against him.
[00:11:45.402 --> 00:11:56.815]  The sea levels are dropping, the ice is growing at record rates, and more and more scientists are pointing out it's the sun, not carbon dioxide that's less than 1% of the world's atmosphere.
[00:11:57.276 --> 00:12:02.101]  Joining us to break all of this down is Mark Moreno, a voice in the wilderness long ago.
[00:12:02.802 --> 00:12:06.906]  But he stuck to the facts, so now the truth is coming out on top.
[00:12:07.266 --> 00:12:08.447]  Mark, thank you for joining us.
[00:12:08.767 --> 00:12:15.694]  But you warned me, joining us live on Skype, a thunderstorm is rolling in right now, which we never had thunderstorms or rain before.
[00:12:16.214 --> 00:12:16.875]  So perhaps...
[00:12:18.263 --> 00:12:25.390]  Never had weather before man-made global warming, so it's possible that one of Al Gore's predicted storms could interrupt our interview here.
[00:12:25.571 --> 00:12:26.432]  Well, yeah, everything.
[00:12:26.512 --> 00:12:30.015]  Dust storms, earthquakes, hot weather, cold weather.
[00:12:30.396 --> 00:12:34.480]  I mean, rain never fell until man did bad things.
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:39.025]  So, do you want to apologize right now that there's a storm maybe approaching right now?
[00:12:39.963 --> 00:12:44.226]  Yes, I do, and if you look at this, I wish we had had carbon taxes in the 1930s.
[00:12:44.286 --> 00:12:46.808]  We could have prevented the Dust Bowl drought from happening.
[00:12:47.168 --> 00:12:49.049]  If only we had visionaries back then.
[00:12:49.729 --> 00:12:51.110]  The inventor of the Internet!
[00:12:53.012 --> 00:13:04.699]  Yes, what's happened now is Al Gore has started his 24-hour campaign, and it is so atrocious, so offensive, that even committed global warmists are bailing on Al Gore.
[00:13:04.739 --> 00:13:08.682]  The UK Guardian's Leo Hickman has said his stomach sank
[00:13:08.962 --> 00:13:14.865]  When he started watching it, he couldn't believe that every bad weather event was being linked to global warming.
[00:13:15.045 --> 00:13:18.386]  He said Al Gore is opening himself up to charges of being an alarmist.
[00:13:18.626 --> 00:13:20.647]  He said it's not what you want to peg your hat on.
[00:13:21.107 --> 00:13:28.150]  Committed global warmists are asking the question, as the UK Guardian did today, is Al Gore helping the global warming cause?
[00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:30.591]  Al Gore is losing his own people!
[00:13:30.751 --> 00:13:32.092]  He's so off the reservation.
[00:13:32.392 --> 00:13:35.296]  Well, I'm glad you raised that, because I just saw that this afternoon.
[00:13:35.716 --> 00:13:49.875]  When I saw the promo video yesterday, it was like, in that weird, fake, feminine voice he's got, that sounds like the biggest con artist on Earth, out of some Lovecraft novel, he's saying, storms, fires, rain,
[00:13:51.316 --> 00:13:52.537]  Ugh, pay me money!
[00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:54.339]  No one can question us!
[00:13:54.419 --> 00:13:58.182]  I mean, it just looks like someone bleeding out and floundering.
[00:13:58.522 --> 00:13:59.283]  Here's my question.
[00:13:59.423 --> 00:14:03.126]  Is Al Gore on the edge of the precipice, or has he already fallen off of it?
[00:14:03.467 --> 00:14:05.849]  Can Humpty Dumpty be put back together again?
[00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:07.301]  I don't know.
[00:14:07.341 --> 00:14:10.665]  I mean, we could declare him dead for so long.
[00:14:10.745 --> 00:14:20.699]  The problem is, the difference between man-made global warming and all the other eco-scares is this is the most well-funded scare by a factor of a thousand over all the previous scares.
[00:14:20.719 --> 00:14:24.323]  Global cooling, overpopulation, the Amazon rainforest disappearing.
[00:14:25.525 --> 00:14:28.727]  No eco-scare has been this institutionalized and funded.
[00:14:29.128 --> 00:14:31.710]  So Al Gore just keeps reinventing himself.
[00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:36.934]  He was talking about unprecedented global warming, but now he's forced to talk about extreme weather.
[00:14:37.255 --> 00:14:38.796]  A flood here, a hurricane there.
[00:14:39.336 --> 00:14:42.139]  There is absolutely no data to support what he's saying.
[00:14:42.159 --> 00:14:48.464]  We have at Climate Depot peer-reviewed studies showing the Russian heatwave that Gore likes to cite was not due to man-made global warming.
[00:14:48.624 --> 00:14:51.367]  That floods were not due to man-made global warming.
[00:14:51.947 --> 00:14:56.209]  As he's speaking this week, Alex, it's as though Mother Nature's playing a joke on him.
[00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:59.851]  We're getting summertime snow in Colorado, record cold in Iowa.
[00:15:00.172 --> 00:15:03.193]  We're getting crops destroyed by freezes in Minnesota.
[00:15:03.293 --> 00:15:03.833]  I saw that!
[00:15:03.894 --> 00:15:05.274]  Huge snows in Aspen!
[00:15:06.775 --> 00:15:07.335]  Well, that's right!
[00:15:35.450 --> 00:16:04.820]  In fact, he chose yesterday and today as the launch of his 24 hours of baloney, or what he calls reality, because this is the date he picked, what, many years ago, that LA would be underwater, New York, and instead Der Spiegel says we still believe in man-made climate change, not warming, change, seasons didn't exist until now, pay them money or we're all dead, but now Der Spiegel's saying sea levels dropping is global warming.
[00:16:05.714 --> 00:16:07.676]  Yes, absolutely.
[00:16:07.756 --> 00:16:08.596]  No matter what happens.
[00:16:08.636 --> 00:16:14.941]  And here at Climate People, we actually documented dozens of peer-reviewed studies literally predicting the exact opposite of each other.
[00:16:14.961 --> 00:16:20.466]  We have studies predicting more drought, less drought, more floods, less floods, more hurricanes, less hurricanes.
[00:16:20.906 --> 00:16:21.787]  And why do they do that?
[00:16:22.067 --> 00:16:25.790]  Now, no matter what weather event happens, they can say, we predicted it!
[00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:28.993]  And the bottom line is they predict everything and anything.
[00:16:29.353 --> 00:16:35.538]  Whatever the weather, whether ice caps expand or retreat, it's all consistent with man-made
[00:16:35.758 --> 00:16:37.139]  And this is the new attack pattern.
[00:16:37.159 --> 00:16:38.400]  I've noticed this the last two years.
[00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:40.982]  What, two years ago that Obama talking point came out.
[00:16:41.002 --> 00:16:42.443]  Even the New York Times reported on it.
[00:16:42.743 --> 00:16:47.486]  They just said, we're going to call all change, seasons, snow, hot, cold, everything.
[00:16:47.506 --> 00:16:54.411]  So it's kind of like buying every square on a craps table or every number on a roulette.
[00:16:54.811 --> 00:16:59.434]  And so no matter what happens, they're like, oh my God, there were forest fires.
[00:17:00.975 --> 00:17:01.896]  Oh my God.
[00:17:02.156 --> 00:17:05.338]  But then meanwhile, the sun has nothing to do with it, they claim.
[00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:08.321]  No, in fact, here's the real story.
[00:17:08.841 --> 00:17:14.146]  Hundreds of factors make up our global temperature, and even warmest sites like realclimate.org has admitted this.
[00:17:14.587 --> 00:17:24.777]  Everything from tilt of the Earth's axis to ocean cycles to clouds, water vapor, methane, CO2, volcanoes, land use, deforestation, you name it.
[00:17:25.197 --> 00:17:38.567]  And what Al Gore has tried to do, and what the global warmists have tried to do through the United Nations, through the corrupted science, is try to claim that one of these hundreds of factors that influence our temperature, if we can tweak that on the margin, we can somehow control the Earth's thermostat.
[00:17:38.907 --> 00:17:41.109]  This is now classic witch-burning.
[00:17:41.269 --> 00:17:44.031]  Al Gore is engaging in a classic witch-burner mentality.
[00:17:44.331 --> 00:17:52.958]  He's basically saying, we never had this kind of weather before those witches moved in the neighborhood, before you owned your SUV, before you had central air conditioning and heating in your home.
[00:17:53.378 --> 00:17:54.299]  And they want people
[00:17:54.899 --> 00:18:03.865]  Not only to feel guilty, but they want them to think that acts of United Nations treaties and acts of Congress, taxes, and legislation can control the weather.
[00:18:04.145 --> 00:18:14.072]  We are no better now than pagan cultures, than ancient civilizations like the Aztecs in 1450 who slaughtered thousands of people to appease the angry gods to end a drought.
[00:18:14.652 --> 00:18:19.415]  Al Gore thinks we can tax and regulate ourselves to perfect weather.
[00:18:19.695 --> 00:18:22.617]  This is obscene, and again, even the global
[00:18:22.737 --> 00:18:23.418]  We're good to go.
[00:18:42.091 --> 00:18:42.871]  Well, that was my point.
[00:19:06.963 --> 00:19:07.243]  Yeah.
[00:19:37.423 --> 00:20:03.779]  You've got this gas that's 0.0360 and has been 30% of the atmosphere before, thousands of times higher, last 200,000 years, 14 times higher, and this thing clearly in the public graphs in every university, heat goes up, carbon dioxide goes up after it, and he's lying and flipping it, and all of this hoax comes out, and his response is to come out and say, we're hoaxing.
[00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:06.221]  Here's my question for you.
[00:20:07.222 --> 00:20:08.583]  What's the counter-attack?
[00:20:08.603 --> 00:20:20.351]  Because as you and others have pointed out, Lord Monckton was on with us yesterday, $100 billion spent in the US alone, hundreds of billions total globally, to push this guilt
[00:20:21.952 --> 00:20:30.675]  Where school children cry that they're killing the earth and pay money to Al Gore, you know, let them, Green Police, go in your house.
[00:20:30.735 --> 00:20:35.577]  So it doesn't matter that this has all been exposed in England, Australia, who are about five years ahead of us, as you know.
[00:20:35.918 --> 00:20:38.839]  The Green Police are now out there digging through trash cans, going in the houses.
[00:20:39.239 --> 00:20:40.959]  This is their authoritarian cover.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:49.523]  So, how are they going to respond to the fact that their cult is falling in on itself, A, and B, how do we counter that, Mark Moreno?
[00:20:50.188 --> 00:21:03.338]  Well, unfortunately, they respond by having the regulatory authority of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the EPA, was granted the authority by the United States Supreme Court to regulate what we exhale from our mouth.
[00:21:03.718 --> 00:21:05.099]  That is our greatest threat.
[00:21:05.259 --> 00:21:16.528]  Unelected bureaucrats in government doing what Congress, what the American people would not allow Congress to do, and that's regulate CO2, a trace essential gas in the atmosphere, and by the way,
[00:21:17.108 --> 00:21:22.030]  You look at hurricane activity, 30-40 year historic lows as CO2 has risen.
[00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:26.912]  In fact, CO2, big hurricanes were bigger when we had less CO2 in the atmosphere.
[00:21:27.132 --> 00:21:32.454]  Tornadoes, the big tornadoes have declined dramatically since the 1970s as CO2 has climbed.
[00:21:32.674 --> 00:21:35.555]  As we mentioned, sea levels, no acceleration, it's actually dropping.
[00:21:36.195 --> 00:21:41.778]  So, they haven't got the science, but they have got the government, the bureaucrats.
[00:21:41.958 --> 00:21:42.939]  They're going to keep coming in.
[00:21:43.479 --> 00:21:45.100]  Al Gore is not giving up on this.
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:46.621]  The United Nations is not giving up on this.
[00:21:46.641 --> 00:21:47.561]  They've got the arrogance.
[00:21:47.602 --> 00:21:49.883]  They're never going to stop with their scams.
[00:21:50.283 --> 00:21:54.025]  He might as well say he made the planet, not just the internet.
[00:21:54.065 --> 00:21:55.666]  He sold us NAFTA and GATT.
[00:21:56.066 --> 00:21:57.367]  This guy is pure poison.
[00:21:57.687 --> 00:22:03.410]  He literally is a dagger trying to slit the throat of this country, shut down our power sources, everything.
[00:22:04.611 --> 00:22:11.216]  They're not going away, and the EPA is saying they don't care what Congress has done, they're going to go forward.
[00:22:12.117 --> 00:22:20.664]  Is it a victory that at least Obama said he's going to back off some of these new carbon tax regulations last week?
[00:22:20.784 --> 00:22:21.485]  Is that a victory?
[00:22:22.005 --> 00:22:25.188]  It's a very delayed, it's a delaying tactic.
[00:22:25.208 --> 00:22:30.372]  What it all comes down to is the next president, it's going to be key, what they do with the EPA.
[00:22:30.632 --> 00:22:31.853]  If Obama's re-elected,
[00:22:32.313 --> 00:22:34.455]  He will go forward with the CO2 regulations.
[00:22:34.495 --> 00:22:36.676]  He'll go forward with all these shutting down of coal plants.
[00:22:36.696 --> 00:22:38.577]  They're already still, the coal plants are still, we're doomed.
[00:22:38.838 --> 00:22:46.563]  You have Republican, alleged Republican mayors like Bloomberg bragging that he's stopping hundreds of coal plants from being built by aligning themselves with environmentalists.
[00:22:46.983 --> 00:22:50.625]  Coal plants that provide 50% of our electricity in this country.
[00:22:50.946 --> 00:22:54.228]  Coal plants that keep people alive in record cold winters.
[00:22:54.568 --> 00:22:59.211]  Coal plants that power our modern way of life.
[00:22:59.391 --> 00:23:01.773]  Carbon based energy, one of the greatest liberators of mankind.
[00:23:02.073 --> 00:23:02.893]  They've reversed it all!
[00:23:03.113 --> 00:23:06.495]  Crony Capital, they have all these green job scams unraveling before them.
[00:23:06.875 --> 00:23:07.875]  They're not giving up.
[00:23:08.295 --> 00:23:12.277]  But the bottom line is, the American people have stopped them thus far.
[00:23:12.557 --> 00:23:16.338]  As long as we keep our feet to their throats, we can prevent this.
[00:23:16.638 --> 00:23:17.679]  We have prevented it.
[00:23:17.719 --> 00:23:19.619]  We shut down the climate bill in Congress.
[00:23:19.959 --> 00:23:22.860]  I credit talk radio almost single-handedly with doing that.
[00:23:23.261 --> 00:23:24.401]  They were terrified.
[00:23:24.421 --> 00:23:29.823]  You had people like John Kerry, the Senator from Massachusetts, terrified to utter the phrase global warming.
[00:23:30.243 --> 00:23:31.184]  On the Senate floor.
[00:23:31.444 --> 00:23:35.989]  We intimidated the authors of the climate bills to be terrified of their own issue.
[00:23:36.289 --> 00:23:42.396]  We had Barbara Boxer wouldn't even cite the United Nations as a source anymore after Climategate because of the scandals.
[00:23:42.736 --> 00:23:44.097]  So we have made progress.
[00:23:44.438 --> 00:23:46.259]  The problem is, and the history of America is,
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.322]  The more progress we make, the more devious they get, and the more successful, you could argue, they'll get behind the scenes.
[00:23:52.382 --> 00:23:57.324]  And that's where we have to be careful of the backdoor climate bill through the EPA.
[00:23:57.564 --> 00:23:59.224]  But Mark, hold on.
[00:23:59.825 --> 00:24:04.406]  Trees are blowing a little bit behind you, and he showed me a video yesterday.
[00:24:04.906 --> 00:24:07.367]  He said if trees move, that's because I've been bad.
[00:24:07.908 --> 00:24:14.310]  And if I pay him money, and let control freaks come in my house and inspect me, and my light bulbs, my toilet,
[00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:19.653]  Knock the windows out of my SUV like they do here in Austin, that he'll keep me safe.
[00:24:19.753 --> 00:24:24.536]  So, you know, I just don't understand why you're a denier.
[00:24:25.257 --> 00:24:25.657]  Why?
[00:24:25.677 --> 00:24:29.320]  Because, I mean, look, man, Mark, let's just admit right now, you're crazy.
[00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:35.384]  You actually know that carbon dioxide was higher in the past, which is a fact, but you're still stating it.
[00:24:35.424 --> 00:24:36.325]  That means you're a cultist.
[00:24:37.206 --> 00:24:46.734]  You know that the sun is driving, of all the factors, the largest effect on climate, and you're just not going along with it.
[00:24:47.254 --> 00:24:54.080]  Wouldn't it just be better to slit your wrist politically and psychologically and spiritually and get into that hot bathtub with Al Gore?
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:55.421]  I mean, man, bear a pig.
[00:24:57.242 --> 00:24:59.123]  ManBearPig cares about America.
[00:24:59.143 --> 00:25:04.947]  And you know, I've been sarcastic, but closing here, at the end of the day, we know it's a power grab.
[00:25:05.448 --> 00:25:08.009]  GE can keep its plants open, the competition can't.
[00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:13.953]  We understand it's a guilt-ridden mafia, a new form of scientific authoritarianism, guilt-driven.
[00:25:14.314 --> 00:25:17.356]  I understand all that, but from your decades of research,
[00:25:17.896 --> 00:25:19.918]  What is at the core of these control freaks?
[00:25:19.998 --> 00:25:29.108]  Why does Al Gore and Maurice Strong and the Goddard Space Center head Hanson, why do they say they want to destroy America and destroy an industrial society?
[00:25:29.468 --> 00:25:34.253]  Is it just because their investments are in China and by shutting us down their investments go up?
[00:25:34.573 --> 00:25:35.234]  Or is it more?
[00:25:35.654 --> 00:25:37.576]  Why do they hate humanity so much?
[00:25:38.137 --> 00:25:38.717]  Much more than that.
[00:25:38.737 --> 00:25:42.579]  I mean, you have to look at people like Paul Ehrlich, who wanted forced sterilization agents in our water.
[00:25:42.599 --> 00:25:48.622]  You have to look at Obama's science war, John Holdren, who actually said cheap energy is one of the hazards of a free society.
[00:25:48.642 --> 00:25:51.023]  This is an anti-human agenda.
[00:25:51.483 --> 00:25:55.205]  One of the co-founders of Greenpeace, Patrick Moore, left Greenpeace in the 80s, said it.
[00:25:55.245 --> 00:25:59.167]  The environmentalists today are practicing an anti-human agenda.
[00:25:59.407 --> 00:26:06.270]  You have Vaclav Klaas, the president of the Czech Republic, who's openly said, since the fall of communism, the greatest threat to personal freedom
[00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:06.910]  We're good.
[00:26:23.584 --> 00:26:24.325]  Regulating us.
[00:26:24.866 --> 00:26:29.851]  And this is very simply summed up by saying the more the plans fail, the more the planners plan.
[00:26:30.171 --> 00:26:31.092]  And that's what it's about.
[00:26:31.132 --> 00:26:33.975]  These are bean counters who think they know how to control our lives.
[00:26:34.335 --> 00:26:37.258]  It's an ideology of central planning at its core.
[00:26:37.939 --> 00:26:39.661]  Profit motive, I think, secondary.
[00:26:40.261 --> 00:26:53.244]  So it's a cult of control freaks that want to come in Mark Moreno and Alex Jones' house and want to tell little kids and scare the daylights out of them, look trees are blowing, pay this big fat con artist money and he'll protect you.
[00:26:53.504 --> 00:27:01.306]  The good news is we've seen them with their facade of arrogant confidence man to now just grasping at straws and desperate.
[00:27:01.966 --> 00:27:10.069]  I know we can beat them, and is it too positive to say that basically we're about 10 rounds in and we're really kicking their ass?
[00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:11.290]  We are.
[00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:17.393]  But if we look back, a lot of our defeats have come in the 12th round or the 15th round, depending on how many rounds you're playing.
[00:27:17.713 --> 00:27:18.813]  So you can't let up.
[00:27:19.213 --> 00:27:24.776]  And the greatest threat we've faced, I submit to you this, Alex, is a weak Republican president.
[00:27:25.036 --> 00:27:30.418]  A weak Republican president would pass a climate bill and a Republican Congress would go along with it.
[00:27:30.418 --> 00:27:32.160]  I'm glad you raised it, let me stop you.
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:36.484]  We've got formerly worked with Al Gore, Rick Perry.
[00:27:37.205 --> 00:27:41.069]  We've got Mitt Romney, Al Gore praises him for supporting carbon taxes.
[00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:46.055]  We've got Newt Gingrich supporting it and doing TV ads with idiots like Al Sharpton.
[00:27:47.076 --> 00:27:49.979]  So, out of the field then, who would you vote for?
[00:27:50.782 --> 00:27:54.304]  Well, Perry talks exactly right on the issue.
[00:27:54.545 --> 00:27:57.567]  The question is, is he going to follow through?
[00:27:57.667 --> 00:27:58.988]  Perry has the rhetoric down.
[00:27:59.428 --> 00:28:01.009]  You mentioned Romney, Gingrich, all horrible.
[00:28:01.049 --> 00:28:04.631]  Rick Santorum has a very good position on climate change, Herman Cain, Ron Paul.
[00:28:05.792 --> 00:28:13.017]  If your issue is climate, it comes down to how much you trust Rick Perry on the issue, because he's saying the right things, although not very articulately at the moment.
[00:28:13.838 --> 00:28:18.281]  And then otherwise, Ron Paul has said the right thing, and as long as you keep government
[00:28:18.801 --> 00:28:19.781]  From doing anything.
[00:28:20.362 --> 00:28:22.742]  It doesn't really matter what a candidate believes in the science.
[00:28:23.142 --> 00:28:26.383]  The problem is it's really going to come down to defunding this as well.
[00:28:26.443 --> 00:28:32.986]  You can't have a President Romney or someone like that is going to come in who's explicitly stated they support Al Gore's view of the science.
[00:28:33.506 --> 00:28:36.947]  Doesn't look likely to cut and defund this scam.
[00:28:37.227 --> 00:28:38.287]  And that's what needs to happen.
[00:28:38.327 --> 00:28:41.828]  From the EPA, the Department of Energy, to our National Academy of Science.
[00:28:41.908 --> 00:28:44.409]  Our National Academy of Science is a sham.
[00:28:45.049 --> 00:28:46.790]  It took six million dollars to study
[00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:47.410]  No.
[00:29:04.077 --> 00:29:08.358]  And there are only two dozen members of the governing boards that vote for statements supporting man-made global warming.
[00:29:08.498 --> 00:29:13.980]  This is why you had a Nobel Prize-winning physicist just resign another science group, the American Physical Society.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.381]  Well, Mark, that was my next point, and the final close, because I know you're busy and we've got to get on to other stuff here.
[00:29:19.421 --> 00:29:21.241]  We could talk for ten days about these criminals.
[00:29:21.942 --> 00:29:26.603]  Is that all these prominent scientists, even people that have supported it, are saying, look, this is bull.
[00:29:26.863 --> 00:29:30.524]  Your claim that this evidence can't even be looked at is anti-scientific.
[00:29:31.204 --> 00:29:38.832]  Finally, in the final equation, you've talked some about the ways this cancer is trying to survive and metastasize.
[00:29:39.393 --> 00:29:53.988]  How do we finally beat these people, A, and B, and this is most important, is it an overstatement by me, this is the most important issue in the world, because when I see globalists, one-worlders, consolidators, big megabanks,
[00:29:54.548 --> 00:29:59.353]  They are the ones funding this, and I've never seen hundreds of billions put into anything.
[00:29:59.673 --> 00:30:10.644]  This is their excuse to set up this global, bureaucratic, socialist, anti-human system, and people need to wake up, in my view, that this is the big enchilada.
[00:30:11.184 --> 00:30:12.245]  This is the Death Star.
[00:30:12.606 --> 00:30:16.730]  We have got to blow this thing up, because everything else is a side issue.
[00:30:17.569 --> 00:30:18.690]  Absolutely, and that's what's scary.
[00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:24.135]  When any candidate or anyone running for office accepts the science, you're basically doomed long-term.
[00:30:24.556 --> 00:30:33.204]  And what we're finding here in Germany, the German climate advisor is calling for a CO2 budget for every man, woman, and child on the planet, Alex.
[00:30:33.404 --> 00:30:33.904]  England is!
[00:30:34.485 --> 00:30:34.705]  Jesus.
[00:30:34.725 --> 00:30:34.905]  Jesus.
[00:30:53.619 --> 00:30:55.101]  This is not a coincidence.
[00:30:55.141 --> 00:30:58.744]  This is the way they want to lead and they want to control.
[00:30:58.784 --> 00:31:02.228]  They don't think free men and free women can make decisions on their own.
[00:31:02.288 --> 00:31:08.574]  It's got to be a planned, managed economy, an energy economy, and it's immoral and repulsive what's happening.
[00:31:09.175 --> 00:31:10.036]  We're good to go.
[00:31:36.698 --> 00:31:37.078]  Exactly!
[00:31:37.098 --> 00:31:40.781]  These politicians try to sound reasonable and let this con artist Al Gore and the U.N.
[00:31:40.861 --> 00:31:43.982]  and then have a serious, you know, debate with them when they're proven fraudsters.
[00:31:44.002 --> 00:31:44.423]  But listen,
[00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:12.409]  By the way, Al Gore's spokeswoman canceled a debate at the last minute last night on another radio show with a global warming skeptic saying she didn't want to get into it.
[00:32:12.429 --> 00:32:16.492]  So Al Gore's organization yet again has denied debating.
[00:32:16.732 --> 00:32:18.494]  Al Gore has never debated.
[00:32:18.534 --> 00:32:20.336]  As you know, Lord Monckton has challenged him.
[00:32:21.076 --> 00:32:23.438]  Come on, Al, baby!
[00:32:23.458 --> 00:32:26.361]  That's my point here, is that I have three children.
[00:32:26.861 --> 00:32:28.582]  I've studied political systems.
[00:32:28.863 --> 00:32:29.864]  I'm a history buff.
[00:32:30.732 --> 00:32:37.618]  And for anybody out there watching, you know, this Al Gore crap that we're oil company funded, I get zero money from oil companies.
[00:32:37.678 --> 00:32:41.421]  Most big oil companies are supporting it because they want to shut down coal.
[00:32:42.502 --> 00:32:43.863]  I don't get any money from coal either.
[00:32:44.183 --> 00:32:45.524]  I'm not saying this stuff's perfect.
[00:32:45.564 --> 00:32:46.545]  There could be new energies.
[00:32:47.005 --> 00:32:49.327]  The point is, this is authoritarianism, Mark.
[00:32:49.647 --> 00:32:53.050]  We think of authoritarianism as Hitler or Stalin or Mao.
[00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:54.992]  Old images 50, 60 years ago.
[00:32:55.452 --> 00:32:57.734]  Every new generation has a new authoritarianism.
[00:32:58.214 --> 00:33:01.577]  And this cult of control freaks, I read their writings.
[00:33:01.597 --> 00:33:02.537]  They hate humanity.
[00:33:02.557 --> 00:33:03.518]  They're anti-human.
[00:33:03.979 --> 00:33:05.960]  And they're such degenerate liars.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.382]  And I'm so glad Climate Depot is there.
[00:33:08.442 --> 00:33:10.924]  And thank God you're there eloquently fighting them.
[00:33:11.144 --> 00:33:11.664]  But you're right.
[00:33:11.684 --> 00:33:14.507]  We've got to stay on them and route them out.
[00:33:14.987 --> 00:33:17.089]  And that's the final caveat here.
[00:33:17.109 --> 00:33:18.510]  This interview is going over, but it's so important.
[00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:19.310]  We appreciate your time.
[00:33:19.611 --> 00:33:20.631]  What about this call?
[00:33:20.651 --> 00:33:22.092]  Because it's now happening against me.
[00:33:22.873 --> 00:33:25.035]  Where they're saying, go after them, get them.
[00:33:25.356 --> 00:33:27.998]  They're like racist, as Al Gore said in the 60s.
[00:33:28.459 --> 00:33:33.023]  And arrest Moreno, Jones, Moncton, Ron Paul.
[00:33:33.304 --> 00:33:39.810]  I mean, these people are such authoritarians, they call it green fascism and say authoritarianism is good.
[00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:43.815]  I mean, can't people see a Hitler when they declare themselves?
[00:33:44.622 --> 00:33:53.705]  Well, this is, you know, we have Grist Magazine, a big environmental magazine, actually called for Nuremberg-style trials for global warming skeptics, comparing us to Nazi war criminals.
[00:33:54.326 --> 00:34:02.549]  Al Gore has said we're flat earthers, we're people who believe the moon landing was fake, despite the fact that astronauts who walked on the moon are major global warming skeptics.
[00:34:03.149 --> 00:34:03.470]  I don't
[00:34:23.073 --> 00:34:24.395]  Why do they miscalculate?
[00:34:24.415 --> 00:34:25.496]  I've got to ask this.
[00:34:25.977 --> 00:34:26.998]  Why do they miscalculate?
[00:34:27.018 --> 00:34:27.859]  Because I agree with you.
[00:34:28.139 --> 00:34:32.043]  Historically, when you crush people and intimidate people, they fight back.
[00:34:32.464 --> 00:34:37.229]  Why do these global warmists, control freaks, scum, authoritarians, and again...
[00:34:37.950 --> 00:34:39.611]  Worse than that, words can't describe them.
[00:34:39.972 --> 00:34:46.897]  Why do they think by intimidating and firing real scientists and attacking us and saying arrest us, why do they think it would make us shut up?
[00:34:47.237 --> 00:34:47.958]  I agree with you.
[00:34:48.178 --> 00:34:52.161]  This is why people are fighting them, because they see the authoritarian nature.
[00:34:52.401 --> 00:34:58.986]  A lot of people that bought into global warming, as you mentioned, Nobel Prize winners, go, well, since they're being authoritarian, let me look at it.
[00:34:59.286 --> 00:35:00.868]  They look at it and find out it's pure bull.
[00:35:01.559 --> 00:35:02.500]  Here's the simple reason.
[00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:03.680]  They think it's 1985.
[00:35:03.881 --> 00:35:05.922]  They think it's 1975.
[00:35:06.142 --> 00:35:15.348]  They have not adjusted to the new reality of talk radio, cable news, the internet, and what they did, what Al Gore and the United Nations and the media tried to do in 2007 and 2008.
[00:35:17.029 --> 00:35:22.733]  May have worked in 1977 or 1985, but it wasn't going to work in 2007 and 2008.
[00:35:23.254 --> 00:35:25.976]  The world exploded around them.
[00:35:26.016 --> 00:35:28.258]  We've made evening newscasts irrelevant.
[00:35:28.278 --> 00:35:30.119]  We've made CNN irrelevant.
[00:35:30.399 --> 00:35:35.203]  We've made Al Gore and his book and film and an Oscar and Nobel Prizes irrelevant.
[00:35:35.723 --> 00:35:42.106]  A majority of the human race isn't afraid of global warming according to the latest Gallup survey of 111 countries.
[00:35:42.427 --> 00:35:44.248]  They have failed spectacularly.
[00:35:44.468 --> 00:35:46.309]  They're going on an old paradigm.
[00:35:46.469 --> 00:35:51.511]  They're going on a paradigm that would have worked decades ago when they could have crushed dissent and they controlled.
[00:35:51.691 --> 00:35:54.853]  We only had three television stations and some major newspapers.
[00:35:55.253 --> 00:35:56.454]  But it doesn't work now.
[00:35:56.474 --> 00:35:56.974]  That's right.
[00:35:57.034 --> 00:35:57.635]  They're using old
[00:35:58.675 --> 00:36:02.058]  Cold War Soviet model crap, and we know that's where this all came from.
[00:36:02.418 --> 00:36:06.922]  It's like some weird vestigial leftover from that communist system, and it's failed.
[00:36:07.283 --> 00:36:09.745]  Mark Moreno, I have heard nothing but pure Veritas here.
[00:36:10.045 --> 00:36:13.608]  I think this is one of the best interviews I've ever done, and I'm honored to have you.
[00:36:13.869 --> 00:36:15.090]  ClimateDepot.com.
[00:36:15.310 --> 00:36:24.398]  When we defeat these anti-liberty traitors, you deserve a prize for this, and not a fake Nobel Prize, but a Congressional Medal of Honor against their tyranny.
[00:36:24.678 --> 00:36:25.399]  God bless you, sir.
[00:36:25.871 --> 00:36:26.412]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:36:26.472 --> 00:36:26.812]  Enjoy it.
[00:36:27.253 --> 00:36:27.674]  Amazing.
[00:36:27.914 --> 00:36:33.762]  Listen, these people want to shut off our industrial base, shut off our power systems, because they've all invested in China.
[00:36:33.982 --> 00:36:36.806]  They are enemies of every man, woman, and child.
[00:36:37.186 --> 00:36:41.532]  We're going to break, and we're coming back to talk to Wayne Madsen who went to Indonesia.
[00:36:42.293 --> 00:36:46.414]  Who is going to be giving us a report on the birth certificate issue.
[00:36:46.775 --> 00:36:47.695]  I was never a birther.
[00:36:48.115 --> 00:36:52.296]  But the fact is they're trying to shut down anybody that tries to investigate this.
[00:36:52.537 --> 00:36:53.237]  They're scared of it.
[00:36:53.297 --> 00:36:55.818]  It's turned out his social security numbers are fake.
[00:36:56.078 --> 00:36:58.199]  We're going to be covering that after this break.
[00:36:58.239 --> 00:36:58.759]  Stay with us.
[00:37:04.181 --> 00:37:05.581]  The American dream.
[00:37:06.922 --> 00:37:08.862]  There's a reason they call it a dream.
[00:37:09.462 --> 00:37:10.943]  Who's there?
[00:37:11.806 --> 00:37:13.288]  Cock-a-doodle-doo, pal.
[00:37:18.534 --> 00:37:20.396]  No, no, no, no, no!
[00:37:20.757 --> 00:37:21.938]  I don't have any more money!
[00:37:22.659 --> 00:37:24.001]  My job sucks right now!
[00:37:24.081 --> 00:37:24.682]  Please!
[00:37:24.742 --> 00:37:26.103]  I'll have more money next month!
[00:37:28.055 --> 00:37:29.596]  You can't take my house!
[00:37:29.936 --> 00:37:30.997]  Is that your signature?
[00:37:31.177 --> 00:37:33.818]  It is a private bank, owned by private stockholders.
[00:37:34.279 --> 00:37:35.519]  A private bank?
[00:37:35.659 --> 00:37:37.601]  Do not let the name Federal fool you.
[00:37:37.841 --> 00:37:44.845]  If I got this money from the bank, and the bank got it from the Federal Reserve Dump Tracks, where does the Federal Reserve get their money?
[00:37:56.889 --> 00:38:00.454]  They take our property away from us, just like Thomas Jefferson said they would.
[00:38:00.915 --> 00:38:02.877]  Those sons of bitches!
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:06.623]  It's the greatest theft in human history.
[00:38:36.297 --> 00:38:39.679]  Wow, that was one of the most powerful interviews I've ever done.
[00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:42.401]  That is Veritas with Mark Moreno.
[00:38:42.941 --> 00:38:46.204]  Now come up in a few minutes, we're going to be talking to Wayne Madsen with some breaking news.
[00:38:46.624 --> 00:38:47.685]  But first, look.
[00:38:48.746 --> 00:38:50.026]  I've not been a birther.
[00:38:50.627 --> 00:38:54.928]  Going back four years ago when Obama started campaigning, people said, hey, this guy's an American.
[00:38:55.388 --> 00:38:57.089]  I'm like, listen, he's a gun grabber.
[00:38:57.229 --> 00:38:57.909]  I'm against him.
[00:38:58.389 --> 00:38:59.709]  I don't want to get into where he's from.
[00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:11.273]  But over the years, sealing the high school records, the college records, the freaking out, the demonization, the earlier, three years ago, fake
[00:39:13.032 --> 00:39:13.272]  I don't
[00:39:31.994 --> 00:39:40.763]  online check the E-Verify that we've been done with employees here and it said listen this social security number is questionable fraud is involved.
[00:39:41.083 --> 00:39:44.967]  This guy can't even pass a basic business background check.
[00:39:45.227 --> 00:39:46.488]  He never lived in Connecticut.
[00:39:46.728 --> 00:39:50.272]  We know that's a fake social security number assigned to him.
[00:39:50.952 --> 00:39:56.057]  Why would the system want to put an illegal alien like his uncle who's about to get deported in power?
[00:39:56.818 --> 00:39:57.719]  Why would they want to do this?
[00:39:57.779 --> 00:39:59.440]  Because they can blackmail him.
[00:39:59.881 --> 00:40:01.682]  They've got him by the short hairs.
[00:40:02.242 --> 00:40:04.104]  That's what's going on here.
[00:40:04.164 --> 00:40:05.445]  It's very, very simple.
[00:40:05.825 --> 00:40:07.827]  Obama is a teleprompter reading puppet.
[00:40:08.287 --> 00:40:09.929]  I could care less, he's a distraction.
[00:40:10.549 --> 00:40:18.435]  But at the end of the day, he's a 21st century, latest model of a puppet, who is totally and completely compromised.
[00:40:22.859 --> 00:40:25.281]  Alright, you can full screen that so then I can come back to it.
[00:40:28.797 --> 00:40:33.340]  Massive new radioactivity possible if melted core hits the water.
[00:40:33.721 --> 00:40:37.123]  That's what Infowars.com has been reporting on, as well as Washington's blog.
[00:40:37.443 --> 00:40:38.744]  It's all over the Japanese news.
[00:40:39.164 --> 00:40:52.154]  It's been making Chernobyl look like child's play in the last six months, but now as water begins to pour in, it threatens a giant new explosion that will rain radiation down on the U.S.
[00:40:53.544 --> 00:40:58.829]  But that doesn't matter, because the EPA has already raised the level of radiation, saying any level is safe.
[00:40:59.430 --> 00:41:13.082]  With more on the plunging fortunes of the corporate frontman, Barack Obama, we're joined by Wayne Madsen, who's a Navy anti-submarine warfare expert, worked for the National Security Agency.
[00:41:14.003 --> 00:41:26.056]  RCA, he has reported from Capitol Hill for decades on national security issues and broken some of the biggest stories concerning illegal spying on the American people and other national security issues.
[00:41:26.116 --> 00:41:28.899]  Well, he's somebody who is more progressive.
[00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:36.322]  And it was certainly not attacking Barack Obama because he was some Republican with an axe to grind.
[00:41:36.842 --> 00:41:53.147]  But he has been to Chicago, he has been to Jakarta, Indonesia, he has been all over the world tracking the real identity and providence of Barack Hussein Obama, aka Barry Sotero, or back to aka Barack Obama.
[00:41:53.707 --> 00:41:57.569]  And we've now seen the reports that World Daily and others have run.
[00:41:58.089 --> 00:42:04.452]  E-Verify flags Obama's social security number out of Connecticut as probably fraudulent.
[00:42:04.932 --> 00:42:09.814]  It's been admitted that he did not live in Connecticut and should not have been issued one.
[00:42:09.834 --> 00:42:11.555]  We know his mother worked for the CIA.
[00:42:12.255 --> 00:42:18.177]  And Wayne Madsen has broken a lot of the research that others later pick up and sometimes misrepresent.
[00:42:18.437 --> 00:42:19.378]  So he joins us
[00:42:19.898 --> 00:42:25.860]  But talk about the incredible developments when he was in Indonesia where they tried to block him every step of the way.
[00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:28.941]  Same thing happened with Jerome Corsi in Kenya.
[00:42:29.081 --> 00:42:40.125]  And of course the Kenyan government has now released their national security letter when George W. Bush was sending letters trying to find out about the providence of Barack Obama and they wrote back to the White House and said,
[00:42:42.326 --> 00:42:45.829]  Whoever he is, it's been erased out of the records here.
[00:42:45.869 --> 00:42:47.590]  It's been destroyed, so there is a cover-up.
[00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:56.217]  So, cover-up, just like with Nixon and the Plumbers and Watergate, is the evidence of the crime 99% of the time.
[00:42:56.277 --> 00:42:57.678]  Truly a Manchurian candidate.
[00:42:58.019 --> 00:43:03.883]  Joining us from D.C., where he's back visiting, is Wayne Madsen, traveling the world.
[00:43:04.164 --> 00:43:08.027]  Wayne, let's start out with Obama and what you've discovered.
[00:43:09.955 --> 00:43:13.679]  Well, I spent almost a month in Jakarta, Indonesia.
[00:43:13.739 --> 00:43:19.104]  This is, of course, where Obama lived after his mother took him there in 1967.
[00:43:19.324 --> 00:43:22.227]  He was six years old.
[00:43:24.369 --> 00:43:30.395]  The minute I arrived in Jakarta, it was quite clear that I was being followed around.
[00:43:30.836 --> 00:43:33.739]  I had, for example, I had an interview scheduled with
[00:43:34.299 --> 00:43:36.000]  Obama's school teacher.
[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:42.383]  She's quite old now, but that interview was cancelled at, I mean, the very last minute.
[00:43:42.863 --> 00:43:49.106]  It was quite clear that the embassy was sending people around to dissuade people from talking to me.
[00:43:49.166 --> 00:43:57.250]  Now, I did manage to talk to quite a few people, even with that kind of pressure, but the U.S.
[00:43:57.310 --> 00:44:02.453]  Embassy in Jakarta is in total cover-up mode on behalf of
[00:44:03.053 --> 00:44:03.613]  Obama.
[00:44:04.934 --> 00:44:21.578]  We also know that he, on his mother's passport application to have her passport renewed, she listed Obama's name as Barack Obama, and then there was this name so barked
[00:44:22.279 --> 00:44:22.479]  Yeah.
[00:44:38.319 --> 00:44:42.721]  More than likely, the Indonesian name given to Barack Obama.
[00:44:42.801 --> 00:44:54.604]  So, the mere fact that it came to me from government sources in Indonesia, Indonesian government sources, that Mr. Obama never did get his U.S.
[00:44:54.644 --> 00:44:56.125]  citizenship back after his
[00:44:56.878 --> 00:45:23.504]  Legal guardian, Lolo Satoro, renounced it so he could attend two schools there and the law at the time, and I have a copy of the law in Indonesian, which I'm trying to get certifiably translated to English, specifically states, it's a 1958 law, you must be an Indonesian citizen to attend both the Menteng Elementary School, where he, that's the last school he went to, and before that the St.
[00:45:23.564 --> 00:45:24.404]  Franciscus
[00:45:25.104 --> 00:45:25.285]  Yeah, no.
[00:45:41.201 --> 00:45:48.488]  And Wayne, this is bombshell and I want you to elaborate on it, for those that don't know, because if you give up your U.S.
[00:45:48.988 --> 00:45:54.853]  citizenship to become an Indonesian citizen, you can't later then become a U.S.
[00:45:54.933 --> 00:45:55.454]  President.
[00:45:55.474 --> 00:45:57.396]  So I want you to comment on that.
[00:45:58.248 --> 00:46:01.090]  Right, and even if Obama did get his U.S.
[00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:10.975]  citizenship restored, that would change his status from natural-born to a native-born American citizen, and the Constitution is quite specific.
[00:46:11.475 --> 00:46:16.178]  Only a natural-born citizen can serve as President or Vice President of the United States.
[00:46:17.759 --> 00:46:25.303]  So with that broken citizenship, this kind of takes all the... this puts the focus really on the citizenship issue and
[00:46:26.141 --> 00:46:27.986]  Not the birth certificate.
[00:46:28.166 --> 00:46:29.710]  Let's say he was born in Hawaii.
[00:46:30.769 --> 00:46:37.532]  Even though he was born in Hawaii and was a natural-born citizen, the mere fact that he was an Indonesian citizen, U.S.
[00:46:37.572 --> 00:46:41.654]  citizenship renounced, and he may not have gotten his U.S.
[00:46:41.674 --> 00:46:49.178]  citizenship restored, if ever, legally, after the age of 18, he could have done it.
[00:46:49.298 --> 00:46:55.220]  I mean, you can't hold him responsible for the actions of his mother and his stepfather, but he had to declare
[00:46:58.026 --> 00:46:58.486]  His U.S.
[00:46:58.506 --> 00:47:01.388]  citizenship once again before he reached the age of 18.
[00:47:01.588 --> 00:47:12.896]  There's every indication that that was not done and I think that now puts the focus on who assigned him this fraudulent social security number from Connecticut.
[00:47:13.677 --> 00:47:18.220]  We know Wayne from day one he has this meteoric rise.
[00:47:19.001 --> 00:47:21.323]  Clearly CIA on both sides of the family.
[00:47:21.823 --> 00:47:24.065]  We've gone over all that in long interviews in the past.
[00:47:24.705 --> 00:47:42.544]  But now they've brought out the obviously fake new birth certificate, then they produced the Bin Laden rabbit out of a hat trick, but still he's got one of the lowest approval ratings, well the lowest ever recorded this far in, and plunging so fast
[00:47:43.344 --> 00:47:50.487]  What do you think the establishment's planning to do with Barack Obama, who they gave the Peace Prize to, where they did everything for?
[00:47:50.787 --> 00:47:59.091]  They were clearly planning on him being a messianic leader to sell us tyranny, but their precious creation has blown up in their face.
[00:47:59.111 --> 00:48:02.032]  So what comes next, and what else did you learn on your travels?
[00:48:03.547 --> 00:48:07.488]  Well, personally, I think Obama's going to get another four years.
[00:48:08.209 --> 00:48:18.072]  We know that these electronic voting machines are fixed, and so there are methods by which they can ensure that he's going to be re-elected.
[00:48:18.112 --> 00:48:24.434]  I mean, I would note that the polling here in Virginia shows him tied with the Republican candidate.
[00:48:25.154 --> 00:48:33.840]  Well, I mean, Virginia hadn't voted Democratic since 1964 for LBJ until it voted for Obama in 08.
[00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:45.388]  I can tell you that Obama is extremely unpopular here in Virginia, and I don't know how these polls are being conducted or who they're asking, but I think the fix is in.
[00:48:45.428 --> 00:48:49.211]  I think he's going to have another four years because they're very comfortable with this guy.
[00:48:49.691 --> 00:48:52.572]  He's doing everything that they want him to do.
[00:48:52.592 --> 00:49:11.836]  I would also note that when I was in Indonesia last year a movie was produced based on a book and I'm gonna hold it up here it's called Little Obama and this book and the movie was I discovered was funded by the United States government
[00:49:13.397 --> 00:49:24.082]  It was supposed to come out concurrent with Obama's first state visit to Indonesia, but he canceled two visits to Indonesia, so they had to release it without Obama present.
[00:49:24.522 --> 00:49:30.544]  But when the movie was first produced, it was screened by the U.S.
[00:49:30.604 --> 00:49:34.926]  ambassador and the embassy staff, the CIA's political officer at the U.S.
[00:49:34.966 --> 00:49:39.388]  Embassy in Jakarta, and they demanded that two scenes
[00:49:40.646 --> 00:49:43.029]  Yeah, so this guy is a complete
[00:50:02.829 --> 00:50:05.071]  Shadow government, CIA, cut out.
[00:50:05.471 --> 00:50:10.256]  And I agree with you, the establishment likes Obama because he'll take all the hatred and blame for them.
[00:50:10.877 --> 00:50:13.119]  And we're seeing a lot of cooked and manipulated polls.
[00:50:13.139 --> 00:50:16.602]  And when Ron Paul wins a poll, the Wall Street Journal won't even show his name.
[00:50:17.103 --> 00:50:18.524]  MSNBC's done the same thing.
[00:50:18.544 --> 00:50:21.126]  The entire system is afraid of Ron Paul.
[00:50:22.188 --> 00:50:34.441]  But expanding on that, the war he launched in Libya, where I know you visited, without Congressional approval, the super-Congress taking the power of the purse and handing it over to the President.
[00:50:35.002 --> 00:50:41.850]  We've got, fast and furious from your work in the government, NSA, Iran-Contra, all of it,
[00:50:42.350 --> 00:51:04.600]  Looking at Fast and Furious, tens of thousands of guns in New Mexico, we now learned drug gangs in Chicago, in Tampa, into Honduras, now it's come out in federal court, confirmed, El Paso Times, Chicago Tribune, with the federal document, that these drug kingpins that are getting busted are declaring, we work for ATF and CIA, and the government's coming in and saying it's true, release them.
[00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:10.343]  I mean, this is even bigger than Iran-Contra, and it just shows how criminal these people are.
[00:51:10.603 --> 00:51:12.425]  What's your view on Fast and Furious?
[00:51:14.446 --> 00:51:19.271]  Well, I think what we're seeing play out here is what we saw during the Bush administration.
[00:51:19.551 --> 00:51:22.894]  The implementation of the strategy of tension.
[00:51:24.895 --> 00:51:26.577]  These people do not want peace.
[00:51:27.357 --> 00:51:36.265]  Whether it's in the Middle East or in Mexico or Central America or anywhere, North Africa, they want war because they profit from war.
[00:51:36.545 --> 00:51:38.327]  The IMF and World Bank profit
[00:51:40.936 --> 00:51:41.296]  We're good to go.
[00:52:06.011 --> 00:52:11.252]  Well, he says he's having a good crisis and makes jokes about people starving.
[00:52:12.132 --> 00:52:14.373]  And he's anti-gun, anti-family.
[00:52:14.393 --> 00:52:17.093]  I mean, if there's something evil out there, he's behind it.
[00:52:17.693 --> 00:52:27.935]  And he's also bragging right now that, hey, you're going to have to give a total economic dictatorship to the banks that engineered the collapse of Europe, or we'll have a worldwide depression.
[00:52:28.475 --> 00:52:31.156]  I mean, it's so transparent what they're doing.
[00:52:32.677 --> 00:52:38.883]  Yeah, I mean, he supposedly controls things from the left, although he's not from the left.
[00:52:39.403 --> 00:52:44.107]  And Murdoch, Rupert Murdoch on the other side, he controls things over there.
[00:52:44.147 --> 00:52:57.139]  So what we have are these wealthy, super-billionaire elites running the show and plunging countries into war and economic disaster just by snapping their fingers.
[00:52:57.539 --> 00:52:58.640]  And creating the illusion.
[00:52:59.821 --> 00:53:02.862]  Creating the illusion of a choice between them.
[00:53:03.942 --> 00:53:10.304]  So you think Obama will get away with all the power grabs and then when some new president comes in after him, that'll just continue?
[00:53:11.064 --> 00:53:14.165]  I certainly hope you're wrong, Wayne, but this is disgusting.
[00:53:14.465 --> 00:53:22.447]  Shifting gears to Libya, I know you've been to Libya, I believe it's repeatedly, and somewhat recently, and they keep lying.
[00:53:22.707 --> 00:53:26.848]  First it was just loving rebels that were peaceful, now they admit it's Al Qaeda.
[00:53:27.791 --> 00:53:30.813]  Reuters is saying, oh God, Al-Qaeda is taking over Libya now.
[00:53:31.033 --> 00:53:32.474]  And it's like, but you put them in there.
[00:53:32.935 --> 00:53:34.536]  They keep saying Qaddafi's been defeated.
[00:53:34.596 --> 00:53:37.578]  Turns out more than half the country's still under his control.
[00:53:37.598 --> 00:53:42.661]  I mean, this is the first time that we've seen things become completely Orwellian.
[00:53:43.022 --> 00:53:50.527]  It's like NATO and our own government is run by Baghdad Bob, and everything is the opposite of what they say.
[00:53:52.338 --> 00:53:54.039]  Yeah, let me tell you what's next.
[00:53:54.499 --> 00:54:05.325]  Apparently there's been some secret protocols signed between the United States and the NATO countries that helped invade Libya, attacked Libya, to establish bases.
[00:54:05.606 --> 00:54:06.246]  You know, the U.S.
[00:54:06.326 --> 00:54:10.528]  used to have an Air Force base in Libya, Wheeles, it was a B-52 base.
[00:54:10.789 --> 00:54:12.289]  That's going, I mean, the U.S.
[00:54:12.329 --> 00:54:14.631]  is going to go back in there now with military bases.
[00:54:15.251 --> 00:54:22.261]  I understand that one military base is going to be located very close to the border with Sudan, which has already been broken up into two countries.
[00:54:22.321 --> 00:54:25.565]  South Sudan is basically a vassal state of the United States.
[00:54:25.585 --> 00:54:28.269]  So this is the Afrikan takeover beach hit?
[00:54:28.769 --> 00:54:32.595]  Yeah, and Algeria still supports
[00:54:33.355 --> 00:54:38.578]  Kadafi, rich in natural gas and some oil, but mostly natural gas.
[00:54:38.758 --> 00:54:49.224]  When Algeria basically said, look, we're not going to deal with these rebels, we detect that there's Al-Qaeda amongst them, people that we consider unsavory.
[00:54:49.544 --> 00:54:56.728]  There were two terrorist attacks in Algeria directed against Algerian security forces
[00:54:57.168 --> 00:54:58.289]  Blamed on Al-Qaeda.
[00:54:58.629 --> 00:55:08.176]  I would say the next two dominoes that are going to fall will be northern Sudan, what's left of the country of Sudan after it was broken in two, and Algeria.
[00:55:08.437 --> 00:55:10.038]  This isn't over by any stretch.
[00:55:10.338 --> 00:55:20.806]  We're probably going to see these sorrow-staged themed marches and revolutions now in Khartoum and Algiers.
[00:55:21.713 --> 00:55:38.512]  And like a dog returning to its vomit, it has the double goody of strategy of tension, wrecking the wealthiest economy, lifting up the rest of Africa, Libya, and then they can come right back in a few years or maybe even just a few months, they're already talking about it.
[00:55:39.053 --> 00:55:39.293]  We're good.
[00:56:09.793 --> 00:56:10.733]  Yeah, and it's blatant.
[00:56:10.793 --> 00:56:12.914]  It's totally blatant what they're doing here.
[00:56:13.034 --> 00:56:22.136]  I mean, Libya, as you said, was one of the, as far as social programs to help the people, one of the most advanced.
[00:56:22.156 --> 00:56:33.119]  Now we have something I reported after I was there the last time in May, that black Libyans and black guest workers from other countries in sub-Saharan Africa were being targeted.
[00:56:34.161 --> 00:56:36.962]  By the rebels, now we have the mainstream finally coming around.
[00:56:37.122 --> 00:56:53.767]  Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, all reporting that black Libyans and black African guest workers have been subjected to beheadings and other, the women raped, and other terrible human rights abuses.
[00:56:53.787 --> 00:57:00.909]  When I first reported that, the mainstream was, oh no, I even asked the United Nations Commissioner
[00:57:02.273 --> 00:57:04.334]  Well, Wayne, Walter Fauntroy, as you know, the former D.C.
[00:57:04.354 --> 00:57:04.995]  delegate to Congress,
[00:57:27.268 --> 00:57:31.229]  For folks that don't know, that's the equivalent of their congressperson, because they don't have congresspeople.
[00:57:31.609 --> 00:57:34.070]  He had to hide out for a month and was presumed dead.
[00:57:34.090 --> 00:57:34.810]  He finally got out.
[00:57:34.830 --> 00:57:39.091]  I know you know about this, but he said that he had to hide out because they were killing all blacks on site.
[00:57:39.391 --> 00:57:49.894]  That's now been confirmed, and that's one reason there's such a resistance to the Al Qaeda takeover in the country, is because they're not giving him quarter, and they're just dragging any blacks they find out, men, women, and children.
[00:57:50.874 --> 00:57:55.958]  There's giant dead piles of them all hacked up everywhere, and our media says, well, this is quite liberal and loving.
[00:57:56.319 --> 00:57:57.239]  Obama's doing it.
[00:57:57.499 --> 00:58:02.604]  So that's the black cover they needed, as we said in the Obama deception that breaks all this down.
[00:58:02.624 --> 00:58:05.066]  And we even show and say Libya will be invaded.
[00:58:05.826 --> 00:58:07.027]  Actually, Tarpley did in the film.
[00:58:07.087 --> 00:58:08.608]  It's incredible how he predicted that.
[00:58:08.989 --> 00:58:16.955]  But it's just amazing that as long as they say it's liberal, then you can do anything you want.
[00:58:17.035 --> 00:58:20.278]  It's just, it's beyond ridiculous at this point.
[00:58:21.676 --> 00:58:30.800]  Yeah, and Fauntroy also said he saw evidence that it was French and Danish commandos in Libya that carried out some of these atrocities, some of these beheadings.
[00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:33.241]  I also understand that U.S.
[00:58:33.521 --> 00:58:37.243]  Special Forces were in Libya and are in Libya today.
[00:58:37.303 --> 00:58:40.144]  Now here's how you know about the casualties.
[00:58:40.204 --> 00:58:43.706]  There were casualties sustained among these Americans.
[00:58:44.466 --> 00:58:48.430]  I've been told that they're being reported as U.S.
[00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:52.854]  service people being killed in training accidents in Europe and other places.
[00:58:52.874 --> 00:59:01.802]  No, that's how they always do it, but I've talked to the Army induction officer where the dead bodies come in for processing, and he said
[00:59:03.157 --> 00:59:06.379]  Four months ago, he'd already taken five in to his office.
[00:59:06.819 --> 00:59:09.100]  And then just last week, they went ahead and admitted U.S.
[00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:11.681]  Special Forces are on the ground, and they've always been there.
[00:59:11.701 --> 00:59:13.342]  So you've been proven right on that again.
[00:59:13.362 --> 00:59:15.283]  Wayne Madsen of WayneMadsenReport.com.
[00:59:15.664 --> 00:59:22.607]  In closing, as part of your globetrotting, your global surveying, you've also gone to Japan.
[00:59:22.627 --> 00:59:25.389]  And we know the EPA, months ago, said that
[00:59:26.329 --> 00:59:31.594]  Oh, well, we'll just raise the levels of radioactive isotopes 1,000 to 100,000 times what it previously was.
[00:59:31.914 --> 00:59:33.796]  We know milk and food all over the U.S.
[00:59:34.016 --> 00:59:40.361]  has had as high as 50 times safe levels of different isotopes, and now they're reporting.
[00:59:40.401 --> 00:59:41.702]  We've got some graphics we can show.
[00:59:42.603 --> 00:59:54.633]  From the news while you're talking, that as water pours in, it's continued Chernobyl's on top of Chernobyl's, and a lot of the Japanese government has now had to resign, admittedly lying about this.
[00:59:54.673 --> 01:00:00.638]  We just had a French nuclear weapons processing system with MOX fuel, plutonium blow up.
[01:00:01.199 --> 01:00:04.141]  I mean, we had a Canadian reactor have a big spill.
[01:00:05.422 --> 01:00:07.723]  I mean, something weird's going on here.
[01:00:07.743 --> 01:00:12.944]  It's almost like somebody's sabotaging things, or I guess it's that thing of when it rains, it pours.
[01:00:13.264 --> 01:00:15.384]  Wayne, what do you see going on here since you went to Japan?
[01:00:16.084 --> 01:00:24.826]  Well, one thing, I've been through Narita Airport in Tokyo many times, but I haven't been to downtown Tokyo since 1984, until this trip.
[01:00:25.526 --> 01:00:33.928]  And one thing that really shocked me was where we're, Tokyo used to be a bustling city, people everywhere, that my first
[01:00:34.608 --> 01:00:36.628]  My reaction was, where are all the people?
[01:00:36.789 --> 01:00:39.349]  There wasn't all the traffic that I remember.
[01:00:40.029 --> 01:00:46.671]  I mean, yes, they've done some stuff downtown to alleviate traffic, but I asked the question, where are all the people?
[01:00:47.391 --> 01:00:50.312]  I was told, look, many people have moved to southern Japan.
[01:00:50.392 --> 01:00:52.812]  Those who are able to get out have left.
[01:00:52.852 --> 01:00:59.554]  They've gone down to Kyushu Island, southern Honshu, and even into the Okinawa Islands.
[01:01:01.252 --> 01:01:02.613]  Well, that's a huge story.
[01:01:02.693 --> 01:01:14.362]  So there's a giant exodus, and I've seen some reports where they try to whitewash that, so the Japanese didn't believe their government day one, and it looks like they did the right thing getting out of there.
[01:01:16.624 --> 01:01:20.527]  Absolutely, and like I say, the lack of traffic, the lack of people.
[01:01:20.727 --> 01:01:28.353]  You know, you remember the Tokyo subway system was so packed that at rush hour they had to use these cattle prods to force people in?
[01:01:28.513 --> 01:01:28.794]  Yeah.
[01:01:29.014 --> 01:01:30.215]  You don't see that anymore.
[01:01:31.419 --> 01:01:34.902]  Because there's not the traffic in the subway system that there used to be.
[01:01:35.962 --> 01:01:42.367]  Well, we know there's massive radiation sickness and there have been deaths, and why didn't the government just tell the truth from the beginning?
[01:01:43.327 --> 01:01:51.173]  I mean, why does government have this compulsion in all eras, in all times, in all civilizations, to lie even when the truth would serve them?
[01:01:51.313 --> 01:01:54.415]  Because it just came out that they lied instead of responding.
[01:01:55.325 --> 01:02:00.988]  Well I think the same thing happened in Japan as what happened in the Gulf of Mexico.
[01:02:01.328 --> 01:02:04.669]  Obama allowed BP to run the show down there.
[01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:07.951]  BP was lying about the catastrophe there.
[01:02:08.311 --> 01:02:13.714]  These reactors, this is General Electric reactor technology.
[01:02:13.794 --> 01:02:15.975]  General Electric was calling the shots over there.
[01:02:16.015 --> 01:02:16.535]  They didn't want
[01:02:17.175 --> 01:02:20.877]  Uh, it out that, you know, these reactors are inherently unsafe.
[01:02:21.157 --> 01:02:24.399]  And who is Obama's, uh, chief of, uh, jobs?
[01:02:25.139 --> 01:02:27.301]  Uh, the jobs program, who's his good buddy?
[01:02:27.381 --> 01:02:30.762]  Jeffrey Immelt, the CEO of General Electric.
[01:02:30.782 --> 01:02:37.366]  Who, by the way, who, by the way, is moving the entire x-ray division of General Electric, uh, to China.
[01:02:37.906 --> 01:02:42.648]  Who, by the way, is advising, and, and even Dennis Kucinich came out and said, hey,
[01:02:44.031 --> 01:02:46.035]  How about you create some jobs here in America?
[01:02:46.276 --> 01:02:49.483]  I mean, these guys do anything they can to shut this country down.
[01:02:49.884 --> 01:02:51.948]  In closing, why do you think that's the case?
[01:02:52.964 --> 01:03:02.367]  Well, I think Obama and the people around him, Geithner and Bernanke at the Fed, and all these other people, what they've done is they've turned the U.S.
[01:03:02.407 --> 01:03:07.469]  government and many state governments into wholly owned subsidiaries of major corporations.
[01:03:07.829 --> 01:03:17.812]  And we are basically low-paid or no-paid employees of this oligarchy that has seized control over the United States.
[01:03:18.072 --> 01:03:30.335]  That's right, if you do happen to make money writing a book or starting a business, then they steal your money and give it in banker bailouts and corporate welfare to General Electric people and General Motors to move out of the country.
[01:03:30.735 --> 01:03:35.477]  These people make me sick, and that's something the Republicans will never tell their constituents.
[01:03:35.557 --> 01:03:39.238]  Limbaugh and all them sit up there and praise the Fortune 100, and the Fortune 100 to a company.
[01:03:41.098 --> 01:03:48.061]  are a bunch of anti-American, anti-free market, monopoly men, trash, and the enemy of every single free human on this planet.
[01:03:48.101 --> 01:03:53.743]  They are usurpers who have hijacked this country and finance Al Qaeda to menace us into submission.
[01:03:54.183 --> 01:03:56.464]  Wayne Madsen, it's always great talking to you.
[01:03:56.744 --> 01:03:58.144]  I'm glad you're back in the U.S.
[01:03:58.685 --> 01:04:01.066]  and I look forward to speaking to you in the future.
[01:04:01.586 --> 01:04:07.288]  Anything else on Japan or Obama or any other tidbit that you'd like to, in closing, have the final word on?
[01:04:08.517 --> 01:04:20.559]  I would just say that next year, the Obama movie that was released in Japan, Young Obama, is going to be released here in the United States.
[01:04:20.679 --> 01:04:22.560]  United Artists bought the rights.
[01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:24.080]  It's going to be released.
[01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:26.181]  It's going to be that version that the U.S.
[01:04:26.261 --> 01:04:34.982]  Embassy and the ambassador, a guy named Cameron Hume, who is no longer there, but he was the ambassador at the time, wanted to have these two scenes removed from the movie.
[01:04:35.002 --> 01:04:37.923]  It's going to be released here in the United States for the election campaign.
[01:04:39.830 --> 01:04:44.312]  Along with that other movie they're producing about how Obama killed Osama.
[01:04:45.372 --> 01:04:46.033]  Or had him killed.
[01:04:46.393 --> 01:04:50.574]  And by the way, they admit the government's involved financing that with the great Hurt Locker people.
[01:04:51.035 --> 01:04:59.478]  And of course they're going to force feed the Obama Jesus child to the children in school like Al Gore's stupid video.
[01:04:59.778 --> 01:05:01.659]  Wayne Madsen, great having you on with us.
[01:05:01.719 --> 01:05:03.040]  WayneMadsenReport.com.
[01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:04.920]  Look forward to speaking to you very, very soon.
[01:05:05.621 --> 01:05:06.221]  You bet, Alex.
[01:05:07.150 --> 01:05:09.411]  All right, there goes Wayne Madsen, my friends.
[01:05:09.852 --> 01:05:12.813]  Well, that's it for InfoWars Nightly News.
