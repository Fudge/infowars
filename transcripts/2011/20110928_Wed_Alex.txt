[00:00:04.977 --> 00:00:09.821]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.821 --> 00:00:11.402]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.402 --> 00:00:12.963]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.963 --> 00:00:17.167]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.167 --> 00:00:21.210]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.183]  It is Wednesday, the 28th day of September 2011.
[00:00:31.183 --> 00:00:33.485]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:33.485 --> 00:00:37.429]  We're going to be here for the next three hours live.
[00:00:37.429 --> 00:00:44.254]  Well, coming up later in the hour, I want to get into the amazing ABC News headline.
[00:00:44.254 --> 00:00:49.979]  Al-Syieda, or Al-Qaeda, came out yesterday and told Ahmadinejad
[00:00:51.502 --> 00:00:58.857]  Denijad, that the leader of Iran, that how dare you say the buildings look like they were controlled demolition.
[00:00:58.857 --> 00:00:59.358]  We did it!
[00:01:00.717 --> 00:01:03.358]  And of course, it's a message board.
[00:01:03.358 --> 00:01:15.382]  And then you've got, what, four of the five Al-Qaeda top men, all born in the U.S., publicly, secretly meeting at the Pentagon, and being caught running the attacks.
[00:01:15.382 --> 00:01:19.983]  Running the latest major Hassan attack, the underwear bombing, and more.
[00:01:19.983 --> 00:01:22.784]  I mean, it is so incredibly transparent.
[00:01:22.784 --> 00:01:28.946]  All of this propaganda targets people that are just basically halfway paying attention.
[00:01:30.165 --> 00:01:32.786]  That's what's happening here.
[00:01:32.786 --> 00:01:36.007]  And so we're going to be going over that today.
[00:01:36.007 --> 00:01:45.551]  Speaking of Al-Qaeda being Western-run, nightmare in Libya, thousands of surface-to-air missiles unaccounted for.
[00:01:45.551 --> 00:01:47.772]  We've got that report.
[00:01:47.772 --> 00:01:50.573]  Of course, that came out a few weeks ago, but now it's back in the news.
[00:01:50.573 --> 00:01:54.234]  Now it's thousands, including some heat-seekers.
[00:01:54.234 --> 00:01:56.255]  And don't worry though, Al-Qaeda leader
[00:01:57.452 --> 00:02:18.838]  Abdul bin Haj, we've been talking about this the last few months, he's now writing columns, Mr. Belhaj is writing columns for the London Guardian and we're told that the West is now running drone attacks out of air bases in Libya and other areas to fight Al Qaeda in North Africa.
[00:02:18.838 --> 00:02:23.599]  So in reality they put Al Qaeda in, but that's okay because they're fighting Al Qaeda.
[00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:31.700]  I mean, this is the incredible propaganda that we are basically force-fed.
[00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.740]  Here's another one on London Independent.
[00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:39.301]  British soldiers in Afghanistan are shown snuff movies.
[00:02:39.301 --> 00:02:42.322]  They're called Kill Nights.
[00:02:42.322 --> 00:02:45.263]  Meanwhile, the troops are over there to grow the opium.
[00:02:45.263 --> 00:02:46.263]  And you know what's funny?
[00:02:46.263 --> 00:02:49.223]  That's just public information now.
[00:02:49.223 --> 00:02:52.164]  It's like, okay, the government, British government, the U.S.
[00:02:52.164 --> 00:02:53.284]  government, they're involved.
[00:02:55.075 --> 00:02:59.538]  In the harvesting and the production of all of this.
[00:02:59.538 --> 00:03:02.840]  And here is the ABC News headline.
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.261]  Al-Qaeda to Iran.
[00:03:04.261 --> 00:03:11.586]  Stop spreading 9-11 conspiracy theories.
[00:03:11.586 --> 00:03:15.108]  And it's always the usual suspects that put out these type of statements.
[00:03:15.108 --> 00:03:19.211]  Adam Gadahn.
[00:03:19.211 --> 00:03:23.033]  Real name Adam Perlman, grandson of the head of the ADL.
[00:03:23.033 --> 00:03:24.074]  Former head of the ADL.
[00:03:25.165 --> 00:03:28.527]  Who was arrested beating up Muslims outside mosque.
[00:03:28.527 --> 00:03:31.189]  He hated him so much.
[00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:39.093]  Now he puts announcements out that coincide with the Pentagon Military Industrial Complex agenda.
[00:03:39.093 --> 00:03:39.533]  What was it?
[00:03:39.533 --> 00:03:41.695]  Four years ago?
[00:03:41.695 --> 00:03:43.015]  Wire Magazine reported that
[00:03:44.107 --> 00:03:58.010]  They had their big tech expert look at the video uploads of Adam Gadon and others, and the Al Qaeda logo was in the same logo as the Pentagon connected groups putting the videos out.
[00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.711]  But that's not enough evidence for you.
[00:04:01.711 --> 00:04:08.413]  We again have Ammar al-Awlaki and others meeting secretly at the Pentagon getting their marching orders.
[00:04:09.485 --> 00:04:10.846]  That's now come out in the last year.
[00:04:10.846 --> 00:04:11.746]  We've talked a lot about it.
[00:04:11.746 --> 00:04:21.389]  And so, different organizations wanted to do a FOIA request and find out his State Department sanctioned record.
[00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.210]  State Department support.
[00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.612]  And of course, national security was declared on that.
[00:04:27.612 --> 00:04:28.212]  And they don't care.
[00:04:28.212 --> 00:04:29.172]  They even still have a lock.
[00:04:29.172 --> 00:04:30.413]  He put out a little announcement.
[00:04:30.413 --> 00:04:32.213]  Always backing the police.
[00:04:32.213 --> 00:04:34.694]  They're always backing new wars.
[00:04:34.694 --> 00:04:37.055]  This is full-spectrum dominance where the globalists
[00:04:38.772 --> 00:04:50.602]  Move their fake Al-Qaeda chess pieces around wherever they want, as a pretext to invade that country, and with great disdain at the same time, openly give real Al-Qaeda control of Libya.
[00:04:50.602 --> 00:04:59.049]  That's their disdain, while saying Iran is Al-Qaeda, but separately having Al-Cieda then criticize Iran, when Iran doesn't play along with the fable.
[00:05:04.467 --> 00:05:05.727]  Tyranny is here.
[00:05:05.727 --> 00:05:09.668]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:05:09.668 --> 00:05:11.889]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:17.311]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:05:17.751 --> 00:05:24.440]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:30.427]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:05:30.427 --> 00:05:34.092]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:05:34.572 --> 00:05:38.876]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:05:38.876 --> 00:05:44.820]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.383]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:05:48.383 --> 00:05:50.344]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:05:50.344 --> 00:05:51.485]  It's here.

[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:07.223]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:06:07.223 --> 00:06:12.366]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:06:12.366 --> 00:06:21.091]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:06:21.091 --> 00:06:25.153]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:06:25.153 --> 00:06:27.114]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:06:29.448 --> 00:06:34.169]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:38.010]  Blue Diamond Gussets, got it.
[00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:39.230]  Others don't.
[00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:41.371]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:06:41.371 --> 00:06:43.171]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:06:43.171 --> 00:06:46.052]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:06:46.052 --> 00:06:52.673]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.

[00:06:55.374 --> 00:06:57.755]  Diamond Gusset Jeans, got it.
[00:06:57.755 --> 00:06:58.235]  Others don't.
[00:06:59.881 --> 00:07:02.390]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck with an urgent update from...
[00:07:06.915 --> 00:07:15.998]  eFoods Direct has been doing all we can this year to help you get food before the perfect storm of exploding food prices from the 2011 harvest.
[00:07:15.998 --> 00:07:20.819]  During September, eFoods is giving you free shipping on your food supply orders.
[00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:24.940]  But you have to understand, we're entering the eye of the food cost storm.
[00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:31.822]  Ethanol is boosting gas prices and driving corn costs so high our wheat for bread is going into animal feed.
[00:07:32.222 --> 00:07:35.303]  And pasta wheat cost has doubled since last year.
[00:07:35.303 --> 00:07:40.464]  I strongly advise you to get your order in before the free shipping deadline, September 30th.
[00:07:40.464 --> 00:07:44.485]  Free shipping, including Alaska and Hawaii, ends September 30th.

[00:08:05.134 --> 00:08:09.979]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:08:09.979 --> 00:08:11.561]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.561 --> 00:08:13.103]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.103 --> 00:08:17.307]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.307 --> 00:08:21.352]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:23.902 --> 00:08:24.702]  We are live.
[00:08:24.702 --> 00:08:27.944]  It is Wednesday, the 28th day of September 2011.
[00:08:27.944 --> 00:08:32.527]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:08:32.527 --> 00:08:47.694]  Joining us in the first 20 minutes or so of the next hour, Wayne Madsen, formerly with the National Security Agency, always giving us great intel, is going to join us to talk about the latest on Iran, saying that they're going to send warships off the U.S.
[00:08:47.694 --> 00:08:48.295]  coast.
[00:08:48.295 --> 00:08:51.356]  Very bad move.
[00:08:51.356 --> 00:08:52.237]  What does this signal?
[00:08:54.249 --> 00:08:58.931]  No matter what quote side you're on, I'm neutral in all of this baloney.
[00:08:58.931 --> 00:09:00.652]  This is not a good thing.
[00:09:00.652 --> 00:09:05.034]  Also, we can talk about the fact that alternative media reported years ago.
[00:09:05.034 --> 00:09:07.075]  I went and looked it up.
[00:09:07.075 --> 00:09:16.759]  Prison Planet, two years ago, reported on Facebook tracking everywhere you go after you leave Facebook, even when you log out, and selling the data to corporations and government.
[00:09:17.961 --> 00:09:21.203]  Google does that, they all do it.
[00:09:21.203 --> 00:09:26.468]  All the big ones are government-funded, financed, positioned behemoths.
[00:09:27.856 --> 00:09:43.361]  And so Wayne Madsen, really breaking that down, I noticed that Facebook, after Infowars.com and Natural News and others in the last few days wrote articles about Facebook admitting that, okay, they do track you everywhere you go, even after you log out of Facebook.
[00:09:43.361 --> 00:09:47.382]  They've now apologized and say they're gonna stop.
[00:09:47.382 --> 00:09:54.524]  Just like the founder of Facebook called you dumb bleepers last year when it first started to come out.
[00:09:56.243 --> 00:10:02.125]  TomTom, two years ago, got caught selling your data and tracking you, the GPS company, and said they stopped.
[00:10:02.125 --> 00:10:06.066]  They were in the news again yesterday, caught again, and they said, don't worry, we'll stop.
[00:10:06.066 --> 00:10:10.888]  This is a psychological warfare operation.
[00:10:10.888 --> 00:10:14.909]  Look, look, there's a going for broke hoax happening.
[00:10:14.909 --> 00:10:24.512]  All over the country, they go on the news in the week before school and say, it's the law, go to this sports stadium and get your free shots.
[00:10:26.564 --> 00:10:30.166]  There is no law.
[00:10:30.166 --> 00:10:37.231]  Twelve years ago, the federal government signed secret deals made public last year to take all the death benefits of all U.S.
[00:10:37.231 --> 00:10:43.915]  military personnel from World War II through to today.
[00:10:43.915 --> 00:10:48.618]  The government now admits that they're growing the opium in Afghanistan.
[00:10:48.618 --> 00:10:51.440]  It has now been confirmed in two federal courts
[00:10:52.657 --> 00:10:56.118]  They've had district attorneys go public on the Texas-Mexico border.
[00:10:56.118 --> 00:11:01.800]  Sheriffs have gone public on this show years ago, but in the news this week.
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.641]  That indeed, the U.S.
[00:11:03.641 --> 00:11:10.943]  government allows select drug cartels to bring in unlimited tonnage of cocaine, heroin, and marijuana.
[00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:14.541]  Namely, Sinaloa.
[00:11:14.541 --> 00:11:18.443]  And that Sinaloa is then given firearms.
[00:11:18.443 --> 00:11:25.206]  They don't allow guns to be sold out of shops to drug cartels and order the shops to do it.
[00:11:25.206 --> 00:11:28.588]  They, it just came out, confirming what we already knew,
[00:11:29.788 --> 00:11:43.033]  In one shop alone were ordered to basically sell at rock bottom prices paid for with taxpayer money to the Sinaloa Cartel 2000 firearms out of one shop alone.
[00:11:43.033 --> 00:11:45.334]  That came out two days ago.
[00:11:45.334 --> 00:11:46.714]  We've covered it.
[00:11:46.714 --> 00:11:48.855]  But I mean, think about what this means.
[00:11:48.855 --> 00:11:51.636]  This morning, last night, this morning, today,
[00:11:52.992 --> 00:12:13.131]  I thought about just dropping everything for about a week, not doing the nightly news or having Aaron do it or others do it, not doing the radio show and just chronicling, digging through all of our massive research and assembling thousands of pieces of bedrock government corruption.
[00:12:13.936 --> 00:12:36.406]  Where it's absolutely admitted that they nerve-gassed and killed our own troops in Tashkent, or shot up little kids with syphilis, or fed pesticide to CPS-grabbed kids just a few years ago, or are growing the opium in Afghanistan, or the CIA caught shipping cocaine in hundreds and hundreds of times, and guns into Mexico.
[00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:45.155]  And DynCorp and Halliburton and the Pentagon and the UN caught running giant child kidnapping rings.
[00:12:45.155 --> 00:12:51.659]  Man, I mentioned that yesterday, DynCorp child trafficking, and it was Chicago Tribune, BBC.
[00:12:51.659 --> 00:12:52.959]  You also see our articles there.
[00:12:52.959 --> 00:12:56.962]  But the point is, it just hits me every moment.
[00:12:58.757 --> 00:13:07.846]  That it's so overwhelming, it's so ridiculous how over-the-top the corruption is, and how naive we are.
[00:13:07.846 --> 00:13:19.197]  You know, I talk to repair people that come to my house, I talk to people on the street, and I get a lot of feedback, and I talk to people who've never heard of my show.
[00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:34.195]  And if you talk to somebody who is awake, they won't shut up, you know, telling you about things because they care, they're informed, wow, they know what's happening in the world and they want to stop it because they want to live in a better society and they understand history.
[00:13:34.195 --> 00:13:47.499]  But when you talk to people that aren't aware, they don't know about secret spying, they don't know about bio-warfare soft kill operations, they don't know what sodium fluoride's doing to them, admit it, fact,
[00:13:50.034 --> 00:13:58.016]  Almost every EPA scientist themselves multiple times for over a decade has signed petitions and said, please take it out of the water.
[00:13:58.016 --> 00:14:02.957]  It increases cancer and they give all the evidence for it.
[00:14:02.957 --> 00:14:08.378]  Plug my earpiece here.
[00:14:08.378 --> 00:14:15.900]  I mean, more and more when I sit here and I go over all the news and all the information, even before I go on air, it's just,
[00:14:19.352 --> 00:14:24.593]  It's mainly that the general public is in a trance.
[00:14:24.593 --> 00:14:25.573]  And you talk to them.
[00:14:25.573 --> 00:14:41.137]  I mean, I remember 12 years ago or so, documenting that OnStar was listening to you all the time with NSA computers, nonstop transcribing everything you say and do in your car.
[00:14:47.893 --> 00:14:59.281]  And I went on air and I reported it and I got attacked and called a kook, even though I had the documentation.
[00:14:59.281 --> 00:15:07.647]  And then this morning I'm listening to local talk radio, you know, the big talk station, and I hear the talk show host
[00:15:09.224 --> 00:15:26.719]  With the co-host reading out of the news that, okay, wow, OnStar actually listens to you with the microphone built into the cell phone, the dash, even when you turn it off and they sell it all to government insurance companies and they're tracking everything you do and everywhere you go and putting it into databases.
[00:15:26.719 --> 00:15:28.760]  And the other host said, well, I don't have a problem with that.
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:30.222]  I think that's good.
[00:15:30.222 --> 00:15:31.303]  They want to take care of us.
[00:15:32.383 --> 00:15:34.004]  And he wasn't being sarcastic.
[00:15:34.004 --> 00:15:34.965]  The other host said, really?
[00:15:34.965 --> 00:15:36.326]  And he goes, yeah.
[00:15:36.326 --> 00:15:39.908]  Everybody should have to have these in their cars.
[00:15:39.908 --> 00:15:44.992]  Well, actually, the federal government's come out for more than a decade and said that that's their plan.
[00:15:44.992 --> 00:15:47.093]  See, here's the problem with doing this show.
[00:15:47.093 --> 00:15:57.080]  Just while I was sitting there talking, I remembered a month ago, Epoch Times reported on it, but it was also in other publications, in fact, try to pull this up, that Chinese
[00:15:59.011 --> 00:16:03.366]  Chinese government putting tracker systems in cars.
[00:16:04.232 --> 00:16:26.228]  And they call it a toll road system that you have to have in your car for many of the roads being toll roads, but the tech publications have analyzed it and found that it's actually a wireless tracker beacon and has a wireless audio sensor in it and that they are listening to people in their cars.
[00:16:26.228 --> 00:16:29.450]  It's basically an OnStar chip, a little cell phone transmitter.
[00:16:32.984 --> 00:16:41.187]  And it's like, oh my gosh, the Communist Chinese, aren't they incredibly draconian?
[00:16:41.187 --> 00:16:46.369]  So my point is, we are not in Kansas anymore.
[00:16:46.369 --> 00:16:47.169]  I say that a lot.
[00:16:47.169 --> 00:16:53.992]  I mean, you don't need some loudmouth, obnoxious Texan up here to tell you all of this.
[00:16:53.992 --> 00:16:59.234]  But then it begs the question, why isn't more being done about this?
[00:16:59.234 --> 00:17:02.255]  Why aren't more of you angry and upset and involved?
[00:17:04.878 --> 00:17:23.143]  In the final equation, I don't like having a scientific dictatorship built over me by a bunch of control freaks who fall over one another to write books and publications calling for the reduction of the human population of 80% or more.
[00:17:23.143 --> 00:17:30.665]  They start at 80% and then have big debates and we've written countless articles on it and showed you their documents and made the film Endgame.
[00:17:32.728 --> 00:17:39.694]  Where, you know, they put out articles defending Dr. Pianka at UT that says 90% need to be killed.
[00:17:39.694 --> 00:17:46.139]  And sooner rather than later with the airborne Ebola.
[00:17:46.139 --> 00:17:50.903]  And I had his graduate students send me threatening emails and I went and looked them up.
[00:17:50.903 --> 00:17:54.046]  These were doctors and chemists and biologists.
[00:17:54.046 --> 00:17:56.108]  A couple of them working in bioweapons facilities.
[00:17:58.815 --> 00:18:00.836]  And it was like, you know, he's a very great man.
[00:18:00.836 --> 00:18:04.699]  And by the way, you ought to be glad that he's so liberal.
[00:18:04.699 --> 00:18:13.904]  Most of us believe humans are a disease and it will be a sheer pleasure to kill the final human.
[00:18:13.904 --> 00:18:18.767]  And then I'm the bad guy for being against this.
[00:18:18.767 --> 00:18:24.151]  They have troops growing opium on ABC News, BBC and Fox telling us it's good.
[00:18:25.578 --> 00:18:32.964]  Every major vaccine manufacturer, when they study the vaccine, it's designed to do the opposite of what you're told.
[00:18:32.964 --> 00:18:40.149]  The Gardasil, clearly, and Dr. Tenpenny agrees, is a autoimmune disorder weapon.
[00:18:43.311 --> 00:18:48.898]  These other vaccines, you look at them, they're filled, chopped, chopped filled with cancer viruses.
[00:18:48.898 --> 00:18:50.399]  So is the Gardasil.
[00:18:50.399 --> 00:18:51.200]  It's hidden in plain view.
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:54.064]  It turns out, oh wow, this isn't really attenuated.
[00:18:54.064 --> 00:18:57.007]  This isn't just the protein of the RNA of the virus.
[00:18:57.007 --> 00:19:03.194]  It's a full RNA shell combined with the aluminum, so it's going to bind with your DNA.
[00:19:04.656 --> 00:19:07.078]  I mean, it's hidden in plain view.
[00:19:07.078 --> 00:19:08.639]  It's a bio weapon.
[00:19:08.639 --> 00:19:11.881]  And of course it's screwing women up and screwing young girls up.
[00:19:11.881 --> 00:19:15.183]  And there's all these thousands and thousands of horror stories.
[00:19:15.183 --> 00:19:23.269]  And right at 24% of all vaccine adverse reactions reported to the federal system are Gardasil.
[00:19:23.269 --> 00:19:27.632]  By the way, on average, 2% report adverse reactions.
[00:19:27.632 --> 00:19:31.375]  So if it's 18, well now it's 20 plus thousand, I was corrected.
[00:19:31.375 --> 00:19:33.616]  If it's 22,000 and growing, and that's 2%,
[00:19:35.882 --> 00:19:37.463]  Holy mackerel.
[00:19:37.463 --> 00:19:38.764]  And again, I haven't even gotten the news.
[00:19:38.764 --> 00:19:40.605]  You know, I'll just read you some headlines when we come back.
[00:19:40.605 --> 00:19:43.847]  It just, at a certain point, what is the point?
[00:19:43.847 --> 00:19:46.929]  Like trying to convince people, hey, man, the government's out of control.
[00:19:46.929 --> 00:19:48.310]  It really is.
[00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:50.632]  Don't you want to be free?
[00:19:50.632 --> 00:19:54.854]  It's so creepy to have these killers over us.
[00:19:54.854 --> 00:19:56.476]  And it's so obvious what they're doing.
[00:19:56.476 --> 00:19:58.357]  It should be easy to bring them down.
[00:20:00.518 --> 00:20:03.020]  Big Berkey Water Filters are in high demand.

[00:21:29.352 --> 00:21:30.593]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:30.593 --> 00:21:35.136]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:21:35.136 --> 00:21:40.960]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold before your retirement.

[00:22:01.373 --> 00:22:03.534]  They're spraying the air with heavy metals.
[00:22:03.534 --> 00:22:06.176]  Why and what can you do to defend your family?

[00:23:31.411 --> 00:23:32.232]  Thanks for watching.
[00:24:05.481 --> 00:24:07.862]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:24:07.862 --> 00:24:10.663]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:10.663 --> 00:24:16.966]  Alright, let me start getting into the news.
[00:24:16.966 --> 00:24:23.148]  Later I'm going to open the phones up as well.
[00:24:23.148 --> 00:24:33.513]  It's just, it's crazy to be informed and then see other people that have no idea about the three branches of government or how their state legislature works.
[00:24:34.904 --> 00:24:37.085]  And I'm horrified by that.
[00:24:37.085 --> 00:24:42.048]  You know, the danger of how they can then be manipulated by the system.
[00:24:42.048 --> 00:24:50.013]  But people that join the corrupt system, they love the fact that the public is so gullible and dumbed down and that tricks work on them.
[00:24:52.352 --> 00:24:54.534]  And I mean, I got children.
[00:24:54.534 --> 00:25:00.339]  Even if I was an evil person, I wouldn't want them to grow up in a world run by corruption and lies.
[00:25:00.339 --> 00:25:06.043]  And I'm not saying there's some utopian thing that's possible, but we certainly can strive towards something better.
[00:25:06.043 --> 00:25:07.465]  We know that.
[00:25:07.465 --> 00:25:12.609]  We know if we just give up on all standards, things degenerate.
[00:25:12.609 --> 00:25:13.650]  And it freaks me out.
[00:25:14.738 --> 00:25:20.540]  That they actually put real Al-Qaeda in charge, by name, with people bragging that they've killed U.S.
[00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:34.385]  soldiers in Iraq, in control of Libya, and then lecture us about how Al-Qaeda is going to attack America so I've got to have the TSA grab my genitals.
[00:25:34.385 --> 00:25:41.848]  And then you've got all these federal memos where they admit they use the threat of terror as a right to federalize everything, as a pretext to take our freedom.
[00:25:41.848 --> 00:25:42.668]  I mean, it's admitted!
[00:25:43.527 --> 00:25:47.948]  The former head of Homeland Security, Governor Ridge, admitted.
[00:25:47.948 --> 00:25:49.908]  Tom Ridge admitted it was all fake.
[00:25:49.908 --> 00:25:51.809]  That they issued fake terror alerts.
[00:25:51.809 --> 00:25:58.590]  And it's weird that it's almost like the more corrupt it gets, the more some people just buy into it.
[00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:02.711]  Because, well, it's the establishment doing it.
[00:26:02.711 --> 00:26:08.692]  Now, Congress does have the lowest approval rating ever, and there's all the big polls out that people, the vast majority, think the government's not
[00:26:09.482 --> 00:26:15.146]  You know, in their best interest in mainstream media, is losing more and more credibility and viewers.
[00:26:15.146 --> 00:26:18.948]  I mean, those numbers come out every day.
[00:26:18.948 --> 00:26:22.550]  So I should be positive, but it's not enough.
[00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:26.973]  It's not enough to just not believe these people or not like them.
[00:26:26.973 --> 00:26:33.578]  They know you're awake, and so they're going to wreck everything and bring in a hardcore tyranny to suppress us.
[00:26:34.636 --> 00:26:38.337]  This isn't like we're just gonna figure out their evil and everything goes away.
[00:26:38.337 --> 00:26:44.860]  It's at the point you figure out their evil that they really show their teeth.
[00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:57.105]  I mean, I saw this, I don't know, two weeks ago, it was reported that a bunch of service-to-air heat-seeking missiles, the type that one guy can operate, you pull up on a highway outside an airport,
[00:26:58.169 --> 00:27:01.310]  These things, a lot of them, I was reading, can go up 10,000, 15,000 feet.
[00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:03.690]  A plane takes off.
[00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:05.530]  It has no way to avoid it.
[00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:08.751]  It's at 2,000, 3,000 feet, flying over a neighborhood.
[00:27:08.751 --> 00:27:09.911]  The guy fires it.
[00:27:09.911 --> 00:27:10.411]  Boom!
[00:27:10.411 --> 00:27:13.612]  Aircraft goes down.
[00:27:13.612 --> 00:27:15.412]  And the feds will love that.
[00:27:15.412 --> 00:27:23.434]  You see, in old-time systems, and even just 50 years ago, if an agency screwed up and let something happen, they wouldn't get more power.
[00:27:23.434 --> 00:27:24.434]  They would get in trouble.
[00:27:25.353 --> 00:27:27.954]  People would get fired or go to jail.
[00:27:27.954 --> 00:27:30.175]  Now you get promoted.
[00:27:30.175 --> 00:27:31.555]  This is exactly what they want.
[00:27:31.555 --> 00:27:32.355]  And so here it is.
[00:27:32.355 --> 00:27:34.236]  It's confirmed.
[00:27:34.236 --> 00:27:37.677]  Thousands of missiles are missing in Libya.
[00:27:37.677 --> 00:27:49.021]  Now, remember, it was in the Washington Post last Friday that they're using drone bases in Libya and surrounding areas to, quote, fight al Qaeda in the region.
[00:27:52.554 --> 00:28:09.839]  Because they know the average person reading that doesn't put two and two together and go, but wait, they admit they put Al-Qaeda in power and the groups fighting the Libyan rebels are the opposite of Al-Qaeda, not saying they're really good either.
[00:28:09.839 --> 00:28:20.903]  But it's just like when Bush said Iran is with Al-Qaeda and Ahmadinejad is with Al-Qaeda and the dictator, because they've had fake elections of
[00:28:24.531 --> 00:28:28.514]  of Afghanistan, Mohammed Karzai says, sir, they're not with Al-Qaeda.
[00:28:28.514 --> 00:28:31.436]  Because he knew all over the Arab and Muslim world that was ridiculous.
[00:28:31.436 --> 00:28:35.518]  It was like saying, you know, Bill Clinton is Chinese or something.
[00:28:35.518 --> 00:28:40.341]  It's just absolutely ridiculous.
[00:28:40.341 --> 00:28:43.143]  But they're talking to an American audience.
[00:28:43.143 --> 00:28:51.068]  And I remember hearing Bloomberg Radio a few weeks ago, and they were laughing, going, Americans don't even hold passports on average, or know where Europe is.
[00:28:51.068 --> 00:28:52.029]  They'll never understand.
[00:28:52.029 --> 00:28:52.709]  They're being screwed.
[00:28:52.709 --> 00:28:53.570]  And they were giggling.
[00:28:54.383 --> 00:28:55.924]  But it's true.
[00:28:55.924 --> 00:28:58.667]  I wouldn't laugh about it unless it was sardonically in a sad way.
[00:28:58.667 --> 00:29:08.415]  You know, I guess in a satirical sick laugh, and I do that sometimes, but this was a celebratory laugh.
[00:29:08.415 --> 00:29:10.576]  Haha, the American people are idiots.
[00:29:10.576 --> 00:29:15.640]  And here was the investor class getting off on that.
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:18.423]  You know, when you pull down society, it pulls you down as well.
[00:29:19.875 --> 00:29:21.236]  You end up getting carjacked.
[00:29:21.236 --> 00:29:22.556]  You end up getting robbed.
[00:29:22.556 --> 00:29:25.217]  Your daughter ends up marrying trash.
[00:29:25.217 --> 00:29:27.558]  You don't get away with all this stuff.
[00:29:27.558 --> 00:29:29.519]  And, alright.
[00:29:29.519 --> 00:29:30.820]  Here it is, ABC News.
[00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:31.660]  Nightmare in Libya.
[00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:34.941]  Thousands of service-to-air missiles unaccounted for.
[00:29:34.941 --> 00:29:39.443]  And now they're going to have to have checkpoints everywhere because Al-Qaeda is going to attack us.
[00:29:39.443 --> 00:29:41.324]  But nobody asked the question.
[00:29:41.324 --> 00:29:47.447]  Al-Qaeda leader is now writing columns for the London Guardian.
[00:29:48.567 --> 00:29:49.828]  Stay with us.
[00:29:49.828 --> 00:29:51.228]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.228 --> 00:29:53.770]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.770 --> 00:30:01.334]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.334 --> 00:30:15.782]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:30:16.809 --> 00:30:21.511]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:30:21.511 --> 00:30:34.256]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:30:34.256 --> 00:30:41.519]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:30:42.219 --> 00:30:52.606]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:30:52.606 --> 00:30:56.529]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:30:56.529 --> 00:30:59.631]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:31:01.519 --> 00:31:06.221]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[00:31:06.221 --> 00:31:12.663]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[00:31:12.663 --> 00:31:14.924]  Number one, study the past.
[00:31:14.924 --> 00:31:17.325]  History really does repeat itself.
[00:31:17.325 --> 00:31:21.047]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[00:31:22.168 --> 00:31:25.270]  Number three, take decisive action.
[00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:29.113]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[00:31:29.113 --> 00:31:38.159]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves, warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[00:31:38.159 --> 00:31:41.581]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[00:31:41.581 --> 00:31:45.203]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:31:46.044 --> 00:31:50.989]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[00:31:50.989 --> 00:31:55.614]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:31:55.614 --> 00:31:58.297]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:32:00.939 --> 00:32:02.641]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:32:02.641 --> 00:32:07.946]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:32:07.946 --> 00:32:09.488]  Saving means to make money.
[00:32:09.488 --> 00:32:18.276]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:32:18.997 --> 00:32:26.542]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:32:26.542 --> 00:32:34.547]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:32:34.547 --> 00:32:39.770]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:41.931]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:32:44.693 --> 00:32:47.920]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:50.124]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:32:50.124 --> 00:32:52.429]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[00:33:20.196 --> 00:33:45.559]  You know, I think the point that I need to make, again, because it's so central, is that it is mentally ill to know that the government is run by corrupt, ruthless special interests who are above the law and are getting away with crazier and crazier stuff by the day,
[00:33:47.409 --> 00:33:55.551]  And then to continue, though, to believe anything the government or the media owned by these big banks tells you.
[00:33:55.551 --> 00:33:58.071]  That is crazy.
[00:33:58.071 --> 00:34:03.212]  I mean, if you had an employee that lied to you ten times, you'd fire him for sure on the second or third time.
[00:34:03.212 --> 00:34:04.493]  Wouldn't get to ten.
[00:34:04.493 --> 00:34:11.234]  If you had a neighbor that constantly lied to you, after three or four times, you'd learn that that guy's bad news and you'd stop talking to them.
[00:34:11.234 --> 00:34:13.335]  You might even move.
[00:34:13.335 --> 00:34:15.335]  I know I've moved before when I've had bad neighbors.
[00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:25.995]  But instead, because we don't feel like we can get rid of these criminals, we just kind of give in to them.
[00:34:25.995 --> 00:34:28.658]  Well, that's what the pimp does.
[00:34:28.658 --> 00:34:31.801]  He slaps me across the face.
[00:34:31.801 --> 00:34:34.103]  It's really a broken attitude.
[00:34:34.103 --> 00:34:45.434]  So yes, the people know, on average, every poll shows it, the vast majority, over 80%, know the government killed Kennedy, know the Federal Reserve's private ripping us off, and know that we're in trouble.
[00:34:46.764 --> 00:34:51.228]  And don't want the TSA sticking their hands down our pants, that's right at 90%.
[00:34:51.228 --> 00:34:58.295]  And don't want it at the NFL, that's above 85%.
[00:34:58.295 --> 00:35:01.017]  But the establishment's answer is not going to be...
[00:35:02.495 --> 00:35:03.896]  Oh, well, we'll just go away.
[00:35:03.896 --> 00:35:05.618]  No, they're used to having their way.
[00:35:05.618 --> 00:35:09.841]  That's why they proposed martial law in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
[00:35:09.841 --> 00:35:19.468]  That's why all over the country, they're just banning citizens communications or arresting people that try to politely bring up government corruption at city council meetings.
[00:35:19.468 --> 00:35:25.133]  That's why the North Carolina governor, the media is trying to say it was a joke now, but he told the newspaper it was not a joke.
[00:35:25.133 --> 00:35:31.978]  He said it seriously, that because of the crisis, they should just suspend Congress, suspend elections for two years.
[00:35:33.459 --> 00:35:35.187]  Which would be suspending Congress.
[00:35:35.187 --> 00:35:36.513]  It wouldn't be a real Congress anymore.
[00:35:37.403 --> 00:35:43.948]  And that's all part and parcel with the Super Congress making the spending decisions on what bills get brought forward.
[00:35:43.948 --> 00:35:45.669]  That is the power of the purse.
[00:35:45.669 --> 00:35:49.012]  Out of the General House into a Super Congress.
[00:35:49.012 --> 00:35:59.259]  The Senate now is involved in bringing forward, because there's Senators that are on it, along with House members, bringing forward spending legislation, completely unconstitutional.
[00:35:59.259 --> 00:36:06.425]  And then even so-called patriots and people out there can't get their minds around the fact that this is new and draconian.
[00:36:07.005 --> 00:36:10.587]  They're like, well we've had special committees before, not like this one we haven't.
[00:36:10.587 --> 00:36:13.909]  Ron Paul got it right and said it's not in the Constitution.
[00:36:13.909 --> 00:36:19.092]  But, that's not even strong enough language for what we're dealing with.
[00:36:19.092 --> 00:36:22.995]  So what happens is, people just get accustomed to tyranny.
[00:36:22.995 --> 00:36:24.235]  By degree.
[00:36:24.235 --> 00:36:33.601]  And they make more and more and more and more excuses for it.
[00:36:33.601 --> 00:36:35.002]  Look at this stack of news right here.
[00:36:36.783 --> 00:36:40.464]  In fact, if you give me a document cam shot in there, PrisonPlanet.TV folks can watch this.
[00:36:40.464 --> 00:36:43.525]  All this news is up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:36:43.525 --> 00:36:47.365]  If you're a radio listener, you can go check it out.
[00:36:47.365 --> 00:36:52.687]  OnStar kills plan to track ex-subscribers.
[00:36:52.687 --> 00:37:02.529]  Every time they get criticized for this by the alternative media and it gets picked up, they say, okay, we won't do that now.
[00:37:03.186 --> 00:37:16.596]  You notice they sent a message out saying, even if you opt out or turn off the service, we're going to have audio link and listen to you, and we're going to track everywhere you go, and we're going to sell that to insurance companies and the government.
[00:37:16.596 --> 00:37:20.999]  You don't think they have all this technology because they care about you.
[00:37:20.999 --> 00:37:24.762]  You don't just think you get a digital cable box because they love you.
[00:37:24.762 --> 00:37:27.864]  It's tracking everything you do.
[00:37:27.864 --> 00:37:32.108]  There was a public school in California, another one in Pennsylvania.
[00:37:32.807 --> 00:37:37.789]  A few years ago, they came out and said, kids be good, we're watching you at home over your laptop.
[00:37:37.789 --> 00:37:42.412]  And it was a minority of parents came out and said, well, that's big brother.
[00:37:42.412 --> 00:37:45.853]  And the school said, no, that's safety.
[00:37:45.853 --> 00:37:52.917]  And then the school had such disdain, when they got criticized, they suddenly switched gears and lied and said, we're not listening or watching you.
[00:37:54.295 --> 00:37:57.296]  They said, but you were on the news, here you are saying it.
[00:37:57.296 --> 00:38:00.376]  So lawsuits were filed and the thousands of videos.
[00:38:00.376 --> 00:38:06.638]  It was tens of thousands of videos and tens of thousands of photos of kids in the shower.
[00:38:06.638 --> 00:38:12.959]  The school administrators, the teachers could hardly get their work done watching the kids at home.
[00:38:12.959 --> 00:38:18.841]  Police were calling kids into the principal's office because they were seen eating pills.
[00:38:18.841 --> 00:38:19.801]  Turned out it was Skittles.
[00:38:22.934 --> 00:38:39.266]  I've noticed that when I was warning people about this beforehand, when these big companies were bragging in their stock perspectives, boildowns and stockholder reports, that they were watching everybody at home and tracking everybody and listening to everybody and every major company was doing it.
[00:38:39.266 --> 00:38:45.291]  Telecommunications Act since 96, everything wired in by federal regulatory law to do this.
[00:38:47.381 --> 00:38:51.782]  But see, they weren't ready for the public to know about that at that time.
[00:38:51.782 --> 00:38:53.462]  So I'd talk about it and show documents.
[00:38:53.462 --> 00:38:56.643]  They'd be like, you know, national TV, local news.
[00:38:56.643 --> 00:38:58.944]  This guy is a lunatic.
[00:38:58.944 --> 00:39:03.045]  The government, the corporations would never do that to you.
[00:39:03.045 --> 00:39:08.426]  Now that we've been eased into this, they're like, oh yeah, every big company's doing it.
[00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:13.432]  That's actually their biggest profit margin.
[00:39:13.432 --> 00:39:14.173]  Why?
[00:39:14.173 --> 00:39:25.902]  The major pizza chains are now, in some cases, making more money per quarter on tips to law enforcement because they get 25% of the fines and fees than they do off pizza sales.
[00:39:25.902 --> 00:39:28.204]  I remember seeing a case, must have been 15, 16 years.
[00:39:28.204 --> 00:39:32.087]  No, my grandfather was really still alive and in good shape then.
[00:39:32.087 --> 00:39:39.313]  I guess that was actually in... I was in high school.
[00:39:39.313 --> 00:39:40.434]  That was like 20 years ago.
[00:39:41.587 --> 00:39:46.352]  I remember I used to go over some Sundays and watch 60 Minutes when my grandma made dinner.
[00:39:46.352 --> 00:39:47.894]  Grandma's still alive.
[00:39:47.894 --> 00:39:48.995]  And watch 60 Minutes.
[00:39:48.995 --> 00:39:50.877]  I'll never forget watching 60 Minutes.
[00:39:50.877 --> 00:39:56.883]  And it was about how the airline ticket people, in many cases, make double or triple.
[00:39:56.883 --> 00:40:04.311]  One lady was paid $30-something thousand a year, and she's made over $100,000 that year, when people paid cash calling air marshals on them.
[00:40:05.339 --> 00:40:07.880]  And then they would just confiscate the cash and go, you shouldn't have $10,000.
[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:11.300]  And it was a case where the guy sued and fought back.
[00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:15.221]  He was from South Carolina, flying to Houston.
[00:40:15.221 --> 00:40:16.941]  And he liked the cash business.
[00:40:16.941 --> 00:40:18.742]  It turned out his taxes were all paid and everything.
[00:40:18.742 --> 00:40:21.362]  And then he'd get a discount for paying cash.
[00:40:21.362 --> 00:40:22.503]  He's an old guy.
[00:40:22.503 --> 00:40:29.284]  On the barrelhead for the trees, they would then ship by 18-wheeler, a whole bunch of 18-wheelers up to the Carolinas.
[00:40:31.022 --> 00:40:36.686]  And they took his $10,000 and everything, and it turned out that that ticket teller was getting some of the money.
[00:40:36.686 --> 00:40:45.392]  I remember watching 60 Minutes, actually a pretty good show sometimes, kind of old-line journalism.
[00:40:45.392 --> 00:40:55.878]  I mean, they're still globalists, but they're so arrogant and want to be on top that they still report on things about major hospitals killing people for their organs.
[00:40:55.878 --> 00:40:59.461]  Of course, it was the usual suspect, Illinois, New York, places like that.
[00:41:00.765 --> 00:41:05.668]  And of course, just a few years before, my dad said, do not sign your organ donor card.
[00:41:05.668 --> 00:41:09.931]  Word is, in Dallas hospitals, they won't save you and will harvest your organs.
[00:41:09.931 --> 00:41:15.834]  And my dad was a dentist, oral surgeon, and had worked rewiring jaws and things in hospitals and knew a lot of doctors.
[00:41:15.834 --> 00:41:19.276]  But I still remember thinking my dad was crazy when I was doing my driving test when I was 15.
[00:41:19.276 --> 00:41:22.558]  He said, do not sign that organ donor card, son.
[00:41:22.558 --> 00:41:25.060]  Do not sign it.
[00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:28.862]  Because the word is, doctors in town say, don't sign it.
[00:41:31.442 --> 00:41:33.862]  But that's just a doctor-to-doctor thing, you see.
[00:41:33.862 --> 00:41:39.083]  And I'm thinking, my dad is a funny guy, he's a smart guy, but come on.
[00:41:39.083 --> 00:41:41.104]  This stuff isn't true.
[00:41:41.104 --> 00:41:44.884]  And then, 60 Minutes, they're taking your organs.
[00:41:44.884 --> 00:41:50.705]  They caught them in Austin taking organs of people and letting them die to get them, and taking their corneas.
[00:41:50.705 --> 00:41:55.966]  That's the big ones.
[00:41:55.966 --> 00:41:59.427]  They even had one case where they thought they'd let the guy die and he
[00:42:01.206 --> 00:42:07.188]  They'd let the anesthesia go away, and they'd already taken one of his kidneys.
[00:42:07.188 --> 00:42:08.389]  That happened a few years ago.
[00:42:08.389 --> 00:42:16.111]  He woke up on the operating table, and the doctors were like, put him down, and a nurse rebelled, so the guy got sewed up and lived.
[00:42:16.111 --> 00:42:18.192]  That's why we know about it.
[00:42:18.192 --> 00:42:19.592]  That's how crime works, though.
[00:42:19.592 --> 00:42:24.174]  Because that's how those hospitals work.
[00:42:24.174 --> 00:42:28.115]  They'll give those doctors a little cut on the side of the 400, 500,000 organs they'll pull out of somebody.
[00:42:33.672 --> 00:42:37.534]  And see, it's only our naivete that allows all this to happen.
[00:42:37.534 --> 00:42:58.884]  I know I keep going back to that, but I talk to men and women and others, and they can be successful business people, but if they're not tuned into the real world, they're only specialized in their area and they care about going to the movies or playing golf or collecting wristwatches or motorcycles or whatever it is, you tell them basic stuff that's absolute fact and they'll look at you like you're crazy.
[00:43:02.102 --> 00:43:12.785]  In fact, this morning I was listening to this local talk show host and he was talking about the conspiracy theorists that don't like OnStar listening to you and tracking you.
[00:43:12.785 --> 00:43:20.027]  So see, I was a kook before for saying it was happening, but now I'm still a kook.
[00:43:20.027 --> 00:43:20.827]  I'm still a kook.
[00:43:21.755 --> 00:43:26.699]  Now that it has come out and is admitted, I'm a kook for not liking it.
[00:43:26.699 --> 00:43:33.885]  That's like medical device seller guy I've talked to on air, but I've talked to other people in person it's happened to.
[00:43:33.885 --> 00:43:37.248]  And he went back to his company many years and said, look, I want to start working in the office.
[00:43:37.248 --> 00:43:40.631]  I want a desk job, even if it's a pay cut.
[00:43:40.631 --> 00:43:46.997]  Because I am tired of having my genitals grabbed all the time and going through this and they want to put me in microwave scanners.
[00:43:46.997 --> 00:43:49.379]  And his boss said, well, so you're a conspiracy theorist now.
[00:43:52.210 --> 00:43:53.651]  Now let's get this straight.
[00:43:53.651 --> 00:43:56.152]  He doesn't like going in a microwave oven.
[00:43:56.152 --> 00:43:58.332]  He doesn't like having his space violated.
[00:43:58.332 --> 00:44:03.154]  This is not disputed.
[00:44:03.154 --> 00:44:04.435]  This is going on.
[00:44:04.435 --> 00:44:06.956]  Not liking it is a conspiracy theorist.
[00:44:10.353 --> 00:44:29.710]  And, you know, some of these local shows, I only try to call in every two, three months, and this particular show, I've called him before, and this call screener says, no, Alex, I actually know the program director, and he's like, oh, please call him, we'd love to have you on any of the shows, but, you know, the call screener, oh, I talked to the host, they don't want your input.
[00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:35.895]  They just want to sit there and make jokes about me.
[00:44:35.895 --> 00:44:37.677]  Or when somebody calls in and brings up a fact,
[00:44:38.922 --> 00:44:42.926]  Well hey, Ron Paul's actually winning many of these polls in second or third place.
[00:44:42.926 --> 00:44:50.292]  Oh yeah, and they start playing X-Files music or Imperial Battle March and go, that sounds like Alex Jones.
[00:44:50.292 --> 00:44:56.558]  Turning the light on at night if you go outside to put something in the trash can is evil.
[00:44:56.558 --> 00:44:57.419]  It's a conspiracy theory.
[00:44:58.467 --> 00:45:01.990]  Thinking, being involved, watching your step.
[00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:03.391]  It's weird.
[00:45:03.391 --> 00:45:09.335]  You see, it's an attribute to be a sucker, to be a chump, to be an idiot.
[00:45:09.335 --> 00:45:10.796]  I mean, this is beyond 1984.
[00:45:10.796 --> 00:45:24.006]  In this nightmare horrid future that he foresaw under English socialism, Eric Blair, pen name George Orwell, imagined where there's cameras and microphones at the park hidden.
[00:45:25.499 --> 00:45:29.022]  And where your TV watches you two-way.
[00:45:29.022 --> 00:45:52.180]  I mean, I remember a engineer from Time Warner contacting me 15 years ago, and then even coming to my house and meeting with me, and showing me the scientific Atlantic cable box, and showing me how there was a built-in microphone.
[00:45:53.374 --> 00:45:59.618]  And explaining that no one, it wasn't in the manual, it wasn't advertised what you would use it for, and that it was two-way.
[00:45:59.618 --> 00:46:06.281]  And that they were gonna come out with DVR systems soon, other companies were, and that it was gonna track everything you did.
[00:46:06.281 --> 00:46:07.922]  Of course, now that's all admitted.
[00:46:07.922 --> 00:46:15.186]  And I went on air and warned people and got laughed at, and then years later, out of Time Warner, cable guy at the house, one of the installers, I said, you know that's got a microphone?
[00:46:15.186 --> 00:46:18.648]  The guy's like, yeah, I know it's got one, but so what?
[00:46:18.648 --> 00:46:20.750]  Why are you, you act like I was weird,
[00:46:22.824 --> 00:46:26.707]  This is what I'm talking about here.
[00:46:26.707 --> 00:46:28.228]  Oh, you don't like people grabbing your genitals.
[00:46:28.228 --> 00:46:29.829]  You're a conspiracy theorist.
[00:46:29.829 --> 00:46:32.511]  That's like saying, I like strawberry ice cream, not chocolate.
[00:46:32.511 --> 00:46:37.095]  And they say, oh, you're, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[00:46:37.095 --> 00:46:40.758]  Uh, you know, I prefer Dodge over Ford.
[00:46:40.758 --> 00:46:42.799]  You're, you're, you're a conspiracy.
[00:46:42.799 --> 00:46:45.701]  Thinking is now a conspiracy theory.
[00:46:45.701 --> 00:46:49.004]  I prefer lime, Tapachico mineral water over regular.
[00:46:52.594 --> 00:47:02.142]  See, it's a throwaway line that they now just use against people.
[00:47:02.142 --> 00:47:12.271]  It's like when that trader came out, that stock trader came out on Goldman Sachs and said, they rule the world, we're going to have a depression, money's all going out of Europe.
[00:47:12.271 --> 00:47:19.857]  And BBC responded to their own report, Forbes did, I covered it last night on the Nightly News, and said, is this a hoax?
[00:47:19.857 --> 00:47:20.758]  Is he a real trader?
[00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:29.358]  Because what he said was so true, they just tried to imply, oh, it's a hoax, instead of making it about the real issues he talked about.
[00:47:29.358 --> 00:47:31.000]  They always want to change the subject.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:34.245]  So they had articles out earlier in the week going, is OnStar really listening?
[00:47:36.087 --> 00:47:50.233]  When it was sent to six million on-store customers in North America and was confirmed by hundreds of technology publications and blogs, still, last week and this week, it was, is it real?
[00:47:50.233 --> 00:47:50.793]  Is it real?
[00:47:50.793 --> 00:47:51.754]  Nightly news.
[00:47:51.754 --> 00:47:56.175]  They knew full well that it was real.
[00:47:56.175 --> 00:47:57.776]  But they had to first say, is it real?
[00:47:57.776 --> 00:48:00.977]  To discredit it in the mind and say, is it a conspiracy theory?
[00:48:00.977 --> 00:48:04.319]  And then say, okay, they are, but now they're not gonna listen to you and track you.
[00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:12.423]  But if you read the fine print, they're saying, okay, if you opt out, we won't track you anymore.
[00:48:12.423 --> 00:48:18.745]  But of course, these are big, brazen, exempt, immune, multinational, tax-exempt companies.
[00:48:18.745 --> 00:48:22.607]  They are going to continue.
[00:48:22.607 --> 00:48:24.527]  TomTom gets caught two years ago.
[00:48:24.527 --> 00:48:25.288]  They're caught again.
[00:48:26.345 --> 00:48:28.006]  Facebook caught two years ago.
[00:48:28.006 --> 00:48:29.126]  They're caught again.
[00:48:29.126 --> 00:48:30.307]  They're not caught.
[00:48:30.307 --> 00:48:31.807]  This is a bum rush.
[00:48:31.807 --> 00:48:40.031]  I remember 10 years ago, they had a big conference on RFID and tracking with big corporate leaders in Chicago.
[00:48:40.031 --> 00:48:42.232]  And I was reading through the transcript.
[00:48:42.232 --> 00:48:46.213]  A listener emailed it to me who had, and I went to the area.
[00:48:46.213 --> 00:48:54.637]  And it had the big CEO up there going, our prospectus analysis shows 87% of people are against RFID and tracker systems.
[00:48:55.205 --> 00:49:01.648]  But in another study we show that over 90% will end up submitting if we just force the issue.
[00:49:01.648 --> 00:49:07.050]  But we've got to have industry unification to have mass adoption of this system.
[00:49:07.050 --> 00:49:17.054]  And the total goal is total tracking and predictive systems that will allow us to predict future trends within close to 100% probability.
[00:49:17.054 --> 00:49:18.135]  Applause.
[00:49:18.135 --> 00:49:18.795]  They're up there.
[00:49:18.795 --> 00:49:21.436]  We have a crystal ball takeover system.
[00:49:21.436 --> 00:49:22.877]  We will force this through.
[00:49:24.212 --> 00:49:30.396]  I mean, they're just right there in your face saying, we are going to force this down their throats.
[00:49:30.396 --> 00:49:38.060]  And I can't even get the general public to wake up because they were preconditioned this didn't exist, instead of going, wow, I was lied to.
[00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:40.322]  This government and these corporations are out of control.
[00:49:40.322 --> 00:49:44.904]  It's like, well, okay, they're listening to us, but I still like the government, and maybe it's reasonable.
[00:49:44.904 --> 00:49:51.689]  It's this little ninnying thing where these metrosexual men
[00:49:52.679 --> 00:49:53.580]  I've noticed.
[00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:55.662]  They will like team up with the corruption.
[00:49:55.662 --> 00:49:58.124]  They'll go, I'm for that then.
[00:49:58.124 --> 00:50:06.872]  And it's just like, ah, just because you sit there and play in your mind, make believe that the government's your imaginary friend.
[00:50:06.872 --> 00:50:08.794]  It isn't your friend.
[00:50:08.794 --> 00:50:10.456]  You're a schmuck.
[00:50:10.456 --> 00:50:11.497]  That's the word for you.
[00:50:11.497 --> 00:50:16.842]  A schmuck, a sucker who loves a willful moron.
[00:50:18.786 --> 00:50:32.060]  And I am sick of willful morons who want to be slaves and then who all get together and go, I think it's good they're going door-to-door with forced inoculations in California under color of law.
[00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:33.001]  You should do that.
[00:50:33.001 --> 00:50:35.763]  I don't want to get sick from you not being vaccinated.
[00:50:35.763 --> 00:50:37.385]  Hey, moron!
[00:50:37.385 --> 00:50:41.770]  If you've been given a vaccine that protects you, then why do you care what I do with my body?
[00:50:43.393 --> 00:50:45.135]  Get out of my life!
[00:50:45.135 --> 00:50:47.697]  I got all this fake racism news too they're really pushing.
[00:50:47.697 --> 00:50:53.904]  It's now reached like a witch hunt for a guy was out in an ice cream cone outfit from Puerto Rico.
[00:50:53.904 --> 00:50:55.846]  They thought it was a Klan event.
[00:50:55.846 --> 00:50:56.626]  It's all coming up.
[00:50:56.626 --> 00:50:57.527]  The Economy and More.
[00:50:57.527 --> 00:50:58.048]  Stay with us.
[00:51:00.578 --> 00:51:06.963]  Hey, Brian, if you could do just one thing today to ensure your family's food security, what would it be?
[00:51:06.963 --> 00:51:07.964]  That's easy, Bill.
[00:51:07.964 --> 00:51:12.108]  I'd head straight to SoupBeanSurvival.com.
[00:51:12.108 --> 00:51:13.609]  SoupBeanSurvival.com?
[00:51:13.609 --> 00:51:23.517]  I know, Bill, it sounds crazy, but this ancient secret has been around for over 8,000 years, and it truly is nature's super survival food.
[00:51:23.777 --> 00:51:24.378]  Really, Brian?
[00:51:24.378 --> 00:51:26.399]  The number one survival food?
[00:51:26.399 --> 00:51:28.521]  Well, certainly the forgotten survival food.
[00:51:28.521 --> 00:51:29.542]  Absolutely, Bill.
[00:51:29.542 --> 00:51:40.970]  The folks at soupbeansurvival.com scoured our planet to find the very best heirloom seeds to truly find nature's super survival food.
[00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:42.872]  Brian, these aren't grocery store beans, are they?
[00:51:43.232 --> 00:51:43.953]  No way, Bill.
[00:51:43.953 --> 00:51:46.635]  You're not going to find these beans in any grocery store.
[00:51:46.635 --> 00:51:50.077]  These are the absolute highest quality beans in the world.
[00:51:50.077 --> 00:51:52.759]  Visit soupbeanssurvival.com.
[00:51:52.759 --> 00:51:59.824]  That's soupbeanssurvival.com for all the information you're going to need for nature's super survival food.
[00:52:01.385 --> 00:52:12.354]  No one can deny that our media operation is the tip of the spear and it's because of our success that we have a responsibility to intensify our operations against the globalists 110%.
[00:52:12.354 --> 00:52:15.936]  We're only a month away from launching a weeknight news broadcast.
[00:52:30.888 --> 00:52:33.350]  The social network is nearing completion as well.
[00:52:33.350 --> 00:52:36.273]  The free newsletter is reaching hundreds of thousands.
[00:52:36.273 --> 00:52:40.556]  Please spread the word about InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:52:40.556 --> 00:52:49.604]  Sign up at the top of InfoWars.com for the free InfoWars Insider email with exclusive video and text reports as well as breaking news.
[00:52:49.984 --> 00:52:51.666]  Look in the mirror.
[00:52:51.666 --> 00:52:53.708]  You are the resistance.
[00:52:53.708 --> 00:52:59.813]  It is up to us, the Info Warriors, to take the initiative and to defeat the globalists.
[00:52:59.813 --> 00:53:03.657]  If you're a man over 40, you may feel like half the man you used to be.
[00:53:03.657 --> 00:53:05.218]  Are you gaining more body fat?
[00:53:05.218 --> 00:53:06.579]  Are you feeling tired?
[00:53:06.579 --> 00:53:08.541]  Are you losing your sex drive?
[00:53:08.541 --> 00:53:09.682]  It's not your fault.
[00:53:09.682 --> 00:53:12.725]  After 40, your body's testosterone may start dropping.
[00:53:12.725 --> 00:53:14.607]  And if you're an African-American man,
[00:53:14.847 --> 00:53:18.731]  You're at a higher risk of your testosterone turning into estrogen.
[00:53:18.731 --> 00:53:20.253]  Be the man you used to be.
[00:53:20.253 --> 00:53:29.883]  Call for a risk-free trial of Ageless Male, a natural supplement shown to raise testosterone by 61% and maintain healthy, normal levels.

[00:53:36.010 --> 00:53:37.831]  No injections or appointments.

[00:53:39.332 --> 00:53:41.754]  Get your risk-free trial of Ageless Mail.
[00:53:41.754 --> 00:53:42.014]  Call 1-800-497-8345.
[00:53:42.014 --> 00:53:42.274]  That's 1-800-497-8345.
[00:53:42.274 --> 00:53:44.636]  With Ageless Mail, you can raise your testosterone naturally by 61%.
[00:53:44.636 --> 00:53:44.896]  Call 1-800-497-8345.
[00:53:44.896 --> 00:53:45.216]  That's 1-800-497-8345.
[00:54:07.346 --> 00:54:19.796]  All right, I want to get into some economic news ahead of Wayne Madsen joining us on some geopolitical developments, including Iran saying they're going to send warships to the U.S.
[00:54:19.796 --> 00:54:20.637]  coast.
[00:54:20.637 --> 00:54:22.458]  That's a horrible idea.
[00:54:22.458 --> 00:54:26.662]  OnStarKill's plan to track X subscribers.
[00:54:26.662 --> 00:54:32.767]  And again, they've now come out and said, OK, we're not going to track you now, even if you never activate it.
[00:54:34.372 --> 00:54:42.656]  See, something shouldn't like that shouldn't come as a automatic in all General Motors cars.
[00:54:42.656 --> 00:54:44.377]  You should have to opt into that.
[00:54:44.377 --> 00:54:48.439]  But notice, oh, here it is, but don't worry, you don't have to turn it on.
[00:54:48.439 --> 00:54:49.639]  Yeah, right.
[00:54:49.639 --> 00:54:50.580]  Here's another one.
[00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:56.163]  Facebook tracks your every move even after you're logged out.
[00:54:56.163 --> 00:54:58.003]  That was on InfoWars.com yesterday.
[00:54:58.003 --> 00:54:59.684]  Now today.
[00:54:59.684 --> 00:55:02.926]  We didn't mean to track you, says Facebook, as social network giant.
[00:55:04.406 --> 00:55:09.968]  Admits to bugs in new privacy row or fight.
[00:55:09.968 --> 00:55:11.429]  Remember what Zuckerman said?
[00:55:11.429 --> 00:55:15.011]  He said, you're a bunch of dumb effers.
[00:55:15.011 --> 00:55:20.113]  He said, our users trust us and just started laughing.
[00:55:20.113 --> 00:55:21.253]  Oh, it's so much fun.
[00:55:21.253 --> 00:55:25.755]  He admitted he did that.
[00:55:25.755 --> 00:55:29.857]  See, the globalists revel in the fact that you don't want to believe they're bad people.
[00:55:30.836 --> 00:55:36.542]  And so because you won't admit that, they've got free reign over you.
[00:55:36.542 --> 00:55:39.625]  They've got free reign over all of us.
[00:55:39.625 --> 00:55:41.306]  Alright, I got a bunch of other news.
[00:55:41.306 --> 00:55:42.207]  This is getting insane.
[00:55:42.207 --> 00:55:43.688]  Drudge linked to this yesterday.
[00:55:43.688 --> 00:55:47.752]  AP labeled racist for accurately transcribing Obama's speech.
[00:55:48.871 --> 00:55:55.376]  Meanwhile, a Puerto Rican guy, I don't even know what the Ku Klux Klan is, was in an ice cream outfit and people thought it was the Klan, caused a big freakout.
[00:55:55.376 --> 00:55:58.938]  They got a UC Berkeley bake sale, ignites protest.
[00:55:58.938 --> 00:55:59.219]  Why?
[00:55:59.219 --> 00:56:07.164]  They got a law about to be signed by the governor that says if you're black you pay a lot less tuition and that is discriminatory.
[00:56:07.164 --> 00:56:08.785]  Two wrongs don't make a right.
[00:56:08.785 --> 00:56:12.168]  So they're calling them racist for illustrating it.
[00:56:12.168 --> 00:56:13.449]  For illustrating the racism.
[00:56:15.322 --> 00:56:19.603]  The Air Force is going to be targeting on the highways of America, underage drinkers.
[00:56:19.603 --> 00:56:22.664]  That's how they've decided to roll out troops on the streets.
[00:56:22.664 --> 00:56:24.185]  That's all coming up.
[00:56:24.185 --> 00:56:28.186]  But I wanted to briefly bring Ted Anderson up, maybe towards the end too with another update.
[00:56:28.186 --> 00:56:30.767]  This is exactly what Ted said was happening Monday.
[00:56:30.767 --> 00:56:35.449]  Comex gold ends solidly higher on bargain hunting, weaker US dollars.
[00:56:35.449 --> 00:56:37.849]  The dollar only spiked for a while.
[00:56:37.849 --> 00:56:39.250]  Higher crude oil prices.
[00:56:40.831 --> 00:56:43.659]  Gold silver jump as dollar sags.
[00:56:43.659 --> 00:56:44.843]  Selling pressure eases.
[00:56:44.843 --> 00:56:47.370]  So that's from Kitco, Forbes, and Barron's.
[00:56:48.602 --> 00:56:52.043]  And they admit that it's all the big margin increases.
[00:56:52.043 --> 00:56:55.964]  They've basically made it super hard to trade in gold digitally.
[00:56:55.964 --> 00:56:59.665]  But all that's doing is forcing people into the physical market, Ted has found.
[00:56:59.665 --> 00:57:01.225]  I want to be clear with you.
[00:57:01.225 --> 00:57:06.026]  Ted is having 10 times the sales he has ever seen right now.
[00:57:06.026 --> 00:57:11.548]  You would think that people, he's the owner of Genesis, the owner of Modest Resources, Great Patriot.
[00:57:12.472 --> 00:57:16.740]  You would think, because in the past, when gold's down, people don't buy, which I think is stupid.
[00:57:16.740 --> 00:57:18.243]  Ted and I buy when it's down.
[00:57:18.243 --> 00:57:20.126]  This is a buying opportunity for gold and silver.
[00:57:20.126 --> 00:57:21.408]  The market fundamentals are all there.
[00:57:22.691 --> 00:57:27.352]  People have actually gotten that, and Ted is basically selling out of most of everything he's got.
[00:57:27.352 --> 00:57:28.972]  Ted, this is the first time you've seen this.
[00:57:28.972 --> 00:57:30.072]  This is a big deal.
[00:57:30.072 --> 00:57:30.972]  Yeah, it is a big deal.
[00:57:30.972 --> 00:57:37.333]  I can tell you right now, I've talked to a lot of wholesalers across the United States and other gold dealers, too, and it's all the same thing.
[00:57:37.333 --> 00:57:41.814]  They've been able to force people out of the futures market, but they haven't done anything with the physicals.
[00:57:41.814 --> 00:57:49.215]  Even Bloomberg was reporting yesterday that China, the demand for jewelry just went through the roof when the price went down.
[00:57:49.215 --> 00:57:51.336]  It's like people are moving into the physical market.
[00:57:52.516 --> 00:57:54.978]  They look at the warning signs and everything that's going on.
[00:57:54.978 --> 00:57:57.579]  They're moving into the bullion market.
[00:57:57.579 --> 00:58:03.623]  All they're taking out are the people that are trading in the futures market, which has a tendency to drive the market forces.
[00:58:03.623 --> 00:58:11.667]  But I can tell you right now, if you can stomach the volatility, the governments, and I don't even think this is coming out of Washington, D.C.
[00:58:11.667 --> 00:58:19.212]  I would say the central banks that control the world, that New World Order you always talk about, is pushing the reserve requirements down.
[00:58:19.212 --> 00:58:20.693]  And that's why we have the volatility.
[00:58:20.693 --> 00:58:21.313]  That's why we can
[00:58:21.813 --> 00:58:23.355]  Get a better buy at this time.
[00:58:23.355 --> 00:58:25.076]  But it is starting to go back up, folks.
[00:58:25.076 --> 00:58:28.679]  So, get on the gold train, silver train today.
[00:58:28.679 --> 00:58:34.264]  Call and ask about the index of radio specials they've got at the lower prices.
[00:58:34.264 --> 00:58:36.886]  800-686-2237.
[00:58:36.886 --> 00:58:43.231]  Don't lose this opportunity.
[00:58:43.231 --> 00:58:47.195]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:50.575 --> 00:58:51.755]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:58:51.755 --> 00:58:58.678]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:58:58.678 --> 00:59:01.239]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:59:01.239 --> 00:59:06.621]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:59:06.621 --> 00:59:09.662]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:59:09.662 --> 00:59:11.723]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:59:11.983 --> 00:59:18.228]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:59:18.228 --> 00:59:21.611]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:59:21.611 --> 00:59:27.396]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:59:27.396 --> 00:59:29.037]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:59:29.037 --> 00:59:30.338]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:59:30.338 --> 00:59:33.000]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:37.224]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:59:37.224 --> 00:59:39.265]  You can find the video at www.
[00:59:40.006 --> 00:59:41.827]  End of America 3.com.
[00:59:41.827 --> 00:59:44.409]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[00:59:44.409 --> 00:59:48.291]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:59:48.291 --> 00:59:53.615]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:59:53.615 --> 00:59:55.996]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.996 --> 00:59:58.798]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.322 --> 01:00:10.145]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.145 --> 01:00:11.726]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.726 --> 01:00:13.286]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.286 --> 01:00:17.469]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.469 --> 01:00:24.553]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.553 --> 01:00:29.676]  Well, thousands of heat-seeking missiles have been given to Al Qaeda in Afghanistan.
[01:00:31.269 --> 01:00:35.011]  Al Qaeda has been given control of the towns and cities they have.
[01:00:35.011 --> 01:00:39.473]  Qaddafi's still fighting on, but the media has just moved from saying the war is over.
[01:00:39.473 --> 01:00:40.553]  U.S.
[01:00:40.553 --> 01:00:42.334]  troops are on the ground.
[01:00:42.334 --> 01:00:51.478]  Wayne Madsen's going to be popping in to cover that, the Iranian situation, all of this spy grid that's going on and now being more and more admitted.
[01:00:51.478 --> 01:00:57.101]  But, Ted, this is really big news, that in your 30-plus years and in my
[01:00:58.180 --> 01:01:00.603]  Even before you had Genesis, you were a sponsor of my show.
[01:01:00.603 --> 01:01:02.947]  You've been a sponsor about 15 and a half years, Ted.
[01:01:02.947 --> 01:01:07.352]  You've been there about a year and a half after I got on air or less.
[01:01:07.352 --> 01:01:14.602]  I've never seen it where the general public buys when it goes down, which is what any good stockbroker or commodity trader will tell you.
[01:01:14.602 --> 01:01:15.604]  Buy low, sell high.
[01:01:17.062 --> 01:01:17.843]  That's when I buy.
[01:01:17.843 --> 01:01:24.087]  And I've never sold because I'm doing it as an emergency backup.
[01:01:24.087 --> 01:01:28.030]  But I have total confidence it would go back up, as I said Monday, as I said yesterday.
[01:01:28.030 --> 01:01:33.414]  And it is starting to go back up because of global devaluation of currencies.
[01:01:33.414 --> 01:01:40.900]  I would rather have a stable future and actually see gold and silver drop and my investments not be good.
[01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:42.741]  Because overall, the economy would be better.
[01:01:43.581 --> 01:01:46.303]  It would be better for everybody.
[01:01:46.303 --> 01:01:50.087]  And the other business operations we have would do better.
[01:01:50.087 --> 01:01:51.168]  It's a win-win.
[01:01:51.168 --> 01:01:53.149]  But I know that we're not going down that path.
[01:01:53.149 --> 01:01:55.231]  We're going the Weimar Republic path.
[01:01:55.231 --> 01:01:59.395]  And I've seen them do this, hammering the gold down and the silver down over and over again.
[01:01:59.395 --> 01:02:02.538]  And then it always retraces and only goes back up.
[01:02:02.538 --> 01:02:08.543]  But I guess it's taken four or five times of this happening in the last three years for people to finally get it.
[01:02:08.543 --> 01:02:10.064]  I mean, this is big news, Ted.
[01:02:10.805 --> 01:02:19.147]  That you're seeing ten times the business you had a month ago, two or three times any previous record you had to that, even in bull markets.
[01:02:19.147 --> 01:02:23.047]  How big of a deal is this, Ted, that people finally get it?
[01:02:23.047 --> 01:02:30.849]  Well, I mean, I can tell you it's certainly a turnaround because in the past, when the market would fall, people would just back off and they'd quit buying.
[01:02:30.849 --> 01:02:37.990]  And, you know, it would give opportunities for me to go, okay, I can see that it's time for me to buy because everybody else don't want it.
[01:02:38.570 --> 01:02:57.197]  But right now, with the governments, and I keep saying governments, but it's really not, with them in there manipulating and trying to raise the reserve requirements to get into a futures contract, they are, they're messing with the paper system, but obviously the people of the world right now are looking at it and going, you know what, I don't believe you guys, I don't think
[01:02:57.637 --> 01:02:59.819]  That we're running into better economic times.
[01:02:59.819 --> 01:03:01.521]  I can read the news myself.
[01:03:01.521 --> 01:03:04.404]  I mean, my goodness, look what CNN had reported.
[01:03:04.404 --> 01:03:07.967]  It says Greece, Portugal, and Ireland are on life support.
[01:03:07.967 --> 01:03:11.071]  Italy and Spain are exhibiting worrisome symptoms.
[01:03:11.071 --> 01:03:15.515]  And Germany and France, the healthy ones, are suffering from global economic malaise.
[01:03:15.715 --> 01:03:22.263]  Our listeners have heard all of our experts and ourselves tell them no matter how big the bailout, it's only going to get worse.
[01:03:22.263 --> 01:03:26.427]  That's why our credibility continues to rise, Ted.
[01:03:26.427 --> 01:03:30.252]  What do you see happening with silver and gold coming up in the next few weeks?
[01:03:30.572 --> 01:03:39.236]  Well, I mean, for sure, in the next few weeks, it's going to be questionable as to whether or not the globalists will lose control over the futures market.
[01:03:39.236 --> 01:03:45.839]  They may be able to hold gold and silver at the $1,600 to $1,700 level for a little while, but you know what?
[01:03:45.839 --> 01:03:49.101]  They will lose control, and it'll continue to increase.
[01:03:49.101 --> 01:03:50.562]  I can tell you this.
[01:03:50.562 --> 01:03:58.986]  In my lifetime, I've never seen a time where the dollars gained purchasing power and inflation has gone in reverse, and I've actually been able to buy more with my money.
[01:03:59.346 --> 01:04:00.346]  It just hasn't happened.
[01:04:00.346 --> 01:04:01.507]  Cars have gone up.
[01:04:01.507 --> 01:04:02.287]  Everything has gone up.
[01:04:02.287 --> 01:04:03.407]  Houses and whatever.
[01:04:03.407 --> 01:04:04.448]  You name it.
[01:04:04.448 --> 01:04:13.030]  But now we're sitting in this crises thing and they're thinking that they can solve this problem by making it so you can't trade futures contracts.
[01:04:13.030 --> 01:04:20.392]  I mean, it's like, you know, what they're trying to do is they're trying to pass legislation to force people out of the gold market and that's just not going to happen.
[01:04:20.392 --> 01:04:24.073]  It's not going to push people back into the currency and think that paper is better again.
[01:04:24.073 --> 01:04:26.474]  People want to have gold because they know they can trust it.
[01:04:27.034 --> 01:04:29.958]  And that's why people are buying it right now, and they should be.
[01:04:29.958 --> 01:04:38.069]  And, you know, perfect example as to why they should be getting involved with those silver dollars that we talked about and the video and the book.
[01:04:38.069 --> 01:04:40.352]  I mean, now's the time to be moving.
[01:04:40.352 --> 01:04:42.054]  You have the opportunity.
[01:04:42.054 --> 01:04:42.875]  The prices are low.
[01:04:43.456 --> 01:04:44.497]  You're right, Ted.
[01:04:44.497 --> 01:04:46.698]  Folks, take advantage of it today.
[01:04:46.698 --> 01:04:48.239]  800-686-237.
[01:04:48.239 --> 01:04:53.143]  Ted has two silver dollars, a great book, and a film exposing the globalists.
[01:04:53.143 --> 01:04:55.805]  With shipping for $77.
[01:04:55.805 --> 01:04:57.846]  800-686-2237.
[01:04:57.846 --> 01:04:59.467]  Ask about other radio specials when you call.
[01:04:59.467 --> 01:05:04.151]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck with an urgent update from eFoods Direct.
[01:05:08.097 --> 01:05:16.881]  E-Foods Direct has been doing all we can this year to help you get food before the perfect storm of exploding food prices from the 2011 harvest.
[01:05:16.881 --> 01:05:21.682]  During September, E-Foods is giving you free shipping on your food supply orders.
[01:05:21.682 --> 01:05:25.824]  But you have to understand, we're entering the eye of the food cost storm.
[01:05:25.824 --> 01:05:32.707]  Ethanol is boosting gas prices and driving corn costs so high our wheat for bread is going into animal feed.
[01:05:33.087 --> 01:05:36.190]  And pasta wheat cost has doubled since last year.
[01:05:36.190 --> 01:05:41.334]  I strongly advise you to get your order in before the free shipping deadline September 30th.
[01:05:41.334 --> 01:05:45.377]  Free shipping including Alaska and Hawaii ends September 30th.
[01:05:45.377 --> 01:05:48.100]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex.
[01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:51.663]  That's 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex.
[01:05:51.663 --> 01:05:53.244]  Remember, you can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.
[01:06:01.937 --> 01:06:05.581]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:06:05.581 --> 01:06:09.184]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:06:09.184 --> 01:06:14.008]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:06:14.008 --> 01:06:20.374]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:06:20.374 --> 01:06:22.637]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:06:23.157 --> 01:06:24.778]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:06:24.778 --> 01:06:25.799]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:06:25.799 --> 01:06:28.180]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:06:42.068 --> 01:06:44.190]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:06:44.190 --> 01:06:49.333]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:06:49.333 --> 01:06:58.460]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:07:01.604 --> 01:07:03.305]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:07:03.305 --> 01:07:08.607]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:07:08.607 --> 01:07:10.127]  Saving means to make money.
[01:07:10.127 --> 01:07:18.931]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:07:19.651 --> 01:07:27.194]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:07:27.194 --> 01:07:35.198]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:07:35.198 --> 01:07:42.601]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you had to do something you've never done before, getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:07:45.322 --> 01:07:50.966]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:50.966 --> 01:07:53.387]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:13.578 --> 01:08:18.043]  Coming up later in the transmission, I'm considering playing the audio.
[01:08:18.043 --> 01:08:21.426]  You can make it out, but I don't know if it's worthy of radio.
[01:08:21.426 --> 01:08:24.930]  It might not come across too good for our AM stations out there.
[01:08:24.930 --> 01:08:26.391]  It's up at InfoWars.com.
[01:08:26.391 --> 01:08:28.834]  It's up at DrugsReport.com at the very top.
[01:08:28.834 --> 01:08:30.275]  Easiest place to find it.
[01:08:30.275 --> 01:08:32.197]  You can hear the audio to the newspaper.
[01:08:33.038 --> 01:08:46.523]  And the governor is clearly, North Carolina Governor Bev Perdue, a Democrat, is proposing suspending the congressional elections for the cycle so legislators can focus on fixing the economy.
[01:08:46.523 --> 01:08:47.623]  And it was serious.
[01:08:47.623 --> 01:08:50.584]  The newspaper has said it was like it was serious.
[01:08:50.584 --> 01:08:53.005]  This is the kind of stuff that's being talked about.
[01:08:53.005 --> 01:08:54.966]  We already have a super Congress.
[01:08:54.966 --> 01:08:58.847]  Obama's already launching wars without congressional approval and saying he doesn't need them.
[01:09:00.233 --> 01:09:03.496]  The federal government is spying on us without warrants.
[01:09:03.496 --> 01:09:04.497]  I mean, it's all come out.
[01:09:04.497 --> 01:09:12.825]  TomTom, Facebook, all of them are spying on us without warrants, big time, in our face.
[01:09:12.825 --> 01:09:15.648]  And it's time that we face those facts.
[01:09:15.648 --> 01:09:20.453]  I want to go to Wayne Madsen on a host of issues, formerly with the National Security Agency.
[01:09:20.453 --> 01:09:21.374]  He's written for some of the
[01:09:22.366 --> 01:09:27.609]  Biggest publications in this country, really doesn't need much introduction, on this radio show.
[01:09:27.609 --> 01:09:30.250]  His website is WayneMadsenReport.com.
[01:09:30.250 --> 01:09:38.195]  He's also worked as one of the founders of Electronic Privacy Information Center, EPIC, that just does great work.
[01:09:38.195 --> 01:09:44.078]  And he joins us today to get into, well, just a bunch of different issues.
[01:09:44.909 --> 01:09:58.999]  First off, Wayne, from what I've seen with the different telecommunications acts, the cell phones, the Facebook, the telecommunications systems, the OnStar, I mean, it's always been spying on everybody.
[01:09:58.999 --> 01:10:02.942]  This is a total merger of government and big corporations.
[01:10:02.942 --> 01:10:06.645]  From your research dealing with this, why do you think it's coming out now?
[01:10:07.185 --> 01:10:10.347]  That OnStar's tracking you and listening to you with audio.
[01:10:10.347 --> 01:10:13.428]  And that Facebook's tracking everywhere you go, even when you leave Facebook.
[01:10:13.428 --> 01:10:15.490]  And TomTom's selling your data.
[01:10:15.490 --> 01:10:19.512]  Or when you call and order a pizza, they're selling that data to the cops.
[01:10:20.868 --> 01:10:31.678]  Well, I think this is something that's been going on as far as what's been on the FBI's wish list and other intelligence agencies and law enforcement agencies for quite some time.
[01:10:31.678 --> 01:10:35.321]  And now we're finally getting the devil in the details.
[01:10:35.321 --> 01:10:45.370]  And this is something that first started under the Clinton administration when we had this huge battle over the government retaining encryption keys to be able to
[01:10:46.210 --> 01:10:46.871]  We're good.
[01:10:56.356 --> 01:11:22.331]  In the event of a, um, uh, smoking gun, a kidnapping situation, all these, you know, worst case scenarios, and we always knew they were lying about it, that they just wanted to have these capabilities for their fishing expeditions, and lo and behold, that's what we seem to have now, that there is no criminal predicate when the FBI and the NSA and these other agencies conduct these, uh, forms of electronic surveillance, and here we have
[01:11:23.012 --> 01:11:25.017]  Everything is basically fair game.
[01:11:25.017 --> 01:11:30.611]  Everything's on the table as far as surveillance is concerned.
[01:11:30.611 --> 01:11:31.112]  Well, Wayne...
[01:11:32.498 --> 01:11:33.739]  Where is this going?
[01:11:33.739 --> 01:11:36.160]  Because you have this coming out now.
[01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:42.243]  It's Facebook and TomTom and OnStar and the rest of them telling on themselves.
[01:11:42.243 --> 01:11:45.064]  They're trying to send out little customer announcements.
[01:11:45.064 --> 01:11:49.627]  Hey, by the way, our main business is not you paying for your subscription.
[01:11:49.627 --> 01:11:53.268]  We're tracking everything you do and selling it to insurance companies, you name it.
[01:11:53.268 --> 01:11:54.769]  I mean, this is beyond 1984.
[01:11:57.244 --> 01:11:57.924]  Well, that's right.
[01:11:57.924 --> 01:12:05.908]  I think what they're trying to do is cover their butts from lawsuits from customers and people who feel that their privacy has been invaded.
[01:12:05.908 --> 01:12:14.992]  We had this battle a long time ago, too, on the issue of opt-in or opt-out as far as this type of surveillance is concerned.
[01:12:14.992 --> 01:12:21.115]  And clearly, we have these companies now engaging in an opt-out.
[01:12:21.115 --> 01:12:23.156]  You're already in their surveillance system.
[01:12:23.616 --> 01:12:28.958]  But now it seems like you don't even have a choice of whether to opt out or not.
[01:12:28.958 --> 01:12:35.580]  Well, yeah, that was the new controversy, is they've always said, hey, we're spying on you, but people wouldn't read their little terms and conditions.
[01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:38.841]  Now they're saying, we don't care if you buy the car and never turn it on.
[01:12:38.841 --> 01:12:40.642]  We're going to track everything you're doing.
[01:12:40.642 --> 01:12:44.763]  I mean, this is an outrageous, outrageous power grab.
[01:12:45.711 --> 01:12:54.073]  Well, absolutely, and of course they're sharing it with not only the government, but they're selling this information to other companies.
[01:12:54.073 --> 01:13:01.295]  And people always say, well, you know, what do you have to fear most, private companies or the government?
[01:13:01.295 --> 01:13:09.336]  Well, it's always been the case that the government and these private companies that traffic in this type of personal information are working together.
[01:13:09.336 --> 01:13:11.617]  So there's really no line between the two.
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:19.104]  Now, Wayne, is there anything else you want to add on this subject before I shift gears to Libya?
[01:13:19.104 --> 01:13:29.752]  I would just tell people, you know, that they need to be... What I do when I meet a confidential source is I get rid of the electronics altogether.
[01:13:29.752 --> 01:13:39.879]  When I meet somebody, it's face-to-face, and I take precautions that I'm not followed, that there's no boom microphones or shotgun microphones in the area.
[01:13:39.879 --> 01:13:43.042]  And if people want to engage in
[01:13:43.602 --> 01:13:48.363]  Uh, personal and sensitive, uh, confidential communications face-to-face.
[01:13:48.363 --> 01:13:50.044]  It's the only way.
[01:13:50.044 --> 01:13:56.845]  And even then you gotta watch it because they've got gunshot detectors in most cities that are actually high-powered acoustical microphones.
[01:13:56.845 --> 01:14:06.968]  They put these in in 98 in Austin, and the actual government grant admitted that that was a high-powered acoustic, um, shotgun mics that can be directed and listened through the windows of your house.
[01:14:07.768 --> 01:14:11.831]  Uh, from the vibration to the membrane, uh, that can listen to people hundreds of yards away.
[01:14:11.831 --> 01:14:17.595]  But they told everybody in Austin it was gunshot detectors to triangulate where the gunshots come from.
[01:14:17.595 --> 01:14:22.038]  And now they're all over the city in most areas, in parks, listening to everyone.
[01:14:22.038 --> 01:14:22.779]  Think about it.
[01:14:22.779 --> 01:14:23.920]  Land of the free, home of the brave.
[01:14:24.580 --> 01:14:35.150]  And OnStar admits they've got audio listening to you and they're selling where you go to the cops and the corporations and even if you don't want it on, it is.
[01:14:35.150 --> 01:14:44.759]  Now, looking at Libya, I, of course, you've been to Libya recently and Qaddafi's still there, still fighting, but now it's kind of moved off the front page of the news.
[01:14:45.559 --> 01:14:56.304]  And we have the Al-Qaeda commander who's in charge of Tripoli, and looks like he may be the new leader of the whole country, this Abdul Belhaj guy, now writing articles for The Guardian.
[01:14:56.304 --> 01:15:01.727]  We have that article out today at Infowars.com by Tony Cartolucci, breaking it down.
[01:15:01.727 --> 01:15:03.568]  But here's ABC News.
[01:15:03.568 --> 01:15:09.611]  A few weeks ago they were worried about heat-seeking surface-to-air missiles that could take down any passenger liner they want.
[01:15:09.611 --> 01:15:14.073]  Now they admit thousands of them are missing and have fallen into the hands of Al-Qaeda.
[01:15:15.233 --> 01:15:21.756]  And we're told they're having to move drones into Libya to bomb the rest of Africa because of Al-Qaeda, but they just put Al-Qaeda into power.
[01:15:21.756 --> 01:15:27.999]  So this looks like a real setup by the system to take even more liberty, saying they're protecting us from Al-Qaeda.
[01:15:28.988 --> 01:15:29.628]  Well, that's right.
[01:15:29.628 --> 01:15:46.857]  We also know from the ABC News report that now the Pentagon says they have to put personnel in Libya to be able to get these surface-to-air, these MANPADS, these handheld or shoulder-launched missile launchers.
[01:15:46.857 --> 01:15:50.599]  And so what we're seeing now is a reason to put
[01:15:51.179 --> 01:15:51.679]  We're good to go.
[01:16:12.529 --> 01:16:15.752]  So-called Al-Qaeda Brigades all over the world.
[01:16:15.752 --> 01:16:31.643]  I have a story up at my website today how the CIA is basically using Al-Qaeda, Jamaat, Islamia as a reason to destabilize or a means to destabilize the government of Indonesia, just like they've done in Pakistan.
[01:16:31.643 --> 01:16:36.307]  So this is the real purpose of these so-called jihadist groups.
[01:16:36.307 --> 01:16:38.529]  It's destabilization across
[01:16:40.711 --> 01:16:44.938]  From Morocco all the way over to Indonesia.
[01:16:44.938 --> 01:16:47.902]  And they used them against the Serbs and the Russians, everybody else.
[01:16:47.902 --> 01:16:53.432]  But if you have any geopolitical understanding, any common sense,
[01:16:55.632 --> 01:17:10.747]  You knock out Gaddafi, who's made peace deals, to put Al-Qaeda in, and then, oh, now we've got to occupy the country and use it for AFRICOM, as you predicted, as I predicted, as a base to invade other countries, to fight Al-Qaeda, who you actually just put into power.
[01:17:10.747 --> 01:17:12.008]  It's just a label.
[01:17:12.008 --> 01:17:16.272]  I mean, they could come just put an Al-Qaeda sticker on your door and say, well, we're taking your house.
[01:17:16.272 --> 01:17:17.353]  There's an Al-Qaeda sticker.
[01:17:17.353 --> 01:17:18.554]  It's a chess piece.
[01:17:18.554 --> 01:17:19.535]  They move around.
[01:17:20.296 --> 01:17:25.000]  To invade any country they want, even when they put the Al-Qaeda in power.
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:30.386]  I mean, it is... And Tony Blair can meet six times secretly with Qaddafi and invest with him.
[01:17:30.386 --> 01:17:33.368]  And all of this comes out and nobody gets in trouble.
[01:17:33.368 --> 01:17:35.430]  It's total la-la land.
[01:17:35.430 --> 01:17:37.953]  In closing, Wangs, I know you gotta go.
[01:17:37.953 --> 01:17:42.056]  I understand Iran, angry that US warships and others are all around them and that...
[01:17:42.813 --> 01:17:45.495]  Before the Iran-Iraq War, it had fully ended.
[01:17:45.495 --> 01:17:45.975]  The U.S.
[01:17:45.975 --> 01:17:51.458]  attacked and blew up most of the Iranian Navy, and then that big naval engagement nobody seems to know about.
[01:17:51.458 --> 01:17:56.841]  But in the final equation here, this is a big provocation.
[01:17:56.841 --> 01:17:59.863]  And I see they're saying it's hypocrisy.
[01:17:59.863 --> 01:18:00.823]  If the U.S.
[01:18:00.823 --> 01:18:07.887]  gets mad about Iranian warships off our coast and their national waters, well, why do you have your ships a half mile off our coast?
[01:18:07.887 --> 01:18:09.068]  But what's behind this?
[01:18:10.191 --> 01:18:20.224]  Well, I would note that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Admiral Mullen, recently stated that he thought there should be a hotline, a military hotline, between U.S.
[01:18:20.224 --> 01:18:25.852]  forces in the region and Iran's military to just prevent any sort of misunderstanding.
[01:18:26.833 --> 01:18:34.415]  Iranian speed boats that are basically under the control of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard that sometimes come out and circle U.S.
[01:18:34.415 --> 01:18:34.855]  warships.
[01:18:34.855 --> 01:18:45.159]  So this looks like it may be an attempt to scuttle that idea of Admiral Mullen to have his hotline by ratcheting things up.
[01:18:45.159 --> 01:18:55.722]  Of course, if Iran were to put ships off our coast, and it's not clear that they even have the capability, it would probably be something like we saw during the Soviet times, where
[01:18:56.742 --> 01:18:58.483]  I totally agree with that analysis.
[01:18:58.483 --> 01:19:00.244]  This is their military industrial complex.
[01:19:00.244 --> 01:19:04.726]  Their hardliners don't want to make friends as well because they want to use that as a way to stay in power.
[01:19:18.052 --> 01:19:18.612]  That's right.
[01:19:18.612 --> 01:19:19.173]  That's right.
[01:19:19.173 --> 01:19:33.419]  And just like we saw during the Cold War, I mean, a year after Kennedy was basically eliminated by our military-industrial complex, Nikita Khrushchev was eliminated by the Soviet military-industrial complex.
[01:19:33.419 --> 01:19:40.343]  We went from a burgeoning detente, of course, to the icy years of the Cold War.
[01:19:40.343 --> 01:19:42.023]  Wayne Madsen, WayneMadsenReport.com.

[01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:50.921]  Excellent analysis.
[01:19:50.921 --> 01:19:55.366]  So now I gotta give my rights up because thousands of heatseekers have been given to Al Qaeda.
[01:19:55.366 --> 01:19:58.350]  And our government put them in power and gave them the things.
[01:19:58.350 --> 01:19:59.451]  I mean, I'm sick of it!
[01:19:59.451 --> 01:20:00.832]  How obvious does it have to get?

[01:23:40.703 --> 01:23:41.163]  We're good.
[01:24:09.799 --> 01:24:11.040]  We are back live.
[01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:14.883]  I'm going to open the phones up now to the balance of the broadcast.
[01:24:14.883 --> 01:24:17.384]  I would love to hear from you.
[01:24:17.384 --> 01:24:21.367]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:24:21.367 --> 01:24:27.251]  On any of the news items or issues I've raised or any subject that you would like to talk about, we'd love to hear from you.
[01:24:27.251 --> 01:24:27.711]  800-259-9231.
[01:24:27.711 --> 01:24:29.612]  I'm going to look at commodities and what's happening
[01:24:34.656 --> 01:24:41.021]  With food prices a little bit coming up the next segment for part of the segment and then straight to your calls.
[01:24:41.021 --> 01:24:42.722]  I hope listeners call about this one.
[01:24:42.722 --> 01:24:45.524]  I mean does anyone buy this?
[01:24:45.524 --> 01:24:48.106]  We just saw Libya part of it handed over to Al-Qaeda.
[01:24:48.106 --> 01:24:51.709]  They're saying thousands of heat-seeking shoulder-fired missiles are missing.
[01:24:51.709 --> 01:24:57.253]  So I mean I said I said watch they're gonna go put Al-Qaeda in and then have to invade to get rid of Al-Qaeda.
[01:24:57.253 --> 01:24:58.574]  I mean there's just no end to it.
[01:24:59.599 --> 01:25:03.983]  There's no end to the fact that they think you're blind and unaware of what's happening.
[01:25:03.983 --> 01:25:05.564]  And here's ABC News.
[01:25:05.564 --> 01:25:07.786]  Al-Qaeda to Iran.
[01:25:07.786 --> 01:25:11.489]  Stop spreading 9-11 conspiracy theory.
[01:25:11.489 --> 01:25:12.891]  I can hear good old boys.
[01:25:12.891 --> 01:25:19.637]  Boy, even Al-Qaeda told that Ahmadinejad over there in the Middle East.
[01:25:19.637 --> 01:25:20.417]  He's not in the Middle East.
[01:25:20.417 --> 01:25:23.600]  He's in Persia, but they call him a Middle Easterner.
[01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:24.361]  Stop saying that.
[01:25:24.361 --> 01:25:25.222]  Well, he's an engineer.
[01:25:26.243 --> 01:25:37.931]  And we've got thousands of American engineers, and German, and others, and the former Italian president, the former head of intelligence for the German government, their former defense sec.
[01:25:37.931 --> 01:25:38.631]  We've had him on.
[01:25:38.631 --> 01:25:41.393]  We need to get Andres Famiglio back on.
[01:25:41.393 --> 01:25:42.134]  He hadn't been on in years.
[01:25:42.134 --> 01:25:44.555]  He speaks pretty good English.
[01:25:44.555 --> 01:25:47.377]  He wrote the best-selling book in Germany, The CIA Carried Out 9-11.
[01:25:47.377 --> 01:25:50.179]  That's what it translates out of in German.
[01:25:54.085 --> 01:26:03.632]  And we are to believe, because the Associated Press and others will just take a message board comment and say, oh, Al-Qaeda took responsibility for making Santa Claus wear a red hat.
[01:26:03.632 --> 01:26:07.594]  I mean, it's just absolute baloney.
[01:26:07.594 --> 01:26:13.459]  The terror group Al-Qaeda has found itself curiously in alignment and agreement.
[01:26:13.459 --> 01:26:15.780]  Well, they do that all the time.
[01:26:15.780 --> 01:26:18.122]  With the great Satan, which it calls the U.S.
[01:26:20.342 --> 01:26:30.446]  In issuing a stern message to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, stop spreading 9-11 conspiracy theories.
[01:26:30.446 --> 01:26:34.127]  That's got to really upset the globalists that everybody knows it's an inside job.
[01:26:34.127 --> 01:26:46.412]  In the latest issue of the Al-Qaeda English language magazine, Inspire, and I know Paul Watson and Kurt Nemo have written articles about Inspire connected to the State Department and Israel and others.
[01:26:46.412 --> 01:26:47.893]  In fact, I want to report on this.
[01:26:49.145 --> 01:26:59.831]  The problem with my guys is they know so much because they study this stuff 12, 14, 15 hours a day that I know when I go back there to Kurt and say, write about this, he'll go, but we did write about it a year ago.
[01:26:59.831 --> 01:27:04.413]  I know, but we've, or I'll tell Watson, we've got to write about it over and over again.
[01:27:04.413 --> 01:27:09.096]  They are going to continue to put these lies out.
[01:27:09.096 --> 01:27:15.579]  The latest issue of the Al Qaeda English language magazine put out by Adam Gadon, the grandson of the former head of the ADL.
[01:27:15.579 --> 01:27:16.900]  I mean, come on.
[01:27:18.646 --> 01:27:22.107]  Four of the five Al-Qaeda commanders in the top five, born in the U.S.
[01:27:22.107 --> 01:27:27.349]  I mean, imagine Al-Qaeda.
[01:27:27.349 --> 01:27:30.610]  Anti-Israel all the way, if you believe it exists.
[01:27:30.610 --> 01:27:32.850]  Going, oh yes, our commander is Jewish.
[01:27:32.850 --> 01:27:38.292]  I mean, this is so ridiculous.
[01:27:38.292 --> 01:27:43.834]  In the latest issue of the Al-Qaeda English Language Magazine, Inspire, an author appears to take offense
[01:27:45.310 --> 01:27:48.073]  An author, you mean at Laneley, Virginia?
[01:27:48.073 --> 01:27:56.400]  For the ridiculous theory, repeatedly spread by the leader of Iran, that 9-11 terror attacks were actually carried out with U.S.
[01:27:56.400 --> 01:27:59.222]  government order to provide a pretext to invade the Middle East.
[01:27:59.222 --> 01:28:05.527]  I don't know, Dick Cheney wrote the PNAC document saying they need a Pearl Harbor-style attack, killing at least 3,000 people.
[01:28:05.527 --> 01:28:06.348]  He even named the number.
[01:28:06.348 --> 01:28:08.890]  I don't know how they got that so accurate.
[01:28:10.251 --> 01:28:13.213]  Somebody died at Pearl Harbor 3000 roughly at a 9-11.
[01:28:13.213 --> 01:28:16.796]  They said a Pearl Harbor size event.
[01:28:16.796 --> 01:28:19.218]  And they said to invade.
[01:28:19.218 --> 01:28:26.324]  The Iranian government has professed on the tongue of its president that it does not believe that Al-Qaeda was behind 9-11, but rather the U.S.
[01:28:26.324 --> 01:28:27.024]  government.
[01:28:27.024 --> 01:28:35.751]  An article reads, so we may ask the question, why would Iran ascribe such a ridiculous belief that stands in the face of logic and evidence?
[01:28:35.751 --> 01:28:36.672]  Totally fed written.
[01:28:38.919 --> 01:28:53.451]  That's funny because any real Al Qaeda, and that's just jihadi fighters out of Saudi Arabia they just put in power in Libya, NATO and our own government did, would know that there are four groups, Western financed, in the last decade
[01:28:54.432 --> 01:29:12.889]  Publicly in the last five years, the White House admitted this under Bush, launching terror attacks in Iran and that, quote, Al-Qaeda are the ones always blowing up a plane with Iranian commanders on it or killing Iranian military people in their military cities.
[01:29:12.889 --> 01:29:18.474]  And then you read and the White House says, yeah, we're using Al-Qaeda to try to overthrow Iran.
[01:29:18.474 --> 01:29:19.315]  And then we see this
[01:29:20.433 --> 01:29:27.878]  Al-Qaeda group saying this I mean it's it's this is written when you read this for the West.
[01:29:27.878 --> 01:29:31.721]  It'd be like if they said yeah the Dallas Redskins were fighting the Washington Cowboys.
[01:29:31.721 --> 01:29:38.406]  I mean for a Middle Easterner or a Central Asian person.
[01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:44.682]  For any of those people, they read this and none of it makes sense.
[01:29:44.682 --> 01:29:48.664]  This is only aimed at ignorant people in the West.
[01:29:48.664 --> 01:29:50.064]  I mean, it's a comic book!
[01:29:50.064 --> 01:29:51.445]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.445 --> 01:29:53.966]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.966 --> 01:29:56.627]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.691 --> 01:30:05.254]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[01:30:05.254 --> 01:30:06.155]  Number one.
[01:30:06.155 --> 01:30:09.598]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:09.598 --> 01:30:10.458]  Number two.
[01:30:10.458 --> 01:30:15.342]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:15.342 --> 01:30:16.082]  It's true.
[01:30:16.082 --> 01:30:20.966]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:20.966 --> 01:30:21.787]  Number three.
[01:30:21.787 --> 01:30:25.369]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:30:25.369 --> 01:30:29.072]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:30:29.272 --> 01:30:32.833]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:30:32.833 --> 01:30:36.514]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:30:36.514 --> 01:30:41.436]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:30:41.436 --> 01:30:46.498]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:30:46.498 --> 01:30:50.659]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:50.659 --> 01:30:52.459]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:52.459 --> 01:30:57.061]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[01:30:57.741 --> 01:31:00.962]  877-327-0365.
[01:31:00.962 --> 01:31:07.605]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:31:07.605 --> 01:31:12.767]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:31:12.767 --> 01:31:21.491]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:31:21.491 --> 01:31:23.832]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:27.482]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[01:31:27.482 --> 01:31:34.570]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[01:31:34.570 --> 01:31:37.633]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[01:31:39.635 --> 01:31:41.776]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:31:41.776 --> 01:31:43.557]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:31:43.557 --> 01:31:46.459]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:31:46.459 --> 01:31:50.682]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[01:31:50.682 --> 01:31:53.084]  So you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:31:53.084 --> 01:31:55.786]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:31:55.786 --> 01:31:57.367]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:31:57.367 --> 01:31:58.147]  Got it.
[01:31:58.147 --> 01:31:59.028]  Others don't.
[01:32:04.433 --> 01:32:05.694]  Tyranny is here.
[01:32:05.694 --> 01:32:09.356]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:32:09.356 --> 01:32:11.857]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:32:11.857 --> 01:32:17.280]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[01:32:17.720 --> 01:32:24.386]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:32:24.386 --> 01:32:30.372]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:32:30.372 --> 01:32:34.055]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:32:34.555 --> 01:32:38.837]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:32:38.837 --> 01:32:44.781]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:32:44.781 --> 01:32:48.342]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:32:48.342 --> 01:32:50.303]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:32:50.303 --> 01:32:51.444]  It's here.

[01:33:00.393 --> 01:33:17.865]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:17.865 --> 01:33:24.209]  Okay, your phone calls are coming up, and then in the next hour I'm going to get into this in detail.
[01:33:24.209 --> 01:33:28.232]  Herman Cain describes Ron Paul supporters' concerns as stupid.
[01:33:29.648 --> 01:33:42.731]  What do you expect for somebody that works for the Federal Reserve in policy, and somebody who wants a national sales tax on top of the income tax, and who supports the Patriot Act, torture, and everything else?
[01:33:42.731 --> 01:33:52.893]  Herman Cain ought to love Obama, but there is the novelty of the fact that he will criticize some of the other Republicans up there.
[01:33:53.749 --> 01:33:57.852]  And the fact is he was designed, just like Rick Perry, to go after Ron Paul.
[01:33:57.852 --> 01:34:09.519]  And so you notice as Rick Perry's star begins to fall, at least for a period of time, they may try to sneak him back out later, Herman Cain now is ahead of Obama in the polls.
[01:34:10.699 --> 01:34:12.580]  One point behind him and others.
[01:34:12.580 --> 01:34:14.941]  Ron Paul is five points ahead.
[01:34:14.941 --> 01:34:19.604]  I covered that poll yesterday in a scientific poll ahead of Obama if the election was held today.
[01:34:19.604 --> 01:34:22.025]  A few points behind him in other polls.
[01:34:22.025 --> 01:34:31.009]  So Ron Paul, Herman Cain, uneducated, uninformed Republicans, you know, think Herman Cain's anti-establishment because they don't know his record yet.
[01:34:31.009 --> 01:34:33.610]  Just like they were uneducated on Rick Perry.
[01:34:33.610 --> 01:34:34.491]  And we're going to educate them.
[01:34:35.347 --> 01:34:39.270]  I mean, I gotta say Herman Cain is not as bad as Rick Perry or Mitt Romney.
[01:34:39.270 --> 01:34:51.258]  I mean, it's hard to support Al Gore and support Hillary Care and both of them, of course, big supporters, and to be for gun control and go to Bilderberg group meetings.
[01:34:51.258 --> 01:34:52.799]  I mean, it's really hard.
[01:34:53.666 --> 01:34:55.168]  But Nerman Cain's better.
[01:34:55.168 --> 01:34:58.831]  He actually works for the very group that Ron Paul's going after.
[01:34:58.831 --> 01:35:03.456]  I mean, it's hard to be as bad as Rick Barrier and Mitt Romney.
[01:35:03.456 --> 01:35:06.098]  That's why the establishment puts them forward as the frontrunners.
[01:35:06.098 --> 01:35:08.040]  Ron Paul, undisputed third place.
[01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:10.543]  As we destroy those two candidates, he will go into first place.
[01:35:10.543 --> 01:35:11.424]  That's coming up.
[01:35:11.424 --> 01:35:15.247]  Also, Jesse Ventura calls for NFL boycott over TSA-style groping.
[01:35:15.247 --> 01:35:16.288]  We've got some good news.
[01:35:16.929 --> 01:35:18.190]  From the NFL.
[01:35:18.190 --> 01:35:23.034]  You know, I called for a boycott a few weeks ago and they announced they're going to start groping our genitals and women's breasts.
[01:35:23.034 --> 01:35:26.757]  We've got some good news announced by the NFL.
[01:35:26.757 --> 01:35:31.220]  Not perfect, but it's some good news showing the power of the boycott.
[01:35:31.220 --> 01:35:34.923]  See, the feds want to bankrupt the airlines and then nationalize it.
[01:35:34.923 --> 01:35:37.586]  So they're more than happy to have a boycott of the airlines.
[01:35:37.586 --> 01:35:40.468]  They just don't want it all at once and they don't want the blame.
[01:35:40.468 --> 01:35:42.870]  But on the subject of
[01:35:45.029 --> 01:35:51.595]  The NFL and shopping malls where you'll get a good groping, a good sexual molestation.
[01:35:51.595 --> 01:35:58.221]  The boycott is king, so we're going to talk about that coming up after I get to some of your calls as this hour ends, as we go into the next hour.
[01:35:58.221 --> 01:35:58.621]  800-259-9031.
[01:35:58.621 --> 01:35:59.802]  All show, it's been confirmed.
[01:36:03.649 --> 01:36:11.273]  The governor of North Carolina was very serious when she said suspend the elections for the economic crisis and that's been batted around.
[01:36:11.273 --> 01:36:16.075]  They have under Bush and now Obama executive orders that we've covered here or for any emergency including
[01:36:17.984 --> 01:36:18.084]  Yeah.
[01:36:48.304 --> 01:36:50.507]  It's a rip-off, but it feels good, doesn't it?
[01:36:50.507 --> 01:36:51.007]  That's all coming up.
[01:37:07.142 --> 01:37:18.833]  And in closing, next hour, I will cover this towards the end of the next hour, and I will have a special on it, a lot of production going into it, to show examples of this tonight on InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:37:18.833 --> 01:37:22.797]  AP labeled racist for accurately transcribing Obama's speech.
[01:37:22.797 --> 01:37:27.462]  Our article went up on Drudge yesterday, red-linked, so we got about a million visitors from that.
[01:37:27.462 --> 01:37:28.903]  Thank you, Drudge, for covering real news.
[01:37:31.220 --> 01:37:35.342]  I'm going to dovetail that with Hillary going to Kentucky talking like a hillbilly.
[01:37:35.342 --> 01:37:36.223]  You remember that.
[01:37:36.223 --> 01:37:41.546]  How about Rick Perry literally trying to talk like Slowpoke Gonzales?
[01:37:41.546 --> 01:37:42.926]  All these politicians do it.
[01:37:42.926 --> 01:37:48.429]  But Obama, when he gets in front of a black audience, starts talking like he's Ice-T or something.
[01:37:48.429 --> 01:37:51.891]  And the AP's being called racist for transcribing what he actually said.
[01:37:51.891 --> 01:37:54.212]  And look, it's not about race.
[01:37:54.212 --> 01:37:57.774]  It's about people playing folks to be fools.
[01:37:57.774 --> 01:37:58.935]  They do it to everybody.
[01:38:00.319 --> 01:38:03.240]  I mean I've seen northerners come down here and put on a Texas accent.
[01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:05.762]  I've seen southerners go up to New York and do it.
[01:38:05.762 --> 01:38:11.444]  It's as if somebody really wants to be talked down to and have their voice changed.
[01:38:11.444 --> 01:38:12.305]  I mean it'd be like if I had a
[01:38:14.702 --> 01:38:26.847]  We got a great guy from China that works here in my office, a programmer, and I don't come over to him and put on some stereotypical affected Asian voice when I talk to him.
[01:38:26.847 --> 01:38:27.647]  I just talk to him.
[01:38:27.647 --> 01:38:28.167]  He's a man.
[01:38:28.167 --> 01:38:29.348]  He's a human being.
[01:38:29.348 --> 01:38:31.609]  I find that insulting.
[01:38:31.609 --> 01:38:36.711]  I've been at Mexican food restaurants with friends before, and a Hispanic waitress brings over food, and they're like,
[01:38:37.325 --> 01:38:38.967]  I would like a taco, please!
[01:38:53.106 --> 01:38:53.946]  Probably four or five months.
[01:38:53.946 --> 01:39:07.749]  He is a sponsor, but the reason I've got him up here today is because he is the oldest and longest continually operated, many claim they are, I've checked, he's the real deal, and the biggest storable foods manufacturer in the United States.
[01:39:07.749 --> 01:39:13.190]  Non-GMO, non-hybrid, and he's making it new every week with giant factories.
[01:39:13.190 --> 01:39:19.812]  You do not want, and I'm not bashing other folks, but I found eFoods over a decade ago looking, because I kept buying
[01:39:20.612 --> 01:39:26.034]  Stuff with additives and crud and MSG and 10 years old repackaged.
[01:39:26.034 --> 01:39:28.875]  This is all fresh, fresh, fresh.
[01:39:28.875 --> 01:39:30.055]  But that's not why he's here.
[01:39:30.055 --> 01:39:31.836]  He's not here to even pitch the food at you.
[01:39:31.836 --> 01:39:38.638]  I wanted to get Steve on for MeFoodsDirect, Steve Schenck, on because we're seeing commodities go up again.
[01:39:38.638 --> 01:39:40.219]  We're seeing the depression loom.
[01:39:40.959 --> 01:39:43.123]  And folks, we need to be prepared.
[01:39:43.123 --> 01:39:44.244]  We need to have affordable food.
[01:39:44.244 --> 01:39:49.953]  But the reason I've got him on is because I promised to have him back up, an update on, because he's buying food a year out.
[01:39:49.953 --> 01:39:51.956]  Food that hadn't grown yet, but in the futures.
[01:39:52.762 --> 01:39:53.583]  Hey, it's good to be aboard, Alex.
[01:40:15.846 --> 01:40:19.308]  You know, I'm ranting about a lot of issues, but all of it ties into food.
[01:40:19.308 --> 01:40:22.089]  Where are you right now with your factories?
[01:40:22.089 --> 01:40:24.831]  I know can package millions of packages a week.
[01:40:24.831 --> 01:40:26.352]  Where are you on the futures?
[01:40:27.759 --> 01:40:38.903]  Well, the problem of the future is we just had this last week, the reason I wanted to get back in touch with you is that we all of a sudden have just an instant jump in some of the basics.
[01:40:38.903 --> 01:40:45.625]  Rice, beans, pasta, the wheat that they make pasta from, as a result of this ethanol thing,
[01:40:48.866 --> 01:40:49.266]  Wow!
[01:40:49.266 --> 01:40:50.888]  Okay, continue to break that down for us.
[01:41:18.885 --> 01:41:28.737]  Well, what happens is when we've got things going on like the stock market, literally the stock market is crashing every other day.
[01:41:28.737 --> 01:41:36.928]  And it's re-crashing, and what that means to the people out there is that companies are going to go under, jobs are going to be lost,
[01:41:37.609 --> 01:41:48.211]  And they won't be able to afford to buy the food that is already too expensive for like 40 million Americans that are on food stamps.
[01:41:48.211 --> 01:42:02.274]  And so, this trend that we're seeing, this perfect storm with the stock market now affecting food prices, with the ethanol and the gas prices affecting food prices, and it's kind of interesting, Alex.
[01:42:02.274 --> 01:42:06.415]  The media came out and is wringing their hands over the shortage of pumpkins.
[01:42:07.654 --> 01:42:23.644]  Well, I hate to tell you this, but the same land that they grow pumpkins on, we actually need the food from, and that's been going downhill, too, because of all the flooding and also the droughts and everything that's going on with food production, not just in America, but worldwide.
[01:42:25.262 --> 01:42:33.865]  The major population centers of the world, China, India, out farming the rest of the planet for anything they can get for food.
[01:42:33.865 --> 01:42:37.287]  And so that's what's causing this immediate jump.
[01:42:37.287 --> 01:42:48.511]  I mean, in one month's time, the pasta grains go up 20%, rice, beans, some of the basics, and then everything else is going up crazy.
[01:42:48.511 --> 01:42:49.872]  But you've been able to keep prices down?
[01:42:49.872 --> 01:42:54.834]  When we tell people that they need to get going at anything that they can do to get in food,
[01:42:55.644 --> 01:43:21.229]  And what we did was we, this is just an aside, we told people to get their orders in because of the free shipping that we've got going on here for a short period of time, but the main thing is people have to look at this and say, we've got to get food in now because exactly what you've been telling people is going to happen, what you and I have talked about, we've got the perfect storm and those prices are starting to just absolutely skyrocket.
[01:43:21.229 --> 01:43:24.290]  We thought they were bad before, now they're absolutely insane.
[01:43:24.810 --> 01:43:34.674]  And Steve, the numbers I've seen are 47 million on full-time food stamps that are high-tech soup lines.
[01:43:34.674 --> 01:43:43.378]  And then if you add in people that have supplemental income to pay for their food, it's over 50 million are on some type of food assistance.
[01:43:43.378 --> 01:43:48.801]  And then if you count the number of children on the school lunch program, in fact, I forget that number.
[01:43:48.801 --> 01:43:50.922]  Guys, pull up school lunch program number of kids on it for me.
[01:43:51.781 --> 01:43:53.603]  It's absolutely insane.
[01:43:53.603 --> 01:43:55.485]  That's my point, Steve.
[01:43:55.485 --> 01:44:07.919]  That's my point here though, Steve, is that we're 300 million people in this country and we're talking about 50 million of them are already in electronic food lines and you've got all this global meltdown happening.
[01:44:08.559 --> 01:44:37.081]  I only promote what I believe in, and I think people need to call efoodsdirect.com or go to efoodsdirect.com's website and get your high-quality, storable food today, because I remember you for years telling listeners, and this stuff lasts more than 10 years, buy the food now before it goes up in price, which it has, and you'll be able to eat the food later and save money and beat inflation, and you've told me off-record that a lot of people call you now and actually are out of work and stuff and are glad that they did buy food from you a few years ago.
[01:44:37.898 --> 01:44:44.202]  Well, and the interesting thing is on the people on food stamps, Alex, those people are not unemployed.
[01:44:44.202 --> 01:44:48.445]  A high percentage of them are fully employed and they still can't afford the food.
[01:44:48.445 --> 01:44:54.029]  So anytime they see any kind of an opportunity, like if there's something like free shipping,
[01:44:54.469 --> 01:44:55.870]  Well, Steve, I've said it over and over again.
[01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:22.543]  A ant colony stores food.
[01:45:22.543 --> 01:45:24.304]  Squirrels store food.
[01:45:24.304 --> 01:45:28.908]  Wolves will bury part of the kill they don't eat in the snow and come back a month later and eat it.
[01:45:28.908 --> 01:45:32.491]  It is a fundamental instinct to save food.
[01:45:32.491 --> 01:45:35.234]  My grandparents did it on both sides.
[01:45:35.234 --> 01:45:43.982]  And in the Great Depression, major universities estimate 7 million people died of malnutrition and starvation over that decade.
[01:45:45.409 --> 01:45:48.853]  90% of people lived in rural areas and were somewhat self-sufficient.
[01:45:48.853 --> 01:45:51.576]  Now 90%, right at 90, are urban.
[01:45:51.576 --> 01:45:54.859]  In fact, I saw a number last month that's down 91% are urban.
[01:45:54.859 --> 01:45:59.825]  So only 9% are on the land and half of those are self-sufficient.
[01:45:59.825 --> 01:46:05.150]  We are on top of an incredible time bomb and I hope we dodge this bullet, and we may.
[01:46:05.771 --> 01:46:07.933]  But for a lot of people, they haven't already.
[01:46:07.933 --> 01:46:09.534]  It is important to get storable food.
[01:46:09.534 --> 01:46:14.497]  And for those that don't know, one of the biggest costs of storable food is the shipping.
[01:46:14.497 --> 01:46:20.961]  Even if you buy it at a local place, it still had to be shipped there, unless you can drive to where it's produced and pick it up there.
[01:46:20.961 --> 01:46:23.043]  And this is even better than that.
[01:46:23.043 --> 01:46:26.445]  This is free shipping, which is a giant savings.
[01:46:26.445 --> 01:46:33.110]  Steve, tell folks about, in the last few minutes we've got, some of the different food plans you've got and the type of high-quality food we're talking about here.
[01:46:34.363 --> 01:46:38.826]  Well, people can work with small amounts, whatever they need.
[01:46:38.826 --> 01:46:41.888]  They can work with a three-month supply, a six-month supply.
[01:46:41.888 --> 01:46:56.097]  A lot of folks are working with the year's supplies, but one of the most important things for folks right now are what we call the new traversal foods that come in little pouches that all they have to do is boil water.
[01:46:56.097 --> 01:46:57.678]  A ten-year-old can fix all this food.
[01:46:58.418 --> 01:46:58.878]  I think so.
[01:47:16.265 --> 01:47:32.713]  And the fact is that people can put together whatever they can and put in a savings account on food that literally with what's happening with precious metals and things, people are moving from cash to precious metals and from precious metals to food right now.
[01:47:32.713 --> 01:47:39.657]  That's the way things are going and that's the way that the world is forcing people to be just for security.
[01:47:40.495 --> 01:47:48.218]  Well, people need firearms, they need emergency equipment, emergency radios, they need food, they need water filters.
[01:47:48.218 --> 01:47:50.218]  It's very simple.
[01:47:50.218 --> 01:47:56.701]  We need to learn to not be dependent on government because government has proven in history it can't and it won't
[01:47:57.321 --> 01:48:05.326]  Protect you and government itself, as you know, Steve, has been buying up most of the food, the emergency supplies out there, driving up the prices.
[01:48:05.326 --> 01:48:09.809]  The government is acting like they're digging in for Armageddon.
[01:48:09.809 --> 01:48:12.071]  We know it's the financial collapse.
[01:48:12.671 --> 01:48:14.091]  And so it's so important.
[01:48:14.091 --> 01:48:15.311]  It's a win-win-win.
[01:48:15.311 --> 01:48:23.273]  Your sponsorship helps us get out the general word and information, and also then helps educate people about high-quality, storable foods.
[01:48:23.273 --> 01:48:26.513]  And then they also aren't dependent on the system.
[01:48:26.513 --> 01:48:27.494]  It's so important.
[01:48:27.494 --> 01:48:34.875]  So the website is E, the letter E, foodsdirect.com, big banners at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:48:34.875 --> 01:48:40.056]  And there's also the toll-free number that's up on screen for prisonplanet.tv viewers.
[01:48:40.056 --> 01:48:41.016]  For radio listeners, it's 800
[01:48:42.056 --> 01:48:42.136]  800-876-0871.
[01:48:42.136 --> 01:48:42.196]  800-876-0871.
[01:48:42.196 --> 01:48:44.320]  Is that the best phone number to give out, Steve?
[01:48:52.659 --> 01:48:54.661]  That's absolutely wonderful.
[01:48:54.661 --> 01:48:55.241]  That's perfect.
[01:49:12.734 --> 01:49:14.237]  to get the free shipping.
[01:49:14.237 --> 01:49:20.827]  eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex or tell them it's the radio special when you call the number to get the free shipping.
[01:49:20.827 --> 01:49:24.353]  What type of value are we talking about on the free shipping with the different packages, Steve?
[01:49:25.680 --> 01:49:42.108]  Well, a lot of times people are saving literally hundreds of dollars because shipping has become, as a result of the ethanol and the gas push and the cost of shipping, shipping oftentimes becomes 10 or 15 percent of the value that people are ordering.
[01:49:42.108 --> 01:49:46.390]  And it's just absolutely insane that people have to spend so much on shipping just to get the food there.
[01:49:47.074 --> 01:49:57.159]  800-876-0871 or eFoodsDirect, one word, letter eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex or Alejandro.
[01:49:57.159 --> 01:50:00.160]  Again, eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:08.444]  Steve Schenck, I look forward to speaking to you again in the near future and hopefully the commodity prices do not continue to go up.
[01:50:08.444 --> 01:50:10.885]  I know you haven't had a price increase in a long time.
[01:50:10.885 --> 01:50:12.686]  Are you going to have to have a price increase soon?
[01:50:14.900 --> 01:50:21.884]  We're working right now on inventories that we have contracted to keep the price down.
[01:50:21.884 --> 01:50:28.469]  I know we'll be forced to fairly soon, but the biggest thing is right now, we've got the inventories.
[01:50:28.469 --> 01:50:32.812]  People really need to get everything they can get their hands on right now while they can still afford it.
[01:50:33.154 --> 01:50:33.794]  They certainly do.
[01:50:33.794 --> 01:50:34.995]  Thank you, Steve Schenck.
[01:50:34.995 --> 01:50:35.756]  All right, folks.
[01:50:35.756 --> 01:50:37.017]  I just wanted to have Steve check in.
[01:50:37.017 --> 01:50:39.078]  I haven't been on this in about four months.
[01:50:39.078 --> 01:50:46.924]  Now that I think about it, I want to come back to your phone calls and see where that takes us on the other side of this quick break.
[01:50:46.924 --> 01:50:53.249]  Then we're going to get into the latest on Election 2012, the economy, and a lot more.
[01:50:53.249 --> 01:50:59.973]  But first up, when we get back, we're going to talk to Lone Star Diva, Reverend Bruce, Dave, Nick, CJ, and others.
[01:51:00.794 --> 01:51:04.776]  Hey guys, are weaker testosterone levels taking you out of the game?

[01:53:01.016 --> 01:53:04.559]  Smokers, are you still smoking traditional cigarettes?
[01:53:04.559 --> 01:53:10.585]  Are you still smelling up your clothes and car interior, staining your teeth, and getting ashes everywhere?
[01:53:10.585 --> 01:53:11.245]  Why?
[01:53:11.245 --> 01:53:15.569]  When you could be smoking or vaping with e-cigarettes by Le Cig.

[01:54:04.138 --> 01:54:15.580]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:15.580 --> 01:54:21.842]  You notice Herman Cain was in the single digits, 4 or 5 percentage points.
[01:54:23.419 --> 01:54:27.722]  Until Ron Paul began to power surge and Perry began to fade.
[01:54:27.722 --> 01:54:29.624]  In comes Kane.
[01:54:29.624 --> 01:54:32.526]  Now he can beat Obama, we're told.
[01:54:32.526 --> 01:54:34.227]  Why, he's the man.
[01:54:34.227 --> 01:54:38.551]  So he can then fade off later and Obama will end up getting in there.
[01:54:38.551 --> 01:54:42.213]  Turns out he's backed by Skull and Bones, put on the Federal Reserve Board.
[01:54:42.213 --> 01:54:45.596]  High-powered globalist.
[01:54:45.596 --> 01:54:49.519]  And so we're going to be at the bottom of the next hour talking about Herman Cain coming up.
[01:54:49.519 --> 01:54:51.921]  Lone star diva in Texas.
[01:54:51.921 --> 01:54:52.641]  You're on the air.
[01:54:52.641 --> 01:54:53.002]  Welcome.
[01:54:54.262 --> 01:54:57.144]  Hi Alex, I haven't talked to you in a few years.
[01:54:57.144 --> 01:55:11.014]  I have beat my brains against the wall for two months and I've come up with your kind of call to action to do something and I've come up with a simple action list to become a delegate and this is really the only way to get Ron Paul on the presidential ticket.
[01:55:11.014 --> 01:55:16.238]  Absolutely, the devil's in the details and that's where the globalists get us so we've got to get into the details.
[01:55:17.133 --> 01:55:22.936]  Okay, I've emailed this to you and your team, and I've also made a little video for YouTube that goes over this.
[01:55:22.936 --> 01:55:25.557]  It's five points, I can read them off fairly quickly.
[01:55:25.557 --> 01:55:26.738]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:55:26.738 --> 01:55:33.161]  Listen, people are used to call screeners, so what happens is people call me and then want me to screen their call on air.
[01:55:33.161 --> 01:55:35.201]  Just go ahead and hit the points.
[01:55:35.201 --> 01:55:40.964]  Okay, number one, be registered to vote 30 days prior to your primary election.
[01:55:40.964 --> 01:55:42.305]  Ours in Texas is March 6th.
[01:55:43.408 --> 01:55:44.568]  Vote in the primary.
[01:55:44.568 --> 01:55:47.629]  Make sure they stamp your voter registration card.
[01:55:47.629 --> 01:55:53.991]  And also check for a listing on the wall at the poll when you go to vote for when the convention committee meets.
[01:55:53.991 --> 01:55:56.632]  And it'll be that night, probably.
[01:55:56.632 --> 01:56:01.833]  Number three, go back that night when the polls close for the meeting, which is usually at 7 p.m.
[01:56:01.833 --> 01:56:02.194]  now.
[01:56:02.194 --> 01:56:07.495]  And they may have posted that it's otherwise, but it has to be within, I think, five days now.
[01:56:07.495 --> 01:56:09.896]  Four, attend the precinct convention.
[01:56:10.771 --> 01:56:12.432]  That night, 7 p.m.
[01:56:12.432 --> 01:56:15.755]  It could only be you or up to 100 people, depending on the size of your precinct.
[01:56:15.755 --> 01:56:29.924]  Number five, and I have a footnote with this one, choose fellow Ron Paul supporters when voting for the precinct chair, secretary, sergeant-at-arms, and most importantly, the delegate to the county convention and their alternate.
[01:56:29.924 --> 01:56:34.468]  Number six, you've got to follow through and attend the conventions you're selected for, even if you're just an alternate.
[01:56:34.468 --> 01:56:37.530]  It's going to cost you a three-day stay in a hotel, so start saving now.
[01:56:38.004 --> 01:56:42.566]  The best way it should be is just say, folks, get out there and be Ron Paul delegates.
[01:56:42.566 --> 01:56:42.787]  Okay?
[01:56:42.787 --> 01:56:48.170]  And then serious people that actually want to try to save this country and the world are going to go out and find out.
[01:56:48.170 --> 01:56:49.270]  But that is very exciting.
[01:56:49.270 --> 01:56:52.472]  I appreciate your call.
[01:56:52.472 --> 01:56:54.873]  Let's go ahead and go to another caller here.
[01:56:54.873 --> 01:56:57.314]  I want to go quickly through these.
[01:56:57.314 --> 01:57:04.738]  Let's talk to Nick, who's listening on KOMY 1340 AM in California.
[01:57:04.738 --> 01:57:05.339]  Welcome, Nick.
[01:57:07.014 --> 01:57:11.216]  I suppose it's flat-earth to not report on Ron Paul.
[01:57:11.216 --> 01:57:20.140]  That's the way it's portraying to me as these network guys are not saying him, they might as well be taken off like a piece of cardboard.
[01:57:20.140 --> 01:57:34.026]  No, and he's given the least amount of time in questions and in answers, in the debates, and when they do talk about him they say he can't win, which shows you he's the guy to vote for.
[01:57:34.026 --> 01:57:35.227]  You know, talking about comics?
[01:57:36.676 --> 01:57:43.823]  Um, when you first introduced Dewhurst to me, he was overriding some TSA bill.
[01:57:43.823 --> 01:57:46.305]  Um, immediately... Alex, you there?
[01:57:46.305 --> 01:57:47.506]  Yes, sir.
[01:57:47.506 --> 01:57:51.509]  Um, I put him on a tip of the iceberg.
[01:57:51.509 --> 01:57:57.074]  And immediately, as I'm 52 years old, I put Bob Dole frozen inside the bottom part.
[01:57:57.074 --> 01:57:57.615]  His error.
[01:57:59.810 --> 01:58:05.394]  He's the guy you've been talking about all morning about nobody did anything about.
[01:58:05.394 --> 01:58:10.278]  And now we're in consequential... How he could even know?
[01:58:10.278 --> 01:58:21.466]  What we do, you know, is go back not a hundred years like Naomi says, and study their actions, but just study the overrides of the last three decades.
[01:58:21.466 --> 01:58:27.291]  And this guy has been the greatest Sand Creek Indian killer of our time.
[01:58:28.735 --> 01:58:30.996]  Alright man, I think I understood most of that.
[01:58:30.996 --> 01:58:33.237]  Interesting points.
[01:58:33.237 --> 01:58:41.461]  Either that's complex geometry poetry or I'm a turkey.
[01:58:41.461 --> 01:58:44.983]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:58:50.886 --> 01:58:52.927]  Hello, this is Steve Shank with an urgent update.
[01:58:58.404 --> 01:59:07.006]  The Food Direct has been doing all we can this year to help you get food before the perfect storm of exploding food prices from the 2011 harvest.
[01:59:07.006 --> 01:59:11.827]  During September, eFoods is giving you free shipping on your food supply orders.
[01:59:11.827 --> 01:59:15.948]  But you have to understand we're entering the eye of the food cost storm.
[01:59:15.948 --> 01:59:22.829]  Ethanol is boosting gas prices and driving corn costs so high our wheat for bread is going into animal feed.
[01:59:23.229 --> 01:59:26.311]  And pasta wheat cost has doubled since last year.
[01:59:26.311 --> 01:59:31.475]  I strongly advise you to get your order in before the free shipping deadline, September 30th.
[01:59:31.475 --> 01:59:35.497]  Free shipping, including Alaska and Hawaii, ends September 30th.

[02:00:17.746 --> 02:00:21.809]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:31.522 --> 02:00:34.984]  Okay, we are now into our number three.
[02:00:34.984 --> 02:00:43.849]  Aaron Dice is going to pop in and talk about the enforcer for the Pillsbury Skull and Bones Minionship of the New World Order.
[02:00:43.849 --> 02:00:47.211]  I'm talking about Herman Cain.
[02:00:47.211 --> 02:00:52.875]  Also, it's pretty big news that Jesse Ventura announced here he would like to run as the VP with Ron Paul.
[02:00:53.772 --> 02:00:54.973]  That's a pretty big deal.
[02:00:54.973 --> 02:00:56.153]  Pretty newsworthy.
[02:00:56.153 --> 02:00:57.954]  That article's up at InfoWars.com.
[02:00:57.954 --> 02:01:02.556]  Former governor calls for Paul Ventura ticket.
[02:01:02.556 --> 02:01:03.196]  I'm gonna get into that.
[02:01:03.196 --> 02:01:04.977]  It's gonna be a jam-packed third hour.
[02:01:04.977 --> 02:01:08.998]  But right now, let's continue with your ring-a-dingies.
[02:01:08.998 --> 02:01:11.679]  Let's talk to Reverend Bruce in New York.
[02:01:11.679 --> 02:01:12.920]  Come on down, Reverend.
[02:01:15.262 --> 02:01:19.508]  God bless you, my wonderful radio personality.
[02:01:19.508 --> 02:01:21.671]  I still keep you in prayer for safety.
[02:01:21.671 --> 02:01:22.172]  Well, thank you.
[02:01:22.172 --> 02:01:23.113]  I need those prayers.
[02:01:23.113 --> 02:01:25.096]  I covet them.
[02:01:25.096 --> 02:01:25.497]  All right.
[02:01:25.497 --> 02:01:29.202]  I just have a couple of questions and a couple of comments, and I'll be brief.
[02:01:29.202 --> 02:01:29.963]  The first thing is,
[02:01:31.284 --> 02:01:45.835]  Are you thinking about even considering that whenever the Bilderbergs are in town or close by like neighboring Canada or somewhere here that you get a bus together and get some folks like me and other people to come with you to rally in front of those meetings?
[02:01:46.277 --> 02:01:48.139]  That's a good idea if we had the money.
[02:01:48.139 --> 02:01:51.742]  We do have an RV now, but it didn't really set up like a bus.
[02:01:51.742 --> 02:01:55.846]  The problem is I spent all my time trying to raise the money to pay for this operation.
[02:01:55.846 --> 02:02:03.754]  They don't have any time to actually go on the trips themselves, but I'm working on at least every two months going to three or four cities.
[02:02:03.754 --> 02:02:07.978]  A, because I want to meet people and get the word out that way, and B, I never get out of Austin.
[02:02:09.099 --> 02:02:17.401]  So we're working on that right now, and yes, if I can get into Canada, because they are set to, every four years it's in North America, but they split it.
[02:02:17.401 --> 02:02:19.981]  It'll be in Canada one year, every four years.
[02:02:19.981 --> 02:02:21.242]  It's only in the U.S.
[02:02:21.242 --> 02:02:23.942]  to be technical every eight years.
[02:02:23.942 --> 02:02:34.125]  And four years ago, when Obama was being selected, or three and a half years ago, it was in Virginia, in Chantilly, and I was there.
[02:02:34.125 --> 02:02:35.285]  So if it's in Canada,
[02:02:36.824 --> 02:02:54.374]  I am going to have to probably not even announce I'm going and then probably try to get in on the west side of Canada even though the east side is where they'll meet because I've confirmed in the French Canada I'm in the computer band and I've learned that if you get banned there federally that the
[02:02:55.626 --> 02:02:57.647]  But they'll still let you in on the west side.
[02:02:57.647 --> 02:02:58.347]  It's very weird.
[02:02:58.347 --> 02:03:02.048]  I'm told it's more English style.
[02:03:02.048 --> 02:03:03.169]  I'm not bashing the French.
[02:03:03.169 --> 02:03:13.792]  I'm not a Francophobe like a lot of people, but I mean, they are famous in France and in other French protectorates of just being really mean at customs.
[02:03:13.792 --> 02:03:18.014]  And I am in their database and do not want to experience 15 hours of being cussed out again.
[02:03:18.014 --> 02:03:18.554]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:03:19.537 --> 02:03:22.399]  Well, if you were to get a bus, people would pay.
[02:03:22.399 --> 02:03:23.859]  You know, like you got a bus trip.
[02:03:23.859 --> 02:03:24.740]  You know, it's good.
[02:03:24.740 --> 02:03:30.223]  People can get buses, get a bus trip, pay for their own tickets, their own way, and meet you there.
[02:03:30.223 --> 02:03:32.184]  I mean, it's something... No, I agree.
[02:03:32.184 --> 02:03:33.344]  Listen, I tried it.
[02:03:33.344 --> 02:03:38.467]  This year, we said March on Bilderberg, and I'm told about 500 people showed up, and they did St.
[02:03:38.467 --> 02:03:43.490]  Moritz that was in the middle of nowhere, you know, in the fog-trouted Alps.
[02:03:44.290 --> 02:03:45.571]  Okay, my next thing, my comment is this.
[02:04:08.624 --> 02:04:22.772]  Have you considered about, because it's hard to get through to you on the phone, having like a live Twitter, people could tweet you questions or even on your own web page have a live tweet so you can answer questions from live tweets?
[02:04:23.254 --> 02:04:24.015]  You know what?
[02:04:24.015 --> 02:04:31.361]  We're talking about doing a mailbag segment from emails and tweets every night on the news, nightly news, and here.
[02:04:31.361 --> 02:04:33.663]  But I would have to be organized then, and then I'm not very organized.
[02:04:33.663 --> 02:04:36.606]  Not my crew's fault, mainly my fault.
[02:04:36.606 --> 02:04:38.467]  And I have done live chats before.
[02:04:38.467 --> 02:04:42.010]  I post a tweet, 20 people comment in like a minute.
[02:04:42.010 --> 02:04:44.152]  So even if I do that, it'd be hard to answer the questions.
[02:04:44.152 --> 02:04:44.733]  But I'll tell you what.
[02:04:45.646 --> 02:04:54.476]  Twitter me some questions right now at realalexjones.com forward slash, no it's twitter.com forward slash Alex Jones.
[02:04:54.476 --> 02:04:56.198]  Alright, thank you.
[02:04:56.198 --> 02:04:57.520]  Whatever.
[02:04:57.520 --> 02:04:59.662]  Twitter.com forward slash realalexjones.
[02:04:59.662 --> 02:05:00.163]  What did I say?
[02:05:01.067 --> 02:05:02.248]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:05:02.248 --> 02:05:09.172]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:05:09.172 --> 02:05:11.714]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:05:11.714 --> 02:05:17.117]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:05:17.117 --> 02:05:20.139]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:05:20.139 --> 02:05:22.460]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:05:22.460 --> 02:05:28.364]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:05:28.704 --> 02:05:32.087]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:05:32.087 --> 02:05:37.873]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:05:37.873 --> 02:05:39.514]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:05:39.514 --> 02:05:40.815]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:05:40.815 --> 02:05:43.478]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:05:43.478 --> 02:05:47.702]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:05:47.702 --> 02:05:50.384]  You can find the video at www.barronjones.com
[02:05:50.504 --> 02:05:52.308]  End of America 3.com.
[02:05:52.308 --> 02:05:54.913]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[02:05:54.913 --> 02:05:58.781]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:05:58.781 --> 02:05:59.863]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:06.702]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[02:06:06.702 --> 02:06:13.124]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[02:06:13.124 --> 02:06:15.405]  Number one, study the past.
[02:06:15.405 --> 02:06:17.806]  History really does repeat itself.
[02:06:17.806 --> 02:06:21.528]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[02:06:22.648 --> 02:06:25.750]  Number three, take decisive action.
[02:06:25.750 --> 02:06:29.593]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[02:06:29.593 --> 02:06:34.637]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[02:06:34.637 --> 02:06:38.639]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[02:06:38.639 --> 02:06:42.042]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[02:06:42.042 --> 02:06:45.684]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:06:46.525 --> 02:06:51.470]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[02:06:51.470 --> 02:06:56.095]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:06:56.095 --> 02:06:58.778]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:07:01.542 --> 02:07:05.566]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:07:05.566 --> 02:07:08.810]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:07:08.810 --> 02:07:14.376]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:07:14.376 --> 02:07:20.002]  Tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:07:20.002 --> 02:07:22.245]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:07:22.765 --> 02:07:23.065]  Tim Geithner?
[02:07:23.065 --> 02:07:23.325]  Bernanke?
[02:07:23.325 --> 02:07:23.946]  They're arsonists!
[02:07:23.946 --> 02:07:24.706]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:07:24.706 --> 02:07:25.727]  And the Congress is saying...
[02:07:40.475 --> 02:07:41.676]  Who do we make the check out to?
[02:07:41.676 --> 02:07:43.796]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:07:43.796 --> 02:07:48.958]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[02:07:48.958 --> 02:08:01.404]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:08:01.404 --> 02:08:06.966]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:22.188 --> 02:08:23.889]  Okay, we got a lot of breaking news.
[02:08:23.889 --> 02:08:26.351]  I'm going to break down on Herman Cain.
[02:08:26.351 --> 02:08:30.454]  We're going to have Aaron Dyson here give you a boil down on him at the bottom of the hour.
[02:08:30.454 --> 02:08:36.839]  We're also going to get into former Governor Jesse Ventura calls for a Paul Ventura ticket.
[02:08:36.839 --> 02:08:50.729]  And he agreed with me that if Ron Paul doesn't win, which he has a really good chance of doing, despite all the hoaxing and skullduggery and scams that are going on, the tomfoolery, that if he doesn't win the Republican nomination,
[02:08:51.874 --> 02:08:51.934]  And
[02:09:08.823 --> 02:09:09.924]  I don't know.
[02:09:32.079 --> 02:09:46.973]  Ron Paul is not allowed to ride off in the sunset despite all his hard work if he loses this and then he goes off to be the kind of the omnibudsman or the honorable Gandalf type advisor to the Liberty Movement.
[02:09:46.973 --> 02:09:52.559]  We need him to go in through and beyond and go into that debate.
[02:09:54.295 --> 02:09:57.457]  Go into that general election.
[02:09:57.457 --> 02:09:59.798]  And I am saying draft him now.
[02:09:59.798 --> 02:10:01.659]  Now this gets misunderstood, this gets spun.
[02:10:01.659 --> 02:10:09.483]  I saw articles last night and emails I got going, Alex Jones is saying Ron Paul should drop out of the Republican Party and should run as Libertarian.
[02:10:09.483 --> 02:10:12.345]  That is not what I'm saying.
[02:10:12.345 --> 02:10:14.126]  That is, repeat, not what I'm saying.
[02:10:14.126 --> 02:10:21.150]  Jesse Ventura is so sick of the two parties and was able to beat them in Minnesota, which was a real upset back in 98 as you know.
[02:10:22.714 --> 02:10:26.818]  That he's in love with the idea of Alex, the two parties.
[02:10:26.818 --> 02:10:29.420]  It's a two-party dictatorship, Alex.
[02:10:29.420 --> 02:10:30.781]  And I see his point.
[02:10:30.781 --> 02:10:37.347]  But to use the apparatus of the Republican Party, the primary system, Ron Paul's doing the right thing.
[02:10:37.347 --> 02:10:41.151]  If there was a guy running as a Democrat like Ron Paul, I'd be a Democrat supporting him.
[02:10:42.634 --> 02:10:50.221]  Yes, the parties are a joke at the federal level, with anybody else but Ron Paul and a few others, but he's a real guy.
[02:10:50.221 --> 02:10:52.683]  So, stay in, try to win.
[02:10:54.246 --> 02:10:56.748]  He would be the frontrunner of all these dirty tricks.
[02:10:56.748 --> 02:10:59.970]  We can take out the other two candidates politically with the issues we have.
[02:10:59.970 --> 02:11:02.893]  Look at Perry, already falling behind.
[02:11:02.893 --> 02:11:04.894]  Up comes Herman Cain.
[02:11:04.894 --> 02:11:06.175]  What did Perry do?
[02:11:06.175 --> 02:11:08.637]  Perry tried to become a Ron Paul clone.
[02:11:08.637 --> 02:11:13.821]  Blew up in his face even worse, because not only was he not a Ron Paul, but he was the opposite.
[02:11:14.929 --> 02:11:17.250]  That's, and then Perry could come back again.
[02:11:17.250 --> 02:11:25.914]  He's kind of out of the spotlight now because of the trouncing and the open borders promotion and the carbon taxes and the Al Gore and Hillary Care loving.
[02:11:25.914 --> 02:11:29.876]  All of that hurt him bad, but we have all that on Mitt Romney as well.
[02:11:29.876 --> 02:11:31.177]  That's how bad these guys are.
[02:11:31.177 --> 02:11:32.197]  Of course they're globalist.
[02:11:32.197 --> 02:11:34.278]  I mean, who is the media promoting?
[02:11:34.278 --> 02:11:39.161]  So now they're sending in a Herman Cain to imitate Ron Paul.
[02:11:39.161 --> 02:11:41.222]  Now he isn't, he doesn't have as much dirt.
[02:11:42.930 --> 02:11:58.515]  He doesn't have as much dirt as McCain, you know, did four years ago, or as somebody like a Mitt Romney today, or a Rudolph Giuliani.
[02:11:58.515 --> 02:12:02.036]  I mean, those guys are all jokes from the past, or a Newt Gingrich.
[02:12:02.036 --> 02:12:05.977]  But he's still bad news, and that's coming up after some calls.
[02:12:05.977 --> 02:12:08.698]  Regardless, though, here's what I'm saying.
[02:12:08.698 --> 02:12:10.619]  If Ron Paul doesn't get that nomination,
[02:12:11.693 --> 02:12:20.757]  I will guarantee you, I will guarantee you he can form the Liberty Party.
[02:12:20.757 --> 02:12:23.879]  Or if he wanted to, if the Libertarians have it chosen there.
[02:12:23.879 --> 02:12:32.963]  Hey, look up when they have the Libertarian Presidential Caucus, when they have that big event and pick their presidential candidate with their delegates.
[02:12:32.963 --> 02:12:35.664]  Look up when they did that in 2008 for me.
[02:12:35.664 --> 02:12:37.345]  When do the Libertarians choose Bob Barr?
[02:12:40.746 --> 02:12:42.887]  Because I meant to look that up last night.
[02:12:42.887 --> 02:12:47.089]  The point is, I know it comes later than the beginning of the general primaries and caucuses.
[02:12:47.089 --> 02:13:02.317]  So, if it isn't looking good for Ron Paul in March, and he starts going to these other states, and they're announcing, in Texas, Ron Paul only got 20% of the votes, which you know it's a fraud if that happens.
[02:13:02.317 --> 02:13:06.359]  This guy is elected by the biggest margin of anybody in Congress from Texas.
[02:13:06.359 --> 02:13:07.220]  It's 80-something percent.
[02:13:08.865 --> 02:13:10.346]  In the old days, it was 60-something.
[02:13:10.346 --> 02:13:14.150]  He got, I think it was 81%, some ridiculous number.
[02:13:14.150 --> 02:13:16.191]  If it wasn't the last time, the time before.
[02:13:16.191 --> 02:13:23.818]  If he doesn't win and smash Rick Perry... Rick Perry, the last two times, has not gone elected in a two-way race.
[02:13:23.818 --> 02:13:26.840]  He has to have three ways to win.
[02:13:26.840 --> 02:13:36.569]  A split, bifurcated, or I guess the word you'd use is... The point is, he can't win that way.
[02:13:37.898 --> 02:13:39.785]  Rick Perry Show.
[02:13:39.785 --> 02:13:42.133]  I expect if there's not massive election fraud.
[02:13:43.306 --> 02:13:46.048]  Or Ron Paul to be a major contender.
[02:13:46.048 --> 02:13:47.849]  But we know there's going to be the fraud.
[02:13:47.849 --> 02:13:50.792]  So we stay in the game by bringing up the real issues.
[02:13:50.792 --> 02:13:57.877]  He runs as a Libertarian, or if they don't want him, or that's already chosen, as the new Liberty Party.
[02:13:57.877 --> 02:14:05.342]  And Ron Paul gives him a big run to add real issues and to represent America and our constitutional ideas.
[02:14:05.342 --> 02:14:06.243]  That's what I want.
[02:14:06.243 --> 02:14:11.147]  I'm going to be putting articles out the next week or so at InfoWars.com, PrisonPlan.com, promoting that.
[02:14:11.607 --> 02:14:15.788]  We need to stay focused now on the Republican primaries.
[02:14:15.788 --> 02:14:29.973]  But we need to increase our financial giving and spreading the word, but also getting the idea going that, hey, if Ron Paul doesn't even win this primary, or if he starts losing, doesn't matter.
[02:14:29.973 --> 02:14:33.594]  We're going to get him to run as a third party.
[02:14:33.594 --> 02:14:36.415]  That way everybody doesn't get dejected and freaked out.
[02:14:36.415 --> 02:14:39.296]  If he doesn't win, everybody's ready to go to plan B.
[02:14:40.387 --> 02:14:43.288]  Which is Operation Inject the Truth.
[02:14:43.288 --> 02:14:48.250]  Now obviously Ron Paul can't come out and do this now, or they'll say, you're not even really a Republican, why are you even up here?
[02:14:48.250 --> 02:14:52.772]  Which they've already tried to do, they tried to keep him out of debates last time, and this time saying he's not a Republican.
[02:14:52.772 --> 02:14:56.434]  You're not pro-war and pro-torture, and you don't want to bankrupt the country!
[02:14:56.434 --> 02:14:58.935]  You're actually like a founding father in your positions!
[02:14:58.935 --> 02:15:02.116]  You're not fit to be one of us, scum!
[02:15:02.116 --> 02:15:03.517]  You're too good to be one of us, well...
[02:15:05.350 --> 02:15:07.691]  You're not a skull and bones minion like Herman Cain.
[02:15:07.691 --> 02:15:08.831]  Get out of here!
[02:15:08.831 --> 02:15:15.413]  So, he'll have to wait, but we should start building that idea now, so that if Ron Paul chooses, that happens.
[02:15:15.413 --> 02:15:19.654]  Or, some other candidate, at that time, gets ready to jump in.
[02:15:19.654 --> 02:15:23.416]  We're still a year and a half out, or a little less, from the election.
[02:15:23.416 --> 02:15:28.017]  Did you guys find out when they selected the Libertarians, our last presidential candidate, Bob Barr?
[02:15:30.848 --> 02:15:31.468]  That's weird.
[02:15:31.468 --> 02:15:37.632]  Just look at the Libertarian Party website when they hold their caucus.
[02:15:37.632 --> 02:15:39.073]  July 3rd to 7th.
[02:15:39.073 --> 02:15:43.355]  Wow, that gives us a long time then if Ron Paul doesn't win in these primaries.
[02:15:43.355 --> 02:15:43.895]  There you go.
[02:15:43.895 --> 02:15:45.256]  That's what I thought.
[02:15:45.256 --> 02:15:46.717]  I thought it was in the summer.
[02:15:46.717 --> 02:15:48.018]  So, there you go.
[02:15:48.018 --> 02:15:49.819]  He doesn't win the big states in March.
[02:15:51.038 --> 02:16:02.242]  He just activates the Liberty Committee, activates all that money, the money will pour in, and we're off to the races, and he can make what we saw happen with Ross Perot look like nothing.
[02:16:02.242 --> 02:16:03.723]  I'm telling you.
[02:16:03.723 --> 02:16:05.003]  I'm telling you.
[02:16:05.003 --> 02:16:06.884]  That's where we need to go with this.
[02:16:06.884 --> 02:16:12.226]  I normally stay out of Ron Paul's business of just supporting, but, you know, you've heard me on air telling him, you gotta run, you gotta run.
[02:16:12.226 --> 02:16:13.526]  You heard me tell Rand Paul.
[02:16:13.526 --> 02:16:15.687]  I told Rand Paul privately, I said, you're gonna win, buddy boy.
[02:16:17.125 --> 02:16:17.886]  He's like, I don't know.
[02:16:17.886 --> 02:16:19.207]  At least we'll be able to bring up real issues.
[02:16:19.207 --> 02:16:20.368]  And I said, no.
[02:16:20.368 --> 02:16:22.569]  You build it, they will come.
[02:16:22.569 --> 02:16:25.512]  They took some arm-twisting by myself and many others.
[02:16:25.512 --> 02:16:26.212]  Yeah, there it is.
[02:16:26.212 --> 02:16:30.496]  The Libertarian National Convention is scheduled to be held in Las Vegas May 4th and 6th.
[02:16:30.496 --> 02:16:32.277]  They moved it back a month earlier.
[02:16:32.277 --> 02:16:32.797]  So let me see.
[02:16:32.797 --> 02:16:34.078]  March, April, May.
[02:16:34.078 --> 02:16:35.439]  So we got two months there.
[02:16:35.439 --> 02:16:37.781]  No problemo!
[02:16:37.781 --> 02:16:39.343]  Ron Paul in March.
[02:16:40.424 --> 02:16:40.885]  Are you kidding?
[02:16:57.669 --> 02:16:58.129]  I don't think so.
[02:17:19.861 --> 02:17:22.622]  A real expert on this is Richard Reeves.
[02:17:22.622 --> 02:17:25.944]  He's been a delegate and everything else and a grassroots fighter.
[02:17:25.944 --> 02:17:29.306]  In fact, I want him in the last five minutes of the show today to give me his take on this.
[02:17:29.306 --> 02:17:30.866]  I haven't even brought this up to him yet.
[02:17:30.866 --> 02:17:33.228]  I've been thinking about it for months, but now we're getting into the zone here.
[02:17:33.228 --> 02:17:34.308]  Okay, I'm going to shut up.
[02:17:34.308 --> 02:17:37.169]  Let's go to your calls here.
[02:17:37.169 --> 02:17:39.551]  Who's up next?
[02:17:39.551 --> 02:17:40.631]  CJ in Michigan.
[02:17:40.631 --> 02:17:41.251]  You're on the air.
[02:17:41.251 --> 02:17:42.772]  Go ahead.
[02:17:42.772 --> 02:17:43.613]  Hey, Alex.
[02:17:43.613 --> 02:17:46.854]  Yeah, I got some interesting news here from Michigan.
[02:17:49.013 --> 02:17:53.976]  Weeks ago, Tuesday before last, we had Kurt Haskell on the Nightly News.
[02:17:53.976 --> 02:17:58.679]  And, strange and rare thing happened just before he came on.
[02:17:58.679 --> 02:18:02.701]  In Monroe, Michigan, there was a car bomb that went off.
[02:18:02.701 --> 02:18:13.488]  Now, what's really strange is, Monroe, Michigan is a stone's throw away from Taylor, Michigan, which Mr. Haskell has offices there.
[02:18:13.488 --> 02:18:16.430]  And then, the car bomb went off in a lawyer's car!
[02:18:17.726 --> 02:18:20.269]  Uh, Mr. Eric Chappell.
[02:18:36.169 --> 02:18:41.834]  I googled both your names together and they come up on a court docket which is you know like a schedule so obviously they frequent the same places
[02:19:04.079 --> 02:19:06.022]  They're real close in proximity.
[02:19:06.022 --> 02:19:09.927]  Listen, I believe in coincidences, but I don't believe in three coincidences.
[02:19:09.927 --> 02:19:12.190]  Okay, it's very rare, first of all, in the U.S.
[02:19:12.190 --> 02:19:13.452]  to have a car bomb.
[02:19:13.452 --> 02:19:20.702]  And then it's a lawyer's car, then it's 20 miles away from a guy that's saying, you know, he's got evidence that it's
[02:19:21.297 --> 02:19:22.037]  The U.S.
[02:19:22.037 --> 02:19:27.080]  may be complicit in the... You know, I forget the details because it got almost no attention.
[02:19:27.080 --> 02:19:32.003]  And when it's an inside job, as I said the day it happened, you don't see a lot of coverage.
[02:19:32.003 --> 02:19:37.086]  If this had been something that they were staging, like the Times Square thing, it'd be hyperventilating for six weeks.
[02:19:37.086 --> 02:19:38.587]  You know what?
[02:19:38.587 --> 02:19:41.749]  Write up your points and send it to showtipsinfowars.com.
[02:19:41.749 --> 02:19:43.090]  And I'll run it by Kurt Haskell.
[02:19:43.939 --> 02:19:44.660]  No, that's it.
[02:19:44.660 --> 02:19:45.661]  I mean, to this point, I think...
[02:20:02.577 --> 02:20:04.119]  Hey Bill, pick up line 3, it's Brian.
[02:20:04.119 --> 02:20:06.101]  Hey Brian, what's up?
[02:20:06.101 --> 02:20:06.842]  Thanks.
[02:20:06.842 --> 02:20:12.267]  Hey Bill, I just received my shipment of the Safety Net, our full-year emergency food system.
[02:20:12.267 --> 02:20:20.176]  I can't tell you how great it feels to personally not have to worry anymore, especially with the growing threats to our everyday food supply.
[02:20:20.356 --> 02:20:30.422]  Brian, not only are you getting 4,320 nutritionally dense, delicious food servings, but the individual serving price is just $1.43 per meal.

[02:20:33.303 --> 02:20:35.825]  The variety is also a huge bonus bill.
[02:20:35.825 --> 02:20:39.187]  It's like having access to a full menu of impressive food.
[02:20:39.187 --> 02:20:44.570]  Well, it really is a safety net for those worried about the coming food shortages and how their families can prepare.
[02:20:44.890 --> 02:20:49.274]  It's great knowing I'm covered for the future, but I gotta go, Bill, and get all this food unloaded.

[02:24:01.393 --> 02:24:04.294]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:24:04.294 --> 02:24:07.075]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:24:15.464 --> 02:24:28.553]  Okay, Richard Reeves is not in the office right now, but he will be popping in via Skype from one of our other hidden locations in the last five minutes of the show today.
[02:24:30.506 --> 02:24:31.767]  He's actually here in the office.
[02:24:31.767 --> 02:24:33.688]  I want to do a Skype test when we go on the road.
[02:24:33.688 --> 02:24:36.309]  I don't usually misspeak.
[02:24:36.309 --> 02:24:37.990]  I'm like, he's not in the office.
[02:24:37.990 --> 02:24:39.431]  He's not going to be in this office.
[02:24:39.431 --> 02:24:42.753]  He's going to be back there in the corner office doing a Skype test.
[02:24:42.753 --> 02:24:52.378]  So instead of being in studio, we'll just have him over Skype from the other side of the building, testing it out for when I'm on the road with our new little Skype box, a little laptop we got.
[02:24:52.378 --> 02:24:53.979]  So we'll see how that looks.
[02:24:53.979 --> 02:24:58.241]  Or are we going to plug in an outside better camera when I'm on the road?
[02:24:58.241 --> 02:24:59.142]  That's another issue.
[02:25:00.322 --> 02:25:04.144]  Because the camera we have in here looks a lot better than just using a laptop camera.
[02:25:04.144 --> 02:25:05.024]  Have we thought about that?
[02:25:05.024 --> 02:25:07.605]  Okay, side issue, doesn't matter.
[02:25:07.605 --> 02:25:18.689]  I want to get to Otter, and Gary, and Bill, and others that are holding, but CJ, finishing up your point?
[02:25:18.689 --> 02:25:22.211]  Yeah, I just wanted to give my two cents for a suggestion on the InfoWord.
[02:25:22.211 --> 02:25:27.313]  You know, so many things happen locally that doesn't hit the national radar.
[02:25:27.313 --> 02:25:27.633]  Is there
[02:25:28.191 --> 02:25:34.816]  You know, I could email you or call your office phone, but you probably get so many that it's hard to get something hot.
[02:25:34.816 --> 02:25:39.138]  No, it's just information overload, and I've got nothing but pure work.
[02:25:39.138 --> 02:25:41.680]  I mean, last night my wife calls up and says, can you come to dinner at 7?
[02:25:41.680 --> 02:25:43.421]  And I said, maybe.
[02:25:43.421 --> 02:25:45.122]  Then she called him at 7, she said, you're not here.
[02:25:45.122 --> 02:25:47.524]  And I said, no, I'm doing the show live.
[02:25:47.524 --> 02:25:49.786]  Sometimes I do it taped, sometimes I do it live.
[02:25:49.786 --> 02:25:51.567]  I said, I'm doing Nightly News live.
[02:25:51.567 --> 02:25:52.728]  I got behind, it's live.
[02:25:53.448 --> 02:25:58.331]  And I'm like, I gotta go on TV, and then it becomes a whole issue of just having no life.
[02:25:58.331 --> 02:26:00.572]  So no, just send us emails.
[02:26:00.572 --> 02:26:01.433]  We catch most of it.
[02:26:01.433 --> 02:26:03.194]  I appreciate your call.
[02:26:03.194 --> 02:26:04.975]  Dave in California, you're on the air.
[02:26:04.975 --> 02:26:06.956]  Go ahead.
[02:26:06.956 --> 02:26:10.178]  Alex, you are a maverick, and you do the state of Texas proud.
[02:26:10.178 --> 02:26:14.361]  Wanted to talk about two points, if you don't mind.
[02:26:14.361 --> 02:26:17.443]  First is Chemtrails.
[02:26:17.443 --> 02:26:19.404]  You are on that issue on your
[02:26:20.177 --> 02:26:24.678]  That documentation because they are blasting us every Yosemite right now.
[02:26:24.678 --> 02:26:26.458]  It's horrible.
[02:26:26.458 --> 02:26:27.838]  People can't breathe.
[02:26:27.838 --> 02:26:29.399]  People are getting sick.
[02:26:29.399 --> 02:26:30.979]  It's a real, real deal.
[02:26:30.979 --> 02:26:33.639]  No, they admit it's killing the plants, too.
[02:26:33.639 --> 02:26:38.000]  And they were back in the news today admitting that government is geoengineering.
[02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:43.361]  And I saw a natural news story yesterday where people are now in Hawaii filing suit over it.
[02:26:43.361 --> 02:26:46.421]  But there's no doubt the aluminum level's going up and they're killing us.
[02:26:46.421 --> 02:26:49.222]  Meanwhile, they've got all the environmentalists scared of carbon dioxide.
[02:26:51.400 --> 02:26:52.241]  Twisted.
[02:26:52.241 --> 02:26:56.185]  But you're doing everyone proud to, you know, keep sharing the truth.
[02:26:56.185 --> 02:27:01.270]  The other thing is, basically my plan to save our country is the Republic.
[02:27:01.270 --> 02:27:08.177]  And it's not my plan, it was JFK's plan, which was Executive Order 11110.
[02:27:08.177 --> 02:27:10.840]  And he wrote that, it backed U.S.
[02:27:10.840 --> 02:27:14.484]  Treasury, not Federal Reserve, with silver.
[02:27:15.425 --> 02:27:36.251]  Silver certificates and I believe that's why Kennedy was assassinated and all of the debt has been created since that day and it's as you know a way to control us, but it has never been repealed and This executive order 1 1 1 1 0 With silver under $30 right now.
[02:27:36.251 --> 02:27:37.812]  It's trading at $29.50 it's they're crashing us and
[02:27:42.384 --> 02:27:43.967]  This can save our country.
[02:27:43.967 --> 02:27:49.317]  So I hope Ron Paul gets this message, or Jesse Ventura, and they back our...
[02:27:49.927 --> 02:27:50.247]  U.S.
[02:27:50.247 --> 02:27:53.949]  Treasury, the taxpayers, our money, not their money.
[02:27:53.949 --> 02:28:07.455]  Well, Dave, Dave, Ron Paul has written about that executive order that issued, it was going to be $50 billion, but only $5 billion got out, of $5 bills that have the red stamp, their collector item, you can buy them for about $15.
[02:28:07.455 --> 02:28:10.937]  Well, since I've talked about them, they're more like $50 I've seen them selling for.
[02:28:10.937 --> 02:28:14.819]  But there's limited circulation, they're Lincoln Greenbacks that he reissued.
[02:28:16.055 --> 02:28:21.958]  He was going to start abolishing the Federal Reserve and taking the power of the purse back to the Congress.
[02:28:21.958 --> 02:28:22.758]  And they killed him.
[02:28:22.758 --> 02:28:23.839]  That was the main thing.
[02:28:23.839 --> 02:28:25.520]  That was the last straw.
[02:28:25.520 --> 02:28:28.341]  And Ron Paul does want to abolish the Fed.
[02:28:28.341 --> 02:28:29.702]  He said, let's audit it first.
[02:28:29.702 --> 02:28:31.863]  But he says, well, I want to get rid of it.
[02:28:31.863 --> 02:28:35.345]  And look, Herman Cain was not just on the board of directors of the Federal Reserve.
[02:28:36.605 --> 02:28:42.228]  I have Aaron coming up, and I know all this stuff, but I like to always double-check it before I say it to make sure I'm right.
[02:28:42.228 --> 02:28:51.852]  Because sometimes my memory, you know, like yesterday I was saying, the EPA says melamine isn't bad for kids, and the guys couldn't find it, and they said, no, no, no, Alex, it's FDA.
[02:28:51.852 --> 02:28:55.553]  And I'm like, oh, of course, yeah, Food and Drug Administration says it's good for you.
[02:28:55.553 --> 02:28:57.174]  My memory can twist things.
[02:28:57.174 --> 02:28:58.995]  Aaron went and pulled it.
[02:28:58.995 --> 02:29:01.556]  He was not only on the board of directors,
[02:29:02.506 --> 02:29:10.693]  He was THE, THE director of the second most powerful Federal Reserve Branch Bank.
[02:29:10.693 --> 02:29:11.954]  The New York Fed's the most powerful.
[02:29:11.954 --> 02:29:16.097]  The one he was part of is the second most powerful.
[02:29:16.097 --> 02:29:18.679]  I mean, Herman Cain is super insider.
[02:29:18.679 --> 02:29:21.561]  I mean, he is like Henry Kissinger, minion level.
[02:29:21.561 --> 02:29:24.063]  Head of all these big national associations.
[02:29:24.063 --> 02:29:28.807]  I mean, and he's slick, he's smart, and he's super bad news.
[02:29:28.807 --> 02:29:31.209]  And I heard, uh, what's his name?
[02:29:31.209 --> 02:29:31.990]  Neil Borch last week.
[02:29:33.561 --> 02:29:38.144]  They rear him at night, locally, defending Herman Cain with his programs.
[02:29:38.144 --> 02:29:42.087]  People are like, Neil, we thought you were going to get rid of the income tax and then give us the sales tax.
[02:29:42.087 --> 02:29:45.710]  And he's like, well, we've got to have them both together for a while.
[02:29:45.710 --> 02:29:46.691]  I mean, come on, folks.
[02:29:46.691 --> 02:29:50.494]  I've been telling you for 15 years, that's coming.
[02:29:50.494 --> 02:29:51.895]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.895 --> 02:29:54.417]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.417 --> 02:29:57.099]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.964 --> 02:30:06.925]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:30:06.925 --> 02:30:15.786]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:30:15.786 --> 02:30:20.407]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:30:20.407 --> 02:30:31.229]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.

[02:30:54.294 --> 02:30:57.055]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[02:31:00.936 --> 02:31:02.116]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:31:02.116 --> 02:31:09.059]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:31:09.059 --> 02:31:11.600]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:31:11.600 --> 02:31:16.982]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:31:16.982 --> 02:31:20.023]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:31:20.023 --> 02:31:22.084]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:31:22.344 --> 02:31:28.589]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:31:28.589 --> 02:31:31.971]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:31:31.971 --> 02:31:37.756]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:31:37.756 --> 02:31:39.397]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:31:39.397 --> 02:31:40.698]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:31:40.698 --> 02:31:43.360]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:31:43.360 --> 02:31:47.603]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:31:47.603 --> 02:31:49.625]  You can find the video at www.
[02:31:50.385 --> 02:31:52.205]  End of America 3.com.
[02:31:52.205 --> 02:31:53.346]  That's End of America.
[02:31:53.346 --> 02:31:54.786]  The number 3.com.
[02:31:54.786 --> 02:31:58.647]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:31:58.647 --> 02:32:00.588]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:32:00.588 --> 02:32:05.149]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:32:05.149 --> 02:32:06.049]  Number 1.
[02:32:06.049 --> 02:32:09.470]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:32:09.470 --> 02:32:09.750]  Number 2.
[02:32:10.330 --> 02:32:15.235]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:32:15.235 --> 02:32:15.975]  It's true.
[02:32:15.975 --> 02:32:21.681]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:32:21.681 --> 02:32:25.264]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:32:25.264 --> 02:32:29.968]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:32:29.968 --> 02:32:32.731]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:32:32.731 --> 02:32:36.074]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:32:36.394 --> 02:32:41.338]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:32:41.338 --> 02:32:46.381]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:32:46.381 --> 02:32:50.564]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:50.564 --> 02:32:52.365]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:52.365 --> 02:32:56.949]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:33:02.873 --> 02:33:06.456]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:33:06.456 --> 02:33:10.619]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:40.129 --> 02:33:45.710]  Okay, we've got a judge ruling and that's in my stack I haven't gotten to yet.
[02:33:45.710 --> 02:33:47.270]  I've got to cover this.
[02:33:47.270 --> 02:33:53.912]  That you do not have the right to grow your own food on a farm or a garden or have a cow or drink the milk from your cow.
[02:33:53.912 --> 02:33:55.752]  It actually has a copy of the ruling.
[02:33:55.752 --> 02:33:56.932]  I checked this last night.
[02:33:56.932 --> 02:33:58.112]  It's true.
[02:33:58.112 --> 02:34:00.893]  The judge is saying you have no right to grow your own food.
[02:34:00.893 --> 02:34:03.433]  That, quote, the police power is over that.
[02:34:03.433 --> 02:34:05.454]  I mean, this government is completely out of control.
[02:34:06.816 --> 02:34:11.959]  We've also got a Natural News article that just went up at Infowars.com.
[02:34:11.959 --> 02:34:13.700]  CDC now calling U.S.
[02:34:13.700 --> 02:34:19.503]  households and demanding child immunization records as part of vaccine surveillance and tracking program.
[02:34:19.503 --> 02:34:21.764]  That's why you're seeing out in California, knock, knock.
[02:34:21.764 --> 02:34:22.904]  Hi, I'm here from the school.
[02:34:22.904 --> 02:34:24.565]  I'm coming in to vaccinate.
[02:34:24.565 --> 02:34:27.347]  Most people just go, my God, they got cops with them?
[02:34:27.347 --> 02:34:28.287]  Come in and shoot them up.
[02:34:28.287 --> 02:34:30.288]  It's all just total fraud.
[02:34:30.288 --> 02:34:32.950]  Like if cops showed up and said, let me, give me your jewelry.
[02:34:32.950 --> 02:34:34.851]  I mean, it's just, it's just government.
[02:34:34.851 --> 02:34:35.331]  It's tyranny.
[02:34:36.271 --> 02:34:37.292]  People say, well, how can they do that?
[02:34:37.292 --> 02:34:38.712]  Because they're criminals.
[02:34:38.712 --> 02:34:41.374]  I mean, they've decided to do it.
[02:34:41.374 --> 02:34:47.958]  And how did they take the veterans' death benefits, their life insurance policies from World War II through current?
[02:34:47.958 --> 02:34:53.781]  The government gave a secret waiver to the Big Ten insurance companies 12 years ago, and they did it.
[02:34:53.781 --> 02:34:56.523]  And then it came out in blue merch and nobody's going to get in trouble.
[02:34:56.523 --> 02:35:01.146]  Just like the ATF now has confirmed shipping 2,000 guns directly to Sinaloa drug cartel
[02:35:02.011 --> 02:35:07.093]  To knock out their competition and gave Sinaloa authorization to ship in tens of tons.
[02:35:07.093 --> 02:35:08.433]  All confirmed.
[02:35:08.433 --> 02:35:13.154]  The feds admit it in court and just say, so what?
[02:35:13.154 --> 02:35:16.555]  The government are narcotics trafficking criminals at the top.
[02:35:16.555 --> 02:35:20.017]  They got a bunch of compartmentalized fools under them.
[02:35:20.017 --> 02:35:22.717]  So this is all making my head spin.
[02:35:22.717 --> 02:35:24.218]  We're going to go to Aaron here in just a minute.
[02:35:24.218 --> 02:35:24.438]  Guys.
[02:35:27.574 --> 02:35:30.096]  More and more of this is happening where I'm just overwhelmed.
[02:35:30.096 --> 02:35:34.399]  I mean, no, there's no, it's always worse than I can even tell you.
[02:35:34.399 --> 02:35:35.099]  That's what I mean.
[02:35:35.099 --> 02:35:42.704]  And because it is so complex, because there's so much of the corruption, I can see how average people just say, well, government says do it.
[02:35:42.704 --> 02:35:44.245]  It must be okay.
[02:35:44.245 --> 02:35:46.347]  And so they go out and do all this horrible stuff.
[02:35:48.575 --> 02:35:52.059]  We're going to look at Herman Cain in a minute, who's really going after Ron Paul right now.
[02:35:52.059 --> 02:35:53.801]  I'm going to break that down in a moment.
[02:35:53.801 --> 02:35:57.044]  First off, though, I want to tell you about eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:35:57.044 --> 02:36:05.013]  They are running here for just a few more weeks free shipping to anywhere in the United States on all of their products for a limited time.

[02:36:22.611 --> 02:36:23.972]  to get the free shipping.
[02:36:23.972 --> 02:36:28.694]  So, efooddirect.com forward slash Alex or 800-409-5633.

[02:36:34.237 --> 02:36:36.999]  800-876-0871 and tell them Alex sends you to take advantage of that.
[02:36:46.727 --> 02:36:49.809]  Lastly, Pure Water Freedom has a line of whole household filters.
[02:36:49.809 --> 02:36:53.030]  They remove fluoride and other toxins from every water source in your home.
[02:36:53.030 --> 02:36:57.192]  They've got tabletop, under the sink, whole house, handheld water filters.
[02:36:57.192 --> 02:36:58.172]  They got the whole nine.
[02:36:58.172 --> 02:36:58.953]  It's made in America.
[02:36:58.953 --> 02:37:00.173]  I know that's evil.
[02:37:00.173 --> 02:37:01.414]  Purewaterfreedom.com.
[02:37:01.414 --> 02:37:07.017]  Imagine being able to turn on your tap water and it turns into safe, clean drinking and bathing water.
[02:37:07.017 --> 02:37:10.158]  When was the last time you took fluoride free shower?
[02:37:10.158 --> 02:37:12.059]  Turn your tap water into the best water.
[02:37:12.059 --> 02:37:15.641]  Purewaterfreedom.com today, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:37:16.550 --> 02:37:23.592]  Now I'm going to go back to your calls after I talk to Aaron and get into some news, but I wanted to talk about Mr. Herman Cain.
[02:37:23.592 --> 02:37:26.893]  And we've got an article up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:37:26.893 --> 02:37:28.594]  It's important to get out to people.
[02:37:28.594 --> 02:37:32.775]  We've pretty much started the destruction of Rick Perry with his horrible record.
[02:37:33.826 --> 02:37:42.012]  I mean, it was too much for even neocon rhinos that he was Al Gore's former chief of staff in Texas, and then in 93-94 supported Hillarycare.
[02:37:42.012 --> 02:37:46.295]  It was too much for people that he supported gun control.
[02:37:46.295 --> 02:37:55.461]  It was too much for people that he supported forced inoculations and handing 8,000 miles of roads over to foreign companies to turn existing roads into toll roads.
[02:37:55.461 --> 02:37:56.182]  It goes on and on.
[02:37:57.600 --> 02:37:59.481]  The sanctuary cities were the end of it.
[02:37:59.481 --> 02:38:03.902]  And the free tuition, you know, the in-state tuition that other Americans don't get for illegals.
[02:38:03.902 --> 02:38:08.343]  And that the majority of the jobs, 81% were to immigrants, most of them illegals, 93%.
[02:38:08.343 --> 02:38:11.484]  That was too much.
[02:38:11.484 --> 02:38:14.205]  And, you know, the snake isn't dead politically yet.
[02:38:14.205 --> 02:38:17.366]  He's not completely dead, but he's damaged and floundering around.
[02:38:17.366 --> 02:38:21.527]  We know we've got him and he looks totally freaked out and like the air was sucked out of him.
[02:38:21.527 --> 02:38:24.608]  Narcissists like that don't do well when they're attacked.
[02:38:24.608 --> 02:38:25.548]  See, I love being attacked.
[02:38:25.548 --> 02:38:26.809]  It helps me because I know I'm in the right.
[02:38:27.682 --> 02:38:30.464]  Okay, people take my aggression and everything for narcissism.
[02:38:30.464 --> 02:38:31.605]  It's the opposite.
[02:38:31.605 --> 02:38:35.589]  This is savage hatred of tyranny and a lust for life and justice.
[02:38:35.589 --> 02:38:36.610]  That's what you see here.
[02:38:36.610 --> 02:38:39.272]  Somebody like Perry, I saw him on the news last night and again this morning.
[02:38:39.272 --> 02:38:41.794]  Boy, he looks like a zombie.
[02:38:41.794 --> 02:38:43.336]  He suddenly looks 20 years older.
[02:38:43.336 --> 02:38:49.961]  It looks like everything's been sucked out of him because he knows, he knows, he knows he's coming to the end of his road.
[02:38:52.233 --> 02:38:55.897]  Somebody else playing the sympathy card and all this garbage is Herman Cain.
[02:38:55.897 --> 02:38:57.799]  And we're gonna get him too.
[02:38:57.799 --> 02:39:00.141]  And we're gonna get Mitt Romney.
[02:39:00.141 --> 02:39:02.464]  Because even if they cheat and don't let Ron Paul get in...
[02:39:04.206 --> 02:39:07.587]  We're still going to destroy their puppets, just like we've destroyed Obama.
[02:39:07.587 --> 02:39:10.928]  He is a dead political duck up there rotting in front of everyone.
[02:39:10.928 --> 02:39:16.510]  Now, Herman Cain describes Ron Paul supporters' concerns as stupid.
[02:39:16.510 --> 02:39:19.591]  We actually have a video clip that Aaron has gotten together.
[02:39:19.591 --> 02:39:20.812]  We ought to add that up on the site.
[02:39:20.812 --> 02:39:25.493]  I remember seeing this a while back, where he says it's stupid to want to audit the private fellow reserve.
[02:39:25.493 --> 02:39:27.654]  You know, Congress keeps asking, where'd the trillions go?
[02:39:27.654 --> 02:39:30.055]  And you've seen Bernanke say, I'm not going to tell you.
[02:39:30.555 --> 02:39:31.757]  I'm not going to tell you.
[02:39:31.757 --> 02:39:33.120]  Well, where did the trillions go?
[02:39:33.120 --> 02:39:34.242]  I'm not going to tell you.
[02:39:34.242 --> 02:39:40.373]  Now we know to foreign banks, to foreign individuals, to globalists, to Warren Buffett, to people like that.
[02:39:41.946 --> 02:39:52.153]  Now Herman Cain, who's been pushing for 15 years, which I learned 15 years ago, the Republican Party and the Federal Reserve and the Democratic Party were all involved in the fair tax movement.
[02:39:52.153 --> 02:39:53.614]  You want to get mad at me for being right?
[02:39:53.614 --> 02:39:54.255]  Sorry.
[02:39:54.255 --> 02:40:03.361]  And I've told you for 15 years, I learned about this a year into being on air, and was promoting it, and a guy brought me documents and met me outside and said, Alex, this is a setup.
[02:40:03.361 --> 02:40:04.742]  They're going to keep the income tax.
[02:40:04.742 --> 02:40:06.203]  Here's the foundations promoting it.
[02:40:06.203 --> 02:40:10.567]  They're just going to change the name of the income tax to saying it's for Social Security only.
[02:40:11.147 --> 02:40:12.447]  Like 10% or so.
[02:40:12.447 --> 02:40:16.828]  And then they'll give you a VAT and a sales tax on top of it and not get rid of it.
[02:40:16.828 --> 02:40:19.769]  And I went with that and was criticized for 15 years.
[02:40:19.769 --> 02:40:26.870]  Herman Cain has now come out and said, the plan is that we're going to have a 9% tax over here, a 9% over here, and a 9% over here.
[02:40:26.870 --> 02:40:29.811]  And we're going to keep the income tax.
[02:40:29.811 --> 02:40:32.612]  And I've heard meal boards defending this.
[02:40:32.612 --> 02:40:33.552]  Mr. Fair Tax.
[02:40:33.552 --> 02:40:38.593]  I mean, I told you I'm right again, not because I'm smart, but because I research.
[02:40:39.491 --> 02:40:40.472]  Okay?
[02:40:40.472 --> 02:40:41.212]  I told you!
[02:40:41.212 --> 02:40:44.734]  And we're going to go into Herman Cain's real background here in a moment.
[02:40:44.734 --> 02:40:50.817]  I want you to get this audio, get this video you're watching and listening to, get this PrisonPlanet.tv archive, and get out to everybody.
[02:40:50.817 --> 02:40:54.679]  Because we've got to now move into destroying Herman Cain and Mitt Romney.
[02:40:54.679 --> 02:40:59.022]  Like I told you, I don't spend much time on Obama, as bad as he is.
[02:40:59.022 --> 02:41:05.125]  He's been given dictatorial power, but he is politically destroyed now, so he flounders around.
[02:41:05.125 --> 02:41:07.086]  It's these new cats we've got to worry about.
[02:41:07.978 --> 02:41:09.940]  Because people haven't figured them out yet.
[02:41:09.940 --> 02:41:12.002]  People can have this little hope they're going to save them.
[02:41:12.002 --> 02:41:14.264]  They haven't done the research on them.
[02:41:14.264 --> 02:41:17.428]  We've got cyanide tablets politically for them.
[02:41:17.428 --> 02:41:19.910]  We need to make sure they take their medicine.
[02:41:19.910 --> 02:41:20.231]  Okay?
[02:41:20.231 --> 02:41:22.373]  We've given Perry his medicine.
[02:41:22.373 --> 02:41:24.395]  He ain't looking too good, is he?
[02:41:24.395 --> 02:41:28.239]  These egomaniacs don't look too good when they're burning up.
[02:41:28.239 --> 02:41:29.060]  Burning down.
[02:41:30.811 --> 02:41:32.292]  So we're going to give Herman Cain his medicine.
[02:41:32.292 --> 02:41:34.873]  We're going to give Mitt Romney his medicine.
[02:41:34.873 --> 02:41:37.115]  We've already given Obama and Rick Perry their medicine.
[02:41:37.115 --> 02:41:41.677]  And if that doesn't fully bring them down, we're going to give them more medicine.
[02:41:41.677 --> 02:41:49.362]  But right now, we've got to move on to those that haven't been given the first round of Patriot Truth, their real record medicine.
[02:41:49.362 --> 02:41:52.043]  Are you going to help me give them their medicine?
[02:41:52.043 --> 02:41:55.325]  Let's give it to them!
[02:41:55.325 --> 02:41:57.026]  Fire at will!
[02:41:57.026 --> 02:41:58.547]  Let's go ahead and go to this clip.
[02:41:58.547 --> 02:42:00.408]  Here's some medicine for Herman Cain.
[02:42:01.482 --> 02:42:04.884]  Some people say that we ought to audit the Federal Reserve.
[02:42:04.884 --> 02:42:06.405]  Here's what I do know.
[02:42:06.405 --> 02:42:12.068]  The Federal Reserve already has so many internal audits, it's ridiculous.
[02:42:12.068 --> 02:42:19.512]  I don't know why people think we're going to learn this great amount of information by auditing the Federal Reserve.
[02:42:19.512 --> 02:42:22.294]  Now, I no longer serve on the board of the Federal Reserve.
[02:42:22.294 --> 02:42:24.515]  I'm not being defensive of the Federal Reserve.
[02:42:24.515 --> 02:42:29.778]  In fact, some of the policies and some of the actions of the Federal Reserve today, I don't agree with.
[02:42:30.538 --> 02:42:40.202]  Because the attitude and the non-politicization of the Federal Reserve in the 90s when I served on it is totally different than what's going on today.
[02:42:40.202 --> 02:42:41.483]  But that's another matter.
[02:42:41.483 --> 02:42:45.545]  But people who say, well, we ought to audit the Federal Reserve because we don't know enough about it.
[02:42:45.545 --> 02:42:49.907]  Well, here's the advice I've given to people who are worried about an audit of the Federal Reserve.
[02:42:51.237 --> 02:43:01.848]  Call them up and ask them if you can stop by and have one of their PR people or one of their public relations people explain to you how the Federal Reserve operates.
[02:43:01.848 --> 02:43:07.914]  I think a lot of people are calling for this audit of the Federal Reserve because they don't know enough about it.
[02:43:09.076 --> 02:43:13.920]  There's no hidden secrets going on in the Federal Reserve to my knowledge.
[02:43:13.920 --> 02:43:17.903]  And I tell people, you know, we've got 12 Federal Reserve Banks.
[02:43:17.903 --> 02:43:20.124]  Find out which district you're in.
[02:43:20.124 --> 02:43:22.726]  Call them up and go from there.
[02:43:22.726 --> 02:43:29.452]  We don't need to waste money with another commission or an audit that's not necessary.
[02:43:29.452 --> 02:43:33.034]  Okay, and you can tell that was on the Neil Bortz program when he was filling in.
[02:43:33.034 --> 02:43:34.976]  Now, let's stop right there.
[02:43:36.127 --> 02:43:41.151]  I gotta do a news piece on this in the next few days, showing where Congress can't find out where the money went.
[02:43:41.151 --> 02:43:51.158]  And when they did, they learned hundreds of millions went to MSNBC to have Rachel Maddow sit up there and demonize the Founding Fathers and Ron Paul.
[02:43:51.158 --> 02:43:52.239]  Now here's the deal.
[02:43:52.239 --> 02:43:53.620]  When he was on there in the 1990s,
[02:43:56.169 --> 02:43:59.871]  That's 1,500 trillion that they claim we owe even though we never got any of that money.
[02:43:59.871 --> 02:43:59.951]  Okay?
[02:44:18.553 --> 02:44:28.358]  So, I mean, I have never heard such absolute bull glad-handing garbage in my life.
[02:44:28.358 --> 02:44:32.560]  The only good thing about Herman Cain is no matter what audience he's in front of, he talks the same.
[02:44:32.560 --> 02:44:36.902]  With Obama, he's in front of a bunch of white people who get up there and go, Hi guys, good to see you here.
[02:44:36.902 --> 02:44:40.463]  It's like watching a black comedian do an imitation of a white person.
[02:44:40.463 --> 02:44:42.464]  Well, how you doing there?
[02:44:42.464 --> 02:44:43.285]  My name's Urkel.
[02:44:44.127 --> 02:44:48.228]  And then when he gets up in front of black folks, he's like, I'm Barack Obama, I like basketball.
[02:44:48.228 --> 02:44:50.048]  And we're going to do a special on that tonight.
[02:44:50.048 --> 02:44:55.529]  It's like Hillary Clinton in Kentucky goes from her Yankee accent to like, good to be here with you today.
[02:44:55.529 --> 02:44:58.570]  I mean, look, I don't just get off on hating on people.
[02:44:58.570 --> 02:45:02.031]  Herman Cain is a slick corporate salesman.
[02:45:02.031 --> 02:45:04.031]  And everybody's like, wow, he knows how to run private business.
[02:45:04.031 --> 02:45:04.932]  Let's get him in there.
[02:45:04.932 --> 02:45:06.912]  Well, he knows how to run the Federal Reserve.
[02:45:06.912 --> 02:45:09.613]  We need to get rid of the Federal Reserve that we didn't have until 1913, 97 years ago.
[02:45:12.179 --> 02:45:14.360]  We need to get rid of it.
[02:45:14.360 --> 02:45:20.722]  We don't need a former Federal Reserve head of their second most powerful branch in control.
[02:45:20.722 --> 02:45:26.844]  Aaron Dykes, give us a report on this and we'll document Cam over there where you're at as well so people can see the articles you've got.
[02:45:26.844 --> 02:45:29.145]  Break down Lord Cain for us.
[02:45:29.525 --> 02:45:34.089]  Look, as a politician, he's being sold as another phony outsider independent.
[02:45:34.089 --> 02:45:34.630]  Not true.
[02:45:34.630 --> 02:45:39.814]  He owes his whole career to the Skull and Bones Pillsbury cartel family.
[02:45:39.814 --> 02:45:41.135]  And that's not an independent business.
[02:45:41.135 --> 02:45:42.857]  That destroys independent business.
[02:45:42.857 --> 02:45:44.719]  Contributes to bad health and all the rest of it.
[02:45:44.719 --> 02:45:46.420]  And Pillsbury is total pimp level.
[02:45:46.420 --> 02:45:47.041]  They're right at the top.
[02:45:47.501 --> 02:45:52.043]  Remember in 2008 presidential race John McCain didn't have a pulse.
[02:45:52.043 --> 02:45:55.845]  He didn't even show up in the polls until Giuliani dropped out.
[02:45:55.845 --> 02:45:57.766]  Then suddenly he rose to prominence.
[02:45:57.766 --> 02:45:59.607]  They have these people waiting in the wings.
[02:45:59.607 --> 02:46:01.228]  Palin's waiting in the wings.
[02:46:01.228 --> 02:46:05.831]  People like Herman Cain are waiting in the wings if they can't sell Perry and the rest of them.
[02:46:05.831 --> 02:46:09.613]  Now Herman Cain himself started at the Department of the Navy
[02:46:10.453 --> 02:46:18.279]  By the way, that's where they get their top minions is out of the Navy, and they sheep dip them into intelligence from that.
[02:46:18.279 --> 02:46:20.581]  That's a big point right there.
[02:46:20.581 --> 02:46:21.041]  That's right.
[02:46:21.041 --> 02:46:23.483]  Then he worked for the Coca-Cola Company as a business analyst.
[02:46:23.483 --> 02:46:24.844]  Totally selected.
[02:46:24.844 --> 02:46:32.310]  Then, starting in 1977, he joined Pillsbury, rising to Vice President in the early 80s.
[02:46:32.310 --> 02:46:35.793]  Then they moved him to Burger King, a Pillsbury subsidiary.
[02:46:35.793 --> 02:46:36.954]  That's healthy for black people.
[02:46:37.694 --> 02:46:41.016]  Then, well everyone of course, but I mean, you know, the perception.
[02:46:41.016 --> 02:46:46.139]  Then he became CEO of Godfather's Pizza, also a Pillsbury company.
[02:46:46.139 --> 02:46:50.102]  Then Pillsbury sold off their interest, there was mergers, there's inside baseball and that.
[02:46:50.102 --> 02:46:58.046]  The point is, he rose to business prominence through the Pillsbury cartel, who are established founding members of the Skull and Bones.
[02:46:58.046 --> 02:47:01.228]  So in our research, they're right up there at the top.
[02:47:01.228 --> 02:47:06.832]  Now getting to the big point though, he wasn't just on the board of a regional fed, he was the director.
[02:47:06.832 --> 02:47:07.212]  Tell him that.
[02:47:07.352 --> 02:47:15.498]  Yeah, first he was deputy director, then he was actual director for a total of five years while he was simultaneously still Godfather Pizza CEO.
[02:47:15.498 --> 02:47:17.839]  So that's independent business for you, working for the Federal Reserve.
[02:47:17.839 --> 02:47:19.721]  And again, tell them what branch he was the head of.
[02:47:19.721 --> 02:47:21.122]  Yeah, at Kansas City.
[02:47:21.122 --> 02:47:25.224]  And you heard in the clip where he says, just call them up, go down there, ask them what they're doing.
[02:47:25.224 --> 02:47:31.409]  They almost had me arrested for filming, not even on their property from, you know, like you say, a hundred yards away at that park.
[02:47:32.029 --> 02:47:33.271]  You're more than 100 yards.
[02:47:33.271 --> 02:47:33.892]  Yeah.
[02:47:33.892 --> 02:47:36.715]  They come out with hands on their guns, and you said, we're not doing anything.
[02:47:36.715 --> 02:47:38.798]  I said, go, or we're gonna, you know.
[02:47:38.798 --> 02:47:39.659]  Yeah, so call them up.
[02:47:39.659 --> 02:47:44.786]  And then, even though it was on the news, the newspaper quoted the Federal Reserve as saying they didn't do that.
[02:47:46.237 --> 02:47:46.657]  Remember that?
[02:47:46.657 --> 02:47:48.099]  They just implied, we don't do that.
[02:47:48.099 --> 02:47:48.639]  We didn't do that.
[02:47:48.639 --> 02:47:51.842]  Yeah, but those security officers who almost posed as police.
[02:47:51.842 --> 02:47:56.867]  You should have, you know, I told you guys not to get arrested, but you should have just gotten arrested and sued them like they're doing now.
[02:47:56.867 --> 02:47:57.948]  Yeah, it makes sense.
[02:47:57.948 --> 02:47:59.109]  But they admitted they got the phone call.
[02:47:59.109 --> 02:48:00.471]  The problem is they had their hands on their guns.
[02:48:00.471 --> 02:48:01.171]  They probably would have.
[02:48:01.171 --> 02:48:02.333]  I mean, God knows these people.
[02:48:02.813 --> 02:48:05.635]  I mean, they're just like, you're a half mile away.
[02:48:05.635 --> 02:48:06.376]  Get out of here!
[02:48:06.376 --> 02:48:07.176]  First show me your ID.
[02:48:07.176 --> 02:48:08.737]  Well, okay, I don't have to, but here it is.
[02:48:08.737 --> 02:48:09.958]  All right, get out of the area.
[02:48:09.958 --> 02:48:13.340]  We're in a city park, and there's like, guns?
[02:48:13.340 --> 02:48:13.941]  We have guns.
[02:48:13.941 --> 02:48:15.062]  It's like a World War I memorial.
[02:48:15.062 --> 02:48:17.884]  But Herman Cain's like, just call them up.
[02:48:17.884 --> 02:48:19.044]  They're your friend.
[02:48:19.044 --> 02:48:22.087]  They admitted they got a call from the Federal Reserve there.
[02:48:22.087 --> 02:48:25.069]  The security for the World War I memorial, public park.
[02:48:25.919 --> 02:48:27.339]  That's why they came over.
[02:48:27.339 --> 02:48:29.920]  But, yeah, a little more on Pillsbury.
[02:48:29.920 --> 02:48:38.543]  Their most important director who managed their business, Frederick T. Gates, he went on from Pillsbury to lead the Rockefeller Foundation and make them the monster they were.
[02:48:38.543 --> 02:48:40.243]  With all the education and the rest of it.
[02:48:40.243 --> 02:48:41.924]  Pillsbury's right at the top.
[02:48:41.924 --> 02:48:45.445]  Yeah, and they're totally 100% in bed with the skull and bones.
[02:48:45.445 --> 02:48:49.967]  There's all kinds of important politicians who branch out from their family line.
[02:48:49.967 --> 02:48:51.147]  It's a total cartel, Alex.
[02:48:52.282 --> 02:48:53.945]  And Herman Cain represents them.
[02:48:53.945 --> 02:48:56.190]  That's how he rose to prominence.
[02:48:56.190 --> 02:48:59.937]  Well, what about the fact that he wants us to have a sales tax?
[02:48:59.937 --> 02:49:01.820]  And he's like, we've got to pay our debts!
[02:49:02.745 --> 02:49:04.426]  We've got to pull up those clips.
[02:49:04.426 --> 02:49:06.328]  We don't owe this stuff, Herman Cain.
[02:49:06.328 --> 02:49:13.214]  He's a Federal Reserve pimp in there, just like all of these mainline Republicans.
[02:49:13.214 --> 02:49:19.439]  He is in there wanting us to go, OK, more taxes so they can give it to themselves and banker bailouts.
[02:49:19.439 --> 02:49:21.081]  And he's like, just call them up.
[02:49:21.081 --> 02:49:22.402]  They'll tell you everything.
[02:49:22.662 --> 02:49:24.724]  And you've heard him in the debates and in other statements.
[02:49:24.724 --> 02:49:26.045]  He's pro-torture.
[02:49:26.045 --> 02:49:27.546]  They asked him, would he end the wars?
[02:49:27.546 --> 02:49:29.087]  Would he bring the troops home?
[02:49:29.087 --> 02:49:32.270]  Well, I can't answer that, but I would listen to the advisors.
[02:49:32.270 --> 02:49:36.374]  In other words, the same Council on Foreign Relations advisors that he already serves.
[02:49:37.159 --> 02:49:37.779]  Same circle.
[02:49:37.779 --> 02:49:39.900]  I mean, he's horrible.
[02:49:39.900 --> 02:49:41.220]  He's absolutely horrible.
[02:49:41.220 --> 02:49:42.701]  Another puppet waiting in the wings.
[02:49:42.701 --> 02:49:43.841]  You know, I take it back.
[02:49:43.841 --> 02:49:50.483]  I say he's not as bad as a Mitt Romney who supports carbon taxes and gun grabs and wrote the Obama thing.
[02:49:50.483 --> 02:49:51.643]  They're all the same.
[02:49:51.643 --> 02:49:52.523]  It's an empty suit.
[02:49:52.523 --> 02:49:54.384]  They'll rotate in whoever they could sell.
[02:49:54.384 --> 02:50:00.166]  If they can't sell Perry, which they've already failed on, they can't sell Romney, they have Cain, Palin, others as well.
[02:50:01.960 --> 02:50:04.262]  But there's one guy, though, they say we can't have.
[02:50:04.262 --> 02:50:05.202]  He can't win.
[02:50:05.202 --> 02:50:05.923]  No, he can't win.
[02:50:05.923 --> 02:50:09.965]  He's the guy that wants to get rid of the place Herman came as the boss said.
[02:50:09.965 --> 02:50:13.228]  He can't win because the Federal Reserve parasite's sucking everything out.
[02:50:13.228 --> 02:50:15.709]  That's obviously probably the number one issue.
[02:50:15.709 --> 02:50:20.552]  Ron Paul's the only one that will actually point at the giant goblin in the room.
[02:50:20.552 --> 02:50:24.335]  Yeah, and I believe two debates back, they asked the question about the Federal Reserve.
[02:50:24.335 --> 02:50:27.517]  They asked everyone except Ron Paul what they would do to abolish the Fed.
[02:50:27.577 --> 02:50:30.280]  Well, look, we gotta get busy exposing Herman Cain.
[02:50:30.280 --> 02:50:33.923]  We gotta get busy exposing his stupid fair tax garbage.
[02:50:33.923 --> 02:50:35.685]  And people are like, what, you like the income tax?
[02:50:35.685 --> 02:50:36.906]  No!
[02:50:36.906 --> 02:50:37.426]  No!
[02:50:37.426 --> 02:50:39.548]  No, get rid of it and nothing new.
[02:50:39.548 --> 02:50:42.231]  We've got all these other taxes on top of it.
[02:50:42.231 --> 02:50:42.951]  Heard of tariffs?
[02:50:43.712 --> 02:50:45.694]  China's got them doing pretty good, aren't they?
[02:50:45.694 --> 02:50:51.480]  But the worst thing is they're selling him as an independent alternative just because he hasn't been in political puppet office yet.
[02:50:51.480 --> 02:50:55.404]  They're a bunch of... He's been in the real office of the real government.
[02:50:55.404 --> 02:50:57.466]  The ones that hijacked us, the private federal reserve.
[02:50:57.466 --> 02:50:58.107]  Good job, Aaron.
[02:50:58.107 --> 02:50:58.588]  We'll be back.
[02:50:58.588 --> 02:50:59.048]  Stay with us.
[02:50:59.048 --> 02:50:59.529]  Richard Raves.
[02:51:01.380 --> 02:51:05.225]  Are you tired of spending money for metal canning lids year after year?
[02:51:05.225 --> 02:51:06.406]  Then stop!
[02:51:06.406 --> 02:51:09.850]  Stop buying metal lids and get Tattler Reusable Canning Lids.

[02:51:17.339 --> 02:51:21.322]  Traditional metal lids are single-use throwaways that contain BPA.

[02:51:45.559 --> 02:51:46.899]  Tattler Reusable Canning Lids.
[02:51:46.899 --> 02:51:47.499]  The original since 1976.
[02:52:00.885 --> 02:52:02.928]  They're poisoning the water with fluoride.
[02:52:02.928 --> 02:52:05.071]  They're spraying the air with heavy metals.
[02:52:05.071 --> 02:52:07.755]  Why and what can you do to defend your family?
[02:52:07.755 --> 02:52:15.005]  This week at WaterWebinar.com, in an all-new free live online webinar, Earth's most powerful cleansing secret is being revealed.
[02:52:15.005 --> 02:52:17.268]  A secret they don't want you to know about.
[02:52:17.268 --> 02:52:18.029]  Find out how to take
[02:52:18.029 --> 02:52:21.170]  Get fluoride and heavy metals out of your water and your body.
[02:52:21.170 --> 02:52:28.332]  Use it to neutralize deadly inorganic particles like lead, aluminum, even mercury, and remove these accumulated poisons from your body.
[02:52:28.332 --> 02:52:35.615]  Go to WaterWebinar.com, a water secret so powerful some have called it the number one threat to the entire New World Order health agenda.
[02:52:35.615 --> 02:52:38.996]  It was even used during Chernobyl to clean up nuclear contamination.

[02:52:46.738 --> 02:52:47.118]  We're good.
[02:53:01.889 --> 02:53:07.615]  Our rights as individuals to freely purchase dietary supplements over the counter are under constant attack.
[02:53:07.615 --> 02:53:11.779]  The globalists want to ban all supplements formulated after 1994.
[02:53:11.779 --> 02:53:17.524]  Governments are hoarding raw materials, affecting our ability to purchase these products at a reasonable price.
[02:53:17.524 --> 02:53:23.150]  Even organic foods are stripped of nutrients due to overuse of soil and compromised growing conditions.
[02:53:23.470 --> 02:53:30.055]  Storable foods are essential, but you also need to make sure you have the nutrients you need to stay healthy during emergencies.
[02:53:30.055 --> 02:53:37.762]  Go to SurvivalRx.com today and see the amazing line of storable supplements they have to protect the ones you love.
[02:53:37.762 --> 02:53:43.046]  The owners of SurvivalRx.com have been in sports nutrition for over a decade.
[02:53:43.046 --> 02:53:46.567]  While the unions are big businessmen, and they're going out in black dinosaurs,
[02:54:28.287 --> 02:54:38.915]  By the way, this story is out of no national animal identification system dot org and I went and checked it.
[02:54:38.915 --> 02:54:40.476]  The original document can be seen.
[02:54:40.476 --> 02:54:41.377]  I went and read it.
[02:54:42.470 --> 02:55:02.864]  On the court document, a Wisconsin judge, a state judge, has said that you're not allowed to have your own garden, you're not allowed to have your own cow, your own milk, you're not allowed to pay somebody to keep a cow for milk, and that you do not have a fundamental right, and that the state's scope of police power is above you.
[02:55:02.864 --> 02:55:04.245]  I'm going to be covering that tonight.
[02:55:04.245 --> 02:55:08.187]  We've got something really special for you on InfoWars Nightly News tonight, 7 o'clock.
[02:55:08.187 --> 02:55:10.149]  There's also the InfoWars Insider.
[02:55:11.854 --> 02:55:19.343]  That is a free email that we send out videos, articles, multiple times weekly, but always officially Wednesday afternoon.
[02:55:19.343 --> 02:55:24.189]  If you want to sign up, it's at the top of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:55:24.189 --> 02:55:26.312]  Just put your email in there.
[02:55:26.312 --> 02:55:30.497]  I will tell you though, it causes us real havoc when people are lazy when they want to delete the email.
[02:55:31.238 --> 02:55:33.839]  They just hit the spam button instead of delete.
[02:55:33.839 --> 02:55:35.820]  That causes some problems.
[02:55:35.820 --> 02:55:38.161]  But hey, whatever, c'est la vie.
[02:55:38.161 --> 02:55:51.647]  Point is, is that we need to have direct contact with people and if you want that with us, no matter what happens or what comes up in the future, sign up at PrisonPlanet.tv to watch the show, but more importantly, sign up there at that email at InfoWarsInsider.
[02:55:51.647 --> 02:55:57.150]  I'll do five minutes of overdrive here as I tend to always do now to finish up with calls, because I at least want to get to
[02:55:59.949 --> 02:56:04.772]  He's been holding the longest, Bill, and Gary, and Otter, maybe Joel, we'll see.
[02:56:04.772 --> 02:56:13.418]  But briefly, joining us via Skype from about 50 yards away, we're testing Skype out for when I go on the road, is Richard Reeves.
[02:56:13.418 --> 02:56:19.442]  And Richard's a real Ron Paul expert, been a Ron Paul delegate, knocked on thousands of doors, eats, sleeps, and drinks it.
[02:56:19.442 --> 02:56:20.983]  And he kind of disagrees.
[02:56:20.983 --> 02:56:25.446]  He's saying Ron Paul will probably not run as a Libertarian if he loses the primary.
[02:56:25.446 --> 02:56:27.308]  And tell us why Richard Reeves.
[02:56:28.237 --> 02:56:29.018]  Well, thanks, Alex.
[02:56:29.018 --> 02:56:33.620]  I'm here broadcasting from the decentralized mobile command center.
[02:56:33.620 --> 02:56:45.428]  And no, I don't think Ron Paul will bail out because there's a very important battle going on with the delegate battle that's going to be underlying and underneath the actual primary elections.
[02:56:45.428 --> 02:56:49.550]  We're going to have to monitor and watch for the news stories that go unreported.
[02:56:49.550 --> 02:56:54.193]  We're going to have to be digging to find out, for example, when we have the New Hampshire primary.
[02:56:54.193 --> 02:56:55.074]  OK, yeah, fine.
[02:56:55.074 --> 02:56:55.914]  We're going to look at the
[02:56:56.895 --> 02:56:59.398]  Okay, but look, I don't want to put the cart before the horse.
[02:56:59.398 --> 02:57:01.319]  He can probably win, especially if we believe in him.
[02:57:01.319 --> 02:57:02.160]  He's in third place.
[02:57:02.160 --> 02:57:05.483]  We're destroying the other candidates right now for the record.
[02:57:19.375 --> 02:57:27.623]  I'm just saying, if he loses in the primary, I understand trying to build the party, have Libertarians and Patriots take over the Republican Party.
[02:57:27.623 --> 02:57:28.163]  I get that.
[02:57:28.163 --> 02:57:29.905]  That's what Campaign for Liberty is doing.
[02:57:29.905 --> 02:57:34.750]  I understand Ron Paul sees himself as part of a larger battle, not the whole war himself.
[02:57:36.698 --> 02:57:38.680]  It's all coming down right now.
[02:57:38.680 --> 02:57:52.234]  And I think he could run as a libertarian and state all this openly and tell people to go into the Republican Party or Democratic Party and stay in this key election and in those debates while everything's melting down.
[02:57:52.234 --> 02:57:55.617]  I think it can be a bifurcated pincer attack here, Richard.
[02:57:56.238 --> 02:58:03.124]  Well, I think that option in 2014, 2016 is probably a more viable option, potentially upcoming elections.
[02:58:03.124 --> 02:58:14.733]  But in this election, it's just too important because if we go third party early, then that means that patriots aren't voting in primaries for their county commissioners, for their U.S.
[02:58:14.733 --> 02:58:18.736]  House members, for their state legislative members.
[02:58:18.736 --> 02:58:21.919]  These races in these primaries are so important
[02:58:22.359 --> 02:58:33.744]  In firing these long-term incumbents, both on the Republican side, mainly on the Republican side, and also on the Democrat side, Ron Paul knows that this whole race is way bigger than just... Alright, alright, alright.
[02:58:33.744 --> 02:58:34.084]  Stay there.
[02:58:34.084 --> 02:58:35.865]  We're doing five more minutes at least.
[02:58:35.865 --> 02:58:38.166]  We'll finish up on that and then a few calls on the other side.
[02:58:38.166 --> 02:58:39.067]  Overdrive coming up.
[02:58:39.067 --> 02:58:42.828]  See you back tomorrow live at 11 a.m.
[02:58:42.828 --> 02:58:44.029]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:44.029 --> 02:58:46.850]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.257 --> 02:58:54.599]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck with an urgent update from eFoods Direct.
[02:58:58.814 --> 02:59:07.397]  The Food Direct has been doing all we can this year to help you get food before the perfect storm of exploding food prices from the 2011 harvest.
[02:59:07.397 --> 02:59:12.199]  During September, eFoods is giving you free shipping on your food supply orders.
[02:59:12.199 --> 02:59:16.341]  But you have to understand we're entering the eye of the food cost storm.
[02:59:16.341 --> 02:59:23.224]  Ethanol is boosting gas prices and driving corn costs so high our wheat for bread is going into animal feed.
[02:59:23.624 --> 02:59:26.705]  And pasta wheat cost has doubled since last year.
[02:59:26.705 --> 02:59:31.846]  I strongly advise you to get your order in before the free shipping deadline September 30th.
[02:59:31.846 --> 02:59:35.887]  Free shipping including Alaska and Hawaii ends September 30th.
[02:59:35.887 --> 02:59:38.348]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex.
[02:59:38.348 --> 02:59:42.169]  That's 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex.
[02:59:42.169 --> 02:59:43.769]  Remember, you can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.
[02:59:52.048 --> 02:59:55.654]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.654 --> 02:59:58.859]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:04.713 --> 03:00:07.636]  Okay, we're doing a little bit of overdrive here with Richard Reeves.
[03:00:07.636 --> 03:00:10.038]  I'm going to try to jam in a few of your calls here in just a moment.
[03:00:10.038 --> 03:00:21.550]  But Richard, when I ask you your opinion, and I respect and look for that opinion on the Ron Paul stuff, I understand you're obsessed with winning, so you want to start telling us how we can get Ron Paul in and delegate stuff.
[03:00:21.550 --> 03:00:25.033]  But the reason I got you on specifically was to comment on
[03:00:25.934 --> 03:00:35.837]  You know, your view of this, and I tend to agree with you, that's why Ron Paul may not do this, is because he wants to continue to campaign for liberty past him.
[03:00:35.837 --> 03:00:40.578]  As he said, he wants to change the course of this country, not just be president.
[03:00:40.578 --> 03:00:45.520]  That he's just basically trailblazing for us right now, and that he's not going to want to
[03:00:46.460 --> 03:00:52.372]  to start some third party that fizzles out, he's going to want to get everybody to basically take over the Republican Party.
[03:00:52.372 --> 03:00:56.741]  And that is happening to a great extent to the old line Republican's chagrin.
[03:00:58.092 --> 03:00:58.572]  It sure is.
[03:00:58.572 --> 03:01:01.295]  We saw that example in California.
[03:01:01.295 --> 03:01:06.999]  You and I talked earlier how they actually cancelled the Texas Republican straw poll.
[03:01:06.999 --> 03:01:11.182]  They cancelled the Texas Republican straw poll this year saying lack of interest.
[03:01:11.182 --> 03:01:17.607]  Come on now, we've got Rick Perry and Ron Paul, both Texas candidates, and there's supposedly a lack of interest.
[03:01:17.607 --> 03:01:20.290]  The powers that be are very concerned and worried.
[03:01:20.290 --> 03:01:24.293]  And one thing I looked at while you were discussing the situation with Herman Cain,
[03:01:24.793 --> 03:01:26.175]  A federal reserve answer
[03:01:47.336 --> 03:02:03.201]  I don't even know if it's possible at that late of a date, but if he were to do it or try to do it, it would be after the RNC, which puts us around September of 2012, and I'd have to do research to see if you can even get on the ballot at such a late time.
[03:02:03.201 --> 03:02:04.241]  We're talking about September 2012.
[03:02:04.241 --> 03:02:05.242]  Listen, listen.
[03:02:05.242 --> 03:02:06.522]  Richard, do research on that.
[03:02:06.522 --> 03:02:09.043]  We'll talk more about it later in the week or next week.
[03:02:09.043 --> 03:02:10.663]  Thank you, Richard Reeves.
[03:02:10.663 --> 03:02:12.484]  Let's go ahead and go to Bill in Maryland.
[03:02:12.484 --> 03:02:14.705]  Bill, you're on the air.
[03:02:14.705 --> 03:02:15.005]  Hey, Alex.
[03:02:16.866 --> 03:02:23.769]  If they run this guy against Obama, then it can be like they can run the whole election as a race card.
[03:02:23.769 --> 03:02:34.794]  Because they can say, well, if you don't like Obama, or you don't like Herman Cain, and you don't like black people, and you're not voting because you're black, they can make every issue about it a black thing.
[03:02:34.794 --> 03:02:41.057]  Plus, they could have one of their little political assassinations and site riots and all other kinds of stuff like that.
[03:02:41.789 --> 03:02:42.950]  No, you're absolutely right.
[03:02:42.950 --> 03:02:46.693]  I mean, now, if you don't like the weather, they say it's racist.
[03:02:46.693 --> 03:02:49.034]  If you have any opinion, like, I like mustard on that.
[03:02:49.034 --> 03:02:50.315]  They go, because you're racist?
[03:02:50.315 --> 03:02:57.621]  I mean, there was a guy in an ice cream cone outfit with sprinkles on, a Puerto Rican guy advertising an ice cream place, and it caused a giant hissy fit.
[03:02:57.621 --> 03:03:01.363]  I'm going to cover that more tonight, because they thought it was a Klan person.
[03:03:01.363 --> 03:03:08.209]  There's racial attacks all over the country, but it's done mainly against whites, because I guess it's seen that we're evil and deserve it.
[03:03:08.209 --> 03:03:09.650]  And AP was labeled racist.
[03:03:10.270 --> 03:03:24.273]  I'm going to cover this tonight with examples because Obama kind of talked in what I guess he thought was some weird urban dialect, just like all the other politicians do, whatever group they're talking to, to like make them like him.
[03:03:24.273 --> 03:03:28.353]  And it's not racist to transcribe what Obama actually said or did.
[03:03:28.353 --> 03:03:31.614]  So yes, I mean, this whole Herman Cain thing is a nightmare.
[03:03:31.614 --> 03:03:36.515]  I mean, why can't people support a black politician who's actually a patriot?
[03:03:36.515 --> 03:03:37.255]  I know they're out there.
[03:03:38.235 --> 03:03:47.419]  Uh, but, uh, I mean, Alan West was, you know, tries to sound like he's good, but he went along with the bailout, uh, you know, with the latest, uh, uh, uh, increase in, uh, the budget.
[03:03:47.419 --> 03:03:54.882]  And he's a big warmonger, but he's, he's a really, really smart guy, knows exactly what he's doing, very well spoken, charismatic.
[03:03:54.882 --> 03:04:00.225]  Uh, it's, it's, it's just terrible, but at least Kermit Cain doesn't play up race card stuff.
[03:04:00.225 --> 03:04:06.568]  Uh, but, but, but I do agree with you, the media would still do that.
[03:04:06.568 --> 03:04:07.308]  Anything else on that?
[03:04:08.699 --> 03:04:13.241]  Um, just like Bill Cosby, he would be like a black person that people could vote for.
[03:04:13.241 --> 03:04:14.401]  He would talk about issues.
[03:04:14.401 --> 03:04:20.544]  I mean, he probably wouldn't run for president, but there's black people out there that address issues.
[03:04:20.544 --> 03:04:23.325]  And, but I mean, like you said, it would be a nightmare.
[03:04:23.325 --> 03:04:28.587]  It's like it already plays into a false paradigm because as soon as you talk about it, you're a racist.
[03:04:28.587 --> 03:04:30.608]  Well, what if Ron Paul was black?
[03:04:30.608 --> 03:04:30.808]  Wow.
[03:04:33.508 --> 03:04:35.450]  Oh, man.
[03:04:35.450 --> 03:04:36.151]  Oh, gosh.
[03:04:36.151 --> 03:04:36.992]  All right.
[03:04:36.992 --> 03:04:38.093]  I appreciate your call.
[03:04:38.093 --> 03:04:39.814]  Look, I'm sorry everybody else.
[03:04:39.814 --> 03:04:43.297]  If Gary and Joel and Otter call in tomorrow, you can get in first.
[03:04:43.297 --> 03:04:49.023]  Like, I'll take calls tomorrow, so you can just call at the start of the show, you guys, and we'll go to you first.
[03:04:49.023 --> 03:04:50.004]  Great job to the crew.
[03:04:50.004 --> 03:04:54.488]  Hey, hey, check us out tonight, 7 o'clock, InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:04:54.488 --> 03:04:55.649]  It airs at PrisonPlanet.tv.
