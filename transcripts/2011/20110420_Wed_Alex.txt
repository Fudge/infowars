[00:00:05.148 --> 00:00:09.991]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.991 --> 00:00:11.572]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.572 --> 00:00:13.133]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:17.315]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.315 --> 00:00:21.378]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.703 --> 00:00:38.866]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:51.177]  It is the 20th day of April, 2011, on this live Wednesday edition, and we have a completely, totally jam-packed live broadcast for you today.
[00:00:51.177 --> 00:01:00.746]  Webster Tarpley joins us for 30 minutes of the next hour, at the start of the next hour, to break down the complete admissions, now that we are completely right, going back five, six weeks ago.
[00:01:01.627 --> 00:01:06.531]  That everything happening in the Middle East and North Africa is a staged globalist event.
[00:01:06.531 --> 00:01:11.354]  And now it's admitted in the LA Times, New York Times, that they're saying how wonderful it is.
[00:01:11.354 --> 00:01:15.317]  They're also saying that these are humanitarian bombs being dropped.
[00:01:15.317 --> 00:01:19.761]  I actually heard that on Fox News this morning, driving in, listening on XM.
[00:01:19.761 --> 00:01:24.925]  And I actually have the news article that 25 million from the U.S.
[00:01:24.925 --> 00:01:30.149]  is humanitarian, non-lethal support of the Al-Qaeda good guy rebels.
[00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:37.112]  I think they're the bad guys, but compared to Gaddafi, but you know, reality doesn't matter here.
[00:01:37.112 --> 00:01:44.895]  Lord Christopher Monckton is going to be joining us on the latest with the globalists trying to force their carbon tax dictatorship on the planet.
[00:01:44.895 --> 00:01:56.480]  And then also from Britannia, in the last 30 minutes of the third hour, Steve Watson, great writer, researcher, Paul Watson's brother, the team over at PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv,
[00:01:58.718 --> 00:02:01.942]  He himself has what a master's in political science.
[00:02:01.942 --> 00:02:06.186]  He'll be breaking down the royal wedding of all things.
[00:02:06.186 --> 00:02:08.468]  They said, come out.
[00:02:08.468 --> 00:02:15.796]  Demonstrations or even parades aren't really allowed, but the gracious queen to teach you to love the royal rats.
[00:02:20.676 --> 00:02:28.181]  Her demonic brood that sit on top of servile slaves come out and have street parties.
[00:02:28.181 --> 00:02:33.025]  And there's a national day off for the royalty because they're so wonderful.
[00:02:33.025 --> 00:02:35.886]  You slaves don't have to work on this holy day.
[00:02:35.886 --> 00:02:45.473]  And then the Republicans, a group that want to get rid of the royal monarchy, the disgusting monarchy in England that the Brits have tried to get rid of for 500 plus years.
[00:02:45.473 --> 00:02:46.874]  They said, well, we're going to demonstrate.
[00:02:46.874 --> 00:02:49.636]  And they said, oh, no, no demonstrations allowed.
[00:02:50.697 --> 00:02:52.377]  No demonstrations allowed!
[00:02:52.377 --> 00:03:01.459]  Meanwhile, the British government is decrying Assad, the dictator of Syria, because he's banned protest.
[00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:07.700]  Try protesting outside the Capitol at the park or at the mall in D.C.
[00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.161]  or at the Washington Monument.
[00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:10.441]  Try just standing there.
[00:03:10.441 --> 00:03:12.061]  Cops walk over and go, what are you doing?
[00:03:12.061 --> 00:03:14.722]  I'm just standing here, sitting here.
[00:03:14.722 --> 00:03:15.222]  Move along!
[00:03:15.998 --> 00:03:19.099]  You're trying to videotape, even with your family, they come over and get in your face.
[00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:21.060]  It's all about letting you know you're a slave.
[00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.161]  Hey, you don't pack lunches for your kids.
[00:03:23.161 --> 00:03:25.861]  You don't play dodgeball or baseball.
[00:03:25.861 --> 00:03:30.423]  You don't go through the airport without us sticking our hands down your pants.
[00:03:30.423 --> 00:03:33.764]  And by the way, we're gonna take your blood at checkpoints.
[00:03:33.764 --> 00:03:37.706]  I heard local radio this morning that I called into it.
[00:03:37.706 --> 00:03:41.147]  They were defending police taking blood warrantlessly.
[00:03:42.808 --> 00:04:00.135]  And I pointed out, well, they take baby's blood at birth and they went on to admit that they knew that baby's blood for 39 years, almost 40 is taken at birth in the entire Western world and put in a UN database, biological database.
[00:04:00.135 --> 00:04:01.776]  But one of the hosts went on to defend it.
[00:04:03.251 --> 00:04:05.632]  And some callers called in and called me a conspiracy theorist.
[00:04:05.632 --> 00:04:19.198]  I mean, they're admitting it's real, but because I don't like them taking baby's blood and lying about it for decades and putting it in secret databases and giving it to the insurance companies into genetic databases so they can deny you healthcare.
[00:04:19.198 --> 00:04:20.019]  Oh, that's all admitted.
[00:04:21.425 --> 00:04:26.987]  I'm the bad one, see, for telling the slaves about it, because the slaves don't want to hear.
[00:04:26.987 --> 00:04:30.329]  They want to get hurt, and so they're going to get hurt bad, don't worry.
[00:04:30.329 --> 00:04:38.692]  And all the control freaks that power the system, all the people that have a fetish for going along with being slaves, good, you're going to enjoy it.
[00:04:38.692 --> 00:04:41.574]  You will be judged by your own weakness.
[00:04:41.574 --> 00:04:44.175]  Okay, okay, I haven't even gotten into the news.
[00:04:44.175 --> 00:04:46.776]  It is every day getting crazier, you know that.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.942]  It's all coming up after this break.
[00:04:49.942 --> 00:04:52.924]  Complete total news blitz.
[00:04:52.924 --> 00:04:55.567]  The police, well, just wait till we get back.
[00:04:55.567 --> 00:04:58.850]  We already told you about this, but now the mainstream media admits it.
[00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:59.711]  Wait till you hear it.
[00:05:00.495 --> 00:05:04.318]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[00:05:04.318 --> 00:05:08.601]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[00:05:08.601 --> 00:05:13.265]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[00:05:13.265 --> 00:05:19.249]  Not looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:26.294]  Not worried about them moving south, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[00:05:29.025 --> 00:05:34.530]  I'm looking for America.
[00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.192]  Wear American and be proud.
[00:05:36.192 --> 00:05:38.795]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[00:05:38.795 --> 00:05:48.484]  The land I left free and the home of the brave seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[00:05:54.989 --> 00:06:00.613]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[00:06:00.613 --> 00:06:07.559]  Over the last year, Alex has told you about and many of you have experienced emergencies and disasters in unprecedented numbers.
[00:06:07.559 --> 00:06:10.201]  People have had to literally run for their lives.
[00:06:10.201 --> 00:06:12.643]  Folks, this is Steve Schenck with eFoods Direct.
[00:06:12.643 --> 00:06:17.026]  I'm not here to scare you, but when disaster strikes, you won't have time to think.
[00:06:17.026 --> 00:06:18.727]  You must act automatically.
[00:06:18.727 --> 00:06:22.250]  What does a pilot do when the helicopter engine fails in flight?
[00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.672]  No time to think, just act automatically.
[00:06:24.992 --> 00:06:33.360]  When the alert is broadcast, the alarm sounds, or the knock comes on your door, you'll need to be ready to act without thinking of what to do or what you need.
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.382]  You need a 5-Day Extreme Emergency Kit.
[00:06:36.382 --> 00:06:46.031]  With serious supplies and real food to secure 2 adults for 5 days, this powerful $300 Extreme Emergency Kit is free with an order of at least $995 from eFoodsDirect.
[00:06:48.353 --> 00:06:48.973]  We're good to go.
[00:07:04.284 --> 00:07:05.545]  Tyranny is here.
[00:07:05.545 --> 00:07:09.489]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:07:09.489 --> 00:07:11.731]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:07:11.731 --> 00:07:17.596]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[00:07:17.596 --> 00:07:23.822]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:07:24.242 --> 00:07:30.246]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:07:30.246 --> 00:07:34.409]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[00:07:34.409 --> 00:07:38.692]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:07:38.692 --> 00:07:44.637]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:07:44.637 --> 00:07:48.199]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:07:48.199 --> 00:07:50.180]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:50.621]  It's here.
[00:07:51.281 --> 00:07:58.086]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:08:05.325 --> 00:08:06.626]  Big Brother.
[00:08:06.626 --> 00:08:08.387]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.387 --> 00:08:10.149]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.149 --> 00:08:11.750]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:13.291]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.291 --> 00:08:17.475]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.475 --> 00:08:23.319]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:23.319 --> 00:08:33.307]  To say that we are overloaded with incredible news on every front, geopolitically, economically, militarily, is an understatement.
[00:08:35.322 --> 00:08:38.083]  We have a completely jam-packed broadcast today.
[00:08:38.083 --> 00:08:43.146]  It'll be tons of news across the board in the first hour.
[00:08:43.146 --> 00:08:45.707]  Into the second hour, we'll be taking your phone calls and more news.
[00:08:45.707 --> 00:08:49.629]  And Lord Christopher Monckton joins us, Webster Griffin, Tower Police Steve Watson.
[00:08:49.629 --> 00:08:54.151]  And I'll break down more of why those guests are joining us a little bit later in the hour.
[00:08:54.151 --> 00:08:59.054]  Now, you know syndicated columnist, former NSA officer,
[00:09:00.438 --> 00:09:04.299]  Wayne Madsen broke here on the show last week that he's having to leave the U.S.
[00:09:04.299 --> 00:09:18.464]  because he's been threatened through the State Department, through a major media outlet, and a foreign consulate that the White House is coming after him because he's been going to Chicago, Hawaii, other areas investigating who Obama, Barry Sotero, really is.
[00:09:18.464 --> 00:09:24.266]  Now he's leaving the country to write a book on it, but not just the birth certificate issue, the CIA background.
[00:09:24.266 --> 00:09:27.127]  And he did give up his citizenship and did become Barry Sotero.
[00:09:27.127 --> 00:09:28.288]  Those documents have been released.
[00:09:29.168 --> 00:09:40.754]  Drudge's headline, we're going to get this mirrored up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, missing records in Hawaii, missing records in Kenya, missing records in Indonesia.
[00:09:40.754 --> 00:09:45.896]  And that's what Corsi found when he got detained by the police when he went to Kenya.
[00:09:45.896 --> 00:09:47.437]  That's what Madsen is finding.
[00:09:47.437 --> 00:09:50.058]  And of course, Madsen is going to Indonesia.
[00:09:50.058 --> 00:09:51.419]  He's coming here first.
[00:09:51.419 --> 00:09:53.060]  So Madsen's also on this.
[00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:54.180]  This is the real deal.
[00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:55.481]  And this is dangerous.
[00:09:56.161 --> 00:09:57.022]  This is dangerous.
[00:09:57.022 --> 00:10:02.628]  I mean, everyone in his family we've looked at is admitted above CIA.
[00:10:02.628 --> 00:10:07.954]  I mean, OSS before CIA, Ford Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation.
[00:10:07.954 --> 00:10:11.317]  I mean, they are the real deal.
[00:10:11.317 --> 00:10:14.040]  This guy is a complete government manufactured creature.
[00:10:15.141 --> 00:10:16.642]  Western intelligence has been caught.
[00:10:16.642 --> 00:10:19.004]  The Russians were big on this and still are.
[00:10:19.004 --> 00:10:22.267]  Getting young people in countries, positioning them as agents.
[00:10:22.267 --> 00:10:24.428]  Things like Kevin Costner's no way out.
[00:10:24.428 --> 00:10:27.210]  That's very accurate from the Russian perspective.
[00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:28.011]  Very accurate.
[00:10:28.011 --> 00:10:30.693]  Real things like that are on record happening.
[00:10:30.693 --> 00:10:38.499]  If you think the Russians are doing it, you think the globalists that run America are doing it, Obama is a totally compromised, not even blackmailed,
[00:10:39.079 --> 00:10:40.100]  You don't have to blackmail him.
[00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:43.682]  He is their creation, trained from a baby.
[00:10:43.682 --> 00:10:45.843]  And the evidence is all there, it's legion.
[00:10:45.843 --> 00:10:47.364]  Webster Griffin Tarpley really...
[00:10:48.499 --> 00:10:49.720]  We, by the way, sell these books.
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.822]  I'm not poo-pooing Tarpley's.
[00:10:52.822 --> 00:10:55.904]  I'm not poo-pooing Jerome R. Corsi, Dr. Corsi's book.
[00:10:55.904 --> 00:11:00.166]  But we've interviewed Corsi, and we know a lot of what's in the book, and Drudge has got a boil down on it.
[00:11:00.166 --> 00:11:03.288]  And he is respected, and he's doing original research, and that's great.
[00:11:03.288 --> 00:11:10.873]  But Webster Griffin Tarpley, a year before Obama got elected, started writing his Barack H. Obama, The Unauthorized Biography.
[00:11:12.822 --> 00:11:16.103]  It's got everything in it, everything that's since come out.
[00:11:16.103 --> 00:11:20.284]  Of course, he wrote the original George Herbert Walker books, The Unauthorized Biography.
[00:11:20.284 --> 00:11:24.706]  And those are all available at InfoWars.com, I should add, if you want to support us and Tarpley.
[00:11:24.706 --> 00:11:29.807]  And then he wrote another subsequent book about Obama's criminal activities right as he got elected, predicting what he would do.
[00:11:29.807 --> 00:11:38.050]  And we put a lot of that in my film, the seminal film, seen more than 30 million times online, The Obama Deception, now more pertinent than ever.
[00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:41.011]  But we're going to be going over that today, also Donald Trump,
[00:11:42.666 --> 00:11:42.947]  I don't
[00:11:53.638 --> 00:11:54.639]  Going over that report.
[00:11:54.639 --> 00:11:57.982]  Cuba lays the foundation for a new leader.
[00:11:57.982 --> 00:11:59.363]  That's a big deal.
[00:11:59.363 --> 00:12:03.827]  Cesium-137 threat grows while corporate media remains mute.
[00:12:03.827 --> 00:12:07.050]  The levels are going up and up and up and up in North America.
[00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:08.551]  And the feds aren't releasing numbers.
[00:12:08.551 --> 00:12:10.433]  States are releasing numbers.
[00:12:10.433 --> 00:12:13.075]  181 times for one isotope.
[00:12:13.075 --> 00:12:13.856]  Then 300 plus.
[00:12:13.856 --> 00:12:14.296]  Then 500 plus.
[00:12:14.296 --> 00:12:16.118]  Because it's just building up.
[00:12:16.118 --> 00:12:18.660]  Now the Japanese government a few weeks ago said it may go for months.
[00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:19.341]  Then six months.
[00:12:19.341 --> 00:12:20.282]  Then nine months.
[00:12:21.311 --> 00:12:31.441]  Now they're saying maybe years that five of the six reactors are just going to smoke and continue to melt down and burn and belch out radioactive death.
[00:12:32.634 --> 00:12:39.337]  At 7.5 million times ABC News reported three weeks ago normal levels.
[00:12:39.337 --> 00:12:40.417]  7.5 million.
[00:12:40.417 --> 00:12:52.722]  Washington Post interviewed radiation specialists who said five hours at the level that it was being released in just one measurement at Fukushima would roughly kill half the people that came in contact with it within a month.
[00:12:52.722 --> 00:12:54.383]  The rest will be dead within a few years.
[00:12:54.383 --> 00:12:56.424]  Birth defects off the charts.
[00:12:56.424 --> 00:12:59.005]  Guaranteed from examples we've seen like Chernobyl.
[00:13:00.669 --> 00:13:00.949]  Are you
[00:13:18.197 --> 00:13:24.580]  Humans tend to muddle through things, and the globalists know this, so they can get away with bloody murder.
[00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:25.801]  Nobody will get in trouble.
[00:13:25.801 --> 00:13:30.143]  General Electric, even though their own engineers quit when these were built, saying they were dangerous.
[00:13:30.143 --> 00:13:31.824]  They're not going to get in trouble.
[00:13:31.824 --> 00:13:34.245]  In fact, they run the White House.
[00:13:34.245 --> 00:13:35.746]  They don't have to pay taxes, nothing.
[00:13:36.696 --> 00:13:55.828]  So it's how it works and they're openly funding through George Soros and others the groups pushing to rob what's left the middle class that won't even pay for a few months of government operation but their enemy will be gone and the giant blue collar mass is out there on average I've seen the polls saying slit the throat of the middle class and then they won't be there anymore to
[00:13:56.488 --> 00:14:03.890]  Get their hair cut by them, or get their car fixed by them, or go to the golf course and be caddied for them, or buy clothes, or go to their restaurant.
[00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:05.510]  But that's what you want, what you get.
[00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:07.971]  You want to live like they do in the third world?
[00:14:07.971 --> 00:14:16.013]  I mean, the globalists went into Argentina, the old saying, as rich as in Argentina, until about 80 years ago, Argentina was more wealthy than the U.S.
[00:14:16.013 --> 00:14:17.693]  per capita.
[00:14:17.693 --> 00:14:23.355]  Back per capita, the wealthiest country in the world for the average citizen, except for Switzerland.
[00:14:24.565 --> 00:14:42.012]  And of course Switzerland, low taxes, free market, handing out machine guns and hand grenades to every man and woman, giant underground bases for the entire population, and a total republic that our founders actually modelled us after Switzerland and the old system they had in the Netherlands, that's now gone, than the Greeks.
[00:14:42.012 --> 00:14:43.953]  We're told we're modelled after the Greeks.
[00:14:43.953 --> 00:14:45.394]  It ain't true!
[00:14:45.394 --> 00:14:47.595]  We're modelled after the Swiss and the Dutch.
[00:14:47.595 --> 00:14:49.996]  Go read what the founders said and then go research what they've got.
[00:14:51.383 --> 00:14:57.928]  Oh, you go back 300, 400 years ago, the Dutch would get robbed by pirates on their big wealthy shipyard and trade centers.
[00:14:57.928 --> 00:15:04.913]  So they just organized local militias with their own cannons and muskets and trained them.
[00:15:04.913 --> 00:15:14.860]  And part of working in the shipyards or in the dikes or in those loaders at those warehouses was you had to be ready to be called up by the local private militia.
[00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:19.023]  And people that had houses on the coast, they cut out big walls, put cannons in,
[00:15:20.162 --> 00:15:23.464]  Of course, they've taken that away from the Dutch now, but the Swiss still have it.
[00:15:23.464 --> 00:15:27.366]  If you really want to study it, the Swiss have the Dutch model, and then we've got the Swiss model.
[00:15:27.366 --> 00:15:29.528]  But again, let's not actually know history.
[00:15:29.528 --> 00:15:31.609]  Let's not be as rich as a Swiss.
[00:15:31.609 --> 00:15:33.930]  Let's not be as rich as an Argentine.
[00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:37.693]  Oh, the Argentinians, they let the bankers come in in the 70s and they had a coup.
[00:15:38.573 --> 00:15:41.834]  And they rounded up and killed tens of thousands, arrested hundreds of thousands.
[00:15:41.834 --> 00:15:43.735]  Pinochet took over September 11th.
[00:15:43.735 --> 00:15:45.796]  If you pull up the date, I forget the exact year.
[00:15:45.796 --> 00:15:47.937]  Pull that up for me, please.
[00:15:47.937 --> 00:15:52.119]  And Henry Kissinger helped back all that, and then they robbed everybody.
[00:15:52.119 --> 00:15:55.360]  And then, of course, 2000, they did the same thing again.
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:16:01.063]  They got them to dollarize their currency, and then they imploded it overnight, just like we're entering.
[00:16:01.063 --> 00:16:03.964]  And then the whole economy falls apart, and the bankers can come in and take over.
[00:16:03.964 --> 00:16:06.565]  All right, now I'm ranting.
[00:16:06.565 --> 00:16:07.686]  I'm actually ranting now.
[00:16:09.135 --> 00:16:16.039]  Let me just, never been successful doing this, let's see if I can do it right now.
[00:16:16.039 --> 00:16:18.481]  Let me just read to you randomly the stacks.
[00:16:18.481 --> 00:16:23.383]  Well, I mean, the stacks all have their basic information, but just the stacks, because I don't even know where to go first.
[00:16:23.383 --> 00:16:33.349]  I actually do, but, okay, cops use mobile scanners to steal cell phone data from innocent Americans, and the system they admit hacks your phone.
[00:16:34.346 --> 00:16:38.730]  When the cop pulls you over, they've got a machine, and I told you this years ago, it's what the Google trucks do.
[00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:48.719]  They're now, under Homeland Security, putting these into all, well they've announced they're going to put them into all of the mailmen delivery trucks.
[00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:50.561]  I was just politically incorrect.
[00:16:50.561 --> 00:16:51.381]  I'm going to say it again.
[00:16:51.381 --> 00:16:52.422]  Mailman trucks.
[00:16:52.422 --> 00:16:54.163]  You don't like that, do you, Sovietizers?
[00:16:54.163 --> 00:16:54.904]  I'll say what I want.
[00:16:54.904 --> 00:16:58.867]  I don't care if a man or a woman's driving, and I'm going to call it mailman because you don't like it.
[00:16:58.867 --> 00:17:00.128]  The mail person truck.
[00:17:00.128 --> 00:17:01.569]  There, I behaved myself.
[00:17:01.569 --> 00:17:07.693]  The mailman, they're attaching these systems to them to grab your digital data.
[00:17:07.693 --> 00:17:08.594]  That came out.
[00:17:08.594 --> 00:17:10.095]  Google's doing it all over the world.
[00:17:10.095 --> 00:17:11.476]  They are an arm of the NSA.
[00:17:14.002 --> 00:17:14.343]  I think
[00:17:30.501 --> 00:17:41.227]  The phone opens, your emails, your photos, your surfing history, and by the way, it's not just the state police doing this in Michigan.
[00:17:41.227 --> 00:17:47.370]  The state police, but limited units are being given the systems through the Threat Fusion Homeland Security Training Command bases.
[00:17:49.102 --> 00:17:51.583]  As they dole out these systems.
[00:17:51.583 --> 00:17:54.745]  I remember 2003, it's in Matrix of Evil.
[00:17:54.745 --> 00:17:59.847]  It was in the Green Bay paper that the governor kind of slipped up at a tour of a threat fusion center.
[00:17:59.847 --> 00:18:07.011]  And he said, yeah, we can just dial in their social security number or driver's license here and find them in real time via their cell phone with GPS.
[00:18:07.011 --> 00:18:09.392]  We can also hit this button and listen to them.
[00:18:09.392 --> 00:18:11.253]  And the state police were like, no, governor.
[00:18:11.253 --> 00:18:12.314]  I mean, this came out.
[00:18:12.314 --> 00:18:12.694]  Don't don't.
[00:18:13.514 --> 00:18:17.178]  Well, the Austin police can just sit there with the special units they've got.
[00:18:17.178 --> 00:18:18.639]  The other slave cops don't know.
[00:18:18.639 --> 00:18:19.941]  They haven't been told yet.
[00:18:19.941 --> 00:18:22.103]  And they just dial right in, grab your whole phone.
[00:18:22.103 --> 00:18:23.084]  Totally illegal.
[00:18:23.084 --> 00:18:23.604]  They don't care.
[00:18:23.604 --> 00:18:24.786]  They got the weapons.
[00:18:24.786 --> 00:18:27.048]  State police in Texas have got it.
[00:18:27.048 --> 00:18:35.456]  They've got laser couplers that you can't even see unless it's a foggy evening where they can laser your window and it gives them unbelievable sound inside your house.
[00:18:35.456 --> 00:18:35.897]  It acts as a
[00:18:36.617 --> 00:18:36.977]  I don't
[00:19:01.653 --> 00:19:01.833]  I think?
[00:19:23.522 --> 00:19:26.226]  I read one article.
[00:19:26.226 --> 00:19:29.610]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, Paul Watson.
[00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:36.939]  And by the way, people who think we exaggerate, Paul Watson's article is excellent and more expansive than CNET, AP, and Reuters.
[00:19:38.968 --> 00:19:40.329]  It's nothing.
[00:19:40.329 --> 00:19:44.631]  I actually, this morning, spent about 30 minutes reading the full documents.
[00:19:44.631 --> 00:19:49.694]  And this is not cops use mobile scanner to steal cell phone data from innocent Americans.
[00:19:49.694 --> 00:19:56.377]  It should be cops use NSA system to hack phones, steal all data.
[00:19:56.377 --> 00:19:57.198]  Total Orwell.
[00:19:59.778 --> 00:20:00.758]  Drink your fluoride!

[00:20:30.208 --> 00:20:39.474]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:20:39.534 --> 00:20:46.598]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:20:46.598 --> 00:20:47.459]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:20:47.459 --> 00:20:50.721]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[00:20:50.721 --> 00:20:51.541]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.

[00:21:23.216 --> 00:21:24.797]  Loan modification is a joke.
[00:21:24.797 --> 00:21:28.398]  The banks use that to take your money with nothing in return and keeping you in default.
[00:21:28.618 --> 00:21:29.760]  You've heard our ad before.

[00:21:51.851 --> 00:21:53.333]  Guaranteed to stop foreclosure.
[00:21:53.333 --> 00:21:54.454]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:22:01.863 --> 00:22:17.407]  The earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear disaster that killed thousands of Japanese citizens is nothing compared to the devastation that could be caused by hyperinflation that will soon hit the United States and could lead to millions of Americans becoming homeless, all caused by the devalued U.S.
[00:22:17.407 --> 00:22:17.747]  dollar.
[00:22:17.747 --> 00:22:27.470]  While the mainstream media continues to ignore inflation, our friends at the National Inflation Association provide a free weekly newsletter that educates Americans of the facts and truth about the U.S.
[00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:28.410]  economy and inflation.
[00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:38.763]  I urge you to sign up at the NIA's free newsletter at www.inflation.us to learn how you can not only survive, but prosper during the upcoming hyperinflation crisis.
[00:22:38.763 --> 00:22:44.350]  Silver has more than doubled since the NIA declared silver the best investment for the next decade on inflation.us.
[00:22:45.151 --> 00:22:54.619]  The NIA's team of expert economists are happy to answer any economic questions you have about inflation, debt, currencies, real estate, precious metals, and commodities.
[00:22:54.619 --> 00:22:59.584]  Visit inflation.us to learn the economic truth that the mainstream media ignores.
[00:23:01.997 --> 00:23:04.079]  Are you still a traditional smoker?

[00:23:44.788 --> 00:23:44.968]  That's 870-518-4307.
[00:23:51.451 --> 00:23:53.131]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:14.321 --> 00:24:16.402]  And I just read one of the headlines there.
[00:24:16.402 --> 00:24:24.587]  When I come back in the next segment, this is a short one, I'm going to go through these in detail, but let me just start getting into the headlines now.
[00:24:24.587 --> 00:24:28.449]  Reverend Al Sharpton joins President Obama's immigration reform effort.
[00:24:28.449 --> 00:24:36.293]  That means stirring up the giant army of foreigners that have been taught to hate America to be used as a political weapon for the banksters to make sure the middle class is destroyed.
[00:24:38.188 --> 00:24:42.191]  Banksters always have the communist hordes working for them.
[00:24:42.191 --> 00:24:51.577]  Well, when the air traffic controllers aren't watching movies or sleeping, I mean, this is government.
[00:24:51.577 --> 00:24:56.841]  What do you expect?
[00:24:56.841 --> 00:24:59.222]  Make it legal, and then people won't want to use it.
[00:24:59.222 --> 00:25:00.063]  Every study shows.
[00:25:00.063 --> 00:25:01.404]  And the cops won't be corrupt anymore.
[00:25:02.978 --> 00:25:12.269]  But they first got the cops under prohibition accustomed to something being illegal that everybody wanted and they could feel good about getting paid off about people being able to have a drink.
[00:25:12.269 --> 00:25:19.257]  So right after they lost prohibition of alcohol they made the drugs illegal that you could buy at the corner store.
[00:25:19.257 --> 00:25:20.559]  And then of course drug use exploded.
[00:25:20.559 --> 00:25:22.161]  Oh, side issue.
[00:25:22.161 --> 00:25:23.062]  Continuing here.
[00:25:24.619 --> 00:25:28.902]  Libyan rebels will receive 25 million from the U.S.
[00:25:28.902 --> 00:25:31.084]  and they're calling it non-lethal aid.
[00:25:31.084 --> 00:25:34.646]  Yes, the bombs dropping, the weapons being shipped in by the U.S.
[00:25:34.646 --> 00:25:35.747]  and England.
[00:25:35.747 --> 00:25:39.650]  Since before this started, the special forces on the ground, lazing targets.
[00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:41.271]  It's non-violent.
[00:25:41.271 --> 00:25:42.912]  And this is not a war.
[00:25:42.912 --> 00:25:47.415]  Arab Spring setbacks in the shadow of complicated U.S.-Saudi alliance.
[00:25:47.415 --> 00:25:50.838]  The Saudis are beginning to panic and realize they're being double-crossed.
[00:25:50.838 --> 00:25:53.520]  Webster Tarpeh is going to break that down for us at the beginning of the next hour.
[00:25:55.689 --> 00:25:59.931]  That's just some of the news that we have on that front.
[00:25:59.931 --> 00:26:09.134]  France vows to step up airstrikes in Libya because their darling little rebels have been failing now for many, many weeks in their attacks.
[00:26:09.134 --> 00:26:13.136]  Also, officials again to give Libyan rebels non-lethal aid.
[00:26:13.136 --> 00:26:15.617]  There's the actual headline from the Associated Press.
[00:26:16.978 --> 00:26:20.841]  Syria lifts emergency law, sets new curbs on protest.
[00:26:20.841 --> 00:26:23.123]  The media is decrying it.
[00:26:23.123 --> 00:26:27.165]  Financial Times of London says anger as Assad curbs right to protest.
[00:26:27.165 --> 00:26:31.549]  But England itself has banned the right to protest unless you get a special permit.
[00:26:31.549 --> 00:26:41.055]  And then even when you do, one poor guy at the G20 was trying to deliver newspapers to a 7-Eleven type store and the cops beat him to death and then covered it up.
[00:26:41.055 --> 00:26:41.876]  And then later admitted it.
[00:26:44.108 --> 00:26:50.271]  Another key article here from PrisonPlanet.com, Libyan rebels fighting the globalist war.
[00:26:50.271 --> 00:26:56.053]  And then something that does irritate me about Islamic countries, I will say is a bad sign.
[00:26:56.053 --> 00:27:06.017]  Something I don't like about Islam, and this is actually true from my research, Iran is moving to try to ban dogs and harass dog owners.
[00:27:06.017 --> 00:27:06.978]  And you know what?
[00:27:09.898 --> 00:27:12.660]  I'll keep my dogs, thank you very much.
[00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:15.241]  And that's all I have to say.
[00:27:15.241 --> 00:27:20.184]  The latest enemies of Iran, dogs and their owners.
[00:27:20.184 --> 00:27:23.286]  Now that doesn't mean Iran should be bombed into the Stone Age.
[00:27:23.286 --> 00:27:28.129]  You know, the globalists put poison in our water and the globalists want to sterilize us.
[00:27:28.129 --> 00:27:30.751]  The Iranian control freaks just don't want you to have a dog.
[00:27:32.073 --> 00:27:35.094]  For much of the past decade, oh, by the way, the Communist Chinese don't like it either.
[00:27:35.094 --> 00:27:38.395]  They're trying to make Chinese give up their dogs.
[00:27:38.395 --> 00:27:41.135]  I guess because Mao Zedong's favorite dish was boiled dog.
[00:27:41.135 --> 00:27:42.275]  I'm not joking.
[00:27:42.275 --> 00:27:45.536]  The Chinese astronauts to, quote, keep their energy up, eat dog.
[00:27:45.536 --> 00:27:46.296]  Don't believe me, guys?
[00:27:46.296 --> 00:27:50.157]  Google Chinese astronauts eat dog to keep their energy up.
[00:27:50.157 --> 00:27:51.398]  I believe it's BBC.
[00:27:51.398 --> 00:27:52.918]  Shows them eating dog.
[00:27:52.918 --> 00:28:00.380]  For much of the past decade, the Iranian government has tolerated what considers a particularly depraved and un-Islamic vice, the keeping of pet dogs.
[00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:03.621]  Okay.
[00:28:03.621 --> 00:28:07.142]  I'll not be joining your club anytime soon.
[00:28:07.142 --> 00:28:09.742]  Stay away from my dogs.
[00:28:09.742 --> 00:28:11.363]  I wonder what Muslims think about this.
[00:28:11.363 --> 00:28:14.744]  I mean, dogs are dirty and evil.
[00:28:14.744 --> 00:28:25.346]  Really, all the big studies show the keeping of dogs increases your immune system because it's a zoological buffer and also relaxes the heart and it's just a great thing.
[00:28:25.346 --> 00:28:27.367]  I'm gonna keep my French Bulldog and Chihuahua.
[00:28:28.044 --> 00:28:35.229]  I'm going to hug them, and I'm gonna pat them on the head, and they're gonna snuggle me while I sit there at the computer, okay?
[00:28:35.229 --> 00:28:37.290]  Period, not taking them, sorry.
[00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:41.373]  In fact, we'll put it, and by the way, the Communist Chinese, you're not gonna eat my dogs either.
[00:28:41.373 --> 00:28:44.575]  And folks in Mexico, you're not getting my dogs for taco meat.
[00:28:44.575 --> 00:28:46.657]  A dog, oh, believe me, I've been in Southern Mexico.
[00:28:46.657 --> 00:28:50.039]  You can go to the local grocery stores, they have dogs and cats, very delicious.
[00:28:50.039 --> 00:28:57.344]  Dogs on the menu for Chinese astronauts, China's first man in space, they said the Chinese astronauts eat dog meal
[00:28:58.479 --> 00:29:00.220]  Look how healthy he looks from eating dog.
[00:29:13.519 --> 00:29:17.383]  I see the Aztecs as having a depraved, wicked culture that I wouldn't want to be part of.
[00:29:17.383 --> 00:29:25.110]  But the globalists tell you you're not allowed to make a cultural statement about what culture is superior, or certain areas of a culture are more superior than others.
[00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:28.874]  Some cultures are varied, have things I like, things I don't like.
[00:29:28.874 --> 00:29:31.176]  But of course you've got to make a moral judgment about a culture.
[00:29:31.937 --> 00:29:37.499]  The globalists just don't want you to have a decision or to have a view so they can tell you what to think.
[00:29:37.499 --> 00:29:46.282]  Well, I'll keep my 1776 red-blooded, dog-owning, gun-owning, red-meat-eating culture.
[00:29:46.282 --> 00:29:49.063]  You know, fast cars.
[00:29:49.063 --> 00:29:50.924]  You name it, I'll keep it.
[00:29:50.924 --> 00:29:52.325]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.325 --> 00:29:54.866]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.866 --> 00:29:57.527]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.742 --> 00:30:02.384]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.

[00:30:22.062 --> 00:30:24.725]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[00:30:24.725 --> 00:30:31.230]  Since 1947, Calbin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:32.752]  Buy American and stay clean.

[00:30:52.368 --> 00:30:52.648]  Thank you!
[00:31:00.233 --> 00:31:04.776]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:31:04.776 --> 00:31:05.697]  Number 1.
[00:31:05.697 --> 00:31:09.119]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:31:09.119 --> 00:31:09.980]  Number 2.
[00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:14.863]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:31:14.863 --> 00:31:15.623]  It's true.
[00:31:15.623 --> 00:31:20.487]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:31:20.487 --> 00:31:21.307]  Number 3.
[00:31:21.307 --> 00:31:24.889]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:31:24.889 --> 00:31:28.612]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:31:28.792 --> 00:31:29.593]  Number 4.
[00:31:29.593 --> 00:31:32.356]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:31:32.356 --> 00:31:36.040]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:36.820]  Number 5.
[00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:40.985]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:31:40.985 --> 00:31:45.750]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:50.192]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:50.192 --> 00:31:51.974]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:51.974 --> 00:31:54.235]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:31:54.235 --> 00:31:56.576]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:07.295]  Over the last year, Alex has told you about and many of you have experienced emergencies and disasters in unprecedented numbers.
[00:32:07.295 --> 00:32:09.937]  People have had to literally run for their lives.
[00:32:09.937 --> 00:32:12.379]  Folks, this is Steve Schenck with eFoods Direct.
[00:32:12.379 --> 00:32:16.763]  I'm not here to scare you, but when disaster strikes, you won't have time to think.
[00:32:16.763 --> 00:32:18.224]  You must act automatically.
[00:32:18.464 --> 00:32:21.968]  What does a pilot do when the helicopter engine fails in flight?
[00:32:21.968 --> 00:32:24.731]  No time to think, just act automatically.
[00:32:24.731 --> 00:32:33.101]  When the alert is broadcast, the alarm sounds, or the knock comes on your door, you'll need to be ready to act without thinking of what to do or what you need.
[00:32:33.101 --> 00:32:35.864]  You need a 5-Day Extreme Emergency Kit.
[00:32:36.124 --> 00:32:45.814]  With serious supplies and real food to secure two adults for five days, this powerful $300 Extreme Emergency Kit is free with an order of at least $995 from eFoodsDirect.
[00:32:45.814 --> 00:32:47.976]  Go to eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex or call 800-409-5633.
[00:32:47.976 --> 00:32:50.399]  That's eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex, 800-409-5633.
[00:33:03.905 --> 00:33:04.885]  Big Brother.
[00:33:04.885 --> 00:33:06.546]  Mainstream media.
[00:33:06.546 --> 00:33:07.947]  Government cover-ups.
[00:33:07.947 --> 00:33:09.207]  You want answers?
[00:33:09.207 --> 00:33:11.288]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:11.288 --> 00:33:15.190]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:24.754 --> 00:33:27.176]  What do you mean I don't support your system?
[00:33:27.176 --> 00:33:28.837]  I gotta court when I have to.
[00:33:28.837 --> 00:33:31.679]  What do you mean?
[00:33:31.679 --> 00:33:36.943]  What do you mean I can't get to work on time?
[00:33:36.943 --> 00:33:40.906]  What do you mean I don't pay my bills?
[00:33:40.906 --> 00:33:41.847]  Why do you think?
[00:33:41.847 --> 00:33:43.709]  Why do you think I'm broke?
[00:33:43.709 --> 00:33:46.310]  Here it comes!
[00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:48.972]  Is there a new way?
[00:33:48.972 --> 00:33:50.434]  I'll be the first in line.
[00:33:50.434 --> 00:33:51.995]  I'll be the first in line.
[00:33:53.826 --> 00:33:57.148]  I'm gonna say hi to Dave out there listening.
[00:33:57.148 --> 00:34:03.193]  I know Dave doesn't mind we play his great music.
[00:34:03.193 --> 00:34:08.156]  I'm sure he hates me singing along with it though.
[00:34:08.156 --> 00:34:12.440]  Didn't know you had any feelings.
[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:13.400]  Just not your kind.
[00:34:17.117 --> 00:34:21.383]  What do you mean I couldn't be the President of the United States of America?
[00:34:21.383 --> 00:34:27.753]  Tell you something, it's still we, the people.
[00:34:41.363 --> 00:34:43.604]  Peace sells, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:43.604 --> 00:34:45.604]  They're bringing peace to Libya.
[00:34:45.604 --> 00:34:47.365]  Love bombs.
[00:34:47.365 --> 00:34:49.046]  Love troops.
[00:34:49.046 --> 00:34:51.247]  It's not a ground force.
[00:34:51.247 --> 00:34:52.647]  More landing every day.
[00:34:52.647 --> 00:34:57.609]  Peace sells.
[00:34:57.609 --> 00:35:00.130]  Oh, yes.
[00:35:00.130 --> 00:35:02.351]  In fact, now that we're rolling with this, let's just go a little bit further.
[00:35:02.351 --> 00:35:02.851]  Crank it up.
[00:35:13.937 --> 00:35:18.360]  It's hard to turn that off, isn't it?
[00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:20.302]  People don't get it, they just don't get it.
[00:35:20.302 --> 00:35:26.586]  Some people have got their fingers in their ears.
[00:35:26.586 --> 00:35:26.986]  Peace!
[00:35:26.986 --> 00:35:27.707]  Peace!
[00:35:27.707 --> 00:35:34.092]  Peaces!
[00:35:34.092 --> 00:35:34.872]  Oh, the U.N.
[00:35:34.872 --> 00:35:35.773]  They're going to save us.
[00:35:35.773 --> 00:35:37.294]  They're very loving.
[00:35:37.294 --> 00:35:38.375]  Have you looked into what the U.N.
[00:35:38.375 --> 00:35:39.596]  does in every country they invade?
[00:35:43.929 --> 00:35:45.690]  Oh, yes.
[00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:49.432]  They land aircraft and pick up the small children and fly them out.
[00:35:49.432 --> 00:35:50.452]  Oh, that's all over the news.
[00:35:50.452 --> 00:35:51.233]  We pull up articles.
[00:35:51.233 --> 00:35:59.837]  Crank it!
[00:35:59.837 --> 00:36:06.361]  Okay, I'm teleporting back to age 14.
[00:36:06.361 --> 00:36:06.781]  Excuse me.
[00:36:11.049 --> 00:36:17.810]  All right, I gotta have some fun here every once in a while.
[00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:21.131]  Gallows humor, as they say.
[00:36:21.131 --> 00:36:23.111]  All right, why am I so upset today?
[00:36:23.111 --> 00:36:30.052]  I had Webster Griffin Tarpley joining us, a doctor of history and also an economist.
[00:36:30.052 --> 00:36:39.694]  Lord Christopher Monckton, peer of the realm, will also be joining us to get into the latest global warming fraud in his standing for the Scottish Parliament.
[00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:51.534]  We've also, of course, got Steve Watson joining us from Britannia as well via video connection from London, New World Order Command Base Central.
[00:36:51.534 --> 00:37:06.941]  And I'm going to be breaking down the latest incredible admissions of the ongoing intensification of the ground build-up and offensive in eastern Libya against Muammar Gaddafi, the individual dumb enough to make a deal with the globalists six years ago to be friendly.
[00:37:08.442 --> 00:37:11.623]  That was just so they could get their spies in place for what's now happening.
[00:37:11.623 --> 00:37:15.884]  The mainstream media admitting that the West has orchestrated the entire Arab Spring.
[00:37:15.884 --> 00:37:23.346]  The Saudi Arabians have figured this out and are freaking out and cutting oil production in a desperate gambit to try to get the globalists to back off.
[00:37:23.346 --> 00:37:27.647]  The globalists could care less and love the destabilization.
[00:37:27.647 --> 00:37:33.149]  They're rootless, they're cunning, they're evil, and if you won't wake up and grow up, folks, you're defenseless against them.
[00:37:33.732 --> 00:37:54.887]  The minute you call them on being a bunch of sociopathic, blood-sucking, parasitical worms in fancy suits reading off teleprompters, it's game over for the scum when you learn to love your country and hate your government as Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin and George Washington and, well, Andrew Jackson.
[00:37:56.508 --> 00:38:24.811]  As soon as you rediscover common sense, as soon as you rediscover liberty and freedom, as soon as you rediscovered red-blooded behavior, all the scum, all the perching vultures of the nanny-state-control-freakdom-prison-political-correct-grid become, in your eyes, the little chicken-necked, two-inch-tall, weak, pus-filled maggot droppings that they are.
[00:38:26.724 --> 00:38:36.815]  The minute you see these pus-filled, carpet-bagging, global ringwraiths for what they are, you can just brush them aside.
[00:38:36.815 --> 00:38:43.562]  But right now they're trying to break your will all over the country banning dodgeball.
[00:38:43.562 --> 00:38:45.144]  Tag.
[00:38:45.144 --> 00:38:46.165]  Capture the flag.
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:48.861]  Softball.
[00:38:48.861 --> 00:38:52.782]  The government's now coming into softball leagues saying it's too dangerous, you can't do it.
[00:38:52.782 --> 00:38:59.545]  They're now coming in saying you gotta have special federal, state-approved licensing to have a swim team.
[00:38:59.545 --> 00:39:07.489]  You've gotta have a special federal license to own cows, or to have your own property, or to raise chickens, or to have a garden in your backyard.
[00:39:07.489 --> 00:39:10.550]  You've gotta have city inspections.
[00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:12.011]  Amish have gotta be raided.
[00:39:13.032 --> 00:39:14.993]  People selling tomatoes on the roadside.
[00:39:14.993 --> 00:39:19.437]  SWAT teams, undercover, hitting them, hitting them hard.
[00:39:19.437 --> 00:39:21.699]  Little girls can't sell lemonade on the street corner.
[00:39:21.699 --> 00:39:24.200]  Girl scouts can't sell them door-to-door.
[00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:25.501]  All over the country.
[00:39:25.501 --> 00:39:28.824]  Parents can't pack lunches for their parents.
[00:39:28.824 --> 00:39:30.565]  Parents can't pack lunches for their parents.
[00:39:30.565 --> 00:39:32.387]  Parents can't pack lunches for their children.
[00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:44.404]  It's all about breaking your will and just absurdly running over you, but the control freaks, the scientific criminal engineers, know exactly what they're doing.
[00:39:44.404 --> 00:39:59.190]  That's why they talk with lisping, calm, NPR voices to soothe you, like the snake in the jungle book who talks very sweetly and quietly and tries to hypnotize you while his eyes swirl.
[00:40:00.325 --> 00:40:06.490]  I remember when I first really woke up to this when I went to a Smart Growth Conference in 1997 in Austin.
[00:40:06.490 --> 00:40:09.253]  And I know Mike Hanson's got those videos from the old TV show.
[00:40:09.253 --> 00:40:12.956]  He's got to dig those out and get it up on his YouTube archive channel.
[00:40:12.956 --> 00:40:16.619]  Most of the really powerful stuff hadn't been uploaded yet, or I don't know if they can find it.
[00:40:16.619 --> 00:40:22.865]  But I go to that event, and it's thousands of city council people, mayors,
[00:40:24.462 --> 00:40:31.306]  from all over the country, banking heads, former Dallas Cowboys, you know, all these people.
[00:40:31.306 --> 00:40:36.069]  And they're up there on the podiums at the Austin Convention Center saying, this is a business.
[00:40:36.069 --> 00:40:37.510]  We're going to raise carbon taxes.
[00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:39.871]  We're going to take people's property.
[00:40:39.871 --> 00:40:45.455]  Only the insiders are going to have access to the property.
[00:40:46.255 --> 00:40:59.505]  And it's going to be awesome, and I would go to them, and even Michael Dell was there, I talked to him, there's an interview with Michael Dell of Dell Computer, and I said, this is a scam, this is a fraud, and they would all laugh at me and arrogantly say, you bet it is.
[00:41:00.601 --> 00:41:03.422]  And the Dallas Cowboy got in my face and shoved me out of the way.
[00:41:03.422 --> 00:41:10.624]  And it was just a group of hardcore, savage people that knew exactly what they were doing with Agenda 21.
[00:41:10.624 --> 00:41:16.746]  And it was a ship of hardcore pirates, high-fiving, laughing.
[00:41:16.746 --> 00:41:21.268]  It was not about bunnies and bees and flowers and the earth.
[00:41:21.268 --> 00:41:26.610]  It was, we're coming in, we've got control, we're taking over this nation.
[00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:32.204]  And they had the heads of three of the big six banks up there admitting.
[00:41:32.204 --> 00:41:41.633]  I mean, it was like that scene in They Live where they go underground and the aliens that are cloaked as humans are saying, welcome human power elite.
[00:41:41.633 --> 00:41:47.839]  In only one short decade, we've consolidated power and bankrupted most of the slaves and we're taking over.
[00:41:47.839 --> 00:41:50.181]  Good job, the human power elite.
[00:41:50.956 --> 00:41:56.218]  I mean, I was at this meeting, I got footage of them, and I was like, whoa!
[00:41:56.218 --> 00:41:58.378]  They know what they're doing!
[00:41:58.378 --> 00:42:04.920]  Well, of course they do when they go out to some 2,000 acre ranch, jack the taxes up, force them to sell for pennies on the dollar.
[00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:10.221]  Two years later, take the environmental regs off, build shopping malls on it.
[00:42:10.221 --> 00:42:15.643]  I mean, they got former mayors who own the banks that only the money can go through.
[00:42:15.643 --> 00:42:18.904]  I mean, it's just so hardcore.
[00:42:22.185 --> 00:42:25.188]  It's off the charts.
[00:42:25.188 --> 00:42:27.930]  And people better get wise to this.
[00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:30.652]  You think the government is wanting to fix the budget?
[00:42:30.652 --> 00:42:32.374]  They want you bankrupt.
[00:42:32.374 --> 00:42:34.175]  They made the money up out of nothing.
[00:42:34.175 --> 00:42:40.501]  For every dollar that's created, a dollar of debt is created to them.
[00:42:40.501 --> 00:42:45.385]  And so they're giving you slave training right now that they're gonna stick their hands down your pants.
[00:42:45.385 --> 00:42:46.526]  They're gonna tell you you can't
[00:42:48.015 --> 00:42:49.636]  Pack your child's lunch.
[00:42:49.636 --> 00:42:51.598]  They're going in all over the country.
[00:42:51.598 --> 00:42:55.341]  They've already done this in the public schools and even colleges.
[00:42:55.341 --> 00:43:04.749]  They're now going into the private schools, the private day camps that have been established for, in some cases, one of the, I was reading about in Upstate New York's over 100 years old, and they're saying it's over.
[00:43:04.749 --> 00:43:08.673]  No more, no more capture the flag, no more nothing.
[00:43:10.506 --> 00:43:11.966]  Because we care about you.
[00:43:11.966 --> 00:43:16.948]  That's why I've made a video that I've got to say is the most positive response we've ever seen to a video.
[00:43:16.948 --> 00:43:24.591]  A couple times a year I do a satire video, a joke video, illustrating absurdity by being absurd.
[00:43:24.591 --> 00:43:33.113]  And when you watch this 13-minute video up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, we'll put it up on screen, please.
[00:43:33.113 --> 00:43:38.335]  When you watch this video and it's titled,
[00:43:39.907 --> 00:43:45.512]  Censored video, Alex Jones joins the New World Order.
[00:43:45.512 --> 00:43:53.540]  That's the text in the headline, and again, we'll show you the news article in the video on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:43:53.540 --> 00:44:03.550]  I'm gonna have Watson tomorrow write an article explaining that this video looks hardcore, looks bizarre, as I yell at my employees in a mock satire video.
[00:44:04.893 --> 00:44:05.854]  I don't think so.
[00:44:19.784 --> 00:44:28.610]  So this video needs to go mega viral, and of course it is satire as we have the headline, censored video, Alex Jones joins the New World Order.
[00:44:28.610 --> 00:44:38.717]  We could give it the headline too, alternate, you know, the nanny state gone wild, but as crazy and off the wall as this seems, this is what they're doing.
[00:44:38.717 --> 00:44:44.682]  This is what the system is doing, trying to break our will and train us to accept all of this.
[00:44:44.682 --> 00:44:49.145]  So again, censored video, Alex Jones joins the New World Order.
[00:44:51.457 --> 00:44:54.624]  And I just came up with the idea last Friday.
[00:44:54.624 --> 00:44:57.410]  We shot it in about 45 minutes.
[00:44:57.410 --> 00:45:00.757]  They edited it on Monday and Tuesday, and we released it last night.
[00:45:01.912 --> 00:45:05.133]  And Rob Dew edited it, and Aaron Dyke shot video with him.
[00:45:05.133 --> 00:45:05.953]  They did a great job.
[00:45:05.953 --> 00:45:08.533]  So did the crew that wanted to take part in it.
[00:45:08.533 --> 00:45:09.514]  You don't see a lot of the crew.
[00:45:09.514 --> 00:45:13.334]  Some of the crew obviously don't want to be on camera, but anybody that wanted to be on camera here on our crew.
[00:45:13.334 --> 00:45:17.455]  So you also get a behind-the-scenes look at the office and the crew.
[00:45:17.455 --> 00:45:21.716]  But again, you can check out the video at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:45:21.716 --> 00:45:30.158]  And I need to get Watson or Kurt or Steve or one of our great writers to do a write-up on this so that people
[00:45:32.139 --> 00:45:32.600]  I don't know.
[00:45:49.155 --> 00:45:53.658]  That it's not a bunch of limp-wristed liberals that want to keep you safe.
[00:45:53.658 --> 00:45:58.261]  This is prisoner social engineering control in their own admissions.
[00:45:58.261 --> 00:46:05.646]  And I've got all the top globalists going back to the 1920s when they said we're going to domesticate people in the name of their own good.
[00:46:05.646 --> 00:46:11.250]  Forced inoculations, food and water will be poisoned with things that make people more passive.
[00:46:11.250 --> 00:46:13.131]  We'll break up the family in the name of safety.
[00:46:13.131 --> 00:46:16.814]  We'll end corporal punishment so kids will be badly behaved.
[00:46:16.814 --> 00:46:18.315]  Only the state will be allowed to meet out
[00:46:19.516 --> 00:46:21.177]  Justice, i.e.
[00:46:21.177 --> 00:46:22.819]  tasers and the rest of it.
[00:46:22.819 --> 00:46:30.386]  I mean it's all laid out and I want to really more and more go after this nanny state because it's now going into full gallop.
[00:46:31.345 --> 00:46:37.767]  Now, when we come back from break, cops use mobile scanner to steal cell phone data from innocent Americans.
[00:46:37.767 --> 00:46:40.667]  And this has been going on nationwide, not just in Michigan.
[00:46:40.667 --> 00:46:43.268]  And I want to break down what this really means after the break.
[00:46:43.268 --> 00:46:44.848]  It is such a big deal.
[00:46:44.848 --> 00:46:47.909]  We've got this attitude from all the cop shows, we'll just support what cops do.
[00:46:47.909 --> 00:46:50.870]  Well, does that mean support the illegal things they're told to do?
[00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:52.630]  This is illegal.
[00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:56.932]  But they're just setting the precedent to do it, just like it's illegal for TSA to stick their hands down your pants.
[00:46:56.932 --> 00:46:58.372]  I mean, it's illegal, federal and state law.
[00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:08.157]  I've had the DA's on, I've had the constitutional scholars on, I've had former congressmen on, current congressmen, lawyers like Bob Barr.
[00:47:08.157 --> 00:47:10.039]  It is illegal on its face.
[00:47:10.039 --> 00:47:11.960]  They don't care.
[00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:16.084]  It's illegal to not test the radiation being released every month at the airports.
[00:47:16.084 --> 00:47:17.926]  They don't test them, they don't care.
[00:47:17.926 --> 00:47:20.368]  They do what they want.
[00:47:20.368 --> 00:47:21.449]  That's what tyranny's all about.
[00:47:23.217 --> 00:47:25.558]  Most of what the Nazis did wasn't on the books in Germany.
[00:47:25.558 --> 00:47:26.679]  They just did it.
[00:47:26.679 --> 00:47:27.479]  All right.
[00:47:27.479 --> 00:47:34.803]  I wanted to briefly, just for three minutes, quickly, because Ted's got to go to a very exciting meeting about getting us on a big syndicated chain of radio stations.
[00:47:34.803 --> 00:47:36.324]  Wow, exciting stuff happening.
[00:47:36.324 --> 00:47:38.445]  Ted's got to leave here in just a few minutes.
[00:47:38.445 --> 00:47:41.927]  But just in the next three minutes, Ted, gold's still up above $1,500.
[00:47:41.927 --> 00:47:43.167]  Silver's surging.
[00:47:43.167 --> 00:47:45.529]  You bought gold and silver a few months ago when it was
[00:47:46.369 --> 00:47:48.952]  50, 60 bucks less, you're about to run out of that.
[00:47:48.952 --> 00:47:54.358]  You'll still keep running up, and the new stuff you buy will still be lower than where it goes in the future, the evidence shows.
[00:47:54.358 --> 00:48:00.805]  But I wanted to briefly have you on with an economic snapshot of what's happening, and also the out-of-this-world deals.
[00:48:00.805 --> 00:48:05.771]  And folks, I dare you to find silver at lower prices, gold at lower prices, in these radio specials.
[00:48:05.771 --> 00:48:06.512]  Ted, tell us what you got.
[00:48:07.011 --> 00:48:10.874]  Yeah, 1507 is where gold is, 4543 silver.
[00:48:10.874 --> 00:48:15.078]  It's up a dollar and a half since we were lost on air just yesterday.
[00:48:15.078 --> 00:48:19.322]  Right now, presently, I'm holding the price on those videos, $115.
[00:48:19.322 --> 00:48:22.665]  I will be marking them up higher tonight because I have to.
[00:48:22.665 --> 00:48:24.726]  So if you want to get on that silver dollar video deal,
[00:48:25.647 --> 00:48:26.107]  Get it.
[00:48:26.107 --> 00:48:30.469]  You already went up five bucks a week ago, now silver's run up so much more.
[00:48:30.469 --> 00:48:35.411]  Three silver dollars, over $120 value, and that's low in the market.
[00:48:35.411 --> 00:48:40.693]  Free shipping, three of my best-selling films, so that's about $70 to $5 or so off.
[00:48:40.693 --> 00:48:42.634]  I mean, you cannot beat the deal.
[00:48:42.634 --> 00:48:42.714]  800-686-2237.
[00:48:42.714 --> 00:48:43.134]  800-686-237.
[00:48:43.134 --> 00:48:45.415]  What about the creature from Jekyll Island?
[00:48:45.415 --> 00:48:47.316]  A silver dollar and that book, how much is that?
[00:48:52.438 --> 00:48:54.100]  Yeah, that's another one.
[00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:58.365]  $41 I deliver the Creature from Jekyll Island book and you get a silver dollar with it.
[00:48:58.365 --> 00:49:02.430]  And that might, you know, getting that book is just so important.
[00:49:02.430 --> 00:49:07.576]  So that's about a $65 value because the books, 20 plus bucks in stores, you're paying 13, 14 bucks for it.
[00:49:08.857 --> 00:49:11.499]  That's at cost on the silver dollar for you.
[00:49:11.499 --> 00:49:13.140]  So then the free book and the free shipping.
[00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:21.946]  It's a free book and free shipping when you get the silver dollar as a loss leader to introduce you to gold and silver and to introduce you to this information.
[00:49:21.946 --> 00:49:23.327]  Ask about the radio specials 800-686-2237.
[00:49:23.327 --> 00:49:24.828]  I only promote what I believe in.
[00:49:29.022 --> 00:49:31.345]  And I believe that food prices would go up.
[00:49:31.345 --> 00:49:31.786]  They have.
[00:49:31.786 --> 00:49:33.588]  I believe that oil prices would go up.
[00:49:33.588 --> 00:49:34.349]  They have.
[00:49:34.349 --> 00:49:36.652]  I believe gold and silver would go up.
[00:49:36.652 --> 00:49:37.894]  They have.
[00:49:37.894 --> 00:49:39.837]  Silver's up five, six times.
[00:49:39.837 --> 00:49:42.660]  Gold's more than four times what it was 11 years ago.
[00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:43.401]  Proof's in the pudding.
[00:49:43.982 --> 00:49:46.984]  The mainline news still tells you don't buy gold, only idiots buy it.
[00:49:46.984 --> 00:49:49.426]  And mostly yuppies follow orders, because they love to be trendy.
[00:49:49.426 --> 00:49:52.068]  800-686-2237.
[00:49:52.068 --> 00:49:55.190]  The globalists do not want you to get this gold and silver.
[00:49:55.190 --> 00:50:00.634]  Briefly, Ted, what are some of the other radio specials on Frank Sovereigns, buffaloes, maple leaves?
[00:50:00.634 --> 00:50:04.137]  Give us a list of what folks can ask for when they call to get the mega good deal.
[00:50:04.517 --> 00:50:06.458]  Yeah, well let me just run through them real quick.
[00:50:06.458 --> 00:50:07.798]  Eagles are at $1,600.
[00:50:07.798 --> 00:50:10.399]  Buffaloes are at $1,650.
[00:50:10.399 --> 00:50:11.260]  Really good buy.
[00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:12.580]  Franks right now $326.
[00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:16.082]  You get a full year subscription to the International Forecaster.
[00:50:16.082 --> 00:50:19.003]  British Sovereigns are at $405.
[00:50:19.003 --> 00:50:20.223]  Walking Liberty halves.
[00:50:20.223 --> 00:50:22.044]  Presently right now $2,061.
[00:50:22.044 --> 00:50:24.225]  They have to move up in price.
[00:50:24.225 --> 00:50:27.086]  Just about everything I have right now, I'm holding back.
[00:50:29.847 --> 00:50:31.488]  Bullion bars, gold right now.
[00:50:31.488 --> 00:50:32.289]  Great time to buy.
[00:50:32.289 --> 00:50:40.034]  By the way, there's only about 1.5 trillion dollars worth of gold bullion out there to buy, and there's 200 billion dollars in assets.
[00:50:40.034 --> 00:50:41.655]  What do you think's gonna happen?
[00:50:41.655 --> 00:50:46.018]  I mean, if any of that money moves over... Oh, the universities are rushing in and buying billions in gold.
[00:50:46.018 --> 00:50:47.019]  UT just bought a billion.
[00:50:47.019 --> 00:50:47.519]  800-686-2237.
[00:50:47.519 --> 00:50:47.719]  800-686-2237.
[00:50:47.719 --> 00:50:53.423]  We'll be right back to get into the 1984 behavior of the police nationwide hacking your cell phones illegally.
[00:51:03.490 --> 00:51:05.812]  Alex Jones here with key information.
[00:51:05.812 --> 00:51:06.392]  The U.S.
[00:51:06.392 --> 00:51:13.678]  government is a Ponzi scheme that relies on the Treasury continuously selling large amounts of government bonds to foreign central banks.
[00:51:13.678 --> 00:51:16.380]  With Japan about to become a seller of U.S.
[00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:19.722]  bonds in order to rebuild its own nation, and the U.S.
[00:51:19.722 --> 00:51:26.367]  antagonizing China by calling them currency manipulators, the Federal Reserve, which is already buying about 70% of U.S.
[00:51:26.367 --> 00:51:29.030]  Treasuries, will soon be the only buyer left of U.S.
[00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:29.470]  Treasuries.
[00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:33.372]  Our friends at the National Inflation Association believe that the U.S.
[00:51:33.372 --> 00:51:39.315]  dollar will soon become worthless and Americans will see the purchasing power of their incomes and savings destroyed.

[00:53:44.265 --> 00:53:47.506]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:53:47.506 --> 00:53:49.266]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:54:05.202 --> 00:54:13.063]  You know that the Supreme Court is hearing the case of the FBI putting
[00:54:14.130 --> 00:54:18.894]  GPS tracker boxes on the bottoms of people's cars.
[00:54:18.894 --> 00:54:20.875]  The media's like, oh, they've got to stop them.
[00:54:20.875 --> 00:54:22.617]  They might be cocaine dealers.
[00:54:22.617 --> 00:54:24.438]  We don't need warrants to do this to you.
[00:54:24.438 --> 00:54:28.021]  Meanwhile, the big mega banks on record launder almost all the drug money.
[00:54:28.021 --> 00:54:32.004]  The CIA is constantly being caught in Miami and other states.
[00:54:32.004 --> 00:54:35.286]  Esquire's written articles about police pull up to do a drug bust.
[00:54:35.286 --> 00:54:37.988]  It's a jet full of cocaine, heroin, you name it.
[00:54:37.988 --> 00:54:43.653]  And they just flash CIA badges and then are ordered by the state police who are under their control and the FBI to release them.
[00:54:44.485 --> 00:54:47.428]  And they've caught 18 wheelers in Texas full of three tons of cocaine.
[00:54:47.428 --> 00:54:48.590]  They're ordered to release them.
[00:54:48.590 --> 00:54:50.292]  My point is, it's all a stinkin' fraud.
[00:54:50.292 --> 00:54:51.273]  Let's just be honest about it.
[00:54:51.949 --> 00:55:01.374]  Okay, now that said, all over the country, and I told you about this years ago, because it's in the specs of the cell phones, and this stuff has leaked out.
[00:55:01.374 --> 00:55:18.324]  First place I saw it was 2003 in the Green Bay paper with the governor at a federal threat fusion center showing how they could type in your name with your social security number or driver's license and then instantly pull up where you were real time via your cell phone off of GPS triangulation.
[00:55:18.624 --> 00:55:22.405]  The cell phone doesn't have GPS, the cell tower's triangulated, they have GPS.
[00:55:22.405 --> 00:55:33.489]  Now, continuing with this information, Paul Joseph Watson has the article on it, Cops Use Mobile Scanner To Steal Cell Phone Data From Innocent Americans.
[00:55:33.489 --> 00:55:41.492]  And this is also at CBS News, CNET News, ACLU, Michigan Cops Stealing Driver's Phone Data.
[00:55:41.492 --> 00:55:46.374]  And when they pull you over, they have wireless systems, they also have a system where they can plug it in,
[00:55:47.646 --> 00:55:53.793]  And this is the whole excuse nationwide is to see if you've been texting.
[00:55:53.793 --> 00:55:57.797]  Just like they have federal grants to make them take blood from you at checkpoints now.
[00:55:57.797 --> 00:56:01.381]  It's all about them getting into your body, getting into your laptops.
[00:56:01.381 --> 00:56:07.768]  The Homeland Security, TSA, is now taking for years laptops and cell phones and downloading the data.
[00:56:08.755 --> 00:56:10.136]  No judge, no jury.
[00:56:10.136 --> 00:56:15.039]  They're gonna radiate you, they're gonna put their hands down your pants, your children's pants, and they're gonna steal your data.
[00:56:15.039 --> 00:56:30.089]  Well, now the police are being trained to do this, but they also have wireless systems that grab it, and that's what Google got caught in Europe doing, and now they announced, what, two months ago, that, oh, the government's gonna provide wireless internet to the public over the fleet of
[00:56:31.650 --> 00:56:33.231]  Postal service vehicles.
[00:56:33.231 --> 00:56:36.393]  And oh yeah, they'll also monitor things with it.
[00:56:36.393 --> 00:56:40.155]  And they'll have the same mast on them like Google, stealing your data.
[00:56:40.155 --> 00:56:49.340]  And it goes on, the Michigan State Police have started using handheld machines called extraction devices to download personal information from motorists they pull over, even if they're not suspected of any crime.
[00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:53.563]  Now imagine, in America, I'm pulling you over for speeding, give me your cell phone, I'm plugging it in.
[00:56:53.563 --> 00:57:00.687]  And then they download what's on it with no warrant, and it immediately cracks the code, gets passcodes, photos, phone list,
[00:57:02.356 --> 00:57:12.222]  And when the ACLU did a FOIA request to get this, they slammed them back with a $500,000 plus bill, claiming that's how much it cost to give them the data.
[00:57:12.222 --> 00:57:13.763]  So just incredible.
[00:57:13.763 --> 00:57:16.685]  Michigan police search cell phones during traffic stops.
[00:57:16.685 --> 00:57:22.008]  ACL seeks information on Michigan program that allows cops to download information from smartphones.
[00:57:22.008 --> 00:57:23.889]  This came out last year in England.
[00:57:23.889 --> 00:57:28.412]  In London, they're testing it where they have systems that break in while you're walking around and grab it.
[00:57:29.756 --> 00:57:30.997]  Here's another one, London Guardian.
[00:57:30.997 --> 00:57:35.460]  iPhone keeps record of everywhere you go, privacy fears raised.
[00:57:35.460 --> 00:57:41.024]  As researchers reveal, file on iPhone that stores location coordinates and timestamps of owner's movements.
[00:57:41.024 --> 00:57:43.245]  And this was all under the Telecommunications Act of 96.
[00:57:43.245 --> 00:57:46.728]  Now, the point is, this is illegal.
[00:57:47.895 --> 00:57:49.776]  But they don't care.
[00:57:49.776 --> 00:57:56.239]  They're gonna pull you over, they're gonna demand your phone, they're gonna grab it and plug it in, and within seconds download everything off of it.
[00:57:56.239 --> 00:58:03.122]  It's gotta... because the phones are designed, all the smartphones, under law, to give them everything.
[00:58:03.122 --> 00:58:05.283]  And by the way, you may think you got a cheap phone that's just a flip phone.
[00:58:05.283 --> 00:58:06.984]  Those are smartphones too.
[00:58:06.984 --> 00:58:12.407]  Under the Telecommunications Act of 96, by October 1st, 2001, all phones had to be compliant.
[00:58:12.407 --> 00:58:12.527]  Now,
[00:58:14.022 --> 00:58:18.905]  They've got these systems being retrofitted on the government vehicles to drive around stealing everything.
[00:58:18.905 --> 00:58:22.167]  They use Google as the NSA front.
[00:58:22.167 --> 00:58:28.530]  Now, if you did this as a private citizen, it's called cell phone hacking, and it's got long prison sentences.
[00:58:28.530 --> 00:58:30.251]  But they just do it.
[00:58:30.251 --> 00:58:38.636]  No Fourth Amendment, no Fifth Amendment, but meanwhile they've confirmed the Border Patrol's been ordered to stand down and not arrest illegals running around murdering and killing.
[00:58:44.620 --> 00:58:50.803]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:50.803 --> 00:58:51.964]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:58:51.964 --> 00:58:58.887]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:58:58.887 --> 00:59:01.448]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:59:01.448 --> 00:59:06.831]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:59:06.831 --> 00:59:09.872]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:59:09.872 --> 00:59:11.933]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:59:12.173 --> 00:59:18.437]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:59:18.437 --> 00:59:21.819]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:59:21.819 --> 00:59:27.603]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:59:27.603 --> 00:59:29.244]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:59:29.244 --> 00:59:30.545]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:59:30.545 --> 00:59:33.207]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:59:33.207 --> 00:59:37.429]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:59:37.429 --> 00:59:40.031]  You can find the video at www dot

[00:59:42.052 --> 00:59:44.632]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[00:59:53.715 --> 00:59:56.116]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.116 --> 00:59:58.897]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.509 --> 01:00:10.333]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.333 --> 01:00:11.935]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.935 --> 01:00:13.476]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.476 --> 01:00:17.680]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:21.764]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:31.573 --> 01:00:33.474]  We are back live into hour number two.
[01:00:33.474 --> 01:00:49.745]  Dr. Tarpley, the brain bug, will be joining us coming up here in just a few minutes with his incredible expertise breaking down what's happening in Libya and the peaceful ground war, the peaceful air bombardment as we enter 1984.
[01:00:49.745 --> 01:00:57.810]  I'm going to cover this more coming up in the third hour today because it's so important and I want to take your calls on it.
[01:00:57.810 --> 01:00:58.510]  But finishing up,
[01:00:59.741 --> 01:00:59.941]  This is
[01:01:17.421 --> 01:01:19.622]  Cops steal cell phone.
[01:01:19.622 --> 01:01:23.663]  Yeah, let's make that the number one search term today so they go to Infowars.com and then read about this.
[01:01:23.663 --> 01:01:26.064]  Cops steal cell phone.
[01:01:26.064 --> 01:01:28.044]  Cops steal cell phone.
[01:01:28.044 --> 01:01:29.765]  Cops steal cell phone.
[01:01:29.765 --> 01:01:32.085]  Three words, let's hit them, let's hit them hard.
[01:01:32.085 --> 01:01:39.387]  C-O-P-S steal, S-T-E-A-L, cell phone.
[01:01:39.387 --> 01:01:40.988]  Cops steal cell phone.
[01:01:42.173 --> 01:01:43.274]  And it's so incredible.
[01:01:43.274 --> 01:01:44.595]  I mean, incredible isn't the word.
[01:01:44.595 --> 01:01:47.318]  There is not words that I've known for a long time.
[01:01:47.318 --> 01:01:51.222]  They've got wireless hubs, including my sources in the Austin Police Department.
[01:01:51.222 --> 01:01:54.425]  They've got through the local Federal Threat Fusion Center.
[01:01:54.425 --> 01:01:56.447]  This has actually been in the paper, this part.
[01:01:56.447 --> 01:02:04.134]  Hundreds and hundreds of microphones all over the city that are shotgun mics, listening to your street conversations with keyword analysis that then flags it.
[01:02:05.401 --> 01:02:08.763]  They record for a week or so and then dump the data, we're told.
[01:02:08.763 --> 01:02:11.764]  And that started going in in 98 under a federal grant.
[01:02:11.764 --> 01:02:12.765]  It's all over the country.
[01:02:12.765 --> 01:02:16.867]  I remember a story about the Forest Service putting it up in the middle of nowhere.
[01:02:16.867 --> 01:02:21.850]  They've got laser couplers that they drive around on these big trucks, aim them at your windows.
[01:02:21.850 --> 01:02:23.190]  You can't even see the laser.
[01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:29.514]  And then it picks up the audio bouncing off the window like a eardrum membrane.
[01:02:30.902 --> 01:02:37.463]  They also have these cell phone grabbers, and they can also just dial right into your cell phone conversations.
[01:02:37.463 --> 01:02:38.423]  No warrants.
[01:02:38.423 --> 01:02:40.784]  And the cops feel special being part of the special units.
[01:02:40.784 --> 01:02:42.444]  They get a lot more money.
[01:02:42.444 --> 01:02:46.285]  And last time I checked, what, Austin has six or seven of these big trucks.
[01:02:46.285 --> 01:02:49.165]  They've got some of them disguised, some of them not.
[01:02:49.165 --> 01:02:52.706]  And they've got the big Federal Command Center with all these toys.
[01:02:52.706 --> 01:02:54.226]  And they've got license plate readers up.
[01:02:54.226 --> 01:02:55.366]  This is where I live.
[01:02:55.366 --> 01:02:58.347]  Face scanners up.
[01:02:58.347 --> 01:03:00.027]  And it's all very orderly.
[01:03:01.121 --> 01:03:05.242]  The narcotics are shipped in, it's all very fun, and they hope they find you using them.
[01:03:05.242 --> 01:03:11.125]  And even if they don't catch you using them in places like Dallas and Houston, they admit they just frame everybody in masks, it's all come out in the news.
[01:03:11.125 --> 01:03:18.247]  Dallas police just pull you over, throw a bag of chalk in your car, take your luxury vehicle, or they go to your house, throw it and take it, and it's all admitted, nobody gets in trouble.
[01:03:18.247 --> 01:03:20.128]  The same thing in Seattle, it's come out.
[01:03:20.128 --> 01:03:24.449]  Cops go in and sell to another cop drugs in the bathroom, then take your bar or restaurant.
[01:03:24.449 --> 01:03:28.671]  And then it's turned out in many areas of Seattle, more than half the bars are owned by cops.
[01:03:30.783 --> 01:03:35.887]  Oh, it's so good to have a public just ready to be total slaves.
[01:03:35.887 --> 01:03:37.368]  They love it.
[01:03:37.368 --> 01:03:45.714]  And then the good cops, well, they stay even when they're 55 years old as beat cops writing tickets and going to domestic disturbances.
[01:03:45.714 --> 01:03:54.201]  But all the cops that know how to play ball, man, I've seen Austin cops that beat up people in wheelchairs in cases we've covered, and then they get promoted right to commander.
[01:03:54.201 --> 01:03:56.483]  I mean, it's over.
[01:03:56.483 --> 01:03:57.884]  I mean, it's over.
[01:03:57.884 --> 01:03:58.344]  It's over.
[01:04:00.236 --> 01:04:10.279]  And the SWAT team guys can flip cars and wreck and nothing happens when they're drunk and other cops can run off the road drunk on their motorcycles and kill themselves and they go arrest the bar owner.
[01:04:10.279 --> 01:04:12.639]  Just where I live, it's so much fun.
[01:04:12.639 --> 01:04:15.560]  But again, it's impossible for police to ever go bad.
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:18.041]  It never happened in any other country.
[01:04:18.041 --> 01:04:19.801]  Well, it's happened here.
[01:04:19.801 --> 01:04:21.162]  And the system is corrupt.
[01:04:21.162 --> 01:04:22.602]  The system is evil.
[01:04:22.602 --> 01:04:25.063]  We got the documents two years ago from law enforcement who were good.
[01:04:26.127 --> 01:04:34.575]  True peace officers that, hey, the number one target is returning veterans, gun owners, conservatives, libertarians.
[01:04:34.575 --> 01:04:37.898]  So you see the old gray-haired cops out there with their radar guns all day.
[01:04:37.898 --> 01:04:42.983]  You see the young, crazy-eyed, gremlin-looking, shaved-head cops with the devil tattoos.
[01:04:42.983 --> 01:04:45.546]  They're commanders.
[01:04:45.546 --> 01:04:48.168]  Oh, Dim, it's you from Clockwork Orange.
[01:04:48.168 --> 01:04:48.488]  And he goes,
[01:04:49.497 --> 01:04:52.280]  It's Officer Demowski to you!
[01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:53.542]  No more dim!
[01:04:53.542 --> 01:04:54.983]  I got power now!
[01:04:54.983 --> 01:04:55.944]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:02.622 --> 01:05:06.583]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:06.583 --> 01:05:15.445]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:05:15.445 --> 01:05:20.066]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:05:20.066 --> 01:05:30.888]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:05:31.528 --> 01:05:41.037]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:41.037 --> 01:05:46.482]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:05:46.482 --> 01:05:53.968]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:53.968 --> 01:05:56.731]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:06:01.883 --> 01:06:05.884]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:06:05.884 --> 01:06:09.125]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:06:09.125 --> 01:06:13.926]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:06:13.926 --> 01:06:20.308]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:06:20.308 --> 01:06:22.549]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:06:23.089 --> 01:06:23.409]  Tim Geithner?
[01:06:23.409 --> 01:06:23.889]  Bernanke?
[01:06:23.889 --> 01:06:24.270]  They're arsonists!
[01:06:24.270 --> 01:06:25.030]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:06:25.030 --> 01:06:26.671]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:06:41.997 --> 01:06:49.279]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:06:49.279 --> 01:06:58.382]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:07:00.407 --> 01:07:04.950]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:07:04.950 --> 01:07:05.850]  Number 1.
[01:07:05.850 --> 01:07:09.293]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:09.293 --> 01:07:10.153]  Number 2.
[01:07:10.153 --> 01:07:15.036]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:07:15.036 --> 01:07:15.777]  It's true.
[01:07:15.777 --> 01:07:20.660]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:21.480]  Number 3.
[01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:25.063]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:07:25.063 --> 01:07:28.765]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:07:28.965 --> 01:07:29.766]  Number 4.
[01:07:29.766 --> 01:07:32.528]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:07:32.528 --> 01:07:36.211]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:07:36.211 --> 01:07:36.991]  Number 5.
[01:07:36.991 --> 01:07:41.154]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:07:41.154 --> 01:07:45.898]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:07:46.198 --> 01:07:50.361]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:50.361 --> 01:07:52.143]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:52.143 --> 01:07:54.384]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:07:54.384 --> 01:08:02.310]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:08:02.310 --> 01:08:08.935]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.935 --> 01:08:11.918]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:20.919 --> 01:08:33.727]  By the way, Dr. Jerome Corsi's got a book coming out on Obama, and he's gone all over the world, Indonesia, Kenya, you name it, and they've expunged the records.
[01:08:33.727 --> 01:08:38.670]  The one school record we got does confirm he changed his name to Barry Sotero, did give up his U.S.
[01:08:38.670 --> 01:08:39.771]  citizenship.
[01:08:39.771 --> 01:08:42.893]  Well, that's all over the news today, but I just want to point out that
[01:08:43.573 --> 01:08:54.683]  Webster Tarpley, and we carry both of his books by the way, reported this years ago and in total detail, the full spectrum with Barack H. Obama, the unauthorized biography.
[01:08:54.683 --> 01:09:00.168]  And it is the preeminent work available at InfoWars.com and deserves to be seen by everyone.
[01:09:00.168 --> 01:09:09.877]  It is, of course, a big report at Drudge Report today, book to reveal Obama's true identity, and I'm sure it's going to be powerful, by Jerome Corsi, and it goes through the fact that
[01:09:10.618 --> 01:09:17.281]  All over the world, they're hiding who he really is, and that they've found some groundbreaking information.
[01:09:17.281 --> 01:09:24.644]  And remember, this is the guy that basically swift-boated Kerry, so they do dig out some pretty powerful information.
[01:09:24.644 --> 01:09:35.068]  But in the case of what's going on with Barry Sotero, aka Barack Obama, there is no doubt
[01:09:36.027 --> 01:09:38.029]  No doubt he's CIA.
[01:09:38.029 --> 01:09:45.054]  And that's the issue that's getting the death threats from very credible sources delivered to Wayne Madsen.
[01:09:45.054 --> 01:09:47.917]  So I also want to briefly talk about that with Webster Griffin Tarpley.
[01:09:47.917 --> 01:09:48.697]  But here's the headline.
[01:09:48.697 --> 01:09:50.318]  Missing records in Hawaii.
[01:09:50.318 --> 01:09:52.080]  Missing records in Kenya.
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:53.261]  Missing records in Indonesia.
[01:09:53.261 --> 01:09:58.525]  And I want to post Drudge's article with a link to Drudge at Infowars.com, a part of his article.
[01:09:58.525 --> 01:09:59.866]  Did we do that yet?
[01:09:59.866 --> 01:10:03.829]  I want to make sure one of the web people gets that done right now.
[01:10:03.829 --> 01:10:04.310]  You did do it?
[01:10:05.464 --> 01:10:06.405]  Okay, awesome.
[01:10:06.405 --> 01:10:08.506]  It's up there at InfoWars.com.
[01:10:08.506 --> 01:10:10.788]  Lord Monckton's coming up in about 30 minutes.
[01:10:10.788 --> 01:10:15.031]  Steve Watts is coming up at the end of the third hour.
[01:10:15.031 --> 01:10:20.296]  But going to Webster Griffin Tarpley, it was Tarpley several months ago when the Libyan rebellion began that
[01:10:20.996 --> 01:10:22.637]  wrote the articles at Tarpley.net.
[01:10:22.637 --> 01:10:29.680]  We posted them at Infowars.com that broke down how the State Department was publicly funding these Al-Qaeda groups.
[01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:34.662]  Even the LA Times two days ago admitted NATO, Al-Qaeda, Taliban behind uprising.
[01:10:34.662 --> 01:10:40.064]  They're now Orwellian terms saying it's peaceful bombs they're dropping, it's humanitarian.
[01:10:40.064 --> 01:10:48.288]  They're actually saying the ground troops are going to be humanitarian force with weapons who are going to go out and enter the cities Qaddafi's in and if he fights back,
[01:10:48.848 --> 01:10:50.749]  Then they're going to have to bring in a larger ground force.
[01:10:50.749 --> 01:11:05.893]  So we've actually entered 1984 and there's a lot of mainstream news articles now admitting that the full ground invasion is on with the UN ordering the United States to contribute troops, the Marine Corps ships that are already there, more getting into place.
[01:11:05.893 --> 01:11:07.754]  So Webster Tarpley, a huge development.
[01:11:07.754 --> 01:11:10.735]  Over a month ago you said the Saudis are being double-crossed.
[01:11:11.315 --> 01:11:13.236]  The globalists are devaluing the dollar.
[01:11:13.236 --> 01:11:15.677]  This is a system to overthrow the entire Middle East.
[01:11:15.677 --> 01:11:21.679]  Now the Saudis, as you said months ago, you said this last year, are running to the Russians, running to the Chinese.
[01:11:21.679 --> 01:11:27.120]  I mean, it's incredible, Dr. Tarpley of History and also an economist, that you broke all this down.
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:29.581]  Now it's all evident there.
[01:11:29.581 --> 01:11:30.922]  What does this signify?
[01:11:30.922 --> 01:11:37.444]  And there's also some mainstream articles today that the Arab Spring is not going completely well for the globalists.
[01:11:38.325 --> 01:11:39.465]  Precisely.
[01:11:39.465 --> 01:11:56.412]  The basic idea is that you had all of these countries, be it Libya, be it Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and others, lots and lots of countries in the empire, that were trying to get out from under this suffocating US-British IMF domination.
[01:11:56.412 --> 01:12:03.495]  And in order to do that, they were playing the Russian card, the China card, the Iranian card, or trying to build themselves up.
[01:12:03.495 --> 01:12:04.215]  The BRICS card!
[01:12:05.576 --> 01:12:09.199]  Bricks is not quite going to do it, because it's a little bit heterogeneous.
[01:12:09.199 --> 01:12:10.700]  But yes, something like that.
[01:12:10.700 --> 01:12:16.765]  Individually, the bricks, although the bricks as an entity is not really coherent.
[01:12:16.765 --> 01:12:19.227]  But specifically now, the news is this.
[01:12:19.227 --> 01:12:22.609]  Saudi Arabia, of course, is a huge target of this.
[01:12:22.609 --> 01:12:26.813]  Ultimately, you might say Saudi Arabia is the main target after Egypt.
[01:12:27.133 --> 01:12:30.936]  They had to get Egypt out of the way to go into Libya to bring the weapons in.
[01:12:30.936 --> 01:12:33.538]  You said months ago Mubarak wasn't playing ball on that.
[01:12:33.538 --> 01:12:35.700]  Then Saudi Arabia, then Iran.
[01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:37.041]  It's the whole deal.
[01:12:37.041 --> 01:12:37.281]  Right.
[01:12:37.281 --> 01:12:39.002]  Now, here's what we've got.
[01:12:39.002 --> 01:12:51.892]  It's an attempt by the Saudis to defend themselves, to maintain their national independence and to stop this tremendous CIA intervention and National Endowment for Democracy intervention into their internal affairs.
[01:12:51.892 --> 01:12:52.572]  At the end of March,
[01:12:53.473 --> 01:13:10.422]  We have Prince Bandar, the head of the National Security Council, and as far as I can see, the dominant personality of the whole regime, of the royal family, going to Pakistan and meeting with the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Gilani, but I'm sure also with the Pakistani army.
[01:13:10.902 --> 01:13:11.022]  Yes.
[01:13:27.438 --> 01:13:30.339]  The Prince Bandar has arranged that if the U.S.
[01:13:30.339 --> 01:13:39.301]  starts a color revolution inside the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Pakistanis will send a division or more of troops to put it down.
[01:13:39.301 --> 01:13:45.863]  There is a tradition for this in the 1970s, 1980s at various times, the Saudis kept a division
[01:13:46.583 --> 01:13:47.785]  We're good to go.
[01:14:05.106 --> 01:14:14.493]  But you can see the idea that Bandar is turning to an alliance with Pakistan in order to defend Saudi Arabia against the U.S.
[01:14:14.493 --> 01:14:16.675]  is a kind of strategic revolution.
[01:14:16.675 --> 01:14:27.623]  Up to now, Saudi Arabia has relied on the United States for security, but now the people around Bandar see, obviously, that Obama is the main threat, that the U.S.
[01:14:27.623 --> 01:14:28.344]  regime, the CIA,
[01:14:28.524 --> 01:14:35.045]  The CIA, the NED, are the main threat to the internal security of Saudi Arabia, so they're looking for an option.
[01:14:35.045 --> 01:14:39.586]  Now once you say Pakistan, of course, you're also saying nuclear weapons.
[01:14:39.586 --> 01:14:49.008]  You can say in a certain way, it's quite possible that Bandar has arranged that Saudi Arabia is now under the Pakistani nuclear umbrella.
[01:14:49.008 --> 01:14:52.269]  This is quite a new thing in world affairs.
[01:14:52.269 --> 01:14:56.130]  These are two countries, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, who have been under the U.S.
[01:14:56.130 --> 01:14:56.390]  yoke
[01:14:56.830 --> 01:15:02.333]  Totally dominated by the US, bombed in the case of Pakistan, who are trying to make a jailbreak.
[01:15:02.333 --> 01:15:16.580]  And because of globalist treachery, they were fully under the Anglo-American system, but because of the attempted overthrows and assassinations of Benazir Bhutto and others, and I've had the former head of Pakistani intelligence on confirming this, Hamid Gul, folks, doesn't get any more...
[01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:17.300]  I don't
[01:15:32.999 --> 01:15:49.258]  Our oil company connections through Lindsey Williams and so the globalists were attempting through the Rand Corporation Brzezinski model for a global destabilization from North Africa, Middle East into Central Asia as a pretext to move giant forces in to then menace China and Russia.
[01:15:49.258 --> 01:15:51.040]  I mean this is an incredibly bold move.
[01:15:52.230 --> 01:15:59.575]  Actually, the first attempt of Bandar, the first thing that we didn't, but at least I learned about, was in July of 2009.
[01:15:59.575 --> 01:16:04.958]  I was on your program to call attention to the fact that Bandar was playing the Russian card.
[01:16:04.958 --> 01:16:07.279]  He had made numerous visits to Russia.
[01:16:07.279 --> 01:16:08.660]  He had been meeting with Putin.
[01:16:08.660 --> 01:16:13.363]  They were talking about Russian military assistance also there for Saudi Arabia.
[01:16:14.484 --> 01:16:19.647]  So that goes back almost two years, and in reality more, most likely.
[01:16:19.647 --> 01:16:26.891]  Since then, there was a period of about a year when Bondar disappeared from view, and we weren't exactly sure what had happened to him.
[01:16:26.891 --> 01:16:30.794]  But now the word in various publications is, Bondar is back.
[01:16:30.794 --> 01:16:41.221]  And I have to remind people, you may still have the idea that Bondar is this guy who's basically a slave of George Bush the Younger, Bondar Bush, close friend of the Bush family.
[01:16:41.221 --> 01:16:43.302]  This is ultimately all irrelevant.
[01:16:43.582 --> 01:16:51.606]  He's a survivor, and now it's even in Reuters that the Saudis are saying they're being double-crossed, so he leaves house arrest, he's now back.
[01:16:51.606 --> 01:16:55.808]  Right, and the house arrest, we have to see whether that was really house arrest or not.
[01:16:55.808 --> 01:16:59.009]  But the idea now is that if the U.S.
[01:16:59.009 --> 01:17:03.191]  starts this color revolution, that there will be Pakistani assistance.
[01:17:03.191 --> 01:17:04.452]  Look at how the U.S.
[01:17:04.452 --> 01:17:05.713]  is attacking Saudi Arabia.
[01:17:07.934 --> 01:17:11.535]  That entire thing in Yemen is basically a sideshow.
[01:17:11.535 --> 01:17:15.477]  The target of everything that happens in Yemen is Saudi Arabia.
[01:17:15.477 --> 01:17:28.423]  If you have the split-up of Yemen, above all, the emergence of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, AQAP, led by Shiri, a Guantanamo six-year alumnus brought in by the United States.
[01:17:28.863 --> 01:17:29.143]  And now
[01:17:48.971 --> 01:17:51.733]  That's even admitted in the LA Times and Washington Post.
[01:17:51.733 --> 01:17:54.234]  They're not even denying this.
[01:17:54.234 --> 01:17:56.076]  Brazenly, they think we're so done.
[01:17:56.076 --> 01:18:03.801]  They say bombs are humanitarian, ground troops are humanitarian, Al-Qaeda is bad when we say, good when we say, simultaneously.
[01:18:03.801 --> 01:18:07.163]  I mean, do you think they can really sell this to people?
[01:18:07.714 --> 01:18:09.594]  Well, they're trying hard.
[01:18:09.594 --> 01:18:12.315]  I just wanted to mention the other angle is Bahrain.
[01:18:12.315 --> 01:18:14.116]  Now, Bahrain is this island, right?
[01:18:14.116 --> 01:18:23.578]  It's one of these little emirates along what amounts to the coast of Saudi Arabia, the Gulf Coast, the Persian Gulf, Arabian Gulf coast of Saudi Arabia.
[01:18:23.578 --> 01:18:31.540]  Now, there we have the Saudi troops have intervened in support of the Sunni royal family against the Shiite
[01:18:32.261 --> 01:18:40.630]  This is obviously intended not just, it's not really a destabilization of Bahrain because the 5th Fleet base is there.
[01:18:40.630 --> 01:18:46.597]  There is an angle of putting pressure on the Royal Family because they don't want the base to be used for a war with Iran.
[01:18:46.817 --> 01:18:47.938]  Webster, I want to be clear.
[01:18:47.938 --> 01:18:48.978]  It's a soft underbelly.
[01:18:48.978 --> 01:18:50.039]  I want to be clear.
[01:18:50.039 --> 01:18:51.719]  And it's spread the contagion to Saudi Arabia.
[01:18:51.719 --> 01:18:55.561]  I can't stand the corrupt Saudis put in by British Intel 100 plus years ago.
[01:18:55.561 --> 01:18:57.402]  I can't stand Gaddafi.
[01:18:57.402 --> 01:19:01.684]  The point is, why are the globalists moving against their allies, their old enemies?
[01:19:01.684 --> 01:19:05.406]  They now admit, it's all over the news, that they are destabilizing.
[01:19:05.406 --> 01:19:09.067]  And the Saudis respond by saying, we're going to slash oil production.
[01:19:09.067 --> 01:19:09.828]  And yes, we're
[01:19:10.549 --> 01:19:20.171]  Two days after they met with Gates and tried to make a deal, the Secretary of Defense, they did run to Russia and China, and so this could be a big miscalculation by the Anglo-American globalist.
[01:19:21.158 --> 01:19:22.819]  I could.
[01:19:22.819 --> 01:19:28.343]  The idea, I think, is that these countries are targeted not because of their internal regimes.
[01:19:28.343 --> 01:19:33.487]  And of course, the Saudi internal regime is quite distasteful, to put it mildly.
[01:19:33.487 --> 01:19:39.251]  But the main issue is that they're attempting to rebel against Anglo-American domination.
[01:19:39.251 --> 01:19:41.993]  I think globalism is not exactly the right term.
[01:19:43.154 --> 01:19:44.816]  British imperialism.
[01:19:44.816 --> 01:19:46.278]  That's all it ever was.
[01:19:46.278 --> 01:19:51.584]  Globalism implies that there's a place at the table for Russia or China and so forth, and there's not.
[01:19:51.584 --> 01:19:52.985]  Those countries are all targeted.
[01:19:52.985 --> 01:19:56.709]  They're all ultimately on the receiving end of color revolutions.
[01:20:01.835 --> 01:20:22.556]  Fighting going on here, but I really respect your foresight your understanding, but it's admitted now again We read three mainstream news articles yesterday La Times you name it admitting that okay the West did orchestrate this in Egypt in Libya in Syria the State Department admits I mean they're doing all of this or
[01:20:23.377 --> 01:20:35.841]  And then I get Lennon LaRouge on for the first time ever, and I think he's got a lot of interesting ideas, and was right about the Anglo-American system, and almost 90 years old, and a very distinguished person.
[01:20:35.841 --> 01:20:44.524]  But when I brought it up to him that this was all a Western destabilization program, at the time it was admitted it was, he basically said it was a real revolution.
[01:20:44.524 --> 01:20:49.826]  Now I understand that people have real reasons to be upset, and the globalists recognize that climate.
[01:20:50.126 --> 01:20:56.506]  Politically, and then triggered it, but it's not debatable that they've triggered it, and off air you were mentioning that to me.
[01:20:56.506 --> 01:20:57.529]  Do you have any statements about it?
[01:20:58.522 --> 01:20:59.283]  Certainly.
[01:20:59.283 --> 01:21:06.767]  The thing that LaRouche was saying was that this was all genuine and spontaneous, and I think that is absolutely wrong.
[01:21:06.767 --> 01:21:09.089]  The grievances are real.
[01:21:09.089 --> 01:21:16.914]  The potential was real, just as the potential under Metternich in Europe in 1848 was real.
[01:21:16.914 --> 01:21:22.278]  But the detonation, and then the shaping, the leadership, the program,
[01:21:23.118 --> 01:21:29.880]  And the general direction of these things is totally provided by the CIA, MI6, and NED.
[01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:32.401]  I found it was interesting when you asked LaRouche that.
[01:21:32.401 --> 01:21:33.902]  He immediately dodged the question.
[01:21:33.902 --> 01:21:37.683]  He said, the only thing I can say about it is it's all totally spontaneous.
[01:21:38.483 --> 01:21:41.926]  And in 1782, the King of France made a mistake.
[01:21:41.926 --> 01:21:54.255]  Now, the 1782 King of France made the mistake actually leads to an argument that the French Revolution was actually a destabilization of France provoked and promoted by the
[01:21:54.635 --> 01:21:55.016]  The British.
[01:22:16.238 --> 01:22:42.268]  uh... you know was never an issue that's just a a a a a modern fiction but the british were in there openly manipulating the south and then stationing troops in canada threatening to invade that's all mainline history this is the grand stratagem great game right and i i was actually talking about about the french revolution not not so much the american civil war but it did i know i know but i i i i mentioned the french and then i shifted gears into the uh... yeah
[01:22:42.745 --> 01:22:54.831]  Yes, and of course, the Confederate States of America was a project that was detonated and promoted by Lord Palmerston, Lord John Russell, British Intelligence, and so forth.
[01:22:54.831 --> 01:23:03.955]  The other thing I think is interesting, looking at Bandar in particular, we have this interesting article by Martin Indyk in the Washington Post.
[01:23:04.455 --> 01:23:06.636]  Where he basically threatens the Saudis.
[01:23:06.636 --> 01:23:11.299]  He says, the Saudi system is very fragile, and you better remember that, Saudis.
[01:23:11.299 --> 01:23:13.260]  You better remember that, Bondar.
[01:23:13.260 --> 01:23:15.662]  We're gonna come and get you.
[01:23:15.662 --> 01:23:19.024]  Support for this, in a certain way, comes from unexpected quarters.
[01:23:19.024 --> 01:23:24.267]  Jeff Steinberg, that you recently had on your program, has been following Bondar for two years.
[01:23:24.267 --> 01:23:29.770]  Back in July of 2009, when Bondar was playing the Russian card, and beginning
[01:23:29.950 --> 01:23:43.914]  This is precisely the moment that Steinberg chose to attack Bandar for various issues about scandals and 9-11 and so forth.
[01:23:43.914 --> 01:23:48.476]  Really, those pretexts meaning not very much, but mainly the idea attack Bandar.
[01:23:48.476 --> 01:23:57.979]  And now precisely at the time when Bandar is preparing his trip to Pakistan, which really means an opening to China, we have Steinberg again attacking him.
[01:23:58.799 --> 01:24:07.205]  In the pages of that magazine, in this case it's an article that says the two worst guys in the Middle East are Bandar and Gaddafi.
[01:24:07.205 --> 01:24:08.686]  Now isn't that interesting?
[01:24:08.686 --> 01:24:14.550]  This coincides precisely with the two main people that the US and the British are concerned about.
[01:24:15.130 --> 01:24:15.791]  In the region.
[01:24:15.791 --> 01:24:19.455]  So that's a very, very interesting pattern that we have there.
[01:24:19.455 --> 01:24:22.078]  But the general idea I think is clear.
[01:24:22.078 --> 01:24:26.924]  If Bandar goes to Pakistan, this is a little bit like Nixon going to China, right?
[01:24:26.924 --> 01:24:29.366]  The way you go to China is sometimes through Pakistan.
[01:24:29.366 --> 01:24:31.008]  That's how Nixon did it 40 years ago.
[01:24:31.008 --> 01:24:34.052]  Maybe that's how Bandar is doing it in a certain sense.
[01:24:35.213 --> 01:24:41.801]  Once you're in an alliance with Pakistan, you're also then connected to Pakistan's ally, China.
[01:24:41.801 --> 01:24:46.608]  And I would assume that Bandar has kept up his connections to Putin and to Russia.
[01:24:46.608 --> 01:24:51.173]  Now this gives us Russia, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and China.
[01:24:51.173 --> 01:24:53.076]  Now that's a coherent alliance.
[01:24:53.516 --> 01:24:59.943]  That's a step beyond the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and certainly way beyond the Brits.
[01:24:59.943 --> 01:25:10.313]  The Brits that have just been meeting, that's an interesting group, but in terms of strategy, you've got the fact that India, sitting right in the middle, is essentially an ally of the U.S.
[01:25:10.313 --> 01:25:15.499]  against China, so they may agree economically, but strategically, I don't see how they will.
[01:25:16.039 --> 01:25:25.441]  If we have Russia, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and China, that could become something that would be strategic and military, but it could also become monetary and economic.
[01:25:25.441 --> 01:25:29.903]  That is an alliance with real world-shaping potential.
[01:25:29.903 --> 01:25:35.284]  And again, it's much stronger than these sort of things that we've seen so far.
[01:25:35.284 --> 01:25:40.685]  Now, we are seeing press reports admitting that the West is involved in all this, but that it's not going well.
[01:25:40.685 --> 01:25:42.826]  How do you see this ending right now?
[01:25:43.558 --> 01:25:48.180]  Well, let me just... One other scenario is this guy Michael Shoyer from the CIA, of course.
[01:25:48.180 --> 01:25:50.441]  CIA veteran, was the Bin Laden desk.
[01:25:50.441 --> 01:25:54.262]  I've always called him the head of the Bin Laden fan club in Langley.
[01:25:54.262 --> 01:26:01.005]  He's on television saying that if the Saudis crack down in Bahrain and start killing Shiites,
[01:26:01.625 --> 01:26:09.034]  Then the Iranians will invade Bahrain and essentially be at war with Saudi Arabia and therefore the U.S.
[01:26:09.034 --> 01:26:11.156]  will have to intervene against Iran.
[01:26:16.702 --> 01:26:17.823]  You can see what he's doing.
[01:26:17.823 --> 01:26:23.526]  He's speaking very bluntly, but the whole idea of this is to scare Saudi Arabia back onto the plantation, right?
[01:26:23.526 --> 01:26:25.447]  Back onto the U.S.
[01:26:25.447 --> 01:26:28.448]  imperial ship.
[01:26:28.448 --> 01:26:40.674]  The thing in Libya that you've been mentioning in the news this morning is that British, French, and Italian advisors are going to be present on the ground in Libya with this al-Qaeda infantry, right?
[01:26:40.674 --> 01:26:41.895]  But they've always been there.
[01:26:41.895 --> 01:26:43.476]  Now they're beefing the foursome.
[01:26:44.406 --> 01:26:45.286]  Precisely.
[01:26:45.286 --> 01:26:46.627]  Now they're going to be there openly.
[01:26:46.627 --> 01:26:52.068]  They've been there for six or seven weeks since probably the middle of February and even earlier.
[01:26:52.068 --> 01:26:54.289]  So, this looks like Mission Creep.
[01:26:54.289 --> 01:26:55.569]  Very interesting anniversary.
[01:26:55.569 --> 01:26:58.850]  We just had the 50th anniversary of the Bay of Pigs.
[01:26:58.850 --> 01:27:00.251]  And it's exactly parallel.
[01:27:00.251 --> 01:27:06.893]  Except that when Alan Dulles and his crackpots of the CIA invaded Cuba in April of 1961,
[01:27:08.693 --> 01:27:29.144]  When the first phase failed, when the irregular forces failed to get an insurrection in Cuba, Kennedy was then asked by Allen Dulles, you know, we need air support, we need actual invasion with Marines, and Kennedy said to him, no, I'm not giving you the air support, I'm not giving you the Marines, and by the way, you're fired.
[01:27:29.144 --> 01:27:30.305]  That was a real president.
[01:27:30.305 --> 01:27:36.909]  Well, it came out even on Nightline, excuse me, Frontline, that they fired him, he fired that whole group.
[01:27:37.529 --> 01:27:42.534]  When they brought him Northwoods and said, let's stage terror attacks and blame it on Cuba to invade.
[01:27:42.534 --> 01:27:42.794]  Right.
[01:27:42.794 --> 01:27:49.080]  A number of causes, but certainly within a year after the Bay of Pigs, Alan Fellis was out on his ear.
[01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:52.463]  Tremendous hatred in the CIA for Kennedy ever since.
[01:27:52.463 --> 01:27:55.266]  But what happens now, in this case, Libya is the same example.
[01:27:55.266 --> 01:27:59.390]  You've got a secret army, in this case staffed by Al-Qaeda terrorists.
[01:27:59.870 --> 01:28:05.594]  That you've released from Guantanamo, and they failed to overwhelm Qaddafi.
[01:28:05.594 --> 01:28:07.656]  So now we have the second phase.
[01:28:07.656 --> 01:28:11.338]  What you never saw in the Bay of Pigs, you are seeing now.
[01:28:11.338 --> 01:28:19.905]  You are seeing the mission creep that happens when you don't have a real president, and the CIA comes back and says, look, our secret army is not working.
[01:28:19.905 --> 01:28:21.786]  We need boots on the ground.
[01:28:21.786 --> 01:28:23.427]  We need airstrikes.
[01:28:23.427 --> 01:28:24.288]  We need all this stuff.
[01:28:26.170 --> 01:28:38.382]  And they're saying if as these troops try to march in with humanitarian weapons, if Qaddafi resists in any way, then there'll be an open invasion with the Marines waiting off the coast.
[01:28:38.382 --> 01:28:40.004]  How do you expect that to end?
[01:28:40.004 --> 01:28:43.628]  I mean, they're openly saying, Qaddafi, leave now or we're coming into Tripoli.
[01:28:44.554 --> 01:28:52.979]  Well, that would be another war, and we've seen the Libyans have real guns with real bullets.
[01:28:52.979 --> 01:28:56.061]  Somalia seemed like a very easy invasion.
[01:28:56.061 --> 01:28:58.263]  He's also armed over a million of the citizens.
[01:28:58.971 --> 01:29:00.772]  Yeah, that's actually very interesting.
[01:29:00.772 --> 01:29:03.654]  That's the Lin Piao People's War Doctrine.
[01:29:03.654 --> 01:29:07.396]  And the interesting thing is you can't do that unless you are really popular.
[01:29:07.396 --> 01:29:15.101]  If you don't have a base, now it's largely a tribal base, but it's also a base based on economic performance.
[01:29:15.101 --> 01:29:19.304]  Remember, Libya was the poorest country in Africa, now it's the richest.
[01:29:19.304 --> 01:29:21.365]  And that happened under Gaddafi.
[01:29:21.365 --> 01:29:23.167]  So, that's quite a record.
[01:29:23.167 --> 01:29:25.668]  It's not all bad.
[01:29:25.668 --> 01:29:27.670]  There's also this great man-made river, right?
[01:29:28.470 --> 01:29:31.112]  No, definitely they want to be stabilized.
[01:29:31.112 --> 01:29:37.377]  Webster from the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli will fight our country's battles for the bankers.
[01:29:37.377 --> 01:29:38.879]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:29:38.879 --> 01:29:39.399]  Thank you.
[01:29:39.399 --> 01:29:40.820]  We'll talk to you again very, very soon.
[01:29:40.820 --> 01:29:51.309]  Lord Christopher Monckton straight ahead with key intel on the globalists trying to seize the world's energy infrastructures and how we're striking back.
[01:29:51.309 --> 01:29:52.710]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.710 --> 01:29:54.211]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.237 --> 01:30:01.020]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.020 --> 01:30:09.125]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:30:09.125 --> 01:30:11.666]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:30:11.666 --> 01:30:17.049]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:30:17.049 --> 01:30:20.111]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:30:20.111 --> 01:30:22.152]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:30:22.412 --> 01:30:28.657]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:30:28.657 --> 01:30:32.039]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:30:32.039 --> 01:30:37.823]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:30:37.823 --> 01:30:39.464]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:30:39.464 --> 01:30:40.765]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:30:40.765 --> 01:30:43.267]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:30:43.427 --> 01:30:47.651]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:30:47.651 --> 01:30:52.275]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:30:52.275 --> 01:30:54.857]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[01:31:01.082 --> 01:31:08.048]  Over the last year, Alex has told you about and many of you have experienced emergencies and disasters in unprecedented numbers.
[01:31:08.048 --> 01:31:10.691]  People have had to literally run for their lives.
[01:31:10.691 --> 01:31:13.113]  Folks, this is Steve Schenck with Ifoots Direct.
[01:31:13.113 --> 01:31:17.497]  I'm not here to scare you, but when disaster strikes, you won't have time to think.
[01:31:17.497 --> 01:31:18.978]  You must act automatically.
[01:31:19.198 --> 01:31:22.721]  What does a pilot do when the helicopter engine fails in flight?
[01:31:22.721 --> 01:31:25.484]  No time to think, just act automatically.
[01:31:25.484 --> 01:31:33.832]  When the alert is broadcast, the alarm sounds, or the knock comes on your door, you'll need to be ready to act without thinking of what to do or what you need.
[01:31:33.832 --> 01:31:36.615]  You need a 5-Day Extreme Emergency Kit.
[01:31:36.855 --> 01:31:46.539]  With serious supplies and real food to secure two adults for five days, this powerful $300 Extreme Emergency Kit is free with an order of at least $995 from eFoodsDirect.

[01:32:04.733 --> 01:32:05.994]  Tyranny is here.
[01:32:05.994 --> 01:32:09.916]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:32:09.916 --> 01:32:12.158]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:32:12.158 --> 01:32:18.021]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:32:18.021 --> 01:32:24.265]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:32:24.685 --> 01:32:30.669]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:32:30.669 --> 01:32:34.832]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[01:32:34.832 --> 01:32:39.134]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:32:39.134 --> 01:32:45.078]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:32:45.078 --> 01:32:48.640]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:50.601]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:32:50.601 --> 01:32:51.062]  It's here.

[01:33:11.329 --> 01:33:13.850]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:22.691 --> 01:33:25.393]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:25.393 --> 01:33:26.894]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:33:26.894 --> 01:33:30.317]  It is Wednesday, the 20th day of April, 2011.
[01:33:30.317 --> 01:33:35.541]  And for a little bit into the next hour, Lord Christopher Monckton is going to be our guest.
[01:33:35.541 --> 01:33:39.725]  Then I'm going to get into the latest incredible economic news.
[01:33:39.725 --> 01:33:44.549]  It turns out the Associated Press is confirming the White House tried to get Standard & Poor's
[01:33:45.169 --> 01:33:49.251]  To not start to move towards delisting.
[01:33:49.251 --> 01:33:50.952]  The United States is a triple A rating.
[01:33:50.952 --> 01:33:57.275]  That means that our interest rates will go up on the debt and we'll basically become like Argentina or the Weimar Republic.
[01:33:57.275 --> 01:34:00.537]  That's coming up at the start of the next hour.
[01:34:00.537 --> 01:34:09.702]  I've also got this incredible confirmed news that police all over the country are being issued these wireless systems that download everything off your cell phones without warrants.
[01:34:10.522 --> 01:34:16.564]  Uh, and they're also demanding at checkpoints to grab your phone and plug them in and download everything off of it without warrants.
[01:34:16.564 --> 01:34:24.287]  I mean, this is total 1984 and the phones have been designed under federal law to have the back door for them to do it.
[01:34:25.794 --> 01:34:27.335]  So we're going to be breaking that down.
[01:34:27.335 --> 01:34:32.297]  Brent Krug climbs above $122 on week dollar.
[01:34:32.297 --> 01:34:34.818]  There's the Washington Post article, actually.
[01:34:34.818 --> 01:34:35.658]  AP also has it.
[01:34:35.658 --> 01:34:39.900]  Obama administration officials tried to keep S&P rating at stable.
[01:34:39.900 --> 01:34:49.584]  And they have the nerve to say, upping budgets and raising the debt ceiling, that that will stop a default when S&P and every other major economic institution with common sense.
[01:34:49.584 --> 01:34:50.164]  It's not hard.
[01:34:50.164 --> 01:34:52.385]  It's like saying up is up, down is down.
[01:34:52.385 --> 01:34:54.145]  Left is right.
[01:34:54.145 --> 01:34:54.846]  Black is white.
[01:34:56.326 --> 01:34:56.806]  It's simple.
[01:34:56.806 --> 01:34:57.707]  We're saying up is up.
[01:34:57.707 --> 01:34:59.227]  They're saying up is down.
[01:34:59.227 --> 01:35:00.708]  It's amazing.
[01:35:00.708 --> 01:35:10.131]  And then meanwhile, they're saying no more debt will keep us from defaulting when we're actually technically defaulting because they're now hyperinflating and monetizing over 70% of the T-bills.
[01:35:10.131 --> 01:35:11.812]  But that's coming up next hour.
[01:35:11.812 --> 01:35:20.815]  And then Steve Watson, writer for InfoWars.com and PresentPlanet.com joins us from London via video Skype as well to break down things like the Royal Wedding and the Republicans
[01:35:21.235 --> 01:35:24.337]  Aren't allowed to go out and protest, but everybody else is allowed to celebrate.
[01:35:24.337 --> 01:35:34.144]  We'll also get his view as a political scientist on what's happening with the situation in Libya and in the Middle East.
[01:35:34.144 --> 01:35:46.733]  But Lord Christopher Monckton III, Viscount of Monckton and Brentley, is the leading, there's no doubt, defender of science and reality when it comes to the fraud that is man-made global warming and the
[01:35:47.273 --> 01:35:50.959]  Ken Lay Al Gore plan to tax all human activity.
[01:35:50.959 --> 01:35:57.169]  He's a British politician, public speaker, former newspaper editor, an hereditary peer, formerly a member of the Conservative Party.
[01:35:57.169 --> 01:36:00.094]  He now formerly also headed up the UK Independence Party.
[01:36:01.391 --> 01:36:07.033]  He served in the Conservative Central Office, also worked as one of the top advisors on science to Margaret Thatcher at No.
[01:36:07.033 --> 01:36:09.654]  10 Policy Unit in the 1980s.
[01:36:09.654 --> 01:36:13.575]  He also worked for the Universe, the Sunny Telegraph today, and the Evening Standard.
[01:36:13.575 --> 01:36:18.897]  His website is scienceandpublicpolicy.org, or UKIP.org.
[01:36:18.897 --> 01:36:20.657]  And here are the headlines today.
[01:36:20.657 --> 01:36:22.378]  We'll cover this first before we get into the latest.
[01:36:23.058 --> 01:36:27.241]  on the social engineers trying to seize the energy sources of the world.
[01:36:27.241 --> 01:36:29.903]  UKIP launched their manifesto.
[01:36:29.903 --> 01:36:35.666]  Manifesto reveals intention for tough approach and we're going to be breaking that down of course.
[01:36:35.666 --> 01:36:40.850]  Nigel Farage of the UK Independence Party in the EU Parliament from England.
[01:36:40.850 --> 01:36:43.772]  Also a frequent guest here and survived that plane crash.
[01:36:43.772 --> 01:36:44.953]  We're very thankful for that.
[01:36:44.953 --> 01:36:48.315]  Lord Monckton, thank you for joining us today from Scotland.
[01:36:49.372 --> 01:36:51.416]  Alex, as always, it's a pleasure.
[01:36:51.416 --> 01:36:56.604]  I'm sitting here in Edinburgh in my apartment overlooking Edinburgh Castle.
[01:36:56.604 --> 01:37:01.252]  The sun is shining, the weather is good, and the politics are lousy.
[01:37:03.820 --> 01:37:19.871]  For those that don't know who the UK Independence Party is in the US, it's basically similar to the Tea Party or the Ron Paul type folks that openly speak out against the global government, openly quote the scallywags on their plans and openly fight them.
[01:37:19.871 --> 01:37:26.055]  And your party, not just in the UK but in Europe, similar groups are exploding and gaining ground.
[01:37:26.055 --> 01:37:30.618]  Tell us about this new D-Day invasion of the New World Order system.
[01:37:32.065 --> 01:37:41.156]  Well, what is happening now is that in Britain, the United Kingdom Independence Party is very much on the march.
[01:37:41.156 --> 01:37:51.628]  We only were founded 17 years ago by an academic, and now suddenly we have grown into being the second biggest party
[01:37:52.128 --> 01:37:58.530]  In British politics, in European Parliament elections, because the European Parliament isn't a real Parliament.
[01:37:58.530 --> 01:38:00.051]  It's not like your Congress.
[01:38:00.051 --> 01:38:01.491]  It can't make laws.
[01:38:01.491 --> 01:38:05.512]  It's just a kind of talking shop like the Dumas of John Nicholas II.
[01:38:05.512 --> 01:38:07.493]  But it shows the will of the British people.
[01:38:09.022 --> 01:38:28.363]  So the will of the British people, it does show the will because we came second, we beat everybody except the Conservatives that time, and then in the recent by-election for the British Parliament, in the seat of Barnsley where the former Labour member is now serving time in prison for having fiddled his expenses,
[01:38:29.624 --> 01:38:38.433]  We came second beating the Conservative and Liberal parties who formed the coalition government here, and coming second only to the Labour Party.
[01:38:38.433 --> 01:38:42.497]  And if you put up a donkey for the Labour Party in Barnsley, it's an old mining constituency.
[01:38:42.497 --> 01:38:44.439]  It's Arthur Scargill's headquarters.
[01:38:44.439 --> 01:38:45.960]  They'll always vote Labour there.
[01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:47.522]  But UKIP came second.
[01:38:48.062 --> 01:38:52.425]  Now we're fighting local government elections all around Britain.
[01:38:52.425 --> 01:38:55.087]  We have local government elections in England.
[01:38:55.087 --> 01:39:00.391]  We have Scottish Parliament elections in Scotland and the Welsh Assembly elections in Wales.
[01:39:00.391 --> 01:39:02.713]  UKIP are contesting all three.
[01:39:02.713 --> 01:39:09.478]  I am leading the UKIP effort in Scotland and in particular we're beginning to make some headway because the
[01:39:10.473 --> 01:39:33.678]  Scottish National Party, which effectively is communist, they are at present the ruling clique in the Scottish Parliament, and they came out with a manifesto earlier in the week in which they said that they were going to generate 100% of Scotland's electricity by so-called renewable means, which they mainly mean windmills, in just nine years' time.
[01:39:34.458 --> 01:39:48.103]  And I found myself at a Hustings just a few days ago opposite Rosanna Cunningham, who is the so-called environment so-called minister for the so-called Scottish so-called government.
[01:39:48.103 --> 01:39:50.444]  And she knows nothing about the environment.
[01:39:50.444 --> 01:39:51.805]  Of course, most politicians don't.
[01:39:52.561 --> 01:39:52.721]  I don't
[01:40:08.257 --> 01:40:19.742]  As far as last December, when we had no wind for an entire month, we had the second coldest winter in Britain since records began in 1659.
[01:40:19.742 --> 01:40:22.123]  That's what global warming means to us at the moment.
[01:40:22.123 --> 01:40:23.743]  It was very, very cold.
[01:40:23.743 --> 01:40:35.328]  And the percentage of UK and Scottish electricity contributed by all the wind farms that we have over that bitterly cold month, and we needed all the electricity we could get, was at 0.0%.
[01:40:38.132 --> 01:40:38.554]  Amazing.
[01:40:38.554 --> 01:40:43.188]  But to be clear, you are now standing for the Scottish Parliament.
[01:40:43.188 --> 01:40:45.174]  You are now running for office.
[01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:46.920]  That's right.
[01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:49.602]  It's most unlikely that I'll succeed this time round.
[01:40:49.602 --> 01:40:53.385]  We're not the kind of politicians that pretend we're going to win when it's clear we're not.
[01:40:53.385 --> 01:40:57.407]  We're too new in Scotland to expect to storm the gates yet.
[01:40:57.407 --> 01:41:00.770]  And the press here are terrified of us.
[01:41:00.770 --> 01:41:12.938]  But here they are with the SNP, the ruling faction here, coming out with this mad, I mean, heroically lunatic policy of generating electricity with the wind.
[01:41:12.938 --> 01:41:15.239]  And at huge cost to taxpayers, of course.
[01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:29.665]  ...elections, that has from the outset opposed all these stupid windmills, is the United Kingdom Independence Party, and can we get ourselves onto a television programme or into a newspaper?
[01:41:29.665 --> 01:41:31.146]  Virtually not at all.
[01:41:31.146 --> 01:41:45.491]  They will not let us anywhere near the media here, because it's a closed shop, it's a little kind of Marxist cosy between the Liberals and the Socialists and the SNP, and which of them is more Communist is not for me to say, but they're all pretty far to the left.
[01:41:46.151 --> 01:41:48.032]  And the media up here exactly the same.
[01:41:48.032 --> 01:41:49.692]  They don't want the truth told.
[01:41:49.692 --> 01:41:51.832]  They don't want the voice of democracy to be heard.
[01:41:51.832 --> 01:41:55.333]  And I'll give you a little vignette which will really make you laugh, Alex.
[01:41:55.333 --> 01:41:57.034]  This was absolutely wonderful.
[01:41:57.034 --> 01:42:06.696]  When Nigel Farage, who's a regular guest on your show, came up very kindly to support me and do the launch in Edinburgh of UKIP's manifesto,
[01:42:07.879 --> 01:42:15.287]  One of the topics on that manifesto is that we want to give people the same right as they have in Switzerland.
[01:42:15.287 --> 01:42:29.962]  So that if the people think that the governing class is not representing them on a particular subject that matters to the people, they can call a referendum if 1% of them sign a request saying we want a referendum.
[01:42:29.962 --> 01:42:30.362]  A recall!
[01:42:31.543 --> 01:42:32.684]  Yeah, exactly that.
[01:42:32.684 --> 01:42:45.970]  And then that referendum on any subject they like has to be held, and the result is binding on the Scottish Parliament, the Westminster Parliament, and of course the unelected dismal commissars of Europe.
[01:42:45.970 --> 01:42:47.471]  And that was our policy.
[01:42:47.471 --> 01:42:55.315]  Now, I was interviewed by a BBC reporter who, it was quite clear, was again from the Marxist wing of the BBC, which means about 99.9% of it.
[01:42:57.456 --> 01:43:03.661]  And I said to her, just a matter of interest, what did you think of the idea of letting the people decide what matters to them?
[01:43:03.661 --> 01:43:05.182]  And this was her reply.
[01:43:05.182 --> 01:43:06.823]  It's classic BBC.
[01:43:06.823 --> 01:43:08.484]  It's classic Marxism.
[01:43:08.484 --> 01:43:13.027]  And it really illustrates the problem that democracy now faces, really, worldwide.
[01:43:13.027 --> 01:43:13.348]  She said,
[01:43:14.148 --> 01:43:15.330]  Of course you don't.
[01:43:15.330 --> 01:43:21.717]  The thing about the people is that if you let them decide what matters, they will vote for trivialities, won't they?
[01:43:21.717 --> 01:43:24.940]  They'll vote for trivial things, things that don't matter.
[01:43:24.940 --> 01:43:29.606]  That was the absolute, instinctual, profound, deeply held contempt.
[01:43:30.336 --> 01:43:31.137]  Well, I want you to go...
[01:43:53.860 --> 01:44:02.108]  Sure, I want you to go over that, Lord Monckton, but first, digressing back, since you raised this, same thing here in the U.S.
[01:44:02.108 --> 01:44:12.498]  They create regional governments that are basically appointed by the federal bureaucracy and then they tell the counties, the cities, the states what to do.
[01:44:13.439 --> 01:44:24.909]  And you've got Obama telling the EPA to shut down coal power plants and other plants and even hydroelectric dams with no law behind him.
[01:44:24.909 --> 01:44:27.191]  And then when states stand up against them,
[01:44:28.283 --> 01:44:30.844]  The feds will come in and even seize the facilities.
[01:44:30.844 --> 01:44:37.067]  But meanwhile, General Electric, who paid no taxes last year, they head up the President's Economic Council.
[01:44:37.067 --> 01:44:42.789]  Obama has given them waivers to open new plants and not upgrade their dirty coal plants.
[01:44:42.789 --> 01:44:47.911]  But everyone else, basically, the head of the Energy Department has said they're going to start shutting down.
[01:44:49.392 --> 01:44:52.693]  People call them mindless environmentalists or well-meaning idiots.
[01:44:52.693 --> 01:44:53.574]  They're not idiots.
[01:44:53.574 --> 01:44:59.876]  They're gangsters creating oligopolies, creating monopolies, shutting down their competition.
[01:44:59.876 --> 01:45:06.118]  And it's the same thing in England where you have government-funded media and then they won't let the UK Independence Party get on TV.
[01:45:06.118 --> 01:45:10.860]  But regardless, you guys run a couple times in every new area and then start winning.
[01:45:11.480 --> 01:45:14.302]  As people hear your common sense being injected.
[01:45:14.302 --> 01:45:25.070]  So for those that don't know, describe how over 70% of UK laws are handed down from the EU because this is something a lot of Americas don't understand.
[01:45:26.297 --> 01:45:28.279]  That's a very good point, and it's actually 83%.
[01:45:28.279 --> 01:45:44.632]  It's five laws in six handed down by the unelected commissars, that is the official German title for them, the commissars, that hated communist term for the people who ran the Soviet government.
[01:45:44.632 --> 01:45:46.774]  The commissars, the whole Soviet constitution
[01:45:46.834 --> 01:45:47.534]  Let's move westward.
[01:45:47.534 --> 01:45:55.836]  83% of Europe's laws, and that includes Britain's laws and Scotland's laws, are made by people that nobody elects.
[01:45:55.836 --> 01:45:57.456]  We can't hold them to account.
[01:45:57.456 --> 01:45:58.456]  We can't question them.
[01:45:58.456 --> 01:46:00.096]  We don't even know who they are.
[01:46:00.096 --> 01:46:02.897]  We can't remove them, and we can't replace them.
[01:46:02.897 --> 01:46:05.917]  These people are the enemies of freedom and democracy.
[01:46:05.917 --> 01:46:15.499]  They have their own agenda, which is not an agenda which you or I or the vast majority of good red-blooded Americans, Alex, would ever dream of going along with.
[01:46:16.100 --> 01:46:18.023]  And they make the laws.
[01:46:18.023 --> 01:46:20.126]  And shall I describe how they do it?
[01:46:20.126 --> 01:46:22.389]  Because it is a fascinating process.
[01:46:22.389 --> 01:46:26.396]  And it starts by them meeting in secret.
[01:46:27.378 --> 01:46:29.119]  And directive, as you know, is the root of dictator.
[01:46:55.441 --> 01:46:56.021]  That's it.
[01:46:56.021 --> 01:47:02.302]  It is an instruction from our new masters on how we are to behave.
[01:47:02.302 --> 01:47:16.405]  And the so-called parliaments of the individual member states, like the Westminster Parliament and the Scottish Parliament, it is their duty to enact these directives into the law of the individual member states.
[01:47:16.405 --> 01:47:24.567]  And if they don't, then the government can be fined unlimited amounts of money by the commissars until they do comply.
[01:47:25.618 --> 01:47:31.706]  And so what happens is that the first stage of the law is this directive is proposed in secret.
[01:47:31.706 --> 01:47:43.480]  Then it is passed from the Commissars to another secret committee, indeed a committee so secret that until just a few months ago, its very existence was not even mentioned.
[01:47:44.020 --> 01:47:46.441]  On the European Union's own website.
[01:47:46.441 --> 01:47:49.342]  And this is the Committee of Permanent Representatives.
[01:47:49.342 --> 01:47:52.963]  By the very phrase permanent, you can tell that they're not elected.
[01:47:52.963 --> 01:47:55.784]  Because election is not a permanent state.
[01:47:55.784 --> 01:47:58.785]  But they are appointed bureaucrats.
[01:47:58.785 --> 01:48:00.266]  Nobody knows who they are.
[01:48:00.266 --> 01:48:07.108]  They meet in secret to do what you in Congress would call a mark-up, which is the detailed consideration of the legislation.
[01:48:07.108 --> 01:48:08.489]  And we would call the committee stage.
[01:48:09.404 --> 01:48:16.427]  And that, again, we would do it in public, you do it in public, they do it in secret, and they are not elected to do it.
[01:48:16.427 --> 01:48:20.389]  Then it goes from them to, would you believe, a third
[01:48:21.172 --> 01:48:23.513]  Body, also meeting in secret.
[01:48:23.513 --> 01:48:25.494]  This one is called the Council of Ministers.
[01:48:25.494 --> 01:48:26.775]  You think, aren't ministers?
[01:48:26.775 --> 01:48:28.055]  Perhaps they're elected.
[01:48:28.055 --> 01:48:28.856]  Yes, they are.
[01:48:28.856 --> 01:48:30.917]  But they don't sit on the Council of Ministers.
[01:48:30.917 --> 01:48:32.637]  Well, not very often, anyway.
[01:48:32.637 --> 01:48:49.365]  Normally, the Council of Ministers is, you've guessed it, another group of unelected bureaucrats meeting in secret to decide whether the law proposed by the Commissars and worked on by this committee of permanent representatives shall become the supreme law of Europe.
[01:48:49.825 --> 01:48:53.066]  And if they say no, that's the end of it.
[01:48:53.066 --> 01:49:00.709]  If they say yes, then and only then, it is put in front of the only elected institution in Europe.
[01:49:00.709 --> 01:49:03.890]  This is the European Talking Shop, or it's called a Parliament.
[01:49:03.890 --> 01:49:05.790]  That's a joke word for it, really.
[01:49:05.790 --> 01:49:10.632]  And the Talking Shop can express an opinion, but it cannot decide the legislation.
[01:49:10.632 --> 01:49:13.053]  It cannot either decide in favour or against.
[01:49:13.053 --> 01:49:15.174]  All it can do is express an opinion.
[01:49:15.174 --> 01:49:16.054]  If it says yes,
[01:49:16.674 --> 01:49:26.458]  Then the legislation, even then, doesn't necessarily go through, because the Commissars have been known to put forward kind of stalking horse legislation they don't want to go through.
[01:49:26.458 --> 01:49:29.580]  So then it goes through all these stages, wasting everybody's time.
[01:49:29.580 --> 01:49:34.902]  Then the Commissars say, we want to show who's boss, and we're going to not let that legislation proceed.
[01:49:34.902 --> 01:49:38.364]  And so they can then overrule the European Elected Union.
[01:49:38.364 --> 01:49:42.886]  And it goes on and on, but the reason this is important for people in North... I'm asking you about the next stage.
[01:49:42.886 --> 01:49:43.066]  Oh, oh.
[01:49:44.747 --> 01:49:45.728]  One more stage.
[01:49:45.728 --> 01:49:54.094]  It then goes to the Parliament of the Member States for debate, but of course we don't get debate in our Parliament on this.
[01:49:54.094 --> 01:50:04.783]  It goes to the Legislative Scrutiny Committee of the House of Commons, and you've guessed it, that's the only committee of the House of Commons that meets behind closed doors in secret.
[01:50:04.783 --> 01:50:06.384]  Now if you read the Madison Papers,
[01:50:06.924 --> 01:50:31.515]  And you see how insistent they were that the Congress that they created with Article 1, Section 1 of your great Constitution of Liberty, was to meet in public so that those who had elected the members of both houses of Congress, of course it was one house originally, but now both houses of Congress, could see what it was that those whom they had elected were doing and saying on their behalf.
[01:50:31.515 --> 01:50:35.937]  Democracy doesn't work unless legislation is considered in public.
[01:50:36.397 --> 01:50:48.263]  But every state of the legislation that is now imposed upon us from Europe is conducted in secret and nearly every state is conducted by people whom we do not elect.
[01:50:48.263 --> 01:50:51.745]  Whatever else this is, Alex, it is not democracy.
[01:50:51.745 --> 01:50:55.007]  It's a dictatorship of the Commissars.
[01:50:55.007 --> 01:50:55.567]  Stay there.
[01:50:55.567 --> 01:50:56.667]  I've got a key point to add.
[01:50:56.667 --> 01:50:59.669]  Then we'll talk about their latest agenda on the other side with Lord Monckton.
[01:51:01.519 --> 01:51:04.502]  If you suffer from poor sleep, you need MyPillow.
[01:51:04.502 --> 01:51:07.444]  Guaranteed to be the most comfortable pillow you will ever own.

[01:53:04.929 --> 01:53:07.370]  Concerned about nuclear contamination?
[01:53:07.370 --> 01:53:08.530]  You're not alone.
[01:53:08.530 --> 01:53:16.512]  If you understand the risk of today's food being contaminated from nuclear fallout, you would not only trust wild food for survival, you'd count on it.
[01:53:16.512 --> 01:53:19.953]  Wild food is the most prolific, fastest growing food available.
[01:53:19.953 --> 01:53:27.375]  It's fresh, because it doesn't sit in the field for 8 to 10 weeks being fertilized or sprayed with pesticides, accumulating radiation.
[01:53:27.375 --> 01:53:29.456]  And wild food is not genetically altered.
[01:53:29.796 --> 01:53:37.261]  Ounce for ounce, wild food has more nutrition and less harmful elements than any animal or commercial agriculturally grown food.
[01:53:37.261 --> 01:53:39.002]  It can detoxify the body.
[01:53:39.002 --> 01:53:40.043]  And the best part?
[01:53:40.043 --> 01:53:42.264]  Wild food is free for the taking.
[01:53:42.264 --> 01:53:48.789]  Let author Linda Runyon show you how to identify, harvest, prepare, eat, and store wild food.

[01:53:59.976 --> 01:54:09.659]  Okay, we're going to have Lord Monkton five minutes into the next hour with us, and I'm going to shift gears into all the other news.
[01:54:09.659 --> 01:54:18.521]  But the point I was starting to get to before the break is, why is what's happening in the EU so important to what's happening here?
[01:54:18.521 --> 01:54:26.383]  It is this same system of unelected bureaucracies, basically bought and paid for by private corrupt interest, that are usurping
[01:54:27.580 --> 01:54:35.949]  Republican, Republic, Democratic forms of government all over the world and we're entering into the same system here.
[01:54:35.949 --> 01:54:41.435]  They've already set up the SPP, North American Union, by stealth.
[01:54:41.435 --> 01:54:43.677]  Lord Monckton's studying these systems.
[01:54:43.677 --> 01:54:47.821]  Is there not a continuity of agenda through the bureaucratic class?
[01:54:49.324 --> 01:54:49.824]  Yes, there is.
[01:54:49.824 --> 01:54:59.572]  I mean, it's very clear that the European model, which is tyranny by Clark, as we call it, is that's the model they're now going to try and spread worldwide.
[01:54:59.572 --> 01:55:01.453]  They've grown tired of democracy.
[01:55:01.453 --> 01:55:07.017]  They don't like voters coming along and saying, we don't like the arrangements you have made for us.
[01:55:07.017 --> 01:55:08.678]  We want another lot to take charge.
[01:55:08.678 --> 01:55:09.459]  They hate that.
[01:55:10.114 --> 01:55:17.819]  They hate being thrown out after they've had all the trappings and motorcars and red boxes and everybody calling them Minister and Secretary of State.
[01:55:17.819 --> 01:55:19.240]  They love all that.
[01:55:19.240 --> 01:55:21.261]  And they don't like it taken away.
[01:55:21.261 --> 01:55:26.705]  And they realise the way to make sure it never gets taken away again is simply to take democracy away.
[01:55:26.705 --> 01:55:33.349]  And so the European Union was set up right from the start with elaborate care to make sure that at no point
[01:55:33.929 --> 01:55:37.872]  Did democracy get anywhere near the real decision-making?
[01:55:37.872 --> 01:56:00.025]  And so when it came to setting up the world government which the UN would like to set up to save the planet from supposed climate change, they used EU advisors and their fingers were all over the documents I read in Cancun last December at the latest round of this kind of rolling international conference they have.
[01:56:00.025 --> 01:56:00.946]  And it's quite clear
[01:56:01.821 --> 01:56:09.549]  That they've decided the way to go is the EU way, but without even bothering to have the fig leaf of an elected parliament.
[01:56:09.549 --> 01:56:11.510]  They're not even going to have it as a fig leaf.
[01:56:11.510 --> 01:56:17.136]  It's going to be openly anti-democratic, and they reckon they're going to get away with it.
[01:56:17.136 --> 01:56:23.302]  Well, I reckon they're not, because one of the things that's happening is that when I first began talking about world government,
[01:56:23.762 --> 01:56:31.286]  People said to me, oh yes, you're another World Government conspiracy theorist, pointy head, don't you have more sense than that?
[01:56:31.286 --> 01:56:41.751]  So the first person that said this to me was Kevin Libin, who was a journalist, a very distinguished journalist actually, on the National Post in Canada, which is a very major newspaper.
[01:56:42.491 --> 01:56:50.198]  And I had been speaking to the Petroleum Club of Calgary about two years ago, three years ago, and I said, this world government is coming.
[01:56:50.198 --> 01:56:51.760]  The treaty is already in draft.
[01:56:51.760 --> 01:56:55.123]  This was the draft Copenhagen treaty that eventually failed.
[01:56:55.123 --> 01:56:57.425]  But I said, it's quite clear that what they want is world government.
[01:56:57.425 --> 01:57:00.668]  And he came up after and said, oh, world government, world government, this is nonsense.
[01:57:00.668 --> 01:57:02.189]  You know, this is just a conspiracy theory.
[01:57:02.189 --> 01:57:03.831]  I said, I have three words for you, Kevin.
[01:57:03.831 --> 01:57:04.391]  He said, what?
[01:57:04.391 --> 01:57:06.333]  I said, read the treaty.
[01:57:07.481 --> 01:57:08.481]  He said, you mean there is one?
[01:57:08.481 --> 01:57:11.222]  I said, do you think I'd just sit here and make stuff up?
[01:57:11.222 --> 01:57:12.982]  So I sent him a copy of it.
[01:57:12.982 --> 01:57:14.143]  And an hour later, he rang back.
[01:57:14.143 --> 01:57:16.963]  He said, this is 10 times worse than you ever told me.
[01:57:16.963 --> 01:57:17.964]  He said, it's really dreadful.
[01:57:17.964 --> 01:57:21.605]  I'm going to put it all over the front page of the National Post, which he did.
[01:57:21.605 --> 01:57:26.566]  And within a week, he was on secondment for six months to the Prime Minister of Canada to make absolutely sure.
[01:57:27.458 --> 01:57:27.958]  I think so.
[01:57:57.378 --> 01:57:58.159]  We're good to go.
[01:58:26.437 --> 01:58:30.199]  He can no longer get away with saying it was all George Bush's fault.
[01:58:30.199 --> 01:58:34.541]  He has added three times as much debt as was there when George Bush left.
[01:58:34.541 --> 01:58:35.982]  Absolutely, Lord Monckton.
[01:58:35.982 --> 01:58:36.702]  Got to break.
[01:58:36.702 --> 01:58:37.623]  Five more minutes with you.
[01:58:37.623 --> 01:58:39.403]  We'll conclude on the other side.
[01:58:39.403 --> 01:58:46.147]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:46.147 --> 01:58:48.308]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.485 --> 01:58:58.148]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:58:58.148 --> 01:59:03.290]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:59:03.290 --> 01:59:12.014]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:59:12.014 --> 01:59:16.096]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:59:16.096 --> 01:59:18.037]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.

[01:59:54.102 --> 01:59:56.484]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.484 --> 02:00:05.851]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.851 --> 02:00:07.152]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.152 --> 02:00:08.933]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.933 --> 02:00:10.694]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.694 --> 02:00:12.275]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.275 --> 02:00:13.556]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.556 --> 02:00:18.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:22.063]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.271 --> 02:00:31.743]  Well, we were going to have Lord Mongeon for just 30 minutes, but he's graciously staying with us another 20 because I've got a bunch of questions we haven't even gotten into.
[02:00:31.743 --> 02:00:33.725]  I constantly study the
[02:00:35.239 --> 02:00:35.759]  We're good to go.
[02:00:54.554 --> 02:01:11.660]  How they're trying to counter-strike back at the forces of liberty with literally the leading mind, and believe me, I do a lot of research, folks, he's the leading guy who's been 100% spot on in all his mathematical calculations on what he broke down about what were frauds the UN had put out.
[02:01:11.660 --> 02:01:13.640]  I mean, almost like he has a crystal ball.
[02:01:13.640 --> 02:01:14.741]  Lord Christopher Monckton.
[02:01:15.501 --> 02:01:19.884]  Eighteen months ago, Jason McGoldrick, who had gone over to Hungary to set up a company there, which had failed, came back to the UK
[02:01:45.555 --> 02:01:56.842]  A few months after that, the Serious Organized Crime Agency, that's RKGB, kicks down the door of his house at three in the morning.
[02:01:57.950 --> 02:02:03.136]  Took him away without telling his wife and family where they were taking him.
[02:02:03.136 --> 02:02:08.843]  Took him in front of a judge in London who had no power to stop what was happening next.
[02:02:08.843 --> 02:02:15.852]  And put him on a plane to Hungary at the request of the prosecuting authorities there who said they were ready to prosecute him for fraud.
[02:02:16.827 --> 02:02:23.129]  They, there was no hearing to discover whether there was any evidence against him before he was shipped off overseas.
[02:02:23.129 --> 02:02:34.031]  Habeas Corpus, which is written into Magna Carta, I was reading it in the original Latin only the other day, has now been taken away by this procedure called the European Arrest Warrant.
[02:02:34.031 --> 02:02:40.373]  He was flung into jail without his parents or anybody or his children knowing or his wife knowing where he was.
[02:02:40.373 --> 02:02:45.854]  He was fed on rancid pork fat three times a day, which is effectively torture.
[02:02:46.634 --> 02:02:52.658]  Under UK law, anyone who did that to you would be prosecuted for torture, and that's a very serious criminal offence.
[02:02:52.658 --> 02:02:59.943]  And he was kept there for four months, and he got in touch with a Conservative Member of the European Parliament.
[02:02:59.943 --> 02:03:05.527]  And now you'll know why I'm not a Conservative, because that Conservative Member of the European Parliament said to him, I don't care.
[02:03:06.454 --> 02:03:14.501]  Whether you say you're innocent or not, if one of our fellow governments in the European Union says you're guilty, that's enough for me.
[02:03:14.501 --> 02:03:17.183]  We don't need trials these days.
[02:03:17.183 --> 02:03:20.466]  And you can stay right where you are and I'm not lifting a finger to help you.
[02:03:21.437 --> 02:03:24.980]  And that was the extraordinary reply this man got, eventually, in prison.
[02:03:24.980 --> 02:03:33.287]  So he got in touch with my noble friend, the Earl of Dartmouth, who is a sitting member of the European Parliament, in the UKIP interest, United Kingdom Independence Party.
[02:03:33.287 --> 02:03:34.368]  He said to him, will you help?
[02:03:34.368 --> 02:03:40.213]  And Dartmouth got on the next plane, went to the prison, and got him out.
[02:03:40.213 --> 02:03:40.974]  And got him home.
[02:03:42.313 --> 02:03:43.934]  I've got to stop you, sir.
[02:03:43.934 --> 02:03:45.416]  Sir, I was not aware of this.
[02:03:45.416 --> 02:03:46.557]  I knew this was going on.
[02:03:46.557 --> 02:03:54.544]  I have seen on our local news, they bring Japanese police here and are signing deals to allow them to grab U.S.
[02:03:54.544 --> 02:03:55.404]  citizens.
[02:03:55.404 --> 02:03:57.246]  They bring EU police here.
[02:03:57.246 --> 02:03:58.987]  They send our police there.
[02:03:58.987 --> 02:03:59.848]  It's unelected.
[02:03:59.848 --> 02:04:01.990]  There are no laws.
[02:04:01.990 --> 02:04:03.791]  They just do whatever they want.
[02:04:03.791 --> 02:04:06.133]  And this is this new world order system.
[02:04:07.113 --> 02:04:17.080]  Well, as long as it's a EU-UN member, you are now under their laws, and they're now saying Americans will be under the anti-free speech laws of Canada via this SPP.
[02:04:17.080 --> 02:04:31.670]  We're going to break, but I want to come back and give you the floor, because some stations don't carry this segment, to recap this story in great detail and get into it, because there's so many facets to this, and you bring them all up, and for those that aren't concerned,
[02:04:32.310 --> 02:04:52.334]  This is one of the main reasons we had 1776 in this country is because they had kangaroo courts and the king and bureaucrats would haul colonists, who were British citizens, onto boats and deprive them of English law and Magna Carta and take them to these kangaroo courts, sometimes in other possessions.
[02:04:52.334 --> 02:04:54.695]  I mean, this is as tyrannical as it gets.
[02:04:54.695 --> 02:04:57.435]  Lord Christopher Monckton, this is unbelievable.
[02:04:57.435 --> 02:04:59.956]  We're going to pull some news articles up on this when we come back.
[02:04:59.956 --> 02:05:00.456]  Unbelievable.
[02:05:00.996 --> 02:05:05.537]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:05:05.537 --> 02:05:06.457]  Number 1.
[02:05:06.457 --> 02:05:09.878]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:09.878 --> 02:05:10.738]  Number 2.
[02:05:10.738 --> 02:05:15.619]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:05:15.619 --> 02:05:16.379]  It's true.
[02:05:16.379 --> 02:05:21.240]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:21.240 --> 02:05:22.060]  Number 3.
[02:05:22.060 --> 02:05:25.661]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:05:25.661 --> 02:05:29.342]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:05:29.562 --> 02:05:30.362]  Number 4.
[02:05:30.362 --> 02:05:33.123]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:05:33.123 --> 02:05:36.804]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:05:36.804 --> 02:05:37.585]  Number 5.
[02:05:37.585 --> 02:05:41.746]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:05:41.746 --> 02:05:46.788]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:06:24.824 --> 02:06:31.350]  Since 1947, Calvin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[02:06:31.350 --> 02:06:32.851]  Buy American and stay clean.

[02:06:54.217 --> 02:06:54.658]  Thank you!
[02:07:01.747 --> 02:07:05.771]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:07:05.771 --> 02:07:09.014]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:07:09.014 --> 02:07:13.818]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:07:13.818 --> 02:07:20.204]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:07:20.204 --> 02:07:22.447]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:07:22.987 --> 02:07:23.287]  Tim Geithner?
[02:07:23.287 --> 02:07:23.807]  Bernanke?
[02:07:23.807 --> 02:07:24.468]  They're arsonists!
[02:07:24.468 --> 02:07:25.748]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:07:25.748 --> 02:07:27.990]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:07:41.877 --> 02:07:43.738]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:07:43.738 --> 02:07:49.161]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[02:07:49.161 --> 02:08:01.608]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:08:01.608 --> 02:08:07.172]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:08.840 --> 02:08:27.341]  I remember more than a decade ago interviewing constitutional law scholars, people like Congressman Ron Paul, others, who pointed out that under the EU system and the UN Global Governance Model, they put all this out officially, their plan, and they teach it at Model UN for high school and college students.
[02:08:27.341 --> 02:08:28.322]  I've been to these events.
[02:08:28.322 --> 02:08:29.564]  I've had family that was part of it.
[02:08:30.919 --> 02:08:42.667]  That someone from Japan can come arrest me here if I violate a free speech law that Japan says is illegal, or the Canadian government that arrests preachers for reading anti-homosexual stuff out of the Bible.
[02:08:42.667 --> 02:08:45.409]  Regardless of what you think of that, it's their right.
[02:08:45.409 --> 02:08:54.495]  But now I've seen more and more articles about the EU and all their new Eastern European members, where they have total police state rules in place.
[02:08:54.495 --> 02:08:58.919]  It's the old Soviet Union model, and they're arresting British citizens and others.
[02:08:59.879 --> 02:09:14.626]  And Lord Monckton was getting into a case, I want him to recap it and get into more detail, of Jason McGoldrick, and no real judge, no real charges, basically put in a Third World style gulag.
[02:09:14.626 --> 02:09:18.468]  There's the headline, Britain held in Hungarian prison to make legal bid.
[02:09:19.068 --> 02:09:29.156]  And we've got a whole bunch of other mainstream news articles admitting all of this, where you're seized, not for violating a UK law, something that would be illegal in the UK, and then you're not even given a trial.
[02:09:29.156 --> 02:09:35.521]  And Lord Moxham was talking about a Conservative member of the EU Parliament from England, so-called Conservative, saying, we don't need trials anymore.
[02:09:35.521 --> 02:09:43.087]  And I remember in 1998, reading the headline, Tony Blair, BBC, the Magna Carta is dead under EU law.
[02:09:43.087 --> 02:09:46.290]  And they were proud of it, flaunting it, throwing it.
[02:09:46.750 --> 02:09:50.212]  And so before we get into this, Lord Monckton, in the time we have left, it's so important.
[02:09:50.212 --> 02:10:01.320]  For those that don't know about 1215 Runnymede, the root of what became British liberty and then the model of the Republic here, habeas corpus, every man's home is his castle.
[02:10:01.320 --> 02:10:05.022]  For those that don't know, this was the beginning of the end of serfdom.
[02:10:05.022 --> 02:10:07.564]  They're trying to bring us back in to serfdom.
[02:10:09.059 --> 02:10:11.542]  This is exactly the point, Alex.
[02:10:11.542 --> 02:10:19.269]  Magna Carta was signed by King John with his barons because previously the kings ruled by absolute decree.
[02:10:19.269 --> 02:10:23.454]  Eventually the barons said, no, we're not having that.
[02:10:24.665 --> 02:10:36.636]  We want to share power with you, and we want to make sure that every citizen of this kingdom has certain minimum rights that you cannot, and no government, can arbitrarily tread on.
[02:10:36.636 --> 02:10:43.543]  And one of those rights, which is mentioned specifically, is the right not to be arbitrarily moved against or imprisoned.
[02:10:43.543 --> 02:10:48.427]  It's mentioned several times in Magna Carta, without a proper public hearing.
[02:10:49.348 --> 02:10:52.730]  And what happened to Jason McGoldrick?
[02:10:52.730 --> 02:10:56.413]  An innocent, small businessman, wife and two kids then.
[02:10:56.413 --> 02:10:58.554]  He's got a third one now.
[02:10:58.554 --> 02:11:00.596]  He went to Hungary to try to set up a business.
[02:11:00.596 --> 02:11:02.477]  The business didn't succeed.
[02:11:02.477 --> 02:11:03.638]  It went under, owing $18,000.
[02:11:03.638 --> 02:11:11.683]  I mean, it wasn't a big amount of money, but not the kind of thing you could extradite somebody for, even if he defrauded somebody.
[02:11:12.163 --> 02:11:13.725]  Which, you know, he said he didn't.
[02:11:13.725 --> 02:11:15.426]  I can't tell you whether he did or he didn't.
[02:11:15.426 --> 02:11:17.388]  But that's not the point of the story.
[02:11:17.388 --> 02:11:25.155]  The point was no evidence whatsoever that he committed any crime was put before any court in the UK.
[02:11:25.155 --> 02:11:30.460]  And he went before one of the UK's best judges, Mr Justice Collins, the first solicitor.
[02:11:31.309 --> 02:11:53.410]  Ever to sit as a judge on the High Court, who reads everything, really cares about human rights, and Collins was horrified at being asked simply to rubber stamp a request by the Hungarian prosecutors that Jason McGoldrick, without even his family being told, should be shipped straight out to Hungary and locked away until he was tried for alleged fraud.
[02:11:54.492 --> 02:11:55.613]  And that's Napoleonic!
[02:11:55.613 --> 02:11:56.094]  That's Napoleonic!
[02:11:56.094 --> 02:11:57.435]  That's guilty until proven innocent!
[02:12:14.088 --> 02:12:29.172]  If not, it's worse than that, because at least the Juge d'Astruction, under the Napoleonic Code, that's the magistrate at first instance under our system, has the right, and indeed the duty, to ask questions.
[02:12:29.172 --> 02:12:36.754]  It's an interrogative rather than adversarial system, where the magistrate asks questions to find out whether there is at least a case.
[02:12:36.754 --> 02:12:38.694]  So it's even worse than, it's more like a
[02:12:39.094 --> 02:12:41.255]  We're not talking about a Napoleonic system.
[02:12:41.255 --> 02:12:43.075]  We're not talking about a British system.
[02:12:43.075 --> 02:12:45.876]  We are talking about a Soviet Communist system.
[02:12:45.876 --> 02:12:46.316]  Wow.
[02:12:46.316 --> 02:12:51.437]  Under which the accused has no rights at all to be heard.
[02:12:51.437 --> 02:12:55.698]  Habeas Corpus, Alex, in Britain is gone.
[02:12:55.698 --> 02:12:57.399]  And at a meeting just last night,
[02:12:58.540 --> 02:13:09.868]  Out in Largo Ward in Fife, which is quite well attended by local people, I said, I'm going to call Britain a police state and then ask how many of you think that that's overstating the case.
[02:13:09.868 --> 02:13:13.130]  And about 40% of them put their hands up and said they thought that was overstating it.
[02:13:13.949 --> 02:13:16.930]  Then I told them the story of Jason McEldrick.
[02:13:16.930 --> 02:13:24.272]  I said, the KGB, we call them the Serious Organised Crime Agency, they're one of the most hateful organisations in Britain.
[02:13:24.272 --> 02:13:28.673]  They kicked down his door at three in the morning, without any warning.
[02:13:28.673 --> 02:13:33.755]  They arrested him, they had him in front of Mr. Justice Collins in the High Court.
[02:13:34.691 --> 02:13:54.542]  In no time at all, Mr Justice Collins ordered him to be put on the plane and taken to Hungary, where he was locked up for four months without trial, without anyone having told him what he was accused of, without anyone allowing him access to a lawyer or the British Consul, without anyone telling his wife or children where he was, and he was fed.
[02:13:55.682 --> 02:14:11.919]  on rancid pork fat three times a day and he is still ill now as a result of this torture to which they subjected him without at any time having been ready to prosecute him because these, the very few rules
[02:14:12.519 --> 02:14:13.180]  We're good to go.
[02:14:34.773 --> 02:14:44.239]  William Dartmouth, my noble friend, the Earl of Dartmouth, a UKIP MEP, got him out of that prison when nobody else would help him, saying that they're still trying to find evidence against him.
[02:14:44.239 --> 02:14:46.760]  They haven't actually yet got a case against him.
[02:14:46.760 --> 02:14:53.124]  They've flagrantly abused the procedure, such as it is, of the arrest warrant.
[02:14:53.124 --> 02:14:55.926]  This is simply an arbitrary rendition.
[02:14:56.795 --> 02:15:09.844]  To a foreign country without any hearing, without any questions being asked as to whether this guy was guilty of anything, or whether they were even ready to say that he was guilty of anything, which we now know they weren't.
[02:15:09.844 --> 02:15:11.765]  We are no longer a free country.
[02:15:11.765 --> 02:15:19.570]  We are now a police state in the formal sense, in that you no longer have the rights that Magna Carta itself gave us.
[02:15:19.570 --> 02:15:22.632]  A right under which I was born, but under which I no longer live.
[02:15:24.309 --> 02:15:32.731]  That I should get a hearing in front of a judge before anybody locks me up, or fines me, or extradites me.
[02:15:32.731 --> 02:15:34.792]  That right has gone.
[02:15:34.792 --> 02:15:38.773]  Unbelievable, and I want to expand on that because that is the most fundamental right.
[02:15:38.773 --> 02:15:48.816]  And this has happened in every culture where you have absolute rule by a despot, a king, an oligarchy, a dictator, is they can say, seize that...
[02:15:50.390 --> 02:15:52.431]  Here's the nasty bit.
[02:15:52.431 --> 02:15:56.112]  Jason McGoldrick, originally, you know, he wasn't a UKIP member.
[02:15:56.112 --> 02:15:57.833]  He was a member of the Conservative Party.
[02:15:57.833 --> 02:16:03.955]  He wrote to his Conservative member of the European Parliament and he said, look, I have been arbitrarily arrested.
[02:16:03.955 --> 02:16:05.515]  I haven't been told why.
[02:16:05.515 --> 02:16:07.256]  I've been locked up for four months.
[02:16:07.256 --> 02:16:07.936]  I'm very sick.
[02:16:07.936 --> 02:16:10.877]  I've been poisoned with this ghastly pork fat.
[02:16:10.877 --> 02:16:15.419]  And I am desperate for my family to know where I am.
[02:16:15.419 --> 02:16:17.660]  I want to get this sorted out.
[02:16:17.660 --> 02:16:18.480]  Will you please help?
[02:16:19.040 --> 02:16:30.884]  And this was the reply he got from a so-called conservative, and now you will know, Alex, why I no longer am a member of the Conservative Party, because this is the kind of people they now have as their representatives.
[02:16:30.884 --> 02:16:39.046]  This man wrote back to him and said, if a foreign government says that you're guilty of a serious crime, that's enough for me.
[02:16:39.046 --> 02:16:41.207]  There is no need for a trial anymore.
[02:16:41.207 --> 02:16:44.908]  If they say you're guilty, you're guilty, and serve your sentence like a man.
[02:16:44.908 --> 02:16:46.669]  Of course, he hadn't been charged with anything.
[02:16:47.089 --> 02:16:52.470]  He was just locked up at the whim of some minor communist official in Hungary.
[02:16:52.470 --> 02:16:54.291]  This is the essence of tyranny.
[02:16:54.291 --> 02:16:55.451]  This is the essence of tyranny.
[02:16:55.451 --> 02:16:56.331]  And here's my point.
[02:16:56.331 --> 02:17:04.293]  Then he gets in touch with a member of the UK Independence Party from England, part of the EU Parliament, to show how tyrannical it is.
[02:17:04.293 --> 02:17:07.194]  When the authority figure showed up, they just released him.
[02:17:07.674 --> 02:17:25.109]  In a true republic, he would have been charged, and a member of parliament couldn't just do an on-the-spot pardon, so that prima facie shows the tyranny that they just grabbed him, were holding him, not charging him, and the conservative representative ignored it.
[02:17:25.109 --> 02:17:35.298]  The UK Independence Party person went, and the communist thugs, part of the EU, groveled to his authority and released him, showing that it was completely arbitrary.
[02:17:36.147 --> 02:17:39.916]  And the way they released him was very characteristic of the Communists.
[02:17:39.916 --> 02:17:43.143]  They just opened the door of the jail one day and booted him out.
[02:17:44.386 --> 02:17:48.208]  There was no prior warning they were going to do this.
[02:17:48.208 --> 02:17:55.872]  Of course, the MEP, William Dartmouth, was on the phone every day to them telling them they've got to do this.
[02:17:55.872 --> 02:17:58.513]  They just boosted him out the door and slammed it and left him on the street.
[02:17:58.513 --> 02:18:02.615]  No money, no telephone, no way of getting in touch with anybody.
[02:18:02.615 --> 02:18:09.078]  And he had to go and beg until he could get somebody to let him have a phone so he could bring home and get some money so he could be flown back.
[02:18:10.759 --> 02:18:11.079]  I think.
[02:18:26.288 --> 02:18:26.508]  I don't
[02:18:42.015 --> 02:18:43.616]  UKIP will win its point.
[02:18:43.616 --> 02:19:04.205]  We will come out of the European Union, which is not just anti-democratic, it's irreformably anti-democratic, and we will once again be the masters of our own destiny and never again will a British citizen be arbitrarily have his door kicked in at three in the morning and whisked off and put on a plane and locked up in some dank, miserable communist dungeon somewhere
[02:19:04.625 --> 02:19:12.574]  Just on the say-so of a communist official and without the slightest right to be heard or even to know what it was.
[02:19:12.574 --> 02:19:15.918]  To this day he doesn't know what it was that he was accused of.
[02:19:15.918 --> 02:19:17.560]  And I can tell you what I'm going to do about it.
[02:19:19.462 --> 02:19:20.062]  Yeah, I'll do that.
[02:19:49.903 --> 02:19:55.374]  The Congress won't pass the carbon taxes he implements by fiat and seizes the power plants.
[02:19:55.374 --> 02:19:56.596]  This is tyrannous.
[02:19:56.596 --> 02:19:57.698]  This is tyranny.
[02:19:57.698 --> 02:19:58.359]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:01.994 --> 02:20:02.494]  The U.S.
[02:20:02.494 --> 02:20:04.516]  economy is at a tipping point.
[02:20:04.516 --> 02:20:07.619]  Forty cents of every dollar the government spends is borrowed.
[02:20:07.619 --> 02:20:16.387]  The president of the Federal Reserve in Dallas was recently quoted saying, this path will lead to insolvency, resulting in the collapse of our government and our economy.
[02:20:16.387 --> 02:20:19.450]  Our country can't function like this, and neither can your household.
[02:20:19.810 --> 02:20:23.552]  That's why you need to prepare and priority one is your food supply.
[02:20:23.552 --> 02:20:27.413]  Fortunately, it's easy and affordable with the help of Ready Reserve Foods.

[02:22:02.944 --> 02:22:05.427]  Urgent if you care about feeding your family.
[02:22:05.427 --> 02:22:10.150]  S-510 has passed through Congress and will make the sale of heirloom seeds difficult.
[02:22:10.150 --> 02:22:15.995]  Prices of non-GMO seeds are skyrocketing and may be hard to afford in the future, if you can even find them.
[02:22:15.995 --> 02:22:22.781]  As the economy continues to decline, this will make the heirloom seeds worth their weight in gold and one of the best barter tools available.
[02:22:22.781 --> 02:22:27.325]  When food supplies eventually run out, your solution is to grow your own food and barter tool.
[02:22:27.765 --> 02:22:35.270]  Now, for a short time, GetSeeds.net offers 100 packets of heirloom non-GMO vegetable seeds for only $59.

[02:22:38.752 --> 02:22:41.574]  The best price on the net for high quality seeds.

[02:23:00.387 --> 02:23:01.688]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:23:01.688 --> 02:23:07.294]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:23:07.294 --> 02:23:12.299]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:23:12.299 --> 02:23:17.884]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:23:17.884 --> 02:23:19.706]  So our friends at Solutions from Science
[02:23:19.966 --> 02:23:20.466]  We're good to go.
[02:23:38.018 --> 02:23:41.202]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:23:41.202 --> 02:23:43.424]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[02:23:44.365 --> 02:23:44.765]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:23:44.765 --> 02:23:48.009]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:23:48.009 --> 02:23:49.771]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:24:04.568 --> 02:24:07.589]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[02:24:07.589 --> 02:24:15.171]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:24:15.171 --> 02:24:17.192]  Okay, my friends, Lord Monckton is our guest.
[02:24:17.192 --> 02:24:19.333]  He was pointing out what he's going to do about it.
[02:24:19.333 --> 02:24:25.675]  Imagine, foreign, incredibly corrupt governments that get away with whatever they want, the EU backs it.
[02:24:26.582 --> 02:24:33.207]  Order the British police, and they use this federal commissariat, to come grab you in the middle of the night.
[02:24:33.207 --> 02:24:35.968]  Only the worst regimes in history did that.
[02:24:35.968 --> 02:24:37.229]  The terror comes at night.
[02:24:37.229 --> 02:24:46.496]  Normally the police pick you up at work, pick you up at, you know, when you're walking out to get in your car in the morning, they just walk up, soft power, here's the warrant, police car.
[02:24:47.276 --> 02:24:50.117]  Only the secret police in black uniforms kicked down doors.
[02:24:50.117 --> 02:24:51.437]  The NKVD.
[02:24:51.437 --> 02:24:55.058]  Notice how our whole culture worldwide is shifting to this.
[02:24:55.058 --> 02:24:56.858]  This is done scientifically.
[02:24:56.858 --> 02:25:09.602]  Lord Mocton, what are you, the former head of the UK Independence Party, and of course really their omnibudsman, now running for office for the Parliament there in Scotland, what are you doing to strike a blow?
[02:25:09.602 --> 02:25:10.142]  Because you said 40%
[02:25:11.602 --> 02:25:13.503]  Didn't think Britain was a police state.
[02:25:13.503 --> 02:25:14.184]  Sixty did.
[02:25:14.184 --> 02:25:16.745]  You know, a large group of citizens.
[02:25:16.745 --> 02:25:20.247]  And then after the story, 100% understood when you broke it down.
[02:25:20.247 --> 02:25:21.128]  What is your battle plan?
[02:25:21.128 --> 02:25:35.056]  The battle plan, stage one, is that once this campaign is over, I will be writing an amicus curiae brief to the judge in the case, telling him, A, that Jason McGoldrick was tortured while he was in prison.
[02:25:36.128 --> 02:25:40.011]  By being starved and fed this ghastly, rancid pork fat three times a day.
[02:25:40.011 --> 02:25:40.611]  And nothing else!
[02:25:40.611 --> 02:25:42.072]  No vegetables, no potatoes, nothing.
[02:25:42.072 --> 02:25:43.253]  Just pork fat.
[02:25:43.253 --> 02:25:43.974]  Three times a day.
[02:25:43.974 --> 02:26:04.208]  And B, that the prosecutor effectively lied to the British Court by presenting the application for a warrant at a time when there is a presumption that he was ready to try Mr. McGoldrick, but in fact he clearly wasn't, as we can prove from documents that have come to light since.
[02:26:05.100 --> 02:26:07.703]  So I'm going to tell the judge those two things.
[02:26:07.703 --> 02:26:23.139]  I'm going to say you are not allowed to inquire at the moment when the warrant is demanded into any of its circumstances, but once you are told that the warrant was improperly demanded, and we can prove that with documents from Hungary,
[02:26:23.923 --> 02:26:43.068]  And once you are told that this regime imprisoned this man in conditions which were inhumane and constituting in UK law torture, contrary to section 177 of the Criminal Justice Act 1983, that is something of which the judge cannot but take judicial notice.
[02:26:43.068 --> 02:26:52.950]  He will have to call the Hungarian authorities in front of him in court, where I will be putting down a motion that the Hungarian foreign minister
[02:26:53.650 --> 02:26:54.231]  We're good to go.
[02:27:10.051 --> 02:27:16.834]  And by the way, you and your investigations have sent a lot of people to prison and derailed a lot of criminal actions.
[02:27:16.834 --> 02:27:25.819]  You're not playing games, Lord Monckton, so more power to you because official oppression, the power of a criminal judiciary outside of any law,
[02:27:26.519 --> 02:27:37.604]  We'll reduce us down to classical absolute tyranny and we all must stand together so that free people do not become slaves of this bureaucracy.
[02:27:37.604 --> 02:27:39.265]  We only have two minutes left.
[02:27:39.265 --> 02:27:46.648]  Give us a breakdown of the globalist ongoing programs to seize control of the global energy system.
[02:27:47.779 --> 02:27:53.301]  Well, they're still going on and on and on and on about this global warming nonsense, but it's failing.
[02:27:53.301 --> 02:27:59.724]  We've now had no, and I mean no, global warming for ten long years.
[02:27:59.724 --> 02:28:07.607]  There was supposed to be 0.5 Fahrenheit of global warming over the last ten years, according to the UN's climate panel.
[02:28:08.247 --> 02:28:09.587]  It hasn't happened.
[02:28:09.587 --> 02:28:10.848]  It isn't happening.
[02:28:10.848 --> 02:28:12.268]  And it's now very, very clear.
[02:28:12.268 --> 02:28:16.189]  I've just been studying the record for the last 60 years, changes in greenhouse gases.
[02:28:16.189 --> 02:28:19.670]  We've been getting the latest data, putting it in the computer.
[02:28:19.670 --> 02:28:25.791]  It's absolutely clear that this is not happening at anything like the rate they predicted.
[02:28:25.791 --> 02:28:34.293]  But the other thing that we've now done, we're working with international scientists and economists, is we worked out just how little difference it makes.
[02:28:35.113 --> 02:28:43.581]  If you, for instance, have a Waxman-Markey climate bill, and that would cut down 5-6 of the U.S.
[02:28:43.581 --> 02:28:45.423]  carbon economy over the next 40 years.
[02:28:45.423 --> 02:28:47.224]  That figure was in the bill, 83%.
[02:28:47.224 --> 02:28:49.126]  5-6 would have been shut down.
[02:28:49.126 --> 02:28:57.033]  And that, over 40 years, would have reduced global temperature by 0.09 Celsius.
[02:28:57.033 --> 02:28:59.936]  It would have made hardly any difference, and it would have cost
[02:29:00.776 --> 02:29:03.018]  7.2 trillion dollars.
[02:29:03.018 --> 02:29:06.862]  That's how absurd all of this is, economically speaking.
[02:29:06.862 --> 02:29:09.304]  And we're about to publish these results worldwide.
[02:29:09.304 --> 02:29:14.088]  It's going to take a few more weeks to get them peer-reviewed and into the literature, but we're very close to it now.
[02:29:14.088 --> 02:29:23.876]  And when everybody sees just how little your trillions buy when you're trying to stop the temperature rising, then they're just going to laugh this whole nonsense out of court.
[02:29:23.876 --> 02:29:28.060]  And when they do, then this world government network will suffer
[02:29:39.325 --> 02:29:40.046]  Absolutely.
[02:29:40.046 --> 02:29:42.847]  Lord Monckton, you've been very gracious.
[02:29:42.847 --> 02:29:43.687]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:29:43.687 --> 02:29:47.109]  Alright, there goes Lord Christopher Monckton.
[02:29:47.109 --> 02:29:48.090]  Sorry to have to cut him off.
[02:29:48.090 --> 02:29:51.571]  We'll be right back with Steve Watson.
[02:29:51.571 --> 02:29:52.972]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.972 --> 02:29:54.493]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.510 --> 02:30:01.592]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.592 --> 02:30:08.535]  Over the last year, Alex has told you about and many of you have experienced emergencies and disasters in unprecedented numbers.
[02:30:08.535 --> 02:30:11.176]  People have had to literally run for their lives.
[02:30:11.176 --> 02:30:13.617]  Folks, this is Steve Schenck with eFoods Direct.
[02:30:13.617 --> 02:30:17.998]  I'm not here to scare you, but when disaster strikes, you won't have time to think.
[02:30:17.998 --> 02:30:19.479]  You must act automatically.
[02:30:19.699 --> 02:30:23.201]  What does a pilot do when the helicopter engine fails in flight?
[02:30:23.201 --> 02:30:25.982]  No time to think, just act automatically.
[02:30:25.982 --> 02:30:34.326]  When the alert is broadcast, the alarm sounds, or the knock comes on your door, you'll need to be ready to act without thinking of what to do or what you need.
[02:30:34.326 --> 02:30:37.107]  You need a 5-Day Extreme Emergency Kit.
[02:30:37.367 --> 02:30:47.056]  With serious supplies and real food to secure two adults for five days, this powerful $300 Extreme Emergency Kit is free with an order of at least $995 from eFoodsDirect.
[02:30:47.056 --> 02:30:49.137]  Go to eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex or call 800-409-5633.
[02:30:49.137 --> 02:30:51.580]  That's eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex, 800-409-5633.
[02:30:51.580 --> 02:30:52.280]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:31:02.369 --> 02:31:02.889]  I don't think so.
[02:31:22.495 --> 02:31:28.740]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:31:28.740 --> 02:31:32.123]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:31:32.123 --> 02:31:37.908]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:31:37.908 --> 02:31:39.549]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:31:39.549 --> 02:31:40.850]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:31:40.850 --> 02:31:43.533]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:31:43.533 --> 02:31:44.934]  He explains everything you need to know.
[02:31:45.194 --> 02:31:47.737]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:31:47.737 --> 02:31:52.362]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:31:52.362 --> 02:31:54.945]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[02:31:58.829 --> 02:31:59.830]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:32:00.811 --> 02:32:04.993]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:32:04.993 --> 02:32:11.415]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:32:11.415 --> 02:32:18.798]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:32:18.798 --> 02:32:23.659]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[02:32:28.621 --> 02:32:32.362]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[02:32:32.362 --> 02:32:34.643]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[02:32:34.643 --> 02:32:34.983]  Call us!

[02:32:53.616 --> 02:32:54.417]  Thank you!
[02:33:07.617 --> 02:33:13.161]  Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you.
[02:33:13.161 --> 02:33:17.284]  By now you should have somehow realized what you gotta do.
[02:33:17.284 --> 02:33:24.270]  I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now.
[02:33:30.692 --> 02:33:41.320]  You know, I was just going to have Lord Monckton on for 30 minutes, but then he started getting into the UK being under the EU arrest warrant system.
[02:33:41.320 --> 02:33:45.562]  And under this UN global system, dictatorships can have you arrested.
[02:33:45.562 --> 02:33:47.664]  And it's going on.
[02:33:47.664 --> 02:33:49.745]  It's happening.
[02:33:49.745 --> 02:33:53.688]  And torture is condoned.
[02:33:53.688 --> 02:33:54.209]  All of this.
[02:33:55.308 --> 02:34:03.599]  And I go back to what I was discussing earlier in the first hour with the confirmed.
[02:34:03.599 --> 02:34:12.331]  I mean the state police in Michigan, but it's also going on other areas of the country, have wireless systems that hack into your phone as you drive by and in seconds
[02:34:12.892 --> 02:34:13.932]  Because they have the back door.
[02:34:13.932 --> 02:34:27.077]  Download your user history, your photos, your passcodes, your directory, and now when they pull you over for speeding, whatever, they grab your phone, plug it in, and steal everything off of it.
[02:34:27.077 --> 02:34:30.759]  The TSA is now doing that to more and more people with their laptops and phones.
[02:34:30.759 --> 02:34:35.140]  Sometimes, though, they're busy, so they just take them and say, we'll send it to you in a few months.
[02:34:35.140 --> 02:34:37.381]  In some cases, you get them a few months later.
[02:34:37.381 --> 02:34:39.702]  I mean, this is off-the-charts tyranny.
[02:34:40.735 --> 02:34:45.658]  And it's going on everywhere in our society.
[02:34:45.658 --> 02:34:47.759]  And I just hope people realize this is happening.
[02:34:47.759 --> 02:34:55.443]  You know, last Friday we shot a video, then we edited it this week and just put it up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:34:55.443 --> 02:35:03.227]  The title of the video is, Censored Video, Alex Jones Joins the New World Order.
[02:35:04.987 --> 02:35:18.327]  And it is rated, just being up since late last night, 16 most viewed today news and politics, 11 top favorited news and politics, number 7 top rated news and politics, number 28 top rated this week news and politics.
[02:35:18.327 --> 02:35:20.790]  That means it'll go to number one unless they start trying to block it.
[02:35:21.371 --> 02:35:23.212]  And it only says 4,173 hits.
[02:35:23.212 --> 02:35:26.595]  That's because that's what it probably got in the first hour.
[02:35:26.595 --> 02:35:28.356]  It just updates late.
[02:35:28.356 --> 02:35:30.818]  It'll probably be 100,000 next time it updates.
[02:35:30.818 --> 02:35:32.099]  Get this video out to everybody.
[02:35:32.099 --> 02:35:34.120]  But what's funny is I knew this would happen.
[02:35:34.120 --> 02:35:36.622]  It says it's satire.
[02:35:36.622 --> 02:35:41.005]  It says it's a joke illustrating the absurdity of what's happening in our society.
[02:35:42.376 --> 02:35:46.559]  And still a bunch of people think it's real and are freaking out right now.
[02:35:46.559 --> 02:35:47.660]  And I'm not going to play it on air.
[02:35:47.660 --> 02:35:49.982]  You got to go watch it if you want to find out after the show.
[02:35:49.982 --> 02:35:51.843]  It's up at Infowars.com.
[02:35:51.843 --> 02:35:55.226]  But it looks extreme.
[02:35:55.226 --> 02:35:57.348]  It looks hardcore.
[02:36:00.449 --> 02:36:09.333]  It seems absurd what goes on in this video, but it turns out, you gotta go watch it, that it's actually less extreme than what's really going on.
[02:36:09.333 --> 02:36:15.796]  The government banning dodgeball at state and federal level all across the country, now going into private schools saying they can't.
[02:36:15.796 --> 02:36:21.639]  Kickball, softball, the government not letting parents pack lunches for their children, saying you can't be trusted.
[02:36:21.639 --> 02:36:24.140]  TSA sticking their hands down your pants.
[02:36:24.140 --> 02:36:27.261]  The government stealing your wireless transmissions.
[02:36:27.261 --> 02:36:28.342]  This is all going on.
[02:36:30.353 --> 02:36:43.499]  This just helped me remember that I briefly had the idea earlier in the last hour, and I only mentioned it once, so we may not be successful today, to do a Google search term today.
[02:36:43.499 --> 02:36:46.901]  Now, we've been successful over 70 times.
[02:36:46.901 --> 02:36:49.262]  A couple times we haven't hit number one.
[02:36:49.262 --> 02:36:51.323]  We're unable to search TSA terms.
[02:36:51.323 --> 02:36:53.484]  Those are definitely blocked.
[02:36:53.484 --> 02:36:55.985]  Terms critical to TSA, those are blocked.
[02:36:56.738 --> 02:36:59.463]  We did a test last week twice, and they're definitely blocking it.
[02:36:59.463 --> 02:37:02.449]  Then we did Alex Jones, it went to number one.
[02:37:02.449 --> 02:37:04.493]  Today, we're gonna do this.
[02:37:04.493 --> 02:37:07.178]  Cops steal cell phone.
[02:37:07.178 --> 02:37:08.681]  That's three words out of our article.
[02:37:09.673 --> 02:37:15.414]  Cops use mobile scanner to steal cell phone data from innocent Americans without warrants.
[02:37:15.414 --> 02:37:19.355]  That's our article at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:37:19.355 --> 02:37:28.998]  So everybody, I don't like doing this in the 11th hour here with only 25 minutes left, but I want to search the term right now, cops steal cell phone.
[02:37:28.998 --> 02:37:30.078]  Let's do it, three words.
[02:37:30.078 --> 02:37:33.699]  Put it in Google, hit click, enter it 50, 60 times.
[02:37:33.699 --> 02:37:34.539]  It's easy to do.
[02:37:34.539 --> 02:37:35.780]  It'll send it to number one.
[02:37:35.780 --> 02:37:36.340]  Let's do it.
[02:37:37.020 --> 02:37:40.021]  Cops steal cell phone.
[02:37:40.021 --> 02:37:48.906]  And now the cops are going after the ACLU with hundreds of thousands of dollars of attempted fines for even FOIA requesting this.
[02:37:48.906 --> 02:37:51.507]  Now you FOIA request the documents, they say, yeah, that'll cost $500,000.
[02:37:51.507 --> 02:37:55.008]  And you requested it, you gotta pay it.
[02:37:55.008 --> 02:37:58.030]  Oh, you wanted to have a demonstration at your church that was unpopular?
[02:37:58.030 --> 02:37:59.511]  We had to send out cops for security?
[02:37:59.511 --> 02:38:00.771]  Well, I didn't want your security.
[02:38:00.771 --> 02:38:03.192]  Sorry, you owe us half a million.
[02:38:03.192 --> 02:38:04.453]  Like with the Koran-burning preacher.
[02:38:06.052 --> 02:38:07.953]  This is how they're doing it.
[02:38:07.953 --> 02:38:15.196]  So cops steal cell phone, that'll lead folks to the article, cops use mobile scanner to steal cell phone data from innocent Americans.
[02:38:15.196 --> 02:38:20.357]  I mean, your whole data list, they hack in, the phones are built for them to do this, and it's going on all over the country.
[02:38:20.357 --> 02:38:24.159]  I've been told by police sources in Austin that they're doing this in Austin.
[02:38:24.159 --> 02:38:26.520]  Most cops don't know about it, it's special units that have it.
[02:38:28.581 --> 02:38:30.102]  This is just incredible.
[02:38:30.102 --> 02:38:38.145]  Now, shifting gears for the rest of the hour, we'll probably do five minutes of overdrive or so, so we have a full 30-minute interview with Steve Watson.
[02:38:38.145 --> 02:38:44.988]  Steve Watson joining us from the United Kingdom is, of course, Paul Watson's brother.
[02:38:44.988 --> 02:38:48.329]  He has a master's degree in political science.
[02:38:48.329 --> 02:38:51.950]  Both of them are great writers, very intelligent people.
[02:38:51.950 --> 02:38:55.832]  And Watson, his brother, Paul's been working with me for nine years.
[02:38:55.832 --> 02:38:57.813]  Steve, I believe it's for about eight now.
[02:38:58.693 --> 02:39:26.133]  And they just do an exemplary job at PrisonPlanet.tv, PrisonPlanet.com, and Steve Watson joins us to give us his take on the fact that it's now admitted that the West has financed all these rebellions in the Middle East, Central Asia, now even the LA Times is admitting that, and they're calling bombs being dropped, humanitarian and non-military, and ground troops that were there from the start, now publicly there, thousands more landing,
[02:39:26.573 --> 02:39:28.395]  British U.S.E.U.
[02:39:28.395 --> 02:39:33.759]  as they move forward for the open announcement of ground war, calling it a peacekeeping force.
[02:39:33.759 --> 02:39:34.860]  See, this is all U.N.
[02:39:34.860 --> 02:39:36.581]  nomenclature.
[02:39:36.581 --> 02:39:42.847]  And if anyone resists them when they're backing the rebels that are attacking Gaddafi's forces, the government forces, they're going to be called terrorists.
[02:39:42.847 --> 02:39:44.148]  We're going to talk about that.
[02:39:44.148 --> 02:39:49.773]  And then I want to get into Royal Wedding Street Party for Republicans is banned by
[02:39:51.131 --> 02:39:51.191]  Yes.
[02:40:12.669 --> 02:40:13.770]  Howdy Alex, how you doing?
[02:40:13.770 --> 02:40:16.132]  Yeah, I'm thinking about wearing it for the Royal Wedding.
[02:40:16.132 --> 02:40:17.353]  When I go out on the street.
[02:40:35.526 --> 02:40:53.798]  Hey Steve, tell us about the little story when we visited the tower and we're seeing the royal jewels and there were some Brits in there worshipping the royal German family, the Saxe-Coburg-Gothas, like Americans worship Obama, and we had a little argument with them, didn't we?
[02:40:55.097 --> 02:40:56.858]  That's right, yeah.
[02:40:56.858 --> 02:41:07.967]  Quite a while ago now, we went to the Tower of London where they like to parade their various different torture devices throughout the years.
[02:41:07.967 --> 02:41:22.058]  And we were walking around looking at the projected videos of the Queen's coronation on the walls, looking at the various jewels that they display for the public.
[02:41:22.058 --> 02:41:22.258]  And then
[02:41:24.673 --> 02:41:39.220]  You know, we kind of expressed a bit of disgust at it all, as we do, and this lady behind us overheard us and said, How dare you criticise your culture!
[02:41:40.205 --> 02:41:44.208]  To which we replied, well, this isn't really our culture, is it?
[02:41:44.208 --> 02:41:46.390]  This is a culture of days gone by.
[02:41:46.390 --> 02:42:01.582]  I mean, call me a wild-eyed radical progressive, but I don't think our head of state should be selected based on whether they came out of the womb of someone who wears a crown and lives in a palace.
[02:42:02.777 --> 02:42:03.458]  Absolutely.
[02:42:03.458 --> 02:42:17.108]  And then meanwhile, the royal family you have is from the continental Saxe-Coburg Gothas that hundreds of years before usurped England, invaded England and took the place over.
[02:42:17.748 --> 02:42:19.948]  I mean, go all the way back to William the Conqueror.
[02:42:19.948 --> 02:42:21.289]  I mean, this is a joke.
[02:42:21.289 --> 02:42:26.450]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, this is like pygmies with bones in their noses and headdresses.
[02:42:26.450 --> 02:42:37.472]  You've got some swollen old decadent crone up there who just neutralized for the third time in three years the Canadian Parliament because they didn't want to follow her orders.
[02:42:37.472 --> 02:42:41.313]  The truth is they run all this PR how they're powerless and have no power.
[02:42:42.353 --> 02:42:54.499]  When I've been in England they shut down half the roads in London randomly to let you know she owns the roads and on the tour bus they told us you were arrested in England if you talk bad about the Queen.
[02:42:54.499 --> 02:43:04.645]  Yeah that's right, I mean that's the argument that we hear over and over again that the Royal Family is irrelevant, it's purely ceremonial, has no power.
[02:43:05.632 --> 02:43:08.253]  Well, if that's the case, get rid of it then.
[02:43:08.253 --> 02:43:08.933]  Abolish it.
[02:43:08.933 --> 02:43:14.215]  Because we're still paying, you know, billions in taxpayer money into this all the time.
[02:43:14.215 --> 02:43:24.338]  Abolish it, get rid of it, put the money into, I don't know, put it into education, put it into hospitals, do something with it, because if it's purely ceremonial then we don't need it, do we?
[02:43:25.509 --> 02:43:26.069]  No, we don't.
[02:43:26.069 --> 02:43:28.190]  In fact, we can search this and put it on screen.
[02:43:28.190 --> 02:43:46.738]  Last year, as tens of thousands of elderly were literally on the verge of freezing to death and having to ride on buses 24 hours a day to stay warm, having their welfare stipend for natural gas cut, it turned out that all the Queen's dozens of huge palaces were being heated off of the heating welfare
[02:43:47.398 --> 02:43:49.759]  Yeah, I thought you might like it, so I put it there.
[02:43:49.759 --> 02:43:51.539]  I'm gearing up for the Royal Wedding.
[02:43:51.539 --> 02:43:54.379]  I'm gonna get out there on the streets.
[02:43:54.379 --> 02:43:55.340]  Well, I won't be allowed.
[02:43:55.340 --> 02:43:55.640]  It's banned.
[02:44:17.199 --> 02:44:17.699]  That's right.
[02:44:17.699 --> 02:44:18.580]  In fact, it's in the news.
[02:44:18.580 --> 02:44:27.665]  They're saying if you dare speak in any way wrong of the royal personages, you will be instantly seized because England is so free!
[02:44:29.500 --> 02:44:30.261]  That's right.
[02:44:30.261 --> 02:44:37.887]  I mean, right, what's happening is, for those that don't know, this is next week, next Friday, the Royal Wedding.
[02:44:37.887 --> 02:44:45.293]  Wills, good old Wills and Kate are getting married, right, so everyone in the country has got the day off.
[02:44:45.293 --> 02:44:53.499]  And what they've got to do is get out into the streets, have a big table set up with lots of nice cupcakes with their faces on and stuff like that, and that's all great.
[02:44:53.499 --> 02:44:55.260]  The Prime Minister says we've got to go and do that.
[02:44:57.363 --> 02:45:03.586]  There's a few people in this country that don't really agree with having a monarchy anymore.
[02:45:03.586 --> 02:45:15.352]  And they've expressed the opinion that they'd like to have, you know, a little, sort of, not a celebration, just a little party of their own to just say, you know, we don't really support this.
[02:45:15.352 --> 02:45:22.156]  But it turns out that they're not going to be allowed to do that because the local councils are banning it.
[02:45:22.156 --> 02:45:23.757]  And let me read a quote for you from
[02:45:25.407 --> 02:45:27.048]  From a news article about this.
[02:45:27.048 --> 02:45:29.269]  It was a group called Republic.
[02:45:29.269 --> 02:45:33.671]  Obviously, in the traditional sense of the word, they're Republicans in this country.
[02:45:33.671 --> 02:45:35.391]  They don't believe in a monarchy.
[02:45:35.391 --> 02:45:43.755]  They wanted to have a party, but they applied to the council to just make it all legit and everything.
[02:45:43.755 --> 02:45:51.418]  The council replied back saying that they couldn't have a party because they'd failed to provide an adequate management plan.
[02:45:51.418 --> 02:45:52.179]  Which is, you know,
[02:45:53.511 --> 02:45:55.373]  That's what we really need to do.
[02:46:14.980 --> 02:46:21.988]  Well, yeah, they've already banned protests around the most politically sensitive areas of London.
[02:46:21.988 --> 02:46:30.177]  You can't hold a protest without first applying to Westminster Council and stating what your protest is going to be about.
[02:46:31.378 --> 02:46:36.041]  How many people are going to be there, etc, etc, for anything at all.
[02:46:36.041 --> 02:46:46.586]  You know, there was someone who was famously arrested for reading out the names of soldiers that had been killed in Iraq from a newspaper that it was printed in that day.
[02:46:46.586 --> 02:46:48.687]  They were arrested straight away.
[02:46:48.687 --> 02:46:50.008]  And that's the kind of thing that goes on.
[02:46:50.008 --> 02:46:52.109]  But let me read this quote about the royal parties.
[02:46:52.109 --> 02:46:57.571]  Because this is what the council wrote back to the group Republic.
[02:46:57.571 --> 02:46:58.092]  Oh, of course.
[02:46:59.642 --> 02:47:06.327]  We do not consider this event to be a community festival stroke party.
[02:47:06.327 --> 02:47:13.172]  The purpose of such is to draw the community together in an act of celebration stroke oneness.
[02:47:13.172 --> 02:47:20.198]  It's very likely that this event is not or would not be supported by the majority of the community.
[02:47:20.198 --> 02:47:23.560]  Indeed, it does not serve to engage the community in any way.
[02:47:24.733 --> 02:47:32.017]  So that's why you can't hold a Republican... What an arrogant... Read me the mainstream headline out of that.
[02:47:32.017 --> 02:47:37.039]  What an arrogant thing saying the... I mean, just throwing it in your face.
[02:47:37.039 --> 02:47:37.800]  The headline is...
[02:47:39.770 --> 02:47:43.993]  Not the Royal Wedding Street Party banned by Camden Council.
[02:47:43.993 --> 02:47:45.675]  Alright, now let's expand on that.
[02:47:45.675 --> 02:47:49.157]  You're wearing, the answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:47:49.157 --> 02:47:50.558]  You're in Airstrip 1.
[02:47:50.558 --> 02:47:58.484]  A lot of people are like, why is this British guy, that's like a Dallas cowboy who lives in Dallas, you know, wearing a red skin shirt.
[02:47:58.484 --> 02:48:04.409]  The truth is, if you study history, the Parliament didn't vote to have war with the other British citizens, the colonists.
[02:48:04.929 --> 02:48:08.710]  And then the King had to ride in and give a rare speech, King George III.
[02:48:08.710 --> 02:48:11.791]  And he wasn't liked, by the way, because he was, you know, could hardly even speak English.
[02:48:11.791 --> 02:48:13.211]  He was so German.
[02:48:13.211 --> 02:48:15.392]  And they got upset about that.
[02:48:15.392 --> 02:48:18.433]  But he demanded they do it, so they went ahead with the war.
[02:48:18.433 --> 02:48:21.914]  And so people think that it was the British hating America.
[02:48:21.914 --> 02:48:26.595]  The United States colonies were predominantly British, and of course were British-ruled.
[02:48:26.595 --> 02:48:30.396]  And so we need to have the spirit of 1776 over there.
[02:48:30.396 --> 02:48:34.177]  I think we should launch an operation against this tyranny, and everybody should
[02:48:34.537 --> 02:48:42.626]  Hang up, the answer to 1984 is 1776, or just wear 1776 shirts, 1776 signs.
[02:48:42.626 --> 02:48:46.090]  I mean, who says the Brits can't continue what we did?
[02:48:46.090 --> 02:48:51.416]  I mean, absolutely, let's run them back to the continent of Europe, and they don't want them there either.
[02:48:51.416 --> 02:48:53.638]  Let's run them back to their German castles.
[02:48:53.638 --> 02:48:54.599]  What do you say, Paul?
[02:48:54.599 --> 02:48:54.740]  Steve?
[02:48:57.017 --> 02:48:58.097]  Well, I mean, that's right.
[02:48:58.097 --> 02:49:01.719]  You sound nothing like your brother, but I hardly ever interview you, so I keep saying Paul.
[02:49:01.719 --> 02:49:04.140]  I'm much better looking as well.
[02:49:04.140 --> 02:49:05.220]  Go ahead.
[02:49:05.220 --> 02:49:06.780]  Go ahead, Paul.
[02:49:06.780 --> 02:49:07.441]  Steve.
[02:49:07.441 --> 02:49:08.321]  Paul, Steve.
[02:49:08.321 --> 02:49:09.101]  Steve Watson joins us.
[02:49:09.101 --> 02:49:09.761]  Go ahead.
[02:49:09.761 --> 02:49:16.024]  Look, in this country, there's a massive amount of people that are against the monarchy.
[02:49:16.024 --> 02:49:22.726]  And it was only a few years ago that there were TV debates and, you know, public votes about abolishing it altogether.
[02:49:23.447 --> 02:49:35.044]  Yeah, now we're in a situation where next Friday we're expected to line the streets and have parades and stuff and I don't know why all of this has been forgotten so quickly.
[02:49:35.044 --> 02:49:37.888]  I mean, like you said, they're not...
[02:49:39.215 --> 02:49:40.836]  They're not even English.
[02:49:40.836 --> 02:49:43.598]  Let's not mention the fact that they're German.
[02:49:43.598 --> 02:49:49.983]  They changed their name to the House of Windsor to sound more English at the beginning of the 20th century.
[02:49:49.983 --> 02:49:51.204]  George V did, so.
[02:49:51.204 --> 02:49:56.968]  I mean, there's a massive movement in this country to just get rid of them.
[02:49:56.968 --> 02:49:59.810]  Well, why can't I come there and be the king of England?
[02:49:59.810 --> 02:50:05.895]  I mean, I'm more, more, you know, Britannic, you know, Jones, than the Gothas.
[02:50:05.895 --> 02:50:06.996]  Can I come and be your king?
[02:50:06.996 --> 02:50:08.257]  Can everybody worship me?
[02:50:09.929 --> 02:50:11.650]  Right, I mean, you can have a go, I'm sure.
[02:50:11.650 --> 02:50:15.391]  I'm sure you could, uh, set up your own little stall on the streets.
[02:50:15.391 --> 02:50:22.373]  Maybe I could invade, uh, like they did, uh, hundreds of years ago and take over and you could have a Texas king.
[02:50:22.373 --> 02:50:25.734]  And that's, that's not as strange as having a German king, is it?
[02:50:25.734 --> 02:50:28.174]  No, it's pretty much the same.
[02:50:28.174 --> 02:50:29.335]  Would you like me to be your king?
[02:50:29.335 --> 02:50:32.596]  Would you like to eat cupcakes and stuff with my wife's picture on it?
[02:50:32.596 --> 02:50:35.737]  I mean, that sounds normal.
[02:50:35.737 --> 02:50:36.297]  That's normal.
[02:50:36.957 --> 02:50:39.758]  I'm knocking up a few cupcakes with your face on them.
[02:50:39.758 --> 02:50:41.239]  I've got to settle.
[02:50:41.239 --> 02:50:44.180]  Hey, tell you what, Steve Watson, got it right that time.
[02:50:44.180 --> 02:50:49.262]  Known Steve forever, I just hardly ever talk to him except we're working on stories together here live on air with us.
[02:50:49.262 --> 02:50:57.585]  I want to come back and talk about how long will it take, though, for them to kill the new bride like the prince's father did?
[02:50:57.585 --> 02:51:00.126]  I mean, how long until they kill her like they did Princess Diana?
[02:51:00.126 --> 02:51:01.387]  That's an important question.
[02:51:01.387 --> 02:51:03.748]  My name is Megan, and this is my LifeLock story.
[02:51:04.148 --> 02:51:09.493]  Imagine opening your door and coming face-to-face with your identity thief.
[02:51:09.493 --> 02:51:13.196]  Identity thieves use my identity to buy cell phones and computers online.
[02:51:13.196 --> 02:51:18.240]  They shipped the stolen phones to my home, where they actually staked out my house waiting for the delivery.
[02:51:18.240 --> 02:51:23.665]  Fortunately, Megan had advanced warning from LifeLock, and a potential tragedy was averted.
[02:51:24.005 --> 02:51:31.149]  I believed LifeLock would protect me from identity theft, but when thieves showed up at my home, LifeLock just may have saved more than money.
[02:51:31.149 --> 02:51:33.450]  LifeLock's services are amazing.
[02:51:33.450 --> 02:51:35.971]  They do what they say they'll do, and it's worth it.
[02:51:35.971 --> 02:51:41.094]  LifeLock is on a mission to help stop identity theft, but they can't protect you if you're not a member.
[02:51:41.094 --> 02:51:45.116]  The call takes just minutes, plus you'll get 60 days of LifeLock risk-free.
[02:51:45.116 --> 02:51:49.278]  If you're not delighted, call LifeLock within 60 days of enrollment and you won't pay a cent.
[02:51:49.278 --> 02:51:50.298]  Restrictions apply.
[02:51:50.298 --> 02:51:51.919]  See LifeLock.com for details.
[02:51:52.139 --> 02:51:52.980]  Call 1-800-560-0031.
[02:51:52.980 --> 02:51:53.260]  1-800-560-0031.
[02:51:53.260 --> 02:51:54.521]  1-800-560-0031.
[02:51:54.521 --> 02:52:03.227]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:52:03.227 --> 02:52:04.268]  The real U.S.
[02:52:04.268 --> 02:52:09.571]  unemployment rate is now 22%, and not 9% like what we are told by the mainstream media.
[02:52:09.571 --> 02:52:14.395]  The primary instinct of unemployed Americans is to go to college and seek a higher education.
[02:52:14.395 --> 02:52:19.959]  But all across America, students are graduating with hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt and no jobs.
[02:52:20.339 --> 02:52:28.525]  Most college graduates are now admitting that they would have been better off getting a job at Walmart or McDonald's than having their lives destroyed by student loans.
[02:52:28.525 --> 02:52:36.071]  Our friends at the National Inflation Association are getting ready to release College Conspiracy, the world's most comprehensive documentary ever produced.
[02:52:36.271 --> 02:52:36.491]  We're good.
[02:53:01.186 --> 02:53:06.190]  Freedom, the blistering anti-globalist anthem from the rock band Ravelin.
[02:53:19.227 --> 02:53:23.030]  Just one of 11 great songs from their album, Under the Sun.
[02:53:23.030 --> 02:53:26.113]  Available on iTunes and at Ravelin.com.
[02:53:26.113 --> 02:53:30.977]  R-A-V-I-L-I-N, Ravelin.com.
[02:53:30.977 --> 02:53:33.379]  Spring and a new growing season are here.
[02:53:33.379 --> 02:53:37.123]  Plant a healthy garden easy and fast with OrganicaSeed.com.
[02:53:37.483 --> 02:53:48.028]  Easy, because OrganicaSeed.com offers one of the largest online selections of organic, heirloom, non-hybrid, and untreated seeds, as well as tobacco and cotton seeds at low prices.
[02:53:48.028 --> 02:53:49.949]  Go to OrganicaSeed.com.
[02:53:49.949 --> 02:53:54.811]  Spelled O-R-G-A-N-I-C-A Seed.com.
[02:53:54.811 --> 02:53:56.492]  OrganicaSeed.com.
[02:53:56.492 --> 02:53:59.293]  Remember, OrganicaSeed is healthy seed.
[02:54:03.956 --> 02:54:08.997]  We have Aaron Dykes fills in sometimes when I'm away on assignment or on vacation.
[02:54:08.997 --> 02:54:12.178]  So does Paul Watson, so does the health ranger Mike Adams.
[02:54:12.178 --> 02:54:15.658]  Steve Watson has sat in before, does just an amazing job.
[02:54:15.658 --> 02:54:23.880]  I mean, he's kind of in the jovial, friendly mode when he's on with me, but he really has an incredible grasp of what's happening geopolitically.
[02:54:23.880 --> 02:54:29.842]  That is his specialty as well from college, but just does amazing work at InfoWars.com and PresentPlanet.com.
[02:54:29.842 --> 02:54:31.622]  We're going to go a little bit into overdrive.
[02:54:32.182 --> 02:54:32.582]  I don't know.
[02:54:41.431 --> 02:54:45.813]  The doctors, they've come out and said, yes, Princess Diana was murdered.
[02:54:45.813 --> 02:54:52.916]  And she even told her butler and made a videotape the government sees and a diary that Charles said he was going to kill her in a fake car accident.
[02:54:52.916 --> 02:54:55.897]  That's intelligence agency's favorite way to kill you.
[02:54:55.897 --> 02:54:57.517]  And then there's all the rest of the evidence.
[02:54:57.517 --> 02:54:58.478]  It goes on for hours.
[02:54:58.478 --> 02:55:00.399]  The government still laughs at people.
[02:55:00.399 --> 02:55:07.822]  But this old story of killing the broodmother after she's had the kids is really nothing new.
[02:55:07.822 --> 02:55:10.683]  And are people placing bets on how long
[02:55:11.764 --> 02:55:18.270]  The new prince's wife is going to be alive over there, Steve.
[02:55:18.270 --> 02:55:24.016]  I don't know if they're placing bets, but it's all very similar.
[02:55:24.016 --> 02:55:26.859]  It's all history repeating itself.
[02:55:26.859 --> 02:55:30.302]  She's even got Diana's ring.
[02:55:30.302 --> 02:55:33.545]  That's what they're using for the wedding, which is very symbolic in itself.
[02:55:34.757 --> 02:55:45.267]  Um, I mean, I haven't, I don't spend a lot of time reading into that kind of thing, but, uh, I know people think that's very, a very important symbolic thing.
[02:55:45.267 --> 02:55:52.074]  But look, I mean, the royal family, like we said, they're still very powerful in this country.
[02:55:52.074 --> 02:55:53.275]  They still own more than
[02:55:54.256 --> 02:55:58.638]  Half the land in this country that they just simply seized from the people.
[02:55:58.638 --> 02:56:03.681]  It's propaganda that they don't have power anymore.
[02:56:03.681 --> 02:56:06.882]  That's a PSYOP they put out.
[02:56:06.882 --> 02:56:07.543]  Exactly.
[02:56:07.543 --> 02:56:13.966]  And like you said just the other week, just last week I think, the Queen dissolved the Canadian Parliament.
[02:56:13.966 --> 02:56:17.127]  She's still the head of state in Canada and Australia.
[02:56:17.127 --> 02:56:19.368]  Canada's Parliament was dissolved last week.
[02:56:19.368 --> 02:56:21.089]  And that's not ceremonial by the way.
[02:56:21.089 --> 02:56:22.610]  I mean she owns that country.
[02:56:23.868 --> 02:56:36.814]  Yeah, the Prime Minister effectively said, right, I want to, I want to start this, I want to dissolve this parliament and have an election because basically he's not going to get back in if he continues to seize out the term of the government.
[02:56:36.814 --> 02:56:38.294]  So who did he go to?
[02:56:38.294 --> 02:56:41.536]  He went to the Queen and asked the Queen to dissolve the parliament.
[02:56:41.536 --> 02:56:43.496]  That's exactly what the Queen did.
[02:56:43.496 --> 02:56:47.158]  So, you know, and that can happen in this country.
[02:56:47.158 --> 02:56:50.419]  The Queen can just replace our government any time she pleases.
[02:56:50.419 --> 02:56:51.520]  But she doesn't have any power.
[02:56:52.691 --> 02:56:55.753]  Well, that's the smoke and mirrors, isn't it?
[02:56:55.753 --> 02:56:58.475]  And the bombardment of Libya is not a war.
[02:56:58.475 --> 02:57:00.137]  And the ground troops are not ground troops.
[02:57:00.137 --> 02:57:03.820]  They pledged no ground troops, even though ground troops were already there.
[02:57:03.820 --> 02:57:07.963]  What's your take on that, Steve?
[02:57:07.963 --> 02:57:09.264]  Well, the ground troops, I mean...
[02:57:11.934 --> 02:57:17.396]  Yesterday the British government said that they were sending in scout parties that are not ground troops.
[02:57:17.396 --> 02:57:19.097]  They're help teams.
[02:57:19.097 --> 02:57:21.077]  They're there to help the rebels.
[02:57:21.077 --> 02:57:24.078]  So, I mean, this is more Orwellian doublespeak.
[02:57:24.078 --> 02:57:26.499]  We're not at war with Libya.
[02:57:26.499 --> 02:57:29.320]  We are at kinetic military action.
[02:57:29.320 --> 02:57:31.081]  We're engaging in kinetic military action.
[02:57:31.081 --> 02:57:32.181]  We're not engaging in war.
[02:57:32.181 --> 02:57:34.062]  We're not sending in ground troops.
[02:57:34.062 --> 02:57:35.342]  We're sending in help squads.
[02:57:37.830 --> 02:57:38.151]  What else?
[02:57:38.151 --> 02:57:42.417]  We've got the EU that wants to send in a thousand troops.
[02:57:42.417 --> 02:57:46.744]  And last time I checked, the EU doesn't even have a standing army.
[02:57:46.744 --> 02:57:47.525]  So basically...
[02:57:48.829 --> 02:57:56.255]  Every single member state of the EU is going to be beholden to sending in troops should it be judged by the UN, should it be given authority.
[02:57:56.255 --> 02:57:59.377]  How about we send in Herman Van Rompuy and people?
[02:57:59.377 --> 02:58:01.979]  How about we put a pack on his back and send him in against Gaddafi?
[02:58:01.979 --> 02:58:08.504]  Because, you know, at least the old kings, the old tyrants would take the field and chop people up and they got power the old-fashioned way.
[02:58:08.504 --> 02:58:10.846]  We're ruled by a bunch of chicken-neck bloodsuckers.
[02:58:13.001 --> 02:58:13.421]  Exactly.
[02:58:13.421 --> 02:58:19.765]  I mean, it's not... There are people within the EU and our national governments that don't support this.
[02:58:19.765 --> 02:58:33.434]  I mean, the French foreign minister yesterday said it was tantamount to a military operation, which completely violates and contravenes the UN resolution that they keep bringing up and going over.
[02:58:33.434 --> 02:58:34.595]  Stay there, extremists!
[02:58:34.595 --> 02:58:38.618]  You don't want to bow down to that old murderous witch, Queen Elizabeth II.
[02:58:38.618 --> 02:58:39.858]  And I do mean number two.
[02:58:39.858 --> 02:58:40.339]  Stay with us.
[02:58:43.974 --> 02:58:47.397]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:58:52.281 --> 02:59:07.754]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.

[02:59:52.334 --> 02:59:53.855]  Coast to Coast.
[02:59:53.855 --> 02:59:55.916]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.916 --> 02:59:59.118]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:14.193 --> 03:00:18.379]  Alright, final segment with Steve Watson and you're going to hear more on this show.
[03:00:18.379 --> 03:00:22.244]  Great video, Skype connection to London.
[03:00:22.244 --> 03:00:23.325]  He's got his answer to 1984, 1776 shirt.
[03:00:23.325 --> 03:00:23.926]  Everybody can just...
[03:00:28.237 --> 03:00:32.599]  With a white t-shirt and black shoe polish, make your own 1776 shirt.
[03:00:32.599 --> 03:00:33.660]  They'll know what it means.
[03:00:33.660 --> 03:00:35.021]  Get out there.
[03:00:35.021 --> 03:00:39.383]  The corrupt British government run by the globalists says you cannot protest.
[03:00:39.383 --> 03:00:48.868]  The disgusting princeling, the droppings of the old witch, and his broodmate to produce more demon goblins.
[03:00:48.868 --> 03:00:52.470]  It is now time to let them know that we are not their slaves.
[03:00:52.470 --> 03:00:53.030]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:00:56.292 --> 03:01:00.097]  Okay, you're not getting control of my country even though you've tried, globalist.
[03:01:00.097 --> 03:01:09.030]  Going back to Steve over there in Airstrip One, finishing up with your views on the whole geopolitical ramifications of the globalists trying to destabilize the Middle East.
[03:01:09.030 --> 03:01:09.831]  Why do you think they're doing that?
[03:01:11.496 --> 03:01:33.843]  Well they're doing it for, well it's threefold really, they're doing it for oil, they're doing it for the banking, central banking, you know the rebels set up a, magically set up a central bank within days of the military action over there and they're doing it for geopolitical strategic reasons and it's, they all
[03:01:35.063 --> 03:01:37.023]  They all overflow each other.
[03:01:37.023 --> 03:01:41.844]  I mean, they're stoking up a civil war over there, which is exactly what they did in Iraq.
[03:01:41.844 --> 03:01:44.965]  It's the same operation.
[03:01:44.965 --> 03:02:00.187]  Of course, the other day it came out that the conspiracy theorists that said the Iraq war was about securing the country so that the oil megacorporations could go in, suck out the reserves, it turns out they were right.
[03:02:00.187 --> 03:02:02.428]  Through cables that were released that
[03:02:03.248 --> 03:02:18.135]  That proved that five months before Iraq, the British government was meeting with BP and Shell to lobby the Bush administration to get them a piece of the jigsaw over there.
[03:02:18.135 --> 03:02:19.916]  It's exactly the same in Libya.
[03:02:19.916 --> 03:02:25.639]  Libya's got the largest proven oil reserves in North Africa.
[03:02:25.639 --> 03:02:27.040]  And of course in 2009,
[03:02:30.382 --> 03:02:41.018]  Gaddafi proposed nationalizing it all, which is obviously poison talk to the globalist interests that want to get in there, get a piece of that for themselves.
[03:02:44.059 --> 03:02:49.986]  They had a National Central Bank as well, which is a very rare thing these days.
[03:02:49.986 --> 03:02:58.255]  Normally it's all owned by corporate shareholders who own all the megacorporations, the oil companies as well.
[03:02:58.255 --> 03:02:59.737]  Libya had its own national bank.
[03:03:00.578 --> 03:03:17.510]  It had its own currency, which I'm sure will be swiftly replaced, and the country will be flooded with worthless dollars and... Oh yeah, the East is already setting up its own central bank currency and oil company.
[03:03:17.510 --> 03:03:18.471]  They're not wasting time.
[03:03:19.898 --> 03:03:20.859]  No, exactly.
[03:03:20.859 --> 03:03:33.849]  I'm sure we'll see rabid inflation there, which will counteract the fact that they've got... Libya has vast reserves of gold to back up their national currency.
[03:03:33.849 --> 03:03:43.917]  From the poorest to the richest in 40 years, they don't like it and they're gonna wreck it and roll in with the UN and special injections for the population that's tripled.
[03:03:43.917 --> 03:03:45.639]  They've got special shots for them, Steve.
[03:03:47.000 --> 03:03:48.060]  Yeah, I haven't heard about this.
[03:03:48.060 --> 03:03:48.801]  What's this?
[03:03:48.801 --> 03:03:53.423]  Oh, well, you know, once the globalists take over, they've got special UN shots filled with sterilization hormones.
[03:03:53.423 --> 03:03:54.683]  Oh, yeah.
[03:03:54.683 --> 03:03:57.504]  Well, I mean, that's what they do.
[03:03:57.504 --> 03:04:01.446]  But, I mean, what you gotta do is just look at a map.
[03:04:01.446 --> 03:04:05.227]  Um, you've got Libya, Egypt's on one side.
[03:04:05.227 --> 03:04:10.809]  You've got Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan on the other.
[03:04:10.809 --> 03:04:12.350]  In the middle of that, you've got Iran.
[03:04:13.769 --> 03:04:15.571]  That's in the offing for them as well.
[03:04:15.571 --> 03:04:21.339]  Down the bottom you've got Yemen, Somalia, Sudan.
[03:04:21.339 --> 03:04:28.448]  And then once you've democratised all those countries, you basically surround Russia and China.
[03:04:28.448 --> 03:04:29.769]  So that's the other reason why
[03:04:30.936 --> 03:04:32.898]  We're seeing what we're seeing in Libya at the moment.
[03:04:32.898 --> 03:04:35.921]  And by the way, in closing, they're not democratizing them.
[03:04:35.921 --> 03:04:40.245]  They've now banned any protest in Egypt, and they're putting in the... Democratizing.
[03:04:40.245 --> 03:04:42.267]  Yes, absolutely enslaving them.
[03:04:42.267 --> 03:04:48.954]  Steve Watson, also known as Paul Watson, joking folks, they are two brothers, over at PrisonPlanet.com, continuing the great work.
[03:04:48.954 --> 03:04:51.517]  Thanks for joining us, and I hope you have fun at the Royal Wedding.
[03:04:53.064 --> 03:04:55.793]  I shall, I shall bring back lots of reports.
[03:04:55.793 --> 03:04:57.437]  Everyone's looking forward to it!
[03:04:57.437 --> 03:04:59.504]  Oh my gosh, no one can wait in England!
[03:04:59.504 --> 03:05:00.647]  It's so wonderful!
[03:05:00.647 --> 03:05:01.610]  Oh, a free cupcake!
