[00:00:04.963 --> 00:00:09.786]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.786 --> 00:00:11.407]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.407 --> 00:00:12.928]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.928 --> 00:00:17.111]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.111 --> 00:00:25.297]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.297 --> 00:00:28.359]  Okay, folks, big show lined up for you today, obviously.
[00:00:29.465 --> 00:00:36.047]  Here we are, Wednesday, the 28th day of December 2011.
[00:00:36.047 --> 00:00:37.207]  And you want him, you've got him.
[00:00:37.207 --> 00:00:42.969]  Lindsey Williams is going to be on with us in the third hour with his former oil company exec source.
[00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:45.010]  Much of what he's predicted has come true.
[00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.111]  Some of it hasn't, as the globalists, according to his source, have changed their plans.
[00:00:49.111 --> 00:00:53.873]  But basically, pretty much everything his source is putting out now is just there for the world to see.
[00:00:55.294 --> 00:01:02.784]  And we'll be getting Lindsey Williams on to discuss all of this with us in the third hour today and to take your calls.
[00:01:02.784 --> 00:01:05.948]  Dr. Busby is going to be joining us.
[00:01:05.948 --> 00:01:09.913]  He's one of the foremost experts on radiation.
[00:01:10.919 --> 00:01:16.765]  He's a British scientist known for his reports about the negative health effects of very low-dose radiation.
[00:01:16.765 --> 00:01:24.154]  Busby is the director of Green Audit Environmental Consultancy Agency Scientific Advisor for the Low-Level Radiation Campaign, which was set up in 1995.
[00:01:25.615 --> 00:01:34.238]  He's a professor at the University of Ulster, and of course he also has advised the BBC, the EU, and other major groups and organizations.
[00:01:34.238 --> 00:01:40.560]  And he gave us really accurate information the first few weeks of Fukushima that turned out to be absolutely accurate.
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.540]  That was pretty shocking at the time.
[00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:54.364]  So we'll get about a 45-minute update on Fukushima and just that ongoing disaster with Dr. Busby, Christopher Busby, coming up in part of the second hour today.
[00:01:56.107 --> 00:02:17.516]  Now, I ended up covering something last night on the news because a listener mentioned it, and it reminded me of a big hit piece in CBS News and other publications and TV programs last week, where the system gets very upset when I touch upon a certain area, because it hits at the core of what they're doing.
[00:02:17.516 --> 00:02:20.598]  Changing the human species as we know it.
[00:02:20.598 --> 00:02:25.060]  Genetic, chemical, biological manipulation is going on on record.
[00:02:25.911 --> 00:02:40.235]  The World Eugenics Dictatorship, that's in control of almost every nation, for now 40 years, it'll be 40 years in a few months, has been taking blood from all children at birth and saying it's for a blood test when it really goes in a eugenics database.
[00:02:40.235 --> 00:02:43.496]  I told you that 15 years ago, it was declassified 4 years ago.
[00:02:44.411 --> 00:02:48.174]  That's just to give you an example of what's really going on.
[00:02:48.174 --> 00:02:52.218]  And what's really going on is there's a huge secret global system.
[00:02:52.218 --> 00:02:57.702]  The documents we have from it are voluminous, but imagine what we don't know.
[00:02:57.702 --> 00:03:09.853]  And so, I thought I would get into the chemical, biological, radiological, genetic manipulation going on, the DNA damage happening to humans.
[00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.460]  This is the real world.
[00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:22.366]  We're down here with American Idol and Dancing with the Stars and X Factor and the NFL and celebrities and all the rest of it.
[00:03:22.366 --> 00:03:25.868]  Meanwhile, the scientific dictators could care less about all that.
[00:03:25.868 --> 00:03:30.071]  That's just stimuli, tribal manipulation they use to control us.
[00:03:30.071 --> 00:03:38.076]  And they try to steer art and literature and information and entertainment so that it never points in the direction of reality.
[00:03:40.157 --> 00:03:50.482]  Nevertheless, some of their own people do like to throw it in our face from time to time, like Aldous Huxley, who wrote in 1932 basically what they've now achieved.
[00:03:50.482 --> 00:04:03.827]  Girls going into puberty at age 5, men not going into puberty until 15, feminized, breast cancer off the charts, other cancers directly linked to bisphenol A, but that's only one chemical.
[00:04:03.827 --> 00:04:06.869]  So I thought I'd spend some more time on this today.
[00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:09.090]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour,
[00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:11.870]  I will get into that.
[00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:17.734]  And before that, I will get into all of the news.
[00:04:17.734 --> 00:04:20.396]  Here's some of the key news coming up.
[00:04:20.396 --> 00:04:25.299]  Iran promises to close down oil route if sanctions imposed.
[00:04:25.299 --> 00:04:27.500]  That's at Infowars.com.
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.463]  For the second time in two days, Iran is threatening to shut down the Strait of Hormuz.
[00:04:32.043 --> 00:04:41.467]  If new sanctions are imposed in response to its nuclear program, Vice President of Iran threatened Tuesday to close down the strait and cut off oil exports.
[00:04:41.467 --> 00:04:44.469]  The West imposes sanctions on the country's oil shipments.
[00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:53.212]  So they say, you cut us off, we cut you off, because they import around half their oil, or around half their refined gasoline.
[00:04:53.212 --> 00:04:55.874]  They have plenty of oil, at some of the refineries.
[00:04:55.874 --> 00:04:58.795]  So we'll be breaking all of that down on the other side.
[00:05:01.505 --> 00:05:05.529]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:08.773]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:05:08.773 --> 00:05:14.339]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:19.965]  Tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:05:19.965 --> 00:05:22.207]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:05:22.748 --> 00:05:23.048]  Tim Geithner?
[00:05:23.048 --> 00:05:23.568]  Bernanke?
[00:05:23.568 --> 00:05:24.349]  They're arsonists!
[00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:25.329]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:05:25.329 --> 00:05:27.751]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:05:41.638 --> 00:05:48.922]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:05:48.922 --> 00:05:58.046]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:06:00.185 --> 00:06:01.487]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:06:01.487 --> 00:06:07.074]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:06:07.074 --> 00:06:12.101]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:06:12.101 --> 00:06:17.147]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:06:17.668 --> 00:06:22.892]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:06:22.892 --> 00:06:25.214]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[00:06:25.214 --> 00:06:29.998]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:06:29.998 --> 00:06:31.119]  And here's the best part.
[00:06:31.119 --> 00:06:34.202]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:06:34.202 --> 00:06:37.485]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:06:37.805 --> 00:06:40.988]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:06:40.988 --> 00:06:43.210]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[00:06:44.151 --> 00:06:44.351]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:06:44.351 --> 00:06:47.794]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:06:47.794 --> 00:06:49.535]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:06:59.935 --> 00:07:01.497]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:07:01.497 --> 00:07:07.803]  This holiday season, more than half of our nation is in need of help due to the shattered economy.

[00:08:01.744 --> 00:08:08.370]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:17.137]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.137 --> 00:08:21.401]  It is Wednesday, 28th day of December 2011, the waning twilight.
[00:08:26.519 --> 00:08:31.461]  The dusk as night falls on 2011.
[00:08:31.461 --> 00:08:36.684]  Iran promises to close down oil route if sanctions imposed.
[00:08:36.684 --> 00:08:41.906]  We have a detailed report and breakdown by Kurt Nemo at InfoWars.com.
[00:08:41.906 --> 00:08:46.388]  Then of course we also have Haratz out of England, out of Israel.
[00:08:48.129 --> 00:08:51.250]  And we also have a report out of the BBC reporting the same thing.
[00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:52.791]  Israel, U.S.
[00:08:52.791 --> 00:08:59.013]  discuss triggers for military strike on Iran.
[00:08:59.013 --> 00:09:04.655]  Newsweek's The Daily Beast is also reporting that countries are discussing red lines
[00:09:05.839 --> 00:09:12.882]  In Iran's nuclear program that if crossed would justify a preemptive strike on its nuclear facilities.
[00:09:12.882 --> 00:09:17.745]  What about the red lines of our so-called government stealing tens of trillions of dollars?
[00:09:17.745 --> 00:09:28.770]  What about the red lines of our so-called government setting up FEMA camps and openly saying they'll use the military against the American people to put us in FEMA camps and secretly arrest us?
[00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:30.991]  What about all those red lines being crossed?
[00:09:32.199 --> 00:09:39.723]  Here's another one, another report, dealing basically with the same subject out of Haratz or Haritz.
[00:09:39.723 --> 00:09:45.487]  Israel could easily attack Iran.
[00:09:45.487 --> 00:09:55.232]  Israel, the United States, and others are saying last week the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said that, oh, we can easily attack Iran.
[00:09:55.232 --> 00:09:57.954]  I just don't think Iran understands that.
[00:09:59.591 --> 00:10:11.701]  Oh, I think Iran understands that well and is preparing to block the Strait of Hormuz that will conservatively double oil prices in this nation.
[00:10:11.701 --> 00:10:16.465]  Continuing, Iran, again, could easily block vital oil route.
[00:10:16.465 --> 00:10:27.114]  Admiral warns, Iran's Navy commander says blocking oil flow to the Strait of Hormuz would be as easy for us as drinking a glass of water.
[00:10:28.228 --> 00:10:35.879]  So again, Iran's Navy commander says blocking oil flow to the Strait of Hormuz would be as easy for us as drinking a glass of water.
[00:10:37.245 --> 00:10:49.188]  Iran could easily block oil flow through the Strait of Hormuz, a vital transit route for Persian Gulf oil, if Western governments impose further sanctions on the Islamic State, Iran's Navy commander said Wednesday.
[00:10:49.188 --> 00:10:59.031]  Blocking the Strait of Hormuz would be as easy for us as drinking a glass of water, but for the time being there is no need to do so, their head admiral told Iran's press TV.
[00:11:00.222 --> 00:11:11.172]  The European Union has threatened to expand its sanctions on Iran after the UN Atomic Watchdog published a report in November expressing serious concern over the country's controversial nuclear program.
[00:11:11.172 --> 00:11:13.694]  Well, why can Israel have 400 nukes then?
[00:11:13.694 --> 00:11:20.981]  EU foreign ministers plan to discuss a possible Iranian oil embargo at their next meeting on January 30th.
[00:11:22.142 --> 00:11:35.213]  The Admiral's comments follow a televised statement by Iran's Vice President, who on Tuesday warned that Iran would not allow one drop of oil to cross the Strait of Hormuz should Western governments impose further sanctions.
[00:11:35.213 --> 00:11:40.717]  Now, again, the West is saying, that is the bankers that run Europe and the U.S.
[00:11:40.717 --> 00:11:50.646]  and England and Israel, are saying that they will stop ships, they will shut down pipelines, they will not allow oil into Iran and Iran imports around
[00:11:52.553 --> 00:11:54.995]  50% of its refined gasoline.
[00:11:54.995 --> 00:11:56.476]  They have plenty of crude oil.
[00:11:56.476 --> 00:11:57.957]  They don't have the refineries.
[00:11:57.957 --> 00:11:59.999]  They don't have the infrastructure.
[00:11:59.999 --> 00:12:15.012]  And, of course, the globalists want to bomb the sovereign country and destroy its infrastructure, then have internal al-Qaeda groups attack, claim their freedom fighters, and then have Western-backed invasion of the nation, at least on their Western flank, and break it off in some new
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:22.122]  Wahhabist slash Kurdistan situation.
[00:12:22.122 --> 00:12:28.385]  Just like the West is now getting ready to try to break Iraq in three pieces, which is always the plan.
[00:12:28.385 --> 00:12:35.208]  So this is how the globalists destroy national sovereignty and basically turn different sectors into their own little minion-doms.
[00:12:35.208 --> 00:12:39.931]  I'm now inventing words, but that's what, little fiefdoms, little sub-states.
[00:12:39.931 --> 00:12:40.251]  And again,
[00:12:41.607 --> 00:12:44.928]  I'm not saying Iran is some cornucopia of goodness.
[00:12:44.928 --> 00:12:47.289]  I'm not saying their leadership isn't corrupt.
[00:12:47.289 --> 00:12:50.170]  Most governments are run by very wicked people.
[00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:57.233]  It's that our government, along with the British and others, have overthrown Iran not once, not twice, but three times in the last 70 years.
[00:13:00.911 --> 00:13:06.253]  The West has always believed they own Iran and they do not want any sovereign countries.
[00:13:06.253 --> 00:13:07.034]  They don't want the U.S.
[00:13:07.034 --> 00:13:08.454]  being sovereign either.
[00:13:08.454 --> 00:13:20.920]  And so they are basically prodding and pushing and manipulating Iran into some type of response so that Israel and the United States can blast the country into the Stone Age.
[00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:32.768]  And then it'll be off to the races, and Israel will be attacked from all sides, and then Benjamin Netanyahu, with election coming up, can look like the Churchill fighting the evil Hitler.
[00:13:32.768 --> 00:13:37.851]  And that's his advisors that have said that to the Washington Times and others.
[00:13:37.851 --> 00:13:49.219]  And so the war planners and the social engineers know that even if most people are against war, once a big one is kicked off, people tend to get politically in line and do what they're told.
[00:13:50.669 --> 00:13:52.911]  And so, so what if we're in a depression?
[00:13:52.911 --> 00:13:55.213]  So what if they're taking your pension funds?
[00:13:55.213 --> 00:13:56.034]  So what?
[00:13:56.034 --> 00:13:56.454]  You know what?
[00:13:56.454 --> 00:13:59.196]  If you riot, you get shot.
[00:13:59.196 --> 00:14:09.765]  And so, the West wants this new regional war, that many experts agree could lead to World War III, as a political cover for what they're doing.
[00:14:09.765 --> 00:14:11.687]  Europe wants it.
[00:14:11.687 --> 00:14:12.888]  That'll unify the Europe.
[00:14:14.736 --> 00:14:15.016]  I don't know.
[00:14:30.962 --> 00:14:45.434]  So they can then stage false flag terror attacks, or there may even be real ones, domestically and use that to further crack down and roll out the triple funding for TSA checkpoints on the highways that the LA Times announced a few days ago.
[00:14:45.434 --> 00:14:52.619]  The TSA, not just for airports anymore, shopping malls, highways, they're coming to your underwear soon.
[00:14:52.619 --> 00:14:54.621]  Their hands are going in the pants soon.
[00:14:54.621 --> 00:14:57.743]  A total journey into tyranny with the borders wide open.
[00:14:58.584 --> 00:15:04.668]  And all the training manuals are for Christians, Conservatives, Libertarians, Ron Paul type supporters.
[00:15:04.668 --> 00:15:09.110]  People that understand what's going on.
[00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:21.437]  Now if you actually read the UN report as Ron Paul has said, it says they fear they could use this down the road to get material to build a nuclear weapon.
[00:15:21.437 --> 00:15:23.539]  And this is just a replay of
[00:15:25.103 --> 00:15:31.366]  Bush and Colin Powell with the Anthrax vials saying, here are the photos of the trucks, here is the Anthrax.
[00:15:31.366 --> 00:15:45.734]  Now they knew those trucks were British sold mobile 18-wheeler trailers that pump up hydrogen balloons for directing artillery that the British and the US sold to them.
[00:15:47.193 --> 00:15:47.493]  U.S.
[00:15:47.493 --> 00:16:01.044]  and British systems were sold to them for the seven-year, seven and a half, Iran-Iraq war that was fully funded by the West to have the Muslims kill each other again and get them all into debt again.
[00:16:01.044 --> 00:16:06.029]  And the establishment didn't like it that Saddam was actually paying back his debts.
[00:16:06.029 --> 00:16:08.971]  And he said, can I invade Kuwait or steal them all?
[00:16:08.971 --> 00:16:10.372]  And the West said, go ahead.
[00:16:10.372 --> 00:16:13.395]  April Gillespie said, we don't get involved in inter-Arab affairs.
[00:16:13.395 --> 00:16:15.697]  And the same thing they told him whenever he attacked Iran.
[00:16:16.587 --> 00:16:18.268]  And he said, OK, I'll attack.
[00:16:18.268 --> 00:16:21.370]  They said, go ahead.
[00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:24.372]  That's how they manipulate these people, just like Manuel Noriega.
[00:16:24.372 --> 00:16:30.716]  He'd been in prison for decades on record, shipping drugs out of Panama into the U.S.
[00:16:30.716 --> 00:16:32.037]  for the CIA.
[00:16:32.037 --> 00:16:38.542]  And then he got a little uppity and started buying palaces in Switzerland bigger than The Globalist.
[00:16:38.542 --> 00:16:41.764]  And they just said, oh, my gosh, Manuel Noriega.
[00:16:42.759 --> 00:16:44.801]  This is all in the film The Panama Deception.
[00:16:44.801 --> 00:16:48.403]  He has kidnapped American college students in Panama.
[00:16:48.403 --> 00:17:08.019]  And then when the special forces got there after blowing up and engaging in mass murder in Panama City, with C-130s flying around with cannons and Gatling guns just randomly blowing everything up and shooting everybody up, it shows the college students come out and they go, no one ever held us here, but we appreciate the Army being here just for our safety.
[00:17:09.403 --> 00:17:10.543]  None of it was true.
[00:17:10.543 --> 00:17:11.584]  None of it was real.
[00:17:11.584 --> 00:17:13.464]  It was all just completely made up.
[00:17:13.464 --> 00:17:15.365]  Everybody's like, good, kill him!
[00:17:15.365 --> 00:17:15.865]  Kill him!
[00:17:15.865 --> 00:17:17.766]  Attack Panama!
[00:17:17.766 --> 00:17:21.847]  Or, you're not a fan of that drug dealer, Manuel Moriega, are you?
[00:17:21.847 --> 00:17:25.969]  This is how stupid the system thinks we are.
[00:17:25.969 --> 00:17:29.010]  This is how dumb the system thinks you are.
[00:17:30.044 --> 00:17:32.745]  And most Americans think Iran is Arab.
[00:17:32.745 --> 00:17:36.126]  They don't even know it's a different group entirely, Persians.
[00:17:36.126 --> 00:17:39.387]  And I hear them on radio saying, kill them Arabs, nuke Iran.
[00:17:39.387 --> 00:17:42.068]  I mean, kill them Arabs in Pakistan.
[00:17:42.068 --> 00:17:43.989]  That's Central Asia, folks.
[00:17:43.989 --> 00:17:45.650]  That's the Himalayas.
[00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:49.031]  I mean, it is just, they're brown, kill them.
[00:17:49.031 --> 00:17:50.931]  And it is the height of ignorance.
[00:17:50.931 --> 00:17:57.394]  And while this is happening, while this nation prepares to try to kick off World War III,
[00:17:58.874 --> 00:18:05.155]  The very mega banks that are doing this are dissecting our republic in front of our eyes.
[00:18:05.155 --> 00:18:13.257]  They're destroying the country right there in front of our eyes, overthrowing every form of liberty, every freedom, every check and balance to protect us.
[00:18:13.257 --> 00:18:22.418]  That's all being thrown away, put in the trash, put in a meat grinder, put in a wood chipper.
[00:18:22.418 --> 00:18:24.298]  We are all at the mercy of these people.
[00:18:24.298 --> 00:18:26.299]  We have a video clip up at InfoWars.com.
[00:18:27.898 --> 00:18:30.600]  That activist post ferreted out.
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.181]  And it's World War III countdown.
[00:18:33.181 --> 00:18:36.043]  CFR declares time to attack Iran.
[00:18:36.043 --> 00:18:46.708]  The highly influential Council on Foreign Relations, CFR, declared this month in their online publication, Foreign Affairs, that it's now time to attack Iran.
[00:18:46.708 --> 00:18:50.771]  Subtitled, why a strike is the least bad option.
[00:18:51.818 --> 00:19:05.169]  The Lesser of Evils, and there's a video clip there and a link to where they also say it in print, show the CFR, which is the American ruling class, the real government, the sellouts, and then they have some kind of camp followers.
[00:19:05.169 --> 00:19:11.214]  It's now up to almost 5,000 members, but the inner committee is actually the real government of this country.
[00:19:11.214 --> 00:19:13.416]  They write hundreds of reports in the last
[00:19:14.572 --> 00:19:18.235]  90 years, since 1922 when they were set up at Proud House in New York.
[00:19:18.235 --> 00:19:22.978]  And almost all of them, to the letter, have been implemented.
[00:19:22.978 --> 00:19:26.060]  Homeland Security, all of it.
[00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:33.184]  These commissions, the super committees, they, and then it'll be CFR members who were on those committees.
[00:19:33.184 --> 00:19:35.306]  The North American Union Plan, all of it.
[00:19:36.676 --> 00:19:43.903]  And they openly call for world government, an end to the family, the end of the Second Amendment, the end of private property for the average person.
[00:19:43.903 --> 00:19:54.692]  I mean, it is a treacherous, treacherous group and was set up publicly with the Rockefellers by British intelligence to take over this country.
[00:19:55.638 --> 00:19:57.339]  And I'm sick of it!
[00:19:57.339 --> 00:20:00.580]  It's not the British people, it's the corrupt British crown system!
[00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:06.801]  When the food collapse happens, if trucks stop delivering food to supermarket shelves tomorrow, what will you do?
[00:20:06.801 --> 00:20:09.822]  How well is your family prepared for a food crisis?
[00:20:09.822 --> 00:20:11.163]  How long will you survive?

[00:21:29.338 --> 00:21:30.559]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:30.559 --> 00:21:35.142]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:21:35.142 --> 00:21:40.946]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:21:40.946 --> 00:21:44.588]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:21:44.588 --> 00:21:47.310]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:52.373]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[00:21:52.373 --> 00:21:52.614]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:52.614 --> 00:21:54.015]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:59.418 --> 00:22:03.882]  You don't need me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis.
[00:22:03.882 --> 00:22:05.363]  Everyone can feel it.
[00:22:05.363 --> 00:22:14.270]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:17.433]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising.
[00:22:17.433 --> 00:22:18.754]  But take heart.
[00:22:18.754 --> 00:22:22.557]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[00:22:22.557 --> 00:22:27.521]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war.
[00:22:27.941 --> 00:22:31.784]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[00:22:31.784 --> 00:22:33.505]  The globalists are scared.
[00:22:33.505 --> 00:22:34.845]  They've overreached.
[00:22:34.845 --> 00:22:38.348]  The future of the info war is in your hands.

[00:22:53.738 --> 00:22:56.019]  We are going to use their system against them.
[00:22:56.019 --> 00:22:57.300]  The info war now.
[00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:00.142]  Goes into high gear!
[00:23:00.142 --> 00:23:00.782]  Warning!
[00:23:00.782 --> 00:23:06.966]  The unprepared may not survive the next natural disaster, terrorist attack, pandemic, or economic collapse.

[00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:41.211]  You should already be at your keyboard.
[00:23:41.211 --> 00:23:42.072]  Enough talk.

[00:23:47.756 --> 00:23:49.918]  FreeSurvivalMiniCourse.com.
[00:23:50.518 --> 00:23:50.759]  Or call 800-366-5138.
[00:23:50.759 --> 00:23:50.819]  800-366-5138.
[00:23:50.819 --> 00:23:51.521]  You'll be glad you did.
[00:24:29.286 --> 00:24:38.513]  Alright, there is a video that I'm going to get posted at InfoWars.com in the next 10 minutes.
[00:24:38.513 --> 00:24:39.955]  It's not up there, but it will be.
[00:24:39.955 --> 00:24:47.561]  It's called Alex Covers the Full Spectrum Biological Eugenics Program Against Humanity.
[00:24:49.581 --> 00:25:18.528]  And I guess that's what the folks writing the headline for that gleaned from it, but really I'd cover a tiny, tiny bit of the spectrum, which is about 30-40 articles, where it's admitted that the UN and the world government in Planned Parenthood want to break up the family and put chemicals in the water where you physically cannot be a man or a woman, and basically give you cancer, reduce your life, and murder your hind end.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:30.566]  But they run around giggling and snickering and talking and lisping NPR voices going, hi, we're liberal, because they're psych warfare chiefs.
[00:25:30.566 --> 00:25:43.914]  They're hardcore genocidal maniacs who are so savage and precision-oriented that they have lisping, sneaky, lovey voices while they butcher the daylights out of everybody hardcore.
[00:25:43.914 --> 00:25:47.056]  And I can't even hardly do this radio show anymore.
[00:25:47.056 --> 00:25:48.537]  I sit here and I watch it.
[00:25:51.496 --> 00:25:52.858]  I mean, I'm completely freaked out.
[00:25:52.858 --> 00:25:59.186]  And I said I was going to get to this coming up in the next segment.
[00:25:59.186 --> 00:26:01.248]  We've got to get people out of their trance.
[00:26:01.248 --> 00:26:05.033]  We have got to shake people out of it.
[00:26:05.033 --> 00:26:06.936]  And to a certain extent, that is happening.
[00:26:16.527 --> 00:26:17.268]  You know what it is?
[00:26:17.268 --> 00:26:18.328]  People have given up.
[00:26:18.328 --> 00:26:37.423]  People have decided to myopically just fly their airplane right on the side of a cliff or drive the car off the side of the cliff and people just get focused on their little task in life and the little routine and they just want to live down here in this controlled environment and let a bunch of chicken neck pie
[00:26:37.743 --> 00:26:39.645]  And I, for one, have just had it.
[00:26:39.645 --> 00:26:46.531]  You know, it even contributes to the false reality to debate Newt Gingrich and to try to explain to people that he's New World Order trash.
[00:27:05.134 --> 00:27:08.796]  You see the media endorsing him, that's all you need to have to know.
[00:27:08.796 --> 00:27:13.619]  Or to talk about Mitt Romney rising in the polls in Iowa.
[00:27:13.619 --> 00:27:17.761]  If you can even believe that, Ron Paul still in first place.
[00:27:17.761 --> 00:27:20.163]  I mean, Mitt Romney, a empty
[00:27:22.518 --> 00:27:51.963]  Ghoul in a fancy suit reading talking points at people who supports abortion, open borders, amnesty cities, carbon taxes, world government, wrote Obamacare, and you see the sniveling, cowardly, dumbed-down, simple-minded Republicans running around with limp wrist talking about how great he is because they want to say that they're voting for and endorsing the winner.
[00:27:53.015 --> 00:27:54.616]  They want the delusion.
[00:27:54.616 --> 00:27:56.418]  They want the vapor.
[00:27:56.418 --> 00:28:00.201]  They want the mirage instead of the real thing.
[00:28:00.201 --> 00:28:02.764]  They want Fantasyland.
[00:28:02.764 --> 00:28:06.026]  And most people I talk to are living in Fantasyland.
[00:28:06.026 --> 00:28:08.308]  Well, I'm not living in Fantasyland.
[00:28:08.308 --> 00:28:09.229]  Okay?
[00:28:09.229 --> 00:28:11.131]  I live in the real world.
[00:28:11.131 --> 00:28:13.273]  Every stinking day.
[00:28:13.273 --> 00:28:18.918]  And I have to sit here and watch these control freak globalists getting away with all the stuff they're carrying out.
[00:28:19.705 --> 00:28:29.072]  Murdering people all over the world, forced abortions, jacking the food and water, almost impossible to avoid what they're doing to me, and it makes me angry.
[00:28:29.072 --> 00:28:41.160]  I bet most of you, if you walked up in a restaurant, most of you new listeners that think this is funny, and you saw somebody sticking something in your water, and you found out it was a packet of poison or something, even you'd get angry.
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:41.921]  You'd yell and scream.
[00:28:41.921 --> 00:28:43.602]  You'd probably call for the police to come help you.
[00:28:44.799 --> 00:28:51.843]  Or you might be man enough to actually punch him in the nose, and tackle him, and put him in a headlock.
[00:28:51.843 --> 00:29:01.829]  But I sit here, and I tell you straight-faced, and I give you all the documents, you can just type in, Rick Perry covered up radiation in Texas water.
[00:29:01.829 --> 00:29:05.551]  That all came out because we talked about it.
[00:29:05.551 --> 00:29:10.394]  It's in every state and water supply, because we have a lot of listeners in Texas, so it came out here.
[00:29:12.568 --> 00:29:14.271]  People say, oh, if that was true, we'd know.
[00:29:14.271 --> 00:29:16.675]  The whistleblowers went to the feds and were told to shut up.
[00:29:16.675 --> 00:29:19.320]  It's been going on for 20 years.
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:21.624]  Harry's just the latest person to cover it up.
[00:29:21.624 --> 00:29:24.909]  They put radioactive isotopes in your water.
[00:29:25.856 --> 00:29:29.817]  It's not funny when your kid gets sick and you go to the doctor and you find out they got cancer.
[00:29:29.817 --> 00:29:34.018]  And then nobody tells you why because the doctor goes home and watches TV too.
[00:29:34.018 --> 00:29:38.199]  Or goes and plays golf or has sex with his mistress and doesn't care.
[00:29:38.199 --> 00:29:38.999]  Well, you know what?
[00:29:38.999 --> 00:29:40.220]  I do care.
[00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:40.940]  And you know what?
[00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:42.320]  I'm the sane person.
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:42.900]  Okay?
[00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:46.081]  I'm angry about them putting uranium in my water.
[00:29:46.081 --> 00:29:46.561]  Okay?
[00:29:46.561 --> 00:29:48.502]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:48.502 --> 00:29:49.042]  Stay with us.
[00:29:49.758 --> 00:29:52.767]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.767 --> 00:29:56.379]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.085 --> 00:30:04.627]  And you're subject to other police action.
[00:30:04.627 --> 00:30:05.889]  Tyranny is here.
[00:30:05.889 --> 00:30:09.772]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:30:09.772 --> 00:30:12.074]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:30:12.074 --> 00:30:17.920]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:24.166]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:30:24.586 --> 00:30:30.568]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:30:30.568 --> 00:30:34.749]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:30:34.749 --> 00:30:39.030]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:44.972]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:30:44.972 --> 00:30:48.533]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:30:48.533 --> 00:30:50.514]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:30:50.514 --> 00:30:50.934]  It's here.

[00:31:07.478 --> 00:31:12.619]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:31:12.619 --> 00:31:19.401]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:31:21.363 --> 00:31:27.772]  They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you love the way they fit
[00:31:29.844 --> 00:31:34.448]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[00:31:34.448 --> 00:31:39.512]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it, others don't.
[00:31:39.512 --> 00:31:41.654]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:31:41.654 --> 00:31:43.455]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.

[00:31:55.665 --> 00:31:58.908]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it, others don't.
[00:32:00.094 --> 00:32:04.657]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:32:04.657 --> 00:32:05.558]  Number 1.
[00:32:05.558 --> 00:32:08.981]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:32:08.981 --> 00:32:09.841]  Number 2.
[00:32:09.841 --> 00:32:14.745]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:32:14.745 --> 00:32:15.505]  It's true.
[00:32:15.505 --> 00:32:20.369]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:20.369 --> 00:32:21.190]  Number 3.
[00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:24.772]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:32:24.772 --> 00:32:28.475]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:32:28.675 --> 00:32:29.476]  Number 4.
[00:32:29.476 --> 00:32:32.239]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:32:32.239 --> 00:32:35.923]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:35.923 --> 00:32:36.704]  Number 5.
[00:32:36.704 --> 00:32:40.849]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:32:40.849 --> 00:32:45.614]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:32:45.894 --> 00:32:50.058]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:50.058 --> 00:32:51.860]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:54.102]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:32:54.102 --> 00:32:56.464]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:33:17.867 --> 00:33:20.610]  People need to get angry.
[00:33:20.610 --> 00:33:32.925]  People need to look around them and witness how screwed up this society has gotten and how people from cradle to grave are taught to chase after things that don't matter.
[00:33:32.925 --> 00:33:34.126]  That are like fishing lures.
[00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:44.919]  We're not just mindless little fish that run up and grab a purple worm or a topwater minnow bait because it looks like it's real.
[00:33:44.919 --> 00:33:51.424]  We should be able to be smart enough to analyze it and see the manipulation.
[00:33:51.424 --> 00:33:58.431]  An example is these reports all over the country of brawls and riots and riot police and
[00:33:59.724 --> 00:34:03.686]  Smoke and panicking people stampeding each other.
[00:34:03.686 --> 00:34:09.729]  And hundreds of teenagers running amok at a food court brawl just crazily.
[00:34:09.729 --> 00:34:21.294]  Wanting their Air Jordans and hearing that some rapper might have been at the mall so they descend into absolute insanity.
[00:34:21.294 --> 00:34:28.277]  Thinking that they're gonna be fulfilled.
[00:34:30.865 --> 00:34:36.016]  By chasing after garbage.
[00:34:36.016 --> 00:34:42.188]  It is a false plastic culture that has been forced into these people.
[00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:53.277]  And the individuals that are growing up like this and acting like this, there's major studies out where the language has already been reduced massively.
[00:34:53.277 --> 00:34:57.541]  Most of these teenagers, you try to talk to them, can't even talk.
[00:34:57.541 --> 00:35:02.885]  Or if they do, it's gibberish, verbal versions of text messages.
[00:35:07.281 --> 00:35:11.985]  We are being scientifically reduced, scientifically dumbed down.
[00:35:11.985 --> 00:35:25.236]  In fact, if you guys will give me a document cam shot right here, I will, and if you're a new listener, we're not just on the radio here, we're also simulcasting with video at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:35:25.236 --> 00:35:33.303]  I went over some of this last night, and I want to go over this
[00:35:35.782 --> 00:35:41.079]  Right now, again, today, but in a little bit more abbreviated fashion.
[00:35:42.125 --> 00:35:53.593]  And then we have a special report with all the documentation coming out Thursday or Friday that Aaron Dykes and I are working on a video slash text report that we are putting together.
[00:35:53.593 --> 00:36:04.560]  You see this article from a week ago, CBS News, CBS Nightly News, and there were literally hundreds of these going off the same script, the same talking points.
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:07.923]  It says, Ron Paul disavows racist newsletters under his name.
[00:36:10.231 --> 00:36:14.876]  Okay, and of course you read in here, it's supplement letters.
[00:36:14.876 --> 00:36:27.209]  It's little promo letters by the company he had hired to promote his newsletters to different newsletter lists that would, you know, make comments about, yeah, the people quit rioting when their welfare checks, you know, arrive.
[00:36:28.601 --> 00:36:29.401]  And stuff like that.
[00:36:29.401 --> 00:36:31.563]  So they try to make it, you know, this whole issue.
[00:36:31.563 --> 00:36:35.145]  The racism isn't blowing up brown people all over the world.
[00:36:35.145 --> 00:36:36.045]  No, no, no.
[00:36:36.045 --> 00:36:37.426]  Or... No, no.
[00:36:37.426 --> 00:36:44.930]  It's just digging up some 25-year-old newsletter and making a giant to-do about it, and then asking him over and over again to answer the question.
[00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:47.872]  Even when he's in an interview and answers it three times, they say, answer it.
[00:36:47.872 --> 00:36:48.872]  He won't answer it.
[00:36:48.872 --> 00:36:49.813]  And then he answers it again.
[00:36:49.813 --> 00:36:53.675]  And then they cut back to CNN and they say, well, he wouldn't answer it.
[00:36:53.675 --> 00:36:56.396]  But that's not why I'm getting into this right now.
[00:36:56.396 --> 00:36:57.197]  In this article,
[00:36:59.551 --> 00:37:16.798]  They say, and it's the same in hundreds of these, that Paul's willingness to appear on the radio program of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, and remember conspiracy theorist means someone not buying what confirmed liars who've been caught lying thousands of times,
[00:37:18.248 --> 00:37:32.714]  And caught putting poison in the water and giving black men syphilis and little kids in Honduras syphilis and last year giving kids all over the world in polio vaccines, live polio and killing them.
[00:37:32.714 --> 00:37:34.915]  Not trusting those people.
[00:37:34.915 --> 00:37:37.776]  A government caught shipping drugs in thousands of times.
[00:37:37.776 --> 00:37:40.137]  A government caught shipping guns into Mexico.
[00:37:40.137 --> 00:37:43.719]  Caught blowing up Oklahoma City.
[00:37:43.719 --> 00:37:46.460]  Conspiracy theorist means a sane person.
[00:37:48.493 --> 00:38:00.409]  Oh look, 72% of cities fluoridate their water, and if you look at what's in the so-called fluoride, in almost every case it's got radioactive isotopes from the limestone where they mine this.
[00:38:02.575 --> 00:38:06.477]  Oh gee, that's bad news.
[00:38:06.477 --> 00:38:18.264]  See, I know that the American Medical Association was forced to admit that fluoride fractures your teeth and causes dental fluorosis, and the American Dental Association was forced to admit it six years ago as well.
[00:38:18.264 --> 00:38:31.571]  I knew back when I got made fun of that bisphenol A was massively increasing different forms of cancers in sexual tissue, ovaries, testicles, breast, things like that, prostates.
[00:38:33.985 --> 00:38:47.188]  Because I had the hundreds and hundreds of mainline university studies then, because I interview the top scientists here every day, like Dr. Busby, that's coming up in the next hour.
[00:38:47.188 --> 00:38:48.869]  You see?
[00:38:48.869 --> 00:38:51.830]  So, I'm aware of all of this information.
[00:38:51.830 --> 00:38:53.730]  I know what's going on.
[00:38:53.730 --> 00:38:55.170]  I've got my head screwed on straight.
[00:38:55.170 --> 00:38:57.151]  But hey, what do they care to their readers?
[00:38:57.151 --> 00:39:00.472]  Oh, Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist.
[00:39:01.443 --> 00:39:07.846]  I watched the Reactor 3 MOX plutonium reactor blow sky-high, ejecting fuel rods.
[00:39:07.846 --> 00:39:12.789]  I went and blew up the plans of it online, blew it up, researched it, got top scientists on.
[00:39:12.789 --> 00:39:17.711]  I said, Dr. Busby and others, that looks like fuel rods going sky-high.
[00:39:17.711 --> 00:39:24.935]  And they said they were storing hundreds of thousands of them, over 200,000 of the 600-plus thousand that were stored there, on top of that MOX 3.
[00:39:26.929 --> 00:39:29.572]  And he said, yes, those are fuel rods being blown sky high.
[00:39:29.572 --> 00:39:31.834]  And then I talked to other experts that had him on.
[00:39:31.834 --> 00:39:35.437]  Former head of the Star Wars program had him study the video for us.
[00:39:35.437 --> 00:39:39.321]  Then we had top radiologists on and radiation experts who...
[00:39:41.059 --> 00:39:41.980]  We're good to go.
[00:40:11.297 --> 00:40:20.309]  What it previously was, depending on the isotope, I say, you know, they said this lower level was not safe, now they're saying a higher level's safe.
[00:40:20.309 --> 00:40:26.337]  That's just waving a magic wand, because I have a tiny thimble of critical thinking.
[00:40:26.337 --> 00:40:28.841]  I am a conspiracy theorist.
[00:40:31.091 --> 00:40:33.796]  Hey, the Pentagon says they want to put troops on the streets.
[00:40:33.796 --> 00:40:35.318]  Here's the Army Times.
[00:40:35.318 --> 00:40:36.420]  Here's Stars and Stripes.
[00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:38.162]  Shut up, conspiracy theorist!
[00:40:38.162 --> 00:40:41.828]  No, it's the government says they're going to be patrolling America with the military.
[00:40:41.828 --> 00:40:42.910]  Shut up, crazy man!
[00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:45.333]  But, I mean, it's in the Stars and Stripes.
[00:40:47.557 --> 00:41:05.729]  Now they've passed the NDAA to have the military arrest you and you disappear forever, and I can play five senators that authored the bill saying that's what it does, and it says it in clear English, and they've got articles out in the news today saying I'm a conspiracy theorist, because I know how to read!
[00:41:10.071 --> 00:41:24.563]  This is their response because they know the public more and more is like the snot-nosed teenagers who can't even talk, text messaging each other, running around who feel totally empty, but if they could just see a celebrity, their life would be made.
[00:41:24.563 --> 00:41:27.225]  It'd be like if they could just find a unicorn.
[00:41:27.225 --> 00:41:30.208]  It doesn't do anything to meet a celebrity.
[00:41:30.208 --> 00:41:31.209]  It doesn't do anything.
[00:41:31.209 --> 00:41:32.590]  They're just like other people.
[00:41:33.749 --> 00:41:40.815]  Now, there are painters and artists and musicians and people I'd love to meet, but not because they're a celebrity, because they're an interesting person.
[00:41:40.815 --> 00:41:44.678]  And they have celebrity because of their talent.
[00:41:44.678 --> 00:41:46.800]  But more and more of these celebrities, it's not even that.
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:51.343]  They're purely manufactured crud to sell an agenda.
[00:41:51.343 --> 00:41:55.627]  And you've got people rioting to buy overpriced shoes that are ugly.
[00:41:57.375 --> 00:42:01.457]  And people are teaching their kids, I love you because I got you this.
[00:42:01.457 --> 00:42:05.658]  I got you a Kinect Microsoft that spies on you.
[00:42:05.658 --> 00:42:22.245]  So you can live in a fantasy land with your friends and be a space captain who beats aliens all day while a real world and a real war is going on against each and every one of us and the future destiny of this species is being decided and we have a nation of a bunch of addled...
[00:42:23.402 --> 00:42:39.512]  Arrested Development men and women, and I'll tell you why, because they're jacking the food and water with chemicals, and biologicals, and radiologicals, and they are jacking our psyche with propaganda and mind-numbing trash, and the brainwaves are lower in the Western world now.
[00:42:39.512 --> 00:42:46.397]  The average person is in a dream state, and I am here to break you out of it!
[00:42:46.397 --> 00:42:50.780]  If you're giggling hearing this right now, it's because you've been pre-programmed, pal.
[00:42:52.745 --> 00:42:53.965]  Now listen to this article.
[00:42:53.965 --> 00:42:57.686]  Listen to CBS News.
[00:42:57.686 --> 00:43:03.727]  The reporter tied the newsletters to Paul's willingness to appear on the radio program of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:43:03.727 --> 00:43:05.288]  Forget everything I say.
[00:43:05.288 --> 00:43:09.149]  Forget me saying it's wrong to torture people's children in front of them.
[00:43:09.149 --> 00:43:11.829]  Army's own report.
[00:43:11.829 --> 00:43:13.509]  Army report on Abu Ghraib.
[00:43:13.509 --> 00:43:14.290]  Just type that in.
[00:43:14.290 --> 00:43:16.490]  Read it if you've got the will.
[00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:19.751]  How they raped the kids with the battery acid.
[00:43:19.751 --> 00:43:20.131]  Oh yeah.
[00:43:21.226 --> 00:43:26.389]  Hell razor tight, Jeffrey Dahmer doesn't even approach it!
[00:43:26.389 --> 00:43:34.154]  And murdering children, and murdering people's wives, and that's what we signed on to, and you're worried about Iran.
[00:43:34.154 --> 00:43:42.179]  You better be worried about the globalists who see us as animals, as lower than rat droppings!
[00:43:42.179 --> 00:43:42.680]  It goes on.
[00:43:44.008 --> 00:43:57.339]  Paul's willingness to appear on the radio program of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who reportedly accused the government of encouraging homosexuality with chemicals so that people don't have children.
[00:43:57.339 --> 00:44:03.844]  He noted that Paul seemed open to Jones' suggestion that the military NORTHCOM combatant command
[00:44:06.590 --> 00:44:08.151]  Is taking over the nation.
[00:44:08.151 --> 00:44:11.193]  Gee, that's what a command is, is a war zone.
[00:44:11.193 --> 00:44:13.154]  They say they're going to operate.
[00:44:13.154 --> 00:44:14.254]  They're going to arrest citizens.
[00:44:14.254 --> 00:44:17.516]  They're now running military checkpoints everywhere with TSA.
[00:44:17.516 --> 00:44:26.441]  And this, remember, the CBS is saying I'm crazy while the NDAA and all of this is one of the hottest topics in the news.
[00:44:26.441 --> 00:44:28.542]  All of this is happening now.
[00:44:28.542 --> 00:44:34.726]  And I'm more of a kook because world government's being announced by the very banks we said that would run it through the derivatives.
[00:44:35.962 --> 00:44:37.708]  Exactly as we said.
[00:44:37.708 --> 00:44:38.330]  Not hard.
[00:44:38.330 --> 00:44:39.975]  It's all trilateral CFR plans.
[00:44:42.682 --> 00:44:51.386]  I'm more of a kook because they now admit that BPA is sterilizing people and making men feminine and women hyper-feminine and giving them cancer.
[00:44:51.386 --> 00:44:55.587]  I'm more of a kook because they're now putting the TSA and the troops on the streets.
[00:44:55.587 --> 00:45:03.691]  I'm more of a kook because I'm right and I'm accurate and I'm real and I've studied history and I know what I'm talking about.
[00:45:03.691 --> 00:45:08.713]  And what's even more frustrating is when you find out this propaganda is for people who are in a trance.
[00:45:09.213 --> 00:45:11.214]  You read it, and you're like, but all of this is admitted!
[00:45:11.214 --> 00:45:12.835]  How am I a conspiracy theorist?
[00:45:12.835 --> 00:45:20.078]  How do they sit up there with this moral judgment, and if they say it isn't real, it isn't?
[00:45:20.078 --> 00:45:20.778]  How do they do that?
[00:45:22.503 --> 00:45:36.696]  They do it with child-like gullible people who they have nothing but disdain and hatred for, who watch, this is a transcript of CBS Nightly News, who sit there and watch it and think, oh, and feel good about themselves.
[00:45:36.696 --> 00:45:39.078]  I'm not a theorist like Alex Jones.
[00:45:39.078 --> 00:45:40.279]  I trust my government.
[00:45:40.279 --> 00:45:42.982]  Honey, get me a big Bremming cup of that tap water.
[00:45:44.435 --> 00:45:51.139]  Stick me a BPA lined TV dinner in the microwave and heat it up so I get a mega dose of it.
[00:45:51.139 --> 00:45:57.984]  And give me some powdered eggs that are 200 parts per million fluoride in it.
[00:45:57.984 --> 00:46:00.085]  Total brain damaging, rat poison.
[00:46:00.085 --> 00:46:01.446]  Give me some of that, baby.
[00:46:01.446 --> 00:46:04.268]  Because I'm not going to listen to that bad man.
[00:46:07.435 --> 00:46:18.238]  The good news is, more and more people aren't listening to this and are kind of waking up from the trance, at least partially, so that's why they're coming out with the SOPA bill.
[00:46:18.238 --> 00:46:34.162]  Which, by the way, inventors of the internet, Google, Yahoo, all of them admit, yes, it's the end of the internet and the selective shutdown, Chinese-style censorship, it's selective internet kill switch, and Cass Sunstein at the White House says they will shut down people that don't believe man-made global warming's real.
[00:46:36.266 --> 00:46:39.007]  I mean, see, here's the thing.
[00:46:39.007 --> 00:46:48.129]  We now live in the paradox where it's all happening, but the system has such disdain, they say it's not happening.
[00:46:48.129 --> 00:46:50.209]  Like they're a magician and they've hypnotized people.
[00:46:50.209 --> 00:46:57.351]  I mean, it'd be so easy just to wake up, see what they're doing, the little man behind the curtain.
[00:46:57.351 --> 00:47:02.412]  Now, the reason I get into that is this one line has been a talking point for about three years, and I figured it out.
[00:47:02.412 --> 00:47:04.013]  They're really scared of this.
[00:47:04.932 --> 00:47:08.876]  Because their big enchilada is the hormonal manipulation.
[00:47:08.876 --> 00:47:11.779]  They've got electrical going on as well.
[00:47:11.779 --> 00:47:14.201]  Dr. Baggage breaks that down.
[00:47:14.201 --> 00:47:28.275]  But this hormonal agenda is everywhere in their literature and it's everywhere in the products, in the printer ink, in the tin can linings, in the Coke can linings, in the Pepsi can linings, in the juice box linings.
[00:47:28.275 --> 00:47:29.216]  It's everywhere.
[00:47:30.330 --> 00:47:33.592]  And that's why men are feminized.
[00:47:33.592 --> 00:47:35.933]  That's why breast cancer is off the charts.
[00:47:35.933 --> 00:47:36.954]  One of the big drivers.
[00:47:36.954 --> 00:47:37.414]  The U.S.
[00:47:37.414 --> 00:47:39.195]  is number one in the world and growing.
[00:47:39.195 --> 00:47:44.158]  And there's never a discussion about how do we... Why is it increasing?
[00:47:44.158 --> 00:47:46.719]  What's causing breast cancer to go off the charts?
[00:47:46.719 --> 00:47:51.882]  What's causing lung cancer to go off the charts even though smoking in the last 30 years has reduced?
[00:47:51.882 --> 00:47:55.645]  What's causing obesity to go up even though people are actually eating less than they did 50 years ago?
[00:47:55.645 --> 00:47:56.025]  Do you know that?
[00:47:56.886 --> 00:47:59.028]  What is causing all of this?
[00:47:59.028 --> 00:48:02.230]  And it's because it's the additives, folks.
[00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:04.632]  And it's not just to make it taste good.
[00:48:04.632 --> 00:48:07.814]  It's there to addict you.
[00:48:07.814 --> 00:48:11.637]  This is a chemical warfare attack.
[00:48:11.637 --> 00:48:13.639]  It's a brave new world.
[00:48:13.639 --> 00:48:17.722]  But they don't have you like THX1138 line up for your government-dosed drugs every day.
[00:48:17.722 --> 00:48:19.063]  They do that with the kids now.
[00:48:19.063 --> 00:48:20.344]  That's the major plan.
[00:48:20.344 --> 00:48:21.785]  It's in everything.
[00:48:24.457 --> 00:48:29.343]  And so here is CBS News and hundreds of other publications last week and this week.
[00:48:29.343 --> 00:48:32.806]  Let me have a document cam shot please.
[00:48:32.806 --> 00:48:41.076]  Going over this and saying Alex says the government's putting stuff in the water to make people gay.
[00:48:41.076 --> 00:48:43.378]  And of course they don't get into
[00:48:44.963 --> 00:48:50.988]  The facts here of my original reports that they boil down to something that sounds silly.
[00:48:50.988 --> 00:49:06.943]  Here is a memorandum, this is on record, this is the Library of Congress, to the World Population Council, the Population Council, the Global Planned Parenthood, from the head of Planned Parenthood, 1969, and published to the full group in 1970.
[00:49:09.935 --> 00:49:14.560]  And they say, to reduce population, encourage increased homosexuality.
[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:16.161]  You see that right there?
[00:49:16.161 --> 00:49:19.945]  Zoom in even more for him, please.
[00:49:19.945 --> 00:49:26.431]  Increased... Encourage increased homosexuality.
[00:49:26.431 --> 00:49:26.791]  You see that?
[00:49:27.830 --> 00:49:31.992]  You see, this isn't some moral judgment about what somebody does sexually.
[00:49:31.992 --> 00:49:35.194]  This is the point that men have lower sperm counts.
[00:49:35.194 --> 00:49:36.315]  This is science.
[00:49:36.315 --> 00:49:38.356]  Men have higher estrogen.
[00:49:38.356 --> 00:49:41.698]  Men's genitalia size in the last few decades has gotten smaller.
[00:49:41.698 --> 00:49:43.379]  All these studies are out there.
[00:49:43.379 --> 00:49:47.021]  Men's cancer is increasing just from bisphenol A alone.
[00:49:47.021 --> 00:49:47.501]  And guess what?
[00:49:47.501 --> 00:49:50.123]  That's only one of many.
[00:49:50.123 --> 00:49:52.844]  Fertility control agents in water supply.
[00:49:52.844 --> 00:49:53.685]  That's the next point.
[00:49:55.407 --> 00:49:59.032]  What does the White House Science Czar call for in two books he's written?
[00:49:59.032 --> 00:50:01.214]  Ecoscience and others.
[00:50:01.214 --> 00:50:03.557]  Putting stuff in the water to sterilize you.
[00:50:03.557 --> 00:50:06.041]  Look at the sperm count dropping.
[00:50:06.041 --> 00:50:11.928]  And then you say, yeah, but... Look at the so-called minority population exploding.
[00:50:11.928 --> 00:50:13.170]  They say they're going after those folks.
[00:50:14.577 --> 00:50:17.178]  Some people are racist and think that's a good idea.
[00:50:17.178 --> 00:50:22.419]  When you get deeper into eugenics, they're actually targeting groups that are seen as more intelligent.
[00:50:22.419 --> 00:50:24.320]  They want to wipe out their competition.
[00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:30.441]  Just like a grizzly bear will eat male cubs, or a lion will eat male cubs.
[00:50:30.441 --> 00:50:38.244]  Sometimes male whales will go and hold a baby male under until they die.
[00:50:38.244 --> 00:50:39.464]  That's what's really going on.
[00:50:41.578 --> 00:50:43.781]  That's who they're really targeting in their own manuals.
[00:50:43.781 --> 00:50:45.643]  And I have the manuals right here.
[00:50:45.643 --> 00:50:50.309]  Children that show high intelligence that are males and aggressive and won't be followers?
[00:50:50.309 --> 00:50:52.051]  Brain damage them!
[00:50:52.051 --> 00:50:53.433]  And that's what they do.
[00:50:53.433 --> 00:50:55.516]  And it is the ultimate sick society.
[00:50:55.516 --> 00:50:57.358]  We're going to read more of these documents.
[00:50:57.358 --> 00:50:57.859]  Straight ahead.
[00:50:57.859 --> 00:50:58.280]  Stay with us.
[00:51:03.143 --> 00:51:07.608]  Folks, have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on?
[00:51:07.608 --> 00:51:10.971]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[00:51:10.971 --> 00:51:15.355]  Because there's never been a better time to get ready for the winter power outages ahead.
[00:51:15.355 --> 00:51:16.356]  Here's why.
[00:51:16.356 --> 00:51:22.502]  Solar power generators are now available from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[00:51:22.502 --> 00:51:26.987]  Their emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[00:51:27.347 --> 00:51:33.711]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity from the sun.
[00:51:33.711 --> 00:51:37.574]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:51:37.574 --> 00:51:43.518]  Whether it's ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[00:51:43.518 --> 00:51:49.142]  When the power goes out this winter, you'll be ready with a solar-powered generator from Solutions from Science.
[00:51:49.142 --> 00:51:52.144]  Go to MySolarBackup.com for more information.
[00:51:52.144 --> 00:51:54.405]  That's MySolarBackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[00:52:00.289 --> 00:52:06.153]  There are limitless ways to go into business for yourself, but most involve substantial capital and risk.

[00:52:40.326 --> 00:52:41.366]  Want to find out more?

[00:52:57.165 --> 00:52:59.650]  Whatever you do, visit Infowarsteam.com.
[00:53:00.171 --> 00:53:05.395]  We all know that Berkey Water Purification Systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:54:25.942 --> 00:54:28.543]  So, here's the deal.
[00:54:28.543 --> 00:54:32.065]  Ron Paul's great and I support him.
[00:54:32.065 --> 00:54:36.066]  It's, you know, interesting to talk about how horrible Newt Gingrich is and Mitt Romney.
[00:54:36.066 --> 00:54:39.348]  But they're all just window dressing.
[00:54:39.348 --> 00:54:42.809]  Ron Paul isn't window dressing, that's why they're coming after him.
[00:54:42.809 --> 00:54:46.971]  But Ron Paul himself is just a doorway into reality.
[00:54:46.971 --> 00:54:49.292]  The rabbit hole goes a lot deeper.
[00:54:50.282 --> 00:54:57.045]  I mean, Ron Paul's being criticized for, in one of those newsletters, talking about, you know, could governments have been involved?
[00:54:57.045 --> 00:55:02.888]  And he reportedly wrote, you know, one of his Jewish friends told him he thought Israel was behind it.
[00:55:02.888 --> 00:55:08.150]  Well, I mean, it was in the New York Times and CBS News that the FBI ran the whole thing.
[00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:11.712]  We know the names, we have the recordings of it.
[00:55:11.712 --> 00:55:16.534]  It's public, but again, that's a conspiracy theory, to have New York Times, CBS News.
[00:55:19.542 --> 00:55:21.764]  It's on record.
[00:55:21.764 --> 00:55:25.667]  It's in my film, Road to Tyranny.
[00:55:25.667 --> 00:55:30.091]  And so I'm here, and I've got, look at all these documents.
[00:55:30.091 --> 00:55:36.296]  For folks that are watching us on PrisonPlanet.tv, if you're listening on the radio, the next few days, we're going to do a whole report.
[00:55:36.296 --> 00:55:37.737]  We've already shot the report.
[00:55:37.737 --> 00:55:38.738]  It's being put together right now.
[00:55:38.738 --> 00:55:42.021]  It'll be on YouTube and everywhere else for everybody to see it.
[00:55:42.021 --> 00:55:46.585]  For those that can't see, I've got about 50 documents or so here.
[00:55:47.918 --> 00:55:53.802]  Government documents, I've got UN, UNESCO documents here about destroying the family.
[00:55:53.802 --> 00:56:01.367]  This is taught in the entire Western world when your government is signed on to UNESCO.
[00:56:01.367 --> 00:56:02.208]  We'll show people right here.
[00:56:02.208 --> 00:56:10.554]  When you're signed on to the UN and you're signed on to UNESCO, this is in teacher training.
[00:56:13.388 --> 00:56:34.751]  And it says UNESCO initially attempted to impose its international curriculum to prepare students for world government in 1949 using a 10-part series teachers titled Towards World Understanding, which stated one of the chief aims of education today should be prepare boys and girls to take active part in the creation of a world society.
[00:56:35.592 --> 00:56:48.715]  It also stated, I'm quoting, as long as the child breathes the poison air of nationalism, they say the same thing about the family, education and world mindedness can produce only precarious results.
[00:56:48.715 --> 00:56:54.576]  As we have pointed out, it is frequently the family that infects the child with extreme nationalism.
[00:56:54.576 --> 00:57:00.817]  The school should therefore use the means described earlier to combat family attitudes that favor jingoism.
[00:57:00.817 --> 00:57:00.957]  Now,
[00:57:01.926 --> 00:57:08.336]  This is the corporate global government wants to get rid of your government because it's a firewall to them.
[00:57:08.336 --> 00:57:12.041]  In case they can't fully take it over like they've done the US government.
[00:57:12.041 --> 00:57:12.823]  And it goes through it all.
[00:57:14.602 --> 00:57:33.232]  But here is Planned Parenthood in a report for the Population Council that advises the UN, and you notice this was implemented in China, compulsory abortion of out-of-wedlock pregnancies, compulsory sterilization of all who have had two children, payments to encourage abortion.
[00:57:33.232 --> 00:57:37.654]  In Travis County, where I live, they make, well, now I moved out of Travis County, actually.
[00:57:37.654 --> 00:57:42.257]  Point is, you pay taxes to pay for abortions.
[00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:48.742]  Discouragement of private home ownership.
[00:57:48.742 --> 00:57:49.943]  They've got other lines in here.
[00:57:49.943 --> 00:57:56.346]  Eliminate welfare payments for first two children.
[00:57:56.346 --> 00:57:59.928]  And it goes on to here to say, encourage women to work.
[00:57:59.928 --> 00:58:00.728]  Read this right here.
[00:58:00.728 --> 00:58:04.570]  Encourage women to work.
[00:58:04.570 --> 00:58:05.671]  Gloria Steinem, Ms.
[00:58:05.671 --> 00:58:11.414]  Magazine, on record, CIA, not to empower women, but to make the state
[00:58:12.657 --> 00:58:13.878]  They're pimp.
[00:58:13.878 --> 00:58:16.620]  So they're working full time so the state gets the kids.
[00:58:16.620 --> 00:58:17.721]  So the house is a mess.
[00:58:17.721 --> 00:58:19.182]  Everything falls apart.
[00:58:19.182 --> 00:58:20.723]  So the kids get on drugs.
[00:58:20.723 --> 00:58:24.506]  So the state can be the mommy and daddy and brainwash the kids and turn them against them.
[00:58:24.506 --> 00:58:26.187]  Here it is!
[00:58:26.187 --> 00:58:27.808]  Just what we saw in Soviet Russia.
[00:58:27.808 --> 00:58:28.489]  In Cuba.
[00:58:28.489 --> 00:58:29.530]  In Communist China.
[00:58:29.530 --> 00:58:30.931]  And it's our government.
[00:58:30.931 --> 00:58:33.292]  And it's the UN pushing it.
[00:58:33.292 --> 00:58:35.954]  Because the corporations can't have families.
[00:58:35.954 --> 00:58:38.957]  They want a bunch of mindless, programmable idiots.
[00:58:43.326 --> 00:58:51.671]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:51.671 --> 00:58:53.391]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:53.391 --> 00:58:58.694]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:58:58.694 --> 00:59:00.235]  Saving means to make money.
[00:59:00.235 --> 00:59:09.020]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:59:09.740 --> 00:59:17.287]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:59:17.287 --> 00:59:25.295]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:59:25.295 --> 00:59:30.519]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[00:59:30.519 --> 00:59:32.702]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[00:59:53.492 --> 00:59:55.873]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.873 --> 00:59:58.655]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.290 --> 01:00:10.131]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.131 --> 01:00:11.711]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.711 --> 01:00:13.252]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.252 --> 01:00:17.433]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.433 --> 01:00:21.533]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:31.658 --> 01:00:34.439]  Look, the system wants you docile.
[01:00:34.439 --> 01:00:50.003]  The reason a lot of people can't get angry is because the additives in the food and water have rendered you down into basically flaccid, jellyfish-like, little servile drones.
[01:00:50.003 --> 01:00:53.744]  Myself included!
[01:00:53.744 --> 01:00:56.664]  And that's why men aren't men, women aren't women.
[01:00:56.664 --> 01:00:58.825]  People say, what ever happened to the day when men were
[01:01:00.219 --> 01:01:05.201]  You know, men, women were women, cars were cars, whatever happened to that?
[01:01:05.201 --> 01:01:07.481]  It's called living under a eugenic system.
[01:01:07.481 --> 01:01:23.747]  In fact, Aaron just ran in here during the break and he said, you know, in my article I wrote last week about China taking the children and the property of people that have more than two children, I put a link to US government training videos from the 70s in China.
[01:01:25.427 --> 01:01:34.112]  Where it shows an inspector that comes by and makes sure that the women are on their menstrual cycles, and makes sure they take their birth control pills.
[01:01:34.112 --> 01:01:35.332]  Little inspectors.
[01:01:35.332 --> 01:01:40.135]  I mean, everything in this 1969 plan was implemented in China as the model.
[01:01:40.655 --> 01:01:47.182]  And they told that dictatorship, we'll give you all this power and move everything to your country if you'll be the model.
[01:01:47.182 --> 01:01:55.491]  And then using your giant workforce, you will be able to leverage the whole world to accept this new system through economic warfare.
[01:01:55.491 --> 01:01:57.212]  This is the heart of it.
[01:01:57.212 --> 01:01:59.395]  And I get up here with detailed reports.
[01:02:00.914 --> 01:02:05.416]  About breast cancer, several thousand percentage point increase the last 50 years.
[01:02:05.416 --> 01:02:11.198]  The highest in the world in the US and it follows according to the industrialization, the bisphenol and the rest of it.
[01:02:11.198 --> 01:02:17.761]  And I get up here and I show the reports where they want to encourage homosexuality so you don't have families and
[01:02:19.042 --> 01:02:25.087]  You see the TV messages making fun of families, making fun of kids, making fun of people that have children.
[01:02:25.087 --> 01:02:27.369]  We're the ones under attack.
[01:02:27.369 --> 01:02:33.813]  It's the establishment that's bigoted against us in a cold system to get rid of the family.
[01:02:33.813 --> 01:02:38.977]  And then they add chemicals to the food and water and the printer ink, the bisphenol A to do this.
[01:02:38.977 --> 01:02:41.099]  Here's more of the documents.
[01:02:41.099 --> 01:02:42.640]  Encourage women to work.
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:44.522]  And then we have all the different documents.
[01:02:44.522 --> 01:02:48.525]  Mission Magazine, CIA, all about breaking up the family.
[01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:50.891]  And then look where women are today.
[01:02:50.891 --> 01:02:52.071]  Totally unhappy.
[01:02:52.071 --> 01:02:57.194]  Turned into absolute sexual objects like they've never been before.
[01:02:57.194 --> 01:03:03.098]  Now I'm going to go through some more of these documents.
[01:03:03.098 --> 01:03:03.518]  Look at this one.
[01:03:03.518 --> 01:03:06.700]  Monsanto GMO corn linked to organ failure and sterility.
[01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:10.402]  International Journal of Bioethical Sciences.
[01:03:10.402 --> 01:03:16.406]  Here's people rioting for women's face slash men beaten and robbed for Air Jordans.
[01:03:16.406 --> 01:03:17.907]  We'll zoom in on some of these documents here.
[01:03:18.974 --> 01:03:30.343]  FDA faulted for stance on chemical in plastics.
[01:03:30.343 --> 01:03:31.484]  Is that camera going closer?
[01:03:31.484 --> 01:03:37.409]  FDA faulted for stance on chemical plastics.
[01:03:37.409 --> 01:03:44.015]  Again, this is four years ago when they were trying to bamboozle the public and not at least admit that it's sterilizing people and a carcinogen.
[01:03:48.291 --> 01:03:48.991]  Here's another one.
[01:03:48.991 --> 01:03:59.335]  Synthetic estrogen BPA coats cash receipts, cash register receipts, and then it gets into the chemical being 30% higher in retail workers.
[01:03:59.335 --> 01:04:03.297]  That's linked to a report from the Centers for Disease Control.
[01:04:03.297 --> 01:04:05.978]  In fact, here's that Centers for Disease Control report.
[01:04:06.758 --> 01:04:08.018]  And you know what CBS does?
[01:04:08.018 --> 01:04:09.999]  They just say, conspiracy theory.
[01:04:09.999 --> 01:04:12.399]  Show one of it increases cancer massively.
[01:04:12.399 --> 01:04:24.763]  Show one of it lowers your testosterone and turns men into feminine creatures and hyper-feminizes women and burns out their sexual tissues.
[01:04:24.763 --> 01:04:27.763]  But it didn't stop the truth from happening and coming out.
[01:04:27.763 --> 01:04:32.745]  In October of 2010, Canada declares BPA toxic.
[01:04:32.745 --> 01:04:34.165]  Moved towards bans on it.
[01:04:36.127 --> 01:04:37.248]  So that's just some of it.
[01:04:37.248 --> 01:04:39.350]  We're going to go to break.
[01:04:39.350 --> 01:04:42.133]  We're going to come back with Dr. Busby and look at Fukushima.
[01:04:42.133 --> 01:04:44.556]  And then we've got Lindsey Williams coming up today.
[01:04:44.556 --> 01:04:47.118]  But this stuff needs to upset you.
[01:04:47.118 --> 01:04:48.540]  We need to get angry.
[01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:53.245]  We need to make this the major issue because it's so outrageous.
[01:04:53.245 --> 01:04:57.529]  If people just get the facts and get the word out, these globalists will fall.
[01:04:57.529 --> 01:04:58.850]  People got to face the horror though.
[01:05:01.835 --> 01:05:05.859]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:05:05.859 --> 01:05:09.103]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:05:09.103 --> 01:05:13.908]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:05:13.908 --> 01:05:20.295]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:05:20.295 --> 01:05:22.538]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:05:23.058 --> 01:05:23.358]  Tim Geithner?
[01:05:23.358 --> 01:05:23.638]  Bernanke?
[01:05:23.638 --> 01:05:24.058]  They're arsonists!
[01:05:24.058 --> 01:05:24.838]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:05:24.838 --> 01:05:26.279]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:05:41.963 --> 01:05:49.246]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:05:49.246 --> 01:05:58.369]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:06:00.498 --> 01:06:02.039]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:06:02.039 --> 01:06:08.343]  This holiday season, more than half of our nation is in need of help due to the shattered economy.
[01:06:08.343 --> 01:06:12.386]  So now is the time to express the holiday spirit more than ever.
[01:06:12.386 --> 01:06:21.972]  Consider helping those you love with the most important gift, a supply of delicious, easy to fix, and very storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.
[01:06:21.972 --> 01:06:30.378]  Their holiday gift and family pack start at $99 for a 16-day supply, while their 5-week supply of quick and easy to fix meals
[01:06:30.418 --> 01:06:32.439]  That's 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:06:32.439 --> 01:06:33.659]  You can bet your life on eFoods Direct.
[01:07:01.365 --> 01:07:03.066]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:07:03.066 --> 01:07:08.368]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:07:08.368 --> 01:07:09.908]  Saving means to make money.
[01:07:09.908 --> 01:07:18.672]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:07:19.432 --> 01:07:26.959]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:07:26.959 --> 01:07:34.965]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:07:34.965 --> 01:07:40.210]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:07:40.210 --> 01:07:42.372]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:07:45.114 --> 01:07:46.455]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:07:46.455 --> 01:07:48.497]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:09.733 --> 01:08:13.056]  What, two or three years ago there was the big melamine scare?
[01:08:13.056 --> 01:08:15.258]  Thousands of people died in China from it?
[01:08:15.258 --> 01:08:17.500]  Plastic in the milk?
[01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:22.303]  Because the plastic powder can trick the test for the level of protein in it.
[01:08:23.246 --> 01:08:25.368]  And they executed quite a few people for it.
[01:08:25.368 --> 01:08:30.812]  But when that same powdered milk hit the U.S., the FDA came out and said, you know what?
[01:08:30.812 --> 01:08:32.753]  Melamine isn't bad for you.
[01:08:32.753 --> 01:08:35.235]  That's Wall Street Journal, New York Times.
[01:08:35.235 --> 01:08:36.116]  You can pull that up.
[01:08:36.116 --> 01:08:38.217]  FDA says melamine not bad.
[01:08:38.217 --> 01:08:40.539]  It's this magic wand behavior.
[01:08:41.468 --> 01:09:00.646]  And as you know, I don't know, six months or so ago, radioactive isotope levels were going up, and so they would raise the different isotope levels, depending on what isotope went up, from 25 times what it previously was, 25 times that is safe, to in some cases 100,000 times, and that was on the EPA's own website.
[01:09:00.646 --> 01:09:02.148]  And you know, people can laugh at that.
[01:09:03.028 --> 01:09:08.991]  At government getting so delusional that it just waves a wand and says, don't take any precautions.
[01:09:08.991 --> 01:09:10.572]  Go ahead and just eat the food.
[01:09:10.572 --> 01:09:13.494]  You know, back in Chernobyl for six months, they said, don't eat the food.
[01:09:13.494 --> 01:09:16.275]  You know, ship it in from other countries.
[01:09:16.275 --> 01:09:19.417]  Don't drink milk out of Europe.
[01:09:19.417 --> 01:09:28.241]  But when they found higher levels of radiation, in some cases, a hundred times in the milk, they just waved a magic wand and said, let your kids have it.
[01:09:28.241 --> 01:09:29.422]  And they found it in Vermont.
[01:09:29.422 --> 01:09:31.443]  They found it in California, all over the country.
[01:09:32.364 --> 01:09:40.450]  And now all that radioactive waste and the stuff from the tsunami is hitting the West Coast.
[01:09:40.450 --> 01:09:42.151]  Geiger counters are going crazy.
[01:09:42.151 --> 01:09:45.213]  The government says, don't worry, it's not bad for you.
[01:09:45.213 --> 01:09:51.698]  Just like for 50 years they kept secret that big salt reactor out in Simi Valley blowing up.
[01:09:51.698 --> 01:09:55.120]  They kept the total meltdown as big or bigger than Chernobyl secret.
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:56.981]  What else is going on we don't know about?
[01:09:56.981 --> 01:09:59.283]  Suddenly France has had big disasters.
[01:09:59.283 --> 01:10:00.364]  Suddenly in
[01:10:02.102 --> 01:10:05.547]  Other areas of Europe, higher radiation showing up.
[01:10:05.547 --> 01:10:07.530]  Suddenly, Canada's having big leaks.
[01:10:07.530 --> 01:10:15.521]  It's like, all of a sudden, since the magic wand was waved, who knows, maybe they'll store reactors in your basement or something.
[01:10:15.521 --> 01:10:18.526]  And people look at this, they say it's crazy, but look at North Korea.
[01:10:19.730 --> 01:10:23.193]  That's just, and after our guest leaves us in about 30 minutes, I'm going to break this down.
[01:10:23.193 --> 01:10:29.738]  More fake wailing, millions showing up to scream and yell and worship and fake cry.
[01:10:29.738 --> 01:10:34.101]  Because if you don't, you go to a slave labor camp.
[01:10:34.101 --> 01:10:35.202]  I mean, what a joke.
[01:10:35.202 --> 01:10:40.126]  But that's what happens when people buy into delusion and play along with lies.
[01:10:40.126 --> 01:10:43.309]  And that's what our own elite are doing with all of these issues.
[01:10:44.554 --> 01:10:49.138]  Now joining us is Dr. Busby, Christopher Busby.
[01:10:49.138 --> 01:10:50.780]  He is a chemical physicist.
[01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:52.381]  He's advised BBC.
[01:10:52.381 --> 01:10:55.124]  He's advised EU groups.
[01:10:55.124 --> 01:10:59.648]  He's a very respected professor, University of Ulster in Northern Ireland.
[01:10:59.648 --> 01:11:02.651]  And he joins us today.
[01:11:02.651 --> 01:11:05.794]  He's got several websites that publishes peer-reviewed work.
[01:11:05.794 --> 01:11:06.495]  You can look at it there.
[01:11:06.495 --> 01:11:07.956]  But I have to toot his horn.
[01:11:07.956 --> 01:11:09.177]  In fact, having him back on,
[01:11:09.818 --> 01:11:14.100]  We had him on quite a bit when it was getting a lot of attention, and the public would actually listen.
[01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:25.627]  Day one he said, we have these isotope readings, this shows there's been meltdown, those are reactor rods being blown in the sky, this is a cover-up, this is much worse than Chernobyl, and we got criticism when he was on.
[01:11:25.627 --> 01:11:28.748]  People said, oh, this is fear-mongering, it couldn't be true.
[01:11:28.748 --> 01:11:30.870]  Months after, once it wasn't in the news,
[01:11:31.892 --> 01:11:35.033]  Their own top scientists went public, resigned.
[01:11:35.033 --> 01:11:36.414]  Leaders of Japan resigned.
[01:11:36.414 --> 01:11:37.575]  They covered it up.
[01:11:37.575 --> 01:11:41.036]  There's been an exodus out of central Japan to the south.
[01:11:41.036 --> 01:11:43.637]  Even though the government says it's safe, the public isn't stupid.
[01:11:43.637 --> 01:11:47.199]  There's been reported deaths associated with radiation poisoning.
[01:11:47.199 --> 01:11:49.440]  The Fukushima 50 who went in.
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:51.701]  And now it's just out of sight, out of mind.
[01:11:51.701 --> 01:11:52.942]  So giving us a report...
[01:11:54.923 --> 01:12:13.954]  As we prepare to leave this disastrous year 2011, and I'll pull up the date exactly how long ago Fukushima was in a moment, is Dr. Busby to recap what happened and then to explain to us what he thinks may be going on with all these new disasters and where he sees this going in the future.
[01:12:13.954 --> 01:12:15.275]  Dr. Busby, thank you for joining us.
[01:12:15.819 --> 01:12:17.680]  Yes, hello Alex, hi.
[01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:34.852]  Okay, well, I think people in the future looking back at this event in Japan will recognize that this is probably one of the most serious public health accidents, if you like, in the history of the human race.
[01:12:34.852 --> 01:12:45.739]  Huge amounts of radioactivity were released and still contaminate very large parts of northern Japan, and there has been a probe recently by the Japanese government into what happened
[01:12:45.819 --> 01:12:46.920]  We're good to go.
[01:13:06.563 --> 01:13:18.538]  I have to say also that nobody's apologised to me about any of this and there's been a deathly hush about these effects and we learn very little about what's really happening at the reactors even now.
[01:13:18.538 --> 01:13:21.742]  The wrong questions are being asked and no answers are forthcoming.
[01:13:22.867 --> 01:13:31.919]  And then we get Twilight Zone comments by people on London Guardian saying, oh, I'm now for nuclear power because of Fukushima.
[01:13:31.919 --> 01:13:33.641]  It's so wondrous.
[01:13:33.641 --> 01:13:37.206]  And I mean, it's it's so bizarre.
[01:13:37.827 --> 01:13:53.720]  Well that guy George Monbiot, he actually took it into his head to attack me personally from the columns of the Guardian two weeks running and raked out an awful lot of scurrilous nonsense and lies and so on about me personally.
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:14:03.088]  I was quite irritated by all of that and there's not much I can do about it and the Guardian newspaper have refused to, well they haven't allowed me to make any sort of response.
[01:14:03.088 --> 01:14:04.309]  So it seemed to me
[01:14:06.874 --> 01:14:07.355]  I don't know.
[01:14:25.205 --> 01:14:27.166]  For the people who live within it.
[01:14:27.166 --> 01:14:28.826]  You know, it's actually killing people.
[01:14:28.826 --> 01:14:35.529]  The system itself, which is something that you talk about a lot, but I'm absolutely with you there.
[01:14:35.529 --> 01:14:37.809]  The system itself is not sustainable.
[01:14:37.809 --> 01:14:38.990]  It just absolutely isn't.
[01:14:38.990 --> 01:14:51.934]  And something has to be done, not just about nuclear power, but about the whole economic structure of the system and the power structure within it before everybody in the world, you know, just doesn't survive.
[01:14:51.934 --> 01:14:53.155]  It's quite terrifying.
[01:14:53.922 --> 01:14:55.323]  Well, I mean, here's an example.
[01:14:55.323 --> 01:15:00.386]  Thirty years ago, and I've talked to top economists on this subject, the U.S.
[01:15:00.386 --> 01:15:06.169]  and British governments and others gave out pretty accurate economic numbers on unemployment, on inflation.
[01:15:06.169 --> 01:15:08.370]  Now they just put out completely fake numbers.
[01:15:08.370 --> 01:15:12.013]  They say unemployment's 8.9, it's really 22-plus.
[01:15:12.013 --> 01:15:13.914]  They say inflation's 3%, it's really 11 or more.
[01:15:16.555 --> 01:15:23.797]  I mean, it's almost an insanity by the ruling class now, where their children are breathing this radiation.
[01:15:23.797 --> 01:15:35.201]  I mean, in Chernobyl in 86, they made a real effort, as you know, to keep people from eating the food and drinking the milk for at least six months, to mitigate some of it.
[01:15:35.201 --> 01:15:36.421]  Now there's not even an attempt!
[01:15:37.654 --> 01:15:38.415]  Yes, that's right.
[01:15:38.415 --> 01:15:54.226]  The Soviets, although everyone at the beginning of this Fukushima catastrophe were talking about how it wasn't anything like Chernobyl, actually the Soviet authorities evacuated people from Chernobyl very quickly and they really did do their best.
[01:15:54.226 --> 01:16:00.771]  What we see here is an almost totally cynical and criminal
[01:16:03.874 --> 01:16:04.875]  We're good to go.
[01:16:28.064 --> 01:16:28.764]  You've really put a...
[01:16:55.689 --> 01:17:17.271]  A good verbal description of it, of something that is indescribably insane, but breaking down the real history which they now admit, for those that don't know because it's been buried, what really happened if we go back to the tsunami, March 11th, 9, almost 10 months ago, 2011, what really happened with those six reactors?
[01:17:19.926 --> 01:17:22.127]  We can tell what happened with this.
[01:17:22.127 --> 01:17:31.990]  There was an enormously powerful earthquake, and the earthquake caused damage to the reactors before the tsunami hit.
[01:17:31.990 --> 01:17:42.394]  And this damaged the reactors, cut off the cooling supply to the reactors, and so of course they started to melt, they started to boil, and the water boiled away, and then the rods started to melt down.
[01:17:42.394 --> 01:17:44.335]  Now, the story is that in fact,
[01:17:45.556 --> 01:17:52.183]  They went into cold shutdown automatically at the time of the earthquake.
[01:17:52.183 --> 01:18:00.933]  And then what happened was that the backup generators, the systems that were supposed to continue to provide cooling, were wiped out by the water from the tsunami.
[01:18:02.370 --> 01:18:16.599]  It actually really doesn't matter that much which of those is correct, because what then happened was that there were, in my opinion, nuclear explosions and hydrogen explosions, which effectively destroyed most of those reactors in the first week.
[01:18:16.599 --> 01:18:24.404]  And we can tell that from levels of radioactivity that were measured in various detectors quite far to the south of Tokyo.
[01:18:24.404 --> 01:18:27.026]  You can see the levels of radiation increasing
[01:18:27.626 --> 01:18:28.326]  We're good.
[01:18:45.174 --> 01:18:45.794]  We're good to go.
[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:32.586]  And by the way, I've had people on the show who aren't physicists, and they just say, oh, that's impossible, but I've talked to other physicists, and they say no, that things can purify out into levels, and that you can get smaller explosions, and here you are, you know, you're an acclaimed physicist, you're saying this can happen, but the media went along with it and said that can't happen.
[01:19:32.586 --> 01:19:38.648]  No, I know they said it couldn't happen, but there was a very famous British physicist who talked about the famous

[01:24:06.488 --> 01:24:12.296]  Alright, we've got our guest for this segment and part of the next that I'm getting into.
[01:24:12.296 --> 01:24:19.346]  The latest on Ron Paul, North Korea, the Iran situation, the economy, it is all coming up.
[01:24:19.346 --> 01:24:20.968]  And then we've got joining us...
[01:24:22.304 --> 01:24:27.011]  Lindsey Williams, and we'll take phone calls while he's on with us, by the way.
[01:24:27.011 --> 01:24:32.258]  Dr. Busby, you were getting into how nuclear explosions can take place.
[01:24:32.258 --> 01:24:39.128]  And of course, after you first reported this, they did pick up the isotopes that they had to admit only happened during those type of explosions.
[01:24:40.692 --> 01:24:46.934]  We still don't know exactly what the concentrations of the isotopes are that would enable us to tell the kind of explosion that occurred.
[01:24:46.934 --> 01:24:56.618]  But my point that I would make is this, is that actually you have, at least in the reactor where I think there was a nuclear explosion, you have plutonium and uranium mixed together.
[01:24:56.618 --> 01:25:01.220]  Now if the temperature gets high enough, then what happens is that one of those will distill off at a different temperature.
[01:25:01.340 --> 01:25:02.000]  We're good to go.
[01:25:29.625 --> 01:25:34.208]  And you've also got explosions going on around it that could be the precursor explosion.
[01:25:34.208 --> 01:25:39.711]  There's an awful lot that we don't know about what goes on in these sort of situations.
[01:25:39.711 --> 01:25:42.033]  And I think the fact is that the scientists don't either.
[01:25:42.033 --> 01:25:44.274]  And this brings me to a point that I would like to quickly make.
[01:25:46.604 --> 01:25:46.944]  Chaos Theory!
[01:26:03.447 --> 01:26:05.448]  Absolutely, all sorts of stuff.
[01:26:05.448 --> 01:26:08.628]  I mean, just remember that physicists have lost 95% of the universe.
[01:26:08.628 --> 01:26:09.649]  They call it dark matter.
[01:26:09.649 --> 01:26:10.829]  They don't know what it is.
[01:26:10.829 --> 01:26:17.431]  So whether we should believe physicists or not when they talk to us about nuclear power stations and all their calculations is a very interesting question.
[01:26:17.431 --> 01:26:20.592]  Well, they've proven from... What there is in the universe.
[01:26:20.592 --> 01:26:32.555]  Sure, as you know, Doctor, there's now been Nobel Prizes handed out proving that when you have these black holes, you have these quasars, you have these exploding suns, that they're finding that the energy isn't there for that and that it is dark matter.
[01:26:33.732 --> 01:26:37.054]  I think so, but dark matter's a bit like just invoking a demon, you know?
[01:26:37.054 --> 01:26:43.578]  You put together a whole load of equations and you say, this will give us the answer, and you find it only gives you 5% of the answer.
[01:26:43.578 --> 01:26:45.540]  You say, well, the rest of it is a demon.
[01:26:45.540 --> 01:26:51.824]  Well, I know you call it dark matter, but it's not a lot different from Holy Mother Church at the time of Galileo, as far as I can see.
[01:26:53.314 --> 01:26:59.822]  Yeah, man has got a lot of high-tech technologies but doesn't even understand most of what's connected to it.
[01:26:59.822 --> 01:27:00.763]  I think that's true.
[01:27:00.763 --> 01:27:09.733]  I think that the last century was the century of the physicists and it's about time we moved away from that and realized that physics is a very powerful tool.
[01:27:10.273 --> 01:27:17.119]  Well, I've seen reports in Japan, though, that people are dying who work there, but they're always saying something else did it.
[01:27:43.072 --> 01:27:43.792]  We're good to go.
[01:28:04.224 --> 01:28:13.081]  That's exactly what we found in Chernobyl, because the cesium gets into the heart muscle, and it destroys heart muscle, and when a certain amount of heart muscle is gone, the heart is no longer viable.
[01:28:13.081 --> 01:28:14.483]  Then you get a heart attack and die.
[01:28:15.811 --> 01:28:16.392]  Incredible.
[01:28:16.392 --> 01:28:19.975]  You know, I wanted to get you back on to give us the latest on Fukushima.
[01:28:19.975 --> 01:28:25.861]  I didn't even know you had a book out, but when we come back from break, please, I want people to get it and read it and pass it on to friends.
[01:28:25.861 --> 01:28:28.304]  So we'll definitely talk about the book when we come back.
[01:28:28.304 --> 01:28:30.826]  We're about to go to break, but what's the latest?
[01:28:30.826 --> 01:28:35.551]  Because they're claiming that they've stabilized Fukushima, but we've heard this quite a bit in the last nine months.
[01:28:37.227 --> 01:28:38.267]  Of course, manipulation.
[01:28:38.267 --> 01:28:43.249]  I mean, stabilised means that it's not any worse than it was when they stabilised it.
[01:28:43.249 --> 01:28:46.430]  But if by that they're somehow saying it's safe, they're wrong.
[01:28:46.430 --> 01:28:55.072]  I mean, we know that the xenon isotopes are coming out in the last month that show, very short half-life isotopes, that show that it's continuing to fission.
[01:28:55.072 --> 01:29:01.054]  And I think it's pretty certain that the fuel is molten and it's gone through the reactor pressure vessel and it's in the ground.
[01:29:01.054 --> 01:29:05.115]  And Russia today are telling me that there have been cracks in the ground and steam is coming out and so on.
[01:29:05.595 --> 01:29:16.184]  So we're talking about a very serious situation in which they're just trying to downplay because they want to limit the damage that it's going to cause to the development of nuclear power worldwide.
[01:29:16.184 --> 01:29:22.029]  Well, all I know is they've got a history of covering this stuff up and it's not safe.
[01:29:22.029 --> 01:29:23.530]  Well, you're right there.
[01:29:23.530 --> 01:29:24.331]  You're right there.
[01:29:24.331 --> 01:29:26.412]  And that's continuing that history.
[01:29:26.412 --> 01:29:29.095]  Well, and I wouldn't all just blame it on physicists.
[01:29:29.095 --> 01:29:32.598]  I mean, obviously you're a physicist so you can talk about your own discipline, but look.
[01:29:34.107 --> 01:29:42.032]  25 years ago they said never use DU in war, it's deadly, it blows back, it's a soft kill weapon, a delayed kill, you can't use it.
[01:29:42.032 --> 01:29:44.194]  And in 91 they just said we're gonna use it.
[01:29:44.194 --> 01:29:46.775]  And now they just say it's good for the troops.
[01:29:46.775 --> 01:29:50.038]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:50.038 --> 01:29:53.960]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:56.642]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.762 --> 01:30:02.082]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:30:02.082 --> 01:30:07.664]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:30:07.664 --> 01:30:12.686]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:30:12.686 --> 01:30:17.708]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:30:18.248 --> 01:30:23.472]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:30:23.472 --> 01:30:25.793]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:30:25.793 --> 01:30:30.596]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:30:30.596 --> 01:30:31.717]  And here's the best part.
[01:30:31.717 --> 01:30:34.779]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:30:34.779 --> 01:30:38.402]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:30:38.402 --> 01:30:41.584]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:30:41.584 --> 01:30:43.825]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:30:43.825 --> 01:30:44.746]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:30:48.368 --> 01:30:49.809]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:30:49.809 --> 01:30:57.434]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:30:57.434 --> 01:31:01.296]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:31:01.296 --> 01:31:15.745]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:31:16.758 --> 01:31:21.460]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:21.460 --> 01:31:34.226]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:31:34.226 --> 01:31:41.490]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:31:42.170 --> 01:31:52.562]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[01:31:52.562 --> 01:31:56.487]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[01:31:56.487 --> 01:31:59.590]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[01:32:00.290 --> 01:32:01.871]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:32:01.871 --> 01:32:08.176]  This holiday season, more than half of our nation is in need of help due to the shattered economy.
[01:32:08.176 --> 01:32:12.219]  So now is the time to express the holiday spirit more than ever.
[01:32:12.219 --> 01:32:15.782]  Consider helping those you love with the most important gift.
[01:32:15.782 --> 01:32:21.807]  A supply of delicious, easy to fix, and very storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.

[01:32:40.357 --> 01:32:42.578]  Call eFoods today at 800-409-5633 or visit them online.
[01:32:46.260 --> 01:32:48.462]  What we've got here is failure to communicate.
[01:32:48.462 --> 01:32:49.803]  Some men you just can't reach.
[01:33:12.788 --> 01:33:18.038]  So you get what we had here last week, which is the way he wants it.
[01:33:18.038 --> 01:33:20.302]  Well, he gets it.
[01:33:20.302 --> 01:33:23.128]  I don't like it any older.
[01:33:32.259 --> 01:33:42.104]  Okay, we're going to spend another 10 minutes or so with Dr. Busby, then I'm getting into more of the world news, and then we're going to get our next guest on and open the phones up for Lindsey Williams.
[01:33:42.104 --> 01:33:50.128]  I promise to get him back to take your calls and recap what his big oil company exec source has been telling him that's turning out to be very, very accurate.
[01:33:50.128 --> 01:33:56.331]  Remember about a year and a half ago, he said they were going to destabilize the Middle East and launch a big war, but then next it would be China.
[01:33:56.331 --> 01:33:57.671]  First Iran, then China.
[01:33:57.671 --> 01:34:00.493]  We're going to get into all that coming up with Lindsey Williams.
[01:34:01.733 --> 01:34:02.593]  Author Lindsey Williams.
[01:34:02.593 --> 01:34:11.397]  Going back to Dr. Christopher Busby, who's a chemical physicist and a leading expert on the effects of radiation on humans, studying Chernobyl and other events.
[01:34:11.397 --> 01:34:18.540]  He was the one that first said this is much bigger than Chernobyl, and now they admit it's many, many, many Chernobyls, but the response is different.
[01:34:18.540 --> 01:34:19.221]  But during the break,
[01:34:20.253 --> 01:34:23.937]  We were discussing why the ruling class is so insane.
[01:34:23.937 --> 01:34:29.423]  And then Dr. Busby, you know, was getting into that he doesn't believe in aliens.
[01:34:29.423 --> 01:34:35.229]  But one would just say it's almost like aliens wanted to destroy the Earth or change the habitat.
[01:34:35.229 --> 01:34:39.374]  But then he expanded and said, but it's more of just an out of control system.
[01:34:39.374 --> 01:34:40.995]  And I said, yeah, like Richard Nixon.
[01:34:41.716 --> 01:34:46.318]  Talked about the fact that it was like a wild beast, a machine, an animal.
[01:34:46.318 --> 01:34:54.820]  The whole system and the sum of our actions that we don't even see as bad adds to this giant machine.
[01:34:54.820 --> 01:34:57.061]  I mean, take GMO.
[01:34:57.061 --> 01:35:01.643]  Every major study, organ failure in the mice, the rats, infertility.
[01:35:01.643 --> 01:35:05.424]  But their science shows it does have this effect that bugs won't eat it.
[01:35:06.304 --> 01:35:09.427]  And so, so what if it does this?
[01:35:09.427 --> 01:35:14.752]  Because the mathematics say we've changed this trait, so what if it changes all these other traits?
[01:35:14.752 --> 01:35:26.522]  And, as I said going to break, the craziness is intensifying where I've had Dr. physicist, chemist in his own right, Dr. Doug Rocky on.
[01:35:26.522 --> 01:35:31.046]  And their manuals on DU, they had the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s.
[01:35:31.046 --> 01:35:32.547]  And he wrote the manual on it in the early 90s.
[01:35:34.113 --> 01:35:45.819]  Uh, and he's on tomorrow, said DU, you can't use it because it ignites in the barrel of the cannon or the gun, and you breathe it, and it will reduce your life massively.
[01:35:45.819 --> 01:35:46.500]  It will kill you!
[01:35:47.799 --> 01:35:49.220]  And we can't use it.
[01:35:49.220 --> 01:35:55.004]  Well, they had all this stuff stored, and they said in 1990, we're going to go ahead and use it.
[01:35:55.004 --> 01:35:57.106]  But then they still did some decontamination.
[01:35:57.106 --> 01:36:02.430]  Now, they have them at shooting ranges for the military, proving grounds, bases everywhere.
[01:36:02.430 --> 01:36:04.111]  They take it off base.
[01:36:04.111 --> 01:36:05.372]  They use it.
[01:36:05.372 --> 01:36:07.554]  They don't even read manuals now.
[01:36:07.554 --> 01:36:10.276]  So there is a collective insanity
[01:36:11.036 --> 01:36:13.158]  Taking place, and I know you're an expert on D.U.
[01:36:13.158 --> 01:36:26.931]  as well, Dr. Busby, but in the time we've got, tell us about your new book, what you were trying to finish up on Fukushima with this collective craziness, and then these other disasters now popping up that don't even hardly make the news.
[01:36:26.931 --> 01:36:27.592]  What's happening?
[01:36:28.132 --> 01:36:30.773]  Okay, well there are three things you're asking me about here.
[01:36:30.773 --> 01:36:39.435]  The first thing is my new book is called Fukushima and Health, What to Expect, and you can order it from any bookseller or from Green Audit.
[01:36:39.435 --> 01:36:55.299]  And what it does is it takes the whole of the Chernobyl accident and all of the research that was carried out by my colleagues on the European Committee of Radiation Risk, presented at the Third International Conference in Lesvos a few years ago, and it turns that into a book.
[01:36:55.519 --> 01:37:00.985]  I think that's quite an important thing because that tells us all what is going to happen and it's not just cancer.
[01:37:00.985 --> 01:37:05.709]  What we have with radiation and what we've learned in the last 20 years is that these radionuclides actually just reduce lifespan
[01:37:18.462 --> 01:37:19.222]  I think so.
[01:37:39.407 --> 01:37:48.237]  Now your second question was about what's happening now at Fukushima and the answer is we really don't know.
[01:37:48.237 --> 01:37:53.784]  I mean in a sense when they say they've stabilized it, I think probably it's kind of stabilized itself.
[01:37:54.124 --> 01:37:57.066]  I don't think the human beings have had much to do with it really.
[01:37:57.066 --> 01:38:05.432]  It's gone out of the reactor into the ground and it's sort of generally cooled down to the extent that it's not getting vastly worse.
[01:38:05.432 --> 01:38:09.435]  But it is producing lots of radionuclides and they are still coming out of it.
[01:38:09.435 --> 01:38:14.238]  And so that area will be poisoned for hundreds of years in my opinion.
[01:38:14.238 --> 01:38:22.464]  People should not move back there because it's a very dangerous place to be and the contamination all along the coast and in the food is absolutely colossal.
[01:38:23.104 --> 01:38:33.497]  So my advice to the people living there is if they can't get out, then what they should do is they should try and limit the amount of food and milk and water that they ingest.
[01:38:35.922 --> 01:38:37.223]  From that area.
[01:38:37.223 --> 01:38:43.888]  And also I suggested that they take calcium tablets because calcium does actually block the access of strontium-90 and uranium to the DNA.
[01:38:43.888 --> 01:38:44.928]  So that does work.
[01:38:44.928 --> 01:38:49.171]  Plenty of studies were done in the 1960s that show that that's the case.
[01:38:49.171 --> 01:38:52.153]  And you can buy calcium tablets in any health food shop.
[01:38:52.153 --> 01:38:54.835]  So one calcium tablet a day will help.
[01:38:54.835 --> 01:38:57.917]  Now your third question was about the general mess of it all.
[01:39:00.985 --> 01:39:02.266]  Simplest answer to that.
[01:39:02.266 --> 01:39:19.251]  I mean, if we were just as Ande tribesmen and we didn't know any science and we were just looking at the world and trying to figure out what was going on, it would be quite easy to conclude that the world had been taken over by aliens, and these aliens' intention was to change the atmosphere and to kill human beings.
[01:39:19.251 --> 01:39:24.013]  And of course, I mean, that's nonsense really, because that isn't the case.
[01:39:24.013 --> 01:39:26.714]  But in a poetical sense, it maybe is the case, because
[01:39:33.041 --> 01:39:35.426]  I think we're good to go.
[01:39:45.213 --> 01:39:45.953]  We're good to go.
[01:40:12.995 --> 01:40:16.496]  I'm not a nationalist, but actually I think that we have to reduce the size of the units
[01:40:37.412 --> 01:40:40.395]  In order to make the thing more human scale.
[01:40:40.395 --> 01:40:49.565]  These enormous units like the United States of America and Europe and China, they're just too large and too complicated to deal with.
[01:40:49.565 --> 01:40:51.807]  So we have to have smaller units.
[01:40:51.807 --> 01:40:56.773]  Well, freedom normally only works in very small, decentralized systems.
[01:40:57.861 --> 01:41:01.084]  No, I think we need to go back to small nation states.
[01:41:01.084 --> 01:41:05.069]  I think the United States as a unit is too big.
[01:41:05.069 --> 01:41:09.854]  There is a website, I live in Latvia a lot of the time, which is a very
[01:41:12.788 --> 01:41:26.257]  And it's got quite a large land area and quite a small population, and we're trying to set up some kind of national system there that might be possible to form a model for the kind of thing that I'm talking about.
[01:41:26.257 --> 01:41:31.441]  And there's a website called nationalstate.info, which if anybody's interested, they can go and look.
[01:41:31.881 --> 01:41:32.661]  We're good to go.
[01:41:52.728 --> 01:41:54.569]  I think that really is my answer.
[01:41:54.569 --> 01:42:06.935]  That's my kind of message to the planet, really, that the thing is out of control, it's a monster, and we have to sort of separate it up into little items so that we can produce some sort of human-scale response to this.
[01:42:06.935 --> 01:42:08.676]  Otherwise, we are all doomed, in my opinion.
[01:42:09.147 --> 01:42:10.308]  Well, I agree with you.
[01:42:10.308 --> 01:42:26.304]  I mean, just take the DU issue, where their own manuals that we've shown here on air say, do not use it, it's deadly, and then they make a political decision to say, no, it's fine, and commit the military men and women to slow, grueling, horrible, degenerative deaths.
[01:42:27.022 --> 01:42:28.463]  Yeah, and their children, too.
[01:42:28.463 --> 01:42:44.168]  I mean, the study that I've just done has looked at the offspring of the American soldiers in the Gulf War, and there are high levels of congenital malformation in them, as well as the high congenital malformation rates in the Iraqi populations in Fallujah, for example.
[01:42:44.168 --> 01:42:44.748]  Yes.
[01:42:44.748 --> 01:42:46.509]  They're killing your own troops.
[01:42:46.509 --> 01:42:51.591]  Yeah, wasn't Fallujah, even major papers reported, it was 16 times higher than normal birth defects?
[01:42:52.435 --> 01:42:57.958]  That's right, yeah, sure, and up to 38 times the cancer too, so some very serious things happening there.
[01:42:57.958 --> 01:43:01.579]  But you see, again, we come back to this point about the size of the operation.
[01:43:01.579 --> 01:43:10.443]  You see, the United States government, if you like, the Pentagon, they want to win the war.
[01:43:10.443 --> 01:43:14.465]  They want to prevent Saddam Hussein from putting all his oil money into Euros.
[01:43:14.465 --> 01:43:17.827]  So that's their operation, you see, that's the monster operation.
[01:43:18.467 --> 01:43:21.049]  And of course, in order to do that, they have to win the war.
[01:43:21.049 --> 01:43:24.591]  And Saddam had a lot of big tanks, you know, ex-Soviet tanks with armor.
[01:43:24.591 --> 01:43:26.392]  So they had to take out his tanks.
[01:43:26.392 --> 01:43:27.893]  So they used depleted uranium.
[01:43:27.893 --> 01:43:30.415]  And then, of course, as a result of that, everybody suffers.
[01:43:30.415 --> 01:43:35.699]  But, you know, it's a question of what your intention is.
[01:43:35.699 --> 01:43:41.883]  And I think we have to reduce the size of the people who are operating the size of the units.
[01:43:41.883 --> 01:43:43.104]  And that sort of thing wouldn't happen.
[01:43:43.817 --> 01:43:55.926]  Well I agree with you but there was a conscious decision to proliferate this and because they just don't care about the troops and they don't care about themselves.
[01:43:55.926 --> 01:44:10.857]  It is a almost like a mad scramble for all these government contracts and it creates a market for this auction and then in the feeding frenzy kind of like sharks in feeding frenzies
[01:44:12.099 --> 01:44:14.180]  We'll bite and kill each other.
[01:44:14.180 --> 01:44:16.781]  I'll tell you a very interesting thing.
[01:44:16.781 --> 01:44:32.487]  After they discovered the childhood leukemia cluster at Sellafield, which is a big nuclear site in the United Kingdom, there was a Morrie poll where they went and asked all of the workers there, they said, do you think you're likely to have a child with childhood leukemia as a result of what's emerged?
[01:44:32.487 --> 01:44:35.128]  And secondly, they said, would you leave
[01:44:42.278 --> 01:44:42.518]  I think so.
[01:44:57.173 --> 01:44:59.195]  And then more and more people don't care.
[01:44:59.195 --> 01:45:02.799]  I mean, I guess it's the analogy of peeing in the swimming pool.
[01:45:02.799 --> 01:45:11.067]  And if you go to a city pool and there's 500 kids a day in it, it is literally a stinking urine bath.
[01:45:11.067 --> 01:45:13.409]  And there's so much chlorine in it, you can't even swim.
[01:45:13.409 --> 01:45:18.754]  And now the phenomenon of people too lazy and peeing in pools, pools everywhere are ruined.
[01:45:18.754 --> 01:45:20.716]  And it's kind of the same thing.
[01:45:23.976 --> 01:45:25.417]  Yes, yes.
[01:45:25.417 --> 01:45:34.484]  I tell you, it is crazy because, I mean, some job, if my child had a 1% chance of getting cancer higher, I wouldn't take it.
[01:45:34.484 --> 01:45:36.005]  People aren't all the same, are they?
[01:45:36.005 --> 01:45:50.717]  I mean, if you take this idea of childhood leukemia and you compare it with being bitten by a snake in a park, you know, and you said to a mother, look, the probability of your child being bitten by a snake and dying in this park is one in a million, would you put the child in there?
[01:45:50.717 --> 01:45:52.178]  She would say no, wouldn't she?
[01:45:52.178 --> 01:45:53.839]  So there is quite a difference between men and women.
[01:45:53.999 --> 01:45:55.260]  Well look, here's my issue.
[01:45:55.260 --> 01:45:55.621]  I've studied...
[01:46:13.107 --> 01:46:18.812]  As a layperson, I've talked to a lot of experts in nuclear power, and certainly there's some newer technologies.
[01:46:18.812 --> 01:46:20.593]  I want to get your view on this in closing.
[01:46:20.593 --> 01:46:22.214]  And it could be done better.
[01:46:22.214 --> 01:46:32.923]  But the system has shown, and these corporations have shown, I mean, you take the Semi Valley salt reactors, you know, bigger than Chernobyl, blows up for 50 years, they keep it secret.
[01:46:32.923 --> 01:46:38.867]  So they've shown that they don't care, and they don't even want to try to do it safely.
[01:46:38.867 --> 01:46:40.168]  And they're crazy.
[01:46:40.168 --> 01:46:41.930]  And so, I mean, it's kind of like a death penalty.
[01:46:42.430 --> 01:46:52.012]  I am for the death penalty if it was in a village 3,000 years ago and 20 people in the village saw somebody kill a child.
[01:46:52.012 --> 01:46:54.533]  Well, the village takes them, hauls them up and hangs them.
[01:46:54.533 --> 01:46:55.213]  I get that.
[01:46:55.213 --> 01:46:55.913]  I'm for it.
[01:46:55.913 --> 01:47:04.515]  But when you have a government so corrupt it's been caught framing people and a third of those on death row it turns out are innocent.
[01:47:04.515 --> 01:47:10.476]  I have to be against the death penalty because you can't trust the implementation of it by a criminal government.
[01:47:10.476 --> 01:47:10.916]  Same thing.
[01:47:11.476 --> 01:47:12.617]  It comes back to what I was saying.
[01:47:12.617 --> 01:47:14.058]  It's a question of scale, isn't it?
[01:47:14.058 --> 01:47:17.660]  It's a question of the size of the monster that we create.
[01:47:17.660 --> 01:47:24.364]  And it's about time, if we're going to do anything to try and save us all, we're going to have to reduce the size of the units where the decisions are made.
[01:47:24.364 --> 01:47:25.485]  That's my belief.
[01:47:25.485 --> 01:47:26.546]  I think that's our only hope.
[01:47:27.742 --> 01:47:31.945]  Well, yeah, we've got not generals even in the back now.
[01:47:31.945 --> 01:47:42.392]  We've got generals that are sitting in their basement, you know, playing tiddlywinks while the whole world around them is going into... I mean, in closing, look at these articles.
[01:47:42.392 --> 01:47:57.422]  Arrest, pepper spray, gunshots, brawls and doors pulled off hinges, chaos as stores across the US and thousands of shoppers scramble for new Nike Air Jordans because the system says this is success, so people will kill for it.
[01:47:58.302 --> 01:48:02.485]  Well, I think they're going to be dispossessed of that idea in the next year or two.
[01:48:28.407 --> 01:48:29.548]  What, you mean the world depression?
[01:48:29.548 --> 01:48:32.130]  I think it's going to get very serious, Alex.
[01:48:32.130 --> 01:48:33.111]  Yeah, sure.
[01:48:33.111 --> 01:48:34.152]  Oh, it's already serious.
[01:48:34.152 --> 01:48:35.113]  You're right.
[01:48:35.113 --> 01:48:36.754]  And again, we have this delusional thing.
[01:48:36.754 --> 01:48:38.076]  DU is good for you.
[01:48:38.076 --> 01:48:40.077]  Radiation, we're raising the levels.
[01:48:40.077 --> 01:48:41.459]  Saying it's safe.
[01:48:41.459 --> 01:48:43.040]  Oh, it's not a depression.
[01:48:43.040 --> 01:48:44.822]  We're going to give you fake economic numbers.
[01:48:46.553 --> 01:48:47.234]  Well, that's what I said.
[01:48:47.234 --> 01:48:49.756]  That's a sovietization of modern history.
[01:48:49.756 --> 01:48:57.982]  I mean, you know, there was much talk about how the Soviet Union airbrushed people out of history and changed history and made up their bogus statistics and so on.
[01:48:57.982 --> 01:49:01.545]  But I can tell you, there are not bogus statistics going around in the West at the moment.
[01:49:01.545 --> 01:49:05.628]  Well, as you know, as you just pointed out.
[01:49:05.628 --> 01:49:08.590]  Well, hopefully it bottoms out soon and we turn the corner.
[01:49:08.590 --> 01:49:11.913]  But, Doctor, I got a bad feeling it's going to get a lot worse before it turns the corner.
[01:49:11.913 --> 01:49:12.553]  I agree with you.
[01:49:12.553 --> 01:49:13.174]  I agree with you.
[01:49:13.174 --> 01:49:14.635]  It's time to head to the hills, I think.
[01:49:15.811 --> 01:49:17.312]  Oh, that's what I've done.
[01:49:17.312 --> 01:49:18.212]  Yes, sir.
[01:49:18.212 --> 01:49:19.173]  Well, God bless you.
[01:49:19.173 --> 01:49:21.454]  We appreciate you coming on.
[01:49:21.454 --> 01:49:23.736]  And give folks the name of the book one more time.
[01:49:23.736 --> 01:49:28.018]  It's called Fukushima and Health, What to Expect.
[01:49:28.018 --> 01:49:30.319]  And it's published by Green Audit Books.
[01:49:30.319 --> 01:49:36.243]  And it's available from all booksellers or from the Green Audit website, which is www.greenaudit.org.
[01:49:36.243 --> 01:49:39.685]  So just email admin at greenaudit.org.
[01:49:39.685 --> 01:49:40.665]  All right.
[01:49:40.665 --> 01:49:41.466]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:49:41.466 --> 01:49:42.006]  Appreciate it.
[01:49:43.941 --> 01:49:45.502]  Cheers to you, that was a good talk.
[01:49:45.502 --> 01:49:52.507]  And again, ladies and gentlemen, reactors blowing up and them saying it's not a problem and raising the level of radiation that's safe?
[01:49:52.507 --> 01:49:55.269]  Letting troops use DU?
[01:49:55.269 --> 01:49:57.511]  I'm not for any of the nuclear industry, none of it.
[01:49:57.511 --> 01:49:58.411]  I'm done.
[01:49:58.411 --> 01:49:59.012]  I'm done.
[01:49:59.012 --> 01:50:01.194]  Ten years ago, I was pro-nuke.
[01:50:01.194 --> 01:50:02.695]  Now, reality set in.
[01:50:02.695 --> 01:50:04.356]  It's the same thing with GMO.
[01:50:04.356 --> 01:50:07.198]  I've looked at the documents.
[01:50:07.198 --> 01:50:08.019]  I've looked at it.
[01:50:08.019 --> 01:50:08.939]  It's deadly.
[01:50:08.939 --> 01:50:10.581]  It's deadly, deadly, deadly.
[01:50:12.093 --> 01:50:12.533]  And you know what?
[01:50:12.533 --> 01:50:14.135]  They know it's deadly.
[01:50:14.135 --> 01:50:21.100]  The last time Busby was on, I meant to get to this, he said, many of my colleagues believe they're releasing all this radiation on purpose to reduce fertility.
[01:50:21.100 --> 01:50:22.861]  I should have got him to talk about his other colleagues.
[01:50:22.861 --> 01:50:24.983]  He says, I don't know because I can't prove it.
[01:50:24.983 --> 01:50:25.263]  But, but...
[01:50:27.270 --> 01:50:36.772]  If things are out of control, the elite then lie to themselves and create cosmologies that then, oh well, this will just reduce fertility.
[01:50:36.772 --> 01:50:38.153]  Let this happen.
[01:50:38.153 --> 01:50:40.033]  But the truth is, they're just out of control.
[01:50:40.033 --> 01:50:50.236]  Because there's big giant gangs of globalists that team up together, but none of them can step on each other's toes, so the most extreme of the elite then set the precedent
[01:50:50.936 --> 01:50:52.137]  To make things even worse.
[01:50:52.137 --> 01:50:52.878]  You see what I'm saying?
[01:50:52.878 --> 01:50:54.820]  We'll be right back with a ton of news.
[01:50:54.820 --> 01:50:56.062]  We've got a guest coming up.
[01:50:56.062 --> 01:50:57.103]  Lindsey Williams, stay with us.
[01:51:04.246 --> 01:51:09.409]  That's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[01:51:09.409 --> 01:51:11.290]  Don't let your home be the next target.
[01:51:11.290 --> 01:51:14.812]  Make it look like someone is home watching television with Fake TV.
[01:51:14.812 --> 01:51:19.294]  Fake TV is a small electronic device that makes the same light as a real television.
[01:51:19.294 --> 01:51:22.276]  So from outside it looks like someone is home watching TV.
[01:51:22.276 --> 01:51:26.799]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing to burglars.
[01:51:26.799 --> 01:51:32.522]  Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm, and is highly recommended by numerous police departments.
[01:51:32.862 --> 01:51:34.663]  Use it anytime you're away from home.
[01:51:34.663 --> 01:51:39.444]  To order your fake TV for only $34.95, go to faketv.com.
[01:51:39.444 --> 01:51:41.324]  Or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.
[01:51:41.324 --> 01:51:45.185]  Each additional fake TV is only $29.95.
[01:51:45.185 --> 01:51:47.266]  So get one for you and one for a loved one.
[01:51:47.266 --> 01:51:50.267]  For safety, security, and peace of mind for both of you.
[01:51:50.267 --> 01:51:53.888]  Call 877-5-FAKE-TV.
[01:51:53.888 --> 01:51:55.988]  Or go to faketv.com.
[01:51:55.988 --> 01:51:57.689]  Faketv.com.
[01:51:57.689 --> 01:51:58.929]  The burglar deterrent.
[01:52:00.598 --> 01:52:06.444]  There are limitless ways to go into business for yourself, but most involve substantial capital and risk.
[01:52:06.444 --> 01:52:09.647]  Our InfoWarsTeam.com operation is different.

[01:52:48.294 --> 01:52:51.037]  That's the initials MZ and Infowarsteam.com.
[01:52:51.037 --> 01:52:53.660]  That's MZ and Infowarsteam.com.

[01:52:57.444 --> 01:52:59.927]  Whatever you do, visit Infowarsteam.com.
[01:53:01.817 --> 01:53:05.198]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.

[01:53:30.780 --> 01:53:34.762]  In a coming apart world, you need something to keep it tied together.
[01:53:34.762 --> 01:53:36.542]  That something is Atwood Rope.
[01:53:36.542 --> 01:53:38.563]  The highest quality rope made in the USA.
[01:53:38.563 --> 01:53:44.146]  From exotic braids for military, rescue, arborists, shipyards, towline, or boating.

[01:53:56.071 --> 01:53:56.911]  Atwood Rope.
[01:53:56.911 --> 01:53:58.732]  Working to keep the world tied together.
[01:54:05.234 --> 01:54:09.217]  You know, it's really pretty simple.
[01:54:09.217 --> 01:54:15.021]  The social engineers dangle all these fake politicians out.
[01:54:15.021 --> 01:54:24.248]  They have the same model worldwide, that vary only slightly on policies, so that you think you're making a choice, but really they control both outcomes.
[01:54:24.248 --> 01:54:24.929]  And Carol Quigley...
[01:54:26.101 --> 01:54:29.824]  He wrote about that back in the 60s, you know, top professor for the Globalist.
[01:54:29.824 --> 01:54:36.449]  He said that, you know, political parties should appear different on the surface, but really not be, you know, different when it gets down to real policies.
[01:54:36.449 --> 01:54:40.573]  And that's why you look at Newt Gingrich or Mitt Romney, I mean, they are Obama.
[01:54:40.573 --> 01:54:46.037]  It is the same policies, but they call it conservative.
[01:54:46.037 --> 01:54:47.458]  And criticize Obama.
[01:54:47.458 --> 01:54:48.820]  It is totally fake.
[01:54:48.820 --> 01:54:52.763]  And you try to tell Obama supporters, hey, he's going to continue everything Bush did.
[01:54:54.403 --> 01:54:55.885]  And then he comes in and he does it.
[01:54:55.885 --> 01:54:59.991]  And then conservatives get mad at Obama, and I'm like, well, you should love Obama.
[01:54:59.991 --> 01:55:04.879]  He did everything Bush was doing.
[01:55:04.879 --> 01:55:07.462]  And it really is window dressing.
[01:55:07.462 --> 01:55:09.325]  While we're here debating all of this,
[01:55:10.467 --> 01:55:23.094]  Aaron is in there freaking out, digging into documents from the Library of Congress, where they want a license to have children, and how the Western government's funded China to do this, and he's going to have it in a report tonight on the Nightly News.
[01:55:23.094 --> 01:55:24.134]  He's on the Nightly News tonight.
[01:55:24.134 --> 01:55:26.576]  We've got a big report coming out tomorrow on the radio.
[01:55:26.576 --> 01:55:31.018]  It should be done tomorrow, if not, it'll be done Friday.
[01:55:31.018 --> 01:55:34.060]  The government and industry is poisoning you.
[01:55:35.390 --> 01:55:41.473]  They are adding chemicals to the food and water by design, and we have the documents that they're doing it by design.
[01:55:41.473 --> 01:55:43.954]  And the White House science czar is a pioneer of it.
[01:55:43.954 --> 01:55:50.538]  The current White House science czar wrote government policy reports on it.
[01:55:50.538 --> 01:55:51.498]  And they're doing it!
[01:55:51.498 --> 01:55:55.020]  This isn't just theoretical.
[01:55:55.020 --> 01:56:00.083]  And then you see real environmentalism totally co-opted by the globalists and reduced down to
[01:56:01.618 --> 01:56:06.941]  Pay megabanks carbon taxes on carbon dioxide that plants breathe.
[01:56:06.941 --> 01:56:10.244]  Oh, radiation's good for you and DU's good for the troops.
[01:56:10.244 --> 01:56:11.985]  It's that carbon dioxide.
[01:56:11.985 --> 01:56:14.807]  My goodness, we've got to teach kids that's the danger.
[01:56:14.807 --> 01:56:18.849]  You see, they take our real concerns and create counterfeits.
[01:56:18.849 --> 01:56:24.353]  They take our real energies to make a good world and then they shunt it off into what they're doing.
[01:56:24.353 --> 01:56:26.234]  And it's so frustrating.
[01:56:31.670 --> 01:56:34.857]  That was a very informative talk with Dr. Busbee.
[01:56:34.857 --> 01:56:37.943]  At 8 after next hour we've got Lindsey Williams joining us.
[01:56:37.943 --> 01:56:40.088]  Ron Paul is maintaining his lead in Iowa.
[01:56:41.363 --> 01:56:44.885]  Public policy polling has come out with a bunch of other polls showing it.
[01:56:44.885 --> 01:56:51.930]  Some of them showing widening his lead, but there's a new spin going that, oh my gosh, Romney's gaining on him.
[01:56:51.930 --> 01:57:00.336]  Paul could be faltering, not true, but it could become a self-fulfilling prophecy where people go, well, if he's losing, I better not be on his bandwagon.
[01:57:00.336 --> 01:57:02.117]  I want to pick whoever the winning team is.
[01:57:03.663 --> 01:57:07.145]  That's like folks that only root for a football team once they're in the playoffs.
[01:57:07.145 --> 01:57:08.746]  It's just pointless.
[01:57:08.746 --> 01:57:10.367]  The whole thing's pointless.
[01:57:10.367 --> 01:57:15.970]  Paul holds slim lead over Romney in first post-Christmas Iowa poll.
[01:57:15.970 --> 01:57:19.352]  Gingrich unloads on Paul, says he's worse than Obama.
[01:57:19.352 --> 01:57:23.074]  No, you are Obama with white skin.
[01:57:23.074 --> 01:57:25.536]  And you've got all of this, and then meanwhile,
[01:57:28.052 --> 01:57:35.295]  We sit here and make fun of North Koreans worshipping their evil dictators who have murdered millions of them.
[01:57:35.295 --> 01:57:38.277]  They know most North Koreans.
[01:57:38.277 --> 01:57:42.719]  They've sent undercover anthropologists and sociologists in.
[01:57:42.719 --> 01:57:46.200]  Those people know they're evil and know they're horrible.
[01:57:46.200 --> 01:57:50.182]  Even the state party apparatus, Apparatchik knows that.
[01:57:50.182 --> 01:57:51.523]  But they play along with it.
[01:57:53.109 --> 01:57:54.610]  And that's the danger here.
[01:57:54.610 --> 01:57:56.871]  We can go two ways as things implode.
[01:57:56.871 --> 01:58:02.793]  People can really wake up, decide we can stand up and take our country back and our world back, or we go the other way.
[01:58:02.793 --> 01:58:20.001]  If people don't hit the barbed wire first, as an example to others, we're going to see the public get more into government worship, more delusional, and do whatever the system says and by any amount of lies.
[01:58:22.386 --> 01:58:35.610]  And a lot of that's going to happen because under this new planned economy, the only jobs there's going to be is in homeland security, in tattling, in spying, in grabbing people's genitals, in control-freaking, in data-mining.
[01:58:35.610 --> 01:58:41.451]  The military-industrial complex is eating America.

[01:59:03.105 --> 01:59:11.831]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.

[01:59:20.322 --> 01:59:24.906]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.

[01:59:28.769 --> 01:59:29.990]  Others don't.
[01:59:29.990 --> 01:59:32.132]  We turn jeans inside out.

[01:59:48.505 --> 01:59:49.005]  Others don't.
[01:59:53.792 --> 01:59:56.175]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.175 --> 01:59:58.959]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.560 --> 02:00:10.401]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.401 --> 02:00:11.982]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.982 --> 02:00:13.522]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.522 --> 02:00:17.723]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.723 --> 02:00:21.784]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:33.773 --> 02:00:38.696]  Okay, I'm going to try in this segment than next to shut up and give Lindsey Williams the floor.
[02:00:38.696 --> 02:00:52.405]  He doesn't need much introduction here for our audience on AM and FM and XM, but he was a pastor, worked with some of the largest oil companies for three years, and was brought into their board of directors meetings as a liaison to the Roughnecks.
[02:00:52.405 --> 02:00:58.909]  And he wrote the bestseller Energy Non-Crisis, which has now been borne out that they have more oil than Saudi Arabia and Alaska discovered.
[02:01:00.543 --> 02:01:08.988]  Now, one of his sources died last Christmas, you know, a year plus ago, not this Christmas last week, but a year before that.
[02:01:08.988 --> 02:01:12.150]  And so he was able to go public with his name, Mr. Fromm.
[02:01:12.150 --> 02:01:18.434]  I know who the other source is, a former CEO of a major oil company, and he told him a year and a half ago, he said, watch the Middle East blow up.
[02:01:19.400 --> 02:01:22.481]  I want him to recap the history of this in this short segment and then come back.
[02:01:22.481 --> 02:01:25.783]  He's got some more breaking news from his source.
[02:01:25.783 --> 02:01:28.284]  He said they're trying to prod Iran into war.
[02:01:28.284 --> 02:01:30.365]  That's where all this is going.
[02:01:30.365 --> 02:01:33.126]  Pastor Williams, thanks for joining us.
[02:01:33.126 --> 02:01:44.831]  Alex, thank you for allowing me the privilege of joining you today because I was given something a few days ago by my elitist friend and he said, I want you to go to a certain place.
[02:01:45.780 --> 02:01:49.972]  And he said, whenever you go there, you will know what's going to happen next.
[02:01:50.692 --> 02:01:54.695]  Now, when we come into this next segment, I'm going to give you this.
[02:01:54.695 --> 02:02:07.166]  And the reason I'm capping it ahead of time is to beg and plead with every person out in the audience of GPN and InfoWars to go and get a piece of paper and a pencil.
[02:02:07.166 --> 02:02:17.054]  You must write down what this man gave me when he said, you go to this certain place and you will know what's going to happen next.
[02:02:17.054 --> 02:02:19.356]  And this is going to impact the life
[02:02:20.154 --> 02:02:26.339]  Of you, Alex Jones, it's going to impact GPN as nothing ever has before.
[02:02:26.339 --> 02:02:32.264]  It's going to impact my life and the life of every American out there as nothing ever has in your lifetime.
[02:02:32.264 --> 02:02:42.352]  And I feel so honored that God, years ago, would have allowed me, by His providence, to live with the elite, to know some of these people over these years.
[02:02:42.352 --> 02:02:46.716]  And now, I honestly believe, Alex, that they are clearing their conscience.
[02:02:47.436 --> 02:02:49.698]  Is the reason they're giving me some of these things.
[02:02:49.698 --> 02:02:54.041]  So folks, I'll recap the Middle East first right now.
[02:02:54.041 --> 02:03:02.848]  And then in the next segment, you're going to hear probably the greatest information that you'll hear in days and weeks.
[02:03:02.848 --> 02:03:08.412]  Okay, first of all, everything is happening in the Middle East exactly like they said it was going to happen.
[02:03:09.275 --> 02:03:12.536]  Let me state again what I was told.
[02:03:12.536 --> 02:03:16.777]  The financial collapse is not going to take place right now.
[02:03:16.777 --> 02:03:18.278]  It will happen.
[02:03:18.278 --> 02:03:19.718]  And they have it planned.
[02:03:19.718 --> 02:03:21.359]  They know when it's going to happen.
[02:03:21.359 --> 02:03:22.979]  I do not have a date.
[02:03:22.979 --> 02:03:24.700]  Secondly, let me go to Iran.
[02:03:26.148 --> 02:03:33.712]  I know many of you thought back a week or two or three ago prior to Christmas that we were just ready to have a war with Iran.
[02:03:33.712 --> 02:03:43.576]  And at the time I came on InfoWars with Alex Jones and I said there is not going to be a war with Iran this month or next.
[02:03:43.576 --> 02:03:47.558]  And it won't happen for a period of time, but it is already planned.
[02:03:48.038 --> 02:03:56.745]  You'll remember that Mr. Fahm said to me back about two and a half, three years ago, he laughed on the phone and said, Chaplain's not going to happen for at least two and a half years.
[02:03:56.745 --> 02:03:58.746]  Well, all that's changed now.
[02:03:58.746 --> 02:04:11.316]  It is time for them to have a conflict with Iran, and I warned you that it will take place in future months, but that you have a window of opportunity right now to do something about preparing yourself
[02:04:11.857 --> 02:04:12.178]  I'm good.
[02:04:19.531 --> 02:04:21.112]  That fits into all of this.
[02:04:49.892 --> 02:04:50.913]  I'll tell you what, stay there.
[02:04:50.913 --> 02:04:51.694]  It's a sick joke.
[02:04:51.694 --> 02:04:58.564]  We're going to come back with a $600 billion transfer of your tax money to the globalists on the other side with Lindsey Williams.
[02:05:05.057 --> 02:05:06.318]  Tyranny is here.
[02:05:06.318 --> 02:05:10.161]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:05:10.161 --> 02:05:12.642]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:05:12.642 --> 02:05:18.346]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:05:18.346 --> 02:05:25.011]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:05:25.011 --> 02:05:30.995]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:05:30.995 --> 02:05:34.658]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:05:35.138 --> 02:05:39.441]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:05:39.441 --> 02:05:45.405]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:05:45.405 --> 02:05:48.947]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:05:48.947 --> 02:05:50.928]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:05:50.928 --> 02:05:52.049]  It's here.

[02:06:03.510 --> 02:06:08.813]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:06:08.813 --> 02:06:10.354]  Saving means to make money.
[02:06:10.354 --> 02:06:19.139]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.

[02:06:27.404 --> 02:06:35.409]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:06:35.409 --> 02:06:40.632]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[02:08:01.102 --> 02:08:06.367]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:06.367 --> 02:08:08.630]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:15.683 --> 02:08:19.386]  Okay, we are now into the third hour of worldwide broadcast.
[02:08:19.386 --> 02:08:22.469]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:08:22.469 --> 02:08:33.117]  At the bottom of the hour, in the last 30 minutes of this interview, we're going to have your questions or comments for Lindsey Williams, the best-selling author of the Energy Non-Crisis, which has, again, been proven accurate.
[02:08:33.117 --> 02:08:38.802]  He wrote it, what, 30 years ago, exposing what he discovered working for the big oil companies in Alaska.
[02:08:38.802 --> 02:08:42.225]  There was more proven reserves there than all of Saudi Arabia.
[02:08:43.353 --> 02:08:47.736]  And of course, what is allowed out of there when 80% of it goes to China and Japan?
[02:08:47.736 --> 02:08:50.798]  It's a managed global economy.
[02:08:50.798 --> 02:09:00.224]  And that's why they use the fake environmentalists and others to keep us off of our own oil supply, our own natural gas, you name it.
[02:09:00.224 --> 02:09:03.466]  Because they've got deals geopolitically.
[02:09:03.466 --> 02:09:05.248]  The truth is the world is awash in oil.
[02:09:06.235 --> 02:09:15.822]  And the system is trying to keep it artificially scarce and then make us go into things like nuclear and other systems that are specialized so only certain insiders are able to operate.
[02:09:15.822 --> 02:09:20.925]  Now, that's why they're shutting down our coal system that supplies 51% of our power right now.
[02:09:20.925 --> 02:09:26.349]  It's a dastardly program of artificial scarcity, but that's how Lindsey Williams has been known to the world.
[02:09:27.492 --> 02:09:28.813]  The last 30 years.
[02:09:28.813 --> 02:09:31.736]  Now, he has two sources known to myself and Dr. Stan Monteith.
[02:09:31.736 --> 02:09:34.138]  One of them died, of course, a year ago.
[02:09:34.138 --> 02:09:36.119]  Not this Christmas, but last Christmas.
[02:09:36.119 --> 02:09:40.363]  Mr. Fromm, the other source is known to us, and is a top, you know, globalist.
[02:09:40.363 --> 02:09:44.447]  He's retired, but he told us what was coming up a year and a half ago in the Middle East.
[02:09:44.447 --> 02:09:49.090]  He's told us when gas would go to 150 and then that it would go to 40, and it did.
[02:09:49.090 --> 02:09:51.092]  Everybody laughed at that, and it happened.
[02:09:51.092 --> 02:09:51.292]  Now,
[02:09:54.116 --> 02:09:56.337]  In the past, I have given information that the elite gave me.
[02:09:56.337 --> 02:10:00.858]  I would come on the Alex Jones Show and I would say, I just had a phone call from Mr. Fromm and he said,
[02:10:17.341 --> 02:10:26.428]  The appeal price is going to go $147 a barrel, $50 a barrel, and about three years ago I came on your show and I said that.
[02:10:26.428 --> 02:10:30.030]  People laughed at me and it happened exactly like he said it.
[02:10:30.030 --> 02:10:46.282]  Now, usually, always in the past, in fact, I can't remember any time in the past 35 years, I would come on your show, Alex, and I would say, uh, I have just been told this by the elite, and you'll have to believe it based on the fact that they told it to me.
[02:10:47.020 --> 02:10:54.223]  Now the track record proves itself that every single time what they've told me has happened exactly like they have said it.
[02:10:54.223 --> 02:11:12.690]  What I'm going to give today that has never been heard on international media, you positively have not heard it on Alex Jones Show before, at least to my knowledge you haven't, and to my knowledge there's probably no more than a handful of people on the face of the earth that know what you're going to hear right now.
[02:11:13.470 --> 02:11:18.315]  This time, you don't have to take my word for it that the elite gave it to me.
[02:11:18.315 --> 02:11:28.124]  I'm going to give you what they gave me, and when you see this, you are going to realize that it's going to impact your life, Alex.
[02:11:28.124 --> 02:11:31.947]  It's going to impact Genesis Network.
[02:11:31.947 --> 02:11:34.570]  It's going to impact Lindsey Williams and my dinner table.
[02:11:35.390 --> 02:11:44.937]  And it's going to impact every single person, especially in the United States of America, more than anything has in my entire life, and I'm 75 years of age.
[02:11:44.937 --> 02:11:47.519]  I give this with fear and trembling.
[02:11:47.519 --> 02:11:50.761]  Now, you have had time to get you a pencil and paper.
[02:11:50.761 --> 02:11:52.542]  If you didn't get them, it's your own fault.
[02:11:52.542 --> 02:11:54.263]  You're gonna have to remember it.
[02:11:54.263 --> 02:12:03.330]  But please, write this down, and then as I go through this, you are going to go and prove this, what the elite told me.
[02:12:03.330 --> 02:12:04.931]  I want you to write down a date.
[02:12:05.703 --> 02:12:07.849]  The date is November the 21st, 2002.
[02:12:07.849 --> 02:12:09.274]  You have it?
[02:12:12.762 --> 02:12:16.305]  November the 21st, 2002.
[02:12:16.305 --> 02:12:18.466]  Don't you dare change that dial.
[02:12:18.466 --> 02:12:22.269]  You stay right here on the Alex Jones Show through the entire time.
[02:12:22.269 --> 02:12:25.412]  You are going to be appalled at what you're going to hear.
[02:12:25.412 --> 02:12:32.717]  You can go after the show and prove this for yourself by going on the internet and looking up what they told me.
[02:12:32.717 --> 02:12:33.638]  Did you hear that?
[02:12:33.638 --> 02:12:36.520]  I said they told me to go to this point
[02:12:37.100 --> 02:12:43.845]  And looked it up, and I would know what was going to happen next, and I'm going to give it to you right now.
[02:12:43.845 --> 02:12:55.672]  On November the 21st of 2002, Mr. Ben Bernanke, who is today the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, made a speech.
[02:12:55.672 --> 02:12:58.974]  I don't think anybody knew the importance of that speech.
[02:12:58.974 --> 02:12:59.855]  I never knew it.
[02:12:59.855 --> 02:13:02.877]  In fact, I didn't know it existed until about two weeks ago.
[02:13:03.835 --> 02:13:08.999]  And when I looked it up, I trembled, honestly.
[02:13:08.999 --> 02:13:17.264]  And he gave something in that speech that now you are having brought to you because they're clearing their conscience.
[02:13:17.264 --> 02:13:28.812]  I don't know any way to say it except men who are in their 70s and 80s were a part of the elite back when I knew them years ago and literally rubbed shoulders with them, lived with them for three years.
[02:13:28.812 --> 02:13:31.634]  Today, these men know they're facing eternity.
[02:13:32.235 --> 02:13:34.439]  And these old men are talking.
[02:13:34.439 --> 02:13:40.511]  And when you look up that date of November the 21st, 2002, and go to National Economist Club,
[02:13:43.783 --> 02:14:02.708]  In Washington, D.C., and Ben Bernanke, who was not Federal Reserve Chairman at that time, he still was just a governor, and at the time, he made a speech to the National Economist Club in Washington, D.C., on November the 21st of 2002.
[02:14:02.708 --> 02:14:11.131]  Now, the reason I'm giving you that is because now I'm going to give you a brief background so that you will understand
[02:14:12.183 --> 02:14:16.284]  How I got this and why these people gave it to me.
[02:14:16.284 --> 02:14:22.766]  Many of you have heard me say before the Alex Jones Show and by the way I'm trying to talk slow enough today so you can pick this up.
[02:14:22.766 --> 02:14:39.510]  Normally I go a mile a minute because I have so much to say and I do have that much to say today and you're going to be appalled but right now you must get the details on this because there has nothing ever affected your life like this is going to affect you in your lifetime.
[02:14:39.510 --> 02:14:41.191]  So a little background briefly.
[02:14:41.954 --> 02:14:50.983]  Many of you have heard me say on the Alex Jones Show that when I lived with the elite for those three years many years ago and got to know some of them personally,
[02:14:52.065 --> 02:14:54.806]  They have a code of ethics.
[02:14:54.806 --> 02:15:03.508]  One of the first things I learned is not the code of ethics that Alex has, not the same code of ethics that Lindsay Williams has, and many of you out there in the listening audience.
[02:15:03.508 --> 02:15:09.350]  Their code of ethics is not a code of ethics of the Scriptures and the Bible, as all founding fathers had.
[02:15:09.350 --> 02:15:19.893]  Their code of ethics is different, but one facet of their code of ethics is they must tell you, before they do it, everything that they're going to do.
[02:15:20.811 --> 02:15:37.089]  Now, Mr. Ken Flom said to me back about three, oh I guess about two years ago before he died, he said to me one day, he said, Chaplain, when the Federal Reserve begins to buy their own securities, it's all over for the dollar.
[02:15:37.711 --> 02:15:42.333]  And at the time, I did not have the slightest idea what the man was talking about.
[02:15:42.333 --> 02:15:49.995]  Because the Federal Reserve had not begun to buy its T-bills and securities that weren't bought by the foreign nation.
[02:15:49.995 --> 02:15:51.756]  That's monetization of debt.
[02:15:51.756 --> 02:15:53.497]  Now they're monetizing close to 80% of it.
[02:15:54.878 --> 02:15:55.659]  Yes.
[02:15:55.659 --> 02:16:06.372]  Now, in one year's time, they began this approximately one year ago, and Alex, you're right, that's a monetarization of the debt, and all they do is take it out of one pocket, put it in the other.
[02:16:06.372 --> 02:16:13.861]  One year ago, they began doing this, and as of right now, the Federal Reserve owns, owns
[02:16:15.055 --> 02:16:20.200]  Uh, three trillion dollars of the national debt.
[02:16:20.200 --> 02:16:21.821]  It is phony.
[02:16:21.821 --> 02:16:23.182]  It's a paper entry.
[02:16:23.182 --> 02:16:25.384]  It's a computer type.
[02:16:25.384 --> 02:16:27.546]  It is utterly unbelievable.
[02:16:27.546 --> 02:16:29.728]  And the Communist Chinese are the other big owners.
[02:16:30.832 --> 02:16:39.178]  They own, as of right now, today, as far as we can tell, the Federal Reserve owns as much of the national debt as China does.
[02:16:39.178 --> 02:16:42.340]  China has bought our key bills, has bought our securities.
[02:16:42.340 --> 02:16:44.821]  And it's their debt, but they're maneuvering us into it.
[02:16:44.821 --> 02:16:50.005]  So what was so important in this speech that your source directed you to?
[02:16:50.005 --> 02:16:58.110]  Well, what he said to me was, he said, go to this particular place and you will know exactly what they're going to do next.
[02:16:59.065 --> 02:17:02.347]  And this is what I want to give you right now.
[02:17:02.347 --> 02:17:11.333]  On that date, November the 21st, 2002, Ben Bernanke, who later became the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
[02:17:11.333 --> 02:17:22.440]  Now, what I was told was that the reason he became the chairman, this is so important folks, he became the chairman of the Federal Reserve because of this speech.
[02:17:22.440 --> 02:17:27.043]  He said everything in this speech that the elite wanted to hear,
[02:17:27.823 --> 02:17:31.186]  And because he was the most likely to carry it out.
[02:17:31.186 --> 02:17:33.669]  Because it seemed that he believed it.
[02:17:33.669 --> 02:17:42.497]  And when he gave this speech, it basically put him in as the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, which he presently is.
[02:17:42.497 --> 02:17:46.901]  And in the speech, he told everything that he would do.
[02:17:46.901 --> 02:17:48.543]  Folks, please.
[02:17:49.624 --> 02:17:52.466]  Everything he would do, I'm going to outline them for you.
[02:17:52.466 --> 02:17:54.166]  There are five points.
[02:17:54.166 --> 02:17:56.127]  Now, let me warn you ahead of time.
[02:17:56.127 --> 02:17:59.109]  When you go to the speech, it's very difficult to read.
[02:17:59.109 --> 02:18:01.130]  It's all banker's jargon.
[02:18:01.130 --> 02:18:09.174]  What I have done is taken it and put it in simple terms that Lindsey Williams can understand and that I think you'll pick up on.
[02:18:09.794 --> 02:18:12.957]  And in the speech, he said that he would do five things.
[02:18:12.957 --> 02:18:16.501]  Let me tell you why, when he said he would do it.
[02:18:16.501 --> 02:18:21.145]  Again, let me go back and say, he at least said to me, go to this place.
[02:18:21.145 --> 02:18:24.808]  I understand they're saying this is a key speech, so break it down.
[02:18:24.808 --> 02:18:29.533]  Yes, number one, he said if I am ever faced with another
[02:18:30.256 --> 02:18:31.597]  I will not restrict money supply.
[02:18:31.597 --> 02:18:32.577]  I will monetize it.
[02:18:44.605 --> 02:18:50.247]  Yeah, he said, number one, he said, I will lower the interest rates to zero.
[02:18:50.247 --> 02:18:52.388]  Now, please, read the speech, folks, every one of you.
[02:18:52.388 --> 02:18:54.828]  You've got to go to that point and read it for yourself.
[02:18:54.828 --> 02:18:55.929]  It's pages long.
[02:18:55.929 --> 02:18:57.649]  I'm giving you a synopsis.
[02:18:57.649 --> 02:19:01.051]  No, I'm actually familiar with the speech, but I'm glad you mentioned this.
[02:19:01.051 --> 02:19:10.954]  So I figured this was an important speech, and I've seen The Globalist quote it before, so that's obviously what your contact is doing, because this is the blueprint for what we're going under.
[02:19:11.755 --> 02:19:18.240]  Yes, and my contact knew exactly what was going to happen next, and I don't have a date for it.
[02:19:18.240 --> 02:19:20.842]  I wish I did, but I'm going to give it to you.
[02:19:20.842 --> 02:19:25.145]  Number one, he said I would lower interest rates to zero.
[02:19:25.145 --> 02:19:28.288]  Well, you say it's a little above zero, .3, .4.
[02:19:28.288 --> 02:19:29.949]  Well, so what?
[02:19:29.949 --> 02:19:38.596]  For all practical purposes, when Ben Bernanke became the chairman of the Federal Reserve, he did exactly what he said in that speech in November the 21st, 2002.
[02:19:40.077 --> 02:19:45.178]  And the reason that's such a big deal is obviously it means they're going to basically devalue the currency down to nothing.
[02:19:45.178 --> 02:19:52.981]  The decision has been made to kill the dollar as we know it, which will be a giant transfer of wealth from the people to the elite.
[02:19:52.981 --> 02:19:53.781]  Lindsey, stay with us.
[02:19:53.781 --> 02:19:59.582]  Let's come down and get to the rest of this key Bernanke speech straight ahead, and then phone calls for our guest at 800-259-9301.
[02:20:03.737 --> 02:20:08.219]  Folks, have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on?
[02:20:08.219 --> 02:20:11.560]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[02:20:11.560 --> 02:20:15.941]  Because there's never been a better time to get ready for the winter power outages ahead.
[02:20:15.941 --> 02:20:16.962]  Here's why.
[02:20:16.962 --> 02:20:22.724]  Solar power generators are now available from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[02:20:23.084 --> 02:20:27.947]  Their emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[02:20:27.947 --> 02:20:34.330]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity from the sun.
[02:20:34.330 --> 02:20:38.172]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:20:38.172 --> 02:20:44.116]  Whether it's ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:20:44.116 --> 02:20:49.739]  When the power goes out this winter, you'll be ready with a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[02:20:49.739 --> 02:20:49.999]  Go to

[02:21:05.988 --> 02:21:09.890]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.

[02:24:06.996 --> 02:24:11.400]  TSA Spot Searches expands to Union Station.
[02:24:12.475 --> 02:24:20.817]  And I've seen newscasts out of Florida where you get off a train or a bus and they walk over and start sticking their hands down your wife and children's pants.
[02:24:20.817 --> 02:24:22.437]  We've played those newscasts here.
[02:24:22.437 --> 02:24:25.558]  And the reporters sit there with a straight face about how great this is.
[02:24:25.558 --> 02:24:29.099]  Again, they're not claiming somebody's trying to blow up trains.
[02:24:29.099 --> 02:24:31.839]  It's when you're getting off of them.
[02:24:31.839 --> 02:24:35.100]  It's just pure harassment.
[02:24:35.100 --> 02:24:37.281]  They're looking for drugs, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:24:37.281 --> 02:24:38.781]  It's all just training us
[02:24:40.407 --> 02:24:45.610]  We've got my full-spectrum analysis on full-spectrum eugenics at Infowars.com.
[02:24:45.610 --> 02:24:50.653]  Iran promises to close down oil route if sanctions imposed.
[02:24:50.653 --> 02:24:56.397]  I remember back in early December Lindsey saying it's not going to be this December but it's coming up in three or four months.
[02:24:57.449 --> 02:25:01.333]  And who knows, they may be able to back it off and not start it, but it's just crazy.
[02:25:01.333 --> 02:25:07.960]  Lindsey, this is a short segment, and you're gracious to come back, and you've got some breaking news today, but I also want to go to some calls.
[02:25:07.960 --> 02:25:17.229]  But they're pointing out this Bernanke speech, and I'm glad that your elitist friend, former oil company CEO, is pointing at this speech.
[02:25:19.468 --> 02:25:23.712]  During the break, I didn't try to go pull it up, but I think this is a speech he gave quite a bit.
[02:25:23.712 --> 02:25:30.378]  It's why he's known as Helicopter Ben back in the early 2000s when he was lobbying to be chairman.
[02:25:30.378 --> 02:25:34.882]  As you point out, he was only a governor on one of the Fed offices.
[02:25:34.882 --> 02:25:38.825]  A real governor of America, that's how they run it.
[02:25:38.825 --> 02:25:42.649]  But this is important because it's the signal to debase the currency.
[02:25:42.649 --> 02:25:44.631]  Is that what your friend was pointing out?
[02:25:46.138 --> 02:25:55.182]  Well, Alex, when we come to the fifth point, that's exactly what I'll say, but since this is a short segment, please, let me give one thing here that I think is so important.
[02:25:55.182 --> 02:25:58.684]  It's very unusual that I'm on your show today.
[02:25:58.684 --> 02:26:04.027]  Now, please, bear with me, folks, because this is Providence, any way you put it.
[02:26:04.027 --> 02:26:11.130]  I have had, Alex, I have had no telling how many talk show hosts have called me recently and said, you haven't been on a while.
[02:26:11.130 --> 02:26:13.811]  Would you please come on between Christmas and New Year's?
[02:26:13.811 --> 02:26:15.092]  I turned every one of them down.
[02:26:15.871 --> 02:26:18.534]  I did not want to give this until after the first of the year.
[02:26:18.534 --> 02:26:18.955]  Oh wow.
[02:26:18.955 --> 02:26:21.017]  Because I had to do more research on it.
[02:26:21.017 --> 02:26:25.983]  Your producer called on yesterday to my office and I was not here.
[02:26:27.069 --> 02:26:33.351]  And the person who answered the telephone, my wife, said, oh sure, Lindsey, we'll be glad to be on your show tomorrow.
[02:26:33.351 --> 02:26:36.152]  That's the only reason I'm here today.
[02:26:36.152 --> 02:26:36.752]  Amazing!
[02:26:36.752 --> 02:26:38.053]  That is providence.
[02:26:38.053 --> 02:26:38.853]  That is providence.
[02:26:38.853 --> 02:26:47.956]  So, wow, so break down, because we see one of these speeches, we get some info from it, but a globalist knows how to decipher in all that weird banker language.
[02:26:49.218 --> 02:27:07.514]  He does, and whenever you go to Ben Bernanke, we'll give it one more time, Ben Bernanke's speech on November the 21st, 2002, before the National Economist Club of Washington, D.C., read the entire speech, pages long, and he said, if I am ever faced with another Great Depression,
[02:27:08.993 --> 02:27:12.536]  He said, number one, I will bring interest rates to zero.
[02:27:12.536 --> 02:27:22.864]  Well, when he became Federal Reserve Chairman, and most people think because of that speech he gave back in 2002, they liked what he said so well, that's the first thing he did.
[02:27:22.864 --> 02:27:26.587]  Now, folks, please, you've got to remember what he did back then.
[02:27:26.587 --> 02:27:37.816]  When he first became Federal Reserve Chairman, he took interest rates to, and it's somewhere upon .2, .3 today for all practical purposes, he took it to zero, exactly what he said he would do.
[02:27:39.037 --> 02:27:46.823]  He said, I will buy securities from the banks to expand the federal balance sheets.
[02:27:46.823 --> 02:27:49.826]  Now folks, you're going to have to go back and do some homework on this.
[02:27:49.826 --> 02:27:53.729]  You're going to have to do some research on your own when you read that man's speech.
[02:27:53.729 --> 02:27:55.630]  I read it once, I read it twice.
[02:27:55.630 --> 02:27:57.552]  Yeah, that's massive corporate welfare.
[02:27:57.552 --> 02:28:04.117]  That is getting the people in debt directly to the banksters in a form of economic espionage.
[02:28:04.741 --> 02:28:07.483]  He said, I will buy the securities.
[02:28:07.483 --> 02:28:09.985]  Do you realize what they did when they bought General Motors?
[02:28:09.985 --> 02:28:13.027]  What they did whenever they bought Chrysler?
[02:28:13.027 --> 02:28:17.270]  Do you realize what they're doing whenever they bail out all of the banks?
[02:28:17.270 --> 02:28:24.096]  They're nationalizing everything, but keeping the power in the private corporations, just like with the EU takeover.
[02:28:24.096 --> 02:28:27.038]  They're making the banksters the government.
[02:28:27.038 --> 02:28:29.820]  Yes, and they bought, he bought the securities.
[02:28:30.572 --> 02:28:36.718]  From the banks to expand the Fed's ballot sheet to make it look good.
[02:28:36.718 --> 02:28:44.966]  Number three, and the closer I get to number five, the more afraid I get even giving this, but you've got to understand where it came from.
[02:28:44.966 --> 02:28:48.589]  He said, go and look this up, Kapil, and you'll know what's going to happen next.
[02:28:48.589 --> 02:28:51.512]  Now, he has already lowered the interest rates to zero.
[02:28:51.512 --> 02:28:52.393]  He has already
[02:28:52.853 --> 02:28:53.373]  I think so.
[02:29:14.671 --> 02:29:18.634]  They're doing, they're getting everything ready for number five, and I'll show it to you.
[02:29:18.634 --> 02:29:38.187]  Over Christmas Day, while you were having a good time partying, and I'm so glad George Washington realized years ago on Christmas Eve that the Hessians would be drunk, and would be rallying for the good time, and he threw England out, basically, on that night.
[02:29:38.447 --> 02:29:40.029]  Well, that's when they turn the tide.
[02:29:40.029 --> 02:29:40.589]  Stay there.
[02:29:40.589 --> 02:29:42.071]  Amazing.
[02:29:42.071 --> 02:29:42.791]  Lindsey, stay there.
[02:29:42.791 --> 02:29:46.996]  Let's come back and continue with this key information straight ahead.
[02:29:46.996 --> 02:29:48.797]  And phone calls for people that are waiting.
[02:29:48.797 --> 02:29:50.379]  We'll get to four and five straight ahead.
[02:29:50.379 --> 02:29:51.780]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.780 --> 02:29:54.303]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.303 --> 02:29:56.966]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.001 --> 02:30:05.544]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:30:05.544 --> 02:30:06.465]  Number 1.
[02:30:06.465 --> 02:30:09.887]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:09.887 --> 02:30:10.748]  Number 2.
[02:30:10.748 --> 02:30:15.631]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:30:15.631 --> 02:30:16.391]  It's true.
[02:30:16.391 --> 02:30:21.255]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:30:21.255 --> 02:30:22.075]  Number 3.
[02:30:22.075 --> 02:30:25.657]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:30:25.657 --> 02:30:29.360]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:29.560 --> 02:30:30.361]  Number 4.
[02:30:30.361 --> 02:30:33.124]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:30:33.124 --> 02:30:36.808]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:30:36.808 --> 02:30:37.588]  Number 5.
[02:30:37.588 --> 02:30:41.733]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:30:41.733 --> 02:30:46.498]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:30:46.778 --> 02:30:50.962]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:50.962 --> 02:30:52.744]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:52.744 --> 02:30:55.006]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:30:55.006 --> 02:30:57.349]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:31:02.674 --> 02:31:06.635]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:06.635 --> 02:31:15.498]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:31:15.498 --> 02:31:20.119]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:31:20.119 --> 02:31:30.942]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:31:31.582 --> 02:31:41.091]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:41.091 --> 02:31:46.536]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:31:46.536 --> 02:31:54.022]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:54.022 --> 02:31:56.785]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[02:32:01.883 --> 02:32:05.524]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:32:05.524 --> 02:32:09.145]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:32:09.145 --> 02:32:13.926]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:32:13.926 --> 02:32:20.328]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:32:20.328 --> 02:32:22.569]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:32:23.109 --> 02:32:24.530]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:32:24.530 --> 02:32:25.690]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:32:25.690 --> 02:32:28.111]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:32:42.017 --> 02:32:44.138]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:32:44.138 --> 02:32:49.302]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:32:49.302 --> 02:33:04.371]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:33:04.371 --> 02:33:09.274]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:33:09.274 --> 02:33:10.455]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:12.950 --> 02:33:16.992]  Our info is hardcore, it's no joke.
[02:33:16.992 --> 02:33:23.934]  You know, I've started digging into bioweapons and things and confirmed the government programs for weaponized cancer.
[02:33:23.934 --> 02:33:25.015]  That's what AIDS came out of.
[02:33:27.054 --> 02:33:27.534]  I think?
[02:33:47.483 --> 02:33:58.395]  A stunning coldness that I feel and I just pray people get their hearts right with God because the world is going into a very insane time.
[02:33:58.395 --> 02:34:01.659]  As crazy as things are now, we ain't seen nothing yet as they say.
[02:34:01.659 --> 02:34:07.065]  We're going back to Lindsey here in a moment and I promise your calls.
[02:34:07.065 --> 02:34:07.966]  If you want to support us,
[02:34:10.273 --> 02:34:16.314]  Go to the InfoWars.com store, buy books, buy DVDs, buy t-shirts, InfoWars flags.
[02:34:16.314 --> 02:34:22.436]  All of it helps get the word out, informs you to a higher level, is a testament to what's really going on.
[02:34:22.436 --> 02:34:33.838]  Here is Politico, bloggers, SOPA's the end of us, and even mainstream media admits this is the total takeover and end of free speech, preemptively, and the Pentagon runs it.
[02:34:35.680 --> 02:34:43.144]  The 80 inventors of the internet have come out, as you know, and said that it is the end of freedom and that America has now been taken over by pure evil.
[02:34:43.144 --> 02:34:43.765]  That's A.P.
[02:34:43.765 --> 02:34:44.085]  Reuters.
[02:34:46.135 --> 02:34:51.997]  The Department of Homeland Security is using fake Facebook and Twitter accounts to monitor posts containing certain keywords.
[02:34:51.997 --> 02:34:54.098]  Yeah, and to spam disinfo.
[02:34:54.098 --> 02:34:57.420]  And again, the Department of Defense doesn't work for America.
[02:34:57.420 --> 02:35:00.281]  It works for the New World Order global banks.
[02:35:00.281 --> 02:35:04.062]  The average people, individually, are good in the military.
[02:35:04.062 --> 02:35:05.983]  On average, they're some of the best people out there.
[02:35:05.983 --> 02:35:07.644]  They join for the right reasons, many of them.
[02:35:08.877 --> 02:35:16.322]  I found the military are about the best group out there, quite frankly, for waking up, being serious, supporting Ron Paul, supporting Liberty.
[02:35:16.322 --> 02:35:19.084]  But the one reason they're awake is they're in the middle of it.
[02:35:19.084 --> 02:35:22.266]  They're seeing what we're talking about.
[02:35:22.266 --> 02:35:30.552]  And, you know, I get mad at police all the time because they're where the rubber meets the road, but cops on average are waking up faster than the public.
[02:35:30.552 --> 02:35:31.933]  I'm getting chills right now.
[02:35:31.933 --> 02:35:32.573]  I really am.
[02:35:32.573 --> 02:35:34.415]  I mean, this stuff is making me sick.
[02:35:35.390 --> 02:35:45.092]  Because it's like watching a child tied up in the middle of the road and knowing a car is going to come by and run him over and you're tied up to a tree and you can't save him.
[02:35:45.092 --> 02:35:46.393]  Or a child on a train track.
[02:35:46.393 --> 02:35:51.454]  And zombies are walking by and you're like, untie me or untie that child.
[02:35:51.454 --> 02:35:55.615]  And they look at you and you're all tied up and the kid's tied up and they go, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[02:35:55.615 --> 02:35:58.596]  I heard if anybody was tied to the tracks it was a conspiracy theory.
[02:35:58.596 --> 02:36:01.337]  You're like, look, it's a child on the train track.
[02:36:01.337 --> 02:36:02.517]  I'm tied up here to this tree.
[02:36:03.337 --> 02:36:04.758]  Just, it's a real train track.
[02:36:04.758 --> 02:36:06.238]  You know trains come down this, right?
[02:36:06.238 --> 02:36:09.380]  And they're like, I was told about people like you.
[02:36:09.380 --> 02:36:15.743]  And I'm just like... I mean, it is a spiritual delusion.
[02:36:15.743 --> 02:36:17.464]  I mean, you heard Dr. Busby last hour.
[02:36:17.464 --> 02:36:19.565]  I mean, he's saying it's like people are zombies or something.
[02:36:19.565 --> 02:36:21.906]  It is crazy!
[02:36:21.906 --> 02:36:24.167]  It is crazy!
[02:36:24.167 --> 02:36:27.208]  And I was just here in the break reading a document about weaponized cancer.
[02:36:27.208 --> 02:36:30.070]  They put it in the stinking polio vaccines and got caught!
[02:36:32.233 --> 02:36:35.776]  Your grandma, your grandpa's, my grandma's grandpa's dying of cancer.
[02:36:35.776 --> 02:36:38.219]  They killed them, folks!
[02:36:38.219 --> 02:36:42.423]  Cancer in the last 10 years is up 2,000 fold in many types.
[02:36:42.423 --> 02:36:44.845]  In the last 50... I'm gonna go to Lindsey Williams.
[02:36:44.845 --> 02:36:45.465]  I apologize.
[02:36:45.465 --> 02:36:50.090]  It's just I was reading this document during the break and it's just, it's, it's really getting to me.
[02:36:50.090 --> 02:36:53.073]  It's really getting to me.
[02:36:53.073 --> 02:36:55.295]  And... Alright, we're gonna...
[02:36:57.363 --> 02:37:00.184]  We're going to go back to Lindsey Williams here.
[02:37:00.184 --> 02:37:07.188]  If you want to support us, until the end of the year, we're offering the Everything Special, all 18 of my films, 70 plus percent off, so that's $360.
[02:37:07.188 --> 02:37:09.669]  All 18 of them on DVD or $99.95.
[02:37:09.669 --> 02:37:11.170]  Great way to wake folks up.
[02:37:11.170 --> 02:37:18.593]  We've got all these other great videos we carry, like Oklahoma City, The Noble Lie, proving that was a false flag inside job.
[02:37:18.593 --> 02:37:23.615]  And when you realize the feds bombed those little kids on purpose, I mean, these are not feds.
[02:37:23.615 --> 02:37:24.296]  These are demons.
[02:37:27.284 --> 02:37:29.653]  People say, well, they're so dangerous, why are you resisting them?
[02:37:29.653 --> 02:37:30.778]  Aren't you scared?
[02:37:30.778 --> 02:37:32.364]  I'm scared of this continuing.
[02:37:33.317 --> 02:37:37.600]  Separately, I was asking Lindsey, because he's not here to plug his books and videos today.
[02:37:37.600 --> 02:37:40.682]  I drug him on the show, but I said, look, people need to get this information.
[02:37:40.682 --> 02:37:51.689]  2012, the beginning of the end, is his three DVD set where he breaks a lot of this down in true detail without myself and the calls and everything and the breaks interrupting him.
[02:37:51.689 --> 02:37:55.652]  Go to prophecyclub.com with the great work they do there to get all of his materials or 888-799-6111.
[02:37:55.652 --> 02:37:55.972]  888-799-6111.
[02:37:55.972 --> 02:37:57.273]  They got a lot of other material as well.
[02:38:03.397 --> 02:38:05.638]  It's important with all these moves towards censorship.
[02:38:05.638 --> 02:38:12.941]  They start a nuclear war, they start a bigger war, they claim a cyber attack and shut the web down from general public, and their plans are public.
[02:38:12.941 --> 02:38:26.607]  It's to wire everything into government sites where every major site gives you a government message and only affiliated groups like Fox and CNN will be allowed to stay up and then they'll have the government messages as well packaged by them.
[02:38:26.607 --> 02:38:27.428]  That's why you've seen
[02:38:29.042 --> 02:38:40.186]  Woodchuckabee, with the Woodchuck Show, posing as a Christian conservative on Fox, come out and say Obama's a Christian loving patriot who loves America.
[02:38:40.186 --> 02:38:49.669]  I was told by high up Fox people before my sources all dried up, because I was allowed to talk about it, I never gave particulars, but they figured out who the two sources were and they're gone.
[02:38:49.669 --> 02:38:50.229]  They're shut down.
[02:38:51.647 --> 02:39:01.693]  That about a year ago, they were told, we're turning the direction, we're going to start backing Obama, because we're circling the wagons.
[02:39:01.693 --> 02:39:03.214]  And you're going to start noticing that.
[02:39:03.214 --> 02:39:06.196]  I mean, this is so disgusting.
[02:39:06.196 --> 02:39:07.497]  Okay, side issue.
[02:39:07.497 --> 02:39:10.339]  I wanted to finish his other point, so we're going to go to your calls.
[02:39:10.339 --> 02:39:18.504]  It's just that the whole system is circling the wagons right now, because as Lindsey breaks down this speech,
[02:39:19.434 --> 02:39:22.095]  That his elitist friend said, look at this, this is what we're going to do.
[02:39:22.095 --> 02:39:26.718]  It's just total confirmation of a total devaluation and what that means.
[02:39:26.718 --> 02:39:37.663]  It means hyperinflation with a physical depression, the perfect storm, the royal flush, the creme de la creme of the creme de la creme.
[02:39:38.855 --> 02:39:48.765]  of economic disaster with half the public, a bunch of spoiled rotten jellyfish who don't want to work, the other half of us carrying everybody on our backs.
[02:39:48.765 --> 02:39:55.971]  It is going to be, if we don't avert this, it is going to be hellish with a capital H. Lindsey, I'm sorry I'm ranting.
[02:39:55.971 --> 02:39:59.215]  A lot of this is a little bit of overdrive here to finish with the call, but I want to go to the calls.
[02:39:59.215 --> 02:40:00.456]  Finish your other two points, please.
[02:40:02.161 --> 02:40:08.605]  In 35 years, everything that the elite have ever told me, it has happened exactly as they said it.
[02:40:08.605 --> 02:40:13.688]  You've heard me come on the Alex Jones Show and say it, and that's exactly the way it happened.
[02:40:13.688 --> 02:40:15.989]  Please write this date down.
[02:40:15.989 --> 02:40:18.511]  I'm begging you to go and read this speech.
[02:40:18.511 --> 02:40:25.335]  The date was November the 21st, 2002, when Ben Bernanke gave a speech before the National
[02:40:26.144 --> 02:40:29.405]  Economist Club of Washington, D.C.
[02:40:29.405 --> 02:40:47.129]  He said, if I am ever faced with another Great Depression, which he was immediately after he came in as Federal Reserve Chairman, the housing bubble had burst, the economy was in shambles, the unemployment rate was going through the roof, he said, I will do five things.
[02:40:47.975 --> 02:40:51.637]  He said, first of all, I would bring interest rates to zero.
[02:40:51.637 --> 02:40:55.740]  Look back at the last four or five years, he did exactly what he said.
[02:40:55.740 --> 02:41:00.963]  He said, secondly, I would buy securities from the banks to expand the federal balance sheet.
[02:41:00.963 --> 02:41:02.944]  You're going to have to digest that one a while.
[02:41:02.944 --> 02:41:04.285]  All of you out there, please do.
[02:41:04.285 --> 02:41:07.587]  He said, number three, I would increase the money supply.
[02:41:07.587 --> 02:41:16.173]  That's exactly what he did after bringing the interest rates to zero, after buying securities in order to expand the federal balance sheet.
[02:41:16.753 --> 02:41:22.014]  Then he increased the money supply exactly as he said in the speech he would.
[02:41:22.014 --> 02:41:27.116]  And number four, he said, I will buy our country's debt.
[02:41:27.116 --> 02:41:29.656]  QE1, QE2.
[02:41:29.656 --> 02:41:32.437]  He bought our country's debt beginning one year ago.
[02:41:32.437 --> 02:41:41.859]  Mr. Trump had warned me three years ago that whenever this happened, or about two and a half years ago, he warned me that whenever this happened, it was the end of the dollar.
[02:41:41.859 --> 02:41:43.560]  I didn't understand what he was saying.
[02:41:43.560 --> 02:41:44.680]  I see it readily now.
[02:41:45.380 --> 02:41:49.143]  And then Mr. Bernanke said, I will do a fifth thing.
[02:41:49.143 --> 02:41:56.808]  Now the first four, I have mentioned to you, he has done them in the exact order, precisely as he said he would.
[02:41:56.808 --> 02:41:59.830]  He did not change one thing from his speech.
[02:41:59.830 --> 02:42:01.711]  You've got to wade through that speech.
[02:42:01.711 --> 02:42:03.812]  It'll take you hours to do it.
[02:42:03.812 --> 02:42:09.336]  Whatever you do, you'll understand he did the first four in the exact order.
[02:42:09.336 --> 02:42:13.799]  Now, here's what came in, what happened to me just a matter of days ago.
[02:42:15.003 --> 02:42:21.148]  My elitist friends, and again, they're old.
[02:42:21.148 --> 02:42:23.710]  They're clearing their conscience, I believe.
[02:42:23.710 --> 02:42:30.855]  You've got to go to Bernanke's speech of 2002, and you will know what's going to happen next.
[02:42:30.855 --> 02:42:33.837]  And right now, I'm going to tell you what's going to happen next.
[02:42:33.837 --> 02:42:38.741]  I'll tell you exactly how much they're going to do it, and I'll tell you the method they'll use.
[02:42:39.526 --> 02:42:46.155]  And you'll see it, because Bernanke gave it, and when you read his speech, it'll send cold shields up and down your spine, I do believe.
[02:42:46.155 --> 02:42:52.082]  Mr. Bernanke said, the fifth thing I will do, and of course you know the economy is not getting any better.
[02:42:52.082 --> 02:42:54.766]  The housing market is in shambles.
[02:42:54.766 --> 02:42:57.149]  The unemployment rate is continuing to climb.
[02:42:58.305 --> 02:43:04.967]  They just gave $600 billion over Christmas to the EU.
[02:43:04.967 --> 02:43:07.008]  China and Japan just made a pact.
[02:43:07.008 --> 02:43:11.769]  Folks, do you realize what happened while you were having Christmas and getting ready for New Year's?
[02:43:11.769 --> 02:43:17.311]  China and Japan just signed the largest trade agreement ever signed in the history of the world.
[02:43:17.311 --> 02:43:18.791]  You heard me correctly.
[02:43:18.791 --> 02:43:20.772]  Ever in the history of the world.
[02:43:20.772 --> 02:43:23.453]  And they said, we will trade amongst ourselves.
[02:43:23.453 --> 02:43:27.334]  China and Japan, the second and third largest economies in the world.
[02:43:27.854 --> 02:43:32.816]  We will trade amongst ourselves and we will not use the dollar.
[02:43:32.816 --> 02:43:34.637]  Folks, are you getting the message?
[02:43:34.637 --> 02:43:36.537]  Okay, number five.
[02:43:36.537 --> 02:43:46.681]  Mr. Bernanke said, if I am faced with a continual depression, he said, I will... I don't even want to say it.
[02:43:46.681 --> 02:43:48.162]  It scares me.
[02:43:48.162 --> 02:43:51.743]  He said, I will devalue the dollar.
[02:43:52.708 --> 02:43:53.409]  Oh my goodness.
[02:43:53.409 --> 02:43:55.351]  Folks, please.
[02:43:55.351 --> 02:43:55.831]  Alright.
[02:43:55.831 --> 02:43:57.252]  He said how he was going to do it.
[02:43:57.252 --> 02:44:01.656]  I'm going to read you a portion of his actual statement.
[02:44:01.656 --> 02:44:03.698]  You're going to read the entire speech for yourself.
[02:44:03.698 --> 02:44:04.319]  You've got to.
[02:44:05.157 --> 02:44:10.643]  And I want to read you just one sentence out of his speech.
[02:44:10.643 --> 02:44:16.189]  He said, it's worth noting, now these are his exact words in that speech in 2002.
[02:44:16.189 --> 02:44:23.517]  He said, it's worth noting that there have been times when exchange rate policy has been an effective weapon.
[02:44:24.281 --> 02:44:26.521]  A striking example from U.S.
[02:44:26.521 --> 02:44:36.823]  history is Franklin Delano Roosevelt's 40% devaluation of the dollar against the gold in 1933 and 34.
[02:44:36.823 --> 02:44:42.784]  Please, please, I beg of you folks, you are facing a currency devaluation.
[02:44:42.784 --> 02:44:48.385]  They said to me, go and look at Binack's speech and you'll know what's going to happen next.
[02:44:48.385 --> 02:44:50.886]  I did not say it was going to happen tomorrow.
[02:44:50.886 --> 02:44:52.846]  I did not say it was going to happen next month.
[02:44:53.226 --> 02:44:59.273]  It's in the works, they plan to do it, and I'll tell you how much they're going to devalue it.
[02:44:59.273 --> 02:45:00.234]  That's right!
[02:45:00.234 --> 02:45:05.079]  He actually stated in his speech how much he would devalue the currency.
[02:45:05.079 --> 02:45:06.000]  Are you ready?
[02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:08.682]  He said he would devalue it by 40%.
[02:45:08.682 --> 02:45:13.307]  Now how did FDR, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, do it in 1933 and 1934?
[02:45:15.269 --> 02:45:19.915]  You remember, he said, bring in your one ounce gold pieces.
[02:45:19.915 --> 02:45:24.521]  He said, I will give you $20 for them because stamped on that one ounce gold piece is $20.
[02:45:24.521 --> 02:45:27.365]  Old people were patriotic.
[02:45:27.365 --> 02:45:29.828]  Oh yes, we want to help back up our country.
[02:45:29.828 --> 02:45:32.592]  We want to help get the country out of the mess it's in.
[02:45:33.112 --> 02:45:47.920]  And within a few months' time, after the people turned in their one-ounce gold for a piece of paper, oh please, people, I'm begging of you, Mr. Fromm said to me, Chaplain, if it's written on a piece of paper, it's worth the paper it's written on.
[02:45:48.380 --> 02:45:57.045]  They brought in their one-ounce gold pieces, and they were given a piece of paper that said you can go back to the bank and get you a gold back for $20.
[02:45:57.045 --> 02:45:59.346]  No, I didn't say for $20.
[02:45:59.346 --> 02:46:04.229]  It just said we'll take them for $20, and they gave them a gold certificate piece of paper.
[02:46:04.229 --> 02:46:05.730]  Today, you don't even have that.
[02:46:05.730 --> 02:46:07.891]  You don't have anything but a Federal Reserve note today.
[02:46:07.891 --> 02:46:10.292]  It has no backing of gold or silver or anything else.
[02:46:11.773 --> 02:46:29.745]  Yes, so that's the type of stuff we're going to see and we're going to have to have you back up in the new year to break this down more.
[02:46:29.745 --> 02:46:40.613]  We've got to go to calls and get their perspective because I promised we would, but we had Gerald Cilente on yesterday and he directed us to a clip from three years ago of Biden and Corzine
[02:46:41.974 --> 02:46:46.727]  And in the speech he says, yeah, we had a meeting with the other bankers about a bank holiday.
[02:46:48.308 --> 02:46:50.390]  So they're certainly getting all of this ready.
[02:46:50.390 --> 02:46:54.032]  And again, a bank holiday, folks, is where they shut the banks down for a week or two.
[02:46:54.032 --> 02:46:59.496]  And when you come back, your dollar's been devalued in a giant step, not just incrementally.
[02:46:59.496 --> 02:47:01.678]  And the inflation's already out there.
[02:47:01.678 --> 02:47:03.239]  They're just putting out cook numbers.
[02:47:03.239 --> 02:47:09.964]  But if they're talking about really devaluing it, we're talking about a hamburger being $20 instead of $5.
[02:47:09.964 --> 02:47:13.346]  You know, when a hamburger was $2 ten years ago.
[02:47:14.397 --> 02:47:18.598]  We're talking about massive wealth redistribution.
[02:47:18.598 --> 02:47:21.900]  We're talking about destruction of those on fixed incomes.
[02:47:21.900 --> 02:47:23.120]  It's just unspeakable.
[02:47:23.120 --> 02:47:24.821]  Let's go to phone calls here.
[02:47:24.821 --> 02:47:29.422]  And I guess Chris in California has been holding the longest.
[02:47:29.422 --> 02:47:30.723]  You're on the air with our guest.
[02:47:30.723 --> 02:47:31.143]  Go ahead.
[02:47:31.143 --> 02:47:33.263]  Yeah.
[02:47:33.263 --> 02:47:34.844]  Hi, Lindsay and Alex.
[02:47:34.844 --> 02:47:35.844]  This is Chris.
[02:47:35.844 --> 02:47:39.706]  I had a question maybe either you could answer.
[02:47:39.706 --> 02:47:42.147]  I've been looking into this case.
[02:47:42.147 --> 02:47:43.287]  You've probably heard of it where
[02:47:44.299 --> 02:47:57.652]  There's about a month ago there was a case filed against some of these big names like the United Nations, Bankai Moon, Berlusconi,
[02:47:58.360 --> 02:48:06.003]  And I think it's been largely going around the internet out of Benjamin Fulford.
[02:48:06.003 --> 02:48:07.544]  Yeah, I've gotten calls about this.
[02:48:07.544 --> 02:48:09.385]  Have you called before or was it somebody else?
[02:48:09.385 --> 02:48:11.405]  No, I haven't called before.
[02:48:11.405 --> 02:48:14.967]  Yeah, you know, we'll work on getting Fulford on to hear about his suit.
[02:48:14.967 --> 02:48:19.969]  I haven't had time to go to the lawsuit tracker and see if that's a real case.
[02:48:19.969 --> 02:48:22.570]  What's the name of the case?
[02:48:22.570 --> 02:48:26.692]  Well, you can look it up on PASTER case locator.
[02:48:28.021 --> 02:48:30.189]  Case number 1, colon, 2011, dash, CV.
[02:48:34.981 --> 02:48:39.523]  All right, I appreciate your call.
[02:48:39.523 --> 02:48:41.183]  I don't know what Lindsey can say about that.
[02:48:41.183 --> 02:48:43.784]  I don't know if he's aware of that particular statement.
[02:48:43.784 --> 02:48:50.126]  But yes, China and a lot of other groups have been suing different groups in China over the fact they've been sold derivatives.
[02:48:50.126 --> 02:48:55.107]  You've got Bank of America and others taking houses they never had the deed to that are paid for.
[02:48:55.107 --> 02:49:01.309]  So I guess the globalists kind of have to have a war, Lindsey, because they've cheated not just people, but countries.
[02:49:01.309 --> 02:49:03.130]  What does your latest source say about that?
[02:49:03.996 --> 02:49:05.477]  Well, he hasn't mentioned that at all.
[02:49:05.477 --> 02:49:22.723]  We've been talking so much about this currency devaluation here just recently, Alex, until I was so startled and unfounded and realized that everybody out there has 40% of everything that you own to be lost, until I haven't had time to do anything else with this and then do some research on what other nations did.
[02:49:23.243 --> 02:49:25.545]  Well, they're not going to call it that.
[02:49:25.545 --> 02:49:30.349]  Nowadays the mind control has gotten so intense, they'll call it an increase in the value or something.
[02:49:30.349 --> 02:49:31.530]  I mean, it's just untold evil.
[02:49:31.530 --> 02:49:32.992]  Let's talk to Nick in Illinois.
[02:49:32.992 --> 02:49:34.353]  Nick, you're on the air.
[02:49:34.353 --> 02:49:35.253]  Got a question for Lindsey?
[02:49:35.253 --> 02:49:35.514]  Yeah, Alex.
[02:49:35.514 --> 02:49:36.174]  I had a question.
[02:49:36.174 --> 02:49:37.095]  What does Lindsey think of
[02:49:51.425 --> 02:49:59.732]  Michael Rupert, he's the investigative journalist and he's the author of that movie, the Collapse movie, which talks about peak oil.
[02:49:59.732 --> 02:50:04.196]  Yeah, peak oil is as funny as a $3 bill from research.
[02:50:04.196 --> 02:50:06.378]  But what's your view on peak oil, Lindsey?
[02:50:07.133 --> 02:50:10.214]  Well, there is no such thing as peak oil.
[02:50:10.214 --> 02:50:11.595]  It's a total misnomer.
[02:50:11.595 --> 02:50:19.559]  When the Russians went down to drill that coal at SG3 Wells to 42,000 feet, they hit the mother lobe of all oil.
[02:50:19.559 --> 02:50:22.840]  It's not, it's abiotic oil.
[02:50:22.840 --> 02:50:23.981]  It has nothing to do with
[02:50:25.001 --> 02:50:30.426]  I'm sorry, but if a person believes in peak oil, all they gotta do is find out the very latest of what's going on.
[02:50:38.237 --> 02:50:41.819]  There's a lot of top scientists say it's not man-made.
[02:50:41.819 --> 02:50:44.040]  Now obviously you can find some deposits that are.
[02:50:44.040 --> 02:50:45.281]  It does exist.
[02:50:45.281 --> 02:50:49.243]  You can find coal that's got, you know, dinosaur bones in it or whatever.
[02:50:49.243 --> 02:50:51.244]  There's obviously some of that exists.
[02:50:51.244 --> 02:50:55.846]  There is some fossil fuel, but it's a very small amount of it.
[02:50:55.846 --> 02:50:59.348]  You know, I tell you what, we'll come back and let Nick have a response back to that.
[02:50:59.348 --> 02:51:00.229]  Then we'll go to everybody else.
[02:51:02.074 --> 02:51:05.457]  What nutrition are you missing that's leading to the four major diseases?
[02:51:05.457 --> 02:51:08.599]  Cancer, arthritis, heart disease, and Parkinson's.
[02:51:08.599 --> 02:51:23.910]  There are at least 80,000 medical studies that show a lack of the protein glutathione to be linked to cancer, heart disease, Parkinson's, macular degeneration, lung disease, digestive diseases, diabetes, Alzheimer's, ALS, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus.
[02:51:23.910 --> 02:51:24.890]  In all at least 68 diseases,
[02:51:25.831 --> 02:51:30.417]  What is the number one food by which your body is most empowered to increase its glutathione production?
[02:51:30.417 --> 02:51:33.881]  It is undamaged whey protein from grass-fed cows.
[02:51:33.881 --> 02:51:37.505]  One World Whey is truly the first undamaged whey protein.
[02:51:37.505 --> 02:51:41.170]  All other whey protein powders are damaged by heat, chemicals, and filtration.
[02:51:41.730 --> 02:51:42.291]  We're good to go.
[02:52:00.643 --> 02:52:01.943]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:52:01.943 --> 02:52:07.525]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:52:07.525 --> 02:52:12.547]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:52:12.547 --> 02:52:17.589]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:52:18.129 --> 02:52:23.353]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:52:23.353 --> 02:52:25.654]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[02:52:25.654 --> 02:52:30.457]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:52:30.457 --> 02:52:31.578]  And here's the best part.
[02:52:31.578 --> 02:52:34.660]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:52:34.660 --> 02:52:38.283]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:52:38.283 --> 02:52:41.465]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:52:41.465 --> 02:52:43.686]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:52:43.686 --> 02:52:44.607]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:52:48.249 --> 02:52:51.214]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:52:51.214 --> 02:52:57.325]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:52:57.325 --> 02:52:59.708]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:53:00.524 --> 02:53:07.867]  HempUSA.org has a revolutionary wonder food for detoxing the body and rebuilding the immune system.

[02:53:29.893 --> 02:53:31.134]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:53:31.134 --> 02:53:35.697]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:53:35.697 --> 02:53:41.521]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:53:41.521 --> 02:53:45.163]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:53:45.163 --> 02:53:47.985]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:53:47.985 --> 02:53:52.928]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:53:52.928 --> 02:53:53.229]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:53:53.229 --> 02:53:54.590]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:54:06.018 --> 02:54:12.863]  Alright, the official radio show is over in five minutes, but I'm going to do a little bit of overdrive for internet listeners at InfoWars.com with Lindsey Williams.
[02:54:15.640 --> 02:54:19.282]  We're going to have a very special InfoWars Nightly News tonight.
[02:54:19.282 --> 02:54:21.263]  The globalists are poisoning the food and water.
[02:54:21.263 --> 02:54:22.824]  We have all their documents.
[02:54:22.824 --> 02:54:29.788]  By all their documents, I'm sure we have a fraction of them, but we have giant stacks of the total proof of their wicked plan.
[02:54:29.788 --> 02:54:31.909]  We're all under attack by it.
[02:54:31.909 --> 02:54:36.892]  I know Dancing with the Stars is on, but this is the major issue.
[02:54:36.892 --> 02:54:41.475]  And I'm, again, not talking to our regular audience, but all the new listeners that tune in who may be laughing at this stuff.
[02:54:41.475 --> 02:54:43.716]  This is not a joke.
[02:54:43.716 --> 02:54:44.337]  It's not funny.
[02:54:45.855 --> 02:54:49.530]  Nick in Illinois, there's your answer on peak oil.
[02:54:51.606 --> 02:55:01.008]  You know, a lot of the globalists want to put up this idea that there's no resources so that when they cut them off and charge more for less, people will think it's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[02:55:01.008 --> 02:55:05.289]  This is part of a post-industrial move that's taking place.
[02:55:05.289 --> 02:55:06.770]  That's why they want to shut off coal.
[02:55:06.770 --> 02:55:10.931]  We have enough coal to run the planet for thousands of years and do it cleanly.
[02:55:10.931 --> 02:55:15.412]  All they put out is carbon dioxide, so then they list carbon dioxide as a toxic waste.
[02:55:15.412 --> 02:55:16.612]  You have any comments to that, Nick?
[02:55:17.409 --> 02:55:19.550]  I totally agree with you.
[02:55:19.550 --> 02:55:30.753]  I was just curious to see if you ever heard of Michael Rupert, because he has a compelling documentary back in 2009 called Collapse, and I just was curious to see if that's... No, I know Mike.
[02:55:30.753 --> 02:55:31.993]  I know Mike.
[02:55:31.993 --> 02:55:33.513]  Okay.
[02:55:33.513 --> 02:55:33.833]  Thank you.
[02:55:33.833 --> 02:55:34.634]  All right.
[02:55:34.634 --> 02:55:36.594]  Thank you so much.
[02:55:36.594 --> 02:55:39.435]  Let's go ahead and talk to another caller here.
[02:55:39.435 --> 02:55:41.995]  Let's talk to Deb in Illinois.
[02:55:41.995 --> 02:55:43.556]  You're on the air with our guest.
[02:55:44.540 --> 02:56:02.132]  Yes, I'm calling to inquire about the shelters and the provisions that people are taking for this type of event and I've run across one in particular and they have indicated that Lindsey has even endorsed it.
[02:56:02.132 --> 02:56:09.417]  I was very curious as to what his thought was on this and if those are pretty reasonable things to do.
[02:56:09.417 --> 02:56:11.519]  It's a natural shelter.
[02:56:13.004 --> 02:56:13.705]  I don't understand.
[02:56:13.705 --> 02:56:14.465]  Natural shelter?
[02:56:14.465 --> 02:56:16.727]  What are we talking about?
[02:56:16.727 --> 02:56:19.129]  We're talking a naturally occurring shelter.
[02:56:19.129 --> 02:56:21.031]  You're talking about caves?
[02:56:21.031 --> 02:56:22.772]  Lean-to's?
[02:56:22.772 --> 02:56:26.736]  Would be more in the area of a cave, yes.
[02:56:31.448 --> 02:56:34.290]  Well, Lindsey, have you talked about people having caves they can run to?
[02:56:34.290 --> 02:56:36.031]  Well, positively not.
[02:56:36.031 --> 02:56:38.773]  In fact, let me say emphatically I have endorsed nothing.
[02:56:38.773 --> 02:56:43.676]  Anyone out there who says I have endorsed any organization, any shelter,
[02:56:44.672 --> 02:56:51.234]  Any provision whatsoever, apart from what you hear me say right here on the Alex Jones Show, I did not endorse it.
[02:56:51.234 --> 02:56:52.454]  I do not endorse anything.
[02:56:52.454 --> 02:56:58.155]  I've had two big organizations ask me to be on their board within the past two months.
[02:56:58.155 --> 02:56:59.615]  I turned both of them down.
[02:56:59.615 --> 02:57:00.836]  I don't do that.
[02:57:00.836 --> 02:57:03.296]  The only thing I endorse is what the elite have told me.
[02:57:03.296 --> 02:57:04.056]  I know it's true.
[02:57:04.056 --> 02:57:07.597]  I tell it on the Alex Jones Show, and that's the only thing I endorse.
[02:57:07.597 --> 02:57:10.698]  I may agree with some of those, but I've never said it over radio talk shows.
[02:57:12.756 --> 02:57:21.958]  Yeah, my whole issue is that this depression's gonna get bad in places like New York City, places like that, bad areas of Chicago.
[02:57:21.958 --> 02:57:24.559]  Yeah, I've moved to the countryside.
[02:57:24.559 --> 02:57:29.060]  But as long as you're ready to take care of yourself, you should be okay.
[02:57:29.060 --> 02:57:35.542]  And if enough people wake up, that's the only thing that's made these globalists change their plans and back off.
[02:57:35.542 --> 02:57:39.583]  If enough people wake up, Lindsey, is it ever too late to get them to pull back?
[02:57:40.805 --> 02:57:45.110]  No, you can definitely get them to pull back, and that's the reason I'm on your show today, Alex.
[02:57:45.110 --> 02:57:49.074]  You've got a coverage of probably 2 million listeners right now while we're talking.
[02:57:49.074 --> 02:57:56.802]  These people have got to know, you must know what to do according to Ben Bernanke's speech on November 21, 2002.
[02:57:56.802 --> 02:58:01.107]  People, please, you can take precautionary action right now.
[02:58:02.367 --> 02:58:13.751]  I wish we had another whole hour, Alex, so I could suggest to them, according to what my elitist friends have told me, what they should do, and they should do it immediately, and it's different than anything I've talked about in the past.
[02:58:13.751 --> 02:58:16.052]  Well, I tell you what, we're going to do five more minutes.
[02:58:16.052 --> 02:58:20.133]  The main show's over, but Deb, did you have any other questions or comments?
[02:58:20.133 --> 02:58:28.356]  No, but I would really welcome his comments at some point in the future, quickly, about what provisions exactly he thinks we should take.
[02:58:29.361 --> 02:58:32.243]  Okay, well we'll get Lindsey's take on that straight ahead.
[02:58:32.243 --> 02:58:33.864]  That's it for the main radio show.
[02:58:33.864 --> 02:58:35.485]  See you back tomorrow live, 11 a.m.
[02:58:35.485 --> 02:58:37.587]  to 2 p.m., but we'll come back and take a few more calls.
[02:58:37.587 --> 02:58:38.767]  Internet only, straight ahead.
[02:58:38.767 --> 02:58:46.152]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.152 --> 02:58:47.253]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.308 --> 02:58:52.609]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:58:52.609 --> 02:58:58.211]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:58:58.211 --> 02:59:03.213]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:59:03.213 --> 02:59:08.255]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:59:08.795 --> 02:59:14.020]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:59:14.020 --> 02:59:16.342]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[02:59:16.342 --> 02:59:21.147]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:59:21.147 --> 02:59:22.268]  And here's the best part.
[02:59:22.268 --> 02:59:25.331]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:59:25.331 --> 02:59:28.614]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:59:28.934 --> 02:59:32.116]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:59:32.116 --> 02:59:34.337]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[02:59:34.337 --> 02:59:35.278]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:59:35.278 --> 02:59:35.478]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:59:35.478 --> 02:59:38.920]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:59:38.920 --> 02:59:40.661]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:59:52.031 --> 02:59:55.614]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.614 --> 02:59:58.817]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:22.478 --> 03:00:26.060]  Look, I wish I wasn't staring during the break at official U.S.
[03:00:26.060 --> 03:00:28.581]  government documents, cancer viruses, and the vaccines.
[03:00:28.581 --> 03:00:31.162]  I mean, those aren't just words.
[03:00:31.162 --> 03:00:38.046]  That's your mama, your daddy, your son, your daughter dying young, and a bunch of murder and scum that killed them.
[03:00:38.046 --> 03:00:43.448]  And I put out videos on this last night, and I see people going, well, there are too many people.
[03:00:43.448 --> 03:00:44.369]  What are you going to do?
[03:00:46.428 --> 03:00:47.890]  Well, then you kill yourself then.
[03:00:47.890 --> 03:00:55.459]  Do not sit there and jack kids' shots up with stuff that kills them, and then lecture me about how there's too many of us.
[03:00:55.459 --> 03:01:00.185]  Oh, but you're one of the ones that knows there's too many of us, so you've got to stay around to do the killing.
[03:01:00.185 --> 03:01:02.709]  All I've got to say is, is you people are going to be defeated.
[03:01:04.628 --> 03:01:11.233]  And, uh, going back to Lindsey Williams, uh, you know, they have the, it's a side issue, but they're like, how many, we're going to have 20 billion?
[03:01:11.233 --> 03:01:14.016]  The earth's population is going to plane off at eight and a half billion.
[03:01:14.016 --> 03:01:15.157]  Every actuary shows that.
[03:01:15.157 --> 03:01:22.543]  And then, and then, and then a real collapse starts because when you don't have as many young people as there are old people, you then can't take care of everybody.
[03:01:23.163 --> 03:01:25.024]  But you don't know about that, do you?
[03:01:25.024 --> 03:01:27.526]  You haven't actually studied population trends.
[03:01:27.526 --> 03:01:29.087]  You just shoot your mouths off!
[03:01:29.087 --> 03:01:30.868]  And I'm sorry, I'm reading their comments during the break.
[03:01:53.183 --> 03:01:58.506]  I've got a well, I've got a shotgun, a rifle, and a four-wheel drive, and a country boy will survive.
[03:01:58.506 --> 03:02:02.028]  I think it comes down to that, Lindsey.
[03:02:02.028 --> 03:02:04.710]  We need to do all of those things you just mentioned, Alex.
[03:02:04.710 --> 03:02:09.373]  We need to do everything that you've heard me say in the past, we need to do.
[03:02:09.373 --> 03:02:11.534]  You should have already done them.
[03:02:11.534 --> 03:02:17.918]  Everything on my new DVD series, which just came out 2012, the beginning of the end, you've got to do it.
[03:02:17.918 --> 03:02:20.980]  Now, let's come down to what I was given in the last few days.
[03:02:20.980 --> 03:02:22.641]  Mr. Bernanke said,
[03:02:23.539 --> 03:02:29.843]  I will, as not the last, the final straw, I will devaluate the currency.
[03:02:29.843 --> 03:02:33.065]  Now, how much did he say he would devalue it?
[03:02:33.065 --> 03:02:33.666]  30?
[03:02:33.666 --> 03:02:36.147]  He said he would devalue it 30%.
[03:02:36.147 --> 03:02:37.208]  It's there.
[03:02:37.208 --> 03:02:38.609]  He actually, okay.
[03:02:39.608 --> 03:02:40.749]  The elite.
[03:02:40.749 --> 03:02:43.974]  They will tell you in their buzzwords what they're going to do.
[03:02:43.974 --> 03:02:45.576]  Then they will do it.
[03:02:45.576 --> 03:02:51.062]  And then when you turn around and fuss after it's all over with, and Alex, I'm glad you're getting excited today.
[03:02:51.062 --> 03:02:52.524]  I feel the same way.
[03:02:52.524 --> 03:02:56.850]  And whenever the elite do this, and then you come back and fuss at them, and they say,
[03:02:57.550 --> 03:02:58.450]  What are you talking about?
[03:02:58.450 --> 03:02:59.110]  I told you!
[03:03:27.728 --> 03:03:34.272]  Hey Alex, Lindsey, I'm a PrisonPlanet.tv subscriber and I just want to say God bless you guys, that my wife and I pray for you guys often.
[03:03:34.272 --> 03:03:35.472]  Thank you.
[03:03:35.472 --> 03:03:40.255]  And I really don't want to take too much time, but I do have like four really quick questions.
[03:03:40.255 --> 03:03:40.915]  Go, go, head on.
[03:03:40.915 --> 03:03:42.396]  Kind of tie in with each other.
[03:03:42.396 --> 03:03:43.757]  Okay.
[03:03:43.757 --> 03:03:50.400]  Has your elite friend told you specifically, Lindsey, if there's going to be an attack against Syria prior to Iran?
[03:03:50.400 --> 03:03:53.802]  And did he give you a timeline of events leading up to an attack on Iran?
[03:03:54.597 --> 03:03:55.398]  Yes, he did.
[03:03:55.398 --> 03:04:00.501]  And if you would like that in a three-hour DVD presentation, I produced it nine months ago.
[03:04:00.501 --> 03:04:03.122]  It's entitled Middle East, the rest of the story.
[03:04:03.122 --> 03:04:05.064]  He told me every nation that would be attacked.
[03:04:05.064 --> 03:04:07.405]  He told me what order they'd be attacked in.
[03:04:07.405 --> 03:04:10.027]  He did say that Syria would come prior to Iran.
[03:04:10.027 --> 03:04:13.089]  He did say that Iran would be the last place to be.
[03:04:13.089 --> 03:04:16.671]  And by the way, you're on record before any of this started saying this, Lindsey.
[03:04:16.671 --> 03:04:18.412]  Let's get one more of those questions quickly.
[03:04:19.744 --> 03:04:23.127]  Okay, I actually want to do two more just about Russia and China.
[03:04:23.127 --> 03:04:24.367]  Yeah, bro, we only got 30 seconds.
[03:04:24.367 --> 03:04:26.529]  Oh, okay.
[03:04:26.529 --> 03:04:32.914]  Then, in reference to the Devil's Messiah, did he say anything about how they plan to destroy the morals of America specifically?
[03:04:33.570 --> 03:04:34.531]  Well, positively.
[03:04:34.531 --> 03:04:45.136]  In fact, in my latest DVD presentation, three hours of it, 2012, the beginning of the end, I describe it in about a 30-minute detail and even show you DVDs as to how they're going to do it.
[03:04:45.136 --> 03:04:49.118]  Look, Lindsey, I got the producer here right now and this caller.
[03:04:49.118 --> 03:04:53.981]  We obviously need to get you back on sometime this week for another hour or the first of the year.
[03:04:53.981 --> 03:04:54.741]  The show's over.
[03:04:54.741 --> 03:04:57.403]  I'll be back tonight at 7, back tomorrow at 11 a.m., Lord willing.
[03:04:57.403 --> 03:05:01.665]  But, Lindsey, let's set you up right now for another hour so we can answer more questions from callers.
