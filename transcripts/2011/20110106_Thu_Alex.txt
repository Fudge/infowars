[00:00:04.051 --> 00:00:04.692]  Big Brother.
[00:00:05.352 --> 00:00:06.393]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.113 --> 00:00:08.254]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:08.894 --> 00:00:09.694]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.475 --> 00:00:11.475]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.016 --> 00:00:15.638]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.218 --> 00:00:20.320]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.831 --> 00:00:34.214]  It is Thursday, the sixth day of January, 2011.
[00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:46.426]  In the fourth hour today, we're going to have Pierce Corbin of Weather Action, a meteorologist who has a much more accurate long-term prediction.
[00:00:47.646 --> 00:01:10.176]  accuracy than mainline meteorologists and the climate tax fear-mongering authoritarians who are using the rescue the environment movement as a pretext to bring in an authoritarian surveillance system.
[00:01:11.348 --> 00:01:24.363]  He's going to be joining us today because in England and the United States, the press is having to admit that Mr. Corbyn was absolutely right a year ago when he said that 2010-2011 would be an incredibly cold winter.
[00:01:27.887 --> 00:01:32.269]  And he predicted that for the previous winter 2009 into 2010.
[00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.890]  He'll be joining us coming up in the fourth hour today.
[00:01:37.851 --> 00:01:48.415]  Alan Watt will be joining us in the third hour today to go over the latest news and developments on a host of important issues.
[00:01:49.656 --> 00:02:03.252]  Coming up in 30 minutes, I'm going to break down some very important information dealing with the nature of the New World Order, the scientific dictatorship, and their plan.
[00:02:04.665 --> 00:02:08.349]  Uh, to complete this dystopic system that they've been constructing.
[00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:13.134]  Right now, they're very busy branding dystopia as good.
[00:02:13.655 --> 00:02:15.477]  As 1984 as good.
[00:02:15.497 --> 00:02:22.665]  Uh, that murdering children, blowing them up, uh, if they don't submit to carbon taxes, as good.
[00:02:23.185 --> 00:02:24.447]  It's the Overton window.
[00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:43.682]  Where they are conditioning people with mainline news and media promoting outrageously insane things, knowing that most people are peer-pressure driven, don't have original thoughts in their head, and just like with the Aztecs, hey, our government says we sacrifice children and then eat them.
[00:02:44.543 --> 00:02:46.964]  Or the Babylonians, similar things.
[00:02:47.225 --> 00:02:48.065]  Or the Canaanites.
[00:02:48.465 --> 00:02:50.007]  Or the ancient Druids.
[00:02:50.747 --> 00:02:51.348]  Same system.
[00:02:52.148 --> 00:03:00.052]  And really, it's the psychopaths on top testing their total power, their total control, so that when they say, jump, you say, how high?
[00:03:00.953 --> 00:03:05.295]  And so they're just coming right out with amazing, amazing statements.
[00:03:05.875 --> 00:03:21.263]  Paul Watson has an article on it, Plannedopolis, Elitist Agenda for Eco-Enslavement, and we're going to play this government-funded, they're also teamed up with the London Guardian, production, where you think it's a joke,
[00:03:22.318 --> 00:03:30.900]  I mean, they're talking about total surveillance, total rationing, lockdown cities, prison grid, which is the official UN plan.
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.360]  You notice that's in many of my films.
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.861]  For over 15 years I've been talking about it, because I'm reading their own plans.
[00:03:36.121 --> 00:03:44.503]  But this is going from the academic into the smart growth publicly, where they're saying total tyranny is good.
[00:03:45.805 --> 00:03:55.952]  And you watch it, and it seems like some type of dystopic Monty Python episode, or Brazil, or 1984.
[00:03:56.092 --> 00:03:56.932]  But it's not!
[00:03:58.553 --> 00:04:00.755]  Or Gattaca, or Brave New World.
[00:04:01.595 --> 00:04:03.556]  This is what they're really pushing.
[00:04:03.596 --> 00:04:05.778]  And so now, they're laying it all out.
[00:04:05.838 --> 00:04:06.678]  How wonderful!
[00:04:06.718 --> 00:04:08.660]  We're going to murder you if you don't submit!
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.001]  Oh, you don't want to submit to carbon taxes?
[00:04:11.061 --> 00:04:11.381]  Fine!
[00:04:11.401 --> 00:04:13.143]  Hits the button, blows the children up.
[00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:17.283]  When you watch this video and hear the audio that's coming up, it's going to blow you away.
[00:04:17.303 --> 00:04:31.741]  And I'm going to analyze that, and then I'm going to play a clip of Endgame, just three minutes in after the intro of the film, the first several minutes of the film proper, where I lay out exactly what they say, but I'm saying it's bad.
[00:04:33.183 --> 00:04:36.805]  They're saying it's good, and I'm going to play their clip, so you get an idea of this.
[00:04:37.125 --> 00:04:44.610]  We'll also cue up the commercial that they're airing in movie theaters, where it shows the school teacher murdering small children.
[00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.231]  And this is hailed as good.
[00:04:47.052 --> 00:04:51.234]  And see then, the general public only follows fads, the new style is murdering children.
[00:04:51.494 --> 00:04:54.536]  They go, you're such an extremist, you don't want to murder people for Earth?
[00:04:55.197 --> 00:04:55.957]  This is 21st century Nazism.
[00:05:00.063 --> 00:05:02.666]  Hello this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:05:03.087 --> 00:05:08.033]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:05:08.413 --> 00:05:10.135]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:05:10.456 --> 00:05:15.281]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:05:15.462 --> 00:05:15.822]  How much do
[00:05:15.862 --> 00:05:16.402]  What do you want?
[00:05:16.622 --> 00:05:17.383]  When do you want it?
[00:05:17.743 --> 00:05:19.344]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:05:19.624 --> 00:05:20.464]  When will you need it?
[00:05:20.704 --> 00:05:22.785]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:05:22.905 --> 00:05:24.006]  Will there be any food?
[00:05:24.246 --> 00:05:25.587]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:05:25.787 --> 00:05:30.849]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:05:31.049 --> 00:05:34.231]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:05:34.631 --> 00:05:38.093]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:05:38.433 --> 00:05:39.434]  How much will you need?
[00:05:39.674 --> 00:05:40.274]  We don't know.
[00:05:40.574 --> 00:05:41.475]  How much do you want?
[00:05:41.675 --> 00:05:42.416]  All you can get.
[00:05:42.616 --> 00:05:43.456]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:43.696 --> 00:05:46.458]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:05:46.758 --> 00:05:48.940]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:49.960]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:05:59.056 --> 00:06:03.279]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:04.200]  Number 1.
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.662]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:06:07.943 --> 00:06:08.483]  Number 2.
[00:06:08.803 --> 00:06:13.347]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:06:13.687 --> 00:06:14.127]  It's true.
[00:06:14.427 --> 00:06:18.991]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:06:19.311 --> 00:06:19.831]  Number 3.
[00:06:20.132 --> 00:06:23.414]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:06:23.714 --> 00:06:27.417]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:06:27.617 --> 00:06:28.158]  Number 4.
[00:06:28.418 --> 00:06:30.780]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.564]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:06:34.844 --> 00:06:35.064]  Number 5.
[00:06:35.645 --> 00:06:39.568]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:06:39.788 --> 00:06:44.553]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:06:44.833 --> 00:06:48.860]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.563]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:50.803 --> 00:06:52.867]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:06:53.047 --> 00:06:55.391]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:06:58.953 --> 00:07:00.554]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:07:00.594 --> 00:07:03.417]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.
[00:07:03.977 --> 00:07:08.901]  This is an American made product of the highest quality and compares to nothing you will find in stores.
[00:07:09.201 --> 00:07:12.364]  You can buy factory direct, shipped via UPS right to your door.
[00:07:12.644 --> 00:07:14.986]  Check them out on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[00:07:15.606 --> 00:07:16.467]  Or call 800-340-7091.
[00:07:19.129 --> 00:07:20.090]  Take my word for it.
[00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:22.591]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[00:07:22.932 --> 00:07:29.136]  Since 1947, Calvin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[00:07:29.437 --> 00:07:30.838]  Buy American and stay clean.

[00:07:57.244 --> 00:07:57.664]  Thank you.
[00:07:59.566 --> 00:08:04.489]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:04.809 --> 00:08:07.111]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:19.369 --> 00:08:23.230]  We've got Elon Musk joining us coming up in about an hour and 52 minutes from now.
[00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:29.452]  Then we'll go into overdrive of the fourth hour with Piers Corbin, meteorologist, who's getting his due.
[00:08:30.092 --> 00:08:38.575]  And mainstream media from Europe to the United States is admitting that he has stunning accuracy when compared to mainline meteorologists.
[00:08:39.215 --> 00:08:42.896]  And he follows the ancient systems of the moon.
[00:08:44.624 --> 00:08:49.487]  The ancients didn't know why weather was so closely associated with the moon.
[00:08:49.527 --> 00:08:50.528]  They just knew it was.
[00:08:51.048 --> 00:08:59.614]  And now we know that a lot of our weather, one of the big inputs, one of the largest, most important inputs, is solar winds.
[00:09:00.174 --> 00:09:18.604]  The different ions, the different particles, the micrometeorites, all of it, coming in out of the solar winds over the Earth and its magnetic field, and that when the Moon is between the Earth and the Sun, or not between the Earth and the Sun, it has a massive effect on what's coming into the atmosphere.
[00:09:19.164 --> 00:09:34.247]  Then, one of the other big feeds, or inputs, is the magnetics of the planet, from the core, affecting weather on the surface, because of the massive magnetic tectonic-type energies being released.
[00:09:34.907 --> 00:09:43.448]  Now, Mainline, give up your property for the Earth, give everything to Al Gore, give everything to global government, collectivize everything.
[00:09:44.049 --> 00:09:45.869]  They tell you that has nothing to do with it.
[00:09:46.983 --> 00:09:48.944]  Okay, that's mainline meteorology.
[00:09:49.144 --> 00:09:51.285]  Now all the other sciences, they know that.
[00:09:51.765 --> 00:09:58.507]  People that study the sun and the moon and people that study the tectonic and magnetic forces, that's all well known.
[00:09:59.427 --> 00:10:09.851]  But these sciences are all very compartmentalized and they tend to only stick with whatever the original accepted ancient theories are, and so they stick with that.
[00:10:11.038 --> 00:10:11.959]  And it's pretty ridiculous.
[00:10:12.879 --> 00:10:18.584]  I did want to cover a couple of notes here because time gets away from me and I don't tend to cover it.
[00:10:19.344 --> 00:10:30.412]  I learned late last week that Aaron Zellman of Jews and Preservation of Firearms Ownership had passed and I wanted to properly eulogize him.
[00:10:31.673 --> 00:10:40.920]  Hopefully, later today I'll have time to read this article from Illinois Gunn posted at Infowars.com on December 31st, last Friday.
[00:10:41.921 --> 00:10:51.248]  Second Amendment champion Aaron Zellman passes and he did so much great work with his organization that will continue on for the Second Amendment.
[00:10:51.569 --> 00:10:58.874]  He was a great guy, one of our favorite guests on the Second Amendment, very informed, a real attack dog against the
[00:11:00.055 --> 00:11:29.678]  uh... gun grabbers uh... at uh... the b a t f uh... and the southern property loss center in a d l he really went after those guys and he will be a certainly missed in a real real warrior for liberty has passed but certainly passes on the torch to all of us will continue to carry on the fight for human liberty and not to be disarmed and be brought uh... into the place of total slaves and of course uh... we will continue on the fight for the second amendment uh... but uh... he he did die and then it wasn't publicly and uh...
[00:11:30.058 --> 00:11:30.519]  I don't know.
[00:11:51.789 --> 00:11:52.449]  Was a shock.
[00:11:52.970 --> 00:12:05.298]  I had a pang in me whenever I discovered that information because it also just illustrates how short life is and you think people that you've known are going to be around forever and then they just die.
[00:12:06.199 --> 00:12:12.023]  Another issue was I interviewed him just a few months before he died and he didn't tell anybody that he was so ill.
[00:12:13.018 --> 00:12:20.205]  That's another issue, so kind of the old-fashioned type guy that doesn't let anybody know what's going on with his health.
[00:12:20.505 --> 00:12:23.388]  So he's gone, but will not be forgotten.
[00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:35.661]  A month or so ago, I sent the crew up to Maine to interview Charlotte Isserby about the government's deliberate premeditated destruction of free speech.
[00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:48.188]  And of course, once they were up there, after the interview ended, she got into skull and bones, she got into a whole bunch of issues that her father and grandfather had been involved in, and also her father's visit with Bohemian Grove.
[00:12:48.708 --> 00:12:59.716]  And I dispatched the guys back there, and they interviewed her again yesterday to get that data, so we can put it on PrisonPlanet.tv for the members, and also condense it down into an upcoming film.
[00:13:00.136 --> 00:13:01.217]  And she gave us a gift!
[00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:03.290]  Charlotte Isserby gave us a gift.
[00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:11.912]  You know, we're really interviewing her a lot because she's 80 years old now and is pretty much going to ride off into the sunset, at least for the foreseeable future.
[00:13:12.552 --> 00:13:26.256]  And so we're ensuring that that information is archived and prominently forwarded to the current generation and to future generations, because she was the head of policy number two overall at the Department of Education under Reagan.
[00:13:26.276 --> 00:13:31.497]  And it was just openly discussed in the bureaucracy that they are training people to not be able to think,
[00:13:32.037 --> 00:13:33.017]  And dumbing people down.
[00:13:34.138 --> 00:13:37.318]  And of course, when she talked about it 20 years ago, she got laughed at, even though she had the documents.
[00:13:37.679 --> 00:13:40.799]  Now it's such mainstream news and information.
[00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.000]  But she gave us a little gift here.
[00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:54.663]  And I guess if I can decorate my office with this, we'll scan this in and write a little blurb about it in the next few days and put it up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:13:54.963 --> 00:13:57.784]  But if you are a PrisonPlanet.tv viewer, you can see it right now.
[00:13:58.824 --> 00:14:00.225]  It's a main license plate.
[00:14:01.451 --> 00:14:09.163]  And it's a white license plate with a evergreen pine tree and a forest in the background.
[00:14:09.984 --> 00:14:12.808]  And it's a Maine license plate she had a few years ago.
[00:14:12.828 --> 00:14:15.452]  It says Ron Paul Vacationland.
[00:14:16.392 --> 00:14:30.968]  But she was able to get the license plate Ron Paul and she made the joke that once the MIAC report came out saying that if you have a Ron Paul bumper sticker go ahead and pull you over because you're probably a terrorist or if you also have an American flag.
[00:14:32.389 --> 00:14:33.990]  Or you're a returning veteran or gun owner.
[00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:41.072]  And so she made the joke that she went ahead and got rid of her Ron Paul personalized license plate and gave it to us as a little memento.
[00:14:41.373 --> 00:14:43.073]  So we appreciate Charlotte Isenberg giving us that.
[00:14:43.413 --> 00:14:47.835]  By the way, she is going to be joining us Friday, correct, Jaren?
[00:14:49.296 --> 00:14:50.136]  She's on the show Friday?
[00:15:02.282 --> 00:15:02.702]  Oh, okay.
[00:15:04.302 --> 00:15:06.583]  Well, no, I think he told me that she's on Friday.
[00:15:06.603 --> 00:15:09.904]  I mean, I think that's in the schedule, so I was just asking.
[00:15:13.464 --> 00:15:14.485]  Yeah, no, I understand.
[00:15:16.965 --> 00:15:19.566]  Anyway, she's going to be on the show Friday, I believe.
[00:15:23.126 --> 00:15:25.987]  Also, we've got some other special guests coming up.
[00:15:26.946 --> 00:15:30.927]  Next week, we're going to get her to pop back on the broadcast tomorrow.
[00:15:31.848 --> 00:15:40.971]  Dovetailing in with Paul Joseph Watson's article, eco-fascists call for prison cities.
[00:15:42.835 --> 00:15:46.818]  Watson wrote a great informative article that's more detailed.
[00:15:47.218 --> 00:15:50.160]  Plannedopolis, elitist agenda for eco-enslavement.
[00:15:50.501 --> 00:15:57.626]  I'm going to cover that in deep detail coming up in about 15 minutes when we start the bottom of the hour segment.
[00:15:57.966 --> 00:16:11.916]  But I called Watson this morning and I said, look, I want to integrate this in with the fact that this is literally the facelift, the 2.0 version of the scientific eugenics dictatorship.
[00:16:13.439 --> 00:16:19.242]  And that in their own UN admissions, and the State Department ran them 200 and others, they admit they are building a prison planet.
[00:16:19.623 --> 00:16:21.984]  That's why we have PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:16:22.364 --> 00:16:26.386]  That's why I call it a prison planet in Road to Tyranny, that I released in 2002.
[00:16:26.747 --> 00:16:33.911]  That's why the 2007 film, Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement, released almost four years ago, begins with the prison planet.
[00:16:34.511 --> 00:16:35.752]  You will be locked down.
[00:16:35.832 --> 00:16:39.153]  You will be allowed to have one child, if you can pay all the taxes.
[00:16:39.653 --> 00:16:41.254]  You will be completely enslaved.
[00:16:41.274 --> 00:16:43.535]  You will not be able to travel outside your neighborhood.
[00:16:43.895 --> 00:16:47.057]  There will be no travel allowed, but essential travel.
[00:16:47.357 --> 00:16:48.698]  And this is the stated plan.
[00:16:49.038 --> 00:16:50.178]  Rationing for everything.
[00:16:50.198 --> 00:16:50.799]  Total control.
[00:16:51.579 --> 00:17:00.048]  So I suggest that everyone tune in coming up in about 15 minutes and call everybody you know and tell them to tune in because this is the big enchilada.
[00:17:00.309 --> 00:17:03.713]  This is where we're going and this is not my opinion.
[00:17:03.733 --> 00:17:04.654]  I want to make that clear.
[00:17:05.955 --> 00:17:10.500]  It's like it's not my opinion they've had massive secret weather modification going on for more than 50 years.
[00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:12.722]  Now it's all being declassified in your face.
[00:17:13.735 --> 00:17:14.796]  Most of it weather weapons.
[00:17:15.516 --> 00:17:23.062]  It's not a secret that they're doing secret chemical, biological, radiological testing on the population.
[00:17:24.183 --> 00:17:26.965]  All of that is coming out in the open.
[00:17:27.225 --> 00:17:32.249]  And what they're doing is flaunting all of this until we just get acclimated.
[00:17:32.569 --> 00:17:40.495]  See, the general public, if they don't see people go to prison for spying on them without warrants, and they don't see people go into prison for shooting up
[00:17:41.095 --> 00:17:48.518]  Foster kids with pesticides and unapproved drugs and biologicals and chemicals and radiologicals.
[00:17:48.858 --> 00:18:08.285]  If they don't see people going to jail for stealing trillions of dollars, the private Federal Reserve, and not telling Congress where the money went, if they can put TV ads on showing children being murdered if they don't accept carbon taxes, and that's seen as moral now, and Jack Bauer tortures kids in front of their parents to get answers, and that's seen as moral,
[00:18:09.625 --> 00:18:12.207]  Then it becomes immoral to be against all that.
[00:18:12.567 --> 00:18:16.430]  And they know exactly what they are doing.
[00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:17.550]  Okay?
[00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:19.672]  They are warping us right now.
[00:18:20.272 --> 00:18:21.393]  They are warping us.
[00:18:21.513 --> 00:18:24.495]  And, you know, I say this is 21st century Nazism.
[00:18:24.735 --> 00:18:25.796]  That's not really right.
[00:18:26.436 --> 00:18:30.179]  But I use that as a term so the general public gets where I'm coming from.
[00:18:30.939 --> 00:18:33.841]  It's not fair to the Nazis.
[00:18:34.521 --> 00:18:35.582]  The Nazis were horrible.
[00:18:35.922 --> 00:18:38.064]  Eugenicists, globalists, the one-in-one world government.
[00:18:38.769 --> 00:18:42.131]  But A, it's not based in full reality.
[00:18:42.532 --> 00:18:49.677]  The Nazis were only an extension of the scientific dictatorship movement that was funded out of the U.S.
[00:18:49.897 --> 00:18:59.484]  and England into Germany on record by the Rockefeller Foundation, by the Saxe-Coburg Gothas, by the Huxleys, by the Wedgwoods, by the Darwins.
[00:19:00.405 --> 00:19:01.966]  They were the rock stars.
[00:19:02.346 --> 00:19:05.808]  You read any New York Times, Washington Post,
[00:19:08.109 --> 00:19:12.453]  Times of London, Financial Times, 1900, 1910, 1920s, 30s, up until 1940, Time Magazine, Life Magazine.
[00:19:12.473 --> 00:19:13.534]  It's all rock star eugenics, okay?
[00:19:22.662 --> 00:19:23.862]  They built our world.
[00:19:24.182 --> 00:19:25.183]  They made our world.
[00:19:25.563 --> 00:19:32.805]  The science of biometrics, the science of genetics, the science of computers, all of it was founded for eugenics.
[00:19:33.625 --> 00:19:35.006]  Everything is eugenics.
[00:19:35.626 --> 00:19:36.106]  Everything.
[00:19:36.406 --> 00:19:42.228]  Our entire civilization is built towards what they're now bringing us into the final phase of.
[00:19:43.148 --> 00:19:43.408]  Okay?
[00:19:43.428 --> 00:19:47.392]  Now that's the big, giant enchilada right there.
[00:19:48.093 --> 00:19:48.413]  Okay?
[00:19:49.054 --> 00:19:49.914]  You're in a kill grid.
[00:19:50.015 --> 00:19:50.795]  I'm in a kill grid.
[00:19:50.815 --> 00:19:52.777]  It's a scientific takeover program.
[00:19:52.937 --> 00:19:53.658]  They study us.
[00:19:55.099 --> 00:19:55.840]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:56.561 --> 00:19:57.462]  Knowing is half the battle.
[00:20:00.259 --> 00:20:02.139]  Not all protein supplements are created equal.
[00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:11.122]  One World Whey is the first cold-temperature-processed, 100% all-natural, unrefined, bioactive, grass-pasture-raised, milk-whey protein.
[00:20:11.522 --> 00:20:24.225]  Far from being another ordinary protein supplement, One World Whey is a full-spectrum nutrition power food in and of itself, providing overall life-building benefits that touch virtually every human's life, that other protein supplements don't deliver on.
[00:20:24.685 --> 00:20:25.485]  What are the benefits?
[00:20:25.865 --> 00:20:38.349]  Boosts the immune system, anti-aging properties, helps detoxification, helps reduce body fat, excellent for building lean muscle, increases energy levels, enhances the feelings of youth, sports performance, exercise recovery.
[00:20:38.889 --> 00:20:39.429]  Who's it for?
[00:20:39.809 --> 00:20:48.872]  Busy people, hard-working executives, students, teachers, active seniors, people recovering from illness, office workers, construction workers, and high-performance athletes.
[00:20:49.332 --> 00:20:54.915]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit oneworldway.com.
[00:20:54.955 --> 00:20:58.097]  That's oneworld, W-H-E-Y.com.
[00:20:59.137 --> 00:20:59.517]  Good day.
[00:20:59.757 --> 00:21:01.258]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:21:01.398 --> 00:21:01.919]  January 6th, 2011.
[00:21:02.079 --> 00:21:02.839]  Gold opened this morning at $1371.80.
[00:21:02.879 --> 00:21:05.961]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $1407.40, $703.70 for a half-ounce, or $351.85 for a quarter-ounce.
[00:21:05.981 --> 00:21:06.501]  That's $1407.40, $703.70, and $351.85.
[00:21:18.846 --> 00:21:22.608]  Again, the Congressional Budget Office sounds the alarm, warning of Greek-style U.S.
[00:21:22.669 --> 00:21:23.469]  debt crises.
[00:21:23.829 --> 00:21:25.931]  CBO is drawing a parallel between U.S.
[00:21:25.991 --> 00:21:28.112]  economy and the Greek economic meltdown.
[00:21:28.432 --> 00:21:33.455]  Debt to GDP climbing to unfamiliar territory and deficits rising to unsupportable levels.
[00:21:33.776 --> 00:21:40.520]  Hi, Ted Anderson, the Federal Debt and Risk of Financial Crises document the CBO has published is a must-read for every American.
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:46.544]  Covering the risks of deficit spending, aging population, and rising interest rates spells economic disaster.
[00:21:46.884 --> 00:21:47.525]  Call today at 800-686-2237.
[00:21:47.545 --> 00:21:48.245]  I'll send it free.
[00:21:48.285 --> 00:21:48.926]  Again, call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:48.986 --> 00:21:50.027]  Ask for the CBO document.
[00:21:50.047 --> 00:21:50.267]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:59.119 --> 00:22:01.441]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:22:01.501 --> 00:22:03.702]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:22:03.822 --> 00:22:06.604]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:22:07.044 --> 00:22:11.787]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:22:12.147 --> 00:22:16.330]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:18.994]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:22:19.114 --> 00:22:21.538]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:22:21.878 --> 00:22:24.462]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:22:24.802 --> 00:22:32.414]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:22:32.734 --> 00:22:37.997]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:22:38.017 --> 00:22:40.918]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:22:40.978 --> 00:22:44.400]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:45.580]  And I got news for you.
[00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:47.041]  You're everyone else.
[00:22:47.081 --> 00:22:48.061]  Invisible Empire.

[00:23:51.687 --> 00:23:53.328]  Totally Wicked E-Liquid Cigarettes.
[00:23:53.548 --> 00:23:55.830]  The next generation of alternative smoking.
[00:23:56.350 --> 00:24:04.935]  Pienso que un sueño parasito no volverá más.
[00:24:04.996 --> 00:24:10.059]  Que me pintaba las manos y la cara azul.
[00:24:18.141 --> 00:24:20.822]  So, I sit here every day and do the research.
[00:24:21.002 --> 00:24:29.145]  I make films, I do radio, TV interviews, and I know I'm 100% right about the globalists' own statements.
[00:24:30.846 --> 00:24:36.889]  And I have people like Nightline and others come here and laugh at me when I tell them there's a world government being set up.
[00:24:38.169 --> 00:24:41.211]  And they do TV specials saying I'm insane.
[00:24:42.591 --> 00:24:53.136]  Doesn't matter how many documents I have, what proof I have, I sit there and talk to adult men and women who have children, and I say, listen, I want to give you the Rockefeller documents where they're adding sterilists to the vaccines.
[00:24:53.437 --> 00:24:54.017]  They don't want them.
[00:24:54.617 --> 00:24:56.978]  Hey, I want to give you the State Department Miranda.
[00:24:57.779 --> 00:24:58.359]  They don't want it.
[00:24:58.839 --> 00:25:03.662]  Let me give you the Biological Diversity Assessment calling for 80% extermination.
[00:25:03.882 --> 00:25:04.402]  They don't want it.
[00:25:08.038 --> 00:25:22.291]  Because they've subconsciously made a decision, and then consciously made the decision, that they just want to think it's all about ball games and having fun and planning their vacation.
[00:25:22.631 --> 00:25:25.313]  It's all me, me, me, me, me, me.
[00:25:25.573 --> 00:25:31.519]  They're so selfish that their own future is being destroyed right in front of them.
[00:25:32.039 --> 00:25:35.062]  And their children's future, but they're so in the minute.
[00:25:37.383 --> 00:25:39.284]  That they can't think long-term.
[00:25:39.664 --> 00:25:52.909]  And the globalists are masters at making sure everything goes at a slow, phased-in pace, and every new phase of the enslavement is advertised and promoted and given cover stories.
[00:25:52.929 --> 00:25:55.530]  See, the general public is given cover stories.
[00:25:57.330 --> 00:26:04.333]  And then after the control grid and each phase is in, then they go from denying it to saying, oh yeah, of course we control the weather.
[00:26:04.861 --> 00:26:06.702]  Well, of course we're putting stuff in your water!
[00:26:07.323 --> 00:26:08.984]  What do you think we do it for, silly?
[00:26:11.586 --> 00:26:33.682]  Well, of course, and I'll be on countless radio shows and read quotes about how they want to reduce world population and the talk show host, liberal, conservative, entertainment, comedy, whatever the case is, conservative mainline talk radio, comedy like Opie and Anthony, doesn't matter,
[00:26:35.788 --> 00:26:42.449]  I give them chapter, verse, I give them documents, and they say, well, maybe there are too many people.
[00:26:42.489 --> 00:26:43.289]  That makes sense.
[00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:52.531]  See, in the earlier version of propaganda, they were supposed to deny this was going on, because people hadn't been prepared psychologically yet.
[00:26:52.811 --> 00:27:00.873]  Now that we've reached the phase where they're going into a more hardcore level, it's like, yeah, okay, everybody knows they're killing us, but it's good.
[00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:09.165]  They think it's like received knowledge and special and intellectual that they're into it.
[00:27:11.406 --> 00:27:14.088]  And subconsciously they kind of see it as they're the elitist.
[00:27:14.168 --> 00:27:21.453]  By accepting it and by going along with it, they believe they have power over it.
[00:27:24.595 --> 00:27:25.556]  It's called delusion.
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:33.422]  And different people are still in different phases of the propaganda.
[00:27:34.183 --> 00:27:47.574]  The media simultaneously says there's no move to world government, and it's not going to be run by big international banks, that's insane, while saying, oh my gosh, we just got a new plan to save the global economy, it's a global government run by big private central banks.
[00:27:48.817 --> 00:28:12.897]  So we're gonna have a world government, we're setting it up right now with a Bancor Global cashless currency, and we're phasing out cash, and all of that, and we're gonna have forced inoculations, and we are having your neighbors spy on you, and we are putting in telescreens to watch everyone, but there's no world government, there's no Bancor Global currency, no one's spying on anybody, and it's all insane if you criticize it.
[00:28:15.754 --> 00:28:27.018]  And so people who've been culturally trained by the television and the doublespeak and the brainwashing, it's seen as an attribute to be able to buy into the open, ridiculous, cartoonish-level, absurdist fraud.
[00:28:29.058 --> 00:28:36.781]  And so your neighbor will both laugh at you with a self-assured look when you talk about world government, but then also say, well, we all know that's what we need.
[00:28:39.411 --> 00:28:41.632]  You think it's the world government, but of course there is one, but it's good.
[00:28:42.092 --> 00:28:42.952]  But you're still crazy.
[00:28:43.572 --> 00:28:53.056]  And that's seen as a knowledge to be gullible, to be stupid, to be foolish, to trick yourself, to be into being abused and robbed.
[00:28:53.096 --> 00:29:06.520]  And as long as people have their baubles, their iPhones, their iPads, their computers, their cars, their latest cool clothes, they're happy to sell out their liberty, their freedom, their dignity.
[00:29:08.274 --> 00:29:12.141]  A lot of people fetishize submitting to abuse and tyranny.
[00:29:14.932 --> 00:29:22.873]  I mean, when a cop comes up to me and I'm on a street corner demonstrating and says, I'm going to arrest you if you don't leave, I see it as a full assault on the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:29:23.033 --> 00:29:26.694]  I know if that goes, everything follows and then we'll be in bondage.
[00:29:27.094 --> 00:29:29.415]  I know what it means to private property and family.
[00:29:29.715 --> 00:29:30.575]  I know the danger.
[00:29:31.055 --> 00:29:32.315]  I want to wake the cop up.
[00:29:32.475 --> 00:29:35.496]  I don't want him to be an instrument of my destruction and their destruction.
[00:29:35.996 --> 00:29:37.256]  So I become outraged.
[00:29:37.556 --> 00:29:40.676]  And the yuppie will say on YouTube, oh, just follow authority.
[00:29:40.997 --> 00:29:41.877]  Do what you're told.
[00:29:42.137 --> 00:29:43.097]  Don't be so uppity.
[00:29:44.429 --> 00:29:45.109]  Go along!
[00:29:45.309 --> 00:29:45.950]  Bend over!
[00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:49.011]  We'll be right back to break down the eugenics.
[00:29:49.031 --> 00:29:49.551]  This is key.
[00:29:49.751 --> 00:29:50.672]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.152 --> 00:29:52.753]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.673 --> 00:29:56.474]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.496 --> 00:30:01.777]  Folks, you've heard us talk about Home Gain before.

[00:30:59.383 --> 00:31:01.984]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:31:02.384 --> 00:31:07.345]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:31:07.705 --> 00:31:09.446]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:31:09.766 --> 00:31:14.567]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:31:14.767 --> 00:31:15.728]  How much do you want?
[00:31:15.948 --> 00:31:16.688]  When do you want it?
[00:31:17.068 --> 00:31:18.669]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:31:18.969 --> 00:31:19.789]  When will you need it?
[00:31:20.029 --> 00:31:22.090]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:23.210]  Will there be any food?
[00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:27.475]  Will it make your children sick if there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself?
[00:31:27.635 --> 00:31:30.158]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:31:30.358 --> 00:31:33.541]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:31:33.942 --> 00:31:37.446]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:31:37.766 --> 00:31:38.747]  How much will you need?
[00:31:39.008 --> 00:31:39.608]  We don't know.
[00:31:39.909 --> 00:31:40.810]  How much do you want?
[00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:41.731]  All you can get.
[00:31:41.751 --> 00:31:42.752]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:31:43.012 --> 00:31:45.775]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:31:46.055 --> 00:31:49.179]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:31:49.199 --> 00:31:50.120]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:31:58.416 --> 00:32:01.897]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[00:32:02.257 --> 00:32:06.297]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[00:32:06.518 --> 00:32:11.158]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[00:32:11.178 --> 00:32:16.399]  Not looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[00:32:17.159 --> 00:32:24.321]  Not worried about them moving south, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[00:32:26.986 --> 00:32:31.330]  I'm looking for America.
[00:32:32.471 --> 00:32:33.932]  Wear American and be proud.
[00:32:34.113 --> 00:32:36.555]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[00:32:36.575 --> 00:32:40.899]  The land of the free and the home of the brave.
[00:32:41.339 --> 00:32:45.583]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[00:32:52.927 --> 00:32:57.531]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[00:33:02.235 --> 00:33:08.761]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:08.841 --> 00:33:09.662]  It is one thing
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:27.633]  To read United Nations Biological Diversity Assessments and Club of Rome reports and Rockefeller Foundation reports.
[00:33:28.629 --> 00:33:49.464]  Where they openly come out and say that they were going to train us to not have families, that they were going to break up our industrial society and our agrarian society so that we're dependent on the state, that the government and megacorporations that grow up around it would control every facet of our lives.
[00:33:50.706 --> 00:34:09.171]  And to see the United Nations 50-plus years ago reporting on this, the Rockefeller Foundation almost a hundred years ago pushing this, Edward Bernays promoting it, countless globalists, Aldous Huxley, his brother at the UN, Julian Huxley,
[00:34:11.341 --> 00:34:22.346]  HG Wells, all of them writing non-fiction books, battle planning, this absolute nightmare where this tiny scientific elite would rule over the population.
[00:34:23.247 --> 00:34:28.069]  And this giant control grid, these compact prison cities, are a means to an end.
[00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:30.630]  And they are prisons.
[00:34:32.930 --> 00:34:36.313]  And that's why I have the website PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:34:37.034 --> 00:34:42.599]  They are turning our local communities into prisons, our schools into prisons, the hospitals into prisons.
[00:34:43.199 --> 00:34:46.282]  And now more and more I see citizens in Australia in the headlines.
[00:34:46.582 --> 00:34:47.923]  Hospitals are now prisons.
[00:34:48.304 --> 00:34:49.425]  I see articles in the US.
[00:34:49.465 --> 00:34:50.626]  Schools are now prisons.
[00:34:50.926 --> 00:34:51.447]  They are.
[00:34:52.047 --> 00:34:54.850]  And by increment we're being brought into these prisons.
[00:34:56.127 --> 00:35:00.128]  And we're also being told that this new collectivism is for the Earth.
[00:35:00.288 --> 00:35:03.049]  It has nothing to do with the environment.
[00:35:03.369 --> 00:35:09.251]  The global engineers, when you read their deeper writings, say they're going to remake the Earth.
[00:35:09.551 --> 00:35:10.872]  They could care less about the Earth.
[00:35:11.192 --> 00:35:16.994]  Anything they destroy, they believe through genetic engineering and their seed vaults, they're going to be able to rebuild.
[00:35:17.932 --> 00:35:20.874]  They believe in destroying something to recreate it.
[00:35:20.994 --> 00:35:22.316]  They think they're God.
[00:35:22.596 --> 00:35:23.977]  So understand that.
[00:35:24.517 --> 00:35:26.219]  Now, something else is going on here.
[00:35:26.239 --> 00:35:27.440]  I'm going to go through all of this here.
[00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:29.661]  It may take 30 minutes, it may take an hour.
[00:35:29.922 --> 00:35:31.283]  I'm going to break this down right now.
[00:35:31.783 --> 00:35:39.509]  The prison city, the prison planet, the end of humanity as we know it, irrevocably damaging and breaking the human
[00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:41.130]  Family.
[00:35:41.651 --> 00:35:42.671]  Re-engineering it.
[00:35:42.711 --> 00:35:49.214]  Just like they re-engineer a salmon or they re-engineer a goat to produce spider webs for body armor.
[00:35:49.634 --> 00:35:50.954]  We are being engineered.
[00:35:51.295 --> 00:35:52.875]  Our water is being manipulated.
[00:35:53.075 --> 00:35:55.136]  We're being electromagnetically manipulated.
[00:35:55.236 --> 00:35:56.437]  It's all admitted.
[00:35:56.997 --> 00:36:03.420]  And the biggest message here is the average bureaucrat or cop or enforcer or TSA person.
[00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:06.621]  You are under just as much attack as all of us.
[00:36:06.921 --> 00:36:07.741]  You are on
[00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:13.734]  Our side of the fence, there's only a few thousand top globalists.
[00:36:14.195 --> 00:36:23.505]  Even Rothkopf, the head of the Kissinger Group, admits that in a book he wrote, and he also wrote an article about it for the Washington Post three years ago called Superclass, where he openly admitted
[00:36:25.387 --> 00:36:28.730]  That there are 6,000 global super class rulers.
[00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:35.196]  And of course, he's a mid-level servant, so he would see it from that perspective as one of the 6,000 super gophers.
[00:36:35.717 --> 00:36:40.882]  There's less than 20 super families, only a couple hundred master owners.
[00:36:42.283 --> 00:36:47.148]  And a very few at the top who have total power.
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:50.761]  And that's what these global councils have created.
[00:36:50.981 --> 00:36:56.582]  And it's because the globalists know how to combine forces and work together that they're so dangerous.
[00:36:57.522 --> 00:36:58.282]  They have a goal.
[00:36:58.822 --> 00:36:59.923]  It is immortality.
[00:37:00.143 --> 00:37:01.143]  This is their own statements.
[00:37:01.423 --> 00:37:03.103]  It's covered in my seminal film, Endgame.
[00:37:03.343 --> 00:37:05.004]  Their own statements over and over again.
[00:37:05.324 --> 00:37:10.265]  Planetary government, control grid under environmental rationing,
[00:37:11.533 --> 00:37:18.237]  Then controlled bioweapon plagues release that they have the cure for, the immunity for.
[00:37:19.297 --> 00:37:22.779]  Underground bases that they will re-emerge from after we've been eliminated.
[00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:25.281]  Now, this is going to happen.
[00:37:26.361 --> 00:37:30.324]  I told you gold was going to go from 300 to 1,400 ten years ago.
[00:37:30.424 --> 00:37:30.884]  It has.
[00:37:31.544 --> 00:37:34.726]  I told you they were going to blow up the World Trade Center and blame it on their asset bin Laden.
[00:37:35.586 --> 00:37:36.007]  It happened.
[00:37:37.003 --> 00:37:39.305]  I've told you they're going to announce a World Government World Bank.
[00:37:39.405 --> 00:37:44.308]  I've told you that they would steal trillions in the bailout and then not tell Congress where the money went.
[00:37:44.809 --> 00:37:49.852]  All I do is eat, drink, and sleep and dream and pray this information.
[00:37:50.213 --> 00:37:51.714]  That's all I do.
[00:37:52.394 --> 00:38:00.200]  When I'm holding my littlest daughter in my arms, my smallest daughter, I'm trying to think about her and love her and I do, but I am somewhere else.
[00:38:01.664 --> 00:38:02.804]  Okay?
[00:38:03.145 --> 00:38:05.626]  This is 100% happening.
[00:38:05.646 --> 00:38:06.086]  You understand?
[00:38:06.326 --> 00:38:07.786]  You are being murdered.
[00:38:08.066 --> 00:38:09.507]  You are being killed.
[00:38:09.807 --> 00:38:11.408]  You are being brain damaged.
[00:38:11.428 --> 00:38:14.489]  Your potential is being bent and stunted now.
[00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:17.561]  Let me start getting into this information.
[00:38:17.941 --> 00:38:19.682]  Here is Paul Watson's latest article.
[00:38:20.002 --> 00:38:22.823]  Two articles today by the one and only Paul Watson.
[00:38:23.123 --> 00:38:26.065]  Plandopolis elitist agenda for eco-enslavement.
[00:38:26.465 --> 00:38:30.907]  I called him, we had a 30 minute consultation this morning, and I said your article isn't hardcore enough.
[00:38:31.608 --> 00:38:33.148]  It doesn't give them the full magnitude.
[00:38:33.549 --> 00:38:34.769]  I want this article.
[00:38:35.089 --> 00:38:37.010]  Eco-fascist call for prison cities.
[00:38:37.471 --> 00:38:37.871]  He did it.
[00:38:42.418 --> 00:38:47.482]  These people are absolute control freak, murdering filth.
[00:38:49.284 --> 00:38:50.885]  And I wrote these notes I wanted to cover.
[00:38:51.185 --> 00:38:53.927]  First, there's an attempt to rebrand Dystopia.
[00:38:54.548 --> 00:38:57.870]  They're lovingly taking their time destroying the human species.
[00:38:58.471 --> 00:39:00.573]  Irrevocably wrecking humanity.
[00:39:00.953 --> 00:39:03.595]  The prison school, city, state, nation, planet.
[00:39:03.855 --> 00:39:04.876]  The end of the family.
[00:39:05.757 --> 00:39:10.541]  Now, what got me so upset this morning is their brazen nakedness.
[00:39:12.093 --> 00:39:27.904]  There is an organization in England, funded by the government, that partners with the Guardian, just as the Guardian and others partnered with the 1010 group that produced the movie theater ads and TV ads, where the teacher says, okay, we're gonna play it again later, okay.
[00:39:29.368 --> 00:39:30.830]  Will you cut your carbon footprint?
[00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:36.175]  Most of the kids say yes, a few say no, and they blow up a bunch of ten-year-olds.
[00:39:36.275 --> 00:39:37.176]  Little girls, little boys.
[00:39:37.476 --> 00:39:38.597]  Guts and blood fly everywhere.
[00:39:38.818 --> 00:39:43.122]  Then it shows the same thing at a business office, at a football club, the whole thing.
[00:39:45.302 --> 00:39:50.705]  They know that once you don't have bedrock morals that are your own, that's why they attack anything old.
[00:39:50.725 --> 00:39:58.190]  It may not be perfect, the way the Christian faith manifests, or the Muslim faith, or the Judaic faith, or the Buddhist faith.
[00:39:58.210 --> 00:39:59.191]  It doesn't matter.
[00:39:59.231 --> 00:40:04.254]  They attack it because it's old, and it's guaranteed to have a lot more common sense than what they're doing.
[00:40:05.134 --> 00:40:06.294]  Like the family's good.
[00:40:06.594 --> 00:40:07.615]  Independence is good.
[00:40:08.175 --> 00:40:10.075]  Spying and tattling on neighbors is bad.
[00:40:10.615 --> 00:40:12.416]  Governments that wear black uniforms are bad.
[00:40:12.436 --> 00:40:13.956]  Just archetypal understandings.
[00:40:14.436 --> 00:40:20.478]  They are taking in archetypal wickedness and saying, Luke Skywalker bad, Darth Vader good.
[00:40:21.578 --> 00:40:23.378]  They're throwing extreme things out.
[00:40:23.619 --> 00:40:25.999]  Torturing children in front of their parents, good.
[00:40:26.279 --> 00:40:27.500]  That's what the new hero does.
[00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:29.120]  Murdering children, good.
[00:40:30.563 --> 00:40:37.086]  And they're interplaying it where they can say, this foreign group is bad when they do it, but our government's good when they do it.
[00:40:38.987 --> 00:40:48.572]  And all the nature shows and the programs and the brainwashing in public and private schools, all of them, teach humans are bad, humans are evil.
[00:40:48.772 --> 00:40:52.394]  And then they get you to do something reasonable at first, a low flush toilet.
[00:40:54.375 --> 00:40:56.676]  No lead paint, catalytic converters.
[00:40:57.436 --> 00:40:59.237]  Then it's, don't take a hot bath.
[00:41:01.189 --> 00:41:02.770]  Then it's don't have more than one child.
[00:41:02.830 --> 00:41:20.020]  Then it's spy on your parents for environmental crimes that aren't even crimes yet, but have them write fake tickets on Mommy and Daddy and write dossiers on Mommy and Daddy and then have news articles everywhere where parents are in the news approving of their children, instructing them and tattling on them with government orders.
[00:41:20.741 --> 00:41:23.682]  Just absolute 110% creme de la creme, ultimate
[00:41:27.185 --> 00:41:27.565]  Tyranny.
[00:41:28.266 --> 00:41:29.807]  The greatest expression of tyranny.
[00:41:30.048 --> 00:41:32.750]  Children openly turned against their parents by the state.
[00:41:38.195 --> 00:41:41.938]  And so they're just practicing all of this right out in front of all of us.
[00:41:41.998 --> 00:41:43.319]  And I've mentioned this years ago.
[00:41:43.379 --> 00:41:45.041]  I've mentioned it previously.
[00:41:45.081 --> 00:41:45.941]  And it's so important.
[00:41:46.302 --> 00:41:47.623]  It's the Overton window.
[00:41:47.723 --> 00:41:50.886]  And there's other psychological schools of thought that say the same thing.
[00:41:52.096 --> 00:41:53.417]  The Communists talked about this.
[00:41:53.477 --> 00:41:56.598]  Lenin talked about freezing and unfreezing society.
[00:41:56.918 --> 00:41:58.359]  Create enough crisis, enough fear.
[00:41:58.939 --> 00:42:00.479]  Unfreeze the status quo.
[00:42:00.739 --> 00:42:06.302]  When it's liquefied, they can remold it like wet clay in the image they want, and then freeze it again.
[00:42:06.802 --> 00:42:10.543]  We are in an unfrozen mode right now as they bring in the tyranny.
[00:42:12.324 --> 00:42:14.885]  But in that open window, we can strike back.
[00:42:15.385 --> 00:42:15.906]  And we are.
[00:42:17.646 --> 00:42:19.427]  Now, another way to see it is the Overton window.
[00:42:21.445 --> 00:42:33.431]  The Overton Window is a political theory described as a window in a range of public reactions to ideas and public discourse in a spectrum of all possible opinions on a particular issue.
[00:42:33.451 --> 00:42:38.814]  It is named after its originator, Joseph P. Overton, former vice president of the
[00:42:40.017 --> 00:42:42.399]  Mechanic Center for Public Policy, and it goes on...
[00:42:58.451 --> 00:43:06.855]  Office, Overton arranged the spectrum on a vertical axis of more free or less free in regards to government intervention.
[00:43:07.216 --> 00:43:12.718]  When the window moves or expands, ideas or accordingly become more or less politically acceptable.
[00:43:13.819 --> 00:43:21.123]  The degrees of acceptance of public ideas can be described roughly unthinkable, radical, acceptable, sensible, popular policy.
[00:43:22.043 --> 00:43:22.604]  Well, now
[00:43:23.783 --> 00:43:35.259]  They've taught children in school not to have opinions, not to judge cultures like Aztecs bad, Nazis bad, Communists bad, Renaissance good.
[00:43:37.967 --> 00:43:39.087]  So people can't judge.
[00:43:39.107 --> 00:44:02.133]  Then they come in, though, and say, but you've got to follow our moral dictates, save the Earth, you're bad, kill yourself, death education, the world without humans, the planet after humans, all these TV shows, all these movies, apocalyptic doom coming, everyone dead, getting you ready so that you accept it as everyone's dying around you from the bioweapon they will release.
[00:44:02.953 --> 00:44:04.493]  I believe bioweapons the way they're going to go.
[00:44:05.314 --> 00:44:06.594]  They'll be beta test ahead of it.
[00:44:08.772 --> 00:44:15.250]  At least a lot of you servants of evil, when you're being killed by this, if we don't turn this around, at least when it's happening, finally you'll wake up and get right with God.
[00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:16.694]  And that's what matters at the end of it.
[00:44:17.884 --> 00:44:19.545]  And some people will survive and dig in.
[00:44:19.766 --> 00:44:23.849]  And then you'll fully know when the government's flying around on its drones saying, come out, come out.
[00:44:24.089 --> 00:44:24.970]  We want to help you.
[00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:25.830]  The plague is over.
[00:44:26.051 --> 00:44:27.031]  You'll know that's the enemy.
[00:44:27.051 --> 00:44:29.373]  A lot of you'll still come out, though, even when that happens.
[00:44:29.413 --> 00:44:30.114]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:44:30.134 --> 00:44:33.156]  You'll be watching this transmission later, and I'm speaking to you in the future.
[00:44:33.336 --> 00:44:34.057]  And that's what matters.
[00:44:34.077 --> 00:44:36.919]  We can beat these people, even if they were able to carry it this far.
[00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:38.381]  Now you know.
[00:44:38.721 --> 00:44:40.162]  Now you know how real it is.
[00:44:42.904 --> 00:44:43.805]  All right, continuing.
[00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:52.363]  So what they're doing is, they're just out in the open saying, we'll murder your children.
[00:44:52.843 --> 00:44:54.504]  They have green police ads for Audi.
[00:44:55.025 --> 00:45:01.189]  And then the ad agency in San Francisco, months after I told you this, came out and said, this is what we really want.
[00:45:01.449 --> 00:45:05.372]  We're using this as a social message that you will be arrested for the wrong light bulbs.
[00:45:05.832 --> 00:45:08.774]  San Francisco Chronicle.
[00:45:08.834 --> 00:45:12.157]  I played that ad of green police and I said, this is what they're going to do.
[00:45:12.497 --> 00:45:13.978]  This is their real plan.
[00:45:14.298 --> 00:45:15.519]  This is their program.
[00:45:20.856 --> 00:45:31.829]  Now they're putting out all these TV ads and videos promoting horrible, horrible dystopic futures, where if you don't accept a police state control grid, you're gonna be put in a ghetto.
[00:45:33.370 --> 00:45:34.892]  You don't accept a microchip under your skin?
[00:45:35.092 --> 00:45:36.394]  That's what all the transhumanists say.
[00:45:36.414 --> 00:45:37.255]  That's what the government says.
[00:45:37.615 --> 00:45:40.639]  Oh, you don't have to have the brain chip, you just won't be able to get a job anywhere.
[00:45:44.605 --> 00:45:57.805]  And they lay out how wonderful it is that you only get meat on your birthday, that you gotta have a travel pass, that everywhere you go is tracked, and they say it with a straight face how great it is, knowing they're moving the Overton window into the Bizarro!
[00:46:01.613 --> 00:46:11.297]  So that they pull you so far away that just having a smart meter controlling the temperature of your house sounds reasonable compared to what they're proposing, murdering school children if they don't submit.
[00:46:12.078 --> 00:46:15.879]  Now it doesn't sound so extreme to say, hey, we just want a smart meter in your house.
[00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:21.962]  That sounded extreme ten years ago when I told you about it and people laughed, even when I had the government reports on it.
[00:46:22.202 --> 00:46:24.343]  Now, they're going in everywhere and it's just accepted.
[00:46:24.363 --> 00:46:30.446]  I mean, this is diabolical psychological warfare.
[00:46:31.906 --> 00:46:36.248]  What they don't tell you is once you're in the compact cities, those will be the final kill grids.
[00:46:37.268 --> 00:46:46.572]  And they're going to have the compact cities, not just in the name of the environment, but when they wipe out with genetically designed, race-specific weapons.
[00:46:46.832 --> 00:46:51.314]  When people see tens of millions dying, those will just be the beta test.
[00:46:51.614 --> 00:46:53.355]  People will run into the compact cities.
[00:46:53.735 --> 00:46:56.536]  Kind of a 12 monkeys scenario where we're all going into this.
[00:46:56.556 --> 00:46:57.756]  See, they're going to hit us from that.
[00:46:57.836 --> 00:47:00.998]  Security, bioweapon security, environmental.
[00:47:01.758 --> 00:47:09.124]  When you read the SPP you learn a lot and you see it mirrored in all their other programs how they say every crisis the answer will be North American merger.
[00:47:09.765 --> 00:47:12.868]  See, every crisis the answer will be high-tech surveillance cities.
[00:47:14.815 --> 00:47:33.041]  And it's all being announced, the big rollouts, the control grids, the face scanning cameras, multi-billion dollar in Texas and San Antonio and outside Salt Lake and Utah, giant spy centers, cyber security, total control, high school recruiting of all the young hackers, armies of them to shut down free speech.
[00:47:33.182 --> 00:47:37.023]  I mean, they're moving in full mechanization against free humanity right now.
[00:47:38.663 --> 00:47:47.789]  They're going to increase the degenerative bio and chemical weapons and radiological and also the electromagnetic weapons systems they're pumping in against us.
[00:47:48.089 --> 00:47:49.790]  That's all going to now start increasing.
[00:47:50.490 --> 00:47:53.252]  Your neighbors dying to your left, your right, you dying.
[00:47:53.552 --> 00:48:03.478]  It's just going to get worse and worse and then saying everything's fine and the yuppies giggling and you know local jogging groups to raise money you know because everybody's dying we got to find the cure to it.
[00:48:03.658 --> 00:48:08.381]  That'll be put into bioweapons funding to actually make more bioweapons for you and your family.
[00:48:08.861 --> 00:48:16.831]  All the major groups fighting the diabetes, the cancer, the heart disease, all actually funding and running operations on how to carry it out.
[00:48:17.091 --> 00:48:18.252]  Full spectrum dominance.
[00:48:18.333 --> 00:48:19.013]  Full death.
[00:48:19.073 --> 00:48:19.874]  Full massacre.
[00:48:20.646 --> 00:48:22.007]  This is the giant plan.
[00:48:22.547 --> 00:48:28.712]  We're going to go to break here in a moment, but I want to go ahead and play, from endgame, just the first few minutes of the film.
[00:48:29.452 --> 00:48:40.219]  After the three minute intro, the first few minutes where I lay out the prison planet control grid, and then I'm going to play, produced with government money out of England, what they're showing school kids about the future.
[00:48:40.439 --> 00:48:43.622]  It's exactly what I say, but saying it's good.
[00:48:46.721 --> 00:48:47.341]  How did I know this?
[00:48:47.361 --> 00:48:48.722]  Because it was their written plan.
[00:48:49.042 --> 00:48:50.663]  But to see it manifesting.
[00:48:51.003 --> 00:48:51.363]  Here it is.
[00:48:51.403 --> 00:48:52.744]  Let's play part of Endgame.
[00:48:56.026 --> 00:48:58.727]  Your New World Order will fall.
[00:48:59.107 --> 00:49:01.328]  Humanity will defeat you.
[00:49:01.689 --> 00:49:02.669]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:49:25.447 --> 00:49:31.171]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:49:31.191 --> 00:49:31.892]  This is from 2007.
[00:49:32.352 --> 00:49:35.475]  Once free nations are slaves to the will of a tiny elite.
[00:49:36.775 --> 00:49:39.538]  The dawn of a new dark age is upon mankind.
[00:49:41.159 --> 00:49:42.740]  Countries are a thing of the past.
[00:49:43.821 --> 00:49:50.926]  Every form of independence is under attack, with the family and even the individual itself nearing extinction.
[00:49:52.759 --> 00:49:56.202]  Close to 80% of the Earth's population has been eliminated.
[00:49:57.804 --> 00:50:04.730]  The remnants of a once free humanity are forced to live within highly controlled, compact, prison-like cities.
[00:50:06.451 --> 00:50:08.073]  Travel is highly restricted.
[00:50:09.234 --> 00:50:15.199]  Superhighways connect the megacities and keep the population from entering into unauthorized zones.
[00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:18.121]  No human activity is private.
[00:50:19.332 --> 00:50:23.614]  AI supercomputers chronicle and categorize every action.
[00:50:23.814 --> 00:50:27.975]  A prison planet dominated by a ruthless gang of control freaks... Alright!
[00:50:28.235 --> 00:50:33.457]  ...whose power... We're gonna go to break, and then we're gonna come back and play a minute or so more.
[00:50:34.137 --> 00:50:35.418]  Now you watch the news.
[00:50:35.438 --> 00:50:36.798]  This was extreme a few years ago.
[00:50:36.818 --> 00:50:38.219]  Now it's smart...
[00:50:39.079 --> 00:50:47.769]  Computers and cameras to make sure you wash your hands, to make sure doctors do a good job, to watch your children, to watch parents, to make sure you're good.
[00:50:48.089 --> 00:50:49.631]  Everyone's guilty until proven innocent.
[00:50:49.831 --> 00:50:51.133]  The NSA runs it all.
[00:50:51.153 --> 00:50:52.995]  1984 is good.
[00:50:53.275 --> 00:50:54.717]  Killing children is good.
[00:50:55.598 --> 00:50:55.858]  See?
[00:50:56.539 --> 00:50:57.300]  I mean, it's here.
[00:50:57.580 --> 00:50:59.643]  And we're gonna play their video coming up.
[00:50:59.983 --> 00:51:04.446]  We all know that Berkey Water Purification Systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:51:45.711 --> 00:51:45.932]  Or order
[00:52:00.561 --> 00:52:04.184]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:52:04.584 --> 00:52:07.586]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:52:07.826 --> 00:52:12.609]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:52:12.629 --> 00:52:18.853]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:19.013 --> 00:52:21.275]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:52:21.795 --> 00:52:22.075]  Tim Geithner?
[00:52:22.095 --> 00:52:22.535]  Bernanke?
[00:52:22.615 --> 00:52:23.375]  They're arsonists!
[00:52:23.415 --> 00:52:24.536]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:24.556 --> 00:52:26.796]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:42.541]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:42.841 --> 00:52:47.623]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:52:47.983 --> 00:52:57.066]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:02.582]  Forget everything you've been told about long-term food storage.
[00:53:02.803 --> 00:53:10.048]  When all hell breaks loose, you'll need the single most effective way to get high-powered Delta Force nutrients to your family, fast.
[00:53:10.788 --> 00:53:13.530]  Like any Special Forces commando, you need a plan.
[00:53:13.891 --> 00:53:16.152]  You need a Black Hawk Down food plan.
[00:53:16.433 --> 00:53:19.555]  Introducing the Survival Sprout Bank from Solutions from Science.
[00:53:19.835 --> 00:53:21.597]  It's your countertop survival garden.
[00:53:21.877 --> 00:53:26.120]  Yes, grow fresh greens right on your countertop in just a few short days.
[00:53:26.441 --> 00:53:33.286]  Sprouts are the green shoots that emerge from newly germinated seeds, and they are powerhouses of living, easily absorbed nutrients.
[00:53:33.507 --> 00:53:36.909]  The Survival Sprout Bank is a complete kit with nothing else to buy.
[00:53:37.130 --> 00:53:41.413]  And with sprouts so easy to grow, even children can grow emergency food.

[00:53:42.954 --> 00:53:43.195]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:53:48.439 --> 00:53:51.661]  It's a gang of control freaks, whose power can never be challenged.
[00:53:51.681 --> 00:53:53.922]  This is the vision of the global elite, their goal.
[00:54:15.663 --> 00:54:19.887]  A program of total dehumanization where the science of tyranny is law.
[00:54:21.189 --> 00:54:26.734]  A worldwide control grid designed to ensure the Overlord's monopoly of power forever.
[00:54:27.775 --> 00:54:36.224]  Our species will be condemned to this nightmare future unless the masses are awakened to the New World Order master plan and mobilized to defeat it.
[00:54:38.729 --> 00:54:50.660]  Erected by a secretive group, the Georgia Guidestones are a testament to the elite's plan for a world religion, global laws, with a global court and army to enforce it.
[00:54:53.162 --> 00:54:57.586]  And set in stone, it is written that the population never rise above 500 million.
[00:55:05.023 --> 00:55:08.324]  In this film, you will learn how our world is truly governed.
[00:55:09.184 --> 00:55:14.706]  You will see how highly secretive roundtable groups interlock to form a global intelligence network.
[00:55:15.467 --> 00:55:19.128]  This group has been steering planetary affairs for hundreds of years.
[00:55:19.988 --> 00:55:23.549]  Now, in the final stage, they prepare for open world government.
[00:55:25.310 --> 00:55:27.991]  A goal tyrants throughout history have lusted after.
[00:55:30.242 --> 00:55:35.564]  Dr. Michael Kaufman is a published ecologist specializing in... Alright, and then we get into the main part of the film.
[00:55:35.644 --> 00:55:56.690]  Now, you heard me just play from the intro of the documentary, then we get into more chapters going through every facet of it, with all the proof, their statements, their video clips, how they're going to set up the grid, how they're going to cut off our resources, always promising to fix things, we give them more power, always getting more of a stranglehold around us, and then killing us!
[00:55:58.127 --> 00:56:03.732]  And the average yuppie who finally accepts this automatically says, well then I'll be part of the elite.
[00:56:04.152 --> 00:56:05.573]  No, you won't.
[00:56:06.514 --> 00:56:07.615]  Get that through your head.
[00:56:07.755 --> 00:56:09.897]  It's very sick that you go along with this.
[00:56:10.317 --> 00:56:15.701]  But I guess you were taught in college that it's cool to be into killing people and that there's too many people and you have a disdain for folks.
[00:56:16.642 --> 00:56:18.784]  So, you're getting what you deserve.
[00:56:18.824 --> 00:56:19.985]  But I don't deserve it.
[00:56:20.285 --> 00:56:21.186]  My family doesn't.
[00:56:21.446 --> 00:56:24.869]  And free humanity and people that have got a soul out there don't deserve it.
[00:56:25.069 --> 00:56:26.050]  And we stand against you.
[00:56:26.758 --> 00:56:30.061]  Now, we're going to go to break here in a few minutes, but I'm going to go ahead and start playing this clip.
[00:56:31.762 --> 00:56:34.784]  And again, this is airing over in England.
[00:56:34.804 --> 00:56:36.426]  This is promoted with government funding.
[00:56:36.766 --> 00:56:38.227]  The London Guardian's involved.
[00:56:38.908 --> 00:56:43.591]  The planned opulence, elitist agenda for eco-fascist enslavement.
[00:56:44.792 --> 00:56:52.538]  And I'll start playing part of it now, come back and play the rest of it, but it's so amazing how they just calmly
[00:56:53.908 --> 00:57:02.380]  Describe total surveillance, total tyranny, food rationing, government authorization to even travel to work every day.
[00:57:02.721 --> 00:57:04.103]  But it's not tyranny.
[00:57:04.884 --> 00:57:06.306]  It's done to save the Earth.
[00:57:07.908 --> 00:57:09.671]  What came out all over the news the last week?
[00:57:10.954 --> 00:57:11.574]  And it's confirmed.
[00:57:11.594 --> 00:57:13.194]  The German government admits it's true.
[00:57:13.755 --> 00:57:16.255]  They claimed that it was for the environment.
[00:57:16.635 --> 00:57:20.076]  All these spy satellites they were launching, these infrared spy satellites.
[00:57:20.576 --> 00:57:21.976]  Oh, the billions of dollars.
[00:57:22.536 --> 00:57:26.397]  It wasn't to spy on you in England and the United States and Europe.
[00:57:27.437 --> 00:57:30.378]  No, in the U.S.-German BND partnership.
[00:57:31.218 --> 00:57:34.918]  No, it was to check for greenhouse gases.
[00:57:35.498 --> 00:57:38.139]  Turns out, it's body scanning from orbit.
[00:57:39.295 --> 00:57:40.496]  This is their cover!
[00:57:41.137 --> 00:57:43.539]  It has nothing to do with the earth.
[00:57:43.859 --> 00:57:45.621]  What Bill Gates said on TED TV last year.
[00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:49.682]  He said we've got to lower the human population to lower the carbon footprint.
[00:57:50.202 --> 00:57:52.163]  Humans exhale carbon dioxide.
[00:57:52.364 --> 00:57:53.464]  It's part of the life cycle.
[00:57:53.945 --> 00:57:56.847]  Then plants, they release oxygen.
[00:57:57.347 --> 00:58:04.312]  They respirate and operate and engage in photosynthesis from carbon dioxide that animal life puts off.
[00:58:04.772 --> 00:58:07.394]  Then they release oxygen that animal life lives on.
[00:58:07.794 --> 00:58:09.995]  Symbiotic carbon cycle.
[00:58:10.115 --> 00:58:13.157]  Water, oxygen, carbon dioxide, sunlight.
[00:58:13.638 --> 00:58:14.338]  Four things.
[00:58:14.839 --> 00:58:15.999]  Four things!
[00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:19.761]  And they've got the public convinced and ready to salute!
[00:58:20.501 --> 00:58:21.822]  Going after carbon dioxide.
[00:58:21.962 --> 00:58:24.583]  You want to genetically engineer cross-species spider goats?
[00:58:25.483 --> 00:58:25.943]  Salmon?
[00:58:27.284 --> 00:58:27.824]  Everything?
[00:58:28.024 --> 00:58:28.544]  Deadly?
[00:58:28.604 --> 00:58:29.644]  Just hurting the earth?
[00:58:29.944 --> 00:58:30.485]  Go for it!
[00:58:31.085 --> 00:58:31.865]  You want to breathe?
[00:58:32.525 --> 00:58:32.745]  No!
[00:58:33.686 --> 00:58:36.947]  We're gonna come back, play the clip, stay with us.
[00:58:44.059 --> 00:58:48.324]  On Demand, we are the GCN Radio Network.
[00:58:49.124 --> 00:58:53.367]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:58:53.687 --> 00:58:54.287]  Number one.
[00:58:54.587 --> 00:58:57.749]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:58.010 --> 00:58:58.590]  Number two.
[00:58:58.890 --> 00:59:03.433]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:03.773 --> 00:59:04.214]  It's true.
[00:59:04.514 --> 00:59:09.077]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:09.377 --> 00:59:09.937]  Number three.
[00:59:10.217 --> 00:59:13.499]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:17.502]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:59:17.702 --> 00:59:18.243]  Number 4.
[00:59:18.503 --> 00:59:20.866]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:59:21.246 --> 00:59:24.650]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:59:24.930 --> 00:59:25.150]  Number 5.
[00:59:25.731 --> 00:59:29.655]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:59:29.876 --> 00:59:34.641]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:59:34.921 --> 00:59:38.945]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:39.085 --> 00:59:40.667]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:40.887 --> 00:59:42.969]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:59:43.129 --> 00:59:45.712]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:59:45.732 --> 00:59:47.093]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:47.113 --> 00:59:53.119]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:04.008 --> 01:00:08.212]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:08.833 --> 01:00:09.654]  You want answers?
[01:00:10.415 --> 01:00:11.396]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:11.976 --> 01:00:15.560]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:20.224]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.696 --> 01:00:22.216]  We're back.
[01:00:22.437 --> 01:00:25.719]  Most of our affiliates carry the first five-minute segment, but some don't.
[01:00:25.779 --> 01:00:34.864]  So I'm going to launch back into this newest video and get into these incredible articles by Paul Joseph Watson in the next segment that's about seven minutes away.
[01:00:34.884 --> 01:00:39.967]  Let me just tell you about some of the other information coming up.
[01:00:39.987 --> 01:00:44.490]  In one hour from now, Alan Watt will join us for an hour.
[01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:49.813]  Then appears Carbon Meteorologist, who actually understands how the weather works.
[01:00:51.192 --> 01:01:17.081]  Dealing with solar and moon interactions, dealing with the solar winds, which the ancients knew now in the last 20 years, has been proven that what's driving the cloud formations is not potash and volcanoes, but is all of the massive ionizing radiation, particles, micrometeorites, by the ton that are coming into the atmosphere every day.
[01:01:20.558 --> 01:01:26.840]  Yeah, we're a big spaceship, folks, hurtling through the edge of the Milky Way galaxy.
[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:35.103]  We're out here in the boondocks orbiting a little sun, and we're moving mighty fast orbiting that sun, and space is not a void.
[01:01:35.123 --> 01:01:36.564]  It is filled with energy.
[01:01:37.544 --> 01:01:42.126]  It is filled with the quantum vacuum, with the ether.
[01:01:44.483 --> 01:01:52.006]  And just in our dimension there are just so many gamma rays and x-rays and particles and it's just full spectrum.
[01:01:53.006 --> 01:01:56.627]  And of course now the mathematical equations of Einstein and others have been proven to correct.
[01:01:58.068 --> 01:02:07.051]  Many physicists predicted there would be a hexagon in the ice cap of the gas giant Saturn and after the different
[01:02:08.271 --> 01:02:09.672]  Was it Voyager and others went over?
[01:02:10.313 --> 01:02:29.327]  They did photograph that hexagon, which is a dimensional expression on the surface of the gas giant that mathematics showed would be there in a gas giant of that size, an expression of a dimension beneath the surface, or a space
[01:02:31.618 --> 01:02:33.840]  Wormhole distortion of a type.
[01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:35.021]  I don't claim to be a physicist.
[01:02:35.081 --> 01:02:41.746]  I just read the major bodies of the work and then regurgitate it as a lay creature here on air, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:02:41.786 --> 01:02:57.718]  But I study the mass psychology of tyrants, the psychopathic elites that always take control, the scum rising to the top after good rises to the top, milk and honey flows, then we become fat, dumb, and happy, then the evil takes over.
[01:03:00.646 --> 01:03:04.993]  Of course, action alert, now the FDA is going after vitamin C. That's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:03:05.414 --> 01:03:07.497]  Utah welcomes NSA MegaSnoop Center.
[01:03:07.557 --> 01:03:09.481]  PrisonPlanet.com, Infowars.com.
[01:03:10.623 --> 01:03:14.029]  Plandopolis elitist agenda for eco-enslavement.
[01:03:15.316 --> 01:03:18.779]  PrisonPlanet.com, eco-fascist call for prison cities.
[01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:28.649]  I know Matt Drudge listens to the show, and Matt Drudge in the last five years has taken a clear course into liberty and fighting the globalists and covering the Bilderberg Group and covering everything else.
[01:03:28.709 --> 01:03:30.270]  And Matt Drudge gave us a Christmas present.
[01:03:30.751 --> 01:03:35.175]  The only red links out of green links on Christmas Day were AlexJones and InfoWars.com.
[01:03:36.736 --> 01:03:47.599]  I don't look a gift horse in the mouth when somebody gives me so much, and humanity so much, in really turning towards liberty, towards the Polestar, the North Star.
[01:03:49.139 --> 01:03:57.441]  I don't like to ask for more, but if Drudge is listening, I'd really like it if you'd link to eco-fascist call for prison cities.
[01:03:58.201 --> 01:04:01.842]  You know, I burn with desire to expose these people, and I know you do as well.
[01:04:03.431 --> 01:04:05.693]  And it'd be nice if Drudge linked to that.
[01:04:05.934 --> 01:04:08.316]  And if you do, I won't start asking every day.
[01:04:08.796 --> 01:04:14.202]  I have asked before that Drudge move a link to the top to see if he was listening, and he did within minutes.
[01:04:14.662 --> 01:04:17.585]  I don't know if Drudge is listening today, but Matt Drudge, we appreciate you.
[01:04:18.005 --> 01:04:19.086]  Matt Drudge is a smart guy.
[01:04:19.126 --> 01:04:21.989]  He realizes none of us have any future if we don't beat these people.
[01:04:23.831 --> 01:04:24.892]  And the truth is what matters.
[01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:32.381]  Drudge isn't perfect, none of us are, but he is moving in the right direction in a big way.
[01:04:32.921 --> 01:04:36.703]  And forcing Glenn Beck and many others and Walsh Limbaugh to go in the right direction.
[01:04:37.063 --> 01:04:38.643]  He truly is setting more and more of the agenda.
[01:04:39.124 --> 01:04:44.385]  I'd like to see EcoFashion's call for prison settings to be on the all-powerful Drudge Report.
[01:04:45.146 --> 01:04:51.468]  All-powerful, that is, an alternative media cyberspace projection of information breaking through the electronic Berlin Wall of a globalist.
[01:04:52.348 --> 01:04:53.808]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:53.828 --> 01:04:55.569]  It is a dangerous game, though, the drug is playing.
[01:04:55.969 --> 01:04:57.169]  I understand that, and he knows that.
[01:04:57.549 --> 01:04:58.710]  We're all playing a dangerous game.
[01:05:00.130 --> 01:05:14.594]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:05:15.594 --> 01:05:19.275]  My name is Mario Cifaldi, and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:20.290 --> 01:05:32.300]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:05:33.061 --> 01:05:40.326]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:05:41.007 --> 01:05:50.611]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[01:05:51.371 --> 01:05:54.632]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[01:05:55.313 --> 01:05:58.414]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:05:59.042 --> 01:06:03.003]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:06:03.243 --> 01:06:09.284]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:06:09.644 --> 01:06:16.746]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:06:17.026 --> 01:06:21.607]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[01:06:24.648 --> 01:06:27.031]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:06:41.568 --> 01:06:45.013]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:06:45.494 --> 01:06:52.824]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[01:06:52.924 --> 01:06:53.385]  Thank you!
[01:06:58.872 --> 01:07:00.014]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:07:00.054 --> 01:07:06.721]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:07:06.981 --> 01:07:09.264]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:07:09.544 --> 01:07:14.730]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:07:14.930 --> 01:07:17.713]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:07:17.974 --> 01:07:20.036]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:07:20.276 --> 01:07:26.201]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:07:26.521 --> 01:07:29.724]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:07:29.884 --> 01:07:35.429]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:07:35.689 --> 01:07:36.990]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:07:37.311 --> 01:07:38.532]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:07:38.632 --> 01:07:41.174]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:07:41.294 --> 01:07:45.358]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:07:45.518 --> 01:07:47.559]  You can find the video at www.
[01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:54.963]  Alright, so we've seen the TV ads where children don't submit to carbon taxing so the teacher murders them by detonating explosives.
[01:08:17.298 --> 01:08:27.666]  We have seen the promotion by Prince Philip and Ted Turner and others that we should have a one-child policy, official UN policy, China is the model, forced abortion.
[01:08:29.753 --> 01:08:36.081]  We're useless eaters, feeders, all of this Nazi eugenic nomenclature being openly used.
[01:08:36.121 --> 01:08:45.833]  But the West, the United States and England, that part of the West, the Anglo-American arm, did not get these ideas from Herr Goering, Herr Hitler, Herr Goebbels.
[01:08:46.194 --> 01:08:48.256]  They got it from the British!
[01:08:49.827 --> 01:08:51.209]  Not bashing the British people.
[01:08:51.309 --> 01:08:53.792]  I myself am Jones, as Welsh as it comes.
[01:08:54.773 --> 01:09:02.061]  That system was developed in England, germinated, exploded, chestated in the United States.
[01:09:02.601 --> 01:09:03.583]  Mexico loved it.
[01:09:04.784 --> 01:09:06.446]  I mean, all these countries bought into it.
[01:09:06.746 --> 01:09:07.907]  That's the death panels.
[01:09:07.947 --> 01:09:09.029]  That's the euthanasia.
[01:09:11.035 --> 01:09:13.036]  That's the brainwashing that's going on.
[01:09:13.436 --> 01:09:20.638]  So, at the end of the last hour, I played the first few minutes from Endgame, where I said, prison cities, rationing, the end of the family.
[01:09:21.518 --> 01:09:23.479]  You'll have to have travel passes to go to work.
[01:09:24.099 --> 01:09:24.819]  How did I know that?
[01:09:24.940 --> 01:09:27.040]  That's the official Club of Rome UN.
[01:09:27.620 --> 01:09:30.961]  And the film Endgame, over two hours long, breaks it all down.
[01:09:31.222 --> 01:09:32.682]  It's free on YouTube and Google.
[01:09:33.242 --> 01:09:34.503]  Higher quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:09:36.365 --> 01:09:43.288]  I'm not making expensive films here and traveling all over the world and getting arrested and detained to play a game here, folks.
[01:09:44.789 --> 01:09:45.569]  This is real.
[01:09:46.170 --> 01:09:57.155]  Now, I get up this morning at about 6 a.m., I waddle into the computer, wake up, start drinking coffee, and I see Watson's article.
[01:09:59.287 --> 01:10:04.710]  And instantly I knew it was the government-funded group connected to 1010, hooked in with the London Guardian.
[01:10:04.770 --> 01:10:05.510]  I go to their site.
[01:10:05.550 --> 01:10:06.931]  There's the Guardian, the sponsor.
[01:10:08.212 --> 01:10:09.913]  There's the British government.
[01:10:10.913 --> 01:10:12.154]  There it all is, funding it.
[01:10:13.035 --> 01:10:14.235]  And you think it's a joke.
[01:10:14.315 --> 01:10:17.277]  Someone who hasn't been brainwashed, you watch it and you think it's a joke.
[01:10:17.657 --> 01:10:19.618]  Just like the blowing up of the kids if they don't submit.
[01:10:19.898 --> 01:10:20.519]  It's not a joke.
[01:10:21.139 --> 01:10:28.403]  Again, they're conditioning us and rebranding tyranny, rebranding mass murder as if it's a good thing.
[01:10:29.754 --> 01:10:37.400]  They're hoping that you're so devoid of your own morals or compass that now that we're rudderless, they can bring in this extremism.
[01:10:39.181 --> 01:10:40.702]  And this is what smart growth is.
[01:10:40.762 --> 01:10:43.825]  This is about the consolidation of power.
[01:10:43.945 --> 01:10:46.847]  Only insider corporations get the contracts.
[01:10:48.527 --> 01:10:53.550]  So when you watch this video that I'm going to be stopping and commenting on, remember, this is not a joke!
[01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:58.333]  They've got a whole bunch of them on this nightmare site that's linked in Paul Watson's articles.
[01:10:58.653 --> 01:11:02.775]  Plannedopolis, elitist agenda for eco-enslavement.
[01:11:04.556 --> 01:11:07.678]  And you guys did make Jesse Ventura the number one search term yesterday.
[01:11:08.018 --> 01:11:09.079]  Jesse Ventura censored.
[01:11:10.416 --> 01:11:11.656]  I want to do this again today.
[01:11:11.676 --> 01:11:13.057]  I waited a few weeks before we did this.
[01:11:13.437 --> 01:11:16.338]  Now we're going to launch a full-scale Google bomb operation.
[01:11:17.238 --> 01:11:25.360]  I want prison cities to be the number one search term today so that hundreds of other publications pick up on it.
[01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:36.623]  You notice the Mail, the Huffington Post, all these big publications picked up on our government testing angle on the bird deaths now proliferating worldwide.
[01:11:39.963 --> 01:11:48.891]  We can punch through together, if we work together, we can punch through together and force people to see their own admissions of prison cities.
[01:11:49.271 --> 01:11:53.375]  They just want to show these videos to your school kids in the US, England, and Europe.
[01:11:54.476 --> 01:12:00.841]  See, they're already in a more advanced stage of brainwashing because they know they're a captive audience and are more easily manipulated.
[01:12:00.981 --> 01:12:04.885]  Like Al Gore said two years ago, hey, if your parents don't listen to you, you tell them what's right.
[01:12:06.414 --> 01:12:08.215]  You tell them what I tell you to tell them.
[01:12:08.435 --> 01:12:12.878]  The New York Times, little girls going home writing fake tickets to their mommy for taking a hot bath.
[01:12:13.539 --> 01:12:14.540]  They mean business!
[01:12:16.941 --> 01:12:31.091]  And again, real murderers, real fascists, real eugenicists learned, and they, Eugenics Quarterly changed its name, all these groups admittedly became crypto-eugenicists after Hitler embarrassed them.
[01:12:33.010 --> 01:12:35.690]  Up until the 1940s, it was all out in the open.
[01:12:36.551 --> 01:12:39.131]  And so now they pose as loving liberals.
[01:12:39.191 --> 01:12:43.412]  These people, in their own writings, all of them, slather with hatred.
[01:12:43.752 --> 01:12:55.614]  And the Copenhagen thing coming out, that it was all a fraud, and the global warming was all a fraud, made them so mad, literally hundreds of top professors, we write articles every week about it, it's all over mainstream news, say, yes, we want fascism.
[01:12:56.354 --> 01:12:57.594]  Eco-fascism is good.
[01:12:57.954 --> 01:12:59.175]  Nazism is good.
[01:12:59.455 --> 01:13:01.475]  But against all humans, we're a parasite.
[01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:07.965]  Again, three and a half, almost four years ago, Endgame wasn't done yet.
[01:13:09.647 --> 01:13:11.950]  I was working on a Saturday late at the office.
[01:13:13.592 --> 01:13:16.094]  The ballet recital was nearby my office.
[01:13:17.119 --> 01:13:22.124]  My wife and my parents show up with my children with my middle daughter in her ballerina outfit.
[01:13:22.605 --> 01:13:23.545]  They're a little bit early.
[01:13:23.806 --> 01:13:25.347]  They come in and I'm editing the film.
[01:13:25.367 --> 01:13:26.909]  There's research documents everywhere.
[01:13:27.269 --> 01:13:30.012]  Rob Jacobson, Aaron Dykes, we're all in there on a Saturday afternoon.
[01:13:30.392 --> 01:13:35.938]  And my mother watches part of the intro, the part you just saw last hour, and she says, that can't be true.
[01:13:36.018 --> 01:13:38.741]  I know about eugenics and some of this, but it just can't be true.
[01:13:39.361 --> 01:13:44.805]  And my dad goes, actually, when I was at UT, before he was at UT, he was top of his class in high school.
[01:13:45.326 --> 01:13:46.287]  They had this advancement.
[01:13:46.307 --> 01:13:47.848]  They brought in several hundred students.
[01:13:48.248 --> 01:13:49.469]  He was in the top six.
[01:13:49.890 --> 01:13:52.392]  They brought him aside, told him, world government's coming.
[01:13:52.772 --> 01:13:54.253]  We want to advance you guys.
[01:13:54.353 --> 01:13:55.374]  Eugenics is good.
[01:13:55.394 --> 01:14:00.458]  And my dad told my mother that as we drove to the ballet recital.
[01:14:00.698 --> 01:14:01.899]  And her mouth was hanging open.
[01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:04.041]  They tell everybody this stuff.
[01:14:05.222 --> 01:14:06.423]  Every major university.
[01:14:06.443 --> 01:14:07.564]  That's all that's taught.
[01:14:09.167 --> 01:14:09.607]  Okay?
[01:14:10.788 --> 01:14:20.076]  And it teaches the so-called elitist, everybody who's got a high IQ, who gets advanced in these systems, that you're the best, you're gonna survive, we're gonna get rid of the profane.
[01:14:20.457 --> 01:14:27.583]  I mean, my father couldn't even go to UT as a high schooler and not be brainwashed about this.
[01:14:29.124 --> 01:14:31.906]  But he understood what it was because he was already so widely read.
[01:14:32.347 --> 01:14:34.488]  This is everything, okay?
[01:14:34.809 --> 01:14:36.150]  This is what they're doing!
[01:14:37.662 --> 01:14:44.046]  Now, let's go ahead and start playing this nightmare clip, and we have links to the group, the organization, all of it.
[01:14:44.927 --> 01:14:50.551]  This is part of the same affiliated group that put out the video of the kids' heads blowing off if they don't submit to carbon taxing.
[01:14:51.071 --> 01:14:51.531]  Here it is.
[01:14:51.571 --> 01:14:52.352]  This is not a joke.
[01:14:52.392 --> 01:14:52.772]  Here it is.
[01:14:56.535 --> 01:14:57.755]  Forum for the Future.
[01:14:58.756 --> 01:14:59.817]  Action for a Sustainable World.
[01:15:01.735 --> 01:15:04.337]  How will the people travel in the cities of the future?
[01:15:04.357 --> 01:15:04.997]  This is the text.
[01:15:05.378 --> 01:15:06.658]  Mega cities on the move.
[01:15:07.019 --> 01:15:09.581]  Your guide to the future of sustainable urban mobility.
[01:15:10.701 --> 01:15:11.942]  Plannedopolis.
[01:15:12.663 --> 01:15:16.345]  One of four episodes in a world of fossil fuels and expensive energy.
[01:15:16.365 --> 01:15:19.748]  The only solution is tightly planned and controlled urban transport.
[01:15:22.418 --> 01:15:23.559]  Global climate change.
[01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:24.460]  Deal imminent.
[01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:25.602]  This is news headlines.
[01:15:26.122 --> 01:15:27.584]  Joint venture to get city ready.
[01:15:27.844 --> 01:15:30.147]  Floating cities approved because of rising tides.
[01:15:30.447 --> 01:15:31.188]  Global food.
[01:15:31.808 --> 01:15:32.289]  Rations.
[01:15:33.350 --> 01:15:34.291]  Food to be planned.
[01:15:34.371 --> 01:15:35.673]  Welcome to the planned economy.
[01:15:35.973 --> 01:15:37.575]  Government takes over all food production.
[01:15:42.681 --> 01:15:42.861]  Oh, hi.
[01:15:43.582 --> 01:15:45.482]  I'm so glad you're on time.
[01:15:45.862 --> 01:15:49.764]  I'm V. I'm looking forward to showing you around Plandopolis today.
[01:15:49.784 --> 01:15:51.584]  They show the subservient woman.
[01:15:51.624 --> 01:15:52.605]  He works from home.
[01:15:52.965 --> 01:15:56.606]  He's a virtual engineer working in one of the city's desalination plants.
[01:15:57.146 --> 01:15:59.567]  He controls the robots who do all the important maintenance.
[01:15:59.587 --> 01:16:02.708]  I think he basically plays computer games for a living.
[01:16:05.171 --> 01:16:05.871]  Are you ready to go?
[01:16:06.472 --> 01:16:08.393]  Have you got your calorie card open on your smartphone?
[01:16:08.813 --> 01:16:09.194]  It paused.
[01:16:09.214 --> 01:16:10.955]  I registered your visit with Slicked.
[01:16:11.335 --> 01:16:13.096]  This was completely written by MI6.
[01:16:13.316 --> 01:16:17.919]  All of it has little psychological cues like, don't worry, you'll still have your video games.
[01:16:18.299 --> 01:16:20.961]  You look at her husband, he's jacked in like a cyborg.
[01:16:20.981 --> 01:16:24.083]  Because the oceans rose and destroyed everything.
[01:16:24.643 --> 01:16:25.624]  And this is still taught.
[01:16:26.144 --> 01:16:26.925]  Complete lie.
[01:16:27.225 --> 01:16:27.865]  They don't care.
[01:16:28.446 --> 01:16:29.026]  Let's continue.
[01:16:30.049 --> 01:16:34.052]  Travel Corp the other day, so they've allotted you a journey time to match mine.
[01:16:34.072 --> 01:16:36.474]  It makes so much sense, doesn't it?
[01:16:37.015 --> 01:16:39.217]  Switch off brain and go to work.
[01:16:39.977 --> 01:16:43.480]  With this many people around, I'm glad there's a mega-computer in charge.
[01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:44.221]  Hit pause.
[01:16:45.002 --> 01:16:46.583]  We're... Back it up a few seconds.
[01:16:46.603 --> 01:16:47.163]  Good job, guys.
[01:16:48.024 --> 01:16:53.848]  You notice all these movements we're just now hearing about, about a mega-computer fairly giving out all the resources?
[01:16:53.868 --> 01:16:57.951]  Because the government's always real fair with their statistics and things.
[01:16:57.991 --> 01:16:59.072]  None of that would ever be gamed.
[01:16:59.552 --> 01:17:08.158]  Notice all the movements we hear about that are the big solution, that are supposedly grassroots, that the mainstream media then embraces, telling us how the mega-computer will run everything?
[01:17:08.859 --> 01:17:10.300]  That stuff's a hundred years old.
[01:17:11.872 --> 01:17:12.833]  That's what they plan.
[01:17:13.213 --> 01:17:17.657]  Then they have the grassroots put it out to make people think it's legitimate.
[01:17:17.977 --> 01:17:21.219]  That it's coming from the grassroots, as Cass Sunstein said they would do.
[01:17:21.540 --> 01:17:22.821]  Let's continue.
[01:17:22.861 --> 01:17:25.223]  I'm glad there's a mega-computer in charge.
[01:17:26.764 --> 01:17:27.885]  We're so lucky.
[01:17:27.985 --> 01:17:31.788]  Our kids were allocated a school quite near my practice so I can drop them off on the way.
[01:17:31.808 --> 01:17:33.589]  It saves on our calorie ration.
[01:17:33.990 --> 01:17:36.792]  Well, it won't be long until the little darlings get their career announcements.
[01:17:37.272 --> 01:17:38.253]  They've been working so hard.
[01:17:39.861 --> 01:17:42.682]  The little darlings get their career announcements.
[01:17:42.762 --> 01:17:44.902]  This is what Bill Gates is funding all over the world.
[01:17:45.162 --> 01:17:48.923]  The government and corporate sponsors will tell you what you're going to be.
[01:17:49.563 --> 01:17:50.603]  That's freedom, isn't it?
[01:17:50.823 --> 01:17:52.004]  The old caste society.
[01:17:52.484 --> 01:17:57.325]  And there's a calorie ration, and they've been allotted to be allowed to travel to work.
[01:17:58.005 --> 01:17:59.505]  They gotta get an allotment every day.
[01:17:59.545 --> 01:18:00.805]  This is all going to happen.
[01:18:01.005 --> 01:18:02.006]  This is all going in.
[01:18:02.526 --> 01:18:07.707]  I have the New York Times from two days ago saying cameras will be everywhere watching us at all times.
[01:18:08.786 --> 01:18:11.529]  But don't worry, it's AI, so it's not violating your rights.
[01:18:11.789 --> 01:18:12.349]  Continue.
[01:18:13.330 --> 01:18:14.812]  I'm sure they'll get something good.
[01:18:15.292 --> 01:18:18.635]  Not that there's anything wrong with fixing carbon scrubbers for a living or anything.
[01:18:19.656 --> 01:18:20.317]  Are you hungry?
[01:18:21.418 --> 01:18:22.919]  Let's pop to the market as we pass.
[01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:26.703]  Right, what's on the menu this month?
[01:18:27.463 --> 01:18:28.744]  No, not meat.
[01:18:28.824 --> 01:18:29.925]  It's not your birthday.
[01:18:31.092 --> 01:18:35.797]  The Global Food Council are doing a really good job of keeping food production going.
[01:18:36.378 --> 01:18:40.122]  I mean, you don't get the choice you used to, but we're better off than most.
[01:18:40.142 --> 01:18:44.567]  I think it's probably easiest to walk from here.
[01:18:45.167 --> 01:18:48.491]  You barely see a car in the city centre nowadays, unless you're rich.
[01:18:50.356 --> 01:18:51.237]  Oh, the state knows.
[01:18:51.278 --> 01:18:52.579]  They just aren't practical anymore.
[01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:54.843]  We're all trying to meet our global carbon deal.
[01:18:55.764 --> 01:18:58.908]  Electric bikes are so much better for getting around our neighbourhood.
[01:18:59.209 --> 01:19:03.134]  And why waste valuable space on car parks when you can use them to grow food?
[01:19:04.659 --> 01:19:06.360]  I don't care what you say, Alex.
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:08.720]  They don't deserve to live in that ghetto.
[01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:11.041]  They are completely disconnected.
[01:19:11.521 --> 01:19:14.502]  No high-speed transport system, no new internet.
[01:19:14.802 --> 01:19:17.623]  They miss out on jobs and many essential services, too.
[01:19:18.563 --> 01:19:20.324]  Oh, hi again.
[01:19:21.284 --> 01:19:21.824]  What a day.
[01:19:21.844 --> 01:19:26.326]  I had to make an emergency visit to the Cry Freedom Ghettos.
[01:19:26.486 --> 01:19:32.728]  I mean, I miss my sister like mad, but I'm glad they went when they were moving Lisa down.
[01:19:33.448 --> 01:19:33.889]  Hit pause.
[01:19:34.229 --> 01:19:38.173]  They even get you ready for everybody being put in the ghettos.
[01:19:38.494 --> 01:19:40.115]  If you don't like this, you go to a ghetto.
[01:19:40.396 --> 01:19:46.342]  But then, you're also in a prison in the high-tech grid, so they even get you ready for that, that there's gonna be people that won't like it.
[01:19:46.803 --> 01:19:47.323]  Like H.G.
[01:19:47.363 --> 01:19:53.029]  Wells said, there'll be many gallant, young, beautiful people that have to be killed for the new world order to come in.
[01:19:53.049 --> 01:19:54.471]  So they're even getting you ready for that.
[01:19:54.691 --> 01:19:55.312]  We'll be right back.
[01:19:59.423 --> 01:20:02.704]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[01:20:03.504 --> 01:20:07.746]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[01:20:08.006 --> 01:20:13.948]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[01:20:14.168 --> 01:20:16.309]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[01:20:16.589 --> 01:20:22.571]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[01:20:22.691 --> 01:20:26.033]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[01:20:26.093 --> 01:20:27.795]  There is no other program of its kind.
[01:20:27.975 --> 01:20:30.016]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[01:20:30.156 --> 01:20:34.819]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.
[01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:35.660]  Guaranteed.
[01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:39.883]  Prevent wage garnishments, bank levies, and stop collection calls with our proven program.
[01:20:40.123 --> 01:20:48.152]  Call Zero Debt in 90 days now, 800-477-9256 and ask for free information from an expert who also completed our program.
[01:20:48.172 --> 01:20:48.893]  800-477-9256 or ZeroDebtGuaranteed.com.
[01:20:48.913 --> 01:20:49.734]  800-477-9256 or ZeroDebtGuaranteed.com.
[01:20:59.181 --> 01:21:02.826]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[01:21:03.247 --> 01:21:08.675]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[01:21:09.136 --> 01:21:10.217]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[01:21:10.237 --> 01:21:14.243]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:21:14.924 --> 01:21:28.395]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[01:21:28.735 --> 01:21:34.040]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[01:21:34.340 --> 01:21:40.245]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[01:21:40.985 --> 01:21:42.246]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:42.266 --> 01:21:43.767]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[01:21:43.787 --> 01:21:44.227]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:44.247 --> 01:21:46.408]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[01:21:46.428 --> 01:21:46.488]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:59.935 --> 01:22:02.119]  Folks, you've heard us talk about Home Gain before.

[01:22:59.127 --> 01:23:03.429]  Fight back this cold and flu season with the world's best garlic extract, Ali-C.
[01:23:03.589 --> 01:23:04.389]  Why Ali-C?
[01:23:04.449 --> 01:23:07.810]  Because it helps your body fight viruses, bacteria, and fungi.
[01:23:08.010 --> 01:23:15.693]  Ali-C has been scientifically proven in double-blind studies using low doses to greatly reduce the number, severity, and duration of common colds.
[01:23:16.073 --> 01:23:21.436]  Ali-C contains 300 milligrams of stabilized allicin, the active ingredient in crushed garlic.
[01:23:21.636 --> 01:23:26.318]  Studies show Ali-C is effective against MRSA, bacterial, fungal, and viral infections.
[01:23:26.858 --> 01:23:30.220]  One tablet of Ali-C has the equivalent of 40 cloves of garlic.
[01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:36.703]  Ali-C supports your body's resistance to all types of conditions and can help lower high blood pressure and high cholesterol.
[01:23:37.003 --> 01:23:46.545]  So boost your body's resistance to infection with nature's best garlic extract, Alley C. For more information and to order Alley C, call 877-888-7126 or go to GarlicHealthProducts.com.

[01:24:00.277 --> 01:24:05.419]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:06.100 --> 01:24:08.381]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:24:09.201 --> 01:24:28.249]  So they're taking their time brainwashing our children, getting their systems in place, passing their carbon taxes, and when our Congress won't pass laws that couple in with the new international agreements, the EPA just enforces it on states like Texas with no law.
[01:24:29.551 --> 01:24:30.751]  This is tyranny.
[01:24:31.192 --> 01:24:35.933]  And that's what they've said in the last year in the London Guardian and all over foreign news and here in the U.S.
[01:24:36.473 --> 01:24:40.815]  Oh, if the people won't go along with this, we've got to have it be authoritarian for their own good.
[01:24:42.796 --> 01:24:48.658]  This is just authoritarian control freaks posing as good guys and claiming they're trying to save you.
[01:24:51.039 --> 01:24:56.921]  Let's finish up with this bizarre, one-of-four-part brainwashing pieces of the world they're going to build.
[01:24:57.759 --> 01:24:58.420]  Let's continue.
[01:24:59.460 --> 01:25:02.002]  Safe from climate change on the floating city.
[01:25:03.223 --> 01:25:04.084]  That must be her now.
[01:25:05.065 --> 01:25:07.627]  It's much easier to meet up with friends virtually now.
[01:25:07.827 --> 01:25:10.189]  So many cities have banned cars in central areas.
[01:25:12.111 --> 01:25:14.012]  Looks like she's got some juicy gossip.
[01:25:18.276 --> 01:25:22.039]  Find out more about how we can live and travel in the cities of the future.
[01:25:22.059 --> 01:25:24.201]  Forumforthefuture.org
[01:25:26.018 --> 01:25:32.903]  And they've got a bunch more of these nightmare videos of how cruel it is that she's not allowed to travel unless she has authorization.
[01:25:32.923 --> 01:25:38.766]  And then Prince Charles addressed Austin last year and many other cities via hologram.
[01:25:38.786 --> 01:25:44.850]  You know, he addresses the city council and people and talks about how he doesn't travel for his carbon footprint.
[01:25:44.870 --> 01:25:49.674]  Meanwhile, he owns two private trains, scores of jet aircraft, tons of palaces.
[01:25:52.515 --> 01:25:54.737]  But then he does stunts about how he doesn't travel now.
[01:25:56.889 --> 01:25:59.049]  And how only essential travel should be allowed.
[01:26:00.090 --> 01:26:02.470]  Everything you see there is now being rolled out and promoted.
[01:26:02.950 --> 01:26:10.012]  Now I want to get into Paul Joseph Watson's articles on this, and I beg of you, make this the number one search term today.
[01:26:10.472 --> 01:26:13.973]  And yes, Google blocks us out, so people won't be able to see it.
[01:26:15.953 --> 01:26:19.294]  You're all fully authorized to take these articles and post them on your site.
[01:26:20.103 --> 01:26:20.664]  Your blog.
[01:26:21.125 --> 01:26:22.548]  Email them out to everyone you want.
[01:26:22.988 --> 01:26:24.752]  Prison cities.
[01:26:25.333 --> 01:26:29.400]  Prison cities is the search term.
[01:26:30.657 --> 01:26:31.737]  Prison Cities.
[01:26:32.078 --> 01:26:33.338]  Let's fire another torpedo.
[01:26:33.738 --> 01:26:35.899]  Torpedo number two, flooding chamber now.
[01:26:36.220 --> 01:26:36.760]  Fire!
[01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:38.761]  Eco-fascist.
[01:26:39.581 --> 01:26:40.982]  Eco-fascist.
[01:26:41.962 --> 01:26:43.263]  Eco-fascist.
[01:26:43.863 --> 01:26:44.983]  And let's make them even madder.
[01:26:45.023 --> 01:26:47.104]  Let's show them the real power of the Info Warriors.
[01:26:47.425 --> 01:26:48.745]  Torpedo one, Prison Cities.
[01:26:48.785 --> 01:26:50.446]  Torpedo two, Eco-fascist.
[01:26:50.466 --> 01:26:53.107]  Torpedo three, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:26:53.347 --> 01:26:54.468]  Hit them and hit them hard!
[01:26:56.629 --> 01:26:57.209]  They don't like it.
[01:27:00.558 --> 01:27:02.118]  Let's see if we can get one, two, and three.
[01:27:02.338 --> 01:27:04.719]  We've gotten the top three in a row repeatedly.
[01:27:05.059 --> 01:27:06.459]  Maybe I should fire another torpedo.
[01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:11.481]  That's up to you if these torpedoes hit the enemy.
[01:27:11.821 --> 01:27:13.981]  Eco-fascists call for prison cities.
[01:27:14.501 --> 01:27:15.241]  Here's the article.
[01:27:15.742 --> 01:27:21.223]  Obey and borrow tyranny or be banished to a ghetto threatens new government-funded propaganda piece.
[01:27:22.363 --> 01:27:24.284]  Remember the British invented concentration camps.
[01:27:26.264 --> 01:27:27.864]  They call them reservations here.
[01:27:29.145 --> 01:27:29.725]  And in Africa.
[01:27:30.916 --> 01:27:31.837]  That's how you deal with it.
[01:27:33.358 --> 01:27:46.788]  People who resist, by the way that came out of the eugenics plan, people who resist the state controlling every aspect of their existence will be forced to live in squalid ghettos while the rest of the population will be tightly controlled in high-tech prison cities.
[01:27:47.268 --> 01:27:53.713]  That's the future envisioned by eco-fascists who are exploiting the contrived global warming fraud to openly flaunt their plan.
[01:27:54.670 --> 01:27:56.693]  For total enslavement of mankind.
[01:27:56.713 --> 01:28:00.898]  And then I'm going to get into all the documents in the next segment of the actual physical tracking grid.
[01:28:02.182 --> 01:28:11.145]  The threat posed by the kind of scenario being promoted for the Forum of the Future, the group responsible for the chilling video below, cannot be emphasized enough.
[01:28:11.926 --> 01:28:22.310]  The dictatorial hellhole where cars will be banned, meat rationed, farming completely abolished, and overtaken by the state, behavior catalogued by calorie cards.
[01:28:22.330 --> 01:28:26.491]  And notice the EPA is now saying, no dust is allowed from farming.
[01:28:26.591 --> 01:28:27.211]  You're farming.
[01:28:27.332 --> 01:28:28.372]  Big aggregate's a waiver.
[01:28:30.495 --> 01:28:34.821]  It's written where they can shut down your farm, your ranch, even the date tree in your backyard.
[01:28:36.483 --> 01:28:38.365]  It says Codex Alimentarius in the bill.
[01:28:38.546 --> 01:28:38.886]  U.N.
[01:28:39.347 --> 01:28:42.431]  Everything they're passing is U.N., U.N., U.N., U.N.
[01:28:43.672 --> 01:28:46.096]  See, when I read all this, all of it's being phased in.
[01:28:47.679 --> 01:28:48.399]  Meat rationed.
[01:28:48.459 --> 01:28:50.000]  Farming, the British government proposed that.
[01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:52.320]  Farming completely abolished and overtaken by the state.
[01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:53.420]  That's Stalin.
[01:28:53.640 --> 01:29:04.243]  Behavior cataloged by calorie cards and careers ordained by the government is the ultimate goal of the control freaks who have seized the reins of the environmental movement.
[01:29:05.743 --> 01:29:16.486]  Nearly every aspect of the policies undertaken by the global dictatorship that runs the planned opulence depicted in the video are lifted wholesale from historical tyrannies.
[01:29:19.244 --> 01:29:22.446]  The state completely taking over the means of food production and farming.
[01:29:22.646 --> 01:29:28.808]  This is a throwback to the Soviet system of collectivized farming, where Stalin organized land and labor into large-scale collective farms.
[01:29:29.109 --> 01:29:35.772]  Farmers who resisted the state taking over their farms were arrested and sent to Siberian gulags, or the new cities.
[01:29:36.892 --> 01:29:37.413]  The ghettos.
[01:29:37.873 --> 01:29:38.813]  We're going to come right back.
[01:29:38.933 --> 01:29:40.954]  I mean, it is hardcore.
[01:29:41.334 --> 01:29:42.455]  This is the issue.
[01:29:43.175 --> 01:29:48.858]  Not the scary Muslims in turbans they dance out on TV for you, openly run by the globalists.
[01:29:49.673 --> 01:29:52.655]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.675 --> 01:29:56.258]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.946 --> 01:30:02.549]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:30:02.949 --> 01:30:07.914]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:30:08.294 --> 01:30:10.016]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:30:10.336 --> 01:30:15.161]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:30:15.341 --> 01:30:16.302]  How much do you want?
[01:30:16.523 --> 01:30:17.263]  When do you want it?
[01:30:17.644 --> 01:30:19.245]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:30:19.546 --> 01:30:20.366]  When will you need it?
[01:30:20.607 --> 01:30:22.669]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:30:22.809 --> 01:30:23.850]  Will there be any food?
[01:30:24.130 --> 01:30:28.052]  Will it make your children sick if there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself?
[01:30:28.192 --> 01:30:30.713]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:30:30.933 --> 01:30:34.095]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:30:34.515 --> 01:30:38.016]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:30:38.317 --> 01:30:39.317]  How much will you need?
[01:30:39.557 --> 01:30:40.177]  We don't know.
[01:30:40.458 --> 01:30:41.378]  How much do you want?
[01:30:41.558 --> 01:30:42.278]  All you can get.
[01:30:42.298 --> 01:30:43.299]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:43.579 --> 01:30:46.340]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:30:46.620 --> 01:30:49.742]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:30:49.762 --> 01:30:50.522]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:31:00.228 --> 01:31:03.850]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:31:04.230 --> 01:31:07.252]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:31:07.492 --> 01:31:12.255]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:31:12.275 --> 01:31:18.518]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:31:18.678 --> 01:31:20.900]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:31:21.460 --> 01:31:21.720]  Tim Geithner?
[01:31:21.740 --> 01:31:21.901]  Bernanke?
[01:31:21.921 --> 01:31:22.261]  They're arsonists!
[01:31:22.281 --> 01:31:22.922]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:31:22.982 --> 01:31:24.664]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:31:40.342 --> 01:31:47.270]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:31:47.631 --> 01:31:56.741]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:31:58.936 --> 01:32:00.537]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:32:00.577 --> 01:32:03.379]  You've heard me talk about Cal Bend 5 Star Soaps for years.
[01:32:03.939 --> 01:32:08.882]  This is an American made product of the highest quality and compares to nothing you will find in stores.
[01:32:09.162 --> 01:32:12.344]  You can buy factory direct, shipped via UPS right to your door.
[01:32:12.604 --> 01:32:14.946]  Check them out on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[01:32:15.586 --> 01:32:16.447]  Or call 800-340-7091.
[01:32:19.109 --> 01:32:20.050]  Take my word for it.
[01:32:20.250 --> 01:32:22.572]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[01:32:22.893 --> 01:32:29.118]  Since 1947, Calvin's Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[01:32:29.418 --> 01:32:30.820]  Buy American and stay clean.

[01:32:51.281 --> 01:32:52.101]  Thank you!
[01:33:04.301 --> 01:33:10.609]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:15.676 --> 01:33:17.718]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:18.812 --> 01:33:28.215]  So what they're doing is, in a fun little, you know, happy, it's always presented by a woman, who Hitler said, first you get the women, then you've got the children, so follow the men.
[01:33:28.235 --> 01:33:35.497]  Edward Bernays, the father of modern advertising, nephew of Sigmund Freud, said you get the women, they make 80% of the purchases.
[01:33:36.297 --> 01:33:37.278]  Still the same today.
[01:33:37.718 --> 01:33:42.219]  You get the women, then you've got the children, so follow the men.
[01:33:42.739 --> 01:33:44.600]  Women are at the center of the family.
[01:33:45.526 --> 01:33:46.587]  And the center of culture.
[01:33:46.607 --> 01:33:49.028]  It's not that women are bad, it's that women are key.
[01:33:49.488 --> 01:33:52.049]  And they know that women on average are more conformist.
[01:33:52.710 --> 01:33:56.232]  And if things are presented in a happy-go-lucky way, they will do it.
[01:33:56.472 --> 01:34:08.278]  Aztec women would bring their child up, bind it, give it to the priest, and be happy that their newborn baby, or their toddler, bound with a rock, was thrown into a deep chasm of water.
[01:34:08.818 --> 01:34:10.239]  That's how they like to kill kids, mainly.
[01:34:11.679 --> 01:34:13.821]  And it's the same thing.
[01:34:14.961 --> 01:34:15.902]  This is how they do it.
[01:34:16.522 --> 01:34:20.444]  And so you notice the ads for high fructose corn syrup that they run.
[01:34:20.864 --> 01:34:29.189]  It's the woman with her boyfriend in idyllic pastoral scenes over and over again, different variants, or in a park or at a backyard party.
[01:34:29.569 --> 01:34:32.391]  And the woman's handing out the food, always in a position of authority.
[01:34:34.085 --> 01:34:40.929]  And, you know, she's the boss, and she tells her husband, or her boyfriend, go ahead and have the popsicle.
[01:34:41.389 --> 01:34:42.510]  Go ahead and eat of the fruit.
[01:34:42.930 --> 01:34:44.691]  No, corn syrup's not bad for you.
[01:34:44.711 --> 01:34:45.732]  It's quite good for you.
[01:34:45.992 --> 01:34:55.537]  And then she'll give him some scientific stuff, and the husband admits, or the boyfriend admits he's an idiot, or there'll be another moron woman who the Queen Bee corrects and explains to.
[01:34:56.258 --> 01:34:58.499]  And so this is how they always target it.
[01:34:58.959 --> 01:35:10.148]  This is how they work it, just like if you went back to a plantation 170 years ago in Alabama, and you rode up in your carriage, you'd be met by several big black women.
[01:35:10.748 --> 01:35:14.832]  And they could speak clear English, they could probably even read, and this was their operation.
[01:35:15.392 --> 01:35:18.755]  And sometimes they even bossed Master around, if you read the cultural histories.
[01:35:18.975 --> 01:35:24.379]  And the men were kept out in the barn and hardly could talk, and those women would go back there and just beat them down!
[01:35:24.399 --> 01:35:24.439]  Ha!
[01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:26.901]  You learn, you boy!
[01:35:27.862 --> 01:35:29.443]  Now that's how it works in Rome.
[01:35:29.563 --> 01:35:30.764]  Caesar did the same thing.
[01:35:31.004 --> 01:35:34.446]  He'd roll into Albion, or Germany, or Gaul.
[01:35:34.846 --> 01:35:40.469]  First thing they'd do is slaughter all the men, and then they'd sit there and beat those little boys in front of their women.
[01:35:40.629 --> 01:35:46.572]  They'd take a teenager, slit their throat, and they'd say to the women, you keep them in line or we're gonna kill all of them!
[01:35:46.972 --> 01:35:53.976]  And those women would just absolutely suppress their men forever, back in Rome, or wherever they were taken to plantations.
[01:35:54.996 --> 01:35:55.977]  Austria, you name it.
[01:35:58.537 --> 01:35:59.899]  I've got all the handbooks on it.
[01:35:59.919 --> 01:36:01.860]  These are all publicly shown to you on air.
[01:36:02.361 --> 01:36:08.006]  I've got slave manuals from the sugar cane operations in the Caribbean.
[01:36:08.026 --> 01:36:14.251]  What was the former name of what's Haiti and Dominican Republic?
[01:36:15.773 --> 01:36:16.594]  Hispaniola.
[01:36:17.815 --> 01:36:19.556]  I got a manual from Hispaniola, 1701.
[01:36:19.756 --> 01:36:22.339]  Gotta dig that back out.
[01:36:23.993 --> 01:36:26.734]  I mean, this is how they run it, and they run it well!
[01:36:27.435 --> 01:36:29.135]  They know exactly what they're doing!
[01:36:32.877 --> 01:36:41.161]  You've seen all the old black and white movies from the 30s and 40s, where they phased it out, political correctness, where it shows the black mammy running everything?
[01:36:42.021 --> 01:36:53.326]  My dad grew up in East Texas, cotton farming, and with black foreman women who were bossing around the poor white farmhands.
[01:36:55.182 --> 01:36:56.283]  This is how it works.
[01:36:57.343 --> 01:36:59.784]  And that's basically what Oprah Winfrey is.
[01:37:01.305 --> 01:37:03.166]  And that's how the globalists operate.
[01:37:03.506 --> 01:37:03.826]  Okay?
[01:37:03.886 --> 01:37:06.107]  And you need to get that through your head.
[01:37:06.147 --> 01:37:09.749]  You need to understand they know scientifically what they're doing.
[01:37:10.449 --> 01:37:10.789]  Okay?
[01:37:12.550 --> 01:37:20.614]  I remember reading in some of the Caribbean manuals, which were then exported and translated into English for use by the slave owners here in what is the United States today,
[01:37:22.037 --> 01:37:29.868]  uh... in virginia and other areas and uh... described how even when they took slaves off the boat they would and they even cited the roman manuals
[01:37:31.128 --> 01:37:36.669]  How they would take the biggest, strongest, clear leader of the blacks that survived.
[01:37:36.869 --> 01:37:46.351]  You can always tell by everybody looking to them to kind of get their orders who was seen as the dominant black male getting whoever survived the coffin ship off.
[01:37:46.631 --> 01:37:53.272]  Whether it was Boston or New York or Galveston, Texas or New Orleans, Louisiana.
[01:37:53.632 --> 01:37:54.872]  And they're getting them off the ship.
[01:37:54.912 --> 01:37:56.353]  They bring them up there to the block.
[01:37:56.613 --> 01:37:57.813]  But before they even do that,
[01:37:58.803 --> 01:38:08.388]  They would beat to death or kill one of the strongest, most intelligent, obvious leaders in front of the women, and then they would have their translator explain it all to them.
[01:38:09.768 --> 01:38:11.829]  I mean, they got it all figured out, okay?
[01:38:12.609 --> 01:38:14.690]  Feminism, CIA funded the whole deal.
[01:38:15.311 --> 01:38:16.431]  And they've done a good job.
[01:38:16.451 --> 01:38:17.932]  Look, our society is completely destroyed.
[01:38:18.372 --> 01:38:21.814]  All right, getting back to the eco-fascist Adolf Hitler.
[01:38:22.094 --> 01:38:24.395]  First you get the women, then you got the children, so follow the men.
[01:38:24.795 --> 01:38:26.076]  Adolf Alois Hitler.
[01:38:27.442 --> 01:38:31.146]  Continuing, eco-fascist call for prison cities.
[01:38:31.707 --> 01:38:36.591]  People who resist the state control of every aspect of their lives will be forced to live in ghettos.
[01:38:36.811 --> 01:38:39.154]  And you just saw that from the piece.
[01:38:39.814 --> 01:38:42.517]  And they admit that there'll be farming run by the state.
[01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:50.385]  Continuing, Stalin organized land labor into large-scale collective farms.
[01:38:50.425 --> 01:38:51.225]  Farmers who resisted
[01:38:52.338 --> 01:38:53.518]  State taking over their farms.
[01:38:54.018 --> 01:38:55.399]  That'll be big agribusiness doing it.
[01:38:55.899 --> 01:38:57.819]  Were arrested and sent to Siberian gulags.
[01:38:57.879 --> 01:39:04.041]  As a result, the mass seizure of property and the disruption that collected farming brought to food production.
[01:39:04.481 --> 01:39:09.062]  Upwards of 3 million people died from starvation from 1932 to 1933 alone.
[01:39:09.342 --> 01:39:10.443]  Well yeah, that was just Ukraine.
[01:39:11.443 --> 01:39:13.185]  There's over 20 mil in starvation overall.
[01:39:13.645 --> 01:39:22.494]  A similar system imposed in Maoist China under the Great Leap Forward led to the Great Chinese Famine and the starvation of at least 36 million people.
[01:39:22.574 --> 01:39:23.475]  That was planned as well.
[01:39:23.495 --> 01:39:25.317]  We've had top historians on that subject.
[01:39:27.239 --> 01:39:44.667]  Incarceration of resistors and green fascism inside squalid ghettos and their subsequent separation from family members is a frightening throwback to Nazi-run Warsaw Ghetto and other concentration camps and prisons within cities that housed Jews and political dissidents during World War II.
[01:39:46.287 --> 01:39:47.168]  The restriction
[01:39:48.775 --> 01:39:58.247]  Or even outlawing of meat, something already being vehemently pushed by eco-fascists, we have links to them saying it, to the point where a hamburger becomes a rare delicacy to be enjoyed on special occasions.
[01:39:58.267 --> 01:40:00.851]  Yeah, the state on your birthday might give you a little meat.
[01:40:01.632 --> 01:40:03.314]  And only then if you can afford it.
[01:40:03.634 --> 01:40:05.377]  Well, that sounds like a North Korean prison camp.
[01:40:07.429 --> 01:40:19.975]  And Watson continues to write, as my wife who is Chinese will attest, up until the late 80s, before China started to lift itself out of poverty, meat was a rare treat that was sparsely available and highly restricted.
[01:40:20.035 --> 01:40:29.799]  Again, the planned opulence is nothing less than a fusion of communist and fascist control measures inflicted upon population to keep them poor, starving, and weak.
[01:40:31.118 --> 01:40:51.119]  The people who produced this video, funded by the monolistic, elitist bankers and corporations like Royal Dutch Shell, Bank of America, as well as British government, Paul has a link to this group, an article about who they're funded by, know very well that every aspect of their plannedopolis is lifted directly from the most abhorrent and brutal dictatorships in history.
[01:40:51.519 --> 01:40:53.460]  And they go on to admit that and they know it.
[01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:54.161]  They're very proud of it.
[01:40:54.521 --> 01:40:58.624]  They are openly flaunting the eco-fascist ideology behind the Green Movement.
[01:40:58.724 --> 01:41:00.846]  They now call themselves eco-fascist.
[01:41:01.046 --> 01:41:03.728]  It's a total embracing of the Hitlerian system.
[01:41:04.889 --> 01:41:11.194]  Of course, as made clear in the video, none of the regulations or controls will apply to any of the elitist imposing them on the rest of us.
[01:41:12.068 --> 01:41:16.590]  See, it looks like a joke in that video because it's meant to flaunt it, to break your will.
[01:41:17.291 --> 01:41:21.012]  Think Al Gore and his multiple oceanside mansions with heated swimming pools?
[01:41:21.533 --> 01:41:25.895]  They will still be able to roll around in SUVs and mansions with heated swimming pools.
[01:41:26.155 --> 01:41:38.341]  They will still be able to, again, roll around and fly around on their private jets while quaffing the finest filet steak and belching tons of CO2 as they lecture the rest of humanity about their carbon footprint.
[01:41:38.581 --> 01:41:50.062]  Think Prince Charles and his insistence that the proles not be allowed to take a bath as he lounges in a luxuriant splendor of royal palaces.
[01:41:51.647 --> 01:41:55.108]  Call Watson up, there's a Phantom S right there at number eight.
[01:41:55.988 --> 01:42:09.211]  Continuing, they are also engaged in a ploy to shift the parameters of the Overton window, which is defined as a range of political policies considered to be politically acceptable in the current climate of public opinion.
[01:42:09.491 --> 01:42:20.454]  By constantly bombarding us with extreme and repugnant proposals, they gradually wear down the human psyche until people begin to accept draconian controls over their personal lives as normal, necessary, and reasonable.
[01:42:21.034 --> 01:42:29.497]  The mind is so strong and ready to face adversity that when you hear about war with Iran coming forever, you subconsciously almost want to see it go ahead and happen.
[01:42:30.038 --> 01:42:37.020]  Or when you hear about mass die-off of humanity promoted by Discovery Channel and all these shows and how it's coming, you almost want to get it over with, see?
[01:42:37.420 --> 01:42:38.961]  It's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[01:42:40.677 --> 01:42:53.479]  This is part of the reason behind last year's Splattergate controversy, where global warming alarmists, again funded by government and big business, produced an infomercial in which children who refused to lower their carbon emissions were slaughtered in an orgy of blood and guts.
[01:42:53.499 --> 01:42:54.360]  We're going to play that in a minute.
[01:42:55.421 --> 01:43:00.505]  This is a psychological attack and a realization of the stepping stone method to tyranny.
[01:43:00.805 --> 01:43:09.752]  Whereas we might not accept cars being banned or meat being rationed now, we will accept incandescent light bulbs being outlawed and paying carbon taxes on fuel.
[01:43:10.072 --> 01:43:11.053]  What's so great about Watson?
[01:43:11.133 --> 01:43:22.621]  I called up to him for 10 minutes and just spewed information and he just sat there without even writing notes and spewed it all right back out with precision and then added his own understanding overlay to this article and wrote this article in about 30 minutes.
[01:43:23.988 --> 01:43:25.150]  Gotta salute Paul Watson.
[01:43:25.170 --> 01:43:26.192]  What an incredible job.
[01:43:26.753 --> 01:43:28.676]  I can't believe he got all of this exactly right.
[01:43:29.177 --> 01:43:34.166]  Spewed at him in 100 miles an hour as I was ranting and guzzling coffee, walking around in my backyard.
[01:43:35.606 --> 01:43:40.509]  This is a psychological attack and a realization of the stepping stone method to tyranny.
[01:43:40.529 --> 01:43:48.813]  Whereas we might not accept cars being banned and meat being rationed now, we will accept incandescent light bulbs being outlawed and paying carbon taxes on fuel.
[01:43:49.213 --> 01:43:57.818]  As each hurdle is cleared, the globals propose something more extreme so that we will always come to a compromise and accept a slighter lesser tyranny.
[01:43:57.998 --> 01:44:02.180]  But in the long term, the elitist achieve all of their goals with aplomb.
[01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:03.861]  Hmm.
[01:44:05.361 --> 01:44:08.967]  Continuing, it's good to read a piece that's just so, so precise.
[01:44:08.987 --> 01:44:12.373]  I love exposing the globalists.
[01:44:14.221 --> 01:44:34.976]  And to top it all off, the debate between the liberals over at the Guardian website in response to the story did not revolve around a castigation of the authoritarian future hell, but a question on whether old people should merely be advised by government workers how to kill themselves when they reach 65, or whether the state should just kill them directly.
[01:44:36.172 --> 01:44:56.751]  Remember Bill Joy, owner of Sun Microsystems, writing 12 years ago now how he went to an elitist meeting of other computer owners, billionaires, and they had debates all weekend about do we just kill everyone or do we entertain them and build a false reality for them because they're not needed because of computers anymore and robotics.
[01:44:57.852 --> 01:44:59.674]  Human life isn't cheap, it's worthless.
[01:45:01.471 --> 01:45:04.693]  And the decision is that you're bad for the earth.
[01:45:04.793 --> 01:45:05.233]  I'm bad.
[01:45:05.313 --> 01:45:06.094]  So we're dead!
[01:45:07.315 --> 01:45:09.896]  And now they're just teaching us by increment how to die!
[01:45:09.916 --> 01:45:13.859]  Remember last year, the cover of Newsweek?
[01:45:13.919 --> 01:45:15.179]  The case for killing Granny?
[01:45:16.340 --> 01:45:18.621]  Oh, there's no death panels, but we want to kill Granny!
[01:45:18.641 --> 01:45:22.844]  And then I saw the Newsweek the week before that.
[01:45:22.884 --> 01:45:23.805]  I can hardly ever even read it.
[01:45:23.825 --> 01:45:24.365]  It's so painful.
[01:45:24.565 --> 01:45:29.008]  They had a weird article with a grim reaper with two old people and how beautiful it is to commit suicide.
[01:45:30.421 --> 01:45:32.202]  But the globalists, they don't commit suicide.
[01:45:32.262 --> 01:45:34.343]  Dick Cheney has a bionic heart.
[01:45:34.583 --> 01:45:36.824]  They've added a bionic part onto it, a pump.
[01:45:37.164 --> 01:45:38.825]  He's trying to get a heart transplant right now.
[01:45:39.025 --> 01:45:40.166]  You notice he's clinging.
[01:45:41.827 --> 01:45:48.310]  You notice the big head, Mr. Jobs of Apple, who funds all this eugenics and promotes it endlessly.
[01:45:48.530 --> 01:45:50.051]  You notice he got a liver transplant.
[01:45:50.431 --> 01:45:52.172]  It was a little suspicious how fast he got it.
[01:45:52.912 --> 01:45:54.053]  Went out to Tennessee to get it.
[01:45:54.773 --> 01:45:56.674]  No discussion of where that goodie came from.
[01:45:56.694 --> 01:45:57.695]  I got a good idea.
[01:46:00.751 --> 01:46:03.555]  Oh, but he's got something to offer, doesn't he?
[01:46:04.696 --> 01:46:04.997]  Uh-huh.
[01:46:06.359 --> 01:46:10.764]  And as if that isn't evil enough, they're not just wanting to get rid of the dumbed-down people, which is horrible.
[01:46:11.826 --> 01:46:13.588]  No, their real target is those that are smart.
[01:46:15.070 --> 01:46:18.355]  That's why they put sterilants and IQ reducers in the water.
[01:46:19.881 --> 01:46:25.466]  And see, I'm not the smartest person in the world, but I've got enough fight in me when people openly write how they're doing that to me.
[01:46:25.766 --> 01:46:34.755]  I tend to get mad, and I tend to get organized, and I tend, for 16 years on air, to try to build an InfoWars weapon system to defend my family.
[01:46:35.535 --> 01:46:38.398]  And to defend my family, I've got to defend everybody else.
[01:46:38.799 --> 01:46:40.660]  We all hang together or hang separate.
[01:46:41.881 --> 01:46:43.583]  I'm getting chills right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:46:44.504 --> 01:46:45.565]  I want to beat these people.
[01:46:47.386 --> 01:46:48.407]  I want to take them on.
[01:46:48.447 --> 01:46:49.567]  I want to bring them down.
[01:46:50.988 --> 01:46:54.650]  But it's going to take you waking up and getting your guts going.
[01:46:55.010 --> 01:46:56.751]  Getting your good old boy guts turned on.
[01:46:57.051 --> 01:46:57.931]  And getting FOCUSED!
[01:46:58.792 --> 01:47:01.013]  You know, the enemy loves to teach us that we've already lost.
[01:47:01.053 --> 01:47:02.254]  We haven't lost, we've won.
[01:47:02.634 --> 01:47:06.136]  They're taking on a bold operation and they're going to fail.
[01:47:06.476 --> 01:47:12.399]  They will fail 100% if you simply decide to take action against them effectively.
[01:47:14.923 --> 01:47:16.184]  A lot of us have committed ourselves 110%.
[01:47:16.244 --> 01:47:18.685]  The least you can do is get active.
[01:47:21.647 --> 01:47:25.369]  So, they go on to debate, do we just kill the old people or ask them to kill themselves?
[01:47:26.510 --> 01:47:27.970]  This is all being openly discussed.
[01:47:28.631 --> 01:47:29.431]  And it's all liberal.
[01:47:29.471 --> 01:47:30.792]  It's all loving killing people.
[01:47:31.973 --> 01:47:42.799]  This kind of despotic destiny is not only being pushed by the elite, it has an army of greenwashed zombies behind it who have been recruited to make the demon side
[01:47:44.344 --> 01:47:49.946]  of the elderly to useless eaters, an intellectually acceptable and reasonable idea.
[01:47:50.006 --> 01:47:57.287]  Presumably, the disabled and the mentally ill will also be exterminated in the pursuit of the highly efficient Planned Opelous.
[01:47:57.628 --> 01:48:00.168]  Another idea which Hitler would have vehemently approved.
[01:48:00.188 --> 01:48:04.669]  He actually designed with Albert Speer the megacities and the environmental grid.
[01:48:04.729 --> 01:48:05.670]  Meat would not be allowed.
[01:48:05.690 --> 01:48:06.670]  You will not be allowed.
[01:48:06.690 --> 01:48:10.091]  I mean, it's total... It's all happening.
[01:48:11.314 --> 01:48:12.995]  Cops are laughing right now because they've been preconditioned.
[01:48:13.015 --> 01:48:13.995]  Just go ahead, laugh all you want.
[01:48:14.015 --> 01:48:14.435]  Go ahead and laugh.
[01:48:14.815 --> 01:48:15.556]  You're part of the structure.
[01:48:15.576 --> 01:48:16.296]  You're going to win, aren't you?
[01:48:16.576 --> 01:48:17.216]  No, you're not going to win.
[01:48:17.236 --> 01:48:17.917]  You're already being killed.
[01:48:19.117 --> 01:48:28.901]  Once government is given the power to kill anyone they deem to be unproductive, this collectivist Orwellian nightmare, the gates of hell are now thrown wide open.
[01:48:29.261 --> 01:48:36.924]  In comparison, meat rationing, carbon taxes, eco-surveillance, calorie credits, and transport restriction will seem like a walk in the park.
[01:48:37.465 --> 01:48:39.566]  Alex Jones' seminal film, Endgame, released in 06,
[01:48:40.666 --> 01:48:41.867]  Produced in 06, released in early 07.
[01:48:42.808 --> 01:48:50.297]  Warned precisely of the kind of high-tech slave grids being implemented that are now routinely proposed by top eco-fascist organizations.
[01:48:50.657 --> 01:48:53.821]  We urge you to warn everyone you know about this agenda.
[01:48:54.639 --> 01:48:55.580]  And it's the dominant agenda.
[01:48:55.620 --> 01:48:56.200]  It's in place.
[01:48:56.240 --> 01:48:57.281]  It's being executed.
[01:48:57.622 --> 01:49:11.094]  And to stand up in unison to resist the first great assault on human liberty in the 21st century, which is now certain to be inflicted upon us under the guise of saving Mother Earth, while the globalists butcher it with all their genetic engineering.
[01:49:11.494 --> 01:49:19.762]  We either stop this now, or we end up on the eco-ghettos and the masters have readied for us in their planned opulence.
[01:49:24.892 --> 01:49:26.372]  What do I say in the film, Endgame?
[01:49:28.553 --> 01:49:29.233]  What do I have?
[01:49:29.293 --> 01:49:33.755]  It's an image of the UN building with a big skull on it with all the flags of the countries removed.
[01:49:34.135 --> 01:49:35.355]  And on the back, what does it say?
[01:49:35.735 --> 01:49:36.095]  They.
[01:49:36.336 --> 01:49:36.676]  Want.
[01:49:36.896 --> 01:49:37.216]  You.
[01:49:37.476 --> 01:49:37.896]  Dead.
[01:49:38.356 --> 01:49:38.716]  They.
[01:49:38.936 --> 01:49:39.256]  Want.
[01:49:39.516 --> 01:49:39.797]  You.
[01:49:40.057 --> 01:49:40.497]  Dead.
[01:49:40.997 --> 01:49:45.638]  And these crooks sit there and lie and say there were no death panels when they've been in place in Europe for decades.
[01:49:48.339 --> 01:49:53.961]  They tell these idiot yuppies, uh... Bill Gates gets up,
[01:49:55.230 --> 01:49:56.492]  We're going to play that clip after the break.
[01:49:57.393 --> 01:50:05.124]  Bill Gates gets up on television and says, do we hire 10 teachers or lay them off, or do we not give grandma care?
[01:50:05.505 --> 01:50:09.671]  And then the people hearing that, the dumb 30-year-old teachers, they think, well, yeah, kill granny, I want money.
[01:50:10.802 --> 01:50:13.203]  As if it's not an endless pie that just expands.
[01:50:13.463 --> 01:50:16.503]  The first thing they teach collectivists is that the pie is a sunset game.
[01:50:16.803 --> 01:50:18.764]  So that somebody's got to lose for you to win.
[01:50:19.064 --> 01:50:21.184]  Not win, win, win, win, win, go to the stars.
[01:50:21.565 --> 01:50:27.866]  They produce videos for children saying leaving Earth is a scourge, humans are a disease, we mustn't leave.
[01:50:28.706 --> 01:50:29.947]  Teaching you you're worthless.
[01:50:29.967 --> 01:50:32.727]  But what do I say here on the back of Endgame?
[01:50:33.047 --> 01:50:36.028]  For the New World Order, a world government, is just the beginning.
[01:50:37.580 --> 01:50:45.425]  Once in place, they can engage their plan to exterminate 80% of the world's population, while enabling the elites to live forever with the aid of advanced technology.
[01:50:47.367 --> 01:50:49.828]  This film was shocking three years ago, four years ago.
[01:50:49.848 --> 01:50:52.330]  It is now prescient.
[01:50:53.391 --> 01:50:54.572]  Because I read their own documents.
[01:50:54.812 --> 01:50:56.833]  People are now ready to see Endgame.
[01:50:56.853 --> 01:50:58.214]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:58.334 --> 01:50:59.015]  Stay with us.
[01:50:59.455 --> 01:51:00.255]  Pure water.
[01:51:00.576 --> 01:51:03.037]  What could be better than the gift of health for your loved ones?
[01:51:03.277 --> 01:51:04.078]  And who better to help you?
[01:51:07.028 --> 01:51:07.449]  We're good.
[01:51:12.142 --> 01:51:16.364]  Chances are that water is contaminated with rust, bacteria, chlorine, and fluoride.
[01:51:16.584 --> 01:51:26.830]  For just pennies a day, Berkey water filters remove dangerous contaminants from both well and city water, is powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water, and is great for camping and emergencies.
[01:51:27.150 --> 01:51:32.653]  Right now, GCN listeners get 5% off all ceramic filter systems and free shipping on orders over $50.
[01:51:33.774 --> 01:51:40.918]  Purchase any filter system from BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com to get your choice of Berkey sport bottles, a KDF shower filter, a set of
[01:51:41.078 --> 01:51:41.658]  We're good to go.
[01:51:59.161 --> 01:52:00.422]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:00.462 --> 01:52:05.806]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:06.047 --> 01:52:10.670]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:11.071 --> 01:52:16.135]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:52:16.635 --> 01:52:18.477]  So our friends at Solutions from Science
[01:52:18.737 --> 01:52:19.237]  We're good to go.
[01:52:36.770 --> 01:52:39.612]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:52:39.952 --> 01:52:41.853]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.

[01:52:45.435 --> 01:52:47.436]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:52:48.196 --> 01:52:55.500]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:55.820 --> 01:52:58.281]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:52:58.781 --> 01:53:00.382]  Normal blood pressure, naturally.
[01:53:00.542 --> 01:53:01.643]  How would that make you feel?
[01:53:01.903 --> 01:53:03.244]  I'm Don from New Mexico.
[01:53:03.584 --> 01:53:05.885]  January of 2000, I had a heart attack.
[01:53:06.145 --> 01:53:13.429]  Then my real health began going downhill, and I had high blood pressure, high blood sugar, poor vision, and I really wasn't sleeping well.
[01:53:13.689 --> 01:53:15.049]  I was a mess, pretty much.
[01:53:16.090 --> 01:53:22.993]  I started taking heart and body extract, and from within a few days, I started sleeping a lot better.
[01:53:23.254 --> 01:53:28.316]  My blood pressure normalized, my blood sugar normalized, and my sleep really did improve.
[01:53:28.476 --> 01:53:33.359]  Experience these benefits and more when your body gets what it needs with the assistance of Heart and Body Extract.
[01:53:33.579 --> 01:53:37.621]  Order at HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305.
[01:53:38.001 --> 01:53:42.163]  That's HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305.
[01:53:42.703 --> 01:53:46.045]  Folks, I did not expect this at all.
[01:53:46.085 --> 01:53:50.747]  By the 7th, 8th, and 9th day, I saw dramatic improvements from taking Heart and Body Extract.
[01:53:50.787 --> 01:53:54.629]  Details at HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305 for Heart and Body Extract.
[01:54:06.754 --> 01:54:13.218]  I know it's pretty scary what I'm covering, but it's a fact.
[01:54:13.338 --> 01:54:16.800]  And remember how nuts I sounded just a few years ago covering this?
[01:54:16.840 --> 01:54:31.387]  Because I was reading UN reports and Club of Rome and CFR, where they were admitting geoengineering, global population reductions, face scanning cameras, infrared satellites, tracking our individual infrared signatures.
[01:54:32.128 --> 01:54:32.328]  Now,
[01:54:34.650 --> 01:54:36.671]  And I'm going to get into this next hour with Alan Watt.
[01:54:37.952 --> 01:54:43.416]  It's just, oh yeah, you know, Associated Press, Germany deploying secret spy satellites.
[01:54:44.417 --> 01:54:48.440]  They claimed it was for the environment, but really it's infrared images scanning your body.
[01:54:50.401 --> 01:54:54.144]  Detroit public schools give 40,000 kids laptops with stimulus funds.
[01:54:54.484 --> 01:54:57.506]  Of course, the laptops will be used to watch you at home.
[01:54:57.986 --> 01:54:59.267]  Now it's just, yeah, we do that.
[01:54:59.968 --> 01:55:00.989]  Here's the New York Times.
[01:55:01.089 --> 01:55:02.229]  Incredible article.
[01:55:02.650 --> 01:55:04.231]  Computers that see what you keep.
[01:55:06.601 --> 01:55:09.544]  Computers that see you and keep watch over you.
[01:55:10.165 --> 01:55:12.768]  Computers that see you and keep watch over you.
[01:55:13.449 --> 01:55:21.158]  And then it goes on to say, computers not to surveil you, but AI computers designed by DARPA to make sure you washed your hands right.
[01:55:22.199 --> 01:55:27.205]  To make sure you're feeding your kid, to make sure you're not giving your kid tea that's too hot.
[01:55:28.595 --> 01:55:29.736]  I mean, they actually say it!
[01:55:30.877 --> 01:55:31.438]  Everything!
[01:55:31.518 --> 01:55:32.179]  It's going in!
[01:55:32.239 --> 01:55:36.003]  Smart meters are going in Austin, where I live, to control your thermostats!
[01:55:36.504 --> 01:55:37.545]  I mean, and they admit it!
[01:55:37.625 --> 01:55:38.906]  I mean, it's just total control!
[01:55:38.946 --> 01:55:39.767]  They're just doing it!
[01:55:41.189 --> 01:55:43.852]  Federalization, CIA runs spy centers!
[01:55:45.014 --> 01:55:47.575]  And it's run by a government caught staging terror attacks!
[01:55:48.136 --> 01:55:59.502]  And then they put ads out and say we're extreme for not liking this message that children will be murdered, that's the message shown to school kids, if they don't submit to the carbon tax.
[01:55:59.542 --> 01:56:00.162]  That's the message.
[01:56:00.422 --> 01:56:01.343]  We will kill you!
[01:56:02.003 --> 01:56:03.985]  But then in the endgame, it is to kill them!
[01:56:04.445 --> 01:56:13.072]  They're teaching that it's like a bloodthirsty fetish, that it's a power trip of all these throngs of enviro-zombies that couldn't get a job, couldn't build anything.
[01:56:13.372 --> 01:56:18.276]  Just lazy people, who will now be the eco-fascist, green-cop enforcers.
[01:56:18.957 --> 01:56:22.479]  Let's go ahead and play the club of murdering children, and they show this to school kids.
[01:56:22.499 --> 01:56:22.860]  Here it is.
[01:56:23.976 --> 01:56:28.318]  Right, kids, just before you go, there's a brilliant idea in the air that I'd like to run by you.
[01:56:28.818 --> 01:56:29.719]  Now, it's called 10-10.
[01:56:29.959 --> 01:56:34.781]  The idea is everyone starts cutting their carbon emissions by 10%.
[01:56:34.961 --> 01:56:39.443]  Thus, keeping the planet safe for everyone, eventually.
[01:56:39.763 --> 01:56:46.406]  Now, this hasn't got to be a huge thing, but I would love it if you and your families would think about doing something.
[01:56:46.566 --> 01:56:47.487]  What sort of thing, miss?
[01:56:48.032 --> 01:56:54.575]  More like getting your dad to insulate the loft, or taking your next holiday by train.
[01:56:54.595 --> 01:57:01.077]  See, after they set the precedent with the reasonable sounding things, then it's... We're thinking of using our car less.
[01:57:01.237 --> 01:57:02.338]  I'm going to cycle school.
[01:57:02.618 --> 01:57:04.618]  See, we're thinking, but then it's law.
[01:57:04.678 --> 01:57:10.261]  Now, no pressure at all, but it'd be great to get a sense of how many of you... And in viral surveillance.
[01:57:10.641 --> 01:57:11.661]  That's fantastic!
[01:57:12.061 --> 01:57:13.682]  No pressure at all, but she's about to kill him.
[01:57:16.377 --> 01:57:17.258]  Philip and Tracy.
[01:57:17.838 --> 01:57:18.339]  You're dead.
[01:57:18.419 --> 01:57:19.459]  Fine, that's absolutely fine.
[01:57:19.660 --> 01:57:20.240]  Your own choice.
[01:57:20.881 --> 01:57:25.024]  Okay class, thank you so much for today, and I will see you all tomorrow.
[01:57:25.524 --> 01:57:25.644]  Oh!
[01:57:26.185 --> 01:57:32.129]  Just before you go, I just need to press this little button here.
[01:57:36.294 --> 01:57:40.596]  Now everybody, please remember to read chapters 5 and 6.
[01:57:40.656 --> 01:57:42.556]  The murdering continues for another 3 minutes.
[01:57:42.576 --> 01:57:43.597]  We don't have time to play it all.
[01:57:44.037 --> 01:57:46.518]  But the issue here is, this was government funded.
[01:57:47.918 --> 01:57:51.120]  Now, it's got so many layers of propaganda.
[01:57:51.160 --> 01:57:52.440]  It's like a 50 layer cake.
[01:57:53.080 --> 01:57:55.021]  But, it's peer pressure for kids.
[01:57:55.061 --> 01:57:59.903]  The message is, you'll be murdered by your authority figure teacher if you don't submit to this.
[01:58:02.784 --> 01:58:05.285]  And, it brutalizes the mind.
[01:58:06.403 --> 01:58:09.407]  And it teaches you that murdering is good if it's state run.
[01:58:11.550 --> 01:58:12.552]  And this is all their plan.
[01:58:15.083 --> 01:58:21.265]  And when you run into these weird glazed-eyed biological androids who are into this, they'll go, that's right, we are gonna do that.
[01:58:21.325 --> 01:58:30.387]  They giggle like they're part of it as they drink a glass of water at the restaurant filled with sodium fluoride and hundreds of other deadly chemicals on record, put in there to hurt them.
[01:58:30.887 --> 01:58:33.288]  And even if they admit it, they kind of get off on it.
[01:58:33.528 --> 01:58:35.888]  So to all of you, go ahead, you kill yourselves first.
[01:58:36.208 --> 01:58:37.929]  Not me and my kids, you understand, trash?
[01:58:39.278 --> 01:58:44.269]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[01:58:45.291 --> 01:58:48.097]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:49.158 --> 01:58:53.381]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:58:53.701 --> 01:58:54.322]  Number one.
[01:58:54.622 --> 01:58:57.764]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:58:58.045 --> 01:58:58.625]  Number two.
[01:58:58.905 --> 01:59:03.469]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:03.789 --> 01:59:04.249]  It's true.
[01:59:04.529 --> 01:59:09.093]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:09.413 --> 01:59:09.953]  Number three.
[01:59:10.234 --> 01:59:13.516]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:59:13.816 --> 01:59:17.519]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:59:17.719 --> 01:59:18.279]  Number four.
[01:59:18.519 --> 01:59:20.880]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:59:21.280 --> 01:59:24.661]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:59:24.961 --> 01:59:25.502]  Number five.
[01:59:25.742 --> 01:59:29.663]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:59:29.903 --> 01:59:34.664]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:59:34.945 --> 01:59:38.966]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:39.126 --> 01:59:40.666]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:40.906 --> 01:59:45.508]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[01:59:45.828 --> 01:59:47.130]  877-327-0365 Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:47.271 --> 01:59:53.101]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:03.942 --> 02:00:04.562]  Big Brother.
[02:00:05.242 --> 02:00:06.283]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:07.003 --> 02:00:08.143]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:08.764 --> 02:00:09.584]  You want answers?
[02:00:10.344 --> 02:00:11.164]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:11.885 --> 02:00:15.466]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.086 --> 02:00:20.207]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:20.887 --> 02:00:25.609]  You see, the globalists have to teach you through psychological warfare that dying is cool.
[02:00:26.289 --> 02:00:28.610]  That hating yourself is stylish.
[02:00:30.165 --> 02:00:39.149]  I mean, if they can make women dress more clownishly each year after the other because it's the style, well, they just tell you it's the style to hate yourself and not have a survival instinct.
[02:00:39.469 --> 02:00:45.851]  They lie to you and don't tell you that the entire West is dying with a 1.3 on average replacement rate.
[02:00:46.211 --> 02:00:47.172]  Places like Singapore, 1.2.
[02:00:47.212 --> 02:00:49.933]  For every two adults, they're having 1.2 children.
[02:00:50.765 --> 02:00:55.427]  They don't tell you the Earth's going to plane out at around 8,300,000,000 in 2020.
[02:00:55.487 --> 02:00:57.148]  That's the UN's own numbers.
[02:00:57.168 --> 02:00:57.968]  It'll probably be less.
[02:00:58.768 --> 02:01:05.591]  They don't tell you that when you fly in an aircraft, you notice that humans congregate in compact cities already naturally because of commerce.
[02:01:06.852 --> 02:01:12.074]  They don't tell you that if they just industrialized the third world, there wouldn't be an overpopulation issue.
[02:01:13.257 --> 02:01:15.038]  They don't care about toxic technologies.
[02:01:15.058 --> 02:01:16.660]  They don't care about real environmental threats.
[02:01:16.920 --> 02:01:22.865]  They care about collectivizing everything and getting control of your life and then euthanizing your butt.
[02:01:23.805 --> 02:01:25.427]  Controlling how many kids you can have.
[02:01:25.767 --> 02:01:28.149]  And this is their stated admission!
[02:01:29.636 --> 02:01:38.148]  I mean, reading Watson's article, you go through it and link to all the mainstream articles, where they're exposing themselves, saying, I love fascism, kill everyone, humans are a disease.
[02:01:38.409 --> 02:01:45.318]  These are hateful scum who can only operate inside of academia and that are funded by the mega-rich.
[02:01:46.735 --> 02:01:50.718]  Dr. Eric Pionka, I know the airborne Ebola is coming soon.
[02:01:50.738 --> 02:01:52.239]  It will kill 99% of us.
[02:01:52.779 --> 02:01:55.681]  I'm kind of sad my wife and children are ready to die, but we're all ready.
[02:01:56.022 --> 02:01:59.044]  It'll be here soon in the biology department.
[02:01:59.624 --> 02:02:07.550]  Then I get threatening emails over the years from his graduate students, and they'll say, here's my paper on it, graduate student 10 years ago.
[02:02:08.250 --> 02:02:12.033]  And then you search the woman's name or the man's name, and they're all in bioweapons.
[02:02:12.553 --> 02:02:15.936]  They're all working for the government in lab coats with crazed eyes.
[02:02:17.708 --> 02:02:18.929]  They just get off on it.
[02:02:18.949 --> 02:02:22.390]  They're just like demons flapping around a flame of destruction.
[02:02:22.410 --> 02:02:26.092]  You know, they just love the entire system.
[02:02:26.132 --> 02:02:26.912]  They love it.
[02:02:27.372 --> 02:02:29.133]  They love thinking about killing people.
[02:02:29.193 --> 02:02:30.874]  It's real sexy and cool.
[02:02:32.551 --> 02:02:35.472]  In fact, the other night Rob was showing me on Netflix up here on his computer.
[02:02:35.492 --> 02:02:37.292]  I think it's called Afterlife.
[02:02:37.793 --> 02:02:38.713]  Call Jacobson in here.
[02:02:38.733 --> 02:02:41.014]  Oh, he roves around the building talking to people.
[02:02:41.054 --> 02:02:41.694]  You call him in here.
[02:02:42.634 --> 02:02:44.655]  Because, or he may be on the phone with Watson right now.
[02:02:44.675 --> 02:02:45.435]  I forget the name of the movie.
[02:02:45.475 --> 02:02:48.636]  It's Nielsen, Leslie Nielsen or whatever his name is.
[02:02:48.936 --> 02:02:59.279]  It's all how sexy it is to die and how fun and humans are all trash and scum and it's best that most of us die because most people are already dead right now.
[02:02:59.799 --> 02:03:02.160]  Most people already deserve it and it's wonderful.
[02:03:04.224 --> 02:03:14.809]  I mean, these people are so abhorrent, so against all common sense of all cultures that came before us, but they're telling us that everything's good, that everything is good, that everything that is wholesome.
[02:03:15.429 --> 02:03:15.929]  Come on in, Rob.
[02:03:15.949 --> 02:03:17.029]  Did they tell you I needed you to come on in?
[02:03:17.050 --> 02:03:21.772]  What was the name of that movie you watched and you had me watch 10 minutes of the other night?
[02:03:21.792 --> 02:03:22.732]  It was called Afterlife.
[02:03:22.832 --> 02:03:24.833]  It was called Afterlife, and you liked the girl in it.
[02:03:24.873 --> 02:03:25.293]  What's her name?
[02:03:26.554 --> 02:03:27.154]  Christina Ricci.
[02:03:27.637 --> 02:03:32.941]  Christina Ricci and then uh... and and and and and uh... Lesley Neal, Liam Neeson.
[02:03:33.001 --> 02:03:34.522]  Liam Neeson, Liam Neeson.
[02:03:34.802 --> 02:03:36.023]  Yeah, and I watched like ten minutes of it.
[02:03:36.043 --> 02:03:36.743]  You showed me the clips.
[02:03:36.784 --> 02:03:44.029]  It's all how we're all scum and eugenics is good and dying is wonderful and it's all sexy to be in a coffin and oh, it's so good.
[02:03:44.049 --> 02:03:45.250]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:03:45.610 --> 02:03:48.192]  Really glamorizing death and how death is uh...
[02:03:48.888 --> 02:03:51.489]  You know, oh, I'm so happy to be finally dead.
[02:03:51.569 --> 02:03:52.889]  Life wasn't good anymore.
[02:03:53.049 --> 02:03:58.171]  And they teach death education in the junior highs and wonder why the little girls are committing suicide at record numbers.
[02:03:58.211 --> 02:04:00.692]  And they know Prozac massively increases suicide.
[02:04:00.752 --> 02:04:02.372]  And they say, oh, more Prozac.
[02:04:02.592 --> 02:04:04.033]  And then there's more suicide.
[02:04:04.073 --> 02:04:05.733]  And, you know, I've got daughters.
[02:04:05.773 --> 02:04:06.433]  I've got a son.
[02:04:06.493 --> 02:04:07.594]  I'm tired of this evil.
[02:04:07.634 --> 02:04:11.115]  I'm tired of them teaching them death is good so that they will submit to tyranny.
[02:04:11.315 --> 02:04:12.535]  I'm sick of these sickos.
[02:04:12.735 --> 02:04:14.936]  And it's time for good people to defeat them.
[02:04:15.674 --> 02:04:21.698]  This movie was really frightening and how convincing it could be for talking somebody into committing suicide.
[02:04:21.758 --> 02:04:22.438]  It was really dark.
[02:04:22.458 --> 02:04:23.739]  Well, that's why suicide goes up and up.
[02:04:23.759 --> 02:04:25.260]  They teach you how great it is.
[02:04:25.420 --> 02:04:27.181]  Oh, little girls don't commit suicide.
[02:04:27.481 --> 02:04:30.263]  Now we're going to have weeks and weeks of classes how you do it.
[02:04:31.083 --> 02:04:32.324]  And then it just goes off the chart.
[02:04:32.845 --> 02:04:33.885]  It introduces them an idea.
[02:04:34.225 --> 02:04:36.167]  Oh, you're a little depressed over zits on your face?
[02:04:36.607 --> 02:04:38.708]  Here's Prozac, known to cause suicide.
[02:04:38.948 --> 02:04:40.369]  Now we're going to teach you how to commit suicide.
[02:04:40.589 --> 02:04:41.290]  But don't do it.
[02:04:44.072 --> 02:04:47.315]  And the mindless teacher compartmentalized doesn't even know what they're doing.
[02:04:47.515 --> 02:04:49.577]  They're teaching children how to kill themselves.
[02:04:49.798 --> 02:04:51.559]  This is the mastery of the New World Order.
[02:04:51.820 --> 02:04:53.481]  Teaching you that death is life.
[02:04:54.362 --> 02:04:56.564]  That slavery is freedom.
[02:04:56.584 --> 02:04:58.006]  We'll be right back with Alan Watts.
[02:04:58.026 --> 02:04:58.466]  Stay with us.
[02:04:59.207 --> 02:05:02.910]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.

[02:05:12.437 --> 02:05:17.201]  Not looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[02:05:17.962 --> 02:05:24.987]  Not worried about them moving south, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[02:05:27.883 --> 02:05:35.129]  We're American and be proud.
[02:05:35.229 --> 02:05:37.591]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.

[02:05:59.602 --> 02:06:02.223]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:06:02.623 --> 02:06:07.584]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:06:07.944 --> 02:06:09.685]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:06:09.985 --> 02:06:14.806]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:06:14.986 --> 02:06:15.967]  How much do you want?
[02:06:16.167 --> 02:06:16.927]  When do you want it?
[02:06:17.307 --> 02:06:18.908]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:06:19.188 --> 02:06:20.008]  When will you need it?
[02:06:20.248 --> 02:06:22.309]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:06:22.469 --> 02:06:23.449]  Will there be any food?
[02:06:23.789 --> 02:06:25.130]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:06:25.310 --> 02:06:30.393]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:06:30.594 --> 02:06:33.756]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:06:34.176 --> 02:06:37.678]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:06:37.999 --> 02:06:38.979]  How much will you need?
[02:06:39.219 --> 02:06:39.840]  We don't know.
[02:06:40.120 --> 02:06:41.041]  How much do you want?
[02:06:41.221 --> 02:06:41.961]  All you can get.
[02:06:42.161 --> 02:06:43.002]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:06:43.262 --> 02:06:46.024]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:06:46.304 --> 02:06:48.065]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:06:53.829 --> 02:06:56.492]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:06:56.752 --> 02:06:59.775]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:06:59.815 --> 02:07:06.501]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:07:06.762 --> 02:07:09.044]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:07:09.304 --> 02:07:14.507]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:07:14.687 --> 02:07:17.469]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:07:17.729 --> 02:07:19.850]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:07:20.050 --> 02:07:25.974]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:07:26.294 --> 02:07:29.456]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:07:29.656 --> 02:07:35.198]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:07:35.438 --> 02:07:36.759]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:07:37.079 --> 02:07:38.300]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:07:38.380 --> 02:07:40.941]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:07:41.061 --> 02:07:45.122]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:07:45.283 --> 02:07:49.764]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:07:49.904 --> 02:07:52.346]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[02:07:52.506 --> 02:07:56.187]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:07:56.367 --> 02:07:57.368]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:08:04.059 --> 02:08:08.241]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:08:08.882 --> 02:08:09.682]  You want answers?
[02:08:10.463 --> 02:08:11.423]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:12.004 --> 02:08:15.606]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:16.206 --> 02:08:20.288]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:28.480 --> 02:08:38.048]  Well, Alan Watt is an amazing researcher, and he's also a radio talk show host, and we always find it very informative to have him on with us.
[02:08:38.648 --> 02:08:47.156]  He's on with us for five minutes in the next hour, then we have a top meteorologist on who's been accurately predicting these frozen wasteland ice age winters.
[02:08:47.836 --> 02:08:49.278]  And he's getting the credit that is due.
[02:08:49.699 --> 02:08:57.750]  But the last two hours, yeah, we've got birthers screaming during the reading of the Constitution that Obama isn't a natural born.
[02:08:57.790 --> 02:08:58.170]  We've got
[02:08:59.269 --> 02:09:10.513]  Drones coming to Miami-Dade County, and we've got the big announcements that they're building giant DARPA face scanning camera centers everywhere, and giant NSA databases.
[02:09:11.273 --> 02:09:15.875]  We've got announcements that the government's spying on all its employees right now with warrantless wiretaps.
[02:09:15.895 --> 02:09:22.457]  I mean, it's just, it's total evil being released as they try to break our will and condition us.
[02:09:22.497 --> 02:09:28.399]  But for the last two hours, I've been talking about Paul Joseph Watson's articles, eco-fascist call for prison cities,
[02:09:30.002 --> 02:09:36.921]  And the other article on the same similar subject, Plannedopolis, elitist agenda for eco-enslavement.
[02:09:36.961 --> 02:09:37.864]  Now, Alan Watt.
[02:09:38.897 --> 02:09:43.060]  I want to hear your expertise on this, but my basic boil-down is this.
[02:09:43.640 --> 02:09:46.922]  There is an attempt to rebrand dystopia as mother's milk.
[02:09:47.663 --> 02:09:52.026]  To show children being murdered by their teachers, and it being a good thing because they don't submit to the earth.
[02:09:52.566 --> 02:09:59.551]  Open announcements that we should just kill all people over 65, a Logan's Run carousel, London Guardian, you name it.
[02:09:59.631 --> 02:10:03.173]  I mean, they are saying we are Nazis, we are fascists.
[02:10:03.193 --> 02:10:05.475]  They are saying, yes, it's eugenics.
[02:10:06.956 --> 02:10:15.903]  They are just flaunting it, I guess to change the Overton window, to be so extreme that the sky is in the limit and somehow break our will.
[02:10:16.443 --> 02:10:24.490]  I believe it's backfiring on them, but we are doing the search terms today, prison cities, eco fascist, and prisonplanet.com.
[02:10:24.630 --> 02:10:30.014]  Eco cities is number one search, eco fascist number two search, prisonplanet.com number three search.
[02:10:30.074 --> 02:10:31.976]  Please make them all number one, number two, number three.
[02:10:32.216 --> 02:10:33.277]  Let's smash the enemy.
[02:10:33.517 --> 02:10:38.180]  You will decide which one is number one by how many times you put it into Google and then hit re-enter over and over again.
[02:10:38.720 --> 02:10:42.903]  But they are really coming out with the world government with just all of it.
[02:10:43.223 --> 02:10:49.787]  Is it because alternative media has checkmated them or brought them into check exposing their agenda and so stonewalling doesn't work?
[02:10:50.427 --> 02:10:57.592]  Or is it just simply to psychologically overwhelm us with the flaunting and it's all delivered in a gibbering
[02:10:58.212 --> 02:11:11.608]  Jiggling away by these psychopathic people engaged in this public orgy as they prepare for a mass bloodthirsty feast.
[02:11:12.269 --> 02:11:14.632]  Alan Watt, what is your take on them going into Warped Drive?
[02:11:14.652 --> 02:11:16.114]  Or do you agree they're going into Warped Drive?
[02:11:17.153 --> 02:11:20.856]  Oh, they are, but it's on plan as part of the agenda.
[02:11:21.497 --> 02:11:32.946]  They go by an educational timetable, and they go by five-year plans for children, who'll be five now, ten in a few years, and how they're going to perceive their new world.
[02:11:32.966 --> 02:11:38.971]  They're getting ready for it now, they're training them for it now to be quite normal, and so this is just the educational part.
[02:11:39.552 --> 02:11:41.594]  It's time to implement this stage of the agenda.
[02:11:42.154 --> 02:11:50.084]  They know exactly how much to push, of course, because they've already prepared us all for the present agenda, and we accept it.
[02:11:50.104 --> 02:11:57.234]  We're always prepared in advance for everything that comes along, mainly through little bits and bytes of information from scientific expos.
[02:11:57.814 --> 02:12:18.619]  On the media and we also get it through all fiction, all fiction has it in it now that the coming system you have to live into and for more 30 years now sci-fi has been pouring out this dystopic future with a small group elite running the world, a scientific elite of course, always a scientific elite,
[02:12:19.199 --> 02:12:19.620]  And China has!
[02:12:33.951 --> 02:12:39.695]  He actually has those closed cities for their worker drones who are even locked in their neighborhoods at night.
[02:12:40.015 --> 02:12:45.899]  Meanwhile, the globalists are doing everything they can to shut off the resources while telling us that it's naturally happening.
[02:12:45.919 --> 02:12:48.660]  But then we have all their own manuals admitting it.
[02:12:48.880 --> 02:12:49.501]  Please continue.
[02:12:50.339 --> 02:13:07.638]  Yeah, and it's all done by stages where they introduce new crisis, as crisis after crisis, and you think about life before 9-11 happened, it was fairly static to an extent, and no major changes, drastic changes, certainly not a whole bunch of them all at once.
[02:13:08.298 --> 02:13:13.405]  And since 9-11 it's been crisis after crisis after crisis, and this is the technique of a revolution.
[02:13:13.425 --> 02:13:14.987]  It's their revolution, not ours.
[02:13:15.568 --> 02:13:18.812]  And they're bringing the last phase into being.
[02:13:19.172 --> 02:13:21.335]  And this phase, of course, will last up to the year 2050 or so.
[02:13:23.337 --> 02:13:27.380]  As they drastically reduced the population again through food rationing.
[02:13:27.640 --> 02:13:32.203]  But this is not new because the United Nations was set up really to help coordinate all of this.
[02:13:32.243 --> 02:13:52.496]  You need a massive... Well, the British 200 years ago developed the reservation concentration camp model and then it was used on the Native Americans and then we have the British manuals that are in the Library of Congress, how to give them the smallpox blankets, how to open the wounds of the soldiers... Malthus put out lots of instruction booklets, educational booklets for the British Empire.
[02:13:52.976 --> 02:14:01.858]  How to run their colonies, how to keep peasants at a working level, but not too bright, too strong to walk off at night or run away.
[02:14:02.418 --> 02:14:04.698]  And so they had the whole diet scheme figured out.
[02:14:04.739 --> 02:14:06.639]  That's why diet is very important to it.
[02:14:07.159 --> 02:14:10.520]  And that's why rationing is coming in to help us get to that stage.
[02:14:10.860 --> 02:14:16.581]  Strong enough to be kind of pliable and workable, but not too smart enough to do anything about it.
[02:14:17.221 --> 02:14:18.701]  And this is all part of it too.
[02:14:19.102 --> 02:14:21.422]  So that was introduced into the British Commonwealth
[02:14:21.482 --> 02:14:36.954]  That's right, they have manuals on how omnivores are less aggressive when they're mainly on the vegetarian diet, but that we're designed and triggered under especially a red meat diet with the hormonal endocrine interfaces to become more predatory and aggressive.
[02:14:37.254 --> 02:14:38.475]  They don't want that for us.
[02:14:38.515 --> 02:14:43.879]  They want us docile, grass-eating creatures for them to more easily roll over us.
[02:14:44.740 --> 02:14:46.922]  Oh yeah, and they talked about bringing them to India.
[02:14:47.674 --> 02:15:05.664]  They talked an awful lot with the Brahmins, very interested in their culture, because the Brahmins had kept that very system working in India for thousands of years, and so the people were taught a religion that made them vegetarian, and you can also restrict, of course, even what you give them for a vegetarian, which makes them even more
[02:15:06.364 --> 02:15:08.285]  I'm pliable and not too bright.
[02:15:08.725 --> 02:15:10.506]  It's down to a perfect science.
[02:15:10.526 --> 02:15:13.447]  They know everything that you need to eat to keep you bright and healthy.
[02:15:13.528 --> 02:15:13.948]  That's right.
[02:15:13.988 --> 02:15:28.314]  The anthropology and archaeology and biology shows that the brain, CC wise, begins to grow even larger with even just a few generations on a red meat diet because it has the fats and oils needed for brain development.
[02:15:29.215 --> 02:15:31.436]  The British soldiers in World War One,
[02:15:33.019 --> 02:15:35.380]  They were never fed properly before they became soldiers.
[02:15:36.121 --> 02:15:42.443]  They came from all walks of life, generally the industrial towns and cities where meat was pretty expensive, very expensive and very scarce for them.
[02:15:43.244 --> 02:15:50.607]  And within the first, they found within the first, the average recruit was five foot three, by the way, at the age of 16, 17, 18.
[02:15:51.647 --> 02:15:58.270]  And within three months of getting a high protein and meat diet, he was between three and six inches.
[02:15:59.582 --> 02:16:00.626]  And that's how starved they were.
[02:16:01.047 --> 02:16:04.539]  So all this had been tested out on populations before, including Britain.
[02:16:05.191 --> 02:16:09.812]  And they had to give them meat though to get them ready to kill, because the Germans were gobbling meat and understood that.
[02:16:09.992 --> 02:16:10.993]  It's all scientific.
[02:16:11.333 --> 02:16:14.014]  So right now, they're really rushing all this out.
[02:16:14.074 --> 02:16:20.215]  It's been accelerating since the staged event of 9-11, but in the last year, it's like they put the afterburners on.
[02:16:20.275 --> 02:16:24.757]  I mean, they are just out in mainline news saying, we're going to kill you at 65.
[02:16:25.877 --> 02:16:27.557]  They're not even denying death panels now.
[02:16:27.598 --> 02:16:29.138]  They're saying, we're going to kill you.
[02:16:29.358 --> 02:16:30.558]  I mean, we are murderers.
[02:16:30.598 --> 02:16:32.379]  They are saying, we are murderers.
[02:16:32.939 --> 02:16:35.161]  Yeah, you've had write-ups in the British papers.
[02:16:35.221 --> 02:16:37.804]  Again, Britain is the flagship for the world to follow, remember?
[02:16:38.565 --> 02:16:42.048]  And they're talking about putting up euthanasia booths at street corners.
[02:16:42.689 --> 02:16:49.636]  Very much like you saw in Siren Queen, where you just get rolled into some classical... Or Children of Man, they're getting us all ready for the suicide.
[02:16:49.656 --> 02:16:50.837]  Mm-hmm, oh yeah.
[02:16:51.217 --> 02:16:54.321]  And so, yeah, it's a scientific dictatorship.
[02:16:55.261 --> 02:16:59.684]  This was all promoted by Bertrand Russell who helped set up the system we're living through now.
[02:16:59.744 --> 02:17:00.725]  He was a big promoter.
[02:17:01.105 --> 02:17:13.594]  He attended all the think tanks and put forward lots of ideas along with Aldous Huxley and his brother Julian Huxley from the United Nations UNESCO and they talked about, they had it all planned out for this phase that we're going through now.
[02:17:13.895 --> 02:17:22.801]  How the society would be turned into a society where there'd be very little marriage at all, massive promiscuity but very little births.
[02:17:23.468 --> 02:17:25.389]  And that was supposed to be encouraged.
[02:17:25.429 --> 02:17:26.350]  Of course, they've done that.
[02:17:26.370 --> 02:17:27.971]  They've been successful with all of that.
[02:17:28.632 --> 02:17:30.453]  And everyone's divided now.
[02:17:30.533 --> 02:17:32.794]  No one's got a family to stand up for them anymore.
[02:17:33.135 --> 02:17:34.435]  So government is the boss.
[02:17:34.996 --> 02:17:37.237]  And so now they can just rampage ahead with all the rest.
[02:17:37.257 --> 02:17:37.638]  That's right.
[02:17:37.678 --> 02:17:42.981]  That's why the Romans had to build that wall in central England because they could never conquer the Scots.
[02:17:43.341 --> 02:17:50.326]  The only group that they could never conquer because they were so family tribal oriented, kind of like Afghans, they would die before they did it.
[02:17:50.846 --> 02:17:53.148]  But now the Scots have been brought to heel quite nicely.
[02:17:54.228 --> 02:18:14.919]  Oh yeah, again through their diets, again they were ruled by London for a few hundred years, still are, and again too we've got to understand that the basic premise as well from all of this is how they pick the leaders of countries and those who are the politicians who are still lower level but they're higher level than people generally see
[02:18:15.652 --> 02:18:16.512]  I don't know.
[02:18:33.729 --> 02:18:39.773]  That means that you must attend every meeting when you're called, that could be three in the morning, whenever, to show you're very eager.
[02:18:39.793 --> 02:18:48.699]  And that's how they pick their future prime ministers, etc., and politicians, the ones who'll get up and be an operative mace and do what they're told, never ask why.
[02:18:49.419 --> 02:18:52.662]  And never ask the consequences of their actions.
[02:18:52.682 --> 02:19:03.612]  Yeah, all the modern presidents, prime ministers, MI5, MI6, CIA, Sarkozy in France, all of them, Vladimir Putin, they're just all secret society agents.
[02:19:04.353 --> 02:19:06.375]  Yes, and they must prove their worth.
[02:19:06.475 --> 02:19:07.456]  That's the whole case with it.
[02:19:07.796 --> 02:19:11.159]  They've got to be eager, they've got to show that they can go to parties and not get too drunk.
[02:19:11.699 --> 02:19:15.283]  They must not be loose-lipped, because they're monitored more than anyone else.
[02:19:15.925 --> 02:19:22.811]  You see, the system is based on the Soviet system and a hyper-Soviet system.
[02:19:23.652 --> 02:19:35.042]  They've announced in the declassified records of Russia that there was so many dossiers on all the bureaucrats working for the Soviet system, way more than the average person, the pro at the bottom.
[02:19:36.443 --> 02:19:48.309]  Because they have to make sure that those are the ones, just like George Orwell showed you in 1984, those are the ones who must be gung-ho and always put on the good face for the party, believe in the party, that kind of thing.
[02:19:48.630 --> 02:19:51.051]  And their telephone calls, everything was monitored.
[02:19:51.471 --> 02:19:53.692]  Stay there, we've had a bomb go off.
[02:19:54.093 --> 02:19:57.134]  We told you the feds were getting ready to start detonating those all over.
[02:19:57.614 --> 02:19:58.275]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:59.380 --> 02:20:03.603]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:20:03.923 --> 02:20:04.544]  Number one.
[02:20:04.844 --> 02:20:07.986]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:20:08.267 --> 02:20:08.847]  Number two.
[02:20:09.127 --> 02:20:13.671]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:20:14.031 --> 02:20:14.471]  It's true.
[02:20:14.771 --> 02:20:19.315]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:20:19.635 --> 02:20:20.175]  Number three.
[02:20:20.456 --> 02:20:23.738]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:20:24.038 --> 02:20:27.721]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:20:27.941 --> 02:20:28.501]  Number 4.
[02:20:28.742 --> 02:20:31.103]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:20:31.504 --> 02:20:34.886]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:20:35.187 --> 02:20:35.387]  Number 5.
[02:20:35.967 --> 02:20:39.890]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:20:40.130 --> 02:20:44.874]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:20:45.174 --> 02:20:49.201]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:20:49.341 --> 02:20:50.904]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:20:51.124 --> 02:20:53.228]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:20:53.388 --> 02:20:55.732]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:20:59.580 --> 02:21:03.724]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[02:21:03.764 --> 02:21:05.045]  dollar has been devaluating.
[02:21:05.205 --> 02:21:08.909]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[02:21:09.189 --> 02:21:11.731]  Is there a way to protect your portfolios from losing value?
[02:21:11.931 --> 02:21:13.753]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[02:21:13.913 --> 02:21:16.235]  They both have maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[02:21:17.236 --> 02:21:25.987]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them until now, your cash would have the buying power of only $4,800.
[02:21:26.268 --> 02:21:29.472]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[02:21:29.532 --> 02:21:32.616]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[02:21:32.816 --> 02:21:34.656]  Call John Ballman today at 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[02:21:34.736 --> 02:21:38.577]  Get all your questions answered before your money is worth a zero.
[02:21:38.597 --> 02:21:39.337]  Call 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[02:21:39.377 --> 02:21:41.418]  Take action today while we still accept paper dollars for gold.
[02:21:41.438 --> 02:21:42.018]  That's 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[02:21:58.976 --> 02:22:01.279]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:22:01.299 --> 02:22:03.582]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:22:03.682 --> 02:22:06.405]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:22:06.906 --> 02:22:11.651]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:22:11.992 --> 02:22:16.197]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:22:16.497 --> 02:22:18.841]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:22:18.861 --> 02:22:21.385]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:22:21.745 --> 02:22:24.309]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:22:24.649 --> 02:22:32.261]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:22:32.597 --> 02:22:37.880]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:22:37.960 --> 02:22:40.782]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:22:40.822 --> 02:22:44.264]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:22:44.524 --> 02:22:45.445]  And I got news for you.
[02:22:45.585 --> 02:22:46.886]  You're everyone else.
[02:22:46.926 --> 02:22:47.946]  Invisible Empire.

[02:22:57.912 --> 02:22:58.232]  Hello.
[02:22:58.573 --> 02:23:02.979]  At OfTheField.com, we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.
[02:23:03.320 --> 02:23:07.826]  We get lots of amazing positive feedback, most of which we feature on OfTheField.com.
[02:23:08.147 --> 02:23:12.934]  Here's a small sample of all that people like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[02:23:13.274 --> 02:23:17.216]  It's inspiring for many who are affected by the recent downturn of the economy.
[02:23:17.376 --> 02:23:21.299]  I already knew a bit about foraging and edibles, but you take it to a whole new level.
[02:23:21.419 --> 02:23:23.940]  A thousand thanks to you for all that great knowledge.
[02:23:24.220 --> 02:23:25.121]  It was empowering.
[02:23:25.241 --> 02:23:29.143]  When I was in the Navy, I went through a couple of quick land survival classes.
[02:23:29.243 --> 02:23:32.025]  Thank you for being an inspiration and for all the work that you do.
[02:23:32.045 --> 02:23:34.786]  I really appreciate the depth and detail of the information.
[02:23:34.907 --> 02:23:35.727]  Thank you so much.
[02:23:35.907 --> 02:23:38.669]  Much love and respect to you from all of us here in the boonies.
[02:23:38.749 --> 02:23:39.309]  Thanks again.
[02:23:39.489 --> 02:23:42.111]  Knowledge is power, and that power brings peace.
[02:23:42.853 --> 02:23:45.877]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.
[02:23:46.278 --> 02:23:49.662]  Read all of the testimonials at ofthefield.com.
[02:23:49.862 --> 02:23:53.867]  You can order online for you and your loved ones, or call 1-888-51-EAT-FREE to share in the secret.
[02:24:05.199 --> 02:24:14.708]  So the naked body scanners go in 9,000 locations getting telescreens at Walmart and malls with Janet Napolitano and government messages about spying on your neighbors.
[02:24:15.328 --> 02:24:21.935]  The last six years they've trained local police in every county and city that domestic non-Al Qaeda will start blowing up.
[02:24:22.495 --> 02:24:23.876]  the courthouses everywhere.
[02:24:24.617 --> 02:24:25.898]  And then magically it happens!
[02:24:26.498 --> 02:24:37.347]  And I was watching Body of Lies with Russell Crowe and Leonardo DiCaprio this morning while I was jogging on the treadmill, and it was all about the near future Muslims blowing up soft targets.
[02:24:37.367 --> 02:24:41.190]  So the answer is, they've said, shopping malls, streets, checkpoints.
[02:24:41.250 --> 02:24:42.832]  Notice the government's like, we're getting ready.
[02:24:42.852 --> 02:24:45.374]  And then in every case it's linked to the government.
[02:24:46.294 --> 02:24:46.895]  Directly?
[02:24:46.915 --> 02:24:48.456]  They're like, never mind about that.
[02:24:48.796 --> 02:24:51.338]  We're taking over right as the depression comes in.
[02:24:51.839 --> 02:24:53.540]  Right as the implosion comes in.
[02:24:54.361 --> 02:24:55.102]  And here's the news.
[02:24:55.122 --> 02:24:57.424]  We'll get Alan Watts' take on it in real time here.
[02:24:59.019 --> 02:25:02.541]  That's how I knew they were going to blow up the World Trade Center months before.
[02:25:02.581 --> 02:25:06.043]  They were getting everybody ready and saying, when the attack comes, give your rights up.
[02:25:06.103 --> 02:25:08.704]  It's like a Jim Jones Kool-Aid drinking drill.
[02:25:09.164 --> 02:25:12.266]  Bomb squad at a building near State House after a mailroom employee injured.
[02:25:12.626 --> 02:25:16.488]  State FBI officials, not servants, officials, called the scene.
[02:25:16.988 --> 02:25:19.970]  Second explosion reported at Hanover office.
[02:25:20.010 --> 02:25:22.431]  So we got it in Baltimore and Annapolis, correct guys?
[02:25:23.272 --> 02:25:26.053]  The Maryland State House mailroom employee was injured Thursday.
[02:25:27.754 --> 02:25:33.476]  Afternoon, while handling a package, an incident was being investigated by bomb squad according to Annapolis City officials.
[02:25:33.776 --> 02:25:40.677]  Annapolis Fire Department's bomb squad was investigating the incident, and the state's bomb squad and FBI officials were on their way to the Jeffrey Building on St.
[02:25:40.737 --> 02:25:42.938]  Francis Street where the incident took place.
[02:25:42.958 --> 02:25:44.859]  Again, this is just now breaking.
[02:25:45.759 --> 02:25:49.840]  Continuing, a fire crew's hazmat sent to MDOT
[02:25:50.600 --> 02:25:50.740]  I think?
[02:26:09.946 --> 02:26:21.809]  Hispanic, black, white, prison converts to Islam, converted by feds, to blow up Christmas trees and things, and even the mainstream media has called it set-ups, entrapment, but they're out there finding mentally ill morons.
[02:26:22.169 --> 02:26:26.870]  In a matter of days, I could find a homeless schizophrenic and get him to blow something up, hypothetically, if I wanted to.
[02:26:26.890 --> 02:26:27.710]  I mean, it's not hard.
[02:26:27.730 --> 02:26:29.111]  Give him whiskey and drugs and money.
[02:26:29.851 --> 02:26:30.331]  They'll do it.
[02:26:30.831 --> 02:26:31.833]  It's the same old story.
[02:26:32.093 --> 02:26:37.240]  But obviously that wasn't working enough, so they may have gotten an actual lunatic to do this, or they may have done it themselves.
[02:26:37.981 --> 02:26:41.025]  Let's get Alan Watts' take on all of this as it unfolds.
[02:26:41.286 --> 02:26:46.793]  We do have a man-arrested Maryland terror bomb plot, and this was back in the 8th of December.
[02:26:47.975 --> 02:26:48.576]  Here's another one.
[02:26:48.636 --> 02:26:51.618]  Lawyer, FBI entrapped Baltimore bomb plot suspect.
[02:26:51.958 --> 02:26:56.642]  No way Antonio Martinez could have assembled the phony bomb and tended to blow up recruitment centers.
[02:26:56.982 --> 02:26:59.484]  So we got a major operation already going in Maryland.
[02:27:00.064 --> 02:27:02.066]  Allen Watt, what's your take on this situation?
[02:27:03.174 --> 02:27:04.975]  You're quite right, they can find whoever they want.
[02:27:05.055 --> 02:27:18.085]  In fact, right after 9-11, the BBC had the top guy on from MI5 who was saying that if they keep putting up sites and putting up their own agents there to entice youngsters into these sites,
[02:27:18.900 --> 02:27:26.623]  Uh, to carry out bombs for sting operations, they'll end up creating an actual organization, Al-Qaeda, which did not exist before.
[02:27:26.683 --> 02:27:34.746]  Yeah, just like they can get kids to join the military and have their heads shaved and be brainwashed, the government posing with recruiters can recruit people to radical Islam.
[02:27:35.825 --> 02:27:41.268]  Absolutely too, and most of them are actually sting operations, and they supply the fake bombs.
[02:27:41.688 --> 02:27:51.374]  They get a bunch of youngsters there who've watched too many video games, and they're in on the plot, and they're caught red-handed with the goods, and they're arrested.
[02:27:51.414 --> 02:27:56.077]  So, see, if you change the world into a war scenario, and this is the whole thing since 9-11,
[02:27:57.359 --> 02:28:04.882]  I said at the time, I said you're going to see rationing down the road, all the things that you've seen, warfare, even eventually refugees getting moved from one area to another.
[02:28:05.883 --> 02:28:08.784]  That will happen because they must get an actual, all the things that worked.
[02:28:08.884 --> 02:28:14.727]  And that was in the UN report from Mexico last month, is that they are going to force move people for the earth.
[02:28:15.427 --> 02:28:15.647]  Mm-hmm.
[02:28:16.168 --> 02:28:24.595]  And that is all part of it, a true war scenario, because they know the psychological impacts of all these things, how it has on the general populations.
[02:28:24.896 --> 02:28:28.279]  They buckle under even more to do what they're told during these scenarios.
[02:28:28.579 --> 02:28:36.546]  They're terrified, and they ram whole bunches of new laws down their throats, and there's no objection from the people who are terrified.
[02:28:36.946 --> 02:28:38.107]  That's what they must do now.
[02:28:38.127 --> 02:28:45.351]  And of course, that's what the whole ecological movement is to, sustainability, so on, global warming, all this nonsense.
[02:28:45.932 --> 02:28:50.554]  It's an excuse to bring all of this on into the controlled, scientifically controlled society.
[02:28:51.155 --> 02:28:53.636]  And remember, Russell said that this will come.
[02:28:53.776 --> 02:28:57.719]  They were working towards it back in the 30s, 40s, and the 50s.
[02:28:58.239 --> 02:28:59.340]  And he says that this will come.
[02:28:59.880 --> 02:29:04.103]  And he said when it comes in, it will be a dictatorial and absolutely
[02:29:05.243 --> 02:29:08.385]  Um, tyrannical system, but that's what I prefer, he said.
[02:29:08.405 --> 02:29:11.727]  It would have to be utterly tyrannical as a scientific dictatorship.
[02:29:12.307 --> 02:29:15.509]  So that's what we're going to see getting put... I mean, it's all through the schools.
[02:29:16.189 --> 02:29:23.754]  For the last 15 to 20 years, the children have been taught to be greenies, taught that government is good, taught that they must share their food with the whole world.
[02:29:24.174 --> 02:29:25.955]  And in reality, it's nothing to do with that.
[02:29:26.255 --> 02:29:30.698]  The United Nations Department of Agriculture was set up with the task when it was created
[02:29:31.398 --> 02:29:34.340]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:34.360 --> 02:29:36.521]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:30:58.592 --> 02:31:02.835]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:03.155 --> 02:31:03.416]  Number 1.
[02:31:04.056 --> 02:31:07.198]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:07.479 --> 02:31:08.039]  Number 2.
[02:31:08.359 --> 02:31:12.903]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:13.243 --> 02:31:13.683]  It's true.
[02:31:13.983 --> 02:31:18.547]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:18.847 --> 02:31:19.387]  Number 3.
[02:31:19.688 --> 02:31:22.970]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:23.270 --> 02:31:26.973]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:27.173 --> 02:31:27.714]  Number 4.
[02:31:27.954 --> 02:31:30.336]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:30.716 --> 02:31:34.120]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:34.400 --> 02:31:34.940]  Number 5.
[02:31:35.201 --> 02:31:39.124]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:31:39.344 --> 02:31:44.109]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:31:44.389 --> 02:31:48.413]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:48.553 --> 02:31:50.135]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:31:59.668 --> 02:32:03.292]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:32:03.692 --> 02:32:06.696]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:32:06.936 --> 02:32:11.701]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:32:11.721 --> 02:32:17.968]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:32:18.128 --> 02:32:20.371]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:32:20.891 --> 02:32:21.171]  Tim Geithner?
[02:32:21.191 --> 02:32:21.612]  Bernanke?
[02:32:21.712 --> 02:32:22.353]  They're arsonists!
[02:32:22.373 --> 02:32:23.374]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:32:23.474 --> 02:32:25.897]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:32:39.795 --> 02:32:46.677]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:32:47.077 --> 02:32:56.420]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:33:12.022 --> 02:33:12.942]  The Empire on the March.
[02:33:13.302 --> 02:33:15.703]  The Empire is on the run.
[02:33:16.463 --> 02:33:20.203]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:20.944 --> 02:33:22.544]  Alan Watt is our guest.
[02:33:22.584 --> 02:33:25.304]  He seems to come on whenever big events are happening.
[02:33:25.424 --> 02:33:26.885]  I guess good luck or bad luck.
[02:33:27.725 --> 02:33:28.745]  But he is here with us.
[02:33:28.765 --> 02:33:34.786]  We've got a top meteorologist who's been accurately predicting the weather for a long time and finally getting the attention he deserves.
[02:33:35.506 --> 02:33:40.107]  We're dealing with this ice age situation coming up into the fourth hour today.
[02:33:41.587 --> 02:33:44.428]  I know we're on several radio stations in the great state of Maryland.
[02:33:44.868 --> 02:33:45.968]  Great people up there.
[02:33:46.408 --> 02:33:52.690]  We hope that no one has been injured, but they're reporting packages exploding and they're not sure if there's injuries.
[02:33:53.390 --> 02:33:55.631]  This is a developing situation.
[02:33:55.711 --> 02:33:57.972]  Bomb squad at State Building near State House.
[02:33:57.992 --> 02:33:59.452]  There were mailroom employees injured.
[02:34:00.192 --> 02:34:02.113]  That's the Baltimore Sun saying there are injuries.
[02:34:02.173 --> 02:34:05.574]  Another WBAL-TV says they're not sure.
[02:34:07.075 --> 02:34:09.196]  My crew will continue to give us this as it comes in.
[02:34:09.216 --> 02:34:20.304]  A fire crew's hazmat sent to the Maryland Department of Transportation where they were investigating reported explosions at the Maryland Department of Transportation headquarters.
[02:34:21.403 --> 02:34:25.206]  And with all the drills and things they do, it just creates this hype and fear.
[02:34:25.246 --> 02:34:30.230]  I mean, I saw big accidents the other night, looked like they were fatalities, and we all freak out and get scared of that.
[02:34:30.470 --> 02:34:33.933]  We still drive our cars, 300-plus thousand dead a year just in the U.S.
[02:34:34.313 --> 02:34:35.754]  Millions dead every year overall.
[02:34:36.815 --> 02:34:40.738]  But then a few deaths here and there from, quote, terrorists, and our whole way of life ends.
[02:34:41.238 --> 02:34:45.541]  And now they stick their hands down our pants with the TSA, breaking our will.
[02:34:46.867 --> 02:34:53.056]  Uh, we did search terms today, and I haven't done this in about three weeks until yesterday, and it did become the number one search term.
[02:34:53.076 --> 02:34:55.179]  Uh, censorship Jesse Ventura.
[02:34:56.241 --> 02:34:58.504]  We're doing prison cities today, but...
[02:35:00.362 --> 02:35:08.245]  I said I might fire another key search term, torpedo, because for those that don't know, it causes hundreds of blogs, newspapers to pick up on it and look at it.
[02:35:09.025 --> 02:35:18.268]  With the history of stage terror and all the other mainstream news articles even saying stage terror in Maryland, D.C., Oregon, Washington State, Colorado,
[02:35:19.088 --> 02:35:19.989]  in previous months.
[02:35:20.529 --> 02:35:27.253]  We need to launch a big torpedo here with the headline, Maryland Staged Terror.
[02:35:27.793 --> 02:35:30.435]  That's even more important than searching prison cities.
[02:35:30.935 --> 02:35:33.036]  Maryland Staged Terror.
[02:35:33.576 --> 02:35:37.559]  Let's make it number one so all the people searching will
[02:35:38.519 --> 02:35:40.821]  See the blurb article, Watson and Steve Watson.
[02:35:40.861 --> 02:35:41.842]  Both Watsons are doing.
[02:35:41.862 --> 02:35:42.643]  Aaron Dyches is here.
[02:35:42.663 --> 02:35:44.685]  I want him on it at Infowars.com.
[02:35:45.085 --> 02:35:47.628]  We're going right back to our guest here in a moment to get his take on this.
[02:35:48.048 --> 02:35:49.069]  Salon Magazine.
[02:35:49.129 --> 02:35:53.012]  Lawyer, FBI, entrapped Baltimore bomb plot suspect.
[02:35:53.233 --> 02:35:54.974]  This was December 13th, just a month ago.
[02:35:55.835 --> 02:35:56.396]  Less than a month.
[02:35:56.476 --> 02:36:01.961]  No way Antonio Martinez could have assembled the phony bomb intended to blow up the recruitment center, defense says.
[02:36:03.143 --> 02:36:04.003]  Same thing came out.
[02:36:04.744 --> 02:36:06.144]  The government isn't infiltrating groups.
[02:36:06.164 --> 02:36:06.965]  They advertise.
[02:36:07.005 --> 02:36:07.585]  They promote.
[02:36:07.845 --> 02:36:14.928]  And it's always American idiots who convert and then get radicalized.
[02:36:15.208 --> 02:36:22.110]  Just like Texas Monthly in 98 gave a bum steer award to the FBI for creating a Klan group, trying to get them to blow up a chemical plant.
[02:36:22.651 --> 02:36:23.271]  For two years.
[02:36:23.751 --> 02:36:26.592]  The FBI cooked the bomb, trained the driver, told them to go ahead with the attack.
[02:36:26.972 --> 02:36:29.293]  An insider blew the whistle.
[02:36:29.313 --> 02:36:31.034]  1993 World Trade Center first attack.
[02:36:32.248 --> 02:36:42.792]  Amr Al-Awlaki, top of Al-Qaeda below Bin Laden, secretly under Pentagon control, Fox News, running the underwear bombing, the shoe bomber, the Fort Hood shooter, the Times Square.
[02:36:43.212 --> 02:36:48.594]  They go out and find, out of a billion, 100 million Muslims, fruitcake crackpots!
[02:36:51.175 --> 02:36:56.757]  I mean, this is, folks, I can't tell you how many times I've had cops in plain clothes come to events I'm at and say, let's blow stuff up, Alex.
[02:36:57.257 --> 02:36:59.018]  And I just start calling the police on them.
[02:37:00.464 --> 02:37:02.225]  And then they go, I'm an officer, and run off.
[02:37:02.265 --> 02:37:04.805]  I mean, look, that's what they do.
[02:37:05.426 --> 02:37:05.746]  Okay?
[02:37:06.566 --> 02:37:10.787]  I want to go back to Alan Watt on this, but the search term, Maryland staged terror.
[02:37:11.188 --> 02:37:13.468]  And all the rest of you out there, write your own articles on it.
[02:37:13.768 --> 02:37:14.929]  We've got the history of this.
[02:37:15.709 --> 02:37:17.750]  Man-arrested Maryland terror bomb plot.
[02:37:18.450 --> 02:37:20.711]  So, you know, this is Martina's person.
[02:37:21.591 --> 02:37:24.592]  I tell you, Alan Watt, this is so obvious what they're doing.
[02:37:26.331 --> 02:37:30.444]  Well, you gotta... If you're setting up a world of totalitarianism...
[02:37:31.175 --> 02:37:33.877]  And certainly, you've got to justify the reasons for it.
[02:37:33.937 --> 02:37:35.938]  So if nothing's happening, you make it happen.
[02:37:36.378 --> 02:37:37.959]  And this is a very old technique, of course.
[02:37:38.440 --> 02:37:43.663]  They've even put it in comedy shows like Brazil, where bombs go off every so often in restaurants.
[02:37:43.823 --> 02:37:48.146]  They never catch a terrorist, but everyone believes the propaganda of the terrorists that are doing it.
[02:37:48.466 --> 02:37:52.509]  So we need all of these checkpoints and pat-downs and so on.
[02:37:52.869 --> 02:37:55.251]  This is a simple technique, and it works very well.
[02:37:55.691 --> 02:37:58.713]  Most of the public, you know, listen to nothing but mainstream news.
[02:37:59.413 --> 02:38:01.095]  And that's what they believe.
[02:38:01.415 --> 02:38:03.337]  They believe it's all for their own good and so on.
[02:38:03.878 --> 02:38:05.279]  And they're cheap.
[02:38:05.619 --> 02:38:09.163]  They've already lost their ability to stand up for anything, most of them.
[02:38:09.723 --> 02:38:12.086]  Because the first attack was on men itself.
[02:38:12.705 --> 02:38:13.105]  I don't know.
[02:38:31.438 --> 02:38:32.479]  And it's all empty.
[02:38:32.839 --> 02:38:33.219]  It's all empty.
[02:38:33.239 --> 02:38:37.302]  There isn't that tribal fulfillment of taking care of your family and the men and women being on a team.
[02:38:37.322 --> 02:38:41.945]  It's a bunch of unhappy people, mad that life is hell, so they break up because they haven't submitted to each other.
[02:39:01.498 --> 02:39:01.919]  That's correct.
[02:39:02.279 --> 02:39:04.481]  It takes commitment, you see, for everything that you do.
[02:39:04.601 --> 02:39:06.203]  Even to fight this takes commitment.
[02:39:06.863 --> 02:39:08.585]  And you must only start with yourself.
[02:39:09.285 --> 02:39:12.268]  And we've all been contaminated with this system, and that's what it's called.
[02:39:12.709 --> 02:39:16.332]  Your indoctrination and your lifestyle is called contamination.
[02:39:16.752 --> 02:39:19.755]  And the Soviets called it that, too, since they helped introduce a lot of it.
[02:39:20.496 --> 02:39:23.739]  We've got their manuals where they describe everything that's been done here.
[02:39:24.491 --> 02:39:28.037]  Yes, and you have to decontaminate yourself, starting with yourself.
[02:39:28.598 --> 02:39:32.223]  And it doesn't matter what the rest go and do, and they want you to go along with them.
[02:39:32.243 --> 02:39:33.626]  You say, no, I'm not doing that.
[02:39:33.646 --> 02:39:34.968]  And if they ask you why, you tell them.
[02:39:35.858 --> 02:39:38.701]  That things are going to get awfully bad unless we discipline ourselves.
[02:39:39.121 --> 02:39:39.662]  We're doomed.
[02:39:40.082 --> 02:39:42.304]  And what do the FBI training manuals say?
[02:39:42.584 --> 02:39:50.010]  The white male who's nice and friendly, who's professional, who exercises a lot, who wants to be involved in the community.
[02:39:50.050 --> 02:39:52.372]  That's a Texas Homeland Security manual.
[02:39:52.652 --> 02:39:53.613]  That's the enemy.
[02:39:53.973 --> 02:39:56.836]  That clean-cut, pure person is an enemy.
[02:39:58.467 --> 02:40:05.994]  You see, what's been left for the rest of the public with the dysfunctional relationships and casual relationships is that they have no purpose.
[02:40:07.003 --> 02:40:09.185]  And to fill up a gap for no purpose.
[02:40:09.225 --> 02:40:13.007]  They've got so much cheap entertainment just thrown at them.
[02:40:13.828 --> 02:40:16.089]  Not cash in their pockets to go party at weekends.
[02:40:16.670 --> 02:40:18.651]  And that's what they think living is all about now.
[02:40:19.372 --> 02:40:22.714]  They have no bonding to any community or any family.
[02:40:22.734 --> 02:40:32.461]  And exactly, whether you're African or Japanese or an American, if you're a pure woman or a pure man or trying to be pure, they know you're going to see all of this.
[02:40:32.861 --> 02:40:34.182]  And so that's why you're the enemy.
[02:40:35.171 --> 02:40:43.375]  Yeah, and so therefore, as I say, you've got to start with yourself and change yourself and decontaminate yourself, even the things that you might be addicted to.
[02:40:43.395 --> 02:40:55.362]  I've had young people write to me who know what's going on, and they'll tell me that they still like certain parts of it, they like the parching, they like the multi-casual affairs that they have, sexual affairs.
[02:40:56.002 --> 02:40:58.263]  And they don't realize that that's all part of the destructiveness.
[02:40:58.283 --> 02:40:59.624]  You can't have it both ways.
[02:41:00.105 --> 02:41:10.090]  Because when you look at all from the primitive tribes to our own tribes that lived up into the 1800s, they all lived in the same structure, same family structure.
[02:41:10.631 --> 02:41:15.573]  And you can't go around just willy-nilly with promiscuity and all the rest of it.
[02:41:16.194 --> 02:41:17.434]  That destroys everything.
[02:41:17.475 --> 02:41:21.717]  And that's why it was the main weapon to be promoted during the 60s, 70s and 80s to the present time.
[02:41:23.839 --> 02:41:25.025]  You can't have it both ways.
[02:41:25.045 --> 02:41:27.779]  You've got to change yourself in order to change the world.
[02:41:29.096 --> 02:41:36.480]  And they train the so-called middle class to be in love with their servitude, as Bertrand Russell said they would.
[02:41:36.860 --> 02:41:43.723]  When you try to warn them, they have a defense mechanism to get a little creamy-eyed look, you know, in their eyes and giggle at you.
[02:41:44.004 --> 02:41:46.445]  And then they'll even accept it and say, yeah, I like it.
[02:41:46.845 --> 02:41:51.367]  They think by doing that Crime Stop mind trick, it gives them power over it.
[02:41:51.828 --> 02:41:56.150]  And the average male out there is an arrested development six-year-old.
[02:41:56.750 --> 02:41:57.831]  Yeah, oh definitely.
[02:41:58.311 --> 02:42:00.172]  And even politicians in the U.S.
[02:42:00.833 --> 02:42:10.259]  I read an article pretty recently too where one of the congressmen said that we must train the public by using the language of the media which is meant for the fifth grade.
[02:42:11.040 --> 02:42:13.782]  That's what they're using on the public and have been for an awful long time.
[02:42:14.426 --> 02:42:15.987]  But you're quite right, too.
[02:42:16.987 --> 02:42:18.207]  A lot of it's aimed at the male.
[02:42:18.828 --> 02:42:21.229]  As I said today, it's a shopping mall for sex.
[02:42:21.569 --> 02:42:22.589]  That's what all it is.
[02:42:22.709 --> 02:42:30.692]  And notice they don't let males act like warrior males in any context, and they put chemicals in the water to reduce testosterone.
[02:42:31.012 --> 02:42:37.735]  But then in one area, if you want to be a cop or a soldier, then you're allowed to act that out, but against your own people.
[02:42:38.866 --> 02:42:39.767]  That's absolutely true.
[02:42:39.827 --> 02:42:41.328]  In other words, winners and losers.
[02:42:41.368 --> 02:42:48.535]  And youngsters who grew up with video games, too, and dysfunctional families, or no family at all, that's how they see things in black and white.
[02:42:48.575 --> 02:42:49.395]  Winners and losers.
[02:42:49.776 --> 02:42:51.237]  And they want to be on the winning team.
[02:42:51.277 --> 02:42:52.458]  Some have told me that, by the way.
[02:42:53.199 --> 02:43:01.065]  And they want to get into the black outfits and have the big machine gun and order people about, because they know they're going to get more privileges than those who are under the gun.
[02:43:04.113 --> 02:43:13.921]  And they've gone from denying that police are being put on steroids to major city police chiefs, even here in Texas, basically ordering everyone to inject testosterone.
[02:43:14.921 --> 02:43:15.662]  Yeah, that's correct.
[02:43:15.762 --> 02:43:18.844]  And they've been doing this, really, for years, long beforehand.
[02:43:19.525 --> 02:43:21.446]  And they put it on the beef, of course.
[02:43:21.947 --> 02:43:27.111]  And you can tell, too, it's more than just an effect on your muscle, etc.
[02:43:28.027 --> 02:43:28.187]  The
[02:43:43.766 --> 02:43:59.076]  I've been listening to Howard Stern lately just randomly in my car on XM and every time I tune in he's glorifying police beating innocent people and how good it is and then I hear it on other shows that are for the lowest common denominator.
[02:43:59.257 --> 02:44:03.679]  They're teaching us that all of this evil is beautiful.
[02:44:06.121 --> 02:44:10.124]  And once again the public have been so desensitized to horror.
[02:44:10.856 --> 02:44:13.297]  What should be, should offend them as being horrific.
[02:44:13.697 --> 02:44:16.499]  It's not, it actually get off on it, just like a movie.
[02:44:16.919 --> 02:44:20.560]  They can't tell the difference between fiction and, in fact, it's better alive.
[02:44:20.621 --> 02:44:21.621]  That's what some of them say.
[02:44:21.781 --> 02:44:22.982]  Yeah, they're blurring the two.
[02:44:23.002 --> 02:44:31.525]  And it's also real popular on the internet for girls to abuse cats and dogs and ferrets and they get off on it.
[02:44:32.226 --> 02:44:36.528]  But then the minute they're being abused, they can't believe it and cry, cry for mommy.
[02:44:37.335 --> 02:44:37.515]  Yes.
[02:44:38.236 --> 02:44:40.017]  Or say that the government should build a law about that.
[02:44:40.357 --> 02:44:41.638]  And that's exactly what government wants.
[02:44:42.098 --> 02:44:43.779]  They love to put more laws on you.
[02:44:43.799 --> 02:44:48.082]  Yeah, they promote that we don't govern ourselves, so they will govern us.
[02:44:48.923 --> 02:44:50.144]  Yeah, absolutely, and it's true.
[02:44:50.164 --> 02:44:53.226]  If you don't govern yourself, then someone else is going to do it for you.
[02:44:54.006 --> 02:44:55.207]  And it's the same with your mind.
[02:44:55.227 --> 02:45:03.873]  If you don't take care, because you're the gatekeeper of what comes into your mind and affects you, then somebody else will, and they've been doing that for an awful long time.
[02:45:05.563 --> 02:45:09.186]  And now they have the kinetic game that's come out.
[02:45:09.607 --> 02:45:18.214]  And I heard the neighborhood kid telling my son about it yesterday, about how great it is that it face scans him and knows his voice and follows all his movements.
[02:45:18.314 --> 02:45:22.598]  And Microsoft admits that it's listening to your whole house with it.
[02:45:22.638 --> 02:45:23.599]  It's hooked into the Internet.
[02:45:23.999 --> 02:45:26.441]  And now they're erasing the Jesse Ventura TV show.
[02:45:27.302 --> 02:45:30.565]  Uh, off of the TiVos and, uh, U-Verses.
[02:45:30.966 --> 02:45:31.726]  We've confirmed that.
[02:45:31.866 --> 02:45:38.633]  Why would they let Ventura Show come out and then decide to start pulling episodes and banning the re-airing of certain episodes?
[02:45:38.873 --> 02:45:40.114]  Well, I know the inside scoop.
[02:45:40.595 --> 02:45:49.804]  They allowed it thinking that it would just be a conditioning mechanism, but for some reason, they decided it was having too big of a trigger, uh, and they banned the Police State episode.
[02:45:49.824 --> 02:45:50.945]  What do you think's going on behind that?
[02:45:51.636 --> 02:45:52.576]  You're probably quite right.
[02:45:52.597 --> 02:45:57.199]  It probably was meant to be a predictive programming overawing show.
[02:45:58.239 --> 02:46:00.561]  And people say, well, gee, what can you do about it?
[02:46:00.601 --> 02:46:01.301]  It's going to come.
[02:46:02.101 --> 02:46:17.309]  But the more folk talk about it, you see, and find ways to propagate the information to each other and find ways around it to combat it, or they get a big backlash about it, then they find it has the opposite effect than what they intended.
[02:46:17.742 --> 02:46:19.764]  But that shows an enemy miscalculation.
[02:46:20.145 --> 02:46:22.347]  And again, not that Ventura's bad or I was bad.
[02:46:22.367 --> 02:46:24.510]  I mean, we really put real shows on air.
[02:46:25.210 --> 02:46:27.253]  And, uh, it was funny, though.
[02:46:27.273 --> 02:46:29.595]  The network would come in to say the, um...
[02:46:30.726 --> 02:46:34.508]  Episode on bioweapons labs, Bioshield.
[02:46:34.788 --> 02:46:42.492]  It was a really serious episode, but the network execs above even TruTV said, put a Montauk monster in there.
[02:46:42.793 --> 02:46:45.634]  Put a dead animal that washed up to try to discredit it, yeah.
[02:46:45.794 --> 02:46:52.398]  But they were unable to get it all done, so now they're just like, no, stop, no, don't air it, no.
[02:46:53.493 --> 02:46:56.896]  Yeah, and I've had the same offers, too, to go on to some really big shows.
[02:46:57.556 --> 02:47:05.663]  I turned them all down because they want me to bring in the aliens and this and that and the other, and what that does, you then act for counterintelligence.
[02:47:05.703 --> 02:47:13.569]  Counterintelligence takes the factual data, they mix it with the farcical, and then people parrot that and sound like lunatics.
[02:47:13.889 --> 02:47:14.630]  Yeah, same here.
[02:47:14.650 --> 02:47:19.253]  I've turned down, just last year, multiple big national shows I would host.
[02:47:19.273 --> 02:47:22.075]  I mean, you know, ready to go, but they said, listen,
[02:47:22.896 --> 02:47:25.877]  The execs want you to do aliens mixed with it.
[02:47:26.818 --> 02:47:29.639]  And I'm like, and let me guess, chupacabras as well.
[02:47:29.659 --> 02:47:30.119]  I'm like, no.
[02:47:31.479 --> 02:47:33.820]  And people can't believe when you say no to them.
[02:47:34.520 --> 02:47:35.821]  Yeah, I know.
[02:47:36.281 --> 02:47:40.363]  And in regards to the cash that they offer and the whole thing, I've just turned them all down.
[02:47:40.943 --> 02:47:43.964]  Because every single biggie out there has asked me to do the same thing.
[02:47:45.629 --> 02:47:49.792]  Well, plus, once you've done that, they have weird rules, unwritten rules.
[02:47:49.972 --> 02:48:01.299]  Once you've taken one of their deals, even though it's unwritten and unspoken, then if I did that to use it to get even bigger, to then flip and expose them after, then they would kill me.
[02:48:01.539 --> 02:48:06.101]  But because I've always stayed pure, it's like a weird, unwritten rule.
[02:48:06.462 --> 02:48:07.342]  I know you've studied that.
[02:48:07.422 --> 02:48:09.123]  What is, what's behind that?
[02:48:11.004 --> 02:48:12.665]  Well, it's probably compromise as well.
[02:48:14.039 --> 02:48:14.399]  Unbelievable!
[02:48:44.247 --> 02:48:50.632]  Why do the globalists enjoy throughout history the initiated ones, the Illuminati priest class?
[02:48:51.353 --> 02:48:56.317]  Why do they love destroying their own, even servants that serve them perfectly?
[02:48:56.337 --> 02:49:00.761]  I mean, is it just part of a process of killing anybody who knows where the bodies are buried?
[02:49:00.781 --> 02:49:03.523]  It's partly that, too.
[02:49:03.683 --> 02:49:06.686]  It's partly that they're... Remember, they are an ultra-elite.
[02:49:07.383 --> 02:49:07.603]  I'm
[02:49:20.635 --> 02:49:21.396]  We're good to go.
[02:49:38.986 --> 02:49:47.571]  And you must remember, too, that Julian Huxley, who was umpteenth generation inbred for his purpose, because they were already, especially breeding.
[02:49:47.631 --> 02:49:50.712]  Yeah, he was the head of the UNESCO dehumanization program.
[02:49:51.193 --> 02:49:56.535]  Yeah, he admitted that he was, there were offspring of scientific elite, and he was one of them.
[02:49:56.575 --> 02:49:57.716]  That was his family's role.
[02:49:58.757 --> 02:50:02.999]  Yeah, most of the children died, but he and his brother were the only genetic expression, you know.
[02:50:03.799 --> 02:50:11.604]  And he did say that lots will think they're fit to come through into this New World Order as a servant class who serve them very well.
[02:50:11.624 --> 02:50:13.786]  But they're in for a big surprise.
[02:50:13.826 --> 02:50:15.087]  They will eliminate them too.
[02:50:15.107 --> 02:50:16.187]  They will no longer need them.
[02:50:17.068 --> 02:50:18.449]  And apart from that, they'll know too much.
[02:50:19.491 --> 02:50:23.013]  And I hope they're listening because the New World Order can't wait to torture you to death.
[02:50:23.033 --> 02:50:27.036]  So all of you out there thinking you're on the winning team, you lose.
[02:50:44.548 --> 02:50:46.452]  Only way we beat this is by defeating it.
[02:50:46.872 --> 02:50:48.395]  Alan Watt, let's talk about solutions.
[02:50:48.415 --> 02:50:49.437]  Your idea is straight ahead.
[02:50:49.457 --> 02:50:51.040]  A few more segments with Alan Watt.
[02:50:51.080 --> 02:50:51.781]  Always appreciate it.
[02:50:51.801 --> 02:50:52.883]  We'll give you his website as well.
[02:50:54.404 --> 02:50:55.685]  Just amazing information.
[02:50:56.125 --> 02:50:56.885]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:50:56.905 --> 02:50:58.986]  Don't forget the new search term, Maryland State's term.
[02:50:59.646 --> 02:51:00.587]  Go solar for cheap!
[02:51:00.827 --> 02:51:02.948]  Want to use solar power but the price is too high?
[02:51:03.268 --> 02:51:08.330]  Now you can build your own solar panels for less than $200 at 123cheapsolar.com.
[02:51:08.510 --> 02:51:09.110]  Don't laugh!
[02:51:09.170 --> 02:51:11.872]  We've sold over 45,000 solar do-it-yourself kits.
[02:51:12.092 --> 02:51:15.193]  Watch the step-by-step videos that even non-handyman types can use.
[02:51:15.393 --> 02:51:16.214]  We the people grow cotton.
[02:51:30.350 --> 02:51:31.671]  It's time to understand the system.
[02:51:31.711 --> 02:51:31.991]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:51:32.031 --> 02:51:32.291]  That's 800-686-2237
[02:52:00.521 --> 02:52:04.143]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:04.563 --> 02:52:07.564]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:07.804 --> 02:52:12.566]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:12.586 --> 02:52:18.829]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:18.989 --> 02:52:21.230]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:52:21.770 --> 02:52:22.871]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:22.891 --> 02:52:23.852]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:23.912 --> 02:52:26.033]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:40.663 --> 02:52:44.606]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[02:52:45.046 --> 02:52:47.548]  we have seen a fall of the republic.

[02:54:02.555 --> 02:54:05.336]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:54:07.811 --> 02:54:11.174]  Alan Watt here in just a moment, coming live at the fourth hour.
[02:54:11.194 --> 02:54:13.235]  Meteorologist as well at the eight after break.
[02:54:13.996 --> 02:54:16.558]  I want to tell you about End of America, the number three dot com.
[02:54:17.038 --> 02:54:24.464]  Stansbury & Associates Investment Research is an independent investment research arm, founded in 1999 by subscribers in more than 100 different countries.
[02:54:25.385 --> 02:54:30.867]  They recently created an eye-opening video you can see for free at endofamericanumber3.com.
[02:54:31.227 --> 02:54:33.228]  Again, that's free, endofamericanumber3.com.
[02:54:33.548 --> 02:54:35.849]  They're telling their biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:54:36.669 --> 02:54:39.190]  Again, that's endofamericanumber3.com.
[02:54:39.290 --> 02:54:41.271]  Check them out today, endofamericanumber3.com.
[02:54:43.456 --> 02:54:45.138]  Also made right here in America.
[02:54:45.478 --> 02:54:47.440]  They're still running that very popular special.
[02:54:47.460 --> 02:54:49.061]  8888 Gusset.
[02:54:49.081 --> 02:54:50.382]  High quality Gusset clothing.
[02:54:50.502 --> 02:54:52.164]  Motorcycle jeans, regular jeans.
[02:54:52.664 --> 02:54:54.666]  All right here made in the good old USA.
[02:54:54.726 --> 02:54:56.668]  Gusset.com forward slash America.
[02:54:57.068 --> 02:54:59.831]  And they've got a special when you get a couple pairs of jeans.
[02:55:00.311 --> 02:55:05.876]  You can get three free gifts, including t-shirts and a great audio CD about re-industrializing America.
[02:55:06.296 --> 02:55:13.962]  That's gusset.com forward slash America, gusset g-u-s-s-e-t dot com forward slash America, or 888-8-GUSSET.
[02:55:14.203 --> 02:55:17.565]  And to get those specials, free gifts, tell them Alex Jones sent you with your order.
[02:55:18.086 --> 02:55:20.468]  Okay, going back to Alan Watt.
[02:55:20.608 --> 02:55:22.189]  Alan, they're not invincible.
[02:55:22.229 --> 02:55:23.450]  They don't have all the answers.
[02:55:23.470 --> 02:55:24.831]  And I think one of the biggest keys
[02:55:25.572 --> 02:55:31.854]  As you just alluded to, is reaching out to the super class that Rothkopf called it, 6,000 super gophers.
[02:55:32.414 --> 02:55:38.815]  And really, and I've talked to some billionaires, I've talked to people, medical doctors that have treated heads of state.
[02:55:39.356 --> 02:55:44.497]  They will even confide in them that they're depressed about this, but kind of through fear going along.
[02:55:45.897 --> 02:55:48.518]  Just because they're raised into this, a lot of them don't like it.
[02:55:49.338 --> 02:55:51.819]  It's difficult to get through them.
[02:55:51.839 --> 02:55:53.980]  I understand the concept.
[02:56:08.526 --> 02:56:22.365]  They've had a lifetime of this indoctrination, and they still claim to the hope that they'll be the ones living in the more expensive, gated communities, well-armed, well-defended, well-fed.
[02:56:23.092 --> 02:56:24.052]  Uh, with the extra privilege.
[02:56:24.232 --> 02:56:26.693]  See, this world is to be a world of privileges, you understand?
[02:56:27.314 --> 02:56:29.654]  And every tier gets extra privileges.
[02:56:29.714 --> 02:56:31.355]  Even the cops get extra privileges.
[02:56:31.395 --> 02:56:35.176]  No, that's what Nick Rockefeller... It's an artificial state-run class system.
[02:56:35.216 --> 02:56:40.338]  Nick Rockefeller told Aaron Russo that the elite are all gonna have chips that say, kiss my hind end.
[02:56:40.358 --> 02:56:41.238]  Mm-hmm.
[02:56:42.039 --> 02:56:45.140]  And, uh, and as I say, too, they'll have to... And they do.
[02:56:45.200 --> 02:56:47.801]  They have to work till they drop, uh, the elite as well.
[02:56:47.821 --> 02:56:49.061]  They don't retire, as you well know.
[02:56:49.939 --> 02:56:53.242]  They're sworn on for life, and they don't get a break.
[02:56:53.442 --> 02:56:57.466]  They must go along and along and along with everything, and never give a slip of the tongue.
[02:56:58.086 --> 02:57:06.773]  It's hard for them to do that if they're at parties, etc., because that means an instant death sentence, or a cut-off from the food supply, or you'll get bunged in with the peasants.
[02:57:07.254 --> 02:57:12.838]  But the city themselves, as you well know, are getting set up to be the prison camps.
[02:57:13.279 --> 02:57:15.821]  As they take us down, they haven't upgraded these cities,
[02:57:16.961 --> 02:57:18.342]  They don't intend to upgrade them.
[02:57:18.442 --> 02:57:22.504]  They've let the roads rot for the last 30 odd years in preparation for this.
[02:57:23.165 --> 02:57:25.006]  And it's a rapid depopulation.
[02:57:25.066 --> 02:57:28.467]  They hope to depopulate rapidly over the next 50 years.
[02:57:28.867 --> 02:57:35.051]  And Rockefeller said that at the last meeting of what they call the Lucky Gene Club, where Oprah and Gates and all these guys go.
[02:57:35.071 --> 02:57:42.795]  He said, we've been very successful with sterilization and so on across the world, but now we must go into rapid depopulation.
[02:57:43.055 --> 02:57:43.375]  That means
[02:57:43.835 --> 02:57:44.215]  We're good.
[02:58:00.046 --> 02:58:05.310]  They're even building on the 15 acres they stole from landowners 14 years ago in Austin.
[02:58:05.890 --> 02:58:09.773]  Elite areas actually owned by the former city council people that took it.
[02:58:10.114 --> 02:58:17.119]  They're now the bankers and the state senators and it's openly neighborhoods with the criminals living in the luxury homes.
[02:58:17.539 --> 02:58:18.019]  That's right.
[02:58:18.059 --> 02:58:19.400]  That's how it's always been intended.
[02:58:19.421 --> 02:58:22.002]  Just like Brave New World predicted.
[02:58:22.303 --> 02:58:24.885]  Yeah, and they are so diabolical.
[02:58:24.905 --> 02:58:26.326]  They are so fully sick.
[02:58:27.332 --> 02:58:28.132]  Man, I tell ya.
[02:58:28.152 --> 02:58:28.212]  Mmm.
[02:58:28.272 --> 02:58:29.733]  Mmm-mmm-mmm.
[02:58:30.933 --> 02:58:31.893]  Back in 60 seconds.
[02:58:31.933 --> 02:58:33.054]  Final segment with Alan Watt.
[02:58:33.094 --> 02:58:34.374]  Alan Watt, fire out your website.
[02:58:35.674 --> 02:58:37.415]  It's cutting through the matrix dot com.
[02:58:37.475 --> 02:58:38.095]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:38.115 --> 02:58:38.535]  Stay with us.
[02:58:39.215 --> 02:58:42.416]  Are you tired of searching for great talk radio?
[02:58:42.436 --> 02:58:43.757]  Something more important.
[02:58:43.877 --> 02:58:45.197]  Search no more.
[02:58:45.397 --> 02:58:48.818]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[02:58:51.175 --> 02:58:54.776]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:58:55.136 --> 02:59:03.257]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:59:03.977 --> 02:59:08.018]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:59:08.618 --> 02:59:19.420]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:59:20.060 --> 02:59:29.062]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless gloyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:59:29.582 --> 02:59:34.643]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:59:35.004 --> 02:59:42.185]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:59:42.485 --> 02:59:45.246]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[02:59:50.123 --> 02:59:53.024]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:53.704 --> 02:59:57.005]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[02:59:57.025 --> 03:00:11.829]  Alright, it's hour number four, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:00:11.869 --> 03:00:14.369]  We are live, six days, Thursday, 2011.
[03:00:18.243 --> 03:00:22.205]  Here's Corbin, meteorologist, astrophysicist, joining us on what's happening with the weather.
[03:00:22.985 --> 03:00:25.967]  Finishing up with Alan Watt of CousinsOfTheMatrix.com.
[03:00:26.007 --> 03:00:28.188]  Again, I'm Alex Jones of InfoWars.com.
[03:00:29.448 --> 03:00:41.774]  Alan, again, I study the globalists, and they've got these overall managed systems, but they want managed systems that are totally surveilled, because if it isn't inside that surveilled system, they can't control all the outcomes.
[03:00:42.294 --> 03:00:44.135]  And I do see them making a lot of mistakes.
[03:00:44.795 --> 03:00:50.460]  But because they do have the finance, the capital on their side, they've got, you know, a lot of momentum.
[03:00:50.820 --> 03:01:06.273]  But I'm getting really positive and a lot of the political minds that I admire really agree that the globalists are not invincible and are not all powerful and that things are not going perfectly for them.
[03:01:06.794 --> 03:01:09.776]  But I know that your view varies a bit on that.
[03:01:09.836 --> 03:01:10.337]  Give us your view.
[03:01:11.431 --> 03:01:12.991]  Well, you see, they're quite right.
[03:01:13.011 --> 03:01:27.194]  I read an article recently where some of the top politicians said that for everything that they do, and for everything that they put forward, and plans and rules and laws, the public must accept them and acquiesce.
[03:01:27.294 --> 03:01:34.935]  They need our approval, our tacit approval, and silence really connotes your approval.
[03:01:35.675 --> 03:01:38.816]  And without that, they can't do anything, to be honest with you.
[03:01:39.777 --> 03:01:43.802]  If enough people simply said, and they could, but the problem is getting them to do it.
[03:01:44.182 --> 03:01:45.383]  No, we're not going along with this.
[03:01:45.444 --> 03:01:47.686]  We're not going along with this or that or whatever.
[03:01:47.706 --> 03:01:50.609]  We're boycotting all your airports, yadda yadda yadda.
[03:01:50.969 --> 03:01:55.795]  That could so easily be done, but you cannot get the public to come together in this day and age.
[03:01:55.815 --> 03:01:56.656]  They're so divided.
[03:01:57.696 --> 03:01:58.496]  That's your problem.
[03:01:58.536 --> 03:01:59.277]  It could be done.
[03:01:59.297 --> 03:02:02.658]  But for every totalitarian measure that comes out, you can simply say no.
[03:02:03.178 --> 03:02:03.578]  That's it.
[03:02:03.798 --> 03:02:04.739]  It will take martyrs.
[03:02:05.539 --> 03:02:14.642]  There's never been a change in history to get under the boots of tyranny that did not take martyrs going to prison for saying no.
[03:02:14.662 --> 03:02:15.982]  I'm not going along with that.
[03:02:17.363 --> 03:02:20.424]  You're not going to do this in some nice, hygienic way, believe you me.
[03:02:20.464 --> 03:02:21.404]  It's not going to happen.
[03:02:22.210 --> 03:02:27.872]  And it's not going to happen by pleading with them either because these guys have got too much to look forward to.
[03:02:27.892 --> 03:02:29.973]  They've been in the planning for hundreds of years.
[03:02:29.993 --> 03:02:33.814]  They don't plan to change it and turn around and be nice to us.
[03:02:34.434 --> 03:02:38.555]  These are monsters at the top who literally see, like H.G.
[03:02:38.595 --> 03:02:42.757]  Wells, he knew darn well about the killing of millions in Russia.
[03:02:43.437 --> 03:02:43.657]  I think?
[03:03:05.513 --> 03:03:14.018]  But at the same time, for every law and the minor laws, too, that they put out to tax you and carbon taxes and all the rest of it, you must say, OK, OK.
[03:03:14.298 --> 03:03:17.360]  And when you sign that tax form, you're acquiescing to them.
[03:03:17.921 --> 03:03:26.006]  And that's pretty well all you have left at the moment, is to change yourself and say, no, OK, I'll suffer and take the consequences.
[03:03:26.526 --> 03:03:34.691]  And with enough people locked up as martyrs, that's how Ireland helped to free itself, too, with all the thousands of people getting slammed in these prisons.
[03:03:35.972 --> 03:03:36.652]  During the troubles.
[03:03:37.613 --> 03:03:43.978]  And notice though, Alan, that how they tried to pass the EU the first time, then they pass it the second time.
[03:03:44.439 --> 03:03:48.462]  Ireland was this panacea of great, you know, wealth.
[03:03:48.522 --> 03:03:50.564]  And then overnight, oh, you're bankrupt now.
[03:03:50.884 --> 03:03:52.766]  Foreign bankers are taking you over.
[03:03:53.166 --> 03:03:56.969]  And the head of their central bank admitted, he said, foreigners now rule us.
[03:03:57.129 --> 03:03:58.150]  I think that's good.
[03:03:58.170 --> 03:03:59.912]  I mean, so in your face.
[03:04:00.812 --> 03:04:04.193]  Well, the Russian Mafia moved in on block.
[03:04:04.253 --> 03:04:13.997]  A whole lot of them, a lot to LA and the rest ran off to places in Europe, but Ireland was a big place because they were getting lots of grants from the EU and of course the Mafia was in there like a shot.
[03:04:14.537 --> 03:04:22.240]  And when the Russian Mafia accumulated all the dirty deeds and fake bonds and all the rest of it, they ran off with the loot and helped bankrupt the country.
[03:04:22.600 --> 03:04:26.682]  That was all set up in advance because the Russian Mafia works with the globalists, you see.
[03:04:27.691 --> 03:04:28.311]  Absolutely.
[03:04:28.352 --> 03:04:29.632]  Well, Alan, we're out of time.
[03:04:29.692 --> 03:04:30.853]  I appreciate you joining us.
[03:04:30.893 --> 03:04:37.457]  Look forward to speaking to you again with the great work you're doing on an upcoming Eugenics film we've got with incredible interviews with you.
[03:04:37.738 --> 03:04:38.398]  Great having you.
[03:04:38.418 --> 03:04:39.539]  Continue your great research.
[03:04:40.339 --> 03:04:41.380]  Thanks for having me on, Alex.
[03:04:41.680 --> 03:04:42.641]  Great having Alan Wad.

[03:06:01.639 --> 03:06:03.840]  We are part of a New World Order.
[03:06:03.960 --> 03:06:06.682]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[03:06:07.162 --> 03:06:11.905]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:06:12.265 --> 03:06:16.467]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:06:16.767 --> 03:06:19.111]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:06:19.231 --> 03:06:21.655]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:06:22.015 --> 03:06:24.579]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:06:24.919 --> 03:06:32.531]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:06:32.853 --> 03:06:38.115]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:06:38.235 --> 03:06:40.516]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:06:40.556 --> 03:06:44.538]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:06:44.778 --> 03:06:45.698]  And I got news for you.
[03:06:45.858 --> 03:06:47.159]  You're everyone else.

[03:08:07.293 --> 03:08:10.275]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:10.899 --> 03:08:14.260]  Are we a nation of truth lovers or truth rejecters?
[03:08:14.280 --> 03:08:18.642]  We've got Chuck Baldwin's latest column up at Infowars.com.

[03:08:26.405 --> 03:08:29.468]  The Globalist, where he's going in the future, just so much.
[03:08:29.508 --> 03:08:31.150]  That's going up on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:08:31.510 --> 03:08:33.432]  So is the Russell Means Native American Leader.
[03:08:33.792 --> 03:08:35.494]  An incredible video from Wounded Knee.
[03:08:35.514 --> 03:08:36.655]  That's going up Monday.
[03:08:36.675 --> 03:08:39.578]  A lot of exclusive videos at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:08:40.039 --> 03:08:43.362]  And don't forget, we're going to run this special for another week or two.
[03:08:43.742 --> 03:08:46.445]  We do it every Christmas and then into the New Year a little bit.

[03:09:00.554 --> 03:09:07.337]  Now, coming up in the next segment with him on a play, a short clip from Fox, and I've got other British news saying, you know, the same thing.
[03:09:08.038 --> 03:09:09.739]  We had this guy on a year ago.
[03:09:10.795 --> 03:09:16.077]  And the mainstream meteorologist and media were predicting basically hardly any winter, the end of snow.
[03:09:17.017 --> 03:09:24.739]  And he went in on our show, and he's a meteorologist and astrophysicist, and I've looked at his record.
[03:09:24.759 --> 03:09:30.741]  I mean, he's paid by different farmer almanacs, you name it, to really give farmers the real research.
[03:09:31.641 --> 03:09:32.802]  What the old-timers knew.
[03:09:33.022 --> 03:09:35.424]  They didn't understand it.
[03:09:35.464 --> 03:09:39.406]  They just knew the moon had a big effect on the weather.
[03:09:40.107 --> 03:09:46.351]  As basically a lensing or amplifying effect with the solar winds that sends in so many particles into the atmosphere.
[03:09:46.551 --> 03:09:51.634]  Then there's the other big contributor, which is the magnetic field of the Earth, but it's also affected by the solar winds.
[03:09:52.355 --> 03:10:01.141]  Mainline meteorologists supposedly ignore all this and use these ridiculous computer models that the science has found is about as accurate as a Ouija board.
[03:10:01.761 --> 03:10:02.741]  Or a wheel of fortune.
[03:10:03.602 --> 03:10:12.204]  But Pierce Corbin, year after year after year, and it's all chronicled at weatheraction.com, is accurate.
[03:10:12.524 --> 03:10:13.805]  A lot more accurate than mainstream.
[03:10:13.845 --> 03:10:20.907]  And he predicted the coldest winter in a long time, massive snowfall, when it would hit, what would happen.
[03:10:21.727 --> 03:10:24.429]  And ladies and gentlemen, he did this almost a year out.
[03:10:25.010 --> 03:10:26.631]  I mean, this is incredible.
[03:10:27.171 --> 03:10:35.698]  And he does it over and over again, following the old timer systems, which they didn't know why it was, they just knew the moon had to do with it.
[03:10:36.159 --> 03:10:44.866]  And he joins us, Pierce Corbin, to talk about what's happening now and what he sees happening coming up throughout the summer and next year, or is that too early to tell?
[03:10:45.186 --> 03:10:48.569]  Pierce Corbin, congratulations again on stunning accuracy.
[03:10:48.589 --> 03:10:50.951]  Thanks very much, it's great to be here.
[03:10:51.581 --> 03:10:52.402]  Well, you got the floor.
[03:10:52.422 --> 03:10:53.603]  We've only got you for 20 minutes.
[03:10:53.623 --> 03:10:58.169]  Tell us what's currently happening, how you predicted it, how it works, and what's coming up next.
[03:10:58.569 --> 03:11:07.880]  Well, last May, we said at a conference, an energy conference, that December in Britain would be cold and snowy.
[03:11:08.220 --> 03:11:21.807]  We didn't give any more detail than that, but then in November we put out a detailed forecast saying that we expected it would be the coldest December for 800 years.
[03:11:22.827 --> 03:11:24.948]  Nobody believed us.
[03:11:25.048 --> 03:11:29.490]  That is, in fact, exactly what happened.
[03:11:29.570 --> 03:11:35.733]  In fact, the central England temperatures are the second coldest in the full record of 352 years.
[03:11:38.030 --> 03:11:39.451]  I'm going to have to interrupt you, Piers.
[03:11:39.511 --> 03:11:40.071]  I'm sorry.
[03:11:40.111 --> 03:11:46.294]  You were here in May of last year, and people can go to my YouTube channel or PrisonPlanet.tv and watch it.
[03:11:46.674 --> 03:11:52.496]  You said on the east coast of the U.S., incredible snowfall, freezing, Canada snowed in.
[03:11:52.817 --> 03:11:54.697]  You predicted a super cold winter.
[03:11:55.018 --> 03:11:58.059]  I mean, you're really playing down what you did.
[03:11:58.459 --> 03:11:59.140]  Well, that's true.
[03:11:59.280 --> 03:12:00.401]  Yes, it's true.
[03:12:00.441 --> 03:12:01.061]  Fair enough.
[03:12:01.322 --> 03:12:12.051]  I was also going to add that we predicted the very specific blizzard which hit New York just after Christmas.
[03:12:12.791 --> 03:12:18.176]  And we put out a detailed forecast for that two weeks ahead, although we'd had obviously ideas longer ahead.
[03:12:18.376 --> 03:12:19.337]  Well, what is the truth?
[03:12:19.377 --> 03:12:23.981]  I mean, some news is saying the cold's in a thousand years, but we don't have good records of that.
[03:12:24.021 --> 03:12:24.662]  Others are saying in 300.
[03:12:25.482 --> 03:12:26.643]  I mean, what's your evidence show?
[03:12:26.663 --> 03:12:32.889]  I mean, is this, does this mark sliding into a new ice age as many astrophysicists and meteorologists believe?
[03:12:33.269 --> 03:12:33.990]  Yes, of course.
[03:12:34.350 --> 03:12:37.773]  Standard meteorology will just say everything's going to go back to the norm.
[03:12:37.793 --> 03:12:50.123]  Now we say, well, in Europe and in many parts of America for sure, it's going to carry on extremely cold in January and February.
[03:12:50.143 --> 03:12:57.769]  Our longer range view is that we are heading towards a mini ice age and we'll be well into that.
[03:12:58.550 --> 03:13:00.691]  It'll be at its coldest in about 25 years' time.
[03:13:03.033 --> 03:13:10.563]  We're going to see more of these cold, or very cold, winters with extraordinary blizzards in them.
[03:13:11.264 --> 03:13:17.612]  And more lousy summers, both in Britain and Europe, and in the USA.
[03:13:18.447 --> 03:13:20.888]  Okay, again, you're the true expert on this.
[03:13:21.288 --> 03:13:27.812]  How is your perspective on approaching the science so much different than mainline meteorology?
[03:13:27.852 --> 03:13:36.276]  I mean, I know you've broken that down before, but explain that to people, and then let's continue discussing what's happening this year and what you see coming next year.
[03:13:36.776 --> 03:13:37.757]  OK.
[03:13:37.797 --> 03:13:47.402]  Standard Meteorology looks at the weather now, sees how everything's moving, and then says, well, if that's moving towards this, something will happen, and then it will do this and that, and they can predict forwards.
[03:13:47.803 --> 03:13:52.766]  However, after about four days, it breaks down, and it becomes very inaccurate.
[03:13:53.026 --> 03:13:59.750]  The reason for that is there's external influences driven from the sun and the moon interrupting the
[03:14:00.390 --> 03:14:01.050]  I think so.
[03:14:20.835 --> 03:14:22.536]  I know, you predicted everything!
[03:14:22.656 --> 03:14:26.859]  You're a regular... No, I mean, I remember you in May of last year laying so much of this out.
[03:14:27.359 --> 03:14:28.740]  I mean, it's incredible.
[03:14:49.651 --> 03:14:51.652]  Well, yeah, we are very pleased.
[03:14:51.672 --> 03:14:53.033]  We want to be able to predict everything.
[03:14:53.113 --> 03:15:01.577]  As it is, 85% of what we say will happen does happen, but there's a lot of things we haven't yet got a handle on.
[03:15:02.298 --> 03:15:04.999]  But some very interesting things going on right now.
[03:15:06.056 --> 03:15:18.088]  Well, it's now obvious that the Queensland floods, if you look at them, the most likely floods have all happened, the biggest floods, in the same phase of the eclipse cycle.
[03:15:18.669 --> 03:15:27.518]  Namely, there was an eclipse of the sun on January the 4th, which was near to the peak of this current wave of floods.
[03:15:27.958 --> 03:15:28.739]  And the previous
[03:15:29.279 --> 03:15:44.412]  Previous waves of floods, very significant ones, were in 1954, 1973, 1992 or thereabouts, which are all separated by 19 years, which is the eclipse cycle.
[03:15:44.452 --> 03:15:50.077]  So there was also solar eclipses of around the 4th of January, those times as well.
[03:15:50.758 --> 03:15:52.299]  So just like a wind tunnel?
[03:15:52.639 --> 03:15:55.522]  Solar effect is why you get the floods.
[03:15:56.242 --> 03:15:59.984]  I mean, for laymen out there, like a wind tunnel.
[03:16:00.884 --> 03:16:07.768]  So when the moon is basically directly lined up with the solar winds, blocking them, what does that generally result in?
[03:16:08.408 --> 03:16:09.969]  It's more complicated than that.
[03:16:10.009 --> 03:16:13.390]  Where the moon is, obviously, given the date of an eclipse,
[03:16:15.311 --> 03:16:15.611]  We're good.
[03:16:36.441 --> 03:16:42.685]  The moon's motion is favoring jammings and stickings of the jet stream.
[03:16:43.425 --> 03:16:48.568]  And when you look at the rain map in Australia now, the standard meteorologist is pointing it.
[03:16:48.588 --> 03:16:49.769]  Look at all this rain, they say.
[03:16:49.789 --> 03:16:52.611]  Look, it's coming here and here and it's staying there.
[03:16:52.651 --> 03:16:53.751]  It's always in this place.
[03:16:54.071 --> 03:16:55.472]  I mean, it's a stuck jet stream.
[03:16:55.492 --> 03:16:57.273]  Now, they scratch their heads and don't know why.
[03:16:57.693 --> 03:16:59.555]  But, well, we know why.
[03:16:59.615 --> 03:17:03.517]  We don't know the detailed mechanisms, but we do know why and when it's gonna happen.
[03:17:05.574 --> 03:17:05.774]  Why?
[03:17:05.834 --> 03:17:06.735]  What's triggering it then?
[03:17:06.755 --> 03:17:09.716]  I mean, we understand the moon in relation to the sun and the solar wind.
[03:17:09.936 --> 03:17:28.523]  Well, the jet stream would be moving normally all the time, but somehow the moon interrupts the jet stream so that the motion, sorry, interrupts the solar wind so that the motion of the jet stream becomes stuck.
[03:17:28.823 --> 03:17:32.305]  Now, we don't understand the details of how it works, but we can
[03:17:33.046 --> 03:17:40.045]  Say when that type of thing is going to happen and when the jammings of the jet stream will will break down
[03:17:40.612 --> 03:17:49.754]  Well, meteorologist and astrophysicist, consultant and owner of weatheraction.com, who makes weather forecasts up to a year in advance with 85% accuracy.
[03:17:49.794 --> 03:17:51.795]  No one else can even get close to that.
[03:17:52.355 --> 03:18:03.038]  How can I, just as an average Joe, not a rocket scientist, know that the tides are caused by the moon, so why wouldn't the moon, if it can do that,
[03:18:03.738 --> 03:18:08.923]  affect the weather when we know the ocean is one of the biggest terrestrial drivers of the weather?
[03:18:09.223 --> 03:18:11.665]  How can mainline meteorology ignore that?
[03:18:11.685 --> 03:18:13.727]  I mean, that's moronic, is it not?
[03:18:13.747 --> 03:18:16.209]  Well, it is moronic, yes.
[03:18:17.510 --> 03:18:21.434]  But you see, they can't cope with what to do.
[03:18:22.234 --> 03:18:24.576]  And they don't know how to put it in.
[03:18:24.917 --> 03:18:29.040]  I mean, they could be a lot more intelligent and make applications, but you see,
[03:18:30.482 --> 03:18:46.318]  If they were to follow what we say, namely that the main drivers of all these things are external, it's the sun and the moon, then they're going to have to ditch their man-made climate change theory, and that is the core of their belief system.
[03:18:47.538 --> 03:18:55.080]  You know, so the Met Office in Britain now has even got to the stage where they put on the website it was going to be a mild winter.
[03:18:55.501 --> 03:18:56.841]  Then it was cold.
[03:18:57.661 --> 03:19:02.243]  So then they announced that they'd actually thought it was going to be cold and had told the government this.
[03:19:02.623 --> 03:19:04.743]  Now, you know, this is just unbelievable.
[03:19:05.023 --> 03:19:06.664]  I just don't believe them, frankly.
[03:19:06.984 --> 03:19:12.866]  It's very possible they put out two forecasts and afterwards they would say which one they really believed in.
[03:19:12.886 --> 03:19:14.066]  Obviously the one that we're
[03:19:14.386 --> 03:19:15.026]  Unbelievable stuff!
[03:19:42.774 --> 03:19:43.294]  Unbelievable.
[03:19:43.314 --> 03:19:43.754]  Stay there.
[03:19:43.854 --> 03:19:45.315]  Pierce Corbin coming back with us.
[03:19:45.335 --> 03:19:48.056]  We'll look into the rest of 2011 into 2012.
[03:19:48.756 --> 03:19:50.636]  What his yearly forecast is this time.
[03:19:50.656 --> 03:19:53.277]  I know it's a little early, but he'll be ready in the next few months.
[03:19:53.317 --> 03:19:56.378]  We'll get an early take from him on the other side.
[03:19:56.418 --> 03:19:58.459]  This is just such important information, obviously.
[03:19:59.685 --> 03:20:02.987]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[03:20:03.247 --> 03:20:04.328]  It ended on June of 2009.
[03:20:04.368 --> 03:20:08.751]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[03:20:08.951 --> 03:20:14.595]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[03:20:14.895 --> 03:20:16.877]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[03:20:17.037 --> 03:20:17.517]  Dave Beacon
[03:20:17.597 --> 03:20:18.117]  I think so.
[03:20:34.110 --> 03:20:39.112]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[03:20:39.392 --> 03:20:44.575]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[03:20:44.755 --> 03:20:47.716]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[03:20:47.956 --> 03:20:50.838]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[03:20:50.858 --> 03:20:51.958]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[03:20:59.378 --> 03:21:03.521]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[03:21:03.581 --> 03:21:04.842]  dollar has been devaluating.
[03:21:05.002 --> 03:21:08.705]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[03:21:09.005 --> 03:21:11.527]  Is there a way to protect your portfolios from losing value?
[03:21:11.747 --> 03:21:13.548]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[03:21:13.729 --> 03:21:16.030]  They both have maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[03:21:17.051 --> 03:21:25.779]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them until now, your cash would have the buying power of only $4,800.
[03:21:26.079 --> 03:21:29.262]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[03:21:29.322 --> 03:21:32.405]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[03:21:32.625 --> 03:21:34.446]  Call John Ballman today at 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.

[03:21:38.409 --> 03:21:39.149]  Call 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[03:21:39.189 --> 03:21:42.192]  Take action today while we still accept paper dollars for gold.
[03:21:42.212 --> 03:21:42.652]  That's 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[03:21:58.763 --> 03:21:59.905]  A very wealthy U.S.
[03:21:59.945 --> 03:22:06.673]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[03:22:06.934 --> 03:22:09.237]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[03:22:09.497 --> 03:22:14.684]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[03:22:14.884 --> 03:22:17.685]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[03:22:17.825 --> 03:22:19.946]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[03:22:20.166 --> 03:22:26.128]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[03:22:26.448 --> 03:22:29.669]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[03:22:29.829 --> 03:22:35.391]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[03:22:35.651 --> 03:22:36.971]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[03:22:37.312 --> 03:22:38.452]  I can't stress this enough.
[03:22:38.612 --> 03:22:41.174]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[03:22:41.294 --> 03:22:45.376]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[03:22:45.536 --> 03:22:49.979]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[03:22:50.079 --> 03:22:52.580]  That's End of America, the number three dot com.

[03:23:03.827 --> 03:23:07.810]  After my second heart attack, I knew I needed more help than I had.
[03:23:08.720 --> 03:23:10.780]  That's when Xtendivite came into my life.
[03:23:11.541 --> 03:23:17.822]  Made from garlic, cayenne, and five other herbs, I started to feel better in a very short time.
[03:23:18.442 --> 03:23:21.783]  My name's Don Whiskin, and I'm here because of Xtendivite.
[03:23:22.363 --> 03:23:25.203]  Xtendivite gave me more energy than I've had in years.
[03:23:26.023 --> 03:23:29.684]  I am the only one in my house right now that's not sick from colds or flus.
[03:23:30.444 --> 03:23:32.245]  And I owe that all to Xtendivite.
[03:23:32.945 --> 03:23:33.625]  My name is Rick,
[03:23:34.165 --> 03:23:36.166]  And I'm healthy because of XtendoVite.
[03:23:36.566 --> 03:23:38.587]  To get your XtendoVite, call 1-877-928-8822.
[03:23:38.607 --> 03:23:39.168]  That's 1-877-928-8822.
[03:23:39.188 --> 03:23:41.849]  Or, visit the website at heartdrop.com.
[03:23:42.229 --> 03:23:43.330]  That's H-E-A-R-T-D-R-O-P dot com.
[03:24:10.953 --> 03:24:17.355]  Well, we're really honored to have Pierce Corbin of WeatherAction.com on with us from England.
[03:24:17.435 --> 03:24:18.275]  Very busy guy.
[03:24:18.375 --> 03:24:21.536]  I twisted his arm to stay until 45 after because this is a short segment.
[03:24:22.176 --> 03:24:24.537]  And you know I don't normally gush at guests.
[03:24:24.637 --> 03:24:31.818]  It's just somebody who even mainstream media has to admit has about an 85% accuracy rate in year-out forecasting.
[03:24:31.838 --> 03:24:37.360]  I mean, they can't get anything right here in Austin past two or three, four days.
[03:24:38.160 --> 03:24:43.906]  So they can track a weather system and pretty much get down what it's going to do, but they can't track the larger areas.
[03:24:43.986 --> 03:24:56.238]  And so because they want to push man-made global warming, they have this quackery that the moon and the sun, and they said that last year at Copenhagen, an official UN declaration, that the sun does not affect climate.
[03:24:56.758 --> 03:24:58.320]  The sun is the driver.
[03:24:58.400 --> 03:25:02.283]  Is it not astrophysicist, meteorologist Piers Corbin?
[03:25:03.129 --> 03:25:16.818]  That's right, the Sun drives it and the main climate driver is through magnetic effects involving charged particles modulated by lunar influences.
[03:25:17.638 --> 03:25:24.303]  And the main cycles of weather observed on Earth are in fact solar lunar driven.
[03:25:25.283 --> 03:25:42.019]  The 60-year cycle in the Pacific temperatures and American temperatures is a solar-lunar effect and that modulates, if you like, the main magnetic effect, which is a 22-year cycle of world temperatures.
[03:25:43.191 --> 03:25:47.615]  So what is the current cycle point we're in right now and what do you see coming up in the next 12 months?
[03:25:47.635 --> 03:25:54.101]  Right, what we've got now is we're leaving the solar minimum.
[03:25:54.501 --> 03:26:00.747]  We've left solar cycle 23 and we're in the start of solar cycle 24.
[03:26:00.887 --> 03:26:08.354]  And it's been hiccuping in its starting and a lot of solar activity has tended to be low.
[03:26:09.575 --> 03:26:23.506]  And at the same time we're in a very fortuitous, if you like, lunar phase in the eclipse cycle of the Moon where we've just had some eclipses.
[03:26:24.527 --> 03:26:33.274]  And these appear to be accentuating the blocking tendencies of the jet stream which we predict.
[03:26:33.374 --> 03:26:37.678]  And these blocking tendencies are very important for extreme events.
[03:26:38.398 --> 03:26:38.978]  We're good to go.
[03:26:53.604 --> 03:26:59.149]  But the key thing is right now the extreme cold experience.
[03:26:59.790 --> 03:27:07.778]  And these extreme blockings are going to continue through January and February and right through the year.
[03:27:07.858 --> 03:27:16.706]  So we'll see a lot of extreme type of things, a lot more cold spells than the global warmers would like us to have.
[03:27:18.248 --> 03:27:27.161]  And it'll generally look like a kind of different weather situation where we'll go through this year compared with previous years.
[03:27:27.221 --> 03:27:33.691]  We've entered some sort of pretty fundamental shift I would say in weather patterns.
[03:27:35.089 --> 03:27:37.510]  Again, here's my simpleton question.
[03:27:37.710 --> 03:27:43.634]  Obviously the moon is involved in the same orbits and gyrations and is stable.
[03:27:43.674 --> 03:27:47.596]  But the sun, do we have any idea on its short cycles?
[03:27:47.676 --> 03:27:49.357]  Obviously not its long cycles.
[03:27:49.657 --> 03:27:53.419]  So it looks to me like that's a major variable and that the sun
[03:27:54.219 --> 03:27:54.560]  I don't know.
[03:28:09.056 --> 03:28:10.637]  Well, yes and no.
[03:28:10.657 --> 03:28:21.182]  There's a lot of things on the sun which are happening, which we can't see, but we nevertheless know they happen and change the way in which the solar wind gets to us and the magnetic linkages.
[03:28:21.262 --> 03:28:26.045]  And we can predict some of those very well.
[03:28:26.105 --> 03:28:37.570]  Like, we know there's certainly going to be shockwaves, if you like, in the solar wind, some of which will help blocking and give us, for example, a cold blast in Britain or America if the blocking is in a certain place.
[03:28:38.011 --> 03:28:38.531]  And others,
[03:28:39.051 --> 03:28:41.134]  We're good to go.
[03:28:54.451 --> 03:28:55.052]  I think?
[03:29:11.828 --> 03:29:13.128]  So we do know a lot about it.
[03:29:34.694 --> 03:29:35.194]  Okay, stay there.
[03:29:35.214 --> 03:29:36.615]  I want to come back and talk more about the sun.
[03:29:36.635 --> 03:29:42.417]  I want to talk about jet streams and a lot more with Pierce Corbin of WeatherAction.com.
[03:29:42.777 --> 03:29:46.058]  I'm Alex Jones of InfoWars.com, our final segment with our guest.
[03:29:46.498 --> 03:29:47.499]  Straight ahead, stay with us.
[03:29:49.459 --> 03:29:50.340]  We're on the march.
[03:29:50.840 --> 03:29:52.441]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:53.381 --> 03:29:56.062]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:59.312 --> 03:30:00.573]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:30:00.613 --> 03:30:05.979]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:30:06.219 --> 03:30:10.844]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:30:11.224 --> 03:30:16.270]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[03:30:16.790 --> 03:30:21.493]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:30:22.014 --> 03:30:23.935]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[03:30:24.335 --> 03:30:28.938]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[03:30:29.138 --> 03:30:30.039]  And here's the best part.
[03:30:30.259 --> 03:30:33.021]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[03:30:33.321 --> 03:30:36.623]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[03:30:36.943 --> 03:30:39.786]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[03:30:40.127 --> 03:30:42.009]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[03:30:42.349 --> 03:30:43.270]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:30:43.290 --> 03:30:43.470]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:30:43.490 --> 03:30:46.433]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:30:46.934 --> 03:30:48.696]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[03:31:00.197 --> 03:31:03.818]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:31:04.218 --> 03:31:07.219]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:31:07.459 --> 03:31:12.220]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:31:12.240 --> 03:31:18.482]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:31:18.642 --> 03:31:20.883]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[03:31:21.423 --> 03:31:21.703]  Tim Geithner?
[03:31:21.723 --> 03:31:21.964]  Bernanke?
[03:31:21.984 --> 03:31:22.524]  They're arsonists!
[03:31:22.564 --> 03:31:23.666]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:31:23.986 --> 03:31:26.429]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:31:40.325 --> 03:31:42.166]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:31:42.446 --> 03:31:47.208]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[03:31:47.588 --> 03:31:57.512]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:31:58.553 --> 03:31:59.373]  Pure water.
[03:31:59.673 --> 03:32:02.134]  What could be better than the gift of health for your loved ones?
[03:32:02.394 --> 03:32:04.275]  And who better to help you give the gift this holiday
[03:32:11.187 --> 03:32:15.471]  Chances are that water is contaminated with rust, bacteria, chlorine, and fluoride.

[03:32:59.491 --> 03:33:02.013]  Tolte said he can clearly say, I told you so.
[03:33:02.113 --> 03:33:07.976]  Back in November, the UK's government weather forecasting office claimed that this winter would be mild.
[03:33:08.376 --> 03:33:11.538]  That's the same office pushing a global warming agenda.
[03:33:11.998 --> 03:33:18.042]  But here's the forecast for this winter, as predicted in November by astrophysicist and meteorologist Piers Corbin.
[03:33:18.062 --> 03:33:18.482]  Take a listen.
[03:33:19.448 --> 03:33:32.693]  The winter, December to February, inclusive in Britain and Europe, will be exceptionally cold and snowy, like hell frozen over at times.
[03:33:34.054 --> 03:33:34.534]  He was right!
[03:33:34.554 --> 03:33:36.715]  It feels like that outside right now.
[03:33:36.795 --> 03:33:40.016]  You're looking at video of an extremely snowy Britain from this week.
[03:33:40.776 --> 03:33:42.017]  So much for global warming.
[03:33:42.077 --> 03:33:43.557]  He says prepare for the ice age.
[03:33:43.597 --> 03:33:44.898]  Piers Corbin joins us now.
[03:33:47.270 --> 03:33:52.815]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[03:33:53.275 --> 03:33:55.937]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:57.098 --> 03:34:04.985]  And the resistance to the neo-collectivist eugenicist is gaining steam.
[03:34:05.045 --> 03:34:07.307]  Republicans kill Global Warming Committee.
[03:34:08.408 --> 03:34:13.352]  Republicans have disabled the one committee devoted solely to climate change and energy issues.
[03:34:15.467 --> 03:34:25.634]  And we have other articles at PrisonPlanet.com with these bizarre people openly calling for euthanizing above 65s in the Guardian.
[03:34:25.674 --> 03:34:28.276]  You cannot make this type of bizarreness up.
[03:34:28.836 --> 03:34:31.038]  Calling for prison cities, rationing.
[03:34:31.058 --> 03:34:35.040]  I want to get back into the science with Pierce Corbin and his forecast.
[03:34:35.881 --> 03:34:44.447]  He was talking about the jet stream stalling over in Australia, but I'd seen alternative media claim that the blizzard was caused
[03:34:45.728 --> 03:35:08.561]  By a stalling of the main jet streams and he said absolutely and I looked it up during the break turns out he did predict that as well so wow that's that's pretty wild we'll get into all of that and his his forecast going into this year which the preliminaries are out on he'll have more in the next few months with a full year forecast but Pierce Corbin what do you make of the eco greenies
[03:35:09.361 --> 03:35:20.630]  Really going from claiming they're trying to save us from global warming to now just flailing around calling for eco-fascism and engaging in such bizarre rhetoric?
[03:35:21.330 --> 03:35:26.034]  Well, it is very worrying, and you know, it's not anything I would have imagined.
[03:35:26.074 --> 03:35:28.436]  They are so bad.
[03:35:29.496 --> 03:35:39.043]  You know, for example, just Fox News and ABC have carried me, and I've been in, you know, various alternative and some newspapers in Britain.
[03:35:39.343 --> 03:35:45.607]  But the BBC have totally, absolutely, totally ignored what I've got to say.
[03:35:46.027 --> 03:35:54.533]  And, you know, after these blizzards and so on in Britain and in America, all they can do is have apologies for global warming turning up.
[03:35:55.033 --> 03:36:00.736]  On the TV, saying things like, cold is warm, and we don't know what is going to happen next.
[03:36:01.056 --> 03:36:02.557]  Well, that's an exact quote.
[03:36:02.717 --> 03:36:03.257]  They could ask us.
[03:36:03.317 --> 03:36:05.078]  Well, I mean, that's an exact quote, though.
[03:36:05.098 --> 03:36:08.060]  They're actually saying, the new warm is cold.
[03:36:08.120 --> 03:36:08.800]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[03:36:08.980 --> 03:36:09.601]  Yeah, they are.
[03:36:09.641 --> 03:36:10.401]  They are, yeah, yeah.
[03:36:10.421 --> 03:36:20.486]  They've got some bizarre sort of idea that, well, there was some warm somewhere, which caused a bit of something to happen in the Arctic, and that caused this cold blast.
[03:36:21.887 --> 03:36:26.589]  Excuse me, you know, we predicted these events anyway using solar lunar activity.
[03:36:26.609 --> 03:36:29.170]  I mean, all their predictions have failed.
[03:36:29.530 --> 03:36:43.576]  These are the same people who told us that Europe would be without snow by the end of this decade and instead we've got more snow than we've ever had and the coldest December for over a hundred years.
[03:36:45.057 --> 03:36:45.658]  Incredible.
[03:36:46.058 --> 03:36:50.703]  I mean, I understand there's microclimates everywhere, but I mean, is it the coldest in 1,300?
[03:36:50.743 --> 03:36:52.685]  I mean, what's your data show?
[03:36:52.785 --> 03:37:03.537]  I can't say because we haven't got the data, but certainly we're expecting a continuing decline in world temperatures.
[03:37:04.077 --> 03:37:18.625]  So that we will be seeing the, on a more regular basis, the coldest winters for some, you know, two or three hundred years will start to become a lot more common.
[03:37:19.645 --> 03:37:22.287]  Jet streams, for those that don't know, describe them please, sir.
[03:37:22.747 --> 03:37:25.108]  And what's happening with the jet streams?
[03:37:25.408 --> 03:37:31.891]  You did predict there'd be a slowing or a stalling, and I asked you if press reports here that it may have stalled were accurate.
[03:37:31.932 --> 03:37:32.552]  You said they are.
[03:37:33.243 --> 03:37:40.665]  Yes, what you have at the jet stream is the general track of the low pressure systems around the polar regions.
[03:37:41.045 --> 03:37:45.927]  So they go one way in the Northern Hemisphere and the other way in the Southern Hemisphere.
[03:37:46.367 --> 03:37:52.769]  And generally when it's stalled in one, it will be stalled in the other half as well of the world.
[03:37:53.929 --> 03:38:02.672]  What happened during that New York blizzard or just before it was, for example, that we had a forecast we'd put out in detail that there would be
[03:38:03.512 --> 03:38:05.573]  We're good to go.
[03:38:24.743 --> 03:38:31.489]  And then they saw something and said, no, it's going to come out to sea, it won't hit New York, anything like much at all.
[03:38:32.010 --> 03:38:35.693]  And then 24 hours ahead, they started admitting that it was going to happen.
[03:38:36.073 --> 03:38:44.700]  And when it did happen, it was even more intense than they had said 24 hours ahead and much more in line with what we had said in detail weeks ahead.
[03:38:45.861 --> 03:38:54.929]  So, we are very pleased with that, although I have to admit, I feel sorry for all those people who are stuck in the ice, who were ill-prepared, because standard meteorology didn't help them.
[03:38:55.429 --> 03:38:57.211]  Well, I go back to what I raised earlier.
[03:38:57.231 --> 03:39:12.823]  How, if it's admitted, I mean, the ancients knew this, that the moon controls the tides, I mean, if the moon is generating giant seas globally, sucking the water out, you know, many feet
[03:39:13.746 --> 03:39:23.678]  Lower, bringing it in many feet higher to say then that it doesn't affect weather when 78% of the surface of the earth is covered by salt or fresh water.
[03:39:24.119 --> 03:39:26.362]  I mean, it's just completely ridiculous.
[03:39:26.402 --> 03:39:27.483]  How can they say?
[03:39:27.503 --> 03:39:31.167]  I mean, it's just it's it's beyond ridiculous.
[03:39:31.207 --> 03:39:32.169]  They know they're lying.
[03:39:32.609 --> 03:39:33.270]  They do.
[03:39:33.310 --> 03:39:36.154]  They know they're lying, but of course there's big interest attached to this.
[03:39:36.234 --> 03:39:46.968]  I mean, the people, they're self-serving pseudo-scientists, and the politicians in tow, or the scientists are in tow of the politicians, or whatever.
[03:39:46.988 --> 03:39:49.211]  I mean, they want carbon trading to make
[03:39:49.671 --> 03:39:50.612]  They want to make fast bucks.
[03:39:50.652 --> 03:39:56.856]  They want to control the development of energy trading around the world.
[03:39:56.876 --> 03:39:59.117]  They want to control agriculture a lot more.
[03:39:59.538 --> 03:40:08.804]  And they want the population to be stupefied and brainwashed and to actually desire to pay taxes to save the planet.
[03:40:09.104 --> 03:40:15.468]  There's never been a movement in the history of the world before where people have been clamoring to pay taxes for any reason.
[03:40:15.508 --> 03:40:18.210]  Now this is a fantastic opportunity for
[03:40:18.690 --> 03:40:29.617]  For all tax collectors and government, so they're not going to give it up lightly, which is why they will use the state media to suppress opinions of people like me and put brainwashing sidekicks on instead.
[03:40:33.920 --> 03:40:35.741]  Here's Corbyn going back to the BBC.
[03:40:35.801 --> 03:40:51.087]  It took them over a month to report on ClimateGate after it was already a huge story and now they still barely report on it and say it was an honest mistake when the emails clearly show premeditated lying by the UN picked scientist.
[03:40:51.847 --> 03:40:53.148]  But it expands from there.
[03:40:53.248 --> 03:41:03.414]  Since then, like a line of a hundred dominoes, every major fraud they've pushed has turned out to be a manifest, premeditated charade.
[03:41:03.434 --> 03:41:07.536]  I mean, where do you see their hubris going?
[03:41:07.576 --> 03:41:08.777]  Are they running out of gas?
[03:41:09.638 --> 03:41:14.781]  Well, they are running out of gas, but they do keep on filling up the tank.
[03:41:14.921 --> 03:41:19.984]  You see, the global warming scam is worth billions.
[03:41:20.794 --> 03:41:21.215]  Brilliant.
[03:41:21.335 --> 03:41:35.374]  I mean, we point out in our first news sheet of the year, which anyone can get on our website, weather action news number one for 2011, we point out that they've just put up value added tax, but they're
[03:41:36.054 --> 03:41:44.662]  They don't need to put a value-added tax at all if they were to scrap the pseudoscience of man-made global warming, because that could save 18 billion a year.
[03:41:45.002 --> 03:41:47.485]  Putting up VAT is going to get them 13 billion.
[03:41:47.805 --> 03:41:59.555]  So to do something intelligent in line with real science would actually, you know, get an increase of 5 billion, which they wouldn't, you know, they wouldn't have to do anything but to do with VAT.
[03:42:00.680 --> 03:42:02.842]  All right, we've only got about three or four minutes left with you.
[03:42:03.022 --> 03:42:15.313]  Other points, I mean I've been asking the questions, in your forecast coming up again here in the United States, other parts of the world, you called what happened in Central Asia with precision, the Russia heat wave with precision.
[03:42:15.513 --> 03:42:25.422]  Give us a brief, because I know you're still compiling for the next year, but your brief long-term forecast in hot spots around the world or the United States.
[03:42:26.022 --> 03:42:33.567]  Well, we haven't gone into a lot of detail yet, and we will do a lot more detail for the United States of America.
[03:42:33.787 --> 03:42:44.433]  But right now, we can certainly say that Western Europe and Britain is going to have a lousy spring and a wet summer.
[03:42:45.313 --> 03:42:49.196]  In America, it's very likely that parts of America will be like that.
[03:42:49.856 --> 03:43:05.868]  But we do have to be careful and understand how the jet stream is going to affect things because last year, for example, last winter we had very mild on the Pacific coast when it was cold elsewhere.
[03:43:05.948 --> 03:43:08.190]  So we have to see where the distinctions are going to be.
[03:43:08.230 --> 03:43:09.972]  Just to interrupt you, sir.
[03:43:12.108 --> 03:43:20.151]  I mean, just to interrupt, as you're using English nomenclature, quantify for us, what does a lousy spring, what do those terms mean?
[03:43:20.972 --> 03:43:25.754]  Lousy means cold and wet.
[03:43:26.114 --> 03:43:30.615]  So in terms of farming, it means that the sprouting of crops would be late.
[03:43:31.016 --> 03:43:34.037]  So it's bad for agriculture and bad for the economy.
[03:43:34.915 --> 03:43:38.117]  Okay, continue now with what you were saying for the summer?
[03:43:38.797 --> 03:44:01.548]  Yes, well in Britain it will be generally wet or very wet and there will be probably also a lot of extreme type wet events in America but we don't know where as yet and we will have to work that out and let people know.
[03:44:02.248 --> 03:44:05.609]  How did you predict the Pakistan flooding?
[03:44:05.649 --> 03:44:08.290]  How did you predict the Russian record heat wave?
[03:44:08.570 --> 03:44:16.833]  Right, well our look back map as to when there were similar weather solar magnetic lunar forcing in the past
[03:44:17.757 --> 03:44:18.658]  We're good to go.
[03:44:34.619 --> 03:44:41.901]  In terms of Pakistan, we didn't have any maps of Pakistan, so we didn't have any prediction that what would occur did occur.
[03:44:41.961 --> 03:44:48.183]  But when we saw what was happening for Russia, we could also see when it was going to end.
[03:44:48.703 --> 03:44:58.366]  And we could also see that that meant that the super deluges in Pakistan would end at the same time, because the whole pattern around the world was going to change.
[03:44:59.467 --> 03:45:13.642]  So we predicted to the day when there would be the end of the Russian heatwave and the final gasp of storms which would then completely peter out in Pakistan and end that super deluge there.
[03:45:15.459 --> 03:45:16.700]  It's happened to the day.
[03:45:17.861 --> 03:45:22.644]  But you're saying a general cooling trend in the next few years or an accelerated one?
[03:45:23.065 --> 03:45:28.929]  Yes, an accelerated one, I would say.
[03:45:29.229 --> 03:45:31.331]  Just on that Russian thing, it was very interesting.
[03:45:31.371 --> 03:45:33.833]  You could plot on the Sun what actually happened.
[03:45:33.893 --> 03:45:42.499]  There was a double sunspot, coronal explosion, and 12 hours after that you had massive thunderstorms in
[03:45:44.128 --> 03:45:44.628]  We're good to go.
[03:46:12.489 --> 03:46:17.752]  Well, Mr. Corbin, meteorologist, astrophysicist, you've been very gracious with your valuable time.
[03:46:18.092 --> 03:46:26.896]  Folks can go to your site and they can contribute or sign up and get your detailed forecast or get a lot of great and valuable general information all over.
[03:46:26.996 --> 03:46:33.940]  In closing, because when you were on last year, you explained to people that, and I'm putting in my words, but I want you to close in your own,
[03:46:35.000 --> 03:46:36.361]  I think?
[03:46:53.491 --> 03:47:00.578]  Uh, not so much modeling, but then being able to predict what happened because of where the positions were.
[03:47:00.838 --> 03:47:01.899]  That makes total sense.
[03:47:01.939 --> 03:47:02.780]  That's what you're doing.
[03:47:03.040 --> 03:47:04.422]  That's why you're so accurate.
[03:47:04.762 --> 03:47:15.132]  And that's completely different from pinhead, so-called scientists trying to fit the science and their limited technological meters to what, to how they believe things work.
[03:47:15.732 --> 03:47:16.933]  Yes, absolutely right.
[03:47:17.253 --> 03:47:24.336]  The current approach of what calls itself climate science is arrogant beyond belief.
[03:47:24.816 --> 03:47:28.837]  They imagine that their machines know more about nature than nature does itself.
[03:47:29.618 --> 03:47:32.419]  Nature is its own computer.
[03:47:32.839 --> 03:47:40.522]  In fact, we could never construct anything advanced enough to compute everything that happens in the sun, between the sun and the earth, and the earth.
[03:47:40.942 --> 03:47:53.494]  To give the details of what happens but we can look at the past as to when very similar things were driving and that is how we make our predictions.
[03:47:53.974 --> 03:48:01.842]  We try to understand nature instead of assuming we are understanding it and able to control it, which we cannot.
[03:48:02.415 --> 03:48:07.577]  Well, I remember reading Farmer's Almanac when I was a kid, and, you know, they said it was all about the moon.
[03:48:07.597 --> 03:48:10.398]  I mean, they didn't know why, they just knew there was a relationship.
[03:48:10.899 --> 03:48:12.219]  Well, that's absolutely right.
[03:48:12.259 --> 03:48:30.647]  I mean, it's obviously, well, not obviously, but it isn't just the tidal matter which happens every fortnight, but it's also the whole cycle of the moon, indeed, the whole cycle of eclipses, which is a 19-year cycle, and there's many sub-cycles within that, you see, of the
[03:48:31.167 --> 03:48:34.770]  Well, your accuracy rate is the proof that you are a true scientist and a real treasure.
[03:48:34.830 --> 03:48:37.712]  Thank you for spending time with us.
[03:48:37.752 --> 03:48:38.332]  Thank you very much.
[03:48:38.352 --> 03:48:39.473]  It's great to be with you.
[03:48:39.493 --> 03:48:42.696]  All right, there goes Pierce Corbin, weatheraction.com.
[03:48:42.716 --> 03:48:44.317]  Have a great New Year, sir.
[03:48:58.069 --> 03:49:06.472]  Well, that was amazing, ladies and gentlemen, and 85% accuracy rate a year out.
[03:49:06.632 --> 03:49:07.933]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[03:49:08.533 --> 03:49:20.018]  Because he's a real scientist and knows the sun and the moon are affecting much of what happens on Earth, and the Earth's own magnetic field affects that, and people
[03:49:21.516 --> 03:49:33.467]  Breathing, trees respirating, cows passing gas, that is such a tiny effect overall.
[03:49:35.668 --> 03:49:41.474]  But they want to demonize normal carbon cycle so they can control it.
[03:49:42.557 --> 03:49:53.622]  While engaging in legions of true dangerous events, detonating nukes in the upper atmosphere, using de-uge, open-air cross-species genetic engineering.
[03:49:54.583 --> 03:49:56.944]  Things that in the whole history of this planet have never been done.
[03:49:58.027 --> 03:50:02.069]  And proving that it's causing dangerous mutations and problems.
[03:50:02.689 --> 03:50:09.172]  And huge super colliders colliding heavy particles together.
[03:50:10.053 --> 03:50:12.694]  I mean, all extremely dangerous.
[03:50:13.194 --> 03:50:18.637]  And they tell us all of that's not dangerous, but carbon dioxide is just this devil gas.
[03:50:18.917 --> 03:50:19.637]  It's gonna kill us all.
[03:50:21.538 --> 03:50:22.779]  They know it's a fraud.
[03:50:22.859 --> 03:50:26.901]  It is a giant, sickening, huge joke to them.
[03:50:28.166 --> 03:50:28.947]  And they love it.
[03:50:30.428 --> 03:50:32.689]  I will assure you that sun is the main driver.
[03:50:33.269 --> 03:50:37.032]  You go out there on a July day and a clear day, it'll burn your skin.
[03:50:37.392 --> 03:50:38.633]  It's what makes the plants grow.
[03:50:38.953 --> 03:50:39.994]  It's what heats the earth.
[03:50:40.514 --> 03:50:44.457]  The earth would be so, so far below zero it makes your head spin.
[03:50:45.697 --> 03:50:47.739]  It'd be an absolute zero without the sun.
[03:50:48.539 --> 03:50:51.161]  And the UN says the sun doesn't affect our climate.
[03:50:51.922 --> 03:50:56.045]  Ladies and gentlemen, are we that stupid to buy that ridiculous line?
[03:50:56.065 --> 03:50:59.248]  Final segment straight ahead in an unbelievable retransmission.
[03:50:59.548 --> 03:51:04.412]  How well and how fast does heart and body extract work to improve blood circulation?
[03:51:04.793 --> 03:51:05.073]  Listen.
[03:51:05.473 --> 03:51:09.459]  My name is Ellis, and I'm 66 years old, and I live in Jacksonville, Florida.
[03:51:09.759 --> 03:51:12.763]  Two years ago, I was diagnosed as having clogged arteries.
[03:51:13.144 --> 03:51:15.968]  I had 70% blockage in one artery, leading to my heart.
[03:51:16.188 --> 03:51:19.573]  They wanted me to go on Plavix, but I refused, knowing the negative side effects.
[03:51:19.972 --> 03:51:28.201]  Heart and Body Extract is a unique balance, synergy and proportion of herbs reaching from head to toe at maximum absorption around 95% at the cellular level.
[03:51:28.381 --> 03:51:30.804]  Within the first month I felt a dramatic difference.
[03:51:30.944 --> 03:51:35.309]  The heaviness in my legs was reduced and within two months I felt completely normal.
[03:51:35.529 --> 03:51:39.373]  Your natural organic herbal formula for heart health is Heart and Body Extract.
[03:51:39.733 --> 03:51:43.577]  Heart and Body Extract comes with a 100% ironclad money-back guarantee.

[03:51:48.882 --> 03:51:50.263]  866-295-5305 for Heart and Body Extract.
[03:51:58.493 --> 03:51:59.614]  A very wealthy U.S.
[03:51:59.674 --> 03:52:06.382]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[03:52:06.642 --> 03:52:08.945]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[03:52:09.225 --> 03:52:14.411]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[03:52:14.611 --> 03:52:17.413]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[03:52:17.553 --> 03:52:19.675]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[03:52:19.875 --> 03:52:25.840]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[03:52:26.161 --> 03:52:29.383]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[03:52:29.563 --> 03:52:35.128]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[03:52:35.388 --> 03:52:36.709]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[03:52:37.029 --> 03:52:38.270]  I can't stress this enough.
[03:52:38.350 --> 03:52:40.893]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[03:52:41.033 --> 03:52:42.454]  He explains everything you need to know.
[03:52:42.714 --> 03:52:45.056]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[03:52:58.726 --> 03:53:00.588]  Not all protein supplements are created equal.
[03:53:00.988 --> 03:53:09.576]  One World Whey is the first cold-temperature-processed, 100% all-natural, unrefined, bioactive, grass-pasture-raised, milk-whey protein.
[03:53:09.977 --> 03:53:22.689]  Far from being another ordinary protein supplement, One World Whey is a full-spectrum nutrition power food in and of itself, providing overall life-building benefits that touch virtually every human's life, that other protein supplements don't deliver on.
[03:53:23.149 --> 03:53:23.949]  What are the benefits?
[03:53:24.309 --> 03:53:36.813]  Boosts the immune system, anti-aging properties, helps detoxification, helps reduce body fat, excellent for building lean muscle, increases energy levels, enhances the feelings of youth, sports performance, exercise recovery.
[03:53:37.334 --> 03:53:37.874]  Who's it for?
[03:53:38.274 --> 03:53:47.317]  Busy people, hard-working executives, students, teachers, active seniors, people recovering from illness, office workers, construction workers, and high-performance athletes.
[03:53:47.797 --> 03:53:49.478]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit oneworldway.com.
[03:53:49.518 --> 03:53:50.499]  That's oneworld, W-H-E-Y dot com.
[03:54:05.857 --> 03:54:19.665]  If you missed the second hour of the broadcast, I got into the unbelievable open announcements that they're going to turn the cities into prison cities to control our every move and literally call us prisoners and ration everything we do.
[03:54:20.779 --> 03:54:22.780]  We've also got new reports out by Watson.
[03:54:22.961 --> 03:54:24.482]  Maryland stage terror plot.
[03:54:24.622 --> 03:54:27.003]  FBI caught provocateuring patsies.
[03:54:27.023 --> 03:54:28.484]  We're trying to make that a big search term.
[03:54:28.524 --> 03:54:29.725]  Maryland stage terror.
[03:54:30.065 --> 03:54:30.746]  Those three words.
[03:54:30.786 --> 03:54:32.207]  And also prison cities today.
[03:54:32.227 --> 03:54:34.008]  In fact, let's check Google Trends.
[03:54:34.408 --> 03:54:35.609]  And we did that in the first hour.
[03:54:35.649 --> 03:54:38.251]  It should be becoming the number one trend in the next 30 minutes or so.
[03:54:38.311 --> 03:54:39.892]  If it is going to become the number one trend.
[03:54:40.272 --> 03:54:43.595]  I think we've only failed a few times and had it, you know, in the top five or so.
[03:54:44.275 --> 03:54:47.198]  But I would imagine the listeners come through big time against the enemy.
[03:54:47.619 --> 03:54:48.960]  So we'll check Google Trends right now.
[03:54:48.980 --> 03:54:51.083]  I got a few other news items I want to hit.
[03:54:51.163 --> 03:54:58.651]  But first, talking about the sun, that thing that doesn't affect our climate, according to the United Nations, because they say so.
[03:55:00.657 --> 03:55:02.458]  That's like saying water isn't wet.
[03:55:02.498 --> 03:55:05.521]  I mean, it's just such a ridiculous lie on the face of it, and they know full well.
[03:55:06.422 --> 03:55:08.283]  MySolarBackup, have you lost your power?
[03:55:08.303 --> 03:55:10.285]  Want to simply flip the switch on to get the lights back on?
[03:55:10.325 --> 03:55:18.711]  If so, you should check out MySolarBackup.com, because there's never been a better time to start getting off the grid and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[03:55:19.412 --> 03:55:22.914]  I, myself, am moving out to the countryside and going solar and rainwater and all that.
[03:55:22.934 --> 03:55:23.315]  I'm done.
[03:55:24.486 --> 03:55:27.268]  I mean, I can't leave the country, so I'm going to do the next best thing.
[03:55:28.628 --> 03:55:30.769]  Go to MySolarBackup.com.
[03:55:30.789 --> 03:55:31.770]  They've got a great unit.
[03:55:31.950 --> 03:55:33.571]  You can buy a bunch of them and run your whole house.
[03:55:33.971 --> 03:55:34.772]  MySolarBackup.com, 877-327-0365.
[03:55:34.832 --> 03:55:37.053]  The government doesn't own the sun yet, folks, so MySolarBackup.com, 877-327-0365.
[03:55:46.254 --> 03:55:51.680]  A lot of other news I didn't get to, and for some reason it's like it's impossible to get to this.
[03:55:52.241 --> 03:56:00.330]  Because I covered the eugenics today, and I meant to then integrate it in with the surveillance city that they're creating.
[03:56:01.652 --> 03:56:03.494]  Each city to be a total panoptagon.
[03:56:04.675 --> 03:56:14.042]  But the spy satellites for global warming are really spy satellites to track your heat resonance, that they get your body heat resonance biometric code, then they track you by satellite.
[03:56:14.302 --> 03:56:15.543]  That's now mainstream news.
[03:56:16.024 --> 03:56:19.186]  Detroit public schools getting 40,000 laptop stimulus funds.
[03:56:19.226 --> 03:56:22.248]  The federal government will watch the kids over those, just like Pennsylvania.
[03:56:22.729 --> 03:56:26.131]  Computers that see you and keep watch over you.
[03:56:26.151 --> 03:56:27.492]  I've been talking about this since
[03:56:28.723 --> 03:56:29.363]  Since Monday.
[03:56:29.743 --> 03:56:30.464]  Never got to it.
[03:56:30.664 --> 03:56:32.264]  It's such an incredible article.
[03:56:32.665 --> 03:56:36.126]  It says everything you do will be watched in live time for your own good.
[03:56:36.146 --> 03:56:38.227]  I mean, they just announced total 1984.
[03:56:39.907 --> 03:56:45.409]  It says here that prisoners will be watched, but also doctors and nurses making sure they wash their hands.
[03:56:45.689 --> 03:56:46.650]  Guilty until proven innocent.
[03:56:49.111 --> 03:56:55.435]  Again, it says, computer vision systems can watch hospital room and remind doctors to nurses to wash their hands are worn of restless patients.
[03:56:55.835 --> 03:56:57.477]  Oh, they say you didn't take care of your baby, right?
[03:56:57.497 --> 03:56:58.237]  They'll take your kid.
[03:56:58.277 --> 03:57:01.239]  That's already going in in England who are in danger of falling out of bed.
[03:57:01.259 --> 03:57:07.523]  It can go through a computer equipped system and the computer decides and then alerts people.
[03:57:07.903 --> 03:57:09.544]  And then that's actually in the news today.
[03:57:09.664 --> 03:57:11.846]  DARPA claims they're just now rolling this out.
[03:57:12.826 --> 03:57:16.288]  Utah's 1.5 billion cyber security center underway.
[03:57:16.328 --> 03:57:17.769]  They already built one in San Antonio.
[03:57:18.129 --> 03:57:20.470]  Court okay searches of cell phones without warrant.
[03:57:20.750 --> 03:57:22.951]  They're just openly announcing they're spying on everything.
[03:57:23.491 --> 03:57:24.792]  That's San Francisco Chronicle.
[03:57:25.472 --> 03:57:26.653]  What's Traderware?
[03:57:26.753 --> 03:57:31.135]  All these new iPhone apps and other droid apps that spy on you and everybody else.
[03:57:31.515 --> 03:57:32.416]  Tattletale apps.
[03:57:35.097 --> 03:57:35.357]  U.S.
[03:57:35.397 --> 03:57:42.585]  tells agencies watch insiders to prevent new WikiLeaks, and it's saying anybody who doesn't act happy or enthusiastic may be a traitor.
[03:57:43.366 --> 03:57:49.292]  So it's just, again, the panoptagon of total spying to ensure the criminality of the government and corporations continues.
[03:57:49.933 --> 03:57:53.557]  See, telling the truth is becoming a crime, or exposing crime is becoming a crime.
[03:57:56.158 --> 03:57:59.903]  I'm out of time on that, but I'm going to go back into this more tomorrow, as promised.
[03:58:00.063 --> 03:58:02.006]  More very informative guests tomorrow.
[03:58:02.386 --> 03:58:06.451]  Excellent job in the four-hour transmission today by the great crew.
[03:58:06.531 --> 03:58:11.638]  Marley, Jaron, Bill, Matt, everybody.
[03:58:11.858 --> 03:58:12.659]  Absolutely.
[03:58:13.360 --> 03:58:13.720]  Who else?
[03:58:15.228 --> 03:58:15.588]  Oh, yes.
[03:58:15.848 --> 03:58:16.088]  Yes.
[03:58:16.788 --> 03:58:18.969]  And, uh, and Philberto as well.
[03:58:19.409 --> 03:58:22.270]  So, everybody has done a super job today.
[03:58:22.510 --> 03:58:23.930]  Another strike against tyranny.
[03:58:24.290 --> 03:58:27.011]  Another emergency transmission to wake folks up.
[03:58:27.031 --> 03:58:30.672]  Now, come up for retransmission at InfoWars.com and stations that re-air it.
[03:58:30.932 --> 03:58:36.414]  I'm breaking down the incredible eugenics announcements that are off the charts insane and confirm our worst fears.
[03:58:36.734 --> 03:58:37.754]  See you back live tomorrow at 11 a.m.
[03:58:37.774 --> 03:58:38.054]  Central.
[03:58:39.094 --> 03:58:40.895]  The GCN Radio Network.
