[00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:05.130]  Big Brother.
[00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:06.870]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.591 --> 00:00:08.731]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.351 --> 00:00:10.171]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.931 --> 00:00:11.911]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.472 --> 00:00:16.072]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.672 --> 00:00:20.793]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.714 --> 00:00:29.175]  The Great Quake of Japan.
[00:00:30.796 --> 00:00:31.917]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:32.757 --> 00:00:38.560]  An 8.9 mega-earthquake causes chaos in Japan.
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.383]  Multiple waves of tsunamis deluging large parts of major towns and cities.
[00:00:44.943 --> 00:00:46.564]  Hundreds and hundreds confirmed dead.
[00:00:46.604 --> 00:00:47.945]  Thousands probably dead.
[00:00:48.725 --> 00:00:51.166]  Our hearts and prayers go out to all of them.
[00:00:52.647 --> 00:00:58.933]  We're going to be going through, here live on air, the maps, the details, exactly what's unfolding there.
[00:00:58.973 --> 00:01:08.061]  The latest, we've been trying to get a hold of Mr. Corbett, who lives in Japan, who's a contributor to this radio-slash-TV transmission, but we're unable to get a hold of him.
[00:01:08.081 --> 00:01:16.488]  I want to open the phones up specifically for people in the areas affected in Japan or nearby areas for your reports.
[00:01:16.988 --> 00:01:18.209]  Of course, the biggest issue
[00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.330]  I
[00:01:36.594 --> 00:01:45.820]  And under Japanese law, they are ordered to declare a national emergency whenever the coolant has failed.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.182]  And there's the headline from Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:01:49.643 --> 00:01:54.366]  Japan declares nuclear emergency after devastating earthquake.
[00:01:54.846 --> 00:02:00.930]  Attempts to cool malfunctioning reactor cores at the Fukushima No.
[00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.931]  1 nuclear plant have failed.
[00:02:03.853 --> 00:02:07.973]  And so we're going to be going through all of that today.
[00:02:15.012 --> 00:02:18.555]  Record quake unleashes tsunami on Japan.
[00:02:19.596 --> 00:02:35.649]  Again, a massive 8.9 magnitude earthquake rocked northeast Japan on Friday afternoon, setting a nuclear plant ablaze and unleashing a 10-meter tsunami that tossed ships inland and again left a lot of people dead.
[00:02:35.669 --> 00:02:37.351]  Here's another headline.
[00:02:37.411 --> 00:02:39.372]  Hundreds killed in tsunami after 8.9 earthquake.
[00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:42.555]  Uh, in Japan.
[00:02:43.455 --> 00:02:44.536]  Continuing, Oregon.
[00:02:44.556 --> 00:02:49.059]  The state of Oregon advises coastal residents to evacuate.
[00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:49.940]  That's Reuters.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.001]  That's here in the United States.
[00:02:52.902 --> 00:02:55.343]  Uh, thousands roam Tokyo streets.
[00:02:56.204 --> 00:02:58.826]  Uh, stations after, uh, quake.
[00:02:59.686 --> 00:03:01.927]  That's out of Associated Press.
[00:03:02.327 --> 00:03:05.088]  Here's another one out of the West Coast of the United States.
[00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:10.671]  Deputies knock on doors to evacuate Washington town.
[00:03:10.731 --> 00:03:27.038]  Sheriff's deputies and firefighters in Washington's Grays Harbor County are knocking on doors in low-flying areas of the small coastal community of Moe Clips, handing out tsunami warning flyers and urging residents to evacuate.
[00:03:28.118 --> 00:03:31.259]  Continuing, tsunami waves sweep Hawaii.
[00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:34.381]  No major damage yet in the first waves.
[00:03:34.801 --> 00:03:36.161]  That's out of Associated Press.
[00:03:36.321 --> 00:03:38.162]  Again, was in my stack here.
[00:03:38.562 --> 00:03:45.105]  Japan declares nuclear emergency after devastating earthquake and this could melt down like a Chernobyl.
[00:03:45.665 --> 00:03:52.988]  They still, according to the latest reports out just minutes ago, cannot get the coolant back into the reactor core.
[00:03:53.588 --> 00:03:54.808]  And then of course it can cause a
[00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:02.432]  China syndrome situation and it will blow sky-high ejecting radiation into the atmosphere.
[00:04:02.452 --> 00:04:04.873]  Of course in the past we were worried about this.
[00:04:06.154 --> 00:04:08.155]  In the past they didn't use DU in warfare.
[00:04:09.156 --> 00:04:20.842]  But now they do and the Pentagon four years ago and again last year said we may bomb the Bashir and other reactor sites in Iran with bunker busters that will eject
[00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.614]  The reactors are now operating and the centrifuges are operating.
[00:04:27.297 --> 00:04:31.763]  Both the purification facilities and some of the reactors are in the beginning stages of being fired up.
[00:04:32.224 --> 00:04:34.888]  That will then cause another Chernobyl type situation.
[00:04:34.928 --> 00:04:37.912]  But now, the government waves a magic wand and says,
[00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:41.050]  Carbon dioxide is bad for you.
[00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.632]  We've got to shut down all the power plants that are coal-powered.
[00:04:44.233 --> 00:04:45.374]  But radiation?
[00:04:46.315 --> 00:04:47.616]  Look at the naked body scanners.
[00:04:47.936 --> 00:04:50.178]  No OSHA, no radiation studies.
[00:04:50.378 --> 00:04:52.539]  They admit it's high-powered radiation.
[00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.202]  They just say, hey, it's good for the TSA, it's good for you.
[00:04:57.023 --> 00:04:59.345]  So, hey, this is nutritious what's happening.
[00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:04.919]  Tyranny is here.
[00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:08.901]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:05:09.121 --> 00:05:11.401]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:05:11.421 --> 00:05:16.863]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:05:17.283 --> 00:05:23.565]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:05:23.945 --> 00:05:29.507]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:05:29.927 --> 00:05:33.628]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:05:34.108 --> 00:05:38.089]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:43.931]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:05:44.331 --> 00:05:47.272]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:05:47.893 --> 00:05:49.313]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:05:49.853 --> 00:05:50.353]  It's here.

[00:06:59.295 --> 00:07:03.518]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:07:03.838 --> 00:07:04.439]  Number 1.
[00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:07.901]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:07:08.182 --> 00:07:08.722]  Number 2.
[00:07:09.042 --> 00:07:13.586]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:07:13.926 --> 00:07:14.366]  It's true.
[00:07:14.666 --> 00:07:19.230]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:20.090]  Number 3.
[00:07:20.371 --> 00:07:23.653]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:07:23.953 --> 00:07:27.656]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:07:27.856 --> 00:07:28.397]  Number 4.
[00:07:28.657 --> 00:07:31.019]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:07:31.419 --> 00:07:34.802]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:07:35.102 --> 00:07:35.303]  Number 5.
[00:07:35.883 --> 00:07:39.786]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:07:40.027 --> 00:07:44.791]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:07:45.071 --> 00:07:49.093]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:49.253 --> 00:07:50.793]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:51.034 --> 00:07:53.114]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:07:53.274 --> 00:07:55.876]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:07:55.896 --> 00:08:02.558]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:03.059 --> 00:08:05.860]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:33.161 --> 00:08:36.982]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, barely made it back in time.
[00:08:38.078 --> 00:08:57.094]  here because I was so busy working on guest but we do have a top astrophysicist who has one of the most accurate histories of being able to predict not just weather patterns but also tectonic activity.
[00:08:57.575 --> 00:09:02.139]  We've had him on before but will you please print me his bio ASAP so I can get that out.
[00:09:02.839 --> 00:09:27.081]  uh... for folks we're also uh... working on getting uh... mister corbett of the corporate reporter lives in japan who's an american living in japan uh... and who contributes to this broadcast joining us were unable to get a hold of him uh... in japan i'm gonna open the phones up for japanese living in japan americans living in japan germans living in japan anybody as long as you can speak english
[00:09:28.182 --> 00:09:33.065]  Please call into the show and give us your report on what's happening in Japan.
[00:09:34.006 --> 00:09:42.891]  Now, for those out there that just joined us, we're going to be looking in detail at the record 8.9 quake.
[00:09:43.311 --> 00:09:44.272]  And it's exponential.
[00:09:45.733 --> 00:09:47.854]  It doubles every time it goes up the scale.
[00:09:48.014 --> 00:09:49.775]  A 2 is a doubling of a 1.
[00:09:49.815 --> 00:09:50.356]  A 3 is a doubling of a 2.
[00:09:50.636 --> 00:09:51.456]  A 4 is a doubling of a 3.
[00:09:51.496 --> 00:09:51.817]  And up to 10.
[00:09:51.857 --> 00:09:52.457]  I mean, a 10.
[00:09:58.166 --> 00:10:06.135]  On the Richter scale is something out of a movie with the plate splitting apart and lava shooting 10,000 feet in the air.
[00:10:08.978 --> 00:10:15.246]  In fact, guys, just to illustrate this at a child-like level, will you go to YouTube and pull up Thundar the Barbarian?
[00:10:16.411 --> 00:10:17.491]  I think we even have that saved.
[00:10:17.511 --> 00:10:36.036]  I meant to play it joking a month ago about everybody saying Planet X is coming or a comet's coming on the 15th and total destruction is gonna rain and the hundreds of emails I get an hour and the feverish phone calls of people hyperventilating that they know I know the end of the world is coming in five days.
[00:10:36.657 --> 00:10:37.477]  What's the 15th?
[00:10:37.537 --> 00:10:40.238]  Is that next Wednesday or something?
[00:10:41.158 --> 00:10:41.438]  What day?
[00:10:42.844 --> 00:10:43.224]  Tuesday.
[00:10:43.505 --> 00:10:46.948]  I mean people are just completely freaking out thinking it's the end of the world.
[00:10:47.489 --> 00:10:49.271]  I'm not saying it's the end of the world.
[00:10:49.751 --> 00:10:53.595]  The media will take it out of context later and edit this together where I am saying that.
[00:10:54.256 --> 00:10:55.037]  But that's fine.
[00:10:55.737 --> 00:10:57.359]  The issue is it is kind of spooky.
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:08.742]  To have everybody calling up here, you know, saying the comet's coming the 15th, you're hiding in a bunker, you work for the New World Order, you know it's coming.
[00:11:08.782 --> 00:11:10.703]  No, I'm going to be here the 15th.
[00:11:10.743 --> 00:11:15.464]  I don't like to tempt fate and have a car wreck or something happens, but I'm going to be here.
[00:11:16.044 --> 00:11:17.644]  And I don't believe it's the end of the world.
[00:11:18.104 --> 00:11:20.165]  I don't believe that a comet is coming.
[00:11:20.725 --> 00:11:22.585]  I don't believe that we're all going to be killed.
[00:11:22.706 --> 00:11:24.286]  I don't believe an asteroid is coming.
[00:11:25.326 --> 00:11:38.658]  Uh, and just because Japan has been hit by a big earthquake, uh, the biggest in recorded, uh, modern science in the last hundred and so years that they've had Richter scales set up.
[00:11:39.519 --> 00:11:45.985]  Listen, there's a reason they build their houses out of paper and balsa wood in Japan.
[00:11:47.876 --> 00:11:53.662]  And that's because they get hit by record earthquakes there because they're on the Pacific Rim Great Ring of Fire.
[00:11:54.282 --> 00:12:00.488]  They're right where two big plates smash together.
[00:12:00.508 --> 00:12:01.969]  They have a lot of earthquakes in Chile.
[00:12:02.009 --> 00:12:04.772]  They have a lot of earthquakes in Peru.
[00:12:05.733 --> 00:12:08.576]  They have a lot of earthquakes in
[00:12:10.848 --> 00:12:13.933]  Hawaii, because they're all on hot spots.
[00:12:14.013 --> 00:12:21.486]  I mean, look, there's big giant tectonic plates, a couple miles thick, floating around on top of molten lava.
[00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:27.972]  And so, the only thing that is constant on this planet is change.
[00:12:28.572 --> 00:12:42.296]  I mean, it wasn't a comet, and it wasn't the Easter Bunny that caused Pompeii to be covered by Mount Vesuvius, and for thousands of Romans to be encased instantly in hot lava and burning ash.
[00:12:43.948 --> 00:12:47.512]  Okay, so these type of things happen.
[00:12:47.552 --> 00:12:49.574]  These type of things go on.
[00:12:49.934 --> 00:12:51.676]  These type of things unfold.
[00:12:52.277 --> 00:13:06.051]  And I'll bet you a million dollars that we're all still going to be here on the 16th of March and that a comet or Planet X or the Reptoid command ship, the Comet Empire, is not coming to get us.
[00:13:07.052 --> 00:13:07.812]  We do have Thundar.
[00:13:08.373 --> 00:13:10.914]  I'll bet you a million bucks, folks, hypothetically.
[00:13:10.934 --> 00:13:33.084]  I mean, obviously, I'm not literally betting you, but I'm going to be here next Tuesday, live on air, braving the runaway planet that is supposedly going to pull our atmosphere off and cause tectonic plates to be ejected thousands of feet in the air instantly, and lava shooting out, and the end of our civilization, and then thousands of years later, a super science
[00:13:33.544 --> 00:13:38.266]  The system rises with goblins flying around and Charlie Sheen warlocks.
[00:13:38.306 --> 00:13:38.846]  Here it is.
[00:13:42.007 --> 00:13:46.648]  Thundar, the Barbarian!
[00:13:46.888 --> 00:13:47.408]  The year 1994.
[00:13:47.468 --> 00:13:50.009]  From out of space comes a runaway planet.
[00:13:50.029 --> 00:13:51.890]  Hurtling between the Earth and the Moon.
[00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:59.292]  Unleashing cosmic destruction.
[00:13:59.332 --> 00:14:01.173]  Man's civilization is cast in ruin.
[00:14:06.472 --> 00:14:08.213]  2,000 years later, Earth is reborn.
[00:14:08.594 --> 00:14:10.555]  A strange new world rises from the old.
[00:14:10.976 --> 00:14:14.379]  A world of savagery, super science, and sorcery.
[00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:19.543]  But one man bursts his bonds to fight for justice.
[00:14:19.563 --> 00:14:28.611]  With his companions, Oofla the Mock and Princess Ariel, he fends his strength, his courage, and his fabulous sun sword against the forces of evil.
[00:14:33.732 --> 00:14:36.812]  He is Thundarr, the Barbarian!
[00:14:39.485 --> 00:14:41.187]  Well, that's a blast from the past.
[00:14:41.227 --> 00:14:55.740]  I remember being about five years old in Dallas watching that and loving it on television, because they only really had cartoons on Saturday mornings, so once a week my mom would let me watch cartoons and sit there eating Rice Krispies and scrambled eggs and watching Thundar the Barbarian.
[00:14:57.001 --> 00:15:00.304]  And see, in 1999 the comet didn't come and kill us.
[00:15:00.364 --> 00:15:00.464]  It's 2011.
[00:15:00.524 --> 00:15:01.585]  But comets do hit the Earth.
[00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:13.174]  And we can't trust the government to put a space-based weapon system up there to blast them because they would just use it as a weapon system against us here on the planet.
[00:15:14.895 --> 00:15:19.938]  But I'm going to try to walk through all this now and talk to James in Japan and others.
[00:15:20.998 --> 00:15:25.681]  If you just joined us here today,
[00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:33.502]  If you just joined us, obviously you know the big news.
[00:15:34.083 --> 00:15:34.923]  It's everywhere.
[00:15:37.545 --> 00:15:44.950]  But the different angle we're going to go with is what manipulates the inside of the Earth and its magnetic field.
[00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:55.236]  Well, it just so happens that two things coincided together in the last 48 hours or less, starting
[00:16:03.089 --> 00:16:11.460]  Wednesday morning, several different things happened and actually the Daily Mail is reporting on one of them.
[00:16:13.183 --> 00:16:19.051]  Is the Japanese earthquake the latest natural disaster to have been caused by the supermoon?
[00:16:20.421 --> 00:16:29.128]  The powerful tsunami that today slammed in Japan's eastern coast comes just two days after warnings that the movement of the moon could trigger unprecedented events.
[00:16:29.188 --> 00:16:34.372]  We have a leading solar physicist who particularly specializes in the moon joining us coming up.
[00:16:39.068 --> 00:16:46.318]  Sites predicted that the March 19th, a week tomorrow, the so-called supermoon will be closer to the Earth than any time since 1992.
[00:16:46.358 --> 00:16:49.182]  Only 221,567 miles away, and that this is a gravitational pull will bring chaos to Earth.
[00:16:56.303 --> 00:16:58.605]  And others predicted it as well.
[00:16:59.246 --> 00:17:02.569]  And we're going to be going over some of that, but the Daily Mail is reporting that.
[00:17:03.049 --> 00:17:07.854]  Also, we forget what hit us about 36 hours ago.
[00:17:08.734 --> 00:17:18.283]  And that was a massive solar flare that was directed right at the Earth and basically hit the
[00:17:19.756 --> 00:17:35.020]  Southern area of the planet, Antarctica blasting South Africa and Chile and other areas and there was some electronic problems and some interference with satellites reported in the last 36 hours.
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:38.021]  In fact, here's a report out of iAfrica.
[00:17:38.901 --> 00:17:40.842]  Solar flare warning in South Africa.
[00:17:41.462 --> 00:17:48.384]  The Hermannus Space Weather Warning Center on Sunday said a large solar flare was currently being
[00:17:49.284 --> 00:17:49.944]  Experienced.
[00:17:50.644 --> 00:17:55.305]  And then more flares again were fired in the next two days, hitting over the last four days.
[00:17:55.385 --> 00:17:57.165]  It takes about a day for those to get here.
[00:17:57.185 --> 00:18:06.207]  It takes seven minutes or so for the light to get here, but for the actual radiation that travels at a different speed, the flare itself, it can take two to three days.
[00:18:06.547 --> 00:18:07.487]  And so that's going on.
[00:18:07.507 --> 00:18:13.248]  You've got the Earth just being hit by these powerful magnetic fields and all sorts of different radiation in the wavelength.
[00:18:13.588 --> 00:18:15.149]  You've got the Moon close to the Earth.
[00:18:15.589 --> 00:18:16.249]  But don't worry!
[00:18:16.969 --> 00:18:20.931]  They're going to blame it on global warming or something, you can be assured of that.
[00:18:21.491 --> 00:18:23.132]  Now, I want to go to James in Japan.
[00:18:23.813 --> 00:18:26.714]  James in Japan, give us the report on what you're seeing, sir.
[00:18:28.255 --> 00:18:29.475]  Yeah, hi Alex, how are you?
[00:18:29.796 --> 00:18:30.536]  Good, good, go ahead.
[00:18:32.497 --> 00:18:37.039]  Well, it was a pretty devastating earthquake.
[00:18:37.139 --> 00:18:42.002]  I'm located in Tokyo, and even before the earthquake happened,
[00:18:42.455 --> 00:18:46.518]  This kind of comes back to what you're saying about some magnetic field or whatever.
[00:18:46.818 --> 00:18:48.239]  You felt something was wrong.
[00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:52.062]  I mean, there were no clouds in the sky and it started to rain.
[00:18:52.442 --> 00:18:53.723]  And I've never seen that before.
[00:18:53.803 --> 00:18:55.305]  It just got extremely hot.
[00:18:56.105 --> 00:18:59.848]  And then all of a sudden, I was, luckily I was in the park with my son.
[00:18:59.928 --> 00:19:01.149]  It was his birthday today.
[00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:05.752]  And I personally felt like I was having a convulsion.
[00:19:05.792 --> 00:19:10.596]  And I asked him, I said, either I'm having a convulsion or this, the Earth is,
[00:19:11.198 --> 00:19:13.360]  Like moving very, very hard.
[00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:15.421]  He says, Dad, I think we're going to die.
[00:19:16.302 --> 00:19:22.267]  And people in the park were running and there's like pretty much nowhere that they could run to.
[00:19:22.567 --> 00:19:25.009]  And it's a safe place, the park.
[00:19:25.089 --> 00:19:26.490]  I mean, it's away from buildings.
[00:19:27.236 --> 00:19:37.830]  But I personally have a, about a 1940 locomotive in the park and I took my son into that locomotive and it's solid steel.
[00:19:38.231 --> 00:19:40.094]  Well James, thank you for, stay there.
[00:19:40.194 --> 00:19:41.916]  No, don't thank me for...
[00:19:42.777 --> 00:19:44.438]  Having you on the show, thank you for calling.
[00:19:44.478 --> 00:19:44.799]  Stay there.
[00:19:44.819 --> 00:19:45.859]  We're going to go to break.
[00:19:45.899 --> 00:19:48.261]  Tell us more about what you saw unfold.
[00:19:48.622 --> 00:19:51.664]  We'll take other calls from Japan.
[00:19:51.684 --> 00:19:51.724]  800-259-9231.
[00:19:51.744 --> 00:19:51.804]  800-259-9231.
[00:19:51.824 --> 00:19:52.505]  Stay with us.
[00:20:00.276 --> 00:20:02.817]  If you suffer from poor sleep, you need MyPillow.

[00:21:05.787 --> 00:21:11.990]  We've told you about the video that details this shocking prediction.
[00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:15.771]  So far, over 6 million people have watched this free video online.
[00:21:16.011 --> 00:21:16.451]  Have you?
[00:21:16.811 --> 00:21:17.111]  Again.
[00:21:17.311 --> 00:21:20.112]  This big event has nothing to do with war or the stock market.
[00:21:20.393 --> 00:21:22.593]  Yet it could change everything about your normal way of life.
[00:21:22.893 --> 00:21:27.895]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your family.
[00:21:28.115 --> 00:21:29.136]  Could this really happen?
[00:21:29.296 --> 00:21:32.897]  Well, the man who created this video has been right about many predictions in his career.
[00:21:33.277 --> 00:21:39.341]  He was among the first to predict the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:21:39.541 --> 00:21:42.122]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:21:42.362 --> 00:21:45.624]  If you haven't taken time to watch this free video, do it right now.
[00:21:45.804 --> 00:21:47.906]  You may never think about America the same way again.

[00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:35.073]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:22:35.253 --> 00:22:40.957]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:22:41.057 --> 00:22:44.479]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[00:23:03.419 --> 00:23:07.209]  My name is Stan and I'm 68 years old and I live in Vermont.
[00:23:07.597 --> 00:23:12.081]  In the spring of 2003, I started to have problems with my heart.
[00:23:12.341 --> 00:23:14.282]  It felt like my heart was pounding.
[00:23:14.422 --> 00:23:15.724]  Made me feel breathless.
[00:23:16.144 --> 00:23:20.187]  I tried many, many different things to try to get some help for myself.
[00:23:20.587 --> 00:23:21.588]  Nothing did anything.
[00:23:21.668 --> 00:23:25.631]  Heart and Body Extract is very powerful, very effective, and works quickly.
[00:23:25.651 --> 00:23:29.094]  I saw one of Sharon's ads and ordered Heart and Body Extract.
[00:23:29.755 --> 00:23:32.417]  I noticed a difference quickly, within days.
[00:23:32.857 --> 00:23:37.461]  The episodes became less frequent and by a month had completely vanished.

[00:24:16.445 --> 00:24:19.046]  We're talking to James in Japan, got David waiting.
[00:24:20.067 --> 00:24:22.628]  Here's Richard Corbin, WeatherAction.com.
[00:24:23.169 --> 00:24:36.976]  He's a meteorologist, astrophysicist, consultant, owner of businesses, Weather Action, which even the mainstream media has had to admit because he's on record, predicted with over 90% certainty exactly what's going to happen with the weather a year out.
[00:24:37.316 --> 00:24:40.698]  Nobody else can do that because the main meteorologists don't follow the moon.
[00:24:41.673 --> 00:24:43.315]  The moon controls the oceans.
[00:24:43.395 --> 00:24:46.098]  It controls a lot of tectonic activity.
[00:24:46.138 --> 00:24:52.865]  It controls how much solar winds are hitting the earth as a shield when it's between the earth and the sun.
[00:24:54.157 --> 00:24:57.240]  It's a space wind tunnel out there.
[00:24:58.401 --> 00:25:00.903]  He's coming up to get into what could be triggering this.
[00:25:01.563 --> 00:25:03.745]  But let's talk to James in Japan.
[00:25:03.765 --> 00:25:05.607]  So, James, where are you in Japan?
[00:25:05.687 --> 00:25:06.487]  What did you witness?
[00:25:06.808 --> 00:25:10.591]  You and your son had to escape to the park, to the high ground.
[00:25:10.931 --> 00:25:11.452]  What happened?
[00:25:12.793 --> 00:25:20.279]  Yeah, well, we were in the park when it happened, so we escaped into an old locomotive they keep in the park for kids to see.
[00:25:21.059 --> 00:25:22.841]  And so we were pretty safe, fortunately.
[00:25:23.359 --> 00:25:32.202]  But what made this earthquake so different than others, which Japan has hit quite a bit by earthquakes, besides the intensity, was the length of it.
[00:25:32.622 --> 00:25:36.323]  I mean, this must have lasted about a minute and a half to two minutes.
[00:25:36.843 --> 00:25:39.084]  It was long and you just basically felt like...
[00:25:39.847 --> 00:25:40.468]  It was over.
[00:25:40.728 --> 00:25:41.448]  You're gonna die.
[00:25:41.549 --> 00:25:57.262]  Well, you know it was an 8.9, and we're showing video right now of houses, buildings, like Tinker Toys, just being pushed by the giant tsunami explosions.
[00:25:57.702 --> 00:25:58.943]  And I've got some bad news.
[00:25:58.983 --> 00:26:00.845]  I want you to continue, James, and go to David.
[00:26:01.466 --> 00:26:04.909]  Pressure is rising at the damaged Japanese nuclear power plant.
[00:26:05.749 --> 00:26:06.630]  Raising fears.
[00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:07.771]  It could melt down.
[00:26:08.091 --> 00:26:16.656]  How close are you to this particular nuclear reactor in this area of northeast of Tokyo?
[00:26:17.997 --> 00:26:22.080]  Well, that nuclear plant, that's maybe a few hundred miles away.
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:29.165]  But the bad news about it is the Japanese government, unfortunately, like the American government, never tells the truth all the time.
[00:26:29.445 --> 00:26:33.828]  When there was previously a nuclear leak, they never told you about it.
[00:26:34.364 --> 00:26:39.868]  And other leaks came out that they never told you about, even though employees were radiated and killed.
[00:26:40.408 --> 00:26:42.530]  So it could be worse than we're even being told.
[00:26:44.108 --> 00:26:47.851]  Absolutely, if you judge on what the government, how they lie.
[00:26:48.072 --> 00:26:49.313]  I'm going to be honest.
[00:26:49.473 --> 00:26:53.476]  I don't like giant nuclear facilities.
[00:26:53.516 --> 00:26:54.637]  They're too dangerous.
[00:26:55.358 --> 00:26:59.281]  And meanwhile, the environmentalists want them instead of coal.
[00:26:59.882 --> 00:27:01.183]  And coal is just fabulous.
[00:27:01.603 --> 00:27:05.527]  And now I've seen the greenies on TV, on C-SPAN.
[00:27:06.127 --> 00:27:10.771]  I'm absolutely concerned and what makes it even more devastating for people is there's been no phone service all day so it's
[00:27:31.184 --> 00:27:40.648]  If you weren't able to get home due to the fact that the trains have stopped in Tokyo, you can't even contact your family members to see if they're okay.
[00:27:41.188 --> 00:27:51.193]  I own a house, actually, two hours north, which is Oceanfront, and I can't even find out if my house was swept away by a tsunami.
[00:27:51.373 --> 00:27:55.635]  And for ignorant people that don't know, your regular phone service is out.
[00:27:55.675 --> 00:27:58.016]  You're calling us via computer phone?
[00:27:59.448 --> 00:28:01.608]  Yeah, I'm calling via Skype, Alex.
[00:28:01.969 --> 00:28:02.849]  Yeah, that's what we thought.
[00:28:03.529 --> 00:28:05.369]  People find contradictions when there are none.
[00:28:05.989 --> 00:28:09.930]  Well, sir, again, where are you on the map?
[00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:14.511]  And we'll put the name in and pull it up for people watching on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:28:14.531 --> 00:28:15.471]  What's the name of the town you're in?
[00:28:15.491 --> 00:28:23.233]  I'm in an area called Nakameguro in Meguro Ward in Tokyo.
[00:28:23.933 --> 00:28:27.934]  So you're in Tokyo, and how bad has Tokyo itself been hit?
[00:28:30.327 --> 00:28:38.149]  Well, there's been, uh, for example, there are water pipes that have burst in my building, and, uh, elevators don't work in any buildings.
[00:28:38.889 --> 00:28:43.991]  I had to run up nine flights of, uh, stairs to make sure my ex-wife and other son was okay.
[00:28:44.971 --> 00:28:51.833]  Um, there are people who, the, there's a convenience store in every block, and those are all full of people trying to, uh,
[00:28:53.182 --> 00:28:54.042]  We're good to go.
[00:29:13.086 --> 00:29:14.146]  Well, thank God, sir.
[00:29:14.266 --> 00:29:22.790]  Look, I'm stocked up on food, ammo, guns, and it's not that I live in fear, it's that I live empowered, and I don't want to live in fear.
[00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:26.551]  I would be afraid in my home at night if I didn't have firearms.
[00:29:26.591 --> 00:29:30.412]  I mean, what a... I can't imagine the domesticated, timid souls.
[00:29:30.452 --> 00:29:31.433]  David, we're going to go to you.
[00:29:32.677 --> 00:29:35.520]  Real fast on the other side, because it's live from Japan.
[00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:40.884]  We're going to go ahead and get this top meteorologist, Piers Richard Corbin, on as well at the same time with you.
[00:29:40.904 --> 00:29:46.489]  We're going to try to look at what could be triggering the massive increased tectonic activity the last two years.
[00:29:46.509 --> 00:29:48.411]  There's a lot more earthquakes happening, folks.
[00:29:48.631 --> 00:29:49.272]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:50.112 --> 00:29:51.013]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.494 --> 00:29:53.115]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.036 --> 00:29:56.698]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.945 --> 00:30:07.628]  Alex has told you that the Mideast uprisings over food prices and shortages caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide.
[00:30:07.989 --> 00:30:10.230]  We're seeing the impact right here in the United States.
[00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:19.454]  Ethanol, that was supposed to reduce petroleum use and fuel prices, hit a 30-month high in February, and pump prices are expected to reach $5 a gallon.
[00:30:19.694 --> 00:30:27.598]  Because of shipping costs, food is being priced out of the reach of millions of Americans, with an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days.
[00:30:27.958 --> 00:30:29.019]  Move quickly while you can
[00:30:29.019 --> 00:30:29.419]  I think so.
[00:30:59.401 --> 00:31:00.541]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:31:00.581 --> 00:31:07.244]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:31:07.504 --> 00:31:09.804]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:31:10.065 --> 00:31:15.266]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:31:15.446 --> 00:31:18.207]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:31:18.487 --> 00:31:20.548]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:31:20.788 --> 00:31:26.732]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:31:27.053 --> 00:31:30.255]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:31:30.415 --> 00:31:35.959]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:31:36.219 --> 00:31:37.520]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:39.021]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:31:39.141 --> 00:31:41.663]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:31:41.823 --> 00:31:45.865]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:31:46.025 --> 00:31:50.507]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:31:50.647 --> 00:31:53.108]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[00:31:53.248 --> 00:31:56.229]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:31:56.249 --> 00:31:56.869]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:32:01.035 --> 00:32:04.676]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:04.996 --> 00:32:13.119]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:32:13.859 --> 00:32:17.900]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:29.304]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:32:29.944 --> 00:32:38.952]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:39.453 --> 00:32:44.517]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:32:44.898 --> 00:32:52.084]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:52.384 --> 00:32:55.147]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:33:00.954 --> 00:33:01.356]  Yeah.
[00:33:15.524 --> 00:33:20.386]  All right, we have meteorologist Piers Richard Corbin, also astrophysicist.
[00:33:21.066 --> 00:33:23.967]  Two weeks before, and we're first going to a call from David in Japan.
[00:33:24.407 --> 00:33:25.008]  Two weeks!
[00:33:25.768 --> 00:33:30.490]  We have the ABC News article, Aaron's printing it right now, he found it during the break, from 2005.
[00:33:30.970 --> 00:33:35.332]  Two weeks before the last supermoon, that's when the moon is very close to the Earth.
[00:33:35.352 --> 00:33:37.472]  It's going to be the closest it's been to the Earth since 1992.
[00:33:40.918 --> 00:33:47.525]  That there is a clear connection with the moon being closer to Earth and tidal pull and super earthquakes and tsunamis.
[00:33:47.845 --> 00:33:49.647]  We know the moon controls the tides anyways.
[00:33:50.147 --> 00:33:56.714]  But we've got a true astrophysicist who specializes in lunar research joining us here in a moment.
[00:33:56.754 --> 00:33:58.335]  We also have record solar flares.
[00:33:59.711 --> 00:34:00.712]  Uh, hitting the Earth.
[00:34:01.052 --> 00:34:05.734]  ABC News is now asking today, did Supermoon cause 8.9 earthquake in Japan?
[00:34:05.934 --> 00:34:09.035]  So they just beat us to the article we're writing at InfoWars.com.
[00:34:09.055 --> 00:34:11.916]  We'll talk to Pierce Corbin, who's actually on a bus right now.
[00:34:12.277 --> 00:34:13.437]  We caught him on his cell phone.
[00:34:13.457 --> 00:34:17.359]  Uh, we'll talk to the astrophysicist here in a moment, who's also a meteorologist.
[00:34:17.839 --> 00:34:26.523]  Uh, but right now, quickly, David in Japan, James, who just called in, had to get to high ground with his son, and, uh, barely got away from the tsunami.
[00:34:26.803 --> 00:34:27.883]  Where are you in Japan?
[00:34:27.923 --> 00:34:28.964]  What can you tell us, David?
[00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:38.135]  I'm in Osaka, Japan, and I just wanted to say that on the local news reports we have here, they're reporting a lot of casualties.
[00:34:38.195 --> 00:34:42.277]  They're reporting it town by town, and it's 30 people here, 40 people there.
[00:34:42.937 --> 00:34:59.587]  It looks like there's going to be extremely high casualties from the tsunami, because it's not just like the earthquakes, because Japan generally is very well prepared, has very good building codes in terms of earthquakes, but there's just no preparing for the effect of the tsunami.
[00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:06.222]  Luckily, where I am here in Osaka, the effect of the tsunami wasn't too strong.
[00:35:06.262 --> 00:35:06.942]  We were shielded.
[00:35:07.022 --> 00:35:10.243]  But in Tokyo and up north, there's been terrible casualties.
[00:35:10.283 --> 00:35:17.065]  And they say in the town of Sendai that there's between 200 and 300 fatalities there.
[00:35:17.605 --> 00:35:20.606]  So it's probably going to go into the thousands, I think.
[00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:23.111]  Absolutely.
[00:35:23.831 --> 00:35:28.874]  Just like in the Indonesian situation that ended up killing over 200,000 for the first few hours.
[00:35:28.915 --> 00:35:29.195]  We heard 100, 200, 300.
[00:35:29.895 --> 00:35:33.998]  It's now above 300 dead in Japan.
[00:35:34.078 --> 00:35:42.123]  I would imagine from the devastating footage we've seen all over that coastal area of Japan where you just see hundreds of houses
[00:35:43.084 --> 00:35:53.934]  Just being slammed like, like, like paper boats and factories and airports just, just, just, just exploding into fire.
[00:35:54.754 --> 00:35:57.096]  This is absolutely incredible.
[00:35:57.176 --> 00:35:58.958]  We've got to be praying for everybody there.
[00:35:59.699 --> 00:36:04.183]  I would guess that the death toll is probably going to be in the tens of thousands, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:04.503 --> 00:36:07.706]  Anything else, David, that you can add to us for us from Japan?
[00:36:09.025 --> 00:36:12.609]  Yeah, in relation to the nuclear reactor, that was what I wanted to bring you about.
[00:36:12.649 --> 00:36:20.736]  The first reports that came out, they said that there was an explosion in the cooling system and they weren't able to control number one reactor.
[00:36:20.856 --> 00:36:27.943]  Actually, that area in Fukushima, where the nuclear reactor is, there's six nuclear reactors on the site.
[00:36:28.627 --> 00:36:31.668]  And they said they were able to shut down number four to six.
[00:36:32.228 --> 00:36:34.468]  Number two, the coolant system turned on properly.
[00:36:34.868 --> 00:36:37.389]  But number one, they were not able to turn on the coolant system.
[00:36:37.409 --> 00:36:40.269]  And they made a report about that.
[00:36:40.329 --> 00:36:41.750]  And then afterwards, they denied it.
[00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:45.350]  And now we're not sure what the situation is.
[00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:48.051]  Well, I've got the latest on that.
[00:36:48.111 --> 00:36:50.731]  Again, ABC News, Reuters as well.
[00:36:51.272 --> 00:36:57.093]  Pressure at damaged Japanese nuclear reactor rising with fears that there's no coolant going in.
[00:37:00.647 --> 00:37:02.029]  I mean, this is very serious.
[00:37:02.149 --> 00:37:13.524]  Earthquake-damaged Japanese nuclear reactor plant northeast of Tokyo has stoked fears of radioactive fallout unless the reactor core can be cooled and renewed concern about the security of other nuclear facilities in the tsunami's path.
[00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:19.252]  If it blows, it could actually cause the other reactors to blow.
[00:37:19.832 --> 00:37:21.453]  And as you said, there's six there.
[00:37:22.073 --> 00:37:24.034]  This is a gigantic facility.
[00:37:24.114 --> 00:37:26.995]  Japan, of course, gets most of its power, like France, from the nukes.
[00:37:27.695 --> 00:37:29.256]  And this is the problem with nukes, folks.
[00:37:29.316 --> 00:37:36.358]  I love technology, but, you know, if I could have a coal-powered plant that just puts out carbon dioxide and water vapor, I'd rather have it than a nuke.
[00:37:36.819 --> 00:37:38.439]  And Texas has got a bunch of nukes in it.
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:41.400]  And, well, thank you so much, David.
[00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:42.561]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[00:37:44.365 --> 00:37:45.426]  No, thanks Alex.
[00:37:45.446 --> 00:37:49.028]  We're listening here in Japan and you're having a big impact, so keep up the good work.
[00:37:49.088 --> 00:37:49.529]  Thanks a lot.
[00:37:49.849 --> 00:37:50.689]  Well, thank you, sir.
[00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:55.633]  Folks, we need to pray right now that they get the coolant into that thing.
[00:37:56.704 --> 00:37:57.946]  This is going to affect us too.
[00:37:57.986 --> 00:38:08.018]  If it melts down and explodes, it's going to eject incredibly radioactive isotopes right into the jet stream and they're going to orbit the Earth for the next four billion years or so.
[00:38:08.879 --> 00:38:13.805]  And Chernobyl devastated, you know, thousands of square miles in its path.
[00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:16.431]  This is devastating, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:17.211 --> 00:38:25.114]  Any way you slice it, what is Japan, the earthquake-prone capital of the world, doing with literally hundreds of nuclear reactors?
[00:38:25.134 --> 00:38:26.395]  Look up how many reactors they've got.
[00:38:26.435 --> 00:38:27.195]  I believe it's close to 100.
[00:38:27.255 --> 00:38:31.337]  Austin has two nuclear reactors in it.
[00:38:31.637 --> 00:38:34.938]  Giant research reactors up at the JJ Pickle facility.
[00:38:35.139 --> 00:38:37.340]  And I tell the idiot public this and they laugh at me.
[00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:42.942]  And by the way, we're on a fault line here with three dormant volcanoes we're sitting on top of.
[00:38:43.951 --> 00:38:45.734]  They're not extinct, a lot of evidence shows.
[00:38:45.754 --> 00:38:51.943]  Okay, I'm going to shut up now and go to our guest who joins us from the roads there in England.
[00:38:52.564 --> 00:38:58.733]  He's on the road, Piers Richard Corbin, meteorologist, astrophysicist, consultant, owner of Weather Action.
[00:38:59.714 --> 00:39:10.961]  And he's hailed by CNN, Fox, BBC as the only guy who can predict with over 90% accuracy, some say 86% accuracy, a year out what's going to happen.
[00:39:11.461 --> 00:39:15.223]  They got 55 operating the supply power and a bunch of other research facilities.
[00:39:16.444 --> 00:39:17.825]  52 light water, 55 overall.
[00:39:18.425 --> 00:39:22.208]  Mr. Corbin, again, what is your accuracy a year out?
[00:39:22.228 --> 00:39:23.388]  I forget the exact number.
[00:39:23.709 --> 00:39:27.231]  And give us your view on ABC and others saying,
[00:39:27.751 --> 00:39:31.094]  That did Supermoon cause 8.9 earthquake in Japan?
[00:39:31.415 --> 00:39:32.796]  What is a Supermoon, sir?
[00:39:34.618 --> 00:39:41.284]  Right, well our accuracy rate is 85% for extreme events forecasted many months ahead.
[00:39:41.784 --> 00:39:46.669]  And that's based on a combination of solar and lunar effects.
[00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:50.493]  A Supermoon is when
[00:39:51.366 --> 00:39:56.388]  The moon is closest to the Earth and there's also, it's also full on you.
[00:39:56.548 --> 00:40:05.610]  Basically, that type of, that situation gives you the strongest tidal effect.
[00:40:06.571 --> 00:40:11.872]  Now, the idea that the supermoon helps trigger earthquakes is absolutely correct.
[00:40:12.293 --> 00:40:16.394]  We agree with that and we know there is a lunar signal in
[00:40:17.774 --> 00:40:20.136]  And by the way, Doctor... I'm sorry I interrupted you.
[00:40:47.052 --> 00:40:49.335]  Sir, I interrupted you because there was a little bit of time delay.
[00:40:49.796 --> 00:40:50.317]  Repeat that.
[00:40:50.357 --> 00:40:56.885]  You're saying if there's lunar and solar together that there's evidence and that we did have both yesterday.
[00:40:57.085 --> 00:40:58.067]  Please repeat it in detail.
[00:40:58.792 --> 00:41:05.877]  Yes, what you need to get a big earthquake is a combination of lunar and solar effects.
[00:41:06.337 --> 00:41:17.385]  You need big events on the sun and then events, those events affect the solar wind and you need the solar wind coronal mass ejections to be directed to Earth.
[00:41:18.121 --> 00:41:25.587]  Well, sir, as a leading meteorologist and astrophysicist who specializes in lunar and solar study,
[00:41:46.271 --> 00:41:49.952]  There's a big debate raging right now with Discover Magazine.
[00:41:49.972 --> 00:41:52.473]  ABC says, did Supermoon cause 8.9?
[00:41:52.893 --> 00:41:57.135]  They're reporting this is the biggest supermoon since 1992.
[00:41:57.935 --> 00:42:00.476]  A, is that correct from your research?
[00:42:00.696 --> 00:42:05.138]  And some people... Yeah, well, it probably is correct.
[00:42:05.318 --> 00:42:08.479]  But, you know, you actually get quite a lot of lunar effect.
[00:42:08.559 --> 00:42:10.340]  I mean, the moon is closest to the Earth.
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:12.401]  We're good to go.
[00:42:30.496 --> 00:42:39.462]  So I think the details of how big isn't that important, just as long as you've got a significant moon and an extra hit from the sun.
[00:42:40.342 --> 00:42:44.785]  Because the earthquakes are things which are waiting to happen all the time, and it needs a trigger.
[00:42:45.306 --> 00:42:51.850]  And if it's triggered above a certain level, then they will come, and the combination of lunar and solar effects will give them.
[00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:53.931]  So the two magnify each other?
[00:42:53.951 --> 00:42:55.192]  That's right.
[00:42:56.488 --> 00:43:13.087]  How does the solar coronal ejection, several as you said last week hitting, a big one hitting yesterday, how does the lunar radiation and winds affect the tectonic activities?
[00:43:13.757 --> 00:43:17.401]  Right, well, we don't understand the details of how it all works.
[00:43:17.802 --> 00:43:24.970]  But we do know that when you get a coronal mass ejection hitting Earth, that there is a lot of geomagnetic activity.
[00:43:25.410 --> 00:43:28.233]  That is, the magnetic field of the Earth goes a bit wild.
[00:43:28.654 --> 00:43:31.317]  Now, that is connected to the Earth deep down.
[00:43:31.697 --> 00:43:31.897]  So,
[00:43:33.099 --> 00:43:46.159]  You know, changes in that does involve forces, and that could encourage or tip the balance, which allows the tectonic plate to move that little bit, but it is trying to go anyway.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:57.903]  So all we know is that throughout history there have been, even the ancients obviously knew this, they didn't know why, that the moon and the sun do tend to affect volcanoes and things like that.
[00:44:00.323 --> 00:44:10.045]  Obviously, if the moon itself is what creates the tides coming in and out, then certainly the sun is going to have an effect.
[00:44:10.306 --> 00:44:11.266]  But the UN said
[00:44:12.767 --> 00:44:20.964]  About a year and a half ago at the Copenhagen Summit, they said the sun has no effect on climate.
[00:44:22.774 --> 00:44:23.354]  Well, it would.
[00:44:23.374 --> 00:44:29.636]  The trouble is the whole of science has been corrupted by this CO2 nonsense.
[00:44:29.856 --> 00:44:51.261]  But before wasting any more time on that, I would just like to say a very interesting thing about the solar effect, is that the biggest storms and the biggest earthquakes tend to come, curiously, when the solar activity on average is low, that is in solar minima, especially the order to even minima, like we're now moving into or in.
[00:44:52.071 --> 00:44:52.391]  Thank you.
[00:45:11.353 --> 00:45:31.054]  A lot of littler, smaller earthquakes rather than single big ones which seem to happen around the solar minima, especially the odd to even minima, which is all quite interesting and kind of understandable when you think about, you know, shaking up rocks or shaking sugar out of a jar and so on, you know.
[00:45:32.326 --> 00:45:36.748]  It'll stick and then come out in lumps.
[00:45:37.188 --> 00:45:41.410]  Except when you have lots of little wobbles, then it doesn't come out in lumps.
[00:45:41.490 --> 00:45:43.950]  That type of analogy helps us understand it anyway.
[00:45:44.231 --> 00:45:44.651]  Yes, sir.
[00:45:44.671 --> 00:45:49.453]  We're talking to meteorologist and astrophysicist Piers Richard Corbin.
[00:45:49.893 --> 00:45:54.294]  You can check out his very important website at weatheraction.com.
[00:45:54.334 --> 00:45:55.575]  But, sir, I specifically
[00:45:56.175 --> 00:45:57.276]  brought up the U.N.
[00:45:57.356 --> 00:46:07.346]  because as you know with the earthquake in Haiti and some of the other earthquakes, Al Gore and others have come out, the U.N.
[00:46:07.386 --> 00:46:12.291]  has come out and they have said that the earthquake is caused by global warming.
[00:46:13.192 --> 00:46:31.686]  From my research, but correct me if I'm wrong, there's really no evidence connecting CO2 in the slow average to any type of big event, but we do have direct connections to solar and lunar events, so they're telling us the sun has no effect, so they can blame it all on humans and taxes.
[00:46:32.366 --> 00:46:32.706]  That's right.
[00:46:32.766 --> 00:46:36.609]  They are mad, they are fools, they are charlatans, they are liars.
[00:46:37.250 --> 00:46:44.956]  And if you want to know more, hop on our website where we put up a thing at weatheraction.com on this very point.
[00:46:45.076 --> 00:46:51.942]  It's labelled under comments from me, the most recent comment from me on weatheraction.com.
[00:46:53.630 --> 00:46:54.231]  Absolutely.
[00:46:54.871 --> 00:47:03.597]  In closing, sir, and obviously you go over the science, you go over the math, 85% accuracy in your catastrophic predictions.
[00:47:03.917 --> 00:47:09.221]  I've seen the press report above 90 in some of the closer-in predictions, not just a year out.
[00:47:09.581 --> 00:47:11.983]  The proof is in the pudding in the last two years.
[00:47:12.683 --> 00:47:15.327]  Well, no, no, it's just, no, I mean, no brag, just facts, sir.
[00:47:15.347 --> 00:47:16.889]  I mean, you obviously know what you're talking about.
[00:47:17.269 --> 00:47:24.178]  But, you know, you say it's more of an art form looking at the history and then projecting forward almost to dead reckoning.
[00:47:24.618 --> 00:47:31.086]  Dead reckoning with the big record solar flare, the, you know, the huge moon.
[00:47:31.827 --> 00:47:32.807]  Uh, the supermoon.
[00:47:33.147 --> 00:47:34.548]  What does your gut tell you?
[00:47:34.568 --> 00:47:45.031]  I mean, does your gut tell you, doctor, that, that, uh, this, this was probably triggered, uh, or pushed over the edge by the supermoon and the coronal mass ejection?
[00:47:45.311 --> 00:47:47.011]  Yes, yes, we would say that.
[00:47:47.071 --> 00:47:53.053]  We say this thing was caused by events on the sun or rather solar, a solar lunar combination.
[00:47:53.333 --> 00:48:00.715]  And I put out a tweet to that effect with the link and, uh, my tweet address is peers underscore Corbyn.
[00:48:01.335 --> 00:48:03.236]  Spelled T-O-R-B-Y-N.
[00:48:03.576 --> 00:48:06.637]  So if anyone goes on there, they can get all the links straight away.
[00:48:06.777 --> 00:48:08.157]  Well, sir, we'll follow you.
[00:48:08.177 --> 00:48:13.219]  Hopefully you'll follow us at twitter.com forward slash realalexjones.
[00:48:13.259 --> 00:48:17.781]  We're just now getting on the Twitter bandwagon to reach folks because it's so effective.
[00:48:18.241 --> 00:48:21.142]  Well, sir, we'll talk to you again in the very near future.
[00:48:21.182 --> 00:48:22.602]  Anything else that you'd like to add?
[00:48:22.622 --> 00:48:23.883]  No, that's fine.
[00:48:23.923 --> 00:48:27.484]  It's superb to come on your show.
[00:48:28.464 --> 00:48:29.265]  Good to have you, doctor.
[00:48:30.326 --> 00:48:35.150]  Okay, there goes meteorologist and astrophysicist, doctor of astrophysics.
[00:48:35.931 --> 00:48:41.076]  By the way, that guy's literally about 180 IQ, so we appreciate him joining us.
[00:48:42.397 --> 00:48:45.900]  And you heard him, just complete fraud, complete scam, complete joke.
[00:48:46.581 --> 00:48:53.688]  And look for Danny Glover, look for Al Gore, look for the UN, Pachari, to now say this was global warming.
[00:48:54.568 --> 00:48:58.409]  Was it global warming 800 years ago in Japan when they had earthquakes and tsunamis?
[00:48:59.750 --> 00:49:00.850]  No, it was the sun and the moon.
[00:49:03.151 --> 00:49:05.572]  Yeah, there's a gigantic planetoid spinning around us.
[00:49:05.912 --> 00:49:07.413]  It controls the weather.
[00:49:07.673 --> 00:49:10.154]  Just to give you a little newsflash, with the sun.
[00:49:10.754 --> 00:49:19.958]  It's a 100% fact, and they sit there like the Vatican 500, 600 years ago, telling you still that the Earth was the center of the universe.
[00:49:20.819 --> 00:49:21.099]  Okay?
[00:49:21.839 --> 00:49:31.442]  This is as ridiculous or more to have the United Nations in 2011 telling us that the sun and the moon do not affect climate.
[00:49:31.642 --> 00:49:32.682]  That it's all us.
[00:49:33.943 --> 00:49:34.623]  Baloney.
[00:49:35.203 --> 00:49:35.823]  Baloney.
[00:49:36.503 --> 00:49:44.105]  Oh, they're worried about those coal power plants they want to shut down so they can build their nuclear plants because then only insiders can get the permits.
[00:49:45.406 --> 00:49:46.346]  Like General Electric.
[00:49:47.378 --> 00:49:48.658]  I don't want nuclear plants.
[00:49:49.018 --> 00:49:49.818]  I'm not against it.
[00:49:49.858 --> 00:49:51.219]  If it's all we had, use it.
[00:49:51.639 --> 00:49:54.099]  But it is on the last of my list.
[00:49:54.739 --> 00:49:59.700]  If you want to have deep space spacecraft going out of orbit with it, still dangerous to get it up into orbit.
[00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:04.701]  But if they had some safe way to do it, nuke makes a lot of sense in orbit.
[00:50:05.681 --> 00:50:06.542]  Or out of orbit.
[00:50:09.582 --> 00:50:13.783]  Aircraft carriers, they have a safer history with smaller ones.
[00:50:15.311 --> 00:50:16.431]  At least it's out in the ocean.
[00:50:17.812 --> 00:50:20.273]  Subs, we know there's been a bunch of disasters they cover up.
[00:50:20.613 --> 00:50:21.153]  We know this.
[00:50:21.293 --> 00:50:30.295]  Universities have radiation detectors all over the world and we know that radiation just goes up and up and up and there's all sorts of leaks and all sorts of cover-ups and storing the waste.
[00:50:30.555 --> 00:50:30.996]  I'm done.
[00:50:31.356 --> 00:50:31.796]  I'm done.
[00:50:31.816 --> 00:50:32.576]  I'm done.
[00:50:33.076 --> 00:50:38.858]  They're talking about this reactor blowing up
[00:50:40.753 --> 00:50:42.094]  The temperature's rising.
[00:50:42.854 --> 00:50:44.315]  They can't get coolant into it.
[00:50:44.695 --> 00:50:46.776]  It's one of six reactors at the same facility.
[00:50:48.477 --> 00:50:50.018]  It melts down, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:50.878 --> 00:50:53.980]  You think large areas of Japan on fire right now is bad?
[00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:57.781]  Pray, pray, pray that the coolant gets into that reactor.
[00:50:58.262 --> 00:50:58.602]  Be back.
[00:51:00.529 --> 00:51:04.993]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:51:45.997 --> 00:51:46.217]  That's 1-877-886-3653.
[00:51:46.257 --> 00:51:46.497]  Or order
[00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:55.282]  We're good to go.
[00:52:04.790 --> 00:52:05.050]  I don't know.
[00:52:24.952 --> 00:52:25.633]  We're good to go.
[00:52:40.189 --> 00:52:40.649]  I don't know.
[00:53:00.526 --> 00:53:03.468]  Forget everything you've been told about long-term food storage.
[00:53:03.728 --> 00:53:10.934]  When the collapse happens, you'll need the single most effective way to get high-powered Delta Force nutrients to your family fast.
[00:53:11.834 --> 00:53:14.556]  Like any Special Forces commando, you need a plan.
[00:53:14.937 --> 00:53:17.178]  You need a Black Hawk Down food plan.
[00:53:17.459 --> 00:53:20.601]  Introducing the Survival Sprout Bank from Solutions from Science.
[00:53:20.881 --> 00:53:22.642]  It's your countertop survival garden.
[00:53:22.923 --> 00:53:27.126]  Yes, grow fresh greens right on your countertop in just a few short days.

[00:53:43.975 --> 00:53:46.497]  That's 877-327-0365 or order online at survivalsproutbank.com.
[00:53:46.537 --> 00:53:47.517]  Survival Sprout Bank.
[00:53:56.502 --> 00:53:58.846]  Your Black Hawk Town Emergency Food Plan!
[00:54:11.131 --> 00:54:25.731]  Well, here it's fine If you've got the time And the time to get yourself in And here it's time
[00:54:27.753 --> 00:54:40.623]  Okay, we have Twitter intel flooding in at twitter.com forward slash realalexjones.
[00:54:41.124 --> 00:54:43.606]  You know, we got a Twitter account nine, ten months ago.
[00:54:44.106 --> 00:54:45.488]  We actually have three or four of them.
[00:54:46.048 --> 00:54:47.749]  A total of about eighty, ninety thousand.
[00:54:48.630 --> 00:54:49.210]  All together.
[00:54:49.271 --> 00:54:51.672]  We just kind of use it as a news feed to get the word out.
[00:54:51.992 --> 00:54:56.615]  But really, it's designed for you, the listeners, to give us intel, to give us heads up.
[00:54:57.576 --> 00:55:04.180]  I'm trying to Twitter every day, you know, not just lean over Matt Ryan's shoulder and say, hey, send a photo out to folks or tell them this is coming up.
[00:55:04.481 --> 00:55:06.822]  You know, I'm actually, you know, Twittering to you myself.
[00:55:07.202 --> 00:55:08.683]  We're sending more and more things out.
[00:55:09.224 --> 00:55:18.430]  But really, that's just so folks are interested in it so we can get the information from you when things are happening or when I'm at a demonstration and the cops are beating people up.
[00:55:19.150 --> 00:55:21.851]  I can send it out to 100, 200, 300,000 people.
[00:55:21.911 --> 00:55:22.511]  Hey, we're here.
[00:55:22.851 --> 00:55:23.472]  We need help.
[00:55:23.932 --> 00:55:26.733]  That's why I want to get this one Twitter account up to 100,000.
[00:55:26.793 --> 00:55:30.194]  I need it to be 100,000 to have any real punch.
[00:55:30.554 --> 00:55:34.675]  We've dominated YouTube, dominated Google, 300 million views on YouTube.
[00:55:35.476 --> 00:55:41.858]  We've dominated, you know, so many other areas, but we've not even, I mean, I'm the one that got Charlie Sheen to do his Twitter account.
[00:55:42.518 --> 00:55:51.986]  I'm the guy that twisted his arm and said, communicate directly, don't communicate through text to TMZ, who then censors what you're doing and what you're saying.
[00:55:53.447 --> 00:55:59.292]  If you can get through from Japan, it's twitter.com forward slash realalexjones.
[00:55:59.632 --> 00:56:00.232]  You can call us at 800-259-9231.
[00:56:00.252 --> 00:56:00.292]  800-259-9231.
[00:56:00.313 --> 00:56:02.955]  I was going to have Pharmacist Ben Fuchs back on, talking about
[00:56:12.236 --> 00:56:12.396]  Yes.
[00:56:31.039 --> 00:56:44.603]  And I don't want to do it again today, so he'll be on this about 30 minutes to the next hour, but he'll also give us his take on the situation with the earthquake and the tsunami and the 8.9 and the reactor on the verge of melting down and just all of this insanity.
[00:56:45.083 --> 00:56:47.944]  But if you are in Japan, 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231, and we will get you up and on the air.
[00:56:47.964 --> 00:56:49.024]  If you have trouble,
[00:56:58.871 --> 00:57:00.892]  Calling a 1-800 number.
[00:57:03.833 --> 00:57:05.934]  John, give me a Genesis.
[00:57:06.974 --> 00:57:08.915]  Can I put a Genesis regular number up?
[00:57:08.935 --> 00:57:10.195]  Do we have one of those that's available?
[00:57:10.975 --> 00:57:15.397]  Only because my regular call guy is working on some IT stuff in another department today.
[00:57:15.817 --> 00:57:22.460]  We can probably drag him in here and I can give out our number, our local number, because sometimes people can't call foreign into a 1-800 number.
[00:57:23.220 --> 00:57:26.181]  Harmon, up at Genesis, do you have a regular number I can give out for
[00:57:28.174 --> 00:57:32.017]  Okay, well just give it to me verbally then and I'll just give it out on air right now.
[00:57:35.581 --> 00:57:37.402]  Send it to me on IM just to make sure I'm right.
[00:57:40.505 --> 00:57:44.949]  Now here's the type of stuff we're getting from Japan at twitter.com realalexjones.
[00:57:45.449 --> 00:57:46.870]  Excellent, thanks for the heads up.
[00:57:49.798 --> 00:57:52.700]  Ordered an autographed copy and a couple of t-shirts while I was at it.
[00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:53.820]  Oh, that was a Twitter.
[00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:54.841]  That's the wrong stack.
[00:57:55.241 --> 00:57:58.483]  I was just given a stack earlier of Twitter comments from Japan.
[00:57:58.923 --> 00:58:00.904]  So I don't know why that one's there.
[00:58:04.565 --> 00:58:07.608]  We just got in a bunch of autographed Jesse Ventura books.
[00:58:08.188 --> 00:58:10.830]  Forty-five of them, and then that's it if you want them.
[00:58:11.971 --> 00:58:13.292]  And I also autographed them.
[00:58:13.312 --> 00:58:17.456]  There's a photo up on Twitter of me autographing the Jesse Ventura autograph.
[00:58:17.516 --> 00:58:20.098]  Sixty-three documents the government doesn't want you to have.
[00:58:20.118 --> 00:58:21.279]  In fact, here it is.
[00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:24.021]  But I'll get all those Twitters.
[00:58:24.061 --> 00:58:28.545]  I'll find those Twitters from the tsunami victim folks out there.
[00:58:31.348 --> 00:58:32.568]  And the reactor situation.
[00:58:32.588 --> 00:58:34.269]  Let me compose myself, refocus.
[00:58:34.789 --> 00:58:36.030]  So much is going on here.
[00:58:36.370 --> 00:58:38.191]  InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:58:38.211 --> 00:58:47.334]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:50.979 --> 00:58:54.600]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:58:55.001 --> 00:58:58.002]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:58:58.242 --> 00:59:03.004]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:59:03.024 --> 00:59:09.226]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:59:09.426 --> 00:59:14.447]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:59:14.607 --> 00:59:16.388]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:59:16.428 --> 00:59:17.708]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:59:17.728 --> 00:59:20.769]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:59:31.112 --> 00:59:32.954]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:59:33.234 --> 00:59:38.018]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:59:38.378 --> 00:59:48.327]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:59:52.691 --> 00:59:54.633]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.073 --> 00:59:57.856]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:04.502 --> 01:00:08.706]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.326 --> 01:00:10.147]  You want answers?
[01:00:10.908 --> 01:00:11.829]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.449 --> 01:00:16.132]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.653 --> 01:00:20.717]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.202 --> 01:00:26.044]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are live into hour number two.
[01:00:26.705 --> 01:00:38.392]  If you're trying to call in from Japan and you can't call our 1-800 number, 800-259-9231, you're welcome to call, but normal listeners do not call this number.
[01:00:38.412 --> 01:00:39.372]  It's only a few lines.
[01:00:40.413 --> 01:00:41.574]  You already heard James earlier.
[01:00:41.594 --> 01:00:51.023]  He and his son had to run to high ground at a local park and climb up onto an old engine, an old train engine, there for the kids to play on, to get away from the water.
[01:00:52.003 --> 01:00:59.650]  This is for people in Japan or folks, I guess, in Oregon who've been told to evacuate on the coastline or folks in Hawaii.
[01:00:59.710 --> 01:01:02.052]  People affected by the earthquake, by the tsunami.
[01:01:02.773 --> 01:01:03.373]  6-5-1-6-9-5-7-7-7-7-7-6-5-1-6-9-5-7-7-7-7-6-5-1-6-9-5-7-7-7-7.
[01:01:03.414 --> 01:01:07.337]  Now, we are having a whole bunch of tweets come in, a whole bunch of questions.
[01:01:07.357 --> 01:01:13.001]  I'm going to be going over tweets, you know, the one-line communiques, kind of modern telegrams from Tokyo.
[01:01:29.329 --> 01:01:31.210]  Oh no, they say he's got to go.
[01:01:31.370 --> 01:01:32.950]  Godzilla.
[01:01:34.311 --> 01:01:35.732]  Oh no, there goes Tokyo.
[01:01:35.792 --> 01:01:38.253]  I mean, it reminds me of the Blue Oyster Cult or something.
[01:01:38.873 --> 01:01:41.334]  That's why the Japanese are so into things like Godzilla.
[01:01:41.794 --> 01:01:48.937]  They're constantly having earthquakes, constantly having tsunamis, and Godzilla is an archetype of that.
[01:01:49.722 --> 01:01:51.823]  Oh no, there goes Tokyo, Godzilla.
[01:01:52.264 --> 01:01:53.645]  It's really Mother Nature.
[01:01:53.705 --> 01:01:54.185]  It's God.
[01:01:54.645 --> 01:01:55.306]  It's the system.
[01:01:55.906 --> 01:01:56.546]  It's the planet.
[01:01:57.307 --> 01:02:03.310]  And I'm getting hundreds and hundreds of tweets, hundreds of harp tweets is what they're called, saying, was this harp?
[01:02:03.350 --> 01:02:03.991]  Was this harp?
[01:02:04.291 --> 01:02:04.851]  Was this harp?
[01:02:05.272 --> 01:02:06.793]  I don't know if this was harp.
[01:02:07.673 --> 01:02:14.357]  But harp is the god of this world, the new world order, the little devil system trying to play God.
[01:02:14.938 --> 01:02:15.758]  Secretary of Defense 1990
[01:02:18.943 --> 01:02:20.084]  I don't think so.
[01:02:43.012 --> 01:02:44.154]  It's Tesla technology.
[01:02:45.717 --> 01:02:49.564]  And we know Israel's even in a wretch a few years ago developing earthquake weapons.
[01:02:50.045 --> 01:02:51.027]  Other governments have them.
[01:02:51.568 --> 01:02:53.511]  So yes, this could be that.
[01:02:53.852 --> 01:02:54.573]  But don't forget...
[01:02:55.828 --> 01:03:03.234]  You know, the New World Order and the little devil New World Order with his little pitchfork, he's about the size of an atom compared to the universe.
[01:03:04.214 --> 01:03:10.199]  The sun, the moon, don't be so proud of this technological terror you've constructed.
[01:03:10.879 --> 01:03:20.707]  The ability to use a harp magnetic weapon and manipulate the weather or the tectonic plates is insignificant next to the power of the sun and the moon.
[01:03:22.196 --> 01:03:22.376]  Okay?
[01:03:22.817 --> 01:03:25.459]  To paraphrase Darth Vader on board the Death Star.
[01:03:26.060 --> 01:03:36.090]  So, I want to hear from people in Japan or in Hawaii where they did get hit by some bigger waves, some moderate tsunami stuff.
[01:03:36.610 --> 01:03:40.354]  We got Sheldon in Japan coming up after the break and others.
[01:03:40.374 --> 01:03:40.414]  651-695-7777.
[01:03:46.149 --> 01:03:50.830]  Only folks on Skype really are able to call in on the toll-free, but regular landline folks can call that 651-695-7777.
[01:03:50.950 --> 01:04:03.474]  Again, for listeners that are ignorant about telecommunications, who think I'm being mean to folks in Japan, sometimes you can't call from foreign countries to 1-800, so I don't mean for you to have to pay for it yourself.
[01:04:03.814 --> 01:04:05.735]  But I'll go to your calls directly after this break.
[01:04:06.055 --> 01:04:07.756]  I'd go to you now, but I don't want to cut you short.
[01:04:08.196 --> 01:04:10.636]  And we are getting your Twitter questions that are pouring in lined up.
[01:04:11.077 --> 01:04:13.157]  Twitter.com forward slash RealAlexJones.
[01:04:13.917 --> 01:04:15.578]  Continuing to get them that way as well.
[01:04:18.004 --> 01:04:21.085]  The websites are PrisonPlanet.tv and FallWars.com.
[01:04:21.485 --> 01:04:24.407]  We'll continue to report on this with Bob Chapman joining us.
[01:04:24.727 --> 01:04:35.031]  We'll also hit on the big moves to devalue the dollar worldwide, what's happening in commodities, the biggest investment fund getting out of the US dollar yesterday, US T-bills.
[01:04:37.816 --> 01:04:45.758]  While we're busy watching all this, Gaddafi's winning a bunch of battles and retaking many areas, many towns and cities taken by globalist black forces.
[01:04:45.778 --> 01:04:47.539]  I'm not saying that's a good thing.
[01:04:47.559 --> 01:04:50.360]  I don't like Gaddafi, but he's a smaller demon compared to the globalists.
[01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:56.421]  And so now there's an open talk about full invasion since their rebel forces aren't winning for them via proxy.
[01:04:56.762 --> 01:04:57.242]  Stay with us.
[01:04:57.282 --> 01:04:58.002]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:04:59.721 --> 01:05:03.964]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:04.284 --> 01:05:04.544]  Number 1.
[01:05:05.185 --> 01:05:08.347]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:08.607 --> 01:05:09.167]  Number 2.
[01:05:09.468 --> 01:05:14.031]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:14.371 --> 01:05:14.811]  It's true.
[01:05:15.111 --> 01:05:19.674]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:19.995 --> 01:05:20.515]  Number 3.
[01:05:20.815 --> 01:05:24.097]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:24.397 --> 01:05:28.100]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:31.461]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:31.841 --> 01:05:35.222]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:35.522 --> 01:05:40.243]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:05:40.463 --> 01:05:45.225]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:05:45.525 --> 01:05:49.546]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:49.686 --> 01:05:51.247]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:51.487 --> 01:05:56.308]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call one
[01:05:56.548 --> 01:05:56.908]  877-327-0365.
[01:05:59.571 --> 01:06:00.712]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:06:00.752 --> 01:06:07.418]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:06:07.679 --> 01:06:09.961]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:06:10.241 --> 01:06:15.406]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:06:15.586 --> 01:06:18.388]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:06:18.648 --> 01:06:20.749]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:06:20.949 --> 01:06:26.892]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:06:27.212 --> 01:06:30.414]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:06:30.594 --> 01:06:36.117]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:06:36.377 --> 01:06:37.678]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:06:38.018 --> 01:06:39.219]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:06:39.299 --> 01:06:41.820]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:46.022]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:06:46.202 --> 01:06:50.685]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:06:50.825 --> 01:06:53.266]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[01:06:53.406 --> 01:06:57.108]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:06:57.268 --> 01:06:58.269]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:07:00.538 --> 01:07:07.219]  Alex has told you that the Mideast uprisings over food prices and shortages caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide.
[01:07:07.559 --> 01:07:09.800]  We're seeing the impact right here in the United States.
[01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:15.601]  Ethanol, that was supposed to reduce petroleum use and fuel prices, hit a 30-month high in February.
[01:07:15.901 --> 01:07:19.041]  And pump prices are expected to reach $5 a gallon.
[01:07:19.261 --> 01:07:27.183]  Because of shipping costs, food is being priced out of the reach of millions of Americans, with an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days.
[01:07:27.523 --> 01:07:29.303]  Move quickly while you can still afford it.
[01:07:29.563 --> 01:07:30.063]  We're good.
[01:07:59.878 --> 01:08:04.781]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:05.141 --> 01:08:07.462]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:08.783 --> 01:08:11.605]  You notice that just all of a sudden everything's going haywire.
[01:08:12.245 --> 01:08:14.366]  Things are just going to accelerate from here on out.
[01:08:14.866 --> 01:08:16.347]  The New World Order is coming in.
[01:08:17.128 --> 01:08:24.152]  You got Sarkozy openly saying invade, bomb Libya because now they're
[01:08:25.219 --> 01:08:27.341]  Globalist-backed rebels are not winning.
[01:08:27.661 --> 01:08:29.582]  They've got to keep the domino effect going.
[01:08:30.323 --> 01:08:31.624]  The tweets are pouring in.
[01:08:31.644 --> 01:08:43.732]  Twitter.com forward slash real Alex Jones saying Obama's giving a speech right now saying that they're going to go ahead with a humanitarian cover and invade through NATO.
[01:08:47.509 --> 01:08:47.990]  Libya.
[01:08:48.310 --> 01:08:50.011]  Ron Paul's calling it an act of war.
[01:08:50.052 --> 01:08:52.134]  Well, what do you think blockades and invasions are?
[01:08:52.154 --> 01:09:06.708]  It's like last week, I guess on Monday now, not even last week, Senator Kerry's saying, well, you know, we need to bomb their airfields and do a blockade, but we don't need to have any invasion or any act of war.
[01:09:07.967 --> 01:09:09.168]  Or any military action.
[01:09:09.889 --> 01:09:10.810]  Yeah, there it is.
[01:09:10.830 --> 01:09:11.290]  AP.
[01:09:11.410 --> 01:09:12.391]  Obama says U.S.
[01:09:12.471 --> 01:09:13.913]  is tightening noose on Libyan leader.
[01:09:14.293 --> 01:09:21.340]  President Barack Obama said Friday that a no-fly zone over Libya to keep Colonel Muammar Qaddafi from attacking rebels remains a possibility.
[01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:23.742]  And we are slowly tightening the noose around Qaddafi.
[01:09:23.782 --> 01:09:25.844]  Really is Qaddafi won a bunch of battles today.
[01:09:26.405 --> 01:09:29.568]  But he stopped short of moving toward military action.
[01:09:29.588 --> 01:09:30.348]  The bottom line is
[01:09:31.551 --> 01:09:35.872]  I have not taken any actions off the table at this point, Obama told White House News Conference.
[01:09:35.892 --> 01:09:42.214]  Yeah, they'd rather have the rebels they have backed get control, instead of having to have another war, but they're certainly happy to have it.
[01:09:42.594 --> 01:09:43.754]  Now, again, that's going on.
[01:09:44.394 --> 01:09:54.557]  The dollar is moving towards being de-pegged right now, with the Chinese attacking it, the G20 attacking it, the biggest bond investment fund in the world saying they're not buying dollars anymore, just devastating.
[01:09:55.834 --> 01:10:00.076]  You got the tsunami, earthquake, 8.9 biggest in the hundred-plus years.
[01:10:00.116 --> 01:10:03.578]  They've been recording Richter scale activity in that area of the Pacific.
[01:10:04.279 --> 01:10:08.121]  They're now reporting over a thousand dead, and it's going to be 10,000 and then 20,000.
[01:10:08.261 --> 01:10:10.562]  I mean, this is super bad news.
[01:10:10.603 --> 01:10:18.367]  And when you see whole areas of cities with houses and buildings just being pushed by giant waves, people are being crushed and cut up in there, folks.
[01:10:18.847 --> 01:10:19.288]  I mean, this is
[01:10:20.745 --> 01:10:21.766]  This is devastating.
[01:10:22.206 --> 01:10:31.691]  And Japan is so dense, they're so densely populated in the areas where they allow development, that there's a lot of people there dying.
[01:10:31.711 --> 01:10:33.872]  I mean, when you're watching those horrid videos.
[01:10:34.913 --> 01:10:35.933]  And here's the biggest news.
[01:10:36.954 --> 01:10:38.335]  Here's the biggest news right now.
[01:10:38.635 --> 01:10:39.635]  And I'm going to Japan.
[01:10:40.176 --> 01:10:41.697]  And your phone calls, Sheldon and others.
[01:10:43.458 --> 01:10:49.481]  Pressure at damaged Japanese nuclear reactor rising
[01:10:50.987 --> 01:11:06.178]  with fears so the pressure is rising they got six nukes at that one facility they're all huge the number one reactor the others are malfunctioning but still up and cooling uh... under the japanese law they've got to issue an emergency when one isn't cooling because
[01:11:07.179 --> 01:11:21.403]  The temperature will rise, and rise, and rise, and rise, and rise, and then the rods will set on fire, and then they will burn out of their casings, and they will plunge into the floor, and they will melt through the concrete, and then they will explode.
[01:11:21.423 --> 01:11:23.564]  And then they will shoot
[01:11:24.847 --> 01:11:33.754]  Radiation into the atmosphere with nuclear fallout, and you better believe when the plant blows up, it's probably going to make the other ones explode.
[01:11:33.974 --> 01:11:40.579]  And I was looking at photos and video of giant oil facilities on fire and huge gas tanks blowing up.
[01:11:40.659 --> 01:11:46.143]  I mean, Japan might as well have Godzilla stomping around right now, swinging his tail into buildings.
[01:11:46.443 --> 01:11:48.445]  I mean, Godzilla couldn't do this in an hour.
[01:11:49.045 --> 01:11:50.887]  I mean, this is devastating.
[01:11:51.928 --> 01:11:52.328]  Look at it.
[01:11:53.576 --> 01:11:54.937]  I got it on screen right now.
[01:11:55.177 --> 01:11:57.059]  Refinery is just on fire.
[01:11:57.099 --> 01:11:59.901]  I mean, this is absolutely crazy.
[01:12:01.682 --> 01:12:03.704]  Man, this is off the charts right now.
[01:12:04.124 --> 01:12:11.309]  And so many Americans are giggling and laughing about it like it's a spectator sport disconnected from reality.
[01:12:11.750 --> 01:12:13.971]  And I'm not even saying those poor people are bad folks.
[01:12:14.051 --> 01:12:19.756]  It's just that we've been so disconnected that people have lost their empathy.
[01:12:20.646 --> 01:12:30.994]  To a certain extent, where I guarantee you Americans are out there right now, and I've already seen some evidence of it, just kind of looking at this in awe like it's a spectacle.
[01:12:31.815 --> 01:12:33.777]  And I guess you can't judge them in a way it is.
[01:12:33.797 --> 01:12:43.725]  I mean, I saw a lot of New Yorkers, even the day of 9-11, who weren't actually hurt in it, kind of smiling and laughing and excited, like it was a football game or something.
[01:12:44.923 --> 01:12:50.267]  But I'm thinking about all the people in there dying, all the babies, little kids right now trapped, squealing for their mommy.
[01:12:50.568 --> 01:12:54.671]  Mommy's trapped under rubble a few feet away, watching their baby bleed to death right now.
[01:12:55.011 --> 01:12:59.975]  I mean, I'm envisioning and mapping what's going on in there, and I got kids, and it's freaking me out.
[01:13:00.516 --> 01:13:07.081]  So I actually feel like I'm about to throw up thinking about it, because I have system spectrum analysis understanding.
[01:13:07.501 --> 01:13:08.262]  It's not even hard.
[01:13:08.282 --> 01:13:12.906]  You know, I told Charlie Sheen, and I'm going to your calls, just three days ago, I said, this is what's going to happen.
[01:13:14.335 --> 01:13:19.219]  I said, a crazy person isn't going to make it through that front gate up there in the security guards in your neighborhood.
[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:21.841]  One of the most elite in Beverly Hills.
[01:13:22.482 --> 01:13:33.771]  I said, I have envisioned somebody's going to come through the back, climb up the probably 1,000 foot brush hill with a GPS and come over your back fence.
[01:13:33.971 --> 01:13:34.872]  That happened last night.
[01:13:35.972 --> 01:13:39.916]  I said, I envision all these people you let in your house who watch television.
[01:13:40.876 --> 01:13:42.578]  They've been pre-programmed.
[01:13:45.143 --> 01:13:48.505]  I said, I'm not bragging folks, this is really common sense.
[01:13:49.145 --> 01:13:52.306]  I said, you got that sharps rifle framed on the wall from a movie.
[01:13:52.686 --> 01:13:57.348]  It's a plugged movie replica and it's got some fake sharps rifle shells.
[01:13:57.749 --> 01:14:05.032]  You've got people that watch TV where it's set in dramas based in New York where they find a gun in somebody's house and they go to jail for it.
[01:14:05.788 --> 01:14:10.273]  I go, people call the police on veterans all the time because they see them putting a gun in their car to go deer hunting.
[01:14:10.753 --> 01:14:13.035]  I said, you're not supposed to have guns because of this restraining order.
[01:14:13.055 --> 01:14:13.916]  And he goes, we don't have guns.
[01:14:13.936 --> 01:14:14.917]  And I said, I know.
[01:14:15.438 --> 01:14:21.064]  But I said, you're going to have some control freak in your house who thinks you could have a toy gun they'll call the cops.
[01:14:21.684 --> 01:14:23.284]  I said, so that's going to happen.
[01:14:23.945 --> 01:14:28.866]  You're going to start having people climbing over the fence and the gates because you're the number one news story in the world.
[01:14:29.306 --> 01:14:32.327]  Right now, he's still as big or bigger than the tsunami.
[01:14:32.747 --> 01:14:33.247]  Shouldn't be.
[01:14:33.347 --> 01:14:35.447]  He thinks it's sick and is making jokes about it.
[01:14:35.788 --> 01:14:38.948]  You know, about the fact that he's bigger than the Gaddafi thing right now.
[01:14:40.429 --> 01:14:41.589]  So Charlie thinks it's crazy.
[01:14:41.609 --> 01:14:43.149]  He says, why are the fluoride heads into this?
[01:14:46.130 --> 01:14:47.270]  I told him that was going to happen.
[01:14:47.290 --> 01:14:48.751]  I told him they'd start trying to commit him.
[01:14:49.605 --> 01:14:50.406]  That's now starting.
[01:14:51.266 --> 01:14:52.067]  And he's not crazy.
[01:14:52.087 --> 01:14:56.950]  He's wound up, angry, drinking a lot of coffee, off drugs, so he's bouncing off the walls.
[01:14:56.970 --> 01:14:58.311]  He's a little manic, but that's not crazy.
[01:14:58.331 --> 01:15:04.576]  You know, they call little boys raising their hands too much and wanting to wrestle on the playground mental illness now.
[01:15:05.016 --> 01:15:11.261]  They've got dozens and dozens of mental illness designations if you don't trust authority and government.
[01:15:11.501 --> 01:15:13.162]  I mean, Thomas Jefferson would have been locked up.
[01:15:15.333 --> 01:15:20.596]  Point is, I don't just know how to analyze what's happening geopolitically, I can analyze people individually.
[01:15:20.996 --> 01:15:23.718]  By the way, any of you could do this, if you were tuned into reality.
[01:15:24.979 --> 01:15:27.861]  Okay, let's go to Sheldon in Japan, and I'm gonna go to some Twitter questions.
[01:15:28.581 --> 01:15:33.484]  But let's just pray this reactor doesn't melt down, and then a chain reaction, six reactors could go off.
[01:15:35.345 --> 01:15:38.507]  I mean, let's pray, and don't think prayer doesn't have an effect.
[01:15:39.428 --> 01:15:41.289]  Now, it could be God's will,
[01:15:42.978 --> 01:15:53.304]  They don't think they're in divine providence that God can work through people to throw themselves into the equipment, you know, to give them the understanding to get that, those emergency pumps working.
[01:15:54.245 --> 01:15:56.446]  This coastal plant got hit by a tsunami.
[01:15:56.966 --> 01:16:03.090]  Again, a country that has giant earthquakes, giant tsunamis, you know, the old-timers there built their houses out of paper.
[01:16:04.121 --> 01:16:04.581]  Because of this.
[01:16:04.601 --> 01:16:06.523]  Because they didn't like them falling on them.
[01:16:06.543 --> 01:16:07.684]  Yeah, that's the big cause of death.
[01:16:08.524 --> 01:16:09.305]  What a building code.
[01:16:09.325 --> 01:16:10.025]  You know, they figured it out.
[01:16:10.045 --> 01:16:14.408]  And you got a big concrete steel containment unit on the coastline.
[01:16:17.550 --> 01:16:18.991]  Most of the reactors are on the coast.
[01:16:19.932 --> 01:16:20.693]  Does that make sense?
[01:16:23.174 --> 01:16:25.236]  They got a level 4 bio-weapons lab.
[01:16:28.478 --> 01:16:29.599]  In a level 2 containment.
[01:16:30.179 --> 01:16:31.400]  That just means glass doors.
[01:16:37.691 --> 01:16:40.313]  Galveston, Texas, where hurricanes hit.
[01:16:41.814 --> 01:16:46.677]  But then the government's got to stick their hands down my pants because a terrorist might blow up an airplane.
[01:16:47.177 --> 01:16:49.619]  You've got a better chance of being struck by lightning or dying by a bee sting.
[01:16:49.839 --> 01:16:51.180]  But I've got to give up all my freedom.
[01:16:51.460 --> 01:16:52.221]  So federal goons.
[01:16:52.241 --> 01:16:52.961]  It's nothing to do with it.
[01:16:52.981 --> 01:16:53.902]  It's a federal takeover.
[01:16:53.922 --> 01:16:55.823]  The U.S.
[01:16:55.843 --> 01:16:58.285]  delivers coolant to a Japanese nuclear power plant.
[01:16:58.845 --> 01:17:00.446]  And I'm going to the Japan call here.
[01:17:00.466 --> 01:17:01.347]  I'm going to skip this break.
[01:17:03.885 --> 01:17:06.166]  Put the other article you just had up about U.S.
[01:17:06.186 --> 01:17:07.307]  military standing by.
[01:17:07.887 --> 01:17:08.788]  That's important, too.
[01:17:09.168 --> 01:17:11.009]  Now let's go to Sheldon in Japan.
[01:17:11.449 --> 01:17:12.650]  Sheldon, sorry I'm ranting.
[01:17:12.890 --> 01:17:14.170]  Where are you in Japan, Sheldon?
[01:17:14.190 --> 01:17:14.851]  What are you seeing?
[01:17:16.912 --> 01:17:18.913]  I'm actually in Osaka, Japan.
[01:17:18.933 --> 01:17:22.515]  Same as James, which is kind of far from the epicenter.
[01:17:23.075 --> 01:17:28.097]  It's like about the distance from San Francisco to Los Angeles, to put into context.
[01:17:28.918 --> 01:17:31.299]  But, you know, I was here at about 240, I guess 246,
[01:17:33.430 --> 01:17:35.671]  Are you north or south of Tokyo?
[01:17:35.691 --> 01:17:37.171]  Which way is the wind blowing this season?
[01:18:03.559 --> 01:18:09.061]  So, you are south of Tokyo, so you're going to be in the fallout zone if that reactor blows up.
[01:18:09.101 --> 01:18:10.002]  Are you concerned about that?
[01:18:12.422 --> 01:18:25.347]  Yeah, you know, it is a big concern, basically, but I mean, I'm kind of desensitized to it all because of all the, basically just the constant onslaught of all the materials we have in the sky, the chemtrails, all that.
[01:18:25.527 --> 01:18:28.889]  Well, let me tell you, this is going to be uranium and high-powered.
[01:18:29.589 --> 01:18:31.870]  I'm not trying to scare you, but do you have potassium iodate?
[01:18:34.645 --> 01:18:35.785]  No, I do not believe I do.
[01:18:36.086 --> 01:18:37.826]  No, we haven't had that sponsor in years.
[01:18:37.866 --> 01:18:38.266]  We should.
[01:18:38.326 --> 01:18:40.907]  I've got all my, every medicine cabinet in my house has got it.
[01:18:41.507 --> 01:18:48.289]  If there's a, now I don't want to give medical advice out and get people sick here, but you need to look up alternatives to potassium iodate.
[01:18:48.589 --> 01:18:57.371]  There are a few other things you can usually find in a drugstore quickly that are in the iodine family, but I don't remember the specifics, so I'm not going to get into it, in an emergency to fill your thyroid.
[01:18:57.391 --> 01:19:00.171]  Because see, what happens is, if you absorb that uranium 236, 238,
[01:19:02.592 --> 01:19:14.060]  And other isotopes because when it melts down, it mixes with things in the surrounding environment and throws off all sorts of horrible miscreant variants of it.
[01:19:14.300 --> 01:19:19.984]  You gotta fill your thyroid ahead of the radiation hitting you.
[01:19:20.685 --> 01:19:28.110]  And again, are they on the news there telling people to get to government emergency facilities handing out the potassium iodate?
[01:19:30.562 --> 01:19:31.682]  No, not really, no.
[01:19:31.702 --> 01:19:36.303]  Like, in this part of the country, they're not really doing much other than, you know, they're playing it on every news channel.
[01:19:36.843 --> 01:19:42.325]  But they're not really, there's no, like, feeling of, uh, you know, fear, basically.
[01:19:42.525 --> 01:19:50.446]  So in a nuclear-powered country, in a nuclear-powered country, they don't tell everybody to have potassium iodine.
[01:19:54.027 --> 01:19:54.747]  No, not at all.
[01:19:54.767 --> 01:19:56.128]  They don't tell anything, basically.
[01:19:56.828 --> 01:19:57.368]  Yeah, I mean,
[01:19:58.622 --> 01:20:04.883]  Here, the culture is really kind of, you know, just be quiet and don't cause any trouble.
[01:20:04.903 --> 01:20:07.284]  You know, that's really the culture of Japan.
[01:20:07.584 --> 01:20:14.785]  In Japan, they have a saying, don't be the nail that sticks out, because that's the first one to get hit.
[01:20:14.805 --> 01:20:18.126]  So everybody just kind of just, you know, does what they're told.
[01:20:18.186 --> 01:20:22.127]  Yeah, I have a saying, every nail should stick out and then they can never hammer us all in.
[01:20:23.587 --> 01:20:24.507]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:20:26.752 --> 01:20:28.913]  Well, listen, Sheldon, I appreciate you calling.
[01:20:29.073 --> 01:20:32.774]  So you're south of the fallout right now that blows.
[01:20:35.336 --> 01:20:37.777]  Boy, let me tell you, that is not a good thing.
[01:20:38.097 --> 01:20:40.138]  Well, do you have a gas mask?
[01:20:42.558 --> 01:20:44.079]  No, no, I do not have a gas mask.
[01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:55.764]  All I have, basically, when the earthquake actually hit, you know, all I was thinking was to grab my gold, because I have, you know, I bought some gold here, and I want to actually just have that on me in case I have to run from the apartment.
[01:20:59.597 --> 01:21:06.224]  I'm not trying to scare you, but if that reactor melts down, everybody's going to start running.
[01:21:06.685 --> 01:21:13.913]  If I was you, I would study the winds, I'd get online, pull up, you know, they'll have the exact winds right now, what they're forecast for in the next week.
[01:21:14.534 --> 01:21:30.950]  And then I would make a decision to go not north, because it might blow and then you'll be in the way of a tsunami, but whichever way the winds probably aren't going, or behind a mountain range, wherever you can go away from those winds, just as a precaution, buddy.
[01:21:31.350 --> 01:21:37.376]  And of course, again, if it actually blows, then they're going to tell folks to shelter in place, but people still run.
[01:21:38.357 --> 01:21:52.049]  Look, if I was you, I know there's a mountain range up the middle, I would try to study those winds and get on the other side of the mountain range or go further south or down to the tip because it'll probably go south and then I'm looking at some of the wind charts right now and go out to sea.
[01:21:52.650 --> 01:21:58.255]  If I was you, I'd be, I would be as on a bullet train going south and then to the
[01:22:00.114 --> 01:22:00.554]  West.
[01:22:01.735 --> 01:22:07.996]  Again, just as a precaution, sir, if I was you, I would be getting out of Dodge so fast it would make people's heads spin, Sheldon.
[01:22:09.677 --> 01:22:10.657]  Yeah, I hear you.
[01:22:12.218 --> 01:22:13.578]  Again, it may not melt down.
[01:22:13.618 --> 01:22:26.502]  We pray it doesn't melt down, but you know what's going to happen if that reactor melts down and blows, you understand, it's going to explode and shoot radiation into the air and, I mean, it's literally killed tens of thousands of people with complications in the last 20 years since Chernobyl.
[01:22:27.321 --> 01:22:29.662]  I mean, you do not want to be radiated by this, buddy.
[01:22:29.682 --> 01:22:31.703]  You think chemtrails, aluminum dioxide is bad?
[01:22:32.524 --> 01:22:35.345]  This is nothing compared to a high-powered dose of radiation.
[01:22:37.386 --> 01:22:38.046]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:22:38.087 --> 01:22:42.309]  I'm worried that you can kind of cover it up, basically, because... Exactly!
[01:22:42.389 --> 01:22:44.130]  It could blow up and they won't even tell you.
[01:22:44.450 --> 01:22:44.950]  Exactly.
[01:22:44.970 --> 01:22:45.770]  I'm telling you.
[01:22:46.191 --> 01:22:46.731]  I'm telling you.
[01:22:47.151 --> 01:22:51.013]  Study the trade winds right now, pick a spot, and get out of Dodge right now, Sheldon.
[01:22:53.074 --> 01:22:53.334]  Alright.
[01:22:54.235 --> 01:22:54.535]  Thank you.
[01:22:56.940 --> 01:23:02.184]  And of course the media will be like, Alex Jones told Japanese to get out of the fallout zone.
[01:23:02.204 --> 01:23:07.567]  Of course it might melt down and do the China syndrome like Chernobyl.
[01:23:08.128 --> 01:23:12.191]  But again, you need to just, we recommend you go outside and breathe deeply.
[01:23:12.511 --> 01:23:15.633]  And don't take potassium iodide, that's Al Qaeda as well.
[01:23:17.494 --> 01:23:18.435]  I can't handle it anymore.
[01:23:20.950 --> 01:23:26.233]  There's Josh in California that's in the path of tsunami waves that haven't hit yet.
[01:23:26.273 --> 01:23:28.014]  We know... Pardon me?
[01:23:29.235 --> 01:23:29.916]  Oh, he just dropped.
[01:23:31.396 --> 01:23:44.985]  Again, for those that don't know, some tsunami waves did hit the Pacific island of Hawaii, the Hawaiian islands to be technical, the chain, and they're ordering people in several towns to evacuate.
[01:23:45.385 --> 01:23:47.627]  In Oregon, they're low-lying, close to sea level.
[01:23:48.527 --> 01:23:50.129]  And beautiful Pacific Northwest.
[01:23:51.070 --> 01:23:57.478]  And quite frankly, the only thing that really matters right now is that they're talking about this reactor melting down.
[01:23:57.498 --> 01:23:59.340]  We'll continue to go over that.
[01:24:00.301 --> 01:24:02.163]  The temperature's rising as of an hour ago.
[01:24:04.085 --> 01:24:06.268]  And they're telling people this.
[01:24:06.808 --> 01:24:08.831]  This is ABC, Reuters, you name it.
[01:24:11.837 --> 01:24:17.620]  The media will play on people's ignorance like ten years from now and say, Jones once said a reactor may melt down in Japan.
[01:24:17.860 --> 01:24:18.680]  It was made up.
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:20.101]  There was no reactor.
[01:24:20.521 --> 01:24:21.722]  Japan doesn't exist.
[01:24:22.742 --> 01:24:26.164]  Like the time ABC News reported Russia had fired an ICBM at us.
[01:24:26.724 --> 01:24:34.368]  I ran in and said it on air, because it was on ABC News, and then a month later nobody remembered it and people said, Alex said they fired an ICBM.
[01:24:35.048 --> 01:24:36.629]  I didn't say that, ABC News said that.
[01:24:37.129 --> 01:24:39.390]  And they came out and said, oh it was just a test missile, no big deal.
[01:24:40.748 --> 01:24:43.029]  And then China fires a missile off the coast.
[01:24:43.429 --> 01:24:46.811]  Even Pentagon officials blew the whistle on that, and they still say it was a chemtrail.
[01:24:47.291 --> 01:24:49.992]  And then people call me and say, you claim a missile was fired off the coast.
[01:24:50.312 --> 01:24:55.274]  No, I said my guest said that, and people in the Pentagon and the former head of NASA said it was a missile trail.
[01:24:56.395 --> 01:24:58.095]  That's how mainstream media spins things.
[01:24:58.616 --> 01:25:04.398]  I tell the Rolling Stone that I smoked pot a little bit, didn't like it, and it turns into, Alex then quit smoking pot.
[01:25:04.958 --> 01:25:06.139]  Like I was some kind of pothead.
[01:25:07.244 --> 01:25:07.844]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:25:08.145 --> 01:25:22.494]  Everybody knows this is happening in Japan, and people will probably remember in a year when the media takes it out of context, and they'll probably say that I said Godzilla was real, you know, because I was talking about Japanese archetypes of worrying about disaster because their country's so prone to it.
[01:25:23.496 --> 01:25:25.017]  You know, it's kind of like Charlie Sheen.
[01:25:25.517 --> 01:25:29.318]  So much of what I talk to him about, he adopts, because he likes me.
[01:25:30.139 --> 01:25:40.243]  But then I kind of with horror watch it, because folks, when he's joking around about Vatican assassin warlocks, it was all just because people said that we were reptoid Vatican assassin warlocks.
[01:25:40.323 --> 01:25:44.805]  And now people really believe we're Vatican assassin reptoid warlocks.
[01:25:44.885 --> 01:25:47.906]  But I don't believe Godzilla's real, folks.
[01:25:47.986 --> 01:25:51.027]  And Charlie Sheen's joking about Vatican assassin warlocks.
[01:25:54.161 --> 01:25:55.101]  People just can't get it.
[01:25:55.842 --> 01:25:58.762]  They just really, really can't get it and won't get it.
[01:26:00.343 --> 01:26:03.324]  I've got a headache and a stomachache watching all this happen.
[01:26:04.804 --> 01:26:07.605]  We've got pharmacist Ben Fuchs coming up after the break.
[01:26:08.145 --> 01:26:11.346]  And we're going to shift gears for 30 minutes on things you can do to protect yourself.
[01:26:11.626 --> 01:26:12.606]  And he's a pharmacist!
[01:26:13.007 --> 01:26:14.327]  Oh my gosh, I can ask him.
[01:26:15.187 --> 01:26:16.228]  I can search it online.
[01:26:16.668 --> 01:26:17.268]  I just know that
[01:26:18.709 --> 01:26:27.836]  Regular types of iodine, like the military gives troops in their emergency kits and fighter pilots and others in case they're shot down in nuclear fallout, make you throw up and get sick.
[01:26:28.576 --> 01:26:34.501]  There's the potassium iodate pills that are softened that I have and that we've promoted in the past.
[01:26:34.521 --> 01:26:35.922]  We don't have a sponsor for that right now.
[01:26:35.962 --> 01:26:36.422]  We should.
[01:26:36.442 --> 01:26:38.023]  It's really cheap.
[01:26:38.143 --> 01:26:41.746]  I guess we don't have a sponsor because it's so cheap they never make the money to advertise.
[01:26:42.066 --> 01:26:43.067]  People get it, they get it.
[01:26:46.309 --> 01:26:58.111]  So I can ask him about if people don't listen, don't get potassium iodate, a reactor blows up, what are the types of iodine you can take to fill your thyroid?
[01:26:58.131 --> 01:27:03.893]  You see, what happens is the number one cause of death in nuclear fallout is in fast-growing cells and glands.
[01:27:04.073 --> 01:27:05.193]  I know this because I've researched it.
[01:27:05.473 --> 01:27:07.793]  We'll talk to pharmacist Ben Fuchs about it when we come back.
[01:27:08.293 --> 01:27:11.034]  And what happens is your
[01:27:13.254 --> 01:27:16.456]  Thyroid particularly regulates much of the body's metabolic system.
[01:27:16.716 --> 01:27:17.397]  That's not debated.
[01:27:17.957 --> 01:27:25.602]  And in fallout, the teeth fall out, you get bleeding in the intestines, but they're tough, the guts can come back, and you can survive your teeth falling out.
[01:27:27.285 --> 01:27:30.908]  Again, fast growing cells in the intestines, they all shed.
[01:27:30.928 --> 01:27:33.410]  It's one of the most painful things, reportedly.
[01:27:33.890 --> 01:27:35.091]  Bloody diarrhea for weeks.
[01:27:35.672 --> 01:27:38.914]  But if you survive that, the one thing you won't survive is your thyroid.
[01:27:39.354 --> 01:27:43.317]  It will uptake and suck up the radioactive isotopes.
[01:27:44.799 --> 01:27:47.561]  If it's not full iodine, that's the thing that is a blocker.
[01:27:48.855 --> 01:27:55.763]  And it will die inside your head, inside your throat, and you will die.
[01:27:56.143 --> 01:27:56.704]  You will die.
[01:27:56.784 --> 01:27:57.364]  It will rot.
[01:27:57.445 --> 01:27:57.945]  You will die.
[01:27:58.005 --> 01:27:58.466]  You will die.
[01:27:59.802 --> 01:28:04.045]  If you get a moderate dose of uranium in the different isotopes, and if your thyroid isn't filled.
[01:28:04.065 --> 01:28:04.765]  Now that's U.S.
[01:28:04.845 --> 01:28:06.106]  Army standard issue.
[01:28:06.126 --> 01:28:12.309]  Of course, they hate the trip so much, they give them a toxic form of it that makes them vomit and throw up, but it's better than dying.
[01:28:13.290 --> 01:28:19.514]  There is the potassium iodate brands out there that make you a little sick, but you upload it quicker, and we'll talk about that.
[01:28:20.374 --> 01:28:21.395]  Look, I don't live in fear.
[01:28:21.975 --> 01:28:22.615]  It's the opposite.
[01:28:22.675 --> 01:28:23.556]  I got firearms.
[01:28:23.876 --> 01:28:25.817]  I got a three-year supply of food for my whole family.
[01:28:26.257 --> 01:28:27.198]  I got a water well.
[01:28:27.318 --> 01:28:28.239]  I've moved out in the country.
[01:28:29.338 --> 01:28:34.983]  I've got all this, not because I live in fear, but because I know the world's an uncertain, crazy place.
[01:28:35.684 --> 01:28:46.434]  And people will never believe they're gonna get mugged, or raped, or earthquake, or tsunami, or that a black widow's gonna bite them and kill them, or that they're gonna die in a car wreck.
[01:28:46.474 --> 01:28:47.795]  Number one cause of death is a car wreck.
[01:28:47.815 --> 01:28:48.936]  People are not afraid of it.
[01:28:49.156 --> 01:28:50.498]  They drive around like maniacs.
[01:28:52.780 --> 01:28:54.822]  But they're so afraid of Arabs,
[01:28:56.277 --> 01:28:59.384]  You got a better chance of dying of honeybeeing sting, bolt of lightning.
[01:28:59.945 --> 01:29:05.096]  It's something like 24 times in the World Almanac, better chance of dying drowning, you know, drowned.
[01:29:07.498 --> 01:29:08.438]  Pull those numbers up.
[01:29:09.159 --> 01:29:15.222]  But it's not scary to die in the water, I guess, or to die from a bee sting or in a car wreck.
[01:29:15.482 --> 01:29:16.922]  Well, that's a pretty scary way to die.
[01:29:17.423 --> 01:29:18.043]  Any one of those.
[01:29:18.843 --> 01:29:26.507]  No, it's something about a man in a nightgown or whatever they wear and a big beard.
[01:29:27.007 --> 01:29:28.788]  It's fun to get into the fear.
[01:29:28.828 --> 01:29:32.910]  Oh, I love trips with machine guns and German shepherds and body scanners.
[01:29:33.150 --> 01:29:34.471]  That's what you're supposed to be scared of.
[01:29:35.461 --> 01:29:37.141]  That's what's always dangerous, the government.
[01:29:37.782 --> 01:29:40.502]  See, I see that, and I'm like, whoa, danger, Will Robinson!
[01:29:40.522 --> 01:29:43.043]  The government killed hundreds of millions of people last century.
[01:29:43.623 --> 01:29:45.423]  And it's getting a good start right now in this century.
[01:29:46.244 --> 01:29:49.404]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs coming up, more on the earthquakes and everything else.
[01:29:49.824 --> 01:29:52.825]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.745 --> 01:29:56.426]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:03.877 --> 01:30:04.798]  Tyranny is here.
[01:30:05.158 --> 01:30:08.701]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:30:09.021 --> 01:30:11.323]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:30:11.463 --> 01:30:16.747]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:30:17.167 --> 01:30:23.412]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:30:23.832 --> 01:30:29.377]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:30:29.777 --> 01:30:33.460]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:30:34.001 --> 01:30:38.004]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:30:38.285 --> 01:30:43.809]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:30:44.230 --> 01:30:47.212]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:30:47.793 --> 01:30:49.214]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:30:49.754 --> 01:30:50.195]  It's here.

[01:31:12.259 --> 01:31:17.541]  Not looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[01:31:18.301 --> 01:31:25.344]  Not worried about them moving south, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[01:31:28.101 --> 01:31:32.483]  I'm looking for America.
[01:31:33.623 --> 01:31:35.484]  Wear American and be proud.
[01:31:35.584 --> 01:31:37.825]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[01:31:37.845 --> 01:31:42.047]  The land of the free and the home of the brave.
[01:31:42.367 --> 01:31:46.168]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[01:31:54.053 --> 01:31:58.629]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[01:31:59.192 --> 01:32:03.435]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:32:03.755 --> 01:32:04.355]  Number 1.
[01:32:04.656 --> 01:32:07.818]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:08.098 --> 01:32:08.638]  Number 2.
[01:32:08.959 --> 01:32:13.502]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:13.842 --> 01:32:14.282]  It's true.
[01:32:14.582 --> 01:32:19.145]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:19.466 --> 01:32:20.006]  Number 3.
[01:32:20.286 --> 01:32:23.568]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:23.868 --> 01:32:27.571]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:27.771 --> 01:32:28.312]  Number 4.
[01:32:28.572 --> 01:32:30.934]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:31.334 --> 01:32:34.697]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:32:35.017 --> 01:32:35.218]  Number 5.
[01:32:35.798 --> 01:32:39.721]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:32:39.942 --> 01:32:44.706]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:32:44.986 --> 01:32:49.013]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:49.173 --> 01:32:50.736]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:50.956 --> 01:32:53.020]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:55.544]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:33:15.996 --> 01:33:17.877]  Okay, we are back live.
[01:33:17.897 --> 01:33:27.701]  We'll continue with the latest on the nuclear reactor that is in danger of melting down via a Chernobyl slash China syndrome.
[01:33:28.741 --> 01:33:33.363]  In Japan, the huge tsunami, the record in modern history recorded earthquake
[01:33:34.734 --> 01:33:42.381]  8.9.
[01:33:34.934 --> 01:33:42.381]  Ladies and gentlemen, a 10 is in the world type stuff, because it doubles each level up.
[01:33:42.541 --> 01:33:45.604]  I mean, we're talking lava shooting 10,000 feet in the air.
[01:33:46.205 --> 01:33:50.228]  I mean, an 8.9 is so devastating.
[01:33:51.970 --> 01:33:58.275]  Well, it's the record in the last 100 years of recorded seismographs with a seismologist out there.
[01:34:00.970 --> 01:34:01.931]  This is just incredible.
[01:34:02.331 --> 01:34:04.053]  But pharmacist Ben Fuchs joins us.
[01:34:04.093 --> 01:34:05.034]  He's a GCN host.
[01:34:05.074 --> 01:34:05.415]  Sundays.
[01:34:05.735 --> 01:34:07.877]  He's about to be on the hour before I am every day.
[01:34:07.937 --> 01:34:08.398]  Weekdays.
[01:34:09.299 --> 01:34:10.099]  Talk show host.
[01:34:11.241 --> 01:34:12.182]  And Ben Fuchs.
[01:34:13.909 --> 01:34:16.252]  Also again host The Bright Side.
[01:34:16.272 --> 01:34:20.957]  He's a featured nutritional and wellness information researcher.
[01:34:21.017 --> 01:34:33.109]  He's also a degreed pharmacist of many years until he discovered what these synthetic drugs were actually doing and how they're designed to treat the symptoms and not the cause.
[01:34:34.050 --> 01:34:35.592]  And he's also involved
[01:34:36.653 --> 01:34:47.398]  With myself, with Longevity, and really trying to get people back into minerals, back into nutrients, and the super high quality products that are provided there at InfoWarsTeam.com.
[01:34:48.499 --> 01:34:52.000]  But, Ben, you've been on hold, and I appreciate you joining us.
[01:34:52.541 --> 01:35:03.806]  I'm sorry every time I have you scheduled some big emergency comes up, but you heard my question about the thyroid and potassium iodate, and things that people can use during fallout to protect their thyroid.
[01:35:03.946 --> 01:35:05.067]  Can you break that down for us?
[01:35:05.827 --> 01:35:06.007]  Sure.
[01:35:07.193 --> 01:35:08.434]  Thank you very much Alex for having me on.
[01:35:08.474 --> 01:35:09.235]  It's a pleasure to be here.
[01:35:10.015 --> 01:35:15.098]  The thyroid gland is your body's main metabolic gland and it's a vacuum cleaner for iodine.
[01:35:15.378 --> 01:35:22.142]  It sucks up iodine the way your Hoover vacuum cleaner sucks up the dirt off your carpet because iodine is incredibly important for thyroid functioning.
[01:35:22.623 --> 01:35:26.285]  One of the effects of nuclear reactor disasters is
[01:35:27.080 --> 01:35:37.787]  The spewing out of radioactive iodine, and because the thyroid gland is so efficient at sucking up iodine, if there is no regular iodine present, and this has a lot of implications to play in thyroid health.
[01:35:37.947 --> 01:35:38.787]  We'll get to that in a second.
[01:35:38.827 --> 01:35:45.872]  If there's no iodine present, it will take up the radioactive iodine instead, and thus irradiating the thyroid.
[01:35:45.912 --> 01:35:52.776]  That's why it's important to have iodine present in the body, so the thyroid will not take in the radioactive iodine.
[01:35:52.796 --> 01:35:54.357]  Now, if there's a disaster, you can take
[01:35:55.041 --> 01:36:01.164]  Potassium iodide and SSKI is a nice little treatment for radioactive iodine disasters.
[01:36:01.264 --> 01:36:07.946]  But even more importantly, you have to have these supplements, these components in your body at all times.
[01:36:08.387 --> 01:36:11.968]  Because if you don't have them, your body will make do with what it can find.
[01:36:12.008 --> 01:36:19.031]  And for example, there's a component in our environment called bromide that is found in flour and it's found as a purifier of water.
[01:36:19.111 --> 01:36:21.832]  And since the 1970s, bakers have used this bromide
[01:36:22.245 --> 01:36:22.685]  I think so.
[01:36:47.478 --> 01:36:50.921]  of nutritional components in your body at all times.
[01:36:51.141 --> 01:37:02.450]  All right, Ben, I apologize again, and I want you to continue, but it's really almost perfect timing to have you here today to show, just with this example of these reactors, how all of this interacts.
[01:37:02.490 --> 01:37:03.591]  But here's the bad news.
[01:37:04.812 --> 01:37:13.359]  Fox News, Associated Press are now reporting radiation leak at the number one Fukushima plant.
[01:37:13.379 --> 01:37:14.640]  There's six of them there together.
[01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:16.522]  The temperature is rising.
[01:37:17.785 --> 01:37:27.676]  If it continues, it will melt down in some way and could explode and go into a Chernobyl or China syndrome.
[01:37:28.497 --> 01:37:32.281]  And of course that means, quote, melting through the earth, is the term China syndrome.
[01:37:32.821 --> 01:37:36.385]  Possible radiation leak at Japan nuclear plant, a radiation leak could occur.
[01:37:37.466 --> 01:37:43.334]  Or could be occurring at the Fukushima nuclear plant near Tokyo in the aftermath of the 8.9 magnitude earthquake.
[01:37:43.374 --> 01:37:51.285]  Japanese Trade Minister Bari Kaida told Kyoto News just minutes ago.
[01:37:53.089 --> 01:37:57.771]  And there's 2,800 residents living near the reactor, and they're saying that they may need to evacuate.
[01:37:58.011 --> 01:37:59.472]  How deceptive is that?
[01:38:00.373 --> 01:38:02.273]  You know, to only say the locals are worried.
[01:38:02.614 --> 01:38:07.936]  I mean, this thing is going to send radiation all over the world if it does melt down.
[01:38:08.336 --> 01:38:09.197]  Sorry, Ben, go ahead.
[01:38:10.236 --> 01:38:18.240]  Well, what I'm saying is that it's very important to have nutritional components in your body at all times, because if you don't, your body will make do with whatever it can find.
[01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:21.722]  For example, I gave the example about bromide, but fluoride is the same thing.
[01:38:22.202 --> 01:38:32.447]  If you don't have iodine present in your body, your thyroid will take in fluoride instead of the iodine that it needs, and now you have fluoride taken up into the thyroid in addition to the bromide.
[01:38:32.467 --> 01:38:39.831]  The bottom line is, is you have to have these nutritional components in your system at all times, and the simplest way to do it is through a nutritional supplement program.
[01:38:41.104 --> 01:38:53.970]  That's why I'm behind the longevity products, that's why I'm behind nutritional supplementation, and that's why I've been traveling around the country for the last 15, 16 years talking about how important it is to make sure you have a baseline level of nutritional supplements going in your body at all times.
[01:38:54.851 --> 01:39:05.476]  Well, the globalists know what they're doing, saying, hey, you don't need the iodine in your food, you need the bromide, knowing it's toxic, knowing the sodium fluoride's toxic.
[01:39:07.059 --> 01:39:15.147]  What do you make, Pharmacist Ben Fuchs, of suddenly the EPA going, OK, we're going to look at stopping using fluoride as a pesticide.
[01:39:15.728 --> 01:39:19.712]  Maybe we're going to look at not allowing it to be put in flour to bleach things.
[01:39:20.452 --> 01:39:22.695]  We're going to look at cutting it in water.
[01:39:23.115 --> 01:39:25.758]  It looks like we're starting to win the fight against these people.
[01:39:26.849 --> 01:39:30.310]  The only way we can win the fight is if we take the ball into our own court.
[01:39:30.890 --> 01:39:33.811]  It doesn't do any good to hand wring and to complain and to whine.
[01:39:33.851 --> 01:39:35.612]  We have to take the ball into our own court.
[01:39:35.652 --> 01:39:39.253]  And as long as we're sick, we're not going to be strong enough to fight this tyranny.
[01:39:39.553 --> 01:39:45.315]  We have to make sure that we have the raw materials in our body to maintain good health so we do not have to interface
[01:39:45.765 --> 01:39:46.705]  With the medical model.
[01:39:46.765 --> 01:39:48.466]  If you're sick, you're going to be forced to interface.
[01:39:49.146 --> 01:39:51.727]  Briefly, recap who you are, how you woke up.
[01:39:51.767 --> 01:39:53.288]  You're always talking about the thyroid.
[01:39:53.748 --> 01:39:58.610]  So many women now have an epidemic of thyroid dysfunction, their hair falling out, they're overweight.
[01:39:59.010 --> 01:39:59.971]  Same thing with men.
[01:40:00.351 --> 01:40:07.494]  And they'll just give the women artificial thyroid instead of telling them, and this is on record, hey it's the fluoride, hey it's the...
[01:40:08.254 --> 01:40:12.355]  So just in that area, break down how important this is.
[01:40:12.396 --> 01:40:17.417]  Get into other mineral deficiencies because if you're deficient, then other things are going to take the place.
[01:40:17.797 --> 01:40:23.860]  And then, last time we didn't talk much about it, run down the longevity products that are available and we can discount to the listeners.
[01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:25.860]  And folks, this is about taking action.
[01:40:26.060 --> 01:40:27.261]  I say buy gold, it goes up.
[01:40:27.581 --> 01:40:28.421]  I say get the minerals.
[01:40:28.441 --> 01:40:34.843]  I mean, I promote what I believe in at InfoWarsTeam, that's one word, InfoWarsTeam.com.
[01:40:35.504 --> 01:40:36.364]  Break it down for people.
[01:40:37.335 --> 01:40:44.000]  This is what I noticed 15, 16 years ago when I started to explore this idea of disease from a pharmacy perspective.
[01:40:44.380 --> 01:40:51.846]  We have all kinds of symptoms that people suffer from, whether it's fibromyalgia, or whether it's headaches, or whether it's blood pressure issues, or blood sugar issues, whatever.
[01:40:51.886 --> 01:40:57.450]  We have lots of symptoms, but all symptoms come from three places and three places only.
[01:40:57.850 --> 01:41:01.933]  If you attack the symptoms, you end up playing that silly game that people play at the amusement park where they
[01:41:02.173 --> 01:41:05.574]  Hit the mole in one hole and the mole pops up in another hole.
[01:41:05.594 --> 01:41:07.295]  And that's what the medical model does.
[01:41:07.335 --> 01:41:13.077]  It hits the mole in one hole and then it hits the mole in the other hole and it keeps trying to hit the moles, hit the moles.
[01:41:13.397 --> 01:41:18.399]  But if you attack the problem at the causal level, the symptoms all fall into line.
[01:41:18.786 --> 01:41:20.527]  And the causal levels are three.
[01:41:20.887 --> 01:41:25.168]  Number one, first and foremost, all disease is connected to the digestive system.
[01:41:25.528 --> 01:41:27.909]  And then secondly, the blood sugar and insulin system.
[01:41:27.949 --> 01:41:31.530]  And then thirdly, the adrenal gland stress system.
[01:41:31.831 --> 01:41:36.652]  So, all disease needs to be backtracked, first and foremost, to the digestive system.
[01:41:37.032 --> 01:41:42.434]  No matter what your symptoms are, you have to figure out what the digestive component is.
[01:41:42.834 --> 01:41:46.796]  And that involves supplementation, and that involves lifestyle changes around the food you're eating.
[01:41:47.936 --> 01:41:48.297]  Yeah, I think.
[01:42:03.032 --> 01:42:03.672]  We're good to go!
[01:42:32.805 --> 01:42:37.949]  And lifestyle, digestive, food strategies, all of your symptoms will fall into line.
[01:42:38.290 --> 01:42:44.775]  And the key component here, as always, is going to be nutritional supplementation, because the foods are corrupt.
[01:42:45.155 --> 01:42:47.918]  The foods are corrupt from the soil upward.
[01:42:48.138 --> 01:42:56.925]  There's no minerals in the soil, or there's a few minerals in the soil, which means there's less nutrients in the produce, which means there's less nutrients in the meat and the fish that we're eating.
[01:42:57.245 --> 01:42:57.546]  I think so.
[01:43:16.107 --> 01:43:17.069]  Absolutely, and Ben Fuchs, you know, I
[01:43:33.928 --> 01:43:43.515]  I talked the talk, and I walked the walk on most issues, but I told Charlie Sheen three weeks ago, I said, get a Twitter, communicate directly with your fans, boom, he did it.
[01:43:43.936 --> 01:43:45.597]  But then I don't even promote my own Twitter.
[01:43:47.765 --> 01:43:47.845]  Yes.
[01:44:17.845 --> 01:44:19.766]  Follow my own orders and start taking it.
[01:44:20.147 --> 01:44:21.928]  And now I'm well and I feel better than ever.
[01:44:22.208 --> 01:44:29.232]  So people, from here on out, we're going to see in the next few months the transformation that takes place on these products.
[01:44:30.113 --> 01:44:32.214]  You're going to see it here on air and see what happens.
[01:44:32.795 --> 01:44:34.316]  But everybody I know just loves them.
[01:44:34.776 --> 01:44:46.443]  And the difference is, and why I did the research and decided to work with Ben and the other great folks that are involved, Dr. Joel Wallach, the inventor, is because I've separately, and it doesn't mean I
[01:44:47.478 --> 01:44:48.139]  I talk the talk.
[01:44:48.199 --> 01:44:49.500]  I'm starting to try to walk the walk.
[01:44:49.920 --> 01:45:09.299]  I've researched synthetic vitamins, true vitamins and minerals that come from an absorbable natural source, and that's why Ben Fuchs separately, because he's his own man, has his own products, you name it, really loves longevity because he's looked at a lot of products himself and knows these truly have the right ingredients.
[01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:11.862]  Explain what's in the longevity products.
[01:45:12.582 --> 01:45:14.063]  Well, let me tell you a couple things.
[01:45:40.837 --> 01:45:51.804]  I talked about the digestive system, and if you're going to start a supplement program, you want to make absolutely sure that you start your nutritional supplement program with digestive supplements, because it doesn't matter what you're taking if you're not absorbing them.
[01:45:52.105 --> 01:45:57.428]  So, most importantly, you want to focus on digestive enzymes and probiotics and things that help you absorb nutrients.
[01:45:57.508 --> 01:46:02.592]  I want to get to that in a second, because you asked a very interesting question about the Longevity products specifically.
[01:46:03.132 --> 01:46:17.487]  And Dr. Wallach, who is one of my nutritional heroes, in fact he's my main nutritional hero and nutritional guru, what makes him so brilliant is he was one of the first people to catch on to the idea that minerals have to be in the correct form for them to have their activity.
[01:46:17.907 --> 01:46:25.335]  Minerals have an electrical property, but in order for them to have that electrical property, or to have that electrical property be usable by the body,
[01:46:25.575 --> 01:46:28.436]  The minerals have to be in a format that we call colloidal.
[01:46:28.516 --> 01:46:48.225]  Now, over the years, over millions of years, plants that have evolved the ability to take rocks from the earth and turn them into these colloidal substances, over the course of millions of years, as the plants die off and the organic matter starts to decay, what's left behind are the minerals that the plant has taken from the earth
[01:46:48.567 --> 01:46:51.708]  And activated and electrified in a colloidal format.
[01:46:51.808 --> 01:46:59.210]  And today we can actually scoop those minerals out from areas where plants have been concentrated over the course of eons.
[01:46:59.490 --> 01:47:03.472]  We can scoop those minerals out of mines and out of caves and out of seabeds.
[01:47:03.512 --> 01:47:07.913]  And we can put them in liquid drinks and reactivate those minerals.
[01:47:07.993 --> 01:47:10.074]  Make them electrically active again.
[01:47:10.114 --> 01:47:12.915]  And Dr. Wallach was one of the first guys to talk about this.
[01:47:13.315 --> 01:47:17.656]  And he developed an entire nutritional company built around the concept of electrified
[01:47:17.896 --> 01:47:18.256]  I think so.
[01:47:43.264 --> 01:47:48.428]  And to quantify that, the body is electrochemical, for those that don't know.
[01:47:48.928 --> 01:47:53.972]  And to simplify it, these are the type they need and have the absorbability.
[01:47:53.992 --> 01:48:07.342]  I mean, to dumb it down, just mainline nutrition, they have the synthetic cheap vitamins that I've read mainline studies are even toxic to the body, versus what they call the naturally occurring vitamins and minerals.
[01:48:07.742 --> 01:48:08.543]  Can you explain that?
[01:48:09.059 --> 01:48:11.020]  Well, the core is always going to be the minerals.
[01:48:11.080 --> 01:48:16.161]  Vitamins, as a matter of fact, are defined technically as co-enzymes.
[01:48:16.261 --> 01:48:17.882]  Vitamins are co-factors.
[01:48:17.902 --> 01:48:23.044]  They help chemical reactions work, and they help facilitate chemical reactions, and without them you would die.
[01:48:23.084 --> 01:48:28.226]  But the core of everything that we talk about are these electrical components that are known as minerals.
[01:48:28.246 --> 01:48:31.787]  When we talk about a mineral, folks, what we're really talking about is a battery.
[01:48:32.087 --> 01:48:37.869]  And that's why you have lithium batteries, and nickel batteries, and cadmium batteries, and your batteries have zinc in them,
[01:48:38.237 --> 01:48:43.920]  If you look at all batteries, you'll find minerals there because minerals function as little tiny microscopic batteries.
[01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:49.223]  And when you ingest them into your system, you're literally ingesting a microscopic electrical battery.
[01:48:49.483 --> 01:48:51.704]  Yeah folks, that's how food works.
[01:48:52.224 --> 01:49:03.210]  And then oxygen is the main driver that is pushing through the system the different vitamins and minerals that are needed to drive the machines that are inside the cells.
[01:49:03.968 --> 01:49:05.229]  Oxygen is what explodes.
[01:49:05.289 --> 01:49:06.130]  It's like in your car.
[01:49:06.891 --> 01:49:08.692]  If you look at your... They used to have carburetors in the car.
[01:49:08.732 --> 01:49:09.633]  Now they have fuel injection.
[01:49:09.653 --> 01:49:15.579]  But the way it used to work is oxygen would get pumped in and a spark would ignite the oxygen and your piston would move.
[01:49:15.719 --> 01:49:17.220]  Oxygen is explosive.
[01:49:17.400 --> 01:49:19.002]  Oxygen burns things.
[01:49:19.442 --> 01:49:22.205]  And so when you inhale... Oxygen eats metal!
[01:49:22.425 --> 01:49:23.246]  Oxygen eats metal!
[01:49:23.926 --> 01:49:33.213]  Well, oxygen is important for the burning process to take place, but without these nutrients, the oxygen burning occurs willy-nilly, and it burns everything.
[01:49:33.253 --> 01:49:34.593]  It burns metals, like you say.
[01:49:34.734 --> 01:49:36.014]  Oxidation occurs everywhere.
[01:49:36.034 --> 01:49:41.018]  The importance of nutrients is it allows this oxygen burning to take place in a controlled
[01:49:41.358 --> 01:49:42.559]  We're good to go.
[01:49:57.265 --> 01:49:57.405]  Yeah.
[01:50:27.565 --> 01:50:29.267]  That's exactly what happens.
[01:50:29.307 --> 01:50:30.227]  It's like a rusting.
[01:50:30.387 --> 01:50:32.229]  In fact, rusting is an example.
[01:50:32.729 --> 01:50:37.192]  How do you make your... If you cut an apple and you leave it out in oxygen, you leave it out in the room, it turns brown, right?
[01:50:37.212 --> 01:50:38.993]  That's a classic example of oxidation.
[01:50:39.274 --> 01:50:43.156]  You put lemon juice on the apple, which has vitamin C, it stops the oxidation from occurring.
[01:50:43.437 --> 01:50:45.278]  And that's basically what happens inside your body.
[01:50:46.067 --> 01:50:49.313]  And then you got the chicken heart studies with nutrients keeping it alive so long.
[01:50:49.654 --> 01:50:53.041]  I mean, it's real simple, but they keep it voodoo so you don't know about it.
[01:50:53.602 --> 01:50:55.446]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs is our amazing guest.
[01:50:55.526 --> 01:50:57.850]  Infowarsteam.com is where you find out more, folks.

[01:51:59.403 --> 01:52:00.644]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:00.704 --> 01:52:06.049]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:06.289 --> 01:52:10.913]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:11.313 --> 01:52:11.714]  It's true.
[01:52:11.794 --> 01:52:16.358]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:52:16.878 --> 01:52:21.581]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:22.102 --> 01:52:24.023]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:52:24.403 --> 01:52:29.027]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:52:29.207 --> 01:52:30.107]  And here's the best part.

[01:52:59.406 --> 01:53:02.889]  Most of us eat a blend of processed, man-made and all-natural food.
[01:53:03.209 --> 01:53:06.812]  But the food you eat may not provide all the nutrition your body needs.
[01:53:07.112 --> 01:53:10.955]  We now know that liquid vitamin supplements are absorbed faster than pills.
[01:53:11.275 --> 01:53:12.196]  That's why you need...

[01:54:02.054 --> 01:54:07.277]  Some of the Twitter comments coming in to Twitter.com forward slash Real Alex Jones.
[01:54:07.317 --> 01:54:08.137]  You can follow us there.
[01:54:08.958 --> 01:54:11.819]  By Joey Joe Bear in Japan.
[01:54:11.899 --> 01:54:13.720]  Yes, quake caused mass chaos.
[01:54:14.340 --> 01:54:16.101]  People poured into the streets from my apartment.
[01:54:16.141 --> 01:54:17.322]  My wife and I could see.
[01:54:20.744 --> 01:54:22.585]  Oba Baya on fire.
[01:54:23.817 --> 01:54:26.961]  We've got reports here again out of Oregon and other towns.
[01:54:27.082 --> 01:54:30.707]  Venedale Mar will decide in the next three hours whether to evacuate.
[01:54:31.708 --> 01:54:35.033]  Smaller tsunamis did hit the Hawaiian Islands.
[01:54:37.045 --> 01:54:41.086]  There was a huge whirlpool created off the coast of Japan, sucking down ships.
[01:54:41.506 --> 01:54:42.546]  We even have video of that.
[01:54:43.167 --> 01:54:45.507]  I mean, this is something out of a science fiction movie.
[01:54:45.847 --> 01:54:48.888]  But you know, truth is stranger than fiction.
[01:54:49.208 --> 01:54:50.488]  We need to pray for everybody there.
[01:54:50.508 --> 01:54:51.769]  And then the big news!
[01:54:52.369 --> 01:54:54.209]  They're now saying the reactor could be leaking.
[01:54:54.429 --> 01:54:57.010]  ABC News reports the pressure is going up.
[01:54:57.250 --> 01:55:03.572]  We're going to continue to follow reactor number one at that facility and what's happening there.
[01:55:03.872 --> 01:55:05.092]  Meanwhile, Paul Watson,
[01:55:06.772 --> 01:55:26.346]  has a big report out we'll put it on screen uh... saying no the earthquake was not caused by global warming because the BBC and everybody else are already claiming that it is unbelievable that they will seize on any tragedy to push their takeover of society and to blame it on humankind.
[01:55:26.366 --> 01:55:28.708]  I know you guys gave that to me, but just put it on screen or print it again.
[01:55:29.068 --> 01:55:29.509]  Yeah, there it is.
[01:55:29.549 --> 01:55:31.770]  Global warming did not cause the Japanese earthquake.
[01:55:32.151 --> 01:55:34.713]  BBC reporter spouts lies about
[01:55:35.413 --> 01:55:38.655]  Disappearing South Pacific Islands to imply man-made climate change.
[01:55:39.335 --> 01:55:41.116]  A connection to the devastating tsunami.
[01:55:41.656 --> 01:55:42.657]  Unbelievable evil.
[01:55:43.878 --> 01:55:45.178]  Get that out to counter these people.
[01:55:45.198 --> 01:55:47.159]  Global warming did not cause the Japanese earthquake.
[01:55:47.199 --> 01:55:48.520]  Going back to Pharmacist Ben Fuchs.
[01:55:48.980 --> 01:55:52.042]  I mean, you can find out more about Longevity and get discounts when you sign up.
[01:55:52.082 --> 01:55:52.842]  It's like $10.
[01:55:52.922 --> 01:55:53.963]  It is $10 to sign up.
[01:55:54.203 --> 01:55:55.704]  Then you get the big member discount.
[01:55:56.244 --> 01:55:57.825]  That's kind of like Costco or something.
[01:55:58.105 --> 01:56:00.526]  If you want to get friends to sign up, there is that component to it.
[01:56:00.546 --> 01:56:01.427]  If you feel like it, to get
[01:56:01.827 --> 01:56:02.747]  You know, further discounts.
[01:56:03.548 --> 01:56:05.108]  Infowarsteam.com.
[01:56:05.168 --> 01:56:05.769]  Great folks.
[01:56:06.149 --> 01:56:10.950]  We hope an army of listeners and army listeners now is out there telling their friends and family about it.
[01:56:11.070 --> 01:56:13.491]  I've bought big boxes of it and given it to friends and family.
[01:56:13.912 --> 01:56:15.132]  Great way to introduce them to it.
[01:56:15.472 --> 01:56:17.853]  The Tangy Tangerine, some of the other products.
[01:56:18.413 --> 01:56:28.537]  Ben Fuchs, going over as a pharmacist some of your favorite longevity products and what you recommend for somebody who's going to try something out just for wide spectrum, you know, natural vitamins and minerals.
[01:56:29.028 --> 01:56:29.268]  Right.
[01:56:29.408 --> 01:56:31.009]  I'll tell you the perfect product to try out.
[01:56:31.029 --> 01:56:33.892]  If you want to experience how effective this is, let me tell you something else, Alex.
[01:56:34.472 --> 01:56:42.478]  The sicker you are, the less healthy you are, the needier you are in terms of nutritional supplementation, the faster you notice results.
[01:56:42.518 --> 01:56:52.145]  That's the beautiful thing about nutritional supplementation is your body, as soon as it sees these things, if it's in a deficiency state, it will suck these materials up like a dry sponge sucks up water.
[01:56:52.165 --> 01:56:56.888]  And that's why my favorite product, and I love a lot of these products, but my favorite product is the Beyond
[01:56:57.270 --> 01:56:57.630]  Thank you!
[01:57:16.155 --> 01:57:21.081]  Is a very effective route of administration because you bypass the digestive process.
[01:57:21.401 --> 01:57:28.389]  It goes right to work and many of us are compromised through the digestive system so when you drink your nutrients you get rapid absorption.
[01:57:28.669 --> 01:57:31.031]  The Beyond Tangy Tangerine at $48.50 a month is a ridiculously
[01:57:34.395 --> 01:57:37.136]  Ridiculously cheap and effective way.
[01:57:37.196 --> 01:57:37.636]  What is that?
[01:57:37.676 --> 01:57:40.378]  Like a $1.30 a day to get everything you need?
[01:57:40.418 --> 01:57:43.639]  I'm telling you, it's not even a cup of coffee a day for $48.50.
[01:57:43.799 --> 01:57:45.820]  But what do you get for that?
[01:57:45.860 --> 01:57:53.443]  You get large doses, generous, copious amounts of vitamin A, of vitamin C, of vitamin D, of vitamin E.
[01:57:53.923 --> 01:57:59.287]  Of vitamin K, of the B vitamins, of zinc, and on and on and on in a liquid format.
[01:57:59.307 --> 01:58:07.334]  You could put it in a water bottle and drink it, and the body loves to have the nutrients delivered to it in a slow, sustained release fashion.
[01:58:07.594 --> 01:58:14.500]  And when you drink your nutrients out of a water bottle, you give your body the nutrients in this slow release fashion that your body loves.
[01:58:14.540 --> 01:58:16.001]  And how many minerals does it have in it?
[01:58:16.821 --> 01:58:17.782]  It's got all the minerals.
[01:58:17.802 --> 01:58:18.743]  92 plus.
[01:58:19.003 --> 01:58:21.065]  All plant derived, the way I explained earlier.
[01:58:22.387 --> 01:58:31.934]  And on the website, Infowarsteam.com, you can also find the phone number if you've got any questions or want to call and ask about being a member and getting a discount, or you can just buy the products there.
[01:58:32.855 --> 01:58:35.237]  I really believe in it, and your purchase supports the broadcast.

[01:58:36.818 --> 01:58:39.320]  Let's do five more minutes with Pharma Suspend Foods and Bob Chapman.

[01:59:13.630 --> 01:59:19.855]  Since 1947, Calvin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[01:59:20.155 --> 01:59:21.557]  Buy American and stay clean.

[01:59:47.960 --> 01:59:48.380]  Thank you.
[01:59:52.523 --> 01:59:54.484]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:54.904 --> 01:59:57.686]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:04.212 --> 02:00:08.434]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:09.034 --> 02:00:09.854]  You want answers?
[02:00:10.615 --> 02:00:11.515]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.155 --> 02:00:15.777]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.357 --> 02:00:20.399]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:21.934 --> 02:00:34.451]  Well, more and more Western governments are moving towards an open invasion or at least bombardment and no-fly zone of Muammar Gaddafi as their rebels are getting routed all over the country by Gaddafi right now.
[02:00:36.291 --> 02:00:40.814]  Because his intelligence apparatus wasn't totally controlled by the globalist Mike Mubarak in Egypt.
[02:00:41.355 --> 02:00:44.457]  Japan struggling to cool down nuclear plant, minister says still.
[02:00:45.218 --> 02:00:53.344]  And USA Today, Fox News are both reporting a slightly radioactive vapor is being released from the reactor.
[02:00:53.364 --> 02:00:54.445]  So they're off venting.
[02:00:54.465 --> 02:01:00.289]  And quite frankly, I can't blame them if they can't cool it by pumping water through it like they normally do.
[02:01:00.309 --> 02:01:01.310]  They gotta open it up.
[02:01:02.486 --> 02:01:06.027]  That's a lot better than that sucker completely blowing up and melting down.
[02:01:06.048 --> 02:01:09.569]  But they need to tell people to evacuate.
[02:01:09.589 --> 02:01:18.273]  They need to be telling them with the meteorologist how to get out of the line of the fallout if it does get worse.
[02:01:19.073 --> 02:01:24.375]  But now it's confirmed that some of this fallout is going on and is taking place.
[02:01:25.356 --> 02:01:27.336]  So very, very serious situation on that front.
[02:01:27.356 --> 02:01:30.798]  We're going to be breaking it down with Bob Chapman, getting into the economy and a lot more.
[02:01:31.138 --> 02:01:33.861]  And I promise, just your general phone calls on everything that's happening.
[02:01:34.461 --> 02:01:35.362]  Everybody's freaking out.
[02:01:35.402 --> 02:01:36.643]  They're harping on HAARP.
[02:01:37.023 --> 02:01:43.429]  On our email, phone calls to the office, the twitter.com forward slash realalexjones, they are saying, it's HAARP, it's HAARP, it's HAARP.
[02:01:43.749 --> 02:01:45.691]  Well, there's natural HAARP called the Sun and the Moon.
[02:01:45.711 --> 02:01:49.355]  We got hit by massive coronal ejection yesterday on top.
[02:01:50.499 --> 02:01:50.559]  of
[02:02:07.890 --> 02:02:14.472]  You had to be scheduled because I really look forward to having you on right after the Charlie Sheen thing 24 hours after we canceled that.
[02:02:14.492 --> 02:02:20.394]  Then today this meltdown, pun unfortunately intended, out in Japan.
[02:02:20.414 --> 02:02:28.176]  I look forward to having you back up in the next few weeks for a full hour to go through each mineral and what a deficiency in it does to certain parts of the body.
[02:02:28.196 --> 02:02:33.698]  I know that's where you really shine, but I'm glad you give us news about the thyroid today especially.
[02:02:34.138 --> 02:02:36.759]  I wanted to give folks the toll-free number if they want to call the
[02:02:37.399 --> 02:02:39.261]  SpecialInfoWarsTeam.com.
[02:02:39.681 --> 02:02:42.924]  Folks who are there to answer your questions about longevity.
[02:02:42.944 --> 02:02:43.904]  They're experts on it.
[02:02:43.944 --> 02:02:46.206]  Many have been involved in it for more than 15 years.
[02:02:46.226 --> 02:02:48.108]  So I wouldn't call them operators.
[02:02:48.168 --> 02:02:49.069]  I'd call them specialists.
[02:02:49.089 --> 02:02:49.489]  877-551-1301.
[02:02:49.509 --> 02:02:51.431]  If it's busy, leave your name and number.
[02:02:51.491 --> 02:02:52.972]  They'll call you back.
[02:02:52.992 --> 02:02:53.512]  877-551-1301 or InfoWarsTeam.com.
[02:02:59.797 --> 02:03:01.279]  And I want folks to get involved in this.
[02:03:01.399 --> 02:03:03.362]  You get a discount when you sign up and pay ten bucks.
[02:03:03.382 --> 02:03:07.027]  You can get others to sign up and spread the word or just buy it and give it to friends and family.
[02:03:07.307 --> 02:03:08.629]  The point is, get people to try it.
[02:03:08.909 --> 02:03:13.335]  Then they'll understand how really good these nutrients are and how deficient most people are.
[02:03:13.776 --> 02:03:16.058]  In closing, Ben, any other comments you want to make?
[02:03:16.653 --> 02:03:22.235]  Look, if you feel, folks, if you feel like you're mad and you're not going to take it anymore, this is a message for you.
[02:03:22.296 --> 02:03:32.380]  If you're sick and tired of being sick and tired, if you're on pharmaceuticals and it just doesn't feel right, if you've had it with doctors and drugs and HMOs and hospitals and health insurance and
[02:03:32.860 --> 02:03:34.161]  Medicine and the medical model.
[02:03:34.221 --> 02:03:35.601]  This is a message for you.
[02:03:35.661 --> 02:03:36.282]  It's logical.
[02:03:36.402 --> 02:03:37.002]  It's sensible.
[02:03:37.422 --> 02:03:38.223]  It's alternative.
[02:03:38.383 --> 02:03:39.343]  And it's really very simple.
[02:03:39.663 --> 02:03:41.304]  It's a matter of being rational and logical.
[02:03:41.344 --> 02:03:42.685]  The drugs are not working.
[02:03:42.725 --> 02:03:47.587]  The drugs are leaving the dysfunction behind and they're painting over the rotting framework.
[02:03:47.867 --> 02:03:50.948]  Nutritional supplementation is what your body is craving.
[02:03:51.309 --> 02:03:56.071]  It's what your body is crying out for and this is an ultimate act of love for your body.
[02:03:57.279 --> 02:03:58.000]  Absolutely.
[02:03:58.300 --> 02:04:00.442]  And again, not just the Beyond Tangy Tangerine.
[02:04:00.462 --> 02:04:01.403]  That's a great way to start.
[02:04:01.703 --> 02:04:05.386]  What are some of the other products you think are the best at InfoWarsTeam.com?
[02:04:05.786 --> 02:04:07.788]  The Beyond Tangy Tangerine is the first one.
[02:04:07.828 --> 02:04:10.310]  Then, of course, there's the essential fatty acids.
[02:04:10.370 --> 02:04:14.994]  And one of the most important nutritional deficiencies, one of the most significant nutritional deficiencies we have
[02:04:15.285 --> 02:04:15.645]  We're good to go!
[02:04:37.927 --> 02:04:42.231]  All right, Pharmacist Ben Fuchs, thank you for working with us at Infowarsteam.com.
[02:04:42.251 --> 02:04:51.418]  The number of folks who want to call and learn more or talk to an actual person, 877-551-1301, 877-551-1301.
[02:04:51.798 --> 02:04:59.364]  Bob Chapman, all the latest on the reactor situation, the tsunami, the rising death toll, the wave coming towards the West Coast.
[02:04:59.384 --> 02:04:59.745]  Stay with us.
[02:05:00.819 --> 02:05:04.441]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:05:04.821 --> 02:05:07.843]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:05:08.083 --> 02:05:12.846]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:05:12.866 --> 02:05:19.109]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:05:19.249 --> 02:05:21.491]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:05:22.051 --> 02:05:23.172]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:05:23.192 --> 02:05:23.952]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:05:23.972 --> 02:05:25.654]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:05:40.945 --> 02:05:44.866]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[02:05:45.326 --> 02:05:47.887]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:05:48.207 --> 02:05:57.330]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:06:00.706 --> 02:06:07.388]  Alex has told you that the Mideast uprisings over food prices and shortages caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide.
[02:06:07.749 --> 02:06:09.989]  We're seeing the impact right here in the United States.
[02:06:10.410 --> 02:06:19.213]  Ethanol, that was supposed to reduce petroleum use and fuel prices, hit a 30-month high in February, and pump prices are expected to reach $5 a gallon.
[02:06:19.453 --> 02:06:27.356]  Because of shipping costs, food is being priced out of the reach of millions of Americans, with an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days.
[02:06:27.696 --> 02:06:28.336]  Move quickly!
[02:06:28.456 --> 02:06:32.559]  Well, you can still afford it, and eFoods Direct will pay your shipping costs for you.

[02:06:59.142 --> 02:07:00.283]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:07:00.303 --> 02:07:06.988]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:07:07.248 --> 02:07:09.530]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:07:09.810 --> 02:07:14.974]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:07:15.174 --> 02:07:17.955]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:07:18.215 --> 02:07:20.316]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:07:20.536 --> 02:07:26.458]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:07:26.778 --> 02:07:29.980]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:07:30.160 --> 02:07:35.682]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:07:35.942 --> 02:07:37.262]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:07:37.583 --> 02:07:38.743]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:07:38.883 --> 02:07:41.404]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:07:41.564 --> 02:07:45.606]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:07:45.766 --> 02:07:50.268]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[02:07:50.388 --> 02:07:52.849]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[02:07:52.989 --> 02:07:56.691]  Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[02:07:56.851 --> 02:07:58.111]  That's endofamerica3.com.
[02:07:58.211 --> 02:08:00.312]  I can see the whirlwind behind you.
[02:08:00.332 --> 02:08:04.674]  Let's talk to Professor Jun Tsuji of the Tokyo University Earthquake Research Institute.
[02:08:04.714 --> 02:08:08.836]  Mr. Tsuji, this is the current state of the sea in Oarai Town, Ibaraki Prefecture.
[02:08:12.218 --> 02:08:25.635]  Unbelievable footage if you're watching on PrisonPlanet.TV of a gigantic whirlpool sucking in boats and ships and debris.
[02:08:25.855 --> 02:08:27.958]  Part of the huge tidal wave.
[02:08:29.059 --> 02:08:29.279]  That's
[02:08:44.676 --> 02:08:47.418]  I mean, this is just beyond bizarre.
[02:08:47.858 --> 02:08:57.044]  And then devastating footage of entire areas of cities like matchsticks, buildings and homes, and undoubtedly tens of thousands dying.
[02:08:57.384 --> 02:09:08.851]  They're now saying it's above a thousand found dead, but the disaster is still ongoing with water just now receding hours later and fires all over the ravaged area.
[02:09:09.791 --> 02:09:12.153]  There are six nuclear reactors in one.
[02:09:13.550 --> 02:09:22.855]  Complex, and it is being reported widely by CNN, Fox, USA Today.
[02:09:23.416 --> 02:09:25.717]  The Japanese government is on record.
[02:09:26.177 --> 02:09:29.179]  Japan struggling to cool down nuclear plant, minister says.
[02:09:29.599 --> 02:09:42.026]  Officials ordered an evacuation Friday of residents living near a Japanese nuclear power plant, saying there has been no sign yet of leaks, indicating a struggle to cool down one of the atomic facilities.
[02:09:43.052 --> 02:09:52.902]  Now, that was before they came out in USA Today, minutes after that, and said Japan to release slightly radioactive vapor, because they got to open it up somehow.
[02:09:52.962 --> 02:09:55.805]  The water is not getting through, the coolant isn't getting through.
[02:09:55.825 --> 02:09:56.847]  The U.S.
[02:09:56.887 --> 02:10:00.230]  military has got nuclear submarine facilities nearby.
[02:10:00.691 --> 02:10:02.012]  Just wonder what happened to them.
[02:10:02.633 --> 02:10:05.315]  Just delivered some of the special coolant.
[02:10:06.276 --> 02:10:08.717]  Um, that they're not revealing what type, but it's not water.
[02:10:08.737 --> 02:10:10.338]  Uh, and they're saying the U.S.
[02:10:10.358 --> 02:10:12.839]  military is standing by to assist the Japanese.
[02:10:13.339 --> 02:10:14.759]  Now, that's also in the Associated Press.
[02:10:15.099 --> 02:10:20.781]  Japanese authorities will release slightly radioactive vapor to release pressure at a disabled nuclear power plant.
[02:10:21.182 --> 02:10:24.283]  Well, it's probably either that than have it go Chernobyl, so release, release.
[02:10:24.823 --> 02:10:26.283]  That's the problem with nuclear reactors.
[02:10:26.323 --> 02:10:27.224]  Why not go with coal?
[02:10:28.237 --> 02:10:28.957]  Hydroelectric?
[02:10:28.997 --> 02:10:29.757]  I mean, come on.
[02:10:30.257 --> 02:10:43.860]  Japan's nuclear safety agency said pressure inside one of the six boiling water reactors at the Fukushima plant had risen 1.5 times the level considered normal in associated press reports.
[02:10:44.320 --> 02:10:45.220]  It's still rising.
[02:10:45.621 --> 02:10:47.561]  They're unable to cool it as of minutes ago.
[02:10:48.001 --> 02:10:52.142]  The agency said the radioactive element in the vapor would not affect the environment or human health.
[02:10:52.802 --> 02:10:54.723]  They told you the dust was safe at Ground Zero, too.
[02:10:55.223 --> 02:10:56.543]  Why not just tell the truth, guys?
[02:10:57.244 --> 02:11:02.906]  Officials have declared Japan's first ever nuclear emergency and ordered the evacuation of 3,000 nearby residents.
[02:11:03.266 --> 02:11:07.247]  They've had events where they've had purifying units blow up.
[02:11:07.287 --> 02:11:07.767]  Remember that?
[02:11:08.268 --> 02:11:09.228]  And they just cover it up.
[02:11:09.348 --> 02:11:11.309]  I mean, who knows what's really going on?
[02:11:11.329 --> 02:11:13.810]  And of course, they're not telling the locals to evacuate.
[02:11:15.330 --> 02:11:17.811]  And the locals are reportedly sitting there waiting for orders.
[02:11:18.771 --> 02:11:19.051]  Get out.
[02:11:19.091 --> 02:11:19.212]  Go.
[02:11:21.920 --> 02:11:22.441]  Upwind.
[02:11:22.521 --> 02:11:23.021]  Get out.
[02:11:23.181 --> 02:11:24.362]  You don't want to be downwind of this.
[02:11:24.442 --> 02:11:28.545]  Go the opposite direction of the way the wind's going to blow.
[02:11:28.805 --> 02:11:29.826]  Let's hope it doesn't happen.
[02:11:30.026 --> 02:11:31.247]  Probably not going to melt down.
[02:11:31.267 --> 02:11:32.028]  Let's be positive.
[02:11:32.048 --> 02:11:32.749]  Let's pray about it.
[02:11:33.129 --> 02:11:33.609]  Let's hope.
[02:11:35.311 --> 02:11:38.653]  But I mean, let's say there's a 5% chance, a 10% chance it's going to melt down.
[02:11:38.953 --> 02:11:39.674]  And go Chernobyl.
[02:11:40.415 --> 02:11:41.415]  Get out of there!
[02:11:42.156 --> 02:11:42.736]  Get out of there!
[02:11:43.037 --> 02:11:45.919]  Bob Chapman joins us every Friday.
[02:11:47.060 --> 02:11:48.821]  It seems like every 10 minutes he's on.
[02:11:48.861 --> 02:11:50.603]  It seems like these weeks just
[02:11:52.213 --> 02:11:53.814]  These weeks just go by every second.
[02:11:54.734 --> 02:11:56.855]  I never read Bob Chapman's bio, but I'm going to do it now.
[02:11:57.976 --> 02:12:00.037]  By the way, the toll-free number to join us on air is 800-259-9231.
[02:12:00.057 --> 02:12:11.523]  We're also going to get into the big developments in North Africa, the Middle East, Saudi Arabia, the riots going on, one of the biggest bond houses in the world saying they're not going to buy dollars anymore.
[02:12:13.271 --> 02:12:17.334]  But Bob Chapman was in military intelligence and became a stockbroker in 1960, retired in 88.
[02:12:18.315 --> 02:12:20.757]  For 18 of those years he owned his own brokerage firm.
[02:12:20.797 --> 02:12:24.740]  He's probably the largest gold and silver stockbroker in the world during that period.
[02:12:24.780 --> 02:12:27.422]  When he retired he had over 6,000 clients.
[02:12:27.802 --> 02:12:31.325]  From 62 to 76 he specialized in South African gold shares.
[02:12:31.786 --> 02:12:35.729]  He and his family lived in Salisbury, Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe.
[02:12:36.429 --> 02:12:39.832]  And Johannesburg, South Africa, and he lived in France and everywhere else.
[02:12:39.892 --> 02:12:40.953]  I'm not going to go over the whole thing.
[02:12:41.353 --> 02:12:43.856]  He helped publish None Dare Call a Conspiracy with Gary Allen.
[02:12:44.136 --> 02:12:50.201]  He's been fighting the globalists for almost 50 years, just like Dr. Stan Monteith, who will vouch that Bob's been an icon from the very beginning.
[02:12:50.942 --> 02:12:52.943]  He co-owned the Gary Allen Report.
[02:12:53.864 --> 02:12:58.988]  Gary Allen's son now started and runs Politico, I should add, which had 30,000 subscribers.
[02:13:00.369 --> 02:13:05.413]  And he is currently the owner of the International Forecaster, which reaches people in more than 80 countries.
[02:13:05.713 --> 02:13:07.074]  This is an old bio, it says 60.
[02:13:07.635 --> 02:13:09.476]  And the internationalforecaster.com.
[02:13:09.817 --> 02:13:12.719]  Bob, all bedlam has broken loose.
[02:13:13.019 --> 02:13:15.301]  They're talking about evacuating areas of Oregon.
[02:13:15.321 --> 02:13:17.743]  I don't know why not Washington or California.
[02:13:19.501 --> 02:13:25.607]  Uh, but in my experience, if a tsunami happens 5,000 miles away, it's normally going to dissipate, but who knows?
[02:13:25.627 --> 02:13:27.308]  It might be a problem for cruise ships out there.
[02:13:27.348 --> 02:13:33.774]  We know some larger waves, tsunami-style, did come in on the beach and caused some limited damage in the Hawaiian Islands.
[02:13:34.935 --> 02:13:37.998]  But a lot of crazy things going on there.
[02:13:50.011 --> 02:13:50.391]  I don't
[02:14:12.254 --> 02:14:12.594]  I don't
[02:14:36.388 --> 02:14:41.190]  Well, I think we have to accelerate the departure of Al Gore to wherever he's going in Haiti, for a starter.
[02:14:41.210 --> 02:14:41.450]  Thank you.
[02:14:41.490 --> 02:14:42.951]  And I've got to say this.
[02:14:42.971 --> 02:14:46.172]  I've been doing vitamins, minerals, herbs, and hormones for 47 years.
[02:15:06.939 --> 02:15:13.803]  I check up at the doctor once a year and he looked at me yesterday and he said, there's something wrong with you.
[02:15:13.823 --> 02:15:15.264]  And I said, what?
[02:15:16.004 --> 02:15:19.906]  He said, your blood pressure is 115 over 70.
[02:15:20.387 --> 02:15:22.848]  How can that be for a man your age?
[02:15:23.528 --> 02:15:32.333]  Anyway, that's what comes of taking care of yourself and using preventive things that are being discussed on Alex's program.
[02:15:32.874 --> 02:15:35.135]  And I thank you for doing it because it works.
[02:15:36.192 --> 02:15:37.453]  And you plug that everywhere.
[02:15:37.473 --> 02:15:52.042]  I've heard you on Coast to Coast AM and other shows, and you'll be talking about, you know, the economy, and you'll say, excuse me, George, or excuse me, the other host, I just heard an ad for, you know, prostate plant extract.
[02:15:52.422 --> 02:15:53.903]  Boy, let me tell you, it works great.
[02:15:54.243 --> 02:15:59.346]  But then even the mainline studies show that that particular plant, I forget which one it is, has
[02:16:01.067 --> 02:16:12.796]  Four or five times in the studies what the expensive drugs have, but the doctors won't tell them, because the bottle of it's $10 instead of $1,000 a month, or the, you know, the cancer surgery they want to give you.
[02:16:12.816 --> 02:16:14.097]  What's the prostate thing you take?
[02:16:16.298 --> 02:16:24.124]  Beta-prostate, and it's Roger Mason's product, and Roger is a subscriber for many years.
[02:16:24.204 --> 02:16:29.168]  I've been taking it, I think, for 18 years, and I'm 75, and everything still works.
[02:16:29.773 --> 02:16:31.054]  And I've never had a problem.
[02:16:31.454 --> 02:16:35.636]  In fact, when they do the specific antigen test, they say, we can't believe this.
[02:16:36.496 --> 02:16:41.398]  And I forget, there's a couple plants, and I know in that one they combo them together to cause that amplifying effect.
[02:16:41.698 --> 02:16:46.680]  What's the plant that they admit is like magic for your prostate, but the doctors won't tell you to take it?
[02:16:47.941 --> 02:16:48.561]  I don't know.
[02:16:48.861 --> 02:16:50.002]  I gotta be honest.
[02:16:50.082 --> 02:16:51.402]  Sol Palmetto, that's right.
[02:16:51.422 --> 02:16:52.463]  And then there's one more.
[02:16:52.483 --> 02:16:54.844]  Yeah, Sol, but this is far more powerful than that.
[02:16:55.644 --> 02:16:56.585]  And it really works.
[02:16:58.078 --> 02:17:06.463]  Roger advertises on this network, and many others, and all of his products are very good.
[02:17:06.844 --> 02:17:07.704]  And I take them all.
[02:17:08.965 --> 02:17:10.166]  And we do it every day.
[02:17:10.186 --> 02:17:14.068]  I didn't even know he sponsored us, but I know he sponsors everything, basically.
[02:17:14.388 --> 02:17:22.773]  Alright, now Bob, shifting gears now, what do you make of the reactor that they said they're going to release radiation from, and they can't get coolant into it?
[02:17:22.793 --> 02:17:23.494]  That's pretty scary.
[02:17:24.881 --> 02:17:35.164]  It certainly is, especially for the people of Japan who had to go through that terrible experience at the end of the Second World War.
[02:17:35.924 --> 02:17:39.845]  And it was awful, and everybody knows that.
[02:17:40.525 --> 02:17:46.427]  And it's just like, you know, the ghost of Hiroshima and Nagasaki coming back.
[02:17:46.887 --> 02:17:51.048]  I sure hope that they can get this thing fixed, and I think they can.
[02:17:51.909 --> 02:17:54.750]  And so, as you said, let's pray that it works.
[02:17:55.490 --> 02:17:56.950]  These people don't deserve this.
[02:17:58.351 --> 02:17:58.931]  Nobody does.
[02:18:00.211 --> 02:18:04.092]  But anyway, the damage will be unbelievable.
[02:18:04.952 --> 02:18:10.053]  And I'm not an expert, so I don't know what cost it.
[02:18:11.154 --> 02:18:15.495]  Probably the gentleman that you had on, the expert who described it.
[02:18:18.295 --> 02:18:19.716]  I'm getting letters about HAARP.
[02:18:21.329 --> 02:18:21.769]  I don't know.
[02:18:21.849 --> 02:18:23.170]  I'm not an expert on that.
[02:18:23.891 --> 02:18:27.854]  And so, I think they're going to need help, too.
[02:18:29.208 --> 02:18:30.770]  Well, Bob, I mean, look.
[02:18:31.270 --> 02:18:37.336]  Harp is a little tinker toy made by man trying to compete with God's harp, the sun and moon.
[02:18:37.956 --> 02:18:40.178]  I mean, what do people think that they're magnetic fields?
[02:18:40.218 --> 02:18:42.501]  We got hit by a giant solar flare, two of them.
[02:18:43.061 --> 02:18:49.967]  At the same time, the moon's the closest to the earth it's been in 19 years, which they admit pulls the magma, not just the oceans.
[02:18:49.987 --> 02:18:51.649]  That's what causes... Folks, this is a 100% fact.
[02:18:52.890 --> 02:18:55.011]  The moon is what controls the ocean's tides.
[02:18:55.351 --> 02:18:56.711]  It also pulls the magma.
[02:18:57.231 --> 02:18:59.912]  Scientists know that the magnetic field changes with the moon.
[02:19:00.352 --> 02:19:06.434]  So, that's what did it, but Al Gore, again, says, pay him money, that we caused it.
[02:19:08.875 --> 02:19:15.677]  Well, you know, it was just a couple of days ago we saw the eruptions in Hawaii at the volcanoes.
[02:19:16.757 --> 02:19:21.679]  And to professionals, that should have been a giant clue that there was trouble on the way.
[02:19:23.339 --> 02:19:28.566]  Well, I mean, Japan didn't build its houses out of paper because they've never had an earthquake or a tsunami before.
[02:19:29.667 --> 02:19:34.073]  And just how dumb does Al Gore and the UN and BBC think we are?
[02:19:34.634 --> 02:19:37.417]  For those that don't know, Watson's got an article documenting it.
[02:19:37.938 --> 02:19:40.000]  They're saying man caused the earthquake.
[02:19:41.109 --> 02:19:46.331]  So they can make us guilty and say we're bad and say we're demons and attack us.
[02:19:46.471 --> 02:19:48.692]  I mean, there's no end to these criminals.
[02:19:48.732 --> 02:19:49.873]  They want to make us guilty.
[02:19:50.433 --> 02:19:52.274]  You're racist if you don't turn your guns in.
[02:19:52.354 --> 02:19:54.215]  You're racist if you don't accept government health care.
[02:19:54.575 --> 02:19:56.116]  You're racist if you don't lick our boots.
[02:19:56.576 --> 02:19:59.077]  We'll talk about the Gaddafi situation and take your phone calls.
[02:20:01.820 --> 02:20:02.961]  This is not a drill.
[02:20:03.041 --> 02:20:05.042]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[02:20:05.562 --> 02:20:07.143]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[02:20:07.463 --> 02:20:14.566]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[02:20:14.667 --> 02:20:19.029]  Now, a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[02:20:19.069 --> 02:20:29.314]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them, how to create the perfect hiding place, as well as the places you should never hide your guns.
[02:20:29.554 --> 02:20:31.115]  Under any circumstance.
[02:20:31.195 --> 02:20:38.078]  These and other closely guarded gun caching secrets are guaranteed to keep your weapons safe and out of sight when the going gets tough.
[02:20:38.418 --> 02:20:39.078]  But listen up.
[02:20:39.098 --> 02:20:45.301]  For security reasons, the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time.
[02:20:45.361 --> 02:20:47.161]  Go to hideyourguns.com.
[02:20:47.201 --> 02:20:49.282]  That's hideyourguns.com.
[02:20:49.362 --> 02:20:49.843]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[02:20:49.863 --> 02:20:51.703]  Before they come for your guns.
[02:20:51.743 --> 02:20:52.143]  Hideyourguns.com.
[02:20:52.163 --> 02:20:52.404]  Right now.
[02:20:59.278 --> 02:21:05.521]  Don't you just laugh every time the news plays another story about a foreclosure bank or attorney under investigation, bankrupted or being sued?
[02:21:05.881 --> 02:21:11.424]  Zero Debt has a program that stops foreclosure, guaranteed for at least two years, without payments or attorneys.
[02:21:11.664 --> 02:21:17.167]  In fact, we show our members how to get the banks to pay their taxes and insurance while they stonewall the bank's collection process.
[02:21:17.327 --> 02:21:21.909]  We show you how it's possible to quiet the title in your name by using the bank's very own foreclosure process.
[02:21:22.109 --> 02:21:23.530]  Loan modification is a joke.
[02:21:23.670 --> 02:21:27.272]  The banks use that to take your money with nothing in return and keeping you in default.
[02:21:27.492 --> 02:21:28.533]  You've heard our ad before.
[02:21:28.633 --> 02:21:31.274]  We are not investors, bankers, attorneys, or real estate agents.

[02:21:50.484 --> 02:21:51.765]  Guaranteed to stop foreclosure.
[02:22:00.333 --> 02:22:03.495]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.

[02:22:28.667 --> 02:22:29.748]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:29.928 --> 02:22:34.311]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:22:34.491 --> 02:22:40.195]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:22:40.295 --> 02:22:43.697]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:22:43.937 --> 02:22:48.680]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:48.801 --> 02:22:51.562]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[02:22:52.043 --> 02:22:53.364]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:59.127 --> 02:23:01.348]  The food storage industry leader has done it again.
[02:23:01.608 --> 02:23:05.709]  Introducing FDG Clubs and Survival Bucks from the Freeze-Dry Guy.

[02:23:46.101 --> 02:23:48.162]  That's FreezeDryGuy.com or call 866-404-3663.
[02:23:48.182 --> 02:23:49.063]  The Freeze Dry Guy.
[02:23:49.103 --> 02:23:49.823]  The best you can buy.
[02:24:15.293 --> 02:24:23.419]  Well, Muammar Gaddafi has taken several towns and cities back and is basically marching on Benghazi and areas in the east.
[02:24:24.720 --> 02:24:28.162]  There's no doubt now he's turned the tide against the globalist-backed rebels.
[02:24:28.662 --> 02:24:30.364]  So he's a smaller, local demon.
[02:24:31.547 --> 02:24:32.608]  Fighting against Satan.
[02:24:32.628 --> 02:24:36.871]  And it's all part of the larger globalist plan.
[02:24:37.372 --> 02:24:40.034]  Saudi Arabia's into several weeks of rioting.
[02:24:40.634 --> 02:24:41.735]  Talk of collapsing.
[02:24:41.815 --> 02:24:42.916]  Tanks on the streets.
[02:24:44.117 --> 02:24:45.538]  Other countries are rioting.
[02:24:46.619 --> 02:24:47.940]  Oil prices have been shooting up.
[02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:49.021]  Gold's shooting up now.
[02:24:49.361 --> 02:24:50.322]  Correcting a bit.
[02:24:51.263 --> 02:24:52.304]  All of this happening.
[02:24:52.884 --> 02:24:54.966]  And then we had the big bond house.
[02:24:55.026 --> 02:24:55.947]  I covered it yesterday.
[02:24:56.007 --> 02:24:57.148]  Bloomberg broke it.
[02:24:58.669 --> 02:25:01.530]  Well, first they said the biggest, and some said one of the biggest.
[02:25:02.331 --> 02:25:09.394]  Brokerage houses, investment funds in the world, and Bob Chapman can talk about this first, has said no more dollars, no more T-bills.
[02:25:09.834 --> 02:25:10.394]  We're done.
[02:25:10.854 --> 02:25:15.757]  And then you had Wall Street Journal on Monday saying the end of the dollar is nigh, and that it was a good thing.
[02:25:15.777 --> 02:25:17.097]  It was going to be good for us, Bob.
[02:25:17.417 --> 02:25:23.220]  Like jumping into a meat grinder, or jumping off a cliff, or playing in traffic, or eating cyanide, or slitting our wrists.
[02:25:23.300 --> 02:25:23.820]  It's wonderful.
[02:25:24.520 --> 02:25:27.962]  What's your take on all the crazy things that are going on?
[02:25:29.622 --> 02:25:35.308]  Well, Bill Gross is essentially a professional gambler.
[02:25:36.289 --> 02:25:42.394]  He is the head of PIMCO, and they are the largest bond house in the world.
[02:25:43.035 --> 02:25:44.897]  They're owned by Allianz out of Germany.
[02:25:46.098 --> 02:25:49.561]  And Bill knows how to figure the odds.
[02:25:50.142 --> 02:25:53.966]  He's a great trader, enormously successful.
[02:25:54.816 --> 02:26:08.023]  Worked very closely in helping the government when they went through their trying times two to three years ago and bought lots and lots of bonds for them to help them along.
[02:26:08.943 --> 02:26:20.509]  And so for him to exit his treasuries, and I'm sure he's out of his agency bonds as well, those are the bonds from Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Jimmy and FHA.
[02:26:21.630 --> 02:26:23.631]  It's an extremely significant event.
[02:26:24.269 --> 02:26:30.414]  What he's saying is, I see down the road here that we're going to have lots of inflation.
[02:26:31.494 --> 02:26:40.081]  The United States government has piles of debt, and most of it is being purchased by the Federal Reserve, who makes money up out of thin air.
[02:26:40.921 --> 02:26:41.942]  And that's not very good.
[02:26:42.663 --> 02:26:46.506]  So he doesn't want to have any part of that, and that's super intelligent.
[02:26:48.167 --> 02:26:50.509]  But I wouldn't expect anything less from him.
[02:26:51.890 --> 02:26:53.651]  He's among the best.
[02:26:55.979 --> 02:27:12.496]  At the same time, Carl Icahn, who is a money manager and a professional in the business of buying out companies and all sorts of corporate finance.
[02:27:13.517 --> 02:27:17.201]  He's in his 80s and he's had a magnificent career.
[02:27:18.126 --> 02:27:21.269]  He shut down his hedge fund at about the same time.
[02:27:21.449 --> 02:27:21.990]  That's right.
[02:27:22.230 --> 02:27:29.576]  Four days ago, we have the Wall Street Journal, Time Magazine, a whole bunch of others come out and say the dollar will be dead.
[02:27:30.037 --> 02:27:36.002]  The Chinese announced they're no longer going to accept dollars to buy their finished retail goods.
[02:27:37.341 --> 02:27:41.386]  We now have ex-Goldman Sachs analyst saying major war coming at end of 2012.
[02:27:41.446 --> 02:27:44.891]  That's a PrisonPlanet.com article with the video.
[02:27:45.632 --> 02:27:48.335]  We have the Chinese president saying the end of the dollar is nigh.
[02:27:49.217 --> 02:27:52.281]  We've got one of the other biggest bond traders and investors, as you said,
[02:27:53.462 --> 02:27:56.744]  Telling his investors, I don't want to be in the stock market right now.
[02:27:57.244 --> 02:28:05.329]  I mean, and this isn't Henry Paulson out there trying to create a correction or a crisis to panic folks to give him trillions.
[02:28:05.709 --> 02:28:14.375]  They're just quietly exiting the room and it's kind of like when a party starts to end, one person leaves and suddenly a few others do and then suddenly everybody's leaving.
[02:28:14.875 --> 02:28:17.597]  Are we reaching that point where everybody's starting to get up to leave the party?
[02:28:19.978 --> 02:28:20.959]  No, but some are.
[02:28:22.075 --> 02:28:26.999]  The very introspective, outside-the-box thinkers.
[02:28:27.820 --> 02:28:28.981]  And you've got two of them there.
[02:28:29.762 --> 02:28:38.889]  And what Carl actually said was, I don't want to be responsible for these people's future and their losses if that were to occur.
[02:28:39.029 --> 02:28:41.811]  Yeah, that was the quote.
[02:28:41.831 --> 02:28:45.114]  So what he's in essence saying, look, let's get out of the way.
[02:28:45.154 --> 02:28:46.375]  There's some bad stuff coming.
[02:28:48.016 --> 02:28:48.577]  Very simple.
[02:28:49.730 --> 02:28:58.593]  And so you put it together with the other things that you've mentioned and the things that I write about every week and talk about every week on programs.
[02:28:59.573 --> 02:29:01.494]  And we've got dire problems.
[02:29:01.514 --> 02:29:02.474]  The whole world has.
[02:29:03.154 --> 02:29:05.795]  But ours and England's and Europe's are the worst.
[02:29:06.715 --> 02:29:14.298]  And I think we're going to find that China and Japan are going to be coming close behind us with many other nations.
[02:29:15.086 --> 02:29:17.948]  There will be nations that won't get hit too bad.
[02:29:17.988 --> 02:29:18.308]  Go ahead.
[02:29:18.508 --> 02:29:21.650]  No, no, we'll come back after the break, but I saw that article earlier in the week.
[02:29:22.071 --> 02:29:23.131]  I barely mentioned it.
[02:29:23.652 --> 02:29:28.995]  Give us the name of the traitor again, because he's a top guy, and those were exact quotes you were giving.
[02:29:29.256 --> 02:29:30.837]  I want to pull the article up during the break.
[02:29:30.877 --> 02:29:31.577]  Who was the other guy?
[02:29:32.758 --> 02:29:33.579]  Carl Icahn.
[02:29:35.260 --> 02:29:37.941]  And the other is Bill Gross.
[02:29:38.202 --> 02:29:39.042]  I know that.
[02:29:39.082 --> 02:29:40.063]  Bill is with Pemco.
[02:29:40.143 --> 02:29:41.324]  I know the Pemco.
[02:29:42.466 --> 02:29:47.530]  Yeah, but the Carl Icahn, the headline was, no longer managing investors' stocks.
[02:29:47.550 --> 02:29:49.071]  Can we get that, folks, please?
[02:29:49.812 --> 02:29:50.712]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.193 --> 02:29:52.794]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.715 --> 02:29:56.417]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.577 --> 02:30:03.520]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:30:03.740 --> 02:30:09.784]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:30:10.164 --> 02:30:17.248]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:30:17.549 --> 02:30:22.132]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[02:30:31.080 --> 02:30:34.785]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[02:30:35.325 --> 02:30:41.511]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[02:30:42.092 --> 02:30:45.515]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[02:30:45.995 --> 02:30:53.303]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[02:30:53.423 --> 02:30:53.883]  Thank you.
[02:31:00.199 --> 02:31:14.669]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[02:31:15.669 --> 02:31:19.352]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:20.359 --> 02:31:32.372]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:31:33.133 --> 02:31:40.400]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[02:31:41.081 --> 02:31:50.686]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[02:31:51.447 --> 02:31:54.709]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[02:31:55.369 --> 02:31:58.491]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[02:31:59.031 --> 02:32:03.272]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:32:03.592 --> 02:32:04.192]  Number 1.
[02:32:04.512 --> 02:32:07.653]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:32:07.933 --> 02:32:08.473]  Number 2.
[02:32:08.793 --> 02:32:13.334]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:32:13.674 --> 02:32:14.114]  It's true.
[02:32:14.414 --> 02:32:18.975]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:32:19.295 --> 02:32:19.835]  Number 3.
[02:32:20.115 --> 02:32:23.396]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:32:23.696 --> 02:32:27.397]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:32:27.617 --> 02:32:28.158]  Number 4.
[02:32:28.398 --> 02:32:30.780]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:32:31.160 --> 02:32:34.544]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:32:34.844 --> 02:32:35.064]  Number 5.
[02:32:35.645 --> 02:32:39.568]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:32:39.788 --> 02:32:44.553]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:32:44.833 --> 02:32:48.856]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:48.996 --> 02:32:50.557]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:50.797 --> 02:32:52.879]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:32:53.039 --> 02:32:55.381]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:33:10.967 --> 02:33:12.930]  There's the headline out of Reuters.
[02:33:13.471 --> 02:33:15.915]  Carl Icahn to return his client's money.
[02:33:16.943 --> 02:33:29.830]  Billionaire hedge fund manager Carl Icahn is returning capital to outside investors, marking the end of an era as he joins other prominent stock pickers who no longer want the headaches of handling other people's money.
[02:33:30.210 --> 02:33:33.952]  But when you actually read his quotes, that's Reuters spin.
[02:33:33.992 --> 02:33:36.413]  It's not, oh, the headaches of billions he makes.
[02:33:36.493 --> 02:33:37.774]  No, he says it's too dangerous.
[02:33:37.794 --> 02:33:40.876]  In fact, I'll go to the quotes after Bob continues.
[02:33:42.357 --> 02:33:44.958]  And he just says he doesn't want to hurt people.
[02:33:44.998 --> 02:33:45.779]  He's saying get out.
[02:33:46.279 --> 02:33:47.720]  And then I've seen the numbers, Bob.
[02:33:47.760 --> 02:33:48.641]  Can you quantify these?
[02:33:48.661 --> 02:33:50.602]  But I've seen even mainstream articles about it.
[02:33:51.182 --> 02:34:01.169]  That insiders are getting out of the market at five times the numbers that newbies and the general public and government investments are getting in with people's pension funds.
[02:34:01.609 --> 02:34:04.832]  So the big money is creeping away to the exits, correct?
[02:34:06.133 --> 02:34:09.455]  That is absolutely correct and it's been going on for about a year.
[02:34:10.692 --> 02:34:14.213]  And sometimes the numbers are like 342 to 1.
[02:34:14.593 --> 02:34:26.076]  I mean, there might be $50,000 worth of options exercised in how long against the sale of $4,800,000,000 or something.
[02:34:26.496 --> 02:34:32.158]  I mean, the figures are staggering of people who run companies getting out of the market.
[02:34:34.605 --> 02:34:47.514]  So they're just propping things up long enough by printing trillions of dollars in other currencies worldwide to get themselves and their armored redoubts, to get their bodyguards, to get ready to kind of turn their SWAT teams loose on us.
[02:34:48.015 --> 02:34:59.723]  They create the crisis, society implodes, they sit back, turn the SWAT teams and troops loose on us, and then they emerge prancing around as the saviors later, and they're really gearing up for it.
[02:35:01.690 --> 02:35:13.216]  I think you're right, and what you've just said is correct, although if they're going to use people, they're going to have to use mercenaries.
[02:35:14.237 --> 02:35:20.320]  And I've talked to too many people in the military, they won't take an illegal order, and they're not going to shoot American citizens.
[02:35:21.260 --> 02:35:28.344]  And maybe mercenaries would, but you know, we don't have to go over the figures again, but America's armed to the teeth.
[02:35:31.292 --> 02:35:34.214]  You could bring in 10 million troops and they'd still lose.
[02:35:34.495 --> 02:35:45.923]  Well, suddenly mainstream news is reporting like they're talking about the weather or the price of gasoline at the corner market or when they're going to have a Christmas tree lighting.
[02:35:46.524 --> 02:35:57.833]  Oh, we've signed the North American SPP security perimeter to use Mexican and Canadian troops to deal with terrorists and troublemakers and the American people.
[02:35:58.773 --> 02:36:06.975]  And I sent the guys to Chicago where they witnessed foreign European troops training to take Americans' guns.
[02:36:07.275 --> 02:36:08.055]  It's on video.
[02:36:08.835 --> 02:36:10.655]  And still Americans are in denial.
[02:36:11.056 --> 02:36:15.877]  Even when I show them AP or Ottawa Citizen or own footage, they go, oh, that's not true.
[02:36:16.317 --> 02:36:17.737]  Your video doesn't show that.
[02:36:17.997 --> 02:36:22.398]  When our guys were there, they were practicing putting them in the football stadium.
[02:36:23.098 --> 02:36:29.843]  Dutch and Czech Republic and Polish troops with the Chicago Police and the National Guard.
[02:36:30.324 --> 02:36:35.588]  They are, and they admit they're training for us, but the public says we're liars, Bob Chapman.
[02:36:36.969 --> 02:36:41.833]  That's right, and they're going to be coming running in our direction when it happens.
[02:36:41.873 --> 02:36:42.453]  What do we do?
[02:36:42.493 --> 02:36:42.954]  What do we do?
[02:36:45.376 --> 02:36:47.057]  Well tell them, lock and load.
[02:36:47.437 --> 02:36:48.658]  That's the best thing you can do.
[02:36:49.399 --> 02:36:50.820]  And by lock and load you mean?
[02:36:50.840 --> 02:36:51.540]  You wouldn't listen.
[02:36:51.700 --> 02:36:57.464]  By lock you mean put yourself in handcuffs and chain those to your ankles and then get in the position?
[02:36:59.465 --> 02:37:11.994]  Well actually it's the use of the N1 Garand and it was a top feeding magazine fed weapon that I used and
[02:37:13.078 --> 02:37:22.448]  What you do is you lock, and then you pull the slide back, and then you drop your magazine in, hoping you don't catch your thumb in there.
[02:37:23.028 --> 02:37:24.770]  So that's called locking Al-Qaeda.
[02:37:25.110 --> 02:37:28.474]  I mean, are you a supporter of the terrorists, George Washington, sir?
[02:37:30.066 --> 02:37:30.667]  Well, of course.
[02:37:31.527 --> 02:37:39.674]  You mean you're the type that wouldn't turn your guns in and offer your wife up for the enjoyment of the foreign troops?
[02:37:40.094 --> 02:37:43.397]  You're somebody that believes in freedom?
[02:37:44.498 --> 02:37:44.938]  That's right.
[02:37:46.439 --> 02:37:47.660]  Whoa!
[02:37:48.361 --> 02:37:49.202]  Whoa!
[02:37:50.263 --> 02:37:54.046]  What type of... This is not land of the free, home of the brave, Mr. Chapman.
[02:37:54.306 --> 02:37:57.729]  This is land of Prozac, of subservience and being conned.
[02:37:58.905 --> 02:38:01.747]  Patriotism is giving up all your freedom and being stupid.
[02:38:02.388 --> 02:38:03.409]  You're a sicko, buddy.
[02:38:03.429 --> 02:38:04.770]  Okay?
[02:38:05.851 --> 02:38:06.891]  You know, it's interesting.
[02:38:07.332 --> 02:38:18.401]  When I was living in Florida, a health food store person that owned the store told me that about 75% of the people over 65 are in something like Prozac.
[02:38:18.421 --> 02:38:19.141]  I couldn't believe it.
[02:38:20.903 --> 02:38:21.923]  Well, those are good people.
[02:38:23.925 --> 02:38:27.268]  You know, Bob, do you not like North Korea?
[02:38:29.261 --> 02:38:30.782]  No, no, I don't like them.
[02:38:30.842 --> 02:38:32.924]  I don't like dictatorships of any kind.
[02:38:35.566 --> 02:38:37.727]  Governments are trying to help the people.
[02:38:37.787 --> 02:38:39.428]  Kim Jong Il works so hard.
[02:38:39.728 --> 02:38:41.650]  You're an anti-government extremist, man.
[02:38:42.891 --> 02:38:43.351]  What next?
[02:38:43.391 --> 02:38:44.652]  You're not going to like Lenin.
[02:38:44.672 --> 02:38:50.136]  Oh, Nikolai and I had nothing in common.
[02:38:50.976 --> 02:38:54.359]  Folks, I want to apologize to listeners right now for having a sicko on.
[02:38:56.271 --> 02:38:56.611]  Do you?
[02:38:56.631 --> 02:38:57.553]  That's okay.
[02:38:57.793 --> 02:39:01.378]  Do you like that criminal, Thomas Jefferson?
[02:39:02.639 --> 02:39:03.200]  Of course.
[02:39:03.220 --> 02:39:05.563]  Absolutely.
[02:39:05.844 --> 02:39:08.668]  I'd go right to the end for Thomas Jefferson.
[02:39:09.048 --> 02:39:11.031]  Hold on just a minute, I gotta call the police here.
[02:39:16.675 --> 02:39:16.955]  Yes.
[02:39:18.777 --> 02:39:19.378]  I'll hold.
[02:39:20.199 --> 02:39:20.660]  Thank you.
[02:39:21.160 --> 02:39:21.801]  Put me right through.
[02:39:22.482 --> 02:39:22.842]  Thank you.
[02:39:23.082 --> 02:39:23.363]  Hold on.
[02:39:23.403 --> 02:39:23.763]  Okay.
[02:39:23.943 --> 02:39:24.384]  Extension.
[02:39:25.665 --> 02:39:25.905]  Hold on.
[02:39:25.945 --> 02:39:27.027]  I'm calling the police department.
[02:39:27.747 --> 02:39:28.408]  Yes, officer.
[02:39:29.790 --> 02:39:30.430]  Yes, officer.
[02:39:32.725 --> 02:39:43.518]  I happen to have gotten on my radio show a guy, and I saw your MIAC and Homeland Security reports, and they said that if somebody has a Ron Paul sticker, or talks about the Founding Fathers, or makes frequent references to the U.S.
[02:39:43.558 --> 02:39:45.760]  Constitution, that I should call you immediately?
[02:39:45.780 --> 02:39:47.322]  They're a homegrown, violent terrorist?
[02:39:47.923 --> 02:39:48.463]  Mm-hmm, yes.
[02:39:49.204 --> 02:39:49.784]  Well, thank you.
[02:39:50.284 --> 02:39:51.725]  Well, I would like a cash prize.
[02:39:51.765 --> 02:39:54.146]  I would like to be part of InfraGard, spying on my neighbors.
[02:39:54.186 --> 02:39:55.486]  That's what freedom's about, right?
[02:39:56.427 --> 02:39:56.907]  Exactly.
[02:39:57.527 --> 02:39:58.027]  Exactly.
[02:39:59.428 --> 02:39:59.848]  Exactly.
[02:39:59.888 --> 02:40:01.229]  Our founding East German fathers.
[02:40:02.189 --> 02:40:02.949]  Thank goodness for them.
[02:40:03.530 --> 02:40:12.293]  So, you're saying, just don't let the terrorists know that I'm aware he's there, give you his whereabouts, and then you'll send a SWAT team in the middle of the night.
[02:40:12.313 --> 02:40:13.073]  That'll show him.
[02:40:13.593 --> 02:40:14.234]  That'll teach him.
[02:40:14.274 --> 02:40:16.635]  That's how the good guys come in black uniforms at 3 a.m.
[02:40:17.115 --> 02:40:17.315]  Uh-huh.
[02:40:18.155 --> 02:40:18.895]  Uh-huh.
[02:40:18.915 --> 02:40:19.395]  Well, good.
[02:40:21.436 --> 02:40:23.896]  Now, so I did the right thing.
[02:40:25.556 --> 02:40:25.797]  Okay.
[02:40:26.717 --> 02:40:28.257]  Well, I mean, he is a really scary guy.
[02:40:28.277 --> 02:40:29.337]  I mean, he's talking about freedom.
[02:40:31.118 --> 02:40:31.518]  Really?
[02:40:32.438 --> 02:40:33.718]  Oh, that's a good government program.
[02:40:33.738 --> 02:40:36.519]  You're talking about castrating all men at birth so they wouldn't have this problem?
[02:40:37.099 --> 02:40:38.719]  Well, that's better than the Ritalin and Prozac.
[02:40:40.479 --> 02:40:40.819]  Good.
[02:40:42.400 --> 02:40:42.640]  Good.
[02:40:42.700 --> 02:40:43.280]  Okay, thank you.
[02:40:44.612 --> 02:40:45.133]  Sorry, Bob.
[02:40:45.173 --> 02:40:47.514]  I had to get that call in as an American patriot.
[02:40:47.714 --> 02:40:48.115]  Go ahead.
[02:40:48.295 --> 02:40:49.015]  Go ahead, scum.
[02:40:51.277 --> 02:40:59.743]  Well, I think that everybody has to look inside themselves to decide whether they want to be a terrorist or not.
[02:41:01.023 --> 02:41:05.306]  And I've chosen to be one in the eyes of the United States government.
[02:41:06.167 --> 02:41:10.990]  And it's one of the reasons I don't live there anymore, because they don't like people like me.
[02:41:11.871 --> 02:41:13.372]  And they threatened me before.
[02:41:14.301 --> 02:41:15.421]  And I believe them.
[02:41:15.841 --> 02:41:17.742]  I used to work for them, actually, at one time.
[02:41:19.742 --> 02:41:21.683]  And, you know, you mentioned the East Germans.
[02:41:22.683 --> 02:41:25.324]  You know, we spend so much time spying on them.
[02:41:26.564 --> 02:41:35.906]  And this man, Marcus Wolf, who's one of the most reprehensible, evil people who's ever lived on the planet... You're not allowed to make moral judgments.
[02:41:35.966 --> 02:41:38.467]  A great patriot of government, helping the people.
[02:41:38.947 --> 02:41:39.887]  Don't you put him down!
[02:41:40.759 --> 02:41:41.399]  Go ahead, sorry.
[02:41:41.419 --> 02:41:45.980]  Well, our government hired him instead of hanging him.
[02:41:46.120 --> 02:41:46.400]  See?
[02:41:46.420 --> 02:41:46.480]  See?
[02:41:47.400 --> 02:41:47.720]  See?
[02:41:47.981 --> 02:41:48.281]  See?
[02:41:48.441 --> 02:41:48.901]  He's good.
[02:41:49.061 --> 02:41:49.541]  You're bad.
[02:41:53.142 --> 02:42:04.364]  I've had a very interesting life among those things and your commentary is excellent because it makes people understand
[02:42:05.524 --> 02:42:08.747]  What the government is up to and what their thought process is.
[02:42:08.947 --> 02:42:14.431]  They're helping people 11 years ago when they signed the secret deal to take all death benefits of troops.
[02:42:14.771 --> 02:42:19.695]  What are you saying it's wrong when troops have paid into death benefits their whole life and they die and their widow gets the money?
[02:42:19.955 --> 02:42:26.260]  You're saying that wasn't a classy, cool, good thing of Prudential and other insurance companies to do in a secret deal with the government?
[02:42:26.501 --> 02:42:27.421]  Bloomberg AP?
[02:42:27.842 --> 02:42:29.343]  Are you saying that wasn't good?
[02:42:30.564 --> 02:42:31.204]  You're filth!
[02:42:31.224 --> 02:42:31.965]  It was not good.
[02:42:32.005 --> 02:42:32.745]  It was terrible.
[02:42:33.466 --> 02:42:34.026]  And you know, um,
[02:42:35.427 --> 02:42:42.540]  For those of you who don't know, there were seven major insurance companies that received TARP funds as well.
[02:42:42.640 --> 02:42:43.221]  They're good people.
[02:42:43.241 --> 02:42:44.864]  So they can gamble in the stock market.
[02:42:44.964 --> 02:42:45.665]  They're good people.
[02:42:47.028 --> 02:42:47.829]  Unbelievable.
[02:42:47.969 --> 02:42:48.490]  No, you're bad.
[02:42:49.793 --> 02:42:54.196]  And you know, I'm going to go to Walmart today, and when I'm on the telescreen, it says, Report Suspicious People.
[02:42:54.756 --> 02:42:59.539]  I have a Homeland Security new manual they're putting out in Oklahoma, saying if people talk about politics, call the police.
[02:43:00.160 --> 02:43:01.420]  I'm going to call on you, buddy.
[02:43:01.741 --> 02:43:02.501]  I've got power.
[02:43:02.521 --> 02:43:05.623]  I know how to call people in black uniforms and report you.
[02:43:05.843 --> 02:43:08.005]  I'm a real American, not like you.
[02:43:11.987 --> 02:43:12.507]  Please don't.
[02:43:12.667 --> 02:43:13.008]  Please.
[02:43:13.548 --> 02:43:14.329]  They might get me.
[02:43:16.090 --> 02:43:18.111]  We're going to crush the enemy, aren't we, Chapman?
[02:43:19.372 --> 02:43:20.573]  You bet your life we are.
[02:43:20.733 --> 02:43:21.173]  I can feel it.
[02:43:21.193 --> 02:43:30.000]  They're kicking the crap out of them right now, on radio and through the internet, and they are running around in circles, they're expediting their program.
[02:43:30.880 --> 02:43:31.260]  I'm sorry.
[02:43:31.461 --> 02:43:40.067]  And they're in trouble, and they know it, and we have their names, addresses, phone numbers, and when this thing breaks open, they got a problem.
[02:43:41.147 --> 02:43:47.652]  And all the King's horses and all the King's Homeland Security men aren't gonna keep the big fat Humpty Dumpties together.
[02:43:49.011 --> 02:43:49.632]  That's right.
[02:43:50.173 --> 02:43:51.054]  They've gone too far.
[02:43:51.214 --> 02:43:53.237]  Again, this is not the first time they've done this.
[02:43:54.318 --> 02:43:54.899]  But they don't care.
[02:43:54.939 --> 02:43:58.824]  That's the risk they're willing to take to subjugate the people of the world.
[02:43:59.745 --> 02:44:04.632]  And there's lots of very, very bright people out there who know what they're doing.
[02:44:05.293 --> 02:44:10.658]  Who are telling people who don't realize what they're doing, what they're doing, and what you can do about it.
[02:44:10.998 --> 02:44:12.479]  Or at least get prepared for it.
[02:44:12.499 --> 02:44:21.547]  Alright, I want to go back to... Bob, I want to go to some calls while we've got you, but I did want to... I was going to do these sarcastically and go, how dare you, Chapman, you don't like this?
[02:44:21.567 --> 02:44:23.669]  In fact, let me just go back into character and do it.
[02:44:24.250 --> 02:44:26.572]  How dare you, you American pig?
[02:44:26.592 --> 02:44:29.634]  And you can call me Newell or Trash if you want, Bob.
[02:44:29.694 --> 02:44:31.976]  This is all just to illustrate absurdity for folks.
[02:44:32.957 --> 02:44:34.739]  Here's the NBC News.
[02:44:35.259 --> 02:44:38.621]  Alcohol detectors could be standard with all new cars.
[02:44:39.202 --> 02:44:45.086]  And they've also announced they want standard police cameras where they can dial in and watch you whenever they want.
[02:44:45.386 --> 02:44:46.807]  Now that's BBC.
[02:44:47.228 --> 02:44:47.848]  Freedom!
[02:44:48.228 --> 02:44:48.909]  That's freedom!
[02:44:49.369 --> 02:44:49.970]  Here's another one.
[02:44:50.170 --> 02:44:55.854]  LAPD seizes antique weapon and bullets from Charlie Sheen's home because of the restraining order.
[02:44:55.894 --> 02:44:56.674]  Turns out they've already...
[02:44:57.615 --> 02:45:04.941]  Stop the restraining order, but it was an old, antique, spiked Sharps rifle, a movie replica.
[02:45:05.421 --> 02:45:06.022]  But they don't care.
[02:45:06.042 --> 02:45:08.063]  An excuse to ransack his house looking for drugs.
[02:45:08.123 --> 02:45:08.884]  No drugs were found.
[02:45:09.404 --> 02:45:10.385]  Another police state issue.
[02:45:10.705 --> 02:45:12.807]  Rand Paul says, hands off my toilet.
[02:45:13.127 --> 02:45:15.669]  Federal government trying to control the toilet size, setting the precedent.
[02:45:17.731 --> 02:45:21.154]  Congress is moving to investigate Google being an NSA front.
[02:45:21.614 --> 02:45:23.836]  That's the National Journal, so some good news there.
[02:45:24.937 --> 02:45:26.338]  What do you think about that, Bob Chapman?
[02:45:28.977 --> 02:45:30.117]  Same-o, same-o.
[02:45:30.757 --> 02:45:43.241]  And you know, just thinking about the visit with Charlie, and I'm not going to go into the names and details, but there was a beautiful piece of property in Malibu.
[02:45:43.261 --> 02:45:44.281]  I lived there for a long time.
[02:45:45.281 --> 02:45:47.662]  And a gentleman and his wife lived there.
[02:45:47.682 --> 02:45:51.943]  And the government decided they wanted that piece of land.
[02:45:53.383 --> 02:45:54.924]  And they tried to put
[02:45:57.086 --> 02:45:59.888]  Marijuana plants on this property didn't work out too well.
[02:45:59.908 --> 02:46:01.430]  So they just walked up and shot him in the back?
[02:46:01.470 --> 02:46:02.290]  That's a famous story.
[02:46:03.331 --> 02:46:03.791]  That's right.
[02:46:04.532 --> 02:46:05.132]  And I knew him.
[02:46:06.173 --> 02:46:08.055]  And not very well, but I knew him.
[02:46:08.115 --> 02:46:09.696]  I had met him through other people.
[02:46:09.736 --> 02:46:15.200]  And you know, when you're involved in coaching for a long, long time in the city, you know everybody and they know their kids.
[02:46:16.441 --> 02:46:17.522]  But anyway, they murdered him.
[02:46:19.364 --> 02:46:24.968]  And it's not too far from where I lived and Charlie and Martin live and so on.
[02:46:26.011 --> 02:46:27.571]  And that's the kind of police state we live in.
[02:46:27.591 --> 02:46:28.892]  This has been going on for years.
[02:46:31.052 --> 02:46:36.253]  By the way, the police memos, that case made national news, came out where they were planning to kill him and get the property.
[02:46:36.273 --> 02:46:44.934]  Because that wasn't something like 80 acres or something, it was worth hundreds of millions, but he just wanted to keep it, and they kept saying sell it, and then the cops even tried to get the money themselves.
[02:46:45.515 --> 02:46:47.035]  But see, he deserved to die.
[02:46:47.075 --> 02:46:48.295]  You shouldn't own private property.
[02:46:48.315 --> 02:46:49.995]  That's right.
[02:46:50.255 --> 02:46:50.956]  He's like me.
[02:46:51.596 --> 02:46:52.956]  I deserve to die because
[02:46:53.843 --> 02:46:54.583]  I'm a terrorist!
[02:46:55.183 --> 02:46:56.424]  Yep, I'm glad you admit it.
[02:46:58.325 --> 02:46:59.685]  And I'm very proud to admit it.
[02:46:59.705 --> 02:47:01.526]  And all the babies deserve to be aborted, too.
[02:47:01.966 --> 02:47:02.886]  It's a Christian.
[02:47:04.687 --> 02:47:06.007]  Well, I disagree with that, too.
[02:47:06.027 --> 02:47:09.748]  Well, I'm being sarcastic, Bob, but let's be modern Americans.
[02:47:11.449 --> 02:47:13.009]  Well, I'm not very modern.
[02:47:13.850 --> 02:47:14.330]  I guess I'm
[02:47:15.525 --> 02:47:16.686]  Uh, what would you call it?
[02:47:16.966 --> 02:47:18.626]  A, uh... A throwback.
[02:47:18.646 --> 02:47:19.366]  A throwback.
[02:47:19.687 --> 02:47:20.507]  A throwback.
[02:47:21.327 --> 02:47:23.808]  Sort of, uh, Pythocanthropus erectus.
[02:47:23.828 --> 02:47:27.489]  Or, uh... Or the, uh... Cro-Magnon!
[02:47:27.729 --> 02:47:30.630]  Or the, uh... Well, a little bit beyond that.
[02:47:30.690 --> 02:47:32.931]  A typical 12th century man.
[02:47:34.269 --> 02:47:37.732]  So you're a, you're a, well, I kind of see myself as a Stone Age man.
[02:47:37.752 --> 02:47:44.877]  Of course, that would be 10,000 years ago, before the dawn of the Bronze Age, 9,000, and the Iberian Maxim.
[02:47:46.398 --> 02:47:48.319]  Let's talk to Josh in New York.
[02:47:48.339 --> 02:47:48.960]  You're on the air.
[02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:49.840]  Go ahead, Josh.
[02:47:50.461 --> 02:47:51.021]  What's going on?
[02:47:51.601 --> 02:47:54.243]  Worldwide transmission with a terrorist named Bob Chapman.
[02:47:54.263 --> 02:47:55.784]  You're hilarious.
[02:47:56.465 --> 02:48:00.488]  Listen, now, I truly believe this is a government controlled event today.
[02:48:01.212 --> 02:48:02.955]  I might be way off base here with this.
[02:48:03.075 --> 02:48:05.218]  Well, the Pentagon admits they have tectonic weapons.
[02:48:05.298 --> 02:48:05.799]  Army Times, 1997.
[02:48:05.899 --> 02:48:07.982]  In fact, we never looked that up.
[02:48:08.002 --> 02:48:08.743]  I think it was April 1997.
[02:48:08.783 --> 02:48:11.487]  Secretary of Defense Cohen.
[02:48:11.788 --> 02:48:14.392]  I'm sorry, so you think, you're harping on harp.
[02:48:14.412 --> 02:48:15.093]  What do you think happened?
[02:48:16.033 --> 02:48:17.934]  I think there was bombs under the ocean.
[02:48:18.014 --> 02:48:19.495]  I think the government did this whole thing.
[02:48:19.835 --> 02:48:34.524]  Well, there is the tsunami bomb that at the end of World War II, that's the times of Australia, they were thinking about detonating a tsunami bomb, an A-bomb off the coast of Japan, but they decided just to go ahead and drop them on them.
[02:48:34.944 --> 02:48:37.085]  So it is true they have a tsunami bomb program.
[02:48:37.705 --> 02:48:39.086]  Bob Chapman, any comments on that?
[02:48:40.447 --> 02:48:41.107]  No, not really.
[02:48:43.371 --> 02:48:53.759]  I grew up during that era, but other than the fact that they hit those two cities, my mind doesn't work in those channels.
[02:48:53.779 --> 02:48:57.061]  Wait a minute, if you criticize dropping A-bombs on Japan, it didn't happen.
[02:48:57.381 --> 02:49:00.063]  If you support the dropping of the bombs, it happened and you're a patriot.
[02:49:02.105 --> 02:49:06.708]  I think it was necessary because they didn't want to lose any more people.
[02:49:07.475 --> 02:49:10.176]  Yeah, well then the attack existed then.
[02:49:10.736 --> 02:49:12.197]  It would be a conspiracy theory.
[02:49:12.217 --> 02:49:14.017]  There was no atomic attack if you're against it.
[02:49:14.677 --> 02:49:16.138]  Thank you, Josh.
[02:49:16.618 --> 02:49:17.718]  We're now globalists here on the show.
[02:49:18.279 --> 02:49:20.299]  Let's go ahead and talk to Steve in Florida.
[02:49:20.599 --> 02:49:22.600]  And if you don't like Florida, it doesn't exist.
[02:49:22.720 --> 02:49:23.981]  If you like it, it does exist.
[02:49:24.641 --> 02:49:25.481]  Steven, you're on the air.
[02:49:25.501 --> 02:49:25.861]  Go ahead.
[02:49:27.002 --> 02:49:33.884]  Yeah, first of all, I wanted to say I'm very glad to be affiliated with Al-Qaeda Jones and Robert Barron Chapman.
[02:49:35.624 --> 02:49:36.745]  In good company with them.
[02:49:37.270 --> 02:49:50.142]  Hey Alex, I wanted to give you a heads up, you may or may not be aware of this, but of course you know, you've been talking about the situation in Japan and the potential deadliness that's there because of the nuclear reactors.
[02:49:51.283 --> 02:49:56.848]  I was watching a video presentation this guy put out on the internet, I can't remember his name, but
[02:49:57.409 --> 02:50:07.618]  He was talking about how FEMA, and he showed the documentation from their own website, they have an emergency preparedness exercise planned in May.
[02:50:07.838 --> 02:50:14.284]  Yeah, in the Mississippi area, by the corners of Arkansas and Kansas?
[02:50:15.120 --> 02:50:19.042]  Yeah, the New Madrid Fault Line area where there's a huge nuclear reactor.
[02:50:19.062 --> 02:50:24.946]  Well, you know the Mississippi River's changed course a couple times just since the Louisiana Purchase because of earthquakes.
[02:50:25.346 --> 02:50:27.968]  There is a big fault line there and they are doing a drill up there.
[02:50:28.348 --> 02:50:32.531]  And so, but, I mean, they did a drill of Building 7 being attacked on 9-11.
[02:50:32.991 --> 02:50:38.575]  They did drills of the 7-7 attacks at the exact same time, exact same place on the subways and bus.
[02:50:39.215 --> 02:50:42.097]  They did a drill of attacking Oklahoma City right before it happened?
[02:50:42.437 --> 02:50:45.079]  That's just a coincidence if there's an earthquake, sir.
[02:50:45.760 --> 02:50:47.321]  Okay, I appreciate your call.
[02:50:48.201 --> 02:50:49.402]  You are with Al Qaeda.
[02:50:50.123 --> 02:50:51.464]  Thinking is with Al Qaeda.
[02:50:52.144 --> 02:50:53.605]  The family is Al Qaeda.
[02:50:54.106 --> 02:50:55.247]  Love is Al Qaeda.
[02:50:55.627 --> 02:50:56.668]  Truth is Al Qaeda.
[02:50:57.188 --> 02:50:58.529]  Love is America.
[02:50:59.927 --> 02:51:06.212]  Imagine being free of debt in just 12 weeks without payment plans or negotiating or hiring an attorney.

[02:51:16.900 --> 02:51:18.401]  My wages were being garnished.

[02:52:29.165 --> 02:52:30.227]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:52:30.407 --> 02:52:34.793]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:52:34.973 --> 02:52:40.701]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:52:40.801 --> 02:52:44.166]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:52:44.426 --> 02:52:47.308]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:52:49.289 --> 02:52:52.051]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:52:52.191 --> 02:52:52.431]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:52:52.451 --> 02:52:53.371]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:52:53.391 --> 02:52:54.792]  The collapse of the dollar is imminent.
[02:53:01.596 --> 02:53:12.322]  You can protect your wealth by buying gold, silver, and strong foreign currencies, but what if the government confiscates your precious metals, implements exchange controls, or nationalizes your retirement?
[02:53:12.482 --> 02:53:13.683]  You need a backup plan.
[02:53:13.763 --> 02:53:17.605]  That's why you must move your wealth into an offshore asset protection structure.
[02:53:17.765 --> 02:53:30.392]  Go to CollapsedRoof.com to get your free special report and discover how to store your gold and silver in the world's safest vaults, or how to hold foreign currencies in a way that's safe from bank failures, bank runs, or exchange controls.

[02:53:31.333 --> 02:53:37.837]  government failed to collect a $36 million claim because the defendant legally used an offshore asset protection program.
[02:53:37.918 --> 02:53:43.342]  This is what you need to keep your wealth safe when the dollar collapses, and CollapseProof.com can help.

[02:53:49.206 --> 02:53:49.406]  That's 800-798-2008.
[02:53:49.426 --> 02:53:50.027]  CollapseProof.com.
[02:53:50.047 --> 02:53:51.808]  Asset protection in financially unsafe times.
[02:54:00.501 --> 02:54:05.645]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:06.325 --> 02:54:08.607]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:54:09.888 --> 02:54:18.334]  If the developments go too crazy or there's a meltdown at a Chernobyl event, I will be on air.
[02:54:19.397 --> 02:54:24.360]  I gotta call my wife, because it'll just take a couple days if it doesn't melt down for the radiation to get here.
[02:54:24.741 --> 02:54:27.383]  Our news will tell us everything's fine, even as detectors are going off.
[02:54:27.763 --> 02:54:29.524]  I gotta get my kids on potassium iodate.
[02:54:30.825 --> 02:54:32.766]  But hopefully it's not gonna melt down.
[02:54:33.287 --> 02:54:40.392]  A few hours ago they were talking about opening up the reactor to let off the heat, because they can't get coolant through it.
[02:54:41.263 --> 02:54:44.864]  And it's a big one of six in a nest of them.
[02:54:45.304 --> 02:54:49.044]  Now, the government has said they are now releasing radioactive vapor.
[02:54:49.685 --> 02:54:53.025]  But that's nothing compared to a meltdown.
[02:54:54.005 --> 02:54:54.825]  That's all they can do.
[02:54:55.406 --> 02:54:57.066]  That's the danger of nuclear.
[02:54:59.826 --> 02:55:00.386]  Unbelievable.
[02:55:00.586 --> 02:55:05.787]  So, Japan to release radioactive vapor in a nuke plant, and it goes on to say they're now doing it.
[02:55:07.128 --> 02:55:09.028]  So they've gone from saying they might to they are.
[02:55:10.526 --> 02:55:12.093]  I'll be back Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:55:12.153 --> 02:55:12.515]  Central.
[02:55:12.816 --> 02:55:15.568]  I'm gonna go into overdrive a little bit in the next hour so we can get to, um...
[02:55:16.920 --> 02:55:17.240]  It could.
[02:55:17.260 --> 02:55:20.461]  And I hope that they're telling everybody
[02:55:47.802 --> 02:55:50.685]  To get out of town and get out fast if they can.
[02:55:50.745 --> 02:55:52.187]  Start walking if you have to.
[02:55:52.207 --> 02:55:58.334]  I think they have about a 30 mile radius that they fall out.
[02:55:59.075 --> 02:56:05.062]  If the thing goes, the fallout can visit upon people.
[02:56:06.278 --> 02:56:08.280]  Is that figure correct, do you think, 30 miles?
[02:56:08.620 --> 02:56:20.068]  Well, yeah, if you drop an A-bomb on somebody and there's not high winds, but when it melts down it goes into the other isotopes and other metals and creates really radioactive groupings and then it can go into the jet stream.
[02:56:20.108 --> 02:56:23.391]  Chernobyl was like a thousand mile plus plume of
[02:56:24.131 --> 02:56:27.892]  of land that's still contaminated, thousands and thousands dead connected to it.
[02:56:28.852 --> 02:56:30.192]  So this thing will go worldwide.
[02:56:30.232 --> 02:56:38.214]  But yeah, the epicenter, you know, generally, depending on the winds, you know, would be 30 to 50 miles depending on how they're blowing.
[02:56:38.774 --> 02:56:40.334]  But it's a dose everybody's going to get.
[02:56:41.114 --> 02:56:42.094]  Hopefully it isn't going to happen.
[02:56:42.114 --> 02:56:43.214]  Everybody should be praying right now.
[02:56:43.635 --> 02:56:46.935]  Jordan in Canada, you're on the air with a terrorist, Bob Chapman.
[02:56:48.255 --> 02:56:50.516]  Yeah, I just have a quick couple questions here.
[02:56:52.461 --> 02:56:58.903]  Uh, one is dealing with, uh, the New World Order and how we're being, uh, led to these FEMA camps.
[02:56:59.124 --> 02:57:01.684]  You mean our saviors, the good people that aren't the terrorists?
[02:57:02.105 --> 02:57:02.345]  Yes.
[02:57:02.405 --> 02:57:03.645]  Are you talking bad about government?
[02:57:03.685 --> 02:57:06.086]  Okay, well they, they're what makes the grass grow.
[02:57:07.407 --> 02:57:08.287]  Okay, so, um...
[02:57:08.928 --> 02:57:13.694]  Now, TV, they don't call TV shows programming for nothing.
[02:57:14.135 --> 02:57:19.521]  Now, I've been noticing a lot of alien movies coming out, dealing with aliens and stuff like that.
[02:57:19.942 --> 02:57:25.189]  Now, do you think the government is desensitizing the general public to the thought?
[02:57:25.882 --> 02:57:27.683]  Well, a lot of it's entertainment, too.
[02:57:28.003 --> 02:57:28.624]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:57:28.664 --> 02:57:31.766]  I mean, they don't even need to have the overall message in a film.
[02:57:31.846 --> 02:57:37.990]  Now, with the flicker rates, they can manipulate the metabolic rate of the brain itself, separate from the overall message.
[02:57:38.431 --> 02:57:43.754]  But there is admitted government programs, Project Bluebeam and others, to do fake alien landings.
[02:57:44.074 --> 02:57:45.015]  I appreciate your call.
[02:57:45.335 --> 02:57:46.556]  Comment on that, Bob Chapman.
[02:57:48.598 --> 02:57:49.218]  I have none.
[02:57:50.319 --> 02:57:53.561]  It's beyond my abilities to answer that.
[02:57:53.601 --> 02:57:54.782]  That's because you're a terrorist.
[02:57:55.876 --> 02:57:56.276]  Of course.
[02:57:56.916 --> 02:57:59.437]  What, now you're being racist towards the gray aliens?
[02:58:00.837 --> 02:58:02.257]  No, no, no.
[02:58:02.377 --> 02:58:06.118]  I've just never encountered any and I wouldn't really know where there are any.
[02:58:06.258 --> 02:58:07.838]  Not having a comment is racist.
[02:58:09.338 --> 02:58:10.278]  Okay.
[02:58:10.379 --> 02:58:11.099]  I'll accept that.
[02:58:11.259 --> 02:58:12.419]  Are you a plant-a-phobe?
[02:58:13.739 --> 02:58:15.379]  What do you call being scared of aliens?
[02:58:15.459 --> 02:58:19.860]  It is xenophobe if you don't like a particular group of people, say, that want to kill you.
[02:58:20.440 --> 02:58:22.221]  So what's not liking the aliens?
[02:58:23.141 --> 02:58:24.381]  Are you an alien denier?
[02:58:26.912 --> 02:58:28.333]  How do you know I might be an alien?
[02:58:29.154 --> 02:58:30.315]  Maybe you should be arrested.
[02:58:30.836 --> 02:58:32.737]  Maybe you're denying that the aliens exist.
[02:58:33.098 --> 02:58:35.840]  Maybe that's code for racism.
[02:58:35.860 --> 02:58:38.122]  There's no end to the sickening things you do, Bob.
[02:58:42.066 --> 02:58:43.947]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:45.489 --> 02:58:47.751]  Visit GCNlive.com today.

[02:59:02.847 --> 02:59:07.671]  Not looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[02:59:08.431 --> 02:59:11.934]  Not worried about them moving south.
[02:59:12.094 --> 02:59:15.497]  Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[02:59:18.215 --> 02:59:22.558]  I'm looking for America.
[02:59:23.738 --> 02:59:25.159]  We're American and be proud.

[02:59:50.417 --> 02:59:51.579]  Coast to Coast.
[02:59:51.960 --> 02:59:53.262]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:54.003 --> 02:59:57.208]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:09.904 --> 03:00:13.185]  Bob Chapman, an America hater.
[03:00:13.205 --> 03:00:15.226]  He hates tyranny.
[03:00:15.446 --> 03:00:16.266]  He's an America hater.
[03:00:16.727 --> 03:00:19.267]  He's racist towards aliens from the planet Wiggle Bob.
[03:00:19.287 --> 03:00:23.169]  He doesn't like Nazis either.
[03:00:23.389 --> 03:00:23.749]  Racist.
[03:00:23.769 --> 03:00:25.250]  He's not allowed to have a political view.
[03:00:26.130 --> 03:00:27.511]  Probably doesn't like the Aztecs either.
[03:00:27.591 --> 03:00:27.951]  Racist.
[03:00:28.231 --> 03:00:29.431]  Doesn't like child sacrifice.
[03:00:29.451 --> 03:00:34.033]  All right, I'm going to stop being sarcastic here, but I'm illustrating absurdity by being absurd.
[03:00:34.553 --> 03:00:37.334]  Richard in Vermont, probably a terrorist as well.
[03:00:38.094 --> 03:00:38.735]  You're on the air.
[03:00:38.775 --> 03:00:39.315]  Go ahead, sir.
[03:00:40.478 --> 03:00:41.739]  Yeah, how are you doing, Alex?
[03:00:42.999 --> 03:00:43.459]  And Bob.
[03:00:43.940 --> 03:00:46.841]  Yeah, I'm definitely a terrorist.
[03:00:47.621 --> 03:00:56.606]  I actually withdrew all my money out of the bank yesterday and I told them to start sending my unemployment checks to my house and stop taking taxes out of them because I'm getting nailed so much.
[03:00:57.226 --> 03:00:59.267]  So you're fed up, you're standing up, well.
[03:01:01.108 --> 03:01:02.949]  Yeah, I mean, you can only throw up so much.
[03:01:02.969 --> 03:01:06.290]  Well, you're like the Founding Fathers, an actual real man putting it all on the line.
[03:01:06.550 --> 03:01:07.671]  How un-American, sorry.
[03:01:08.690 --> 03:01:29.344]  Yeah, I wanted to mention I was looking at a video that they had on MSNBC and they showed all of the tsunami is starting to affect the west coast down in the Monterey Bay area and what was happening was all the boats that were moored there were starting to come
[03:01:30.145 --> 03:01:32.769]  Oh, it looked like they were moving out to sea.
[03:01:33.431 --> 03:01:35.634]  Yeah, that happens generally.
[03:01:35.675 --> 03:01:36.416]  There's different types.
[03:01:36.456 --> 03:01:40.122]  But yeah, they get sucked out first before the wave comes back in.
[03:01:41.425 --> 03:01:51.188]  What I wanted to do was remind everybody that I remember the Indonesian tsunami.
[03:01:51.208 --> 03:02:03.352]  They had a bunch of kids that were playing on the beach and when the water receded so far back there were fish flopping around on the sand because the kids ran out to play with the fish.
[03:02:03.392 --> 03:02:07.334]  There could be a big tsunami in the next few hours headed out there.
[03:02:08.832 --> 03:02:19.981]  Well what happens is these kids went out there and they were playing because the tide receded so quickly because the energy of the tsunami sucks the water out before it actually comes back in and pulls forth.
[03:02:20.861 --> 03:02:31.730]  And I'm just saying if anybody is out there on the west coast and you got kids playing on the beach and they think that'd be fun to go grab onto a couple of fish and stuff like that, stay the hell out of the way because when the water comes back in
[03:02:32.710 --> 03:02:33.911]  You can kiss your kids goodbye.
[03:02:33.931 --> 03:02:36.312]  I watched these kids get floated away on that wave.
[03:02:36.692 --> 03:02:37.933]  I've seen the footage as well.
[03:02:38.313 --> 03:02:39.653]  God bless you, Richard.
[03:02:39.694 --> 03:02:40.214]  Great points.
[03:02:40.254 --> 03:02:45.356]  And to be sarcastic again, how dare him as a citizen have his own view and try to warn people?
[03:02:45.616 --> 03:02:47.957]  There's government announcements to warn people.
[03:02:48.377 --> 03:02:52.119]  You're not supposed to out there be calling into shows trying to warn people.
[03:02:52.499 --> 03:02:55.641]  That's kind of vigilante, isn't it, Bob Chapman?
[03:02:56.508 --> 03:02:57.288]  It certainly is.
[03:02:57.308 --> 03:02:58.849]  It certainly is.
[03:02:59.149 --> 03:03:00.169]  Very shameful, Richard.
[03:03:00.849 --> 03:03:03.170]  John in California, probably another evil person.
[03:03:03.530 --> 03:03:04.790]  John, you even know how to talk!
[03:03:05.190 --> 03:03:06.091]  That's against the law.
[03:03:07.331 --> 03:03:11.892]  Yeah, and I also listen to the Bill of Rights every night before I go to bed, so I'm definitely a terrorist.
[03:03:12.312 --> 03:03:13.733]  That's like satanic verses.
[03:03:14.493 --> 03:03:14.753]  Sorry.
[03:03:14.773 --> 03:03:18.634]  Alex, I've been waking up in the last three weeks, and it's all because of you.
[03:03:18.714 --> 03:03:21.935]  You're an invaluable resource to America and humanity.
[03:03:21.975 --> 03:03:23.415]  Just keep doing what you're doing.
[03:03:23.435 --> 03:03:24.796]  Alright, two things.
[03:03:24.916 --> 03:03:25.736]  Abiotic oil.
[03:03:27.583 --> 03:03:31.945]  I heard Lindsey talk a little bit about sweet fruit in the Bakken oil field.
[03:03:40.200 --> 03:03:42.501]  No.
[03:03:42.741 --> 03:03:46.222]  Listen, when you drill in those areas, you may hit oil in eight or nine areas.
[03:03:46.602 --> 03:03:47.683]  There's shale.
[03:03:48.243 --> 03:03:50.423]  There's stuff down 15,000 feet.
[03:03:50.824 --> 03:03:53.845]  There's multi-levels in deep drilling.
[03:03:53.945 --> 03:03:55.105]  They hit natural gas.
[03:03:55.145 --> 03:03:56.225]  They hit oil deposits.
[03:03:56.585 --> 03:04:00.287]  It depends on what they think the biggest load is that they're going for.
[03:04:00.327 --> 03:04:03.968]  Bob Chapman, you want to end the show explaining that to John?
[03:04:05.782 --> 03:04:15.064]  Well, I think you've overviewed it quickly and correctly, and it's wherever they think they'll get the biggest payoff.
[03:04:16.425 --> 03:04:26.307]  I understand from subscribers that there's a lot of activity in North Dakota right now, and they're building tanks.
[03:04:27.399 --> 03:04:29.320]  Uh, you know, for usage, for holding.
[03:04:30.201 --> 03:04:34.804]  And, um, and, uh, Halliburton and others are all over the place.
[03:04:34.884 --> 03:04:36.425]  Oh, yeah, exactly what Lindsey Williams is saying.
[03:04:36.465 --> 03:04:41.628]  Now, you've got people that actually read the International Forecaster.
[03:04:42.248 --> 03:04:42.949]  That's terrorist.
[03:04:42.969 --> 03:04:44.010]  They actually know how to read.

[03:04:48.451 --> 03:04:49.911]  Most Americans have almost gotten there.
