[00:00:05.695 --> 00:00:06.335]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.996 --> 00:00:08.037]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.778 --> 00:00:09.899]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:11.340]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.121 --> 00:00:13.022]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.662 --> 00:00:17.286]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:21.930]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:31.490]  Gentlemen, coming to you by telephone.
[00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:32.471]  Apologize for that.
[00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:34.332]  The Skype does not work everywhere.
[00:00:34.572 --> 00:00:37.013]  The modern miracles of technology are not everywhere.
[00:00:37.394 --> 00:00:43.317]  But I am making my way back to Austin, Texas, and will be in studio very, very soon.
[00:00:43.878 --> 00:00:47.300]  It, of course, is the 22nd day of November 2011.
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:53.664]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours at least.
[00:00:54.384 --> 00:01:02.048]  We've got Greg Pallas joining us in the second hour today, former federal white-collar crime investigator.
[00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:06.251]  I want to get his take on the whole MF Global situation.
[00:01:06.291 --> 00:01:11.414]  He was talking about these brokerage firms about to go completely melly up just two weeks ago with us on air.
[00:01:11.754 --> 00:01:13.575]  So I thought, why not get him back up now?
[00:01:13.975 --> 00:01:20.519]  And then the reason I've been hammering this MF Global situation so much is because it ties into everything.
[00:01:22.024 --> 00:01:25.545]  I'll guarantee you, back in the 1980s, somebody came up and missed him with $100 million.
[00:01:26.385 --> 00:01:27.385]  I don't care who they were.
[00:01:27.845 --> 00:01:31.166]  If they got caught publicly taking it, they were going to at least get a few years in jail.
[00:01:32.126 --> 00:01:35.487]  Like the Keating Five that McCain was involved in.
[00:01:36.187 --> 00:01:41.988]  Now, nothing happens, and they're doing things that make the Keating Five look like angels.
[00:01:42.489 --> 00:01:43.949]  Like choir boys.
[00:01:45.416 --> 00:01:46.656]  Like the Salvation Army.
[00:01:47.997 --> 00:01:49.037]  It is so incredible.
[00:01:49.437 --> 00:01:51.497]  By the way, it's finally really starting to get out there.
[00:01:51.517 --> 00:01:56.759]  The New York Times has the headline, MF Global Trustees to Shortfall Could Exceed $1.2 Billion.
[00:01:57.199 --> 00:02:00.939]  As we reported yesterday, the New York Times is now being forced to kind of get into this.
[00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:03.660]  And Drudge has the top headline.
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.601]  DrudgeReport.com has the gigantic headline.
[00:02:07.621 --> 00:02:09.281]  Let me just scroll down to it.
[00:02:09.961 --> 00:02:12.302]  Where's the Cash Corzine?
[00:02:13.177 --> 00:02:15.519]  Where's the cash, Corzine?
[00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:23.304]  Because now there's just, for two weeks, the mainstream media's been like, well, 600, 700, a million, 1.2, okay, it's more than that.
[00:02:23.624 --> 00:02:24.625]  Just don't worry about it.
[00:02:24.885 --> 00:02:25.686]  It's not a big deal.
[00:02:25.706 --> 00:02:27.987]  We're going to be discussing that today.
[00:02:28.007 --> 00:02:40.556]  Also, if you go to the Drudge Report or InfoWars.com, you can see our headline from InfoWars.com, Paul Joseph Watson article that was up about 4 a.m.
[00:02:40.596 --> 00:02:42.518]  this morning, Secret Police
[00:02:43.718 --> 00:02:55.074]  When they're mowing down the Egyptians that don't want to live under the new oppressive regime that makes Hosni Mubarak look tame.
[00:02:56.553 --> 00:03:00.036]  Well, you get mowed down, and you're not allowed to criticize the government, even mildly.
[00:03:00.056 --> 00:03:00.737]  You get arrested.
[00:03:00.857 --> 00:03:20.176]  And in our loving criminal banker government, our occupational government, that has now become the example of tyranny worldwide, the Communist Chinese say, hey, look what America does to corrupt people running the military junta under globalist control over in Egypt, says, hey, we're just
[00:03:20.196 --> 00:03:20.576]  We're good to go.
[00:03:37.279 --> 00:03:40.741]  So, Secret Police renames itself Homeland Security.
[00:03:40.761 --> 00:03:45.002]  We're going to talk about that first with Paul Watson coming up for one segment.
[00:03:45.283 --> 00:03:47.604]  Then Aaron Dykes is going to give us headlines at the bottom of the hour.
[00:03:48.004 --> 00:03:52.005]  Then Greg Palast will continue then with your calls with Greg Palast.
[00:03:52.486 --> 00:04:01.790]  I want to get to some calls and also in the third hour, when Aaron Dykes runs shotgun, rides shotgun with me today.
[00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.211]  Again, Alex Jones joining you.
[00:04:05.865 --> 00:04:08.567]  November 22, 2011 on this Tuesday edition.
[00:04:09.167 --> 00:04:12.069]  Obviously because it pertains to the overall First Amendment.
[00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:26.159]  I will also discuss later in the hour the New York Times and a whole bunch of other publications coming out and saying, oh, we're talking to one of the White House, the alleged White House shooters friends.
[00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:27.780]  And he says about a year ago,
[00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:32.341]  He watched the Obama Deception with some friends at a party.
[00:04:32.941 --> 00:04:39.725]  And so it's the anti-government, conspiracy-oid, weirdo Alex Jones' fault, basically.
[00:04:41.166 --> 00:04:42.807]  So a very, very dangerous precedent.
[00:04:42.827 --> 00:04:52.673]  And now we see a lot of people spamming one of the Obama Deception uploads with 9.5 million views on YouTube, trying to get it basically taken down.
[00:04:52.713 --> 00:04:55.375]  We'll discuss how this ties into the overall attack on free speech.
[00:04:55.395 --> 00:04:55.775]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:06.660]  Hey folks, this is Crazy Melvin for eFoods Direct and I'm slashing prices to get you the best deals on your food supply!
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:16.702]  Call now and save, save, save on a 25-year food supply that can save your life when disaster strikes because it will strike and it will smack you right upside the head, so keep... Wait a minute, Melvin.
[00:05:16.822 --> 00:05:19.463]  I know eFoods Direct and they're not full of hype like you.
[00:05:19.723 --> 00:05:24.544]  eFoods Direct goes to great lengths to ensure you get the best ingredients, full of nutrition and flavor.
[00:05:24.724 --> 00:05:25.664]  They are the real deal.
[00:05:25.844 --> 00:05:27.424]  Melvin, you're right about one thing, though.
[00:05:27.504 --> 00:05:30.085]  For Black Friday weekend, eFoods will save you 30% off any
[00:05:30.725 --> 00:05:31.105]  We're good to go.
[00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:05.001]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:06:05.321 --> 00:06:05.922]  Number one.
[00:06:06.222 --> 00:06:09.384]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:06:09.664 --> 00:06:10.224]  Number two.
[00:06:10.524 --> 00:06:15.067]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:06:15.407 --> 00:06:15.847]  It's true.
[00:06:16.147 --> 00:06:20.710]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.551]  Number 3.
[00:06:21.831 --> 00:06:25.135]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:06:25.435 --> 00:06:29.119]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:06:29.339 --> 00:06:29.900]  Number 4.
[00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.523]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:06:32.903 --> 00:06:36.247]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:06:36.567 --> 00:06:41.269]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:46.271]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:06:46.551 --> 00:06:50.572]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:50.732 --> 00:06:52.293]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:52.513 --> 00:06:57.115]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:07:00.596 --> 00:07:08.440]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:10.981]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:07:11.241 --> 00:07:16.463]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:07:16.624 --> 00:07:19.405]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:07:19.665 --> 00:07:21.726]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:07:21.986 --> 00:07:27.910]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:31.432]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:07:31.612 --> 00:07:37.155]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:07:37.395 --> 00:07:38.716]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:07:39.036 --> 00:07:40.257]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:07:40.337 --> 00:07:42.879]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:07:43.019 --> 00:07:47.061]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:07:47.241 --> 00:07:49.263]  You can find the video at www.
[00:07:50.023 --> 00:07:51.725]  End of America 3 dot com.
[00:07:51.845 --> 00:07:52.846]  That's End of America.
[00:07:52.966 --> 00:07:54.307]  The number 3 dot com.
[00:07:54.427 --> 00:07:58.131]  Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:00.032]  That's endofamerica3.com.
[00:08:01.214 --> 00:08:06.138]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.499 --> 00:08:08.781]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:20.162 --> 00:08:22.387]  Alex Jones, joining you here from the road.
[00:08:22.467 --> 00:08:25.413]  I'll be back in studio soon, but joining us
[00:08:27.113 --> 00:08:31.514]  Joining us from England is Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:08:31.934 --> 00:08:40.356]  We've also got Greg Pallast, investigative journalist, who is going to be joining us coming up in the second hour as well.
[00:08:40.396 --> 00:08:55.179]  He was formerly a federal crime, white collar crime investigator at the highest levels of corporate crime, so he's a perfect expert, the BBC reporter, to come on with us today and break down EMF Global and other
[00:08:55.219 --> 00:08:55.759]  We're good to go.
[00:09:19.452 --> 00:09:23.033]  concerning our reports here, if this wasn't a big issue.
[00:09:23.073 --> 00:09:24.534]  The establishment understands it.
[00:09:25.134 --> 00:09:29.135]  The Drudge Report today has a headline, Where's the Money Corzine?
[00:09:29.515 --> 00:09:30.935]  Former Governor of New Jersey.
[00:09:31.356 --> 00:09:33.596]  It's now over 1.2 billion.
[00:09:33.936 --> 00:09:43.059]  They're not saying how much over 1.2 billion, and the fact that they would take this out of segregated accounts, and the fact that they don't care.
[00:09:44.409 --> 00:09:53.255]  If the public knows about this, it shows a new level in bold, grand, mega, galactic level larceny.
[00:09:54.736 --> 00:09:56.397]  It is unspeakably huge.
[00:09:57.438 --> 00:09:58.379]  And it shows...
[00:09:59.409 --> 00:10:03.673]  How incredibly reckless these people have gotten.
[00:10:04.434 --> 00:10:18.869]  And it shows that if they can take now over 50,000 account holders' money and just say, you're not getting anything, when it was their segregated accounts, and it's clearly a federal crime, an international crime, it shows they will take anybody's accounts.
[00:10:19.449 --> 00:10:26.492]  And that will bring the entire financial system down, which is what the globalists want, so they can just offer their new world government system.
[00:10:26.812 --> 00:10:28.613]  So Greg Powell is coming up in the second hour today.
[00:10:28.633 --> 00:10:31.794]  Aaron Dykes is at the bottom of the hour with a whole bunch of news.
[00:10:32.074 --> 00:10:36.156]  He's going to rattle off a whole bunch of key information that he thinks should be front and center.
[00:10:36.176 --> 00:10:37.176]  We'll get his perspective.
[00:10:37.576 --> 00:10:41.097]  I've got a lot of news I'm going to be covering here in just a moment.
[00:10:41.898 --> 00:10:43.598]  Michael Moore blames Hollywood.
[00:10:45.851 --> 00:10:47.872]  Homeland Security propaganda.
[00:10:49.073 --> 00:10:51.675]  Of course, that's just me being sarcastic, folks.
[00:10:52.795 --> 00:11:00.560]  All of this Homeland Security activity is a bunch of security theater to basically train everyone to accept the total police state.
[00:11:00.861 --> 00:11:07.045]  But going back to the actual headline, Michael Moore blames Homeland Security for pepper spray brutality.
[00:11:07.785 --> 00:11:09.245]  We have another one here.
[00:11:09.365 --> 00:11:13.346]  Massive hydro-volcanic explosion inevitable at Fukushima.
[00:11:13.726 --> 00:11:15.187]  That's at InfoWars.com.
[00:11:15.687 --> 00:11:18.188]  TSA agents think they are above the law.
[00:11:18.628 --> 00:11:21.048]  TSA worker in uniform flashes badge.
[00:11:21.508 --> 00:11:22.869]  Brutally rapes woman.
[00:11:24.549 --> 00:11:26.309]  Well, it's administrative privilege, as they say.
[00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:31.551]  Continuing, 17 quotes about the coming global financial collapse that will make your hair stand up.
[00:11:31.571 --> 00:11:34.171]  I want to go over some of those with ballast and open the phones up.
[00:11:34.591 --> 00:11:35.132]  EU rules.
[00:11:35.152 --> 00:11:36.392]  Water doesn't hydrate.
[00:11:38.018 --> 00:11:39.199]  You can't make that up.
[00:11:39.239 --> 00:11:42.320]  You can't say water's good for you because it's not authorized by them.
[00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:44.861]  Of course, the White House regulations are.
[00:11:44.881 --> 00:11:46.881]  It says they want to make it illegal to say sunlight's good for you.
[00:11:47.642 --> 00:11:52.523]  White House targets, and of course MSM targets, Alex Jones, the Obama deception.
[00:11:52.543 --> 00:11:53.504]  We'll be breaking that down.
[00:11:53.784 --> 00:11:56.325]  The incredible attack on free speech, just how serious this is.
[00:11:56.685 --> 00:11:58.365]  It also shows how weak the globalists are.
[00:11:58.425 --> 00:11:59.486]  They wouldn't be worried about this.
[00:12:00.226 --> 00:12:01.566]  It's all coming up.
[00:12:01.586 --> 00:12:05.828]  But first, joining us with a quick report is Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:12:06.883 --> 00:12:10.909]  His report is right in the center of the Drudge Report, DrudgeReport.com today.
[00:12:10.929 --> 00:12:15.775]  Egypt's secret police renames itself Homeland Security.
[00:12:16.055 --> 00:12:19.780]  Notorious human rights abusers draws inspiration from U.S.
[00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:20.221]  authorities.
[00:12:20.521 --> 00:12:22.945]  I should also add, we only have Watson until the bottom of the hour.
[00:12:23.885 --> 00:12:26.707]  He's got to get ready to host the Nightly News tonight.
[00:12:53.786 --> 00:12:56.309]  It's 5.3 months off the year.
[00:12:56.369 --> 00:13:03.137]  When you buy a year, you get 5.3 months or almost half off on the yearly membership right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:13:04.058 --> 00:13:05.680]  Let's go now to Paul Watson.
[00:13:06.141 --> 00:13:07.302]  All over the world, Paul.
[00:13:07.342 --> 00:13:09.165]  The United States and England as well.
[00:13:09.565 --> 00:13:11.888]  Now the vanguard of high-tech police state torture.
[00:13:12.008 --> 00:13:12.808]  We're good.
[00:13:32.503 --> 00:13:36.085]  Well, I mean, Mike Adams talked about it last night on the Nightly News.
[00:13:36.105 --> 00:13:45.111]  They called it trickle-down tyranny in reference to how, you know, we had this TSA member and care home workers abusing people deemed inferior to them.
[00:13:45.492 --> 00:13:48.514]  So it's not only trickle-down, it's trickle-global.
[00:13:48.874 --> 00:13:53.797]  And you had this notorious, it was called state security Egyptian
[00:13:55.058 --> 00:13:56.559]  Secret police, basically.
[00:13:56.579 --> 00:14:04.302]  They were implicated in the imprisonment and torture of anti-Mubarak activists before that dictator fell.
[00:14:04.742 --> 00:14:10.425]  And now that the same military hunter is still in control, in anticipation of these elections,
[00:14:11.445 --> 00:14:14.546]  It was basically a footnote in the Financial Times yesterday.
[00:14:14.907 --> 00:14:15.967]  They've renamed it.
[00:14:15.987 --> 00:14:18.168]  It was called State Security.
[00:14:18.368 --> 00:14:21.549]  They've renamed it Homeland Security.
[00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:32.394]  It says, quote, under the auspices of the Ministry of Interior, the 100,000 strong State Security Service has been renamed Homeland Security and personnel
[00:14:32.774 --> 00:14:34.714]  Moved around, the Financial Times reported.
[00:14:34.994 --> 00:14:37.815]  So they're taking their inspiration from Big Sis.
[00:14:37.835 --> 00:14:51.038]  They're trying to give their secret police torture squad, which spies on protesters, just like Homeland Security, some sense of legitimacy in this reshuffling of the deck chairs.
[00:14:51.098 --> 00:14:53.218]  So it just illustrates.
[00:14:53.378 --> 00:14:55.799]  Paul, I want you to continue, but let's be fair now.
[00:14:56.439 --> 00:14:57.059]  We don't know.
[00:14:57.079 --> 00:15:00.980]  Now, we know this is America's run by the bankers, by the globalists.
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.460]  It's not fair to say America
[00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:08.606]  We've all just been hijacked by the same global technocratic management system.
[00:15:08.646 --> 00:15:13.150]  But let's be fair, we stole it here in the U.S.
[00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:16.313]  from Hitler, and then they've stolen it from us in Egypt.
[00:15:16.333 --> 00:15:19.296]  So let's be fair, we didn't invent the wheel here.
[00:15:20.077 --> 00:15:26.884]  Homeland or Reich security, Gestapo, checkpoints, black uniforms, surveillance, citizen spies,
[00:15:27.404 --> 00:15:28.165]  Hitler!
[00:15:28.665 --> 00:15:30.166]  Hitler did that!
[00:15:30.646 --> 00:15:33.148]  And let's not talk bad about the U.S.
[00:15:33.208 --> 00:15:40.092]  government or where it gets its marching orders from, modeling off of Hitler and then the Stasi later.
[00:15:40.452 --> 00:15:41.953]  So let's not talk bad about them.
[00:15:41.973 --> 00:15:49.638]  And then also expanding on that, Paul, what do you make of Michael Moore actually, a blind hog finding an acre in a broken clock being right twice a day?
[00:15:50.138 --> 00:15:52.540]  He's come out and said, which was admitted weeks ago, we reported,
[00:15:53.500 --> 00:16:00.163]  Homeland Security is directing all the attacks on Occupy Wall Street all over the country, whether you love Occupy or hate it.
[00:16:00.563 --> 00:16:05.466]  The point is they tell the homeless to go there, they release the criminals to go there, to make it look bad.
[00:16:06.326 --> 00:16:12.029]  And now Homeland Security is directing the attacks on it because George Soros and Obama couldn't co-opt it.
[00:16:13.797 --> 00:16:26.244]  Well precisely, and that's why the military hunter in Egypt has directly pointed at the work of US law enforcement authorities in dealing with these OWS protesters.
[00:16:27.024 --> 00:16:32.627]  They said that the quote firm stance justified their actions against Egyptian protesters.
[00:16:32.668 --> 00:16:37.510]  They killed obviously dozens, tortured thousands more over the past few days alone.
[00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:38.251]  So again,
[00:16:39.051 --> 00:16:44.975]  They're setting the example, and brutal third world military dictatorships are following course.
[00:16:45.035 --> 00:16:52.461]  And yeah, that's right, Moore's come out today and said that it's basically a Tiananmen Square moment for the Occupy Wall Street movement.
[00:16:55.828 --> 00:16:56.048]  I think so.
[00:17:11.323 --> 00:17:15.066]  You can't even cover your baby as they pepper spray it or that's assaulting them.
[00:17:15.367 --> 00:17:18.870]  Don't worry though, all of you fools and psychos serving the evil system.
[00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:21.212]  It's gonna suck you dry as well.
[00:17:21.412 --> 00:17:24.194]  You're gonna be judged by opening this gate to hell.
[00:17:24.475 --> 00:17:25.255]  I want you to know that.
[00:17:25.295 --> 00:17:26.216]  Watson, continue.
[00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:34.704]  But, I mean, Alex, they were blocking a path, just like the Chinese guy was blocking the tank in Tiananmen Square.
[00:17:34.724 --> 00:17:36.185]  I mean, should he have been mown down?
[00:17:36.585 --> 00:17:38.047]  There are comments on neocon...
[00:17:41.018 --> 00:17:44.725]  Get a child with it, bash its brains out, and then charge the child with assault!
[00:17:46.172 --> 00:17:52.256]  But I've read comments on neocon websites where it's like, yeah, spray the damn hippies that were blocking the path!
[00:17:52.596 --> 00:17:56.859]  So does that mean that guy should have been turned into pulp by the communist Chinese tank?
[00:17:57.319 --> 00:18:00.782]  To be fair, it's split 50-50 with these neocons.
[00:18:00.822 --> 00:18:06.385]  Some of them were saying, yeah, but even if you disagree with the protesters, it sets a horrible example, which is exactly right.
[00:18:06.726 --> 00:18:11.989]  We don't agree with every grievance that they've uttered, and in fact they've blocked us from their own official website.
[00:18:12.289 --> 00:18:15.972]  That doesn't mean we're not going to speak out against flagrant police brutality.
[00:18:16.532 --> 00:18:20.773]  That's the George Soros group on record with that site trying to control that diverse group.
[00:18:21.193 --> 00:18:24.674]  And so of course they've banned Infowars.com and Alex Jones.
[00:18:25.094 --> 00:18:27.515]  And then mixed in David Duke to make us look bad.
[00:18:27.795 --> 00:18:33.176]  I mean, look, that is exactly... Just because their leadership is authoritarian doesn't mean we're authoritarian.
[00:18:33.336 --> 00:18:39.618]  Just because everybody else is turning to evil and turning to stomping on our way of life and the Republic doesn't mean we stomp on it.
[00:18:41.015 --> 00:18:41.615]  Well, that's right.
[00:18:41.635 --> 00:18:46.899]  I mean, just as the OWS protesters can be manipulated, so are those in Egypt.
[00:18:46.959 --> 00:18:55.705]  I mean, it's the same April 6th youth movement, Mohammed ElBaradei, you know, international crisis group, that are trying to get in power.
[00:18:55.725 --> 00:19:01.108]  So they're trying to replace a hardcore arcane dictatorship with a soft, touchy-feely dictatorship.
[00:19:01.148 --> 00:19:06.732]  But again, that doesn't mean you support the brutal crackdown on protesters that we've seen over the past few days.
[00:19:07.132 --> 00:19:09.074]  So it's important to make that distinction.
[00:19:09.454 --> 00:19:10.995]  But what's also interesting, Alex,
[00:19:11.015 --> 00:19:13.757]  Well, I mean, he said that again!
[00:19:38.052 --> 00:19:47.277]  The term Occupy Wall Street is a cutout for the Democrats to claim anybody who ever protests the banking corruption is on their side.
[00:19:47.537 --> 00:19:49.758]  Then they can send their operatives after their real enemy.
[00:19:49.979 --> 00:19:53.260]  And that right there just proves that large segments of it are Soros run.
[00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:57.303]  Paul, one more segment on this situation, then Aaron Dykes is coming up, and then your phone call.
[00:19:57.323 --> 00:19:57.783]  Stay with us.

[00:20:30.669 --> 00:20:39.935]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:20:39.995 --> 00:20:40.736]  This capitalism?
[00:20:40.776 --> 00:20:46.940]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:47.881]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:20:47.921 --> 00:20:51.023]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.

[00:22:03.331 --> 00:22:07.376]  Folks, have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on?
[00:22:07.796 --> 00:22:10.780]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:15.205]  Because there's never been a better time to get ready for the winter power outages ahead.
[00:22:15.546 --> 00:22:16.146]  Here's why.
[00:22:16.547 --> 00:22:22.314]  Solar power generators are now available from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[00:22:22.654 --> 00:22:27.178]  Their emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[00:22:27.518 --> 00:22:33.603]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity from the sun.
[00:22:33.903 --> 00:22:37.506]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:22:37.746 --> 00:22:43.310]  Whether it's ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[00:22:43.691 --> 00:22:49.035]  When the power goes out this winter, you'll be ready with a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[00:22:49.295 --> 00:22:52.143]  Go to MySolarBackup.com for more information.
[00:22:52.303 --> 00:22:54.509]  That's MySolarBackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[00:23:02.981 --> 00:23:07.144]  Burglars love easy targets, like a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[00:23:07.424 --> 00:23:09.525]  Don't let your home be the next target.
[00:23:09.725 --> 00:23:13.207]  Make it look like someone is home watching television with Fake TV.
[00:23:13.628 --> 00:23:20.492]  Fake TV is a small electronic device that makes the same light as a real television, so from outside it looks like someone is home watching TV.
[00:23:20.752 --> 00:23:24.935]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing to burglars.
[00:23:25.175 --> 00:23:31.879]  Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm, comes with AC adapter, and is highly recommended by numerous police departments.
[00:23:32.179 --> 00:23:33.740]  Use it anytime you're away from home.
[00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:39.744]  To order your fake TV for only $34.95, go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.

[00:23:55.334 --> 00:23:58.016]  Faketv.com, the burglar deterrent.
[00:24:08.677 --> 00:24:10.180]  Thank you for joining us, my friends.
[00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:11.742]  Alex Jones from the road.
[00:24:11.842 --> 00:24:13.866]  I'll be back on Wednesday.
[00:24:13.886 --> 00:24:16.390]  I hope everybody has a great Thanksgiving coming up.
[00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:17.732]  We have a lot to be thankful for.
[00:24:18.173 --> 00:24:20.557]  Private property rights, the family, the Second Amendment.
[00:24:21.559 --> 00:24:26.983]  And the United States has not been perfect, but it's been the best there's been when it comes to liberty and freedom, literally the pioneer.
[00:24:27.543 --> 00:24:34.008]  It's a true shame to see it becoming a pioneer in corruption and oppression and new forms of technocratic evil.
[00:24:34.869 --> 00:24:47.598]  I saw an article where one of England's top judges admits that they're getting rid of the entire English common law and Magna Carta, which is the model of the US system and the model worldwide of freedom, and going to an EU-UN model.
[00:24:48.567 --> 00:25:02.354]  By the way, they've got, what, 31 declarations of human rights, but in the last articles, they state that you don't have any rights, and the UN says... Notice they're invading all these countries in the name of people's rights, and then putting in even more dictatorial regimes.
[00:25:03.435 --> 00:25:14.281]  You see, they want a brutal oligarchy, where you can't even pick off a single leader, and where you don't have one big ego to deal with, but just a bunch of criminals that work for you.
[00:25:15.908 --> 00:25:17.729]  Kind of like we have now with our corrupt Congress.
[00:25:17.749 --> 00:25:18.950]  That's what's being set up in Egypt.
[00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:34.239]  Uh, going back to Paul Watson, uh, Watson... Witnessing all of this happen, no one can deny now, even people who have, who are totally illiterate historically, that this is an out-of-control, globally directed, corporate...
[00:25:35.484 --> 00:25:58.735]  Creeped out, control freak, really insane tyranny, where they destroy the world system as they gobble it up, and they just hope that a bunch of paramilitary police, having their own world destroyed, their own future destroyed, are going to follow orders and beat everybody in the head, and just hope everybody's watching NASCAR and football and soccer, drooling.
[00:25:58.755 --> 00:26:00.976]  I don't think they're going to get away with it.
[00:26:01.016 --> 00:26:02.897]  I mean, their old tricks don't work anymore, Paul.
[00:26:04.517 --> 00:26:15.939]  Well, it's amazing, isn't it, that when the police were beating people up in Syria, the humanitarian crusaders, Mr. Obama and Hillary Clinton, called on Assad to step down.
[00:26:16.679 --> 00:26:24.680]  We had Libyan... they were still being called protesters by the media, even as they commandeered fighter jets and rocket-propelled grenades.
[00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:27.241]  They were being harshly treated.
[00:26:27.661 --> 00:26:29.061]  Of course, we had that invasion.
[00:26:29.381 --> 00:26:33.702]  But when dozens are killed and thousands are tortured on the streets of Cairo,
[00:26:34.542 --> 00:26:37.603]  You know, Obama and Hillary, there's barely a whimper.
[00:26:37.723 --> 00:26:41.144]  Where's the NATO-backed humanitarian intervention there?
[00:26:41.424 --> 00:26:48.986]  Where's the humanitarian intervention in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia when protesters are getting their heads cracked there on a daily basis?
[00:26:49.906 --> 00:26:52.627]  Well, I mean... Well, I mean, it's shot there.
[00:26:52.647 --> 00:26:52.727]  Yeah.
[00:26:52.747 --> 00:26:55.068]  It doesn't even make our news when they just shoot a crowd.
[00:26:56.288 --> 00:26:58.069]  Yeah, I mean, that happened today!
[00:26:59.249 --> 00:27:01.390]  It's like every day and it barely makes the news.
[00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:02.310]  But, I mean...
[00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:16.993]  1.3 billion dollars in aid in 2010 alone to Egypt's ruling military hunter kind of explains why Obama and Clinton aren't that concerned about dead protesters on the streets of Cairo.
[00:27:17.033 --> 00:27:19.494]  So again, it illustrates the hypocrisy.
[00:27:19.894 --> 00:27:29.617]  And then even if they do get rid of the military dictatorship, you've got ElBaradei and all these other, you know, CFO globalists waiting to swoop in and give them a soft dictation.
[00:27:35.162 --> 00:27:41.287]  Because the anointed mainstream media said we're not supposed to talk about international bankers and cartels.
[00:27:41.348 --> 00:27:42.669]  That's a conspiracy theory.
[00:27:42.969 --> 00:27:50.456]  Sure, they're just announcing in Time Magazine and Financial Times of London that it's a, quote, global Goldman Sachs banking dictatorship.
[00:27:50.996 --> 00:27:53.538]  And our media almost congratulates them.
[00:27:53.799 --> 00:27:54.519]  Oh, good job.
[00:27:54.539 --> 00:27:55.560]  You took everything down.
[00:27:55.881 --> 00:27:57.782]  Wow, you really control all the governments.
[00:27:58.103 --> 00:28:00.365]  But then when we say we don't want to live under these bankers,
[00:28:01.026 --> 00:28:03.377]  It's like, shut up, it doesn't exist, you insane person!
[00:28:03.578 --> 00:28:05.025]  You caused the White House shooting!
[00:28:06.769 --> 00:28:11.453]  Well, I mean precisely, and they still go on about Bilderberg and how it has no power.
[00:28:11.853 --> 00:28:24.903]  Even after the former NATO Secretary General, Will, um, Klaes from Belgium, Willy Klaes, came out and said that they go to Bilderberg, they get their orders, and then they carry them out in their different spheres of influence.
[00:28:24.963 --> 00:28:32.409]  So they admit it, the Bilderberg members admit it, and yet it's still a conspiracy theory and you're a dangerous extremist if you believe in it.
[00:28:33.269 --> 00:28:43.255]  Well, Paul, you turn out so many prolific articles that we need to get you or Kurt or Steve or Aaron or somebody to do an article saying, you know, is it still bad to talk about global government?
[00:28:43.335 --> 00:28:44.296]  Are we allowed to?
[00:28:44.636 --> 00:28:55.563]  And just be sarcastic and show like ten articles where insiders admit there's a global corporate government and then ten examples under it or five or whatever of them currently saying it doesn't exist.
[00:28:58.063 --> 00:29:01.967]  Have you seen the video of the old guy that comes up and gets mad because I'm videotaping the U.N.
[00:29:01.987 --> 00:29:04.429]  marker and saying America's being taken over?
[00:29:04.449 --> 00:29:06.911]  The Grand Canyon, yeah.
[00:29:07.251 --> 00:29:11.815]  I mean, these people, it's like, you don't get a medal when you're right, folks.
[00:29:11.835 --> 00:29:12.656]  You get attacked.
[00:29:13.517 --> 00:29:15.459]  Paul, briefly, what's coming up tonight on the Nightly News?
[00:29:16.803 --> 00:29:19.084]  Well, more detail into everything we've discussed.
[00:29:19.104 --> 00:29:24.128]  We've also got a computerised contact lens that will keep you up to date with news and texts.
[00:29:24.688 --> 00:29:24.868]  Oh!
[00:29:25.929 --> 00:29:26.909]  Very convenient.
[00:29:26.949 --> 00:29:29.871]  I'm sure there's no privacy implications whatsoever with that.
[00:29:30.432 --> 00:29:40.138]  So obviously we've got Ron Paul gets occupied, we've got this TSA rape case, we've got the whole Egypt situation, and more on Homeland Security.
[00:29:40.778 --> 00:29:41.940]  Alright, great job watching.
[00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:46.246]  Watch it over at PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com, and read his article at DrugsReport.com.
[00:29:46.426 --> 00:29:47.588]  We'll be right back with Aaron Dyche.
[00:29:47.708 --> 00:29:48.269]  Stay with us.
[00:29:50.331 --> 00:29:51.253]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.753 --> 00:29:53.356]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.257 --> 00:29:56.980]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.895 --> 00:30:06.517]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:30:06.857 --> 00:30:14.980]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:19.762]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:30:20.342 --> 00:30:31.167]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:30:31.787 --> 00:30:40.814]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:30:41.315 --> 00:30:46.359]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:30:46.739 --> 00:30:53.924]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:30:54.245 --> 00:30:56.987]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:31:02.139 --> 00:31:05.763]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:31:06.143 --> 00:31:09.147]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:31:09.407 --> 00:31:14.172]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:31:14.192 --> 00:31:20.419]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:31:20.599 --> 00:31:22.821]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:31:23.362 --> 00:31:23.642]  Tim Geithner?
[00:31:23.662 --> 00:31:24.082]  Bernanke?
[00:31:24.183 --> 00:31:24.783]  They're arsonists!
[00:31:24.843 --> 00:31:25.843]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:31:25.944 --> 00:31:28.365]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:31:42.253 --> 00:31:44.094]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:31:44.394 --> 00:31:49.157]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:31:49.537 --> 00:31:58.642]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.282]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[00:32:06.702 --> 00:32:12.565]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[00:32:13.126 --> 00:32:14.866]  Number one, study the past.
[00:32:15.387 --> 00:32:17.148]  History really does repeat itself.
[00:32:17.788 --> 00:32:21.510]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[00:32:22.648 --> 00:32:24.910]  Number three, take decisive action.
[00:32:25.731 --> 00:32:29.013]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[00:32:29.574 --> 00:32:38.081]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves, warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[00:32:38.621 --> 00:32:41.504]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[00:32:42.044 --> 00:32:45.687]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:32:46.528 --> 00:32:50.774]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[00:32:51.454 --> 00:32:55.580]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:58.764]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:33:13.889 --> 00:33:14.950]  I'm still on the road.
[00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:17.552]  I'll be back in Austin tomorrow.
[00:33:18.132 --> 00:33:22.115]  Mike Adams will be sitting in on the radio tomorrow, but I'll undoubtedly call in.
[00:33:22.135 --> 00:33:25.938]  Normally I join you from the road via video, Skype, and great audio.
[00:33:25.978 --> 00:33:29.201]  I apologize for being on the phone, but it's the information that counts.
[00:33:29.241 --> 00:33:32.483]  But we do have in-studio writing shotgun there in the professional
[00:33:32.563 --> 00:33:33.164]  We're good to go.
[00:33:51.759 --> 00:33:53.200]  Insight, this is from Reuters.
[00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:58.002]  Farm belt rage over MF Global could chill markets.
[00:33:58.262 --> 00:33:59.962]  We've been saying that for several weeks now.
[00:34:00.663 --> 00:34:04.504]  Oh, but we're bad, the media says, of course.
[00:34:04.524 --> 00:34:09.526]  Anger rises as MF Global clients see funds frozen.
[00:34:10.407 --> 00:34:13.268]  Oh, so that's just some of what is
[00:34:13.988 --> 00:34:19.252]  Uh, going on right now that we're going to be, uh, breaking down.
[00:34:19.352 --> 00:34:21.233]  Obama has pardoned dope dealers.
[00:34:21.634 --> 00:34:22.635]  Well, Clinton did that, too.
[00:34:22.655 --> 00:34:23.475]  I mean, these are gangsters.
[00:34:23.895 --> 00:34:25.777]  Chicago jewel thief has pardoned.
[00:34:26.417 --> 00:34:30.000]  And, see, it's only the general public that has a book thrown at them for no reason.
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:35.004]  Political fixer and Obama pal, Tony Rescoe, said it today.
[00:34:36.934 --> 00:34:41.298]  Anti-Obama sales outpace pro-Obama fourfold in online clothier.
[00:34:41.678 --> 00:34:42.699]  We've got all those articles.
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:52.087]  By the way, if you want to support us and our news operation, we've got plenty of t-shirts and materials exposing Obama as a puppet at InfoWars.com.
[00:34:52.107 --> 00:34:55.149]  And of course, we have the Obama Deception on DVD.
[00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:59.813]  Anybody can watch it in decent quality on YouTube or Google Video.
[00:35:00.194 --> 00:35:05.018]  Over 35 million views total out there that we know of, not counting BitTorrents and other systems, but
[00:35:05.798 --> 00:35:09.100]  We do have a concerted effort to demonize the Obama deception.
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:13.542]  It's part of a whole history of this, and it shows actually how weak these globalists are.
[00:35:13.562 --> 00:35:29.351]  So after we cover some of the news, we're there, and I'm getting into the latest on MF Global, then I'm getting into the fact that they've tried to basically connect us to the latest reported shooter, who his friends said thought he was Jesus, and thought Obama was the Antichrist.
[00:35:29.391 --> 00:35:29.971]  We don't think Obama
[00:35:33.718 --> 00:35:34.139]  I don't know.
[00:35:55.759 --> 00:36:12.809]  Speaking of supporting the broadcast, when you support our local AM and FM affiliates by going to their sponsors and supporting them, or becoming a sponsor of your local business or that station, it helps us reach millions of people who have not heard the truth, who've never actually understood this information.
[00:36:14.109 --> 00:36:22.757]  It also helps us reach still millions more who didn't think the New World Order was real, but now see it all coming true and are ready to listen and ready to take action.
[00:36:23.117 --> 00:36:28.642]  It is so valuable to the future of humanity that we're on all these AM and FM stations, so please support them.
[00:36:29.739 --> 00:36:36.864]  Also support our national sponsors and support the sponsors that you see at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:36:36.904 --> 00:36:39.786]  And remember, they're trying to bring in the internet kill switch.
[00:36:39.826 --> 00:36:42.828]  They're trying to bring in the copyright stuff where there's no judge, no jury.
[00:36:43.108 --> 00:36:44.509]  They just shut you down for no reason.
[00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:46.491]  I mean, that's even members of Congress.
[00:36:46.531 --> 00:36:49.953]  That's even CNET saying it's the end of the internet and free speech as we know it.
[00:36:50.293 --> 00:36:54.216]  They're trying to pass all of this right now.
[00:36:54.336 --> 00:36:55.217]  This is real.
[00:36:58.641 --> 00:37:01.605]  The URL, Twitter, InfoWars.
[00:37:02.606 --> 00:37:03.627]  Pound InfoWars.
[00:37:03.687 --> 00:37:04.688]  Now we've learned more about Twitter.
[00:37:04.728 --> 00:37:05.729]  That's how you actually do it.
[00:37:05.749 --> 00:37:06.750]  You pound InfoWars.
[00:37:07.531 --> 00:37:11.316]  And then that gets everybody else to link up to it and get it out to everybody.
[00:37:12.896 --> 00:37:16.080]  It is so important to fight these mafias.
[00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:19.443]  It's so important that if we're going to go head up against the globalists, we go 110%.
[00:37:19.483 --> 00:37:19.443]  110%.
[00:37:19.503 --> 00:37:21.325]  That means all out, not holding back.
[00:37:21.365 --> 00:37:23.828]  You know, growing up I thought 110% was a stupid term.
[00:37:30.945 --> 00:37:31.886]  It really is more than that.
[00:37:32.226 --> 00:37:33.627]  You want to go 200 percent.
[00:37:33.987 --> 00:37:35.188]  You want to go 300 percent.
[00:37:35.228 --> 00:37:36.249]  You want to go 400 percent.
[00:37:36.569 --> 00:37:40.672]  Because what you think is 100 percent, the mind has governors in it.
[00:37:40.752 --> 00:37:45.055]  Just like a race car will have a governor, or a city bus will have a governor.
[00:37:45.375 --> 00:37:49.678]  That city bus can probably go 100 miles an hour, but it's governed back to 55 miles an hour.
[00:37:49.958 --> 00:37:54.842]  Most 18-wheelers can go 100 miles an hour, but they're governed back to 65 miles an hour.
[00:37:55.262 --> 00:37:58.364]  Back when the speed limit was 55, they were governed to 56.
[00:38:00.638 --> 00:38:01.738]  You have a governor.
[00:38:02.819 --> 00:38:04.939]  And the globalists actually use those governors.
[00:38:04.979 --> 00:38:09.181]  They manipulate you and teach you to stand down and not be involved and not be informed.
[00:38:09.581 --> 00:38:10.381]  You've got to go 110%.
[00:38:11.442 --> 00:38:16.423]  And when you learn you can go 10% over 100, you're going to find you can go 120%.
[00:38:17.063 --> 00:38:17.704]  You can go 130%.
[00:38:17.764 --> 00:38:21.285]  That's why they do hypnotism with athletes and they found it really works.
[00:38:21.745 --> 00:38:24.486]  They can take some guy who can usually only bench press 500 pounds.
[00:38:24.906 --> 00:38:28.067]  He can suddenly bench press 600 pounds under hypnosis.
[00:38:28.807 --> 00:38:34.873]  Again, you can consciously, and I'm not saying I've excelled at anything, you've just got to believe that you can take action.
[00:38:35.073 --> 00:38:37.275]  You've got to understand that you've got to know you have power.
[00:38:37.695 --> 00:38:41.478]  Everything the globalists do is social conditioning.
[00:38:41.859 --> 00:38:45.622]  Psychological psy-op warfare to teach you you're a piece of garbage.
[00:38:46.983 --> 00:38:49.305]  The system is scared of the Obama deception.
[00:38:49.505 --> 00:38:52.888]  Look at the fact of everything they've done to attack it over the last three years.
[00:38:52.928 --> 00:38:53.649]  I'll get to that later.
[00:38:53.669 --> 00:38:56.231]  The point is, we're offering this until Christmas.
[00:38:59.838 --> 00:39:01.238]  We're good to go.
[00:39:30.287 --> 00:39:32.508]  The point is, just go look at the whole list at InfoWars.com.
[00:39:32.849 --> 00:39:34.149]  There's 18 films.
[00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:36.031]  They're all right there for $99.95.
[00:39:38.832 --> 00:39:43.155]  All 18 of the films that are on DVD.
[00:39:43.175 --> 00:39:44.416]  I think it's more than 18.
[00:39:44.496 --> 00:39:45.857]  I'm on the road.
[00:39:45.877 --> 00:39:46.637]  The point is, go read it.
[00:39:46.657 --> 00:39:47.378]  Go look at it for yourself.
[00:39:48.991 --> 00:39:50.772]  $99.95.
[00:39:49.071 --> 00:39:50.772]  Normally $359.95.
[00:39:51.172 --> 00:39:51.413]  Now $99.95.
[00:39:52.293 --> 00:39:55.554]  That's a $260 discount.
[00:39:55.615 --> 00:39:59.476]  Infowars.com.
[00:40:00.217 --> 00:40:03.778]  And you can do all your Christmas shopping or holiday shopping at one time.
[00:40:03.798 --> 00:40:06.600]  Buy a couple of those packages and give people the films.
[00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:07.520]  Open them.
[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:08.361]  Make copies of them.
[00:40:08.581 --> 00:40:09.601]  Air them on AXS TV.
[00:40:09.821 --> 00:40:12.443]  I don't say it's okay to make copies of my films.
[00:40:12.823 --> 00:40:15.024]  I'm basically ordering you to if you love liberty.
[00:40:15.802 --> 00:40:16.623]  I mean, it's not an order.
[00:40:17.043 --> 00:40:21.347]  You should be doing whatever you can to wake people up and fight the globalists, even if it's small.
[00:40:22.028 --> 00:40:24.991]  Because it's that spirit of resistance that will grow into a mighty oak.
[00:40:25.291 --> 00:40:26.352]  It's the mustard seed.
[00:40:26.752 --> 00:40:29.274]  You take action on little things, doors open.
[00:40:29.955 --> 00:40:31.577]  This is spiritual, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:31.637 --> 00:40:33.418]  I don't want to get off into it.
[00:40:33.839 --> 00:40:35.280]  Just experience it for yourself.
[00:40:36.501 --> 00:40:38.683]  What do our guests like Celente always say?
[00:40:40.305 --> 00:40:41.466]  Or George Humphrey also says it.
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:44.921]  When the student is ready, the teacher appears.
[00:40:45.021 --> 00:40:47.023]  You have to get in the ring.
[00:40:48.264 --> 00:40:51.486]  You gotta get on the horse to learn how to ride.
[00:40:51.786 --> 00:40:54.128]  You gotta get in the ring to learn how to fight.
[00:40:54.448 --> 00:40:57.170]  You can go out and take martial arts all day.
[00:40:57.210 --> 00:40:58.031]  You can go out, whatever.
[00:40:58.271 --> 00:41:02.034]  There's nothing that'll teach you, like, how to fight than, like, being in a hundred of them.
[00:41:03.855 --> 00:41:04.215]  Okay?
[00:41:04.435 --> 00:41:05.356]  It's the same thing.
[00:41:05.436 --> 00:41:07.578]  You gotta get on the horse.
[00:41:08.797 --> 00:41:12.099]  You're never going to learn how to drive a tractor until you get on the tractor.
[00:41:12.499 --> 00:41:14.180]  The globalists want to keep you in a little box.
[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:15.681]  Get those DVDs.
[00:41:16.381 --> 00:41:17.642]  Get them out to everybody you know.
[00:41:18.002 --> 00:41:27.088]  And more importantly, go to InfoWars.com, the articles we did last night about how they're trying to censor it, and get that free video link to the one version.
[00:41:27.108 --> 00:41:30.610]  It's the highest quality I've seen online for free.
[00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:31.670]  9.5 plus million views.
[00:41:31.770 --> 00:41:35.612]  And get it out to everybody because they're trying to take it down right now.
[00:41:35.672 --> 00:41:36.053]  So again,
[00:41:37.253 --> 00:41:38.374]  Let's go to Aaron Dykes.
[00:41:38.454 --> 00:41:40.595]  Aaron, you've got a cornucopia of news.
[00:41:40.635 --> 00:41:46.820]  You take the helm, because I'll interrupt if I don't actually sit back here for the next 10 minutes.
[00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:54.385]  You take a step and a break with the news and analysis, and then I'm going to come back and tell folks about the Obama situation and the MF Global.
[00:41:54.405 --> 00:41:56.587]  I know you've got some MF Global there, so we want to get to that.
[00:41:56.967 --> 00:42:05.613]  Oh, all these people think Celente deserved to have his private account taken, because he was in, you know, it was money he'd gotten in derivatives that was, or not derivatives, in
[00:42:07.094 --> 00:42:08.935]  Future that was his under law?
[00:42:09.595 --> 00:42:14.016]  Oh, now they're saying they're going to take the farmer's... the farmer's stuff.
[00:42:14.236 --> 00:42:15.917]  Oh, I guess they're going to deserve it, too.
[00:42:16.237 --> 00:42:21.338]  And then all of you, when you lose your bank accounts that are you all for this stuff, I guess you're going to deserve it as well.
[00:42:21.438 --> 00:42:25.159]  Or when they devalue our dollar more, I guess, I guess all of us deserve it.
[00:42:26.079 --> 00:42:34.882]  Well, I guess in a sick way we do for living in denial and letting a bunch of crooks get control of us and teach us it's okay for them to grab our children's genitals.
[00:42:35.382 --> 00:42:37.583]  And by the way, there's more TSA in the news.
[00:42:38.303 --> 00:42:40.104]  More TSA pedophiles.
[00:42:40.524 --> 00:42:42.084]  More TSA rapes.
[00:42:42.625 --> 00:42:50.847]  More evil just oozing out of the big sewer line that is the federal government and all the trash and nobody control freaks.
[00:42:51.087 --> 00:43:00.611]  They've hired as an army of darkness, as our founding fathers warned of, new offices and swarms of agents to eat out our sustenance, eat out our substance.
[00:43:00.651 --> 00:43:02.171]  The baton is handed to Aaron Dice.
[00:43:02.491 --> 00:43:03.892]  Aaron, give us a news breakdown.
[00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:06.151]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[00:43:06.511 --> 00:43:21.622]  I mean, first what you're talking about, about power on that spiritual and higher level, it really factors in because so much of this New World Order system is that general generic pressure in whatever our capacity is to roll over, to absorb into that Borg system.
[00:43:22.242 --> 00:43:26.524]  And it's really so many times when we say no, that we have that power.
[00:43:26.584 --> 00:43:30.785]  It's not when you put on a TSA uniform and scream at people, I have the power.
[00:43:30.905 --> 00:43:36.248]  It's when you actually stand up for something that matters, for a principle or what have you.
[00:43:36.688 --> 00:43:39.589]  And all that power in the uniform really goes to the system.
[00:43:39.629 --> 00:43:41.230]  It doesn't go to the individual.
[00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:44.771]  And just joining that system is how we become so vulnerable.
[00:43:45.211 --> 00:44:13.950]  I mean it's very evident in the economic problems we face because they've asked us all over decades of globalization to bind together under that fascist branch to leverage our debts together to interconnect the world at such a level that no one can even understand the level of financial fraud going on because of all the derivatives and cross bets and and credit default swaps and all the other complicated mechanisms that are threatening the system now Alex and you see that here again with
[00:44:15.071 --> 00:44:19.554]  Times headline, can the US Federal Reserve help save Europe's banks?
[00:44:20.274 --> 00:44:28.539]  And those of us who've been following the news have known for some time that the Federal Reserve has been secretly giving money to Europe and their top banks.
[00:44:29.299 --> 00:44:33.962]  But that had to come out through a lot of pressure on the Federal Reserve here politically in the US.
[00:44:34.402 --> 00:44:38.485]  And yet here it is just casually admitted that the US Federal Reserve has been pumping
[00:44:39.045 --> 00:45:00.058]  Billions of dollars into Europe's banking system in recent weeks to help stabilize the continent's financial crisis and it goes on to how there's an agreement signed between the New York Fed and the European Central Bank to swap dollars at a fixed exchange rate and how they want that Federal Reserve quote big bazooka on the table so they don't have to use it.
[00:45:00.418 --> 00:45:07.282]  That's the same thing they said about the new financial vehicle they want set up in Europe under Merkel and Sarkozy.
[00:45:07.322 --> 00:45:08.343]  They want an unlimited
[00:45:09.024 --> 00:45:11.370]  ...financial bazooka that they can use at will.
[00:45:11.410 --> 00:45:16.965]  They just want an unlimited pile of money and something you've talked about recently Alex has been...
[00:45:19.432 --> 00:45:22.253]  And remember, this is a class of criminals, Aaron.
[00:45:22.673 --> 00:45:25.674]  Here I am interrupting because you're addressing me and bringing up these points.
[00:45:25.694 --> 00:45:27.975]  I want you to go back to your next one.
[00:45:27.995 --> 00:45:35.337]  Remember, it's all a bunch of crooks like Corzine and Madoff and Ken Lay who came up with all of this crud.
[00:45:35.357 --> 00:45:43.219]  It's just a bunch of crooks like, you know, the head of Italy, Berlusconi, who just had to step down.
[00:45:43.239 --> 00:45:44.499]  Look at them.
[00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:46.200]  They're all a bunch of crooks.
[00:45:47.651 --> 00:45:48.712]  We're good to go.
[00:46:22.444 --> 00:46:34.731]  I agree, Alex, and how sad is it that all the secret police that have unfortunately been trained by elements of the US government, you know, ties back to even the Nazi regime, are now taking the moniker Homeland Security.
[00:46:34.791 --> 00:46:38.194]  It's just a bad sign to pass that baton of undue
[00:46:38.994 --> 00:46:56.546]  Secret police power and then even adopt the names and share them throughout the generations as you know homeland security goes back to the Nazi regime as well but but getting back to the European financial news of the current day it's also interesting that Bloomberg has the headline Kissinger's favorite communist
[00:46:57.026 --> 00:47:17.595]  Paves the way for Mario Monti to govern Italy, and it talks about the aging president, Giorgio Napolitano, largely a figurehead, who nonetheless cleared the way for the Bilderberg technocrat, yeah, looter, Mario Monti, who's totally used to be part of Goldman Sachs or related to it, like so many other important people in this system.
[00:47:18.135 --> 00:47:25.798]  And the other article I had next to me got into how the European Central Bank head, I think that's Draghi, is connected to Goldman Sachs.
[00:47:26.258 --> 00:47:43.476]  And all these other key figures, even as you have MF Global, also with Corzine, formerly head of Goldman Sachs, now kind of the canary in the coal mine for all the missing money that is yet to come, I think really paving the way for the next giant global collapse, as so many others have said on this program.
[00:47:43.837 --> 00:47:46.319]  But the fact that Kissinger has this favorite communist
[00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:59.713]  Kind of gives away a lot of his past activity in Italy where, you know, secret police type activity repressed a lot of the legitimate government there and many aspects of that foreign policy became a client state deal.
[00:48:00.093 --> 00:48:04.418]  Now it's still happening today with the same banker crew running the scene.
[00:48:05.959 --> 00:48:21.670]  I don't know if you're still ready to go, Alex, but The Independent has the headline, What Price the New Democracy Goldman Sachs Conquers Europe, and it gets into what I was just talking about, how senior advisors at Goldman Sachs are in charge of the Western nation.
[00:48:21.710 --> 00:48:28.335]  They're bringing up their Mario Monti, and it gets into what they're calling the Goldman Sachs Project in Europe.
[00:48:28.795 --> 00:48:29.336]  We're good.
[00:48:43.932 --> 00:48:46.193]  He just resigned, but there are others as well.
[00:48:46.273 --> 00:48:47.494]  It's a pretty lengthy article.
[00:48:47.894 --> 00:48:49.275]  We're not going to cover it all here today.
[00:48:50.496 --> 00:49:02.322]  But just look at the bait-and-switch putting the pressure on all these European nations that they owe this debt, when in fact it was created, really a created pretext and problem set up by the banks.
[00:49:03.203 --> 00:49:09.466]  Somewhere from yesterday, Stack, they had an article from back in August talking about why isn't Iceland more in the news?
[00:49:10.027 --> 00:49:12.388]  A great example of a small country that said no
[00:49:12.828 --> 00:49:13.048]  So first...
[00:49:29.462 --> 00:49:30.143]  I'm frustrated, Aaron.
[00:49:30.263 --> 00:49:31.364]  That's why I'm so frustrated.
[00:49:31.724 --> 00:49:34.487]  We are here at the crossroads now.
[00:49:34.587 --> 00:49:46.720]  They're making their bold and insanely out of control, insanely naked, hubris-filled arrogance, chutzpah, bravada, aplomb-filled
[00:49:47.781 --> 00:50:01.677]  Macho, in-our-face, over-the-top, arrogant, con-artist move with just flagrant stealing and tyranny and classical corruption and torture and evil and treason right out in front of us.
[00:50:02.418 --> 00:50:10.464]  And the public, some of them are awake, but the security forces are just a bunch of treasonous miscreants, and we are going over the side of the cliff right now.
[00:50:10.484 --> 00:50:15.047]  We've still got time to turn back, and it's so easy just to see these crooks for who they are.
[00:50:15.427 --> 00:50:22.892]  If we were like the Icelanders, who are highly educated and informed on average, and intellectual, they are one of the most highly educated groups in the world.
[00:50:23.272 --> 00:50:26.875]  I mean, I just, you know, America just may be a big fat hog that wants to get slaughtered.
[00:50:27.675 --> 00:50:30.057]  And if that's what you want, folks, it's what you're going.
[00:50:30.097 --> 00:50:31.778]  I'm Alex Jones here in Dykes, coming up.
[00:50:31.798 --> 00:50:33.199]  Greg Palastrate ahead, stay with us.
[00:51:01.024 --> 00:51:05.610]  With new financial dominoes falling each day, do you know who really runs this country?
[00:51:05.931 --> 00:51:09.535]  This is Alex Jones with a special message about the gangster economy.
[00:51:09.836 --> 00:51:15.964]  Folks, if you're lucky enough to have a little money set aside for a rainy day, this could be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[00:51:16.004 --> 00:51:16.904]  We're good to go.
[00:51:39.592 --> 00:51:43.215]  Learn ingenious ways to profit in the new gangster economy.

[00:52:00.819 --> 00:52:06.325]  There are limitless ways to go into business for yourself, but most involve substantial capital and risk.

[00:53:12.878 --> 00:53:16.481]  A big Berkey water filter gives them protection from bacteria, heavy metals,
[00:53:16.761 --> 00:53:20.244]  Chlorine, fluoride, pesticides and herbicides, VOCs and more.
[00:53:20.504 --> 00:53:25.849]  And best of all, a big Berkey water filter is a gift that lasts for many years with no additional investment.
[00:53:26.090 --> 00:53:29.833]  And that saves time and money in filter replacements that other water filters require.
[00:53:30.153 --> 00:53:35.178]  And are even powerful enough to purify treated, untreated or even stagnant pond water.

[00:53:50.025 --> 00:53:52.606]  Or call 877-99-BERKEY.
[00:53:52.906 --> 00:53:56.447]  That's 877-99-BER-K-E-Y.
[00:53:56.848 --> 00:53:58.028]  Gift well this Christmas.
[00:53:58.248 --> 00:53:59.689]  Give a Big Berkey Water Filter!
[00:54:16.004 --> 00:54:21.685]  We are back live and I just start ranting when I think about how true all of this is coming.
[00:54:22.445 --> 00:54:28.386]  When I think about how right we've been and how right we're going to be about the next phases of this situation.
[00:54:29.926 --> 00:54:41.448]  And getting briefly into this whole Obama deception situation, the FBI visited our office a week before it was scheduled to be released and kept asking about the Obama deception.
[00:54:41.889 --> 00:54:44.049]  Then they were calling people on
[00:54:46.900 --> 00:54:47.320]  We're good to go.
[00:55:13.923 --> 00:55:17.926]  And they wouldn't tell me why the FBI was coming, just that they'd be showing up the next day.
[00:55:17.946 --> 00:55:19.488]  And they had a subpoena.
[00:55:20.689 --> 00:55:27.314]  And so then the FBI shows up with an Austin cop, and won't say what it's really about, and then it leaves.
[00:55:28.775 --> 00:55:33.559]  And then, the other FBI agent calls back and says, don't talk about it.
[00:55:34.019 --> 00:55:36.421]  You know, you know there's a gag order, read that order.
[00:55:38.123 --> 00:55:43.327]  And then I go on air and I say, well I'm told not to talk about this, but the FBI was here talking about the Obama deception.
[00:55:45.438 --> 00:55:48.499]  I said I'm going to go ahead and release it a couple days early because I don't know what's going on.
[00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:55.122]  Now it turned out it was over somebody threatening police on my website in the comments and later that came out in the Associated Press.
[00:55:55.322 --> 00:55:56.482]  I didn't even know what it was about.
[00:55:57.403 --> 00:55:58.183]  They wouldn't tell me.
[00:55:59.624 --> 00:56:02.925]  But they were using it as an excuse to ask about the Obama deception.
[00:56:04.106 --> 00:56:07.627]  And we got the site hacked and the video removed.
[00:56:10.011 --> 00:56:11.412]  It's where it said removed by user.
[00:56:11.472 --> 00:56:12.752]  Anybody who has a YouTube account knows.
[00:56:12.992 --> 00:56:14.073]  They never restore that.
[00:56:14.453 --> 00:56:20.255]  We raised Cain on it and they went in and did an investigation and did it to say yes it was entered by someone else.
[00:56:21.476 --> 00:56:22.896]  I had it erased and they restored it.
[00:56:23.036 --> 00:56:24.237]  First time that's ever happened.
[00:56:25.037 --> 00:56:28.979]  We've had a bunch of other dirty tricks involving it.
[00:56:29.059 --> 00:56:31.980]  I've had Nightline come down and say, won't your film cause violence?
[00:56:32.020 --> 00:56:32.720]  Aren't you concerned?
[00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:35.001]  When the whole film is against violence.
[00:56:35.761 --> 00:56:37.162]  It's about Obama being a puppet.
[00:56:37.958 --> 00:56:41.100]  This is the type of film that would make somebody not want to attack Obama.
[00:56:42.001 --> 00:56:45.403]  You know, generally a schizophrenic type that thinks they're Jesus and he's the devil.
[00:56:45.963 --> 00:56:47.844]  I've had schizophrenics like that on me before.
[00:56:48.365 --> 00:56:50.706]  They're Christ, I'm the devil, I've gotta die.
[00:56:51.287 --> 00:56:55.849]  It's just some type of archetype, and that's what they alleged this guy was doing, and now I've seen videos of him.
[00:56:55.869 --> 00:56:57.330]  Yeah, totally crazy.
[00:56:57.991 --> 00:57:00.613]  And a year ago at some party, he watched the Obama deception.
[00:57:00.993 --> 00:57:07.557]  I've read his material, it's all about how, or seen his video, it's all about how Obama's the devil and he's Christ and he's Jesus and he's gonna get it.
[00:57:09.534 --> 00:57:11.238]  That Obama wasn't even there when it happened.
[00:57:12.079 --> 00:57:13.021]  Might be a false flag.
[00:57:13.222 --> 00:57:13.883]  I don't know.
[00:57:14.845 --> 00:57:18.012]  They love to blame stuff on crazy people because they can't talk straight.
[00:57:19.906 --> 00:57:20.647]  We're good to go.
[00:57:43.031 --> 00:57:44.532]  Yeah, I agree with Alex.
[00:57:45.072 --> 00:58:00.418]  Let's get Obama, rest in peace Obama, with clear spam accounts, probably Democratic operatives, just to associate violence with that particular 9.5 million viewed one, which is really scaring the establishment.
[00:58:00.438 --> 00:58:06.000]  I'm going to come back with MF Global with Greg Palast, huge developments on that front, and Aaron will be back with us in the third hour.
[00:58:06.381 --> 00:58:08.601]  He'll be riding shotgun with Palast off and on.
[00:58:09.242 --> 00:58:12.183]  But what's your comments on this whole Obama deception situation, Aaron?
[00:58:13.021 --> 00:58:18.462]  Well, I'm flabbergasted, but of course, again, it's about who is behind the throne, and we know who that are.
[00:58:18.582 --> 00:58:20.263]  It's not vague, it's specific.
[00:58:20.323 --> 00:58:24.964]  It's Council on Foreign Relations, Bilderbergers, and others who are part of this New World Order conspiracy.
[00:58:24.984 --> 00:58:26.424]  That's what the film is really about.
[00:58:28.004 --> 00:58:29.285]  And that's the focus of it.
[00:58:29.785 --> 00:58:30.585]  And they don't like that.
[00:58:31.145 --> 00:58:33.566]  They don't like it because people think they're going to hear about Obama.
[00:58:34.266 --> 00:58:36.746]  And they actually write out about the New World Order.
[00:58:37.086 --> 00:58:37.927]  Get it out to everybody.
[00:58:37.947 --> 00:58:38.787]  They're scared of this stuff.
[00:58:38.867 --> 00:58:39.547]  It's like...
[00:58:43.650 --> 00:58:47.511]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:51.032 --> 00:58:52.152]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:58:52.192 --> 00:58:58.874]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:58:59.134 --> 00:59:01.415]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:59:01.675 --> 00:59:06.897]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:59:07.057 --> 00:59:09.837]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:59:10.097 --> 00:59:12.158]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:59:12.418 --> 00:59:18.341]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:59:18.661 --> 00:59:21.863]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:59:22.043 --> 00:59:27.566]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:59:27.826 --> 00:59:29.127]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:59:29.467 --> 00:59:30.628]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:59:30.768 --> 00:59:33.309]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:59:33.429 --> 00:59:37.491]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:59:37.652 --> 00:59:39.372]  You can find the video at www.
[00:59:40.453 --> 00:59:42.155]  End of America 3.com.
[00:59:42.275 --> 00:59:44.739]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[00:59:53.870 --> 00:59:55.792]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.273 --> 00:59:59.056]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.714 --> 01:00:09.876]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.537 --> 01:00:11.337]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.138 --> 01:00:13.058]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.679 --> 01:00:17.301]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.861 --> 01:00:21.923]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.466 --> 01:00:30.971]  Okay, my friends, Greg Palast is coming up to break down the incredible developments with MF Global.
[01:00:31.651 --> 01:00:42.560]  I mean, do people realize how big this is, that a company could just say we're keeping 1.2 million or more of people's private, segregated accounts, and that the media hasn't really made a big deal about it?
[01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:45.062]  I mean, it's finally starting to get attention, but...
[01:00:46.414 --> 01:00:57.279]  If you look at how many people in the Republican and Democratic parties, but particularly the Democratic parties, are just out-and-out, villainous, street-thug-type criminals.
[01:00:57.299 --> 01:01:02.921]  A lot of Republican leaders, they do it through big, giant, global contracts, Halliburton, stuff like that.
[01:01:02.941 --> 01:01:04.862]  It's just as corrupt, or more so.
[01:01:05.442 --> 01:01:09.444]  But with the Democrats, it's a gutter-type thing, like with Bill Clinton.
[01:01:10.507 --> 01:01:15.589]  Being out of Arkansas, flying the cocaine in, and he was there with his limo, taking delivery.
[01:01:16.809 --> 01:01:20.471]  And he was overseeing who would be murdered, and personally raping the women.
[01:01:21.671 --> 01:01:22.532]  Here's another headline.
[01:01:22.572 --> 01:01:29.274]  Political fixer and Obama pal, Tony Resco, gets 10 years in jail.
[01:01:30.114 --> 01:01:31.255]  Isn't that precious?
[01:01:31.895 --> 01:01:34.016]  Again, Obama pardons dope dealers.
[01:01:34.556 --> 01:01:36.677]  Chicago jewel thief pardoned.
[01:01:38.784 --> 01:01:50.491]  Uh, Nancy Pelosi's using Occupy Wall Street to raise cash when she's totally controlled by the corrupt elements of Wall Street that are using big government control and selective enforcement to shut down their competition.
[01:01:51.031 --> 01:01:54.954]  See, it's not either you're for free market, let banks run over you and let them get banker bailouts.
[01:01:55.294 --> 01:01:58.676]  Well, I guess it's very free market to give them banker bailouts, can many lying conservatives say?
[01:01:59.977 --> 01:02:05.320]  It's mega-banks waging war against the real economy.
[01:02:06.519 --> 01:02:07.200]  Here's another one.
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:08.220]  Where's the cash?
[01:02:08.401 --> 01:02:14.486]  Corzine, uh, you know, again, is the New York Times saying, where is the 1.2 billion plus?
[01:02:15.126 --> 01:02:21.871]  And while MF Global shortfall doubles to over 1.2 billion, anger raises as client C funds frozen.
[01:02:22.432 --> 01:02:24.133]  Farm belt rage!
[01:02:25.294 --> 01:02:27.375]  That's right, Farm Belt Rage!
[01:02:27.855 --> 01:02:38.781]  Well, don't worry that the Farm Belt's just going to be imploded and taken over and bankrupted, because they've now got the Rural Affairs Council under the Department of Defense and Homeland Security.
[01:02:38.881 --> 01:02:39.881]  Land Security.
[01:02:40.622 --> 01:02:43.763]  I mean, that is going to keep everybody just incredibly safe.
[01:02:43.803 --> 01:02:45.424]  Everything's going to be wonderful.
[01:02:45.464 --> 01:02:48.306]  And so what if they don't pay people back and it destroys confidence?
[01:02:48.646 --> 01:02:51.347]  When the markets implode even more, the bankers will just take that over.
[01:02:51.367 --> 01:02:52.748]  It's all part of the fun.
[01:02:54.246 --> 01:02:56.888]  A man destruction, or creative destruction as they call it.
[01:02:57.208 --> 01:02:58.609]  Does it look creative to you?
[01:02:59.069 --> 01:03:01.611]  The economy falling apart and sinking into a depression?
[01:03:01.631 --> 01:03:02.672]  It does to them.
[01:03:02.692 --> 01:03:14.160]  Farm belt rage over MF Global could chill markets when the CME Group pledged 300 million of its own money to help former MF Global customers get their cash back faster.
[01:03:14.601 --> 01:03:20.585]  The exchange was likely thinking of customers like Kansas cattle rancher Tim
[01:03:23.297 --> 01:03:23.858]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:03:23.898 --> 01:03:27.441]  The CME Group has already kicked in $300 million.
[01:03:27.862 --> 01:03:30.504]  Oh, but it's above $1.2 billion, I'm afraid.
[01:03:30.564 --> 01:03:45.519]  And the CME Group, we've reissued their press releases from a year ago promising that they had all these hundreds of trillions in assets and everything was guaranteed while attacking Gerald Celente and his comments on this show.
[01:03:47.168 --> 01:04:01.534]  Fed up and frustrated with his broker's collapse and what he sees as the CME's slow efforts to help him retrieve his $30,000 in stranded capital, the farmer says his faith in the futures industry has been shaken to its core.
[01:04:02.714 --> 01:04:02.914]  Oh!
[01:04:04.495 --> 01:04:07.416]  I would be hedging some feeder cattle right now.
[01:04:09.434 --> 01:04:10.795]  But I'm not going to do it.
[01:04:11.436 --> 01:04:15.239]  I'm leaving them exposed to the cash market, and I don't like that.
[01:04:15.299 --> 01:04:16.540]  Yeah, that'll drop down prices.
[01:04:17.301 --> 01:04:30.251]  He went on to say, Reitsky may reside far from the trading pit in Chicago, but he and thousands of other ranchers and farmers across the country are at the heart of our futures trading.
[01:04:30.992 --> 01:04:36.257]  With billions of dollars locked up in MF Global's October 31st bankruptcy filing,
[01:04:37.972 --> 01:04:45.155]  They are likely a key voice in determining if and when the futures business remains its poise and reputation.
[01:04:45.175 --> 01:04:45.715]  It's poise.
[01:04:46.075 --> 01:04:47.796]  We'll be right back with Greg Pallast on this.
[01:04:47.816 --> 01:04:50.877]  This affects everything, even if you're not involved in the futures market.
[01:04:51.637 --> 01:04:52.657]  Even if you don't care.
[01:04:52.978 --> 01:04:53.578]  We'll be back.
[01:04:53.638 --> 01:04:56.179]  InfoWars Nightly News coming up tonight, 7 o'clock.
[01:04:56.379 --> 01:04:56.759]  Stay with us.

[01:05:16.834 --> 01:05:19.476]  I know eFoods Direct and they're not full of hype like you.
[01:05:19.737 --> 01:05:24.580]  eFoods Direct goes to great lengths to ensure you get the best ingredients full of nutrition and flavor.
[01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:25.701]  They are the real deal.
[01:05:25.861 --> 01:05:27.462]  Melvin, you're right about one thing though.

[01:05:30.725 --> 01:05:31.385]  We're good to go.
[01:06:04.989 --> 01:06:05.909]  Tyranny is here.
[01:06:06.250 --> 01:06:09.751]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:06:09.771 --> 01:06:12.392]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:06:12.412 --> 01:06:17.854]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:06:18.294 --> 01:06:24.557]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:06:24.957 --> 01:06:30.519]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:06:30.939 --> 01:06:34.621]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:06:35.101 --> 01:06:39.084]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:06:39.385 --> 01:06:44.889]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:06:45.349 --> 01:06:48.311]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:06:48.892 --> 01:06:50.293]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:06:50.873 --> 01:06:51.354]  It's here.

[01:07:01.107 --> 01:07:07.232]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:07:07.772 --> 01:07:12.535]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:07:12.916 --> 01:07:19.701]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:07:21.642 --> 01:07:24.104]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:07:25.705 --> 01:07:27.827]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[01:07:30.117 --> 01:07:33.999]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:07:34.719 --> 01:07:37.820]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[01:07:38.541 --> 01:07:39.361]  Others don't.
[01:07:39.781 --> 01:07:41.662]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:07:41.922 --> 01:07:43.443]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:07:43.723 --> 01:07:46.284]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:07:46.604 --> 01:07:50.646]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[01:07:50.826 --> 01:07:52.847]  So you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:07:53.227 --> 01:07:55.428]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:07:55.928 --> 01:07:57.969]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[01:07:58.289 --> 01:07:59.170]  Others don't.
[01:08:02.048 --> 01:08:04.231]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:04.831 --> 01:08:07.635]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:18.980]  We're good to go.
[01:08:44.895 --> 01:08:48.697]  We've also got some other special reports that'll be airing tomorrow as well.
[01:08:49.217 --> 01:08:52.158]  I want to thank Mike Adams for doing the Nightly News last night.
[01:08:52.498 --> 01:08:59.001]  Also, Rob Dude did a great job, as well as Aaron Dykes and the entire InfoWars.com and Nightly News and Radio crew.
[01:08:59.421 --> 01:09:02.883]  I want to thank our AM and FM affiliates, Global Shortwave and XM.
[01:09:04.133 --> 01:09:07.255]  You, of course, can subscribe to XM Series and listen to us.
[01:09:07.715 --> 01:09:12.077]  We're on different channels on each one, but just go to XM Radio and type in Alex Jones.
[01:09:12.097 --> 01:09:13.077]  You can pull up the channels.
[01:09:13.858 --> 01:09:16.659]  The point is that we're reaching a lot of people.
[01:09:17.139 --> 01:09:20.801]  I also want to thank the Drudge Report for more and more carrying our articles a couple times a week.
[01:09:21.261 --> 01:09:25.603]  They've got one up there today where Paul Watson wrote for InfoWars.com.
[01:09:26.904 --> 01:09:35.428]  Right in the middle of the Drudge Report, the biggest news website in the world, hands down, drives more news traffic than the New York Times and Twitter combined!
[01:09:36.489 --> 01:09:37.089]  And Google!
[01:09:38.230 --> 01:09:38.830]  Gotta love it!
[01:09:38.970 --> 01:09:44.593]  And it's wonderful that Drudge carries a lot of our news and information, so we return the favor right back at him.
[01:09:45.073 --> 01:09:54.398]  If you go over there, and the other great folks that work with him, now we're going to be getting to Palace in a moment, but again, if you go to InfoWars.com,
[01:09:55.765 --> 01:10:14.092]  You can find the story, but if you go to the middle of Drudge, you can see the article where the dreaded secret police that work for the military dictatorship in Egypt, get rid of the old boss, bring in the new boss, even worse, are now saying they're going to call themselves Homeland Security and rationalizing their activities, pointing at U.S.
[01:10:14.152 --> 01:10:16.253]  police and their brutal crackdowns.
[01:10:17.356 --> 01:10:25.000]  On Occupy Wall Street, that is a diverse group, but even if you disagree with Occupy Wall Street, they have a right to protest and demonstrate.
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:43.931]  Now, I'm going to talk to Greg in this segment and the next, but then we're going to take him up to the 51 break where I'm going to take calls, but only on the global derivatives meltdown, only on the brokerage firms, only on Credit Suisse coming out and predicting bank runs and the possible end of the euro.
[01:10:45.399 --> 01:10:47.781]  The destruction of confidence is what we're talking about.
[01:10:47.821 --> 01:10:49.622]  And Gregg Paulus, I'm so glad we've got him.
[01:10:49.662 --> 01:10:53.826]  His new book just debuted last week.
[01:10:53.906 --> 01:10:54.566]  It's amazing.
[01:10:54.606 --> 01:10:55.927]  Shooting up the best-selling list.
[01:10:55.947 --> 01:10:58.749]  We're going to be breaking that down as well before he leaves us.
[01:10:58.769 --> 01:11:05.915]  But he was a former top federal white-collar crime investigator, just like William K. Black, who's in my film Fall of the Republic.
[01:11:06.235 --> 01:11:13.321]  And he said a year and a half ago, he said, this is an order of magnitude, that means ten times bigger, than the biggest SNL scam we've ever seen.
[01:11:13.861 --> 01:11:14.882]  The difference now is,
[01:11:15.811 --> 01:11:19.852]  They're not just selling Ponzi schemes, they're stealing money directly out of the accounts.
[01:11:19.912 --> 01:11:29.755]  So he's a BBC, ABC reporter, best-selling author, multi-times over, former federal investigator, and I'm just lauding our guest because he's predicted everything that's come true.
[01:11:29.795 --> 01:11:31.056]  That's the kind of guest we have on here.
[01:11:31.076 --> 01:11:40.499]  I have an old chapter in my book, Descent into Tyranny, where we, it's a transcript of my interview with him in 2002, looking out into the future with derivatives and breaking down what's now happened.
[01:11:40.879 --> 01:11:50.622]  The model of the global banks imploding third-world countries through fraud, buying off their politicians, going ahead and killing the gooses that lay golden eggs so you control it.
[01:11:50.682 --> 01:11:53.864]  If you kill and eat the goose, you know nobody else is going to get the golden eggs.
[01:11:54.524 --> 01:11:56.605]  So, they're going for red meat, not gold eggs.
[01:11:56.865 --> 01:11:57.865]  They don't want a free market.
[01:11:57.885 --> 01:11:58.785]  They don't want true freedom.
[01:11:58.805 --> 01:11:59.706]  They don't want stability.
[01:12:00.146 --> 01:12:01.666]  And here's Reuters, what we told you about.
[01:12:01.686 --> 01:12:03.167]  I'm going to get Greg Palast's take on this.
[01:12:04.887 --> 01:12:08.949]  Farm belt rage over MF Global could chill markets, and it quotes
[01:12:10.530 --> 01:12:16.114]  All of these farmers and ranchers that bet on the different commodities, because they're experts in it.
[01:12:16.254 --> 01:12:20.917]  And I've got a family that's been involved in cattle futures and corn futures and do pretty good in it.
[01:12:21.337 --> 01:12:24.480]  They're not involved in it now because they know you can get burned.
[01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:30.624]  Even when you've already taken the money, put it in your account, it's your money you even put in in many cases, they're taking
[01:12:31.531 --> 01:12:34.953]  These accounts, and here's the key word, that are segregated.
[01:13:01.651 --> 01:13:09.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, could be the spark that lights off the fireworks factory, as they say.
[01:13:09.220 --> 01:13:13.104]  And joining us to break this down, how big this could be.
[01:13:13.444 --> 01:13:15.387]  You think we're in a depression now, folks?
[01:13:15.907 --> 01:13:19.371]  Why would the banksters destroy confidence like this?
[01:13:19.772 --> 01:13:22.815]  Greg Pallas, who understands their kleptocracy.
[01:13:24.136 --> 01:13:28.237]  They're kleptocratic psychology because he studied them and put a lot of them in jail.
[01:13:28.317 --> 01:13:29.438]  He joins us.
[01:13:30.198 --> 01:13:35.741]  Greg, is this the beginning of a wild orgy of corruption or have we seen the worst?
[01:13:37.489 --> 01:13:41.270]  No, this is the beginning of the exposure of some of the wild orgy of corruption.
[01:13:41.731 --> 01:13:42.311]  It's there.
[01:13:43.071 --> 01:13:52.355]  Okay, let's remember, when you're talking about MF Capital and you're talking about John Corzine, this was the guy who was CEO of Goldman Sachs.
[01:13:52.795 --> 01:13:58.857]  So, in other words, this is the guy that lit the fuse and began the fires that, of course, blew up his company.
[01:13:58.917 --> 01:13:59.738]  Not that he cares.
[01:13:59.798 --> 01:14:02.159]  He was already worth about a quarter billion dollars.
[01:14:02.519 --> 01:14:03.219]  So, if you're
[01:14:03.379 --> 01:14:08.001]  If you're out there, don't wring out your hanky for John Corzine.
[01:14:08.461 --> 01:14:14.785]  You know, just a billion bucks is disappearing, a lot of it farmer's money because it's commodities.
[01:14:15.725 --> 01:14:16.225]  And you're right.
[01:14:16.305 --> 01:14:21.288]  And so what I did in Vulture's Picnic, and by the way, just so you know Alex, one, I want to thank you.
[01:14:21.788 --> 01:14:27.711]  I know they think that the listeners out there in the middle of America are illiterate, but actually,
[01:14:28.711 --> 01:14:33.413]  You put Vulture's Picnic on the Times Best Seller list, Alex, so thank you much.
[01:14:33.674 --> 01:14:37.075]  But I have to change the name from Vulture's Picnic to Job Creator's Picnic.
[01:14:37.095 --> 01:14:38.596]  You know, people like John Corzine, right?
[01:14:39.375 --> 01:14:41.996]  But here's one of the things I uncovered there.
[01:14:42.596 --> 01:15:02.324]  These guys, Goldman and the big banks, were running this scam where they're working with the Euro countries, especially Greece, secretly working with the governments and the central bankers to pull money out of the central banks, to convert the currencies into yens, dollars, move them around, where they were Euros at first,
[01:15:03.044 --> 01:15:09.906]  Put them back in and supposedly these big operators like Goldman were taking billions and billions and billions of dollars of losses.
[01:15:10.246 --> 01:15:12.267]  Well, that's on the cover, on the surface.
[01:15:12.647 --> 01:15:16.989]  And of course, the TARP program, you are now paying for all their losses.
[01:15:17.089 --> 01:15:22.551]  Goldman Sachs was turned into a commercial bank with public guarantees in 24 hours.
[01:15:22.571 --> 01:15:23.271]  This usually takes
[01:15:23.911 --> 01:15:26.833]  Ten years, and you have to show a strong balance sheet.
[01:15:27.073 --> 01:15:30.995]  Goldman Sachs says, we're bankrupt, make us a commercial bank and bail us out.
[01:15:31.035 --> 01:15:32.396]  They do that in 24 hours.
[01:15:32.736 --> 01:15:34.817]  So they're showing losses, but they weren't there.
[01:15:34.877 --> 01:15:35.998]  Those losses weren't there.
[01:15:36.478 --> 01:15:38.779]  They had secret agreements with the Greek government.
[01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:48.265]  They had secret agreements with the Italian and Spanish governments, in which Goldman and the other banks' losses, but particularly Goldman, would be made up
[01:15:49.372 --> 01:15:58.459]  Goldman would be basically paid off secretly, and in addition, Goldman got about $300 million, that's $340 million in fees.
[01:15:58.479 --> 01:16:02.402]  That's about a third of a billion dollars in fees for this scam.
[01:16:02.742 --> 01:16:11.668]  The purpose was, by the way, so that these governments could say that their deficits were less than 3%, which is what they need to be in the Eurozone.
[01:16:11.929 --> 01:16:15.912]  But of course, being in the Eurozone is like, you know, wanting to be in the leper colony.
[01:16:16.832 --> 01:16:17.533]  But nevertheless,
[01:16:18.303 --> 01:16:27.266]  So you have to understand that what's happening in the world financial markets, it would be wrong to think of this as a financial disaster first.
[01:16:27.786 --> 01:16:34.248]  It is a crime scene, and like many crime scenes where there's bleeding bodies, where there's blown up buildings, where there's arson,
[01:16:34.992 --> 01:16:36.312]  And this is financial arson.
[01:16:36.533 --> 01:16:46.536]  Yeah, there's destruction, but it's very, to use the foggy term, financial downturn, big recession, is missing the point.
[01:16:46.776 --> 01:16:51.978]  What we have now is a world, is a finance community, which is a crime scene.
[01:16:52.538 --> 01:16:59.460]  Because, you know, when I was a fraud investigator, I mean, what's strange to me, I don't know what, you know, I mean, I've seen the bottom.
[01:16:59.660 --> 01:17:01.441]  I've seen some pretty bad stuff, Alex.
[01:17:01.541 --> 01:17:03.462]  After all, I did racketeering investigations.
[01:17:05.233 --> 01:17:06.996]  This is the type of stuff we used to cuff people for.
[01:17:07.036 --> 01:17:11.343]  I mean, guys like Corzine, guys like Blank Fine from, uh, uh, Goldman.
[01:17:12.254 --> 01:17:18.478]  When they got caught in the scam, we used to cuff these guys and read them their rights and walk them out of the buildings like Ivan Boesky.
[01:17:18.959 --> 01:17:23.802]  I mean, Boesky was a Girl Scout compared to these guys, and he didn't take down entire nations.
[01:17:23.822 --> 01:17:24.483]  Well, that's the question.
[01:17:24.543 --> 01:17:34.009]  Why did Bernie Madoff go to jail for only 50, 75 million or so, some say 100 million, when these guys are involved in destroying and tying up trillions?
[01:17:35.170 --> 01:17:36.931]  I mean, was he kind of an outside player?
[01:17:36.971 --> 01:17:39.513]  I mean, he was the guy that, you know, came up with the NASDAQ.
[01:17:41.894 --> 01:17:48.018]  Well, let's not forget that Madoff was covering for others like Paulson, okay?
[01:17:48.258 --> 01:17:59.126]  And he had guys, there were investors in Madoff's funds who were earning two and three hundred percent when everyone else was getting hosed because obviously a few billionaires knew.
[01:17:59.666 --> 01:18:02.488]  So either he took the fall for them
[01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:07.032]  Or, basically, the 1% of the 1% was going down.
[01:18:07.492 --> 01:18:08.652]  He was their toy boy.
[01:18:08.692 --> 01:18:09.693]  He was just a tool.
[01:18:10.853 --> 01:18:12.994]  Someone got that money, and take a look.
[01:18:13.115 --> 01:18:14.035]  It wasn't made off.
[01:18:14.075 --> 01:18:15.776]  That money went somewhere.
[01:18:15.816 --> 01:18:17.917]  It didn't just vanish into outer space.
[01:18:17.937 --> 01:18:20.518]  You know, they say they lost some... The money wasn't lost.
[01:18:20.578 --> 01:18:21.899]  Believe me, someone found it.
[01:18:21.939 --> 01:18:22.819]  It went somewhere.
[01:18:23.980 --> 01:18:27.381]  And the guys who got the money are giggling.
[01:18:28.342 --> 01:18:28.882]  Are giggling.
[01:18:29.739 --> 01:18:36.204]  Okay, and there's at least four arbitrageurs, that you could name, who got the money from that scam.
[01:18:36.584 --> 01:18:37.905]  Why aren't they giving it up?
[01:18:37.965 --> 01:18:42.209]  Only one woman... I mean, how much confidence is this going to destroy?
[01:18:45.491 --> 01:18:51.596]  Well, they look at confidence destruction because it creates more of what's called volatility in the markets, which increases the value of derivatives.
[01:18:51.956 --> 01:18:54.598]  So, volatility destruction is part of the game.
[01:18:55.535 --> 01:18:56.236]  That's the problem.
[01:19:08.723 --> 01:19:09.523]  Fire insurance.
[01:19:10.064 --> 01:19:12.725]  But it's like arsonists selling fire insurance.
[01:19:12.925 --> 01:19:14.766]  The banks that are selling it like Goldman's.
[01:19:15.626 --> 01:19:16.986]  So they keep setting fires.
[01:19:17.026 --> 01:19:19.067]  They keep saying, oh, you need fire insurance.
[01:19:19.888 --> 01:19:21.048]  You know how much they're making?
[01:19:21.408 --> 01:19:24.850]  You know that the average Greek family, for example, and that's where it's worse.
[01:19:24.930 --> 01:19:25.890]  But you're getting it, too.
[01:19:26.190 --> 01:19:28.131]  You know, it's coming to L.A., so don't worry.
[01:19:28.231 --> 01:19:29.452]  Just hang on there.
[01:19:29.692 --> 01:19:31.072]  You think you're that far from Athens?
[01:19:31.092 --> 01:19:31.452]  You aren't.
[01:19:31.572 --> 01:19:32.353]  Not financially.
[01:19:33.653 --> 01:19:37.475]  In Athens right now, in Greece, the average family is paying
[01:19:38.035 --> 01:19:39.396]  We're going to go to break.

[01:24:53.561 --> 01:24:57.202]  Greg, going into break, I ask the question, how far will it go?
[01:24:57.342 --> 01:24:59.683]  I understand the command destruction, the volatility.
[01:25:00.083 --> 01:25:03.584]  The insiders like volatility because it's like a rigged casino.
[01:25:03.964 --> 01:25:05.145]  They know what's going to happen.
[01:25:06.025 --> 01:25:11.227]  But at a certain point, we're now getting past, you know, mega-minions, mega-gophers like Madoff.
[01:25:12.245 --> 01:25:20.972]  Up to super minions like Corzine, who then works for the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds, the Dutch Royalty, the British Royalty, the Saudi Royalty, folks like that.
[01:25:21.452 --> 01:25:24.995]  Now we're getting up to the... I mean, are they just going to take everybody's money?
[01:25:25.335 --> 01:25:26.456]  And that's just the way it is?
[01:25:26.556 --> 01:25:28.878]  And I guess Homeland Security's standing by?
[01:25:31.536 --> 01:25:50.258]  Well, I thought that there was kind of a bottom to what these guys would do, but I just, you know, and let me be commercially reminded that my new book is Vulture's Picnic, and if you go to vulturespicnic.org, you can get some of this info, including, by the way, the secret memo between Tim Geithner, Secretary of the Treasury, and
[01:25:50.998 --> 01:25:56.320]  Larry Summers, our economics star, who should be called the typhoid Mary of economics.
[01:25:56.840 --> 01:26:01.902]  I want you to go and see that at vulturespicnic.org and you'll see what's going on.
[01:26:02.262 --> 01:26:03.683]  These guys really have no bottom.
[01:26:03.703 --> 01:26:05.243]  When you look at that, that was a memo.
[01:26:05.543 --> 01:26:15.147]  And by the way, I got that memo verified by the head, the Director General of the World Trade Organization himself, because my position with BBC, I can get to anyone in the world, basically.
[01:26:16.307 --> 01:26:17.588]  And they verified this stuff.
[01:26:18.468 --> 01:26:21.410]  They don't spit these guys without asking the banks.
[01:26:21.450 --> 01:26:24.192]  And there is Corzine's name.
[01:26:24.252 --> 01:26:28.614]  There is no financial international policy made in the United States.
[01:26:29.495 --> 01:26:32.296]  Geithner tells Summers, call Corzine.
[01:26:32.517 --> 01:26:34.998]  This is the guy that just took us down for a billion bucks.
[01:26:35.218 --> 01:26:37.840]  And believe me, he ain't gonna be wearing pinstripes.
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:38.740]  And it ain't happening.
[01:26:39.041 --> 01:26:42.763]  So I thought that there was a bot until I've seen the latest documents, the latest material.
[01:26:43.383 --> 01:26:44.864]  These guys are going for broke.
[01:26:45.064 --> 01:26:46.646]  We go broke, and they clean up.
[01:26:47.026 --> 01:26:55.632]  They set the fire in Greece, and now they're buying up the Greek water systems, the Greek ports, like Thessalonica, you know, like these are famous, you know, old names.
[01:26:56.012 --> 01:26:58.714]  You saw the film 300 or something, you know.
[01:26:59.075 --> 01:27:01.356]  Ancient stuff that they're buying up the beaches, right?
[01:27:01.616 --> 01:27:04.579]  So now they're moving on to Italy, they're moving on to Portugal, Spain.
[01:27:06.158 --> 01:27:10.840]  They're doing this thing all over the world, and of course picking up oil properties absolutely everywhere.
[01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:19.842]  You set the world on fire, you're the last guy standing with the cash, you clean up and pick up everything at the fire sale.
[01:27:20.082 --> 01:27:28.465]  The number one thing that's happening, these so-called austerity programs that are the result of this massive volatility and explosion in cost of derivatives.
[01:27:29.305 --> 01:27:35.188]  The austerity programs begin with privatization, selling off of public properties.
[01:27:36.748 --> 01:27:38.229]  Man, these guys should clean it up.
[01:27:39.550 --> 01:27:41.691]  They're going to be the landlords of the planet.
[01:27:41.751 --> 01:27:42.611]  They'll have everything.
[01:27:42.891 --> 01:27:44.272]  We're just going to be living on their planet.
[01:27:44.312 --> 01:27:44.612]  That's it.
[01:27:46.212 --> 01:27:49.775]  And you can see he's setting up this total police state surveillance grid.
[01:27:49.815 --> 01:27:51.236]  It's standardized worldwide.
[01:27:51.276 --> 01:27:55.019]  And now, Greg, I guess they can't call people like myself a kook.
[01:27:55.039 --> 01:28:11.171]  They admit in Time Magazine, Wall Street Journal, Financial Times of London, London Independent, London Telegraph, oh, it's a banking dictatorship by Goldman Sachs who goes in and takes over governments and takes decades to do it and makes money on the way up with derivatives and makes money on the way down.
[01:28:11.231 --> 01:28:13.412]  And thank God they're there running everything.
[01:28:13.813 --> 01:28:15.494]  It's a global corporate government.
[01:28:16.214 --> 01:28:17.075]  I mean, wow!
[01:28:17.676 --> 01:28:20.278]  And I guess they just think it'll just go on forever, Greg.
[01:28:22.360 --> 01:28:22.501]  Yeah.
[01:28:23.221 --> 01:28:28.787]  I think one of the things that we have to recognize is that, um... Can you hear me?
[01:28:29.047 --> 01:28:29.347]  Yes, sir.
[01:28:29.367 --> 01:28:29.948]  Did I lose you?
[01:28:31.469 --> 01:28:32.070]  Okay, sorry.
[01:28:32.290 --> 01:28:33.131]  I was losing out there.
[01:28:33.291 --> 01:28:33.832]  Hey, that's all right.
[01:28:33.872 --> 01:28:35.713]  Your accent sounds great, my friend.
[01:28:35.754 --> 01:28:36.034]  Go ahead.
[01:28:37.940 --> 01:28:39.502]  Okay, alright, yeah, I came back in to you.
[01:28:40.143 --> 01:28:41.184]  Um, wait, is this?
[01:28:41.504 --> 01:28:42.986]  Can you, I'm sorry, can you hear me now?
[01:28:43.006 --> 01:28:43.626]  I just want to make sure.
[01:28:43.746 --> 01:28:44.527]  Yes, go ahead, Greg.
[01:28:44.947 --> 01:28:45.788]  I lose you, Alex.
[01:28:46.809 --> 01:28:55.058]  Alright, um, what's happened is that the, um, that in the cradle of democracy, Greece
[01:28:55.791 --> 01:29:02.093]  When the President of Greece said, well, we should let the people vote on the bankers' proposal, the U.S.
[01:29:02.373 --> 01:29:06.654]  and international press went completely hog-nuts wild.
[01:29:06.694 --> 01:29:09.314]  How dare you let people vote on the fate of their economy?
[01:29:09.594 --> 01:29:15.336]  And they got rid of the elected president, and they put in a guy who was a Goldman Sachs advisor, completely unelected.
[01:29:15.376 --> 01:29:16.616]  Same thing happened in Italy.
[01:29:16.676 --> 01:29:20.017]  I wasn't a fan of Berlusconi, but at least he was an elected president.
[01:29:20.377 --> 01:29:21.617]  Now you have... Can you imagine?
[01:29:21.637 --> 01:29:23.978]  The bankers are literally picking presidents.
[01:29:24.498 --> 01:29:38.883]  It's a financial coup d'etat, and we're being told that this is a good idea because only the unelected have the guts to tell us that we have to cut, you know, that we have to cut government and cut what we are owed from our pensions.
[01:29:38.903 --> 01:29:40.524]  It's a new type of authoritarianism.
[01:29:40.544 --> 01:29:41.644]  I want you to finish up with that.
[01:29:41.685 --> 01:29:43.225]  Talk about austerity in Greece.
[01:29:43.265 --> 01:29:44.926]  Then we'll go to calls straight ahead.
[01:29:44.946 --> 01:29:45.366]  Stay with us.
[01:29:45.386 --> 01:29:46.946]  Greg Palast is our guest.
[01:29:47.006 --> 01:29:48.307]  His new book, Vulture's Picnic.
[01:29:48.327 --> 01:29:48.667]  Stay with us.
[01:29:50.268 --> 01:29:51.208]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.648 --> 01:29:53.169]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.194 --> 01:29:56.890]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.831 --> 01:30:05.054]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:30:05.374 --> 01:30:05.975]  Number one.
[01:30:06.295 --> 01:30:09.437]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:09.718 --> 01:30:10.278]  Number two.
[01:30:10.578 --> 01:30:15.122]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:15.462 --> 01:30:15.902]  It's true.
[01:30:16.202 --> 01:30:20.766]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:21.086 --> 01:30:21.626]  Number three.
[01:30:21.907 --> 01:30:25.189]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:30:25.489 --> 01:30:29.192]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:30:29.392 --> 01:30:29.932]  Number four.
[01:30:30.192 --> 01:30:32.553]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:30:32.933 --> 01:30:36.335]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:30:36.635 --> 01:30:37.155]  Number five.
[01:30:37.415 --> 01:30:41.337]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:30:41.557 --> 01:30:46.319]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:30:46.619 --> 01:30:50.640]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:50.780 --> 01:30:52.361]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:52.581 --> 01:30:57.183]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[01:30:57.783 --> 01:30:58.003]  877-327-0365.
[01:30:58.444 --> 01:31:03.228]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:31:03.448 --> 01:31:08.472]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:31:08.753 --> 01:31:10.114]  Saving means to make money.
[01:31:10.274 --> 01:31:19.062]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:31:19.802 --> 01:31:26.907]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:31:27.327 --> 01:31:34.952]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:31:35.332 --> 01:31:40.255]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:31:40.575 --> 01:31:42.736]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:31:45.498 --> 01:31:48.401]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[01:31:48.722 --> 01:31:51.024]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:31:51.104 --> 01:31:53.207]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[01:32:01.596 --> 01:32:05.218]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:32:05.618 --> 01:32:08.619]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:32:08.859 --> 01:32:13.621]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:32:13.641 --> 01:32:19.884]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:32:20.044 --> 01:32:22.285]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:32:22.825 --> 01:32:23.105]  Tim Geithner?
[01:32:23.125 --> 01:32:23.546]  Bernanke?
[01:32:23.646 --> 01:32:24.247]  They're arsonists!
[01:32:24.307 --> 01:32:25.568]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:32:25.588 --> 01:32:27.831]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:32:41.727 --> 01:32:48.655]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:32:48.995 --> 01:32:58.125]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:33:08.599 --> 01:33:12.460]  Alex Jones here on the road back in Austin tomorrow.
[01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:14.240]  About to have a marathon drive back.
[01:33:14.300 --> 01:33:25.703]  Greg Pallast, former and federal organized crime racketeering investigator, turned journalist with BBC, ABC News, best-selling author, joins us.
[01:33:25.783 --> 01:33:37.165]  And don't forget right now, they're trying to blame us for the guy that shot up the White House, who's a schizophrenic who thinks he's the Christ, reportedly, because he supposedly watched the Obama deception a year ago at the party.
[01:33:37.805 --> 01:33:40.346]  So, we gotta restrict that free speech, boy, let me tell ya.
[01:33:40.766 --> 01:33:50.968]  Be sure and get that film out to everybody as well, because it doesn't really... It gets into Obama, but it shows how he's just a teleprompter reader for the big mega-banks and derivatives kingpins bankrupting the planet.
[01:33:51.008 --> 01:34:00.711]  Now, I'm gonna go to your calls, Frank, Kyle, Lennon, Craig, Tom, and others, here in just a moment, but let me just go back to what Greg's saying and give him about five minutes of the floor to really flesh this out.
[01:34:01.791 --> 01:34:05.312]  Understand, I have heard Bloomberg Radio
[01:34:06.352 --> 01:34:15.217]  I have heard, you name it, CNBC, I say heard because I listen to them on XM, I don't watch a bunch of TV, but I listen to TV on radio.
[01:34:16.178 --> 01:34:26.284]  I have heard them all in the last few months demonize freedom, demonize people being able to vote anywhere in Europe, demonize the Germans who might not want to go along with bankrolling all of this.
[01:34:27.839 --> 01:34:34.726]  I've seen them demonize, and I've heard them with assurance say, don't worry, they'll do the right thing with the European bureaucracy.
[01:34:34.786 --> 01:34:37.729]  It's got expert, you know, bankers in there from Goldman Sachs.
[01:34:37.769 --> 01:34:51.742]  They know what to do, and they sell it like Europe's falling apart because none of them ever work, and they're lazy idiots, and they're all just sitting around drinking coffee all day, or, you know, sopping up olive oil on their, you know, baguettes.
[01:34:52.363 --> 01:34:54.884]  These people, they're not doing anything.
[01:34:54.904 --> 01:34:55.925]  Yeah, look at Europe, folks.
[01:34:55.985 --> 01:34:56.885]  Look at the production.
[01:34:56.925 --> 01:34:57.605]  Look what they built.
[01:34:57.826 --> 01:34:59.807]  That's a lie, okay?
[01:35:00.127 --> 01:35:00.887]  That's a lie.
[01:35:01.187 --> 01:35:03.748]  So continuing, I've done the math, but they've admitted this.
[01:35:04.169 --> 01:35:09.571]  Iceland, 91% of the debt not owed by the people.
[01:35:09.831 --> 01:35:11.992]  They said no for over a year, finally got the documents.
[01:35:12.613 --> 01:35:19.136]  Turned out it was all basically the bank's own debt that they've gotten their own operatives in government to sign on to.
[01:35:19.676 --> 01:35:20.576]  Same thing in Ireland.
[01:35:20.636 --> 01:35:21.437]  Same thing in Greece.
[01:35:22.213 --> 01:35:39.277]  And it's so over the top that the criminals that engineered the derivative fraud get the governments to sign on to it and then spin-golly it that, oh, this is because you've got, you know, too many weeks off a year and because your social security's too big.
[01:35:39.677 --> 01:35:49.439]  I've always been against big government because then they hold people hostage for the benefits and steal most of it, but then people still back the stealing because they've been made dependent.
[01:35:49.819 --> 01:35:51.219]  That's why I've always been against it.
[01:35:51.479 --> 01:35:57.424]  But the point is, tens of trillions of taxpayer money backing up these derivatives in bailouts.
[01:35:57.664 --> 01:35:59.065]  You never hear that discussed.
[01:35:59.486 --> 01:36:05.591]  All you hear about the fake neocons is how this is great free market and anybody that doesn't like the bailouts is a commie.
[01:36:05.891 --> 01:36:14.078]  No, no, the fascistic groups are up there using the public's wealth and fake privatization pushed by fake libertarians.
[01:36:14.338 --> 01:36:19.623]  It's not privatization to hand roads over for nothing to a foreign corporation like Centra.
[01:36:20.083 --> 01:36:21.064]  We're good to go.
[01:36:42.310 --> 01:36:49.241]  Okay, well, we saw it in Argentina, and by the way, I checked the inside documents I got from the IMF and the World Bank, worked with the big banks.
[01:36:49.301 --> 01:36:55.210]  I checked it with Joe Stiglitz, who won the Nobel Prize in Economics and was the chief economist at the World Bank.
[01:36:55.571 --> 01:36:56.873]  He's got to come out of the cold.
[01:36:57.393 --> 01:36:58.013]  He verified.
[01:36:58.053 --> 01:36:58.633]  This stuff is real.
[01:36:58.673 --> 01:37:06.815]  They had planned in that there was going to be, that they were going to squeeze down the people, take away, as you say, their benefits and, you know, kick up the price of food.
[01:37:07.335 --> 01:37:09.315]  And we ended up with riots in Argentina.
[01:37:09.895 --> 01:37:12.416]  The riots allowed for a repression.
[01:37:12.496 --> 01:37:13.236]  That's what they want.
[01:37:13.256 --> 01:37:15.236]  They want the riots so the tanks can roll.
[01:37:15.296 --> 01:37:16.657]  It's in the plan.
[01:37:16.757 --> 01:37:19.217]  And when I say that, I don't say that stuff lightly, Alex.
[01:37:19.617 --> 01:37:22.158]  I put this stuff at the top of the BBC nightly news.
[01:37:22.598 --> 01:37:24.178]  They're very, very cautious.
[01:37:25.578 --> 01:37:27.580]  Yeah, they write the riot into the document.
[01:37:27.700 --> 01:37:29.381]  Joe Stiglitz called it the IMF riot.
[01:37:30.022 --> 01:37:31.463]  And he said it was right there.
[01:37:31.483 --> 01:37:35.927]  Because they want that riot, so then they bring in the tanks and then they impose this so-called austerity.
[01:37:35.967 --> 01:37:36.807]  What does austerity mean?
[01:37:37.128 --> 01:37:40.570]  It means they cut all your government benefits, they take the money out of your pension funds.
[01:37:41.031 --> 01:37:43.633]  This is not about whether you think government pension funds are a good idea.
[01:37:43.693 --> 01:37:44.814]  This is about looting them.
[01:37:45.194 --> 01:37:47.356]  Whether it's good or bad, they get looted.
[01:37:47.436 --> 01:37:48.737]  Let's keep in mind what this is about.
[01:37:49.838 --> 01:37:49.978]  Yeah.
[01:38:11.380 --> 01:38:13.962]  Yeah, so then what they did, they started selling off everything in sight.
[01:38:13.982 --> 01:38:17.845]  They had a state oil company, which is bought by the Spaniards, Repsol.
[01:38:18.126 --> 01:38:29.555]  Now, we did a calculation with some other economists, and if the Argentine government had never been forced to basically give away their massive oil fields and oil company,
[01:38:29.935 --> 01:38:33.939]  They would right now have no debt at all.
[01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:44.630]  But instead they were gun to their head, they gave up the oil company, they sold the water system to Enron.
[01:38:44.750 --> 01:38:45.992]  Enron had a water unit.
[01:38:46.232 --> 01:38:49.235]  And of course the first thing Enron did was jack up water prices 400%.
[01:38:50.436 --> 01:38:51.597]  And then there was no water!
[01:38:51.877 --> 01:38:55.959]  And then, of course, Enron evaporates with the water money, of course.
[01:38:56.459 --> 01:38:57.940]  That's the game that's being played.
[01:38:58.340 --> 01:38:58.981]  They ruined us.
[01:38:59.041 --> 01:39:00.622]  There were doctors.
[01:39:00.962 --> 01:39:03.323]  I was getting calls from Argentina.
[01:39:03.804 --> 01:39:09.327]  I knew some doctors and teachers who were hunting in the alleys in garbage cans looking for food.
[01:39:09.647 --> 01:39:11.648]  Until they said, enough!
[01:39:11.948 --> 01:39:13.109]  And the people stood up.
[01:39:13.769 --> 01:39:21.371]  And democratically elected leader, we saw this in Ecuador where they were ruined and the Indians came out of the hills burning the towns, starving!
[01:39:21.831 --> 01:39:22.351]  Starving!
[01:39:22.671 --> 01:39:41.775]  And in Ecuador, in Brazil, in Argentina, they said enough, they elected officials who just told these financial jackals, you may not operate here, stick your so-called debts and get out of here, and they reversed the privatizations, they took back their own oil companies, kept the wealth for themselves, and now
[01:39:42.495 --> 01:39:46.920]  Brazil, Ecuador, Argentina, these are the economies that are growing at 8% a year.
[01:39:46.980 --> 01:39:50.103]  These economies are booming because they told the jackals to get the hell out.
[01:39:50.464 --> 01:40:01.055]  And I've got to tell you, in Brazil, I've got a document from the European community, endorsed by our Secretary of State.
[01:40:01.696 --> 01:40:06.538]  Which is a plan to destroy the Brazilian economy through a trade war.
[01:40:06.778 --> 01:40:11.480]  Because Brazil refuses to accept derivatives trades from J.P.
[01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:11.881]  Morgan.
[01:40:12.201 --> 01:40:12.521]  J.P.
[01:40:12.561 --> 01:40:14.842]  Morgan wants to operate in Brazil.
[01:40:15.342 --> 01:40:18.444]  The Brazilian government said, we don't allow toxic financial assets.
[01:40:18.484 --> 01:40:20.364]  We don't allow gambling with banking money.
[01:40:20.945 --> 01:40:23.566]  And the US and the European community have now said, well, you know what?
[01:40:23.746 --> 01:40:34.050]  If you don't let in these bankers with their toxic assets, if you don't decriminalize your banking system like we've done, we're not going to buy your orange juice, we're not going to buy your ethanol, we're going to just wipe you out.
[01:40:34.390 --> 01:40:36.591]  And I have to say that Brazil stood strong on this.
[01:40:36.631 --> 01:40:40.953]  They said, you know what, go ahead, make our day.
[01:40:41.353 --> 01:40:47.916]  And they have been growing at 8% a year, they are booming, and they just say, you know,
[01:40:49.156 --> 01:40:54.019]  We're not inviting, we're not inviting disease in here, including financial diseases.
[01:40:54.499 --> 01:40:57.161]  You know, and that's, but now in Europe, they're not doing that.
[01:40:57.461 --> 01:41:15.192]  They're letting the, if you read Vulture's Picnic, the chapter called The Generalism of Globalization, you can see, in fact, at vulturespicnic.org, you can see a little film called The Generalism of Globalization, where I'm in the room with the head of WTO, and we're going over these documents, these inside documents, and he is saying, well, yeah, he's trying to explain them away, of course.
[01:41:15.212 --> 01:41:17.634]  There's always an explanation, Alex, there's always an explanation.
[01:41:18.654 --> 01:41:22.595]  The Frenchman is sitting there going, we are not the evil cabal of bankers.
[01:41:22.635 --> 01:41:24.896]  Well, he's head of Credit Lyonnais, the biggest French bank.
[01:41:25.596 --> 01:41:29.197]  Not a cabal, but they're just secretly meeting and burning down the world for us.
[01:41:29.737 --> 01:41:31.537]  In Europe, the people are not standing up.
[01:41:32.218 --> 01:41:35.038]  Each of these nations has two political major parties.
[01:41:35.518 --> 01:41:38.419]  The Socialist Party, the Christian Democratic Party of each nation.
[01:41:38.699 --> 01:41:40.300]  They're all hand-in-hand.
[01:41:40.460 --> 01:41:45.541]  You can't stick a dime between these two parties, and they're all completely mobbed up.
[01:41:46.041 --> 01:41:47.362]  With the banks like Goldman.
[01:41:47.382 --> 01:41:51.565]  You know, both Greek parties conducted this fraud with Goldman Sachs.
[01:41:51.725 --> 01:41:52.326]  Both of them.
[01:41:52.586 --> 01:41:53.927]  They're both dirty on this.
[01:41:54.267 --> 01:42:03.595]  So when it came up for, when there was a panic that the, God forbid, the Greek people should be allowed to vote in the cradle of democracy, the two parties which are involved in the fraud
[01:42:04.531 --> 01:42:06.534]  He said, no, no, no vote.
[01:42:06.795 --> 01:42:09.439]  We're just going to pick this Goldman consultant to be the president.
[01:42:09.919 --> 01:42:11.422]  The guy doesn't even live in Greece.
[01:42:11.702 --> 01:42:12.644]  He's from the States.
[01:42:12.684 --> 01:42:13.565]  He's an American, you know?
[01:42:13.705 --> 01:42:14.867]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:42:15.107 --> 01:42:17.030]  And I don't care if he's American or Greek or whatever.
[01:42:18.032 --> 01:42:18.793]  He's a banker.
[01:42:19.696 --> 01:42:20.596]  And he's not elected.
[01:42:21.097 --> 01:42:23.137]  And you know, they fear democracy.
[01:42:23.157 --> 01:42:28.760]  But I'm telling you that what happened, if you read Vulture's Picnic, and I met with the President of Ecuador about this.
[01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:30.340]  He's an economist, by the way.
[01:42:30.380 --> 01:42:31.401]  He taught at the University of Illinois.
[01:42:31.441 --> 01:42:34.882]  He said, I'm not going to let these jackals rip our country apart.
[01:42:36.062 --> 01:42:37.763]  I showed him the documents from the IMF.
[01:42:37.803 --> 01:42:39.364]  He said, I thought this was happening.
[01:42:39.504 --> 01:42:41.125]  I thought there was a conspiracy.
[01:42:41.266 --> 01:42:41.826]  Here it is.
[01:42:42.266 --> 01:42:44.587]  He made those documents public in Ecuador.
[01:42:44.928 --> 01:42:48.050]  Our State Department went completely wild over him doing that.
[01:42:48.350 --> 01:42:49.050]  But he said, you know what?
[01:42:49.490 --> 01:42:50.471]  I see the documents now.
[01:42:50.971 --> 01:42:53.593]  You guys take your bankers and go fly.
[01:42:53.653 --> 01:42:55.474]  And his economy is soaring.
[01:42:55.754 --> 01:42:57.095]  Okay, we're just right there, Greg.
[01:42:57.215 --> 01:43:03.438]  Incredible info, and I want to go to callers, but obviously we're going to have to get you back up in the next week or two, because there's so much to cover.
[01:43:03.538 --> 01:43:10.442]  And I want to get into how we beat these people, perhaps as we take a few calls, and where you see things going, and we don't stand up against them.
[01:43:10.982 --> 01:43:20.828]  But, going back to what you just pointed out, to hear so-called media in the United States, especially the financial news, actually
[01:43:21.812 --> 01:43:34.275]  Demonizing anybody who is for the people running their own governments and admitting it's a new government where bankers are appointed over your country, and then now it's not even an issue.
[01:43:34.795 --> 01:43:38.576]  That shows you what they want to set up here with the super committees and everything else.
[01:43:39.496 --> 01:43:44.617]  It is 100% pure confirmation of just how dangerous this system is, Greg.
[01:43:46.417 --> 01:43:47.879]  Yeah, where's the super committee in the Constitution?
[01:43:47.899 --> 01:43:49.441]  I thought we were supposed to elect our Congress.
[01:43:50.101 --> 01:43:52.124]  I mean, I didn't vote for no super committee, did you?
[01:43:52.144 --> 01:43:53.305]  I don't remember them on the ballot.
[01:43:53.566 --> 01:44:01.916]  I mean, what is this new thing that now, let's turn over, we're now going to be turning over our finances to unelected committees,
[01:44:02.296 --> 01:44:06.780]  You know, it's deeply dangerous.
[01:44:07.361 --> 01:44:10.344]  It's deeply dangerous and it's financially destructive.
[01:44:10.604 --> 01:44:17.050]  The nations which chose democracy in Latin America are financially, economically soaring.
[01:44:17.330 --> 01:44:21.074]  The nations which have chose the bankers' dictatorship are dying!
[01:44:22.239 --> 01:44:23.940]  Briefly just interjecting because I want to go to calls here.
[01:44:23.960 --> 01:44:24.781]  Skype's breaking up a bit.
[01:44:25.282 --> 01:44:27.423]  The issue is, this is in our face.
[01:44:27.804 --> 01:44:33.568]  The Constitution says bills come out of the House, introduced by individual members, and they go through a committee process.
[01:44:33.969 --> 01:44:37.712]  Now they take six House, six Senate, and the President and say, we don't need that.
[01:44:37.732 --> 01:44:39.753]  And now they're going to run the Farm Bill.
[01:44:39.793 --> 01:44:43.917]  And now they've got the Pentagon and Homeland Security running the Rural Affairs.
[01:44:43.997 --> 01:44:47.960]  And now there's suddenly federal police everywhere running the Occupy Attacks.
[01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:52.705]  Let's go to calls, but I want to get your take after that on those subjects.
[01:44:52.765 --> 01:44:54.687]  Greg Powell, investigative journalist, is our guest.
[01:44:55.068 --> 01:44:56.950]  Frank in Canada, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:44:58.084 --> 01:44:59.044]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.
[01:44:59.084 --> 01:45:00.805]  Just two questions, if I may, please.
[01:45:01.445 --> 01:45:07.367]  First of all, with regards to the markets, I mean, the markets are predicated on a certain amount of stability.
[01:45:07.728 --> 01:45:21.913]  And if we've taken a look at, you know, the artificially low interest rates and quantitative easing as a kind of artificial way to prop up the markets, then wouldn't this be counter to that top 1% that owns 80% of the wealth and assets in the markets?
[01:45:21.953 --> 01:45:25.554]  Would this not serve, basically counterproductive to their interests?
[01:45:27.392 --> 01:45:37.982]  The quantitative easing in to prop up the general market so they can control the ups and downs and siphon off money because they're involved in total insider accounting level fraud.
[01:45:38.022 --> 01:45:39.043]  It's total insider.
[01:45:39.063 --> 01:45:40.164]  It's beyond insider.
[01:45:40.525 --> 01:45:41.526]  Greg, do you concur with that?
[01:45:43.496 --> 01:45:47.638]  Well yeah, I mean, take a look at when you talk about the very low interest rates.
[01:45:47.938 --> 01:45:50.019]  That's what they're borrowing at, not what we're borrowing at.
[01:45:50.360 --> 01:45:57.703]  They are borrowing at the Fed window, in some cases at actually negative interest rates, but roughly, normally about a quarter percent interest is what the big banks are paying.
[01:45:57.723 --> 01:46:00.025]  Quarter percent, basically nothing, and then they are...
[01:46:01.105 --> 01:46:02.026]  Lending to us.
[01:46:02.446 --> 01:46:03.948]  Look at your credit card rates.
[01:46:03.988 --> 01:46:05.329]  You're at 29% in some cases.
[01:46:05.629 --> 01:46:08.331]  Look at what they're charging the European Union.
[01:46:08.451 --> 01:46:11.334]  They're charging Italy, like, 9% interest.
[01:46:11.914 --> 01:46:13.896]  And they're getting it at a quarter percent interest.
[01:46:14.236 --> 01:46:16.098]  The spread is insane.
[01:46:16.678 --> 01:46:20.462]  And Greg, look at how they're moving to get rid of our credit rating.
[01:46:21.402 --> 01:46:23.784]  You know, Geithner-Singham never happened, knowing they were planning it.
[01:46:24.065 --> 01:46:27.928]  They're maneuvering us, just like a third world country, into complete receivership.
[01:46:30.401 --> 01:46:40.345]  Well yeah, and what's happening is that we have to, so we are lending them money at a quarter percent and then we're borrowing it back at massive interest rates.
[01:46:40.365 --> 01:46:44.726]  I mean, keep in mind that the banks today are holding a trillion and a half, U.S.
[01:46:44.746 --> 01:46:47.948]  banks are holding more than a trillion and a half dollars in cash assets.
[01:46:48.328 --> 01:46:49.548]  What the heck is going on?
[01:46:49.808 --> 01:46:50.529]  That's our money!
[01:46:50.549 --> 01:46:54.850]  We guarantee their fiat currency that they loan it back to us at interest.
[01:46:55.130 --> 01:46:56.751]  Frank, does that answer your question or what's your other one?
[01:46:57.367 --> 01:46:58.308]  It does, thank you.
[01:46:58.328 --> 01:47:00.049]  And another question for both you gentlemen, please.
[01:47:00.610 --> 01:47:12.420]  With regards to the Occupy movement, no matter what we may think about that, on its effectiveness or not, Mr. Salente, you know, alluded to something a few days ago, which I think, you know, may be a way of looking at this.
[01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:26.071]  He was talking about the idea of a boycott, that if we just buy local, or in fact, in many cases, not support the system by either, A, withdrawing our funds from the economic system... Yeah, that's what Catherine Austin Fitts says.
[01:47:26.820 --> 01:47:31.622]  Yeah, just buying staples and then taking the money out of the financial system the way we know it.
[01:47:32.203 --> 01:47:37.045]  I mean, that would cause these so-called elites a lot of infighting, wouldn't you gentlemen agree?
[01:47:37.085 --> 01:47:40.667]  Let me briefly get solution ideas from Greg, and we'll go to Kyle and others quickly.
[01:47:41.147 --> 01:47:46.990]  Quickly, what are solutions, and particularly, how about this true local sustainability?
[01:47:47.331 --> 01:47:50.712]  I mean, it's not even so much a solution, it's a survival tactic.
[01:47:50.752 --> 01:47:51.773]  We're going to have to do this.
[01:47:53.979 --> 01:48:01.527]  Well, I think the first simple step is most of America and places like Texas, California, New York have community credit unions.
[01:48:01.567 --> 01:48:06.793]  These are not-for-profit banks that by law must loan all their money into the community.
[01:48:07.294 --> 01:48:07.994]  Move your money there.
[01:48:08.014 --> 01:48:10.897]  Don't feed the snakes that bite you.
[01:48:10.918 --> 01:48:12.079]  I have my money at the
[01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:26.700]  The New York Community Credit Union, Lower East Side People's Federal, they were the ones that, by the way, are Occupy Wall Street's banker, and they're the ones that Goldman Sachs is trying to shut down because they're... So that's the interesting thing.
[01:48:27.040 --> 01:48:28.222]  These guys like Goldman.
[01:48:29.043 --> 01:48:36.909]  And Capital One has gone on a warpath against the community credit unions, which means that they're probably a very good idea, a good place to put your money.
[01:48:37.229 --> 01:48:41.933]  They're safe and they're insured, and they loan into the community.
[01:48:42.193 --> 01:48:44.935]  They do not do their bar prohibitively.
[01:48:45.015 --> 01:48:51.180]  Instead of just being even in local banks, I'm going to move mainly into credit unions with the InfoWars piggy bank.
[01:48:51.460 --> 01:48:52.041]  Thank you, Frank.
[01:48:52.061 --> 01:48:53.041]  Kyle in Oregon.
[01:48:53.082 --> 01:48:53.622]  Quick question.
[01:48:53.642 --> 01:48:54.202]  Go ahead, Kyle.
[01:48:54.242 --> 01:48:54.783]  Thanks for calling.
[01:48:58.922 --> 01:49:01.385]  Sounds like somebody's vacuuming or something, Kyle.
[01:49:02.326 --> 01:49:03.767]  Put Kyle on hold and go back to him.
[01:49:04.408 --> 01:49:04.688]  Hey, Alex!
[01:49:04.808 --> 01:49:05.369]  Alex, Alex!
[01:49:05.409 --> 01:49:06.009]  Okay, go ahead, Kyle.
[01:49:06.029 --> 01:49:07.531]  I apologize.
[01:49:07.991 --> 01:49:09.133]  Yeah, you gotta turn your radio off.
[01:49:09.153 --> 01:49:11.395]  So much to inquire you for, so much to relay to you.
[01:49:11.415 --> 01:49:18.822]  In terms of the biggest threat, you know, to our children, outside of them being a walking dead,
[01:49:19.679 --> 01:49:20.681]  About the vaccines.
[01:49:21.161 --> 01:49:22.784]  You know, that's my biggest question for you.
[01:49:22.804 --> 01:49:25.147]  A lot of my family... I'm gonna have to put you on hold.
[01:49:25.167 --> 01:49:26.889]  We're taking financial questions right now, Kyle.
[01:49:26.929 --> 01:49:28.932]  We'll come back to you in a minute after Greg's gone.
[01:49:28.972 --> 01:49:29.773]  Lennon in Oregon.
[01:49:29.814 --> 01:49:30.575]  Lennon, you're on the air.
[01:49:33.238 --> 01:49:34.280]  Hi, uh, Alex.
[01:49:34.921 --> 01:49:35.281]  Yes, sir.
[01:49:36.246 --> 01:49:36.766]  Yes, hi.
[01:49:37.687 --> 01:49:39.528]  I would like to first thank you, gentlemen.
[01:49:40.068 --> 01:49:42.570]  You're two of the best investigative journalists ever.
[01:49:43.730 --> 01:49:45.752]  I'm going to ask my question.
[01:49:45.772 --> 01:49:48.733]  I'd like to just add a comment.
[01:49:48.993 --> 01:49:50.614]  Go ahead.
[01:49:50.794 --> 01:49:53.696]  Off that first question about the interest rates.
[01:49:54.477 --> 01:49:55.717]  This is a corporate takeover.
[01:49:55.757 --> 01:50:00.840]  There's no other reason for the destabilizing of governments and nation states.
[01:50:01.381 --> 01:50:02.861]  Corporations are taking over.
[01:50:02.881 --> 01:50:05.363]  They're doing it by decreasing the interest rate.
[01:50:06.351 --> 01:50:10.838]  Ranky's decreasing the value of the dollar to increase exports.
[01:50:10.858 --> 01:50:11.479]  That's what he says.
[01:50:11.519 --> 01:50:12.941]  Of course, we have no exports.
[01:50:13.822 --> 01:50:14.984]  You know, NAFTA did away with that.
[01:50:15.004 --> 01:50:15.725]  You guys know that.
[01:50:16.386 --> 01:50:19.331]  They're taking this system down pillar by pillar.
[01:50:20.232 --> 01:50:20.613]  Excuse me.
[01:50:22.266 --> 01:50:24.227]  They're killing two birds with one stone.
[01:50:24.567 --> 01:50:28.410]  They're consolidating power slowly and in the cover of darkness.
[01:50:28.430 --> 01:50:30.631]  This MF Global reminds me of Lehman.
[01:50:31.091 --> 01:50:32.752]  This time it's the hedge fund collapse.
[01:50:32.813 --> 01:50:34.914]  Look for Jeffries and BlackRock.
[01:50:34.934 --> 01:50:36.415]  I totally agree with you.
[01:50:36.455 --> 01:50:39.097]  What's your question for Greg so he can answer it when we come back from break?
[01:50:39.637 --> 01:50:41.038]  It's a very broad question.
[01:50:41.058 --> 01:50:42.719]  Mr. Paulist, where are we going?
[01:50:42.759 --> 01:50:46.662]  More specifically, what will finance and the economy look like in the future?
[01:50:47.580 --> 01:50:52.926]  Well, that depends on if these people win, but yeah, let's look to the future with Greg Powell straight ahead.
[01:50:52.946 --> 01:50:56.911]  Hopefully, I'll give him a little bit in the next hour, at least five minutes ahead of Gary Franci joining us.
[01:50:57.232 --> 01:50:57.612]  Stay with us.
[01:50:57.632 --> 01:51:00.555]  We'll be right back.
[01:51:02.958 --> 01:51:06.683]  From the shattered rust belt come the Lost Vegas.
[01:51:08.083 --> 01:51:10.285]  How does it feel to be one of the beautiful people?
[01:51:39.696 --> 01:51:48.826]  Life Before the Collapse by The Lost Vegas on 180 gram vinyl and mastered especially for vinyl by legendary audio engineer Steve Hall.
[01:51:53.310 --> 01:51:56.934]  Life Before the Collapse by The Lost Vegas.
[01:51:56.954 --> 01:52:00.298]  Now available at Amazon.com and iTunes.
[01:52:00.678 --> 01:52:04.719]  You don't need me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis.
[01:52:05.119 --> 01:52:06.359]  Everyone can feel it.
[01:52:06.619 --> 01:52:15.061]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[01:52:15.521 --> 01:52:18.682]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising.
[01:52:18.942 --> 01:52:19.842]  But take heart.
[01:52:19.962 --> 01:52:23.503]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[01:52:23.783 --> 01:52:28.764]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war.
[01:52:29.184 --> 01:52:32.726]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[01:52:33.026 --> 01:52:34.487]  The globalists are scared.
[01:52:34.748 --> 01:52:35.748]  They've overreached.
[01:52:36.088 --> 01:52:39.230]  The future of the info war is in your hands.

[01:52:51.758 --> 01:53:04.142]  If you're a man over 40, you may feel like half the man you used to be.
[01:53:04.382 --> 01:53:05.703]  Are you gaining more body fat?
[01:53:05.963 --> 01:53:07.083]  Are you feeling tired?
[01:53:07.303 --> 01:53:08.904]  Are you losing your sex drive?
[01:53:09.284 --> 01:53:10.184]  It's not your fault.
[01:53:10.384 --> 01:53:13.285]  After 40, your body's testosterone may start dropping.
[01:53:13.445 --> 01:53:15.326]  And if you're an African-American man,
[01:53:15.586 --> 01:53:19.210]  You're at a higher risk of your testosterone turning into estrogen.
[01:53:19.470 --> 01:53:20.811]  Be the man you used to be.

[01:53:42.972 --> 01:53:45.254]  With Ageless Male, you can raise your testosterone naturally by 61%.

[01:53:45.615 --> 01:53:45.955]  That's 1-800-497-8345.
[01:54:07.749 --> 01:54:11.613]  Okay, folks, it's Alex Jones joining you from southern Utah.
[01:54:11.653 --> 01:54:13.035]  Big sky country.
[01:54:13.115 --> 01:54:13.856]  It's so gorgeous.
[01:54:14.336 --> 01:54:15.437]  I love this republic.
[01:54:15.477 --> 01:54:24.786]  No wonder the globalists want to bankrupt it and steal all the private property, raise property taxes, and siphon that out through county and city investments to be stolen by the globalists.
[01:54:25.167 --> 01:54:27.329]  Greg Palast is our guest in this little five-minute segment.
[01:54:27.329 --> 01:54:27.669]  We're good to go.
[01:54:47.638 --> 01:54:57.054]  A, if we're able to just imprison these guys and turn this around, or B, if they just have their way and keep driving forward, or is it going to be a mix of the two?
[01:54:57.094 --> 01:55:00.841]  I mean, is Argentina the type of situation we're looking at?
[01:55:03.487 --> 01:55:04.929]  Well, it's kind of up to us.
[01:55:05.049 --> 01:55:08.513]  In the case of Argentina, things hit rock bottom as they did in Ecuador.
[01:55:08.553 --> 01:55:11.376]  People, you know, like I say, teachers eating out of garbage cans.
[01:55:11.777 --> 01:55:17.763]  So people went into the streets banging pots and pans and saying that they weren't going to work, it's all done, they have to eat.
[01:55:18.304 --> 01:55:20.627]  And democracy took over and the economy soared.
[01:55:20.907 --> 01:55:23.170]  They told the banks to go buzz off and that's that.
[01:55:23.590 --> 01:55:31.939]  I mean, and the guy who's screaming about it, by the way, the number one, you know, in my book, Vulture's Picnic, the number one vulture financier in America is a guy named Paul Singer.
[01:55:32.479 --> 01:55:36.103]  By the way, he was just named as Mitt Romney's top economic advisor.
[01:55:36.123 --> 01:55:37.445]  Uh, hello!
[01:55:37.805 --> 01:55:45.153]  So, what's gonna happen, and that doesn't mean that Obama's gonna be a better choice, because his top economic advisor is Robert Rubin, you know, of Citibank and share...
[01:55:47.472 --> 01:55:48.453]  They got both parties.
[01:55:48.673 --> 01:55:52.277]  I just wanted to make it official and tell you it's official now.
[01:55:52.657 --> 01:56:02.487]  The Uber vulture who is screaming bloody murder about Argentina, telling the banks, telling him to take his bonds and fly with them, the vulture.
[01:56:03.007 --> 01:56:06.969]  Ecuador did the same thing, and you know, because democracy took hold.
[01:56:07.249 --> 01:56:08.409]  It was pretty painful.
[01:56:08.489 --> 01:56:10.790]  People went into the streets and were burning down the Capitol.
[01:56:11.050 --> 01:56:12.411]  The Indians came out of the mountains.
[01:56:12.971 --> 01:56:15.332]  But they said, we're going to vote our way to freedom.
[01:56:15.732 --> 01:56:21.214]  We're not going to, you know, we're not going to say, oh, we'll just turn over the banks because we know how difficult it is.
[01:56:21.834 --> 01:56:22.835]  We are out of control.
[01:56:22.875 --> 01:56:25.676]  We spend too much money, and the money really should go to the bankers.
[01:56:26.436 --> 01:56:28.037]  But unfortunately, I've seen Europe
[01:56:28.593 --> 01:56:32.076]  There seems to be no organized dissenting force.
[01:56:32.557 --> 01:56:34.098]  And so where does America stand?
[01:56:34.159 --> 01:56:38.122]  Are we going to be... Well, I mean, Greg, maybe this is good.
[01:56:39.644 --> 01:56:47.271]  Maybe this is good to let them go all the way and really show people what gangster globalist tyranny is before people finally wake up.
[01:56:47.291 --> 01:56:48.292]  We'll take another call here.
[01:56:48.993 --> 01:56:50.294]  Craig in Connecticut.
[01:56:50.314 --> 01:56:51.395]  You're on the air with Greg Palast.
[01:56:51.415 --> 01:56:51.916]  Go ahead, Craig.
[01:56:52.728 --> 01:56:53.669]  Great, thanks Alex.
[01:56:54.509 --> 01:56:55.310]  Hi Greg, how are you?
[01:56:55.730 --> 01:56:56.651]  Quick question for you.
[01:56:57.531 --> 01:57:02.755]  You've been doing a lot of analogies to the case with Madoff to MF Global.
[01:57:03.055 --> 01:57:18.547]  I think one key difference that I'm seeing right now is that the trustee, Irving Picard, for the bankruptcy with Madoff, he's been doing a phenomenal job in tracing the assets, where they went, clawing them back from people who had the sweetheart deals.
[01:57:19.347 --> 01:57:22.188]  Do you guys have any insight in terms of the trustee that's here?
[01:57:22.228 --> 01:57:23.068]  Is he a globalist?
[01:57:23.188 --> 01:57:24.588]  Is the trustee to be trusted?
[01:57:24.608 --> 01:57:35.611]  You know, if... Yeah, look, I've talked to Salente and others, and now two, three weeks into this, they're saying, we're not going to discuss where the money is, and you're just, you know, not going to get it back.
[01:57:36.371 --> 01:57:45.514]  But then we saw that kind of reverse with the CMT group come in and dump $300 million in, but that's not going to satisfy people, because this is a lot bigger amount.
[01:57:49.684 --> 01:57:55.951]  Well, actually, that's one of the things I'm very concerned about is who exactly is going to be on top of this ship.
[01:57:56.251 --> 01:57:57.433]  There's two types of trustees.
[01:57:57.453 --> 01:57:57.933]  You're right.
[01:57:57.953 --> 01:58:05.361]  Picard on the Madoff deal, I think he shocked everyone by actually saying, wait a minute, there's some guys who got some sweetheart deals, and he's trying to claw them back.
[01:58:05.401 --> 01:58:07.023]  He doesn't have much legal authority to do that.
[01:58:07.863 --> 01:58:12.687]  Uh, just keep in mind, and he's only been, only one of the big billionaires has given back the money.
[01:58:12.807 --> 01:58:15.770]  Actually, the guy who died, his wife gave it back, and she didn't want blood money.
[01:58:15.790 --> 01:58:29.821]  Uh, but in the case of MF Global, I'm worried we're gonna end up with something like the BP situation, where the number, where the trustees, this guy Ken Feinberg, who's usually used as their big trustee, and, uh, he's known, otherwise known as the reptile.
[01:58:30.382 --> 01:58:32.583]  Now, uh, when they use Feinberg...

[02:00:38.436 --> 02:00:40.817]  Okay, Greg Faust is our guest.
[02:00:41.597 --> 02:00:43.437]  Gary Franchi is going to pop in later in the hour.
[02:00:43.477 --> 02:00:47.458]  They've conducted a scientific poll and it basically mirrored what polls showed a few weeks ago.
[02:00:47.518 --> 02:00:53.980]  Ron Paul was in second in Iowa behind Herman Cain, but something else was shown in their poll.
[02:00:54.020 --> 02:00:55.140]  We'll tell you about that.
[02:00:56.061 --> 02:01:00.122]  Coming up, Ron Paul is number one in one category.
[02:01:00.562 --> 02:01:02.102]  We'll tell you about that coming up.
[02:01:02.822 --> 02:01:03.863]  We've commissioned polls before.
[02:01:03.883 --> 02:01:04.783]  I should do another
[02:01:06.204 --> 02:01:06.965]  Zogby or something.
[02:01:08.626 --> 02:01:12.609]  Finishing, you were talking about, Greg can answer the caller's question.
[02:01:12.629 --> 02:01:21.577]  The caller was asking about the individual charged with doling out the funds from the bankruptcy.
[02:01:22.678 --> 02:01:25.920]  And you were saying that you do know the M.O.
[02:01:25.981 --> 02:01:26.321]  on this guy.
[02:01:27.662 --> 02:01:31.885]  Well, I mean, what I'm saying is that this guy's halfway in between.
[02:01:31.925 --> 02:01:38.088]  There was a very good one, Picard, at handling the Madoff deal.
[02:01:39.229 --> 02:01:41.210]  But he still, he has no real power.
[02:01:41.250 --> 02:01:45.873]  He hasn't been able to get any real money, except from one of the billionaire's widows, because the guy died.
[02:01:45.893 --> 02:01:50.596]  But the other thieves are still holding on and saying, that's your tough problem, buddy.
[02:01:51.136 --> 02:01:56.019]  Then there's the trustee like we have on BP, Ken Feinberg, known as the reptile, right?
[02:01:56.319 --> 02:01:57.240]  Obama made a big deal.
[02:01:57.500 --> 02:01:58.841]  I've got twenty billion dollars for you.
[02:01:59.021 --> 02:02:01.582]  The guy hasn't even handed out five and that's all he's going to give out.
[02:02:01.822 --> 02:02:03.923]  They made sure that deal was cut.
[02:02:04.363 --> 02:02:07.225]  That deal was cut to make sure the people on the Gulf got shafted.
[02:02:07.285 --> 02:02:11.987]  Read, I have a section by the way called Mr. Fairness in Vulture's Picnic.
[02:02:12.247 --> 02:02:20.991]  I say when the energy finance combine needs a screwdriver, needs to screw the public, they hire a screwdriver and the Wall Street Journal calls him Mr. Fairness.
[02:02:21.451 --> 02:02:22.392]  That's the type of guy you get.
[02:02:22.452 --> 02:02:24.573]  Now this guy Giddens who is handling the
[02:02:25.493 --> 02:02:26.154]  I don't
[02:02:42.955 --> 02:02:48.577]  He literally stole about 8 billion dollars in the day of the collapse of Lehman Brothers.
[02:02:48.997 --> 02:02:51.278]  Just carted off 8 billion dollars in securities.
[02:02:51.538 --> 02:02:57.841]  And I haven't seen this guy say, hey guys, excuse me, that 8 billion ain't yours, could you please put it back?
[02:02:58.861 --> 02:03:01.302]  I don't trust this guy to do anything.
[02:03:01.802 --> 02:03:06.004]  That's what's incredible, they're robbing people's pensions, even private ones like yours.
[02:03:06.964 --> 02:03:08.906]  And somehow this is free market and beautiful.
[02:03:08.966 --> 02:03:10.687]  This is criminality.
[02:03:11.007 --> 02:03:17.733]  And just because they've got most of the regulators in their pockets, I don't see them being invincible in the final equation.
[02:03:18.353 --> 02:03:21.216]  And wouldn't the world be a better place without this?
[02:03:21.456 --> 02:03:23.137]  How many of these vultures are there?
[02:03:23.537 --> 02:03:25.799]  I mean, isn't there just a couple hundred top ones?
[02:03:25.819 --> 02:03:28.942]  I know Rothkopf, former head of the Kissinger Group, said there's 6,000 superclass.
[02:03:32.910 --> 02:03:33.871]  That's about right.
[02:03:33.991 --> 02:03:45.897]  I would say in Vulture's Picnic that there's about two dozen really top guys, like this guy Singer, who's worth about four billion bucks, who's now the Romney top economic advisor.
[02:03:45.917 --> 02:03:47.178]  This is what we really want.
[02:03:47.718 --> 02:04:00.485]  And again, I don't want to say it's just the Republicans, because you've got the deregulators, the decriminalizers, like Robert Rubin, who really ran the show and still is a shadow force directing the philosophy of Obama.
[02:04:00.986 --> 02:04:03.293]  Rubin bankrupted Citibank and got a $110 million bonus for it.
[02:04:05.114 --> 02:04:09.915]  You know, so I would say, you know, um, you know, if you, if you look in Volchek's picnic, you get kind of list.
[02:04:09.935 --> 02:04:18.477]  I actually want people to get to actually get the names of these guys and see how they operate rather than just talk about the national TV.
[02:04:18.897 --> 02:04:19.937]  But of course you're not.
[02:04:19.957 --> 02:04:25.558]  Uh, this information though, is getting out to the alternative media that is more and more becoming the dominant media.
[02:04:25.578 --> 02:04:28.739]  And that's why they're now moving in with all these attacks on free speech.
[02:04:29.059 --> 02:04:30.479]  That's why they're acclimating.
[02:04:30.519 --> 02:04:33.660]  I said, not only torture is good, but getting rid of free speech in America.
[02:04:33.660 --> 02:04:34.781]  Alex, you're a treasure.
[02:04:34.801 --> 02:04:36.161]  Thank you for getting the word out.
[02:04:36.181 --> 02:04:36.602]  Thank you.
[02:04:36.622 --> 02:04:38.122]  Alright, there goes Greg Pallast.
[02:04:38.142 --> 02:04:38.663]  Great guy.
[02:04:54.864 --> 02:04:58.609]  We're gonna come right back on the other side with Aaron Dykes riding shotgun with us.
[02:04:58.930 --> 02:05:00.472]  Gary Franchi's getting us that pole.
[02:05:00.792 --> 02:05:02.114]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:05:02.134 --> 02:05:08.803]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:05:09.064 --> 02:05:11.327]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:05:11.587 --> 02:05:16.771]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:05:16.971 --> 02:05:19.753]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:05:20.013 --> 02:05:22.135]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:05:22.335 --> 02:05:28.260]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:05:28.580 --> 02:05:31.782]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:05:31.962 --> 02:05:37.487]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:05:37.747 --> 02:05:39.068]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:05:39.388 --> 02:05:40.529]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:05:40.669 --> 02:05:43.210]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:05:43.351 --> 02:05:47.393]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:05:47.573 --> 02:05:52.075]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:05:52.195 --> 02:05:54.657]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[02:05:54.777 --> 02:05:58.479]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:05:58.639 --> 02:05:59.620]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:06:01.741 --> 02:06:03.223]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:06:03.443 --> 02:06:08.468]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:06:08.749 --> 02:06:10.110]  Saving means to make money.
[02:06:10.290 --> 02:06:19.080]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:06:19.800 --> 02:06:26.904]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:06:27.345 --> 02:06:34.949]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:06:35.349 --> 02:06:40.272]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[02:06:40.572 --> 02:06:42.733]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[02:06:45.515 --> 02:06:48.421]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[02:06:48.721 --> 02:06:50.946]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091.
[02:06:50.966 --> 02:06:53.230]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[02:07:01.607 --> 02:07:05.888]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[02:07:06.308 --> 02:07:12.170]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[02:07:12.730 --> 02:07:14.470]  Number one, study the past.
[02:07:15.010 --> 02:07:16.771]  History really does repeat itself.
[02:07:17.411 --> 02:07:21.132]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[02:07:22.256 --> 02:07:24.516]  Number three, take decisive action.
[02:07:25.357 --> 02:07:28.617]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[02:07:29.177 --> 02:07:33.918]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[02:07:34.239 --> 02:07:37.679]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[02:07:38.239 --> 02:07:41.100]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[02:07:41.640 --> 02:07:45.521]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:07:46.141 --> 02:07:50.388]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[02:07:51.069 --> 02:07:55.195]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:07:55.696 --> 02:07:57.859]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:08:05.680 --> 02:08:09.902]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:08:10.523 --> 02:08:11.343]  You want answers?
[02:08:12.124 --> 02:08:13.104]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:13.645 --> 02:08:17.267]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:17.847 --> 02:08:21.889]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:26.485 --> 02:08:32.669]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen on this November 22nd, 2011 Tuesday edition.
[02:08:32.689 --> 02:08:36.592]  We've got the final 52 minutes of this worldwide broadcast today.
[02:08:36.632 --> 02:08:38.873]  I'll be back in Austin tomorrow afternoon.
[02:08:38.893 --> 02:08:45.198]  I'm about to pull up stakes here and on my investigation and boy have we discovered a lot out here.
[02:08:45.558 --> 02:08:46.238]  Just amazing.
[02:08:46.638 --> 02:08:48.500]  Be back in Central Texas soon enough.
[02:08:48.880 --> 02:08:49.801]  Joining you via phone.
[02:08:49.881 --> 02:08:56.425]  Normally on the road I'd be joining you with crystal clear Skype but here in the high desert the internet is pretty much non-existent.
[02:08:57.965 --> 02:09:01.446]  We are going to get to Tom, Patrick, O'Brien, Kyle, Mike, and others.
[02:09:02.027 --> 02:09:13.150]  I'm going to eject here in about 10 minutes and hand the baton over to Aaron Dykes, Infowars.com video editor, researcher, and host also of the Nightly News.
[02:09:15.302 --> 02:09:25.489]  We're going to also break down some of the other news developments that have unfolded, but at the bottom of the hour, he'll go to your calls, for those of you holding, and then intersperse some of the other news I've not covered yet.
[02:09:45.282 --> 02:09:47.286]  That's how political these groups are.
[02:09:56.773 --> 02:10:04.823]  But what Franchi found basically integrates in with what other scientific polls have found.
[02:10:04.843 --> 02:10:07.005]  But he asked another question that hasn't been asked.
[02:10:07.606 --> 02:10:15.416]  When he asked the question about who would you vote for, it was Herman Cain in Iowa, and then, of course, it was...
[02:10:16.829 --> 02:10:19.311]  Ron Paul, and that's what a poll showed last week.
[02:10:19.351 --> 02:10:20.132]  He's number two.
[02:10:20.612 --> 02:10:21.553]  Same thing in New Hampshire.
[02:10:21.853 --> 02:10:24.636]  He's not just number three, he's number two.
[02:10:24.696 --> 02:10:28.159]  They've been desperately ignoring him, or he'd be number one.
[02:10:28.239 --> 02:10:30.661]  He's the doctor with the medicine this republic needs.
[02:10:31.501 --> 02:10:33.983]  He's a historian, he's an economist, he's a doctor.
[02:10:34.324 --> 02:10:35.224]  He's got the facts.
[02:10:35.305 --> 02:10:39.228]  He predicted everything that was going to happen through history, through understanding.
[02:10:40.350 --> 02:10:40.610]  I think so.
[02:11:02.011 --> 02:11:03.973]  Well, Alex, thanks for having me on for this breaking story.
[02:11:42.390 --> 02:11:43.312]  That's a respected group.
[02:11:43.353 --> 02:11:43.914]  Please continue.
[02:11:59.497 --> 02:11:59.818]  I think?
[02:12:23.161 --> 02:12:26.983]  So even at the worst-case scenario, Ron Paul is a one-point lead.
[02:12:27.324 --> 02:12:30.906]  Best-case scenario, seven-point lead in Iowa.
[02:12:30.986 --> 02:12:32.647]  By the way, I gotta stop you.
[02:12:32.707 --> 02:12:38.791]  This integrates in with national polls showing Ron Paul dead heat or three to five points.
[02:12:39.211 --> 02:12:42.813]  There's a spectrum of scientific polls, Zogby, Gallup, you name it.
[02:12:43.053 --> 02:12:49.577]  He's either dead heat or three, four, or five points ahead of Obama when they run those two head up against each other.
[02:12:49.897 --> 02:12:51.178]  This is big news.
[02:12:51.798 --> 02:12:52.519]  Please continue.
[02:12:53.726 --> 02:13:01.751]  So basically, Ron Paul leads at 25% with an approximate 4-point advantage over Gingrich and Herman Cain.
[02:13:02.491 --> 02:13:04.833]  Okay, now there's another question that we asked.
[02:13:04.853 --> 02:13:11.837]  I said, look, I want to know where the national security concerns are of the people of Iowa.
[02:13:12.177 --> 02:13:12.717]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:13:12.737 --> 02:13:15.759]  Tonight, there is a CNN debate about national security.
[02:13:21.800 --> 02:13:22.821]  Where do your concerns lie?
[02:13:23.201 --> 02:13:26.144]  Iran, China, Russia, Iraq?
[02:13:26.524 --> 02:13:31.628]  You know, and one of the answers was interventionist foreign policy.
[02:13:32.309 --> 02:13:44.639]  That came in at, what am I, 25% of all respondents said that interventionist foreign policy is the greatest threat to national security, Alex.
[02:13:44.939 --> 02:13:46.020]  This is a big story.
[02:13:46.923 --> 02:13:50.845]  It is, and you were right here to give us the poll first.
[02:13:51.425 --> 02:13:56.067]  So I do believe, I'm not there, I'm in southern Utah, but I believe we have the poll there.
[02:13:56.087 --> 02:14:00.229]  So we're going to try to put that on screen, or if Aaron has it there in studio, we can zoom in on that.
[02:14:00.529 --> 02:14:04.491]  Gary, start at the top of the poll and just read through the results.
[02:14:05.151 --> 02:14:08.773]  Again, tell folks, the company, and then run through this breaking news here.
[02:14:09.974 --> 02:14:12.995]  Well, basically the company was a tele-research corporation out of Indiana.
[02:14:19.975 --> 02:14:20.375]  I'm good.
[02:14:39.531 --> 02:14:40.552]  No other candidates, Alex.
[02:14:40.592 --> 02:14:42.975]  No other candidates have crossover appeal.
[02:14:43.655 --> 02:14:49.001]  Ron Paul is the only candidate that can actually take votes from Obama.
[02:14:49.461 --> 02:14:49.982]  Incredible.
[02:14:50.102 --> 02:14:53.906]  Aaron has the, and when I did a Zogby, that's how it was.
[02:14:54.006 --> 02:15:02.875]  One day I got the big first general ones, and then I got all these, this whole booklet of detailed breakdowns, and women this, men that, black, hispanic, native
[02:15:05.231 --> 02:15:05.932]  We're good to go.
[02:15:36.971 --> 02:15:42.173]  I have says new Iowa poll places Ron Paul firmly in first with 25 percent.
[02:15:42.653 --> 02:15:50.175]  Congressman Ron Paul is leading by a significant margin in Iowa according to results from a new teleresearch poll.
[02:15:50.695 --> 02:15:55.516]  Revolution PAC supported the presidential candidate Ron Paul by conducting the poll.
[02:15:56.096 --> 02:16:03.358]  And it gets into how disaffected Democrats and Independents were also included in the poll, with a very large sample size of 2,900.
[02:16:03.778 --> 02:16:08.460]  I believe the standard polls only use 1,000 normally, Alex.
[02:16:09.040 --> 02:16:09.540]  1,001, yeah.
[02:16:09.940 --> 02:16:16.542]  And that includes also in this 2,900 sample 700 likely Republican caucus goers.
[02:16:17.382 --> 02:16:22.304]  So that is an across-the-boards sampling of the Iowa voters.
[02:16:24.697 --> 02:16:27.822]  Francie, Gary Francie, joining us from ReportTheRepublic.org.
[02:16:28.964 --> 02:16:35.393]  To be clear, you did poll Republicans by themselves, then you did a general poll and found he was even over the top.
[02:16:35.433 --> 02:16:37.396]  He's in a dead heat with Republicans.
[02:16:37.757 --> 02:16:39.379]  Not second place, dead heat.
[02:16:40.280 --> 02:16:43.842]  Uh, but we now know other side of the polls, they claim he's second place, but that's how they spin them.
[02:16:43.862 --> 02:16:55.106]  Uh, our own internal info shows he's way over the top as number one, but you're saying Republicans, he is dead heat, uh, but you're saying that with across the board, he's winning.
[02:16:56.447 --> 02:16:59.788]  Yeah, and just to be clear, uh, Restore the Republic did not commission the poll.
[02:17:00.188 --> 02:17:03.369]  It was the Super PAC, uh, Revolution PAC that commissioned the poll.
[02:17:03.429 --> 02:17:04.150]  No, I understand.
[02:17:04.190 --> 02:17:06.251]  I'm plugging the fact that you also run Restore the Republic.
[02:17:07.411 --> 02:17:09.812]  Yeah, and what's interesting here is that
[02:17:11.639 --> 02:17:23.046]  We've actually significantly one-upped the Bloomberg survey, because we have actually more Republican caucus-goers, and we did, like you just mentioned, we asked, we had a jump question that asked those disaffected Democrats in
[02:17:48.095 --> 02:17:50.496]  Absolutely, and look folks, we need to help Ron Paul.
[02:17:50.516 --> 02:17:53.777]  He can't get it all done himself, and I'm glad you've done the Scientific Poll.
[02:17:53.797 --> 02:17:55.477]  I see the headline now at InfoWars.com, Scientific Poll.
[02:18:17.213 --> 02:18:27.762]  Ron Paul beats Obama in general election, in tie, or in dead heat with Cain and Gingrich.
[02:18:28.143 --> 02:18:30.184]  I mean that's it.
[02:18:30.585 --> 02:18:31.265]  Significant poll.
[02:18:31.345 --> 02:18:34.428]  Ron Paul beats Obama in general election.
[02:18:35.349 --> 02:18:35.969]  Significant poll.
[02:18:36.410 --> 02:18:39.592]  Ron Paul beats Obama in Iowa general election, something like that.
[02:18:39.933 --> 02:18:43.656]  And then sub-headline, in dead heat with other Republican leaders.
[02:18:43.956 --> 02:18:44.957]  I mean he is definitely
[02:18:46.994 --> 02:18:48.117]  Very good.
[02:19:32.007 --> 02:19:47.222]  Well, Gary, you certainly produced some amazing TV ads, and all I know is this is a great job of this poll.
[02:19:47.242 --> 02:19:48.523]  I'd like to see more of these polls.
[02:19:48.543 --> 02:19:50.405]  I'd like to see the Paul campaign do that.
[02:19:50.805 --> 02:19:53.007]  But he was going to be on last week, and that was a scheduling thing.
[02:19:53.027 --> 02:19:56.491]  I've been out of town this week, but he should be on next week, or I'll...
[02:19:57.291 --> 02:20:02.872]  Microplant powder can help unclog arteries and soften heart valves while removing heavy metals, virus, fungus, bacteria, and parasites.
[02:20:17.156 --> 02:20:20.699]  Plus it cleans and purifies the blood, lungs, stomach and colon.
[02:20:20.859 --> 02:20:23.841]  Keep your body clean with micro plant powder.

[02:20:30.660 --> 02:20:31.741]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:20:31.921 --> 02:20:36.304]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:20:36.484 --> 02:20:42.188]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:20:42.288 --> 02:20:45.690]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:20:45.930 --> 02:20:48.532]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:48.652 --> 02:20:53.555]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:20:53.715 --> 02:20:53.936]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:53.956 --> 02:20:55.357]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:03.303 --> 02:21:07.347]  Folks, have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on?
[02:21:07.768 --> 02:21:10.771]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[02:21:11.131 --> 02:21:15.195]  Because there's never been a better time to get ready for the winter power outages ahead.
[02:21:15.516 --> 02:21:16.156]  Here's why.
[02:21:16.517 --> 02:21:22.303]  Solar power generators are now available from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[02:21:22.643 --> 02:21:27.166]  Their emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[02:21:27.506 --> 02:21:33.570]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity from the sun.
[02:21:33.871 --> 02:21:37.473]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:21:37.733 --> 02:21:43.277]  Whether it's ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:21:43.677 --> 02:21:49.001]  When the power goes out this winter, you'll be ready with a solar-powered generator from Solutions from Science.
[02:21:49.281 --> 02:21:52.126]  Go to MySolarBackup.com for more information.
[02:21:52.286 --> 02:21:54.489]  That's MySolarBackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:22:00.481 --> 02:22:05.985]  There are limitless ways to go into business for yourself, but most involve substantial capital and risk.
[02:22:06.325 --> 02:22:09.447]  Our InfoWarsTeam.com operation is different.
[02:22:09.527 --> 02:22:20.835]  We promote premium quality health, energy, and skincare products using dynamic, caring personalities and state-of-the-art media technology to spread a powerful message of health.

[02:22:30.941 --> 02:22:33.202]  It is you that defines the reward level.
[02:22:33.342 --> 02:22:40.246]  Whether you are seeking a few hundred extra dollars per month or a six or even seven figure annual income, it's up to you.
[02:22:40.507 --> 02:22:41.427]  Want to find out more?
[02:22:41.547 --> 02:22:47.931]  Shoot an email with InfoWars Team in the subject line to InfoWars Team Coordinator, MZ, and tell him a little bit about yourself.
[02:22:48.191 --> 02:22:50.916]  That's the initials MZ and Infowarsteam.com.
[02:22:51.077 --> 02:22:53.361]  That's MZ and Infowarsteam.com.
[02:22:53.561 --> 02:22:57.269]  I only promote products that I truly believe in, and these are phenomenal.

[02:23:01.169 --> 02:23:04.311]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.
[02:23:04.531 --> 02:23:12.535]  I designed our top-selling holster, the SuperTuck Deluxe, to solve the problems of being poked, pinched, and gouged while carrying concealed.
[02:23:12.715 --> 02:23:17.838]  The SuperTuck Deluxe is the most comfortable, most concealable holster on the market today.

[02:23:30.823 --> 02:23:34.546]  That's the sound of your door being kicked in by an intruder with a single kick.
[02:23:35.867 --> 02:23:41.050]  That's the sound of the same door now protected by the Door Sentinel at MySafeDoor.com.

[02:23:50.356 --> 02:23:55.040]  16 kicks later, and the Door Sentinel is still holding strong.
[02:23:55.200 --> 02:23:56.501]  MySafeDoor.com.
[02:23:56.601 --> 02:23:58.162]  That's MySafeDoor.com.
[02:24:12.432 --> 02:24:13.054]  We're good.
[02:24:22.893 --> 02:24:24.193]  We are back from break.
[02:24:24.773 --> 02:24:32.595]  Alex will be joining us again tomorrow and of course he'll be live with Mike Adams tomorrow on his way back.
[02:24:32.655 --> 02:24:43.098]  We thought we still had Gary Franchi but he will be popping in later on the InfoWars Nightly News tonight and it's a very interesting poll he's conducted.
[02:24:43.138 --> 02:24:52.080]  We've done this before at Alex's office as he mentioned with Zogby back in the 2008 when Ron Paul really did have a name recognition issue
[02:24:52.700 --> 02:24:53.081]  I don't know.
[02:25:12.879 --> 02:25:17.363]  I specifically remember whoever had written the biography for Mitt Romney.
[02:25:17.744 --> 02:25:18.925]  It was written very loaded.
[02:25:18.985 --> 02:25:35.160]  It called him a hero of the Olympics and really praised him in ways that it didn't praise the other candidates at a time when Mitt Romney was topping all those polls, even though that didn't play out whatsoever in the 2008 so-called elections, which are obviously manipulated behind the scenes.
[02:25:35.920 --> 02:25:58.016]  So it's encouraging that Ron Paul is showing up in a more balanced poll that surveys not only likely Republican caucus goers but the quote-unquote disaffected independents and Democrats and that's really what they always try to sell is the crossover mainstream middle-of-the-road appeal between both parties saying that someone too far to the right or left
[02:25:58.496 --> 02:26:03.659]  I would marginalize in a general election, but Ron Paul is a different kind of candidate.
[02:26:03.679 --> 02:26:18.466]  He's out of the box of that strictly left-right line paradigm system, largely because of his national and international foreign policy issues, well domestic policy and international, and especially his understanding of economic issues.
[02:26:18.506 --> 02:26:24.589]  He really has the clout in this issue, and it's interesting that so many people would identify with the
[02:26:25.189 --> 02:26:28.011]  Interventionist foreign policy as part of the major problem.
[02:26:28.051 --> 02:26:28.952]  Of course it is.
[02:26:29.112 --> 02:26:42.263]  Elections are never run on moral issues, but if you have moral issues in the race, certainly our great expenditure and our wanton killing overseas is not something we want to be engaged in.
[02:26:42.303 --> 02:26:48.187]  And all the other candidates, particularly in both parties, well, particularly in both parties, that is,
[02:26:49.188 --> 02:26:53.674]  Are totally online with going along with all the globalist intervention recommendations.
[02:26:53.694 --> 02:26:59.721]  You've heard people like Herman Cain and the debates identifying how he would simply go along with his advisors.
[02:27:00.122 --> 02:27:02.645]  People like Henry Kissinger he talks to behind the scenes.
[02:27:03.426 --> 02:27:08.212]  Mitt Romney totally part of the system ready to go along with the war against Iran or whomever.
[02:27:08.832 --> 02:27:11.054]  And that really goes for almost all the candidates.
[02:27:11.074 --> 02:27:26.167]  Certainly you've seen President Obama expanding into more and more adventurous territories overseas, even as the Arab Spring unfolded and blossomed into tyrannies everywhere and wars in many places.
[02:27:26.727 --> 02:27:28.608]  So we hope that doesn't continue to grow.
[02:27:29.008 --> 02:27:31.709]  Now, we are going to take your calls on the other side of this break.
[02:27:32.369 --> 02:27:33.830]  I want to give the number out right now.
[02:27:34.050 --> 02:27:34.710]  It's 1-800-259-9231.
[02:27:34.770 --> 02:27:40.832]  But right now, we'll go ahead and go to Tom in Arizona.
[02:27:42.032 --> 02:27:42.593]  Are you there, Tom?
[02:27:42.633 --> 02:27:43.253]  Hey, great show.
[02:27:43.293 --> 02:27:45.634]  Those polls were wonderful news.
[02:27:46.454 --> 02:27:48.635]  My comment is from your previous guest, Greg.
[02:27:49.015 --> 02:27:54.397]  I can tell you that I used to work as a broker for one of the top three commercial banks back in the late 90s and early 2000s.
[02:27:56.283 --> 02:28:01.906]  After we had a big merger, the new company came in with a new option for your 401k.
[02:28:01.946 --> 02:28:04.728]  If you kept the old one, you'd have the same investment options.
[02:28:04.788 --> 02:28:09.871]  However, you would lose some of the benefits, such as taking a loan against the 401k and that sort of thing.
[02:28:10.071 --> 02:28:13.313]  However, if you went to the new one, they restored all the benefits.
[02:28:13.533 --> 02:28:17.076]  In other words, you could take a loan against your 401k, the same investment options.
[02:28:17.716 --> 02:28:19.157]  Your statement would reflect
[02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:21.081]  Those investments.
[02:28:21.241 --> 02:28:28.707]  However, by going to the new one, the bank then had the right to take those funds and invest it any way they wanted to.
[02:28:31.248 --> 02:28:33.690]  My opinion, they leveraged everything.
[02:28:33.750 --> 02:28:36.632]  This is no different than Bernie Madoff.
[02:28:38.854 --> 02:28:39.114]  Right.
[02:28:39.535 --> 02:28:40.095]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:28:41.396 --> 02:28:43.518]  And the other thing I think your listeners need to know is
[02:28:45.041 --> 02:28:51.524]  Who is FINRA, the regulatory agency over your broker, over MF Global and the whole works, who are supposed to oversee all this?
[02:28:52.004 --> 02:29:01.347]  If you go to Google and look to see what the panel is, FINRA is a regulatory agency.
[02:29:02.148 --> 02:29:08.630]  It's a board member of people from Wall Street who are regulating themselves.
[02:29:09.490 --> 02:29:11.151]  That's why this stuff is happening.
[02:29:12.984 --> 02:29:14.787]  They are protecting the big institutions.
[02:29:15.188 --> 02:29:18.312]  Your little broker is not allowed to do what these big brokers can do.
[02:29:18.733 --> 02:29:19.775]  These big institutions.
[02:29:20.536 --> 02:29:26.365]  And they, in my opinion, they're going to keep you in these markets and they're going to keep selling you short.
[02:29:26.966 --> 02:29:28.028]  Naked short selling you.
[02:29:30.172 --> 02:29:32.394]  And it's just fraud all the way around.
[02:29:32.614 --> 02:29:34.055]  I agree, it's animal behavior.
[02:29:34.115 --> 02:29:37.057]  Coming up on the break, I'll let you get a final word in on the other side.
[02:29:37.117 --> 02:29:42.680]  But yeah, I know we talked to William K. Black, interviewed him for Obama Deception and Follow the Republic.
[02:29:42.981 --> 02:29:45.362]  He talked about Bush calling off all the regulators.
[02:29:45.702 --> 02:29:47.884]  Apparently Obama has gone even further.
[02:29:48.224 --> 02:29:53.187]  Stay tuned, more calls ahead and we'll get into some- We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.207 --> 02:29:56.810]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.786 --> 02:30:16.238]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[02:30:17.259 --> 02:30:20.922]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:30:21.929 --> 02:30:33.940]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:30:34.701 --> 02:30:41.967]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[02:30:42.648 --> 02:30:52.252]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.

[02:32:07.636 --> 02:32:12.418]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:32:12.779 --> 02:32:19.582]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:32:21.503 --> 02:32:23.984]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:32:25.585 --> 02:32:27.886]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:32:29.998 --> 02:32:33.880]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[02:32:34.601 --> 02:32:37.702]  Blue Diamond Gussets, got it.
[02:32:38.423 --> 02:32:39.243]  Others don't.
[02:32:39.663 --> 02:32:41.544]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:32:41.804 --> 02:32:43.305]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:32:43.585 --> 02:32:46.167]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:32:46.487 --> 02:32:52.730]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:32:53.111 --> 02:32:55.332]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:32:55.812 --> 02:32:57.833]  Diamond Gusset Jeans, got it.
[02:32:58.173 --> 02:32:58.674]  Others don't.
[02:33:29.198 --> 02:33:43.400]  The last two decades have really seen the gates of hell open up financially in terms of breaking down the wall of Glass-Steagall that separated commercial and investment banking and it's just gotten progressively worse from there.
[02:33:43.420 --> 02:33:44.402]  There are numerous...
[02:33:44.602 --> 02:33:45.483]  We're good to go.
[02:34:06.475 --> 02:34:14.341]  Particularly on places like Wall Street and the related spheres and I understand that that trend has gotten even worse under Obama.
[02:34:14.702 --> 02:34:25.089]  Clearly one of the most transparent Wall Street candidates even as he appeals to much of his base on the basis of tackling the big business interest.
[02:34:25.149 --> 02:34:30.914]  It's all a fraud of course but we were speaking with Tom in Arizona and he was on this point of regulation.
[02:34:30.954 --> 02:34:31.134]  Tom?
[02:34:32.509 --> 02:34:34.290]  Yes, I just want to kind of finish up on it.
[02:34:34.490 --> 02:34:38.351]  The regulators are stacked against the common folk in the United States.
[02:34:38.811 --> 02:34:43.372]  The only thing that's keeping this thing together, the whole economy is a Ponzi scheme.
[02:34:43.813 --> 02:34:46.393]  It's the ability of Bernanke to print money out of thin air.
[02:34:46.533 --> 02:34:53.576]  We saw what Bernie Sanders, when he audited the Fed and found an additional $16 trillion, which nobody knows.
[02:34:53.956 --> 02:34:57.037]  People, they have leveraged everything out there.
[02:34:57.117 --> 02:34:57.937]  What you see on your
[02:35:00.302 --> 02:35:00.942]  Really there.
[02:35:01.222 --> 02:35:05.444]  That's why this endless printing of money, to keep fooling you, has to continue.
[02:35:05.564 --> 02:35:08.486]  Until one day, I don't know when it's gonna be, but it's gonna end.
[02:35:09.366 --> 02:35:10.406]  That's all I gotta say.
[02:35:10.647 --> 02:35:11.387]  Go Ron Paul.
[02:35:12.600 --> 02:35:13.380]  Okay, thanks Tom.
[02:35:13.400 --> 02:35:16.602]  We're going to jam in some more calls in just a few moments here.
[02:35:16.742 --> 02:35:20.804]  The call-in number is 1-800-259-9231 to join us.
[02:35:21.324 --> 02:35:28.768]  But, of course, we do rely on your support here at InfoWars and we have a lot of important specials right now in time for the holiday season.
[02:35:29.148 --> 02:35:34.011]  I know a lot of people get caught up in the gift-giving of Christmas and other holidays at this time of year.
[02:35:34.931 --> 02:35:41.373]  Uh, so maybe it's appropriate that InfoWars has a 99.95 special for all 18 of Alex's films.
[02:35:41.433 --> 02:35:43.773]  It's really more than 18, I think, if you count them right.
[02:35:44.174 --> 02:35:52.336]  Things like the Police State Trilogy with three films in one set, and stuff like Dark Secrets with two films, uh, one an update on the other.
[02:35:52.396 --> 02:35:53.356]  But it's a great gift.
[02:35:53.416 --> 02:35:55.417]  It comes in the plastic wrap package.
[02:35:55.857 --> 02:35:57.297]  It's something nice and attractive.
[02:35:57.317 --> 02:36:00.178]  You can give to friends, families, neighbors, even strangers.
[02:36:00.618 --> 02:36:00.758]  I don't
[02:36:17.958 --> 02:36:30.827]  You watch the film, but you really learn about the globalists behind the throne, the true system that has hijacked our country and the rest of the globe and taken it over through these puppet presidents, the way they sell you an image.
[02:36:31.187 --> 02:36:35.650]  Remember, these elections are nothing more than just the marketing of candidates.
[02:36:35.950 --> 02:36:39.313]  It's no different than the commercials you see on TV for products.
[02:36:39.793 --> 02:36:40.494]  We're good to go.
[02:36:58.536 --> 02:37:05.760]  To plug another part of our special, until the end of November you can sign up for a 15-day free trial of PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:37:06.140 --> 02:37:20.207]  If you wondered what is up with the InfoWars Nightly News, a great broadcast we do now five nights a week, you can tune in live and watch it as it airs instead of later after it's no longer completely fresh news on places like YouTube.
[02:37:20.547 --> 02:37:23.509]  It's great that you can get it there too and get out the word and share it with
[02:37:23.909 --> 02:37:25.750]  Friends, family, contact, etc.
[02:37:26.070 --> 02:37:35.513]  But you can watch it live, you can download them, you can stream Alex's live three-hour radio show, and there's plenty of other specials as well, as well as the ebooks and the rest of it.
[02:37:35.893 --> 02:37:39.875]  Again, you can get that through the end of November on a 15-day free trial.
[02:37:39.895 --> 02:37:40.575]  See if you like it.
[02:37:41.115 --> 02:37:45.418]  Then, if you do like it, we have great special discounts for the holiday season.
[02:37:46.038 --> 02:37:48.279]  $39.95, I think, for a yearly membership.
[02:37:48.559 --> 02:37:53.042]  And if you get it with the DVDs, it's not $100 just for the DVDs.
[02:37:53.082 --> 02:37:59.286]  It's $129, an even greater discount there if you buy the membership with the DVD package.
[02:37:59.706 --> 02:38:04.769]  And you can, of course, share that with five other people as well, so that could be part of your holiday gift-giving.
[02:38:05.189 --> 02:38:06.530]  I wish I could be a guest on the show one day.
[02:38:06.570 --> 02:38:10.851]  I do have a question and I'm sure you can answer for Alex Jones or on behalf of the production.
[02:38:28.132 --> 02:38:35.555]  In terms of vaccinations, outside of our children being walking dead, I think the vaccines are the number one threat to our children.
[02:38:36.635 --> 02:38:41.697]  My children hasn't received all of his shots, so in turn, my family's shunning me.
[02:38:41.877 --> 02:38:45.678]  Literally, my father has forsaken me because of the argument.
[02:38:46.418 --> 02:38:50.880]  My fiance and I argue over the vaccines that he will or will not get.
[02:38:52.360 --> 02:38:57.562]  Is there any solid answer as to what one can do, you know, in parenthood,
[02:38:59.741 --> 02:39:21.423]  Besides moving off of the grid, outside of, you know, sheltering or hiding one's own family from vaccines or forced inoculations, does anyone, would someone like yourself have an answer as to how to avoid, how to, you know, get your child into school without vaccines and such?
[02:39:22.230 --> 02:39:28.452]  Well, as far as the school issue, the perception that it is a law is a hoax, at least in almost every place I've read about.
[02:39:29.013 --> 02:39:34.975]  Among other things, they have a waiver for religious exemption, but I think it also covers ideological exemption.
[02:39:35.835 --> 02:39:42.798]  But as far as dealing with your family and your fiancé or spouse, as well as your parents, I mean, I haven't been through that myself.
[02:39:42.818 --> 02:39:45.819]  I'm not a parent yet, but obviously that could be a big issue.
[02:39:45.859 --> 02:39:46.199]  You want to
[02:39:46.639 --> 02:39:49.401]  Try to show them the package inserts and bring them the truth.
[02:39:49.481 --> 02:39:52.104]  But just remember, it's your child's life at stake.
[02:39:52.144 --> 02:39:54.205]  It's your family at stake.
[02:39:54.305 --> 02:39:55.126]  It is your life.
[02:39:55.186 --> 02:39:56.447]  It's not the federal government.
[02:39:56.487 --> 02:39:59.430]  It's not the big systems life to play games with.
[02:39:59.990 --> 02:40:02.332]  And that stuff has been shown to be very dangerous.
[02:40:02.352 --> 02:40:04.053]  There's numerous health effects.
[02:40:04.093 --> 02:40:06.936]  There's articles all over Infowars.com and Natural News.
[02:40:07.376 --> 02:40:10.439]  I'm not an expert in that area, so I can't speak too much on it.
[02:40:11.159 --> 02:40:21.051]  As far as awakening the family to those issues, I think it's probably something that takes time, but look how many more vaccines they give out now than they did a decade or two decades ago.
[02:40:21.071 --> 02:40:28.640]  Exactly, and so are there any vaccines left that you shouldn't be so fearful of?
[02:40:32.301 --> 02:40:33.702]  Well, it's going to be a case by case.
[02:40:33.742 --> 02:40:37.124]  I mean, it has to do with the ingredients and also the way it was developed.
[02:40:37.525 --> 02:40:43.909]  A lot of the things it's supposed to protect you against knowingly grow, change and mutate over time.
[02:40:43.949 --> 02:40:47.851]  So that's one reason why it's hard to target with mass vaccinations.
[02:40:47.931 --> 02:40:54.976]  But the other side of it is the thimerosal and the other ill ingredients that they throw in there as kind of a sociological goody.
[02:40:55.276 --> 02:40:56.797]  You've heard Alex on this issue before.
[02:40:56.817 --> 02:41:01.841]  I mean, I would just encourage you to research it because I can't tell you some silver bullet key here.
[02:41:02.421 --> 02:41:03.282]  Any other words, Kyle?
[02:41:04.042 --> 02:41:04.242]  Yes.
[02:41:05.583 --> 02:41:06.483]  Well, I appreciate that.
[02:41:06.503 --> 02:41:10.885]  I also have one comment on the Ronald Paul campaign.
[02:41:11.986 --> 02:41:21.691]  When one hears about a secession, or when people in such a state as Texas speak of a secession, and I think
[02:41:22.975 --> 02:41:39.826]  That leads kind of to an option of just declaring, because with the bloodlines of the Illuminati, with Dick Cheney being related to Bush, or however you want to look at it, I think at some point we should all just claim Ron Paul is our president.
[02:41:41.127 --> 02:41:47.532]  Because when the media, all over, every single channel says, he can't become president, he won't be president, he's not going to be able to be president.
[02:41:48.612 --> 02:41:50.974]  Well actually, in terms of bloodlines and such,
[02:41:52.156 --> 02:41:55.818]  Maybe that is the case, and maybe it's time for us just to claim him as our president.
[02:41:56.699 --> 02:41:57.759]  I think that's a great idea.
[02:41:57.799 --> 02:42:03.502]  I mean, to me, that fits in with what I think is the archetypal theme of, I am Spartacus.
[02:42:03.562 --> 02:42:12.107]  When Spartacus led the slave rebellion in Rome prior to the Caesars, they went looking for him in the countryside, at least as depicted in the movie.
[02:42:12.127 --> 02:42:16.889]  I'm not sure if it's entirely historically accurate, but they began to say, where is Spartacus?
[02:42:16.929 --> 02:42:17.410]  Where is he?
[02:42:17.430 --> 02:42:20.291]  And all the commoners stood up and said, I am Spartacus.
[02:42:20.351 --> 02:42:21.312]  No, I'm Spartacus.
[02:42:21.832 --> 02:42:22.972]  In other words, who are you going to take?
[02:42:23.113 --> 02:42:24.213]  Are you free humanity?
[02:42:24.593 --> 02:42:28.935]  Are we going to stand up for ourselves and declare that we're not part of this takeover system?
[02:42:29.295 --> 02:42:34.037]  We see through it, and people like Ron Paul represent the idea of that true freedom.
[02:42:34.397 --> 02:42:36.537]  And that's why so many people have gathered to support him.
[02:42:36.557 --> 02:42:39.939]  I think it's a great idea to declare Ron Paul is my president.
[02:42:39.959 --> 02:42:42.140]  I think they have bumper stickers to that effect already.
[02:42:44.600 --> 02:42:45.561]  I've got a note here.
[02:42:46.707 --> 02:42:59.792]  Vaccine not one vaccine has ever been tested with concern to cancer Not sure what the source is on that, but I mean yeah, do your own research There's all kinds of shenanigans and ill plans with the vaccines.
[02:42:59.812 --> 02:43:03.314]  I don't want to get any more into that today though Patrick in New York.
[02:43:03.354 --> 02:43:04.194]  Let's see what you have.
[02:43:04.574 --> 02:43:08.656]  Thanks for the call there Good how are you?
[02:43:09.724 --> 02:43:10.204]  Not bad.
[02:43:10.384 --> 02:43:15.668]  Um, you know, I just wanted to talk about, you know, the educational system in this country, especially college, you know?
[02:43:16.428 --> 02:43:17.569]  Uh, I'm in college right now.
[02:43:17.609 --> 02:43:18.590]  I'm in community college.
[02:43:19.250 --> 02:43:27.375]  And, uh, you know, I noticed, I'm taking a world politics class, and it is the biggest propaganda lie that I have ever heard in my life.
[02:43:27.495 --> 02:43:30.317]  And somebody that's awake to this can obviously see it.
[02:43:30.357 --> 02:43:35.200]  Like, the whole textbook, the whole entire textbook just talks about, you know, solutions.
[02:43:35.300 --> 02:43:35.841]  It says, like,
[02:43:36.397 --> 02:43:44.081]  You know, it says our problems, like, uh, as to war, as to our economic crisis, and every solution that the book gives is over-governed.
[02:43:45.141 --> 02:44:01.689]  And it's just, you know, I think it's absolutely sickening, and I keep on pointing this out in class, and my professor is like, he's like, no, no, no, you don't know what you're talking about, and he tries to, like, stop me from saying, like, what, uh, from essentially speaking my mind on these topics.
[02:44:02.338 --> 02:44:07.605]  And he just keeps on going on with the, you know, global governance is good, you know, trust the U.N.
[02:44:07.625 --> 02:44:10.329]  He goes into great detail about how great the U.N.
[02:44:10.429 --> 02:44:11.591]  is and how great the E.U.
[02:44:11.731 --> 02:44:13.173]  is, when in fact the E.U.
[02:44:13.253 --> 02:44:15.637]  is going under right before our eyes.
[02:44:16.197 --> 02:44:17.880]  I just want to know what you think about that.
[02:44:18.789 --> 02:44:20.750]  Well, that is a big issue, Patrick.
[02:44:20.830 --> 02:44:45.838]  I mean, the history of education and the way it developed, particularly in the 20th century, is surprisingly shocking, but you can trace it back to, as Charlotte Isserby pointed out in our recent special, which you can find up on Prison Planet TV, the extent to which Skull and Bones and other elitist families, the Rockefeller Foundation and more, really brought to life the modern education system, which did away largely with the classical education,
[02:44:46.198 --> 02:44:46.358]  I think?
[02:45:08.590 --> 02:45:10.532]  Has these shared values and so forth.
[02:45:10.912 --> 02:45:14.715]  And it's definitely indoctrination in these schools, even if for well-meaning reasons.
[02:45:15.116 --> 02:45:21.101]  In some cases, there's a lot of good teachers in the system, but they are required to read from those textbooks.
[02:45:21.181 --> 02:45:25.724]  And we've showed you chapters on September 11th over the years in grade school and more.
[02:45:26.765 --> 02:45:34.592]  On the other hand, I went through UT's School of Government and yeah, I would have to concur, it is full of globalist propaganda.
[02:45:35.472 --> 02:45:37.173]  I'll keep it short for time's sake.
[02:45:37.513 --> 02:45:38.673]  Any other things, Patrick?
[02:45:39.774 --> 02:45:55.380]  Um, you know, and I just want to say, I did see Charlotte Isabeau's, uh, you know, I did see her work, and I was interested by it, you know, and always, like, a personal story with me, you know, I, you know, ever since I was a young child, you know, I always
[02:45:56.010 --> 02:46:07.218]  I went to school, you know, and like when I was really little, like, I would, I was always interested in learning, I loved learning, but I was never the person to do homework because I didn't want to, I didn't want to submit to authority figures.
[02:46:07.598 --> 02:46:16.284]  That's the main thing, and like, I would, uh, you know, I wouldn't do any homework, you know, I'd probably fool around a little bit, and then when test time came, I'd get, like, high grades.
[02:46:16.804 --> 02:46:23.449]  You know, I'm not trying to toot my own horn or anything, but like, that would drive teachers completely up the wall because the main reason is
[02:46:24.232 --> 02:46:29.962]  You know, I had a problem with authority, and that's basically what the American educational system is.
[02:46:30.062 --> 02:46:34.911]  It's more about submitting to authority, I feel, than to actually about learning.
[02:46:35.799 --> 02:46:45.786]  Yes, certainly, and I've seen people who perform well in school as well as those who did poorly all rolled over by the system and intimidated out of the great potential we have in ourselves.
[02:46:45.806 --> 02:46:50.450]  I mean, I don't want to get too much more into it today, but I certainly have a lot of thoughts on that subject.
[02:46:50.630 --> 02:46:54.533]  O'Brien, are you calling with the 1984 moniker, or is that your real name?
[02:46:55.553 --> 02:46:58.215]  Yes, this is my real name.
[02:46:58.235 --> 02:46:59.156]  Welcome to the program.
[02:46:59.736 --> 02:47:00.277]  Thank you.
[02:47:00.457 --> 02:47:03.099]  I had a question for the other guest, but
[02:47:04.645 --> 02:47:16.769]  I guess I could ask you, um, well how do we prepare for the, uh, for the hard times ahead that will be coming down the pike?
[02:47:16.789 --> 02:47:20.710]  Hello?
[02:47:22.093 --> 02:47:24.897]  Yeah, well, I mean, that's a complicated issue.
[02:47:24.917 --> 02:47:37.755]  I'm not really coming from a financial expert point of view, but you want to try to limit your exposure to what we know are fraudulent systems and try to make preparations in case you lose a job or have no opportunities in the coming markets.
[02:47:38.616 --> 02:47:40.157]  I mean, there's a lot more you can read on it.
[02:47:40.237 --> 02:47:50.842]  Gold and silver are a good thing to get a hold of as a reserve, but yeah, you want to try to disconnect yourself from the parts that are falling apart and try to find opportunity where you can, I think.
[02:47:51.562 --> 02:47:55.244]  Jordan, let's take your, I'm sorry, Justice in Michigan, let's take your call now.
[02:47:56.404 --> 02:47:57.004]  Hello, Aaron.
[02:47:57.305 --> 02:47:57.965]  Hi, how you doing?
[02:47:58.988 --> 02:47:59.528]  Pretty good.
[02:47:59.809 --> 02:48:04.132]  I've come up with a great idea for the movement.
[02:48:10.282 --> 02:48:11.242]  Ideas are bulletproof.
[02:48:11.942 --> 02:48:14.803]  Um, I've come up with a social network just for us.
[02:48:15.043 --> 02:48:17.304]  I've made it, I've built it, I've put it together.
[02:48:17.964 --> 02:48:21.485]  It's filled with tons of important material and others.
[02:48:22.265 --> 02:48:25.926]  Um, and the address is PatriotSpot.WallFM.
[02:48:26.786 --> 02:48:30.267]  If anybody would like to join there and check it out, they're welcome to join.
[02:48:30.287 --> 02:48:35.229]  Um, just, I want to make another tool.
[02:48:35.289 --> 02:48:35.889]  I want to help.
[02:48:36.009 --> 02:48:36.469]  I want to
[02:48:37.699 --> 02:48:38.479]  We need unity.
[02:48:38.639 --> 02:48:42.460]  We cannot win this without unity, and this is a place for us to come together.
[02:48:43.901 --> 02:48:44.401]  Yeah, right.
[02:48:44.461 --> 02:48:45.721]  Like minds have to get together.
[02:48:45.761 --> 02:48:48.222]  So tell us real quickly where that is and then let's move on.
[02:48:49.142 --> 02:48:53.484]  It's, uh, patriot.wall.fm.
[02:48:54.404 --> 02:48:55.304]  Okay, thanks a lot.
[02:48:55.544 --> 02:48:57.305]  And, uh, now let's go to Jordan in Texas.
[02:48:58.885 --> 02:48:59.065]  Welcome.
[02:48:59.586 --> 02:49:00.426]  Hey Aaron, how's it going?
[02:49:00.706 --> 02:49:01.127]  How is this going?
[02:49:01.167 --> 02:49:11.334]  I've got a good idea for, you know, this thing I'm throwing at Paul, you know, because as he's getting closer to winning, I believe, the GOP debate and everything, I think he's really getting pretty close.
[02:49:11.354 --> 02:49:17.158]  So I think what we need to start doing is start occupying the mainstream media's phone lines and their physical buildings.
[02:49:18.078 --> 02:49:21.141]  Or as my friend would say, the shame stream media.
[02:49:21.621 --> 02:49:25.384]  But I really think we need to start occupying the phones and the mainstream media so we can
[02:49:26.204 --> 02:49:32.452]  I start demanding that Ron Paul gets more than just 89 seconds or a few minutes because they give him a few minutes, they give everybody else like 10-12 minutes.
[02:49:32.893 --> 02:49:36.518]  And we just start demanding that Ron Paul gets more time because he's getting closer to winning this thing.
[02:49:37.651 --> 02:49:45.257]  Absolutely, and obviously they have been trying to black him out from media coverage in many ways in this cycle and in the 2008 cycle.
[02:49:45.698 --> 02:49:48.540]  It hasn't stopped him, but it has probably slowed him.
[02:49:49.121 --> 02:49:54.665]  And regardless of Ron Paul's position in this race, the whole system is fraudulent anyway.
[02:49:54.705 --> 02:49:57.007]  They write the election laws to favor the two parties.
[02:49:57.367 --> 02:50:03.773]  They put in these sham candidates who they know are going to go along with the establishment agenda, the global government agenda.
[02:50:04.133 --> 02:50:04.774]  No man Aaron, that's it.
[02:50:23.797 --> 02:50:24.537]  All right, have a good one.
[02:50:24.717 --> 02:50:26.218]  And we'll be back on the other side.
[02:50:26.278 --> 02:50:28.119]  I'm going to hit one last news blitz.
[02:50:28.599 --> 02:50:30.840]  And of course, today is November 22nd.
[02:50:30.900 --> 02:50:38.104]  A lot of people have made the day of JFK's assassination a memorial to occupy and attempt to end the Fed.
[02:50:38.144 --> 02:50:42.126]  A lot of those protests are going on at Federal Reserve locations across the country.
[02:50:42.386 --> 02:50:44.247]  There's been other actions on the Fed this year.
[02:50:44.367 --> 02:50:45.588]  Maybe you should check that out.
[02:50:45.988 --> 02:50:46.948]  Infowars.com.
[02:50:47.088 --> 02:50:48.189]  We'll be back with more.
[02:50:48.549 --> 02:50:49.890]  And Alex back later.
[02:50:50.270 --> 02:50:50.970]  Stay tuned tonight.
[02:50:51.050 --> 02:50:52.171]  Infowars Nightly News.
[02:51:01.016 --> 02:51:03.498]  As we age, we lose both strength and muscle mass.
[02:51:03.998 --> 02:51:09.702]  Undamaged whey protein from grass-fed cows is nature's most powerful food to gain back lost muscle.
[02:51:10.063 --> 02:51:15.346]  Virtually all whey protein powders or drinks have been damaged during processing or are high in sugar.
[02:51:15.487 --> 02:51:21.071]  This damaged whey causes a significant loss in the ability of the body to build new muscle proteins.
[02:51:21.611 --> 02:51:26.675]  The high sugar content will stop all the benefits of your growth hormone from causing muscle repair.
[02:51:27.375 --> 02:51:27.975]  We're good to go!
[02:51:45.225 --> 02:51:45.485]  Thank you.

[02:54:20.116 --> 02:54:24.937]  And of course tonight on the InfoWars Nightly News, we're going to get more into this breaking news.
[02:54:24.997 --> 02:54:29.199]  The new Iowa poll that places Ron Paul firmly in first with 25%.
[02:54:29.879 --> 02:54:40.363]  That's right, when they do honest polling, it produces a lot better results for our kind of candidates than when you see the mainstream people spinning and massaging the data.
[02:54:40.803 --> 02:54:42.106]  to their own purposes.
[02:54:42.526 --> 02:54:44.029]  But that's the way elections go.
[02:54:44.790 --> 02:54:46.013]  They call it fighting dirty.
[02:54:46.053 --> 02:54:53.426]  We just want to let people know that Ron Paul does have support because of the ideas he supports, not because he's some kind of
[02:54:54.763 --> 02:54:57.684]  Just figurehead leader like all the other candidates.
[02:54:58.364 --> 02:55:10.167]  You know, also in the news here on November 22nd, the day of JFK's assassination 38 years ago in 1963, you have articles like this one in New York Magazine.
[02:55:10.387 --> 02:55:11.647]  What killed JFK?
[02:55:12.028 --> 02:55:13.588]  Not who, but what.
[02:55:13.788 --> 02:55:21.110]  And people like Chris Matthews, who brought you the rise of the right wing and otherwise tried to demonize the severe right wing
[02:55:21.830 --> 02:55:25.851]  Let's cue some of that clip now.
[02:55:26.912 --> 02:55:30.293]  Let me finish tonight with this.
[02:55:30.373 --> 02:55:36.995]  On a Friday morning in the fall of 1963, an American president traveled through Texas trying to figure the state out.
[02:55:37.455 --> 02:55:39.095]  What made Dallas so right-wing?
[02:55:39.135 --> 02:55:42.757]  He kept asking the two men in the car with him that drizzly Friday morning in November.
[02:55:43.237 --> 02:55:45.117]  Why were they attacking him as a traitor?
[02:55:45.437 --> 02:55:47.018]  Why were they spitting on his people?
[02:55:47.558 --> 02:55:52.122]  One of his hosts, Congressman Jim Wright of Fort Worth, laid it out on the right-wing press in Dallas.
[02:55:52.523 --> 02:55:57.828]  Governor John Connally, the other politician in the car with him, the visiting president, chalked it up to the economy.
[02:55:58.248 --> 02:56:08.138]  Unlike a city like Fort Worth, a city of stockyards and factory floors, where the visiting president had just gotten warmly cheered, the city of Dallas was filled with white-collar office buildings.
[02:56:08.178 --> 02:56:11.421]  People there all wanted to make it to the higher floor, wanted to move up.
[02:56:11.861 --> 02:56:13.602]  To their insurance and financial companies.
[02:56:13.862 --> 02:56:15.924]  They were voting the way their bosses voted.
[02:56:16.024 --> 02:56:18.305]  Voting their aspirations to get to the next floor.
[02:56:18.725 --> 02:56:21.787]  Who knows what makes one city so different from another politically?
[02:56:22.248 --> 02:56:24.469]  Jack Kennedy was just trying to sort it all out that morning.
[02:56:24.529 --> 02:56:26.811]  He was living the life of an American politician.
[02:56:27.131 --> 02:56:29.052]  Trying to figure things out politically.
[02:56:29.132 --> 02:56:34.936]  Trying to figure out what was in the water down there in Dallas that made some people so viciously right-wing.
[02:56:35.556 --> 02:56:53.884]  Okay, there you have it and the insinuation that it was something in the water that made people so viciously right-wing and this is just more of the talking point using JFK as a bouncing board for the larger attempt to demonize free speech and try to pin a lot of the extremist action on the rhetoric
[02:56:54.404 --> 02:56:55.425]  Uh, from various circles.
[02:56:55.445 --> 02:57:00.708]  You've seen it most recently with this accused White House shooter saying he viewed the Obama deception.
[02:57:00.748 --> 02:57:01.548]  That motivated him.
[02:57:01.849 --> 02:57:07.552]  You saw similar attempts with Jared Lee Loeffner and, uh, that guy, Poplowski, and a whole lot more.
[02:57:07.712 --> 02:57:11.835]  And Chris Matthews has really been, uh, one of the central people on that theme.
[02:57:11.875 --> 02:57:15.377]  Never mind the involvement of the CIA or all the unexplained questions.
[02:57:15.857 --> 02:57:18.719]  It was the general hatred in the population of Dallas.
[02:57:19.379 --> 02:57:26.205]  No, obviously there was a different kind of conspiracy going on there, although those factors were in place as well, but it's a complicated world.
[02:57:26.505 --> 02:57:27.305]  You also have Will...
[02:57:28.314 --> 02:57:33.759]  Louis Freeh, the former FBI Director, bungled the Penn State child sex abuse investigation.
[02:57:34.120 --> 02:57:44.650]  Very interesting because of his role in the FBI during Clinton's second term, all the things he helped cover up from Waco to Ruby Ridge on down, or allegedly helped to cover up.
[02:57:45.130 --> 02:57:50.776]  And it's interesting because you see in things like the Bill Clinton-Monica Lewinsky scandal, people like
[02:57:52.057 --> 02:57:54.320]  Well, what was that guy's name who did the investigation?
[02:57:54.361 --> 02:58:00.650]  Kenneth Starr, a big Bohemian Grove family who goes there with other candidates like Newt Gingrich.
[02:58:01.551 --> 02:58:06.739]  Is there political sabotage going on behind these investigations and will they ever uncover the truth?
[02:58:07.299 --> 02:58:09.121]  Well, I for one am not going to hold my breath.
[02:58:09.501 --> 02:58:15.125]  Also interesting, the rise of computerized contact lenses that will keep you up to date with news and text.
[02:58:15.445 --> 02:58:19.709]  Your iPhone will display text and imagery on new contacts.
[02:58:19.789 --> 02:58:21.610]  More of the coming Technocratic Society.
[02:58:21.910 --> 02:58:23.371]  That's all the time we have today.
[02:58:23.431 --> 02:58:24.772]  Stay tuned for rebroadcast.
[02:58:25.093 --> 02:58:29.696]  And tonight, special coverage of Ron Paul's rise in the polls on the InfoWars Nightly News.
