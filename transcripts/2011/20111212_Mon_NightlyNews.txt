[00:00:22.162 --> 00:00:29.506]  Good evening and welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to this Monday, December 12, 2011 broadcast of the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:29.526 --> 00:00:30.726]  I'm Aaron Dykes.
[00:00:30.786 --> 00:00:35.208]  Now, coming up in this broadcast, we have a very special interview with pharmacist Ben Fuchs.
[00:00:35.588 --> 00:00:42.212]  He's going to give you a wealth of information on nutrition and vitamin supplements and how you can improve your health.
[00:00:42.572 --> 00:00:43.812]  It's such an extended interview.
[00:00:43.832 --> 00:00:48.535]  We have a part two also coming up later this week, but first, in the news,
[00:00:49.715 --> 00:01:04.784]  It has come to the surface that the very controversial National Defense Authorization Act, well, is even worse because of who was behind the terrible language in the bill, which was written by Carl Levin, Senator, as well as John McCain, Senator.
[00:01:05.164 --> 00:01:08.987]  The Obama Administration demanded power to indefinitely detain U.S.
[00:01:09.727 --> 00:01:10.267]  citizens.
[00:01:10.668 --> 00:01:15.771]  It was the White House who removed language that would have protected Americans from Section 1031 of the NDAA Bill.
[00:01:18.172 --> 00:01:33.102]  Section 1031 of the NDAA Bill, which itself defines the entirety of the United States as a battlefield, allows American citizens to be snatched from the streets, carted off to a foreign detention camp, and held indefinitely without trial.
[00:01:33.162 --> 00:01:36.705]  The Bill states that any person who has committed a belligerent act
[00:01:37.065 --> 00:01:41.327]  Faces indefinite detention, but no trial evidence has to be presented.
[00:01:41.347 --> 00:01:47.930]  The White House merely needs to make the accusation totally in violation of due process and everything in the Bill of the Rights.
[00:01:49.091 --> 00:01:57.394]  The article goes on to discuss how it was the administration that asked us to remove the very language which we had in the bill, which passed the committee.
[00:01:57.694 --> 00:02:00.416]  We removed it at the request of the administration.
[00:02:00.456 --> 00:02:05.178]  That's Senator Carl Levin talking, and now we have a video clip of him saying the same.
[00:02:06.897 --> 00:02:33.409]  I'm wondering whether the Senator is familiar with the fact that the language, the language which precluded the application of Section 1031 to American citizens was in the bill that we originally approved in the Armed Services Committee and the administration asked us to remove the language which says that U.S.
[00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:34.990]  citizens and lawful residents
[00:02:36.098 --> 00:02:37.879]  Would not be subject to this section.
[00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:57.869]  Is the Senator familiar with the fact that it was the administration that asked us to remove the very language which we had in the bill which passed the committee and that we removed it at the request of the administration that would have said that this determination would not apply to U.S.
[00:02:57.909 --> 00:02:59.230]  citizens and lawful residents?
[00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:05.673]  I'm just wondering, is the Senator familiar with the fact that it was the administration which asked us to remove the very language
[00:03:06.826 --> 00:03:11.708]  The absence of which is now objected to by the Senator from Illinois.
[00:03:11.908 --> 00:03:15.290]  I'm familiar now because the Senator from Michigan has shared that fact with me.
[00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:22.113]  And so again, that's legislation that would have, at least in the language, protected American citizens from this indefinite detention.
[00:03:22.773 --> 00:03:25.735]  And Levin says it was the White House who asked him to remove it.
[00:03:26.055 --> 00:03:35.478]  This is a part of a larger problem because so much of the secret junk that goes on is cloaked under national security which is all part of the executive branch overreach.
[00:03:35.538 --> 00:03:37.458]  It's been going on through many presidents.
[00:03:37.778 --> 00:03:39.919]  George W. Bush, chief among them.
[00:03:40.279 --> 00:03:42.099]  Obama's a big part of that problem as well.
[00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:43.460]  I wanted to read this paragraph.
[00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:51.682]  The Obama administration never had a problem with section 1031 of the bill and indeed acted to ensure it applied to American citizens.
[00:03:52.222 --> 00:04:04.653]  Doubts over whether or not Obama would veto the bill only arose out of issues with Section 1032, not the same section, which pertains to the military being required to take custody of individuals.
[00:04:05.053 --> 00:04:12.320]  So if Obama vetoes the very large NDAA National Defense Authorization Package,
[00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:21.668]  It may well be because of the issue with Section 1032 and not with Section 1031, the controversial section talking about indefinite detention of Americans.
[00:04:22.048 --> 00:04:32.197]  So we're going to look out for a possible stunt, a switcheroo, making your cake and eating it too, having your cake and eating it too, something to watch, and other terrible news.
[00:04:32.637 --> 00:04:37.825]  The Internet Piracy Bill, a freedoms of speech kill switch, that's in the Hill today.
[00:04:38.626 --> 00:04:40.008]  They talk about how the U.S.
[00:04:40.068 --> 00:04:47.819]  Justice Department, under the Stop Online Piracy Act, could shut down any Internet site it doesn't like on nothing more than a whim.
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:05:03.425]  Under the so-called Stop Online Piracy Act, SOPA, the federal government, which is prohibited constitutionally from abridging free speech or depriving its citizens of their property without due process, would engage in both practices on an unprecedented scale.
[00:05:03.945 --> 00:05:04.125]  Yeah.
[00:05:20.327 --> 00:05:20.828]  I don't know.
[00:05:38.746 --> 00:05:45.188]  Has been warning about the internet kill switch bills that the Senate and others have tried to introduce for years.
[00:05:45.268 --> 00:05:51.529]  Paul Joseph Watson wrote the Senate to sneak through internet kill switch bill back in August 26th of 2010.
[00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:55.731]  He also wrote about it in June 25th of 2010.
[00:05:56.331 --> 00:06:00.592]  Obama could shut down the internet for four months under new emergency powers.
[00:06:01.292 --> 00:06:04.333]  A new bill gives Obama kill switch to shut down the internet.
[00:06:04.353 --> 00:06:06.734]  That's Paul Joseph Watson in June of 2010 also.
[00:06:08.494 --> 00:06:09.896]  And a whole lot more.
[00:06:09.956 --> 00:06:22.128]  The point is they're going to use these claims of copyright infringement to protect the music and movie industries and the rest of it, to shut down what ultimately will amount to, and I assure you of this, political speech.
[00:06:22.208 --> 00:06:23.509]  This website's under threat.
[00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:29.335]  Every website, especially where it values freedom, is completely under threat by this awful legislation.
[00:06:29.855 --> 00:06:33.796]  Now, you heard about the EAS emergency alerts.
[00:06:34.136 --> 00:06:38.317]  The government did a test on TV and radio last month in October.
[00:06:38.637 --> 00:06:44.158]  They also announced they want to soon do them on internet and cell phones.
[00:06:44.218 --> 00:06:47.439]  Verizon was the first cell phone network to sign up for that.
[00:06:47.739 --> 00:06:52.340]  And here it is, unannounced Verizon emergency alert causes panic in New Jersey.
[00:06:52.780 --> 00:07:08.247]  An unannounced test of soon-to-be mandatory emergency alert system caused panic in New Jersey after Verizon customers received text messages warning them that a civil emergency was in progress and to take shelter, prompting alarm and a flood of 911 calls.
[00:07:10.683 --> 00:07:12.945]  And it goes on to discuss all the chaos from there.
[00:07:12.965 --> 00:07:15.008]  It was almost certainly a government message.
[00:07:15.388 --> 00:07:23.296]  In fact, the exact wording that Verizon cell phone customers received was, civil emergency in this area until 124 Eastern.
[00:07:23.637 --> 00:07:24.518]  Take shelter now.
[00:07:24.658 --> 00:07:24.998]  U.S.
[00:07:25.098 --> 00:07:25.399]  govern.
[00:07:26.783 --> 00:07:27.263]  We're good to go.
[00:07:53.747 --> 00:07:54.407]  We're good to go.
[00:08:16.095 --> 00:08:16.295]  I think?
[00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:34.432]  You know, set his little reasons about it's only a state of mind.
[00:08:35.192 --> 00:08:57.424]  Now they're discussing in the Daily Caller how Holder may be holding onto private emails about Fast and Furious, a largely overlooked exchange from Thursday's House Judiciary Committee includes what appears to be an admission from Attorney General Eric Holder that emails to and from him about Operation Fast and Furious may exist and that he's refusing to provide them to Congress.
[00:08:58.244 --> 00:09:02.826]  Just more reason he should be further questioned, fired, and probably prosecuted.
[00:09:03.166 --> 00:09:09.769]  Meanwhile, Attorney General Eric Holder is coming here to Austin, Texas, where we broadcast from.
[00:09:09.789 --> 00:09:18.353]  And Kurt Nimmo has written an article urging people to protest his appearance at the LBJ Library in Austin at their main auditorium there.
[00:09:18.373 --> 00:09:19.734]  It holds several thousand.
[00:09:19.754 --> 00:09:21.875]  It's apparently by invitation only.
[00:09:21.895 --> 00:09:27.117]  And he cites how Holder had a significant role in the Waco siege
[00:09:27.817 --> 00:09:35.583]  In the bombing of the Oklahoma City building and all the rest of it, all the nasty stuff he's been involved in.
[00:09:35.603 --> 00:09:37.844]  That's right, it's not just Fast and Furious.
[00:09:38.184 --> 00:09:43.288]  These criminals have a total track record and that's why they're tapped time and again for government.
[00:09:43.608 --> 00:09:50.513]  That article, of course, up on Infowars.com if you're in the Austin area and want to show Holder what you think, peaceably, of course.
[00:09:52.062 --> 00:09:53.642]  And they will try to frame you and arrest you.
[00:09:53.662 --> 00:09:55.003]  We've all been through that as well.
[00:09:55.423 --> 00:09:58.364]  TSA recruiting junior officers at airports.
[00:09:59.024 --> 00:10:04.526]  At any rate, they have a fake TSA badge that says junior officer that they're giving out to kids.
[00:10:04.566 --> 00:10:06.706]  We got this tip from one of our great readers.
[00:10:07.306 --> 00:10:12.228]  And remember when you were growing up and wanted to be a police officer, firefighter, or public servant?
[00:10:12.568 --> 00:10:16.269]  Now the TSA appears to be tapping children for future recruits.
[00:10:17.009 --> 00:10:28.957]  Not only are young, impressable flyers indoctrinated by the unconstitutional checkpoints themselves, but now by a subtle driver to join the team when they could someday get the power to conduct their own pat-downs and body scans.
[00:10:29.537 --> 00:10:31.218]  Just crazy what this world's coming to.
[00:10:31.838 --> 00:10:41.664]  Now, on the climate gate front, we've covered the meeting in South Africa in Durban, where they're trying to set up essentially a climate debt system.
[00:10:42.725 --> 00:10:56.911]  Now, Mark Morano, we've had him on the program from Climate Depot, writes that the South African activist has slammed the UN's Green Climate Fund as government-to-government aid is a reward for being better than anyone else and causing poverty.
[00:10:56.931 --> 00:10:59.833]  It enriches the people who cause poverty.
[00:11:00.553 --> 00:11:08.717]  And he cites an activist by the name of Leon Liu, who said the UN Climate Fund will wreak havoc on the developing world's poor.
[00:11:09.137 --> 00:11:18.381]  Liu explained, the money goes to government, and governments spend it on, of course, themselves, meaning various government projects, creating bigger departments, bigger bureaucracies.
[00:11:18.741 --> 00:11:20.602]  It's called big bureaucratic capture.
[00:11:20.642 --> 00:11:24.804]  They build empires, they build conference centers, and they buy political support.
[00:11:24.844 --> 00:11:29.086]  They go and distribute the money to communities where they want support and votes.
[00:11:29.446 --> 00:11:40.829]  Not only is the whole climate change issue a concocted fraud for greater world government control, but of course it's a fraud anyway for bureaucracy, for bad spending, all the stuff everyone's so upset about.
[00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:46.951]  Obviously if they create a giant fund they're just going to embezzle it and misappropriate it and so forth.
[00:11:47.431 --> 00:11:55.014]  But of course the real reason we cover this story, awesome footage of leading climate gate critic Lord Monckton arriving at
[00:11:55.774 --> 00:11:58.115]  The South Durban Conference via parachute.
[00:11:58.355 --> 00:11:59.055]  Isn't this great?
[00:11:59.616 --> 00:12:00.516]  How old is he again?
[00:12:00.576 --> 00:12:01.036]  I forget.
[00:12:01.516 --> 00:12:06.198]  He's up there in age, though, and there he is having the time of his life and going to fight tyranny.
[00:12:06.639 --> 00:12:07.559]  Good for Lord Monckton.
[00:12:07.779 --> 00:12:09.400]  Really interesting guy to meet as well.
[00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:11.621]  Durban jump for climate truth.
[00:12:11.681 --> 00:12:20.084]  There he is with a tandem instructor, I would imagine, landing near the site of the conference where all the climate change people bring in their propaganda.
[00:12:20.124 --> 00:12:23.486]  So why shouldn't Monckton make a spectacle for truth?
[00:12:24.898 --> 00:12:25.539]  Yeah, pretty neat.
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:38.032]  In other news, Rand Paul is now criticizing the leading, or what the media tells us, are the leading GOP potential nominees, Gingrich and Romney, saying they're not conservative.
[00:12:38.052 --> 00:12:41.216]  Of course, Rand Paul's father, Ron Paul, who's running for the
[00:12:41.516 --> 00:12:42.016]  I don't think so.
[00:13:01.264 --> 00:13:01.564]  I think?
[00:13:31.084 --> 00:13:32.104]  I don't think so.
[00:14:01.455 --> 00:14:03.296]  People had their money in MF Global.
[00:14:03.336 --> 00:14:06.477]  Of course, it's happening worldwide, and I'm sure this is just the beginning.
[00:14:06.497 --> 00:14:18.721]  Of course, Latvia always has had problems, as I mentioned, but Norway, traditionally a very rich country, however, its butter shortage threatens Christmas treats, reads the headline in the AFP.
[00:14:19.041 --> 00:14:28.064]  An acute butter shortage in Norway, one of the world's richest countries, has left people worrying how to bake their Christmas goodies with store shelves emptied and prices through the roof.
[00:14:28.624 --> 00:14:34.125]  Now this is just an example of what happens when there is a food shortage crisis.
[00:14:34.505 --> 00:14:45.928]  The price of a pound of butter went up to 350 euros, which is more than $460 US, and people were bidding on it on the black and gray markets as well.
[00:14:46.348 --> 00:14:50.709]  Just something to keep in mind as the crisis exacerbates.
[00:14:51.089 --> 00:14:56.351]  Meanwhile, the Washington Post reports in its Wonkbook blog that the real unemployment rate is 11%
[00:14:58.496 --> 00:15:06.861]  And they go on to give their reasons that since 2007, the percent of the population that either has a job or is actively looking for one has fallen from 62.7% to 58.5%.
[00:15:07.942 --> 00:15:12.245]  That's millions of workers leaving the workforce.
[00:15:12.285 --> 00:15:15.527]  It's not because they become sick or old or infirm.
[00:15:15.567 --> 00:15:18.409]  That's because they can't find a job, so they stop trying.
[00:15:19.109 --> 00:15:32.619]  But then it goes on after saying that the quote real unemployment rate is 11% to explain how the real on and under employment rate is measured by the U6 graph and it's nearly 20%.
[00:15:32.999 --> 00:15:37.863]  You can see it in better detail here at Shadow Government Statistics.
[00:15:38.303 --> 00:15:45.508]  They've got a chart showing the official, that is the ones you see in headlines, the official U3 headlines.
[00:15:46.969 --> 00:15:50.631]  Way down here at the just over 5%, hovering up towards 10%.
[00:15:51.932 --> 00:16:02.437]  But that the U6 has consistently been well above 10% since 2008, well in excess of 15% since 2008, on to now.
[00:16:02.798 --> 00:16:07.380]  And then how the SGS alternative shows even higher unemployment, over 20%.
[00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:14.164]  That's when you factor in all the people who stopped looking for work and a lot of other factors, a way that they measured it
[00:16:14.964 --> 00:16:15.485]  I don't know.
[00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:38.263]  August 26th of this year, the Federal Reserve official in Atlanta, Chief Dennis Lockhart, said the real unemployment rate was 16%.
[00:16:39.084 --> 00:16:46.907]  Just more confirmation that the 8% number, 9% number, 10% number you see is all just a concocted joke.
[00:16:46.927 --> 00:16:50.808]  They've got another article here in MoneyCentralMSN.com.
[00:16:51.108 --> 00:16:52.169]  Real unemployment rate 16.6%.
[00:16:52.209 --> 00:16:54.750]  That was in 2010, but really things haven't improved.
[00:16:58.011 --> 00:16:59.533]  You've seen the numbers move just slightly.
[00:16:59.993 --> 00:17:05.438]  Anyway, we'll be back in just a moment with a very powerful interview from Ben Fuchs.
[00:17:05.478 --> 00:17:06.218]  He's a pharmacist.
[00:17:06.238 --> 00:17:09.001]  You can hear him on the GCN Live Network.
[00:17:09.581 --> 00:17:16.007]  He's also behind the Longevity Vitamin Supplements that Alex promotes at InfoWarsTeam.com.
[00:17:16.067 --> 00:17:17.248]  I've taken these myself.
[00:17:17.568 --> 00:17:18.569]  They can help you lose weight.
[00:17:18.589 --> 00:17:21.391]  They can help you fix all kinds of health problems.
[00:17:22.052 --> 00:17:24.254]  Just check out the basic Alex Team Pack.
[00:17:24.654 --> 00:17:24.894]  Thank you.
[00:17:41.613 --> 00:17:43.594]  What's up with these sorry politicians?
[00:17:43.835 --> 00:17:47.517]  Lots of bark, but when it's showtime, whimpering like little shih tzus.
[00:17:47.797 --> 00:17:48.938]  You want big cuts?
[00:17:49.238 --> 00:17:51.179]  Ron Paul's been screaming it for years.
[00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:52.260]  Budget crisis?
[00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:53.141]  No problem.
[00:17:53.381 --> 00:17:54.922]  Got a trillion bucks year one.
[00:17:55.122 --> 00:17:58.164]  That's trillion with a T. Department of Education?
[00:17:58.404 --> 00:17:58.805]  Gone.
[00:17:59.085 --> 00:18:01.246]  Interior, Energy, HUD, Commerce?
[00:18:01.466 --> 00:18:01.827]  Gone.
[00:18:02.207 --> 00:18:03.448]  Later bureaucrats.
[00:18:03.708 --> 00:18:05.589]  That's how Ron Paul rolls.
[00:18:05.989 --> 00:18:07.090]  Want to train the swamp?

[00:18:59.093 --> 00:19:11.285]  Now we're joined by pharmacist Ben Fuchs for really an extended interview into everything about health and how really you can solve your own issues just by learning about nutrition and taking it into account.
[00:19:11.525 --> 00:19:12.546]  Thanks for joining us, Ben.
[00:19:12.566 --> 00:19:13.167]  Thank you for having me.
[00:19:13.187 --> 00:19:13.988]  I like the way you said that.
[00:19:14.028 --> 00:19:15.349]  We can solve our own issues.
[00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:19.433]  Do you ever hear that book, The Constitution of No Authority by Lysander Spooner?
[00:19:20.114 --> 00:19:28.922]  Well, Alexander Spooner was a lawyer in the 1800s, and he wrote a book called The Constitution of No Authority, and his whole take was that we have to abolish authority.
[00:19:29.182 --> 00:19:31.163]  And he was talking about it from a political standpoint.
[00:19:31.544 --> 00:19:32.905]  I'm talking about it from a health standpoint.
[00:19:32.945 --> 00:19:39.531]  I mean, the word authority always troubled me, because the word authority contains the precursor, author.
[00:19:40.171 --> 00:19:43.694]  So when somebody's an authority, that means they're writing your story.
[00:19:44.175 --> 00:19:44.355]  Right.
[00:19:44.915 --> 00:19:45.756]  I hate authority.
[00:19:45.836 --> 00:19:47.357]  I don't want anybody writing my story.
[00:19:47.477 --> 00:19:52.600]  We can write our own story and nothing is more important when it comes to writing our own story than writing our own story about our health.
[00:19:54.047 --> 00:19:55.908]  So, why don't you give us some of the basics here?
[00:19:55.928 --> 00:19:56.348]  Okay, cool.
[00:19:56.928 --> 00:19:59.030]  Well, one of the things I like to do is simplify things.
[00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:02.052]  In pharmacy school, we always learn how to educate the public.
[00:20:02.552 --> 00:20:05.314]  Think about it, the most trusted profession every year is the pharmacist.
[00:20:05.334 --> 00:20:05.934]  And why is that?
[00:20:05.994 --> 00:20:18.722]  It's because we're trained in taking very complicated information about medicine, information that people really don't have a lot of, don't really understand, and simplifying it and making it more palatable, making it bite-sized for people to grasp.
[00:20:19.042 --> 00:20:20.043]  Well, I do that with nutrition.
[00:20:20.663 --> 00:20:20.983]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:20:42.389 --> 00:20:47.196]  Carbohydrates, fiber, water, vitamins, minerals and trace nutrients.
[00:20:47.256 --> 00:20:50.661]  The first five chapters I call macro nutrients.
[00:20:50.982 --> 00:20:52.143]  These are nutrients you need a lot of.
[00:20:52.644 --> 00:20:57.551]  The last three chapters are trace nutrients like the pixie dust that activates the macro nutrients.
[00:20:58.072 --> 00:21:01.975]  So when it comes to the eight chapters of good nutrition, how do you incorporate that into your lifestyle?
[00:21:01.995 --> 00:21:05.057]  How do you incorporate it into your lifestyle in an easy way, in a manageable way?
[00:21:05.077 --> 00:21:06.719]  So take chapter one, protein.
[00:21:07.219 --> 00:21:10.482]  Your needs for protein are unspeakably huge.
[00:21:10.602 --> 00:21:16.266]  The average person needs somewhere around half a gram to a gram of protein per pound of body weight.
[00:21:16.746 --> 00:21:24.753]  So you weigh, say, 150 pounds, you're looking at 75 grams to 150 grams of protein if you want to be optimally healthy from a protein standpoint.
[00:21:25.333 --> 00:21:27.153]  How are you going to get 150 grams of protein?
[00:21:27.354 --> 00:21:29.534]  An egg has around 7 grams of protein.
[00:21:29.554 --> 00:21:33.215]  So you're looking, right away, you're looking at 20 eggs just to get your protein from eggs.
[00:21:33.735 --> 00:21:40.737]  From steak or from hamburger, you cook your protein, you don't even really know what you're getting, but it's very difficult to get those kinds of quantities.
[00:21:41.117 --> 00:21:50.259]  In order to effectively and manageably get 150, 75, 150 grams of protein if you weigh 150 pounds, the only way to do it is to supplement.
[00:21:50.839 --> 00:21:51.119]  I think so.
[00:22:08.342 --> 00:22:08.462]  Yeah.
[00:22:28.414 --> 00:22:32.455]  I mean, people probably know about whey from weight lifting and that kind of thing.
[00:22:32.495 --> 00:22:32.835]  Exactly!
[00:22:55.241 --> 00:23:04.572]  Yes, I'll tell you why number one if a bodybuilder an athlete is doing something we should all be doing it because Just getting your butt out of bed in the morning is an athletic event.
[00:23:04.952 --> 00:23:16.925]  Just getting through your day is Contains an athletic component just to function in your day so if an athlete is doing something for their performance you want to think of yourself as an athlete of life and
[00:23:17.045 --> 00:23:17.345]  I think so.
[00:23:38.181 --> 00:23:38.401]  Yeah.
[00:23:55.791 --> 00:23:56.231]  I think so.
[00:24:15.718 --> 00:24:16.798]  Some people have a problem with dairy.
[00:24:17.079 --> 00:24:18.559]  If that's the case, you have two options.
[00:24:18.959 --> 00:24:30.424]  You can use digestive enzymes, which will sometimes get you around the problem with the allergens in whey protein, or you can use some more exotic forms of whey protein that are more heavily processed.
[00:24:30.444 --> 00:24:35.886]  Now, you lose some of the value of the whey protein, but it might be easier for somebody to handle if they have allergies, milk allergies.
[00:24:35.926 --> 00:24:40.188]  The second thing you can do is you can go into alternative sources of protein, and there's many.
[00:24:41.068 --> 00:24:43.329]  Egg protein is an alternative source of protein.
[00:24:44.069 --> 00:24:44.730]  I think so.
[00:25:06.053 --> 00:25:11.094]  Whether that processing involves chopping, or dicing, or freezing, or boiling, whatever that processing is.
[00:25:11.394 --> 00:25:14.735]  And whenever you process a food, you lose the nutritional value.
[00:25:14.775 --> 00:25:19.596]  The beautiful thing about whey protein is you don't have to process it, or protein powders, is you don't have to process it.
[00:25:19.616 --> 00:25:20.796]  You just add it into water and drink it.
[00:25:21.176 --> 00:25:22.136]  By the way, I'm a bachelor.
[00:25:22.476 --> 00:25:24.957]  I don't really have time to cook or the inclination to cook.
[00:25:25.217 --> 00:25:28.678]  So one of the neat things about whey protein is, you put it in water, you drink it.
[00:25:28.738 --> 00:25:31.618]  Or you put it in your blender and you throw a few other things in, and you drink it.
[00:25:31.918 --> 00:25:35.219]  One dish to wash, no muss, no fuss, you're well-nutriented.
[00:25:35.979 --> 00:25:43.641]  That's one of the neat things about supplementing is it's brain fart free.
[00:25:43.941 --> 00:25:45.462]  Brain damage free.
[00:25:45.542 --> 00:25:46.502]  It's easy to do.
[00:25:46.522 --> 00:25:48.503]  You just add the stuff to water and you drink it.
[00:25:48.743 --> 00:25:55.365]  And that's one of the neat things about nutritional supplements as well is you can get your nutrients without having to waste a lot of time in the kitchen.
[00:25:55.745 --> 00:25:59.346]  As far as food goes, that's a whole other story because I think foods are very important.
[00:25:59.806 --> 00:26:02.947]  But the less work you give your digestive system,
[00:26:03.487 --> 00:26:08.009]  The less work you give your digestive system, the longer you will live.
[00:26:08.109 --> 00:26:16.612]  So the key to longevity and the key to health and wellness is to figure out a way to get lots of nutrients without lots of calories.
[00:26:17.092 --> 00:26:19.973]  Calories represent heat and calories represent work.
[00:26:20.594 --> 00:26:23.055]  Nutrients are in a way, they're the opposite.
[00:26:23.335 --> 00:26:26.216]  Because your body doesn't have to work, the body actually gets work.
[00:26:26.616 --> 00:26:27.056]  We're good to go!
[00:26:53.872 --> 00:26:56.733]  Your brain is constantly reading the blood.
[00:26:56.833 --> 00:26:57.853]  So your brain's in the dark.
[00:26:57.913 --> 00:26:58.534]  It's in your head.
[00:26:58.574 --> 00:26:59.974]  It doesn't know what's outside there.
[00:27:00.834 --> 00:27:04.436]  The only way it knows what's in the outside world is by reading the blood that's passing through it.
[00:27:05.076 --> 00:27:11.038]  So your brain is constantly scanning the blood for specific nutrients to determine whether you're hungry or not.
[00:27:11.518 --> 00:27:15.699]  And when it sees those nutrients, those specific nutrients, it sends the message, hey, we don't need to eat.
[00:27:15.719 --> 00:27:17.640]  In other words, it shuts down the appetite.
[00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:24.228]  On the other hand, when it's missing those nutrients, it says, go get some food, we're missing nutrients.
[00:27:24.649 --> 00:27:34.242]  Well the key nutrients that the brain is looking for to determine appetite, or lack thereof, is tryptophan, which is a very important amino acid, you can think of it like a protein, and glutamine.
[00:27:34.582 --> 00:27:34.802]  We're good!
[00:27:53.908 --> 00:27:54.789]  We're good to go!
[00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:28.181]  Back when we were paleological, when we lived on the African savanna, 50,000 years ago, tryptophan and glutamine meant we just killed a wildebeest, or we just killed a zebra.
[00:28:28.561 --> 00:28:32.145]  And it's summertime on the African savanna, and all is right in the world.
[00:28:32.405 --> 00:28:33.506]  So you don't have to go eat.
[00:28:33.546 --> 00:28:35.608]  Now we can take all that energy and we can put it into muscles.
[00:28:36.309 --> 00:28:50.982]  Conversely, when tryptophan levels are low, and glutamine levels are low, protein levels are low in the blood, the brain reads the blood, it sees the protein levels are low, the amino acid levels are low, the tryptophan and glutamine levels are low, guess what it does?
[00:28:51.582 --> 00:28:53.244]  It sends you out to go find food!
[00:28:53.264 --> 00:28:54.345]  Store up anything you can find.
[00:28:54.445 --> 00:28:54.725]  Sure!
[00:29:10.486 --> 00:29:10.746]  I think so.
[00:29:34.159 --> 00:29:39.023]  All those nutrients into building muscles so we can go out and hunt and do all the things human beings are supposed to do.
[00:29:39.584 --> 00:29:42.146]  Protein is a dieter's best friend.
[00:29:42.847 --> 00:29:43.848]  And I hate willpower.
[00:29:44.728 --> 00:29:45.769]  I don't have any willpower.
[00:29:45.809 --> 00:29:48.632]  And I don't believe dieting or good health should be a question of willpower.
[00:29:48.652 --> 00:29:52.475]  Because to me, willpower is this battle that's going on in your body.
[00:29:52.896 --> 00:29:53.816]  And that's not a good thing.
[00:29:53.836 --> 00:29:55.718]  You don't want to have a battle going on in your body.
[00:29:56.038 --> 00:29:59.882]  Good health should be as easy as a piece of ripe fruit just dropping off of a tree.
[00:30:00.282 --> 00:30:00.502]  I think so.
[00:30:20.074 --> 00:30:32.478]  But if you go to your party where there's going to be the birthday cake or the cherry pie and you go load it up on protein, it's going to be much easier to withstand the cravings and the urges and the drives, which are really hardwired in your interest.
[00:30:33.038 --> 00:30:34.039]  Your brain is in the dark.
[00:30:34.079 --> 00:30:37.040]  It doesn't know it's in the year 2011 in Austin, Texas.
[00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:40.181]  It thinks it's on the African savannah 50,000 years ago.
[00:30:40.521 --> 00:30:45.302]  So you have to give the brain what it needs in order to be happy on the African savannah 50,000 years ago.
[00:30:45.642 --> 00:30:46.743]  So protein is chapter one.
[00:30:47.463 --> 00:30:48.544]  Can I go on to continue this?
[00:30:48.564 --> 00:30:48.924]  Let's do it.
[00:30:48.984 --> 00:30:49.245]  Okay.
[00:30:49.565 --> 00:30:50.646]  Chapter 2 is fats.
[00:30:50.726 --> 00:30:59.373]  And just like protein is a dieter's best friend because it'll get you off the sugar, fat is a dieter's second best friend because it'll get you off the bad fat.
[00:30:59.653 --> 00:31:01.575]  The good fat will get you off the bad fat.
[00:31:02.035 --> 00:31:06.599]  Our body's need for protein is hardwired and our body's need for fat is hardwired as well.
[00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:07.961]  And if you are low fat,
[00:31:08.561 --> 00:31:08.761]  If you
[00:31:38.681 --> 00:31:39.982]  But it has to come from the outside.
[00:31:40.462 --> 00:31:45.066]  If you don't have enough essential fatty acids, whatever fat is sitting in front of you, you're going to go for it.
[00:31:45.246 --> 00:31:48.648]  Because your body's need for fat, like your body's need for protein, is hardwired.
[00:31:48.969 --> 00:31:51.531]  So if you want to get off the sugar, you go for the protein.
[00:31:51.791 --> 00:31:56.814]  If you want to get off the pizza, or you want to get off the french fries or the fat, go for essential fatty acids.
[00:31:56.875 --> 00:32:01.498]  Now, essential fatty acids, the role in the body, is tremendously, tremendously important.
[00:32:01.738 --> 00:32:06.362]  But one of the most important places where essential fatty acids play a role is they get converted
[00:32:07.102 --> 00:32:07.382]  I think so.
[00:32:22.972 --> 00:32:29.636]  Master Hormones regulate all the opening and closing of your body, all the opening and closing of blood vessels, nerves firing or not firing.
[00:32:29.956 --> 00:32:36.261]  Any kind of dynamic movement in the body is regulated by these Master Hormones which in turn come from essential fatty acids.
[00:32:36.641 --> 00:32:44.446]  There are many Americans who go cradle to grave without enough essential fatty acids because they're so difficult to find from food.
[00:32:44.946 --> 00:32:46.406]  If you're not supplementing, you're not getting them.
[00:32:46.747 --> 00:32:52.948]  You can almost one-to-one treat your fat cravings as deficiencies in essential fatty acids.
[00:32:53.329 --> 00:32:56.830]  So getting yourself on a good essential fatty acid is unbelievably important.
[00:32:56.850 --> 00:32:57.630]  There's two ways to do it.
[00:32:57.970 --> 00:32:59.210]  You can do it in liquid fashion.
[00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:00.631]  There's many brands of liquid.
[00:33:01.051 --> 00:33:04.632]  Or the easy way to do it is capsules, like the Young Jevy product, the ultimate EFAs.
[00:33:05.032 --> 00:33:08.153]  Take three capsules morning, three capsules afternoon, three capsules night.
[00:33:08.533 --> 00:33:13.755]  Now, one of the things that happens as we get older is we don't absorb our fats.
[00:33:14.295 --> 00:33:22.120]  And so many people are having problems not only getting essential fatty acids, but once they take their essential fatty acids, absorbing the essential fatty acids.
[00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:27.843]  So if you have a problem, then you're going to have to throw in some digestive enzymes or take your essential fatty acids with food.
[00:33:28.283 --> 00:33:35.588]  But other than that, as long as you don't have a digestive problem, taking essential fatty acids, generous amounts, maybe nine capsules a day,
[00:33:36.528 --> 00:33:36.869]  I think so.
[00:33:55.592 --> 00:34:00.154]  Get yourself maybe 9 or 12 essential fatty acids and take them all at once.
[00:34:00.394 --> 00:34:01.714]  Let them sit in your stomach for a little bit.
[00:34:01.734 --> 00:34:04.595]  Let the fats break out of the gel and go into your digestive system.
[00:34:05.175 --> 00:34:07.976]  And then, see if french fries sound good to you.
[00:34:08.476 --> 00:34:16.819]  And I guarantee you, once you get a big jolt of fat into your system, essential fatty acid fat, good fat, you will not be able to eat the french fries.
[00:34:17.119 --> 00:34:21.781]  Now, your body is constantly using essential fatty acids, so you're going to feel like french fries a few hours later.
[00:34:22.321 --> 00:34:31.147]  But just doing it one time will be enough of a demonstration to show you how powerful nutritional supplementation is for weaning yourself off of the crappy stuff.
[00:34:31.667 --> 00:34:35.930]  My favorite thing about essential fatty acids is it makes your skin nice and soft.
[00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:37.711]  I've been in the skin care business for a long time.
[00:34:38.272 --> 00:34:44.436]  One of the things about skin that most people don't recognize is your skin should never be dry.
[00:34:44.816 --> 00:34:45.677]  Let me tell you something.
[00:34:46.417 --> 00:34:50.520]  Almost everybody, almost everybody has a problem with dry skin.
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:54.783]  There are billions of dollars spent on moisturizers in this country which do nothing.
[00:34:55.583 --> 00:34:57.124]  Moisturizers don't moisturize the skin.
[00:34:57.164 --> 00:35:00.686]  They just wax a coating of wax or oil on top of your skin.
[00:35:01.407 --> 00:35:06.750]  But you should need a moisturizer because human skin is not supposed to be dry.
[00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:10.873]  As soon as you start taking essential fatty acids, you notice that your skin isn't as dry.
[00:35:11.273 --> 00:35:13.535]  The best thing about essential fatty acids for women
[00:35:14.275 --> 00:35:14.595]  I think so.
[00:35:37.077 --> 00:35:42.160]  When she takes a month off of her EFAs because she gets all cocky and says, I don't get cramps anymore, guess what?
[00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:44.621]  The cramps come back.
[00:35:44.661 --> 00:35:51.144]  That's how powerful the connection is between these physical manifestations of ill health and nutritional deficiencies.
[00:35:51.324 --> 00:35:52.284]  So these are hormonal.
[00:35:52.304 --> 00:35:54.005]  Does it work the same for men and women?
[00:35:54.065 --> 00:35:54.365]  Absolutely.
[00:35:54.385 --> 00:35:56.086]  Does it work in the right perspective ways?
[00:35:56.146 --> 00:35:56.707]  Heck yes!
[00:35:56.807 --> 00:35:57.787]  Men make hormones too.
[00:35:59.728 --> 00:36:00.728]  Here's how hormone works.
[00:36:01.508 --> 00:36:02.289]  You have a cell, right?
[00:36:02.369 --> 00:36:04.269]  Think of a little circle like you saw in biology class.
[00:36:04.289 --> 00:36:09.010]  It's not really a little circle, it's a blob, but think of the little circle like you saw in biology class.
[00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:12.311]  Your little circle on the outside of the cell has little spaces.
[00:36:12.491 --> 00:36:13.551]  Those are called receptors.
[00:36:14.252 --> 00:36:19.253]  And the way a hormone works is a hormone will sit in one of those spaces the way a plug sits in a socket.
[00:36:19.693 --> 00:36:21.413]  And it will cause a chemical reaction to happen.
[00:36:21.433 --> 00:36:22.414]  That's a little bit simplistic.
[00:36:22.434 --> 00:36:24.034]  There's a few other things that happen.
[00:36:24.094 --> 00:36:26.235]  But basically, a hormone is like a plug.
[00:36:26.475 --> 00:36:27.435]  It sits in a socket.
[00:36:28.075 --> 00:36:28.576]  That's great!
[00:36:50.196 --> 00:36:50.576]  I'm good to go!
[00:37:08.726 --> 00:37:14.150]  Thirdly, and this is very, very important, essential fatty acids are oxygen magnets.
[00:37:14.731 --> 00:37:17.252]  And this is why they're sitting in the outside part of the cell.
[00:37:17.593 --> 00:37:23.257]  Because as the essential fatty acid is sitting in the outside part of the cell, it's attracting oxygen to the cell.
[00:37:23.297 --> 00:37:24.438]  It's an oxygen magnet.
[00:37:25.258 --> 00:37:25.518]  I think so.
[00:37:40.626 --> 00:37:40.986]  I'm good to go!
[00:38:04.884 --> 00:38:05.184]  I think so.
[00:38:23.416 --> 00:38:28.720]  You've now lowered your sugar cravings, reduced your sugar cravings, reduced your cravings for fatty foods.
[00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:31.061]  Just the first two chapters you've lost weight.
[00:38:31.501 --> 00:38:32.602]  Just the first two chapters.
[00:38:33.002 --> 00:38:35.064]  And we haven't even got to chapter three, which is carbohydrates.
[00:38:35.124 --> 00:38:36.545]  Now, carbohydrates get a bad rap.
[00:38:36.785 --> 00:38:38.166]  Everybody wants to be on low-carb, right?
[00:38:38.586 --> 00:38:39.247]  Low-carb diets.
[00:38:40.342 --> 00:38:43.163]  You need more carbohydrates than you need any other food group.
[00:38:43.463 --> 00:38:50.105]  In fact, roughly 40% of your calories should come from carbohydrates.
[00:38:50.165 --> 00:39:02.350]  Everybody's going to be a little different, but the standard type of division of macronutrients are 40% carbohydrates, 30% protein, 30% fat.
[00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:03.510]  That's a good place to be.
[00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:05.971]  So most of your calories should come from carbohydrates.
[00:39:06.431 --> 00:39:06.671]  I think so.
[00:39:27.244 --> 00:39:27.664]  I think so.
[00:39:50.211 --> 00:39:50.532]  We're good.
[00:40:05.313 --> 00:40:11.576]  The first problem is a lot of the nutrients and vegetables that come with those carbohydrates are fatty and fat soluble.
[00:40:11.976 --> 00:40:21.319]  And if you have any problems with fat absorption, if you have any malabsorption issues, 30% of Americans have fat malabsorption problems, you're not going to get the benefits of those fatty nutrients.
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:29.743]  And those fatty nutrients are very protective from the sun and protective from toxicity in the environment.
[00:40:30.123 --> 00:40:30.723]  We're good to go!
[00:40:48.632 --> 00:40:49.232]  Thanks for watching.
[00:41:07.506 --> 00:41:13.629]  You always want to mix your vegetables with oil, and it's a good idea to slightly heat the vegetables in the oil.
[00:41:13.669 --> 00:41:15.950]  Not a lot of heat, but maybe slight steaming.
[00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:25.614]  What'll end up happening is the nutrients, the fatty nutrients that are in the Brussels sprouts and the broccoli and the cauliflower will come out in the oil and make it easier for your body to absorb.
[00:41:26.014 --> 00:41:33.798]  So Chapter 3 Carbohydrates should be mostly vegetables, as much as you can do vegetables, and it should be always mixed with fats.
[00:41:34.158 --> 00:41:34.318]  I think?
[00:41:51.138 --> 00:41:56.719]  Make bitter vegetables more palatable by slightly steaming them because you release the sugars in the vegetables.
[00:41:56.799 --> 00:42:01.780]  All vegetables have sugars in them, but they're tied up and you can't really taste them until you slightly steam them.
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:07.602]  That's why onions have almost a sugary sweet taste once you start to cook them, once you heat them a little bit.
[00:42:07.622 --> 00:42:10.782]  Same with Brussels sprouts and broccoli.
[00:42:10.822 --> 00:42:12.243]  So Chapter 3 is carbohydrates.
[00:42:12.703 --> 00:42:16.944]  Carbohydrates should form the bulk of your caloric intake, but they have to be balanced.
[00:42:18.344 --> 00:42:19.305]  Thank you for watching.
[00:42:33.331 --> 00:42:41.494]  Easy to absorb, it's all broken up and pre-digested, and you don't have to go through some of the digestive problems that are associated with vegetable intake.
[00:42:41.514 --> 00:42:51.218]  By the way, cabbages and cabbage juice is an amazing, amazing medicinal-like compound, medicinal-like food substance for the digestive system.
[00:42:51.458 --> 00:42:55.899]  If you have ulcers, if you have any kind of digestive problems, cabbage juice is amazing, amazing stuff.
[00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:57.340]  All vegetables are amazing.
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:04.062]  Cruciferous vegetables, broccoli, cauliflower, brussel sprouts are a woman's best friend because they're highly protective against female cancers.
[00:43:04.543 --> 00:43:06.543]  All those vegetables, cruciferous vegetables.
[00:43:07.024 --> 00:43:13.206]  But I want to get back to the modern day because there's so many processed foods and the kind of carbs everybody's been eating.
[00:43:13.226 --> 00:43:21.169]  I mean, I followed, yeah, like you said, the first two chapters of this, just going on the ways and the fats, and I personally have had a big transformation.
[00:43:22.089 --> 00:43:23.490]  Do you want to talk about that stuff right now?
[00:43:24.110 --> 00:43:28.113]  The kind of carbohydrates people are eating.
[00:43:28.133 --> 00:43:41.082]  Because you and I were talking off air about how our political system, our governmental system, the hierarchical system that lends itself to totalitarianism, is intimately connected with agriculture and farming.
[00:43:41.602 --> 00:43:47.967]  The first empire that we know of, the first empire in recorded history, was the Sumerian Empire, right?
[00:43:48.187 --> 00:43:49.988]  The Sumerian Empire appeared out of nowhere, by the way.
[00:43:50.188 --> 00:43:51.750]  That's a whole other story, how that happened.
[00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:54.613]  So the Sumerian Empire is the first empire in recorded history.
[00:43:55.013 --> 00:44:04.404]  And the Sumerian Empire became an empire because they were the first civilization that figured out how to farm and how to become big from farming.
[00:44:04.664 --> 00:44:09.569]  Now why is hegemony and tyranny related to agriculture and related to farming?
[00:44:09.590 --> 00:44:11.211]  Well, farming is a lot of work!
[00:44:11.952 --> 00:44:14.134]  And it's hard to get people to do a lot of work.
[00:44:14.234 --> 00:44:17.316]  Not only that, but irrigation requires ditch digging.
[00:44:17.717 --> 00:44:24.422]  And so people had to dig ditches and they're not... human beings aren't inclined to go dig ditches and to go farm if they don't have to.
[00:44:24.723 --> 00:44:26.764]  They had to be made to do that.
[00:44:27.085 --> 00:44:39.515]  So our political system of tyranny and our governmental system that's based on hierarchy and authority is intimately wed to this idea that people didn't want to farm, but they had to be compelled to farm.
[00:44:39.895 --> 00:44:40.235]  We're good to go.
[00:44:55.828 --> 00:45:00.810]  The individual's interest is to find good sources of food and go to those kinds of food.
[00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:07.091]  In the interest of the country, in the interest of the system, agriculture plays a big role.
[00:45:07.552 --> 00:45:15.654]  And so we find that wherever, as soon as agriculture came, that's when civilization came, and that's when government came, and that's when political tyranny came.
[00:45:15.834 --> 00:45:16.654]  Yeah, it's interesting.
[00:45:16.675 --> 00:45:20.537]  You always see in Egyptian hieroglyphs, for instance, they pay taxes in grain.
[00:45:20.617 --> 00:45:22.598]  Exactly, but who do they pay taxes to?
[00:45:23.438 --> 00:45:25.139]  Exactly, they pay taxes to the government.
[00:45:25.259 --> 00:45:26.540]  The individual didn't need it.
[00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:38.407]  The individual was fine going and hunting a zebra once in a while, but we got convinced into thinking that our lives would be better off if we were farming and we had food that was local and we didn't have to go out and hunt and forage for food.
[00:45:38.787 --> 00:45:45.631]  But our health began to decline as soon as we started to farm and our health didn't catch up until the turn of the 20th century when we got more protein in our diet.
[00:45:46.051 --> 00:45:54.917]  I don't know if I was telling you, I was telling somebody, in the Middle Ages, sometimes you go to a museum and they'll have little houses or little beds and show you how people lived in the Middle Ages.
[00:45:55.197 --> 00:46:03.402]  The beds were really small, the houses were really small, people were 4 foot 10 and 5 foot 2 and they only lived to be 20 years old in the Middle Ages.
[00:46:03.722 --> 00:46:08.445]  Our Cro-Magnon ancestors were big, strong, muscular people.
[00:46:09.065 --> 00:46:09.646]  We're good to go.
[00:46:28.707 --> 00:46:29.268]  Thank you.
[00:46:44.878 --> 00:46:54.625]  Yeah, why don't you talk about those Founding Fathers quotes, because I always think about what Henry Kissinger said, not only that food is a weapon, but that if you control the food, you control the population.
[00:46:54.645 --> 00:46:55.685]  Isn't that amazing?
[00:46:56.426 --> 00:47:01.049]  Yeah, not only does it go back to the history of agriculture, I mean it was part of the history of the Founding Fathers.
[00:47:01.069 --> 00:47:01.549]  That's right.
[00:47:01.589 --> 00:47:09.332]  Benjamin Rush and Thomas Jefferson, two of the founding fathers who signed the Declaration of Independence, warned against the centralization of medicine.
[00:47:09.392 --> 00:47:18.494]  Thomas Jefferson said, if you limit people's ability to access health freely of their own volition, deciding what they want to do themselves, then you can control the people.
[00:47:18.514 --> 00:47:19.755]  Can we pull up those quotes?
[00:47:20.235 --> 00:47:20.775]  Very interesting.
[00:47:20.795 --> 00:47:22.216]  And Benjamin Rush said the same thing.
[00:47:23.396 --> 00:47:24.676]  Benjamin Rush, by the way, is a physician.
[00:47:25.136 --> 00:47:25.397]  Yeah.
[00:47:25.477 --> 00:47:26.417]  And he warned about it.
[00:47:27.062 --> 00:47:28.342]  Here's that quote.
[00:47:28.943 --> 00:47:35.424]  Benjamin Rush, the Constitution of the Republic should make special provision for medical freedom.
[00:47:35.684 --> 00:47:37.405]  And he said this in 1787.
[00:47:37.445 --> 00:47:38.265]  This is amazing to me.
[00:47:38.525 --> 00:47:43.687]  To restrict the art of healing to one class will constitute the bestial of medical science.
[00:47:43.947 --> 00:47:46.307]  All such laws are un-American.
[00:47:46.347 --> 00:47:46.767]  He says this in 1787.
[00:47:46.827 --> 00:47:47.308]  This is amazing.
[00:47:48.968 --> 00:47:50.470]  And despotic.
[00:47:50.770 --> 00:48:02.244]  Unless we put medical freedom in the Constitution, the time will come when medicine will organize into an undercover dictatorship and force people who wish doctors a treatment of their own choice to submit to only what the dictating outfit offers.
[00:48:02.564 --> 00:48:04.927]  This is what managed healthcare is.
[00:48:05.128 --> 00:48:06.950]  Exactly what Benjamin Rush warned against.
[00:48:07.370 --> 00:48:15.899]  Managed healthcare is when you go to HMO and they select what kind of medicines you get based on what kind of illness you have, based on what the book tells you.
[00:48:15.939 --> 00:48:17.441]  And that's what Obamacare is, Aaron.
[00:48:17.761 --> 00:48:20.304]  This is the promise of Obamacare.
[00:48:20.424 --> 00:48:29.173]  Managed healthcare where you go into some kind of institution, you walk in there, the doctor takes your blood pressure, they look in a book to see what kind of
[00:48:30.054 --> 00:48:36.919]  Prescription should be dictated to you based on what your blood pressure reading is, based on what your cholesterol reading is, and you get that medicine.
[00:48:37.199 --> 00:48:51.108]  And by the way, that medicine is bought in bulk from some pharmaceutical company, and the HMO gets to buy it cheap if they agree to dispense just that brand for your particular illness.
[00:48:51.488 --> 00:48:58.877]  It's related to the same reason we see the FDA and the other entities trying to intimidate people for growing vegetables and selling raw milk.
[00:48:59.038 --> 00:48:59.959]  Or books!
[00:49:00.099 --> 00:49:02.582]  They burn books if the books say something that they shouldn't say.
[00:49:02.682 --> 00:49:05.085]  Well yeah, he talks too about locking up the medical knowledge.
[00:49:05.606 --> 00:49:07.388]  The alternative stuff we're trying to get out now.
[00:49:07.588 --> 00:49:08.529]  That's right, that's right.
[00:49:08.589 --> 00:49:09.509]  And you know what?
[00:49:09.810 --> 00:49:10.950]  That's what the Internet is about.
[00:49:10.970 --> 00:49:12.631]  We're so lucky for now.
[00:49:12.651 --> 00:49:18.776]  I don't know what's going to happen in the future, but for now, Aaron, gathering information is the most important thing you can do.
[00:49:18.796 --> 00:49:22.238]  The reason I do what I do is because I want people to have this kind of information.
[00:49:22.698 --> 00:49:32.445]  For the listeners, for people who are out there, there is nothing more important than gathering information about how we take care of our bodies and how we don't take care of our bodies.
[00:49:32.485 --> 00:49:36.828]  To me, our access to the Internet that we have for now is a gift from on high.
[00:49:37.578 --> 00:49:39.480]  Let's take a look at that Jefferson quote, too.
[00:49:40.981 --> 00:49:41.521]  Do we have that?
[00:49:42.902 --> 00:49:51.829]  If the people let the government decide what foods they eat and what medicines to take, their bodies will soon be in as sorry a state as are the souls of those who live under tyranny.
[00:49:51.849 --> 00:49:52.269]  Isn't that great?
[00:49:52.290 --> 00:49:59.975]  That's Thomas Jefferson, not sure on the year of that quote, but regardless, it's from the founding period, and that really is part of the fight.
[00:50:00.015 --> 00:50:07.221]  We're trying to have a revolution of the mind here, but that goes right along with the bodies, and that's what the Info War and the rest of it is all about.
[00:50:07.401 --> 00:50:09.022]  Well, info wars, information.
[00:50:09.042 --> 00:50:10.482]  That's exactly what that is.
[00:50:10.522 --> 00:50:13.523]  Now, personally, I'm a healthcare professional, so I focus on health.
[00:50:13.923 --> 00:50:20.885]  But I'm also involved, I follow what's going on politically, and I follow what's going on in terms of the New World Order, in terms of the centralization of power on all levels.
[00:50:21.465 --> 00:50:22.926]  But if we're sick, Aaron,
[00:50:23.386 --> 00:50:37.353]  If we have cancer, if we have colon problems or Crohn's disease, if we have autoimmune problems, or if we're just a slave to food where we can't stop eating, we will not have the wherewithal, we will not have the power, we will not have the strength to fight this new world order.
[00:50:38.814 --> 00:50:41.457]  To me, this is a precursor to the Great Battle.
[00:50:41.597 --> 00:50:46.824]  Taking care of your body, taking care of your health, disengaging from the foods they want you to eat.
[00:50:46.844 --> 00:50:53.012]  If somebody's singing a song to you about a food that you're supposed to go out and eat, that's a food you don't want to eat.
[00:50:53.533 --> 00:50:59.920]  If there's a commercial, if there's a jingle, if there's a model, if there's a little cartoon character, that is something you don't want to go near.
[00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:01.922]  And that's the kind of decisions we have to make.
[00:51:02.202 --> 00:51:04.465]  We're being manipulated through our food choices.
[00:51:04.865 --> 00:51:09.951]  So as an independent human being, as a free-thinking human being, it should be an insult
[00:51:10.171 --> 00:51:17.956]  To anybody who drives through the Golden Arches, or to go through Wendy's, or to eat that kind of food, because that's how we're being, that's how our power is being usurped from us.
[00:51:17.996 --> 00:51:19.757]  That's how we are being controlled.
[00:51:19.777 --> 00:51:24.520]  Through the water we're drinking, through the beverages we drink, through the foods we eat, and through the air we breathe.
[00:51:24.841 --> 00:51:33.966]  So personally, I consider it an insult to my intelligence to go through some kind of drive-thru to have a hamburger or french fries.
[00:51:34.047 --> 00:51:36.288]  I feel personally offended by somebody trying to sell me that.
[00:51:36.328 --> 00:51:39.870]  Well, they've taken all the psychology knowledge and used it against us.
[00:51:40.010 --> 00:51:40.550]  It's awful!
[00:51:40.590 --> 00:51:41.790]  From Maslow to... Bernays?
[00:51:41.810 --> 00:51:42.391]  You know about Edward Bernays?
[00:51:42.411 --> 00:51:43.311]  Yeah, Edward Bernays, exactly.
[00:51:43.331 --> 00:51:45.072]  Oh my God, the torches of freedom.
[00:51:45.092 --> 00:51:46.813]  Well, he was the nephew of Freud, so they apply that stuff.
[00:51:46.873 --> 00:51:47.153]  Exactly.
[00:51:47.173 --> 00:51:52.455]  Do you know Edward Bernays was hired by the Beech Nut Packing Company to get more sales for bacon?
[00:51:52.735 --> 00:51:55.737]  And he invented the bacon and egg breakfast that we all eat today.
[00:51:56.477 --> 00:51:57.137]  That's some good PR.
[00:51:57.237 --> 00:51:59.279]  I've seen that documentary, The Century of the Self.
[00:51:59.299 --> 00:52:00.059]  It's very interesting.
[00:52:00.099 --> 00:52:00.679]  Exactly.
[00:52:00.759 --> 00:52:02.180]  Edward Bernays knew all this stuff.
[00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:05.142]  That's when they started to figure that we can manipulate the mind.
[00:52:05.162 --> 00:52:08.304]  They didn't even know about the mind from a scientific perspective until Freud.
[00:52:08.724 --> 00:52:13.647]  Freud's big advance was he said that there's these unconscious drives that we have and those can be manipulated.
[00:52:14.027 --> 00:52:14.407]  I love this.
[00:52:14.507 --> 00:52:15.208]  There's a funny story.
[00:52:15.228 --> 00:52:19.550]  I think it was in that Century of the Self video with the cake mix.
[00:52:19.590 --> 00:52:20.691]  Do you remember the story of the cake mix?
[00:52:21.591 --> 00:52:22.412]  Not offhand.
[00:52:23.072 --> 00:52:26.914]  They were trying to sell women powdered cake mix.
[00:52:27.594 --> 00:52:29.795]  And women didn't want to buy it, because they were like, no, I'm a woman.
[00:52:29.855 --> 00:52:30.476]  I know how to bake.
[00:52:30.516 --> 00:52:31.796]  I'm not going to buy a powdered cake mix.
[00:52:31.836 --> 00:52:33.097]  They found it insulting, right?
[00:52:33.677 --> 00:52:40.421]  So what they did is, they did all these focus groups to figure out why women weren't buying the processed powdered cake mix.
[00:52:40.881 --> 00:52:48.605]  And they found out that because women felt like it was taking their womanhood away, they figured out, well, we'll tell women to crack an egg in the powdered cake mix.
[00:52:49.185 --> 00:52:57.032]  They feel like they're doing something and all of a sudden the cake mix sales went through the roof and to this day people are buying powder cake mix simply because they think they have to add an egg.
[00:52:57.052 --> 00:52:57.933]  You don't need an egg in there.
[00:52:58.253 --> 00:53:01.295]  They just told you to add an egg because it would make you feel like you were doing something.
[00:53:01.556 --> 00:53:09.922]  The point being that that was when we figured out or that's when marketers figured out that there was a way to get people to buy things, to hit their buy buttons.
[00:53:09.962 --> 00:53:12.104]  In fact, there's a book out now called Biology.
[00:53:12.244 --> 00:53:12.905]  Have you seen that?
[00:53:13.245 --> 00:53:13.866]  B-U-I.
[00:53:14.306 --> 00:53:17.809]  Biology, bi-ology, which is the science of how we buy.
[00:53:17.849 --> 00:53:23.995]  They have it down, and by the way, the Obama campaign was like almost the pinnacle in all of this, understanding how to manipulate people.
[00:53:25.276 --> 00:53:26.677]  Politicians use this all the time.
[00:53:27.097 --> 00:53:35.625]  But today, they can actually track your movements in a grocery store to see how much time you're spending at each shelf in the grocery store.
[00:53:35.945 --> 00:53:41.070]  And they have these new interactive devices that are being put on shopping carts, and supposedly they're going to tell you
[00:53:41.590 --> 00:53:45.571]  They'll be personalized based on your buying habits, based on your little frequency buyer card.
[00:53:45.811 --> 00:53:51.413]  They'll know exactly what Aaron likes to buy, and as you're wheeling the shopping cart through there, they'll go, sail on Twinkies!
[00:53:51.913 --> 00:53:53.874]  Sail on whatever, whatever you like to buy.
[00:53:53.894 --> 00:53:57.114]  We'll become such slaves, we allow these malls to track us on the smartphones.
[00:53:57.135 --> 00:53:58.855]  You'll be tracked, exactly!
[00:53:58.935 --> 00:54:09.138]  And not only that, but they have iris scanners, and they'll track your eye movements to see how much, how long you're spending focusing on this box or that box, and they'll know how to position things based on the information that they gather.
[00:54:09.258 --> 00:54:15.842]  Look we're going to do a whole part two covering a lot more how to address certain diseases and what's at the heart of it all.
[00:54:16.522 --> 00:54:28.550]  But I also wanted to get into a little bit of my personal story because I have been listening to your show for about six months now and it finally sunk in just from your first two points that you've got to take the protein and you've got to take the essential fats.
[00:54:29.310 --> 00:54:42.260]  And I've lost a ton of weight just doing that alone, some moderate exercises, and taking these longevity supplements that we have at Infowarsteam.com, and then of course your radio show at BrightSideBen.com.
[00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:43.941]  There I am six months ago.
[00:54:43.961 --> 00:54:45.062]  That's amazing.
[00:54:45.342 --> 00:54:47.964]  Yeah, I've lost somewhere on the order of 65 pounds or so.
[00:54:49.065 --> 00:54:50.126]  Aaron, here's the thing.
[00:54:50.707 --> 00:55:00.619]  It's great you lost weight, and I love that we look good and you lose weight, and it's great that you can see that you lost weight because it's a way to visually demonstrate for you how effective a nutritional supplement program like the Longevity products can be.
[00:55:00.980 --> 00:55:04.844]  But what's really important, Aaron, is you just added a decade to your life.
[00:55:05.385 --> 00:55:07.326]  You just reduce your risk of arthritis.
[00:55:07.346 --> 00:55:08.907]  You just reduce your risk of heart disease.
[00:55:08.927 --> 00:55:10.188]  You reduce your risk of cancer.
[00:55:10.388 --> 00:55:11.729]  You reduce your risk of stroke.
[00:55:11.749 --> 00:55:14.791]  You reduce your risk of dying from all the things that Americans die from.
[00:55:14.851 --> 00:55:16.712]  And I don't care about dying personally.
[00:55:16.752 --> 00:55:17.612]  I don't have a fear of death.
[00:55:18.092 --> 00:55:20.274]  What I don't want to happen is I don't want to get a stroke.
[00:55:20.894 --> 00:55:22.115]  And I don't want to have an aneurysm.
[00:55:22.416 --> 00:55:23.877]  And I don't want to end up in a wheelchair.
[00:55:24.118 --> 00:55:26.140]  And I don't want to end up where I can't move my body.
[00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:31.385]  And that is the prognosis, unfortunately, of most Americans if they continue down the road that they're on.
[00:55:31.806 --> 00:55:35.389]  What you just did, in addition to losing 60 pounds and looking good... Yeah.
[00:55:36.050 --> 00:55:41.134]  You added years to your life and reduced your risk of degenerative disease and breakdown and to me that is key.
[00:55:41.535 --> 00:55:43.256]  I don't like being a slave to the system either.
[00:55:43.536 --> 00:55:44.637]  And then that's another thing.
[00:55:45.938 --> 00:55:55.807]  How demeaning it is to be a slave to french fries or to be a slave to some kind of processed food that somebody is trying to sell you that could care less about you.
[00:55:55.827 --> 00:55:58.369]  Do you ever see the person who's making your tacos at Taco Bell?
[00:55:58.849 --> 00:56:00.671]  That person could care less about you.
[00:56:00.771 --> 00:56:01.572]  Thank you for watching.
[00:56:21.783 --> 00:56:22.483]  But it's really true.
[00:56:22.503 --> 00:56:26.846]  When I started taking these supplements, the Longevity and some other good herbs too, you could find.
[00:56:27.366 --> 00:56:29.747]  I mean, I did not have that craving.
[00:56:29.767 --> 00:56:32.289]  That was the only thing that's ever killed those terrible cravings.
[00:56:32.349 --> 00:56:32.989]  That's awesome.
[00:56:33.129 --> 00:56:33.870]  You know, I never get tired.
[00:56:33.890 --> 00:56:34.450]  Thank you for that.
[00:56:34.470 --> 00:56:35.030]  I appreciate that.
[00:56:35.050 --> 00:56:40.794]  I never get tired of hearing stories like that, but I got to tell you, I hear them over and over and over again.
[00:56:40.814 --> 00:56:44.836]  And what seems like a miracle to some folks, to me, it's just the way the body works.
[00:56:45.492 --> 00:56:45.692]  Yeah.
[00:56:46.493 --> 00:56:47.934]  Well, we're going to get into a whole lot more.
[00:56:47.954 --> 00:56:49.294]  You'll see it later this week.
[00:56:49.355 --> 00:56:52.116]  But for now, that's it for the InfoWars Nightly News.
