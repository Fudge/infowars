[00:00:04.895 --> 00:00:09.720]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.322]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.322 --> 00:00:12.863]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.863 --> 00:00:17.048]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.048 --> 00:00:21.112]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:34.445]  Well, this is going to be a worldwide broadcast that you are not going to want to miss.
[00:00:34.445 --> 00:00:36.768]  It is the 8th day of June.
[00:00:38.686 --> 00:00:39.046]  We're good.
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.520]  I think?
[00:01:15.427 --> 00:01:15.747]  I don't
[00:01:34.505 --> 00:01:35.005]  I don't
[00:01:58.803 --> 00:02:06.466]  As well as twitter.com realalexjones, different quick videos shot from their iPhone 4s on the ground.
[00:02:06.466 --> 00:02:15.109]  They're also shooting high quality photos and video that are being uploaded and updated as we speak at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:17.972]  This is breaking in the English media.
[00:02:17.972 --> 00:02:30.687]  It is nowhere in the English-speaking world's media, but it is in the front page of several other newspapers and Watson and Dykes shot video of this and uploaded it just a few hours ago and that's in the...
[00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:32.240]  I don't
[00:02:50.788 --> 00:03:14.137]  In fact, let me just pull this up, is that Infowars.com and the Swiss News is reporting, major Swiss News, is reporting that they are set to decide the new IMF head because Dominique Strauss-Kahn has stepped down because of the latest scandal.
[00:03:15.558 --> 00:03:17.379]  And that is a PrisonPlanet.com article.
[00:03:46.198 --> 00:03:49.179]  Launching, because turnabout's fair play.
[00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:52.400]  Yeah, the term comes from Glenn Beck, Glenn Beck Extreme Insider.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:58.822]  We've got the InfoWars Insider, because it is direct email to you with exclusive videos, articles, and photos.
[00:03:58.822 --> 00:04:00.283]  That's gonna be launched Friday.
[00:04:00.283 --> 00:04:04.104]  You can sign up for free, topinfowars.com, the InfoWars Insider.
[00:04:04.104 --> 00:04:13.928]  Speaking of that, I saw Glenn Beck's new Glenn Beck TV thing, and it's, oh, get the fourth hour of overdrive!
[00:04:13.928 --> 00:04:14.068]  It's...
[00:04:15.643 --> 00:04:17.685]  Basically the PrisonPlanet.TV model.
[00:04:17.685 --> 00:04:19.427]  It's the truth lives here.
[00:04:19.427 --> 00:04:20.128]  And great!
[00:04:20.128 --> 00:04:22.952]  And Beck says it's a next generation network.
[00:04:22.952 --> 00:04:23.833]  Directly to the people.
[00:04:23.833 --> 00:04:25.414]  That's what I've been building the last two years.
[00:04:25.414 --> 00:04:28.098]  And we're going to launch before he launches September 12th.
[00:04:28.098 --> 00:04:29.339]  We're going to be launching.
[00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:31.281]  We already see some in the new studio.
[00:04:31.281 --> 00:04:31.882]  Studios.
[00:04:31.882 --> 00:04:33.224]  We got three new studios over there.
[00:04:33.904 --> 00:04:38.187]  Uh, one with a Charlie Rose look, one with a chroma key, another with a set that's been built.
[00:04:38.187 --> 00:04:39.268]  So there it is.
[00:04:39.268 --> 00:04:39.968]  Very exciting.
[00:04:39.968 --> 00:04:42.670]  And that's what's scaring the establishment media and the government.
[00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.953]  That's why they're moving to try to block alternative media right now.
[00:04:45.953 --> 00:04:48.294]  Admittedly, they are in total panic mode and the U.N.'
[00:04:48.274 --> 00:04:50.136]  's trying to pass all these treaties.
[00:04:50.136 --> 00:04:52.937]  Gerald Salente is joining us as well today.
[00:04:52.937 --> 00:04:57.381]  I got an update on the Catherine Albrecht, uh, breast cancer situation.
[00:04:57.381 --> 00:04:58.281]  It's all coming up.
[00:04:58.281 --> 00:04:58.721]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.606 --> 00:05:07.251]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:05:07.251 --> 00:05:12.395]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:21.122]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:05:21.122 --> 00:05:25.185]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:05:25.185 --> 00:05:27.147]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:05:29.625 --> 00:05:34.208]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[00:05:34.208 --> 00:05:38.051]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[00:05:38.051 --> 00:05:39.272]  Others don't.
[00:05:39.272 --> 00:05:41.413]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:05:41.413 --> 00:05:43.215]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:05:43.215 --> 00:05:46.097]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:05:46.097 --> 00:05:52.721]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:05:52.721 --> 00:05:55.423]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:05:55.423 --> 00:05:57.785]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[00:05:57.785 --> 00:05:58.666]  Others don't.
[00:05:59.773 --> 00:06:04.316]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:06:04.316 --> 00:06:05.236]  Number 1.
[00:06:05.236 --> 00:06:08.659]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:09.519]  Number 2.
[00:06:09.519 --> 00:06:14.422]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:06:14.422 --> 00:06:15.163]  It's true.
[00:06:15.163 --> 00:06:20.026]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:06:20.026 --> 00:06:20.846]  Number 3.
[00:06:20.846 --> 00:06:24.449]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:28.151]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:06:28.351 --> 00:06:29.132]  Number 4.
[00:06:29.132 --> 00:06:31.895]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:06:31.895 --> 00:06:35.579]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:06:35.579 --> 00:06:36.379]  Number 5.
[00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:40.524]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:06:40.524 --> 00:06:45.289]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:49.733]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:49.733 --> 00:06:51.535]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:51.535 --> 00:06:53.797]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:06:53.797 --> 00:06:56.140]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:07:00.663 --> 00:07:02.365]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:07:02.365 --> 00:07:07.691]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:07:07.691 --> 00:07:09.213]  Saving means to make money.
[00:07:09.213 --> 00:07:18.023]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:07:18.744 --> 00:07:26.269]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:07:26.269 --> 00:07:34.274]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:07:34.274 --> 00:07:39.497]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[00:07:39.497 --> 00:07:41.678]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:50.021]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:07:50.021 --> 00:07:52.462]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:14.096 --> 00:08:25.200]  We have an unbelievably power-packed, info, weapon, energized transmission for you today in the next three hours.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:30.162]  I am glad that you've joined us via AM and FM dial, Global Shortwave, XM Sirius.
[00:08:31.122 --> 00:08:44.176]  Infowars.com with the audio streams, JustinTV live video streaming from Switzerland Bilderberg 2011 with our reporters Aaron Dykes and Paul Watson in the field.
[00:08:44.176 --> 00:08:49.322]  We are streaming live video for PrisonPlanet.tv members and viewers as well.
[00:08:49.322 --> 00:08:51.745]  Right now there is Jim Tucker and other press.
[00:08:52.425 --> 00:08:58.911]  Jim Tucker, of course, 35 years covering Bilderberg, even back when the media said he was insane and it didn't exist.
[00:08:58.911 --> 00:09:02.074]  Royalty, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers meeting in secret.
[00:09:02.074 --> 00:09:18.007]  We've gotten their documents over the years where they openly push to abolish national sovereignty, private property for the general public, and bring in a global neo-colonial feudal serf carbon tax to shut down all human activity not authorized by them.
[00:09:19.208 --> 00:09:22.111]  And so, Jim Tucker is being interviewed on the ground.
[00:09:22.111 --> 00:09:24.813]  Let's fade up the audio right now, live from Switzerland.
[00:09:24.813 --> 00:09:27.235]  Here it is.
[00:09:27.235 --> 00:09:29.637]  Right when I went to him, Tucker stopped talking.
[00:09:29.637 --> 00:09:40.345]  We've got a $150,000 Mercedes pulling up and looking at him, a servant of the Bilderbergs, no doubt, turning into the hotel.
[00:09:40.345 --> 00:09:45.189]  Looks like Bilderberg folks are already arriving.
[00:09:45.189 --> 00:09:48.172]  This is live video, guys, so make sure on the radio we're running the delay.
[00:09:49.654 --> 00:09:52.617]  Oh yeah, they got police there outside the hotel.
[00:09:52.617 --> 00:09:56.881]  This is definitely Bilderberg.
[00:09:56.881 --> 00:10:01.885]  Again, right now Matt Ryan is embedding the JustinTV free version of this.
[00:10:01.885 --> 00:10:07.711]  It's also simulcast at PrisonPlanet.tv to Infowars.com.
[00:10:07.711 --> 00:10:09.673]  Easy, went straight through.
[00:10:09.673 --> 00:10:13.036]  No ten hour interrogation for Aaron this time.
[00:10:13.036 --> 00:10:13.796]  There's Paul Watson.
[00:10:15.126 --> 00:10:22.090]  Okay, and the video feed cut, so they went to the hotel where they believed it was being held.
[00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:22.750]  They got there.
[00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:23.751]  There's checkpoints.
[00:10:23.751 --> 00:10:24.751]  There's police.
[00:10:24.751 --> 00:10:25.712]  You're not going up there.
[00:10:25.712 --> 00:10:27.492]  There's already a bunch of press.
[00:10:27.492 --> 00:10:28.873]  So there you have it live.
[00:10:28.873 --> 00:10:33.756]  I told you it's going to be absolutely jam-packed.
[00:10:33.756 --> 00:10:35.537]  If you're a radio listener and just tuned in,
[00:10:36.777 --> 00:10:38.338]  This is the new media.
[00:10:38.338 --> 00:11:04.510]  This is the integration of the long form, lots of guests, lots of news, lots of information that talk radio can provide, integrated with all the new technologies that are becoming more and more reliable, video Skype and other systems, to be able to send our reporters all over the world and bring it to you uncensored by the globalists.
[00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:04.890]  Remember,
[00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:09.633]  Three years ago, Obama and Hillary met secretly at Bilderberg in Virginia.
[00:11:09.633 --> 00:11:10.234]  We were there.
[00:11:10.234 --> 00:11:13.716]  The whole world didn't know for a day where Hillary and Obama were.
[00:11:13.716 --> 00:11:17.119]  They were in there making the deal for him to be president, her to step down.
[00:11:17.119 --> 00:11:20.121]  We predicted it before it happened from our sources inside.
[00:11:20.121 --> 00:11:25.525]  We called all the major national media and they said, we want to come down there, but we're not allowed to.
[00:11:25.525 --> 00:11:27.667]  No newspapers, nothing.
[00:11:27.667 --> 00:11:29.188]  No mainstream media.
[00:11:29.188 --> 00:11:31.070]  While it was the top story in the country,
[00:11:32.464 --> 00:11:35.204]  In early June, for a day, where is Obama and Hillary?
[00:11:36.601 --> 00:11:45.045]  Remember, Obama loaded all the people in Dulles, a few miles away from where they were meeting, onto the plane, said he was getting on, and the plane took off, closed the doors, they said, where's Obama?
[00:11:45.045 --> 00:11:49.628]  They actually shanghaied, kidnapped the reporters, remember that big national story?
[00:11:49.628 --> 00:11:52.629]  So they wouldn't follow Obama, so he could go to that meeting.
[00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:55.631]  Even when we then called them and said, here he is!
[00:11:55.631 --> 00:11:57.772]  The motorcade just went in, him and Hillary!
[00:11:57.772 --> 00:11:59.933]  Secret Service with machine guns!
[00:11:59.933 --> 00:12:01.874]  Marines in plain clothes!
[00:12:01.874 --> 00:12:03.815]  They said, sorry, we don't cover that!
[00:12:04.457 --> 00:12:12.425]  Now, we are breaking that media blockade, and that's why talk radio has always broken the establishment control blockade.
[00:12:12.425 --> 00:12:14.346]  That's why they tried to have the Fairness Doctrine for it.
[00:12:14.346 --> 00:12:15.648]  That's why they want to bring it back.
[00:12:15.648 --> 00:12:21.053]  It's why they want FCC Fairness Doctrine on the Internet, as the White House regulations are, Cass Sunstein has written.
[00:12:22.008 --> 00:12:27.010]  They do not want you getting what you are about to get here today.
[00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:35.133]  Now, as soon as you get Watson and them, it's great to show the crowds of reporters something they dread and hate, but let's go up and talk to the police.
[00:12:35.133 --> 00:12:37.833]  Let's show that video of them being turned away.
[00:12:37.833 --> 00:12:44.116]  All of this being archived right now as well at PrisonPlanet.tv and at the JustinTV channel.
[00:12:44.116 --> 00:12:46.316]  It's now up live at InfoWars.com.
[00:12:46.316 --> 00:12:50.798]  Exclusive live video and photos from Bilderberg, continually updated
[00:12:51.278 --> 00:13:00.164]  This year's Bilderberg meeting is Underwear in Switzerland and we have reporters on the ground bringing us powerful images and video from the scene.
[00:13:00.164 --> 00:13:03.586]  And on screen right now, we have a photo taken by one of our crew.
[00:13:03.586 --> 00:13:04.266]  That was a video.
[00:13:04.266 --> 00:13:05.887]  The video had frozen.
[00:13:05.887 --> 00:13:10.450]  Continuing, the article will continually be updated with the latest images and video from St.
[00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:12.891]  Moritz, Switzerland.
[00:13:12.891 --> 00:13:15.853]  And you can go see some of those incredible high-def photos.
[00:13:15.853 --> 00:13:17.514]  We do have Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:13:17.514 --> 00:13:18.315]  Let's put him up.
[00:13:20.709 --> 00:13:26.511]  Paul, joining us via cell phone, tell us the name of the hotel, exactly where you are in St.
[00:13:26.511 --> 00:13:43.495]  Moritz, what you're witnessing there, and then as soon as you get off, I want you to just do some panning video shots of the castle, the hotel, of the police, and I want you to go up with Tucker, as we always do, or yourself, and be turned away.
[00:13:43.495 --> 00:13:48.617]  I want you to go up and have them tell you that you're turned away, just to show folks exactly what's going on.
[00:13:48.617 --> 00:13:49.157]  Paul Watson.
[00:13:50.919 --> 00:13:58.102]  Hello Alex, yeah, we're just down the hill from the Hotel Sovretta, which is the hotel that Bilderberg are meeting at.
[00:13:58.102 --> 00:14:06.625]  There was speculation that it would be the Kempinski, but we drove there earlier and there was no activity, so we've located the hotel.
[00:14:06.625 --> 00:14:12.348]  There's an excellent shot of the hotel from just up the road and that's where we're going to head in a moment.
[00:14:13.308 --> 00:14:18.713]  We're gathered with the journalists from We Are Change, Luke Rudowsky, etc.
[00:14:18.713 --> 00:14:20.654]  Of course, Jim Tucker.
[00:14:20.654 --> 00:14:30.802]  And we've been broadcasting on Just In TV numerous videos, so people can check out that Alex Jones channel for the live coverage and the archive videos.
[00:14:30.802 --> 00:14:36.026]  But we're just at the bottom of the hill, just in front of the security barrier.
[00:14:36.026 --> 00:14:37.908]  There's private security, there's police.
[00:14:38.568 --> 00:14:52.217]  And as Luke Rudowsky was saying in the Just In TV video that we were just broadcasting live, people have been asked for their ID and passports and Luke's passport was actually taken from him and held for 30 minutes.
[00:14:52.217 --> 00:14:57.460]  So the police are just saying that if you don't give us your ID, we're going to arrest you.
[00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:58.981]  And that's what's happening at the moment.
[00:14:58.981 --> 00:15:02.824]  So we're about to head up the hill and get shots of the actual hotel itself.
[00:15:03.044 --> 00:15:11.766]  Okay, are you saying you don't recommend them going up to the police line because you don't want them to grab your passport?
[00:15:11.766 --> 00:15:31.389]  Um, you can actually walk up the hill and get a shot of the hotel without breaking any kind of police barrier, so... But to be clear, Paul, to be clear, Luke Rodowski, founder of We Are Change, who's there, reporting for RT, he went up there just to the police line to talk to them, and they grabbed his, they demanded his passport?
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:39.285]  Yeah, they held it for at least half an hour until he got it back.
[00:15:39.285 --> 00:15:56.078]  Well, that's a major news blurb that we need to get you to Twitter out, then we'll have Kurt Nemo or Matt Ryan both doing great jobs putting together your reporting, that reporter Luke Radowski, RT reporter, had passport taken by Swiss police.
[00:15:56.078 --> 00:15:59.600]  Reporter has passport taken by
[00:16:00.581 --> 00:16:01.581]  I think it's important
[00:16:22.688 --> 00:16:31.136]  That at least one of you does go up there, even though they do take the passport, let it be a diplomatic row, that you just as a reporter walk up and say, what's going on here with the police?
[00:16:31.136 --> 00:16:43.267]  Alex, what they're claiming is that in Switzerland, and I believe this is true because I've read it before, if you're not a Swiss citizen, if you're an immigrant or a tourist, they can demand your ID.
[00:16:43.267 --> 00:16:45.309]  Whether they can hold it is another question.
[00:16:45.309 --> 00:16:46.510]  No, I understand.
[00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:47.831]  I understand that.
[00:16:47.831 --> 00:16:48.531]  The issue is,
[00:16:49.574 --> 00:17:08.471]  The New York Times, as you know, three years ago, doing a review of the New World Order film on IFC, said that I was delusional having hallucinations at the Chantilly Marriott while Bilderberg was meeting, and that Obama wasn't there, Hillary wasn't there, nobody was there.
[00:17:08.471 --> 00:17:10.313]  They said we were insane.
[00:17:10.313 --> 00:17:13.155]  And that's still said by our media, so we need
[00:17:13.996 --> 00:17:15.838]  They'll just say, oh, that's a shot of a hotel.
[00:17:15.838 --> 00:17:19.002]  We need... They want to keep their hoax going.
[00:17:19.002 --> 00:17:21.385]  Remember, just a few years ago, this still didn't exist.
[00:17:21.385 --> 00:17:28.073]  More and more, they're having to admit it while at the same time saying it doesn't exist because they have pure disdain for their readers.
[00:17:28.073 --> 00:17:29.255]  So I'll talk to you during the break.
[00:17:29.255 --> 00:17:29.695]  Now, Paul...
[00:17:30.595 --> 00:17:41.698]  Continuing before you get that live shot and photo shots for everybody at InfoWars.com and watching at PrisonPlanet.tv and all the radio listeners, go to InfoWars.com and follow this video and everything that's happening.
[00:17:41.698 --> 00:17:44.299]  Again, 21st century cutting edge media.
[00:17:44.299 --> 00:17:47.560]  Years ago, these technologies didn't work well enough for us to use them a lot.
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:48.880]  Now they're really working well.
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.261]  Very, very exciting.
[00:17:51.161 --> 00:17:51.941]  Well, the thing is that
[00:18:10.282 --> 00:18:39.800]  Swiss newspapers yesterday reported that Bilderberg had no power and yet today we picked up newspapers and the main headline was the fact that Bilderberg is choosing the new IMF head to replace Strauss-Kahn and we showed the front page of the newspaper on our video broadcast earlier which is on Infowars and Prison Planet and it's just another indication that they do have real power and they exercise it on a regular basis much to the chagrin of debunkers who often claim otherwise.
[00:18:41.013 --> 00:18:54.378]  So basically, the majority of the Swiss newspapers are now reporting on it, and it's on the front page of two major Swiss newspapers that Bilderberg are deciding the new IMF head to replace, Strauss Kahn.
[00:18:54.378 --> 00:18:59.140]  Now, Paul, you guys have two video cameras, two cell phone cameras.
[00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:04.242]  I guess, is Aaron jacked into Justin.TV because we're not getting feeds right now?
[00:19:06.227 --> 00:19:08.368]  Aaron's on his way up here.
[00:19:08.368 --> 00:19:11.550]  They won't let you park near the security area.
[00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:13.231]  They've made you park further away.
[00:19:13.231 --> 00:19:18.194]  Aaron's here now, and he's going to be filming more video for JustinTV.
[00:19:18.194 --> 00:19:29.701]  Alright, the number one thing we need before you go up the hill is for you to get up-close photos of the police and security, or the New York Times will say again that we are literally schizophrenics.
[00:19:29.701 --> 00:19:31.022]  This is how dumb the readers are.
[00:19:31.982 --> 00:19:37.604]  That Alex Jones at an empty hotel imagining men hiding behind trees and that there's no one there.
[00:19:37.604 --> 00:19:39.505]  They will say there's no one there.
[00:19:39.505 --> 00:19:41.585]  They don't care if it's all over the Swiss papers.
[00:19:41.585 --> 00:19:44.747]  We've got to have photos of the cops with the submachine guns.
[00:19:44.747 --> 00:19:45.727]  Or they'll say they don't exist.
[00:19:45.727 --> 00:19:46.647]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:46.647 --> 00:19:47.027]  Stay with us.
[00:19:47.027 --> 00:19:47.588]  Stay there, Watson.
[00:19:47.588 --> 00:19:48.668]  I'm going to talk to you off-air.
[00:20:01.189 --> 00:20:05.430]  The number one secret to having great health and long life is having high levels of glutathione.
[00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:17.094]  This master antioxidant is required by your body to stop free radicals, keep cells young, remove chemical and heavy metal toxins, support immunity, support liver functions, stop inflammation, and much more.
[00:20:17.094 --> 00:20:24.556]  The results of optimal levels of glutathione in your body are more mental and physical energy, stronger immune system, greater endurance, and more.
[00:20:24.556 --> 00:20:29.358]  Do you know the number one secret superfood that helps increase your glutathione levels by 64% or more?
[00:20:30.538 --> 00:20:33.860]  It's unheated whey protein powder from grass-fed cows.
[00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:38.283]  This health food is amazing in its ability to do so much for virtually everyone.
[00:20:38.283 --> 00:20:44.248]  Introducing One World Whey, an industry-first unheated whey protein powder from grass-fed cows.

[00:21:59.895 --> 00:22:01.197]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:22:01.197 --> 00:22:06.784]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:22:06.784 --> 00:22:11.811]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:22:11.811 --> 00:22:16.857]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:22:17.378 --> 00:22:22.604]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:22:22.604 --> 00:22:29.732]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:22:29.732 --> 00:22:30.854]  And here's the best part.
[00:22:30.854 --> 00:22:37.201]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:22:37.521 --> 00:22:40.702]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:22:40.702 --> 00:22:42.923]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[00:22:44.063 --> 00:22:47.505]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:22:47.505 --> 00:22:49.245]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:22:59.588 --> 00:23:06.553]  Iodine Protection Packs from HempUSA.org are now in stock for immediate delivery worldwide.

[00:23:29.048 --> 00:23:38.374]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:23:38.374 --> 00:23:39.155]  This capitalism?
[00:23:39.155 --> 00:23:45.439]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:23:45.439 --> 00:23:46.300]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:49.562]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[00:23:49.562 --> 00:23:50.382]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[00:23:50.382 --> 00:23:51.443]  It's time to understand the system.
[00:23:51.443 --> 00:23:52.083]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:23:52.083 --> 00:23:52.364]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:24:09.536 --> 00:24:13.199]  Okay, to be clear, our video feeds are only intermittent.
[00:24:13.199 --> 00:24:23.507]  We have a live Twitter feed of photos pouring in that InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com reporters Aaron Dykes and Paul Joseph Watson are getting live from Bilderberg 2011.
[00:24:25.569 --> 00:24:26.070]  We're getting more
[00:24:45.131 --> 00:24:49.553]  It is alternative media, but it's bigger than most mainstream media, is the Drudge Report.
[00:24:49.553 --> 00:24:54.356]  We are behind the scenes in contact with their editors, and so look for that coverage.
[00:24:54.356 --> 00:25:09.163]  They're breaking news, so the best place to hear the continual coverage of live radio, live video mixes and photos will be at InfoWars.com on the section that Matt Ryan is going to be continually updating.
[00:25:09.163 --> 00:25:12.745]  Exclusive live video and photos from Bilderberg, continually updated.
[00:25:12.745 --> 00:25:13.786]  Why is this so important?
[00:25:14.246 --> 00:25:18.009]  There wasn't any information that I could see, obviously we don't read German, as to who it was.
[00:25:41.229 --> 00:25:46.859]  The headline was, Bilderberg to choose successor for Strauss Kahn.
[00:25:48.112 --> 00:25:52.274]  And that's what we worked out from the translation, which was in the newspaper.
[00:25:52.274 --> 00:25:55.115]  Yeah, well, we've got sources as well, and Kurt's translating it.
[00:25:55.115 --> 00:25:57.176]  Yes, it looks like they may pick.
[00:25:57.176 --> 00:25:59.337]  We're going to have that name and more information.
[00:25:59.337 --> 00:26:00.337]  Kurt gave it to me during the break.
[00:26:00.337 --> 00:26:02.218]  But all of this is unfolding.
[00:26:02.218 --> 00:26:05.319]  And what's important is they decide when the Berlin Wall goes down.
[00:26:05.319 --> 00:26:07.020]  They decide when to launch a new war.
[00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:08.940]  We've gotten their internal documents before.
[00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:13.442]  This is as close to the secret, smoky, New World Order mafia room as it gets.
[00:26:13.442 --> 00:26:17.224]  Watson, we're going to have you live with a full report coming up in an hour and a half,
[00:26:18.104 --> 00:26:23.406]  About an hour and 20 minutes from now, a little bit into the third hour today via video Skype.
[00:26:23.406 --> 00:26:26.987]  Joining us with Aaron Dykes as you collate more of this information.
[00:26:26.987 --> 00:26:35.689]  We'll continue to check in with you in the next 30 minutes as things develop via cell phone and we'll continue to watch the live feeds at InfoWars.com that we have embedded.
[00:26:35.689 --> 00:26:42.311]  But any other tidbits of intel you can relay to the worldwide listeners as you cover the Global Crime Syndicate meeting.
[00:26:44.079 --> 00:27:00.633]  Yeah, we were talking to Jim Tucker and we broadcast one of these videos on Justin TV, which should be archived, and he was relating the fact that his sons are telling him that Bilderberg is petrified about the resistance within Congress to their conquest of
[00:27:01.173 --> 00:27:13.863]  Olivia, and of course we've had Rand Paul in recent weeks demanding that Obama legally justify the attack because of course it's gone over 60 days, which is in the War Powers Act, but that's unconstitutional.
[00:27:13.863 --> 00:27:23.571]  So Jim Tucker says that Bilderberg are petrified of the fact that the resistance to that is building within Congress and that it may derail their plans.
[00:27:24.091 --> 00:27:25.152]  And by the way, Jim...
[00:27:39.281 --> 00:27:40.502]  I'm getting shells right now.
[00:27:57.353 --> 00:28:05.916]  Ladies and gentlemen, these are the people steering our planet, and they are scared, they are upset by the demonstrators, they're upset by the coverage.
[00:28:05.916 --> 00:28:09.557]  We've got the intel streaming in from our sources right now.
[00:28:09.557 --> 00:28:13.619]  Paul Watson, anything else that Jim told you from his sources?
[00:28:15.379 --> 00:28:18.400]  Um, we've got a bit of Justin TV.
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:21.682]  There were numerous things, but those were the main ones.
[00:28:21.682 --> 00:28:26.084]  I've got Aaron Dykes here if you want to get some words from Aaron.
[00:28:26.084 --> 00:28:26.844]  Yeah, let's do that.
[00:28:26.844 --> 00:28:29.565]  We're going to come back from break and go to Aaron in the long segment.
[00:28:29.565 --> 00:28:31.526]  Matt Ryan, we're going to put you on hold, Paul.
[00:28:31.526 --> 00:28:32.327]  Thank you.
[00:28:32.327 --> 00:28:34.248]  Paul Watson reporting from Switzerland in St.
[00:28:34.248 --> 00:28:36.669]  Moritz under police guard there.
[00:28:37.449 --> 00:28:37.889]  Thank you, Matt.
[00:29:00.652 --> 00:29:07.196]  Yes, basically it's going to be a collaboration of all of our coverage of Bilderberg from start to finish live.
[00:29:07.196 --> 00:29:09.737]  Our live stream is embedded in there.
[00:29:09.737 --> 00:29:12.819]  We also have the Twitter feed at RealAlexJones on Twitter.
[00:29:12.819 --> 00:29:24.946]  That is embedded into that page, so you can go to one page and get all the information, see the updates as they come out, and that'll be in addition to all of the coverage that's done by Curt Nimmo, Paul Watson, Steve Watson, and the others.
[00:29:24.946 --> 00:29:27.667]  I'm really proud of this team, Matt Ryan.
[00:29:27.667 --> 00:29:28.528]  I'm proud to be part of it.
[00:29:29.068 --> 00:29:39.476]  Well, you're kicking serious hind end, and Matt Ryan is also a writer for a major technology publication, but we'll be working more with him in the future in his deep investigations of Google.
[00:29:39.476 --> 00:29:41.658]  That is some groundbreaking bombshell info.
[00:29:41.658 --> 00:29:45.681]  That's coming up in the next few weeks with Matt Ryan and others here on air with us.
[00:29:45.681 --> 00:29:49.083]  We'll be right back with more of Matt Ryan and our reporters in Switzerland.
[00:29:49.083 --> 00:29:50.705]  Stay with us.
[00:29:50.705 --> 00:29:52.106]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.106 --> 00:29:54.628]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.628 --> 00:29:57.310]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.559 --> 00:30:05.560]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:08.821]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:30:08.821 --> 00:30:13.602]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:30:13.602 --> 00:30:20.004]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:30:20.004 --> 00:30:22.245]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:30:22.765 --> 00:30:23.085]  Tim Geithner?
[00:30:23.085 --> 00:30:23.606]  Bernanke?
[00:30:23.606 --> 00:30:24.266]  They're arsonists!
[00:30:24.266 --> 00:30:25.367]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:30:25.367 --> 00:30:27.788]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:30:41.696 --> 00:30:43.818]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:30:43.818 --> 00:30:48.964]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[00:32:00.912 --> 00:32:02.632]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:32:02.632 --> 00:32:07.934]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:32:07.934 --> 00:32:09.474]  Saving means to make money.
[00:32:09.474 --> 00:32:18.257]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:32:18.997 --> 00:32:26.543]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:32:26.543 --> 00:32:34.549]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:32:34.549 --> 00:32:39.772]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[00:33:17.213 --> 00:33:32.844]  Nothing can keep us at the bottom of the mountain, up on the mountain, Bilderberg Group meeting, openly getting ready for their new IMF head, openly planning a gigantic new war in the Middle East, on record fomented by Western governments, the US, Israel, and England, openly fomenting the Arab Spring.
[00:33:34.946 --> 00:33:38.891]  2012 2011 Bilderberg coverage and so much is happening.
[00:33:38.891 --> 00:33:45.439]  Meanwhile the news is insane and that's all coming up with Gerald Salente later.
[00:33:45.439 --> 00:33:50.045]  We have the new generation of the naked body scanners.
[00:33:50.045 --> 00:33:50.685]  We have
[00:33:52.173 --> 00:33:55.436]  Incredible economic news unfolding.
[00:33:55.436 --> 00:33:59.240]  SWAT team breaks down man's door over student loans.
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:02.624]  We have Americans being arrested everywhere for credit card debt.
[00:34:02.624 --> 00:34:04.926]  Debtor prisons are illegal.
[00:34:04.926 --> 00:34:14.916]  The Department of Education now has federalized local police that will bust down your door and they kidnap the guy for six hours over student loans.
[00:34:15.817 --> 00:34:17.838]  The bankers are coming.
[00:34:17.838 --> 00:34:19.599]  The bankers are coming.
[00:34:19.599 --> 00:34:25.741]  Paul Revere, 240-something years ago, said the redcoats are coming.
[00:34:25.741 --> 00:34:28.442]  No, ladies and gentlemen, the banksters are coming.
[00:34:28.442 --> 00:34:37.106]  Not your local bank, not your credit union that are real banks, the big mega global six banks, the big mega five banks in the U.S., Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan.
[00:34:37.106 --> 00:34:43.729]  These are people like Bank of America that control the issuance of the currency and credit worldwide, and they're leaders.
[00:34:44.369 --> 00:34:58.434]  Their heads are meeting with royalty right now to decide the future of our world and our brave, dogged reporters, our gumshoe, straw hat reporters are on the scene.
[00:34:58.434 --> 00:34:59.214]  They're covering it.
[00:34:59.214 --> 00:35:01.095]  We're showing live video.
[00:35:01.095 --> 00:35:09.918]  They drove up the hill past the police checkpoints that are at the entrance and are attempting to get people's shots.
[00:35:09.918 --> 00:35:13.819]  There is Aaron Dykes in the video that PrisonPlanet.tv viewers can watch.
[00:35:14.159 --> 00:35:22.609]  Also, we have the free video feed at InfoWars.com embedded in the article, exclusive live video and photos from Bilderberg, continually updated right now.
[00:35:22.609 --> 00:35:24.451]  Get this link out to everybody.
[00:35:24.451 --> 00:35:28.436]  Also, follow the video feeds at Twitter.com forward slash RealAlexJones.
[00:35:28.436 --> 00:35:30.599]  That Twitter feed is there at InfoWars.com.
[00:35:31.059 --> 00:35:31.340]  U.S.
[00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:34.083]  funding for future promises lags by trillions.
[00:35:34.083 --> 00:35:35.344]  USA Today.
[00:35:35.344 --> 00:35:35.985]  OPEC.
[00:35:35.985 --> 00:35:36.966]  Talks break down.
[00:35:36.966 --> 00:35:38.508]  No deal to lift oil supply.
[00:35:38.508 --> 00:35:40.831]  That means oil prices will only go up.
[00:35:40.831 --> 00:35:41.932]  China warns U.S.
[00:35:41.932 --> 00:35:44.875]  debt default idea is playing with fire.
[00:35:44.875 --> 00:35:46.017]  Associated Press.
[00:35:46.017 --> 00:35:47.318]  This is red level.
[00:35:47.318 --> 00:35:48.059]  Reuters.
[00:35:48.059 --> 00:35:48.960]  Similar headline.
[00:35:50.902 --> 00:35:51.523]  Gold.
[00:35:51.523 --> 00:35:53.184]  Little change after Bernanke comments.
[00:35:53.184 --> 00:35:54.385]  Bernanke speaks.
[00:35:54.385 --> 00:35:56.227]  Stock market plunges.
[00:35:56.227 --> 00:35:57.929]  I mean, this is insane.
[00:35:57.929 --> 00:36:02.593]  And all over the country, every day I see articles now, arrested for debts.
[00:36:02.593 --> 00:36:05.055]  And then it turns out they're not even allowed to do it by law.
[00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:14.276]  They will announce court dates, never tell the person to be there, and then arrest them for failure to appear, and then intimidate them.
[00:36:14.276 --> 00:36:21.561]  There are police, they're up close to the militarized police there that are at another one of the entrances.
[00:36:21.561 --> 00:36:23.362]  There is the hotel where they're meeting.
[00:36:23.362 --> 00:36:25.584]  We take you now, live, to St.
[00:36:25.584 --> 00:36:33.190]  Moritz, Switzerland, where the crime syndicate that has engineered a global black hole of debt, 1.5 quadrillion, 1,500 trillion,
[00:36:34.991 --> 00:36:35.831]  Possible.
[00:36:35.831 --> 00:36:39.914]  Hundreds of times the wealth in the world cannot be paid back.
[00:36:39.914 --> 00:36:41.135]  Sucking the country dry.
[00:36:41.135 --> 00:36:42.135]  27 trillion.
[00:36:42.135 --> 00:36:43.656]  Most of it went to foreign banks.
[00:36:43.656 --> 00:36:45.877]  As we told you for years, we were right.
[00:36:45.877 --> 00:36:47.598]  Now admitted in the Bloomberg suit.
[00:36:47.598 --> 00:36:48.519]  Getting the documents.
[00:36:48.519 --> 00:36:49.940]  Do you realize?
[00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:51.481]  There are the criminals.
[00:36:51.481 --> 00:36:53.882]  There are the people openly wanting world government.
[00:36:54.202 --> 00:37:02.469]  Openly wanting carbon taxes to shut down all their competition and selectively let GE heads, who do attend these meetings, be able to have the only power plants.
[00:37:02.469 --> 00:37:06.452]  To only let Obama supporters and globalists not have to buy the insurance.
[00:37:06.452 --> 00:37:09.274]  Aaron Dykes, they're reporting from Switzerland.
[00:37:09.774 --> 00:37:26.008]  As World War III has prepared the Middle East openly, Rand Corporation calling for it, as the dollar plunges, as they talk about dollar default, as Moody's and S&P say it may default, as everything begins to accelerate, there you are, and where is the international mainstream media?
[00:37:26.008 --> 00:37:27.469]  Nowhere to be seen.
[00:37:27.469 --> 00:37:31.353]  Swiss News with insiders reporting they're preparing to pick the new IMF head.
[00:37:31.753 --> 00:37:34.596]  Not the governments of Europe and the US, but the corporate leaders.
[00:37:47.108 --> 00:37:47.188]  Yes.
[00:38:03.208 --> 00:38:06.429]  Portugal, to Spain, to Ireland.
[00:38:06.429 --> 00:38:11.931]  The Irish Times says Ireland is being conquered by private banks.
[00:38:11.931 --> 00:38:16.633]  We must stop the bailouts, which are, again, the bankers say they owe this.
[00:38:16.633 --> 00:38:18.294]  Our pension funds are all tied into it.
[00:38:18.294 --> 00:38:23.375]  They hold us hostage and say give us unlimited trillions, pay us carbon taxes or we'll destroy you.
[00:38:23.375 --> 00:38:25.456]  Aaron, you are there in the belly of the beast.
[00:38:25.456 --> 00:38:26.357]  I salute you.
[00:38:26.357 --> 00:38:27.217]  Tell us what's happening.
[00:38:28.323 --> 00:38:41.233]  Alex, I'm here, surrounded 360 degrees by the beautiful Swiss Alps, next to the biggest hotel, the Hotel Suburrata, overlooking the rest of the area here in San Moritz.
[00:38:41.233 --> 00:38:44.535]  They've got private security as well as police.
[00:38:44.535 --> 00:38:48.518]  They say the private security's been here since yesterday, our sources tell us.
[00:38:48.518 --> 00:38:53.742]  They have makeshift surveillance cameras on every rooftop and sub-rooftop.
[00:38:53.742 --> 00:38:54.763]  They have floodlights.
[00:38:55.623 --> 00:38:58.105]  I guess we could see if anyone is sneaking around.
[00:38:58.105 --> 00:39:03.447]  They've got ID checkpoints, a cordon set up all around the perimeter.
[00:39:03.447 --> 00:39:14.193]  They've even tried to block off part of the view at the security checkpoint where they have a trailer set up for the limos to come through so the attendees can't be easily photographed as they come in.
[00:39:15.093 --> 00:39:16.214]  Oh yeah, I saw some of the...
[00:39:38.493 --> 00:39:41.734]  Maybach, Super Mercedes and others going in.
[00:39:41.734 --> 00:39:42.695]  I've seen those before.
[00:39:42.695 --> 00:39:43.495]  They're there.
[00:39:43.495 --> 00:39:48.657]  And if we see diplomatic cars coming in, you know, Hillary's in Europe right now with her special friend.
[00:39:48.657 --> 00:39:50.838]  That's a whole other scandal.
[00:39:50.838 --> 00:39:53.399]  That is the wife of Wiener.
[00:39:53.399 --> 00:39:56.500]  So Wiener gate's only the tip of the Wiener gate.
[00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:58.301]  We've got all that happening.
[00:39:58.301 --> 00:39:59.501]  This is so huge.
[00:39:59.501 --> 00:40:01.682]  And we've got Tucker and others with inside Intel.
[00:40:02.462 --> 00:40:07.266]  Give us some of the things that our inside sources are telling us are on the agenda.
[00:40:07.266 --> 00:40:12.490]  Some years, Tucker Source even sends him the internal agenda report.
[00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:14.091]  Get that, immediately get it out.
[00:40:14.091 --> 00:40:17.094]  Folks can also follow it at AmericanFreePress.net.
[00:40:17.094 --> 00:40:18.155]  Give us your report, Aaron.
[00:40:19.209 --> 00:40:27.619]  Well of course a lot of it, Paul Watson just relayed to you, but of course they do want a wider war according to Tucker's sources.
[00:40:27.619 --> 00:40:38.213]  And it makes perfect sense, they've primed the field with the Arab Spring and the semi-nonviolent, although of course a lot of violence behind the scenes, kind of under the covers.
[00:40:38.733 --> 00:40:39.554]  I don't think so.
[00:40:55.041 --> 00:41:04.370]  By way of parallel, you remember a couple years ago, Paul Wolfowitz had his own sex scandal for hiring his mistress at the World Bank.
[00:41:04.370 --> 00:41:16.441]  He stepped down just before that year's conference at Bilderberg, and they reportedly did choose his successor there in the meeting, which ended up being, of course, Robert Zoellick, head of the World Bank.
[00:41:17.555 --> 00:41:26.560]  Unbelievable and Kurt Scott, The Intel, there are sources that they're looking at a particular finance minister out of Mexico to head up the IMF.
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:32.763]  That would be a big shake-up because when they go through these rounds, it's just like Bilderberg only comes to the U.S.
[00:41:32.763 --> 00:41:34.464]  every four years.
[00:41:34.464 --> 00:41:38.265]  Three of the four years they meet in continental Europe or England.
[00:41:38.265 --> 00:41:44.609]  Now the word is usually only one out of four years or rounds of IMF.
[00:41:47.790 --> 00:42:15.480]  It's a huge development because of course the World Bank traditionally goes to an American, the IMF traditionally to a European, so if they were to bring Mexico under the fold that is quite an expansion and obviously a sign they want to partner with other developing nations and bring more people into the centralized global government system.
[00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:22.742]  Aaron, we're going to continue to check in with you and coming up in the third hour we're going to do a video Skype from the hotel.
[00:42:22.742 --> 00:42:34.706]  I may actually change that and just have you guys from the site continue to report and then perhaps do a overdrive with you guys today.
[00:42:34.706 --> 00:42:36.026]  For those that don't know what overdrive is,
[00:42:36.186 --> 00:42:36.266]  It's
[00:43:02.026 --> 00:43:03.849]  And he's indicted in France also!
[00:43:15.785 --> 00:43:17.666]  And he's also been indicted in France.
[00:43:34.933 --> 00:43:53.322]  We've got another headline that needs to get out, that there is a high-tech surveillance grid of police and makeshift cameras, that they are planning a gigantic war, that they're looking at the new IMF ad, they're pushing, they're worried that there's an awakening in Congress to Obama saying that the Libyan war would last days, not weeks.
[00:43:53.322 --> 00:43:58.064]  Now they're saying it'll last into Christmas, into next year, maybe for years, as long as it takes.
[00:43:58.064 --> 00:44:01.786]  And again, we've got video feeds right now of Aaron joining us on air.
[00:44:01.786 --> 00:44:02.927]  Let's continue with that shot.
[00:44:03.687 --> 00:44:05.628]  Uh, with the Swiss Alps in the background.
[00:44:05.628 --> 00:44:11.189]  I envy you guys, but I've got to stay here in the rear with the gear, uh, and direct all of this.
[00:44:11.189 --> 00:44:16.350]  Uh, Aaron, continuing, um, any other points, uh, that you'd like to add for folks?
[00:44:16.350 --> 00:44:19.971]  Well, you know, it's hard to know off, offhand how clear the video is.
[00:44:19.971 --> 00:44:22.791]  These tripods... It's crystal clear!
[00:44:22.791 --> 00:44:24.632]  Can you hear me?
[00:44:24.632 --> 00:44:25.232]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:42.223]  Just to be clear, in case the video is not, they have these surveillance cams on makeshift tripods, really about every 10 to 20 feet on every ledge, every sub-rooftop of this enormous and very gorgeous hotel, so it's very interesting.
[00:44:42.223 --> 00:44:54.525]  Ask Paul, ask Paul, ask Paul who's shooting live video right now for viewers at InfoWars.com to center the camera, because you can't really zoom with that while you're streaming, center the camera with the
[00:44:55.816 --> 00:45:00.720]  Yes, center on the tripods and people can then focus in and see the cameras.
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:02.361]  Is that what looks like a lamp post right there?
[00:45:02.361 --> 00:45:03.562]  Is that the cameras you're talking about?
[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:07.521]  There's a lamppost in the foreground.
[00:45:07.521 --> 00:45:14.703]  Beyond that, you'll see a short ledge with a building that is, at its highest point, about 10 feet.
[00:45:14.703 --> 00:45:16.743]  At its lowest point, only about 4 feet.
[00:45:16.743 --> 00:45:18.364]  Yeah, tell Paul!
[00:45:18.364 --> 00:45:19.484]  Tell Paul!
[00:45:19.484 --> 00:45:20.084]  Tell Paul!
[00:45:20.084 --> 00:45:22.485]  If you can, center on those cameras, please.
[00:45:22.485 --> 00:45:23.705]  Yeah, and tell Paul to stay there.
[00:45:23.705 --> 00:45:26.606]  I want you to step in front of him for folks watching.
[00:45:26.606 --> 00:45:27.927]  And step in front of Paul.
[00:45:29.127 --> 00:45:31.948]  Yeah, because media is so dangerous and so evil compared to the globalist criminals.
[00:45:58.769 --> 00:45:59.658]  Okay, we see you, Aaron.
[00:45:59.658 --> 00:46:00.729]  Point directly to where it's at.
[00:46:02.759 --> 00:46:10.441]  Okay, you can see here the first surveillance cam, and then behind it on the higher ledge, there's another one next to it, a bank of lights.
[00:46:10.441 --> 00:46:13.542]  Behind that off to the right, a second bank of lights.
[00:46:13.542 --> 00:46:20.604]  Further off to the left, more banks of lights, more surveillance cams, all on these lower ledge roofs.
[00:46:20.604 --> 00:46:27.605]  And that's just, of course, what's visible, because we know they have snipers in place, smaller cameras surveilling for the ceilings.
[00:46:27.605 --> 00:46:29.766]  Obviously, it's an extremely high security zone.
[00:46:30.106 --> 00:46:32.768]  Alright, I'm going to make a call right here.
[00:46:32.768 --> 00:46:38.973]  Let's go ahead and do the third hour with you guys via video Skype, but if you're not ready by then, we'll just push it to the last half hour.
[00:46:38.973 --> 00:46:42.756]  I see you got the high-powered 35mm lens there.
[00:46:42.756 --> 00:46:46.699]  That's what your support folks paid for, so we've been able to bring you this hardcore coverage.
[00:46:47.319 --> 00:46:49.439]  This cutting-edge 21st century coverage.
[00:46:49.439 --> 00:46:52.900]  Get shots of the cops with that super high-def 35 mil.
[00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:54.601]  Get shots of the floodlights.
[00:46:54.601 --> 00:46:55.641]  Get shots of it all.
[00:46:55.641 --> 00:46:56.501]  Get back.
[00:46:56.501 --> 00:47:01.522]  File blurb reports at InfoWars and Prison Planet as articles.
[00:47:01.522 --> 00:47:08.803]  We'll then take those and put them into master articles for Drudge and others that I know are standing by for this breaking news coverage.
[00:47:08.803 --> 00:47:15.665]  So, spend another 20 minutes there and then get back to the hotel and file your reports because obviously
[00:47:16.405 --> 00:47:18.026]  Oh, I think that makes perfect sense, Alex.
[00:47:46.664 --> 00:47:47.004]  Well, no.
[00:47:47.004 --> 00:47:49.745]  I mean, do you think that's a good idea?
[00:47:49.745 --> 00:47:57.889]  Yeah, we'll stake this area out for another 20 minutes, and then we will head back to the hotel for a high-quality connection for later in the program.
[00:47:57.889 --> 00:48:02.151]  And I'm sure by then we're going to know even more, because there's limos constantly coming in.
[00:48:02.151 --> 00:48:07.054]  A lot of them are empty, but I believe they keep them in a continuous loop.
[00:48:07.054 --> 00:48:10.335]  That way, any arrivees don't have to be inconvenienced, for one thing.
[00:48:10.335 --> 00:48:15.098]  Also, if they need to access other areas without being seen, you know.
[00:48:16.398 --> 00:48:19.580]  We have the 2000 super zoom video camera.
[00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:25.963]  Obviously you guys are staking out a good place to start early in the morning when the global scum arrives in mass.
[00:48:25.963 --> 00:48:29.585]  Just like I got footage of Queen Beatrix and David Rockefeller and others.
[00:48:29.585 --> 00:48:33.186]  So obviously find a good catbird seat.
[00:48:33.186 --> 00:48:35.868]  You can get on a mountaintop and zoom in on their faces with that camera we got.
[00:48:36.977 --> 00:48:44.483]  Yeah, it's an excellent camera, and it's worth noting, by the way, there's no true freedom of the press or freedom of speech here.
[00:48:44.483 --> 00:48:52.550]  The police are asking for passports in many cases, and we've learned from our sources, if you refuse, you can be arrested on the spot.
[00:48:52.550 --> 00:48:54.932]  So that's another aspect of the police state area.
[00:48:54.932 --> 00:48:58.315]  Yeah, they took Luke's passport for 30 minutes.
[00:48:58.315 --> 00:48:58.996]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:48:58.996 --> 00:49:01.377]  Did you witness that happen?
[00:49:01.377 --> 00:49:04.200]  That was before we got here, so, but he told us about it.
[00:49:05.623 --> 00:49:06.583]  Absolutely incredible.
[00:49:06.583 --> 00:49:08.064]  Well, that's an important thing.
[00:49:08.064 --> 00:49:10.284]  RT is there and working for RT.
[00:49:10.284 --> 00:49:19.227]  RT Reporter, passport taken, which for those that don't know, that means he was detained because he couldn't travel or get out of Switzerland without it.
[00:49:19.227 --> 00:49:21.627]  And they did threaten to arrest him, from what I understand.
[00:49:21.627 --> 00:49:24.228]  Okay, we'll need to get all that intel to Kurt, who I know is listening.
[00:49:24.228 --> 00:49:33.331]  So, RT Reporter, if we need to add that as update blurbs to your article, Matt Ryan, RT Reporter,
[00:49:35.799 --> 00:49:40.445]  Yeah, that's just for standing in an area very similar, very close to where I'm standing right now, Alex.
[00:49:48.459 --> 00:50:11.224]  Meanwhile, Obama offers bailout for Greece, which means a bailout to Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, that the president of Greece on the Goldman Sachs payroll, their former finance minister, they set all this up two years ago, bragged about it, that's been in mainstream news, and so more of our tax money to Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan for their, you know, hundreds of billions in profits and bonuses.
[00:50:11.224 --> 00:50:12.084]  This is insane.
[00:50:12.084 --> 00:50:13.044]  Aaron, you were about to say something?
[00:50:14.022 --> 00:50:27.676]  And of course all those banks that were bailed out, or at least a great deal of them, were directly CEO'd or chaired by members of the Bilderberg Steering Group, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, the list goes on and on.
[00:50:27.676 --> 00:50:32.181]  People like Peter Sutherland, who was also BP and Royal Dutch Shell Chairman.
[00:50:32.181 --> 00:50:37.466]  These guys ran failed banks and they got bailed out and now they're the ones profiting from
[00:50:37.766 --> 00:50:38.607]  Well, Aaron, I know.
[00:50:38.607 --> 00:50:41.010]  Do you have a mini tripod to put that iPhone on it?
[00:50:41.010 --> 00:50:45.634]  You could zoom in there and get some photos of that and Twitter it right now to the InfoWars Twitter feed.
[00:50:45.634 --> 00:50:50.319]  Get that done, do whatever else you want, and get back to base and start filing reports.
[00:50:50.319 --> 00:50:53.942]  Filing reports comes before you joining us via video Skype.
[00:50:53.942 --> 00:50:54.623]  Stand by.
[00:50:54.623 --> 00:50:56.165]  I'll give you directions during the break.
[00:50:56.165 --> 00:50:58.887]  We'll come back with Matt Ryan, then Gerald Cilente coming up.
[00:50:58.887 --> 00:50:59.788]  Tons of global news.
[00:51:00.609 --> 00:51:01.910]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:07.514]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:51:07.514 --> 00:51:12.517]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:51:12.517 --> 00:51:18.101]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:51:18.101 --> 00:51:19.922]  So our friends at Solutions from Science
[00:51:20.202 --> 00:51:20.703]  We're good to go.
[00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:41.424]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:51:41.424 --> 00:51:43.646]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:51:43.646 --> 00:51:44.587]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:51:44.587 --> 00:51:44.787]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:51:44.787 --> 00:51:48.231]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:51:48.231 --> 00:51:49.993]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:52:01.494 --> 00:52:05.518]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:52:05.518 --> 00:52:08.762]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:52:08.762 --> 00:52:13.547]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:13.547 --> 00:52:19.954]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:19.954 --> 00:52:22.197]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:52:22.717 --> 00:52:23.017]  Tim Geithner?
[00:52:23.017 --> 00:52:23.517]  Bernanke?
[00:52:23.517 --> 00:52:23.897]  They're arsonists!
[00:52:23.897 --> 00:52:24.658]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:24.658 --> 00:52:26.338]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:41.624 --> 00:52:43.745]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:43.745 --> 00:52:48.888]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:52:48.888 --> 00:52:58.012]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:52:59.793 --> 00:53:05.017]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:54:04.181 --> 00:54:10.605]  Okay, Luke Radowski up there on the side of the mountain over where Bilderberg Group is meeting is just popping in with us for a few minutes.
[00:54:10.605 --> 00:54:14.167]  He'll be back later today with Aaron and Paul Watson all reporting.
[00:54:14.167 --> 00:54:22.192]  He is an RT Russia Today reporter, of course, founder of the organization We Are Change, anti-globalist organization.
[00:54:22.192 --> 00:54:27.675]  Briefly, Luke, tell us how they took your passport, why they did it, what happened?
[00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:31.461]  I mean, as soon as I came here, you know, I started making a little bit of noise.
[00:54:31.461 --> 00:54:35.802]  I tried to actually walk in there to have a dinner, and I got shoved by one of the police officers.
[00:54:35.802 --> 00:54:41.763]  And then 30 to 40 minutes after that, a whole bunch of police officers ran up on the crowd and demanding passports.
[00:54:41.763 --> 00:54:44.544]  They came up right to me, and they were like, we want his passport.
[00:54:44.544 --> 00:54:47.305]  We want to see your documents in their language.
[00:54:47.305 --> 00:54:48.485]  And we had somebody translate.
[00:54:48.885 --> 00:54:51.766]  I hear the private security company has an all-seeing eye as their symbol.
[00:55:15.376 --> 00:55:17.599]  Yeah, it's pretty Orwellian here.
[00:55:17.599 --> 00:55:21.284]  I mean, it's pretty crazy with the surveillance cameras and lights that they're setting up here.
[00:55:21.284 --> 00:55:23.186]  There's police officers all over the place.
[00:55:23.186 --> 00:55:28.133]  They even put up a white tarp so nobody could take photographs of the cars coming in here.
[00:55:28.133 --> 00:55:30.456]  Just like we, you know, previously documented matters.
[00:55:30.456 --> 00:55:31.097]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:55:31.277 --> 00:55:37.686]  They're rolling out the red carpet for the banksters to take all their stolen loot from us and bank it there.
[00:55:37.686 --> 00:55:43.333]  And you did catch, of course, Bernanke there years ago in Virginia, Madeleine Albright.
[00:55:43.333 --> 00:55:47.359]  So they're really rolling out the red carpet for him, it looks like, compared to anything we've ever seen, Luke.
[00:55:48.286 --> 00:55:50.828]  Exactly, and even I'm here talking to We Are Change Switzerland.
[00:55:50.828 --> 00:55:54.530]  They're telling me that this is a public street that they're blocking off.
[00:55:54.530 --> 00:56:02.394]  They're having private security teams working with the Swiss military and Swiss police blocking off a public sidewalk right here, threatening people with arrests.
[00:56:02.394 --> 00:56:04.756]  And we've been informed there's no freedom of speech here.
[00:56:04.756 --> 00:56:09.158]  There's no, uh, we have pretty much no right here, so we have to be pretty careful.
[00:56:09.158 --> 00:56:13.461]  But, you know, we're still going to stand our ground and we're going to document everything as we can.
[00:56:13.461 --> 00:56:17.143]  And we're going to try to send a message to the illegal banksters who are trying to
[00:56:19.344 --> 00:56:22.607]  No, this is the criminals.
[00:56:22.607 --> 00:56:23.868]  History's being made there.
[00:56:23.868 --> 00:56:28.371]  The resistance and the crimes they're committing inside the violation of the Logan Act with U.S.
[00:56:28.371 --> 00:56:29.032]  officials that go.
[00:56:29.032 --> 00:56:32.734]  Luke, we're going to be talking to you today if we can and over the next few days.
[00:56:32.734 --> 00:56:33.435]  Great job.
[00:56:33.435 --> 00:56:34.456]  God bless you.
[00:56:34.456 --> 00:56:38.799]  Folks, you can find him at Luke Rudowsky, WeAreChange at Facebook.
[00:56:38.799 --> 00:56:40.240]  God bless and be safe, Luke.
[00:56:41.923 --> 00:56:43.524]  All right, there goes Luke Hradowski.
[00:56:43.524 --> 00:56:48.549]  Going back to Matt Ryan, we got Gerald Cilente coming up about five after, eight after next hour.
[00:56:48.549 --> 00:56:50.931]  I got incredible global news.
[00:56:50.931 --> 00:56:52.713]  You've worked here a few years, Matt Ryan.
[00:56:52.713 --> 00:57:01.301]  It gets crazier and crazier every day now, where it's just, I've got literally over 100 articles here today that I could talk all day just about one of these.
[00:57:01.301 --> 00:57:04.604]  And there are the people that are setting it all up at this meeting.
[00:57:04.604 --> 00:57:08.067]  They're running things illegally, and there are the cops worshiping them.
[00:57:08.854 --> 00:57:17.618]  Right, and they're setting up basically a big ship, and they're saying you have to be one of us to be allowed to be on this ship while the rest of the world drowns.
[00:57:17.618 --> 00:57:18.598]  But you know what?
[00:57:18.598 --> 00:57:21.899]  Ships leak, and even the Titanic can sink.
[00:57:21.899 --> 00:57:22.780]  So we're gonna be there.
[00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:25.701]  We're down on the ground, and believe me, if there's a leak, we're gonna find it.
[00:57:26.468 --> 00:57:28.632]  Well, we've got intel inside as well.
[00:57:28.632 --> 00:57:30.094]  We've got incredible breaking news.
[00:57:30.094 --> 00:57:31.696]  We've got a codify into articles.
[00:57:31.696 --> 00:57:39.990]  Tell the radio listeners and satellite listeners out there about InfoWars.com and this special page that you're continually updating.
[00:57:40.612 --> 00:57:45.416]  Basically there's a page up on Infowars.com and the title of it, I'm sorry.
[00:57:45.416 --> 00:57:49.279]  Exclusive live video and photos from Bilderberg, continually updated.
[00:57:49.279 --> 00:58:01.390]  Right, on the top of the page you'll see a live video from Justin.tv which is basically Aaron Dykes, Paul Watson and the rest are down there and they're transmitting live throughout this conference.
[00:58:01.830 --> 00:58:26.711]  Right below that you'll see the Twitter feed from Real Alex Jones on Twitter and they are tied into that and if there if there's a photo or anything they need to get out in a hurry it's going to the Twitter so you'll be able to find that on that page and right below that all the articles we have about it all the photos that are taken everything in archives are going to be on that page it's a one-stop shop get the word out spread it get that link out to as many people as you know and let's spread the word about this
[00:58:27.131 --> 00:58:31.015]  Absolutely, because we're seeing a media blackout here in the United States.
[00:58:31.015 --> 00:58:32.677]  Let's break the blockade.
[00:58:32.677 --> 00:58:34.199]  We've done it before.
[00:58:34.199 --> 00:58:35.400]  We're going to do it again.
[00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:37.442]  We're going to do a keyword search coming up.
[00:58:37.442 --> 00:58:38.724]  Haven't done that in over a month.
[00:58:38.724 --> 00:58:44.290]  Stay with us.
[00:58:44.290 --> 00:58:48.034]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:51.360 --> 00:59:06.837]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:59:06.837 --> 00:59:10.521]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:59:11.519 --> 00:59:24.291]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:59:24.291 --> 00:59:31.558]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:59:32.239 --> 00:59:42.626]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:59:42.626 --> 00:59:46.548]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:59:46.548 --> 00:59:53.392]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:59:53.392 --> 00:59:55.774]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.774 --> 00:59:58.536]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.168 --> 01:00:09.991]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.991 --> 01:00:11.592]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.592 --> 01:00:13.133]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.133 --> 01:00:17.335]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.335 --> 01:00:21.397]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.498 --> 01:00:34.122]  Gerald Salente, one of the top trends forecasters, researchers out there, will be joining us coming up in the next segment to cover all of the huge global developments.
[01:00:34.122 --> 01:00:38.664]  Obama wants to get more of your tax money to, quote, bail out the Greeks.
[01:00:38.664 --> 01:00:40.105]  The Greeks are being sucked dry.
[01:00:40.105 --> 01:00:41.826]  They don't owe the lion's share of the money.
[01:00:42.426 --> 01:00:52.118]  They tied their pension funds into the IMF and World Bank private banking consortium and they're holding everyone hostage and the criminals that are running this are meeting in St.
[01:00:52.118 --> 01:00:53.599]  Moritz, Switzerland.
[01:00:53.599 --> 01:00:56.202]  We've got two of our great dogged reporters.
[01:00:57.168 --> 01:01:05.092]  We've got Paul Watson of PrisonPlanet.com, Aaron Dykes of InfoWars.com with live video streaming, photos, all going up on the Twitter feed.
[01:01:05.092 --> 01:01:16.478]  It's all available at InfoWars.com, exclusive live video and photos from Bilderberg, continually updated, so it's all there and available to everyone right now.
[01:01:16.478 --> 01:01:18.159]  Please get that link out to everyone you know.
[01:01:18.159 --> 01:01:19.840]  We're going to have in that one
[01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:20.841]  Thank you.
[01:01:39.796 --> 01:01:41.117]  I mean, it is getting insane.
[01:01:41.117 --> 01:01:49.162]  We've got Open USA Today, you name it, talking about the end of the dollar, defaults on trillions.
[01:01:49.162 --> 01:01:50.122]  The bankers do this.
[01:01:50.122 --> 01:01:52.904]  They implode you, then they take over even more.
[01:01:55.558 --> 01:01:57.519]  Just so much happening.
[01:01:57.519 --> 01:02:04.944]  And then I've got other bizarre, bizarre articles up at InfoWars.com confirmed from the Idaho statesman.
[01:02:04.944 --> 01:02:07.426]  Big boil down on this from the American Dream.
[01:02:07.426 --> 01:02:12.549]  China wants to construct a 50 square mile self-sustaining city south of Boise, Idaho.
[01:02:12.549 --> 01:02:16.372]  This is what Mexico and the North American Union tried to do in Kansas City.
[01:02:16.372 --> 01:02:20.455]  This is the new model of these globalist free trade zones where they're above the laws.
[01:02:20.455 --> 01:02:21.615]  Nothing gets searched.
[01:02:21.615 --> 01:02:22.756]  They can bring in whatever they want.
[01:02:22.756 --> 01:02:24.477]  They can leverage out all the local businesses.
[01:02:25.738 --> 01:02:30.241]  It's the same model of the insiders being above the law and basically having diplomatic immunity.
[01:02:30.241 --> 01:02:32.523]  These are diplomatic zones.
[01:02:32.523 --> 01:02:53.078]  And it's the same thing with the two big DeFel banks getting our tax money, General Electric chairing the Economic Commission in the White House getting a waiver for their power plants nobody else does as the government shuts down their competition, Obama giving waivers to thousands of big companies that give him money where they don't have to get insurance but we do for our employees.
[01:02:53.078 --> 01:02:53.679]  I mean it is
[01:02:54.179 --> 01:02:56.220]  Total mafia takeover.
[01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:57.620]  That's what world government is.
[01:02:57.620 --> 01:03:03.982]  Is government by a corrupt corporate mafia who are waging war against the free market system.
[01:03:03.982 --> 01:03:06.203]  This is so off the charts.
[01:03:06.203 --> 01:03:15.566]  And to see the incredible expense of the militarized Swiss police, you know, going after the citizens like they're scum.
[01:03:15.566 --> 01:03:20.227]  The Swiss people are good folks and they have a good Second Amendment system that our Second Amendment is based on.
[01:03:21.988 --> 01:03:22.048]  And
[01:03:40.718 --> 01:03:46.259]  These individuals, many of them make billions a year through these brokerage firms and banks.
[01:03:46.259 --> 01:03:52.561]  They steal from us on record and they haul it back to Switzerland and here are the globalists protecting them.
[01:03:52.561 --> 01:03:56.742]  So you know why I didn't announce that Aaron Dykes and Paul Watson were going to be on the ground.
[01:03:56.742 --> 01:04:00.942]  I wanted them, that was even guarded here in the office.
[01:04:00.942 --> 01:04:03.203]  I have real trouble keeping things secret.
[01:04:03.203 --> 01:04:07.504]  That's why I said we're going to have our guys reporting on the reporters that are going to be there.
[01:04:08.244 --> 01:04:09.724]  Aaron Dykes and Paul Watson.
[01:04:09.724 --> 01:04:13.485]  And my wife heard it and basically took it that they would be there a few days ago.
[01:04:13.485 --> 01:04:18.846]  So I just really can't even lie when I try, folks.
[01:04:18.846 --> 01:04:24.967]  But the point is, this is big news and we're fighting back.
[01:04:24.967 --> 01:04:33.349]  And if we can get the world to awaken to these people, there's a reason the controlled globalist dinosaur media doesn't want you to know they're there.
[01:04:33.349 --> 01:04:36.990]  One of the other agendas last year, and importantly this year, is how to take over the Internet.
[01:04:37.250 --> 01:04:38.851]  How to shut down free speech.
[01:04:38.851 --> 01:04:42.572]  Because they can't have us identifying them as the criminals that have done it.
[01:04:42.572 --> 01:04:47.194]  If we can identify these people to the general public... Remember, just four or five years ago it didn't exist.
[01:04:47.194 --> 01:04:48.654]  The media would make fun of you for this.
[01:04:48.654 --> 01:04:51.676]  Just three years ago the New York Times said I was crazy.
[01:04:51.676 --> 01:04:53.416]  And didn't cover Bilderberg.
[01:04:53.416 --> 01:04:54.097]  Okay?
[01:04:54.097 --> 01:04:57.158]  Because they're desperate to keep this information from you.
[01:04:57.158 --> 01:04:58.378]  They're desperate!
[01:04:58.378 --> 01:04:59.659]  Gerald Solense coming up!
[01:05:00.455 --> 01:05:04.998]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:04.998 --> 01:05:05.918]  Number 1.
[01:05:05.918 --> 01:05:09.341]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:09.341 --> 01:05:10.201]  Number 2.
[01:05:10.201 --> 01:05:15.104]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:15.104 --> 01:05:15.845]  It's true.
[01:05:15.845 --> 01:05:20.708]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:20.708 --> 01:05:21.548]  Number 3.
[01:05:21.548 --> 01:05:25.131]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:25.131 --> 01:05:28.833]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:29.033 --> 01:05:29.814]  Number 4.
[01:05:29.814 --> 01:05:32.577]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:32.577 --> 01:05:36.261]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:36.261 --> 01:05:37.062]  Number 5.
[01:05:37.062 --> 01:05:41.207]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:05:41.207 --> 01:05:45.972]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:05:46.252 --> 01:05:50.414]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:50.414 --> 01:05:52.215]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:05:57.078 --> 01:06:07.343]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:06:07.343 --> 01:06:12.486]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:06:12.486 --> 01:06:14.347]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[01:06:16.536 --> 01:06:21.202]  Well, they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:06:21.202 --> 01:06:25.267]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:06:25.267 --> 01:06:27.550]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[01:06:29.691 --> 01:06:34.275]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[01:06:34.275 --> 01:06:38.138]  Blue Diamond Gussets, got it.
[01:06:38.138 --> 01:06:39.359]  Others don't.
[01:06:39.359 --> 01:06:41.501]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:06:41.501 --> 01:06:43.282]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:06:43.282 --> 01:06:46.184]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:06:46.184 --> 01:06:52.810]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.

[01:06:57.874 --> 01:06:58.695]  Others don't.
[01:07:00.106 --> 01:07:05.510]  You've heard Alex Jones talk about eFoods Direct and their highly nutritious, long-term, storable food.
[01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:06.991]  Believe me, it tastes great.

[01:08:00.985 --> 01:08:03.767]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:03.767 --> 01:08:06.548]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:16.032 --> 01:08:17.152]  We are live.
[01:08:17.152 --> 01:08:19.373]  So much is happening.
[01:08:19.373 --> 01:08:21.414]  The world really is awakening.
[01:08:21.414 --> 01:08:23.615]  You know, I'm the keynote speaker.
[01:08:23.615 --> 01:08:26.656]  Past keynote speakers have been Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity.
[01:08:26.656 --> 01:08:30.558]  I'm told some of those folks are going to be there at Talker's main event in New York.
[01:08:31.570 --> 01:08:38.712]  Friday and Saturday, I'm speaking Saturday morning as the keynote speaker of the event, March 2001.
[01:08:38.712 --> 01:08:45.714]  They did the cover story, Alex Jones, keynote speaker, fastest growing radio show in the country, according to analysis that's been done.
[01:08:45.714 --> 01:08:49.035]  A lot of folks claim they're the fastest this, the fastest that.
[01:08:49.035 --> 01:08:50.275]  We are.
[01:08:50.275 --> 01:08:53.416]  And that's why we have such incredible responsibility.
[01:08:54.284 --> 01:08:56.326]  And I couldn't have done any of this without my great team.
[01:08:56.326 --> 01:09:00.750]  I couldn't have done any of this without you, the listeners, spreading the word.
[01:09:00.750 --> 01:09:08.396]  And we are going to have, we already have incredible video reports, live streaming video, the live Twitter feed with high-def photos.
[01:09:08.396 --> 01:09:12.480]  And we've got all this breaking news is going to be codified into articles.
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:20.066]  We're streaming live video of the guys driving around the Bilderberg Group Hotel, where the Global Crime Syndicate is meeting in St.
[01:09:20.066 --> 01:09:20.386]  Moritz.
[01:09:21.207 --> 01:09:31.134]  The police did detain for 40 minutes Luke Radowski and RT reporter and took his passport and threatened to arrest him and interrogated him.
[01:09:31.134 --> 01:09:35.077]  So that's big news that we're going to get Kurt Nemo to get a blur about on.
[01:09:37.008 --> 01:09:41.970]  We're going to do, coming up at the bottom of the hour, we haven't done this in a month, a Google bomb.
[01:09:41.970 --> 01:09:46.512]  But I need to get an article out with it in the headline before I choose the term.
[01:09:46.512 --> 01:09:50.034]  Start your engines collectively to rush the globalists.
[01:09:50.034 --> 01:09:51.655]  We've got that happening.
[01:09:51.655 --> 01:09:56.437]  But a lot of the people attending this have indictments out on them, like Henry Kissinger in France.
[01:09:57.157 --> 01:10:03.241]  And one of the top members of their government, the equivalent of their Congress, it was in Swiss News Monday.
[01:10:03.241 --> 01:10:14.369]  Drudge picked up our article on it, called for the arrest of Henry Kissinger for the convictions he has in some countries for war crimes and the French indictment of this year.
[01:10:14.369 --> 01:10:18.992]  George Soros can't go because of all the indictments and convictions in Europe on him.
[01:10:18.992 --> 01:10:20.713]  I mean, this is a mafia.
[01:10:20.713 --> 01:10:25.516]  This is people think of the mafia, some Italians sitting around in a farmhouse.
[01:10:25.516 --> 01:10:26.637]  That's a low level mafia.
[01:10:27.277 --> 01:10:31.481]  Okay, this is the Dutch royalty, the British royalty, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers.
[01:10:31.481 --> 01:10:38.326]  These are the people that Obama is calling for hundreds of billions more of US taxpayer money to quote, bail out Greece.
[01:10:38.326 --> 01:10:43.430]  But it's admitted in Greece and in Europe, 91% of it is not owed by the Greek people.
[01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:51.417]  Their pension funds are tied in to the investments Goldman Sachs and others who took over their government two years ago, set them up to fall.
[01:10:51.417 --> 01:10:53.098]  Now they're taking the country over.
[01:10:53.098 --> 01:10:56.281]  Some brokerage heads, one guy who's owed three billion, is getting
[01:10:56.741 --> 01:11:00.344]  Huge islands, individually from the government.
[01:11:00.344 --> 01:11:07.290]  He sells them fraud, controls their government, Papandreouf, and then has them hand it all over to them.
[01:11:07.290 --> 01:11:08.851]  That's how evil these people are.
[01:11:08.851 --> 01:11:11.273]  They're the ones that want global population reduction.
[01:11:11.273 --> 01:11:13.234]  They're the ones that want all of this.
[01:11:13.234 --> 01:11:18.459]  They're the people that admittedly want to shut down the free press, and openly we've gotten their documents where they want it.
[01:11:18.459 --> 01:11:22.162]  They're the ones that want a global government, and our people are covering it there.
[01:11:22.842 --> 01:11:29.985]  Right now, in Switzerland, we'll have continual coverage of that at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:11:29.985 --> 01:11:35.787]  Now, for the rest of the hour, we're joined by the premier, Trends forecaster, Gerald Solente.
[01:11:35.787 --> 01:11:41.049]  He said last year that by the end of the year, it would be evident that the dollar was dying, that we were in a depression.
[01:11:41.049 --> 01:11:44.591]  Well, then the media didn't admit there was a depression, and they said, oh, Gerald's wrong.
[01:11:45.171 --> 01:11:56.460]  But look at the London Independent analysis, the London Guardian, the Associated Press, all the news this week says we're worse than depression level housing slump, worse than depression level job losses.
[01:11:56.460 --> 01:11:58.221]  They've been cooking the numbers.
[01:11:58.221 --> 01:11:59.943]  There never was a recovery.
[01:11:59.943 --> 01:12:01.524]  So the hoax is breaking.
[01:12:01.524 --> 01:12:03.065]  Gerald Cilente was right.
[01:12:03.065 --> 01:12:04.647]  He wasn't wrong.
[01:12:04.647 --> 01:12:07.749]  The Arabs are saying they're not going to increase output of oil.
[01:12:07.749 --> 01:12:09.651]  All of that is happening.
[01:12:09.651 --> 01:12:11.672]  We've got a lot of intel from inside the Bilderberg Group.
[01:12:11.672 --> 01:12:12.513]  I'll go over later in the
[01:12:12.973 --> 01:12:13.474]  I don't know.
[01:12:33.857 --> 01:12:37.101]  And his audio cut out.
[01:12:37.101 --> 01:12:38.023]  We'll go to him.
[01:12:38.023 --> 01:12:42.008]  Video Skype's great for the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, and the audio quality's better.
[01:12:42.008 --> 01:12:43.029]  That's why we do it.
[01:12:43.029 --> 01:12:48.316]  But sometimes the technology can be a bit jumpy, obviously, as you've seen from our folks reporting.
[01:12:48.316 --> 01:12:48.836]  But what's great...
[01:12:49.577 --> 01:12:50.959]  We have Gerald Cilente with us.
[01:12:50.959 --> 01:13:08.157]  Gerald, here are the global crime syndicate, white shoe boys as you call them, meeting openly, most of them the heads of the banks that are looting us, and the police are treating reporters like scum and threatening to arrest them and snatching their passports from them.
[01:13:08.157 --> 01:13:08.938]  Gerald Cilente.
[01:13:10.049 --> 01:13:15.212]  Well, you know what I used to say over and over again, and people didn't want to hear it.
[01:13:15.212 --> 01:13:22.577]  If the names on Wall Street were named Solenti, Caruso, Mondavi, Puccini, Rossini, they'd call it the Mafia.
[01:13:22.577 --> 01:13:26.659]  But as you point out, you can't call the White Shoe Boys crooks and criminals.
[01:13:26.659 --> 01:13:34.484]  Oh no, they dress nice, and they have good language, and they go to Harvard, Princeton, Yale, and Oxford Neaton Boys.
[01:13:34.484 --> 01:13:35.885]  Oh no, they're proper.
[01:13:36.525 --> 01:13:38.506]  You know, they're raping this country.
[01:13:38.506 --> 01:13:40.828]  International Monetary Fund.
[01:13:40.828 --> 01:13:50.715]  You know, if Dominique Strauss-Kahn is allegedly guilty of raping that woman, it's just what the IMF does.
[01:13:50.715 --> 01:13:53.957]  They're either raping a person or raping a country.
[01:13:53.957 --> 01:13:55.578]  You pointed it out.
[01:13:55.578 --> 01:13:57.580]  They call it privatization.
[01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:04.625]  They, what they do is they force countries into bankruptcy by their banking deals.
[01:14:04.625 --> 01:14:09.169]  And as you also pointed out, who do the Greek people owe this money to?
[01:14:09.169 --> 01:14:15.174]  Oh, the German and French banks and other criminal groups that made bad bets and they can't lose.
[01:14:15.174 --> 01:14:16.655]  So what are they doing?
[01:14:16.655 --> 01:14:18.316]  Well, we have to privatize.
[01:14:18.316 --> 01:14:19.657]  Privatize?
[01:14:19.657 --> 01:14:21.799]  Oh, again, white shoe boy language.
[01:14:21.799 --> 01:14:26.142]  That means taking expensive public resources
[01:14:27.023 --> 01:14:30.444]  And selling them very cheaply to your buddies.
[01:14:30.444 --> 01:14:39.247]  So what we're looking at here, Alex, is really criminal activity that's in front of all of us.
[01:14:39.247 --> 01:14:43.449]  And you nailed it, and what you're doing is terrific by exposing it.
[01:14:43.449 --> 01:14:51.612]  And as you well point out, I remember 20 years ago, there was this little newspaper, I think it was called Liberty Lobby, and they used to write about the Bilderbergs.
[01:14:51.832 --> 01:14:52.913]  And nobody believed them.
[01:14:52.913 --> 01:14:56.456]  Nobody... Oh, they were these crazy people.
[01:14:56.456 --> 01:14:58.378]  The takeover has happened.
[01:14:58.378 --> 01:14:59.840]  And it's not socialism.
[01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:01.721]  I make this really clear.
[01:15:01.721 --> 01:15:07.066]  The merger of state and corporate powers is called fascism.
[01:15:07.066 --> 01:15:15.274]  And all the police are, the ones that you are talking about, the police in the countries around the world are nothing more
[01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:20.782]  than enforcers for the government crime bosses.
[01:15:20.782 --> 01:15:25.925]  The morality of the police is disgusting, is what's happened.
[01:15:25.925 --> 01:15:37.890]  As you pointed out, that video about breaking down the door at 6 o'clock in the morning because the guy didn't pay his wife, didn't pay his student loan, one after another.
[01:15:37.890 --> 01:15:45.414]  So the people better stand up because boy oh boy, the steamroller's ready to roll and they're gonna roll you over.
[01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:53.622]  Gerald, for those that don't know, the footage is up at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:15:53.622 --> 01:15:58.103]  The Department of Education, the feds have basically federalized all local police.
[01:15:58.103 --> 01:16:03.425]  They just show up and order them to SWAT team someone when debtor prisons are illegal.
[01:16:03.425 --> 01:16:07.687]  But I see articles every day where they're arresting people for unpaid debts.
[01:16:07.687 --> 01:16:11.328]  And then I see the article where the police did do their job in Florida.
[01:16:12.068 --> 01:16:31.644]  Where for five months the bank said you never owned the house, that people paid cash, Bank of America, you don't have a deed, you took their luxury home, and finally the police did the right thing and did their job, and when they went into the bank to seize the Bank of America branch and take the money out of the bank to pay them their hundreds of thousands back,
[01:16:32.549 --> 01:16:38.173]  Under court order, the banker reportedly said, well, you can't do this, we're Bank of America.
[01:16:38.173 --> 01:16:45.138]  These guys think, and they've committed so many crimes, that they're God and can do this, but their comeuppance is coming.
[01:16:45.138 --> 01:16:55.345]  The awakening is happening to these criminals, and Bank of America is part of the big global six megabanks that own the IMF and World Bank, and that own the Federal Reserve shares.
[01:16:55.345 --> 01:16:59.248]  And the people are identifying them, and the people are awakening.
[01:17:00.589 --> 01:17:01.670]  Well, they'd better awake.
[01:17:01.670 --> 01:17:14.939]  You know, I just heard James Carville, the Democratic strategist, and he's now saying what I said two years ago was going to happen, but of course now it's making news, and they're not calling him crazy.
[01:17:14.939 --> 01:17:17.981]  Imminent civil unrest.
[01:17:17.981 --> 01:17:18.601]  Exactly.
[01:17:18.601 --> 01:17:21.123]  You know I've been saying this for how long?
[01:17:21.123 --> 01:17:23.024]  And that's what's going to happen.
[01:17:23.024 --> 01:17:25.086]  You know, it's very simple.
[01:17:25.086 --> 01:17:26.667]  I've been giving this a lot of thought.
[01:17:27.728 --> 01:17:33.629]  The only way this is going to change, we're not going to have a third party, it's rigged against us.
[01:17:33.629 --> 01:17:35.930]  Let the people vote.
[01:17:35.930 --> 01:17:37.590]  Let the people vote.
[01:17:37.590 --> 01:17:44.431]  Every major issue, war, bailouts, immigration, let the people vote.
[01:17:44.431 --> 01:17:46.292]  You talked about Switzerland.
[01:17:46.292 --> 01:17:48.272]  What do they have in Switzerland?
[01:17:48.272 --> 01:17:53.313]  Other than the money cockroaches, what they have in Switzerland is direct democracy.
[01:17:54.013 --> 01:17:57.979]  The representatives in this country don't represent us.
[01:17:57.979 --> 01:18:00.042]  Let's make this really clear.
[01:18:00.042 --> 01:18:05.570]  What they call campaign contributions, you know, that's kiddie talk.
[01:18:05.570 --> 01:18:07.994]  For bribes and payoffs.
[01:18:07.994 --> 01:18:09.376]  Let the people vote.
[01:18:10.117 --> 01:18:13.819]  Let the people vote on every issue.
[01:18:13.819 --> 01:18:16.981]  We do not have a representative form of government.
[01:18:16.981 --> 01:18:18.581]  It's a takeover.
[01:18:18.581 --> 01:18:21.583]  Washington is controlled by Wall Street.
[01:18:21.583 --> 01:18:25.365]  The only way I see it changing, Alex, if you go back to TARP,
[01:18:25.825 --> 01:18:27.866]  The people would have never voted for it.
[01:18:27.866 --> 01:18:32.507]  If you put the war on Libya in front of the people, they would never vote for it.
[01:18:32.507 --> 01:18:37.169]  If you put up, do you want to keep the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan going?
[01:18:37.169 --> 01:18:39.009]  The people won't vote for it.
[01:18:39.009 --> 01:18:41.290]  That's the only way I see out of this.
[01:18:41.290 --> 01:18:43.571]  A direct democracy on major issues.
[01:18:45.947 --> 01:18:52.990]  Well, you're absolutely right, and in every case in history, tyrants' undoing is that they reach too far.
[01:18:52.990 --> 01:18:57.012]  They get away with so much that they think they can do whatever they want.
[01:18:57.012 --> 01:18:58.212]  It's like Weiner.
[01:18:58.212 --> 01:19:09.457]  I mean, what type of person in their right mind, especially a prominent person, would be sending hundreds of photos of their member out to women, and then when Andrew Breitbart comes out
[01:19:10.413 --> 01:19:10.493]  And
[01:19:25.467 --> 01:19:26.528]  Andrew Breitbart.
[01:19:26.528 --> 01:19:31.531]  I mean, these guys... But Alex, Alex, who does his wife work for?
[01:19:31.531 --> 01:19:33.332]  Hillary.
[01:19:33.332 --> 01:19:35.994]  And don't you remember the Bill story?
[01:19:35.994 --> 01:19:39.797]  Well, she's the special... Well, Bill said Hillary... ...made up the monocle of whiskey.
[01:19:39.797 --> 01:19:42.198]  I didn't have sex with that woman's story.
[01:19:42.198 --> 01:19:45.080]  I smoked, but I didn't inhale Bill Clinton.
[01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:46.962]  This is what they do all the time.
[01:19:46.962 --> 01:19:49.043]  What's the surprise?
[01:19:49.043 --> 01:19:50.784]  I've said it over and over again.
[01:19:50.784 --> 01:19:51.585]  Stay there, we got a break.
[01:19:52.125 --> 01:19:52.645]  Got a break.
[01:19:52.645 --> 01:19:53.466]  Incredible.
[01:19:53.466 --> 01:19:54.446]  Gerald Celente straight ahead.
[01:19:54.446 --> 01:19:56.547]  We'll cover the spectrum of news.
[01:19:56.547 --> 01:20:01.070]  Stay with us.

[01:21:02.819 --> 01:21:09.083]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:21:09.083 --> 01:21:13.266]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:21:13.266 --> 01:21:15.207]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:21:15.207 --> 01:21:17.649]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:21:17.649 --> 01:21:24.753]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every
[01:21:24.773 --> 01:21:34.799]  Every day Midas Resources is proud to offer the hard-hitting report that arms you with the truth you need to protect you and your family from the Fed's plans for your hard-earned money.

[01:21:56.892 --> 01:22:01.137]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:22:01.137 --> 01:22:06.722]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:22:06.722 --> 01:22:11.747]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:22:11.747 --> 01:22:16.773]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:22:17.293 --> 01:22:22.517]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:22:22.517 --> 01:22:24.839]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:22:24.839 --> 01:22:29.643]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:22:29.643 --> 01:22:30.764]  And here's the best part.
[01:22:30.764 --> 01:22:33.846]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:22:33.846 --> 01:22:37.129]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:22:37.449 --> 01:22:40.632]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:22:40.632 --> 01:22:42.855]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:22:42.855 --> 01:22:43.735]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:22:43.735 --> 01:22:43.996]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:22:43.996 --> 01:22:47.439]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:22:47.439 --> 01:22:49.181]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:22:59.622 --> 01:23:04.168]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about a product the drug companies don't want you to know about.
[01:23:04.168 --> 01:23:05.910]  It's called Osteo-K.
[01:23:05.910 --> 01:23:13.380]  Osteo-K is an osteoporosis supplement shown to decrease fractures 87% without any of the dangerous side effects of medications.
[01:23:13.380 --> 01:23:14.402]  Calcium and vitamin D
[01:23:14.582 --> 01:23:16.924]  We only decrease fractures by 16%.
[01:23:16.924 --> 01:23:20.447]  Osteo-K decreases fractures an astounding 87%.
[01:23:20.447 --> 01:23:22.989]  Friends, osteoporosis is a deadly disease.
[01:23:22.989 --> 01:23:27.533]  Research shows the most effective approach for protecting your bones is not a drug at all.
[01:23:27.533 --> 01:23:30.795]  It's Osteo-K, manufactured entirely in America.
[01:23:30.795 --> 01:23:35.479]  Osteo-K is available without a prescription and comes with an unconditional money-back guarantee.
[01:23:35.479 --> 01:23:41.624]  Don't wait until it's too late, because if you have osteoporosis and fracture a hip, you have a 20% chance of dying within a year.
[01:23:41.964 --> 01:23:44.226]  I urge you to take charge of your health today.
[01:23:44.226 --> 01:23:46.449]  I cannot recommend this breakthrough product enough.

[01:24:20.018 --> 01:24:20.899]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:24:20.899 --> 01:24:23.081]  Gerald Salenta is our guest.
[01:24:23.081 --> 01:24:36.911]  Up on our Twitter feed that you can follow at InfoWars.com, we have a big headline area there that says, Exclusive Continually Updated Area.
[01:24:38.152 --> 01:24:47.958]  At InfoWars.com, we're also going to get the special page posted up at PrisonPlanet.com that has links to our live video feeds, photo feeds, and so much more.
[01:24:47.958 --> 01:25:01.266]  But we now have the blown-up photos of the concentration camp-style floodlights, the special pod, tripods with cameras every 10, 15 feet or so.
[01:25:01.266 --> 01:25:03.767]  That's all up there right now.
[01:25:03.767 --> 01:25:04.648]  And we do have
[01:25:06.118 --> 01:25:06.959]  We're good to go.
[01:25:19.932 --> 01:25:29.440]  And we also have the intel, Trust But Verify, confirming that the West is behind trying to trigger a lot of these Arab uprisings to drive up oil prices, start a larger regional war.
[01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:41.971]  As you said a year ago, they would try to trigger a war as a political smokescreen so we'd rally around them, that they're upset that Congress is starting to wake up to the fact that Obama didn't have congressional approval and used UN authority to do it.
[01:25:41.971 --> 01:25:44.994]  They want a wider giant war in the Middle East.
[01:25:44.994 --> 01:25:46.475]  This is directly from inside.
[01:25:47.728 --> 01:25:58.703]  They want continued bailouts, not just to Greece, but they want to secure unlimited trillions and a second round of profiteering that they call bailouts, so that's being haggled over.
[01:25:58.703 --> 01:26:02.528]  They're picking the new IMF head, even Swiss press has reported that.
[01:26:03.129 --> 01:26:06.490]  But this is all very newsworthy here, but no, you won't see it in the U.S.
[01:26:06.490 --> 01:26:08.651]  other than Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:26:08.651 --> 01:26:11.732]  We hope the drugs report picks all this up as it develops.
[01:26:11.732 --> 01:26:28.237]  Also, they want to go after the alternative media, and we see inside, mirrored by public, Sarkozy and others two weeks ago at the EU meeting, Gerald, openly saying that they do want to clamp down on the freedom of the press and the web and start censoring people and taxing the web.
[01:26:30.578 --> 01:26:34.606]  This is big news, and they're trying to get their carbon tax through.
[01:26:34.606 --> 01:26:36.069]  All that from inside Bilderberg.
[01:26:36.069 --> 01:26:37.171]  What's your take on that agenda?
[01:26:38.171 --> 01:26:41.874]  Well, it's the agenda that's been going on now for quite some time.
[01:26:41.874 --> 01:26:49.019]  First of all, let's look at the, they have to continue to print the digital money, not work the paper it's not printed on.
[01:26:49.019 --> 01:26:52.961]  So that's why we still believe gold 2000 and above.
[01:26:52.961 --> 01:26:57.545]  You saw the unemployment numbers last week, worse than expected.
[01:26:57.545 --> 01:27:04.810]  And I love the language again, the white shoe boy language, that economists are downgrading their forecast.
[01:27:04.810 --> 01:27:05.931]  Downgrading?
[01:27:05.931 --> 01:27:07.592]  You mean they got it wrong?
[01:27:08.152 --> 01:27:09.953]  No, no, they downgrade.
[01:27:09.953 --> 01:27:13.875]  When we get something wrong, oh, then it's wrong, but not them.
[01:27:13.875 --> 01:27:16.777]  And then let's keep going on here, Alex.
[01:27:16.777 --> 01:27:25.882]  They've already historically engineered the first great war of the 21st century that we said was going to begin and has begun.
[01:27:25.882 --> 01:27:27.623]  Now they're calling it, I love it.
[01:27:28.283 --> 01:27:30.864]  Pro-democracy movements.
[01:27:30.864 --> 01:27:32.685]  Pro-democracy movements?
[01:27:32.685 --> 01:27:35.527]  This has nothing to do about democracy.
[01:27:35.527 --> 01:27:38.468]  It has to do with a lot of angry people.
[01:27:38.468 --> 01:27:41.149]  A lot of angry Greeks.
[01:27:41.149 --> 01:27:44.131]  A lot of angry Tunisians and Egyptians.
[01:27:44.631 --> 01:27:48.533]  A lot of angry Bahrainis from Yemen.
[01:27:48.533 --> 01:27:50.774]  And what's the same story?
[01:27:50.774 --> 01:27:52.475]  Young people.
[01:27:52.475 --> 01:27:53.095]  Spain.
[01:27:53.095 --> 01:27:57.717]  50, 45, 50 percent unemployment.
[01:27:57.717 --> 01:28:00.439]  With university degrees and worthlessness.
[01:28:01.139 --> 01:28:04.160]  No future in front of them.
[01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:12.102]  And the past has been stolen and continues to be stolen by the corrupt few at the top.
[01:28:12.102 --> 01:28:14.883]  The Goldman Sachs gang.
[01:28:14.883 --> 01:28:17.703]  The Credit Suisse boys.
[01:28:17.703 --> 01:28:19.904]  The Deutsche Bank bandits.
[01:28:20.724 --> 01:28:23.126]  One criminal group after another.
[01:28:23.126 --> 01:28:35.914]  How about that lovely, lovely guy, Steve Schwarzman, that's bringing down the healthcare system as we speak right now in England.
[01:28:35.914 --> 01:28:37.475]  Steve Schwarzman?
[01:28:37.475 --> 01:28:41.637]  Oh, the CEO of the Blackstone Group?
[01:28:41.637 --> 01:28:48.302]  Who, when they were going to raise the tax rate for hedge funds, he said, quote,
[01:28:49.355 --> 01:28:56.601]  It's the equivalent of Adolf Hitler invading Poland in 1939.
[01:28:56.601 --> 01:29:00.104]  These are the people that are robbing us blind.
[01:29:00.104 --> 01:29:03.567]  So what they're saying, it's a pro-democracy movement.
[01:29:03.567 --> 01:29:05.729]  This has nothing to do with democracy.
[01:29:05.729 --> 01:29:08.071]  This has to do with a lot of angry people.
[01:29:08.311 --> 01:29:17.218]  They knew that the tree was about to fall on their house in the Middle East, so they decided to put a chain on it, pull it the other direction, and start the cutting in a controlled burn.
[01:29:17.218 --> 01:29:26.625]  In Libya, in Egypt, in all these countries, it's admitted that the State Department, CIA, MI6, Mossad did run it.
[01:29:27.345 --> 01:29:31.888]  And they're putting even worse military dictators in, is what they've now done.
[01:29:31.888 --> 01:29:38.292]  Totally banning protests in Egypt, and the folks are still rebelling, but now Anderson Cooper isn't covering it and hailing it.
[01:29:38.292 --> 01:29:45.777]  So the Bilderberg boys want a wide collapse in the Middle East to drive up oil prices to further bankrupt the general population.
[01:29:45.777 --> 01:29:49.719]  Kurt Nemo's got this key boil-down report coming out soon at Infowars.com.
[01:29:49.719 --> 01:29:51.020]  Gerald, stay there.
[01:29:51.020 --> 01:29:52.421]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.421 --> 01:29:53.922]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.927 --> 01:29:57.669]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:57.669 --> 01:30:04.733]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[01:30:04.733 --> 01:30:05.994]  Tyranny is here.
[01:30:05.994 --> 01:30:09.716]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:30:09.716 --> 01:30:12.178]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:30:12.178 --> 01:30:18.041]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:30:18.041 --> 01:30:24.265]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:30:24.685 --> 01:30:30.668]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:30:30.668 --> 01:30:34.829]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:30:34.829 --> 01:30:39.131]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:30:39.131 --> 01:30:45.073]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:30:45.073 --> 01:30:48.635]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:30:48.635 --> 01:30:50.616]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:30:50.616 --> 01:30:51.036]  It's here.

[01:31:01.501 --> 01:31:03.201]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:31:03.201 --> 01:31:08.504]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:31:08.504 --> 01:31:10.045]  Saving means to make money.
[01:31:10.045 --> 01:31:18.829]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:31:19.569 --> 01:31:27.091]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:31:27.091 --> 01:31:35.093]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:31:35.093 --> 01:31:40.335]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:31:40.335 --> 01:31:42.495]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:31:45.276 --> 01:31:48.479]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[01:31:48.479 --> 01:31:50.861]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:31:50.861 --> 01:31:52.983]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[01:31:59.957 --> 01:32:04.521]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:32:04.521 --> 01:32:05.421]  Number 1.
[01:32:05.421 --> 01:32:08.844]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:08.844 --> 01:32:09.725]  Number 2.
[01:32:09.725 --> 01:32:14.608]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:14.608 --> 01:32:15.349]  It's true.
[01:32:15.349 --> 01:32:20.213]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:20.213 --> 01:32:21.053]  Number 3.
[01:32:21.053 --> 01:32:24.636]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:24.636 --> 01:32:28.339]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:28.539 --> 01:32:29.340]  Number 4.
[01:32:29.340 --> 01:32:32.102]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:32.102 --> 01:32:35.765]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:32:35.765 --> 01:32:36.566]  Number 5.
[01:32:36.566 --> 01:32:40.710]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:32:40.710 --> 01:32:45.474]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:32:45.754 --> 01:32:49.916]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:49.916 --> 01:32:51.717]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:51.717 --> 01:32:53.958]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:32:53.958 --> 01:32:56.319]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:33:33.686 --> 01:33:35.907]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:33:35.907 --> 01:33:36.947]  until 2 p.m.
[01:33:36.947 --> 01:33:38.368]  We are here live.
[01:33:38.368 --> 01:33:40.028]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:33:40.028 --> 01:33:51.372]  We've got the multimedia videocast at PrisonPlanet.tv, intermittent photos and live video feeds at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:33:51.372 --> 01:33:54.653]  Gerald Salente riding shotgun with us for the rest of the hour.
[01:33:54.653 --> 01:33:56.654]  We're going to go back to Gerald here in a moment.
[01:33:56.654 --> 01:33:57.574]  Be sure and check out his
[01:33:58.414 --> 01:34:02.179]  Very informative website TrendsResearch.com.
[01:34:02.179 --> 01:34:04.682]  He's the founder of the Trends Research Institute in 1980.
[01:34:04.682 --> 01:34:09.068]  He's the national best-selling author of Trends 2000 and Trends Tracking.
[01:34:09.068 --> 01:34:12.051]  Trends Research Institute covers 300 diversified trends.
[01:34:12.051 --> 01:34:16.677]  He has a great team including former Wall Street Journal editor Dr. Paul Craig Roberts working with him.
[01:34:17.598 --> 01:34:28.766]  And he's earned the reputation as one of the most trusted names in trends by accurately forecasting hundreds of social, business, consumer, environmental, economic, political, entertainment, and technology trends.
[01:34:28.766 --> 01:34:34.030]  Now, before I go back to him, I'm launching a major initiative.
[01:34:34.030 --> 01:34:37.752]  I am announcing, and we need to get Steve Watson on the horn,
[01:34:39.171 --> 01:34:42.994]  Um, via his cell phone, because he's staying in England, because I got Kurt covered up right now.
[01:34:42.994 --> 01:34:49.898]  And you get Steve Watson on the horn right now to get this out at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:34:49.898 --> 01:34:56.903]  And I got the idea for this looking at Twitter comments and looking at InfoWars comments during the break.
[01:34:56.903 --> 01:34:58.744]  People are saying, where are the Swiss?
[01:34:58.744 --> 01:35:01.886]  They're pro-gun, anti-globalist people.
[01:35:01.886 --> 01:35:06.289]  They play both sides of it, you know, letting the globalists also nest there while they keep them at arm's length.
[01:35:07.538 --> 01:35:07.878]  I don't
[01:35:24.946 --> 01:35:26.827]  That town, St.
[01:35:26.827 --> 01:35:29.970]  Moritz, there in Switzerland.
[01:35:29.970 --> 01:35:42.999]  Let's call for everybody peacefully to be there and call for everyone listening to contact National U.S., British, Swiss, German, Dutch, French, Flemish, all of them.
[01:35:42.999 --> 01:35:47.763]  Call them and tell them, be there, cover this, this is happening.
[01:35:47.763 --> 01:35:51.245]  Let's have a mass viral movement against this.
[01:35:51.245 --> 01:35:52.086]  Get the article.
[01:35:52.566 --> 01:35:54.107]  That's up at InfoWars.com.
[01:35:54.107 --> 01:35:55.568]  It'll be continually updated.
[01:35:55.568 --> 01:35:58.391]  Exclusive live video and photos from Bilderberg.
[01:35:58.391 --> 01:35:59.572]  Continually updated.
[01:35:59.572 --> 01:36:00.272]  Other big article.
[01:36:00.272 --> 01:36:06.697]  Bilderberg's may give green light to Mexican central banker as new IMF boss.
[01:36:06.697 --> 01:36:07.338]  By Kurt Nemo.
[01:36:07.338 --> 01:36:10.180]  And he's got an even bigger report with the inside agenda.
[01:36:10.180 --> 01:36:12.362]  The first section that we just got.
[01:36:12.362 --> 01:36:14.383]  Please!
[01:36:14.383 --> 01:36:15.024]  Now here's the deal.
[01:36:16.345 --> 01:36:17.666]  Here's gonna be the key search term.
[01:36:17.666 --> 01:36:19.327]  It will link through to the article we write.
[01:36:19.327 --> 01:36:22.768]  It will link through to any of your websites that write about this.
[01:36:22.768 --> 01:36:25.290]  I don't care about InfoWars just getting the traffic.
[01:36:25.290 --> 01:36:27.891]  I want the traffic, because the truth is in InfoWars.
[01:36:27.891 --> 01:36:32.033]  The truth lives in InfoWars, as other people are now adopting our nomenclature.
[01:36:32.033 --> 01:36:33.334]  That's fine.
[01:36:33.334 --> 01:36:36.436]  Nothing succeeds like success.
[01:36:36.436 --> 01:36:41.458]  Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery.
[01:36:41.458 --> 01:36:42.919]  Innovation breeds copiers.
[01:36:42.919 --> 01:36:44.100]  Good, that's what I want.
[01:36:45.697 --> 01:36:51.144]  Listen, let's make it the number one search term, Bilderberg protest.
[01:36:51.144 --> 01:36:53.146]  Bilderberg protest.
[01:36:53.146 --> 01:36:55.509]  Two words, Bilderberg protest.
[01:36:55.509 --> 01:37:02.838]  Go to, and by the way, the head of Google every year, and the former head Schmidt is probably there, and the current head of Google, they're always there.
[01:37:04.580 --> 01:37:06.221]  You need to expose them.
[01:37:06.221 --> 01:37:07.642]  Bilderberg.
[01:37:07.642 --> 01:37:10.064]  And if it doesn't show up as number one, you know they're censoring it.
[01:37:10.064 --> 01:37:11.004]  Bilderberg protest.
[01:37:11.004 --> 01:37:11.865]  You go to Google.
[01:37:11.865 --> 01:37:14.507]  You enter it over and over and over again in the search box.
[01:37:14.507 --> 01:37:15.848]  You just enter it.
[01:37:15.848 --> 01:37:16.508]  Hit enter.
[01:37:16.508 --> 01:37:19.911]  Put the cursor back in it so it's a new search.
[01:37:19.911 --> 01:37:20.291]  Enter.
[01:37:20.291 --> 01:37:20.591]  Enter.
[01:37:20.591 --> 01:37:20.891]  Enter.
[01:37:20.891 --> 01:37:21.092]  Enter.
[01:37:21.092 --> 01:37:21.972]  Let's drive it to number one.
[01:37:21.972 --> 01:37:23.714]  Bilderberg protest.
[01:37:23.714 --> 01:37:25.074]  Bilderberg protest.
[01:37:25.074 --> 01:37:25.935]  Hit them.
[01:37:25.935 --> 01:37:26.836]  Hit them hard.
[01:37:28.032 --> 01:37:29.772]  Hit them, hit them hard.
[01:37:29.772 --> 01:37:32.553]  Let's push Bilderberg protests to number one.
[01:37:32.553 --> 01:37:36.674]  I'll get Steve Watson to do an article in the next three hours before this becomes number one.
[01:37:36.674 --> 01:37:53.477]  Search term about Alex Jones is calling on people and press to break the economic news blockade of how these people are robbing us, to break the blockade of how they're setting up the next round of bailouts, which are really robberies to the bankers, and how we're calling on people everywhere to converge peacefully.
[01:37:53.477 --> 01:37:55.437]  We have to add that, how dare us go to the criminals and
[01:37:55.697 --> 01:37:55.897]  Yeah.
[01:38:19.284 --> 01:38:22.467]  I could show up late and miss something I've already confirmed I'll do.
[01:38:22.467 --> 01:38:23.909]  So I'm going to shut up now.
[01:38:23.909 --> 01:38:25.430]  Going back to Gerald Cilente.
[01:38:25.430 --> 01:38:26.751]  Folks, Bilderberg protest.
[01:38:26.751 --> 01:38:28.053]  We're going to get it out.
[01:38:28.053 --> 01:38:29.034]  It's on.
[01:38:29.034 --> 01:38:29.774]  Get it out.
[01:38:29.774 --> 01:38:31.096]  Get our Twitter out.
[01:38:31.096 --> 01:38:34.399]  In fact, calling everyone who loves liberty.
[01:38:34.399 --> 01:38:36.020]  The banksters are coming.
[01:38:36.020 --> 01:38:37.061]  They're in Switzerland.
[01:38:37.962 --> 01:38:39.423]  What is it?
[01:38:39.423 --> 01:38:41.003]  Two-eth by sea, one-eth by land?
[01:38:41.003 --> 01:38:42.984]  Am I getting that right with Paul Revere?
[01:38:42.984 --> 01:38:44.164]  I mean, it's here.
[01:38:44.164 --> 01:38:51.766]  They've come by land, they're setting up the next level of implosion, and then they'll come back and say, give us even more power, and we'll save you.
[01:38:51.766 --> 01:38:52.827]  But it only gets worse.
[01:38:52.827 --> 01:38:55.627]  This is how third world countries became third world countries.
[01:38:55.627 --> 01:38:59.949]  So again, key search term, Bilderberg protest.
[01:38:59.949 --> 01:39:02.029]  Two words, hit them, hit them hard.
[01:39:02.029 --> 01:39:03.670]  Gerald Cilente, what do you think of the idea?
[01:39:04.378 --> 01:39:05.659]  I'm gonna tweet it.
[01:39:05.659 --> 01:39:06.720]  You can count on me.
[01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:08.702]  I'll keep it going.
[01:39:08.702 --> 01:39:09.683]  Anything.
[01:39:09.683 --> 01:39:10.964]  Absolutely.
[01:39:10.964 --> 01:39:16.368]  But again, what the people have to do is they really have to understand that they must stand up.
[01:39:16.368 --> 01:39:21.632]  I just got back from Ireland, and I was a little bit disheartened, I have to say.
[01:39:21.632 --> 01:39:24.315]  Whatever happened to those fighting Irish?
[01:39:24.815 --> 01:39:26.017]  They're rolling over.
[01:39:26.017 --> 01:39:33.287]  The government is now putting water taxes on them, more property taxes to bail out the banks.
[01:39:33.287 --> 01:39:35.330]  And it's very simple.
[01:39:35.330 --> 01:39:40.157]  I said to them, take one letter and change it.
[01:39:40.157 --> 01:39:40.637]  Iceland,
[01:39:42.083 --> 01:39:43.003]  Ireland.
[01:39:43.003 --> 01:39:45.664]  Put that C in Ireland.
[01:39:45.664 --> 01:39:47.484]  Don't pay the banks.
[01:39:47.484 --> 01:39:49.365]  Screw the bankers.
[01:39:49.365 --> 01:39:51.385]  That's all you have to do.
[01:39:51.385 --> 01:39:58.886]  You look at every nation that has shoved it back to the IMF and they're all doing better.
[01:39:58.886 --> 01:40:02.887]  The IMF is nothing more than a crime syndicate.
[01:40:02.887 --> 01:40:06.288]  As I said, it's the International Mafia Federation.
[01:40:06.328 --> 01:40:09.230]  Hey, we got their IMF World Bank documents in 2002.
[01:40:09.230 --> 01:40:11.031]  When Stiklitz left, they got leaked.
[01:40:11.031 --> 01:40:18.234]  BBC, it was how they go in, how they buy off the politicians, how they get the finance ministers in, how they have them buy these investments.
[01:40:18.234 --> 01:40:19.335]  Then they implode it.
[01:40:19.335 --> 01:40:20.536]  Then the economy implodes.
[01:40:20.536 --> 01:40:21.776]  Then riots start.
[01:40:21.776 --> 01:40:23.377]  They call it the IMF riot.
[01:40:23.377 --> 01:40:24.298]  Then that destroys
[01:40:24.798 --> 01:40:26.340]  Credibility even more.
[01:40:26.340 --> 01:40:27.601]  The stocks go down.
[01:40:27.601 --> 01:40:29.683]  They come in and buy them up for pennies on the dollar.
[01:40:29.683 --> 01:40:30.344]  We have them.
[01:40:30.344 --> 01:40:31.865]  They should all be arrested.
[01:40:31.865 --> 01:40:35.349]  And we have good Swiss ministers calling for their arrest.
[01:40:35.349 --> 01:40:39.553]  So the Swiss people, high noon, Saturday, need to be there, Gerald.
[01:40:40.234 --> 01:40:41.334]  Yes.
[01:40:41.334 --> 01:40:48.156]  And going back and tying this all together, Alex, let's not forget just a month ago.
[01:40:48.156 --> 01:40:54.858]  Don't you feel a lot better now that Osama bin Laden, you know, that fairy tale they told us?
[01:40:54.858 --> 01:40:57.579]  Isn't our life just great after that?
[01:40:57.579 --> 01:40:59.460]  That fairy tale happened.
[01:40:59.460 --> 01:41:04.021]  But today, just listen to the chief of NATO, the NATO chief.
[01:41:04.821 --> 01:41:09.489]  We need, quote, wider participation in Libya.
[01:41:09.489 --> 01:41:10.972]  Wider participation?
[01:41:10.972 --> 01:41:13.877]  This is a psychopath talking!
[01:41:13.877 --> 01:41:16.261]  He calls wanton murder...
[01:41:17.424 --> 01:41:19.106]  Wider participation?
[01:41:37.961 --> 01:41:39.782]  The elephant's sitting on us!
[01:41:39.782 --> 01:41:42.484]  The elephant's not in the room, it's sitting on us!
[01:41:42.484 --> 01:41:46.186]  And I want out of the elephant's rear end!
[01:41:46.186 --> 01:41:50.808]  Well listen, that's the point that I'm trying to make, is exactly that.
[01:41:50.808 --> 01:42:02.395]  Because what they're going to do, by the time election day comes, and the economy's in much worse shape than it is now, count on a terrorist strike.
[01:42:03.095 --> 01:42:04.456]  More war.
[01:42:04.456 --> 01:42:09.901]  You saw how effectively that terror bandwagon rolls.
[01:42:09.901 --> 01:42:23.773]  Go back four days, April 27th, before Osama, or Barack Osama Obama, whoever, before he hit the stage and said,
[01:42:25.043 --> 01:42:29.126]  Our core interests and those of our allies are at stake.
[01:42:29.126 --> 01:42:31.167]  So I'm going to war against Libya.
[01:42:31.167 --> 01:42:33.608]  Go back four days before.
[01:42:33.608 --> 01:42:43.455]  Osama bin Bernanke, public enemy number one, gave the first ever press conference of the Federal Reserve.
[01:42:43.455 --> 01:42:51.280]  By the time he finished his dog and pony show, gold prices shot up twenty dollars an ounce.
[01:42:52.200 --> 01:42:53.801]  Silver spiked.
[01:42:53.801 --> 01:42:58.883]  The dollar hit a three-year low against a trade-weighted basket of currency.
[01:42:58.883 --> 01:43:01.584]  Nobody buys what these crooks say anymore.
[01:43:01.584 --> 01:43:04.665]  But what happened four days later?
[01:43:05.802 --> 01:43:14.909]  When Osama was back in the news, hey, we fitted him with these cement shoes, and now he's swimming with the fishes.
[01:43:14.909 --> 01:43:16.990]  I mean, who could believe this story?
[01:43:16.990 --> 01:43:20.213]  Commodity prices dove.
[01:43:20.213 --> 01:43:22.794]  Gold fell from 1570s down to around 1500.
[01:43:26.317 --> 01:43:35.600]  The power of Osama, Barack Osama, Hussein, whatever his name is, whatever his passport says.
[01:43:35.600 --> 01:43:37.781]  It was irrational exuberance.
[01:43:37.781 --> 01:43:39.042]  High five and we won!
[01:43:39.042 --> 01:43:39.882]  Everything's fine!
[01:43:39.882 --> 01:43:47.405]  Meanwhile, the bankers are just stealing everything, setting up mafia deals where, oh, you don't have to get insurance if you're an Obama insider.
[01:43:47.405 --> 01:43:48.165]  Your company doesn't.
[01:43:48.165 --> 01:43:48.965]  Oh, you're GE.
[01:43:48.965 --> 01:43:50.246]  You can build more power plants.
[01:43:50.246 --> 01:43:50.926]  You get a waiver.
[01:43:51.246 --> 01:43:56.570]  I mean, everything they do is total mafia, right out of the classic book.
[01:43:56.570 --> 01:44:02.774]  But, oh, we were taught, like you said, that archetype, only Italians are involved in organized crime.
[01:44:02.774 --> 01:44:04.335]  Not the Blank Fines.
[01:44:04.335 --> 01:44:05.696]  Not the Bushes.
[01:44:05.696 --> 01:44:08.078]  No, not the Dominique Strauss-Kahns.
[01:44:08.078 --> 01:44:10.980]  Only, only those Italians.
[01:44:10.980 --> 01:44:12.360]  No anybody else.
[01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:19.846]  Anybody who's old, with a bald head and a suit, you gotta fall down, open your wrist up to them, give them all your money, give them your whole future.
[01:44:20.626 --> 01:44:34.411]  They now admit the average household owes, I saw a number like 527,000, here's USA Today, per household just on one part of unfunded future promises.
[01:44:34.411 --> 01:44:38.432]  So it isn't 14 something trillion, it's in the hundreds and hundreds of trillions.
[01:44:38.432 --> 01:44:43.894]  We could have already paid all this off, but they have signed us on to the Fiat Ponzi scheme.
[01:44:44.614 --> 01:44:45.595]  I'm sorry, Gerald.
[01:45:11.428 --> 01:45:30.692]  Well that's it, and that's very important because what I'm saying is, by the time the elections come in 2012, the people are going to be cheering on, whether it's a false flag, which most likely, or something real because the United States keeps starting wars all over the world.
[01:45:31.332 --> 01:45:33.734]  The mind won't be on the economy.
[01:45:33.734 --> 01:45:35.575]  They're gonna do a Bush.
[01:45:35.575 --> 01:45:37.817]  And I can see it happening.
[01:45:37.817 --> 01:45:41.279]  The first great war of the 21st century has begun.
[01:45:41.279 --> 01:45:43.421]  Look what's not making the news.
[01:45:43.421 --> 01:45:45.062]  Albania.
[01:45:45.062 --> 01:45:47.183]  They're starting war over there again.
[01:45:47.183 --> 01:45:50.005]  The people are fed up with the criminal system.
[01:45:50.005 --> 01:45:55.509]  You're gonna see it in Romania, Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary.
[01:45:55.509 --> 01:45:58.772]  The spring, the Arab spring that they call,
[01:45:59.332 --> 01:46:06.598]  Now we're going to see a European summer and get ready for a world winter.
[01:46:06.598 --> 01:46:08.319]  They're leading us to war.
[01:46:08.319 --> 01:46:10.601]  They're going to divert our attention.
[01:46:10.601 --> 01:46:14.905]  Listen to Bernie Madoff, the King of Ponzi.
[01:46:14.905 --> 01:46:19.429]  He did an interview in New York Magazine over the telephone.
[01:46:19.429 --> 01:46:21.270]  And he said two things.
[01:46:21.270 --> 01:46:22.971]  He said, when I got into Wall Street,
[01:46:23.812 --> 01:46:28.575]  I realize you had to be a member of the club and the game is rigged.
[01:46:28.575 --> 01:46:35.260]  Number two, he said it's nothing more than one big Ponzi scheme.
[01:46:35.260 --> 01:46:38.743]  This is coming from the King of Ponzi.
[01:46:38.743 --> 01:46:40.664]  It's a Ponzi scheme.
[01:46:40.664 --> 01:46:47.789]  They're suckering in the people by shoving that money out there to keep the scam going.
[01:46:47.789 --> 01:46:51.712]  It's going to collapse, but our minds will be off it.
[01:46:52.677 --> 01:47:14.299]  Alex, the timeline, the crash of 29, the Great Depression, currency wars, trade wars, the panic of 08, the Great Recession, which is a depression, currency wars, trade wars, World War II in the 30s, the first great war of the 21st century in 2012 and beyond.
[01:47:18.604 --> 01:47:22.466]  It's incredible, and now they're announcing, and they said they'd do this years ago.
[01:47:22.466 --> 01:47:24.908]  I've laid it all out for listeners, explained it.
[01:47:24.908 --> 01:47:28.170]  First, they take the belt off, take the shoes off, take the jacket off.
[01:47:28.170 --> 01:47:30.151]  Now we're going to touch the outside of your pants.
[01:47:30.151 --> 01:47:31.312]  Now we're going to touch the inside.
[01:47:31.312 --> 01:47:32.713]  Now you've got to go in the scanner.
[01:47:32.713 --> 01:47:33.273]  Well, don't worry.
[01:47:33.273 --> 01:47:34.674]  You don't have to put your hands up now.
[01:47:34.674 --> 01:47:37.515]  And they've announced it, and they've released photos of it.
[01:47:37.515 --> 01:47:41.458]  You have trusted traveler, normal, and untrusted.
[01:47:41.458 --> 01:47:44.860]  And it's a whole new judicial system where there's no judge, no jury.
[01:47:44.860 --> 01:47:46.501]  You're just put on the no-fly list.
[01:47:46.501 --> 01:47:47.782]  Two million Americans now on it.
[01:47:48.622 --> 01:47:49.023]  I don't know.
[01:48:07.623 --> 01:48:24.996]  You just go through a body scan but if you're a good little slave you walk through and retina scan your retina if you've enrolled and gotten permission from them to just have to retina scan but they said sometimes we're still gonna grope you anyway so it's like oh we got and and the headlines are
[01:48:25.576 --> 01:48:28.319]  Uh, how they've got all these wonderful new systems.
[01:48:28.319 --> 01:48:31.842]  Former TSA officer sentenced to 30 months for taking bribes.
[01:48:31.842 --> 01:48:33.964]  Sorry, that's a new article out of New Jersey today.
[01:48:33.964 --> 01:48:34.684]  Here's one.
[01:48:34.684 --> 01:48:37.307]  Coming to an airport near you, iris scans.
[01:48:37.307 --> 01:48:37.807]  Here's another one.
[01:48:37.807 --> 01:48:40.249]  Airlines aim to take hassle out of security.
[01:48:41.070 --> 01:48:41.710]  Checks.
[01:48:41.710 --> 01:48:44.812]  See, they always act like, oh, it's the new thing to make it better.
[01:48:44.812 --> 01:48:50.316]  Just like Obama said, don't worry, you can ride on the new national train system in the State of the Union that they'll never build.
[01:48:50.316 --> 01:48:53.178]  And there won't be checkpoints there or body scanners.
[01:48:53.178 --> 01:48:57.360]  He knew full well for seven years they've been doing drills and spot checks.
[01:48:57.360 --> 01:49:01.002]  Now they're rolling out nationwide, even at high school proms.
[01:49:01.002 --> 01:49:06.846]  It's the total national security force training you that they have mobile vans, checkpoints.
[01:49:06.846 --> 01:49:08.067]  They're going to search everybody.
[01:49:08.687 --> 01:49:12.330]  They're getting us ready for martial law, Gerald, under another name.
[01:49:12.330 --> 01:49:14.691]  And notice, they're now announcing all of this.
[01:49:14.691 --> 01:49:24.198]  Oh, and Al-Qaeda is supposedly led by Adam Perlman, aka Gadahn, who's Jewish, and his granddaddy ran the ADL, but whatever.
[01:49:24.198 --> 01:49:26.340]  Okay, Al-Qaeda follows the ADL guy.
[01:49:27.801 --> 01:49:32.745]  And he says, oh, those gun shows, it's so wonderful, we can get guns and kill Americans.
[01:49:32.745 --> 01:49:37.409]  The media's like, we gotta ban the gun shows and ban semi-auto now because of Al Qaeda.
[01:49:37.409 --> 01:49:38.710]  I mean, it's so clear.
[01:49:38.710 --> 01:49:41.893]  They make it up, they use it, it's all theater, Gerald.
[01:49:42.967 --> 01:49:45.669]  Alex, you talked about martial law.
[01:49:45.669 --> 01:49:51.692]  I'm urging everyone to consider economic martial law because that's what's going to happen next.
[01:49:51.692 --> 01:49:58.856]  Just as 9-11 happened, whether or not it was real or whatever, the fact is two buildings came down and the Pentagon was whacked.
[01:49:58.856 --> 01:50:00.877]  How it happened, forget it.
[01:50:00.877 --> 01:50:03.559]  The issue is they closed Wall Street.
[01:50:03.559 --> 01:50:06.300]  If you had certificates of deposit, you couldn't cash them in.
[01:50:06.300 --> 01:50:08.481]  I know because I tried.
[01:50:08.481 --> 01:50:10.783]  What I'm doing, and only speaking for myself,
[01:50:12.262 --> 01:50:23.614]  I urge those that can think for themselves to consider making sure you don't have a lot of money in the bank, because you ain't gonna get it out.
[01:50:23.614 --> 01:50:31.622]  And if you have your gold stored there or somewhere else in one of those federal institutions, kiss it goodbye.
[01:50:31.622 --> 01:50:33.904]  And if they do let you get your money out,
[01:50:34.665 --> 01:50:36.606]  That dollar won't be worth a dime.
[01:50:36.606 --> 01:50:38.527]  It's hardly worth a dime now.
[01:50:38.527 --> 01:50:41.229]  Look what it's doing against the basket of currencies.
[01:50:41.229 --> 01:50:43.470]  Because they're going to devalue it.
[01:50:43.470 --> 01:50:46.411]  And don't worry, you won't be able to get it out at all.
[01:50:46.411 --> 01:50:47.312]  Gerald, stay there.
[01:50:47.312 --> 01:50:48.092]  Stay there.
[01:50:48.092 --> 01:50:49.833]  This is key information.
[01:50:49.833 --> 01:50:50.694]  You're absolutely right.
[01:50:50.694 --> 01:50:51.614]  They're gearing up for it.
[01:50:51.614 --> 01:50:54.336]  They've changed the banking rules to be able to do it.
[01:50:54.336 --> 01:50:58.818]  They're now kicking down doors with federal SWAT teams over unpaid college dues.
[01:50:58.818 --> 01:50:59.358]  It's on.
[01:50:59.358 --> 01:51:00.399]  Economic Martial Law.
[01:51:01.199 --> 01:51:03.282]  What would you do with a check for $25,000?
[01:51:03.282 --> 01:51:08.608]  What if you could eliminate all of your credit card debt in 90 days and keep all of your money?
[01:51:08.608 --> 01:51:18.879]  Hi, I'm Jason Davenport, and I've just completed ZeroDebt100.com, a program that stops and prevents debt collections of all kinds, including debt collectors and foreclosures, with guaranteed results.
[01:51:19.099 --> 01:51:20.419]  Forget loan modification.
[01:51:20.419 --> 01:51:26.781]  Zero Debt showed me how to get the banks to pay my property taxes and insurance while stopping my foreclosure without paying one dime.
[01:51:26.781 --> 01:51:32.223]  An attorney tried to garnish my wages but the court denied his request because of what I filed from the Zero Debt program.
[01:51:32.223 --> 01:51:36.524]  Find out how I did this by calling Zero Debt today at 800-477-9256.
[01:51:36.524 --> 01:51:44.926]  Tell them Jason sent you and ask for the Zero Debt special and the free bonus promotion about stopping an IRS levy and getting your money back.
[01:51:45.086 --> 01:51:46.647]  Tell them Jason sent you and call 800-477-9256.
[01:51:46.647 --> 01:51:46.747]  800-477-9256.
[01:51:46.747 --> 01:51:46.987]  That's 800-477-9256.

[01:52:01.989 --> 01:52:06.013]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:52:06.013 --> 01:52:09.257]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:52:09.257 --> 01:52:14.062]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:52:14.062 --> 01:52:20.448]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:52:20.448 --> 01:52:22.691]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:52:23.211 --> 01:52:23.511]  Tim Geithner?
[01:52:23.511 --> 01:52:23.771]  Bernanke?
[01:52:23.771 --> 01:52:24.351]  They're arsonists!
[01:52:24.351 --> 01:52:25.152]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:52:25.152 --> 01:52:27.472]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:52:42.116 --> 01:52:46.502]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[01:52:46.502 --> 01:52:49.386]  we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:52:49.386 --> 01:52:58.518]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv

[01:54:21.749 --> 01:54:23.791]  All right, Gerald Cilente's final segment.
[01:54:23.791 --> 01:54:24.632]  I've been ranting.
[01:54:24.632 --> 01:54:25.613]  He's got so much for us.
[01:54:25.613 --> 01:54:26.695]  I didn't even ask him during the break.
[01:54:26.695 --> 01:54:28.557]  He's probably got to go here at the one-minute break.
[01:54:28.557 --> 01:54:31.921]  If he wants to go five minutes in the next hour, he can.
[01:54:31.921 --> 01:54:33.302]  So much happening, Gerald.
[01:54:33.302 --> 01:54:37.968]  What else is on your radar screen that we haven't talked about or discussed today?
[01:54:38.663 --> 01:54:44.849]  I'd like to pick up what you were talking about with the TSA and groping, and how people just submit.
[01:54:44.849 --> 01:54:49.654]  I just flew out of Newark and I wouldn't go through the x-ray machine, so I opted out.
[01:54:49.654 --> 01:54:55.059]  But as I'm waiting online, I'm watching the sheeple go through, and I was thinking to myself,
[01:54:55.720 --> 01:55:05.389]  They could have the freight train on the other side of the door, and they would just get in and take them off to the FEMA camps, and they wouldn't say a peep.
[01:55:05.389 --> 01:55:10.994]  And I have to say how discouraged I am at the lack of courage that people have.
[01:55:10.994 --> 01:55:14.217]  And then, you know, going through the whole routine, I mean, I mean...
[01:55:14.637 --> 01:55:17.679]  Come on, you know, let's stop with this terrorist stuff.
[01:55:17.679 --> 01:55:20.560]  Yeah, I look like the kind of guy that's going to blow the plane up.
[01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:25.723]  And if I wanted to blow something up, I mean, do I have to get on a plane to do it?
[01:55:25.723 --> 01:55:28.044]  You know, so this is all a scam.
[01:55:28.044 --> 01:55:34.028]  But I have to tell you how discouraged I am to see the people so willfully submit.
[01:55:34.688 --> 01:55:45.831]  And they're going to continue to willfully submit, just as they did, as they all applauded, Osama Obama, Barack Hussein, whatever his name is.
[01:55:45.831 --> 01:55:50.533]  And by the way, whenever terrorist Al-Syeda blows up a World Trade Center or something like that,
[01:55:51.153 --> 01:55:51.913]  I've gone out at night.
[01:55:51.913 --> 01:55:53.734]  People are buying steaks, beer.
[01:55:53.734 --> 01:55:58.236]  It's fun to watch the people dying and to feel hurt and get upset.
[01:55:58.236 --> 01:56:01.277]  That's how decadent a large portion of the population is.
[01:56:01.277 --> 01:56:02.458]  They didn't get scared.
[01:56:02.458 --> 01:56:05.099]  They got excited like it was a spectacle.
[01:56:05.099 --> 01:56:06.960]  And then it's fun to give your rights up.
[01:56:06.960 --> 01:56:09.241]  And, oh, then the government anthrax gets mailed.
[01:56:09.241 --> 01:56:11.382]  And it's fun to get scared of that.
[01:56:11.382 --> 01:56:13.663]  But that's a group that's going to suck their thumbs.
[01:56:14.423 --> 01:56:21.093]  There's a growing group, a minority, but it's approaching a majority, that is not going to be slaves, and that's what the globalists need to understand.
[01:56:21.093 --> 01:56:26.220]  They're not going to be able to beat us, and we're identifying them, and we're not going into this long night.
[01:56:26.220 --> 01:56:28.964]  We are going to stop their world government takeover.
[01:56:29.878 --> 01:56:30.639]  That's right.
[01:56:30.639 --> 01:56:35.324]  And you know, I remember being on your show recently when Fukushima broke out.
[01:56:35.324 --> 01:56:40.749]  And you and I were adamant about it, that you were showing the footage of this thing blowing up.
[01:56:40.749 --> 01:56:43.271]  And we're saying, no, this is a meltdown.
[01:56:43.271 --> 01:56:45.314]  And how they lied!
[01:56:45.914 --> 01:56:50.177]  How they lied and they keep lying.
[01:56:50.177 --> 01:56:52.739]  And the people, it's out of the news.
[01:56:52.739 --> 01:56:53.499]  Nobody's talking about it.
[01:56:53.499 --> 01:56:58.082]  No, they said it was a conspiracy theory that people were saying that they'd had meltdown.
[01:56:58.082 --> 01:57:08.609]  Now they admit three total meltdowns, including a plutonium reactor blowing rods 3,000 feet in the sky, at least 10 times worse now total.
[01:57:08.609 --> 01:57:15.314]  And we had scientists on who had the meters and said isotopes are being released that are only released in beyond meltdown.
[01:57:16.154 --> 01:57:21.919]  Actual mini-nuclear explosions, Gerald, and it's incredible!
[01:57:21.919 --> 01:57:23.760]  They knew the whole time!
[01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:29.004]  They knew the whole time, and they're lying to us every day, every minute.
[01:57:29.004 --> 01:57:31.166]  And I listen to these Republicans.
[01:57:31.166 --> 01:57:32.727]  You know, I'm a political atheist.
[01:57:32.727 --> 01:57:35.929]  I don't believe in either of these mafia parties.
[01:57:35.929 --> 01:57:40.713]  And I'm listening to them now about, you know, we have to cut back on the budget.
[01:57:41.033 --> 01:57:44.595]  Not one peep about cutting the defense budget.
[01:57:44.595 --> 01:57:46.437]  And what are they talking about?
[01:57:46.437 --> 01:57:50.399]  We have to keep our guns aimed in Afghanistan.
[01:57:50.399 --> 01:57:51.980]  And what are they going to do?
[01:57:51.980 --> 01:57:57.083]  They're going to bring in soldiers of the Fortune 500 into Iraq.
[01:57:57.083 --> 01:58:01.586]  They're pulling out the soldiers and then putting in the defense contractors.
[01:58:01.586 --> 01:58:03.147]  Defense contractors.
[01:58:03.147 --> 01:58:04.068]  Mercenaries.
[01:58:04.676 --> 01:58:20.060]  And another thing, Alex, another trend that everybody should pay a lot of attention to, and it ties in with so many of your advertisers, and if you're going to make money and stay alive and stay healthy, look at this E. coli outbreak.
[01:58:20.060 --> 01:58:22.420]  Look how they're pushing that out of the news.
[01:58:22.420 --> 01:58:23.800]  Stay there, stay there.
[01:58:23.800 --> 01:58:25.601]  Can you do five more minutes and finish up with that?
[01:58:26.261 --> 01:58:26.801]  I can.
[01:58:26.801 --> 01:58:27.582]  Okay, good, good.
[01:58:27.582 --> 01:58:29.062]  Gerald Cilente is our guest.
[01:58:29.062 --> 01:58:34.084]  Coming up a little bit later in the hour, live from Bilderberg, continual coverage at Infowars.com.
[01:58:34.084 --> 01:58:42.367]  Don't forget the Google key search term, protest Bilderberg, or Bilderberg protest, Bilderberg protest.

[01:59:53.729 --> 01:59:56.113]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.113 --> 01:59:58.876]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.475 --> 02:00:10.302]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.302 --> 02:00:11.904]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.904 --> 02:00:13.446]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.446 --> 02:00:17.632]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.632 --> 02:00:21.697]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:34.643 --> 02:00:37.065]  By the way, I've done two hours of transmission.
[02:00:37.065 --> 02:00:42.049]  I haven't even plugged the videos, the books, the t-shirts, the online video bookstore at Infowars.com.
[02:00:42.049 --> 02:00:43.711]  That's how we fund ourselves.
[02:00:43.711 --> 02:00:47.714]  So if you believe in this Bilderberg Group reportage, please support us.
[02:00:47.714 --> 02:00:50.197]  I'll tell you who paid for most of the trip, which is very expensive.
[02:00:50.957 --> 02:00:53.619]  Uh, and the equipment, a lot of it is Ted Anderson, Midas Resources.
[02:00:53.619 --> 02:01:03.466]  I'm going to be plugging that later, but he's got some great deals on gold and silver, so please think about Ted Anderson and Midas Resources, 800-686-237 when you're making your gold and silver purchases.
[02:01:03.466 --> 02:01:04.607]  Got some really exciting news.
[02:01:04.607 --> 02:01:14.594]  Gerald, even on national news, usually only does 30 minutes, but he's going to stay with us 20 minutes into this hour to take a few of your questions on trends, specifically only for Gerald Solente, folks.
[02:01:14.594 --> 02:01:14.654]  1-800-259-0237.
[02:01:17.856 --> 02:01:21.457]  Ninety-two thirty-one, one eight hundred, two five nine.
[02:01:21.457 --> 02:01:31.641]  Ninety-two thirty-one for specific questions for Gerald Cilente coming up in the next segment and later in the hour, live video reports from Switzerland at Bilderberg with Aaron Dykes and Paul Watson.
[02:01:31.641 --> 02:01:33.602]  Gerald, you were getting into the E. coli
[02:01:34.142 --> 02:01:47.478]  And how they keep blaming this organic food, that organic food, and moving down the line when it's clearly genetically engineered and they're going to use this to try to have government clamp down further on farms and ranches to help Big Agra.
[02:01:47.478 --> 02:01:48.139]  Gerald Cilente.
[02:01:48.609 --> 02:01:50.090]  Well, that's it.
[02:01:50.090 --> 02:01:51.291]  They control everything.
[02:01:51.291 --> 02:01:54.333]  Look at that Senate Bill 501 that they shoved through.
[02:01:54.333 --> 02:02:04.440]  So what we're telling people is that when you really put all the pieces together, the air, the food, the water, you know, they're killing us in a hundred different ways.
[02:02:04.440 --> 02:02:10.484]  You know, by the way, I don't know if you know this, Alex, I have an honorary doctorate from the National University of Health Sciences.
[02:02:11.084 --> 02:02:16.227]  Health Sciences for the work I've done over the many years in complementary medicine.
[02:02:16.227 --> 02:02:21.091]  And the first book I worked on back in the 1980s was called Natural Healing.
[02:02:21.091 --> 02:02:27.235]  So, in this summer that's coming ahead, this is the time to really, really get in shape.
[02:02:27.235 --> 02:02:29.956]  Physically, emotionally, and spiritually.
[02:02:29.956 --> 02:02:33.579]  The products that you sell, the heirloom seeds,
[02:02:34.159 --> 02:02:36.941]  Having your e-foods on hand.
[02:02:36.941 --> 02:02:38.581]  This is real.
[02:02:38.581 --> 02:02:40.963]  The radiation's in the air.
[02:02:40.963 --> 02:02:44.044]  The food system is being poisoned.
[02:02:44.044 --> 02:02:46.106]  We don't have a shot.
[02:02:46.106 --> 02:02:50.288]  And the only shot we do have is if we take it in our own hands.
[02:02:50.828 --> 02:03:00.898]  And I want to talk also about Umidas Resources and the importance for me in owning gold and silver.
[02:03:00.898 --> 02:03:03.920]  Current events form future trends.
[02:03:03.920 --> 02:03:06.303]  Look at these solar flares.
[02:03:06.303 --> 02:03:10.887]  This isn't, you know, this isn't conspiracy theorist stuff.
[02:03:10.887 --> 02:03:13.269]  This is NASA talking about it.
[02:03:13.269 --> 02:03:15.812]  And there's going to be a lot more of them coming this year.
[02:03:16.632 --> 02:03:22.074]  Will you go back to the 1800s when they had Telegraph and the Carrington event?
[02:03:22.074 --> 02:03:23.214]  Fry them!
[02:03:23.214 --> 02:03:24.675]  They were out.
[02:03:24.675 --> 02:03:27.276]  Just think what they're going to do to the internet.
[02:03:27.276 --> 02:03:32.577]  And let's all understand there's no money out there.
[02:03:32.577 --> 02:03:34.158]  It's all digital money.
[02:03:34.778 --> 02:03:37.642]  But it won't fry gold.
[02:03:37.642 --> 02:03:43.089]  It won't fry silver as it fries the electronic system.
[02:03:43.089 --> 02:03:51.361]  And I see this guy from another planet, this Steve Jobs, talking about the wonders of cloud computing.
[02:03:52.355 --> 02:03:54.198]  What cloud computing?
[02:03:54.198 --> 02:03:56.040]  There's no clouds out there.
[02:03:56.040 --> 02:04:01.027]  You're just putting your information on somebody else's server.
[02:04:01.027 --> 02:04:09.718]  And if this happens the way a lot of scientists are saying, you're gonna see a big meltdown, a big frying system
[02:04:09.798 --> 02:04:13.680]  Well, they're engineering it, admittedly, where the devices won't allow you.
[02:04:13.680 --> 02:04:19.983]  At first, you just have certain stuff on the cloud, but they admit, and I talked about this a decade ago, and that's what Internet2 is.
[02:04:19.983 --> 02:04:24.164]  You've got a domain on a bigger domain and have no rights, like YouTube.
[02:04:24.164 --> 02:04:30.947]  You've got your stuff on somebody else's system and you sign your rights away to agree and you're like, well, I'll just keep my stuff on my server.
[02:04:30.947 --> 02:04:38.611]  The devices, and they're getting together at Bilderberg, that's why they get these guys together, they're getting together to make it where the devices soon won't work
[02:04:39.051 --> 02:04:40.832]  With your own computer, your own servers.
[02:04:40.832 --> 02:04:43.213]  You'll have to be in their cloud, Gerald.
[02:04:43.213 --> 02:04:44.533]  I'm glad you brought that up.
[02:04:44.533 --> 02:04:46.094]  More key trends straight ahead.
[02:04:46.094 --> 02:04:50.435]  Your phone calls 800-259-9231.
[02:04:50.435 --> 02:04:54.097]  By the way, well, we got some breaking stuff for you.
[02:04:54.097 --> 02:04:55.617]  I'll cover it when we get back.
[02:04:55.617 --> 02:04:56.557]  This is so amazing.
[02:04:56.557 --> 02:04:56.998]  Stay with us.
[02:05:02.728 --> 02:05:06.691]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:06.691 --> 02:05:15.558]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:05:15.558 --> 02:05:20.181]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:05:20.181 --> 02:05:31.010]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:05:31.630 --> 02:05:41.133]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:41.133 --> 02:05:46.575]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:05:46.575 --> 02:05:54.058]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:54.058 --> 02:05:56.799]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[02:06:01.972 --> 02:06:05.994]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:06:05.994 --> 02:06:09.235]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:06:09.235 --> 02:06:14.037]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:06:14.037 --> 02:06:20.419]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:06:20.419 --> 02:06:22.660]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:06:23.180 --> 02:06:23.500]  Tim Geithner?
[02:06:23.500 --> 02:06:23.781]  Bernanke?
[02:06:23.781 --> 02:06:24.201]  They're arsonists!
[02:06:24.201 --> 02:06:25.142]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:06:25.142 --> 02:06:27.484]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:06:42.116 --> 02:06:43.958]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:06:43.958 --> 02:06:49.385]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:06:49.385 --> 02:06:58.516]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:07:00.518 --> 02:07:05.079]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:07:05.079 --> 02:07:05.999]  Number one.
[02:07:05.999 --> 02:07:09.420]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:07:09.420 --> 02:07:10.280]  Number two.
[02:07:10.280 --> 02:07:15.162]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:07:15.162 --> 02:07:15.902]  It's true.
[02:07:15.902 --> 02:07:20.783]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:07:20.783 --> 02:07:21.603]  Number three.
[02:07:21.603 --> 02:07:25.184]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:07:25.184 --> 02:07:28.885]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:07:29.105 --> 02:07:29.906]  Number 4.
[02:07:29.906 --> 02:07:32.668]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:07:32.668 --> 02:07:36.330]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:07:36.330 --> 02:07:37.131]  Number 5.
[02:07:37.131 --> 02:07:41.274]  A solar-powered generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:07:41.274 --> 02:07:46.037]  Folks, I really believe in the solar-powered generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:07:46.317 --> 02:07:50.498]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:50.498 --> 02:07:52.279]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:52.279 --> 02:07:54.520]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:07:54.520 --> 02:07:57.341]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:07:57.341 --> 02:08:06.304]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:06.304 --> 02:08:08.645]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:08.645 --> 02:08:12.146]  Last November,
[02:08:13.522 --> 02:08:15.483]  Food Safety Modernization Act.
[02:08:15.483 --> 02:08:25.310]  That means radiating it, spraying live viruses on it that eat the E. coli bacteria, but cause mutations.
[02:08:25.310 --> 02:08:26.531]  Narrowly was defeated.
[02:08:27.878 --> 02:08:33.640]  But it passed the Senate, got defeated in the House, started in the House, went to the Senate, and they never got it done between the conference committee.
[02:08:33.640 --> 02:08:42.103]  They have reintroduced it, and you knew this was coming, and Europe's doing the same thing, because of the E. coli, 20 or so deaths, and the hundreds that are sick in Europe.
[02:08:42.103 --> 02:08:47.125]  And it's in the European press that scientists are saying, this is a genes added, this didn't naturally mutate.
[02:08:47.725 --> 02:08:51.127]  And British intelligence says Al-Qaeda did it!
[02:08:51.127 --> 02:08:52.567]  Al-Qaeda did it!
[02:08:52.567 --> 02:09:05.513]  And don't worry, we told you last week and this week it was coming, they've introduced these bills and in the Food Safety Act last year, I haven't had a chance to read the new version yet because when Gerald said that I had a feeling and searched Food Safety Act and boom!
[02:09:05.513 --> 02:09:06.453]  Reintroduced today!
[02:09:06.453 --> 02:09:14.337]  I haven't had time to read the text yet and last time it said adopt the UN's Treaty Codex Alimentarius.
[02:09:15.527 --> 02:09:17.209]  A treaty in there!
[02:09:17.209 --> 02:09:28.342]  Under you in law, you saw the headlines, Daily Mail and others last month, BBC, hundreds of vitamins and minerals and herbal remedies pulled from shelves in England and Europe under EU rules.
[02:09:30.219 --> 02:09:31.300]  Never thought it would happen.
[02:09:31.300 --> 02:09:32.181]  It's happening.
[02:09:32.181 --> 02:09:34.925]  And they put it in this bill.
[02:09:34.925 --> 02:09:44.997]  And when it wouldn't pass that week, $17 million was given by five mega agribusinesses to the House and Senate.
[02:09:44.997 --> 02:09:49.202]  The biggest spending for agriculture legislation in a week on record.
[02:09:50.327 --> 02:09:53.529]  And in there, it shuts down your local farm and ranch.
[02:09:53.529 --> 02:09:57.372]  You can't even can strawberries and give them to your neighbor.
[02:09:57.372 --> 02:09:59.314]  You can't even serve it to your neighbor at dinner.
[02:09:59.314 --> 02:10:03.977]  SWAT team, you see them SWAT teaming Amish without even having the laws, attacking health food stores.
[02:10:03.977 --> 02:10:13.925]  Folks, they're now sending federal goons kicking down doors with local police under their command without warrants for unpaid tuition.
[02:10:15.126 --> 02:10:15.927]  Student loans.
[02:10:15.927 --> 02:10:17.528]  I mean, that's illegal.
[02:10:17.528 --> 02:10:18.830]  I've studied it.
[02:10:18.830 --> 02:10:22.933]  We don't have debtor prisoners, debt prisons here, like England had.
[02:10:22.933 --> 02:10:23.634]  They got rid of it.
[02:10:23.634 --> 02:10:25.836]  There was riots and wars over this.
[02:10:25.836 --> 02:10:27.257]  It's all coming back.
[02:10:27.257 --> 02:10:32.623]  I mean, how does Bank of America take a house they never even owned or have the deed to and it was paid for in cash?
[02:10:32.623 --> 02:10:33.884]  They were never connected.
[02:10:33.884 --> 02:10:34.724]  They just do it!
[02:10:35.365 --> 02:10:44.152]  I know I'm ranting, I want to go to your calls for Gerald Cilente, but Senator Kristen Gillibrand announces food safety legislation and they go on to say they're basically introducing the same thing and
[02:10:46.633 --> 02:10:56.758]  The British government admitted in 2000 that they, it was weaponized foot and mouth that was taken out of a level four weapons lab, they said by an animal rights activist, maybe.
[02:10:56.758 --> 02:10:59.739]  And it showed up in dozens of spots in one day.
[02:10:59.739 --> 02:11:03.921]  No, the government distributed it and then used it to try to shut down the farms over there.
[02:11:03.921 --> 02:11:05.782]  Mystery diseases are killing people's sheep.
[02:11:05.782 --> 02:11:07.743]  I was getting calls when I was on European radio.
[02:11:07.743 --> 02:11:12.666]  Gerald, I'm ranting, it's just you brought this up and it opens up a whole nother paradigm.
[02:11:12.666 --> 02:11:14.467]  They are so lawless
[02:11:15.447 --> 02:11:25.573]  Because in the Food Safety Act, Big Agra is exempt, and they're the ones that are responsible in every major case for the E. coli deaths in Salmonella, but then they come in and want to shut us down.
[02:11:25.573 --> 02:11:28.815]  I mean, it's total slavery, Gerald!
[02:11:28.815 --> 02:11:33.338]  It is, and when you talk about student debts, they're student serfs.
[02:11:33.338 --> 02:11:35.179]  You don't get out of that debt.
[02:11:35.179 --> 02:11:41.943]  Thanks to Joe Biden, when he was senator of the loophole state down there in Delaware,
[02:11:42.563 --> 02:11:44.504]  They push that through.
[02:11:44.504 --> 02:11:47.826]  You're an indentured servant for the rest of your life!
[02:11:47.826 --> 02:11:49.146]  Get it in your head!
[02:11:49.146 --> 02:11:53.088]  You take out those student loans, they own you!
[02:11:53.088 --> 02:11:56.130]  It's student owned, not loaned.
[02:11:56.130 --> 02:12:01.953]  You're only being, you're borrowing for the rest of your life to pay them off.
[02:12:01.953 --> 02:12:11.198]  And then when you talk about what they're scaring us now with food, if it's food, terror, war, it's a very simple formula, Alex.
[02:12:11.798 --> 02:12:14.040]  And it's as old as the hills.
[02:12:14.040 --> 02:12:17.364]  They get you with fear and hysteria.
[02:12:17.364 --> 02:12:22.529]  Those are the tools of the politicians and the religious fanatics.
[02:12:22.529 --> 02:12:24.531]  They're in the same club.
[02:12:24.531 --> 02:12:30.297]  And just to mention, the only way that fear and hysteria
[02:12:32.751 --> 02:12:35.652]  Quashed is by beauty.
[02:12:35.652 --> 02:12:39.174]  Beauty of the mind, the spirit, the heart, and the soul.
[02:12:39.174 --> 02:12:43.696]  Beauty is the antidote to fear, and people shouldn't forget that.
[02:12:43.696 --> 02:12:53.060]  Because if you do, you're going to be engulfed by their hysteria and fear, and get on that cattle car, there's a place at a FEMA camp waiting for you.
[02:12:54.045 --> 02:13:00.189]  And by the way, we said many years ago they would roll the FEMA camps out as places to help people that couldn't pay their bills.
[02:13:00.189 --> 02:13:03.190]  That's how Germany started it in 34, 35.
[02:13:03.190 --> 02:13:04.271]  First, you're in a ghetto.
[02:13:04.271 --> 02:13:06.052]  You can't run your businesses.
[02:13:06.052 --> 02:13:10.855]  Once you run out of money, we don't let you leave the area because we're not authorizing your papers.
[02:13:10.855 --> 02:13:12.456]  Then, oh, you're poor.
[02:13:12.456 --> 02:13:17.259]  We're going to load you up and take you to a work camp where you can pay to take care of yourself.
[02:13:17.259 --> 02:13:20.961]  They're now in California and Hawaii locking the homeless up.
[02:13:21.661 --> 02:13:23.684]  People are like, well good, well it's you next.
[02:13:23.684 --> 02:13:25.846]  And, oh, talking about making them work!
[02:13:26.821 --> 02:13:30.863]  So, it's on, and everything we've seen is now being repeated.
[02:13:30.863 --> 02:13:36.346]  I wanna go to loaded phone lines here before we get to as many as we can, Gerald Salente.
[02:13:36.346 --> 02:13:48.791]  And again, for folks that just joined us, people can subscribe and find out more at TrendsResearch.com and valuable weekly news blast and the quarterly magazine reports there at the key website, TrendsResearch.com.
[02:13:48.791 --> 02:13:53.934]  And he also has some other alternate URLs that'll get you to the same place, but Gerald,
[02:13:55.387 --> 02:13:58.109]  This is a transformation into classical tyranny.
[02:13:58.109 --> 02:13:59.230]  And what you just said is so true.
[02:13:59.230 --> 02:14:02.853]  Whenever I'm worried, whenever I'm upset, I'm not in fear.
[02:14:02.853 --> 02:14:04.935]  I'm more in a rage to defeat these people.
[02:14:04.935 --> 02:14:06.156]  And that is a good thing.
[02:14:06.156 --> 02:14:09.919]  But I'll just lay out under the trees and look at the blue sky and beauty.
[02:14:11.352 --> 02:14:14.557]  In my most instinctive level, the globalists are ugly.
[02:14:14.557 --> 02:14:16.099]  They create ugliness.
[02:14:16.099 --> 02:14:17.320]  They hate beauty.
[02:14:17.320 --> 02:14:18.482]  You look at the art they buy.
[02:14:18.482 --> 02:14:20.725]  They're into sickness.
[02:14:20.725 --> 02:14:25.651]  And I just feel like throwing myself into the gears to defeat them for beauty.
[02:14:26.232 --> 02:14:32.996]  The beauty of my innocent children, the beauty of innocence, the beauty of wholesomeness and private property and families.
[02:14:32.996 --> 02:14:34.577]  Everything they assault!
[02:14:34.577 --> 02:14:35.977]  And then I have no fear.
[02:14:35.977 --> 02:14:38.719]  I am ready to die if need be to defend beauty.
[02:14:38.719 --> 02:14:44.182]  And what you said right there is very touching because that is exactly what is in my soul.
[02:14:44.991 --> 02:14:47.434]  Yeah, we can't forget the human spirit.
[02:14:47.434 --> 02:14:49.776]  And that's what they've taken away from us.
[02:14:49.776 --> 02:14:53.861]  Because art is the way of finding the true meaning of the human spirit.
[02:14:53.861 --> 02:14:59.026]  Do you need any more proof than the Renaissance that was followed by the Black Death?
[02:14:59.026 --> 02:15:07.055]  Do you need any more proof when you see the greatness of the pyramids and the civilizations before of what beauty has created?
[02:15:07.495 --> 02:15:12.997]  This has become nothing more than a disgusting bottom-line society!
[02:15:12.997 --> 02:15:21.400]  Isn't it wonderful going into a Walmart, having the experience of walking into a large self-storage unit?
[02:15:21.400 --> 02:15:25.261]  So, we can change it, but we have to change ourselves.
[02:15:25.261 --> 02:15:29.063]  There's this great line, Alex, from the Hindus.
[02:15:29.063 --> 02:15:33.024]  When the student's ready, the teacher appears.
[02:15:33.024 --> 02:15:34.425]  The people have to get ready.
[02:15:35.265 --> 02:15:40.406]  They have to get in shape physically, emotionally, and spiritually.
[02:15:40.406 --> 02:15:46.988]  And the advertisers that you have on your show, help them get there.
[02:15:46.988 --> 02:15:47.728]  Absolutely.
[02:15:47.728 --> 02:15:52.349]  And folks, by funding alternative media, you're voting in the marketplace.
[02:15:52.349 --> 02:15:54.970]  You're listening to us on local AM and FM's, you're a business owner?
[02:15:54.970 --> 02:16:00.711]  Go sponsor that station and tell them, we're doing this because you put Alex Jones on weekdays.
[02:16:00.711 --> 02:16:02.472]  You put him on in prime time.
[02:16:02.472 --> 02:16:03.872]  Folks, it's happening.
[02:16:05.182 --> 02:16:09.449]  This message of liberty, the people are ready, but you've got to deliver it.
[02:16:09.449 --> 02:16:10.692]  Let's go to Alex in Illinois.
[02:16:10.692 --> 02:16:13.416]  You're on the air with our guest, Gerald Cilente.
[02:16:14.321 --> 02:16:17.842]  Hi Alex, hi Gerald, I appreciate your time and taking my call.
[02:16:17.842 --> 02:16:27.823]  Originally I called with a question about hyperinflation and whether or not, in your opinion, QE3 would actually lead to that scenario and how it would affect the working American's everyday life.
[02:16:27.823 --> 02:16:36.145]  But since I've been on hold listening, I'd actually like to change my question and I'd like to ask Gerald's opinion about CODIS Alimentarius and how he thinks that would affect the economy.
[02:16:36.145 --> 02:16:37.485]  Would it drive up food costs?
[02:16:37.485 --> 02:16:39.025]  Are we looking at food riots?
[02:16:39.025 --> 02:16:40.326]  Or what's that going to do?
[02:16:40.326 --> 02:16:42.326]  Oh yeah, they're going to have a monopoly to shut everything down!
[02:16:43.186 --> 02:16:44.167]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:16:44.167 --> 02:16:44.988]  Go ahead, Gerald.
[02:16:44.988 --> 02:16:45.729]  No, they are.
[02:16:45.729 --> 02:16:47.151]  Of course it's going to affect us.
[02:16:47.151 --> 02:16:49.733]  Worse than that, it's going to affect our health.
[02:16:49.733 --> 02:16:56.481]  And anybody that doesn't think that there's a... You know, you don't need to be a conspiracy theorist to talk about a New World Order.
[02:16:56.481 --> 02:16:59.764]  Just look at where the money goes from the Federal Reserve.
[02:16:59.764 --> 02:17:01.566]  What they call their discount window.
[02:17:01.566 --> 02:17:04.370]  It goes to most of the banks overseas.
[02:17:04.870 --> 02:17:10.112]  Look what happened when they found out $20 trillion of backdoor loans sent out.
[02:17:10.112 --> 02:17:11.353]  Where did it go?
[02:17:11.353 --> 02:17:13.293]  To banks overseas.
[02:17:13.293 --> 02:17:16.715]  It's a control by big pharma.
[02:17:16.715 --> 02:17:18.215]  That's all it is.
[02:17:18.215 --> 02:17:26.979]  They've turned this nation into a nation of junk food junkies and drug prescription addicts.
[02:17:27.759 --> 02:17:29.660]  I mean, can't you see it?
[02:17:29.660 --> 02:17:38.682]  And it's going to continue in that level with this more legislative... Gerald, I go to third world countries and the children have electricity in their eyes.
[02:17:38.682 --> 02:17:51.405]  I go to restaurants in places and the kids... I was in a restaurant this weekend and literally I couldn't find small children, ages 3 to say 10, who didn't act and behave mentally retarded.
[02:17:51.405 --> 02:17:53.565]  And look what we look like as a nation.
[02:17:53.565 --> 02:17:54.866]  You know my line, Alex?
[02:17:55.726 --> 02:17:57.928]  Break the chains.
[02:17:57.928 --> 02:18:01.090]  I don't buy, I don't eat chain food.
[02:18:01.090 --> 02:18:03.591]  I don't shop in chain stores.
[02:18:03.591 --> 02:18:06.393]  I buy everything I can local.
[02:18:06.393 --> 02:18:08.735]  And I believe in the golden rule.
[02:18:08.735 --> 02:18:09.435]  Both of them.
[02:18:09.435 --> 02:18:11.877]  Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
[02:18:11.877 --> 02:18:14.058]  And those that have the gold rule.
[02:18:14.058 --> 02:18:16.840]  And I don't dig the Chinese ruling me.
[02:18:16.840 --> 02:18:19.042]  It's bad enough right now.
[02:18:19.042 --> 02:18:22.004]  So you have to, we have to support each other.
[02:18:22.004 --> 02:18:23.905]  Absolutely, let's jam a call in here.
[02:18:23.905 --> 02:18:25.346]  Mary in New York, you're on the air.
[02:18:28.087 --> 02:18:30.348]  Go ahead, Mary.
[02:18:30.348 --> 02:18:33.069]  Okay, let's go to Mark.
[02:18:33.069 --> 02:18:33.409]  Go ahead.
[02:18:33.409 --> 02:18:37.151]  Hi, my name is Mark in Brooklyn.
[02:18:37.151 --> 02:18:38.891]  I love it when you're on the radio.
[02:18:38.891 --> 02:18:53.397]  My question is, for those of us who are unfortunately disabled and are living below the poverty line already, and we can't afford to buy gold and silver, what are the best things we can do to protect ourselves in this oncoming hell storm that we're facing?
[02:18:56.027 --> 02:18:58.969]  You know, it's really hard.
[02:18:58.969 --> 02:19:02.751]  Just keep making your voice heard as much as you can.
[02:19:02.751 --> 02:19:07.554]  Everything that you put into your body, you know, put the best you can.
[02:19:07.554 --> 02:19:11.116]  I have a dear friend of mine who's a quadriplegic.
[02:19:11.116 --> 02:19:12.197]  He lives out in Denver.
[02:19:15.526 --> 02:19:21.009]  He became a Buddhist and he said he couldn't make it through the day if he didn't meditate every day.
[02:19:21.009 --> 02:19:28.892]  And it goes back into getting in, as I said, shape as best you can physically, emotionally, and spiritually.
[02:19:28.892 --> 02:19:30.633]  That's the best we can do.
[02:19:30.633 --> 02:19:35.155]  And surround yourself, as I said, with the beauty that you can do.
[02:19:35.155 --> 02:19:37.456]  You know, beauty doesn't have to cost a lot of money.
[02:19:37.456 --> 02:19:40.497]  It means not buying crap.
[02:19:40.497 --> 02:19:43.519]  And it means associating with people that aren't
[02:19:44.139 --> 02:19:47.103]  Afflicted with negativity all the time.
[02:19:47.103 --> 02:19:47.764]  Absolutely.
[02:19:47.764 --> 02:19:54.114]  It's realizing how powerful you are and that you do have power and these globalists can be defeated.
[02:19:54.114 --> 02:19:56.197]  Gerald Cilente, amazing to talk to you.
[02:19:56.197 --> 02:19:59.001]  We'll see if he can stay five more minutes and take a few more calls.
[02:19:59.001 --> 02:19:59.962]  Then we're getting a Bilderberg report.
[02:20:00.856 --> 02:20:05.779]  Phase 1 of the Insiders' plan for a One World Government has been initiated with the recent bailout.
[02:20:05.779 --> 02:20:13.224]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new World Bank to act as saviour.
[02:20:13.224 --> 02:20:14.845]  But we've only seen the beginning.
[02:20:14.845 --> 02:20:18.708]  Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times.
[02:20:18.968 --> 02:20:22.811]  Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land.
[02:20:22.811 --> 02:20:27.293]  The insiders have discovered that they must control two things to seize total power.
[02:20:27.293 --> 02:20:31.616]  Phase 1 is a one-world currency, which we are currently being prepared to accept.
[02:20:31.616 --> 02:20:34.258]  Phase 2 of their insidious plan is complete control.
[02:20:34.278 --> 02:20:34.558]  I think so.
[02:21:01.869 --> 02:21:05.250]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.
[02:21:05.250 --> 02:21:13.434]  I designed our top-selling holster, the SuperTuck Deluxe, to solve the problems of being poked, pinched, and gouged while carrying concealed.
[02:21:13.434 --> 02:21:18.756]  The SuperTuck Deluxe is the most comfortable, most concealable holster on the market today.
[02:21:18.756 --> 02:21:21.737]  We offer a two-week free trial and a lifetime warranty.
[02:21:21.737 --> 02:21:25.638]  Visit us at crossbreedholsters.com.
[02:21:25.638 --> 02:21:28.840]  Don't forget, crossbreedholsters.com.
[02:21:30.240 --> 02:21:31.481]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:21:31.481 --> 02:21:36.044]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:21:36.044 --> 02:21:41.868]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:21:41.868 --> 02:21:45.490]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:21:45.490 --> 02:21:48.212]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:48.212 --> 02:21:53.275]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:21:53.275 --> 02:21:53.576]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:53.576 --> 02:21:54.917]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:00.380 --> 02:22:02.782]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:22:02.782 --> 02:22:05.084]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:22:05.084 --> 02:22:08.306]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:22:08.306 --> 02:22:13.410]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:22:13.410 --> 02:22:17.613]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:22:17.913 --> 02:22:20.256]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:22:20.256 --> 02:22:22.820]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:22:22.820 --> 02:22:26.064]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:22:26.064 --> 02:22:33.674]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:22:33.996 --> 02:22:39.381]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:22:39.381 --> 02:22:42.244]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:22:42.244 --> 02:22:45.928]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:22:45.928 --> 02:22:47.009]  And I got news for you.
[02:22:47.009 --> 02:22:48.350]  You're everyone else.
[02:22:48.350 --> 02:22:49.851]  Invisible Empire.

[02:23:52.853 --> 02:23:55.715]  Spelled L-E-C-I-G.com.
[02:23:55.715 --> 02:24:04.861]  Lecig e-cigarettes for today's modern smoker.
[02:24:04.861 --> 02:24:06.802]  Final segment with Gerald Cilente.
[02:24:06.802 --> 02:24:09.164]  I'll try to cram in some of your calls.
[02:24:09.164 --> 02:24:10.465]  And regardless, I'll get to everybody.
[02:24:12.389 --> 02:24:16.191]  Later in the transmission, we're going back to Vildenberg Group to cover what's happening there in Switzerland.
[02:24:16.191 --> 02:24:19.974]  We've gotten the big inside scoop on what's going on.
[02:24:19.974 --> 02:24:26.398]  Again, I want to encourage everybody to support the alternative media and support themselves.
[02:24:26.398 --> 02:24:28.119]  Support those that tell the truth.
[02:24:28.119 --> 02:24:32.062]  That's voting with your dollars to build the liberty movement against tyranny.
[02:24:32.947 --> 02:24:39.371]  Now, one of the great outposts of truth in this system of lies is the Trends Research Journal.
[02:24:39.371 --> 02:24:42.353]  TrendsResearch.com with founder Gerald Cilente.
[02:24:42.353 --> 02:24:47.136]  Find out about it at TrendsResearch.com.
[02:24:47.136 --> 02:24:53.579]  I want to just jam in one final phone call here for now with Gerald, or maybe two, but quick questions.
[02:24:53.579 --> 02:24:55.801]  Tim in Washington, you're on the air with Gerald Cilente.
[02:24:57.492 --> 02:24:59.256]  Good afternoon gentlemen, how's it going today?
[02:24:59.256 --> 02:24:59.837]  Good.
[02:24:59.837 --> 02:25:08.955]  I was kind of curious, I've been doing some research in history and it comes to find out that these bankers have amassed a mercenary army to imprison the population.
[02:25:09.677 --> 02:25:13.560]  Is there a way to reverse that by amassing our own mercenary army to imprison them?
[02:25:39.917 --> 02:25:41.639]  Let the people vote.
[02:25:41.639 --> 02:25:43.000]  This is America.
[02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:45.081]  I don't need Pelosi.
[02:25:45.081 --> 02:25:46.783]  I don't need Bonner.
[02:25:46.783 --> 02:25:52.087]  I don't need any of them telling me what I should think or what I should believe.
[02:25:52.087 --> 02:25:54.309]  I've had it.
[02:25:54.309 --> 02:25:56.311]  We could make it happen, Alex.
[02:25:56.311 --> 02:25:58.172]  We could do it through the Internet.
[02:25:58.172 --> 02:26:00.234]  It's Journalism 2.0.
[02:26:00.234 --> 02:26:02.536]  It's Democracy 2.0.
[02:26:02.536 --> 02:26:03.736]  Let the people vote.
[02:26:04.738 --> 02:26:24.519]  Well, going back to something you just mentioned, the Pentagon for at least two decades has said that 90% of their operations are psychological, and they admit they do it against the American people, where people will just slit their wrists if they're told it's for the military, but then when the military's being hurt by the bankers, people say, well, that's fine, because the TV didn't tell me that was a problem.
[02:26:26.141 --> 02:26:29.363]  Nine times out of ten, it is psychological.
[02:26:29.363 --> 02:26:31.424]  That's why they try to dumb us down.
[02:26:31.424 --> 02:26:39.569]  If we rise above and become aware of what they've done, and wake up to the false narratives they've given us, we can defeat these people.
[02:26:39.569 --> 02:26:40.870]  They're a paper tiger.
[02:26:40.870 --> 02:26:42.431]  Exactly, and I've been there.
[02:26:42.431 --> 02:26:44.732]  I used to work in the New York State Senate.
[02:26:44.732 --> 02:26:46.333]  I worked in Washington, D.C.
[02:26:46.333 --> 02:26:47.634]  I know what it looks like.
[02:26:47.634 --> 02:26:48.474]  They're nothing!
[02:26:48.474 --> 02:26:50.535]  They're a bunch of wieners!
[02:26:50.535 --> 02:26:51.056]  Capisce?
[02:26:51.576 --> 02:26:54.039]  How much more do you have to know?
[02:26:54.039 --> 02:26:55.461]  Look at this guy.
[02:26:55.461 --> 02:26:58.184]  There are 500 and something of him.
[02:26:58.184 --> 02:27:02.910]  They're all alike with the exception of a few, like a Ron Paul.
[02:27:02.910 --> 02:27:04.712]  A few men out there.
[02:27:04.712 --> 02:27:06.635]  The rest are wieners.
[02:27:06.635 --> 02:27:08.617]  And I'd also like to say this, Alex.
[02:27:09.398 --> 02:27:12.720]  That this is a very crucial time.
[02:27:12.720 --> 02:27:15.801]  If we don't act now, we're lost.
[02:27:15.801 --> 02:27:23.705]  So everybody should stand up, speak out, expose the hypocrites for who they are.
[02:27:24.545 --> 02:27:25.226]  God bless you.
[02:27:25.226 --> 02:27:25.847]  Great job.
[02:27:25.847 --> 02:27:27.369]  The Bilderberg protest.
[02:27:27.369 --> 02:27:36.762]  People all over Europe converging this next Saturday and three days at high noon as we got three days to get this going.
[02:27:36.762 --> 02:27:39.125]  Ladies and gentlemen, they're in Switzerland.
[02:27:39.125 --> 02:27:39.645]  Go there.
[02:27:40.286 --> 02:27:43.969]  The Swiss people, go there and let the criminals know you're aware of them.
[02:27:43.969 --> 02:27:45.931]  Contact the media, demand they cover it.
[02:27:45.931 --> 02:27:49.553]  Identify the criminals that have engineered this, are meeting there.
[02:27:49.553 --> 02:27:51.715]  We now have learned a large part of their agenda.
[02:27:51.715 --> 02:27:55.778]  That'll be breaking soon at InfoWars.com with Kurt Nemo and a written article.
[02:27:55.778 --> 02:27:57.279]  Hopefully it'll be up at Drudge.
[02:27:57.279 --> 02:28:03.324]  We just had fragmentary reports so far because we've been collating audio, video, and still shots up at the site.
[02:28:03.664 --> 02:28:09.886]  And the exclusive live video and photos from Bilderberg, continually updated section at Infowars.com.
[02:28:09.886 --> 02:28:14.788]  Gerald Cilente, we'll talk to you again very soon, and I'm looking forward to seeing you Saturday night in New York.
[02:28:14.788 --> 02:28:16.729]  All right, great.
[02:28:16.729 --> 02:28:17.669]  Thank you so much.
[02:28:17.669 --> 02:28:24.712]  We're going to have dinner, Ted Anderson, myself, and him after I give the speech.
[02:28:24.712 --> 02:28:25.852]  I'm flying back Sunday, right?
[02:28:25.852 --> 02:28:26.472]  Not Saturday night.
[02:28:26.472 --> 02:28:28.133]  I think I am flying back Sunday morning.
[02:28:28.133 --> 02:28:30.174]  Because I usually just go into New York, boom, get out.
[02:28:30.174 --> 02:28:30.994]  And I thought, well, why not?
[02:28:31.909 --> 02:28:34.296]  Maybe go to the museum or something after I give the speech.
[02:28:34.296 --> 02:28:36.401]  I won't be hanging around, I know that.
[02:28:36.401 --> 02:28:38.507]  Sean Hannity might try to get me, I'm joking.
[02:28:40.006 --> 02:28:42.187]  At the event at Talkers 2011.
[02:28:42.187 --> 02:28:52.209]  I have done two hours and 28 minutes here, and I've just barely mentioned that if you want to support what we're doing, buy the books, buy the videos, buy the tapes.
[02:28:52.209 --> 02:28:58.111]  We got a special running right now, Endgame 995 covers the Bilderberg whole agenda, the world government plan.
[02:28:58.111 --> 02:29:04.213]  The film's three and a half years old, and it's more powerful today because people watch it and go, wow, did you just make this this week?
[02:29:04.213 --> 02:29:05.633]  Everything you said was gonna happen, happened.

[02:31:06.082 --> 02:31:09.943]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:31:09.943 --> 02:31:12.244]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:31:12.244 --> 02:31:18.106]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[02:31:18.106 --> 02:31:24.328]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[02:31:24.768 --> 02:31:30.750]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:31:30.750 --> 02:31:34.911]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:31:34.911 --> 02:31:39.212]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:31:39.212 --> 02:31:45.154]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[02:31:45.154 --> 02:31:48.715]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:31:48.715 --> 02:31:50.696]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:31:50.696 --> 02:31:51.116]  It's here.

[02:32:57.281 --> 02:32:58.062]  Got it.
[02:32:58.062 --> 02:32:58.862]  Others don't.
[02:33:12.576 --> 02:33:17.458]  Is it getting better?
[02:33:17.458 --> 02:33:22.801]  Or do you feel the same?
[02:33:22.801 --> 02:33:24.862]  Will it make it easier on you now?
[02:33:24.862 --> 02:33:38.429]  You've got someone to blame You said one love One life When it's one need
[02:33:40.100 --> 02:33:47.103]  Monday through Friday we're here live from 11 a.m.
[02:33:47.103 --> 02:33:47.983]  until 2 p.m.
[02:33:47.983 --> 02:33:58.568]  Central Standard Time and we're getting lined up from Bilderberg 2011 Aaron Dykes and Paul Watson coming up here hopefully in a few minutes we had them online but it dropped
[02:33:59.168 --> 02:34:00.749]  Skype's having issues.
[02:34:00.749 --> 02:34:02.850]  I may just dispatch him back up to the hotel.
[02:34:02.850 --> 02:34:04.271]  We can just do it from the mountaintop.
[02:34:04.271 --> 02:34:06.071]  That obviously had better internet.
[02:34:06.071 --> 02:34:08.352]  Of course, the globalists have the best internet.
[02:34:08.352 --> 02:34:12.594]  We're down the hill, little slaves below them, in one of the cheaper hotels.
[02:34:12.594 --> 02:34:13.715]  It's only 300 euros a night.
[02:34:16.713 --> 02:34:19.975]  So we're going to be talking to them very soon and a lot of other important breaking news.
[02:34:19.975 --> 02:34:27.660]  We're going to try to make history together here with this big demonstration against Bilderberg Group and their tyranny and their forced austerity.
[02:34:27.660 --> 02:34:30.121]  People all over Europe are getting angry and demonstrating.
[02:34:30.121 --> 02:34:36.746]  The enemy, the people that did all this, the people that need to be exposed in the Infowar peacefully are the Bilderberg Group.
[02:34:37.546 --> 02:34:37.646]  And
[02:34:57.483 --> 02:34:58.504]  You don't have any excuse.
[02:34:58.504 --> 02:35:02.206]  This Saturday, high noon, I'm calling for it, okay?
[02:35:02.206 --> 02:35:03.327]  And we'll be here covering it.
[02:35:03.327 --> 02:35:07.970]  We'll have live feeds at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:35:07.970 --> 02:35:11.572]  But on our end, as I said, this costs money.
[02:35:11.572 --> 02:35:13.914]  And Ted Anderson of Midas Resources financed this.
[02:35:13.914 --> 02:35:20.158]  And again, he has radio specials where you can get three silver dollars and three of my best-selling films and free shipping.
[02:35:20.158 --> 02:35:23.380]  So you pay for the silver dollars at an incredibly low price.
[02:35:23.380 --> 02:35:24.580]  You can call him.
[02:35:24.580 --> 02:35:26.241]  It varies depending on the market.
[02:35:27.162 --> 02:35:28.102]  That actually doesn't vary.
[02:35:28.102 --> 02:35:32.864]  He changes it every week or so if silver goes up or down, but they got super good deals on that.
[02:35:32.864 --> 02:35:37.066]  Three silver dollars, and you get three of my films free, and free shipping.
[02:35:37.066 --> 02:35:40.187]  I mean, nobody can top that, and I know Ted has no markup on that deal.
[02:35:40.187 --> 02:35:44.209]  It's a lost leader, but that's what he wants pitched for his sponsorship of this.
[02:35:44.209 --> 02:35:44.729]  So, 800-686-2237.
[02:35:44.729 --> 02:35:44.769]  800-686-2237.
[02:35:53.257 --> 02:35:56.818]  If you want to call Midas Resources, they've got other radio specials.
[02:35:56.818 --> 02:36:09.183]  All their deals are very competitive, many of them smoking, but the radio specials, they have a whole list of them, and the brokers are there, 30 plus of them, I guess it's upwards of 50 now, with the sheet of the specials, and it's boom.
[02:36:09.183 --> 02:36:11.143]  No haggle, this is the deal you want, boom.
[02:36:11.143 --> 02:36:11.664]  800-686-2237, 800-686-237.
[02:36:11.664 --> 02:36:14.124]  Now, let me compose myself before we go to the guys.
[02:36:22.265 --> 02:36:26.571]  And really focused on all the incredible information that we've just learned.
[02:36:26.571 --> 02:36:28.453]  But I want to add one caveat.
[02:36:28.453 --> 02:36:30.115]  Obviously, I'll do 15-20 minutes of overdrive.
[02:36:31.952 --> 02:36:37.036]  And some station managers have said, well, that's fine that you do overdrive, we understand that.
[02:36:37.036 --> 02:36:42.319]  We really pioneered that, and Glenn Beck and Howard Stern have copied it, and that's wonderful.
[02:36:42.319 --> 02:36:45.601]  You know, we started the fourth hour, I don't know, five years ago.
[02:36:45.601 --> 02:36:49.004]  And that's what Beck calls it, his fourth hour, that's only internet.
[02:36:49.004 --> 02:36:51.345]  But I said, why not just make the fourth hour on satellite now?
[02:36:51.345 --> 02:36:54.967]  So I did that for a few years, where it was actually on the radio too, stations picked it up.
[02:36:54.967 --> 02:36:59.390]  But now I'm getting ready to launch my new TV show that Beck's copying, which again, I think is great.
[02:36:59.390 --> 02:37:01.312]  That's the most sincere form of flattery is imitation.
[02:37:02.673 --> 02:37:07.196]  And so I had to cut that fourth hour, but then I get greedy wanting to fight the globalist.
[02:37:07.196 --> 02:37:08.337]  I'm greedy for truth.
[02:37:08.337 --> 02:37:10.979]  I'm like an attack dog who wants more.
[02:37:10.979 --> 02:37:13.281]  And so I'll do 20 minutes or so in the next hour.
[02:37:13.281 --> 02:37:16.063]  But when you hear the show in on AM and FM, the show's over.
[02:37:16.063 --> 02:37:17.865]  Tune into their next great show.
[02:37:17.865 --> 02:37:18.285]  Wonderful.
[02:37:18.285 --> 02:37:19.746]  Support their sponsors.
[02:37:19.746 --> 02:37:22.268]  Only every once in a while do I do this overdrive.
[02:37:22.268 --> 02:37:24.850]  Soon when I start this TV show, I won't be able to do it anymore.
[02:37:24.850 --> 02:37:26.251]  So this won't be an issue anymore.
[02:37:26.251 --> 02:37:28.853]  But we will do about 20 minutes of overdrive in the next hour.
[02:37:30.374 --> 02:37:33.176]  And that way I can get into some of the other news.
[02:37:33.176 --> 02:37:37.439]  But we've got 23 minutes left in the official transmission.
[02:37:37.439 --> 02:37:40.501]  I want to just say great job to my crew here as well.
[02:37:40.501 --> 02:37:45.405]  You can follow everything we're doing at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:37:45.405 --> 02:37:49.688]  I can also go into OverDrive and take some of the callers that are holding if you want to hold or we'll open the phones up again then.
[02:37:50.967 --> 02:37:56.549]  We have this top story, exclusive live video and photos from Bilderberg, continually updated.
[02:37:56.549 --> 02:38:01.751]  Then I have another report intimidating the media.
[02:38:01.751 --> 02:38:05.372]  Bilderberg security sees InfoWars reporter's passport.
[02:38:05.372 --> 02:38:06.313]  I think I'll change that.
[02:38:06.313 --> 02:38:09.014]  He is an InfoWars reporter, but he's really an RT reporter.
[02:38:09.014 --> 02:38:12.235]  And that was the headline I wanted, but we're going to have that changed and beefed up a bit.
[02:38:12.235 --> 02:38:14.596]  It's just a blurb with video of it happening.
[02:38:14.596 --> 02:38:18.257]  Also, Bilderberg's may give green light to Mexican
[02:38:18.937 --> 02:38:21.902]  Uh, central banker at new IMF boss.
[02:38:21.902 --> 02:38:23.244]  That's big.
[02:38:23.244 --> 02:38:27.291]  Also, uh, the exclusive live video photos for Bilderberg continually updated.
[02:38:27.291 --> 02:38:28.253]  That is so important.
[02:38:29.332 --> 02:38:32.773]  Also another link exclusive reportage live from Switzerland on the Bilderbergs.
[02:38:32.773 --> 02:38:36.153]  But Kurt's got his big report coming out.
[02:38:36.153 --> 02:38:39.814]  I'll tell you the headline here in about 10 minutes when it goes live.
[02:38:39.814 --> 02:38:46.856]  But the big kahuna report, the leaked inside agenda of Bilderberg, breaking here, coming up in 10 minutes.
[02:38:46.856 --> 02:38:51.857]  Let's go to Paul Joseph Watson joining us from nearby the Bilderberg group meeting.
[02:38:51.857 --> 02:38:53.137]  He was on site earlier.
[02:38:53.137 --> 02:38:55.438]  He's going to go back soon.
[02:38:55.438 --> 02:38:57.078]  But Paul Watson, thanks for joining us.
[02:38:58.442 --> 02:38:59.343]  Good to be here, Alex.
[02:39:14.813 --> 02:39:21.358]  Um, what happened afterwards was, uh, basically we just hung around for a little longer.
[02:39:21.358 --> 02:39:34.048]  There were groups of young people actually entering the Build-a-Bit compound, but we guessed that it's because they live further down in the area and they had credentials that they were wearing around their neck.
[02:39:34.048 --> 02:39:37.571]  They showed to the police and they were let in.
[02:39:37.571 --> 02:39:43.076]  Um, then after that we were just talking to some more people and taking some more photographs.
[02:39:43.736 --> 02:39:54.247]  We left and some ways down the road, a good probably half a mile down the road, there were more police with dogs.
[02:39:54.247 --> 02:39:59.933]  So it's not just around the hotel itself, they're on surrounding roads.
[02:39:59.933 --> 02:40:06.000]  As he stated earlier, Luke Radowski, and the video is up on Infowars.com,
[02:40:06.781 --> 02:40:16.388]  Was asked for his passport and they kept his passport for about half an hour before he got it back and basically told him if you don't hand it over we're going to arrest you.
[02:40:16.388 --> 02:40:24.133]  We weren't asked, we went right up to the security point where the barriers were and they didn't ask us for any ID.
[02:40:24.133 --> 02:40:30.798]  And at the moment we're just getting all the high quality photos posted on Infowars and Prison Planet.
[02:40:32.261 --> 02:40:46.530]  Well, Paul, you don't know about this yet, but I've got your brother from London, Steve Watson, a master's in political science in his own right, and I point that out because he's one of the smartest people I know, along with Paul.
[02:40:46.530 --> 02:40:48.231]  Just great researchers.
[02:40:48.231 --> 02:40:53.514]  You're guys I can just call who immediately get it and already have a full-spectrum understanding of what's going on.
[02:40:53.514 --> 02:40:55.716]  He's doing a report that'll go up on Prison Planet.
[02:40:55.716 --> 02:40:57.317]  We've got two big things breaking.
[02:40:57.317 --> 02:40:58.778]  We've got the agenda of Bilderberg.
[02:40:59.478 --> 02:41:05.099]  From the mole, via Tucker and others, a large part of the agenda.
[02:41:05.099 --> 02:41:06.680]  We're trying to get an actual rundown.
[02:41:06.680 --> 02:41:11.341]  Sometimes Tucker's even able to get that from his mole, but the mole's got to sneak off site to do it.
[02:41:11.341 --> 02:41:18.583]  That's another thing, you've got to follow Tucker some, because he's always got people, cars following him, and spies outside his room, and he was shot at in Portugal.
[02:41:18.583 --> 02:41:21.823]  That was reported on by major newspapers in 99.
[02:41:21.823 --> 02:41:26.004]  So obviously you're going to go get the latest intel from Tucker.
[02:41:26.004 --> 02:41:27.385]  Keep filing reports on that.
[02:41:28.425 --> 02:41:29.747]  We've got all of this unfolding.
[02:41:29.747 --> 02:41:38.121]  Feel free to do more of the upload videos that you're doing that we have a live link up on InfoWars.com of throughout the evening, throughout tomorrow.
[02:41:38.121 --> 02:41:40.104]  It officially kicks off tomorrow.
[02:41:41.055 --> 02:41:51.537]  But the big news, my friend, is I'm calling for a global protest against the austerity bankers who we know are meeting there at this event, pushing for bigger bailouts, i.e.
[02:41:51.537 --> 02:41:52.937]  thefts for them.
[02:41:52.937 --> 02:41:54.918]  We know that that is happening.
[02:41:54.918 --> 02:41:58.259]  We know they're there trying to start the new war in the Middle East, a wider war.
[02:41:58.259 --> 02:41:59.839]  We know they're pushing for Internet censorship.
[02:41:59.839 --> 02:42:02.899]  We know their agenda now, a large portion of it.
[02:42:02.899 --> 02:42:05.260]  And so we're going to have a massive protest.
[02:42:05.820 --> 02:42:07.683]  Saturday at noon in St.
[02:42:07.683 --> 02:42:08.764]  Moritz, Switzerland.
[02:42:08.764 --> 02:42:11.167]  We're calling for the Swiss to come out.
[02:42:11.167 --> 02:42:12.729]  The redcoats aren't coming.
[02:42:12.729 --> 02:42:14.070]  The banksters are coming.
[02:42:14.070 --> 02:42:15.592]  We're calling for peaceful demonstration.
[02:42:15.592 --> 02:42:17.114]  We're calling people to call the media.
[02:42:17.114 --> 02:42:18.375]  Demand they be there.
[02:42:18.375 --> 02:42:19.977]  And for folks from all over Europe.
[02:42:20.538 --> 02:42:28.221]  Instead of just protesting at police stations and being water cannoned, peacefully come here and say, there are the criminals, there are the people.
[02:42:28.221 --> 02:42:31.463]  A lot of Bilderberg people can't even go because there's indictments out.
[02:42:31.463 --> 02:42:33.323]  We'll see if Kissinger shows up.
[02:42:33.323 --> 02:42:34.524]  But that's the big announcement.
[02:42:34.524 --> 02:42:35.364]  Get it out to everybody.
[02:42:35.364 --> 02:42:36.825]  Everybody Twitter it, tweet it.
[02:42:36.825 --> 02:42:38.706]  Steve's going to have it out very soon at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:42:40.697 --> 02:42:41.357]  Okay, great.
[02:42:41.357 --> 02:42:42.998]  Aaron, you're now there on with Paul.
[02:42:42.998 --> 02:42:51.984]  Paul, what do you make of this announcement that we're going to have this big protest and then talk about what you make of all this security and everything else that's happening?
[02:42:51.984 --> 02:42:56.907]  Well, there were about 20 to 25 people there at the time that we went.
[02:42:58.220 --> 02:43:12.043]  And to be honest, from what I saw in Spain on the videos last year, and certainly Greece, if you remember Greece and Turkey, there were just mass protests in the streets, hundreds and thousands of people, so we definitely need more people there.
[02:43:12.043 --> 02:43:27.186]  Obviously, this is a remote area, and it takes a while to drive to from the airport, but we definitely need as many people as possible to throw the spotlight on these Bilderberg criminals that are meeting up in the mountains at the moment.
[02:43:28.939 --> 02:43:37.384]  Now, Paul, again, I can rant all day and make my points, but we need everybody to get Twitters out, phone calls, news websites.
[02:43:37.384 --> 02:43:42.227]  The Google search term today, we've got to make it number one, Bilderberg protest.
[02:43:42.227 --> 02:43:45.249]  Two words entered into Google and Yahoo and everywhere else over and over again.
[02:43:45.249 --> 02:43:47.311]  Everybody write your own articles.
[02:43:47.311 --> 02:43:50.753]  Get global attention onto this Bilderberg protest.
[02:43:50.753 --> 02:43:53.655]  You can also reverse it and then say protest Bilderberg.
[02:43:54.474 --> 02:43:54.754]  Okay.
[02:44:10.703 --> 02:44:12.104]  Bilderberg protest.
[02:44:12.104 --> 02:44:13.085]  Put those words in.
[02:44:13.085 --> 02:44:16.367]  I'm even doing it myself during the break in the Google box.
[02:44:16.367 --> 02:44:25.212]  We need to make that number one in the global call, and I want to make sure I need to call Steve back to make sure in his article that he explains these are the bankers, these are the crooks.
[02:44:25.212 --> 02:44:27.234]  Why protest in your capitals?
[02:44:27.234 --> 02:44:29.535]  Your capitals have been bought off by these criminals.
[02:44:29.535 --> 02:44:33.078]  Go to where the real scum is this Saturday, high noon.
[02:44:33.078 --> 02:44:34.839]  That gives us three days to build up, Paul.
[02:44:36.587 --> 02:44:53.812]  That's right, and if you're flying into Zurich Airport, it's about a two and a half hour drive out there, and the scenery is just breathtaking, so even if you don't get anything else out of it, I mean, the place itself is beautiful, and it's just a shame that the people meeting here are not.
[02:44:54.915 --> 02:45:01.078]  Well, France, of course, Austria and Italy are right there.
[02:45:01.078 --> 02:45:02.739]  We're talking hours from this.
[02:45:02.739 --> 02:45:06.620]  But in the Swiss, and we have a lot of listeners in Switzerland, we're rated as one of the top sites there.
[02:45:06.620 --> 02:45:07.501]  Get there!
[02:45:07.501 --> 02:45:08.541]  Go there!
[02:45:08.541 --> 02:45:09.081]  Go there!
[02:45:09.081 --> 02:45:11.162]  It's your right to say no to the criminals.
[02:45:11.162 --> 02:45:12.463]  The mafia is meeting.
[02:45:12.463 --> 02:45:14.344]  Let the world know we're not putting up with it.
[02:45:14.884 --> 02:45:18.746]  A lot of times the mafia hires communists to come out and protest to make folks look bad.
[02:45:18.746 --> 02:45:22.087]  Let's have true liberty patriots there explaining who's there.
[02:45:22.087 --> 02:45:23.167]  I gotta call Steve Bags.
[02:45:23.167 --> 02:45:24.068]  He's got a mixture in the article.
[02:45:24.068 --> 02:45:29.510]  He explained these are the people bringing in another wave of economic implosion and global austerity.
[02:45:29.510 --> 02:45:32.491]  Paul, video can't capture what you see with your eyes.
[02:45:32.491 --> 02:45:33.991]  Any other observations?
[02:45:33.991 --> 02:45:36.713]  How were the police's mannerisms?
[02:45:36.713 --> 02:45:37.993]  What was their bearing?
[02:45:37.993 --> 02:45:42.695]  Were they robotic or were they looking at you as if you were scum or were they friendly?
[02:45:44.793 --> 02:45:50.554]  They were giving us the eyeball, but on the whole they didn't really harass us at all.
[02:45:50.554 --> 02:45:53.135]  They let us film, they let us video record.
[02:45:53.135 --> 02:45:59.236]  Other people were saying there were police carrying around guns, but we didn't see any guns.
[02:45:59.236 --> 02:46:04.337]  Some of them appeared to have some kind of paser device, although that could have just been a baton.
[02:46:04.337 --> 02:46:05.718]  The Swiss are the most heavily armed.
[02:46:05.718 --> 02:46:06.178]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:46:07.449 --> 02:46:16.760]  There were other people who were saying that there were people in the streets down in the actual town itself, because the hotel was up in the hills.
[02:46:16.760 --> 02:46:20.785]  There were secret police walking around asking for people's IDs.
[02:46:20.785 --> 02:46:23.728]  That's what the journalists who were already there told us.
[02:46:24.569 --> 02:46:44.654]  Uh, but from what we saw, certainly if you compare it to what Charlie Skelton experienced in, uh, Greece, where he was constantly harassed and arrested and followed around, uh, the security and the police were reasonably, um, kind, was in that they didn't harass us or ask for ID or anything, but of course there's a long way to go.
[02:46:45.114 --> 02:46:45.914]  Yeah, in the U.S.
[02:46:45.914 --> 02:46:52.136]  they did some of that and would try to tell us to turn the cameras off, but after we told them we weren't going to do it, then they behaved themselves in Virginia.
[02:46:52.136 --> 02:46:59.138]  And it's a shame that the cops are so willing to energetically protect literally a bunch of criminals.
[02:46:59.138 --> 02:47:02.059]  I mean, these people are globalist tyrants.
[02:47:02.719 --> 02:47:12.686]  And we're streaming video right now from Justin TV also of Luke talking about how he was detained for 40 minutes and had his passport taken.
[02:47:12.686 --> 02:47:15.408]  Stay on the line, Paul, but we've got Aaron Dykes there with us.
[02:47:15.408 --> 02:47:22.894]  Aaron, what are your observations at the first day, the prelude to the kickoff tomorrow morning of the Global Crime Syndicate meeting?
[02:47:24.130 --> 02:47:34.358]  Well, Alex, to start with the literal, I'm literally looking at the hotel where the Bilderbergers are staying right now from my hotel window, along with these gorgeous mountains.
[02:47:34.358 --> 02:47:42.925]  And frankly, like Paul was saying, I'd rather turn my attention to the natural beauty, but we can't ignore what they're doing on this planet and the way they're controlling.
[02:47:42.925 --> 02:47:50.371]  But one major contradiction, I did in fact see police with sidearms, and I'm not sure if the security also had them.
[02:47:51.291 --> 02:47:58.715]  But I definitely saw pistols and there was a baton which may have also been one of those tasing baton devices.
[02:47:58.715 --> 02:47:59.375]  We don't know for sure.
[02:47:59.375 --> 02:48:07.299]  But it's not the usual thing in Italy or in Spain or in Greece where they have submachine guns they shove in your face.
[02:48:09.179 --> 02:48:12.943]  No, we haven't seen the submachine gun people here yet.
[02:48:12.943 --> 02:48:15.266]  Perhaps, you know, tomorrow could be another day.
[02:48:15.266 --> 02:48:17.088]  They're not there right now.
[02:48:17.088 --> 02:48:17.849]  They were not there earlier.
[02:48:17.849 --> 02:48:18.430]  Well, I'll say this.
[02:48:18.430 --> 02:48:24.997]  I don't have a problem with the cops being like that in Switzerland, because the citizens can run around with their fully autos and hand grenades, and they have the lowest crime rate in the world.
[02:48:24.997 --> 02:48:25.678]  So I think it's great.
[02:48:25.678 --> 02:48:27.420]  More guns, less crime.
[02:48:27.420 --> 02:48:29.182]  Other points, Aaron, that are key for folks to know?
[02:48:32.358 --> 02:48:36.502]  Well, we're just obviously going to keep an eye on what's going on.
[02:48:36.502 --> 02:48:39.765]  We know the groups they're part of and how their agendas merge.
[02:48:39.765 --> 02:48:42.708]  So we're going to have those points come out.
[02:48:42.708 --> 02:48:46.952]  As you know, a lot of the talking points have come out from the past years of things they've discussed.
[02:48:47.612 --> 02:48:52.560]  And among it are the Arab Spring and the revolutions of the Middle East.
[02:48:52.560 --> 02:48:56.305]  They talked about that at 2010 in Sinti, Spain.
[02:48:56.305 --> 02:49:02.675]  And I really expect to see an escalation of that agenda for the rest of this year.
[02:49:04.375 --> 02:49:04.936]  Amazing.
[02:49:04.936 --> 02:49:13.606]  I want to come back and talk strategy, but in the next 10-15 minutes, Kurt, that's why we're going into overdrive for internet listeners only at Infowars.com.
[02:49:13.606 --> 02:49:18.571]  That's why Kurt Nimmo is in there laboring on this big report.
[02:49:19.485 --> 02:49:19.645]  That
[02:49:36.834 --> 02:49:37.254]  Thanks for
[02:49:53.502 --> 02:49:56.464]  Standing up to Obama and going to war with UN authority.
[02:49:56.464 --> 02:49:59.025]  I mean, it'd be bad if the President did it on his own.
[02:49:59.025 --> 02:50:03.108]  It's even worse to do it and say, I have UN authority and not talk to Congress.
[02:50:03.108 --> 02:50:04.509]  So that's going on.
[02:50:04.509 --> 02:50:07.350]  They're moved to go after the alternative media.
[02:50:07.350 --> 02:50:10.873]  The fact that they're scared of the alternative media and the awakening to them.
[02:50:10.873 --> 02:50:12.033]  We've got a large part of it.
[02:50:12.033 --> 02:50:15.455]  Now, Tucker's going to get more Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
[02:50:15.455 --> 02:50:18.477]  We'll have continual coverage here for you, gentlemen.
[02:50:18.477 --> 02:50:21.019]  But when we come back, I want to get other key points from you, then I'll
[02:50:21.539 --> 02:50:27.303]  Go into the next hour, cover the latest breaking news, take some phone calls and some other news I haven't gotten to yet.
[02:50:27.303 --> 02:50:28.724]  But gentlemen, we're about to go to break.
[02:50:28.724 --> 02:50:30.766]  Paul, what are some other tidbits we'll cover on the other side?
[02:50:32.645 --> 02:50:35.867]  Well, there are numerous reports that have come out in the past few hours.
[02:50:35.867 --> 02:50:52.319]  There's one from Swiss Info, there's another from expatica.com, there's Charlie Skelton's Brower report, and most of them are quite generic, downplaying the event, so we can discuss how the media's covering this on the other side.
[02:50:53.283 --> 02:50:55.205]  All right, stay there, stand by.
[02:50:55.205 --> 02:51:01.410]  We've got the reporters, we've got the will, we've got the intel, and the big protest is on Saturday high noon.
[02:51:01.410 --> 02:51:04.833]  The largest part of gaining radiant health is detoxification.
[02:51:04.833 --> 02:51:12.079]  You can drink ionized water, cleanse your intestines, eat a perfect diet, and even take lots of quality supplements and in many instances only make minimal progress.
[02:51:12.659 --> 02:51:17.221]  What is the key to detoxifying your body of mercury, heavy metals, chemicals, and drugs?
[02:51:17.221 --> 02:51:18.662]  It is glutathione.
[02:51:18.662 --> 02:51:22.724]  Glutathione is the master antioxidant used to detoxify your entire body.
[02:51:22.724 --> 02:51:26.726]  It stops free radicals, keeps cells young, and reduces inflammation.
[02:51:26.726 --> 02:51:31.008]  One World Way protein powder may be able to raise your glutathione production by 64% or more.
[02:51:32.509 --> 02:51:39.751]  One World Whey is more effective than any other whey protein powder on the market because it is unheated and from grass-fed cows.
[02:51:39.751 --> 02:51:46.194]  All other, quote, cold-processed whey protein powders have been heated and damaged by 15% or more.

[02:52:00.987 --> 02:52:06.388]  You've heard Alex Jones talk about eFoods Direct and their highly nutritious, long-term, storable food.
[02:52:06.388 --> 02:52:07.869]  Believe me, it tastes great.

[02:52:12.270 --> 02:52:14.950]  Let's say you order three of their one-week responder kits.
[02:52:14.950 --> 02:52:16.491]  You'll get the fourth week free.
[02:52:16.491 --> 02:52:19.691]  That's a $75 savings and a one-month supply.
[02:52:19.691 --> 02:52:20.812]  Are you kidding me?
[02:52:20.812 --> 02:52:26.853]  For the cost of one greasy, fast-food, supersized combo lunch, you can eat three hearty, delicious meals.
[02:52:27.313 --> 02:52:30.655]  And this offer is good for any of their quick fix supplies.

[02:53:00.613 --> 02:53:04.695]  Did you know that billions are spent every year just for a simple drink of water?
[02:53:04.695 --> 02:53:14.721]  But it's the quality of the water that Americans are concerned with, especially after floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, and other disasters that routinely disrupt and contaminate water supplies.
[02:53:14.721 --> 02:53:17.183]  Safe drinking water is too important to leave to chance.
[02:53:17.483 --> 02:53:20.966]  That's why you need an AquaRain water filtration system.
[02:53:20.966 --> 02:53:26.290]  The American-made AquaRain is an essential survival tool that operates for just pennies per gallon.
[02:53:26.290 --> 02:53:32.876]  It lets you retrieve water from lakes, ponds, streams, or rooftops during any disaster and assures you of healthy drinking water.
[02:53:32.876 --> 02:53:40.362]  The stainless steel AquaRain's patented space-age ceramic and GAC technology uses microfiltration and gravity to purify water.
[02:53:40.362 --> 02:53:43.165]  No chemicals, no electricity, no water pressure needed.
[02:53:43.165 --> 02:53:45.887]  And AquaRain's cartridges last for thousands of gallons.
[02:53:46.207 --> 02:53:49.331]  Aquarain is hands down the best water filter on the market.
[02:53:49.331 --> 02:53:50.693]  Call 800-572-2051 or go to aquarain.com.
[02:53:50.693 --> 02:53:51.695]  That's 800-572-2051 or aquarain.com.
[02:53:51.695 --> 02:53:52.836]  Every family needs an Aquarain!
[02:54:01.309 --> 02:54:02.010]  Okay.
[02:54:02.010 --> 02:54:03.332]  Two big reports.
[02:54:03.332 --> 02:54:05.254]  This is a big deal, folks.
[02:54:16.189 --> 02:54:23.292]  We're going to have a global call to confront the actual criminals, not their puppet capitals in Europe, over the austerity.
[02:54:23.292 --> 02:54:27.414]  The lion's share of the European tax money and our tax money is going to these criminals.
[02:54:27.414 --> 02:54:30.355]  These are the engineers of our pain.
[02:54:30.355 --> 02:54:31.656]  And high noon in St.
[02:54:31.656 --> 02:54:33.076]  Moritz, Switzerland.
[02:54:33.076 --> 02:54:34.937]  If you're in Europe, folks, you need to be there.
[02:54:34.937 --> 02:54:35.758]  High noon.
[02:54:35.758 --> 02:54:36.298]  Get there.
[02:54:36.298 --> 02:54:38.039]  That is the protest date.
[02:54:38.039 --> 02:54:38.659]  High noon.
[02:54:38.659 --> 02:54:39.939]  Key Google search term.
[02:54:39.939 --> 02:54:41.160]  Google it right now.
[02:54:41.160 --> 02:54:42.220]  Put it in over and over again.
[02:54:42.220 --> 02:54:42.901]  A Google bomb.
[02:54:43.581 --> 02:54:44.983]  Builderberg protest.
[02:54:44.983 --> 02:54:46.746]  And then you can reverse it and search it.
[02:54:46.746 --> 02:54:48.268]  Protest Bilderberg.
[02:54:48.268 --> 02:54:54.096]  And that will lead them to the protest article that Steve Watson will soon get up at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:54:54.096 --> 02:54:56.820]  I cannot stress to you how important this is.
[02:54:56.820 --> 02:54:59.804]  And soon, Kurt Nimmo will have his exclusive report.
[02:55:00.717 --> 02:55:12.746]  This is breaking here with more details than we've even given so far on the first portion of the agenda that we've gotten from a man who 100% has the intel.
[02:55:12.746 --> 02:55:14.888]  So this is huge.
[02:55:14.888 --> 02:55:16.229]  Going back to Aaron Dykes.
[02:55:16.229 --> 02:55:18.070]  Aaron, other points.
[02:55:18.070 --> 02:55:27.578]  I mean, this looks like more security though with cameras and a tarp to block the cars and all of this and floodlights than we've seen at previous events.
[02:55:28.730 --> 02:55:29.050]  Right.
[02:55:29.050 --> 02:55:39.313]  Take, for instance, Canada, where they used the backdoor ramp drop so they could hide a lot of their high-profile people, including Hillary Clinton.
[02:55:39.313 --> 02:55:47.635]  This year, they have the entrance checkpoint where they do the key validation, making sure the people are on the list, and they put up a barrier wall
[02:55:48.416 --> 02:55:53.322]  Uh, you know, keeping down the visibility so you can identify or easily take pictures.
[02:55:53.322 --> 02:55:59.892]  Then they've got roughly 150 yards, maybe even 200 yards to the main entrance.
[02:55:59.892 --> 02:56:05.219]  So it's quite receded, it's covered in trees, and they've really made it a challenge to photograph.
[02:56:05.399 --> 02:56:09.701]  And this is our government representatives violating the Logan Act.
[02:56:09.701 --> 02:56:14.042]  Hillary was fined, what was it, $300,000 for this back in the mid-90s.
[02:56:14.042 --> 02:56:19.264]  Going and meeting and hiding, and then lying and being caught, not wanting the media to cover it.
[02:56:19.264 --> 02:56:22.865]  But usually, it's only the alternative media covers it anyways.
[02:56:22.865 --> 02:56:24.086]  But I'm looking at these photos.
[02:56:24.086 --> 02:56:30.568]  You can get down the road with the Zoom camera, zoom in, and still get shots of them at that checkpoint.
[02:56:30.568 --> 02:56:31.609]  There's more than one way to...
[02:56:32.634 --> 02:56:36.977]  Skin a cat in the Infowar and we're going to get these videos.
[02:56:36.977 --> 02:56:43.462]  They'll undoubtedly also be toddling around in the resort below and so you know what to do there.
[02:56:43.462 --> 02:56:47.465]  We're going to get the video and identify these criminals and their activities.
[02:56:47.465 --> 02:56:47.766]  Aaron?
[02:56:49.907 --> 02:56:51.508]  Yeah, and they know we're watching them.
[02:56:51.508 --> 02:56:59.313]  I mean, the protesters that are here now are very visible, and if we get a lot more numbers, the message will clearly be sent.
[02:56:59.313 --> 02:57:05.958]  For those that do come to the Village, it's quite small, so you will be seen, you will be heard.
[02:57:05.958 --> 02:57:08.459]  I would imagine there's a lot of places to stay.
[02:57:08.459 --> 02:57:12.322]  Of course, a few places have closed down because it's off-season from the ski resort.
[02:57:13.082 --> 02:57:17.283]  Uh, but there should be room to come on down, and you can literally see it.
[02:57:17.283 --> 02:57:23.965]  It's kind of up on the hill, the Master Hotel overlooking the lake that's part of the mountains here in St.
[02:57:23.965 --> 02:57:25.266]  Moritz.
[02:57:25.266 --> 02:57:31.848]  And so if they do leave the hotel, I would imagine they too will be easily seen, and I think it would be hard for them to hide, Alex.
[02:57:32.858 --> 02:57:35.480]  Well Aaron, I am calling on everybody.
[02:57:35.480 --> 02:57:37.081]  We need to make this big.
[02:57:37.081 --> 02:57:55.775]  We need the people of Europe and the world are being robbed by these folks to actually go confront the people that are buying and selling our politicians and also everyone should pick newspapers and TV in Switzerland to call but also international media and demand they cover it.
[02:57:55.775 --> 02:57:56.175]  If you had 125 top
[02:57:58.484 --> 02:57:58.944]  I don't know.
[02:58:21.104 --> 02:58:22.705]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:22.705 --> 02:58:23.365]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.138 --> 02:58:55.681]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:58:55.681 --> 02:58:56.601]  Number one.
[02:58:56.601 --> 02:59:00.024]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:59:00.024 --> 02:59:00.884]  Number two.
[02:59:00.884 --> 02:59:05.767]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:59:05.767 --> 02:59:06.528]  It's true.
[02:59:06.528 --> 02:59:11.391]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:59:11.391 --> 02:59:12.211]  Number three.
[02:59:12.211 --> 02:59:15.814]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:59:15.814 --> 02:59:19.496]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:59:19.696 --> 02:59:20.497]  Number 4.
[02:59:20.497 --> 02:59:23.259]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:59:23.259 --> 02:59:26.943]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:59:26.943 --> 02:59:27.744]  Number 5.
[02:59:27.744 --> 02:59:31.887]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:59:31.887 --> 02:59:36.652]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:59:36.932 --> 02:59:41.095]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:41.095 --> 02:59:42.896]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:42.896 --> 02:59:45.138]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:59:45.138 --> 02:59:47.740]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:59:47.740 --> 02:59:53.564]  Coast to Coast.
[02:59:53.564 --> 02:59:55.606]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.606 --> 02:59:58.828]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:18.882 --> 03:00:22.006]  Well, incredible coverage of the Global Crime Syndicate meeting in St.
[03:00:22.006 --> 03:00:23.028]  Moritz, Switzerland.
[03:00:23.028 --> 03:00:26.392]  We're now into internet-only overdrive.
[03:00:26.392 --> 03:00:27.434]  Well, we're on the satellite.
[03:00:27.434 --> 03:00:30.038]  Stations can pick this up if they want.
[03:00:30.038 --> 03:00:31.319]  We're talking to Paul Watson.
[03:00:31.319 --> 03:00:34.063]  We're talking to Aaron Dykes.
[03:00:34.864 --> 03:00:40.888]  And we've got two big reports of the big announcement of the global protest to convene Saturday at high noon in St.
[03:00:40.888 --> 03:00:48.374]  Moritz, Switzerland, and big chunks of the super secret Bilderberg agenda from the mole we've got through Tucker and others.
[03:00:48.374 --> 03:00:54.338]  And a lot of what Tucker's now said is also confirmed by a Swiss newspaper that a lot of big decisions are being made, as we knew.
[03:00:54.338 --> 03:00:56.139]  This is huge news.
[03:00:56.139 --> 03:00:58.081]  So that's all coming out very, very soon.
[03:00:58.081 --> 03:01:01.743]  I'll keep doing overdrive until I get the info and can cover it here.
[03:01:01.743 --> 03:01:02.264]  But gentlemen,
[03:01:03.084 --> 03:01:05.946]  Paul Watson, so much to talk about.
[03:01:05.946 --> 03:01:09.768]  As soon as you hang up the phone, you're going to remember some issues you forgot to cover.
[03:01:09.768 --> 03:01:14.250]  What else is important that people need to know about what's happening?
[03:01:14.250 --> 03:01:22.815]  Well, Alex, there was a kind of a red herring put out because everybody said that it was going to be at the Hotel Pinsky.
[03:01:22.815 --> 03:01:24.696]  When we drove into town, into St.
[03:01:24.696 --> 03:01:27.798]  Moritz, we drove directly past this hotel.
[03:01:27.798 --> 03:01:30.920]  In fact, you can see it on this hotel window as well.
[03:01:31.680 --> 03:01:33.022]  It was all shut down.
[03:01:33.022 --> 03:01:33.984]  There was nobody there.
[03:01:33.984 --> 03:01:43.016]  And that's what started the rumour in the first place because people had tried to book rooms there for days during this Bilderberg conference.
[03:01:43.016 --> 03:01:47.101]  And that was the kind of tearing, but they're actually way up on the hill.
[03:01:47.942 --> 03:01:48.823]  Any other points, Paul?
[03:02:13.947 --> 03:02:20.609]  No, Tucker said about the Libya thing, they're terrified of Congress stopping the bombing of Libya.
[03:02:20.609 --> 03:02:25.091]  They want a gigantic war in the Middle East, which is the same as what they said last year.
[03:02:25.091 --> 03:02:30.893]  Of course, we know they're still concerned about the Greek debt situation and the euro.
[03:02:30.893 --> 03:02:31.153]  We had
[03:02:31.973 --> 03:02:52.638]  Builderberg and Kenneth Rogoff come out and say that if the Greek debt situation is allowed to spiral into crisis and if Greece defaults on its debt, then that could place in peril the Euro and in turn the global currency, the regionalised currency that the elite seek to implement.
[03:02:52.638 --> 03:02:58.960]  So they're still very much concerned about the collapse of the Euro and the break-up of the European Union.
[03:03:00.121 --> 03:03:15.853]  The newspaper, one of the newspapers we purchased this afternoon talks about a Swiss energy minister attending the conference which is interesting because Switzerland has just agreed to decommission all its nuclear power plants by 2034 and this lady
[03:03:19.236 --> 03:03:30.881]  Luther is a Swiss, Doris Luthard, she's the Swiss Energy Minister, and she's been summoned to Bilderberg, and that's on the front page of the under-tagged black newspaper.
[03:03:30.881 --> 03:03:42.705]  So, Bilderberg are obviously very concerned about the fact that their agenda with nuclear power could be coming to an end in the aftermath of Fukushima, so they've summoned this energy minister.
[03:03:42.845 --> 03:03:47.030]  Well, how shameful is it that there's no coverage in the U.S.
[03:03:47.030 --> 03:03:50.213]  media except for the Drudge Report linking to us on Monday?
[03:03:50.213 --> 03:04:03.708]  I know Drudge is waiting for our big reports with the inside intel, but those will be out soon, so hopefully he'll help us break the electronic blockade, the no-information zone they've tried to set up here in the United States.
[03:04:04.469 --> 03:04:06.314]  And so I'm Princess Leia Drudge.
[03:04:06.314 --> 03:04:07.657]  Help me, Obi-Wan Drudge.
[03:04:07.657 --> 03:04:08.799]  You're our only hope.
[03:04:08.799 --> 03:04:10.664]  Now, folks all over the world are listening.
[03:04:10.664 --> 03:04:14.352]  How exciting do you think this idea for the mass protest on Saturday is, Paul?
[03:04:16.186 --> 03:04:19.907]  Well, it's big because, to be frank, there's not enough people there at the moment.
[03:04:19.907 --> 03:04:23.969]  I mean, the conference hasn't actually started yet.
[03:04:23.969 --> 03:04:28.751]  There were reports of a few members arriving, but we didn't see much evidence of that.
[03:04:28.751 --> 03:04:32.893]  There were, you know, the black cars in evidence, but there were no passengers.
[03:04:32.893 --> 03:04:38.195]  So this thing hasn't even begun to kick off, so that's why people need to get down there, and they've still got time to do so.
[03:04:38.935 --> 03:04:39.556]  Absolutely.
[03:04:39.556 --> 03:04:44.961]  We've got videos and audio being linked at our Twitter account, twitter.com forward slash Real Alex Jones.
[03:04:44.961 --> 03:04:46.422]  Please retweet everything.
[03:04:46.422 --> 03:04:52.528]  We've got the big data page with the videos archived, the live streaming videos, the photos, and so much more.
[03:04:52.528 --> 03:05:00.055]  Gentlemen, let me say bye to you during the break and talk to you about future planning, and then I'll come back and cover a ton of vital news.
[03:05:00.055 --> 03:05:00.476]  Stay with us.
