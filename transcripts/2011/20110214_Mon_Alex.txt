[00:00:04.895 --> 00:00:06.217]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.217 --> 00:00:07.979]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:09.742]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.742 --> 00:00:11.324]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.324 --> 00:00:12.886]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.886 --> 00:00:17.072]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.072 --> 00:00:21.137]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.482 --> 00:00:24.203]  We're live!
[00:00:24.203 --> 00:00:28.647]  It's Monday, February 14th, 2011.
[00:00:28.647 --> 00:00:30.109]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:33.893]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson, and I'll be filling in for Alex today.
[00:00:33.893 --> 00:00:41.700]  And coming up later, we've got Aaron Dykes live in studio, and Aaron's gonna guide you through the show after I leave.
[00:00:42.361 --> 00:00:43.683]  What's going on in the world today?
[00:00:43.683 --> 00:00:53.634]  Well, revolution continues to sweep the globe as the kaleidoscope of the New World Order remains in a flux.
[00:00:53.634 --> 00:01:03.324]  But unlike Glenn Beck and the rest of the neocons who are busy wringing their hands trying to make sense of these revolutions and what they could lead to,
[00:01:04.588 --> 00:01:12.251]  We have of course Tunisia, Egypt and now Algeria experiencing similar unrest.
[00:01:12.251 --> 00:01:22.976]  But unlike Glenn Beck, we're going to tell you who's really behind radical Islam and why it's being used as a weapon against people of every colour and creed.
[00:01:22.976 --> 00:01:24.277]  We're also going to explain
[00:01:25.237 --> 00:01:33.725]  Why Ron Paul should feel honoured to have been kicked out of the Young Americans for Freedom organisation.
[00:01:33.725 --> 00:01:37.569]  We've also got the move towards global currency heating up.
[00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:40.192]  The global revolution that's sweeping the planet.
[00:01:40.192 --> 00:01:42.994]  It's all coming up in today's show.
[00:01:42.994 --> 00:01:44.316]  But first to Egypt.
[00:01:44.796 --> 00:01:53.381]  Where the military has taken control of the country, of course, after President Hosni Mubarak's resignation on Friday.
[00:01:53.381 --> 00:02:02.786]  Reports out of the Jerusalem Post now suggest that Mubarak is in a coma, having collapsed following his speech on Friday.
[00:02:02.786 --> 00:02:07.048]  That's yet to be confirmed, but strange reports coming out about that.
[00:02:07.048 --> 00:02:07.489]  And of course,
[00:02:08.615 --> 00:02:21.482]  Today the military has announced that it has suspended the Egyptian constitution, is banning strikes, and it's telling the Egyptian protesters to leave Tihya Square.
[00:02:21.482 --> 00:02:24.104]  Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.
[00:02:25.017 --> 00:02:39.346]  And of course, as we've explained in depth on the Alex Jones Show, the global elite have several pawns on standby, ready to assume power and hijack the people's revolution that has unfolded there in Egypt.
[00:02:39.346 --> 00:02:46.591]  Of course, ElBaradei, chief amongst them, they have several others waiting to sweep in and hijack the revolution.
[00:02:48.923 --> 00:02:53.409]  Egypt's new military regime to effectively outlaw strikes.
[00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:55.212]  This is out of Reuters.
[00:02:55.212 --> 00:02:56.033]  Cairo.
[00:02:56.033 --> 00:03:03.342]  Egypt's new military rulers will issue a warning on Monday against anyone who creates, quote, chaos and disorder.
[00:03:03.342 --> 00:03:03.703]  An army
[00:03:03.763 --> 00:03:19.614]  The source said the higher military council will also ban meetings by labor unions or professional syndicates effectively forbidding strikes and tell all Egyptians to get back to work after the unrest that toppled Hosni Mubarak.
[00:03:19.614 --> 00:03:28.621]  So the higher military council is on the one hand saying they will allow protests and yet on the other telling all the protesters to go home.
[00:03:30.874 --> 00:03:42.145]  So we've got a situation whereby, you know, they've turfed out the 30-year dictator Mubarak and now they've basically got a military dictatorship in his place.
[00:03:42.145 --> 00:03:54.597]  Obviously they say it's gonna be temporary, we're talking about six months until the election, but they're gonna have a raft of New World Order approved candidates to take Mubarak's place.
[00:03:55.953 --> 00:04:13.624]  Now that's not to belittle the legitimate grievances of the Egyptian people, which we've explained at length here on the Alex Jones Show, and it's not to downplay the victory that they indeed have had in getting rid of Mubarak, the 30-year unelected dictator.
[00:04:15.543 --> 00:04:18.707]  The fact is Egyptians were living on $2 a day.
[00:04:18.707 --> 00:04:22.531]  They were spending 40% of their income on food.
[00:04:22.531 --> 00:04:30.520]  Food prices skyrocketed and that was one of the straws that broke the camel's back as well, of course, as soaring unemployment.
[00:04:31.701 --> 00:04:48.780]  So to say that this was a completely staged and contrived colour revolution from the very beginning is a kind of disservice to the more nuanced reality of the situation, which we will explore in further detail after the break on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:49.961]  So stay tuned.
[00:04:49.961 --> 00:04:51.983]  It's PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:04:51.983 --> 00:04:52.544]  Don't go away.
[00:05:00.205 --> 00:05:04.367]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:05:04.367 --> 00:05:10.791]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:05:10.791 --> 00:05:18.175]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:05:18.175 --> 00:05:22.718]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[00:05:23.038 --> 00:05:31.706]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:35.969]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:42.135]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:05:42.735 --> 00:05:46.621]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:05:46.621 --> 00:05:54.051]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[00:05:54.051 --> 00:05:54.512]  Thank you!
[00:06:00.796 --> 00:06:16.264]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:06:16.264 --> 00:06:19.946]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:06:20.956 --> 00:06:33.728]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:06:33.728 --> 00:06:40.995]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:06:41.676 --> 00:06:52.048]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:06:52.048 --> 00:06:55.992]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:06:55.992 --> 00:06:59.095]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[00:06:59.716 --> 00:07:04.260]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:05.181]  Number 1.
[00:07:05.181 --> 00:07:08.604]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:07:08.604 --> 00:07:09.464]  Number 2.
[00:07:09.464 --> 00:07:14.368]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:07:14.368 --> 00:07:15.109]  It's true.
[00:07:15.109 --> 00:07:19.973]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:07:19.973 --> 00:07:20.814]  Number 3.
[00:07:20.814 --> 00:07:24.397]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:07:24.397 --> 00:07:28.100]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.081]  Number 4.
[00:07:29.081 --> 00:07:31.844]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:07:31.844 --> 00:07:35.528]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:07:35.528 --> 00:07:36.328]  Number 5.
[00:07:36.328 --> 00:07:40.473]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:07:40.473 --> 00:07:45.218]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:07:45.518 --> 00:07:49.682]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:49.682 --> 00:07:51.464]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:51.464 --> 00:07:53.726]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[00:08:05.066 --> 00:08:09.887]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:08:09.887 --> 00:08:11.468]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.468 --> 00:08:13.008]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.008 --> 00:08:17.209]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.209 --> 00:08:22.450]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:32.773]  It's Paul Joseph Watson sitting in for Alex Jones on this live broadcast, and we're talking about the revolution, of course, there in Egypt.
[00:08:34.028 --> 00:08:52.857]  Now, this uprising could not have occurred, of course, without the causative factors of unemployment and soaring food costs, but that doesn't mean for a second that the globalists weren't prepared from the outset to hijack this revolution and turn it towards their own ends.
[00:08:52.857 --> 00:08:53.598]  Indeed, we know
[00:08:54.298 --> 00:08:55.059]  That the U.S.
[00:08:55.059 --> 00:09:06.332]  Embassy as early as December 2008 had its informants telling them that there was unrest which would most likely lead to a revolution in Egypt in the year 2011.
[00:09:06.332 --> 00:09:10.397]  They put it down exactly to the precise year.
[00:09:10.837 --> 00:09:25.388]  Similarly in Tunisia with the Ben Ali regime, as far back as 2006 the CIA were given the indication that an overthrow was possible over the next few years and that's exactly what happened.
[00:09:26.693 --> 00:09:34.678]  So, we saw this play out when it was first on the news in Egypt for about a week.
[00:09:34.678 --> 00:09:47.726]  And while this happened, the Pied Pipers of the Neocon slash Tea Party movement, the hijacked Republican distortion of it that is, for about a week they had no idea how to fit
[00:09:48.506 --> 00:09:55.989]  The scenes we were seeing out of Egypt into their manipulative left-right paradigm.
[00:09:55.989 --> 00:10:10.076]  Indeed, one of the first things that happened when the riots started in Egypt was for Vice President Joe Biden to come out and basically lend his support to Mubarak, the sitting dictator.
[00:10:10.076 --> 00:10:14.778]  And that gave the indication that the Obama administration was against the protesters.
[00:10:16.718 --> 00:10:23.561]  So the neocons didn't know, you know, on which side to come down on this.
[00:10:23.561 --> 00:10:28.862]  The Obama administration was seemingly, you know, pro-Mubarak and against the protesters.
[00:10:28.862 --> 00:10:38.806]  But to praise the sight of thousands of rioting Muslims, 90% of Egyptians are Muslims, just didn't sit comfortably
[00:10:40.444 --> 00:10:53.188]  With people who are trying to sell this idea of a clash of civilizations, which people like Glenn Beck and the rest of the neocon talk show hosts are.
[00:10:53.188 --> 00:10:54.589]  And while they're trying to sell this...
[00:10:56.175 --> 00:11:13.000]  They're simultaneously ignoring the glaringly obvious fact, the manifestly provable fact, that radical Islam, which they now fear will take over Egypt, is a creature of the US military-industrial complex.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:23.323]  Not only from its inception, with the creation of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Wahhabi Muslims in Egypt, and also Al-Qaeda, to fight the Soviets in 79,
[00:11:25.024 --> 00:11:27.097]  But continuing to the present day...
[00:11:28.559 --> 00:11:51.404]  So, we put out an article on Saturday which talked about this, and we're going to have Aaron on the show later today to discuss it in greater depth, but Glenn Beck and I caught his show on Friday, and this is not about an obsession with Glenn Beck, they're all saying it, this is the tax that they've taken, this is the line that they've followed in the aftermath of this revolution.
[00:11:51.404 --> 00:11:56.966]  Glenn Beck, certainly on his Friday radio show and television show,
[00:11:58.763 --> 00:12:15.050]  is busy saying that the aftermath of the revolution in Egypt will allow the Muslim Brotherhood to basically unite with global communism and global anarchism to advance the New World Order.
[00:12:18.482 --> 00:12:36.716]  Glenn Beck has no idea that radical Islam in and of itself was created by the New World Order, or the US military industrial complex if you prefer, and continues to be fostered and fomented, provoked, financed and funded by those same very forces.
[00:12:36.716 --> 00:12:45.522]  So Beck is saying that it's a huge Muslim Brotherhood Communist conspiracy which threatens the West without telling you that
[00:12:46.516 --> 00:12:54.759]  The radical Islamic threat is a mere tool, a mere creation of the globalists that's going to be used as a weapon against us all.
[00:12:54.759 --> 00:13:15.687]  What Glenn Beck won't tell you is the fact that the Islamic Wahhabi in Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood that's now going to have a big say in these elections in six months, established an alliance with and was heavily funded by the CIA at the same time that the CIA began its relationship with one Osama Bin Laden.
[00:13:17.421 --> 00:13:26.529]  Now Beck is always on about how Islamic fundamentalism is being indoctrinated into the younger generation around the world.
[00:13:26.529 --> 00:13:41.603]  Those very doctrination centres for radical Islam were set up at the same time with the aid of the Wahhabi Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, again by the CIA, at the same time that they were financing Bin Laden.
[00:13:43.908 --> 00:13:55.400]  It's a matter of historical fact and yet Glenn Beck never is able to put his finger on the pulse about who is truly behind this so-called Islamic threat.
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.302]  Which is not to say that it isn't a threat.
[00:13:57.302 --> 00:14:03.628]  Of course it's a threat because it's heavily financed by the US military-industrial complex.
[00:14:03.628 --> 00:14:07.052]  Which, you know, is not an insufficient ally to have.
[00:14:08.757 --> 00:14:25.625]  So Beck spends his entire Friday show basically, and his TV show, spinning connections between fundamentalist Muslims, communist anarchists, while never mentioning once the fact that Islamic fundamentalism and the threat of radical Islam
[00:14:26.724 --> 00:14:41.631]  And of course its immediate expression, terrorism, was not only founded by the CIA but continues to be contrived, provoked, financed and funded by the US military-industrial complex to this day.
[00:14:41.631 --> 00:14:52.096]  And again, Beck's right to make the assertion that radical Islam is a threat, but that's because it's been so heavily supported by the US military-industrial complex, which is the crucial part.
[00:14:53.224 --> 00:15:04.035]  Beck is claiming that the New World Order is a combination of radical Islam, communists and anarchists, you know, people like Van Jones and the rest of them.
[00:15:04.035 --> 00:15:12.743]  When in reality, all of these groups are merely tools that have been manipulated by the New World Order, which is above them all and controls them all.
[00:15:13.635 --> 00:15:14.935]  And how do I know this?
[00:15:14.935 --> 00:15:28.199]  Because every single major terror plot that has been blamed on radical Islam, specifically in the United States, has been contrived by the US military-industrial complex.
[00:15:28.199 --> 00:15:36.841]  And my article this morning on PrisonPlanet.com, and it's still the top story, proves this case-by-case.
[00:15:36.841 --> 00:15:41.042]  Terrorists who trained London bombers was working for US government.
[00:15:42.455 --> 00:16:03.762]  And this is a London Guardian report about Mohammed Junaid Babar, who set up the terrorist training camp in Pakistan in 2003, at which the alleged ringleader of the 7-7 bombings in London, Mohammed Siddiq Khan, learned his bomb-making techniques.
[00:16:05.876 --> 00:16:27.724]  And now a New York judge, after this Babar character admitted to five counts of terrorism, including aiding the ringleader of the London bombings, a New York judge reduced his 70-year sentence to less than five years and he's now free!
[00:16:27.724 --> 00:16:31.166]  Graham Fowkes, a magistrate whose 22-year-old son was
[00:16:32.113 --> 00:16:38.976]  Whose 22-year-old son David was killed by con at the Edgeware Road underground station in 2005.
[00:16:38.976 --> 00:16:42.017]  He was a victim of the bombings.
[00:16:42.017 --> 00:16:45.058]  Said, quote, people get four and a half years for burglary.
[00:16:45.058 --> 00:16:48.159]  They can get more for some road traffic offences.
[00:16:48.159 --> 00:16:58.343]  So for an international terrorist who's directly linked to the death of my son and dozens and dozens of other people to get that sentence is just outrageous.
[00:16:59.881 --> 00:17:03.263]  So why has he been released after four and a half years?
[00:17:03.263 --> 00:17:23.377]  Well, it turns out that Mr. Mohammed Junaid Babar was working for the US government as an informant, not only after the London bombings and after his arrest in 2004, but before that when he was busy training the ringleader of 7-7 on how to make bombs.
[00:17:23.377 --> 00:17:27.080]  That's right, he was working for the US government at the same time.
[00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:30.941]  Coincidence?
[00:17:30.941 --> 00:17:31.601]  I wonder.
[00:17:31.601 --> 00:17:45.828]  And also remember the fact that Haroun Rashid Aswad, who was the so-called mastermind behind the bombers, was a British intelligence asset, as revealed by terrorist expert John Loftus.
[00:17:47.062 --> 00:17:56.830]  Who pointed out that Aswat was part of the Kosovo group that was being financed and controlled by the CIA back in the mid-90s.
[00:17:56.830 --> 00:18:11.623]  So he was another client of the Central Intelligence Agency, just as it appears that Mohammed Junaid Babar was, prior to the London bombings when he was training the lead bomber, the alleged lead bomber,
[00:18:13.137 --> 00:18:14.718]  To cook the bomb.
[00:18:14.718 --> 00:18:18.882]  He was working for the US government at the same time.
[00:18:18.882 --> 00:18:23.225]  Again, the radical Islamic threat.
[00:18:23.225 --> 00:18:24.706]  Whose fingerprints are on it?
[00:18:24.706 --> 00:18:27.789]  9-11.
[00:18:27.789 --> 00:18:32.513]  Able Danger Program identified the hijackers long before 9-11.
[00:18:32.513 --> 00:18:38.277]  Then you had, of course, Colonel Anthony Schaeffer who tried to tell the 9-11 commissioner about this evidence.
[00:18:38.277 --> 00:18:40.059]  He was gagged, slandered and ignored.
[00:18:42.281 --> 00:18:49.364]  The man who trained six of the 9-11 hijackers, Louis Alsaka, CIA informant.
[00:18:49.364 --> 00:18:53.106]  Many of the other hijackers trained at US airbases.
[00:18:53.106 --> 00:19:03.110]  Two of the hijackers, Khalid Almidar and Naif Alzami, renting rooms in a house owned and lived in by an FBI informant.
[00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:07.592]  Newsweek in 2002 reported, the hijackers we let escape.
[00:19:09.482 --> 00:19:22.159]  Documented how, quote, the CIA tracked two suspected terrorists to an Al-Qaeda summit in Malaysia in January 2000, then looked on as they re-entered America and began preparations for September 11th.
[00:19:22.159 --> 00:19:26.445]  And of course you had the spiritual leader, the granddaddy,
[00:19:28.484 --> 00:19:43.294]  Of the 9-11 hijackers, specifically ones that allegedly slammed Flight 77 into the Pentagon, Anwar al-Awlaki, who himself was invited to dine with Pentagon top brass months after the attack.
[00:19:43.294 --> 00:19:49.538]  In every single case, radical Islam is a contrivance of the US military-industrial complex.
[00:19:49.538 --> 00:19:51.760]  Glenn Beck won't tell you about it, though.
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:55.522]  We'll be right back with more on the Alex Jones Show after this break.
[00:19:55.522 --> 00:19:57.323]  Stay tuned to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:20:00.419 --> 00:20:02.180]  Normal blood pressure, naturally.
[00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:03.521]  How would that make you feel?
[00:20:03.521 --> 00:20:05.221]  I'm Don from New Mexico.
[00:20:05.221 --> 00:20:07.783]  January of 2000, I had a heart attack.
[00:20:07.783 --> 00:20:15.327]  Then my real health began going downhill, and I had high blood pressure, high blood sugar, poor vision, and I really wasn't sleeping well.
[00:20:15.327 --> 00:20:16.827]  I was a mess, pretty much.
[00:20:16.827 --> 00:20:19.589]  Don reports dramatic improvements with heart and body extract.
[00:20:19.589 --> 00:20:24.891]  I started taking heart and body extract, and from within a few days, I started sleeping a lot better.
[00:20:24.891 --> 00:20:29.954]  My blood pressure normalized, my blood sugar normalized, and my sleep really did improve.
[00:20:30.114 --> 00:20:35.216]  Experience these benefits and more when your body gets what it needs with the assistance of Heart and Body Extract.
[00:20:35.216 --> 00:20:39.638]  Order at hbextract.com or call 866-295-5305.
[00:20:39.638 --> 00:20:44.921]  That's hbextract.com or call 866-295-5305.
[00:20:44.921 --> 00:20:47.722]  Folks, I did not expect this at all.
[00:20:47.722 --> 00:20:52.424]  By the 7th, 8th, and 9th day, I saw dramatic improvements from taking Heart and Body Extract.
[00:20:52.424 --> 00:20:56.266]  Details at hbextract.com or call 866-295-5305 for Heart and Body Extract.
[00:21:00.996 --> 00:21:05.020]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:08.263]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:21:08.263 --> 00:21:13.067]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:21:13.067 --> 00:21:19.453]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:21:19.453 --> 00:21:21.696]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:21:22.276 --> 00:21:24.638]  As American citizens to pay attention.
[00:21:24.638 --> 00:21:27.960]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:34.745]  A criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:21:34.745 --> 00:21:37.106]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:21:37.106 --> 00:21:38.687]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:21:38.687 --> 00:21:40.889]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:21:41.129 --> 00:21:48.413]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:21:48.413 --> 00:21:57.518]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:21:59.238 --> 00:22:05.901]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:22:05.901 --> 00:22:14.024]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:22:14.024 --> 00:22:21.848]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:22:22.188 --> 00:22:27.272]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:22:27.272 --> 00:22:32.496]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:22:32.496 --> 00:22:36.840]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:37.941]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:37.941 --> 00:22:41.964]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:50.333]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[00:22:52.075 --> 00:22:52.335]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:00.276 --> 00:23:02.837]  It's a new year full of uncertainties.
[00:23:02.837 --> 00:23:05.919]  People are being laid off in record numbers.
[00:23:05.919 --> 00:23:10.861]  The price of food continues to rise, and the economy continues to falter.
[00:23:10.861 --> 00:23:15.963]  You know that you need to prepare, and maybe you've been putting it off, but the time to act is now.
[00:23:16.343 --> 00:23:19.664]  That's why you need to visit OrganicaSeed.com.

[00:23:55.998 --> 00:23:57.699]  OrganicaSeed.com today!
[00:24:24.636 --> 00:24:29.020]  We're back on the Alex Jones Show today, Monday February 14th.
[00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:34.664]  Aaron Dykes will be joining us in around 30 minutes time.
[00:24:34.664 --> 00:24:40.729]  We're talking about terrorists who trained London bombers was working for US government.
[00:24:40.729 --> 00:24:53.400]  Now while people like Glenn Beck will try and tie together radical Islam and global communism and global anarchism and say that that's the real threat, they will uniformly fail to point out the fact that
[00:24:53.860 --> 00:25:00.510]  Radical Islamic fundamentalism is a complete contrivance of the US military-industrial complex.
[00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:04.857]  Not once will Glenn Beck dare to mention that fact.
[00:25:04.857 --> 00:25:07.882]  We've talked about it in relation to 9-11 before the break.
[00:25:09.284 --> 00:25:34.872]  And in fact on PrisonPlanet.com, in our top featured story at the moment, we break down a myriad of examples where every single major terror plot in the United States has been contrived by the FBI, by the CIA, through their network of Arab-Muslim double agent patsies who handle the would-be terrorists, radicalize them.
[00:25:35.672 --> 00:25:50.158]  And then create the threat, which gives them the justification to create giant federal government slush funds from which they get these public-private partnerships which make plenty of dollars for everyone concerned.
[00:25:50.158 --> 00:25:53.319]  See something, say something being one of them.
[00:25:53.319 --> 00:25:56.080]  Naked body scanners being another.
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:26:00.202]  And on that very subject, the underwear bomber, of course,
[00:26:01.494 --> 00:26:13.901]  Again, Al Alake, the CIA lackey, was meeting with Pentagon top brass months after 9-11, having been the spiritual leader of the alleged hijackers.
[00:26:13.901 --> 00:26:16.363]  He was involved in directing the underwear bomber.
[00:26:17.143 --> 00:26:20.924]  Um, who was of course allowed to board the plane by order of the U.S.
[00:26:20.924 --> 00:26:22.004]  State Department.
[00:26:22.004 --> 00:26:24.385]  That was in the Detroit News.
[00:26:24.385 --> 00:26:30.346]  Aided by a well-dressed man, he was the, uh, CIA agent allowing him to get on the plane.
[00:26:30.346 --> 00:26:38.168]  Uh, and of course, the underwear bomber himself, he was on a terror watch list, he had no passport, he had no business being on a plane.
[00:26:38.168 --> 00:26:42.189]  And in fact, eyewitnesses who observed the
[00:26:43.229 --> 00:26:46.190]  Fizzle, as the bomb was about to go off.
[00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:49.390]  Of course, it was aborted, it didn't go off.
[00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:57.772]  Noted Abdul-Mulatab's behaviour, the underwear bomber, as being completely inconsistent with somebody who knew what they were doing.
[00:26:57.772 --> 00:27:00.132]  He was completely taken unawares by it.
[00:27:00.132 --> 00:27:02.892]  He was the classic patsy.
[00:27:02.892 --> 00:27:09.734]  And of course, Delta 253 passenger Kurt Haskell has routinely appeared on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:27:09.734 --> 00:27:10.694]  He was on the plane.
[00:27:11.994 --> 00:27:30.588]  And now he boldly and publicly states that everything he witnessed points to the fact that this was a staged event by the US government to create the pretext for the implementation of naked body scanners, which of course came through immediately after the December 2009 staged event.
[00:27:33.191 --> 00:27:46.261]  And of course made a whole bundle of money for Asser and Mr Chertoff and many others connected with Homeland Security and these public-private partnerships which continue today.
[00:27:46.261 --> 00:27:52.026]  So another example where the Feds contrive the Islamic threat.
[00:27:52.026 --> 00:27:53.047]  Here's another for you.
[00:27:53.047 --> 00:27:56.770]  Fort Hood shooting Major Nidal Malik Hassan.
[00:27:57.967 --> 00:28:10.535]  The FBI knew that he was communicating with alleged Al-Qaeda leaders, again one of them was al-Awlaki, the CIA lackey, for nearly a year before the Fort Hood shootings.
[00:28:10.535 --> 00:28:20.602]  They didn't seem to be too concerned about telling the army base that he was communicating with these so-called Al-Qaeda terrorists and while he was still on the army base.
[00:28:20.602 --> 00:28:26.886]  Indeed, Hassan was being invited to homeland security exercises at the same time!
[00:28:29.454 --> 00:28:37.399]  So they knew that Fort Hood was coming, they knew that he was being handled by these double agent Al-Qaeda people who were working for the CIA.
[00:28:37.399 --> 00:28:39.701]  Again, the attack went ahead.
[00:28:39.701 --> 00:28:49.547]  The radical Islamic threat was blamed, but the true fingerprints of the culprits were never brought to light in the media.
[00:28:49.547 --> 00:28:55.350]  Fort Dix, the 2007 plot to, quote, kill as many soldiers as possible.
[00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:55.611]  Again.
[00:28:56.904 --> 00:29:03.568]  The investigation concluded that, quote, FBI informants were the key figures behind the operation.
[00:29:03.568 --> 00:29:08.872]  And the six foreign-born Muslims were merely bungling patsies.
[00:29:08.872 --> 00:29:12.274]  And there's that man again, Al-Alaqi, the CIA lackey.
[00:29:12.274 --> 00:29:14.195]  He was involved in grooming the patsies.
[00:29:14.195 --> 00:29:15.036]  He's the main man.
[00:29:15.036 --> 00:29:16.337]  He's the middle man.
[00:29:16.337 --> 00:29:18.218]  He's the go-to double agent patsy.
[00:29:20.618 --> 00:29:22.419]  And we can move to Canada.
[00:29:22.419 --> 00:29:23.380]  Toronto.
[00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:26.061]  The Toronto 18 terrorists again.
[00:29:26.061 --> 00:29:30.484]  The guy who gave them the bomb was working for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
[00:29:30.484 --> 00:29:37.629]  We'll go through more examples and we'll play a video on this so-called mythical Islamic threat that's being contrived by the Feds.
[00:29:37.629 --> 00:29:39.190]  After the break, stay tuned.
[00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:40.791]  It's the Alex Jones Show live.
[00:29:40.791 --> 00:29:43.032]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:29:43.032 --> 00:29:44.173]  Aaron and I are coming up soon.
[00:29:50.717 --> 00:29:54.647]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.647 --> 00:29:57.334]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.339 --> 00:30:04.181]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[00:30:04.181 --> 00:30:08.463]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[00:30:08.463 --> 00:30:13.365]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[00:30:13.365 --> 00:30:19.108]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[00:30:19.108 --> 00:30:22.770]  Not worried about them moving south.
[00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:26.111]  Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[00:30:29.043 --> 00:30:36.047]  We're American and be proud.
[00:30:36.047 --> 00:30:38.748]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[00:30:54.853 --> 00:31:00.457]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[00:31:00.457 --> 00:31:04.039]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:31:04.039 --> 00:31:05.160]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:09.723]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:31:09.723 --> 00:31:15.668]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:31:15.668 --> 00:31:17.829]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:31:17.829 --> 00:31:20.491]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[00:31:20.851 --> 00:31:27.334]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoodsDirect.
[00:31:27.334 --> 00:31:29.555]  They both make fabulous investments.
[00:31:29.555 --> 00:31:34.897]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[00:31:34.897 --> 00:31:40.179]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[00:31:40.179 --> 00:31:45.542]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[00:31:45.542 --> 00:31:48.483]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[00:31:48.743 --> 00:31:51.646]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[00:31:51.646 --> 00:31:52.506]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[00:32:03.996 --> 00:32:05.257]  Tyranny is here.
[00:32:05.257 --> 00:32:09.182]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:32:09.182 --> 00:32:11.584]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:32:11.584 --> 00:32:17.290]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:23.517]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:32:23.957 --> 00:32:29.898]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:32:29.898 --> 00:32:34.099]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[00:32:34.099 --> 00:32:38.400]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:44.341]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:32:44.341 --> 00:32:47.901]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:32:47.901 --> 00:32:49.862]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:32:49.862 --> 00:32:50.302]  It's here.
[00:32:50.962 --> 00:32:57.388]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:11.866]  We have pointed out that the Muslim Brotherhood has basically been financed by British intelligence for more than 90 years.
[00:33:11.866 --> 00:33:20.472]  And that the revolution that we're seeing sweep all over the Middle East and North Africa, the epicenter of course being Cairo and Egypt,
[00:33:21.132 --> 00:33:21.372]  Yes.
[00:33:39.301 --> 00:33:40.902]  On his chalkboard, he's the leader.
[00:33:40.902 --> 00:33:43.644]  Van Jones is some low-level nobody.
[00:33:43.644 --> 00:33:55.692]  The Washington Post reported many years ago that tens of millions of dollars have been spent by the federal government to ship school books to Muslim schools around the world, radicalizing Muslims against the West.
[00:33:55.692 --> 00:34:06.300]  It's our own Department of Education, under both political parties, that promotes Arabic in schools as part of their Tower of Babel, Balkanization, multicultural move.
[00:34:07.295 --> 00:34:08.296]  And that's the problem.
[00:34:08.296 --> 00:34:20.906]  Glenn Beck is telling you that the Caliphate, which is basically just the rebirth of the Ottoman Empire, is this organic, socialist, Muslim movement, and that they're somehow teamed up with George Soros.
[00:34:20.906 --> 00:34:23.288]  Teamed up with George Soros?
[00:34:23.288 --> 00:34:31.175]  Even the London Telegraph has the headline, Egypt Protest, America's Secret Backing for Rebel Leaders Behind Uprising.
[00:34:31.835 --> 00:34:34.976]  And Glenn Beck would say, well, see, that's liberal Obama.
[00:34:34.976 --> 00:34:36.216]  Liberal Obama?
[00:34:36.216 --> 00:34:43.138]  Financed by the same Wall Street that funded George W. Bush and Karl Rove and his gaggle of crooks?
[00:34:43.138 --> 00:34:50.880]  It's on record that Zbigniew Brzezinski helped set up the Mujahideen, now known as Al Qaeda, in the Afghan war.
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:57.742]  It's on record that Anwar al-Awlaki, the supposed number one guy under Osama bin Laden,
[00:34:58.562 --> 00:35:07.364]  And Al Qaeda, when he was on the most wanted list, was meeting secretly at the Pentagon two months after 9-11 with the Secretary of the Army.
[00:35:07.364 --> 00:35:10.385]  Even Glenn Beck's own Fox News has reported that.
[00:35:10.385 --> 00:35:13.306]  It's on record that under Bush, U.S.
[00:35:13.306 --> 00:35:20.328]  embassies were ordered to let the supposed hijackers travel from Saudi Arabia into the United States.
[00:35:20.828 --> 00:35:23.669]  And said they're not really terrorists, they're working for us.
[00:35:23.669 --> 00:35:27.870]  It's on record that the State Department was given orders by an unnamed U.S.
[00:35:27.870 --> 00:35:28.251]  agency.
[00:35:28.251 --> 00:35:31.952]  The State Department submitted this to help get the underwear bomber on the plane.
[00:35:31.952 --> 00:35:35.313]  Do you think George Soros is doing that?
[00:35:35.313 --> 00:35:37.474]  Glenn Beck is engaged in a limited hangout.
[00:35:37.474 --> 00:35:40.555]  He's saying everything's Van Jones, everything's George Soros.
[00:35:40.555 --> 00:35:43.036]  Those are distasteful bad people.
[00:35:43.036 --> 00:35:48.958]  But what he's not explaining to you is that radical Islam has been controlled by the British pre-World War II,
[00:35:50.077 --> 00:35:55.479]  On record, then by Hitler, and then by Western intelligence, based in the United States.
[00:35:55.479 --> 00:36:05.884]  It was radical Muslims that were used to overthrow Mohammad Mosaddegh in Operation Ajax in 1953, because he was trying to modernize his nations and trying to keep their oil money for themselves.
[00:36:06.624 --> 00:36:24.853]  The globalists want radical Muslims who are oppressing women and dominating their regions so that they can keep them in squalor and use them as an enemy against the West so the New World Order can build up a police state here domestically in the name of countering it.
[00:36:25.353 --> 00:36:29.675]  And Glenn Beck and his writers, who fill his teleprompters, know this.
[00:36:29.675 --> 00:36:41.201]  This attempt to keep the Middle East, Central Asia and North Africa in the Stone Age has been going on for decades and is a grand strategy of destabilization.
[00:36:41.201 --> 00:36:42.541]  So Glenn Beck gets that right.
[00:36:42.541 --> 00:36:44.222]  This is destabilization.
[00:36:44.222 --> 00:36:49.685]  But he doesn't tell you that there are mega world government promoting corporations.
[00:36:50.868 --> 00:36:53.989]  He tells you that it's all Van Jones and George Soros.
[00:36:53.989 --> 00:37:01.011]  Sure, George Soros is one of this gaggle of corrupt globalists, but he's only one of them.
[00:37:01.011 --> 00:37:16.176]  Glenn Beck tells you now about the New World Order and world government, but does he tell you that General Electric and Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan and all these institutions helped fund the creation of the UN?
[00:37:16.176 --> 00:37:16.316]  No.
[00:37:17.196 --> 00:37:19.418]  See, this is full-spectrum dominance.
[00:37:19.418 --> 00:37:36.553]  The military-industrial complex that Eisenhower warned us about are masters at controlling all points on the compass and playing three-dimensional chess, being able to foresee how things are going to develop and how the dominoes are going to fall.
[00:37:37.173 --> 00:37:45.359]  And so yes, they don't want a pliant dictator that does what they say, but brings stability to the Middle East.
[00:37:45.359 --> 00:37:51.744]  They now want a stratagem of tension to create this great clash of civilizations.
[00:37:51.744 --> 00:37:53.385]  And that's what Glenn Beck isn't telling you.
[00:37:53.385 --> 00:37:58.649]  Glenn Beck is a knowing dupe, a willing Joseph McCarthy.
[00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:01.422]  Now I admire Joseph McCarthy.
[00:38:01.422 --> 00:38:03.425]  So let me be specific about this.
[00:38:03.425 --> 00:38:06.889]  He was a well-meaning person who was an unconscious dupe.
[00:38:06.889 --> 00:38:09.392]  Glenn Beck clearly is a conscious dupe.
[00:38:09.392 --> 00:38:10.894]  He's very intelligent.
[00:38:10.894 --> 00:38:13.177]  We have moles inside his organization.
[00:38:13.177 --> 00:38:14.618]  We know exactly what's going on.
[00:38:14.618 --> 00:38:16.441]  We know that they take the information that I cover.
[00:38:16.841 --> 00:38:30.475]  Ron Paul covers the true grassroots movement that we're leading and they synthesize it and turn it into a neocon light system so they can control the patriot revolution against tyranny in this country.
[00:38:30.475 --> 00:38:32.778]  Now he may not be evil himself individually,
[00:38:33.919 --> 00:38:40.988]  But he is someone who has come with the Fox News logo to co-opt the Liberty Movement in this country.
[00:38:40.988 --> 00:38:43.331]  And he's done a lot better in the last six months or so.
[00:38:43.331 --> 00:38:45.214]  We challenged him to cover eugenics.
[00:38:45.214 --> 00:38:48.358]  We've challenged him to cover the Global Population Reduction Program.
[00:38:48.358 --> 00:38:52.043]  And he's come a long way because you're putting pressure on him to do that.
[00:38:52.998 --> 00:39:18.835]  But in the final equation, he's taking on this patriotic camouflage because he needs to have your confidence at the key moment when they put the next neocon savior into place, stage terror attacks, and try to clamp down this homeland security police state grid that all administrations, from Jimmy Carter right through to Barack Obama, have been continuing to build.
[00:39:20.131 --> 00:39:24.152]  The bureaucracy is moving forward, setting up the control grid.
[00:39:24.152 --> 00:39:27.954]  That continuity of agenda is absolutely key to understand this.
[00:39:27.954 --> 00:39:40.298]  But going back to Joe McCarthy, a well-meaning guy being conned versus willing dupes like Obama and Glenn Beck, if you go back and study what happened with McCarthy, it's incredible.
[00:39:40.298 --> 00:39:42.059]  You'll understand what's happening now.
[00:39:42.059 --> 00:39:42.559]  When he was
[00:39:43.519 --> 00:39:54.005]  Setting up a police state and interrogating file clerks at the FBI and talking about how communists were hiding under every desk.
[00:39:54.005 --> 00:40:07.552]  He was loved because the government could set up a police state surveillance grid and get Americans to give up their cherished Bill of Rights and Constitution in the name of countering the horrible, tyrannical, Stalinistic threat.
[00:40:07.552 --> 00:40:09.833]  But then McCarthy did deep research.
[00:40:10.526 --> 00:40:10.606]  Yes.
[00:40:24.195 --> 00:40:28.677]  has helped turn over China to the communist.
[00:40:28.677 --> 00:40:30.578]  And the media laughed and cackled.
[00:40:30.578 --> 00:40:41.303]  And Joe McCarthy went overnight for being this big messianic hero who could do no wrong because he was countering the communist threat by calling for the destruction of our own liberties.
[00:40:41.303 --> 00:40:47.226]  See, by facing that devil, we dance with the devil, we become the devil, they're able to centralize control.
[00:40:47.226 --> 00:40:52.989]  But as soon as he found out that the White House, that the Pentagon, that the State Department
[00:40:53.709 --> 00:40:56.631]  We're actually funding communism and supporting it.
[00:40:56.631 --> 00:40:58.893]  Overnight, he was politically destroyed.
[00:40:58.893 --> 00:40:59.734]  They laughed at him.
[00:40:59.734 --> 00:41:02.656]  They said, sir, do you have no decency?
[00:41:02.656 --> 00:41:08.941]  And he was politically destroyed with all the dirt that they had on him for the alcoholism and the rest of it.
[00:41:08.941 --> 00:41:09.982]  He was only human.
[00:41:09.982 --> 00:41:12.124]  But you see, Glenn Beck isn't making that mistake.
[00:41:12.124 --> 00:41:17.548]  He isn't telling you that the Pentagon and the State Department are helping get underwear bombers on planes.
[00:41:17.728 --> 00:41:26.695]  He's not telling you that Ammar al-Awlaki, the number one guy under Osama bin Laden, who's running the underwear bomber, the Times Square attack, the Fort Hood shooting, the shoe bomber.
[00:41:27.705 --> 00:41:29.786]  is admittedly a globalist agent.
[00:41:29.786 --> 00:41:31.528]  This isn't our military at the top.
[00:41:31.528 --> 00:41:33.089]  It isn't our government at the top.
[00:41:33.089 --> 00:41:38.272]  It's a foreign banking cartel that's stolen tens of trillions from us.
[00:41:38.272 --> 00:41:41.494]  And they are financing the Muslim revolutions.
[00:41:41.494 --> 00:41:44.916]  They are financing the socialist revolutions.
[00:41:44.916 --> 00:41:48.198]  The big mega banks have always funded socialism because they
[00:41:49.119 --> 00:41:55.364]  Get the horde, the mass, the angry mob, to loot the middle class, thinking they're going to get part of the money.
[00:41:55.364 --> 00:42:06.472]  They get chicken feed, poultry, table scraps, and the rest of it is transferred to corporate welfare, to the defense system, to trillion-dollar banker bailouts.
[00:42:06.472 --> 00:42:09.574]  And Glenn Beck will not do what McCarthy did.
[00:42:09.574 --> 00:42:13.077]  He'll tell you there's communists all day, and there are.
[00:42:13.077 --> 00:42:16.119]  But he won't tell you that they're funded by the big megabanks.
[00:42:16.619 --> 00:42:21.924]  Oh, he'll pick out George Soros, who's definitely a dangerous globalist, but he'll leave it at that.
[00:42:21.924 --> 00:42:31.953]  He's splitting it again into a left-right paradigm, that, oh, there's this liberal Soros, he runs it all, when Soros is only one small piece of this larger system.
[00:42:31.953 --> 00:42:41.041]  Yes, it's true that George Soros-connected groups have been supporting the Muslim Brotherhood and other organizations that are trying to take over Egypt.
[00:42:41.772 --> 00:42:50.415]  But it's also true that our Pentagon and the State Department and our government has been financing him for decades.
[00:42:50.415 --> 00:42:53.136]  And that's what Glenn Beck isn't telling you.
[00:42:53.136 --> 00:42:54.876]  That's what he won't talk about.
[00:42:54.876 --> 00:42:59.337]  Because if he did that, he'd be destroyed just like Joseph McCarthy.
[00:42:59.337 --> 00:43:02.258]  But the difference is, Joe didn't know what he was doing.
[00:43:02.258 --> 00:43:06.740]  Glenn is willingly engaging in this duplicity.
[00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:10.721]  Any way you slice it, Van Jones is not at the top of the pyramid.
[00:43:12.352 --> 00:43:17.760]  Yes, George Soros is very near the top, but he's only one operative in this system.
[00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:21.246]  And the whole world is a stage and each of us players upon it.
[00:43:21.246 --> 00:43:25.272]  Let's not let Glenn Beck co-opt the answer to 1984-1776 movement.
[00:43:27.936 --> 00:43:29.277]  You are that movement.
[00:43:29.277 --> 00:43:32.698]  Ideas are invincible when they have truth on their side.
[00:43:32.698 --> 00:43:35.219]  Ideas are bulletproof.
[00:43:35.219 --> 00:43:37.179]  And Glenn's come a long way.
[00:43:37.179 --> 00:43:40.020]  That's why I'm not making my film about Glenn Beck.
[00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:43.421]  That's why I'm not attacking him.
[00:43:43.421 --> 00:43:46.962]  Even though every time I watch, I see the deception.
[00:43:46.962 --> 00:43:52.844]  Because we're trying to get him to move truly towards the spirit of 1776.
[00:43:52.844 --> 00:43:56.806]  And if we demand liberty and freedom, the system will respond.
[00:43:57.916 --> 00:43:59.138]  And that's beginning to happen.
[00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:17.681]  Very complex.
[00:44:17.681 --> 00:44:23.049]  And if we're going to have true liberty, folks need to do their research and find out the truth for themselves.
[00:44:23.049 --> 00:44:30.559]  It's a lot more complex than a chalkboard with some socialist unions and Van Jones.
[00:44:30.559 --> 00:44:32.682]  And yes, Glenn Beck overall tells the truth.
[00:44:33.123 --> 00:44:40.706]  That these powerful communist elites want revolution to destabilize things so that they can come to power.
[00:44:40.706 --> 00:45:00.275]  But what he doesn't tell you is that the mega banks have always promoted communism for the common man as a way of outlawing their competition and through government, taking our tax money and putting it into offshore havens that are immune from the socialistic communism that they visit upon us.
[00:45:01.135 --> 00:45:04.598]  Glenn, tell the full truth.
[00:45:04.598 --> 00:45:09.703]  Don't tell us that the New World Order just started and George Soros created it.
[00:45:09.703 --> 00:45:16.388]  George Soros' people told mine in a very threatening way, the ship has already sailed.
[00:45:16.388 --> 00:45:19.331]  There will be a New World Order.
[00:45:19.331 --> 00:45:22.534]  Get on the team or get out!
[00:45:22.534 --> 00:45:24.776]  And I've seen you move in the right direction.
[00:45:24.776 --> 00:45:25.556]  Come all the way.
[00:45:26.557 --> 00:45:30.981]  And I give you my word that I will support you at that point.
[00:45:30.981 --> 00:45:33.623]  I want to see you do the right thing.
[00:45:33.623 --> 00:45:47.134]  I don't want to see you sit there and play into this Muslim phobia when, on record, Republicans and Democrats are part of the social engineering system and are doing everything they can to protect radical Muslims.
[00:45:47.901 --> 00:45:57.505]  The evidence is right there where our own government is supporting the Muslim Brotherhood who's calling to break the peace treaty with Israel to destabilize the region.
[00:45:57.505 --> 00:46:01.966]  I'm honored and thankful at many levels that you're taking our information.
[00:46:01.966 --> 00:46:05.108]  But I'm also frustrated that you still twist it.
[00:46:05.108 --> 00:46:08.149]  People out there need to understand that Alex Jones isn't your leader.
[00:46:09.155 --> 00:46:10.876]  Glenn Beck isn't your leader.
[00:46:10.876 --> 00:46:16.400]  Common sense, the Bill of Rights and Constitution is the sheet of music we need to be singing from.
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:20.583]  And Glenn Beck talks about how he loves the spirit of 1776.
[00:46:20.583 --> 00:46:25.847]  But on so many fundamentals, he doesn't support that Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:46:25.847 --> 00:46:29.130]  And he says, don't support it when we're fighting the Muslims.
[00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:35.635]  But the radicalized Muslims are on record funded by his bosses.
[00:46:35.635 --> 00:46:39.398]  You want to find the New World Order, look at Rupert Murdoch, Glenn.
[00:46:39.398 --> 00:46:46.084]  Rupert Murdoch is a big Davos attendee, promotes globalism, promotes carbon taxes, promotes everything George Soros does.
[00:46:46.084 --> 00:46:50.788]  But because he's cloaked in the Fox News mantle, he's not criticized.
[00:46:50.788 --> 00:46:55.593]  Awake Americans that we've awakened are just some market for you to exploit.
[00:46:56.818 --> 00:46:58.118]  And that's wrong!
[00:46:58.118 --> 00:47:00.119]  This is life and death we're dealing with!
[00:47:00.119 --> 00:47:17.284]  And until I see Glenn Beck talk about Amor Al-Awlaki working for the Pentagon and running all the terrorists, and until I hear Glenn talk about the See Something Say Something campaign and how it's all meant to have us tattle on each other, we know that you're working for the dark side.
[00:47:17.284 --> 00:47:18.265]  All right, Glenn.
[00:47:18.265 --> 00:47:19.745]  You can't have it both ways.
[00:47:19.745 --> 00:47:21.145]  Decide which side you're on.
[00:47:21.145 --> 00:47:25.827]  And now is the time to get involved and expose the globalists, but not just their communist henchmen.
[00:47:27.449 --> 00:47:29.150]  But the actual controllers.
[00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:39.075]  It is extremely exciting that Glenn Beck is having to talk about the New World Order and world government even if he's blaming it on mid-level patsies.
[00:47:39.075 --> 00:47:41.637]  It shows how far our movement to get the truth out is.
[00:47:42.193 --> 00:47:52.515]  The fact that this information has become so mainline shows that a renaissance of liberty, a rediscovering of the spirit of 1776 is upon us.
[00:47:52.515 --> 00:47:56.456]  And each and every one of us don't have front row seats to history.
[00:47:56.456 --> 00:47:59.777]  We're active participants on the field.
[00:47:59.777 --> 00:48:08.279]  And to all of you that have gotten the word out over the years, to all of you that have stood up and told the truth and laughed at by your neighbors, they're not laughing now.
[00:48:08.919 --> 00:48:11.521]  The people are ready to hear the truth.
[00:48:11.521 --> 00:48:13.222]  Get out there.
[00:48:13.222 --> 00:48:16.765]  Together we can accelerate this awakening process.
[00:48:16.765 --> 00:48:22.890]  And we can ensure that there is a force of awakened people that understand the true paradigm.
[00:48:22.890 --> 00:48:25.752]  And we can defeat this new world order.
[00:48:27.253 --> 00:48:46.461]  So you've just heard Alex Jones there break down the deception being conducted by Glenn Beck and others in the media, invoking the threat of radical Islam, which is a real threat, but completely omitting the fact that radical Muslims are being controlled by the US
[00:48:46.621 --> 00:48:48.722]  Military Industrial Complex.
[00:48:48.722 --> 00:49:03.652]  And we were going through a list of how that's evident in every single terror plot that's been blamed on radical Islam that's occurred in the United States, certainly since 9-11, and also even before 9-11.
[00:49:03.652 --> 00:49:07.274]  I mean, take for example the recent Portland plot.
[00:49:07.274 --> 00:49:12.518]  Mohammed Osman Mohammedud, who was accused of, you know, trying to
[00:49:13.732 --> 00:49:17.953]  Blow up this Christmas tree ceremony there in Portland.
[00:49:17.953 --> 00:49:34.115]  Came out in the court case, of course, that the FBI had not only given him the cell phone, the van, the vehicle, and other implements that are used to help him carry out the aborted attack, they gave him the bomb!
[00:49:34.115 --> 00:49:37.576]  The FBI agents gave him the bomb!
[00:49:37.576 --> 00:49:39.416]  It's just a byline!
[00:49:39.416 --> 00:49:43.097]  You know, two weeks after it all blows over, nobody cares anymore.
[00:49:44.136 --> 00:49:46.358]  Our own, you know, top story today.
[00:49:46.358 --> 00:49:50.202]  Terrorists who trained London bombers was working for US government.
[00:49:50.202 --> 00:50:09.219]  The guy who set up the Pakistani training camps in 2003, where the alleged ringleader of 7-7, Mohammed Sadiq Khan, learned how to make a bomb, the guy teaching him was at the same time working as an informant for the US government.
[00:50:10.526 --> 00:50:14.689]  Take the Mumbai massacre, 2008.
[00:50:14.689 --> 00:50:22.035]  David Headley, the supposed mastermind behind the plot, turned out, again, US government informant.
[00:50:22.035 --> 00:50:23.736]  That was in the London Times.
[00:50:23.736 --> 00:50:30.641]  Every single case that we have listed in this article is linked to a mainstream news source confirming the fact.
[00:50:31.602 --> 00:50:34.444]  Okay, take the shoe bomber, Richard Reid.
[00:50:34.444 --> 00:50:38.366]  He was brainwashed in the Finsbury Park Mosque in London.
[00:50:38.366 --> 00:50:43.230]  The head imam at the time, Abu Hamza al-Masri, the famous Hukanda cleric.
[00:50:43.230 --> 00:50:45.411]  He's been working with British intelligence since 97!
[00:50:46.972 --> 00:50:55.354]  In every case, the indoctrination of the radical Islamist threat is being conducted by the federal government, by the British authorities.
[00:50:55.354 --> 00:51:00.275]  We'll be back after the break to talk more about this with Aaron Dykes, live in studio.
[00:51:00.275 --> 00:51:01.475]  It's the Alex Jones Show Live!
[00:51:01.475 --> 00:51:05.976]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:52:03.032 --> 00:52:05.354]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:52:05.354 --> 00:52:08.577]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:08.577 --> 00:52:13.682]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:13.682 --> 00:52:17.866]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:18.186 --> 00:52:20.527]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:20.527 --> 00:52:23.068]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:23.068 --> 00:52:26.330]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:26.330 --> 00:52:33.933]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:34.269 --> 00:52:39.654]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:39.654 --> 00:52:41.977]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:41.977 --> 00:52:46.201]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:46.201 --> 00:52:47.262]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:47.262 --> 00:52:48.603]  You're everyone else.

[00:54:17.765 --> 00:54:21.706]  We're back live on the Alex Jones Show this Monday, February 14th.
[00:54:21.706 --> 00:54:24.127]  Paul Joseph Watson sitting in for Alex today.
[00:54:24.127 --> 00:54:38.391]  We're talking about the radical Islamic threat and how people like Glenn Beck will invoke this constantly while failing to point out the true culprits behind it.
[00:54:38.391 --> 00:54:41.232]  And we're joined in studio to co-host
[00:54:42.192 --> 00:54:48.896]  For the remainder of this broadcast, we'll be playing an interview in the final hour, which will be a rebroadcast.
[00:54:48.896 --> 00:55:08.846]  But Aaron Dykes, who wrote the big article on Saturday regarding the Egyptian revolution and how people like Glenn Beck and others in the media are completely obfuscating the fact that this is a contrivance of the Brzezinski crowd and the grand chess board that goes along with it.
[00:55:09.566 --> 00:55:12.430]  Aaron Dykes, good to co-host with you today.
[00:55:12.430 --> 00:55:13.852]  Hi Paul, how you doing?
[00:55:14.875 --> 00:55:15.715]  Great!
[00:55:15.715 --> 00:55:41.326]  Now I was on the treadmill on Friday night and I was listening to the Glenn Beck program, the fusion of entertainment and enlightenment as they call it, and he was talking about how this Egyptian revolution and the fact that they got rid of Mubarak was a deadly threat to America because now the Muslim Brotherhood would take a stranglehold of power.
[00:55:41.326 --> 00:55:44.387]  You've got the election coming up in six months now in Egypt.
[00:55:45.147 --> 00:55:58.173]  Of course he completely failed to point out the fact that the Wahhabi Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood was founded and financed from its very inception by the CIA.
[00:55:58.173 --> 00:56:08.678]  And then on Saturday you wrote the article with Alex which talks about the history of some of this and the grand chessboard behind what's happening in Egypt.
[00:56:08.678 --> 00:56:12.140]  So go ahead and talk to us about that article.
[00:56:12.580 --> 00:56:20.224]  Yeah, bottom line, how long has British intelligence been messing around in the region for their own colonial interests?
[00:56:20.224 --> 00:56:33.010]  They totally have contrived the whole Arab thing, and it's just like they contrived communist threat during the Soviet era, when we find out that we built them up all along, and they're supposed to be our great enemy throughout the world.
[00:56:33.010 --> 00:56:41.034]  It's just ridiculous that people like Glenn Beck won't focus on the military interests behind this all, and I'm flabbergasted by it.
[00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:47.505]  You know, specifically in the article, we've seen all these color revolutions over the past couple years.
[00:56:47.505 --> 00:57:00.977]  Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, other places in Central Asia, all fit into this Brzezinski scheme to encircle Russia and guarantee basically the Anglo-Allied interest.
[00:57:03.083 --> 00:57:24.611]  Which is important because, of course, the man now being touted as one of the primary contenders to be the new Egyptian president is Mohamed ElBaradei, who sits on the board of this international crisis group, which by no coincidence is controlled by Zbig, the big new Brzezinski,
[00:57:25.431 --> 00:57:37.761]  Who was the author of this grand chessboard and who was fundamental in financing the Arab Mujahideen along with Osama Bin Laden to fight the Soviets in 1979.
[00:57:37.761 --> 00:57:46.348]  And of course it was Brzezinski who in a CFR speech last year I believe in June in Canada said that
[00:57:47.208 --> 00:58:12.552]  Very imminently there would be this mass global awakening that people were becoming more angry about their grievances, especially young people in the Middle East and in Africa, and that we would soon see a grand political awakening primarily led by young people, which is exactly what we've now seen in Tunisia, in Egypt of course, and now in Algeria and other countries.
[00:58:13.492 --> 00:58:23.137]  So the globalists were prepared for it and they groomed their selected candidates to swoop in and hijack these revolutions in the aftermath.
[00:58:23.137 --> 00:58:31.221]  So we'll continue to delve into those subjects and more here on the Alex Jones Show on this Monday, February 14th edition.
[00:58:31.221 --> 00:58:35.183]  Stay tuned, you can watch the live stream at prisonplanet.tv.
[00:58:35.183 --> 00:58:35.803]  Don't go away.

[01:00:05.185 --> 01:00:10.011]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.011 --> 01:00:11.593]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.593 --> 01:00:13.515]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.515 --> 01:00:17.340]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:21.405]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.183 --> 01:00:25.425]  Second hour of the Alex Jones Show today.
[01:00:25.425 --> 01:00:28.028]  Paul Joseph Watson filling in for Alex.
[01:00:28.028 --> 01:00:33.915]  We've also got Aaron Dykes, InfoWars writer and researcher in studio.
[01:00:33.915 --> 01:00:38.200]  And Aaron is co-hosting the rest of the broadcast with me today.
[01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:40.323]  We're talking about Glenn Beck.
[01:00:40.783 --> 01:01:03.288]  Not just Glenn Beck, but basically the entirety of the so-called right-wing neocon media, who have become very upset about the possibility of the Muslim Brotherhood taking the reins of power in Egypt, and certainly other countries in the region, following this apparent wave of revolutions that shows no sign of abating.
[01:01:03.288 --> 01:01:07.409]  And basically Beck is trying to invoke the Islamic threat
[01:01:08.089 --> 01:01:09.470]  But not in an honest way.
[01:01:09.470 --> 01:01:30.578]  He's trying to tie it into this so-called global communist conspiracy for one world government that he's always talking about it, without mentioning the truth, which is the fact that both communism and radical Islam are merely tools of the New World Order being used to advance the overall agenda for global government.
[01:01:31.559 --> 01:01:43.116]  Now Aaron Dykes wrote an article on Saturday called Dear Glenn Beck, Egypt destabilization opt hatched by globalists not communists and in this article
[01:01:44.304 --> 01:02:00.817]  He explains how this wave of revolutions is about a globalist agenda to destabilize the region so they can then swoop in with their carefully groomed establishment candidates to take over the reins of power.
[01:02:00.817 --> 01:02:05.801]  At the moment in Egypt the situation is Mubarak resigned on Friday.
[01:02:05.801 --> 01:02:08.884]  There were reports out of Israel that he suffered a
[01:02:09.204 --> 01:02:15.806]  Some kind of stroke and he's now in fact in a coma and now in Egypt the military have taken command.
[01:02:15.806 --> 01:02:21.327]  They've temporarily suspended the constitution and are now saying that strikes are illegal.
[01:02:21.327 --> 01:02:27.789]  They're saying you can still protest but they're telling the protesters to go home while pointing guns at them so...
[01:02:28.729 --> 01:02:30.370]  Mixed message somewhat.
[01:02:30.370 --> 01:02:46.295]  So basically it's a military dictatorship, temporarily at least, and the key issue is who will take control of the country in this election in six months' time, and which candidate, you know, what interest they'll represent.
[01:02:46.295 --> 01:02:53.317]  Because the globalists under Brzezinski certainly have their finger in the melting pot.
[01:02:53.317 --> 01:02:57.239]  Aaron, any other points you wanted to mention about your article?
[01:02:58.346 --> 01:03:08.148]  Uh, well, yeah, Paul, because the Harots was also reporting it was a quiet military coup behind Mubarak's resignation, which we know was a U.S.
[01:03:08.148 --> 01:03:11.068]  military backed silent coup.
[01:03:11.068 --> 01:03:20.270]  And that's just part of the whole game that people like Glenn Beck will tell you it's radical Islam with the left hand, but they won't explain what's going on with the right hand.
[01:03:20.270 --> 01:03:24.851]  Certainly we can hope that this region isn't going to become more radical than it already is.
[01:03:25.371 --> 01:03:25.652]  I think?
[01:03:44.935 --> 01:03:59.975]  George Soros was indicated in that kind of popular uprising and I really wonder if that's just a rebranding effort the same as we saw with the change of guard from Bush to Obama when there was very little substantive change between the two.
[01:03:59.975 --> 01:04:00.596]  What do you think, Paul?
[01:04:02.281 --> 01:04:26.924]  Well exactly and I mean what's amazing about that you mention about the no substantive change between Obama and Bush is the fact that today we've got this young Americans for Freedom group coming out and I believe Kurt Nimmo has posted an article on this on Infowars.com in the past couple of hours expelling Congressman Ron Paul from their movement because of his quote
[01:04:27.424 --> 01:04:32.787]  Delusional and disturbing alliance with the fringe anti-war movement.
[01:04:32.787 --> 01:04:46.035]  And they, in fact, point out that the Obama administration is, quote, a feeble and appeasing administration, and will point out their hypocrisy in the next segment on the Alex Jones Show at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:04:46.035 --> 01:04:46.736]  Don't go away.
[01:05:00.401 --> 01:05:04.965]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[01:05:04.965 --> 01:05:05.866]  Number one.
[01:05:05.866 --> 01:05:09.309]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:09.309 --> 01:05:10.169]  Number two.
[01:05:10.169 --> 01:05:15.053]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:15.053 --> 01:05:15.794]  It's true.
[01:05:15.794 --> 01:05:20.678]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:20.678 --> 01:05:21.499]  Number three.
[01:05:21.499 --> 01:05:25.082]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:25.082 --> 01:05:28.765]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:28.985 --> 01:05:29.765]  Number 4.
[01:05:29.765 --> 01:05:32.526]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:32.526 --> 01:05:36.206]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:36.206 --> 01:05:37.006]  Number 5.
[01:05:37.006 --> 01:05:41.147]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:05:41.147 --> 01:05:46.208]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:05:46.208 --> 01:05:50.369]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:50.369 --> 01:05:52.169]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:52.169 --> 01:05:56.770]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[01:06:00.553 --> 01:06:04.136]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[01:06:04.136 --> 01:06:05.437]  It ended on June of 2009.
[01:06:05.437 --> 01:06:09.841]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[01:06:09.841 --> 01:06:15.787]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[01:06:15.787 --> 01:06:17.928]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[01:06:17.928 --> 01:06:20.611]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[01:06:20.951 --> 01:06:27.456]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[01:06:27.456 --> 01:06:29.657]  They both make fabulous investments.
[01:06:29.657 --> 01:06:35.001]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[01:06:35.001 --> 01:06:40.285]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[01:06:40.285 --> 01:06:45.469]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[01:06:45.649 --> 01:06:48.830]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[01:06:48.830 --> 01:06:51.851]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.

[01:06:52.631 --> 01:06:53.211]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:06:53.211 --> 01:06:56.832]  citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:06:56.832 --> 01:06:58.332]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:07:10.615 --> 01:07:16.000]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.042]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:07:19.042 --> 01:07:21.364]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:07:21.364 --> 01:07:27.269]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:07:27.589 --> 01:07:30.970]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:07:30.970 --> 01:07:36.752]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:07:36.752 --> 01:07:38.392]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:07:38.392 --> 01:07:39.692]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:07:39.692 --> 01:07:42.373]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:07:42.373 --> 01:07:46.594]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:07:46.594 --> 01:07:49.275]  You can find the video at www.barronjones.com
[01:07:49.415 --> 01:07:54.037]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:54.037 --> 01:07:56.018]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:15.612 --> 01:08:21.678]  It's Paul Joseph Watson, writer and editor for PrisonPlanet.com filling in for Alex.
[01:08:21.678 --> 01:08:25.842]  Now we've got Aaron Dykes also co-hosting in studio.
[01:08:25.842 --> 01:08:36.692]  Before the break I was just getting into this story about how the Young Americans for Freedom organization, YAF, announced Saturday that they were going to expand
[01:08:36.772 --> 01:08:55.192]  Spell Ron Paul from their organization because of his quote delusional and disturbing alliance with the fringe anti-war movement and basically they they labeled the Obama administration as quote feeble and appeasing and attempted to lump
[01:08:56.073 --> 01:09:10.500]  Ron Paul in with the Obama administration and make out that he was some kind of weak-minded liberal and that he didn't want to support carpet bombing brown people in the third world.
[01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:15.863]  Now, the first thing to address on this is the fact that
[01:09:17.062 --> 01:09:33.427]  They label Obama and his administration feeble and appeasing, when in fact the Obama administration war chest, year after year, has been bigger than anything that was ever passed under George W. Bush.
[01:09:33.427 --> 01:09:39.389]  In fact, Obama's 2011 war chest swelled to more than 700 billion dollars, which is more than Bush ever got.
[01:09:44.150 --> 01:09:49.873]  You know, there are more troops in Afghanistan now under Obama than there ever were under Bush.
[01:09:49.873 --> 01:09:57.998]  And Obama's tacit withdrawal of some troops out of Iraq, you know, they've only been replaced by more mercenaries.
[01:09:57.998 --> 01:10:12.407]  The first thing that Obama did upon his election was to send 30,000 more troops into Afghanistan, expand the Bush-era bombings in Pakistan, as well as opening up a new front in Yemen.
[01:10:13.027 --> 01:10:25.478]  So if you think that bombing brown people in the third world for the security interests of the United States is conservative, then you should support the Obama administration.
[01:10:25.478 --> 01:10:33.625]  And yet the young Americans for Freedom are saying that Ron Paul isn't a real conservative because he doesn't support that.
[01:10:36.499 --> 01:10:51.289]  The fact that Obama has a bigger military budget than Bush year upon year gives a pretty clear indication that occupying and invading foreign countries has nothing to do with true conservatism.
[01:10:53.450 --> 01:11:06.137]  Of course, the foundational belief system of the neocons, and this came to light during the Iraq invasion in 2003, is Leon Trotsky.
[01:11:06.137 --> 01:11:08.778]  Remember the article out of the National Post?
[01:11:08.778 --> 01:11:12.180]  Trotsky's ghost wandering the White House.
[01:11:12.180 --> 01:11:17.162]  And Trotsky, of course, was the head of the Fourth International, the communist organisation.
[01:11:18.783 --> 01:11:29.593]  I mean, he was the author of the Doctrine of Preemptive War, and this is the guy who the top neocons in the Bush era helped launch the Iraq War.
[01:11:29.593 --> 01:11:32.736]  They were the authors of the PNAC document.
[01:11:32.736 --> 01:11:35.518]  You know, Trotsky was their philosophical guru.
[01:11:36.899 --> 01:11:42.545]  As well as Leo Strauss, this other neoconservative icon.
[01:11:42.545 --> 01:11:55.576]  A man who advocated that the state engage in perpetual deception of its citizens in order to create absolute power and basically pure fascism.
[01:11:56.357 --> 01:12:08.748]  So this is the philosophical foundation of the neocon belief of preemptive warfare that Obama is now aggressively continuing, having picked up the baton from Bush.
[01:12:08.748 --> 01:12:14.012]  And because Ron Paul opposes that, because he's a real founding father conservative,
[01:12:14.673 --> 01:12:19.697]  The Founding Fathers, of course, advocated a non-interventionist foreign policy.
[01:12:19.697 --> 01:12:28.343]  Because Ron Paul sides with the Founding Fathers, this pathetic little neocon organisation has kicked him out of their group.
[01:12:28.343 --> 01:12:37.290]  But, I mean, Aaron, shouldn't Ron Paul be absolutely honoured and proud to be rid of this group, given who they align themselves with?
[01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:38.771]  They should, Paul.
[01:12:53.631 --> 01:12:54.352]  We're good to go.
[01:13:22.913 --> 01:13:28.857]  Sarah Palin saying cutting defense and military spending is no longer a sacred cow.
[01:13:28.857 --> 01:13:32.719]  That this debt bubble is hitting at the right time.
[01:13:32.719 --> 01:13:41.505]  Just as we see this stuff happening in Egypt, it's very hopeful that we're seeing Ron Paul and other people talking about cutting the military budget.
[01:13:41.505 --> 01:13:45.727]  Of course you saw Ron Paul mention that in part of his speech.
[01:13:45.727 --> 01:13:49.070]  I think that part of the establishment associated with the neocons,
[01:13:49.830 --> 01:14:10.812]  Feels very threatened that they can even talk about in these debates cutting the military budget because it's done nothing but build up regardless of left or right presidents for the past 60 years or so and of course with Obama you see a continuity of government not only because we know who's really calling the shots behind the scenes but because they all want war.
[01:14:11.853 --> 01:14:21.240]  You see his Deputy Secretary of State under Hillary Steinberg, he wrote a paper called Preventive War, Useful Tools.
[01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:38.912]  So they're all just of this neocon mindset and to see someone like Ron Paul coming in with a strong backing, stronger than he was in 2008, this whole wave has grown, they're very concerned about a return to true conservatism or just into this anti-war paradigm.
[01:14:38.912 --> 01:14:40.554]  Well, I mean, if they were so
[01:14:41.687 --> 01:14:52.493]  If they really thought that Ron Paul could never win the election, as Donald Trump said last week, why would they so obsessively trash him every opportunity they get?
[01:14:52.493 --> 01:15:07.460]  They're obviously scared about the fact that somebody like Ron Paul has got the grassroots movement behind him to get the motivation, to get the snowball effect that could really lead him to challenge Obama.
[01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:08.341]  I remember we had the
[01:15:09.361 --> 01:15:22.654]  Rasmussen poll last year, I believe it was April 2010, which showed that if there was an election there and then between Ron Paul and Barack Obama, that Obama would only win by 1%.
[01:15:22.654 --> 01:15:28.319]  And that's with a significant portion of the US voting public
[01:15:28.499 --> 01:15:36.081]  A lot of them still don't even know who Ron Paul is because he hasn't had the chance to get a significant platform as part of a national debate.
[01:15:36.081 --> 01:15:44.503]  But even without that, he was shown as only being one percentage point behind Obama if they had gone head-to-head.
[01:15:44.503 --> 01:15:56.547]  Granted, that's come down a little in the past couple of months, but only because Obama enjoyed this 15-point bounce in the aftermath of the Tucson shootings.
[01:15:56.547 --> 01:15:57.207]  But still,
[01:15:58.487 --> 01:16:08.192]  As I talked about on Friday, a Rasmussen poll last week showed that Ron Paul had a better chance of defeating Obama than Sarah Palin.
[01:16:08.192 --> 01:16:14.375]  Now, Palin's obviously going to be the darling of the establishment Republicans and the co-opted Tea Party.
[01:16:15.395 --> 01:16:19.817]  And yet Ron Paul's got a better chance of going head-to-head with Obama.
[01:16:19.817 --> 01:16:32.303]  So it just shows that this idea that he's got no chance of winning the presidency is a tactic on behalf of the neocons to create a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[01:16:32.303 --> 01:16:39.846]  Because all the polls show that he's got a very real chance of beating Obama if it was a level playing field, which of course the
[01:16:40.166 --> 01:16:51.191]  Establishment media is determined not to be the case which is why during the 2008 campaign they consistently trashed Ron Paul's name similar to how they
[01:16:52.756 --> 01:17:15.514]  Through all manner of mud at Rand Paul during his recent senatorial campaign, which of course was completely skewed, distorted, it was a massive smear on every level, everything they threw at him, from the Aqua Buddha to the Civil Rights Force, and yet Rand Paul still easily defeated his opponents, become senator, and now indeed
[01:17:16.215 --> 01:17:19.658]  You know, Rand Paul's talking about maybe running for president.
[01:17:19.658 --> 01:17:34.270]  So, I mean, the game has changed in the past four years and I don't think they'll be able to discredit Ron Paul to the extent that they were four or five years ago, which means that he's got a very real chance if he gets that momentum going.
[01:17:35.245 --> 01:17:47.215]  I think he does, and I think it's just that you see this contrived media voice always talking about Sarah Palin, always saying that, you know, certain establishment candidates are the only one anyone's going to pay attention to.
[01:17:47.215 --> 01:17:53.280]  But it shows the power of the Internet that the Ron Paul movement, the supporters for Rand Paul have been out there.
[01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:56.122]  And look what they're doing once they're in office.
[01:17:56.122 --> 01:18:00.806]  We may not be able to trust the Republicans themselves, but Rand Paul came out strongly
[01:18:01.366 --> 01:18:07.190]  For not extending the Patriot Act, even though the House ended up voting for it in that second vote.
[01:18:07.190 --> 01:18:14.996]  We've seen Ron Paul talking about really just sacred cow issues, cutting the military budget, bringing home the troops as he has for years.
[01:18:14.996 --> 01:18:19.279]  Now it's finally gaining traction and I think the system's freaked out by that.
[01:18:19.279 --> 01:18:24.422]  But it really is a contrived media thing to have all these people saying Ron Paul can't win.
[01:18:24.422 --> 01:18:26.304]  Not only is it a self-fulfilling prophecy,
[01:18:26.744 --> 01:18:26.984]  But it's
[01:18:42.290 --> 01:18:44.931]  The script for Mitt Romney had been contrived.
[01:18:44.931 --> 01:18:51.152]  It had all these buzzwords, calling him a hero, saying how he had saved the Olympics, how he had done all these wonderful things.
[01:18:51.152 --> 01:18:56.433]  When we had them rewrite it and use neutral terms, he didn't poll nearly as high.
[01:18:56.433 --> 01:19:03.215]  So that's just an example of how you can see the media contrivance and who they predict, supposedly, as winners in these races.
[01:19:03.215 --> 01:19:07.356]  So hopefully Ron Paul has gained enough traction that he'll get a fair shot this time.
[01:19:07.356 --> 01:19:07.936]  And I hope he runs.
[01:19:09.636 --> 01:19:10.296]  Well, exactly.
[01:19:10.296 --> 01:19:11.697]  He hasn't announced yet.
[01:19:11.697 --> 01:19:13.197]  He's expected to announce.
[01:19:13.197 --> 01:19:23.820]  I mean, all the candidates at this CPAC conference are expected to announce their candidacy for president, so we all expect Ron Paul to do the same.
[01:19:23.820 --> 01:19:25.581]  What's important about it is that
[01:19:26.221 --> 01:19:37.328]  Him and Rand have stayed true to their principles as real conservatives and not Marxists like Leon Trotsky as all these other neocons worship.
[01:19:37.328 --> 01:19:44.733]  And that's the reason why his popularity remains and why the grassroots movement behind him remains so strong.
[01:19:44.733 --> 01:19:48.335]  We'll be back on the Alex Jones Show after the break.
[01:19:48.335 --> 01:19:51.197]  Watch the live stream at PrisonAtPlanet.tv.
[01:19:51.197 --> 01:19:51.838]  Stay tuned.
[01:20:00.962 --> 01:20:05.046]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[01:20:05.046 --> 01:20:09.550]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[01:20:09.550 --> 01:20:15.716]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[01:20:15.716 --> 01:20:18.158]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[01:20:18.158 --> 01:20:24.104]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[01:20:24.244 --> 01:20:27.648]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[01:20:27.648 --> 01:20:29.510]  There is no other program of its kind.
[01:20:29.510 --> 01:20:31.693]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.

[01:21:00.407 --> 01:21:01.588]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:21:01.588 --> 01:21:08.552]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:21:08.552 --> 01:21:11.114]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:21:11.114 --> 01:21:16.538]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:21:16.538 --> 01:21:19.480]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:21:19.480 --> 01:21:21.541]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:21:21.781 --> 01:21:28.063]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:21:28.063 --> 01:21:31.464]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:21:31.464 --> 01:21:37.286]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:21:37.286 --> 01:21:38.926]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:21:38.926 --> 01:21:40.247]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:21:40.247 --> 01:21:42.928]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:21:42.928 --> 01:21:44.348]  He explains everything you need to know.

[01:22:00.063 --> 01:22:06.749]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:22:06.749 --> 01:22:14.857]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:22:14.857 --> 01:22:22.704]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:22:23.024 --> 01:22:28.105]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:22:28.105 --> 01:22:33.327]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:22:33.327 --> 01:22:37.668]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:22:37.668 --> 01:22:38.769]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[01:23:02.096 --> 01:23:02.776]  No kidding!
[01:23:02.776 --> 01:23:07.159]  When you buy Tadler Reusable Canning Lids once, you'll never buy canning lids ever again.
[01:23:07.159 --> 01:23:09.921]  Safely store emergency preparedness foods for years.
[01:23:09.921 --> 01:23:13.384]  Traditional metal lids are single-use throwaways containing BPA.
[01:23:13.384 --> 01:23:18.407]  But Tadler Reusable Canning Lids are guaranteed to last a lifetime when used as design for home canning.
[01:23:18.407 --> 01:23:25.332]  Tadler Lids are made with a USDA and FDA approved food grade plastic, safe for direct food contact, and contain no BPA.
[01:23:25.332 --> 01:23:29.215]  Tadler Lids are dishwasher safe, usable with standard pressure or water bath canning,
[01:23:29.355 --> 01:23:31.456]  Eliminate food spoilage from acid corrosion.
[01:23:31.456 --> 01:23:32.816]  Fit standard mason jars.
[01:23:32.816 --> 01:23:36.177]  Are indefinitely reusable and are proudly made in the USA.
[01:23:36.177 --> 01:23:38.838]  Place orders at ReusableCanningLids.com or call 1-877-747-2793.

[01:23:42.099 --> 01:23:43.039]  The original since 1976.
[01:24:19.414 --> 01:24:25.136]  We're back on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:25.136 --> 01:24:27.697]  France wants new global finance system.
[01:24:27.697 --> 01:24:36.240]  France will help the transition to a global financial system based on several international currencies, the French economy minister said today.
[01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:39.961]  And this is France and China basically calling for the end of the US
[01:24:40.461 --> 01:24:41.102]  We're good to go.
[01:25:09.825 --> 01:25:13.886]  Also, an article that's just gone up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:25:13.886 --> 01:25:21.529]  Obama pencils in $37 billion budget increase for DHS naked body scanners.
[01:25:21.529 --> 01:25:36.753]  The Obama administration is to propose a $37 billion increase in federal spending for the Department of Homeland Security earmarking funds for more radiation-firing naked body scanners in airports around the country.
[01:25:36.753 --> 01:25:39.274]  And don't forget, it's not just in airports anymore.
[01:25:39.754 --> 01:25:51.561]  The truck checkpoints for commercial vehicles at rest stops that have been occurring over the past year or so now being expanded to highways and roads across the nation.
[01:25:51.561 --> 01:26:02.566]  So this is a thumbs up from Obama to Big Sis to continue the excellent job she's been doing in butchering the US Constitution.
[01:26:02.566 --> 01:26:03.127]  Now of course
[01:26:03.667 --> 01:26:19.654]  Napolitano herself gave a speech only last week in which she cited the Portland attempted Christmas tree bombing as a major reason why the DHS needs more money to fight the radical Islamist threat.
[01:26:19.654 --> 01:26:21.875]  Failed to add the fact that
[01:26:22.355 --> 01:26:33.599]  The FBI gave the guy the bomb, the van, the cell phone, radicalised him, and without the federal provocateurs that were involved in the plot, wouldn't have been able to go forward with it.
[01:26:33.599 --> 01:26:46.724]  So again, Big Sis is seizing upon staged, contrived terror plots that the FBI runs in order to get this $37 billion increase in funding from Obama.
[01:26:46.724 --> 01:26:48.565]  Aaron Dykes, your thoughts on that?
[01:26:49.284 --> 01:26:59.410]  Yeah, I'm absolutely disgusted by this, but we already knew they were going to stand down after the public said no to the body scanners back at Thanksgiving time.
[01:26:59.410 --> 01:27:03.812]  Hopefully Bob Barr and them are still going to push that lawsuit forward.
[01:27:03.812 --> 01:27:17.200]  But we saw DHS stand down and supposedly listen to the people saying they didn't want body scanners while they roll it into the Super Bowl and while they announce it's going to go in shopping malls and as you pointed out on the highways and stuff.
[01:27:17.620 --> 01:27:20.742]  And now, of course, there's a bigger budget for naked body scanners.
[01:27:20.742 --> 01:27:22.183]  Why do we need these?
[01:27:22.183 --> 01:27:31.070]  And yes, why aren't they talking about all the cases where it's an FBI contrivance, a sting operation, where they usually give them the bomb?
[01:27:31.070 --> 01:27:31.911]  I don't know what to say.
[01:27:31.911 --> 01:27:33.672]  Why is that never the story?
[01:27:33.672 --> 01:27:35.313]  Why is it always more, more, more?
[01:27:35.313 --> 01:27:38.736]  Of course, it's because it's a continued agenda, but what do you say, Paul?
[01:27:40.134 --> 01:27:53.298]  Well, of course, the naked body scanners, they were implemented after the Christmas Day bombing with a staged underwear bomber who was allowed to get on the plane with the aid of the State Department and the well-dressed man, as we talked about earlier in the show.
[01:27:53.298 --> 01:28:00.621]  And of course, even in that case, the naked body scanners now being used in airports across the world would not have prevented that.
[01:28:01.181 --> 01:28:03.704]  Attempted bombing from taking place.
[01:28:03.704 --> 01:28:21.322]  It's not only the privacy aspect, the fact that the Feds are going to see you and your children naked, it's the fact that these scanners fire off radiation, which the largest radiation safety group on the planet has said could lead to serious health problems.
[01:28:21.322 --> 01:28:21.782]  And indeed,
[01:28:22.803 --> 01:28:46.632]  Napolitano, Big Sis, as well as John Pistoli, the TSA head, routinely lie, Pistoli again just a few days ago in front of Congress, in saying that the Johns Hopkins University has completely validated these body scanners as being safe, when in fact the Johns Hopkins University directly stated that they were a health threat.
[01:28:46.992 --> 01:28:58.515]  And we've written many articles on the fact that every time it comes up, every time Napolitano or Pistoli have to testify about this, they just tell lie after lie after lie.
[01:28:58.515 --> 01:29:14.000]  And it's no surprise that they instantly seize upon these terror plots that the federal government has contrived in order to guarantee this massive federal slush fund, which of course also goes to the private companies that are in on the scam with them.
[01:29:15.100 --> 01:29:17.481]  Yeah, and of course the whole system's turned on its head.
[01:29:17.481 --> 01:29:27.865]  The way to protect us from radical tyrants is to uphold the Fourth Amendment and the rest of the Bill of Rights, not to destroy it and force everyone to be checked.
[01:29:27.865 --> 01:29:33.827]  But, you know, those body scanners were coming into airports before that contrived Christmas Day bombing.
[01:29:33.827 --> 01:29:36.549]  That was a contrived hoax and they already had the plan.
[01:29:36.549 --> 01:29:39.530]  They were already rolling them out and they had already bought them.
[01:29:39.530 --> 01:29:40.030]  That's right.
[01:29:41.843 --> 01:29:44.446]  I'll leave you in the capable hands of Aaron Dykes.
[01:29:44.446 --> 01:29:45.888]  That's me for today.
[01:29:45.888 --> 01:29:47.329]  Stay tuned for the rest of the show.
[01:29:47.329 --> 01:29:49.231]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:29:49.231 --> 01:29:50.873]  Keep watching the live stream.
[01:29:50.873 --> 01:29:52.235]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.235 --> 01:29:53.816]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.816 --> 01:29:57.460]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:02.523 --> 01:30:06.486]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:06.486 --> 01:30:15.353]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:30:15.353 --> 01:30:19.976]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:30:19.976 --> 01:30:30.805]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:30:31.425 --> 01:30:40.928]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:40.928 --> 01:30:46.370]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:30:46.370 --> 01:30:53.853]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:53.853 --> 01:30:56.614]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:31:01.727 --> 01:31:05.748]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:31:05.748 --> 01:31:08.989]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:31:08.989 --> 01:31:13.790]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:31:13.790 --> 01:31:20.171]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:31:20.171 --> 01:31:22.412]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:31:22.952 --> 01:31:23.252]  Tim Geithner?
[01:31:23.252 --> 01:31:23.773]  Bernanke?
[01:31:23.773 --> 01:31:24.433]  They're arsonists!
[01:31:24.433 --> 01:31:25.534]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:31:25.534 --> 01:31:27.975]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:31:41.863 --> 01:31:49.129]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:31:49.129 --> 01:31:58.256]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:32:00.285 --> 01:32:04.848]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:32:04.848 --> 01:32:05.748]  Number 1.
[01:32:05.748 --> 01:32:09.171]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:09.171 --> 01:32:10.051]  Number 2.
[01:32:10.051 --> 01:32:14.934]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:14.934 --> 01:32:15.675]  It's true.
[01:32:15.675 --> 01:32:20.558]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:20.558 --> 01:32:21.378]  Number 3.
[01:32:21.378 --> 01:32:24.961]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:24.961 --> 01:32:28.663]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:28.863 --> 01:32:29.663]  Number 4.
[01:32:29.663 --> 01:32:32.424]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:32.424 --> 01:32:36.105]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:32:36.105 --> 01:32:36.885]  Number 5.
[01:32:36.885 --> 01:32:41.026]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:32:41.026 --> 01:32:46.088]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:32:46.088 --> 01:32:50.269]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:50.269 --> 01:32:52.050]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:52.050 --> 01:32:56.651]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[01:32:56.971 --> 01:32:57.011]  877-327-0365.
[01:33:07.359 --> 01:33:08.120]  We are back.
[01:33:08.120 --> 01:33:10.263]  It is Monday, February 14th.
[01:33:10.263 --> 01:33:11.564]  I'm Aaron Dykes.
[01:33:11.564 --> 01:33:13.066]  I'm in for Alex.
[01:33:13.066 --> 01:33:14.628]  He'll be back tomorrow.
[01:33:28.423 --> 01:33:30.544]  And we just had Paul Watson.
[01:33:30.544 --> 01:33:31.545]  It's good to be on with him.
[01:33:31.545 --> 01:33:34.706]  I want to go through some headlines here.
[01:33:34.706 --> 01:33:38.047]  First, we have a video up on the site, The American Dream.
[01:33:38.047 --> 01:33:44.610]  It's not new, but it's very good, all about how the Federal Reserve is working against our American system.
[01:33:44.610 --> 01:33:47.792]  I added the headline, It's the Bank vs. the Republic.
[01:33:47.792 --> 01:33:56.456]  A really good take on Andrew Jackson vs. the Fed and the early founding fathers' attempt against the Rothschild interests and the other factions there.
[01:33:57.535 --> 01:34:02.862]  Uh, we have CIA Director Leon Panetta warns of a possible cyber Pearl Harbor.
[01:34:02.862 --> 01:34:07.247]  Interesting choice, Pearl Harbor, because we know it'll be a contrived internet attack.
[01:34:07.247 --> 01:34:09.430]  They've already talked about taking over the internet.
[01:34:09.430 --> 01:34:14.496]  They have an internet kill switch in the works and bills to go along with it.
[01:34:15.577 --> 01:34:20.598]  McClatchy, Obama assertion, FBI can get phone records without oversight.
[01:34:20.598 --> 01:34:21.038]  Why not?
[01:34:21.038 --> 01:34:31.800]  They're going to just continue this illegal terrorist operation against the American public, always pretending the threat is greater and greater, but we know who's really behind it.
[01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:36.701]  And of course, if they're going to extend the Patriot Act, why not?
[01:34:36.701 --> 01:34:39.102]  Get FBI phone records without oversight.
[01:34:39.713 --> 01:34:43.838]  Algeria shuts down the internet and Facebook as protests mount.
[01:34:43.838 --> 01:34:49.184]  We've already got into this, but we see the whole Middle East in a supposed uprising.
[01:34:49.184 --> 01:34:55.411]  We're going to keep a close eye on what's really going on there, as Egypt has just been taken over, basically, by the military.
[01:34:57.390 --> 01:34:58.331]  The LA Times.
[01:34:58.331 --> 01:35:01.053]  Los Angeles is getting tough with political protesters.
[01:35:01.053 --> 01:35:06.358]  They want jail time for people blocking the streets and stuff like that.
[01:35:06.358 --> 01:35:09.560]  Let's hope they don't throw away the First Amendment with it.
[01:35:09.560 --> 01:35:10.861]  Swine flu.
[01:35:10.861 --> 01:35:20.649]  The vaccine for swine flu has been linked to a 900% increase in the risk of developing narcolepsy, even though they've told us everyone must take these shots.
[01:35:20.649 --> 01:35:22.391]  They've told us they're safe.
[01:35:22.391 --> 01:35:23.712]  You better think twice about that.
[01:35:24.332 --> 01:35:25.753]  Arizona is suing the U.S.
[01:35:25.753 --> 01:35:29.055]  government for failing to enforce immigration laws.
[01:35:29.055 --> 01:35:34.638]  Jan Brewer, certainly not perfect, but she's been absolutely ridiculed over that.
[01:35:34.638 --> 01:35:39.841]  That the federal government should protect our borders is just a basic part of the Constitution.
[01:35:39.841 --> 01:35:45.304]  Was Judge John Roll the actual target of the Giffords shooting?
[01:35:45.304 --> 01:35:52.929]  That's an article by Ethan A. Huff, really raising questions about if the Tucson shooting
[01:35:53.789 --> 01:35:53.949]  Was
[01:36:13.504 --> 01:36:14.845]  We better hope not.
[01:36:14.845 --> 01:36:28.957]  And David Icke talks about how there has been no revolution thus far in Egypt, for the same reasons we've talked about, that it's been a military-backed coup, a silent coup, ousting Mubarak, and we will see who takes control from there.
[01:36:29.817 --> 01:36:38.263]  I wanted to get more into Dear Glenn Beck, Egypt Destabilization Op hatched by the globalist, not the communist.
[01:36:38.263 --> 01:36:50.330]  And the reason for that title is because the New World Order globalists, who are in power now, have been in power for at least about 100 years in its present form, probably longer.
[01:36:50.330 --> 01:36:55.434]  And everything we've seen going on with geopolitics, including in the Middle East region,
[01:36:56.014 --> 01:37:07.622]  has been controlled by British intelligence and the British Empire designs, which means that they're always using the Hegelian dialectic to play both sides.
[01:37:07.622 --> 01:37:11.405]  They fund an enemy, then they fight against them.
[01:37:11.405 --> 01:37:15.187]  When they replace a dictator, they always have someone new to go in.
[01:37:15.187 --> 01:37:21.752]  And they, most importantly, never want too strong of a leader to stay in power for too long.
[01:37:21.752 --> 01:37:22.853]  You saw this in Egypt.
[01:37:23.713 --> 01:37:32.697]  The whole time, not only has British intelligence been behind the radical elements in that region, they have put in place and taken out the dictators.
[01:37:32.697 --> 01:37:40.321]  The Muslim Brotherhood and the CIA ran out Nasser in the 70s, well in the late 60s and then the 70s.
[01:37:40.321 --> 01:37:43.702]  They challenged his power, then he had to kind of fight for it.
[01:37:43.702 --> 01:37:47.484]  Then we saw Nasser have really a well-timed and suspicious death.
[01:37:48.084 --> 01:37:54.711]  and he's not the only leader uh... but this is all part of the larger british intelligence now american
[01:37:55.712 --> 01:37:58.633]  Great game for geopolitical control.
[01:37:58.633 --> 01:38:08.278]  And in the post-World War II era, you really saw US military forces taking over what had been the British Empire.
[01:38:08.278 --> 01:38:23.506]  The realignment, given the victories of the Allies in World War II, you saw the British convince the US that they need to kind of take over these bases, put bases into place, and make sure they maintain stability over the global
[01:38:24.688 --> 01:38:25.329]  I don't
[01:38:47.008 --> 01:38:55.399]  Through the Middle East, through India, Central Asia, and all the way to the Eastern side of Asia, circling Russia.
[01:38:55.399 --> 01:39:00.886]  And you can see even as the lines pit together, this is a Hegelian dialectic.
[01:39:00.886 --> 01:39:03.930]  It's meant to be order out of chaos, clashing countries.
[01:39:04.791 --> 01:39:08.014]  And it's just really interesting to go back through history.
[01:39:08.014 --> 01:39:13.359]  We have the Cecil Rhodes Roundtable Group, the Secret Societies.
[01:39:13.359 --> 01:39:16.221]  Cecil Rhodes was in South Africa.
[01:39:16.221 --> 01:39:27.491]  And he and his people completely contrived, it used to be four states, and he contrived the wars, used his newspapers to create the clashes, create the conflicts.
[01:39:27.491 --> 01:39:29.473]  They provocated the wars in the middle of the night.
[01:39:29.993 --> 01:39:32.714]  And what they ended up with was South Africa.
[01:39:32.714 --> 01:39:44.398]  But that was just the beginning because Cecil Rhodes, who was a real magnet for the diamond and gold mines and everything else that goes with it, started a secret society.
[01:39:44.398 --> 01:39:45.479]  He left seven wills.
[01:39:45.479 --> 01:39:49.740]  You can read about this in Carol Quigley's Anglo-American Establishment.
[01:39:49.740 --> 01:39:54.102]  And one of the groups he left behind was Alfred Milner's Kindergarten.
[01:39:54.642 --> 01:39:58.703]  And Alfred Milner was down there in South Africa taking part in all this.
[01:39:58.703 --> 01:40:16.490]  But at Oxford, they have an intellectual group of a steering group for the secret society, the same secret society that became the Royal Institute for International Affairs, the Council on Foreign Relations in the US, and the other branches of the International Affairs Institutes in other Western countries.
[01:40:17.350 --> 01:40:33.667]  The reason these groups are important is because they covertly have steered all these nations which used to be under British control and put in place a shadow government, in many cases making these countries feel like they had a true uprising, and the reason I'm bringing this up is to parallel it to Egypt.
[01:40:34.448 --> 01:40:34.548]  I'm
[01:40:50.475 --> 01:40:51.016]  Policies
[01:41:09.352 --> 01:41:11.474]  really steered that whole thing.
[01:41:11.474 --> 01:41:23.323]  The British, who took over India starting in the 1600s and really had gained full control by the mid-1800s, really never lost control even through the Indian independence.
[01:41:23.323 --> 01:41:26.265]  They maintained a shadow government behind them.
[01:41:26.265 --> 01:41:31.108]  And you see this yet again in Lawrence of Arabia, the famous film by David Lean.
[01:41:32.099 --> 01:41:32.479]  T.E.
[01:41:32.479 --> 01:41:51.185]  Lawrence was also part of the Cecil Rhodes Secret Society, and they have played both sides and used an underhanded method to take over these regions, maintain British colonial interest, while giving the local people a sense of their own destiny, a sense of their own leadership.
[01:41:51.185 --> 01:41:53.706]  You can see that in the film, but basically T.E.
[01:41:53.706 --> 01:41:57.747]  Lawrence single-handedly unites the Arabs
[01:41:58.487 --> 01:41:58.828]  I don't know.
[01:42:13.806 --> 01:42:19.289]  Now I wanted to play a clip from The Man Who Would Be King, a 1979 movie.
[01:42:19.289 --> 01:42:24.793]  It's based on the Rudyard Kipling short story by the same name, The Man Who Would Be King.
[01:42:24.793 --> 01:42:31.697]  Rudyard Kipling was born in India and has been a very large proponent of the British colonial system.
[01:42:31.697 --> 01:42:35.279]  He sort of acknowledged that we were passing the torch to the U.S.
[01:42:35.279 --> 01:42:37.921]  and that they would be taking over the empire.
[01:42:37.921 --> 01:42:42.864]  You know, Rudyard Kipling was the architect of the white man's burden.
[01:42:43.824 --> 01:43:02.018]  uh... paradigm where basically defending that white white or anglo-colonial interest should take over these uh... far-reaching parts of the world and influence their affairs because it's just better to do that uh... if we could queue up that clip, I hope they have it ready.
[01:43:04.758 --> 01:43:06.999]  This will show you how they play both sides.
[01:43:06.999 --> 01:43:13.823]  They're going to take over a corrupt dictator and really have a plan to take over for their own means.
[01:43:13.823 --> 01:43:17.684]  These are two British Masonic soldiers from The Man Who Would Be King.
[01:43:17.684 --> 01:43:18.385]  Roll it.
[01:43:18.385 --> 01:43:22.487]  We're not little men, so we're going away to be kings.
[01:43:22.487 --> 01:43:24.568]  Kings of Cafferistown.
[01:43:24.568 --> 01:43:26.109]  Oh, Cafferistown.
[01:43:26.109 --> 01:43:28.590]  We hear they have two-and-thirty idols there.
[01:43:28.590 --> 01:43:30.471]  So we'll be a thirty-third and thirty-fourth.
[01:43:31.755 --> 01:43:35.776]  It's a place of warring tribes, which is to say, a land of opportunity.
[01:43:35.776 --> 01:43:39.737]  It's a place of warring tribes, that is to say, a land of opportunity.
[01:43:39.737 --> 01:43:44.778]  We'll go there, we'll say to any chief we can find, do you want to vanquish your foes?
[01:43:44.778 --> 01:43:47.279]  Of course he'll say, go to it.
[01:43:47.279 --> 01:43:51.440]  We'll fight for him, make him king, then we'll subvert that king.
[01:43:51.440 --> 01:43:55.400]  We'll seize his royal throne, and loot the country four ways from Sunday.
[01:43:55.400 --> 01:43:56.421]  How's that for a plan?
[01:43:56.421 --> 01:43:57.001]  Hold it right there.
[01:43:58.826 --> 01:44:04.088]  So you see, they're going to approach the local dictator, approach the local king.
[01:44:04.088 --> 01:44:06.149]  They're going to tell him, do you want to vanquish your foes?
[01:44:06.149 --> 01:44:07.570]  We'll fight your enemies for you.
[01:44:07.570 --> 01:44:09.791]  This is classic Hegelian dialectic.
[01:44:09.791 --> 01:44:13.333]  This is how the British Empire has worked for literally hundreds of years.
[01:44:13.333 --> 01:44:15.113]  This takes place, of course, back in the mid-1800s.
[01:44:16.514 --> 01:44:20.615]  But it's not that much different of a game today, even in the Middle East.
[01:44:20.615 --> 01:44:26.096]  This is...Kafiristan is in a region, basically, part of modern-day Afghanistan.
[01:44:26.096 --> 01:44:31.317]  And you see, they're going to bribe the local dictators by fighting his enemies, only to later loot him.
[01:44:31.317 --> 01:44:31.977]  Continue, please.
[01:44:31.977 --> 01:44:34.037]  He wants to know, are you gods?
[01:44:34.037 --> 01:44:35.078]  Not gods.
[01:44:35.078 --> 01:44:35.818]  Englishmen.
[01:44:35.818 --> 01:44:37.198]  Which is the next best thing.
[01:44:37.198 --> 01:44:38.718]  La avatar, la devta.
[01:44:38.718 --> 01:44:39.758]  Goroshav!
[01:44:39.758 --> 01:44:42.299]  Bringing enlightenment to the darker regions of the Earth.
[01:44:42.895 --> 01:44:45.878]  That's the white man's burden.
[01:44:45.878 --> 01:44:50.441]  He wants to know how a rifle works.
[01:44:50.441 --> 01:44:54.825]  Show him, Peachy.
[01:44:54.825 --> 01:44:58.368]  The power of the rifle.
[01:44:58.368 --> 01:45:03.693]  We are not gods exactly, but we are heaven sent to deliver you from your enemies.
[01:45:04.262 --> 01:45:06.424]  The enemy is all around.
[01:45:06.424 --> 01:45:07.385]  The Bashkai are the worst.
[01:45:07.385 --> 01:45:09.447]  Okay, hold on right there.
[01:45:19.966 --> 01:45:22.488]  Okay, so again you see this local dictator.
[01:45:22.488 --> 01:45:31.193]  They've shown him the power of their firearms and said, you know, being Englishman is almost the next thing to being God, and they're going to fight their foes for him.
[01:45:31.193 --> 01:45:34.015]  That's when this local tribal king breaks down.
[01:45:34.015 --> 01:45:35.616]  He says, enemies?
[01:45:35.616 --> 01:45:37.057]  I have enemies all around.
[01:45:37.057 --> 01:45:38.919]  Anything you could do to help me.
[01:45:38.919 --> 01:45:45.183]  Go on as they use his ego to win over this local dictator so they can play both sides for greater British control.
[01:45:47.799 --> 01:45:52.363]  He says he'll give you two goats for each Bashkai man you're killing.
[01:45:52.363 --> 01:45:53.404]  A handsome offer.
[01:45:53.404 --> 01:45:58.069]  But rather than knocking him over one at a time, we'd like to do the whole thing in one fell swoop.
[01:45:58.069 --> 01:45:59.851]  Serve him up a proper victory.
[01:45:59.851 --> 01:46:01.713]  Storm Bashkai, take the city.
[01:46:08.135 --> 01:46:09.916]  He says, how much for all that?
[01:46:09.916 --> 01:46:16.117]  Only the honor of leading the brave men of Urheb into battle.
[01:46:16.117 --> 01:46:18.838]  Plus whatever we may fancy in the way of souvenirs.
[01:46:18.838 --> 01:46:23.759]  Looting the country.
[01:46:23.759 --> 01:46:25.560]  Baskai is only the beginning.
[01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:29.281]  We hope to go on from victory to victory until he runs out of enemies.
[01:46:31.842 --> 01:46:33.703]  And a monarch of all you should be.
[01:46:33.703 --> 01:46:45.328]  From the highest place in the valley, Uta the Great.
[01:46:45.328 --> 01:46:49.830]  Oh, he says he prefers Uta the Terrible.
[01:46:49.830 --> 01:46:52.331]  Then Uta the Terrible it shall be.
[01:46:53.872 --> 01:46:54.092]  I think
[01:47:11.770 --> 01:47:34.261]  Playing two sides against each other to control the region and I think in many ways this is what we're still seeing today in the Middle East region only now it's not just the British it's also American interest it's Israeli interest but they're all combined it's the New World Order interest and just because Glenn Beck talks about left-leaning socialist elements in this
[01:47:34.901 --> 01:47:59.796]  in the system doesn't mean it isn't still the military interests who are calling who gets to be a dictator letting them feel powerful they're gonna be Utah the terrible but really who's in control will remain the US British allied interests and that's very interesting to see because it's just the Brzezinski great game is the Kissinger great game it is the way they played out communist containment
[01:48:00.436 --> 01:48:00.877]  Thank you for
[01:48:17.897 --> 01:48:28.948]  The populations in Egypt will have a true revolution and will not fall into greater radicalism and that they will have true elections and be able to appoint their own leaders.
[01:48:28.948 --> 01:48:33.873]  But we know how much of history has gone and it's just very startling to see that game.
[01:48:35.675 --> 01:48:38.578]  When we come back from break, I want to talk more about Ron Paul.
[01:48:38.578 --> 01:48:44.182]  He just gave a great speech where he says we shouldn't back up dictators anymore.
[01:48:44.182 --> 01:48:46.665]  Part of his larger theme of bringing home the U.S.
[01:48:46.665 --> 01:48:56.053]  Empire, part of the larger theme of not giving foreign aid to all these countries, only to finance dictators and have them not be our friends later.
[01:48:56.053 --> 01:48:57.654]  And I think it's a great strategy.
[01:48:57.654 --> 01:48:59.696]  It's very important.
[01:48:59.696 --> 01:49:03.079]  In fact, maybe we should start that clip now and then we'll come back from break with it.
[01:49:03.649 --> 01:49:06.972]  Joining us is Republican Congressman Ron Paul of Texas.
[01:49:06.972 --> 01:49:11.755]  He's joining us now from the Conservative Political Action Conference here in Washington.
[01:49:11.755 --> 01:49:13.877]  Congressman Paul, thanks very much for joining us.
[01:49:13.877 --> 01:49:16.999]  Let's talk about Egypt, a subject you know quite a bit about.
[01:49:16.999 --> 01:49:19.701]  You've said controversial remarks.
[01:49:19.701 --> 01:49:24.385]  He said Egypt is the United States' 30-year mistake.
[01:49:24.385 --> 01:49:25.406]  What were you referring to?
[01:49:27.776 --> 01:49:33.240]  Well, we've invested a lot of money into Mubarak, and I don't think it was a good investment.
[01:49:33.240 --> 01:49:38.945]  It was stable for a while, but it was building the resentment and the instability that finally burst out.
[01:49:38.945 --> 01:49:48.472]  So I would say the $70 billion was not worth it, and that, unfortunately, many of those dollars ended up in Swiss bank accounts for his family.
[01:49:48.472 --> 01:49:56.138]  So I think it was a big mistake, and we really don't have the money to spare, and I don't think it does anything for our national security.
[01:49:56.838 --> 01:50:00.523]  So if you had your way, the billion and a half dollars a year that the U.S.
[01:50:00.523 --> 01:50:10.237]  provides Egypt in military, mostly military, about 1.3 billion, about another 200 million dollars in economic assistance, if you had your way, all of that would be gone immediately?
[01:50:10.237 --> 01:50:10.878]  Is that what you're saying?
[01:50:13.143 --> 01:50:14.404]  Oh yeah, I think so.
[01:50:14.404 --> 01:50:16.965]  I mean, I'm not a believer in foreign aid.
[01:50:16.965 --> 01:50:19.446]  And you know, I sort of liked what Eisenhower did in 1956.
[01:50:19.446 --> 01:50:33.273]  I was a college student then, had remembered the Korean War, and when the British and the French were attacked by the Egyptians to take the canal, and they went to Eisenhower, and Eisenhower said, I don't want to have anything to do with it.
[01:50:33.513 --> 01:50:37.514]  So I think that was good advice and that's probably the way we should have stayed that way.
[01:50:37.514 --> 01:50:44.597]  And we should do a lot less, a lot sooner and not waste all this money because it tends to come back to haunt us.
[01:50:44.597 --> 01:50:47.738]  It reminds me a little bit about propping up the Shah of Iran.
[01:50:47.738 --> 01:50:48.759]  Just look at that problem.
[01:50:48.759 --> 01:50:50.719]  Then we ended up with the Ayatollah.
[01:50:50.719 --> 01:50:52.600]  So they're not good investments.
[01:50:52.600 --> 01:50:54.901]  I like the founder's advice.
[01:50:54.901 --> 01:50:59.343]  You know, be friends with people and trade with people and negotiate and get along.
[01:51:01.038 --> 01:51:02.339]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.339 --> 01:51:07.922]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.922 --> 01:51:12.945]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:12.945 --> 01:51:18.508]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:51:18.508 --> 01:51:20.349]  So our friends at Solutions from Science
[01:51:20.609 --> 01:51:21.109]  We're good to go!

[01:54:08.349 --> 01:54:09.810]  The guy that we can support.
[01:54:09.810 --> 01:54:14.674]  Because most of them now have expressed, well, we can't really give them democracy.
[01:54:14.674 --> 01:54:16.535]  They might elect the wrong person.
[01:54:16.535 --> 01:54:19.897]  See, we're all for democracy as long as they pick the right person.
[01:54:19.897 --> 01:54:24.621]  And we just as soon prefer a dictator that will do our bidding and then we give them a lot of money.
[01:54:24.621 --> 01:54:25.982]  I'd like another option.
[01:54:25.982 --> 01:54:33.187]  Rather than either just bombing people or giving them money, I would say friendship and diplomacy is a much better way to go.
[01:54:33.647 --> 01:54:37.972]  I mean, this army was built by us, and the military-industrial complex loved it.
[01:54:37.972 --> 01:54:39.434]  They made a lot of money off that.
[01:54:39.434 --> 01:54:43.178]  But the army was there to, for all those 30 years, was to protect Mubarak.
[01:54:43.178 --> 01:54:45.421]  It wasn't for national defense purposes.
[01:54:45.421 --> 01:54:46.382]  So that's our army.
[01:54:46.382 --> 01:54:49.165]  450,000 troops that we more or less was...
[01:54:50.402 --> 01:55:10.555]  I was just going to say, administration officials, going back to Republican administrations, whether Bush or Reagan or Democratic administrations, the current one, or Bill Clinton's administration, they'll argue this military assistance to Egypt is a good investment in the United States because Egypt was an ally, a strategic partner, and cooperated with the U.S.
[01:55:10.555 --> 01:55:13.817]  in the war on terror, for example, so this was money well spent.
[01:55:13.817 --> 01:55:16.638]  That's the argument we've heard now for 30 years.
[01:55:16.638 --> 01:55:17.059]  Well, yeah.
[01:55:18.373 --> 01:55:20.474]  But I think our current events proved my point.
[01:55:20.474 --> 01:55:28.300]  It wasn't well spent, because it ended up in chaos, and we don't know who the next dictator is going to be, and it helped contribute to our bankruptcy.
[01:55:28.300 --> 01:55:41.149]  So I would say... Maybe the next leader of Egypt will... But if the next leader of Egypt, Congressman, is a democratically elected leader, popular, and doing all the right things, there wouldn't necessarily be a dictator.
[01:55:41.149 --> 01:55:43.951]  Why do we have to assume the next leader of Egypt is going to be a dictator?
[01:55:46.004 --> 01:55:55.726]  That would be great, but I personally believe that the odds of that happening are much better if we're not there picking up and picking the individuals to spend our money on it.
[01:55:55.726 --> 01:56:01.387]  So I'm for that, I just don't believe that the best way to do is get in there and finance the military.
[01:56:01.387 --> 01:56:07.409]  The military right now, of course, is dependent on us, and the military's in charge, so we really own the country right now.
[01:56:07.409 --> 01:56:08.389]  Alright, let's stop it right there.
[01:56:09.645 --> 01:56:13.408]  Okay, that is Ron Paul very hopefully talking.
[01:56:13.408 --> 01:56:22.614]  It's very hopeful to me, rather, that they can finally talk about cutting military spending, bringing home the troops, ending this overseas foreign empire.
[01:56:22.614 --> 01:56:33.401]  And the conservative movement at CPAC really has shown that they're behind Ron Paul on this, and they see through the neocon game, and they've had enough of the Cheney and Rumsfeld types.
[01:56:33.401 --> 01:56:38.004]  I've just gotten word that We Are Change has confronted Dick Cheney.
[01:56:38.004 --> 01:56:39.325]  You can look for that tomorrow.
[01:56:39.885 --> 01:56:53.793]  But for today, we can really hope that we won't continue to destabilize the region to fund these dictators and to fund supposedly democratic movements only to see them go astray.
[01:56:53.793 --> 01:57:00.557]  It's very good that we're talking about bringing ourselves back to a nation-based, constitution-based system.
[01:57:01.617 --> 01:57:07.779]  And I'm just excited to see Ron Paul talking about that and that issue being on the table.
[01:57:07.779 --> 01:57:14.380]  If you go to GCN Live, you can read, terrorists who trained London bombers was working for US government.
[01:57:14.380 --> 01:57:22.322]  More evidence that the 7-7 plot was just another case of FBI MI6 intelligence provocateuring.
[01:57:22.322 --> 01:57:24.543]  Sting operations where they give them the bombs.
[01:57:25.243 --> 01:57:28.689]  It's disgusting the way this war on terror is supposed to continue.
[01:57:28.689 --> 01:57:33.516]  That we're supposed to clamp down at home and continue foaming in chaos overseas.
[01:57:33.516 --> 01:57:37.301]  It's probably not a good long-term strategy for true U.S.
[01:57:37.301 --> 01:57:40.306]  dominance and I think we'd be wise to reconsider that.
[01:57:43.851 --> 01:57:50.155]  You can also read Dear Glenn Beck, Egypt destabilization op hatched by globalists, not communists.
[01:57:50.155 --> 01:57:53.337]  I think it's one of Alex's most powerful videos.
[01:57:53.337 --> 01:57:59.320]  It's up on the Alex Jones channel on YouTube, and it can be found on our websites.

[01:58:50.797 --> 01:58:51.977]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:58:51.977 --> 01:58:58.901]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:58:58.901 --> 01:59:01.442]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:59:01.442 --> 01:59:06.845]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:59:06.845 --> 01:59:09.887]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:59:09.887 --> 01:59:11.948]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:59:12.188 --> 01:59:18.433]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:59:18.433 --> 01:59:21.815]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:59:21.815 --> 01:59:27.599]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:59:27.599 --> 01:59:29.240]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:59:29.240 --> 01:59:30.541]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:59:30.541 --> 01:59:33.223]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:59:33.223 --> 01:59:37.446]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:59:37.446 --> 01:59:39.468]  You can find the video at www.
[01:59:40.228 --> 01:59:42.049]  End of America 3 dot com.
[01:59:42.049 --> 01:59:43.170]  That's End of America.

[01:59:56.200 --> 01:59:58.982]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.134 --> 02:00:09.977]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:09.977 --> 02:00:11.557]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.557 --> 02:00:13.098]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.098 --> 02:00:17.301]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.301 --> 02:00:21.343]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.638 --> 02:00:27.063]  Well, for the next 30 minutes, Ray McGovern is our guest.
[02:00:27.063 --> 02:00:28.165]  We're going to talk about Egypt.
[02:00:28.165 --> 02:00:32.131]  We're going to talk about the big news out of the Times of India and other publications.
[02:00:32.131 --> 02:00:35.035]  Bush fears arrest, perhaps Swiss visit.
[02:00:35.035 --> 02:00:38.740]  It's funny, we were talking about this last night before I saw this news article this morning.
[02:00:40.205 --> 02:00:40.445]  I think so.
[02:01:02.216 --> 02:01:03.257]  Thanks Alex.
[02:01:17.202 --> 02:01:20.404]  Well Alex, there's an elephant in that living room.
[02:01:47.273 --> 02:01:50.458]  And the name of the elephant is Israel.
[02:01:50.458 --> 02:01:56.546]  And surprise, surprise, no one in this country is talking about it.
[02:01:56.546 --> 02:02:02.353]  This is an incredible blow, not only to the United States, but to Israel.
[02:02:02.353 --> 02:02:03.275]  They had depended.
[02:02:04.159 --> 02:02:12.701]  On having a very safe frontier with Egypt since the accord where Egypt recognized Israel.
[02:02:12.701 --> 02:02:13.901]  And that's a long time ago.
[02:02:13.901 --> 02:02:15.802]  And they had taken it for granted.
[02:02:15.802 --> 02:02:23.423]  And all of a sudden, whoa, their strategic calculations are upset by this popular revolt in Egypt.
[02:02:23.423 --> 02:02:26.764]  So the real question is, what will the Israelis do?
[02:02:28.112 --> 02:02:30.034]  No.
[02:02:30.034 --> 02:02:32.077]  You know, people say, well, they can't do anything.
[02:02:32.077 --> 02:02:34.019]  They'll sit back and watch what happens.
[02:02:34.019 --> 02:02:34.319]  Right.
[02:02:34.319 --> 02:02:38.143]  That's not the way they operate.
[02:02:38.143 --> 02:02:44.771]  Number one, they'll operate through their, well, how shall I say, their supporters here in the United States.
[02:02:45.431 --> 02:03:01.597]  And this is one main reason why Hillary Clinton and our President have been waffling for the last week or ten days, not knowing whether to say, you know, Barks needs to get out or, oh, maybe you can deal with this Vice President who is a well-known torturer.
[02:03:01.597 --> 02:03:04.658]  You know, it's really been painful watching
[02:03:04.858 --> 02:03:06.959]  The two's and fro's and the unspoken.
[02:03:06.959 --> 02:03:27.385]  The factor that can never be spoken on mainline TV is what this means to the Israelis and how Israeli supporters in this country are putting the screws on Barack Obama again to make sure that he doesn't do anything that will make that part of the world still riskier for Israel.
[02:03:28.157 --> 02:03:28.917]  And now the L.A.
[02:03:28.917 --> 02:03:30.518]  Times reports a bunch of U.S.
[02:03:30.518 --> 02:03:34.560]  ships are steaming into the area.
[02:03:34.560 --> 02:03:40.623]  And on top of that, we're getting reports that Marines are being deployed into Egypt.
[02:03:40.623 --> 02:03:41.904]  They claim for evacuations.
[02:03:41.904 --> 02:03:42.444]  Do you buy that?
[02:03:44.822 --> 02:03:46.403]  No, I don't buy that.
[02:03:46.403 --> 02:03:51.407]  I think the Marines want to be prepared to follow orders as they always do.
[02:03:51.407 --> 02:03:54.129]  I don't think that the U.S.
[02:03:54.129 --> 02:03:55.830]  personages are in any danger.
[02:03:55.830 --> 02:04:03.156]  They may be back up at the airport, but none of the protesters have said they're going to do any harm to U.S.
[02:04:03.156 --> 02:04:05.438]  officials or tourists who remain there.
[02:04:05.438 --> 02:04:06.999]  So this is a pretty ominous thing.
[02:04:06.999 --> 02:04:11.042]  I hadn't gotten confirmation about these Marine moves, but that's what Marines do.
[02:04:11.762 --> 02:04:25.253]  And if Mubarak decides to make a last stand, he'll be supported not only by Marines from our country, but by all manner of support from Israel, which knows how to do this, by the way, and are only a stone's throw away.
[02:04:25.253 --> 02:04:36.623]  Well, we've had the British go into Suez in the past, and it is the Business Insider reporting on the Marine situation, but if they admit they're sending ships, would Marines go along with that?
[02:04:36.623 --> 02:04:37.644]  And that's who comes off the ships.
[02:04:38.288 --> 02:04:40.070]  Yeah, it depends on what kind of ships, of course.
[02:04:40.070 --> 02:04:47.658]  They can always justify the ships by ostensible danger to the Suez Canal.
[02:04:47.658 --> 02:04:53.785]  We'll have to see how that plays out, because I don't think the administration here knows what it's doing.
[02:04:53.785 --> 02:04:54.466]  Right, stay there.
[02:04:54.466 --> 02:04:57.990]  Let's finish up with Egypt, then get into Bush arrest fears.
[02:05:01.135 --> 02:05:04.718]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[02:05:04.718 --> 02:05:05.839]  It ended on June of 2009.
[02:05:05.839 --> 02:05:10.402]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[02:05:10.402 --> 02:05:16.347]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[02:05:16.347 --> 02:05:18.509]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[02:05:18.509 --> 02:05:21.171]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[02:05:21.531 --> 02:05:28.035]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[02:05:28.035 --> 02:05:30.236]  They both make fabulous investments.
[02:05:30.236 --> 02:05:35.579]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[02:05:35.579 --> 02:05:40.862]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[02:05:40.862 --> 02:05:46.225]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[02:05:46.225 --> 02:05:47.326]  This will freeze the cost
[02:05:47.366 --> 02:05:47.666]  That's it!
[02:06:03.567 --> 02:06:04.587]  Police, action!
[02:06:04.587 --> 02:06:05.848]  Tyranny is here.
[02:06:05.848 --> 02:06:09.769]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:06:09.769 --> 02:06:12.009]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:06:12.009 --> 02:06:17.870]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:06:17.870 --> 02:06:24.112]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:06:24.532 --> 02:06:30.494]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:06:30.494 --> 02:06:34.695]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:06:34.695 --> 02:06:38.976]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:06:38.976 --> 02:06:44.938]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[02:06:44.938 --> 02:06:48.499]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:06:48.499 --> 02:06:50.460]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:06:50.460 --> 02:06:50.900]  It's here.

[02:07:00.219 --> 02:07:04.061]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[02:07:04.061 --> 02:07:08.342]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[02:07:08.342 --> 02:07:13.144]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[02:07:13.144 --> 02:07:18.967]  Not looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[02:07:18.967 --> 02:07:26.110]  Not worried about them moving south, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[02:07:28.747 --> 02:07:34.290]  I'm looking for America.
[02:07:34.290 --> 02:07:35.911]  We're American and be proud.
[02:07:35.911 --> 02:07:38.532]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[02:07:38.532 --> 02:07:43.155]  The land I left free and the home of the brave.
[02:07:43.155 --> 02:07:48.258]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[02:07:54.716 --> 02:07:59.281]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[02:08:02.139 --> 02:08:08.763]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:08.763 --> 02:08:12.766]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:12.766 --> 02:08:18.570]  That's right, the United States has been captured by big offshore corporations that are totally ruthless.
[02:08:18.570 --> 02:08:28.897]  All over the world, these multinationals have funded dictatorships, corrupt bureaucracies to basically feed on top of their populations.
[02:08:28.897 --> 02:08:31.679]  And the people are rebelling in Egypt.
[02:08:32.579 --> 02:08:47.686]  The establishment obviously recognized that and has said that they are funding the opposition, I guess, so they are still in control if Hosni Mubarak is forced out sooner than September.
[02:08:47.686 --> 02:08:51.989]  And Ray McGovern, of course, top CIA analyst to Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr.
[02:08:53.934 --> 02:09:02.099]  He was also in the military during the Vietnam War, and we always appreciate him joining us.
[02:09:02.099 --> 02:09:05.000]  He's made a lot of really accurate predictions.
[02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:16.527]  I remember about a year and a half before it happened, he said, well, I would look for Cheney and the neocons to try to stage a Gulf of Tonkin situation to get into war with Iran.
[02:09:17.387 --> 02:09:25.109]  Then about a year later that happened and then a year after that we learned that it had been a staged event.
[02:09:25.109 --> 02:09:44.715]  So just amazing and so we need to listen up when he tells us what he thinks is really going on in Egypt and where he thinks the situation is going, what's happening with these pipelines going, these gas pipelines into Jordan and Israel being blown up, what the overall geopolitical ramifications are and not just briefing presidents, he's now briefing us.
[02:09:44.715 --> 02:09:46.196]  Tell us again what's going on in Egypt.
[02:09:48.120 --> 02:09:51.742]  Well, Alex, it's very, very complicated.
[02:09:51.742 --> 02:10:07.070]  The main factor really is that the broad public support of the revolutionaries or the uprising people are numerous, but they seem to lack coherent leadership.
[02:10:07.070 --> 02:10:15.855]  The only bright light there is ElBaradei, the former chief UN inspector, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency,
[02:10:16.627 --> 02:10:28.793]  Who has wide respect abroad as well as in Egypt, a reluctant draftee, so to speak, but he has said that he would be willing to lead now and form an interim government.
[02:10:28.793 --> 02:10:30.053]  So that's the good news.
[02:10:30.053 --> 02:10:36.516]  The bad news, of course, is that for Israel and the United States, El Baradei is poison.
[02:10:36.516 --> 02:10:37.737]  Why?
[02:10:37.737 --> 02:10:41.899]  Because, oddly, this statesman insists on telling the truth.
[02:10:42.799 --> 02:10:49.001]  He was the one that has said all along that there is no real evidence that Iran is working on a nuclear weapon.
[02:10:49.001 --> 02:10:50.162]  And he should know!
[02:10:50.162 --> 02:10:53.283]  His inspectors are crawling all over that country.
[02:10:53.283 --> 02:11:08.548]  And he was the one, you may recall, back in March or April of 2003, who testified, I was watching it live, I'll never forget it, testified before the UN Security Council and said, you know those reports?
[02:11:09.551 --> 02:11:16.594]  Those reports said that Iraq was seeking a Yolocake uranium from Niger.
[02:11:16.594 --> 02:11:23.997]  We have looked into it and in two days we found that they are not authentic.
[02:11:23.997 --> 02:11:25.417]  They were forgeries!
[02:11:25.417 --> 02:11:28.398]  Forgeries by, I think, Dick Cheney's folks.
[02:11:28.398 --> 02:11:30.059]  So, the guy is poisoned.
[02:11:30.059 --> 02:11:30.499]  The U.S.
[02:11:30.499 --> 02:11:34.941]  tried to get him removed from his post in the IAEA without success.
[02:11:34.941 --> 02:11:36.041]  So where did that leave us?
[02:11:36.041 --> 02:11:37.322]  Well, that leaves us with a
[02:11:38.162 --> 02:11:51.032]  With a very fearful Israel, stoking up fears in the United States about these Muslims, you know, these Muslim terrorists that could take over Cairo, which is a red herring.
[02:11:51.032 --> 02:11:52.993]  They're never going to do that in Egypt.
[02:11:52.993 --> 02:11:55.635]  Egypt is a country of 80 million people.
[02:11:55.635 --> 02:11:57.717]  You know, the rest is small fry.
[02:11:57.717 --> 02:11:58.818]  Egypt is so big.
[02:11:59.358 --> 02:12:03.699]  That Israel, I think, will have to determine what it's going to do.
[02:12:03.699 --> 02:12:11.981]  And what it's going to do frightens me, because it has all kinds of possibilities, including... Well, let me put it this way, Alex.
[02:12:11.981 --> 02:12:21.483]  If I were ElBaradei, I would insist on a whole platoon of soldiers and bodyguards around me, rather than just the ten that exist now.
[02:12:22.850 --> 02:12:37.287]  Now, Ray, what's the stratagem of disinformation then, having the AP, the London Telegraph, come out and say that the US is behind Alberti and basically triggered this?
[02:12:37.287 --> 02:12:38.028]  Is that an attempt
[02:12:38.789 --> 02:12:59.793]  Knowing that if the West and Israel claim that Alberti somehow works for them, that that will discredit him at home in a country tired of foreign domination through the propped-up dictator, Hazem Mubarak, who Cheney is calling a great guy and a good man who we should respect.
[02:13:00.433 --> 02:13:08.067]  Yeah, Alex, if I were, you know, giving references for a job, I don't think I'd include Dick Cheney on my reference list.
[02:13:08.067 --> 02:13:09.970]  Yeah, that speaks volumes, doesn't it?
[02:13:09.970 --> 02:13:11.272]  Cheney thinks he's a great guy.
[02:13:13.446 --> 02:13:17.991]  Your initial point was having to do with the... I forget now.
[02:13:17.991 --> 02:13:21.195]  Well, no, I mean, the media is... Oh, the media, yeah.
[02:13:21.195 --> 02:13:24.278]  They're claiming that Alberti is backed by the U.S.
[02:13:24.278 --> 02:13:30.485]  Yeah, well, you know, there's all kinds of disinformation campaigns out there to discredit somebody like Baradei.
[02:13:31.506 --> 02:13:45.018]  And you can be sure that we have our, quote, assets, end quote, in some of the more conservative newspapers and magazines in Britain and elsewhere, and so you can expect them to sow all kinds of confusion.
[02:13:45.018 --> 02:13:51.384]  The Egyptian people know what Barad-Dai is and what he isn't, and that's what counts here.
[02:13:51.384 --> 02:13:54.467]  The only problem is getting organized to the point where they
[02:13:54.907 --> 02:14:07.895]  They can actually face into the new Vice President named by Mubarak, who by the way is the CIA and Israeli checkpoint, their liaison guy.
[02:14:07.895 --> 02:14:12.118]  Not only that, but he was the fellow in Egypt that handled the
[02:14:14.080 --> 02:14:18.823]  Uh, the transfer of people that we wanted to get tortured.
[02:14:18.823 --> 02:14:21.385]  Uh, renditions is what we call it.
[02:14:21.385 --> 02:14:23.347]  Uh, kind of a nice sobriquet.
[02:14:23.347 --> 02:14:25.248]  Uh, yeah, renditions.
[02:14:25.248 --> 02:14:29.371]  And there was one particularly flagrant rendition.
[02:14:29.371 --> 02:14:32.294]  Uh, and this is worth recalling to mind.
[02:14:33.171 --> 02:14:33.271]  It's
[02:14:46.411 --> 02:14:48.312]  Yeah, and the fake airplanes.
[02:14:48.312 --> 02:14:50.554]  It turned out none of that was true.
[02:15:10.689 --> 02:15:11.390]  Yeah, right.
[02:15:11.390 --> 02:15:17.233]  So, he got alibi and he won't, quote, confess, end quote.
[02:15:17.233 --> 02:15:25.719]  And so they take him to, they send him off to al-Suleiman, the current Egyptian Vice President.
[02:15:25.719 --> 02:15:29.462]  And they say, you know, you guys are better at this than we are.
[02:15:29.462 --> 02:15:32.504]  What we need to do is make sure we find out that
[02:15:33.775 --> 02:15:40.897]  Saddam Hussein was training Al Qaeda operatives, and Alibi knew that because he was running the travel agency.
[02:15:40.897 --> 02:15:42.317]  And guess what, Alex?
[02:15:42.317 --> 02:15:43.738]  You'll never guess what.
[02:15:43.738 --> 02:15:47.619]  But the Egyptians succeeded in doing that.
[02:15:47.619 --> 02:15:50.620]  The cable went back to Washington.
[02:15:50.620 --> 02:15:58.742]  The next day, the President, the Vice President, and later Colin Powell before the UN, spun this tale as proof.
[02:15:59.842 --> 02:16:13.407]  And that is only one of the thousands of admitted crimes and lies and deception.
[02:16:13.407 --> 02:16:19.930]  Shifting gears, because we don't have a lot of time left with you, Ray, let's go back to who was involved at this time.
[02:16:19.930 --> 02:16:27.813]  Bush, Cheney, Karl Rove, the architect, Alberto Gonzalez, putting out memos that they could torture people, including crushing children's
[02:16:28.633 --> 02:16:29.094]  I don't know.
[02:16:38.735 --> 02:16:44.318]  There have been calls for at least Karl Rove or Alberto Gonzalez or John Yoo to be brought up on war crimes.
[02:16:44.318 --> 02:16:49.680]  But now we have the Times of India and other publications reporting Bush fears arrest scraps Swiss visit.
[02:16:49.680 --> 02:16:56.423]  He was set to give a keynote address and had agreed to do it, has now canceled the February 12th speech.
[02:16:56.423 --> 02:17:05.167]  Before we get into this, recapping the international admitted crimes that were committed here, the lies of WMDs, the Downing Street memo, the White House memo.
[02:17:05.167 --> 02:17:07.268]  I was at a restaurant last night and Karl Rove
[02:17:07.828 --> 02:17:08.389]  We're good to go.
[02:17:22.256 --> 02:17:26.698]  Well, what I would have done, Alex, is call Code Pink right quick.
[02:17:26.698 --> 02:17:29.280]  They have handcuffs and they have courage.
[02:17:29.280 --> 02:17:32.482]  The courage that continues to amaze me.
[02:17:32.482 --> 02:17:42.107]  They have tried to arrest him at his book signings and what needs to happen is somebody needs to put the cuffs on him because he can be extradited and subjected to justice.
[02:17:42.107 --> 02:17:44.088]  Our government doesn't have the guts to do it.
[02:17:44.488 --> 02:17:45.749]  But the Spaniards?
[02:17:45.749 --> 02:17:46.669]  The French?
[02:17:46.669 --> 02:17:47.650]  The Germans?
[02:17:47.650 --> 02:18:06.440]  They all may, under the principle of universal jurisdiction, which briefly means that if the government who is harboring these criminals is unwilling to proceed against them in a legal fashion, then under the Convention Against Torture, any government can initiate judicial proceedings.
[02:18:06.440 --> 02:18:11.003]  Now that's why George Bush, and this is really amazing, we have word late Friday night,
[02:18:11.898 --> 02:18:18.166]  That George Bush had cancelled out of this appearance in Geneva scheduled for February 12th.
[02:18:18.166 --> 02:18:25.716]  And we learned from the Center for Constitutional Rights that they and their European counterparts had assembled 2,500 pages worth of indictment.
[02:18:28.599 --> 02:18:30.520]  Hold on, you're separately here on air.
[02:18:30.520 --> 02:18:33.121]  All we've got is a blurb in the Times of India.
[02:18:33.121 --> 02:18:37.243]  You're confirming that indeed this did go on and you have the bona fides.
[02:18:45.626 --> 02:18:46.426]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:18:46.426 --> 02:18:47.647]  Please continue.
[02:18:47.647 --> 02:18:50.568]  We've been in touch with the Center for Constitutional Rights.
[02:18:50.568 --> 02:18:52.028]  It almost worked.
[02:18:52.028 --> 02:18:59.970]  Someone leaked the fact that this thing had been given to the prosecutors in Geneva, and what Bush did was cancel right away.
[02:18:59.970 --> 02:19:10.614]  Now, the White House or the Bush spokespeople are saying, well, he had heard that there would be demonstrations and he didn't want to, you know, he didn't want to burden the Swiss police.
[02:19:10.614 --> 02:19:11.574]  Well, Boulder Dash
[02:19:12.054 --> 02:19:17.298]  What he was afraid of was getting detained and actually brought to Hague for trial.
[02:19:17.298 --> 02:19:23.262]  Now, unless people think that this is far-fetched, this happened before.
[02:19:23.262 --> 02:19:35.151]  On October 26, 2007, again, the Center for Constitutional Rights, a really gutsy organization, filed a petition with the prosecutor in Paris.
[02:19:35.891 --> 02:19:39.074]  Donald Rumsfeld happened to be embarrassed at the time.
[02:19:39.074 --> 02:19:41.216]  These things need to be taken seriously.
[02:19:41.216 --> 02:19:50.625]  Witness the fact that Donald Rumsfeld went out the back door of the embassy, drove off to Orly Airport or De Gaulle Airport, and was on the first plane back to the United States.
[02:19:50.625 --> 02:19:53.108]  Cancel all his appearances.
[02:19:53.108 --> 02:19:58.312]  So, you know, the sad thing is that Obama doesn't have the guts to do the right thing.
[02:19:58.312 --> 02:19:59.554]  Well, Ray, stay there.
[02:19:59.554 --> 02:20:00.975]  Let's continue to look at this on the other side.
[02:20:03.203 --> 02:20:04.424]  This is not a drill.
[02:20:04.424 --> 02:20:06.946]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[02:20:06.946 --> 02:20:08.848]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[02:20:08.848 --> 02:20:16.053]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[02:20:16.053 --> 02:20:20.457]  Now, a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[02:20:20.457 --> 02:20:30.785]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them, how to create the perfect hiding place, as well as the places you should never hide your guns.
[02:20:30.965 --> 02:20:32.586]  Under any circumstance.
[02:20:32.586 --> 02:20:39.808]  These and other closely guarded gun caching secrets are guaranteed to keep your weapons safe and out of sight when the going gets tough.
[02:20:39.808 --> 02:20:40.488]  But listen up.
[02:20:40.488 --> 02:20:46.751]  For security reasons, the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time.
[02:20:46.751 --> 02:20:48.591]  Go to hideyourguns.com.
[02:20:48.591 --> 02:20:50.752]  That's hideyourguns.com.
[02:20:50.752 --> 02:20:51.252]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[02:20:51.252 --> 02:20:53.093]  Before they come for your guns.
[02:20:53.093 --> 02:20:53.753]  Hideyourguns.com.
[02:20:53.753 --> 02:20:54.313]  Right now.
[02:21:00.865 --> 02:21:02.026]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:21:02.026 --> 02:21:09.009]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:21:09.009 --> 02:21:11.571]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:21:11.571 --> 02:21:16.993]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:21:16.993 --> 02:21:19.935]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:21:19.935 --> 02:21:22.016]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:21:22.256 --> 02:21:28.540]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:21:28.540 --> 02:21:31.922]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:21:31.922 --> 02:21:37.746]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:21:37.746 --> 02:21:39.387]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:21:39.387 --> 02:21:40.708]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:21:40.708 --> 02:21:43.390]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:21:43.390 --> 02:21:44.811]  He explains everything you need to know.
[02:21:44.991 --> 02:21:48.613]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.
[02:21:48.613 --> 02:21:51.775]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.
[02:21:51.775 --> 02:21:57.178]  Midas Resources, a team of hand-picked financial specialists with decades of financial experience,

[02:23:00.578 --> 02:23:09.385]  The five main steps to great health are detoxification, an alkaline pH, elimination of infections, optimal hormone levels, and re-nutrification.
[02:23:09.385 --> 02:23:13.728]  When all these factors are brought into play, then your body is supported to create radiant health.
[02:23:13.728 --> 02:23:17.471]  Of all the nutrients needed by the body, protein plays a dominant role.
[02:23:17.471 --> 02:23:23.455]  The type, quality, and digestibility of that protein plays a key role in how good you feel on a day-to-day basis.
[02:23:23.455 --> 02:23:29.240]  Of all the proteins that nature offers, one is the most digestible and offers the most benefits for the most people.
[02:23:29.600 --> 02:23:33.481]  It is unheated whey protein powder from grass-fed cows.
[02:23:33.481 --> 02:23:38.422]  One World Whey is the first ever unheated whey protein powder from grass-fed cows.
[02:23:38.422 --> 02:23:41.683]  It is easily digested and comes in three delicious flavors.

[02:24:12.625 --> 02:24:21.974]  Ray McGovern, former top CIA analyst, will be with us in another 15 minutes, and I promise I'll get to all these mainstream media reports dealing with pole shift.
[02:24:21.974 --> 02:24:23.255]  People keep wanting me to talk about it.
[02:24:23.255 --> 02:24:25.197]  Paul Watson's written a big article.
[02:24:25.197 --> 02:24:28.000]  Pole shift threatens to cause weather chaos.
[02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.462]  That's what NASA people are saying.
[02:24:30.462 --> 02:24:34.106]  Fox News reporting they're having to recalibrate airport GPS.
[02:24:34.106 --> 02:24:36.909]  It's pretty strange, so I'm going to give you my take on it.
[02:24:37.709 --> 02:24:39.730]  uh... coming up after Ray leaves us.
[02:24:39.730 --> 02:24:48.674]  Ray, I think it's so important here for those that don't know the history or those that might have forgotten it to recap briefly all the different war crimes.
[02:24:48.674 --> 02:24:58.159]  I mean the knowingly lying about WMDs, the ordering of torture, the secret arrest, the rendition, the White House memos where the president is above the law.
[02:24:58.159 --> 02:25:02.001]  I mean Nixon tried that saying when it's the president breaking the law it's not illegal.
[02:25:02.001 --> 02:25:03.422]  That was proven to be a fraud.
[02:25:03.422 --> 02:25:03.822]  If they
[02:25:04.562 --> 02:25:11.689]  are able to operate and set the precedent of doing this, and we know Obama's continuing the rendition, then there is no Bill of Rights, there is no Constitution.
[02:25:11.689 --> 02:25:15.232]  But worse than that, we are tyrants because we're allowing it to happen.
[02:25:15.232 --> 02:25:27.183]  And absolutely, by pointing out that, that's probably why Bush has bottled that land in Uruguay or whatever, that they are criminals, that begins to put the idea in people's minds that they must be brought to justice.
[02:25:27.183 --> 02:25:30.326]  But briefly, recapping the crimes of these people.
[02:25:31.974 --> 02:25:34.196]  Well, um, you know how much time we have?
[02:25:34.196 --> 02:25:37.359]  We've got about five minutes, and then we'll come back.
[02:25:37.359 --> 02:25:43.124]  Yeah, I, uh, digest, of course, because you could go for 45 minutes just listing them.
[02:25:43.124 --> 02:25:51.811]  As Dennis Kucinich, to his great credit, did do, 35, 35 articles of impeachment.
[02:25:51.811 --> 02:25:52.592]  He read them.
[02:25:52.592 --> 02:25:56.055]  It took six or seven hours on the floor of the House, but he did that.
[02:25:56.055 --> 02:25:57.176]  They're on the record.
[02:25:57.176 --> 02:25:59.117]  You can get them from warsofcrime.org.
[02:26:00.262 --> 02:26:03.744]  You know, the ones you mentioned are the more obvious ones.
[02:26:03.744 --> 02:26:12.527]  Also, starting a war of aggression, which was banned after World War II in numerous international documents.
[02:26:12.527 --> 02:26:18.370]  But, you know, one of the things that, toward the end, I think it's Article 33 and 34, it talks about his, at best,
[02:26:23.152 --> 02:26:23.912]  We're good to go.
[02:26:38.377 --> 02:26:54.905]  Now, not many people know that George Tenet, the head of the CIA, lied under oath during the 9-11 Commission proceedings when one of the congressmen on the Commission asked him, uh, George, what did you say to the President during the month of August 2001?
[02:26:54.905 --> 02:26:58.706]  He said, oh, we had no contact with the President.
[02:26:58.706 --> 02:26:59.327]  I never saw him.
[02:26:59.327 --> 02:27:01.728]  I said, well, how about telephone?
[02:27:01.728 --> 02:27:02.908]  No, no, no.
[02:27:02.908 --> 02:27:06.550]  He was on, you know, he was on Crawford and I was on, well, it turns out,
[02:27:07.290 --> 02:27:16.921]  That Tenet saw the President on the 17th of August, and on the 24th of August, and on the 31st of August.
[02:27:16.921 --> 02:27:18.443]  So he lied under oath.
[02:27:18.443 --> 02:27:22.728]  His statesman, or his spokesman, a little while later said, oh yeah, yeah, he heard.
[02:27:22.728 --> 02:27:24.230]  But that's what was on TV.
[02:27:24.230 --> 02:27:25.371]  Why did he err?
[02:27:25.371 --> 02:27:27.814]  Because Tenet, however incompetent he was,
[02:27:28.234 --> 02:27:29.416]  We're good to go.
[02:27:46.636 --> 02:27:59.798]  The sycophant George Tenet lied under oath and, you know, there are lots of things that were in the Articles of Impeachment against President Nixon, three articles, which are also very operative under Bush.
[02:27:59.798 --> 02:28:04.419]  The difference is that John Conyers had some guts back in the 1970s.
[02:28:04.419 --> 02:28:13.301]  John Conyers is now an old part of the establishment and didn't want to risk Democratic gains by election of 2006.
[02:28:14.861 --> 02:28:20.928]  And of course, going back though to the Condoleezza Rice memo, where they said, we didn't hear a plan to fly planes into buildings.
[02:28:20.928 --> 02:28:27.656]  And then it turned out Bin Laden determined to attack, and that the FBI memos even said, fly planes into the World Trade Center.
[02:28:27.656 --> 02:28:28.777]  So they lied about that.
[02:28:28.777 --> 02:28:29.939]  They knew, and they stood down.
[02:28:30.595 --> 02:28:31.656]  Yeah, they didn't do anything.
[02:28:31.656 --> 02:28:36.899]  Now, the charitable explanation is that they were just completely incompetent.
[02:28:36.899 --> 02:28:46.926]  There's lots of reason to believe that there's a more sinister explanation, but none of them, to my investigative mind, are conclusive just yet.
[02:28:46.926 --> 02:28:57.452]  The other thing that needs to be mentioned, of course, is that there is a memorandum released by Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez, which shows that George Bush, on the 7th of February... Wow!
[02:28:58.833 --> 02:29:00.534]  It's the anniversary, isn't it?
[02:29:00.534 --> 02:29:04.617]  The 7th of February 2002 approved torture.
[02:29:04.617 --> 02:29:14.564]  What he said was, we don't have to obey the Geneva Conventions, we will treat prisoners, quote, what was the word he used, quote, humanely.
[02:29:16.940 --> 02:29:21.802]  And then we got the more detailed memos where they talked about what can we do.
[02:29:21.802 --> 02:29:24.063]  Well, we can bury people alive, yeah.
[02:29:24.063 --> 02:29:28.464]  We can torture children in front of their parents, yeah.
[02:29:28.464 --> 02:29:29.685]  Ray McGovern, stay there.
[02:29:29.685 --> 02:29:30.365]  I want to talk about
[02:29:41.761 --> 02:29:47.186]  Where this is going with an American president not able to travel to Europe, this is a big deal.
[02:29:47.186 --> 02:29:48.227]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[02:29:48.227 --> 02:29:51.310]  Then I'm getting into the other big news item.
[02:29:51.310 --> 02:29:55.233]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.233 --> 02:29:57.896]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.899 --> 02:30:05.462]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[02:30:05.462 --> 02:30:06.362]  Number one.
[02:30:06.362 --> 02:30:09.785]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:09.785 --> 02:30:10.645]  Number two.
[02:30:10.645 --> 02:30:15.548]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:30:15.548 --> 02:30:16.289]  It's true.
[02:30:16.289 --> 02:30:21.152]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:30:21.152 --> 02:30:21.992]  Number three.
[02:30:21.992 --> 02:30:25.575]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:30:25.575 --> 02:30:29.277]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:29.477 --> 02:30:30.278]  Number 4.
[02:30:30.278 --> 02:30:33.040]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:30:33.040 --> 02:30:36.724]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:30:36.724 --> 02:30:37.505]  Number 5.
[02:30:37.505 --> 02:30:41.648]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:30:41.648 --> 02:30:46.413]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:31:02.455 --> 02:31:05.818]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.

[02:31:53.167 --> 02:31:54.008]  Thank you!
[02:32:01.658 --> 02:32:05.660]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:32:05.660 --> 02:32:08.902]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:32:08.902 --> 02:32:13.705]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:32:13.705 --> 02:32:20.108]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:32:20.108 --> 02:32:22.330]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:32:22.870 --> 02:32:23.170]  Tim Geithner?
[02:32:23.170 --> 02:32:23.430]  Bernanke?
[02:32:23.430 --> 02:32:24.010]  They're arsonists!
[02:32:24.010 --> 02:32:24.811]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:32:24.811 --> 02:32:26.491]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:32:41.775 --> 02:32:43.916]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:32:43.916 --> 02:32:49.059]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:32:49.059 --> 02:32:58.144]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:33:12.699 --> 02:33:21.121]  Nomi Prins is a journalist and senior fellow at Demos, and we're going to be talking to the best-selling author here in just a moment.
[02:33:21.121 --> 02:33:24.862]  She's an insider, Goldman Sachs whistleblower, and we're honored to have her.
[02:33:24.862 --> 02:33:26.523]  But I said I'd play this clip.
[02:33:26.523 --> 02:33:29.983]  This is Barack Obama during the campaign.
[02:33:29.983 --> 02:33:35.645]  He said it many times, so did the Vice President Biden, that they wanted to bankrupt power plants in America.
[02:33:36.405 --> 02:33:43.232]  Meanwhile, they're not pressuring China, who builds a whole bunch of them, you know, every month, to have any controls on theirs.
[02:33:43.232 --> 02:33:45.854]  And now we're having rolling blackouts because of this.
[02:33:45.854 --> 02:33:51.079]  And we have the article, Obama's blocking of new power plants triggers nationwide blackouts.
[02:33:51.079 --> 02:33:53.442]  And the big issue here is insiders.
[02:33:54.938 --> 02:34:05.801]  At GE, now heading up as Economic Council, the former head of GE, they get waivers from all this, so it's another unfair trade advantage, just like insiders getting waivers from having to buy health insurance for their employees like McDonald's.
[02:34:05.801 --> 02:34:09.923]  I mean, this is mafia government, where you get the favors from the mafia government.
[02:34:09.923 --> 02:34:13.564]  That's why they want to have authoritarian control, nothing to do with environmentalism.
[02:34:14.204 --> 02:34:19.387]  So here is that clip of Obama saying he wants to bankrupt power plants.
[02:34:19.387 --> 02:34:22.569]  That is an act of war, of economic sabotage.
[02:34:22.569 --> 02:34:30.214]  But that's what Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and GE, these guys are all about, using government to shut down their competition so they can vertically integrate markets.
[02:34:30.214 --> 02:34:33.976]  Here's the clip.
[02:34:33.976 --> 02:34:38.539]  So if somebody wants to build a coal-powered plant, they can.
[02:34:38.539 --> 02:34:42.341]  It's just that it will bankrupt them because they're going to
[02:34:43.240 --> 02:34:44.623]  We're good to go.
[02:34:52.503 --> 02:34:53.864]  Now Obama was not drunk there.
[02:34:53.864 --> 02:34:58.548]  Our computer played it in slow time for some reason.
[02:34:58.548 --> 02:34:59.869]  It's only a 13 second clip.
[02:34:59.869 --> 02:35:03.892]  We're going to try to play that clip for folks one more time.
[02:35:03.892 --> 02:35:05.193]  But you can just search Obama.
[02:35:05.193 --> 02:35:06.434]  It says he'll bankrupt plants.
[02:35:06.434 --> 02:35:09.857]  You'll see many other clips of him online and different speeches.
[02:35:09.857 --> 02:35:10.857]  Here it is.
[02:35:10.857 --> 02:35:13.900]  So if somebody wants to build a coal-powered plant, they can.
[02:35:13.900 --> 02:35:21.726]  It's just that it will bankrupt them because they're going to be charged a huge sum for all that greenhouse gas that's being emitted.
[02:35:23.522 --> 02:35:24.383]  Okay, there you go.
[02:35:24.383 --> 02:35:25.944]  They're going to bankrupt him.
[02:35:25.944 --> 02:35:30.808]  Now, this dovetails with what Nomi Prins has been talking about.
[02:35:30.808 --> 02:35:38.154]  And of course, her latest book is It Takes a Pillage, behind the bonus bailouts and backroom deals from Washington to Wall Street.
[02:35:38.154 --> 02:35:41.636]  And of course, she's also the author of Other People's Money, The Corporate Mugging of America.
[02:35:41.636 --> 02:35:42.097]  She wrote that
[02:35:42.957 --> 02:35:50.264]  Six and a half years ago in October of 2004, a devastating expose into corporate corruption, political collusion, and Wall Street deception.
[02:35:50.264 --> 02:35:55.769]  That's why the big mega banks and the insiders want big government, because they can shut down their competition.
[02:35:55.769 --> 02:36:03.896]  Before becoming a journalist, Nomi worked in Wall Street as a managing director at Goldman Sachs and running the international analytics group at Bear Stearns in London.
[02:36:03.896 --> 02:36:07.439]  Her writing has appeared in the New York Times, Fortune, Newsday, Mother Jones, the Daily Beast,
[02:36:07.819 --> 02:36:14.206]  Newsweek, Slate.com, The Guardian UK, The Nation, American Prospect, Alternet, the list goes on and on.
[02:36:14.206 --> 02:36:21.534]  And NomiPrinz.com is her website, links to that up on Infowars.com.
[02:36:21.534 --> 02:36:23.076]  It is great to have you here with us, Nomi.
[02:36:23.596 --> 02:36:25.837]  Well, it's great to be on the show, Alex.
[02:36:25.837 --> 02:36:29.137]  I've been listening to you for a long time and it's really great to be on.
[02:36:29.137 --> 02:36:29.777]  Thank you.
[02:36:29.777 --> 02:36:31.058]  Well, we're honored to have you.
[02:36:31.058 --> 02:36:36.279]  You heard me just getting into the power plants being shut down that aren't insiders with the government.
[02:36:36.279 --> 02:36:43.600]  That pretty much integrates with what you've been talking about, about this rigged, planned, insider, crony, capitalist system.
[02:36:43.600 --> 02:36:51.042]  What's your take before we get into the larger issues on these power plants being shut down from Georgia to Texas and now blackouts everywhere?
[02:36:51.880 --> 02:36:53.221]  Well, I mean, that's the thing.
[02:36:53.221 --> 02:37:08.407]  What you're talking about, what he was talking about, is that if you don't have the money to effectively create your own loophole and work it out with the government, as one of the larger power companies like GE, then you're going to not be able to operate.
[02:37:08.407 --> 02:37:18.271]  And as a result, it consolidates the power, actually pun intended, into a handful of a few companies, which is pretty much how corporate America works.
[02:37:18.271 --> 02:37:21.712]  We are a nation in which the corporate
[02:37:21.772 --> 02:37:36.662]  Operations have continued to merge, have continued to consolidate power and therefore control and access to government and collusion with the government in order to, yes, get rid of competition and also control markets.
[02:37:36.662 --> 02:37:49.150]  And whether those markets are with power or those markets are with finances or those markets are with loans to homeowners, it's all really part of a system where companies really
[02:37:49.950 --> 02:37:56.891]  Not just control, but are gaining every day more control over all the things that touch our lives.
[02:37:56.891 --> 02:38:08.974]  Absolutely, and this is a rigged system, and that's what the globalists admit at Davos they want, is a global system they control where they control the rules for their advantage.
[02:38:08.974 --> 02:38:12.635]  And from my perspective, it's purely a mafia tactic.
[02:38:12.635 --> 02:38:13.835]  What would you call this system?
[02:38:14.515 --> 02:38:24.789]  Well, you know, you talk about the Mafia as extracting money from various small businesses in order to have garbage pick up, you know, in front of their businesses.
[02:38:24.789 --> 02:38:26.171]  And then the list, of course, goes on and on.
[02:38:26.171 --> 02:38:31.018]  But you're effectively extracting income in order to basically control a certain set of
[02:38:32.478 --> 02:38:32.818]  I think?
[02:38:51.186 --> 02:38:54.809]  Suggest laws that have loopholes in them for them to use.
[02:38:54.809 --> 02:38:56.570]  And they have the funds to do that.
[02:38:56.570 --> 02:39:00.393]  And, you know, we still have a system where the Supreme Court is fine with that.
[02:39:00.393 --> 02:39:07.358]  Recently confirmed the fact that they're fine with campaign contributions coming through corporations.
[02:39:07.358 --> 02:39:10.140]  Obviously lobbyists are going in and out of Washington.
[02:39:10.140 --> 02:39:16.224]  And in many instances, like with the head of GE now, they don't even have to... It's not even really an issue.
[02:39:16.224 --> 02:39:19.927]  They're just on the advisory board of the Obama administration and it's not...
[02:39:21.287 --> 02:39:26.248]  Just the Obama administration, of course, as any administration, but just the one that's currently operating.
[02:39:26.248 --> 02:39:42.612]  And that's really how the money not just gets consolidated on the profit of these companies, but gets used to infiltrate our laws, create their own loopholes, and facilitate their own future profits because of that.
[02:39:43.325 --> 02:39:47.466]  Nomi, I could talk to you as a former Goldman Sachs Managing Director for 10 hours.
[02:39:47.466 --> 02:39:53.668]  There's so many things to discuss, but on your radar screen right now, I saw you on Max Keiser a few days ago.
[02:39:53.668 --> 02:40:05.412]  It's actually going to air tomorrow, but he played an exclusive clip here of you basically saying, yeah, this is insider trading just with the, or borders on it, with the Facebook Goldman Sachs or JPMorgan deal.
[02:40:05.412 --> 02:40:09.954]  There's a lot of different deals that are going on right now.
[02:40:11.595 --> 02:40:14.757]  What is most important on your radar screen that you want to warn people about?
[02:40:14.757 --> 02:40:19.101]  You know, being somebody who's been an insider and really knows how things work.
[02:40:19.101 --> 02:40:34.855]  Well, I think, you know, you mentioned the Facebook deal and that's only important because it just demonstrates how Goldman Sachs, after having created itself into a bank holding company, basically the type of a bank that is supposed to administer
[02:40:36.605 --> 02:40:37.586]  I don't know.
[02:40:59.541 --> 02:41:03.162]  Our support, with our federal support, which it should not be doing.
[02:41:03.162 --> 02:41:14.565]  And that's just an example of how a company uses a government when it needs the government, in terms of funding it at the brink of a bankruptcy, which it stood at in the fall of 2008.
[02:41:14.565 --> 02:41:28.148]  And then says, you know, the heck with you guys, we're just going to go offshore, do what we want, raise money for our private deals, and if the FTC is going to ask us questions, we're just going to take them offshore and go somewhere where we don't have any questions, because those questions are
[02:41:28.228 --> 02:41:30.069]  That's really a big problem with the system.
[02:41:30.069 --> 02:41:32.131]  Right now, for example, in Egypt
[02:41:57.950 --> 02:42:14.787]  One of the things that I was looking at, and I'm by no means a Middle Eastern scholar, so I preface this with that, but a lot of the more recent economic problems that Egypt and other countries in the Middle East have had have been due to the fact that they have pursued
[02:42:14.887 --> 02:42:15.608]  We're good.
[02:42:37.189 --> 02:42:40.391]  It's not making a good return on it staying there.
[02:42:40.391 --> 02:42:43.773]  And that's what's happened to a large extent in Egypt in particular.
[02:42:43.773 --> 02:42:55.520]  Egypt was one of, according to the World Bank and the International Financial Corporation, which operates with the World Bank, one of the top ten what they call reformers.
[02:42:55.520 --> 02:42:59.343]  Reformers to them are not reforming their country's economics for their citizens.
[02:42:59.343 --> 02:43:05.907]  They mean reforming their borders to allow speculative capital to come in and go out as freely as possible.
[02:43:06.527 --> 02:43:12.272]  And it was in their top ten list for four out of the last five years.
[02:43:12.272 --> 02:43:25.341]  And the result, of course, when the worldwide depression started, is that the money that came in equally left as quickly, if not more so, leaving a lot of further economic devastation to the citizens of that country in its wake.
[02:43:25.341 --> 02:43:32.066]  And that's besides the corrupt dictatorship and the regime that has been there for 29 years, but this is really the more recent
[02:43:33.707 --> 02:43:33.907]  No, no, no.
[02:43:52.199 --> 02:43:57.023]  I mean, even Sticklitz, two, three years ago, Nobel Prize winner, admitted we were going into a depression.
[02:43:57.023 --> 02:44:01.246]  By every yardstick, unemployment's 20-plus percent here, 30 percent in California.
[02:44:01.246 --> 02:44:03.228]  The government lies and says it's 9.6, 9.7.
[02:44:03.228 --> 02:44:16.839]  You know, as somebody who's been inside of the, you know, the heart of Goldman Sachs, who's since then written and researched this, from your research, what's the real state of the world economy, and where are we headed?
[02:44:17.847 --> 02:44:29.378]  The real state of the world economy is that individuals are finding themselves less able to make a living if they had a living and falling into the poverty levels of their respective countries more and more quickly.
[02:44:29.378 --> 02:44:42.310]  And that's a direct result of trading and of bank capital and hedge funds and private equity funds finding spots and sort of pillaging them, to use the term of my book, but really pillaging
[02:44:43.050 --> 02:44:43.371]  I don't
[02:45:00.532 --> 02:45:02.914]  The financial industry is part of every other industry.
[02:45:02.914 --> 02:45:24.487]  I mean, I focus on banks having been inside of banks, but there's no company, there's no large conglomerate that doesn't work with the large financial institutions to find ways around paying taxes, creating long-sustaining jobs in the areas into which they infiltrate, because there's no need for them to do so.
[02:45:26.098 --> 02:45:37.282]  And so the state of the world is really captive to that type of international financial strategies that continue to get worse.
[02:45:37.282 --> 02:45:48.305]  And that's why you see in the Middle East, all of those countries have on record somewhere between 10 and 16 percent unemployment.
[02:45:48.305 --> 02:45:55.748]  But just like the United States, where we have on record, as you said, 9.4 percent right now unemployment, that does not in any way capture
[02:45:56.248 --> 02:45:56.809]  We're good to go.
[02:46:18.564 --> 02:46:31.659]  The squeezing of prices and any type of commodity and any type of financial service or any type of service throughout the world has the effect of squeezing people financially even further.
[02:46:31.659 --> 02:46:33.401]  And there's no barriers to that.
[02:46:34.121 --> 02:46:47.009]  The depression, the worldwide depression that started with, you know, what we call the crisis of 2008 was something that was really building up for many years for individuals not seeing jobs, seeing prices get too high.
[02:46:47.009 --> 02:46:47.649]  Well, that's right.
[02:46:47.649 --> 02:46:51.932]  You predicted it in your 2004 book and there's a method to this madness.
[02:46:51.932 --> 02:47:00.877]  These big central banks, who of course the shareholders are private central banks and families and shareholders, they are openly
[02:47:01.357 --> 02:47:02.017]  We're good.
[02:47:25.564 --> 02:47:35.693]  Once we get a country under our control, then we further bankrupt them, then there's riots, then that destroys confidence, then we can come in and buy up things even cheaper.
[02:47:35.693 --> 02:47:46.882]  And so they have a real stake in the pillaging, putting the populations under their control into a servile position so they can come back and pillage them and basically in a mercantile
[02:47:47.964 --> 02:47:50.707]  Neocolonial way conquer them.
[02:47:50.707 --> 02:47:52.389]  What's the mindset of a Goldman Sachs?
[02:47:52.389 --> 02:47:54.531]  What's the mindset of these pillagers?
[02:47:54.531 --> 02:47:56.073]  What's their in-game strategy?
[02:47:56.073 --> 02:48:04.603]  Because now they're saying they openly want world government, a new global cashless currency that all other currencies are denominated in, run by private central bankers.
[02:48:05.439 --> 02:48:15.461]  Well, the private central banks are the friends of the international private banks, because they allow for easy funding to trade.
[02:48:15.461 --> 02:48:20.702]  And the motive for everything Goldman Sachs does is purely profit.
[02:48:20.702 --> 02:48:23.903]  It's not, obviously, doing God's work.
[02:48:23.903 --> 02:48:25.763]  It's not trying to create jobs.
[02:48:25.763 --> 02:48:33.965]  It's not trying to stick around in regions and actually have a fair economic system, meaning fair for the population of those particular regions.
[02:48:33.965 --> 02:48:35.225]  It's in to get a good deal.
[02:48:35.265 --> 02:48:42.950]  Well, and it's in to get out, really, as soon as it can possibly do so, as soon as it's churned, whatever that good deal is.
[02:48:42.950 --> 02:48:58.659]  I mentioned in a recent piece, actually I think on my blog, about, for example, in early 2008, when things were really getting obviously bad with the subprime lending and toxic gas secretion on the back of that here in the United States, that there were
[02:48:59.840 --> 02:49:00.340]  U.K.
[02:49:00.340 --> 02:49:07.122]  arms, for example, of Goldman Sachs buying up pieces of luxury real estate developers in Egypt.
[02:49:07.122 --> 02:49:20.947]  You know, sort of trying to squeeze at that particular moment the last drops of what was the end of a real estate speculation boom, which will re-boom again, but which now is in its lower stages.
[02:49:20.947 --> 02:49:22.667]  And so that's the mentality.
[02:49:22.667 --> 02:49:25.668]  Mentality is, where can I go?
[02:49:25.668 --> 02:49:26.749]  Where can I trade?
[02:49:26.749 --> 02:49:28.009]  Where can I get investment?
[02:49:28.570 --> 02:49:30.193]  And they're doing this?
[02:49:30.193 --> 02:49:30.334]  Sure.
[02:49:38.598 --> 02:49:40.600]  Where do you see the derivatives bubble going?
[02:49:40.600 --> 02:49:51.548]  Because there's no way to get rid of that black hole, but they've sold us on this too big to fail, so now they've tied the treasure, the pensions of the entire world to their Ponzi scheme.
[02:49:51.548 --> 02:49:59.634]  Well, and not only that, the financial reform bill, and I loosely use the term reform, it's not a reform bill, but the thing that passed
[02:50:00.454 --> 02:50:09.542]  Um, in Congress and was signed by President Obama last summer to supposedly reform the banking system and does absolutely nothing remotely of the sort.
[02:50:09.542 --> 02:50:17.008]  It's just very, very many pages of a lot of legal banter back and forth, all of which can have holes poked in it really, really quickly.
[02:50:17.008 --> 02:50:21.832]  I mean, I can poke a hole in almost any line in that reform bill without even having a staff of lawyers.
[02:50:21.832 --> 02:50:26.095]  Um, but one of the things that it was supposed to do, for example, is
[02:50:27.336 --> 02:50:32.617]  ...create a clearinghouse or a place where derivatives would trade out in the open, would be transparent.
[02:50:32.617 --> 02:50:50.060]  But all the loopholes related to that said, well, yeah, we want them to be transparent and trade on clearinghouses, but we forgot to mention that 96% of the clearing activity of the place where these transactions are penned and inked, or basically transferred, are owned by the top five banks in the United States.
[02:50:50.060 --> 02:50:50.880]  They're owned by J.P.
[02:50:50.880 --> 02:50:51.180]  Morgan.
[02:50:51.180 --> 02:50:52.320]  They're owned by Goldman Sachs.
[02:50:52.320 --> 02:50:56.481]  Goldman Sachs owns one of the largest clearinghouses, or a portion of that, in the world.
[02:50:56.681 --> 02:51:01.465]  Tell me, stay there, we're going to come back and continue along that line and ask you the question, where's it all going?
[02:51:01.465 --> 02:51:05.568]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[02:51:05.568 --> 02:51:10.072]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[02:51:10.072 --> 02:51:16.217]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[02:51:16.217 --> 02:51:18.659]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[02:51:18.659 --> 02:51:24.604]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[02:51:24.744 --> 02:51:28.146]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[02:51:28.146 --> 02:51:30.027]  There is no other program of its kind.
[02:51:30.027 --> 02:51:32.208]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.

[02:52:00.840 --> 02:52:02.021]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:52:02.021 --> 02:52:09.005]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:52:09.005 --> 02:52:11.567]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:52:11.567 --> 02:52:16.970]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:52:16.970 --> 02:52:19.912]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:52:19.912 --> 02:52:22.254]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:52:22.254 --> 02:52:28.538]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:52:28.538 --> 02:52:28.958]  In fact,
[02:52:29.238 --> 02:52:31.919]  Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:52:31.919 --> 02:52:37.722]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:52:37.722 --> 02:52:39.382]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:52:39.382 --> 02:52:40.703]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:52:40.703 --> 02:52:43.384]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:52:43.384 --> 02:52:47.626]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.

[02:54:09.012 --> 02:54:13.235]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:54:13.235 --> 02:54:19.700]  Don't forget, right now we're fighting the complete takeover of our energy infrastructure by the insider globalist.
[02:54:19.700 --> 02:54:27.085]  The article at Infowars.com, Obama agenda to bankrupt power plants triggers blackouts.
[02:54:27.085 --> 02:54:28.766]  Get it out to everybody.
[02:54:28.766 --> 02:54:32.189]  Google search term, Obama triggers blackouts.
[02:54:32.189 --> 02:54:33.690]  We gotta fight back against this.
[02:54:34.847 --> 02:54:45.754]  We're talking to Nomi Prins of nomiprins.com, best-selling author, latest book, It Takes a Pillage, behind the bonuses, bailouts and backroom deals from Washington to Wall Street.
[02:54:45.754 --> 02:54:48.675]  Wall Street has been lobbying for domestic police states.
[02:54:48.675 --> 02:54:51.577]  They lobby to put dictators in worldwide.
[02:54:51.577 --> 02:54:54.279]  They basically, you know, want to secure their ill-gotten gains.
[02:54:54.279 --> 02:54:57.140]  They want to make us pay off their derivatives.
[02:54:57.140 --> 02:54:58.701]  I was talking to you during the break.
[02:54:58.701 --> 02:55:02.584]  I mean, you agree that we're basically, by every measurement, really are in a depression?
[02:55:03.542 --> 02:55:04.823]  Yeah, I think we are.
[02:55:04.823 --> 02:55:27.122]  And by the measurements that matter to individuals, by the measurements that entail getting jobs or keeping jobs that enable one to afford life, by being able to afford, whether it's health care or food or oil or whatever it might be, there's such a chasm between
[02:55:28.228 --> 02:55:33.054]  The haves and the have-nots, and that's not been something that hasn't existed in our world before.
[02:55:33.054 --> 02:55:42.266]  It's just that more recently, and particularly since the economic crisis started in 2008, in the fall of 2008, it's gotten worse.
[02:55:42.266 --> 02:55:45.910]  And the reason it's gotten worse is because there's this extra veneer of
[02:55:48.021 --> 02:55:48.801]  A recovery.
[02:55:48.801 --> 02:55:53.763]  There's an external veneer that says, well, the stock market's up.
[02:55:53.763 --> 02:55:57.864]  Well, the stock market across the world are up.
[02:55:57.864 --> 02:55:59.744]  GDPs are increasing.
[02:55:59.744 --> 02:56:04.766]  And GDPs, by the way, are generally measured, particularly for our country, a substantial measure.
[02:56:04.766 --> 02:56:06.446]  It has to do with financial services.
[02:56:06.446 --> 02:56:14.849]  So the creation of this sort of on-paper wealth drives how we consider our recovery and other countries consider their recovery to be.
[02:56:15.089 --> 02:56:17.713]  But only the mega-bankers are making the record bonuses.
[02:56:17.713 --> 02:56:22.880]  The only sector that's showing the big profits is the banksters because they're the parasite.
[02:56:22.880 --> 02:56:23.881]  They're the parasite.
[02:56:23.881 --> 02:56:25.143]  They're those services.
[02:56:25.143 --> 02:56:28.528]  They're the purveyor of why markets go up.
[02:56:30.410 --> 02:56:32.631]  Profits from corporations go up.
[02:56:32.631 --> 02:56:36.413]  It's all related to what happens with the banking sector.
[02:56:36.413 --> 02:56:41.615]  I mean, it's the kernel of all of this worldwide, because they all operate worldwide.
[02:56:41.615 --> 02:56:45.457]  But on the flip side are people's real economies.
[02:56:45.457 --> 02:56:47.978]  On the flip side is not being able to make ends meet.
[02:56:47.978 --> 02:56:52.900]  On the flip side is wages being worth less than what they were 35 years ago.
[02:56:52.900 --> 02:56:55.281]  So there hasn't been an increase for those people.
[02:56:55.541 --> 02:57:00.166]  You predicted a lot of what happened six years ago in your first book because you were an insider.
[02:57:00.166 --> 02:57:01.427]  Where do you see things going?
[02:57:01.427 --> 02:57:05.691]  Because it's clear they're not going to change course, even if the world's revolting against them.
[02:57:05.691 --> 02:57:06.592]  How do you see it ending?
[02:57:07.492 --> 02:57:10.553]  I honestly think it's going to get a whole lot worse before it gets better.
[02:57:10.553 --> 02:57:27.940]  When I left the industry and rolled other people's money in 2004, and credit derivatives were a tiny speck on the financial speculation screen, and CDOs were tiny, but they were murky, and they were leverageable, and they were dangerous.
[02:57:27.940 --> 02:57:32.061]  And things have gotten more complex and dangerous since then because
[02:57:33.895 --> 02:57:36.296]  There's been no opposition.
[02:57:36.296 --> 02:57:44.679]  There have been no regulatory barriers to stop the type of financial instruments and financial pillaging that's been going on.
[02:57:44.679 --> 02:57:45.879]  It's only gotten worse.
[02:57:45.879 --> 02:57:47.540]  But now there's a pretense that it's better.
[02:57:47.540 --> 02:57:49.160]  There's a pretense there's financial reform.
[02:57:49.160 --> 02:57:51.381]  Stock markets are back up, as we just mentioned, and so forth.
[02:57:51.581 --> 02:57:53.963]  So I don't think that gets better.
[02:57:53.963 --> 02:57:57.726]  I don't think that changes people's individual economies.
[02:57:57.726 --> 02:58:12.399]  I think it's going to get a lot worse, therefore, before it gets better, because after all of what we saw in 2008 globally, after banking systems throughout the world, particularly ours, we're looking at bankruptcy and we're looking at potential collapse.
[02:58:12.699 --> 02:58:14.761]  Well, I tend to agree with you, unfortunately.
[02:58:14.761 --> 02:58:16.502]  Naomi Prince, stay there.
[02:58:16.502 --> 02:58:18.624]  We're going to do five more minutes with the other side.
[02:58:44.707 --> 02:58:51.511]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:58:51.511 --> 02:58:55.093]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[02:58:55.093 --> 02:58:56.214]  It ended on June of 2009.
[02:58:56.214 --> 02:59:00.776]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[02:59:00.776 --> 02:59:06.720]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[02:59:06.720 --> 02:59:08.681]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[02:59:09.421 --> 02:59:09.942]  I think so.
[02:59:25.942 --> 02:59:31.224]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis and you can't eat paper, stocks or metals.
[02:59:31.224 --> 02:59:36.587]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious easy fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[02:59:36.587 --> 02:59:39.788]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
