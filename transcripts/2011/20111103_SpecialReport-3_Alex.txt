[00:00:02.383 --> 00:00:03.003]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:00:03.643 --> 00:00:13.306]  Recently, Homeland Security announced that they will extend their Stasi-style grope downs on innocent law-abiding American citizens who simply want to watch a football game.
[00:00:13.706 --> 00:00:22.069]  Now, we're here at DKR Stadium in the heart of Austin, Texas, to ask football fans how they feel about the new Homeland Security pat-downs.
[00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:29.166]  Having people pat down before they come in, I don't think that would, like the cost and benefit doesn't make sense.
[00:00:29.427 --> 00:00:37.771]  If they have to wait in this big crowd and big lines and then still get checked just to go in to see like their favorite players, it might create some personal problems.
[00:00:38.291 --> 00:00:40.933]  I feel like people are always going to find a way if they want to do bad things.
[00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:47.717]  If someone really wants to do something, most likely they're going to do it and they're going to find a way to sneak it through, but the more
[00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.992]  The more roadblocks you put up there, I guess the harder it's going to be, the more you might deter somebody from trying.
[00:00:53.312 --> 00:00:54.912]  Really, I think it's kind of going overboard.
[00:00:55.493 --> 00:00:56.433]  I'm not really for it.
[00:00:56.573 --> 00:00:59.674]  I don't think that it really will get anything accomplished.
[00:00:59.934 --> 00:01:09.638]  You know, you had the guy who tased the individual, and that situation was big, and I don't want to get tased, so in a way, it's, hey, that's security.
[00:01:10.038 --> 00:01:10.798]  It's what needs to happen.
[00:01:10.858 --> 00:01:13.239]  But in another way, it's really intrusive.
[00:01:13.723 --> 00:01:20.867]  Having Homeland Security at the entrance of the gates could potentially make it safer, but I also feel like it's a violation of privacy.
[00:01:21.027 --> 00:01:31.013]  Last Friday, Alex Jones called for a boycott of the NFL in his attempt to prevent America from continuing down its path to becoming a nightmare police state.
[00:01:31.153 --> 00:01:33.174]  Don't be part of this ritual of corruption.
[00:01:33.594 --> 00:01:38.137]  Boycott it, and even if you don't, go to NFL games, talk about boycotting it.
[00:01:38.277 --> 00:01:46.101]  This USA Today poll on September 16th clearly demonstrates that most Americans disagree with these aggressive procedures.
[00:01:46.622 --> 00:01:49.683]  But the federal government and Homeland Security don't care.
[00:01:50.244 --> 00:01:57.388]  Even though it's a clear violation of our constitutionally guaranteed Fourth Amendment rights, they're moving forward with their plans.
[00:01:57.768 --> 00:02:13.184]  You know a lot of privacy advocates are in an outrage as far as, and this goes with the TSA and airports as well, about children that are being subjected to the same pat-downs and where do you draw the line and what's your feelings about, you know, taking your kids to a football game and they have to be patted down as well?
[00:02:13.737 --> 00:02:28.216]  I can understand their reasoning for doing that, just because terrorist attacks can come through any ways and they would do anything just to get whatever accomplished, but I think that at football games, doing that to children is just a little bit over the line.
[00:02:28.597 --> 00:02:29.999]  I don't think children need to be pat down.
[00:02:30.845 --> 00:02:34.728]  It'd be an arbitrary age, around 13, I think would be acceptable.
[00:02:34.828 --> 00:02:38.910]  Underneath that age, I think, you should give children their space.
[00:02:39.091 --> 00:02:47.596]  Yeah, if you've got kids with you, especially, you know, you bring your son, your daughter, I don't know, it's a nice feeling that, okay, a little bit of a hassle, slowed the line down, but I feel safe.
[00:02:48.457 --> 00:02:52.039]  I would hope that, you know, reasonable minds would prevail.
[00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:56.902]  Maybe just say, you know, an 8-year-old kid is not going to be carrying a ball of some sort.
[00:02:57.503 --> 00:02:58.904]  I would hope it doesn't get that far.
[00:02:59.024 --> 00:03:00.165]  If I have something where
[00:03:01.285 --> 00:03:05.846]  I don't feel like I should be touched, or I had a situation where I've been touched before and I didn't appreciate that one.
[00:03:06.266 --> 00:03:11.748]  I'm clearly not going to appreciate somebody who feels like they deserve to have to do it for security reasons.
[00:03:11.788 --> 00:03:14.728]  Like, that's not a good reason to be that intrusive to my body.
[00:03:15.188 --> 00:03:24.130]  The unholy alliance between the NFL and the federal government is merely the next stop on the road to transforming America into one giant prison camp.
[00:03:24.571 --> 00:03:26.011]  A tremendous price to pay.
[00:03:26.411 --> 00:03:30.072]  And as you can see, most people don't feel it makes them any safer.
[00:03:30.693 --> 00:03:33.525]  I'm Darren McBreen for InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:03:34.008 --> 00:03:34.952]  Alex, back to you.
