[00:00:05.421 --> 00:00:10.263]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.263 --> 00:00:11.843]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.843 --> 00:00:13.384]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.384 --> 00:00:17.586]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.586 --> 00:00:21.647]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:31.191]  It is Friday, the 20th day of May, 2011.
[00:00:31.191 --> 00:00:36.834]  We're going to be live here again for at least the next three hours.
[00:00:36.834 --> 00:00:47.119]  If you'd like to comment on the ongoing budget battles, global austerity being forced by the bankers, the Dominique Strauss-Kahn situation, do you think it's a setup?
[00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:53.725]  Do you think he's getting a fair treatment by the New York police?
[00:00:53.725 --> 00:01:00.132]  What is your take on all of the big police state announcements coming out?
[00:01:00.132 --> 00:01:05.878]  I'm going to go over a bunch of this news and open the phones up for first-time callers in the first hour and a half.
[00:01:06.963 --> 00:01:09.784]  Then Dr. Jerome Corsi joins us.
[00:01:09.784 --> 00:01:17.829]  He says he's got the proof that Obama's latest long form birth certificate, remember the first was the only copy, nothing else existed.
[00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:22.371]  You were crazy if you said something else existed, but everybody knew there was a long form.
[00:01:22.371 --> 00:01:23.531]  Everybody's got a long form.
[00:01:23.531 --> 00:01:28.874]  Everybody knows there's a real original birth certificate, not what they originally gave us two and a half years ago.
[00:01:28.874 --> 00:01:33.597]  Corsi says he has the proof that it's a composite of multiple real birth certificates.
[00:01:34.597 --> 00:01:52.168]  All I know is that there's the kerning where computers basically squanch together typewriter print when it is a fake computerized font meant to look like it was done by a typewriter.
[00:01:52.168 --> 00:02:00.834]  And I know that I've blown up letters printed by the same typewriter on the form or what's meant to be a typewriter
[00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.432]  That's right.
[00:02:19.893 --> 00:02:22.834]  And we've blown these different to text up.
[00:02:22.834 --> 00:02:25.674]  Many other Photoshop and forgery experts have.
[00:02:25.674 --> 00:02:27.775]  It doesn't even take an expert to know this.
[00:02:27.775 --> 00:02:32.316]  Every pixel is identical in these letters.
[00:02:32.316 --> 00:02:34.956]  And so there's definitely something going on there.
[00:02:34.956 --> 00:02:39.797]  But it is an overall distraction from a lot of other big issues.
[00:02:39.797 --> 00:02:43.558]  That's why the White House is coming out with a Made in America coffee cup and t-shirt.
[00:02:44.258 --> 00:02:53.964]  And means to make it part of the campaign that he's made in America and you're discredited because he doesn't want to run on his record.
[00:02:53.964 --> 00:02:56.005]  And so we're going to be breaking some of that down today.
[00:02:56.005 --> 00:03:03.369]  I have not talked about this because, quite frankly, this happens routinely every few years.
[00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:07.892]  And I just haven't really paid attention to it.
[00:03:07.892 --> 00:03:11.074]  But I've done some research a little bit in the last week or so on it.
[00:03:12.842 --> 00:03:15.864]  And it's just standard operating procedure.
[00:03:15.864 --> 00:03:22.128]  And I really haven't heard anybody come out and address it from what I believe is the proper angle.
[00:03:22.128 --> 00:03:26.851]  So I'm going to address this coming up in the next segment.
[00:03:26.851 --> 00:03:33.535]  This whole doomsday Christian cult saying that the world is gonna end tomorrow.
[00:03:33.535 --> 00:03:36.617]  And of course it's already tomorrow in Japan and Australia.
[00:03:36.617 --> 00:03:40.500]  So they got 12 hours for the world to end.
[00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.901]  And of course it's not going to end.
[00:03:43.662 --> 00:03:45.944]  And it won't matter to these people.
[00:03:45.944 --> 00:03:51.449]  I will be the devil for not agreeing that the world ended on Monday when the world hasn't ended.
[00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:55.012]  And there'll be undoubtedly some lunatics that believe they've been raptured.
[00:03:55.012 --> 00:04:01.317]  Ladies and gentlemen, the rapture is not in the Bible until after Christ comes back and the dead in Christ are raised.
[00:04:01.317 --> 00:04:07.382]  I mean, I'm sorry, I've happened to have read Revelations, and no church taught this until about 150 years ago.
[00:04:09.168 --> 00:04:13.430]  And basically the Masons cooked this up as a way to discredit Christianity.
[00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.651]  That is an element of the Masons.
[00:04:15.651 --> 00:04:21.494]  And most of Christianity now in the world is basically globalist, Masonic run.
[00:04:21.494 --> 00:04:25.256]  And that's, if you like being fooled and you like being idiots, go ahead, knock yourselves out.
[00:04:25.256 --> 00:04:34.280]  I mean, I grew up hearing the world was gonna end in 87 in Dallas from the mainline evangelicals and billboards were up in town.
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.601]  And I heard it again in the 90s.
[00:04:35.601 --> 00:04:37.802]  And you people never stop your idiocy.
[00:04:38.937 --> 00:04:49.410]  And most of you are a bunch of torture-loving, war-loving people who go along with tyranny and then never go out and protest abortion because the world's ending next week.
[00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.333]  It's a big, sickening, shy-op cop-out.
[00:04:52.333 --> 00:04:54.696]  Why don't you get your head screwed on straight?
[00:04:54.696 --> 00:04:55.917]  Well, we're going to talk about it when we come back.
[00:04:55.917 --> 00:04:56.278]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.694 --> 00:05:05.237]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:05:05.237 --> 00:05:06.157]  Number 1.
[00:05:06.157 --> 00:05:09.580]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:10.440]  Number 2.
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.343]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:05:15.343 --> 00:05:16.084]  It's true.
[00:05:16.084 --> 00:05:20.947]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:05:20.947 --> 00:05:21.787]  Number 3.
[00:05:21.787 --> 00:05:25.370]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.072]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:05:29.252 --> 00:05:30.052]  Number 4.
[00:05:30.052 --> 00:05:32.813]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:05:32.813 --> 00:05:36.495]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:05:36.495 --> 00:05:37.295]  Number 5.
[00:05:37.295 --> 00:05:41.437]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:05:41.437 --> 00:05:46.499]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:05:46.499 --> 00:05:50.660]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.461]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[00:06:00.564 --> 00:06:01.725]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:06:01.725 --> 00:06:08.667]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:06:08.667 --> 00:06:11.208]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:06:11.208 --> 00:06:16.590]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.631]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:06:19.631 --> 00:06:21.692]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:06:21.952 --> 00:06:28.195]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:06:28.195 --> 00:06:31.576]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:06:31.576 --> 00:06:37.359]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:06:37.359 --> 00:06:39.000]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.300]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.981]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:06:42.981 --> 00:06:44.382]  He explains everything you need to know.
[00:06:44.662 --> 00:06:47.184]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:06:47.184 --> 00:06:51.808]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:06:51.808 --> 00:06:54.410]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:58.272]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:06:58.272 --> 00:07:00.314]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:07:00.314 --> 00:07:03.296]  It could never happen in America, but it's happening right now.
[00:07:03.296 --> 00:07:06.939]  Gas prices are exploding past the incomes of millions of families.
[00:07:06.939 --> 00:07:13.224]  As gas prices and crop failures push high food costs, you can still get the best food on the planet from eFoodsDirect.com.

[00:08:02.239 --> 00:08:08.882]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.882 --> 00:08:11.844]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:16.613 --> 00:08:19.835]  It is Friday, the 20th day of May, 2011.
[00:08:19.835 --> 00:08:23.697]  We're going to be live here again for the next three hours.
[00:08:23.697 --> 00:08:35.002]  I don't always agree with all of his political views, but I have found that Dr. Jerome Corsi is accurate in his investigative reporting and doesn't like to go out on a limb.
[00:08:35.002 --> 00:08:42.366]  And the many times I've interviewed him dealing with the whole birth certificate issue, he's never said he was 100% one way or the other.
[00:08:42.366 --> 00:08:45.208]  He now says he is and also has proof
[00:08:46.248 --> 00:08:57.531]  That they basically inserted this fake composite birth certificate into the stacks a month after Governor Abercrombie in Hawaii said he couldn't find it in the archives.
[00:08:57.531 --> 00:08:58.872]  Very interesting.
[00:08:58.872 --> 00:09:03.473]  And that he has proof that it's a composite and he'll be joining us today.
[00:09:03.473 --> 00:09:08.854]  He was on other radio shows the last two days saying that he would start releasing this information on Friday.
[00:09:08.854 --> 00:09:13.396]  So we'll see if he's ready to do that on this broadcast in one hour and 25 minutes from now.
[00:09:14.656 --> 00:09:23.518]  And then our once a week visit with Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster looking at geopolitical developments and the global and domestic economy system.
[00:09:24.568 --> 00:09:48.628]  I will open the phones up coming up at the bottom of the hour for first-time callers and when Chapman's on with us it'll be a free-for-all but people never get a chance to get in and the regulars which are great folks but they sit there waiting by their phone to dial in and generally plug something and it just it just isn't informative radio a lot of times so first-time callers that want to talk about the issues that we're going to raise or actual news items.
[00:09:49.369 --> 00:09:50.810]  We got a tractor for sale, folks.
[00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:52.692]  We're not going to be able to have you on air.
[00:09:52.692 --> 00:09:56.414]  We don't screen phone calls, but a lot of times that gets taken advantage of.
[00:09:56.414 --> 00:10:00.558]  Okay, I'm not giving the number out yet, but I do want to hear from everybody.
[00:10:00.558 --> 00:10:03.460]  A giant smattering of news, obviously, here.
[00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:10.405]  What's going on with Obama and his statement about the 1967 lines?
[00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:14.720]  I think?
[00:10:32.666 --> 00:10:48.441]  Uh, but basically Obama's trying to position himself with PR and fluff, just like he told the American people he was going to end the war, stop the torture, close Guantanamo Bay, hire no lobbyists, take no Wall Street money, and it's been 180 degree difference.
[00:10:48.441 --> 00:10:50.643]  It'll be the same thing on this front.
[00:10:50.643 --> 00:10:55.047]  So Israel getting all freaked out and running around, you know, pulling their hair out.
[00:10:55.047 --> 00:10:56.148]  That's all a bunch of theater.
[00:10:57.049 --> 00:10:59.792]  The Israeli lobby is one of the biggest funders of Obama.
[00:10:59.792 --> 00:11:03.595]  This is all complete 100% theater.
[00:11:03.595 --> 00:11:04.396]  Okay?
[00:11:04.396 --> 00:11:05.517]  End of story.
[00:11:05.517 --> 00:11:08.400]  The Palestinians are going to get any land you watch.
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:09.881]  The settlements will expand.
[00:11:09.881 --> 00:11:13.305]  Regardless of where you stand on this issue, that's the facts.
[00:11:13.305 --> 00:11:15.387]  We'll be going over that a little bit later.
[00:11:15.387 --> 00:11:18.029]  Also, five shot dead in Syrian protests.
[00:11:18.029 --> 00:11:19.671]  More of that unrest intensifying.
[00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:30.874]  China is now the biggest buyer of gold in the world, followed up by countries like Mexico, and of course major universities all over the world are buying gold.
[00:11:30.874 --> 00:11:33.295]  We're going to be going over that.
[00:11:33.295 --> 00:11:47.861]  Fox News is hyping that they're going to explain to us why Amaral Awlaki, at the time on the news, wanted for the crimes of 9-11, a known globalist intelligence asset who runs all the major Patsy attacks,
[00:11:49.081 --> 00:11:50.341]  Amir al-Awlaki.
[00:11:50.341 --> 00:11:54.702]  Now they have more details of radical imam's lunch at the Pentagon.
[00:11:54.702 --> 00:11:56.002]  Notice they say radical.
[00:11:56.002 --> 00:12:02.024]  They've been calling him number three or number two or number one terrorist now that bin Laden's dead.
[00:12:02.024 --> 00:12:06.745]  He was number three before bin Laden was reportedly dead.
[00:12:06.745 --> 00:12:11.145]  The ninth death of bin Laden, according to mainstream media.
[00:12:11.145 --> 00:12:13.046]  But now he's just a radical imam.
[00:12:13.826 --> 00:12:17.610]  Yeah, he was at these secret meetings at the Pentagon, but he was just a radical imam.
[00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:26.719]  And, wow, they've got a report coming out tonight that is going to debut the secrets of Al-Qaeda, the secrets of 9-11.
[00:12:26.719 --> 00:12:32.885]  And, of course, that's getting you ready for the million-plus documents in bin Laden's rat hole.
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:13:03.269]  Where of course they're going to have how they carried out the attacks and how it was done We've seen this before and it was done on September 11th nine and a half years ago Remember If you go back and pull the news articles up from the time or see my film Road to Tyranny made about six months after 9-11 You'll see the mainstream news articles in the newscast where they said not one but two magical passports undamaged
[00:13:04.779 --> 00:13:18.427]  These hijackers are on board aircraft going 550 miles an hour, they go into the plane, the planes go into the building, and on their person are the passports, and their bodies are basically turned into dust.
[00:13:18.427 --> 00:13:25.372]  They reported no body parts were found, bigger people, period, in the towers than about an inch long, finger bones and things like that.
[00:13:27.318 --> 00:13:35.644]  These passports were made of the same stuff as Thor's hammer, the center of a dying sun or a black hole.
[00:13:35.644 --> 00:13:38.726]  I mean, indestructible, unstoppable.
[00:13:38.726 --> 00:13:45.691]  They're now trying to study the passports to put armor on Abrams tanks that is impenetrable to even nuclear missiles.
[00:13:46.904 --> 00:13:52.227]  This is stuff that Superman's laser vision can't see through or beam through.
[00:13:52.227 --> 00:13:55.289]  This is stuff that they... Well, I mean, undoubtedly.
[00:13:55.289 --> 00:13:57.431]  It's Thor's hammer.
[00:13:57.431 --> 00:13:57.791]  Okay?
[00:13:57.791 --> 00:13:59.272]  I mean, seriously.
[00:13:59.272 --> 00:14:01.133]  This is believable.
[00:14:01.133 --> 00:14:08.277]  Not one, but two passports, undamaged, go... I mean, and the government reported this and said they had them on record.
[00:14:08.277 --> 00:14:09.238]  So it's true.
[00:14:09.238 --> 00:14:10.439]  Government doesn't lie.
[00:14:10.439 --> 00:14:12.280]  Questioning government is a conspiracy theory.
[00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:14.091]  Okay?
[00:14:14.091 --> 00:14:17.493]  Never question anything the government says to be a good American.
[00:14:17.493 --> 00:14:25.679]  The Founding Fathers said, trust government, do what it says, trust everything they say, give the government total power, and have no Bill of Rights.
[00:14:25.679 --> 00:14:26.400]  Okay?
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.842]  And so the government eradicating the Bill of Rights right now, that's good as well.
[00:14:29.842 --> 00:14:41.151]  But back to this magical adamantium substance that is impenetrable, nothing can stop it.
[00:14:41.151 --> 00:14:41.591]  Okay?
[00:14:41.591 --> 00:14:42.392]  These passports,
[00:14:43.697 --> 00:15:02.902]  from Saudi Arabia are made of a substance that can be on someone's body when it flies at 580 miles an hour into steel girders and the plane evaporates into flame and goes out the other side in a huge plume of fire and then magically, oh, it doesn't stop.
[00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:09.724]  These passports are so magical and so wonderful that like golems ring, they call to you.
[00:15:09.724 --> 00:15:12.785]  They call to who they want to find them, but not any normal mortal.
[00:15:13.615 --> 00:15:14.575]  No, no, no, no.
[00:15:14.575 --> 00:15:17.617]  The ring calls out only to FBI agents.
[00:15:17.617 --> 00:15:34.204]  So the magical Thor's Hammer material passports go out of the building, down to the ground, and then once they're on the ground in feet of dust and millions of papers everywhere, the FBI that day finds not one, but two of the shards of Thor's Hammer.
[00:15:34.204 --> 00:15:38.466]  And again, it calls out to them psychically, and they go to it and they have it.
[00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:41.242]  But it doesn't stop there.
[00:15:41.242 --> 00:15:48.291]  Magically, multiple hijackers' bags got stuck in the machines and had all the admissions of how they did it in them.
[00:15:48.291 --> 00:15:56.001]  And cars and vans with airline outfits and wire cutters and how they were going to do it.
[00:15:56.001 --> 00:15:56.842]  It was all there.
[00:15:57.978 --> 00:15:59.059]  I believe it.
[00:15:59.059 --> 00:16:11.972]  I believe this Fox News report coming out tonight, and I believe that they got all this data from inside Bin Laden's rat hole there in Pakistan.
[00:16:11.972 --> 00:16:21.101]  I'm sorry, his palace, where he had the shootout with the Navy SEALs, and then they dumped his body in the ocean, but he didn't have a shootout with the Navy SEALs and didn't use the wife as a shield.
[00:16:22.182 --> 00:16:27.628]  The helicopter blew up and the witnesses all over the neighborhood said that the men got on board and the plane blew up.
[00:16:27.628 --> 00:16:32.553]  The helicopter, those Navy SEALs won't be talking about how nobody was inside, will they?
[00:16:32.553 --> 00:16:38.779]  But again, Nixon didn't lie to us, Bill Clinton, George Bush.
[00:16:38.779 --> 00:16:42.103]  I will not put up with questioning government anymore, okay?
[00:16:44.707 --> 00:16:48.430]  All over the news and they have articles about how do we stop conspiracy theories.
[00:16:48.430 --> 00:17:08.943]  There's a big Wall Street Journal article that came out a few days ago where they described myself as a fire-breathing libertarian who is very dangerous and it goes on at the end of the article to say how do we stop these people and Bill Clinton has come out with a ministry of truth for government to shut down websites and information they don't agree with and they've also
[00:17:09.924 --> 00:17:19.912]  Paul Watson, an extremist at PrisonPlanet.com has written an article, government orders YouTube to censor protest videos and lawsuits are being filed dealing with this.
[00:17:19.912 --> 00:17:25.296]  And now you don't get your YouTube taken down because of content copyright violation.
[00:17:25.296 --> 00:17:30.080]  In fact, I'll show folks a document cam shot of this, this very reasonable government action.
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:35.405]  This content is not available in your country due to government removal request.
[00:17:35.405 --> 00:17:37.726]  So I think this is really great news.
[00:17:38.827 --> 00:17:44.769]  That Cass Sunstein's announcing they want to shut down people that question government because they're evil.
[00:17:44.769 --> 00:17:47.149]  And Bill Clinton's calling for it.
[00:17:47.149 --> 00:17:49.970]  And Media Matters is calling for it.
[00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:54.571]  And I think that's what America's all about.
[00:17:54.571 --> 00:17:55.171]  Okay?
[00:17:55.171 --> 00:17:55.912]  Good.
[00:17:55.912 --> 00:17:57.132]  Good.
[00:17:57.132 --> 00:18:04.874]  Because there are people out there that question that these passports were forged in the heart of a dying son like Thor's hammer.
[00:18:05.845 --> 00:18:07.206]  Indestructible!
[00:18:07.206 --> 00:18:12.048]  And they always return to the hand of the user.
[00:18:12.048 --> 00:18:14.130]  You understand this?
[00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:15.750]  Those passports are real!
[00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:21.333]  There wasn't a frame-up within hours to say Al-Qaeda did it so they could blame it on Iraq.
[00:18:21.333 --> 00:18:21.674]  No!
[00:18:21.674 --> 00:18:22.794]  There were WMDs!
[00:18:22.794 --> 00:18:24.695]  There were nuclear weapons!
[00:18:24.695 --> 00:18:26.576]  Saddam was working with Al-Qaeda!
[00:18:26.576 --> 00:18:31.399]  Those mobile trucks were anthrax-making machines!
[00:18:31.399 --> 00:18:34.040]  They attacked us!
[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:34.981]  It's all real!
[00:18:36.704 --> 00:18:41.246]  Bill Clinton didn't have sex with that woman, Monica Lewinsky.
[00:18:41.246 --> 00:18:44.207]  What type of sickos?
[00:18:44.207 --> 00:18:45.988]  I mean, I'm reading all these reasonable articles.
[00:18:45.988 --> 00:18:52.230]  They're suddenly all over the news about the dangers of conspiracy theorists, how they're destroying America, and I agree.
[00:18:52.230 --> 00:19:02.034]  The fact that some people in this country, and they admit it's a growing minority, soon to be a majority, very scary, question government and corporations and media.
[00:19:02.034 --> 00:19:04.355]  Government and corporations have never lied to us once.
[00:19:05.609 --> 00:19:12.651]  They're as pure and strong as those magic passports.
[00:19:12.651 --> 00:19:18.452]  And I just can't believe how evil these people are.
[00:19:18.452 --> 00:19:20.013]  It's really bad right now.
[00:19:20.013 --> 00:19:27.555]  It's really bad that so many people are questioning, I mean, in being conspiracy theorists.
[00:19:27.555 --> 00:19:28.695]  Let me explain something.
[00:19:28.695 --> 00:19:31.156]  It is un-American to question what you're told.
[00:19:32.898 --> 00:19:37.422]  Hot-bellied goons sticking their hands down your small child's pants, grabbing your wife's breasts, that's freedom.
[00:19:37.422 --> 00:19:41.285]  Putting you in microwave radiation machines, that's freedom.
[00:19:41.285 --> 00:19:47.850]  Foreign banks taking trillions to protect the money and not telling you where it went, that's obviously freedom.
[00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:53.815]  In fact, they've got an HBO special coming out where Paulson is seen as a knight in shining armor saving us with the bailout.
[00:19:53.815 --> 00:19:57.938]  I mean, absolutely, some sanity by HBO!
[00:19:57.938 --> 00:19:59.839]  Thank you, HBO!
[00:19:59.839 --> 00:20:00.360]  Come on!

[00:20:30.413 --> 00:20:39.739]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:20:39.739 --> 00:20:40.540]  This capitalism?
[00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:46.804]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:20:46.804 --> 00:20:47.685]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:20:47.685 --> 00:20:50.927]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[00:20:50.927 --> 00:20:51.727]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[00:20:51.727 --> 00:20:52.808]  It's time to understand the system.

[00:20:53.128 --> 00:20:53.468]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:21:00.894 --> 00:21:07.842]  Imagine being free of debt in just 12 weeks without payment plans or negotiating or hiring an attorney.
[00:21:07.842 --> 00:21:13.788]  18 years ago we cracked the code of debt collections and set tens of thousands of people free of their debts.
[00:21:13.788 --> 00:21:17.553]  It's called Zero Debt Guaranteed and it works for all debts.
[00:21:17.873 --> 00:21:19.674]  My wages were being garnished.
[00:21:19.674 --> 00:21:24.475]  So I used the program and the attorney dropped the case and he returned my money within two weeks.
[00:21:24.475 --> 00:21:28.317]  With Zero Debt guaranteed, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[00:21:28.317 --> 00:21:30.397]  There is no other program of its kind.
[00:21:30.397 --> 00:21:32.578]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[00:21:32.578 --> 00:21:35.099]  Call our help desk for lightning fast assistance.

[00:22:00.421 --> 00:22:02.222]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:22:02.222 --> 00:22:17.789]  The earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear disaster that killed thousands of Japanese citizens is nothing compared to the devastation that could be caused by hyperinflation that will soon hit the United States and could lead to millions of Americans becoming homeless, all caused by the devalued U.S.
[00:22:17.789 --> 00:22:18.129]  dollar.
[00:22:18.129 --> 00:22:23.552]  While the mainstream media continues to ignore inflation, our friends at the National Inflation Association provide
[00:22:23.792 --> 00:22:27.835]  A free weekly newsletter that educates Americans of the facts and truth about the U.S.
[00:22:27.835 --> 00:22:29.036]  economy and inflation.
[00:22:29.036 --> 00:22:39.124]  I urge you to sign up at the NIA's free newsletter at www.inflation.us to learn how you can not only survive, but prosper during the upcoming hyperinflation crisis.
[00:22:39.124 --> 00:22:45.209]  Silver has more than doubled since the NIA declared silver the best investment for the next decade on inflation.us.
[00:22:45.489 --> 00:22:55.000]  The NIA's team of expert economists are happy to answer any economic questions you have about inflation, debt, currencies, real estate, precious metals, and commodities.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.607]  Visit inflation.us to learn the economic truth that the mainstream media ignores.
[00:23:00.607 --> 00:23:03.390]  Will I have garlic breath after I take LEC?
[00:23:03.956 --> 00:23:17.150]  We get that question all the time about the world's best garlic extract, Alley C. And the answer is, Alley C contains stabilized allicin, nature's antimicrobial agent, and the active ingredient in crushed garlic, but will not give you garlic breath.
[00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:24.138]  Scientifically proven in double-blind studies, using low doses of allicin greatly reduces the number, severity, and duration of common colds.
[00:23:24.398 --> 00:23:28.542]  Our powerful Ali-C contains 300 milligrams of stabilized allicin.
[00:23:28.542 --> 00:23:32.646]  Just one tablet of Ali-C is equivalent to 40 garlic cloves.
[00:23:32.646 --> 00:23:39.533]  It's effective against asthma, MRSA, bacterial fungal, and viral infections, and helps lower high blood pressure and high cholesterol.
[00:23:39.533 --> 00:23:41.635]  Plus, it's a natural mosquito repellent.
[00:23:41.635 --> 00:23:44.558]  Boosts resistance to infection with nature's best garlic extract.
[00:23:44.878 --> 00:23:50.047]  Ali C. For more information and to order Ali C., call 877-888-7126 or go to GarlicHealthProducts.com.
[00:23:50.047 --> 00:23:52.130]  That's 877-888-7126 or GarlicHealthProducts.com.
[00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:52.951]  Fight back with Ali C.
[00:24:15.091 --> 00:24:22.218]  Okay, I was being sarcastic some of the last segment in the comments I was making.
[00:24:22.218 --> 00:24:30.446]  Obviously, it's impossible that one or even two passports, that's even more ridiculous, would survive and then be picked up.
[00:24:30.446 --> 00:24:32.968]  And they just planted evidence all over the place.
[00:24:32.968 --> 00:24:34.750]  More evidence of the inside job.
[00:24:35.728 --> 00:24:40.850]  And then you've got all the people they say Amarullah Laki runs being constantly protected.
[00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:43.151]  Major Hassan for two years.
[00:24:43.151 --> 00:24:51.414]  The underwear bomber, the Times Square, the shoe bomber that thought he would light plastic explosives and was described as being drugged.
[00:24:51.414 --> 00:24:53.495]  I've interviewed the witnesses about Muttalib.
[00:24:53.495 --> 00:24:56.316]  Looked completely out of his head.
[00:24:56.316 --> 00:25:02.579]  And a sharp-dressed man gets him on the plane and then he sets off the firecracker in his underwear.
[00:25:02.579 --> 00:25:05.240]  So we've got to have the TSA stick their hands in our underwear.
[00:25:06.237 --> 00:25:08.658]  This is ridiculous.
[00:25:08.658 --> 00:25:10.678]  This is a sick joke.
[00:25:10.678 --> 00:25:11.999]  And I'm tired of it.
[00:25:11.999 --> 00:25:23.363]  And now the government and the media are really trying to spin this Iloki at the Pentagon and Al-Qaeda being the main leadership of the rebels in Syria and in Libya.
[00:25:23.363 --> 00:25:33.026]  They're having real trouble spinning this and a lot of mainline conservative hosts that have attacked yours truly over the years are having to say, man, Alex Jones has got a point about this Al-Qaeda.
[00:25:33.706 --> 00:25:35.870]  They used Al-Qaeda against the Serbs.
[00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:37.474]  They used Al-Qaeda against the Russians.
[00:25:37.474 --> 00:25:40.199]  They used Al-Qaeda against Muammar Gaddafi.
[00:25:40.199 --> 00:25:45.389]  They're using Al-Qaeda connected groups in Egypt.
[00:25:46.445 --> 00:25:52.888]  And that doesn't mean that the people don't have a right to get rid of these dictatorships that have been Western backed in many cases.
[00:25:52.888 --> 00:25:57.150]  The point is that the globalists are trying to get the Middle East in uproar.
[00:25:57.150 --> 00:26:04.193]  That evidenced by Obama's statements about Israel should revert to the borders it had in 1967.
[00:26:04.193 --> 00:26:06.394]  Regardless of what side of that issue you stand on,
[00:26:07.975 --> 00:26:10.657]  I just look at it from a geopolitical perspective.
[00:26:10.657 --> 00:26:19.204]  I'm an atheist on the subject, a political atheist, not a religious atheist, and I just coldly look at it, and this is just meant to get turmoil going.
[00:26:19.204 --> 00:26:22.927]  We've got to ask why, and I'll talk about that later in the broadcast.
[00:26:24.892 --> 00:26:47.219]  That said, if you wanna talk about any of these issues I've raised or the mainstream media trying to basically discredit Christians right now by hyping up a few Christian organizations that are saying that the rapture will start sometime today or tomorrow.
[00:26:47.219 --> 00:26:53.361]  That's because we're already in tomorrow in Japan and Australia and areas of the Pacific.
[00:26:54.366 --> 00:27:03.952]  But if this hadn't happened by tomorrow afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, or tomorrow evening, then the media is gonna say, look, all Christians are discredited.
[00:27:03.952 --> 00:27:14.339]  And they say the rapture will happen by tomorrow, and then six months of earthquakes and total bedlam will then unfold.
[00:27:14.339 --> 00:27:15.780]  Now, here's the deal.
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:21.742]  And I'm going to try to be as direct as I can on this.
[00:27:21.742 --> 00:27:32.106]  Anyone who knows history, anyone who's read the Bible, knows that Matthew 24, 36 and many other verses in the Bible make it very clear
[00:27:33.471 --> 00:27:43.453]  And Christ told his disciples, anybody that tells you when my second coming is gonna happen is basically a deceiver.
[00:27:43.453 --> 00:27:45.794]  And here's Matthew 24, 36.
[00:27:45.794 --> 00:27:56.096]  But of that day and hour, this is King James, but of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but only my Father only.
[00:27:57.389 --> 00:28:03.192]  Again, Matthew 24-36, but of that day and hour knoweth no man, no man.
[00:28:03.192 --> 00:28:06.593]  Now I know a lot of you preachers don't agree with the Bible.
[00:28:06.593 --> 00:28:07.874]  I know you don't like me reading this.
[00:28:07.874 --> 00:28:09.135]  I understand.
[00:28:09.135 --> 00:28:12.996]  Know not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.
[00:28:12.996 --> 00:28:18.019]  And I can read it to you from 20-something other Bibles, other translations.
[00:28:19.403 --> 00:28:20.904]  The New International Version, 1984.
[00:28:20.904 --> 00:28:27.706]  No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the sun, but only the Father.
[00:28:27.706 --> 00:28:29.987]  New Living Translation, 2007.
[00:28:29.987 --> 00:28:37.090]  However, no one knows the day or hour when these things will happen, not even the angels in heaven or the sun himself, only the Father knows.
[00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:39.711]  English Standard Version, 2001.
[00:28:39.711 --> 00:28:45.753]  But concerning the day and the hour, no one knows, not even the angels of heaven or the sun, but the Father only.
[00:28:45.753 --> 00:28:46.733]  New American Standard, 1995.
[00:28:48.194 --> 00:28:54.681]  But of that day and hour, no one knoweth, not even the angels of heaven, nor the sun, but the Father alone.
[00:28:54.681 --> 00:28:56.022]  It goes on.
[00:28:56.022 --> 00:29:00.186]  He will come like a thief in the night.
[00:29:00.186 --> 00:29:03.029]  You want me to keep reading this?
[00:29:03.029 --> 00:29:06.312]  Here's the Weymouth New Testament.
[00:29:06.312 --> 00:29:11.637]  But as to that day and the exact time, no one knoweth, not even the angels of heaven, nor the sun,
[00:29:12.861 --> 00:29:14.302]  But the Father alone.
[00:29:14.302 --> 00:29:15.343]  World English Bible.
[00:29:15.343 --> 00:29:21.049]  But no one knows of that day and hour, not even the angels of heaven, but my Father only.
[00:29:21.049 --> 00:29:24.612]  Would you like me to continue with this?
[00:29:24.612 --> 00:29:25.954]  The New American Standard Bible?
[00:29:25.954 --> 00:29:29.417]  The International Standard Version?
[00:29:29.417 --> 00:29:31.159]  Would you like me to continue?
[00:29:31.159 --> 00:29:31.899]  And my point is,
[00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:46.564]  How do you have all these Christian broadcasters and all these other groups and organizations, some people who've made these claims a decade ago or more and been wrong, why do we listen to these people?
[00:29:46.564 --> 00:29:47.404]  Okay?
[00:29:47.404 --> 00:29:51.225]  They are there to discredit Christians.
[00:29:51.225 --> 00:29:55.166]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.166 --> 00:29:57.827]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.896 --> 00:30:05.057]  We're subject to other police action.
[00:30:05.057 --> 00:30:06.318]  Tyranny is here.
[00:30:06.318 --> 00:30:10.100]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:12.501]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:30:12.501 --> 00:30:18.364]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:30:18.364 --> 00:30:24.607]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:30:25.027 --> 00:30:30.972]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:30:30.972 --> 00:30:35.175]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:30:35.175 --> 00:30:39.479]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:30:39.479 --> 00:30:45.424]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:30:45.424 --> 00:30:48.987]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:30:48.987 --> 00:30:50.948]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:30:50.948 --> 00:30:51.409]  It's here.

[00:31:07.857 --> 00:31:13.000]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:19.663]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:31:21.718 --> 00:31:25.799]  They sew pride in every stitch.

[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:34.822]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:31:34.822 --> 00:31:37.863]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:42.011]  We turn jeans inside out.

[00:31:56.014 --> 00:31:58.375]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[00:31:58.375 --> 00:31:58.875]  Others don't.
[00:32:00.421 --> 00:32:04.964]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:32:04.964 --> 00:32:05.884]  Number 1.
[00:32:05.884 --> 00:32:09.307]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:32:09.307 --> 00:32:10.167]  Number 2.
[00:32:10.167 --> 00:32:15.050]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:32:15.050 --> 00:32:15.811]  It's true.
[00:32:15.811 --> 00:32:20.674]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:20.674 --> 00:32:21.494]  Number 3.
[00:32:21.494 --> 00:32:25.097]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:32:25.097 --> 00:32:28.779]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:32:28.979 --> 00:32:29.780]  Number 4.
[00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:32.544]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:32:32.544 --> 00:32:36.228]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:36.228 --> 00:32:37.009]  Number 5.
[00:32:37.009 --> 00:32:41.175]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:32:41.175 --> 00:32:45.941]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:33:09.295 --> 00:33:13.800]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:17.584]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:20.163 --> 00:33:37.474]  I should do an entire hour or two special on this and go in and pull up the history, go over all the names, but in the interest of time and other important news and your phone calls that I want to take on any of the issues I've raised or any issues you'd like to raise.
[00:33:37.474 --> 00:33:40.555]  Doing first-time callers right now on this Live Friday edition.
[00:33:41.636 --> 00:33:46.440]  In the interest of that, I'm just going to spend a few more minutes on this whole rapture cult situation.
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:48.702]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:48.702 --> 00:33:48.902]  800-259-9231.
[00:33:48.902 --> 00:33:51.225]  Now, I refuse to get into the quagmire, the swamp,
[00:34:01.966 --> 00:34:14.023]  The Bayou that is religious infighting and everybody claims they've got the answer and then it's just a bunch of Pharisees poking each other's eyes out.
[00:34:14.665 --> 00:34:19.967]  I know I got a big stick in my eye, and I'm not here trying to tell you what's in your eye.
[00:34:19.967 --> 00:34:30.690]  Unless you're a globalist openly trying to pass legislation and laws that attack my liberty and freedom, then you're fair game because you've stated what your goals are.
[00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:34.171]  But I have done deep study on the whole Rapture movement.
[00:34:35.202 --> 00:34:40.727]  And if you believe in the rapture, and that you're gonna get this pre-tribulation rapture, I don't think you're a bad person.
[00:34:40.727 --> 00:34:54.518]  I just think you need to be aware of the fact that this was never taught, not in the Greek Orthodox, or the Russian Orthodox, or the Catholic Church, or by Protestants, and after the Reformation, no one taught this.
[00:34:54.518 --> 00:34:56.580]  And I challenge you to show me where they did.
[00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:57.341]  No one taught it.
[00:34:57.941 --> 00:35:10.152]  You can pull up the verses in Revelation when Christ returns and clobbers the devil and the angel bounds up Beelzebub and all the rest of it, then the dead in Christ are raised, okay?
[00:35:10.152 --> 00:35:11.013]  Okay?
[00:35:11.013 --> 00:35:16.018]  And then that differs from the whole idea that you just immediately go flapping off to heaven.
[00:35:16.018 --> 00:35:22.584]  Now, in the last 150 years or so, different teachers in England and the U.S.
[00:35:22.584 --> 00:35:23.485]  began and
[00:35:25.438 --> 00:35:33.003]  Folks that wanted to attack Christianity pushed this, that Christians would be raptured before the Tribulation.
[00:35:33.003 --> 00:35:50.536]  And since then, the Christians in Russia, Christians in China, Christians in North Korea, Christians in Nazi Germany, even some people in World War I in this country, they always think everybody's the Antichrist and that they're gonna be raptured out of it.
[00:35:52.534 --> 00:35:55.585]  Well I go back to the old Bedouin saying, trust in God but tie up your camel.
[00:35:56.582 --> 00:35:59.463]  And it's this giant cop-out, okay?
[00:35:59.463 --> 00:36:25.034]  Let's say, before the world government, beast system, cashless society goes in, and even if you're an atheist, or an agnostic, I mean, you can't deny that the globalists have set up under the UN, 10 global regions, with 10 sub-regions per country, and they call them 10 kingdoms in the UN documents, we've covered this with Dr. Michael Kaufman, the official UN documents, and they're setting up a global standardized cash society, with face scanning and thumb printing to buy and sell.
[00:36:25.814 --> 00:36:29.496]  And that it gives the system total control over everything you do.
[00:36:29.496 --> 00:36:32.979]  And where they can starve you out if you don't submit to their system.
[00:36:32.979 --> 00:36:38.762]  And the no-buy list, the no-fly list, the no-travel list, the no-work list, this is the global standardized system.
[00:36:38.762 --> 00:36:42.505]  I have it in the news today as they start to roll it out incrementally.
[00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:56.734]  So regardless of whether you believe God, the devil, whatever, the New World Order psychopaths have taken this archetype, if you see it in that perspective, because regardless of how you slice it, this is happening, and they are manifesting it.
[00:36:56.734 --> 00:36:58.156]  They believe in it.
[00:36:58.156 --> 00:36:58.996]  They're setting it up.
[00:36:59.918 --> 00:37:18.187]  And they're earth worshippers, you get to the deepest levels of the UN, the Rockefellers, all these people, they fund the Luciferian Trust, they fund occultic groups, every major globalist, the Queen of England, Tony Blair, all of them, it's always coming out, are obsessed with this stuff.
[00:37:18.187 --> 00:37:21.309]  Bohemian Grove, Skull and Bones, they believe in the devil!
[00:37:21.809 --> 00:37:25.131]  They're not secretly meeting, and by the way, they believe the devil's God.
[00:37:25.131 --> 00:37:31.416]  They don't go, oh Beelzebub, oh devil we love you, oh man in a red, you know, pajamas.
[00:37:31.416 --> 00:37:35.119]  No, they believe Lucifer the beautiful, Lucifer the good.
[00:37:35.119 --> 00:37:39.382]  In fact, pull up the Masons saying, sweet Lucifer, I am Lucifer.
[00:37:39.382 --> 00:37:42.905]  I want to pull that up because most Masons are porch Masons and don't know this.
[00:37:42.905 --> 00:37:44.346]  It's how the globalists control good people.
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:53.589]  They don't understand that at the higher levels, they teach you, no, no, Lucifer's really the good guy, and Jesus is his bad brother.
[00:37:53.589 --> 00:37:55.050]  Now, lower-level Masons, they teach them,
[00:37:55.928 --> 00:38:02.694]  The point is, and then you can argue that in the last 200 years the Illuminati took over what Masonry was.
[00:38:02.694 --> 00:38:06.157]  If you get deeper into it, there's a bunch of different branches to it.
[00:38:06.157 --> 00:38:09.920]  So I'm not here indicting and saying Masons are bad and evil.
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:16.225]  I mean, mainline churchgoers are involved in more of a Luciferian initiation than even Masons are.
[00:38:16.225 --> 00:38:19.728]  The New World Order are masters of counterfeits.
[00:38:19.728 --> 00:38:21.710]  But again, I'm digressing.
[00:38:24.204 --> 00:38:36.654]  What we're dealing with here, in 87 they said this, in the mid 90s they said it, every time the media comes out and criticizes it, and it's even the same people that are doing it.
[00:38:36.654 --> 00:38:39.616]  Now I can't judge them, I don't know their heart, but
[00:38:41.311 --> 00:39:01.091]  They may mean well, but all over the news, every channel last night, every radio, TV, Fox, CNN, I was scrolling through channels this morning, in here in the studio we got multiple channels on, we got channels on in the coffee room, break room, making it look like all Christians are kook nuts.
[00:39:02.250 --> 00:39:07.033]  Just like by taking Muslim extremists and then saying all Muslims are, you know, want to murder everybody.
[00:39:07.033 --> 00:39:26.827]  They are taking this and then when the rapture doesn't happen tomorrow, Christians will again be seen like the Hale-Bopp comet cult thinking a spaceship was behind it and putting on their black Nike tennis shoes and taking barbiturates and drinking vodka and putting bags over their heads waiting for the aliens to beam them up.
[00:39:26.827 --> 00:39:27.908]  Beam me up aliens!
[00:39:29.144 --> 00:39:40.371]  This whole thing of being beamed up by Scotty up there with Captain Kirk, and you get beamed up to the teleporter room, and there's Jesus, and he comes and hugs you, and oh, guess what, my flock?
[00:39:40.371 --> 00:39:42.552]  You don't have to go through any tribulation.
[00:39:42.552 --> 00:39:44.854]  Every one of the prophets went through tribulation.
[00:39:44.854 --> 00:39:46.655]  Almost all of them got killed.
[00:39:46.655 --> 00:39:52.719]  Most of the disciples got boiled alive, crucified upside down, thrown into the arena.
[00:39:53.618 --> 00:39:54.839]  What happened to Jesus?
[00:39:54.839 --> 00:39:57.281]  Whipped till the flesh was falling off his skin.
[00:39:57.281 --> 00:39:58.742]  Crucified.
[00:39:58.742 --> 00:39:59.382]  Spit on.
[00:39:59.382 --> 00:40:02.485]  Crown of thorns crammed on his head.
[00:40:02.485 --> 00:40:06.187]  But you are not gonna have to do anything!
[00:40:06.187 --> 00:40:10.711]  And they've got these giant churches with helicopter pads and swimming pools and...
[00:40:11.758 --> 00:40:15.781]  Mainline Christians just go there to find people to cheat on their wives and husbands with.
[00:40:15.781 --> 00:40:17.482]  I mean, that's what, I grew up in Dallas, folks.
[00:40:17.482 --> 00:40:18.923]  Believe me, I've seen it.
[00:40:18.923 --> 00:40:24.006]  I mean, I lived in a middle class, upper middle class neighborhood, and up on the hill were the mansions in my neighborhood.
[00:40:24.006 --> 00:40:35.614]  You know, we lived down in the middle class area, and it was the preacher kids, you know, just devil worshiping, sex, partying, wildness, unlimited.
[00:40:35.614 --> 00:40:39.517]  It's the old joke of you want to find a loose woman, you know, go after the preacher's daughter.
[00:40:39.517 --> 00:40:41.358]  She's ready to go right now behind the church.
[00:40:42.439 --> 00:40:52.647]  Now, the issue here is you got a bunch of hypocrites, and they're telling you that you don't have to face evil, you don't have to get involved.
[00:40:52.647 --> 00:40:57.130]  I hear these mainline Christians, oh praise the Lord, things are getting bad!
[00:40:57.130 --> 00:41:00.313]  They're coming out with the microchip, the implantable chip.
[00:41:00.313 --> 00:41:10.501]  It's the end of the world, my goodness, Lordy B. I'm gonna be teleported out of here by a golden ejection seat, right into the arms of Jesus.
[00:41:12.691 --> 00:41:16.074]  That's not history, that's not biblical, that's not common sense.
[00:41:16.074 --> 00:41:20.278]  It says the beast will wage war on the saints and overcome them.
[00:41:20.278 --> 00:41:22.621]  And you guys will try to twist that any way you want.
[00:41:22.621 --> 00:41:25.524]  But Jesus comes like a thief in the night, and that's the return!
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:47.659]  And they've got all the big media in Hollywood financing this rapture business, and hundreds of millions of books sold, literally hundreds of millions, one title alone I was reading sold like 20 million copies of one author, movies, all of this, where people are told, and so Christians are never going to be able to recognize evil or fight it.
[00:41:48.416 --> 00:41:51.238]  Because, and this has infected everybody.
[00:41:51.238 --> 00:41:54.439]  It's a general attitude of, well, the world's just gonna end, it's all over.
[00:41:54.439 --> 00:41:56.421]  In fact, that's what the whole 2012 thing is.
[00:41:56.421 --> 00:41:59.923]  Now, I've been meaning to make a film about this, but I've been so busy on other fronts.
[00:41:59.923 --> 00:42:01.884]  I started it two years ago, never made it.
[00:42:01.884 --> 00:42:04.005]  I should just churn one out ahead of 2012.
[00:42:04.005 --> 00:42:06.566]  We're still talking a year and a half away.
[00:42:06.566 --> 00:42:12.289]  I should churn one out and point out that they want this cop out.
[00:42:12.289 --> 00:42:14.351]  They have the religious cop out.
[00:42:14.351 --> 00:42:16.272]  Oh, the Muslims think it's the end of the world, too.
[00:42:17.267 --> 00:42:20.049]  They're saying the end of the world's coming in the next few years.
[00:42:20.049 --> 00:42:23.832]  They've got the same manipulation going on.
[00:42:23.832 --> 00:42:26.554]  The Christians, many of them, think it's the end of the world.
[00:42:26.554 --> 00:42:38.144]  And then you've got, for the secular crowds, all the Hollywood movies and the hype being pushed about coming up in December of 2012, a year and a half from now, that the end of the world's coming.
[00:42:38.996 --> 00:42:44.781]  And I've been down to the Mayan pyramids, I've read the text, I've looked into it, it doesn't even say that.
[00:42:44.781 --> 00:43:02.976]  Even if you believe a bunch of human-sacrificing, wild-eyed, hallucinogen-taking lunatics, the Aztec priest class, following the Mayan system, it means a new hearth will be lit, that a new age is beginning.
[00:43:02.976 --> 00:43:04.237]  It does not mean the end of the world.
[00:43:06.451 --> 00:43:08.353]  It does not mean the end of the world.
[00:43:08.353 --> 00:43:17.521]  Basically, our world is the big God's hallucination, and he basically wakes up and then goes back to sleep on 2012, is one Mayan angle.
[00:43:17.521 --> 00:43:21.485]  The other is a new hearth will be lit, and a new system will start.
[00:43:21.485 --> 00:43:31.975]  I mean, look, look, I've actually gone to the pyramids, gone and actually not gotten the general tour, but gone and talked to resident Mayan and Western archaeologists, and I've read the books.
[00:43:32.615 --> 00:43:34.678]  The whole Mayan thing isn't even real.
[00:43:34.678 --> 00:43:40.524]  Even if you believe that the Mayan prophecies were real, that's not the Mayan prophecies.
[00:43:40.524 --> 00:43:46.150]  So, for the New Age crowd, which is really the old age, they think it's the end of the world.
[00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:48.232]  The Christians have been taught it's the end of the world.
[00:43:48.232 --> 00:43:50.394]  Catholics, a bunch of them, think it's the end of the world.
[00:43:50.394 --> 00:43:53.157]  With all this Fatima stuff I get constantly emailed about.
[00:43:53.157 --> 00:43:53.437]  Okay?
[00:43:54.471 --> 00:43:57.592]  The end of the world would be a giant asteroid hitting.
[00:43:57.592 --> 00:44:00.934]  Would be a super plague being released by these bioweapons makers.
[00:44:00.934 --> 00:44:10.078]  And then you'll all go die thinking it's the end of the world and God doing it, when it's the globalists who've got their emergency seed banks at the Arctic Circle and 14 others.
[00:44:10.078 --> 00:44:10.779]  They've got their...
[00:44:12.145 --> 00:44:26.151]  They're government bunkers, they're COG systems, they're gearing up and they've got all these History Channel, Discovery Channel shows about Earth without man and they're pushing it on Comedy Central how great it's gonna be when almost everybody gets killed soon.
[00:44:26.151 --> 00:44:41.597]  They're creating a subconscious psychological expectation that most of us aren't gonna be here soon because the New World Order is getting ready to kill most of us and has written countless white papers that we source on how they're going to do it.
[00:44:43.137 --> 00:44:46.659]  What is TheEndgame.com if you want to just see the tip of the iceberg?
[00:44:46.659 --> 00:44:57.026]  So, there is a mass, full-court press against every religious group and secular groups with 2012 mumbo-jumbo that it's a foregone conclusion that you're going to die.
[00:44:57.026 --> 00:45:03.411]  Because if they can sell you on there's no hope, then you'll just sit there and lay down to them rolling out their global government system.
[00:45:04.071 --> 00:45:10.975]  Which itself is a technotronic police state to lock everyone down to then carry out the orderly extermination.
[00:45:10.975 --> 00:45:11.856]  Okay?
[00:45:11.856 --> 00:45:13.236]  As for me, I'm not buying it.
[00:45:13.236 --> 00:45:14.737]  I'm not standing down.
[00:45:14.737 --> 00:45:15.358]  But look at this.
[00:45:15.358 --> 00:45:18.740]  New York man spends life savings ahead of 2012 Doomsday.
[00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:25.964]  New York man spent $140,000 of his life savings advertising his prediction that the world will end tomorrow.
[00:45:25.964 --> 00:45:30.327]  And it's already today, again, in the Pacific, on the other side of the planet.
[00:45:32.049 --> 00:45:36.172]  Continuing here, where did all this come from?
[00:45:36.172 --> 00:45:41.116]  This is WDBJ7 News TV.
[00:45:41.116 --> 00:45:44.819]  Predictor of May 21st, Doomsday, to watch it on TV.
[00:45:44.819 --> 00:45:45.380]  The U.S.
[00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:50.123]  Evangelical Christian broadcaster predicted that Judgment Day will come on Saturday.
[00:45:50.123 --> 00:45:54.347]  Says he expects to stay close to the TV or radio to monitor the unfolding apocalypse.
[00:45:54.347 --> 00:45:59.271]  Harold Camping, 89, previously made a failed prediction that Jesus Christ would return to Earth in 1994.
[00:45:59.271 --> 00:45:59.611]  I remember that.
[00:46:01.112 --> 00:46:03.793]  The head of the Christian Radio Network Family Stations.
[00:46:03.793 --> 00:46:06.074]  And he'll end up getting a bunch of money.
[00:46:06.074 --> 00:46:10.396]  Hyping, give us the money in the last year so they can put out ads saying the end of the world.
[00:46:10.396 --> 00:46:14.217]  Then it'll be, oh, God gave us a reprieve.
[00:46:14.217 --> 00:46:15.218]  Just watch tomorrow.
[00:46:15.218 --> 00:46:17.699]  I'll be the bad guy for saying this was baloney.
[00:46:18.459 --> 00:46:20.141]  And Hokom, not him.
[00:46:20.141 --> 00:46:21.522]  I'll be bad for being right.
[00:46:21.522 --> 00:46:22.323]  Watch.
[00:46:22.323 --> 00:46:25.466]  The head of the Christian radio network Family Stations Inc.
[00:46:25.466 --> 00:46:28.869]  says he is sure the earthquake will shake the earth on May 21st.
[00:46:28.869 --> 00:46:30.370]  Well, there's earthquakes all the time.
[00:46:30.370 --> 00:46:37.557]  Sweeping true believers to heaven and leaving others behind to be engulfed in world destruction over a few months.
[00:46:37.557 --> 00:46:41.881]  We know, without a shadow of a doubt, it's going to happen, Camping told Reuters.
[00:46:43.171 --> 00:46:46.954]  His family radio has 66 US stations and broadcasts from more than 30 languages.
[00:46:46.954 --> 00:46:48.455]  They're international affiliates.
[00:46:48.455 --> 00:46:51.037]  And a lot of these folks are good people.
[00:46:51.037 --> 00:46:54.460]  But, and I'm sure this guy means well, but he's been wrong again.
[00:46:54.460 --> 00:47:00.645]  Pastor, pastor, please, have you read the Bible you claim to follow?
[00:47:00.645 --> 00:47:05.048]  Christ said, look out for people that run around saying this stuff.
[00:47:05.048 --> 00:47:08.231]  No one knows the time of the second coming.
[00:47:08.231 --> 00:47:12.134]  And there isn't a pre-rapture, before that, Bubba, I've read the Bible.
[00:47:13.029 --> 00:47:16.290]  But it doesn't matter, you're the one that's always wrong, so you're right.
[00:47:16.290 --> 00:47:23.892]  Continuing, I can't tell you how many times there's groups out there saying the end of the world is coming, or space aliens are gonna land, this is all a psyop.
[00:47:23.892 --> 00:47:33.614]  Matthew 24, 36, but of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, not the sun, but my Father only.
[00:47:41.001 --> 00:47:42.742]  But, you know, that's Jesus.
[00:47:42.742 --> 00:47:44.382]  Who wants to listen to Him?
[00:47:44.382 --> 00:47:50.625]  We can listen... We can listen to Harold Camping!
[00:47:50.625 --> 00:47:51.785]  Harold Camping!
[00:47:51.785 --> 00:47:52.965]  Who needs Jesus?
[00:47:52.965 --> 00:47:55.987]  We have... Who needs Yeshua?
[00:47:55.987 --> 00:47:57.927]  We have Harold Camping!
[00:47:57.927 --> 00:48:02.429]  He will tell us everything we need to know.
[00:48:02.429 --> 00:48:10.052]  And this will further, then, just discredit Christians who believe you reap what you sow, do unto others as you have done unto you,
[00:48:11.852 --> 00:48:15.415]  You know, don't support a world numbering system to buy and sell.
[00:48:15.415 --> 00:48:19.878]  Whether you believe Jesus is a real entity or not, that's some good stuff to follow.
[00:48:19.878 --> 00:48:21.659]  But no, no, no.
[00:48:21.659 --> 00:48:32.147]  Harold Camping will speak for Christ, and he will speak the opposite of what Christ said on this subject, and then will be discredited.
[00:48:32.147 --> 00:48:33.729]  So, there you have it, my friends.
[00:48:34.778 --> 00:48:36.220]  Here's MSNBC.
[00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:40.725]  Kids hope to attend party, but parents say world is going to end.
[00:48:40.725 --> 00:48:41.887]  Yes!
[00:48:41.887 --> 00:48:46.392]  And all these children will lose their faith, or may lose their faith after this.
[00:48:46.392 --> 00:48:49.496]  Families divided as some people believe world will self-destruct tomorrow.
[00:48:50.356 --> 00:48:54.679]  Today in areas of Asia and Australia.
[00:48:54.679 --> 00:48:56.841]  Continuing, the end of the world as we know it.
[00:48:56.841 --> 00:49:02.004]  Prediction of Saturday rapture is fuel for faithful and doubters.
[00:49:02.004 --> 00:49:05.527]  Doomsday church still open for business, CNN.
[00:49:05.527 --> 00:49:10.791]  May 21st, Doomsday leader blames the gays.
[00:49:10.791 --> 00:49:12.071]  The world is going to end.
[00:49:12.071 --> 00:49:13.092]  Okay.
[00:49:17.119 --> 00:49:18.922]  So there you have it, my friends.
[00:49:18.922 --> 00:49:20.906]  The world is gonna end tomorrow.
[00:49:20.906 --> 00:49:24.352]  That is, the Christians are going to be teleported out of here, or...
[00:49:25.925 --> 00:49:33.591]  Christians argue about it, they believe in this rapture stuff, this pre-trib rap, that they fall over dead.
[00:49:33.591 --> 00:49:41.797]  And undoubtedly, there'll probably be some people that at midnight, when they don't get teleported, they're gonna drink Kool-Aid or something and then die and go, I'm going, I'm beaming, ooh!
[00:49:41.797 --> 00:49:44.740]  They fall over dead like the Jim Jones facility.
[00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:47.202]  I'm coming, hail bop, here I come!
[00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:52.066]  I'm sorry, I just can't handle it anymore.
[00:49:52.066 --> 00:49:55.976]  Those hell-bought people who were castrated themselves.
[00:49:57.441 --> 00:50:06.885]  Computer programmers running around in California and then took barbiturates, it's so sad, and killed themselves because they were being teleported up.
[00:50:06.885 --> 00:50:15.609]  Are you noticing you're getting this from the New Agers, the New Age mainline Christians, big groups of Catholics, and then the whole 2012 people?
[00:50:15.609 --> 00:50:17.190]  All right, I'm done, I'm done.
[00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:19.231]  I said I'd go to your phone calls, told free number to join us.
[00:50:21.012 --> 00:50:21.613]  1-800-259-9231.

[00:50:33.970 --> 00:50:36.734]  Dr. Jerome Corsi joining us today.
[00:50:38.038 --> 00:50:42.101]  China gives Pakistan 50 fighter jets, New York Times reports.
[00:50:42.101 --> 00:50:50.869]  That relationship's getting cozier, thanks to the escalating globalist war inside Pakistan, which destabilized that entire area.
[00:50:50.869 --> 00:51:00.197]  You know, World War III's really already started, with all these staged revolutions and all these new wars being kicked off, but they're not calling it a war, they're calling it liberty and peace and...
[00:51:00.837 --> 00:51:04.080]  Do you want to learn more about preparing for the hard times ahead?

[00:53:02.972 --> 00:53:05.314]  Alex Jones here with key information.
[00:53:05.314 --> 00:53:05.874]  The U.S.
[00:53:05.874 --> 00:53:13.160]  government is a Ponzi scheme that relies on the Treasury continuously selling large amounts of government bonds to foreign central banks.
[00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:15.882]  With Japan about to become a seller of U.S.
[00:53:15.882 --> 00:53:19.204]  bonds in order to rebuild its own nation, and the U.S.
[00:53:19.204 --> 00:53:25.849]  antagonizing China by calling them currency manipulators, the Federal Reserve, which is already buying about 70% of U.S.
[00:53:25.849 --> 00:53:28.511]  Treasuries, will soon be the only buyer left of U.S.
[00:53:28.511 --> 00:53:28.952]  Treasuries.
[00:53:29.352 --> 00:53:32.875]  Our friends at the National Inflation Association believe that the U.S.
[00:53:32.875 --> 00:53:38.819]  dollar will soon become worthless and Americans will see the purchasing power of their incomes and savings destroyed.
[00:53:38.819 --> 00:53:47.286]  I strongly urge my fellow Americans to sign up for the free NIA newsletter at www.inflation.us.
[00:53:47.286 --> 00:53:56.633]  If you are sick and tired of the economic propaganda in the mainstream media, sign up for free at inflation.us to learn the economic truth that the mainstream media ignores.
[00:54:09.571 --> 00:54:15.096]  Okay, Tyler, Jeff, Dave, JP, others, we're going to you.
[00:54:15.096 --> 00:54:18.459]  A toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[00:54:18.459 --> 00:54:20.181]  Coming up, this is big news.
[00:54:20.181 --> 00:54:30.290]  Government orders YouTube to censor protest videos, and the YouTube message is, this content is not available in your country due to a government removal request.
[00:54:30.290 --> 00:54:33.312]  This is out of England, but we've also seen it starting to happen in the US.
[00:54:34.173 --> 00:54:36.414]  And people say, well then just don't go on YouTube.
[00:54:36.414 --> 00:54:39.656]  YouTube's over half the video viewing in the world.
[00:54:39.656 --> 00:54:40.476]  And growing.
[00:54:40.476 --> 00:54:42.017]  It's the third biggest website in the world.
[00:54:42.017 --> 00:54:46.299]  It advertises as a community commons as long as you follow the rules.
[00:54:46.299 --> 00:54:48.400]  It's the modern town square.
[00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:50.201]  It's where the fight is.
[00:54:50.201 --> 00:54:52.802]  And it's government ordering it taken down.
[00:54:52.802 --> 00:54:55.724]  Not even the private policy of YouTube.
[00:54:57.273 --> 00:54:58.534]  And so we're gonna be getting into that.
[00:54:58.534 --> 00:55:01.135]  Also, they want you to now do the Trusted Traveler.
[00:55:01.135 --> 00:55:02.375]  I told you they'd do this years ago.
[00:55:02.375 --> 00:55:18.142]  They stick their hands down your pants, make you scared, then you agree to get government authorization and opt in for them to run you through all these background checks they're already doing to then say now you're allowed to travel without the hands down the pants, but then they'll phase the hands down the pants back in later.
[00:55:18.142 --> 00:55:19.342]  Okay, so this was always planned.
[00:55:19.342 --> 00:55:21.383]  It's psychological warfare.
[00:55:21.383 --> 00:55:23.244]  That is coming up as well.
[00:55:23.244 --> 00:55:25.385]  Huge developments taking place.
[00:55:27.287 --> 00:55:28.850]  Okay, let's go to your phone calls.
[00:55:28.850 --> 00:55:30.333]  Tyler in Texas, you're on the air.
[00:55:36.365 --> 00:55:39.866]  But also what's counterfeit is our nation's money supply.
[00:55:39.866 --> 00:55:44.967]  If Bill Still was correct, the national debt is the amount of money that we borrowed.
[00:55:44.967 --> 00:55:49.849]  So the only way to pay it off would be to give every single dollar bill back, and then we'd owe the interest.
[00:55:49.849 --> 00:56:03.873]  The solution to all our problems in this new world order would be to eliminate this phony money system and to get back to a governmental currency of some kind, because the people's labor is what's valuable, and these private bankers, they live like kings!
[00:56:04.113 --> 00:56:04.473]  That's right.
[00:56:24.186 --> 00:56:24.847]  I think?
[00:56:42.236 --> 00:56:46.142]  Right, the United States is a corporation that did file bankruptcy in 1913.
[00:56:46.142 --> 00:56:50.989]  There's a great guest I'd like to recommend, his name is Winston Shrout.
[00:56:50.989 --> 00:56:57.940]  He talks about the bankruptcy and how they use legalese and commercial banking laws against the people to basically make them slaves.
[00:56:58.629 --> 00:57:05.553]  Well, from my research, the real official bankruptcy was the 1933 action of Roosevelt, but I appreciate your call.
[00:57:05.553 --> 00:57:07.915]  But yes, the nation has been taken over a long time ago.
[00:57:07.915 --> 00:57:09.896]  The New World Order isn't coming.
[00:57:09.896 --> 00:57:14.599]  It's here, and America is the heart that pumps the blood for the New World Order.
[00:57:14.599 --> 00:57:20.122]  The European Union, British system, on top of it is the brain, and it's illegitimate.
[00:57:20.122 --> 00:57:20.862]  We've been hijacked.
[00:57:20.862 --> 00:57:22.463]  Great points.
[00:57:22.463 --> 00:57:22.764]  You know what?
[00:57:22.764 --> 00:57:26.646]  I don't want to cut Jeff and Dave and JP and Paula short here.
[00:57:26.646 --> 00:57:27.867]  We're going to go to break here in a moment.
[00:57:28.427 --> 00:57:32.869]  And then I'm going to come back and continue with your calls straight through for the next 30 minutes.
[00:57:32.869 --> 00:57:36.431]  Then Dr. Jerome Corsi on the birth certificate is joining us.
[00:57:36.431 --> 00:57:37.392]  It is a forgery.
[00:57:37.392 --> 00:57:38.312]  There's no doubt about that.
[00:57:38.312 --> 00:57:39.133]  So why?
[00:57:39.133 --> 00:57:39.773]  Why?
[00:57:39.773 --> 00:57:40.554]  Why so shoddy?
[00:57:41.544 --> 00:57:43.465]  Before I go any further, I want to tell you about Interfood.
[00:57:43.465 --> 00:57:44.825]  We live in a toxic environment.
[00:57:44.825 --> 00:57:51.028]  Daily, we are bombarded with chemtrails, fluorides, radiation, pesticides, and other equally toxic chemicals.
[00:57:51.028 --> 00:58:04.114]  The great folks at Interfood, endorsed by Mike Adams, voted Best Superfood, have a revolutionary 100% organic green superfood energy drink with powerful nutrition, better health, energy, and immune system support.
[00:58:04.654 --> 00:58:10.141]  It's innerfood.com or 866-762-9238.
[00:58:10.141 --> 00:58:12.884]  They got a bunch of other great products.
[00:58:12.884 --> 00:58:15.888]  It's easy to digest and 100% absorbable by your body.
[00:58:15.888 --> 00:58:17.911]  866-762-9238 or innerfood.com, banners on infowars.com and prison.
[00:58:23.257 --> 00:58:25.698]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:52.130 --> 00:58:53.852]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:53.852 --> 00:58:59.159]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:58:59.159 --> 00:59:00.702]  Saving means to make money.
[00:59:00.702 --> 00:59:09.493]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:59:10.214 --> 00:59:17.737]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:59:17.737 --> 00:59:25.741]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:59:25.741 --> 00:59:30.983]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[00:59:30.983 --> 00:59:33.144]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[01:00:05.765 --> 01:00:10.607]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.607 --> 01:00:12.188]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.188 --> 01:00:13.728]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.728 --> 01:00:17.930]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.930 --> 01:00:21.992]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:29.932 --> 01:00:37.818]  Okay, continuing with your phone calls and some very important police state news in the next 30 minutes, the Dr. Jerome Corsi joins us.
[01:00:37.818 --> 01:00:39.919]  Let's talk to Jeff in Virginia.
[01:00:39.919 --> 01:00:41.120]  Jeff, thanks for holding.
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:42.961]  You're on the air.
[01:00:42.961 --> 01:00:45.183]  Hey Alex, how you doing today?
[01:00:45.183 --> 01:00:54.730]  Just wanted to say thank you so much for all that you do and I just want you to know that there's so many people that are behind you right now.
[01:00:54.730 --> 01:00:58.953]  This call is in relation to the TSA and I was wondering if
[01:00:59.628 --> 01:01:02.490]  I could ask your help or somebody's help that's listening right now.
[01:01:02.490 --> 01:01:17.121]  I asked the ACLU to help me, but they declined to help me on this, but basically I sent a Freedom of Information Act request on September 30th, 2010, and I wanted to read to you, if you would allow me, what the letter they sent back to me.
[01:01:17.121 --> 01:01:19.342]  They only sent one letter back to me.
[01:01:19.342 --> 01:01:20.463]  If that's okay, sir?
[01:01:20.463 --> 01:01:25.587]  Well, they tell you you're a pathetic slave and they don't follow federal law and don't have to tell you what they're up to?
[01:01:27.031 --> 01:01:43.340]  They said, uh, this acknowledges receipt of your September 30th, 2010 Freedom of Information Act request to the TSA for all records pertaining to how many millirems of radiation exposure that the TSA workers are being exposed to every day from TSA's naked body scanners.
[01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:52.886]  Also all records that TSA have pertaining to how many millirems of radiation exposure that every passenger is being exposed to every time that person flies by being subject to this technology.
[01:01:53.789 --> 01:01:55.970]  Uh, your request was received on October 13, 2010.
[01:01:55.970 --> 01:02:00.973]  Now it's been nine months and I've only received one letter back.
[01:02:00.973 --> 01:02:16.261]  And it says, uh, we are encountering delays, uh, citing a bunch of laws, and then it starts going into how they're going to charge me for records, uh, in accordance with the DHS FOIA regulations, and that they're going to charge me hourly rates,
[01:02:17.491 --> 01:02:28.501]  Yeah, they're not supposed to do that and what they'll do is they'll try to give you every document they ever printed and send you a million dollar bill and that's been challenged in court.
[01:02:28.501 --> 01:02:36.308]  The ACLU in Michigan a few weeks ago put in a request to get the documents on police randomly pulling people over, grabbing their cell phones, plugging them in.
[01:02:36.969 --> 01:02:39.030]  And stealing the content of their phone.
[01:02:39.030 --> 01:02:42.571]  And they tried to give the ACLU a million dollar bill.
[01:02:42.571 --> 01:02:45.813]  And it just shows how this government is trying to operate in secret.
[01:02:45.813 --> 01:02:51.695]  They wouldn't tell Congress for over a year the digital numbers on radiation from the scanners.
[01:02:51.695 --> 01:02:55.297]  And then when they were forced to, they released fake numbers and have now been caught.
[01:02:55.297 --> 01:02:59.759]  It is a group of lawless criminals who are power grabbing right now.
[01:02:59.759 --> 01:03:02.640]  But we need to get Bob Barr's group
[01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:12.162]  Uh, Liberty Guard back on for a 10 minute update or something, get Bob Barr himself on, because they were going to file a lawsuit if they didn't release the stuff.
[01:03:12.162 --> 01:03:13.622]  So we'll continue to look into that, Jeff.
[01:03:13.622 --> 01:03:16.303]  I'm glad you called.
[01:03:16.303 --> 01:03:18.944]  All of us seem to be, you know, looking into this.
[01:03:18.944 --> 01:03:27.066]  But we already know from the scanners, even the New York Times two years ago had top scientists 20 to 50 times the level they claim of radiation.
[01:03:27.066 --> 01:03:30.786]  So we already know it's frying people, especially the moron TSA.
[01:03:30.786 --> 01:03:32.567]  Dave in Florida, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:37.382]  Hey Alex, first time caller, long time listener.
[01:03:37.382 --> 01:03:40.083]  And you woke me up.
[01:03:40.083 --> 01:03:45.485]  I'm also a Christian, retired Air Force member.
[01:03:45.485 --> 01:03:47.526]  I went to church as a kid.
[01:03:47.526 --> 01:03:57.911]  I studied prophecy and that led me to have an understanding about this new world order and how it's going to affect our lives.
[01:03:57.911 --> 01:04:00.232]  And I've taken a lot of heat because of it.
[01:04:00.854 --> 01:04:06.619]  And because of you, you're waking other people up and they're saying, hey Dave, this makes a lot of sense.
[01:04:06.619 --> 01:04:11.763]  So what I do is I tie the prophecy from the Bible and you're, you know, what's happening currently.
[01:04:11.763 --> 01:04:16.706]  Yeah, that's right, because I don't push the Bible and push revelations but lay out what's happening.
[01:04:16.706 --> 01:04:27.815]  That, we've confirmed, leads a lot of people to wake up to the larger issues that this is a spiritual battle and the globalists are being basically directed by this primeval
[01:04:28.535 --> 01:04:34.977]  There's no doubt about it, and the globalists themselves understand that and say that, in their more internal writings.
[01:04:34.977 --> 01:04:38.158]  I'm gonna hold you over, Dave, so you can finish up your point.
[01:04:38.158 --> 01:04:44.380]  And they're using this whole pre-tribulation rapture as a way to get everybody to stand down.
[01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:47.441]  Then for secular people, they have the 2012 mumbo-jumbo.
[01:04:47.441 --> 01:04:51.642]  Folks that wouldn't believe in Christianity believe a twisted Mayan prophecy.
[01:04:51.642 --> 01:04:53.162]  And I don't do nothing!
[01:04:53.162 --> 01:04:54.283]  World's gonna end in 2012 anyways!
[01:04:55.623 --> 01:04:58.825]  Right as the Globalists try to finish their takeover in 2012.
[01:04:58.825 --> 01:05:02.248]  They want us to stand down.
[01:05:02.248 --> 01:05:06.270]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:05:06.270 --> 01:05:09.513]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:05:09.513 --> 01:05:14.676]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:05:14.676 --> 01:05:20.700]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:22.942]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:05:23.482 --> 01:05:24.964]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:05:24.964 --> 01:05:26.065]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:05:26.065 --> 01:05:28.488]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:05:42.386 --> 01:05:49.674]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:05:49.674 --> 01:05:58.784]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:06:00.839 --> 01:06:03.820]  It could never happen in America, but it's happening right now.
[01:06:03.820 --> 01:06:07.441]  Gas prices are exploding past the incomes of millions of families.
[01:06:07.441 --> 01:06:14.063]  As gas prices and crop failures push high food costs, you can still get the best food on the planet from eFoodsDirect.com.

[01:06:54.116 --> 01:07:00.785]  That's 800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:07:00.785 --> 01:07:01.946]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:07:01.946 --> 01:07:08.094]  citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:07:08.855 --> 01:07:11.416]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:07:11.416 --> 01:07:16.798]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:07:16.798 --> 01:07:19.840]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:22.160]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:28.403]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:07:28.403 --> 01:07:31.784]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:07:31.784 --> 01:07:33.185]  Recently, he created a video
[01:07:33.365 --> 01:07:33.745]  I don't know.
[01:08:01.551 --> 01:08:04.292]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:04.292 --> 01:08:13.157]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:13.157 --> 01:08:15.238]  We're opening the phones up right now.
[01:08:15.238 --> 01:08:23.281]  And if you just joined us, coming up in about 25 minutes, Dr. Jerome Courtsey is going to be live on air with us.
[01:08:23.281 --> 01:08:30.445]  The author of Where's the Birth Certificate that the White House had to respond to a month ago with Obama's press conference.
[01:08:31.752 --> 01:08:44.882]  They've now had hit pieces come out in Esquire saying that World Net Daily had said the book was a lie and was recalling it for the full retail price of the book, which is economic warfare.
[01:08:44.882 --> 01:08:47.584]  Not only is that a lie, but they sell the book for 50-60% off.
[01:08:49.545 --> 01:09:13.155]  to the bookstore so that was full retail price it wouldn't just be the cost of the book it would be the full retail designed to bankrupt them and then it also creates the rumor and the idea that oh even the publisher admits it's a fraud and they they're recalling it from the stores then people go back to the store saying you notice they waited till the book was out three days to do this hey I want my money back so then the
[01:09:14.915 --> 01:09:17.317]  Booksellers freak out and say, well, that's it.
[01:09:17.317 --> 01:09:19.159]  We're pulling these off the shelves.
[01:09:19.159 --> 01:09:21.761]  This was serious economic warfare.
[01:09:21.761 --> 01:09:26.585]  Why is the White House so scared using their surrogate of Esquire to do this?
[01:09:26.585 --> 01:09:32.430]  The White House also says this could be part of their campaign that Obama's made in America with t-shirts and coffee cups.
[01:09:32.430 --> 01:09:33.571]  That's all coming up now.
[01:09:34.532 --> 01:09:48.745]  Separate from that, they have Christian Radio Network and others in the last year saying the rapture will happen today on the other side of the planet, tomorrow here in North America and Western Europe.
[01:09:48.745 --> 01:09:53.989]  And when it doesn't happen, it'll just be further cannon fodder to discredit Christians.
[01:09:53.989 --> 01:09:54.630]  It is a 150-year-old dogma.
[01:09:56.952 --> 01:10:00.155]  That there's gonna be a pre-tribulation rapture.
[01:10:00.155 --> 01:10:11.705]  In Revelations, it says when Christ returns and whips the devil at the Battle of Armageddon and the archangel ties up the devil with a big chain and all that, that then the dead in Christ will be raised up.
[01:10:11.705 --> 01:10:14.868]  Okay, clearly a five-year-old could read it, it says that.
[01:10:14.868 --> 01:10:22.815]  I read the Bible verse earlier where it says, no man, not even the angels, not even the Son, only the Father knows when Christ will return.
[01:10:23.806 --> 01:10:29.109]  That's Matthew 24, 36, King James Version, every other version says the same thing.
[01:10:29.109 --> 01:10:30.829]  And these people don't care.
[01:10:30.829 --> 01:10:34.171]  And they did it in 87, 94, the same people.
[01:10:34.171 --> 01:10:35.652]  They're doing it again.
[01:10:35.652 --> 01:10:37.252]  And I'm tired of it.
[01:10:37.252 --> 01:10:40.034]  But you notice all the Hollywood movies about the world ending.
[01:10:41.054 --> 01:10:43.176]  Uh, in December of next year.
[01:10:43.176 --> 01:10:44.797]  All the new agers pushing it.
[01:10:44.797 --> 01:10:57.484]  This is a simple psychological warfare tactic to teach people that resisting and being involved is futile, that you don't control any of your destiny, that you can't do anything, just lay down and take it.
[01:10:58.425 --> 01:10:59.406]  It's over.
[01:10:59.406 --> 01:11:05.088]  They have all these best-selling books out about the end of history and the end of man and the world without man.
[01:11:05.088 --> 01:11:13.712]  I'm at the grocery store and see end caps with magazines and audiobooks from the secular view that mankind's all about to die.
[01:11:13.712 --> 01:11:24.457]  And I see no evidence of this anywhere but by the globalists gearing up underground bunkers, seed vaults, and saying themselves, once the planetary regime is in place,
[01:11:26.269 --> 01:11:34.565]  Once the planetary regime is in place, they're going to release airborne super plagues, a human version of mousepox that kills 99% of humans.
[01:11:37.329 --> 01:11:39.450]  And of course, they'll have the antidote.
[01:11:39.450 --> 01:11:52.136]  Now, that's a real group running the planet, setting up world government, waging war, setting up police state, saying that out in the future, once they've got their world government in place, they plan to kill us.
[01:11:52.136 --> 01:11:56.538]  Now, that's a real group saying this, and I've made films on it.
[01:11:56.538 --> 01:11:58.279]  I've had countless guests.
[01:11:58.279 --> 01:12:04.802]  We've got a special hour-plus documentary coming out just on White House documents dealing with this.
[01:12:07.534 --> 01:12:09.075]  I don't even know what to say.
[01:12:09.075 --> 01:12:15.280]  That's a special web documentary for PrisonPlanet.tv coming out next week.
[01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:20.504]  I haven't even decided on the exact title yet.
[01:12:20.504 --> 01:12:23.106]  Right now the trailer for it is Webster Tarpley.
[01:12:24.195 --> 01:12:25.035]  I said I'd go to your calls.
[01:12:25.035 --> 01:12:26.576]  I better go to them right now.
[01:12:26.576 --> 01:12:29.257]  But since I mentioned it, let me just give you the trailer.
[01:12:29.257 --> 01:12:30.737]  Trailer name.
[01:12:30.737 --> 01:12:32.497]  See if I can find it.
[01:12:32.497 --> 01:12:35.658]  I can't keep track of all this stuff anymore, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:12:35.658 --> 01:12:40.000]  All the trailers up on PrisonPlanet.TV if you want to see it.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.340]  But I live in the real world.
[01:12:41.340 --> 01:12:46.182]  That's why we've accurately predicted so much of what's happened.
[01:12:46.182 --> 01:12:47.462]  I'll find the Tarpley here in a minute.
[01:12:50.236 --> 01:12:50.676]  There it is.
[01:12:50.676 --> 01:12:53.638]  If you scroll up to the top, I can see the headline.
[01:12:53.638 --> 01:12:54.659]  Thank you.
[01:12:54.659 --> 01:12:55.079]  Trailer.
[01:12:55.079 --> 01:12:58.862]  Webster Tarpley and the Elite's Plan for Global Extermination.
[01:12:58.862 --> 01:13:00.663]  And this isn't conspiracy theories.
[01:13:00.663 --> 01:13:02.204]  It isn't fantasies.
[01:13:02.204 --> 01:13:16.313]  It is the official policy of every Western government's science czar and leader, and officially taught in every major establishment university, in the psychology department, biology department,
[01:13:19.332 --> 01:13:22.953]  Politics, political science, it's standard.
[01:13:22.953 --> 01:13:24.373]  Alright, I'm gonna shut up.
[01:13:24.373 --> 01:13:25.914]  Going back to your calls here.
[01:13:25.914 --> 01:13:36.316]  Finishing up your points, Jeff, about this attempted mainlining that the world is gonna end, so why stand up against corruption?
[01:13:36.316 --> 01:13:38.057]  Alex, this is Dave.
[01:13:38.057 --> 01:13:39.177]  Okay, Dave, go ahead, Dave.
[01:13:40.373 --> 01:13:50.056]  Hey, um, I really feel your pain and frustration because of, uh, the government's acceleration and blatant lying to us.
[01:13:50.056 --> 01:13:58.579]  But we, as good people, or Americans, have to know that this is a battle of good and evil.
[01:13:58.579 --> 01:14:02.720]  And Christians should not fear evil, because it's already been defeated.
[01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:07.042]  Have faith in his word, and not the world.
[01:14:07.042 --> 01:14:08.002]  And we will prevail.
[01:14:08.968 --> 01:14:11.388]  I agree with you and I appreciate your call, Dave.
[01:14:11.388 --> 01:14:13.809]  Sorry I got the calls out of order here.
[01:14:13.809 --> 01:14:23.671]  My issue is most churches, Christian, Catholic, you name it, I scan around on the dial, I listen to the religious channels on XM, it's the same thing.
[01:14:23.671 --> 01:14:25.051]  End of the world's come and lay down.
[01:14:25.051 --> 01:14:27.012]  End of the world's come and lay down.
[01:14:27.012 --> 01:14:30.072]  And so people just have this, I'm already dead, why should I?
[01:14:30.072 --> 01:14:32.713]  Okay, let the TSA stick their hands down my pants.
[01:14:32.713 --> 01:14:34.213]  Let the foreign bank steal everything.
[01:14:35.126 --> 01:14:42.133]  Okay, it's a self-fulfilling prophecy to be losers, and it's not in the Bible.
[01:14:42.133 --> 01:14:50.262]  And for all you secular people who don't believe in the Bible, why do you believe in a Mayan prophecy that isn't even what the Mayans said?
[01:14:50.262 --> 01:14:54.526]  See, they've tailored this for every audience.
[01:14:54.526 --> 01:14:56.068]  Let's go to JP in Maryland.
[01:14:56.068 --> 01:14:56.949]  JP, you're on the air.
[01:14:57.810 --> 01:14:59.751]  Hello Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:14:59.751 --> 01:15:01.191]  Thanks for calling.
[01:15:01.191 --> 01:15:06.714]  I'm one of the founders of the Annapolis Tea Party, and I'm friends with Joe C. Hewson.
[01:15:06.714 --> 01:15:08.574]  And I have a couple questions.
[01:15:08.574 --> 01:15:14.597]  How do we get Ron Paul supporters out there knocking on doors?
[01:15:14.597 --> 01:15:17.838]  That's one big thing I see that really needs to be done to get him elected.
[01:15:17.838 --> 01:15:22.980]  It has to be a real grassroots local knocking on doors, getting the information out there.
[01:15:23.769 --> 01:15:28.813]  The other question I have is how Romney raised all his money in that one day.
[01:15:28.813 --> 01:15:40.641]  Now, I'm a former Mormon, and at the Mormon church or the ward that you were in, the head of the ward would kind of tell you, when he got up to the pulpit, who you were going to vote for and who to donate for.
[01:15:40.641 --> 01:15:50.789]  And I wonder if there's any prepaid Mormon churches or wards that prepaid for his campaign.
[01:15:53.058 --> 01:15:53.618]  I don't know.
[01:15:53.618 --> 01:16:01.343]  All I know is Mitt Romney wrote the health care plan in Massachusetts that is now federal law.
[01:16:01.343 --> 01:16:07.086]  Newt Gingrich is a carbon tax world government lover, of course Republicans then love him.
[01:16:07.086 --> 01:16:09.468]  Mitt Romney is super bad news.
[01:16:10.348 --> 01:16:16.173]  And just like Obama got four times the money that John McCain got, it's not that John McCain was good either.
[01:16:16.173 --> 01:16:23.140]  It's that Obama was the man and you see the establishment early on getting behind Romney and that's all you need to know.
[01:16:23.140 --> 01:16:26.823]  A lot of that was big corporate donations.
[01:16:26.823 --> 01:16:30.767]  So I really appreciate your call, JP, on the issue of Ron Paul.
[01:16:34.232 --> 01:16:35.612]  Ron Paul wins either way.
[01:16:35.612 --> 01:16:47.334]  He's running, he's going to educate people about real issues, talk about the Federal Reserve, talk about the real ruling class in this country, talk about crony capitalism versus true free market.
[01:16:47.334 --> 01:16:52.235]  He's getting a lot more attention now than he got three years ago, and we need to get behind him.
[01:16:52.235 --> 01:16:55.956]  But as he will tell you, he's only one salvo in the fight.
[01:16:55.956 --> 01:16:58.776]  There's the state rights movement, nullification.
[01:16:58.776 --> 01:17:01.437]  We've got to fight at every level and every strata.
[01:17:02.057 --> 01:17:05.041]  And so, people need to get out there and start knocking on doors.
[01:17:05.041 --> 01:17:07.405]  I mean, you've got Rush, the big rock band.
[01:17:07.405 --> 01:17:16.117]  I was driving down the road this morning, dialing through, and I heard them talk a song talking about the New World Order and deception and control and...
[01:17:18.580 --> 01:17:23.084]  And then I got into the office and checked it, and sure enough, it's like a pro Ron Paul song.
[01:17:23.084 --> 01:17:29.029]  I mean, I'm telling you folks, there's a top hip-hop star that was interviewed.
[01:17:29.029 --> 01:17:29.849]  I mean, top guy.
[01:17:29.849 --> 01:17:31.170]  Hip-hop Hall of Fame.
[01:17:31.170 --> 01:17:33.592]  We're about to get him on the show.
[01:17:33.592 --> 01:17:36.455]  Just gave an interview to Luke Rodowski.
[01:17:36.455 --> 01:17:36.975]  What's his name again?
[01:17:37.876 --> 01:17:38.356]  Prodigy.
[01:17:38.356 --> 01:17:39.437]  Everybody knows who he is.
[01:17:39.437 --> 01:17:40.458]  I don't.
[01:17:40.458 --> 01:17:44.601]  But the point is, fan of this show, fan of Ron Paul, we're told.
[01:17:44.601 --> 01:17:45.641]  Just did an interview with Luke Rudowsky.
[01:17:45.641 --> 01:17:46.562]  We're going to be getting him on.
[01:17:46.562 --> 01:17:48.623]  I mean, it's just, it's massive.
[01:17:48.623 --> 01:17:50.625]  And it's about an idea.
[01:17:50.625 --> 01:17:52.986]  Ron Paul is just a focal point of that.
[01:17:52.986 --> 01:17:55.628]  Let's go ahead and talk to Paula in California.
[01:17:55.628 --> 01:17:56.528]  You're on the air.
[01:17:56.528 --> 01:17:57.089]  Thanks for holding.
[01:17:58.266 --> 01:17:59.767]  Hi, how are you?
[01:17:59.767 --> 01:18:04.428]  Well, first off, it's an honor to be speaking with you.
[01:18:04.428 --> 01:18:13.232]  I'm from Chile, South America, where my parents lived the dictatorship initiated and provoked by Kissinger's Black Mountain Project.
[01:18:13.772 --> 01:18:21.459]  And I just want to say that, um, from what I've learned and seen, it's not much different from the things that are happening in this country, you know?
[01:18:21.459 --> 01:18:23.260]  The invasion of privacy.
[01:18:23.260 --> 01:18:27.283]  It doesn't take much to put the pieces together, and people need to wake up.
[01:18:27.283 --> 01:18:28.424]  Well, it's like with Hitler.
[01:18:28.424 --> 01:18:29.265]  It's like with Hitler.
[01:18:29.265 --> 01:18:34.049]  It took him a good seven years to really get the tyranny rolling.
[01:18:34.049 --> 01:18:39.794]  And it's the same thing here, but now at a certain point, the pot goes from simmer to boil, the water's starting to boil.
[01:18:40.848 --> 01:19:02.004]  Well exactly and the signs are there like right in front of your face and if you know if you see them you have to do something about it but people here in this country are so quiet and they remain distracted and you know I know I'm preaching to the choir but it's frustrating because I'm 23 years old and and I talk to people with my age but
[01:19:02.404 --> 01:19:05.627]  They don't realize what's going on here in California.
[01:19:05.627 --> 01:19:09.670]  The immigration checkpoints are getting harder every day.
[01:19:09.670 --> 01:19:14.334]  You know, they're opening trunks and hoods and looking into your stuff.
[01:19:14.334 --> 01:19:18.077]  And by the way, they're doing it 50, 60 miles into the country.
[01:19:18.077 --> 01:19:27.325]  You know, they're leaving the real areas wide open, but then, yes, using the immigration checkpoint excuse to go after people that are in this country legally.
[01:19:28.450 --> 01:19:31.513]  Yeah, and you know there are like small things.
[01:19:31.513 --> 01:19:34.696]  The past Saturday, the U.S.
[01:19:34.696 --> 01:19:44.847]  Postal Service did this huge collection of perishable foods, you know, and you just have to be prepared for anything and people don't do that.
[01:19:44.847 --> 01:19:49.612]  So your family was down there where Pinochet was at in Chile then, correct?
[01:19:49.612 --> 01:19:50.493]  Yes, exactly.
[01:19:51.314 --> 01:19:55.656]  Wow, boy, he killed a lot of people, and our government helped finance that whole thing.
[01:19:55.656 --> 01:19:56.897]  Paula, great to hear from you.
[01:19:56.897 --> 01:19:59.979]  Stan, Jeremiah, Richard, and others, your call's coming up.
[01:19:59.979 --> 01:20:00.459]  Stay with us.

[01:20:44.149 --> 01:20:45.089]  The original since 1976.
[01:21:00.933 --> 01:21:02.735]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:21:02.735 --> 01:21:18.308]  The earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear disaster that killed thousands of Japanese citizens is nothing compared to the devastation that could be caused by hyperinflation that will soon hit the United States and could lead to millions of Americans becoming homeless, all caused by the devalued U.S.
[01:21:18.308 --> 01:21:18.648]  dollar.
[01:21:18.648 --> 01:21:28.356]  While the mainstream media continues to ignore inflation, our friends at the National Inflation Association provide a free weekly newsletter that educates Americans of the facts and truth about the U.S.
[01:21:28.356 --> 01:21:29.317]  economy and inflation.
[01:21:29.537 --> 01:21:39.652]  I urge you to sign up at the NIA's free newsletter at www.inflation.us to learn how you can not only survive, but prosper during the upcoming hyperinflation crisis.
[01:21:39.652 --> 01:21:45.240]  Silver has more than doubled since the NIA declared silver the best investment for the next decade on inflation.us.
[01:21:46.041 --> 01:21:55.512]  The NIA's team of expert economists are happy to answer any economic questions you have about inflation, debt, currencies, real estate, precious metals, and commodities.
[01:21:55.512 --> 01:22:00.477]  Visit inflation.us to learn the economic truth that the mainstream media ignores.
[01:22:01.098 --> 01:22:03.500]  Spring and a new growing season are here.

[01:22:30.561 --> 01:22:31.802]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:31.802 --> 01:22:36.365]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:22:36.365 --> 01:22:42.189]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:22:42.189 --> 01:22:45.811]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:22:45.811 --> 01:22:48.533]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:48.533 --> 01:22:53.596]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[01:24:10.052 --> 01:24:20.003]  Macho man Randy Savage had a heart attack in Florida on the highway and crashed his car over an embankment and died from injuries from that.
[01:24:20.003 --> 01:24:25.548]  But I guess these fake Christian cults probably say it's the rapture happening or something.
[01:24:28.539 --> 01:24:33.160]  Again, if you want to know who started the whole rapture movement, it was Masonic preachers.
[01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:35.701]  And I ought to do a whole show on this.
[01:24:35.701 --> 01:24:37.962]  Back in the 1850s, there were a couple of them.
[01:24:37.962 --> 01:24:46.164]  Let's go ahead and play a Mason going into a hospital, stopped by someone asking if he truly worships Lucifer and what he had to say.
[01:24:46.164 --> 01:24:46.844]  Here is the clip.
[01:24:47.386 --> 01:24:49.267]  Lucifer, what is your problem?
[01:24:49.267 --> 01:24:50.247]  Just that, sir.
[01:24:50.247 --> 01:24:51.347]  Okay.
[01:24:51.347 --> 01:24:52.808]  I'm a Christian, sir.
[01:24:52.808 --> 01:24:55.728]  I'm pure and virtuous and wholesome and innocent.
[01:24:55.728 --> 01:24:58.149]  How can you say anything about it about me?
[01:24:58.149 --> 01:25:00.070]  Sir, you need to be born again.
[01:25:00.070 --> 01:25:01.050]  I am born again.
[01:25:01.050 --> 01:25:03.151]  Now, did you just say that you're Lucifer?
[01:25:03.151 --> 01:25:03.811]  I am Lucifer.
[01:25:03.811 --> 01:25:05.611]  Okay, define Lucifer for me.
[01:25:05.611 --> 01:25:10.393]  Pure, virtuous, wholesome, innocent individual that's out to help people.
[01:25:10.393 --> 01:25:11.173]  Lucifer is?
[01:25:11.173 --> 01:25:11.313]  Yeah.
[01:25:12.194 --> 01:25:12.834]  Say that again.
[01:25:12.834 --> 01:25:16.158]  Lucifer is a pure, holy... Virtuous!
[01:25:16.158 --> 01:25:17.119]  Virtuous.
[01:25:17.119 --> 01:25:19.221]  Now, see the Lucifer that God created?
[01:25:19.221 --> 01:25:20.122]  That's the same one.
[01:25:20.122 --> 01:25:20.983]  Oh, man, this is great.
[01:25:20.983 --> 01:25:22.525]  I'm going to put this on the internet.
[01:25:22.525 --> 01:25:24.647]  Oh, God bless you, brother.
[01:25:24.647 --> 01:25:29.792]  Because that's exactly what the Shriners and Masons teach, is that Lucifer... Lucifer is light.
[01:25:29.792 --> 01:25:30.413]  No.
[01:25:30.413 --> 01:25:31.014]  And you're confirming it.
[01:25:31.014 --> 01:25:31.895]  What about those hospitals?
[01:25:32.575 --> 01:25:34.157]  You know what, sir?
[01:25:34.157 --> 01:25:39.182]  Jesus said, many will say to me on that day, Lord, Lord, we did not do these good deeds in your name.
[01:25:39.182 --> 01:25:41.464]  And you'll stay away from me, you workers of iniquity.
[01:25:41.464 --> 01:25:43.746]  I never knew you.
[01:25:43.746 --> 01:25:44.847]  Jesus said it?
[01:25:44.847 --> 01:25:45.548]  In Matthew chapter 5.
[01:25:47.788 --> 01:25:48.789]  Mercy.
[01:25:48.789 --> 01:25:49.250]  No.
[01:25:49.250 --> 01:25:50.411]  That's hard to believe.
[01:25:50.411 --> 01:25:53.334]  So, you're a Christian and you don't know that?
[01:25:53.334 --> 01:25:55.297]  No, I really am.
[01:25:55.297 --> 01:25:56.057]  Okay, that's enough.
[01:25:56.057 --> 01:25:56.878]  That's enough.
[01:25:56.878 --> 01:26:01.003]  The point is he thinks Lucifer is basically Jesus or two sides of the same coin.
[01:26:01.003 --> 01:26:05.268]  And I just want Masons to be honest about it because I've read the Albert Pike book, I've read the
[01:26:06.604 --> 01:26:14.210]  Morals and dogma, I've read the other big ones that they say are their Bibles, and Lucifer's God according to the high-level Masons.
[01:26:14.210 --> 01:26:15.611]  So low-level Masons should know this.
[01:26:15.611 --> 01:26:17.333]  Let's just be honest about it.
[01:26:17.333 --> 01:26:18.894]  Let's go to Patrick in England.
[01:26:18.894 --> 01:26:19.935]  Patrick, you're on the air.
[01:26:19.935 --> 01:26:21.856]  Welcome.
[01:26:21.856 --> 01:26:22.637]  Yes, hello Alex.
[01:26:22.637 --> 01:26:24.639]  I've been listening to you for a while.
[01:26:24.639 --> 01:26:27.081]  I know you've got lots of quarters, so I'll be very brief.
[01:26:27.081 --> 01:26:28.622]  Well, you're making your last phone call.
[01:26:28.622 --> 01:26:29.643]  The world's ending tomorrow.
[01:26:30.988 --> 01:26:35.769]  Oh, well yes, well I can tell you, I'm born again, I'm baptised, filled with the Spirit, speaking in tongues.
[01:26:35.769 --> 01:26:38.470]  Yes, by the way, I'll just tell you quickly what they do.
[01:26:38.470 --> 01:26:45.972]  They invented that doctrine by twisting Daniel's 70 weeks by detaching the 70th week of the 69th.
[01:26:45.972 --> 01:26:50.174]  And basically the 7 years, of which 3 and a half are days of years, that's 1260 years.
[01:26:51.654 --> 01:26:56.956]  Already fulfilled in prophecy, whereas the papacy persecuted the saints, basically.
[01:26:56.956 --> 01:27:03.379]  And, um, the mark of the beast, the mark on the hand, that's just symbolic of how the system would enslave members of the intelligentsia.
[01:27:03.379 --> 01:27:05.159]  You know, the mark on the head.
[01:27:05.159 --> 01:27:07.340]  The one on the hand would be the manual labourer.
[01:27:07.340 --> 01:27:08.541]  It's already been fulfilled.
[01:27:08.541 --> 01:27:09.581]  No one knows the day of the hour.
[01:27:09.581 --> 01:27:13.123]  But look, I want to quickly tell you, I've got an interesting book here in front of me.
[01:27:13.123 --> 01:27:13.963]  Roy Lifsey.
[01:27:14.643 --> 01:27:21.130]  Understanding the new world order, world government and world religion uncovering the new world order of George Bush.
[01:27:21.130 --> 01:27:23.712]  It was written 20 years ago in 1989.
[01:27:23.712 --> 01:27:29.058]  1989 it was written, therefore it cannot tell anything that's going to happen after that.
[01:27:29.058 --> 01:27:29.678]  It can't, you know...
[01:27:30.546 --> 01:27:36.870]  Basically, I've just got cast-iron proof here how the Bilderberg Group deliberately sets foreign policy.
[01:27:36.870 --> 01:27:42.054]  Because when the establishment gets challenged enough, it starts having to come out and starts having to admit it.
[01:27:42.054 --> 01:27:44.056]  Yeah, yeah, well, yeah, you're right.
[01:27:44.056 --> 01:27:45.276]  There is Bilderberg.
[01:27:45.276 --> 01:27:49.019]  Yeah, but it's just a meeting, just a, you know, a peer group.
[01:27:49.019 --> 01:27:50.460]  We just discuss problems.
[01:27:50.460 --> 01:27:52.882]  But back in 1989, they met off the coast
[01:27:53.627 --> 01:27:59.890]  Yeah, no, that's Jim Tucker of The Spotlight is now American Free Press.
[01:28:18.118 --> 01:28:36.883]  And yes, he did predict almost a year before she had to step down that they would force her out and the fall of the Berlin Wall and that Bush would endorse global warming and everything else because it is a meeting of the superclass and the people that really do, to a great extent, control the world.
[01:28:36.883 --> 01:28:40.804]  They're just attempting to fully control it right now.
[01:28:40.804 --> 01:28:42.885]  So I hear what you're saying.
[01:28:42.885 --> 01:28:44.225]  Anything else, Patrick?
[01:28:45.469 --> 01:28:59.872]  But that's proof that the Bilderberg Group sets foreign policy, because I'm well aware here in London of the article that came out a few months ago in The Economist, when they had to start admitting it, that yes, it exists, but we're not really in control.
[01:28:59.872 --> 01:29:05.374]  Yeah, yeah, we just discussed this, but obviously there's obviously an inner core that actually set deliberate foreign policy.
[01:29:05.374 --> 01:29:07.254]  Look, I appreciate your call.
[01:29:07.254 --> 01:29:10.475]  They had the Financial Times of London two years ago come out with
[01:29:12.273 --> 01:29:18.456]  One of their main editors, their international affairs editor, and now for world government.
[01:29:18.456 --> 01:29:22.899]  You just type in and now for world government FT, Financial Times.
[01:29:22.899 --> 01:29:25.780]  And he said, well, yes, we are authoritarian.
[01:29:25.780 --> 01:29:29.302]  It has been secret because you're too stupid to enjoy it.
[01:29:29.302 --> 01:29:31.883]  And we do need an authoritarian world government.
[01:29:31.883 --> 01:29:34.265]  And since then, they've had all these big environmental leaders.
[01:29:35.410 --> 01:29:37.671]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:37.671 --> 01:29:39.452]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:02.284 --> 01:30:04.006]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:30:04.006 --> 01:30:09.310]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:30:09.310 --> 01:30:10.832]  Saving means to make money.

[01:30:27.906 --> 01:30:35.913]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.

[01:31:01.752 --> 01:31:17.220]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:31:17.220 --> 01:31:20.902]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:21.912 --> 01:31:34.684]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:31:34.684 --> 01:31:41.950]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:31:42.631 --> 01:31:53.003]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.

[01:32:00.652 --> 01:32:05.213]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:32:05.213 --> 01:32:06.114]  Number 1.
[01:32:06.114 --> 01:32:09.555]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:09.555 --> 01:32:10.415]  Number 2.
[01:32:10.415 --> 01:32:15.297]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:15.297 --> 01:32:16.037]  It's true.
[01:32:16.037 --> 01:32:20.918]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:20.918 --> 01:32:21.739]  Number 3.
[01:32:21.739 --> 01:32:25.320]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:29.001]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:29.221 --> 01:32:30.021]  Number 4.
[01:32:30.021 --> 01:32:32.782]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:32.782 --> 01:32:36.463]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:32:36.463 --> 01:32:37.263]  Number 5.
[01:32:37.263 --> 01:32:41.404]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:32:41.404 --> 01:32:46.446]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:32:46.446 --> 01:32:50.627]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:50.627 --> 01:32:52.408]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:32:57.369 --> 01:32:58.610]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:32:58.610 --> 01:33:08.379]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:33:23.915 --> 01:33:30.523]  Okay, Dr. Jerome Corsi during the break when I got him on line here.
[01:33:32.250 --> 01:33:35.751]  To be a guest, dropped a big bombshell on me.
[01:33:35.751 --> 01:33:45.792]  He has got it narrowed down to even who needs to be looked at concerning this birth certificate.
[01:33:45.792 --> 01:33:49.113]  This is obviously bombshell stuff.
[01:33:49.113 --> 01:33:51.293]  We've got Bob Chapman coming up.
[01:33:51.293 --> 01:33:55.914]  Doc could even do an hour with us, but I don't want to keep short shrifting Bob Chapman.
[01:33:55.914 --> 01:33:59.595]  But I definitely want to get Dr. Corsi back up next week as well.
[01:34:00.435 --> 01:34:03.207]  But for those that just joined us...
[01:34:06.107 --> 01:34:08.948]  In the last three years, I've looked at the birth certificate thing.
[01:34:08.948 --> 01:34:14.910]  I found it curious that they spent over $2 million now blocking the release of the long form.
[01:34:14.910 --> 01:34:24.814]  They had Chris Matthews and others with talking points say there is no long form, it doesn't exist, that the receipt was the long form.
[01:34:24.814 --> 01:34:31.117]  Then, responding to Dr. Corsi's book a month ago, ahead of its publication, where is the birth certificate?
[01:34:31.897 --> 01:34:32.097]  I think?
[01:34:54.089 --> 01:35:03.616]  The latest developments, but now I'm getting even more sure that they're running scared and that the research of Dr. Corsi and others is spot-on.
[01:35:03.616 --> 01:35:08.259]  Now, Dr. Corsi's been to Kenya, he's traveled all over Hawaii, you name it.
[01:35:09.099 --> 01:35:28.148]  Really trying to get to the bottom of this and just a year ago or six months ago He wasn't sure he just said clearly there's evidence of a cover-up swing to look at it But but now he's coming out and saying that he's sure it's a composite of other real birth certificates That he and now is getting hot on the trail of who he believes
[01:35:30.189 --> 01:35:35.233]  May know something about where this newest birth certificate came from.
[01:35:35.233 --> 01:35:42.919]  We have the headline from yesterday, birther bombshell Corsi to release evidence proving Obama certificate a fraud composite.
[01:35:42.919 --> 01:35:53.987]  But then two days ago, we see Esquire come out and run a headline breaking in their politics section, not their humor section, Jerome Corsi's birther book pulled from shelves.
[01:35:53.987 --> 01:35:58.511]  Now, that's obviously done to create the perception it's discredited by the publisher.
[01:36:00.272 --> 01:36:04.194]  So people have runs on the bookstores and say, I want my money back.
[01:36:04.194 --> 01:36:06.216]  So they get scared and pull the book.
[01:36:06.216 --> 01:36:08.777]  It is extreme economic espionage.
[01:36:08.777 --> 01:36:16.042]  Then, five, six hours after it's published, they come out at the bottom and bury in a paragraph, this was satire.
[01:36:16.042 --> 01:36:22.626]  When clearly it was put out to damage them, World Net Daily Books, Dr. Jerome Corsi, Joseph Farah.
[01:36:22.626 --> 01:36:24.847]  This shows desperate, desperate,
[01:36:25.748 --> 01:36:26.068]  I think?
[01:36:42.066 --> 01:36:48.832]  Well, great to be with you, Alex, and I've never in my life seen the White House attack, attempt to suppress or censor a book as strong as mine.
[01:37:09.662 --> 01:37:17.545]  Now the Democratic National Party and the President's Re-Election Committee are sending out this newsletter, this letter, soliciting funds.
[01:37:17.545 --> 01:37:20.686]  They mentioned me by name in the first sentence.
[01:37:20.686 --> 01:37:22.606]  They vilified the book.
[01:37:22.606 --> 01:37:27.808]  They even sent the letter to me, addressing me to give them funds.
[01:37:27.808 --> 01:37:29.929]  Of course, I sent them some money and got a mug.
[01:37:29.929 --> 01:37:31.490]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:37:31.490 --> 01:37:32.530]  This type of attempt
[01:37:33.126 --> 01:37:36.809]  To suppress a book is counter to the First Amendment.
[01:37:36.809 --> 01:37:49.940]  And what it shows is that the information in this book, I've said this from the beginning, the White House, the Obama administration will not survive if the American people read what's in this book and understand it.
[01:37:52.298 --> 01:37:54.039]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[01:37:54.039 --> 01:37:55.759]  Where do you want to start?
[01:37:55.759 --> 01:38:03.702]  Let's start with a recap of the old birth certificate they claimed was the original and no other long-form existed.
[01:38:03.702 --> 01:38:05.842]  Then they flip-flopped there.
[01:38:05.842 --> 01:38:10.264]  Now we've got the proof that this new one is a joke-level fraud.
[01:38:10.264 --> 01:38:12.084]  A joke-level fraud.
[01:38:12.084 --> 01:38:14.065]  And, you know, I want to make two points, Alex.
[01:38:14.065 --> 01:38:21.367]  First of all, if this new long-form birth certificate existed, why wasn't it released
[01:38:22.535 --> 01:38:24.077]  Three years ago.
[01:38:24.077 --> 01:38:28.861]  Why don't we have this instead of the short-form Certificate of Live Birth?
[01:38:28.861 --> 01:38:42.073]  And Alex, I got a call about three weeks before it was released from one of my sources in Hawaii, and I was told that the new long-form birth certificate had been forged.
[01:38:42.073 --> 01:38:44.535]  It had been flipped into the logbook.
[01:38:44.535 --> 01:38:47.678]  We actually had somebody go into the logbook and read it to us.
[01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:50.302]  I knew it said Capulani.
[01:38:50.302 --> 01:38:52.244]  I knew it said Dr. Sinclair.
[01:38:52.244 --> 01:38:55.006]  And I documented all that with Joseph Barron and email.
[01:38:55.006 --> 01:39:01.112]  And I said, we better get out front and say that it's likely to be a forgery.
[01:39:01.112 --> 01:39:03.574]  But we all decided, hey, this is great.
[01:39:03.574 --> 01:39:12.202]  If the book smokes out Obama and, you know, they blink, they feel fear, they have to respond to try to destroy the book.
[01:39:12.202 --> 01:39:13.583]  Now we've got Barack Obama.
[01:39:15.867 --> 01:39:23.731]  This is like Nixon coming out and lying in the press conference and saying that he wasn't involved in the break-in.
[01:39:32.875 --> 01:39:35.238]  Let me stop you for a moment.
[01:39:35.238 --> 01:39:40.323]  You mentioned the fact that why didn't they bring this out three years ago and say that no long form existed?
[01:39:48.271 --> 01:40:00.616]  Why did Abercrombie get into office, the new governor of Hawaii, and say, I'm going to go down there and release it, and then tell two newspapers, as you reported, but mainline papers there in Hawaii, that I looked for it and couldn't find it.
[01:40:00.616 --> 01:40:03.457]  This is, quote, going to be a problem in the upcoming election.
[01:40:03.457 --> 01:40:14.061]  And then magically, it does pop up, and you've got moles inside of there, because you've already been there snooping around, that tells you, hey, guess what, Dr. Corsi?
[01:40:14.061 --> 01:40:16.862]  It looks like I, Dream of Jeannie, made it appear in there.
[01:40:17.142 --> 01:40:36.007]  Well, and, you know, I think the falsification occurred between the time when Abercrombie could not find any evidence of a long-form birth certificate, and we had that Michael Evans come out and say so, the celebrity reporter from Hollywood, saying he talked to Abercrombie and Abercrombie could not find the long-form.
[01:40:36.007 --> 01:40:41.028]  That's when the foragers started to work seriously, knowing my book was coming out.
[01:40:41.688 --> 01:40:53.870]  And by the way, Donald Trump, I discount, I'm completely convinced at this point Donald Trump was subterfuge that he, you know, I talked, he called me two or three times, got me to give him a copy of the book in advance.
[01:40:53.870 --> 01:41:01.912]  I'm convinced Donald Trump was, you know, through Mike Cohen, it seems to be 50-50 working with Obama.
[01:41:01.912 --> 01:41:03.692]  Close to Schumer.
[01:41:03.692 --> 01:41:06.973]  So Donald Trump says, let's beat the drums big, then you release the
[01:41:07.682 --> 01:41:14.966]  First certificate, I'll say satisfies me, the press will go to sleep, and I'll get my new $60 million contract.
[01:41:14.966 --> 01:41:16.327]  Well I'll tell you the dead ringer.
[01:41:16.327 --> 01:41:19.408]  He'll get his new $60 million NBC contract.
[01:41:19.408 --> 01:41:20.589]  Which is GE.
[01:41:20.589 --> 01:41:25.531]  Which is GE, which got bailout money and Rachel Maddow and all of them, but expanding.
[01:41:25.531 --> 01:41:26.192]  Here's the dead ringer.
[01:41:27.522 --> 01:41:32.464]  The two days after he's, quote, discredited by Obama, he goes into a cussing tirade.
[01:41:32.464 --> 01:41:39.107]  He's a very shrewd guy, meant to further plunge him in the numbers and to further discredit.
[01:41:39.107 --> 01:41:45.890]  And by the way, I'm going to watch very carefully and see if Donald Trump pops up to build the casinos in Chicago.
[01:41:45.890 --> 01:41:55.054]  Now that Rahm Emanuel's there, another tall building in Chicago, I'll be there investigating the connections with the White House and what deals, wink, wink, went back how far.
[01:41:55.054 --> 01:41:56.215]  I don't trust it at all.
[01:41:57.285 --> 01:42:00.066]  You don't trust a guy that owns a bunch of casinos.
[01:42:00.066 --> 01:42:01.547]  Everybody knows those are the good guys.
[01:42:01.547 --> 01:42:08.029]  Look, I also want to show you, we found, have you focused on the stamp of the Alvin Onaka stamp?
[01:42:08.029 --> 01:42:12.851]  I want just a quick, simple way to show people how comical this fraud is.
[01:42:12.851 --> 01:42:19.514]  You know, I showed that the stamp, state registrar's stamp, has a misspelling in it.
[01:42:19.514 --> 01:42:22.795]  Instead of the record, it's T-X-E record.
[01:42:23.502 --> 01:42:26.725]  Now, nobody uses a stamp with a misspelling in it.
[01:42:26.725 --> 01:42:36.373]  And then if you blow up to about 800%, and look at the signature Alvin T. Onaka, in the A, there is a smiley face.
[01:42:37.845 --> 01:42:44.691]  I assure you, I've looked, Alex, at hundreds of Elvin Onaka signatures and hundreds of stamps.
[01:42:44.691 --> 01:42:54.799]  None of them have a misspelling, TXE, and none of them have a smiley face in the A. But sir, that's my next point, is that they took it and put it on this green paper.
[01:42:54.799 --> 01:42:59.443]  The AP's put out two different versions that don't have the green hash paper.
[01:42:59.443 --> 01:43:03.326]  You've got the situation where it's clearly a computer
[01:43:04.286 --> 01:43:05.347]  Copying a typewriter?
[01:43:19.659 --> 01:43:29.849]  That's impossible with a typewriter because every new strike is like a snowflake or a fingerprint because it's how hard you hit the key, how it strikes the ribbon, the position of the paper.
[01:43:29.849 --> 01:43:34.794]  There's little, when it's blown up, microscopic ink blobs around it.
[01:43:34.794 --> 01:43:37.737]  You can't have identical same letters.
[01:43:37.737 --> 01:43:42.482]  That is only done by a computer that's designed to have fonts that look like typewriters.
[01:43:42.810 --> 01:43:53.330]  Well and you know, the administration will not show the original, 1961 there weren't any computers, where is the original paper birth certificate if it exists?
[01:43:53.948 --> 01:43:55.929]  Submitted to forensic analysis.
[01:43:55.929 --> 01:43:57.770]  I was in Hawaii last week.
[01:43:57.770 --> 01:43:58.991]  I went to see it.
[01:43:58.991 --> 01:44:01.392]  No one in the Hawaii Department of Health would talk to me.
[01:44:01.392 --> 01:44:04.334]  I went over to Kapi'olani Hospital.
[01:44:04.334 --> 01:44:08.956]  I said, okay, if Ann Dunham was here, I'd like to see the patient record for Ann Dunham.
[01:44:08.956 --> 01:44:11.537]  I've known for years they don't exist.
[01:44:11.537 --> 01:44:14.179]  Ann Dunham was never a patient of that hospital.
[01:44:14.179 --> 01:44:17.901]  Hospital threatened if I didn't vacate the premises, they would call the police.
[01:44:17.901 --> 01:44:21.703]  Now, if I were administrator of that hospital, I'd have a little shrine in the front.
[01:44:22.364 --> 01:44:39.036]  Celebrating that this was the birth hospital of the President, instead of continuing the cover-up by refusing to answer any questions or providing to the public the corroborating evidence that Ann Dunham had been in that hospital to give birth to Barack Obama.
[01:44:39.036 --> 01:44:43.179]  Let's look at the computer manipulation of the text.
[01:44:43.179 --> 01:44:45.280]  You had an article at WorldNetDaily about that.
[01:44:45.280 --> 01:44:45.701]  Yes, well...
[01:44:46.383 --> 01:44:49.648]  Would you take a look at the text of this thing and you blow it up?
[01:44:49.648 --> 01:44:55.537]  First of all, I mean, you could even start with the number on the upper right, the 10641.
[01:44:55.537 --> 01:44:58.442]  Which, by the way, is an out-of-sequence number, an impossible one.
[01:44:58.442 --> 01:44:59.664]  You blow it up and look at it.
[01:45:00.259 --> 01:45:14.887]  The 1 is clearly a JPEG, a photograph dropped in there, and the pixelization around the 1 shows the attempt did not repair it very well, so it's still obvious whoever did that did not understand how to repixelate.
[01:45:14.887 --> 01:45:18.869]  That's clear that the 1 is a JPEG and the rest of the number is not.
[01:45:18.869 --> 01:45:24.572]  Now, 10641 is impossible to be Barack Obama's first certificate number.
[01:45:24.572 --> 01:45:26.853]  Obama was registered on August 8th,
[01:45:27.854 --> 01:45:37.957]  And that, when it was registered on August 8th, the number was stamped with an old, one of the increment by number counters.
[01:45:37.957 --> 01:45:38.277]  10641.
[01:45:38.277 --> 01:45:42.519]  The Nordyke twins were born a day later in the hospital, August 5th.
[01:45:42.519 --> 01:45:46.440]  They were registered three days later, August 11th.
[01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:51.002]  And they were given numbers 10637 and 10638.
[01:45:51.002 --> 01:45:52.502]  It's impossible.
[01:45:52.502 --> 01:45:55.343]  Because that counter does not reverse.
[01:45:56.261 --> 01:46:04.448]  And three days earlier, registered, Obama would have had to have a lower number, maybe by 20, from the Nordyke twin.
[01:46:04.448 --> 01:46:16.537]  So the number itself, going back to the short form, was fraudulently, they miscalculated, they got the wrong number, they were stuck with that number, so the number is also wrong in the long form birth certificate.
[01:46:16.537 --> 01:46:19.920]  And then there's not the proper stamp that all the others have, I mean there's over 50...
[01:46:22.289 --> 01:46:22.810]  No seal.
[01:46:22.810 --> 01:46:24.211]  No seal.
[01:46:24.211 --> 01:46:27.753]  Then here's the $64 million question.
[01:46:27.753 --> 01:46:31.716]  Why did they put out such a clearly shoddy version?
[01:46:31.716 --> 01:46:47.547]  Not just the layers, because you do have some layering in these different computer programs like Illustrator, but what the computer then witnesses is if the computer sees the six, seven, eight, nine different layers, it sees the manipulation and then automatically sorts it
[01:46:48.547 --> 01:46:58.771]  The biggest issue here, and what all the Photoshop people in my office and outside groups have pointed out, is that normally, with a scan, you would have one gradient of pixelation.
[01:46:58.771 --> 01:47:04.933]  Instead, it is a cornucopia of different areas with high-res over low-res.
[01:47:04.933 --> 01:47:08.814]  I mean, this... I don't believe that they could be this shoddy, is what I'm saying.
[01:47:08.814 --> 01:47:15.476]  Well, I think, you know, Alex, if you're the president and you want to forge your birth certificate, you can't put out a request for proposal.
[01:47:16.097 --> 01:47:18.988]  And get the best guy in the country to come do the job.
[01:47:18.988 --> 01:47:21.096]  They were stuck with the guys who were close to them.
[01:47:21.798 --> 01:47:29.342]  And I'm pretty well on the trail of linking the characteristics of this document to someone who's going to have a lot of explaining to do.
[01:47:29.342 --> 01:47:36.305]  And I think when you see what I'm about to point out next week, we're hot on the trail of somebody who may have had a hand in this.
[01:47:36.305 --> 01:47:42.648]  Now, Dr. Corsi, let me just stop you there because you offered during the break, you said, I think I may break who this person is on your show.
[01:47:42.648 --> 01:47:49.391]  And I was like, first, tell us some of the proof and take us on the trail close to the person of interest.
[01:47:49.691 --> 01:48:09.666]  I'm just going to give you the hint, because I don't want to give it too far away, but there are characteristics in the long-form birth certificate as it's released, and in the work of another person, where signature items were put into the certificate of live birth to identify the forger.
[01:48:09.666 --> 01:48:14.009]  And the forger is someone who does not work in government, he works in the media.
[01:48:14.716 --> 01:48:25.581]  And it's close to the administration and would have been within the circle of friends that may have been called on to do the forgery or participate in the forgery.
[01:48:25.581 --> 01:48:39.407]  So I'm going to point out the signature characteristics of the work of this person, the signature characteristics in the document itself, and we're going to ask the public to draw their own conclusions of the person to come forth and explain why those characteristics are there.
[01:48:40.757 --> 01:48:50.161]  So you've looked at this individual's signature and then you've noticed that it appears... The way they do their work and the way that their signatures are embedded in this document.
[01:48:50.161 --> 01:49:03.526]  You know, every forger, it's like, you know, a forger wants their Mona Lisa to hang in an art gallery in the Louvre, but they want down the road for some expert to notice a flaw or a signature element.
[01:49:03.986 --> 01:49:10.056]  Where he says, this is not the Mona Lisa, this is done by so-and-so, so the forger wants to be identified.
[01:49:10.056 --> 01:49:18.669]  By the way, in using that analogy, the certificate of live birth that the White House released is kind of like a Mona Lisa by numbers.
[01:49:18.669 --> 01:49:19.450]  It's that crude.
[01:49:22.367 --> 01:49:25.788]  And you also have discovered initials in the signature, correct?
[01:49:25.788 --> 01:49:26.308]  Well, yes.
[01:49:26.308 --> 01:49:30.269]  We've got initials.
[01:49:30.269 --> 01:49:35.311]  I'm on the track of the person, I think, that was deeply involved when this was done.
[01:49:35.311 --> 01:49:45.894]  And I think we're going to be able to pin this down, not just that it's a forgery, but to look at the chain from which the forgery came from within the White House.
[01:49:45.894 --> 01:49:48.955]  And I should be able to have this evidence done next week.
[01:49:48.955 --> 01:49:49.595]  Also, Alex,
[01:49:50.245 --> 01:49:53.788]  I've been releasing, and I will continue to release next week.
[01:49:53.788 --> 01:49:58.032]  We could talk about even releasing some of it through you.
[01:49:58.032 --> 01:50:04.719]  The documents I've got from Kenya, which show that the grandmother's been saying Obama was born there for years.
[01:50:05.367 --> 01:50:07.388]  Well, that's breaking here right now!
[01:50:29.258 --> 01:50:29.958]  Right.
[01:50:29.958 --> 01:50:32.360]  And I've got the internal reports from the government.
[01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:43.206]  They identified Lady Grig Hospital, a division of what was essentially Mombasa General Hospital, where they focused their investigation to believe the baby was born.
[01:50:43.206 --> 01:50:50.631]  But the government of Kenya concluded, the intelligence service, that the family of Obama was trying to hide an important birth fact.
[01:50:51.235 --> 01:50:55.056]  They believed the grandmother that he was born in Kenya.
[01:50:55.056 --> 01:50:59.977]  They searched and they identified criminal tampering with the birth record.
[01:50:59.977 --> 01:51:09.158]  Not random criminal tampering, but tampering so as to hide or destroy Obama's birth record to Kenya.
[01:51:09.158 --> 01:51:11.279]  And you are going to produce proof from the government?
[01:51:11.279 --> 01:51:13.779]  I've got proof from Kenyan documents.
[01:51:13.779 --> 01:51:16.100]  And I can work to get them to your producer.
[01:51:16.100 --> 01:51:18.360]  We're going to be publishing them at World Net Daily.
[01:51:19.181 --> 01:51:20.942]  Wow, when is that bombshell going to drop?
[01:51:20.942 --> 01:51:24.845]  I'll be happy to work with you on that starting Monday.
[01:51:24.845 --> 01:51:31.670]  Okay, uh, clearly, I mean, they've been covering up, they've been acting suspicious.
[01:51:31.670 --> 01:51:33.431]  We got the document the day they released it.
[01:51:33.431 --> 01:51:36.754]  We hoped it was real, because quite frankly, you know, I'm sick of this.
[01:51:36.754 --> 01:51:38.635]  I want to go against his record.
[01:51:38.635 --> 01:51:42.598]  But then... But Alex, I want to say, you have done such a great job with your videos.
[01:51:43.283 --> 01:51:57.448]  You've done such, you know, World Net Daily has been leading this, but I'm going to reach out to the Alex Jones Show and I'm going to share with you some material so that in your next videos you've got the primary documents and primary work that we're producing at World Net Daily.
[01:51:57.448 --> 01:52:05.030]  I'm going to make a special effort on this one because you've so impressed me with the extent to which you've exposed this with your videos and your radio show.
[01:52:05.643 --> 01:52:06.583]  Well, thank you.
[01:52:06.583 --> 01:52:11.384]  I need to give you, then, my video editor's email, and then perhaps we can even... We'll do all that offline.
[01:52:11.384 --> 01:52:15.605]  Let's get all that done offline, and we'll start getting things together next week.
[01:52:15.605 --> 01:52:16.245]  Absolutely.
[01:52:16.245 --> 01:52:21.186]  Now, the issue I was getting to is that where there's smoke, there's fire.
[01:52:21.186 --> 01:52:27.447]  The evidence of the cover-up, as criminologists will tell you, is generally evidence of the crime.
[01:52:27.447 --> 01:52:30.408]  The absconding, the evasion that's going on.
[01:52:30.408 --> 01:52:34.729]  To have Esquire, who I've noticed, particularly with Obama, is their attack dog... I agree with that.
[01:52:35.089 --> 01:52:40.710]  Come out with a serious economic warfare, vicious espionage.
[01:52:40.710 --> 01:52:42.110]  I mean, that's what it is.
[01:52:42.110 --> 01:52:47.932]  An attempt to discredit, destroy, have a recall, a run to return the book.
[01:52:47.932 --> 01:52:54.693]  The same day they announced they're going to run on the birth certificate and that we're all a bunch of crazy kooks.
[01:52:54.693 --> 01:52:58.434]  This shows that they know this issue isn't going away and they're scared.
[01:52:58.434 --> 01:53:02.475]  I mean, if they knew this wasn't true, they would have just gone forward.
[01:53:02.475 --> 01:53:03.955]  So break down.
[01:53:04.292 --> 01:53:24.000]  Look, I've got, Alex, in the book I've got 125 exhibits, including the mother's passport records, where she crosses off Obama's name to take him off her passport in Indonesia, indicates his Indonesian name, Soibarka, the school records, where in Indonesia he's Barry Sartoro.
[01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:29.802]  The administration cannot tolerate if people read this book and see these exhibits.
[01:53:29.802 --> 01:53:31.283]  It destroys, this is a,
[01:53:32.446 --> 01:53:37.170]  Barack Obama, he was adopted in Indonesia, is no longer a natural-born citizen.
[01:53:37.170 --> 01:53:39.312]  He's a dual citizen.
[01:53:39.312 --> 01:53:45.637]  All the research and evidence I show that Ann Dunham left Hawaii three weeks after the baby was born.
[01:53:45.637 --> 01:53:56.065]  I've got the college transcripts, I've got the courses she took, the university saying these were night courses, the apartment where she stayed, the babysitter to interview.
[01:53:56.065 --> 01:54:00.269]  Ann Dunham did not return to Hawaii until after Barack Obama left.
[01:54:00.959 --> 01:54:01.820]  Barack Obama Sr.
[01:54:01.820 --> 01:54:02.621]  left.
[01:54:02.621 --> 01:54:03.522]  Barack Obama Sr.
[01:54:03.522 --> 01:54:04.823]  was never married to Ann Dunham.
[01:54:04.823 --> 01:54:08.026]  There was never a marriage ceremony, never a marriage license.
[01:54:08.026 --> 01:54:10.929]  They never lived together as man and woman.
[01:54:10.929 --> 01:54:23.462]  Ann Dunham had been messing around, spending time at Bill Lederer's bar on Hotel Street in Honolulu, got pregnant, decided she wanted Barack Obama Sr.
[01:54:23.462 --> 01:54:24.163]  to be the father.
[01:54:24.924 --> 01:54:32.412]  He wasn't real interested except that it might help him with his immigration and nationalization status to extend his stay in the United States.
[01:54:32.412 --> 01:54:36.017]  He lent his name but didn't commit to ceremony.
[01:54:36.017 --> 01:54:45.487]  And Anne Dunham herself ran off to Africa without him in the attempt to convince the African family that she deserved to be their princess.
[01:54:45.487 --> 01:54:46.148]  It didn't work.
[01:54:46.829 --> 01:54:58.339]  When she got home, Barack Obama still did not want to be her husband, and so she packed up baby, three weeks later, went off to Seattle and was at the University of Washington in Seattle.
[01:54:58.339 --> 01:54:59.200]  That's what happened.
[01:55:00.074 --> 01:55:16.281]  And so you're, what you're saying from your deep research and traveling all over the world, you have all the proof here in the book that by the way we sell at Infowars.com on the online video bookstore shopping cart, you're saying that not only are they trying to cover up the fact that he was born in Kenya, but that he's a bastard.
[01:55:16.281 --> 01:55:22.524]  Yes, and that the whole circumstance is told in Dreams for My Father, the fabrication.
[01:55:22.524 --> 01:55:25.986]  Mommy and Daddy never lived together in Honolulu.
[01:55:26.835 --> 01:55:29.736]  Abercrombie never saw this little family together.
[01:55:29.736 --> 01:55:35.617]  People at the university never visited with the, you know, Obama family and baby.
[01:55:35.617 --> 01:55:45.500]  Because mommy and baby, three weeks after the baby was born, are in Seattle and don't come back to Hawaii until after Barack Obama is gone.
[01:55:45.500 --> 01:55:46.320]  Barack Obama Sr.'
[01:55:46.300 --> 01:55:47.761]  's gone.
[01:55:47.761 --> 01:55:51.421]  I've got all the, I've got eight or nine articles published in the newspapers.
[01:55:51.421 --> 01:55:53.182]  This was the first African student
[01:55:53.809 --> 01:56:02.895]  Coming to the University of Hawaii, you'd think the local story would be, you know, African comes to the University of Hawaii, meets local girl, gets married, has baby.
[01:56:02.895 --> 01:56:04.096]  No.
[01:56:04.096 --> 01:56:06.497]  I've got all the addresses where Barack Obama Sr.
[01:56:06.497 --> 01:56:06.677]  lived.
[01:56:06.677 --> 01:56:07.678]  He lived as a bachelor.
[01:56:08.524 --> 01:56:15.189]  He had made no reference in any of the newspapers to having any child or wife in Hawaii.
[01:56:15.189 --> 01:56:27.397]  Well, it's now come out of U.S., what, just a few weeks ago, big mainstream newspapers and magazines, I'll know you can source them, I just read them a few weeks ago, that he got kicked out of the big U.S.
[01:56:27.397 --> 01:56:33.120]  university he was attending because they said it looks like he has multiple wives, women that aren't his wives.
[01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:34.581]  He's like a playboy.
[01:56:34.581 --> 01:56:38.204]  At Harvard, this is in the immigration and naturalization file,
[01:56:38.804 --> 01:56:39.844]  Barack Obama Sr.
[01:56:39.844 --> 01:56:41.625]  at Harvard.
[01:56:41.625 --> 01:56:43.865]  There was a Kenyan exchange student in Boston.
[01:56:43.865 --> 01:56:47.266]  Barack Obama got her pregnant, too.
[01:56:47.266 --> 01:56:49.646]  And he had to fly her to London to get an abortion.
[01:56:49.646 --> 01:56:53.167]  This is in the Immigration and Naturalization Service file.
[01:56:53.167 --> 01:57:02.429]  Harvard and the INS concluded that his marriage to Ann Dunham was a sham marriage just done in order to extend his stay in the United States.
[01:57:02.429 --> 01:57:06.910]  They had a wife and a child that he never married and never lived with.
[01:57:07.953 --> 01:57:14.017]  At Harvard, decided just to cut off his money because they couldn't put a stop to his philandering.
[01:57:14.017 --> 01:57:15.377]  And by the way, this is all public.
[01:57:15.377 --> 01:57:16.438]  I mean, this is... It's all public information.
[01:57:16.438 --> 01:57:19.820]  This comes out of the INS file that's been recently released.
[01:57:19.820 --> 01:57:22.962]  Well, by the way, his dad doesn't even look like him to me.
[01:57:22.962 --> 01:57:34.188]  Well, I think with the story I've just told you about Bill Lederer's bar and Ann Dunham getting pregnant and deciding that, you know, her fairy dream would come true if Barack Obama Sr.
[01:57:34.188 --> 01:57:35.169]  would just marry her.
[01:57:35.749 --> 01:57:42.096]  And that's why Obama, Barry Sotero, has always been obsessed with being president because it was mommy's dream to be the president.
[01:57:42.096 --> 01:57:42.897]  It was mommy's dream!
[01:57:56.044 --> 01:57:59.146]  With Daddy, who didn't participate.
[01:57:59.146 --> 01:58:02.448]  Daddy looked at this woman and he said, look, I don't have any money.
[01:58:02.448 --> 01:58:04.389]  I'm, you know, I'm trying to get through.
[01:58:04.389 --> 01:58:09.312]  He entered, I got the whole record, he entered University of Hawaii as a junior.
[01:58:09.312 --> 01:58:12.314]  I know where he first lived in the YMCA building.
[01:58:12.314 --> 01:58:13.695]  He had no money.
[01:58:13.695 --> 01:58:18.979]  He very, he got on the Phi Beta Kappa list and the Dean's list while he was there.
[01:58:18.979 --> 01:58:20.960]  Three years, he had a master's degree.
[01:58:20.960 --> 01:58:23.421]  He didn't want to live with this crazy white woman, Ann Dunham.
[01:58:24.502 --> 01:58:29.667]  I was determined to tell him, you're the father of my child and I'll go to Africa to prove your family will accept me.
[01:58:29.667 --> 01:58:31.288]  Sure, so she doesn't even know.
[01:58:31.288 --> 01:58:32.369]  She didn't even know.
[01:58:32.369 --> 01:58:33.110]  Probably not.
[01:58:33.110 --> 01:58:34.091]  Tell you what, stay there.
[01:58:34.091 --> 01:58:35.692]  This is too important.
[01:58:35.692 --> 01:58:37.333]  And this is why they're so scared.
[01:58:37.333 --> 01:58:39.916]  We'll be right back in one minute with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:58:39.916 --> 01:58:42.898]  Incredible.

[01:59:04.480 --> 01:59:10.042]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[01:59:10.042 --> 01:59:13.684]  Not worried about them moving south.
[01:59:13.684 --> 01:59:17.226]  Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.

[01:59:54.239 --> 01:59:56.641]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.641 --> 01:59:59.403]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:06.041 --> 02:00:10.863]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.863 --> 02:00:12.464]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.464 --> 02:00:13.984]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.984 --> 02:00:18.186]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.186 --> 02:00:24.788]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.788 --> 02:00:30.090]  Look, to be clear, I gotta tell you, Dr. Corsi is always very careful about his claims.
[02:00:30.090 --> 02:00:32.251]  He's very meticulous.
[02:00:32.251 --> 02:00:33.472]  And just finishing the book,
[02:00:35.106 --> 02:01:01.624]  Last week, I knew some of the information in here, but the exhibits, the documentation, and knowing this book was finished months ago, so much of what he's now put in the book, it's as if they're trying to psychologically inoculate with the Boston papers and New York papers coming out and going, yeah, here's the State Department documents, here's Harvard kicking Barack Obama Sr.
[02:01:01.624 --> 02:01:04.826]  out for all these wives and fake marriages.
[02:01:06.027 --> 02:01:12.694]  All of what's now come out is vindicating what was already written in this book that was done months ago.
[02:01:12.694 --> 02:01:18.360]  And look, I've got detractors that lie about me all the time and I don't even respond because it's a joke.
[02:01:18.360 --> 02:01:26.388]  The way they're acting, his press conference, the body language, the fakeness of this new birth certificate, the fact that they said it never existed.
[02:01:27.189 --> 02:01:29.851]  Uh, and that the, and that the last one was real.
[02:01:29.851 --> 02:01:32.352]  The governor saying, I went to look, it's not there.
[02:01:32.352 --> 02:01:47.519]  Uh, then it appearing, uh, and now Corsi wouldn't come out and say he's hot on the trail and privately, you know, tell me they even basically know who forged it, uh, if they didn't have, uh, the meat and potatoes on this.
[02:01:47.519 --> 02:01:52.082]  Dr. Corsi, uh, getting back to this Esquire, I, I'm not a litigious person.
[02:01:52.873 --> 02:02:16.389]  But if I had spent millions of dollars to print up hundreds of thousands of books, and the hundred thousand or so to fly you all over the world, and page you, if I was Joseph Farah, I mean this was, for those that don't know how the book publishing business works and things, I mean this was clearly designed, what Esquire did, saying it was discredited, Farah was recalling it, that was meant to cause a run on the book
[02:02:16.949 --> 02:02:23.212]  People demanding money back, so people that are selling it in bookstores get scared and pull it off shelves, correct?
[02:02:23.212 --> 02:02:23.812]  That's correct.
[02:02:23.812 --> 02:02:26.654]  Their whole idea was trying to destroy the marketing.
[02:02:26.654 --> 02:02:32.576]  Get the book while it's just getting out there and tell people, you know, it's misinformation.
[02:02:32.576 --> 02:02:34.457]  Classic misinformation campaign.
[02:02:34.457 --> 02:02:36.918]  Intelligence agents do it all the time.
[02:02:36.918 --> 02:02:39.299]  The book has been always on sale.
[02:02:39.299 --> 02:02:40.420]  It was never pulled.
[02:02:41.016 --> 02:02:50.579]  We wanted it to be called Where's the Birth Certificate because we were trying to induce Barack Obama to get so scared he'd release the document he released.
[02:02:50.579 --> 02:02:52.240]  I knew it had to be false.
[02:02:52.240 --> 02:02:55.281]  I know Barack Obama was not born in Hawaii.
[02:02:55.281 --> 02:02:59.342]  Kapi'olani does not have the records of his mother and they can't, I don't think, fake them.
[02:02:59.659 --> 02:03:07.284]  By the way, the Kenyan security force, they wouldn't put you on house arrest when you went to Kenya if there wasn't something to hide.
[02:03:07.284 --> 02:03:10.826]  Well, you know, and I have the documents.
[02:03:10.826 --> 02:03:11.787]  I've begun to print them.
[02:03:11.787 --> 02:03:13.628]  I'm going to do a lot more next week.
[02:03:13.628 --> 02:03:18.631]  Making it very clear, the Kenyan government and the intelligence services did a deep search
[02:03:19.469 --> 02:03:21.290]  A massive amount of searching.
[02:03:21.290 --> 02:03:22.851]  Going for Obama's birth record.
[02:03:22.851 --> 02:03:23.852]  They believe they were there.
[02:03:23.852 --> 02:03:26.934]  The grandmother's been saying for years.
[02:03:26.934 --> 02:03:31.357]  The grandmother may have told Obama when he first came to Africa, I was there when you were born.
[02:03:31.357 --> 02:03:41.985]  Why does Michelle Obama in multiple speeches, we can play right now for folks, what three, four years ago, give speeches saying we went back to Kenya, his home country, his homeland?
[02:03:41.985 --> 02:03:43.386]  Well, I document in the book
[02:03:43.926 --> 02:03:51.930]  Barack Obama, before he was running for president, was happy to say, and have people write and print, that he was born in Kenya.
[02:03:51.930 --> 02:03:58.893]  And I'm quite confident, psychologically, subconsciously, it comes out for Michelle, because he was born in Kenya.
[02:03:58.893 --> 02:03:59.854]  And the family knows it.
[02:04:00.655 --> 02:04:02.416]  The Kenyan government knows it.
[02:04:02.416 --> 02:04:14.999]  They can't find the records because the records were criminally destroyed, but they found the pattern of destruction of birth records in Kenya that documents that Barack Obama's records were intentionally gotten rid of.
[02:04:14.999 --> 02:04:21.361]  And the Kenyan government says, they say there's 47 instances of specifics of where birth records have been tampered.
[02:04:21.361 --> 02:04:28.883]  They said this is a pattern to destroy Barack Obama's birth records and to alter the birth records around him so as to disguise the past.
[02:04:29.923 --> 02:04:30.263]  I don't know.
[02:04:50.125 --> 02:04:54.709]  Bottom line, I'm going to ask them on the other side, is this Obama's Nixon moment?
[02:04:54.709 --> 02:04:58.571]  Is this the beginning of a Watergate-type meltdown?
[02:04:58.571 --> 02:05:01.393]  Because there's no doubt they're running scared from this.
[02:05:01.393 --> 02:05:04.376]  It could never happen in America, but it's happening right now.
[02:05:04.376 --> 02:05:07.718]  Gas prices are exploding past the incomes of millions of families.
[02:05:07.998 --> 02:05:14.600]  As gas prices and crop failures push high food costs, you can still get the best food on the planet from eFoodsDirect.com.

[02:06:25.455 --> 02:06:31.419]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.

[02:08:01.737 --> 02:08:06.862]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:06.862 --> 02:08:09.144]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:18.385 --> 02:08:19.386]  Well, very exciting.
[02:08:19.386 --> 02:08:28.499]  Dr. Jerome Corsi is going to be working with us putting out these super viral YouTube news presentations as this news and information breaks.
[02:08:28.499 --> 02:08:30.461]  He just joined us last hour.
[02:08:30.461 --> 02:08:32.764]  They believe they know who the forger is.
[02:08:35.046 --> 02:08:39.448]  The document itself is a manifest unprofessional fraud at every level.
[02:08:39.448 --> 02:08:50.655]  They're just basically knowing if they release it, once the mainstream dinosaur media commits to it, they will then have a stake in not being discredited and will then always defend the lie.
[02:08:50.655 --> 02:09:00.320]  Also, he's breaking here that early next week at WorldNetDaily.com, WMD.com, they will be releasing documents from the Kenyan government
[02:09:00.780 --> 02:09:08.307]  That there's been criminal tampering in the birth records of the hospital where the evidence shows Barack Obama was born.
[02:09:08.307 --> 02:09:11.790]  Dr. Corsi would not be going this far if he didn't have that information.
[02:09:11.790 --> 02:09:15.133]  Also, it's now been confirmed what's in the book written months and months and months ago.
[02:09:16.814 --> 02:09:30.637]  By major newspapers in the US that the State Department was asked by Harvard to take the visa The education visa away from Barack Obama senior because he had all these other women pregnant and fake marriages You can just look at Obama folks.
[02:09:30.637 --> 02:09:34.558]  It's not his dad, but Clearly the fact is they were probably not married.
[02:09:34.558 --> 02:09:39.199]  So you've got the bastard news Coming out not that that's necessarily a bad thing.
[02:09:39.199 --> 02:09:44.300]  The point is, you know life's a good thing period It's just that they've got something to cover up here
[02:09:45.020 --> 02:09:45.200]  I don't
[02:10:04.934 --> 02:10:14.959]  And are they fleeing forward, and now that's why they're running on the birth certificate, being real, this whole Made in America, this fundraising.
[02:10:14.959 --> 02:10:18.461]  After three years of ignoring this, is this their waterloo?
[02:10:18.461 --> 02:10:20.062]  Yes, this is the beginning of the end.
[02:10:20.062 --> 02:10:32.128]  The Obama administration knows if the American people read what's in this book, where's the birth certificate, and understand that studies the exhibit, the Obama administration cannot survive.
[02:10:33.766 --> 02:10:37.828]  The other thing, if people don't understand, I wanted the title to be, where's the birth certificate?
[02:10:37.828 --> 02:10:40.790]  Joseph Farren said, well they could release the birth certificate.
[02:10:40.790 --> 02:10:42.831]  I said, if they do, it'll be fake.
[02:10:42.831 --> 02:10:54.458]  But that's what we want them to do, because then Obama will be committed, Obama will have to own that document, and the minute we can prove that that document is fraudulent, the Obama administration crashes.
[02:10:55.839 --> 02:10:59.080]  Why would they bet everything on such a fraud?
[02:10:59.080 --> 02:11:04.941]  The CIA, the State Department, they're masters at putting out near-perfect forgeries.
[02:11:04.941 --> 02:11:06.641]  It was the only thing they could think to do.
[02:11:06.641 --> 02:11:08.722]  They had to forge it within the group.
[02:11:08.722 --> 02:11:10.622]  They couldn't go outside the group.
[02:11:10.622 --> 02:11:11.482]  They picked the best.
[02:11:11.482 --> 02:11:13.242]  It wasn't that good.
[02:11:13.242 --> 02:11:14.543]  They were stuck with it.
[02:11:14.543 --> 02:11:19.444]  And they used this strategy, they decided to go with this strategy to try to preempt the book.
[02:11:19.444 --> 02:11:21.524]  Remember, they can't stand the publication of this book.
[02:11:22.285 --> 02:11:29.430]  Once the American people read where's the birth certificate, they've got enough information to know that Barack Obama is not eligible to be president.
[02:11:29.430 --> 02:11:31.591]  He's not even who he says he is.
[02:11:31.591 --> 02:11:34.273]  That's why all these documents are being hidden.
[02:11:34.273 --> 02:11:42.017]  And the administration can't stand that anybody will read it until they say, let's rush together, let's put the birth certificate out.
[02:11:42.017 --> 02:11:48.041]  The only thing they have left to save themselves, that we can count on the mainstream media, they'll say the story's dead.
[02:11:48.041 --> 02:11:50.903]  All the while I'm saying, okay, look, I'm going to take a hit.
[02:11:51.443 --> 02:12:05.251]  For a while it's going to look like I'm not credible, but when we prove the birth certificate of fraud, when we prove there's no patient records for Anne Donovan Capulani, then the administration crashes and they crash criminally.
[02:12:05.251 --> 02:12:08.233]  I suffer a little bit of a hit for a while where they make fun of me.
[02:12:08.233 --> 02:12:12.395]  In the end, the vindication with the truth is what I'm after.
[02:12:12.395 --> 02:12:17.018]  The truth is, Barack Obama was not born in Hawaii.
[02:12:17.638 --> 02:12:20.380]  The proof is he's born in Kenya.
[02:12:20.380 --> 02:12:39.251]  The proof is he may not be who he says he is, may not even know, but want to reveal his true birth circumstances, and he was a dual citizen which independently disqualified him at birth from his father, if that was his father, in Kenya, and in Indonesia from his stepfather when he became Beri Sotoro Sorbaka.
[02:12:41.314 --> 02:12:45.938]  And you also dropped the bombshell that Donald Trump has contacted you.
[02:12:45.938 --> 02:12:47.539]  He got an advance copy of the book.
[02:12:47.539 --> 02:12:53.104]  Donald Trump called me, pumped me for information, got us to send him an advance copy of the book.
[02:12:53.104 --> 02:12:56.887]  You know, I had no assurance that that wasn't going right to the White House.
[02:12:56.887 --> 02:12:58.849]  Mike Cohen calling me, talking to me.
[02:12:58.849 --> 02:13:00.890]  They're talking to Charlie Schumer.
[02:13:00.890 --> 02:13:03.853]  Look, the whole deal was a setup because with Trump,
[02:13:05.698 --> 02:13:15.485]  Immediately, Obama says, look, you come and make the issue very big, then I'll release the birth certificate, you'll be a hero, you got the birth, and then just drop the issue.
[02:13:15.485 --> 02:13:19.668]  Then the bin Laden, this whole thing, you can see the scripting.
[02:13:19.668 --> 02:13:29.876]  And if Trump were truly in this, and I told Trump, he called me up, I said, Trump, you get back into this and say that you want verification of these documents.
[02:13:29.876 --> 02:13:34.279]  You want to see the original, best evidence, the original paper document, not this.
[02:13:34.913 --> 02:13:38.755]  And then we've got NBC that we know got massive bailout money.
[02:13:38.755 --> 02:13:39.635]  From GE.
[02:13:39.635 --> 02:13:42.476]  With GE, you know, virtually having an office in the White House.
[02:14:03.314 --> 02:14:08.036]  Breathing heavily about casinos going to be built in Chicago and maybe some tall buildings.
[02:14:08.036 --> 02:14:11.857]  I'm just waiting for Trump to show up competing for those contracts.
[02:14:11.857 --> 02:14:15.458]  I'll be there investigating it.
[02:14:15.458 --> 02:14:17.899]  I don't like being played for a chump either.
[02:14:17.899 --> 02:14:28.662]  I gave Trump information, trusting him, expecting him to stay in this battle and not to have me walk out on the plank while he sits at the boat because I got my $60 billion from GE.
[02:14:28.662 --> 02:14:30.603]  I don't care about Obama's birth records anymore.
[02:14:30.823 --> 02:14:35.104]  Well, in closing, you see the... I want to go back to this, Esquire, for folks that haven't read it.
[02:14:35.104 --> 02:14:42.526]  It was written clearly, you know, as a news piece to try to say that you guys had disavowed your own book.
[02:14:42.526 --> 02:14:44.867]  Right, which we did not.
[02:14:44.867 --> 02:14:56.691]  And I'm not a litigious person, but I think Farah has an absolute... Farah's gonna... In today's WND Top Skyline headline, Farah says, help me to own Esquire.
[02:14:56.691 --> 02:14:57.811]  He's suing Esquire.
[02:14:59.189 --> 02:14:59.469]  We will.
[02:14:59.469 --> 02:14:59.870]  Correct.
[02:14:59.870 --> 02:15:00.850]  I'm attacked every day.
[02:15:17.485 --> 02:15:24.268]  And so we know we're on the list, and they say we're going to infiltrate, we're going to destroy, we're going to use... And go after the sponsors.
[02:15:24.268 --> 02:15:26.129]  We're going to use spies!
[02:15:26.129 --> 02:15:33.652]  They're targeting now companies like Orbit, they're saying if you advertise with Fox, we're going to run a national campaign.
[02:15:33.652 --> 02:15:39.774]  This is blackmail, this should be criminal what Media Matters is doing, targeting out
[02:15:40.467 --> 02:15:43.610]  Yeah, but worse than that, in those memos that Politico got...
[02:15:56.360 --> 02:16:01.543]  Well, yes, but in there they say we'll infiltrate into their companies with spies.
[02:16:01.543 --> 02:16:03.024]  Now, that's espionage.
[02:16:03.024 --> 02:16:04.345]  Well, that's espionage.
[02:16:04.345 --> 02:16:06.446]  They're doing espionage, extortion.
[02:16:06.446 --> 02:16:11.230]  You know, these are bug tactics capable of Chicago.
[02:16:11.230 --> 02:16:15.352]  And if that's what Soros wants to do, funding media matters, so be it.
[02:16:15.352 --> 02:16:16.573]  But I think it's criminal.
[02:16:16.573 --> 02:16:17.954]  I think it's a RICO violation.
[02:16:19.127 --> 02:16:23.709]  Well, there's infiltrating and getting your people hired into companies to, quote, destroy them?
[02:16:23.709 --> 02:16:26.891]  That's... It's absolutely beyond the pale.
[02:16:26.891 --> 02:16:39.117]  What they tried to do, you know, with getting us with this magazine, going out and saying the book had been pulled from the shelves, well, that's completely untrue.
[02:16:40.239 --> 02:16:45.882]  You know, you've got Esquire out there on the limb, trying to destroy our market.
[02:16:45.882 --> 02:16:50.785]  We spent the whole day, people wanting, you know, we shouldn't go buy the book, it's gone.
[02:16:50.785 --> 02:16:56.909]  All that misinformation, classic misinformation techniques from intelligence agencies.
[02:16:56.909 --> 02:17:03.813]  If that's what Esquire wants to do, then let them explain in court how they had an intention to destroy the book and what damages that causes.
[02:17:04.878 --> 02:17:09.222]  Well, bottom line, it's meant to cause people to run back to the store saying, I want my money back.
[02:17:09.222 --> 02:17:14.386]  Then all the big booksellers, Barnes and Nobles, panics and pulls it off shelves.
[02:17:14.386 --> 02:17:20.611]  Have you ever seen an attempt by the administration, by someone in the White House, to destroy a book?
[02:17:21.408 --> 02:17:27.230]  In the history of book publishing, I don't remember any president going after a book like this.
[02:17:27.230 --> 02:17:31.072]  Nixon actually went after some authors and people, and you saw what happened to him.
[02:17:31.072 --> 02:17:33.993]  This shows that they are running scared.
[02:17:33.993 --> 02:17:35.454]  They're on their last legs.
[02:17:35.454 --> 02:17:36.714]  They're gasping.
[02:17:36.714 --> 02:17:37.855]  They're desperate.
[02:17:37.855 --> 02:17:40.876]  They're using fraudulent methods.
[02:17:40.876 --> 02:17:45.638]  They're using strong-arm tactics.
[02:17:45.638 --> 02:17:46.558]  And I'm just an author.
[02:17:47.205 --> 02:17:48.929]  They want to vilify me.
[02:17:48.929 --> 02:17:51.315]  If that's what they have to do to stay in the White House, so be it.
[02:17:51.315 --> 02:17:53.541]  I'll tolerate that for a while.
[02:17:53.541 --> 02:17:56.749]  The final analysis, if that document's fraudulent...
[02:17:57.702 --> 02:18:05.428]  Then we're vindicated and the White House is going to have to explain to criminal court why a criminal document was brought out.
[02:18:05.428 --> 02:18:09.752]  And Obama will have to explain to the American people why he resorted to crime to stay in office.
[02:18:09.752 --> 02:18:13.294]  Alright, we've only got about a minute and a half left and we're coming back for the rest of the hour on Economic News.
[02:18:13.294 --> 02:18:16.357]  Bob Chapman, formerly with Intelligence, U.S.
[02:18:16.357 --> 02:18:18.238]  government, syndicated.
[02:18:18.238 --> 02:18:20.400]  I know Bob well and I highly admire Bob.
[02:18:20.600 --> 02:18:22.741]  Let's bring Bob up just for a quick question.
[02:18:22.741 --> 02:18:25.943]  Final question for Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[02:18:25.943 --> 02:18:31.246]  Listening to this, Bob, do you have any questions or comments for Dr. Corsi?
[02:18:31.246 --> 02:18:36.468]  Well, I love his work and I am absolutely thrilled that he's done it.
[02:18:36.468 --> 02:18:40.190]  And I think there's a good chance he can take them down with it.
[02:18:40.190 --> 02:18:43.432]  And so everybody who's listening should be proud of Jerome Corsi.
[02:18:44.651 --> 02:18:46.959]  Well, I mean, I want to endorse Bob's newsletter.
[02:18:46.959 --> 02:18:48.423]  I've been reading it for years.
[02:18:48.423 --> 02:18:51.312]  It's the best, most insightful newsletter in the business.
[02:18:51.312 --> 02:18:52.074]  I rely on it.
[02:18:52.386 --> 02:19:00.149]  Well, there's no doubt, Dr. Corsi, you hit the barbed wire with this, and you're always a very careful person, and I've read the book.
[02:19:00.149 --> 02:19:07.492]  There's definitely a cover-up going on here, and that itself, in law, is a crime, covering up a crime.
[02:19:07.492 --> 02:19:11.774]  They're desperate, something's going on, and they put out this shoddy fake.
[02:19:11.774 --> 02:19:13.975]  There's no doubt about that.
[02:19:13.975 --> 02:19:17.777]  And so, are they trying to cover up he's a bastard?
[02:19:17.777 --> 02:19:19.998]  Now, that's what Wayne Madsen has said.
[02:19:21.379 --> 02:19:24.303]  I don't think it's necessarily that they care that he's a bastard.
[02:19:24.303 --> 02:19:36.518]  What they're covering up is that the mother, desperate to find Obama and induce him to be the father, took on her own a trip to Africa to try to convince the family she should be the princess.
[02:19:36.518 --> 02:19:37.299]  That's the story.
[02:19:37.739 --> 02:19:39.781]  Yeah, because he was in line to get into politics.
[02:19:39.781 --> 02:19:40.781]  Barack Obama Sr.
[02:19:40.781 --> 02:19:43.283]  couldn't care less, and the family couldn't care less.
[02:19:43.283 --> 02:19:46.986]  They took this crazy girl over to the Boston Hospital and let her have her baby.
[02:19:46.986 --> 02:19:48.066]  They sent her home.
[02:19:48.066 --> 02:19:51.369]  That's her missing six months, and she goes to Seattle.
[02:19:51.369 --> 02:19:53.210]  All right, Dr. Corsi, thank you so much.
[02:19:53.210 --> 02:19:54.511]  Let me say bye to you during the break.

[02:22:03.484 --> 02:22:05.805]  Alex Jones here with key information.
[02:22:05.805 --> 02:22:06.386]  The U.S.
[02:22:06.386 --> 02:22:13.650]  government is a Ponzi scheme that relies on the Treasury continuously selling large amounts of government bonds to foreign central banks.
[02:22:13.650 --> 02:22:16.351]  With Japan about to become a seller of U.S.
[02:22:16.351 --> 02:22:19.693]  bonds in order to rebuild its own nation, and the U.S.
[02:22:19.693 --> 02:22:26.337]  antagonizing China by calling them currency manipulators, the Federal Reserve, which is already buying about 70% of U.S.
[02:22:26.337 --> 02:22:28.999]  Treasuries, will soon be the only buyer left of U.S.
[02:22:28.999 --> 02:22:29.439]  Treasuries.
[02:22:29.839 --> 02:22:33.360]  Our friends at the National Inflation Association believe that the U.S.
[02:22:33.360 --> 02:22:39.301]  dollar will soon become worthless and Americans will see the purchasing power of their incomes and savings destroyed.
[02:22:39.301 --> 02:22:47.763]  I strongly urge my fellow Americans to sign up for the free NIA newsletter at www.inflation.us.
[02:22:47.763 --> 02:22:57.105]  If you are sick and tired of the economic propaganda in the mainstream media, sign up for free at inflation.us to learn the economic truth that the mainstream media ignores.
[02:23:00.385 --> 02:23:03.087]  Food prices are spiraling out of control.
[02:23:03.087 --> 02:23:09.472]  In order to survive, you will soon need to produce some or all of your own food in your backyard or small farm.
[02:23:09.472 --> 02:23:18.600]  Many years ago, sought-after radio guest Marjorie Wildcraft and her family began working to find the easiest ways to grow food for the crisis we are now facing.
[02:23:18.600 --> 02:23:22.603]  Marjorie created a video that is the fastest way to learn how to grow food.
[02:23:22.603 --> 02:23:28.848]  You'll learn the most efficient gardening methods, myths and truths of orchards and edible landscaping, effective predator protection
[02:23:29.148 --> 02:23:29.789]  I think so.
[02:24:01.716 --> 02:24:02.397]  We're good.
[02:24:07.705 --> 02:24:08.906]  Bob Chapman's our guest.
[02:24:08.906 --> 02:24:13.148]  I want to get into the economy, a bunch of important police state news.
[02:24:13.148 --> 02:24:21.152]  Bob's inside Scoop because he has so many connections on the Dominique Strauss-Kahn situation.
[02:24:21.152 --> 02:24:32.878]  But finishing up with the birth certificate, Bob, you know, I mean, out of hundreds of broadcasts I do a year, every year I do five, six, seven shows on the birther issue and say, I don't know, but looks like they're covering something up.
[02:24:32.878 --> 02:24:36.360]  But now, the way they put out this shoddy certificate,
[02:24:37.443 --> 02:24:40.805]  The way they ran dirty tricks against WorldNetDaily and Corsi.
[02:24:40.805 --> 02:24:43.626]  I mean, there's no doubt that thing's fake.
[02:24:43.626 --> 02:24:48.168]  There's no doubt they said the last one was the long form and nothing else existed.
[02:24:48.168 --> 02:24:51.190]  There's no doubt Governor Abercrombie said he went and looked and couldn't find it.
[02:24:51.190 --> 02:24:53.171]  And then suddenly it's there.
[02:24:53.171 --> 02:24:55.192]  I mean, what on earth is going on?
[02:24:56.909 --> 02:24:58.891]  Well, I'm trying to cover up.
[02:24:58.891 --> 02:25:05.076]  You know, this is Brzezinski and Soros who put this guy in the position that he's in.
[02:25:05.076 --> 02:25:12.603]  They figured they could bulldoze the American people into believing that he was what they say he is.
[02:25:12.603 --> 02:25:18.148]  And now Jerome has written a book that tells you that isn't the case.
[02:25:18.148 --> 02:25:21.811]  And this is what investigative journalism is all about.
[02:25:21.811 --> 02:25:23.693]  And the quality of telling the truth.
[02:25:24.453 --> 02:25:26.455]  And it's going to be crippling.
[02:25:26.455 --> 02:25:28.616]  They should have thought of all this.
[02:25:28.616 --> 02:25:43.425]  And now you get the attack coming forward by Media Matters, which is the service's company or whatever they call it.
[02:25:43.425 --> 02:25:52.311]  And I also went to your staff here a couple of weeks ago that Media Matters was attacking G. Edward Griffith too.
[02:25:53.277 --> 02:26:02.164]  Well, when they get up there and say that it's crazy to question government and that we just need to believe what we're told, everybody knows government's constantly caught lying.
[02:26:18.007 --> 02:26:21.610]  And then, why do you think it's such a bad forgery?
[02:26:21.610 --> 02:26:26.693]  Because, I mean, the whole thing's a joke!
[02:26:26.693 --> 02:26:27.674]  Well, you're right.
[02:26:27.674 --> 02:26:35.559]  And I mulled that over when I was first informed of its quality, not being a professional in that area.
[02:26:35.559 --> 02:26:39.302]  And, um, either one or two things happened in Jerome Game.
[02:26:39.302 --> 02:26:41.743]  One of them, they had to rush to get this thing done.
[02:26:41.743 --> 02:26:43.465]  Had to be done within their own circle.
[02:26:44.301 --> 02:26:47.645]  And they pick what they thought was the best person to do it.
[02:26:47.645 --> 02:26:57.815]  And as you pointed out, had they gone to the FBI or the CIA, particularly the CIA, they could have made them a wonderful forgery.
[02:26:57.815 --> 02:26:59.877]  But they didn't do that.
[02:26:59.877 --> 02:27:00.758]  I just think they're dumb.
[02:27:04.278 --> 02:27:14.860]  For those that don't know, the British and US Forgery Departments of the Intelligence Services keep every known typewriter used, copies of old paper.
[02:27:16.030 --> 02:27:17.131]  It's a good way to put it.
[02:27:46.960 --> 02:27:48.640]  Well, whoever.
[02:27:48.640 --> 02:27:57.383]  I think the point is, Jerome is going to, in finality, prove that the President of the United States is not who he says he is.
[02:27:57.383 --> 02:28:00.924]  He's not an American citizen, and so on and so forth.
[02:28:00.924 --> 02:28:04.985]  And that could take him down from office.
[02:28:07.202 --> 02:28:09.803]  Then we get Joe Biden, if you can believe that.
[02:28:09.803 --> 02:28:18.024]  But that's the way the changes of power are in the Western world and have been for some time.
[02:28:18.024 --> 02:28:24.685]  And I expect that there'll be, you know, all sorts of things in the media.
[02:28:24.685 --> 02:28:28.686]  The media, of course, is committed, so they have to defend him.
[02:28:28.686 --> 02:28:33.007]  But in the final analysis, he's going to be out of office, I think.
[02:28:34.275 --> 02:28:34.975]  Well, that's right.
[02:28:34.975 --> 02:28:46.523]  Once the media unquestioningly, two and a half years ago, bought the other certificate as the total proof and the end all be all, and then once they committed to this new lie, they don't have a choice.
[02:28:46.523 --> 02:28:51.987]  They're going to continue digging the hole deeper for themselves.
[02:28:51.987 --> 02:28:53.568]  That's right.
[02:28:53.568 --> 02:28:59.852]  The old adage I learned when I was a little boy, you tell a lie, you got to tell 20 more to make up for it.
[02:28:59.852 --> 02:29:00.933]  It's hardly worth it.
[02:29:00.933 --> 02:29:02.794]  And that's why my whole life,
[02:29:03.860 --> 02:29:10.405]  I've tried to tell the truth each and every time because I don't want that burden of having to worry about the lies I gotta tell.
[02:29:10.405 --> 02:29:11.206]  Well, exactly.
[02:29:11.206 --> 02:29:16.510]  That's what's so great about doing the research, telling the truth, is that you don't have to remember anything.
[02:29:16.510 --> 02:29:19.172]  I mean, you're just going with what the research is and it's right there.
[02:29:19.172 --> 02:29:22.715]  You're not having to remember what you said before about this or that.
[02:29:22.715 --> 02:29:25.958]  That's why so many of these politicians have got to read off teleprompters.
[02:29:25.958 --> 02:29:32.123]  It's because they're just complete liars and they've got to have experts that go over it and make sure the lies have continuity.
[02:29:32.123 --> 02:29:32.663]  I want to
[02:29:33.931 --> 02:29:36.252]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:36.252 --> 02:29:37.172]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.445 --> 02:30:05.988]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:30:05.988 --> 02:30:06.908]  Number 1.
[02:30:06.908 --> 02:30:10.331]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:10.331 --> 02:30:11.191]  Number 2.
[02:30:11.191 --> 02:30:16.074]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:30:16.074 --> 02:30:16.835]  It's true.
[02:30:16.835 --> 02:30:21.698]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:30:21.698 --> 02:30:22.518]  Number 3.
[02:30:22.518 --> 02:30:26.101]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:30:26.101 --> 02:30:29.803]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:30.003 --> 02:30:30.803]  Number 4.
[02:30:30.803 --> 02:30:33.564]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:30:33.564 --> 02:30:37.246]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:30:37.246 --> 02:30:38.026]  Number 5.
[02:30:38.026 --> 02:30:42.188]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:30:42.188 --> 02:30:47.230]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:30:47.230 --> 02:30:51.411]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[02:32:01.220 --> 02:32:02.361]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:32:02.361 --> 02:32:09.289]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:32:09.289 --> 02:32:11.852]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:32:11.852 --> 02:32:17.237]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:32:17.237 --> 02:32:20.281]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:32:20.281 --> 02:32:22.343]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:32:22.583 --> 02:32:28.828]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:32:28.828 --> 02:32:32.210]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:32:32.210 --> 02:32:37.994]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:32:37.994 --> 02:32:39.635]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:32:39.635 --> 02:32:40.936]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:32:40.936 --> 02:32:43.598]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:32:43.598 --> 02:32:47.841]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:32:47.841 --> 02:32:49.863]  You can find the video at www.
[02:32:50.623 --> 02:32:52.443]  End of America 3.com.
[02:32:52.443 --> 02:32:55.024]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[02:33:06.126 --> 02:33:12.147]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:33:12.147 --> 02:33:14.708]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:18.865 --> 02:33:21.068]  We're going right back to Bob Chapman in a moment.
[02:33:21.068 --> 02:33:25.993]  We're carrying a new animated DVD film that is Disney quality.
[02:33:25.993 --> 02:33:27.335]  It's just incredible.
[02:33:27.335 --> 02:33:28.896]  The American Dream.
[02:33:28.896 --> 02:33:33.321]  And it goes over the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, how the Federal Reserve operates.
[02:33:33.321 --> 02:33:36.145]  This is the film to show children, but also adults.
[02:33:37.526 --> 02:33:46.312]  I mean, it is very entertaining, but really illustrates the tyranny of these people, and I am just amazed at the work that these filmmakers have done.
[02:33:46.312 --> 02:33:48.533]  It's available at InfoWars.com.
[02:33:48.533 --> 02:34:01.542]  Also, the new Dan Dix film, proving that there is a global standardized program of setting up police states and nations, and they illustrate police caught in provocateur actions in the new film, End of the Fire, available at InfoWars.com.
[02:34:01.542 --> 02:34:05.225]  Of course, Jason Burmess's excellent film, The New World Order Divined,
[02:34:05.885 --> 02:34:11.028]  Again, a new order to find, Invisible Empire, writes down their total master plan.
[02:34:11.028 --> 02:34:17.831]  That's all available at InfoWars.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139 and it is your purchase of the books, the videos.
[02:34:21.533 --> 02:34:21.913]  We're good to go.
[02:34:37.248 --> 02:34:40.790]  And become a sponsor of all the great new affiliates that we're getting.
[02:34:40.790 --> 02:34:42.631]  On average, three new affiliates a week.
[02:34:42.631 --> 02:34:53.916]  It is very important with George Soros and the White House and all these calls, Bill Clinton coming out saying they want a Ministry of Truth to shut down alternative media, the Fairness Doctrine.
[02:34:53.916 --> 02:35:05.702]  It is more important than ever to support not just this show, this broadcast, but all alternative media and the affiliates that bring you this information.
[02:35:06.641 --> 02:35:10.924]  Speaking of sponsors, I want to tell you about the National Inflation Association.
[02:35:10.924 --> 02:35:16.927]  For two-thirds of Americans getting ready to retire, Social Security will be more than 50% of their income.
[02:35:16.927 --> 02:35:20.589]  And for 22% of upcoming retirees, Social Security will be their only income.
[02:35:20.589 --> 02:35:26.793]  With massive inflation wipes out the purchasing power of American Social Security payments, retirement in America will become a thing of the past.
[02:35:27.273 --> 02:35:37.681]  We will see millions of retired senior citizens re-enter the workforce, combined with the millions of government workers who will soon need to find new jobs when the dollar becomes worthless and the government goes bust.
[02:35:37.681 --> 02:35:41.944]  It will be nearly impossible for upcoming college graduates to find a job in the U.S.
[02:35:41.944 --> 02:35:47.768]  Go to inflation.us and click on the Videos tab to see this breakthrough film now, The College Conspiracy.
[02:35:47.768 --> 02:35:51.111]  Again, that's inflation.us to watch the film today.
[02:35:51.111 --> 02:35:52.592]  And next week, we're going to have it in high def.
[02:35:53.092 --> 02:35:55.033]  It's an amazing film up on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:35:55.033 --> 02:35:57.775]  They've also told us we can post it there.
[02:35:57.775 --> 02:36:00.417]  Okay, going back now to Bob Chapman.
[02:36:00.417 --> 02:36:04.079]  Bob, I've got all this economic news.
[02:36:04.079 --> 02:36:06.181]  China is now the top gold bug.
[02:36:06.181 --> 02:36:08.102]  Financial Times is reporting.
[02:36:08.102 --> 02:36:10.043]  The Wall Street Journal is also reporting.
[02:36:10.043 --> 02:36:12.705]  Mexico buying massive amounts.
[02:36:12.705 --> 02:36:16.707]  Meanwhile, the system with papers trying to suppress it.
[02:36:16.707 --> 02:36:18.769]  We've got the currency wars accelerating.
[02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:28.947]  Bloomberg's reporting they have a HBO special coming out that literally worships Henry Paulson as our savior headline.
[02:36:28.947 --> 02:36:36.373]  Paulson cast as stoic savior in HBO, big, a Wall Street saga.
[02:36:36.373 --> 02:36:38.734]  I mean, this is just incredible.
[02:36:38.734 --> 02:36:43.978]  We've got China continuing to dump its purchases of Treasury notes.
[02:36:43.978 --> 02:36:45.920]  What's happening in the economy right now?
[02:36:47.898 --> 02:37:01.902]  Well, first of all, people think that by the end of June, and these are usually people who are professionals, that what is called QE3, QE2, is going to terminate.
[02:37:01.902 --> 02:37:07.324]  And the bottom line, very simply, is they terminate, the economy totally collapses.
[02:37:07.324 --> 02:37:10.485]  So they have to keep it up, and they will do it under another name.
[02:37:10.485 --> 02:37:12.065]  They'll dream something up.
[02:37:12.065 --> 02:37:14.486]  They've got people working 24-7 doing just such things.
[02:37:16.562 --> 02:37:18.143]  And so it's going to continue.
[02:37:18.143 --> 02:37:20.424]  That is what the stock market's telling you.
[02:37:20.424 --> 02:37:24.926]  And that's why in the Dow it moved from $10,800 to $12,800.
[02:37:24.926 --> 02:37:29.828]  They're discounting the news ahead of time.
[02:37:29.828 --> 02:37:34.790]  And the market normally does that because the insiders know what's going on.
[02:37:34.790 --> 02:37:35.690]  Who are they?
[02:37:35.690 --> 02:37:41.553]  JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, and on and on.
[02:37:41.553 --> 02:37:44.234]  So they know what's going on because they create the news.
[02:37:45.054 --> 02:37:50.639]  They don't get inside information, they make inside information.
[02:37:50.639 --> 02:37:55.924]  And so that's why you've seen what you've seen in the market defying reality.
[02:37:55.924 --> 02:38:07.354]  And I think probably once it becomes known that QE3 is in process, then the market will probably start to come up because all the good news will be out.
[02:38:07.354 --> 02:38:11.077]  Continued spending of money and not a collapse in the economy.
[02:38:12.109 --> 02:38:12.369]  I think?
[02:38:28.030 --> 02:38:32.054]  And both silver and gold in the future will move higher.
[02:38:32.054 --> 02:38:37.918]  We just had a big man-made correction, and that will be overcome.
[02:38:37.918 --> 02:38:39.720]  Is this the bottom?
[02:38:39.720 --> 02:38:41.041]  I don't know, but I don't care.
[02:38:41.041 --> 02:38:42.802]  We just keep on buying.
[02:38:42.802 --> 02:38:45.785]  Because it's the only safe place to be.
[02:38:45.785 --> 02:38:47.907]  It probably is the bottom.
[02:38:47.907 --> 02:38:51.750]  And we had a very good day today in the market, and it's continuing.
[02:38:52.726 --> 02:38:57.688]  And so there are a lot of peripheral things going on.
[02:38:57.688 --> 02:39:05.531]  The book by Jerome Corsi explaining the birth of the person who calls himself president.
[02:39:05.531 --> 02:39:08.552]  And then there's other things outside that.
[02:39:08.552 --> 02:39:19.455]  Now, Alex, as you know, I've been talking for the last couple of years about the possibility of government doing something to or with a 401Ks and IRAs.
[02:39:21.664 --> 02:39:24.665]  And I think that's getting closer and closer.
[02:39:24.665 --> 02:39:37.911]  Tip off here recently was we don't have the money to carry us up to August the 2nd when supposedly we're going to have an extension of the funding of debt.
[02:39:37.911 --> 02:39:47.355]  So what government has done instead of putting money into the retirement program like they're supposed to, they're not going to do that.
[02:39:47.355 --> 02:39:49.476]  They're going to use it to run the government.
[02:39:49.476 --> 02:39:51.177]  So what they're doing essentially
[02:39:51.980 --> 02:39:52.201]  Yes.
[02:39:59.895 --> 02:40:07.958]  The next step from there is the $6 trillion which are in retirement plans, those 401ks and IRAs.
[02:40:07.958 --> 02:40:22.304]  By the way, let me just briefly interrupt you because the very same international combine that is robbing Greece, now Spain, Portugal, trying to rob Iceland, Ireland, they're on record last week
[02:40:23.024 --> 02:40:49.818]  saying that the governments are saying now we're going to take your private pension funds and selling it like that's welfare your own pension fund and we've got mainline republicans pushing taking and cutting the pensions of public workers and union people when money's already been paid into that it's just been stolen out the back door so they're selling this austerity and they're also going to go after the private pension funds so folks need to get to their heads
[02:40:50.658 --> 02:41:02.330]  We need to write off the quadrillion plus in derivatives and not go out and rob the unions and the government pension funds because here's the other problem.
[02:41:02.330 --> 02:41:14.262]  They're going to play all of those public workers off against everybody else because they're going to be fighting for their financial future when at the end of the day we should be looking at the bankers first.
[02:41:17.025 --> 02:41:27.438]  Well you're right and the tactics will be formulated in a way that people will think it's good for them.
[02:41:27.438 --> 02:41:29.120]  We had a report come out and
[02:41:30.647 --> 02:41:55.182]  uh... in february called the annual report on middle class and um... in there it it talked about guaranteed retirement accounts of course that's by the government and the government would run the money and that means that they would use the money that presently was an IRAs and 401ks to fund the government and that would be one of the ways that they would fund the shortfall
[02:41:56.082 --> 02:41:59.665]  In the purchasing of Treasury and Agency paper.
[02:41:59.665 --> 02:42:04.288]  Agency is Fannie, Freddie, Ginnie, and FHA bonds.
[02:42:04.288 --> 02:42:14.236]  And so they're going to try to relieve some of the pressure on the Fed, like under QE3, they'll have to come up with a minimum of $1.7 trillion.
[02:42:14.236 --> 02:42:22.582]  And if they're going to replace what stimulus is not going to make available from the legislature, they're going to have to come up with $2.3 to $2.5 trillion.
[02:42:22.582 --> 02:42:25.685]  So they're trying to relieve them of that problem in part.
[02:42:25.905 --> 02:42:32.127]  And remember, they're already robbing everybody's pension funds, public, private, and savings with the inflation.
[02:42:32.127 --> 02:42:34.868]  What is the real unemployment at from your research?
[02:42:34.868 --> 02:42:36.788]  And what is the real inflation at?
[02:42:36.788 --> 02:42:38.069]  And where is inflation going?
[02:42:38.069 --> 02:42:41.790]  We now see they had a Walmart a month ago, Ben Bernanke this week.
[02:42:41.790 --> 02:42:45.351]  They're now admitting, hey, inflation is going up, but it's no big deal.
[02:42:46.923 --> 02:42:58.794]  Well it's around 10% and last May I made a prediction that we would have QE2 and stimulus on the same order of QE1 and we would have QE3.
[02:42:58.794 --> 02:43:07.782]  And I also said that inflation by the end of this year, now this is going to be a year and a half by the time we get there, would be 14% or higher.
[02:43:07.782 --> 02:43:08.743]  Right now it's around 10%.
[02:43:10.410 --> 02:43:11.391]  The government's talking 2.6%.
[02:43:11.391 --> 02:43:18.716]  And this is only this year.
[02:43:18.716 --> 02:43:21.758]  But everybody knows that's pure bull, Bob.
[02:43:21.758 --> 02:43:31.505]  Milk, eggs, meat, fuel, power bills, phone bills, everything's skyrocketing.
[02:43:31.505 --> 02:43:32.866]  And that's true and it's going to continue.
[02:43:33.672 --> 02:43:36.194]  As long as they continue to do what they're doing.
[02:43:36.194 --> 02:43:40.697]  And next year, we'll probably see 25 to 30 percent inflation.
[02:43:40.697 --> 02:43:43.699]  And they'll say it's 5 or 10 percent, whatever it is.
[02:43:43.699 --> 02:43:45.660]  And of course that won't be true.
[02:43:45.660 --> 02:43:50.363]  And then, if we have this QE3, which I think we will, we'll be looking at maybe 50 percent.
[02:43:50.523 --> 02:43:59.453]  By the way, Bob, you've been right about 97% of the time that I've been reading you for 14, 15 years and interviewing you for close to that.
[02:43:59.453 --> 02:44:04.518]  That's very frightening because you predicted everything that's happened so far to this point.
[02:44:04.518 --> 02:44:05.639]  You're saying 25, 30% next year.
[02:44:08.527 --> 02:44:11.688]  There's a good chance of that if they continue to do what they're doing.
[02:44:11.688 --> 02:44:16.770]  And then the following year, we could get up to 50%, which is called hyperinflation.
[02:44:16.770 --> 02:44:22.051]  It's the bottom edge, the beginning of hyperinflation.
[02:44:22.051 --> 02:44:25.513]  Some hyperinflations go 2,000 or 3,000 times.
[02:44:25.513 --> 02:44:30.554]  But, you know, for America, 50% is god-awful.
[02:44:30.554 --> 02:44:32.395]  Well, they can't give Wall Street a haircut!
[02:44:33.462 --> 02:44:35.564]  I mean, they can't give Wall Street a haircut.
[02:44:35.564 --> 02:44:36.766]  They're not going to do that.
[02:44:36.766 --> 02:44:44.314]  They're not going to ever be able to cut enough government and entitlements to ever fix this, so it looks like it's a foregone conclusion.
[02:44:44.314 --> 02:44:54.365]  Absolutely, and it's part of their plan to bring everything down so that everybody will say, please save me, feed me, put me in one of your camps so I'll be safe, and I'll accept world government.
[02:44:56.340 --> 02:44:57.021]  Let me stop you.
[02:45:11.994 --> 02:45:17.298]  Let me stop you because I want to reset here and I want you to take your time on this because that was my next point.
[02:45:17.298 --> 02:45:21.742]  Do you concur with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts that this is a setup?
[02:45:21.742 --> 02:45:30.569]  I mean, it's admitted that his head spin doctor and one of their campaign heads for Sarkozy did release the arrest before it even happened.
[02:45:31.149 --> 02:45:32.330]  I mean, that's admitted.
[02:45:32.330 --> 02:45:33.892]  They admit that.
[02:45:33.892 --> 02:45:38.216]  And it's admitted that they're acting like he's already guilty.
[02:45:38.216 --> 02:45:39.237]  I mean, I don't like this guy.
[02:45:39.237 --> 02:45:40.478]  I don't like globalists.
[02:45:40.478 --> 02:45:43.721]  But he had said that we're getting diminishing returns.
[02:45:43.721 --> 02:45:49.526]  We've ground the third world so bad that we might want to start forgiving some of this fiat debt.
[02:45:49.526 --> 02:45:51.989]  I mean, what's your intel on what happened with Khan?
[02:45:53.550 --> 02:45:59.034]  Well, of course, Wall Street's anathema to that, because they've been looting since 1948.
[02:45:59.034 --> 02:46:04.978]  Actually, the IMF was formed in 1944, but it really didn't function until 1948.
[02:46:04.978 --> 02:46:10.041]  And, you know, Craig... Paul Craig Roberts is correct.
[02:46:10.041 --> 02:46:11.902]  And it's as simple as that.
[02:46:11.902 --> 02:46:15.324]  I have a great insight into French politics.
[02:46:15.324 --> 02:46:18.847]  And the reason why is I've followed it very deeply for years.
[02:46:18.847 --> 02:46:20.428]  I speak French.
[02:46:20.428 --> 02:46:22.089]  And I went to the Université de Genève.
[02:46:22.931 --> 02:46:30.318]  And one of my good friends, I haven't talked to him for a long time, is your Marina Penn.
[02:46:30.318 --> 02:46:37.706]  He used to be the head of the National Front, and his daughter Marina is now the head of the National Front.
[02:46:37.706 --> 02:46:43.671]  And I've known her since she was a teenager, because I used to go to their home and have dinner and things like that.
[02:46:46.403 --> 02:46:58.768]  I noticed today that Madame Lagarde is being talked about to be the head of the IMF.
[02:46:58.768 --> 02:47:06.011]  Now, the reason they would do that is she's the natural one to run on the Socialist Party ticket.
[02:47:06.011 --> 02:47:10.533]  And she would be the next in line after Strauss-Kahn.
[02:47:10.533 --> 02:47:13.614]  But they want her out of the way because they want Sarkozy to win.
[02:47:14.699 --> 02:47:21.721]  And so, right now, Sarkozy is going to get, like, 35% of the vote prior to all this happening.
[02:47:21.721 --> 02:47:30.063]  And Marina's got 21, which is very high for them, because when Le Pen ran for the presidency, he only got 19%.
[02:47:30.063 --> 02:47:36.144]  He was disemboweled, if you may, from a political standpoint.
[02:47:36.144 --> 02:47:38.464]  Anyway, she's brilliant.
[02:47:38.464 --> 02:47:39.725]  She was trained as an attorney.
[02:47:41.084 --> 02:47:46.687]  A criminal attorney at that, and she's one of the nicest kids I ever met.
[02:47:46.687 --> 02:47:50.168]  But anyway, I think she's got a shot at him.
[02:47:50.168 --> 02:48:01.374]  And it's going to be very interesting because if the people in France say, we don't want this guy, and we really wanted Strauss-Kahn, maybe we should have this lady as our president.
[02:48:01.374 --> 02:48:08.317]  And by the way, the vast majority of the French do believe this was a setup with Dominique Strauss-Kahn.
[02:48:09.485 --> 02:48:10.345]  Without question.
[02:48:10.345 --> 02:48:13.746]  And my comment all week has been the same as yours.
[02:48:13.746 --> 02:48:16.227]  I don't care for him.
[02:48:16.227 --> 02:48:18.308]  And I never have.
[02:48:18.308 --> 02:48:20.129]  And I won't go into it.
[02:48:20.129 --> 02:48:21.769]  But there's no question.
[02:48:21.769 --> 02:48:23.710]  A man's a billionaire.
[02:48:23.710 --> 02:48:28.571]  Long, long line of very influential, wealthy, famous people.
[02:48:28.571 --> 02:48:35.734]  And he has the $3,000 suite, which he paid for, as far as I know.
[02:48:35.734 --> 02:48:38.855]  And men like that do not
[02:48:39.645 --> 02:48:43.086]  Pursue the things that he's been accused of.
[02:48:43.086 --> 02:48:45.047]  It's as simple as that.
[02:48:45.047 --> 02:48:46.167]  And he was set up.
[02:48:46.167 --> 02:48:49.528]  And probably there were intelligence agencies involved.
[02:48:49.528 --> 02:48:53.250]  Well, that guy could order up any women he wanted, and that's what they do.
[02:48:53.250 --> 02:48:56.091]  But sometimes these globalists do go wild like this.
[02:48:56.091 --> 02:48:58.031]  My issue is he may have even done it.
[02:48:58.031 --> 02:49:00.092]  They've removed the protection from him now.
[02:49:01.900 --> 02:49:03.241]  Either or.
[02:49:03.241 --> 02:49:18.051]  And it really doesn't make any difference at this point because he's out of the IMF, he won't run for the presidency, and their goal was to get rid of him in that powerful position, and he's been gotten rid of.
[02:49:18.051 --> 02:49:24.035]  I don't think people are sorry for him because he's in a hardball league, and he knew that.
[02:49:24.035 --> 02:49:29.799]  Well, Khan, it's admitted that Sarkozy put him as the head of the IMF to get him out of politics.
[02:49:31.052 --> 02:49:32.594]  Probably.
[02:49:32.594 --> 02:49:33.115]  Probably.
[02:49:33.115 --> 02:49:37.300]  Well, I'll tell you what's going on in Europe right now.
[02:49:37.300 --> 02:49:38.361]  Anything can happen.
[02:49:38.361 --> 02:49:39.363]  A marina could win.
[02:49:39.363 --> 02:49:47.593]  Alright, well looking at what's happening with Europe, you predicted three years ago that it would start in Ireland, Portugal and spread, that the euro would die.
[02:49:47.593 --> 02:49:48.915]  Where are we right now on that front?
[02:49:50.680 --> 02:49:54.141]  Well, Greece is not cooperating.
[02:49:54.141 --> 02:50:11.966]  Samaras, who's the head of the other party, the one that's not in power, which is Pompadreo's group, his father was president before him during the 80s, terrible crook number one, and an ardent communist.
[02:50:11.966 --> 02:50:12.686]  It's not going to work.
[02:50:13.972 --> 02:50:19.978]  Uh, the other party is not going to go along with their let's steal everything in the country program.
[02:50:19.978 --> 02:50:24.463]  And, uh, they're going to have to give them a partial default.
[02:50:24.463 --> 02:50:28.346]  And that'll last about two years, and the problem will be back again.
[02:50:28.346 --> 02:50:32.671]  And then they've got to deal with Ireland and Portugal, who are in the same positions.
[02:50:33.829 --> 02:50:36.010]  There's huge protests going on right now.
[02:50:36.010 --> 02:50:37.831]  Things are really heating up into a major powder keg.
[02:50:37.831 --> 02:50:39.352]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:01.735 --> 02:51:03.696]  He looks five years younger.
[02:51:03.696 --> 02:51:06.498]  He doesn't fall asleep at his desk like he used to.
[02:51:06.498 --> 02:51:09.239]  He no longer drinks those energy drinks all day.
[02:51:09.239 --> 02:51:10.800]  He used to be gloomy.
[02:51:10.800 --> 02:51:11.861]  Now he's upbeat.
[02:51:11.861 --> 02:51:13.962]  He obviously has lost weight.
[02:51:13.962 --> 02:51:17.604]  He's now drinking Moringa in the Morning from BigJoe.us.
[02:51:18.064 --> 02:51:28.011]  Moringa is a delicious, all-organic, 100% bioavailable blend from the Miracle Moringa Tree, considered by many to be the most nutrient-rich plant ever discovered.
[02:51:28.011 --> 02:51:33.995]  Moringa in the morning will suppress cravings for junk food and energy drinks, and make you feel like a kid again.
[02:51:34.395 --> 02:51:35.976]  Drink Moringa in the Morning.
[02:51:35.976 --> 02:51:38.397]  Available from BigJoe.us.
[02:51:38.397 --> 02:51:42.119]  That's B-I-G-J-O-E dot US.
[02:51:42.119 --> 02:51:45.860]  Vibrant Health is just a click or call away at BigJoe.us or 800-503-0515.
[02:51:45.860 --> 02:51:45.920]  800-503-0515.
[02:51:45.920 --> 02:51:46.280]  That's 800-503-0515.
[02:51:46.280 --> 02:51:47.781]  Drink Moringa in the Morning.
[02:52:01.223 --> 02:52:03.044]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:52:03.044 --> 02:52:18.591]  The earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear disaster that killed thousands of Japanese citizens is nothing compared to the devastation that could be caused by hyperinflation that will soon hit the United States and could lead to millions of Americans becoming homeless, all caused by the devalued U.S.
[02:52:18.591 --> 02:52:18.931]  dollar.
[02:52:18.931 --> 02:52:24.374]  While the mainstream media continues to ignore inflation, our friends at the National Inflation Association provide
[02:52:24.614 --> 02:52:29.838]  A free weekly newsletter that educates Americans of the facts and truth about the US economy and inflation.
[02:52:29.838 --> 02:52:39.946]  I urge you to sign up at the NIA's free newsletter at www.inflation.us to learn how you can not only survive, but prosper during the upcoming hyperinflation crisis.
[02:52:39.946 --> 02:52:45.991]  Silver has more than doubled since the NIA declared silver the best investment for the next decade on inflation.us.
[02:52:46.331 --> 02:52:55.822]  The NIA's team of expert economists are happy to answer any economic questions you have about inflation, debt, currencies, real estate, precious metals, and commodities.
[02:52:55.822 --> 02:53:00.767]  Visit inflation.us to learn the economic truth that the mainstream media ignores.
[02:53:01.428 --> 02:53:01.728]  I think so.
[02:53:30.792 --> 02:53:32.033]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:53:32.033 --> 02:53:36.596]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:53:36.596 --> 02:53:42.400]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:53:42.400 --> 02:53:46.042]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:53:46.042 --> 02:53:48.764]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:53:48.764 --> 02:53:53.828]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:53:53.828 --> 02:53:54.068]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:53:54.068 --> 02:53:55.469]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:54:07.018 --> 02:54:11.102]  We're going to go five minutes into the next hour to take a few of your phone calls.
[02:54:11.102 --> 02:54:12.403]  I appreciate everybody holding.
[02:54:12.403 --> 02:54:15.085]  There's a bunch of news I didn't even get to, and I'll have it covered.
[02:54:15.085 --> 02:54:16.587]  It's Sunday.
[02:54:16.587 --> 02:54:21.031]  Government orders YouTube to censor protest videos, and it's...
[02:54:22.782 --> 02:54:24.066]  Legal actions are being taken.
[02:54:24.066 --> 02:54:28.377]  It says this content is unavailable in your country to government removal by request.
[02:54:31.431 --> 02:54:32.991]  More abuses there.
[02:54:32.991 --> 02:54:36.272]  New biometrics technology allows government to know what you're thinking.
[02:54:36.272 --> 02:54:37.613]  Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:54:37.613 --> 02:54:38.453]  That's the claim.
[02:54:38.453 --> 02:54:42.434]  It's just quackery where they can then claim you're a terrorist because the computer says so.
[02:54:42.434 --> 02:54:49.216]  You know, like lie detectors were proven to be a fraud decades ago, but still people went to the gas chamber for it.
[02:54:49.216 --> 02:54:55.837]  Also, University Campus Watch citizen spy program partners with Threat Fusion.
[02:54:55.837 --> 02:54:57.858]  Senator reports suspicious activity.
[02:54:59.018 --> 02:55:02.521]  They're integrating those into the local spy centers.
[02:55:02.521 --> 02:55:05.803]  Big Sis and DHS push ID program for travelers.
[02:55:05.803 --> 02:55:11.667]  You're still going to get groped, but now they'll openly decide whether you get groped or not by giving you a special card.
[02:55:11.667 --> 02:55:15.750]  That's part of these internal passports.
[02:55:15.750 --> 02:55:18.732]  Bob Chapman, it is just getting crazier and crazier.
[02:55:18.732 --> 02:55:20.434]  What do you make of the U.S.
[02:55:20.434 --> 02:55:26.258]  Supreme Court and the Indiana Supreme Court, particularly the Indiana, openly saying in the decision that
[02:55:27.737 --> 02:55:35.360]  The Fourth Amendment was evil, and that a great evil has been defeated, and now the cops will come in your house for any reason or no reason at all.
[02:55:35.360 --> 02:55:40.901]  I mean, these people are just consciously being evil.
[02:55:40.901 --> 02:55:49.024]  That's right, and there are policemen, law enforcement people, much to our chagrin, who are criminals.
[02:55:50.151 --> 02:55:52.573]  And that's been proven over and over again.
[02:55:52.573 --> 02:56:00.260]  And so people who have their house invaded by police because they have to pick their house might find things missing from their homes.
[02:56:02.298 --> 02:56:17.224]  For some time, we've had policing organizations in different states preying upon people by stopping their vehicles and searching them, and if they have any money, say $5,000 or $10,000 or more, they confiscate it.
[02:56:20.455 --> 02:56:29.125]  This has been going on for a long time, but now that the states are so hard up for money, they're making a racket out of it, and they admit it.
[02:56:29.125 --> 02:56:35.913]  In fact, I have a video in tomorrow's issue explaining that in detail.
[02:56:36.904 --> 02:56:38.125]  Very, very interesting.
[02:56:38.125 --> 02:56:45.988]  Well, that's gone on for a long time, Bob, but now they're even taking a couple hundred bucks, and from old ladies and stuff, and then admitting they're doing it.
[02:56:45.988 --> 02:56:48.469]  I mean, no judge, no jury, no arrest.
[02:56:48.469 --> 02:56:51.250]  I mean, it's just total highway robbery.
[02:56:51.250 --> 02:57:02.154]  And the police chief was asked in Tennessee, what happens, do these policemen lose their job if they don't find lots of money?
[02:57:02.154 --> 02:57:03.275]  And he said they could.
[02:57:04.835 --> 02:57:08.017]  So, I mean, this is a criminal enterprise.
[02:57:08.017 --> 02:57:09.578]  It's unbelievable.
[02:57:09.578 --> 02:57:11.120]  Well, that's going to be in tomorrow's issue.
[02:57:11.120 --> 02:57:12.040]  Yeah, let's be clear.
[02:57:12.040 --> 02:57:12.701]  Let's be clear.
[02:57:12.701 --> 02:57:15.162]  And we posted the video a few days ago on InfoWars.
[02:57:15.162 --> 02:57:16.283]  I've seen it.
[02:57:16.283 --> 02:57:17.444]  I should have played that effect.
[02:57:17.444 --> 02:57:19.205]  I mean, that's what I'm saying, folks.
[02:57:19.205 --> 02:57:20.466]  There's so much.
[02:57:20.466 --> 02:57:23.689]  I'm used to cops, corrupt cops did this quietly.
[02:57:23.689 --> 02:57:28.412]  Now they go on TV and are proud of it.
[02:57:28.412 --> 02:57:29.993]  Go ahead, Bob.
[02:57:29.993 --> 02:57:30.914]  You're absolutely right.
[02:57:30.914 --> 02:57:31.914]  They are.
[02:57:31.914 --> 02:57:32.995]  And they think it's OK.
[02:57:32.995 --> 02:57:33.616]  Anything goes.
[02:57:34.600 --> 02:57:37.422]  And I also cover, at the beginning of the U.S.
[02:57:37.422 --> 02:57:56.572]  section tomorrow, what we've talked about regarding the commandeering, actually, in the future, the distinct possibility of that, of 401ks and IRAs, and there's another bill been presented, SEAL, it's called S-E-A-L,
[02:57:57.232 --> 02:58:06.697]  And they're also talking nationally about another withholding where they take it and claim it's a government 401k for you, like social security, but you have social security and this new private one.
[02:58:06.697 --> 02:58:08.478]  That's right.
[02:58:08.478 --> 02:58:10.819]  And it flows into the general fund and they steal it all.
[02:58:26.738 --> 02:58:27.659]  Well, why shouldn't they?
[02:58:27.659 --> 02:58:29.320]  Unbelievable!
[02:58:29.320 --> 02:58:30.460]  I mean, why shouldn't they, Bob?
[02:58:30.460 --> 02:58:33.923]  They've got cops coast-to-coast taking money out of old ladies' purses.
[02:58:33.923 --> 02:58:35.544]  I mean, it's just insane.
[02:58:35.544 --> 02:58:37.605]  Back in one minute, five more minutes with Bob Chapman.
[02:58:37.605 --> 02:58:38.866]  We'll jam in a few of your phone calls.
[02:58:38.866 --> 02:58:44.689]  Stay with us.
[02:58:44.689 --> 02:58:47.932]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:47.932 --> 02:58:49.853]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:53.649 --> 02:58:57.610]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:58:57.610 --> 02:59:06.472]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:59:06.472 --> 02:59:11.093]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:59:11.093 --> 02:59:21.915]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:59:22.535 --> 02:59:32.057]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:59:32.057 --> 02:59:37.479]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:59:37.479 --> 02:59:44.960]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:59:44.960 --> 02:59:47.721]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:59:52.543 --> 02:59:56.151]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:56.151 --> 02:59:59.358]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:12.068 --> 03:00:18.452]  You want to get a free complimentary copy, digitally or hard copy, of the latest international forecaster, you can call 1-800-686-2237.
[03:00:18.452 --> 03:00:26.117]  1-800-686-2237 when you call Midas Resources.
[03:00:26.117 --> 03:00:29.079]  I wish I could get to all these calls, but let's try to jam in some.
[03:00:29.079 --> 03:00:30.560]  Stan and PA, you're on the air.
[03:00:30.560 --> 03:00:31.160]  Thanks for holding.
[03:00:31.160 --> 03:00:32.121]  You're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[03:00:32.813 --> 03:00:34.094]  Thank you very much.
[03:00:34.094 --> 03:00:44.300]  Alex, I was on hold for, heck, an hour and a half at least regarding the pre-tribulation issue that you brought up earlier.
[03:00:44.300 --> 03:00:45.481]  Is that alright if I talk about that?
[03:00:45.481 --> 03:00:46.581]  Yeah, no, but we don't have time.
[03:00:46.581 --> 03:00:47.482]  You don't have to preface it.
[03:00:47.482 --> 03:00:56.988]  Yeah, people saying that the world's going to, that it raptures tomorrow, and that's in these same groups do this over and over again, and it's idiocy.
[03:00:56.988 --> 03:00:57.328]  Go ahead.
[03:00:58.817 --> 03:01:05.227]  I'm the founder of a small disability ministry, 501c, tax exempt non-profit.
[03:01:05.700 --> 03:01:16.568]  And we deal with this all the time, and really, that's an outgrowth of the prosperity gospel, and shortly defined, the prosperity gospel is naming and claiming.
[03:01:16.568 --> 03:01:23.874]  In other words, if I, in Jesus' name, if I believe I should be driving a Mercedes-Benz, well, I claim it in Jesus' name.
[03:01:23.874 --> 03:01:34.042]  And if they, you know, in regards to suffering, which you were getting to earlier, they believe that suffering only happens because one of two reasons, and that's because it's either the devil's fault,
[03:01:35.052 --> 03:01:37.433]  Or it's sin in that person's life.
[03:01:37.433 --> 03:01:40.173]  Now, I had a daughter who, at two, she stopped talking.
[03:01:40.173 --> 03:01:41.553]  At two and a half, she stopped walking.
[03:01:41.553 --> 03:01:43.934]  At two and three quarters, the seizure started.
[03:01:43.934 --> 03:01:48.175]  And she had two disease states, Batten disease and Williams syndrome.
[03:01:48.175 --> 03:01:51.956]  Long story short, we're actually receiving a patent for our work.
[03:01:51.956 --> 03:01:53.936]  We extended her life five years.
[03:01:53.936 --> 03:01:58.437]  She passed on about two and a half years ago.
[03:01:58.437 --> 03:02:00.818]  And this is for God's glory.
[03:02:00.818 --> 03:02:02.538]  And her life was for God.
[03:02:03.899 --> 03:02:09.447]  Because when the disciples came upon the blind man, they said, hey Jesus, who sinned?
[03:02:09.447 --> 03:02:10.489]  This man or his parents?
[03:02:10.489 --> 03:02:12.312]  And Jesus said, neither sinned.
[03:02:12.312 --> 03:02:14.234]  This man was born this way for the glory of God.
[03:02:14.234 --> 03:02:15.156]  And then he healed him.
[03:02:17.128 --> 03:02:17.868]  That's right.
[03:02:17.868 --> 03:02:20.089]  Nobody can calculate God's plan.
[03:02:20.089 --> 03:02:22.290]  Stan, I'd love to talk more, but we're almost out of time.
[03:02:22.290 --> 03:02:28.832]  What do you think about these movements with the 2012 for the people that aren't religious to buy into the world?
[03:02:28.832 --> 03:02:32.573]  Christian groups, Catholic, Protestant pushing it.
[03:02:32.573 --> 03:02:35.874]  I mean, do you agree with me, Bob, that it's a way to just get people to think it's all over?
[03:02:35.874 --> 03:02:39.295]  So why should they be involved in anything and just lay down?
[03:02:39.295 --> 03:02:41.276]  Yes, and it's an ultimate distraction.
[03:02:41.276 --> 03:02:44.417]  There's nothing closer to people than their religion.
[03:02:45.291 --> 03:02:50.595]  And to distort it is very powerful.
[03:02:50.595 --> 03:02:52.256]  Yeah, I mean, I'm just sick and tired of it.
[03:02:52.256 --> 03:02:54.498]  I mean, let's say the world's gonna end next month.
[03:02:54.498 --> 03:02:57.360]  You're still supposed to stand up against evil and corruption.
[03:02:57.360 --> 03:03:00.022]  It's the ultimate cop-out!
[03:03:00.022 --> 03:03:01.823]  That's right.
[03:03:01.823 --> 03:03:04.385]  So you gotta keep on doing what you're doing, and if it ends, it ends.
[03:03:04.385 --> 03:03:05.266]  That's too bad.
[03:03:08.410 --> 03:03:12.297]  Well, they've only had this doctrine the last 150 years, and I know you've studied history.
[03:03:12.297 --> 03:03:17.125]  How many times have people laid down to tyrants thinking it's the end of the world?
[03:03:17.125 --> 03:03:18.528]  Oh, it goes back for centuries.
[03:03:18.528 --> 03:03:19.570]  Look at the early Christians.
[03:03:22.103 --> 03:03:32.608]  And who knows before that we don't have, you know, complete histories of things that happened perhaps 200 years and further before the birth of Christ.
[03:03:32.608 --> 03:03:38.191]  The great library in Alexandria was wiped out by fire.
[03:03:38.191 --> 03:03:40.032]  Probably had most of the world's history in there.
[03:03:40.032 --> 03:03:42.633]  Yeah, it did.
[03:03:42.633 --> 03:03:44.734]  Really, it's a way to give up.
[03:03:45.754 --> 03:03:46.274]  It certainly is.
[03:03:46.274 --> 03:03:48.315]  Well, we try to help those people and do the best we can doing it.
[03:04:15.481 --> 03:04:16.602]  And that's okay.
[03:04:16.602 --> 03:04:18.923]  That's a burden that we have to carry.
[03:04:18.923 --> 03:04:25.387]  Bob, it was great having you on this week, and I look forward to having you on with us next Friday ahead of the holiday weekend.
[03:04:25.387 --> 03:04:26.828]  And be safe, my friend.
[03:04:26.828 --> 03:04:30.531]  We really appreciate you there at TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[03:04:30.531 --> 03:04:33.372]  Well, thank you very much, and thank you all for listening.
[03:04:33.372 --> 03:04:34.753]  We really appreciate it.
[03:04:34.753 --> 03:04:35.274]  We do.
[03:04:35.274 --> 03:04:37.015]  And folks are waking up, Bob.
[03:04:37.015 --> 03:04:41.117]  The awakening's happening faster and faster.
[03:04:41.117 --> 03:04:43.519]  We're breathing down their necks, as you say.
[03:04:44.363 --> 03:04:44.783]  All right, buddy.
[03:04:44.783 --> 03:04:45.624]  We'll talk to you soon.
[03:04:45.624 --> 03:04:47.224]  Great job to the crew.
[03:04:47.224 --> 03:04:48.145]  Everybody have a great weekend.
[03:04:48.145 --> 03:04:49.725]  I'll see you back Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:04:49.725 --> 03:04:51.466]  Sorry to all the other callers.
[03:04:51.466 --> 03:04:54.487]  I didn't even get to a lot of the news today, but I'm getting better about it.
[03:04:54.487 --> 03:04:57.268]  Keep watching Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:04:57.268 --> 03:04:59.289]  Keep spreading the word.
[03:04:59.289 --> 03:05:01.010]  We're supposed to be the salt of the earth, folks.
