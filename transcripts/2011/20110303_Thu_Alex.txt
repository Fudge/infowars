[00:00:04.844 --> 00:00:09.668]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.668 --> 00:00:11.249]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:12.811]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.811 --> 00:00:16.994]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.994 --> 00:00:21.097]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.882 --> 00:00:30.243]  We're live, my friends.
[00:00:30.243 --> 00:00:34.464]  It is Thursday, the third day of March 2011.
[00:00:34.464 --> 00:00:40.507]  I had to bail out of the broadcast yesterday with a 24-hour stomach bug.
[00:00:40.507 --> 00:00:44.268]  Now my wife and other children have it.
[00:00:44.268 --> 00:00:49.970]  I guess my oldest daughter brought it home from playing with her friends, but I bailed out yesterday.
[00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:55.853]  I appreciate Paul Watson and Aaron Dykes taking over for us, but I'm about 95% back and
[00:00:59.134 --> 00:01:04.939]  I wanna thank you for joining us today because obviously there is so much important information.
[00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:22.953]  I thought about not coming in this morning when I still felt a bit wheezy when I got up about 7 a.m., but I saw the news and knew that I absolutely had to come in here and cover all of this news and information today, so we're gonna be breaking it all down.
[00:01:22.953 --> 00:01:24.675]  Very important broadcast.
[00:01:24.675 --> 00:01:27.097]  Max Keiser was in Beirut, Lebanon.
[00:01:28.097 --> 00:01:33.542]  On Tuesday, today he is in Cairo, Egypt and is joining us later in the broadcast.
[00:01:33.542 --> 00:01:36.684]  It may even be video Skype, but whatever works better.
[00:01:36.684 --> 00:01:48.353]  We'll be having him either audio or video and audio today with a report from the embattled North African nation of Egypt, the epicenter of the turmoil we're seeing.
[00:01:48.353 --> 00:01:50.094]  Here's the London Telegraph headline.
[00:01:50.094 --> 00:01:54.077]  Saudi Arabia contagion triggers Gulf route.
[00:01:54.077 --> 00:01:56.779]  Oil prices continuing to go up as the
[00:01:59.201 --> 00:02:06.487]  Arab country dumps billions more in welfare and emergency welfare to the public trying to stem riots.
[00:02:08.558 --> 00:02:13.620]  They've also sent tanks to Bahrain, nearby country to Saudi Arabia.
[00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.462]  We have the Wall Street Journal echoing what Porter Stansbury and EndOfAmerica3.com has been covering.
[00:02:20.462 --> 00:02:23.083]  Why the dollar's reign is near an end.
[00:02:23.083 --> 00:02:28.825]  For decades the dollar has served as the world's main reserve currency, but argues Barry
[00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:32.864]  I can green it will soon have to share that role.
[00:02:32.864 --> 00:02:37.251]  Here's why and what it will mean for international markets and companies.
[00:02:37.251 --> 00:02:40.457]  What will it mean for American consumers and purchasers?
[00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:44.301]  What will it mean for people on fixed incomes?
[00:02:44.301 --> 00:02:56.588]  And I read this article, they don't really hit the main issue of the fact that the dollar will then accelerate, is the key word, its hyperinflation curve once the other shoe drops.
[00:02:56.588 --> 00:02:58.389]  That's the big issue here.
[00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:01.652]  Not so much what's gonna happen in markets around the world.
[00:03:02.872 --> 00:03:11.456]  And also we have reports dealing with jobless claims, what's happening in China with their currency.
[00:03:11.456 --> 00:03:13.516]  That is all coming up today.
[00:03:13.516 --> 00:03:18.338]  I had about an hour and a half talk with Charlie Sheen last night.
[00:03:18.338 --> 00:03:18.718]  Boy, if
[00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:24.302]  These hills could talk, but I won't be talking about it.
[00:03:24.302 --> 00:03:26.763]  But it does look like there's a light at the end of the tunnel.
[00:03:26.763 --> 00:03:30.346]  In fact, what I'll do is you guys remind me and make me do this.
[00:03:30.346 --> 00:03:33.168]  At 1.30, we got 30 minutes left in the broadcast.
[00:03:33.168 --> 00:03:37.310]  I'll spend five minutes on what I can tell you about Charlie Sheen.
[00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.111]  I've got to think about it.
[00:03:38.111 --> 00:03:44.075]  He didn't tell me not to talk about the things he told me, but I just he talks to me because I never talk about it.
[00:03:44.075 --> 00:03:45.336]  But so much is going on.
[00:03:45.336 --> 00:03:49.919]  If I can talk about it to try to help Charlie and let folks know where he is mentally,
[00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:58.821]  And economically, and we're two-and-a-half mens going, obviously we are the epicenter of what happened with Charlie Sheen starting seven days ago.
[00:03:58.821 --> 00:04:04.022]  Last Thursday, here on the broadcast, I was blindsided by it just like you were.
[00:04:04.022 --> 00:04:07.762]  Now it is still the biggest story, not in the United States, but worldwide.
[00:04:07.762 --> 00:04:12.643]  Bigger than the economic meltdown that we are now going deeper into.
[00:04:12.643 --> 00:04:15.564]  And obviously I don't think that should be the case, but it is the case.
[00:04:16.224 --> 00:04:18.305]  And Charlie didn't ask for any of this to happen.
[00:04:18.305 --> 00:04:22.827]  He just was tired of being harassed and suppressed and quote the AA cult.
[00:04:22.827 --> 00:04:33.091]  But I will give you some tidbits of news mainly because the mainstream media keeps calling here in droves asking me questions or asking for Charlie's number and I'm not giving it to him.
[00:04:33.091 --> 00:04:39.714]  But if the mainstream media and those obsessed with these things want to hear about it, I'll spend five minutes on it at 1.30 Central Standard Time.
[00:04:39.714 --> 00:04:42.095]  We come out of break today.
[00:04:42.095 --> 00:04:42.676]  Obviously,
[00:04:44.465 --> 00:04:47.029]  This has turned into some good things.
[00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:56.722]  Millions and millions of people who've never heard of the Alex Jones Show are finding it, and our numbers across the board are off the charts right now.
[00:04:56.722 --> 00:04:59.566]  So, certainly a lot of people are learning about the New World Order.
[00:05:00.185 --> 00:05:04.028]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot Movement.
[00:05:04.028 --> 00:05:08.311]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[00:05:08.311 --> 00:05:12.995]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[00:05:12.995 --> 00:05:18.959]  Not looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:26.184]  Not worried about them moving south, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[00:05:28.761 --> 00:05:34.269]  I'm looking for America.
[00:05:34.269 --> 00:05:35.891]  We're American and be proud.
[00:05:35.891 --> 00:05:38.594]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[00:05:54.699 --> 00:06:00.302]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[00:06:00.302 --> 00:06:03.884]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:06:03.884 --> 00:06:05.184]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:06:05.184 --> 00:06:09.587]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:06:09.587 --> 00:06:15.529]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:17.671]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:06:17.671 --> 00:06:20.352]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[00:06:20.692 --> 00:06:27.198]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[00:06:27.198 --> 00:06:29.399]  They both make fabulous investments.
[00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:34.744]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[00:06:34.744 --> 00:06:40.029]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:45.193]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[00:06:45.393 --> 00:06:48.595]  This will freeze the cost your food while you can still afford it.
[00:06:48.595 --> 00:06:51.597]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[00:06:51.597 --> 00:06:52.357]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[00:07:03.826 --> 00:07:05.087]  Tyranny is here.
[00:07:05.087 --> 00:07:08.811]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:07:08.811 --> 00:07:11.254]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:07:11.254 --> 00:07:17.120]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:23.347]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:07:23.767 --> 00:07:29.728]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:07:29.728 --> 00:07:33.929]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:07:33.929 --> 00:07:38.210]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:44.171]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:07:44.171 --> 00:07:47.711]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:07:47.711 --> 00:07:49.692]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:07:49.692 --> 00:07:50.132]  It's here.

[00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:05.745]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:05.745 --> 00:08:08.027]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:11.843 --> 00:08:15.406]  There certainly is a war on for your mind.
[00:08:15.406 --> 00:08:17.188]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:08:17.188 --> 00:08:22.252]  It is Thursday, the third day of March 2011.
[00:08:22.252 --> 00:08:30.098]  Max Keiser joins us coming up in the next hour from Cairo, Egypt on all the things that he's witnessing unfolding there.
[00:08:31.079 --> 00:08:35.944]  In other news, first call for impeachment by a member of Congress.
[00:08:35.944 --> 00:08:43.190]  Absolutely, Trent Frankstel's blog, citing abandonment of the DOMA law.
[00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:54.981]  Republican congressman has told a left-leaning blog that there is a collective support he would favor the impeachment of Barack Obama over his decision to stop defending the Federal Defense of Marriage Act.
[00:08:55.601 --> 00:08:58.863]  Scott Keyes of ThinkProgress.org asked U.S.
[00:08:58.863 --> 00:09:16.652]  Representative Trent Franks of Arizona, a Republican, I know Duke Enrich has come out and said that if they don't reverse course here, we ought to be talking about possibly impeaching either Attorney General Eric Holder or even President Obama to try to get them to reverse course.
[00:09:16.652 --> 00:09:18.753]  Do you think that is something you would support?
[00:09:18.753 --> 00:09:20.294]  And the Congressman said yes.
[00:09:20.894 --> 00:09:22.414]  So we have that here.
[00:09:22.414 --> 00:09:26.255]  Hillary Clinton told Congress on U.S.
[00:09:26.255 --> 00:09:31.637]  Foreign Policy Priority Committee yesterday that, quote, we're losing the info war.
[00:09:31.637 --> 00:09:35.778]  That is the globalists that have hijacked this nation and much of the rest of the world.
[00:09:35.778 --> 00:09:39.878]  She used the term info war, saying no one believes the U.S.
[00:09:39.878 --> 00:09:41.319]  media anymore.
[00:09:41.319 --> 00:09:41.739]  That's right.
[00:09:42.908 --> 00:09:47.873]  The only way you can hurt someone is by endorsing them, Hillary.
[00:09:47.873 --> 00:09:54.260]  That's what I told Politico last year about Rand Paul when they were trying to destroy him in the media with lies.
[00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:55.742]  I said, don't you get it?
[00:09:55.742 --> 00:10:00.286]  The only way the mainstream media can defeat Rand Paul is by endorsing him.
[00:10:01.087 --> 00:10:09.532]  When you attack us, you only validate what we're doing because you are completely and totally discredited.
[00:10:09.532 --> 00:10:12.814]  I want to play that clip of Hillary coming up a little bit later.
[00:10:12.814 --> 00:10:15.716]  Also, continuing here, top Republicans
[00:10:16.656 --> 00:10:18.518]  are shying away from presidential bids.
[00:10:18.518 --> 00:10:23.682]  More prominent Republicans have taken themselves out of contention for 2012 U.S.
[00:10:23.682 --> 00:10:28.045]  presidential race and have officially joined the contest to challenge Barack Obama.
[00:10:28.045 --> 00:10:32.008]  And we'll talk more about why they say that that is happening.
[00:10:32.008 --> 00:10:35.872]  Continuing here, the Wisconsin stalemate could drag on for months.
[00:10:35.872 --> 00:10:39.154]  The Associated Press is reporting.
[00:10:39.154 --> 00:10:43.197]  That's just some of the news that we're going to be going over on that front.
[00:10:43.197 --> 00:10:45.579]  And of course the really big news is on the
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:47.121]  We're good to go.
[00:10:58.851 --> 00:11:01.032]  They talk about how it will affect markets.
[00:11:01.032 --> 00:11:05.514]  They're talking about it like it's no big deal and not a bad thing.
[00:11:05.514 --> 00:11:07.394]  And they don't really talk about what's going to be replacing it.
[00:11:07.394 --> 00:11:20.339]  Well, the global SDR Bancorp digital currency that the private Ponzi scheme operating banking families will now have backed up by our tax money and the global carbon tax.
[00:11:20.339 --> 00:11:21.080]  So that's coming up.
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:27.622]  Here is another report mirroring the statements in the Wall Street Journal from Time Magazine.
[00:11:27.622 --> 00:11:30.943]  Are America's best days behind us?
[00:11:30.943 --> 00:11:35.325]  That calls up a line from Merle Haggard.
[00:11:35.325 --> 00:11:37.745]  I wish your buck was still silver.
[00:11:37.745 --> 00:11:40.987]  It was back when the country was strong.
[00:11:40.987 --> 00:11:44.828]  Back before Elvis and the Vietnam War came along.
[00:11:46.121 --> 00:11:48.323]  For the Beatles and yesterday.
[00:11:48.323 --> 00:11:50.445]  So they're telling us America is done.
[00:11:50.445 --> 00:11:51.486]  It's a lie.
[00:11:51.486 --> 00:12:03.296]  We could end this globalist dictatorship any time we wake up and recognize that globalism has de-industrialized this country, that globalism has been a cancer on our republic.
[00:12:03.296 --> 00:12:09.361]  Continuing with the currency issues, Reuters reports China's aim is to settle nationwide trade.
[00:12:10.342 --> 00:12:11.463]  See you next time!
[00:12:26.037 --> 00:12:27.579]  And so we won't have any industry left.
[00:12:27.579 --> 00:12:30.182]  We won't have any relief and service left.
[00:12:30.182 --> 00:12:35.168]  All we'll have is propaganda that's generated out of the mainstream media in this country.
[00:12:35.168 --> 00:12:37.290]  That's discredited and worthless.
[00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:38.571]  No one wants to buy into that anymore.
[00:12:38.571 --> 00:12:40.053]  That's a good thing.
[00:12:40.053 --> 00:12:45.799]  The globalists have basically sucked us dry and used our name to run their operations and driven us into the dirt.
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:53.065]  But we can wake up and rebuke them and tell them, get out of our lives and stand up against them any day we want.
[00:12:53.065 --> 00:13:08.515]  Or we can continue to be diverted and distracted by the false left-right distractionary paradigm that the system is using so successfully still against the population of this country and the planet.
[00:13:08.515 --> 00:13:12.378]  But China aims to settle nationwide trade in yuan this year.
[00:13:13.318 --> 00:13:23.567]  So the move towards completely decoupling the dollar from World Reserve currency status is now reaching a fever pace.
[00:13:23.567 --> 00:13:26.350]  Also, Bloomberg reports announced U.S.
[00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:30.273]  job cuts rose 20 percent from a year ago.
[00:13:30.273 --> 00:13:32.995]  And it says employers in the U.S.
[00:13:32.995 --> 00:13:35.618]  announced more job cuts in February than the last month.
[00:13:36.867 --> 00:13:37.628]  I don't think so.
[00:14:03.399 --> 00:14:13.147]  So, job cuts slowed from last year, but only because of government hiring.
[00:14:13.147 --> 00:14:16.329]  Only government is growing.
[00:14:16.329 --> 00:14:23.935]  Now, some local governments are actually cutting massively, and the police and sheriff's departments are openly stating, oh hey, guess what?
[00:14:23.935 --> 00:14:27.778]  We are now going to not really respond to crime.
[00:14:27.778 --> 00:14:30.861]  We're now just a revenue generation system.
[00:14:32.867 --> 00:14:34.449]  So employers in the U.S.
[00:14:34.449 --> 00:14:40.656]  announced more job cuts in February than the same month last year, led by a surge at government agencies.
[00:14:40.656 --> 00:14:44.840]  Very confusing article because it says they hired more, but they also let off more.
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.063]  Reading this, it's hard to even understand what they're saying.
[00:14:47.063 --> 00:14:54.191]  More job cuts at federal level are expected in the months ahead as pressure mounts to cut costs and rein in soaring national debt.
[00:14:58.069 --> 00:14:59.511]  Very strange article.
[00:14:59.511 --> 00:15:01.793]  I can't even understand what it's saying, really.
[00:15:01.793 --> 00:15:03.455]  Here's some interesting science news.
[00:15:03.455 --> 00:15:08.160]  Tractor beam is possible with lasers, says scientist.
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:14.787]  A laser can act as a tractor beam, drawing small objects back towards the laser source, scientists have said.
[00:15:14.787 --> 00:15:16.529]  That's BBC.
[00:15:16.529 --> 00:15:18.671]  Here's another interesting article in the Science
[00:15:19.652 --> 00:15:20.352]  Uh, category.
[00:15:20.352 --> 00:15:22.754]  And this is from Space.com.
[00:15:22.754 --> 00:15:29.577]  Air Force X-37B space plane launching on secret mission tomorrow.
[00:15:29.577 --> 00:15:30.997]  It's second mission.
[00:15:30.997 --> 00:15:36.680]  Of course, more than 80% of shuttle and overall NASA missions are secret and are military.
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:38.400]  And most of it has nothing to do with defense.
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:40.641]  It's about offensive weapon systems.
[00:15:40.641 --> 00:15:44.423]  And it's about surveilling people here in the United States.
[00:15:44.423 --> 00:15:45.884]  Just like it came out a few months ago.
[00:15:46.804 --> 00:16:15.117]  What, in January, that the US-slash-EU-German combine to launch, quote, global warming monitoring satellites had nothing to do with it, that it was all infrared systems to spy on the people of the West, and once they get your infrared signal on the ground, they can then tell who you are from space biometrically from the heat signature of your shoulders and the top of your head.
[00:16:16.104 --> 00:16:21.166]  Every time I talk about that, I get emails going, they can't see your face from space unless you're looking up.
[00:16:21.166 --> 00:16:22.106]  That's not what I just said.
[00:16:22.106 --> 00:16:27.248]  This is what Bob Woodward three years ago wrote about being the secret weapon in Iraq.
[00:16:27.248 --> 00:16:36.371]  They get a heat resonance scan off of you, off of a heat scanning camera, infrared camera on the street.
[00:16:36.371 --> 00:16:40.292]  They attach that then to your license plate to confirm your identity.
[00:16:41.756 --> 00:16:54.443]  They can also run it through a face scan that the camera also runs, then connect that face scan and sync it up for ID purposes with the heat resonance scan and then track you by space everywhere you go.
[00:16:54.443 --> 00:16:59.826]  Okay, continuing along those lines.
[00:16:59.826 --> 00:17:04.068]  We're going to get more into that later in the broadcast today.
[00:17:05.694 --> 00:17:13.544]  But I do want to continue where we left off yesterday before I had to bail out because of a little stomach bug that developed while I was on air.
[00:17:13.544 --> 00:17:16.528]  Certainly couldn't be here vomiting live.
[00:17:16.528 --> 00:17:19.271]  I'm always vomiting out information.
[00:17:19.271 --> 00:17:22.656]  Pun intended, but had to bail out yesterday.
[00:17:22.656 --> 00:17:23.296]  So I want to
[00:17:24.386 --> 00:17:26.608]  Come back where we left off with your phone calls.
[00:17:26.608 --> 00:17:30.231]  We'll be taking your phone calls throughout the broadcast today.
[00:17:30.231 --> 00:17:31.832]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:17:31.832 --> 00:17:31.932]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:17:31.932 --> 00:17:38.677]  And I'd love to hear from folks if you can get through from the Middle East on what you're seeing happen there, Saudi Arabia, Yemen.
[00:17:48.304 --> 00:17:54.589]  Egypt, Libya, of course they've cut most of the phone lines there, 800-259-9031.
[00:17:54.589 --> 00:18:01.253]  What do you think of these open announcements of ending the dollar as the world reserve currency?
[00:18:01.253 --> 00:18:05.056]  I mean, now it's not a question of if, but when.
[00:18:05.056 --> 00:18:06.477]  What are you doing to get prepared?
[00:18:06.477 --> 00:18:07.638]  Are you warning other people?
[00:18:07.638 --> 00:18:09.679]  Are your neighbors concerned about this?
[00:18:09.679 --> 00:18:14.423]  Or are they only concerned with Justin Bieber, the Charlie Sheen scandal?
[00:18:15.263 --> 00:18:22.806]  Uh, and all the rest of the things that are happening that the media, uh, basically uses as a distraction and an overall, uh, diversion.
[00:18:22.806 --> 00:18:31.689]  And if you're saying, well, Alex, you're being a hypocrite, you always criticize all this obsession with Hollywood and stuff, but then you triggered all of this with Charlie last week.
[00:18:31.689 --> 00:18:32.890]  I was, wasn't expecting that.
[00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:41.140]  But if we can use all of this hype to get people to look at real information, which is happening, then God turns it into something good.
[00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:45.346]  Charlie's just my friend who has changed a lot after a seven-month jag.
[00:18:46.564 --> 00:18:46.904]  I don't
[00:19:12.348 --> 00:19:23.957]  Stone and as I mentioned in the first little five-minute segment Coming up at the bottom of the last hour coming up at about two hours and 15 minutes from now I will say a little bit about Charlie.
[00:19:23.957 --> 00:19:39.509]  I had about an hour and a half discussion with him We've been talking every day since last week But I had a long hour and a half discussion and really know a lot of the things behind the scenes that are going on I'm not going to get into any of that because that's private But I can talk about a few things that are public and I can tell you what's real or what isn't
[00:19:40.129 --> 00:19:41.630]  Uh, out there.
[00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:43.971]  Obviously, a lot of folks are asking us about that.
[00:19:43.971 --> 00:19:46.312]  And it is now bound to this show, what we're doing.
[00:19:46.312 --> 00:19:50.974]  Uh, and so, uh, I think it is proper to talk a little bit about it.
[00:19:50.974 --> 00:19:55.636]  Also, Howard Stern has been attacking me almost on a daily basis.
[00:19:55.636 --> 00:19:57.197]  And people are like, well, why are you talking about Howard Stern?
[00:19:57.197 --> 00:19:58.818]  Well, now his listeners are learning about this show.
[00:20:00.774 --> 00:20:03.356]  Never buy home canning jar lids again!
[00:20:03.356 --> 00:20:04.036]  No kidding!

[00:20:43.283 --> 00:20:44.323]  The original since 1976.
[00:21:00.307 --> 00:21:02.690]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:05.013]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:21:05.013 --> 00:21:08.237]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:21:08.237 --> 00:21:13.323]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:21:13.323 --> 00:21:17.528]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:21:17.828 --> 00:21:20.171]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:21:20.171 --> 00:21:23.075]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:21:23.075 --> 00:21:25.979]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:21:25.979 --> 00:21:33.589]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:21:33.908 --> 00:21:39.293]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:21:39.293 --> 00:21:41.636]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:21:41.636 --> 00:21:45.860]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:46.921]  And I got news for you.
[00:21:46.921 --> 00:21:48.262]  You're everyone else.

[00:22:34.778 --> 00:22:40.582]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.

[00:24:25.015 --> 00:24:33.045]  After I take phone calls, I'm going to get back into why the dollar's reign is near an end here in the Wall Street Journal.
[00:24:33.045 --> 00:24:39.293]  Time Magazine coming out and saying, are America's good days behind us now?
[00:24:40.436 --> 00:24:42.997]  Why are they now admitting what they're doing?
[00:24:42.997 --> 00:25:03.426]  I wanna go over their whole plan, why they're doing this, and hopefully talk to you, the listeners, about rallying the population of this country around the fact that the private Federal Reserve is completely criminal, and is predatory, and is the main author of this designed implosion that is now taking place.
[00:25:03.426 --> 00:25:05.547]  This is such a big deal.
[00:25:05.547 --> 00:25:08.389]  Now, in a separate issue,
[00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:12.734]  I mentioned earlier, Howard Stern's been putting tweets out.
[00:25:12.734 --> 00:25:16.217]  I don't listen to his show very often, even though I have it on XM.
[00:25:16.217 --> 00:25:21.383]  I haven't heard it myself, but Jason Burmiss and others have heard it and told us about it.
[00:25:21.383 --> 00:25:25.188]  He's doing silly things like saying I've got a bad toupee.
[00:25:25.188 --> 00:25:27.070]  If it was a toupee, it would be bad.
[00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:28.492]  No, this is my hair, folks.
[00:25:28.492 --> 00:25:30.033]  It's falling out, and I don't care.
[00:25:31.154 --> 00:25:34.275]  But there's no toupee on earth looks like this.
[00:25:34.275 --> 00:25:35.215]  This is my hair.
[00:25:35.215 --> 00:25:43.617]  But it just shows the infantile nature of what America is basically fed through people like Howard Stern.
[00:25:43.617 --> 00:25:49.158]  He said, never heard of Alex Jones, but listening to Charlie's interview, I'm pretty sure Alex is wackier than Charlie.
[00:25:49.158 --> 00:25:50.178]  Outstanding.
[00:25:50.178 --> 00:25:51.418]  He tweeted that.
[00:25:51.418 --> 00:25:59.400]  He also put out in a tweet, last year, Jones predicted a coming race war in America to be brought on by the release of Robert Rodriguez's machete.
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:00.040]  It didn't happen.
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:03.761]  And that's the kind of things that he's putting out.
[00:26:03.761 --> 00:26:06.203]  Really, it didn't happen.
[00:26:06.203 --> 00:26:08.404]  Westlake Unrest dubbed L.A.
[00:26:08.404 --> 00:26:13.186]  machete riots by Immigration Restriction Group.
[00:26:13.186 --> 00:26:22.570]  And a lot of publications did report, and there was a Google map of it, six different riots, including multiple events with men wielding machetes.
[00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:28.013]  One of them had to be shot and killed by police the weekend that it was released.
[00:26:29.585 --> 00:26:39.915]  What I said was, if Robert Rodriguez didn't cut some of the things he had in that film out, it could cause racial tension that could lead to a race war.
[00:26:39.915 --> 00:26:47.362]  We've already seen the illegal aliens pulling down American flags in Texas, Arizona, in Florida, and in California.
[00:26:47.362 --> 00:26:51.245]  If kids wear American flags to school, that's MSNBC Associated Press.
[00:26:51.946 --> 00:27:01.589]  They're told take them off because it enrages the illegal aliens so much who are wearing their Mexican flags and taking down the school's flag and running up the Mexican flag.
[00:27:01.589 --> 00:27:06.471]  You know, my issue is Mexico's a country that lost wars with us.
[00:27:06.471 --> 00:27:20.735]  Mexico teaches its school children that the Southwest was wrongfully taken in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and that if the people coming here wanted to get into liberty and the Second Amendment and free speech, I'd be all for it.
[00:27:21.795 --> 00:27:22.937]  But they don't.
[00:27:22.937 --> 00:27:27.324]  They come from a country that has an incredible history of tyranny and corruption.
[00:27:27.324 --> 00:27:28.887]  And no one can deny that.
[00:27:28.887 --> 00:27:33.915]  And Rodriguez came out in the press, in the Austin American-Statesman, and ain't it cool news?
[00:27:34.941 --> 00:27:41.626]  And said that I wasn't telling the truth and I didn't have the script, even though I got it directly from inside his operation.
[00:27:41.626 --> 00:27:49.191]  When the movie came out, it was word for word the script, except for two or three scenes they cut that were the scenes we recommended they cut.
[00:27:49.191 --> 00:27:55.216]  But it was still all about a race war, and it was the equivalent of a Hispanic birth of a nation.
[00:27:55.939 --> 00:27:59.843]  Of course, that was the Ku Klux Klan movie promoting race war.
[00:27:59.843 --> 00:28:06.209]  So, I was proven right, but the media, you know, says there's no world government forming as it's forming.
[00:28:07.062 --> 00:28:09.783]  They say fluoride in the water isn't bad for you.
[00:28:09.783 --> 00:28:12.025]  They say flu shots aren't bad for you and that we're wrong.
[00:28:12.025 --> 00:28:14.186]  No, we're right.
[00:28:14.186 --> 00:28:24.491]  And so the film did cause, was linked to some rioting and someone being shot who was wielding a machete.
[00:28:24.491 --> 00:28:27.733]  There's no doubt that that's basically what happened here.
[00:28:27.733 --> 00:28:30.414]  But my point was we had the script and he said we didn't.
[00:28:30.894 --> 00:28:32.415]  And said that we were making stuff up.
[00:28:32.415 --> 00:28:38.178]  Later, he told Ain't It Cool News, yeah, I may have had too much tequila when I wrote the script.
[00:28:38.178 --> 00:28:39.739]  So he contradicted himself.
[00:28:39.739 --> 00:28:43.081]  And I am going to cut some scenes that will only be on the DVD.
[00:28:43.081 --> 00:28:44.022]  I went a little too far.
[00:28:45.023 --> 00:28:47.084]  So we told the truth.
[00:28:47.084 --> 00:28:49.705]  They cut the really incendiary stuff out.
[00:28:49.705 --> 00:28:53.226]  I mean, they had the gringos crucifying the Catholic priest.
[00:28:53.226 --> 00:29:02.929]  They had the cowboy hat wearing rednecks, Robert De Niro and Don Johnson, little Hispanic women who are pregnant, begging, don't kill my baby.
[00:29:02.929 --> 00:29:05.910]  And then they shoot the woman in the stomach who's pregnant and make fun of.
[00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:09.773]  You know, dead babies and Hispanics.
[00:29:09.773 --> 00:29:12.995]  I mean, it was total race-baiting division.
[00:29:12.995 --> 00:29:15.818]  Because the globalists don't want us coming together.
[00:29:15.818 --> 00:29:19.661]  Liberal, conservative, black, white, Hispanic against the TSA.
[00:29:19.661 --> 00:29:21.403]  Against the warrantless wiretapping.
[00:29:21.403 --> 00:29:22.484]  Against the illegal wars.
[00:29:23.024 --> 00:29:25.125]  They don't want us coming together against the New World Order.
[00:29:25.125 --> 00:29:31.549]  The Ford Foundation that funds the big universities and all this racial division and liberation theology wants this.
[00:29:31.549 --> 00:29:33.571]  And that's what happened with Rodriguez.
[00:29:33.571 --> 00:29:35.212]  And I know people that know him here in town.
[00:29:35.212 --> 00:29:37.533]  He's into Larry Conquista.
[00:29:37.533 --> 00:29:41.476]  I was told he didn't like me a decade ago when his wife gave him my films.
[00:29:41.476 --> 00:29:44.077]  He said, well, that guy's not for Milo Raza.
[00:29:44.077 --> 00:29:45.678]  And so it is what it is.
[00:29:45.678 --> 00:29:46.739]  And I'm right.
[00:29:46.739 --> 00:29:48.300]  And Howard Stern is wrong.
[00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:49.161]  But I mean, give me a break.
[00:29:50.626 --> 00:29:54.548]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.548 --> 00:30:00.390]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:02.031]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:02.031 --> 00:30:05.412]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.

[00:30:24.364 --> 00:30:30.871]  Since 1947, Calvin's Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.

[00:30:53.737 --> 00:30:54.178]  Thank you!
[00:30:59.909 --> 00:31:04.452]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:31:04.452 --> 00:31:05.372]  Number one.
[00:31:05.372 --> 00:31:08.795]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:31:08.795 --> 00:31:09.655]  Number two.
[00:31:09.655 --> 00:31:14.558]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:31:14.558 --> 00:31:15.299]  It's true.
[00:31:15.299 --> 00:31:20.162]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:31:20.162 --> 00:31:21.002]  Number three.
[00:31:21.002 --> 00:31:24.585]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:31:24.585 --> 00:31:28.287]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:31:28.487 --> 00:31:29.267]  Number 4.
[00:31:29.267 --> 00:31:32.028]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:31:32.028 --> 00:31:35.710]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:36.510]  Number 5.
[00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:40.652]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:31:40.652 --> 00:31:45.714]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:31:45.714 --> 00:31:49.875]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:49.875 --> 00:31:51.676]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:51.676 --> 00:31:56.278]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[00:32:00.019 --> 00:32:03.600]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:04.900]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:09.302]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:32:09.302 --> 00:32:15.244]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:32:15.244 --> 00:32:17.384]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:32:17.384 --> 00:32:20.065]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[00:32:20.425 --> 00:32:26.909]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[00:32:26.909 --> 00:32:29.130]  They both make fabulous investments.
[00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:34.474]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[00:32:34.474 --> 00:32:39.757]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[00:32:39.757 --> 00:32:44.920]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:48.301]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[00:32:48.301 --> 00:32:51.222]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[00:32:51.222 --> 00:32:52.162]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[00:32:52.162 --> 00:32:54.703]  You are listening to an Infowars.com Frontline Report.
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:25.928]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:25.928 --> 00:33:30.292]  This broadcast focuses on reality, what's happening in the world today.
[00:33:30.292 --> 00:33:38.318]  It's about not being a spectator who just accepts whatever is handed to them by the media and the government and the culture controllers.
[00:33:38.318 --> 00:33:44.443]  It's about the people getting involved fundamentally in understanding the dynamics that govern our planet.
[00:33:45.303 --> 00:33:51.850]  and trying to control our own destinies instead of handing our destiny over to others.
[00:33:51.850 --> 00:33:53.912]  It's about truly living.
[00:33:53.912 --> 00:33:56.294]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:33:56.294 --> 00:33:58.717]  Again, we're here Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[00:33:58.717 --> 00:33:59.177]  to 2 p.m.
[00:33:59.177 --> 00:34:03.401]  Central, back Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:34:03.401 --> 00:34:05.483]  Central Standard Time.
[00:34:05.483 --> 00:34:05.764]  Okay.
[00:34:07.328 --> 00:34:15.953]  The big news here, obviously, is that the situation is continuing to deteriorate in the Middle East and North Africa.
[00:34:15.953 --> 00:34:21.056]  And our inside sources called it, this was going to happen five months ago.
[00:34:21.056 --> 00:34:29.621]  We also have incredible announcements from the Wall Street Journal, why the dollar's reign is near an end.
[00:34:29.621 --> 00:34:36.065]  And they basically announced this situation and this earth-shattering development like it's no big deal.
[00:34:37.679 --> 00:34:41.801]  This will cause massive dollar devaluation.
[00:34:41.801 --> 00:34:50.887]  It will cause the dollar and the countries that hold trillions of dollars, like China, the Middle East, in the aggregate holds trillions.
[00:34:50.887 --> 00:34:53.068]  The European Union holds close to a trillion.
[00:34:53.068 --> 00:34:55.990]  It will cause those holdings to lose value.
[00:34:56.810 --> 00:35:01.652]  It will cause the value of the dollar to plunge, triggering massive inflation.
[00:35:01.652 --> 00:35:10.676]  It will decimate people on fixed incomes like Social Security, or people working near the poverty line, the working poor.
[00:35:10.676 --> 00:35:14.037]  All our country had left was the dollar.
[00:35:15.202 --> 00:35:21.046]  The industry's been shut down by the regulations and control and by the deals that have been signed with China.
[00:35:21.046 --> 00:35:23.268]  Globalism is a disease.
[00:35:23.268 --> 00:35:28.672]  It is a cancer designed to create a race to the bottom, a giant sucking sound.
[00:35:28.672 --> 00:35:32.835]  Remember 16, 17 years ago in 1994?
[00:35:32.835 --> 00:35:37.239]  We have clips of it in my film, Fall of the Republic, whenever
[00:35:39.232 --> 00:35:43.018]  Ross Perot went on television and said, this will drop wages.
[00:35:43.018 --> 00:35:46.102]  This will de-industrialize.
[00:35:46.102 --> 00:35:48.145]  This will hurt this country.
[00:35:49.042 --> 00:35:51.904]  He said, the next few decades it will destroy us.
[00:35:51.904 --> 00:35:54.225]  And the media laughed at him.
[00:35:54.225 --> 00:35:58.908]  And Al Gore got up there and said, this is a great deal, Larry.
[00:35:58.908 --> 00:36:02.531]  You need to be quiet, Ross Perot, and kept interrupting him.
[00:36:02.531 --> 00:36:05.192]  Oh, this is such a good deal.
[00:36:05.192 --> 00:36:08.274]  And you could just look at him and know from history he was lying.
[00:36:08.274 --> 00:36:11.536]  But also, not just intellectually, just watching him.
[00:36:11.536 --> 00:36:13.778]  He was enjoying conning people.
[00:36:14.463 --> 00:36:24.495]  And then he got together a few years later in 96 with Ken Lay at the White House with Enron and wrote up the carbon tax plan that we're now under.
[00:36:26.192 --> 00:36:36.141]  I mean, Al Gore is a criminal, is a treacherous, traitorous gangster, setting up scams to make you and your family poor and consolidate wealth.
[00:36:36.141 --> 00:36:38.023]  They want to post-industrial America.
[00:36:38.023 --> 00:36:40.325]  This is their goal.
[00:36:40.325 --> 00:36:41.506]  I want to know what you think about it.
[00:36:41.506 --> 00:36:41.846]  800-259-9231.
[00:36:41.846 --> 00:36:44.468]  Just briefly getting back to Machete.
[00:36:49.102 --> 00:36:59.213]  In Hollywood Reporter, they basically kicked off this narrative a few days ago, the man behind Charlie Sheen's rants meets syndicated radio host Alex Jones.
[00:36:59.213 --> 00:37:09.543]  And at the end of the article, as a way to discredit me, they say, last year Jones predicted a coming race war in America to be brought on by the release of Robert Rodriguez's machete.
[00:37:09.543 --> 00:37:10.144]  It didn't happen.
[00:37:11.598 --> 00:37:22.163]  Really, major newspapers reported on the six riots that happened in the two days after Machete was released in Southern California.
[00:37:22.163 --> 00:37:29.506]  In every case, knife and machete wielding people, including one person, having to be gunned down by police.
[00:37:29.506 --> 00:37:39.771]  And at the very same time, in the videos that they linked to in Hollywood Reporter to discredit me, I talked about beheadings happening in Arizona by the drug cartels.
[00:37:41.423 --> 00:37:48.706]  And how the script for Machete talked about ongoing beheadings with machetes.
[00:37:48.706 --> 00:37:52.468]  And I said this was certainly going to encourage this and increase it.
[00:37:52.468 --> 00:38:09.036]  Then when the movie came out, and there were a bunch of beheadings in California, in Arizona, and in South Texas, I was reading these out of major newspapers and watching it on local TV in different areas of the country, Arizona, Texas, California, a few other areas.
[00:38:10.237 --> 00:38:13.800]  And it was Mexican drug gangs chopping people's heads off.
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:17.643]  And there were news articles that came out at the time saying, Jones is lying.
[00:38:17.643 --> 00:38:20.645]  There's no beheadings going on.
[00:38:20.645 --> 00:38:22.486]  With machetes.
[00:38:22.486 --> 00:38:23.267]  I was like, excuse me?
[00:38:23.267 --> 00:38:25.148]  I have all the mainstream articles.
[00:38:25.148 --> 00:38:28.010]  They were counting on you being stupid.
[00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:31.113]  They were counting on you not going and researching and looking it up.
[00:38:33.246 --> 00:38:35.826]  So they're always announcing that we're wrong.
[00:38:35.826 --> 00:38:41.988]  They're always announcing that we've told people things that weren't true, twisting what we said.
[00:38:41.988 --> 00:38:50.429]  I said if he didn't cut the particularly race war invocations out of the film, that there was a very good chance it was going to trigger it.
[00:38:50.429 --> 00:38:52.449]  He did cut some of it out.
[00:38:52.449 --> 00:38:53.790]  But I had the exact script.
[00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:55.290]  I knew what areas were cut out.
[00:38:55.290 --> 00:38:57.350]  It was word for word, the exact script.
[00:38:57.350 --> 00:38:59.231]  They lied and said I didn't have the script.
[00:38:59.231 --> 00:39:00.391]  Well, I knew I had the script.
[00:39:01.408 --> 00:39:07.834]  It came from a major Hollywood manager.
[00:39:07.834 --> 00:39:10.477]  It also came out of an Austin office.
[00:39:10.477 --> 00:39:11.598]  I'm not going to say whose office.
[00:39:11.598 --> 00:39:13.159]  I think you can guess.
[00:39:13.159 --> 00:39:14.581]  Where's Rodriguez based?
[00:39:14.581 --> 00:39:22.428]  And then I also was sent a different version, but only slightly, of a rewrite from someone anonymously.
[00:39:22.428 --> 00:39:22.549]  Now,
[00:39:23.669 --> 00:39:28.592]  That said, every week or so, I see new beheading stories.
[00:39:28.592 --> 00:39:30.653]  Here's one today.
[00:39:30.653 --> 00:39:31.214]  Police.
[00:39:31.214 --> 00:39:35.116]  Arizona beheading tied to Mexican drug cartel.
[00:39:35.116 --> 00:39:37.097]  And this is Thursday, March 3rd, 2011.
[00:39:37.097 --> 00:39:38.798]  This is today.
[00:39:38.798 --> 00:39:42.941]  And sometimes I see these multiple times a week.
[00:39:42.941 --> 00:39:44.422]  Sometimes it takes a few weeks.
[00:39:44.422 --> 00:39:46.223]  And when I say I see it every week, I mean that's about
[00:39:47.136 --> 00:39:48.097]  How often do I see it?
[00:39:48.097 --> 00:39:50.078]  You may be seeing it more often.
[00:39:50.078 --> 00:40:02.367]  But authorities have determined a man who was stabbed and beheaded in a suburban Phoenix apartment was killed for stealing drugs from a Mexican cartel in a gruesome example of drug cartel violence spilling over the border.
[00:40:02.367 --> 00:40:08.332]  And he reportedly stole 400 pounds of marijuana and meth from a drug cartel and got his head chopped off.
[00:40:08.332 --> 00:40:09.853]  So there's... Oh, oh!
[00:40:09.853 --> 00:40:12.695]  By the way, it wasn't just me who got attacked.
[00:40:12.695 --> 00:40:15.497]  And they said I was making up beheadings all over the U.S.
[00:40:15.497 --> 00:40:16.218]  The governor
[00:40:17.045 --> 00:40:20.148]  When I talked about this on video, it got picked up in the news.
[00:40:20.148 --> 00:40:24.512]  The governor talked about beheadings in Arizona.
[00:40:24.512 --> 00:40:31.279]  Particularly when the coyotes catch people that didn't pay them to cross, they chopped their heads off.
[00:40:31.279 --> 00:40:37.004]  They found whole groups of people in Arizona, for years, with their heads chopped off.
[00:40:37.004 --> 00:40:39.727]  Women raped, and then they have their heads chopped off.
[00:40:39.727 --> 00:40:41.348]  Children having their heads chopped off.
[00:40:42.298 --> 00:40:46.984]  They find whole barns on the Mexican border with the U.S.
[00:40:46.984 --> 00:40:51.029]  in one case just a few months ago with hundreds of dead chopped up and shot.
[00:40:52.142 --> 00:40:56.064]  And what did the so-called liberal media do?
[00:40:56.064 --> 00:40:59.605]  They just came out and said, there's no heads being chopped off.
[00:40:59.605 --> 00:41:01.706]  The Arizona governor is a liar.
[00:41:01.706 --> 00:41:03.067]  Okay, she's a liar.
[00:41:03.067 --> 00:41:04.007]  All right.
[00:41:04.007 --> 00:41:07.068]  Here is the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
[00:41:07.068 --> 00:41:08.789]  They just reposted the Associated Press.
[00:41:08.789 --> 00:41:09.729]  It'll be technical.
[00:41:09.729 --> 00:41:12.591]  It's AP Amanda Lee Myers.
[00:41:12.591 --> 00:41:13.831]  Today.
[00:41:13.831 --> 00:41:14.871]  Another beheading.
[00:41:14.871 --> 00:41:15.672]  Doesn't exist.
[00:41:15.672 --> 00:41:15.952]  Okay.
[00:41:18.223 --> 00:41:33.132]  Now, speaking of that whole area of discussion, heads of U.S.-Mexico to meet as tensions rise, and they go on to report that Obama is discussing putting armed U.S.
[00:41:33.132 --> 00:41:35.554]  agents in Mexico.
[00:41:35.554 --> 00:41:38.596]  Guys, that was in my stack, but now I can't find it.
[00:41:38.596 --> 00:41:39.576]  Will you put it on screen?
[00:41:39.576 --> 00:41:41.257]  Obama discussing putting armed U.S.
[00:41:41.257 --> 00:41:42.558]  agents in Mexico?
[00:41:42.558 --> 00:41:44.079]  Thank you.
[00:41:44.079 --> 00:41:47.021]  Which is a horrible, horrible, horrible idea.
[00:41:48.988 --> 00:41:54.454]  They have had now in the last two years over 30,000 Mexicans killed in the drug war.
[00:41:54.454 --> 00:41:59.641]  Thousands of them are government officials and police and military.
[00:41:59.641 --> 00:42:04.527]  I mean, in one week they killed a few months ago, what was it, four mayors?
[00:42:04.527 --> 00:42:06.709]  Shot three of them, chopped the head off of another?
[00:42:07.816 --> 00:42:09.437]  Three or four or five.
[00:42:09.437 --> 00:42:10.177]  I can't even remember.
[00:42:10.177 --> 00:42:12.239]  I think it was, maybe it was five.
[00:42:12.239 --> 00:42:13.359]  There it is.
[00:42:13.359 --> 00:42:16.601]  AFP, Obama to discuss armed U.S.
[00:42:16.601 --> 00:42:17.442]  agents in Mexico.
[00:42:17.442 --> 00:42:19.803]  The United States will discuss the idea of U.S.
[00:42:19.803 --> 00:42:24.146]  armed agents operating inside Mexico, which is being rocked by deadly drug violence.
[00:42:24.146 --> 00:42:28.348]  When President Barack Obama meets his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calderon, a U.S.
[00:42:28.348 --> 00:42:32.231]  senior official said yesterday, Obama welcomes Calderon to the White House today.
[00:42:32.771 --> 00:42:34.412]  It's a top priority for the U.S.
[00:42:34.412 --> 00:42:41.774]  government to ensure the measures are being taken to protect our personnel, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
[00:42:41.774 --> 00:42:48.537]  Oh yeah, because we've had all those embassy workers shot, killed, stabbed, and beheaded.
[00:42:48.537 --> 00:42:50.077]  Oh, that's been happening too.
[00:42:50.077 --> 00:42:57.200]  But Howard Stern says it's not happening, so because he knows how to make flatulence jokes, it must be true.
[00:42:59.881 --> 00:43:02.702]  I mean, it's crazy.
[00:43:02.702 --> 00:43:12.428]  All these news articles I've seen since I exposed Machete almost a year ago now, or I don't know, nine, ten months ago, have been proven wrong.
[00:43:12.428 --> 00:43:14.889]  We've been proven right, but they don't care.
[00:43:14.889 --> 00:43:19.671]  They just declare that we've lost and hope that people aren't paying attention.
[00:43:19.671 --> 00:43:20.692]  They think you're stupid.
[00:43:21.604 --> 00:43:29.189]  Now continuing, heads of US-Mexico to meet as tensions rise, violence from drug war to top agenda as Calderon visits Obama today.
[00:43:29.189 --> 00:43:32.751]  Now, that's out of the Wall Street Journal.
[00:43:32.751 --> 00:43:46.119]  If they decriminalize cocaine and heroin and marijuana, which I'm not saying is good to use those things, in every study, in every European country that's done it, it doesn't mean you sell it to school kids.
[00:43:46.119 --> 00:43:47.580]  No, no.
[00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:48.321]  You control it.
[00:43:49.827 --> 00:43:53.729]  And on average, within about two years, drug use drops by half.
[00:43:53.729 --> 00:43:55.970]  It's no longer seen as sexy and cool.
[00:43:55.970 --> 00:43:58.230]  The money isn't involved in it.
[00:43:58.230 --> 00:44:03.533]  And so there aren't all the women and fast cars and mansions associated with it.
[00:44:03.533 --> 00:44:07.414]  Then young people can't be involved in it as a business.
[00:44:07.414 --> 00:44:19.079]  Addicts, crime always plunges again by around 50% on average, because if they can go to the corner clinic and get their heroin for free through a welfare program,
[00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:33.826]  Are they going to break into your house and steal your jewelry and computer and if they happen to catch you there, kill you because they need to get their fix by putting a needle in their arm?
[00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:40.722]  Is a crackhead gonna carjack you and your family because they gotta have crack?
[00:44:40.722 --> 00:44:49.486]  The crack zombies that we see running around on the streets of every major city with their hair falling out, looking like something out of Day of the Dead zombies.
[00:44:49.486 --> 00:44:54.569]  I remember growing up in Dallas as a teenager and just seeing the crack zombies.
[00:44:54.569 --> 00:44:56.730]  I mean, you'd see people who
[00:44:58.203 --> 00:45:03.495]  You'd see white people with their hair all falling out who had like green skin, sores all over their face.
[00:45:03.495 --> 00:45:08.305]  You would see black people so, so near the edge of death that they were white.
[00:45:09.892 --> 00:45:15.794]  I mean, they looked like they were dead, like all the blood was out of them, with their hair falling out, no teeth.
[00:45:15.794 --> 00:45:27.538]  They come up to your car window, and a woman with no teeth, with drool running out of her mouth, and what looked like sores all over, who looked like she weighed about 80 pounds, would say, baby, let me in the car, I'll do all this for $5.
[00:45:30.632 --> 00:45:36.340]  And then you hurriedly wait for the red light to change so you can speed away.
[00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:39.444]  That would all end if you decriminalized it.
[00:45:39.444 --> 00:45:43.870]  And the crime, and the murders, and the corruption, it's a fact.
[00:45:44.753 --> 00:45:46.094]  It's a fact.
[00:45:46.094 --> 00:45:49.535]  Oh, but we have the biggest drug war in the world.
[00:45:49.535 --> 00:45:52.697]  And our country roughly uses half of the illegal drugs in the world.
[00:45:52.697 --> 00:45:54.057]  What an incredible number.
[00:45:54.057 --> 00:45:55.378]  It corrupts the police.
[00:45:55.378 --> 00:45:57.319]  It corrupts the society.
[00:45:57.319 --> 00:45:58.900]  It corrupts our young people.
[00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:00.660]  It's seen as sexy and cool.
[00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:02.481]  Drugs aren't sexy.
[00:46:02.481 --> 00:46:03.682]  Drugs aren't cool.
[00:46:04.162 --> 00:46:05.283]  Don't use them.
[00:46:05.283 --> 00:46:06.004]  Don't take them.
[00:46:06.004 --> 00:46:07.725]  Don't ever start.
[00:46:07.725 --> 00:46:09.647]  Don't ever put that chewing tobacco in your mouth.
[00:46:09.647 --> 00:46:11.768]  Don't ever smoke a cigarette.
[00:46:11.768 --> 00:46:13.370]  It'll take 30 years off your life.
[00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:14.050]  It's addictive.
[00:46:14.050 --> 00:46:15.131]  It's hard to beat.
[00:46:15.131 --> 00:46:17.573]  Don't ever take cocaine.
[00:46:17.573 --> 00:46:20.055]  Don't ever take opiates.
[00:46:20.055 --> 00:46:25.059]  If you have your back hurt in a car wreck, tough it out without painkillers.
[00:46:25.059 --> 00:46:27.141]  I'm telling you, you do not want to get addicted.
[00:46:33.356 --> 00:46:34.878]  There is so much going on.
[00:46:34.878 --> 00:46:37.201]  There is so much happening here.
[00:46:37.201 --> 00:46:41.167]  And so, let me give you the larger situation, and then we'll go to your phone calls.
[00:46:41.167 --> 00:46:47.055]  And then coming up at the bottom of the hour, next hour, we got popping in from Cairo, Egypt, Max Keiser.
[00:46:48.251 --> 00:47:01.342]  In the SPP documents that Judicial Watch student got, and I talk about these so much, just like I talk about Governor Ridge eight and a half years ago in a two hour C-SPAN I watched, saying you're gonna have to have a TSA card to have a job.
[00:47:01.342 --> 00:47:04.264]  There's gonna be TSA checkpoints on every road.
[00:47:04.264 --> 00:47:12.111]  Local police will be TSA, Homeland Security, DHS certified.
[00:47:12.111 --> 00:47:15.994]  Now, here we are almost nine years later and that's all being rolled out.
[00:47:17.267 --> 00:47:19.529]  It took them that long to get it ready.
[00:47:19.529 --> 00:47:32.319]  There are certain key globalist events that we either sue and get the documents or they go ahead and think nobody's watching and talk about it on C-SPAN that give you total blueprint.
[00:47:32.319 --> 00:47:34.400]  It's like getting the enemy battle plans.
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:39.845]  And so there are dozens and dozens and dozens of things I harp on because there's such
[00:47:42.079 --> 00:47:49.862]  Key information, their manifestos, their blueprints, their battle plans, their programs.
[00:47:49.862 --> 00:47:55.684]  Now, Judicial Watch sued for over a year, got the 1996 Banff Canada SPP meetings.
[00:47:57.145 --> 00:48:08.490]  Nothing in the year and a half previous to that, when Bush signed the SPP secretly with Vicente Fox and also the Canadian Prime Minister in Waco, Texas, no one had ever gotten the info.
[00:48:08.490 --> 00:48:12.832]  It was a secret agreement, secret treaty, high treason on its face.
[00:48:12.832 --> 00:48:18.294]  Even World Net Daily's experts wrote that it's treason to have the President signing secret treaties.
[00:48:18.294 --> 00:48:19.714]  He doesn't even have that power.
[00:48:19.714 --> 00:48:20.815]  The Senate has to ratify it.
[00:48:21.681 --> 00:48:22.822]  But they don't care.
[00:48:22.822 --> 00:48:25.025]  They controlled the bureaucracy.
[00:48:25.025 --> 00:48:34.134]  Now, Judicial Watch was able to sue over and over again and got thousands of pages of it and published much of it at Judicial Watch website.
[00:48:34.134 --> 00:48:36.837]  In fact, I want to get Judicial Watch back on about that.
[00:48:36.837 --> 00:48:38.318]  And what did it say?
[00:48:38.318 --> 00:48:39.660]  They got it in 2007.
[00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:40.961]  I put it in the endgame.
[00:48:40.961 --> 00:48:43.584]  Blueprint for Global Enslavement covers the key areas.
[00:48:43.584 --> 00:48:44.285]  Shows the documents.
[00:48:45.831 --> 00:48:47.151]  They have the meeting.
[00:48:47.151 --> 00:48:50.412]  The first thing they say is this is integration of North America by stealth.
[00:48:50.412 --> 00:48:56.694]  This plan only can succeed with all of you keeping this secret, including members of the press.
[00:48:56.694 --> 00:49:00.355]  We have the minutes of it.
[00:49:00.355 --> 00:49:03.696]  It's linked on whatistheendgame.com in the bibliography on the website.
[00:49:04.957 --> 00:49:06.298]  This is so important, folks.
[00:49:06.298 --> 00:49:07.739]  Look at what we have.
[00:49:07.739 --> 00:49:09.441]  And they said, we're going to use crises.
[00:49:09.441 --> 00:49:12.703]  We're going to use biological threats like the flu.
[00:49:12.703 --> 00:49:15.245]  We're going to use economic collapse.
[00:49:15.245 --> 00:49:20.049]  And we're going to use the drug war as a pretext to use Mexican and Canadian troops in the U.S.
[00:49:20.049 --> 00:49:22.271]  and vice versa with both other countries.
[00:49:23.715 --> 00:49:25.637]  What was in the news last week?
[00:49:25.637 --> 00:49:28.979]  Oh, Obama signs North American security perimeter.
[00:49:28.979 --> 00:49:30.801]  That's in the SPP documents.
[00:49:30.801 --> 00:49:38.827]  From Alaska, as we say in Endgame, four years ago, from Alaska down to the Mexican border with Guatemala.
[00:49:38.827 --> 00:49:41.350]  You understand how key this is?
[00:49:41.350 --> 00:49:46.434]  They went on and said, we're going to use the drug war threat and the violence that will increase.
[00:49:46.434 --> 00:49:51.178]  They knew when they were about to put Calderon in to declare war on the drug cartels, they didn't control if this would happen.
[00:49:51.974 --> 00:49:55.636]  They create the crisis, just like they start the revolutions in the Middle East.
[00:49:55.636 --> 00:49:58.378]  Doesn't mean they control them, they can start them.
[00:49:58.378 --> 00:50:03.641]  It's easy to set a house on fire, and then show up later saying you're the fire department.
[00:50:03.641 --> 00:50:05.542]  That's what the globalists do.
[00:50:05.542 --> 00:50:14.927]  And so they said, we're gonna use the drug war crisis, the flu crisis, and the terror threat, and also economic threat, those four things, to do this.
[00:50:14.927 --> 00:50:16.588]  And what did you see in the Ottawa Citizen?
[00:50:16.588 --> 00:50:18.289]  And let's put it on screen, we come back from break if we can.
[00:50:21.681 --> 00:50:26.625]  Mexican and American troops to be used in Canada, vice versa.
[00:50:26.625 --> 00:50:29.327]  Foreign troops to be in each other's countries.
[00:50:29.327 --> 00:50:31.689]  I forget the exact headline.
[00:50:31.689 --> 00:50:33.931]  Well, that was already going on in drills.
[00:50:33.931 --> 00:50:36.753]  And people are like, oh, they're not going to have Canadian and Mexican troops here.
[00:50:36.753 --> 00:50:38.875]  And I'm like, well, here's all the SPP documents.
[00:50:38.875 --> 00:50:40.176]  Here's drills they did.
[00:50:40.176 --> 00:50:40.716]  Got U.S.
[00:50:40.716 --> 00:50:43.339]  troops up there last year for the Olympics.
[00:50:43.339 --> 00:50:43.999]  Vice versa.
[00:50:43.999 --> 00:50:45.580]  Here's NLE09.
[00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:46.961]  FEMA put this out in a press release.
[00:50:47.762 --> 00:50:48.963]  Now they just announced it.
[00:50:48.963 --> 00:51:00.592]  So they're using all this drug war stuff to not just merge the countries by stealth to the bureaucracies, but also now announce gun control in the U.S., harmonizing our laws in Mexico.
[00:51:00.592 --> 00:51:05.135]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:51:05.135 --> 00:51:05.716]  Number one.
[00:51:06.036 --> 00:51:10.319]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:51:10.319 --> 00:51:15.203]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:51:15.203 --> 00:51:15.963]  It's true.
[00:51:15.963 --> 00:51:21.668]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:51:21.668 --> 00:51:25.250]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:51:25.250 --> 00:51:28.953]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:51:29.153 --> 00:51:29.934]  Number 4.
[00:51:29.934 --> 00:51:32.696]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:51:32.696 --> 00:51:36.378]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:51:36.378 --> 00:51:37.179]  Number 5.
[00:51:37.179 --> 00:51:41.322]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:51:41.322 --> 00:51:46.085]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:51:46.365 --> 00:51:50.550]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:51:50.550 --> 00:51:52.332]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:51:52.332 --> 00:51:54.575]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:51:54.575 --> 00:51:56.918]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:52:01.559 --> 00:52:05.563]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:52:05.563 --> 00:52:08.827]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:52:08.827 --> 00:52:13.612]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:13.612 --> 00:52:20.019]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:20.019 --> 00:52:22.241]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:52:22.762 --> 00:52:23.082]  Tim Geithner?
[00:52:23.082 --> 00:52:23.342]  Bernanke?
[00:52:23.342 --> 00:52:23.902]  They're arsonists!
[00:52:23.902 --> 00:52:24.923]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:24.923 --> 00:52:27.044]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:46.054]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[00:52:46.054 --> 00:52:48.957]  we have seen a fall of the republic.

[00:54:05.458 --> 00:54:11.524]  So the globalists told us in their own SPP documents that they didn't want us to see how things really work.
[00:54:12.711 --> 00:54:37.577]  And there were a little over a hundred corporate CEOs from all over the world at that Banff Canada three-day meeting, at that resort, shut down, basically a Bilderberg Group-type meeting, and they had big working groups, and the CEOs then gave orders to the heads of the federal bureaucracies of Canada, Mexico, and the U.S., and then you could see everything in that document then being implemented.
[00:54:37.577 --> 00:54:39.938]  By stealth, this is corporate government.
[00:54:40.942 --> 00:54:54.792]  And when I flew up to New York last week, Sunday, I was on the plane with a major banking CEO, and he just basically tried to sell me on we need a corporate government running America.
[00:54:54.792 --> 00:54:57.394]  You mean the ones that create the derivatives and rob everybody?
[00:54:57.394 --> 00:54:58.675]  The ones that want to take our guns?
[00:54:58.675 --> 00:55:00.656]  The ones that are for one-child policies?
[00:55:00.656 --> 00:55:05.319]  You mean you guys should run things?
[00:55:05.319 --> 00:55:08.722]  It was almost like the speech Howard Beale gets that we played last week.
[00:55:10.503 --> 00:55:15.072]  When he says you've meddled with the tidal forges of nature, Mr. Beale, and you will atone!
[00:55:15.072 --> 00:55:16.895]  Am I getting through to you, Mr. Beale?
[00:55:20.561 --> 00:55:30.945]  And I'm watching their battle plan, I'm watching everything they do, and they're down there in Mexico trying to mop up drug cartels that they didn't control with the 500 billion coming into the U.S.
[00:55:30.945 --> 00:55:33.426]  They control most of them, and that's all this is.
[00:55:33.426 --> 00:55:47.211]  And now when it spills over here, they're gonna use it, and the Attorney General's saying to try to ban assault weapons and restrict gun purchases to one at a time, all because they have a gun ban in Mexico and the people are living in a nightmare.
[00:55:47.951 --> 00:55:51.455]  And we have to basically harmonize our laws with Mexico.
[00:55:51.455 --> 00:55:53.317]  It's incredible.
[00:55:53.317 --> 00:55:56.140]  And it's all over the news today.
[00:55:56.140 --> 00:56:04.970]  The good news is, though, a whole bunch of states, including Texas, are mulling Arizona-style illegal immigration law.
[00:56:06.148 --> 00:56:13.757]  I almost called Paul Watson this morning to have him write a blurb or an article saying, Texas mulls Mexican-style immigration law.
[00:56:13.757 --> 00:56:20.264]  It's always, how horrible if somebody's here illegally and they get caught doing another crime, they might get deported.
[00:56:20.264 --> 00:56:21.405]  Oh, it's so terrible.
[00:56:21.405 --> 00:56:24.408]  Mexico has some of the most draconian immigration laws in the world.
[00:56:25.319 --> 00:56:26.860]  This is mainstream news.
[00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:27.921]  Mexico admits it.
[00:56:27.921 --> 00:56:34.066]  They put people for at least a year in a forced labor camp if they're caught from Latin America coming into Mexico.
[00:56:34.066 --> 00:56:35.427]  I'm not saying do that.
[00:56:35.427 --> 00:56:41.452]  I'm just saying deport illegal aliens, especially if they're running around waving their foreign countries' flags saying down with America.
[00:56:42.626 --> 00:56:43.628]  I mean, get out of here.
[00:56:43.628 --> 00:56:46.832]  You have to pledge that you want to be a U.S.
[00:56:46.832 --> 00:56:51.659]  citizen and that you'll follow the Bill of Rights and Constitution and take that oath to become a citizen.
[00:56:51.659 --> 00:56:52.260]  I don't have to.
[00:56:52.260 --> 00:56:53.502]  I was born here.
[00:56:53.502 --> 00:56:58.228]  But the point is, if you declare yourself as an America hater, get out of here.
[00:56:59.150 --> 00:57:05.338]  Okay, but this is all, oh my gosh, Texas might try to have an Arizona-style immigration law.
[00:57:05.338 --> 00:57:08.682]  You mean not have sanctuary cities where the illegal aliens are above the law?
[00:57:08.682 --> 00:57:10.405]  Oh my goodness, that would be terrible.
[00:57:10.405 --> 00:57:14.189]  But the real headline should be here, Texas moles
[00:57:16.030 --> 00:57:17.432]  Mexican immigration law.
[00:57:17.432 --> 00:57:20.456]  But then it would say, well, not actually.
[00:57:20.456 --> 00:57:23.700]  We're not going to put people in forced labor camps and we'll have links to all that.
[00:57:23.700 --> 00:57:27.665]  We're not going to beat them up and suck money out of them and treat them like Mexico does.
[00:57:27.665 --> 00:57:33.372]  No, Texas is mulling the moderate Arizona law.
[00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:41.291]  See, but that's how the media creates all this emotion and says, if you've got brown skin, you're gonna get arrested and put in a camp.
[00:57:41.291 --> 00:57:43.073]  Oh, sure you are.
[00:57:43.073 --> 00:57:45.918]  What, half the country has brown skin?
[00:57:45.918 --> 00:57:48.682]  The white people are all out suntanning trying to have brown skin?
[00:57:49.574 --> 00:57:51.797]  I mean, nobody cares.
[00:57:51.797 --> 00:57:56.842]  The media hypes all this race stuff to create the division, and I'm sick of it.
[00:57:56.842 --> 00:58:03.469]  I don't care what color you are, if you believe in private property, family, the Second Amendment, and sovereignty of this country.
[00:58:03.469 --> 00:58:06.953]  If you sign on to the Bill of Rights and realize how good it is and love it, I'm your friend.
[00:58:07.634 --> 00:58:18.359]  But you get so freaked out by an American flag that you send American school children, including Hispanics, home because it's like a vampire seeing a cross when you see an American flag.
[00:58:18.359 --> 00:58:19.539]  Get out of here!
[00:58:19.539 --> 00:58:20.800]  You're seditious.
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:22.420]  You're an enemy of this country.
[00:58:22.420 --> 00:58:23.661]  You've declared it.
[00:58:23.661 --> 00:58:25.342]  You see America as an enemy flag.
[00:58:26.311 --> 00:58:26.871]  Good.
[00:58:26.871 --> 00:58:27.512]  Get out of here.
[00:58:27.512 --> 00:58:29.833]  I'm not going to sit here and lick your boots.
[00:58:29.833 --> 00:58:32.195]  And that's the common sense analysis on that.
[00:58:32.195 --> 00:58:35.838]  We're going to be back in one minute with your phone calls and a ton of news.
[00:58:35.838 --> 00:58:43.063]  And Max Keiser coming up in 30 minutes from Cairo, Egypt.
[00:58:43.063 --> 00:58:46.525]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:46.525 --> 00:58:48.687]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.518 --> 00:58:51.679]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:58:51.679 --> 00:58:58.625]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:58:58.625 --> 00:59:01.167]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:59:01.167 --> 00:59:06.552]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:59:06.552 --> 00:59:09.594]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:59:09.594 --> 00:59:11.916]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:59:11.916 --> 00:59:17.801]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:59:18.061 --> 00:59:18.161]  Yes.
[00:59:18.161 --> 00:59:21.523]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:59:21.523 --> 00:59:27.307]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:59:27.307 --> 00:59:28.948]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:59:28.948 --> 00:59:30.248]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:59:30.248 --> 00:59:32.930]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:59:32.930 --> 00:59:34.331]  He explains everything you need to know.
[00:59:34.611 --> 00:59:37.132]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:59:37.132 --> 00:59:41.773]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:59:41.773 --> 00:59:44.354]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[00:59:53.377 --> 00:59:55.758]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.758 --> 00:59:58.539]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.117 --> 01:00:09.958]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.958 --> 01:00:11.538]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.538 --> 01:00:13.079]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.079 --> 01:00:17.279]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.279 --> 01:00:28.682]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.682 --> 01:00:30.462]  We are now into our number two.
[01:00:30.462 --> 01:00:31.842]  I've covered a host of key issues.
[01:00:31.842 --> 01:00:32.923]  I'll recap.
[01:00:32.923 --> 01:00:34.523]  Right now, we're going to go into your phone calls.
[01:00:36.004 --> 01:00:38.985]  Let's talk to Patience in Kansas.
[01:00:38.985 --> 01:00:39.666]  You're on the air.
[01:00:39.666 --> 01:00:41.887]  Welcome.
[01:00:41.887 --> 01:00:42.727]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:00:42.727 --> 01:00:46.889]  You know, I was listening in on what you're talking about, that Arizona law.
[01:00:46.889 --> 01:00:48.050]  Remember when Obama
[01:00:48.809 --> 01:00:55.932]  Came out and he said that that sounded racist and that was such a horrible law and the way that they were going about it and he was standing up against it.
[01:00:55.932 --> 01:01:11.119]  I don't know what his problem is with that because when Operation Phoenix came out in San Bernardino and cops from Fontana were allowed into San Bernardino along with a lot of other official figures that shouldn't have been there.
[01:01:11.119 --> 01:01:14.661]  They went door-to-door collecting kids for CPS at 4 o'clock in the morning and stuff.
[01:01:15.714 --> 01:01:19.958]  These cops from Fontana were running around calling little children the n-word.
[01:01:19.958 --> 01:01:21.759]  Okay?
[01:01:21.759 --> 01:01:30.306]  And apparently the mayor of that town, the founder of Operation Phoenix in San Bernardino, went and met with Joe Biden.
[01:01:31.269 --> 01:01:34.551]  Okay, and Joe Biden thinks that this Operation Phoenix thing is great.
[01:01:34.551 --> 01:01:35.131]  Oh, no, no, no.
[01:01:35.131 --> 01:01:45.077]  When the police go door-to-door in Boston and New York and Chicago for knock-and-talk and demand to be let in to, quote, look for illegal guns without warrants, that's great.
[01:01:45.077 --> 01:01:48.359]  When the government listens to you without warrants, that's great.
[01:01:48.359 --> 01:01:50.520]  When all of that's happening, it's wonderful.
[01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:58.484]  But, heaven forbid, if we've already arrested an illegal for committing a crime that, when we know they're illegal, we also charge them with that.
[01:01:58.484 --> 01:01:59.245]  Heaven forbid.
[01:02:00.779 --> 01:02:05.104]  Todd, I'm telling you, you combine that with SACWIS and we are in trouble.
[01:02:05.104 --> 01:02:07.627]  Seriously, I want to do a movie about SACWIS.
[01:02:07.627 --> 01:02:10.009]  Would you do a cameo in it, if I did?
[01:02:10.009 --> 01:02:11.711]  A movie about what?
[01:02:11.711 --> 01:02:14.955]  SACWIS, the State Automated Child Welfare Information System.
[01:02:14.955 --> 01:02:16.757]  I wrote the article for it, you put it on your site.
[01:02:17.028 --> 01:02:17.829]  No, I know.
[01:02:17.829 --> 01:02:19.430]  You called in last week about it.
[01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:29.919]  You know, I would love to make a million different movies, but for those that don't know, the state of California and others that's happening all over the country are creating basically licensing for children.
[01:02:29.919 --> 01:02:32.541]  I just think you should write more articles about it, and I wouldn't wait.
[01:02:32.541 --> 01:02:34.683]  I mean, just get up on YouTube yourself and talk about it.
[01:02:34.683 --> 01:02:41.008]  You know, folks always want to have some master stroke right up front, but it's best just to do what you can do now.
[01:02:41.008 --> 01:02:41.889]  I appreciate your call.
[01:02:41.889 --> 01:02:43.330]  Good to hear from you, Patience.
[01:02:43.330 --> 01:02:44.511]  George in Washington.
[01:02:44.511 --> 01:02:45.332]  George, you're on the air.
[01:02:49.005 --> 01:02:53.626]  Sounds like you're calling in, George, on an electric shaver.
[01:02:53.626 --> 01:02:56.227]  Is that a Norelco?
[01:02:56.227 --> 01:02:57.287]  There, I just said it.
[01:02:57.287 --> 01:02:58.608]  Norelco.
[01:02:58.608 --> 01:02:59.828]  Oh, your phone's better now, George.
[01:02:59.828 --> 01:03:00.528]  Go ahead.
[01:03:00.528 --> 01:03:01.929]  Yeah, it's the Morphic Field of Residence.
[01:03:01.929 --> 01:03:04.249]  I got the Grogby you got yesterday.
[01:03:04.249 --> 01:03:06.330]  I got it also, but I'm trying to fight through it.
[01:03:06.330 --> 01:03:10.671]  Okay, well, what's on your mind today, George?
[01:03:10.671 --> 01:03:11.191]  Oh, too much.
[01:03:11.191 --> 01:03:14.552]  You got an hour?
[01:03:14.552 --> 01:03:15.593]  What do you want to talk about?
[01:03:15.593 --> 01:03:17.053]  We could start... Okay, Bob Chapman.
[01:03:17.914 --> 01:03:18.094]  Hey Alex!
[01:03:43.402 --> 01:03:44.003]  Hey, what's up man?
[01:03:44.003 --> 01:03:48.170]  I'm going to keep it short and sweet because I know what a blessing it is to have this time with you here, man.
[01:03:48.170 --> 01:03:49.693]  A couple things.
[01:03:49.693 --> 01:03:56.584]  One, just like you and Lindsey Williams like to say, they like to put it right in front of our face, you know, what's going on.
[01:03:57.995 --> 01:04:00.197]  I'm not sure if you've ever heard of this man, but the Illuminati card game.
[01:04:00.197 --> 01:04:00.977]  You ever heard of that?
[01:04:00.977 --> 01:04:01.257]  I was.
[01:04:22.768 --> 01:04:23.068]  I think so.
[01:04:43.157 --> 01:04:45.599]  Man, you are doing such good work for us, man.
[01:04:45.599 --> 01:04:48.221]  As a country, as a people, man.
[01:04:48.221 --> 01:04:50.722]  I just want you to know that I'm praying for you.
[01:04:50.722 --> 01:04:53.904]  I'm sure that hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people are praying for you, man.
[01:04:53.904 --> 01:04:56.346]  You got some superhuman strength, man.
[01:04:56.346 --> 01:04:58.968]  You got some crazy power behind you.
[01:04:58.968 --> 01:05:00.109]  Well, God bless you, my friend.
[01:05:02.349 --> 01:05:06.330]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:06.330 --> 01:05:15.192]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:05:15.192 --> 01:05:19.813]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:05:19.813 --> 01:05:30.635]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:05:31.255 --> 01:05:40.778]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:40.778 --> 01:05:46.200]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:53.683]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:53.683 --> 01:05:56.104]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:06:01.630 --> 01:06:05.653]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:06:05.653 --> 01:06:08.896]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:06:08.896 --> 01:06:13.700]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:06:13.700 --> 01:06:20.085]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:06:20.085 --> 01:06:22.327]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:06:22.847 --> 01:06:23.167]  Tim Geithner?
[01:06:23.167 --> 01:06:23.668]  Bernanke?
[01:06:23.668 --> 01:06:24.348]  They're arsonists!
[01:06:24.348 --> 01:06:25.629]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:06:25.629 --> 01:06:27.871]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:06:41.761 --> 01:06:49.045]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:06:49.045 --> 01:06:58.149]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:07:00.134 --> 01:07:04.676]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:07:04.676 --> 01:07:05.597]  Number 1.
[01:07:05.597 --> 01:07:09.019]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:09.019 --> 01:07:09.879]  Number 2.
[01:07:09.879 --> 01:07:14.762]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:07:14.762 --> 01:07:15.502]  It's true.
[01:07:15.502 --> 01:07:20.385]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:07:20.385 --> 01:07:21.205]  Number 3.
[01:07:21.205 --> 01:07:24.787]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:07:24.787 --> 01:07:28.469]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:07:28.689 --> 01:07:29.490]  Number 4.
[01:07:29.490 --> 01:07:32.253]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:07:32.253 --> 01:07:35.937]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:07:35.937 --> 01:07:36.738]  Number 5.
[01:07:36.738 --> 01:07:40.883]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:07:40.883 --> 01:07:45.648]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:07:45.928 --> 01:07:50.091]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:50.091 --> 01:07:51.872]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:51.872 --> 01:07:54.134]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:07:54.134 --> 01:07:56.635]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:07:56.635 --> 01:07:57.956]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:07:57.956 --> 01:07:58.957]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:19.377 --> 01:08:23.699]  1-800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to join us.
[01:08:23.699 --> 01:08:25.019]  We're going right back to your calls.
[01:08:25.019 --> 01:08:32.502]  Max Keiser, TV presenter, a stock market expert, joining us from Cairo, Egypt, via video Skype on the roof of his hotel.
[01:08:32.502 --> 01:08:36.184]  It's an amazing shot we've got for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[01:08:36.184 --> 01:08:42.026]  If you're a member for radio listeners, you'll obviously get the audio, and then the video later will be all over the web for everybody.
[01:08:42.746 --> 01:08:52.350]  Of course, the big news here, recapping it, why the dollar's reign is near an end, that is the Wall Street Journal saying the dollar will die in the near future.
[01:08:52.350 --> 01:08:55.091]  But they talk about, oh, it might cause a few market disruptions.
[01:08:55.091 --> 01:08:57.752]  Yeah, like people on fixed incomes being in deep trouble.
[01:08:57.752 --> 01:09:00.013]  Massive dollar devaluation.
[01:09:00.013 --> 01:09:00.433]  The U.S.
[01:09:00.433 --> 01:09:03.755]  won't be able to buy foreign goods cheaply anymore.
[01:09:03.755 --> 01:09:08.556]  This is the equivalent of an economic Armageddon.
[01:09:08.556 --> 01:09:11.818]  Now, not on the horizon, but right down the street.
[01:09:12.928 --> 01:09:18.610]  And we're going to be going over that with Kaiser as well when he joins us.
[01:09:18.610 --> 01:09:27.013]  Also, I want to get into some of the other economic news that we are seeing here as well.
[01:09:27.013 --> 01:09:31.274]  Some of the new WikiLeaks information and huge new police state developments.
[01:09:31.274 --> 01:09:35.615]  But even Time Magazine says, are the good times over for America?
[01:09:35.615 --> 01:09:36.256]  That's one of the
[01:09:37.361 --> 01:09:40.703]  Other headlines that is out there.
[01:09:40.703 --> 01:09:43.144]  But right now, let's go ahead and go back to your calls.
[01:09:43.144 --> 01:09:45.565]  Bill in Connecticut, you're on the air.
[01:09:45.565 --> 01:09:46.666]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[01:09:46.666 --> 01:09:49.227]  I have just four quick bullet points.
[01:09:49.227 --> 01:09:52.949]  Number one, I don't know how anyone could question your credibility.
[01:09:52.949 --> 01:10:04.075]  When, on your program, when I began listening in October, when Lindsey William predicted the explosion, the Middle East exploding in exactly four months.
[01:10:04.075 --> 01:10:04.555]  Number two,
[01:10:06.229 --> 01:10:08.170]  You really shut those women down on The View.
[01:10:08.170 --> 01:10:14.032]  It's the first time that I've seen a guest come in and absolutely hammer the guest house.
[01:10:14.032 --> 01:10:15.853]  Oh, I can hammer anybody if it's live.
[01:10:15.853 --> 01:10:19.154]  I'd love to take down O'Reilly, but he's scared.
[01:10:19.154 --> 01:10:24.176]  Well, those women looked petrified when you were on, which was actually pretty funny.
[01:10:24.176 --> 01:10:35.841]  The third point, if you can talk to perhaps Ron Paul when he's on, you had made a cogent point about saying if the banks had paid all that money back, which they said they have,
[01:10:36.471 --> 01:10:40.958]  Wouldn't the debt be reduced by a commensurate amount?
[01:10:40.958 --> 01:10:44.303]  In other words, wouldn't it be down to 12 trillion instead of 14 trillion?
[01:10:44.303 --> 01:10:48.209]  Well, and that's only what's due now, and that's only federal.
[01:10:48.209 --> 01:10:49.251]  Look, here's what happened.
[01:10:50.259 --> 01:11:03.464]  They got three different, quote, bailouts that were really takeovers, and the media only focused on the $887 billion that the banks then got at zero interest and loaned out at 10, 20, 30.
[01:11:03.464 --> 01:11:14.369]  CNN reported, I didn't even know this, last month, in fact, let's pull it up for folks, they won't believe it, cnn.com, and then put in after it, credit card rates now at 59.9.
[01:11:18.087 --> 01:11:31.498]  So imagine, they get free money at zero, they loan it out at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, almost 60%, depending on who, as people go into debt, and then they paid some of that money back.
[01:11:31.498 --> 01:11:35.882]  But it wasn't talking about the open window, the Federal Reserve creating tens of trillions.
[01:11:35.882 --> 01:11:40.746]  Bloomberg reported over a year ago it was 23.7, then another four plus trillions, that's 28 trillion.
[01:11:40.746 --> 01:11:44.609]  They weren't counting all the secret loans or the secret money transfers.
[01:11:45.429 --> 01:11:54.256]  To things like MSNBC and hundreds of other US corporations so the media did a straw man or Lying by omission.
[01:11:54.256 --> 01:12:07.805]  They only focused on one area, but that 887 billion We now learned about a year after so now two years into it We're three years into it total, but about a year into it year and a half into it we learned that
[01:12:09.008 --> 01:12:10.448]  Folks, you can look all this up what I'm saying.
[01:12:10.448 --> 01:12:11.549]  This is fact.
[01:12:11.549 --> 01:12:15.990]  That, oh, that $887 billion was a revolving door of credit.
[01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:19.532]  They were doing it over and over again every few months.
[01:12:19.532 --> 01:12:26.434]  Now, you see the headlines a month ago out of Davos, Switzerland, at the Davos Public Bilderberg Group meeting.
[01:12:27.563 --> 01:12:30.784]  Oh, I'm sorry, let me apologize.
[01:12:30.784 --> 01:12:34.485]  I saw an earlier CNN that said 69.
[01:12:34.485 --> 01:12:38.606]  I'm sorry, my credit card had 79.9 APR.
[01:12:38.606 --> 01:12:41.627]  So, some people are getting 79.9.
[01:12:41.627 --> 01:12:45.148]  Loan sharking is 30%.
[01:12:45.148 --> 01:12:50.589]  But going back to Davos, in fact, we'll put that headline up, people won't believe it.
[01:12:50.589 --> 01:12:51.909]  Davos wants 100 trillion
[01:12:54.986 --> 01:12:55.486]  In addition
[01:13:16.477 --> 01:13:22.641]  Publicly, they're talking about $100 trillion, and we're having debates about banks giving back loans of a few hundred billion.
[01:13:22.641 --> 01:13:24.222]  There's the London Telegraph headline.
[01:13:24.222 --> 01:13:28.365]  World needs $100 trillion more credit, says World Economic Forum.
[01:13:28.365 --> 01:13:31.007]  Sorry, any other comments, sir?
[01:13:31.007 --> 01:13:33.008]  Well, just two more comments.
[01:13:33.008 --> 01:13:36.831]  But when you say $100 trillion, is that coming out of
[01:13:37.418 --> 01:13:39.079]  The American taxpayer's pocket?
[01:13:39.079 --> 01:13:39.659]  Absolutely.
[01:13:39.659 --> 01:13:41.319]  Do you want me to explain how it works?
[01:13:41.319 --> 01:13:42.379]  Yeah, I would.
[01:13:42.379 --> 01:13:50.462]  Okay, they have all of the major Western nations, Australia, Canada, Germany, France, the EU, England, the U.S.
[01:13:50.462 --> 01:13:54.343]  We contribute the seed money.
[01:13:54.343 --> 01:13:55.443]  So say the U.S.
[01:13:55.443 --> 01:13:58.804]  pumps a hundred billion, and that's a public number.
[01:13:58.804 --> 01:14:01.805]  Then we find out about hundreds of billions more in secret.
[01:14:01.805 --> 01:14:03.846]  They then leverage it
[01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:10.064]  But since 1999, they don't have Glass-Steagall anymore, so before they had the rule of about one to ten.
[01:14:10.064 --> 01:14:17.368]  For every one dollar you put in a bank, the bank, not just the bigger Federal Reserve banks, can loan out ten more dollars.
[01:14:17.368 --> 01:14:18.729]  You put a thousand in, ten thousand.
[01:14:18.729 --> 01:14:20.431]  You put a million in, ten million.
[01:14:20.431 --> 01:14:24.333]  You put ten million in, they can put out a hundred million.
[01:14:24.333 --> 01:14:27.215]  Put a hundred million in, you see the math.
[01:14:27.215 --> 01:14:32.219]  But in 99, the bankers always had the global rule of
[01:14:33.775 --> 01:14:37.338]  $8 out for every dollar, $10 out for every dollar.
[01:14:37.338 --> 01:14:42.122]  Nations varied, but they always knew that it caused hyperinflation if they went above that.
[01:14:42.122 --> 01:14:44.944]  Or it made the hyperinflation happen too fast.
[01:14:44.944 --> 01:14:52.190]  Any fractional system causes inflation overall, but time hides that inflation tax.
[01:14:52.190 --> 01:14:59.517]  Now, they have layered debt structure derivatives that in some cases are over 60 layers deep.
[01:15:00.518 --> 01:15:02.480]  And all of it is counterfeit and fraud.
[01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:05.023]  So, they're not leveraging it 1 to 10.
[01:15:05.023 --> 01:15:14.274]  They leverage it 10 times, and then they leverage all of that dozens and dozens of times apiece, and then leverage the derivatives of that dozens and dozens of times apiece.
[01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:18.981]  And then they get bailed out when they go down.
[01:15:39.810 --> 01:15:44.312]  Well, or they just blow out a company like Enron, they've already moved the money out the door.
[01:15:44.312 --> 01:15:46.413]  Have you seen the movie Goodfellas?
[01:15:46.413 --> 01:15:58.960]  How they come in, take over the guy's bar and restaurant, never pay for any of the liquor, never pay for any of the veal or the chicken at the restaurant, never pay for insurance, nothing.
[01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:04.783]  And then, a year into this, after they've done nothing but profit, they burn the place down and get the insurance money.
[01:16:05.799 --> 01:16:07.680]  So they burn Enron down.
[01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:13.283]  I told people two years before Enron imploded, it was a narcotics trafficking Ponzi scheme from my inside sources in Houston.
[01:16:13.283 --> 01:16:17.465]  CNN was saying invest in Enron, you know, it's the best, they're the smartest guys in the room.
[01:16:17.465 --> 01:16:25.630]  Meanwhile, it was a front and I saw them moving all their money out to other shell corporations and warned everybody.
[01:16:25.630 --> 01:16:31.933]  In essence, with this fractional banking, it's basically a Ponzi scheme and Madoff was right.
[01:16:32.645 --> 01:16:33.286]  Yes, made off.
[01:16:33.286 --> 01:16:34.927]  Well, it's worse than a Ponzi scheme.
[01:16:34.927 --> 01:16:37.869]  I mean, a Ponzi scheme, the guy has to run at the end.
[01:16:37.869 --> 01:16:41.532]  In this Ponzi scheme, they call in the army and you bow down and lick their boots.
[01:16:41.532 --> 01:16:46.196]  And the public only knows about American Idol and Howard Stern, so they're just going, ooh, ooh, ooh.
[01:16:46.196 --> 01:16:47.597]  See?
[01:16:47.597 --> 01:16:48.298]  Right.
[01:16:48.298 --> 01:16:50.440]  I mean, it's, you know.
[01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:54.003]  No, anyway, yeah, it's just unbelievable.
[01:16:54.003 --> 01:16:56.304]  Just one last comment.
[01:16:56.304 --> 01:17:00.548]  I haven't heard you talk about Mark Phillips or Kathy O'Brien.
[01:17:01.409 --> 01:17:02.390]  Are you familiar with them?
[01:17:02.390 --> 01:17:10.157]  I know that they... Yes, I met them once at an event in Austin, and I just can't document what they're saying, and I'm not saying it's true or not true.
[01:17:10.157 --> 01:17:12.979]  I just can't prove it, so I stay away from it.
[01:17:12.979 --> 01:17:14.681]  Alright, well that's the end of my comments.
[01:17:14.681 --> 01:17:16.863]  Alright, thank you so much Bill, appreciate that.
[01:17:16.863 --> 01:17:18.484]  Lauren in Minnesota, you're on the air.
[01:17:18.484 --> 01:17:21.087]  Listen, hello?
[01:17:21.087 --> 01:17:21.267]  Hey!
[01:17:22.384 --> 01:17:23.847]  Alex, hey good to talk to you.
[01:17:23.847 --> 01:17:31.260]  I just wanted to reference a couple articles on Prison Planet, the MLK article and the Divide and Conquer article.
[01:17:31.710 --> 01:17:37.135]  I just recently attended a union rally here in Minnesota, where Keith Ellison spoke.
[01:17:37.135 --> 01:17:42.641]  He started talking about the Wizard of Oz and Dorothy looking behind the curtain, and I just couldn't shut up.
[01:17:42.641 --> 01:17:45.403]  I said, I had to call him out.
[01:17:45.403 --> 01:17:46.965]  I said, follow the money.
[01:17:46.965 --> 01:17:53.111]  And then he started, he got all distracted, and you can look it up on YouTube, Ellison at Minnesota Union Rally.
[01:17:53.550 --> 01:18:03.554]  And then he started talking about how back in 2000 we were fighting to defeat Bushism, we got two wars, Obama promised it.
[01:18:03.554 --> 01:18:06.655]  So I just want to say who are the puppeteers?
[01:18:06.655 --> 01:18:15.538]  Just look up, and this is where people can print these articles, get them to their friends and family, bring the left and the right together, bring families together, bring the community
[01:18:15.778 --> 01:18:16.438]  Exactly.
[01:18:16.438 --> 01:18:18.959]  It's not that some of the unions aren't corrupt and bad.
[01:18:18.959 --> 01:18:21.220]  The point is you could get rid of it all.
[01:18:21.220 --> 01:18:28.541]  You could fire all those people and it wouldn't pay for one one billionth of the fake debt the bankers have created.
[01:18:28.541 --> 01:18:29.582]  It's a distraction.
[01:18:29.582 --> 01:18:33.923]  The governor in New Jersey, the governor in Wisconsin, you know, they are scapegoating
[01:18:34.523 --> 01:18:34.683]  The
[01:18:49.798 --> 01:18:51.178]  Going after the banksters.
[01:19:08.044 --> 01:19:09.144]  I mean, look at Ireland.
[01:19:09.144 --> 01:19:19.309]  It's admitted in the Irish press, the head of their central bank says the Irish don't owe this money, it's the bankers' debts, but that it's going to be good to have, quote, foreign banks run Ireland.
[01:19:19.309 --> 01:19:22.530]  I mean, you cannot make up those quotes from two months ago.
[01:19:22.530 --> 01:19:24.251]  And same thing in Iceland.
[01:19:24.251 --> 01:19:27.152]  And it came out, the people didn't owe hardly any of it.
[01:19:27.152 --> 01:19:28.192]  It was less than 10%.
[01:19:28.192 --> 01:19:30.233]  It was all the globalist bankers.
[01:19:30.233 --> 01:19:32.014]  They did these deals.
[01:19:32.014 --> 01:19:33.915]  They set this up.
[01:19:33.915 --> 01:19:36.276]  And I appreciate your call.
[01:19:36.276 --> 01:19:36.716]  Anything else?
[01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:38.661]  God bless InfoWars.
[01:19:38.661 --> 01:19:40.683]  This is where the American people can come together.
[01:19:40.683 --> 01:19:50.393]  Look at Charles Lindbergh Sr., the former representative from Minnesota who once ran for governor.
[01:19:50.393 --> 01:19:51.234]  Absolutely.
[01:19:51.234 --> 01:19:52.034]  God bless you, Loren.
[01:19:52.034 --> 01:19:53.096]  We're out of time.
[01:19:53.096 --> 01:19:57.560]  You can get rid of everything, and it's rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.
[01:19:57.560 --> 01:19:58.381]  Okay?
[01:19:58.381 --> 01:19:59.142]  I mean, it's that simple.
[01:20:00.694 --> 01:20:07.278]  Don't you just laugh every time the news plays another story about a foreclosure bank or attorney under investigation, bankrupted, or being sued?
[01:20:07.278 --> 01:20:13.081]  Zero Debt has a program that stops foreclosure, guaranteed for at least two years, without payments or attorneys.
[01:20:13.081 --> 01:20:18.745]  In fact, we show our members how to get the banks to pay their taxes and insurance while they stonewall the bank's collection process.
[01:20:18.745 --> 01:20:23.508]  We show you how it's possible to quiet the title in your name by using the bank's very own foreclosure process.
[01:20:23.508 --> 01:20:25.089]  Loan modification is a joke.
[01:20:25.089 --> 01:20:28.691]  The banks use that to take your money with nothing in return and keeping you in default.
[01:20:28.891 --> 01:20:30.052]  You've heard our ad before.
[01:20:30.052 --> 01:20:32.873]  We are not investors, bankers, attorneys, or real estate agents.

[01:21:16.812 --> 01:21:17.612]  Have you?
[01:21:17.612 --> 01:21:28.915]  Again, this big event has nothing to do with war or the stock market, yet it could change everything about your normal way of life, the way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your family.
[01:21:28.915 --> 01:21:30.095]  Could this really happen?
[01:21:30.095 --> 01:21:34.096]  Well, the man who created this video has been right about many predictions in his career.
[01:21:34.096 --> 01:21:36.277]  He was among the first to predict the collapse of GM.
[01:21:42.142 --> 01:21:42.342]  I'm good.
[01:22:00.606 --> 01:22:01.807]  Go solar for cheap!
[01:22:01.807 --> 01:22:04.248]  Want to use solar power but the price is too high?

[01:22:30.303 --> 01:22:31.544]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:31.544 --> 01:22:36.087]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:22:36.087 --> 01:22:41.910]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:22:41.910 --> 01:22:45.292]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:22:45.552 --> 01:22:48.373]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:48.373 --> 01:22:53.316]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:22:53.316 --> 01:22:53.576]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:53.576 --> 01:22:54.976]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:23:00.492 --> 01:23:03.933]  The largest part of gaining radiant health is detoxification.
[01:23:03.933 --> 01:23:11.754]  You can drink ionized water, cleanse your intestines, eat a perfect diet, and even take lots of quality supplements and in many instances only make minimal progress.
[01:23:11.754 --> 01:23:16.315]  What is the key to detoxifying your body of mercury, heavy metals, chemicals, and drugs?
[01:23:16.315 --> 01:23:17.755]  It is glutathione.
[01:23:17.755 --> 01:23:21.816]  Glutathione is the master antioxidant used to detoxify your entire body.
[01:23:21.816 --> 01:23:25.177]  It stops free radicals, keeps cells young, and reduces inflammation.
[01:23:25.817 --> 01:23:31.601]  One World Whey Protein Powder may be able to raise your glutathione production by 64% or more.
[01:23:31.601 --> 01:23:38.846]  One World Whey is more effective than any other whey protein powder on the market because it is unheated and from grass-fed cows.
[01:23:38.846 --> 01:23:43.670]  All other, quote, cold-processed whey protein powders have been heated and damaged by 15% or more.
[01:23:45.271 --> 01:23:47.672]  One World Way comes in three delicious flavors.
[01:23:47.672 --> 01:23:48.112]  Call 888-988-3325.
[01:23:48.112 --> 01:23:48.312]  That's 888-988-3325.
[01:23:48.312 --> 01:23:49.492]  Or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[01:23:49.492 --> 01:23:50.173]  That's One World W-H-E-Y.com.
[01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:09.301]  Announcing a new currency!
[01:24:09.301 --> 01:24:11.381]  Global SDRs!
[01:24:11.381 --> 01:24:13.502]  Run by the IMF and World Bank!
[01:24:13.502 --> 01:24:15.142]  Cobra Currency!
[01:24:15.142 --> 01:24:26.125]  Yeah, they're coming out with their new global cashless currency that all other currencies are going to be denominated in and based on.
[01:24:26.125 --> 01:24:30.066]  Max Keiser joining us from the Middle East, coming up here in about 10 minutes.
[01:24:31.630 --> 01:24:37.113]  We'll get into what's happening with the open announcements of the end of the dollar, what that will mean, what's happening in the Middle East.
[01:24:37.113 --> 01:24:38.694]  More and more talk of the U.S.
[01:24:38.694 --> 01:24:39.595]  via the U.N.
[01:24:39.595 --> 01:24:43.037]  and NATO invading areas of Libya.
[01:24:43.037 --> 01:24:45.538]  Another horrible idea, but good for the globalist.
[01:24:45.538 --> 01:24:46.339]  Why, it's only U.S.
[01:24:46.339 --> 01:24:48.860]  taxpayer money and American boy's blood.
[01:24:48.860 --> 01:24:49.741]  Why not?
[01:24:49.741 --> 01:24:53.843]  After all, Henry Kissinger called them dumb cannon fodder, dumb animals.
[01:24:53.843 --> 01:24:55.784]  Well, I don't think that about our military.
[01:24:55.784 --> 01:24:57.865]  Let's talk to Juan in California.
[01:24:57.865 --> 01:24:58.906]  Juan, thanks for holding.
[01:24:59.659 --> 01:25:04.581]  Hey Alex, it's an honor speaking to you, and it was an honor seeing you here last October in Santa Cruz.
[01:25:04.581 --> 01:25:06.322]  Well, thank you, sir, for coming out.
[01:25:06.322 --> 01:25:18.068]  Hey, there was a story on the local news last night, and it was a young gentleman who's suing the feds because his mechanic found a GPS tracking system while changing the guy's oil.
[01:25:18.068 --> 01:25:22.550]  And the feds ruled that they're allowed to do that, but then another court ruled they couldn't, correct?
[01:25:23.291 --> 01:25:31.778]  Yeah, I mean, and then he gets knocked on the door by a couple guys in a suit saying they need their device back.
[01:25:31.778 --> 01:25:36.082]  I mean, that's pretty scary.
[01:25:36.082 --> 01:25:37.122]  Well, that's what they're doing.
[01:25:37.122 --> 01:25:38.824]  Look, they don't even need the GPS tracker.
[01:25:38.824 --> 01:25:43.688]  They've got license plate reading cameras all over the country that track you as you drive around.
[01:25:44.932 --> 01:25:52.738]  Yeah, I mean, just like what you said about the license plate that they're going to be coming up with, with the, uh, with that camera or whatever.
[01:25:52.738 --> 01:25:57.161]  Well, it's a digital waterproof screen with messages and propaganda on it.
[01:25:57.161 --> 01:25:58.001]  Yes.
[01:25:58.001 --> 01:25:58.281]  Yep.
[01:25:58.281 --> 01:26:00.483]  I just hope America wakes up.
[01:26:00.483 --> 01:26:05.727]  I mean, we're slowly waking up, but you know, this is reality.
[01:26:05.727 --> 01:26:07.028]  It's got to happen faster, Juan.
[01:26:07.028 --> 01:26:08.529]  Appreciate the good points.
[01:26:08.529 --> 01:26:09.990]  Matt in the UK, you're on the air.
[01:26:12.250 --> 01:26:15.551]  Hi Alex, and good afternoon, and glad to see you back on the radio.
[01:26:15.551 --> 01:26:31.337]  Yeah, my question is basically, I don't know if you've looked in the British BBC news website, basically there's a guy called Johnny Ball who's a local, well, famous children's presenter, science presenter, and basically the Illuminati and the BBC have basically ridiculed him over the climate change fraudness.
[01:26:31.337 --> 01:26:36.799]  He's basically come out to look like it's a total fraud, and basically what they're doing now, obviously in the local schools around where I am,
[01:26:38.788 --> 01:26:58.615]  Well I know that British courts ruled a few years ago that Al Gore's movie has been proven on what was it 14 different points at least to be a manifest fraud and that it can't be shown in schools because it's known propaganda but the government just continues to ignore the court.
[01:26:59.677 --> 01:27:18.442]  And I have seen the reports of people being persecuted, different presenters, I hadn't heard about that, children's presenter, for talking about how this is a fraud when they produce TV ads that show children being murdered in bloody explosions if they don't accept the carbon taxes.
[01:27:18.442 --> 01:27:19.862]  I mean, who can make this stuff up?
[01:27:21.550 --> 01:27:30.892]  Yeah, I mean, I've got two young children of my own, and basically they've been brainwashed, like I say, about this basically Rothschild book.
[01:27:30.892 --> 01:27:33.412]  They brought it home, and it's just basically full of lies.
[01:27:33.412 --> 01:27:37.233]  Well, yeah, that's how we got David Rothschild on three years ago, four years ago.
[01:27:37.233 --> 01:27:43.815]  He had that children's book with the polar bear drowning on the front, because they're the best mammal.
[01:27:47.318 --> 01:27:52.961]  Yeah, but basically my son brought it home and I was just looking through it and I said, look, you know, you've got to realize this is a total fraud.
[01:28:12.685 --> 01:28:16.848]  It's about giving children a self-loathing of humanity and a self-hatred.
[01:28:27.876 --> 01:28:40.170]  And I've talked to so many parents who I know personally, who after brainwashing in school, their 8-year-old or 7-year-old daughter will break down crying when they see a construction site saying they're killing Bambi, they're killing Bambi.
[01:28:40.170 --> 01:28:47.678]  And this is all about imprinting a guilt on the children that they're like little Nazis or something and that humans are bad and having children are bad.
[01:28:49.662 --> 01:28:52.926]  Yeah, I mean, obviously there's Johnny Ball and another guy called David Bellamy.
[01:28:52.926 --> 01:28:55.049]  Lord Monckton would probably know who these are.
[01:28:55.049 --> 01:28:57.652]  A great bottomist, David Bellamy.
[01:28:57.652 --> 01:29:01.717]  And again, they've ridiculed even him on national British TV.
[01:29:01.717 --> 01:29:04.481]  And just, you know, basically mocked him, basically.
[01:29:05.885 --> 01:29:08.088]  Well, we're going to have to get Lord Monckton back on.
[01:29:08.088 --> 01:29:09.369]  It hadn't been on in two or three months.
[01:29:09.369 --> 01:29:21.023]  Let's get Lord Monckton back on, a true staple of this broadcast, to get the latest on the scallywags trying to put in this eco-dictatorship that has zero, zero to do with helping the environment.
[01:29:21.664 --> 01:29:37.875]  As the globalists stampede forward with cross-species rollouts of plant and animal life, as they roll out with super weapons endangering the planet, no controls over heavy superconducting super colliders, doing experiments that they admit could destroy the planet or seriously damage it.
[01:29:37.875 --> 01:29:47.341]  I mean, there's a score of serious issues that threaten this Earth, and it sure isn't carbon dioxide that are part of the carbon cycle on this planet.
[01:29:47.341 --> 01:29:48.722]  We'll be right back with Max Keiser.
[01:29:50.916 --> 01:29:54.839]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.839 --> 01:30:00.664]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.664 --> 01:30:01.805]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:30:01.805 --> 01:30:08.751]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:30:08.751 --> 01:30:11.293]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:30:11.293 --> 01:30:16.478]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:30:16.658 --> 01:30:19.720]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:22.021]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:30:22.021 --> 01:30:28.284]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:30:28.284 --> 01:30:31.666]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:30:31.666 --> 01:30:37.449]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:30:37.449 --> 01:30:39.090]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:30:39.090 --> 01:30:40.371]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:30:40.371 --> 01:30:42.892]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:30:43.052 --> 01:30:47.276]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:30:47.276 --> 01:30:51.900]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:30:51.900 --> 01:30:54.482]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[01:30:54.482 --> 01:30:58.345]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:30:58.345 --> 01:30:59.366]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:31:00.692 --> 01:31:04.273]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[01:31:04.273 --> 01:31:05.393]  It ended on June of 2009.
[01:31:05.393 --> 01:31:09.955]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[01:31:09.955 --> 01:31:15.897]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[01:31:15.897 --> 01:31:18.057]  Gold and Silver haven't heard the news either.
[01:31:18.057 --> 01:31:21.098]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[01:31:21.098 --> 01:31:27.600]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:29.381]  They both make fabulous investments.
[01:31:29.781 --> 01:31:35.124]  Food is our greatest dependency and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[01:31:35.124 --> 01:31:40.428]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis and you can't eat paper, stocks or metals.
[01:31:40.428 --> 01:31:45.791]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious easy fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[01:31:45.791 --> 01:31:48.993]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.

[01:32:04.188 --> 01:32:05.449]  Tyranny is here.
[01:32:05.449 --> 01:32:09.170]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:32:09.170 --> 01:32:11.611]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:32:11.611 --> 01:32:17.473]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:32:17.473 --> 01:32:23.716]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:32:24.136 --> 01:32:30.117]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:32:30.117 --> 01:32:34.278]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:32:34.278 --> 01:32:38.579]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:32:38.579 --> 01:32:44.520]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:48.080]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:50.061]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:32:50.061 --> 01:32:50.501]  It's here.

[01:33:01.543 --> 01:33:03.463]  You are obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth.
[01:33:03.463 --> 01:33:04.843]  A lie!
[01:33:04.843 --> 01:33:06.824]  No man is obsolete!
[01:33:06.824 --> 01:33:08.704]  You have no function, Mr. Wordsworth.
[01:33:08.704 --> 01:33:11.965]  You're an anachronism, like a ghost from another time!
[01:33:11.965 --> 01:33:17.405]  I am nothing more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages!
[01:33:17.405 --> 01:33:19.086]  You're a bug, Mr. Wordsworth!
[01:33:19.086 --> 01:33:20.166]  A crawling insect!
[01:33:20.846 --> 01:33:25.248]  Ugly, misformed little creature who has no purpose here, no meaning!
[01:33:25.248 --> 01:33:26.769]  I am a human being!
[01:33:26.769 --> 01:33:34.493]  Words, Mr. Wordsworth, that have no substance and no dimension, like air, like the wind!
[01:33:34.493 --> 01:33:35.653]  I don't care!
[01:33:35.653 --> 01:33:37.214]  I tell you, I don't care!
[01:33:37.214 --> 01:33:38.255]  I'm a human being!
[01:33:38.255 --> 01:33:38.755]  I exist!
[01:33:39.833 --> 01:33:45.956]  If I speak one thought aloud, that thought lives, even after I'm shoveled into my grave!
[01:33:45.956 --> 01:33:49.117]  Delusions, Mr. Wordsworth!
[01:33:49.117 --> 01:33:56.801]  Delusions that you inject into your veins to make you think you have a strength, when you have no strength at all!
[01:33:56.801 --> 01:34:02.163]  You have nothing but spindly limbs and a dream, and the state has no use for your kind!
[01:34:03.846 --> 01:34:07.949]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:34:07.949 --> 01:34:12.312]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:34:12.312 --> 01:34:22.840]  We are live, and for the rest of the hour, maybe a little bit into the next, joining us via video Skype from high atop a hotel in Cairo, Egypt, is the one and only Max Keiser.
[01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:27.643]  Talk about the announcement by the Wall Street Journal, why the dollar's reign is nearing an end.
[01:34:28.484 --> 01:34:31.848]  Time Magazine saying the good times are over for the United States.
[01:34:31.848 --> 01:34:34.191]  Well, yeah, if we don't kick the banksters out.
[01:34:34.191 --> 01:34:35.773]  We'll be talking to Max Keiser in a moment.
[01:34:35.773 --> 01:34:41.259]  But tomorrow, for a full hour, the one and only Mark Dice will be joining us.
[01:34:41.259 --> 01:34:42.961]  The only place to get his new book.
[01:34:42.961 --> 01:34:46.145]  You can pre-order it now, but it starts shipping, what, in like 20 days?
[01:34:47.566 --> 01:34:48.707]  You can pre-order it now.
[01:34:48.707 --> 01:34:55.130]  Big Brother, The Orwellian Nightmare, and I have a beautiful copy of it here in my hot little hands.
[01:34:55.130 --> 01:35:03.595]  You can go to InfoWars.com and link through on the secure online video shopping cart.
[01:35:03.595 --> 01:35:04.816]  And you can find where you can get it.
[01:35:04.816 --> 01:35:09.458]  We've also got some discounts there where you can get videos discounted when you get it.
[01:35:09.458 --> 01:35:10.359]  Big Brother.
[01:35:11.994 --> 01:35:16.218]  And the full title is The Orwellian Nightmare Come True by Mark Dice.
[01:35:16.218 --> 01:35:19.261]  This is his most powerful book yet.
[01:35:19.261 --> 01:35:21.703]  There is certainly no doubt about that.
[01:35:21.703 --> 01:35:24.986]  We also have the new V for Victory, You Are the Resistance t-shirts.
[01:35:24.986 --> 01:35:31.272]  Very popular, a great way to meet like-minded people and share the truth about the New World Order and to get conversations going.
[01:35:31.272 --> 01:35:36.497]  But in Big Brother, Mark Dice details actual high-tech spy gadgets, mind-reading machines,
[01:35:37.077 --> 01:35:44.061]  Emerging artificial intelligence systems and government projects that seem as if they came right out of George Orwell's novel 1984.
[01:35:44.061 --> 01:35:57.668]  Orwell's famous book was first published in 49 and tells the story of a nightmarish future where citizens have lost all privacy and are continuously monitored by the omnipresent Big Brother surveillance system which keeps them obedient to the totalitarian government.
[01:35:57.668 --> 01:36:04.092]  The novel is eerily prophetic as many of the fictional systems of surveillance described have now become a reality.
[01:36:04.092 --> 01:36:06.273]  Mark Dice shows you the scary documentation
[01:36:06.553 --> 01:36:11.054]  that Big Brother is watching you and is more powerful than you could imagine.
[01:36:11.054 --> 01:36:29.639]  Mind reading machines, Orwellian government programs, Orwellian weapons, data mine, psychotronics, analysis of 1984, facial recognition cameras, cybernetic organisms, neural interfaces, artificial intelligence, RFID, the nanny state, by the author of the Illuminati Facts and Fiction.
[01:36:29.639 --> 01:36:35.080]  All of his books, by the way, are available at InfoWars.com, but we have the book first,
[01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:47.664]  And for three months after its publish, publishing its official shipping date coming up in just a few weeks, the only place to get it is InfoWars.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:36:47.664 --> 01:36:48.284]  We're helping him.
[01:36:52.885 --> 01:36:56.407]  With the rollout, because we have our own fulfillment system, he wanted us to team up with him.
[01:36:56.407 --> 01:36:58.988]  We have, and so he's the publisher of it.
[01:36:58.988 --> 01:36:59.868]  It's not my book.
[01:36:59.868 --> 01:37:01.549]  I didn't produce it.
[01:37:01.549 --> 01:37:04.570]  I'm not the... I have no rights to it, to be clear.
[01:37:04.570 --> 01:37:08.031]  I'm just helping roll the book out because I think it's so powerful.
[01:37:08.031 --> 01:37:09.372]  By Mark Dice.
[01:37:09.372 --> 01:37:11.793]  Big Brother, The Orwellian Nightmare Come True.
[01:37:11.793 --> 01:37:14.214]  Get it first at InfoWars.com.
[01:37:14.214 --> 01:37:15.154]  Get your pre-orders in.
[01:37:15.154 --> 01:37:17.015]  What's the official ship date?
[01:37:17.015 --> 01:37:17.916]  I think it's March 21st, isn't it?
[01:37:19.477 --> 01:37:20.177]  I don't think so.
[01:37:34.634 --> 01:37:34.834]  I think?
[01:37:51.035 --> 01:37:56.879]  You'll have a master degree in Big Brother if you get this book, Big Brother, The Orwellian Nightmare Come True.
[01:37:56.879 --> 01:37:58.400]  Again, available at InfoWars.com.
[01:37:58.400 --> 01:38:01.061]  You can also write to us at P.O.
[01:38:01.061 --> 01:38:01.982]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas, 78760.
[01:38:01.982 --> 01:38:02.682]  Again, P.O.
[01:38:02.682 --> 01:38:03.783]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas, 78760.
[01:38:03.783 --> 01:38:07.325]  It's $19.95, $5 shipping and handling to get Big Brother, The Orwellian Nightmare Come True by Mark Dice.
[01:38:07.325 --> 01:38:08.266]  Now, shifting gears,
[01:38:20.763 --> 01:38:23.706]  And going to Max Keiser.
[01:38:23.706 --> 01:38:28.150]  Max Keiser is a filmmaker, broadcaster, and former broker on Options Trader.
[01:38:28.150 --> 01:38:39.080]  He's known for his invention of the virtual specialist technology that is ubiquitous across stock markets today, a software system used by the Hollywood Stock Exchange, and for his accurate predictions of global economic events.
[01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:43.805]  He correctly predicted the collapse of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac years before the breakdown of Iceland's economy.
[01:38:44.225 --> 01:38:45.786]  He had inside knowledge on that.
[01:38:45.786 --> 01:38:51.307]  And the subprime mortgage-backed securities would cause an 08 recession.
[01:38:51.307 --> 01:38:57.249]  And he also launched the Crash JP Morgan Buy Silver program here on this broadcast.
[01:38:57.249 --> 01:39:04.031]  He has a show on RT, Press TV, BBC, Saturday Morning Show, here on GenesisMaxKaiser.com.
[01:39:04.031 --> 01:39:07.492]  Our sites again, InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:39:07.492 --> 01:39:12.134]  We're going to cover a lot of issues, but Saudi Arabia contagion triggers Gulf Route.
[01:39:13.094 --> 01:39:20.097]  There's talk of U.N.-backed, NATO-backed invasion of the nearby country to you right now.
[01:39:20.097 --> 01:39:21.397]  You're in Cairo, Egypt.
[01:39:21.397 --> 01:39:23.438]  They're in Libya.
[01:39:23.438 --> 01:39:27.379]  I want to get your breakdown on what you're seeing on the ground in Cairo.
[01:39:27.379 --> 01:39:29.620]  Max Keiser, thank you for joining us via video Skype.
[01:39:30.646 --> 01:39:32.607]  Yeah, my pleasure, Alex Jones.
[01:39:32.607 --> 01:39:34.968]  Always a pleasure to be on the InfoWars.
[01:39:34.968 --> 01:39:37.489]  Yes, I'm in Cairo, Egypt.
[01:39:37.489 --> 01:39:42.070]  And what I can tell you, Alex, is that revolutions work.
[01:39:42.070 --> 01:39:43.631]  Revolutions work.
[01:39:43.631 --> 01:39:48.053]  The people here have staged a revolution, a people's revolution.
[01:39:48.053 --> 01:39:50.153]  They toppled the dictator Mubarak.
[01:39:50.153 --> 01:39:52.034]  Mubarak tried to put somebody else in.
[01:39:52.034 --> 01:39:53.355]  That guy is now gone.
[01:39:54.595 --> 01:40:00.580]  There's a huge rally here in Tahrir Square Friday for people amassing once again.
[01:40:00.580 --> 01:40:04.503]  The objective is to write a new constitution.
[01:40:04.503 --> 01:40:11.469]  And I urge everybody who listens to your show to take a look at what's happening here in Cairo.
[01:40:11.469 --> 01:40:15.152]  Because you've got a dictator there at the Federal Reserve Bank.
[01:40:15.152 --> 01:40:18.054]  There needs to be a regime change in the U.S.
[01:40:18.054 --> 01:40:18.855]  if Egyptians
[01:40:19.295 --> 01:40:21.896]  Can revolt and get rid of the dictator?
[01:40:21.896 --> 01:40:25.337]  Why can't Americans revolt and get rid of their dictators?
[01:40:25.337 --> 01:40:27.717]  And it all happened on new media.
[01:40:27.717 --> 01:40:29.898]  It all happened on social networking.
[01:40:29.898 --> 01:40:34.019]  And I was talking to a lot of the demonstrators and the revolutionaries here.
[01:40:34.019 --> 01:40:39.041]  And they just told me that everybody was on Facebook and social networking sites.
[01:40:39.041 --> 01:40:46.103]  And then one day, as if by some spontaneous magic of a revolutionary fever, just gripped the entire country.
[01:40:46.103 --> 01:40:46.943]  And they said, you know what?
[01:40:47.583 --> 01:40:49.826]  Why don't we just topple this government?
[01:40:49.826 --> 01:40:51.308]  And here's the key, Alex.
[01:40:51.308 --> 01:40:58.077]  I had one of the revolutionaries on my show as a guest today, and I asked him straightforward, I said, who's leading the revolution?
[01:40:58.077 --> 01:41:00.560]  And the answer is, no one.
[01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:03.103]  Because there is no straight leadership.
[01:41:03.103 --> 01:41:05.767]  It's a social network revolution, the first in history.
[01:41:06.067 --> 01:41:07.848]  So there's nobody to go out and attack.
[01:41:07.848 --> 01:41:11.749]  Nobody can say, well, let's get the revolutionary leader and the revolution dies.
[01:41:11.749 --> 01:41:12.909]  It's not going to happen.
[01:41:12.909 --> 01:41:19.632]  This is going to continue until you create a real true people's movement here in Egypt.
[01:41:19.632 --> 01:41:22.113]  And what's amazing is that the people here
[01:41:23.013 --> 01:41:35.501]  Well, speak their mind, and then they'll try to catch themselves and they say, oh, I wonder if the police are listening, and then they have that moment of recognition where they realize that, wait a minute, the police aren't listening, I'm free!
[01:41:35.501 --> 01:41:45.068]  Contrast that with people in America now, who speak their mind, and then have a moment of recognition where they wonder, is the police listening to me, and then they shut up!
[01:41:46.184 --> 01:41:48.886]  Okay, it's two ships passing in the night, Alex.
[01:41:48.886 --> 01:41:52.148]  America going toward dictatorship and tyranny.
[01:41:52.148 --> 01:41:55.290]  Egypt heading toward democracy and freedom.
[01:41:55.290 --> 01:42:03.596]  Max, a beautiful shot over your shoulder there of the Mediterranean off of your shoulder or is that or is that
[01:42:05.233 --> 01:42:13.299]  Now that's the Nile there, so there's a little bit of a reverb because you're talking kind of towards the glass door.
[01:42:13.299 --> 01:42:25.467]  If you can rotate to your right about 10 or 15 degrees and move the laptop, it won't be as cool a shot, but your audio won't be bouncing off that glass door there at your hotel or on the roof or wherever you're at.
[01:42:25.467 --> 01:42:31.371]  I just want to try to be able to really clearly hear you here, Max, but the audio is passable.
[01:42:32.847 --> 01:42:47.988]  I'm not taking issue with you, but there's no doubt that the globalists tracking social networks a month and a half ago, knowing food prices were going up due to dollar devaluation in the Middle East, knew that a revolution was coming, the dominoes were already set up, they tried to trigger it.
[01:42:48.809 --> 01:42:51.911]  Sending in Alberti a few weeks before it began.
[01:42:51.911 --> 01:42:54.412]  There's no doubt the West wants to overthrow Gaddafi.
[01:42:54.412 --> 01:43:00.335]  There's no doubt that the rebellion is real, but I'm worried about the overall aftershocks of this.
[01:43:00.335 --> 01:43:05.337]  But you're saying you have confidence, Max Keiser, that this is real, this is organic?
[01:43:06.550 --> 01:43:08.152]  Yeah, it is real, and it is organic.
[01:43:08.152 --> 01:43:17.762]  I'm on the street, I'm talking to these people directly, I'm doing shows right here, and they have the notion now that they can rebuild this country in their image.
[01:43:17.762 --> 01:43:23.808]  And the People's Revolution is on the street, and it's spreading around this whole region, as you know.
[01:43:23.808 --> 01:43:29.114]  And what's beautiful about the social networking sites is part of the info wars, as you know,
[01:43:29.874 --> 01:43:34.497]  What's beautiful about it is, as I said, there's no leader to attack.
[01:43:34.497 --> 01:43:36.278]  So it's widespread.
[01:43:36.278 --> 01:43:38.219]  It's decentralized.
[01:43:38.219 --> 01:43:42.061]  And the idea itself is bigger than any leader.
[01:43:42.061 --> 01:43:43.701]  And so this is happening.
[01:43:43.701 --> 01:43:45.262]  It's gathering speed.
[01:43:45.262 --> 01:43:48.344]  And the people, as I said, it's like two ships passing in the night.
[01:43:48.344 --> 01:43:50.305]  When I'm here in Egypt, there's a feeling of freedom.
[01:43:50.865 --> 01:43:51.846]  New freedom.
[01:43:51.846 --> 01:43:58.211]  And when I talk to people in America, it's a freedom of shutting down, heading into the prison state, heading into the gulag state.
[01:43:58.211 --> 01:44:00.012]  So it's a complete opposite feeling.
[01:44:00.012 --> 01:44:01.633]  Here it's genuine freedom.
[01:44:01.633 --> 01:44:03.315]  People really have a taste for it.
[01:44:03.315 --> 01:44:04.315]  And it's remarkable.
[01:44:04.315 --> 01:44:09.680]  So the people are genuinely angry, but there's not a clear leadership.
[01:44:09.680 --> 01:44:14.443]  And if the leadership doesn't deliver what the people want, the people now know the power they have.
[01:44:14.443 --> 01:44:20.408]  You're saying the momentum has shifted towards the independent person
[01:44:22.630 --> 01:44:23.151]  Absolutely.
[01:44:23.151 --> 01:44:27.675]  The power has shifted and exactly right.
[01:44:27.675 --> 01:44:35.183]  No matter what the current leadership in office suggests is what they want to do, the people are responding.
[01:44:35.183 --> 01:44:39.207]  For example, they tried to put in a new Prime Minister recently.
[01:44:39.207 --> 01:44:41.690]  Today he resigned because the people said we don't want that guy.
[01:44:42.230 --> 01:44:50.898]  Now imagine if the people of America had the power to choose who was maybe going to run or not run the Federal Reserve Bank, for example.
[01:44:50.898 --> 01:44:52.539]  I mean, what a remarkable idea!
[01:44:52.539 --> 01:44:53.380]  Democracy!
[01:44:53.380 --> 01:44:54.681]  What a remarkable idea!
[01:44:54.681 --> 01:44:55.822]  People power!
[01:44:55.822 --> 01:45:07.193]  And the key to this whole technologically-enabled, enhanced revolution... And of course, the government can't shut down the Internet without shutting down the entire country.
[01:45:07.193 --> 01:45:08.474]  So they don't have that option.
[01:45:08.914 --> 01:45:10.736]  So they are beat.
[01:45:10.736 --> 01:45:15.400]  This current leadership in this country and around the region are basically out of business.
[01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:18.062]  And this is, the people now are pushing forward.
[01:45:18.062 --> 01:45:23.066]  And of course it's not based on Islam, it's not based on any politics, it's not based on any religion.
[01:45:23.066 --> 01:45:31.273]  I see Glenn Beck over in the UK and in the US is trying to push this line that this is an Islamist revolution.
[01:45:32.074 --> 01:45:37.097]  Which is completely wrong, and there's nothing religious or theocratic about this people's revolution.
[01:45:37.097 --> 01:45:53.647]  Well, there's certainly the Muslim Brotherhood element in it, but expanding on that, looking to the West there with what's happening in Libya, what's your view on Muammar Gaddafi with all the British weapons he's got, the open talk of having some type of NATO slash UN slash US
[01:45:55.148 --> 01:45:59.450]  Ad-hoc group going in there currently backing the rebels in the east.
[01:45:59.450 --> 01:46:01.151]  They're on the border with Egypt.
[01:46:01.151 --> 01:46:04.973]  What do you think about the incredible turmoil popping up in Saudi Arabia?
[01:46:04.973 --> 01:46:06.034]  Do you see this thing spreading?
[01:46:07.076 --> 01:46:16.498]  Well, the question with Qaddafi, you have to ask yourself, is they discovered he's got $30 billion parked in banks in the UK and the US.
[01:46:16.498 --> 01:46:26.301]  Now, that money was parked after the Patriot Act was enacted, which supposedly put in rules in force that would prevent that kind of activity from happening.
[01:46:26.681 --> 01:46:30.664]  So, did Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan give Qaddafi a waiver?
[01:46:30.664 --> 01:46:34.366]  Did the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner give Qaddafi a waiver?
[01:46:34.366 --> 01:46:36.147]  He didn't have to comply with the law.
[01:46:36.147 --> 01:46:38.268]  Why doesn't Qaddafi have to comply with the law?
[01:46:38.268 --> 01:46:40.790]  And everyone else does have to comply with the law.
[01:46:40.790 --> 01:46:41.911]  What about Tony Blair?
[01:46:41.911 --> 01:46:44.912]  Wasn't he Qaddafi's good friend just two or three years ago?
[01:46:44.912 --> 01:46:48.795]  Selling him arms, cooking up blood for oil deals after the Iraq...
[01:46:49.375 --> 01:46:50.536]  Uh, Fandango?
[01:46:50.536 --> 01:46:51.736]  Where's Blair in all this?
[01:46:51.736 --> 01:46:55.398]  How come Tony Blair's not out there supporting his friend, Colonel Gaddafi?
[01:46:55.398 --> 01:47:01.241]  It's utter lunacy and hypocrisy, uh, that Gaddafi... Well, that's just like a few months ago it came out that one U.S.
[01:47:01.241 --> 01:47:11.966]  bank alone laundered $360-plus billion in Mexican narcotics money and was even chartering the airplanes and owning the airplanes for them, but the banks don't get in trouble for this.
[01:47:13.928 --> 01:47:14.608]  Exactly right.
[01:47:14.608 --> 01:47:31.356]  So the banks are on a two-speed economy and a two-speed politics, which is a kleptocracy, which is too tyrannical, which is why Americans should be revolting, which is why there should be a million people crossing the Brooklyn Bridge and surrounding the Federal Reserve Bank in New York and demanding the current Fed head of the New York Fed comes out!
[01:47:31.356 --> 01:47:31.797]  That's right.
[01:47:31.797 --> 01:47:33.978]  People shouldn't... I mean, people always talk about marching.
[01:47:33.978 --> 01:47:39.360]  Washington is where the castrated ceremonial puppets are.
[01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:42.362]  If people are really going to march, it should be on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
[01:47:44.033 --> 01:47:44.613]  Absolutely.
[01:47:44.613 --> 01:47:46.635]  I mean, that's where the dictatorship is.
[01:47:46.635 --> 01:47:48.036]  Revolutions work, Alex.
[01:47:48.036 --> 01:48:00.965]  That's my message from Cairo, Egypt, is that if it's a decentralized, true, organic people's revolution, the establishment powers, even if they're armed like these regimes are armed, they can't do anything about it.
[01:48:00.965 --> 01:48:03.987]  So the question to Americans are, what are you waiting for?
[01:48:03.987 --> 01:48:05.188]  The time is now.
[01:48:05.188 --> 01:48:07.069]  You're being held hostage by tyrants.
[01:48:07.649 --> 01:48:13.171]  Why are you letting people in North Africa and the Middle East make you look like you like being in prison?
[01:48:13.171 --> 01:48:15.152]  That you like being ruled over by tyrants?
[01:48:15.152 --> 01:48:17.233]  What are you waiting for?
[01:48:17.233 --> 01:48:24.516]  Max, looking at other areas of the Middle East, the Saudi King pumping out 37 million last week, millions more this week.
[01:48:24.516 --> 01:48:26.557]  Tanks rolling around the streets there.
[01:48:26.557 --> 01:48:28.258]  What's the feeling on the street in Cairo?
[01:48:28.258 --> 01:48:33.460]  Is it that this revolution against the plutocrats and the corrupt royalty and the dictators is going to continue?
[01:48:34.568 --> 01:48:35.669]  Well, it's definitely spreading.
[01:48:35.669 --> 01:48:40.171]  You know, outside of Saudi Arabia is Bahrain, and that has been very active.
[01:48:40.171 --> 01:48:43.852]  And Saudi Arabia is the kingpin in the region.
[01:48:43.852 --> 01:48:46.393]  They're the... You know, there's three big players in the...
[01:48:48.391 --> 01:48:51.952]  North Africa, the Middle East, Saudi Arabia, Israel, and the United States.
[01:48:51.952 --> 01:48:55.853]  And the Saudi Arabian unrest is percolating.
[01:48:55.853 --> 01:49:03.695]  The royal family is trying to buy off the people by increasing the amount of money they're giving them.
[01:49:03.695 --> 01:49:06.235]  We see this happening in other regimes as well.
[01:49:06.235 --> 01:49:07.916]  They're trying to buy the people off.
[01:49:07.916 --> 01:49:09.256]  But the people at this point
[01:49:10.176 --> 01:49:15.341]  They're feeling that no money, no amount of money can buy them off because they want to feel something more than money.
[01:49:15.341 --> 01:49:16.862]  They want to feel integrity.
[01:49:16.862 --> 01:49:18.704]  They want to feel like their life is worth something.
[01:49:18.704 --> 01:49:29.594]  Well, that's the bigger issue is that in these corrupt, swaggering police states, people are tired of the arrogance and the abuse of the security forces, and they always want it to go away.
[01:49:29.594 --> 01:49:36.580]  And no amount of money by these arrogant bureaucracies, whether it's here or in Saudi Arabia, is going to assuage the people's rage.
[01:49:38.055 --> 01:49:44.098]  No, and remember when Bush took office back when he threw that election back in 2000 and it began in 2004.
[01:49:44.098 --> 01:49:49.221]  He really sent everybody in America a check for between $600 and $1,200.
[01:49:49.221 --> 01:49:56.164]  So he's mimicking these Middle East kings and rulers by giving the peasants a few dollars to shut them up.
[01:49:56.164 --> 01:49:57.625]  I mean, how outrageous is that?
[01:49:57.625 --> 01:50:00.367]  I mean, is that all a life in America is worth?
[01:50:00.367 --> 01:50:04.148]  $600 from Bush, the royal monarch?
[01:50:04.148 --> 01:50:06.570]  I mean, give yourself some kind of self-respect!
[01:50:09.352 --> 01:50:14.034]  Max, when we come back from break, I want to get into more of what's happening in the Middle East.
[01:50:14.034 --> 01:50:16.976]  Maybe keep you a little bit of the next hour if we can.
[01:50:16.976 --> 01:50:20.857]  Joining us again via video link from Cairo, Egypt, right off the Nile there.
[01:50:20.857 --> 01:50:24.279]  Amazing video shot of your PrisonPlanet.tv viewer.
[01:50:24.279 --> 01:50:26.980]  Radio listeners are again getting to hear his analysis.
[01:50:26.980 --> 01:50:32.843]  I want to get into this sudden announcement in the Wall Street Journal, in Time Magazine, that America's over.
[01:50:33.163 --> 01:50:35.005]  That the dollar is going to die.
[01:50:35.005 --> 01:50:37.086]  Why you think they're announcing that now?
[01:50:37.086 --> 01:50:38.567]  What this signifies?
[01:50:38.567 --> 01:50:46.474]  The Chinese openly announcing that they're going to demand all trade by the end of this year be in their currency.
[01:50:46.474 --> 01:50:47.434]  The yuan.
[01:50:47.434 --> 01:50:50.417]  These are earth-shattering economic announcements.
[01:50:50.417 --> 01:50:54.440]  It's old news for our audience, but it's big that it's now being announced.
[01:50:54.440 --> 01:50:56.061]  Max Keiser is our guest.
[01:50:56.061 --> 01:50:56.782]  I'm Alex Jones.

[01:51:14.681 --> 01:51:18.663]  I was diagnosed with having mitral valve prolapse 10 years ago.
[01:51:18.663 --> 01:51:22.625]  My cardiologist said surgery and drugs was the only thing he could offer me.
[01:51:22.785 --> 01:51:23.626]  What did Crystal do?
[01:51:23.626 --> 01:51:27.571]  I ordered Heart and Body Extract in August 2006.
[01:51:27.571 --> 01:51:33.998]  When I first took my first 15 drops, I embraced the formula and could even feel the goodness of the formula starting to work.

[01:52:00.552 --> 01:52:01.853]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:01.853 --> 01:52:07.439]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:07.439 --> 01:52:12.464]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:12.464 --> 01:52:18.049]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:52:18.049 --> 01:52:19.871]  So, our friends at Solutions from Science,
[01:52:20.131 --> 01:52:20.632]  We're good to go.

[01:53:01.463 --> 01:53:05.925]  Fight back this cold and flu season with the world's best garlic extract, Ali-C.
[01:53:05.925 --> 01:53:06.785]  Why Ali-C?

[01:53:18.391 --> 01:53:23.975]  Ali-C contains 300 milligrams of stabilized allicin, the active ingredient in crushed garlic.

[01:54:14.011 --> 01:54:23.259]  Max Keiser's with us five minutes to the next hour and then I had scheduled from last week an interview part two with Lenny Dykstra who has beaten JP Morgan in court.
[01:54:23.259 --> 01:54:25.821]  He's beaten the SEC over 200 times.
[01:54:25.821 --> 01:54:31.306]  Remember they took his houses, claimed that he was, you know, insolvent.
[01:54:31.306 --> 01:54:33.388]  I want to get him on to talk about mortgage fraud.
[01:54:33.388 --> 01:54:35.450]  We'll also talk about Charlie Sheen some.
[01:54:35.450 --> 01:54:37.552]  I was in a meeting for an hour and a half last night with Lenny and
[01:54:37.892 --> 01:54:40.114]  And Charlie, we won't get into that private meeting.
[01:54:40.114 --> 01:54:43.937]  The point is we're trying to help Charlie out to navigate through all this stuff that's going on.
[01:54:43.937 --> 01:54:47.641]  So that's coming up in about 10 minutes from now.
[01:54:47.641 --> 01:54:49.142]  Going back to Max Keiser.
[01:54:49.142 --> 01:54:55.488]  Max, what do you make of the Wall Street Journal coming out today and saying why the dollar's reign is near an end?
[01:54:55.488 --> 01:54:56.128]  The Chinese...
[01:54:57.029 --> 01:55:06.443]  Have come out today and saying by the end of this year they want all trade all purchases of Chinese goods to be in their currency.
[01:55:06.443 --> 01:55:08.365]  Why are they doing this now and how big is this?
[01:55:10.046 --> 01:55:13.187]  Well they're doing it now because there's no denying it anymore.
[01:55:13.187 --> 01:55:17.729]  They can't hide it anymore and everybody knows it.
[01:55:17.729 --> 01:55:19.969]  I mean this is no secret.
[01:55:19.969 --> 01:55:28.372]  The dollar is no longer going to work as a world reserve currency anymore and we're moving toward a new global currency grid.
[01:55:28.372 --> 01:55:30.733]  The dollar is going to play a lot less of a role
[01:55:30.953 --> 01:55:42.064]  The key to understand is that when the time for the dollar to devalue comes, it'll happen in one day, and suddenly everything in America will cost two to three times more.
[01:55:42.064 --> 01:55:45.467]  And the president will say, well, we had no choice.
[01:55:45.467 --> 01:55:51.333]  We had to devalue the dollar because it's going to help you, our export market is going to help you get jobs.
[01:55:51.333 --> 01:55:55.457]  Of course, the only jobs that America will be qualified for at that point will be cock kicking.
[01:55:55.997 --> 01:56:01.299]  So you're going to have 20 million cotton pickers in America competing with cotton pickers around the world.
[01:56:01.299 --> 01:56:02.319]  So it's over.
[01:56:02.319 --> 01:56:05.040]  The Wall Street Journal is stating the obvious.
[01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:09.022]  At some point it's embarrassing for them to pretend like this is not the case.
[01:56:09.022 --> 01:56:13.203]  I mean, they have to at least recognize what's the obvious situation.
[01:56:13.203 --> 01:56:14.944]  So they can't hide it anymore.
[01:56:14.944 --> 01:56:17.044]  It's exactly what we've been saying on your show.
[01:56:17.044 --> 01:56:19.405]  And it's why gold and silver are hitting new highs.
[01:56:19.405 --> 01:56:24.047]  They'll continue to hit new highs because the fiat currency regime and the U.S.
[01:56:24.047 --> 01:56:24.387]  dollar
[01:56:24.747 --> 01:56:25.488]  Period.
[01:56:25.488 --> 01:56:26.109]  It's finished.
[01:56:26.109 --> 01:56:29.352]  It's that simple.
[01:56:29.352 --> 01:56:39.384]  Max, but the question is why have they gone from denying that this was a certainty mathematically with what they've done with the dollar globally to now saying yes it's coming?
[01:56:41.482 --> 01:56:56.536]  Well, I think that they're now preparing to set up the new banking facilities because, you know, when the dollar crashes and it's replaced with another global currency of some type, an expanded special drawing rights, that's a huge piece of business for the banksters.
[01:56:56.536 --> 01:56:58.257]  They will have to convert U.S.
[01:56:58.257 --> 01:57:00.859]  dollars into SDRs, trade bonds based on that.
[01:57:00.859 --> 01:57:05.363]  Remember, before Davos, they said they needed to trade a $100 trillion new credit facility?
[01:57:05.363 --> 01:57:06.765]  That's huge fees!
[01:57:07.205 --> 01:57:09.707]  For Morgan and Goldman Sachs are the banksters.
[01:57:09.707 --> 01:57:18.675]  So they're preparing for a huge piece of business and their Christmas bonuses next year will be based on dismantling the dollar and rolling out the new currency.
[01:57:18.675 --> 01:57:29.665]  So I would anticipate that within the next three to six months, the Wall Street Journal will introduce America to the new currency and how great it is and how everyone's going to love it.
[01:57:29.665 --> 01:57:32.348]  And by the way, the banks of Wall Street are going to make a huge killing
[01:57:32.828 --> 01:57:39.174]  In issuing bonds in this new currency and everything's going to be created in this new currency and it's going to be fantastic.
[01:57:39.174 --> 01:57:51.125]  Of course what they won't mention is that it's going to lower the purchasing power of Americans by 50 to 60 percent and America will officially be in the second world and making its way to the third world.
[01:57:52.674 --> 01:58:01.622]  Unless we finally kick the real government, it's illegitimate, but it's the government, this banking cartel, out of the country.
[01:58:01.622 --> 01:58:03.084]  I mean, it's either us or them.
[01:58:04.224 --> 01:58:15.053]  Well, Alex, okay, the bridge right behind me here in Cairo, a million people walked over that bridge four weeks ago and toppled their government without a single shot, without any guns, with nothing.
[01:58:15.053 --> 01:58:19.076]  No money, no military, just with the will to be free.
[01:58:19.076 --> 01:58:20.337]  It happened right here.
[01:58:20.337 --> 01:58:24.301]  So you tell me there's a regime in America that's tyrants are ruling the country.
[01:58:24.301 --> 01:58:25.362]  What are you waiting for?
[01:58:25.882 --> 01:58:27.864]  What are you waiting for, America?
[01:58:27.864 --> 01:58:29.325]  What are you waiting for?
[01:58:29.325 --> 01:58:30.606]  What is it going to take?
[01:58:30.606 --> 01:58:31.987]  How many of you have to go to jail?
[01:58:31.987 --> 01:58:33.968]  How many of you have money stolen?
[01:58:33.968 --> 01:58:38.211]  How many jobs have to be outsourced to Egypt and the rest of the world?
[01:58:38.211 --> 01:58:39.132]  How many lies?
[01:58:39.132 --> 01:58:42.415]  Stay there.
[01:58:42.415 --> 01:58:43.836]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:43.836 --> 01:58:46.498]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.731 --> 01:58:54.573]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[01:58:54.573 --> 01:58:58.855]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[01:58:58.855 --> 01:59:03.938]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[01:59:03.938 --> 01:59:09.501]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[01:59:09.501 --> 01:59:12.742]  Not worried about them moving south.
[01:59:12.742 --> 01:59:16.645]  Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[01:59:19.296 --> 01:59:24.801]  I'm looking for America.
[01:59:24.801 --> 01:59:26.442]  Wear American and be proud.
[01:59:26.442 --> 01:59:29.044]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[01:59:29.044 --> 01:59:33.568]  The land I left free and the home of the brave.
[01:59:33.568 --> 01:59:37.411]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[01:59:45.231 --> 01:59:53.696]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[01:59:53.696 --> 01:59:56.078]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.078 --> 01:59:58.860]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.441 --> 02:00:10.285]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.285 --> 02:00:11.866]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.866 --> 02:00:13.147]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.147 --> 02:00:17.611]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.611 --> 02:00:21.675]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:32.631 --> 02:00:37.792]  Now into hour number three, talking to Max Keiser, who is on fire.
[02:00:37.792 --> 02:00:54.736]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is a mathematical certainty every economist we've had on for more than 12 years, from George Humphrey right through to Webster Tarpley, has broken down that once they launch derivatives, it's a mathematical certainty that if the bankers can tie us to their fraudulent debt, it's over.
[02:00:55.316 --> 02:01:04.722]  And they've tied the dollar to it and now they're reorganizing this new global SDR basket based in a new fiat system they control so they can buy up the planet through fraud.
[02:01:05.580 --> 02:01:05.660]  It's
[02:01:26.670 --> 02:01:30.312]  The average American still doesn't understand that the Federal Reserve is the enemy.
[02:01:30.312 --> 02:01:45.178]  Though we've gone from Ron Paul having one co-sponsor to being able to pass his audit to Fed in the House, and though Gallup polls and others show over 80% do want to abolish it, people need to understand this is the number one issue.
[02:01:45.178 --> 02:01:49.560]  People of Cairo, cross check, bargain and buy silver!
[02:01:49.560 --> 02:01:51.101]  People of Cairo, listen to me!
[02:01:52.496 --> 02:01:57.399]  Sorry Alex, I was just trying to get my part of the revolution started.
[02:01:57.399 --> 02:02:03.964]  Yeah, listen, I was just listening to that commercial for Diamond Gusset Jeans about some people down in America crying.
[02:02:03.964 --> 02:02:05.465]  Woohoo!
[02:02:05.465 --> 02:02:07.246]  America's finished!
[02:02:07.566 --> 02:02:12.628]  Meanwhile, the people in Cairo are dancing in the streets because they just staged a successful revolution!
[02:02:12.628 --> 02:02:13.528]  They're dancing here!
[02:02:13.528 --> 02:02:14.368]  They're happy!
[02:02:14.368 --> 02:02:18.490]  They're full of pride and integrity that they overthrew a dictator!
[02:02:18.490 --> 02:02:19.650]  Stop crying!
[02:02:19.650 --> 02:02:20.811]  Stop whining!
[02:02:20.811 --> 02:02:22.911]  Stop being a big frickin' baby!
[02:02:22.911 --> 02:02:23.792]  Revolt!
[02:02:23.792 --> 02:02:25.072]  You must revolt now!
[02:02:25.072 --> 02:02:26.873]  Or you're gonna be in prison!
[02:02:26.873 --> 02:02:28.694]  In the prison planet!
[02:02:28.694 --> 02:02:29.594]  You must do it now!
[02:02:31.799 --> 02:02:32.922]  You're calling for revolt.
[02:02:32.922 --> 02:02:37.899]  You mean peaceful mass demonstration, kind of like what they're doing in Wisconsin, taking over the Capitol?
[02:02:39.380 --> 02:02:41.341]  Well, Wisconsin's a great example to people.
[02:02:41.341 --> 02:02:54.310]  I think the people in Wisconsin don't fully understand the issues that are at stake because they're defining their issues in that fake left-wing paradigm that you talk about all the time.
[02:02:54.310 --> 02:03:07.779]  I think they need to understand that everyone in Wisconsin's a loser if Scott Walker, who's a representative of the banking kleptocracy and the Koch brothers kleptocracy, if he wins, everybody loses.
[02:03:07.779 --> 02:03:08.820]  Nobody wins if he wins.
[02:03:09.540 --> 02:03:11.402]  They have to understand that mentality.
[02:03:11.402 --> 02:03:14.904]  Their right to march on the Capitol building, 70,000 people did.
[02:03:14.904 --> 02:03:16.425]  That's spreading to Ohio.
[02:03:16.425 --> 02:03:18.367]  I say from Ohio to Cairo.
[02:03:18.367 --> 02:03:21.930]  From Ohio to Cairo, let freedom reign.
[02:03:21.930 --> 02:03:23.771]  It's a peaceful revolution we saw here.
[02:03:23.771 --> 02:03:26.193]  You don't need to be violently uprising.
[02:03:26.193 --> 02:03:27.554]  You don't even need a leader.
[02:03:27.554 --> 02:03:29.015]  All you need is an idea.
[02:03:29.015 --> 02:03:32.638]  Let that idea percolate on the social networks and act on that idea.
[02:03:32.938 --> 02:03:35.421]  Literally, it happened overnight here, Alex, in Cairo.
[02:03:35.421 --> 02:03:37.784]  I was talking to a guy, interviewed him for my show today.
[02:03:37.784 --> 02:03:45.333]  He said, one day, we were playing video games on the internet and didn't think at all about this movement or this revolution.
[02:03:45.333 --> 02:03:47.715]  And within one day, it just sparked.
[02:03:47.715 --> 02:03:48.376]  Within a day.
[02:03:48.376 --> 02:03:52.161]  The next day, they were in Tahrir Square, a million strong.
[02:03:52.161 --> 02:03:53.202]  It happened that quickly.
[02:03:53.602 --> 02:04:02.067]  Because all it takes is an idea now, and the social networking is able to give the voice an action, and it can happen quickly.
[02:04:02.067 --> 02:04:08.151]  So my, again, it was Madison, Wisconsin, Ohio, are all these states in America that are going bankrupt.
[02:04:08.151 --> 02:04:10.272]  People are imposing austerity measures.
[02:04:10.272 --> 02:04:15.595]  The bankers want Americans to eat the austerity measures for the mistakes that they made.
[02:04:15.595 --> 02:04:16.676]  Max, we're out of time.
[02:04:16.676 --> 02:04:17.697]  Max, we're out of time.
[02:04:17.697 --> 02:04:20.038]  We appreciate you reporting from the Middle East for us.
[02:04:20.038 --> 02:04:21.079]  Where are you headed next?
[02:04:22.986 --> 02:04:26.369]  I might be going back to Paris or I might be going to Oman.
[02:04:26.369 --> 02:04:26.869]  I'm not sure.
[02:04:26.869 --> 02:04:28.270]  I'll know more tomorrow.
[02:04:28.270 --> 02:04:33.454]  Well, if you do that, we want to have you pop back in this week, even if it's Sunday from the 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:04:33.454 --> 02:04:33.774]  program.
[02:04:33.774 --> 02:04:35.935]  It'll be like midnight your time.
[02:04:35.935 --> 02:04:38.137]  But Max, we really appreciate you joining us.
[02:04:38.137 --> 02:04:40.439]  Is this not Buck Rogers science fiction?
[02:04:40.439 --> 02:04:42.380]  He's on a rooftop over the Nile.
[02:04:42.740 --> 02:04:48.309]  Talking to us live time from 8,000, 9,000 miles away from Cairo, Egypt.
[02:04:48.309 --> 02:04:51.955]  And we're here in Austin, Texas, bouncing off satellites all over the world.
[02:04:51.955 --> 02:04:53.879]  Max Keiser, always great hearing from you.
[02:04:53.879 --> 02:04:55.301]  We'll talk to you again very soon.
[02:04:55.301 --> 02:04:56.343]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:56.343 --> 02:04:56.883]  Stay with us.
[02:05:00.728 --> 02:05:05.271]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:05:05.271 --> 02:05:06.191]  Number 1.
[02:05:06.191 --> 02:05:09.614]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:09.614 --> 02:05:10.474]  Number 2.
[02:05:10.474 --> 02:05:15.357]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:05:15.357 --> 02:05:16.098]  It's true.
[02:05:16.098 --> 02:05:20.981]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:20.981 --> 02:05:21.801]  Number 3.
[02:05:21.801 --> 02:05:25.384]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:05:25.384 --> 02:05:29.086]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:05:29.286 --> 02:05:30.086]  Number 4.
[02:05:30.086 --> 02:05:32.848]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:05:32.848 --> 02:05:36.529]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:05:36.529 --> 02:05:37.309]  Number 5.
[02:05:37.309 --> 02:05:41.471]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:05:41.471 --> 02:05:46.513]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:05:57.398 --> 02:05:58.339]  877-327-0365.
[02:05:58.339 --> 02:06:02.302]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:06:02.302 --> 02:06:05.664]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.

[02:06:21.977 --> 02:06:24.620]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[02:06:24.620 --> 02:06:31.145]  Since 1947, Calvin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.

[02:06:55.402 --> 02:06:55.862]  Thank you!
[02:07:01.545 --> 02:07:05.549]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:07:05.549 --> 02:07:08.812]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:07:08.812 --> 02:07:13.596]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:07:13.596 --> 02:07:20.002]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:07:20.002 --> 02:07:22.225]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:07:22.765 --> 02:07:23.065]  Tim Geithner?
[02:07:23.065 --> 02:07:23.586]  Bernanke?
[02:07:23.586 --> 02:07:24.246]  They're arsonists!
[02:07:24.246 --> 02:07:25.527]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:07:25.527 --> 02:07:27.768]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:07:41.676 --> 02:07:43.797]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:07:43.797 --> 02:07:48.939]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:07:48.939 --> 02:07:58.123]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:07:58.123 --> 02:08:00.004]  We can't fight City Hall.
[02:08:08.480 --> 02:08:10.622]  Don't talk about politics or religion.
[02:08:10.622 --> 02:08:14.924]  This is all the equivalent of enemy propaganda rolling across the picket line.
[02:08:14.924 --> 02:08:16.005]  Lay down, G.I.
[02:08:16.005 --> 02:08:17.226]  Lay down, G.I.
[02:08:17.226 --> 02:08:19.247]  We saw it all through the 20th century.
[02:08:19.247 --> 02:08:25.811]  And now in the 21st century, it's time to stand up and realize that we should not allow ourselves to be crammed into this rat maze.
[02:08:25.811 --> 02:08:28.253]  We should not submit to dehumanization.
[02:08:28.633 --> 02:08:32.257]  I don't know about you, but I'm concerned with what's happening in this world.
[02:08:32.257 --> 02:08:33.998]  I'm concerned with the structure.
[02:08:33.998 --> 02:08:36.240]  I'm concerned with the systems of control.
[02:08:36.240 --> 02:08:40.684]  Those that control my life, and those that seek to control it even more!
[02:08:40.684 --> 02:08:41.705]  I want freedom!
[02:08:41.705 --> 02:08:44.048]  That's what I want, and that's what Jason wants!
[02:08:44.588 --> 02:08:52.934]  It's up to each and every one of us to turn loose just some of the greed, the hatred, the envy, and yes, the insecurities, because that is the central mode of control.
[02:08:52.934 --> 02:09:00.158]  Make us feel pathetic, small, so we'll willingly give up our sovereignty, our liberty, our destiny.
[02:09:00.158 --> 02:09:04.682]  We have got to realize that we're being conditioned on a mass scale.
[02:09:04.682 --> 02:09:07.423]  Start challenging this corporate slave state.
[02:09:07.423 --> 02:09:14.348]  The 21st century is going to be a new century, not the century of slavery, not the century of lies and even those of significance.
[02:09:15.789 --> 02:09:19.251]  Classism, statism, and all the rest of the modes of control.
[02:09:19.251 --> 02:09:24.054]  It's gonna be the age of humankind standing up for something pure and something right.
[02:09:24.054 --> 02:09:24.915]  What a bunch of garbage.
[02:09:24.915 --> 02:09:28.137]  Liberal, Democrat, Conservative, Republican.
[02:09:28.137 --> 02:09:29.898]  It's all there to control you.
[02:09:29.898 --> 02:09:31.519]  Two sides of the same coin.
[02:09:31.519 --> 02:09:36.982]  Two management teams getting for control the CEO job of Slavery Incorporated.
[02:09:36.982 --> 02:09:39.784]  The truth is out there in front of you that they lay out this bucket
[02:09:39.984 --> 02:09:40.944]  I'm sick of it!
[02:09:40.944 --> 02:09:43.745]  And I'm not going to take a bite out of it!
[02:09:43.745 --> 02:09:45.005]  Do you got me?
[02:09:45.005 --> 02:09:46.526]  Humankind is too good!
[02:09:46.526 --> 02:09:49.227]  We're not a bunch of underachievers!
[02:09:49.227 --> 02:09:52.587]  We're going to stand up and we're going to be human beings!
[02:09:52.587 --> 02:09:56.509]  We're going to be fighting for the real things!
[02:09:56.509 --> 02:09:57.909]  The things that matter!
[02:09:57.909 --> 02:09:58.669]  Creativity!
[02:09:58.669 --> 02:10:02.870]  And the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit!
[02:10:02.870 --> 02:10:03.430]  Well that's it!
[02:10:03.430 --> 02:10:04.571]  That's all I've got to say!
[02:10:04.571 --> 02:10:05.371]  Continue your court!
[02:10:13.052 --> 02:10:19.332]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:10:26.997 --> 02:10:28.979]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:10:28.979 --> 02:10:29.839]  to 2 p.m.
[02:10:29.839 --> 02:10:32.802]  Central Standard Time, we are here live.
[02:10:32.802 --> 02:10:39.627]  And I tell you, I knew about him as being one of the most powerful sluggers ever in baseball.
[02:10:39.627 --> 02:10:47.494]  And I'd also seen him in the news a few years ago as, you know, this fabulous investor and a lot of analysts saying he was the best out there for an individual.
[02:10:47.494 --> 02:10:53.218]  Then I saw the supposed fall of Lenny Dykstra, like so many other companies that the banks basically manipulated and cheated.
[02:10:53.999 --> 02:11:00.065]  And I had a chance to spend a lot of time with him when I was out in Los Angeles a few weeks ago and he was on with us for that epic
[02:11:01.357 --> 02:11:07.982]  Off the charts, off the rails interview with Charlie Sheen last week that Lenny or I did not know was going to happen.
[02:11:07.982 --> 02:11:11.305]  We were going to get Charlie on to talk about how he was clean.
[02:11:11.305 --> 02:11:17.870]  We witnessed him with the nurse there doing the urine test, blood test, you name it, how proud of him we were.
[02:11:17.870 --> 02:11:22.674]  But he was mad about some of the executives demonizing him and attacking him while he was down.
[02:11:22.674 --> 02:11:25.216]  And it's obviously the biggest story in the world right now.
[02:11:25.216 --> 02:11:28.439]  And without getting into any details, we had a nice hour and a half.
[02:11:29.437 --> 02:11:54.008]  Discussion with Charlie Sheen and Lenny via Charlie's office last night the media keeps asking me to comment on Charlie I haven't been or give them inside information I have all the inside information because I don't talk about it Charlie is my friend I know him as a loving compassionate really smart guy who's been totally clean for the previous six plus years I knew him went off the rails a little bit got wild now He's got the endorphins flowing
[02:11:54.848 --> 02:11:56.229]  The media calls it mania.
[02:11:56.229 --> 02:12:01.371]  I call it normal when you kick, you know, serious substance use by yourself.
[02:12:01.371 --> 02:12:03.332]  No prescription drugs, no nothing.
[02:12:03.332 --> 02:12:06.313]  He's off everything except life.
[02:12:06.313 --> 02:12:11.976]  But I wanted to originally get Lenny on, but then we got into the Sheen thing because he was going to be part two of the interview.
[02:12:12.956 --> 02:12:27.630]  Dealing with the fact that I remember four or five months ago hearing everybody in the community and lawyers and that were in the Wall Street Journal and USA Today that we got on who were beating banks in Florida and Connecticut and New York and California.
[02:12:27.630 --> 02:12:31.434]  They were mentioning Lenny Dykstra and the big case with JP Morgan.
[02:12:32.074 --> 02:12:32.194]  And
[02:12:53.309 --> 02:13:19.181]  Five in the afternoon or whatever until two three in the morning when he left and Really came off as a very interesting and genuine person and Lenny was blown away because for about two hours We sat around Charlie's Kitchen Island Standing up looking at his court cases looking at his 200-plus wins against the SEC which nobody's ever done I mean Mark Cuban beat him once and they came back at him and seeing
[02:13:20.101 --> 02:13:20.381]  Yeah.
[02:13:35.996 --> 02:13:40.098]  I wanted to get Lenny on specifically about that today.
[02:13:40.098 --> 02:14:03.272]  Of course, for those that don't know who Lenny Dykstra is, he's not only an entrepreneur, he was a three-time Most Valuable All-Star Selection World Series Champion 1986, the Silver Slugger winner 1993, known in the baseball sites that I've looked at as one of the hardest players ever.
[02:14:03.892 --> 02:14:04.313]  That's right.
[02:14:22.051 --> 02:14:23.293]  You're an amazing guy, Lenny.
[02:14:23.293 --> 02:14:28.621]  I mean, I don't get on there and tell folks I like somebody unless I really, as George Bush would say, look into their soul.
[02:14:28.621 --> 02:14:33.288]  But you are an awesome guy and an awesome friend to Charlie, and now I count you as a friend.
[02:14:33.288 --> 02:14:35.051]  We now talk every day on the phone.
[02:14:35.051 --> 02:14:36.533]  I mean, where were you my whole life, Lenny?
[02:14:38.132 --> 02:14:42.197]  Well, I'm glad to be on the winning team now.
[02:14:42.197 --> 02:14:53.309]  Well, I'm actually always on the winning team, but hey, listen, I appreciate you having me on, and again, all the things that you did say about Charlie Sheen are correct.
[02:14:53.309 --> 02:14:56.012]  Charlie Sheen is an amazing person.
[02:14:57.443 --> 02:15:08.209]  He's an individual that speaks the truth and now hopefully things will come full circle and all the fans will get what they want and that is to see Charlie.
[02:15:08.209 --> 02:15:09.549]  Let's not forget what this is about.
[02:15:09.549 --> 02:15:25.558]  This is about him entertaining this country with his talent and then he's one of the best or probably the best at what he does right now and so I think they're all smart enough to realize that and this will hopefully all have a happy ending here and that's what America wants and that's what America deserves.
[02:15:26.175 --> 02:15:34.491]  Yeah, I don't want to say too much, but there may be some really positive row-ending events coming up very soon.
[02:15:35.646 --> 02:15:36.786]  Yeah, possibly could.
[02:15:36.786 --> 02:15:48.570]  You know, I mean, look, Charlie right now is a guy that is probably the single hottest human on the planet.
[02:15:48.570 --> 02:15:55.672]  I mean, I think he started a Twitter account, which I think was your idea, by the way, Alex.
[02:15:55.672 --> 02:16:00.934]  And I think he went through the rails and then hit over a million people on his first day out.
[02:16:00.934 --> 02:16:03.395]  Yeah, it's a million and a half right now in a day and a half.
[02:16:03.855 --> 02:16:04.376]  Yeah.
[02:16:04.376 --> 02:16:10.921]  So Alex, that means you should be in the Guinness Book with him because that was your idea.
[02:16:10.921 --> 02:16:17.327]  So anyways, I'm waiting for ideas from you to tell me how to get a Guinness Book of World Records.
[02:16:27.399 --> 02:16:28.819]  People want to hear about Charlie a little bit.
[02:16:28.819 --> 02:16:52.935]  We're going to go to break here in a minute and then finish talking about that and get into your, you've got a great old website showing in the last year your defeat of JP Morgan, your defeat of the SEC, the actual documents, you're opening your life up to everybody, you're showing people how that you beat them, and it's exactly what other lawyers I've had on who've been beating them have said, and that's what's really, you're at the heart of causing MortgageGate.
[02:16:53.695 --> 02:16:55.636]  Where they set you up, you're now exposing it.
[02:16:55.636 --> 02:16:56.537]  We're going to talk about that.
[02:16:56.537 --> 02:17:07.784]  But without getting into too much about what we talked about last night with Charlie, that hour and a half discussion, when I knew him, he was focused, smart, but now he really is unchained.
[02:17:07.784 --> 02:17:11.166]  And he mainly jokes around in those interviews and people take it serious.
[02:17:11.166 --> 02:17:14.268]  But in person last night, he was like a laser beam.
[02:17:14.268 --> 02:17:17.470]  And every idea we had, he was already a couple of steps past us.
[02:17:20.612 --> 02:17:23.716]  Again folks, obviously we just can't talk about it.
[02:17:23.716 --> 02:17:29.364]  We know basically everything but we can't talk about it and I wish we could but we're gonna see what happens.
[02:17:29.364 --> 02:17:29.805]  Sounds good.
[02:17:30.661 --> 02:17:32.563]  I mean, is there anything we can talk about?
[02:17:32.563 --> 02:17:41.091]  I guess we really shouldn't... Well, I mean, look, the only thing we can talk about is, the first thing is, I got hit by a lot of pitches, but not that many, so let me name my website.
[02:17:41.091 --> 02:17:45.154]  It's StopTheGreedyBanks.com.
[02:17:45.154 --> 02:17:51.060]  And then, so everybody can kind of know, last time I was on the domain, it was a little bit different.
[02:17:51.520 --> 02:17:59.165]  So, again, Alex helped me again, and that's, again, StopTheGreedyBanks.com.
[02:17:59.165 --> 02:18:02.067]  But the bottom line is, with Charvy, here's the deal.
[02:18:02.067 --> 02:18:03.908]  The deal is this.
[02:18:03.908 --> 02:18:04.709]  At the end of the day,
[02:18:06.213 --> 02:18:08.376]  Somebody's got to win and somebody's got to lose.
[02:18:08.376 --> 02:18:11.399]  So, so, Charlie talks about winning all the time.
[02:18:11.399 --> 02:18:12.440]  He's a winner.
[02:18:12.440 --> 02:18:14.462]  So, so, that's what's going to happen.
[02:18:14.462 --> 02:18:20.048]  That's the only thing I can tell you that's going to happen, is that if he wins, then America wins, okay?
[02:18:20.048 --> 02:18:28.357]  And the bottom line is, like you said, Alex, I mean, you had him on the show and, you know, Charlie wanted to say his piece and he did.
[02:18:29.057 --> 02:18:31.560]  But again, now everything's kind of full circle.
[02:18:31.560 --> 02:18:32.821]  It's time to get back to work.
[02:18:32.821 --> 02:18:36.164]  And I think Charlie's smart enough to realize that.
[02:18:36.164 --> 02:18:39.647]  In fact, I know he's smart enough because I was with him all day yesterday.
[02:18:39.647 --> 02:18:43.811]  And he's a genuine, dear friend, not only to me, but to you.
[02:18:43.811 --> 02:18:48.756]  And he's the kind of friend that you can count on your hand if you don't have any of those that are loyal.
[02:18:49.336 --> 02:19:00.744]  So anyway, without further ado, I'd like to go to your break, but I'll just point out again, there should be some positive stuff happening here in the future, very near future, in fact.
[02:19:00.744 --> 02:19:01.904]  And why wouldn't there be?
[02:19:01.904 --> 02:19:05.667]  I mean, it's a win-win for everybody, and at the end of the day, that's what it all about.
[02:19:05.667 --> 02:19:07.028]  The results are what matters.
[02:19:07.028 --> 02:19:08.609]  Winning, okay, that's what the key is.
[02:19:09.246 --> 02:19:12.908]  Well, plus he stood up against the whole Hollywood system.
[02:19:12.908 --> 02:19:16.931]  And if he loses, it hurts everybody standing up against this system.
[02:19:16.931 --> 02:19:21.974]  There are a lot of other big Hollywood people thinking about going political and coming out of their shells.
[02:19:21.974 --> 02:19:24.455]  And so a lot is riding on this.
[02:19:24.455 --> 02:19:26.517]  But I want to get back to your website.
[02:19:26.517 --> 02:19:28.898]  And we're going to put it up on screen as we go to break.
[02:19:28.898 --> 02:19:30.479]  It's a beautiful website.
[02:19:30.479 --> 02:19:31.260]  The information.
[02:19:32.060 --> 02:19:38.225]  Is all of your cases, the documentation, the court cases, all laid out for everybody.
[02:19:38.225 --> 02:19:42.168]  And the website is StopTheGreedyBanks.com.
[02:19:42.168 --> 02:19:46.112]  That's StopTheGreedyBanks.com.
[02:19:46.112 --> 02:19:54.939]  Go see the proof of Lenny, also known as Nails, defeating JP Morgan, defeating it for everybody out there with these predatory lenders.
[02:19:54.939 --> 02:19:55.880]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.

[02:21:00.891 --> 02:21:02.413]  America, you've been warned.
[02:21:10.060 --> 02:21:13.242]  I told you about the video that details this shocking prediction.
[02:21:13.242 --> 02:21:16.923]  So far, over 6 million people have watched this free video online.
[02:21:16.923 --> 02:21:17.724]  Have you?
[02:21:17.724 --> 02:21:29.030]  Again, this big event has nothing to do with war or the stock market, yet it could change everything about your normal way of life, the way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your family.
[02:21:29.030 --> 02:21:30.210]  Could this really happen?
[02:21:30.210 --> 02:21:34.192]  Well, the man who created this video has been right about many predictions in his career.
[02:21:34.192 --> 02:21:39.735]  He was among the first to predict the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth

[02:22:00.613 --> 02:22:01.394]  Gold.
[02:22:01.394 --> 02:22:02.935]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[02:22:02.935 --> 02:22:09.221]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:22:09.221 --> 02:22:13.405]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:22:13.405 --> 02:22:15.347]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:22:15.347 --> 02:22:17.769]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:22:17.769 --> 02:22:25.196]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[02:22:25.196 --> 02:22:34.918]  Today, Midas Resources is proud to offer the hard-hitting report that arms you with the truth you need to protect you and your family from the Fed's plans for your hard-earned money.

[02:22:52.602 --> 02:23:01.246]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:23:01.246 --> 02:23:06.828]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:23:06.828 --> 02:23:11.850]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:23:11.850 --> 02:23:16.872]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:23:17.412 --> 02:23:22.638]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:23:22.638 --> 02:23:29.766]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:23:29.766 --> 02:23:30.888]  And here's the best part.
[02:23:30.888 --> 02:23:37.235]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:23:37.555 --> 02:23:40.736]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:23:40.736 --> 02:23:42.957]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[02:23:42.957 --> 02:23:43.838]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:23:43.838 --> 02:23:44.098]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:23:44.098 --> 02:23:47.539]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:23:47.539 --> 02:23:49.260]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:24:07.231 --> 02:24:13.792]  For many of you who may not know who Lenny Dykstra is, the website StopTheGreedyBanks.com.
[02:24:13.792 --> 02:24:16.173]  One word, StopTheGreedyBanks.com.
[02:24:16.173 --> 02:24:22.235]  We'll put it up on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, so they can see the URL as well, or they can call 807-325-7000.
[02:24:23.875 --> 02:24:24.356]  I think?
[02:24:39.056 --> 02:24:55.343]  Charlie and I and you for two hours of that eight-hour meeting or whatever it was, they're going over all your documents, the mirrors, the fraudulent filings, the scam that is the bankruptcy courts, how they changed your bankruptcy, what they're doing to millions of Americans.
[02:24:55.343 --> 02:25:00.105]  But first, here's Lenny a few years ago before the banks shut him down.
[02:25:00.105 --> 02:25:06.527]  Here's what the National News and Jim Cramer had to say about his stock picks, which the scoreboard doesn't lie.
[02:25:06.527 --> 02:25:07.648]  He was making great picks.
[02:25:07.648 --> 02:25:07.988]  Here it is.
[02:25:09.525 --> 02:25:19.567]  And just in case you're thinking that nobody who sounds like Yogi Berra can be that successful in the world of high finance, don't take my word for it.
[02:25:19.567 --> 02:25:28.890]  I think people don't think of Lenny as sophisticated, but I am telling you, Bernie, that not only is he sophisticated, but he's one of the great ones in this business.
[02:25:28.890 --> 02:25:30.550]  He's one of the great ones.
[02:25:30.550 --> 02:25:31.250]  Lenny Dykstra.
[02:25:31.250 --> 02:25:32.931]  Lenny Dykstra.
[02:25:32.931 --> 02:25:33.571]  Lenny Dykstra.
[02:25:35.652 --> 02:25:36.772]  Lenny Dykstra.
[02:25:36.772 --> 02:25:37.392]  I know.
[02:25:37.392 --> 02:25:37.852]  I know.
[02:25:37.852 --> 02:25:38.753]  It's like Lenny Dykstra.
[02:25:38.753 --> 02:25:39.773]  Now, come on, Jim.
[02:25:39.773 --> 02:25:40.473]  Lenny Dykstra.
[02:25:40.473 --> 02:25:41.513]  Yeah.
[02:25:41.513 --> 02:25:42.713]  Welcome to Mad Money!
[02:25:42.713 --> 02:25:43.934]  Welcome to Crain Market!
[02:25:43.934 --> 02:25:45.094]  All right, folks.
[02:25:45.094 --> 02:25:46.854]  So we've got a few minutes here before we've got a break.
[02:25:46.854 --> 02:25:47.594]  Long segment coming up.
[02:25:47.594 --> 02:25:50.975]  But, Lenny, break down what happened to you in a nutshell.
[02:25:50.975 --> 02:25:53.136]  Then we'll go into more detail what the banks did to you.
[02:25:53.136 --> 02:25:59.877]  And then when we come back, you're the underdog, came from nowhere as this top slugger, underdog, doing great in the stock market.
[02:25:59.877 --> 02:26:01.297]  Then they shut you down.
[02:26:01.297 --> 02:26:05.098]  Now you're back beating them in court, the underdog winning again, rising like the phoenix.
[02:26:06.018 --> 02:26:08.520]  Well, let me just make something clear.
[02:26:08.520 --> 02:26:11.141]  Jim Cramer is the only one that's been right.
[02:26:11.141 --> 02:26:13.042]  By the way, I'm still going.
[02:26:13.042 --> 02:26:18.846]  My NailsInvestments.com, I'm now 205 and 0, okay?
[02:26:18.846 --> 02:26:26.630]  That website, that company that I have where I help people make money through sock picks is still going today, okay?
[02:26:26.630 --> 02:26:28.912]  I didn't get stupid overnight, okay?
[02:26:28.912 --> 02:26:30.593]  Bottom line is, I got
[02:26:31.393 --> 02:26:36.115]  I got put in a situation where I was set up to fail by JP Morgan, okay?
[02:26:36.115 --> 02:26:42.977]  And at the end of the day, when they want you to fail, it's called equity stripping, it's called predatory lending, whatever you want to call it.
[02:26:42.977 --> 02:26:44.798]  You can't beat them, okay?
[02:26:44.798 --> 02:26:46.739]  I didn't get stupid overnight, okay?
[02:26:46.739 --> 02:26:47.939]  I did not get stupid overnight.
[02:26:47.939 --> 02:26:52.000]  When they promise you one thing and do another, then that's a problem.
[02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:55.602]  Well, in a nutshell, describe how you went from the top of the world to being in trouble.
[02:26:55.602 --> 02:26:56.102]  Now you're back.
[02:26:56.681 --> 02:26:58.383]  It's very simple.
[02:26:58.383 --> 02:27:10.660]  When they tell me, here's the deal, let me in a nutshell, I tell them I have $125,000 a month coming in from cash flow that I sold my car washes and had a 10-year cash flow of $300,000.
[02:27:10.660 --> 02:27:12.823]  You made $54 million off the car washes!
[02:27:13.443 --> 02:27:13.984]  Right, right.
[02:27:13.984 --> 02:27:17.428]  I was carrying some paper and I took some interest on a note to pay me $125,000 a month.
[02:27:17.428 --> 02:27:22.413]  And then again, not that smart of a guy, but smart enough to know if I got $125,000 and I tell him I got a $50,000 nut on one house, there's $75,000 left.
[02:27:28.260 --> 02:27:29.862]  Well, I don't want to go up to that $75,000.
[02:27:29.862 --> 02:27:37.329]  I want to tell them if you bring me a loan back for $49,000 as a payment, no money down, then we can do business.
[02:27:37.329 --> 02:27:38.090]  Well, guess what?
[02:27:38.090 --> 02:27:39.031]  I shut up at escrow.
[02:27:39.031 --> 02:27:40.733]  They change all the deals.
[02:27:40.733 --> 02:27:42.494]  They tell me how they're going to refi me.
[02:27:42.494 --> 02:27:43.175]  The same stuff.
[02:27:43.175 --> 02:27:44.556]  People don't want to hear long stories.
[02:27:44.556 --> 02:27:48.741]  The bottom line is... No, people need to hear how they do it, because you've now beaten them in court.
[02:27:48.741 --> 02:27:49.581]  Well, here's how they do it.
[02:27:50.382 --> 02:27:51.883]  They set you up to fail.
[02:27:51.883 --> 02:27:55.126]  It's called predatory lending at its finest.
[02:27:55.126 --> 02:28:03.552]  It's gone so far now that I now can show people, I can show the American families out there that are walking around in impending doom.
[02:28:03.552 --> 02:28:08.075]  I mean, if anybody, all the people out there listening, I know what they feel like.
[02:28:08.075 --> 02:28:12.038]  I know what it's like when you're walking around with nowhere to turn, nowhere to go.
[02:28:12.438 --> 02:28:13.799]  Well, I now have a solution.
[02:28:13.799 --> 02:28:20.861]  I now have a remedy where you can go in and seek recruitment and lessen the defeat by these bankers.
[02:28:20.861 --> 02:28:24.262]  Because once they file a proof of claim, you now are on defense.
[02:28:24.262 --> 02:28:26.003]  They take the offensive mode.
[02:28:26.003 --> 02:28:32.785]  And the bottom line is, through TILA, through RESPA, and HOPA, the bottom line is it's very simple.
[02:28:32.785 --> 02:28:33.805]  They're set off claims.
[02:28:33.805 --> 02:28:39.547]  If they didn't do everything right, if they didn't qualify you under federal law, they have a fiduciary duty to do so.
[02:28:39.547 --> 02:28:41.108]  If they didn't do everything perfect,
[02:28:41.488 --> 02:28:50.465]  And you have claims and you have real options to get your house back or to get less of the fee and recover money.
[02:28:50.465 --> 02:28:50.886]  Period.
[02:28:50.886 --> 02:28:51.427]  End of story.
[02:28:53.325 --> 02:29:02.730]  And we're going to walk through that when we come back from break because on your website StopTheGreedyBanks.com, one word, StopTheGreedyBanks.com, I spent hours and hours when I got back.
[02:29:02.730 --> 02:29:05.191]  You've got all the court cases, the documents.
[02:29:05.191 --> 02:29:09.914]  We're going to break here in a moment, but tell them about the latest case where you beat J.P.
[02:29:09.914 --> 02:29:13.296]  Morgan, showing how they didn't do things right in the loan.
[02:29:13.296 --> 02:29:14.476]  Well, I mean, with J.P.
[02:29:14.476 --> 02:29:15.597]  Morgan, I have a great attorney.
[02:29:15.597 --> 02:29:16.577]  His name is Moshe Morton.
[02:29:16.577 --> 02:29:17.658]  They're out of New York.
[02:29:18.582 --> 02:29:26.427]  And he's one of the attorneys that what we do is once we find that the loan's predatory, okay, we send him up to the attorneys.
[02:29:26.427 --> 02:29:27.348]  And here's the deal.
[02:29:27.348 --> 02:29:31.691]  At the end of the day, the banks do not want to foreclose on homes.
[02:29:31.691 --> 02:29:32.732]  You know why?
[02:29:32.732 --> 02:29:34.373]  They get reimbursed anyway.
[02:29:34.373 --> 02:29:40.116]  So at the end of the day, what we want to do is show people how they can get their homes safe.
[02:29:40.116 --> 02:29:40.877]  We can save people's homes.
[02:29:40.877 --> 02:29:41.617]  All right, stay there.
[02:29:41.617 --> 02:29:44.559]  Let's talk about your specific case beating him, though, because it's on record now.
[02:29:44.559 --> 02:29:46.020]  It's been in the LA Times.
[02:29:46.020 --> 02:29:47.341]  And then let's look at you beating the SEC.
[02:29:48.642 --> 02:29:49.463]  Nails is our guest.
[02:29:49.463 --> 02:29:51.124]  Stay with us.
[02:29:51.124 --> 02:29:52.525]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.525 --> 02:29:55.046]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.046 --> 02:29:57.728]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.201 --> 02:30:04.784]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[02:30:04.784 --> 02:30:06.085]  It ended on June of 2009.
[02:30:06.085 --> 02:30:10.489]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[02:30:10.489 --> 02:30:16.435]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[02:30:16.435 --> 02:30:18.576]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[02:30:18.576 --> 02:30:21.259]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[02:30:21.599 --> 02:30:28.104]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[02:30:28.104 --> 02:30:30.306]  They both make fabulous investments.
[02:30:30.306 --> 02:30:35.650]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[02:30:35.650 --> 02:30:40.614]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[02:30:40.934 --> 02:30:46.299]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious easy fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[02:30:46.299 --> 02:30:49.503]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[02:30:49.503 --> 02:30:52.505]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[02:30:52.505 --> 02:30:53.266]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[02:31:00.573 --> 02:31:01.734]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:31:01.734 --> 02:31:08.659]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:31:08.659 --> 02:31:11.221]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:31:11.221 --> 02:31:16.605]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:31:16.605 --> 02:31:19.647]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:31:19.647 --> 02:31:21.709]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:31:21.949 --> 02:31:28.214]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:31:28.214 --> 02:31:31.576]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:31:31.576 --> 02:31:37.360]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:31:37.360 --> 02:31:39.001]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:31:39.001 --> 02:31:40.302]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:31:40.302 --> 02:31:42.824]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:31:42.964 --> 02:31:47.190]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:31:47.190 --> 02:31:51.816]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:31:51.816 --> 02:31:54.420]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[02:31:54.420 --> 02:31:57.424]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:31:57.424 --> 02:31:58.045]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:32:00.248 --> 02:32:04.430]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:32:04.430 --> 02:32:10.832]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:32:10.832 --> 02:32:18.214]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:32:18.214 --> 02:32:23.096]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[02:32:23.096 --> 02:32:25.237]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.
[02:32:28.038 --> 02:32:31.766]  Or see them online at FiveStarSoap.com or InfoWars.com.
[02:32:31.766 --> 02:32:35.493]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[02:32:36.027 --> 02:32:42.790]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[02:32:42.790 --> 02:32:46.672]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[02:32:46.672 --> 02:32:53.055]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[02:32:53.055 --> 02:32:54.255]  Thank you.
[02:33:02.779 --> 02:33:08.812]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[02:33:08.812 --> 02:33:11.357]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:16.991 --> 02:33:35.896]  Well, you can check out his predatory lending recovery website and give him a call at 800-728-4981 or the website StopTheGreedyBanks.com and the information on the site is what all the lawyers and experts that we've had on the show, Randy Kelton, who's a pro se litigant like Nails,
[02:33:36.576 --> 02:33:37.197]  I don't think so.
[02:33:59.326 --> 02:34:01.266]  Well, here it is.
[02:34:01.266 --> 02:34:06.247]  It's really, really something that, again, I'm a normal guy.
[02:34:06.247 --> 02:34:07.928]  Okay, I played baseball.
[02:34:07.928 --> 02:34:12.709]  By the grace of God, I was able to hit a ball where people weren't standing and make millions of dollars.
[02:34:12.709 --> 02:34:22.951]  That being said, I was able to carry that over and understand that once you're done playing, if you don't have a paycheck, if you don't have guaranteed recurring cash flow, then you're going to have a problem.
[02:34:23.451 --> 02:34:49.325]  That being said, I had a lot of success, sold some car washes, made some money, and Wayne Gretzky, who everyone knows, had a home for sale, a home that I watched him build, one of probably the most beautiful homes in the country, and so when I had an opportunity to buy this home, I wanted to buy this home at a certain price, because again, I put down the number, here's the number I have available, here's what I have to spend, bank comes back,
[02:34:49.805 --> 02:34:51.126]  It says we can do it.
[02:34:51.126 --> 02:34:52.906]  We can get you this loan for this amount.
[02:34:52.906 --> 02:34:54.287]  It's a bigger payment.
[02:34:54.287 --> 02:34:55.227]  Okay, all good.
[02:34:55.227 --> 02:34:57.028]  Show up at Esco.
[02:34:57.028 --> 02:34:58.229]  They have a song and dance.
[02:34:58.229 --> 02:35:02.450]  They tell me how they can refine me into another loan.
[02:35:02.450 --> 02:35:03.771]  They give me half the amount of money.
[02:35:03.771 --> 02:35:05.872]  They say, but we have the other half lined up over here.
[02:35:06.352 --> 02:35:06.813]  We're good to go.
[02:35:22.312 --> 02:35:25.854]  Not only do I now know there's such a thing, I lived through it, okay?
[02:35:25.854 --> 02:35:44.346]  These people tried to kill me, and when I say tried to kill me, JP Morgan literally got in bed with the trustee, and a trustee is somebody that handles a bankruptcy case, and that's another story, but got in bed with him and hired him as their lawyer in 300 new cases.
[02:35:44.346 --> 02:35:45.847]  Now, that trustee is
[02:35:46.724 --> 02:35:47.904]  He's no longer with us.
[02:35:47.904 --> 02:35:50.885]  I'm the first guy to make a trustee resign in 35 years.
[02:35:50.885 --> 02:35:51.686]  Okay?
[02:35:51.686 --> 02:35:54.407]  He didn't resign because he wanted a long vacation.
[02:35:54.407 --> 02:35:56.487]  He resigned because he broke the law.
[02:35:56.487 --> 02:35:57.108]  And I caught him.
[02:35:57.108 --> 02:35:58.108]  Okay?
[02:35:58.108 --> 02:35:58.608]  And J.P.
[02:35:58.608 --> 02:35:59.688]  Morgan's been caught too.
[02:35:59.688 --> 02:36:05.630]  Their own expert, their own expert, not only said my loan was predatory, it was unconscionable.
[02:36:05.630 --> 02:36:06.771]  Okay?
[02:36:06.771 --> 02:36:09.792]  So, when you have a DTI, a debt-to-income of 150%, okay, that doesn't work.
[02:36:13.533 --> 02:36:15.975]  The bottom line is they set you up to fail.
[02:36:15.975 --> 02:36:17.496]  It's equity stripping.
[02:36:17.496 --> 02:36:19.097]  It's predatory lending.
[02:36:19.097 --> 02:36:24.240]  Anything that you want to define it as, these banks are just pushing paper around.
[02:36:44.054 --> 02:36:47.297]  Well, there's no mirrors.
[02:36:47.297 --> 02:36:48.779]  Mirrors are done.
[02:36:48.779 --> 02:36:51.322]  That's a joke in and of itself.
[02:36:51.322 --> 02:36:57.709]  The issue now, and you're right on point there Alex, the issue now is standing.
[02:36:57.709 --> 02:37:02.374]  How do they come into court and prove they own your loan and they don't have the deed?
[02:37:02.834 --> 02:37:03.795]  That's exactly right.
[02:37:03.795 --> 02:37:06.678]  There has to be a trustee transfer.
[02:37:06.678 --> 02:37:09.320]  What they were doing was rubber stamping these things.
[02:37:09.320 --> 02:37:19.349]  Now when you go back and you do not only a forensic audit, but you now do an audit that's a securitization audit, that shows everything.
[02:37:19.349 --> 02:37:25.135]  And they cannot prove that that loan was illegally transferred or bought by the other bank.
[02:37:25.615 --> 02:37:36.085]  Oh yeah, they love to talk about when you were supposedly in trouble, but the fact that you're winning against JPMorgan in court, winning against the SEC, there's no news on that except for little footnotes.
[02:37:52.572 --> 02:37:59.958]  The SEC, probably the most powerful government organization in the world, told me they were going to put me in jail.
[02:37:59.958 --> 02:38:05.402]  They said, no way you're going to be 100-something picking these socks.
[02:38:05.402 --> 02:38:07.904]  And I said, you want to investigate me?
[02:38:07.904 --> 02:38:08.625]  Go at it.
[02:38:08.625 --> 02:38:09.265]  They did.
[02:38:09.265 --> 02:38:11.186]  Ten months later, I have a letter.
[02:38:13.388 --> 02:38:21.894]  And it's a letter that I keep in front of me every day and I look at it, and it says, Mr. Dykstra has done nothing wrong, okay, to sum it up.
[02:38:21.894 --> 02:38:25.337]  So, yes, they tried, they tried to take me down.
[02:38:25.337 --> 02:38:27.298]  This is all part of the banking system.
[02:38:27.298 --> 02:38:33.463]  This is all, they're all one group who tried to basically eliminate me off this planet, okay?
[02:38:33.463 --> 02:38:41.449]  And like I told them, I told them, I went into that courtroom and all the big, all these bankruptcy attorneys, because remember, let me, let me make something clear.
[02:38:42.310 --> 02:38:52.036]  I filed a Chapter 11, Alex, reorganization, which Donald Trump's filed one six times, many famous people have filed a Chapter 11.
[02:38:52.036 --> 02:39:03.384]  Two weeks into my 11, I was converted illegally to a 7 because Fireman's Fund, the insurance company, illegally canceled my insurance.
[02:39:03.384 --> 02:39:03.984]  Okay?
[02:39:03.984 --> 02:39:07.446]  When they canceled my insurance, they violated the automatic stay.
[02:39:07.446 --> 02:39:11.609]  The automatic stay means that they can't do nothing without permission from the court.
[02:39:11.969 --> 02:39:15.556]  So, out of nowhere, here I am with a hundred million dollars in assets.
[02:39:16.781 --> 02:39:20.743]  I've spun into a Chapter 7, which I don't even know what a Chapter 7 is.
[02:39:20.743 --> 02:39:21.603]  I'm in an 11.
[02:39:21.603 --> 02:39:25.845]  I have a way to... A Chapter 7 lets them take control of you and do whatever they want.
[02:39:25.845 --> 02:39:34.829]  And, and, and, and... Bingo was his name, because they did try to take control of me, and what they did is, so far, they've billed me a million dollars.
[02:39:34.829 --> 02:39:40.531]  I've paid them a million dollars in fees, and my estate has went backwards.
[02:39:40.531 --> 02:39:43.893]  They've tried to mow down and give away all my assets,
[02:39:44.273 --> 02:39:51.882]  Except the one asset that would have got me out of bankruptcy, my car washes, where the owners are in default on foreclosing on my car wash buyers.
[02:39:51.882 --> 02:39:55.586]  They haven't went after them yet because guess what happens?
[02:39:55.586 --> 02:39:58.329]  If they go after them, I'm out of bankruptcy.
[02:39:58.329 --> 02:39:58.830]  And guess what?
[02:39:58.830 --> 02:39:59.811]  They don't get their fees.
[02:40:00.351 --> 02:40:03.753]  So at the end of the day, the whole system's corrupt.
[02:40:03.753 --> 02:40:09.317]  I mean, look, when I go to war, if I go to war, at least I want to be on a fair battlefield.
[02:40:09.317 --> 02:40:11.619]  At least give me a gun, and you have a gun.
[02:40:11.619 --> 02:40:13.160]  Or a knife, and you have a gun.
[02:40:13.160 --> 02:40:15.742]  I had a flyswatter, but they had a shotgun.
[02:40:16.986 --> 02:40:17.346]  I don't know.
[02:40:33.504 --> 02:40:35.346]  I'm not laying down and dying.
[02:40:35.346 --> 02:40:36.187]  I'm fighting, okay?
[02:40:36.187 --> 02:40:37.649]  Because I'm right.
[02:40:37.649 --> 02:40:42.795]  And they're not going to take away everything that I've worked my whole life for because they think they can.
[02:40:42.795 --> 02:40:45.218]  They think I'm just going to be like the rest of them and die.
[02:40:45.218 --> 02:40:46.799]  So be careful.
[02:40:46.799 --> 02:40:48.642]  Be careful because if you're not,
[02:40:49.202 --> 02:40:51.183]  I'll keep fighting, and I'll find a way to win.
[02:40:51.183 --> 02:40:54.486]  And that's what I did, and I can help the American people win, too.
[02:40:54.486 --> 02:40:55.847]  I can keep families together.
[02:40:55.847 --> 02:40:57.748]  I can keep kids being...
[02:41:19.262 --> 02:41:25.188]  When not knowing the judge and the trustee and others are all playing inside baseball.
[02:41:25.188 --> 02:41:29.171]  You've been through the gauntlet so people can learn by your experience.
[02:41:29.171 --> 02:41:34.156]  As a frontline guy who went through this fire, came out even stronger on the other side.
[02:41:34.156 --> 02:41:37.219]  Give us some of the points that are covered at StopTheGreedyBanks.com
[02:41:38.539 --> 02:41:39.900]  Here are the points that are covered.
[02:41:39.900 --> 02:41:43.421]  I take a 1-2-3 basic SEP approach.
[02:41:43.421 --> 02:41:51.085]  I want everybody to know their life is not over when they get put in a position where they can't make a payment.
[02:41:51.085 --> 02:41:58.028]  The bottom line is these banks have a fiduciary duty to qualify you under TILA.
[02:41:58.028 --> 02:41:59.168]  It's a federal law.
[02:41:59.168 --> 02:42:00.109]  There's no arguing it.
[02:42:01.329 --> 02:42:02.771]  They can't argue it.
[02:42:02.771 --> 02:42:04.873]  They either did it right or they did it wrong.
[02:42:04.873 --> 02:42:07.836]  There's about a thousand different things that have to happen.
[02:42:07.836 --> 02:42:10.298]  And if they didn't do that, then guess what?
[02:42:10.298 --> 02:42:11.059]  You have rights.
[02:42:11.059 --> 02:42:17.906]  You have legal remedies where you can go in under TILA, under RESPA, and you can recover money, okay?
[02:42:17.906 --> 02:42:20.588]  And you can assert these offensive claims, okay?
[02:42:20.588 --> 02:42:24.032]  The bottom line is, nobody has known how to do this.
[02:42:24.492 --> 02:42:27.636]  We have families out there right now decimated.
[02:42:27.636 --> 02:42:34.384]  The American country, this country was built on the American family, is now being dismantled piece by piece.
[02:42:34.384 --> 02:42:35.365]  It cost me a 23 year marriage.
[02:42:35.365 --> 02:42:36.126]  I was married 23 years, okay?
[02:42:39.815 --> 02:42:43.697]  Because of JP Morgan, I'm not married now.
[02:42:43.697 --> 02:42:47.279]  I have a great wife and she's a great mother.
[02:42:47.279 --> 02:42:53.402]  And my son's not in the major leagues yet, but he's playing for Milwaukee.
[02:42:53.402 --> 02:42:54.802]  He was a second round draft pick.
[02:42:58.404 --> 02:43:01.825]  Yeah, well he will be, because he's a winning player.
[02:43:01.825 --> 02:43:07.188]  And at the end of the day, Alex, in my book, you're either a winning player or a losing player.
[02:43:07.188 --> 02:43:09.468]  Because the ones in the middle, you can throw out.
[02:43:09.468 --> 02:43:10.789]  Okay?
[02:43:10.789 --> 02:43:11.749]  I don't play that.
[02:43:11.749 --> 02:43:18.292]  But here's what I can do for all these people that are walking around waiting for the electric chair.
[02:43:18.292 --> 02:43:19.432]  Because that's what's happening.
[02:43:19.432 --> 02:43:20.713]  There's nowhere to go.
[02:43:20.713 --> 02:43:22.013]  There's nowhere to turn.
[02:43:22.013 --> 02:43:23.834]  They do not know what to do.
[02:43:23.834 --> 02:43:25.375]  And they're afraid to ask.
[02:43:25.375 --> 02:43:27.276]  They won't even answer their phones.
[02:43:27.276 --> 02:43:27.976]  If they call,
[02:43:28.826 --> 02:43:36.014]  If they call my number on my website, we have the lawyers, we have the experts that can help them and save their homes.
[02:43:36.014 --> 02:43:37.295]  It's not too late.
[02:43:37.295 --> 02:43:38.937]  It's not too late, trust me when I tell you.
[02:43:38.937 --> 02:43:45.104]  Well I'll say this, I've looked at your cases, I've looked at what you're doing, and it's right on from all the other top lawyers I know.
[02:43:45.464 --> 02:43:47.426]  Who are winning.
[02:43:47.426 --> 02:43:49.447]  I'm not getting lawyers on who haven't won.
[02:43:49.447 --> 02:43:52.770]  I've had a whole bunch of lawyers on who were in the U.S.
[02:43:52.770 --> 02:44:01.156]  City Today, Wall Street Journal winning, beating these major banks and you're one of the trailblazers who's been able to do this and beating
[02:44:02.077 --> 02:44:02.878]  The SEC.
[02:44:02.878 --> 02:44:04.959]  StopTheGreedyBanks.com.
[02:44:04.959 --> 02:44:13.466]  We'll put your website back up on screen so I can give folks the number 800-728-4981.
[02:44:13.466 --> 02:44:15.328]  800-728-4981 if folks want to find out more.
[02:44:15.328 --> 02:44:22.334]  But so much of what you did, just informationally, is there on the sites, your documents, what you went through, what happened.
[02:44:22.334 --> 02:44:23.575]  Now expanding on this,
[02:44:24.275 --> 02:44:27.818]  Two years ago, even 12 months ago, you talk about mortgage fraud.
[02:44:27.818 --> 02:44:37.665]  It didn't break until about six months ago that it was real, it was happening, it was premeditated, that they go into families and write them loans, that they want to fail.
[02:44:37.665 --> 02:44:38.785]  What's their endgame?
[02:44:38.785 --> 02:44:42.288]  Because if you've got millions, was it two, three million in foreclosure now?
[02:44:42.288 --> 02:44:43.769]  Millions that have been foreclosed on.
[02:44:43.769 --> 02:44:46.531]  A lot of people in California are just staying in their houses.
[02:44:46.531 --> 02:44:48.593]  Other neighborhoods are now ghost towns.
[02:44:48.593 --> 02:44:51.154]  It's happening in other areas of the country.
[02:44:51.154 --> 02:44:53.176]  What's the endgame here for the banks?
[02:44:53.846 --> 02:44:56.329]  Here's the endgame, and it's a great point.
[02:44:56.329 --> 02:45:00.654]  The endgame is... My attorney, by the way, I need to talk about him.
[02:45:00.654 --> 02:45:02.176]  His name is Moshe Mordner.
[02:45:02.176 --> 02:45:04.058]  Mordner Law, and the number is 646-820-8770.
[02:45:04.058 --> 02:45:06.460]  Moshe Mordner, with Mordner Law in New York.
[02:45:13.428 --> 02:45:20.250]  He's a brilliant attorney, and he's the one that put me in position to understand that my life isn't over.
[02:45:20.250 --> 02:45:26.731]  See, because what happens is, you have to understand, when you're going through foreclosure, you don't know what to do.
[02:45:26.731 --> 02:45:27.911]  There's nowhere to turn.
[02:45:27.911 --> 02:45:29.152]  There's no one that wants to hear it.
[02:45:29.152 --> 02:45:30.352]  There's no way to help.
[02:45:30.352 --> 02:45:31.392]  But guess what?
[02:45:31.392 --> 02:45:32.693]  There is a way now.
[02:45:32.693 --> 02:45:33.613]  And here's the endgame.
[02:45:33.613 --> 02:45:34.293]  The banks
[02:45:34.893 --> 02:45:39.837]  At the end of the day, they do not want to foreclose on these houses if they had an easier, softer way.
[02:45:39.837 --> 02:45:46.463]  So, what we're going to do, what we've done, is there's more than meets the eye.
[02:45:46.463 --> 02:45:52.789]  Once we've defeated these banks in court like we're doing, we're now going to go to the banks and say, okay, this loan is predatory.
[02:45:52.789 --> 02:45:57.833]  Okay, this million dollar loan, we're going to pay you $500,000 for it.
[02:45:57.833 --> 02:46:02.137]  When we pay you $500,000, the banks are going to say, great, that's no problem, guess why?
[02:46:02.817 --> 02:46:09.262]  The money that they lose between the 500 and the million, the majority of it, they get reimbursed anyway by the government.
[02:46:09.262 --> 02:46:11.283]  That's how crazy it is.
[02:46:11.283 --> 02:46:13.425]  Yeah, explain that, quantify that.
[02:46:13.425 --> 02:46:16.307]  They're already getting bailed out, so they're making money coming and going.
[02:46:16.741 --> 02:46:21.745]  Yeah, so at the end of the day, there won't be court cases.
[02:46:21.745 --> 02:46:34.095]  What there'll be is us buying these loans from the banks at severe discounted rates, and then we will have an underwriting division, an underwriting arm, that will qualify these homeowners the correct way.
[02:46:34.095 --> 02:46:35.036]  And by the way,
[02:46:35.496 --> 02:46:37.278]  We're not out to save the manatees, though.
[02:46:37.278 --> 02:46:42.402]  If somebody does not qualify for a loan, then they can't have that home.
[02:46:42.402 --> 02:46:44.243]  They will not be able to stay in that home.
[02:46:44.243 --> 02:46:52.870]  But the majority of them, if it's a million dollar loan, and we were able to cut it down to $500,000, 99.9% of these people will be able to save that home.
[02:46:52.870 --> 02:46:54.011]  And that's the big secret.
[02:46:54.011 --> 02:47:00.837]  The federal government isn't telling people that now in the last two years, the banks are negotiating if you know what you're doing.
[02:47:00.837 --> 02:47:03.699]  But if you don't know what you're doing, the people perish for lack of knowledge.
[02:47:03.699 --> 02:47:04.640]  They will eat your lunch.
[02:47:05.103 --> 02:47:08.026]  They'll eat your lunch, your life's over.
[02:47:08.026 --> 02:47:14.433]  Look, the American people, the American family's biggest investment is their home.
[02:47:14.433 --> 02:47:15.014]  Okay?
[02:47:15.014 --> 02:47:20.320]  When you take away, and you literally, and by the way, it doesn't go away.
[02:47:20.680 --> 02:47:22.080]  You're hoping that it goes away.
[02:47:22.080 --> 02:47:23.361]  You're wishing it away.
[02:47:23.361 --> 02:47:23.981]  But guess what?
[02:47:23.981 --> 02:47:29.562]  As the day gets closer and closer and closer, they come and they lock you out of your home.
[02:47:29.562 --> 02:47:30.622]  You have nowhere to go.
[02:47:30.622 --> 02:47:32.563]  You end up with divorce.
[02:47:32.563 --> 02:47:36.263]  You end up with kids and a girlfriend without a mother and a father.
[02:47:36.263 --> 02:47:38.284]  And it's a trickle-down effect.
[02:47:38.284 --> 02:47:42.145]  Well, Lenny, what I love about you is, for a while, you were pretty much homeless.
[02:47:42.145 --> 02:47:43.945]  You didn't go cry in your milk.
[02:47:43.945 --> 02:47:48.286]  You got fired up, got the facts, and went out with nothing and beat these people.
[02:47:49.090 --> 02:47:56.195]  You know, you're right, and it's not something that I'm proud of, but what I did is I did what I have to do, okay?
[02:47:56.195 --> 02:48:07.242]  One of the things I wasn't going to do is I wasn't going to just get on my knees, put my hands behind my head, and let them execute me, because that's what they do in them courtrooms.
[02:48:07.242 --> 02:48:11.265]  Well, that's what you were known for in the major baseball.
[02:48:11.265 --> 02:48:16.669]  You didn't start fights, but every time they slugged you or some guy attacked you, you beat the tar out of them.
[02:48:17.910 --> 02:48:18.330]  That's right.
[02:48:18.330 --> 02:48:18.870]  You know why?
[02:48:18.870 --> 02:48:22.454]  Because I used to tell my teammates, why are you talking to the other team?
[02:48:22.454 --> 02:48:24.636]  They're trying to take our money.
[02:48:24.636 --> 02:48:27.619]  That's the problem I have with sports now.
[02:48:27.619 --> 02:48:28.800]  Everyone's everyone's friend.
[02:48:28.800 --> 02:48:31.122]  Look, we're playing for real money.
[02:48:31.122 --> 02:48:32.643]  That's the business we're in.
[02:48:32.643 --> 02:48:34.425]  We play to win, okay?
[02:48:34.425 --> 02:48:40.691]  Now, if you think playing in the major leagues was hard, okay, and by the way, just remember some quick example.
[02:48:40.691 --> 02:48:42.513]  If you want to play shortstop for the Yankees,
[02:48:42.973 --> 02:48:46.380]  You have to take Eric Jeter's job, okay?
[02:48:46.380 --> 02:48:48.665]  So it's very, very difficult.
[02:48:48.665 --> 02:48:52.673]  The odds of making it to the major leagues are astronomical.
[02:48:52.673 --> 02:48:52.874]  But...
[02:48:53.740 --> 02:48:57.701]  That was a walk in the park compared to what I've been through the last two years, Alex.
[02:48:57.701 --> 02:48:58.541]  I don't want pity.
[02:48:58.541 --> 02:49:00.442]  I don't want anybody to feel sorry for me.
[02:49:00.442 --> 02:49:01.842]  Because you know what?
[02:49:01.842 --> 02:49:05.023]  Our country's about, what have you done for me lately?
[02:49:05.023 --> 02:49:05.383]  Okay?
[02:49:05.383 --> 02:49:07.684]  So I'm about going forward, not backwards.
[02:49:07.684 --> 02:49:12.265]  I look at what the situation, what happened, what caused the situation.
[02:49:12.265 --> 02:49:15.106]  I try to talk to my advisors.
[02:49:15.106 --> 02:49:16.247]  I remedy it.
[02:49:16.247 --> 02:49:17.767]  And I go forward and I fix it.
[02:49:18.127 --> 02:49:21.209]  I don't live in the past because it does nobody any good.
[02:49:21.209 --> 02:49:23.570]  I can't change what happened.
[02:49:23.570 --> 02:49:24.891]  I can change going forward.
[02:49:24.891 --> 02:49:25.752]  That's the bottom line.
[02:49:25.752 --> 02:49:26.752]  That's right.
[02:49:41.187 --> 02:49:42.128]  They go to that site.
[02:49:42.128 --> 02:49:45.151]  I still give three picks a week.
[02:49:45.151 --> 02:49:51.198]  I've shown, I've made my investors over $600,000, okay, that they've made.
[02:49:51.198 --> 02:49:58.585]  I have people, I have loyal subscribers that have stuck with me through the thick and thin, because guess what?
[02:49:58.585 --> 02:49:58.966]  Remember,
[02:49:59.586 --> 02:50:01.747]  I didn't get souped overnight, no!
[02:50:01.747 --> 02:50:03.608]  No, that's not what happened.
[02:50:03.608 --> 02:50:08.991]  I got put in a situation by a bank that they're criminals, okay?
[02:50:08.991 --> 02:50:11.632]  Well, Lenny, it's the oldest story in the book.
[02:50:11.632 --> 02:50:15.594]  They come, have you sign a contract 20 years before for the farm.
[02:50:15.594 --> 02:50:20.216]  You don't read the little clause about how they can demand all the note whenever they want.
[02:50:20.216 --> 02:50:24.718]  And a year before, you've paid 19 years, you're doing okay, your farm's making money.
[02:50:24.718 --> 02:50:25.959]  Every farmer knows this story.
[02:50:26.659 --> 02:50:27.060]  I don't think so.
[02:50:44.739 --> 02:50:48.380]  And they get you in the last year if you don't have the money right there.
[02:50:48.380 --> 02:50:51.041]  Our guest is Lenny Dykstra, also known as Nails.
[02:50:51.041 --> 02:50:52.502]  Website StopTheGreedyBanks.com.
[02:50:52.502 --> 02:50:57.704]  You can follow us on Twitter at Twitter.com forward slash TheRealAlexJones.
[02:50:57.704 --> 02:50:58.904]  We'll be right back.
[02:50:58.904 --> 02:51:00.325]  Stay with us at FullWars.com.
[02:51:01.483 --> 02:51:08.388]  Imagine being free of debt in just 12 weeks without payment plans or negotiating or hiring an attorney.
[02:51:08.388 --> 02:51:14.333]  18 years ago we cracked the code of debt collections and set tens of thousands of people free of their debts.
[02:51:14.333 --> 02:51:18.116]  It's called Zero Debt Guaranteed and it works for all debts.
[02:51:18.436 --> 02:51:20.237]  My wages were being garnished.
[02:51:20.237 --> 02:51:25.039]  So I used the program and the attorney dropped the case and he returned my money within two weeks.
[02:51:25.039 --> 02:51:28.881]  With Zero Debt guaranteed, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[02:51:28.881 --> 02:51:30.962]  There is no other program of its kind.
[02:51:30.962 --> 02:51:33.144]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[02:51:33.144 --> 02:51:35.665]  Call our help desk for lightning fast assistance.
[02:51:35.945 --> 02:51:36.305]  Let's do it!
[02:52:05.794 --> 02:52:10.335]  We believe will happen in the next 12 months that will shake the very foundations of our nation.
[02:52:10.335 --> 02:52:13.716]  We've told you about the video that details this shocking prediction.
[02:52:13.716 --> 02:52:17.377]  So far, over 6 million people have watched this free video online.
[02:52:17.377 --> 02:52:18.197]  Have you?
[02:52:18.197 --> 02:52:29.481]  Again, this big event has nothing to do with war or the stock market, yet it could change everything about your normal way of life, the way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your family.
[02:52:29.481 --> 02:52:30.681]  Could this really happen?
[02:52:30.681 --> 02:52:34.282]  Well, the man who created this video has been right about many predictions in his career.
[02:52:34.662 --> 02:52:40.926]  He was among the first to predict the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:52:40.926 --> 02:52:43.748]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:52:43.748 --> 02:52:47.191]  If you haven't taken time to watch this free video, do it right now.
[02:52:47.191 --> 02:52:49.452]  You may never think about America the same way again.
[02:52:49.452 --> 02:52:52.715]  You can find the free video at endofamerica3.com.
[02:52:52.715 --> 02:52:56.057]  Again, that's www.endofamerica3.com.

[02:54:11.468 --> 02:54:12.772]  I'm good.
[02:54:17.797 --> 02:54:18.758]  Look, here's the deal.
[02:54:18.758 --> 02:54:26.345]  The SEC was sent dossiers every year for 11 years by insiders of what Bernie Madoff was doing, and they protected him.
[02:54:26.345 --> 02:54:28.627]  You've heard Bob Chapman break it down here.
[02:54:28.627 --> 02:54:31.509]  The system is designed to shut down small operators.
[02:54:31.509 --> 02:54:33.171]  It's designed to nitpick.
[02:54:33.171 --> 02:54:36.513]  Remember what happened when Charlie Sheen was going to do the new loose change?
[02:54:36.513 --> 02:54:38.355]  And I knew about it a year before it came out in the news.
[02:54:38.355 --> 02:54:39.676]  I couldn't talk about it.
[02:54:39.676 --> 02:54:41.158]  Mark Cuban was called and threatened.
[02:54:41.980 --> 02:54:49.924]  I was in phone calls with these guys and told by the SEC on the phone, since you're going to make this film, we're going to put a magnifying glass down your throat.
[02:54:49.924 --> 02:54:55.067]  He made a couple hundred thousand dollars in stock trades and they claimed it was a fraud when the guy's worth $5 billion.
[02:54:55.067 --> 02:54:56.728]  Didn't even know what was going on.
[02:54:56.728 --> 02:54:57.468]  He beat them.
[02:54:57.468 --> 02:54:58.269]  They came back again.
[02:54:59.156 --> 02:55:00.337]  And it's the same thing.
[02:55:00.337 --> 02:55:11.644]  The SEC is a criminal organization run by the megabanks, the offshore criminals, to destroy this country and destroy the individual and to shut down small businesses.
[02:55:11.644 --> 02:55:16.327]  And Lenny, I can only commend you for your fighting spirit because I've read your cases.
[02:55:16.327 --> 02:55:18.748]  I've looked at the information at StopTheGreedyBanks.com.
[02:55:20.069 --> 02:55:21.570]  And what I'll tell you is this.
[02:55:21.570 --> 02:55:21.770]  Okay.
[02:55:47.745 --> 02:56:01.752]  Americans need to understand they have a legal, and there's a real remedy, okay, that they have to recoup or to lessen the claims that these banks are trying to do.
[02:56:01.752 --> 02:56:04.053]  And they're trying to steal your homes, and that's what they're doing.
[02:56:04.053 --> 02:56:05.394]  They're stealing homes.
[02:56:05.394 --> 02:56:09.356]  They're basically putting you in a loan where you set up to fail.
[02:56:09.356 --> 02:56:10.317]  They're pushing paper.
[02:56:10.317 --> 02:56:16.160]  I mean, look, the bottom line is the notes are owned by a bunch of pension funds that are now suing J.P.
[02:56:16.160 --> 02:56:16.500]  Morgan.
[02:56:16.800 --> 02:56:17.681]  I don't want to get into that.
[02:56:17.681 --> 02:56:18.682]  That's another story.
[02:56:18.682 --> 02:56:19.743]  Okay?
[02:56:19.743 --> 02:56:24.789]  These notes, they were securitized back by a bunch of different funds.
[02:56:24.789 --> 02:56:26.731]  It's not even real money.
[02:56:26.731 --> 02:56:30.015]  They're literally just pushing paper and transferring paper around.
[02:56:30.015 --> 02:56:31.316]  And then at the end of the day,
[02:56:31.977 --> 02:56:35.080]  What happens is the people suffer.
[02:56:35.080 --> 02:56:37.362]  The American families are the ones that suffer.
[02:56:37.362 --> 02:56:41.726]  I have a way where I can help these people and I can show them what I did.
[02:56:41.726 --> 02:56:44.468]  I lay it all out on my website.
[02:56:44.468 --> 02:56:45.509]  I hang it all out there.
[02:56:45.509 --> 02:56:46.550]  I show them.
[02:56:46.550 --> 02:56:48.251]  I show them the court document.
[02:56:48.251 --> 02:56:52.135]  I show them that they have real, real legal remedies.
[02:56:53.115 --> 02:57:00.318]  When they are getting foreclosed on, they have to understand that there is a code, the United States Code, okay?
[02:57:00.318 --> 02:57:11.062]  It's 1601, Title 15 of the United States Code, TILA, and defense is based on recoupment, fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, and negligent misrepresentation, okay?
[02:57:12.322 --> 02:57:14.123]  This is something that they have.
[02:57:14.123 --> 02:57:15.924]  There are grounds for remedies.
[02:57:15.924 --> 02:57:17.545]  Their life is not over.
[02:57:17.545 --> 02:57:18.885]  And that's the problem, Alex.
[02:57:18.885 --> 02:57:23.187]  People think they can't beat these big banks because they're bohemians.
[02:57:23.187 --> 02:57:24.068]  Look, J.P.
[02:57:24.068 --> 02:57:30.130]  Morgan has $650 billion in the bank in cash.
[02:57:30.130 --> 02:57:30.811]  Okay?
[02:57:30.811 --> 02:57:31.931]  In cash.
[02:57:31.931 --> 02:57:32.491]  Okay?
[02:57:32.491 --> 02:57:33.352]  That being said,
[02:57:34.093 --> 02:57:36.736]  Nobody thinks, they think there's no way out.
[02:57:36.736 --> 02:57:43.525]  And that's what I thought, until I met my attorney Moshe Mordner out of New York under Mordner Law, and he gave me real hope.
[02:57:43.525 --> 02:57:44.627]  He showed me a way out.
[02:57:44.627 --> 02:57:46.249]  We came in a back door.
[02:57:46.249 --> 02:57:49.433]  We came in through federal law, which is undisputed.
[02:57:49.433 --> 02:57:50.495]  You cannot argue it.
[02:57:50.555 --> 02:57:53.876]  By the way, the lawyers I've been interviewing say go federal as well.
[02:57:53.876 --> 02:57:56.536]  They say sue the big banks, get it into court.
[02:57:56.536 --> 02:58:00.597]  They'll immediately settle because they know that they've broken so many laws.
[02:58:00.597 --> 02:58:01.617]  It'll make your head spin.
[02:58:01.617 --> 02:58:04.197]  Folks can find out more at StopTheGreedyBanks.com.

[02:58:07.838 --> 02:58:09.418]  We're going to be using Twitter more and more.
[02:58:09.418 --> 02:58:10.479]  I'm going to follow my own advice.
[02:58:10.479 --> 02:58:13.439]  I gave Charlie Sheen two weeks ago to get a Twitter account.
[02:58:13.439 --> 02:58:16.480]  So again, Twitter.com forward slash RealAlexJones.
[02:58:16.480 --> 02:58:18.260]  I talk the talk, don't walk the walk.
