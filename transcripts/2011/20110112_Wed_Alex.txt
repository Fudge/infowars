[00:00:02.947 --> 00:00:07.152]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:07.793 --> 00:00:08.613]  You want answers?
[00:00:09.374 --> 00:00:10.295]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:10.916 --> 00:00:14.560]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:15.121 --> 00:00:19.225]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:29.532]  Well, we've learned a lot more about the tragic shooting that happened Saturday in Tucson, Arizona.
[00:00:30.352 --> 00:00:31.874]  Sarah Palin has responded.
[00:00:31.974 --> 00:00:35.717]  I have to say, I really wholeheartedly agree with the way she has responded.
[00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:50.610]  We're really getting a bird's eye view, a serious indicator now of exactly just how authoritarian the Democrats are and just how much tyranny they want to bring into this nation.
[00:00:52.173 --> 00:01:09.304]  Including massive free speech restrictions, massive Second Amendment restrictions, despite the fact we have Democratic House members saying things like, line up Republican governors and shoot them, and Obama saying bring a gun to Republican meetings.
[00:01:09.344 --> 00:01:18.891]  They bring a knife, we bring a gun, despite the fact we've got all this Democratic violence by unions against people across the nation.
[00:01:20.731 --> 00:01:24.334]  The media, MSNBC, CNN, and others hype it up.
[00:01:25.174 --> 00:01:29.978]  You know, when a Rand Paul supporter steps on some lady's head, they act like it's the end of the world.
[00:01:30.838 --> 00:01:38.864]  But when the Democrats are doing things many-fold more aggressive and a lot more frequent, they try to sweep it under the rug.
[00:01:38.904 --> 00:01:43.207]  But here's the issue that Chris Matthews and others are finally figuring out.
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.545]  I saw Matthews yesterday go, oh it's horrible what Michael Savage and others are doing.
[00:01:49.905 --> 00:01:53.489]  We checked to see if they have audiences and they have big audiences.
[00:01:54.109 --> 00:02:06.122]  As if Chris Matthews doesn't know that on his biggest night he might have a half million viewers and that somebody like Michael Savage has several million people tuning in to every 15 minute quarter hour.
[00:02:07.403 --> 00:02:11.146]  This radio show is approaching a million people every quarter hour.
[00:02:11.826 --> 00:02:20.873]  See, that's the big illusion, is that CNN is big, and that MSNBC is big, and that CNBC is big.
[00:02:21.153 --> 00:02:22.494]  They're not big.
[00:02:22.634 --> 00:02:23.935]  They're paper tigers.
[00:02:24.375 --> 00:02:25.196]  It's a joke.
[00:02:25.556 --> 00:02:26.577]  And they realize that.
[00:02:27.177 --> 00:02:34.283]  So they can get up there all day and blame Rush Limbaugh with 20-plus million listeners, conservatively every day.
[00:02:35.023 --> 00:02:40.985]  They can sit there and blame Alex Jones with over 2 million conservative listeners a day.
[00:02:41.886 --> 00:02:45.467]  They can try to blame the real media.
[00:02:46.047 --> 00:02:49.009]  That doesn't mean I agree with everything Rush Limbaugh or Michael Savage say.
[00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:50.629]  The point is, that's real media.
[00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:52.530]  It has real audiences.
[00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.651]  Glenn Beck has real audiences.
[00:02:56.311 --> 00:02:59.993]  Between radio, TV, the rest of it, he's reaching 20 million people a week.
[00:03:01.293 --> 00:03:02.454]  Nothing's as big as Limbaugh.
[00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:06.222]  Those are real audiences.
[00:03:06.622 --> 00:03:20.452]  So, of course, Chris Matthews, who literally has about the same members of listeners or viewers as a big city's local weather channel has at any one time.
[00:03:21.373 --> 00:03:22.313]  I mean, it's a joke.
[00:03:22.613 --> 00:03:28.938]  There are big talk shows in major cities that have more than a half million listeners every day.
[00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:32.479]  Chris Matthews is a joke.
[00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:33.800]  He is a ghost.
[00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.520]  He is a fraud.
[00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:36.820]  He is a hoax.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.521]  CNN is a fraud and a hoax.
[00:03:40.381 --> 00:03:52.644]  It's all a joke, except still people surfing through the channels, if they see you on Larry King Live, if they see you on Hardball, they think, ooh, you're on national television.
[00:03:53.404 --> 00:03:55.084]  Oh, it's so prestigious.
[00:03:55.704 --> 00:03:56.745]  They've got $10 million sets.
[00:03:58.405 --> 00:04:00.087]  And Alex Jones has got a $10,000 set.
[00:04:00.107 --> 00:04:01.028]  Really, a $3,000 TV screen behind me, $5,000 desk.
[00:04:01.048 --> 00:04:04.532]  I don't know, maybe the stuff in here, maybe $15,000.
[00:04:13.706 --> 00:04:22.673]  I'm sitting here, you know, I'm wearing a $400 sports jacket, and somebody like Chris Matthews would be wearing a $2,000, $3,000 one.
[00:04:22.913 --> 00:04:27.957]  See, it's all nothing but glaze, pixie dust.
[00:04:28.978 --> 00:04:30.899]  It's all a bunch of smoke and mirrors.
[00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:33.881]  Okay, I'm gonna reset here with all the info, come back.
[00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:35.771]  Get into what's happening.
[00:04:35.811 --> 00:04:37.071]  But of course these failures.
[00:04:37.712 --> 00:04:39.453]  No one buys their fake ideology.
[00:04:40.173 --> 00:04:42.294]  Of course these people can't get an audience.
[00:04:42.574 --> 00:04:47.237]  So of course they're out promoting the government shutting down my free speech.
[00:04:47.257 --> 00:04:48.898]  Glenn Beck's free speech.
[00:04:48.918 --> 00:04:50.759]  Rush Limbaugh's free speech.
[00:04:51.459 --> 00:04:52.700]  Sarah Palin's free speech.
[00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.703]  Because hardly anyone buys their baloney and their facades imploding.
[00:04:58.524 --> 00:05:01.827]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:05:02.107 --> 00:05:03.168]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:07.593]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:05:07.793 --> 00:05:13.438]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:05:13.738 --> 00:05:15.720]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.563]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[00:05:18.903 --> 00:05:25.206]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[00:05:25.407 --> 00:05:27.228]  They both make fabulous investments.
[00:05:27.628 --> 00:05:32.690]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[00:05:32.971 --> 00:05:37.953]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[00:05:38.253 --> 00:05:43.476]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[00:05:43.616 --> 00:05:46.558]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[00:05:46.798 --> 00:05:49.762]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[00:05:49.802 --> 00:05:50.563]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[00:05:57.822 --> 00:06:01.265]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[00:06:01.645 --> 00:06:05.709]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[00:06:05.929 --> 00:06:10.733]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[00:06:10.753 --> 00:06:15.817]  Not looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[00:06:16.577 --> 00:06:20.040]  Not worried about them moving south.
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.723]  Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[00:06:26.501 --> 00:06:33.743]  We're American and be proud.
[00:06:33.843 --> 00:06:36.204]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[00:06:52.193 --> 00:06:56.979]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.806]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:07:02.126 --> 00:07:06.192]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:07:06.452 --> 00:07:06.933]  Number two,
[00:07:07.313 --> 00:07:11.854]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:07:12.194 --> 00:07:12.654]  It's true.
[00:07:12.934 --> 00:07:17.495]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:07:17.815 --> 00:07:18.356]  Number three.
[00:07:18.636 --> 00:07:21.916]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:07:22.216 --> 00:07:25.917]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:07:26.137 --> 00:07:26.697]  Number four.
[00:07:26.938 --> 00:07:29.298]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:07:29.698 --> 00:07:33.039]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:07:33.359 --> 00:07:38.081]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:07:38.301 --> 00:07:43.063]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:07:43.343 --> 00:07:47.384]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:47.524 --> 00:07:49.085]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:49.305 --> 00:07:53.907]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:07:58.792 --> 00:08:00.974]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:01.535 --> 00:08:04.418]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:14.508 --> 00:08:21.174]  Rush Limbaugh has accurately said the last few days the talk radio is under siege.
[00:08:22.403 --> 00:08:25.824]  But if we don't all hang together, we will surely hang separate.
[00:08:26.725 --> 00:08:29.766]  It is not just talk radio that is under siege.
[00:08:30.406 --> 00:08:33.707]  It is free speech in this country.
[00:08:34.348 --> 00:08:38.029]  It's every man, woman, and child's right to speak their mind.
[00:08:38.349 --> 00:08:50.374]  We are being indoctrinated into a collectivist mindset that anytime someone commits a crime, it is collectively everyone else's fault, and that everyone else is punished.
[00:08:50.874 --> 00:08:56.878]  That is not just a hallmark of communism or socialism or fascism or other collectivist systems.
[00:08:57.438 --> 00:09:03.102]  It is a hallmark of very extreme tyranny.
[00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:26.697]  And so I wanted to play this clip of, first, a very short clip of Chris Matthews citing Mark Levin, Michael Savage, and others being complicit in causing the shooting, when we've now had almost five days to deeply research this, and we have a very clear image now of exactly what happened.
[00:09:27.577 --> 00:09:33.562]  And now we know why the police department and that anti-liberty Dupnick sheriff
[00:09:36.297 --> 00:09:38.539]  He certainly is a dupe to tyranny.
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:46.367]  Now we know why they don't want all this guy's writings and literature out there, because all the public writings of him now make it very clear.
[00:09:46.988 --> 00:09:48.189]  Rejected by women.
[00:09:50.331 --> 00:09:51.712]  Into voodoo.
[00:09:52.033 --> 00:09:53.314]  Now it's confirmed, voodoo.
[00:09:54.455 --> 00:09:56.557]  I see a skull and oranges around it, and candles.
[00:09:57.038 --> 00:09:59.000]  Doesn't take a rocket scientist, that's voodoo.
[00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:00.201]  Black magic variant of it.
[00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:08.151]  And now we've discovered from neighbors, friends, and others that he was, quote, almost every day.
[00:10:09.792 --> 00:10:12.153]  Almost every day.
[00:10:12.173 --> 00:10:15.374]  We're going to play a clip of this Associated Press interview coming up.
[00:10:16.374 --> 00:10:21.855]  Almost every day, taking a very serious hallucinogen.
[00:10:21.875 --> 00:10:26.937]  I mean, this is a type that's so high-powered, you literally see pink elephants and leprechauns.
[00:10:27.717 --> 00:10:30.398]  Salvia divinorium.
[00:10:31.303 --> 00:10:40.968]  Or divination, and it's a super high-powered Mayan or Aztec plant, a plant used by them, and he reportedly took this almost every day.
[00:10:41.428 --> 00:10:42.889]  Smoked it, ate it, you name it.
[00:10:43.329 --> 00:10:45.530]  I mean, obviously, he was completely out of his gourd.
[00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:54.795]  You can take one look at the guy, and hallucinogens, you know, for 99% of people are fine, if they're only taken every once in a while, from the studies I've researched.
[00:10:56.115 --> 00:11:04.181]  But people that already have mental problems and take a lot of it, or maybe take it one time and you go jump off a high-rise tower thinking you can fly.
[00:11:05.501 --> 00:11:10.104]  And you can better believe, ladies and gentlemen, that that's a big part of this.
[00:11:10.184 --> 00:11:17.209]  Now, Paul Watson has a big report out today that is so important to get out to everyone.
[00:11:19.398 --> 00:11:36.486]  And studying his criminology, studying his psychology, studying his M.O., his trappings, his music, the drowning pool, the things that he was into, was Loeffner in love with Congresswoman Giffords.
[00:11:39.168 --> 00:11:40.348]  We know he was obsessed.
[00:11:40.508 --> 00:11:41.649]  Letters back from her.
[00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:46.291]  You write a letter to a congressperson, you get a form letter back.
[00:11:46.631 --> 00:11:47.512]  He put them in a safe.
[00:11:48.632 --> 00:11:58.760]  He was called very liberal in 2007, 2008, 2009 by a score of different friends, family, locals, classmates.
[00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:00.781]  He was a supporter of her.
[00:12:00.821 --> 00:12:01.682]  We know that now.
[00:12:06.463 --> 00:12:07.924]  Obviously was attracted to her.
[00:12:07.944 --> 00:12:13.128]  We now know he had been rejected by women, as I said Sunday on radio, into the occult.
[00:12:13.468 --> 00:12:14.549]  Rejected by women.
[00:12:15.189 --> 00:12:19.312]  I called him as a nihilistic, wannabe devil worshipper.
[00:12:19.393 --> 00:12:20.413]  Rejected by women.
[00:12:20.673 --> 00:12:23.335]  So he tried to do the most nihilistic, shocking thing he could.
[00:12:23.676 --> 00:12:27.639]  Communism, Nazism, devil worship, hardcore drugs.
[00:12:27.979 --> 00:12:30.441]  Just an absolutely scrambled individual.
[00:12:32.009 --> 00:12:34.272]  And this is what the media doesn't want you to know.
[00:12:34.292 --> 00:12:36.515]  This is why they don't want you to know what's in that safe.
[00:12:36.916 --> 00:12:43.024]  This is why, because we're now learning in the Wall Street Journal's reporting, he was angry at women because they rejected him.
[00:12:43.224 --> 00:12:45.087]  Because he was an insecure creep.
[00:12:46.618 --> 00:12:48.540]  Women like one thing, they like confidence.
[00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:50.862]  Real confidence, not false confidence.
[00:12:51.322 --> 00:12:52.864]  And they certainly don't like creepy people.
[00:12:54.225 --> 00:12:57.768]  So, the question is, was Loeffner in love with Congresswoman Giffords?
[00:12:58.128 --> 00:13:12.922]  I can tell you, studying him, just like I told you he was a devil worshipper, Sunday night, long before it came out the next day in the news, there was no inkling of that other than the music he was into that's been associated with people killing themselves and family members, because he glorifies it.
[00:13:13.592 --> 00:13:14.933]  Let the bodies hit the ground!
[00:13:14.973 --> 00:13:16.174]  Let the bodies hit the ground!
[00:13:16.414 --> 00:13:20.317]  You know, stuff 14-year-old kids are into because they think it's powerful.
[00:13:20.778 --> 00:13:27.483]  If you're 22 and still into stuff like that and taking hardcore hallucinogens, quote, almost every day, you've got a problem.
[00:13:28.644 --> 00:13:33.708]  And I'm telling you now, he had a thing for the Congress lady.
[00:13:34.288 --> 00:13:35.229]  And she is good looking.
[00:13:36.579 --> 00:13:36.960]  Okay.
[00:13:38.142 --> 00:13:49.440]  And he had a thing for her as a liberal, back when he was a long-haired liberal who thought he might be a woman, and he was very confused, and the hallucinogens pushed him over the edge.
[00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:51.043]  They've not outlawed this drug yet.
[00:13:53.738 --> 00:13:55.739]  And I'm not even calling for it to be outlawed.
[00:13:56.259 --> 00:14:06.365]  Ladies and gentlemen, I can take you to anywhere in Texas out in the field, and if I've got enough acres to go over, I can find you scores of things that'll get you hired in a kite.
[00:14:07.045 --> 00:14:10.407]  Why did witches in Europe, quote, fly a broom?
[00:14:10.727 --> 00:14:21.113]  Well, they would run around with the broom between their legs in a sexual ritual, you can figure it out, hallucinating on silver nightshade.
[00:14:22.062 --> 00:14:24.186]  Which grows all over Europe and all over North America.
[00:14:24.768 --> 00:14:27.533]  Now if you eat too much of it, it'll cause your heart to explode.
[00:14:28.195 --> 00:14:31.541]  But, you take that, you're gonna, you're gonna go to the moon.
[00:14:31.922 --> 00:14:32.584]  Without a rocket.
[00:14:33.669 --> 00:14:35.249]  Are we going to ban Silver Nightshade?
[00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:43.511]  There are hundreds of plants, depending on your geographic area, that will send you to la-la land very, very quickly.
[00:14:43.931 --> 00:14:47.332]  So obviously now this has been super hot for years.
[00:14:47.732 --> 00:14:51.093]  He's been smoking it and gobbling it reportedly for years.
[00:14:51.613 --> 00:14:52.673]  And so there's your issue.
[00:14:52.993 --> 00:14:55.374]  A whacked out hallucinogen addict.
[00:14:56.889 --> 00:14:58.890]  Who already had underlying mental problems.
[00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:02.571]  And there may be some mind control in there, because he thought he was under mind control.
[00:15:02.891 --> 00:15:04.492]  And we certainly know those are real programs.
[00:15:05.552 --> 00:15:10.854]  And they'll pick somebody who's already unstable and create a psychological compulsion.
[00:15:11.554 --> 00:15:17.016]  But you got a guy who is a confirmed, quote, very liberal.
[00:15:17.036 --> 00:15:19.017]  We've got it from all these different angles.
[00:15:20.182 --> 00:15:26.104]  Just literally, it's got to be more than 30 plus people, I haven't even counted, who said, yeah, he was real liberal.
[00:15:26.124 --> 00:15:33.386]  He was involved in animal rights, he was a nice guy, he was for marijuana decriminalization, and then he starts taking hallucinogens.
[00:15:33.706 --> 00:15:36.007]  Then he starts listening to really whacked out music.
[00:15:36.767 --> 00:15:39.628]  And he just, his whole personality changed.
[00:15:40.068 --> 00:15:45.569]  He took on that aura of darkness that nerds tend to think is powerful.
[00:15:46.029 --> 00:15:47.150]  And I'm just, again,
[00:15:48.393 --> 00:15:53.163]  Giving you the MO of the average person that likes to imagine that they're a devil or a vampire.
[00:15:56.491 --> 00:16:00.413]  Anybody who studies culture knows that's one of the most popular cultures out there right now.
[00:16:00.793 --> 00:16:11.739]  And most people, you know, if your 15-year-old daughter likes to dress up like a vampire and have black fingernails and thinks it's cute and is into vampire books, most of the time it's not going to be a problem.
[00:16:12.139 --> 00:16:13.980]  But a lot of times they start cutting themselves.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.341]  They start committing suicide.
[00:16:15.681 --> 00:16:19.603]  It's very, very dangerous when people start going down this road.
[00:16:23.612 --> 00:16:27.293]  And I just want to tell all the nerds out there, if you want to find real power, find God.
[00:16:28.153 --> 00:16:29.074]  Find creativity.
[00:16:29.094 --> 00:16:34.195]  If you want to find real power, go down to a soup kitchen and help homeless people.
[00:16:35.475 --> 00:16:41.717]  And obviously he tried to find himself going out and helping at the local animal shelter, but that was two years ago.
[00:16:41.837 --> 00:16:44.878]  He got sucked into a whole devil culture.
[00:16:44.898 --> 00:16:51.060]  And whether you believe in the devil or not, his mind manifested that in this type of cold-blooded murder.
[00:16:53.919 --> 00:16:57.100]  He manifested that archetype that is in all of us.
[00:16:58.941 --> 00:17:03.363]  That's why what you are into and what you focus on, that's what idols were all about.
[00:17:03.583 --> 00:17:07.424]  You think the ancients just worshipped idols because they were a bunch of idiots?
[00:17:07.464 --> 00:17:15.007]  They worshipped idols as they were building that image in their mind's eye to then basically project their will.
[00:17:17.554 --> 00:17:18.614]  That's what all of this is.
[00:17:18.654 --> 00:17:19.975]  That's what a talisman is.
[00:17:20.055 --> 00:17:21.175]  That's what magic is.
[00:17:21.455 --> 00:17:23.096]  That's what focusing is.
[00:17:23.436 --> 00:17:25.457]  Your will is incredibly powerful.
[00:17:25.997 --> 00:17:26.937]  We are creators.
[00:17:27.018 --> 00:17:27.878]  We build things.
[00:17:28.158 --> 00:17:29.018]  We construct things.
[00:17:29.058 --> 00:17:34.100]  And we first construct things in our minds before we physically manifest them.
[00:17:35.221 --> 00:17:36.861]  That isn't magic.
[00:17:37.241 --> 00:17:41.423]  Magic is simply a way to compartmentalize that
[00:17:43.709 --> 00:17:48.732]  In the subconscious to the conscious, in the ancient mind before we understood science.
[00:17:49.433 --> 00:18:06.865]  Now we understand the human mind and more and what we're capable of and if Max Planck 110 years ago, the physicist, could envision atomic theory and on a chalkboard write out equations with uranium that could power giant reactors in cities or destroy them.
[00:18:08.493 --> 00:18:14.819]  Nikola Tesla could envision what is HAARP weather control today over 120 years ago.
[00:18:18.042 --> 00:18:23.047]  So this guy focused on death and destruction and he manifested it.
[00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:25.952]  A cocktail of women.
[00:18:25.972 --> 00:18:26.813]  What did I say Sunday?
[00:18:27.134 --> 00:18:29.898]  This will be women refusing him.
[00:18:30.679 --> 00:18:33.723]  Then he gets into darkness, looking for power.
[00:18:34.224 --> 00:18:37.849]  And what does the archetype of Satan offer?
[00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:39.131]  Black power.
[00:18:39.512 --> 00:18:39.852]  Dark.
[00:18:40.973 --> 00:18:42.233]  Mysterious power.
[00:18:43.034 --> 00:18:45.415]  The weak see evil as powerful.
[00:18:45.895 --> 00:18:47.895]  It's sold as sexy, as alluring.
[00:18:48.135 --> 00:18:49.576]  How many times have we discussed this?
[00:18:49.896 --> 00:18:54.518]  But it leads to burning cities and piles of dead bodies covered in maggots.
[00:18:55.518 --> 00:18:57.499]  Its fruits stink to high heaven.
[00:18:57.759 --> 00:19:01.520]  If you think that's beautiful, that's because you've been turned over to this.
[00:19:02.737 --> 00:19:17.784]  And if you've got any tingle in your spine left, any tingle on your skin, any goosebumps, when I talk about these issues, you still have a soul, you can still come back to the light.
[00:19:22.626 --> 00:19:26.127]  It's very hard to be fully given over to evil.
[00:19:27.028 --> 00:19:27.908]  Very few are.
[00:19:31.385 --> 00:19:37.169]  And so before you are in some hallucinogenic-fueled, deviltry rage, turn back.
[00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:40.732]  See, first the New World Order says there's no good and evil.
[00:19:41.052 --> 00:19:47.236]  Show that you're defenseless so you can't recognize it, so they can program you with the archetypes of death and destruction.
[00:19:48.257 --> 00:19:49.458]  Recognize good and evil.
[00:19:49.478 --> 00:19:50.659]  What have I been saying the last month?
[00:19:51.439 --> 00:19:54.501]  The key to defeating the globalists is learning to recognize good and evil.
[00:19:54.802 --> 00:19:56.503]  If you can do that, everything else follows.
[00:19:58.359 --> 00:20:02.229]  Your natural organic herbal formula for heart health is Heart and Body Extract.
[00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:06.060]  My name is Spann and I'm 68 years old and I live in Vermont.
[00:20:06.471 --> 00:20:10.934]  In the spring of 2003, I started to have problems with my heart.
[00:20:11.215 --> 00:20:13.116]  It felt like my heart was pounding.
[00:20:13.136 --> 00:20:14.597]  It made me feel breathless.
[00:20:15.018 --> 00:20:19.061]  I tried many, many different things to try to get some help for myself.
[00:20:19.461 --> 00:20:20.462]  Nothing did anything.
[00:20:20.542 --> 00:20:24.485]  Heart and Body Extract is very powerful, very effective, and works quickly.
[00:20:24.505 --> 00:20:27.967]  I saw one of Sharon's ads and ordered Heart and Body Extract.
[00:20:28.628 --> 00:20:31.290]  I noticed a difference quickly, within days.
[00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:36.352]  The episodes became less frequent and by a month had completely vanished.
[00:20:36.732 --> 00:20:39.314]  Usually you find a 30 day or 60 day guarantee.
[00:20:39.554 --> 00:20:44.156]  Heart and Body Extract comes with a lifetime 100% ironclad money back guarantee.
[00:20:44.336 --> 00:20:46.477]  Details at HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305.
[00:20:46.537 --> 00:20:46.757]  Call 866-295-5305.
[00:20:46.777 --> 00:20:47.657]  866-295-5305 for Heart and Body Extract.
[00:20:57.802 --> 00:21:00.124]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:21:00.144 --> 00:21:02.406]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:21:02.506 --> 00:21:05.688]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:21:05.728 --> 00:21:10.472]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:21:10.833 --> 00:21:15.016]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:21:15.336 --> 00:21:17.660]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:20.224]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:21:20.564 --> 00:21:23.148]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:21:23.488 --> 00:21:31.100]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:36.683]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:21:36.803 --> 00:21:39.084]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:21:39.124 --> 00:21:43.086]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:21:43.346 --> 00:21:44.246]  And I got news for you.
[00:21:44.406 --> 00:21:45.727]  You're everyone else.
[00:21:45.747 --> 00:21:46.807]  Invisible Empire.

[00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:58.661]  I'm Roger Rao at Midas Resources.
[00:21:58.921 --> 00:22:05.865]  If you are going through a financial rollercoaster because of your investment in stocks, bonds and other paper assets, perhaps you're ready for a change.
[00:22:06.006 --> 00:22:09.027]  You have an opportunity to change your financial security.
[00:22:09.207 --> 00:22:13.130]  Get the stability and peace of mind you deserve by investing in precious metals.
[00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:17.893]  Gold and silver have been a form of wealth protection for over 5,000 years all over the world.
[00:22:18.053 --> 00:22:24.218]  If you have seen your hard-earned money lose value because of inflation, sliding dollar, etc., it's time you stop the bleeding.
[00:22:24.278 --> 00:22:25.879]  The answer to your problems is simple.
[00:22:25.979 --> 00:22:32.924]  Gold and silver will protect your assets and your purchasing power, physical possession of precious metals, IRA rollover, etc.
[00:22:33.224 --> 00:22:34.725]  Call me, Roger Rao, at 1-800-325-7000.
[00:22:35.786 --> 00:22:38.487]  Call 1-800-686-2237 Extension 178.
[00:22:38.587 --> 00:22:43.269]  Take action today when we are still accepting paper dollars for gold and silver.
[00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:44.510]  Ready for a change?
[00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:46.811]  Call Roger Raw at 1-800-686-2237 Extension 178.
[00:22:47.211 --> 00:22:48.452]  Again, it's 1-800-686-2237 Extension 178.
[00:22:58.783 --> 00:22:59.923]  This is not a drill.
[00:23:00.003 --> 00:23:01.984]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[00:23:02.524 --> 00:23:04.105]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[00:23:04.425 --> 00:23:11.528]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[00:23:11.648 --> 00:23:15.990]  Now a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:26.274]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them, how to create the perfect hiding place, as well as the places you should never hide your guns.
[00:23:26.514 --> 00:23:28.095]  Under any circumstance.
[00:23:28.155 --> 00:23:35.060]  These and other closely guarded gun cashing secrets are guaranteed to keep your weapons safe and out of sight when the going gets tough.
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.040]  But listen up.
[00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:42.264]  For security reasons, the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time.
[00:23:42.325 --> 00:23:44.126]  Go to hideyourguns.com.
[00:23:44.166 --> 00:23:46.247]  That's hideyourguns.com.
[00:23:46.347 --> 00:23:46.827]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[00:23:46.847 --> 00:23:48.649]  Before they come for your guns.
[00:23:48.669 --> 00:23:49.109]  Hideyourguns.com.
[00:23:49.129 --> 00:23:49.389]  Right now.
[00:24:18.308 --> 00:24:22.032]  Was Loeffler in love with Congresswoman Giffords?
[00:24:22.452 --> 00:24:24.435]  We got Gerald Cilente coming up.
[00:24:25.235 --> 00:24:27.558]  Break down the economy, the shooting, the police state.
[00:24:28.018 --> 00:24:29.960]  When people lose everything, they lose it.
[00:24:31.061 --> 00:24:34.004]  When they lose their minds, they've obviously lost it.
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:37.864]  And will they be able to use this to erect a police state?
[00:24:37.904 --> 00:24:43.112]  They are certainly trying, and as society unravels, you're going to see more of this type of stuff happen.
[00:24:43.532 --> 00:24:50.863]  And we have to fully, not just defend ourselves, but get on the offensive and say, how dare you, blood libel!
[00:24:51.684 --> 00:24:54.807]  How dare you pin scarlet letters to people?
[00:24:55.047 --> 00:24:59.812]  How dare you say we need to shut up and give up our speech to you tyrants?
[00:25:00.833 --> 00:25:07.098]  Because somebody was whacked out of their mind on drugs and was obsessed with this woman and shot her and others.
[00:25:07.439 --> 00:25:08.480]  How dare you?
[00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:13.524]  The father and the mother of the little girl, the little green girl who was killed, have said that.
[00:25:13.945 --> 00:25:14.745]  And do they stop?
[00:25:14.946 --> 00:25:15.246]  No.
[00:25:15.526 --> 00:25:17.108]  They have no shame.
[00:25:18.479 --> 00:25:19.579]  Because they hate our liberties.
[00:25:19.619 --> 00:25:21.640]  What has Jay Rockefeller said in the last month?
[00:25:22.121 --> 00:25:24.461]  He said we would have been better off without ever having an internet.
[00:25:25.062 --> 00:25:28.183]  I want to shut down Fox and MSNBC.
[00:25:28.663 --> 00:25:35.246]  And if they can shut down their speech on those channels and imply that speech is bad, well you see where we're going.
[00:25:36.414 --> 00:25:41.177]  The Second Amendment and free speech, along with property rights, are the last pillars to go.
[00:25:41.818 --> 00:25:49.042]  And I'm looking at Illinois, where they've raised taxes by 66% in one swing on state income taxes.
[00:25:50.383 --> 00:25:56.667]  I mean, I'm seeing other states, some states are passing over a hundred taxes when you add all the fines and fees in.
[00:25:57.508 --> 00:26:00.010]  I mean, New York State's doing that.
[00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:02.591]  The city's, I mean, it's off the charts.
[00:26:03.332 --> 00:26:04.893]  And it's all going to offshore banks.
[00:26:07.028 --> 00:26:09.029]  Talk radio isn't just under attack.
[00:26:09.569 --> 00:26:11.250]  America is under attack.
[00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:23.515]  If we lose the free speech and the Second Amendment and the property rights, which you all see now under attack, the FCC announced they're taking over the Internet two weeks ago.
[00:26:24.016 --> 00:26:24.916]  They don't have jurisdiction.
[00:26:24.936 --> 00:26:25.816]  They're just declaring it.
[00:26:26.057 --> 00:26:28.238]  Kind of like Hitler declared, hey, Poland is mine.
[00:26:29.478 --> 00:26:33.400]  Or kind of like the Russians declared Czechoslovakia was theirs.
[00:26:35.236 --> 00:26:37.597]  Or kind of like the French declared Vietnam was theirs?
[00:26:37.938 --> 00:26:41.119]  It's just, hey, Internet's ours, we're going to start restricting.
[00:26:43.761 --> 00:26:48.303]  And then while they were gearing up all this legislation, they'd say, no, no, we don't want to take all your speech, just some of it.
[00:26:48.663 --> 00:26:50.645]  Oh, we don't want to take all your guns, just some of it.
[00:26:51.485 --> 00:26:52.386]  So here's Limbaugh.
[00:26:52.866 --> 00:26:54.427]  Well, first I'm going to get to the MSNBC.
[00:26:54.447 --> 00:26:57.428]  Here's MSNBC blaming it on Michael Savage.
[00:26:57.468 --> 00:26:58.149]  It's all his fault.
[00:26:59.248 --> 00:27:03.532]  Steven, I have to tell you, I'll mention a couple names without getting into too many fights.
[00:27:03.612 --> 00:27:09.618]  People like Mark Levin, Michael Savage for example, who every time you listen to them are furious.
[00:27:10.639 --> 00:27:12.201]  Furious at the left.
[00:27:12.761 --> 00:27:21.189]  With anger that just builds and builds in their voice and by the time they go to commercial they're just in some rage every night with ugly talk.
[00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:22.891]  Ugly sounding talk.
[00:27:23.311 --> 00:27:25.372]  And it never changes, it never modulates.
[00:27:25.392 --> 00:27:26.332]  They must have an audience.
[00:27:26.372 --> 00:27:27.413]  I looked at the numbers today.
[00:27:27.733 --> 00:27:28.954]  They have big audiences.
[00:27:29.394 --> 00:27:30.454]  And I guess that's the question.
[00:27:30.474 --> 00:27:31.034]  Aren't you jealous?
[00:27:31.054 --> 00:27:31.335]  Why?
[00:27:31.675 --> 00:27:33.596]  And is it ever going to stop if it keeps working?
[00:27:34.796 --> 00:27:37.417]  Is it ever going to stop if it keeps working?
[00:27:38.738 --> 00:27:39.498]  If it keeps working.
[00:27:39.738 --> 00:27:41.139]  He sounded pretty angry right there.
[00:27:41.519 --> 00:27:43.260]  He's calling it ugly talk, hateful.
[00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:50.733]  I mean, what about all these hypocritical statements by Democrats about lining Republican governors up and shooting them?
[00:27:51.394 --> 00:27:53.215]  All their statements about locking and loading?
[00:27:54.476 --> 00:27:58.058]  The West Virginia governor shooting bullets through the cap-and-trade bill?
[00:27:58.358 --> 00:28:00.760]  That's just political nomenclature!
[00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:04.682]  That's always been done, and I love what Sarah Palin had to say on this.
[00:28:04.722 --> 00:28:06.723]  We've got it up at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:28:07.284 --> 00:28:08.584]  When was it less heated?
[00:28:10.285 --> 00:28:12.487]  Back in those calm days when politicians
[00:28:14.434 --> 00:28:18.797]  And political figures literally settled their differences by dueling pistols?
[00:28:21.299 --> 00:28:21.799]  That's right.
[00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:25.982]  Look, the world has never been tame, and it's never going to be tame.
[00:28:26.802 --> 00:28:32.686]  And now we learn the police had been, not once, not twice, not three times, and they're keeping it sealed.
[00:28:33.207 --> 00:28:34.928]  That's in the New York Times today.
[00:28:35.868 --> 00:28:39.171]  But they had been over and over again to Loeffner's house.
[00:28:40.031 --> 00:28:42.353]  He'd been death-threatening people all over the place.
[00:28:44.633 --> 00:28:53.320]  Now I'm glad to see they're starting to arrest people that call up mayors' offices, citizens' offices, governors' offices and death-threaten them.
[00:28:54.882 --> 00:28:59.065]  I've had enough of people on record death-threatening me and using their name and doing it publicly.
[00:29:00.326 --> 00:29:11.176]  I had a guy 14 years ago on air saying where my sister went to school and saying go kill her when she was in high school and nothing was done.
[00:29:12.165 --> 00:29:12.945]  The police wouldn't do it.
[00:29:12.965 --> 00:29:13.906]  I had to videotape.
[00:29:13.926 --> 00:29:15.547]  The guy had an Axis TV show.
[00:29:15.887 --> 00:29:17.808]  I took it to the police and they laughed at me.
[00:29:18.608 --> 00:29:18.849]  See?
[00:29:19.089 --> 00:29:23.451]  They won't actually go after the real bonafide people.
[00:29:23.751 --> 00:29:26.492]  It's illegal to say, I'm gonna kill you.
[00:29:30.435 --> 00:29:31.775]  And to be serious about it.
[00:29:34.337 --> 00:29:38.459]  So, here is this sheriff and this police chief and others.
[00:29:39.761 --> 00:29:46.830]  Getting all this political hay out of this when they didn't do their stinking job when a crime had been committed.
[00:29:48.592 --> 00:29:49.493]  We're on the march.
[00:29:49.994 --> 00:29:51.596]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.517 --> 00:29:55.220]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.178 --> 00:30:13.632]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:30:14.653 --> 00:30:18.317]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:30:19.335 --> 00:30:31.346]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:30:32.087 --> 00:30:39.373]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:30:40.054 --> 00:30:49.644]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:30:50.424 --> 00:30:53.688]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:30:54.348 --> 00:30:57.452]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:02.082]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:31:02.322 --> 00:31:08.366]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:31:08.746 --> 00:31:15.830]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:20.673]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[00:31:20.993 --> 00:31:29.484]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[00:31:29.664 --> 00:31:33.389]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[00:31:33.911 --> 00:31:40.077]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:31:40.678 --> 00:31:44.101]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:31:44.581 --> 00:31:51.888]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[00:31:52.009 --> 00:31:52.469]  Thank you.
[00:31:57.914 --> 00:31:59.055]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:31:59.095 --> 00:32:05.758]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:32:06.018 --> 00:32:08.299]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:32:08.579 --> 00:32:13.761]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:32:13.962 --> 00:32:16.743]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:32:17.003 --> 00:32:19.064]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:32:19.304 --> 00:32:25.229]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:32:25.569 --> 00:32:28.752]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:32:28.932 --> 00:32:34.477]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:32:34.717 --> 00:32:36.038]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:32:36.358 --> 00:32:37.599]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:32:37.659 --> 00:32:40.221]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:32:40.341 --> 00:32:44.385]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:32:44.565 --> 00:32:46.586]  You can find the video at www.
[00:32:47.347 --> 00:32:49.048]  End of America 3.com.
[00:32:49.168 --> 00:32:50.148]  That's End of America.
[00:32:50.288 --> 00:32:51.629]  The number 3.com.
[00:32:51.749 --> 00:32:55.471]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:32:55.611 --> 00:32:57.352]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:33:00.193 --> 00:33:05.735]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:06.216 --> 00:33:08.757]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:18.627 --> 00:33:26.017]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to this clip of Rush Limbaugh yesterday saying talk radio is under siege.
[00:33:26.157 --> 00:33:28.440]  Well, if they can shoot down talk radio...
[00:33:29.502 --> 00:33:30.623]  They can bring down anything.
[00:33:30.663 --> 00:33:36.548]  I mean, this is frightening that they would brazenly be saying, you cannot criticize government.
[00:33:36.828 --> 00:33:44.074]  If you say something that puts a politician in a bad light, that may lead to someone attacking them.
[00:33:44.815 --> 00:33:46.837]  So you can't have aggressive speech.
[00:33:47.917 --> 00:33:51.020]  I can't say Obama is a criminal.
[00:33:51.841 --> 00:33:55.143]  He has a Chicago mob operation up there at the White House.
[00:33:55.544 --> 00:33:57.886]  He is involved in all sorts of criminality.
[00:33:59.864 --> 00:34:01.005]  According to them, I can't say that.
[00:34:01.045 --> 00:34:03.608]  In fact, we need to pull up the video from two years ago.
[00:34:04.809 --> 00:34:15.860]  It's in the Obama deception of News in Missouri, where the police and they had the district attorneys on TV saying, if you say he's not a Christian,
[00:34:17.659 --> 00:34:19.861]  We're going to have you arrested.
[00:34:20.342 --> 00:34:24.746]  If you run an ad that we think isn't truthful, we're going to arrest you.
[00:34:25.006 --> 00:34:29.671]  Normally, you'd have to have a civil action to go prove that something wasn't true.
[00:34:32.132 --> 00:34:34.394]  And there'd be no criminal charges.
[00:34:34.534 --> 00:34:35.675]  It's just made up.
[00:34:35.775 --> 00:34:45.384]  Remember when Obama's people, when they thought he was riding high and had that 80 plus percent approval rating right before he got elected and there would be no way to stop him and he would be our messianic leader?
[00:34:46.205 --> 00:34:51.870]  And they were openly in Missouri and other states saying, we'll arrest you if you talk bad about Obama.
[00:34:55.017 --> 00:35:02.966]  And the crazy thing is I see so many Democrats on websites vitriolically saying, yes, ban their speech, take their guns, and you almost think they're joking.
[00:35:03.226 --> 00:35:11.956]  And on YouTube, you click on their handles, and you go to their websites on YouTube, and it's communist flags, and communist marches, and Hugo Chavez.
[00:35:12.217 --> 00:35:15.861]  I mean, there are really a lot of people in this country who hate freedom.
[00:35:17.611 --> 00:35:22.672]  And again, when there were mild calls under Bush to restrict free speech, I attacked.
[00:35:23.132 --> 00:35:24.392]  I defended free speech.
[00:35:24.912 --> 00:35:26.513]  This isn't about liberal and conservative.
[00:35:26.713 --> 00:35:28.133]  It's about the First Amendment.
[00:35:28.353 --> 00:35:32.714]  I mean, their attack on the First Amendment is even more brazen than this attack on the Second.
[00:35:33.174 --> 00:35:37.055]  And it's the most brazen we've ever seen because the corrupt system is scared.
[00:35:37.135 --> 00:35:38.075]  They know you're awake.
[00:35:39.755 --> 00:35:43.776]  They know that liberty is swinging back on the pendulum.
[00:35:44.056 --> 00:35:44.996]  Let's go ahead and play Limbaugh.
[00:35:45.996 --> 00:35:57.963]  In continuing this template and narrative that the Tea Party, that Sarah Palin, that talk radio, that Fox News, is inspiring violence.
[00:36:01.585 --> 00:36:07.928]  They forget that in the process of so doing, they are attacking what is now a majority of Americans.
[00:36:08.589 --> 00:36:13.972]  They are accusing a majority of Americans of being accomplices to murder.
[00:36:16.412 --> 00:36:23.374]  Steven, I have to tell you... Okay, so that's the clip of him playing Limbaugh and then going back to attacking.
[00:36:25.514 --> 00:36:28.275]  But this is more than just talk radio being under siege.
[00:36:28.415 --> 00:36:42.658]  This is free speech under siege, and as if that's not bad enough, we've got a guy from neighbors, friends, classmates, people that hung out with him, who was on all sorts of drugs,
[00:36:45.265 --> 00:36:50.348]  Including, and this is the most important, Salvia Divinorium.
[00:36:53.389 --> 00:37:08.417]  Salvia Divinorium, known as Diviner's Sage, that's for shaman, is a psychoactive plant which can induce disassociative effects.
[00:37:08.857 --> 00:37:11.679]  That means you don't even know where you're at, or who you are.
[00:37:13.536 --> 00:37:19.239]  And is a potent producer of visions and other hallucinatory experiences.
[00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:25.963]  Its native habitat is within Cloud Forest in the isolated Sierra
[00:37:28.703 --> 00:37:34.346]  Mazateca of Oxacana, Mexico, growing in shady and moist locations.
[00:37:34.666 --> 00:37:45.291]  The plant grows to over a meter high, has hollow square stems, large leaves, and occasional white flowers with violet calyx.
[00:37:47.714 --> 00:37:52.356]  And it goes into how it is one of the most hardcore hallucinogens out there.
[00:37:52.616 --> 00:38:04.760]  I mean, you want to see the Lucky Charms, Four Leaf Clover, Leprechaun, you want to see Pink Elephants, you want to see Easter Bunnies, this is the way to do it.
[00:38:06.235 --> 00:38:19.081]  And now we know from the Wall Street Journal, from his writings on online video game forums that are confirmed to be Jared Lee Loeffner, that he was angry at women, he couldn't get women, and that he was outraged.
[00:38:19.101 --> 00:38:21.342]  Now we know he was obsessed with this Congresswoman.
[00:38:21.842 --> 00:38:26.504]  We know that he was a liberal, quote, very liberal from all his friends in 2007-2008.
[00:38:26.864 --> 00:38:32.667]  We know that he went to her events, he took letters from her and put them in the safety deposit box, locked them up in his safe at his house.
[00:38:33.527 --> 00:38:38.271]  He was obsessed with her, and that's why we have the article today at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:38:39.012 --> 00:38:41.474]  Was Loeffner in love with Congresswoman Giffords?
[00:38:41.534 --> 00:38:44.857]  And the answer was, he was bare minimum obsessed fan.
[00:38:45.437 --> 00:38:54.124]  And as I predicted, end of the occult Sunday, rejected by women, trying to be shocking, starts taking hardcore hallucinogens, quote, almost every day.
[00:38:54.445 --> 00:38:55.886]  Neighbors that knew him and hung out with him.
[00:38:57.443 --> 00:38:59.624]  He flew over the cuckoo's nest.
[00:38:59.905 --> 00:39:05.208]  Joining us is Eric Mancow Muller, a nationwide syndicated radio host on Talk Radio Networks.
[00:39:05.228 --> 00:39:07.950]  He's on stations like WABC in New York.
[00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:12.073]  Good to have him with us for the next 10 minutes to break this down.
[00:39:12.113 --> 00:39:15.475]  He was one of the only guys, I was on his show Sunday, he got it.
[00:39:15.595 --> 00:39:21.379]  No one else got it, but Mancow and myself, I have to say, we called it as loner, devil worshiper,
[00:39:22.279 --> 00:39:28.507]  On drugs, who couldn't get women, obsessed with the Congresswoman, and now that picture is becoming crystal clear.
[00:39:29.148 --> 00:39:35.395]  Mancow, how does this get blamed on Sarah Palin, the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, Rush Limbaugh, and Alex Jones?
[00:39:35.415 --> 00:39:36.396]  They're also blaming it on me.
[00:39:38.131 --> 00:39:43.335]  I have a very good friend of mine, Mark Lovin, and a guy that works for my company, which is Michael Savage.
[00:39:43.936 --> 00:39:45.016]  They're blaming everybody.
[00:39:45.477 --> 00:39:48.979]  And the fact is that since the beginning of time, maybe even Eve.
[00:39:49.079 --> 00:39:49.840]  Don't eat the apple.
[00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:50.561]  Don't eat the apple.
[00:39:50.581 --> 00:39:52.362]  You can have everything, just not the apple.
[00:39:53.003 --> 00:39:54.924]  You know, people do the wrong thing sometimes.
[00:39:55.204 --> 00:39:57.926]  And this guy was unstable.
[00:39:57.946 --> 00:39:58.907]  He was a kook.
[00:39:59.848 --> 00:40:01.369]  Look, I have been to many parties.
[00:40:01.709 --> 00:40:03.891]  You know, I go to all the hip parties, Alex.
[00:40:03.991 --> 00:40:06.133]  And I went on a canoe trip.
[00:40:07.319 --> 00:40:12.802]  And Salvio was the rage about a year ago, and all the hip people were doing it.
[00:40:12.822 --> 00:40:13.983]  You could get it off the internet.
[00:40:14.703 --> 00:40:18.705]  It's a book by Pinchot, it's the writer's name, called Breaking Open the Head.
[00:40:18.765 --> 00:40:19.746]  It's one of the greatest books.
[00:40:19.806 --> 00:40:20.446]  I love the book.
[00:40:20.686 --> 00:40:25.549]  And it's got a castanetta, was that the guy Castaneda that wrote all this stuff in the 60s?
[00:40:25.969 --> 00:40:30.712]  Anyway, he talks about shamanism, and a lot of people at his age
[00:40:31.352 --> 00:40:31.812]  We're good to go.
[00:40:52.756 --> 00:40:56.177]  A group of women, the Kardashians and Lindsay Lohan, these people that are celebrated.
[00:40:56.717 --> 00:41:04.539]  But in that late, you know, 18, 19 and into the 20s, into that crowd, Salty is hot.
[00:41:05.159 --> 00:41:07.039]  And in many states you can get it legal.
[00:41:07.679 --> 00:41:08.760]  And I've been around people that do it.
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:19.702]  You take a couple of pops and instantly, you know, you talk about pink elephants and all this, but you're certainly seeing the trees come alive and the walls talk to you, depending on the strain that you get.
[00:41:20.521 --> 00:41:22.502]  And this guy was doing this on a daily basis.
[00:41:24.303 --> 00:41:34.928]  And so this link to Palin and, you know, look back and back in his fake crying is a little creepy to me.
[00:41:35.288 --> 00:41:41.571]  I've teased Glenn about that, but to blame any of these people or Rush, the sheriff came out and blamed Rush yesterday.
[00:41:42.071 --> 00:41:47.874]  I don't understand why the sheriff, Alex, in Arizona, first of all, why didn't they have one of their policemen there?
[00:41:49.016 --> 00:41:53.200]  So he's partially to blame, but then to blame, you know, everybody but the man.
[00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:54.921]  And I can go on and on.
[00:41:54.941 --> 00:41:56.022]  Hold on, hold on.
[00:41:56.242 --> 00:41:57.704]  Let me expand on that.
[00:41:58.044 --> 00:42:04.830]  Mankind, let me expand on that, because the New York Times is now reporting that they didn't go once, they didn't go twice, they didn't go three times.
[00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:08.773]  They're admitting they've been to his house over and over again, but that's staying sealed.
[00:42:09.073 --> 00:42:10.675]  They're covering their rear end right now.
[00:42:11.495 --> 00:42:14.418]  It turns out he'd made death threats to all sorts of people.
[00:42:14.718 --> 00:42:19.502]  He'd been kicked out of college in September, just four months ago, for threatening people.
[00:42:19.903 --> 00:42:24.647]  All he talked about was mind control, in person, saying he was under mind control.
[00:42:24.687 --> 00:42:25.868]  We don't know if that's true.
[00:42:26.568 --> 00:42:33.294]  Uh, or not, but they do scramble people that are under my control from the declassified documents so badly that they don't even know really who they are anymore.
[00:42:33.694 --> 00:42:39.238]  And now, the Associated Press reports, officers stopped suspect on day of Arizona shooting.
[00:42:39.619 --> 00:42:46.444]  A wildlife officer pulled over the suspect in the assassination attempt against Arizona Congresswoman less than three hours before the deadly attack, authorities said Wednesday.
[00:42:46.845 --> 00:42:51.668]  As they pieced together more details of the frenzied morning, Jared Loeffner,
[00:42:52.389 --> 00:42:52.649]  I don't
[00:43:13.046 --> 00:43:15.167]  Well, Alex, it reminds me of the Times Square bomber.
[00:43:15.187 --> 00:43:17.968]  I took my children, you know, I'm in New York for WABC.
[00:43:17.988 --> 00:43:19.428]  I took my children to see The Lion King.
[00:43:38.889 --> 00:43:41.050]  And this terrorist wanted to blow up the Lion King.
[00:43:41.090 --> 00:43:50.714]  He wanted to have, you know, he had all these bombs packed with ball bearings so that they would explode and go through everybody that was leaving this family musical, Disney's Lion King.
[00:43:50.754 --> 00:43:54.556]  And the first thing that Bloomberg said and the rest was, well, it's probably a Tea Party person.
[00:43:55.776 --> 00:44:03.980]  And the sad reality, and of course, you and I using this very dangerous thing that we mustn't use in America right now called common sense.
[00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:06.241]  The really
[00:44:08.331 --> 00:44:09.832]  You know, I hate to admit it.
[00:44:10.473 --> 00:44:13.194]  I really hate to admit it, because I wish this wasn't true what I'm about to say.
[00:44:13.795 --> 00:44:18.438]  But you don't really see many people at these Tea Party events that are under 50.
[00:44:19.319 --> 00:44:21.380]  I wish they would sex it up.
[00:44:22.101 --> 00:44:24.022]  I wish the young people were more into the Tea Party.
[00:44:24.942 --> 00:44:26.464]  And we're talking about radio.
[00:44:26.644 --> 00:44:31.787]  So, you know, a guy that's 22 years old, Rush, God love him, is turning 60 years old today.
[00:44:31.807 --> 00:44:35.710]  A 22-year-old pot-smoking atheist isn't listening to Rush.
[00:44:36.613 --> 00:44:37.874]  And isn't part of the Tea Party.
[00:44:37.934 --> 00:44:40.235]  Tea Party folks are, you know, got guns and guts.
[00:44:41.155 --> 00:44:45.217]  So, you and I knew immediately, because, again, we're not stupid asses.
[00:44:45.657 --> 00:44:46.398]  We're not stupid.
[00:44:47.138 --> 00:44:50.039]  We knew immediately that this guy was not going to be a Tea Partier.
[00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:53.021]  You just have to look at the makeup of the Tea Party crowd.
[00:44:53.781 --> 00:44:57.623]  So, it's all nonsense, but, you know, look, Alex, feel good about this.
[00:44:57.643 --> 00:44:58.804]  You and I get to talk about it.
[00:45:00.624 --> 00:45:05.647]  Once again, America gets to see how this lamestream media is nothing but
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:08.319]  The propaganda wing of government!
[00:45:08.902 --> 00:45:10.062]  Well, that's my next point.
[00:45:10.082 --> 00:45:10.923]  You're absolutely right.
[00:45:11.243 --> 00:45:23.108]  They have national polls out, and it shows that the vast majority of Americans, in fact, here's the headline, poll, Americans reject media hoax on Arizona shootings.
[00:45:23.668 --> 00:45:31.831]  Over 70% now do not want more gun control and reject this as a political stunt.
[00:45:31.851 --> 00:45:34.172]  I've got a whole bunch of different polls showing this.
[00:45:34.212 --> 00:45:36.233]  So this has really blown up
[00:45:37.415 --> 00:45:38.195]  in their face
[00:45:57.583 --> 00:45:59.825]  The mouse that tried to roar and couldn't.
[00:45:59.845 --> 00:46:01.106]  They're paper tigers.
[00:46:01.526 --> 00:46:14.457]  But they do have people in Congress, like Jay Rockefeller, that says, end the internet, have the FCC, take over free speech, don't let people say things that could, quote, stir folks up, bring the fairness doctrine back in.
[00:46:14.757 --> 00:46:16.739]  I mean, they are really showing their hand right now.
[00:46:17.381 --> 00:46:20.423]  Well, I mean, I love this, you know.
[00:46:23.665 --> 00:46:27.567]  I love now they're saying, well, okay, okay, so he's not a right winger, but maybe next time.
[00:46:29.389 --> 00:46:31.730]  And I believe they're creating this.
[00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:35.412]  I hate to say this, but let me ask you something, Alex.
[00:46:35.452 --> 00:46:43.938]  Do you remember the whole time during George W. Bush, the media night and day went on and on about how they couldn't show body bags coming back from Afghanistan?
[00:46:45.059 --> 00:46:45.259]  Yes.
[00:46:47.978 --> 00:46:49.399]  Yes, I'm there, I remember it.
[00:46:49.419 --> 00:46:58.304]  Okay, you remember the media, George W. Bush, and, you know, I'm no fan of his either, but, you know, Afghanistan, why can't we show body bags?
[00:46:59.425 --> 00:47:01.346]  Iraq, why can't we show body bags?
[00:47:01.686 --> 00:47:06.369]  And then Obama comes in and goes, okay, can't show body bags, and they don't.
[00:47:06.610 --> 00:47:10.012]  It reminds me, and I'm old enough to admit I remember this.
[00:47:13.539 --> 00:47:16.041]  He's on TV with Ronald Reagan every night.
[00:47:16.081 --> 00:47:16.681]  Homeless people.
[00:47:16.701 --> 00:47:17.902]  He doesn't care about the homeless people.
[00:47:18.382 --> 00:47:19.923]  He doesn't care about people with AIDS.
[00:47:20.724 --> 00:47:26.468]  Every single... And the minute they got the media, the minute they got the guy and they want it, you don't see these things anymore.
[00:47:26.488 --> 00:47:27.468]  It's all propaganda.
[00:47:27.488 --> 00:47:28.569]  They're planning this stuff.
[00:47:29.169 --> 00:47:29.990]  I hate to say it.
[00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:32.572]  I really hate... I hate to think it.
[00:47:32.852 --> 00:47:34.673]  But look, I know a lot of these people.
[00:47:35.453 --> 00:47:36.234]  This is good news.
[00:47:36.494 --> 00:47:37.515]  This is ratings for them.
[00:47:38.582 --> 00:47:43.385]  I love the guy last night on Ed Schultz, the hero that tackled the shooter.
[00:47:43.405 --> 00:47:47.287]  He had a gun on him and he said, look, I'm glad I didn't get to kill him.
[00:47:47.607 --> 00:47:52.570]  I'm glad he, but I wish he had, uh, I really wish Lofter had been shot.
[00:47:53.451 --> 00:47:57.733]  But, uh, no, I mean, this guy made the point and Ed Schultz didn't like it because he's
[00:47:59.065 --> 00:48:13.279]  Well they also hate the fact that the father has said don't use my nine-year-old daughter's death to to take more liberties and he took a shot at the TSA saying look at what's happened with airport security and how horrible it is since then.
[00:48:13.559 --> 00:48:17.223]  This is clearly not going the way they want but they have the old memory of
[00:48:17.483 --> 00:48:21.286]  of 10, 15, 20 years ago when they were the only dominant media.
[00:48:21.726 --> 00:48:25.209]  Now they don't realize that no one is listening to them.
[00:48:25.549 --> 00:48:30.853]  No one is buying in to their brainwashing, to their programming anymore.
[00:48:30.893 --> 00:48:32.595]  So what do you expect them to do next?
[00:48:33.395 --> 00:48:34.556]  Well, Alex, listen.
[00:48:34.716 --> 00:48:35.757]  Let me tell you something, brother.
[00:48:36.017 --> 00:48:37.298]  Here's the deal, okay?
[00:48:38.379 --> 00:48:40.160]  These are good times.
[00:48:41.241 --> 00:48:42.602]  These are good times, folks.
[00:48:43.263 --> 00:48:44.243]  We're on the right path.
[00:48:44.484 --> 00:48:46.085]  Some people feel that this was a setup.
[00:48:47.688 --> 00:48:48.508]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:48:48.628 --> 00:48:50.209]  Look, it doesn't matter what it was.
[00:48:50.389 --> 00:48:51.749]  The fact is we're on the right path.
[00:48:52.230 --> 00:48:53.510]  We have checks and balances.
[00:48:54.250 --> 00:48:55.531]  We have Republicans in there.
[00:48:55.611 --> 00:48:57.611]  I'm not a big fan of the way they spend either.
[00:48:57.691 --> 00:48:58.611]  I want to keep my money.
[00:48:58.751 --> 00:49:03.213]  There's nothing noble about you giving up your money that you work so hard for so others can sit around.
[00:49:04.413 --> 00:49:07.794]  But look, this Congress started with the reading of the Constitution.
[00:49:08.434 --> 00:49:13.476]  The Republicans and the Democrats, and I know a lot of it's like WWE, it's a lot of fake fighting.
[00:49:14.358 --> 00:49:17.240]  But let them fight, and hopefully we'll get back some of our freedoms.
[00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:18.600]  I do think we're on the right path.
[00:49:18.660 --> 00:49:23.723]  I think that both parties realize that Americans are sick of doing all the work.
[00:49:23.763 --> 00:49:25.364]  It's like that 1927 Fritz Lang masterpiece.
[00:49:32.373 --> 00:49:35.114]  I think they're really starting to get that we're fed up.
[00:49:35.674 --> 00:49:38.515]  I think the Tea Party movement was an abomination to them.
[00:49:38.535 --> 00:49:40.996]  They didn't expect it.
[00:49:41.436 --> 00:49:42.737]  So I think we're on the right path.
[00:49:42.817 --> 00:49:44.157]  I think this is a bump in the road.
[00:49:44.757 --> 00:49:45.817]  I think this guy is a freak.
[00:49:46.038 --> 00:49:48.358]  You know, Alex, you and I, I'll tell you, we were the only ones.
[00:49:48.598 --> 00:49:49.519]  We were so ahead on this.
[00:49:49.599 --> 00:49:52.520]  John Lennon's killer loved him, loved John Lennon.
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:57.941]  Selena's killer was head of her fan club and so on and so on.
[00:49:57.981 --> 00:49:59.802]  You and I suspected that this guy
[00:50:01.152 --> 00:50:02.913]  Was gonna be somebody that loved her.
[00:50:02.953 --> 00:50:06.154]  Not a Palin fan, but the exact opposite.
[00:50:06.234 --> 00:50:07.635]  Somebody that was in love with Gabby.
[00:50:07.655 --> 00:50:10.576]  She's an attractive woman, great American success story.
[00:50:10.796 --> 00:50:18.699]  Hey, it's also great to note that when these people are talking about more gun laws and grabbing our guns, they're going against Gabby.
[00:50:19.219 --> 00:50:25.502]  Because Gabby, the woman sitting there recovering with a bullet that went through her head, Gabby is pro-gun.
[00:50:27.003 --> 00:50:27.983]  She's pro-gun, you know?
[00:50:29.731 --> 00:50:33.953]  Absolutely, and pro-national security on the border.
[00:50:33.973 --> 00:50:36.154]  Mancow, I know you are busy and got to go.
[00:50:36.174 --> 00:50:42.676]  Let's do one more quick segment on the other side and continue to flesh this out and break it down.
[00:50:43.116 --> 00:50:46.097]  Plus, I want to talk about Illinois, a state you spent a lot of time in.
[00:50:46.417 --> 00:50:50.159]  A 66% increase in income tax there.
[00:50:50.559 --> 00:50:54.060]  I mean, my goodness, in the past they would just up it a few points every year.
[00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:56.161]  Now 66% in one year?
[00:50:56.501 --> 00:50:58.062]  I mean, unbelievable.
[00:50:58.991 --> 00:51:03.452]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:51:44.722 --> 00:51:44.922]  That's 1-877-886-3653.
[00:51:52.785 --> 00:52:00.652]  They helped create a New World Order.
[00:52:00.732 --> 00:52:02.914]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:52:02.934 --> 00:52:05.876]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:06.277 --> 00:52:11.021]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:11.381 --> 00:52:15.585]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:15.885 --> 00:52:18.207]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:18.227 --> 00:52:20.750]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:20.770 --> 00:52:23.692]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:24.033 --> 00:52:31.620]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:37.245]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:37.345 --> 00:52:40.127]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:40.207 --> 00:52:43.650]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:43.890 --> 00:52:44.791]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:44.971 --> 00:52:46.272]  You're everyone else.
[00:52:46.292 --> 00:52:47.353]  Invisible Empire.

[00:53:52.776 --> 00:53:54.997]  The next generation of alternative smoking.
[00:54:00.638 --> 00:54:03.822]  Okay, Eric Mancow-Muller will be joining us five minutes to the next hour.
[00:54:03.842 --> 00:54:13.633]  Then we've got Gerald Solente on the shooting, the police state, the incredible economic developments as more and more countries go down to the central banks.
[00:54:13.713 --> 00:54:14.655]  It's called a bailout.
[00:54:14.975 --> 00:54:18.859]  When you actually read the internal documents, those countries are being taken down by design.
[00:54:20.663 --> 00:54:25.805]  So a lot of things are happening while we're busy focused on this shooting situation.
[00:54:26.625 --> 00:54:40.209]  But to see the quote of Brad Sherman that Mancow mentioned earlier, we played the clip yesterday, he actually said on Fox News that, well, even if this wasn't politically motivated, because now they're having to start admitting that.
[00:54:40.469 --> 00:54:46.751]  The sheriff isn't stopping and Bill Clinton and Hillary aren't stopping, but those that are smarter back it off.
[00:54:47.511 --> 00:54:49.072]  Sherman, who we've had on the show, says, well,
[00:54:51.047 --> 00:54:53.669]  Even if this wasn't politically motivated, the next one will be.
[00:54:53.729 --> 00:54:57.871]  And that's the other big issue here, Mancow, is that I understand how media works.
[00:54:57.891 --> 00:54:58.992]  You understand how it works.
[00:54:59.952 --> 00:55:02.454]  This model of Glock sales have exploded.
[00:55:02.474 --> 00:55:03.674]  They're selling off store shelves.
[00:55:03.895 --> 00:55:04.575]  People hear about it.
[00:55:04.675 --> 00:55:05.856]  Hey, looks like a good gun.
[00:55:05.896 --> 00:55:07.076]  They might try to ban that gun.
[00:55:07.377 --> 00:55:08.157]  I'm going to go buy one.
[00:55:08.357 --> 00:55:11.899]  Somebody jumps off a big building in a major city like Chicago, New York.
[00:55:12.019 --> 00:55:17.783]  Cops know to go put guards on it the next two days, because nine times out of ten, some other lunatic's going to go, that's a good idea.
[00:55:18.403 --> 00:55:27.630]  It turns out that they kept asking this Congresswoman on TV, nationally and locally, are you afraid that Sarah Palin putting crosshairs on your district means you're going to be killed?
[00:55:27.991 --> 00:55:40.140]  And literally introducing that idea, then you've got a lunatic like Lofner there watching that, who's on hallucinogens almost every day, and then he wants to commit suicide so he thinks he'll go out in a blaze of glory.
[00:55:40.401 --> 00:55:45.545]  They're advertising, just like we have the statistics of death education starting in the 1990s in schools.
[00:55:47.466 --> 00:55:52.453]  Public schools, and then the kids get taught how to commit suicide, and suicide explodes.
[00:55:52.753 --> 00:55:56.038]  They know exactly what they're doing, and Sherman let that slip.
[00:55:56.358 --> 00:56:03.949]  Even if this isn't political, the next one will be, because all this hype, you know there's thousands of nutcases out there, locking and loading right now.
[00:56:05.009 --> 00:56:07.171]  Well, remind me of that Duke story.
[00:56:07.191 --> 00:56:09.173]  You know, the girl that was raped and she lied.
[00:56:09.773 --> 00:56:13.797]  And Jesse Jackson said, well, it doesn't matter if she was raped.
[00:56:14.797 --> 00:56:18.020]  Other black women have been raped for hundreds of years in America.
[00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:18.701]  Wait, wait, wait.
[00:56:19.001 --> 00:56:23.124]  So these guys have to go to jail and have to have their lives destroyed?
[00:56:23.165 --> 00:56:24.546]  What is this madness?
[00:56:25.326 --> 00:56:34.897]  And if you're part of a certain group, you can sit around on your fanny and collect the cash, but just certain words we can't say, certain groups you can't tease.
[00:56:35.537 --> 00:56:36.638]  You can't think like this.
[00:56:37.900 --> 00:56:39.642]  Where is my free country?
[00:56:39.862 --> 00:56:42.805]  And for this, that sheriff is really something.
[00:56:42.845 --> 00:56:44.266]  Boy, that sheriff out of Arizona.
[00:56:45.588 --> 00:56:48.510]  What police book is he learning all this stuff?
[00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:50.272]  How about going out and solving the crime?
[00:56:50.392 --> 00:56:58.258]  What about the self-fulfilling prophecy, though, how they've been hyping, somebody's gonna shoot a politician, somebody's gonna shoot him, they're gonna shoot him!
[00:56:58.498 --> 00:57:00.900]  I mean, they are literally putting the idea out there.
[00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:02.321]  They're the ones generating it.
[00:57:02.962 --> 00:57:08.767]  Well, look, you have kids, I have kids, and you know, you conceive in a little kid, you put him in front of the TV, it doesn't...
[00:57:09.428 --> 00:57:15.253]  It doesn't matter what's on, and it flickers at just the right rate, that syncs up with our brain, and they're drawn into it.
[00:57:15.853 --> 00:57:18.956]  And, you know, I can yell and my kids can't hear me, literally.
[00:57:18.996 --> 00:57:21.098]  I mean, they're not just being rude, they can't hear me.
[00:57:21.758 --> 00:57:26.943]  That TV syncs up with our mind, and smart people are able to tell the difference between
[00:57:27.743 --> 00:57:28.343]  They're hypnotized!
[00:57:52.013 --> 00:58:00.258]  And we now know he was a first person shooter obsessed and this is a disassociative drug where reality and dream become one.
[00:58:00.278 --> 00:58:02.879]  He was literally, that's what a mind control guy does.
[00:58:02.939 --> 00:58:06.021]  They artificially make you sleepwalk in and kill people.
[00:58:06.281 --> 00:58:07.822]  He may have just done this to himself.
[00:58:08.422 --> 00:58:09.682]  Well sure, and he talked about it.
[00:58:09.702 --> 00:58:12.203]  I've read all of his writings, and I'm sure you have.
[00:58:12.643 --> 00:58:15.904]  And look, it's a case of topper on the internet.
[00:58:15.944 --> 00:58:17.404]  Everybody's got to top each other.
[00:58:17.424 --> 00:58:20.745]  And he was playing topper, so he wanted to be more and more extreme.
[00:58:20.785 --> 00:58:25.926]  And there he was, dressed as the Grim Reaper, and he's smoking his salvia and playing the video games.
[00:58:26.006 --> 00:58:33.068]  I mean, look, that guy's about as far away from a Sarah Palin fan, and I'm not a huge Sarah Palin fan.
[00:58:33.088 --> 00:58:33.688]  No, I understand.
[00:58:33.728 --> 00:58:34.948]  Back in 60 seconds, man.
[00:58:34.968 --> 00:58:35.588]  Cal, stay there.
[00:58:35.808 --> 00:58:37.449]  Well, he's going to a Supermax prison now.
[00:58:38.129 --> 00:58:42.790]  The GCN Radio Network, providing the world with hard-hitting talk radio.
[00:58:43.070 --> 00:58:44.871]  GCN.
[00:58:45.431 --> 00:58:47.692]  Great Talk Radio starts here.
[00:58:48.552 --> 00:58:51.853]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:58:52.133 --> 00:58:53.193]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:58:53.253 --> 00:58:57.635]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:58:57.815 --> 00:59:03.456]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:59:03.756 --> 00:59:05.537]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:59:05.677 --> 00:59:06.137]  I think so.
[00:59:22.987 --> 00:59:27.971]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis and you can't eat paper, stocks or metals.
[00:59:28.271 --> 00:59:33.455]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[00:59:33.635 --> 00:59:36.598]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.

[00:59:51.218 --> 00:59:53.119]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:53.599 --> 00:59:56.480]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:02.903 --> 01:00:03.564]  Big Brother.
[01:00:04.224 --> 01:00:05.264]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:05.985 --> 01:00:07.245]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:07.746 --> 01:00:08.566]  You want answers?
[01:00:09.326 --> 01:00:10.307]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:10.867 --> 01:00:14.509]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:15.069 --> 01:00:19.151]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:20.663 --> 01:00:25.730]  Okay, we're talking to Eric Mancow-Muller of mancow.com, Syndicate of Radio Host.
[01:00:25.810 --> 01:00:27.873]  I'm on with him every Wednesday.
[01:00:27.893 --> 01:00:30.116]  Always honored to be there with him in the 8 o'clock central hour.
[01:00:30.477 --> 01:00:35.523]  I wanted to get you on to talk a little bit more, Mancow, here.
[01:00:36.344 --> 01:00:39.127]  ...about this report out of the Chicago Tribune.
[01:00:39.147 --> 01:00:40.549]  There's another one out of the News Gazette.
[01:00:41.009 --> 01:00:44.973]  Last night, the House went 60 to 57, the Senate 30 to 29.
[01:00:45.434 --> 01:00:47.115]  It's going to the governor now.
[01:00:47.556 --> 01:00:56.525]  The biggest tax increase in Illinois history, maybe nationwide, your income tax, already one of the highest in the country for state income tax, is going up 66%
[01:00:59.588 --> 01:01:03.950]  And other states are passing all these taxes, but we're not supposed to get up and get angry.
[01:01:04.050 --> 01:01:14.636]  It came out a few months ago that in Philadelphia, Homeland Security in Pennsylvania was spying on members of the legislature who were in the Tea Party for protesting higher taxes.
[01:01:14.996 --> 01:01:23.300]  The government said that that was a national security threat, that if we take our government back and cut taxes, that cuts off government money, so we're now a threat.
[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:24.341]  So I guess we should...
[01:01:24.701 --> 01:01:28.342]  We need to sit down and say thank you for the 66% tax increase.
[01:01:28.642 --> 01:01:29.602]  You live in Illinois.
[01:01:29.622 --> 01:01:30.742]  I was on your show today.
[01:01:31.062 --> 01:01:32.723]  I heard you saying you're going to leave the state.
[01:01:33.503 --> 01:01:34.163]  I am going to leave.
[01:01:34.223 --> 01:01:35.443]  I've lived here for 10 years.
[01:01:36.243 --> 01:01:37.004]  More than 10 years.
[01:01:37.524 --> 01:01:38.224]  Look, here's the deal.
[01:01:38.264 --> 01:01:39.124]  You can look at Detroit.
[01:01:39.644 --> 01:01:40.564]  You can look at New York.
[01:01:40.804 --> 01:01:42.685]  I mean, Como has come around in New York.
[01:01:43.205 --> 01:01:46.586]  But Alex, here's the deal.
[01:01:46.826 --> 01:01:48.146]  I'm a non-partisan guy.
[01:01:48.186 --> 01:01:49.146]  I'm an independent guy.
[01:01:49.526 --> 01:01:51.027]  I'm a Jeffersonian guy.
[01:01:51.047 --> 01:01:52.047]  I'm a Constitution guy.
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:54.501]  Here's what happens in the big cities.
[01:01:54.521 --> 01:01:56.982]  You live in Austin, let me school you on the big cities, okay?
[01:01:57.442 --> 01:02:02.064]  You have the dummy crafts that promise everything to the people that don't work.
[01:02:02.224 --> 01:02:03.245]  They promise everything.
[01:02:04.125 --> 01:02:08.767]  And so therefore, more and more move to that city.
[01:02:09.827 --> 01:02:11.088]  Detroit, New York, Chicago.
[01:02:11.128 --> 01:02:14.370]  More and more, more and more, and they need more and more, more and more services, more and more.
[01:02:14.890 --> 01:02:17.591]  And so they have to keep jacking up taxes.
[01:02:18.331 --> 01:02:19.412]  All the businesses flee.
[01:02:20.299 --> 01:02:22.841]  So now they need more money, so they jack up the taxes more.
[01:02:22.881 --> 01:02:23.621]  More people leave.
[01:02:23.981 --> 01:02:24.742]  People like me.
[01:02:25.262 --> 01:02:28.484]  And finally, you have a burnt-out shell that looks like Beirut.
[01:02:29.365 --> 01:02:30.065]  Downtown St.
[01:02:30.105 --> 01:02:30.946]  Louis is another one.
[01:02:31.346 --> 01:02:34.768]  You can't live downtown, so you just have a bunch of people that don't work.
[01:02:36.229 --> 01:02:44.174]  Look, hey, I was there, 50 feet away from Oblablab, when he walked out in Grant Park, Chicago, after he was elected.
[01:02:44.194 --> 01:02:47.877]  Remember that big Roman Coliseum they built for him?
[01:02:48.982 --> 01:02:51.904]  And I was with a group of people and they were saying, we don't have to work anymore!
[01:02:52.264 --> 01:02:53.185]  We don't have to work!
[01:02:53.805 --> 01:02:55.987]  And I was laughing, thinking, wow, how stupid is that?
[01:02:56.027 --> 01:02:56.967]  What do you mean you don't have to work?
[01:02:57.428 --> 01:02:58.368]  Well, guess what, Alex?
[01:02:59.209 --> 01:02:59.969]  I was wrong.
[01:02:59.989 --> 01:03:01.631]  They don't have to work anymore.
[01:03:02.231 --> 01:03:03.352]  I just have to work harder.
[01:03:03.472 --> 01:03:04.973]  And Ayn Rand was right.
[01:03:06.093 --> 01:03:10.937]  You know, the problem with this, the problem with this socialism is eventually you run out of the workers' money.
[01:03:11.893 --> 01:03:13.014]  Uh, they've taken enough.
[01:03:13.094 --> 01:03:18.057]  They've taken enough blood from this stone, and I'm moving to a different beach.
[01:03:18.077 --> 01:03:22.540]  66% income tax raised, and I never got to vote on it, and that's it.
[01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:29.704]  They just steal and steal, and somehow if you say, I don't want to give you more money, well then you're not considered noble.
[01:03:29.724 --> 01:03:33.526]  But it's noble for me to work while another man sits around.
[01:03:33.987 --> 01:03:34.567]  I'm fed up.
[01:03:35.796 --> 01:03:40.679]  Well, what's amazing about it, my man Cal, as you know, is that's what world government's about.
[01:03:40.719 --> 01:03:41.099]  The U.N.
[01:03:41.179 --> 01:03:48.503]  actually says they want a world government so there's nowhere to run and they can just raise taxes, raise taxes, raise taxes.
[01:03:48.823 --> 01:03:56.587]  And you've got these cities competing with each other for how many armies of welfare people they can get into them to give them more services.
[01:03:57.588 --> 01:03:59.909]  And now they want our guns, they want our free speech.
[01:04:00.249 --> 01:04:02.811]  But as you said earlier, people are really waking up
[01:04:03.571 --> 01:04:11.377]  Well, and then you have a situation like this, and you see how the media incorrectly is playing it.
[01:04:11.878 --> 01:04:14.460]  I'm sorry, uh, me and you talking about...
[01:04:15.208 --> 01:04:19.790]  Them taking 66% more without a vote, without me wanting to be part of this.
[01:04:20.411 --> 01:04:22.672]  It's thievery and there's nothing wrong.
[01:04:22.712 --> 01:04:26.294]  In fact, I think it's very patriotic what you and I and others are doing.
[01:04:27.214 --> 01:04:28.375]  They're spending our money.
[01:04:28.395 --> 01:04:30.836]  Well, look, look, a billion dollars to rebuild Gaza.
[01:04:30.896 --> 01:04:37.459]  Why are we rebuilding Gaza so that radicalized Muslims can shoot rockets into school buses filled with Jewish children?
[01:04:37.719 --> 01:04:40.901]  Why do I have to rebuild Gaza after they destroy it?
[01:04:41.301 --> 01:04:43.004]  Eric Mankow Muller, we're out of time.
[01:04:43.044 --> 01:04:45.268]  Look forward to speaking to you again very soon.
[01:04:46.130 --> 01:04:46.771]  Take care, buddy.
[01:04:47.172 --> 01:04:49.396]  Gerald Cilente coming up straight ahead.
[01:04:49.436 --> 01:04:51.419]  We'll cover what's happening across the board.
[01:04:59.477 --> 01:05:03.101]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:05:03.501 --> 01:05:06.505]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:05:06.745 --> 01:05:11.510]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:05:11.530 --> 01:05:17.757]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:05:17.917 --> 01:05:20.180]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:20.980]  Tim Geithner?
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:21.420]  Bernanke?
[01:05:21.521 --> 01:05:22.281]  They're arsonists!
[01:05:22.321 --> 01:05:23.242]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:05:23.282 --> 01:05:25.703]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:05:39.591 --> 01:05:41.432]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:05:41.452 --> 01:05:46.516]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:05:46.876 --> 01:05:55.982]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[01:06:22.094 --> 01:06:28.299]  Since 1947, Calvin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.

[01:06:51.468 --> 01:06:51.908]  Thank you!
[01:06:57.657 --> 01:07:01.880]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:02.481]  Number 1.
[01:07:03.121 --> 01:07:06.263]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:06.544 --> 01:07:07.104]  Number 2.
[01:07:07.404 --> 01:07:11.948]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:07:12.288 --> 01:07:12.748]  It's true.
[01:07:13.048 --> 01:07:17.592]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:07:17.912 --> 01:07:18.452]  Number 3.
[01:07:18.733 --> 01:07:22.015]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:07:22.315 --> 01:07:26.018]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:07:26.218 --> 01:07:26.758]  Number 4.
[01:07:27.019 --> 01:07:29.380]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:07:29.781 --> 01:07:33.163]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:07:33.463 --> 01:07:33.663]  Number 5.
[01:07:34.244 --> 01:07:38.166]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:07:38.407 --> 01:07:43.150]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:07:43.450 --> 01:07:47.474]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:47.614 --> 01:07:49.176]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:49.396 --> 01:07:51.478]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[01:07:54.461 --> 01:08:03.330]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:03.650 --> 01:08:05.952]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:22.792 --> 01:08:27.817]  We are now eight minutes into the second hour of this live broadcast.
[01:08:27.897 --> 01:08:30.519]  It is the twelfth day of January 2011.
[01:08:33.632 --> 01:08:41.614]  Top Trends Forecaster joined us late last year in December and now it's his first visit with us in 2011.
[01:08:42.195 --> 01:08:45.516]  Gerald Salente, founder of the Trends Research Institute in 1980.
[01:08:46.136 --> 01:08:48.257]  Gerald is a pioneer trend strategist.
[01:08:48.697 --> 01:08:54.238]  He's the author of several national bestsellers and the website is TrendsResearch.com.
[01:08:54.859 --> 01:08:58.840]  Obviously, Gerald, you know what the big story, the big issue is.
[01:08:59.860 --> 01:09:12.875]  It's not just the federal judge, a pro-Second Amendment judge, Roehl being shot in the face and killed, or this poor Congresswoman Giffords being shot through the brain but surviving, and it looks like may recover.
[01:09:14.181 --> 01:09:14.361]  I think?
[01:09:34.119 --> 01:09:36.020]  It appears that the best M.O.
[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:38.921]  we've got is he was obsessed with the Congresswoman.
[01:09:40.701 --> 01:09:55.406]  So not only what happened with the shooting, but now this move to restrict free speech right on the heels of the FCC announcing Internet controls, right on the heels of all these calls to restrict free speech, Second Amendment.
[01:09:55.746 --> 01:10:01.148]  It looks like the system really wants to use this to clamp down, but I've got the national polls out.
[01:10:01.648 --> 01:10:02.689]  No one is buying it.
[01:10:02.729 --> 01:10:03.109]  In fact,
[01:10:04.076 --> 01:10:09.660]  The polls are showing that people are becoming even more pro-Second Amendment after watching this.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.283]  It seems like anything the mainstream media touches is turning to dust.
[01:10:14.943 --> 01:10:20.807]  Instead of having the Midas touch, they've got the touch of death here.
[01:10:21.587 --> 01:10:24.569]  The system appears really in trouble.
[01:10:24.850 --> 01:10:26.571]  Give us your breakdown on the whole situation.
[01:10:27.611 --> 01:10:29.492]  I think you've summed it up accurately.
[01:10:30.353 --> 01:10:38.558]  As we also know, this kid from the reports, he wasn't watching news or listening to talk radio.
[01:10:39.299 --> 01:10:41.560]  Just as they did with 9-11, Alex.
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:45.043]  They'll use any excuse they can to clamp down on freedom.
[01:10:45.843 --> 01:10:49.944]  It's one of the top trends that we're looking at, loss of liberty in 2011.
[01:10:50.924 --> 01:11:01.266]  The piece, by the way, is... The Trends Journal will be out in a week or so, and the piece is written by Paul Craig Roberts on this very issue.
[01:11:01.826 --> 01:11:14.389]  So the trend to take our freedoms away from us has long been in the making, and they're going to use this excuse from this sick kid as an excuse to take more away from us.
[01:11:15.069 --> 01:11:22.014]  So, the other important thing to understand, however, is that what the people want doesn't count.
[01:11:22.615 --> 01:11:30.861]  You look at poll after poll, they do what they want, whether it was the TARP bailouts or abrogating our constitutional rights.
[01:11:31.442 --> 01:11:34.584]  So, it's going to be a fight for freedom to the end.
[01:11:35.645 --> 01:11:37.046]  Continue along that line.
[01:11:40.034 --> 01:11:41.715]  Well, they're not going to stop.
[01:11:41.915 --> 01:11:48.941]  As we saw with this piece of legislation, they're trying to push through with what they call net neutrality.
[01:11:49.721 --> 01:11:52.223]  Orwell couldn't have come up with a better name.
[01:11:52.904 --> 01:11:56.506]  And then look what's going on on the other aspects.
[01:11:56.867 --> 01:12:06.534]  They've brought Afghanistan and Pakistan to the good old USA with drones flying over our cities in Miami and in Houston.
[01:12:06.954 --> 01:12:12.237]  Peering in your windows, following us to see who's good and who's bad.
[01:12:12.937 --> 01:12:28.946]  We saw our esteemed Secretary of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano, the Czarette, making a deal with Walmart to follow every move and have people rat us out.
[01:12:29.887 --> 01:12:53.527]  I encourage everyone to go and look up that video on YouTube of Janet Napolitano beginning it by saying that Homeland Security starts in your hometown and that if you see anything in the Walmart store or Walmart parking lot to contact your authorities or your Walmart manager.
[01:12:53.587 --> 01:12:55.448]  Yeah, some guy making $62.50 a week in Irenia.
[01:12:57.370 --> 01:13:01.033]  I mean, yeah, like he's gonna help solve the big problem.
[01:13:01.413 --> 01:13:15.022]  That notwithstanding, when you watch the video, the only thing missing is a heavy German accent from World War II era, because that's exactly what it sounds like.
[01:13:15.562 --> 01:13:17.924]  And then I, the other question becomes,
[01:13:18.764 --> 01:13:20.946]  All of this security to watch us?
[01:13:21.486 --> 01:13:24.968]  Who's watching these people that are watching us?
[01:13:25.489 --> 01:13:34.535]  What twisted brains out there are peering in our windows and seeing whether or not we're abiding by the law?
[01:13:35.335 --> 01:13:39.258]  So, the fact of the matter is, Alex, this is the way it goes.
[01:13:39.638 --> 01:13:41.099]  It's old news to us.
[01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:46.983]  We put it in chapter and verse in earlier Trend Alerts and Trends journals.
[01:13:48.084 --> 01:14:00.052]  As the economy continues to decline, as they continue to lose more and more control, America takes on the aspects of a third world nation.
[01:14:00.652 --> 01:14:04.555]  They take the lowest common denominator of society.
[01:14:05.175 --> 01:14:09.278]  The people that couldn't get jobs flipping hamburgers at McDonald's
[01:14:09.878 --> 01:14:12.800]  These are the people they put out there for the goon squad.
[01:14:13.140 --> 01:14:15.341]  You see them when you go to the airport.
[01:14:15.642 --> 01:14:17.783]  These aren't the best and the brightest.
[01:14:18.063 --> 01:14:19.644]  Let's get this really straight.
[01:14:20.084 --> 01:14:24.007]  All of a sudden now, they become the people to feel you up.
[01:14:24.607 --> 01:14:29.870]  And they become the people who have no lives of their own to exert control over you.
[01:14:29.910 --> 01:14:33.493]  Well, Gerald, that's what I've noticed coming in and out of the country or flying.
[01:14:33.513 --> 01:14:35.294]  A lot of these people
[01:14:36.559 --> 01:14:38.479]  It's like they're trying to act thuggish.
[01:14:38.499 --> 01:14:39.960]  They're trying to intimidate you.
[01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:44.641]  They're trying to bug their eyes out at old women and people with kids.
[01:14:45.541 --> 01:14:47.401]  Most of them can hardly speak English.
[01:14:47.461 --> 01:14:52.523]  I noticed they're, you know, hiring people from police state nations that this is their status now.
[01:14:52.583 --> 01:14:55.283]  They came from places with sewage running down the streets.
[01:14:55.343 --> 01:14:56.804]  And I've been all over the world.
[01:14:56.884 --> 01:14:58.284]  You are very well traveled.
[01:14:58.744 --> 01:15:18.897]  And growing up we knew third world countries had cops that acted thuggish and guys with machine guns on corners and now that's coming to America but with high-tech telescreens saying watch your neighbor and now they're on the news saying we want to pass laws that if anything you say might upset other people
[01:15:20.103 --> 01:15:28.910]  You're going to be arrested, and by the way, we want your guns, and by the way, we're going to blame this on anybody that's criticizing the Federal Reserve.
[01:15:28.930 --> 01:15:35.016]  I mean, they've named Ron Paul and myself on multiple programs all over print media, TV.
[01:15:35.036 --> 01:15:37.438]  I mean, this is blood libel.
[01:15:37.818 --> 01:15:38.799]  I mean, Sarah Palin
[01:15:39.239 --> 01:15:39.559]  I don't know.
[01:15:57.847 --> 01:15:59.328]  When was it less heated?
[01:15:59.868 --> 01:16:05.752]  Back in those calm days when political figures literally settled their differences with dueling pistols?
[01:16:06.072 --> 01:16:24.584]  Since when are we collectively guilty and have to give up our rights and not criticize government when some guy who had literally took a hallucinogen, quote, almost every day and was, quote, a liberal and, quote, obsessed with her and put letters from her to him in his safe?
[01:16:25.104 --> 01:16:26.805]  I mean, this guy was, you know,
[01:16:27.185 --> 01:16:28.686]  Missing every knife in the drawer.
[01:16:28.746 --> 01:16:30.706]  His elevator didn't even go up one floor.
[01:16:31.127 --> 01:16:34.788]  And then I get to take the blame for this?
[01:16:35.188 --> 01:16:36.249]  And look at Illinois.
[01:16:36.709 --> 01:16:39.070]  A 66% income tax increase.
[01:16:39.970 --> 01:16:41.471]  They just passed it last night.
[01:16:41.971 --> 01:16:43.632]  Everybody's fleeing that place.
[01:16:43.892 --> 01:16:45.632]  It's going to look like Detroit if they keep it up.
[01:16:45.873 --> 01:16:47.173]  I mean, where is this going?
[01:16:47.233 --> 01:16:49.114]  It's insanity, Gerald.
[01:16:50.701 --> 01:16:53.562]  As I said, we're moving into third world status.
[01:16:53.923 --> 01:16:55.283]  There are a lot of indicators.
[01:16:55.323 --> 01:16:56.364]  This isn't rhetoric.
[01:16:56.784 --> 01:17:06.367]  When I say this, you have it, for example, the gap between the rich and the poor is the widest in the United States of any of the industrialized nations.
[01:17:06.788 --> 01:17:09.389]  You just mentioned Chicago, Illinois.
[01:17:09.849 --> 01:17:17.272]  That's the highest corporate tax rate, by the way, when you put state and federal on it, probably in the world.
[01:17:18.172 --> 01:17:22.497]  So this is what they're doing, and we're seeing the results of it.
[01:17:23.118 --> 01:17:32.929]  You're going to start seeing more and more outbreaks of violence, whether it's somebody out of their mind like this guy, or people just fed up.
[01:17:33.250 --> 01:17:33.870]  By the way,
[01:17:34.831 --> 01:17:37.612]  Uh, right up here in good old Kingston, New York.
[01:17:37.672 --> 01:17:50.558]  You know, I used to talk about that bank, the key bank I had trouble getting my money out of when they wouldn't give it to me because I wanted to keep it but for myself and didn't want them to hold it.
[01:17:51.159 --> 01:17:53.580]  And I mentioned that they got robbed twice.
[01:17:54.380 --> 01:17:55.041]  Bingo!
[01:17:56.161 --> 01:18:00.863]  Three times in two years, they had another one this week.
[01:18:01.443 --> 01:18:05.925]  I could literally throw a stone and hit this bank.
[01:18:06.005 --> 01:18:07.446]  That's how close it is.
[01:18:07.866 --> 01:18:15.509]  You're going to see more and more of a breakdown, and as the breakdown gets worse, they're going to clamp down harder.
[01:18:16.289 --> 01:18:19.390]  Because they're going to say we have to stop.
[01:18:19.610 --> 01:18:23.831]  It's going to be the campaign slogan, mark my words, of 2012.
[01:18:24.312 --> 01:18:27.073]  We got to get tough on crime.
[01:18:27.573 --> 01:18:34.415]  So as the system breaks down more, they're going to bring in more of the goon squads to keep us in check.
[01:18:34.975 --> 01:18:44.401]  Well, you notice what they've been politically building is it's a paramilitary army designed for the milk cows, those of us that are law-abiding, pay the taxes.
[01:18:44.901 --> 01:18:48.964]  They're actually hiring a lot of the criminals now, just like the Nazis and the Soviets did.
[01:18:49.004 --> 01:18:51.125]  That's coming out to fill their ranks.
[01:18:51.785 --> 01:18:54.307]  And I've seen all over the country where they'll lay off
[01:18:55.205 --> 01:18:55.905]  Twenty percent.
[01:18:56.245 --> 01:18:56.585]  Forty.
[01:18:56.746 --> 01:18:59.606]  Over sixty in some counties of the sheriff's deputies.
[01:18:59.727 --> 01:19:02.507]  And then announce what the sheriff's deputies were keeping.
[01:19:02.828 --> 01:19:04.508]  They're going to be revenue generation.
[01:19:04.748 --> 01:19:08.389]  They're not going to come respond to serious crimes like armed robbery.
[01:19:08.650 --> 01:19:11.330]  Now even the Oakland police chief last year was talking about that.
[01:19:11.610 --> 01:19:15.492]  So they're telling you the cops are there to get your money, not to help you.
[01:19:16.252 --> 01:19:23.999]  Well, of course, as I've said, and we'll be writing about it more in the Trends Journal, the police have become the enforcers for the crime bosses.
[01:19:24.539 --> 01:19:26.260]  The big guys are off-limits.
[01:19:26.561 --> 01:19:34.667]  Have you seen any heads roll from Wall Street and all these criminal bank scams?
[01:19:35.028 --> 01:19:37.830]  And I love the white-shoe boy language they use.
[01:19:38.371 --> 01:19:39.932]  Robo-signers.
[01:19:40.212 --> 01:19:40.672]  Stay there!
[01:19:40.732 --> 01:19:41.573]  Stay there, Gerald!
[01:19:41.673 --> 01:19:42.054]  Got him!
[01:19:42.794 --> 01:19:43.655]  Hey, to interrupt, gotta break.
[01:19:43.675 --> 01:19:44.236]  We're gonna come back.
[01:19:44.276 --> 01:19:47.198]  Let's start off there with the economy, with the fraud.
[01:19:47.759 --> 01:19:51.042]  I've got CNBC right here calling in your prediction.
[01:19:51.102 --> 01:19:51.602]  It's true.
[01:19:52.143 --> 01:19:54.845]  Housing market slips into depression territory.
[01:19:55.146 --> 01:19:56.307]  We've been there for a long time.
[01:19:58.573 --> 01:20:01.856]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[01:20:02.657 --> 01:20:06.902]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[01:20:07.162 --> 01:20:13.088]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[01:20:13.328 --> 01:20:15.470]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[01:20:15.751 --> 01:20:21.717]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[01:20:21.837 --> 01:20:25.180]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[01:20:25.241 --> 01:20:26.942]  There is no other program of its kind.
[01:20:27.122 --> 01:20:29.165]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[01:20:29.305 --> 01:20:33.970]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.
[01:20:34.190 --> 01:20:34.810]  Guaranteed.
[01:20:35.011 --> 01:20:39.055]  Prevent wage garnishments, bank levies, and stop collection calls with our proven program.
[01:20:39.275 --> 01:20:44.076]  Call Zero Debt in 90 days now, 800-477-9256, and ask for free information from an expert who also completed our program.
[01:20:44.096 --> 01:20:45.237]  800-477-9256 or ZeroDebtGuarantee.com.
[01:20:45.257 --> 01:20:45.957]  800-477-9256 or ZeroDebtGuarantee.com.
[01:20:59.252 --> 01:21:02.893]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:21:03.253 --> 01:21:06.274]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:21:06.514 --> 01:21:11.275]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:21:11.295 --> 01:21:17.537]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:21:17.697 --> 01:21:19.938]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:21:20.478 --> 01:21:20.758]  Tim Geithner?
[01:21:20.778 --> 01:21:21.018]  Bernanke?
[01:21:21.038 --> 01:21:21.578]  They're arsonists!
[01:21:21.598 --> 01:21:22.579]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:21:22.619 --> 01:21:24.740]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:21:39.386 --> 01:21:41.207]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:21:41.507 --> 01:21:46.289]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:21:46.649 --> 01:21:55.833]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:21:57.918 --> 01:22:01.563]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[01:22:01.983 --> 01:22:07.410]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[01:22:07.871 --> 01:22:08.932]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[01:22:08.972 --> 01:22:12.977]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:22:13.678 --> 01:22:27.030]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[01:22:27.471 --> 01:22:32.796]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[01:22:33.096 --> 01:22:38.921]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[01:22:39.722 --> 01:22:40.983]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:41.003 --> 01:22:42.503]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[01:22:42.523 --> 01:22:42.963]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:42.983 --> 01:22:45.164]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[01:22:45.184 --> 01:22:45.244]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:57.438 --> 01:23:03.882]  One of the most potent ways to lower blood pressure is to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme in the body, also called ACE.
[01:23:04.243 --> 01:23:08.465]  In nature, there are a group of proteins found in unheated whey that inhibit the ACE enzyme.
[01:23:08.826 --> 01:23:11.627]  The most potent ACE inhibitor to date is Lactokinin.
[01:23:12.028 --> 01:23:22.455]  While Lactokinin does not have the inhibitory potency of synthetic drugs commonly used in the treatment of hypertension, this naturally occurring whey peptide may be able to help keep blood pressure normal.
[01:23:22.955 --> 01:23:26.818]  The most powerful whey protein supplement on the market is One World Whey.
[01:23:27.118 --> 01:23:31.822]  One World Whey is the first ever unheated whey protein powder from grass-fed cows.
[01:23:32.583 --> 01:23:35.405]  One World Whey is easily digested and tastes delicious.
[01:23:36.086 --> 01:23:42.431]  Use One World Whey to support your exercise or weight loss goals, your optimal blood pressure, energy, endurance, and mood.
[01:23:42.871 --> 01:23:43.992]  To order, call 888-988-3325.
[01:23:44.052 --> 01:23:44.352]  That's 888-988-3325.
[01:23:47.995 --> 01:23:49.038]  988-3325 or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[01:23:49.058 --> 01:23:50.061]  That's OneWorldWHEY.com.
[01:23:58.294 --> 01:24:09.218]  Bill Clinton has come out with another statement saying politics must change after the shooting.
[01:24:10.058 --> 01:24:23.163]  But now, CNN, MSNBC and others are reporting, talking to friends and family, he hated politics, saw himself as apolitical, and was basically obsessed with her.
[01:24:23.803 --> 01:24:24.904]  And that's what our article
[01:24:26.289 --> 01:24:35.783]  Up on PrisonPlanet.com says, on Sunday I called him as a nihilistic guy rejected by women into the occult to shock people.
[01:24:36.344 --> 01:24:38.087]  Just like Eric Muller said earlier.
[01:24:39.912 --> 01:24:41.033]  It's a game called Topper.
[01:24:41.453 --> 01:24:44.195]  They're trying to top each other and how radical they are.
[01:24:44.215 --> 01:24:48.398]  And he started taking a high-powered hallucinogen, quote, almost every day.
[01:24:49.038 --> 01:24:52.180]  That's his neighbors, his friends, his family, the Associated Press reporting.
[01:24:53.942 --> 01:24:59.485]  And it goes on to report, was the shooter in love with Congresswoman Giffords.
[01:25:00.526 --> 01:25:01.907]  Now the new headline up at Drudge.
[01:25:02.207 --> 01:25:03.608]  He did not watch TV.
[01:25:03.708 --> 01:25:04.889]  He disliked the news.
[01:25:05.289 --> 01:25:07.191]  He didn't listen to political radio.
[01:25:09.192 --> 01:25:13.333]  That is being reported here, and I want to get back into the economy.
[01:25:13.373 --> 01:25:16.714]  This is a short segment, but you got cut off by the break, Gerald Solente.
[01:25:16.754 --> 01:25:24.457]  You were starting to get into the things that are happening, but it's so incredible to actually see them
[01:25:25.177 --> 01:25:36.544]  From within hours of this happening, trying to blame anybody who is seen as promoting lower taxes, smaller government, and the Tea Party movement, which the Republicans have tried to take over but unsuccessfully.
[01:25:37.025 --> 01:25:38.746]  I mean, these really are authoritarians.
[01:25:38.766 --> 01:25:41.027]  They really are trying to end free speech.
[01:25:41.047 --> 01:25:42.168]  Do you think they're going to be successful?
[01:25:43.132 --> 01:25:44.413]  They are successful.
[01:25:44.913 --> 01:25:46.494]  Look at the mainstream media.
[01:25:46.514 --> 01:25:50.017]  They're nothing more than shills for Washington.
[01:25:50.817 --> 01:25:53.319]  But they're not going to be successful in the long term.
[01:25:53.719 --> 01:25:55.261]  Again, it's a give and take.
[01:25:55.521 --> 01:26:00.424]  As you know, one of the top trends for 2011 is Journalism 2.0.
[01:26:00.965 --> 01:26:01.605]  And you're it.
[01:26:02.125 --> 01:26:02.606]  And I'm it.
[01:26:03.186 --> 01:26:07.849]  And it's all of these other it's out there that are putting out a different message.
[01:26:08.269 --> 01:26:13.833]  So as the message gets out there more and more, they clamp down on it more and more.
[01:26:14.354 --> 01:26:16.775]  So it's going to be a fight.
[01:26:17.476 --> 01:26:26.221]  In the end, we believe, however, that the voices such as yours and mine and many others is going to ring much louder than theirs.
[01:26:26.562 --> 01:26:33.046]  Because when you look at all of the polls coming in, people are losing their faith in the mainstream media.
[01:26:33.346 --> 01:26:41.169]  And again, they're going to use any excuse they can to clamp down on any message that they don't want to hear.
[01:26:41.329 --> 01:26:42.549]  And here's the deal.
[01:26:42.709 --> 01:26:51.453]  With True TV, Time Warner, we've now confirmed they did kill that episode on Police State under Homeland Security threats behind the scenes.
[01:26:51.773 --> 01:26:53.393]  The government didn't want this out in the open.
[01:26:53.413 --> 01:26:54.814]  They're threatening people to keep it secret.
[01:26:55.214 --> 01:27:00.416]  Now they've ordered all the DVR distributors to erase all the seasons last year and this year.
[01:27:01.076 --> 01:27:03.497]  And they're starting to not air the old episodes as much.
[01:27:03.877 --> 01:27:14.982]  I mean, if they can get away with killing Ventura's TV show, and there's not any mainstream media coverage on it, why not kill all of the alternative media, or alternative information that gets on mainstream media?
[01:27:15.262 --> 01:27:16.702]  I mean, this is really happening.
[01:27:17.322 --> 01:27:18.083]  It is happening.
[01:27:18.763 --> 01:27:20.944]  And it's going to continue, as I said.
[01:27:21.404 --> 01:27:28.447]  The more the economy declines, you were just, at the break, you mentioned a piece that just came out on CNBC.
[01:27:30.543 --> 01:27:30.824]  Yes.
[01:27:31.566 --> 01:27:32.108]  What was it?
[01:27:33.226 --> 01:27:34.007]  About housing?
[01:27:34.607 --> 01:27:35.367]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:27:35.407 --> 01:27:37.608]  In fact, that's what we're going to get to next, and then I digress.
[01:27:37.648 --> 01:27:51.416]  Its housing market slips into depression territory, and it says, as the economy revs back to life, I thought the recession ended a year and a half ago, with signs of hiring on the horizon, the housing market is being left behind.
[01:27:52.076 --> 01:28:02.042]  And it goes on to say, in the past few years, we've been careful to choose the words carefully, not calling it a recession until it fit the technical definition and avoiding any inappropriate use of the D word, depression.
[01:28:02.662 --> 01:28:10.646]  And then they go on to say, but now, looking at the numbers, we have to report that this is a depressionary situation.
[01:28:10.906 --> 01:28:16.048]  And that's them saying depression with cooked numbers, Gerald.
[01:28:16.579 --> 01:28:16.899]  I know.
[01:28:17.239 --> 01:28:19.401]  And let's get a couple of things straight here.
[01:28:19.981 --> 01:28:29.647]  Number one, all the money the federal government has put on our shoulders to boost up this phony housing market to begin with.
[01:28:30.368 --> 01:28:38.513]  Number two, remember all the tax breaks they gave the people to buy those homes, to sucker them into the market.
[01:28:38.893 --> 01:28:41.855]  A Ponzi scheme that we paid for.
[01:28:42.655 --> 01:28:54.022]  Number three, as you read that propaganda that you just read, as the employment numbers rev up, let's get this straight.
[01:28:54.722 --> 01:29:03.727]  When they began this stimulus package under Obama, they said they were going to create four million jobs.
[01:29:04.328 --> 01:29:07.710]  Last year, 1.1 million jobs were created.
[01:29:10.191 --> 01:29:22.710]  At that rate, accounting for the new people moving into the system, it would take until 2030 just to get back to levels before the recession began.
[01:29:23.411 --> 01:29:24.292]  Number four.
[01:29:25.914 --> 01:29:38.618]  Obama said, and his brilliant Larry Summers and others, that with the stimulus program, that in 2010, we'd be looking at an unemployment rate of 7.5%.
[01:29:40.578 --> 01:29:41.259]  Another lie!
[01:29:41.299 --> 01:29:41.799]  Stay there!
[01:29:48.561 --> 01:29:49.481]  We're on the march.
[01:29:49.961 --> 01:29:51.482]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:55.161]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:58.191 --> 01:30:01.633]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[01:30:02.033 --> 01:30:06.055]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[01:30:06.295 --> 01:30:10.917]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[01:30:10.997 --> 01:30:16.179]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[01:30:16.939 --> 01:30:20.481]  Not worried about them moving south.
[01:30:20.581 --> 01:30:23.983]  Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[01:30:26.722 --> 01:30:31.667]  I'm looking for America.
[01:30:32.247 --> 01:30:33.749]  We're American and be proud.
[01:30:33.889 --> 01:30:36.431]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[01:30:36.491 --> 01:30:40.695]  The land I left free and the home of the brave.
[01:30:41.116 --> 01:30:44.839]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[01:30:52.685 --> 01:30:57.326]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[01:30:58.247 --> 01:31:01.548]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[01:31:01.808 --> 01:31:02.888]  It ended on June of 2009.
[01:31:02.948 --> 01:31:07.310]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[01:31:07.510 --> 01:31:13.171]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[01:31:13.451 --> 01:31:15.432]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[01:31:15.592 --> 01:31:18.273]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[01:31:18.633 --> 01:31:24.918]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[01:31:25.138 --> 01:31:26.939]  They both make fabulous investments.
[01:31:27.339 --> 01:31:32.403]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[01:31:32.683 --> 01:31:37.687]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[01:31:37.967 --> 01:31:43.191]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[01:31:43.331 --> 01:31:44.872]  This will freeze the cost of your food
[01:31:44.932 --> 01:31:45.432]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:31:45.452 --> 01:31:49.133]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:31:49.153 --> 01:31:51.194]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:13.421]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:32:13.621 --> 01:32:16.402]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:32:16.662 --> 01:32:18.782]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:32:18.982 --> 01:32:24.903]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:32:25.224 --> 01:32:28.424]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:32:28.604 --> 01:32:34.125]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:32:34.385 --> 01:32:35.686]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:32:36.026 --> 01:32:37.166]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:32:37.346 --> 01:32:39.868]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:32:39.988 --> 01:32:44.051]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:32:44.232 --> 01:32:48.715]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:32:48.855 --> 01:32:51.297]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[01:33:04.798 --> 01:33:15.685]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[01:33:19.888 --> 01:33:22.630]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:25.232 --> 01:33:27.954]  What Gerald Salente was just getting into is so important.
[01:33:27.974 --> 01:33:33.898]  It's not just that you're sliding into a depression in the last two years, according to every real economic measurement.
[01:33:35.134 --> 01:33:38.938]  But that they continue to lie about it and change their stories weekly.
[01:33:38.958 --> 01:33:44.825]  We're going to be discussing some of their quote predictions that have all proven to be lies.
[01:33:45.105 --> 01:33:45.946]  They know they're lying.
[01:33:46.227 --> 01:33:52.133]  Versus what Gerald Cilente, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts and so many others have documented here on this broadcast.
[01:33:53.134 --> 01:33:55.736]  We're going back to Gerald Cilente here in just a moment.
[01:33:56.196 --> 01:33:59.678]  First, I wanted to tell you about the wonderful folks at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:34:00.439 --> 01:34:05.241]  It's high quality, made right here in America, non-GMO, non-hybrid, storable food.
[01:34:05.622 --> 01:34:07.503]  They have a lot of different food lines.
[01:34:07.823 --> 01:34:10.584]  It's all been packaged in the last week to the last month.
[01:34:10.925 --> 01:34:12.806]  You're not buying some old 5, 10-year-old junk.
[01:34:14.047 --> 01:34:16.169]  They've got gourmet pre-made meals.
[01:34:16.189 --> 01:34:17.231]  They've got basic stuff.
[01:34:17.251 --> 01:34:18.031]  They've got everything.
[01:34:18.372 --> 01:34:19.713]  efoodsdirect.com.
[01:34:19.733 --> 01:34:22.416]  You'll never stand in a bread line if you own your own bread.
[01:34:22.436 --> 01:34:26.581]  It is crazy to not have storable foods in the type of world that we're headed into.
[01:34:26.821 --> 01:34:27.622]  I have storable foods.
[01:34:27.642 --> 01:34:28.403]  This is where I got them.
[01:34:28.704 --> 01:34:29.665]  efoodsdirect.com.
[01:34:29.685 --> 01:34:29.725]  800-409-5633.
[01:34:33.068 --> 01:34:36.971]  Continuing, Diamond Gusset jeans made in America.
[01:34:36.991 --> 01:34:39.012]  They got regular jeans, motorcycle jeans.
[01:34:39.472 --> 01:34:43.674]  They look like Levi's, but they don't tear out in a month like Levi's now do, made in Mexico.
[01:34:43.734 --> 01:34:44.575]  Levi's used to be great.
[01:34:45.355 --> 01:34:47.277]  They've got a wide spectrum of great products.
[01:34:47.657 --> 01:34:50.899]  They've got a special running at gusset.com forward slash America.
[01:34:51.499 --> 01:35:00.703]  Where when you get a certain amount of jeans, you get three free gifts including t-shirts, that great country music CD about restoring jobs here in the United States.
[01:35:01.123 --> 01:35:06.685]  Gusset.com forward slash America or 888-8Gusset and tell them you want the Alex Jones special.
[01:35:06.705 --> 01:35:07.385]  888-8Gusset.
[01:35:07.445 --> 01:35:07.885]  And lastly,
[01:35:12.566 --> 01:35:19.610]  You may be awake, I may be awake, but your friends, your family, they're somewhat awake now, but they're not informed yet.
[01:35:20.170 --> 01:35:24.692]  You know, we got awakened years ago, but when you first wake up, you don't quite know what's going on.
[01:35:24.732 --> 01:35:26.413]  Then you've got to assess the situation.
[01:35:26.713 --> 01:35:35.958]  People are now awake, and the media, the old media, the dying media, is there saying, don't criticize taxes exploding at the state level.
[01:35:36.238 --> 01:35:41.041]  Don't criticize the devaluation of the dollar, which is another tax, and your purchasing power.
[01:35:41.781 --> 01:35:45.122]  Don't discuss your Social Security being frozen, even though you paid into it.
[01:35:45.802 --> 01:35:49.583]  Don't discuss the offshore banks getting trillions of dollars and won't tell Congress where it went.
[01:35:50.643 --> 01:35:53.984]  If you don't shut up, it's going to cause shootings.
[01:35:54.264 --> 01:35:56.244]  It's Rush Limbaugh and Alex Jones' fault.
[01:35:56.704 --> 01:35:57.444]  And Michael Savage.
[01:35:58.144 --> 01:35:59.005]  Word for word.
[01:35:59.105 --> 01:36:00.465]  It's our fault.
[01:36:00.625 --> 01:36:01.225]  We're bad.
[01:36:03.005 --> 01:36:07.566]  And then we find out, didn't watch TV, didn't like talk radio, didn't like politics.
[01:36:08.087 --> 01:36:09.987]  He was on drugs, obsessed with her.
[01:36:11.018 --> 01:36:12.019]  Just like I told you Sunday.
[01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:14.841]  Now all confirmed.
[01:36:17.283 --> 01:36:24.870]  And now is the time to go to Infowars.com and get In Game, The Obama Deception, Fall of the Republic.
[01:36:25.090 --> 01:36:27.092]  Both of those films, by the way, have Gerald Cilenta in them.
[01:36:27.892 --> 01:36:30.534]  The Obama Deception came out almost two years ago.
[01:36:31.577 --> 01:36:36.441]  And it laid out everything Obama was going to do and how it would unfold and what would happen.
[01:36:36.681 --> 01:36:41.845]  And people watch it now, it's more powerful than 22 months ago when it came out.
[01:36:43.672 --> 01:36:44.972]  It is freaking people out.
[01:36:45.152 --> 01:36:46.993]  Now that DVD is ready to be seen.
[01:36:47.293 --> 01:36:47.573]  Get it.
[01:36:47.653 --> 01:36:48.173]  Make copies.
[01:36:48.213 --> 01:36:48.854]  Get it out to folks.
[01:36:49.174 --> 01:36:51.114]  Get a PrisonPlanet.TV membership.
[01:36:51.134 --> 01:36:53.975]  We got five months free right now at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:36:54.435 --> 01:36:57.296]  Get Jim Marr's trillion-dollar conspiracy about the banking takeover.
[01:36:57.636 --> 01:37:01.498]  They own it all, including you, by way of toxic debt by Ron McDonald.
[01:37:01.938 --> 01:37:04.198]  And we've got the Alex Jones Essentials special.
[01:37:04.539 --> 01:37:06.059]  Five of my films for $24.95.
[01:37:06.319 --> 01:37:07.419]  That's less than five bucks a piece.
[01:37:07.740 --> 01:37:08.740]  We're getting rid of that soon.
[01:37:09.060 --> 01:37:11.341]  How do I run this operation and this big crew?
[01:37:11.621 --> 01:37:12.061]  How do I
[01:37:12.621 --> 01:37:14.805]  Uh, finish the TV studio, which we're almost done with.
[01:37:14.825 --> 01:37:15.866]  I'm gonna give you a tour of soon.
[01:37:16.167 --> 01:37:18.510]  How do we continue to do what we do here?
[01:37:18.590 --> 01:37:20.433]  Because you buy the books and videos.
[01:37:20.653 --> 01:37:21.815]  But that's only part of it!
[01:37:22.796 --> 01:37:24.038]  The rest of the equation...
[01:37:25.226 --> 01:37:28.909]  is that you take those books and videos and materials and have viewing parties.
[01:37:29.249 --> 01:37:30.830]  Tell your neighbors, you want to know what's going on?
[01:37:31.070 --> 01:37:31.870]  Let's get informed.
[01:37:32.151 --> 01:37:41.997]  Give them to your city council, give them to your police chief, your sheriff, your priest, your pastor, your rabbi, your imam, people that are effective in the community.
[01:37:42.237 --> 01:37:44.118]  You need to educate the educators.
[01:37:45.079 --> 01:37:46.660]  The people are ready to hear the truth.
[01:37:46.720 --> 01:37:50.923]  Visit the online video bookstore at InfoWars.com, the t-shirts, the ball caps.
[01:37:51.363 --> 01:37:52.564]  You want to meet like-minded people?
[01:37:53.663 --> 01:37:55.224]  Wear an InfoWars.com shirt.
[01:37:55.284 --> 01:37:58.787]  Believe me, go to church or go to work or walk down the street and see what happens.
[01:37:59.187 --> 01:38:00.448]  We've got to come together.
[01:38:00.488 --> 01:38:02.189]  We've got to start communicating with each other.
[01:38:02.569 --> 01:38:03.830]  And so it's all symbiotic.
[01:38:04.130 --> 01:38:07.613]  PrisonPlanet.tv, the books, the videos, all of it, InfoWars.com.
[01:38:07.713 --> 01:38:09.974]  Also, support our local affiliates.
[01:38:09.994 --> 01:38:13.337]  We're getting a lot of new AM and FM affiliates all over the country.
[01:38:14.478 --> 01:38:15.639]  And they are wonderful.
[01:38:15.659 --> 01:38:18.862]  A lot of them are huge, big juggernaut stations in major cities.
[01:38:19.462 --> 01:38:20.743]  Support their sponsors.
[01:38:21.124 --> 01:38:22.245]  Support those stations.
[01:38:22.525 --> 01:38:25.067]  Spread the word to your co-workers about the station.
[01:38:25.788 --> 01:38:28.350]  Tell folks in the grocery store line, hey, you're going out in your car?
[01:38:28.650 --> 01:38:30.432]  Tune into this FM or AM station.
[01:38:30.872 --> 01:38:31.593]  That's what I do.
[01:38:31.693 --> 01:38:33.234]  I'm on several stations here in Austin.
[01:38:33.454 --> 01:38:35.256]  I plug them in the grocery store line every day.
[01:38:36.437 --> 01:38:37.418]  They start asking me for it.
[01:38:37.438 --> 01:38:39.619]  You want a loyalty card so we can track you?
[01:38:39.639 --> 01:38:42.402]  You want to... And I'll say, hey, why don't you tune into this radio station?
[01:38:44.031 --> 01:38:44.832]  It's a buzz.
[01:38:44.872 --> 01:38:45.793]  You create a buzz.
[01:38:45.813 --> 01:38:46.814]  The buzz is already there.
[01:38:47.094 --> 01:38:48.296]  We push it into overdrive.
[01:38:48.316 --> 01:38:51.419]  We bring down the globalists in a big way.
[01:38:51.719 --> 01:38:53.962]  You notice they're pushing back right now, but they're scared.
[01:38:54.222 --> 01:39:00.028]  They're trying to intimidate us to shut up because they know that they are not invincible.
[01:39:00.068 --> 01:39:03.031]  In fact, they're weak because they've engaged in so many crimes.
[01:39:03.692 --> 01:39:06.133]  It's also important to support local station sponsors.
[01:39:06.673 --> 01:39:12.235]  It's important to support the people we bring on here, whether it's Ron Paul, Rand Paul, Gerald Salente, you name it.
[01:39:12.515 --> 01:39:22.358]  It's important to check out TrendsResearch.com and subscribe to that important journal as we grow the alternative, real Media 2.0, as Gerald puts it.
[01:39:24.759 --> 01:39:27.702]  You were getting into, so please recap, all their lies.
[01:39:28.002 --> 01:39:29.523]  You've gotten up to point four.
[01:39:29.903 --> 01:39:36.269]  I was reading out of this MSNBC, excuse me, CNBC report, housing market slips into depression territory.
[01:39:36.509 --> 01:39:40.933]  You've been saying that for two plus years, every other economist or trends forecaster we have on.
[01:39:41.213 --> 01:39:43.555]  We know real unemployment's above 22 percent.
[01:39:43.995 --> 01:39:45.537]  They're saying it's 9.7.
[01:39:46.017 --> 01:39:52.803]  And then they have this Orwellian statement here, as the economy revs back into life with signs of hiring on the horizon.
[01:39:53.303 --> 01:39:56.135]  On the horizon, the housing market is being left behind.
[01:39:56.778 --> 01:39:57.983]  What are they talking about?
[01:39:58.043 --> 01:39:58.766]  Please continue.
[01:39:59.636 --> 01:40:27.083]  Well, first of all, I'd like to say that in what you're saying about supporting the people to keep your show running, as you well know, the folks here wear diamond gusset jeans, and we also have our supplies of efoods.com, and it's very important also to re-look at, if you haven't gotten it yet,
[01:40:27.663 --> 01:40:57.443]  The Obama Deception and the Fall of the Republic, and particularly, give it to your Wimpocrat friends, who believed in change you could believe in, and believed in hope, because as you have done so brilliantly in those productions, by bringing the people that you did on, to outline what was going to happen, it's falling out exactly as predicted.
[01:40:58.264 --> 01:41:09.253]  And if you need any more proof of who's running the White House, look who Obama just brought in as his new Chief of Staff.
[01:41:10.094 --> 01:41:13.036]  Another daily from Chicago.
[01:41:13.977 --> 01:41:15.598]  And where did he come from?
[01:41:16.258 --> 01:41:20.641]  Oh, he was the chief lobbyist for JPMorgan Chase.
[01:41:21.161 --> 01:41:24.363]  There's some more change you can believe in.
[01:41:24.903 --> 01:41:34.348]  And you look at the other guy who we just brought in to take over the place of the brilliant Larry Summers, Gene Sperling.
[01:41:34.908 --> 01:41:36.890]  And what was he famous for, huh?
[01:41:38.101 --> 01:41:58.316]  I think it was helping to deregulate the Glass-Steagall Act under the Clinton administration and isn't he a lot of great change because he had the same position under the Clinton administration that he now has with the Obama administration.
[01:41:58.456 --> 01:42:12.975]  With the architects of Glass-Steagall and the tens of trillions in derivatives, 1.5 quadrillion total, impossible to pay back, the Daly's are admittedly the kings of the Irish mafia, going back almost 100 years.
[01:42:16.460 --> 01:42:20.463]  I mean, all these other mafias, the Rahm Emanuel mafia and others running around.
[01:42:20.483 --> 01:42:22.424]  I mean, this is so brazen.
[01:42:22.464 --> 01:42:30.950]  And when you got cut off by the break, you were bringing up in the last two, three years how we were told after the stimulus, after the bailout, it's all going to turn around.
[01:42:30.990 --> 01:42:34.692]  And, oh, we never entered a recession or we left the recession in June of 09.
[01:42:35.213 --> 01:42:39.175]  I mean, they literally can't even get their lives straight.
[01:42:39.235 --> 01:42:41.717]  And they're in there stealing with both hands.
[01:42:42.117 --> 01:42:46.140]  And Obama's out saying, I'm not going to hire some Wall Street insiders when that's
[01:42:46.340 --> 01:42:47.101]  That's all he's doing!
[01:42:47.121 --> 01:42:48.181]  I know.
[01:42:48.922 --> 01:43:07.196]  Again, you know, everyone should, everyone should get copies of the Obama deception and follow the Republic and distribute them to everyone that you know, because the facts are there, how they began to lie and continue to lie.
[01:43:07.696 --> 01:43:13.440]  So as we go forward here, and you know, I've been criticized, I want to make this really clear.
[01:43:14.221 --> 01:43:17.043]  We never said there would be a stock market crash.
[01:43:17.183 --> 01:43:22.806]  In 2010, I said that there would be a global financial crash of some sort.
[01:43:23.206 --> 01:43:25.728]  And we're seeing it with the European Monetary Union.
[01:43:26.088 --> 01:43:34.893]  Number two, when we made the forecast, we said, we don't know what schemes undreamed of they're going to come out with.
[01:43:35.393 --> 01:43:35.974]  Here it is.
[01:43:37.062 --> 01:44:01.489]  They shuffled under the table and funneled to their friends, as you well know, over 13, between 13 to 20 trillion dollars in low-interest or no-interest loans to banks around the world, to hedge funds, to General Electric, to Harley-Davidson, to Verizon, to the Bank of Japan, the banks in South Korea,
[01:44:01.869 --> 01:44:08.653]  In Ireland, in Spain, in France, in England... They sent money to MSNBC!
[01:44:08.913 --> 01:44:11.034]  They were funding thousands of companies.
[01:44:11.334 --> 01:44:12.915]  The details are still secret.
[01:44:13.415 --> 01:44:16.217]  And the truth is, they tell us we never had a recession.
[01:44:16.577 --> 01:44:17.337]  It's all lies.
[01:44:17.417 --> 01:44:21.119]  We're in a depression for the average person.
[01:44:21.279 --> 01:44:22.880]  Every economic number is there.
[01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:26.422]  And so what you're dealing with is people that are in a delusion.
[01:44:26.742 --> 01:44:28.343]  We see Portugal going under.
[01:44:28.603 --> 01:44:29.024]  We see
[01:44:30.164 --> 01:44:53.160]  Ireland, we see Greece, Obama deception, shot two years ago, right as Obama was being sworn in, released a month after he got in, Webster Tarpley, economist George Humphrey, yourself, all of our guests in there, and my own analysis, with total precision, lay out who they work for, what they were going to do,
[01:44:54.181 --> 01:44:56.402]  What countries would go down first?
[01:44:57.343 --> 01:45:08.449]  Greece, Ireland, Portugal, then we said it would spread, and then finally into the rest of Europe and the United States, and now all over the financial news they admit it's inevitable, and then we...
[01:45:09.269 --> 01:45:14.592]  We predicted absolutely correctly, and then they spin it and say, depression?
[01:45:14.832 --> 01:45:15.453]  Recession?
[01:45:15.813 --> 01:45:16.754]  What does that mean?
[01:45:17.034 --> 01:45:18.795]  All they do is play this mind game.
[01:45:19.075 --> 01:45:20.116]  It's all hoaxes.
[01:45:20.336 --> 01:45:24.078]  Just like they say Rush Limbaugh made this guy shoot this woman.
[01:45:24.298 --> 01:45:26.440]  Turns out he doesn't even listen to Limbaugh.
[01:45:26.660 --> 01:45:29.021]  He was a liberal drug addict in love with her.
[01:45:29.361 --> 01:45:34.705]  I mean, it's hoax after hoax after hoax, but the good news is nobody's buying it.
[01:45:35.405 --> 01:45:36.345]  And here's some more.
[01:45:36.365 --> 01:45:38.866]  I mean, they never stop with this.
[01:45:39.246 --> 01:45:48.148]  Look how they're cooking the inflation numbers so people that need their cost of living increase under COLA aren't getting anything.
[01:45:48.428 --> 01:45:53.389]  They're saying that food and fuel shouldn't be into the core inflation index.
[01:45:53.749 --> 01:45:57.649]  This is perfect Soviet Union era twisting.
[01:45:57.970 --> 01:45:59.330]  Oh, and here's a good one, Alex.
[01:46:00.330 --> 01:46:06.954]  Today the stock market rebounded because the bond sales in Portugal, they were very good.
[01:46:08.095 --> 01:46:15.580]  China and Japan are pumping money into Europe to keep this Ponzi scheme afloat.
[01:46:16.100 --> 01:46:18.082]  So yes, it's collapsing.
[01:46:18.502 --> 01:46:19.783]  It will collapse.
[01:46:20.103 --> 01:46:21.544]  There's no stopping it.
[01:46:22.024 --> 01:46:24.046]  And here's the real bad news.
[01:46:24.906 --> 01:46:27.568]  It's going to be followed by war.
[01:46:28.108 --> 01:46:28.589]  Add it up.
[01:46:29.309 --> 01:46:35.136]  You hear the minister, foreign minister, economic minister of Brazil, Manteiga.
[01:46:36.169 --> 01:46:40.173]  Week after week, month after month, screaming there's a currency war.
[01:46:40.953 --> 01:46:52.864]  All of the nations are trying to intervene to keep their currencies from not increasing too much because the United States and China are devaluating theirs so they can't export.
[01:46:53.404 --> 01:46:58.869]  Then you hear from Merkel, the Chancellor of Germany, saying a trade war is beginning.
[01:46:59.490 --> 01:46:59.910]  Add them up!
[01:47:00.851 --> 01:47:05.195]  Currency wars plus trade wars equal real wars.
[01:47:05.215 --> 01:47:08.898]  Yeah, China's becoming extremely threatening, openly talking about war.
[01:47:09.218 --> 01:47:13.502]  Test firing missiles now off the coast of Texas and California.
[01:47:14.022 --> 01:47:28.335]  And what's insane about this is, as Dr. Roberts described many years ago here and countless other economists, as this starts falling apart, as the dollar plunges, the Chinese, the EU, everybody, the Arabs, they rush in to try to prop it up because they're so invested in it.
[01:47:28.795 --> 01:47:37.345]  Then the Euro starts going under, they run in pumping their currencies in there, but then that devalues their currencies, so you have a concerted devaluation.
[01:47:37.385 --> 01:47:42.511]  But how do you know the implosion's about to become accelerated and really evident, where they have trouble hiding it?
[01:47:43.051 --> 01:47:43.312]  That's...
[01:47:44.232 --> 01:47:50.074]  Once people have to pump up the dollar and the euro, they then stop buying as much of it.
[01:47:50.514 --> 01:47:55.375]  So they're still trying to prop it up because they're heavily invested from the old days, but they stop buying it.
[01:47:55.655 --> 01:47:58.816]  Now they're openly moving away from the dollar, openly moving away from the euro.
[01:47:59.036 --> 01:48:02.597]  Where are the Arabs and the Chinese and the Russians and the Brazilians investing?
[01:48:02.877 --> 01:48:06.638]  In the Chinese currency for the first time ever, it's being traded worldwide.
[01:48:06.918 --> 01:48:12.120]  The replacement of the dollar as the world reserve currency has now gone into high gear
[01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:15.122]  And everybody in New York and D.C.
[01:48:15.202 --> 01:48:20.685]  running this criminal operation, and over in England and the rest of it, they know full well what's happening.
[01:48:20.845 --> 01:48:26.768]  All the rich people I know, and people, I know some billionaires and others, I know a lot of other people that know them, they've all left the country.
[01:48:26.949 --> 01:48:30.551]  They've got armored redoubts in the middle of nowhere all over the world.
[01:48:30.591 --> 01:48:31.851]  They're scared to death!
[01:48:32.152 --> 01:48:37.455]  They know what's going on, and they're mad that we're here warning people about what they've done, Gerald!
[01:48:38.157 --> 01:48:39.998]  That's right, but look what's going on.
[01:48:40.078 --> 01:48:42.638]  Again, current events form future trends.
[01:48:43.219 --> 01:48:44.639]  First of all, with China.
[01:48:45.179 --> 01:48:55.122]  We just saw Secretary Gates over there yesterday, warning the Chinese not to underestimate the power of the American military.
[01:48:55.882 --> 01:48:57.603]  Let's save it for the kiddies.
[01:48:58.263 --> 01:49:00.545]  They're losing over in Afghanistan.
[01:49:00.965 --> 01:49:02.646]  They can't win in Iraq.
[01:49:03.266 --> 01:49:05.348]  Now they're going into Pakistan.
[01:49:05.768 --> 01:49:14.173]  And just for a little bit of history, it was the Chinese that, with the North Koreans, that brought the armistice.
[01:49:14.314 --> 01:49:16.955]  The United States and South Korea couldn't defeat them.
[01:49:17.456 --> 01:49:18.997]  Just a little bit of history.
[01:49:19.357 --> 01:49:26.682]  It was the Chinese supporting the Vietnamese that made the United States withdraw from Vietnam as losers.
[01:49:27.322 --> 01:49:40.657]  And now they're going to say that the Chinese are underestimating our military strength as they show off, by no mistake, their new stealth fighter jets.
[01:49:41.437 --> 01:49:49.126]  They now have their new weaponry, these missiles that can take out aircraft carriers and fleets of ships.
[01:49:49.446 --> 01:49:52.748]  Our trains can't even go above 50, the rail lines are so old.
[01:49:53.028 --> 01:49:58.570]  China isn't just building 250 mile an hour train lines over there, they're now building them in the US!
[01:49:58.830 --> 01:49:59.931]  They own everything!
[01:50:00.411 --> 01:50:02.932]  Yeah, they're bidding in California.
[01:50:03.292 --> 01:50:08.054]  They're bidding in California, and now they're in the process of buying up Europe.
[01:50:08.375 --> 01:50:10.956]  What do you think they're bailing out the banks for?
[01:50:11.576 --> 01:50:15.499]  They're taking over the industries, one after another.
[01:50:15.819 --> 01:50:17.260]  It's the golden rule.
[01:50:17.740 --> 01:50:19.701]  Those who have the gold rule.
[01:50:19.761 --> 01:50:22.583]  The banks completely sold us out through pure treachery.
[01:50:22.603 --> 01:50:27.046]  And you notice the CFR a decade ago said, the next century will be the Chinese century.
[01:50:27.366 --> 01:50:28.907]  They geared this whole thing up.
[01:50:29.208 --> 01:50:31.409]  Maury Strong and all of them have moved to China.
[01:50:31.609 --> 01:50:32.530]  They set us up.
[01:50:32.730 --> 01:50:33.831]  They sucked us dry.
[01:50:34.011 --> 01:50:35.412]  They blew us away, Gerald.
[01:50:36.152 --> 01:50:41.896]  And look who the guy is, as you just mentioned, the Daley family, who just moved in.
[01:50:42.216 --> 01:50:47.620]  You know what he was known for under the Clinton administration, when he was Commerce Secretary?
[01:50:47.640 --> 01:50:51.682]  He was known as the NAFTA czar!
[01:50:52.303 --> 01:50:56.125]  He's the guy that was the brains behind pushing it through!
[01:50:56.205 --> 01:50:57.126]  Incredible, stay there!
[01:50:58.407 --> 01:50:59.668]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:50:59.708 --> 01:51:05.050]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:05.291 --> 01:51:09.913]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:10.313 --> 01:51:10.713]  It's true.
[01:51:10.793 --> 01:51:15.336]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:15.876 --> 01:51:20.581]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.

[01:54:01.176 --> 01:54:06.360]  Gerald Cilentilli with us, five minutes to the next hour.
[01:54:06.460 --> 01:54:13.506]  Then I'm going to have open phones and go over just masses of vital news and information.
[01:54:13.546 --> 01:54:15.207]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:54:15.227 --> 01:54:15.267]  800-259-9231.
[01:54:15.287 --> 01:54:18.070]  You know, Gerald, I love this modern media spin that we're being negative,
[01:54:28.058 --> 01:54:51.221]  We're hurting confidence with our, as the New York Times called you, a purveyor of pessimism porn, and they've called me a purveyor of conspiracy porn all over the news, Newsweek, Time Magazine and others, when all we're doing is reporting on the spectacle of foreign banks stealing tens of trillions
[01:54:52.421 --> 01:55:09.325]  Uh, NAFTA and GATT destroying our industrial base, China buying up the ports, the roads, taxes exploding, and then we're here saying, hey, this is a bad idea, and the government's answer is, shut up, don't upset people, we need to take your free speech away.
[01:55:09.645 --> 01:55:12.426]  I mean, if that's not bona fide tyranny, what is?
[01:55:13.254 --> 01:55:17.076]  Well, it's again Harvard, Princeton, Yale, bullets, bombs, and banks.
[01:55:17.796 --> 01:55:21.398]  And as I've said many times, think of the word confidence.
[01:55:21.758 --> 01:55:23.519]  We're hurting the confidence.
[01:55:24.040 --> 01:55:25.160]  It's a con game.
[01:55:25.320 --> 01:55:26.061]  Confidence.
[01:55:26.181 --> 01:55:26.921]  Con men.
[01:55:27.201 --> 01:55:28.062]  That's all they are.
[01:55:28.502 --> 01:55:34.087]  And again, when I came out and said, listen, this real estate market is not going to correct itself.
[01:55:34.468 --> 01:55:36.490]  They're taking our money to pump it up.
[01:55:37.030 --> 01:55:38.672]  Oh, you're a gloom and doomer.
[01:55:38.932 --> 01:55:40.173]  You're hurting confidence.
[01:55:40.233 --> 01:55:42.395]  No, we're stopping the con game.
[01:55:42.715 --> 01:55:43.696]  And they don't like it.
[01:55:44.097 --> 01:55:45.738]  You want to hear one for the books?
[01:55:46.579 --> 01:55:50.802]  Remember Judith Miller with the New York Times, the toilet paper of record?
[01:55:51.283 --> 01:56:03.952]  She was the one that pushed off the propaganda sent to her from the Bush administration, the Cheney neocons, that Saddam Hussein was acquiring materials to build nuclear weaponry.
[01:56:04.833 --> 01:56:10.515]  She came out recently and said that WikiLeaks is bad journalism.
[01:56:10.815 --> 01:56:13.616]  Could you imagine this coming from her mouth?
[01:56:14.056 --> 01:56:21.398]  They can't stand us, Alex, because we're exposing the game and we don't suck up and bow down.
[01:56:21.938 --> 01:56:22.578]  It's incredible.
[01:56:22.618 --> 01:56:27.760]  She also came out and called for civility in media, but her lies and her
[01:56:28.340 --> 01:56:36.106]  Her publishing of those government lies, knowingly, helped cause all our dead troops, and all those dead people overseas, and the goodwill of the U.S.
[01:56:36.126 --> 01:56:38.608]  that's in so much trouble, and these failed wars.
[01:56:38.888 --> 01:56:41.370]  You know, it's fine when they lie about WMDs.
[01:56:41.751 --> 01:56:48.936]  It's fine when, you know, government does things like that to kill people, because they're not going to show us all the dead Iraqi kids on the news.
[01:56:49.237 --> 01:56:53.200]  They're just going to try to use this dead nine-year-old to take our liberties domestically.
[01:56:53.460 --> 01:56:54.421]  They know what they're doing.
[01:56:54.981 --> 01:57:02.964]  Oh yeah, you look at the front page coverage whenever it's a Veterans Day or whatever in the New York Times.
[01:57:03.024 --> 01:57:04.304]  It's pure propaganda.
[01:57:04.684 --> 01:57:08.365]  Oh, and I was mentioning before about current events forming future trends.
[01:57:08.745 --> 01:57:09.766]  I mentioned China.
[01:57:10.606 --> 01:57:12.006]  Two things before I go on.
[01:57:12.567 --> 01:57:21.970]  One is that as the American media is so focused on this Arizona tragedy, as a trend tracking tip, watch the rest of the news going on around the world.
[01:57:22.330 --> 01:57:25.851]  Because there are big things happening that are going to change the direction of things.
[01:57:26.471 --> 01:57:28.852]  One of them being what's going on in Tunisia.
[01:57:29.492 --> 01:57:31.613]  It's going on and it happened in England.
[01:57:31.913 --> 01:57:33.594]  It went happening in Italy.
[01:57:33.614 --> 01:57:39.756]  The youth of the world are uniting against what's going on.
[01:57:39.796 --> 01:57:46.279]  The students of the world, they're angry and they're mad as hell and they're not taking it anymore.
[01:57:46.619 --> 01:57:48.520]  They're rioting in the streets.
[01:57:48.540 --> 01:57:50.520]  You predicted this two and a half years ago on air.
[01:57:50.560 --> 01:57:56.243]  You said that the education bubble would pop worldwide because there are no jobs for these degrees.
[01:57:57.083 --> 01:57:57.863]  Exactly.
[01:57:58.203 --> 01:58:04.725]  And they know that levels of corruption, what they call austerity measures, you were talking about before.
[01:58:05.185 --> 01:58:15.188]  Raising taxes, lowering the minimum wage, losing jobs, losing pensions, losing benefits, add it up.
[01:58:15.948 --> 01:58:24.750]  Students in the streets in France, in Italy, in Greece, in England, in Tunisia, in Turkey!
[01:58:25.350 --> 01:58:27.771]  It's happening in front of our eyes.
[01:58:28.251 --> 01:58:30.151]  Why did it happen in the U.S.

[01:59:53.573 --> 01:59:56.374]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:02.918 --> 02:00:07.100]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:07.740 --> 02:00:08.540]  You want answers?
[02:00:09.320 --> 02:00:10.241]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:10.881 --> 02:00:14.522]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:15.062 --> 02:00:19.144]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:20.359 --> 02:00:24.240]  All right, I'm going to blitzkrieg through stacks of vital news in the next segment.
[02:00:24.940 --> 02:00:29.521]  After Gerald Cilente leaves us in about five minutes, and then I'm going to take calls for the balance of the broadcast.
[02:00:29.621 --> 02:00:32.662]  Hefford with some other important news coming up.
[02:00:33.242 --> 02:00:40.624]  But I want to hear from you, 800-259-9231, and we'll get you up and on the air today.
[02:00:41.604 --> 02:00:46.325]  Gerald, you were making a point again when the break cut you off.
[02:00:46.345 --> 02:00:46.685]  Go ahead.
[02:00:47.847 --> 02:00:57.516]  Well, go back to the 1960s, and I was there, and I'm 64 years old, so I was prime draft meat in those days.
[02:00:58.097 --> 02:00:59.898]  Why were the students out in the streets?
[02:00:59.958 --> 02:01:00.919]  It was very simple.
[02:01:01.280 --> 02:01:04.302]  They were getting drafted, and they didn't want to go to Vietnam.
[02:01:05.103 --> 02:01:09.405]  Why isn't anybody protesting these Afghan and Iraq wars?
[02:01:09.445 --> 02:01:15.687]  And by the way, in this midterm elections, not a peep about cutting the military budget or ending the wars.
[02:01:16.227 --> 02:01:17.548]  Why aren't they there?
[02:01:17.608 --> 02:01:19.908]  Because their necks aren't on the line.
[02:01:20.389 --> 02:01:22.429]  Why are they protesting in Europe?
[02:01:22.830 --> 02:01:26.131]  Because their necks are on the line in a different way.
[02:01:26.451 --> 02:01:28.392]  They have a futureless future.
[02:01:28.792 --> 02:01:29.792]  They're in debt.
[02:01:30.172 --> 02:01:31.893]  They have no money coming in.
[02:01:32.293 --> 02:01:35.114]  The same thing is going to start to happen in the U.S.
[02:01:35.514 --> 02:01:56.084]  Because these kids are facing mountains of debt, they have these university degrees in worthlessness, they're stuck home living with mommy and daddy, they're smart enough to know, it's just like the days of, it's neo-feudalism, now we have the kings and queens of commerce that are robbing us blind.
[02:01:56.744 --> 02:02:03.672]  But the difference is, back in the feudal days, they didn't have the kind of information that you're putting out there.
[02:02:03.993 --> 02:02:06.316]  They didn't have information from the Trends Journal.
[02:02:06.596 --> 02:02:08.779]  They didn't have all of this knowledge.
[02:02:09.119 --> 02:02:12.203]  They see what's going on, and they're angry.
[02:02:12.603 --> 02:02:17.648]  So the revolution is going to happen from the students!
[02:02:18.088 --> 02:02:29.199]  Because let's face it, when you're 18 to 30 years old, 28 years old, you know, you have these hormones raging through your body, you don't know any limits, and you're angry!
[02:02:29.980 --> 02:02:34.022]  You think they're going to be taking to the streets in protest?
[02:02:34.362 --> 02:02:37.623]  They have nothing to lose by doing it.
[02:02:37.963 --> 02:02:41.444]  They have everything to lose by not doing it.
[02:02:41.784 --> 02:02:44.145]  And I want to add one more point into it.
[02:02:44.646 --> 02:02:47.787]  As we're looking at these phony employment numbers,
[02:02:48.607 --> 02:02:58.051]  They're not accounting for all the young people that haven't gotten into the employment sector because they can't find any jobs.
[02:02:58.372 --> 02:03:07.356]  When you add that number in, you're looking at another three to four million that have never been put into the system.
[02:03:08.632 --> 02:03:10.493]  Well, it's a recipe for disaster.
[02:03:10.513 --> 02:03:19.718]  And then you've got so many other people who their parents cook the dinner for them, never make them wash the plates, never make them do laundry, never make them do any work.
[02:03:20.118 --> 02:03:21.559]  And then they get into the workforce.
[02:03:21.759 --> 02:03:24.820]  I mean, it's not only that, you know, are the globalists cheating us.
[02:03:25.121 --> 02:03:27.122]  There's a lot of lazy, entitled people
[02:03:28.042 --> 02:03:38.745]  in this country, and now as reality dawns on them, government hopes to organize them into some type of political mob to, you know, be the jackboots to rob those of us that do work.
[02:03:39.165 --> 02:03:40.645]  But I just don't see that happening.
[02:03:40.805 --> 02:03:48.007]  I mean, an army of entitled slobs, you know, does not make an effective Gestapo.
[02:03:48.982 --> 02:03:54.047]  No, but you might find them at the TSA, you know.
[02:03:54.587 --> 02:03:55.268]  No, you're right.
[02:03:55.348 --> 02:03:57.450]  No, they won't be able to stop it.
[02:03:57.510 --> 02:03:58.431]  It's happening.
[02:03:58.891 --> 02:03:59.852]  It's happening.
[02:04:00.293 --> 02:04:02.495]  Again, only look at the news.
[02:04:02.755 --> 02:04:06.819]  And that's what I'm saying, and I want to make that point again as a trend forecaster.
[02:04:07.139 --> 02:04:10.322]  We're looking at the other news going on around the world.
[02:04:10.402 --> 02:04:15.446]  Again, Turkey, Tunisia, Greece, Italy, England, France.
[02:04:15.866 --> 02:04:17.908]  The students are up in arms.
[02:04:18.168 --> 02:04:21.171]  The tuition rates increased 200% in the UK.
[02:04:24.093 --> 02:04:25.954]  As they're cutting back on everything.
[02:04:25.974 --> 02:04:29.617]  Oh, and by the way, we're gonna raise the value-added taxes.
[02:04:30.017 --> 02:04:32.899]  Oh, and your property taxes, they're gonna go up too.
[02:04:33.199 --> 02:04:38.883]  We're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna squeeze every nickel and dime out of you.
[02:04:39.243 --> 02:04:49.450]  All of a sudden, Alex, these dim-witted bureaucrats who never come up with a bright idea, they know that they have to have the money coming in so they can keep their jobs.
[02:04:49.530 --> 02:04:50.631]  And now they want to cow us.
[02:04:51.551 --> 02:04:52.833]  To not have political free speech.
[02:04:52.873 --> 02:04:55.296]  Gerald Cilente, thank you for joining us so much.
[02:04:55.396 --> 02:04:55.957]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:58.114 --> 02:05:02.357]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:05:02.678 --> 02:05:03.278]  Number one.
[02:05:03.598 --> 02:05:06.741]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:07.021 --> 02:05:07.581]  Number two.
[02:05:07.882 --> 02:05:12.425]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:05:12.765 --> 02:05:13.206]  It's true.
[02:05:13.506 --> 02:05:18.069]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:18.390 --> 02:05:18.930]  Number three.
[02:05:19.210 --> 02:05:22.493]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:05:22.793 --> 02:05:26.496]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:05:26.696 --> 02:05:27.237]  Number 4.
[02:05:27.477 --> 02:05:29.859]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:05:30.259 --> 02:05:33.642]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:05:33.922 --> 02:05:34.143]  Number 5.
[02:05:34.723 --> 02:05:38.646]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:05:38.867 --> 02:05:43.631]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:05:43.911 --> 02:05:47.936]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:05:48.076 --> 02:05:49.658]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:05:49.878 --> 02:05:51.961]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:05:52.121 --> 02:05:54.464]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:05:59.170 --> 02:06:02.812]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:06:03.192 --> 02:06:06.193]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:06:06.433 --> 02:06:11.215]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:06:11.235 --> 02:06:17.478]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:06:17.618 --> 02:06:19.859]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:06:20.299 --> 02:06:20.579]  Tim Geithner?
[02:06:20.599 --> 02:06:20.779]  Bernanke?
[02:06:20.799 --> 02:06:21.219]  They're arsonists!
[02:06:21.239 --> 02:06:21.859]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:06:21.879 --> 02:06:23.620]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:06:39.304 --> 02:06:43.226]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[02:06:43.687 --> 02:06:46.228]  we have seen a fall of the republic.
[02:06:46.588 --> 02:06:55.693]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:06:59.602 --> 02:07:03.243]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:03.563 --> 02:07:11.685]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:07:12.426 --> 02:07:16.467]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:07:17.047 --> 02:07:27.870]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:07:28.510 --> 02:07:37.518]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:38.018 --> 02:07:43.102]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:07:43.462 --> 02:07:50.628]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:50.949 --> 02:07:53.691]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[02:07:59.232 --> 02:08:01.453]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:02.013 --> 02:08:04.874]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:13.278 --> 02:08:19.120]  Law in Colorado.
[02:08:20.180 --> 02:08:26.603]  Patrick, Jeremy, Heather, Bob, your calls are all coming up in the next segment.
[02:08:29.124 --> 02:08:44.870]  I wonder if that's the law, like a six-foot-eight guy with a build like an NFL linebacker, who whenever MSNBC attacked my bullhorn when I was bullhorning Chris Matthews, they cut it with a knife.
[02:08:45.610 --> 02:08:48.491]  We called law up, who was in the nearby area with another bullhorn.
[02:08:48.511 --> 02:08:49.071]  He pulled up.
[02:08:49.111 --> 02:08:52.673]  We put Luke Radowski up on his shoulders away from their knives.
[02:08:53.533 --> 02:08:55.354]  That's actually the extra.
[02:08:55.974 --> 02:08:57.514]  On my film, The Obama Deception.
[02:08:57.534 --> 02:09:02.436]  I wonder if that's the law from Colorado or somebody else known as the law.
[02:09:02.896 --> 02:09:05.616]  We'll see coming up in the next segment with calls.
[02:09:05.636 --> 02:09:09.157]  We don't screen your calls, so I don't know if that's law or not.
[02:09:09.177 --> 02:09:14.919]  But you can again see him in the extra of The Obama Deception or Alex Jones, Bullhorns, Chris Matthews.
[02:09:14.959 --> 02:09:17.980]  And you can see it in that video as well.
[02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:21.701]  They got so mad when I was bullhorning their live broadcast because they were outside.
[02:09:21.721 --> 02:09:22.301]  It's free speech.
[02:09:23.921 --> 02:09:28.905]  They attack me, they hit me, they punch me, and they cut the wire, try to pull the bullhorn away.
[02:09:28.925 --> 02:09:32.728]  I call Luke and Law up, they pull up, they got two more bullhorns.
[02:09:32.789 --> 02:09:33.529]  I start bullhorning.
[02:09:34.490 --> 02:09:40.074]  Luke climbs up, and he's not a little guy, up on Law's shoulders, and that was some classic.
[02:09:40.375 --> 02:09:43.277]  And I said, go ahead and break these bullhorns, we'll bring four back!
[02:09:44.958 --> 02:09:46.299]  See, that's the fighting spirit.
[02:09:47.260 --> 02:09:50.263]  Okay, let's get into the serious news here.
[02:09:52.179 --> 02:09:56.601]  Years ago, I interviewed these people, and they will not come on the show now.
[02:09:58.362 --> 02:10:06.826]  And whereas they do get their First Amendment, people do deserve privacy at their events on private property.
[02:10:09.307 --> 02:10:12.669]  And I have no doubt watching these people and researching them.
[02:10:13.209 --> 02:10:20.192]  I believe, it's my opinion, that they're being financed by the government to create a pretext to shut down free speech.
[02:10:20.212 --> 02:10:20.973]  There's no way
[02:10:22.539 --> 02:10:23.640]  And I've watched them on television.
[02:10:23.660 --> 02:10:24.260]  They giggle.
[02:10:24.320 --> 02:10:24.880]  They snicker.
[02:10:24.920 --> 02:10:25.761]  They act demonic.
[02:10:26.361 --> 02:10:27.522]  They act very, very demonic.
[02:10:27.542 --> 02:10:29.123]  And I challenge them to come on this show.
[02:10:30.383 --> 02:10:31.544]  They're very, very demonic.
[02:10:33.105 --> 02:10:38.227]  And just my sixth sense, when I look at them, I think these are demonic people.
[02:10:38.407 --> 02:10:41.469]  These are goblin-like, giggling, snickering creatures.
[02:10:41.489 --> 02:10:46.992]  I mean, if you were going to go to a funeral and say, America's been judged while we have dead troops, that would be bad enough.
[02:10:47.132 --> 02:10:49.353]  But it's your First Amendment, and I'll defend that right.
[02:10:50.714 --> 02:10:53.755]  But to then giggle and snicker and enjoy it.
[02:10:53.775 --> 02:10:56.477]  I mean, it's filthy.
[02:10:57.637 --> 02:11:06.262]  And now the Westboro Baptist Church to face angel wings bikers and legislation at nine-year-old Tucson funeral.
[02:11:08.202 --> 02:11:15.206]  I wonder how these people would like it if folks were bullhorning their house every day.
[02:11:17.014 --> 02:11:18.195]  I wonder how they would like it.
[02:11:19.436 --> 02:11:21.617]  Again, these are extreme tests of the First Amendment.
[02:11:22.137 --> 02:11:25.540]  It's done either out of complete craziness, or I believe it's staged.
[02:11:26.480 --> 02:11:28.622]  And again, it's comments like this.
[02:11:30.042 --> 02:11:31.183]  And I've seen it on video.
[02:11:31.243 --> 02:11:32.944]  I don't just trust the news when I see stuff.
[02:11:33.024 --> 02:11:35.046]  I've seen similar quotes by this guy.
[02:11:35.346 --> 02:11:41.750]  Speaking in a video about the shooting in Arizona, Westboro leader Fred Phelps said, thank God for the violent shooter.
[02:11:43.031 --> 02:11:44.492]  A guy in a Grim Reaper outfit?
[02:11:45.698 --> 02:11:51.923]  You know, a guy who is on psychotropic hallucinogens, I mean, this is sick.
[02:11:52.283 --> 02:12:05.413]  That little nine-year-old girl, I'm telling you right now, I believe in the First Amendment, but we had a First Amendment back in the old days when if you said to somebody, your wife is a whore,
[02:12:06.816 --> 02:12:18.324]  Uh, if the person thought it wasn't true and had honor, they would punch you in the face, basically slap you, and say, I will meet you in one hour at this public park, and you better come, uh, with your musket.
[02:12:19.024 --> 02:12:26.489]  Or you, or you can pick a, you can pick a handgun or you can pick a, uh, you can pick a sword.
[02:12:28.424 --> 02:12:33.967]  And the tail end of that is the archetypal 1860s, 70s, you know, guys in a bar and they say, let's go out and settle this.
[02:12:33.987 --> 02:12:36.448]  And then they pace 20 paces off and then draw.
[02:12:37.268 --> 02:12:38.589]  Then they made that stuff illegal.
[02:12:38.609 --> 02:12:45.573]  You know, in the old days, I mean, even when I was a teenager, most of the time, cops pull up and there's a fight going on.
[02:12:45.613 --> 02:12:48.434]  If people aren't stabbing each other and stuff, they just break it up.
[02:12:48.514 --> 02:12:50.795]  Nowadays, they send you to jail for that.
[02:12:51.796 --> 02:12:55.698]  But I, I got to tell you, sitting there saying, thank God for this little girl getting shot.
[02:12:57.824 --> 02:12:59.925]  And they've got an obsession with homosexuality.
[02:13:00.525 --> 02:13:08.149]  You know, I can see America being judged for abortion, but it's just this watching weirdos get all giggly-faced and all excited and lick their lips.
[02:13:08.229 --> 02:13:13.651]  I mean, they just look like every other demon-possessed person I've seen, basically.
[02:13:13.671 --> 02:13:16.972]  They've got that, you know, in my gut, my spirit, these are bad people.
[02:13:17.513 --> 02:13:22.115]  These are bad, bad, bad, bad, bad people.
[02:13:22.355 --> 02:13:24.836]  And it's my First Amendment to say it about them.
[02:13:25.782 --> 02:13:26.522]  Make me sick!
[02:13:27.543 --> 02:13:37.329]  And their whole cause isn't about teaching people that a lifestyle is unhealthy or that it's destructive or robs you of the joy of children.
[02:13:37.589 --> 02:13:39.410]  It's not a loving message to these people.
[02:13:40.111 --> 02:13:52.078]  It is a message that will only make all of those people's lifestyles seem that much better and good compared to you saying how great it is that a nine-year-old is dead.
[02:13:53.820 --> 02:14:00.164]  You make me want to throw up, and I would never go to any of these demonstrations to cover this, because I don't think I could control myself.
[02:14:02.346 --> 02:14:05.348]  And it's one thing to go out and protest dead troops, that's bad enough.
[02:14:05.948 --> 02:14:15.195]  But when you start getting all happy, and giggling, and smirking, and hopping up and down like a demon... Alright, I'm gonna be quiet, I'm gonna stop right there, before I start saying more stuff.
[02:14:21.055 --> 02:14:22.796]  I'll tell you something about this family.
[02:14:23.196 --> 02:14:24.676]  I think they protest too much.
[02:14:25.737 --> 02:14:29.058]  Looking at them, I'm not even going to get into it.
[02:14:29.078 --> 02:14:30.539]  These people make me want to throw up.
[02:14:36.601 --> 02:14:42.283]  Speaking in a video about the shooting in Arizona, the pastor said, thank God for the violent shooter.
[02:14:46.519 --> 02:14:56.828]  And you've got a big Democrat writer, we covered it yesterday, saying that since his family doesn't want to use their daughter's death to get guns or free speech, that they should have their child taken from them.
[02:14:59.950 --> 02:15:01.011]  But that's their free speech!
[02:15:01.071 --> 02:15:08.858]  But you're not gonna take my free speech away to say you're scum, you're trash, you're filth.
[02:15:11.345 --> 02:15:18.607]  That freakazoid Westboro Church is, and that freakazoid syndicated columnist is saying take their kid.
[02:15:19.968 --> 02:15:23.749]  That's why we've got the Republic, is to protect ourselves from freaks like you.
[02:15:23.989 --> 02:15:30.892]  Because in a democracy, they could get 51% of the gibbering public to go along with them and actually take our rights away.
[02:15:30.912 --> 02:15:35.053]  Alright, I'll try to not talk about the Westboro Church, but...
[02:15:41.343 --> 02:15:43.165]  They're there to give Christians a bad name.
[02:15:43.545 --> 02:15:46.148]  They're there to give family values groups a bad name.
[02:15:46.388 --> 02:15:48.050]  They're there to destroy the First Amendment.
[02:15:49.511 --> 02:15:53.295]  And if the government didn't pull on the strings, the old devil is.
[02:15:53.315 --> 02:15:56.718]  I mean, just look... I ought to show some video of them.
[02:15:56.758 --> 02:16:02.024]  I mean, these are... All right, I'm going to shut up.
[02:16:02.724 --> 02:16:04.967]  What's happening, I kind of got stuck in a little eddy pool here.
[02:16:06.954 --> 02:16:11.395]  You know, kind of a back-to-the-future Groundhog Day, because I just keep imaging videos.
[02:16:11.435 --> 02:16:20.798]  I've seen these people over the years, and how they enjoy when the families are crying over their dead sons or daughters in the war, or now this family with their dead little girl.
[02:16:21.578 --> 02:16:28.620]  And I've seen where they, like demons, suck up the pain, the enjoyment, and get all these little Nelly-looking looks on their faces.
[02:16:28.680 --> 02:16:29.720]  It makes me want to throw up.
[02:16:33.077 --> 02:16:38.658]  You know, just the gibbering, nellying, in the pain is really bad.
[02:16:38.678 --> 02:16:39.698]  Alright, I'm done.
[02:16:39.819 --> 02:16:40.259]  I'm done!
[02:16:40.279 --> 02:16:42.339]  I'm done talking about them.
[02:16:44.660 --> 02:16:48.140]  And then to watch all this trash using people like them to go after our First Amendment.
[02:16:48.580 --> 02:16:51.521]  Okay, continuing here with this information.
[02:16:52.741 --> 02:16:55.682]  Here's another really great piece of evil out of LifeNews.com.
[02:16:55.722 --> 02:17:00.923]  You know, I live in the only county in Texas, and that's why I've now officially moved out of the county.
[02:17:02.836 --> 02:17:04.537]  So I don't have to pay money for it.
[02:17:07.297 --> 02:17:08.898]  You've got to make a stand at some point.
[02:17:09.998 --> 02:17:16.560]  They conduct thousands of abortions a year and they take my money in Travis County, Texas, the only county in Texas to do it.
[02:17:17.640 --> 02:17:21.061]  Many other states and statewide to pay for even partial birth abortion.
[02:17:21.521 --> 02:17:25.363]  There's people lined up around the block to adopt that baby, but they kill them.
[02:17:26.623 --> 02:17:30.004]  But Vanderbilt University requires nursing students to do abortions.
[02:17:31.186 --> 02:17:31.686]  That's right.
[02:17:31.906 --> 02:17:33.147]  You want to get your nursing degree?
[02:17:33.928 --> 02:17:37.230]  Well, you got to help kill children.
[02:17:38.290 --> 02:17:39.271]  You got to pay for it.
[02:17:39.351 --> 02:17:40.532]  You got to help kill them.
[02:17:41.392 --> 02:17:43.233]  They want you to be part of their evil.
[02:17:44.874 --> 02:17:46.135]  That's the problem with the world government.
[02:17:46.195 --> 02:17:48.957]  If this goes nationwide, they want to make me pay for abortions.
[02:17:49.137 --> 02:17:50.458]  That's what national health care does.
[02:17:50.978 --> 02:17:52.619]  I'm almost forced to leave the country.
[02:17:53.019 --> 02:17:54.320]  But where is there to go?
[02:17:54.700 --> 02:17:55.981]  They're doing this worldwide.
[02:17:56.081 --> 02:17:56.862]  I'm sick of it.
[02:17:58.390 --> 02:18:02.373]  They're all freaking out over this nine-year-old dead girl, but she achieved consciousness.
[02:18:02.733 --> 02:18:05.435]  She achieved a great nine years and a loving family.
[02:18:05.715 --> 02:18:08.257]  She didn't get cut up before she ever left the womb.
[02:18:09.838 --> 02:18:11.178]  She got... Oh, man.
[02:18:13.020 --> 02:18:21.825]  Vanderbilt University is the subject of a federal complaint filed today by officials with the Alliance Defense Fund over requiring nursing students to participate in abortions.
[02:18:23.867 --> 02:18:25.328]  Absolutely, that is so immoral.
[02:18:27.024 --> 02:18:30.808]  And of course, the liberal groups all support nurses saying no to circumcision.
[02:18:31.248 --> 02:18:31.829]  Which is fine.
[02:18:31.849 --> 02:18:33.471]  You think that's immoral, sexual mutilation?
[02:18:33.871 --> 02:18:34.632]  That's fine.
[02:18:34.892 --> 02:18:36.073]  You shouldn't have to participate in it.
[02:18:36.594 --> 02:18:38.656]  People go, well it's your job, participate!
[02:18:39.497 --> 02:18:39.797]  Really?
[02:18:40.978 --> 02:18:46.403]  Some folks come in and want you to sexually mutilate their daughter because they're from a country that does that?
[02:18:46.443 --> 02:18:47.304]  Should a nurse have to do it?
[02:18:48.445 --> 02:18:50.087]  But what about chopping a baby up?
[02:18:53.319 --> 02:18:53.940]  What about that?
[02:18:54.680 --> 02:18:55.541]  Gonna have to be part of that?
[02:18:55.561 --> 02:18:57.383]  Gonna have to see its little arms and legs and head?
[02:18:57.403 --> 02:18:59.745]  And every time I talk like this, some people freak out.
[02:18:59.965 --> 02:19:00.165]  What?
[02:19:00.245 --> 02:19:01.086]  It's going on!
[02:19:01.366 --> 02:19:03.088]  Don't you want to know what's going on?
[02:19:03.468 --> 02:19:05.310]  Don't you want to understand what's going on?
[02:19:05.330 --> 02:19:08.272]  And by the way, it's working.
[02:19:08.773 --> 02:19:10.554]  Abortion is down overall.
[02:19:11.675 --> 02:19:15.679]  In the polls, the vast majority are now against it, when the majority was for it.
[02:19:16.900 --> 02:19:18.261]  Just by hair, back in the 1970s.
[02:19:20.404 --> 02:19:23.825]  People are more pro-gun than they ever were in the face of the propaganda.
[02:19:24.005 --> 02:19:25.406]  They're more anti-abortion.
[02:19:25.606 --> 02:19:27.066]  They're anti-federal reserve.
[02:19:27.766 --> 02:19:28.426]  Do you get it?
[02:19:28.527 --> 02:19:30.607]  The awakening is happening.
[02:19:31.507 --> 02:19:39.430]  And so they want to have their goons run around and protest funerals so that laws get passed shutting down free speech.
[02:19:42.438 --> 02:19:48.064]  And it goes on with a fourth-year nursing student where they're trying to force be part of killing the baby.
[02:19:48.345 --> 02:19:51.128]  You know how traumatizing it is to see little arms and legs?
[02:19:51.508 --> 02:19:52.629]  I mean, a lot of you don't want to hear it.
[02:19:52.890 --> 02:19:54.472]  Especially you abortion supporters.
[02:19:54.912 --> 02:19:58.116]  You don't want to be forced to look at the dead concentration camp victim.
[02:19:58.736 --> 02:20:03.621]  If you own a septic system or if you're facing costly septic system replacement, this message is for you.

[02:21:06.402 --> 02:21:11.184]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:21:11.204 --> 02:21:17.446]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:21:17.586 --> 02:21:19.827]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:21:20.387 --> 02:21:20.647]  Tim Geithner?
[02:21:20.687 --> 02:21:21.108]  Bernanke?
[02:21:21.208 --> 02:21:21.828]  They're arsonists!
[02:21:21.868 --> 02:21:23.130]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:21:23.150 --> 02:21:25.392]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:21:39.284 --> 02:21:46.231]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.

[02:21:57.503 --> 02:21:58.764]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:21:58.804 --> 02:22:04.146]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:22:04.387 --> 02:22:09.009]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:22:09.409 --> 02:22:14.452]  It's true, seeds had outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:22:14.972 --> 02:22:19.675]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:22:20.196 --> 02:22:22.137]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[02:22:22.517 --> 02:22:27.120]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:22:27.320 --> 02:22:28.221]  And here's the best part.

[02:22:49.336 --> 02:22:53.840]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.

[02:23:36.033 --> 02:23:36.774]  This capitalism?
[02:23:36.834 --> 02:23:42.958]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:23:43.098 --> 02:23:43.919]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[02:23:43.979 --> 02:23:47.061]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.

[02:23:49.442 --> 02:23:49.722]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:23:49.762 --> 02:23:50.043]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:24:01.288 --> 02:24:08.350]  Well, the Westboro Demons' new development, they have cancelled protesting the nine-year-old dead girl.
[02:24:08.410 --> 02:24:13.851]  They're moving on to Judge Roll, who was ruled against Bill Clinton's gun-grabbing.
[02:24:13.871 --> 02:24:19.953]  So they're going to go on and celebrate his death so they can demonize the First Amendment.
[02:24:21.553 --> 02:24:24.574]  I was trying to get them on last year and Jaron talked about it.
[02:24:24.594 --> 02:24:27.436]  They would send back emails that were like unintelligible gibberish.
[02:24:27.816 --> 02:24:29.136]  Maybe they're just completely crazy.
[02:24:29.977 --> 02:24:31.818]  I don't know what they are, but I'm done talking about them.
[02:24:32.438 --> 02:24:34.119]  And I want to get back into the shooting.
[02:24:34.139 --> 02:24:36.100]  I want to get back into the economy.
[02:24:38.021 --> 02:24:39.962]  I've got a bunch of news I want to get into.
[02:24:40.823 --> 02:24:54.312]  Of course, it's coming out that he was, quote, shooting at the world, hated everyone, liberals, conservatives, didn't like anybody, and didn't watch TV, didn't listen to talk radio, but was obsessed with the Congresswoman.
[02:24:55.653 --> 02:25:01.677]  As we wrote, he was sweet on her, and he felt rejected by women, and so he went down there to kill her.
[02:25:03.410 --> 02:25:04.090]  And there you go.
[02:25:04.771 --> 02:25:07.012]  Will you hear apologies from the Sheriff?
[02:25:08.232 --> 02:25:08.732]  Dupnick?
[02:25:08.792 --> 02:25:10.353]  Will you hear apologies from Bill Clinton?
[02:25:11.033 --> 02:25:12.634]  Will you hear apologies from any of them?
[02:25:12.674 --> 02:25:12.894]  No.
[02:25:13.014 --> 02:25:14.054]  They knew full well.
[02:25:14.335 --> 02:25:16.716]  They're attacking the First Amendment and the Second Amendment.
[02:25:17.036 --> 02:25:19.377]  They're attacking what makes America, America.
[02:25:19.777 --> 02:25:23.458]  And they're going to continue to do it with every tragedy they can out of 310 million Americans.
[02:25:25.279 --> 02:25:27.020]  They're gonna milk it every time.
[02:25:27.781 --> 02:25:28.961]  Every time they can!
[02:25:29.602 --> 02:25:30.563]  Because they're tyrants!
[02:25:30.803 --> 02:25:31.463]  They're crooks!
[02:25:31.723 --> 02:25:33.084]  They're stealing us blind!
[02:25:33.825 --> 02:25:35.126]  They know what they're doing!
[02:25:35.366 --> 02:25:36.627]  They want to cow you!
[02:25:37.027 --> 02:25:40.389]  But the good news is, we're not sitting down and shutting up anymore.
[02:25:40.809 --> 02:25:42.050]  Law in Colorado.
[02:25:42.330 --> 02:25:43.311]  You're on the air, Law.
[02:25:44.272 --> 02:25:45.252]  Hello, Alex, man.
[02:25:45.292 --> 02:25:46.233]  Great to talk to you again.
[02:25:46.473 --> 02:25:47.654]  Hey, I recognize your voice.
[02:25:47.674 --> 02:25:50.235]  You're the guy that was protesting with us in Denver, right?
[02:25:51.216 --> 02:25:51.937]  I'm that guy.
[02:25:53.137 --> 02:25:53.818]  How you doing, man?
[02:25:54.571 --> 02:25:56.132]  You know, I'm doing pretty good, Alex.
[02:25:56.652 --> 02:26:01.613]  This has been a banner year, an amazing year for We Are Change Colorado.
[02:26:01.653 --> 02:26:13.237]  One of the things I really wanted to talk about is how everybody says that what you're doing and the work we're doing is negative, but what I keep seeing is that the work we're doing is so incredibly positive.
[02:26:14.093 --> 02:26:27.183]  We just had an action yesterday actually at the DIA airport again and they kowtowed to us and gave us permits and I was amazed at how many people, and I've seen this change over time, are coming up to us.
[02:26:27.243 --> 02:26:29.905]  They're actually coming out of the crowd to us and they go,
[02:26:30.472 --> 02:26:31.773]  Do you know Alex Jones?
[02:26:32.053 --> 02:26:34.074]  Are you part of the Truth Movement?
[02:26:34.934 --> 02:26:41.318]  It's just really inspiring and it's really, really moving and I've seen the change over the last few years we've been doing this.
[02:26:41.418 --> 02:26:56.706]  I've seen the change in people and so I just gotta say, they want this shooter thing to keep us in the fear, keep us in the negativity, but it is so valuable to focus on the positive things that we're doing because it's amazing the effects that we're having on the world.
[02:26:56.786 --> 02:26:57.827]  It's just amazing.
[02:26:58.067 --> 02:27:14.137]  Exactly, and that's why the system is going to provocateur events, they're going to stage events, they're going to finance events, they're going to do whatever they can to, again, get us tattling on each other, 9,000 tattletale screens saying, watch your neighbor, watch other shoppers.
[02:27:14.577 --> 02:27:16.238]  They don't want us getting together.
[02:27:16.598 --> 02:27:23.923]  And they're desperately trying to make us not trust each other and to hate each other and kind of re-energize this whole left-right paradigm.
[02:27:24.443 --> 02:27:35.770]  And they force you to get into the left-right paradigm because when they attack the First Amendment and then make it about Republicans, it makes you come in and defend because you're having to defend everybody's rights.
[02:27:36.150 --> 02:27:40.833]  And back when I would defend Democrats' rights to speak under Bush, I was called a liberal.
[02:27:41.213 --> 02:27:44.575]  Now that I defend conservatives' rights, I'm called a right-winger.
[02:27:44.655 --> 02:27:48.057]  No, I'm a constitutionalist, and my job's easy.
[02:27:48.177 --> 02:27:50.978]  All I gotta do is go with common sense and the Bill of Rights.
[02:27:51.439 --> 02:27:53.440]  But, Law, you say you're seeing a big awakening.
[02:27:54.520 --> 02:27:55.040]  Definitely.
[02:27:55.400 --> 02:27:56.521]  There's no doubt about it.
[02:27:56.701 --> 02:27:58.342]  We've been doing this for several years.
[02:27:58.522 --> 02:28:01.444]  It used to be that when we got started, nobody would talk to us.
[02:28:01.544 --> 02:28:02.484]  No one would come up.
[02:28:03.304 --> 02:28:05.606]  We were always passing out information on DVDs.
[02:28:06.726 --> 02:28:08.847]  Now, people are actually seeking us out.
[02:28:08.887 --> 02:28:10.148]  They're asking, ìWhat do you got?
[02:28:10.208 --> 02:28:11.889]  What kind of videos have you got?î
[02:28:12.702 --> 02:28:17.124]  And so we load them up, we give them the information, and we tell them, you know, be positive.
[02:28:17.244 --> 02:28:18.925]  Don't let this fear get you down.
[02:28:18.985 --> 02:28:21.086]  I mean, this is how they control us.
[02:28:21.246 --> 02:28:33.551]  Well, let's go back two and a half years ago in October when we were at the DNC event in Denver, and there were people attacking us that work for MSNBC when they had an outside event going on.
[02:28:33.571 --> 02:28:34.892]  They didn't want to hear our views.
[02:28:35.732 --> 02:28:39.857]  Uh, back then, uh, you know, he had a million viewers on his show.
[02:28:39.917 --> 02:28:41.258]  Now it's less than half that.
[02:28:41.619 --> 02:28:44.942]  It just shows how the blood is running out of these people.
[02:28:45.563 --> 02:28:48.006]  Uh, they are losing their support.
[02:28:48.066 --> 02:28:49.587]  People are seeing through them.
[02:28:50.829 --> 02:28:51.409]  Definitely.
[02:28:51.449 --> 02:28:52.711]  There is no doubt about it.
[02:28:52.791 --> 02:28:54.313]  I mean, it is tangible.
[02:28:54.333 --> 02:28:55.594]  You can definitely see it.
[02:28:56.352 --> 02:28:59.634]  I think one of the things we do is we inspire so many people.
[02:28:59.694 --> 02:29:00.934]  I mean, we are change.
[02:29:01.335 --> 02:29:03.656]  The work that we do, you know, inspires people.
[02:29:03.716 --> 02:29:08.318]  The videos that we have up inspire people and that's really why we do it.
[02:29:08.358 --> 02:29:16.902]  In fact, I would like to tell people to go out to WACCTV on YouTube and check out some of these videos because, like I said, this year was a banner year.
[02:29:16.962 --> 02:29:20.844]  We went to Colorado Springs on the 9th anniversary to yell at Ollie North a little bit.
[02:29:21.644 --> 02:29:25.446]  Two of our guys got arrested and it was just quite a crazy scene.
[02:29:26.010 --> 02:29:39.199]  And then two weeks later we snuck into the hive while Newt Gingrich was in town with 2,500 neocon military industrial complexers and we disrupted that whole event and it was just, just fantastic.
[02:29:39.700 --> 02:29:43.402]  And out of this interesting thing we have... Stay there, finish up, Law on the other side.
[02:29:43.422 --> 02:29:45.764]  We'll be right back with more of your calls and more news.
[02:29:48.526 --> 02:29:51.528]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.449 --> 02:29:55.131]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:58.192 --> 02:30:06.035]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:30:06.295 --> 02:30:08.576]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:30:08.836 --> 02:30:14.038]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:30:14.218 --> 02:30:16.999]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:30:17.259 --> 02:30:19.340]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:30:19.580 --> 02:30:25.504]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:30:25.824 --> 02:30:29.026]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:30:29.206 --> 02:30:34.749]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:30:34.989 --> 02:30:36.310]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:30:36.630 --> 02:30:37.831]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:30:37.931 --> 02:30:40.493]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:30:40.613 --> 02:30:44.655]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:30:44.835 --> 02:30:46.857]  You can find the video at www.
[02:30:47.617 --> 02:30:49.319]  End of America 3.com.
[02:30:49.439 --> 02:30:51.901]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[02:30:52.021 --> 02:30:55.745]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:30:55.905 --> 02:30:56.906]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:30:58.268 --> 02:31:01.572]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[02:31:01.832 --> 02:31:02.913]  It ended on June of 2009.
[02:31:02.973 --> 02:31:07.338]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[02:31:07.538 --> 02:31:13.184]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[02:31:13.485 --> 02:31:15.467]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[02:31:15.627 --> 02:31:18.310]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[02:31:18.650 --> 02:31:24.951]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[02:31:25.151 --> 02:31:26.952]  They both make fabulous investments.
[02:31:27.352 --> 02:31:32.433]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[02:31:32.693 --> 02:31:37.694]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[02:31:37.974 --> 02:31:43.175]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[02:31:43.355 --> 02:31:44.815]  This will freeze the cost of your food.
[02:31:44.855 --> 02:31:45.175]  That's it!
[02:31:57.469 --> 02:32:01.712]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:32:02.032 --> 02:32:02.632]  Number 1.
[02:32:02.932 --> 02:32:06.094]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:32:06.355 --> 02:32:06.915]  Number 2.
[02:32:07.215 --> 02:32:11.778]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:32:12.118 --> 02:32:12.559]  It's true.
[02:32:12.859 --> 02:32:17.422]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:32:17.722 --> 02:32:18.282]  Number 3.
[02:32:18.562 --> 02:32:21.844]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:32:22.145 --> 02:32:25.847]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:32:26.047 --> 02:32:26.607]  Number four.
[02:32:26.847 --> 02:32:29.208]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:32:29.588 --> 02:32:32.989]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:32:33.269 --> 02:32:33.829]  Number five.
[02:32:34.069 --> 02:32:37.990]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:32:38.210 --> 02:32:42.972]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:32:43.252 --> 02:32:47.293]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:47.433 --> 02:32:48.994]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:49.234 --> 02:32:53.835]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[02:32:54.155 --> 02:32:54.676]  877-327-0365.
[02:32:57.521 --> 02:33:02.589]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:06.829 --> 02:33:10.232]  Okay, I said I'd get to your calls, and we've only been talking to one guy the last five minutes.
[02:33:10.252 --> 02:33:12.615]  I want to get to Patrick, Jeremy, Heather, Bob, and many others.
[02:33:12.975 --> 02:33:16.098]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[02:33:16.618 --> 02:33:20.362]  I've got a lot of other news I want to cram in here as well.
[02:33:21.062 --> 02:33:24.185]  We had Gerald Cilente, obviously, on last hour getting into the economy.
[02:33:24.626 --> 02:33:29.711]  Now CNBC admits, okay, housing market is slipping into depression territory.
[02:33:30.503 --> 02:33:34.165]  Well, according to all old-fashioned yardsticks, we're in a depression.
[02:33:34.846 --> 02:33:36.307]  And people say, well, be positive!
[02:33:36.827 --> 02:33:38.668]  Say we're not, and that'll bring confidence.
[02:33:39.169 --> 02:33:48.355]  When you've been de-industrialized, when 1.5 quadrillion in fake derivatives have been created by bipartisan criminals in both parties,
[02:33:50.242 --> 02:33:54.487]  It accelerated under Clinton, then Bush, now Obama.
[02:33:54.788 --> 02:34:00.495]  When you've got all this going on, nothing's going to get better until you reverse those policies.
[02:34:01.196 --> 02:34:04.040]  Not more of the same with now the daily
[02:34:05.046 --> 02:34:08.308]  JPMorgan Chase, mob boss, running the whole White House.
[02:34:08.668 --> 02:34:13.211]  But Law, finishing up, people should join We Are Change chapters all over the country.
[02:34:13.231 --> 02:34:20.515]  They're anti-tyranny, pro-liberty, non-partisan, exposing the fake global warming, 9-11, inside job, you name it.
[02:34:20.835 --> 02:34:21.856]  You guys are out there.
[02:34:22.456 --> 02:34:23.937]  Finishing up with the point you were making.
[02:34:24.577 --> 02:34:27.839]  Yeah, the point I wanted to make is our two guys got arrested.
[02:34:28.400 --> 02:34:30.841]  We've been fighting this court case now for three months.
[02:34:31.297 --> 02:34:33.718]  And we went in there to a Maritime Admiralty Court.
[02:34:33.758 --> 02:34:36.559]  We defended ourselves, and we actually beat them.
[02:34:37.059 --> 02:34:39.059]  And it was just an incredible feeling.
[02:34:39.199 --> 02:34:40.780]  You can represent yourself.
[02:34:40.900 --> 02:34:43.901]  You can stand up against these guys, and you can win.
[02:34:43.921 --> 02:34:50.563]  And it was just inspiring and an amazing thing to see my guys cross-examine the officers, work the DA.
[02:34:50.603 --> 02:34:52.203]  It was just incredible stuff.
[02:34:52.763 --> 02:34:56.104]  And like I was saying, the work we do is to inspire people.
[02:34:56.164 --> 02:34:58.845]  It's really to inspire them to get that spirit in their heart.
[02:34:59.281 --> 02:35:00.723]  You know, get them out there on the streets.
[02:35:00.843 --> 02:35:02.345]  Join a We Are Change chapter.
[02:35:02.745 --> 02:35:04.487]  I mean, we are making a huge difference.
[02:35:04.567 --> 02:35:07.491]  This is historical stuff that we are involved in here, Alex.
[02:35:07.591 --> 02:35:08.752]  Law, I appreciate your call.
[02:35:08.792 --> 02:35:09.894]  Good to hear from you again.
[02:35:10.815 --> 02:35:15.801]  It is historical what's happening, and there are certain times in history when
[02:35:17.011 --> 02:35:20.035]  The future destiny is really being set.
[02:35:20.977 --> 02:35:26.525]  Of course, Lenin talked about there are times when more happens in a month than happened in the last hundred years.
[02:35:27.466 --> 02:35:31.793]  And the political scientists talk about how normally society is frozen.
[02:35:33.049 --> 02:35:33.469]  We're good to go.
[02:35:48.704 --> 02:35:56.347]  And the system was trying to go into a liquefied phase to openly announce the world government, the global carbon taxes, the VAT.
[02:35:56.687 --> 02:36:04.490]  And they are successful to a certain extent, taking over Ireland, taking over Greece, now taking over Portugal, then England, Germany, France, the U.S.
[02:36:04.970 --> 02:36:07.091]  But it's all being called.
[02:36:07.731 --> 02:36:14.094]  So just because they're engaging in financial terrorism and financial warfare and consolidating power and scorched earth policy,
[02:36:15.154 --> 02:36:17.220]  The people are waking up in the process.
[02:36:17.641 --> 02:36:19.646]  And so that's the beginning of the end of this.
[02:36:20.694 --> 02:36:22.375]  We know what these big central banks do.
[02:36:22.976 --> 02:36:27.179]  They just rape and rob and pillage and destroy economies over and over again.
[02:36:27.459 --> 02:36:28.900]  There's never enough for them.
[02:36:29.560 --> 02:36:31.662]  They will suck your country dry.
[02:36:31.982 --> 02:36:33.103]  They will not quit.
[02:36:33.363 --> 02:36:37.026]  They want you to be bankrupt and poor so that you can't resist them.
[02:36:37.546 --> 02:36:38.627]  That's their policy.
[02:36:38.687 --> 02:36:40.909]  They want a post-industrial world.
[02:36:41.229 --> 02:36:47.734]  And they think they're going to sell Westerners on giving up our way of life, giving up our basic freedoms, giving up our industries,
[02:36:49.198 --> 02:36:52.639]  Not because of the depression they've engineered, but for the earth.
[02:36:52.759 --> 02:36:57.121]  Notice that's all being rolled out at the same time, of how chic it is to be poor.
[02:36:57.161 --> 02:37:01.243]  How chic it is to have austerity.
[02:37:02.003 --> 02:37:06.805]  All the trendy grocery stores and stuff here in Austin, you see, chic.
[02:37:07.105 --> 02:37:08.285]  It's chic to be poor.
[02:37:08.345 --> 02:37:09.926]  It's chic to have nothing.
[02:37:09.986 --> 02:37:12.087]  It's chic to pay lots of taxes.
[02:37:13.788 --> 02:37:15.268]  They're training you to love your enslavement.
[02:37:15.328 --> 02:37:16.969]  Patrick in South Carolina, you're on the air.
[02:37:18.234 --> 02:37:19.254]  Hello, Alex, can you hear me?
[02:37:19.555 --> 02:37:19.995]  Yes, sir.
[02:37:20.975 --> 02:37:21.736]  Alright, excellent.
[02:37:21.756 --> 02:37:25.797]  Your call operator said my phone has gone out, so I'm hoping you can hear me.
[02:37:26.318 --> 02:37:29.499]  Alright, I have a couple questions here, gonna be real quick.
[02:37:30.400 --> 02:37:37.583]  First one, what do you think about Jared, the Arizona Shooter's YouTube videos being all in text?
[02:37:38.103 --> 02:37:40.764]  If I'm to understand correctly, they are all in text, correct?
[02:37:41.605 --> 02:37:42.865]  Yes, that could be a setup.
[02:37:42.905 --> 02:37:43.886]  He could be being framed.
[02:37:44.921 --> 02:37:50.985]  Um, yeah, because I was, I thought that's what jumped out at me and a lot of your posters on your website, we were talking.
[02:37:51.025 --> 02:38:00.512]  Yeah, we just have a wide spectrum of neighbors, witnesses, and others, and unless they're all government, all putting out a disinfo story, which has happened before.
[02:38:00.592 --> 02:38:09.077]  On 9-11, they had all these suspicious guys with scripts on different news channels on the street, posing as citizens that we have identified was fake.
[02:38:09.958 --> 02:38:12.279]  But on this case, we don't know.
[02:38:13.500 --> 02:38:14.381]  But go ahead.
[02:38:15.381 --> 02:38:40.027]  Uh, the other point I was going to make about that was, uh, it seems like, because if it was, if it is fake in some way, those text YouTube videos, um, it would really blow the lid off this whole thing in the sense that, because it almost seems like in there, you know, when he talks about mind control or being a fan of mind control, all this mind control mentioning in those text videos, it's almost like then when one of us Patriots tries to expose what is going on and mention mind control,
[02:38:40.586 --> 02:38:51.160]  It's almost been conveniently placed in those text videos as like a psychological trigger to, since we're talking about mind control, it equated for people who don't understand.
[02:38:51.280 --> 02:38:54.585]  Absolutely, and I've made that point, and I'm glad that you made it here.
[02:38:55.886 --> 02:38:57.027]  You know, that's the problem.
[02:38:57.407 --> 02:39:16.402]  When you have declassified admissions of secret government mind control programs, where they put people on so many hallucinogens and give them shock therapy and other things that they enter a new reality, then they could implant a psychological compulsion to not rest until they've killed their targets.
[02:39:16.822 --> 02:39:17.823]  And that's what he told friends.
[02:39:17.863 --> 02:39:19.404]  He said, I cannot rest.
[02:39:19.504 --> 02:39:20.145]  I must do this.
[02:39:20.945 --> 02:39:34.776]  And it fits the MO of mind control, but being depressed, being ostracized, being rejected by women, taking hallucinogens on an almost daily basis, that can artificially whack you out.
[02:39:34.816 --> 02:39:36.057]  I mean, there's plenty of people.
[02:39:37.638 --> 02:39:38.579]  I can't tell you how many
[02:39:39.787 --> 02:39:40.647]  I don't know.
[02:40:00.012 --> 02:40:05.374]  And now we know why the cops have tried to, especially the political sheriff, keep all these details secret.
[02:40:05.634 --> 02:40:15.077]  Because they knew day one when they went to his house, they knew day one when they got all his materials, that he was obsessed and in love with her, and that he was completely whacked out on drugs.
[02:40:16.117 --> 02:40:17.419]  And that's not good for them.
[02:40:17.499 --> 02:40:19.761]  You know, they want to say, Freedom did this.
[02:40:19.861 --> 02:40:20.862]  America did this.
[02:40:21.203 --> 02:40:22.764]  So let's get rid of the First Amendment.
[02:40:23.065 --> 02:40:24.406]  Let's get rid of the Second Amendment.
[02:40:25.267 --> 02:40:27.309]  Because this guy was whacked out of his gourd.
[02:40:27.369 --> 02:40:28.730]  But really good points, Patrick.
[02:40:29.311 --> 02:40:31.213]  Let's talk to Jeremy in California.
[02:40:31.253 --> 02:40:32.174]  Jeremy, you're on the air.
[02:40:32.194 --> 02:40:34.717]  Hey Alex, good morning.
[02:40:34.737 --> 02:40:35.357]  Can you hear me?
[02:40:35.397 --> 02:40:35.698]  Yes, sir.
[02:40:36.741 --> 02:40:39.903]  Hey, I would like to say thank you for the wonderful job you're doing.
[02:40:40.023 --> 02:40:42.925]  I also go under and do entertainment myself.
[02:40:43.166 --> 02:40:47.288]  I feel, Alex, maybe... Well, to be clear, I'm not... I want to be clear.
[02:40:47.328 --> 02:40:48.229]  I'm not in entertainment.
[02:40:48.970 --> 02:40:52.272]  Like Rush Limbaugh says, he's an entertainer, and Glenn Beck says that.
[02:40:52.712 --> 02:40:54.613]  I eat, drink, and sleep this stuff.
[02:40:55.294 --> 02:40:57.896]  I get up here and get wound up on air, and I'm pretty confident.
[02:40:58.336 --> 02:41:00.578]  Last night, I was kind of freaking out.
[02:41:01.198 --> 02:41:07.966]  I got home, took a shower, ate dinner, was reading to the kids, and it was just dawning on me how crazy this world really is.
[02:41:08.667 --> 02:41:10.029]  So with me, it's not entertainment.
[02:41:10.069 --> 02:41:10.670]  Go ahead, Jeremy.
[02:41:11.410 --> 02:41:11.611]  Right.
[02:41:11.751 --> 02:41:19.220]  Alex, if you hear me out just one second, the entertainment and that you are feeding into right now, I understand your emotional
[02:41:19.665 --> 02:41:25.009]  On this topic that's been brought up to view on all of us, it is a tragedy, the loss of this nine-year-old.
[02:41:25.509 --> 02:41:28.711]  I myself am a father of three here in Northern California.
[02:41:29.212 --> 02:41:33.635]  I am just calling to let you know, sorry I get choked up talking about my children.
[02:41:33.995 --> 02:41:35.656]  I'm like you, I'm very passionate too.
[02:41:36.016 --> 02:41:45.383]  But the more we feed into the propaganda that they're feeding by bringing your name into the picture, you're getting up, what's going on right now with the birds?
[02:41:45.423 --> 02:41:47.124]  What's going on right now with the fish?
[02:41:47.484 --> 02:41:47.804]  Harp!
[02:41:48.064 --> 02:41:48.825]  Let's look at harp!
[02:41:50.041 --> 02:41:52.523]  I had an earthquake here in Northern California.
[02:41:52.563 --> 02:41:53.003]  You're right.
[02:41:53.043 --> 02:41:54.705]  There are floods worldwide.
[02:41:55.065 --> 02:41:56.887]  It is snowing in Hawaii.
[02:41:57.307 --> 02:41:58.468]  I've got the article right here.
[02:41:58.508 --> 02:42:00.270]  They admit they have weather weapons.
[02:42:00.590 --> 02:42:02.732]  We know there's giant chemtrailing programs.
[02:42:03.073 --> 02:42:04.714]  They have declassified a lot of it.
[02:42:05.014 --> 02:42:05.595]  And you're right.
[02:42:05.655 --> 02:42:13.843]  Instead of talking about all this crazy weather stuff that's accelerating, we're talking about the shooting and killing of six people, which is terrible.
[02:42:14.423 --> 02:42:21.253]  But in the scheme of things, 7 billion people almost worldwide, why do we still let the mainstream media set the agenda?
[02:42:21.514 --> 02:42:25.380]  They don't have a lot of viewers anymore, but they're still able to set some of the agenda.
[02:42:26.457 --> 02:42:29.738]  Alex, if I may have just five minutes of your time without you butting in.
[02:42:29.758 --> 02:42:30.098]  Go ahead.
[02:42:30.118 --> 02:42:31.419]  Let me present what I have.
[02:42:31.939 --> 02:42:37.780]  Okay, on the 8th in Northern California, we had dead birds drop here in Geyserville, California.
[02:42:38.181 --> 02:42:41.722]  Northern California, Geyserville, is an active volcano.
[02:42:41.742 --> 02:42:42.362]  Okay?
[02:42:42.702 --> 02:42:48.484]  HAARP, I've done my research, you could go on HAARP's website, look up the history, you could look at the bandwidth.
[02:42:49.084 --> 02:42:56.006]  On that night, on the Saturday, we did have a peak come down from our northern crest to HAARP, down through California.
[02:42:56.676 --> 02:42:59.898]  So, these are things we have to look at, Alex.
[02:43:00.278 --> 02:43:02.899]  I had an earthquake here last night also, right?
[02:43:03.319 --> 02:43:05.420]  HAARP was activated again last night.
[02:43:05.780 --> 02:43:07.261]  Same time we're having an earthquake.
[02:43:07.841 --> 02:43:09.582]  Everywhere these birds are dropping.
[02:43:09.962 --> 02:43:11.723]  I have papers from FEMA.
[02:43:12.103 --> 02:43:17.706]  We got contacted from FEMA because we have the plan for NLE2001.
[02:43:18.146 --> 02:43:19.026]  Okay?
[02:43:20.487 --> 02:43:24.669]  If you'd like to go and look at it yourself, I've been trying to call you with all this information.
[02:43:25.727 --> 02:43:29.810]  FEMA contacted my friend asking where we got these confidential papers.
[02:43:30.611 --> 02:43:32.993]  The guy's thing is Patriot Space.
[02:43:33.413 --> 02:43:35.735]  Patriot Space on YouTube.
[02:43:36.556 --> 02:43:47.084]  His informant is Jenny, who works for HAARP, or not for HAARP, excuse me, for FEMA and other nuclear emergency centers to draw these plans up.
[02:43:47.424 --> 02:43:49.405]  Well, it states here, NEL 2001, HAARP
[02:43:51.983 --> 02:43:55.165]  Activities and drills are scheduled by the White House.
[02:43:55.526 --> 02:44:01.870]  Directed concussionally, mandated exercise that includes participants of all appropriate field departments.
[02:44:02.790 --> 02:44:09.495]  Basically, Alex and May, they're planning to do the same exercises they did in Haiti, along the New Madrid fault line.
[02:44:10.055 --> 02:44:15.579]  But, if we had the master plan of 9-11, and we knew it, do you think they would do it?
[02:44:16.139 --> 02:44:16.420]  No.
[02:44:16.840 --> 02:44:21.163]  So maybe they're going to shift keys from the New Madrid fault line and say, hey,
[02:44:21.725 --> 02:44:23.423]  No, California, you're not safe.
[02:44:23.857 --> 02:44:25.398]  Maybe we're going to come take you out.
[02:44:25.758 --> 02:44:32.461]  But what I'm saying, Alex, there's a huge picture and you're getting blown over by the smoke, so you are entertaining right now.
[02:44:32.801 --> 02:44:36.182]  You're not doing the job of reporting.
[02:44:36.322 --> 02:44:38.863]  I'm evil and I'm bad, Jeremy, and I appreciate you instructing me.
[02:44:38.903 --> 02:44:39.284]  Thank you.
[02:44:40.484 --> 02:44:41.625]  We have covered HAARP.
[02:44:41.685 --> 02:44:43.345]  We have had Dr. Nick Begichon.
[02:44:44.226 --> 02:44:49.868]  And when we covered the birds extensively in HAARP and Tesla-type technologies, we were criticized for that.
[02:44:51.849 --> 02:45:13.024]  I mean it is my radio show and so if you take offense at you saying you know while you're entertaining and I say look I just want to be clear I'm I don't see my show as entertainment okay okay I don't see it as entertainment sometimes I do entertaining things because when you're on the air three four hours a day sometimes I'm not in this focused emote but
[02:45:16.104 --> 02:45:20.829]  Look, I just suggest, I try to be a platform for other people, organizations, groups.
[02:45:21.230 --> 02:45:22.011]  I try my best.
[02:45:22.051 --> 02:45:23.553]  But let's just say I'm trash.
[02:45:23.633 --> 02:45:24.173]  I'm scum.
[02:45:24.233 --> 02:45:24.674]  I'm filth.
[02:45:24.734 --> 02:45:25.295]  I'm worthless.
[02:45:25.675 --> 02:45:26.196]  I'm no good.
[02:45:26.316 --> 02:45:27.757]  I apologize for everything I've done.
[02:45:28.198 --> 02:45:29.659]  Now, let's move on from there.
[02:45:31.724 --> 02:45:32.945]  There are weather weapons.
[02:45:33.445 --> 02:45:35.346]  There are things going on out there.
[02:45:35.366 --> 02:45:38.208]  I know about national-level exercises.
[02:45:38.248 --> 02:45:40.209]  FEMA, a lot of times, puts out public things.
[02:45:40.590 --> 02:45:41.810]  I'll check into what you're saying.
[02:45:42.130 --> 02:45:46.033]  Why don't you send it over to ShowTipsAtInfoWars.com?
[02:45:46.093 --> 02:45:47.614]  You may have tried to get it to me a couple times.
[02:45:48.074 --> 02:45:51.937]  We just get a lot of spam and stuff, so good stuff gets lost in the mix.
[02:45:51.957 --> 02:45:54.698]  Okay, now let's move on to the next person.
[02:45:55.359 --> 02:45:58.501]  Let's go ahead and talk to Heather in Indiana.
[02:45:58.841 --> 02:45:59.942]  Heather, you're on the air.
[02:45:59.962 --> 02:46:00.322]  Go ahead.
[02:46:01.172 --> 02:46:06.293]  Hi Alex, I was listening to your last caller while I was on hold, and my God, people are just crazy.
[02:46:06.553 --> 02:46:09.054]  And I want to applaud you and me and my family for you.
[02:46:09.074 --> 02:46:09.274]  No, I'm bad.
[02:46:09.354 --> 02:46:10.254]  No ma'am, I'm bad.
[02:46:10.594 --> 02:46:10.894]  I'm bad.
[02:46:10.934 --> 02:46:11.194]  Go ahead.
[02:46:11.394 --> 02:46:13.154]  Oh my gosh, but you're excellent.
[02:46:13.474 --> 02:46:20.696]  We have all your videos, we give them to people, and you have done a fabulous job in waking up so many people who have had their eyes shut for so long.
[02:46:21.216 --> 02:46:28.037]  But I'm calling to ask you a question because I listened to a show previously, not too far in the past, about a woman who had called in.
[02:46:28.357 --> 02:46:30.818]  She was very emotional and crying, but they were doing
[02:46:31.747 --> 02:46:32.328]  Yeah, I'm good.
[02:46:32.388 --> 02:46:32.688]  I'm good.
[02:47:02.071 --> 02:47:10.414]  Is it a good thing to go against them if you have endangered species that that supposed chemical maybe couldn't come in contact with?
[02:47:10.494 --> 02:47:11.974]  I'm just trying to... Well, here's the problem.
[02:47:12.014 --> 02:47:19.397]  You can use their baloney loopholes, but a lot of times if it's not them using the loophole, then they'll kind of ignore you.
[02:47:19.417 --> 02:47:29.020]  I mean, you know, the biggest issue is they do spray a lot of experimental things to take out different insects and moths, and a lot of times it's really just a kickback to their buddies.
[02:47:29.700 --> 02:47:32.782]  Uh, you know, for the state or county to make purchases of those chemicals.
[02:47:33.302 --> 02:47:36.604]  And you just gotta do a four year of what type of chemical they're spraying.
[02:47:36.944 --> 02:47:40.165]  And a lot of times they're not authorized to be doing what they're doing.
[02:47:40.205 --> 02:47:49.410]  And as soon as you then fax that out to all the newspapers, it's gonna end up being in the newspaper and that program is gonna get shut down very, very quickly.
[02:47:49.430 --> 02:47:50.891]  Uh, anything else?
[02:47:52.170 --> 02:47:53.791]  No, I just wanted your opinion on that.
[02:47:53.831 --> 02:47:56.912]  We listen to you all the time and listening to previous callers.
[02:47:56.952 --> 02:48:02.815]  We just wanted your opinion on how to do the right thing and possibly not get shot down right away.
[02:48:03.618 --> 02:48:09.203]  Sure, well, I mean, every case is different, every geographic area is different, every, you know, the specifics of it, I don't know.
[02:48:09.603 --> 02:48:13.066]  But just get your facts pretty much straight and then take action and stand up for yourself.
[02:48:13.486 --> 02:48:20.392]  And even if you're not fighting the most important issue, or even if you're not 100% right, getting involved in your government is the answer.
[02:48:20.432 --> 02:48:21.013]  God bless you.
[02:48:21.413 --> 02:48:24.056]  And going back to Jeremy, you know, that happens sometimes when I'm taking calls.
[02:48:25.096 --> 02:48:35.644]  People think, you know, they're going to go for ten minutes and when I have time to get to other people, and then I do shut up so they can run on, and at the end there's the diss that I'm bad, and then I tend to get a little sarcastic about that.
[02:48:36.245 --> 02:48:38.647]  Look, we don't need to fight with each other.
[02:48:39.367 --> 02:48:41.949]  We need to deal with the dollar devaluation.
[02:48:42.590 --> 02:48:45.072]  We need to deal with the loss of liberty that's happening.
[02:48:45.712 --> 02:48:50.195]  And, you know, I tried to even nicely agree with Jeremy and say, yeah, there is a lot of
[02:48:51.189 --> 02:48:52.390]  Crazy weather going on.
[02:48:53.150 --> 02:48:55.252]  But a lot of that is dealing with the moon and sun cycles.
[02:48:55.292 --> 02:48:56.953]  We've had top meteorologists on with that.
[02:48:57.393 --> 02:48:58.694]  Yes, there are weather weapons.
[02:48:59.074 --> 02:49:00.935]  Yes, there's chemtrail programs going on.
[02:49:01.416 --> 02:49:03.677]  Yes, I've done countless shows about that.
[02:49:03.737 --> 02:49:06.259]  It's not my fault this is going on.
[02:49:06.539 --> 02:49:07.660]  I'm not the bad man.
[02:49:08.160 --> 02:49:09.901]  I know I'm the person that'll take the call.
[02:49:10.221 --> 02:49:10.922]  Government won't.
[02:49:11.202 --> 02:49:12.163]  You can talk to me.
[02:49:12.783 --> 02:49:15.545]  And so if I need to be the bad man, I can be that for you.
[02:49:16.005 --> 02:49:18.727]  But on a larger issue, just so you understand,
[02:49:20.299 --> 02:49:29.585]  I agreed with you that it's a distraction at a certain level to spend a bunch of time talking about the shooting in Tucson, because there's other bigger things going on.
[02:49:31.386 --> 02:49:34.608]  But you can't please everybody with what you cover or what you go over.
[02:49:34.748 --> 02:49:39.811]  And you have to understand, yes, they're overblowing it as bad as it is, because they personalize it.
[02:49:40.012 --> 02:49:42.213]  They show you who these people are.
[02:49:42.493 --> 02:49:44.614]  They humanize it.
[02:49:45.255 --> 02:49:48.217]  But when they're killing a million plus Iraqis, they don't humanize it.
[02:49:49.241 --> 02:49:49.561]  Okay?
[02:49:49.842 --> 02:49:51.103]  They don't put a human face on it.
[02:49:51.804 --> 02:50:03.276]  But they're using this to try to pass legislation against the First Amendment, to take over talk radio and media and the internet, and to restrict the Second Amendment.
[02:50:03.476 --> 02:50:06.399]  Now, it doesn't get any bigger than that, Bubba.
[02:50:06.740 --> 02:50:09.643]  That's your capacity to have a radio show or call into one.
[02:50:10.649 --> 02:50:19.140]  So, yes, in and of itself, it's an overblown diversion, but we have to fight them in the media war and fight their lies.
[02:50:19.660 --> 02:50:24.847]  And whereas 20 years ago, or even 10, we'd lose almost every battle, now we're winning almost every battle.
[02:50:25.668 --> 02:50:28.791]  Three, four days into this, now it's common knowledge that
[02:50:29.810 --> 02:50:32.711]  He was basically in love with her, obsessed with her, and on drugs.
[02:50:33.312 --> 02:50:35.933]  And it wasn't liberals' fault, it wasn't conservatives' fault.
[02:50:36.333 --> 02:50:39.935]  So they can't demonize collectively and take all of our liberties.
[02:50:40.555 --> 02:50:42.917]  So, this is a big issue.
[02:50:43.617 --> 02:50:49.820]  Trying to take our First Amendment, trying to take our Second Amendment, they're getting on the news saying, I'm guilty.
[02:50:50.500 --> 02:50:53.362]  They're saying, I'm behind this little girl's death.
[02:50:53.742 --> 02:50:55.003]  That's a big deal, buddy!
[02:50:55.383 --> 02:50:56.183]  You understand that?
[02:50:56.543 --> 02:50:57.184]  We'll be right back.
[02:50:59.597 --> 02:51:03.241]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:51:03.641 --> 02:51:06.624]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:51:06.865 --> 02:51:11.650]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:51:11.670 --> 02:51:17.936]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:51:18.076 --> 02:51:20.299]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:51:20.839 --> 02:51:21.639]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:51:21.659 --> 02:51:22.300]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:51:22.380 --> 02:51:24.040]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:51:39.727 --> 02:51:41.550]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:51:41.570 --> 02:51:46.696]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:52:12.888 --> 02:52:15.029]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[02:52:15.309 --> 02:52:21.271]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.

[02:54:15.523 --> 02:54:20.344]  I'm boxing my crew now and I've gone around to everybody and said, have you ever taken this salvia stuff?
[02:54:20.984 --> 02:54:25.145]  And I found one person that has and they said you black out for about 20 minutes.
[02:54:26.745 --> 02:54:33.746]  And that's what the encyclopedia says of drugs online, is that you literally, quote, disassociate.
[02:54:33.766 --> 02:54:36.567]  I mean, that sounds like mind control 101.
[02:54:37.487 --> 02:54:40.488]  And this guy was reportedly doing it, quote, almost every day.
[02:54:40.828 --> 02:54:42.408]  This is what his friends and neighbors said.
[02:54:44.614 --> 02:54:45.994]  And Rush Limbaugh's to blame.
[02:54:46.875 --> 02:54:51.896]  I guess Rush Limbaugh is into Oxycontin, but I mean, different strokes for different folks.
[02:54:52.536 --> 02:54:55.877]  Man, I would be scared to take something that makes you completely not know who you are.
[02:54:56.537 --> 02:55:01.318]  I mean, I've heard of hallucinogens that make you see funny stuff and things, and I'm scared of that.
[02:55:01.818 --> 02:55:04.899]  Can you imagine taking something where you don't even know who you are?
[02:55:06.439 --> 02:55:07.680]  How long were you saying it lasts?
[02:55:07.700 --> 02:55:08.680]  Because that's what I read, 20-30 minutes?
[02:55:12.199 --> 02:55:13.179]  And you don't know who you are.
[02:55:13.199 --> 02:55:15.020]  We're not going to say what crew member's taking it.
[02:55:15.800 --> 02:55:17.160]  How many years ago was this?
[02:55:19.501 --> 02:55:20.241]  Two years ago.
[02:55:20.301 --> 02:55:21.401]  Just at parties now.
[02:55:21.421 --> 02:55:22.041]  It's just everywhere.
[02:55:22.321 --> 02:55:24.482]  That's what Eric Mancow-Muller was saying earlier.
[02:55:24.862 --> 02:55:30.143]  He says he just goes to mainline parties and it's just... In fact, I've read about this in the paper before.
[02:55:30.163 --> 02:55:32.444]  I didn't really know what it was because I don't pay attention to drug culture.
[02:55:32.844 --> 02:55:34.044]  This is sold at like...
[02:55:34.912 --> 02:55:39.916]  Tobacco stores, head shops, yeah, where you buy, like, weed head pipes.
[02:55:40.997 --> 02:55:44.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, arrest all these people immediately.
[02:55:45.600 --> 02:55:54.087]  No, I mean, I'm joking around about that, but why do I get blamed for some guy, a liberal, smoking basically natural PCP?
[02:55:54.387 --> 02:55:55.688]  Why am I being blamed for this?
[02:55:57.269 --> 02:56:02.794]  Bill Clinton's back in the news going, I don't care what people say, this was politically motivated, I believe.
[02:56:04.099 --> 02:56:06.121]  I did not have sex with that woman, by the way.
[02:56:06.161 --> 02:56:08.162]  And getting rid of Glass-Steagall's gonna be great.
[02:56:08.262 --> 02:56:09.623]  Asked my Commerce Secretary.
[02:56:10.044 --> 02:56:11.365]  Oh, he got shot in the head.
[02:56:12.445 --> 02:56:15.368]  Then I pointed, this guy is now running the White House daily.
[02:56:15.728 --> 02:56:17.009]  He comes from a good family.
[02:56:17.049 --> 02:56:18.250]  They work with Al Capone.
[02:56:21.232 --> 02:56:22.493]  Your speech is dangerous.
[02:56:22.553 --> 02:56:23.133]  Shut up!
[02:56:24.194 --> 02:56:24.895]  All these headlines.
[02:56:24.955 --> 02:56:26.036]  Speech is dangerous.
[02:56:26.316 --> 02:56:27.257]  Restrict speech.
[02:56:27.917 --> 02:56:28.798]  Who's up next here, John?
[02:56:31.618 --> 02:56:34.439]  Should I go into overdrive or should I not to get to all these calls?
[02:56:34.599 --> 02:56:35.719]  I am a bad person.
[02:56:36.199 --> 02:56:37.740]  Bob in California.
[02:56:38.080 --> 02:56:39.120]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:56:40.241 --> 02:56:41.481]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:56:41.501 --> 02:56:43.001]  There was two points I'd like to make.
[02:56:43.602 --> 02:56:56.645]  I don't recall the details because the event occurred in the thirties, but President Roosevelt and a mayor of, I believe, Miami were on the platform together and a nutcase shot and killed the mayor.
[02:56:57.026 --> 02:56:58.266]  Well, that's Rush Limbaugh's fault.
[02:56:59.008 --> 02:57:01.710]  Well, anyhow, I don't know about that, but let me finish my story.
[02:57:02.170 --> 02:57:09.296]  So anyhow, they arrested the guy immediately, indicted him quickly, tried him promptly, and executed him within 30 days.
[02:57:09.916 --> 02:57:11.137]  There was no screwing around.
[02:57:11.157 --> 02:57:14.340]  He was obviously the victim, the culprit.
[02:57:14.380 --> 02:57:16.441]  There was no doubt about who did what.
[02:57:16.521 --> 02:57:19.123]  Just as in this case, there's no doubt about who did what.
[02:57:19.844 --> 02:57:24.888]  And to drag this out for months and months and months at the expense of the taxpayers is ridiculous.
[02:57:25.568 --> 02:57:27.310]  So that's a precedent that was set in the 30s.
[02:57:28.447 --> 02:57:36.010]  Then the other item I'd like to bring to your attention is this great talk about joblessness and they're going to create jobs and all this foolishness.
[02:57:36.710 --> 02:57:40.712]  There's only one way to create jobs and that's to eliminate the minimum wage law.
[02:57:41.632 --> 02:57:51.276]  There's a lot of people that would work happily for say $7 an hour and there's a lot of employers that would hire them for $7 an hour, but both of them would be termed criminals
[02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:55.241]  By these people who are on the gravy train with government paychecks.
[02:57:55.281 --> 02:57:58.062]  Well, you know, you know, it sounds like you've been an employer.
[02:57:58.542 --> 02:58:08.265]  When somebody's getting seven bucks an hour or whatever the minimum wage is now, I forget what is it now, but you've got to do their social security matching, their FICA and all that.
[02:58:08.545 --> 02:58:11.446]  So somebody getting seven bucks an hour is really getting more like 11 or 12.
[02:58:12.186 --> 02:58:13.687]  Somebody getting 15 is getting like 21.
[02:58:14.507 --> 02:58:15.867]  Somebody getting 20 is getting like 30.
[02:58:16.027 --> 02:58:17.868]  I mean, that's the big secret here.
[02:58:18.865 --> 02:58:22.489]  The issue I'm trying to make is you're a staunch advocate of freedom.
[02:58:22.929 --> 02:58:36.484]  When a man who's adult and in his own senses is willing to work for $7 an hour and an employer is willing to hire him, and the two of them agree to agree, and then to have some third party who has no... Stay there, we're going into overdrive!

[02:59:46.650 --> 02:59:47.091]  Thank you.
[02:59:49.072 --> 02:59:50.233]  Coast to Coast.
[02:59:50.594 --> 02:59:52.055]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:52.655 --> 02:59:55.878]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:04.822 --> 03:00:10.744]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:10.764 --> 03:00:16.045]  All right, let's go back to Bob in California.
[03:00:16.105 --> 03:00:18.066]  Instead of Bob, I could name him Poutis.
[03:00:19.126 --> 03:00:23.367]  Because he was pouting, I'm joking, about my joke about Rush Limbaugh.
[03:00:23.387 --> 03:00:25.888]  It must have been his fault that the mayor got shot with Roosevelt.
[03:00:26.428 --> 03:00:27.728]  But that's a really good point.
[03:00:28.068 --> 03:00:31.289]  You know, we've had people killing presidents, killing members of Congress.
[03:00:31.949 --> 03:00:33.430]  You know, it's always happened.
[03:00:34.130 --> 03:00:36.031]  And it's going to continue to happen.
[03:00:36.591 --> 03:00:45.176]  Why should we give up our liberties today because somebody's smoking organic PCP and is in love with the Congresswoman?
[03:00:45.196 --> 03:00:46.096]  That's not my fault.
[03:00:46.316 --> 03:00:48.837]  But you were finishing up your point briefly, Bob, about the minimum wage.
[03:00:49.198 --> 03:00:54.600]  Yes, in a free country we should be able to pay people whatever we want, and they should be free to take that job or not.
[03:00:54.620 --> 03:01:00.103]  The big dirty secret is the illegals will take the lower, and that's why people hire the illegals.
[03:01:00.463 --> 03:01:01.844]  It's all been set up that way, Bob.
[03:01:02.899 --> 03:01:04.059]  I don't know that background.
[03:01:04.119 --> 03:01:11.521]  All I knew, though, the greatest freedom ever was to be able to do what you want to for whatever you want, as long as it wasn't criminal.
[03:01:12.222 --> 03:01:14.442]  And this is ridiculous here.
[03:01:14.482 --> 03:01:23.405]  We have, in fact, I think it was the state of Washington and two or three other states just raised the minimum wage, which cuts down employment as it goes.
[03:01:23.485 --> 03:01:27.866]  So what we need to do is to return to the open, free market.
[03:01:28.487 --> 03:01:30.308]  And let people do what they want to do.
[03:01:30.328 --> 03:01:31.728]  I agree and I appreciate your call.
[03:01:31.788 --> 03:01:37.010]  Instead all they're doing is blaming the unfree market for our downfall.
[03:01:37.511 --> 03:01:39.071]  And saying capitalism did this.
[03:01:39.491 --> 03:01:42.093]  Folks, this isn't free market what we're seeing happen right now.
[03:01:42.853 --> 03:01:46.554]  A bunch of insider bankers looting everything and writing laws to shut down their competition.
[03:01:46.994 --> 03:01:48.035]  Brian in Iowa.
[03:01:48.055 --> 03:01:49.115]  Brian, you're on the air.
[03:01:49.936 --> 03:01:50.916]  Hey, how's it going Alex?
[03:01:50.936 --> 03:01:51.936]  What's up?
[03:01:51.956 --> 03:01:52.037]  Good.
[03:01:52.077 --> 03:01:52.897]  Worldwide broadcast.
[03:01:53.513 --> 03:01:55.333]  Yeah, I have a question for you.
[03:01:56.014 --> 03:02:01.055]  Recently, former politician Tom DeLay was found guilty.
[03:02:01.075 --> 03:02:02.435]  Three years in prison.
[03:02:03.176 --> 03:02:04.136]  Yeah.
[03:02:04.356 --> 03:02:12.698]  My question is, by the way, he was also let out during the appeal process, which is kind of odd.
[03:02:13.507 --> 03:02:18.451]  And my question is, why is it that there's selective law enforcement in this country?
[03:02:18.671 --> 03:02:24.755]  Well, Austin is, again, very communistic because the citizens don't get involved.
[03:02:24.815 --> 03:02:30.980]  It's actually very libertarian and free and great people, but a hardcore group of crooks calling themselves communists run the city.
[03:02:31.200 --> 03:02:32.421]  They steal property.
[03:02:33.501 --> 03:02:34.562]  But they pose as liberal.
[03:02:34.602 --> 03:02:35.983]  They make us pay for abortions.
[03:02:36.344 --> 03:02:37.765]  I have to pay for people's abortions.
[03:02:38.005 --> 03:02:39.446]  That's why I've moved out of Austin.
[03:02:39.926 --> 03:02:41.727]  They still get taxes off this office, though.
[03:02:42.568 --> 03:02:43.689]  It really frustrates me.
[03:02:44.849 --> 03:02:47.690]  And they are constantly on political witch hunts.
[03:02:48.051 --> 03:02:50.612]  I'm no fan of Tom DeLay, but I've followed the case.
[03:02:51.152 --> 03:02:52.853]  And he did what both parties do.
[03:02:52.873 --> 03:02:56.595]  I mean, you know, they swap federal for state money.
[03:02:57.195 --> 03:02:58.556]  And that's how the whole thing works.
[03:02:58.796 --> 03:03:03.238]  And it's a political witch hunt by Ronnie Earl, the former district attorney here.
[03:03:03.318 --> 03:03:04.699]  So, yeah, that's the bottom line.
[03:03:05.539 --> 03:03:09.601]  Yeah, I just think it's kind of odd how the judicial system is doing quickly.
[03:03:10.290 --> 03:03:12.392]  Well, I mean, you know why nobody files against George W. Bush.
[03:03:12.412 --> 03:03:12.973]  I appreciate your call.
[03:03:33.371 --> 03:03:38.317]  When you're at that high level of government, you know all the secrets and the dirt on everybody.
[03:03:38.798 --> 03:03:46.907]  You think WikiLeaks is threatening people with the stuff they've got to back off or they'll release stuff on Rupert Murdoch and the Chinese and the Israelis and everybody else.
[03:03:47.248 --> 03:03:49.631]  Can you imagine what a George Bush knows or a Bill Clinton?
[03:03:51.001 --> 03:03:52.683]  That's why they're seen as untouchable.
[03:03:53.123 --> 03:03:57.087]  That's why Clinton leaves office, George W. Bush protects him.
[03:03:57.628 --> 03:04:00.171]  And then George W. Bush leaves office and Obama protects him.
[03:04:00.531 --> 03:04:01.792]  They're going to protect each other.
[03:04:01.812 --> 03:04:03.614]  In fact, I meant to get to that today.
[03:04:04.542 --> 03:04:12.109]  I mean, have you seen all the news articles about all these top lobbyists, the very day of the energy company mergers, burning up in their cars?
[03:04:13.109 --> 03:04:22.437]  Top Bush aides, you know, that head up Fortune 500 companies, running around with their, you know, disheveled and being found dead in trash piles, killed professionally.
[03:04:23.158 --> 03:04:24.519]  Bombs at the neighbor's house.
[03:04:25.920 --> 03:04:31.966]  Top political operatives in Arizona being killed separately here.
[03:04:33.777 --> 03:04:37.141]  Ex-Arizona, top Senate aide found shot to death.
[03:04:38.002 --> 03:04:42.046]  Lobbyist Ashley Turton found dead in a home in D.C.
[03:04:42.066 --> 03:04:46.611]  I mean, it's, come on, they're killing people left and right.
[03:04:46.631 --> 03:04:48.352]  There's big moves going on right now.
[03:04:48.973 --> 03:04:51.616]  Big moves, big mafia moves going on right now.
[03:04:52.156 --> 03:04:54.499]  Key information coming up straight ahead in pollwars.com.
[03:04:58.240 --> 03:05:04.990]  There are many types of storable foods, but how about a superfood that contains every nutrient that the human body needs for survival?
[03:05:05.591 --> 03:05:12.602]  50% protein, 300 milligrams of potassium per ounce, and calcium and magnesium for your heart and bones, with many more
