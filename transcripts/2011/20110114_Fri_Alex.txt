[00:00:04.632 --> 00:00:05.273]  Big Brother.
[00:00:05.953 --> 00:00:06.974]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.715 --> 00:00:08.855]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.476 --> 00:00:10.316]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.057 --> 00:00:12.018]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.598 --> 00:00:16.201]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:20.904]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.762 --> 00:00:36.705]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:36.925 --> 00:00:37.407]  Welcome.
[00:00:37.427 --> 00:00:38.650]  It is Friday, the 14th day of January, 2011.
[00:00:44.045 --> 00:00:58.158]  It seems like five minutes ago, it was last Friday, and we had Bob Chapman on dropping those bombshells on Ronald Reagan and others and talking about the CMP and how the establishment controls the right wing as well as the left wing.
[00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:06.005]  We have a big video we just posted today, actually last night, at PrisonPlanet.tv, part one of a two-hour
[00:01:06.926 --> 00:01:08.687]  In-person interview with Joel Skousen.
[00:01:09.628 --> 00:01:25.998]  He was involved right at the beginning of the CMP and other major conservative organizations and breaks down how the Tea Party today is being infiltrated and taken over yet again and goes through all the major conservative players and from his intelligence and research who they exactly work for.
[00:01:26.018 --> 00:01:28.659]  And that's up on PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:36.164]  Again, it is Friday and we have Dr. Joel Wallach who I had on last year and people really wanted to have him come back to the show.
[00:01:37.782 --> 00:01:37.882]  And
[00:01:52.602 --> 00:02:09.530]  Of course there are countless studies that show this and I've worked for a large animal vet, a small animal vet and I remember vets saying, you know, get more of this mineral, get more of that vitamin for your animal and that was always the first course of action when they identified things that weren't like a broken leg or
[00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.953]  Uh, you know, a prolapse or a miscarriage in a cow.
[00:02:15.634 --> 00:02:27.482]  I mean, a lot of times it was mineral in nature, but big mainline modern medicine doesn't ever want to give you things that are preventative or things that don't cut, burn, or poison.
[00:02:27.823 --> 00:02:34.688]  They want to respond to what the lack of minerals and nutrients has caused and treat
[00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:43.241]  Uh, the, uh, crisis that has occurred instead of, uh, actually, uh, heading it off at the pass.
[00:02:43.541 --> 00:02:50.031]  So I wanted to have, uh, Dr. Joel Wallach, of course, Dead Doctors Don't Lie, in the name of his syndicated radio program.
[00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:51.729]  I don't know.
[00:03:16.198 --> 00:03:23.896]  in Tucson and we've had to do that because it's been used as a establishment move
[00:03:25.416 --> 00:03:35.579]  A counter-revolution against the American people who are trying to take their country back as a way to demonize the First Amendment and to savage the Second Amendment as well.
[00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:49.963]  And so, though it was pretty much a hyped-up, blown-out-of-proportion media spectacle bordering on hoax, certainly a hoax that he was a conservative or that he was politically motivated, we now know that was a hoax, that component of it.
[00:03:51.328 --> 00:03:55.290]  We had to respond to it because it was a major globalist propaganda offensive.
[00:03:55.611 --> 00:03:57.072]  It's now blown up in their face.
[00:03:57.712 --> 00:04:10.880]  So the event itself is a diversion and a distraction that they've hyped up, but by resisting it, you educate people about their different propaganda programs and their different dirty tricks, and you also then
[00:04:13.388 --> 00:04:19.191]  Snatch victory out of the jaws of defeat, and really rout the enemy once again.
[00:04:19.251 --> 00:04:23.433]  And that has now happened, and they are running with their tail behind their legs yet again.
[00:04:23.473 --> 00:04:31.337]  This is not 10, 15 years ago where the feds could bomb Oklahoma City and teach us all to worship black uniforms and lick their boots and cower in fear.
[00:04:32.057 --> 00:04:37.700]  People more and more are aware of how they seize on crises, create crises, and it hasn't worked.
[00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.661]  That said, they don't care.
[00:04:39.681 --> 00:04:45.084]  They're barreling on down the road with incredible developments.
[00:04:45.564 --> 00:04:50.687]  FBI targets critics of government with home visits after Arizona shootings.
[00:04:50.707 --> 00:04:52.668]  That's coming up after the break.
[00:04:53.368 --> 00:04:56.730]  And what's happening with Mexican gunmen firing at US workers.
[00:05:00.114 --> 00:05:01.715]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.

[00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:02.212]  Folks, you've heard us talk about Home Gain before.

[00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.883]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:07:03.163 --> 00:07:04.244]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:07:04.464 --> 00:07:08.648]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:07:08.848 --> 00:07:14.513]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:07:14.794 --> 00:07:16.795]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:07:16.955 --> 00:07:19.638]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[00:07:19.978 --> 00:07:26.281]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoodsDirect.
[00:07:26.462 --> 00:07:28.283]  They both make fabulous investments.
[00:07:28.683 --> 00:07:33.745]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[00:07:34.026 --> 00:07:39.008]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[00:07:39.308 --> 00:07:44.511]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[00:07:44.671 --> 00:07:47.613]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[00:07:47.853 --> 00:07:50.815]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[00:07:50.915 --> 00:07:52.556]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[00:07:52.596 --> 00:07:55.598]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:37.504]  It is Friday the 14th day of January 2011 Bob Chapman joining us on different developments in the economy and geopolitically as he always does coming up today in the third hour we have
[00:08:39.042 --> 00:08:46.846]  Dr. Joe Wallach joining us, who was a doctor of veterinary medicine, but also of naturopathic medicine.
[00:08:47.266 --> 00:08:48.167]  ND, not MD.
[00:08:49.147 --> 00:09:01.453]  And he is going to be joining us coming up to get into what's causing so many of the illnesses and diseases in this country, is lack of minerals and vitamins.
[00:09:01.754 --> 00:09:05.836]  And the system knows this, but they want to treat the results
[00:09:06.756 --> 00:09:31.544]  uh... of the lack of minerals and vitamins and other trace elements and uh... nutrients uh... instead of giving you the things that are preventative and so i want to be talking with him coming up later in the next hour also are you notice last week the federal government had to admit that sodium fluoride is causing dental fluorosis and a lot of other degenerative type diseases and problems now we're seeing an almost near reversal
[00:09:32.504 --> 00:09:47.815]  And they're doing that because they know that there is massive resistance building worldwide, not to just things like NAFTA and GATT or the World Trade Organization or the Private Fellow Reserve or the TSA, but on fluoride.
[00:09:47.855 --> 00:09:56.021]  Lawsuits are being filed at city and county level as people discover that it's a listed poison and that other poisons are being added under the name fluoride.
[00:09:58.479 --> 00:10:07.405]  The vast majority, over 90% of toxicologists, scientists, neurologists are going public, writing books, signing petitions.
[00:10:08.466 --> 00:10:16.592]  The major unions of the Food and Drug Administration and the EPA have gone to Congress in the last 11 years, multiple times.
[00:10:17.253 --> 00:10:19.874]  I mean, it's building towards a crescendo.
[00:10:20.735 --> 00:10:27.160]  And so the establishment is saying, okay, we'll cut it from 1.2 parts per million
[00:10:29.824 --> 00:10:31.925]  And some places it's as high as four parts per million.
[00:10:32.486 --> 00:10:48.356]  We'll cut it down to maybe three parts, or 0.3 parts per million, or 0.5 parts per million, because they are already moved on to using sodium fluoride as a pesticide on crops, and it goes through the cell wall and bioaccumulates.
[00:10:48.836 --> 00:10:57.822]  They've already got the chemical weapons system in literally thousands of processed foods at levels hundreds of times above one part per million.
[00:10:58.635 --> 00:11:02.607]  I mean, I've seen cases of it in powdered eggs of 600 parts per million.
[00:11:02.647 --> 00:11:03.430]  I mean, it's just...
[00:11:04.548 --> 00:11:08.870]  I always wondered why, growing up, if I was on a camp out or something and ate powdered eggs, I'd throw up.
[00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:10.631]  I mean, I'm somebody who loves eggs.
[00:11:10.671 --> 00:11:11.931]  My body was like poison.
[00:11:11.951 --> 00:11:13.852]  You know, danger, Will Robinson.
[00:11:15.032 --> 00:11:19.934]  And they're also, of course, in the toothpaste, it's hundreds of times above one part per million.
[00:11:20.175 --> 00:11:22.215]  So they're hitting you and hitting you hard there.
[00:11:22.436 --> 00:11:24.897]  So they're going, OK, you want to win a fight?
[00:11:25.697 --> 00:11:27.378]  OK, we'll back off.
[00:11:27.678 --> 00:11:29.438]  We'll cut it by half or more.
[00:11:29.839 --> 00:11:30.399]  You win.
[00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:43.425]  Because it's very important they be able to continue adding the lead, the mercury, the uranium, the radium, and other radioactive isotopes into your water to sterilize you.
[00:11:43.445 --> 00:11:49.133]  And of course that's in the government documents and Rockefeller documents we've covered and gone over here and we've had Dr.
[00:11:52.418 --> 00:11:57.301]  Paul Conant on toxicologist, biologist, breaking all that down, PhD.
[00:11:57.321 --> 00:11:59.763]  And that video is at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:11:59.823 --> 00:12:05.567]  So these are real public service announcements that we can do and actually help people.
[00:12:07.449 --> 00:12:12.132]  Now for the next 20 minutes or so, I'm going to get into a smattering of important news.
[00:12:14.884 --> 00:12:23.015]  And then coming up at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to get into this story that I'm about to introduce in more detail.
[00:12:24.741 --> 00:12:30.567]  Headline, Witch Hunt, FBI Visiting Conservative Bloggers After Tucson Shootings.
[00:12:30.627 --> 00:12:34.851]  This is so outrageous, I don't have words to describe how serious this is.
[00:12:35.771 --> 00:12:49.544]  And they are visiting people in multiple states, Arkansas, you name it, who said nothing threatening and ask polite questions at public events about budgets and about campaign donations.
[00:12:50.407 --> 00:13:04.557]  And remember, I played the clip yesterday of elected Democrats in Missouri and other states saying, if you say things that we say aren't true about Obama, that he's not a Christian, or that he's a Muslim, we will arrest you.
[00:13:05.918 --> 00:13:07.859]  So don't think they won't do it.
[00:13:08.259 --> 00:13:10.641]  Just like you didn't believe they'd confiscate guns in Katrina.
[00:13:11.581 --> 00:13:15.405]  From even the high and dry, wealthy areas where they had generators and food.
[00:13:15.805 --> 00:13:21.090]  Their first target wasn't bring food and water to the people at the Astrodome that they blocked from leaving the city.
[00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:23.352]  They wouldn't let them go out over the highways.
[00:13:24.012 --> 00:13:25.234]  They shot them if they tried to leave.
[00:13:26.055 --> 00:13:29.778]  The cops that followed orders by the feds, by the way, were hung out to dry and put in prison for that.
[00:13:30.159 --> 00:13:31.240]  So that's a good lesson for you.
[00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:42.729]  No, they sent the military out under FBI command with police from all over the country in a giant orgy of tyranny, violating the Bill of Rights, and they took the guns.
[00:13:44.017 --> 00:13:45.179]  All the guns will be taken.
[00:13:45.479 --> 00:13:47.262]  No one will be allowed to be armed.
[00:13:47.542 --> 00:13:55.032]  And then we saw the videos of police dragging out the burglar bars on banks and on
[00:13:57.349 --> 00:14:11.116]  Haunt shops stealing the jewelry, police robbing in mass, actually kicking looters out of Walmart, but still had electrical power, still had everything, the surveillance cameras were rolling, and then the cops just start loading Sony Playstations up.
[00:14:11.456 --> 00:14:13.337]  It was a celebration of evil.
[00:14:13.977 --> 00:14:24.202]  That's what you have to look forward to when there's a blizzard in New York, the government people party and sit on their butts as little babies die on freezing mall floors for nine hours.
[00:14:25.899 --> 00:14:29.521]  When there's a Katrina, they're coming for your guns and they keep them and sell them for themselves.
[00:14:30.001 --> 00:14:31.962]  And they go in Walmart and they rob the banks.
[00:14:33.483 --> 00:14:38.226]  Every time there's a crisis in history, armies and police loot and steal.
[00:14:38.766 --> 00:14:43.789]  Oh sure, 60, 70, 80% of the cops just go, I'm not going to be part of this and go home.
[00:14:44.809 --> 00:14:48.331]  But the lawless 30% rob and rape and kill.
[00:14:48.411 --> 00:14:51.053]  And we now know robbing, raping, killing.
[00:14:51.533 --> 00:14:55.135]  The real looters were the police and military in Katrina.
[00:14:56.730 --> 00:15:04.354]  On record, I had witnesses on who were there when the cops were shooting people on the bridge and listeners couldn't believe it and later they were convicted of it.
[00:15:04.954 --> 00:15:15.138]  I had listeners on who were part of the relief effort that said the military demanded to see women's breasts in privates for water and if they wanted to be taken out they had to go behind the building and have sex with them.
[00:15:17.648 --> 00:15:23.574]  Our military's got a lot of good people, but it's also got a lot of gangbangers, and foreigners, and you name it, filling it up.
[00:15:23.874 --> 00:15:25.716]  And let me tell you, they're having a good time.
[00:15:25.996 --> 00:15:29.820]  And if you think the government can and will protect you, you're insane.
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.922]  It's a rotten fish, and they rot from the head up.
[00:15:33.263 --> 00:15:37.347]  Run by foreign offshore criminal banks, rotting right down towards the tail.
[00:15:37.747 --> 00:15:39.268]  And look, I'm not just picking on police.
[00:15:40.089 --> 00:15:46.334]  Every major societal study shows the general public, within 10 days, will rob and kill for food.
[00:15:46.755 --> 00:15:53.300]  Within 15 days, almost everyone, it's close to 100%, will eat man flesh.
[00:15:54.241 --> 00:15:56.203]  They will roast a baby on a spit.
[00:15:56.623 --> 00:15:59.446]  They will take your wife and gut her and eat her.
[00:16:00.714 --> 00:16:02.714]  They will take you and they will gut you.
[00:16:02.734 --> 00:16:21.119]  The general public out there, these wanting, pathetic, fake, moralizing liberals and mainline conservatives and people that are these domesticated, self-propelled stomachs will eat you within 15 days if they're not given food by the government as we go into this depression.
[00:16:22.657 --> 00:16:24.138]  And the globalists plan to never let it get to that.
[00:16:24.158 --> 00:16:41.346]  They're going to let things fall apart and then use the giant screaming mob as their battering ram to destroy the middle class and complete the United States journey into complete despotism just like Argentina, just like Nigeria, just like Romania, just like countless other countries.
[00:16:41.406 --> 00:16:47.610]  It's all being lovingly prepared and we have the IMF World Bank documents where they planned it in the third world.
[00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:49.371]  They call it the IMF riot.
[00:16:49.651 --> 00:16:52.012]  They engineer it with precision.
[00:16:53.174 --> 00:17:06.241]  And then you will beg for the SWAT teams and the military because even though they might rape your wife, at least they'll machine gun the horde running towards you to literally rob you and beat you to death.
[00:17:07.637 --> 00:17:13.139]  Remember the media saying how dare the Korean shopkeepers hold off the mobs that wanted to burn down their businesses?
[00:17:13.439 --> 00:17:15.380]  They were the bad guys in Los Angeles.
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:19.581]  You will be the bad guy if you try to defend your business or your home.
[00:17:20.181 --> 00:17:22.742]  You will be the one that's evil if you shoot looters.
[00:17:23.142 --> 00:17:30.345]  You will be the one that's evil if things break down with no food and water for 15 days and people start trying to roast you.
[00:17:32.034 --> 00:17:47.597]  Oh, and under Mao's great reorganization, even mainline Chinese books, government approved, I've even got the nightline on this from like 15 years ago on tape, somewhere around here, that they had giant pots stewing people up in them, and their favorite was children.
[00:17:47.837 --> 00:17:55.658]  Just giant pots roasting and boiling the dead, and that's what the great communist death machine fed off of.
[00:17:55.879 --> 00:17:57.679]  It was fueled by human flesh.
[00:17:58.599 --> 00:18:00.481]  Now, that's the extreme we could go to.
[00:18:00.802 --> 00:18:03.365]  And there's a lot of ugly places to go on the way to that.
[00:18:03.765 --> 00:18:06.949]  But, something different has happened here in this republic.
[00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:08.451]  We own guns.
[00:18:09.713 --> 00:18:10.994]  We own firearms.
[00:18:12.436 --> 00:18:14.058]  This republic is armed.
[00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:18.593]  And so they're not going to be able to have their Nazi Germany blood feast.
[00:18:18.873 --> 00:18:21.716]  They're not going to be able to have their Soviet blood feast.
[00:18:21.936 --> 00:18:26.320]  They're not going to be able to have their bloodthirsty orgy like Pol Pot did, funded by the U.S.
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:27.902]  government on record declassified.
[00:18:28.402 --> 00:18:30.785]  Zbigniew Brzezinski has now written two books bragging on that.
[00:18:30.805 --> 00:18:34.128]  And the same books he brags about founding Al Qaeda as well.
[00:18:35.831 --> 00:18:37.011]  Who can then menace us.
[00:18:37.271 --> 00:18:39.572]  Oh, let the government take all your rights and surveil you.
[00:18:39.612 --> 00:18:41.512]  It's to protect you from Al-Qaeda.
[00:18:41.692 --> 00:18:43.873]  It's a little sock puppet they're running and funding.
[00:18:44.453 --> 00:18:46.133]  And it's a vicious little sock puppet as well.
[00:18:46.154 --> 00:18:47.154]  It does bite.
[00:18:50.014 --> 00:18:51.035]  Oh, let us take your rights.
[00:18:51.335 --> 00:18:52.255]  This enemy's coming.
[00:18:52.455 --> 00:18:53.235]  Oh, never mind.
[00:18:53.275 --> 00:18:55.636]  Our hand is manipulating it.
[00:18:57.296 --> 00:18:59.477]  Don't look at the big globalist government over here.
[00:18:59.697 --> 00:19:02.197]  Look, look at the scary Al-Qaeda puppet.
[00:19:02.217 --> 00:19:04.338]  In fact, I've got to order online an Al-Qaeda puppet so I can
[00:19:05.458 --> 00:19:07.179]  Basically a Mr. Rogers TV here.
[00:19:07.479 --> 00:19:11.300]  Okay, see I just ranted for a whole segment because I'm so freaked out fundamentally.
[00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:14.061]  We were mourning last night in this office.
[00:19:15.821 --> 00:19:16.841]  We were mourning.
[00:19:17.622 --> 00:19:18.662]  I worked up here until about 8.30.
[00:19:19.882 --> 00:19:23.463]  We were mourning the information that we've now seen.
[00:19:23.523 --> 00:19:25.124]  We were staggered.
[00:19:25.184 --> 00:19:26.324]  We were freaked out.
[00:19:26.884 --> 00:19:28.505]  That's a normal response.
[00:19:30.949 --> 00:19:33.130]  At what unfolded, and I haven't even gotten to it yet.
[00:19:34.151 --> 00:19:35.572]  I should be speechless by this.
[00:19:36.172 --> 00:19:38.873]  But this is just the latest what you're about to hear.
[00:19:39.894 --> 00:19:44.817]  They're going to peaceful, conservative bloggers' homes and businesses and basically threatening them.
[00:19:46.378 --> 00:19:47.578]  And asking them if they're violent.
[00:19:48.439 --> 00:19:49.440]  Well, why am I freaked out?
[00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:51.841]  I've had the FBI here asking me that before.
[00:19:52.301 --> 00:19:53.102]  And the Secret Service.
[00:19:55.143 --> 00:19:56.223]  And it gets worse.
[00:19:57.541 --> 00:19:58.741]  Just wait till I break this down.
[00:19:58.761 --> 00:19:59.161]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.242 --> 00:20:02.502]  New year, new way to smoke.
[00:20:02.782 --> 00:20:03.803]  And it's Totally Wicked!
[00:20:04.083 --> 00:20:06.843]  Introducing Totally Wicked e-liquid electronic cigarettes.

[00:20:55.615 --> 00:20:57.817]  The next generation of alternative smoking.
[00:21:00.441 --> 00:21:01.281]  Gold isn't for you?
[00:21:01.461 --> 00:21:06.802]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[00:21:06.982 --> 00:21:07.402]  I get it.
[00:21:07.522 --> 00:21:16.844]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[00:21:17.144 --> 00:21:18.345]  That's not what's happening.
[00:21:18.545 --> 00:21:26.806]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[00:21:27.026 --> 00:21:30.267]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[00:21:30.407 --> 00:21:34.490]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[00:21:34.671 --> 00:21:36.252]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[00:21:36.272 --> 00:21:39.515]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[00:21:40.235 --> 00:21:43.858]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[00:21:44.058 --> 00:21:44.779]  You should, too.
[00:21:44.959 --> 00:21:45.940]  Find out what they know.
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:49.463]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[00:21:49.483 --> 00:21:49.723]  800-686-2237.
[00:21:49.743 --> 00:21:49.783]  800-686-2237.
[00:21:49.823 --> 00:21:50.003]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:21:59.662 --> 00:22:01.984]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:22:02.064 --> 00:22:04.245]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:22:04.265 --> 00:22:07.147]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:22:07.487 --> 00:22:12.330]  The Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:16.893]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:22:17.193 --> 00:22:19.554]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:22:19.654 --> 00:22:22.055]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:22:22.075 --> 00:22:24.996]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:22:25.337 --> 00:22:32.940]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:38.524]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:22:38.544 --> 00:22:41.426]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:22:41.526 --> 00:22:44.969]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:22:45.209 --> 00:22:46.129]  And I got news for you.
[00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:47.591]  You're everyone else.
[00:22:47.631 --> 00:22:48.731]  Invisible Empire.

[00:23:00.759 --> 00:23:01.879]  This is not a drill.
[00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:03.960]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[00:23:04.481 --> 00:23:06.081]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[00:23:06.381 --> 00:23:13.504]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[00:23:13.604 --> 00:23:17.946]  Now a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[00:23:17.986 --> 00:23:28.331]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them, how to create the perfect hiding place, as well as the places you should never hide your guns.
[00:23:28.991 --> 00:23:30.052]  Any circumstance.
[00:23:30.132 --> 00:23:37.015]  These and other closely guarded gun caching secrets are guaranteed to keep your weapons safe and out of sight when the going gets tough.
[00:23:37.355 --> 00:23:38.015]  But listen up.
[00:23:38.035 --> 00:23:44.238]  For security reasons, the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time.
[00:23:44.298 --> 00:23:46.099]  Go to hideyourguns.com.
[00:23:46.139 --> 00:23:48.220]  That's hideyourguns.com.
[00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:48.780]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:50.641]  Before they come for your guns.
[00:23:50.681 --> 00:23:51.882]  Hideyourguns.com right now.
[00:24:15.982 --> 00:24:19.224]  A political police force has been set up in America.
[00:24:20.144 --> 00:24:29.189]  From before the time that Obama was elected, it was his destiny to carry the ball of the New World Order down the field until a new puppet came in.
[00:24:29.869 --> 00:24:31.770]  So understand, this isn't just coming from Obama.
[00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:34.611]  This is the offshore banking cartel's agenda.
[00:24:34.972 --> 00:24:39.054]  They've engaged in all this looting and all this, you know, criminal takeovers of society.
[00:24:40.114 --> 00:24:44.917]  They've got to have a rearguard action now to protect themselves as they run off with all the loot.
[00:24:45.797 --> 00:24:46.937]  From the crimes they've committed.
[00:24:46.977 --> 00:24:49.979]  I mean, they've been steering a giant empire for their own gain.
[00:24:50.319 --> 00:24:51.799]  They've got to continue that fraud.
[00:24:52.700 --> 00:25:06.324]  And so now, all over the country, Arkansas and other states, the FBI is visiting mainline peaceful bloggers who have asked questions about campaign contributions of congressmen and people, and they're asking them, are you violent?
[00:25:06.745 --> 00:25:13.127]  So, not only has it been proven to be a hoax that this shooter in Tucson, Arizona, was a conservative,
[00:25:14.105 --> 00:25:17.392]  That's been proven to be a total hoax now, on record.
[00:25:17.452 --> 00:25:18.734]  If anything, he was a leftist.
[00:25:19.355 --> 00:25:20.998]  That was all his major affiliations.
[00:25:23.837 --> 00:25:31.965]  That doesn't stop the FBI, and it doesn't stop local media around the country from reporting on how it's a good thing to have the FBI visit bloggers.
[00:25:32.446 --> 00:25:43.798]  After all, they're the mainstream media, and they don't like that those bloggers have bigger audiences in many cases than they do, and why they're teamed up with the government to check into this, because, you know, free speech might be terrorism.
[00:25:44.158 --> 00:25:54.485]  So you're seeing the conversion now from, oh, this whole police state's for the foreign Muslims, to, oh, it's for the returning veterans and gun owners, and, oh, bloggers, and there's white Al-Qaeda everywhere.
[00:25:54.905 --> 00:25:55.906]  And that's the big article.
[00:25:55.946 --> 00:26:00.028]  We have the videos up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:26:00.048 --> 00:26:01.710]  Get it out to everybody out there.
[00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:04.311]  I think this is Drudge Report material.
[00:26:05.132 --> 00:26:05.692]  Witch Hunt!
[00:26:06.232 --> 00:26:10.896]  FBI visiting conservative bloggers after Tucson shootings.
[00:26:11.776 --> 00:26:15.778]  And here they are with a straight face in Arkansas talking about it.
[00:26:15.798 --> 00:26:16.958]  I'm not going to play the whole newscast.
[00:26:16.978 --> 00:26:19.119]  If you want to see it, it's up on Infowars.com.
[00:26:19.299 --> 00:26:19.759]  Here it is.
[00:26:20.879 --> 00:26:26.501]  An Ozark man says he's far from public enemy number one, but he felt like it earlier this week.
[00:26:26.802 --> 00:26:32.163]  He was interviewed by the FBI because he's considered a threat to a newly elected politician.
[00:26:32.644 --> 00:26:35.645]  KSPR's Joanna Small joins us now live with more details.
[00:26:35.825 --> 00:26:36.125]  Joanna.
[00:26:36.806 --> 00:26:43.868]  Lee, congressmen and women, senators and politicians across the United States are pinpointing people they say could pose a threat to their safety.
[00:26:44.348 --> 00:26:50.410]  This in light of the assassination attempt on Gabrielle Giffords that landed her in critical condition and six people dead.
[00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:53.491]  Still, this local man says he's no Jared Lochner.
[00:26:56.872 --> 00:26:59.293]  Clay Bowler says you're watching the worst of it.
[00:26:59.353 --> 00:27:03.034]  Billy, on November 23rd, you made a $1,000 donation to Roy Blunt.
[00:27:03.074 --> 00:27:06.455]  Were you fed up with federal spending before or after you made that donation?
[00:27:06.475 --> 00:27:12.977]  He claims these were the most confrontational encounters he ever had with then-candidate, now-Congressman, Billy Long.
[00:27:12.997 --> 00:27:13.657]  Okay, that's enough.
[00:27:13.677 --> 00:27:15.118]  I've never threatened Billy Long.
[00:27:15.158 --> 00:27:15.398]  Never.
[00:27:15.438 --> 00:27:18.979]  Notice how they put it off on him like he's got to explain himself.
[00:27:19.499 --> 00:27:26.061]  He goes out to a campaign event, follows the guy along with the rest of the press, and points out that the guy isn't really a conservative.
[00:27:27.199 --> 00:27:29.981]  And is giving money to candidates that are for big government.
[00:27:30.221 --> 00:27:31.822]  I mean, that's real journalism.
[00:27:32.303 --> 00:27:33.684]  And he gets an FBI visit.
[00:27:33.944 --> 00:27:36.165]  This is an attempt at intimidation.
[00:27:37.626 --> 00:27:47.633]  Now, on top of all of this, yesterday, Jason Douglas made some unbelievable discoveries.
[00:27:48.814 --> 00:27:49.915]  And he wrote two stories.
[00:27:51.455 --> 00:27:54.336]  on this subject for InfoWars.com.
[00:27:54.776 --> 00:27:56.356]  One is Stop, Think, Connect.
[00:27:56.737 --> 00:27:59.057]  DHS announces new fear agenda.
[00:28:00.137 --> 00:28:11.240]  The other story deals with citizens being trained that people buying guns and engaged in political speech may be terrorists.
[00:28:11.781 --> 00:28:16.422]  And we have the Department of Homeland Security FEMA Ready Kids
[00:28:17.609 --> 00:28:18.530]  I don't think so.
[00:28:39.918 --> 00:28:44.499]  I was in a Best Buy a few days ago to buy some DVDs, because I like to watch movies when I jog on the treadmill.
[00:28:44.959 --> 00:29:00.242]  And I was dressed nice, and I went in, and they had a plainclothes security guard kind of follow me around, and I'd look down to see what movies were there, and he'd come and stand by me, and I started getting a little irritated, and I was looking at him, and then he wouldn't make eye contact, but then I just said, I'm not going to get mad, I'm going to get out of here.
[00:29:00.662 --> 00:29:05.683]  But then I saw him kind of follow me, and then they kind of said something, and I went up with like five videos.
[00:29:06.423 --> 00:29:08.605]  And I bought them, and the woman said, let me see your driver's license.
[00:29:08.625 --> 00:29:10.846]  Let me see your ID.
[00:29:10.866 --> 00:29:13.228]  I mean, your credit card.
[00:29:13.248 --> 00:29:15.490]  Because I was paying with a credit card.
[00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:18.412]  And I just said, look, this is like an airport now.
[00:29:18.432 --> 00:29:20.073]  I'm never going to come in Best Buy again.
[00:29:20.093 --> 00:29:24.637]  And then the guy wanted to search me in my little bag when I left with my five movies.
[00:29:25.216 --> 00:29:26.357]  And they were doing it to everybody else.
[00:29:26.457 --> 00:29:31.120]  It's just like, you're a slave, you're a scum, you're bad, and everybody's a secret police agent.
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:39.564]  But continuing here, it says, buying guns or ammunition is now a sign of terrorism.
[00:29:40.285 --> 00:29:44.928]  And it says, political speech is controversial issues being debated.
[00:29:45.208 --> 00:29:47.649]  Go ahead and call Homeland Security on your neighbors for that.
[00:29:47.969 --> 00:29:49.470]  This is what kids are being trained to do.
[00:29:50.311 --> 00:29:51.251]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.712 --> 00:29:53.213]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.211 --> 00:29:56.927]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.014 --> 00:30:03.496]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[00:30:03.856 --> 00:30:07.899]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[00:30:08.139 --> 00:30:13.182]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[00:30:13.282 --> 00:30:18.045]  Not looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[00:30:18.786 --> 00:30:25.890]  Not worried about them moving south, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[00:30:28.559 --> 00:30:32.962]  I'm looking for America.
[00:30:34.223 --> 00:30:35.383]  We're American and be proud.
[00:30:35.403 --> 00:30:37.825]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[00:30:37.885 --> 00:30:42.508]  Land of the free and the home of the brave.
[00:30:42.948 --> 00:30:46.590]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[00:30:54.514 --> 00:30:59.180]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[00:30:59.741 --> 00:31:03.967]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[00:31:04.287 --> 00:31:08.373]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:31:08.633 --> 00:31:09.114]  Number two,
[00:31:09.474 --> 00:31:14.036]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:31:14.376 --> 00:31:14.816]  It's true.
[00:31:15.116 --> 00:31:20.538]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:31:20.818 --> 00:31:24.099]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:31:24.399 --> 00:31:28.881]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:31:29.101 --> 00:31:31.482]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:31:31.862 --> 00:31:35.203]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:31:35.543 --> 00:31:40.244]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:31:40.464 --> 00:31:45.245]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:31:45.526 --> 00:31:49.547]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:49.707 --> 00:31:51.267]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:51.487 --> 00:31:56.088]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:32:00.489 --> 00:32:14.962]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:32:15.963 --> 00:32:19.646]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:20.652 --> 00:32:32.643]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:32:33.404 --> 00:32:40.670]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:32:41.371 --> 00:32:50.963]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:32:51.744 --> 00:32:55.008]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:32:55.669 --> 00:32:58.773]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[00:33:03.089 --> 00:33:03.810]  Big Brother.
[00:33:04.071 --> 00:33:05.353]  Mainstream media.
[00:33:05.734 --> 00:33:06.936]  Government cover-ups.
[00:33:07.136 --> 00:33:08.117]  You want answers?
[00:33:08.398 --> 00:33:09.480]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:10.481 --> 00:33:14.368]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:18.777 --> 00:33:37.206]  Okay, so now we learn that in different areas of the country, Homeland Security is visiting conservative bloggers' homes and businesses and asking them if they're planning to attack members of Congress and others if they simply ask questions politely.
[00:33:38.649 --> 00:33:41.611]  And the message is, you sit down, you shut up.
[00:33:42.111 --> 00:33:46.854]  You don't do that or we're basically going to come out and say that you're a terrorist.
[00:33:47.394 --> 00:33:58.860]  Now on top of this, you know at the 9,000 locations, malls, shopping centers, grocery stores, 845 plus Walmarts that they're putting in, in some cases,
[00:33:59.901 --> 00:34:02.927]  Dozens and dozens of telescreens at every checkout counter.
[00:34:03.127 --> 00:34:11.964]  They have a telescreen telling you to basically spy on other people that are shopping, watch your neighbors, and of course we knew that there would be new announcements.
[00:34:12.844 --> 00:34:17.367]  And they have like an AP news scroll on the bottom to make it newsy.
[00:34:17.868 --> 00:34:20.830]  They now have a new report saying the Internet is under threat.
[00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:23.051]  Watch the websites you visit.
[00:34:23.352 --> 00:34:23.912]  Don't worry.
[00:34:24.232 --> 00:34:25.693]  This is Cybersecurity Month.
[00:34:26.414 --> 00:34:31.658]  Homeland Security is going to be taking over the Internet for your safety.
[00:34:32.543 --> 00:34:35.305]  And then you read the architecture of the Cybersecurity Act.
[00:34:36.085 --> 00:34:56.017]  It basically admits that they're going to hack up the web as we know it, have internet ID trackers, the president's announced that, that they are going to start taxing it, and that they're going to make you serve under National Compulsory Service, that's the domestic security force, just as big and just as strong as our military.
[00:34:56.497 --> 00:35:00.740]  That's a TSA run, Homeland Security Amalgamation,
[00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:05.902]  You notice the Congress is saying they want TSA as their security now on the streets.
[00:35:06.382 --> 00:35:10.263]  Their own little private federal goon force on top of Secret Service.
[00:35:10.584 --> 00:35:11.624]  Well, it's the same thing here.
[00:35:12.024 --> 00:35:21.348]  Now this new cyber security making youth go into government training programs in high school to fight propaganda on the web.
[00:35:22.088 --> 00:35:28.979]  That is going out and countering you and I that are speaking out against him while the FBI visits us and harasses us.
[00:35:29.039 --> 00:35:31.523]  I mean, this is the authoritarian police state.
[00:35:32.403 --> 00:35:34.144]  Take over of the web.
[00:35:34.685 --> 00:35:37.868]  And here it is out of Oklahoma in partnership with Homeland Security.
[00:35:38.508 --> 00:35:45.054]  This is OK.gov forward slash red dirt ready, which of course is the name of the FEMA Homeland Security program.
[00:35:45.954 --> 00:35:46.775]  Ready dot gov.
[00:35:47.415 --> 00:35:50.338]  And it says, do you have binoculars?
[00:35:51.299 --> 00:35:53.100]  Are you taking photographs or videos?
[00:35:54.281 --> 00:35:56.523]  Individuals avoiding eye contact.
[00:35:57.404 --> 00:35:58.445]  It continues here.
[00:36:00.131 --> 00:36:09.562]  It says that if you are at a hotel and that if you order room service but don't want them inside your room,
[00:36:10.592 --> 00:36:19.239]  I mean, just a few weeks ago I was with my wife and children in a hotel, and they were all in their pajamas, and we ordered some food at about 9 at night.
[00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:23.523]  We were going to watch TV, something we rarely do, a treat for the kids.
[00:36:24.384 --> 00:36:26.766]  And we'd already ordered room service at about 7.
[00:36:27.026 --> 00:36:29.789]  We were going to let them have some desserts because we were on vacation, that's right.
[00:36:30.049 --> 00:36:33.192]  So some ice cream and milk and stuff was coming up.
[00:36:33.872 --> 00:36:38.617]  And I was wearing a shirt and shorts, but my wife was in her nightgown and she said, don't let him in.
[00:36:38.897 --> 00:36:41.500]  And so I went over and went outside and signed it.
[00:36:41.961 --> 00:36:44.563]  It says, go ahead and call Homeland Security if you do that.
[00:36:44.964 --> 00:36:46.225]  So again, I'm a terrorist as well.
[00:36:46.605 --> 00:36:50.489]  All of this is a net so wide that see everyone is guilty.
[00:36:50.609 --> 00:36:51.610]  Everyone is suspect.
[00:36:51.811 --> 00:36:53.913]  The terrorists are hiding under the table.
[00:36:54.073 --> 00:36:55.833]  They're hiding in the pantry.
[00:36:55.993 --> 00:36:58.594]  They're hiding in the basement, in the attic, in the bushes.
[00:36:59.134 --> 00:37:01.554]  Only Homeland Security will keep you safe.
[00:37:01.774 --> 00:37:04.155]  It's all about this total climate of fear.
[00:37:04.875 --> 00:37:06.815]  This total climate of fear.
[00:37:06.835 --> 00:37:13.116]  I mean, there's this new video where Homeland Security is announcing, and now 9,000 locations these are being put in.
[00:37:13.136 --> 00:37:17.097]  And they're now announcing they're going to put them on highways and in public squares.
[00:37:17.137 --> 00:37:18.317]  Just big announcements.
[00:37:18.637 --> 00:37:21.158]  And they said, don't worry, we want the public involved.
[00:37:22.273 --> 00:37:23.114]  In the new program.
[00:37:23.835 --> 00:37:34.505]  And so we're going to have cash prizes for people that produce PSAs about internet danger and how bad the internet is.
[00:37:34.565 --> 00:37:35.465]  And don't trust anyone.
[00:37:35.666 --> 00:37:36.707]  Don't trust your neighbors.
[00:37:36.907 --> 00:37:37.828]  Don't trust the internet.
[00:37:38.088 --> 00:37:42.112]  Only trust the government run by bankers that are stealing your pension funds right now.
[00:37:44.258 --> 00:37:48.343]  I mean, they're really getting gearing up for the full announcement we're in a depression.
[00:37:48.643 --> 00:37:50.385]  They're just stalling, saying the economy's great.
[00:37:50.685 --> 00:37:55.331]  Don't worry, record job losses, record housing price slumps, dollar evaluation, shut up.
[00:37:55.771 --> 00:38:00.176]  Look, the terrorist that shot the Congresswoman, he didn't like the Federal Reserve.
[00:38:00.837 --> 00:38:03.260]  Don't talk bad about the Federal Reserve, you're a terrorist!
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:04.701]  FBI's gonna visit you!
[00:38:07.045 --> 00:38:08.666]  And they're just creating this hysteria.
[00:38:08.706 --> 00:38:11.507]  So it says, go ahead and call Homeland Security.
[00:38:11.527 --> 00:38:13.428]  This is being given to school children in Oklahoma.
[00:38:14.188 --> 00:38:19.391]  If you hear controversial issues being debated, and they're telling us now what controversial issues are.
[00:38:20.491 --> 00:38:22.372]  Are you talking about the monetary system?
[00:38:23.233 --> 00:38:26.914]  Little people aren't supposed to be talking about those high and mighty things.
[00:38:26.954 --> 00:38:28.915]  You just let the bankers run things.
[00:38:29.295 --> 00:38:31.616]  They'll take care of it like they've done all over the world.
[00:38:32.037 --> 00:38:34.338]  They're nice men in suits.
[00:38:35.523 --> 00:38:37.064]  Like Mr. Madoff and Ken Lay.
[00:38:38.524 --> 00:38:43.507]  Mr. Bernanke's going to take... Now never mind that Congress asked where the trillions went and they won't say.
[00:38:44.147 --> 00:38:45.968]  Nothing to see here, move along.
[00:38:46.328 --> 00:38:48.329]  You don't want an FBI visit, do you?
[00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:53.752]  You don't want to be on a no-fly or no-work or no-gun-by list, no judge or jury.
[00:38:54.032 --> 00:38:57.313]  You better sit down and shut up and everything will be okay.
[00:38:57.574 --> 00:39:00.075]  Because together we thrive.
[00:39:02.216 --> 00:39:06.080]  Meaning, sit down and shut up and do what the television and Barack Obama tells you.
[00:39:07.161 --> 00:39:11.945]  The message is, you criticize government and corruption, you're going to get an FBI visit.
[00:39:12.206 --> 00:39:14.048]  You sit down and shut up, you're going to thrive.
[00:39:15.229 --> 00:39:18.452]  All these Obama supporters for two years thought they were going to get free houses, free cars.
[00:39:18.692 --> 00:39:20.914]  Oh, thank you, Mr. President, I don't have to have a job anymore.
[00:39:21.114 --> 00:39:22.035]  I'm going to get free healthcare.
[00:39:22.215 --> 00:39:23.096]  Did you get that?
[00:39:24.093 --> 00:39:37.063]  Turns out it allows the government to cut the quality of care for everybody and to set up death panels and not give old people treatment and to force 30 plus million people to buy overpriced insurance because the insurance companies wrote it.
[00:39:37.884 --> 00:39:40.486]  Do you suckers that are born every minute like what happened?
[00:39:41.026 --> 00:39:47.131]  I'm talking to those mainline idiot liberals that think we're going to be safer like you are in Chicago and New York if we disarm the public.
[00:39:48.848 --> 00:39:56.107]  Then you could have a total crime-ridden system run by crooks on top and government with their little buddies, the crooks on bottom, feeding on everybody.
[00:39:56.127 --> 00:39:56.669]  You like that?
[00:39:58.476 --> 00:40:07.541]  So this is all so over the top now, and we've got a big video that I shot last night that Rob Deuce stayed up all night to get up.
[00:40:07.601 --> 00:40:09.642]  It's on the InfoWarrior channel.
[00:40:09.682 --> 00:40:11.683]  It's the top video at the Alex Jones video channel.
[00:40:11.883 --> 00:40:21.169]  We're getting it posted right now at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and it's got the headline
[00:40:22.289 --> 00:40:23.270]  I don't know.
[00:40:42.821 --> 00:40:43.082]  I don't
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:03.262]  Then again, Jason Douglas has two other articles that went up last night.
[00:41:03.723 --> 00:41:08.186]  Oklahoma Homeland Security says controversial debate, suspicious behavior.
[00:41:08.446 --> 00:41:10.087]  And they're telling us what's controversial.
[00:41:10.547 --> 00:41:12.529]  You don't talk about government corruption.
[00:41:12.849 --> 00:41:14.450]  You don't talk about the Federal Reserve.
[00:41:14.650 --> 00:41:16.472]  You don't talk about monetary issues.
[00:41:16.892 --> 00:41:19.214]  You don't talk about crooks in government.
[00:41:19.614 --> 00:41:21.996]  You sit down and you shut up.
[00:41:23.036 --> 00:41:24.878]  And if we sit down and shut up,
[00:41:26.036 --> 00:41:32.679]  See, they know the general public's being conditioned just to accept tyranny, but this is also a message to those of the people that are awake and about to get involved.
[00:41:32.719 --> 00:41:35.520]  It's like, you don't want men in black uniforms to come!
[00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:45.624]  See, that's why so many people that watch my show, listen to my radio show, watch it streaming at PrisonPlanet.tv, they can't believe I'm real, even though all the fruits of what we've done.
[00:41:45.924 --> 00:41:49.005]  They can't believe someone's bold, someone has courage, someone...
[00:41:50.109 --> 00:41:58.733]  is announcing a contest against the government contest where they're saying make contest about not trusting other citizens, not trusting the internet.
[00:41:59.233 --> 00:42:04.555]  I'm going to have a contest exposing the TSA rollout of the telescreens brainwashing people.
[00:42:04.815 --> 00:42:06.576]  I mean, I'm there engaging them.
[00:42:06.776 --> 00:42:12.639]  I'm on the field as an example confronting these people at point-blank range in the info war.
[00:42:13.576 --> 00:42:15.058]  Okay, I've been physically attacked.
[00:42:15.318 --> 00:42:16.179]  I'm demonized.
[00:42:17.621 --> 00:42:21.905]  George Soros publications say I will be responsible for the next Oklahoma City.
[00:42:22.786 --> 00:42:26.951]  We have been sent the secret army documents where the army is surveilling yours truly.
[00:42:27.271 --> 00:42:29.233]  I am surveilled by the U.S.
[00:42:29.473 --> 00:42:29.694]  Army.
[00:42:30.274 --> 00:42:33.056]  Okay, because we're hardcore, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:33.276 --> 00:42:35.198]  We are real defenders of the Republic.
[00:42:35.498 --> 00:42:39.962]  We are picking up the mantle of those that fought in 1776 against tyranny.
[00:42:40.202 --> 00:42:41.723]  We are the real Americans.
[00:42:41.943 --> 00:42:43.764]  We are the red-blooded Americans.
[00:42:43.804 --> 00:42:47.347]  We are the red, white, and blue, regardless of what color or religion.
[00:42:47.387 --> 00:42:49.769]  If you love liberty, you're a red-blooded American.
[00:42:50.229 --> 00:42:55.914]  And so we're the enemies of these foreign banking usurpers that are butchering our country!
[00:42:57.830 --> 00:42:59.692]  I mean, what more does it take?
[00:43:00.193 --> 00:43:02.256]  1984 telescreens saying don't trust your neighbors?
[00:43:02.276 --> 00:43:03.497]  1984 messages?
[00:43:03.617 --> 00:43:05.940]  And they're going to get more and more crazy.
[00:43:06.081 --> 00:43:12.849]  They're going to be airing, in the 9,000 locations, citizen-made propaganda and corporate-made propaganda.
[00:43:13.710 --> 00:43:15.251]  About how dangerous the internet is.
[00:43:15.491 --> 00:43:20.073]  This is their propaganda push to force their way in to take over the web.
[00:43:20.373 --> 00:43:21.153]  They've announced it.
[00:43:21.353 --> 00:43:22.814]  PC World yesterday.
[00:43:23.354 --> 00:43:25.695]  We told you a year ago, but it's PC World yesterday.
[00:43:26.035 --> 00:43:28.076]  Internet ID program to be implemented.
[00:43:28.316 --> 00:43:29.036]  It's been announced.
[00:43:29.456 --> 00:43:32.397]  All the new Microsoft operating systems already have it built into them.
[00:43:32.718 --> 00:43:34.698]  You'll have to thumbprint to get online.
[00:43:35.219 --> 00:43:37.379]  They're moving at warp speed!
[00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:39.160]  It's real!
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:41.341]  Now, here's an even better development.
[00:43:43.492 --> 00:43:45.094]  If we give in to the intimidation, they win.
[00:43:45.614 --> 00:43:50.158]  It means total enslavement if we don't buck up and say, you know what, I'm not intimidated by you.
[00:43:50.478 --> 00:43:52.480]  Just like when a bully starts a fight with you.
[00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:53.841]  This is a political bully.
[00:43:54.081 --> 00:43:55.242]  We're not calling for violence.
[00:43:56.143 --> 00:44:08.193]  We're calling to stand up to these violent people in this violent state with its violent propaganda and its IRS that comes with guns if you don't pay all the money they claim you're owed and the property taxes.
[00:44:08.253 --> 00:44:09.354]  They will come with a gun.
[00:44:09.494 --> 00:44:10.374]  They will kill you.
[00:44:11.195 --> 00:44:12.977]  If you resist when they try to take your house.
[00:44:13.317 --> 00:44:14.418]  They are the violent ones.
[00:44:14.559 --> 00:44:16.300]  They're trying to make you think you're the violent ones.
[00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:17.241]  You're the bad ones.
[00:44:17.261 --> 00:44:21.045]  They're teaching you that political discussion is evil.
[00:44:22.987 --> 00:44:24.629]  They're bringing in classical tyranny.
[00:44:24.909 --> 00:44:28.132]  And they're counting on us not standing up and saying no to them right now.
[00:44:28.412 --> 00:44:30.795]  Now, I want to get into this.
[00:44:34.090 --> 00:44:37.092]  They are making the case, and I'm going to make the case 110%.
[00:44:38.413 --> 00:44:52.521]  I will absolutely prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that Rachel Maddow, America's favorite Boy Scout, I am going to absolutely make the 110% case that they are the un-American enemies of the Republic.
[00:44:53.101 --> 00:44:58.487]  They are the children of the authoritarian past.
[00:44:59.128 --> 00:45:05.896]  And we are the children of the renaissance, of liberty, of the enlightenment, of the awakening, of the flower of freedom, 1776.
[00:45:06.156 --> 00:45:07.477]  We are the children of liberty.
[00:45:07.958 --> 00:45:09.319]  They are the children of tyranny.
[00:45:12.563 --> 00:45:13.424]  Okay, it's that simple.
[00:45:13.704 --> 00:45:16.207]  And I will prove it, now, incontrovertible.
[00:45:16.507 --> 00:45:30.683]  Let's go ahead and play a clip of Rachel Maddow demonizing Congressman Brown, who's been on, Congressman Paul, and myself, implying that we are calling for violence, and that we are going to carry out violence, and then she says that, you know, it's un-American.
[00:45:31.123 --> 00:45:34.026]  I have the Declaration of Independence right here.
[00:45:34.969 --> 00:45:36.110]  This is America.
[00:45:36.690 --> 00:45:37.671]  More than the Bill of Rights.
[00:45:37.731 --> 00:45:38.811]  More than the Constitution.
[00:45:39.152 --> 00:45:39.892]  This is it.
[00:45:40.653 --> 00:45:45.976]  This was when some of the most powerful men that had a lot to lose put their names, their lives, their treasure.
[00:45:46.136 --> 00:45:47.077]  A lot of them got killed.
[00:45:47.097 --> 00:45:50.639]  A lot of their families and children got killed when they put their name on this.
[00:45:50.879 --> 00:45:52.440]  When they signed their John Hancock.
[00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:54.561]  This is America.
[00:45:54.881 --> 00:45:55.442]  If you don't
[00:45:56.425 --> 00:45:57.265]  Stand for this.
[00:45:57.425 --> 00:46:01.287]  If you don't kiss the ring of this, you're not an American.
[00:46:01.827 --> 00:46:02.447]  This is it.
[00:46:02.707 --> 00:46:04.088]  Nothing is more Americana.
[00:46:04.308 --> 00:46:06.109]  It ain't apple pie and baseball, folks.
[00:46:06.609 --> 00:46:08.270]  It ain't Chevy cars, okay?
[00:46:08.730 --> 00:46:10.110]  That's the fruit of liberty.
[00:46:10.911 --> 00:46:12.011]  This is the root.
[00:46:12.631 --> 00:46:13.492]  This is the root.
[00:46:14.032 --> 00:46:16.393]  The liberty and the wealth is the fruit.
[00:46:17.307 --> 00:46:18.168]  This is the root!
[00:46:18.348 --> 00:46:19.710]  This is putting it on the table!
[00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:22.573]  This is saying, you're tyrants and I'm calling you out!
[00:46:23.094 --> 00:46:26.517]  When they were sending trained murderers to kill these men!
[00:46:28.099 --> 00:46:29.361]  Burning down their farms!
[00:46:30.262 --> 00:46:31.843]  This is the root of liberty!
[00:46:32.044 --> 00:46:32.985]  And what does it say here?
[00:46:36.004 --> 00:46:52.190]  But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invigorably the same object, invents a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such a government and to provide new guards for their future security.
[00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:53.691]  It is not our right!
[00:46:54.705 --> 00:46:57.987]  It is our duty to throw off this tyrannical government.
[00:46:58.147 --> 00:46:59.468]  But we are the government.
[00:46:59.508 --> 00:47:00.929]  We created this government.
[00:47:01.269 --> 00:47:07.372]  And so we have a right to get in the face of these crooks, and to get angry, and to get focused, and to rile people up.
[00:47:07.412 --> 00:47:13.335]  That's how you get things done, in the face of tyranny, to take our republic back through the states, through the Congress.
[00:47:13.796 --> 00:47:15.076]  But they're not going to let that happen.
[00:47:15.096 --> 00:47:17.578]  They're going to blow up new Oklahoma cities and blame it on us.
[00:47:17.918 --> 00:47:20.540]  They've got the talking points out saying they're going to do it.
[00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:22.521]  Even Glenn Beck has to admit that.
[00:47:22.541 --> 00:47:24.943]  It isn't going to work.
[00:47:25.243 --> 00:47:28.786]  We've got to have courage in the face of these criminals or there is no future.
[00:47:29.367 --> 00:47:30.728]  Now, let's go ahead now.
[00:47:31.148 --> 00:47:35.371]  Here she is demonizing Ron Paul, Congressman Brown, myself, Rachel Maddow.
[00:47:37.774 --> 00:47:41.596]  I think she's one of the most well-spoken men on MSNBC.
[00:47:41.916 --> 00:47:50.982]  Let's go ahead and play this clip of Rachel, Mr. Maddow, last night going after Ron Paul, you name it, here it is.
[00:47:52.622 --> 00:48:01.107]  Fellow patriots, we have a lot of domestic enemies of the Constitution, and they're right down the mall in the Congress of the United States.
[00:48:01.127 --> 00:48:03.989]  That's Paul Brown, representative.
[00:48:05.464 --> 00:48:08.546]  And right down Independence Avenue in the White House.
[00:48:09.247 --> 00:48:10.188]  They can't stand us!
[00:48:10.408 --> 00:48:11.008]  We're calling them out!
[00:48:11.028 --> 00:48:15.091]  It's not about my ability to hunt, which I love to do.
[00:48:15.812 --> 00:48:24.679]  It's not about the ability for me to protect my family and my property against criminals, which we have the right to do.
[00:48:26.087 --> 00:48:32.991]  But it's all about us protecting ourselves from a tyrannical government of the United States.
[00:48:33.271 --> 00:48:34.472]  That's America right there.
[00:48:34.512 --> 00:48:35.252]  That's an American.
[00:48:35.272 --> 00:48:37.574]  Second Amendment not about hunting or self-defense.
[00:48:37.654 --> 00:48:42.536]  It's about citizens having the ability to overthrow the tyrannical government of the United States.
[00:48:42.556 --> 00:48:45.338]  That was Congressman Paul Brown of Georgia speaking last April.
[00:48:45.718 --> 00:48:45.858]  E.J.
[00:48:45.999 --> 00:48:48.021]  Dionne wrote about this at the Washington Post today.
[00:48:48.522 --> 00:48:55.050]  He found Republican Congressman Ron Paul making roughly the same argument in print five years ago, quoting Mr. Paul, quote,
[00:49:03.982 --> 00:49:08.485]  The founders knew that unarmed citizens would never be able to overthrow a tyrannical government as they did.
[00:49:09.086 --> 00:49:13.489]  The muskets they used against the British Army were the assault rifles of that time.
[00:49:13.849 --> 00:49:17.572]  Again, the argument here is that the Second Amendment exists so Americans can overthrow the government.
[00:49:18.653 --> 00:49:19.253]  That is a view.
[00:49:19.714 --> 00:49:21.835]  It is a radical view of gun policy.
[00:49:22.876 --> 00:49:23.657]  Back it up a little bit.
[00:49:23.877 --> 00:49:24.837]  No, it's not a view.
[00:49:25.478 --> 00:49:28.380]  It's the Declaration of Independence, Mr. Maddow.
[00:49:29.201 --> 00:49:29.421]  Okay?
[00:49:31.482 --> 00:49:36.746]  I'm sorry that a lot of men in this country still wear pants and aren't going to be the slaves of Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan.
[00:49:37.447 --> 00:49:44.132]  I'm sorry that some of us have read 1984 and know telescreens going in at locations everywhere telling us to spy on our neighbors hidden freedom.
[00:49:45.253 --> 00:49:46.514]  You like to pose as a liberal?
[00:49:46.874 --> 00:49:50.016]  The real liberals were the founding fathers, classical liberals.
[00:49:50.277 --> 00:49:53.119]  Liberal means freedom, the opposite of what you deliver.
[00:49:54.642 --> 00:49:55.343]  And you don't like it.
[00:49:55.383 --> 00:49:56.625]  Now she goes after yours truly.
[00:49:56.645 --> 00:49:56.965]  Here it is.
[00:50:08.609 --> 00:50:10.030]  Americans are asked, why are you buying guns?
[00:50:10.310 --> 00:50:14.052]  They're buying it for civil unrest and to fight back against government tyranny.
[00:50:14.072 --> 00:50:16.993]  It's conservative talk radio host Alex Jones.
[00:50:17.133 --> 00:50:17.293]  Yeah.
[00:50:17.814 --> 00:50:19.795]  We essentially have two choices.
[00:50:19.815 --> 00:50:20.715]  That's enough from Mr. Maddow.
[00:50:20.735 --> 00:50:22.096]  About what kind of country we are.
[00:50:22.116 --> 00:50:24.777]  You know, I'm done with these people, OK?
[00:50:25.237 --> 00:50:25.738]  I'm done.
[00:50:26.258 --> 00:50:29.419]  I'm done with their violence, their wars killing millions of people.
[00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:31.220]  And I want to tell conservatives something.
[00:50:31.601 --> 00:50:37.604]  If you want to really save America and you're really a conservative, say no to the wars, say no to the torture, say no to the empire.
[00:50:38.984 --> 00:50:40.305]  That is not a conservative position.
[00:50:40.546 --> 00:50:48.111]  And you notice the last two years in a row, Ron Paul gets standing ovations at CPAC, the most powerful Republican meeting, when he says that.
[00:50:48.851 --> 00:50:50.252]  Look, the system is panicking.
[00:50:50.292 --> 00:50:52.834]  We're taking over the liberal wing, the right-wing wing.
[00:50:53.034 --> 00:50:54.255]  We're taking America back.
[00:50:54.495 --> 00:50:56.797]  And you guys are going to try to stage events to make us look bad?
[00:50:56.817 --> 00:50:58.518]  Go ahead and try, terrorist!
[00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:03.943]  Your natural organic herbal formula for heart health is Heart and Body Extract.
[00:51:04.003 --> 00:51:07.866]  My name is Van, and I'm 68 years old and I live in Vermont.
[00:51:08.206 --> 00:51:12.690]  In the spring of 2003, I started to have problems with my heart.
[00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:14.871]  It felt like my heart was pounding.
[00:51:14.891 --> 00:51:16.332]  It made me feel breathless.
[00:51:16.753 --> 00:51:20.796]  I tried many, many different things to try to get some help for myself.
[00:51:21.196 --> 00:51:22.217]  Nothing did anything.
[00:51:22.277 --> 00:51:26.200]  Heart and Body Extract is very powerful, very effective, and works quickly.
[00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:29.682]  I saw one of Sharon's ads in Ordered Heart and Body Extract.
[00:51:30.363 --> 00:51:33.044]  I noticed a difference quickly, within days.
[00:51:33.465 --> 00:51:38.128]  The episodes became less frequent, and by a month I completely vanished.
[00:51:38.459 --> 00:51:41.062]  Usually you find a 30 day or 60 day guarantee.
[00:51:41.282 --> 00:51:45.888]  Heart and Body Extract comes with a lifetime 100% ironclad money back guarantee.
[00:51:46.068 --> 00:51:48.210]  Details at HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305.
[00:51:48.270 --> 00:51:48.511]  Call 866-295-5305.
[00:51:48.531 --> 00:51:49.412]  866-295-5305 for Heart and Body Extract.
[00:51:59.523 --> 00:52:01.846]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:52:01.906 --> 00:52:04.109]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:52:04.229 --> 00:52:07.053]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:07.454 --> 00:52:12.200]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:16.746]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:17.046 --> 00:52:19.389]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:19.409 --> 00:52:21.933]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:22.293 --> 00:52:24.856]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:25.217 --> 00:52:32.807]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:33.143 --> 00:52:38.428]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:38.528 --> 00:52:41.310]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:44.813]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:45.073 --> 00:52:45.974]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:46.154 --> 00:52:47.455]  You're everyone else.
[00:52:47.475 --> 00:52:48.496]  Invisible Empire.

[00:53:53.346 --> 00:54:08.113]  We've got a photo up on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers of Mr. Maddow.
[00:54:08.774 --> 00:54:13.236]  That's back when Mr. Maddow was the spokesman nationwide for big and tall men's shops.
[00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:15.430]  I'm sorry.
[00:54:16.070 --> 00:54:18.111]  In the face of this tyranny, I just can't handle it.
[00:54:19.131 --> 00:54:19.632]  Oh, man.
[00:54:19.692 --> 00:54:21.612]  Hey, be who you are, Mr. Maddow.
[00:54:22.152 --> 00:54:24.593]  I just can't handle it.
[00:54:24.633 --> 00:54:27.614]  These people have all got an axe to grind.
[00:54:27.654 --> 00:54:30.015]  They want to make us think and act the way they do.
[00:54:30.255 --> 00:54:32.176]  Look, I want you to have liberty, Mr. Maddow.
[00:54:32.196 --> 00:54:32.836]  Do what you want.
[00:54:33.216 --> 00:54:34.896]  Leave me and mine alone.
[00:54:35.217 --> 00:54:36.997]  We don't want to be brainwashed by you.
[00:54:37.057 --> 00:54:39.158]  We don't want to be under your control grid.
[00:54:40.098 --> 00:54:42.199]  But you're saying this is somehow un-American.
[00:54:43.152 --> 00:54:48.838]  Uh, that, uh, we're talking about the Declaration of Independence and our right and our duty.
[00:54:49.299 --> 00:54:50.820]  I mean, go read the Declaration of Independence.
[00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:52.702]  I challenge every police officer listening.
[00:54:53.082 --> 00:54:56.446]  Read the Declaration of Independence and then ask, are you following this?
[00:54:57.167 --> 00:54:58.328]  No, this is the opposite.
[00:54:58.588 --> 00:55:00.690]  You are taught the Declaration of Independence is bad.
[00:55:00.810 --> 00:55:03.493]  I have FEMA videos of police being taught that.
[00:55:03.793 --> 00:55:05.155]  It's in my film, Road to Tyranny.
[00:55:06.408 --> 00:55:08.150]  Of course, it was shot by good people in the meeting.
[00:55:08.850 --> 00:55:12.954]  And the truth is, I've seen national polls of 98% of cops being pro-Second Amendment.
[00:55:14.596 --> 00:55:18.600]  But the problem is, under peer pressure, they went ahead and confiscated the guns.
[00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:20.642]  They had cops from all over the country in New Orleans.
[00:55:23.612 --> 00:55:35.978]  We're at a crossroads here, and they've got the FBI going out to conservative bloggers' houses, going along with the hoax that conservatives influenced this guy on hallucinogens, completely out of his mind.
[00:55:36.338 --> 00:55:37.358]  It's ridiculous!
[00:55:38.139 --> 00:55:47.063]  Only in a collectivist, authoritarian state, under the Nazis and the Communists, if somebody did something wrong on your block, you got in trouble for it.
[00:55:48.595 --> 00:55:50.516]  That's not the American way.
[00:55:50.716 --> 00:55:51.697]  That's not freedom.
[00:55:52.037 --> 00:55:54.079]  Just 30, 40 years ago, the U.S.
[00:55:54.099 --> 00:55:55.380]  was the model of the world.
[00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:58.181]  It wasn't perfect, but it wrote the book on freedom.
[00:55:58.642 --> 00:56:01.984]  Now, it's selling tyranny worldwide as liberty.
[00:56:02.584 --> 00:56:04.626]  This is not land of the free, home of the brave.
[00:56:05.899 --> 00:56:07.379]  We've got to make it that again!
[00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:12.120]  We got our guests coming up at 8 after, but I got a bunch of other news I want to get to here.
[00:56:12.881 --> 00:56:16.281]  I just want to really ask listeners today to get this.
[00:56:16.822 --> 00:56:17.162]  You know what?
[00:56:17.182 --> 00:56:20.843]  We've actually begun to fail getting the number one search term.
[00:56:20.883 --> 00:56:22.703]  We'd always gotten it in the past.
[00:56:23.083 --> 00:56:28.884]  Lately, I guess because it's such big news days, we've only been getting second place, third place.
[00:56:29.325 --> 00:56:31.185]  I'd like to make this number one today.
[00:56:32.365 --> 00:56:35.226]  I'd like to make witch hunt
[00:56:37.458 --> 00:56:37.658]  FBI
[00:56:54.554 --> 00:56:55.274]  Again, witch hunt.
[00:56:55.434 --> 00:56:59.255]  FBI visiting conservative bloggers after Tucson shootings.
[00:56:59.755 --> 00:57:01.456]  I mean, this is commissars.
[00:57:01.496 --> 00:57:02.676]  This is political police.
[00:57:03.016 --> 00:57:03.836]  This is hardcore.
[00:57:03.856 --> 00:57:04.817]  Let's search that term.
[00:57:04.857 --> 00:57:06.217]  Let's make it number one.
[00:57:06.637 --> 00:57:09.898]  I'm going to enter it into Google and then hit enter over and over again.
[00:57:10.398 --> 00:57:12.819]  Witch hunt FBI.
[00:57:13.279 --> 00:57:18.140]  And they got local newscasts in the story we put together, posted there, like it's normal.
[00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:20.761]  Why, he asked about campaign contributions.
[00:57:20.981 --> 00:57:21.601]  Politely!
[00:57:22.201 --> 00:57:23.102]  Oh my gosh!
[00:57:23.662 --> 00:57:24.482]  Oh my gosh!
[00:57:24.542 --> 00:57:25.442]  This is horrible!
[00:57:25.682 --> 00:57:26.742]  This is unacceptable!
[00:57:27.063 --> 00:57:32.224]  What does the Oklahoma report bordering Arkansas?
[00:57:32.524 --> 00:57:33.184]  What does it say?
[00:57:33.464 --> 00:57:36.325]  It says, are they talking about controversial issues at a political meeting?
[00:57:36.625 --> 00:57:38.265]  Go ahead and call Homeland Security on them.
[00:57:38.945 --> 00:57:40.006]  Watch their speech!
[00:57:41.406 --> 00:57:43.106]  This is what the threat fusion centers are.
[00:57:43.166 --> 00:57:44.927]  This is the secret police takeover.
[00:57:46.340 --> 00:57:51.626]  We're going to come back and get into a bunch of other news, and we're going to get into health news, places we can at least take action and protect ourselves.
[00:57:53.007 --> 00:57:58.073]  Before I go any further, this radio broadcast is possible because of your support.
[00:57:58.373 --> 00:58:05.421]  Support with the sponsors, visiting the online video bookstore that also has t-shirts, ball caps, you know, anti-New World Order stuff.
[00:58:05.501 --> 00:58:07.943]  The government would call it terrorist because it's American.
[00:58:08.644 --> 00:58:11.986]  Uh, you know, dyed in the wool, heart of America, doesn't get any more Americana.
[00:58:12.006 --> 00:58:12.406]  They hate it.
[00:58:12.686 --> 00:58:13.787]  Because they're not Americans.
[00:58:13.807 --> 00:58:14.307]  They're the enemy.
[00:58:14.667 --> 00:58:15.307]  Foreign globalists.
[00:58:15.948 --> 00:58:16.708]  Uh, it's real simple.
[00:58:16.728 --> 00:58:19.810]  We've been conquered by financial crooks, put in a police state to make sure they can get away with it.

[00:58:54.234 --> 00:59:00.278]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:59:00.638 --> 00:59:07.743]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:59:08.024 --> 00:59:12.567]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:25.286]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[00:59:25.822 --> 00:59:31.984]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:59:32.584 --> 00:59:35.965]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[00:59:55.357 --> 00:59:58.122]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:04.758 --> 01:00:08.962]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.583 --> 01:00:10.403]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.184 --> 01:00:12.085]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.726 --> 01:00:16.309]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.909 --> 01:00:21.013]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:29.093 --> 01:00:30.975]  You know, we've got a heavy news day.
[01:00:31.015 --> 01:00:33.776]  I'm going to be blitzing through all of it coming up in the next hour.
[01:00:33.796 --> 01:00:36.538]  Houston stops couple outreach to homeless.
[01:00:36.838 --> 01:00:38.159]  Must have feeding permit.
[01:00:38.499 --> 01:00:39.640]  Land of the free, home of the brave.
[01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:49.065]  All over the country they're telling Christian groups, Muslims, Jewish groups, can't have any neighbors over for a Sunday supper or for Ramadan.
[01:00:49.506 --> 01:00:51.127]  I mean, it's just total tyranny.
[01:00:51.447 --> 01:00:54.529]  But if you want to run around naked in the streets or recruit
[01:00:54.989 --> 01:00:59.213]  You know, five-year-olds, to your sexual persuasion, that's fine, you can go ahead and do it.
[01:00:59.993 --> 01:01:01.235]  Got all of that going on.
[01:01:02.075 --> 01:01:04.758]  Mexican gunman fires across border towards U.S.
[01:01:04.798 --> 01:01:05.558]  highway workers.
[01:01:05.939 --> 01:01:06.940]  Well, it's just like Arizona.
[01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:13.225]  Americans aren't supposed to go, whether they're Hispanic, white, black, doesn't matter, you're not supposed to go south of Tucson.
[01:01:13.405 --> 01:01:16.067]  And they got government signs up saying, don't go into these areas.
[01:01:16.588 --> 01:01:18.470]  And it's like, look, you're not supposed to be here.
[01:01:18.530 --> 01:01:19.430]  Don't fix that road.
[01:01:20.351 --> 01:01:21.772]  And of course, it's the Mexican military.
[01:01:22.432 --> 01:01:28.336]  And if you're an American riding around on a lake, you're going to get your head blown off, and the controlled media will say it doesn't exist and make fun of you.
[01:01:29.996 --> 01:01:34.399]  When there's a tragedy that they don't like, oh, he didn't get shot in the head, the woman didn't see that.
[01:01:34.639 --> 01:01:37.761]  Then they send Mexican police to find the body and they cut their heads off.
[01:01:38.081 --> 01:01:41.063]  Then they have articles about nobody's getting their heads cut off.
[01:01:41.743 --> 01:01:42.804]  We've got that going on.
[01:01:43.664 --> 01:01:45.405]  Of course, the big news is not news here.
[01:01:46.126 --> 01:01:50.309]  We told you three months ago with Lindsey Williams.
[01:01:50.890 --> 01:01:56.034]  It was back in... It was back in October.
[01:01:57.517 --> 01:01:58.577]  October, November, December.
[01:01:58.617 --> 01:01:59.498]  Yeah, three months ago.
[01:01:59.518 --> 01:02:00.598]  It was the middle of October.
[01:02:00.818 --> 01:02:03.339]  You can pull up those interviews at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:02:03.419 --> 01:02:04.299]  They're all over the web.
[01:02:04.539 --> 01:02:08.180]  They're in the audio archives on Infowars.com, just down the right-hand side of the page.
[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:14.402]  Back in October, Lindsey Williams talked to his former oil company executive, former head of Atlantic Richfield, who's now died.
[01:02:15.242 --> 01:02:19.467]  We've now given you the name of Mr. X. The other guy was the CEO of an even bigger oil company.
[01:02:19.487 --> 01:02:20.409]  He's still got that source.
[01:02:20.849 --> 01:02:23.352]  And they both told him they said it's going to go to 150 to 200 by the end of 2011.
[01:02:28.866 --> 01:02:32.349]  And back then, it was $60 a barrel, and everybody laughed at Lindsey Williams.
[01:02:33.110 --> 01:02:39.235]  Didn't matter that he said when oil was $60 a barrel back in 2008 that within a year it'd be $150.
[01:02:39.275 --> 01:02:40.716]  And it was.
[01:02:40.957 --> 01:02:41.737]  Celia's laughed at.
[01:02:42.378 --> 01:02:44.199]  Well, now it's upwards of $100 a barrel.
[01:02:46.650 --> 01:02:58.347]  from sixty dollars a barrel and that'll translate when it goes to a hundred and fifty uh... to uh... we're talking about five dollars at the uh... pomp on average right now it's gonna go above three nationwide and it goes up to uh...
[01:02:59.750 --> 01:03:03.454]  I mean, if it goes up to $200, it might be $6, $7 a gallon.
[01:03:03.774 --> 01:03:06.717]  But if it goes to $150, you're talking $5 a gallon.
[01:03:06.977 --> 01:03:09.619]  And again, those are rough guesstimates, but we saw what happened a few years ago.
[01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:12.482]  And so they know how to put the pressure on us, then relieve it.
[01:03:12.762 --> 01:03:14.064]  Put the pressure on us, relieve it.
[01:03:14.464 --> 01:03:18.107]  And of course, nowhere in the media are they discussing why this is really happening.
[01:03:18.408 --> 01:03:19.609]  The main driver
[01:03:21.001 --> 01:03:21.281]  Yes.
[01:03:34.892 --> 01:03:36.493]  Well, Russia's a big oil exporter.
[01:03:36.934 --> 01:03:38.255]  China's a big oil importer.
[01:03:38.515 --> 01:03:45.280]  They both announced they're going to deal in oil and natural gas and other petroleum products in the Chinese currency.
[01:03:46.081 --> 01:03:48.202]  And now it's beginning to trade on the international market.
[01:03:48.543 --> 01:04:00.312]  So the slide, the exodus, the race away from the good old dollar is accelerating.
[01:04:00.372 --> 01:04:03.615]  And so you're going to see gold, silver, oil, food,
[01:04:04.741 --> 01:04:06.342]  What was in Reuters yesterday?
[01:04:06.422 --> 01:04:07.763]  Food prices double!
[01:04:09.183 --> 01:04:10.804]  Food prices explode!
[01:04:11.044 --> 01:04:13.285]  Who told you food prices three years ago was going to go up?
[01:04:13.546 --> 01:04:13.826]  We did.
[01:04:14.858 --> 01:04:18.560]  Who told you back when silver was $5 an ounce, it was going to go up to above $20?
[01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:19.841]  Now it's up at $30.
[01:04:20.081 --> 01:04:20.421]  We did.
[01:04:21.041 --> 01:04:25.624]  Who told you that when gold was $265 an ounce, that it was going to go up well above $1,000?
[01:04:26.424 --> 01:04:26.825]  We did.
[01:04:28.406 --> 01:04:32.088]  Who told you that they would put in telescreens in public telling you to watch your neighbors?
[01:04:32.488 --> 01:04:36.550]  I put that in several of my films going back, what, eight, nine years ago.
[01:04:36.570 --> 01:04:37.290]  It's in Police State 3.
[01:04:38.579 --> 01:04:40.040]  And it's also in Masters of Terror.
[01:04:40.060 --> 01:04:40.841]  Who told you we did?
[01:04:41.161 --> 01:04:41.921]  I'm not bragging.
[01:04:42.062 --> 01:04:44.523]  I mean, I know the Globalist Handbook.
[01:04:44.543 --> 01:04:46.245]  I mean, I know what they've done everywhere else.
[01:04:46.765 --> 01:04:47.926]  I know what they're setting up.
[01:04:49.487 --> 01:04:53.530]  They've got a new iPhone mind control, mind reading app.
[01:04:54.070 --> 01:04:55.771]  Told you about that a year ago.
[01:04:56.232 --> 01:04:57.313]  And it's all coming out now.
[01:04:57.673 --> 01:04:58.213]  It ain't pretty.
[01:04:58.453 --> 01:04:58.874]  Stay with us.
[01:05:00.063 --> 01:05:01.203]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:05:01.243 --> 01:05:07.906]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:05:08.166 --> 01:05:10.447]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:05:10.727 --> 01:05:15.929]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:05:16.089 --> 01:05:18.870]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:05:19.130 --> 01:05:21.271]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:05:21.451 --> 01:05:27.393]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:05:27.713 --> 01:05:28.133]  In fact,
[01:05:28.413 --> 01:05:30.894]  Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:05:31.074 --> 01:05:36.596]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:05:36.856 --> 01:05:38.177]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:05:38.497 --> 01:05:39.698]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:05:39.798 --> 01:05:42.339]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:05:42.459 --> 01:05:46.520]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:05:46.701 --> 01:05:51.182]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[01:05:51.322 --> 01:05:53.763]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[01:05:53.903 --> 01:05:56.945]  Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[01:05:57.765 --> 01:05:59.466]  That's endofamerica3.com.
[01:06:00.046 --> 01:06:03.348]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[01:06:03.629 --> 01:06:04.689]  It ended on June of 2009.
[01:06:04.749 --> 01:06:09.112]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[01:06:09.312 --> 01:06:14.976]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[01:06:15.256 --> 01:06:17.237]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[01:06:17.417 --> 01:06:20.099]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[01:06:20.439 --> 01:06:26.742]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[01:06:26.943 --> 01:06:28.744]  They both make fabulous investments.
[01:06:29.144 --> 01:06:34.226]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[01:06:34.487 --> 01:06:39.469]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[01:06:39.769 --> 01:06:44.992]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[01:06:45.132 --> 01:06:48.074]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[01:06:48.334 --> 01:06:51.220]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:52.102]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[01:07:00.689 --> 01:07:04.333]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:07:04.733 --> 01:07:07.737]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:07:07.957 --> 01:07:12.742]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:07:12.762 --> 01:07:19.009]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:07:19.149 --> 01:07:21.392]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:07:21.932 --> 01:07:22.212]  Tim Geithner?
[01:07:22.232 --> 01:07:22.652]  Bernanke?
[01:07:22.732 --> 01:07:23.513]  They're arsonists!
[01:07:23.533 --> 01:07:24.673]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:07:24.693 --> 01:07:26.934]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:07:40.819 --> 01:07:42.661]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:07:42.681 --> 01:07:47.726]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:07:48.106 --> 01:07:57.235]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:08:04.827 --> 01:08:09.150]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:08:09.651 --> 01:08:10.492]  You want answers?
[01:08:11.252 --> 01:08:12.733]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:12.793 --> 01:08:16.416]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:16.977 --> 01:08:21.120]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:24.423 --> 01:08:28.266]  It is an admitted fact that world oil prices
[01:08:33.850 --> 01:08:40.995]  And it is a fact that we have an inside track to two.
[01:08:41.856 --> 01:08:45.599]  One a CEO, one the director of two major oil companies.
[01:08:45.679 --> 01:08:47.981]  One of them just died via Lindsey Williams.
[01:08:48.021 --> 01:08:48.982]  We know their names.
[01:08:49.762 --> 01:08:51.183]  We just can't reveal those on air.
[01:08:51.243 --> 01:08:52.524]  We've now revealed the guy that died.
[01:08:52.545 --> 01:08:55.267]  And they told you three months ago it would be going up from $60 a
[01:08:57.469 --> 01:09:01.172]  Uh, barrel to 150 to 200 by the end of 2011.
[01:09:02.153 --> 01:09:06.278]  And now here's the headline, $100 a barrel oil, deal with it.
[01:09:06.298 --> 01:09:11.043]  Uh, that's the headline, uh, out of the Associated Press.
[01:09:11.783 --> 01:09:13.065]  Uh, it's also up on the Drudge Report.
[01:09:13.085 --> 01:09:20.573]  Uh, continuing, UK warning, oil prices may kill economy and the coalition.
[01:09:22.094 --> 01:09:24.115]  MSNBC is also reporting on it.
[01:09:24.255 --> 01:09:28.335]  OPEC ministers say World can handle $100 a barrel oil.
[01:09:28.956 --> 01:09:33.937]  Other exporters indicate the cartel may not increase crude oil production.
[01:09:33.957 --> 01:09:38.738]  Well, good thing that we're seeing record exploration here on the ground in the United States.
[01:09:38.818 --> 01:09:42.659]  I know they're drilling all over Texas and hitting natural gas and oil.
[01:09:43.399 --> 01:09:47.182]  And they're trying to slap all sorts of federal regulations on them to stop it from getting out of the ground.
[01:09:47.722 --> 01:09:50.123]  Our economy is completely dependent on oil and gas.
[01:09:50.884 --> 01:09:54.826]  And our society is designed along those lines.
[01:09:55.447 --> 01:10:05.594]  And we have absolutely got to start moving towards energy independence.
[01:10:05.714 --> 01:10:07.255]  But when you look at
[01:10:08.021 --> 01:10:11.063]  The internal intelligence we got years ago that's now mainstream news.
[01:10:11.384 --> 01:10:13.265]  We've only got two pipelines out of Alaska.
[01:10:13.445 --> 01:10:15.687]  They could have 50 out of Alaska.
[01:10:15.707 --> 01:10:17.728]  They claim, oh, you can't get rid of them and it hurts the caribou.
[01:10:17.888 --> 01:10:20.130]  The caribou sleep under it and use it for shelter.
[01:10:20.490 --> 01:10:23.372]  It's like a ship being sunk in the Caribbean.
[01:10:23.412 --> 01:10:25.214]  It turns into a natural reef.
[01:10:25.754 --> 01:10:29.477]  I mean, this is what is basically needed.
[01:10:29.497 --> 01:10:30.858]  It doesn't hurt the environment at all.
[01:10:31.218 --> 01:10:42.844]  We could have more oil out of Alaska than we get from Saudi Arabia, but we can't have it because the government and the big cartels on record only allow a small amount of the oil out of Alaska to go to the U.S.
[01:10:42.884 --> 01:10:44.705]  Roughly 20% goes to the West Coast.
[01:10:45.045 --> 01:10:48.047]  The rest goes to China and to Japan.
[01:10:48.887 --> 01:10:52.689]  So it is just incredible to see that unfolding.
[01:10:54.191 --> 01:11:03.815]  Continuing here with the news, you notice that there are reports that as much as half of Australia is now underwater.
[01:11:04.035 --> 01:11:10.818]  They're calling it a brown sea or a brown ocean, as just tens of thousands of square miles are now underwater.
[01:11:11.258 --> 01:11:15.480]  They had been in a long drought and, you know, times are thick, times are thin.
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:16.680]  That can naturally happen.
[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:23.363]  But I noticed reports going back to August 8th of last year out of the Sydney Morning Herald,
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:47.601]  uh... report uh... rain making comes to australia and it goes on a rain making method developed uh... by thai king in thailand is set to aid queensland in battles with drought after an agreement between the state government and the thai royal household
[01:11:48.041 --> 01:11:56.587]  The technique largely relies on cloud seeding, generally undertaking using chemicals to promote the formation of water droplets within the cloud formations.
[01:11:56.907 --> 01:12:03.332]  There are several stages in the process with sodium chloride used in the final stage to trigger rain.
[01:12:10.512 --> 01:12:16.695]  And I remember back in 1998, they had a big flood in Texas, and it killed more than 30 people in one night in South Texas.
[01:12:16.915 --> 01:12:30.320]  And there was a little blurb in the San Antonio Express News, just a small blurb about, oh, the Navy was doing weather modification drills in the area with their aircraft, but we don't know if there's any connection to that.
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:32.221]  A FOIA request is going to be filed.
[01:12:32.461 --> 01:12:47.609]  And I never saw what the end result of that was, but they act like, oh, the Chinese have developed this, or oh, the Germans have developed it, oh, the Russians have developed it, oh, the Russians for the parade are going to clear the snowy skies, or the Chinese are guaranteeing no rain for the Olympics.
[01:12:47.669 --> 01:12:53.453]  They have weather control systems with antennas, and now in Oman and other countries in the Middle East, they're creating rain.
[01:12:54.173 --> 01:12:56.455]  And then you talk about it and our media says you're a kook.
[01:12:57.156 --> 01:12:59.017]  Our government developed all of this stuff.
[01:12:59.358 --> 01:13:08.406]  They were using rockets 150 plus years ago, in the 1850s, that's 160 years ago, to seed clouds and cause thunderstorms.
[01:13:09.227 --> 01:13:12.410]  Before the Wright Brothers ever took off at Kitty Hawk.
[01:13:14.431 --> 01:13:14.712]  Okay?
[01:13:16.073 --> 01:13:20.337]  And I've had Ben Livingston on this radio show
[01:13:23.510 --> 01:13:28.795]  The father of weather weapons, and he couldn't talk about it until it was declassified, what, in 2004.
[01:13:29.696 --> 01:13:40.226]  And when it was declassified, the history of weather weapons, at least up to 1970, he was the guy after, he was a World War II pilot, fighter pilot, what a character, he flew into
[01:13:41.267 --> 01:13:42.228]  uh... hurricanes
[01:14:11.227 --> 01:14:18.709]  That Ben Livingston came on this show, and I saw him in the local newspaper talking about weather weapons, and he had all the documents that he could now show us, and I flew him to Austin to be interviewed.
[01:14:18.949 --> 01:14:21.830]  That interview is being posted on PrisonPlanet.tv next week.
[01:14:22.531 --> 01:14:25.171]  Exclusive stuff, never before seen, not just the original interview.
[01:14:25.912 --> 01:14:28.212]  And he was mad because, I guess it was 2005, we just had Katrina.
[01:14:30.473 --> 01:14:44.848]  And he said, in 67, it was certified by the Navy, by the Air Force, by Stanford Research Institute, that we could create hurricanes, kill hurricanes, weaken hurricanes, whatever we wanted, with just eight aircraft, and that was with old technology.
[01:14:47.259 --> 01:14:49.442]  So, this needs to be looked into.
[01:14:49.583 --> 01:15:02.161]  Did the weather modification, nobody's talking about this, a month into the floods in Australia, none of the Australian news are talking about it, that they started massive weather modification to end the drought in Australia, in the area.
[01:15:03.339 --> 01:15:04.939]  That has seen these incredible floods.
[01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:09.061]  I think that that is very, very important.
[01:15:09.821 --> 01:15:17.123]  Okay, we are now joined for the rest of the hour, and a little bit into the next hour, because we had some phone issues on our end and got him on a little bit late.
[01:15:18.303 --> 01:15:22.505]  Dr. Joel Wallach has been a guest on before, and we had so many people request that he get back on.
[01:15:22.965 --> 01:15:28.586]  I remember before I was even really awake to the New World Order fully, people were bringing up Dead Doctors Don't Lie.
[01:15:28.606 --> 01:15:29.987]  That's a syndicated radio program.
[01:15:31.377 --> 01:15:55.964]  uh... syndicated by the great folks on california uh... mc uh... and and and uh... out of some of our affiliates there in santa cruz uh... but uh... dr wallach lives in the midwest and he's a uh... veterinarian uh... he's also a doctor of naturopathic medicine in india he was nominated for the nobel prize in nineteen ninety one and uh... a lot of what he discovered as as a doctor but also as a vet is a lot of the same things that
[01:15:56.644 --> 01:16:03.124]  Linus Pauling, the two-time Nobel Prize winner, talked about minerals and vitamin deficiencies, but the system knows that!
[01:16:03.789 --> 01:16:16.874]  And they don't want to put things out that will then end a lot of these illnesses in the gravy train of treating the disease or the problem caused by the lack of minerals and the lack of vitamins.
[01:16:16.894 --> 01:16:19.434]  Now, I worked for a large animal vet off and on for three years.
[01:16:20.895 --> 01:16:23.136]  I worked also for a small animal vet in high school.
[01:16:23.936 --> 01:16:28.538]  And I remember routinely the large animal vet would do a diagnosis on cows, horses, whatever.
[01:16:28.578 --> 01:16:30.018]  They'd say, this is a vitamin deficiency.
[01:16:30.858 --> 01:16:31.399]  Give them this.
[01:16:31.479 --> 01:16:32.419]  And usually it worked.
[01:16:33.399 --> 01:16:37.180]  And then later there might be some of the more, you know, mainline stuff used.
[01:16:37.380 --> 01:16:39.321]  So this is stuff known out there.
[01:16:39.561 --> 01:16:41.621]  The system just doesn't want you to be aware of it.
[01:16:42.161 --> 01:16:44.862]  And so we're really honored to have Dr. Wallach on with us.
[01:16:44.942 --> 01:16:46.102]  And I've done research.
[01:16:46.162 --> 01:16:49.863]  I've looked for people to partner with and to work with.
[01:16:50.143 --> 01:16:51.764]  And you're going to be hearing him on every month now.
[01:16:52.564 --> 01:17:02.830]  Uh, and I've tried to do research on who really has the information, who really has the answers, who is truly, you know, legitimate and bona fide, and Dr. Wallach is the man.
[01:17:03.330 --> 01:17:04.531]  And we're also launching...
[01:17:05.794 --> 01:17:06.074]  I don't
[01:17:27.432 --> 01:17:33.839]  Mineral and trace element products that Dr. Wallach and his team have developed over the decades.
[01:17:33.859 --> 01:17:34.579]  It's just amazing.
[01:17:34.679 --> 01:17:36.481]  Infowarsteam.com.
[01:17:36.521 --> 01:17:38.383]  You can join up, get big discounts.
[01:17:38.403 --> 01:17:39.644]  You can also get others to sign up.
[01:17:40.285 --> 01:17:43.889]  I've been approached a million times about being part of something like this and said no.
[01:17:44.449 --> 01:17:56.337]  This is a company that's doing something real, that is valuable, and in this imploding economy, it's also something that InfoWars listeners and others can get involved in and help people and also help themselves.
[01:17:56.397 --> 01:17:58.439]  It's a win-win-win-win-win situation.
[01:17:58.459 --> 01:18:00.040]  We're going to break here.
[01:18:00.100 --> 01:18:01.561]  You know, we got him on late.
[01:18:01.641 --> 01:18:02.481]  I'm going to skip this break.
[01:18:02.501 --> 01:18:03.382]  I haven't done that in a few weeks.
[01:18:03.642 --> 01:18:06.064]  I'm going to skip this break with Dr. Joel Wallach.
[01:18:06.444 --> 01:18:09.886]  Research has resulted in the publication of more than 70 peer-reviewed and
[01:18:11.107 --> 01:18:21.297]  A referee to journals, articles in the field of nutrition and pharmacological research, and he has made major contributions to eight major authored texts and reference books on these subjects.
[01:18:21.697 --> 01:18:26.241]  Doctor of Veterinary Medicine, Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine, and we appreciate him joining us.
[01:18:26.301 --> 01:18:27.262]  And again, check it all out.
[01:18:27.302 --> 01:18:28.944]  We're going to be adding more videos, more audio.
[01:18:29.484 --> 01:18:32.027]  There's already quite a bit there at InfoWarsTeam.com.
[01:18:32.307 --> 01:18:33.488]  Teaming up with Dr. Wallach.
[01:18:33.748 --> 01:18:35.070]  Doctor, great to have you on with us.
[01:18:35.430 --> 01:18:36.551]  Well, thank you so much, Alex.
[01:18:36.691 --> 01:18:42.015]  I really appreciate your hospitality and your comradeship, and we're both on the same train, that's for sure.
[01:18:42.795 --> 01:18:43.336]  Absolutely.
[01:18:43.396 --> 01:18:55.845]  Tell us about your awakening and how important this is that mineral and vitamin deficiencies is what's causing so many of the problems, and the system knows this, but they want you to be sick to make money off of you.
[01:18:56.445 --> 01:18:58.647]  Well, you've hit the nail right on the head, Alex.
[01:18:59.147 --> 01:19:00.468]  Being a veterinarian, we learned
[01:19:01.098 --> 01:19:09.660]  Gosh, 100 years ago, actually longer than that, maybe 110 years ago, we could prevent and cure as many as 900 different diseases using vitamins and minerals.
[01:19:10.340 --> 01:19:18.482]  If we were to use the same health care system for livestock to be used for people, your hamburger would cost you $285 a pound just to pay for the health care.
[01:19:19.122 --> 01:19:30.025]  We learned a long time ago that we could keep the price of eggs and meat and vegetables and fruit and bread and stuff down to where the average person could afford to eat it simply by eliminating health care costs.
[01:19:30.655 --> 01:19:35.319]  You know, a single insurance company or insurance policy prevents or cures disease.
[01:19:35.739 --> 01:19:40.683]  When you buy an insurance policy to pay your premium, you're betting you're going to screw up somewhere along the line.
[01:19:40.703 --> 01:19:47.529]  You're going to have a big doctor or hospital bill, and so you're building up that insurance fund so that you can pay those bills.
[01:19:48.210 --> 01:19:50.732]  And it's still up to us individually to stay healthy.
[01:19:51.312 --> 01:19:56.737]  And so I've spent, since 1964, literally educating the public on this.
[01:19:57.216 --> 01:20:01.058]  Because it's really a tragedy that we can prevent every birth defects in animals.
[01:20:01.158 --> 01:20:02.879]  Nobody's paying attention for the humans.
[01:20:03.259 --> 01:20:07.101]  Every OBGYN should be put in jail because all birth defects are eliminatable.
[01:20:07.781 --> 01:20:18.447]  We don't need to be raising $80 million a year for muscular dystrophy, Jerry's kids, because we already figured out how to prevent and cure muscular dystrophy back in 1957 in livestock.
[01:20:18.987 --> 01:20:20.628]  Because muscle is meat.
[01:20:20.848 --> 01:20:23.929]  If anything affects the meat industry, it's fixed quick.
[01:20:23.949 --> 01:20:25.070]  So we learned that.
[01:20:25.598 --> 01:20:32.161]  So I've known this since actually 1962, that we were in big trouble with the healthcare system.
[01:20:32.181 --> 01:20:33.701]  Been yelling about it ever since then.
[01:20:34.342 --> 01:20:38.904]  And I'm so glad to have this association with you now, because you're the guy that can get the word out to the public.
[01:20:41.945 --> 01:20:45.626]  Well, Dr. Wallach, it's just been invaluable what you've discovered.
[01:20:45.646 --> 01:20:48.928]  Let's go through some of the studies of the peer-reviewed journals that you've co-authored.
[01:20:50.269 --> 01:20:56.813]  Well, a lot of people, Alex, say, well, okay, okay, Wally, but why were you the one chosen to do that big National Institute for Health study?
[01:20:57.493 --> 01:21:04.377]  The book covers 20,000 autopsies, 10 million chemistries, the Smithsonian Institute is a national treasure.
[01:21:04.938 --> 01:21:06.959]  Why did they pick you, dumb Missouri farm boy?
[01:21:07.559 --> 01:21:15.684]  That's because in 1962, I was the first guy to actually run into the first pollution
[01:21:16.303 --> 01:21:17.084]  Mass die off.
[01:21:17.104 --> 01:21:19.827]  Pollution caused mass die off in livestock and published it.
[01:21:20.768 --> 01:21:23.290]  And it was actually a bunch of feeder lambs.
[01:21:23.430 --> 01:21:25.813]  One guy had lost 500 lambs in one night.
[01:21:26.433 --> 01:21:31.839]  Because over time they had been chronically poisoned with nitrates and nitrites of fertilizer that had gotten into his well.
[01:21:32.686 --> 01:21:36.368]  And affected their thyroid glands when they had a sharp dip in the temperature.
[01:21:36.448 --> 01:21:38.450]  It got down to 19 degrees that night.
[01:21:38.770 --> 01:21:41.191]  He lost every one of his lambs, 500 lambs.
[01:21:41.672 --> 01:21:45.434]  All the surrounding people, all the other surrounding farmers didn't have the same problem.
[01:21:45.834 --> 01:21:52.618]  And I documented it very well with nitrate levels in the well water, in the feed, in the lambs' tissues.
[01:21:53.138 --> 01:21:53.799]  Got it published.
[01:21:54.880 --> 01:22:00.443]  And so I was kind of, kind of like a whistleblower back in 1962 as a result of that setting.
[01:22:01.415 --> 01:22:07.141]  And I was actually in Africa doing a big conservation project on the white rhino.
[01:22:07.201 --> 01:22:10.865]  I caught over 200 white rhino and sent them back to the United States.
[01:22:10.885 --> 01:22:17.071]  So if you ever go to a wild animal park or do anything to see a white rhino, it's either one that I caught or offsprings of the ones that I caught that have saved the species.
[01:22:17.471 --> 01:22:23.057]  While I was there doing that, Marlon Perkins from the old Mutual of Omaha Wild Kingdom show, I think you're probably familiar with him,
[01:22:24.585 --> 01:22:37.267]  He actually got the grant to do this autopsy study of zoo animals, looking for a species of zoo animal that would essentially be the canary in the mine, ultra-sensitive to pollution and would warn us of some impending pollution doom.
[01:22:38.228 --> 01:22:47.409]  And I did over 17,500 autopsies of over 454 species of zoo animals and 3,000 human beings, 10 million chemistries.
[01:22:47.489 --> 01:22:48.309]  It's all in this book.
[01:22:48.850 --> 01:22:50.310]  It's in the Smithsonian Institute.
[01:22:50.330 --> 01:22:51.350]  It's a national treasure.
[01:22:51.963 --> 01:22:55.525]  And that's the basic reason I was nominated for the Nobel Prize for that work.
[01:22:56.145 --> 01:23:08.810]  And I was the guy that did that study, and I was an abysmal failure at getting medical doctors interested in preventing and curing diseases in humans like we had in animals that did simple nutritional hormones.
[01:23:09.591 --> 01:23:19.075]  So I went back to school and became a naturopathic physician because they embrace nutrition and lifestyle change as opposed to medical doctors that just say, oh, eat fast food, you're going to get everything to eat, right?
[01:23:19.682 --> 01:23:25.385]  Until I went back to school and became a naturopathic physician in 1978.
[01:23:25.645 --> 01:23:26.225]  34 years now.
[01:23:26.926 --> 01:23:29.707]  I've been on the road giving 300 free lectures.
[01:23:30.407 --> 01:23:33.469]  The most popular of which was Dead Doctors Don't Lie.
[01:23:33.509 --> 01:23:35.990]  Next came A Deadly Recipe.
[01:23:36.590 --> 01:23:44.274]  And these lectures are my way of trying to communicate the warning to the general public that they have to take responsibility.
[01:23:45.077 --> 01:23:51.581]  And recently, and I'm glad you brought up a lot of the terrible things that were brought to light in November of last year.
[01:23:51.601 --> 01:23:55.924]  Just a couple of months ago, actually.
[01:23:56.044 --> 01:24:02.749]  One was, they said that, and this was the Department of Health and Human Services and the Census Bureau got together.
[01:24:02.769 --> 01:24:05.370]  They found out that medical doctors kill 11,000.
[01:24:05.411 --> 01:24:05.370]  11,000.
[01:24:05.431 --> 01:24:05.811]  11,000, Alex.
[01:24:11.998 --> 01:24:13.659]  People who are there on Medicare.
[01:24:13.859 --> 01:24:15.680]  Medicare patients, 11,000.
[01:24:16.420 --> 01:24:16.600]  No, 15,000.
[01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:19.321]  They're yelling at me, 15,000.
[01:24:19.821 --> 01:24:20.502]  15,000 per month.
[01:24:21.302 --> 01:24:26.544]  American Medicare patients are killed in hospitals by medical doctors each month for $180,000 per year.
[01:24:27.124 --> 01:24:28.665]  That's just one little slice of the public.
[01:24:29.606 --> 01:24:36.648]  And then, of course, the audio cassette tape, now CD, Deadly Recipe.
[01:24:36.668 --> 01:24:40.070]  1.5 million Americans are killed, injured by prescriptions.
[01:24:41.087 --> 01:24:42.609]  And they know this!
[01:24:42.749 --> 01:24:44.831]  I mean, here's a microcosm example.
[01:25:01.127 --> 01:25:21.220]  In the trials of Prozac, the big granddaddy of the serotonin reuptake inhibitor psychotropics, doctor as you know, they knew it massively increased psychotic outbreaks, artificial mental illness, suicidal tendencies, suicide, and it took decades up until just five years ago
[01:25:22.446 --> 01:25:23.667]  Oh, you're absolutely right.
[01:25:45.814 --> 01:25:46.275]  I don't know.
[01:26:03.752 --> 01:26:05.773]  Sure, I mean, I'm not even talking about the doctors.
[01:26:05.814 --> 01:26:25.327]  They're kind of given from on high, like Moses on the mountain, you know, fluoride's good for you, mercury's good for you, you know, all of this stuff is wonderful, you know, don't treat the cause, you know, treat the symptoms, but I mean, I'm talking about the American Medical Association and Big Pharma that owns it.
[01:26:25.887 --> 01:26:31.011]  Yes, well, you're exactly right, and of course, I mean, here's my example to support what you're saying.
[01:26:32.335 --> 01:26:45.085]  We can actually, in most cases, get rid of diabetes, type 2 diabetes, which right now, if you take in the pre-diabetic patients, you're looking at 90 million Americans, which is almost one-third of the population, has type 2 diabetes.
[01:26:45.605 --> 01:26:50.489]  We've known the cause, prevention, and cure of type 2 diabetes since 1957, 54 years.
[01:26:51.449 --> 01:26:53.571]  And I'm the only guy in the world who uses it.
[01:26:53.631 --> 01:26:57.554]  We get people routinely weaned off their medication, two or three days, sometimes a week.
[01:26:58.434 --> 01:27:09.943]  And they can have, even with injectable insulin, have blood sugars of 220, 240, and within 30 days they're down to blood sugars of 72, and they weaned off the medication and go back to normal life.
[01:27:09.963 --> 01:27:11.144]  Well, I mean, what about this, doctor?
[01:27:11.184 --> 01:27:26.676]  How about how they tell diabetic patients to drink soft drinks with aspartame, and I've had countless medical doctors on, breaking down the fact that that stuff absolutely decimates people that have diabetes.
[01:27:27.864 --> 01:27:28.985]  Well, yeah.
[01:27:29.045 --> 01:27:31.946]  First, aspartame is made out of amino acids.
[01:27:32.527 --> 01:27:35.449]  Actually, of course, it acts like sugar for a diabetic.
[01:27:35.509 --> 01:27:49.437]  It's just, they should not be consuming anything that has pure amino acids, or pure sugar, or agave syrup, or, you know, things you would think of as being healthy, whole grains, and even whole grain breads are bad for diabetics.
[01:27:49.797 --> 01:27:50.518]  Juices are bad.
[01:27:50.558 --> 01:27:51.318]  Fruits are bad.
[01:27:51.358 --> 01:27:56.401]  Doctors say, you know, carry around an orange, and if your blood sugar goes too low, eat a piece of fruit.
[01:27:56.441 --> 01:27:57.442]  Well, if you just eat nuts,
[01:27:58.306 --> 01:27:59.907]  If you're allergic to peanuts, eat the peanuts.
[01:27:59.947 --> 01:28:03.689]  I'd get mixed fancy nuts and eat mixed fancy nuts.
[01:28:04.629 --> 01:28:06.910]  The deluxe nuts.
[01:28:07.050 --> 01:28:12.893]  You'll have a regulated blood sugar that doesn't go way up and doesn't go way down.
[01:28:12.913 --> 01:28:16.275]  It actually comes down to the deficiency of a couple of trace minerals.
[01:28:18.255 --> 01:28:19.416]  Everybody takes them every day.
[01:28:19.436 --> 01:28:21.517]  That's why I like what we call the Mighty Nine.
[01:28:21.537 --> 01:28:23.438]  This is what we did in the animal industry, Alex.
[01:28:24.118 --> 01:28:25.119]  We give animals
[01:28:26.684 --> 01:28:27.785]  Well, Doc, I've got to stop you.
[01:28:27.805 --> 01:28:31.548]  I was really excited about this interview today, and we tried to get a different phone line.
[01:28:32.208 --> 01:28:37.512]  I really want to be able to understand you and hear you, but the line has just gone to where we can't understand you.
[01:28:37.772 --> 01:28:45.037]  I'm going to put you on hold, and I'm going to give you our number, and I'm going to see if you can get on with us for the rest of the hour, because this is such powerful information.
[01:28:45.398 --> 01:28:47.579]  I really want people to be able to hear it and understand it.
[01:28:48.420 --> 01:28:51.102]  We're going to work on that with Dr. Wallach.
[01:28:51.122 --> 01:28:53.043]  We may just have to have him back up next week.
[01:28:54.464 --> 01:28:59.108]  Because if I can't understand him, I can imagine some of you are having a problem, so I apologize to stations out there.
[01:28:59.328 --> 01:29:03.532]  I can hear a lot of it, but some of it I'm having to really strain, and this information is so important.
[01:29:04.112 --> 01:29:08.476]  I am really into doing things that I know can really help people.
[01:29:09.216 --> 01:29:16.783]  If you filter your water with the proper filtration systems, it's hard to find them, it's hard to cut fluoride out, you will have incredible health benefits.
[01:29:16.823 --> 01:29:18.824]  That's scores of medical doctors,
[01:29:19.745 --> 01:29:22.586]  Endocrinologists, brain surgeons, we've interviewed them all.
[01:29:22.626 --> 01:29:24.526]  We have literally hundreds and hundreds of studies.
[01:29:24.866 --> 01:29:25.566]  That's conservative.
[01:29:25.586 --> 01:29:27.067]  It's in the thousands, but I've looked at hundreds.
[01:29:27.647 --> 01:29:30.827]  That fluoride, sodium fluoride, hurts the thyroid, the whole body.
[01:29:31.307 --> 01:29:33.508]  And we've been beating this drum for years.
[01:29:33.808 --> 01:29:35.608]  The government's finally having to admit a bunch of this.
[01:29:36.229 --> 01:29:41.170]  Well, another big part of the equation is mineral deficiency and vitamin deficiency.
[01:29:41.290 --> 01:29:47.811]  And Dr. Wallach has got the documentation on this, and we can help a lot of people with this information.
[01:29:50.270 --> 01:29:53.271]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.191 --> 01:29:56.972]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.052 --> 01:30:01.653]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:30:01.693 --> 01:30:04.513]  You've heard me talk about Cal Bend 5 Star Soaps for years.

[01:30:21.361 --> 01:30:23.703]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[01:30:24.023 --> 01:30:30.229]  Since 1947, Calvin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[01:30:30.550 --> 01:30:31.951]  Buy American and stay clean.

[01:30:53.394 --> 01:30:53.834]  Thank you!
[01:30:59.568 --> 01:31:03.791]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:31:04.111 --> 01:31:04.392]  Number 1.
[01:31:05.032 --> 01:31:08.174]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:08.455 --> 01:31:09.015]  Number 2.
[01:31:09.315 --> 01:31:13.879]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:31:14.199 --> 01:31:14.659]  It's true.
[01:31:14.959 --> 01:31:19.503]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:19.823 --> 01:31:20.363]  Number 3.
[01:31:20.644 --> 01:31:23.926]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:31:24.226 --> 01:31:27.929]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:28.129 --> 01:31:28.690]  Number 4.
[01:31:28.930 --> 01:31:31.292]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:31:31.693 --> 01:31:35.076]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:31:35.377 --> 01:31:35.917]  Number 5.
[01:31:36.157 --> 01:31:40.082]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:31:40.322 --> 01:31:45.087]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:31:59.420 --> 01:32:03.062]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[01:32:03.242 --> 01:32:07.303]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[01:32:07.543 --> 01:32:12.565]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[01:32:12.665 --> 01:32:17.407]  Not looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[01:32:18.168 --> 01:32:25.191]  Not worried about them moving south, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[01:32:27.971 --> 01:32:32.336]  I'm looking for America.
[01:32:33.477 --> 01:32:34.878]  We're American and be proud.
[01:32:35.118 --> 01:32:37.641]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[01:32:37.721 --> 01:32:41.925]  The land of the free and the home of the brave.
[01:32:42.346 --> 01:32:45.989]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[01:32:53.914 --> 01:32:58.516]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[01:32:58.536 --> 01:33:03.998]  We are on the march.
[01:33:04.018 --> 01:33:05.619]  The empire is on the run.
[01:33:05.759 --> 01:33:08.960]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:19.608 --> 01:33:23.089]  Well, I've been really excited about interviewing Dr. Joel Wallach.
[01:33:23.109 --> 01:33:26.130]  Turns out he's on the road today, joining us via payphone.
[01:33:26.150 --> 01:33:28.331]  That explains the audio issues.
[01:33:28.351 --> 01:33:34.813]  But, again, I have researched this myself.
[01:33:34.833 --> 01:33:36.154]  I've just looked at the mainline studies.
[01:33:36.214 --> 01:33:45.637]  They know that many of the fields are played out, that much of the agriculture land we're using has been destroyed because of the chemical fertilizers.
[01:33:46.197 --> 01:33:47.198]  The establishment
[01:33:48.018 --> 01:33:49.459]  Knows and understands this.
[01:33:50.459 --> 01:33:53.620]  And they understand the mineral deficiencies we have.
[01:33:55.121 --> 01:33:57.042]  Dr. Wallach, give us your greatest hits.
[01:33:57.102 --> 01:34:01.604]  I mean, of all the research you've done, of what you understand, what are some of the biggest lies out there?
[01:34:01.624 --> 01:34:06.746]  And how do we reach out to people and warn them about what's happening?
[01:34:07.686 --> 01:34:13.909]  Okay, the biggest lies, Alex, are when you have a disease like type 2 diabetes, and doctors will say, oh, it's genetic.
[01:34:14.409 --> 01:34:15.790]  We just have to be able to deal with it.
[01:34:16.483 --> 01:34:24.927]  And they convince people that treating the symptom, the main symptom, of elevated blood sugar is the way to manage the disease and get maximum life.
[01:34:24.987 --> 01:34:26.247]  Well, that's not true.
[01:34:26.848 --> 01:34:32.730]  It's a very simple disease of what's called the insulin receptor site on the cell walls of all the trillions of cells in your body.
[01:34:32.750 --> 01:34:35.191]  It's kind of like turning off the breaker in the next room.
[01:34:35.231 --> 01:34:39.833]  You can plug in a $10 billion computer, and if the breaker is shut off in the other room, it ain't working.
[01:34:40.574 --> 01:34:42.635]  And the same thing is true with your insulin.
[01:34:42.735 --> 01:34:43.555]  Type 2 diabetics
[01:34:44.153 --> 01:34:45.194]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:35:08.135 --> 01:35:10.577]  Down to 72, so you've got to watch it.
[01:35:10.617 --> 01:35:18.821]  You have to take your blood sugar and adjust your insulin or your pills, so you don't get yourself into insulin shock, because your blood sugar will drop dramatically on this program.
[01:35:19.442 --> 01:35:23.284]  And people will ask me, well, how long do I have to stay on this nutritional program?
[01:35:23.544 --> 01:35:29.248]  For an average-sized person, Alex, it costs about $3 a day, about half the price of a cup of exotic coffee, right?
[01:35:30.208 --> 01:35:33.330]  And, well, as long as you're on oxygen, you will need
[01:35:33.996 --> 01:35:36.978]  These nutrients, as long as you're on water, you will need these nutrients.
[01:35:37.038 --> 01:35:40.559]  If you're dead and you're not taking oxygen and water, you don't need these nutrients.
[01:35:41.020 --> 01:35:45.142]  The reason why we're in trouble is we're deficient in these nutrients, as you pointed out so eloquently.
[01:35:45.162 --> 01:35:53.686]  Our fields are depleted because we're not repleting, we're not replenishing the minerals in our soil like we did in the old days.
[01:35:53.726 --> 01:35:55.867]  Our grandparents used to put minerals back in the soil.
[01:35:56.613 --> 01:35:57.755]  In the form of wood ashes.
[01:35:57.995 --> 01:36:01.080]  They would cook with wood stoves and heat with fireplaces and wood stoves.
[01:36:01.541 --> 01:36:03.544]  They would take the wood ashes, which are not carbon.
[01:36:03.584 --> 01:36:08.972]  They may have carbon in them, but basically wood ashes are the minerals that the trees sucked up out of the ground.
[01:36:09.545 --> 01:36:13.086]  And they are left over when you burn the carbon in the wood for fuel.
[01:36:13.726 --> 01:36:18.567]  And they used to put these wood ashes, aka plant minerals, into the soil of their gardens.
[01:36:19.007 --> 01:36:26.649]  And then the sweet potatoes and the squash and the tomatoes and beans and peas and corn and cucumbers and melons would pull these minerals up.
[01:36:26.669 --> 01:36:28.689]  You'd eat the food and you'd get the minerals in that fashion.
[01:36:29.450 --> 01:36:30.690]  Well, we don't do that anymore.
[01:36:30.970 --> 01:36:33.731]  And farmers do not get paid by how many minerals are in your food.
[01:36:33.751 --> 01:36:35.631]  They get paid by tons and bushels per acre.
[01:36:36.377 --> 01:36:44.102]  And so really, they're businessmen and they could care less about how many minerals are in the pasture for their livestock or how many minerals are in the hay or the feed they're giving their livestock.
[01:36:44.642 --> 01:36:47.764]  But as insurance, their insurance is different than ours.
[01:36:47.824 --> 01:36:58.731]  Instead of buying an insurance policy to pay the veterinarian when they screw up, their insurance policy is to give each individual animal, by hand, the minerals to ensure they get them.
[01:36:58.811 --> 01:37:00.312]  It's very efficient economically.
[01:37:00.332 --> 01:37:03.274]  They're not just throwing those minerals in the ground and hope the plant takes them up.
[01:37:03.655 --> 01:37:05.736]  They're actually giving them one by one to the animals.
[01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:16.431]  And one of the ways to monitor how good this is, is production of meat per pound of feed, production of eggs, production of milk per pound of feed, and also longevity.
[01:37:16.451 --> 01:37:21.818]  For instance, when you and I were kids, Alex, an old dog was 8 years old.
[01:37:21.878 --> 01:37:24.801]  Today an old dog is 25, and we didn't do that with Wonder Drugs.
[01:37:24.841 --> 01:37:25.542]  We didn't do that.
[01:37:26.498 --> 01:37:32.724]  With things like organ transplants and stem cells and deglutinant proteins.
[01:37:33.385 --> 01:37:36.027]  Basically what happened was we just put vitamins and minerals in our food.
[01:37:36.428 --> 01:37:37.889]  The same thing is true for diabetes.
[01:37:38.890 --> 01:37:48.319]  And this is true, and I'm just saying, what if the entire city of Austin were to listen to us today and say, okay, we're going to make Austin the first diabetes-free city.
[01:37:49.079 --> 01:37:50.861]  And it's doable within a couple of weeks.
[01:37:51.380 --> 01:38:09.060]  Everybody would take the 90th Century Nutrients, the Alex Pack if you will, the Alex Pack, the 90th Century Nutrients, and then throw in what we call the Sweeties, which is the secret sauce for diabetes, and take their blood sugar like they're supposed to, and it'll come down to wean off their medication, and Austin would be a
[01:38:10.934 --> 01:38:12.477]  Diabetes free city in a couple of weeks.
[01:38:23.368 --> 01:38:24.089]  I don't know.
[01:38:46.127 --> 01:38:49.229]  Large animal husbandry for those three summers.
[01:38:49.789 --> 01:38:51.531]  I mean, it was all about that.
[01:38:52.031 --> 01:38:56.754]  And so much of it was, you know, you need to put them on this feed or you need to give them this block.
[01:38:57.234 --> 01:38:59.316]  And I've got family that ranches.
[01:38:59.356 --> 01:39:00.276]  They all know that.
[01:39:00.616 --> 01:39:03.578]  So this isn't some big secret for veterinarians.
[01:39:03.658 --> 01:39:07.461]  Of course, you're a veterinarian and also a naturopathic doctor.
[01:39:08.301 --> 01:39:15.086]  So again, why aren't Americans who are having all these degenerative diseases and problems and
[01:39:16.531 --> 01:39:17.511]  Things like diabetes.
[01:39:17.591 --> 01:39:18.872]  Why aren't they being told this?
[01:39:19.732 --> 01:39:24.794]  Well, you have to appreciate that a doctor is not required by law to cure you when there's a cure available.
[01:39:25.874 --> 01:39:28.315]  And this is the first thing I would do if I was ever appointed.
[01:39:28.335 --> 01:39:33.116]  When you get to be president, Alex, I want to be your first surgeon general.
[01:39:33.136 --> 01:39:38.598]  I want to do the law that every doctor should be curing people when there's cures available.
[01:39:38.658 --> 01:39:42.019]  Otherwise, they go to jail for 25 years of life without possibility of parole.
[01:39:42.868 --> 01:39:48.450]  And since her average lifespan for doctors is 56, none of them will ever get out of jail, so I like that part.
[01:39:49.070 --> 01:39:59.894]  The reason why, for instance, it usually takes, depending on their body weight, 3 to 5 hours a day to get people to wean off their medication when they have diabetes and go back to a normal life.
[01:40:00.334 --> 01:40:02.995]  Can't legally use the cure word, so that's why I'm saying it the way I'm saying it.
[01:40:06.654 --> 01:40:26.184]  By option, the alternative is if they treat people and teach them how to use insulin or pills to manage their blood sugar, which is a meaningless process, because elevated blood sugar is not the disease, it's a symptom of the disease, the doctor will make, the average family doctor who diagnoses it usually, will make $750,000.
[01:40:26.224 --> 01:40:28.205]  So you compare $300 and $750,000, which way are they going to go?
[01:40:32.349 --> 01:40:33.670]  Now let's break that down.
[01:40:34.832 --> 01:40:36.754]  And of course the average doctor is just busy.
[01:40:36.914 --> 01:40:45.423]  They're just following what the American Medical Association says and they subconsciously go along with it because it's profitable and they've got all these bills and the rest of it.
[01:40:46.161 --> 01:40:55.645]  But doctor, how does it work, and again we're talking to Dr. Joel Wallach, how does it work down at the cellular level?
[01:40:56.065 --> 01:41:09.570]  How does not having all the trace elements and minerals and things that you need, how does that just in the one area of diabetes that we're talking about, and there's so many other areas, that we cover at InfoWarsTeam.com, one place to find all this information.
[01:41:09.610 --> 01:41:15.313]  We've got your free audio there, we're gonna add a video of this show today there, at InfoWarsTeam.com.
[01:41:16.553 --> 01:41:24.138]  Dr. Wallach, expanding on that, how does this interact at the cellular level, not having these minerals and nutrients, and what are those minerals and nutrients?
[01:41:25.018 --> 01:41:32.903]  Okay, well, first of all, we need that basic 90 essential nutrients, the 60 minerals, 16 vitamins, 12 essential amino acids, and 3 essential fatty acids.
[01:41:33.444 --> 01:41:34.884]  That's the basic Alex Pack.
[01:41:34.904 --> 01:41:38.126]  This is the platform that everybody needs just to prevent disease.
[01:41:38.186 --> 01:41:39.787]  I mean, I'm going on to 72 here.
[01:41:39.847 --> 01:41:40.548]  I've been taking this
[01:41:41.315 --> 01:41:42.276]  I don't think so.
[01:42:03.761 --> 01:42:15.429]  I've been taking the 90 essential nutrients since I was 9 years old and the whole purpose of that, Alex, is to do what we do for our cars.
[01:42:15.469 --> 01:42:18.351]  For instance, we put oil in our cars before the engine burns up.
[01:42:18.452 --> 01:42:26.097]  If you have an expensive car like a Cadillac or a Bentley or a Mercedes or something, you change oil every thousand miles or every month whether you drive it or not.
[01:42:26.790 --> 01:42:32.053]  And so, to prevent the engine from burning up, get an extra 300,000 miles in distance.
[01:42:32.093 --> 01:42:33.313]  Well, the same thing is true for us.
[01:42:34.034 --> 01:42:42.418]  People get all in a panic once they get fibromyalgia, and lupus, and diabetes, and arthritis, and all the doctors say they've got to get a double knee replacement tomorrow.
[01:42:43.038 --> 01:42:43.879]  I'm already scheduled.
[01:42:44.379 --> 01:42:49.602]  Well, cancel the darn surgeries and give me 30 days and we'll rebuild the cartilage in your knees.
[01:42:50.042 --> 01:42:51.023]  It's that simple.
[01:42:51.083 --> 01:42:53.724]  It's just you need that platform of the 90th century nutrients.
[01:42:53.764 --> 01:42:55.545]  Now, once somebody has a full-blown disease,
[01:42:56.283 --> 01:43:01.026]  Like diabetes, you have to add some of the secret sauce back in, which is, as you point out, not secret.
[01:43:02.007 --> 01:43:08.752]  In the case of diabetes, it's two trace minerals called chromium and vanadium.
[01:43:09.352 --> 01:43:13.836]  Now, if you just take chromium and vanadium by themselves, you would drop your blood sugar, say, from 220 to maybe 200.
[01:43:13.936 --> 01:43:17.718]  Not very dramatic, and people say, well, I can do that just by not eating fruit.
[01:43:18.259 --> 01:43:21.401]  And so, why should I take those things if I'm paying it out of my own pocket?
[01:43:21.441 --> 01:43:22.602]  Insurance is not paying for it.
[01:43:22.642 --> 01:43:24.243]  The government's not paying for it.
[01:43:24.623 --> 01:43:25.244]  Why should I do it?
[01:43:25.979 --> 01:43:37.009]  That's because when the research is done in animals, the animals are getting their basic laboratory rat, guinea pig, rabbit, or monkey pellets with all the nutrients in it, and they just leave out the one.
[01:43:37.049 --> 01:43:42.113]  They would leave out chromium or vanadium, or both chromium and vanadium, but all the other 90 essential nutrients are going to have in there.
[01:43:43.054 --> 01:43:47.958]  Whereas the average American doesn't have many of those 90 essential nutrients.
[01:43:47.978 --> 01:43:50.761]  They might be banging along in 12, or 15, and be 65 short.
[01:43:53.729 --> 01:43:55.329]  And so that's a big, huge problem.
[01:43:55.349 --> 01:43:58.190]  So when you take the chromium vanadium, nothing dramatic happens.
[01:43:58.870 --> 01:44:04.552]  So that's why they have to take the Alex pack as a basic nutrient platform.
[01:44:04.592 --> 01:44:10.633]  So basically it's almost like an adjuvant from talking to medical doctors and scientists and brain surgeons on this subject.
[01:44:10.993 --> 01:44:13.754]  Fluoride is something that accelerates
[01:44:15.106 --> 01:44:21.814]  All of the other toxic things that are in you and almost gives it an acceleration effect or an amplifying effect.
[01:44:22.035 --> 01:44:28.422]  You're saying all the minerals and vitamins together, they have an amplifying effect because you need them all together.
[01:44:28.502 --> 01:44:33.608]  And to be quite frank, why Dr. Wallach is here and why I've approached him to have him on and to work with him.
[01:44:34.938 --> 01:44:43.744]  I was a health nut, and by health nut, running six miles almost every day, lifting weights, super good shape, 2% body fat when I was like 22.
[01:44:44.204 --> 01:44:53.230]  I got into radio, fighting the globalists, just quit working out, obsessed on it, eating unhealthy, and now for about three years, I've quit most of the unhealthy stuff, in fact, all of it.
[01:44:53.610 --> 01:44:59.994]  I've been running, I've been lifting weights, I've been eating less, but still, I haven't felt good.
[01:45:00.014 --> 01:45:02.156]  And now, in the last few months, I was doing research
[01:45:03.696 --> 01:45:09.498]  With Mike Adams and with Dr. Wallach and with so many other people looking at their material, studying the actual documents.
[01:45:09.938 --> 01:45:13.478]  And I really came up with the fact that I'm going to really announce this here today.
[01:45:13.498 --> 01:45:14.779]  I haven't even told Dr. Wallach this.
[01:45:15.359 --> 01:45:17.579]  And now I'm doing it publicly so I've got to put up or shut up.
[01:45:17.939 --> 01:45:21.140]  Last year I said I'd lose 50 pounds, I only lost 25.
[01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:26.061]  I want to lose at least 40 pounds in this next year.
[01:45:26.141 --> 01:45:27.522]  That's my pledge.
[01:45:28.002 --> 01:45:28.962]  That's my resolution.
[01:45:29.802 --> 01:45:34.946]  Uh, and, and, and doing the research, it's not enough to go jogging in the morning or lift weights or even eat less.
[01:45:35.166 --> 01:45:41.050]  I have got, and I'm somebody who's never taken vitamins in my life, even when I played football, I've now gotten these products.
[01:45:41.551 --> 01:45:44.333]  I'm going to start them next week and we're going to see what happens.
[01:45:45.073 --> 01:45:50.436]  But from all the research I've read, if I don't want my hair to go gray, which is all of a sudden starting to happen, I've got to get the nutrients.
[01:45:50.516 --> 01:45:58.521]  Even if I try to eat healthy, and my wife makes all sorts of vegetables and things, it's hard to get all of these things together, and that's what we need.
[01:45:58.641 --> 01:46:04.485]  And I just think back to vets that I work for, obsessed with vitamins and minerals.
[01:46:05.045 --> 01:46:06.786]  And this is something the old-timers all knew.
[01:46:06.826 --> 01:46:11.709]  As Dr. Wallach said, he just discovered it in his own research, and has now helped so many people.
[01:46:12.310 --> 01:46:13.711]  And it's just...
[01:46:14.662 --> 01:46:17.683]  It's so fundamental to get this message out to people.
[01:46:17.924 --> 01:46:20.285]  That's why we've created InfoWarsTeam.com.
[01:46:20.425 --> 01:46:22.626]  We're going to be adding banners up there.
[01:46:22.666 --> 01:46:23.466]  We've got free audio.
[01:46:23.486 --> 01:46:26.928]  We're going to be adding a bunch of video, a bunch of free material on this.
[01:46:27.668 --> 01:46:33.130]  But also, very inexpensively priced, big line of things for full spectrum.
[01:46:33.671 --> 01:46:36.132]  And what Dr. Wallach has developed over
[01:46:37.028 --> 01:46:38.309]  The last, I don't know, 30, 40 years.
[01:46:38.329 --> 01:46:39.369]  I don't know how long he's been doing it.
[01:46:40.090 --> 01:46:43.472]  It's just so amazing, and I do believe in this.
[01:46:43.492 --> 01:46:46.593]  Just like I believed in silver when it was $5 an ounce, and now it's almost $30.
[01:46:46.633 --> 01:46:52.177]  Just like I believed in gold when it was $260 an ounce, now it's right up at $1,400.
[01:46:52.837 --> 01:46:54.078]  I mean, I've done my research.
[01:46:54.778 --> 01:46:59.301]  Just like I bought storable foods three or four places and finally found a good place and that's who my sponsor is.
[01:46:59.742 --> 01:47:02.244]  I've done my research and now I found Dr. Walling.
[01:47:02.504 --> 01:47:12.652]  I've known him about him for 15 years but I just went through my research because now I'm gonna try to go on a health kick and we're gonna see right now what happens with the full line of Longevity products.
[01:47:13.112 --> 01:47:20.898]  All discounted right there at InfoWarsTeam.com and when you sign up there you then get to get discounts on it.
[01:47:21.338 --> 01:47:22.318]  You can sign others up.
[01:47:22.338 --> 01:47:29.201]  This is a great way to create community organizations, to educate people, and in the free market, profit from helping people.
[01:47:29.461 --> 01:47:35.563]  Tell folks about what they can do by signing up or getting involved at InfoWarsTeam.com, Dr. Wallach.
[01:47:36.484 --> 01:47:40.185]  Well, Alex, first of all, they're going to be able to get these products at wholesale.
[01:47:40.848 --> 01:47:41.128]  I don't
[01:48:01.681 --> 01:48:10.745]  Whereas, when you get something off the shelf of a grocery store or pharmacy, these, you know, one-a-day, multiple kind of things, you're looking at 20% of the minimum data requirement.
[01:48:10.805 --> 01:48:13.346]  And so this is why people tend to be in a downward spiral.
[01:48:14.006 --> 01:48:20.869]  Also, for a one-time $10 fee, for one time, I believe it's a $10 fee, you get a business.
[01:48:21.049 --> 01:48:22.450]  And we will train you for nothing.
[01:48:23.130 --> 01:48:23.850]  We will train people.
[01:48:23.870 --> 01:48:26.731]  We do conference calls, webinars.
[01:48:26.751 --> 01:48:28.412]  We have regional and national meetings.
[01:48:28.860 --> 01:48:29.480]  Local meetings.
[01:48:30.161 --> 01:48:39.187]  And they can not only help themselves with their health, the people they love, they can generate an income stream, have a tax-deductible business, which is a willable asset.
[01:48:39.207 --> 01:48:40.949]  This is the part that I love, Alex.
[01:48:41.509 --> 01:48:49.175]  You can work for a company for 40 years, be the best employee they have, the go-to person to fill in when somebody's not there, or train the new people.
[01:48:50.135 --> 01:48:51.636]  You're the one they give the overtime to.
[01:48:51.716 --> 01:48:56.620]  When you retire or die, you cannot will or sell your job to your heirs.
[01:48:57.301 --> 01:48:59.463]  But your longevity business, you can do that.
[01:48:59.983 --> 01:49:03.185]  We're very, very excited about our association with you because you're going to get the word out.
[01:49:03.786 --> 01:49:09.209]  And in this economy, we're going to help people stay away from doctors by keeping them healthy before they get sick.
[01:49:09.610 --> 01:49:16.334]  We're going to help people cancel those double knee replacement surgeries and let us help them rebuild their
[01:49:17.637 --> 01:49:21.359]  We're going to help rebuild cartilage, ligaments, tenons, connective tissue, bone.
[01:49:21.859 --> 01:49:22.319]  It's doable.
[01:49:22.359 --> 01:49:25.281]  We do it with professional athletes and military personnel all the time.
[01:49:25.681 --> 01:49:27.062]  We do it with people with firemen.
[01:49:27.102 --> 01:49:30.063]  Because minerals and vitamins are what we're made up of.
[01:49:30.524 --> 01:49:31.484]  That's exactly right.
[01:49:31.584 --> 01:49:32.625]  And it's real simple.
[01:49:32.665 --> 01:49:37.407]  And so many of the vitamins I see on store shelves, doctor, as you know, it's synthetic versions.
[01:49:38.148 --> 01:49:41.049]  You guys actually have the raw, true vitamins and minerals.
[01:49:41.109 --> 01:49:42.450]  Explain to people briefly the difference.
[01:49:43.274 --> 01:49:47.856]  Well, the difference is everything we have comes from plants and bacterial fermentation.
[01:49:48.956 --> 01:49:50.397]  Grinding up rocks doesn't count.
[01:49:50.717 --> 01:49:54.579]  For instance, if you have saltwater source of minerals, which is a liquid mineral.
[01:49:54.779 --> 01:49:57.600]  We love liquids because they're easily absorbable.
[01:49:57.640 --> 01:50:03.042]  You only get 985 milligrams of minerals from saltwater, whether it's the Great Salt Lake or the oceans around the world.
[01:50:04.168 --> 01:50:08.112]  And ours are from a certified organic plant source.
[01:50:08.152 --> 01:50:14.157]  So this plant compost, if you will, has been certified organic every year for 35 years.
[01:50:14.177 --> 01:50:20.623]  You can actually see the... It's a biological source, so it's ready to be sucked up by your body.
[01:50:20.663 --> 01:50:21.143]  It's living.
[01:50:21.644 --> 01:50:22.244]  It's living.
[01:50:22.304 --> 01:50:25.848]  It's already been pre-digested by the plants, and so you don't have to do that.
[01:50:26.772 --> 01:50:29.994]  We're going to give you 19,000 milligrams per quart.
[01:50:30.014 --> 01:50:33.356]  20 times what you get, and ours is cheaper than everybody else's.
[01:50:33.796 --> 01:50:34.216]  Amazing!
[01:50:34.276 --> 01:50:36.657]  It's InfoWarsTeam.com.
[01:50:37.018 --> 01:50:38.158]  The site's loading slowly.
[01:50:38.178 --> 01:50:38.939]  A lot of folks on there.
[01:50:38.979 --> 01:50:40.760]  InfoWarsTeam.com.
[01:50:41.180 --> 01:50:48.044]  Over the years, I've been approached by a lot of folks to promote, you know, these team organization things, and I just couldn't totally certify or believe in it.
[01:50:48.524 --> 01:50:49.745]  This, I do believe in.
[01:50:50.145 --> 01:50:51.386]  Infowarsteam.com.
[01:50:51.766 --> 01:50:55.449]  Get involved right here on the ground floor today, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:55.469 --> 01:50:57.810]  We'll come back with the final segment with Dr. Wallach.
[01:51:00.232 --> 01:51:01.493]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:01.533 --> 01:51:06.876]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.116 --> 01:51:11.739]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:12.140 --> 01:51:12.540]  It's true.
[01:51:12.620 --> 01:51:15.202]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[01:51:15.422 --> 01:51:17.183]  And it's possible that it could even happen again.
[01:51:17.703 --> 01:51:22.406]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:22.927 --> 01:51:24.848]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:51:25.248 --> 01:51:29.851]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:30.051 --> 01:51:30.952]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:31.172 --> 01:51:33.934]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:51:34.214 --> 01:51:37.516]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:37.857 --> 01:51:40.698]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:51:41.039 --> 01:51:42.940]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:51:43.260 --> 01:51:44.201]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:51:47.823 --> 01:51:51.524]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:52.065 --> 01:51:56.566]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:56.886 --> 01:51:59.347]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:51:59.867 --> 01:52:02.328]  Going solar for cheap is as easy as 1-2-3.
[01:52:02.788 --> 01:52:05.389]  If you want to go solar but thought the setup costs were too high,
[01:52:05.609 --> 01:52:08.250]  Now you can build your own solar panels for less than $200.
[01:52:08.910 --> 01:52:09.530]  Don't laugh!
[01:52:09.671 --> 01:52:12.412]  We've sold over 45,000 solar do-it-yourself kits.

[01:52:29.418 --> 01:52:30.480]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:52:30.660 --> 01:52:35.047]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:52:35.207 --> 01:52:40.956]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:52:41.036 --> 01:52:44.422]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:52:44.662 --> 01:52:47.263]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:52:47.384 --> 01:52:52.286]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:52:52.446 --> 01:52:53.187]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:52:55.288 --> 01:52:56.769]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:52:56.909 --> 01:53:02.432]  There's a man named Dr. Wallach, who is anything but your typical doctor.
[01:53:02.812 --> 01:53:05.874]  Both a veterinarian and naturopathic physician, Doc asks,
[01:53:06.434 --> 01:53:13.204]  Why does the United States spend more money on health care by far and still rank 50th in health and longevity worldwide?
[01:53:13.585 --> 01:53:22.738]  He believes that people should empower themselves with a basic understanding of nutrition, taking charge of their life, and attain optimal health and longevity through nutrition.
[01:53:23.158 --> 01:53:26.119]  Not by toxic prescription drugs, leading to side effects.
[01:53:26.399 --> 01:53:28.040]  This is clearly a deadly recipe.
[01:53:28.380 --> 01:53:37.623]  The good news is, Doc Wallach's message is resonating with an increasing number of Americans who are waking up to all the big government and big pharma manipulation of our healthcare system.
[01:53:37.943 --> 01:53:45.206]  I like what Doc Wallach is saying and doing to enlighten people about healthcare, and have joined forces to help this tireless crusader spread his message.
[01:53:45.686 --> 01:53:46.447]  We're good to go.
[01:54:05.396 --> 01:54:10.780]  Okay, we're going to have open phones next hour with Bob Chapman and I. I'm going to go over a wide spectrum of news.
[01:54:11.440 --> 01:54:13.422]  Oil set to go up to $100 a barrel.
[01:54:13.942 --> 01:54:15.843]  We told you so three months ago.
[01:54:15.863 --> 01:54:18.405]  We're going to get Lindsey Williams back on next week, by the way.
[01:54:19.346 --> 01:54:23.049]  We're going to get into Mexican gunman fires across the border towards U.S.
[01:54:23.129 --> 01:54:23.929]  highway workers.
[01:54:24.449 --> 01:54:27.231]  I see this kind of stuff every week, but the media is playing it down.
[01:54:28.332 --> 01:54:32.697]  We're also going to get into a report out of AFP.
[01:54:33.097 --> 01:54:35.660]  Freedom is in decline worldwide, U.S.
[01:54:35.740 --> 01:54:36.661]  report states.
[01:54:39.604 --> 01:54:43.789]  So our own government's admitting freedom is plunging worldwide, but talking about other countries.
[01:54:44.129 --> 01:54:44.970]  What about here?
[01:54:45.908 --> 01:54:51.409]  So that's all coming up as well, but open phones at 800-259-9231.
[01:54:51.469 --> 01:54:53.950]  Well, Dr. Wallach, I appreciate you coming on while you're out on the road.
[01:54:53.970 --> 01:54:59.671]  I look forward, when you're back in the office in the next few weeks, getting you on the broadcast.
[01:55:00.311 --> 01:55:08.993]  And absolutely, I hope people get involved in this because I only promote and push what I believe in and what I think will help people.
[01:55:09.913 --> 01:55:14.557]  And folks can judge by our track record if I have good judgment, but people make their own judgment.
[01:55:15.158 --> 01:55:34.295]  I am going to start on the regimen of the basic products that you've developed that are mineral and vitamin based and all natural because it's full spectrum and I've done the research and you're the only organization or group that I've found that that fits in with the separate research I've done and what I learned working for
[01:55:35.598 --> 01:55:37.199]  I don't think so.
[01:56:01.681 --> 01:56:04.483]  This is all about the products, just absolutely amazing.
[01:56:04.963 --> 01:56:07.964]  There's quite a few of them up there on the site at infowarsteam.com.
[01:56:08.385 --> 01:56:20.171]  In the time we have left, Dr. Joel Wallach, other key tidbits, other things that mineral and vitamin and trace element deficiencies are triggering and causing.
[01:56:20.411 --> 01:56:27.015]  I know it's not just hair falling out and gray hair and bad fingernails and bad skin and, you know, on the inside it's causing problems, isn't it?
[01:56:27.762 --> 01:56:28.624]  Yes, you're exactly right.
[01:56:28.644 --> 01:56:33.615]  When you have gray hair, you're also getting a breakdown of the elastic fibers in your arteries and your blood vessels.
[01:56:33.635 --> 01:56:37.283]  You're going to get spider veins, varicose veins, hemorrhoids, ruptured aneurysms.
[01:56:38.147 --> 01:56:44.709]  Uh, even, um, uh, Albert Einstein died at age 76 of a ruptured aortic aneurysm, which is a simple copper deficiency.
[01:56:45.229 --> 01:56:48.110]  And, of course, it also causes white hair, which he was legendary for.
[01:56:48.770 --> 01:56:57.553]  And then, um, you can also, you're gonna get, um, with the deficiencies of these trace minerals, you're gonna get bone-to-bone arthritis, for which the medical system has joint replacement surgeries.
[01:56:58.453 --> 01:57:09.977]  Doctors are screaming for an epidemic of arthritis coming here because there are 80 million baby boomers coming along and medical doctors have convinced them not to take vitamins and minerals and as a result they are all breaking down.
[01:57:09.997 --> 01:57:20.240]  What I tell people, Alex, is to cancel your scheduled double knee replacement or double hip replacement or your low back surgery.
[01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:31.772]  Give us, give Alex Pack and the Extra Glucogel, which is the secret sauce to supporting and promoting maintenance, repair of cartilage, ligaments, tendons, connective tissue, discs between the vertebrae.
[01:57:32.133 --> 01:57:32.914]  Give us two months!
[01:57:33.687 --> 01:57:37.270]  And if you still think you need your surgery, you can always get the surgery.
[01:57:37.290 --> 01:57:38.732]  But you can't always get undead.
[01:57:39.392 --> 01:57:44.256]  And so there's always a tremendous risk with surgery from infection, amputations, paralysis.
[01:57:44.556 --> 01:57:49.801]  I've had one surgery and they almost killed me in Dallas when I was 16 for a broken leg.
[01:57:50.141 --> 01:57:51.663]  And I've got a hernia.
[01:57:52.003 --> 01:57:54.225]  And I won't go in for surgery because I'm afraid they'll kill me.
[01:57:54.813 --> 01:57:55.113]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:57:55.133 --> 01:57:56.295]  You don't want to go in for a surgery.
[01:57:56.715 --> 01:57:58.897]  They are the instrument of the bad guys.
[01:57:59.237 --> 01:58:00.138]  You still want to go in there.
[01:58:00.459 --> 01:58:01.720]  Believe me, believe me.
[01:58:01.920 --> 01:58:03.682]  Listen, they tested my blood.
[01:58:03.702 --> 01:58:06.124]  I'm going to hold you over for five more minutes, Dr. Walker, if you can do it.
[01:58:06.144 --> 01:58:08.467]  And then we're going to get Bob Chapman on, because I want to tell this story.
[01:58:08.707 --> 01:58:09.788]  I'll start telling it now.
[01:58:10.609 --> 01:58:11.530]  My leg gets broken.
[01:58:12.411 --> 01:58:13.812]  The bone's almost sticking out of the meat.
[01:58:14.152 --> 01:58:15.193]  They tell me you need a pin.
[01:58:16.665 --> 01:58:17.865]  I go in and have the surgery.
[01:58:18.225 --> 01:58:20.546]  After the surgery, they came in and they said, we tested your blood.
[01:58:20.626 --> 01:58:22.766]  You don't have any opiates in your body.
[01:58:22.786 --> 01:58:24.807]  You're not a heroin user.
[01:58:24.847 --> 01:58:25.907]  There's no drugs in your blood.
[01:58:25.927 --> 01:58:29.768]  But it took nine times the regular amount to put you under.
[01:58:29.968 --> 01:58:31.548]  I kept waking up on the operating table.
[01:58:31.928 --> 01:58:34.449]  Then after that, they didn't put the IV in right.
[01:58:34.469 --> 01:58:35.749]  I woke up with blood all over me.
[01:58:36.049 --> 01:58:36.909]  It was a nightmare.
[01:58:37.009 --> 01:58:39.090]  I do not want to ever go in for surgery again.
[01:58:39.950 --> 01:58:43.136]  Are you tired of searching for great talk radio?
[01:58:43.156 --> 01:58:44.479]  Something more important.
[01:58:44.599 --> 01:58:45.941]  Search no more.
[01:58:46.102 --> 01:58:49.548]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:50.282 --> 01:58:53.604]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[01:58:53.864 --> 01:58:54.945]  It ended on June of 2009.
[01:58:55.165 --> 01:58:59.368]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[01:58:59.568 --> 01:59:05.212]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[01:59:05.512 --> 01:59:07.493]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[01:59:07.653 --> 01:59:10.335]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[01:59:10.695 --> 01:59:16.998]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[01:59:17.179 --> 01:59:19.000]  They both make fabulous investments.
[01:59:19.400 --> 01:59:24.462]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[01:59:24.743 --> 01:59:29.725]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[01:59:30.025 --> 01:59:35.228]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[01:59:35.388 --> 01:59:38.330]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[01:59:38.570 --> 01:59:41.552]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[01:59:41.572 --> 01:59:42.332]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[02:00:04.724 --> 02:00:08.907]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:09.568 --> 02:00:10.368]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.149 --> 02:00:13.050]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.070 --> 02:00:16.333]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.893 --> 02:00:20.956]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:21.997 --> 02:00:23.940]  Dr. Joel Wallach is our guest.
[02:00:23.980 --> 02:00:26.803]  We've teamed up to bring you InfoWarsTeam.com.
[02:00:28.105 --> 02:00:29.807]  He's got free audio files there.
[02:00:29.827 --> 02:00:33.251]  We're going to be adding video files there to the site over the weekend.
[02:00:33.952 --> 02:00:35.173]  InfoWarsTeam.com.
[02:00:35.333 --> 02:00:37.276]  I'm inviting all my listeners to get involved.
[02:00:37.936 --> 02:00:38.237]  What is it?
[02:00:38.257 --> 02:00:38.557]  $9.95 to sign up.
[02:00:40.319 --> 02:00:48.202]  Then you get upwards of 30 to 40 percent discounts on these wonderful vitamin and mineral and nutrient drinks, powders, you name it.
[02:00:48.242 --> 02:00:49.443]  It's just amazing products.
[02:00:49.883 --> 02:00:51.084]  I'm going on a mall next week.
[02:00:51.124 --> 02:00:51.904]  I've done the research.
[02:00:52.304 --> 02:00:54.005]  I've chosen this product line.
[02:00:54.325 --> 02:00:56.286]  And what I'm into is what I promote to you.
[02:00:56.706 --> 02:00:58.627]  If I'm doing it, I tell you about it.
[02:00:59.227 --> 02:01:00.529]  It's real simple, okay?
[02:01:00.889 --> 02:01:02.251]  I do what I believe in.
[02:01:02.391 --> 02:01:04.294]  I walk the walk, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:01:04.695 --> 02:01:05.696]  I don't just talk the talk.
[02:01:06.497 --> 02:01:08.219]  And so you get huge discounts right there.
[02:01:08.239 --> 02:01:10.983]  You're able to buy the products, able to get others signed up and sell it to them.
[02:01:11.564 --> 02:01:14.348]  And this is how we defeat the globalists, is through the free market.
[02:01:15.618 --> 02:01:17.099]  Again, liberty is popular.
[02:01:17.159 --> 02:01:18.679]  The truth and health is popular.
[02:01:19.119 --> 02:01:20.200]  And I've done the analysis.
[02:01:20.260 --> 02:01:22.741]  The only thing I've got missing is that I am nutrient deficient.
[02:01:23.181 --> 02:01:24.862]  I haven't went a month ago and had my blood tested.
[02:01:25.202 --> 02:01:27.443]  Okay, now going back to Dr. Wallach, because we're almost out of time.
[02:01:28.523 --> 02:01:32.725]  I was telling that story, and you talk about dead doctors don't lie.
[02:01:32.745 --> 02:01:34.346]  That's the name of your radio program.
[02:01:35.455 --> 02:01:36.896]  And that's absolutely accurate.
[02:01:37.856 --> 02:01:40.757]  The guy that did my surgery was supposedly this great doctor in Dallas.
[02:01:40.777 --> 02:01:41.577]  He was a nice guy.
[02:01:42.197 --> 02:01:43.698]  He was a former NFL lineman.
[02:01:44.258 --> 02:01:45.219]  And he was a big guy.
[02:01:45.259 --> 02:01:47.079]  I think he was less than 50 years old.
[02:01:47.679 --> 02:01:48.640]  And he did the surgery.
[02:01:48.680 --> 02:01:52.661]  And then I called four weeks later and said I need to get scheduled to have the pin taken out.
[02:01:52.861 --> 02:01:53.902]  I still got the pin, by the way.
[02:01:54.262 --> 02:01:56.002]  And they said, well, the doctor's had a huge heart attack.
[02:01:56.042 --> 02:01:56.843]  He's down at the coast.
[02:01:57.923 --> 02:01:59.104]  Uh, and he may be retired.
[02:01:59.644 --> 02:02:03.365]  And I called back a few months later and said, is he able to remove the pin or do I get a new doctor to do it?
[02:02:03.726 --> 02:02:05.206]  They said, we're sorry, the doctor has died.
[02:02:05.806 --> 02:02:08.147]  And he wasn't even, if I remember, wasn't even 50 yet.
[02:02:08.828 --> 02:02:14.070]  Uh, so, uh, you talk about the statistics, and I've seen them, of medical doctors, dentists, you name it.
[02:02:14.110 --> 02:02:18.772]  I mean, these people, how are we listening to anything they say when they've got very low life expectancies?
[02:02:19.414 --> 02:02:27.357]  You're exactly right, Alex, and this is why we came up with the Alex Pack, so that the average American can live to be well beyond 100 chronologically, yet be biologically 30.
[02:02:27.417 --> 02:02:31.379]  The average medical doctor, according to their own research, Alex, is 56.
[02:02:32.079 --> 02:02:36.381]  Why would we listen to a bunch of guys whose average lifespan is 56 how to live to be 100?
[02:02:36.441 --> 02:02:42.024]  They die from cancer, diabetes, heart attack, heart stroke, all the things we want to prevent that are pure.
[02:02:42.064 --> 02:02:42.804]  Why do we go to them?
[02:02:43.468 --> 02:02:54.521]  It's madness, and so I really, really appreciate our alliance here, and your ability to communicate is just going to be enormous in saving America from the medical system by getting them on a healthy program.
[02:02:55.203 --> 02:02:56.944]  If you don't get sick, you don't need a doctor.
[02:02:57.005 --> 02:03:00.968]  You don't need a doctor if you get sick anyway, but... Well, Dr. Wally, that is my plan.
[02:03:00.988 --> 02:03:02.149]  That's why I reached out to you.
[02:03:02.369 --> 02:03:03.149]  So I did the research.
[02:03:03.209 --> 02:03:03.690]  I knew who you were.
[02:03:03.710 --> 02:03:11.035]  I'd interviewed you before, just as a guest, and I thought this was the guy to team up with, and I'm honored to be working with you, because it's very, very simple.
[02:03:11.576 --> 02:03:12.597]  It's just like fluoride.
[02:03:12.617 --> 02:03:15.079]  They're now admitting that sodium fluoride is so toxic to the body.
[02:03:15.119 --> 02:03:16.840]  The government had to admit it last week.
[02:03:17.300 --> 02:03:19.282]  You know, that's something... It's an insecticide.
[02:03:20.509 --> 02:03:21.009]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:03:21.390 --> 02:03:22.450]  It's an insecticide.
[02:03:22.470 --> 02:03:27.614]  They use sodium fluoride for an insecticide to kill ants, you know, fire ants in Texas and Africa.
[02:03:27.734 --> 02:03:28.214]  Exactly!
[02:03:28.274 --> 02:03:30.976]  So I go with what I know we can do, doctor.
[02:03:31.036 --> 02:03:32.697]  I say, stop drinking fluoride!
[02:03:32.957 --> 02:03:37.079]  Or if I know we don't have the minerals we need, I'm gonna promote it, and I'm gonna do it myself.
[02:03:37.160 --> 02:03:40.181]  I mean, it's just all part of making the right decisions, isn't it?
[02:03:40.702 --> 02:03:41.202]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:03:41.222 --> 02:03:43.023]  It's kind of a do-it-yourselfer concept.
[02:03:43.764 --> 02:03:45.685]  Americans are Americans because we're independent.
[02:03:46.384 --> 02:03:51.587]  Uh... we don't want the government doing anything for us except protecting us from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:03:51.607 --> 02:03:58.051]  And in this case, the enemies domestic are the politicians and the doctors, the medical systems, and the pharmaceutical industry.
[02:03:58.231 --> 02:03:59.252]  The special interest.
[02:03:59.792 --> 02:04:08.838]  And again, that's why they're moving with Codex Alimentarius that is in, it says Codex Alimentarius, in the Food Safety Act written by Big Pharma and Big Agra.
[02:04:09.078 --> 02:04:15.002]  They want to shut down people like Dr. Joel Wallach being able to get us this information.
[02:04:15.022 --> 02:04:15.502]  And by the way,
[02:04:15.842 --> 02:04:17.063]  I'm going whole hog on this.
[02:04:17.423 --> 02:04:18.784]  I'm giving this stuff to my parents.
[02:04:19.084 --> 02:04:20.105]  I'm giving it to my family.
[02:04:20.445 --> 02:04:22.186]  I'm not even going to go out and try to sign them up.
[02:04:22.326 --> 02:04:30.071]  I'm going to give it to them first and see the results they get, because I know they're going to get great results, because I've talked to countless people over the years about Dr. Wallach.
[02:04:30.091 --> 02:04:31.892]  Dr. Wallach, oh my gosh, I was sick.
[02:04:31.952 --> 02:04:32.572]  It made me better.
[02:04:32.872 --> 02:04:34.393]  And then I did the research on the minerals.
[02:04:34.633 --> 02:04:36.615]  I remember what the vets I worked for said.
[02:04:36.935 --> 02:04:37.975]  It makes total sense.
[02:04:38.216 --> 02:04:39.356]  Let's try it out together.
[02:04:39.456 --> 02:04:41.237]  InfoWarsTeam.com.
[02:04:41.257 --> 02:04:43.479]  Dr. Joel Wallach of Dead Doctors Don't Lie.
[02:04:43.979 --> 02:04:45.820]  Syndicated by the great Michael Zwirling.
[02:04:46.020 --> 02:04:47.741]  We'll talk to you again very, very soon, sir.
[02:04:48.301 --> 02:04:49.462]  Okay, thank you so much, Alex.
[02:04:49.482 --> 02:04:49.922]  God bless you.
[02:04:49.962 --> 02:04:51.663]  And thank you so much for the Alex Tech.
[02:04:52.163 --> 02:04:52.643]  Absolutely.
[02:04:52.663 --> 02:04:55.245]  That's the number one thing up there at Infowarsteam.com.
[02:04:55.445 --> 02:04:59.367]  What Dr. Wallach thinks you absolutely need, it's right there, Infowarsteam.com.
[02:04:59.967 --> 02:05:01.127]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:05:01.147 --> 02:05:07.831]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:05:08.071 --> 02:05:10.352]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:05:10.632 --> 02:05:15.814]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:05:15.994 --> 02:05:18.775]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:05:19.035 --> 02:05:21.156]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:05:21.356 --> 02:05:27.298]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:05:27.618 --> 02:05:30.819]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:05:30.979 --> 02:05:36.481]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:05:36.761 --> 02:05:38.082]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:05:38.402 --> 02:05:39.602]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:05:39.702 --> 02:05:42.244]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:05:42.364 --> 02:05:46.425]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:05:46.606 --> 02:05:51.088]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[02:05:51.228 --> 02:05:53.669]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[02:06:59.039 --> 02:07:03.263]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:07:03.583 --> 02:07:04.183]  Number 1.
[02:07:04.504 --> 02:07:07.646]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:07:07.927 --> 02:07:08.487]  Number 2.
[02:07:08.787 --> 02:07:13.331]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:07:13.671 --> 02:07:14.132]  It's true.
[02:07:14.412 --> 02:07:18.976]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:07:19.296 --> 02:07:19.837]  Number 3.
[02:07:20.117 --> 02:07:23.400]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:07:23.700 --> 02:07:27.403]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:07:27.603 --> 02:07:28.143]  Number 4.
[02:07:28.404 --> 02:07:30.765]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:07:31.166 --> 02:07:34.528]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:07:34.848 --> 02:07:35.048]  Number 5.
[02:07:35.629 --> 02:07:39.551]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:07:39.772 --> 02:07:44.535]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:07:44.815 --> 02:07:48.857]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:48.997 --> 02:07:50.538]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:50.778 --> 02:07:52.859]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:07:53.019 --> 02:07:55.640]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:07:58.121 --> 02:08:07.465]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:08.085 --> 02:08:11.067]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:22.793 --> 02:08:30.015]  We're going to have open phones for the next 52 minutes with Bob Chapman, who's always gracious to join us every Friday in the third hour.
[02:08:30.475 --> 02:08:34.996]  His website, of course, is an invaluable place for research.
[02:08:35.036 --> 02:08:37.337]  And that, of course, is internationalforecaster.com.
[02:08:38.057 --> 02:08:44.438]  And we're going to get into the economy a little bit with him, the situation with Mexico, and a few other issues in this segment.
[02:08:44.458 --> 02:08:49.740]  And then we're going to take your phone calls, because I know Bob always enjoys hearing the different topics that
[02:08:50.900 --> 02:08:58.363]  You raise because he's a well-traveled, very intelligent guy and he can certainly field any of your questions.
[02:08:58.383 --> 02:09:00.244]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[02:09:00.264 --> 02:09:01.824]  I want to get into OPEC Minister Singh.
[02:09:07.046 --> 02:09:09.267]  Oil is going to go to $100 a barrel.
[02:09:09.707 --> 02:09:24.453]  The British are freaking out saying that will cause the EU to go down and that will push this over the edge because our economies are completely dependent, almost completely dependent, on oil and natural gas and distillates from it.
[02:09:25.414 --> 02:09:32.537]  If Lindsey Williams intel from the former head of Atlantic Richfield, who's now died so we can release his name and have,
[02:09:34.639 --> 02:09:34.719]  Yes.
[02:09:53.377 --> 02:09:55.959]  Bob, what do you think's going on here?
[02:09:55.979 --> 02:09:58.641]  You know, formerly with a U.S.
[02:09:58.661 --> 02:10:09.670]  intelligence agency, formerly the biggest private silver and gold broker, had the biggest newsletter until you retired for a decade, came back, now you have the International Forecaster.
[02:10:10.371 --> 02:10:13.013]  I'm just reintroducing Bob for some stations out there that are new.
[02:10:13.494 --> 02:10:15.235]  Bob, what is your scoop?
[02:10:16.696 --> 02:10:21.517]  Well, I think it's absolutely tragic that the shooter felt it necessary to shoot so many people.
[02:10:21.637 --> 02:10:23.958]  If he had a disagreement with his fellow
[02:10:45.555 --> 02:10:48.296]  Religious person who is, uh, misgivens.
[02:10:49.357 --> 02:10:51.898]  Um, then, uh, that's one thing.
[02:10:52.618 --> 02:11:02.783]  And of course, it's not meaningful that you should shoot anybody, but, um, they should have been left at that, but it didn't, it wasn't.
[02:11:02.923 --> 02:11:12.387]  And I, I think, uh, from my experience that spraying of bullets all over the place, uh, was a cover.
[02:11:13.488 --> 02:11:14.408]  Uh, I, I think,
[02:11:15.109 --> 02:11:17.731]  That the perpetrator knew he was going to get caught.
[02:11:18.952 --> 02:11:23.776]  And I think that the shootings of many people was a cover.
[02:11:24.637 --> 02:11:27.659]  Yes, everybody will think that Ms.
[02:11:27.679 --> 02:11:29.341]  Gibbon was the target.
[02:11:30.181 --> 02:11:31.462]  And maybe she was.
[02:11:32.463 --> 02:11:33.544]  But how about the judge?
[02:11:34.345 --> 02:11:43.392]  Who we know is probably the most conservative federal judge and continually voted pro-Second Amendment and it helped shoot down the Brady Act was Sheriff Richard Mack.
[02:11:44.758 --> 02:12:07.608]  Well, also, we're getting reports that he, just days before, had made decisions regarding the administration requesting that they be allowed to go after the assets of known
[02:12:08.425 --> 02:12:10.066]  Drug dealers of one kind or another.
[02:12:10.826 --> 02:12:15.228]  And by no judge, no jury, I did look up the ruling.
[02:12:15.528 --> 02:12:18.549]  They were saying, just let us grab anybody's money we want with no proof.
[02:12:18.829 --> 02:12:20.990]  And Judge Rolls said no, so he died.
[02:12:22.411 --> 02:12:26.072]  Well, I think, and I heard from the very beginning, he was a target.
[02:12:27.413 --> 02:12:28.893]  And they were going to teach him.
[02:12:29.614 --> 02:12:31.314]  And that's the way these people operate.
[02:12:32.255 --> 02:12:37.457]  And I understand also that they were trying to skirt going
[02:12:38.710 --> 02:13:01.161]  The administration was trying to skirt going through Congress on the issue of a trade, what I call confiscation, of furrowed cays and IRAs, of which there's $6 trillion in them, so that they could access them and trade off government-guaranteed annuities.
[02:13:02.141 --> 02:13:04.763]  And I understand he shot that down as well.
[02:13:06.263 --> 02:13:07.504]  And if that's the case,
[02:13:08.357 --> 02:13:15.042]  It gives plenty of reason to think that perhaps that was the real reason he was there.
[02:13:16.083 --> 02:13:25.570]  I understand he had debated and spoken with Misgiven before, who went to the same synagogue that he did, which makes this whole thing even worse.
[02:13:25.590 --> 02:13:27.311]  I mean, it's just like...
[02:13:28.354 --> 02:13:34.579]  If he went to the same church and you talk to somebody all the time and then you walk over and shoot him in the head.
[02:13:35.039 --> 02:13:35.359]  Yeah, I know.
[02:13:35.379 --> 02:13:37.721]  If you add all this together, he wasn't supposed to be there.
[02:13:37.741 --> 02:13:38.681]  They claim he was shopping.
[02:13:38.962 --> 02:13:56.054]  But in the indictment and the charges against the Grim Reaper killer, who admittedly now was on hallucinogens not almost every day, multiple times a day, out of his gourd, thought he was under mind control, was on drugs that caused disassociation or amnesia.
[02:13:56.334 --> 02:13:57.595]  Classic mind control.
[02:13:57.896 --> 02:14:01.579]  Sirhan Sirhan, even mainstream news admitted that that was mind control.
[02:14:01.819 --> 02:14:06.684]  The LA County Medical Examiner said that Sirhan did not shoot him.
[02:14:06.964 --> 02:14:11.068]  We know the name of the CIA agent who did shoot RFK behind the head.
[02:14:11.188 --> 02:14:12.669]  So we know this history.
[02:14:13.490 --> 02:14:19.314]  The whole thing really does stink to high heaven, and this happens right as the new Republican Congress is coming in.
[02:14:19.654 --> 02:14:23.516]  The way the media seizes on it within hours, saying it's conservatives.
[02:14:23.916 --> 02:14:30.960]  The way the police and sheriffs protected this guy, and he was death-threatening everybody for months, running around like a complete lunatic.
[02:14:31.160 --> 02:14:32.741]  They've tried to seal all of that.
[02:14:33.122 --> 02:14:36.824]  I mean, just every alarm bell, Bob Chapman goes off on this.
[02:14:37.764 --> 02:14:38.845]  Yeah, you're absolutely right.
[02:14:41.299 --> 02:14:50.195]  The, uh, Pima County, uh, Police Chief, or whatever he's called, uh, for the comments he made, on the other hand, he should be dismissed.
[02:14:52.642 --> 02:15:09.657]  Well, Bob, I don't know if you've seen all this, but I've had CNN online, I've had MSNBC, I've had Democracy Now!, a bunch of other programs basically blame myself and Ron Paul.
[02:15:09.917 --> 02:15:11.579]  They've shifted from Sarah Palin
[02:15:12.359 --> 02:15:22.604]  Uh, and Limbaugh, because it's admitted the guy's a big liberal, and now they're, or was, now they're going after their main target, the true outsiders, the true people that want a republic.
[02:15:22.984 --> 02:15:39.191]  Uh, what's your take on, uh, Rachel Maddow implying that it's un-American, what I've said and what Ron Paul has said, and she plays clips of it, that the Second Amendment isn't just there for duck hunting or to stop criminals, it's there to stop a Hitlerian or Stalinistic type regime coming to power.
[02:15:40.327 --> 02:15:44.369]  And that's exactly right, and you would expect that kind of response for her.
[02:15:45.530 --> 02:15:47.351]  I'm just disappointed they didn't name me.
[02:15:48.611 --> 02:15:49.812]  Well, Bob, I'm going to play that clip.
[02:15:49.852 --> 02:15:51.673]  I want to get your take on this.
[02:15:51.733 --> 02:15:53.474]  I'm going to read from the Declaration of Independence.
[02:15:53.994 --> 02:15:56.315]  Here is Mr. Maddow last night.
[02:16:00.857 --> 02:16:08.161]  We have a lot of domestic enemies of the Constitution, and they're right down the mall in the Congress of the United States.
[02:16:12.358 --> 02:16:17.100]  And right down Independence Avenue in the White House that belongs to us.
[02:16:17.420 --> 02:16:21.961]  It's not about my ability to hunt, which I love to do.
[02:16:22.701 --> 02:16:31.684]  It's not about the ability for me to protect my family and my property against criminals, which we have the right to do.
[02:16:32.985 --> 02:16:39.887]  But it's all about us protecting ourselves from a tyrannical government of the United States.
[02:16:41.963 --> 02:16:44.464]  Second Amendment, not about hunting or self-defense.
[02:16:44.544 --> 02:16:49.426]  It's about citizens having the ability to overthrow the tyrannical government of the United States.
[02:16:49.446 --> 02:16:52.248]  That was Congressman Paul Brown of Georgia speaking last April.
[02:16:52.628 --> 02:16:52.868]  E.J.
[02:16:52.888 --> 02:16:54.929]  Dionne wrote about this at the Washington Post today.
[02:16:55.429 --> 02:17:06.094]  He found Republican Congressman Ron Paul making roughly the same argument in print five years ago, quoting Mr. Paul, quote, the Second Amendment is not about hunting deer or keeping a pistol in your nightstand.
[02:17:06.574 --> 02:17:08.875]  It's not about protecting oneself against common criminals.
[02:17:08.935 --> 02:17:10.296]  It's about preventing tyranny.
[02:17:10.876 --> 02:17:15.382]  The founders knew that unarmed citizens would never be able to overthrow a tyrannical government as they did.
[02:17:15.983 --> 02:17:20.409]  The muskets they used against the British Army were the assault rifles of that time.
[02:17:20.770 --> 02:17:24.475]  Again, the argument here is that the Second Amendment exists so Americans can overthrow the government.
[02:17:25.556 --> 02:17:26.157]  That is a view.
[02:17:26.618 --> 02:17:28.700]  It is a radical view of gun policy.
[02:17:30.882 --> 02:17:32.243]  Americans are asked, why are you buying guns?
[02:17:32.523 --> 02:17:36.266]  They're buying it for civil unrest and to fight back against government tyranny.
[02:17:36.286 --> 02:17:39.188]  It's conservative talk radio host Alex Jones.
[02:17:39.508 --> 02:17:40.889]  Okay, it goes on from there.
[02:17:41.550 --> 02:17:43.171]  Here is the Declaration of Independence.
[02:17:43.191 --> 02:17:46.033]  This is what this country was founded on.
[02:17:46.153 --> 02:17:48.155]  This is how America started.
[02:17:48.935 --> 02:17:54.239]  And they talk about the tyranny and that the government is building a tyranny by design
[02:17:55.480 --> 02:17:57.221]  Premeditated tyranny, that's what we're fighting.
[02:17:58.361 --> 02:18:09.646]  But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing inviolably the same object, invents a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, what are we seeing?
[02:18:10.706 --> 02:18:16.969]  It is their right, it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security.
[02:18:17.369 --> 02:18:20.970]  So, Rachel Maddow hates what America is.
[02:18:21.050 --> 02:18:26.372]  She is fundamentally not an American and she is an enemy of the Republic.
[02:18:26.412 --> 02:18:29.794]  I mean, it's that simple and I will fight her in the info war.
[02:18:30.354 --> 02:18:31.875]  She will imply we're violent and evil.
[02:18:32.095 --> 02:18:34.896]  We have the most violent, illegitimate corporate
[02:18:35.416 --> 02:18:35.916]  We're good to go.
[02:19:05.316 --> 02:19:06.738]  Well, you're absolutely right about that.
[02:19:06.758 --> 02:19:07.899]  And they, from time to time, create the Hitlers.
[02:19:07.979 --> 02:19:09.261]  And Adolf Hitler was a good example.
[02:19:25.033 --> 02:19:32.662]  He was funded by the large banks and brokerage houses in New York and London.
[02:19:33.443 --> 02:19:38.489]  Although I don't think he knew where a lot of the money was coming from, do I think he cared?
[02:19:39.130 --> 02:19:40.171]  It was a wind-up toy.
[02:19:40.932 --> 02:19:41.253]  What's that?
[02:19:41.773 --> 02:19:42.153]  Stay there.
[02:19:42.213 --> 02:19:43.554]  Explain wind-up toys when we come back.
[02:19:43.614 --> 02:19:44.335]  Then phone calls.
[02:19:44.635 --> 02:19:46.437]  Then we're getting into the economy and so much more.
[02:19:46.757 --> 02:19:53.422]  But they're now sending the FBI to conservative bloggers' houses to intimidate them for writing blogs that don't talk about any violence.
[02:19:53.442 --> 02:19:56.304]  I mean, this is the commissars, the political police.
[02:20:00.209 --> 02:20:01.450]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:20:01.510 --> 02:20:06.854]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:20:07.094 --> 02:20:11.718]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:20:12.119 --> 02:20:12.519]  It's true.
[02:20:12.579 --> 02:20:15.161]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[02:20:15.401 --> 02:20:17.143]  And it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:20:17.683 --> 02:20:22.386]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:20:22.906 --> 02:20:24.827]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[02:20:25.227 --> 02:20:29.830]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:20:30.030 --> 02:20:30.930]  And here's the best part.
[02:20:31.150 --> 02:20:33.912]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:20:34.192 --> 02:20:37.494]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:20:37.814 --> 02:20:40.655]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:20:41.015 --> 02:20:42.895]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[02:20:43.236 --> 02:20:44.096]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:20:44.116 --> 02:20:44.316]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:20:44.356 --> 02:20:47.297]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:20:47.797 --> 02:20:49.537]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:20:59.835 --> 02:21:02.337]  Again, the Congressional Budget Office sounds the alarm.
[02:21:02.617 --> 02:21:04.599]  This time warns of Greek-style U.S.
[02:21:04.639 --> 02:21:05.340]  debt crises.
[02:21:05.540 --> 02:21:06.321]  You heard me right.
[02:21:06.581 --> 02:21:09.003]  The GAO is drawing a parallel between the U.S.
[02:21:09.063 --> 02:21:12.446]  economy, its debt, and the current Greek economic meltdown.
[02:21:12.726 --> 02:21:19.592]  With the debt-to-GDP chart climbing into unfamiliar territory, the growing budget deficit will rise to unsupportable levels.
[02:21:20.092 --> 02:21:21.233]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:21:21.333 --> 02:21:28.337]  The Federal Debt and Risk of Financial Crises document the CBO has published is a must-read for every American.
[02:21:28.538 --> 02:21:35.962]  Covering the risk of continued deficit spending coupled with an aging population and the rising interest rates spell economic disaster.
[02:21:36.383 --> 02:21:40.085]  It's imperative that you get a copy of this document and study it for yourself.
[02:21:40.325 --> 02:21:42.368]  Call me today at 800-686-2237 and I'll send you a free copy.
[02:21:42.388 --> 02:21:44.370]  Again, call 800-686-2237 and ask for your copy of the CBO document.
[02:21:44.390 --> 02:21:46.493]  Once again, you need to read this government report.
[02:21:46.633 --> 02:21:46.934]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:59.645 --> 02:22:01.967]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:22:02.027 --> 02:22:04.229]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:22:04.349 --> 02:22:07.531]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:22:07.571 --> 02:22:12.295]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:22:12.676 --> 02:22:16.859]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:22:17.179 --> 02:22:19.502]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:22:19.522 --> 02:22:22.066]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:22:22.406 --> 02:22:24.989]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:22:25.330 --> 02:22:32.940]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:22:33.263 --> 02:22:38.528]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:22:38.648 --> 02:22:41.450]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:22:41.490 --> 02:22:44.933]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:22:45.193 --> 02:22:46.094]  And I got news for you.
[02:22:46.254 --> 02:22:47.575]  You're everyone else.
[02:22:47.595 --> 02:22:48.596]  Invisible Empire.

[02:22:59.025 --> 02:23:05.468]  One of the most potent ways to lower blood pressure is to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme in the body, also called ACE.
[02:23:05.828 --> 02:23:10.050]  In nature, there are a group of proteins found in unheated whey that inhibit the ACE enzyme.
[02:23:10.390 --> 02:23:13.191]  The most potent ACE inhibitor to date is Lactokinin.
[02:23:13.591 --> 02:23:24.076]  While Lactokinin does not have the inhibitory potency of synthetic drugs commonly used in the treatment of hypertension, this naturally occurring whey peptide may be able to help keep blood pressure normal.
[02:23:24.536 --> 02:23:28.338]  The most powerful whey protein supplement on the market is One World Whey.
[02:23:28.698 --> 02:23:33.400]  One World Whey is the first ever unheated whey protein powder from grass-fed cows.
[02:23:34.160 --> 02:23:36.981]  One World Whey is easily digested and tastes delicious.
[02:23:37.661 --> 02:23:44.003]  Use One World Whey to support your exercise or weight loss goals, your optimal blood pressure, energy, endurance, and mood.
[02:23:44.443 --> 02:23:45.564]  To order, call 888-988-3325.
[02:23:45.624 --> 02:23:45.804]  That's 888-988-3325.
[02:23:45.844 --> 02:23:47.044]  Or visit OneWorldWhey.com.
[02:23:47.124 --> 02:23:47.825]  That's OneWorldWhey.com.
[02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:12.342]  All right, as promised, I do want to take your phone calls, but Bob was cut off by the break.
[02:24:12.362 --> 02:24:19.704]  He was getting into how the globalists, and I mean this came out in congressional hearings, finance the communists and the Nazis.
[02:24:20.204 --> 02:24:23.505]  And that's the British model, British imperial model.
[02:24:23.545 --> 02:24:31.128]  They've got to create the enemy so that they can then build up giant armaments industries that are used to then bankrupt their domestic slaves.
[02:24:31.488 --> 02:24:33.088]  That's how power is consolidated.
[02:24:33.609 --> 02:24:34.709]  Bob Chapman continuing.
[02:24:36.178 --> 02:24:45.186]  And so at Versailles, the bankers pre-wrote the treaty and they pre-wrote the conditions.
[02:24:46.388 --> 02:24:51.913]  And when Germany capitulated, they were able to do exactly what they wanted.
[02:24:52.653 --> 02:24:59.980]  And what Versailles was all about was the planning and preparation for World War II.
[02:25:00.481 --> 02:25:01.862]  That's why I mentioned the funding.
[02:25:02.638 --> 02:25:07.801]  Of Adolf Hitler, a good part of which came from non-German hands.
[02:25:08.681 --> 02:25:16.745]  And of course, the main contributors in Germany were the two major steel companies, Thyssen and Krupp.
[02:25:17.666 --> 02:25:21.227]  And they were supposed to be disbanded in 1948, and of course that never happened.
[02:25:22.228 --> 02:25:30.252]  And so, all of these enemies that were created, were created by these people and their organizations.
[02:25:31.463 --> 02:25:41.208]  And they set up this dichotomous situation in Europe after the fall of the Weimar Republic in the early 19 to mid 1920s.
[02:25:42.089 --> 02:25:56.016]  And in that effort, they split the people in Europe generally, but specifically in Germany, which had all bad problems before anybody else did, before the Great Depression came along.
[02:25:56.956 --> 02:25:59.658]  And you were either a Bolshevik,
[02:26:00.499 --> 02:26:02.360]  Or you're a National Socialist.
[02:26:03.420 --> 02:26:05.821]  And that's how they got the war going.
[02:26:06.461 --> 02:26:07.681]  And they financed both sides.
[02:26:07.761 --> 02:26:09.842]  And they do it over and over and over again.
[02:26:10.822 --> 02:26:18.564]  And that's why it's not difficult for me to figure out what they're going to do next in the world economic arena today.
[02:26:18.584 --> 02:26:19.644]  Because they've got a formula.
[02:26:20.525 --> 02:26:20.965]  That's right.
[02:26:21.065 --> 02:26:21.645]  Exactly.
[02:26:21.705 --> 02:26:22.125]  They do.
[02:26:22.145 --> 02:26:25.766]  It's disgusting.
[02:26:25.786 --> 02:26:28.227]  They have to deviate from it once in a while because
[02:26:29.642 --> 02:26:36.027]  The Alex Jones Show and other talk radio and the internet is forcing them to do that.
[02:26:37.008 --> 02:26:43.814]  And every time that we broadcast across the world we're influencing people by telling them the truth very simply.
[02:26:43.994 --> 02:26:46.316]  Well Bob, that's what's happening, that's what creeps me out.
[02:26:46.977 --> 02:26:56.524]  We've got big breaking news and I've gotten so conditioned to accept that I'm living in a tyranny and to deal with it psychologically so I can live my life that
[02:26:57.325 --> 02:26:58.886]  I'm becoming too comfortable with it.
[02:26:59.246 --> 02:27:06.892]  I mean, things are moving so quickly now, but even though I know it's evil, I'm almost just going, well, that's what's happening.
[02:27:07.232 --> 02:27:12.155]  Now they've got telescreens going up in shopping malls and Walmart telling you computers aren't safe.
[02:27:12.215 --> 02:27:14.857]  Homeland Security is taking the web over for your safety.
[02:27:14.917 --> 02:27:15.697]  Watch everyone.
[02:27:15.737 --> 02:27:16.718]  Don't trust each other.
[02:27:17.218 --> 02:27:27.005]  They're sending FBI to conservative bloggers' houses who've asked polite questions of Congress people at events, like, why did you give a political contribution to this guy if you're conservative?
[02:27:28.506 --> 02:27:36.292]  They are now issuing Homeland Security reports saying if your neighbor talks about politics, go ahead and call Homeland Security on them.
[02:27:36.653 --> 02:27:39.615]  They're saying if you buy guns and ammo, that's a sign of terrorism.
[02:27:39.955 --> 02:27:45.420]  I mean, this is all just flooding out where they're just admitting, yes, Homeland Security's for you.
[02:27:45.920 --> 02:27:53.186]  And the rollout is this guy who fits the classic MO, has every earmark of a mind control assassin.
[02:27:53.826 --> 02:27:55.067]  And then it's super creepy.
[02:27:55.808 --> 02:28:03.551]  From MSNBC, to Democracy Now, to Talk Radio, I've even got Limbaugh basically blaming me for films I'm in.
[02:28:03.571 --> 02:28:06.412]  I mean, I've got the left and right blaming me.
[02:28:06.493 --> 02:28:07.653]  It's all my fault, Bob.
[02:28:09.654 --> 02:28:15.096]  Well, it's to be expected, because you're at the spear point.
[02:28:15.116 --> 02:28:16.537]  And you are driving them crazy.
[02:28:17.237 --> 02:28:19.178]  And they want to find a way to shut you up.
[02:28:19.898 --> 02:28:21.659]  And it's not going to stop, it's going to get worse.
[02:28:22.665 --> 02:28:27.788]  So what, are they just going to keep demonizing me and then just arrest me for some trumped up baloney?
[02:28:29.169 --> 02:28:29.929]  Of course they will.
[02:28:30.609 --> 02:28:30.810]  Yeah.
[02:28:32.190 --> 02:28:34.432]  And we discussed this a dozen years ago.
[02:28:35.552 --> 02:28:36.753]  And it's not going to go away.
[02:28:37.053 --> 02:28:39.554]  And I'm a little bit older than you are.
[02:28:39.594 --> 02:28:40.975]  I'm old enough to be a dad.
[02:28:41.836 --> 02:28:47.018]  And I decided that if I'm going to continue to do what I'm doing, I'm going to get out of harm's way.
[02:28:48.099 --> 02:28:51.521]  And at least make it difficult for them to try to find me.
[02:28:52.529 --> 02:28:56.950]  And so that was my choice as an elderly person.
[02:28:57.550 --> 02:28:59.631]  But I haven't let up one bit and you know that.
[02:29:00.731 --> 02:29:05.372]  And so we got to keep on doing what we're doing because what we're doing is right and it's going to work.
[02:29:05.892 --> 02:29:09.113]  And that's why people all over the world are writing you emails.
[02:29:09.753 --> 02:29:10.674]  Thank you very much.
[02:29:11.314 --> 02:29:12.194]  Please keep it up.
[02:29:12.334 --> 02:29:13.134]  I know you're right.
[02:29:13.954 --> 02:29:15.855]  And so that's enough for us.
[02:29:17.486 --> 02:29:20.447]  Of thanks, to keep right on going doing what we're doing.
[02:29:20.687 --> 02:29:24.549]  Well, I mean, look, I've said this a thousand times, we're gonna come back and go to calls, I'll say it again.
[02:29:25.009 --> 02:29:36.194]  If this was just some boss hog corruption, I would be on the air criticizing it, because I would know it was a danger, it can grow out of control, but this is real organized evil.
[02:29:36.254 --> 02:29:39.396]  I mean, they really want the nastiest, meanest police state.
[02:29:40.376 --> 02:29:43.198]  They're openly announcing they will take everybody's pension funds.
[02:29:44.298 --> 02:29:47.041]  They're openly announcing they want to throw basically everybody in prison.
[02:29:47.381 --> 02:29:50.164]  I mean, this is really a nasty group of tyrants.
[02:29:50.184 --> 02:29:51.045]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.566 --> 02:29:53.168]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.089 --> 02:29:56.771]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.218 --> 02:30:04.842]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:30:05.222 --> 02:30:08.226]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:30:08.466 --> 02:30:13.251]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:30:13.271 --> 02:30:19.518]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:30:19.658 --> 02:30:21.900]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:30:22.441 --> 02:30:22.721]  Tim Geithner?
[02:30:22.741 --> 02:30:23.161]  Bernanke?
[02:30:23.261 --> 02:30:24.022]  They're arsonists!
[02:30:24.062 --> 02:30:25.182]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:30:25.202 --> 02:30:27.444]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:30:41.331 --> 02:30:43.172]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:30:43.472 --> 02:30:48.253]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:30:48.613 --> 02:30:57.716]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:31:01.718 --> 02:31:05.339]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:05.679 --> 02:31:13.801]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:31:14.542 --> 02:31:18.583]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:31:19.183 --> 02:31:29.986]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:31:30.626 --> 02:31:39.634]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:40.135 --> 02:31:45.199]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:31:45.580 --> 02:31:52.746]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:53.066 --> 02:31:55.468]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:31:59.725 --> 02:32:00.866]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:32:00.906 --> 02:32:07.574]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:32:07.834 --> 02:32:10.117]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:32:10.397 --> 02:32:15.603]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:32:15.783 --> 02:32:18.566]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:32:18.827 --> 02:32:20.889]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:32:21.129 --> 02:32:27.051]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:32:27.371 --> 02:32:30.571]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:32:30.751 --> 02:32:36.273]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:32:36.533 --> 02:32:37.833]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:32:38.153 --> 02:32:39.334]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:32:39.454 --> 02:32:42.014]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:32:42.134 --> 02:32:46.195]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:32:46.355 --> 02:32:48.076]  You can find the video at www.
[02:32:49.156 --> 02:32:50.859]  End of America 3.com.
[02:32:50.979 --> 02:32:53.443]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[02:33:10.148 --> 02:33:15.249]  Hello, I'm Howard Schmidt, Special Assistant to the President and Cyber Security Coordinator.
[02:33:15.569 --> 02:33:15.889]  Stop.
[02:33:16.410 --> 02:33:16.670]  Think.
[02:33:17.050 --> 02:33:17.390]  Connect.
[02:33:18.130 --> 02:33:22.831]  In today's digital age, keeping the Internet safe is a responsibility we all share.
[02:33:23.551 --> 02:33:23.851]  Stop.
[02:33:24.372 --> 02:33:24.652]  Think.
[02:33:25.012 --> 02:33:25.352]  Connect.
[02:33:25.692 --> 02:33:30.453]  We need to take time to stop and think before we connect to services over the Internet.
[02:33:30.953 --> 02:33:31.273]  Stop.
[02:33:31.793 --> 02:33:32.054]  Think.
[02:33:32.434 --> 02:33:37.715]  Connect is the national effort to encourage the public to take charge of our safety and security online.
[02:33:38.487 --> 02:33:45.691]  Remember, when we stop, think, connect, we make the internet safer for ourselves, our communities, and our nation.
[02:33:45.891 --> 02:33:50.814]  I'm going to try to be calm, but I'm going to be honest with folks.
[02:33:53.755 --> 02:33:56.557]  The police state being set up in this country and across
[02:33:58.140 --> 02:34:18.495]  Much of the rest of the world is so over-the-top, so absurd, so ridiculous that I tend to agree with Ron Paul when he said on my show a few months ago... That is the first minute or so of the 20 minutes, 19 minute, 50 second video, The Witch Hunt Begins, Citizen Spy Network.
[02:34:19.275 --> 02:34:22.157]  targets political speech gun owners.
[02:34:22.677 --> 02:34:23.857]  And it is now happening.
[02:34:23.897 --> 02:34:34.863]  They admit that Homeland Security, the Threat Fusion Centers, if you're red, white, and blue, if you're a real American who isn't a communist or an authoritarian, you are the enemy.
[02:34:35.603 --> 02:34:37.064]  And that's what Obama basically said.
[02:34:37.464 --> 02:34:44.768]  He said, you know, anybody speaking out against corruption, you're causing the violence, and we need to all, you know, together we thrive.
[02:34:44.828 --> 02:34:47.269]  That means ein Volk ein Reich, I'm sure.
[02:34:47.450 --> 02:34:47.930]  One land,
[02:34:50.211 --> 02:34:51.211]  One people, one leader.
[02:34:51.952 --> 02:34:54.712]  And they want that collectivist control.
[02:34:54.772 --> 02:35:02.795]  Instead of it's people who are bound together by the love of liberty and freedom, it's bound together by the state and control, and then making us dependent.
[02:35:03.015 --> 02:35:06.696]  I will be going into the fourth hour live today, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:35:08.456 --> 02:35:12.837]  The reason I cut a few months ago the fourth hour is because I'm starting a new TV show soon.
[02:35:13.417 --> 02:35:17.418]  I've been working on it, developing it out of house, and I'm not going to be able to do a TV show every day.
[02:35:17.438 --> 02:35:18.439]  I would do four hours of radio.
[02:35:18.459 --> 02:35:21.859]  But in the interim, I'm going to start doing four hours a lot, or part of four hours.
[02:35:22.740 --> 02:35:26.381]  And I'm going to be doing a lot of other things here.
[02:35:26.961 --> 02:35:31.622]  But continuing with Bob Chapman, a Tunisian president quits after violent protest.
[02:35:32.978 --> 02:35:43.508]  The Tunisian president fled today after 23 years in power and fled to North Africa's state as the authorities declare a state of emergency following deadly protest.
[02:35:43.868 --> 02:35:45.449]  This is what always happens in countries.
[02:35:45.469 --> 02:35:46.550]  What happened in Romania.
[02:35:46.951 --> 02:35:48.292]  What's happened in Russia before.
[02:35:48.332 --> 02:35:50.234]  What's happened here with our founding fathers.
[02:35:50.614 --> 02:35:53.437]  And they teach the firemen and police and military.
[02:35:53.477 --> 02:35:55.198]  I've got the FEMA training videos.
[02:35:55.979 --> 02:36:01.241]  They teach them that the founders are bad and that standing up against a tyrannical government is bad?
[02:36:01.621 --> 02:36:03.582]  Our founders revolted over much less.
[02:36:03.842 --> 02:36:05.363]  Now, I believe in the info war.
[02:36:05.543 --> 02:36:06.363]  I know we're winning.
[02:36:06.684 --> 02:36:09.145]  I know we can win the hearts and minds of the police and military.
[02:36:09.525 --> 02:36:14.267]  I know we can take it back through the 10th Amendment that our founders put in there as a peaceful way.
[02:36:14.867 --> 02:36:27.820]  But, if they start trying to oppress that, and trying to shut us down, and trying to take our guns, and trying to bring in a Romanian, or a Tunisian, or a Soviet-style thing, I'm not going to roll over here, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:36:27.940 --> 02:36:33.866]  And, as Kennedy said, those that make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable.
[02:36:34.835 --> 02:36:38.576]  Okay, so I'm done with churches burning.
[02:36:38.636 --> 02:36:41.217]  I'm tired of the feds blowing stuff up and blaming it on patriots.
[02:36:41.958 --> 02:36:44.099]  It's time for the military and police to choose sides.
[02:36:44.579 --> 02:36:46.219]  But here's this example of Tunisia.
[02:36:48.120 --> 02:36:49.561]  He begged them to stop.
[02:36:49.601 --> 02:36:51.641]  He begged them to grovel.
[02:36:51.661 --> 02:36:52.642]  He did a live address.
[02:36:53.002 --> 02:36:57.564]  I call on Tunisians of all political persuasions and from all regions to demonstrate patriotism and unity.
[02:36:57.884 --> 02:37:03.406]  Now, if he'd have been smart, he'd have gone and blown a little girl's head off, grabbed a mental patient and said that he did it.
[02:37:03.866 --> 02:37:08.948]  And the mental patient would have been an enemy of the Prime Minister, and then the public might have stopped.
[02:37:09.508 --> 02:37:10.648]  See, our government's smarter.
[02:37:11.168 --> 02:37:18.911]  They know how when people really start waking up and revolutions in the air, they just say, activate that schizophrenic we got drugged up, send him in, make sure they get a kid.
[02:37:19.671 --> 02:37:22.192]  Oh, by the way, next hour, why am I going into overdrive?
[02:37:22.212 --> 02:37:45.725]  Aaron has the New York Times, Aaron has the actual Nixon tapes, that when there was a political shooting that happened with George Wallace, during that whole period with Arthur Bremer, that they went and planted stuff in his house saying he was a leftist, when it turned out he was a schizophrenic.
[02:37:46.445 --> 02:37:48.806]  And there's some evidence that he probably was actually mind-controlled.
[02:37:48.826 --> 02:37:52.247]  They're just the Nixon tapes of him saying, OK, let's shut him up.
[02:37:52.667 --> 02:37:55.849]  You want to talk about that a little bit before we go to calls, Bob Chapman?
[02:37:57.569 --> 02:37:59.190]  Well, in a way, it's vague.
[02:37:59.250 --> 02:38:00.430]  It's been a long time ago.
[02:38:00.450 --> 02:38:10.934]  I had the pleasure of meeting George Wallace and Lorleen, and it was another government setup to shut him up.
[02:38:11.715 --> 02:38:13.075]  It's just as simple as that.
[02:38:13.995 --> 02:38:15.196]  And it's been so many of them.
[02:38:15.948 --> 02:38:19.069]  And that's why people have to be extremely careful.
[02:38:19.930 --> 02:38:29.774]  And you wonder why people in their 40s and 50s all of a sudden have cancer, or fast-acting cancer, and all of a sudden they're gone.
[02:38:30.014 --> 02:38:34.056]  Or they have a heart attack, and if that doesn't work, then they have an aneurysm.
[02:38:35.217 --> 02:38:40.619]  There's things that government is doing to shut up people who they don't want talking.
[02:38:42.220 --> 02:38:44.020]  And it's going to continue.
[02:38:45.808 --> 02:38:51.413]  You know, it's just like the assassin they sent after Kennedy, after Reagan.
[02:38:53.254 --> 02:38:56.757]  Unless you're going to shoot somebody behind the ear, you don't use a .22.
[02:38:56.817 --> 02:39:00.039]  You use something that's going to take them down.
[02:39:01.340 --> 02:39:12.109]  And so there's all sorts of little clues along the way that remind you that very often these people
[02:39:12.839 --> 02:39:17.901]  Are set out to do what they do by government, and that could very well be the case that we've seen in Arizona.
[02:39:17.921 --> 02:39:18.881]  We just don't know it yet.
[02:39:19.161 --> 02:39:23.243]  Well, it's confirmed that the Sirhan Sirhan was staged.
[02:39:23.263 --> 02:39:24.303]  That's even London Guardian.
[02:39:24.323 --> 02:39:25.403]  I mean, it just is confirmed.
[02:39:25.703 --> 02:39:27.424]  The police in LA even gets confirmed.
[02:39:27.464 --> 02:39:28.104]  I mean, it's fact.
[02:39:28.905 --> 02:39:38.168]  And when you look at the Arthur Bremmer situation, he was a schizophrenic, out of his mind, had clear government connections, and we got Nixon on tape, you know.
[02:39:39.787 --> 02:39:44.970]  To go over to his house and plant stuff to say that he did it for the Liberals.
[02:39:45.611 --> 02:39:51.894]  And we just saw the Democrats do that against the Conservatives, and when that didn't work, they went ahead and said, OK, it's Ron Paul and Alex Jones.
[02:39:52.195 --> 02:39:53.775]  It's those people that want to audit the Fed.
[02:39:53.816 --> 02:39:54.376]  It's their fault.
[02:39:56.597 --> 02:39:57.518]  And that will continue.
[02:39:58.538 --> 02:39:59.059]  Unabated.
[02:39:59.879 --> 02:40:02.741]  And we're going to get blamed for more and more things.
[02:40:03.561 --> 02:40:08.404]  And the way you challenge that, you meet it head on and say, look, we didn't do that.
[02:40:08.464 --> 02:40:09.285]  We wouldn't do that.
[02:40:10.027 --> 02:40:11.747]  And this is what we stand for.
[02:40:12.708 --> 02:40:19.449]  And probably 80% of the American people or more would say, gee, that's what I stand for as well.
[02:40:20.009 --> 02:40:22.269]  So the government's wrong and Alex is right.
[02:40:23.450 --> 02:40:24.990]  And they're going to dig their own hole.
[02:40:25.770 --> 02:40:30.411]  They can't win a media war, even though they control the major media.
[02:40:30.751 --> 02:40:35.272]  They can't win it because every day people are fleeing from
[02:40:35.871 --> 02:40:43.436]  The major media, whether it's television, or it's the newspapers, the magazines, they're fleeing because they know it's wrong.
[02:40:43.897 --> 02:40:46.859]  They know there's something out there, and they're looking for it.
[02:40:47.199 --> 02:40:49.080]  Maybe they won't be people who act.
[02:40:49.541 --> 02:40:50.281]  That's okay.
[02:40:50.842 --> 02:40:52.363]  Everybody isn't built that way.
[02:40:53.083 --> 02:40:54.424]  Everybody isn't a soldier.
[02:40:56.045 --> 02:41:01.429]  And so that's the direction we're headed in, and we're going to stop these people.
[02:41:02.950 --> 02:41:05.312]  All we have to do is tell the truth, and that'll do it.
[02:41:06.305 --> 02:41:13.807]  Well, I know this, at the end of my life they're not going to be able to say that I didn't engage tyranny and that I sat there on my high and den and I can't say that about you, Bob.
[02:41:14.147 --> 02:41:21.769]  I mean, this tyranny that's being brought in is so wicked, so scientific, so pervasive, so complete, it must be met with resistance.
[02:41:21.869 --> 02:41:23.689]  It is not even a question.
[02:41:24.089 --> 02:41:31.451]  I mean, we cannot give the species and uncounted generations over to this grip of what the globalists call
[02:41:32.071 --> 02:41:34.593]  The final revolution, the endless tyranny.
[02:41:35.194 --> 02:41:47.105]  I mean, they talk about how it's a complete death grip, where they will end the human species as it is known, so that we're so crippled, we can never again rise.
[02:41:47.185 --> 02:41:49.987]  I mean, that is just pure Satanism.
[02:41:50.268 --> 02:41:53.450]  Let's go ahead and take a call from Ron in New York.
[02:41:53.570 --> 02:41:54.431]  Ron, you're on the air.
[02:41:54.451 --> 02:41:54.872]  Go ahead.
[02:41:54.892 --> 02:41:56.833]  Hello, gentlemen.
[02:41:57.154 --> 02:41:57.434]  Hey, buddy.
[02:41:57.454 --> 02:41:58.195]  What's on your mind today?
[02:41:59.153 --> 02:42:04.477]  Okay, of course, the thing that's first and foremost and prominent is the shooting in Tucson, Arizona.
[02:42:05.978 --> 02:42:20.447]  One thing, I noticed a pattern that has evolved here, and I've seen this before, certainly in the last ten years I've seen this pattern, and this is why I would advise your listeners to be particularly observant and on guard.
[02:42:21.088 --> 02:42:26.251]  If you notice, you'll see one half of the media, which represents what is defined as the left
[02:42:26.900 --> 02:42:27.120]  In this
[02:42:43.965 --> 02:42:52.908]  Describe as organizations that, or media outlets, that try to pose themselves as more traditionalist or some people would call right-wing.
[02:42:52.968 --> 02:42:53.948]  Loyal opposition!
[02:42:54.228 --> 02:42:54.468]  Right.
[02:42:54.828 --> 02:43:09.012]  But the loyal opposition, if you notice, is sort of laying back, being rather melbatose and ineffective or even non-existent in its responses to the other side calling for suppression of rights.
[02:43:09.770 --> 02:43:18.020]  Now, when this happens, you have to be careful because, you see, a lot of people still believe that a lot of these institutions still function properly.
[02:43:18.540 --> 02:43:27.351]  Well, I put a certain political majority in power, or I have a certain organization that's supposed to advocate for Second Amendment rights.
[02:43:27.941 --> 02:43:38.489]  Well, when they take this approach, you better be well warned that what's happening here is that they're going to go into the back room, and this is all by design, and they're going to sell you out a little further.
[02:43:38.509 --> 02:43:40.270]  Yeah, let me stop you and get Bob's take.
[02:43:40.330 --> 02:43:42.052]  And, Ron, I haven't heard from you in years.
[02:43:42.092 --> 02:43:43.353]  Are you the retired police officer?
[02:43:43.553 --> 02:43:44.253]  Yes, I am, yes.
[02:43:44.413 --> 02:43:47.456]  Oh, you always give us... You haven't called or haven't gotten through in, what, about two years?
[02:43:47.952 --> 02:43:49.874]  Yeah, I've tried a few times with no luck.
[02:43:49.954 --> 02:43:53.778]  Yeah, but don't think I forget you, because, I mean, I recognize great patriots' voices.
[02:43:54.359 --> 02:43:54.979]  Absolutely.
[02:43:55.260 --> 02:43:59.704]  I don't watch a lot of TV, or I watch boildowns on YouTube, or clips people send me.
[02:44:00.165 --> 02:44:08.994]  But last night, I ended up watching about two hours of CNN and Fox and MSNBC to analyze what was happening after I got home.
[02:44:10.257 --> 02:44:18.958]  And I saw Fox on almost every show, except Glenn Beck, praising Obama's speech, praising that brainwashing Soviet rally.
[02:44:20.109 --> 02:44:20.409]  I don't
[02:44:41.906 --> 02:44:54.869]  And now they were fighting over who got to have the troughs and steal the money, but now the mainline Republican leadership, there are a few good new people in there, but overall, same old Newt Gingrich style, carbon taxing, gun grabbing globalists.
[02:44:55.289 --> 02:45:04.451]  They're now in there, and they're now going to share at the vampire feast on the American people with Obama, and they're going to weaken him just enough.
[02:45:05.111 --> 02:45:23.240]  I've seen Karl Rove saying he wants Obama in for another four, and they're going to power share and perch on us, and absolutely the Republicans are planning to stab us in the back like they always do, but the difference is, used to it took four, five, six, seven, eight years for a political flip-flop and people to wake up.
[02:45:23.740 --> 02:45:25.561]  They rejected Obama within six months.
[02:45:26.061 --> 02:45:32.023]  Now the Republicans are going to be rejected, it shows, in just a few months if they don't instantly start repealing stuff.
[02:45:32.244 --> 02:45:35.325]  So how are they... I mean, look, I welcome their treason now.
[02:45:35.465 --> 02:45:37.026]  Show us who you are, scum!
[02:45:37.346 --> 02:45:38.666]  Show us who you are, filth!
[02:45:38.906 --> 02:45:40.187]  Go ahead and come out in the open.
[02:45:40.227 --> 02:45:40.827]  Bob Chapman.
[02:45:41.668 --> 02:45:42.548]  And we'll drill them.
[02:45:43.868 --> 02:45:44.429]  Literally.
[02:45:45.109 --> 02:45:49.071]  And we'll keep on letting the people know what they're doing there.
[02:45:49.531 --> 02:45:50.831]  And what they were sent to do there.
[02:45:51.452 --> 02:45:52.272]  And they're not doing it.
[02:45:52.919 --> 02:45:54.200]  And who's financing them?
[02:45:55.121 --> 02:46:14.196]  All of the parties that were held by the lobbyists during the month of December for the incoming freshmen, we'll call them, and the House and the Senate, and major corporations from Wall Street and banking and insurance and pharma and transnational conglomerates.
[02:46:14.576 --> 02:46:17.038]  They were just burying them in money.
[02:46:18.079 --> 02:46:19.720]  And that, you know, we're going to see
[02:46:20.427 --> 02:46:22.088]  Who said no and who said yes?
[02:46:22.488 --> 02:46:23.048]  But it's coming.
[02:46:23.548 --> 02:46:25.248]  I think by March or April we'll know.
[02:46:25.689 --> 02:46:26.649]  Well look at Rand Paul.
[02:46:26.689 --> 02:46:28.749]  He's getting more hardcore now that he is the Senator.
[02:46:28.789 --> 02:46:32.511]  He's coming out and saying, this is all a Rahm Emanuel cooked up narrative.
[02:46:32.751 --> 02:46:34.431]  And it's freaking him out even on Fox.
[02:46:34.771 --> 02:46:36.892]  He's coming right out and they're not going to like it.
[02:46:37.592 --> 02:46:44.137]  And the fact is, he's going to live with his dad, who's going to be there counseling him, almost like Merlin counseling Arthur.
[02:46:44.157 --> 02:46:46.418]  We're going to see what happens now.
[02:46:47.199 --> 02:46:50.621]  We've got to pray for those two guys, because they're for real, and the globalists don't like them.
[02:46:50.942 --> 02:46:52.583]  Ron, great points as usual.
[02:46:52.623 --> 02:46:55.265]  Did that basically concur with where you see things going?
[02:46:56.506 --> 02:47:01.072]  It basically does, and let me give you a little bit more of information because you certainly mentioned Fox.
[02:47:01.893 --> 02:47:05.297]  We know Fox is owned by Rupert Murdoch as is the New York Post.
[02:47:05.337 --> 02:47:11.966]  Now the New York Post, and you could pull it up I'm sure online, uncharacteristically, I know I've read the paper for 15 years every day,
[02:47:12.626 --> 02:47:33.612]  Uncharacteristically now, he's taking, as I said, for lack of a better term, what we'll call a left-leaning view, and certainly I know there's not really a left or a right, there's just people out for power who are conspiring, about this issue, and they're calling for a boycott of Glock arms, and basically saying Glock is responsible for this.
[02:47:33.772 --> 02:47:37.313]  No, absolutely ridiculous, and they're always attacking the gun manufacturers.
[02:47:37.333 --> 02:47:38.774]  We've got to buy more Glock.
[02:47:39.014 --> 02:47:42.255]  Well, you notice there's record sale of Glock now, so it blew up in their face.
[02:47:42.295 --> 02:47:46.416]  Look, the good news is, this isn't 15 years ago where they could sell these hoaxes.
[02:47:46.896 --> 02:47:48.717]  Everything's blowing up in their face now.
[02:47:49.137 --> 02:48:01.021]  And that's why you see the Republicans and the Democrats kind of circling the wagons together, because they're all perched on the pile of gold, looking out from the pile at us, the American people, and they see us as wolves.
[02:48:01.941 --> 02:48:09.946]  You know, in their mind, they're the shrinking violet, you know, in their petticoat, going, oh, look at the rabble!
[02:48:10.266 --> 02:48:11.787]  SWAT teams, get them!
[02:48:11.847 --> 02:48:13.428]  Take their guns!
[02:48:13.808 --> 02:48:16.109]  I mean, they see us as dangerous, because we are!
[02:48:16.410 --> 02:48:18.231]  We're the rightful heirs of this country!
[02:48:18.471 --> 02:48:19.511]  We're the sovereigns!
[02:48:19.711 --> 02:48:20.772]  It's we, the people!
[02:48:20.832 --> 02:48:21.833]  It's our country!
[02:48:22.113 --> 02:48:26.495]  And if we don't like what this government is, we can pull it down and put something else in place!
[02:48:26.776 --> 02:48:28.657]  That's the Declaration of Independence!
[02:48:28.937 --> 02:48:29.237]  That's 1776!
[02:48:31.258 --> 02:48:32.799]  That's red, white, and blue!
[02:48:32.959 --> 02:48:33.740]  Bob Chapman!
[02:48:35.101 --> 02:48:35.722]  I hear you.
[02:48:35.742 --> 02:48:47.191]  And if we're into that, we'll remember 1788 in Paris, as it evolved into July the 14th, 1789.
[02:48:47.471 --> 02:48:53.776]  And if they want to know what's going to happen to them, if they don't stop what they're doing, just read French history.
[02:48:55.145 --> 02:48:56.947]  Let's go ahead and talk to Robert in Georgia.
[02:48:57.007 --> 02:48:58.568]  Robert, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:48:58.628 --> 02:48:59.088]  Go ahead.
[02:48:59.709 --> 02:49:02.691]  Oh, Alex and Bob, it's a true honor to be with you.
[02:49:02.711 --> 02:49:06.615]  I consider you all modern American heroes for exposing the globalists.
[02:49:06.995 --> 02:49:17.424]  And one of the points I wanted to make, I think, what convinced me that 9-11 was an inside job, that they really are that evil, was that film in Bohemian Grove.
[02:49:17.944 --> 02:49:20.807]  I think that was a divine appointment by the God of the Bible.
[02:49:21.536 --> 02:49:24.997]  That you got in there and exposed the Luciferian ritual.
[02:49:25.157 --> 02:49:28.578]  Yeah, people can't believe that I actually infiltrated and got in and got out.
[02:49:28.598 --> 02:49:30.119]  They think it must have been staged.
[02:49:30.139 --> 02:49:30.959]  They must have let him.
[02:49:31.339 --> 02:49:33.760]  For whatever reason, I snuck in.
[02:49:34.060 --> 02:49:35.480]  They didn't tell me they were letting me.
[02:49:35.901 --> 02:49:39.001]  I got questioned by the Secret Service and was able to, you know, get past them.
[02:49:39.562 --> 02:49:41.842]  And we got the footage and it's there for all to see.
[02:49:41.862 --> 02:49:45.824]  Yeah, I really believe you had angelic protection.
[02:49:45.924 --> 02:49:48.885]  Well, there's no doubt I've got that every millisecond or I'd be dead right now.
[02:49:49.165 --> 02:49:50.025]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:49:51.204 --> 02:49:53.927]  And actually my question was for Dr. Wallach.
[02:49:55.048 --> 02:50:01.095]  I've actually been using the Tangi Tangerine and I've noticed a great difference.
[02:50:01.155 --> 02:50:03.458]  I used to suffer a lot from fatigue.
[02:50:04.164 --> 02:50:08.827]  And I've been using it for several months now, plus the fact where everybody else is getting sick around me.
[02:50:09.368 --> 02:50:13.310]  I seem to be avoiding the sicknesses, the colds that other people are experiencing.
[02:50:34.885 --> 02:50:48.097]  Well, uh, I noticed in the plant-derived mineral powder and the ingredients, one of the ingredients was mercury and I saw lead, but I know it's just like with vitamin C. If you take too much of that, you get toxic.
[02:50:48.177 --> 02:50:54.744]  Yeah, I think they have to put that because something naturally derived is going to have just trace amounts of it bound into it.
[02:50:55.284 --> 02:50:56.986]  Like any fish has some mercury.
[02:50:57.746 --> 02:50:58.827]  I think that's the answer there.
[02:51:00.345 --> 02:51:03.626]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[02:51:04.447 --> 02:51:08.669]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[02:51:08.949 --> 02:51:14.871]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[02:51:15.111 --> 02:51:17.232]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[02:51:17.532 --> 02:51:23.475]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[02:51:23.615 --> 02:51:26.957]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[02:51:27.037 --> 02:51:28.739]  There is no other program of its kind.
[02:51:28.899 --> 02:51:30.940]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.

[02:54:02.308 --> 02:54:06.389]  Okay, Ron, Tim, Adam, Tim and others, we'll get to your calls in this segment.
[02:54:06.409 --> 02:54:07.349]  The next is Bob Chapman.
[02:54:07.609 --> 02:54:09.810]  Then I'm going to come back live with Aaron Dykes.
[02:54:10.810 --> 02:54:11.790]  It was declassified.
[02:54:11.810 --> 02:54:12.430]  It was released.
[02:54:12.510 --> 02:54:24.473]  Richard Nixon planning to blame the shooting of George Wallace on the Democrats, knowing that the guy was a paranoid schizophrenic and probably, the evidence shows, under their control as an operative.
[02:54:25.273 --> 02:54:26.674]  But we know that was a staged event.
[02:54:26.694 --> 02:54:27.194]  They planted
[02:54:28.214 --> 02:54:38.517]  Black Panther stuff and then porno magazines to make him look crazy or sexually deviant on top of it and then all this Democratic Party stuff to make it look like
[02:54:39.403 --> 02:54:40.184]  He was a supporter.
[02:54:40.504 --> 02:54:47.770]  And on these tapes, you hear Nixon calling the Kennedys and saying, if you need any more Secret Service protection, I want to protect you.
[02:54:47.790 --> 02:54:51.433]  Looks like the liberals are behind this, and they might want to get you too.
[02:54:52.074 --> 02:54:54.556]  And, oh, let me call Mrs. Wallace.
[02:54:54.596 --> 02:54:56.397]  I'm so sorry about the governor.
[02:54:56.437 --> 02:54:57.638]  I'm so sorry about him.
[02:54:58.891 --> 02:54:59.871]  And then he hangs up the phone.
[02:55:00.251 --> 02:55:01.351]  Get ready to set him up.
[02:55:01.431 --> 02:55:02.792]  I hate that right-wing kook.
[02:55:03.352 --> 02:55:06.732]  Let's get in his apartment and blame the leftists immediately.
[02:55:07.112 --> 02:55:09.373]  There's just hours of it, listening to Nixon.
[02:55:10.513 --> 02:55:14.714]  But, oh, today Rahm Emanuel and Obama aren't doing that.
[02:55:14.774 --> 02:55:15.394]  We know they are.
[02:55:15.594 --> 02:55:23.535]  Before we go back to Bob Chapman, I want to tell you about End of America, number three dot com, dealing with dollar, default dollar, losing its World Reserve currency status.
[02:55:23.875 --> 02:55:26.716]  Stansbury and Associates Investment Research is an independent investment firm.
[02:55:27.436 --> 02:55:38.027]  Founded 99 with subscribers in more than 100 different countries, they recently created an eye-opening video that's free, that can be seen at EndOfAmericaTheNumberThree.com for free, detailing their biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:55:38.587 --> 02:55:41.330]  Again, check out their website at EndOfAmericaTheNumberThree.com
[02:55:43.832 --> 02:55:49.315]  Uh, and also don't forget we're offering five months free right now at PrisonPlanet.tv, but that will end at the end of the month.
[02:55:49.335 --> 02:55:59.060]  You get the live video streams of the show as well, not just the audio, and all my films, expanded extras, and your support of PrisonPlanet.tv makes this transmission possible.
[02:55:59.520 --> 02:56:01.801]  Uh, let's talk to Braun in Alabama.
[02:56:02.122 --> 02:56:04.243]  You're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[02:56:04.263 --> 02:56:04.583]  Go ahead.
[02:56:05.782 --> 02:56:06.782]  Hey, good afternoon, Alex.
[02:56:07.122 --> 02:56:07.463]  Hello.
[02:56:08.043 --> 02:56:09.023]  Welcome.
[02:56:09.363 --> 02:56:11.024]  If you will, I have two quick points.
[02:56:11.124 --> 02:56:15.725]  I don't know if you have time for it, but the first one, I wanted to suggest a Google bomb.
[02:56:17.526 --> 02:56:25.689]  A lot of mainstream artists, sometimes they come and go when they talk about being anti-globalist.
[02:56:26.069 --> 02:56:28.389]  But there was a new one I just saw on a music video the other day.
[02:56:28.790 --> 02:56:30.690]  There's a rapper, B.O.B.
[02:56:30.710 --> 02:56:32.271]  I don't know if you've heard of him.
[02:56:33.700 --> 02:56:40.645]  It's B period O period B, but you released a song called The Watchers and the video goes right along with it.
[02:56:41.305 --> 02:56:49.570]  It shows you a lot of things that, I mean, your listeners are probably already up on, but I thought maybe... Well, we are doing a Google bomb today that I only plugged once.
[02:56:49.611 --> 02:56:50.771]  We need to make it number one.
[02:56:50.851 --> 02:56:58.096]  It's Witch Hunt FBI, and that will lead people to our article, Witch Hunt FBI Visiting Conservative Bloggers After Tucson Shootings.
[02:56:58.156 --> 02:57:00.558]  This is something we've really got to get the word out on.
[02:57:01.098 --> 02:57:05.344]  And not just the media telling you how great it is the FBI is now our political police.
[02:57:05.765 --> 02:57:07.567]  Our article with Watson counters that.
[02:57:07.708 --> 02:57:14.117]  Everybody please Google bomb today the search witch hunt FBI to show what's happening.
[02:57:14.357 --> 02:57:16.660]  But I will check into that wrapper.
[02:57:16.701 --> 02:57:17.462]  What was the other point?
[02:57:18.727 --> 02:57:27.353]  Okay, the other point is that most of the time you speak about rising consciousness and how everyone everywhere is starting to wake up to certain things.
[02:57:27.534 --> 02:57:29.195]  Well, not everyone because obviously we'd be winning.
[02:57:29.715 --> 02:57:32.117]  It's not even consciousness, it's just being aware.
[02:57:32.657 --> 02:57:34.779]  Go ahead.
[02:57:34.839 --> 02:57:38.602]  Waking up and looking around to your surroundings.
[02:57:39.542 --> 02:57:40.403]  I called in over
[02:57:41.883 --> 02:57:46.144]  Over the break, I believe it was right before New Year's, but I was listening to another podcast.
[02:57:46.224 --> 02:57:50.445]  I won't plug them or anything like that, but it's a very reliable source.
[02:57:50.485 --> 02:57:59.788]  They had a couple of guests on talking about the eclipse on the Solstice and how... Yeah, I don't... Listen, I gotta go because we're almost out of time.
[02:58:00.148 --> 02:58:01.608]  I don't get into all the esoteric stuff.
[02:58:01.848 --> 02:58:04.649]  When I say raise your consciousness, I mean actual brainwaves.
[02:58:04.689 --> 02:58:05.649]  I mean be aware.
[02:58:05.909 --> 02:58:08.250]  Don't just be a blob watching television.
[02:58:08.290 --> 02:58:09.470]  Bob Chapman comments on that.
[02:58:10.620 --> 02:58:11.701]  No, I think you covered it.
[02:58:12.362 --> 02:58:13.403]  Let's get on to the next one.
[02:58:13.823 --> 02:58:14.784]  We're going to break though.
[02:58:14.884 --> 02:58:15.765]  Suspend 30 seconds.
[02:58:16.185 --> 02:58:18.427]  On your view of the awakening, is it accelerating?
[02:58:21.490 --> 02:58:22.291]  Oh, it certainly is.
[02:58:24.393 --> 02:58:28.036]  So will the same old tricks the establishment has used in the past work now?
[02:58:29.117 --> 02:58:29.838]  I don't think so.
[02:58:30.338 --> 02:58:32.140]  I think they're going to have to invent something new.
[02:58:33.141 --> 02:58:35.043]  And I think they're going to have to
[02:58:36.623 --> 02:58:39.925]  Um, do a lot of things that they used to do in the open undercover.
[02:59:06.323 --> 02:59:06.743]  We're good to go.
[02:59:24.778 --> 02:59:29.782]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis and you can't eat paper, stocks or metals.
[02:59:30.082 --> 02:59:35.265]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[02:59:35.445 --> 02:59:38.408]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[02:59:38.648 --> 02:59:41.590]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[02:59:41.650 --> 02:59:42.410]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[02:59:50.819 --> 02:59:53.706]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:54.427 --> 02:59:57.634]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:06.258 --> 03:00:12.926]  Coming up, we're going to look at the shooting of George Wallace, which on record, Nixon had people plant things in the shooter's house.
[03:00:13.466 --> 03:00:18.552]  The schizophrenic, to make it look political, evidence is the shooter was clearly under mind control.
[03:00:18.932 --> 03:00:21.655]  We know Sirhan Sirhan was, but finishing up with Bob Chapman.
[03:00:22.785 --> 03:00:24.105]  of the international forecaster.com.
[03:00:24.125 --> 03:00:29.087]  By the way, you can call Midas Resources, get a free hard copy or a free digital copy of the latest issue.
[03:00:29.147 --> 03:00:29.867]  It's invaluable.
[03:00:30.287 --> 03:00:31.267]  Intel 800-686-2237, 800-686-2237.
[03:00:31.367 --> 03:00:40.129]  If you want a free hard copy or one digitally emailed to you, it comes out several times a week.
[03:00:40.489 --> 03:00:43.730]  Okay, let's jam in a few more calls.
[03:00:44.450 --> 03:00:46.071]  But before we do that, you were finishing up, Bob.
[03:00:46.091 --> 03:00:46.491]  You're saying...
[03:00:48.254 --> 03:00:54.728]  They're using 20, 30-year-old brainwashing and propaganda systems in the modern era and it's not working.
[03:00:56.554 --> 03:00:56.954]  You're right.
[03:00:57.194 --> 03:01:01.096]  Too many people are aware of the methods that they've used in the past.
[03:01:01.837 --> 03:01:15.283]  And I think a lot of things that they've been doing in the open in the last several years, I think they're going to have to think twice about it and start to be more surreptitious about what they do, keeping it under cover.
[03:01:18.084 --> 03:01:26.573]  Like if somebody dies and they're one of them, they're not going to be able to make a big thing about it in the future as they have in the past.
[03:01:27.333 --> 03:01:31.297]  They're going to have to be cooler about what they do.
[03:01:31.658 --> 03:01:40.707]  And I think you'll start to see that happen because they see that what we're accomplishing and they don't like it very much.
[03:01:43.331 --> 03:01:46.055]  Okay, let's go ahead and take another phone call here.
[03:01:46.115 --> 03:01:47.437]  Let's talk to Tim in Michigan.
[03:01:47.597 --> 03:01:48.839]  Tim, you're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[03:01:49.960 --> 03:01:50.922]  Hey, Alex.
[03:01:51.462 --> 03:01:51.783]  Hey, buddy.
[03:01:52.611 --> 03:01:53.431]  How you doing, man?
[03:01:53.491 --> 03:01:56.712]  I think I'm going to change my handle with search term Tim.
[03:01:57.693 --> 03:01:59.213]  And by the way, I'd like to thank you.
[03:02:01.114 --> 03:02:12.978]  I've heard many times, I listen to you every day, that you mentioned a guy, Tim from Michigan, originally inspired you to start the search term bomb.
[03:02:13.278 --> 03:02:16.799]  It made me feel good that I made that much of an impact.
[03:02:16.899 --> 03:02:18.080]  Sure, that's how it does work.
[03:02:19.780 --> 03:02:23.605]  I'd like to thank you personally for that.
[03:02:23.765 --> 03:02:28.911]  I got a bunch of stuff, man, but I don't even know where to start.
[03:02:28.971 --> 03:02:37.081]  So I'm going to start first by saying that Obama's speech propaganda thing, I watched his speech this morning and you know what I thought?
[03:02:38.368 --> 03:02:39.328]  You know, I live in Detroit.
[03:02:39.348 --> 03:02:44.049]  Do you know how many people get shot and killed in Detroit by the week?
[03:02:44.129 --> 03:02:44.489]  No, no.
[03:02:44.509 --> 03:02:52.110]  Now Michelle has put out a letter to parents trying to make people think about their kids getting killed and then to associate it with loving her.
[03:02:52.130 --> 03:03:01.472]  I mean, they're just these drama queens, always moralizing, putting themselves in everyone's way, and about, see, you didn't love us, you made the little girl die.
[03:03:01.492 --> 03:03:03.112]  Oh, worship me.
[03:03:03.372 --> 03:03:04.513]  And all her fake crying.
[03:03:04.573 --> 03:03:05.553]  It's disgusting, Tim.
[03:03:05.573 --> 03:03:06.233]  We're out of time.
[03:03:07.113 --> 03:03:16.275]  I'd love to talk to you more, and I'm going to try to get to Adam, Tim, Mark, Roy, and others after Bob's gone, but we got Aaron coming in here with something the media is not talking about, and something they don't want you to look at.
[03:03:16.635 --> 03:03:24.377]  But, I mean, it's just so disgusting to see them when you're awake, Bob, how transparent that the psychic vampires are.
[03:03:24.417 --> 03:03:25.397]  They make me want to throw up.
[03:03:26.117 --> 03:03:33.759]  Well, you're absolutely right, but the problem is the average person certainly doesn't see it, unless they watch it.
[03:03:34.850 --> 03:03:37.192]  Continually, or more often than others.
[03:03:38.432 --> 03:03:41.534]  And they're just not equipped to know what these people are up to.
[03:03:42.455 --> 03:03:50.280]  And even in the other half of the population, those who can think more clearly, they have a hard time as well.
[03:03:50.920 --> 03:03:54.282]  We're talking about things that people don't normally run into.
[03:03:54.302 --> 03:04:01.287]  I mean, it's just like people who we would expect would know about municipal bonds, and they don't know what they are.
[03:04:02.228 --> 03:04:06.195]  And so that's why we have to teach here on radio and television.
[03:04:06.716 --> 03:04:11.504]  So the people will understand very simply what's being done to them.
[03:04:15.250 --> 03:04:33.774]  Well, you're right about that, Bob, and it's certainly rough times ahead, but we don't have any choice but to stand up against this because the globalists have shown in every other nation, and here domestically, they want to destroy things so that there's no path left for the general public to ever bring them to justice.
[03:04:34.434 --> 03:04:37.535]  They use poverty and police state as a tool.
[03:04:37.935 --> 03:04:39.315]  I mean, it is literal darkness
[03:04:39.975 --> 03:04:40.535]  You got it.
[03:04:40.555 --> 03:04:41.916]  Thank you all for listening.
[03:05:00.424 --> 03:05:06.869]  One of the most potent ways to lower blood pressure is to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme in the body, also called ACE.
[03:05:07.229 --> 03:05:11.472]  In nature, there are a group of proteins found in unheated whey that inhibit the ACE enzyme.
[03:05:11.812 --> 03:05:14.614]  The most potent ACE inhibitor to date is Lactokinin.
[03:05:15.014 --> 03:05:25.442]  While Lactokinin does not have the inhibitory potency of synthetic drugs commonly used in the treatment of hypertension, this naturally occurring whey peptide may be able to help keep blood pressure normal.
[03:05:25.942 --> 03:05:29.803]  The most powerful whey protein supplement on the market is One World Whey.
[03:05:30.103 --> 03:05:34.804]  One World Whey is the first ever unheated whey protein powder from grass-fed cows.
[03:05:35.564 --> 03:05:38.385]  One World Whey is easily digested and tastes delicious.
[03:05:39.065 --> 03:05:45.406]  Use One World Whey to support your exercise or weight loss goals, your optimal blood pressure, energy, endurance, and mood.
[03:05:45.846 --> 03:05:46.987]  To order, call 888-988-3325.
[03:05:47.027 --> 03:05:47.207]  That's 888-988-3325.
[03:05:47.227 --> 03:05:47.467]  Or visit
[03:05:54.028 --> 03:05:55.389]  OneWorldWay.com.
[03:05:55.609 --> 03:05:58.911]  That's OneWorldW-H-E-Y.com.
[03:06:00.752 --> 03:06:04.394]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:06:04.774 --> 03:06:07.775]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:06:08.016 --> 03:06:12.818]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:06:12.838 --> 03:06:19.041]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:06:19.202 --> 03:06:21.443]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[03:06:21.903 --> 03:06:22.163]  Tim Geithner?
[03:06:22.183 --> 03:06:22.343]  Bernanke?
[03:06:22.363 --> 03:06:22.723]  They're arsonists!
[03:06:22.783 --> 03:06:23.444]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:06:23.464 --> 03:06:25.184]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:06:40.891 --> 03:06:42.712]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:06:42.732 --> 03:06:47.776]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[03:06:48.157 --> 03:06:57.284]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:06:58.965 --> 03:07:02.148]  There's a man named Dr. Wallach who is anything but your typical doctor.
[03:07:02.488 --> 03:07:12.897]  Both a veterinarian and naturopathic physician, Doc asks, why does the United States spend more money on health care by far and still rank 50th in health and longevity worldwide?
[03:07:13.257 --> 03:07:22.405]  He believes that people should empower themselves with a basic understanding of nutrition, taking charge of their life, and attain optimal health and longevity through nutrition,
[03:07:22.825 --> 03:07:25.787]  Not by toxic prescription drugs, leading to side effects.
[03:07:26.088 --> 03:07:27.709]  This is clearly a deadly recipe.
[03:07:28.049 --> 03:07:37.316]  The good news is, Doc Wallach's message is resonating with an increasing number of Americans who are waking up to all the big government and big pharma manipulation of our healthcare system.
[03:07:37.636 --> 03:07:44.902]  I like what Doc Wallach is saying and doing to enlighten people about healthcare, and have joined forces to help this tireless crusader spread his message.
[03:07:45.362 --> 03:07:49.946]  Visit Infowarsteam.com and listen to Dr. Wallach's Deadly Recipes lecture.
[03:07:50.246 --> 03:07:53.969]  It makes a lot of sense, and I want you to join our Infowars team.
[03:07:54.190 --> 03:07:56.171]  Go to Infowarsteam.com.
[03:07:56.392 --> 03:07:58.754]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[03:08:00.455 --> 03:08:06.000]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:20.221 --> 03:08:24.524]  Well, in studio with us is Aaron Dykes for this segment.
[03:08:24.584 --> 03:08:27.465]  And Kurt Nemo worked on this story last night and this morning.
[03:08:27.566 --> 03:08:29.307]  It was Aaron yesterday that pointed it out to me.
[03:08:29.967 --> 03:08:32.008]  I had read about it in history but kind of forgotten about it.
[03:08:32.608 --> 03:08:38.312]  Is government attempting Nixon-esque dirty trick with Loeffner, the deranged shooter?
[03:08:39.693 --> 03:08:41.354]  Because if you go back to Nixon,
[03:08:42.194 --> 03:08:49.281]  And the campaign that was going on with George McGovern and the outsider, George Wallace, who was like a Ron Paul.
[03:08:49.301 --> 03:09:04.955]  I mean, they called him racist and stuff, but the point is he was an outsider, he was winning, they were scared of him, and Nixon's on tape admitting, get over to his house, get over to the shooter's house, plant Democratic stuff in there to blame this on McGovern, who
[03:09:05.956 --> 03:09:11.601]  Who was the person running behind for the Democratic nomination, George Wallace, who was in the lead.
[03:09:12.141 --> 03:09:15.624]  And there's a lot of evidence and research that this was another CIA mind control op.
[03:09:16.224 --> 03:09:25.031]  You know, the medical people said that, oh, it looks like Arthur Bremmer, the assassin, would-be assassin, that pumped four rounds into the stomach of George Wallace, was a schizophrenic.
[03:09:25.272 --> 03:09:28.094]  But that's what mind control does, it artificially creates that.
[03:09:28.534 --> 03:09:30.336]  But here's Nixon, and the audio's coming up.
[03:09:31.016 --> 03:09:34.637]  It's scratchy, but again, we even have the New York Times confirming this.
[03:09:35.118 --> 03:09:38.239]  People hear the Nixon tapes about other crimes and can't believe it.
[03:09:38.639 --> 03:09:43.581]  But Aaron, break down the history, break down the facts of this and the parallel of what's happening today.
[03:09:44.681 --> 03:09:56.766]  Yeah, so Wallace was, George Wallace was an important candidate because in 68, he was the first outsider or third party, at least in any main contemporary history, to actually get electoral votes.
[03:09:57.446 --> 03:09:57.866]  I think so.
[03:10:15.091 --> 03:10:25.157]  But the important thing is that it's admitted, and it's on tape as you're about to hear, that Nixon schemed to tie his foes, that is, the Democrats, to the Wallace attack.
[03:10:25.197 --> 03:10:32.842]  It's a direct parallel to the way the Democrats have been just shamelessly and disgustingly playing for political points this stuff with Loeffner.
[03:10:33.642 --> 03:10:34.964]  Yeah, don't let a good crisis go to waste!
[03:10:48.579 --> 03:10:50.160]  Right, out of the Rahm Emanuel playbook.
[03:10:50.240 --> 03:10:51.441]  But who else had the playbook?
[03:10:51.681 --> 03:10:54.002]  You know, it was Nixon back in the 60s.
[03:10:54.042 --> 03:11:05.428]  And this was this classical 1972-era dirty tricks campaign with the likes of Howard Hunt, Colson in the White House, and the other players you may have read about if you've read that part of history.
[03:11:06.528 --> 03:11:07.489]  Well, well said, Aaron.
[03:11:07.729 --> 03:11:13.412]  Let's continue going over, for those that don't remember this era in history, exactly what was going on at the time.
[03:11:14.775 --> 03:11:21.020]  Well, it was in May of the 1972 race before the primary candidates had been fully selected.
[03:11:21.040 --> 03:11:23.162]  It was a wide field in the Democrats.
[03:11:23.182 --> 03:11:27.845]  Of course, this was the term after Bobby Kennedy was shot and so forth.
[03:11:27.865 --> 03:11:30.928]  And you have Arthur Bremmer coming out of nowhere, another loner.
[03:11:31.588 --> 03:11:31.948]  I don't
[03:11:52.580 --> 03:11:54.521]  Other White House aides bring up the record.
[03:11:54.561 --> 03:11:56.642]  They say, well, this guy has a previous arrest.
[03:11:56.702 --> 03:11:58.543]  Maybe they'll have something to do with the gun shooting.
[03:11:58.983 --> 03:12:00.123]  Nixon says, screw it.
[03:12:00.563 --> 03:12:01.744]  Just go with the left thing.
[03:12:01.784 --> 03:12:02.584]  Just publish it.
[03:12:03.004 --> 03:12:04.025]  Get Coulson to call us.
[03:12:04.085 --> 03:12:04.785]  It doesn't matter.
[03:12:04.825 --> 03:12:06.426]  Say we've got conclusive proof.
[03:12:07.026 --> 03:12:21.403]  That's right, yeah, and Coulson called his, quote, friends in the media, including Bob Woodward, um, and they reported that it was a leftist thing and that- And again, Bob Woodward, high-level naval intelligence, and then, of course, later they used him to then burn Nixon from internally.
[03:12:21.743 --> 03:12:23.765]  I mean, this is just a pack of weasels.
[03:12:24.326 --> 03:12:31.450]  Yeah, so you're going to hear those smoking guns in this condensed two-minute clip, but you should also listen to the 17-minute clip linked in Kurt's article.
[03:12:31.951 --> 03:12:40.896]  He compares it to the JFK assassination, says how they screwed that one up, and instead of linking the, quote, communist Oswald to the leftists, they blamed it on the
[03:12:40.896 --> 03:12:45.858]  Of course, he was in Dallas the night before I've interviewed the mistress with LBJ that was there, all confirmed.
[03:12:45.918 --> 03:12:51.841]  Now the head commander of the Operation Famous Black Ops, assassination commander E. Howard Hunt admits it all.
[03:12:52.041 --> 03:12:53.061]  We've got it from every angle.
[03:12:53.081 --> 03:12:56.102]  We've got LBJ's lawyer confirming the exact same story.
[03:12:56.423 --> 03:12:57.183]  And then here's Nixon.
[03:12:57.463 --> 03:12:58.844]  Yeah, we already screwed that up.
[03:12:58.884 --> 03:13:01.685]  I mean, these people are just so sick.
[03:13:02.125 --> 03:13:05.366]  Yeah, and he even compares the Wallace shooting to Huey Long.
[03:13:05.386 --> 03:13:07.387]  Says, eh, that guy should remember Huey Long.
[03:13:07.407 --> 03:13:08.147]  He's just like him.
[03:13:08.367 --> 03:13:09.748]  One of those guys who stirs up hate.
[03:13:09.828 --> 03:13:12.989]  It's a real parallel to the kind of rhetoric we're seeing.
[03:13:13.009 --> 03:13:16.090]  And remember, they haven't released but a thimble of these.
[03:13:16.370 --> 03:13:17.871]  They use the rest of it for blackmail.
[03:13:18.471 --> 03:13:22.795]  And that's why, I mean, we know they're blackmailing Obama.
[03:13:23.075 --> 03:13:27.158]  We've got really good intel that I can't get into at this time that Glenn Beck is blackmailed.
[03:13:27.218 --> 03:13:28.239]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[03:13:28.700 --> 03:13:32.603]  I mean, this is the stock and trade of this New World Order.
[03:13:32.663 --> 03:13:33.904]  This is how they control people.
[03:13:34.264 --> 03:13:38.105]  And they've been obviously blackmailing Limbaugh all these years with his drugs and other things he's doing.
[03:13:38.605 --> 03:13:43.027]  And that's why all of us that are fighting tyranny have got to try to be as upright and good as we can.
[03:13:43.447 --> 03:13:48.028]  Like somebody out of the movie, which is a true story, like El Cid or something, Tarleton Heston.
[03:13:48.268 --> 03:13:50.169]  I mean, we've got to be strong and pure.
[03:13:50.189 --> 03:13:52.350]  And that's the only thing that's fulfilling.
[03:13:52.790 --> 03:13:56.431]  And they will use anything, any dirt against you, and they'll even manufacture dirt.
[03:13:57.131 --> 03:14:13.185]  Oh, exactly, because in this Wallace shooting, what you hear on tape and then what happened, according to all the accounts we have with Coulson and Hunt, Hunt wrote about it in his autobiography, Nixon ordered them to break into Bremmer's house and plant the literature that would blame it on McGovern, Kennedy, or anyone else on the left.
[03:14:13.385 --> 03:14:16.588]  And magically, when the FBI later got there, it was all there.
[03:14:16.648 --> 03:14:18.269]  All the stuff they wanted put in there was there.
[03:14:18.289 --> 03:14:19.390]  Yeah, the secret service.
[03:14:19.430 --> 03:14:27.296]  And then they magically found a diary hidden under a bridge years later that proved it all.
[03:14:27.316 --> 03:14:28.998]  But they also found the one the day after.
[03:14:29.018 --> 03:14:30.699]  I had to check my facts on that yesterday.
[03:14:31.119 --> 03:14:35.243]  But a lot of people, including Gore Vidal, believed Howard Hunt himself planted that because
[03:14:35.743 --> 03:14:42.186]  The first line of this journal said, it is my plan to kill either Nixon or Wallace with the pistol I have.
[03:14:42.246 --> 03:14:44.948]  I'm paraphrasing, but it's all right there in the report.
[03:14:44.988 --> 03:14:47.429]  Yeah, and Kurt did an article that links to all this.
[03:14:47.569 --> 03:14:51.291]  Is government attempting Nixon-esque dirty trick with Loeffner?
[03:14:52.171 --> 03:14:59.815]  Let's go ahead and play this two-minute condensed audio clip of the 17-minute unedited Nixon tape that's up on Infowars.com.
[03:14:59.855 --> 03:15:00.195]  Here it is.
[03:15:06.493 --> 03:15:09.435]  We've got to be a government.
[03:15:09.535 --> 03:15:11.597]  We've got to be a person.
[03:15:11.677 --> 03:15:13.038]  You know what I mean?
[03:15:13.058 --> 03:15:17.621]  All, everything's got to be... Rumors are going to flow all over the place.
[03:15:17.681 --> 03:15:19.663]  Put them on the left right away.
[03:15:19.723 --> 03:15:20.223]  Can you do that?
[03:15:20.263 --> 03:15:21.764]  Who can you put it to?
[03:15:21.904 --> 03:15:23.686]  I'll have them get out.
[03:15:23.786 --> 03:15:24.486]  That's terrible.
[03:15:24.526 --> 03:15:25.687]  That's terrible.
[03:15:25.727 --> 03:15:25.807]  Okay.
[03:15:25.827 --> 03:15:26.528]  Must get out fast.
[03:15:26.608 --> 03:15:29.350]  Before they pin this on the right wing.
[03:15:29.410 --> 03:15:31.591]  Be sure to pin the assassination.
[03:15:31.651 --> 03:15:33.773]  Just as they tried to pin the assassination.
[03:15:34.577 --> 03:15:37.158]  We've played the game of who's smarter, Jim.
[03:15:37.218 --> 03:15:41.160]  They have pinned the assassination of Kennedy on the right wing of the virtues.
[03:15:41.260 --> 03:15:43.241]  It was done by a communist.
[03:15:43.721 --> 03:15:47.903]  And it was the greatest hope that has ever been perpetuated.
[03:15:49.013 --> 03:15:52.414]  Can I respectfully suggest, can we pin this on one of theirs?
[03:15:52.434 --> 03:15:54.635]  Well, we can let you reap on it.
[03:15:54.895 --> 03:15:55.075]  Sure.
[03:15:55.115 --> 03:16:01.417]  See, no, no service at all moves the story in a hurry, but this one was a student radical revolutionary.
[03:16:01.457 --> 03:16:02.197]  That's easy.
[03:16:02.257 --> 03:16:03.337]  She's still a student.
[03:16:03.357 --> 03:16:04.458]  I'm worried about her.
[03:16:04.478 --> 03:16:06.358]  Twenty-one years old.
[03:16:06.418 --> 03:16:06.538]  Yeah.
[03:16:06.618 --> 03:16:07.899]  I'm worried it'll move that way.
[03:16:07.919 --> 03:16:10.479]  I'm going to say he was a supporter.
[03:16:10.519 --> 03:16:14.220]  Just say he was a supporter of McGovern and Kennedy.
[03:16:14.260 --> 03:16:15.021]  Just put that out.
[03:16:15.081 --> 03:16:16.641]  Just say you have it on unmistakable evidence.
[03:16:17.321 --> 03:16:22.206]  They've got a previous arrest on this guy, so there ought to be a record on it.
[03:16:22.226 --> 03:16:28.332]  The word, screw the record, just say he was the plumber of that and that, and put it on.
[03:16:28.392 --> 03:16:38.262]  We have an authenticated reporter, and Chuck, the thing is, tell your man, Ross, this is a hot tip, and give it to somebody who's a friend.
[03:16:39.123 --> 03:16:45.570]  One of the concerns is to let the press or the local police or somebody else get it for you.
[03:16:45.630 --> 03:16:48.634]  We don't have any control over it.
[03:16:48.674 --> 03:16:49.555]  Some of us do.
[03:16:49.595 --> 03:16:50.536]  Some of us don't.
[03:16:50.616 --> 03:16:51.116]  Of course!
[03:16:51.196 --> 03:16:53.939]  Of course he's a student of radical fascism.
[03:16:54.040 --> 03:16:59.666]  And I said, of course he's from Wisconsin and he worked in McGovern's Norfolk on Smoocher Nugget.
[03:17:01.395 --> 03:17:05.518]  Again, we have a transcript of that, but go over basically what Nixon was saying there again, Aaron.
[03:17:05.839 --> 03:17:09.241]  Yeah, of course the audio is tough, but that is the historical document we have.
[03:17:09.722 --> 03:17:13.725]  And he says screw the record, just blame it on the left, put it on McGovern or Kennedy.
[03:17:14.125 --> 03:17:18.548]  He says just say he was a supporter of McGovern or Kennedy, repeats it over and over.
[03:17:18.608 --> 03:17:28.416]  Just put it out, just say you have it on unmistakable evidence, and then he orders them to leak that to the press and blame this Arthur Brimmer attempted assassination on the left.
[03:17:28.476 --> 03:17:29.437]  What do we see today?
[03:17:30.017 --> 03:17:43.106]  We see Democratic opportunists blaming on the right-wing media so they can bring in this draconian legislation, demonize talk radio, assault the First Amendment, and attempt a new branding of gun control.
[03:17:43.686 --> 03:17:44.346]  It's disgusting.
[03:17:44.386 --> 03:17:46.268]  It's the Rahm Emanuel-Nixon playbook.
[03:17:47.168 --> 03:17:55.554]  It is, and didn't... We know Cheney and Bush and others came up with Nixon, but wasn't Rove in there with Nixon as well?
[03:17:57.347 --> 03:17:58.807]  Yeah, well, he was a student at the time.
[03:17:58.847 --> 03:18:05.329]  He did college-level student tricks, and that's around the time that George Bush noticed him and said, hey, this guy's a good kind of opportunist.
[03:18:05.349 --> 03:18:07.550]  Yeah, then they made him the head of the Young Republicans and all that.
[03:18:08.010 --> 03:18:10.430]  Yeah, so he was involved, but not at the high levels yet.
[03:18:11.030 --> 03:18:12.571]  They were very proud of his dirty tricks, though.
[03:18:13.511 --> 03:18:14.191]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:18:14.311 --> 03:18:18.232]  And then, you know, Howard Hahn on a slightly higher level, doing all kinds of dirty tricks.
[03:18:18.252 --> 03:18:20.693]  Hey, what do you think of this new news about the Brad...
[03:18:21.849 --> 03:18:22.970]  Metzler or Meltzler.
[03:18:23.711 --> 03:18:29.236]  I'm pretty shocked to learn that he's in the news now saying he's best buddies with George Herbert Walker Bush, the Bohemian Grove guy.
[03:18:29.296 --> 03:18:33.260]  And he's on radio making fun of the conspiracy theorists that are on his show.
[03:18:33.640 --> 03:18:37.484]  While they advertised it was a big open fair show and all this, I should have known better.
[03:18:37.744 --> 03:18:40.026]  But you know, I don't turn down challenges.
[03:18:40.066 --> 03:18:43.169]  I get on the field, even if it's a rigged fight, because I want the fight.
[03:18:43.209 --> 03:18:46.873]  But boy, that's going to be creepy coming out the 27th on History Channel.
[03:18:47.338 --> 03:18:54.679]  I haven't heard that about Meltzer and Bush, but the few minutes I've seen of that show was very disingenuous, and I hope that's not the case with the other episodes.
[03:18:55.660 --> 03:19:01.801]  Well, I mean, now he's in USA Today doing Illuminati signs in front of the temples.
[03:19:02.701 --> 03:19:05.501]  He is saying he's in the inner circle.
[03:19:05.541 --> 03:19:09.482]  These buddies with George Herbert Walker Bush helped him write this new book called The Inner Circle.
[03:19:09.962 --> 03:19:13.203]  And so we've got this guy who's hanging out with the Bohemian Grove, Grand Poobah.
[03:19:15.273 --> 03:19:20.438]  And he's in other radio interviews making fun of the conspiracy theorist, but then while admitting all this is going on.
[03:19:21.659 --> 03:19:26.244]  So they do a limited hangout while blaming the crazy, delusional conspiracy theorist.
[03:19:27.267 --> 03:19:28.208]  It's kind of the pattern, right?
[03:19:28.228 --> 03:19:31.030]  Yeah, I mean, I am just, uh, I mean, I mean, I should know better.
[03:19:31.430 --> 03:19:44.921]  I mean, I'll tell you, History Channel, any production they're involved in, the 9-11 piece with them, I mean, they would wait till we had like an hour intermission for lunch and shoot the crowd when no one was there and then cut back to me as if I spoke to no one.
[03:19:45.501 --> 03:19:49.605]  I mean, it's just, but that's not the Patty Meltzer, Brad Meltzer.
[03:19:50.025 --> 03:19:51.446]  Aaron, great job on this report.
[03:19:51.466 --> 03:19:52.507]  Keep up the great research.
[03:19:52.547 --> 03:19:57.852]  It's wonderful having Aaron here in the house with all of his deep research into everything, tying it in to current events.
[03:19:57.892 --> 03:19:58.473]  We'll be right back.
[03:19:58.493 --> 03:19:58.893]  Stay with us.
[03:20:00.795 --> 03:20:04.718]  Becoming a modern smoker is now easier and more cost-effective, thanks to Lecithin.
