[00:00:03.476 --> 00:00:18.745]  For more than 60 years, the federal government in the United States, as well as many other governments across the planet, have carried out an elaborate hoax designed to convince the public that fluoride is added to most water supplies to improve oral hygiene.
[00:00:19.565 --> 00:00:21.466]  This report will examine the facts.
[00:00:21.947 --> 00:00:27.631]  Hundreds of chemicals are added to municipal water supplies, all under the name fluoride.
[00:00:28.011 --> 00:00:36.857]  Sodium fluoride and its variants are the chemical byproducts of aluminum fertilizer, cement, steel, and nuclear weapons manufacturing.
[00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:44.523]  Children who ingest fluoride will actually get a form of tooth decay called dental fluorosis.
[00:00:45.063 --> 00:00:47.285]  Dark brown stains and tooth decay.
[00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.293]  The American Dental Association recently put out a nationwide alert.
[00:00:52.634 --> 00:00:58.579]  In the memo, they warned parents not to make baby formula using fluoridated water.
[00:00:59.551 --> 00:01:04.192]  Fluoride is the active ingredient in many pesticides, like rat poison.
[00:01:04.872 --> 00:01:10.974]  Fluoride has been proven to cause brain damage, reduced IQ, impairs memory and learning.
[00:01:11.274 --> 00:01:14.854]  It has been conclusively shown to cause damage in the kidneys.
[00:01:15.254 --> 00:01:23.696]  It has been directly linked to bone disease, bone cancer, reduced thyroid activity, and it has also been proven that it's linked to other cancers.
[00:01:24.196 --> 00:01:26.517]  Unfortunately, this is only the beginning.
[00:01:26.917 --> 00:01:32.229]  Of the list of medical issues directly related to the ingestion of fluoride.
[00:01:34.975 --> 00:01:43.940]  After years of attempting to get the city of Austin to allow our crew in to show the deadly poison-filled fluoride tanks, we were finally allowed to.
[00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:51.104]  But the tour guide at the water treatment plant told us that it was their policy that we not shoot video.
[00:01:51.464 --> 00:01:59.668]  Well, it's our policy to show the people of Central Texas and the world who are being forcibly fluoridated to see the truth.
[00:01:59.908 --> 00:02:02.069]  It is our policy to resist tyranny.
[00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:03.110]  So here's the footage.
[00:02:04.684 --> 00:02:07.366]  So there's tank two and tank one.
[00:02:07.546 --> 00:02:18.536]  And this is a discharge line and a return line.
[00:02:19.932 --> 00:02:27.396]  A tour guide even jokingly pointed out the fact that the fluoride acid would eat holes in the concrete and paint.
[00:02:27.416 --> 00:02:29.217]  See this corrosion here?
[00:02:29.698 --> 00:02:31.799]  This is not corroding just from the air.
[00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:34.320]  This is from acid vapors in here, okay?
[00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.622]  So they've had to go in and it looks like replace this, okay?
[00:02:37.642 --> 00:02:39.123]  They had to take it out, it looks like.
[00:02:39.903 --> 00:02:47.948]  Here you can see the pipes where they lovingly pump the carcinogenic brain-eating chemical weapon into you and your children's water supply.
[00:02:49.457 --> 00:02:57.220]  This type of fluoride-based acid has the CDC's highest danger rating of number 4.
[00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:04.463]  Again, it is in the most dangerous class of chemicals with an MSDS health rating of 4.
[00:03:04.863 --> 00:03:05.804]  Life-threatening.
[00:03:06.164 --> 00:03:10.706]  Major or permanent damage may result from a single or repeated exposure.
[00:03:11.146 --> 00:03:12.046]  Organ failure.
[00:03:12.346 --> 00:03:12.946]  Cancer.
[00:03:13.247 --> 00:03:15.387]  The list goes on and on.
[00:03:16.128 --> 00:03:19.089]  All purposely pumped into your water supply.
[00:03:22.142 --> 00:03:29.625]  If sodium fluoride and its other variants are so dangerous, then why are more than 70% of U.S.
[00:03:29.725 --> 00:03:34.547]  cities forcing it on their citizens as a form of forced medication?
[00:03:34.987 --> 00:03:42.510]  Eugenics is the long-standing plan of population control and domination being quietly carried out by those who are determined
[00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.991]  To bring about a one world government and a new world order.
[00:03:46.251 --> 00:03:51.714]  Fluoride was used by the Nazis to poison the water in the concentration camps and slave labor camps.
[00:03:52.254 --> 00:03:58.996]  The Nazis knew that the brain damaging effects of fluoride would enable them to control the populations with more ease.
[00:03:59.517 --> 00:04:04.899]  Today, fluoride is being forced upon Americans in more than 70% of the country.
[00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:07.800]  This is not law, it is a federal mandate.
[00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.262]  Because the population is becoming aware and medical doctors are speaking out,
[00:04:12.822 --> 00:04:23.932]  The feds are now lobbying states like Arkansas to pass laws commanding local governments to add high levels of sodium fluoride to their water supplies.
[00:04:24.452 --> 00:04:34.621]  As Americans are becoming more educated about the issue, many activists are standing up to water fluoridation and laying the groundwork for taking it out of their water supply.
[00:04:35.382 --> 00:04:39.187]  Dr. Paul Conant is the Executive Director of the Fluoride Action Network.
[00:04:39.407 --> 00:04:47.237]  Thanks to Dr. Conant's efforts, the Calgary City Council voted 10 to 3 to remove toxic substances from their public drinking water.
[00:04:47.904 --> 00:04:55.929]  A few days ago it was finalized that Calgary in Alberta, that's 1.1 million people, are now going to be fluoride free.
[00:04:56.309 --> 00:04:58.110]  Now many other cities in the U.S.
[00:04:58.471 --> 00:05:00.392]  and across the world are following suit.
[00:05:00.952 --> 00:05:03.274]  And that's why the establishment is striking back.
[00:05:03.874 --> 00:05:12.539]  Tim Cameron of Mount Clemens City, Michigan, proposed to his city council to have all fluoride removed from the tap water, and won with a 6-0 vote.
[00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:20.472]  Motion to approve a resolution rescinding the addition of fluoride at the City of Mount Clemens Water Filtration Plant.
[00:05:20.572 --> 00:05:21.493]  I need a motion please.
[00:05:22.253 --> 00:05:28.356]  Motion to approve a resolution rescinding the addition of fluoride at the City of Mount Clemens Water Filtration Plant.
[00:05:28.676 --> 00:05:29.056]  Second.
[00:05:29.937 --> 00:05:30.877]  Campbell?
[00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:31.277]  Yes.
[00:05:31.357 --> 00:05:31.718]  Draeger?
[00:05:31.878 --> 00:05:32.118]  Yes.
[00:05:32.238 --> 00:05:32.638]  Gajer?
[00:05:32.718 --> 00:05:32.978]  Yes.
[00:05:33.138 --> 00:05:33.398]  Hill?
[00:05:33.739 --> 00:05:33.999]  Yes.
[00:05:34.079 --> 00:05:34.419]  Jones?
[00:05:34.519 --> 00:05:34.759]  Yes.
[00:05:34.899 --> 00:05:35.219]  Blesch?
[00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:35.699]  Yes.
[00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:36.760]  Motion to pass unanimously.
[00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:42.616]  That's what one man did by simply presenting the scientific facts to his council.
[00:05:43.117 --> 00:05:53.733]  State Representative Dr. Joe Hensley of Tennessee sent letters to every district in his state urging them to stop adding fluoride to the drinking water and has had very successful results.
[00:05:55.146 --> 00:06:05.636]  In future reports we will document the fact that under the name fluoride upwards of 300 plus chemicals are legally added to your water supply.
[00:06:06.116 --> 00:06:15.845]  Americans are forced to drink a literal toxic waste stew that is left over from different industries who would have to pay to store the toxic waste.
[00:06:16.105 --> 00:06:18.167]  Instead our cities in some cases
[00:06:18.407 --> 00:06:20.928]  Pay millions of dollars a year for the poison.
[00:06:21.348 --> 00:06:26.090]  The good news is people all over the world, not just the United States, are waking up.
[00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:33.553]  Right here in Austin, we're seeing more and more restaurants advertising that they have fluoride-free, healthy, clean, filtered water.
[00:06:33.873 --> 00:06:38.095]  Our reporter, Darren McBreen, traveled to one of these restaurants to talk to the owner.
[00:06:38.395 --> 00:06:39.055]  Darren McBreen.
