[00:00:05.557 --> 00:00:06.858]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.858 --> 00:00:08.640]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.381]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.381 --> 00:00:11.983]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.983 --> 00:00:13.524]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.524 --> 00:00:17.708]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.708 --> 00:00:21.811]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.268 --> 00:00:33.391]  It is Tuesday, the 25th day of January, 2011.
[00:00:33.391 --> 00:00:37.976]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:39.742 --> 00:00:45.084]  And joining us on the broadcast is the host of the show, Decoded.
[00:00:45.084 --> 00:00:49.245]  He'll be popping in later in the next hour, reportedly, Brad Meltzer.
[00:00:49.245 --> 00:00:57.307]  And then, our interview got cut off short because she got time zones messed up.
[00:00:57.307 --> 00:01:03.069]  Phyllis Schlafly will be joining us, the founder of the Eagle Forum, coming up in the last 30 minutes of the broadcast today.
[00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:10.774]  To talk about the future of this country and are we really going to see change out of this Republican House of Representatives?
[00:01:10.774 --> 00:01:15.498]  And what's going to happen if they don't deliver on fully repealing Obamacare?
[00:01:15.498 --> 00:01:26.867]  Or what's going to happen if they go along with Obama, who Mr. Gibbs said yesterday at the White House briefing, will be pushing gun grabbing, victim disarmament tonight in the State of the Union.
[00:01:26.867 --> 00:01:30.810]  So she'll be popping in with us in the last 30 minutes of the broadcast.
[00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.452]  We're going to have open phones throughout
[00:01:34.312 --> 00:01:38.314]  We had a chilling phone call at the end of the broadcast yesterday from a man who had been in the military.
[00:01:59.964 --> 00:02:15.753]  in the Army and then in the National Guard assigned to the State Guard in the Northwest for martial law takeover drills and to set up checkpoints and run people's driver's license and license plate and then put them in the backs of Army trucks.
[00:02:15.753 --> 00:02:19.415]  Now what was so chilling about the phone call is I have been to
[00:02:21.443 --> 00:02:21.984]  More than 15.
[00:02:21.984 --> 00:02:24.266]  I was trying to count it up in my mind last night.
[00:02:24.266 --> 00:02:32.775]  Instead of counting sheep going to bed at midnight, I was trying to count how many urban warfare drills I've been to, where they're openly training to put Americans in FEMA camps.
[00:02:32.775 --> 00:02:39.282]  And now you know about the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, the 10 regional FEMA governors, Rex 84.
[00:02:40.743 --> 00:02:46.208]  The Emergency Centers Act, the Model States Emergency Powers Act.
[00:02:46.208 --> 00:02:51.434]  What was so chilling from hearing from him is that there's no way he could fake that and not be telling the truth.
[00:02:51.434 --> 00:02:59.341]  Because everything he was saying on air, I've separately confirmed myself and reverse engineered from the public record and from attending these events.
[00:03:01.294 --> 00:03:02.615]  Some of which were unannounced.
[00:03:02.615 --> 00:03:10.661]  I just got tips from inside police departments in the military and was able to jump on airplanes or get in the car and drive to cover those.
[00:03:10.661 --> 00:03:24.892]  But just to hear it from a member of the military and how when they would ask questions about the role players saying, I'm an American, I'm your uncle, I'm your dad, I go to church with your wife, but they're still taken out of their car at the checkpoint and put in the army truck.
[00:03:24.892 --> 00:03:27.854]  To hear that really brings it home how serious it is and how
[00:03:28.695 --> 00:03:35.619]  They were immediately kicking them out of the National Guard and the State Guard if they even asked questions.
[00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:39.641]  The same thing is done, obviously, with the TSA.
[00:03:39.641 --> 00:03:49.666]  And we've confirmed, we first got reports of it from callers, and then we confirmed and saw blurbs in the news that they called the TSA in and said, you have a problem with the radiation from these scanners?
[00:03:49.666 --> 00:03:52.167]  You have a problem sticking your hands down people's pants?
[00:03:52.167 --> 00:03:55.589]  And if you have any problem, I tell you, thank you very much.
[00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:58.210]  And about a week later, you get your pink slip, you're laid off.
[00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.502]  This is how they're doing it.
[00:04:00.502 --> 00:04:04.931]  This is how they're building an army of police, military, and TSA...
[00:04:06.311 --> 00:04:13.016]  Government, not even police officers, not even sworn officers, goon squads who know nothing about the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:04:13.016 --> 00:04:19.760]  They're just creating a new brown shirt brigade that really believes they're protecting us from terrorism and now rolling them out on the streets.
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:35.652]  And we also have it in the clergy response teams and the InfraGard reports that have come out, the documents we've received, that they are preparing for a total takeover in a hot form, not a cold form of creeping tyranny and slow martial law, but building up towards a hot
[00:04:36.252 --> 00:04:41.033]  Marshall Law, a mass roundup with the red list, the blue list, and the rest of it.
[00:04:41.033 --> 00:04:55.457]  Now, we've got to get the word out about this, speak out against it, and say no to it, because it's so brazenly tyrannical, so illegal, so unconstitutional, so treasonous, that if we stand up and aren't intimidated by this and speak out against it, they won't get away with it.
[00:04:55.457 --> 00:04:57.978]  But they're beta testing it right now.
[00:04:57.978 --> 00:05:00.419]  We'll be right back with big news on the TSA in Ventura.
[00:05:02.142 --> 00:05:06.166]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:05:06.166 --> 00:05:09.409]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:14.193]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:05:14.193 --> 00:05:20.599]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:22.842]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:05:23.362 --> 00:05:24.863]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:05:24.863 --> 00:05:26.143]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:05:26.143 --> 00:05:28.384]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:49.553]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:05:49.553 --> 00:05:58.656]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv

[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.842]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[00:06:24.842 --> 00:06:31.369]  Since 1947, Calbin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.

[00:06:55.629 --> 00:06:56.089]  Thank you!
[00:07:00.421 --> 00:07:04.964]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:07:04.964 --> 00:07:05.884]  Number one.
[00:07:05.884 --> 00:07:09.307]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:07:09.307 --> 00:07:10.167]  Number two.
[00:07:10.167 --> 00:07:15.050]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:15.811]  It's true.
[00:07:15.811 --> 00:07:20.674]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:07:20.674 --> 00:07:21.494]  Number three.
[00:07:21.494 --> 00:07:25.097]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:07:25.097 --> 00:07:28.799]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:07:28.979 --> 00:07:29.779]  Number 4.
[00:07:29.779 --> 00:07:32.540]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:36.222]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:07:36.222 --> 00:07:37.022]  Number 5.
[00:07:37.022 --> 00:07:41.164]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:07:41.164 --> 00:07:46.226]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:07:46.226 --> 00:07:50.387]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:50.387 --> 00:07:52.188]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:52.188 --> 00:07:56.770]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[00:08:04.192 --> 00:08:10.775]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:08:10.775 --> 00:08:14.676]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[00:08:22.276 --> 00:08:33.324]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:33.324 --> 00:08:36.967]  We are locked and loaded, ready to go in the info war.
[00:08:36.967 --> 00:08:40.449]  Thank you for joining us on this live Tuesday edition, the 25th day of January 2011.
[00:08:45.708 --> 00:08:52.910]  We're going to have open phones for first-time callers, at least in the first hour and a half ahead of several informative guests that we have joining us.
[00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:56.211]  The toll-free number to get involved on air is 800-259-9231.
[00:08:56.211 --> 00:08:56.431]  800-259-9231.
[00:08:56.431 --> 00:08:58.271]  Okay.
[00:08:58.271 --> 00:09:10.894]  Obviously, I'm going to talk some about the State of the Union coming up tonight with Barry Sotaro, aka Barack Obama.
[00:09:10.894 --> 00:09:14.175]  The White House Press Secretary confirmed what we reported on a week ago.
[00:09:15.746 --> 00:09:16.086]  on that.
[00:09:35.325 --> 00:09:37.387]  A lot of other big facets coming up.
[00:09:37.387 --> 00:09:47.657]  A real constitutional split with the Supreme Court justices, at least two of them reporting that they're not going to be attending tonight because Obama singled them out and excoriated them, which is
[00:09:48.936 --> 00:09:57.001]  Just an amazing thing to do via the separation of powers, completely unconstitutional in the spirit of what he did at the last State of the Union.
[00:09:57.001 --> 00:10:03.305]  We're going to be going over that important stack and I'd love to hear from you on your views ahead of State of the Union.
[00:10:03.305 --> 00:10:11.470]  We're also being told that the big push is going to be some new campaign slogans that are going to be rolled out.
[00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:17.674]  It's a Republican slogan used on the West Coast in Oregon and Washington and that's confirmed, but he's stealing it.
[00:10:18.875 --> 00:10:24.116]  And the headline here in roll call is Republican Owns Obama's Win the Future.
[00:10:24.116 --> 00:10:28.717]  And that's another spin or variant of hope and change.
[00:10:28.717 --> 00:10:42.201]  Let the confidence men just drag you and string us along a little bit longer while the banks consolidate their global government run through their 1.5 quadrillion in derivatives.
[00:10:42.201 --> 00:10:44.501]  So that is coming up.
[00:10:44.501 --> 00:10:47.622]  Huge unrest via what's more and more looking like
[00:10:48.982 --> 00:10:56.704]  NATO slash CIA instituted operations, of course, from Tunisia to Egypt into Yemen.
[00:10:56.704 --> 00:11:01.466]  Serious riots exploding all over that area of the world.
[00:11:01.466 --> 00:11:08.748]  Many of these countries, so-called allies of the Anglo-American establishment or the West.
[00:11:08.748 --> 00:11:14.609]  Another chilling article by Paul Joseph Watson up at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:11:14.609 --> 00:11:15.830]  Carnegie Endowment
[00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:22.593]  That's one of the top globalist tax-free foundations openly pushing world government now for a hundred plus years.
[00:11:22.593 --> 00:11:28.416]  Carnegie touts green credentials of Genghis Khan for slaughtering 40 million people.
[00:11:28.416 --> 00:11:36.719]  I'll never forget the 1996 UN Biological Diversity Assessment where it talked about we must reduce the world population by 80%.
[00:11:36.719 --> 00:11:41.562]  We show screenshots of that public assessment in my film Road to Tyranny, now out for nine years.
[00:11:42.921 --> 00:11:43.001]  And
[00:12:04.073 --> 00:12:04.233]  I don't
[00:12:23.712 --> 00:12:27.438]  And Infowars.com, Lauding Genghis Khan.
[00:12:27.438 --> 00:12:32.925]  I mean, these reports now come out almost every day as they openly explain what they're doing.
[00:12:32.925 --> 00:12:37.292]  It's not like the globalists have to get over some moral compulsion to not kill.
[00:12:37.292 --> 00:12:38.514]  They see it as moral.
[00:12:40.066 --> 00:12:56.039]  Of course, it came out that the Earth First Battalion back in the 1970s and 80s at the Pentagon, it got whitewashed to a great extent by the Men Who Stare at Goats movie with George Clooney and others.
[00:12:57.403 --> 00:13:02.586]  But in the Earth First Battalion, and you can pull these up, it's at any library, it was published by the U.S.
[00:13:02.586 --> 00:13:05.027]  Army, they say, we are the pale horse death.
[00:13:05.027 --> 00:13:08.669]  We bring death worldwide, you know, bring in the world government.
[00:13:08.669 --> 00:13:11.811]  I mean, this is just amazing, amazing stuff.
[00:13:11.811 --> 00:13:14.372]  The first time I saw this was about 13 years ago.
[00:13:14.372 --> 00:13:18.014]  Tex Marsh let me dig through his giant archives at his office, and I first saw
[00:13:18.114 --> 00:13:19.575]  But the first thing I want to get into today
[00:13:46.212 --> 00:14:06.728]  is an article that Aaron Dykes and I wrote together last night and I actually just gave Aaron the research notes and the points I wanted to be made and Aaron did the lion's share of putting out this excellent report that is up at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com if you're watching or listening
[00:14:08.908 --> 00:14:21.936]  On the radio or at PrisonPlanet.tv right now, you can go over to DrudgeReport.com and it is the very top link on the Drudge Report, the number one alternative news site in the world.
[00:14:21.936 --> 00:14:27.439]  Ventura strikes back with lawsuit against TSA.
[00:14:27.439 --> 00:14:36.224]  The inside story from Alex Jones about the former governor's humiliating pat-down experiences that included touching
[00:14:39.056 --> 00:14:46.704]  Groping, gripping, and rubbing the genitals at the hands of the TSA.
[00:14:46.704 --> 00:14:50.668]  And of course he talked about this and broke the news here in November.
[00:14:52.082 --> 00:15:03.692]  That he was not going to be flying anymore and that basically his career in television producing TV shows was over because he is not going to ever fly again.
[00:15:03.692 --> 00:15:07.115]  And he did not fly down to Mexico for the winter.
[00:15:07.115 --> 00:15:12.720]  He drove his RV through the snowstorms in Minnesota in late December and traveled down there.
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:16.042]  And back at the time I had him back on early December.
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:17.120]  And
[00:15:38.902 --> 00:15:52.530]  And so John Harmon heard it and the crew heard it, but no one else did, that he was initiating the lawsuit in early 2011, but obviously not to tell anybody about it until the lawsuit had been launched.
[00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:55.611]  And I said, well, hopefully we can get you on once this happens.
[00:15:55.611 --> 00:15:58.113]  And he said, well, you know, I don't do media when I'm in Mexico.
[00:15:58.113 --> 00:16:02.695]  But he said, I might do your show, but let's wait and see.
[00:16:02.695 --> 00:16:07.578]  And then he said he can go into town and maybe get on a phone line and call in because he lives
[00:16:08.118 --> 00:16:08.459]  I don't
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:42.354]  I was on the other line actually with Aaron going through the article that we published in the early morning hours today and he said well he'll work on getting him on the show in the next few days or in the next week but regardless that if I give Tyrell questions
[00:16:42.594 --> 00:16:49.459]  Well, I actually have Jesse's email down there, but he's got to go into town to get it, that Jesse will write a statement for the show, bare minimum.
[00:16:49.459 --> 00:16:50.780]  But we already have his statement.
[00:16:50.780 --> 00:17:01.327]  It's what's in the lawsuit, and it's what he said in November and December when he broke on this show that he was no longer going to be traveling because he couldn't subject himself to the sexual humiliation.
[00:17:01.327 --> 00:17:03.128]  There's already precedent here now.
[00:17:03.128 --> 00:17:04.329]  A woman in Texas
[00:17:05.168 --> 00:17:05.408]  This is
[00:17:23.763 --> 00:17:26.005]  Because they fire everybody that's human.
[00:17:26.005 --> 00:17:27.446]  They fire everybody that's got a soul.
[00:17:27.446 --> 00:17:35.994]  They fire anybody who understands that ripping colostomy bags off people, or urology bags, or making... They make people who can't walk.
[00:17:35.994 --> 00:17:37.075]  I've seen this.
[00:17:37.075 --> 00:17:47.484]  They order them to get up, and old men and women who look like they are five seconds from death, two minutes from midnight, can't get up, and then they make passengers pick them up.
[00:17:48.806 --> 00:17:56.009]  I mean, these are people that are incredibly fragile, that could break bones or pull muscles just getting from their wheelchair to a toilet.
[00:17:56.009 --> 00:17:59.471]  And they're always going to visit their family one more time.
[00:17:59.471 --> 00:18:10.315]  Once I saw, in 2003, I was in a San Francisco airport and they had private security on top of TSA at the gate searching people again, not just at the checkpoint.
[00:18:10.315 --> 00:18:14.437]  And I saw a group of World War II survivors
[00:18:15.848 --> 00:18:15.908]  I'm
[00:18:29.673 --> 00:18:35.378]  You know, the flesh around his eyes, the eyelids were drooping down and all red and dripping.
[00:18:35.378 --> 00:18:42.123]  I mean, you've all seen that with somebody who looks like they're 90 years old and, you know, smoked two packs of cigarettes a day.
[00:18:42.123 --> 00:18:44.505]  And they were all wearing their World War II garb.
[00:18:44.505 --> 00:18:49.008]  They were all wearing their hats of what unit they were in, Marines, Navy.
[00:18:49.008 --> 00:18:51.911]  And it was a whole group of them.
[00:18:51.911 --> 00:18:56.955]  And it was these foreigners who could barely speak English in these weird Cobra Commander-type
[00:18:58.092 --> 00:18:58.272]  Right.
[00:19:17.105 --> 00:19:20.967]  Stopped flying for leisure at that point.
[00:19:20.967 --> 00:19:27.151]  And I rarely flew places to visit family or to go on a vacation, but at that point, I've never flown since for leisure.
[00:19:27.151 --> 00:19:38.959]  Only when I absolutely have to because I was sitting there watching this and every bone in my body wanted to go over and get that guy by the shoulders and say, get your hands off these old men.
[00:19:38.959 --> 00:19:45.903]  Can't you see they're on the edge of death here, fighting to go to one more reunion at Pearl Harbor.
[00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:54.246]  I was waiting at another gate to fly back to Austin and there was the plane about to take off to Hawaii and Ventura sees that.
[00:19:54.246 --> 00:19:56.368]  Ventura and I witnessed that at airports together.
[00:19:56.368 --> 00:19:57.930]  He gets very upset by it.
[00:19:57.930 --> 00:19:59.091]  I'll tell you about it all when we come back.
[00:20:02.501 --> 00:20:06.965]  Fight back this cold and flu season with the world's best garlic extract, Ali-C.
[00:20:06.965 --> 00:20:07.825]  Why Ali-C?
[00:20:07.825 --> 00:20:11.408]  Because it helps your body fight viruses, bacteria, and fungi.

[00:20:19.455 --> 00:20:25.042]  Alley C contains 300 milligrams of stabilized allicin, the active ingredient in crushed garlic.
[00:20:25.042 --> 00:20:30.248]  Studies show Alley C is effective against MRSA, bacterial, fungal, and viral infections.
[00:20:30.248 --> 00:20:33.952]  One tablet of Alley C has the equivalent of 40 cloves of garlic.
[00:20:33.952 --> 00:20:40.099]  Alley C supports your body's resistance to all types of conditions and can help lower high blood pressure and high cholesterol.

[00:21:00.735 --> 00:21:01.536]  Gold.
[00:21:01.536 --> 00:21:03.057]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[00:21:03.057 --> 00:21:09.322]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:21:09.322 --> 00:21:13.505]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:21:13.505 --> 00:21:15.447]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:21:15.447 --> 00:21:17.888]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[00:21:17.888 --> 00:21:24.974]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every year.
[00:21:24.994 --> 00:21:25.895]  We're good to go.
[00:21:49.755 --> 00:21:50.515]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:21:50.515 --> 00:21:54.438]  citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:21:54.438 --> 00:21:56.379]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:21:56.379 --> 00:21:59.341]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children.
[00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:16.111]  And even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:22:16.111 --> 00:22:19.072]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:22:19.072 --> 00:22:21.393]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:22:21.393 --> 00:22:27.675]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Danny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:22:27.675 --> 00:22:31.076]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:22:31.076 --> 00:22:36.898]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:22:36.898 --> 00:22:38.539]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:22:38.539 --> 00:22:39.859]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:22:39.859 --> 00:22:42.380]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:46.763]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:22:46.763 --> 00:22:51.326]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:22:51.326 --> 00:22:53.928]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[00:23:03.475 --> 00:23:07.258]  My name is Span, and I'm 68 years old, and I live in Vermont.
[00:23:07.665 --> 00:23:12.409]  In the spring of 2003, I started to have problems with my heart.
[00:23:12.409 --> 00:23:14.310]  It felt like my heart was pounding.
[00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:16.212]  It made me feel breathless.
[00:23:16.212 --> 00:23:20.655]  I tried many, many different things to try to get some help for myself.
[00:23:20.655 --> 00:23:21.736]  Nothing did anything.
[00:23:21.736 --> 00:23:25.719]  Heart and Body Extract is very powerful, very effective, and works quickly.
[00:23:25.719 --> 00:23:29.843]  I saw one of Sharon's ads and ordered Heart and Body Extract.
[00:23:29.843 --> 00:23:32.465]  I noticed a difference quickly, within days.
[00:23:32.925 --> 00:23:37.927]  The episodes became less frequent and by a month had completely vanished.
[00:23:37.927 --> 00:23:40.748]  Usually you find a 30 day or 60 day guarantee.

[00:24:36.443 --> 00:24:41.126]  We're coming straight on for the TSA and the DHS occupation of America.
[00:24:41.126 --> 00:24:43.308]  They can't arrest us or get us all.
[00:24:43.308 --> 00:24:44.288]  We are the people.
[00:24:44.288 --> 00:24:45.389]  We are America.
[00:24:45.389 --> 00:24:47.190]  We are the Constitution.
[00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:58.498]  We are the Bill of Rights, and we're standing up against the offshore banks taking this country over and looting it, and the congressional prostitutes that they bought and paid for to help bring this nation into tyranny.
[00:24:59.398 --> 00:25:02.020]  We don't have a choice fighting these terrorists.
[00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:05.322]  We are going to expose them, and we're not gonna shut up.
[00:25:05.322 --> 00:25:07.523]  We're not gonna lower the tone of our rhetoric.
[00:25:07.523 --> 00:25:12.666]  We are the people in the spirit of 1776, and we're taking our republic back.
[00:25:12.666 --> 00:25:19.370]  So again, top link on DrudgeReport.com, one of the top links at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:22.752]  Ventura strikes back with lawsuit against TSA.
[00:25:22.752 --> 00:25:28.396]  The inside story from Alex Jones about the former governor's humiliating pat-down experiences that included touching,
[00:25:28.976 --> 00:25:29.918]  We're good to go.
[00:25:44.565 --> 00:25:49.227]  And he gets even more upset watching them force people in wheelchairs to get up.
[00:25:49.227 --> 00:25:55.309]  And it is just a nightmare situation, especially in Atlanta, where I witnessed it go on for about eight minutes.
[00:25:55.309 --> 00:25:57.250]  And he started speaking up against it.
[00:25:57.250 --> 00:26:00.051]  And the TSA was giggling and smirking and thought it was a lot of fun.
[00:26:00.051 --> 00:26:01.531]  And they all knew exactly who he was.
[00:26:01.531 --> 00:26:03.472]  And a bunch of people gathered around.
[00:26:03.472 --> 00:26:10.735]  And because he spoke out against it, they took their time humiliating him, letting him know that government owns him, that he has no private space.
[00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:28.310]  Former Governor Jesse Ventura has taken steps, he's actually filed a suit against the TSA and the Department of Homeland Security, naming their chiefs John Pistole and big sis Janet Napolitano in a lawsuit that will take on invasive airport pat-downs.
[00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:33.333]  And then we have a link there in the article to the lawsuit if you want to read it, to the federal lawsuit.
[00:26:34.053 --> 00:26:48.922]  Ventura first told Alex Jones of his intent to sue the TSA privately back in November while traveling for the making of TruTV's conspiracy theory, expressing grave concern about what he viewed as his country's transformation into East Germany.
[00:26:49.762 --> 00:27:03.889]  As far back as September, Ventura confided in Jones that his career was under threat and that he was considering abandoning travel altogether because of the fact that he was being harassed by TSA agents every single time he went through an airport security checkpoint.
[00:27:03.889 --> 00:27:07.991]  And I witnessed him, you know, on the phone telling the execs at TruTV, I can't do this anymore.
[00:27:07.991 --> 00:27:08.392]  I'm done.
[00:27:08.392 --> 00:27:09.672]  I can't travel.
[00:27:09.672 --> 00:27:10.253]  I can't go anywhere.
[00:27:10.253 --> 00:27:11.073]  I'm never flying again.
[00:27:11.073 --> 00:27:12.774]  And of course, he then announced that here on the air.
[00:27:15.626 --> 00:27:23.527]  Continuing, Jones recalls Ventura's outrage at the TSA's harassing old people in wheelchairs with the invasive new pat-down procedures.
[00:27:23.527 --> 00:27:31.029]  The former governor himself is routinely sent to secondary screening, every time he is, due to a hip replacement in 2008.
[00:27:31.029 --> 00:27:36.510]  And Jones witnessed him undergo repeated humiliating searches during pat-downs at the hands of the TSA.
[00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:44.871]  Worse, at airports across the country, even those presenting medical cards, which TSA is supposed to accept, describing special needs or equipment
[00:27:45.091 --> 00:27:50.091]  from a doctor are routinely ignored as TSA agents demand that medical patients remove
[00:27:52.298 --> 00:27:59.242]  Your astronomy bags, prosthetic breast, or the TSA be allowed to grope a pacemaker patient's breast.
[00:27:59.242 --> 00:28:02.064]  And we have links to all the mainstream articles about that.
[00:28:02.064 --> 00:28:05.786]  That's why I want to leave the United States, Ventura told Jones at the time.
[00:28:05.786 --> 00:28:08.068]  That's what he said to the TSA right in front of me.
[00:28:08.068 --> 00:28:12.790]  I was sitting there in the chair waiting for him to go through the rape down, the pat down, the grope down.
[00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:14.611]  This is why I go down to Mexico.
[00:28:14.611 --> 00:28:16.793]  This is wrong, he was saying to the TSA.
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:18.580]  I think so.
[00:28:31.567 --> 00:28:34.189]  In fact, I was sitting there taking photos with my iPhone.
[00:28:34.189 --> 00:28:36.890]  We went through the checkpoint, went and got food, and I said, look at these photos.
[00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:40.192]  And he goes, I'm glad you took them in case something happened.
[00:28:40.192 --> 00:28:43.774]  But nothing happened, so erase them.
[00:28:43.774 --> 00:28:45.355]  And I said, OK, and I erased them.
[00:28:45.355 --> 00:28:48.697]  But I had the photos on this iPhone, a whole bunch of them.
[00:28:48.697 --> 00:28:49.798]  This went on for like eight minutes.
[00:28:50.518 --> 00:28:51.139]  Probably longer.
[00:28:51.139 --> 00:28:53.264]  By the time I started timing it, it was eight minutes.
[00:28:53.264 --> 00:28:56.209]  I was just sitting there while they were, you know, hands between his legs all over.
[00:28:56.209 --> 00:29:01.099]  Would have been good evidence, but Ventura was embarrassed by it and wanted it erased.
[00:29:01.099 --> 00:29:02.281]  Would have helped with the suit, but...
[00:29:03.568 --> 00:29:06.030]  I mean, I told him about it, so he said get rid of them.
[00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:09.794]  But the point is, is that this went on and on and on.
[00:29:09.794 --> 00:29:15.078]  So telling the TSA, that's why I want to leave the United States, Ventura told Jones at the time.
[00:29:15.078 --> 00:29:16.840]  This is why I go down to Mexico.
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:18.982]  This is wrong, he told the TSA.
[00:29:18.982 --> 00:29:24.987]  Ventura indicated that he has, was most concerned about the destruction of the Fourth Amendment.
[00:29:26.522 --> 00:29:29.263]  And passing of the America he once knew.
[00:29:29.263 --> 00:29:37.507]  We're gonna come back and finish up with this article that chronicles just part of what I witnessed, but the issue here is people are standing up, they're saying no.
[00:29:37.507 --> 00:29:39.909]  The TSA is losing lawsuits.
[00:29:39.909 --> 00:29:41.409]  I told you about it in the last segment.
[00:29:41.409 --> 00:29:49.974]  The woman where they pulled her shirt off and her bra off and then they all went into like some type of sexual frenzy with her saying, oh baby, oh baby.
[00:29:51.397 --> 00:29:54.399]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.399 --> 00:29:58.002]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:04.812]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[00:30:04.812 --> 00:30:09.073]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[00:30:09.073 --> 00:30:13.775]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[00:30:13.775 --> 00:30:19.718]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[00:30:19.718 --> 00:30:22.959]  Not worried about them moving south.
[00:30:22.959 --> 00:30:26.941]  Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[00:30:29.509 --> 00:30:35.033]  I'm looking for America.
[00:30:35.033 --> 00:30:36.995]  We're American and be proud.
[00:30:36.995 --> 00:30:39.277]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[00:30:39.277 --> 00:30:43.340]  The land I left free and the home of the brave.
[00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:47.603]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[00:30:55.467 --> 00:31:01.052]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[00:31:01.052 --> 00:31:04.635]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:31:04.635 --> 00:31:05.936]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:31:05.936 --> 00:31:10.319]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:31:10.319 --> 00:31:16.264]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:31:16.264 --> 00:31:18.426]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:31:18.426 --> 00:31:21.108]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[00:31:21.448 --> 00:31:27.931]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoodsDirect.
[00:31:27.931 --> 00:31:30.152]  They both make fabulous investments.
[00:31:30.152 --> 00:31:35.495]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[00:31:35.495 --> 00:31:40.777]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[00:31:40.777 --> 00:31:46.140]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:49.081]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.

[00:32:00.411 --> 00:32:01.572]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:32:01.572 --> 00:32:08.499]  citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:32:08.499 --> 00:32:10.761]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:32:11.041 --> 00:32:16.425]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:32:16.425 --> 00:32:19.447]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:32:19.447 --> 00:32:21.768]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:32:21.768 --> 00:32:28.032]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:32:28.032 --> 00:32:31.415]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:32:31.415 --> 00:32:37.198]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:32:37.198 --> 00:32:38.840]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:39.960]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:32:41.081 --> 00:32:42.782]  Watch this free video online today.
[00:32:42.782 --> 00:32:47.004]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:32:47.004 --> 00:32:51.625]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:32:51.625 --> 00:32:54.227]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:05.501]  Big Brother.
[00:33:05.501 --> 00:33:07.183]  Mainstream media.
[00:33:07.183 --> 00:33:08.564]  Government cover-ups.
[00:33:08.564 --> 00:33:09.826]  You want answers?
[00:33:09.826 --> 00:33:11.908]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:11.908 --> 00:33:16.272]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:16.272 --> 00:33:16.513]  Show!
[00:33:23.936 --> 00:33:28.877]  We have two articles up at InfoWars.com and ProsePunta.com.
[00:33:28.877 --> 00:33:48.442]  Not just the Ventura Strikes Back lawsuit against TSA, we have another one with the headline dealing with the fact that his lawsuit is getting into the issue of the fact that this is sexual abuse.
[00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:55.277]  And so we need to get these articles out to everyone out there that we can.
[00:33:55.277 --> 00:33:59.062]  But continuing with this article here.
[00:34:01.547 --> 00:34:13.879]  During one TSA pat-down procedure on Ventura that Jones witnessed at Atlanta International Airport, Ventura loudly proclaimed his disgust the United States had turned into East Germany, and that America he loved and served in the U.S.
[00:34:13.879 --> 00:34:18.303]  military was dead, while TSA agents conducting the pat-down merely smiled.
[00:34:18.303 --> 00:34:20.945]  They knew who Ventura was, and that he was a public figure.
[00:34:20.945 --> 00:34:22.567]  Yeah, a crowd gathered around.
[00:34:22.567 --> 00:34:23.147]  But still,
[00:34:23.968 --> 00:34:28.050]  Subjected the former governor to an eight minute plus invasive search.
[00:34:28.050 --> 00:34:32.232]  And when they call you out and put you in the glass box, it's all about humiliation.
[00:34:32.232 --> 00:34:34.333]  It's like having the dunce hat put on you.
[00:34:34.333 --> 00:34:39.135]  And this is all peer pressure that's being engaged in here.
[00:34:40.055 --> 00:34:51.345]  But as I said, if you go up to InfoWars.com, there's two articles by Paul Joseph Watson dealing with this, and two articles dealing with this from Aaron Dykes.
[00:34:51.345 --> 00:34:58.451]  The second article is Ventura lawsuit, TSA pat-downs classify as unlawful sexual abuse.
[00:34:59.312 --> 00:35:11.192]  And we need to get these out again to everyone so that people realize what's happening in this society and that all of this violates our constitutional rights in a big way.
[00:35:12.179 --> 00:35:22.183]  Continuing, Ventura filed his lawsuit Monday, January 24, 2011 in Minnesota, and news reports have named David Olson as his lawyer.
[00:35:22.183 --> 00:35:36.568]  The former governor has indicated that his suit will include violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Fourth Amendment, arguing that he and others with disabilities have been discriminated against and unduly signaled out by the TSA despite presenting no threat
[00:35:37.188 --> 00:35:40.029]  And warning, no reason for a lawful search.
[00:35:40.029 --> 00:35:47.833]  Further, Ventura has argued that his ability to travel freely has been infringed, hampering his ability to work.
[00:35:47.833 --> 00:35:51.734]  Yeah, they're destroying your right to travel, your right of passage.
[00:35:51.734 --> 00:35:58.357]  That's the first thing the Nazis did was set up internal checkpoints and ban certain groups from being able to engage in commerce.
[00:35:58.357 --> 00:36:00.098]  That's the same thing the Soviets did.
[00:36:00.098 --> 00:36:02.319]  That's how the Communist Chinese shut you down.
[00:36:02.319 --> 00:36:03.999]  That's what Fidel Castro does.
[00:36:03.999 --> 00:36:05.260]  This is a main tool
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:10.404]  of tyrants over and over again in history.
[00:36:10.404 --> 00:36:23.573]  Continuing here, in November 2010, Ventura vowed on the Alex Jones Show that he would never again fly on commercial aircraft so long as current TSA policies remain in place.
[00:36:23.573 --> 00:36:28.537]  It probably means an end to my career, Ventura lamented on the radio broadcast.
[00:36:28.537 --> 00:36:30.338]  We have a link to that video and audio.
[00:36:30.338 --> 00:36:32.700]  As the Drudge Report exposed months ago, Ventura
[00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:33.580]  I think?
[00:36:56.109 --> 00:37:08.896]  Offensive touching, gripping and rubbing of the genitals, and other sensitive areas of his body, which the lawsuit contends met the definition for an unlawful sexual assault.
[00:37:09.798 --> 00:37:18.261]  In November, Jesse Ventura confirmed to Alex Jones that he would be suing the TSA in the new year and would explain more once the suit was filed.
[00:37:18.261 --> 00:37:30.305]  Ventura is in the Baja area of Mexico, but Alex was told yesterday by his management that Ventura would be giving Jones a written statement and should be appearing on the Alex Jones Show in the near future if he's able to.
[00:37:31.275 --> 00:37:41.240]  Continuing, Homeland Security in the ever encroaching siren song of public safety is attempting to bar our right of free passage across the country.
[00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:48.783]  Those who refuse to cooperate with body scanners or pat-downs are told they will be arrested, detained, or fined, just as in Nazi Germany.
[00:37:48.783 --> 00:37:58.568]  We're increasingly geared towards internal passports where we must satisfy on-the-spot inspection or we refuse the ability to travel.
[00:37:59.068 --> 00:38:05.135]  And now it's expanding again to trains, buses, highways, TSA into Walmarts, DHS everywhere.
[00:38:05.135 --> 00:38:11.723]  They're running PSAs on TV about how they're going to be in the mall and at sports stadiums, you know, protecting you.
[00:38:11.723 --> 00:38:12.804]  We covered that last week.
[00:38:12.804 --> 00:38:15.027]  This is the rollout of the federal goon force.
[00:38:16.288 --> 00:38:19.090]  Tourism is down by the billions of dollars.
[00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:29.280]  Angry travel and vacation industry representatives told the TSA to back down, citing some 41 million potential flyers who avoided travel due to anxiety over airport security.
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:31.862]  But airports are only the leading phase.
[00:38:32.222 --> 00:38:40.426]  TSA Viper squads and mobile x-ray scanners are rolling out on the streets of America and train and bus stations, sports stadiums and shopping malls will be next.
[00:38:40.426 --> 00:38:49.370]  Homeland Security is unveiling 9,000 telescreens at 9,000 locations across America, including Walmart, to encourage people to spy on their neighbors.
[00:38:49.370 --> 00:38:52.771]  If anyone can stop the police state, it is the people of the United States.
[00:38:52.771 --> 00:38:54.992]  The bigger picture is looking more and more like 1984.
[00:38:54.992 --> 00:38:58.474]  It is vital that we resist these police state measures.
[00:38:59.983 --> 00:39:01.564]  And make our voices heard.
[00:39:01.564 --> 00:39:13.852]  We commend Governor Jesse Ventura for standing up to the TSA and using his prominent name to fight back against clear bullying and intimidation by the government agency trying to expand its mandate of power.
[00:39:13.852 --> 00:39:15.233]  Yeah, it's a power grab.
[00:39:15.233 --> 00:39:20.476]  Others have fought the TSA, including a man in Seattle who recently won his suit over the right to use a camera.
[00:39:20.476 --> 00:39:27.081]  Moreover, the TSA had to settle with an Amarillo, Texas woman after the agent shockingly exposed her breast and then laughed about it.
[00:39:27.681 --> 00:39:35.026]  The news reported in the suit reported they actually came up and said man I wish I'd have been part of that search, honey So that's again one of the articles.
[00:39:35.026 --> 00:39:54.659]  There's another article of Ventura lawsuit TSA Pat Downs classify as unlawful sexual abuse another article authored by Aaron Dyke solely this article Ventura strikes back with lawsuit against TSA is again Aaron Dykes and Alex Jones Please help us get this out to everyone.
[00:39:54.659 --> 00:39:57.101]  You know, it is so important
[00:39:57.841 --> 00:40:01.865]  That people realize the full spectrum of what's happening.
[00:40:01.865 --> 00:40:11.153]  Normally when you see a mainstream news article about the TSA, they only report on one tiny factor in the overall larger equation.
[00:40:11.153 --> 00:40:13.275]  One little fraction of it.
[00:40:13.275 --> 00:40:18.980]  This article is a full spectrum breakdown to give people the big picture, and that's why it's such a godsend that a juggernaut
[00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:20.261]  I think?
[00:40:36.414 --> 00:40:42.296]  I openly saw him announce that TSA is going to be all over America, that the airports were a beta test.
[00:40:42.296 --> 00:40:45.777]  So we knew what they were going to do and now it's happening.
[00:40:45.777 --> 00:40:50.578]  So for those marveling that we've accurately been able to break down the future, it's not hard.
[00:40:50.578 --> 00:40:52.239]  They told us what they would do.
[00:40:52.239 --> 00:40:54.140]  And there's no doubt this has nothing to do with security.
[00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:58.121]  It's about a federal power grab as they bring us into this orchestrated engineered depression.
[00:40:59.107 --> 00:41:00.828]  They're trying to end our way of life.
[00:41:00.828 --> 00:41:05.631]  This is a globalist revolution against liberty and freedom.
[00:41:05.631 --> 00:41:12.454]  Now, we also again have the lawsuit linked in the first paragraph of the article, if you want to read it in full.
[00:41:12.454 --> 00:41:15.616]  In the article, Ventura strikes back with lawsuit against TSA.
[00:41:15.616 --> 00:41:18.117]  It's also in the second Ventura article.
[00:41:18.117 --> 00:41:22.320]  Ventura lawsuit, TSA pat-downs classify as unlawful sexual
[00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:23.580]  I don't
[00:41:45.916 --> 00:41:46.516]  I don't know.
[00:42:06.082 --> 00:42:07.443]  Hi Alex, how you doing?
[00:42:07.443 --> 00:42:08.144]  I'm a first time caller.
[00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:38.146]  Um, and I just wanted to touch on something that I haven't heard a whole lot about lately, which is the thing called climate change.
[00:42:38.146 --> 00:42:55.736]  Um, I noticed, uh, we've been having a lot of, like, record cold temperatures and tons of snow, and one thing, uh, I've paid attention to is the mainstream media has not, um, been reporting on tying that in with the, um, you know, the weather, the cold weather, with the, um, climate change.
[00:42:55.736 --> 00:42:57.417]  And I was wondering what your take was on that.
[00:42:59.005 --> 00:43:04.629]  Well, look, there are thousands and thousands of many climates.
[00:43:04.629 --> 00:43:16.018]  I forget the number that's broken down by the different global atmospheric and oceanic organizations, but there's thousands and thousands of many climates and sub-climates.
[00:43:16.018 --> 00:43:23.824]  And so you can always find places in the world that are going to be having record highs or record lows or record rainfall or record high seas.
[00:43:24.745 --> 00:43:29.350]  Especially because now there's more buoys and more satellites and more instruments reading all of this.
[00:43:29.350 --> 00:43:36.057]  And so I want to be careful about saying that, you know, record cold since they've been recording temperatures in Western Europe in the last 350 plus years.
[00:43:38.444 --> 00:43:39.585]  Yeah, there's a very good chance.
[00:44:00.737 --> 00:44:13.828]  Every chance they get, they always want to, you know, tie it into, you know, one of those weird weather anomalies they want to... Well, sure, but I mean, what they've done is they've shifted from global warming to climate change, and then now they've even shifted to our deteriorating climate.
[00:44:13.828 --> 00:44:18.652]  That came out in the New York Times about a year ago, that they have internal talking points from the White House and the U.N.
[00:44:18.652 --> 00:44:21.134]  on this, so they're just teaching people of it's cold.
[00:44:21.374 --> 00:44:22.194]  It's your fault.
[00:44:22.194 --> 00:44:23.515]  If it's hot, it's your fault.
[00:44:23.515 --> 00:44:25.075]  If there's a thunderstorm, it's your fault.
[00:44:25.075 --> 00:44:34.578]  Meanwhile, there's a whole other part of this equation, and that's all the governments and private corporations running around doing weather manipulation that's admitted.
[00:44:34.578 --> 00:44:39.580]  But most of it is classified, but the fact that massive programs are going on, that's declassified.
[00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:43.121]  And so how do we know a lot of this bizarre weather isn't being done intentionally?
[00:44:43.121 --> 00:44:47.583]  Or all the weather modification going on from the Middle East to China to the U.S.
[00:44:48.183 --> 00:44:50.043]  I mean, every major country's doing it.
[00:44:50.043 --> 00:44:54.785]  How do we know that isn't causing chain reactions in climate, which we've had climatologists on to talk about?
[00:44:54.785 --> 00:44:58.846]  You know, I mean, it may not even be intentional.
[00:44:58.846 --> 00:45:12.069]  But what we do know is that human interaction with the environment dealing with climate is very small compared to main drivers like the sun, other types of particles coming in from deep space.
[00:45:12.069 --> 00:45:16.710]  That, they know now for at least 20 years, is what's forming the nuclei in the atmosphere.
[00:45:17.210 --> 00:45:19.612]  So it's the weather in space that's the main driver.
[00:45:19.612 --> 00:45:30.379]  Then, secondarily, there's the moon, which is controlling 76% of the Earth's surface, manipulating the tides, which has a massive atmospheric effect.
[00:45:30.379 --> 00:45:40.907]  And they debate whether it's the second biggest effect or the third, because then there's the internal Earth's magnetic field coming out of the poles that's also causing serious atmospheric anomalies.
[00:45:40.907 --> 00:45:45.210]  And that's why we have the Northern Lights, the Aurora Borealis.
[00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:46.130]  But very good points.
[00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:46.691]  Anything else, John?
[00:45:47.423 --> 00:45:52.125]  Yeah, real quick, I just wanted to request that maybe you can get some guests on your show.
[00:45:52.125 --> 00:46:01.851]  There was Naomi Wolf was one that I've listened to over the years, and she had some good key points, and I thought maybe you could try to get her on as a guest.
[00:46:01.851 --> 00:46:04.292]  You know, we've had Naomi Wolf on a few times.
[00:46:04.292 --> 00:46:07.774]  She is a big liberal, but she is against the police state and has spoken out against Obama.
[00:46:07.774 --> 00:46:11.696]  And the last two times we've tried to get her on, she had phone problems each time and had to get off.
[00:46:12.576 --> 00:46:16.578]  So, what can you do if the phones don't work?
[00:46:16.578 --> 00:46:18.639]  But I appreciate your call, John.
[00:46:18.639 --> 00:46:21.300]  Lonnie, in California, you're on the air.
[00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:23.380]  Go ahead.
[00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:24.181]  Alex.
[00:46:24.181 --> 00:46:25.541]  Hey, buddy.
[00:46:25.541 --> 00:46:26.162]  Hey, how's it going?
[00:46:26.162 --> 00:46:26.642]  How are you doing?
[00:46:26.642 --> 00:46:28.362]  Good.
[00:46:28.362 --> 00:46:40.968]  Oh, I just had a couple of, well actually just mainly if you've really noticed the predictive programming that's been going on lately.
[00:46:42.458 --> 00:46:51.526]  Mainly, uh, going on, like, talking about, like, the Illuminati and stuff, like, uh, basically, uh, what was it?
[00:46:51.526 --> 00:46:55.389]  There's, uh, like, a comic book, uh, like, have you heard of the Avengers?
[00:46:56.243 --> 00:47:08.110]  No, I really don't read a lot of comic books, but I am aware that on TV and movies, in Marvel Comics, it's just everywhere, the Illuminati, the New World Order, is the hottest issue out there for many years now.
[00:47:08.110 --> 00:47:12.593]  People are waking up to the secret ruling class, the social engineers, the priest class.
[00:47:12.593 --> 00:47:23.259]  So the establishment is producing all of these movies and programs, trying to spin it, or saying that, oh, the Statue of Liberty is Lucifer, but it's the good Lucifer.
[00:47:23.259 --> 00:47:25.020]  You know, we're seeing more and more of this.
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:33.486]  Yeah, they tried to just say none of it existed for so long, but now because they can't just deny it, they're basically trying to take it over.
[00:47:33.486 --> 00:47:37.709]  And, you know, if they can't beat us, join us, but then spin it.
[00:47:37.709 --> 00:47:40.371]  But that just shows how effective the alternative media has become.
[00:47:41.553 --> 00:47:42.934]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:47:42.934 --> 00:47:46.595]  That's what I'm totally saying.
[00:47:46.595 --> 00:47:52.277]  I did see the Watchmen that came out a few years ago, and that whole thing's Illuminati.
[00:47:52.277 --> 00:48:02.582]  At the end, and it's true to the comic book, the god-man who's ascended, what's his name, Mr. Manhattan,
[00:48:05.003 --> 00:48:29.705]  He's teamed up with this other guy, Mazzy Damnamus, I forget the name, I've only seen it once, who's the Lucifer type, and he basically uses this energy weapon to destroy a bunch of major cities to bring in world peace and to reduce world population, and Mr. Manhattan at the end says, I do see what you've done now, this is beautiful, killing people en masse, it made perfect sense.
[00:48:30.605 --> 00:48:37.207]  And so basically, any comic book movie I see has those type of parallels in it.
[00:48:37.207 --> 00:48:38.848]  Yeah, no, exactly.
[00:48:38.848 --> 00:48:50.812]  And also, they're making a video game dealing with the Illuminati, the Knights Templar, and this other group I've never heard of personally, but it's called the Dragon.
[00:48:50.812 --> 00:48:57.374]  And basically, the whole point of the game is that it's one of those big, kind of like World of Warcraft,
[00:48:57.833 --> 00:49:13.101]  But basically, the object of the game is that you use these supposed, you know, powers of the Illuminati or the Knights Templar or the Dragon for good, for humanity to help out.
[00:49:13.101 --> 00:49:18.764]  Well, this is what these mystery schools and the Rosicrucians and all branches of this do, and I appreciate your call.
[00:49:20.250 --> 00:49:29.014]  What they do is they bring people in to these different Masonic orders and they say, here is a group of questions about what you would do in moral situations.
[00:49:29.014 --> 00:49:37.197]  And if you answer it in a moral way, and you don't believe the end justifies the means, and you're against enslavement and tyranny, they go, you're like the founding fathers.
[00:49:37.197 --> 00:49:38.098]  You're the good guy.
[00:49:38.698 --> 00:49:39.078]  You know,
[00:49:55.569 --> 00:49:56.029]  I think?
[00:49:56.029 --> 00:49:56.369]  I think?
[00:50:11.041 --> 00:50:14.242]  I first heard Limbaugh about 18 years ago cover this.
[00:50:14.242 --> 00:50:15.562]  I was in college at the time.
[00:50:15.562 --> 00:50:19.523]  Just got out of high school listening to him, and I heard him talk about, yeah, I got friends in Delta Force.
[00:50:19.523 --> 00:50:31.607]  And what they do when they've already gone through all these courses and proven that they're the toughest out there and the smartest is they're given 10 hours at night after they're totally exhausted to read Machiavelli's The Prince.
[00:50:32.748 --> 00:50:36.491]  And then they're given a questionnaire.
[00:50:36.491 --> 00:50:45.799]  And depending on how they answer that, and how they write an essay on that, that's what's decided about where they'll be put in the organization.
[00:50:45.799 --> 00:50:51.443]  And if you decide the end justifies the means, go ahead and do horrible things for a greater good, you're advanced.
[00:50:51.443 --> 00:50:55.086]  And then later I saw on mainstream news that was actually true.
[00:50:55.086 --> 00:50:56.908]  But that's just an example of what they do.
[00:50:56.908 --> 00:50:58.129]  We'll be right back with more of your calls.
[00:50:58.129 --> 00:50:58.509]  Stay with us.

[00:52:00.099 --> 00:52:02.460]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:09.424]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:52:09.424 --> 00:52:11.985]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:52:11.985 --> 00:52:17.388]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:52:17.388 --> 00:52:20.330]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:52:20.330 --> 00:52:22.411]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:52:22.651 --> 00:52:28.933]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:52:28.933 --> 00:52:32.334]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:52:32.334 --> 00:52:38.156]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:52:38.156 --> 00:52:39.796]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:52:39.796 --> 00:52:41.117]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:52:41.117 --> 00:52:43.798]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:52:43.798 --> 00:52:45.218]  He explains everything you need to know.
[00:52:45.498 --> 00:52:48.039]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:52:48.039 --> 00:52:52.582]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:52:52.582 --> 00:52:55.183]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[00:54:20.103 --> 00:54:24.388]  I'm going to continue with your phone calls into the next hour, then I'm going to get into the economy.
[00:54:25.387 --> 00:54:27.628]  I'm going to get into the State of the Union coming up.
[00:54:27.628 --> 00:54:29.490]  Barry Sitaro, known as Barack Obama.
[00:54:29.490 --> 00:54:35.754]  We're going to get into Mexican police, gunmen open fire at soccer games, seven dead.
[00:54:35.754 --> 00:54:45.360]  Every day I see articles, well it's over 30,000 now, or right at 30,000, people killed in Mexico where they have total gun bans in place.
[00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:48.662]  There's one gun shop in the country for police to buy guns.
[00:54:48.662 --> 00:54:51.584]  Okay, total gun ban and it is abject bedlam.
[00:54:53.905 --> 00:54:54.946]  Later I'm going to get into this.
[00:54:54.946 --> 00:55:00.314]  Authorities fear cops being targeted after at least 11 officers shot in 24 hours.
[00:55:00.314 --> 00:55:07.723]  But going over all these cases, it's drug dealers or it's people angry that family had been sentenced to life in prison.
[00:55:07.723 --> 00:55:08.564]  It's criminals.
[00:55:09.125 --> 00:55:12.470]  That's why we have the guns is to protect ourselves.
[00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:14.172]  We're an armed society.
[00:55:14.172 --> 00:55:15.233]  Nobody's going to change that.
[00:55:15.233 --> 00:55:17.677]  We've always been a violent frontier society.
[00:55:17.677 --> 00:55:26.048]  We need guns and you've seen the statistics that more than 20 times on average guns are used to stop or frustrate crime for every time they're used in a crime.
[00:55:26.829 --> 00:55:30.251]  I mean, look at the places that have total gun bans, like Chicago and New York.
[00:55:30.251 --> 00:55:31.792]  Highest crime rates in the country.
[00:55:31.792 --> 00:55:37.616]  The criminals move there because only the citizens who are law-abiding follow those unconstitutional rules.
[00:55:37.616 --> 00:55:44.440]  But this is terrible that police officers are being killed everywhere, but they're saying, you know, they don't think it's a fluke.
[00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:50.663]  Well, what are you going to do as the Mexican mafia and others start targeting police as they've done?
[00:55:50.663 --> 00:55:56.227]  And some of this does appear to be connected to that, so we're going to be breaking that down, but certainly bad news.
[00:55:58.058 --> 00:56:01.279]  And they're saying they're going to beef security up at police stations.
[00:56:01.279 --> 00:56:04.401]  Look, if somebody's ready to give their life, you can't stop them.
[00:56:04.401 --> 00:56:14.265]  They can take all of the guns in America, and I could, with a shank, take all the guns I ever wanted.
[00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:19.403]  I mean, do you know what a ball-peen hammer will do?
[00:56:19.403 --> 00:56:22.026]  I remember reading about World War II.
[00:56:22.026 --> 00:56:23.447]  I'm already getting into this, I guess.
[00:56:23.447 --> 00:56:36.081]  I remember reading about World War II and how they'd be having warfare in the forest, in and around the Battle of the Bulge, but many other battles, and the U.S.
[00:56:36.081 --> 00:56:38.583]  troops would use ball-peen hammers.
[00:56:39.204 --> 00:56:51.514]  Because when you snuck up on a machine gun emplacement, if you gunned them all down, you know, the old special forces move is with the knife, grab around the face, around the mouth so they can't yell, stab them in the kidneys.
[00:56:51.514 --> 00:56:54.216]  That tends to make people go into shock immediately.
[00:56:54.216 --> 00:56:56.198]  That's not what the troops would do most of the time.
[00:56:56.198 --> 00:57:07.267]  They would use a ball-peen hammer in those special forces, airborne-type crews, and they would just slam it down full power on somebody's head, usually killing them, but definitely knocking them out.
[00:57:09.178 --> 00:57:13.466]  I mean, if they took all the guns, what are you going to do about a ball-peen hammer?
[00:57:13.466 --> 00:57:19.237]  You could take all the guns, all the tanks, all the weapons you ever wanted with a ball-peen hammer.
[00:57:19.237 --> 00:57:19.578]  Period.
[00:57:20.779 --> 00:57:21.219]  Period.
[00:57:21.219 --> 00:57:27.621]  A big, heavy ball-peen hammer is the equivalent of what knights would use in warfare of a trudgeon.
[00:57:27.621 --> 00:57:31.202]  Maybe we should search engine a trudgeon or a mace.
[00:57:31.202 --> 00:57:36.083]  A mace, of course, is a trudgeon on the end of a chain that you would swing around for effect.
[00:57:36.083 --> 00:57:42.744]  But a trudgeon, and the 21st century version of that is a heavy ball-peen hammer.
[00:57:42.744 --> 00:57:44.625]  So I don't want violence against government.
[00:57:45.245 --> 00:57:49.429]  But we have a drug-dealing, corrupt society because of the drug war.
[00:57:49.429 --> 00:57:52.891]  I saw statistics just a few days ago out of several European countries.
[00:57:52.891 --> 00:57:55.554]  In fact, will you reprint that for me if you get a chance?
[00:57:55.554 --> 00:57:56.775]  Because I forget the exact nations.
[00:57:56.775 --> 00:58:04.481]  It showed massive... In fact, one headline was, country closing nine prisons because of lack of crime after decriminalizing drugs.
[00:58:04.481 --> 00:58:07.664]  I mean, you got people hopped up out of their minds.
[00:58:07.664 --> 00:58:10.086]  It gives the criminal element something to make money out of.
[00:58:10.086 --> 00:58:11.087]  It corrupts the police.
[00:58:12.088 --> 00:58:14.489]  And most of this stuff in Mexico and here in the U.S.
[00:58:14.489 --> 00:58:15.590]  is drug-related.
[00:58:15.590 --> 00:58:18.492]  Take the money out of it!
[00:58:18.492 --> 00:58:23.935]  How many interviews have you seen where drug dealers admit they don't want drugs decriminalized?
[00:58:23.935 --> 00:58:27.497]  The government's making money off of it as well.
[00:58:27.497 --> 00:58:35.021]  So, you can never take all the guns and stop either criminals or the citizens from doing whatever they want, okay?
[00:58:35.021 --> 00:58:35.962]  That's the way it is.
[00:58:35.962 --> 00:58:38.944]  The only thing you can do is have guns to protect yourself from criminals.
[00:58:38.944 --> 00:58:39.404]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:45.033 --> 00:58:51.300]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

[01:00:27.449 --> 01:00:34.780]  Alright, coming up later, I'm going to talk about this rash of police being killed across the country and what's really behind it.
[01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:41.049]  A huge raft of riots going on all over the Middle East and Northern Africa, from Egypt to Yemen.
[01:00:42.261 --> 01:00:44.483]  That's over into the Middle East itself.
[01:00:44.483 --> 01:00:45.624]  That's all coming up.
[01:00:45.624 --> 01:00:47.385]  Obviously, Ventura lawsuit.
[01:00:47.385 --> 01:00:50.347]  TSA pat-downs classified as unlawful sexual abuse.
[01:00:50.347 --> 01:00:52.749]  And we're going to be covering that.
[01:00:52.749 --> 01:00:58.034]  Our story, Ventura strikes back with lawsuit against TSA, is the top story on Drudge right now.
[01:00:58.034 --> 01:01:00.075]  Tip of the hat to DrudgeReport.com.
[01:01:00.075 --> 01:01:01.897]  But let's continue with your phone calls.
[01:01:01.897 --> 01:01:03.518]  And I'll also get into the State of the Union.
[01:01:03.518 --> 01:01:05.319]  We've got two guests coming up.
[01:01:05.319 --> 01:01:07.041]  Richard in Quebec, you're on the air.
[01:01:08.999 --> 01:01:11.800]  Oh, hi Alex.
[01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:13.441]  It's an honor.
[01:01:13.441 --> 01:01:13.941]  Are you there?
[01:01:13.941 --> 01:01:14.782]  Yes, sir.
[01:01:14.782 --> 01:01:22.265]  Okay, so I used to work in drug intervention in the city of downtown Montreal in 1990, 91, 92.
[01:01:22.265 --> 01:01:33.050]  And I became, actually the stepfather, my stepfather was the godfather of Montreal.
[01:01:33.050 --> 01:01:35.432]  So her daughter was my bride-to-be.
[01:01:35.432 --> 01:01:38.313]  It's Gino Vendetti, it's Andrea Vendetti.
[01:01:38.726 --> 01:01:43.649]  Those two people are not known at all from people, from usual people.
[01:01:43.649 --> 01:01:44.590]  That's the way it works.
[01:01:44.590 --> 01:01:52.694]  The Illuminati always have their best, their best, let's say, players always hidden.
[01:01:52.694 --> 01:01:55.516]  And imagine, you know, like Gino Venditti, the
[01:01:58.362 --> 01:02:04.527]  The godfather of Montreal and nobody in Quebec but really the inner circle knows that.
[01:02:04.527 --> 01:02:11.413]  It's unbelievable how much... Yeah, real money and power spends all its time trying to stay hidden.
[01:02:11.413 --> 01:02:12.874]  Yeah.
[01:02:12.874 --> 01:02:13.535]  That's it.
[01:02:13.535 --> 01:02:16.477]  And what I wanted to say, okay, first there's one thing.
[01:02:16.477 --> 01:02:21.081]  In the street, the Omerta, the secrecy law doesn't concern me in Quebec, okay?
[01:02:21.081 --> 01:02:23.984]  That's because people know me, people respect me.
[01:02:24.497 --> 01:02:34.662]  So, what I say, if ever I get to be killed, it won't be by the street, let's say, okay?
[01:02:34.662 --> 01:02:45.268]  So, what I knew also was that one of the Elves Angels, because actually there were Elves Angels, one of the Elves Angels, one of the 6th Ed of the Elves Angels in 1991 was Bush Sr.
[01:02:48.886 --> 01:02:54.990]  And at that time... Alright, well Richard, you're going to have to send me an article on this or something if you want to go over it.
[01:02:54.990 --> 01:02:57.792]  I appreciate your call.
[01:02:57.792 --> 01:03:01.594]  I've actually... I'm not going to get into it.
[01:03:01.594 --> 01:03:04.316]  Let's go ahead and take a call here.
[01:03:04.316 --> 01:03:07.638]  Let's go ahead and talk to Derek in Minnesota.
[01:03:07.638 --> 01:03:08.818]  Derek, you're on the air.
[01:03:08.818 --> 01:03:10.680]  Thanks for calling.
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:11.720]  Hey, no problem, Alex.
[01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:12.361]  What's going on?
[01:03:12.361 --> 01:03:14.282]  I thought you were talking to GSP for a second.
[01:03:18.201 --> 01:03:20.682]  George St-Pierre is a French-Canadian MMA fighter.
[01:03:20.682 --> 01:03:27.145]  I thought you might know if you pay attention to mixed martial arts.
[01:03:27.145 --> 01:03:32.647]  You had Charlotte Isserbeid on sometime recently.
[01:03:32.647 --> 01:03:34.528]  She wanted to go over the CNP issue.
[01:03:34.528 --> 01:03:35.288]  During that interview,
[01:03:37.799 --> 01:03:44.245]  You actually claim that Joel Skelton agreed with her position on the CNP, and that's completely incorrect, actually.
[01:03:44.245 --> 01:03:52.132]  Joel Skelton, uh, you had on previously, and Joel said that, uh, the group was ineffectual and did nothing but collect fees.
[01:03:52.757 --> 01:04:00.523]  And Izerbek said that they were nothing but dirty and that they're the top of the Republican Party, the dirtiest of the dirty players in the world.
[01:04:00.523 --> 01:04:05.447]  Sure, but I mean, Derrick, you know, like you imply, she wanted to talk about it.
[01:04:05.447 --> 01:04:16.396]  I had her on specifically for a second interview because at the end of a show, when she was bringing it up and the show ended, so I had her back up for more than 30 minutes to get into it, then it went off into Ronald Reagan.
[01:04:16.396 --> 01:04:20.219]  And I'm going from memory about what Skousen said.
[01:04:20.219 --> 01:04:20.960]  He was talking about
[01:04:22.133 --> 01:04:23.495]  Conservative groups in Washington.
[01:04:23.495 --> 01:04:27.541]  I thought he'd said the CMP, but we'll have him back up and bring that up to him.
[01:04:27.541 --> 01:04:30.145]  You know, I do three, four hours of radio every day.
[01:04:30.145 --> 01:04:33.831]  So it's, it's, it's, I mean, I'm, I had her on to cover the subject.
[01:04:33.831 --> 01:04:34.893]  I mean, is there something wrong with that?
[01:04:36.221 --> 01:04:37.002]  No, not at all.
[01:04:37.002 --> 01:04:38.603]  I think it's about time you talked about it.
[01:04:38.603 --> 01:04:41.205]  I mean, you've been covering it up for, like, how many years now?
[01:04:41.205 --> 01:04:47.910]  People have tried to bring it up to you, and you've claimed that it was a CFR-funded left-wing conspiracy theory, and it was a big distraction.
[01:04:47.910 --> 01:04:55.437]  Well, sir, I'm above left-wing and right-wing, and I do think the Council on Foreign Relations is more powerful than that conservative spinoff group.
[01:04:55.437 --> 01:04:59.019]  But, I mean, people invent things to make controversies as drama queens.
[01:04:59.019 --> 01:05:00.421]  People are so jealous of this show.
[01:05:01.161 --> 01:05:05.703]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:05.703 --> 01:05:06.603]  Number 1.
[01:05:06.603 --> 01:05:10.045]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:10.045 --> 01:05:10.905]  Number 2.
[01:05:10.905 --> 01:05:15.787]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:15.787 --> 01:05:16.528]  It's true.
[01:05:16.528 --> 01:05:21.410]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:21.410 --> 01:05:22.230]  Number 3.
[01:05:22.230 --> 01:05:25.811]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:25.811 --> 01:05:29.513]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:29.713 --> 01:05:30.514]  Number 4.
[01:05:30.514 --> 01:05:33.277]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:33.277 --> 01:05:36.962]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:36.962 --> 01:05:37.743]  Number 5.
[01:05:37.743 --> 01:05:41.908]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:05:41.908 --> 01:05:46.674]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:05:46.934 --> 01:05:51.117]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:51.117 --> 01:05:52.899]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:52.899 --> 01:05:55.161]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[01:06:02.245 --> 01:06:06.269]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:06:06.269 --> 01:06:09.492]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:06:09.492 --> 01:06:14.316]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:06:14.316 --> 01:06:20.702]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:06:20.702 --> 01:06:22.944]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:06:23.464 --> 01:06:25.085]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:06:25.085 --> 01:06:26.225]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:06:26.225 --> 01:06:28.486]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:06:42.372 --> 01:06:49.655]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:06:49.655 --> 01:06:58.759]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:07:02.674 --> 01:07:06.635]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:07:06.635 --> 01:07:15.496]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:07:15.496 --> 01:07:20.137]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:07:20.137 --> 01:07:30.939]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:07:31.579 --> 01:07:41.101]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:07:41.101 --> 01:07:46.523]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:07:46.523 --> 01:07:54.004]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:07:54.004 --> 01:07:56.425]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:08:01.772 --> 01:08:04.533]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:04.533 --> 01:08:12.798]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:12.798 --> 01:08:24.483]  Brad Meltzer, the best-selling author and the producer of the hit TV show, Decoded, is scheduled to be joining us for 15 minutes at the bottom of the hour.
[01:08:24.483 --> 01:08:26.384]  He's doing a big phone blitz of interviews.
[01:08:29.394 --> 01:08:29.834]  We're good to go.
[01:08:51.351 --> 01:08:52.112]  I don't know.
[01:09:14.537 --> 01:09:16.238]  I wasn't even inside the Bohemian Grove.
[01:09:16.238 --> 01:09:18.559]  I was on the edge of it at the watermark.
[01:09:18.559 --> 01:09:22.720]  But I knew they were still going to try to arrest me, and they were, and trump stuff up.
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:24.361]  So I got out of there.
[01:09:24.361 --> 01:09:25.521]  And I'm just going to leave it at that.
[01:09:25.521 --> 01:09:29.223]  But we'll see how much of it he wants to get into.
[01:09:29.223 --> 01:09:36.065]  But I also want to talk to him about his new book, The Inner Circle, and how he's good buddies with George Herbert Walker Bush.
[01:09:36.065 --> 01:09:39.827]  You know, I sort of dread what's going to come out on the show two nights from now, but I always take the field.
[01:09:40.638 --> 01:09:41.899]  Most of the time I do.
[01:09:41.899 --> 01:09:51.902]  Sometimes I don't do big mainstream interviews anymore, but even though I know a lot of times this stuff could be a setup, I just can't not take the challenge.
[01:09:51.902 --> 01:09:59.225]  I went out to California and it was quite an event, but we'll see what ends up airing Thursday night.
[01:10:00.540 --> 01:10:07.545]  With this coming out, but he didn't announce to the world until about two weeks ago that he's good buddies with George Herbert Walker Bush and that he's part of the inner circle.
[01:10:07.545 --> 01:10:14.750]  And there's a photo of him in USA Today doing this hand sign in front of one of the government buildings that's a temple.
[01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:16.312]  It's got the big pyramid behind him.
[01:10:16.312 --> 01:10:23.437]  I'm gonna ask him about all of that coming up in a friendly way.
[01:10:23.437 --> 01:10:28.461]  Coming up, obviously two big reports out right now.
[01:10:29.505 --> 01:10:33.207]  And that's Ventura strikes back with lawsuit against TSA.
[01:10:33.207 --> 01:10:36.429]  Top story on Drudge, our article from Infowars.com.
[01:10:36.429 --> 01:10:42.173]  And Ventura lawsuit, TSA pat-downs classified as unlawful sexual abuse.
[01:10:42.173 --> 01:10:45.495]  And I will be covering that article that I haven't gotten to later.
[01:10:46.411 --> 01:10:48.552]  But Meltzer's coming up.
[01:10:48.552 --> 01:10:52.573]  And we had a caller earlier wanting me to talk about the CMP.
[01:10:52.573 --> 01:10:53.593]  So you want it, you got it.
[01:10:53.593 --> 01:10:58.295]  I'm gonna bring it up to Phyllis Schlafly when she comes up on the show in the last 30 minutes.
[01:10:58.295 --> 01:10:59.335]  And some other issues.
[01:10:59.335 --> 01:11:03.036]  I tried to get into it last time, but she got on the show 15 minutes late.
[01:11:03.036 --> 01:11:05.377]  And so we only had about 10 minutes with her.
[01:11:05.377 --> 01:11:07.217]  But I'm gonna bring that up.
[01:11:07.217 --> 01:11:09.258]  Because, you know, people say, well, bring this up about Israel.
[01:11:09.258 --> 01:11:09.698]  So I do.
[01:11:09.698 --> 01:11:10.719]  Or bring this up about the Vatican.
[01:11:10.719 --> 01:11:10.979]  So I do.
[01:11:10.979 --> 01:11:11.539]  Or bring this up.
[01:11:11.539 --> 01:11:14.280]  And then it's like, when I do bring it up, see, you're bad!
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:15.100]  And I'm just like, what?
[01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:16.982]  I mean, it's crazy.
[01:11:16.982 --> 01:11:18.783]  And that's what some folks do.
[01:11:18.783 --> 01:11:21.887]  They go, well, Alex Jones is interviewing Jewish people.
[01:11:21.887 --> 01:11:23.308]  He must work for Israel.
[01:11:23.308 --> 01:11:25.951]  Or Alex Jones is interviewing Catholics.
[01:11:25.951 --> 01:11:28.954]  He must work for them, as if Catholics or Jews are bad.
[01:11:28.954 --> 01:11:30.436]  Or as if I'm not allowed to interview people.
[01:11:30.436 --> 01:11:34.160]  Or Alex interviewed somebody that was part of the CFR or the CMP.
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:37.903]  Or Alex Jones had the heir to the Rothschild fortune on.
[01:11:38.484 --> 01:11:39.785]  You bet I did.
[01:11:39.785 --> 01:11:48.049]  And if other talk show hosts and people that are jealous of this show, and the fact that we reach millions of people, would learn journalistic skill, they could do that.
[01:11:48.049 --> 01:11:53.812]  See, four years ago, I saw that David Rothschild, heir to the richest fortune on the planet,
[01:11:55.234 --> 01:12:02.379]  I had a new children's book out about environmentalism and basically hating yourself and turning everything over to the Rothschild Carbon Trading Company.
[01:12:02.379 --> 01:12:13.185]  We called, this is how producers do it for those that don't know, we called the publisher and we said when are they going to do a promotions blitz just like Brad Meltzer's doing right now.
[01:12:13.185 --> 01:12:16.788]  And they said he's doing one on Earth Day and we can give you 10 minutes.
[01:12:17.688 --> 01:12:19.910]  He's doing about 50 interviews that day.
[01:12:19.910 --> 01:12:22.172]  And we said, yes, we want to promote his book.
[01:12:22.172 --> 01:12:23.473]  Yes.
[01:12:23.473 --> 01:12:26.716]  And so they just dial the number, put him on the phone.
[01:12:26.716 --> 01:12:27.777]  He's like, who is this?
[01:12:27.777 --> 01:12:29.658]  Right before we go live, I go, oh, it's Alex Jones.
[01:12:29.658 --> 01:12:31.860]  He goes, wait, Alex Jones, I've heard of you.
[01:12:31.860 --> 01:12:32.841]  And then we go live.
[01:12:32.841 --> 01:12:34.923]  And then I start blasting him on air.
[01:12:34.923 --> 01:12:37.625]  So he stayed on trying to defend himself.
[01:12:37.625 --> 01:12:38.766]  I ripped him to pieces.
[01:12:38.766 --> 01:12:40.267]  I put it in the film Endgame.
[01:12:40.267 --> 01:12:44.151]  And that's proof that I'm a Rothschild agent because I was able to get him on the show.
[01:12:45.763 --> 01:13:02.435]  Or I work for Pat Buchanan because I, in the early 1990s, it was actually in 92, and then again a little bit in 96, George Humphrey, who was waking up to the New World Order, city council member, who'd been a liberal, he was supporting Pat Buchanan because he was anti-NAFTA and GATT.
[01:13:02.435 --> 01:13:07.199]  And then I have Pat Buchanan on, it's like everything Pat Buchanan ever stood for, you stand with him.
[01:13:07.199 --> 01:13:08.160]  It's just mental illness.
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:35.698]  uh... and and it's about making everything about Alex Jones and not about the information i'm covering exposing the TSA takeover exposing the martial law preparations exposing the banking takeover exposing what's happening all over the world exposing the move towards uh... anti-gun that's what this show is about is about issues uh... but uh... just incredible absolutely incredible you didn't hear that last caller it's funny i have
[01:13:37.307 --> 01:13:45.213]  I have Phyllis Schlafly coming on, and I plan to even ask her about that, and that'll just be more proof I'm evil, because I know how to pick a telephone up and get someone on the show.
[01:13:45.213 --> 01:13:46.994]  I mean, this is a real radio show.
[01:13:46.994 --> 01:13:48.875]  We're actually on big affiliates all over the country.
[01:13:48.875 --> 01:13:50.757]  We call and get guests on.
[01:13:50.757 --> 01:13:51.617]  I have a big crew.
[01:13:51.617 --> 01:13:57.762]  I mean, it's just lie upon lie upon lie upon lie.
[01:13:57.762 --> 01:14:04.626]  I mean, I see these endless lies put out by people that Genesis is owned by some Saudi Arabian.
[01:14:05.735 --> 01:14:12.843]  They say Genesis is owned by a porno company because there's a Genesis porno magazine and production house.
[01:14:12.843 --> 01:14:21.813]  People say we're owned by ABC because about all the satellites we've leased that you could call and lease, one of them was ABC for a few years because that's what stations pick us up off of.
[01:14:21.813 --> 01:14:25.658]  This is disinformation and it's put out by people counting
[01:14:26.098 --> 01:14:27.939]  Probably government in most cases.
[01:14:27.939 --> 01:14:29.640]  Counting on people's ignorance.
[01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:33.501]  Manipulating their ignorance to try to distract from what we're doing.
[01:14:33.501 --> 01:14:35.202]  But I should be glad this is going on.
[01:14:35.202 --> 01:14:36.903]  It means we're having a huge effect.
[01:14:36.903 --> 01:14:40.104]  I should be glad that Nightline's demonizing me.
[01:14:40.104 --> 01:14:45.846]  And I should be glad that MSNBC and CNN are demonizing me and saying I'm dangerous and evil.
[01:14:45.846 --> 01:14:47.767]  Because it means we're doing the right thing.
[01:14:47.767 --> 01:14:49.008]  It means we're having an effect.
[01:14:49.008 --> 01:14:52.709]  Now, not to be distracted any further, but that is an important lesson for folks.
[01:14:52.709 --> 01:14:54.090]  I want to get into some news.
[01:14:54.850 --> 01:14:56.551]  Uh, here for folks right now.
[01:14:56.551 --> 01:14:57.812]  First, let's get into State of the Union.
[01:14:57.812 --> 01:15:02.075]  I'll cover this more coming up in the first half of the next hour, but I want to get to it now.
[01:15:02.075 --> 01:15:04.176]  Uh, exclusive!
[01:15:04.176 --> 01:15:08.819]  President Obama to propose budget freeze and earmarks ban tonight.
[01:15:08.819 --> 01:15:11.041]  Uh, yeah, we'll see if they actually implement that.
[01:15:11.041 --> 01:15:13.822]  He's always proposed a lot of things and sung a good song.
[01:15:13.822 --> 01:15:17.485]  Let's see if he actually dances to the tune, if he walks the walk of the talk.
[01:15:17.485 --> 01:15:18.305]  Uh, so we've got that.
[01:15:18.305 --> 01:15:22.168]  Also, Obama's speech will target spending and a divided Congress.
[01:15:22.168 --> 01:15:23.569]  That's CNN, and he's going to
[01:15:24.744 --> 01:15:36.932]  Basically tell everyone that America's problems, same stuff we saw at the Tucson shooting with his staged pep rally there, all of America's problems aren't the banking cartel, aren't the New World Order, it's us!
[01:15:36.932 --> 01:15:40.234]  It's the American people and our rhetoric and that we're angry at each other.
[01:15:40.234 --> 01:15:44.978]  And Lieberman's in the news saying America's being discredited worldwide because of our vitriol.
[01:15:44.978 --> 01:15:45.098]  No.
[01:15:45.718 --> 01:15:55.580]  People worldwide see America standing up against tyranny, and the Patriot Act, and the TSA, and the illegal wars, and the warrantless wiretapping, and say, America may still be good.
[01:15:55.580 --> 01:16:00.822]  People are saying no to this Chinese-style police state.
[01:16:00.822 --> 01:16:08.964]  But again, they try to put it off on us, the people, and make the debate about how we're causing problems, we're causing shootings, we're causing violence.
[01:16:10.182 --> 01:16:12.243]  There's also a story out of Politico.
[01:16:12.243 --> 01:16:15.084]  White House says birthers aren't rational.
[01:16:15.084 --> 01:16:25.648]  And it goes on to say that Gibbs confirmed that they will be bringing up gun control as part of the State of the Union tonight.
[01:16:25.648 --> 01:16:35.132]  So NBC was right last week when they said that that's the word, that victim disarmament and an attack on the Second Amendment, not just an attack on the first, saying sit down, shut up.
[01:16:35.592 --> 01:16:40.654]  They're trying to tell the Congress people to sit together now, to not sit divided in their houses.
[01:16:40.654 --> 01:16:42.314]  The founders said gridlock was good.
[01:16:42.314 --> 01:16:56.299]  They said a separation of powers was good, so you couldn't get a dictator, you couldn't get a Hitler or a Napoleon or something like that because of the separation of powers, that different powerful groups would fight with each other and never be able to consolidate power.
[01:16:56.299 --> 01:16:57.460]  They understood human nature.
[01:16:58.340 --> 01:17:00.702]  So Gibbs is now saying that.
[01:17:00.702 --> 01:17:03.685]  He's also saying birthers aren't rational.
[01:17:03.685 --> 01:17:07.790]  And they've piqued everybody's interest with the governor of Hawaii saying, I'm going to release it.
[01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:11.814]  And then coming out a month later and saying, actually, I can't find it.
[01:17:11.814 --> 01:17:19.842]  Is it true what some have said that they may produce the original birth certificate soon as some type of coup to boost his approval rating?
[01:17:19.842 --> 01:17:21.884]  Will it be real if he releases it?
[01:17:22.992 --> 01:17:33.980]  Also, we now know one of the new spin terms that they're going to be issuing at this State of the Union propaganda piece tonight.
[01:17:33.980 --> 01:17:42.986]  There's a Republican term that's copyrighted websites used by Republicans in Oregon, and it's win the future.
[01:17:42.986 --> 01:17:46.349]  So just another spin on hope and change.
[01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:56.865]  Continuing here, Supreme Court justices could be no-shows for Obama's State of the Union, Fox News, just one day before President Obama's State of the Union.
[01:17:56.865 --> 01:17:58.486]  This came out last night.
[01:17:58.486 --> 01:18:05.851]  It's still not clear whether Chief Justice John Roberts will attend, or like High Court Justice Samuel Alito, skip the event.
[01:18:06.491 --> 01:18:14.796]  And it says that they may do that because of Obama's rebuke of the justices, which was unprecedented at the last State of the Union.
[01:18:14.796 --> 01:18:19.399]  So we've got that report as well there.
[01:18:19.399 --> 01:18:26.744]  Continuing, looking at the violence around the world, most of it drug-related, when you
[01:18:29.281 --> 01:18:35.706]  De-criminalized drugs, it takes almost all the money out of it, and so now there's all these violent wars over the drug money.
[01:18:35.706 --> 01:18:41.870]  Your police don't get corrupted like they got corrupted on record during alcohol prohibition in the ten years of prohibition there.
[01:18:41.870 --> 01:18:45.512]  And here's a headline, drug-friendly Netherlands to close eight prisons.
[01:18:45.512 --> 01:18:47.554]  I said nine earlier, I was going from memory.
[01:18:47.554 --> 01:18:48.635]  Not enough crime.
[01:18:49.704 --> 01:18:53.968]  The crime has dropped so much because of drug decriminalization, they're having to shut prisons.
[01:18:53.968 --> 01:18:55.229]  Meanwhile, the U.S.
[01:18:55.229 --> 01:19:00.633]  is the capital of prisons worldwide, even outstripping authoritarian China.
[01:19:00.633 --> 01:19:01.414]  Here's Fox News.
[01:19:01.414 --> 01:19:05.097]  Authorities fear cops being targeted after at least 11 officers shot dead in 24 hours.
[01:19:06.710 --> 01:19:12.494]  Going over these cases in Michigan and many other places, most of them appear to be crime or drug related.
[01:19:12.494 --> 01:19:18.038]  And so it's basically street thug, mafia type hits, retaliations on police.
[01:19:18.038 --> 01:19:22.242]  The same thing that we see in Mexico going on.
[01:19:22.242 --> 01:19:24.683]  And again, we have a new report out of Mexico from CNN.
[01:19:24.683 --> 01:19:28.626]  Mexican police government opened fire at soccer game, seven dead.
[01:19:28.626 --> 01:19:29.167]  The answer
[01:19:30.410 --> 01:19:30.790]  I think so.
[01:20:01.713 --> 01:20:05.797]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[01:20:05.797 --> 01:20:10.301]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[01:20:10.301 --> 01:20:16.466]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[01:20:16.466 --> 01:20:18.889]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[01:20:18.889 --> 01:20:24.874]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[01:20:24.974 --> 01:20:28.376]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[01:20:28.376 --> 01:20:30.257]  There is no other program of its kind.
[01:20:30.257 --> 01:20:32.438]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[01:20:32.438 --> 01:20:37.320]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.

[01:20:48.408 --> 01:20:49.108]  800-477-9256 or ZeroDebtGuarantee.com.
[01:21:01.755 --> 01:21:02.776]  Gold isn't for you?
[01:21:02.776 --> 01:21:08.300]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[01:21:08.300 --> 01:21:08.840]  I get it.
[01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:18.468]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[01:21:18.468 --> 01:21:19.869]  That's not what's happening.
[01:21:19.869 --> 01:21:28.355]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[01:21:28.355 --> 01:21:31.598]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[01:21:31.718 --> 01:21:36.002]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[01:21:36.002 --> 01:21:37.603]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[01:21:37.603 --> 01:21:41.566]  dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[01:21:41.566 --> 01:21:45.389]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[01:21:45.389 --> 01:21:46.290]  You should, too.
[01:21:46.290 --> 01:21:47.431]  Find out what they know.
[01:21:47.431 --> 01:21:50.754]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[01:21:50.754 --> 01:21:50.814]  800-686-2237.
[01:21:50.814 --> 01:21:51.154]  800-686-2237.
[01:21:51.154 --> 01:21:51.334]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:22:00.928 --> 01:22:03.330]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:22:03.330 --> 01:22:05.631]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:22:05.631 --> 01:22:08.853]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:22:08.853 --> 01:22:13.956]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:22:13.956 --> 01:22:18.139]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:22:18.459 --> 01:22:20.921]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:22:20.921 --> 01:22:23.683]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:22:23.683 --> 01:22:26.606]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:22:26.606 --> 01:22:34.212]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:22:34.540 --> 01:22:39.944]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:22:39.944 --> 01:22:42.786]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:22:42.786 --> 01:22:46.469]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:22:46.469 --> 01:22:47.549]  And I got news for you.
[01:22:47.549 --> 01:22:48.890]  You're everyone else.
[01:22:48.890 --> 01:22:50.392]  Invisible Empire.

[01:23:57.859 --> 01:24:07.422]  No one knows what it's like to be the bad man.
[01:24:09.093 --> 01:24:36.267]  to be the sad man behind blue eyes no one knows what it's like to be hated to be faded to telling only lies we are back live ladies and gentlemen but my dreams they aren't as empty
[01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:56.557]  As my conscience seems to be I have hours only lonely My love is vengeance
[01:24:59.397 --> 01:25:01.198]  It's hard to turn that off, isn't it?
[01:25:01.198 --> 01:25:03.239]  The one, the only, the who.
[01:25:03.239 --> 01:25:05.280]  Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.
[01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:07.460]  Won't get fooled again.
[01:25:07.460 --> 01:25:20.225]  Coming up later in the next hour, I'm going to get into the economy and Ventura lawsuit.
[01:25:20.225 --> 01:25:20.506]  T.S.
[01:25:20.506 --> 01:25:20.706]  St.
[01:25:20.706 --> 01:25:23.267]  Patdown's classified as unlawful sexual abuse.
[01:25:24.207 --> 01:25:30.171]  Coming out and calling a spade a spade, calling a duck a duck, calling this sexual abuse what it is.
[01:25:30.171 --> 01:25:34.613]  And I've even heard the state police in Texas, to give them some kudos, that I rarely do.
[01:25:34.613 --> 01:25:39.916]  I heard the head of the state police just a few months ago go on and testify that, you know, this is wrong.
[01:25:39.916 --> 01:25:45.659]  A sworn police officer, unless it's an emergency, can't stick their hands down your pants, can't grope you.
[01:25:45.659 --> 01:25:47.761]  This is illegal and it's wrong.
[01:25:47.761 --> 01:25:49.422]  Well, that's exactly what Ventura's saying.
[01:25:49.422 --> 01:25:51.043]  So we're going to be breaking that down.
[01:25:52.123 --> 01:26:00.109]  Uh, but, uh, continuing, uh, here, ladies and gentlemen, we need more prominent people to be heard, to speak up, to stand up.
[01:26:00.109 --> 01:26:04.552]  You know, I routinely get calls from, you know, top musicians in the world.
[01:26:04.552 --> 01:26:09.116]  I routinely get calls from Hollywood people, and nine times out of ten, they don't want to go on air.
[01:26:09.116 --> 01:26:18.082]  They just want to say, we appreciate your work, we're supporting you, but they're not going that extra mile of, of, of, of, of lending their celebrity to the issue to give it attention.
[01:26:18.082 --> 01:26:19.063]  Ventura is doing that.
[01:26:19.443 --> 01:26:23.170]  But he's doing it because his rights are being violated and he will not fly through this.
[01:26:23.170 --> 01:26:29.722]  But I recently got an amazing call that I'm not going to talk about until I have more discussions with him from some household name.
[01:26:31.906 --> 01:26:33.367]  We'll see if we're able to get them on the show.
[01:26:53.377 --> 01:27:02.967]  On his websites are Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and our auxiliary, the Propaganda Matrix, Paul Watson's backup site.
[01:27:02.967 --> 01:27:07.992]  But it's just, I know so many names, so many people, and it's not like, oh look, I know a bunch of famous people.
[01:27:07.992 --> 01:27:11.396]  It's, wow, that's just another cross-reference of society.
[01:27:11.396 --> 01:27:13.237]  How many people are awake?
[01:27:13.237 --> 01:27:16.441]  But it doesn't get any bigger.
[01:27:18.578 --> 01:27:20.399]  Doesn't get any bigger.
[01:27:20.399 --> 01:27:23.281]  And I just constantly have to deal with this.
[01:27:23.281 --> 01:27:26.243]  Just huge people.
[01:27:26.243 --> 01:27:29.404]  But, again, I don't know if they want to go on the show yet.
[01:27:30.529 --> 01:27:32.290]  Move slow on that.
[01:27:32.290 --> 01:27:38.513]  And I know they're probably listening right now, so I want to say hi and appreciate the great music you're sending us and can't wait to hear it.
[01:27:38.513 --> 01:27:43.015]  I can't believe there's going to be a shout out in the new album to this show.
[01:27:43.015 --> 01:27:45.157]  It's just absolutely incredible.
[01:27:45.157 --> 01:27:46.577]  People won't believe it.
[01:27:46.577 --> 01:27:50.059]  I guess you've seen all the folks we've had on, you know, Willie Nelson.
[01:27:50.059 --> 01:27:51.380]  I mean, the list goes on and on.
[01:27:51.380 --> 01:27:55.242]  A great people that recognize tyranny.
[01:27:55.242 --> 01:27:59.364]  And I mean, this is as big as Willie Nelson and in pop culture, really bigger.
[01:28:02.159 --> 01:28:03.160]  Alright, I'm not going to give it away anymore.
[01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:04.661]  I'm not going to give it away anymore.
[01:28:04.661 --> 01:28:07.282]  I'm going to leave it right there.
[01:28:07.282 --> 01:28:09.404]  But it shows how many people are awake.
[01:28:09.404 --> 01:28:11.025]  It's so exciting.
[01:28:11.025 --> 01:28:13.206]  Okay, here's some of the other news.
[01:28:13.206 --> 01:28:17.209]  Renewed push to give Obama an internet kill switch.
[01:28:17.209 --> 01:28:19.170]  And this is out of...
[01:28:20.345 --> 01:28:21.405]  CBS News.
[01:28:21.405 --> 01:28:23.446]  I mean, there they are, just a kill switch.
[01:28:23.446 --> 01:28:32.510]  And Lieberman is pushing for open restrictions on free speech, open restrictions on the internet, giving the government total surveillance power and the power to shut off anything they don't want.
[01:28:32.510 --> 01:28:41.153]  And we're still investigating it last night, but it looks like we may have had someone hack in, yet again, to InfoWars.com
[01:28:42.679 --> 01:28:42.739]  I'm
[01:29:00.834 --> 01:29:01.154]  I don't know.
[01:29:25.812 --> 01:29:29.553]  Uh, on New Year's evening, buying some fireworks to go out in the county and shoot them off.
[01:29:29.553 --> 01:29:38.296]  And a father, well, this little boy ran up and had like stars in his eyes, but in a loving way, you know, loving liberty and said, thank you for what you're doing, Alex.
[01:29:38.296 --> 01:29:48.479]  And I shook the dad's hand and I got in my car and started crying a little bit just because it's just such a responsibility to be able to reach out to so many people, whether they're movie stars or just folks in the street.
[01:29:48.479 --> 01:29:49.779]  I just love you all.
[01:29:49.779 --> 01:29:51.760]  I love that you love liberty.
[01:29:51.760 --> 01:29:53.160]  We're on the march.
[01:29:53.160 --> 01:29:54.661]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.680 --> 01:30:01.363]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.363 --> 01:30:09.467]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:30:09.467 --> 01:30:12.009]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:30:12.009 --> 01:30:17.391]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:30:17.391 --> 01:30:20.433]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:30:20.433 --> 01:30:22.494]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:30:22.734 --> 01:30:28.999]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:30:28.999 --> 01:30:32.381]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:30:32.381 --> 01:30:38.165]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:30:38.165 --> 01:30:39.806]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:30:39.806 --> 01:30:41.107]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:30:41.107 --> 01:30:43.609]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:30:43.769 --> 01:30:47.990]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:30:47.990 --> 01:30:52.612]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:30:52.612 --> 01:30:55.193]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[01:30:55.193 --> 01:30:59.054]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:30:59.054 --> 01:31:00.035]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:31:01.375 --> 01:31:04.958]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[01:31:04.958 --> 01:31:06.259]  It ended on June of 2009.
[01:31:06.259 --> 01:31:10.662]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[01:31:10.662 --> 01:31:16.606]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[01:31:16.606 --> 01:31:18.748]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[01:31:18.748 --> 01:31:21.430]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[01:31:21.770 --> 01:31:28.273]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[01:31:28.273 --> 01:31:30.474]  They both make fabulous investments.
[01:31:30.474 --> 01:31:35.816]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[01:31:35.816 --> 01:31:41.098]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[01:31:41.098 --> 01:31:46.481]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[01:31:46.481 --> 01:31:49.422]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[01:31:49.662 --> 01:31:52.664]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[01:31:52.664 --> 01:31:53.425]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[01:32:00.660 --> 01:32:05.223]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:32:05.223 --> 01:32:06.123]  Number 1.
[01:32:06.123 --> 01:32:09.546]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:09.546 --> 01:32:10.406]  Number 2.
[01:32:10.406 --> 01:32:15.309]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:15.309 --> 01:32:16.050]  It's true.
[01:32:16.050 --> 01:32:20.913]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:20.913 --> 01:32:21.753]  Number 3.
[01:32:21.753 --> 01:32:25.336]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:25.336 --> 01:32:29.038]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:29.238 --> 01:32:30.038]  Number 4.
[01:32:30.038 --> 01:32:32.779]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:32.779 --> 01:32:36.480]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:37.260]  Number 5.
[01:32:37.260 --> 01:32:41.401]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:32:41.401 --> 01:32:46.463]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:32:46.463 --> 01:32:50.624]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:50.624 --> 01:32:52.425]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:52.425 --> 01:32:57.026]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[01:32:57.346 --> 01:32:58.127]  No one's gonna take me
[01:33:13.752 --> 01:33:37.030]  We are live, and Brad Meltzer, best-selling author of a long string of books, his newest one is The Inner Circle, and bradmeltzer.com is the website, and they've got their Secret Societies episode set to air on Thursday night on the History Channel, and I don't know how much of this we can get into, but I was bringing these points up
[01:33:37.811 --> 01:33:40.195]  Chewing during the break when we just got him on a few minutes ago.
[01:33:40.195 --> 01:33:41.937]  We got a lot to talk about.
[01:33:41.937 --> 01:33:43.800]  But Brad, tell us about the show.
[01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:48.608]  Tell us about why you guys contacted yours truly to be part of your Secret Society episode.
[01:33:49.318 --> 01:34:04.007]  Yeah, listen, at the end of the day, we were going to do this episode we wanted to do on The Ultimate Secret Society, you know, better to me than Skull & Bones, better to me than Freemasonry, better to me than, you know, because it exists today, and that is to look up Bohemian Grove.
[01:34:04.007 --> 01:34:13.653]  And our job on Decoded every week, you know, History Channel came to me and said, give us your 10 best mysteries, conspiracies, and we'll give you a team to look at them and try to figure them out.
[01:34:14.333 --> 01:34:17.876]  And that's what we do every week, Thursday night, as you know, at 10 o'clock and 9 central.
[01:34:17.876 --> 01:34:22.860]  And when we started looking at this, and we said, okay, what's the best modern secret society?
[01:34:22.860 --> 01:34:24.642]  And it really is Bohemian Grove.
[01:34:24.642 --> 01:34:27.084]  And as we looked around to say, okay, who's the expert on this place?
[01:34:27.084 --> 01:34:28.585]  Who knows?
[01:34:28.585 --> 01:34:30.427]  And who's been inside?
[01:34:30.427 --> 01:34:34.030]  Yours truly, you know, yourself was the name that kept coming up and up and up.
[01:34:34.030 --> 01:34:36.292]  And my buddy Noah is actually one of your biggest fans.
[01:34:36.292 --> 01:34:38.854]  He lives in Austin, and he loves you.
[01:34:38.854 --> 01:34:40.115]  And he basically was like,
[01:34:40.655 --> 01:34:41.636]  You know, you got to talk to Alex.
[01:34:41.636 --> 01:34:46.600]  Everyone knew it was a list of one, and you were the guy who got inside and took the footage.
[01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:56.809]  So, you know, for the people who are listening, you're going to see not only the voice of Alex, you're going to see him running around with our team, who goes out there in the field and tries to get back into Bohemian Grove.
[01:34:56.809 --> 01:35:01.153]  And it is, I think you know Alex, was one of the, had to be at least one of the best adventures you had this year.
[01:35:01.860 --> 01:35:10.043]  Now you're not, you told me during the break, you're not sure yet what the final cut is even going to be because that's how it works with a production crew.
[01:35:10.043 --> 01:35:16.645]  How much can we talk about with what happened there and History Channel not wanting folks to see my footage inside?
[01:35:17.772 --> 01:35:18.613]  You know what happened?
[01:35:18.613 --> 01:35:27.777]  They actually would love for everyone to see it, and they actually put the whole episode together and cut it together with your footage in there.
[01:35:27.777 --> 01:35:29.338]  You see everything that happens with you.
[01:35:29.338 --> 01:35:29.658]  You see it.
[01:35:29.658 --> 01:35:30.859]  You know, you guys try to get in.
[01:35:30.859 --> 01:35:35.781]  I don't want to ruin the episode, but I will tell you, you'll see some of the team going to jail.
[01:35:35.781 --> 01:35:39.103]  I'll leave it at that, and we'll let people see how it happens.
[01:35:39.103 --> 01:35:43.665]  But what happened was, I actually recorded the full version with the footage,
[01:35:44.345 --> 01:35:46.906]  And history wants it to go because it's the best footage.
[01:35:46.906 --> 01:35:47.706]  Let's be honest, right?
[01:35:47.706 --> 01:35:48.626]  It's incredible.
[01:35:48.626 --> 01:36:02.951]  The problem is, is that the footage was, and I know you know this as well, but the footage, because of California's hidden camera laws, there are legal issues about airing what they consider still to be obtained with a hidden camera.
[01:36:02.951 --> 01:36:04.091]  But this is 10 years old.
[01:36:04.091 --> 01:36:06.552]  I don't think that law is retroactive.
[01:36:08.350 --> 01:36:17.124]  I couldn't tell you, you know, I actually don't know the law about it, but I know that was a little bit... Also, this was an event with hundreds of world leaders setting policy secretly.
[01:36:17.124 --> 01:36:21.771]  They admit that in the Lakeside Chats, so I think the lawyers are wrong, but I know they're erring on the side of caution.
[01:36:22.293 --> 01:36:26.034]  The good news is, I actually, there's no hiding what happened.
[01:36:26.034 --> 01:36:43.900]  I actually, to make sure, I was so determined to make sure that the footage be seen, that what I do, and I know this is in the show, is no matter what, if the footage isn't in there, is I actually physically described everything that's in the footage you gave us, so there's no hiding, you know, what happened or what the, you know, the owl or what he says.
[01:36:43.900 --> 01:36:46.160]  I'm told they did incredible storyboards.
[01:36:48.502 --> 01:36:49.383]  Oh, is that what they did?
[01:36:49.383 --> 01:36:50.685]  They actually did a storyboard?
[01:36:50.685 --> 01:36:51.866]  That's what I was told, yeah.
[01:36:51.866 --> 01:36:52.326]  Oh, good.
[01:36:52.326 --> 01:37:05.842]  I hope so, because what they did is they were like, I knew that they delayed the episode from running because they were fighting to make sure the footage gets in there, and I kept saying, listen, if you don't have the footage, you lose the best part of the show, because when people see it, it blows your mind, right?
[01:37:05.842 --> 01:37:07.684]  It's like, you go, what is that?
[01:37:08.324 --> 01:37:15.407]  And, um, that was my favorite part of watching that footage, because you're like, oh my gosh, is that Walter Cronkite's voice coming out of a giant owl?
[01:37:15.407 --> 01:37:22.049]  And I said to them, can you guys do, whether it's animation or some other way around it, so if they did storyboard, that would be even better.
[01:37:22.049 --> 01:37:27.031]  I actually will tell you, I 100% recorded in case everything went to pot.
[01:37:27.031 --> 01:37:30.132]  I physically described it on air so that we didn't lose that.
[01:37:31.833 --> 01:37:36.157]  The people going to jail, so there's all that new incredible stuff.
[01:37:36.157 --> 01:37:37.999]  Oh yeah, there's no hiding it.
[01:37:37.999 --> 01:37:46.087]  That's the best part of the episode, and this I have seen, I've seen the footage, is when you guys try and get inside, and what happens as a result.
[01:37:46.087 --> 01:37:52.813]  And it is on camera, and you see everyone, and the good part is you even see the Bohemian Grove guy who tries to first turn you away.
[01:37:52.813 --> 01:37:56.637]  I guess he signed, he amazingly signed the release.
[01:37:57.327 --> 01:38:02.829]  So that when he sees you the second time, even though you know he doesn't want to be on camera at that moment, he's on camera.
[01:38:02.829 --> 01:38:19.534]  Well, to be clear, the day before I got there, or the day I got there, they went to the front gate, he came up, they videotaped him, he's the head of security, he signed the release, and the next day, we go up from the river, and then that was a whole other issue, but that's coming up Thursday evening.
[01:38:20.274 --> 01:38:23.117]  Yeah, it's good stuff, man.
[01:38:23.117 --> 01:38:28.081]  I think people are going to go like, wow, that's spectacular.
[01:38:28.081 --> 01:38:30.643]  It's right there, right at the front gate, right on the river.
[01:38:30.643 --> 01:38:31.464]  You see everything.
[01:38:31.464 --> 01:38:33.185]  You see him coming out of jail.
[01:38:33.185 --> 01:38:35.987]  It's amazing footage.
[01:38:35.987 --> 01:38:38.830]  It's amazing that they caught it all on tape.
[01:38:38.830 --> 01:38:39.591]  Absolutely.
[01:38:39.591 --> 01:38:42.453]  Now, I haven't seen the footage.
[01:38:42.453 --> 01:38:44.615]  Is my escape jumping in the river on there?
[01:38:46.621 --> 01:38:48.262]  I saw your escape.
[01:38:48.262 --> 01:38:50.222]  Your escape is awesome.
[01:38:50.222 --> 01:38:53.943]  You move fast for a man of such young age.
[01:38:53.943 --> 01:38:56.784]  I was impressed.
[01:38:56.784 --> 01:38:58.404]  It was pretty impressive.
[01:38:58.404 --> 01:39:04.685]  The funniest part of the whole thing is you know that if they want to get anyone right there, you're the one they want to nab.
[01:39:04.685 --> 01:39:10.407]  You're the guy who gets away, which is just, again, incredible to see it all play out.
[01:39:10.407 --> 01:39:11.747]  But I saw everything.
[01:39:11.747 --> 01:39:14.088]  In the clip that I saw, you see everything.
[01:39:14.088 --> 01:39:15.288]  And I think the only question was,
[01:39:15.908 --> 01:39:22.572]  You know, once the laws get broken, how much of it you can show, but you see everything leading up to it.
[01:39:22.572 --> 01:39:24.614]  I saw the footage of you actually getting away.
[01:39:24.614 --> 01:39:37.342]  I actually don't know... Well, I must have looked like a total clown, though, because the canoe company made me wear the, quote, waterproof baggy clothes, and then they weren't waterproof.
[01:39:37.342 --> 01:39:43.666]  All the water went down, and so it was all hanging, like five, six pounds of water off of me, and I'm just hightailing it.
[01:39:44.326 --> 01:39:52.313]  We've only got about eight minutes left with you, and Brad, promise me that sometime in the near future I can have you for a full 30 minutes or so so we have more time.
[01:39:52.313 --> 01:39:57.677]  Listen, we should talk about it because it's fun, and I want to hear what you think of the episode, so we should definitely talk again.
[01:39:57.677 --> 01:39:58.198]  Absolutely.
[01:39:58.198 --> 01:40:09.087]  Now listen, I told folks that I went out to California, and I said it was Bohemian Grove, but I said I'm not getting into anything that happened, and I said they seem like good folks, and it seems like it's going to be fair.
[01:40:11.288 --> 01:40:24.353]  You're in USA today and we'll put the photo up on screen saying I'm part of the secret circle or I mean I'm part of the inner circle and you're doing this masonic hand sign in front of a temple, a masonic temple, which is the National Archives.
[01:40:24.353 --> 01:40:31.716]  You've got the big pyramid behind you and then I'm like whoa what have I gotten myself into so I'd like you to respond to that.
[01:40:32.576 --> 01:40:38.921]  Yeah, no, the best part of that, I mean, A, it was great because my wife said, you were making a Freemason pose, and I'm like, I was?
[01:40:38.921 --> 01:40:39.682]  Where?
[01:40:39.682 --> 01:40:41.744]  And she goes, on USA Today, dummy.
[01:40:41.744 --> 01:40:43.305]  I mean, that is just news to me.
[01:40:43.305 --> 01:40:46.227]  Anyone who knows me knows I'm not a Freemason.
[01:40:46.227 --> 01:40:52.292]  You know, we take our cameras and went, you know, right into Freemason headquarters and we filmed everything there.
[01:40:52.292 --> 01:40:54.834]  We have no problem showing, asking the hard questions.
[01:40:55.434 --> 01:41:00.118]  Uh, I had no idea, uh, if I were a freemason, I guess I would know what I was doing, but I had no idea.
[01:41:00.118 --> 01:41:03.501]  They just basically said, make a couple poses, you know, try and look calm.
[01:41:03.501 --> 01:41:07.844]  They wanted me to sit down with my legs crossed, and so, they wanted me to pose in front of the National Archives.
[01:41:07.844 --> 01:41:13.989]  My novel's about the National Archives, so, of course, that's where I was standing, but I love the fact that people think that I'm somehow sending secret messages.
[01:41:13.989 --> 01:41:16.811]  That's, that's, that's... Well, perhaps... I guess that should be my new goal in life.
[01:41:16.811 --> 01:41:23.116]  Yeah, perhaps, USA Today, one of their people was an alumnist, and they were asking you to do those poses, you're saying?
[01:41:23.456 --> 01:41:26.337]  You know, the camera guy just said, just do something different.
[01:41:26.337 --> 01:41:27.898]  And I was like, okay, I'll put my hands together.
[01:41:27.898 --> 01:41:31.019]  You know, there's one where I'm sitting down, I'm holding my knees.
[01:41:31.019 --> 01:41:33.440]  The truth was is they didn't like the picture.
[01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:36.341]  I mean, you know, if there is a great conspiracy, these guys are good.
[01:41:36.341 --> 01:41:38.982]  Well, let's expand on that.
[01:41:38.982 --> 01:41:43.444]  Then I learned that you've done NPR interviews and others saying that
[01:41:44.204 --> 01:41:58.537]  George Herbert Walker Bush was basically the incentive, or was involved somehow, influencing your new book, The Inner Circle, and that he's written you little letters and things.
[01:41:58.537 --> 01:42:07.606]  I mean, this is the Grand Poobah, one of the Grand Poobahs of Bohemian Grove, and reportedly has been involved in some of the rituals before.
[01:42:07.606 --> 01:42:09.828]  How did you get to know George Herbert Walker Bush?
[01:42:10.540 --> 01:42:18.787]  You know, I got a letter a couple years ago that said he read my novel, The Millionaires, and would he mind signing a copy for me?
[01:42:18.787 --> 01:42:19.227]  And you know what?
[01:42:19.227 --> 01:42:21.529]  You're the President of the United States.
[01:42:21.529 --> 01:42:22.550]  I'll send you a free book.
[01:42:22.550 --> 01:42:23.591]  I'll send you a coloring book.
[01:42:23.591 --> 01:42:25.252]  I'll send you any kind of book you want, you know?
[01:42:25.252 --> 01:42:30.436]  And I was, you know, just being truthful, I never hide my sources, you know?
[01:42:30.436 --> 01:42:34.740]  I got a letter from Clinton a couple years back also saying that he liked one of the novels, and when you write novels,
[01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:36.502]  And you write thrillers.
[01:42:36.502 --> 01:42:39.046]  I don't care whatever anyone thinks of them.
[01:42:39.046 --> 01:42:43.232]  When the President of the United States says they like your book, that's a cool day.
[01:42:43.232 --> 01:42:43.853]  That's a good day to work.
[01:42:43.853 --> 01:42:50.022]  Well, that's like Ronald Reagan endorsing Tom Clancy and he came from nowhere to being a guy that's made hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:42:50.509 --> 01:42:53.731]  Yeah, I mean, but you know, but does that mean George Bush influences, you know?
[01:42:53.731 --> 01:42:56.553]  I mean, you know, let's be clear.
[01:42:56.553 --> 01:42:58.615]  You know, what happened was, I was writing a book.
[01:42:58.615 --> 01:43:01.157]  I got a call from the Department of Homeland Security a couple years ago.
[01:43:01.157 --> 01:43:04.919]  And they asked me to come in and brainstorm different ways that terrorists could attack us.
[01:43:04.919 --> 01:43:08.782]  And what happened was, I guess they had seen in my novels I do this, you know, I reveal a lot of stuff.
[01:43:08.782 --> 01:43:11.264]  I show where the secret tunnels are below the White House.
[01:43:11.264 --> 01:43:12.465]  I like to go after the truth.
[01:43:12.465 --> 01:43:15.667]  I like to find things that are hidden and show them to the public.
[01:43:16.067 --> 01:43:16.247]  Cyphers!
[01:43:42.596 --> 01:43:44.543]  Yeah, it was Cyphers, exactly.
[01:43:44.543 --> 01:43:48.397]  But he also wrote letters about the Illuminati trying to take over masonry.
[01:43:49.039 --> 01:43:54.063]  Yeah, he did write about the Illuminati in some of his old letters, and he did, um, and he actually was a Mason, to be clear.
[01:43:54.063 --> 01:44:05.973]  I mean, he was a Freemason, and, but what was amazing to me is, in this particular case, rather than asking Freemasons, he said, give me regular, ordinary citizens, because to my aspiring, that's who no one will look at, no one will notice them.
[01:44:05.973 --> 01:44:08.595]  You know, when you get the military guys, people look for them.
[01:44:08.595 --> 01:44:14.100]  And I was so taken by that, I said to, uh, George Bush, and I said to my guy in Homeland Security, who I was talking to, I said,
[01:44:14.620 --> 01:44:19.828]  For my new novel, wouldn't it be cool if you found out that George Washington's spy ring still existed to this very day?
[01:44:19.828 --> 01:44:21.991]  And he said to me, what makes you think it doesn't?
[01:44:21.991 --> 01:44:23.634]  I said, what are you talking about?
[01:44:23.634 --> 01:44:24.355]  He said, think about it.
[01:44:24.355 --> 01:44:26.318]  He said, you know, it's George Washington's spy ring.
[01:44:27.139 --> 01:44:31.020]  It was one of the great success stories of the Revolutionary War.
[01:44:31.020 --> 01:44:38.261]  Hey, we know Nixon had spy rings, so you're telling me that you've had presidents tell you, hey, wink, wink, they're still spy rings.
[01:44:38.261 --> 01:44:40.262]  I mean, I'm not trying to give you the third degree.
[01:44:40.262 --> 01:44:46.083]  No, it wasn't Bush, it was actually a guy, you know, a guy said to me, you know, saying, wink, wink, no, I do not want to be a cool pop for the book.
[01:44:46.083 --> 01:44:53.124]  But here's the thing, I actually went to former President Bush and I said, you know, is it true, you know, could you have, I said to him, flat out, sir, I said,
[01:44:54.644 --> 01:44:57.245]  From my novel, I'm researching George Washington's firing.
[01:44:57.245 --> 01:44:58.286]  Could it still exist today?
[01:44:58.286 --> 01:45:04.748]  And I said to him, you know, in the messages, whenever a president leaves office, they leave a secret note for the president who follows him.
[01:45:04.748 --> 01:45:10.329]  So Reagan left one for Bush, Bush left one for Clinton, you know, on and on.
[01:45:10.329 --> 01:45:14.110]  So I said to him, could you send the secret messages in those notes?
[01:45:14.110 --> 01:45:18.872]  And I get an email back that comes from Bush and it says, the president wants you to see this.
[01:45:19.833 --> 01:45:20.813]  I don't know what's attached to it.
[01:45:20.813 --> 01:45:26.356]  I open up the document, and attached to the document, Bush has sent me the secret letter that he wrote to Bill Clinton.
[01:45:26.356 --> 01:45:28.757]  And Alex, my first thought is, oh my gosh, he sent me a secret code.
[01:45:28.757 --> 01:45:29.978]  There's a cipher.
[01:45:29.978 --> 01:45:32.299]  So I start checking to see whether there's Freemason code in it.
[01:45:32.299 --> 01:45:35.320]  I start checking to see whether there's Thomas Jefferson's old code in it.
[01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:38.281]  I check to see if every third letter of every word spells out, I hate you Bill.
[01:45:38.281 --> 01:45:40.082]  I'm like, what's the story here?
[01:45:40.082 --> 01:45:43.203]  And the truth was, it was actually, I've still tried to crack the thing.
[01:45:43.203 --> 01:45:46.725]  If any of you are readers, I'll be happy to send you the letter if you want to try and crack it.
[01:45:47.225 --> 01:45:49.246]  But there's no code in it, as far as I can find.
[01:45:49.246 --> 01:45:52.766]  It was really just this generous letter saying, you know, I wish you the best of luck.
[01:45:52.766 --> 01:45:53.207]  I'm rooting for you.
[01:45:53.207 --> 01:45:56.987]  Sure, but I mean, obviously, you're charmed or you've hit the zeitgeist.
[01:45:56.987 --> 01:46:01.469]  You've got all these presidents writing you, you know, influencing your book.
[01:46:01.469 --> 01:46:04.729]  Bush Sr., Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove.
[01:46:04.729 --> 01:46:06.750]  And then, you know, in the headline in USA Today,
[01:46:07.250 --> 01:46:11.672]  Brad Meltzer is part of the inner circle.
[01:46:11.672 --> 01:46:17.154]  Man, I tell you, I can't wait to have you back up for a longer interview.
[01:46:17.154 --> 01:46:23.356]  You were telling me off air that you think I come off looking pretty good, but you haven't seen the final cut.
[01:46:23.356 --> 01:46:27.218]  I'm just certainly holding my breath here a little bit.
[01:46:27.218 --> 01:46:30.579]  What time does it air coming up Thursday evening Eastern Time on History?
[01:46:31.059 --> 01:46:33.382]  It's 10 o'clock Eastern Time, 9 o'clock Central Time.
[01:46:33.382 --> 01:46:35.305]  But, you know, here's the thing, Alex.
[01:46:35.305 --> 01:46:41.132]  If I were, you know, if the one guy on the Internet who says, man, Brad Meltzer's in with George Bush.
[01:46:41.132 --> 01:46:45.638]  If I were in with George Bush, why would I be doing an episode on Bohemian Grove and having you come on?
[01:46:45.638 --> 01:46:47.400]  I was about to say, he may not like that.
[01:46:48.261 --> 01:46:51.102]  That'll be the last thing I should write, isn't that the last thing I should ever do?
[01:46:51.102 --> 01:46:54.944]  You watch, I can tell you one thing, watch my remarks at the end of this episode.
[01:46:54.944 --> 01:46:58.045]  And it's not, it ain't a love letter to Bohemian Grove.
[01:46:58.045 --> 01:47:16.293]  You're gonna see, I mean, I can tell you right now what I said at the end of it, because I'll tell you, I mean, I'm not ashamed to say this, I think, you know, on the episode, you'll see that the three people who are in the episode, they're kind of like, you know what, I understand Bohemian Grove a little better now, maybe we were a little hard on them, but I actually come out on the end of the episode and I say flat out, right to the audience, I say, listen,
[01:47:16.813 --> 01:47:17.794]  Here's the thing I don't like.
[01:47:17.794 --> 01:47:28.981]  I'm going to disagree with my team here, and for one moment say that, you know, what I don't like about Bolivian Grove is simply the idea that some people get more shade than other people, and that's not the American system to me.
[01:47:28.981 --> 01:47:29.542]  Sure.
[01:47:29.542 --> 01:47:41.770]  And you know, that's just not, like, I like the idea, you know, our democracy is built by being transparent and being things can be seen, not in any other way, and that smell, I'm not saying it's definitely happening, but that smell,
[01:47:42.390 --> 01:47:45.091]  But you feel like some people are getting more stay than others?
[01:47:45.091 --> 01:47:47.332]  It rubs me the wrong way.
[01:47:47.332 --> 01:47:49.132]  It's the secret room.
[01:47:49.132 --> 01:47:51.934]  And listen, I don't mind being criticized or there being debate.
[01:47:51.934 --> 01:47:53.954]  I think that makes a good informative show.
[01:47:53.954 --> 01:47:54.875]  So I got thick skin.
[01:47:54.875 --> 01:47:56.035]  I'm a tough guy.
[01:47:56.035 --> 01:48:02.337]  I'm just seeing, you know, all these major power brokers that you're involved with that are then involved in Bohemian Grove.
[01:48:02.337 --> 01:48:03.258]  We're going to find out.
[01:48:03.258 --> 01:48:03.798]  And you know what?
[01:48:03.798 --> 01:48:04.818]  I believe your perspective.
[01:48:04.818 --> 01:48:07.479]  I believe that you believe this is fair and riveting.
[01:48:07.479 --> 01:48:09.080]  And I'm honored to be part of the show.
[01:48:09.080 --> 01:48:09.680]  We'll find out.
[01:48:10.140 --> 01:48:13.542]  Exactly what happens Thursday, because even you haven't seen the exact final cut.
[01:48:13.542 --> 01:48:15.664]  I know networks tweak things at the very end.
[01:48:15.664 --> 01:48:18.285]  It's bradmelzer.com.
[01:48:18.285 --> 01:48:21.727]  The Inner Circle is his latest thriller, already a bestseller.
[01:48:21.727 --> 01:48:23.749]  We'll link this interview up at infowars.com.
[01:48:23.749 --> 01:48:33.315]  And Brad, after I've seen the episode, please come on with us in the next few weeks so we can hash it over, but also talk about some of the other episodes.
[01:48:33.315 --> 01:48:34.355]  But thanks for including me.
[01:48:34.355 --> 01:48:35.976]  Yeah, no, seriously, tell your guy.
[01:48:35.976 --> 01:48:37.237]  I mean, he has my contact info.
[01:48:37.237 --> 01:48:38.018]  I've been straight up with him.
[01:48:39.133 --> 01:48:41.715]  Set a time, man, because I think you're going to be really pleased.
[01:48:41.715 --> 01:48:46.819]  OK, well, we'll Friday call your people and try to set something up next week, Brad.
[01:48:46.819 --> 01:48:48.180]  Brad, thank you so much.
[01:48:48.180 --> 01:48:49.901]  Thank you so much for the time.
[01:48:49.901 --> 01:48:51.282]  I'll speak to you soon, brother.
[01:48:51.282 --> 01:48:55.065]  All right, there goes Brad Meltzer.
[01:48:55.065 --> 01:48:57.647]  I mean, again, the crew all seemed nice.
[01:48:57.647 --> 01:49:03.471]  He seemed nice, but there was a few little creepy things going on, obviously, and we'll see what happens.
[01:49:03.471 --> 01:49:05.733]  But you can see he's a slick, well-spoken guy.
[01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:10.662]  I don't really watch any television as folks.
[01:49:10.662 --> 01:49:14.785]  No, I watch kind of boil downs on YouTube or on the web or what my crew brings me.
[01:49:14.785 --> 01:49:18.949]  I watch movies on my DVD player and that's about it.
[01:49:18.949 --> 01:49:21.511]  When I jog or when I watch a late night movie with my wife.
[01:49:21.511 --> 01:49:29.457]  But I haven't seen all these promos airing but I was on a radio interview earlier today and they were bringing up, hey we see all over TV with this History Channel promo.
[01:49:29.457 --> 01:49:32.120]  So maybe we should go to the decoded
[01:49:32.840 --> 01:49:33.140]  I don't
[01:49:57.159 --> 01:49:57.399]  I think so.
[01:50:15.603 --> 01:50:16.444]  I'd tentatively agree.
[01:50:16.444 --> 01:50:18.545]  We were looking at that date, and I said, boom, that's it.
[01:50:18.545 --> 01:50:19.986]  I will travel for that.
[01:50:19.986 --> 01:50:23.329]  I love doing multiple things, you know, on the same trip.
[01:50:23.329 --> 01:50:26.511]  And it was a circus.
[01:50:26.511 --> 01:50:28.293]  And I was not going to jail.
[01:50:28.293 --> 01:50:36.959]  I had to get back down the coast 100 miles or 90 miles to Santa Cruz to speak to two sold-out houses of 800 people per night.
[01:50:38.320 --> 01:50:45.167]  And they ended up cramming another hundred in, so it was really about 900 each night, or 1,800 in the two speeches I gave Saturday and Sunday evening.
[01:50:45.167 --> 01:50:46.669]  And so, boom!
[01:50:46.669 --> 01:50:48.330]  I got out of there.
[01:50:48.330 --> 01:50:51.053]  But they did not get out of there, and they went to jail.
[01:50:51.053 --> 01:50:54.176]  But I didn't trespass, I only went up to the water line.
[01:50:54.176 --> 01:51:00.243]  Alright, we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with a bunch of other news, your calls, and we've got another guest coming up.
[01:51:01.769 --> 01:51:03.070]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:03.070 --> 01:51:08.654]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:08.654 --> 01:51:13.678]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:13.678 --> 01:51:19.262]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:19.262 --> 01:51:21.083]  So our friends at Solutions from Science
[01:51:21.343 --> 01:51:21.843]  We're good to go!
[01:51:49.366 --> 01:51:50.807]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:50.807 --> 01:51:58.433]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:58.433 --> 01:52:01.716]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:52:01.716 --> 01:52:04.998]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:52:04.998 --> 01:52:11.903]  Did you know that Republicans and Democrats alike are now fighting the erection of a fence along the Mexican border?
[01:52:11.903 --> 01:52:18.749]  So they can prepare for the North American Union to merge Canada, Mexico, and the United States into one economic bloc.
[01:52:19.841 --> 01:52:27.124]  Just like the European Union, we'll lose our national sovereignty, our Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:52:27.124 --> 01:52:35.567]  These ultra-rich men rule the world in secret right now, but will openly rule it very soon.
[01:52:35.567 --> 01:52:38.448]  Is this what Americans want?
[01:52:38.448 --> 01:52:40.589]  Then we need to repent before our God.
[01:52:41.573 --> 01:52:49.742]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:53:04.094 --> 01:53:13.083]  One World Whey is the first cold-temperature-processed, 100% all-natural, unrefined, bioactive, grass-pasture-raised, milk-whey protein.
[01:53:13.083 --> 01:53:25.795]  Far from being another ordinary protein supplement, One World Whey is a full-spectrum nutrition power food in and of itself, providing overall life-building benefits that touch virtually every human's life, that other protein supplements don't deliver on.
[01:53:26.235 --> 01:53:27.415]  What are the benefits?
[01:53:27.415 --> 01:53:40.439]  Boosts the immune system, anti-aging properties, helps detoxification, helps reduce body fat, excellent for building lean muscle, increases energy levels, enhances the feelings of youth, sports performance, exercise recovery.
[01:53:40.439 --> 01:53:41.379]  Who's it for?

[01:54:19.614 --> 01:54:30.842]  Okay, for one segment in the next hour, from 8 after to 20 after, we've got Joel Seehusen, President and CEO of Liberty Guard, of course works with Bob Barr.
[01:54:30.842 --> 01:54:33.764]  Bob Barr investigates TSA standout on National Opt Out Day.
[01:54:33.764 --> 01:54:35.705]  This is a guest they just set up because today,
[01:54:37.646 --> 01:54:51.530]  Is the last day for the TSA to respond to the FOIA request that then becomes an order dealing with their spying reportedly on myself, Matt Drudge, and others and the naked body images that they reportedly got.
[01:54:51.530 --> 01:54:56.291]  I want to go to some calls in this segment and the next and I've got other news coming up we do have Phyllis Schlafly on.
[01:54:57.111 --> 01:54:57.291]  I think?
[01:55:15.211 --> 01:55:20.514]  You can even remove fluoride from every water source in your home with a whole house fluoride system.
[01:55:20.514 --> 01:55:25.576]  They have a wide variety of filters to remove all types of toxins from your water, including shower bath filters.
[01:55:25.576 --> 01:55:27.097]  All the filters are made in the USA.
[01:55:27.097 --> 01:55:28.698]  I know that's evil, but they are.
[01:55:28.698 --> 01:55:29.799]  I'm sorry.
[01:55:29.799 --> 01:55:36.342]  Check out their banners on PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com or go to PureWaterFreedom.com and take control of your water supply today.
[01:55:36.342 --> 01:55:41.665]  Also, I want to tell you about Interfood, a wonderful green food, 20 superfoods that are not
[01:55:42.225 --> 01:55:42.766]  I don't know.
[01:55:51.937 --> 01:55:53.719]  And we live in this toxic environment.
[01:55:53.719 --> 01:55:55.000]  It's so important.
[01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:56.901]  And they have, of course, the green food, the inner food.
[01:55:56.901 --> 01:56:01.045]  They've got healthy coffee infused with rainforest polysaccharides.
[01:56:01.045 --> 01:56:02.866]  They've got a whole bunch of great products.
[01:56:02.866 --> 01:56:04.688]  Amazing folks at innerfood.com.
[01:56:04.688 --> 01:56:05.428]  My wife takes it.
[01:56:05.428 --> 01:56:06.329]  Rob Jacobson takes it.
[01:56:06.329 --> 01:56:07.130]  They all love it.
[01:56:07.130 --> 01:56:09.632]  I take it when I remember to and act like a good boy.
[01:56:09.632 --> 01:56:12.634]  Innerfood.com, E-N-E-R, food.com, or 866-762-9238, 866-762-9238, innerfood.com.
[01:56:18.599 --> 01:56:28.562]  Uh, and don't forget this is the last week to get five plus months free at PrisonPlanet.TV and all of your purchases in support of the sponsors and our websites makes what we do here possible.
[01:56:28.562 --> 01:56:32.264]  Uh, Darius in California, you're on the air, welcome.
[01:56:32.264 --> 01:56:34.144]  Yes, thank you for taking my call.
[01:56:34.144 --> 01:56:36.185]  Welcome.
[01:56:36.185 --> 01:56:44.868]  Uh, I just wanted to let you know I saw on C-SPAN, um, there was a gentleman named John Lott who has a book out called More Guns, Less Crime.
[01:56:45.239 --> 01:56:46.079]  Yep, we've interviewed him.
[01:56:46.079 --> 01:56:50.140]  We put a special one-hour video out on presentplanet.tv two weeks ago on it.
[01:56:50.140 --> 01:56:50.900]  Amazing info.
[01:56:50.900 --> 01:56:52.480]  Go ahead.
[01:56:52.480 --> 01:56:53.500]  Yeah, it was great.
[01:56:53.500 --> 01:56:57.561]  And the interesting thing about him is he's just that numbers cruncher.
[01:56:57.561 --> 01:57:01.882]  He's not even really a Second Amendment advocate or anything like that.
[01:57:01.882 --> 01:57:04.782]  Yeah, he's a statistics professor.
[01:57:04.782 --> 01:57:06.283]  Right.
[01:57:06.283 --> 01:57:09.083]  But that's a great, unbiased opinion.
[01:57:14.474 --> 01:57:21.335]  Also, I just wanted to say, 5 Star Soap is a great product and Ron Paul 2012.
[01:57:21.335 --> 01:57:22.015]  Absolutely!
[01:57:22.015 --> 01:57:30.697]  Draft Ron Paul 2012 and that means just getting the hype going at the grassroots so people understand, hey, he was right about the fellow deserved.
[01:57:30.697 --> 01:57:32.437]  He was right about currency devaluation.
[01:57:32.437 --> 01:57:33.558]  Let's get behind him.
[01:57:33.558 --> 01:57:35.018]  Shally in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:57:35.018 --> 01:57:37.458]  Hey Alex.
[01:57:37.458 --> 01:57:37.959]  Hey.
[01:57:37.959 --> 01:57:39.259]  I've talked to you before.
[01:57:41.022 --> 01:57:53.972]  In July or August of 2009, I sent you an email with some information regarding closed military bases and what I thought basically they were going to be doing with them.
[01:57:53.972 --> 01:57:55.333]  And I've been doing a lot more research.
[01:57:55.333 --> 01:57:59.336]  And it's all confirmed in the Emergency Centers Act?
[01:57:59.336 --> 01:58:06.522]  Well, what I find is that every single closed base links to a company called GlobalSecurity.org.
[01:58:08.070 --> 01:58:15.296]  And GlobalSecurity.org, if you type in any closed base, it comes up GlobalSecurity.org.
[01:58:15.296 --> 01:58:21.721]  And basically, they have taken over the bases and everything about them.
[01:58:21.721 --> 01:58:30.909]  And they have webpages of every single closed base, and specifically certain bases that have some kind of significant
[01:58:31.368 --> 01:58:32.810]  Tell you what, stay there.
[01:58:32.810 --> 01:58:33.991]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:33.991 --> 01:58:35.072]  I wanna hear more from you.
[01:58:35.072 --> 01:58:35.692]  You are listening to GCN.

[02:00:11.115 --> 02:00:12.716]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.716 --> 02:00:14.256]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.256 --> 02:00:18.437]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.437 --> 02:00:22.498]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:35.191 --> 02:00:37.432]  Yeah, I've heard of GlobalSecurity.org.
[02:00:37.432 --> 02:00:44.176]  I'm looking at their site, reportedly involved in all sorts of operations around the world and running bases.
[02:00:44.176 --> 02:00:57.504]  But, you know, instead of just speculating, I know under the Base Closure Act, they've taken them, they've set up National Guard or State Guard bases, they've set up Threat Fusion Centers, these command bases in them, with the CIA over it.
[02:00:57.504 --> 02:01:03.348]  And I'm not particularly sure about Global Security, this company, and their involvement in bases.
[02:01:04.537 --> 02:01:12.660]  But I do say on their site that they have Afghanistan facilities and other facilities all over the world.
[02:01:12.660 --> 02:01:16.882]  But I can't specifically speak to that.
[02:01:16.882 --> 02:01:21.944]  It more looks like an index of what's going on with different bases.
[02:01:21.944 --> 02:01:23.965]  But we know under the Emergency Centers Act,
[02:01:24.980 --> 02:01:25.200]  That's
[02:01:42.179 --> 02:01:42.399]  Yes, I do.
[02:01:42.399 --> 02:01:45.341]  Also, we did have that episode, DVR'd, and it did disappear from our
[02:02:09.514 --> 02:02:15.417]  Oh no, I have it internally confirmed from a major cable company where they got the orders to erase it.
[02:02:15.417 --> 02:02:16.897]  I mean, it's on record.
[02:02:16.897 --> 02:02:17.998]  Yeah.
[02:02:17.998 --> 02:02:30.143]  Well, um, specifically of my list that I just, the points I wanted to make is when I went down the list of the specific closed spaces that I have the list, it came up global security for every single one of them.
[02:02:30.143 --> 02:02:35.605]  And like specifically one in Dayton, which is Dayton, Ohio, it's now called Gentile Station.
[02:02:36.445 --> 02:02:38.167]  And so they've renamed it that.
[02:02:38.167 --> 02:02:40.650]  And then the one in Jacksonville, that was at Cecil Field.
[02:02:40.650 --> 02:02:44.234]  When they closed that, now that's called New World Avenue.
[02:02:44.878 --> 02:02:57.241]  Yeah, well, there's no doubt that the government has been training for more than 20 years, asking troops, will you fire on Americans, and having role players scream, I'm an American, not the camp, I'm your dad, I'm your mom, oh, please don't take my guns.
[02:02:57.241 --> 02:03:00.062]  You know, setting up checkpoints and arresting people.
[02:03:00.062 --> 02:03:01.482]  So there's no doubt that's going on.
[02:03:01.482 --> 02:03:06.404]  And there's no doubt they got InfraGard and clergy response teams, and it's all just proven on record.
[02:03:06.404 --> 02:03:07.644]  I appreciate your call, Sally.
[02:03:07.644 --> 02:03:09.025]  Very interesting.
[02:03:09.025 --> 02:03:09.905]  Rich in New York.
[02:03:09.905 --> 02:03:10.525]  Rich, you're on the air.
[02:03:14.093 --> 02:03:15.735]  Hey Rich, how you doing buddy?
[02:03:15.735 --> 02:03:16.876]  Okay, let's move on.
[02:03:16.876 --> 02:03:17.937]  Todd in California.
[02:03:17.937 --> 02:03:18.757]  Todd, you're on the air.
[02:03:18.757 --> 02:03:20.099]  Go ahead.
[02:03:20.099 --> 02:03:22.281]  Yeah, hello Alex.
[02:03:22.281 --> 02:03:23.722]  I want to bring up something.
[02:03:23.722 --> 02:03:34.912]  I don't know if you remember, but last year at either the G20 or G8 meeting where Obama said that he will offer solutions or proposals next year, referring to 2011.
[02:03:34.912 --> 02:03:37.635]  And I want to get your take on that.
[02:03:38.405 --> 02:03:42.966]  I think he's referring to, you know, austerity measures that will be coming... No, no, they've already said that.
[02:03:42.966 --> 02:03:44.586]  They've already told us how cool it is.
[02:03:44.586 --> 02:03:54.828]  They raise the taxes, the majority of the money goes to interest on debt to foreign bankers who created it by fraud, and then cut all the benefits, and then tell you it's your benefits that are the problem.
[02:03:54.828 --> 02:04:03.090]  And certainly, a lot of them are out of control, it's wrong to tax people and give it to other people, but you could get rid of all the benefits, all the entitlements, and there'd be
[02:04:04.531 --> 02:04:04.771]  Exactly.
[02:04:04.771 --> 02:04:08.114]  I also want to touch upon the government takeover of our pensions and IRAs.
[02:04:08.114 --> 02:04:09.456]  How exactly will they do that?
[02:04:09.456 --> 02:04:11.778]  Will they make us liquidate our holdings?
[02:04:11.778 --> 02:04:13.920]  I have a private IRA.
[02:04:27.384 --> 02:04:31.506]  We have to liquidate our holdings and then buy government bonds?
[02:04:44.912 --> 02:04:47.093]  Folks, you've heard us talk about Home Gain before.
[02:04:47.093 --> 02:04:53.616]  Home Gain is now offering a special promo where you get up to $150 when you buy or sell a home with a Home Gain agent you find through their Find a Realtor program.

[02:06:01.443 --> 02:06:05.006]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[02:06:05.006 --> 02:06:06.147]  It ended on June of 2009.
[02:06:06.147 --> 02:06:10.711]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[02:06:10.711 --> 02:06:16.657]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[02:06:16.657 --> 02:06:18.818]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[02:06:18.818 --> 02:06:21.481]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[02:06:21.841 --> 02:06:28.327]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.

[02:06:30.549 --> 02:06:35.873]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[02:06:35.873 --> 02:06:41.178]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.

[02:07:13.549 --> 02:07:19.493]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[02:07:19.493 --> 02:07:23.156]  Not worried about them moving south.
[02:07:23.156 --> 02:07:26.698]  Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[02:07:29.307 --> 02:07:34.793]  I'm looking for America.
[02:07:34.793 --> 02:07:36.435]  Wear American and be proud.
[02:07:36.435 --> 02:07:39.639]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[02:07:39.639 --> 02:07:48.088]  The land I left free and the home of the brave seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[02:07:55.228 --> 02:08:01.616]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[02:08:01.616 --> 02:08:07.023]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:07.023 --> 02:08:09.306]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:13.302 --> 02:08:17.084]  We are live, eight minutes into this third hour.
[02:08:17.084 --> 02:08:23.969]  Phyllis Schlafly, the founder of the Eagle Forum, will be joining us live to talk about this so-called New Republican Revolution.
[02:08:23.969 --> 02:08:28.932]  Will it actually restore liberty in this country?
[02:08:28.932 --> 02:08:35.536]  The top story at DrugsReport.com is our article written by Aaron Dykes and yours truly last night.
[02:08:35.536 --> 02:08:39.058]  Ventura strikes back with lawsuit against TSA.
[02:08:40.580 --> 02:08:41.881]  I guess technically it's today's story.
[02:08:41.881 --> 02:08:43.261]  It went up about 1 a.m.
[02:08:43.261 --> 02:08:44.462]  last night.
[02:08:44.462 --> 02:08:57.209]  It's the inside story from Alex Jones about the former governor's humiliating pat-down experience that included touching, groping, and rubbing of the genitals at the hands of the TSA because I've flown with Ventura, traveled with him, and seen it for myself.
[02:08:57.209 --> 02:09:01.551]  He's now filed the suit he told me about privately in November because he says his career is over.
[02:09:01.551 --> 02:09:02.952]  He's not traveling anymore by plane.
[02:09:03.592 --> 02:09:10.134]  The problem is TSA wants to roll this out and is rolling it out nationwide with the Viper teams and the rest of it.
[02:09:10.134 --> 02:09:16.036]  We are joined right now by Joe Seehusen.
[02:09:16.036 --> 02:09:20.497]  He is the President and CEO of Liberty Guard, the organization founded by Bob Barr.
[02:09:20.497 --> 02:09:25.259]  Of course, the headline from back in December, Bob Barr investigates TSA stand down on National Opt Out Day.
[02:09:25.259 --> 02:09:29.000]  They're also in the FOIA request, which is really an order.
[02:09:30.160 --> 02:09:31.661]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:09:31.661 --> 02:09:32.201]  Great to be here.
[02:09:55.953 --> 02:10:04.259]  Break down what the FOIA is dealing with and what's going to happen if Homeland Security doesn't respond to this.
[02:10:04.259 --> 02:10:19.549]  The big question is, has the TSA, for political reasons, potentially jeopardized the safety of American citizens flying on certainly the largest day of flying, Thanksgiving Day?
[02:10:20.581 --> 02:10:27.336]  Uh, and that's a serious question, uh, that we wanted to find out about, and the genesis of this, of course, is that, uh...
[02:10:29.881 --> 02:10:58.149]  Many, many groups and people saw that these pat-downs, these invasive pat-downs, which took a great deal of time, which were offensive to people, which were very unpleasant and unsavory, they were taking place, they took a great deal of time, and many groups were saying, gee, on a busy day, let's make a point that many Americans don't like this and don't want it.
[02:10:58.849 --> 02:11:15.381]  And as a consequence, you know, we'll go through some of this and we'll bring media attention to this issue of do we want these image scanning machines, which are also invasive, or even worse, these pat-downs, which are offensive.
[02:11:15.381 --> 02:11:28.190]  And it turns out that on this day that Liberty Guard and other groups called for, in a sense, an opt-out, where folks would not go through the scanner but take the pat-down.
[02:11:29.039 --> 02:11:42.345]  It turns out that media reported and many eyewitness accounts from around the country showed that these machines in question and the pat-down procedures were not taking place.
[02:11:42.345 --> 02:11:50.889]  And as a consequence, the natural question arises, since we've been told without these pat-downs and without these scanning machines, we're really not safe.
[02:11:51.559 --> 02:11:57.992]  The traveling public in the United States flying in airplanes would help these pat-down procedures, these scanners.
[02:11:57.992 --> 02:12:00.978]  You know, anything could happen and they must take place.
[02:12:01.707 --> 02:12:09.710]  But because there was going to be national media attention on this day and on this issue, these machines were shut down.
[02:12:09.710 --> 02:12:12.211]  Well, that is what we're concerned may have happened.
[02:12:12.211 --> 02:12:14.172]  They were shut down, in fact.
[02:12:14.172 --> 02:12:16.493]  Our question is, why were they shut down?
[02:12:16.493 --> 02:12:22.895]  And we have filed a Freedom of Information Act, Liberty Guard has filed a Freedom of Information Act, to find that out in fact.
[02:12:22.895 --> 02:12:26.537]  Because if, in fact, the CSA, for its own political gain,
[02:12:29.144 --> 02:12:42.804]  Yeah, this terror threat is so imminent, so deadly, they've got to force people in wheelchairs that can't walk to be forced up, or they've got to stick their hands down our pants to keep us safe from Al-Qaeda.
[02:12:43.365 --> 02:12:48.168]  How could they just, and by the way, we had a crew that flew the day before Thanksgiving.
[02:12:48.168 --> 02:12:50.590]  I had friends and family that flew the day after Thanksgiving.
[02:12:50.590 --> 02:12:56.854]  The stand down was the day before, the day of, and for at least three days after, they were just not using the machines.
[02:12:56.854 --> 02:13:01.237]  And countless media outlets went out and confirmed that day and the day after, they were not being used.
[02:13:01.237 --> 02:13:03.238]  So there's no doubt that that went on.
[02:13:03.238 --> 02:13:05.900]  So, I mean, what are these scanners really all about?
[02:13:05.900 --> 02:13:10.903]  Is it about training us to submit to federal takeovers and to our persons being violated?
[02:13:12.819 --> 02:13:13.819]  Well, absolutely.
[02:13:13.819 --> 02:13:19.362]  You know, a very reasonable person would ask these very reasonable questions.
[02:13:19.362 --> 02:13:23.824]  And the first question is, do any of these procedures, are they truly effective?
[02:13:23.824 --> 02:13:28.226]  And those are real questions that we want hard answers to, and hard numbers to, and we want to know.
[02:13:29.268 --> 02:13:38.519]  And certainly these photographic imaging machines, which essentially are see-through scanners, see-through people's clothing.
[02:13:38.519 --> 02:13:47.809]  And then these pat-downs, which are just breathtaking in their intrusiveness and their degradation of everyday Americans.
[02:13:47.809 --> 02:13:49.591]  And we want to know that.
[02:13:51.465 --> 02:13:59.948]  And again, the TSA went ahead and denied that they were playing politics with passenger security procedures.
[02:13:59.948 --> 02:14:13.714]  In fact, their spokesman, a woman named Tawika O'Reilly, in response to our comments, the Liberty Guard, claimed, quote, that AIT operations were normal throughout the week, including last Wednesday.
[02:14:13.714 --> 02:14:15.354]  And this is the punchline.
[02:14:15.354 --> 02:14:17.075]  Any suggestions to the contrary?
[02:14:30.698 --> 02:14:44.421]  And so now that they're on record saying that they didn't do this and that we're idiots for saying it, if you're able to get the documentation showing that they lied, which we know they are lying clearly, then they're going to have a very serious problem on their hands.
[02:14:45.816 --> 02:14:50.259]  Well, that's exactly it, Alex, and that takes us right to the present moment.
[02:14:50.259 --> 02:14:55.543]  We did file this FOIA request, and as you know, there's a time period in which they have to respond.
[02:14:55.543 --> 02:15:03.009]  As of 5 o'clock Eastern today, they likely will have not responded within another couple hours, I guess.
[02:15:05.272 --> 02:15:23.000]  And then we at Liberty Guard have a choice to make, and certainly want input from all of your listeners, on whether we go ahead and give them an extension, give them more time to comply, or really file a suit in federal court.
[02:15:24.511 --> 02:15:50.676]  You know, frankly, both of those will require funding on our part, and if any of your listeners can do to help us, that's a liberty card, we'd appreciate it, but we're going to move forward because it's too important an issue regardless, and we are prepared to file a suit against the TSA in federal court if they don't comply, because we're not willing to trust them when they say that they will not play politics with the safety of everyday Americans, which they've proven.
[02:15:52.836 --> 02:15:56.337]  Clearly the momentum is completely shifted against TSA.
[02:15:56.337 --> 02:16:00.058]  Congress is talking about investigations.
[02:16:00.058 --> 02:16:10.721]  Airports are moving to kick the government TSA out, but then bring in private security that will basically follow some of the same activities, but hopefully won't be quite as goonish.
[02:16:10.721 --> 02:16:13.682]  We had them just lose last week the suit in Texas.
[02:16:14.761 --> 02:16:25.528]  They settled it where they pulled the woman's shirt off and revealed her breast and then laughed and came up to her when she was crying in the gate reportedly and said, man, I wish I'd have been part of that search.
[02:16:25.528 --> 02:16:31.032]  We now have them losing a court case out on the West Coast, as I'm sure you know, dealing with videotaping.
[02:16:32.088 --> 02:16:32.348]  I don't
[02:16:49.991 --> 02:16:50.692]  Well, I would say this, Alex.
[02:16:50.692 --> 02:16:53.975]  I suspect that the nature of government bureaucracies is that they will go as far as we will let them.
[02:17:15.358 --> 02:17:20.184]  I don't think they're self-policing.
[02:17:20.184 --> 02:17:34.401]  I think their mission is to grow, to get bigger, to get richer by way of more budget to them, to hire more staff, to expand their scope, and I'm sure they can find numerous rationale
[02:17:35.109 --> 02:17:37.811]  To justify any and every behavior.
[02:17:37.811 --> 02:17:46.957]  I think the only way that these federal bureaucracies will know where the line is drawn is where we, the American people, tell them it is.
[02:17:46.957 --> 02:17:55.442]  And I think civil liberties, because they're so, at least historically, so, so ridiculous in this country, we have them and we take them for granted.
[02:17:55.442 --> 02:17:57.884]  They're almost, in a way, nebulous to us.
[02:17:57.884 --> 02:17:59.324]  We're just used to free speech.
[02:17:59.324 --> 02:18:01.546]  We're used to freedom of movement.
[02:18:02.390 --> 02:18:07.652]  Um, that until we see a concrete example, it doesn't wake us up.
[02:18:07.652 --> 02:18:14.315]  And I think when Americans watch the television and they saw elderly people, they saw people with infirmities,
[02:18:15.259 --> 02:18:17.300]  It looks like images of Nazi Germany.
[02:18:17.300 --> 02:18:20.622]  What do you think of Ventura's lawsuit that was filed yesterday?
[02:18:33.888 --> 02:18:46.469]  Well I think Jesse is a tremendous patriot and anytime people stand up and say this is the line, this is where it's going to stop with me, I think it's a good thing and I think that
[02:18:47.623 --> 02:18:48.223]  Exactly!
[02:18:48.223 --> 02:18:50.865]  It's an example for others to resist.
[02:18:50.865 --> 02:18:51.685]  Absolutely.
[02:19:04.992 --> 02:19:06.513]  Yeah, we're almost out of time.
[02:19:06.513 --> 02:19:12.396]  What's your view on DHS now rolling out 9,000 locations with telescreens saying watch your neighbors?
[02:19:12.396 --> 02:19:16.319]  They now have promo videos showing the TSA at sports stadiums.
[02:19:16.319 --> 02:19:18.280]  I mean, they clearly want to be on the streets of America.
[02:19:19.966 --> 02:19:25.653]  Well, again, Alex, and thank you and your listeners for your leadership fighting for America's freedoms.
[02:19:25.653 --> 02:19:34.124]  But I would restate that, again, these groups have no mission other than to get bigger and more powerful and more intrusive.
[02:19:34.124 --> 02:19:35.626]  And they will do so, obviously.
[02:19:35.626 --> 02:19:37.849]  You know, Congress has not done its job.
[02:19:38.490 --> 02:19:38.951]  I think so.
[02:20:01.650 --> 02:20:06.193]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:20:06.193 --> 02:20:07.113]  Number 1.
[02:20:07.113 --> 02:20:10.536]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:20:10.536 --> 02:20:11.396]  Number 2.
[02:20:11.396 --> 02:20:16.279]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:20:16.279 --> 02:20:17.040]  It's true.
[02:20:17.040 --> 02:20:21.903]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:20:21.903 --> 02:20:22.723]  Number 3.
[02:20:22.723 --> 02:20:26.326]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:20:26.326 --> 02:20:30.008]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:20:30.208 --> 02:20:31.009]  Number 4.
[02:20:31.009 --> 02:20:33.771]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:20:33.771 --> 02:20:37.454]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:20:37.454 --> 02:20:38.255]  Number 5.
[02:20:38.255 --> 02:20:42.399]  A solar-powered generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:20:42.399 --> 02:20:47.163]  Folks, I really believe in the solar-powered generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:22:01.377 --> 02:22:03.778]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:22:03.778 --> 02:22:06.079]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:22:06.079 --> 02:22:09.300]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:22:09.300 --> 02:22:14.401]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:22:14.401 --> 02:22:18.603]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:22:18.923 --> 02:22:21.266]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:22:21.266 --> 02:22:24.149]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:22:24.149 --> 02:22:27.072]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:22:27.072 --> 02:22:34.681]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:22:35.003 --> 02:22:40.386]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:22:40.386 --> 02:22:43.248]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:22:43.248 --> 02:22:46.930]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:22:46.930 --> 02:22:48.010]  And I got news for you.
[02:22:48.010 --> 02:22:49.351]  You're everyone else.
[02:22:49.351 --> 02:22:50.832]  Invisible Empire.

[02:23:37.773 --> 02:23:45.478]  Remember, Big Berkey includes free shipping on every order over $50, and GCN listeners get 5% off all ceramic filter systems.

[02:24:09.519 --> 02:24:14.821]  Joe C. Hewson is our guest, President and CEO of LibertyGuard, LibertyGuard.org.
[02:24:14.821 --> 02:24:26.785]  They're eyeing whether to give the TSA and Homeland Security more time to answer their foyer about the stand-down in and around the Thanksgiving holiday, or whether they're going to go ahead and just file a lawsuit.
[02:24:26.785 --> 02:24:30.847]  I personally, and I know Bob Barr's a smart guy and so is Joe, but
[02:24:31.767 --> 02:24:32.087]  I don't know.
[02:24:47.279 --> 02:24:49.220]  Infowars.com.
[02:24:49.220 --> 02:25:04.245]  Showtips at Infowars.com or go to Liberty Guard and send you information confirming the leaks we've already had that this stand down did go on plus the leaks we've had that they're targeting the Drudge Report and Alex Jones and people like that and saying these are extremists.
[02:25:04.245 --> 02:25:06.266]  But continuing, you were getting cut off by the break there.
[02:25:06.266 --> 02:25:13.209]  You were talking about the awakening and people really coming together now that our fundamental rights and even our personal space is being violated.
[02:25:14.560 --> 02:25:15.441]  Well, I think yes.
[02:25:15.441 --> 02:25:33.278]  I think your show and, you know, just chronicling and detailing the agencies, the bureaucracies, the actions, the scope creep, the expansion of government, of bureaucracies, and the steady erosion of our civil liberties.
[02:25:33.278 --> 02:25:39.404]  An everyday citizen might look at one component of that and say, well, that's not that bad, and maybe
[02:25:40.433 --> 02:25:44.535]  Maybe we ought to just trust our politicians and all will be well.
[02:25:44.535 --> 02:25:50.279]  I think if anyone looks at the aggregate scope of what's happening, it's alarming.
[02:25:50.279 --> 02:26:06.728]  And you're chronicling, pointing out, showing the big-picture scope of this erosion of civil liberties, the erosion of our Constitution, and the growth of bureaucrats which are, in many cases, not fully accountable or responsible.
[02:26:07.448 --> 02:26:10.430]  And are playing fast and loose with our freedoms.
[02:26:10.430 --> 02:26:21.054]  And so, I think again, on these various issues, I think all of us need to stop and do a gut check and say there's points at which we're not going to let things erode any further.
[02:26:21.054 --> 02:26:36.401]  And in the case of Liberty Guard, we're saying to the CSA, you need to prove to us, you need to prove to the American people that you did not take a risk on the lives of tens of thousands of Americans for your own political reasons, for your own political fiefdoms.
[02:26:36.941 --> 02:26:42.743]  Prove that to the American people, and if not, we're going to show up shortly in a federal court and demand that you do.
[02:26:42.743 --> 02:26:54.868]  And so, we certainly appreciate the support of your listeners, but we also ask them to support all the wonderful programs and projects where people are standing up and standing tall and saying this is where it's going to end.
[02:26:55.689 --> 02:26:56.290]  Absolutely.
[02:26:56.290 --> 02:27:01.895]  If we don't hang together, we will surely hang separate, as Benjamin Franklin said.
[02:27:01.895 --> 02:27:07.160]  And this is clearly one of the straws that is breaking the camel's back.
[02:27:07.160 --> 02:27:14.387]  Anybody who's flown a lot has seen people in wheelchairs are trying to force up, who look like they're on the edge of death, the yelling at people.
[02:27:15.228 --> 02:27:15.548]  I don't know.
[02:27:36.454 --> 02:27:40.338]  And clearly they know this is about political domination.
[02:27:40.338 --> 02:27:48.404]  What about the 10th Amendment issue of TSA now saying, with the Viper teams, that they are now on the streets of America and are expanding that?
[02:27:48.404 --> 02:27:52.128]  I mean, that right there just shows how much trouble we're in.
[02:27:53.888 --> 02:28:08.711]  Well, and again, thanks to you for, again, looking at all these issues and disseminating the information and letting countless Americans look and see what's happening, because as all of this unfolds, it's unfolding at a breathtaking pace.
[02:28:09.489 --> 02:28:16.115]  And unless we involve ourselves and unless we decide to stand tall, it's going to sweep over us.
[02:28:16.115 --> 02:28:19.257]  Our civil liberties will buckle.
[02:28:19.257 --> 02:28:21.519]  Our Constitution is certainly threatened.
[02:28:21.519 --> 02:28:25.983]  Obviously, we've all talked about the debt and its impact on this country.
[02:28:25.983 --> 02:28:34.791]  But it has to be that the information is out there and that people engage and say that this is where we're going to draw the line.
[02:28:35.211 --> 02:28:47.906]  Well, Joe, anybody who studied history or just common sense, if we'll put up with warrantless searches and hands down our pants, I mean, it's always more, more, more, and radiation bathing scanners, what won't we put up with?
[02:28:47.906 --> 02:28:50.489]  I mean, this is really the make it or break it test.
[02:28:50.990 --> 02:28:55.853]  People going back three, four months ago, before this became the big issue, said, why are you spending so much time on it?
[02:28:55.853 --> 02:28:59.136]  And why were we having contests for people to make videos to expose it?
[02:28:59.136 --> 02:29:07.782]  The point is, we recognize this is a key juncture in our republic's history, right as we're going into this government-orchestrated implosion of the economy.
[02:29:08.602 --> 02:29:15.043]  Right as we're seeing these attacks on liberties, they want to set the precedent for total federalization of our society.
[02:29:15.043 --> 02:29:23.085]  The threat fusion centers, the InfraGard, the clergy response teams, the citizen spies, the telescreens going in Walmart.
[02:29:23.085 --> 02:29:24.645]  I mean, this is right out of 1984.
[02:29:24.645 --> 02:29:26.705]  We've got to recognize it, come together and say no.
[02:29:26.705 --> 02:29:29.906]  And that's why folks really need to support libertyguard.org.
[02:29:29.906 --> 02:29:34.127]  Joe C. Hewson, thank you so much for
[02:29:35.467 --> 02:29:38.270]  Joining us and I look forward to talking to you.
[02:29:38.270 --> 02:29:39.611]  How soon do we got 20 seconds?
[02:29:39.611 --> 02:29:43.635]  How long do we see the decision on Sue or give him more time a few days?
[02:29:43.635 --> 02:29:48.119]  We're on the march the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[02:30:01.564 --> 02:30:06.107]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:30:06.107 --> 02:30:07.028]  Number 1.
[02:30:07.028 --> 02:30:10.450]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:10.450 --> 02:30:11.311]  Number 2.
[02:30:11.311 --> 02:30:16.194]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:30:16.194 --> 02:30:16.954]  It's true.
[02:30:16.954 --> 02:30:21.818]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:30:21.818 --> 02:30:22.638]  Number 3.
[02:30:22.638 --> 02:30:26.240]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:30:26.240 --> 02:30:29.943]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:30.123 --> 02:30:30.924]  Number 4.
[02:30:30.924 --> 02:30:33.687]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:30:33.687 --> 02:30:37.371]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:30:37.371 --> 02:30:38.171]  Number 5.
[02:30:38.171 --> 02:30:42.316]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:30:42.316 --> 02:30:47.081]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:30:47.361 --> 02:30:51.526]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:51.526 --> 02:30:53.328]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:53.328 --> 02:30:55.571]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:30:55.571 --> 02:30:57.914]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:31:02.213 --> 02:31:17.701]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[02:31:17.701 --> 02:31:21.363]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:22.389 --> 02:31:35.143]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:31:35.143 --> 02:31:42.431]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[02:31:43.092 --> 02:31:53.483]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[02:31:53.483 --> 02:31:57.406]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[02:31:57.406 --> 02:32:00.530]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[02:32:01.158 --> 02:32:05.361]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:32:05.361 --> 02:32:11.766]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:32:11.766 --> 02:32:19.152]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:32:19.152 --> 02:32:24.035]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[02:32:24.035 --> 02:32:26.157]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.
[02:32:28.979 --> 02:32:32.688]  Or see them online at FiveStarSoap.com or InfoWars.com.
[02:32:32.688 --> 02:32:36.417]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[02:32:36.949 --> 02:32:43.710]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[02:32:43.710 --> 02:32:47.591]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[02:32:47.591 --> 02:32:53.973]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying a 1-2 month soap sampler.
[02:32:53.973 --> 02:32:55.153]  Thank you.
[02:33:04.713 --> 02:33:11.296]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[02:33:11.296 --> 02:33:22.822]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:22.822 --> 02:33:31.346]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:33.795 --> 02:33:41.523]  Our key story that we were just covering with the head of Liberty Guard, Bob Barb's operation, is up at the Drudge Report top story.
[02:33:41.523 --> 02:33:43.946]  It's also on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:33:43.946 --> 02:33:47.429]  Ventura strikes back with lawsuit against TSA.
[02:33:47.429 --> 02:33:51.253]  Ventura lawsuit, TSA pat-downs classified as unlawful sexual abuse.
[02:33:52.034 --> 02:33:55.897]  We'll continue to cover that, obviously, as the transmission continues.
[02:33:55.897 --> 02:34:05.243]  The next 30 minutes, or 27 minutes to be technical, Phyllis Schlafly joined us a week or so ago, but we can only get about 15 minutes with her, so she's been gracious to come back with us.
[02:34:05.243 --> 02:34:06.704]  Really needs no introduction.
[02:34:06.704 --> 02:34:08.765]  She's the national leader of the conservative movement.
[02:34:08.765 --> 02:34:21.474]  Since the publication of her best-selling 1964, A Choice on an Echo, she has been a leader of the pro-family movement since 72, when she started her national volunteer organization, now called Eagle Forum, who's really done a great job all over the country fighting the NAFTA highways.
[02:34:22.708 --> 02:34:22.868]  Ms.
[02:34:22.868 --> 02:34:27.969]  Schlafly's monthly newsletter, called the Phyllis Schlafly Report, is now in its 43rd year.
[02:34:27.969 --> 02:34:31.030]  Her syndicated column appears in 100 newspapers plus.
[02:34:31.030 --> 02:34:40.212]  Her radio commentaries are heard daily on over 500 radio stations, and her radio talk show on the education called the Eagle Forum Live is heard weekdays on 75 stations.
[02:34:40.212 --> 02:34:42.333]  Eagleforum.org is her website.
[02:34:42.333 --> 02:34:46.013]  We have her information linked up at infowars.com.
[02:34:46.013 --> 02:34:47.714]  And I wanted to get her on about
[02:34:48.334 --> 02:34:50.295]  The so-called conservative movement.
[02:34:50.295 --> 02:34:53.937]  Because, you know, we see Republicans giving us government almost as big as Obama.
[02:34:53.937 --> 02:34:57.900]  You know, Bush doubling government, Obama tripling it the first year.
[02:34:57.900 --> 02:35:04.704]  And we see these articles about Republicans' mainline are going to come in and, you know, teach the Tea Parties how to behave.
[02:35:04.704 --> 02:35:07.225]  And Giuliani's saying they could be a problem.
[02:35:07.225 --> 02:35:08.386]  And so there's this struggle.
[02:35:08.386 --> 02:35:14.430]  You know, can the Republican Party be used to try to restore the Republic?
[02:35:14.430 --> 02:35:16.151]  And we're going to talk to Phyllis Schlafly about that.
[02:35:16.151 --> 02:35:17.232]  Also, we're going to get her view.
[02:35:18.271 --> 02:35:21.952]  on what's happening right now with the big State of the Union coming up tonight.
[02:35:21.952 --> 02:35:31.775]  Gibbs told us yesterday and today there will be gun grabbing pushed on the heels of the drug addict lunatic in Tucson that had nothing to do with conservatives.
[02:35:31.775 --> 02:35:35.176]  They tried to frame people with that.
[02:35:35.176 --> 02:35:40.078]  They will call for everybody to shut up their political rhetoric because we're telling the truth and it's effective in hurting them.
[02:35:40.078 --> 02:35:42.599]  Their climate tax, their carbon taxes, their
[02:35:43.439 --> 02:35:45.341]  Government takeover of health care.
[02:35:45.341 --> 02:35:46.381]  They want us to shut up.
[02:35:46.381 --> 02:35:48.143]  And they're saying speech is bad.
[02:35:48.143 --> 02:35:51.045]  So they're not just attacking the Second Amendment, now it's the First Amendment.
[02:35:51.045 --> 02:35:51.705]  Very brazen.
[02:35:51.705 --> 02:35:55.708]  Calls for the return to the fairness doctrine, restricting free speech on talk radio.
[02:35:55.708 --> 02:35:59.051]  And he's going to claim he's going to try to balance the budget and have earmark freezes.
[02:35:59.051 --> 02:36:00.652]  Now he's suddenly talking like Rand Paul.
[02:36:00.652 --> 02:36:01.973]  We'll see if that's the case.
[02:36:01.973 --> 02:36:04.515]  But I wanted to get Phyllis Schlafly's take on all of this.
[02:36:04.515 --> 02:36:05.516]  Phyllis, thank you for joining us.
[02:36:06.102 --> 02:36:06.923]  Hello, Alex.
[02:36:06.923 --> 02:36:07.903]  Good to join you.
[02:36:07.903 --> 02:36:08.544]  Good to have you.
[02:36:08.544 --> 02:36:11.405]  What do you want to tackle first?
[02:36:11.405 --> 02:36:14.407]  What's going on with the Republicans and where you see it headed?
[02:36:14.407 --> 02:36:16.208]  Or the State of the Union coming up?
[02:36:16.208 --> 02:36:19.170]  Well, I can't predict what Obama's going to say.
[02:36:19.170 --> 02:36:22.111]  I know the media's been trying to predict everything.
[02:36:22.111 --> 02:36:25.994]  But I think he's not moving to the center.
[02:36:25.994 --> 02:36:32.998]  He's just a left-wing socialist like he's always been, and he's trying to soothe people with some good work.
[02:36:32.998 --> 02:36:35.059]  So I don't believe there's any real change there.
[02:36:35.518 --> 02:36:43.284]  In Obama, I think he's a dedicated guy who, just as he told Joe the Plumber, he wants to spread the wealth around.
[02:36:43.284 --> 02:36:48.209]  And that doesn't just mean from people who are taxpayers to non-taxpayers.
[02:36:48.209 --> 02:36:49.430]  It means from the U.S.
[02:36:49.430 --> 02:36:53.093]  to other countries around the world.
[02:36:53.093 --> 02:37:01.539]  However, the conservative movement, I think, demonstrated its force in the November elections.
[02:37:01.539 --> 02:37:03.481]  I believe in the two-party system.
[02:37:03.481 --> 02:37:04.462]  That's what we've got.
[02:37:05.474 --> 02:37:07.916]  I'm not a supporter of any third party.
[02:37:07.916 --> 02:37:26.467]  I think that we're going to have to retake the conservative control of the Republican Party, which we did in 1964, and then we did in 1980, and somehow it slipped away under George W. Bush, but we can get it back, and we welcome the Tea Party people.
[02:37:28.100 --> 02:37:33.284]  Phyllis Lafley, you knew Ronald Reagan well and, of course, Nancy Reagan.
[02:37:33.284 --> 02:37:38.629]  Reagan did some good things on the Second Amendment and cutting taxes.
[02:37:38.629 --> 02:37:44.234]  Are you saying that this modern conservative movement is going to try to imitate Reagan?
[02:37:45.655 --> 02:37:47.296]  The big giant war on drugs.
[02:37:47.296 --> 02:37:48.517]  I agree with Ron Paul on that.
[02:37:48.517 --> 02:37:49.758]  It's been used to take our liberties.
[02:37:49.758 --> 02:37:52.339]  And look what the war on drugs has done in Mexico.
[02:37:52.339 --> 02:37:56.202]  Just like liquor prohibition increased crime and corruption of police.
[02:37:56.202 --> 02:38:02.526]  I don't want to see the mainline kind of Republican move towards invading all these countries that's bankrupting us.
[02:38:02.526 --> 02:38:10.151]  I mean, when you say true conservative movement, how do you define it on like the TSA and the groping or all these wars?
[02:38:10.151 --> 02:38:12.493]  I mean, where do you stand on that as the leader of the Eagle Forum?
[02:38:13.326 --> 02:38:18.668]  Well, I think the biggest war going on at the present time is immediately south of our border.
[02:38:18.668 --> 02:38:22.050]  And we certainly don't want to let it come into this country.
[02:38:22.050 --> 02:38:31.994]  I agree that we ought to have a fence on the border, as Congress has voted, and even Obama signed, or voted for, and George Bush signed.
[02:38:31.994 --> 02:38:38.197]  And I think that that's where more people are being killed than anyplace else.
[02:38:38.197 --> 02:38:42.559]  So we cannot let that drug war come into the United States.
[02:38:43.234 --> 02:38:48.017]  I think the immigration issue is tremendously important.
[02:38:48.017 --> 02:38:54.140]  I think the illegals are coming in and taking jobs from our people who are high school dropouts.
[02:38:54.140 --> 02:38:56.602]  We already have a great supply of high school dropouts.
[02:38:56.602 --> 02:38:59.203]  We don't need a new supply of them.
[02:38:59.203 --> 02:39:01.985]  And so I think that should be a major focus.
[02:39:03.328 --> 02:39:11.210]  Sure, but specifically to my question, because, you know, we saw what Newt Gingrich did, Mr. Carbon Tax, Mr. Globalist with the Republican takeover in 1994.
[02:39:11.210 --> 02:39:21.332]  I'm specifically saying, where do you and the Eagle Forum stand on, you know, we don't just have all of the entitlements that the left likes.
[02:39:21.332 --> 02:39:24.353]  We've got all of these giant military industrial complexes.
[02:39:24.813 --> 02:39:28.035]  Well, I'm certainly not for making drugs legal.
[02:39:28.035 --> 02:39:31.158]  And you know, it was on the ballot in California, the trendsetter of our country.
[02:39:31.158 --> 02:39:37.442]  And I think everybody thought legalization of marijuana was going to take place.
[02:39:37.442 --> 02:39:41.085]  And surprise, surprise, the people voted it down.
[02:39:54.212 --> 02:39:59.437]  Well, I've got to say, I mean, you know, we've got triple the heroin, double the cocaine flowing in we had 20 years ago.
[02:39:59.437 --> 02:40:06.983]  Well, that's because the big majority of it's coming in from Mexico, and I think we should take every step necessary to stop it.
[02:40:06.983 --> 02:40:14.169]  Well, what do you think about the TSA saying that they've got to do all these things to us to keep us safe, but they did just cancel the virtual fence.
[02:40:14.169 --> 02:40:19.094]  As you know, they never built... Well, the virtual fence was always a fraud, I think.
[02:40:19.856 --> 02:40:21.158]  We need a real fence.
[02:40:21.158 --> 02:40:22.340]  A real concrete fence.
[02:40:22.340 --> 02:40:25.586]  Fences work in other countries around the world.
[02:40:25.586 --> 02:40:27.949]  And you need a double fence.
[02:40:29.526 --> 02:40:32.849]  And you need not to let the illegals come in.
[02:40:32.849 --> 02:40:33.929]  Sure.
[02:40:33.929 --> 02:40:41.054]  Shifting gears back over to Obama, he got that 15 point gallop bounce that's short-lived.
[02:40:41.054 --> 02:40:55.885]  It's already dropped down to 12 in just a week after that poll came out from the shooting and he had that political pep rally there in Tucson with the 14,000 t-shirts about Together We Thrive and really tried to capitalize on it and tried to attack the First Amendment.
[02:40:55.885 --> 02:40:57.907]  What's your view on
[02:40:58.707 --> 02:41:00.048]  That whole debacle?
[02:41:00.048 --> 02:41:07.512]  Well, of course, what happened in Arizona was a tragedy, but I think Obama tried to capitalize on it.
[02:41:07.512 --> 02:41:24.262]  You know, Clinton and I think Rahm Emanuel, too, have said that after Clinton was beaten in the Republican off-year election in 1994, he felt that he bounced back because of the Oklahoma City bombing.
[02:41:24.262 --> 02:41:27.764]  Now, I don't understand that, but apparently that's what he believes.
[02:41:28.508 --> 02:41:42.133]  And so that urban legend has percolated through to Obama, and I think he was trying to get himself back from the Arizona killing, which of course he had nothing to do with.
[02:41:42.133 --> 02:41:44.814]  We're glad he expressed his sympathy, but that's enough.
[02:41:44.814 --> 02:41:47.855]  Move on and do what he ought to be doing.
[02:41:47.855 --> 02:41:50.276]  Well, there are calls for the internet kill switch.
[02:41:50.276 --> 02:41:53.697]  That's in CBS News today under federal control.
[02:41:53.697 --> 02:41:57.058]  Cyber security... Well, we certainly don't want CBS running the internet.
[02:41:58.564 --> 02:42:02.186]  Well, of course the effort to talk about reinstating the Fairness Doctrine is an attempt to get Rush Limbaugh off the air.
[02:42:02.186 --> 02:42:02.946]  I know he has a powerful audience.
[02:42:22.552 --> 02:42:39.732]  And when they got rid of the Fairness Doctrine, why then we got Rush, and of course when you have freedom out there, the conservatives can win because we have good arguments and we can make our case, and the liberals can't get any ads to run their show because they're so boring and they don't have any answers.
[02:42:41.547 --> 02:42:43.929]  Well, well said on that front.
[02:42:43.929 --> 02:42:49.392]  Phyllis, you probably don't even remember who I am, but in the last 16 years on air, I've interviewed you every few years.
[02:42:49.392 --> 02:42:51.454]  You've been friendly to come on with us.
[02:42:51.454 --> 02:42:59.179]  I wanted to bring up another issue, because we're talking about who controls these political parties, and we know that Wall Street gave all that money to Obama, but also to McCain.
[02:42:59.179 --> 02:43:07.905]  We know that Wall Street, a lot of it is offshore now, and pushes for having open trade with China, but then they're not fair with us.
[02:43:10.046 --> 02:43:17.061]  What's your view on China and Hu Jintao's talking down the dollar and all these things that are happening?
[02:43:17.061 --> 02:43:20.268]  I mean, what's the Eagle Forum's position on Chinese relations?
[02:43:21.001 --> 02:43:23.263]  Well, I think China's the enemy.
[02:43:23.263 --> 02:43:31.270]  If you read any of the press that you get out of China, or you get India reporting on China, they hate us.
[02:43:31.270 --> 02:43:36.835]  They're building up their military because they want to be the one superpower, and they're doing it with our money.
[02:43:36.835 --> 02:43:38.857]  And I don't think we ought to let them do it.
[02:43:38.857 --> 02:43:47.404]  And this thing of Obama making nice with Wall Street, you know this CEO of General Electric who's pro-Obama,
[02:43:48.584 --> 02:43:48.965]  I don't know.
[02:44:04.147 --> 02:44:11.469]  But I think we ought to do something to reclaim a good American job in this country.
[02:44:11.469 --> 02:44:15.290]  That is what we need, and I don't hear anybody giving any good answers to that.
[02:44:15.290 --> 02:44:16.931]  Well, you get rid of NAFTA and GATT.
[02:44:16.931 --> 02:44:18.992]  We were told it was going to be wonderful by Al Gore.
[02:44:18.992 --> 02:44:19.612]  Look what it's done.
[02:44:19.612 --> 02:44:21.032]  Yeah, look what it's done.
[02:44:21.032 --> 02:44:21.672]  I agree with you.
[02:44:21.672 --> 02:44:23.373]  I was opposed to NAFTA.
[02:44:23.373 --> 02:44:24.853]  I was opposed to GATT.
[02:44:24.853 --> 02:44:29.695]  Incidentally, I think GATT's the one that was ran through in a lame duck session.
[02:44:30.453 --> 02:44:34.816]  And I think they decided against the U.S.
[02:44:34.816 --> 02:44:37.778]  in six out of seven cases they've had.
[02:44:37.778 --> 02:44:40.100]  So that's the way it is when you deal with these.
[02:44:40.100 --> 02:44:41.681]  Yeah, it's certainly one way.
[02:44:41.681 --> 02:44:48.466]  Now, getting into another issue, do you know Charlotte Isserby, who is the head of policy at the Department of Education?
[02:44:48.466 --> 02:44:50.447]  Yes, I do.
[02:44:50.447 --> 02:44:53.289]  What's your view of her work?
[02:44:53.289 --> 02:44:58.573]  Well, I haven't talked to Charlotte in a number of years, but she certainly did very good work.
[02:44:59.329 --> 02:45:04.814]  And exposed a lot of mischief in the education department and in the public school.
[02:45:04.814 --> 02:45:06.035]  Sure.
[02:45:06.035 --> 02:45:09.939]  My view on this is that I respect her and the work she's done.
[02:45:09.939 --> 02:45:21.270]  And you know, she's certainly said nice things about you, but overall, she's been critical and said that just like the left, and I don't see it as a leftist organization because they've got Republicans and Democrats,
[02:45:21.970 --> 02:45:23.392]  Well, they don't have any policy position.
[02:45:23.392 --> 02:45:24.593]  They just need to have a good time.
[02:45:43.488 --> 02:46:01.653]  Yeah, there's been kind of leftist professors and people over the years that have been kind of threatened by people exposing the CFR Trilateral Commission who are on record having, you know, the entire power elite in them pushing for globalism and world government.
[02:46:01.653 --> 02:46:05.474]  But then I get reports and, you know, hear people say that, you know, that really
[02:46:07.034 --> 02:46:16.660]  No, they haven't taken over the conservative movement.
[02:46:16.660 --> 02:46:28.306]  I urge people to be active in the Republican Party because that is the vehicle by which we can achieve our political goals.
[02:46:28.306 --> 02:46:30.567]  But you certainly are right about the CFR.
[02:46:30.567 --> 02:46:35.030]  I have a lot of objections to them, but one of the things I've talked about recently
[02:46:35.575 --> 02:46:36.956]  It's one of their papers they put out.
[02:46:36.956 --> 02:46:40.458]  You know, there are always people who are wanting to rewrite the Constitution.
[02:46:40.458 --> 02:46:42.479]  They think they can do a better job.
[02:46:42.479 --> 02:46:45.601]  And you know, what is the provision of the U.S.
[02:46:45.601 --> 02:46:48.503]  Constitution that the globalists hate the most?
[02:46:48.503 --> 02:46:55.587]  It is the treaty provision that says you've got to have a two-thirds vote in the Senate in order to ratify treaties.
[02:46:55.587 --> 02:46:59.110]  And they have manipulated around.
[02:46:59.110 --> 02:47:00.450]  NAFTA was not a treaty.
[02:47:00.450 --> 02:47:03.072]  It did not get the two-thirds vote.
[02:47:03.072 --> 02:47:04.493]  I don't believe that did either.
[02:47:05.086 --> 02:47:15.855]  And they've gone to a great length to try to get these international agreements through without obeying the treaty provisions of the Constitution, which I think is just great.
[02:47:15.855 --> 02:47:25.383]  Because most of those UN treaties cut a piece of our sovereignty out and give the control to some commission of left-wing so-called experts.
[02:47:26.827 --> 02:47:42.539]  Well, one other reason I brought up the CMP is I know any organization, with any organizational power, there are going to be people inside of it who have globalist tendencies, but I did see a Seymour Hersh report that said that the military in the U.S.
[02:47:42.539 --> 02:47:53.207]  is being run by the Knights of Malta and by Opus Di, and then I'd seen claims going back decades that those groups were powerful inside the CMP.
[02:47:53.207 --> 02:47:54.768]  What do you think of what Seymour Hersh is saying?
[02:47:55.933 --> 02:48:03.801]  Well, most people are all Catholics, and I can tell you there are not very many Catholics in PNP.
[02:48:03.801 --> 02:48:07.684]  Yeah, because I guess it's James Dobson and people who are Protestants in there.
[02:48:07.684 --> 02:48:10.928]  Oh, yeah, it's largely evangelical.
[02:48:10.928 --> 02:48:15.872]  And they don't have any policy statements.
[02:48:15.872 --> 02:48:18.435]  They just get together for the conviviality of it.
[02:48:20.948 --> 02:48:21.528]  Absolutely.
[02:48:21.528 --> 02:48:26.871]  And in Nice and Malta, most of what they do is charitable work.
[02:48:26.871 --> 02:48:29.472]  It's completely a Catholic organization.
[02:48:29.472 --> 02:48:31.053]  I don't think they have any political support at all.
[02:48:31.053 --> 02:48:31.573]  Absolutely.
[02:48:31.573 --> 02:48:37.836]  From looking at the CMP roles, it's predominantly Protestant, but at the same time, I mean, certainly there's powerful networks.
[02:48:37.836 --> 02:48:42.418]  Well, I'm sure they would be offended if you said the Nice and Malta, and over the day, ran it.
[02:48:42.418 --> 02:48:43.119]  Who would be offended?
[02:48:43.119 --> 02:48:45.240]  The members of the CMP.
[02:48:45.240 --> 02:48:49.902]  Yeah, well, I mean, I think anytime something's secret, people start asking questions.
[02:48:51.777 --> 02:48:56.879]  Uh, well, that's right.
[02:48:56.879 --> 02:48:59.240]  Tell me, what does go on at CMP meetings?
[02:48:59.240 --> 02:49:00.841]  Just speeches.
[02:49:00.841 --> 02:49:01.721]  Speeches and dinner.
[02:49:01.721 --> 02:49:03.802]  That's all.
[02:49:03.802 --> 02:49:06.123]  Just speeches and dinner.
[02:49:06.123 --> 02:49:08.764]  They don't pass any resolutions.
[02:49:08.764 --> 02:49:11.205]  They don't endorse any candidates.
[02:49:11.205 --> 02:49:12.626]  Was it set up by the Hunt brothers?
[02:49:14.888 --> 02:49:16.069]  Uh, no.
[02:49:16.069 --> 02:49:24.495]  I think in the early days, Bunker Hunt was a member, but the other Hunt, the famous one, was never a member.
[02:49:24.495 --> 02:49:24.675]  Sure.
[02:49:24.675 --> 02:49:29.619]  Well, I see things like Howard Phillips, who does, you know, fights NAFTA, GATT, the New World Order.
[02:49:29.619 --> 02:49:33.421]  He's pretty, I mean, I see good fruits from him, and I see you doing a lot of good work.
[02:49:33.421 --> 02:49:43.789]  I mean, I do see a lot of, you know, mainline, you know, what you call rock-ribbed Republican hardcore conservatives, you know, tend to turn a blind eye to a lot of big government stuff out of Republicans, but I'm glad to hear that
[02:49:44.429 --> 02:49:46.790]  I know for many years you've spoken out against that.
[02:49:46.790 --> 02:49:50.930]  And you know, Charlotte was saying, you know, to me on and off air, you know, you're one of the better members of that.
[02:49:50.930 --> 02:49:59.752]  She just is critical of CMP because when she tried to get into the, you know, Carnegie documents and others that came out, congressional hearings dealing with the plan to merge the U.S.
[02:49:59.752 --> 02:50:06.053]  and the Soviet Union together back in the 80s, that CMP didn't want to hear about it.
[02:50:06.053 --> 02:50:10.694]  Well, education has not been something that they've been particularly interested in.
[02:50:10.694 --> 02:50:13.555]  In fact, I'm complaining about that.
[02:50:14.533 --> 02:50:21.857]  I personally think that a lot of well-to-do people have their children in private schools, and they don't care what happens to the public schools.
[02:50:21.857 --> 02:50:22.217]  Sure.
[02:50:22.217 --> 02:50:32.763]  And while I pay a lot for private schools and private colleges, I recognize that 89% of the kids in this country go to public schools, and we're paying for them.
[02:50:32.763 --> 02:50:40.988]  And I feel they should be taught the correct American history, and they should not be taught that they should forget what their parents
[02:50:41.628 --> 02:50:45.111]  All right, Phyllis Lavely, stay there.
[02:50:45.111 --> 02:50:45.872]  Final segment with you.
[02:50:45.872 --> 02:50:49.795]  I want to get into other topics that you think are most important in the five minutes we have left.
[02:50:49.795 --> 02:50:52.017]  And then an incredible Haritz headline.
[02:50:52.017 --> 02:50:52.738]  I was just handed it.
[02:50:52.738 --> 02:50:55.200]  We're going to link it up at InfoWars and Prison Planet.
[02:50:55.200 --> 02:50:57.983]  Security scanner blamed for woman's death.
[02:50:57.983 --> 02:51:00.425]  They're using these x-ray scanners on the highways in the U.S.
[02:51:00.425 --> 02:51:01.386]  The Army is in New York.
[02:51:02.242 --> 02:51:06.326]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[02:51:06.326 --> 02:51:10.830]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[02:51:10.830 --> 02:51:16.995]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[02:51:16.995 --> 02:51:19.418]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[02:51:19.418 --> 02:51:25.383]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[02:51:25.503 --> 02:51:28.926]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[02:51:28.926 --> 02:51:30.788]  There is no other program of its kind.
[02:51:30.788 --> 02:51:32.969]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[02:51:32.969 --> 02:51:37.854]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.
[02:51:37.854 --> 02:51:38.674]  Guaranteed.
[02:51:38.674 --> 02:51:42.718]  Prevent wage garnishments, bank levies, and stop collection calls with our proven program.
[02:51:42.978 --> 02:51:47.761]  Call Zero Debt in 90 days now, 800-477-9256, and ask for free information from an expert who also completed our program.

[02:52:02.927 --> 02:52:06.948]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:06.948 --> 02:52:10.189]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:10.189 --> 02:52:14.990]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:52:14.990 --> 02:52:21.372]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:21.372 --> 02:52:23.613]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:52:24.173 --> 02:52:24.473]  Tim Geithner?
[02:52:24.473 --> 02:52:24.714]  Bernanke?
[02:52:24.714 --> 02:52:25.294]  They're arsonists!
[02:52:25.294 --> 02:52:26.095]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:26.095 --> 02:52:28.438]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:43.055 --> 02:52:47.436]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[02:52:47.436 --> 02:52:50.337]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:53:01.360 --> 02:53:04.262]  Going solar for cheap is as easy as 123.
[02:53:04.262 --> 02:53:10.386]  If you want to go solar but thought the setup costs were too high, now you can build your own solar panels for less than $200.
[02:53:10.386 --> 02:53:11.146]  Don't laugh!
[02:53:11.146 --> 02:53:14.088]  We've sold over 45,000 solar do-it-yourself kits.

[02:53:30.899 --> 02:53:32.140]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:53:32.140 --> 02:53:36.703]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:53:36.703 --> 02:53:42.507]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:53:42.507 --> 02:53:46.129]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:53:46.129 --> 02:53:48.851]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:53:48.851 --> 02:53:53.914]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:53:53.914 --> 02:53:54.155]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:53:54.155 --> 02:53:55.556]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:54:02.462 --> 02:54:09.353]  I say I shot the sheriff But I swear it was in self-defense
[02:54:34.817 --> 02:54:44.922]  Folks, you can't make this stuff up.
[02:54:44.922 --> 02:54:46.283]  Haritz reporting.
[02:54:46.283 --> 02:54:49.305]  Security scanner blamed for woman's death.
[02:54:49.305 --> 02:54:50.105]  A body scanner.
[02:54:50.105 --> 02:54:54.908]  We're going to get an article out on that at InfoWars.com in the next 30 minutes.
[02:54:54.908 --> 02:54:55.568]  Kurt's working on it.
[02:54:55.568 --> 02:54:56.689]  Also, study.
[02:54:56.689 --> 02:54:59.431]  Genghis Khan's mass killing cut carbon footprint.
[02:55:00.331 --> 02:55:07.074]  We've got a report on that, but it's also being reported on by the New York Times.
[02:55:07.074 --> 02:55:12.416]  They're giving volunteers, giving speed cameras all over the country to spy on citizens.
[02:55:12.416 --> 02:55:15.358]  Phyllis Schlafly, finishing up with the environmentalists.
[02:55:15.358 --> 02:55:18.699]  These aren't even environmentalists in my research, they're eugenicists.
[02:55:18.699 --> 02:55:22.601]  And more and more they're saying, look, it isn't even about carbon, it's about getting rid of people.
[02:55:22.601 --> 02:55:25.942]  We have Ted Turner praising the one-child policy of China.
[02:55:25.942 --> 02:55:27.083]  How do we stop these people?
[02:55:28.366 --> 02:55:38.448]  Well, I think we have to keep speaking up against them because there are people who want to worship the earth instead of God, and there are people who want to limit the number of people.
[02:55:38.448 --> 02:55:41.489]  They simply want to get rid of a lot of the people.
[02:55:41.489 --> 02:55:50.931]  And let me mention before we run out of time, Alex, and if you run out of things to talk about on this program, you can always go to my website, EagleForum.org.
[02:55:50.931 --> 02:55:52.931]  All kinds of wonderful information.
[02:55:54.668 --> 02:55:55.268]  Absolutely.
[02:55:55.268 --> 02:55:59.330]  You guys do do a lot of good work, and you're fighting the North American Union.
[02:55:59.330 --> 02:56:01.711]  Where do you see the SPP going?
[02:56:01.711 --> 02:56:13.796]  Well, that was the Bush Project, and I think Obama is really more wanting to distribute our wealth to the rest of the world.
[02:56:13.796 --> 02:56:17.617]  He isn't confining it just to North America.
[02:56:17.617 --> 02:56:19.638]  But he hasn't done anything to close the border.
[02:56:20.348 --> 02:56:29.554]  And he did meet once or twice with the Mexican President, but that doesn't seem to be high on his agenda.
[02:56:29.554 --> 02:56:32.575]  But I'm certainly against erasing the border.
[02:56:32.575 --> 02:56:37.718]  We want the United States the way it is, and we don't want to combine with any other country.
[02:56:37.718 --> 02:56:45.363]  And I do think the disaffection with the euro has cooled off a lot of people on this idea of moving into
[02:56:46.031 --> 02:56:52.655]  I can't imagine, but they're sending their people in here and teaching their kids that Mexico really owns California, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, and Arizona.
[02:57:12.996 --> 02:57:15.978]  And they should not be taught that in the public schools.
[02:57:15.978 --> 02:57:20.501]  I think we should have them taught the truth and not lies like that.
[02:57:20.501 --> 02:57:22.062]  Well, I mean, I wouldn't even call that liberal.
[02:57:22.062 --> 02:57:24.304]  That's the globalist agenda through our schools.
[02:57:24.304 --> 02:57:26.385]  And, you know, why did Bush push all of that?
[02:57:26.385 --> 02:57:28.426]  Just like Clinton, just like Obama.
[02:57:28.426 --> 02:57:32.950]  And that's my whole point about, you know, really going after conservatives and holding their feet to the fire.
[02:57:32.950 --> 02:57:40.174]  I've not been a fan of Rick Perry, but he's trying to, you know, restrict abortions here and trying to make women get sonograms, which is, I think, a good thing.
[02:57:40.174 --> 02:57:40.895]  What's your view on that?
[02:57:41.631 --> 02:57:49.393]  Uh, yes, and I think if you see the new polls, uh, well, of course, most of the Republicans who were elected in November are pro-life.
[02:57:49.393 --> 02:57:51.474]  It is just amazing change.
[02:57:51.474 --> 02:57:55.075]  And the change in the public opinion polls is great.
[02:57:55.075 --> 02:57:58.316]  And I attribute a lot of that to the picture.
[02:57:58.316 --> 02:57:59.977]  You know, we're a kind of picture society.
[02:57:59.977 --> 02:58:01.977]  People don't read much anymore.
[02:58:01.977 --> 02:58:05.598]  And when you look at the picture, they say, oh, that looks like a baby.
[02:58:05.598 --> 02:58:07.459]  Even a second grader can figure that out.
[02:58:09.412 --> 02:58:10.032]  Absolutely.
[02:58:10.032 --> 02:58:14.713]  Well, Phyllis Schlafly, thank you for coming on and being interrogated about things here.
[02:58:14.713 --> 02:58:20.795]  And we really appreciate you spending time with us and look forward to talking to you again in the near future as things unfold.
[02:58:20.795 --> 02:58:23.076]  EagleForum.org.
[02:58:23.076 --> 02:58:25.136]  We'll talk to you again in the near future.
[02:58:25.136 --> 02:58:26.557]  Have a great week coming up.
[02:58:26.557 --> 02:58:27.357]  Have a great day.
[02:58:27.757 --> 02:58:29.500]  Alright, there goes Phyllis Schenefly.
[02:58:29.500 --> 02:58:34.409]  And, uh, I, uh, brought up the CMP witch hunt thing while she was on with us.
[02:58:34.409 --> 02:58:38.036]  Uh, ladies and gentlemen, get this story about Ventura suing them out to everybody.
[02:58:38.036 --> 02:58:40.801]  It points out the sexual abuse they want to put on all of us.
