[00:00:05.083 --> 00:00:09.908]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.908 --> 00:00:11.509]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:13.051]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.051 --> 00:00:17.255]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.255 --> 00:00:21.319]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.591 --> 00:00:38.818]  Oh, no!
[00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.431]  Well, my friends, we are back.
[00:00:45.431 --> 00:00:57.194]  It is another Global Transmission Against Tyranny on this Wednesday, the 12th day of October, 2011 edition, and we're going to be here live for the next three hours.
[00:00:57.194 --> 00:01:01.716]  I know I have some guests tonight on InfoWars Nightly News that are lined up.
[00:01:01.716 --> 00:01:09.038]  We're working on a couple of guests that are topical to news that's unfolding right now, but they are not in the boat yet, so we'll
[00:01:09.778 --> 00:01:13.040]  Pretty much just have open phones today, which I'm leaning towards doing to begin with.
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.361]  We're not working too hard on guests.
[00:01:15.361 --> 00:01:18.563]  Because I want to hear from you and have time to cover all of the news.
[00:01:18.563 --> 00:01:22.064]  Wow, everything is transpiring.
[00:01:22.064 --> 00:01:25.826]  Unfortunately, as we predicted it would.
[00:01:25.826 --> 00:01:30.529]  To a nauseating level for those of us that are awake and aware of the global agenda.
[00:01:31.543 --> 00:02:00.533]  You look at the sheeple, the blind, dumbed-down public who has no idea what's going on, and it's very sad to watch them swatted around like a large alley cat plays with a tiny field mouse, gnawing on it, swatting it with its claws, watching the blood trickle as it squirms in pain and agony, the cat vampirically feeding on the fear pouring out of the tiny diminutive creature.
[00:02:02.026 --> 00:02:08.111]  I would really like this torturous situation to turn around.
[00:02:08.111 --> 00:02:09.913]  I'd really like to rout the scum.
[00:02:11.733 --> 00:02:40.724]  And history has shown that if we boldly tell people what's going to happen, and it happens, our credibility will rise, and the people will listen to our historical analysis and our historical solutions, and that we can defeat the wicked before they fully take over the society and set up a Stalinistic, Maoistic, Hitleristic, Pol Pot-ish type mass murder house, which for the psychopaths of tyranny is beautiful.
[00:02:42.168 --> 00:02:51.672]  I don't find their spectrum, their crack of doom, their hellish vortices to be beautiful.
[00:02:51.672 --> 00:02:59.516]  I find it to be extremely painful to have to look into and focus on to understand it.
[00:02:59.516 --> 00:03:02.337]  And yes, it has left me twisted.
[00:03:02.337 --> 00:03:05.479]  Eighteen years of studying evil.
[00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:07.680]  I am certainly a tortured soul.
[00:03:08.985 --> 00:03:15.270]  But the rest of our Republic and the rest of the world is also tortured by this, even if you're not conscious of it.
[00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:32.124]  Your subconscious mind, your spirit, your soul, your cord, your discernment, your deeper regions of the brain, all of the deeper facets of the mind and of the being, the body, are all too aware of the things happening.
[00:03:32.124 --> 00:03:37.929]  We hide a lot of ourselves, but the truth still stares back from the abyss, does it not?
[00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:51.035]  Okay, let me just break down the fact, for those of you that just joined us, that we have a big broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:03:51.035 --> 00:04:00.861]  To say the least, in the words of James Dillingpole, writing for the London Telegraph, Australia has committed suicide.
[00:04:00.861 --> 00:04:05.724]  If they implement this, they have committed absolute insider
[00:04:07.978 --> 00:04:11.220]  Futile taxes on all human activity.
[00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:20.767]  They have passed and expanded huge carbon taxes on all human activity.
[00:04:20.767 --> 00:04:22.908]  So that is coming up today.
[00:04:22.908 --> 00:04:27.452]  And I'm going to tie that in here in Austin, Texas.
[00:04:27.452 --> 00:04:36.318]  They're not going to build a big skyscraper downtown because the city panel has voted to save downtown tree, a
[00:04:38.837 --> 00:04:41.238]  Pecan tree.
[00:04:41.238 --> 00:04:44.658]  And so now people can't build on their own property.
[00:04:44.658 --> 00:04:48.099]  Of course, if you're a globalist, you get a waiver to that.
[00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:49.580]  That's not even the news, though.
[00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.620]  We have giant news on Fast and Furious.
[00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.162]  They're trying to smokescreen with a terror threat out of Iran.
[00:04:57.162 --> 00:04:58.642]  We're gonna get into the 999 and more.
[00:05:00.462 --> 00:05:01.622]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:05:01.622 --> 00:05:08.565]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:05:08.565 --> 00:05:11.126]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:05:11.126 --> 00:05:16.487]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:05:16.487 --> 00:05:19.528]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:05:19.528 --> 00:05:21.589]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:28.094]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:05:28.094 --> 00:05:31.476]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:05:31.476 --> 00:05:37.261]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:05:37.261 --> 00:05:38.902]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:05:38.902 --> 00:05:40.203]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:05:40.203 --> 00:05:42.885]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:05:42.885 --> 00:05:47.108]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:05:47.108 --> 00:05:48.809]  You can find the video at www.
[00:05:50.130 --> 00:06:02.701]  You can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.
[00:06:02.701 --> 00:06:14.972]  Alex has told you about the amazing, great tasting, long-term, storable food from eFoodsDirect and how a food savings account is your best insurance against natural disasters, job loss, and high food costs.
[00:06:14.972 --> 00:06:17.514]  But did you know that this dehydrated food also
[00:06:17.554 --> 00:06:18.134]  We're good to go.
[00:06:33.766 --> 00:06:34.146]  We're good to go.
[00:07:01.337 --> 00:07:05.359]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:07:05.359 --> 00:07:08.600]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:13.402]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:07:13.402 --> 00:07:19.785]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:07:19.785 --> 00:07:22.026]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:07:22.486 --> 00:07:22.786]  Tim Geithner?
[00:07:22.786 --> 00:07:23.027]  Bernanke?
[00:07:23.027 --> 00:07:23.407]  They're arsonists!
[00:07:23.407 --> 00:07:24.108]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:07:24.108 --> 00:07:26.190]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:07:41.468 --> 00:07:48.755]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:07:48.755 --> 00:07:57.945]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:08:05.305 --> 00:08:10.129]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover Ups.
[00:08:10.129 --> 00:08:11.730]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:13.271]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.271 --> 00:08:17.474]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.474 --> 00:08:30.583]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:30.583 --> 00:08:32.064]  Well, it is Wednesday.
[00:08:32.064 --> 00:08:33.706]  It is the 12th day
[00:08:35.896 --> 00:08:50.546]  of October 2011, and Kurt Haskell, the lawyer who barely survived the wicked underwear bombing two Christmases ago, along with his wife, he'd been called as the only witness by the underwear bomber.
[00:08:51.465 --> 00:08:57.847]  Haskell asked me privately what I thought was going on, and I said, he's being threatened, his family, other things.
[00:08:57.847 --> 00:09:03.408]  He doesn't play along with the Patsy plot that he's been set up in.
[00:09:03.408 --> 00:09:04.509]  That's the past MO.
[00:09:04.509 --> 00:09:06.769]  That's how the globals operate over and over again, generally.
[00:09:06.769 --> 00:09:09.450]  They've got a few other permutations.
[00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:11.410]  And I said, they're using you for leverage.
[00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:13.091]  He's threatening if he doesn't get a better deal.
[00:09:14.231 --> 00:09:23.373]  And if they don't back off, that he's gonna go ahead and continue to fight this as not guilty and call you as a witness.
[00:09:23.373 --> 00:09:25.014]  And I said, I think it's leverage.
[00:09:25.014 --> 00:09:31.275]  In fact, I told him when the show ended, when he was on InfoWars Nightly News the other night, after the interview, he said, what do you really think's going on?
[00:09:31.275 --> 00:09:34.096]  And I said, he's using you for leverage?
[00:09:34.096 --> 00:09:37.757]  And I said, he might even change his plea.
[00:09:37.757 --> 00:09:38.977]  I told Haskell that.
[00:09:40.021 --> 00:09:42.202]  And that indeed has happened today.
[00:09:42.202 --> 00:09:51.165]  Haskell would not tell me what he thinks is going on because he said that might be used to prejudice his testimony.
[00:09:51.165 --> 00:09:57.127]  They would say it was prejudiced or to discredit it if he was called as a lone witness for the underwear bomber.
[00:09:57.127 --> 00:10:03.329]  This is going to be breaking news when he joins us coming up here
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.461]  At the bottom of the hour.
[00:10:06.461 --> 00:10:09.242]  I'm also working on getting James Dillingpole on from the Telegraph.
[00:10:09.242 --> 00:10:13.123]  He's got the headline today that Australia commits suicide.
[00:10:13.123 --> 00:10:16.104]  And I've just been told Dillingpole will be on with that.
[00:10:16.104 --> 00:10:21.286]  Protesters disrupt questions time after carbon bill passes lower house.
[00:10:21.286 --> 00:10:22.527]  And it's totally unpopular.
[00:10:22.527 --> 00:10:25.708]  I've seen polls of close to 90%.
[00:10:25.708 --> 00:10:28.229]  The governments have been removed the last five years over this.
[00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:37.475]  They're laying half the farmland off limits in Australia already, and now this is home inspections, giant taxes.
[00:10:37.475 --> 00:10:43.279]  It's just unbelievable, and it has nothing to do with saving the earth.
[00:10:43.279 --> 00:10:47.842]  They list carbon dioxide part of the life cycle.
[00:10:47.842 --> 00:10:58.730]  They list carbon dioxide part of the life cycle as a toxic waste, and then they can just control everything and tax everything selectively while giving waivers to inside globalist organizations.
[00:11:00.057 --> 00:11:06.427]  And more importantly, it then distracts from all the real environmental issues like toxic waste dumping.
[00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:29.478]  GMO cross-species hybrid clone chimeras now in the tens of thousands, glowing monkeys, glowing cats, fish that have got dozens of insect and other fish genes, mutagenic bacteria, viruses giving rise, pre-marker programming with antibiotics into cell walls for gene
[00:11:30.419 --> 00:11:35.723]  Adherence testing already giving incredible rise to unbelievable mutagenic qualities.
[00:11:35.723 --> 00:11:38.745]  I mean, we are living in a petri dish of disaster here.
[00:11:38.745 --> 00:11:40.866]  A genetic Armageddon.
[00:11:40.866 --> 00:11:48.851]  And all of the surly know-it-all control freaks scurrying around talking about carbon dioxide that plants respirate from.
[00:11:48.851 --> 00:11:51.033]  It's, by the way, very low in the atmosphere. 0.360.
[00:11:55.473 --> 00:12:02.555]  It is, if it wasn't so dangerous to myself and my family and you, it would be hilarious.
[00:12:02.555 --> 00:12:04.436]  In fact, it is hilarious.
[00:12:04.436 --> 00:12:05.476]  But it's gallows humor.
[00:12:05.476 --> 00:12:12.438]  I was at dinner with my parents last night and my wife and children got tired so they left and we sat around for about 30 minutes talking and I was laughing about horrible things.
[00:12:12.438 --> 00:12:13.258]  My dad got offended.
[00:12:13.258 --> 00:12:15.619]  He was like, what are you, this isn't funny, it's sectic.
[00:12:15.619 --> 00:12:19.340]  I said, listen, it's gallows humor.
[00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:20.881]  I was like, it's not going to matter soon, dad.
[00:12:20.881 --> 00:12:21.681]  They're going to release these
[00:12:22.759 --> 00:12:24.400]  Nanotech-engineered viruses.
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:25.760]  They admit they've got it.
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.301]  They can put the food spray in the air.
[00:12:27.301 --> 00:12:33.524]  They go in and attack receptor sites in the brain, giving you a selective lobotomy where you can't even get upset anymore.
[00:12:33.524 --> 00:12:36.586]  They're calling it anti-stress vaccines, anti-drug vaccines.
[00:12:36.586 --> 00:12:38.947]  And I predict they're already releasing them.
[00:12:38.947 --> 00:12:40.427]  I see some evidence of that.
[00:12:40.427 --> 00:12:42.768]  But they're testing lower forms of them.
[00:12:42.768 --> 00:12:43.569]  And we're screwed.
[00:12:43.569 --> 00:12:44.269]  I mean, it's over.
[00:12:44.269 --> 00:12:46.690]  Just total psycho world.
[00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:47.831]  Unless we totally wake up.
[00:12:49.121 --> 00:12:53.902]  And I started laughing about it, because it's all I can do or I'm gonna cry.
[00:12:53.902 --> 00:12:56.083]  Oh God, help me.
[00:12:56.083 --> 00:13:00.884]  Is there no end to it?
[00:13:00.884 --> 00:13:10.007]  By our naivete, we have allowed the most evil people you can imagine in history to be in control of society.
[00:13:10.007 --> 00:13:16.689]  And I watch Mitt Romney, I watch Herman Cain, I watch Rick Perry, Chris Christie,
[00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:32.483]  That demonic monster being hailed as great conservatives when all of these men have worked deeply for the New World Order, going to Bilderberg, heading up the Federal Reserve, writing socialist health care bills.
[00:13:32.483 --> 00:13:44.634]  I haven't even pointed out, I finally went this morning because I heard it brought up last night about one of Romney's weak points is he's anti-gun and I knew he wasn't pro-gun but I didn't know he was basically for banning
[00:13:45.623 --> 00:13:47.424]  Owning handguns?
[00:13:47.424 --> 00:13:51.027]  We might as well elect Dennis Kucinich as the Republican nominee.
[00:13:51.027 --> 00:13:57.172]  I like Dennis at certain levels because he's this guy who really believes in what he's saying and is against some Wall Street corruption.
[00:13:57.172 --> 00:14:01.155]  I think he really believes in what he stands for.
[00:14:01.155 --> 00:14:07.860]  Even if I don't agree with a lot of what he says, at least the fact that he is the same over time, you know, that's a positive thing.
[00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:09.441]  But I wouldn't vote for Dennis Kucinich.
[00:14:12.145 --> 00:14:14.726]  He says ban handguns.
[00:14:14.726 --> 00:14:16.427]  Mitt Romney does.
[00:14:16.427 --> 00:14:21.290]  And I've got to watch Republicans go, well, Mitt Romney looks presidential.
[00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:23.651]  So he wrote the health care bill.
[00:14:23.651 --> 00:14:24.751]  So he's for gun control.
[00:14:24.751 --> 00:14:28.713]  So he prays for supporting carbon taxes.
[00:14:28.713 --> 00:14:33.696]  And I get emails from weirdo Romney supporters telling me I'm lying about this and stuff.
[00:14:33.696 --> 00:14:36.077]  Look, he's even worse than I thought.
[00:14:38.046 --> 00:14:48.511]  I remember years ago telling you that he worked for Al Gore, Perry, and that he was for open borders, and amnesty, and sanctuary cities, and free tuition, and on and on and on.
[00:14:48.511 --> 00:14:51.432]  Anchor baby funding, everything.
[00:14:51.432 --> 00:14:54.634]  Then he went to Bilderberg, and he supported all this stuff.
[00:14:54.634 --> 00:14:56.374]  He supported Hillarycare.
[00:14:56.374 --> 00:14:57.795]  And people would just say, you're a liar.
[00:14:57.795 --> 00:15:01.437]  I'd get attacked by the Dallas blog and others saying I was making it up.
[00:15:02.814 --> 00:15:05.635]  Look, they know full well the truth.
[00:15:05.635 --> 00:15:08.537]  They just play you like you're idiots.
[00:15:08.537 --> 00:15:12.839]  And so, I guess I don't look as Ken Doll-ish as Mitt Romney or Rick Perry.
[00:15:12.839 --> 00:15:17.941]  Some people say, well, Alex doesn't look like a Ken Doll.
[00:15:17.941 --> 00:15:20.362]  And so, he must be the liar.
[00:15:20.362 --> 00:15:23.623]  Okay, whatever then.
[00:15:23.623 --> 00:15:31.407]  And Chris Christie, I mean, the fact that he would endorse Mitt Romney, that's everything you ever need to know about Chris Christie.
[00:15:32.639 --> 00:15:39.738]  He's got this blunt, fake, tough guy talk where we're going to cut the welfare, we're going to throw the welfare bums out on the street.
[00:15:39.738 --> 00:15:40.039]  Great!
[00:15:40.039 --> 00:15:40.801]  Throw them out on the street!
[00:15:42.912 --> 00:15:49.936]  But then don't support somebody who wants to take my Second Amendment right to protect myself from the people thrown out on the street.
[00:15:49.936 --> 00:15:58.780]  And don't talk about cancelling infrastructure tunnels and things and how you're going to get our budget straight when you're supporting the banker bailouts and things for Wall Street.
[00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:07.425]  Because nothing, you could cut everything in the world and it wouldn't do anything to those derivatives that Mitt Romney and others have supported.
[00:16:09.755 --> 00:16:14.218]  I mean Herman Cain last night said that he... I got some big breaking news.
[00:16:14.218 --> 00:16:18.461]  You know, I tend to not even cover the big breaking news when I get first on air.
[00:16:18.461 --> 00:16:21.643]  Most shows hype up how big the news is and how powerful.
[00:16:21.643 --> 00:16:27.908]  I have a tendency to just drop bombshell after bombshell and not even point out it's bombshell, which is a problem I have.
[00:16:29.921 --> 00:16:35.727]  I predicted the Justice Department would hype up terror threats as Fast and Furious breathed down their neck.
[00:16:35.727 --> 00:16:36.988]  And guess what?
[00:16:36.988 --> 00:16:37.989]  It happened.
[00:16:37.989 --> 00:16:39.010]  Not that I'm smart.
[00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:40.472]  They got a playbook.
[00:16:40.472 --> 00:16:41.413]  I got the playbook.
[00:16:44.534 --> 00:16:54.157]  I mean, it's like the Patriots got in trouble years ago for sneaking into events and stealing playbooks from other teams and secretly videotaping playbooks.
[00:16:54.157 --> 00:16:55.978]  What do you think you do in a war?
[00:16:55.978 --> 00:16:58.499]  What do you think football is?
[00:16:58.499 --> 00:16:59.439]  It's a war.
[00:16:59.439 --> 00:17:07.121]  The biggest part of football is spying on the other teams, watching the tapes, getting their playbooks.
[00:17:07.121 --> 00:17:08.642]  It's like a nation of children.
[00:17:11.274 --> 00:17:12.914]  Well, I've got the globalist playbook.
[00:17:12.914 --> 00:17:15.075]  I read what they actually say in their councils.
[00:17:15.075 --> 00:17:16.435]  They've been so arrogant.
[00:17:16.435 --> 00:17:21.716]  They publish in limited runs, but they publish what they're doing to us.
[00:17:21.716 --> 00:17:33.679]  The CFR has written hundreds of times that I've read in their own publication how they're going to destroy America, set up a world government, how they're going to bring in collectivism, carbon taxes, geoengineering, the whole nine.
[00:17:33.679 --> 00:17:40.601]  I'm sitting here reading their stinking playbooks, publishing their playbooks for you, showing them to you day after day.
[00:17:41.854 --> 00:17:47.696]  Herman Cain is a hardcore running back for the New World Order.
[00:17:47.696 --> 00:17:52.738]  Chris Christie is a big fat sinner.
[00:17:52.738 --> 00:17:56.399]  Rick Perry and Mitt Romney are both limp-wristed quarterbacks.
[00:17:56.399 --> 00:18:00.721]  You know, where they got two quarterbacks on the same team and the system doesn't know which one to start.
[00:18:03.632 --> 00:18:08.214]  And they just might send that running back Herman Cain right through into the end zone.
[00:18:08.214 --> 00:18:12.216]  And conservatives are like, oh, we've won, Herman Cain.
[00:18:12.216 --> 00:18:17.718]  A guy that says he thinks the best Federal Reserve person he knows is Alan Greenspan.
[00:18:17.718 --> 00:18:24.642]  This is the guy who got rid of Glass-Steagall with Robert Rubin and the rest of them.
[00:18:24.642 --> 00:18:29.304]  Larry Summers, Jamie Diamond, Henry Paulson.
[00:18:30.717 --> 00:18:32.278]  He was the head of Goldman Sachs at the time.
[00:18:32.278 --> 00:18:42.443]  This whole crew, and Herman Cain's like, we didn't mess stuff up in the early 90s when I was the head of the Federal Reserve, when I was on the board, the head of the Kansas City Fed.
[00:18:42.443 --> 00:18:43.803]  That's made man-level.
[00:18:43.803 --> 00:18:47.705]  That's right beneath the top of the pyramid.
[00:18:47.705 --> 00:18:51.527]  And that's as high as it gets until you're an actual owner, like the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers.
[00:18:51.527 --> 00:18:54.108]  That's a king gopher, imperial legate.
[00:18:54.108 --> 00:18:55.189]  And I'm going to play this clip later.
[00:18:56.482 --> 00:18:58.864]  He's up there going, I really liked Alan Greenspan.
[00:18:58.864 --> 00:19:01.125]  He didn't cause all these problems that we got today.
[00:19:01.125 --> 00:19:02.046]  What?
[00:19:02.046 --> 00:19:11.512]  The guy he recommended is the current head of the Fed, Osama Bin Bernanke.
[00:19:11.512 --> 00:19:13.193]  Mr. Helicopter Bin.
[00:19:13.193 --> 00:19:16.375]  And he thinks we're all stupid.
[00:19:16.375 --> 00:19:17.236]  And Herman Cain
[00:19:18.479 --> 00:19:24.886]  Get's up there in front of the whole world and says, well, I like the guy that didn't cause these problems, Alan Greenspan.
[00:19:24.886 --> 00:19:32.655]  That's like saying, you know, at Nuremberg, I move that we make Hitler a patron saint because he fought against Hitler.
[00:19:32.655 --> 00:19:34.597]  He's the guy that set all this up.
[00:19:34.597 --> 00:19:38.241]  And then there they are throwing their current minion under the bus, Ben Bernanke.
[00:19:39.414 --> 00:19:41.655]  Then he got caught in a lie by Ron Paul.
[00:19:41.655 --> 00:19:45.816]  He said, Ron, you're lying about me not liking the, you know, not wanting to audit the Fed.
[00:19:45.816 --> 00:19:47.456]  I've always said audit the Fed.
[00:19:47.456 --> 00:19:49.577]  And I never called people stupid that wanted that.
[00:19:49.577 --> 00:19:50.837]  We've got the audio clips.
[00:19:50.837 --> 00:19:52.958]  We've got Herman Cain's book.
[00:19:52.958 --> 00:19:54.478]  Can't say he misspoke there.
[00:19:54.478 --> 00:19:56.579]  And he said, you've misrepresented me.
[00:19:56.579 --> 00:19:59.640]  Hoping that people won't go find out he's a big, fat liar.
[00:20:00.896 --> 00:20:08.240]  HempUSA.org has a revolutionary wonder food for detoxing the body and rebuilding the immune system.

[00:20:31.731 --> 00:20:36.314]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:20:36.314 --> 00:20:42.118]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold before your retirement.
[00:20:42.118 --> 00:20:45.760]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:48.582]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[00:21:04.993 --> 00:21:06.494]  Everyone can feel it.
[00:21:06.494 --> 00:21:15.399]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[00:21:15.399 --> 00:21:18.822]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising.
[00:21:18.822 --> 00:21:19.862]  But take heart.
[00:21:19.862 --> 00:21:23.665]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[00:21:23.665 --> 00:21:28.648]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war.
[00:21:29.048 --> 00:21:32.889]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[00:21:32.889 --> 00:21:34.630]  The globalists are scared.
[00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:35.970]  They've overreached.
[00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:39.471]  The future of the info war is in your hands.

[00:22:00.325 --> 00:22:07.650]  Did you know nuclear radiation is still spewing out of the melted-down reactors in Fukushima, Japan and making its way across the entire U.S.
[00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:10.673]  continent, contaminating the air, water, and food?
[00:22:10.673 --> 00:22:13.675]  Dangerously high levels of radiation are a reality here.
[00:22:13.675 --> 00:22:18.459]  As a result, radiation poisoning is a distinct possibility for anyone living in the U.S.
[00:22:18.459 --> 00:22:20.661]  unless you do something to protect yourself.

[00:24:12.115 --> 00:24:14.097]  Watch me!
[00:24:14.097 --> 00:24:15.459]  I got it.
[00:24:15.459 --> 00:24:16.981]  Hey!
[00:24:16.981 --> 00:24:20.525]  I got something that makes me wanna shout.
[00:24:20.525 --> 00:24:23.868]  I got something that tells me what it's all about.
[00:24:23.868 --> 00:24:28.414]  I got a soul, and I'm super bad.
[00:24:28.414 --> 00:24:29.134]  I got the truth!
[00:24:35.179 --> 00:24:38.121]  Alright, we are back live.
[00:24:38.121 --> 00:24:41.744]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:24:41.744 --> 00:24:53.431]  You know, we've got huge information that's going to be breaking here with the lone witness that was going to be called by the underwear bomber who was gotten on the plane by the U.S.
[00:24:53.431 --> 00:24:56.273]  government and that's admitted.
[00:24:56.273 --> 00:25:01.096]  Underwear bomber guilty plea shields government complicity reveals
[00:25:03.322 --> 00:25:09.870]  The fact that the government is desperate for this not to come to court and to a jury.
[00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:16.577]  Reversal means identity of well-dressed man will remain unknown.
[00:25:16.577 --> 00:25:21.543]  That's a Paul Joseph Watson article at Infowars.com right now.
[00:25:22.725 --> 00:25:25.567]  Kurt Haskell's coming up in the next segment.
[00:25:25.567 --> 00:25:33.173]  Then, at the start of the next hour, for one segment, James Dillingpole joins us to track the global government's main taxing system.
[00:25:33.173 --> 00:25:37.577]  That, of course, is the carbon tax, allied with a VAT and sales tax.
[00:25:37.577 --> 00:25:47.164]  Anyone proposing that, you know, works for the private central banks, like Herman Cain with the 999, which is going to be the 20-20-20, and the 30-30-30, the OECD that
[00:25:51.501 --> 00:25:53.682]  Is the receivership arm for the big central banks.
[00:25:53.682 --> 00:26:02.483]  They've said they want around a global 90% tax rate on the general population to totally control every facet of your life.
[00:26:02.483 --> 00:26:07.084]  And so it will end up being the 30-30-30 plan.
[00:26:07.084 --> 00:26:11.525]  And of course we'll have federal control in every country over every facet, every purchase you make.
[00:26:11.525 --> 00:26:13.166]  Tracking the sales taxes.
[00:26:13.166 --> 00:26:14.746]  Tracking all industry.
[00:26:14.746 --> 00:26:20.027]  New bureaucracy as if the gates of a bureaucratic Hades are opened.
[00:26:21.713 --> 00:26:23.694]  That is all coming up.
[00:26:23.694 --> 00:26:33.300]  Now, after we get this update from Kurt Haskell, I'll take some calls.
[00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:38.924]  Then, after we get a little update from Dylan Paul, I'll take some calls.
[00:26:40.066 --> 00:26:45.951]  But after Dillingpole leaves us at 20 after next hour, I'm only getting him on for one segment because I've got a long way to go and a short time to get there.
[00:26:45.951 --> 00:26:47.952]  I'm going to get to our top story today.
[00:26:47.952 --> 00:26:49.233]  And this is so big!
[00:26:49.233 --> 00:26:56.379]  I'm going to play the clips of Herman Cain caught lying, then the clips of him saying what he said he didn't say, and it's in his book as well.
[00:26:56.379 --> 00:27:02.544]  When Ron Paul said, hey, you said we don't need to audit the Fed, Herman Cain said, that's ridiculous, I never said that, how dare you!
[00:27:04.298 --> 00:27:13.985]  What a con man, and Ron Paul goes, we'll have to get that then, Herman, because they're going to use that clip from the, you watch, from that debate last night.
[00:27:13.985 --> 00:27:21.571]  They're going to cut to Cain saying it all, and his book, not just saying it repeatedly.
[00:27:21.571 --> 00:27:24.673]  We've got the book where he says exactly what Ron Paul said.
[00:27:24.673 --> 00:27:29.817]  The doctor, focused, with precisions, looking down at the quote and looks back up and he goes, okay, Herman.
[00:27:31.357 --> 00:27:39.322]  We're gonna get you just like we got Rick Perry, just like we're gonna get Mitt Romney and his fellow traveler, Chris.
[00:27:39.322 --> 00:27:43.404]  I love gun control and open borders and everything else, Christy.
[00:27:43.404 --> 00:27:45.806]  And I love austerity.
[00:27:45.806 --> 00:27:48.047]  Hey, he signed on to Mitt Romney.
[00:27:48.047 --> 00:27:50.608]  That means he's endorsing all of that.
[00:27:50.608 --> 00:27:53.990]  Gun control, open borders, carbon taxes, Obama healthcare.
[00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:58.853]  You mean to keep going on with Mitt Romney?
[00:27:58.853 --> 00:27:59.654]  The anointed one?
[00:28:01.701 --> 00:28:07.385]  Yeah, his big brokerage firm company used to be tied in, was pretty much the dominant owner of Clear Channel.
[00:28:07.385 --> 00:28:15.932]  It's not anymore, but that's why there's this vestigial groveling for him in talk radio land, because he's the former boss.
[00:28:15.932 --> 00:28:23.678]  I guess I could get down on my knees and lick Mitt Romney's boots and everybody want to put me on more radio stations, but I don't care.
[00:28:23.678 --> 00:28:31.084]  You know, I've talked about Fox News and different news articles making little jokes about me, saying Alex wants to work here, but we don't want him.
[00:28:32.222 --> 00:28:36.166]  So now when people call me up and say, we want you to come on Fox News as a guest, I have to tell them no.
[00:28:36.166 --> 00:28:44.553]  Including one of my friends, who I don't think is too happy over the fact that I've refused.
[00:28:44.553 --> 00:28:55.143]  But that's fine, because I have to separate myself from Babylon.
[00:28:55.143 --> 00:28:57.786]  They want you to think they're the only game in town, desperately.
[00:28:58.410 --> 00:29:00.131]  When they're a joke.
[00:29:00.131 --> 00:29:05.032]  They're a hollow, rotten pumpkin on the side of the road.
[00:29:05.032 --> 00:29:10.094]  A jack-o'-lantern, a burnout puppet.
[00:29:10.094 --> 00:29:13.276]  Now, the big news, by the way, that's coming up in the next hour.
[00:29:13.276 --> 00:29:17.277]  The big news.
[00:29:17.277 --> 00:29:19.518]  All ties together.
[00:29:19.518 --> 00:29:24.880]  ISSA has issued the subpoena to Holder in Fast and Furious Investigation.
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:27.701]  And I've got the subpoena here in my hot little hands, but that's not
[00:29:29.178 --> 00:29:30.999]  The issue.
[00:29:30.999 --> 00:29:37.600]  Two days ago when it came out they were going to issue this subpoena, a day later they made this announcement.
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:43.062]  Iran, working with Mexican drug cartels, was going to attack America.
[00:29:43.062 --> 00:29:47.683]  A purely manufactured smoke screen foreholder, and we called it.
[00:29:47.683 --> 00:29:49.904]  Stay with us.
[00:29:49.904 --> 00:29:51.284]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.284 --> 00:29:53.825]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.825 --> 00:29:56.486]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.656 --> 00:30:03.357]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:03.357 --> 00:30:08.662]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:30:08.662 --> 00:30:10.203]  Saving means to make money.
[00:30:10.203 --> 00:30:18.991]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:30:19.711 --> 00:30:27.255]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:30:27.255 --> 00:30:35.259]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.

[00:31:00.148 --> 00:31:04.691]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:31:04.691 --> 00:31:05.612]  Number 1.
[00:31:05.612 --> 00:31:09.035]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:31:09.035 --> 00:31:09.895]  Number 2.
[00:31:09.895 --> 00:31:14.779]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:31:14.779 --> 00:31:15.519]  It's true.
[00:31:15.519 --> 00:31:20.403]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:31:20.403 --> 00:31:21.224]  Number 3.
[00:31:21.224 --> 00:31:24.806]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:31:24.806 --> 00:31:28.509]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:31:28.709 --> 00:31:29.510]  Number 4.
[00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:32.272]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:31:32.272 --> 00:31:35.955]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:31:35.955 --> 00:31:36.735]  Number 5.
[00:31:36.735 --> 00:31:40.878]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:31:40.878 --> 00:31:45.642]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:31:56.749 --> 00:32:07.075]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:32:07.075 --> 00:32:12.218]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:32:12.218 --> 00:32:14.099]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[00:32:16.294 --> 00:32:20.941]  Well, they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:32:20.941 --> 00:32:24.167]  They soak pride in every stitch.
[00:32:24.167 --> 00:32:27.312]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[00:32:29.438 --> 00:32:34.020]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:39.101]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it, others don't.
[00:32:39.101 --> 00:32:41.242]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:32:41.242 --> 00:32:43.023]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:32:43.023 --> 00:32:45.904]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:32:45.904 --> 00:32:52.546]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:32:52.546 --> 00:32:55.247]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:32:55.247 --> 00:32:58.488]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it, others don't.
[00:33:05.091 --> 00:33:09.795]  Now Daddy didn't like trouble when he came along
[00:33:19.799 --> 00:33:42.454]  Everyone that knew him Knew each side that he'd be on He never was a hero For this town he shined like But you could always find him standing up For what he thought was right He'd say, you've got to stand for something Or you'll fall for anything
[00:33:44.316 --> 00:33:52.244]  There's only one of those men in this race.
[00:33:52.244 --> 00:33:54.486]  That's Ron Paul.
[00:33:54.486 --> 00:33:59.311]  You've got to stand for something.
[00:33:59.311 --> 00:34:05.698]  Like Herman Cain up there lying, saying he never said we don't need to audit the Fed.
[00:34:07.543 --> 00:34:10.864]  Or saying he didn't call people that wanted an audit stupid.
[00:34:10.864 --> 00:34:14.285]  No, you only wrote that in your book and we've got all these video and audio clips of you.
[00:34:14.285 --> 00:34:18.866]  We're going to be playing some of that next hour and on the nightly news tonight.
[00:34:18.866 --> 00:34:22.608]  That's how dumb Herman Cain thinks we are.
[00:34:22.608 --> 00:34:25.789]  You've got a guy who might as well be Al Gore.
[00:34:25.789 --> 00:34:29.010]  Mitt Romney is that big government.
[00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:33.811]  Anti-gun, socialist healthcare, carbon tax loving.
[00:34:33.811 --> 00:34:34.911]  Look it up!
[00:34:34.911 --> 00:34:36.152]  Chris Christie endorses him.
[00:34:37.045 --> 00:34:38.666]  That tells you all you know about that guy.
[00:34:38.666 --> 00:34:44.470]  Rick Perry, he's burning down right now.
[00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:48.232]  As his past comes out.
[00:34:48.232 --> 00:34:52.014]  Normally I don't even obsess over presidential elections because it's all puppets.
[00:34:52.014 --> 00:34:53.735]  But we've got a real guy.
[00:34:53.735 --> 00:34:55.376]  And he's an old man.
[00:34:55.376 --> 00:35:02.000]  He had an all cutesy cute for the ladies out there.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.122]  Like Mitt Romney or Herman Cain or somebody.
[00:35:05.623 --> 00:35:15.589]  But he's a real person who understood the real problems and has fought for 30 years against the Federal Reserve and now it's all coming down to the wire right now.
[00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:23.093]  We'll still beat this tyranny even if Ron Paul loses and he's won by getting in there and speaking out and being involved and still has a great chance.
[00:35:23.093 --> 00:35:27.456]  But the system is cramming Herman Cain and Mitt Romney down our throat for a reason.
[00:35:29.022 --> 00:35:31.125]  Because they work for the New World Order.
[00:35:31.125 --> 00:35:32.027]  Both of them.
[00:35:32.027 --> 00:35:35.853]  Look at the fruit of the tree of Ron Paul.
[00:35:35.853 --> 00:35:36.694]  Accurate.
[00:35:36.694 --> 00:35:37.435]  Steadfast.
[00:35:38.536 --> 00:35:39.697]  Sustaining.
[00:35:39.697 --> 00:35:40.918]  Liberty loving.
[00:35:40.918 --> 00:35:43.040]  Look at Herman Cain and Mitt Romney.
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:53.669]  Both high-level generals working directly for the New World Order and endorsing all of its collectivist enslavement systems.
[00:35:53.669 --> 00:35:55.931]  You know, a prisoner lives in a collectivist system.
[00:35:55.931 --> 00:35:57.452]  They want you locked down.
[00:35:57.452 --> 00:35:58.373]  That's coming up.
[00:35:58.373 --> 00:35:59.454]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:35:59.454 --> 00:35:59.494]  800-259-9231.
[00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:15.074]  I told you they would come up with some fake crisis to try to make Holder look like a hero as it came out that he shipped guns to Mexico and allowed cocaine to be shipped back in.
[00:36:15.074 --> 00:36:19.836]  That's in the El Paso Times, Chicago Tribune, other papers.
[00:36:19.836 --> 00:36:24.157]  But now US-Iran plotted with Mexican drug cartel to assassinate Saudi ambassador.
[00:36:24.157 --> 00:36:25.598]  Then you read there's no proof!
[00:36:26.684 --> 00:36:31.286]  But see, it's drug cartels and holders fighting drug cartels.
[00:36:31.286 --> 00:36:34.168]  This is meant to just... I thought he shipped guns to them.
[00:36:34.168 --> 00:36:35.428]  He's the one fighting them.
[00:36:35.428 --> 00:36:37.649]  No, it's the Iranians gave them the guns.
[00:36:37.649 --> 00:36:42.251]  It's just meant to kind of... This is all designed for people that are kind of halfway paying attention.
[00:36:42.251 --> 00:36:51.916]  Once you learn, like Goebbels and Hitler said, good propaganda is dumbed down, boiled down, very simplistic, for the lowest common denominator and those not paying attention.
[00:36:52.714 --> 00:36:54.455]  So, you're paying attention.
[00:36:54.455 --> 00:36:55.756]  This is like, what?
[00:36:55.756 --> 00:37:03.580]  They're admitting it wasn't a real plot, and drug cartels with the Iranians, and it's on the news, we ought to go ahead and just nuke Iran right now.
[00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:05.161]  I'm glad Israel's about to hit them.
[00:37:05.161 --> 00:37:07.483]  They wanted to blow up the Saudi embassy.
[00:37:07.483 --> 00:37:16.188]  Oh yeah, that's exactly what Iran would do, and then have a pretext for the West to come in and blow the daylights out of them.
[00:37:16.188 --> 00:37:17.829]  And again, I'm not saying Iran's great.
[00:37:17.829 --> 00:37:20.910]  The point is, this is all a setup.
[00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:21.471]  That's coming up.
[00:37:23.570 --> 00:37:48.644]  Going to Kurt Haskell, who's had a lot of courage, survived the underwear bombing almost two years ago now, two Christmases ago, saw the sharp-dressed man get the underwear bomber on the plane, a month and a half later, the Undersecretary of State admits, yes, an unnamed agency told them to help get him, you know, basically get him his visa and the rest of it and help get him on the plane, and then all of a sudden,
[00:37:49.787 --> 00:37:56.771]  The underwear bomber who said he had fired his lawyers and said he was gonna, you know, that he did it but he was not guilty and was gonna have a trial.
[00:37:56.771 --> 00:38:00.193]  Then he said, I'll call Kurt Haskell as my only witness.
[00:38:00.193 --> 00:38:03.795]  And I said I thought it was for leverage somehow, behind the scenes.
[00:38:06.692 --> 00:38:10.854]  Haskell asked me a few nights ago when he was on the TV show, InfoWars, not what I thought.
[00:38:10.854 --> 00:38:12.675]  I told him I think that's probably what's happening.
[00:38:12.675 --> 00:38:20.518]  He wouldn't tell me at the time what he thought was happening because he didn't want them to be able to use that against him as a witness to try to discredit his...
[00:38:22.475 --> 00:38:24.056]  His testimony somehow.
[00:38:24.056 --> 00:38:31.841]  But we'll now find out from Kurt Haskell, because I haven't talked to him yet today, and I appreciate him joining us on short notice, exactly what he thinks has happened here in this wild case.
[00:38:31.841 --> 00:38:33.042]  Now there won't be a trial.
[00:38:33.042 --> 00:38:35.304]  Now they'll be sentencing in early January.
[00:38:35.304 --> 00:38:39.726]  Here's the headline, Underwear Bomber Guilty Plea Shields Government Complicity.
[00:38:39.726 --> 00:38:43.509]  Reversal Means Identity of Well-Dressed Man Will Remain Unknown.
[00:38:43.509 --> 00:38:47.612]  Kurt Haskell joining us via video connection from Michigan.
[00:38:47.612 --> 00:38:49.193]  Kurt, what's your view on this, sir?
[00:38:50.083 --> 00:38:52.089]  Hey Alex, I'm not surprised at all.
[00:38:54.335 --> 00:39:00.516]  You know, just a couple days ago, Umar said in court that he's going to call me as his only witness.
[00:39:00.516 --> 00:39:08.678]  Obviously, the prosecution couldn't allow that to happen, so I would expect a very lenient sentence for Umar.
[00:39:08.678 --> 00:39:15.599]  I think the prosecution got in contact with him knowing that they did not want me to be on the stand.
[00:39:15.599 --> 00:39:18.060]  Umar gets a slap on the wrist, case goes away.
[00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:20.180]  So that's what I expect will happen here.
[00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:27.064]  So he's trusting them, and I don't think he can probably do that, but that is what you said on air.
[00:39:27.064 --> 00:39:28.445]  I said, what do you think is happening?
[00:39:28.445 --> 00:39:32.468]  You said, well, I want to get fully into it, but this could be a way to get a plea deal.
[00:39:32.468 --> 00:39:34.930]  Then we talked some off air.
[00:39:34.930 --> 00:39:40.374]  What was your view that you didn't want to share with myself or others until the outcome was known?
[00:39:42.096 --> 00:39:47.861]  Well, I just wasn't really sure, honestly, and I didn't want to speculate because I hadn't talked to Umar.
[00:39:47.861 --> 00:39:56.429]  So, you know, I expected that this was some sort of leverage he was using to get a lenient plea deal.
[00:39:56.429 --> 00:40:00.793]  They've had plea negotiations for 22 months now with no plea deal.
[00:40:00.793 --> 00:40:04.396]  And magically, as soon as he mentions my name, that I'll be testifying.
[00:40:05.237 --> 00:40:06.578]  Oh, now we have the plea deal.
[00:40:06.578 --> 00:40:08.819]  It's not a coincidence.
[00:40:08.819 --> 00:40:10.000]  That's the reason for the plea deal.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.943]  I expect, you know, a very... He gets sentenced in January, I think.
[00:40:13.943 --> 00:40:15.484]  I think I heard this morning.
[00:40:15.484 --> 00:40:18.265]  So, you know, pay attention to when he's sentenced.
[00:40:18.265 --> 00:40:23.609]  It'll probably be conscious shock in how leaning his punishment is, I would expect.
[00:40:24.437 --> 00:40:26.519]  And they'll be a right-wing spin.
[00:40:26.519 --> 00:40:30.482]  You know, they gave that bomber only 20 years in prison.
[00:40:30.482 --> 00:40:42.271]  Well, I tell you, he'll be living in there watching cable TV in a hot tub, this old bomber, when in truth, they're having to get him a lenient sentence because he was going to call you.
[00:40:42.271 --> 00:40:44.933]  And you're right, no plea deal in 22 months.
[00:40:44.933 --> 00:40:49.097]  But they mentioned Kurt Haskell and boom, there's a plea deal right away.
[00:40:50.154 --> 00:40:52.154]  Yeah, it's not surprising at all.
[00:40:52.154 --> 00:41:06.058]  Actually, I was in court this morning on one of my own cases and I was talking with a couple of people that were down there and as we were talking about this I said, you know, I expect a plea deal and that I won't actually take the stand.
[00:41:06.058 --> 00:41:08.158]  I get a text that, boom, there's a plea deal.
[00:41:08.158 --> 00:41:10.438]  So it's kind of, you know, expected.
[00:41:10.438 --> 00:41:12.479]  I was actually talking about it when I got notice of it.
[00:41:14.231 --> 00:41:19.195]  Well, you've got to write a book, so this is a testimony on record.
[00:41:19.195 --> 00:41:20.616]  Where do you go from here, Kurt?
[00:41:20.616 --> 00:41:23.578]  I mean, you could have been killed, you and your wife.
[00:41:23.578 --> 00:41:24.758]  You've tried to get justice.
[00:41:24.758 --> 00:41:31.663]  You said you were probably waiting in the past before you filed a civil suit to see what happened with the trial.
[00:41:31.663 --> 00:41:36.126]  Now we see where this is going and what you've got up until Christmas Day to file the suit.
[00:41:38.246 --> 00:41:39.487]  Is that coming?
[00:41:39.487 --> 00:41:41.208]  It's coming, yeah.
[00:41:41.208 --> 00:41:41.848]  It's coming soon.
[00:41:41.848 --> 00:41:51.735]  I wanted to see how this played out before I decided, so I'm going to file a civil case, so stay tuned for round two of hearings on this civil case.
[00:41:51.735 --> 00:41:53.336]  Oh, is this breaking news here?
[00:41:53.336 --> 00:41:58.219]  Kurt Haskell will file under his civil case by Christmas.
[00:41:58.219 --> 00:41:59.640]  I will, yeah.
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:00.080]  Stay tuned.
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:01.121]  I just have to write it up.
[00:42:02.970 --> 00:42:14.945]  Yeah, you know, I'm going to consult with an attorney friend I have that's a civil attorney and I don't know if I'm going to file it with help of him or if he's going to take it and file it on behalf of me.
[00:42:14.945 --> 00:42:17.689]  It's not decided yet, but it'll be filed soon.
[00:42:18.690 --> 00:42:20.190]  Well, you certainly got standing.
[00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:22.211]  You're a victim.
[00:42:22.211 --> 00:42:23.952]  And you witnessed all this.
[00:42:23.952 --> 00:42:27.713]  And the government, obviously, from what you saw, they helped get him on the plane.
[00:42:27.713 --> 00:42:38.896]  That right there is a bare minimum that you've got a serious negligence, willful, conscious... It's not even... It's complicity, but you could probably win better.
[00:42:38.896 --> 00:42:41.636]  I'm not an expert lawyer like you are, but I study this stuff.
[00:42:41.636 --> 00:42:46.998]  There's a whole... I mean, just ballpark right now, what are you looking at as different strategies?
[00:42:49.344 --> 00:42:54.068]  Uh, I'm going to file a section 4- I believe it's, uh, 1983.
[00:42:54.068 --> 00:42:58.251]  42-1983 is the, uh, law I'm going to file under.
[00:42:58.251 --> 00:43:03.396]  It's for an intentional violation of your constitutional rights, so that would be the section I go under.
[00:43:05.138 --> 00:43:10.222]  And is that putting you in danger in their sting operation knowingly?
[00:43:10.222 --> 00:43:20.971]  I mean, because if the cops did a sting at a roller rink with a bunch of little kids, you know, if the cops said, meet me here, I'm going to sell you cocaine at the roller rink, and there's a shootout and kids get shot, they're definitely culpable.
[00:43:20.971 --> 00:43:21.651]  Is that what you're saying?
[00:43:22.472 --> 00:43:29.153]  No, what I'm saying is the government intentionally caused me emotional distress, and that will be what my argument is.
[00:43:29.153 --> 00:43:32.574]  But they also almost killed you by helping him get on the plane.
[00:43:32.574 --> 00:43:32.874]  Right.
[00:43:32.874 --> 00:43:44.677]  And under that law, I can also ask for punitive damages, which are damages I didn't necessarily incur, but are damages designed to punish the person or entity that caused this problem.
[00:43:44.677 --> 00:43:51.078]  So obviously I'll be asking for a significant amount of punitive damages, probably eight figures is what I'm thinking.
[00:43:52.165 --> 00:43:59.873]  But of course, the real goal here, I would imagine, is to make sure others aren't hurt in the future by these staged operations.
[00:43:59.873 --> 00:44:03.136]  But also, you'll be able to ferret out quite a bit of truth in your lawsuit.
[00:44:04.525 --> 00:44:05.045]  Exactly.
[00:44:05.045 --> 00:44:07.766]  We still haven't gotten to the bottom of all the details.
[00:44:07.766 --> 00:44:09.707]  Laurie and I haven't.
[00:44:09.707 --> 00:44:12.568]  We want the government to admit what they did.
[00:44:12.568 --> 00:44:14.989]  They're still hiding the fact of what they did.
[00:44:14.989 --> 00:44:16.530]  We want them to admit it.
[00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:19.551]  We want to have our reputations cleared.
[00:44:19.551 --> 00:44:21.812]  They've been smeared by the government over the past 22 months.
[00:44:23.513 --> 00:44:25.355]  We want the government to admit what they did.
[00:44:25.355 --> 00:44:30.239]  Obviously, you know, that's what we're going to be seeking, as well as damages.
[00:44:30.239 --> 00:44:44.210]  Wow, you'll be able to call the Undersecretary of State, Kennedy, who in testimony said they were ordered to help him get on the plane, then if he lies or declares national security, wow, this is going to get really wild.
[00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:44.871]  Well, we'll see.
[00:44:44.871 --> 00:44:45.472]  I don't know.
[00:44:48.889 --> 00:44:53.171]  You know, they could declare national security and throw my case out too, so who knows?
[00:44:53.171 --> 00:44:53.651]  I don't know.
[00:44:53.651 --> 00:44:55.592]  We'll see where it goes.
[00:44:55.592 --> 00:44:58.113]  But regardless, national security is called.
[00:44:58.113 --> 00:44:59.833]  Still, your life was endangered.
[00:44:59.833 --> 00:45:01.274]  I mean, I just go to the common law.
[00:45:01.274 --> 00:45:04.655]  I'm not a lawyer, but I've studied basic common law, basic common sense.
[00:45:04.655 --> 00:45:06.016]  If you go back to the law, it's all there.
[00:45:06.016 --> 00:45:08.817]  I mean, they helped get this guy on the plane.
[00:45:08.817 --> 00:45:10.318]  That's been confirmed.
[00:45:10.318 --> 00:45:13.179]  It could have killed you and all those other people.
[00:45:13.179 --> 00:45:15.680]  I hope others file lawsuits as well, not just you.
[00:45:16.792 --> 00:45:24.255]  Yeah, you know, hopefully some passengers will come out of the woodwork and support us in maybe joining the lawsuit, too.
[00:45:24.255 --> 00:45:32.598]  Nobody's stepped forward yet, but of course, you know, that would be helpful if we had a significant amount of passengers joining the case instead of just lorrying on.
[00:45:35.154 --> 00:45:36.755]  Well, thank God you spoke out.
[00:45:36.755 --> 00:45:39.476]  Thank God you were there.
[00:45:39.476 --> 00:45:43.677]  I mean, it's scary and dangerous, but that's the silver lining.
[00:45:43.677 --> 00:45:46.078]  Or we would have never known any of this.
[00:45:46.078 --> 00:45:51.280]  We could have suspected the classic staged event.
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:46:00.544]  But now we're hearing Iran with Mexican drug cartels, and they admit no proof of this, was going to try to blow up the Saudi embassy in the U.S.
[00:46:00.544 --> 00:46:03.225]  And then there's no proof, but oh, that's a good distraction for Holder.
[00:46:04.201 --> 00:46:07.002]  And it just happens to involve Mexican drug cartels.
[00:46:07.002 --> 00:46:11.344]  Drug cartels he admittedly ordered guns to be shipped to, and he's been caught perjuring himself.
[00:46:11.344 --> 00:46:18.607]  I mean, I know this just came out, Kurt, but what's your view on all these latest announcements that U.S.
[00:46:18.607 --> 00:46:23.869]  says Iran plotted with Mexican drug cartel to assassinate Saudi ambassador?
[00:46:24.966 --> 00:46:26.988]  Boy, I honestly have no idea.
[00:46:26.988 --> 00:46:28.409]  I haven't read anything on that yet.
[00:46:28.409 --> 00:46:37.397]  I've been so busy this week with everything going on with this Underwear Bomber case and my own cases and Tigers in the playoffs that I've been going to.
[00:46:37.397 --> 00:46:39.900]  So I don't know that I can even comment on that.
[00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:41.161]  I want to read into it a little bit.
[00:46:41.667 --> 00:46:47.033]  There's also a Suffolk County report just came out linking and testimony Hillary Clinton to the gun walker.
[00:46:47.033 --> 00:46:49.255]  Of course it's a Clinton project.
[00:46:49.255 --> 00:46:55.341]  Ordering that, of course, her former minion, Deputy Secretary of State, Deputy Secretary of
[00:46:57.298 --> 00:46:57.418]  Well,
[00:47:19.594 --> 00:47:27.137]  You know, it's been really fascinating to go through this, to see how all these things really play out.
[00:47:27.137 --> 00:47:36.680]  You know, I had no idea how things really worked before I was kind of thrown into this underwear bomber case, not of my own doing.
[00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:45.483]  And it's been really fascinating to me to see how it all plays out with a predictable ending, of course, that I never actually get to take the stand, which I expected.
[00:47:47.136 --> 00:47:48.557]  In some ways, I'm kind of relieved.
[00:47:48.557 --> 00:47:52.660]  I was actually considering hiring a full-time bodyguard.
[00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:58.744]  That was something I was probably going to do within the next week, you know, to protect me.
[00:47:58.744 --> 00:48:04.848]  Since I got announced as being the sole witness last week, I really started to be more concerned with my safety.
[00:48:04.848 --> 00:48:07.290]  So, in that regard, I'm kind of glad it's over.
[00:48:07.290 --> 00:48:14.295]  I'm kind of upset, though, that I won't be able to take the stand and blow this case wide open, but I can still file a civil case.
[00:48:16.576 --> 00:48:29.226]  You know, I can still get some more truth out of this and actually be in charge of the case myself, sending subpoenas, asking the questions I want to ask and depositions and that sort of thing.
[00:48:29.226 --> 00:48:32.449]  So maybe that will actually be better for getting to the bottom of this.
[00:48:33.610 --> 00:48:35.972]  You know, other than that, you know, I don't know.
[00:48:35.972 --> 00:48:39.296]  I expect the suns will be very light.
[00:48:39.296 --> 00:48:43.780]  Probably conscious, shocking how light it will be is what I expect.
[00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:47.223]  And, you know, it's beyond my control besides that.
[00:48:48.174 --> 00:48:50.915]  Well, you've already risked your life in more ways than one.
[00:48:50.915 --> 00:49:01.080]  People are praying for you, and we appreciate you having the courage to even go that extra mile and say that you're going to do the civil suit to try to get justice.
[00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:07.923]  And justice be done, may the heavens fall, even if it does bring down the State Department and the Justice Department.
[00:49:07.923 --> 00:49:09.884]  In closing, I just want to bring this point up.
[00:49:09.884 --> 00:49:15.467]  You notice in the, quote, extrajudicial killing of Ammar al-Awlaki, the guy that secretly hangs out at the Pentagon,
[00:49:16.227 --> 00:49:18.869]  Ran the underwear bomber and all these other guys.
[00:49:18.869 --> 00:49:20.431]  They never want trials now.
[00:49:20.431 --> 00:49:22.593]  They just want to say, we're killing somebody.
[00:49:22.593 --> 00:49:26.636]  But this is why you want trials, is so that the facts can be heard.
[00:49:26.636 --> 00:49:34.002]  When you have torture, when you have secret killings, secret arrests, historically you can't believe a word that comes out of those governments.
[00:49:34.002 --> 00:49:37.565]  Whether it's the Soviets, or the North Koreans, or the Nazis.
[00:49:37.565 --> 00:49:39.827]  I mean, this is really common sense.
[00:49:39.827 --> 00:49:44.091]  And it's just an example of why we do need trials, so the facts can be seen.
[00:49:46.028 --> 00:49:47.529]  You're exactly right.
[00:49:47.529 --> 00:49:56.314]  You know, once you start going down that path, then, you know, who's to watch over these people and make sure, you know, that they're actually guilty?
[00:49:56.314 --> 00:49:58.455]  Anwar al-Awlaki is killed without a trial.
[00:49:58.455 --> 00:50:00.096]  He's an American citizen.
[00:50:00.096 --> 00:50:04.378]  You have a right to a trial before you're executed?
[00:50:04.378 --> 00:50:05.439]  It's ridiculous.
[00:50:05.439 --> 00:50:10.321]  He's denied his right to an attorney, denied his right to a fair trial.
[00:50:10.321 --> 00:50:11.562]  It's totally illegal.
[00:50:11.562 --> 00:50:13.303]  So, you know, if they can do that,
[00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:15.721]  What can't they do?
[00:50:15.721 --> 00:50:19.686]  You know, it's really problematic to me to see these things going on.
[00:50:19.686 --> 00:50:24.432]  It's as if the government just doesn't care about the Constitution or anybody's rights at all.
[00:50:24.432 --> 00:50:27.175]  You know, whether they're actually criminal or not, which
[00:50:28.254 --> 00:50:29.835]  You know, has yet to be determined.
[00:50:29.835 --> 00:50:34.677]  Just because the government says someone is a terrorist or a criminal doesn't necessarily mean that they are.
[00:50:34.677 --> 00:50:36.918]  Maybe they're lying for some other purpose.
[00:50:36.918 --> 00:50:39.200]  Maybe their wife's being threatened.
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:40.340]  Maybe their family is.
[00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:41.941]  Maybe they've been set up.
[00:50:41.941 --> 00:50:51.166]  I mean, this has come out over and over again with McVeigh, Lee Harvey Oswald, you know, the gentleman that shot Martin Luther King.
[00:50:51.886 --> 00:50:54.447]  I mean, the evidence is there of how they set these things up.
[00:50:54.447 --> 00:50:58.729]  We have Operation Northwoods Declassified, where the Pentagon talks about how to bomb D.C.
[00:50:58.729 --> 00:51:01.930]  and even how to frame, even how to frame patsies.
[00:51:01.930 --> 00:51:05.011]  But I've heard good old boys all over talk radio.
[00:51:05.011 --> 00:51:13.735]  I've, well, yesterday, Drudge linked to a article by Ron Paul that we post from his congressional site.
[00:51:15.319 --> 00:51:21.363]  On Infowars.com, and it was Ron Paul saying, what other Americans are on the secret kill list?
[00:51:21.363 --> 00:51:31.709]  And normally about 90% of comments are positive, but about half of them were, Ron Paul's a traitor, Alex Jones is a traitor, how dare you not want to kill citizens that we know are terrorists.
[00:51:31.709 --> 00:51:39.014]  And just the mindlessness of, we gotta get these terrorists, and people just willingly wanting to give up the shield of liberty.
[00:51:40.117 --> 00:51:47.145]  And now all across the board, we see just incredible excesses of government corruption caught framing people.
[00:51:47.145 --> 00:51:51.390]  Turns out more than a third of folks with DNA evidence on death row were innocent.
[00:51:51.390 --> 00:51:56.376]  And it turns out the state, in case after case, they had one just up and came out in the death row thing on a round rock.
[00:51:57.057 --> 00:52:07.820]  North of Austin, where they knew he was innocent for 20 years and we're trying to still make sure he was put to death and we're going and fighting his appeals, knowing he didn't do it.
[00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:11.341]  I mean, some of these prosecutors are some of the most soulless people.
[00:52:11.341 --> 00:52:20.964]  There's got to be a special place in hell, Kurt Haskell, reserved for people who know the truth and are willing to put innocent people in jail.
[00:52:20.964 --> 00:52:23.444]  And then they try to sell to the public that it's tough guy.
[00:52:23.444 --> 00:52:25.385]  And our founders were tough guys.
[00:52:26.311 --> 00:52:31.675]  The French and Indian War, all of it, fighting the British, biggest military on earth at the time, never been beaten.
[00:52:31.675 --> 00:52:35.277]  They were tough guys, and they put these things in place.
[00:52:35.277 --> 00:52:39.580]  Okay, having liberty and freedom and checks and balances is not wimpy.
[00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:43.403]  As a lawyer, what's your view on that final statement, Kurt Haskell?
[00:52:46.748 --> 00:52:58.361]  We've gone from a government for the people by the people to a government that now controls the people, where the government tells us what's going to happen.
[00:52:58.361 --> 00:53:03.307]  I don't know how it's gone that way, but it's almost as if we're losing all of our rights.
[00:53:07.744 --> 00:53:09.205]  Nazi Germany Part 2?
[00:53:09.205 --> 00:53:09.565]  I don't know.
[00:53:09.565 --> 00:53:11.086]  Maybe that would be a good comparison.
[00:53:11.086 --> 00:53:18.671]  The parallels are pretty similar if you look at Germany in the 1930s to what's going on in the United States in 2011.
[00:53:18.671 --> 00:53:21.553]  I think it's pretty similar.
[00:53:21.553 --> 00:53:23.114]  But you're right.
[00:53:23.114 --> 00:53:29.398]  It's almost as if we have no rights and we have a good segment of the population okay with that.
[00:53:29.398 --> 00:53:30.379]  It pays no attention.
[00:53:31.587 --> 00:53:40.289]  Sits back and watches their TV and watches American Idol and plays video games and doesn't pay any attention to what's really going on.
[00:53:40.289 --> 00:53:43.090]  Which is easy to do.
[00:53:43.090 --> 00:53:51.412]  If you just look at the headlines of stories and don't think about them and look into them, maybe that's what you would think.
[00:53:51.412 --> 00:53:53.132]  It relies on the media and the government.
[00:53:53.132 --> 00:53:54.972]  I don't know.
[00:53:54.972 --> 00:53:57.373]  The country is in a sad state right now.
[00:53:58.220 --> 00:54:22.118]  Well, if you watch old TV shows, even fiction or non-fiction like Twilight Zone or whatever it is, so many of them were based in futuristic, you know, police state, authoritarian systems where there's secret arrests, secret torture, extrajudicial executions, and it's always shown in what the old America was as incredibly dangerous and horrible and the opposite of freedom, which it is.
[00:54:22.118 --> 00:54:27.783]  But nowadays you watch these shows, like 24 and Others, and man, it is cool to torture people, including their children.
[00:54:28.283 --> 00:54:30.286]  Man, it is fun to frame people!
[00:54:30.286 --> 00:54:32.128]  It is really great!
[00:54:32.128 --> 00:54:37.616]  And it just shows how the establishment is trying to give us their evil, corrupt mindset.
[00:54:37.616 --> 00:54:41.721]  It shows how America, to a great extent, has lost its soul.
[00:54:41.721 --> 00:54:45.246]  Kurt Askel, what's the best website for people to visit?
[00:54:47.994 --> 00:54:49.755]  Uh, for my story?
[00:54:49.755 --> 00:54:50.776]  Yes, yes.
[00:54:50.776 --> 00:55:03.465]  You can always go on my blog, HaskellFamily.blogspot.com, which I've posted articles on going all the way back to Christmas Day 09, which was the day of the attack on the underwear bomber.
[00:55:03.465 --> 00:55:10.490]  Yeah, the full saga is there at the HaskellFamily.blogspot.com.
[00:55:11.434 --> 00:55:11.974]  Right.
[00:55:11.974 --> 00:55:13.075]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:55:13.075 --> 00:55:19.059]  And of course, I'll be putting updates as I file a civil case and things go on with that case, too.
[00:55:19.059 --> 00:55:21.140]  So it may not be anything right away.
[00:55:21.140 --> 00:55:26.003]  It's something I'm working on, though, and I'll be starting before Christmas time anyway.
[00:55:26.003 --> 00:55:30.907]  Well, Kurt, thank you for your courage again, and thank you for breaking the news that the civil suit will go forward.
[00:55:30.907 --> 00:55:32.488]  That is certainly newsworthy.
[00:55:32.488 --> 00:55:34.449]  Kurt Haskell, thank you so much.
[00:55:34.449 --> 00:55:34.749]  Thanks.
[00:55:34.749 --> 00:55:36.450]  No problem, Alex.
[00:55:36.450 --> 00:55:40.433]  Well, we appreciate him giving us that time today.
[00:55:41.975 --> 00:55:45.816]  And he certainly now, I think, needs to take a few days off and relax a bit.
[00:55:45.816 --> 00:55:47.997]  He's earned it before he gets back in the battle.
[00:55:47.997 --> 00:55:53.599]  We skipped that network break because that news was so hardcore and breaking here.
[00:55:53.599 --> 00:55:56.560]  Great job of the crew getting him on such short notice.
[00:55:56.560 --> 00:55:58.241]  I'm going to give you the number right now.
[00:55:58.241 --> 00:55:58.421]  It's 800-259-9231.
[00:55:58.421 --> 00:55:58.481]  800-259-9231.
[00:55:58.481 --> 00:56:01.902]  On any of the subjects I've raised, the lies of Herman Cain saying he never said don't audit the Fed.
[00:56:01.902 --> 00:56:02.922]  Caught red-handed.
[00:56:02.922 --> 00:56:03.522]  That's coming up.
[00:56:12.186 --> 00:56:17.611]  Hillary, now it comes out, I'm going to get more into this, is behind the Fast and Furious.
[00:56:17.611 --> 00:56:19.753]  Gee, that's really a shocker.
[00:56:19.753 --> 00:56:25.258]  Clintonistas, that's their specialty is false flags to blame the Second Amendment.
[00:56:25.258 --> 00:56:28.701]  We've got a bunch of news on carbon taxes.
[00:56:28.701 --> 00:56:29.882]  We've got Occupy L.A.
[00:56:29.882 --> 00:56:32.225]  speaker saying violence will be necessary.
[00:56:33.936 --> 00:56:36.178]  And I bet you a million bucks this guy's anti-gun.
[00:56:36.178 --> 00:56:38.639]  They want your guns so they can have their way with you.
[00:56:38.639 --> 00:56:39.780]  Don't ever forget that.
[00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:41.361]  He's a collectivist.
[00:56:41.361 --> 00:56:42.822]  That's all coming up.
[00:56:42.822 --> 00:56:45.264]  Superhero gets arrested for breaking up a fight.
[00:56:45.264 --> 00:56:47.125]  The cops are the only cops around to do that.
[00:56:47.125 --> 00:56:48.646]  You ever heard of a citizen's arrest?
[00:56:48.646 --> 00:56:51.348]  I think it's stupid to be dressed up in a superhero outfit.
[00:56:51.348 --> 00:56:53.909]  Well, it kind of sells the idea of citizens taking action.
[00:56:53.909 --> 00:56:57.912]  Cops arrest people under citizens' arrest powers.
[00:56:57.912 --> 00:57:03.516]  Then, under your incorporated system, you hire them to carry out the job of special training and equipment.
[00:57:04.317 --> 00:57:09.284]  So that's just more of the state trying to teach you that you don't have a right to defend yourself.
[00:57:09.284 --> 00:57:10.426]  Or a right to intervene.
[00:57:10.426 --> 00:57:13.611]  You don't just have a right, you have a duty under common law.
[00:57:13.611 --> 00:57:16.455]  And almost every state has laws compelling you!
[00:57:17.315 --> 00:57:26.638]  If you see somebody beating somebody's brains out for no reason, or you see somebody setting fire to a house, you've got a responsibility to restrain them.
[00:57:26.638 --> 00:57:34.900]  And in the continuum of force, if they resist you and continue to try to endanger lives, you have a responsibility to kill them, just as the police do!
[00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:40.601]  I know the common law, and so don't give me that bull that you can't defend yourself.
[00:57:40.601 --> 00:57:42.182]  Or stop crimes in their commission.
[00:57:43.035 --> 00:57:44.156]  You ever heard of the Good Samaritan Law?
[00:57:44.156 --> 00:57:53.045]  You see a car wreck, somebody's bleeding to death, they need help, you drive past, but when people aren't helping them, you are aiding and abetting, and that's manslaughter.
[00:57:53.045 --> 00:57:54.507]  Alright, now I'm ranting.
[00:57:56.926 --> 00:57:57.606]  Makes me sick.
[00:57:57.606 --> 00:58:00.048]  People perish for lack of knowledge.
[00:58:00.048 --> 00:58:00.868]  We're going to break here.
[00:58:00.868 --> 00:58:02.589]  I want to tell you about PureWaterFreedom.com.
[00:58:02.589 --> 00:58:04.330]  They have a whole line of household filters.
[00:58:04.330 --> 00:58:07.732]  They remove fluoride from other toxins from every water source in your home.
[00:58:07.732 --> 00:58:09.653]  They got tabletops under the sink, handheld.
[00:58:09.653 --> 00:58:10.573]  They got it all.
[00:58:10.573 --> 00:58:11.834]  Shower systems.
[00:58:11.834 --> 00:58:13.695]  PureWaterFreedom.com.
[00:58:13.695 --> 00:58:15.776]  PureWaterFreedom.com.
[00:58:15.776 --> 00:58:19.238]  Imagine being able to turn your tap water into safe, clean drinking bathing water.
[00:58:20.435 --> 00:58:22.156]  How about a fluoride-free shower?
[00:58:22.156 --> 00:58:24.977]  Purewaterfreedom.com, check them out today.

[00:58:43.507 --> 00:58:47.249]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:52.330 --> 00:58:54.893]  And you're subject to other police action.
[00:58:54.893 --> 00:58:56.154]  Tyranny is here.
[00:58:56.154 --> 00:59:00.038]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:59:00.038 --> 00:59:02.340]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:08.206]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:59:08.206 --> 00:59:14.433]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:59:14.853 --> 00:59:20.838]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:59:20.838 --> 00:59:25.002]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:59:25.002 --> 00:59:29.306]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:59:29.306 --> 00:59:35.251]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:59:35.251 --> 00:59:38.814]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:59:38.814 --> 00:59:40.795]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:59:40.795 --> 00:59:41.216]  It's here.

[00:59:53.627 --> 00:59:56.009]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.009 --> 00:59:58.792]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.373 --> 01:00:10.175]  Well, Herman Cain has been caught in a big, fat, gigantic lie.
[01:00:34.301 --> 01:00:36.262]  That's coming up.
[01:00:36.262 --> 01:00:38.504]  Australia's in the process of committing suicide.
[01:00:38.504 --> 01:00:40.185]  That's what James Dillingpole says.
[01:00:40.185 --> 01:00:43.408]  He's coming up for one segment, the next segment.
[01:00:43.408 --> 01:00:48.592]  I've got the big breaking news here today on Fast and Furious.
[01:00:48.592 --> 01:00:53.015]  And now it ties in with this fake Iran plot.
[01:00:53.015 --> 01:00:55.176]  That of course involves Mexican drug cartels.
[01:00:55.176 --> 01:00:57.738]  So Holder can look like he's fighting Mexican drug cartels.
[01:00:57.738 --> 01:00:59.299]  This is right out of Central Casting.
[01:00:59.299 --> 01:01:00.360]  We predicted it.
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:01.121]  Not hard to predict.
[01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:07.222]  We're going to tear apart the 999 plan, which has got VAT, sales taxes, everything in it.
[01:01:07.222 --> 01:01:10.864]  I mean, talk about globalist dream.
[01:01:10.864 --> 01:01:13.905]  What do you expect from a Federal Reserve operative?
[01:01:13.905 --> 01:01:16.706]  The Federal Reserve got the income tax in 1913.
[01:01:16.706 --> 01:01:17.607]  Now they want more.
[01:01:17.607 --> 01:01:18.927]  They're going to get it.
[01:01:18.927 --> 01:01:21.288]  Because it's so much fun to be conned by Herman Cain.
[01:01:21.288 --> 01:01:23.809]  Unless we wake up.
[01:01:23.809 --> 01:01:27.411]  Then they got Tiddlywinks, Tinkerbell, whatever his name is, Romney.
[01:01:28.308 --> 01:01:42.111]  Running around endorsed by Baron Harkinen, Jabba the Hutt, or whatever his name is, Chris Plumper, and then when he got, I shouldn't joke, I'm a little overweight myself, the point is they're saying, because he's fat, people like him, because he doesn't look presidential.
[01:01:42.111 --> 01:01:49.972]  Herman Cain's black, so he might do, it's what you stand for, not how much you weigh, or what color you are.
[01:01:49.972 --> 01:01:54.373]  I know Ron Paul is in, you know, in good shape, but he's an older guy.
[01:01:55.390 --> 01:01:56.611]  Hey Alex, thanks for having me on again.
[01:01:56.611 --> 01:01:57.612]  I wanted to
[01:02:23.069 --> 01:02:26.847]  Talk about, I don't know if you're taking calls on this right now, but the Occupy
[01:02:27.903 --> 01:02:33.789]  Uh, Durham, Occupy in North Carolina, my experience, and then also recommend someone for you to interview.
[01:02:33.789 --> 01:02:38.373]  Yeah, I mean, there's no doubt now the entire Democratic Party has endorsed Occupy Wall Street.
[01:02:38.373 --> 01:02:46.040]  It's got some good people in it, but it is led by collectivists that want to just take money from the rich instead of get rid of the corrupt Federal Reserve.
[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:50.284]  So, it's basically a bunch of Bolsheviks if they have their way.
[01:02:50.284 --> 01:02:53.687]  What's your experience with the Occupy Raleigh up there?
[01:02:54.724 --> 01:02:56.906]  Well, I went to the Durham one.
[01:02:56.906 --> 01:03:02.792]  I don't know the Raleigh one, but in Durham it was actually run really well.
[01:03:02.792 --> 01:03:03.813]  It was open-ended.
[01:03:03.813 --> 01:03:05.956]  It was based on consensus.
[01:03:05.956 --> 01:03:12.803]  They split off into committees, and even the organizers, when they split off into committees, they said,
[01:03:13.396 --> 01:03:18.180]  You know, we're not here to push a certain view or any particular angle.
[01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:19.982]  Yeah, but what did they come up with afterwards?
[01:03:19.982 --> 01:03:31.051]  Because if they know predominantly it's mainly a bunch of union people that show up, then they're going to get their collectivist Obama system that Wall Street wants to make people dependent through.
[01:03:32.335 --> 01:03:36.156]  Well, they haven't made any specific demands or proposals yet.
[01:03:36.156 --> 01:03:38.996]  We're still meeting and organizing.
[01:03:38.996 --> 01:03:48.778]  I'm just trying to make sure that I'm there and that I am at least a single voice talking about the Federal Reserve and trying to identify the actual problem.
[01:03:48.778 --> 01:03:56.000]  It seems like a lot of them, you know, realize that there's an issue, but they're having trouble actually pinpointing it.
[01:03:57.113 --> 01:04:04.437]  Well, I'm glad you found some nice folks, because all I've run into... Well, Houston, they were pretty nice, but they had a lot of in-the-Fed signs.
[01:04:04.437 --> 01:04:10.621]  What I've mainly run into is, don't bring your Ron Paul signs here, we just want to get the rich people.
[01:04:10.621 --> 01:04:19.146]  And I'm trying to explain, the ultra-rich use government to control, and to get your tax money, and to shut down their competition.
[01:04:19.146 --> 01:04:23.709]  What the general public thinks of as rich is somebody driving a new car and living in a big house.
[01:04:23.709 --> 01:04:25.290]  Those are the people that create jobs.
[01:04:26.010 --> 01:04:34.337]  You know, some middle class person that makes $100,000, $300,000, $1,000,000 a year, that's what drives the economy, more than anything.
[01:04:34.337 --> 01:04:35.577]  Those consumers.
[01:04:35.577 --> 01:04:38.720]  Because we're a consumer society, we don't have industry.
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:42.183]  But interesting, that's interesting to get your story on that.
[01:04:42.183 --> 01:04:43.604]  Thank you so much.
[01:04:43.604 --> 01:04:50.149]  Aaron, Don, Vincent, and Scott and others, your calls are coming up after
[01:04:51.664 --> 01:04:56.047]  I talked to James Dillingpole briefly, the one in Telegraph, Telegraph.
[01:04:56.047 --> 01:04:58.409]  And then we're gonna get into Herman Cain, a lot more, stay with us.
[01:05:00.805 --> 01:05:03.328]  You can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.
[01:05:03.328 --> 01:05:15.620]  Alex has told you about the amazing, great-tasting, long-term, storable food from eFoodsDirect, and how a food savings account is your best insurance against natural disasters, job loss, and high food costs.
[01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:22.787]  But did you know that this dehydrated food also protects you against foodborne contaminants like E. coli and Salmonella?
[01:05:22.987 --> 01:05:27.090]  Those poisonous critters can't live in low-moisture food from eFoodsDirect.
[01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:29.452]  Ask for the Alex Fall Special.
[01:05:29.452 --> 01:05:34.476]  The Fall Special is a 24-day supply of food in a convenient, portable container.

[01:05:47.967 --> 01:05:50.809]  And go to efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.

[01:05:57.632 --> 01:06:00.734]  You can bet your life on efoodsdirect.
[01:06:00.734 --> 01:06:01.914]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:06:01.914 --> 01:06:08.038]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:06:08.818 --> 01:06:11.381]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:06:11.381 --> 01:06:16.766]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:06:16.766 --> 01:06:19.809]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:06:19.809 --> 01:06:22.132]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:06:22.132 --> 01:06:25.455]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac.
[01:06:25.655 --> 01:06:28.356]  And America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:06:28.356 --> 01:06:31.737]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:06:31.737 --> 01:06:37.519]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:06:37.519 --> 01:06:39.159]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:06:39.159 --> 01:06:40.460]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:06:40.460 --> 01:06:43.141]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:06:43.141 --> 01:06:47.362]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:06:47.362 --> 01:06:49.943]  You can find the video at www.barron.com.
[01:06:50.143 --> 01:06:51.967]  End of America 3.com.
[01:06:51.967 --> 01:06:54.552]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[01:06:54.552 --> 01:06:58.440]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.

[01:07:01.693 --> 01:07:06.378]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[01:07:06.378 --> 01:07:12.824]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[01:07:12.824 --> 01:07:15.106]  Number one, study the past.
[01:07:15.106 --> 01:07:17.489]  History really does repeat itself.
[01:07:17.489 --> 01:07:21.212]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[01:07:22.341 --> 01:07:25.422]  Number three, take decisive action.
[01:07:25.422 --> 01:07:29.263]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[01:07:29.263 --> 01:07:34.304]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[01:07:34.304 --> 01:07:38.305]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[01:07:38.305 --> 01:07:41.726]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[01:07:41.726 --> 01:07:45.367]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:07:46.207 --> 01:07:51.149]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[01:07:51.149 --> 01:07:55.770]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:07:55.770 --> 01:08:02.272]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:08:02.272 --> 01:08:08.914]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.914 --> 01:08:11.895]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:31.181 --> 01:08:34.345]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:34.345 --> 01:08:38.290]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:08:38.290 --> 01:08:42.475]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, U.S.
[01:08:42.475 --> 01:08:47.262]  says Iran plotted with Mexican drug cartel to assassinate Saudi ambassador.
[01:08:47.722 --> 01:09:05.103]  Now, the Attorney General has now been subpoenaed, and he knew yesterday when they put out this new plot that he was about to be subpoenaed, so now people vaguely paying attention just hear that Iran was going to arm Mexico and try to blow up embassies and kill people.
[01:09:06.876 --> 01:09:12.962]  And so now people just kind of foggily are hearing, oh, Iran was involved.
[01:09:12.962 --> 01:09:20.090]  Oh, holders fighting drug cartels, not giving them thousands and thousands of weapons and letting them ship cocaine in the U.S.
[01:09:20.090 --> 01:09:21.351]  That's all come out in federal court.
[01:09:21.351 --> 01:09:24.074]  They've declared national security months ago in Chicago.
[01:09:25.674 --> 01:09:30.196]  Fast and Furious is only the very tip of the iceberg that's coming up.
[01:09:30.196 --> 01:09:36.059]  Herman Cain caught in lies saying that he never said that we don't need to audit the Fed.
[01:09:36.059 --> 01:09:37.700]  Proof of those lies coming up.
[01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:41.241]  Paul Watson has a big article on it at Infowars.com.
[01:09:41.241 --> 01:09:48.065]  But I wanted to just for one segment, we appreciate him joining us here on short notice.
[01:09:48.065 --> 01:09:49.986]  I wanted to get James Dilling poll on because
[01:09:51.558 --> 01:10:10.232]  I saw with horror today that the lower house, even though upwards of 90% in the polls I've seen are against this in Australia and different governments have been thrown out in the last few years, the implementation of the carbon taxes is already bankrupt many of the sheep farmers, beef farmers, but now they're going to jack up the taxes and I've got a
[01:10:10.552 --> 01:10:12.814]  Breakdown per household, home inspectors.
[01:10:12.814 --> 01:10:19.899]  You can just type into the search engine, under carbon tax, green police to inspect home without warrants.
[01:10:19.899 --> 01:10:27.644]  So just unleashing the Soviets, unleashing a new 21st century Bolshevism for the bankers.
[01:10:27.644 --> 01:10:31.727]  And it says protest disrupt question time after carbon bill passes the lower house.
[01:10:31.727 --> 01:10:39.153]  And James Dillingpole, writing for the Telegraph, he also writes for a lot of other big publications and is a best-selling author, says Australia commits suicide.
[01:10:40.053 --> 01:10:44.094]  Yeah, no one, I mean, this is meant to create a post-industrial world.
[01:10:44.094 --> 01:10:49.216]  And of course, the big globalist mafia, they're all exempt, like General Electric from their own carbon taxes.
[01:10:49.216 --> 01:10:54.077]  They ride up here with Ken Lay and Goldman Sachs here in the US.
[01:10:54.077 --> 01:10:59.799]  So, going now to James Dillingpole, joins us to break this down.
[01:10:59.799 --> 01:11:00.939]  You know, I agree with you.
[01:11:00.939 --> 01:11:04.260]  Australia is committing suicide right now.
[01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:08.162]  Even though the public doesn't want it, these are authoritarians.
[01:11:08.162 --> 01:11:09.382]  So, tell us exactly what's happened.
[01:11:11.482 --> 01:11:28.588]  You've got Julia Gillard's coalition administration passing by a very slender majority, I think 74 votes to 72, this tax on Australia which almost none of the people want except for a few liberals in the cities.
[01:11:30.008 --> 01:11:35.172]  A tax on carbon which is going to destroy the Australian economy.
[01:11:35.172 --> 01:11:43.557]  And the reason is that of all the world's major economies, none is more dependent on fossil fuels than Australia.
[01:11:43.557 --> 01:11:50.001]  And the reason for that is Australia is an island of coal, an island of minerals, an island of gas, an island of oil.
[01:11:50.001 --> 01:11:52.863]  Australia has got lots of fossil fuels.
[01:11:52.863 --> 01:11:57.065]  It makes sense for a country like that to use its natural resources.
[01:11:57.065 --> 01:11:57.666]  So here,
[01:11:58.266 --> 01:11:58.426]  Is it?
[01:12:14.658 --> 01:12:17.719]  I think it's a kind of bellwether for the rest of us.
[01:12:17.719 --> 01:12:22.081]  You know, it's not just about this swinging tax on carbon.
[01:12:22.081 --> 01:12:33.545]  You remember the case a few months ago of the Australian farmer who went on hunger strike to protest about the way that his land was not his land?
[01:12:33.545 --> 01:12:38.907]  He bought this farmland but he couldn't clear it of trees because
[01:12:39.987 --> 01:12:49.233]  The trees in Australia have been declared a carbon sink, which means that effectively private property has been abolished in Australia.
[01:12:49.233 --> 01:12:51.774]  You can't clear your own land of trees.
[01:12:51.774 --> 01:13:04.061]  There was another case where a farmer who had cleared his trees around his house as a firebreak was fined by the federal authorities for clearing the trees away from his land.
[01:13:04.061 --> 01:13:04.942]  And guess what happened?
[01:13:05.262 --> 01:13:14.199]  A fire broke out, this guy was the only guy for miles around whose house wasn't burned down because he had sensibly cleaned the- cleared those trees illegally.
[01:13:16.272 --> 01:13:33.066]  Unbelievable, and I saw two years ago sheep farmers under the first regiment of this, because they always jack it up, tying himself to a tower for months in a hunger strike because he has to pay a tax on every sheep he has for their flatulence.
[01:13:33.066 --> 01:13:39.771]  They're saying the methane is evil, and they're taking half his land off limits that he paid for, that had been in his family for generations.
[01:13:40.552 --> 01:13:46.018]  This is so incredible, and then it's cold-blooded in that insiders get exemptions from it.
[01:13:46.018 --> 01:13:51.924]  So it makes the government and the regional governments like these mafia dons, where no one can operate but them.
[01:13:53.548 --> 01:13:58.870]  There was a battle going on for the soul of Australia, just as there's a battle going on all around the world.
[01:13:58.870 --> 01:14:01.291]  It's happening in America, it's happening in Britain.
[01:14:01.291 --> 01:14:15.816]  What's interesting about Australia, I suppose, is that we now have in Australia an opposition party which is absolutely committed to undoing the damage which has been done by this carbon tax.
[01:14:15.816 --> 01:14:21.238]  You know, Tony Abbott, the opposition leader, has vowed in blood, he says,
[01:14:21.678 --> 01:14:26.059]  That he will repeal this carbon tax as soon as he gets into power.
[01:14:26.059 --> 01:14:30.760]  And I think, given the unpopularity of this carbon tax, he will get into power.
[01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:40.062]  It'll be very interesting to see what happens to Australia when it becomes part of the resistance to this global warming craze.
[01:14:40.062 --> 01:14:46.003]  You know, all this stuff that's being imposed on us by the New World Order, the United Nations and so on.
[01:14:46.003 --> 01:14:49.244]  If Australia tries to resist this nonsense, as I believe it will,
[01:14:49.964 --> 01:14:54.348]  What will the rest of the world economies do?
[01:14:54.348 --> 01:14:57.791]  Will they try and punish Australia?
[01:14:57.791 --> 01:15:07.980]  If there are still people like Obama running America, for example, if the EPA still has power, what's going to happen to Australia?
[01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:14.185]  But I like to think that Australia will prove the leader of the resistance in two years' time, and that's a good thing.
[01:15:14.185 --> 01:15:15.466]  I respect those Australians.
[01:15:15.466 --> 01:15:17.468]  I think people power will ultimately decide.
[01:15:17.728 --> 01:15:23.250]  Well, I mean, I've seen polls over the last few years, scientific ones, between 75 and 90 percent.
[01:15:23.250 --> 01:15:24.991]  It's wildly unpopular.
[01:15:24.991 --> 01:15:33.155]  I know some previous governments fell because of it, but their mission to bring in this tyranny is so key that they went ahead and rammed it through regardless.
[01:15:33.155 --> 01:15:37.897]  Now, at least there, they've passed it through their parliament, through their government.
[01:15:37.897 --> 01:15:42.819]  Here, it doesn't pass Congress, so Obama just does it and then gives his friends
[01:15:44.025 --> 01:15:53.981]  Uh, waivers from it, and then in your country, David Cameron, for those that don't know, is supporting carbon taxes, so it doesn't matter what party you vote for, unless it's, I guess, UKIP.
[01:15:55.287 --> 01:16:04.951]  There is a complete democratic deficit in most of the world where this eco-fascism is concerned.
[01:16:04.951 --> 01:16:18.957]  In Britain, all the three major political parties are committed to decarbonising Britain, to imposing these swinging taxes and regulations on us in the name of saving us from a problem that doesn't exist.
[01:16:18.957 --> 01:16:24.800]  In the US you have a similar problem in that Obama bypasses the democratic process
[01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:30.322]  By using his bootboys in the EPA to circumvent the democratic process.
[01:16:30.322 --> 01:16:31.703]  So you have no democracy.
[01:16:31.703 --> 01:16:34.384]  This stuff is being imposed on you against your will.
[01:16:34.384 --> 01:16:42.387]  And the frontrunners are all carbon tax lovers, especially Mitt Romney, now endorsed by Chris Christie.
[01:16:42.387 --> 01:16:47.930]  And I tell conservatives, hey, you know who he, Al Gore thanks him, and he also is the author of Socialist Healthcare.
[01:16:47.930 --> 01:16:52.412]  And they say, well, we like socialism as long as it's a Republican that looks like a Ken doll.
[01:16:53.095 --> 01:16:56.638]  And I just say, but, I mean, he's also for gun control, and they say I'm right to turn him in!
[01:16:56.638 --> 01:17:01.843]  I mean, what's wrong with these people?
[01:17:01.843 --> 01:17:02.764]  I fear that too.
[01:17:02.764 --> 01:17:06.548]  I'm looking to, you know, I look to America because things are so dismal here in Europe.
[01:17:06.548 --> 01:17:13.374]  I look across to America thinking, well, at least something is going to get changed when Obama gets defenestrated.
[01:17:13.374 --> 01:17:17.398]  But I look at your lead candidate at the moment, you know, to take over.
[01:17:18.214 --> 01:17:19.935]  I don't think Romney is the answer.
[01:17:19.935 --> 01:17:20.876]  I really don't.
[01:17:20.876 --> 01:17:24.639]  Doesn't he seem like he's a David Cameron clone?
[01:17:24.639 --> 01:17:28.281]  He does seem like Alex in one and that is my fear.
[01:17:28.281 --> 01:17:33.985]  He is David Cameron redux and that is not what you want America, believe me.
[01:17:33.985 --> 01:17:37.128]  Now, why do you think the power elite want this to the point of
[01:17:38.055 --> 01:17:42.041]  You know, the frontrunner they want in America is just like David Cameron.
[01:17:42.041 --> 01:17:43.623]  I mean, he might as well be Al Gore.
[01:17:43.623 --> 01:17:45.705]  He just has different rhetoric.
[01:17:45.705 --> 01:17:50.492]  Why does the ruling elite, I mean, it's not just a bunch of hippies running around that want to rob rich people.
[01:17:50.492 --> 01:17:51.573]  Why does the elite want this?
[01:17:52.967 --> 01:17:58.710]  Because the managerial elite want somebody who is not going to rock the boat, quite simply.
[01:17:58.710 --> 01:18:00.691]  They do not want a radical in power.
[01:18:00.691 --> 01:18:02.352]  They do not want a game changer.
[01:18:02.352 --> 01:18:08.835]  They do not want somebody who believes in something crazy like restoring the gold standard or anything like that.
[01:18:09.275 --> 01:18:16.180]  They want somebody who can continue as before and hand out the special favors to the special interest groups.
[01:18:16.180 --> 01:18:24.166]  They want another corporatist, you know, a corporatist Republican like, like W was a, well both Bushes were corporatists.
[01:18:24.166 --> 01:18:24.626]  I agree.
[01:18:24.626 --> 01:18:26.828]  Briefly, what's your view on Ron Paul?
[01:18:28.499 --> 01:18:33.140]  Ron Paul, I think he comes up with some very sensible stuff on domestic politics.
[01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:35.681]  I'm not totally convinced about some of the things.
[01:18:35.681 --> 01:18:40.502]  You know, I did not shed a tear for the assassination of Al-Alaqi.
[01:18:40.502 --> 01:18:42.583]  I'm sorry, I know some of your listeners will disagree with that.
[01:18:42.583 --> 01:18:45.044]  I don't give a toss about that guy being offed.
[01:18:45.044 --> 01:18:48.985]  I do, however, agree with him on sound money.
[01:18:48.985 --> 01:18:56.647]  And Alex, I believe that the issue of sound money is going to be the defining issue of our lifetimes.
[01:18:56.647 --> 01:18:57.787]  I think this is the thing
[01:18:57.807 --> 01:18:59.627]  Well, that and the global warming, people.
[01:18:59.627 --> 01:19:03.808]  But I agree with you from following Australia from afar and getting the phone calls.
[01:19:03.808 --> 01:19:06.829]  This is the issue that's got them hopping mad to really see the tyranny.
[01:19:06.829 --> 01:19:12.850]  And now, I was reading City Morning Herald, they're starting home inspections without warrants and bossy bureaucrats.
[01:19:12.850 --> 01:19:17.051]  The more they squeeze, the more resistance it's going to form.
[01:19:17.051 --> 01:19:19.791]  Of course, James Dillingpole is at jamesdillingpole.com.
[01:19:19.791 --> 01:19:22.592]  He writes for The Times, Daily Telegraph and The Spectator.
[01:19:23.252 --> 01:19:28.740]  And his new book is Watermelons, exposing the fact they're green on the outside, commie on the inside.
[01:19:28.740 --> 01:19:29.741]  James, thank you for joining us.
[01:19:30.697 --> 01:19:31.718]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:19:31.718 --> 01:19:32.718]  Good to be on the show.
[01:19:32.718 --> 01:19:33.959]  Good to have you on with us.
[01:19:33.959 --> 01:19:34.439]  Wow.
[01:19:34.439 --> 01:19:37.001]  Yeah, so Australia committing suicide.
[01:19:37.001 --> 01:19:38.582]  They're certainly trying to.
[01:19:38.582 --> 01:19:40.263]  The ruling class is.
[01:19:40.263 --> 01:19:43.665]  I mean, they're putting in the worst carbon taxes I've ever seen.
[01:19:43.665 --> 01:19:44.805]  California's doing it.
[01:19:44.805 --> 01:19:47.467]  Look at California going to Hades in a handbasket.
[01:19:47.467 --> 01:19:49.688]  We're going to come back into the economy briefly.
[01:19:49.688 --> 01:19:51.749]  Then I'm getting into the big news.
[01:19:51.749 --> 01:19:55.612]  Fast and Furious tied into this fake Iran terror plot.
[01:19:56.914 --> 01:19:58.015]  Stay where this is all coming up.
[01:19:58.015 --> 01:20:00.858]  I'm Alex Jones, GCNLive.com.
[01:20:00.858 --> 01:20:04.701]  If you're a man over 40, you may feel like half the man you used to be.
[01:20:04.701 --> 01:20:06.262]  Are you gaining more body fat?
[01:20:06.262 --> 01:20:07.624]  Are you feeling tired?
[01:20:07.624 --> 01:20:09.585]  Are you losing your sex drive?
[01:20:09.585 --> 01:20:10.726]  It's not your fault.
[01:20:10.726 --> 01:20:13.769]  After 40, your body's testosterone may start dropping.
[01:20:13.769 --> 01:20:15.651]  And if you're an African-American man,
[01:20:15.911 --> 01:20:19.795]  You're at a higher risk of your testosterone turning into estrogen.

[01:22:00.444 --> 01:22:11.293]  Hi, I'm Brian Brady for Solutions from Science, and you know, in this economy, it doesn't seem like there is much that any of us can do to cut back on our monthly expenses.

[01:22:28.326 --> 01:22:38.910]  And with many experts predicting electrical rates could double or triple in the next few years, there has never been a better time to make the switch to high-efficiency LEDs.
[01:22:38.910 --> 01:22:39.951]  And here's the best part.

[01:23:53.922 --> 01:24:14.199]  Alright, look, I know we got loaded phones and I want to go to your calls, okay?
[01:24:14.199 --> 01:24:20.484]  But I also need, when we come back, to really spend some time on a couple different issues.
[01:24:20.484 --> 01:24:20.504]  A...
[01:24:21.550 --> 01:24:28.873]  We have Herman Cain caught lying, and the problem is there's so many examples of him saying, no need to audit the Fed, people that want to audit it are dummies.
[01:24:28.873 --> 01:24:30.113]  He wrote it in his book.
[01:24:30.113 --> 01:24:32.274]  He tells Ron Paul it's just not true.
[01:24:32.274 --> 01:24:35.455]  And he doesn't appreciate being misrepresented.
[01:24:35.455 --> 01:24:37.336]  And says it convincingly.
[01:24:37.336 --> 01:24:40.137]  I mean, this guy makes Bill Clinton look like a bad liar, man.
[01:24:40.137 --> 01:24:41.117]  I'm telling you, he's slick.
[01:24:41.117 --> 01:24:43.278]  Because he really looks like he's angry.
[01:24:43.278 --> 01:24:46.599]  He's like, I don't appreciate being misrepresented by you.
[01:24:48.084 --> 01:24:51.145]  And Paul's looking at him going, OK, we're going to check.
[01:24:51.145 --> 01:24:53.406]  Because Paul knows full well he's lying.
[01:24:53.406 --> 01:24:56.708]  Now, I guarantee you they're going to have campaign ads if they get the money.
[01:24:56.708 --> 01:25:00.009]  And he is the third biggest campaign earner.
[01:25:00.009 --> 01:25:02.430]  And he's going to show Cain lying.
[01:25:02.430 --> 01:25:04.011]  That'll be a powerful ad.
[01:25:04.011 --> 01:25:05.812]  The Paul campaign doesn't do that ad.
[01:25:05.812 --> 01:25:14.256]  And I, you know, I recommended, and I know others did, but the ad about the Al Gore cheerleader and the rest of it and the Hillarycare support.
[01:25:14.256 --> 01:25:17.017]  And that pretty much did in old Ricky for now.
[01:25:18.058 --> 01:25:19.459]  Oh, Ricky Bobby Perry.
[01:25:19.459 --> 01:25:21.560]  All right, I'm digressing.
[01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:22.280]  I'm sorry.
[01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:24.061]  That's coming up too.
[01:25:24.061 --> 01:25:27.143]  Okay, but I can't just keep kicking this news down the road.
[01:25:27.143 --> 01:25:30.805]  So I'll hit the Fast and Furious tied into the fake terror plot.
[01:25:30.805 --> 01:25:32.806]  I'll take calls for the rest of the hour.
[01:25:32.806 --> 01:25:39.350]  And then at the start of the next hour, I will start getting into the whole Herman Cain thing.
[01:25:39.350 --> 01:25:40.231]  Let's do it that way.
[01:25:40.231 --> 01:25:41.732]  I want to bring Ted Anderson up here.
[01:25:43.143 --> 01:25:48.046]  And yes, I'm going to promote and push gold and silver on you because I believe in it.
[01:25:48.046 --> 01:25:51.809]  I believed in silver when it was $5 an ounce and it's up at $30 something.
[01:25:51.809 --> 01:25:54.831]  It's been almost up to $50 just the last year.
[01:25:54.831 --> 01:25:57.073]  It shows the volatility.
[01:25:57.073 --> 01:25:59.334]  I was promoting gold when it was $260 an ounce, then $300, then $400, then $500.
[01:25:59.334 --> 01:26:00.695]  It's gone way back up in the $1600s again.
[01:26:04.978 --> 01:26:05.799]  It's been as high as $2,000.
[01:26:05.799 --> 01:26:10.743]  If you look at the 12-year graph, it's only going up because of global dollar devaluation.
[01:26:10.743 --> 01:26:12.644]  And there's a number of minus resources.
[01:26:12.644 --> 01:26:19.690]  I wanted to bring TED up because they've basically knocked out most of the speculators in gold and silver by raising the margin calls.
[01:26:20.530 --> 01:26:24.533]  Uh, the margin amounts to record levels to knock out speculation.
[01:26:24.533 --> 01:26:27.615]  So now it's the real market we're seeing, and it's going back up.
[01:26:27.615 --> 01:26:33.279]  So it looks like gold's found its bottom at around 1600, and silver has found its bottom at around, what, 29 or so.
[01:26:33.279 --> 01:26:37.382]  Uh, and it's only going up from here, from what I've seen historically.
[01:26:37.382 --> 01:26:40.505]  You may be wrong, but they are devaluing currencies worldwide.
[01:26:40.505 --> 01:26:41.946]  Ted Anderson, what say you?
[01:26:42.586 --> 01:26:44.067]  Well, you know what's going on, Alex.
[01:26:44.067 --> 01:26:45.428]  Right now, Italy's in trouble.
[01:26:45.428 --> 01:26:46.468]  Greece is in trouble.
[01:26:46.468 --> 01:26:49.410]  Germany is turning on the printing press to bail them out.
[01:26:49.410 --> 01:26:53.212]  Even places like Switzerland is devaluating their currency.
[01:26:53.212 --> 01:26:57.054]  The United States, obviously, is in the same shape.
[01:26:57.054 --> 01:27:00.956]  And you're right about the bottom of the market was right around $1,600 on gold.
[01:27:02.777 --> 01:27:05.721]  We've seen $1,693.40 already today.
[01:27:05.721 --> 01:27:08.545]  We're almost back to $1,700 an ounce.
[01:27:08.545 --> 01:27:14.513]  Silver, of course, at that $2,829 level, now at $3,318 for a high today.
[01:27:14.513 --> 01:27:19.059]  Obviously, the market is not thinking that the economy is fixed quite yet.
[01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:34.326]  You know, one of the things, I mean, we have that protest that's going on here in Minneapolis, down in the Hennepin Government Center, and the Occupy people, and I was talking to my guys here at the office, we're trying to figure out, well, what can we do to touch these people?
[01:27:34.326 --> 01:27:35.807]  And I thought, you know what I'm going to do?
[01:27:35.807 --> 01:27:44.290]  And if we can get this thing done, we're going to put on an American Dream video, right there, in a big screen TV, and let them watch the story on the front.
[01:27:44.290 --> 01:27:45.291]  That's genius!
[01:27:46.211 --> 01:27:48.252]  Rent a big field nearby.
[01:27:48.252 --> 01:27:49.713]  Advertise it on local radio.
[01:27:49.713 --> 01:27:53.234]  I know I'm on a couple AMs, AM and FM there in your area.
[01:27:53.234 --> 01:27:58.156]  I know you've got other Genesis shows that are on, like Jason Lewis, who's on locally.
[01:27:58.156 --> 01:28:07.799]  And then we can promote that and then get all of those well-meaning, a lot of them collectivist Democrat supporters out and say, here's what the Federal Reserve is all about.
[01:28:07.799 --> 01:28:10.861]  By the way, you're still running that deal, even though silver
[01:28:11.901 --> 01:28:12.121]  I don't
[01:28:34.315 --> 01:28:40.359]  The Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the Federal Reserve, something that these little greenie weenies can understand.
[01:28:40.359 --> 01:28:41.499]  Very well done.
[01:28:41.499 --> 01:28:45.422]  Two free gifts, free shipping, 73 smackers available.
[01:28:45.422 --> 01:28:52.746]  You go to InfoWars.com, you see the big banner, top right-hand corner, it says get two silver dollars, get two free gifts.
[01:28:52.746 --> 01:28:54.687]  That's available at InfoWars.com.
[01:28:54.687 --> 01:28:59.010]  One of the few radio specials you can actually get on the web, or you can call to get those, 800-686-2237.
[01:28:59.010 --> 01:28:59.610]  This is a loss leader.
[01:29:04.249 --> 01:29:04.569]  I think so.
[01:29:19.986 --> 01:29:22.588]  It's such a great educational tool, Alex.
[01:29:22.588 --> 01:29:26.030]  I mean, like you said, these people don't know their head from their rear end, man.
[01:29:26.030 --> 01:29:29.012]  If they watch this video, they'll start to get a clue.
[01:29:29.012 --> 01:29:30.493]  Okay, yeah, exactly.
[01:29:30.493 --> 01:29:37.077]  In fact, get American Dream DVDs at Infowars.com discounted or in this deal from Ted and go give it to these people.
[01:29:37.077 --> 01:29:38.358]  That's the best idea I've ever heard of.
[01:29:38.358 --> 01:29:38.739]  Stay there, Ted.
[01:29:38.739 --> 01:29:40.099]  I want to hear a little bit more about this.
[01:29:40.099 --> 01:29:41.661]  Folks, call today, 800-686-2237.
[01:29:41.661 --> 01:29:47.344]  Yeah, if they think capitalism's the problem, they really need to see this DVD.
[01:29:47.344 --> 01:29:47.384]  800-686-2237.
[01:29:50.247 --> 01:29:53.252]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.252 --> 01:29:56.858]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:02.259 --> 01:30:06.283]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:30:06.283 --> 01:30:09.527]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:30:09.527 --> 01:30:14.332]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:30:14.332 --> 01:30:20.719]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:30:20.719 --> 01:30:22.962]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:30:23.462 --> 01:30:23.782]  Tim Geithner?
[01:30:23.782 --> 01:30:24.042]  Bernanke?
[01:30:24.042 --> 01:30:24.662]  They're arsonists!
[01:30:24.662 --> 01:30:25.423]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:30:25.423 --> 01:30:27.103]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:30:42.389 --> 01:30:49.672]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:30:49.672 --> 01:30:58.775]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv

[01:32:00.766 --> 01:32:01.947]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:32:01.947 --> 01:32:08.871]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:32:08.871 --> 01:32:11.413]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:32:11.413 --> 01:32:16.796]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:32:16.796 --> 01:32:19.838]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:32:19.838 --> 01:32:21.899]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:32:22.159 --> 01:32:28.403]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:32:28.403 --> 01:32:31.785]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:32:31.785 --> 01:32:37.568]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:32:37.568 --> 01:32:39.209]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:32:39.209 --> 01:32:40.510]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:32:40.510 --> 01:32:43.011]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:32:43.191 --> 01:32:47.392]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.

[01:33:03.577 --> 01:33:11.300]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:15.598 --> 01:33:17.359]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:33:17.359 --> 01:33:17.959]  to 2 p.m.
[01:33:17.959 --> 01:33:18.519]  We're here.
[01:33:18.519 --> 01:33:20.100]  Back Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:33:20.100 --> 01:33:26.042]  I'm one of the hardest working people in radio because the truth and freedom and liberty is worth it.
[01:33:26.042 --> 01:33:31.224]  We come back 7 o'clock every night, weeknights, Monday through Friday, 7 p.m.
[01:33:31.224 --> 01:33:32.785]  Central, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:33:35.580 --> 01:33:37.421]  Now I wanted to finish up with Ted Anderson.
[01:33:37.421 --> 01:33:38.961]  That's a great idea, Ted.
[01:33:38.961 --> 01:33:47.743]  You know, you sponsored the Ron Paul Air Force and gave a lot to the blimp as well, with the banner hangs all over the country and the aircraft.
[01:33:47.743 --> 01:33:52.805]  We ought to get that going again this year for this campaign, this cycle.
[01:33:52.805 --> 01:33:56.086]  But what a great idea to take the American Dream, because it's a 35-minute animated
[01:33:57.586 --> 01:34:15.278]  Really, historical documentary that's very entertaining, kind of in a South Park-ian way, minus, you know, the potty humor and stuff, of the Federal Reserve takeover of America, how it's foreign-owned, how it destroys the country, and you're saying you're working on getting one of those big, I guess, blow-up screens, I guess.
[01:34:15.278 --> 01:34:18.920]  Either a big projector or a big screen TV, one of those two.
[01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:22.382]  They also have high-powered projectors that'll shoot it on the sides of buildings.
[01:34:22.382 --> 01:34:26.045]  We were talking about getting one of those and projecting something like that on the side of the Fed.
[01:34:27.455 --> 01:34:29.115]  Yeah, I mean, that would work out perfectly.
[01:34:29.115 --> 01:34:33.496]  Or, you know, the thing about it is that these kids are very motivated.
[01:34:33.496 --> 01:34:39.158]  They know that there's something wrong, so for that reason, they're very smart.
[01:34:39.158 --> 01:34:47.879]  My God, the power of that film, because it's short, compared to them with Obama controllers, they're trying to make them chant into zombies.
[01:34:47.879 --> 01:34:48.840]  There'd be no comparison.
[01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:52.480]  We're like, here's historical information versus zombie chanting.
[01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:55.101]  You might be able to actually save them from zombie servitude.
[01:34:55.521 --> 01:34:58.723]  Yeah, at least some of them, and then they'll start spreading the words to others.
[01:34:58.723 --> 01:35:00.864]  You know, I mean, that's how it works, Alex.
[01:35:00.864 --> 01:35:05.567]  I mean, when you got started, and when I got started, it was very few people that would listen to this kind of thing.
[01:35:05.567 --> 01:35:06.948]  They thought we were nuts.
[01:35:06.948 --> 01:35:15.393]  And now you put a video like this up, I mean, the creation, the creativity, they did such a great job on this video, and they'll captivate these kids.
[01:35:15.393 --> 01:35:19.115]  You know, they'll watch it, and they'll go, oh yeah, now I know who the L.A.
[01:35:19.155 --> 01:35:19.715]  Absolutely.
[01:35:19.715 --> 01:35:22.577]  Folks can buy it in one-offs at Infowars.com, The American Dream.
[01:35:22.577 --> 01:35:26.959]  But the best way to get it is to get Big Brother, The Orwellian Nightmare Come True by Mark Dice.
[01:35:26.959 --> 01:35:35.764]  Free, the free $10 shipping, the free American Dream film DVD, the two silver dollars, $73, 800-686-2237, 800-686-237.
[01:35:35.764 --> 01:35:39.846]  Ted, I need to get to this other news.
[01:35:39.846 --> 01:35:43.148]  I know you're a busy man, but briefly, you're always promoting the silver dollars.
[01:35:43.148 --> 01:35:46.030]  The silver dollars, it is the best deal you're going to find anywhere.
[01:35:46.030 --> 01:35:46.950]  Folks, do the math.
[01:35:46.950 --> 01:35:47.711]  Check it out for yourself.
[01:35:48.251 --> 01:35:49.211]  What about when they call?
[01:35:49.211 --> 01:35:54.994]  There's also another big radio list of gold and silver specials that are only available to radio listeners.
[01:35:54.994 --> 01:35:55.614]  There is.
[01:35:55.614 --> 01:36:02.638]  As a matter of fact, if you even look at the web numbers, they've gone up so much because gold has gone up, but you can still pick up the franc for $3.63.
[01:36:02.638 --> 01:36:04.518]  You'll pay a lot more than that.
[01:36:04.518 --> 01:36:08.200]  Walking Liberties right now are at $16.43.
[01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:09.441]  Want to support Ron Paul?
[01:36:09.441 --> 01:36:11.722]  Why not get a Campaign for Liberty proof coin for $4.98?
[01:36:12.702 --> 01:36:14.063]  It's a quarter of an ounce of gold.
[01:36:14.063 --> 01:36:17.044]  It's a great way to do that, and also have gold in your hand.
[01:36:17.044 --> 01:36:18.105]  I mean, think about it.
[01:36:18.105 --> 01:36:21.987]  If you buy the silver dollars in the videos, you're actually going to have silver dollars.
[01:36:21.987 --> 01:36:27.270]  Someday in the future, those silver dollars could mean the difference between having food and starving.
[01:36:27.270 --> 01:36:29.031]  You know, that's how big of a deal that is.
[01:36:29.031 --> 01:36:31.012]  Plus, they're the real silver dollars.
[01:36:31.012 --> 01:36:36.975]  They're the silver dollars that Thomas Jefferson and company designed in the Constitution for us to have as money.
[01:36:37.435 --> 01:36:39.377]  You know, this is real historical value.
[01:36:39.377 --> 01:36:43.921]  It's not some slug that some off-brand mint had made.
[01:36:43.921 --> 01:36:44.861]  It's the real deal.
[01:36:44.861 --> 01:36:55.370]  Well, Ted, in closing, the good news here is that in the past, when gold and silver dipped momentarily in the last 12 years, you'd be dead as a doornail up there.
[01:36:55.370 --> 01:36:57.933]  But you told me in the last few weeks in this artificial dip,
[01:36:58.453 --> 01:37:21.188]  You've seen record purchasing of gold and silver going on and that really shows that people are waking up and are used to these manipulative cycles now and that they try to manipulate the speculative market but in the physical people are really starting to wake up to what's going on and so people can now still get gold and silver you bought weeks ago at the lower price even though it's gone up a lot.
[01:37:21.188 --> 01:37:24.350]  That's what they get when they call and ask about the list of radio specials 800-686-2237.
[01:37:24.350 --> 01:37:24.771]  Final comments, Ted.
[01:37:28.773 --> 01:37:32.955]  Yeah, just, you know, don't pay attention to what's going on with all this manipulation.
[01:37:32.955 --> 01:37:36.517]  The reality is that the world is falling apart right now.
[01:37:36.517 --> 01:37:38.278]  There's way too much debt.
[01:37:38.278 --> 01:37:40.279]  And the problems aren't solved yet.
[01:37:40.279 --> 01:37:48.644]  And you're going to see gold and silver increase in value as the dollar depletes because the government is still turning to the printing press to solve these problems.
[01:37:48.644 --> 01:37:50.405]  And that's just the way it is.
[01:37:50.405 --> 01:37:53.607]  And you'll see it rise.
[01:37:53.607 --> 01:37:55.347]  I just know that that's what we're in for.
[01:37:56.468 --> 01:38:02.691]  Rising prices in gold and silver, or in reality, the value of the currency is going to fall.
[01:38:02.691 --> 01:38:03.632]  Well said, Ted.
[01:38:03.632 --> 01:38:04.472]  Thank you so much.
[01:38:04.472 --> 01:38:06.553]  That was Ted Anderson joining us.
[01:38:06.553 --> 01:38:08.854]  Okay, here's what I want to do.
[01:38:08.854 --> 01:38:12.996]  I really want to take calls, but I can't sit here and mention this news and not get to it.
[01:38:12.996 --> 01:38:19.920]  So I'm going to go to Aaron, Don, Vincent, David, Ronnie here in just a few minutes, and then I'll continue with calls into the next hour.
[01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:21.641]  But next hour, I'll first get into
[01:38:23.834 --> 01:38:24.014]  That's
[01:38:43.777 --> 01:38:46.938]  of articles here that I have in my hot little hands.
[01:38:46.938 --> 01:38:49.760]  This is from Infowars.com.
[01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:50.400]  U.S.
[01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:57.363]  Iran plotted with Mexican drug cartel to assassinate Saudi ambassador.
[01:38:57.363 --> 01:39:08.687]  Now I told you that with Fast and Furious coming to a head that you would look for a stage terror attack or a foiled attack.
[01:39:08.687 --> 01:39:09.588]  That's a no-brainer.
[01:39:10.575 --> 01:39:14.638]  But I couldn't even imagine that it would be Mexican-associated.
[01:39:14.638 --> 01:39:16.359]  But they want to blur that.
[01:39:16.359 --> 01:39:31.111]  So in the made-up story, the Mexican drug cartels, the ones that Holder's been arming for three years at least, and now it's coming out in the news, I'll get to that, that Hillary, of course, is in charge of this.
[01:39:31.111 --> 01:39:33.533]  False flag against the Second Amendment is only one part of it.
[01:39:34.562 --> 01:39:39.745]  That they would say Mexican drug cartels were involved, but then go on and say there's actually no proof.
[01:39:39.745 --> 01:39:43.747]  It's like, we have a major terror threat, checkpoints nationwide, no warrants.
[01:39:43.747 --> 01:39:50.190]  It's a Constitution-free day because Al-Qaeda wants to get us, but by the way, there's no real credible threat from this.
[01:39:50.190 --> 01:40:01.016]  And then Governor Ridge, of course, admitted back two years ago that when he was head of Homeland Security, Bush would tell him to issue fake terror alerts as a political protection.
[01:40:02.042 --> 01:40:08.288]  Because every time something negative came out, well, uh-oh, DEFCON 5, you know, the terrorists are going to get us.
[01:40:08.288 --> 01:40:12.612]  Oh my gosh, we are in so much trouble.
[01:40:12.612 --> 01:40:14.614]  So here is the headline.
[01:40:14.614 --> 01:40:20.979]  U.S.-Iran plotted with Mexican drug cartel to assassinate Saudi ambassador.
[01:40:20.979 --> 01:40:27.766]  The United States has accused Iran of plotting to kill the Saudi ambassador to the United States and bomb the Saudi embassy in Washington.
[01:40:29.378 --> 01:40:40.644]  So, right as Israel says they want to attack Iran, and right as the drum beating gets the heaviest it's ever been, we had Ray McGovern on, former CIA, to talk about that last week.
[01:40:40.644 --> 01:40:52.050]  Magically, Iran's working with the drug cartels, and there's the good Attorney General fighting Iran, along with the Mexican cartels, while he's not involved arming them, while he's fighting them.
[01:40:52.050 --> 01:40:54.692]  Isn't that just special?
[01:40:58.197 --> 01:40:59.138]  According to U.S.
[01:40:59.138 --> 01:41:06.886]  Attorney General Eric Holder, who has come out in federal court, allows Sinaloa to ship cocaine in and gives them the guns to knock out their competition.
[01:41:06.886 --> 01:41:09.148]  They've declared national security on that and they're not denying it.
[01:41:11.100 --> 01:41:11.480]  So what?
[01:41:11.480 --> 01:41:12.501]  They deal some drugs.
[01:41:12.501 --> 01:41:14.082]  They bring some guns out of the country.
[01:41:14.082 --> 01:41:17.743]  They give guns to people in Tampa and Chicago and Indianapolis.
[01:41:17.743 --> 01:41:19.184]  But they're a good government.
[01:41:19.184 --> 01:41:20.484]  These are good people.
[01:41:20.484 --> 01:41:22.866]  Let them search your car at a checkpoint for drugs.
[01:41:22.866 --> 01:41:24.566]  Makes a lot of sense.
[01:41:24.566 --> 01:41:29.689]  The Justice Department claims Iran and Mexican drug cartels worked together on the plot.
[01:41:29.689 --> 01:41:34.451]  Holder and the Justice Department claim the plot was hatched in Mexico last May.
[01:41:34.451 --> 01:41:36.292]  Two Iranians, Mansoor
[01:41:37.852 --> 01:41:50.140]  Rabbi Seher and Jalom Shakri were accused of the attack in court documents according to the New York Times.
[01:41:50.140 --> 01:41:56.664]  And it goes on, the Justice Department claims Iran and Mexican drug cartels worked together on the plot.
[01:41:56.664 --> 01:41:59.526]  Holder said there is no basis to believe that any
[01:42:00.945 --> 01:42:03.027]  Other conspirators are present in the U.S.
[01:42:03.027 --> 01:42:04.528]  Oh, these are people outside.
[01:42:04.528 --> 01:42:06.450]  I'm sure a drone will kill them.
[01:42:06.450 --> 01:42:09.192]  They'll really just bomb a chicken shack or something and say they killed them.
[01:42:09.192 --> 01:42:11.614]  You know, they killed a Lockheed five, six times.
[01:42:11.614 --> 01:42:13.015]  I mean, why not?
[01:42:13.015 --> 01:42:13.996]  There's no basis.
[01:42:13.996 --> 01:42:14.536]  They're not here.
[01:42:14.536 --> 01:42:16.137]  It's just that he saved you, though.
[01:42:16.137 --> 01:42:27.387]  He said the two men are connected to Quds Force, a division of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.
[01:42:29.642 --> 01:42:33.205]  Right as Israel started to blow up Iran, they would do this.
[01:42:33.205 --> 01:42:34.266]  Sure.
[01:42:34.266 --> 01:42:36.528]  And Easter bunnies lay eggs on Easter.
[01:42:36.528 --> 01:42:44.475]  Holder said the money to support the attack had been transferred through a New York bank, but the men had not yet obtained any explosives.
[01:42:44.475 --> 01:42:54.984]  In addition to holding these individual conspirators accountable for their alleged role, this is his quote, for their alleged role in the plot, the United States is committed to holding Iran accountable for its actions, Holder said.
[01:42:54.984 --> 01:42:55.225]  Yes.
[01:42:55.845 --> 01:43:03.167]  Mr. Liar, who's been caught perjuring himself in Oklahoma City, in the Mark Rich Pardons, in Fast and Furious.
[01:43:03.167 --> 01:43:11.049]  Right as you get subpoenaed to block all this out, you're protecting us from the drug cartels that work with the evil Islamists.
[01:43:11.049 --> 01:43:13.130]  Yes, sure you are.
[01:43:14.841 --> 01:43:19.662]  The Justice Department made the criminal complaint public ahead of a fresh round of sanctions by the U.S.
[01:43:19.662 --> 01:43:26.524]  Treasury Department against the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which is already sanctioned for its role in overseeing Iran's nuclear program.
[01:43:26.524 --> 01:43:26.944]  The U.S.
[01:43:26.944 --> 01:43:31.645]  and Israel accused Iran of secretly using its nuclear energy program to build nuclear weapons.
[01:43:31.645 --> 01:43:38.827]  The Islamic Republic of Iran has rejected the accusation and characterized it as a prefabricated scenario.
[01:43:38.827 --> 01:43:39.207]  I don't know.
[01:43:39.207 --> 01:43:43.688]  The people who run our country have only overthrown Iran twice and staged terror attacks to do it.
[01:43:46.107 --> 01:43:55.614]  Now, let's get into exactly why this is now being brought up.
[01:43:55.614 --> 01:44:05.801]  This is now being brought up because right on time, ISSA issues subpoena to Holder in Fast and Furious investigation.
[01:44:07.208 --> 01:44:09.990]  And we just so happen to have the subpoena.
[01:44:09.990 --> 01:44:12.011]  I have a little copy of it here.
[01:44:12.011 --> 01:44:18.576]  We've got it linked up at Infowars.com if you'd like to go read it for yourself.
[01:44:18.576 --> 01:44:32.205]  And they subpoena the Attorney General, the Deputy, Former Attorney General, the Office of the Attorney General, Acting Deputy Attorney Counsel, Assistant Attorney General, just a whole bunch of these people.
[01:44:32.205 --> 01:44:34.947]  Looks about like 10 of them, 12 of them.
[01:44:34.947 --> 01:44:35.988]  And then you get over here.
[01:44:38.655 --> 01:44:51.384]  James Trustee of the Organized Crime and Gang Section, all these other people, the Criminal Fraud Section, and they want all the communications between all these different organizations and groups.
[01:44:51.384 --> 01:44:59.289]  But if you're already a lying criminal, you know, that's another thing about being the head of the Federal Reserve, like Herman Cain was.
[01:44:59.289 --> 01:45:03.312]  The Federal Reserve's been caught all over the country laundering drug money knowingly, over and over again.
[01:45:03.312 --> 01:45:05.414]  Just do a Google or LexisNexis on that.
[01:45:06.485 --> 01:45:08.566]  Again, these are dirty people.
[01:45:08.566 --> 01:45:20.554]  Just because Holder and Obama and Kaine and Hillary and all these people wear little fancy suits and she wears a big brooch and all this.
[01:45:20.554 --> 01:45:23.015]  This is organized crime that runs our country.
[01:45:23.015 --> 01:45:26.177]  That's what tyranny is.
[01:45:26.177 --> 01:45:27.478]  And it's business as usual.
[01:45:27.478 --> 01:45:30.520]  These are just organized crime puppets, though.
[01:45:34.708 --> 01:45:37.449]  And it continues with all the different things that they're demanding.
[01:45:37.449 --> 01:45:51.794]  And then the Suffolk County report has a report here with Mike Vanderbilt, sources close to the development of the gun walker scheme, state that, and this is what I've gotten out of congressional testimony, similar things.
[01:45:51.794 --> 01:45:57.797]  This goes all the way up into the White House at the highest levels and it's been confirmed that they all knew and they've been caught in emails lying and didn't know.
[01:45:57.797 --> 01:46:03.039]  So, Hillary and her trusted associate, Secretary of State,
[01:46:04.205 --> 01:46:10.251]  Reportedly, Andrew J. Shapiro devised at least part of the framework for what would later become Operation Fast and Furious.
[01:46:10.251 --> 01:46:17.638]  It was Shapiro, reportedly, who first described the details of the proposed scheme early in 2009, just after the Obama administration took office.
[01:46:18.479 --> 01:46:20.800]  Bender Bogue relates the following.
[01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:23.982]  His sources say Hillary's trusted subordinate.
[01:46:23.982 --> 01:46:28.144]  It's come out that this is high-level people in the White House, cabinet level.
[01:46:28.144 --> 01:46:31.286]  They haven't said exactly who, though, in congressional testimony.
[01:46:31.286 --> 01:46:37.209]  It was Shapiro who first described to the Secretary of State the details of the plan.
[01:46:37.209 --> 01:46:41.551]  And of course, this is so public that they've even given speeches before.
[01:46:41.551 --> 01:46:45.794]  Turns out two years ago bragging about Fast and Furious and their gun-walking program.
[01:46:46.544 --> 01:46:51.527]  And now they were gonna use that to track down on semi-automatics and the rest of it.
[01:46:51.527 --> 01:47:03.735]  And now we have, on the heels of all of this, we now have the ATF saying, can't sell more than two rifles.
[01:47:03.735 --> 01:47:05.616]  If you do, call us.
[01:47:05.616 --> 01:47:07.197]  We may do a criminal investigation.
[01:47:07.197 --> 01:47:11.120]  They already know through the NICS system you're buying three shotguns, two handguns, whatever it is.
[01:47:11.120 --> 01:47:11.821]  They already know.
[01:47:11.821 --> 01:47:14.202]  It's already called in.
[01:47:14.202 --> 01:47:15.323]  The FBI put the database.
[01:47:16.718 --> 01:47:20.182]  So then three or four months ago they did that and sent those letters out outside of law.
[01:47:20.182 --> 01:47:22.845]  They tried to pass the law earlier this year, they couldn't.
[01:47:22.845 --> 01:47:26.048]  So they just said, we don't need any stinking law.
[01:47:26.048 --> 01:47:29.612]  You know, just like with EPA, greenhouse gas stuff, we'll just do it.
[01:47:31.226 --> 01:47:32.886]  And so, they're now doing it.
[01:47:32.886 --> 01:47:40.249]  And now they're saying, you've got to find out as a gun shop dealer, as a federal firearms licensee, if somebody's got a medical marijuana card.
[01:47:40.249 --> 01:47:43.709]  And there are literally hundreds of different ailments that marijuana's been proven to help.
[01:47:43.709 --> 01:47:48.311]  Stomach aches, nausea, glaucoma, the list goes on and on.
[01:47:48.311 --> 01:47:51.512]  People that can't eat, don't have an appetite.
[01:47:51.512 --> 01:47:52.692]  Depression, you name it.
[01:47:52.692 --> 01:47:54.853]  I'm not even saying marijuana's good.
[01:47:54.853 --> 01:47:57.013]  Some people it has a bad effect, some people it has a good effect.
[01:47:57.013 --> 01:47:58.273]  It's a drug.
[01:47:58.273 --> 01:47:59.674]  Very complex, natural drug.
[01:48:00.936 --> 01:48:07.440]  But, I'll put it this way, today's marijuana isn't Grandpa George Washington's marijuana.
[01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:09.842]  It's a lot stronger, it's been bred that way.
[01:48:09.842 --> 01:48:28.013]  But the issue here is, the reason I digress is, they're saying, if you've got a medical marijuana card, under law, through your medical doctor, that if you don't ask and find out, they're gonna SWAT Team Raid and put you in jail, and they're gonna SWAT Team Raid people with medical marijuana cards now, and confiscate their guns.
[01:48:30.424 --> 01:48:45.691]  I mean, this is a lawless, brazen group of brutish criminals, violating state's rights and the rights of doctors who are the experts to prescribe marijuana.
[01:48:45.691 --> 01:48:57.397]  I've seen a bunch of big studies where Prozac and Prozac-type drugs actually increase suicide and depression, and they did double-blind studies with THC pills, and it actually helped depression, on average.
[01:49:00.538 --> 01:49:06.181]  But again, I'm not going to sit here and get into the pros and cons of marijuana.
[01:49:06.181 --> 01:49:18.267]  I've said, so that I can be up on the subject and accurately cover it, about once a year, I will try some out, and it is a serious drug.
[01:49:18.267 --> 01:49:21.269]  And I don't recommend young people use it, and I don't think it's cool.
[01:49:21.269 --> 01:49:23.310]  It's turned a lot of folks into deadbeats.
[01:49:23.310 --> 01:49:28.493]  But it does have medical uses, and it's up to the states to
[01:49:30.305 --> 01:49:33.487]  Basically, deal with this and the feds are out of control.
[01:49:33.487 --> 01:49:37.769]  But I now digress, my friends.
[01:49:37.769 --> 01:49:40.050]  Off into other areas.
[01:49:40.050 --> 01:49:44.313]  I want to go to break and come back until 20 after next hour.
[01:49:45.723 --> 01:49:50.628]  And I will take phone calls, 30 minutes or so of phone calls when we come back from break.
[01:49:50.628 --> 01:49:53.431]  And then I'm going to get into really the finale of the transmission.
[01:49:53.431 --> 01:49:58.837]  I've got some military news, I've got some economy news I want to get to.
[01:49:58.837 --> 01:50:03.342]  Families are facing the biggest fall in income since the 1970s, all by design.
[01:50:03.342 --> 01:50:04.443]  I've got an Occupy L.A.
[01:50:04.443 --> 01:50:06.986]  speaker who calls for violence, says violence will be needed.
[01:50:08.803 --> 01:50:14.265]  Wow, we had the survivor of the underwear bomber on, the only witness he was going to call.
[01:50:14.265 --> 01:50:21.048]  Haskell did predict actually on air that it was probably a way to get a plea bargain because they didn't want Haskell testifying.
[01:50:21.048 --> 01:50:22.008]  That happened today.
[01:50:22.008 --> 01:50:27.371]  He's now announced he's going to sue the government for the fact that they almost killed him helping the underwear bomber get on the plane.
[01:50:27.371 --> 01:50:30.092]  That's going to be an amazing civil suit.
[01:50:30.092 --> 01:50:31.312]  That's all coming up.
[01:50:31.312 --> 01:50:32.473]  That broke here.
[01:50:32.473 --> 01:50:34.674]  Dilling poll on the carbon taxes in Australia.
[01:50:34.674 --> 01:50:36.574]  Does Australia commit suicide?
[01:50:36.574 --> 01:50:37.375]  That's his headline.
[01:50:40.209 --> 01:50:43.790]  But coming up, Fed Insider Kane caught in brazen debate lie.
[01:50:43.790 --> 01:50:49.632]  We're going to play the clips, prove the lies, all of it, coming up 20 minutes in the next hour.
[01:50:49.632 --> 01:50:53.793]  But first, three segments of your phone call straight ahead.
[01:50:53.793 --> 01:50:54.393]  Stay with us.
[01:50:54.393 --> 01:50:55.433]  We'll be right back.

[01:51:01.038 --> 01:51:02.339]  What happened, man?
[01:51:02.339 --> 01:51:06.340]  You used to be energetic, happy, and wow, did the ladies love you.
[01:51:06.340 --> 01:51:09.802]  Now, you fall asleep on the couch, irritable, and out of shape.
[01:51:09.802 --> 01:51:11.142]  Don't be that guy!

[01:53:00.959 --> 01:53:04.500]  Smokers, are you still smoking traditional cigarettes?
[01:53:04.500 --> 01:53:10.522]  Are you still smelling up your clothes and car interior, staining your teeth, and getting ashes everywhere?

[01:54:18.643 --> 01:54:36.413]  We're in Louisiana close to New Orleans Way back up in the woods among the evergreens There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode Who never ever learned to read or write so well But he could play a guitar just like a ringin' a bell Go, go!
[01:54:36.413 --> 01:54:38.074]  Go, Johnny, go!
[01:54:38.074 --> 01:54:38.575]  Go!
[01:54:38.575 --> 01:54:40.916]  Go, Johnny, go!
[01:54:40.916 --> 01:54:41.056]  Go!
[01:54:46.437 --> 01:54:56.522]  I'll tell you, I could get so much more done around here if I wasn't always dealing with taxes and bills and scrabbling around trying to feed the coal into this locomotive.
[01:54:56.522 --> 01:54:57.683]  But we've done a lot together.
[01:54:57.683 --> 01:55:02.545]  It's amazing, so I appreciate all your financial support at InfoWars.com.
[01:55:02.545 --> 01:55:04.826]  Okay, that's why I was late getting in here.
[01:55:04.826 --> 01:55:07.448]  They're banging on the door going, get in here.
[01:55:07.448 --> 01:55:09.188]  Let's go ahead and go to your phone calls.
[01:55:09.188 --> 01:55:11.370]  Let's go to Aaron in Wisconsin.
[01:55:11.370 --> 01:55:13.251]  Welcome, you're on the air.
[01:55:13.251 --> 01:55:14.351]  Hey, what's up, buddy?
[01:55:14.351 --> 01:55:15.091]  Hey, Alex.
[01:55:15.091 --> 01:55:15.912]  What's going on with you?
[01:55:16.598 --> 01:55:18.179]  Worldwide Transmission, my friend.
[01:55:18.179 --> 01:55:18.899]  How may I serve you?
[01:55:18.899 --> 01:55:23.863]  Well, I understand the Worldwide Transmission.
[01:55:23.863 --> 01:55:26.084]  You might have to spend a few minutes here.
[01:55:26.084 --> 01:55:32.248]  But first, you know, you're really... You are Johnny B. Goode, you know what I'm saying?
[01:55:32.248 --> 01:55:34.990]  You're showing everyone the example, for one.
[01:55:34.990 --> 01:55:38.632]  And I know you digress, you know what I'm saying?
[01:55:38.632 --> 01:55:45.056]  But it's almost like I'm sitting here trying to respond, and you bring up a lot of topics.
[01:55:45.660 --> 01:55:46.841]  Yeah, I jump around.
[01:55:46.841 --> 01:55:51.483]  I don't just sit here and go, uh-huh, look at Obama, or uh-huh, look at Bush.
[01:55:51.483 --> 01:55:56.766]  I'm pointing out they're just puppets, which is elementary, but for a lot of the public, that's a new idea.
[01:55:56.766 --> 01:55:58.106]  What do you think of all this news?
[01:55:58.106 --> 01:55:59.507]  What are you calling about today?
[01:55:59.507 --> 01:56:02.489]  Because we've got so much going on.
[01:56:02.489 --> 01:56:03.649]  And that's the thing.
[01:56:03.649 --> 01:56:10.673]  I'll get to the point where I came to call in, but I'll also respond to things you went with Ted Anderson.
[01:56:10.673 --> 01:56:14.555]  I mean, just imagine, back in, you could buy comic books for a dime.
[01:56:15.225 --> 01:56:17.426]  And the reason why is made of silver.
[01:56:17.426 --> 01:56:21.167]  You could hand them an object and receive an object.
[01:56:21.167 --> 01:56:26.129]  Nowadays, you have to hand them thousands of digital objects to get something.
[01:56:26.129 --> 01:56:38.114]  When my mom was a child, she could go to the drugstore with 50 cents and get a Coca-Cola, get some cup of candy, and get a grilled cheese for 50 cents.
[01:56:38.114 --> 01:56:40.835]  Now, you can't get a cup of coffee for 50 cents.
[01:56:40.835 --> 01:56:43.676]  It's all about devaluation of the currency.
[01:56:44.974 --> 01:56:45.875]  That's right.
[01:56:45.875 --> 01:56:48.816]  And so Ted brought up a good point.
[01:56:48.816 --> 01:56:54.660]  With Herman Cain, he's going to destroy himself, obviously, for the Federal Reserve.
[01:56:54.660 --> 01:57:01.184]  But part of the movement that we really need to focus on is the term the New World Order.
[01:57:01.184 --> 01:57:07.208]  And we have signs at these Occupy saying, stop the New World Order.
[01:57:07.208 --> 01:57:10.510]  People go online more than they could with the Fed.
[01:57:10.510 --> 01:57:11.190]  Because who knows?
[01:57:11.190 --> 01:57:13.552]  You know, the Fed could put up their own website.
[01:57:13.962 --> 01:57:19.047]  No, I know, but I mean, the Federal Reserve is how the big megabanks get their government power.
[01:57:19.047 --> 01:57:24.653]  It is private, but it's got a deal with the government, and it's been given government power.
[01:57:33.999 --> 01:57:39.282]  And so, that's how you strip them of their power to monetize debt and devalue the currency.
[01:57:39.282 --> 01:57:40.423]  I appreciate your call.
[01:57:40.423 --> 01:57:41.783]  Good to hear from you.
[01:57:41.783 --> 01:57:43.664]  Don in Tennessee, welcome.
[01:57:43.664 --> 01:57:46.986]  Thank you for holding.
[01:57:46.986 --> 01:57:53.310]  This tactic sound like the Celtic Highland Clearances in Scotland and Ireland.
[01:57:53.310 --> 01:58:00.554]  No using the resources on the land, no cutting wood, no burning wood, forbidding the Celtic colors and symbols.
[01:58:02.766 --> 01:58:08.449]  I would like to have maybe some of your British friends talk about that sometime.
[01:58:08.449 --> 01:58:10.049]  Well no, you're absolutely right.
[01:58:10.049 --> 01:58:11.950]  In fact, I've pointed this out.
[01:58:11.950 --> 01:58:13.411]  Stay there, I'll come back to you in a minute.
[01:58:13.411 --> 01:58:15.151]  I don't want to shortchange you.
[01:58:15.151 --> 01:58:23.535]  For those that don't know history, in ancient Japan, in ancient England, in ancient France, the ancient Aztecs, the slave class
[01:58:24.778 --> 01:58:27.000]  Couldn't cut wood, couldn't use resources.
[01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:28.802]  That's how the system controls you.
[01:58:28.802 --> 01:58:35.848]  And the Club of Rome admits, this post-industrial global system, this New World Order, is neo-feudalism.
[01:58:35.848 --> 01:58:37.530]  It is serfdom.
[01:58:37.530 --> 01:58:41.533]  That's what it is.
[01:58:41.533 --> 01:58:43.055]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:58:50.950 --> 01:58:55.492]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:58:55.492 --> 01:58:56.413]  Number 1.
[01:58:56.413 --> 01:58:59.835]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:58:59.835 --> 01:59:00.695]  Number 2.
[01:59:00.695 --> 01:59:05.598]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:05.598 --> 01:59:06.338]  It's true.
[01:59:06.338 --> 01:59:11.201]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:11.201 --> 01:59:12.041]  Number 3.
[01:59:12.041 --> 01:59:15.623]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:59:15.623 --> 01:59:19.305]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:59:19.525 --> 01:59:20.326]  Number 4.
[01:59:20.326 --> 01:59:23.090]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:59:23.090 --> 01:59:26.774]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:59:26.774 --> 01:59:27.555]  Number 5.
[01:59:27.555 --> 01:59:31.701]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:59:31.701 --> 01:59:36.467]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:59:36.747 --> 01:59:40.909]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:40.909 --> 01:59:42.710]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:42.710 --> 01:59:44.951]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[01:59:47.553 --> 01:59:49.073]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:49.073 --> 01:59:54.796]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.717 --> 02:00:10.539]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.539 --> 02:00:12.119]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.119 --> 02:00:13.520]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.520 --> 02:00:17.862]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.862 --> 02:00:23.164]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.164 --> 02:00:33.868]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now into our number three, and we are taking your phone calls ahead of a breakdown of the deception of Herman Cain and the Private Fellow Reserve and more.
[02:00:36.027 --> 02:00:38.510]  About eight stacks of news I haven't gotten to yet, though I'm pretty proud.
[02:00:38.510 --> 02:00:39.851]  We've actually done a better job than usual.
[02:00:39.851 --> 02:00:43.756]  We've covered a ton of important information so far.
[02:00:43.756 --> 02:00:50.363]  Don in Tennessee said, hey, these carbon taxes, these shutdowns of people's land, not letting them use their own property.
[02:00:51.351 --> 02:00:52.911]  Not letting them cut trees.
[02:00:52.911 --> 02:00:57.793]  This sounds like the different feudal rules they had on the people of Scotland.
[02:00:57.793 --> 02:01:01.153]  Well, feudalism is the same in every culture, yes.
[02:01:01.153 --> 02:01:04.334]  But, sir, you're not just seeing a similarity.
[02:01:04.334 --> 02:01:14.577]  The UN, the Club of Rome, Al Gore, Jacques Cousteau before he died, Prince Philip, Prince Charles' dad, Prince Charles, Queen Elizabeth II,
[02:01:17.594 --> 02:01:21.377]  Maury Strong, all these people, they say that's what they're setting up.
[02:01:21.377 --> 02:01:23.519]  And then, of course, they're all exempt from it.
[02:01:23.519 --> 02:01:35.888]  Here in Austin, I've got a report where there's one pecan tree, where they wanted to build a giant high-rise building, which the city stole a bunch of property around Austin and said, build only dense stuff, so that's one rule.
[02:01:35.888 --> 02:01:46.236]  But this wasn't an insider company, so the committee said, well, this, it's not even that big of a tree, this pecan, you can't cut it, so you can't build a high-rise condo.
[02:01:47.369 --> 02:01:50.870]  And it's all about power.
[02:01:50.870 --> 02:01:54.452]  Now, the globalists want to bomb all over the world and blow up trees, that's fine.
[02:01:54.452 --> 02:01:58.113]  But again, it's about selectively, as lords, dominating people.
[02:01:58.113 --> 02:02:01.414]  Go ahead and finish your points on that, sir.
[02:02:01.414 --> 02:02:03.355]  Yes, sir, I'm about finished.
[02:02:03.355 --> 02:02:09.618]  I guess the climax was the British Red Coat soldiers killing women and children in the Highlands.
[02:02:09.618 --> 02:02:13.779]  I mean, just shooting whole valleys full of people.
[02:02:13.779 --> 02:02:15.500]  And they're doing that now in the
[02:02:16.082 --> 02:02:20.145]  Africa and other foreign countries.
[02:02:20.145 --> 02:02:22.848]  But, thank you.
[02:02:22.848 --> 02:02:23.648]  Well, thank you, sir.
[02:02:23.648 --> 02:02:24.709]  I appreciate your call.
[02:02:24.709 --> 02:02:31.314]  I mean, look, every culture that's dominant throughout history goes and murders everybody.
[02:02:31.314 --> 02:02:36.579]  Nowadays, you know, one African tribe is more powerful than the other, they go slaughter them.
[02:02:36.579 --> 02:02:39.821]  One Mesoamerican tribe is more powerful than the other, they go slaughter them.
[02:02:39.821 --> 02:02:41.543]  And those that keep alive and do the slave work?
[02:02:42.438 --> 02:02:49.165]  You know, you don't cut a tree, you don't kill anything, you starve to death.
[02:02:49.165 --> 02:02:55.612]  That's why the old saying is, you could tell in Europe, the nobles would be like a foot taller healthier than the general public.
[02:02:56.294 --> 02:03:00.897]  Because of people, you know, generation of generation at subsistence level.
[02:03:00.897 --> 02:03:06.760]  And the little kids are standing around with their ribs all sticking out and the lords all ride-by, all healthy.
[02:03:06.760 --> 02:03:08.421]  That was part of their domination.
[02:03:08.421 --> 02:03:09.562]  They wrote handbooks on it.
[02:03:09.562 --> 02:03:11.123]  Keep them starving to death.
[02:03:11.123 --> 02:03:12.764]  Keep them subsistence.
[02:03:12.764 --> 02:03:18.007]  So of course, the royalty with the Rothschilds and others, that's what environmentalism is.
[02:03:18.007 --> 02:03:21.570]  It's not just keeping you skinny and starving.
[02:03:21.570 --> 02:03:25.392]  Their carbon taxes will kill about a billion people, they admit, and they're very proud of it.
[02:03:26.161 --> 02:03:29.424]  Your average liberal Nazi trendy will tell you, yeah, we gotta kill people.
[02:03:29.424 --> 02:03:31.486]  Yeah, it's good.
[02:03:31.486 --> 02:03:34.008]  But see, they want your house, your money, your taxes.
[02:03:34.008 --> 02:03:36.650]  They're gonna live large.
[02:03:36.650 --> 02:03:37.851]  They're not really liberals.
[02:03:37.851 --> 02:03:41.794]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[02:03:41.794 --> 02:03:45.457]  Just like these mainline conservatives know exactly what they're doing.
[02:03:45.457 --> 02:03:46.178]  Gun control?
[02:03:46.178 --> 02:03:47.319]  Mitt Romney's for it.
[02:03:47.319 --> 02:03:48.200]  Conservatives are like...
[02:03:49.605 --> 02:03:51.907]  Limbaugh says it's cool, I'm for it.
[02:03:51.907 --> 02:03:52.908]  Take my guns!
[02:03:52.908 --> 02:03:54.069]  Immediately!
[02:03:54.069 --> 02:03:55.450]  Alex, shut up liberal!
[02:03:55.450 --> 02:03:56.811]  I'm like, I'm against giving my guns up.
[02:03:56.811 --> 02:03:57.892]  Shut up communist!
[02:03:57.892 --> 02:03:59.393]  Turning your guns into freedom!
[02:03:59.393 --> 02:04:02.655]  I mean, it's just like total mental illness.
[02:04:02.655 --> 02:04:04.397]  Hey, they're for carbon taxes.
[02:04:04.397 --> 02:04:06.178]  Well good, I'm for it.
[02:04:06.178 --> 02:04:08.520]  Wrote the government health care plan.
[02:04:08.520 --> 02:04:11.322]  Average conservative goes, hey, I vote for Romney.
[02:04:11.322 --> 02:04:13.124]  Fox News says I'm a winner.
[02:04:13.124 --> 02:04:14.445]  I want to feel good.
[02:04:14.445 --> 02:04:15.586]  I'm against guns.
[02:04:15.586 --> 02:04:16.947]  I'm for carbon taxes.
[02:04:16.947 --> 02:04:17.848]  I like Obamacare.
[02:04:19.022 --> 02:04:25.465]  But I hate Obama because he wants my guns and is for Obamacare.
[02:04:25.465 --> 02:04:28.546]  But wait, Mitt Romney's for it.
[02:04:28.546 --> 02:04:30.446]  But that's different.
[02:04:30.446 --> 02:04:31.687]  It's double think.
[02:04:31.687 --> 02:04:33.468]  It's feeling like they're winners.
[02:04:33.468 --> 02:04:35.849]  Just like your average idiot collectivist.
[02:04:35.849 --> 02:04:37.429]  I mean, they just don't know.
[02:04:37.429 --> 02:04:39.210]  They're morons.
[02:04:39.210 --> 02:04:42.051]  They repeat what they hear on TV.
[02:04:42.051 --> 02:04:43.972]  It makes them feel smart.
[02:04:43.972 --> 02:04:46.893]  It's all boiled down at a third grade level for them.
[02:04:48.396 --> 02:04:49.638]  And they like it.
[02:04:49.638 --> 02:04:52.581]  And they want to get hurt bad.
[02:04:52.581 --> 02:04:55.084]  They serve weakness.
[02:04:55.084 --> 02:04:56.867]  They have a religion of being suckers.
[02:05:01.078 --> 02:05:03.619]  You can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.
[02:05:03.619 --> 02:05:15.883]  Alex has told you about the amazing, great-tasting, long-term, storable food from eFoodsDirect and how a food savings account is your best insurance against natural disasters, job loss, and high food costs.
[02:05:15.883 --> 02:05:23.046]  But did you know that this dehydrated food also protects you against food-borne contaminants like E. coli and salmonella?
[02:05:23.266 --> 02:05:27.387]  Those poisonous critters can't live in low-moisture food from eFoodsDirect.
[02:05:27.387 --> 02:05:29.728]  Ask for the Alex Fall Special.
[02:05:29.728 --> 02:05:34.549]  The Fall Special is a 24-day supply of food in a convenient, portable container.
[02:05:34.549 --> 02:05:35.050]  A $259 value for only $199.
[02:05:35.050 --> 02:05:35.350]  Save $60 on $199.
[02:05:39.991 --> 02:05:40.171]  You bet!
[02:06:02.096 --> 02:06:03.817]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:06:03.817 --> 02:06:09.120]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:06:09.120 --> 02:06:10.661]  Saving means to make money.
[02:06:10.661 --> 02:06:19.446]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:06:20.166 --> 02:06:27.710]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:06:27.710 --> 02:06:35.714]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:06:35.714 --> 02:06:40.957]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[02:06:40.957 --> 02:06:43.098]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-
[02:06:44.619 --> 02:06:49.101]  Call 800-340-7091 or see Calvin on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[02:06:49.101 --> 02:06:53.604]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091 or see Calvin on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[02:07:02.225 --> 02:07:04.806]  And you're subject to public police action.
[02:07:04.806 --> 02:07:06.087]  Tyranny is here.
[02:07:06.087 --> 02:07:09.949]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:07:09.949 --> 02:07:12.250]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:07:12.250 --> 02:07:18.114]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:07:18.114 --> 02:07:24.317]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:07:24.777 --> 02:07:30.743]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:07:30.743 --> 02:07:34.926]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:07:34.926 --> 02:07:39.210]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:07:39.210 --> 02:07:45.175]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:07:45.175 --> 02:07:48.718]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:07:48.718 --> 02:07:50.700]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:07:50.700 --> 02:07:51.121]  It's here.
[02:07:51.801 --> 02:08:01.568]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:08:01.568 --> 02:08:10.814]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:10.814 --> 02:08:13.876]  Now, I've got Rob Dew back there for InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:08:13.876 --> 02:08:16.838]  He's found a bunch of other examples we're going to play tonight.
[02:08:17.950 --> 02:08:37.681]  But in Paul Watson's article at Infowars.com, Fed Insider Cain caught in brazen debate line, we're going to play this clip, where it cuts from him getting mad at Ron Paul and saying, I'm tired of you misrepresenting me and saying I don't want an audit.
[02:08:37.681 --> 02:08:40.102]  I want an audit!
[02:08:40.102 --> 02:08:41.823]  And I didn't call people stupid that wanted one.
[02:08:41.823 --> 02:08:43.944]  And Ron Paul's like, oh really?
[02:08:43.944 --> 02:08:44.765]  I'll get the quote then.
[02:08:46.118 --> 02:08:48.639]  Paul Watson has a link to it on Infowars.com.
[02:08:48.639 --> 02:08:51.301]  He wrote and said, people that want an audit are stupid.
[02:08:51.301 --> 02:08:54.823]  That's a quote.
[02:08:54.823 --> 02:08:59.345]  He also said it on Neil Bortz's show that an audit isn't needed.
[02:08:59.345 --> 02:09:05.008]  And Dew has found other quotes.
[02:09:05.008 --> 02:09:06.889]  So it just shows the deception.
[02:09:06.889 --> 02:09:11.492]  We've also got Ron Paul talking about how Herman Cain's answer on the subject
[02:09:13.144 --> 02:09:15.586]  Hello Alex, I just want to make three points.
[02:09:15.586 --> 02:09:18.268]  I'll try to be real quick.
[02:09:18.268 --> 02:09:24.892]  The first point I want to make is that this coming Saturday, October 15th, anybody that's listening in the Midwest,
[02:09:39.378 --> 02:09:47.640]  Occupy Omaha is meeting up at 9 o'clock in the morning at the Omaha City Hall and then marching to the Federal Reserve Building in Omaha.
[02:09:47.640 --> 02:10:06.384]  The second point I want to make is that for any of our listeners, any of the Ron Paul people who are listening to this and who are getting involved in Occupy Omaha or reaching out to them, my suggestion would be, and we're doing up here, is we're setting up days where we have seminars or education events to
[02:10:07.299 --> 02:10:13.262]  Educate these people on how the federal reserve works, and how the system works, and how central banking works.
[02:10:13.262 --> 02:10:29.429]  And if you as a person is not that well-versed on the issue, then I would suggest that you set up a day where you have a movie screening of the video, uh, Freed from the Fascism, or the one I like is, uh, Money Banking in the Federal Reserve by the Von Mises Institute.
[02:10:29.429 --> 02:10:34.751]  Uh, and then the third point I want to make, I just want to say that, uh, I'm one of those stupid people that
[02:10:35.356 --> 02:10:35.977]  We're good to go.
[02:10:47.532 --> 02:10:52.597]  And then after that he just talked about how people who want an audit are crazy.
[02:11:06.610 --> 02:11:10.211]  And they had a guy whose job before that had been as a mascot in a bee suit.
[02:11:10.211 --> 02:11:11.952]  He knew nothing about it.
[02:11:11.952 --> 02:11:16.534]  And he said, listen, you're putting out this disinfo that the Federal Reserve isn't a government institution.
[02:11:16.534 --> 02:11:18.254]  It is, and you're going to stop that.
[02:11:18.254 --> 02:11:19.334]  And I said, well, let me show you proof.
[02:11:19.334 --> 02:11:21.415]  He said, I don't want to see it.
[02:11:21.415 --> 02:11:23.496]  You need to get off these conspiracy theories.
[02:11:23.496 --> 02:11:25.797]  And he'd been warned.
[02:11:25.797 --> 02:11:29.878]  Because he heard other hosts, national ones, saying it was government.
[02:11:29.878 --> 02:11:31.579]  And it's such a hoax.
[02:11:32.662 --> 02:11:33.782]  That they live under.
[02:11:33.782 --> 02:11:38.604]  So Herman Cain said to you, I don't get into conspiracies, even mentioning the Federal Reserve.
[02:11:38.604 --> 02:11:41.764]  Again, I remember back if you mentioned the CFR.
[02:11:41.764 --> 02:11:45.325]  Limbaugh would say it didn't exist 20 years ago.
[02:11:45.325 --> 02:11:49.246]  Again, that's how long they've kept conservatives in the dark.
[02:11:49.246 --> 02:11:57.729]  That's these neocons' job, is to just sit on top people and make sure that they never find out the truth.
[02:11:57.729 --> 02:11:58.349]  Anything else, sir?
[02:11:59.534 --> 02:12:04.718]  Well, I just also want to add that after that incident, he also toured Iowa.
[02:12:04.718 --> 02:12:08.020]  And I was not the only one who questioned him on the Federal Reserve issue.
[02:12:08.020 --> 02:12:19.448]  And after his two-week tour, after being cornered by all these activists all over the state of Iowa, then he came out with a video on YouTube talking about how he supports the Fed, how he supports Conor St.
[02:12:19.448 --> 02:12:20.589]  Paul's audit of the Fed.
[02:12:21.383 --> 02:12:26.025]  Because of us cornering him all over the state of Iowa, he switched his, uh... No, no, you're right.
[02:12:26.025 --> 02:12:33.508]  He's gone from six months ago saying you're a kook, you're a liar, you're a nut, you know, to talk bad about it's a conspiracy theory.
[02:12:33.508 --> 02:12:37.050]  I mean, now having an opinion monetarily is a conspiracy theory.
[02:12:37.050 --> 02:12:38.651]  That's like, you don't like being groped by the TSA?
[02:12:38.651 --> 02:12:39.951]  You're a conspiracy theorist.
[02:12:39.951 --> 02:12:42.532]  Now it's not even that they're debating information.
[02:12:42.532 --> 02:12:48.115]  Now having a view, like I like chocolate ice cream instead of strawberry, that's a conspiracy theory.
[02:12:48.755 --> 02:12:51.039]  I mean, literally, it's mind control.
[02:12:51.039 --> 02:12:52.823]  And yes, he's changed his tune.
[02:12:53.829 --> 02:12:55.630]  And said, well of course I'm for an audit.
[02:12:55.630 --> 02:12:57.751]  I've never said I wasn't.
[02:12:57.751 --> 02:13:01.152]  This is outrageous that you would say such a thing.
[02:13:01.152 --> 02:13:05.814]  And he says it with a straight face, which again, shows you what a liar he is.
[02:13:05.814 --> 02:13:13.678]  I saw one commenter on InfoWars.com in the article today saying, Herman Cain lies just as easy as he tightens his tie.
[02:13:13.678 --> 02:13:16.319]  I mean, it's just automatic, corporate.
[02:13:16.319 --> 02:13:18.660]  People are like, we need somebody with business experience.
[02:13:18.660 --> 02:13:21.021]  The big corporations, whatever made you think corporations
[02:13:21.826 --> 02:13:23.767]  Can't be good, bad, or ugly.
[02:13:23.767 --> 02:13:25.548]  Or indifferent.
[02:13:25.548 --> 02:13:31.711]  The big mega-corporations, like Pillsbury that he worked for, go in and buy off politicians.
[02:13:31.711 --> 02:13:34.412]  That's their business.
[02:13:34.412 --> 02:13:36.554]  Many corporations are bigger than most governments now.
[02:13:36.554 --> 02:13:41.196]  And there's this idea that they're perfect, or their corporate welfare is good.
[02:13:41.196 --> 02:13:44.318]  Alright, now I'm ranting.
[02:13:44.318 --> 02:13:47.539]  David in Oklahoma, you're on the air, thanks for holding.
[02:13:47.539 --> 02:13:50.961]  Well, good afternoon, you Bolshevik youth.
[02:13:52.088 --> 02:13:52.548]  Exactly.
[02:13:52.548 --> 02:13:53.588]  I won't turn my guns in.
[02:13:53.588 --> 02:13:55.229]  I'm a Bolshevik now.
[02:13:55.229 --> 02:13:55.789]  That's right.
[02:13:55.789 --> 02:13:56.069]  Yeah.
[02:13:56.069 --> 02:13:56.729]  Check it out.
[02:13:56.729 --> 02:13:56.989]  All right.
[02:13:56.989 --> 02:13:57.709]  Check this out.
[02:13:57.709 --> 02:14:04.091]  I see the, um, I want to talk about the, um, false flag deal down in, uh, Mexico.
[02:14:04.091 --> 02:14:07.232]  And, uh, it's actually, it's going to serve two purposes.
[02:14:07.232 --> 02:14:17.114]  Number one is going to legitimize Fast and Furious because now they can say, uh, well, if we didn't have Fast and Furious going on, we would have never found out about this.
[02:14:17.114 --> 02:14:17.554]  Secondly,
[02:14:18.630 --> 02:14:24.494]  Is that, oh well, you know, you've got a guy on the Republican side saying that Iran should have nukes.
[02:14:24.494 --> 02:14:40.924]  Now, if, since we found out this thing about Iran is that state-sponsored terror is going on here, then this guy here, he's completely illegitimate now because he wants Iran to have nukes for their, you know, for their power consumption and stuff.
[02:14:41.565 --> 02:14:43.466]  Sir, I'm gonna stop you.
[02:14:43.466 --> 02:14:45.407]  This guy's a genius.
[02:14:45.407 --> 02:14:48.988]  That is exactly, David, what I meant to get to.
[02:14:48.988 --> 02:14:53.771]  When they come out, Walfast and Furious subpoenas go out, the day of it,
[02:14:54.733 --> 02:15:15.480]  and say Iran wanted to blow up an embassy in DC but we don't have any proof and the guys have left the country and they are actually saying this is why our surveillance of the Mexican cartels is so important and I bet you're right they're going to start going after Ron Paul for saying stay out of the Middle East and Central Asia's business.
[02:15:15.480 --> 02:15:17.060]  You are absolutely correct.
[02:15:17.060 --> 02:15:20.582]  I mean how obvious does this have to get Ronnie?
[02:15:20.582 --> 02:15:21.802]  Or not Ronnie, David.
[02:15:22.553 --> 02:15:22.933]  Yeah.
[02:15:22.933 --> 02:15:32.956]  Well, you know, it's one of those kind of things that, you know, when you've been awakened, then you can, you, you, you, you now know that there's something beyond the surface.
[02:15:32.956 --> 02:15:33.996]  You know?
[02:15:33.996 --> 02:15:37.017]  And, um, I mean, there's, it, it, it's clear.
[02:15:37.017 --> 02:15:39.777]  I mean, anything, next thing you do, they're going to kill Bin Laden again.
[02:15:39.777 --> 02:15:40.698]  I'm telling you.
[02:15:40.698 --> 02:15:41.018]  It's coming.
[02:15:41.018 --> 02:15:44.559]  They're going to kill Bin Laden again.
[02:15:44.559 --> 02:15:45.679]  It's coming.
[02:15:45.679 --> 02:15:47.719]  They say they killed a Lockheed five times.
[02:15:47.719 --> 02:15:49.900]  They're going to kill him again too.
[02:15:51.391 --> 02:15:52.271]  And you know what?
[02:15:52.271 --> 02:15:54.452]  As an encore, they're going to bring back Saddam Hussein.
[02:15:54.452 --> 02:15:56.772]  Watch what I tell you.
[02:15:56.772 --> 02:15:59.392]  Man, you're good!
[02:15:59.392 --> 02:16:00.112]  Watch what I tell you.
[02:16:00.112 --> 02:16:00.913]  But yeah, that's all.
[02:16:00.913 --> 02:16:05.813]  I don't get a chance to call you that much anymore, because I'm back on the road now.
[02:16:05.813 --> 02:16:09.834]  But this thing here, it's just crazy.
[02:16:09.834 --> 02:16:12.555]  And I've got family that live in Chicago.
[02:16:12.555 --> 02:16:13.795]  I'm from Chicago originally.
[02:16:13.795 --> 02:16:18.576]  And I've got family that live in Chicago, and they literally worship the ground Obama walks on.
[02:16:18.576 --> 02:16:20.656]  I've got one cousin that's kind of halfway getting away.
[02:16:21.275 --> 02:16:26.882]  And she's in the banking world and she is on the retail side.
[02:16:26.882 --> 02:16:34.911]  And the next time I get to talk to her, I'm going to share the insight that she had about how the big banks, they don't want our retail business anymore.
[02:16:34.911 --> 02:16:36.473]  And she's going to hit the fan.
[02:16:36.473 --> 02:16:42.119]  She just got this new six figure job and she's probably happy right now, but it's going to be short lived.
[02:16:43.271 --> 02:16:44.312]  Well, that's a great point.
[02:16:44.312 --> 02:16:47.173]  I mean, they've already laid off 50-something thousand this year at Bank of America.
[02:16:47.173 --> 02:16:51.955]  They're announcing they plan to cut way back on the retail banking sector.
[02:16:51.955 --> 02:16:54.017]  And that's something that'll really get people's attention.
[02:16:54.017 --> 02:16:55.157]  I appreciate your call.
[02:16:55.157 --> 02:16:56.438]  Anything else you want to add, David?
[02:16:56.438 --> 02:16:58.259]  No, no, I'm doing it, man.
[02:16:58.259 --> 02:16:59.059]  Keep it up.
[02:16:59.059 --> 02:16:59.960]  God bless you.
[02:16:59.960 --> 02:17:00.560]  God bless you.
[02:17:00.560 --> 02:17:04.162]  Yeah, I mean, the day the subpoenas go out, yesterday,
[02:17:05.899 --> 02:17:07.901]  They come out and announce to cover it up.
[02:17:07.901 --> 02:17:09.163]  We stopped Iran!
[02:17:09.163 --> 02:17:10.785]  We were tracking the Mexican cartels.
[02:17:10.785 --> 02:17:12.547]  See, Fast and Furious was good.
[02:17:12.547 --> 02:17:15.411]  Iran was gonna blow up the embassy.
[02:17:15.411 --> 02:17:19.456]  And they know conservatives hate Iran so much.
[02:17:19.456 --> 02:17:21.758]  And love getting scared of them.
[02:17:21.758 --> 02:17:22.259]  So much.
[02:17:23.519 --> 02:17:29.484]  And have a fetish to crawl on the ground and hide under their bed and shake in fear at night.
[02:17:29.484 --> 02:17:32.867]  That they're like, I like Holder now, he's fought Al Qaeda.
[02:17:32.867 --> 02:17:37.211]  And we're like, but they gave it Libya to Al Qaeda.
[02:17:37.211 --> 02:17:39.853]  Doesn't matter, they fought them by handing it over to them.
[02:17:39.853 --> 02:17:42.535]  And I like carbon taxes and I like gun control.
[02:17:42.535 --> 02:17:44.737]  I like Mitt Romney.
[02:17:44.737 --> 02:17:47.740]  I like the fact that he wrote the health care bill for Obama.
[02:17:47.740 --> 02:17:48.900]  Get out of here, you Bolshevik!
[02:17:48.900 --> 02:17:50.422]  And I'm like, I'm against socialist health care.
[02:17:50.422 --> 02:17:51.242]  Shut up, Comey!
[02:17:52.378 --> 02:17:54.180]  Lenin is conservative!
[02:17:54.180 --> 02:17:56.461]  George Washington is commie!
[02:17:56.461 --> 02:17:57.342]  Get out of here!
[02:17:57.342 --> 02:18:00.625]  I like it!
[02:18:00.625 --> 02:18:02.066]  Sorry, that's how they operate now.
[02:18:02.066 --> 02:18:03.467]  I mean, that's it.
[02:18:03.467 --> 02:18:04.908]  And the guy's right.
[02:18:04.908 --> 02:18:10.192]  I mean, they claim they killed Kemal Ali three, four times.
[02:18:10.192 --> 02:18:11.153]  I've seen some of these terrorists.
[02:18:11.153 --> 02:18:13.315]  They've killed more than a dozen times.
[02:18:13.315 --> 02:18:14.176]  I went and did the math.
[02:18:14.176 --> 02:18:20.120]  It's five times they say they were sure they killed Amr al-Awlaki.
[02:18:20.120 --> 02:18:21.722]  And they never retract the last time they killed him.
[02:18:22.802 --> 02:18:23.683]  And you're probably right.
[02:18:23.683 --> 02:18:25.384]  They probably will kill Bin Laden again.
[02:18:25.384 --> 02:18:26.205]  Don't give them ideas.
[02:18:26.205 --> 02:18:27.886]  They'll kill him every week.
[02:18:27.886 --> 02:18:33.850]  Maybe they'll have a piñata on national TV every Sunday and Obama will go out and beat up the piñata of Bin Laden.
[02:18:33.850 --> 02:18:34.791]  And there he is.
[02:18:34.791 --> 02:18:36.512]  He'll be ritually killed over and over again.
[02:18:36.512 --> 02:18:42.797]  The reason I called the last caller Ronnie is because Ronnie is up next in Texas.
[02:18:42.797 --> 02:18:43.938]  Ronnie in Texas.
[02:18:43.938 --> 02:18:46.220]  Welcome.
[02:18:46.220 --> 02:18:47.260]  Thank you, sir.
[02:18:47.260 --> 02:18:48.301]  Yes, let's re-proceed.
[02:18:48.301 --> 02:18:48.801]  Thank you, Jerry.
[02:18:48.801 --> 02:18:51.944]  And here I am in Austin and yesterday there were three things I want to mention.
[02:18:52.614 --> 02:19:01.076]  When I witnessed most, if not all, protesters outside of City Hall were praising my Ron Paul sign as I dutifully stood across the street.
[02:19:01.076 --> 02:19:07.377]  Because I'm still supposedly banned, threatened with a warrant for criminal trespassing if I dare to set foot on the City Hall.
[02:19:07.377 --> 02:19:10.738]  Because our delusional laughing stock of a mayor... By the way, that is on the news.
[02:19:10.738 --> 02:19:17.239]  You're not allowed to be at City Hall and Citizens Communication for saying your name is Ronnie Reiferseed.
[02:19:17.239 --> 02:19:19.160]  And now they're banning other free speech.
[02:19:19.160 --> 02:19:20.220]  They are our supreme rulers.
[02:19:21.052 --> 02:19:23.874]  That's right, John Bush was also banned for a year.
[02:19:23.874 --> 02:19:38.043]  And from the help of my good friend, Clay DeFoe, Mr. Mayor Leffingwell now knows that me, John Bush, and others are not just standing idly by while our rights are being shredded before our eyes by the whim of this laughingstock of a mayor that we have.
[02:19:38.043 --> 02:19:42.426]  Two things I wanted to also mention was about the debate last night.
[02:19:42.426 --> 02:19:44.607]  In lockstep amnesia, those pundits
[02:19:45.307 --> 02:19:53.011]  They just excluded, as usual, OB-GYN Dr. Ron Paul, focusing fiercely on Mitt Romneycare and Governor Gardefell.
[02:19:53.011 --> 02:19:57.154]  And they even gave Mr. Nobody Newt Gingrich the floor many, many times.
[02:19:57.154 --> 02:20:00.536]  Now they always give Ron Paul the least amount of time because he's the only real guy.
[02:20:02.418 --> 02:20:08.122]  Our rights as individuals to freely purchase dietary supplements over the counter are under constant attack.
[02:20:08.122 --> 02:20:12.284]  The globalists want to ban all supplements formulated after 1994.
[02:20:12.284 --> 02:20:18.027]  Governments are hoarding raw materials, affecting our ability to purchase these products at a reasonable price.
[02:20:18.027 --> 02:20:23.671]  Even organic foods are stripped of nutrients due to overuse of soil and compromised growing conditions.
[02:20:23.991 --> 02:20:30.576]  Storable foods are essential, but you also need to make sure you have the nutrients you need to stay healthy during emergencies.
[02:20:30.576 --> 02:20:38.282]  Go to SurvivalRx.com today and see the amazing line of storable supplements they have to protect the ones you love.
[02:20:38.282 --> 02:20:47.089]  The owners of SurvivalRx.com have been in sports nutrition for over a decade and they realize the need for long-term storable vitamins.
[02:20:47.509 --> 02:20:53.879]  The result is a triple nitrogen flushing method which allows these vitamins to maintain their strength for decades.
[02:20:53.879 --> 02:20:57.064]  Again, go to survivalrx.com.
[02:20:57.064 --> 02:20:59.027]  That's survivalrx.com.
[02:21:00.899 --> 02:21:02.480]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:21:02.480 --> 02:21:05.944]  You all know I've worked for years with Steve Shank and eFoods Direct.
[02:21:05.944 --> 02:21:08.526]  I have eFoods for my own emergency food supply.
[02:21:08.526 --> 02:21:11.589]  You know, Steve, life is different now for all of us, isn't it?
[02:21:11.589 --> 02:21:12.389]  Very different.
[02:21:12.389 --> 02:21:22.358]  People are using this great food to survive the present hurricane season, and we've already had $40 billion worth of damage from floods, storms, quakes, and droughts.
[02:21:22.358 --> 02:21:24.340]  And that's just the first eight months of this year.
[02:21:24.580 --> 02:21:28.723]  Natural disasters are newsworthy, but only touch a few of us Americans.
[02:21:28.723 --> 02:21:32.386]  The huge issue of the greatest depression is on everyone's mind.
[02:21:32.386 --> 02:21:38.751]  The unemployment, the loss of homes, lost businesses and skyrocketing food costs are hitting every American.

[02:22:00.931 --> 02:22:02.232]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:22:02.232 --> 02:22:07.815]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:22:07.815 --> 02:22:12.839]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:22:12.839 --> 02:22:13.319]  It's true.
[02:22:13.319 --> 02:22:16.121]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[02:22:16.121 --> 02:22:17.882]  And it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:22:18.402 --> 02:22:23.628]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:22:23.628 --> 02:22:30.736]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:22:30.736 --> 02:22:31.857]  And here's the best part.
[02:22:31.857 --> 02:22:38.224]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:22:38.544 --> 02:22:41.726]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:22:41.726 --> 02:22:43.947]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[02:22:44.888 --> 02:22:45.288]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:22:45.288 --> 02:22:48.530]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:22:48.530 --> 02:22:50.250]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

[02:24:27.202 --> 02:24:28.022]  The tip of the spear.
[02:24:28.022 --> 02:24:30.764]  But that's not enough.
[02:24:31.772 --> 02:24:33.393]  We only live once.
[02:24:33.393 --> 02:24:34.393]  Tyranny is upon us.
[02:24:34.393 --> 02:24:38.934]  So we've hit our afterburners.
[02:24:38.934 --> 02:24:41.575]  Monday through Friday, 7 p.m.
[02:24:41.575 --> 02:24:42.716]  Central, 8 p.m.

[02:24:46.037 --> 02:24:51.719]  It was an hour and a half long last night.
[02:24:51.719 --> 02:24:56.961]  With the broker that went public in some Goldman Sachs rule of the world that got all the attention.
[02:24:56.961 --> 02:24:59.302]  He was on with us for an extended interview.
[02:24:59.302 --> 02:25:00.022]  Max Keiser.
[02:25:01.155 --> 02:25:11.082]  We had a special report as well getting into what's going on at the Denver International Airport and a lot more last night.
[02:25:11.082 --> 02:25:13.304]  We've got a lot coming up this evening as well.
[02:25:13.304 --> 02:25:15.225]  So much, I won't even get into it today.
[02:25:15.225 --> 02:25:18.888]  We'll just be live tonight, 7 o'clock central.
[02:25:18.888 --> 02:25:26.294]  If you are not a PrisonPlanet.tv member, now is the time to become one so we can fund this operation and expand it.
[02:25:27.185 --> 02:25:34.033]  We are doing grievous damage to the globalist and we only intend to do more thanks to your support.
[02:25:34.033 --> 02:25:37.257]  I'm going to give the Herman Cain stuff for the next segment, I promise, and then the calls after that.
[02:25:37.257 --> 02:25:40.100]  But Carla in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[02:25:40.100 --> 02:25:42.042]  Welcome.
[02:25:42.042 --> 02:25:42.823]  Hi, Alex.
[02:25:42.823 --> 02:25:45.587]  I really appreciate your show and you
[02:25:51.140 --> 02:25:58.345]  You appreciate our Bolshevikism because we don't support carbon taxes or socialist health care or gun control.
[02:25:58.345 --> 02:25:59.446]  We don't support Mitt Romney.
[02:25:59.446 --> 02:26:01.367]  You support our extreme Bolshevism.
[02:26:02.898 --> 02:26:09.005]  Yes, um, and I've been watching your show for about, um, I'd say about a year now.
[02:26:09.005 --> 02:26:13.450]  The first documentary I've ever watched was Endgame that you made.
[02:26:13.450 --> 02:26:14.331]  Yes.
[02:26:14.331 --> 02:26:20.297]  And, you know, the whole entire process, like, it didn't take me...
[02:26:21.545 --> 02:26:24.028]  Like, I'm like, is this actually true?
[02:26:24.028 --> 02:26:35.724]  And I'm like, you know, I'm guessing myself, or I'm guessing you, but just here, like, within your... Well, actually, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, Endgame is actually not true.
[02:26:37.665 --> 02:26:40.246]  Because it's much worse.
[02:26:40.246 --> 02:26:48.648]  Frankly, I look at my older films and now I know so much more that they're almost like whitewashes.
[02:26:48.648 --> 02:26:52.089]  So yes, Endgame is true and then some.
[02:26:52.089 --> 02:26:55.710]  But to a point of, is skim milk really milk?
[02:26:55.710 --> 02:26:57.831]  And maybe it's good that it's not.
[02:26:57.831 --> 02:26:59.831]  It seems super hardcore.
[02:26:59.831 --> 02:27:02.132]  Very frightening, very horrifying, very evil.
[02:27:03.072 --> 02:27:11.196]  If what I say in the film is true, and it is, and then some, like A Million Light Years, some.
[02:27:11.196 --> 02:27:16.118]  I mean, Faster Than Light, you know, movie series.
[02:27:16.118 --> 02:27:21.500]  But again, it's like skim milk compared to cream or churned butter.
[02:27:21.500 --> 02:27:24.541]  I mean, it's so much more real than I even say.
[02:27:24.541 --> 02:27:28.883]  But you were saying you were wondering if it was real and then what happened?
[02:27:28.883 --> 02:27:30.184]  Then, you know, I just
[02:27:31.338 --> 02:27:45.585]  I found out who you were and I just turned in...I went to YouTube and InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and you know, I'm like, wow!
[02:27:45.585 --> 02:27:52.348]  And God's just been working through you guys to give us the information that we need so we can stop
[02:27:53.277 --> 02:27:53.517]  Sure.
[02:28:23.627 --> 02:28:37.552]  Nearby me, and she got a business going, and a cop came to her door saying that she can no longer live here.
[02:28:37.552 --> 02:28:43.595]  And she just... They took her to a nut reward, and they had a...
[02:28:50.069 --> 02:28:55.355]  I'm not understanding exactly what you're saying.
[02:28:55.355 --> 02:28:59.580]  Your friend had a business, the police showed up and they told her to leave, stay.
[02:28:59.580 --> 02:29:00.601]  What are the police doing here?
[02:29:07.365 --> 02:29:11.948]  Well yeah, Bank of America and others take thousands of homes they never even had a deed to.
[02:29:11.948 --> 02:29:12.329]  Was that it?
[02:29:12.329 --> 02:29:15.911]  Because the cops do show up now and just say, get out of your house, you've owned for 10 years.
[02:29:15.911 --> 02:29:16.751]  You go, I totally own it.
[02:29:16.751 --> 02:29:18.633]  They just pull out the gun and say, we're here.
[02:29:18.633 --> 02:29:20.074]  The government rules you.
[02:29:20.074 --> 02:29:22.435]  Bank of America's our God.
[02:29:22.435 --> 02:29:26.798]  Now, some of that's been reversed, but I mean, is that what happened to her?
[02:29:26.798 --> 02:29:28.679]  Yeah, pretty much, yeah.
[02:29:28.679 --> 02:29:30.581]  Howard Hannah, it was through them.
[02:29:33.385 --> 02:29:36.507]  It's just a terrible scenario because... Well listen, send me some info.
[02:29:36.507 --> 02:29:37.368]  Email me some info.
[02:29:37.368 --> 02:29:38.429]  Good to hear from you.
[02:29:38.429 --> 02:29:41.211]  Alright, I'm gonna come back, get into some news.
[02:29:41.211 --> 02:29:43.332]  People perish for lack of knowledge.
[02:29:43.332 --> 02:29:46.475]  We have a narcotics trafficking, murdering government.
[02:29:46.475 --> 02:29:47.456]  It's illegitimate.
[02:29:47.456 --> 02:29:48.496]  It's a joke.
[02:29:48.496 --> 02:29:49.617]  They're crooks.
[02:29:49.617 --> 02:29:50.498]  Period.
[02:29:50.498 --> 02:29:51.899]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.899 --> 02:29:54.421]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.421 --> 02:29:57.083]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.590 --> 02:30:08.255]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:30:08.255 --> 02:30:13.399]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:30:13.399 --> 02:30:28.150]  There's a place down in Tennessee Where they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit
[02:30:30.615 --> 02:30:35.198]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[02:30:35.198 --> 02:30:39.041]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[02:30:39.041 --> 02:30:40.262]  Others don't.
[02:30:40.262 --> 02:30:42.423]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:30:42.423 --> 02:30:44.205]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.

[02:31:15.607 --> 02:31:22.790]  But did you know that this dehydrated food also protects you against food-borne contaminants like E. coli and Salmonella?
[02:31:22.990 --> 02:31:27.111]  Those poisonous critters can't live in low-moisture food from eFoodsDirect.
[02:31:27.111 --> 02:31:29.451]  Ask for the Alex Fall Special.

[02:31:58.539 --> 02:32:17.074]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[02:32:17.074 --> 02:32:20.757]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:32:21.758 --> 02:32:34.530]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:32:34.530 --> 02:32:41.797]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[02:32:42.478 --> 02:32:52.869]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[02:32:52.869 --> 02:32:56.793]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[02:32:56.793 --> 02:32:59.896]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:33:16.977 --> 02:33:29.905]  You know, if people are tired of the same old, same old, and more and more liberties being lost, more and more freedom being destroyed, our economy disappearing, well, what do you think the wages of corruption are?
[02:33:29.905 --> 02:33:31.286]  It's enslavement.
[02:33:31.286 --> 02:33:33.347]  It's degradation.
[02:33:33.347 --> 02:33:36.329]  And that's all that's happening right now.
[02:33:36.329 --> 02:33:44.494]  That's basically what we're dealing with here as a society.
[02:33:44.494 --> 02:33:45.155]  We are dealing
[02:33:48.271 --> 02:34:17.446]  With a group of people raised from the time their children in front of the television set, that the government cares about us, that the system wants to take good care of us, you're bombarded by all these TV ads and billboards about the government wants you to wear a seatbelt because they care about you, and the government wants you to call poison control if there's a problem, and the government loves you, and the government's the good guy, and now, right out of The Running Man, you know, Stephen King novel about the police state,
[02:34:18.462 --> 02:34:26.570]  Where there's billboards up saying don't trust your neighbors, nighttime curfew, you can be permanently detained, no judge, no jury.
[02:34:26.570 --> 02:34:29.633]  All of that is actually now manifesting.
[02:34:29.633 --> 02:34:35.118]  We are going into the long, dark, horrible night of classical tyranny.
[02:34:35.118 --> 02:34:40.844]  The globalists have taken every form of tyranny and homogenized it and then put an icing over it of high-tech control.
[02:34:43.792 --> 02:34:57.674]  And we have just been raised, I mean, these people are going to the government, the same government run by the megacorporations, that's totally cheating us, robbing us blind seven ways to Sunday, and then people are begging it to help them, begging it to give them something.
[02:34:57.674 --> 02:35:08.456]  The only hope we have as a society is to get government and the megacorporations that have taken on government power out of our lives.
[02:35:08.456 --> 02:35:11.797]  We're now entering the final phase
[02:35:13.272 --> 02:35:25.216]  of power structure consolidation where the private mega banks are actually enthroning themselves with government power over countries they sold fraudulent debt and imploded.
[02:35:25.216 --> 02:35:31.178]  See, instead of going to prison, they're so bold they become rulers.
[02:35:31.178 --> 02:35:34.739]  And there is a man who was a regional governor
[02:35:35.911 --> 02:35:44.837]  Of the true private corporate world government, the central private bank system, known as the Federal Reserve here in the United States.
[02:35:44.837 --> 02:35:46.858]  Same thing in England, same thing in Europe.
[02:35:46.858 --> 02:35:48.699]  Same thing in Australia and New Zealand.
[02:35:48.699 --> 02:35:55.444]  Same system, where for a dollar to be created, a dollar of debt is created on you and your family's backs.
[02:35:55.444 --> 02:35:59.867]  Instead of money being a symbol of exchange to speed commerce and the economy,
[02:36:00.922 --> 02:36:05.784]  It becomes a system of enslavement that mathematically you can't pay back.
[02:36:05.784 --> 02:36:07.505]  It's a fraudulent debt instrument.
[02:36:07.505 --> 02:36:20.451]  It's a toxic debt asset that only has value because you're assigned to it as a debtor, and then the globalists trade you as a debt slave around like monopoly money.
[02:36:20.451 --> 02:36:26.474]  And then here's Herman Cain riding in, and we're getting these compilations together, him on the campaign trail.
[02:36:27.500 --> 02:36:31.341]  We're going to do a lot of specials on this now, because he's the main guy to go after along with Mitt Romney.
[02:36:31.341 --> 02:36:33.802]  We've exposed, to a certain extent, Rick Perry.
[02:36:33.802 --> 02:36:38.183]  He's on fire, crashing and burning right now if we keep the heat on him.
[02:36:38.183 --> 02:36:39.463]  Who would say the Federal Reserve?
[02:36:39.463 --> 02:36:40.423]  I'm not going to talk about that.
[02:36:40.423 --> 02:36:42.324]  I'm not going to talk about conspiracy theories.
[02:36:42.324 --> 02:36:45.104]  Again, their answer is, I don't like your monetary policy.
[02:36:45.104 --> 02:36:47.265]  I don't listen to conspiracy theories.
[02:36:47.265 --> 02:36:50.185]  See, it used to, they said, didn't even exist.
[02:36:50.185 --> 02:36:52.886]  Then they said it was federal, and you were a conspiracy theorist.
[02:36:52.886 --> 02:36:56.347]  Now, if you don't like their policy, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[02:36:57.793 --> 02:36:59.334]  But it doesn't work anymore.
[02:36:59.334 --> 02:37:05.499]  So now Herman Cain has been running around saying he wants to audit the Fed to make it better.
[02:37:05.499 --> 02:37:11.003]  Now just a few months ago, before it even officially announced, he was running around.
[02:37:11.003 --> 02:37:14.065]  You can see these YouTube videos everywhere saying, I think it's great.
[02:37:14.065 --> 02:37:14.926]  I think it's wonderful.
[02:37:14.926 --> 02:37:20.970]  He also said in a clip coming up that Alan Greenspan was the best guy ever at the Fed.
[02:37:20.970 --> 02:37:23.312]  That's the literal architect.
[02:37:24.375 --> 02:37:28.077]  Of getting rid of Glass-Steagall, the derivatives, the fraud.
[02:37:28.077 --> 02:37:32.058]  It's the guy that told the President to appoint Bernanke.
[02:37:32.058 --> 02:37:33.579]  Told Bush to appoint Bernanke.
[02:37:33.579 --> 02:37:38.441]  His hair and Kane's like, I don't like Bernanke, but I like that Alan Greenspan.
[02:37:38.441 --> 02:37:38.821]  What?
[02:37:38.821 --> 02:37:49.526]  That's like saying, I don't like, I don't like Stalin, but I sure like Lenin.
[02:37:49.526 --> 02:37:50.206]  I don't like
[02:37:51.991 --> 02:37:56.155]  Herman Goering, but I sure like that Hitler.
[02:37:56.155 --> 02:38:05.504]  I don't like... I don't like Rudolph, but I sure like Santa Claus.
[02:38:05.504 --> 02:38:12.931]  The architect of this current fraud, the guy running it, the guy that got rid of Glass-Steagall, did it all, is Alan Greenspan.
[02:38:14.557 --> 02:38:20.321]  And here's Herman Cain saying, we did a great job in the 90s when I was the chairman of the Kansas City Fed.
[02:38:20.321 --> 02:38:21.342]  I think it's really good.
[02:38:21.342 --> 02:38:25.325]  And I've got some people I want to appoint, but that's secret.
[02:38:25.325 --> 02:38:34.892]  And Ron Paul, like the old owl, looks at him, wise owl, and says, oh, spoken like a true insider.
[02:38:34.892 --> 02:38:40.576]  Look, I'm going to go to John listing on 1310 AM Sunshine Network up in upstate New York.
[02:38:40.576 --> 02:38:43.359]  I guess it's over by Rochester, a great affiliate now of 12 years.
[02:38:45.393 --> 02:38:46.934]  And others that are patiently holding.
[02:38:46.934 --> 02:38:49.295]  But I want to go to these clips right now.
[02:38:49.295 --> 02:38:51.956]  Again, this first clip is, and this is only one piece.
[02:38:51.956 --> 02:39:06.424]  In Paul Watson's article, he has links to other examples, and a link to the page from Herman Cain's book, where he called anyone, he called Ron Paul supporters, quote, ignorant and stupid in his book.
[02:39:06.424 --> 02:39:12.747]  And we have a link to it in our article to his actual book, where he says,
[02:39:14.185 --> 02:39:20.387]  And, I mean, I've heard Neil Bortz for years, which is like the minion of Kane.
[02:39:20.387 --> 02:39:29.690]  Make fun of me, say I'm a liar, Northwoods doesn't exist, the Federal Reserve is great.
[02:39:29.690 --> 02:39:30.870]  I'm a conspiracy theorist.
[02:39:30.870 --> 02:39:33.851]  I mean, we've got to find this, like, five years ago, because somebody called Bortz.
[02:39:33.851 --> 02:39:35.512]  I rarely listen, but he's on locally.
[02:39:35.512 --> 02:39:37.712]  I hear it sometimes.
[02:39:37.712 --> 02:39:42.834]  And I heard him, like, two weeks ago go, a person called and they said, Neil, you used to criticize people.
[02:39:44.053 --> 02:39:46.495]  That was me, but the caller didn't mention that.
[02:39:46.495 --> 02:39:55.604]  Who said that you're pushing the fair tax, but when it came time you wouldn't get rid of the income tax, you'd keep the income tax and have a VAT and a sales tax.
[02:39:55.604 --> 02:40:00.509]  And they're gonna keep FICA too, so it's really 9-9-9-9 to begin.
[02:40:00.509 --> 02:40:04.253]  And Bortz is like, well, well, Herman's gotta get elected, you know, we gotta compromise.
[02:40:05.950 --> 02:40:08.451]  I mean, I heard boards without ever even listening.
[02:40:08.451 --> 02:40:11.151]  I'd randomly, I might listen every two weeks.
[02:40:11.151 --> 02:40:17.593]  I tuned in four or five years ago and he was going, this Alex Jones kook says we're going to keep the income tax on top of it.
[02:40:17.593 --> 02:40:24.035]  He's a, that guy's a nut and a lunatic and a blah, blah, blah.
[02:40:24.035 --> 02:40:24.995]  And then here they are.
[02:40:24.995 --> 02:40:27.156]  Nine, nine, nine, nine.
[02:40:30.225 --> 02:40:35.709]  FICA, Social Security garbage, income tax, VAT, sales tax.
[02:40:35.709 --> 02:40:43.474]  He says he only wants the income tax, VAT, and sales with federal control over everything.
[02:40:43.474 --> 02:40:45.495]  I mean, and then they're going to start jacking that up.
[02:40:45.495 --> 02:40:49.477]  This is what the Federal Reserve in the last few years has called for, is a VAT.
[02:40:49.477 --> 02:40:51.179]  The CFR has called for it.
[02:40:51.179 --> 02:40:52.619]  This is what they're doing in Europe.
[02:40:52.619 --> 02:40:54.621]  This is more money to them.
[02:40:54.621 --> 02:40:57.943]  The Federal Reserve took over in 1913 and got the income tax through.
[02:41:02.631 --> 02:41:12.396]  And only in America would idiot Republicans, idiots, anyone that's supporting Herman Cain or Mitt Romney or Rick Perry are certified morons.
[02:41:12.396 --> 02:41:26.284]  Just like you moron Obama supporters, totally financed by the most corrupt elements of Wall Street, and now he says he embraces organize the Occupy Wall Street thing as the, I mean, it's total sham.
[02:41:26.284 --> 02:41:31.407]  It's like if you're against serial killers, but you want to, you know, worship Jeffrey Dahmer.
[02:41:33.257 --> 02:41:40.543]  I mean, it's just, it's like saying you're afraid of dogs, so you go to the pet store and get 15 dogs to bring home with you.
[02:41:40.543 --> 02:41:46.748]  I mean, it's just, it's pure lunacy.
[02:41:46.748 --> 02:41:50.511]  Just like this Herman Cain clip.
[02:41:52.102 --> 02:41:58.268]  And the clip that we've got in our story then has some text in between before it cuts to Herman Cain filling in for Neil Boards.
[02:41:58.268 --> 02:42:02.213]  And this is just one of the mild ones where, you know, he's whitewashing things.
[02:42:02.213 --> 02:42:06.076]  We're digging up a lot of other ones before I go back to your calls.
[02:42:06.076 --> 02:42:07.698]  Let's go ahead and go to this first clip.
[02:42:07.698 --> 02:42:09.140]  Here's Herman Cain caught
[02:42:09.620 --> 02:42:16.909]  In a brazen debate lie, get the article at InfoWars.com, it's titled, Fed Insider Cain Caught in Brazen Debate Lie.
[02:42:16.909 --> 02:42:24.498]  Even if you like the Federal Reserve, maybe you like Obamacare, and you like gun control, and you like carbon taxes like Mitt Romney does.
[02:42:24.498 --> 02:42:27.641]  And maybe you like the Federal Reserve financially gang raping you.
[02:42:27.641 --> 02:42:29.063]  He lied about it though.
[02:42:29.063 --> 02:42:29.464]  Here it is.
[02:42:31.454 --> 02:42:41.477]  Since the Federal Reserve is the engine of inflation, creates the business cycle, produces our recessions and our depressions, the Federal Reserve obviously is a very important issue.
[02:42:41.477 --> 02:42:48.679]  And fortunately tonight we have a former director of the Federal Reserve at Kansas City.
[02:42:48.679 --> 02:42:50.700]  So I have a question for Mr. Kane.
[02:42:51.620 --> 02:42:57.483]  Uh, Mr. Cain, uh, in the past you've been rather critical of any of us who would want to audit the Fed.
[02:42:57.483 --> 02:43:06.727]  You said, uh, you've used pretty strong terms, uh, that, uh, uh, we were ignorant, and that, uh, we didn't know what we were doing.
[02:43:06.727 --> 02:43:15.070]  And therefore, there was no need for a Fed audit anyway, because if you had one, you're not gonna find out everything, because everybody knows everything about the Fed.
[02:43:15.070 --> 02:43:20.673]  But now that we have found and we've gotten an audit, we have found out an awful lot on how special businesses get
[02:43:21.133 --> 02:43:22.354]  It's higher than that, Mr. King.
[02:43:48.809 --> 02:43:51.511]  First of all, you have misquoted me.
[02:43:51.511 --> 02:43:54.734]  I did not call you, or any of your people, ignorant.
[02:43:54.734 --> 02:43:56.515]  I don't know where that came from.
[02:43:56.515 --> 02:43:57.035]  Alright?
[02:43:57.035 --> 02:44:02.719]  Now, so, you gotta be careful of the stuff that you get off the internet, because that's just not something that I have said.
[02:44:02.719 --> 02:44:04.521]  Head pause!
[02:44:04.521 --> 02:44:07.223]  Head pause, back it up a few seconds.
[02:44:07.223 --> 02:44:12.347]  We have direct links to him calling them ignorant, and worse still, in his own book, stupid.
[02:44:13.266 --> 02:44:16.548]  And all day, Dew's back there getting clips of this.
[02:44:16.548 --> 02:44:21.312]  We've got links to it in his book and a clip of him coming up saying we don't need to audit the Fed.
[02:44:21.312 --> 02:44:26.035]  But I mean, again, a little joke about you need to stop getting that stuff off the Internet.
[02:44:26.035 --> 02:44:28.797]  You mean actual video and audio clips of you?
[02:44:28.797 --> 02:44:30.739]  Talking to the whole world?
[02:44:30.739 --> 02:44:31.699]  Talking to millions of people?
[02:44:31.699 --> 02:44:33.100]  You mean like those?
[02:44:33.100 --> 02:44:35.602]  He is counting on people as a confidence man.
[02:44:37.043 --> 02:44:41.805]  No, and you need to start getting that stuff off the internet.
[02:44:41.805 --> 02:44:44.266]  Which is another way of saying conspiracy theory.
[02:44:44.266 --> 02:44:47.127]  And then Ron Paul goes, okay, I'll check into that.
[02:44:47.127 --> 02:44:49.568]  You know there's going to be a campaign ad.
[02:44:49.568 --> 02:44:55.170]  You know there's going to be a campaign ad showing Herman Cain lying.
[02:44:55.170 --> 02:44:58.052]  But it's how good he lies.
[02:44:58.052 --> 02:44:59.472]  I mean, he doesn't just say that's not true.
[02:44:59.472 --> 02:45:02.854]  He accuses Ron Paul and says, get your facts straight.
[02:45:02.854 --> 02:45:03.554]  Let's go back to it.
[02:45:04.716 --> 02:45:05.096]  I hope so.
[02:45:19.844 --> 02:45:23.127]  We didn't do any of the things that this fellow reserve is doing.
[02:45:23.127 --> 02:45:25.369]  I don't agree with the actions of this fellow reserve.
[02:45:25.369 --> 02:45:29.113]  I don't agree with the actions that have been undertaken by Ben Bernanke.
[02:45:29.113 --> 02:45:34.958]  We didn't have a 14 trillion dollar national debt to prop up with some of the actions that they are taking.
[02:45:34.958 --> 02:45:39.342]  And I have also said, to be precise, I do not object
[02:45:39.682 --> 02:45:40.122]  Yeah, new taxes.
[02:46:08.223 --> 02:46:18.263]  In July 2011, a partial audit of the Federal Reserve, as authorized by Congress, revealed an unprecedented $16.1 trillion, it's actually more than that, in unreported loans to U.S.
[02:46:18.263 --> 02:46:20.006]  financial institutions and private individuals.
[02:46:22.169 --> 02:46:26.391]  In 2010, Herman Cain flatly denied the need for an audit.
[02:46:26.391 --> 02:46:34.754]  Herman Cain served as deputy chairman from 1994 and as chairman from... Some people say that we ought to audit the Federal Reserve.
[02:46:34.754 --> 02:46:36.294]  Here's what I do know.
[02:46:36.294 --> 02:46:41.956]  The Federal Reserve already has so many internal audits, it's ridiculous.
[02:46:41.956 --> 02:46:43.857]  I don't know why people think
[02:46:44.477 --> 02:46:49.040]  We're going to learn this great amount of information by auditing the Federal Reserve.
[02:47:07.028 --> 02:47:08.348]  That we're not going to learn anything.
[02:47:08.348 --> 02:47:09.889]  We're not going to learn anything.
[02:47:09.889 --> 02:47:10.889]  You don't want to look in there.
[02:47:10.889 --> 02:47:15.371]  And then we find out it's 16 plus trillion dollars.
[02:47:15.371 --> 02:47:17.892]  And growing.
[02:47:17.892 --> 02:47:22.473]  That's with a little tiny congressional audit that didn't even scratch the surface.
[02:47:22.473 --> 02:47:26.694]  So we went and dug in one spot in the backyard and found a bunch of bodies.
[02:47:26.694 --> 02:47:28.755]  Should we keep digging?
[02:47:28.755 --> 02:47:30.476]  Herman Cain's like, you don't need to dig.
[02:47:30.476 --> 02:47:31.396]  You don't need to dig.
[02:47:31.396 --> 02:47:34.157]  Now that the digging's begun, he's like, I always said dig.
[02:47:36.735 --> 02:47:39.417]  And how dare you, Ron Paul, said I called you stupid!
[02:47:39.417 --> 02:47:41.159]  I just printed it in the book!
[02:47:41.159 --> 02:47:44.562]  There's all these clips of me saying it, how dare you!
[02:47:44.562 --> 02:47:46.583]  Getting that stuff on the internet!
[02:47:46.583 --> 02:47:52.769]  And Ron Paul kind of raises an eyebrow and goes, okay, here comes the campaign ad.
[02:47:52.769 --> 02:47:55.631]  Ron Paul doesn't say something unless he's triple checked it.
[02:47:55.631 --> 02:47:58.974]  That guy is a complete workaholic, the likes of which I've never seen.
[02:47:58.974 --> 02:47:59.875]  Let's go back to the clip.
[02:48:00.629 --> 02:48:03.990]  Some people say that we ought to audit the Federal Reserve.
[02:48:03.990 --> 02:48:05.530]  Here's what I do know.
[02:48:05.530 --> 02:48:11.191]  The Federal Reserve already has so many internal audits, it's ridiculous.
[02:48:11.191 --> 02:48:19.133]  I don't know why people think we're going to learn this great amount of information by auditing the Federal Reserve.
[02:48:19.133 --> 02:48:25.194]  I think a lot of people are calling for this audit of the Federal Reserve because they don't know enough about it.
[02:48:26.380 --> 02:48:31.227]  There's no hidden secrets going on in the Federal Reserve to my knowledge.
[02:48:31.227 --> 02:48:35.232]  And I tell people, you know, we've got 12 Federal Reserve Banks.
[02:48:35.232 --> 02:48:37.455]  Find out which district you're in.
[02:48:37.455 --> 02:48:38.877]  Call them up and go from there!
[02:48:40.054 --> 02:48:43.596]  We don't need to waste money with another... That's enough.
[02:48:43.596 --> 02:48:51.239]  I can't listen to the Neil Bortz bumper music, selling these idiot mainline conservatives and new tax systems on top of the income tax.
[02:48:51.239 --> 02:48:53.901]  I told you, but being right means I'm bad.
[02:48:53.901 --> 02:49:01.524]  Let's go to break with the next clip, where they ask Herman Cain, who would you hire at the Federal Reserve as a new person?
[02:49:01.524 --> 02:49:01.865]  He says,
[02:49:02.785 --> 02:49:05.267]  Alan Greenspan, because he didn't get us into this mess.
[02:49:05.267 --> 02:49:08.188]  That's literally who wrote this mess.
[02:49:08.188 --> 02:49:12.431]  That was the captain at the ship that ran into the iceberg.
[02:49:12.431 --> 02:49:15.253]  A few miles down the road, we're sinking.
[02:49:15.253 --> 02:49:17.354]  Here's a clip.
[02:49:17.354 --> 02:49:18.495]  Alan Greenspan.
[02:49:18.495 --> 02:49:19.175]  Why?
[02:49:19.175 --> 02:49:24.599]  Because that's when I served on the board of the Federal Reserve in the early 1990s.
[02:49:24.599 --> 02:49:31.583]  And the way Alan Greenspan oversaw the Fed and the way he coordinated with
[02:49:32.432 --> 02:49:39.918]  The way he coordinated with all of the Federal Reserve Banks, I think that it worked fine back in the early 1990s.
[02:49:39.918 --> 02:49:53.949]  Now, on that same point, I have already identified two candidates which I cannot give their names to replace Mr. Bernanke in anticipation of having that responsibility.
[02:49:53.949 --> 02:49:56.992]  We must narrow the mission of the Fed first.
[02:49:57.632 --> 02:49:59.693]  I don't believe in ending the Fed.
[02:49:59.693 --> 02:50:09.175]  I believe we can fix the Fed by getting that mission refocused on monetary price stability, and I have candidates in mind that will help us do that.
[02:50:09.175 --> 02:50:15.496]  So you have two appointments waiting in the wings for 2013, when his term is up, 2014?
[02:50:15.496 --> 02:50:18.297]  Yes, I have two candidates waiting in the wings.
[02:50:18.297 --> 02:50:19.357]  How about a hen?
[02:50:19.357 --> 02:50:21.297]  To take that job.
[02:50:21.297 --> 02:50:22.778]  I've got to keep them confidential.
[02:50:22.778 --> 02:50:23.878]  OK, Congressman Paul?
[02:50:27.352 --> 02:50:30.435]  Spoken like a true insider.
[02:50:30.435 --> 02:50:31.436]  Um, no.
[02:50:31.436 --> 02:50:33.698]  Alright, that's it.
[02:50:33.698 --> 02:50:35.340]  Yeah, Greenspan was a disaster.
[02:50:35.340 --> 02:50:40.304]  I mean, Herman Cain, I mean, what a lying con artist.
[02:50:40.304 --> 02:50:43.987]  You wait till tonight on the TV show, we're gonna have even more of this.
[02:50:43.987 --> 02:50:47.871]  And the shots from his book where he's calling us stupid and ignorant and Ron Paul.
[02:50:47.871 --> 02:50:49.993]  And then looking at Ron Paul saying, I didn't say that!
[02:50:52.793 --> 02:50:54.314]  What, did you not write your book, Kane?
[02:50:54.314 --> 02:50:59.355]  I mean, is that not you talking on the radio and TV?
[02:50:59.355 --> 02:51:01.476]  No, you think we're stupid, don't you?
[02:51:01.476 --> 02:51:03.997]  Big Berkey water filters are in high demand.
[02:51:03.997 --> 02:51:06.058]  Storable foods are also in high demand.

[02:52:02.392 --> 02:52:07.096]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[02:52:07.096 --> 02:52:13.521]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[02:52:13.521 --> 02:52:15.803]  Number one, study the past.
[02:52:15.803 --> 02:52:18.185]  History really does repeat itself.
[02:52:18.185 --> 02:52:21.907]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[02:52:23.041 --> 02:52:26.123]  Number three, take decisive action.
[02:52:26.123 --> 02:52:29.966]  A perfect storm is brewing for a global food crisis.
[02:52:29.966 --> 02:52:39.012]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves, warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[02:52:39.012 --> 02:52:42.434]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[02:52:42.434 --> 02:52:46.317]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:52:46.917 --> 02:52:51.843]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.

[02:53:01.354 --> 02:53:05.439]  Life Before the Collapse, Final LP by The Lost Vegas.
[02:53:37.472 --> 02:53:39.193]  Life Before the Collapse.
[02:53:39.193 --> 02:53:40.474]  Vinyl LP.
[02:53:40.474 --> 02:53:44.457]  By The Lost Vegas.
[02:53:44.457 --> 02:53:45.959]  Life Before the Collapse.
[02:53:45.959 --> 02:53:47.340]  By The Lost Vegas.
[02:53:47.340 --> 02:53:51.863]  Oh yeah!
[02:53:51.863 --> 02:53:53.304]  On 180 gram vinyl.
[02:53:53.304 --> 02:53:57.448]  And mastered especially for vinyl by legendary audio engineer Steve Hall.
[02:53:57.448 --> 02:53:59.069]  Now available at Amazon.com.
[02:54:30.345 --> 02:54:43.569]  Coming up tonight, my friends, we are going to have shots from his book where he called Ron Paul supporters ignorant and stupid on the nightly news.
[02:54:43.569 --> 02:54:44.990]  And then he just says, I didn't say that.
[02:54:44.990 --> 02:54:49.031]  I mean, it's as big a hoax.
[02:54:51.400 --> 02:55:05.069]  As Mitt Romney being for gun control, I mean serious gun control, carbon taxes to the point of being praised by Al Gore, wrote the healthcare bill that's Obamacare, and he's arguably the frontrunner.
[02:55:05.069 --> 02:55:17.598]  And the other major frontrunner is Herman Cain, a slick corporate general running around, running the Federal Reserve, the absolute enemy of this country.
[02:55:21.809 --> 02:55:25.552]  I don't know who's stupider, who's more gullible.
[02:55:25.552 --> 02:55:28.433]  Obama supporters or mainline Republicans?
[02:55:28.433 --> 02:55:29.834]  I really don't know sometimes.
[02:55:29.834 --> 02:55:35.678]  Because Democrats, you know, they think they're going to get something free from government.
[02:55:35.678 --> 02:55:41.202]  They think that government can be made to be good and redistribute wealth.
[02:55:44.175 --> 02:55:54.681]  But Republicans claim they're smart enough to understand collectivism doesn't work and creates horrors in every instance, but then they run to collectivist.
[02:55:54.681 --> 02:55:55.422]  I mean, I just...
[02:56:01.055 --> 02:56:01.896]  Like you idiots!
[02:56:01.896 --> 02:56:09.100]  And I'm talking about people that aren't my regular listeners, who've attacked me in the news months ago, a year ago, when I was telling you about Rick Perry, and now it's all come out!
[02:56:09.100 --> 02:56:11.441]  I mean, do you think I just get up here and lie?
[02:56:11.441 --> 02:56:15.183]  I make occasional mistakes, but I'm not trying to lie to you!
[02:56:15.183 --> 02:56:15.944]  That's the difference!
[02:56:16.684 --> 02:56:17.464]  I have a crew in there.
[02:56:17.464 --> 02:56:19.325]  When I make mistakes, tell me about them.
[02:56:19.325 --> 02:56:20.486]  I ask them to correct me.
[02:56:20.486 --> 02:56:22.027]  Because, you know, you do three hours of radio every day.
[02:56:22.027 --> 02:56:23.548]  You're going to mess up sometimes.
[02:56:23.548 --> 02:56:28.490]  But Herman Cain going, I didn't call people stupid, and I do want the Fed audited.
[02:56:28.490 --> 02:56:31.952]  And I don't appreciate you getting that baloney on the Internet about me.
[02:56:31.952 --> 02:56:33.973]  And it's his book!
[02:56:33.973 --> 02:56:35.694]  He's a con artist!
[02:56:35.694 --> 02:56:36.914]  And he's a good liar.
[02:56:36.914 --> 02:56:39.716]  Because when you look at him, you can't tell Herman Cain's lying.
[02:56:39.716 --> 02:56:43.838]  No wonder the Federal Reserve hired him to run an entire four-state division.
[02:56:45.592 --> 02:56:48.794]  Because the guy is a slick liar.
[02:56:48.794 --> 02:56:51.356]  I can look at Bill Clinton and tell you when he's lying.
[02:56:51.356 --> 02:56:52.938]  I can look at George Bush and tell you when he's lying.
[02:56:52.938 --> 02:56:56.180]  Obama, Herman Cain, you think it's true.
[02:56:56.180 --> 02:56:59.643]  I mean, he's, man, that guy's, that guy's devilish.
[02:57:01.591 --> 02:57:04.674]  Let's go ahead and take a call here.
[02:57:04.674 --> 02:57:09.477]  Let's go ahead and go to John in New York at 1310 AM.
[02:57:09.477 --> 02:57:14.961]  That's one of our oldest affiliates up there, part of the Sunshine Network in New York.
[02:57:14.961 --> 02:57:15.922]  Good to have you on, John.
[02:57:15.922 --> 02:57:16.222]  Welcome.
[02:57:16.222 --> 02:57:18.964]  You're our telegunner here on the main show today.
[02:57:18.964 --> 02:57:19.745]  All right, Alex.
[02:57:19.745 --> 02:57:21.506]  I'm in just the right position here, thanks.
[02:57:21.506 --> 02:57:23.688]  I got it really short and sweet here.
[02:57:23.688 --> 02:57:25.349]  I want to take them down with a catchphrase.
[02:57:25.931 --> 02:57:27.711]  It's the Fed, stupid.
[02:57:27.711 --> 02:57:31.292]  And we're not correcting the stupid word at anybody in particular.
[02:57:31.292 --> 02:57:33.832]  It's a generic, you know, it's very generic.
[02:57:33.832 --> 02:57:37.373]  It's constructively criticizing, you know?
[02:57:37.373 --> 02:57:41.014]  It's not, you know, meant to down anybody.
[02:57:41.014 --> 02:57:41.634]  That's it.
[02:57:41.634 --> 02:57:42.894]  It's the Fed, stupid.
[02:57:42.894 --> 02:57:44.934]  You know, it's like, read my lips, no new taxes.
[02:57:44.934 --> 02:57:46.395]  It's the economy, stupid.
[02:57:46.395 --> 02:57:48.915]  It's the Fed, stupid.
[02:57:48.915 --> 02:57:50.876]  Right, right.
[02:57:50.876 --> 02:57:53.236]  It's almost like we're using their weapon against them, you know?
[02:57:54.537 --> 02:57:55.018]  You know what?
[02:57:55.018 --> 02:58:04.589]  I think we should start a website called It's the Fed Stupid or T-Shirts because you had people come up to me who were at the end of the Fed and they go, we know the Fed's bad but why not go after the big banks?
[02:58:04.589 --> 02:58:07.092]  And I'm like, this is the big banks.
[02:58:07.092 --> 02:58:07.692]  This is their...
[02:58:08.686 --> 02:58:15.808]  ...tooled resources to create this fraud in fake government buildings with fake government seals.
[02:58:15.808 --> 02:58:17.408]  It's the shadow government.
[02:58:17.408 --> 02:58:18.368]  They're the globalists.
[02:58:18.368 --> 02:58:19.228]  They're the enemy.
[02:58:19.228 --> 02:58:20.509]  They're the problem.
[02:58:20.509 --> 02:58:24.069]  One man stands against them in the presidential race, Ron Paul.
[02:58:24.069 --> 02:58:25.650]  We stand with him.
[02:58:25.650 --> 02:58:26.830]  Win, lose, or draw.
[02:58:26.830 --> 02:58:30.911]  And then you've got now the new frontrunner, Herman Cain, who was a top general.
[02:58:32.076 --> 02:58:34.578]  Good to hear from you there in 1310 AM land.
[02:58:34.578 --> 02:58:36.299]  Alright, I'm sorry to other callers.
[02:58:36.299 --> 02:58:37.900]  I'll be back tonight at 7 o'clock.
[02:58:37.900 --> 02:58:38.981]  We're back tomorrow.
[02:58:38.981 --> 02:58:39.581]  Stay with us.
[02:58:39.581 --> 02:58:40.142]  God bless you.
