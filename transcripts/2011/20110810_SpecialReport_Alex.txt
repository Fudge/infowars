[00:00:18.376 --> 00:00:18.922]  We're good.
[00:00:57.702 --> 00:01:05.490]  It is Wednesday, August 10, 2011, and you're watching an InfoWars.com breaking news alert.
[00:01:06.291 --> 00:01:13.359]  Coming up later in the broadcast, we're going to be talking to Max Keiser about the 520-point drop in the U.S.
[00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:18.625]  stock market and the plunging stock of mega-zombie bank, Bank of America.
[00:01:19.045 --> 00:01:35.469]  Paul Joseph Watson will also be joining us live via Skype from the United Kingdom to give us the latest on the ongoing riots now entering their fifth day as Parliament prepares to meet to deal with the reported emergency.
[00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:42.891]  We also will get into the fact that it's been confirmed now that the police were ordered to stand down.
[00:01:43.931 --> 00:01:45.572]  But first, I want to get into the economy.
[00:01:46.332 --> 00:01:55.977]  The Federal Reserve, of course, yesterday announced that they're going to continue, at least for the next two years, to have zero percent interest rates for the megabanks, not for the general public.
[00:01:56.377 --> 00:02:01.799]  That, of course, will accelerate the devaluation of the dollar in the world's eyes.
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.642]  And so we saw a massive plunge in the dollar today before the Federal Reserve went in and propped it up.
[00:02:08.062 --> 00:02:10.884]  That did not stop the Dow Jones Industrial Average
[00:02:11.584 --> 00:02:15.687]  From dropping 520 points.
[00:02:16.608 --> 00:02:28.738]  The shockwaves were felt across the world and major banks in France and other EU nations are now reporting that they are teetering on the edge of collapse.
[00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:32.541]  Of course, all of this has been predicted.
[00:02:33.462 --> 00:02:40.248]  By myself and many others that have studied exactly what the large banking cartels are up to.
[00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:43.651]  Everything is going according to their plan.
[00:02:44.592 --> 00:02:50.778]  British government and US government actuaries put out in the last four years predicted that as austerity hit,
[00:02:51.158 --> 00:02:56.904]  There would be more and more rioting and social unrest, especially in the underclass or welfare class.
[00:02:57.345 --> 00:03:04.192]  The police in England have now confirmed to the BBC and others they were ordered to stand down last Sunday.
[00:03:04.792 --> 00:03:09.857]  And only now are they talking about stopping the looters and rioters who are not political.
[00:03:10.538 --> 00:03:12.678]  This is not a political revolution.
[00:03:12.738 --> 00:03:24.420]  You don't see them going up against the City of London within London, where the big mega banks are based, or storming the palaces and castles of the British Royals, who get tens of millions of dollars in welfare every year.
[00:03:24.901 --> 00:03:26.421]  You don't see them going after the Parliament.
[00:03:26.481 --> 00:03:31.982]  No, they're burning third, fourth and fifth generation small family stores, people's homes.
[00:03:32.342 --> 00:03:38.823]  They're carjacking people and running over folks with cars, murdering them, all for the fun of it.
[00:03:39.503 --> 00:03:50.533]  It is the football hooligan type of individual who is simply out there celebrating criminality and wanton abandon.
[00:03:50.933 --> 00:03:55.777]  Most of them have been confirmed as welfare recipients living in government housing.
[00:03:56.198 --> 00:04:04.085]  This is what the social engineers have created and now they're going to use these rioters as a pretext to take the rights of all
[00:04:04.625 --> 00:04:16.530]  People in the UK to even peaceably assemble and there's calls to start shooting any type of demonstrator on site instead of dealing with people engaging in arson, looting and other plunder.
[00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:23.312]  I would also add the British people are not allowed to defend themselves via the Second Amendment.
[00:04:23.352 --> 00:04:24.833]  They don't have a right to defend themselves.
[00:04:25.353 --> 00:04:31.556]  And so they have some of the highest rates of home invasions, robbery, muggings in the world.
[00:04:32.386 --> 00:04:40.191]  Their crime rate has exploded in the last 15 years since the right to keep and bear arms was all but abolished in the UK.
[00:04:40.652 --> 00:04:41.692]  But never fear.
[00:04:42.133 --> 00:04:43.674]  The citizens are banding together.
[00:04:44.194 --> 00:04:48.157]  Muslims, particularly, have been fighting back and defending their stores and property.
[00:04:48.977 --> 00:04:55.782]  We've seen Sikhs, a religious faith based out of India, guarding their homes, businesses and temples.
[00:04:56.182 --> 00:05:00.905]  And the British government has now come to them and said, do not defend your property.
[00:05:01.245 --> 00:05:01.906]  Stand down.
[00:05:02.806 --> 00:05:23.871]  So that the looters can burn you out of house and home and they're refusing But see that's the type of lawlessness the government won't put up with is people lawfully defending themselves That's why we noticed yesterday as did the drudge report today raw story and others picked it up that on amazon.com in the UK there was a 6,500 plus
[00:05:27.012 --> 00:05:34.377]  Increase in sales of aluminum baseball bats and other self-defense items that Brits are able to get.
[00:05:34.397 --> 00:05:49.766]  There was over a 3,000% increase in wooden baseball bat sales and shops across the UK sold out of ball peen hammers, claw hammers, baseball bats and other implements that can be used for people to defend themselves.
[00:05:50.126 --> 00:05:54.768]  The nanny state has become absolutely outraged, calling them wicked vigilantes.
[00:05:55.408 --> 00:06:02.551]  You see, the ruling class needs the welfare class to menace and scare the middle class into giving up their liberties.
[00:06:03.152 --> 00:06:03.832]  Continuing...
[00:06:05.462 --> 00:06:06.523]  with the carnage.
[00:06:07.164 --> 00:06:18.894]  It's reported that tens of millions if not billions of dollars of increases in insurance premiums are set to hit business owners and private homeowners and renters.
[00:06:19.254 --> 00:06:24.719]  The cost will be passed on across the UK as insurance prices spike.
[00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:35.163]  Again, I ask, would the police stand down if these rioters tried to target the Parliament, 10 Downing Street, or the Queen's House, or one of the Rothschild Palaces?
[00:06:35.563 --> 00:06:36.464]  The answer is no.
[00:06:36.684 --> 00:06:38.444]  They would fire live ammo at them.
[00:06:38.765 --> 00:06:42.446]  But see, they're allowed to have troops guarding them with live ammo.
[00:06:42.726 --> 00:06:46.648]  You're not allowed to have a gun in the UK, which is the model
[00:06:47.188 --> 00:06:47.489]  Of course.
[00:06:58.499 --> 00:07:00.240]  To protect their freedom of expression.
[00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:04.162]  That is an actual quote by these people.
[00:07:04.583 --> 00:07:08.845]  Some tweets may facilitate positive change in a repressed country.
[00:07:09.726 --> 00:07:10.806]  Some make us laugh.
[00:07:10.906 --> 00:07:11.787]  Some make us think.
[00:07:12.227 --> 00:07:14.689]  Some downright anger a vast majority of users.
[00:07:15.249 --> 00:07:25.115]  We don't always agree with the things people choose to tweet, but we keep the information flowing, irrespective of any views we may have about the content.
[00:07:25.555 --> 00:07:26.355]  Now, let's be clear.
[00:07:27.055 --> 00:07:34.858]  These are people who are confirmed to be on their Twitter calling for violence or coordinating looting, arson and other criminal activities.
[00:07:35.298 --> 00:07:48.302]  It should be noted that the State Department works closely with Twitter and has used them in the fake revolution in Libya and in the revolution in Egypt to overthrow the old Western-backed dictator Hosni Mubarak.
[00:07:49.102 --> 00:08:01.345]  And so now it's clear that the intelligence agencies are using Twitter not to overthrow the British government, but to do the opposite, to destabilize the country so the central government can ram through draconian controls.
[00:08:01.705 --> 00:08:15.409]  Twitter is clearly being used as an instrument to sow discord worldwide, overthrow some governments, stimulate riots in Western governments as a pretext to crack down on the population.
[00:08:16.229 --> 00:08:28.017]  We here at InfoWars.com support the First Amendment and freedom of speech worldwide 110% and believe in the Bill of Rights and Constitution and that that idea should be spread worldwide.
[00:08:28.237 --> 00:08:31.059]  We call it 1776 Worldwide.
[00:08:31.639 --> 00:08:34.321]  But I am here to tell you on record
[00:08:35.182 --> 00:08:46.589]  That it is not free speech to go onto the internet or any other communication and to say, meet up with me in one hour, we're going to rob the liquor store.
[00:08:46.909 --> 00:08:50.051]  Meet up with me in an hour on this street, let's set fire to people's homes.
[00:08:50.391 --> 00:09:00.317]  That is organized criminal racketeering and the citizens have a right and a duty to meet it with force, even if their globalist social engineering government won't.
[00:09:01.533 --> 00:09:08.378]  We've had our websites and YouTube accounts and other things shut down simply because of our political views.
[00:09:08.819 --> 00:09:15.544]  We've seen the White House demonize the Tea Party and claim that libertarian constitutionalists are violent even when we're not.
[00:09:15.945 --> 00:09:19.647]  We've seen the White House blame the global economic meltdown on the Tea Party.
[00:09:20.068 --> 00:09:29.675]  In the words of Rand Paul, I'm going to raise this later with Max Keiser, that's like blaming firemen when they show up to put out a fire
[00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:31.320]  For the fire.
[00:09:32.541 --> 00:09:41.623]  We're going to go to break and come back with Max Keiser to look at all of this in depth and chart where our political and economic future is going.
[00:09:42.044 --> 00:09:45.145]  Because Max has been right about a lot of what he's discussed.
[00:09:45.485 --> 00:09:46.165]  Please stay with us.
[00:09:49.295 --> 00:09:54.601]  Infowars.com, for 16 years, has led the charge against the technocrats.
[00:09:54.861 --> 00:10:02.830]  We have had unrivaled success in unlocking minds, expanding paradigms, and rallying the people to face the new world order.
[00:10:03.131 --> 00:10:04.212]  No one can deny.
[00:10:04.352 --> 00:10:14.836]  That our media operation is the tip of the spear, and it's because of our success that we have a responsibility to intensify our operations against the globalists 110%.
[00:10:15.036 --> 00:10:19.938]  We're only a month away from launching a weeknight news broadcast.
[00:10:20.118 --> 00:10:22.419]  The social network is nearing completion as well.
[00:10:22.559 --> 00:10:25.200]  The free newsletter is reaching hundreds of thousands.
[00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:29.462]  Please spread the word about InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:10:29.742 --> 00:10:38.832]  Sign up at the top of InfoWars.com for the free InfoWars Insider email with exclusive video and text reports as well as breaking news.
[00:10:39.193 --> 00:10:40.614]  Look in the mirror.
[00:10:40.854 --> 00:10:42.656]  You are the resistance.
[00:10:42.917 --> 00:10:48.523]  It is up to us, the InfoWarriors, to take the initiative and to defeat the globalists.
[00:11:11.664 --> 00:11:15.107]  You're watching an InfoWars.com special report.
[00:11:15.567 --> 00:11:25.154]  The stock market has tanked more than 500 additional points today, a total of 519 on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
[00:11:25.574 --> 00:11:32.299]  On news, the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates at zero or below for the next two years.
[00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:42.075]  There are riots and demonstrations taking place across the world from Israel to England and a massive increase in crime here in the United States.
[00:11:42.676 --> 00:11:51.942]  Joining us to break down exactly what this means and what's coming in the short and long-term future is Max Kaiser of MaxKaiser.com.
[00:11:52.282 --> 00:11:58.246]  He is a former stock trader and of course the inventor of the virtual trading system, the Hollywood Stock Exchange.
[00:11:58.546 --> 00:12:01.588]  And he joins us because he's predicted with great precision
[00:12:02.128 --> 00:12:04.310]  Much of what has now unfolded.
[00:12:04.591 --> 00:12:06.352]  Max Keiser joining us from Paris.
[00:12:06.593 --> 00:12:07.394]  Thanks for being with us.
[00:12:07.994 --> 00:12:08.935]  Sure Alex, anytime.
[00:12:08.955 --> 00:12:09.536]  Great to be here.
[00:12:10.156 --> 00:12:22.990]  Well my friend, break down what we're seeing in the markets right now, what's happening with Bank of America, other bank stocks, and what this signifies to have the Fed announcing that interest rates will be held where they are for the next two years.
[00:12:23.953 --> 00:12:41.060]  Well, you mentioned the Fed talking about keeping interest rates near zero for another two years and talking actually about alternative ways to juice the economy, monetarily speaking, which includes such things as negative interest rates.
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.521]  We can get to in a second.
[00:12:43.396 --> 00:12:52.843]  This whole giving away, monetary easing, typically markets would go up on that news, and as you see, markets are going down on that news.
[00:12:53.243 --> 00:13:09.374]  It's just because after 20 years, 25 years of creating this massive Ponzi scheme of cheap money, and creating a GDP in America that's tied to the banking system, that's tied to cheap money, finally, in the last couple of years, that's no longer working.
[00:13:09.554 --> 00:13:11.876]  So no matter how cheap they make the money,
[00:13:12.455 --> 00:13:17.358]  There's a saturation point a couple of years ago, and it's just falling apart.
[00:13:17.719 --> 00:13:22.102]  So there is no amount of cheap money at this point that will stimulate the economy.
[00:13:22.162 --> 00:13:24.403]  It's like kicking a dead horse, literally.
[00:13:24.443 --> 00:13:37.052]  The economy is dead, the model that has sustained it for 25 years is finished, and all the policymakers are doing is trying to resuscitate the economy using the same tricks they've used for 20 years, and it's not working.
[00:13:37.752 --> 00:13:49.116]  And as a result, you've got this enormous disconnect where the message coming out of the Federal Reserve and from Washington is that we just need more stimulus and everything will be fine around the corner.
[00:13:49.456 --> 00:13:51.457]  And meanwhile, the economy is crashing.
[00:13:51.537 --> 00:13:52.637]  Unemployment is rising.
[00:13:52.757 --> 00:13:54.118]  Social unrest is rising.
[00:13:54.138 --> 00:13:55.618]  You've got riots all over the world.
[00:13:56.038 --> 00:14:00.360]  And they don't seem to make the connection that maybe what they're doing is completely wrong.
[00:14:01.707 --> 00:14:15.224]  Or maybe they have made the connection, and that's why in Europe, the United States, the UK, the social engineers, as soon as they got rid of the Glass-Steagall Act back in the late 1990s, began setting up a very oppressive, authoritarian police state.
[00:14:15.264 --> 00:14:19.849]  In the last decade, they've used the threat of the Manufactured War on Terror
[00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:25.092]  Well, okay, so you can take the point of view that this is a planned, controlled economic demolition.
[00:14:44.910 --> 00:15:03.276]  The result is a return to an economic model that you could call feudalism, really, because all the wealth is concentrated in the upper one-tenth of one percent, and everyone else is essentially an indentured servant, especially if they bring in these negative interest rates, which guarantee being an indentured servant from birth.
[00:15:05.518 --> 00:15:16.908]  It's easy to say that this is the agenda of the banks because it's the easiest way to make money and they've been very successful without anybody stopping them from putting this in place.
[00:15:17.228 --> 00:15:24.595]  Is it going to be successful keeping down the global insurrection against banker occupation as I call it?
[00:15:25.355 --> 00:15:28.618]  I think that this is the war and now it's on.
[00:15:28.638 --> 00:15:31.401]  We've been talking about it coming for a number of years.
[00:15:31.861 --> 00:15:48.011]  And clearly it's here and it's here obviously in North Africa in the Middle East it's in Europe it's in Athens it's in Dublin and now it's in London in a way that has caught everyone off by surprise really because it's spread very very quickly and it's very violent
[00:15:48.531 --> 00:15:52.634]  And it seems completely anarchistic.
[00:15:53.295 --> 00:16:14.490]  And yet, if you look at this at a more of a broader historical and global perspective, you can see that this is part and parcel of this tension that exists between the bankers, who are stealing wealth on a minute-by-minute basis and getting better and better at it, and nobody's stopping them, and the rest of the world population, which is being disenfranchised, bankrupted,
[00:16:15.971 --> 00:16:34.298]  Max, if you had to choose one geographic area in the world where more of the banksters, the oligarchs, the Ponzi scheme operators are based, wouldn't it be the City of London within London?
[00:16:34.519 --> 00:16:42.082]  And after you give us the answer, describe for folks what the City of London within the City is.
[00:16:43.069 --> 00:16:43.830]  Right, absolutely.
[00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:55.581]  The City of London has been the global center for the global hedge fund community because they're very lax in the regulatory environment for banks and hedge funds.
[00:16:56.181 --> 00:16:59.324]  And as a result, they attract the hedge funds.
[00:16:59.344 --> 00:17:02.507]  They also attract many of these oligarchs that are fleeing their countries.
[00:17:02.527 --> 00:17:05.190]  For example, the Icelandic bankers who stole billions.
[00:17:05.615 --> 00:17:10.156]  They took up residency in London and they give them State Harbor.
[00:17:10.677 --> 00:17:22.220]  As a result, in a perverse way, the real estate in London is out of reach for the average person because of the price appreciation due to the inclusion now and the arrival of all these oligarchs from
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:30.483]  Iceland or from Russia, different territories around the world where they have been able to totally co-opt the system, confiscate wealth.
[00:17:30.583 --> 00:17:38.066]  But London is definitely the center of the global arbitrage and the global money laundering business as well.
[00:17:38.687 --> 00:17:44.909]  And as a result, it attracts all sorts of these kleptocrats and oligarchs.
[00:17:45.509 --> 00:17:51.632]  And the city of London, which is their quote unquote Wall Street, it's a principality within London.
[00:17:52.328 --> 00:17:54.729]  And it fits amongst these other territories.
[00:17:54.749 --> 00:17:56.709]  There's a couple of other territories in the world.
[00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:58.890]  I believe Washington, D.C.
[00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:00.750]  is one of them, and so is the Vatican.
[00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:11.413]  These are three centers of... it's its own sovereign, if you will, and they have their own government, and they kind of communicate with each other.
[00:18:11.433 --> 00:18:16.955]  It's part of the ability of the elite to communicate with each other completely outside of any
[00:18:17.555 --> 00:18:17.955]  No, I don't.
[00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:44.573]  Banking facility that's completely outside of the normal channels of the banking system that's completely unregulated.
[00:18:44.593 --> 00:18:47.514]  It's completely non-visible, non-transparent.
[00:18:47.894 --> 00:19:00.938]  And this is where many of the stock deals go down and where a lot of the inside information is capitalized on before becoming public because it's done completely out of view of the public.
[00:19:01.238 --> 00:19:02.799]  And this shadow banking system
[00:19:04.119 --> 00:19:07.040]  ...is tied into the global derivatives business.
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:11.041]  The credit default swaps, for example, that are destroying Greece.
[00:19:11.261 --> 00:19:13.501]  The credit default swaps that destroyed Ireland.
[00:19:13.722 --> 00:19:15.822]  The credit default swaps that are now destroying America.
[00:19:15.842 --> 00:19:32.246]  You know, when the S&P rating agency downgraded the US from AAA to AA+, suddenly there's huge volatility and there's huge trading activity from the vultures who are now swooping in with credit default swaps and effectively attacking America with the financial weapons.
[00:19:32.748 --> 00:19:34.970]  And this is part of the collapse of the U.S.
[00:19:35.611 --> 00:19:39.014]  These guys have no sovereignty of their own.
[00:19:39.254 --> 00:19:48.542]  They're simply marauding rogue financial bankers or financial terrorists and they go wherever they can make the most money in the U.S.
[00:19:52.358 --> 00:20:00.485]  Groups these six big mega banks that are always pushing a global corporate government that we pay our VAT taxes to.
[00:20:01.726 --> 00:20:06.750]  They're not content now to just buy off our politicians in Europe, England, the United States.
[00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:10.373]  Now they want open world government but at the same time
[00:20:11.754 --> 00:20:21.425]  The laws of nature, the laws of history show that they can't really be above the law forever, especially if they totally decimate their host nations.
[00:20:21.465 --> 00:20:25.129]  I mean, even here in the U.S., some municipalities are having to lay off
[00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:34.353]  Sixty, seventy percent of their police, at a certain point, they're destroying any markets for them to even operate in.
[00:20:34.373 --> 00:20:42.876]  I mean, I understand they're a parasitic system feeding on the real market and the real world, but it seems that they think they can just go on forever.
[00:20:42.936 --> 00:20:46.477]  Max, do you believe that they've bitten off more than they can chew?
[00:20:47.588 --> 00:20:51.009]  Well, let's take a look at what's going on in Europe, for example.
[00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:55.511]  A couple of weeks ago, and for the last couple of years, there's been this ongoing crisis in Europe.
[00:20:55.931 --> 00:21:16.020]  Now, what happened last week is that the European Central Bank, principally coming out of Berlin, they're putting together this new European-wide credit facility, a multi-trillion dollar facility, which allows them to repackage all the bad debt in Greece and Ireland, roll it up to this European-wide credit facility, and deal with it over a period of time.
[00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:17.240]  No, we're good to go.
[00:21:32.305 --> 00:21:39.089]  This type of approach to solving the toxic debt problem will be applied and we'll see the emergence of a global central bank.
[00:21:39.709 --> 00:21:45.953]  In Davos last year, it was remarked that they need a $100 trillion credit facility.
[00:21:46.273 --> 00:21:47.133]  Why would they need that?
[00:21:47.193 --> 00:22:00.881]  Because they're going to take all the debts of America and Europe and South America and repackage them in a new global credit facility, probably the new global currency, a variation on the Bancor or the SDR, and repackage and re-securitize, roll that all up,
[00:22:01.261 --> 00:22:10.953]  To the new global banking central bank system, and they'll do this in the name of preserving liquidity and preserving markets and keeping people's purchasing power intact.
[00:22:10.993 --> 00:22:17.121]  But the end result will be all the nations participating will have lost their sovereignty.
[00:22:17.161 --> 00:22:19.263]  They'll be answering to a global institution.
[00:22:20.124 --> 00:22:26.391]  And of course that is not something that people who were born into America sign up for, to lose their sovereignty.
[00:22:26.411 --> 00:22:31.716]  Well that was my next point, is this is a perfect plan for global financial domination.
[00:22:32.537 --> 00:22:34.799]  The countries are signed on to the too big to fail.
[00:22:36.441 --> 00:22:52.719]  And then the nations lose their sovereignty because they've bailed out the banks, but then the megabanks are the bosses over you and order you to cut all of your basic services so that more money can be paid into them when they've created the fraudulent system.
[00:22:52.759 --> 00:22:53.700]  So briefly here,
[00:22:54.662 --> 00:22:56.704]  How do we reverse this?
[00:22:57.445 --> 00:23:07.358]  What are ideas or programs, Max, that you think would be a good way to extricate ourselves out of the finance oligarchs global system?
[00:23:07.818 --> 00:23:09.380]  I mean, one thing would obviously be
[00:23:09.941 --> 00:23:23.888]  To get rid of the Federal Reserve here domestically and in other countries, get rid of the same model and go back to currency being issued as a national credit with the faith of the country behind it, not the Federal Reserve System we got in 1913.
[00:23:25.149 --> 00:23:33.054]  What, raise interest rates right off the 1.5 quadrillion in fiat debt garbage we've been signed on to?
[00:23:33.254 --> 00:23:34.635]  I mean, are those good ideas?
[00:23:35.016 --> 00:23:40.419]  How about we start arresting these banking heads that admittedly sold trillions of dollars of fake instruments?
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:42.761]  I mean, it is truly us or them.
[00:23:43.261 --> 00:23:54.869]  As you said today on the radio, they are imploding our entire world into their own control, and we are going to see more riots looting things that actually just hurt the general public unless we reverse this system.
[00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:58.673]  Well, my favorite idea is to arrest the bankers.
[00:23:59.373 --> 00:24:10.485]  And you have a great example of that with the 1980s with Bill Black, the regulator at the time, who arrested and prosecuted more than a thousand bankers at once as a result of the savings and loan crisis.
[00:24:10.885 --> 00:24:13.688]  Now, everything is in place for a repeat of that event.
[00:24:14.208 --> 00:24:19.212]  And to put these top bankers in jail for committing massive acts of financial fraud.
[00:24:19.513 --> 00:24:21.654]  And I think this would clean up the system.
[00:24:21.734 --> 00:24:29.500]  It would send a message to the public that looting is no longer tolerated and it would be a great step forward.
[00:24:29.581 --> 00:24:31.242]  I mean, that's an obvious step.
[00:24:31.642 --> 00:24:34.065]  Now, why doesn't the Attorney General make that step?
[00:24:34.205 --> 00:24:36.948]  Why doesn't Barack Obama encourage that step?
[00:24:37.448 --> 00:24:39.310]  Because they're totally co-opted by the system.
[00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:47.399]  So the entire institutional approach, whether it's trying to go after them on a legal basis, or try to reinstitute sound money,
[00:24:47.759 --> 00:24:48.360]  Civil disobedience.
[00:25:04.893 --> 00:25:06.294]  Or a violent reaction.
[00:25:06.514 --> 00:25:09.096]  Clearly, you would want a civil disobedience reaction.
[00:25:09.136 --> 00:25:10.137]  That's your first choice.
[00:25:10.697 --> 00:25:15.761]  And if you're trying to attack the banking system and you want to hit it where it hurts, I can think of a few ways.
[00:25:15.821 --> 00:25:21.865]  Number one, there could be a mass participation and a mass default on mortgages.
[00:25:22.225 --> 00:25:25.407]  This would destroy the banks and send a message.
[00:25:25.547 --> 00:25:27.629]  There could be a mass default on credit cards.
[00:25:28.129 --> 00:25:32.630]  There could be in the UK, as we mentioned before, a boycott of the license fee to the BBC.
[00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:38.292]  The BBC has got to be held responsible for not reporting on the crime for the past 10 years.
[00:25:38.552 --> 00:25:40.852]  So those are the types of civil disobedience acts.
[00:25:40.892 --> 00:25:46.254]  Of course, on your show, going back to November of last year, we suggested people buy silver.
[00:25:46.294 --> 00:25:47.134]  It was 26.
[00:25:47.414 --> 00:25:48.534]  It's now over 40.
[00:25:49.154 --> 00:25:50.775]  And, you know, that has the double action
[00:25:51.435 --> 00:25:58.482]  Of preserving your wealth as well as exposing banks on Wall Street to the liabilities of their short sale on silver.
[00:25:58.522 --> 00:26:09.392]  I saw a headline today on Joint Report that talked about the fact that traders who were short gold, they sold short gold, they sold gold that they don't own, they are getting decimated.
[00:26:09.432 --> 00:26:10.413]  They are getting hammered.
[00:26:10.673 --> 00:26:12.155]  They're suffering huge losses.
[00:26:12.495 --> 00:26:16.898]  That has to happen if the system will return to any kind of integrity.
[00:26:17.238 --> 00:26:35.130]  And so it is that fundamental rebellion of people going back to what's valuable, gold, silver, food, land, information, and more and more just simply pulling out of the fiat system that will then expose these financial vampires and will
[00:26:36.411 --> 00:26:39.253]  Show that they've been engaging in naked shorts.
[00:26:39.533 --> 00:26:43.035]  Two final questions for Max Keiser of MaxKeiser.com.
[00:26:43.695 --> 00:26:45.796]  And it's a perfect segue.
[00:26:45.857 --> 00:26:47.017]  I want to talk about gold.
[00:26:47.477 --> 00:26:55.302]  It's now gone up to $1,800 today on the announcement that Western governments are going to accelerate the devaluation of their currencies.
[00:26:55.322 --> 00:26:58.824]  We saw other major commodities go up as well.
[00:26:59.704 --> 00:27:03.987]  JP Morgan two days ago had said they thought $1,800 by the end of the year.
[00:27:04.307 --> 00:27:04.747]  Now they're saying $2,500.
[00:27:06.028 --> 00:27:06.869]  Or higher.
[00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:08.532]  So give us your view on that.
[00:27:08.592 --> 00:27:11.095]  And then let's briefly talk about Bank of America.
[00:27:11.756 --> 00:27:13.498]  Are they the next Lehman Brothers?
[00:27:13.538 --> 00:27:19.386]  Are they the next sacrificial lamb to terrorize the public into more banker bailouts?
[00:27:20.558 --> 00:27:27.220]  Well, as you know, gold and silver, it's a function of the relative price of the US dollar.
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:30.141]  And the dollar is very weak.
[00:27:30.581 --> 00:27:34.182]  It's hitting new lows against Swiss franc and other currencies around the world.
[00:27:34.823 --> 00:27:42.145]  And obviously, if Ben Bernanke is saying that he's going to keep interest rates at 0% for an indefinite period of time,
[00:27:42.765 --> 00:27:45.709]  That means that there's no incentive to buy dollars at all.
[00:27:45.829 --> 00:27:54.601]  And Greenspan, Greenspan, don't forget on Meet the Press Sunday, Meet the Horse, said that, hey, we're not going to default, we're just going to print more money.
[00:27:54.841 --> 00:27:57.745]  That was a hyperinflationary Weimar Republic statement.
[00:27:57.765 --> 00:27:58.266]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:27:58.706 --> 00:27:59.767]  Well, that's exactly right.
[00:28:00.047 --> 00:28:04.850]  And China immediately came out and said, we find your views irresponsible.
[00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:07.211]  And they're our largest creditor in the U.S.
[00:28:07.572 --> 00:28:09.173]  and they've been actively buying gold.
[00:28:09.473 --> 00:28:10.834]  So the dollar and the U.S.
[00:28:10.874 --> 00:28:15.296]  policy really, if you think about it, the only possible way you can grow the U.S.
[00:28:15.336 --> 00:28:15.817]  economy
[00:28:16.657 --> 00:28:31.074]  If you look at the various levers out there, what you could push, what you could pull to try to create some wealth, there's only one viable path and that would be to debase the dollar to try to make exports more viable in the global economy, in particular America's agricultural
[00:28:31.554 --> 00:28:32.014]  Exports.
[00:28:32.134 --> 00:28:35.395]  America still does do a lot of agricultural export.
[00:28:35.435 --> 00:28:40.997]  If they can crash the dollar, they will get more agriculture exported out of the U.S.
[00:28:41.017 --> 00:28:50.200]  But it'll take years to get an industrial base back, even if our currency was comparable to the Chinese currency or something like the peso.
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:51.941]  I mean, this is asinine.
[00:28:52.523 --> 00:28:59.968]  Well, as I've said on your show before, I've made the prediction that before long, the biggest industry in America will be cotton picking.
[00:29:01.369 --> 00:29:07.312]  And everyone should familiarize themselves with some of those old spirituals like jump down, pick a bale of cotton.
[00:29:08.733 --> 00:29:10.734]  Now, moving on to Bank of America.
[00:29:11.495 --> 00:29:20.200]  Bank of America, of course, bought into a couple of the failed lending institutions during the last crisis.
[00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:28.785]  And as a result, they absorbed billions, hundreds of billions of bad debts and trillions in derivatives.
[00:29:29.405 --> 00:29:31.026]  And because there hasn't been any growth,
[00:29:31.727 --> 00:29:33.608]  In the two or three years, predictably.
[00:29:34.148 --> 00:29:40.932]  There hasn't been any ability to write any of that stuff off or pay any of it down, so now Bank of America is going to go down.
[00:29:41.232 --> 00:29:52.978]  And this is a huge bank, and it would send shockwaves through the global economy once again, set off another banking crisis, set off another bailout scenario, and further debase the dollar.
[00:29:53.278 --> 00:29:55.719]  But Bank of America looks like it's getting close.
[00:29:55.779 --> 00:29:58.100]  And Citigroup also looks problematic.
[00:29:58.440 --> 00:29:59.201]  Their balance sheets
[00:29:59.981 --> 00:30:00.562]  Yeah, of course.
[00:30:21.892 --> 00:30:23.513]  Yeah, it has to be.
[00:30:23.533 --> 00:30:25.313]  No one's going to escape it.
[00:30:26.154 --> 00:30:37.678]  And on the other end of this, there's going to be the bankers are going to try to flee to territories more like Prince from that group of
[00:30:39.118 --> 00:30:43.801]  Yeah, he's over there in the Middle East now, UAE, without any extradition agreement.
[00:30:43.821 --> 00:30:47.322]  So you see more bankers going to UAE and other territories.
[00:30:47.342 --> 00:30:48.203]  Halliburton moved there.
[00:30:48.243 --> 00:30:51.264]  So literally, we do see them running off with the loot.
[00:30:51.564 --> 00:30:57.087]  And in a way, that's even more dangerous to see the elites running, you know, the Bushes buying all this land in Paraguay.
[00:30:57.367 --> 00:31:00.729]  That's even creepier to think that they know they've committed so many crimes.
[00:31:01.229 --> 00:31:06.872]  That they're just fleeing, leaving us with the aftermath of what they've done.
[00:31:06.892 --> 00:31:21.618]  But I think at the end of the day, that's why it's good news that you're there, I'm here, so many other great people, Ron Paul, are out there talking about the real issues, so that hopefully we can pick up the pieces when all this is over and move in the right direction.
[00:31:21.678 --> 00:31:27.821]  Perhaps the globalists will miscalculate, but I think right now it's so important that we all get the word out and expose this.
[00:31:28.241 --> 00:31:30.362]  Max Keiser, final quick comment from you.
[00:31:31.062 --> 00:31:34.264]  Where do you see gold this time next year?
[00:31:34.284 --> 00:31:39.406]  I mean, I know we're talking about $2,500 by the end of the year, and now that looks believable for a lot of folks.
[00:31:39.446 --> 00:31:46.469]  We've passed all these psychological milestones, $1,800 now today, but where do you see us in August of next year?
[00:31:48.393 --> 00:31:56.665]  Well, I'm just banking on continuation of the next 10 years, what we've seen in the previous 10 years.
[00:31:56.905 --> 00:32:02.332]  And that's 22-23% annualized compounded rates of return for gold and silver.
[00:32:02.813 --> 00:32:03.955]  And that's all you need to know.
[00:32:04.595 --> 00:32:09.879]  As far as any interim moves up or down, don't look at that at all.
[00:32:09.999 --> 00:32:12.521]  A very interesting study came out just a few days ago.
[00:32:12.861 --> 00:32:27.072]  They said people who held their goal and did not try to time it on the tops and bottoms did substantially, 100% better than people who, according to basic timing models, tried to get in and out of their goal and timing these swings.
[00:32:27.352 --> 00:32:31.115]  Those people actually are doing bad compared to people who just hold it,
[00:32:31.895 --> 00:32:33.796]  You know, and let it ride.
[00:32:33.897 --> 00:32:34.297]  Absolutely.
[00:32:34.317 --> 00:32:35.718]  I mean, look at an 11-year graph.
[00:32:36.418 --> 00:32:39.160]  Gold's below 311 years ago, silver $5.
[00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:40.141]  Silver's above $40.
[00:32:41.382 --> 00:32:42.122]  Gold is at $1,800.
[00:32:42.383 --> 00:32:45.925]  You don't have to be a rocket scientist to understand what's happening there.
[00:32:46.245 --> 00:32:48.407]  Max Keiser, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:32:48.887 --> 00:32:49.287]  Anytime.
[00:32:49.307 --> 00:32:49.768]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:32:50.450 --> 00:33:02.043]  All right, there's Max Keiser, another one of the extremely informative guests that we interview each and every day live on the radio, and now on these InfoWars special reports, and starting, of course, September 1st.
[00:33:02.623 --> 00:33:06.467]  Just in a few weeks, we start the weekly 30-minute news transmission.
[00:33:07.248 --> 00:33:08.269]  Every night at 7 p.m.
[00:33:08.289 --> 00:33:10.190]  Central at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:33:10.570 --> 00:33:25.420]  Now for a closer look inside the now entering the fifth day of riots in the UK and fires and looting all over what is known as England inside the UK is Paul Joseph Watson of PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:27.822]  We're going to go to a short break and come right back to him.
[00:33:28.802 --> 00:33:30.223]  It is a big idea.
[00:33:30.243 --> 00:33:32.345]  A new world order.
[00:33:36.727 --> 00:33:41.371]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:33:42.953 --> 00:33:45.775]  It's known as the Builderberg Group.
[00:33:45.815 --> 00:33:48.037]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:33:50.239 --> 00:33:52.742]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:33:53.582 --> 00:34:01.069]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:34:07.745 --> 00:34:12.806]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:34:14.606 --> 00:34:18.187]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:34:19.347 --> 00:34:22.368]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:34:22.488 --> 00:34:27.769]  Only an educated and informed public can stop them in their tracks.
[00:34:29.029 --> 00:34:32.190]  For the first time, all the pieces have been put together.
[00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:35.991]  The dots have been connected, and the picture is crystal clear.
[00:34:37.242 --> 00:34:40.643]  Earth's ruling elite believe they have discovered the fountain of youth.
[00:34:41.563 --> 00:34:45.764]  But before they can attain it, 80% of us must die.
[00:34:45.784 --> 00:34:53.286]  A psychopathic technocracy is establishing world government so there can be no escape from their plan.
[00:34:58.789 --> 00:35:01.010]  The New World Order is the Old World Order.
[00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:03.351]  I mean, it's just the names have changed, the appearances have changed.
[00:35:04.031 --> 00:35:05.152]  Most people have no idea.
[00:35:05.172 --> 00:35:05.952]  They're not after money.
[00:35:05.972 --> 00:35:07.092]  They have all the money they need.
[00:35:07.312 --> 00:35:08.093]  They're after power.
[00:35:09.013 --> 00:35:09.974]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[00:35:11.214 --> 00:35:14.055]  I was pulled off a plane in Munich.
[00:35:14.095 --> 00:35:15.276]  They interrogated me for four hours.
[00:35:15.356 --> 00:35:16.356]  Some shots were fired.
[00:35:16.376 --> 00:35:17.657]  I need you to move off the province.
[00:35:18.737 --> 00:35:22.339]  Their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:35:27.205 --> 00:35:27.586]  Endgame.
[00:35:27.967 --> 00:35:29.709]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:31.252]  You have been warned.
[00:35:56.018 --> 00:36:00.260]  Thank you for joining us for this InfoWars.com special report.
[00:36:00.781 --> 00:36:07.304]  Paul Watson is a long-time reporter for InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com in the UK.
[00:36:07.625 --> 00:36:18.311]  We're now entering the fifth days of some of the worst rioting ever to hit the United Kingdom, and Paul has discovered some very important information.
[00:36:18.811 --> 00:36:24.174]  Days ago, we received reports from journalists on the ground that police were ordered to stand down.
[00:36:24.794 --> 00:36:38.600]  As of today, they have admitted that indeed they were ordered to stand down, and there are other reports that men posing as journalists were basically offering money to youth if they too would engage in rioting.
[00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:48.465]  The question is, why has a green light been given at this time for this type of activity attacking family-owned shops, burning down businesses, and even homes?
[00:36:48.765 --> 00:36:51.486]  Paul Watson from Prison Planet, what's the latest?
[00:36:53.237 --> 00:36:54.478]  Well that's correct Alex.
[00:36:54.538 --> 00:37:07.769]  Yesterday we reported that, quote, the lacklustre police response with numerous reports from the public that police stood back and allowed looters to pillage both large department stores and private small businesses for hours on end.
[00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:27.235]  And today that's being confirmed because sources from within Scotland Yard have confirmed to both the Daily Mail and the Times of London that police were ordered to quote stand and observe on those first few nights of rioting as the looters, the rioters set fire to
[00:37:27.935 --> 00:37:32.957]  Buildings, both homes and small businesses, they were ordered to stand back and let it happen.
[00:37:33.357 --> 00:37:39.919]  And of course, we said that this was going to be the case all along because it's routine, standard operating procedure.
[00:37:40.299 --> 00:37:49.502]  The authorities allow the chaos to spiral, to build, and it causes, it provokes the general public, specifically the middle class.
[00:37:50.242 --> 00:37:59.908]  To demand the police state measures which the government is all too keen to later give them and that's exactly what's going to happen tomorrow with Parliament being recalled.
[00:37:59.928 --> 00:38:09.154]  They're going to have a debate and they're going to set the stage for a law which is going to basically criminalise public gatherings without government permission.
[00:38:09.735 --> 00:38:19.301]  So that's the upshot of it and so to claim that this is some kind of organic political revolution against bankers is fundamentally naive.
[00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:32.535]  Um, it's a mistake to embrace what are essentially a group of drunk, mindless teenagers and pretend that they're on some kind of frontline war against the establishment, because they're not.
[00:38:33.315 --> 00:38:37.857]  Um, you know, not every flash mob is a revolution, and to pretend that it is...
[00:38:39.095 --> 00:38:40.737]  It's, again, completely naive.
[00:38:40.777 --> 00:38:41.857]  It's wishful thinking.
[00:38:41.937 --> 00:38:43.338]  Well, you know why that's being done.
[00:38:43.999 --> 00:38:55.848]  They're blurring the lines so that now when anybody does have a political flash mob, or when anybody does actually go after real targets, like the banksters, then it can be demonized.
[00:38:55.888 --> 00:38:57.349]  We've seen cases here in the U.S.
[00:38:57.369 --> 00:39:02.953]  where they send the army in plain clothes to spy on, in the Fed, peaceful demonstrations.
[00:39:03.954 --> 00:39:04.394]  And so,
[00:39:05.715 --> 00:39:17.245]  The UK government, as you know Paul, four years ago came out and said, as austerity measures come in, there is going to be intensified social resistance, so we've got to put a police state in place.
[00:39:17.805 --> 00:39:29.115]  And so now, ahead of that, they're just allowing the hooligans, who are just your regular sports fans, who riot after a soccer game, or riot after games in Brazil, basketball games in Los Angeles,
[00:39:30.316 --> 00:39:31.737]  Soccer games in South Africa.
[00:39:32.057 --> 00:39:42.346]  It's the same types all over the world, mainly the welfare class, that go out and do this as a sport and as a way to steal some loot and some goodies.
[00:39:42.646 --> 00:39:52.153]  And so now their activities, targeting mom-and-pop shops and homes, is being transposed over legitimate political debate and discussion.
[00:39:52.534 --> 00:39:57.698]  And the fact that they've waited four days to finally get the Parliament back and do this is incredibly frightening.
[00:39:59.175 --> 00:40:07.299]  Well yeah, and that's why it's completely stupid to embrace them, because then that's what we're going to be labelled with, is the supporters of these mobs.
[00:40:07.339 --> 00:40:08.880]  I mean, just look what they're attacking.
[00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:14.682]  They're not laying siege to the Houses of Parliament, they're laying siege to JD Sports.
[00:40:14.763 --> 00:40:20.325]  They're attacking family-owned local businesses that have survived two world wars and raising them to the ground.
[00:40:20.625 --> 00:40:23.687]  They're attacking charity shops, cat rescue centres,
[00:40:24.167 --> 00:40:26.229]  Hospitals that care for sick babies.
[00:40:26.730 --> 00:40:31.955]  And now they're killing people by running them down in their cars in Birmingham, just 20 minutes from where I live.
[00:40:32.556 --> 00:40:36.159]  You have the video of this young Malaysian kid lying on the street bleeding.
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:41.725]  The rioters pretend to help him up, then threaten to stab him and steal his stuff.
[00:40:41.985 --> 00:40:44.788]  How on earth is that protesting against bankers?
[00:40:45.309 --> 00:40:47.211]  I mean, these are just opportunist thugs.
[00:40:47.771 --> 00:40:50.172]  And so I'm sorry, but that doesn't represent me.
[00:40:50.472 --> 00:41:04.258]  I don't think it represents our movement, and I think it's foolish to try and embrace it and say that it does, because later down the line we will be discredited and blamed for all this chaos, just like the Tea Party's being blamed for the financial collapse.
[00:41:04.278 --> 00:41:05.359]  They're going to pin it on us.
[00:41:05.499 --> 00:41:11.902]  Oh yeah, I wonder if the Tea Party's causing what's happening in Israel with the protest, or the protest ongoing in Egypt.
[00:41:13.573 --> 00:41:14.433]  Rand Paul put it well.
[00:41:14.453 --> 00:41:20.516]  It's like the fire department shows up to put out your burning house, and you blame them for starting the fire.
[00:41:21.717 --> 00:41:31.961]  There is such a pent-up anger, though, at the corrupt system that people are hoping that this is the revolution that people are looking for.
[00:41:32.522 --> 00:41:34.422]  Now, Paul, there's another big issue here.
[00:41:34.462 --> 00:41:39.665]  You notice these riots are going on, and these racial robberies and things are going on in Chicago.
[00:41:40.325 --> 00:41:43.128]  In New York, in the other few U.S.
[00:41:43.168 --> 00:41:45.870]  cities where they have a total gun ban for citizens.
[00:41:46.530 --> 00:41:59.802]  That's where the welfare type people go, they congregate, the opportunistic criminals congregate because they know they're going to be protected and they're going to be feeding on unarmed citizenry.
[00:42:00.422 --> 00:42:03.823]  Look at England, where you've had people who've been robbed three times in a row in their own home.
[00:42:04.203 --> 00:42:05.383]  They get an illegal gun.
[00:42:05.763 --> 00:42:07.044]  They shoot one of the intruders.
[00:42:07.464 --> 00:42:08.944]  They get the book thrown at them.
[00:42:09.324 --> 00:42:13.865]  I've seen cases in England, people pushing someone down a flight of stairs that's robbing them.
[00:42:14.265 --> 00:42:15.646]  They get the book thrown at them.
[00:42:16.026 --> 00:42:23.748]  So there's a real desire by the social engineers in England to leave the general law-abiding public servile and dependent on the state.
[00:42:24.557 --> 00:42:30.443]  So the state can prey on the public and then also menace them with the zombie welfare hordes.
[00:42:30.723 --> 00:42:32.245]  Do you concur with that analysis?
[00:42:33.786 --> 00:42:34.407]  Yes, I do.
[00:42:34.627 --> 00:42:42.354]  And for people to say that because we don't embrace these looting hooligans means that we somehow support the system is asinine.
[00:42:42.595 --> 00:42:46.278]  I mean, try and hold more than one concept in your head at the same time.
[00:42:46.338 --> 00:42:48.640]  I know it's difficult for some people, but try and do it.
[00:42:49.301 --> 00:42:55.205]  This is not something in Britain that started as a result of the financial collapse three years ago.
[00:42:55.245 --> 00:42:58.948]  I mean, this is an element of British society that stretches back decades.
[00:42:59.268 --> 00:43:09.636]  We've always had this intimidating underclass, and it's always been used by the establishment as a tool against general society, the middle class, law-abiding people.
[00:43:10.436 --> 00:43:10.756]  I don't know.
[00:43:28.976 --> 00:43:34.159]  You know, my first property that I bought was across the road from a crack house in the poorest part of town.
[00:43:34.539 --> 00:43:37.620]  And this is what these mobs, these yobs, like to do.
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:41.422]  It's fun for them to go and burn things and steal things.
[00:43:41.862 --> 00:43:51.927]  It's, as one person in the Guardian today described it, and he was actually involved in the riots in Liverpool back in the 80s, he said it's basically like Nintendo Wii come to life.
[00:43:52.007 --> 00:43:52.968]  It's just fun for them.
[00:43:53.348 --> 00:43:54.369]  They have no idea.
[00:43:54.629 --> 00:43:57.752]  They have no concept of some kind of backlash against the bankers.
[00:43:57.792 --> 00:44:02.917]  It's fun to light somebody's house on fire and have a woman jump to firefighters and then attack the firefighters.
[00:44:03.377 --> 00:44:04.798]  And again, it's a complex issue.
[00:44:04.858 --> 00:44:12.766]  We know the government let this happen so they could then have shoot-to-kill orders for peaceful protesters because they know the resistance to them is mounting.
[00:44:13.266 --> 00:44:16.169]  This is more than, you know, one little thought in our head.
[00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:18.612]  This is three-dimensional, four-dimensional thought.
[00:44:18.933 --> 00:44:25.961]  We understand that when Parliament members start calling for shooting arsonists, that it's going to be used against the general public.
[00:44:26.221 --> 00:44:26.982]  But I'm sorry.
[00:44:27.422 --> 00:44:30.986]  You come to my house and try to set a fire, that's attempted murder.
[00:44:31.087 --> 00:44:31.968]  I'm going to kill you.
[00:44:32.468 --> 00:44:33.609]  I couldn't imagine
[00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:40.033]  Living in England, where people that are out defending their homes are being demonized right now.
[00:44:40.093 --> 00:44:54.222]  That's the one thing that the street thugs can't deal with, and that the nanny nanny state can't deal with, is neighborhoods banding together, the baseball bats all selling out there in England, and people fighting back.
[00:44:54.282 --> 00:45:02.286]  And it's not even the police now that have been fighting back these crowds of miscreants, some of them as young as nine years old, robbing liquor stores.
[00:45:04.235 --> 00:45:10.779]  It's the fact that the people are now standing up that is backing them off in some areas, and so that is certainly good news.
[00:45:11.019 --> 00:45:14.681]  And they're being demonized as some type of right-wing gang.
[00:45:15.082 --> 00:45:25.488]  When anybody's basic instinct is, when you've got roving bands of people, like something out of Road Warrior that we've been warning people about, you've got to stand up to them and nip it in the bud.
[00:45:25.828 --> 00:45:28.470]  And that should have been on day one by the police.
[00:45:28.870 --> 00:45:31.292]  Now, if folks were protesting the government,
[00:45:31.912 --> 00:45:40.018]  And the police attacked a peaceful crowd like Tiananmen Square and then people took over the Parliament and people took over 10 Downing Street and stormed the palaces.
[00:45:40.598 --> 00:45:42.940]  I would say that's a legitimate rebellion.
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:50.125]  But pulling people out of cars and beating people to death and running over people is not that.
[00:45:50.465 --> 00:45:54.888]  And Paul, I hope that you can sit there and defend your country from these people.
[00:45:54.928 --> 00:45:55.789]  Any closing comments?
[00:45:57.011 --> 00:46:02.237]  Yeah, just to say that the people now out defending their property are not just white right-wingers.
[00:46:02.257 --> 00:46:07.003]  You've got Sikhs, you've got Muslims, you've got all kinds of races out there defending their property.
[00:46:07.043 --> 00:46:14.331]  And now the latest reports are that the police are actually moving these people away from the areas where the riots are expected to happen.
[00:46:15.091 --> 00:46:24.878]  I was about to say, they're telling Sikhs who are standing out front of their churches, their temples that are full of valuables, that you're not going to defend it.
[00:46:25.038 --> 00:46:30.802]  By the way, you shouldn't have a sword, because these guys have ceremonial swords, they're standing out front, a normal action of a man.
[00:46:31.822 --> 00:46:35.365]  I believe the three people that got run over by the car defending their property were Muslims.
[00:46:35.825 --> 00:47:01.262]  So I want to point out here, it's so much fun to demonize Muslims all day, but it's Sikhs, it's Muslims, it's right-wing pro-Englanders that are defending law and order, while it's the liberal, trendy, welfare, whites, blacks, Asians, you name it, running around doing this, and it's disgusting, Paul, to see it confirmed that the government is trying to stop the citizens from defending themselves.
[00:47:01.522 --> 00:47:05.365]  If that isn't evidence of how lawless and criminal your government is, I don't know what is.
[00:47:07.006 --> 00:47:11.088]  Exactly, and just don't confuse a flash mob with a revolution.
[00:47:11.348 --> 00:47:14.470]  Not every flash mob is a revolution.
[00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:19.052]  I mean, you had in the communist revolution, the mob was controlled from above.
[00:47:19.112 --> 00:47:20.493]  It fed on the middle class.
[00:47:20.553 --> 00:47:23.254]  It looted people with small amounts of wealth.
[00:47:23.594 --> 00:47:25.355]  Not every revolution is positive.
[00:47:25.615 --> 00:47:27.296]  That's what the NKVD did.
[00:47:27.596 --> 00:47:37.483]  They would send out, Stalin took people out of the prisons and sent them to Ukraine and other places to thuggishly do this and that's what the founders talked about, a republic.
[00:47:38.365 --> 00:47:48.511]  Where no minority can be targeted, where everyone has rights, that the mob cannot vote away, or 51% will vote to enslave the other 49.
[00:47:49.051 --> 00:48:00.038]  And that's why the social engineers, the offshore banks, are always pushing democracy, because they can dumb down the population and use these hordes of dependent people to absolutely rob and destroy us.
[00:48:00.058 --> 00:48:01.579]  That's why I'm so against the illegal aliens.
[00:48:02.119 --> 00:48:21.949]  Because no matter where they come from, they get a liberal handout once they get here, they get indoctrinated, and they get turned against the Second Amendment and private property, and pretty soon the illegals that are now becoming the majority of America are going to vote to take the guns, the property, everything, and the bankers will sit offshore laughing at this.
[00:48:22.029 --> 00:48:25.110]  Paul, looking in England, you're ten years ahead of the United States.
[00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:26.611]  Any final comments?
[00:48:28.052 --> 00:48:37.820]  Yeah, we've just got to be wary of the fact that these groups of disaffected youths are going to be used as a weapon to petrify the middle class into demanding the police state that is laid to use them.
[00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:45.646]  So try and look at it from a more sophisticated approach than saying, oh, if you don't support the rioters, then you support the establishment.
[00:48:45.886 --> 00:48:48.208]  You've got to be a little bit more sophisticated than that.
[00:48:48.268 --> 00:48:58.275]  No, the establishment is supporting the rioters by protecting them and giving them their liberation theology and leaving them alone and telling the vigilantes they don't have a right to defend themselves.
[00:48:59.076 --> 00:49:03.959]  And telling the police to stand down, which is now being revealed that that's what happened in the first three days.
[00:49:04.019 --> 00:49:11.685]  So we'll wait and see what Parliament says tomorrow, and undoubtedly it's going to be the start of a more draconian crackdown in Great Britain.
[00:49:12.569 --> 00:49:18.814]  Absolutely, and we'll watch it all with you and your brother there in England, Steve Watson, in London itself.
[00:49:19.254 --> 00:49:23.918]  And we also have other reporters that have been popping in who have witnessed racial attacks, you name it.
[00:49:24.238 --> 00:49:35.527]  This is really bringing out the ugliest side of so many people, but also the best side of many others, like the Sikhs, the Muslims, and the quote, England first, evil right-wingers that are being demonized.
[00:49:36.228 --> 00:49:38.530]  Paul Watson, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:39.751]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:49:41.243 --> 00:49:44.906]  My friends, we'll be covering this all live tomorrow on the radio, 11 a.m.
[00:49:44.966 --> 00:49:45.326]  Central.
[00:49:45.346 --> 00:49:59.296]  If you don't have XM, or if you're not listening on a local AM or FM station, you can always listen to the free audio streams at InfoWars.com, or you can get the free iPhone app to listen on your iPhone or Droid where and when you want.
[00:49:59.776 --> 00:50:03.579]  Again, thank you so much for tuning into this special transmission.
[00:50:03.599 --> 00:50:07.722]  I want to thank PrisonPlanet.tv members for their support to make this possible.
[00:50:08.183 --> 00:50:17.270]  And don't forget we have the new nightly television show that will be condensed and focused and hard-hitting starting September 1st here at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:50:18.971 --> 00:50:25.613]  Well that's it for this InfoWars special report with Max Keiser and of course Paul Watson and yours truly Alex Jones.
[00:50:25.913 --> 00:50:31.255]  I want to say also in closing, fabulous job to our dedicated InfoWars crew.
[00:50:31.595 --> 00:50:33.756]  We'll see you back tomorrow live on the radio.
