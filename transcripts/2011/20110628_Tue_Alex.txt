[00:00:04.871 --> 00:00:05.511]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.171 --> 00:00:07.212]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.952 --> 00:00:09.073]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.713 --> 00:00:10.513]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.293 --> 00:00:12.274]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.834 --> 00:00:16.416]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.016 --> 00:00:21.137]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:39.917]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here live with a bit of a hoarse voice from screaming at the corrupt House and Senate members in the Texas Legislature yesterday without the aid of a bullhorn inside of the Capitol.
[00:00:39.937 --> 00:00:51.124]  We also pulled a nice stunt where we got the Patriots into the gallery and then as they came out one by one I could scream full bore over the open door.
[00:00:52.106 --> 00:00:54.969]  And audibly let them know that we were aware of their treason.
[00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:56.330]  It was extremely effective.
[00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.492]  Just happened to spontaneously think of the idea.
[00:00:59.512 --> 00:01:02.595]  Shot a lot of great footage inside.
[00:01:02.615 --> 00:01:06.518]  We have some terrible news, obviously, on two different fronts.
[00:01:06.718 --> 00:01:13.544]  Dealing with the fight against the Tenth Amendment annihilating goon forces of the TSA.
[00:01:14.905 --> 00:01:43.395]  And a chronicle of the treacherous activity here in the great state of Texas that has turned the House bill into a toothless creature and the Senate bill into actual pro-New World Order law, precedent-setting law that any citizen can be detained without even reasonable
[00:01:44.395 --> 00:01:44.995]  Suspicion.
[00:01:45.836 --> 00:01:53.640]  Because it redefines reasonable suspicion to not that you pull somebody over for a broken taillight and somebody's beating on the back of the truck saying, help me.
[00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:55.962]  That's reasonable suspicion.
[00:01:56.042 --> 00:01:59.104]  Or you see a heroin injector laying in the front seat of the car.
[00:02:00.345 --> 00:02:02.307]  That's a reasonable suspicion.
[00:02:02.327 --> 00:02:02.367]  No.
[00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:17.783]  Now, just that anytime, anywhere, you can be in mass, put on a Terry stop or custodial arrest, and that the proctology exams should then commence.
[00:02:19.022 --> 00:02:21.263]  And so that is basically what they've done.
[00:02:21.303 --> 00:02:24.565]  I stayed up here late last night going over the House bill.
[00:02:25.466 --> 00:02:28.327]  I was unaware the Senate, after we left, had passed a Senate bill.
[00:02:28.727 --> 00:02:30.749]  Then I read that this morning, scanned over it.
[00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:39.834]  And we're going to be breaking down for you exactly what's going on coming up at the bottom of this hour.
[00:02:41.254 --> 00:02:41.475]  But
[00:02:43.314 --> 00:02:45.596]  I tend to gain my voice back.
[00:02:45.616 --> 00:02:49.278]  It's strange once it's gotten hoarse after I've been talking a while.
[00:02:49.338 --> 00:02:50.259]  It's the opposite.
[00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:51.980]  At least that's how my larynx works.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.984]  So I'm warming up right now and should be able to really properly be...
[00:03:01.425 --> 00:03:03.807]  Well, it's like a race car engine or any engine.
[00:03:05.128 --> 00:03:06.229]  I'm idling right now.
[00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:07.670]  It's warming up.
[00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.992]  My synapses are beginning to accelerate.
[00:03:11.052 --> 00:03:11.833]  They're firing.
[00:03:12.593 --> 00:03:19.638]  And so I'm going to get into that whole area once I've gotten to some of the other news at the bottom of the hour.
[00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:24.342]  We have Colonel Craig Roberts on, who doesn't do radio interviews anymore.
[00:03:25.837 --> 00:03:28.861]  And I had to twist his arm last week to come on today.
[00:03:28.921 --> 00:03:29.602]  He's a great guy.
[00:03:29.622 --> 00:03:30.784]  He'll be joining us coming up.
[00:03:30.844 --> 00:03:31.745]  He's a listener of the show.
[00:03:31.785 --> 00:03:33.968]  He just doesn't go on talk radio anymore.
[00:03:34.588 --> 00:03:37.212]  Semi-retired, busy taking care of family and people.
[00:03:38.393 --> 00:03:40.376]  He's also a cancer survivor in his own right.
[00:03:42.205 --> 00:03:44.927]  Highly decorated Marine in Vietnam.
[00:03:45.508 --> 00:03:45.948]  Sniper.
[00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:50.692]  Wrote the best-selling sniper book, One Shot One Kill, New York Times bestseller.
[00:03:50.712 --> 00:03:51.712]  Wrote a bunch of bestsellers.
[00:03:52.613 --> 00:04:00.659]  At the same time while he was doing that, he was a SWAT team commander in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and the lead helicopter pilot for the police helicopter as well.
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.842]  Survived an amazing helicopter crash one time when the helicopter failed.
[00:04:05.402 --> 00:04:06.363]  Didn't tell you that story.
[00:04:06.983 --> 00:04:22.112]  And he also investigated Oklahoma City and found out that, well, Billy Clinton, or William Jefferson Clinton, and his deputy attorney general and others at the time were pulling the strings on that event.
[00:04:23.132 --> 00:04:32.938]  So, and then on the subsequent cover-up, and then a lot of folks had to die, of course, in Oklahoma, including Cop of the Year in Oklahoma City, Terrence Yakey, when he wouldn't shut up.
[00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:35.680]  He even called his wife and said they were after him.
[00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:42.344]  He thought that they poisoned him, and he had to get to his locker and get the information out before he died.
[00:04:42.364 --> 00:04:46.627]  And, of course, he called his partner and said, the FBI is behind me.
[00:04:46.647 --> 00:04:49.569]  And, well, they pulled him over on that road and tortured him to death.
[00:04:50.814 --> 00:04:56.057]  But we're going to be talking to him, Ron Paul today, Webster Tarpley from Tripoli.
[00:04:56.417 --> 00:04:57.698]  But the big news is coming up.
[00:04:57.718 --> 00:04:58.158]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.561 --> 00:05:10.066]  The folks at eFoodsDirect have saved you from the huge price increases on food by buying raw materials ahead and packing your supplies themselves.
[00:05:10.566 --> 00:05:14.648]  They haven't increased their prices on great long-term food reserves since last year.
[00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:20.192]  With the rising cost of raw materials and gas prices, they can't hold off any longer.
[00:05:20.872 --> 00:05:28.861]  As of July 1st, Ifu's Direct is forced to increase their prices so they can still ship you the best storable food on the planet.
[00:05:29.201 --> 00:05:34.647]  Until the end of June, you can lock in the cost of your food at last year's prices by calling 800-409-5633.
[00:05:38.371 --> 00:05:44.778]  Your time is running out to build your supply with the best food on the planet at last year's prices with eFoods Direct.
[00:05:45.058 --> 00:05:45.498]  Call 800-409-5633.

[00:06:01.277 --> 00:06:02.778]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:06:02.998 --> 00:06:08.021]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:06:08.301 --> 00:06:09.662]  Saving means to make money.
[00:06:09.822 --> 00:06:18.607]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:06:19.347 --> 00:06:26.454]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:06:26.894 --> 00:06:34.501]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:06:34.902 --> 00:06:39.826]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[00:06:40.126 --> 00:06:42.288]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:06:45.051 --> 00:06:47.975]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.

[00:07:00.745 --> 00:07:15.215]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:07:16.215 --> 00:07:19.898]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:20.905 --> 00:07:32.898]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:07:33.659 --> 00:07:40.946]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:07:41.607 --> 00:07:51.212]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:07:51.993 --> 00:07:55.255]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:07:55.915 --> 00:07:59.117]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:08:00.578 --> 00:08:05.240]  This Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:07.842]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:17.902 --> 00:08:23.125]  It is Tuesday, the 28th day of June 2011.
[00:08:23.945 --> 00:08:25.586]  I am Alex Jones, your host.
[00:08:25.926 --> 00:08:27.447]  I'm not a conservative.
[00:08:27.467 --> 00:08:28.448]  I'm not a liberal.
[00:08:30.336 --> 00:08:32.117]  You can't even really call me a libertarian.
[00:08:32.337 --> 00:08:33.678]  I'm a constitutionalist.
[00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:34.759]  I'm a freedom lover.
[00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:36.240]  I believe in right and wrong.
[00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:44.486]  I don't look at subjects and say, well, I'm a Democrat, so I'm going to support whatever they're doing, or I'm a Republican, I'm going to support whatever they're doing.
[00:08:44.506 --> 00:08:46.288]  I'm going to buy into whatever lies they're pushing.
[00:08:47.168 --> 00:08:49.970]  I am a realist who wants to study reality.
[00:08:50.851 --> 00:08:55.214]  And study the human species, and our history, our present, and our future destiny.
[00:08:55.795 --> 00:08:57.876]  And I'm attempting to make the world a better place.
[00:08:58.477 --> 00:09:04.981]  And no matter how damaging to myself it is, and to my name, I will say what I believe the truth is.
[00:09:05.382 --> 00:09:05.862]  Period.
[00:09:07.163 --> 00:09:16.250]  And it is an empowering thing in life to, over the years, train myself to not care what people think about me.
[00:09:17.003 --> 00:09:25.749]  And in that, I believe, is the essence of true freedom, the essence of art, the essence of discovering more and more of what real reality is.
[00:09:25.849 --> 00:09:26.970]  Life is an adventure.
[00:09:27.571 --> 00:09:28.451]  It is a quest.
[00:09:28.972 --> 00:09:30.953]  Every minute of it is magical.
[00:09:32.214 --> 00:09:44.583]  And in understanding that, you can also open up wider horizons and not let the Madison Avenue spin doctors make you feel inadequate so they can sell you their modern, culture-killing, New World Order system of death.
[00:09:45.704 --> 00:09:45.864]  Now,
[00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:54.443]  I say this now pretty much at the beginning of every broadcast because it's true.
[00:09:56.205 --> 00:10:06.872]  The amount of insane, crazy, out-in-the-open tyranny and world government open announcements and bizarre globalist activity fulfilling everything they promised that they would do
[00:10:08.696 --> 00:10:10.257]  is reaching a crescendo.
[00:10:10.817 --> 00:10:24.301]  But every time I think we're reaching a crescendo, a week later it makes the last finale look like a black cat firecracker compared to a howitzer shell going off above your head.
[00:10:25.441 --> 00:10:26.841]  It's all getting wilder.
[00:10:26.941 --> 00:10:28.222]  The world is speeding up.
[00:10:28.382 --> 00:10:29.362]  Life is speeding up.
[00:10:30.042 --> 00:10:31.943]  We are headed towards the singularity
[00:10:33.066 --> 00:10:39.208]  That Ray Kurzweil talks about, but of course he is packaging it as if it's some beautiful, wonderful thing.
[00:10:39.228 --> 00:10:42.789]  It will be the end of this species on our current course.
[00:10:42.869 --> 00:10:50.912]  We are facing, we are facing assured, mutually assured destruction.
[00:10:50.932 --> 00:10:57.995]  And the Globalist and the program they have released, I've calculated it from every angle, is going to bring them down as well.
[00:10:58.415 --> 00:11:00.996]  And they've shown a complete disregard for the planet's safety.
[00:11:02.574 --> 00:11:21.259]  While at the same time lecturing everyone all day about how they want to protect the Earth, and then they target things that they know actually just goes after human activity, and not the super-sciences, and that's a science fiction term from 80 years ago, but now today we do see the super-sciences.
[00:11:22.199 --> 00:11:29.401]  Things that would have been considered magic just a hundred years ago are now real and bonafide and unfolding in front of us.
[00:11:32.295 --> 00:11:33.476]  Let me tell you who's coming up today.
[00:11:33.516 --> 00:11:34.436]  Colonel Craig Roberts.
[00:11:34.957 --> 00:11:35.977]  Hadn't been on in about a year.
[00:11:36.598 --> 00:11:37.818]  Always extremely informative.
[00:11:37.859 --> 00:11:38.679]  He's going to be joining us.
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:46.084]  Ron Paul and Webster Griffin Tarpley from Tripoli to give us reports on what's happening there.
[00:11:46.104 --> 00:11:49.946]  He will be joining us today as well.
[00:11:51.147 --> 00:11:58.812]  Again, if you just tuned in, I'm very hoarse from leading a citizen filibuster
[00:12:00.552 --> 00:12:20.119]  inside of the capitol yesterday for about two and a half hours and it was a much bigger turnout than even we had a month ago pretty much spontaneously with about twenty four hours notice or less than twenty four hours notice actually so I wasn't even sure Sunday we'd do it by the end of the show I was quasi sure than I announced it at eleven a.m.
[00:12:20.139 --> 00:12:25.421]  yesterday that we would be going down there and it is a morass of government deception and dirty tricks but
[00:12:26.261 --> 00:12:34.687]  By investigating this, it's like a medical procedure, that's why they call, doctors call themselves practitioners, and they call their medical practice a practice.
[00:12:35.487 --> 00:12:45.254]  And what they're saying is hidden in plain view, that they practice the art of medicine, and that they learn from it, and everything is a learning process.
[00:12:45.274 --> 00:12:49.757]  The Pentagon calls all these wars laboratories, live fire laboratories.
[00:12:52.421 --> 00:12:54.323]  That's why I say resistance is victory.
[00:12:54.763 --> 00:13:10.996]  The act of marching in and letting the state police and letting the state reps know that you're the boss and not cowering and calling government officials or authorities or excellencies, calling them servants and learning your own power is like building muscle.
[00:13:11.056 --> 00:13:12.617]  It's like lifting weights politically.
[00:13:12.637 --> 00:13:16.200]  If you lay there on the couch, you're gonna, you know, get heart disease when you're 30.
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:21.084]  If you lay there your whole life and don't do anything but, you know, not take care of yourself.
[00:13:22.236 --> 00:13:31.827]  But if you're politically active, most people are like, you have such incredible courage to march in and go into Perry's office and scream at them and go into other people, other globalist offices and do this.
[00:13:31.887 --> 00:13:33.189]  And aren't you scared of this?
[00:13:33.249 --> 00:13:33.970]  Aren't you scared of that?
[00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:35.792]  They told us we couldn't film in the Senate gallery.
[00:13:35.812 --> 00:13:37.674]  I said, this is the press gallery.
[00:13:37.994 --> 00:13:39.216]  There's no rule against that.
[00:13:39.736 --> 00:13:41.819]  And the guy said, OK, well, I'm going to go get the police.
[00:13:41.839 --> 00:13:42.680]  And I said, go get them.
[00:13:43.857 --> 00:13:47.060]  I mean at a certain point you've just got, and that's not courage.
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:53.507]  I'm not at Bunker Hill with redcoats marching up, lowering guns saying, leave the field or we're going to shoot you.
[00:13:53.948 --> 00:13:56.110]  And then they stood there and let the redcoats shoot them.
[00:13:56.771 --> 00:13:59.694]  Let me tell you, please don't tell me I've got courage.
[00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:01.740]  Please!
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:09.743]  I mean, like somebody at Iwo Jima marching up hills with artillery firing at them and machine guns.
[00:14:09.783 --> 00:14:23.008]  I mean, it is not courage to go into my servants, when they are behaving badly, and not following the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, common sense, common law, and the people's will, to go in and get in their face!
[00:14:23.469 --> 00:14:24.649]  It is the minimum!
[00:14:25.129 --> 00:14:26.130]  The minimum!
[00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:29.011]  So it quite frankly disgusts me.
[00:14:30.489 --> 00:14:32.571]  When folks come up and tell me how wonderful I am.
[00:14:33.332 --> 00:14:34.414]  You don't disgust me.
[00:14:34.594 --> 00:14:40.501]  It disgusts me to be being... It's disgusting to have people calling me a hero.
[00:14:40.561 --> 00:14:41.962]  Folks, I'm not a hero.
[00:14:42.883 --> 00:14:43.264]  Okay?
[00:14:43.604 --> 00:14:44.305]  I'm doing my duty.
[00:14:45.293 --> 00:14:57.798]  A fireman, a fireperson to be politically correct, that goes into a burning building and they die all the time to save a child, goes up in an apartment building or a facility and the roof falls in on them, that's a hero.
[00:14:58.418 --> 00:14:58.718]  Okay?
[00:14:59.038 --> 00:14:59.998]  That's a hero.
[00:15:00.619 --> 00:15:01.839]  Not doing my duty.
[00:15:01.879 --> 00:15:07.981]  See, we've turned just doing the minimum of what an American is supposed to act like into a hero.
[00:15:08.181 --> 00:15:08.361]  No!
[00:15:08.422 --> 00:15:08.462]  No!
[00:15:08.482 --> 00:15:08.522]  No!
[00:15:09.502 --> 00:15:09.682]  No!
[00:15:15.791 --> 00:15:34.101]  A single mother who quits drinking and quits smoking and works three jobs to take care of her children because her husband's dead or in prison, and who breaks her back to raise those children and to make sure that they get into the middle class and are good, decent people.
[00:15:34.121 --> 00:15:35.241]  And there's been a lot of those cases.
[00:15:35.281 --> 00:15:35.862]  That's a hero.
[00:15:36.633 --> 00:15:45.684]  Let me tell you something, as good as I am, ladies and gentlemen, I like to chew tobacco, I like to drink whiskey, and I have, I'll be honest with you, I have constant struggles.
[00:15:46.644 --> 00:15:51.709]  Constant struggles after a long day to not want to put a big thing, a red man in.
[00:15:52.329 --> 00:15:54.071]  Yeah, I'm from Texas, folks.
[00:15:54.111 --> 00:15:54.692]  I'm a redneck.
[00:15:55.472 --> 00:15:58.095]  And to, you know, get a bottle of Jack Daniels.
[00:15:58.235 --> 00:16:06.122]  I don't even have the self-control, the self-control of a single mother to focus.
[00:16:07.457 --> 00:16:23.592]  Despite the incredible mission I've got and the whole world counting on me more and more to be the leader of a movement against tyranny, I'm telling you there are people better and stronger and more intelligent and more enlightened than I am.
[00:16:26.835 --> 00:16:27.236]  I mean, I...
[00:16:28.993 --> 00:16:31.595]  I realize the response, and I want to talk about myself because I got all this news.
[00:16:31.655 --> 00:16:36.458]  It's just, it's just to have hundreds of people coming up with light in their eyes, just telling me how great I am.
[00:16:37.459 --> 00:16:43.963]  It made me feel good, but for them, and I'm proud of myself at many levels.
[00:16:44.003 --> 00:16:49.987]  I've got a lot of good attributes, but my point is don't look to one person to be the answer to things.
[00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:53.221]  At the same time, I don't even drink that much.
[00:16:53.601 --> 00:16:57.443]  Point is, I can go six months without it, and then start doing it, and then, man, this isn't good, I'm gonna quit.
[00:16:57.783 --> 00:17:02.185]  The point is, I'm weak, and I wonder how other people can just have total control.
[00:17:03.211 --> 00:17:05.573]  But some people have weaknesses that other folks don't have.
[00:17:05.594 --> 00:17:07.115]  Other people have weaknesses that you don't have.
[00:17:07.796 --> 00:17:09.177]  Or I can't control myself.
[00:17:09.297 --> 00:17:16.525]  I just pull directly into a steakhouse and get the biggest 30-ounce steak they've got and just cram it down with a big thing of cheese potatoes.
[00:17:18.467 --> 00:17:19.788]  All I'm saying is we're all human.
[00:17:20.329 --> 00:17:22.351]  But it's in that striving
[00:17:24.887 --> 00:17:26.268]  I mean, here's an example.
[00:17:26.528 --> 00:17:38.737]  I don't use a lot of profanity, but over the years working with a lot of other men, you know, it happens, and I catch myself sometimes on the phone in front of my children when I hear some news, and then, oh, I just taught my child a cuss word.
[00:17:40.178 --> 00:17:42.539]  You know, and it's a trap.
[00:17:42.819 --> 00:17:47.623]  See, the problem is people that are trying to be good, that have a conscience, we are bound down.
[00:17:49.469 --> 00:17:49.910]  I don't
[00:18:06.004 --> 00:18:20.110]  Because other people out there think it's cool to not have any morals, they think it's cool to do whatever they want to themselves, and they have no mooring, no rudder, they have no conscience, so of course they have no discernment.
[00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:34.076]  You have to realize how evil you are and how fallen and ugly you are to be able to recognize how beautiful and wonderful and enlightened and empowered you are.
[00:18:35.051 --> 00:18:46.945]  You've got to recognize your fallibility to be able to also recognize the magic that's in the world.
[00:18:47.866 --> 00:18:50.308]  By magic, I mean just the incredible goodness.
[00:18:51.089 --> 00:18:52.951]  But evil hides behind good.
[00:18:53.792 --> 00:18:55.654]  There's so much good, there's so much beauty,
[00:18:56.974 --> 00:19:01.875]  But I noticed the politicians, the media, you know, Obama's like, the birds are tweeting, the sun's out, things aren't so bad.
[00:19:02.875 --> 00:19:06.736]  They always try to archetypally, Texas is good because I'm Rick Perry.
[00:19:07.056 --> 00:19:08.056]  I made it good for you.
[00:19:08.477 --> 00:19:09.117]  I'm Obama.
[00:19:09.257 --> 00:19:10.317]  I made the sun shine.
[00:19:10.377 --> 00:19:11.277]  I made the birds sing.
[00:19:11.297 --> 00:19:15.298]  Remember a few months ago, he had this speech he was giving about, it's a beautiful day out here.
[00:19:15.338 --> 00:19:15.998]  We're doing good.
[00:19:16.038 --> 00:19:16.978]  We're doing good in America.
[00:19:17.919 --> 00:19:19.739]  And the idea is he's making it good.
[00:19:20.859 --> 00:19:23.160]  And so evil hides in complexity.
[00:19:24.172 --> 00:19:26.831]  That's the whole lawyer system of doublespeak and twisting.
[00:19:29.482 --> 00:19:31.823]  And then using that twisted spade to bury us.
[00:19:32.824 --> 00:19:34.984]  All right, I've gotten into philosophy and I shouldn't do it.
[00:19:35.645 --> 00:19:42.008]  It's just that I got particularly exhausted last night after two and a half hours of screaming and then coming up here and working and getting home past 11.
[00:19:42.828 --> 00:19:47.490]  And sometimes I've got to, after I'm really tired, I get in these reflective modes.
[00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:52.352]  I'm going to reset when we come back and get into the absolutely off-the-chart news.
[00:19:52.552 --> 00:19:55.274]  Dollar scene losing global reserve status.
[00:19:55.794 --> 00:19:56.994]  Financial times in London.
[00:19:58.855 --> 00:20:00.616]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.056 --> 00:20:06.677]  GCN listeners, why have you been hearing so much about Dermatol, the all-natural, all-purpose first aid spray?
[00:20:06.877 --> 00:20:10.718]  Because it's the must-have first aid product you need in your preparedness kit.
[00:20:10.979 --> 00:20:19.721]  Dermatol is made in America by Americans who know there's a more affordable, natural way to treat cuts, burns, bites, rashes, shingles, spoils, and many other skin problems.
[00:20:19.941 --> 00:20:25.323]  Dermatol is gentle enough for diaper rash, powerful enough for bed sores, and harmless to the eyes and mouth.
[00:20:25.503 --> 00:20:26.763]  It's great for the whole family.
[00:20:27.063 --> 00:20:28.004]  Even your family pets!
[00:20:28.244 --> 00:20:34.628]  Dermatol is antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, and not diminished by freezing, extreme heat, or years in storage.
[00:20:34.868 --> 00:20:38.351]  Dermatol is an absolute must for any first aid or preparedness kit.

[00:21:28.899 --> 00:21:30.300]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:34.862]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:21:35.042 --> 00:21:40.745]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold before your retirement.
[00:21:40.845 --> 00:21:44.267]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:21:44.487 --> 00:21:47.088]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:47.208 --> 00:21:52.111]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[00:21:59.294 --> 00:22:03.517]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:22:03.837 --> 00:22:04.457]  Number one.
[00:22:04.757 --> 00:22:07.899]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:22:08.179 --> 00:22:08.739]  Number two.
[00:22:09.039 --> 00:22:13.582]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:22:13.922 --> 00:22:14.382]  It's true.
[00:22:14.662 --> 00:22:19.225]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:22:19.525 --> 00:22:20.066]  Number 3.
[00:22:20.346 --> 00:22:23.650]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:22:23.951 --> 00:22:27.695]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:22:27.855 --> 00:22:28.416]  Number 4.
[00:22:28.656 --> 00:22:31.039]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:34.824]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:22:35.104 --> 00:22:35.304]  Number 5.
[00:22:35.885 --> 00:22:39.808]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:22:40.028 --> 00:22:44.812]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:22:45.072 --> 00:22:49.115]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:23:49.798 --> 00:23:50.278]  Again, that's 855-599-9444.
[00:23:50.498 --> 00:23:50.638]  It is...
[00:24:19.687 --> 00:24:26.369]  The bare minimum to be willing to risk your name, your treasure, and even your body in the fight against tyranny.
[00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:31.071]  Because you cannot commit your children to slavery.
[00:24:31.091 --> 00:24:34.993]  You cannot commit your society to the tyrants.
[00:24:35.033 --> 00:24:38.634]  You cannot turn your world over to bullies and the corrupt.
[00:24:39.234 --> 00:24:43.416]  That creates societies and civilizations that are nightmare.
[00:24:44.036 --> 00:24:46.537]  That turns loose the corrupt.
[00:24:48.038 --> 00:24:59.488]  And the wicked, the servile, the grasping, the sadistic, the psychopathic, the sociopaths.
[00:25:01.229 --> 00:25:10.517]  Now, before I get into this other news, the big news of the day that really struck me like a thunderbolt that I'll cover in the next segment.
[00:25:12.959 --> 00:25:13.439]  Then I'll get into TSA.
[00:25:16.232 --> 00:25:25.243]  Is a French news agency report with the headline, chemical in plastic containers makes male mice act like females.
[00:25:25.263 --> 00:25:29.948]  I think you've heard this before, but it's big breaking news now.
[00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:35.995]  Remember the George Soros publications, hundreds of them?
[00:25:37.225 --> 00:25:40.466]  Hundreds that came out in a campaign to try to discredit me last year.
[00:25:41.987 --> 00:25:43.607]  They thought that this would discredit me.
[00:25:43.987 --> 00:25:45.668]  All it did was tell more folks about the show.
[00:25:46.568 --> 00:25:48.969]  Headline juice boxes are making you gay.
[00:25:52.050 --> 00:26:03.574]  We have the government documents where they, we've made films about it where they said that they would put this in the products, in the food, in the water to reduce fertility but also change behavior.
[00:26:04.554 --> 00:26:05.575]  And it's the biggest reason
[00:26:06.727 --> 00:26:10.509]  Women, there's a cocktail of reasons, are dying of breast cancer.
[00:26:10.589 --> 00:26:19.335]  And I want to, instead of having marches and collecting money for breast cancer, the system at the highest levels knows why breast cancer is off the charts.
[00:26:19.515 --> 00:26:22.977]  They know why prostate cancer is off the charts.
[00:26:23.077 --> 00:26:30.722]  They know because these are all areas where sex hormones cause mutations in the tissues.
[00:26:30.902 --> 00:26:33.003]  And they knew this in the 1930s.
[00:26:33.043 --> 00:26:35.105]  This has been done deliberately.
[00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:44.514]  There's hundreds of different major calculations, formulas for plastics that don't leach these, and they're killings.
[00:26:46.355 --> 00:26:49.217]  And so I'll get into this in more detail coming up in the next segment.
[00:26:51.553 --> 00:27:14.278]  And see, if people could just realize this and read John P. Holdren's book, read the different eugenicist publications, read the stuff that came out 70, 80 years ago, the different reports that we cover here where they said they would do this to us, and then if you actually consciously realize that if you're a cop, you're with the people, you're being attacked as well, or if you're a bureaucrat,
[00:27:16.105 --> 00:27:20.373]  I will bet you money that Rick Perry is not warned about all these things by the establishment.
[00:27:20.935 --> 00:27:22.758]  Once he's president, if that happens, they may.
[00:27:22.778 --> 00:27:24.401]  99.9% of us are targeted by this.
[00:27:28.237 --> 00:27:30.618]  Through the compartmentalized scientific dictatorship.
[00:27:30.958 --> 00:27:35.679]  And, well, I mean, here's one headline dealing with it out of a French news agency.
[00:27:36.099 --> 00:27:36.679]  Here's another one.
[00:27:36.739 --> 00:27:40.060]  Worldwide diabetes more than doubled since 1980.
[00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:41.681]  Well, we told you that years ago.
[00:27:41.721 --> 00:27:45.362]  It's actually up four-fold in, quote, Hispanics.
[00:27:46.542 --> 00:27:55.785]  And that's because the different, again, cocktails, the right word of things added to the food, is race-specific.
[00:27:56.918 --> 00:27:59.841]  And it's HIV.
[00:28:01.402 --> 00:28:05.565]  Northern Europeans do not have coupler points for the virus.
[00:28:06.566 --> 00:28:10.189]  It's nearly impossible for Northern Europeans to get it.
[00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:12.591]  And that came out in the 80s, of course.
[00:28:12.631 --> 00:28:13.392]  They knew that then.
[00:28:13.752 --> 00:28:16.214]  That's in medical journals, literally hundreds of different studies.
[00:28:16.895 --> 00:28:18.236]  It's a race-specific weapon as well.
[00:28:21.067 --> 00:28:33.943]  So if you like being targeted, because the globalists are racist, but they pose as liberals, and they run all the programs and finance all the quote minority leadership councils.
[00:28:35.014 --> 00:28:35.134]  Any
[00:28:53.015 --> 00:28:55.257]  These sewage treatment that's dumped into lakes.
[00:28:55.277 --> 00:29:00.602]  This is always in lakes and rivers that are having treated sewage dumped into them.
[00:29:01.183 --> 00:29:02.444]  Here's Discovery News.
[00:29:02.464 --> 00:29:04.906]  You can get literally thousands of reports on this all over the world.
[00:29:05.367 --> 00:29:07.589]  More hermaphrodite fish in US rivers.
[00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:10.271]  And that's what I said at the time.
[00:29:12.435 --> 00:29:14.036]  You see, for me, it's all scientific.
[00:29:14.477 --> 00:29:21.923]  I'm not here attacking people because they're attracted, a woman's attracted to a woman, a man's attracted to a man.
[00:29:22.463 --> 00:29:30.310]  I'm here telling you that in cultures and history, there has been some of that, but in lower numbers.
[00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:36.335]  Regardless of a moral point, I'm not even debating that so I can get through to you.
[00:29:39.017 --> 00:29:45.783]  It's being scientifically done now, and we have the government documents, so you should know why this is happening.
[00:29:46.524 --> 00:29:48.106]  It's happening to the animals as well.
[00:29:48.406 --> 00:29:49.487]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:50.388 --> 00:29:51.289]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.789 --> 00:29:53.391]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.332 --> 00:29:56.995]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.011 --> 00:30:04.254]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:30:04.574 --> 00:30:05.174]  Number 1.
[00:30:05.475 --> 00:30:08.637]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:08.897 --> 00:30:09.457]  Number 2.
[00:30:09.758 --> 00:30:14.321]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:14.661 --> 00:30:15.101]  It's true.
[00:30:15.401 --> 00:30:19.964]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:20.265 --> 00:30:20.805]  Number 3.
[00:30:21.105 --> 00:30:24.387]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:24.687 --> 00:30:28.390]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:29.131]  Number 4.
[00:30:29.371 --> 00:30:31.753]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:30:32.133 --> 00:30:35.516]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:35.816 --> 00:30:36.037]  Number 5.
[00:30:36.617 --> 00:30:40.540]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:30:40.761 --> 00:30:45.525]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:30:45.805 --> 00:30:49.826]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:49.966 --> 00:30:51.527]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:51.767 --> 00:30:53.848]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:30:54.008 --> 00:30:56.608]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:30:56.628 --> 00:31:05.691]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:31:06.932 --> 00:31:11.673]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:31:12.073 --> 00:31:14.034]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[00:31:16.141 --> 00:31:27.002]  Well they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you love the way they fit
[00:31:29.281 --> 00:31:33.164]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:31:33.884 --> 00:31:36.967]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[00:31:37.707 --> 00:31:38.528]  Others don't.
[00:31:38.948 --> 00:31:40.829]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:31:41.089 --> 00:31:42.591]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[00:31:42.871 --> 00:31:45.433]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:31:45.753 --> 00:31:52.017]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:31:52.397 --> 00:31:54.599]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:31:55.099 --> 00:31:57.121]  Diamond gusset jeans got it.
[00:31:57.461 --> 00:31:58.322]  Others don't.
[00:32:00.839 --> 00:32:09.366]  The folks at eFoodsDirect have saved you from the huge price increases on food by buying raw materials ahead and packing your supplies themselves.
[00:32:09.847 --> 00:32:13.930]  They haven't increased their prices on great long-term food reserves since last year.
[00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:19.495]  With the rising cost of raw materials and gas prices, they can't hold off any longer.
[00:32:20.155 --> 00:32:28.166]  As of July 1st, Ifoo's Direct is forced to increase their prices so they can still ship you the best storable food on the planet.
[00:32:28.486 --> 00:32:33.953]  Until the end of June, you can lock in the cost of your food at last year's prices by calling 800-409-5633.
[00:32:37.678 --> 00:32:44.060]  Your time is running out to build your supply with the best food on the planet at last year's prices with eFoods Direct.
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:47.141]  Call 800-409-5633.
[00:32:47.601 --> 00:32:49.481]  Prices go up at the end of June.

[00:32:52.662 --> 00:32:58.704]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[00:33:01.525 --> 00:33:02.265]  Big Brother.
[00:33:03.225 --> 00:33:04.386]  Mainstream Media.
[00:33:05.552 --> 00:33:06.693]  Government cover-ups.
[00:33:07.313 --> 00:33:08.794]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:33:09.415 --> 00:33:10.756]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:11.556 --> 00:33:16.299]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:20.182 --> 00:33:24.745]  You know, I talk about news coming in so fast we can't even cover it anymore.
[00:33:26.226 --> 00:33:29.988]  And I know that Matt Grudge, because he's tweeted it,
[00:33:33.223 --> 00:33:39.948]  He's a listener of the radio show and I don't, I rarely ask Drudge to link to something because he already links to us so much.
[00:33:40.008 --> 00:33:43.670]  It's more than I could ever, ever, you know, even ask for.
[00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:51.456]  I mean, it's, it's literally like, you know, the god of internet, Zeus, throwing down the lightning bolt, you know, and giving it to man.
[00:33:52.156 --> 00:33:53.557]  There is no bigger news site.
[00:33:53.577 --> 00:33:56.059]  There is no site that drives and sets agendas like Drudge.
[00:33:57.301 --> 00:33:59.963]  And he is fighting the TSA, he is exposing the world government.
[00:34:00.703 --> 00:34:17.273]  He literally has done more for the movement against tyranny than any other source I can think of because he's legitimized our reportage, other reportage, he links to European mainline news about world government, and he's forced mainline conservative radio to start admitting this stuff in the last three years.
[00:34:18.622 --> 00:34:45.758]  and uh... the fox pundits the rest of it uh... and the fact that he's breaking the back of the tsa with the rest of the citizenry together uh... but i i well actually i'm not going to get into it but i'm i'm i may even reach out on this and i need to during the next break because this news that i just read during the break is so big it's been out for thirty minutes it's at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com and it turns out uh... in the article
[00:34:48.581 --> 00:34:59.092]  And so even if Drudge links to us so much, he's welcome to link to TG Daily or obviously EPIC, the Electronic Privacy Information Center.
[00:34:59.532 --> 00:35:00.433]  Got the documents.
[00:35:04.377 --> 00:35:07.500]  WUSA-TV and DC's covering it.
[00:35:08.401 --> 00:35:11.264]  It turns out in Boston and with four other airports since
[00:35:14.817 --> 00:35:42.216]  2003, they've had body scanners, and it turns out, this is just so off the chart, that they've known all along that it was giving them cancer, and that they went ahead and ordered them for all the rest of the major airports, 214 nationwide, and here's the headline, Cancer Surgeon Body Scanner Operators, TSA Launches Cover-Up, and the documents have now been leaked
[00:35:42.976 --> 00:35:48.401]  And they're confirmed to be accurate by Epic that the TSA knowingly covered this up.
[00:35:49.001 --> 00:35:51.063]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, it's even been in the New York Times.
[00:35:51.183 --> 00:36:01.312]  Top scientists who helped develop these systems came out and said the radiation, depending on the machine, is 20 to 50 times what they told you, and that it's not even so much people that go through it,
[00:36:01.992 --> 00:36:02.893]  A few times a year.
[00:36:02.973 --> 00:36:03.634]  That's bad.
[00:36:04.274 --> 00:36:05.876]  But it's being around these.
[00:36:05.896 --> 00:36:08.538]  I mean, these put off more radiation than a dental x-ray.
[00:36:08.559 --> 00:36:10.160]  We've had radiologists on to break it down.
[00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:12.783]  And that's a dentist goes and gets behind a lead wall.
[00:36:13.715 --> 00:36:21.703]  When my dad does x-rays, or the dental assistants do, they go and get behind a lead wall, and they put lead shielding over your chest and genitals.
[00:36:22.143 --> 00:36:29.910]  And you notice the thickest part of the shielding goes over your waist, because that's thin skin to the testicles, and it can go right in.
[00:36:30.671 --> 00:36:36.176]  And as you would expect, they're getting testicular cancer, they're getting brain cancers, it's killing them.
[00:36:37.162 --> 00:36:40.103]  And, again, this is all part of the plan.
[00:36:40.143 --> 00:36:49.928]  I've had top scientists on, like Dr. Busby, saying that many of the globalists in Europe know that radiation levels are going up all over the place, but they don't care because it reduces fertility.
[00:36:49.948 --> 00:36:50.688]  This is a plan.
[00:36:51.809 --> 00:36:58.012]  And there was a couple of former TSA people at the protest at the Capitol yesterday, one lady and one man.
[00:36:58.432 --> 00:37:00.113]  There was a Homeland Security ICE agent.
[00:37:00.153 --> 00:37:00.873]  He gave me his card.
[00:37:00.893 --> 00:37:01.453]  I looked him up.
[00:37:01.493 --> 00:37:02.013]  There he is.
[00:37:02.654 --> 00:37:03.914]  But he said, hey, I'm American, too.
[00:37:03.954 --> 00:37:04.915]  I'm allowed to come protest.
[00:37:07.119 --> 00:37:11.689]  I mean, it blew me away and they said, no, everything you said about the TSA is true.
[00:37:11.709 --> 00:37:16.218]  And they said, you know, uh, that they quit over it, but.
[00:37:18.407 --> 00:37:19.788]  This is so off the charts.
[00:37:20.269 --> 00:37:22.630]  Cancer surges in body scanner operators.
[00:37:23.051 --> 00:37:24.512]  TSA launches cover-up.
[00:37:25.273 --> 00:37:27.274]  And there's no doubt this just came out.
[00:37:27.534 --> 00:37:31.938]  Watson ferreted the news and saw it in different regionals and put a boil-down article together.
[00:37:31.978 --> 00:37:33.759]  But I don't even care.
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:36.261]  Now that I think about it, Drudge doesn't have to link to us.
[00:37:36.602 --> 00:37:38.103]  I'm sure he'll link to some of these articles.
[00:37:38.923 --> 00:37:42.206]  But cancer surges in body scanner operations.
[00:37:42.266 --> 00:37:43.948]  TSA launches cover-up.
[00:37:44.827 --> 00:37:48.275]  This is so, this is so huge.
[00:37:49.057 --> 00:37:53.828]  In fact, I can just get on my iPhone here right now, live.
[00:37:59.530 --> 00:38:03.991]  That's another radiation killer right there, where they knew 25 years ago what it was going to do.
[00:38:04.331 --> 00:38:06.312]  They're just giving us devices that kill us.
[00:38:07.012 --> 00:38:09.032]  But a cell phone compared to these scanners is nothing.
[00:38:09.372 --> 00:38:10.873]  But in the aggregate, it's like a cigarette.
[00:38:11.553 --> 00:38:13.834]  That's even what the EU's had to admit, their health ministers.
[00:38:15.854 --> 00:38:17.395]  Again, government doesn't have total control.
[00:38:17.455 --> 00:38:26.618]  It was the EU Medical Board came out a year and a half ago, two years ago now, and said this whole swine flu thing's fake, the vaccine's deadly, and then later that was confirmed to be true.
[00:38:27.639 --> 00:38:35.022]  We had the head of it, Wolfgang Wudarg, Dr. Wudarg on to break it down, and the EU has also come out and said it's like smoking cigarettes.
[00:38:35.222 --> 00:38:37.103]  You do it over and over again, cell phones.
[00:38:37.583 --> 00:38:42.365]  In fact, they found in some of the studies, it may be worse than smoking cigarettes.
[00:38:43.922 --> 00:38:49.626]  And then you add to it the GMO, you add to it the bisphenol A and other chemicals that are in the plastics.
[00:38:51.767 --> 00:38:52.828]  This is so incredible.
[00:38:52.948 --> 00:39:01.574]  I mean, we already knew this, but to have it confirmed that they cold-bloodedly know that it's a death sentence for all those people.
[00:39:03.109 --> 00:39:06.272]  This TSA thing is key in the whole globalist operation.
[00:39:06.312 --> 00:39:07.993]  It's about stomping on the state's rights.
[00:39:08.473 --> 00:39:13.357]  It's about training you to be a prisoner and to be humiliated and have your private parts touched.
[00:39:14.238 --> 00:39:16.080]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, I've talked a lot about this.
[00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:26.028]  I remember going on dates in high school and, you know, taking a girl to the movie theater and, you know, having them reach over and
[00:39:27.498 --> 00:39:28.159]  Touch on you.
[00:39:28.439 --> 00:39:29.480]  And it was electrifying.
[00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:36.248]  It was almost, you know, it was all I mean, you liked it, but it was also kind of kind of freaky.
[00:39:36.728 --> 00:39:43.756]  Can you imagine what it's like to have people you don't know in a public setting grabbing you and actually squeezing?
[00:39:44.156 --> 00:39:48.321]  That's why they've had on record airline pilots, military veterans, U.S.
[00:39:48.361 --> 00:39:49.082]  troops coming home.
[00:39:50.553 --> 00:39:54.596]  Um, having their space violated, having their basic humanity.
[00:39:55.116 --> 00:39:57.238]  And that's why troops have gotten angry and been arrested.
[00:39:57.258 --> 00:40:01.881]  Uh, they've thrown up, uh, airline pilots have had refused to fly and gone home.
[00:40:01.921 --> 00:40:07.064]  It's been in the news and thrown up in their parking lot when they get home and people like, well, you're a wimp.
[00:40:07.164 --> 00:40:09.526]  No, it's because you're not a wimp that you can't handle it.
[00:40:10.086 --> 00:40:10.906]  It's your dignity.
[00:40:12.187 --> 00:40:12.568]  I mean, um,
[00:40:18.201 --> 00:40:20.864]  It's sexual assault.
[00:40:21.104 --> 00:40:32.373]  That's why under common law and common sense in every culture, you get killed for going up and grabbing on a woman or grabbing her genitals, you know, in the woods out by the well a thousand years ago.
[00:40:32.914 --> 00:40:37.638]  The town would get together and take you and have a trial and hang you high just for grabbing on a woman.
[00:40:38.615 --> 00:40:40.056]  Because you don't touch people.
[00:40:40.276 --> 00:40:43.358]  This is about your personal space.
[00:40:43.418 --> 00:40:44.338]  It's about mating.
[00:40:44.618 --> 00:40:46.139]  It's about choices you make.
[00:40:46.559 --> 00:40:47.660]  You leave people alone.
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:48.580]  This is a big deal.
[00:40:48.941 --> 00:40:50.361]  So it's about 10th Amendment violating.
[00:40:50.401 --> 00:40:51.542]  It's about training us to be slaves.
[00:40:51.562 --> 00:40:52.583]  It's about getting in our person.
[00:40:53.023 --> 00:40:54.524]  And it's about creating an army of people.
[00:40:54.544 --> 00:41:02.228]  And we reported over a year ago, and then had internal sources, and it was later confirmed in mainstream media, that they called TSA in and said, you have a concern about radiation.
[00:41:03.342 --> 00:41:05.483]  And if you say yes, they give you a pink slip in two weeks.
[00:41:06.684 --> 00:41:07.564]  And don't even tell you why.
[00:41:07.604 --> 00:41:09.565]  They say it's a layoff, even though they're hiring.
[00:41:10.246 --> 00:41:12.407]  If you have a trouble groping people, you're fired.
[00:41:12.467 --> 00:41:14.828]  So it's kind of like panning for gold.
[00:41:15.628 --> 00:41:18.990]  They see people that are stupid or tyrants or pedophiles.
[00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:21.311]  It's a spectrum that they're panning for.
[00:41:21.852 --> 00:41:26.254]  They see all the people that are decent as like dirt, as rocks they want to get rid of.
[00:41:26.894 --> 00:41:32.097]  And the little gold chunks they're panning for in the stream of employees are the folks that'll do this.
[00:41:33.595 --> 00:41:40.084]  They're people that will sit there baking, baking around the scanners all day long.
[00:41:40.985 --> 00:41:48.436]  And this story is so big and so huge, and everything else I've got so big and so huge, I don't even know what to say.
[00:41:48.456 --> 00:41:49.437]  I'm going to say it again.
[00:41:50.452 --> 00:41:52.073]  And it's all part of a conditioning process.
[00:41:52.093 --> 00:41:53.194]  This is psychological warfare.
[00:41:53.214 --> 00:42:07.525]  We're supposed to just learn that they, 11 years ago, signed a secret deal with major insurance companies, the Pentagon did, to take all the death benefits from troops when they die and don't give their widows or widowers the money that they paid into out of their check for decades.
[00:42:08.615 --> 00:42:09.717]  That's just hiding in plain view.
[00:42:09.737 --> 00:42:10.478]  Nobody gets in trouble.
[00:42:12.222 --> 00:42:13.664]  The big bank heads steal trillions.
[00:42:13.684 --> 00:42:14.445]  They don't go to jail.
[00:42:14.986 --> 00:42:20.456]  But then some low-level guy at Citibank steals $19 million because he stole from the bank.
[00:42:21.037 --> 00:42:21.718]  He gets indicted.
[00:42:22.665 --> 00:42:23.606]  That's how they operate.
[00:42:24.246 --> 00:42:31.510]  Or they bust Blagojevich for engaging in standard corruption, boss hog stuff, but then when Kissinger openly says the U.S.
[00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:38.014]  policy is genocide against the third world, we're going to kill him, in State Department memorandum 200, he's, oh, that's humanitarian.
[00:42:38.914 --> 00:42:41.696]  Or Holdren writes books like this, and it's, oh, that's humanitarian.
[00:42:42.056 --> 00:42:48.280]  So the big flaming crimes, like huge bonfires of obviousness, that's not a problem.
[00:42:49.406 --> 00:42:58.455]  And they cold-bloodedly, because remember it was four airports starting in late 2002 into 2003, and pull those articles up, were testing the body scanners.
[00:42:58.895 --> 00:43:05.041]  And so now they've got seven years, in some cases seven and a half, at Boston, Logan and others,
[00:43:05.842 --> 00:43:18.732]  Where these went in, where they have cancer clusters, and the TSA people that have worked there for years are dying, and it's like when, you know, they go to a town, they wonder why everybody, you know, people in a certain neighborhood have double, triple cancer, and it's more than that in these studies.
[00:43:19.252 --> 00:43:27.658]  They go, we better test the soil, and they go, oh, some company before this subdivision was built dumped dioxin into the soil.
[00:43:27.918 --> 00:43:30.981]  There was a factory here, and the developers didn't tell you.
[00:43:31.994 --> 00:43:33.295]  And you know about the Love Canal?
[00:43:33.335 --> 00:43:35.758]  There's thousands of these Superfund sites.
[00:43:36.539 --> 00:43:37.600]  Much of Houston is one.
[00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:42.805]  That's why Houston has much higher cancer rates per capita than any other city in the United States.
[00:43:43.686 --> 00:43:51.253]  New Orleans is next because of all the toxic waste that runs into the Mississippi from the Midwest and then down there.
[00:43:53.836 --> 00:43:54.477]  It's incredible.
[00:43:55.498 --> 00:43:56.118]  It's incredible.
[00:43:56.198 --> 00:44:01.439]  And there's this cutthroat attitude by the establishment that, hey, it's all social Darwinism, let everybody die.
[00:44:01.679 --> 00:44:03.520]  But then I see it even affecting the elites.
[00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:08.761]  It's like a nihilistic psycho madman.
[00:44:09.961 --> 00:44:20.243]  I mean, this is madness to cold-bloodedly know that with even just a few years of the scanners and in previous studies when they were developing, the government studied everything.
[00:44:21.701 --> 00:44:25.243]  90% of research and development at universities is under DARPA alone now.
[00:44:29.344 --> 00:44:34.426]  An example, they knew bisphenol A combinations in major studies you can pull up in the 1940s.
[00:44:35.246 --> 00:44:40.368]  They were looking for a plastic liner that would reduce fertility but also male aggression.
[00:44:41.755 --> 00:44:47.026]  And then there's all these white papers on it that we've republished at Infowars from the Rockefeller Foundation, UN, and others.
[00:44:47.046 --> 00:44:51.074]  And then they get it deployed, and then they even do...
[00:44:53.570 --> 00:45:02.936]  Rebates and things to factories and companies to then make sure that Bisphenol A was adopted in the majority of plastic formulas.
[00:45:03.897 --> 00:45:09.020]  If you wanted a formula from Dow Chemical, you can research this, or other companies that develop these systems.
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:12.202]  There's a whole class of plastics that have the Bisphenol A in them.
[00:45:13.443 --> 00:45:14.424]  It's in printer ink.
[00:45:14.464 --> 00:45:17.386]  It's probably in this printer ink right here, but I'm too dumb to check and stop it.
[00:45:18.146 --> 00:45:19.387]  It's infertility everywhere.
[00:45:21.799 --> 00:45:24.661]  And then they'll only give the license to factories for this.
[00:45:25.881 --> 00:45:36.729]  So they'll sub-license it to the Chinese, the Indians, the Mexicans, you know, sub-companies in the United States and Europe, knowing they went and found it, then wrote white papers on it.
[00:45:36.869 --> 00:45:37.990]  We've written articles about this.
[00:45:38.330 --> 00:45:47.137]  Then they deploy it, and then now decades later, a French news agency, Chemical and Plastic Containers, makes male mice act like females.
[00:45:48.519 --> 00:46:00.710]  And then they had George Soros-funded groups come out last year, literally hundreds of articles over a month period, thinking it would hurt me, taking out of context what I said, saying juice boxes are making you gay.
[00:46:01.371 --> 00:46:10.359]  Although I was reading studies on air that it's causing hermaphrodite developments in fetal brains of mammals.
[00:46:12.696 --> 00:46:19.759]  You know, not just the genitals, but in the brain, and that's what's causing sexual confusion.
[00:46:20.339 --> 00:46:26.821]  And that's, again, coldly, it's not an issue of your identity.
[00:46:28.001 --> 00:46:34.904]  And they do this to you, then they have a media system that says it's your identity, you know, everybody needs to be nice to people.
[00:46:34.924 --> 00:46:35.704]  Well, absolutely.
[00:46:37.113 --> 00:46:46.937]  People should be nice to you, and the religious folks shouldn't even be attacking people, because separately from even a religious debate, this has been done to you.
[00:46:49.657 --> 00:46:52.919]  This has been done to you.
[00:46:54.899 --> 00:47:01.802]  And then you'll watch the George Soros crowds, the chemical engineer promoters, they'll come out and attack this again, because I'm here telling you.
[00:47:01.822 --> 00:47:05.963]  I mean, is it homophobic to say that these mice had this done to them?
[00:47:07.443 --> 00:47:30.300]  No, it's a scientific discussion of how to create infertility and to stop the males and females merging and producing more offspring for a global program of depopulation that your choice has been taken away from you and this has been done because it affects the brain, it affects the different endocrine systems, it affects the genitals to the point of that all over the world
[00:47:31.161 --> 00:47:40.866]  In some major studies, upwards of half of the fish and frogs and other amphibians, including reptiles like snakes, have both sexual organs.
[00:47:43.107 --> 00:47:54.073]  It's so pronounced, just what's going into the water, as runoff in the embryonic development in the eggs of the fish and the frogs that this is happening.
[00:47:54.915 --> 00:48:02.819]  Now, mammals are bigger and tougher, but it's... and their study... this was all done, okay?
[00:48:03.519 --> 00:48:09.802]  And the point is, if this has been done to you and you like it, that's because that's now your chemical physiology.
[00:48:09.842 --> 00:48:11.202]  You've been re-engineered.
[00:48:11.302 --> 00:48:13.123]  I'm not making a moral statement on it.
[00:48:14.364 --> 00:48:15.504]  Get past the mind control.
[00:48:16.424 --> 00:48:23.608]  I'm saying to you, do you understand that this is a public plan and has been done?
[00:48:24.855 --> 00:48:37.760]  Male mice who were exposed as babies to BPA, a chemical common in canned foods and plastic containers, it lines the tin cans, everything, act more like females and are seen as less desirable mates, a U.S.
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:39.341]  study shows Monday.
[00:48:40.509 --> 00:48:50.820]  The findings should have implications on how BPA and Bisphenol A may affect human development and behavior, and the study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:52.262]  That is the most prestigious.
[00:48:52.922 --> 00:48:57.487]  The BPA-exposed deer mice in the study look normal, but there's nothing obviously wrong with them.
[00:48:57.527 --> 00:49:00.210]  Yet, they are clearly different, said the lead author.
[00:49:01.010 --> 00:49:11.798]  At the University of Missouri, females do not want the mate BPA-exposed male, because they're giving off different pheromones, they're giving off a female pheromone, and BPA-exposed males perform worse on spatial navigation tasks.
[00:49:11.858 --> 00:49:12.998]  It also stunts you.
[00:49:13.439 --> 00:49:14.860]  Development.
[00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:19.423]  You go to a restaurant, most of the boys now just look like mutant, brain-damaged people.
[00:49:19.563 --> 00:49:20.303]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[00:49:20.383 --> 00:49:21.865]  It's just, you know, it's hardcore.
[00:49:22.685 --> 00:49:36.324]  The girls are hyper-female, they're growing taller, they're growth hormone, they're having really a form of sub-acromegaly, and that's why the women, what, there's a quadrupling now in breast cancer in the last 20 years?
[00:49:37.566 --> 00:49:48.559]  Oh, yeah, let's just forget the whole obsession over, you know, men suddenly, you know, everywhere, and it is happening, and the media then saying, it's good, do it, do it, do it.
[00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:50.702]  You should know you're being chemically programmed.
[00:49:50.722 --> 00:49:55.408]  I'm not making a judgment about... because that's a distraction, okay?
[00:49:56.496 --> 00:49:58.097]  You understand, this is being done to you.
[00:49:58.377 --> 00:50:00.899]  Now, let's get off the sex stuff, because everybody gets obsessed with that.
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:08.525]  This also increases cancer in males, and there's literally thousands of these studies, going back to the 20s and 30s, and current ones, hundreds of current ones.
[00:50:09.246 --> 00:50:23.116]  Women, women, they're not going to tell you why you get that breast tumor, and why they then fry you with radiation and bug poison, known as chemo, and suck all the money out of you, and then you'll die, and you'll be put in a box.
[00:50:24.318 --> 00:50:29.949]  Let's get off the sex stuff now, because, you know, Soros will still twist that and that's fine, because people will actually find the truth.
[00:50:31.192 --> 00:50:35.834]  You need to know, women, that the males are feminized, you are hyper-feminized.
[00:50:35.854 --> 00:50:40.955]  That's why puberty was 13, 14, now on average it's 10 in the West, everywhere where this is done.
[00:50:41.576 --> 00:50:47.318]  And now some girls as young as 3, tens of thousands now by age 5 are going into puberty.
[00:50:47.618 --> 00:50:55.841]  You're hyper-aging as well, and the tissues that are affected more by this hyper-age, so you have the breast of a 95-year-old woman at 30.
[00:50:57.045 --> 00:50:58.806]  They've killed you, just like the TSA agents.
[00:50:58.846 --> 00:51:00.207]  I'm sorry they soft-killed most of us.
[00:51:00.247 --> 00:51:04.470]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:05.391]  Number one.
[00:51:05.691 --> 00:51:08.853]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:51:09.133 --> 00:51:09.694]  Number two.
[00:51:09.994 --> 00:51:14.537]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:51:14.877 --> 00:51:15.318]  It's true.
[00:51:15.618 --> 00:51:20.161]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:51:20.481 --> 00:51:21.021]  Number 3.
[00:51:21.301 --> 00:51:24.582]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:51:24.882 --> 00:51:28.583]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:51:28.803 --> 00:51:29.363]  Number 4.
[00:51:29.603 --> 00:51:31.964]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:51:32.364 --> 00:51:35.745]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:51:36.045 --> 00:51:36.245]  Number 5.
[00:51:36.825 --> 00:51:40.746]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:51:40.966 --> 00:51:45.727]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:52:01.235 --> 00:52:04.839]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:52:05.259 --> 00:52:08.263]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:52:08.483 --> 00:52:13.288]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:13.308 --> 00:52:19.555]  I have tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:19.695 --> 00:52:21.917]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:52:22.458 --> 00:52:22.738]  Tim Geithner?
[00:52:22.758 --> 00:52:23.178]  Bernanke?
[00:52:23.278 --> 00:52:24.039]  They're arsonists!
[00:52:24.079 --> 00:52:25.199]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:25.219 --> 00:52:27.461]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:41.368 --> 00:52:45.292]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[00:52:45.733 --> 00:52:48.276]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:52:48.636 --> 00:52:57.826]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv

[00:54:13.407 --> 00:54:22.111]  You know, people ask, why aren't Europeans, why aren't Americans having children?
[00:54:22.171 --> 00:54:24.312]  Why does Europe have a 1.3 replacement rate?
[00:54:24.332 --> 00:54:29.414]  You know, your granddaddy and grandma had your mom, your dad.
[00:54:33.769 --> 00:54:35.170]  They go out, they have children.
[00:54:35.610 --> 00:54:37.051]  They go out and meet people, marry them.
[00:54:37.711 --> 00:54:39.112]  Why aren't people having children?
[00:54:39.212 --> 00:54:40.673]  Why is fertility way down?
[00:54:41.194 --> 00:54:42.654]  Why is cancer off the chart?
[00:54:42.694 --> 00:54:44.175]  Why is diabetes off the chart?
[00:54:44.776 --> 00:54:45.976]  Why, uh, do...
[00:54:47.412 --> 00:54:49.473]  Are men looking more feminine?
[00:54:50.033 --> 00:54:51.895]  Behaving in feminine ways?
[00:54:51.955 --> 00:54:54.276]  Not acting the way males have always behaved?
[00:54:54.736 --> 00:54:57.658]  In Europe, they're passing laws where you're not allowed to call boys boys.
[00:54:58.138 --> 00:54:59.779]  At school, they're not allowing gender.
[00:55:00.459 --> 00:55:14.427]  It's because, and this is in the Globalist documents, and Aldous Huxley wrote about this in his non-fiction books, his brother headed up the program at the UN at UNESCO, Julian Huxley, that they would create a hermaphrodite drone that didn't even breed.
[00:55:16.092 --> 00:55:18.856]  I mean, truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:55:19.777 --> 00:55:23.321]  I'll just unplug my headset here, let me get it.
[00:55:27.627 --> 00:55:32.073]  And so, I had all this other news to cover, and I'll get into what happened with the TSA here in Texas.
[00:55:34.063 --> 00:55:48.835]  Here is the article by Paul Joseph Watson, Cancer Surges and Body Scanner Operators, TSA launches cover-up and they've finally been forced to release some of the NIST documents, but they've blacked out the radiation meter levels.
[00:55:50.206 --> 00:56:00.037]  Um, continuing, uh, they also have measurements of the type of radiation leaking outside of the containment facility, but then they spin it and say, but we say that's safe.
[00:56:00.758 --> 00:56:07.004]  But then all the other independent studies say it's not safe, and now we have reports of higher cancer rates and that the TSA
[00:56:07.825 --> 00:56:09.966]  Uh, is extremely concerned about all of this.
[00:56:10.507 --> 00:56:24.634]  Fearful of provoking further public resistance to naked airport body scanners, the TSA has been caught covering up a surge of cases in TSA workers developing cancer as a result of their close proximity to radiation firing devices.
[00:56:25.795 --> 00:56:29.037]  And again, this is classic lawyer speak in the document I scanned over earlier.
[00:56:30.362 --> 00:56:34.264]  NIST blacks out the numbers because they don't want other engineers ever seeing it and going, that's deadly.
[00:56:34.744 --> 00:56:35.825]  They block out the numbers.
[00:56:36.345 --> 00:56:37.646]  Then they say, oh, this is safe.
[00:56:37.686 --> 00:56:41.568]  But we did measure these numbers outside of the machine splattering.
[00:56:42.749 --> 00:56:46.371]  It's like the TSA saying, we didn't make that 95-year-old take her diaper off.
[00:56:46.731 --> 00:56:48.452]  We just said you can't fly if you don't.
[00:56:50.191 --> 00:56:52.993]  See, it's all these lawyer tricks.
[00:56:53.613 --> 00:57:00.517]  Perhaps the most shocking revelation to emerge from the latest Freedom of Information Act documents obtained by the Electronic Privacy Information Center.
[00:57:00.958 --> 00:57:15.386]  After union representatives at Boston discovered a cancer cluster amongst TSA workers linked with radiation from body scanners, the TSA sought to downplay the matter and refused to issue employees with dosimeters to measure levels of exposure.
[00:57:15.426 --> 00:57:16.707]  Now let's stop right there.
[00:57:17.307 --> 00:57:19.449]  It is federal and state law.
[00:57:20.467 --> 00:57:21.487]  I know, my dad's a dentist.
[00:57:21.967 --> 00:57:37.252]  But anybody that's been in a hospital or anywhere around x-ray machines, you know on record that there's a radiation officer, they have to wear the badge, they have to have groups come in every month, check the calibration of the machines, because they get off very often and will fry you.
[00:57:38.352 --> 00:57:43.273]  And you've heard about MRIs being calibrated wrong and people's hair falling out and getting cancer.
[00:57:43.533 --> 00:57:44.213]  They're so strong.
[00:57:44.253 --> 00:57:49.535]  So it's a serious issue, and that's what these are, are lower intensity MRIs really.
[00:57:50.711 --> 00:57:56.035]  And so they're covering all this up, and it turns out for years, knowing about the cancer clusters.
[00:57:56.956 --> 00:57:59.557]  And finally the TSA are waking up and getting concerned.
[00:57:59.577 --> 00:58:04.501]  The problem is, the smarter ones will just quit, and they'll hire even more crazy goons.
[00:58:07.665 --> 00:58:10.867]  And so they refused to set up the proper radiation monitoring.
[00:58:10.887 --> 00:58:13.608]  Of course, they could be like the EPA now.
[00:58:13.889 --> 00:58:15.049]  When radiation went up in the U.S.
[00:58:15.069 --> 00:58:18.071]  from Fukushima, they just raised the levels of what they say is safe.
[00:58:18.191 --> 00:58:18.771]  More games.
[00:58:19.332 --> 00:58:23.774]  The documents indicate how a large number of workers have been falling victim to cancer, strokes, and heart disease.
[00:58:24.094 --> 00:58:29.938]  The department, rather than acting on it or explaining its position, seems to have just dismissed it.
[00:58:31.047 --> 00:58:33.208]  And it just goes on as it breaks down.
[00:58:33.428 --> 00:58:35.049]  This article is so huge.
[00:58:35.609 --> 00:58:39.111]  We'll get more into the chemical assault on humanity when we get back.
[00:58:39.131 --> 00:58:47.695]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:54.258 --> 00:58:55.179]  Tyranny is here.
[00:58:55.519 --> 00:58:59.040]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:58:59.401 --> 00:59:01.662]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:59:01.862 --> 00:59:07.125]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:59:07.545 --> 00:59:13.848]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:59:14.228 --> 00:59:19.771]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:59:20.211 --> 00:59:23.893]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:59:24.373 --> 00:59:28.336]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:59:28.657 --> 00:59:34.181]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:59:34.601 --> 00:59:37.543]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:59:38.164 --> 00:59:39.565]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:59:40.125 --> 00:59:40.646]  It's here.

[00:59:53.007 --> 00:59:54.947]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.408 --> 00:59:58.268]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:04.809 --> 01:00:05.470]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.130 --> 01:00:07.190]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:07.890 --> 01:00:09.070]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.650 --> 01:00:10.471]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.251 --> 01:00:13.151]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.171 --> 01:00:16.732]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.972 --> 01:00:21.053]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:31.550 --> 01:00:35.714]  We are now into hour number two.
[01:00:37.055 --> 01:00:42.921]  And if you just joined us, we have Congressman Ron Paul scheduled to be joining us in the middle of the next hour.
[01:00:43.521 --> 01:00:47.665]  We have Colonel Craig Roberts joining us coming up in 30 minutes.
[01:00:48.706 --> 01:00:54.492]  We'll go over a host of important news and information and get his perspective on things.
[01:00:56.513 --> 01:00:58.594]  But this is just such incredible news.
[01:00:59.174 --> 01:01:03.356]  Speaking of radiation, cancer surges in body scanner operators.
[01:01:03.896 --> 01:01:05.757]  TSA launches cover-up.
[01:01:05.797 --> 01:01:11.900]  The Union, according to Watson's article, and he's got links to some others, reports that they've had big increases in cancer.
[01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:15.821]  One of the first airports many years ago to test the scanners out.
[01:01:15.861 --> 01:01:17.202]  They are charging.
[01:01:17.222 --> 01:01:18.122]  There's been a cover-up.
[01:01:18.583 --> 01:01:21.424]  Also, coming to a store near you, Radioactive Fish.
[01:01:21.464 --> 01:01:23.065]  That's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:01:24.265 --> 01:01:32.693]  Also, they're reporting all over the news that Fukushima is continuing to dump massive amounts of radiation into the Pacific Ocean.
[01:01:33.473 --> 01:01:42.781]  And it's now been confirmed that part of the nuclear power plant has been flooded here in the United States, in Nebraska.
[01:01:43.956 --> 01:01:48.477]  And there's a headline, what the Fukushima is going on in Omaha.
[01:01:48.517 --> 01:01:50.317]  That's from local talk news.
[01:01:51.698 --> 01:01:55.638]  And the history of government cover-ups, we don't know what the truth is.
[01:01:56.338 --> 01:02:05.420]  We know that there was a disaster right around a few days after Fukushima started, months and months ago, up in an area of Canada.
[01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:09.161]  And they released a bunch of radioactive waste into the lake and said, don't worry about it.
[01:02:10.041 --> 01:02:15.207]  Uh, and radiation levels have gone up, and the media has been told by the government, hey, we're just raising what we say is safe.
[01:02:16.708 --> 01:02:28.280]  You know being shot in the head with a .357 Magnum would probably kill you, at least hurt you, but if the government just said, hey, .357 Magnum rounds fired into your head at point-blank range no longer hurt you, would that suspend the laws of physics and nature?
[01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:29.982]  No, they wouldn't do that.
[01:02:31.462 --> 01:02:35.705]  Now, I meant to come into the show today and get into this incredible report.
[01:02:36.086 --> 01:02:47.595]  And again, there are thousands of studies all over the world, going back 80, 90 years, dealing with plastics, and that they are oils.
[01:02:48.235 --> 01:02:55.061]  They're oil-based, and many of the drugs that Big Pharma has made are petrochemical-based, because they can manipulate it.
[01:02:56.230 --> 01:03:05.358]  And that the bisphenol A that's been adopted in most plastics, the liners of tin cans, plastic juice boxes, you know, all of it, even the paper ones have that lining.
[01:03:05.398 --> 01:03:07.780]  It's how the paper doesn't, you know, doesn't get soggy.
[01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:09.401]  It doesn't break through.
[01:03:10.262 --> 01:03:15.927]  Normal paper box would, that it leaches estrogen mimickers.
[01:03:17.988 --> 01:03:21.693]  And it also causes endocrine disruptions, overall disruptions.
[01:03:22.414 --> 01:03:24.217]  And we covered that report.
[01:03:24.777 --> 01:03:27.341]  And of course, literally hundreds of these.
[01:03:27.381 --> 01:03:33.609]  If you just type in, hermaphrodite frogs, hermaphrodite fish, sterile fish, sterile frogs.
[01:03:33.829 --> 01:03:35.652]  I've seen studies with upwards of half.
[01:03:36.916 --> 01:03:40.920]  of them in the southern Mississippi now being sterile or having both sexes.
[01:03:42.021 --> 01:03:44.163]  And it's also changing the brains of the frogs.
[01:03:44.223 --> 01:03:47.526]  Now, the globalists would spin this as a human right.
[01:03:47.646 --> 01:03:52.851]  The frogs have a right for us to dump us in the water and make them hermaphrodites, or make them confused.
[01:03:52.871 --> 01:03:57.816]  See, it's a scientific issue, but they would say, you're being a hermaphrodite frog-a-phobe.
[01:03:58.556 --> 01:04:01.260]  I'm like, what does this have to do with people's sexual preference?
[01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:05.585]  I'm saying they're choosing it for you, and that it's not like a preference.
[01:04:05.705 --> 01:04:09.671]  They have biologically altered who you are, and that's been the plan all along.
[01:04:11.348 --> 01:04:17.270]  We cover it in the Endgame Extras, the university documents where they talked about doing this, and now we got Holdren and all the others.
[01:04:17.290 --> 01:04:18.430]  This is what they've done.
[01:04:19.230 --> 01:04:22.911]  And they're keeping it in the plastics, they're keeping it in everything, they're doing it and they don't care.
[01:04:22.931 --> 01:04:24.212]  And they're not going to stop.
[01:04:25.272 --> 01:04:27.373]  You have to stop eating and drinking out of what they're doing.
[01:04:27.393 --> 01:04:28.673]  And then you've got the GMO crops.
[01:04:28.853 --> 01:04:35.115]  Every major GMO crop, in every major even internal study, has the quote side effect, it's the real effect.
[01:04:36.493 --> 01:04:53.550]  It's the perfect place to hide it in that genome that's so complex that only the genetic engineers who were inducted into this Malthusian eugenic school at the major universities, and then if they buy into it, they get the grants, they get the jobs, they then know what they're doing.
[01:04:53.570 --> 01:04:58.035]  Of course, they're all obsessed with organic food, because they know what they're doing to everybody else.
[01:04:58.235 --> 01:04:58.776]  It's a cult.
[01:05:01.175 --> 01:05:02.676]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:02.896 --> 01:05:07.919]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:05:08.199 --> 01:05:09.560]  Saving means to make money.
[01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:18.505]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:05:19.245 --> 01:05:26.352]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:05:26.792 --> 01:05:34.399]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:39.724]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:05:40.024 --> 01:05:42.186]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[01:05:59.633 --> 01:06:03.876]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:06:04.196 --> 01:06:04.797]  Number 1.
[01:06:05.097 --> 01:06:08.259]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:09.080]  Number 2.
[01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:13.944]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:06:14.284 --> 01:06:14.724]  It's true.
[01:06:15.024 --> 01:06:19.588]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:06:19.908 --> 01:06:20.448]  Number 3.
[01:06:20.729 --> 01:06:24.011]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:06:24.311 --> 01:06:28.014]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:06:28.214 --> 01:06:28.755]  Number 4.
[01:06:29.015 --> 01:06:31.377]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:06:31.777 --> 01:06:35.161]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:06:35.461 --> 01:06:35.661]  Number 5.
[01:06:36.242 --> 01:06:40.165]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:06:40.385 --> 01:06:45.150]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:07:09.845 --> 01:07:13.929]  They haven't increased their prices on great long-term food reserves since last year.
[01:07:14.309 --> 01:07:19.495]  With the rising cost of raw materials and gas prices, they can't hold off any longer.
[01:07:20.155 --> 01:07:28.139]  As of July 1st, Ifu's Direct is forced to increase their prices so they can still ship you the best storable food on the planet.
[01:07:28.479 --> 01:07:33.941]  Until the end of June, you can lock in the cost of your food at last year's prices by calling 800-409-5633.

[01:08:01.137 --> 01:08:03.379]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:03.899 --> 01:08:06.701]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:10.362 --> 01:08:26.589]  I want to commend everyone that marched into the Capitol for the second time in a month yesterday in Texas to try to ensure that a true bill to defend the Fourth Amendment, to defend the Tenth Amendment, to defend our dignity of our women and children would be passed.
[01:08:27.829 --> 01:08:29.670]  And they got it at seven ways this Sunday.
[01:08:29.690 --> 01:08:30.710]  I'm going to be breaking that down.
[01:08:30.750 --> 01:08:31.971]  But resistance is victory.
[01:08:33.351 --> 01:08:34.952]  We've been talking to the reporters on the ground.
[01:08:34.992 --> 01:08:38.513]  It looks like now even the Senate and House version won't be able to be merged.
[01:08:38.973 --> 01:08:40.134]  So it'll probably die.
[01:08:40.194 --> 01:08:44.735]  But if it goes into special session, we've got to continue to analyze this bill and probably try to kill it.
[01:08:46.396 --> 01:08:49.357]  But we're going to break that down, if not today, tomorrow.
[01:08:51.551 --> 01:08:52.372]  And I haven't decided yet.
[01:08:52.392 --> 01:08:53.693]  I'm gonna go back down there today.
[01:08:54.413 --> 01:08:56.135]  So much is coming in fast and furious.
[01:08:57.576 --> 01:09:02.820]  If you just joined us, breaking cancer surges in body scanner operations.
[01:09:03.461 --> 01:09:11.207]  TSA launches cover-up and television in DC is reporting on this and the head of Epic
[01:09:12.430 --> 01:09:31.243]  The Electronic Privacy Information Center, great folks, Mark Rottenberg, we've interviewed him, they've talked to the unions and others, and it's been going on for years there at Boston and other airports where the TSA has been testing since late 2002, the scanners, huge cancer clusters.
[01:09:32.487 --> 01:09:37.172]  And they use all the other private studies and even university studies have said it's deadly.
[01:09:37.552 --> 01:09:42.317]  They've misrepresented John Hopkins and the head of the study went public last year and said my study said it'll cause cancer.
[01:09:42.897 --> 01:09:45.420]  You misrepresented in the news saying I was for this.
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:46.601]  It's the same thing with
[01:09:48.118 --> 01:09:48.498]  NIST.
[01:09:49.099 --> 01:09:55.703]  NIST will... Well, NIST has changed its story on Building 7 falling at freefall and how it fell five times now.
[01:09:55.723 --> 01:09:58.505]  Now they say they don't know why Building 7 fell on 9-11.
[01:09:58.905 --> 01:10:02.528]  So it's a very disreputable, corrupt, government-funded agency.
[01:10:02.548 --> 01:10:03.348]  I mean, what do you expect?
[01:10:06.306 --> 01:10:12.930]  NIST has agreed with the UN that the sun doesn't affect climate, and they're backing carbon taxes with fake science.
[01:10:13.351 --> 01:10:15.532]  Of course, the sun drives climate, it's the main driver.
[01:10:15.912 --> 01:10:19.655]  Anyone who says otherwise is completely insane, according to all the top meteorologists we've interviewed.
[01:10:19.675 --> 01:10:23.918]  But your common sense, ladies and gentlemen, knows that it affects and drives the climate.
[01:10:24.338 --> 01:10:28.081]  We would be absolute zero in a matter of days if the sun disappeared.
[01:10:28.141 --> 01:10:29.742]  I mean, it's just asinine.
[01:10:30.422 --> 01:10:39.188]  And the sun's fluctuations, like the heat on a fire when you're frying eggs, when the sun fluctuates up and down and the heat it's putting off.
[01:10:39.888 --> 01:10:41.329]  I can't believe I'm even having to explain this.
[01:10:41.389 --> 01:10:42.330]  You know that, OK?
[01:10:42.990 --> 01:10:46.393]  So they put out this report that they wouldn't give Congress last year.
[01:10:46.793 --> 01:10:47.513]  Finally, it's come.
[01:10:47.534 --> 01:10:48.594]  They wouldn't give Congress this.
[01:10:48.934 --> 01:10:50.215]  The numbers are blacked out.
[01:10:50.996 --> 01:10:53.337]  They're saying, yeah, there's some radiation leaking out of these.
[01:10:54.938 --> 01:10:57.080]  But we say it's healthy for you.
[01:10:57.100 --> 01:10:59.922]  But then they black out what the radiation level is.
[01:11:01.803 --> 01:11:03.705]  And so it is on.
[01:11:04.385 --> 01:11:10.430]  The fact that they've covered up the cancer clusters, and this report is up at Infowars.com, this could break their back.
[01:11:11.011 --> 01:11:23.600]  The fact that it's not just travelers going through the porno scans that store an image of your body, or that they're frisking you with dirty gloves that they don't change but every hundred or so searches, that it violates the Fourth Amendment, trains kids to be molested.
[01:11:24.301 --> 01:11:29.628]  That's the equivalent of walking down a dark alley, you know, in the worst area in New York or Chicago or Houston every time you go to the airport.
[01:11:29.648 --> 01:11:31.029]  You don't know what's going to happen to you.
[01:11:31.250 --> 01:11:34.213]  Untrained people on power trips, told to do this stuff.
[01:11:34.674 --> 01:11:40.601]  They themselves, victims of their own tyranny, they're being roasted by the machines, as I've kept explaining.
[01:11:40.621 --> 01:11:41.402]  We've had the...
[01:11:43.134 --> 01:11:44.195]  We're going to get more on it as well.
[01:11:44.235 --> 01:11:46.096]  The scientists, we've interviewed the radiologists.
[01:11:46.417 --> 01:11:47.898]  But, I mean, again, my dad's a dentist.
[01:11:48.618 --> 01:11:51.921]  They have a radiation officer who wears a badge.
[01:11:51.941 --> 01:11:53.422]  They're checking it monthly.
[01:11:53.502 --> 01:11:56.705]  Companies have to come in and calibrate it and check it and do readings.
[01:11:58.884 --> 01:12:02.107]  But the federal government just says, we're exempt from our own laws.
[01:12:03.148 --> 01:12:04.790]  They don't even have a regulation that does that.
[01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:06.291]  And they don't want to give Congress the numbers.
[01:12:06.391 --> 01:12:11.736]  So, here is a TV newscast dealing with it.
[01:12:11.757 --> 01:12:17.942]  In fact, if you'll just put the video paused up there on screen, I can give folks the call letters of the TV station.
[01:12:17.962 --> 01:12:18.243]  Thank you.
[01:12:18.263 --> 01:12:19.424]  In fact, I even have the printout here.
[01:12:22.418 --> 01:12:23.819]  Yes, WUSA 9.
[01:12:24.519 --> 01:12:27.060]  And I've got those reports printed.
[01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:28.401]  I just can't find them in my stack.
[01:12:29.401 --> 01:12:36.645]  But we'll go ahead and play that news clip here as a public service warning, especially to the TSA people.
[01:12:36.925 --> 01:12:37.245]  Here it is.
[01:12:39.710 --> 01:12:45.074]  There are new questions this evening about the safety of those body scanners being used at the nation's airport.
[01:12:45.114 --> 01:12:50.738]  Yeah, questions like, do they expose TSA workers and passengers to unsafe levels of radiation?
[01:12:51.038 --> 01:12:55.722]  In tonight's top story, Gary Nuremberg is here with what is now an uncertain answer.
[01:12:55.742 --> 01:12:56.082]  Gary?
[01:12:56.162 --> 01:13:05.229]  Well, uncertain, Derek, because some prominent scientists say there just isn't enough data, hasn't been enough testing to demonstrably prove the machines are safe.
[01:13:06.445 --> 01:13:12.573]  The government says the scanners are safe, but documents secured by the Freedom of Information Act have raised questions.
[01:13:12.773 --> 01:13:21.284]  We think that the Department of Homeland Security has not been forthcoming with the public about the true extent of radiation risk with the airport body scanners.
[01:13:21.364 --> 01:13:24.749]  He points to a National Institute of Standards and Technology memo.
[01:13:25.049 --> 01:13:29.957]  Saying that the Department of Homeland Security had overstated that agency's support for the program.
[01:13:30.237 --> 01:13:36.968]  The union representing TSA workers wants dosimeters to measure the radiation workers are exposed to, but that has been denied.
[01:13:37.629 --> 01:13:42.274]  In Boston, a union memo cites a growing number of workers diagnosed with cancer.
[01:13:42.494 --> 01:13:47.840]  We certainly feel that the program should be suspended pending an independent investigation.
[01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:58.671]  In a letter to the president's science advisor, university professors agreed, saying safety tests of the machines were performed by the manufacturer and questioned the science of the safety studies.
[01:13:59.211 --> 01:14:08.877]  They conclude important information has not been provided to the public, saying there is still no rigorous hard data for the safety of x-ray airport scanners.
[01:14:09.357 --> 01:14:13.739]  Dr. John Sadat telling 9 News Now, we do not know what the dose is.
[01:14:14.099 --> 01:14:16.581]  The dose can be a lot higher than they say it is.
[01:14:17.041 --> 01:14:20.223]  If you go through, you're taking your chances, he says.
[01:14:20.979 --> 01:14:33.144]  TSA issued a statement saying it has implemented stringent safety protocols to ensure that technology used at airports to screen people and property is safe for all passengers as well as the TSA workforce.
[01:14:33.785 --> 01:14:42.208]  Each individual machine that uses x-ray technology is regularly tested to ensure the radiation emitted falls within the national safety limits.
[01:14:42.248 --> 01:14:43.449]  They got caught lying last year about that.
[01:14:43.789 --> 01:14:55.982]  Despite those assurances, those scientists in Rothenburg from the Electronic Privacy Information Center want independent tests of the machine outside Homeland Security, and they want a moratorium on their use until those tests are conclusive.
[01:14:56.442 --> 01:14:57.744]  Now, what machines are we talking about?
[01:14:57.864 --> 01:15:04.751]  In general, if the scanner revolves around you, or if you're told to raise your arms to be scanned, that's the technology at issue.
[01:15:05.132 --> 01:15:05.352]  Anita?
[01:15:07.017 --> 01:15:11.979]  And then he's got more links to other articles with the union concerned about this and the cancer cluster.
[01:15:12.379 --> 01:15:17.421]  So that article is up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:15:17.461 --> 01:15:19.702]  Cancer Surges and Body Scanner Operators.
[01:15:20.082 --> 01:15:21.963]  TSA launches cover-up.
[01:15:22.837 --> 01:15:24.698]  And I'm not blaming even that local news.
[01:15:25.378 --> 01:15:27.199]  They did a good job.
[01:15:28.119 --> 01:15:32.421]  Most people don't study every facet, every angle of an issue.
[01:15:32.881 --> 01:15:38.123]  But last year and this year, in fact I'm going to get Paul to write another article or get Steve or Aaron or Kurt to do it.
[01:15:39.113 --> 01:15:52.316]  I know we wrote articles about it, where Congress asked for it, they said, we've studied it, they just gave them a boil-down, then it turned out they hadn't tested the machines, aren't following federal and state law for radiology testing of the equipment, and that there was a cover-up.
[01:15:52.416 --> 01:16:01.578]  So, then to have TSA tell the news, we tested, it's rigorous, it's there, they won't even give Congress this information because it turns out they're not doing it.
[01:16:02.138 --> 01:16:05.619]  Because criminals don't want a paper trail of what they've done.
[01:16:05.639 --> 01:16:08.140]  They could care less what happens.
[01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:10.100]  Hey Rob, how you doing?
[01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:10.561]  What's going on?
[01:16:12.101 --> 01:16:12.522]  Come on in.
[01:16:13.222 --> 01:16:13.742]  What's going on?
[01:16:18.304 --> 01:16:18.584]  Okay.
[01:16:20.886 --> 01:16:21.746]  Oh, thank you, yeah.
[01:16:21.946 --> 01:16:23.747]  Okay, thank you so much for that information.
[01:16:26.048 --> 01:16:28.709]  Yeah, this is a different memo than what he linked to, yeah.
[01:16:29.230 --> 01:16:30.530]  Good, we're getting more documents in here.
[01:16:30.570 --> 01:16:31.270]  Thank you so much.
[01:16:32.131 --> 01:16:36.133]  Okay, now continuing here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:16:38.729 --> 01:16:44.270]  I haven't even gotten into the Financial Times of London that is the globalist mouthpiece that openly calls for world government.
[01:16:44.510 --> 01:16:53.572]  Their foreign editors wrote an article called Now for World Government saying, yes, it's stealth, yes, it's authoritarian, it's for your own good, you conspiracy scum, you know, basically.
[01:16:54.352 --> 01:17:02.314]  They've had a new one out, a dollar scene losing global reserve status, and they talk about basically the end of the United States because all we've got left is the dollar.
[01:17:02.494 --> 01:17:05.515]  It's being devalued, but when we lose it, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:17:06.355 --> 01:17:20.007]  All Hades is going to break loose, and you've got on average a nation of drugged out, bisphenol-A weirdos who don't want to tie their shoelaces.
[01:17:20.047 --> 01:17:23.590]  It's not that they can't tie their shoelaces, they've been chemically lobotomized.
[01:17:23.630 --> 01:17:26.773]  They've been victimized to the point they can't even operate.
[01:17:27.193 --> 01:17:28.094]  And again, here is
[01:17:29.577 --> 01:17:30.697]  The French News Agency.
[01:17:31.098 --> 01:17:36.519]  Chemicals in plastic containers make mice, make male mice act like females.
[01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:39.720]  And there's all the other studies about the reduced fertility.
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:41.961]  This has been done also in humans.
[01:17:43.402 --> 01:17:45.162]  That's why areas of Europe have banned it.
[01:17:46.503 --> 01:17:47.703]  But it's a little too late.
[01:17:47.723 --> 01:17:50.384]  Because now it's basically in everything.
[01:17:51.358 --> 01:17:56.603]  It goes on, but what they don't cover in this study is what the other studies show of the breast cancer in women.
[01:17:57.344 --> 01:18:07.915]  And I warned you about this over and over again, so we're going to pull up the next video here, where I got demonized by all the big media madness type outfits, that I was being homophobic.
[01:18:09.616 --> 01:18:11.338]  Let's get all that aside, okay?
[01:18:12.359 --> 01:18:14.802]  You understand, if I talk about mice becoming feminine,
[01:18:15.826 --> 01:18:28.530]  And in the studies that are out there, the same with the fish, dogs, they've done it, they begin to want to be mounted by males, because it affects the area of the brain.
[01:18:29.130 --> 01:18:39.494]  I mean, if this stuff's so strong in fish that it's making them have both sexual organs, or lizards, or snakes, or amphibians like frogs and toads, and I read those articles earlier,
[01:18:40.154 --> 01:18:42.196]  What do you think it's doing to humans?
[01:18:42.216 --> 01:18:44.818]  You know, the point is, this is going on and you should know about it.
[01:18:45.079 --> 01:18:50.043]  So instead of the George Soros outfits, they come out and attack us saying we're bashing gay people.
[01:18:50.083 --> 01:18:51.304]  It has nothing to do with that.
[01:18:52.586 --> 01:19:00.072]  I mean, if I'm talking about mice being turned into basically females, males, am I now homophobic against gay mice?
[01:19:00.273 --> 01:19:02.735]  It's chemicals being done to us.
[01:19:02.995 --> 01:19:03.696]  Be adults.
[01:19:06.135 --> 01:19:15.913]  We'll come back from break and play, you know, the clip that they edited together and took out of context where I was talking about juice boxes and how it has bisphenol A in it.
[01:19:17.897 --> 01:19:28.706]  But let's just say it's a gift from the globalist to make men become sterile, or reduce fertility, and to develop the area of their brain.
[01:19:28.726 --> 01:19:31.709]  You're feeding the brain female hormones, they begin to become attracted to males.
[01:19:32.229 --> 01:19:40.636]  Because the olfactory nerve smells, and that's what happened with the mice in the studies, the females don't want these mice.
[01:19:41.477 --> 01:19:45.940]  But other males that haven't been given it, they then want the male mice that have been given it.
[01:19:46.741 --> 01:19:50.544]  So, your olfactory nerve picks up the pheromone.
[01:19:50.564 --> 01:19:52.205]  That's why your underarms stink.
[01:19:52.305 --> 01:19:55.707]  That's your must for the brain to pick up.
[01:19:56.148 --> 01:19:57.589]  It's how mammals operate.
[01:19:58.129 --> 01:19:59.110]  I'll explain it when we come back.
[01:19:59.949 --> 01:20:02.571]  Since 2007, the Federal Reserve and the U.S.
[01:20:02.631 --> 01:20:06.954]  government have injected as much as $20 trillion into the economies of the world.
[01:20:07.154 --> 01:20:09.916]  And yet the globe's economies continue to contract.
[01:20:10.196 --> 01:20:13.319]  Our government is borrowing $58,000 per second.
[01:20:13.479 --> 01:20:15.981]  If they stop spending, the economy collapses.
[01:20:16.201 --> 01:20:18.803]  If they continue spending, the economy collapses.
[01:20:19.083 --> 01:20:22.245]  And if they raise interest rates, the economy collapses.
[01:20:22.365 --> 01:20:22.946]  Prepare now!

[01:22:03.530 --> 01:22:06.351]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[01:22:06.851 --> 01:22:11.572]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:22:11.952 --> 01:22:16.175]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:22:16.475 --> 01:22:18.837]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:22:18.937 --> 01:22:21.358]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:22:21.699 --> 01:22:24.260]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:22:24.601 --> 01:22:32.206]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:22:32.546 --> 01:22:37.828]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:22:37.928 --> 01:22:40.728]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:22:40.788 --> 01:22:44.209]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:22:44.469 --> 01:22:45.390]  And I got news for you.
[01:22:45.550 --> 01:22:46.850]  You're everyone else.
[01:22:46.870 --> 01:22:47.870]  Invisible Empire.

[01:24:13.308 --> 01:24:18.491]  But your thoughts will soon be wandering the way they always do.
[01:24:44.752 --> 01:24:45.835]  Alright!
[01:24:46.939 --> 01:24:48.725]  Let's go ahead and get back to the hardcore news.
[01:24:49.588 --> 01:24:50.752]  Now, remember...
[01:24:51.934 --> 01:25:10.903]  Almost all, just type it in, most receipts in the U.S., most printer cartridges are pure bisphenol A. The toner medium, the color is something else, but the liquid is liquid plastic, bisphenol A, just touching a few receipts lowers fertility.
[01:25:11.363 --> 01:25:14.004]  I'm so weak-minded that I still use a cell phone.
[01:25:14.024 --> 01:25:17.546]  The point is they just put it in our environment knowing we're designed to live in our environment.
[01:25:18.300 --> 01:25:20.842]  I still use a cell phone, admitted massive brain tumors.
[01:25:21.282 --> 01:25:25.145]  Again, even as much as I know, they have made this our environment.
[01:25:25.906 --> 01:25:41.537]  Where I always catch myself, somebody gives me a tin can of water or whatever, you know, flavored water, and I go, oh my gosh, and I cut the can open, it's plastic-lined bisphenol A, I look on the bottom, bisphenol A. So I'm like super, you know, male, high testosterone, but it's a lot lower than it would be.
[01:25:42.058 --> 01:25:42.598]  So I'm weak.
[01:25:43.058 --> 01:25:46.121]  Now, a male that wouldn't be dominant is extremely feminine.
[01:25:46.821 --> 01:25:53.584]  That's why the male genitals, across the western world, anywhere Bisphenol A is using, generation after generation are getting smaller.
[01:25:53.864 --> 01:25:55.144]  You don't even have testosterone.
[01:25:55.324 --> 01:25:59.026]  It's why cops now, even police chiefs, are saying, openly take testosterone.
[01:25:59.366 --> 01:26:00.927]  Because they're not males anymore.
[01:26:01.187 --> 01:26:02.567]  They have to take steroids.
[01:26:02.627 --> 01:26:11.511]  I may reverse myself on steroids, something I've always been against from research, but if we don't have them, it's almost like Cushing's Syndrome, we need the steroids now.
[01:26:12.503 --> 01:26:15.485]  I mean, this is hard core, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:26:15.825 --> 01:26:22.909]  But remember, the media is going to spin this and go, Alex says juice boxes make you gay, like they did last year, when I was reading Mainline Studies then.
[01:26:23.689 --> 01:26:26.090]  But never telling you I'm reading a study, they cut that out.
[01:26:26.130 --> 01:26:28.011]  They'll cut this out as well, the Soros people will.
[01:26:30.143 --> 01:26:35.687]  But it won't matter, because then people in the comments of the articles go, well, wait, he's talking about Bisphenol A. Why is this all cut up?
[01:26:36.167 --> 01:26:41.290]  Again, they know and don't want you to know, because they're population exterminists.
[01:26:41.711 --> 01:26:49.096]  Now, let's play one of the edited clips of many online, but it's still clear what I'm saying about Bisphenol A with Bob Chapman a year and a half ago.
[01:26:49.116 --> 01:26:49.376]  Here it is.
[01:26:49.735 --> 01:26:53.358]  But the reason there's so many gay people now is because it's a chemical warfare operation.
[01:26:53.398 --> 01:26:58.763]  I have the government documents where they said they're going to encourage homosexuality with chemicals so that people don't have children.
[01:26:59.804 --> 01:27:03.488]  I even catch myself, Bob, drinking out of these estrogen mimickers.
[01:27:03.888 --> 01:27:07.391]  They'll probably say it if it's lined with it inside the plastic packaging.
[01:27:07.772 --> 01:27:11.475]  Oh, I wonder if this spring water, natural lime flavor I'm drinking.
[01:27:11.755 --> 01:27:14.177]  I know full well HEB's putting fluoride in this.
[01:27:14.438 --> 01:27:15.399]  Why am I drinking this?
[01:27:16.019 --> 01:27:22.985]  I know full well these kettle chips say that they don't have MSG, but they've got the yeast extract thing that says it's MSG.
[01:27:23.185 --> 01:27:23.966]  What's wrong with us?
[01:27:24.006 --> 01:27:24.846]  Why won't we stop?
[01:27:25.026 --> 01:27:25.967]  Why am I so weak?
[01:27:28.889 --> 01:27:31.592]  And they know that they have immersed us in this, Bob.
[01:27:31.612 --> 01:27:36.516]  For those watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, here's the inside of this juice box.
[01:27:37.296 --> 01:27:39.698]  And if they zoom in any more, see that thin plastic?
[01:27:39.898 --> 01:27:40.379]  It's got it.
[01:27:41.780 --> 01:27:43.902]  And I'm letting my children drink this.
[01:27:44.997 --> 01:27:50.807]  Because after you're done drinking your little juices, you're ready to go out and have a baby!
[01:27:51.809 --> 01:27:53.011]  You're ready to put makeup on!
[01:27:53.031 --> 01:27:54.353]  You're ready to wear a short skirt!
[01:27:54.814 --> 01:27:56.436]  You're ready to go, uh, you know, uh...
[01:27:57.506 --> 01:27:59.849]  Put together a, you know, a garden of roses or something.
[01:27:59.889 --> 01:28:00.629]  I'll stop right there.
[01:28:00.649 --> 01:28:01.811]  You're ready to put lipstick on.
[01:28:01.991 --> 01:28:06.316]  That now, now again, before, all over the world, puberty was 13 to 14 in girls.
[01:28:06.756 --> 01:28:09.199]  Now in the West, it's 10 on average.
[01:28:09.839 --> 01:28:14.304]  As young as 3, don't believe me, just type it in, mainstream news, 3 year olds going into puberty.
[01:28:14.945 --> 01:28:17.288]  Hundreds of thousands in the U.S., 5 year olds.
[01:28:18.766 --> 01:28:23.188]  So again, the media spins this like he's attacking our wonderful gayness.
[01:28:23.268 --> 01:28:24.248]  Everyone's turning gay.
[01:28:24.308 --> 01:28:24.869]  It's wonderful.
[01:28:25.149 --> 01:28:26.770]  I'm not making a judgment about that.
[01:28:27.190 --> 01:28:28.490]  That's how mind-controlled you are.
[01:28:28.830 --> 01:28:30.291]  It's under chemical attack.
[01:28:30.351 --> 01:28:33.132]  They're changing who we are so we don't have children.
[01:28:33.933 --> 01:28:36.254]  I'm not getting caught up in your distraction.
[01:28:36.274 --> 01:28:43.757]  I mean, if they put a microchip in our head to make us automaton drones, you know, would they say, don't discriminate against drones?
[01:28:44.257 --> 01:28:45.598]  It was artificially done.
[01:28:47.011 --> 01:28:48.392]  That's why there's the explosion.
[01:28:48.632 --> 01:28:50.674]  But let's get all the gay stuff out of it.
[01:28:51.294 --> 01:28:52.935]  Why are little girls going into puberty?
[01:28:52.975 --> 01:29:00.400]  Well, next it'll be, you're against discriminating against the five-year-old girls that want to dress like hookers and are running around, you know, going into puberty early.
[01:29:01.221 --> 01:29:14.310]  People wonder why they see, like, ten-year-olds with breasts and all this crazy sexual promiscuity, because the boys have been feminized, the girls have been hyper-feminized, and all of their organs
[01:29:14.850 --> 01:29:17.412]  Because that's what causes cancer is the hormone flux.
[01:29:17.733 --> 01:29:19.334]  That's why, again, sharks don't get cancer.
[01:29:19.634 --> 01:29:20.355]  They don't have hormones.
[01:29:20.375 --> 01:29:21.416]  They have a different system.
[01:29:22.577 --> 01:29:24.459]  That's why women get breast cancer.
[01:29:24.479 --> 01:29:25.560]  It's one of the biggest reasons.
[01:29:26.140 --> 01:29:26.961]  And they know this.
[01:29:26.981 --> 01:29:28.242]  They're murdering you.
[01:29:28.743 --> 01:29:29.664]  But again, you don't want to hear that.
[01:29:29.684 --> 01:29:34.248]  You want to go have a jog for breast cancer and give it to the Cancer Society that then helps cover all this up.
[01:29:35.475 --> 01:29:35.915]  They know.
[01:29:35.935 --> 01:29:37.457]  And of course, here's the other articles.
[01:29:37.517 --> 01:29:39.518]  Diabetes doubling the last 10 years.
[01:29:40.019 --> 01:29:41.020]  MSNBC.
[01:29:43.162 --> 01:29:44.122]  Scientific American.
[01:29:44.142 --> 01:29:45.263]  They're murdering us.
[01:29:45.303 --> 01:29:46.344]  They're murdering us.
[01:29:46.565 --> 01:29:47.545]  They're murdering us.
[01:29:47.585 --> 01:29:48.546]  They're murdering us.
[01:29:48.586 --> 01:29:49.387]  They're murdering us.
[01:29:49.427 --> 01:29:50.208]  They're murdering us.
[01:29:50.448 --> 01:29:51.349]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.829 --> 01:29:53.430]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.450 --> 01:29:57.053]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.991 --> 01:30:05.614]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:05.954 --> 01:30:14.081]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:30:14.821 --> 01:30:18.844]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:30:19.445 --> 01:30:30.274]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:30:30.894 --> 01:30:39.897]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:40.397 --> 01:30:45.439]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:30:45.839 --> 01:30:53.002]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:53.322 --> 01:30:56.083]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[01:31:01.255 --> 01:31:04.876]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:31:05.276 --> 01:31:08.277]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:31:08.517 --> 01:31:13.278]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:31:13.298 --> 01:31:19.560]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:31:19.700 --> 01:31:21.921]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:31:22.481 --> 01:31:22.761]  Tim Geithner?
[01:31:22.781 --> 01:31:23.202]  Bernanke?
[01:31:23.302 --> 01:31:23.903]  They're arsonists!
[01:31:23.963 --> 01:31:25.224]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:31:25.244 --> 01:31:27.487]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:31:41.383 --> 01:31:48.311]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:31:48.672 --> 01:31:57.783]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:31:59.755 --> 01:32:03.998]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:32:04.318 --> 01:32:04.918]  Number 1.
[01:32:05.219 --> 01:32:08.381]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:08.641 --> 01:32:09.201]  Number 2.
[01:32:09.502 --> 01:32:14.045]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:14.405 --> 01:32:14.845]  It's true.
[01:32:15.145 --> 01:32:19.708]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:20.009 --> 01:32:20.549]  Number 3.
[01:32:20.849 --> 01:32:24.131]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:24.431 --> 01:32:28.134]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:28.334 --> 01:32:28.874]  Number 4.
[01:32:29.115 --> 01:32:31.496]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:31.877 --> 01:32:35.259]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:32:35.559 --> 01:32:35.779]  Number 5.
[01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:40.282]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:32:40.503 --> 01:32:45.266]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:32:45.546 --> 01:32:49.572]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:49.732 --> 01:32:51.274]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:51.515 --> 01:32:53.598]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[01:33:41.102 --> 01:33:42.903]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:33:42.923 --> 01:33:44.525]  until 2 p.m.
[01:33:44.785 --> 01:33:45.866]  Central Standard Time.
[01:33:45.906 --> 01:33:48.208]  We're here live back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:33:48.709 --> 01:33:56.255]  For the next hour, it's gonna be my pleasure and your pleasure, I hope, to hear from a really great patriot, an amazing guy, Colonel Craig Roberts.
[01:33:57.377 --> 01:33:59.238]  We're gonna introduce him here in a moment.
[01:34:00.419 --> 01:34:01.801]  A artificial
[01:34:03.706 --> 01:34:06.248]  Habitat has been built for humanity.
[01:34:06.308 --> 01:34:12.412]  That's what this technocratic new world order, planned society, end of the family, end of the sexes is.
[01:34:12.432 --> 01:34:23.360]  I mean, I've got stuff from the UN in 1947 talking about drugging the population to be infertile, creating the ideal hermaphrodite worker drone.
[01:34:23.921 --> 01:34:25.141]  I've made films about it.
[01:34:25.182 --> 01:34:26.062]  You can't make it up.
[01:34:26.142 --> 01:34:32.267]  And now we know that they put bisphenol A and all the major plastics out of hundreds of different
[01:34:33.183 --> 01:34:40.044]  I can't tell you how many wonderful, young, smart women are fighting for their lives and dying right now.
[01:35:02.898 --> 01:35:04.759]  It's just a giant genocide.
[01:35:05.299 --> 01:35:08.961]  And the globalists said Hitler's doing it wrong, marching people in and shooting them.
[01:35:09.541 --> 01:35:11.242]  We're going to do it through soft kill weapons.
[01:35:11.262 --> 01:35:12.743]  We're going to talk to Roberts about that in a moment.
[01:35:12.763 --> 01:35:13.823]  We've got a bunch of other issues.
[01:35:14.283 --> 01:35:17.485]  Operation Fast and Furious, Obama shipping the guns into Mexico.
[01:35:18.846 --> 01:35:21.927]  The globalists putting the Muslim extremists in power all over the Middle East.
[01:35:22.047 --> 01:35:22.788]  What's behind that?
[01:35:23.248 --> 01:35:25.149]  His view on the TSA.
[01:35:25.169 --> 01:35:26.689]  We're just going to pick his brain today.
[01:35:26.709 --> 01:35:29.571]  I could talk to him for 10 hours, but Ron Paul's coming up in about an hour.
[01:35:30.390 --> 01:35:31.491]  Right after Roberts leaves us.
[01:35:31.551 --> 01:35:32.831]  And he's a hard guy to get on the radio.
[01:35:33.491 --> 01:35:34.672]  He's retired.
[01:35:34.732 --> 01:35:35.873]  He's rode over the sunset.
[01:35:35.913 --> 01:35:37.974]  He's hung up his spurs and his guns.
[01:35:38.574 --> 01:35:39.494]  No, he hasn't completely.
[01:35:39.514 --> 01:35:41.315]  He's just busy taking care of his family.
[01:35:41.895 --> 01:35:42.316]  But here it is.
[01:35:42.376 --> 01:35:46.057]  Chemicals in plastic containers makes male mice act like females.
[01:35:46.618 --> 01:35:49.219]  Actually causes them to release female hormones.
[01:35:49.259 --> 01:35:50.540]  The females don't want to breed with them.
[01:35:50.940 --> 01:35:52.561]  Then you get the female disdain of the male.
[01:35:53.021 --> 01:35:53.701]  And that's what's happened.
[01:35:53.761 --> 01:35:54.321]  And it's a fact.
[01:35:54.381 --> 01:35:54.902]  And they know it.
[01:35:54.982 --> 01:35:56.322]  And it's in the printer cartridge.
[01:35:56.602 --> 01:35:58.323]  I know I've been taught to repeat that over and over again.
[01:35:58.804 --> 01:35:59.484]  But it's important.
[01:36:00.546 --> 01:36:09.529]  Now, before we go to Roberts, if you believe in what we're doing, it's your purchase of the books, the videos, the tapes that supports the broadcast, but that's only part of it.
[01:36:10.009 --> 01:36:14.331]  The larger issue is, it gives you tools to further increase your knowledge.
[01:36:15.749 --> 01:36:28.215]  And it also then gives you tools to pay it forward, to have a showing at your house, invite folks over for hamburgers, show them one of my films, put it on AXS TV, air it on your local radio show, clips of it, make copies, hand them out.
[01:36:28.235 --> 01:36:31.396]  There were folks at the Capitol doing that yesterday, fight the TSA, it was beautiful.
[01:36:31.416 --> 01:36:32.817]  I'm gonna cover that more next hour.
[01:36:34.197 --> 01:36:35.218]  All of this was happening.
[01:36:36.872 --> 01:36:38.472]  Well, there's this film I didn't make.
[01:36:38.572 --> 01:36:40.253]  It's only 30-something minutes long.
[01:36:40.333 --> 01:36:49.614]  It's an excellent, modern style for the masses about the Federal Reserve and the banksters and the globalists.
[01:36:49.654 --> 01:36:53.255]  It's called The American Dream, Fighting the Lying Liars One Stupid Lie at a Time.
[01:36:54.335 --> 01:36:55.856]  Available at Infowars.com.
[01:36:56.256 --> 01:36:58.736]  We've got a special we're running till Friday and then it's gone.

[01:37:04.028 --> 01:37:16.037]  Terror Storm, Endgame, Fall of the Republic, and Police State, The Rise of FEMA, which is very key to chronicle the whole globalist takeover through this infrastructure.

[01:37:49.963 --> 01:37:50.263]  Also,

[01:38:02.767 --> 01:38:05.608]  Now, I wanted to get Colonel Roberts on for quite a while, and he's joined us today.
[01:38:15.875 --> 01:38:23.760]  Colonel Craig Roberts landed in Vietnam in July of 1965 as an automatic rifleman with Hotel Company, 2nd Battalion, 9th Marines.
[01:38:24.221 --> 01:38:26.742]  He served with the Tulsa Police Department for 27 years.
[01:38:27.583 --> 01:38:35.068]  In 1985, Roberts transferred to the Army Reserve, 95th Division, and served in various battalion and division assignments, including intelligence.
[01:38:35.468 --> 01:38:39.271]  Roberts returned in 1999 as Lieutenant Colonel, Infantry Air Operations, 11A5U.
[01:38:41.352 --> 01:38:47.433]  His last 12 years were working as a ground liaison officer in the intelligence section of the 138th Tactical Fighter Group.
[01:38:48.194 --> 01:38:55.095]  He's the author, best-selling author, New York Times best-selling author, Crosshairs of the Kill Zone, The Medusafile, Doorway to Hell, Disaster in Somalia.
[01:38:56.256 --> 01:39:01.597]  Best-selling author of One Shot, One Kill, A Sniper Looks at Dealey Plaza, RifleWarrior.com.
[01:39:01.697 --> 01:39:02.137]  One word.
[01:39:02.737 --> 01:39:05.638]  Helicopter pilot for the Tulsa Police, SWAT team, you name it.
[01:39:06.179 --> 01:39:07.559]  Investigated Oklahoma City.
[01:39:07.939 --> 01:39:13.602]  And now, for the next 50 minutes, we're going to cover the waterfront with Colonel Craig Roberts.
[01:39:14.322 --> 01:39:20.825]  Craig, just overall, what do you make of the state of the world and so much of what you wrote about 15, 20 years ago coming true?
[01:39:21.205 --> 01:39:27.428]  Well, you know, it's amazing, Alex, because, you know, I had police officers that I worked with on the department.
[01:39:28.098 --> 01:39:36.002]  That several of them thought I was absolutely off the deep end and was wearing a tinfoil hat when I went home because I was talking about all of this stuff well in advance.
[01:39:36.062 --> 01:39:38.943]  I talked about 9-11 well in advance of what had happened.
[01:39:38.983 --> 01:39:44.186]  I wrote about it in the Medusa file, talking about the different types of terrorist targets when we were working the Oklahoma City bombing.
[01:39:45.675 --> 01:39:53.959]  You know, having my intelligence background in the military, being trained as a counter-terrorist, you know, we know there's five types of terrorist targets.
[01:39:54.039 --> 01:40:01.103]  You know, we've got mass transportation ground, mass transportation air, a large gathering of people, which we call the Black Sunday or the Super Bowl effect.
[01:40:02.543 --> 01:40:04.924]  Then we've got a public building and a private building.
[01:40:05.345 --> 01:40:10.127]  In 1993, they blew up the World Trade Center, or tried to, you know, the Ramsey-Joseph case.
[01:40:11.190 --> 01:40:14.314]  And that was a private building.
[01:40:14.814 --> 01:40:19.279]  The next thing we had was the Oklahoma City, which is a public building, which is a government building.
[01:40:19.699 --> 01:40:26.427]  The next thing we had was the Amtrak derailment out in California, or out in Arizona, which was mass transportation ground.
[01:40:26.607 --> 01:40:30.551]  And the next thing I said, we're going to have a major airliner go down, and it wasn't.
[01:40:30.591 --> 01:40:31.953]  Just a few months later, we had TW800 get shot down.
[01:40:33.574 --> 01:40:37.875]  And it was shot down, and everybody thinks it was a center fuel tank explosion that was living in La La Land.
[01:40:38.955 --> 01:40:43.457]  Then we predicted 9-11 as a large gathering of people happening someplace, and it happened.
[01:40:43.857 --> 01:40:52.939]  And so, you know, we talked about all this stuff, and, you know, here 15 years later, I've got these same police officers that have come to me and said, do you know any place out in the country we can buy property and move to?
[01:40:52.999 --> 01:40:56.060]  Because the whole world's going to do exactly what you said it's happened.
[01:40:56.180 --> 01:40:58.140]  The economy's going belly up.
[01:40:58.481 --> 01:41:00.121]  There's traders in the White House.
[01:41:01.083 --> 01:41:04.732]  You know, the entire world right now is on the brink of total disaster.
[01:41:04.752 --> 01:41:08.682]  These are guys that 15 years ago thought I was a lunatic.
[01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:11.080]  And now they're coming to me for advice.
[01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:28.344]  So, uh, you know, when you have cops doing that, then you better, you better stand by because there's a lot of people who work in cubicles and, you know, they may listen to the radio, they may watch some TV, but they're more wrapped up in, you know, their, their Saturday and Sunday and Monday sports and, you know, what they're going to do when they get off that night and things like that.
[01:41:28.884 --> 01:41:32.845]  And, uh, unless they lose their job and get desperate, they don't pay attention to what's going on in the world.
[01:41:33.225 --> 01:41:37.826]  And right now, today, we're seeing all kinds of stuff not happening just here.
[01:41:38.504 --> 01:41:40.826]  Where this country is getting ready to go belly up financially.
[01:41:41.747 --> 01:41:45.470]  And our food supplies, we're having problems with that.
[01:41:45.510 --> 01:41:46.912]  We're having problems with our water supplies.
[01:41:46.952 --> 01:41:48.673]  There's all these things that are happening.
[01:41:48.693 --> 01:41:49.614]  We're having more.
[01:41:51.138 --> 01:41:54.739]  Major emergencies in the world today that we have ever had before.
[01:41:55.300 --> 01:42:00.321]  And, you know, you're looking at tsunamis, volcanoes, earthquakes, hurricanes, Florida alone.
[01:42:00.841 --> 01:42:07.444]  Giant fires, reactors in Nebraska flooding, lying about Fukushima.
[01:42:08.144 --> 01:42:10.125]  And you go over all of this.
[01:42:10.145 --> 01:42:12.025]  I mean, there's obviously a hand involved.
[01:42:12.145 --> 01:42:13.326]  We know they have weather weapons.
[01:42:13.706 --> 01:42:15.707]  There's so much to get into with you today.
[01:42:17.072 --> 01:42:18.252]  You mentioned financial collapse.
[01:42:18.272 --> 01:42:20.093]  Here's the Financial Times of London today.
[01:42:20.753 --> 01:42:22.894]  Dollars seen losing global reserve status.
[01:42:22.934 --> 01:42:29.335]  I don't think people realize that America has to be brought down before the world government, which they've openly announced.
[01:42:29.355 --> 01:42:30.216]  I mean, think about that.
[01:42:30.296 --> 01:42:34.997]  All the publications now saying a world government is the answer to our problems.
[01:42:35.017 --> 01:42:36.757]  A world private bank.
[01:42:37.137 --> 01:42:38.698]  That's what we always knew was coming.
[01:42:38.738 --> 01:42:39.278]  Now it's here.
[01:42:40.151 --> 01:42:42.273]  America has always been the castle on the hill.
[01:42:42.854 --> 01:42:45.756]  The rest of the world has always been the peasants outside the castle.
[01:42:46.136 --> 01:42:47.978]  They are now storming the castle.
[01:42:47.998 --> 01:42:49.279]  They're doing everything they can.
[01:42:49.319 --> 01:42:53.062]  We are under siege, economically and commercially.
[01:42:53.083 --> 01:42:56.706]  And, you know, our borders are wide open.
[01:42:56.946 --> 01:43:02.611]  And we've got the globalists, you know, in Washington, D.C., in the government right now, from the White House on down.
[01:43:02.651 --> 01:43:07.035]  They're doing everything they can to turn this into a global socialist society.
[01:43:07.755 --> 01:43:21.683]  And when you don't enforce your own voters, and you send, you know, the legions far afield, so to speak, we've got them in Afghanistan and Iraq and South Korea and who knows where, and there's no one home to watch the chickens, then we are ripe for the picking.
[01:43:21.723 --> 01:43:23.764]  And right now, that's where we're at.
[01:43:24.244 --> 01:43:36.851]  And they're succeeding in doing what they want, and ignoring the law, ignoring the Constitution, ignoring the voices of the people, and they're totally out of control of the people, but they're not out of control of the globalists.
[01:43:37.395 --> 01:43:46.944]  The Council of 13, the Council of 33, George Soros, all the rest of those groups that are all intertwined and doing everything they can to bring this country together.
[01:43:46.984 --> 01:43:48.806]  And by the way, the CIA, U.S.
[01:43:48.846 --> 01:43:50.267]  intelligence, you've told the stories.
[01:43:50.927 --> 01:43:52.929]  People in high-level intelligence, they all know this.
[01:43:52.989 --> 01:43:54.631]  This is not a secret.
[01:43:55.472 --> 01:44:01.017]  And expanding on that, they're creating the crises to then offer the solution.
[01:44:02.825 --> 01:44:12.533]  Going through these issues one by one, breaking down the fact that the first World Trade Center, the FBI cooked the bomb, trained the drivers.
[01:44:13.554 --> 01:44:15.215]  We're not saying there aren't Muslim extremists.
[01:44:15.255 --> 01:44:20.239]  The point is, there's an unseen hand, the underwear bomber, helped to get on the plane by the U.S.
[01:44:20.259 --> 01:44:23.161]  State Department, now on record, over and over again.
[01:44:24.042 --> 01:44:25.263]  In Egypt, they're putting them in.
[01:44:25.283 --> 01:44:27.405]  They're using Al-Qaeda to go after Gaddafi.
[01:44:27.445 --> 01:44:28.286]  This is all admitted.
[01:44:28.546 --> 01:44:39.334]  From your research into this, can you explain for newbies what the New World Order, you know, Globalist Council is, what their goal is, and how they use terrorism to take our liberties?
[01:44:39.855 --> 01:44:45.259]  Well, you know, what we call the New World Order is not new at all.
[01:44:45.720 --> 01:44:46.760]  It's, you know, at least 200 years old.
[01:44:47.947 --> 01:44:55.638]  And it goes back to the ancient families of Europe who conspired together to take over the various monarchies of Europe.
[01:44:56.259 --> 01:44:59.844]  You can talk about the Rothschilds and all the rest of them, the Bowers and so on and so forth.
[01:45:00.265 --> 01:45:03.930]  But the bottom line is there's a core group of pure evil.
[01:45:05.084 --> 01:45:11.326]  And they conspired, you know, decades and decades ago to come up with a plan on how to take over the world.
[01:45:11.346 --> 01:45:16.068]  Well, you do it one country at a time or two countries at a time by pitting those two countries against each other.
[01:45:16.648 --> 01:45:25.451]  You know, the Rothschild plan said, you know, you support both countries during war and loan them money, and at the end it doesn't matter who wins or loses because they're both in your debt.
[01:45:25.531 --> 01:45:26.631]  And debt is power.
[01:45:27.418 --> 01:45:43.630]  Now, they turn around and they run the economic systems of countries, and they can control the jobs, they can control the banks, they can control the flow of money, they can control the value of money, they control the gold and the silver and the other precious metals, they control the jewels, and then that is total control.
[01:45:43.710 --> 01:45:48.434]  Politics, political control, means nothing to these people as long as they're the ones calling the shots.
[01:45:48.714 --> 01:45:51.336]  And they've been doing this, you know, for decades and decades.
[01:45:52.230 --> 01:45:59.895]  And what they've decided was the way to rule the world is to rule the world by controlling the world's assets.
[01:46:00.416 --> 01:46:03.318]  That means the food, the oil, the water.
[01:46:03.851 --> 01:46:08.074]  The air we breathe, the weather now, today, that's an asset.
[01:46:08.915 --> 01:46:11.176]  Because if you can make it rain, you can make it flood.
[01:46:11.216 --> 01:46:12.977]  If you can make it dry, you can make it drought.
[01:46:14.118 --> 01:46:17.000]  And so, they're able to control these different various things.
[01:46:17.500 --> 01:46:26.667]  And right now, the whole thing is being able to take all the countries in the third world status and elevate them to first world status.
[01:46:27.087 --> 01:46:32.491]  And because you improve those countries, they're all in your debt and they're all very grateful to you and they follow your orders.
[01:46:33.169 --> 01:46:39.252]  But to do that, they have to get this, redistribute the wealth, and open the borders of the first world countries.
[01:46:39.732 --> 01:46:45.155]  You know, I used to give lectures, and I would say, uh, can you name one second world country?
[01:46:46.095 --> 01:46:48.556]  There'd be a hundred people in the room, and no one even knew what I was talking about.
[01:46:48.576 --> 01:46:49.737]  What do you mean a second world country?
[01:46:50.097 --> 01:46:53.618]  Well, we talk about the first world countries, and we talk about second world countries.
[01:46:53.678 --> 01:46:55.919]  This is what we've been programmed to believe exists.
[01:46:56.480 --> 01:46:58.601]  But can anybody name a second world country?
[01:47:00.485 --> 01:47:10.428]  And basically, a second-world country is what you have when you redistribute the wealth, and that includes the assets and the resources from the first-world countries to the third-world countries.
[01:47:10.948 --> 01:47:18.451]  Open the borders, you know, take from the rich, give to the poor, all the rest of that communist nonsense, and you elevate them to second-world status.
[01:47:18.471 --> 01:47:26.653]  At the same time, you reduce us to second-world status, and then we have a one-world order, or what we used to call the New World Order.
[01:47:27.033 --> 01:47:29.354]  Everybody's on the same plane except the rulers.
[01:47:30.919 --> 01:47:38.486]  The mega-rich basically creating a collectivist society where the general public is absolutely dependent on them and will do whatever they're told.
[01:47:39.146 --> 01:47:40.327]  This is domestication.
[01:47:40.388 --> 01:47:44.912]  Now, part of this program is the police state, and we talked about that this morning.
[01:47:45.372 --> 01:47:54.080]  Your view of the TSA, the clergy response teams, the spy grids that are going in, and when you get the internal documents that we were sent years ago by law enforcement,
[01:47:55.603 --> 01:47:57.527]  None of that even has to do with Al Qaeda.
[01:47:57.948 --> 01:48:02.977]  It's all about gun owners, landowners, Ron Paul supporters, people that want to end the New World Order.
[01:48:03.779 --> 01:48:04.460]  Expand on that.
[01:48:05.137 --> 01:48:06.659]  Well, it all has to do with control.
[01:48:06.719 --> 01:48:10.142]  If you can't control every element of society, you're not the boss yet.
[01:48:10.162 --> 01:48:11.083]  You're not in control yet.
[01:48:11.123 --> 01:48:12.965]  So you have to be in control.
[01:48:12.985 --> 01:48:19.531]  One of the things you have to do if you're trying to subjugate a population, you have to disarm it.
[01:48:20.052 --> 01:48:23.475]  It doesn't do any good for the peasants to have pitchforks because you might get stuck.
[01:48:23.915 --> 01:48:26.398]  So you have to do everything you can to disarm the peasants.
[01:48:26.418 --> 01:48:29.421]  And if you can't disarm them, at least reduce their firepower.
[01:48:30.322 --> 01:48:44.374]  Uh, you know, just talking about the guns alone, in this country, you know, we had the Gun Control Act of 1968, uh, we've had the Brady Bill go through, we've had all of these things, but it started out back, you know, in the 1930s, you could own a Thompson submachine gun and buy it at any hardware store.
[01:48:44.414 --> 01:48:47.136]  Today, you have to get a special license to own an automatic weapon.
[01:48:47.697 --> 01:48:52.021]  Uh, you can't own anything larger than a certain size caliber, blah, blah, blah.
[01:48:52.974 --> 01:48:58.336]  So then, you know, that takes us into this Operation Gunwalker and so on and so forth.
[01:48:58.636 --> 01:49:15.222]  If they can't legislate through Congress more gun control than they've already got, what they want to do is they want to regulate us through emergencies, such as, gee, look at all the guns that are going to Mexico and causing all of the havoc below the border with the drug cartels.
[01:49:15.362 --> 01:49:17.823]  All the drug cartels are getting these guns out of our gun shops.
[01:49:18.363 --> 01:49:19.883]  There's no control over the gun shops.
[01:49:19.963 --> 01:49:20.624]  Blah, blah, blah.
[01:49:22.154 --> 01:49:24.838]  Anybody who believes that has never bought a gun.
[01:49:25.379 --> 01:49:38.236]  If you go into a gun shop today, you fill out a two-page form with all your statistics on it, you answer questions, and if you answer any of them wrong, including straw purchaser, that's a felony, and you can go to federal prison.
[01:49:38.598 --> 01:49:45.104]  But we know the vast majority of guns in Mexico, where they have a total gun ban society, are bought from the military.
[01:49:45.124 --> 01:49:47.627]  They're grenade launchers, they're fully auto, they're German.
[01:49:48.087 --> 01:49:57.175]  And so the White House, two years ago, sort of demonizing and said, we want to ban multi-sale, semi-auto, via Fiat, via emergency, as you said.
[01:49:57.195 --> 01:49:58.297]  Those memos are now public.
[01:49:59.218 --> 01:50:09.760]  And now we've caught them, because good ATF guys went public, and that they were unknowingly helping get them shipped down to Mexico, and then they lied to Congress.
[01:50:09.820 --> 01:50:10.680]  I mean, this is incredible.
[01:50:11.420 --> 01:50:23.563]  Oh yeah, and you know, you've got people going in there buying hundreds of guns at a gun dealer, and the gun dealer's screaming, hey, this is not right, I shouldn't be doing this, and you've got ATF people saying, no, go ahead and do it, we're in charge, everything's okay.
[01:50:23.583 --> 01:50:25.323]  So the ATF is telling
[01:50:26.615 --> 01:50:32.933]  Uh, private business to violate the law and become criminals themselves and be felons by violating federal law.
[01:50:33.709 --> 01:50:34.930]  They're not on the federal payroll.
[01:50:35.110 --> 01:50:36.450]  They're not law enforcement officers.
[01:50:36.470 --> 01:50:37.791]  They're not obligated to do this.
[01:50:38.251 --> 01:50:40.212]  And when they do it, they're putting themselves in jeopardy.
[01:50:40.232 --> 01:50:44.293]  So now, if they turn around and say, no, well, we'll file charges on you because of what you already did in the past.
[01:50:44.353 --> 01:50:45.394]  That's right.
[01:50:45.754 --> 01:50:47.355]  It's a Whitey Bulger tactic.
[01:50:47.395 --> 01:50:49.616]  I mean, it's the government becoming mafia.
[01:50:49.976 --> 01:50:52.617]  We'll be right back with Colonel Craig Roberts.
[01:50:52.637 --> 01:50:55.278]  We're going to continue to look at Operation Fast and Furious.
[01:50:55.298 --> 01:50:56.659]  We'll talk about the TSA.
[01:50:57.179 --> 01:50:59.400]  We'll look at what's happening in the Middle East and a lot more.
[01:50:59.420 --> 01:50:59.820]  Stay with us.
[01:51:00.140 --> 01:51:02.503]  What would you do with a check for $25,000?
[01:51:02.663 --> 01:51:07.789]  What if you could eliminate all of your credit card debt in 90 days and keep all of your money?
[01:51:07.969 --> 01:51:18.262]  Hi, I'm Jason Davenport, and I've just completed ZeroDebt100.com, a program that stops and prevents debt collections of all kinds, including debt collectors and foreclosures, with guaranteed results.
[01:51:18.482 --> 01:51:19.723]  Forget loan modifications.
[01:51:19.783 --> 01:51:25.988]  Zero Debt showed me how to get the banks to pay my property taxes and insurance while stopping my foreclosure without paying one dime.
[01:51:26.148 --> 01:51:31.432]  An attorney tried to garnish my wages, but the court denied his request because of what I filed from the Zero Debt program.

[01:54:00.426 --> 01:54:02.706]  All over the country,
[01:54:27.819 --> 01:54:35.183]  The federal government started beating the drum that our guns are causing the Mexican crises, which everybody knew that was ridiculous.
[01:54:35.203 --> 01:54:37.124]  It's the corrupt society, the drug war, all of it.
[01:54:38.465 --> 01:54:41.427]  They lie and say it's our guns, so they start going to gun shows.
[01:54:41.447 --> 01:54:42.147]  They did it in Austin.
[01:54:42.167 --> 01:54:45.789]  They didn't have any legals go in and all day try to do a private purchase.
[01:54:45.829 --> 01:54:53.294]  Not from a gun dealer, but somebody trying to sell their private gun to shut down, quote, the gun show loophole, which is nothing but gun registration.
[01:54:54.181 --> 01:54:57.663]  And then they go into these gun shops and tell them, you're going to sell hundreds of guns.
[01:54:58.444 --> 01:54:59.584]  And now it's starting to come out.
[01:54:59.604 --> 01:55:02.946]  It was basically the ATF had set the whole thing up.
[01:55:02.986 --> 01:55:05.868]  It was their sub criminal group.
[01:55:05.888 --> 01:55:13.412]  That's what they're scared is about to come out fully coming in and buying them, then bringing them back and then trying to get them back into the U.S.
[01:55:13.472 --> 01:55:17.475]  or trying to connect them to crimes in Mexico to frame the Second Amendment.
[01:55:18.055 --> 01:55:19.756]  And I said this a year and a half ago.
[01:55:19.977 --> 01:55:23.039]  Now they've been caught doing it.
[01:55:23.800 --> 01:55:28.683]  Colonel Craig Roberts looking at this, there should be an immediate move for impeachment immediately.
[01:55:28.704 --> 01:55:32.206]  I mean, is this not seditious behavior against the Republic?
[01:55:32.587 --> 01:55:33.227]  Well, absolutely.
[01:55:33.247 --> 01:55:42.755]  You know, I mean, when you go out and purposely violate the law, violate your own laws, you know, where does it stop?
[01:55:42.815 --> 01:55:43.535]  You can't do that.
[01:55:43.595 --> 01:55:44.376]  You can't have
[01:55:45.023 --> 01:55:52.066]  You know, we just had three police officers here go to trial and one of them ended up going to prison after doing over 20 years on the police department.
[01:55:52.086 --> 01:56:01.489]  He was already retired because at one time the way that they handled their informants and the drug deals and the drug money and what they were doing with it and so on down the line,
[01:56:02.250 --> 01:56:02.710]  I don't think so.
[01:56:22.472 --> 01:56:24.692]  Well, it was the law enforcement, which is about as corrupt as their government.
[01:56:24.752 --> 01:56:25.673]  It wasn't involved in it.
[01:56:25.693 --> 01:56:27.553]  There was no way to track these guns.
[01:56:27.573 --> 01:56:34.074]  What they were doing was they were making sure that hundreds, if not thousands, of guns were ending up south of the border.
[01:56:34.094 --> 01:56:49.177]  They could be traced back here so that when they did end up in crimes on our side of the border, we could say, look, these came from American gun shops because they knew that if they didn't supply the guns and make sure that they got down there, that the guns they did find would have come from Colombia,
[01:56:49.977 --> 01:56:55.841]  Uh, you know, Panama, uh, Costa Rica, you know, Guatemala, uh, El Salvador, Germany.
[01:56:56.181 --> 01:56:56.842]  Yeah, Germany.
[01:57:19.898 --> 01:57:22.162]  Internally, I mean, this is a group of criminals.
[01:57:22.423 --> 01:57:24.728]  Well, yeah, and here's another deal.
[01:57:24.768 --> 01:57:27.854]  You've got one, just one drug cartel down there has 19 airliners.
[01:57:30.515 --> 01:57:34.799]  Four-engine, two-engine jet airliners that they can fly anywhere in the globe hauling drugs.
[01:57:35.399 --> 01:57:51.534]  They can fly to Russia, they can fly to the Middle East, and they can trade those drugs for all the fully automatic Kalashnikovs, and AR- or M-16s, or FN FALs they want, and bring them back by the caseload, and grenade launchers, and RPGs, and they could buy tanks if they wanted them.
[01:57:52.334 --> 01:57:57.978]  By the way, now they've got giant armored vehicles that look bigger than Blackwater's Grizzly.
[01:57:58.278 --> 01:57:59.679]  Yeah, they call them the narco tanks.
[01:58:00.860 --> 01:58:03.482]  But they got that at a gun shop, Colonel.
[01:58:03.742 --> 01:58:04.523]  Yeah, right.
[01:58:04.543 --> 01:58:05.564]  They just went in and got one.
[01:58:05.784 --> 01:58:07.085]  They had probably a dozen of them out back.
[01:58:08.645 --> 01:58:13.047]  These people, you know, are capable of getting anything they want, anytime they want.
[01:58:13.067 --> 01:58:14.928]  They've got all the money in the world to do it with.
[01:58:15.409 --> 01:58:17.309]  They've got all the contacts to do it with.
[01:58:17.930 --> 01:58:22.172]  They don't need some piddly gun shop in Tucson, Arizona to sell them guns.
[01:58:22.452 --> 01:58:26.814]  Our government has people in it that says, oh, wait a minute, we can't have that.
[01:58:26.934 --> 01:58:30.355]  We gotta have our guns end up in the hands of the narco-terrorists.
[01:58:30.395 --> 01:58:32.116]  Look, is it not a false flag?
[01:58:32.136 --> 01:58:33.417]  I mean, is this not stage terror?
[01:58:33.777 --> 01:58:34.377]  Yeah, it is.
[01:58:34.457 --> 01:58:36.778]  It creates a problem so we can have a solution.
[01:58:36.798 --> 01:58:37.459]  Stay there, Colonel.
[01:58:37.499 --> 01:58:38.219]  Back in one minute.

[02:00:26.465 --> 02:00:28.467]  Man, there is so much news to go over.
[02:00:28.587 --> 02:00:30.249]  Greece is teetering on the edge.
[02:00:30.269 --> 02:00:31.630]  They're holding the country hostage.
[02:00:31.650 --> 02:00:36.735]  The foreign banks are saying, turn your entire population's GDP over to us or we're going to bankrupt you.
[02:00:38.897 --> 02:00:47.104]  The Project Gunrunner whistleblower is under fire, even though the head of the ATF's been caught lying in emails.
[02:00:47.965 --> 02:00:49.327]  Now we know, lied to Congress.
[02:00:50.339 --> 02:00:51.700]  That they did know it was going on.
[02:00:52.120 --> 02:00:57.585]  They said they knew nothing, but it turned out the highest levels ordered it and had video cameras installed in the gun shops.
[02:00:58.165 --> 02:01:15.820]  I mean, this is a big deal, Colonel Roberts, because if they've been caught setting this up, lying to Congress, lying to the public, and doing it to blame the Second Amendment, and they'd already launched the demonization by the time they got caught, and the head of the ATF is refusing to step down, where is Congress
[02:01:17.099 --> 02:01:18.081]  Hauling this guy in.
[02:01:18.382 --> 02:01:19.785]  Where's the Justice Department?
[02:01:19.945 --> 02:01:25.296]  Oh, the head of the Justice Department was the deputy head of the Justice Department who helped cover things up at OKC.
[02:01:25.696 --> 02:01:27.761]  Now I understand why nobody's getting in trouble.
[02:01:28.260 --> 02:01:30.742]  Well, you know, first, we've got a weak Congress.
[02:01:30.882 --> 02:01:32.343]  There are a bunch of weak sisters up there.
[02:01:32.363 --> 02:01:35.725]  You know, the Tea Party guys went up there, but I haven't seen them really do a lot yet.
[02:01:39.028 --> 02:01:42.450]  They all get up there, drink the Potomac River water, and they all become part of the system.
[02:01:42.510 --> 02:01:45.472]  It's just out of control.
[02:01:45.933 --> 02:01:56.180]  But the thing about it is, every one of these people in this chain of command that not only thought this up, but implemented it, and then, and I'm not talking about the field agents that were told to do it, I'm talking about the brass.
[02:01:57.066 --> 02:01:58.527]  ...needs to go to prison.
[02:01:58.967 --> 02:01:59.728]  It's as simple as that.
[02:01:59.988 --> 02:02:09.073]  They broke the law intentionally, and they did it for some very terrible, evil purposes, and that was to subjugate the Constitution, pure and simple.
[02:02:09.293 --> 02:02:10.553]  I mean, let's just get to the point here.
[02:02:11.174 --> 02:02:13.895]  And every one of them needs to go to trial, and they need to go to federal penitentiary.
[02:02:14.135 --> 02:02:18.217]  Because if they don't, no one in the world can be guilty of a crime again, period, in this country.
[02:02:18.257 --> 02:02:19.018]  That's just the way it is.
[02:02:19.098 --> 02:02:20.479]  If they escape, everybody should escape.
[02:02:20.499 --> 02:02:22.800]  They might as well just open up all the prisons and let everybody out.
[02:02:23.380 --> 02:02:29.510]  Because, you know, there's no such thing as someone that's immune from the law just because of their position or who they work for.
[02:02:30.351 --> 02:02:32.814]  And, you know, we've got police officers go to jail all the time.
[02:02:33.155 --> 02:02:34.958]  Politicians sometimes go to jail.
[02:02:34.998 --> 02:02:36.920]  But, you know, I saw this Blake Oliver.
[02:02:37.785 --> 02:02:39.126]  What's his name, Blagojevich?
[02:02:39.186 --> 02:02:39.926]  Yeah, Blagojevich.
[02:02:39.946 --> 02:02:41.467]  I can't ever say it.
[02:02:41.487 --> 02:02:44.988]  But anyway, he gets convicted on what, 17 counts?
[02:02:45.408 --> 02:02:45.628]  Yes.
[02:02:46.008 --> 02:02:47.069]  And I don't see him in jail yet.
[02:02:47.449 --> 02:02:48.850]  I don't see him doing the perp walk yet.
[02:02:48.870 --> 02:02:53.151]  Well, more than that, he's obviously a slime bag, but they've destroyed most of the tapes.
[02:02:53.191 --> 02:02:56.473]  We know Obama and all of them are involved in the same stuff.
[02:02:57.233 --> 02:02:59.636]  And Obama getting free houses and all this.
[02:03:00.577 --> 02:03:10.468]  And we see a low-level vice president at Citibank getting indicted for supposedly stealing $19 million, but he stole it from the bankers.
[02:03:10.949 --> 02:03:11.750]  But then when
[02:03:12.964 --> 02:03:20.389]  Megabanks like Wells Fargo and their subsidiary are caught laundering $376 billion in two years.
[02:03:20.809 --> 02:03:21.970]  Confirmed they did it.
[02:03:22.530 --> 02:03:23.531]  They don't even get in trouble.
[02:03:23.911 --> 02:03:26.613]  So they always burn little low-level people.
[02:03:27.653 --> 02:03:28.694]  Oh yeah.
[02:03:28.834 --> 02:03:40.181]  And if you start chasing, like I did in some of my books, if you start chasing the narco money over the last 30 years, or all the way back to Vietnam, let's go all the way back to
[02:03:42.164 --> 02:03:46.875]  Uh, the Golden Triangle days when Shaq Lynn Clines and all that bunch were there.
[02:03:47.717 --> 02:03:51.306]  Uh, and all the opium was coming out of the Golden Triangle and Laos.
[02:03:52.271 --> 02:04:14.643]  And you start following everything from the Nugent Hand Bank to the WDNPB or whatever it was back in Honolulu to the BCCI, you know, the Bank of North Little Rock and all the rest of these banks that are involved in money laundering and to Iran-Contra and to the cocaine coming out of the Medellin and Cali cartels that were set up both by the CIA, or at least by Ted Shackley.
[02:04:15.403 --> 02:04:25.266]  Uh, you start chasing all this stuff, and then you find the money goes into Middle Eastern banks, it goes into the Caymans, and it goes into the New York City megabanks, and that's where it gets laundered.
[02:04:25.326 --> 02:04:30.688]  So all the drugs that they buy in Mexico eventually gets laundered through New York City and the megabanks, so they're protected.
[02:04:32.739 --> 02:04:42.682]  It's incredible and they then bust some of the low-level competition and then fill the presence with non-violent offenders while the violent go free.
[02:04:43.282 --> 02:04:44.263]  Colonel Craig Roberts is our guest.
[02:04:44.283 --> 02:04:46.883]  We're going to continue picking his brain on a host of issues.
[02:04:46.903 --> 02:04:53.465]  We're going to get his take next on the TSA and see what his view is of the overall police state here in the Republic.
[02:04:53.786 --> 02:04:58.207]  We'll get more into the economy as well with Colonel Craig Roberts on the other side.
[02:05:04.238 --> 02:05:05.179]  Tyranny is here.
[02:05:05.499 --> 02:05:09.183]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:05:09.363 --> 02:05:11.645]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:05:11.665 --> 02:05:17.110]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:05:17.530 --> 02:05:23.756]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:05:24.196 --> 02:05:29.719]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:05:30.140 --> 02:05:33.822]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:05:34.342 --> 02:05:38.345]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:05:38.645 --> 02:05:44.128]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[02:05:44.588 --> 02:05:47.550]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:05:48.130 --> 02:05:49.551]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:05:50.111 --> 02:05:50.532]  It's here.

[02:06:59.568 --> 02:07:03.811]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:07:04.111 --> 02:07:04.391]  Number 1.
[02:07:05.031 --> 02:07:08.193]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:07:08.454 --> 02:07:09.014]  Number 2.
[02:07:09.314 --> 02:07:13.857]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:07:14.217 --> 02:07:14.658]  It's true.
[02:07:14.958 --> 02:07:19.521]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:07:19.821 --> 02:07:20.361]  Number 3.
[02:07:20.641 --> 02:07:23.923]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:07:24.244 --> 02:07:27.946]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:07:28.126 --> 02:07:28.687]  Number 4.
[02:07:28.927 --> 02:07:31.290]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:07:31.690 --> 02:07:35.074]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:07:35.374 --> 02:07:35.915]  Number 5.
[02:07:36.175 --> 02:07:40.079]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:07:40.320 --> 02:07:45.085]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:07:45.365 --> 02:07:49.390]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:49.530 --> 02:07:51.092]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:08:09.735 --> 02:08:10.555]  You want answers?
[02:08:11.336 --> 02:08:12.176]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:12.877 --> 02:08:16.459]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:17.059 --> 02:08:21.122]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:32.964 --> 02:08:46.310]  We're scheduled to have Ron Paul on with us in about 25 minutes, then I'm going to go into overdrive, internet only, at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv in the fourth hour to talk to Webster Griffin Tarpoli, who's in Tripoli, joining us from there.
[02:08:46.430 --> 02:08:55.394]  But the radio show's three hours, but we continue at PrisonPlanet.tv some days into the fourth hour for folks when there's just too much news that we can't cram in.
[02:08:56.674 --> 02:08:57.374]  The three hours.
[02:08:58.355 --> 02:09:03.137]  Going over some of the headlines with Colonel Craig Roberts of RifleWarrior.com who joins us.
[02:09:03.717 --> 02:09:07.479]  Fukushima in Nebraska, rising floodwaters threaten nuclear catastrophe.
[02:09:08.019 --> 02:09:09.940]  Locals told us two weeks ago this was going on.
[02:09:09.980 --> 02:09:11.401]  Now AP and others confirm it.
[02:09:12.021 --> 02:09:13.622]  And they're on generator power.
[02:09:14.002 --> 02:09:17.423]  And it's with the history of the government lying, who knows what's going to happen.
[02:09:17.803 --> 02:09:20.525]  Los Alamos has had fires go right up to their facilities.
[02:09:21.585 --> 02:09:26.271]  And that whole area is radioactive from testing, so the fires reignite that and put it into the atmosphere.
[02:09:26.351 --> 02:09:30.696]  Radiation levels are going up, so the EPA has just raised the level of what they say safe.
[02:09:31.157 --> 02:09:35.402]  Also, cancer surges in body scanner operators, TSA launching cover-up.
[02:09:35.922 --> 02:09:40.047]  This could bring the whole thing down, that the government knowingly, they've got the internal memos.
[02:09:41.388 --> 02:09:50.731]  From the TSA people, of them covering up the cancer clusters, the fact that they're being blasted with radiation, just incredible information in Paul Joseph Watson's article.
[02:09:51.031 --> 02:09:52.251]  Please get this out to everyone.
[02:09:52.291 --> 02:09:55.932]  Cancer surges and body scanner operators, TSA launching cover-up.
[02:09:56.812 --> 02:10:03.014]  Also, Greek Prime Minister says austerity is patriotic duty, even though 90 plus percent of the money is not owed by the Greek people.
[02:10:03.654 --> 02:10:07.555]  It's the central banks bought off their president and finance minister and got them to sign on to the debt.
[02:10:08.763 --> 02:10:09.664]  It's called too big to fail.
[02:10:09.744 --> 02:10:14.047]  Then you give them your tax money, then they charge you interest for you giving it to them.
[02:10:14.528 --> 02:10:16.490]  Yeah, that's how dumb they think we are.
[02:10:17.190 --> 02:10:24.056]  Continuing, a final Senate version of TSA bill in Texas, instead of stopping the TSA groping, authorizes it.
[02:10:24.736 --> 02:10:25.637]  Now that's incredible.
[02:10:25.657 --> 02:10:31.622]  The first bill said Fourth Amendment, you have no reasonable suspicion, you have no probable cause.
[02:10:32.063 --> 02:10:34.925]  Well now the bill says, well Texas redefines reasonable suspicion.
[02:10:35.325 --> 02:10:36.867]  So the bill was going to put them in jail.
[02:10:40.407 --> 02:10:42.509]  And it would force them to actually engage in regional suspicion.
[02:10:42.529 --> 02:10:45.872]  Now they're saying reasonable suspicion is just that you're at an airport.
[02:10:46.432 --> 02:10:56.821]  And it's actual, the Texas Law Enforcement Association, made up of political, you know, police chiefs that are mainly federalized, they came out and went to Texas and said, we don't like this.
[02:10:56.901 --> 02:10:58.642]  We want to do what the feds are doing.
[02:10:58.662 --> 02:10:59.923]  This is a great new horizon.
[02:11:00.323 --> 02:11:07.770]  So they, so David Dewhurst, the minion, and also Strauss, the Speaker of the House, along with Al Gore's former campaign chairman,
[02:11:09.733 --> 02:11:19.660]  Rick Perry, they killed the bill and brought it back and changed it saying that basically the TSA can give your one-year-old a proctology exam.
[02:11:19.921 --> 02:11:21.402]  Now that's political spin.
[02:11:21.742 --> 02:11:26.185]  We're going to tie your hands by throwing in the briar patch exactly what you want.
[02:11:26.506 --> 02:11:34.052]  Colonel Craig Roberts, what's your view on the TSA as a Marine, as an Army colonel, as a police officer, an investigator?
[02:11:34.392 --> 02:11:35.633]  What is your view of the TSA?
[02:11:35.973 --> 02:11:37.554]  Well, it's a typical deal.
[02:11:37.994 --> 02:11:40.116]  It's an agency created out of thin air.
[02:11:40.156 --> 02:11:46.220]  All of a sudden, overnight, utilizing personnel that had no training, no experience, and no expertise, and very little education.
[02:11:47.562 --> 02:12:04.353]  I remember right after 9-11, they just waved a magic wand and all of these low-grade magnetic gate screeners that they had hired off the street as civilian contractees that worked for civilian companies with a different company at every airport, all of a sudden became federal agents.
[02:12:04.653 --> 02:12:07.655]  No training, no academy, no understanding of the laws, nothing.
[02:12:08.155 --> 02:12:12.681]  And so you have a lot of these people who've got the wider syndrome.
[02:12:12.721 --> 02:12:13.502]  Power went to their head.
[02:12:13.562 --> 02:12:19.609]  I've got a badge and I'm powerful and I can be tough and look at me and I get to be the drill instructor here at the airport.
[02:12:19.649 --> 02:12:21.091]  You're going to line up and do what I say.
[02:12:22.100 --> 02:12:45.590]  It may have been also on purpose that they did this because you've got people like that who are basically like the brown shirts that eventually, because you have to go someplace, because you have to get on an airplane, because you have a schedule to keep, because you've got relatives to visit, business to do, whatever, you comply with get in line, shut up, take a number, do as we say.
[02:12:46.270 --> 02:12:50.252]  And once we get that cattle mentality,
[02:12:51.466 --> 02:12:55.729]  And we submit to that that it's very easy to control a population.
[02:12:55.769 --> 02:13:02.814]  You control a population in many ways, but one of the ways is by making them psychologically malleable to following orders.
[02:13:02.874 --> 02:13:03.695]  Don't ask questions.
[02:13:03.895 --> 02:13:04.455]  Bingo!
[02:13:04.555 --> 02:13:07.797]  And now it's spreading to high school proms with the TSA.
[02:13:07.857 --> 02:13:12.260]  Now it's spreading with the TSA is going to train and wave a magic wand.
[02:13:12.621 --> 02:13:18.285]  And now Texas police, New York police are suddenly allowed to grab your genitals and go down your pants.
[02:13:19.005 --> 02:13:28.773]  And now they're changing the definition of reasonable suspicion to, well, you're at a public place or we just feel like it.
[02:13:29.274 --> 02:13:33.837]  I mean, this is really the end of our common law, the end of basic liberty.
[02:13:34.318 --> 02:13:43.986]  And it's the same thing that British citizens went to war with the King of England over because he was stomping on their rights and doing the exact same type of garbage.
[02:13:44.540 --> 02:13:45.641]  Okay, now here's the deal.
[02:13:46.142 --> 02:13:47.042]  What do we do to stop it?
[02:13:47.142 --> 02:13:49.385]  Well, it's real simple, but no one's addressing the issue.
[02:13:50.486 --> 02:14:02.757]  What people don't understand is we've become this follow orders, do as you're told, don't make waves, the nail that sticks up, get the hammer, keep your mouth shut, and they'll get somebody else that won't bother you.
[02:14:02.797 --> 02:14:03.798]  You'll be able to go on your way.
[02:14:04.599 --> 02:14:07.922]  What you have to understand is that is when you look at the mechanism
[02:14:08.642 --> 02:14:09.143]  I think so.
[02:14:25.859 --> 02:14:31.845]  Violate your constitutional rights, such as the groping and the 4th Amendment stuff and all that sort of thing.
[02:14:32.425 --> 02:14:33.246]  You file on them.
[02:14:33.306 --> 02:14:37.250]  You sue them personally under 42 U.S.C.
[02:14:38.091 --> 02:14:37.250]  1983.
[02:14:38.611 --> 02:14:40.013]  That makes them personal.
[02:14:40.113 --> 02:14:43.236]  Their government position cannot protect them in a 1983 lawsuit.
[02:14:44.577 --> 02:14:57.118]  Well, you know as well as I, police have authority to make arrests, to do all those things because they are making a citizen's arrest and in the incorporated city under state law.
[02:14:58.163 --> 02:15:11.094]  The people are hiring you to be designated citizens with special training and weapons, but hired by us to serve, to go out, and it's the same power of citizen's arrest that does that.
[02:15:11.535 --> 02:15:16.799]  As soon as an officer steps out of the Constitution and Bill of Rights, they no longer have immunity.
[02:15:17.100 --> 02:15:23.585]  Citizens have immunity to shoot a robber coming in their house, just like a cop has the immunity to shoot a robber.
[02:15:24.346 --> 02:15:27.248]  If he comes to a house and catches a minute and the robber tries something.
[02:15:27.528 --> 02:15:28.829]  So it's the same power.
[02:15:29.089 --> 02:15:31.391]  They're trying to train us that we don't have that power.
[02:15:32.051 --> 02:15:36.974]  Or they're trying to tell us that out of control police are above the law or TSA are above the law.
[02:15:37.334 --> 02:15:40.536]  But as soon as they step out of the Constitution, they're wide open.
[02:15:40.937 --> 02:15:42.077]  Well, that's exactly right.
[02:15:42.157 --> 02:15:44.459]  And you know, 20 years ago,
[02:15:45.558 --> 02:15:47.500]  I had to go to in-service at the academy one day.
[02:15:47.520 --> 02:15:54.205]  He went in and a lawyer was there talking to us about 1983 lawsuits because they were starting to occur around the country.
[02:15:54.265 --> 02:15:55.426]  I had never even heard about it.
[02:15:56.264 --> 02:16:17.795]  And basically it was, if we stepped outside of our privileges given to us as law enforcement officers by the Constitution, and given to the citizens by the Constitution, if we violated their civil rights, you know, whether it's the Fourth Amendment or whatever, we became then personally responsible and were not under the protection of the Department.
[02:16:18.534 --> 02:16:21.576]  And on top of that, you can add vicarious liability.
[02:16:21.616 --> 02:16:33.865]  Vicarious liability says, I'm not only going to sue you, I'm going to sue your boss, and your boss's boss, and your boss's boss, individually, and go after your bank account, your pensions, your houses, and everything, and you can't be protected.
[02:16:33.985 --> 02:16:59.634]  And this is a big secret, like Ventura is personally suing, I was about to say Reno, same lady, different time, Napolitano, Mr. Napolitano, sorry, Mr. Maddow, I'm sorry, Janet Napolitano, I get them all confused, but the point is, they are going after her, and even if they, in their kangaroo court, beat it, you know what cops say, you beat the rap, you can't beat the ride.
[02:17:00.234 --> 02:17:10.161]  Yeah, well, when you start saying vicarious liability, that I'm not only going to sue you, son, I'm going to sue your boss and your boss's boss, and here it is, a 1942-1983 lawsuit.
[02:17:10.602 --> 02:17:11.402]  They know what that is.
[02:17:11.462 --> 02:17:17.467]  If they don't, they'll have somebody tell them what it is, and they're going to back off real quick, because right then, they become personally responsible.
[02:17:17.487 --> 02:17:18.868]  They don't hide in the crowd anymore.
[02:17:19.208 --> 02:17:23.151]  And once they become personally responsible, and it's their bank account, their pension,
[02:17:23.351 --> 02:17:23.732]  I don't know.
[02:17:40.410 --> 02:17:46.732]  Well, I was a few years ago protesting Rick Perry, and an Austin police commander came over with riot cops getting dressed.
[02:17:47.112 --> 02:17:51.094]  We were on the sidewalk, not blocking anything, and he said, I'm going to arrest you if you don't leave.
[02:17:51.134 --> 02:17:53.075]  And I said, well, Austin's lost lawsuits over this.
[02:17:53.095 --> 02:17:54.455]  And he said, I don't care.
[02:17:54.475 --> 02:17:55.776]  And this is on video.
[02:17:56.776 --> 02:17:58.817]  And I said, well, listen, I'm going to sue you personally.
[02:17:59.277 --> 02:18:02.658]  And I said, and this went on, he said, I'm still going to arrest you.
[02:18:02.938 --> 02:18:03.858]  And I said, you go ahead.
[02:18:03.918 --> 02:18:04.478]  I'm in the right.
[02:18:04.518 --> 02:18:05.118]  You're in the wrong.
[02:18:05.478 --> 02:18:09.500]  Why on earth would you want to violate the First Amendment that protects you and your family?
[02:18:09.860 --> 02:18:10.860]  And he finally went away.
[02:18:11.860 --> 02:18:18.122]  But I mean, cops just need to know the Bill of Rights and Constitution is there to protect them as well as everybody else.
[02:18:18.550 --> 02:18:23.272]  Well, the problem is, there's a lot of departments, especially the smaller ones, they get very little training on that.
[02:18:23.372 --> 02:18:30.594]  You know, they get a little bit of constitutional law when they go through the academy, and after that, except for once in a while at in-service, they really don't get it reinforced.
[02:18:31.074 --> 02:18:40.597]  They're so busy with their nose in the municipal code and the state statutes that they don't pay any attention to the federal law, they don't pay attention to the constitutional law.
[02:18:40.617 --> 02:18:42.598]  You know, when Jack McClam was traveling all around,
[02:18:43.018 --> 02:18:43.638]  I don't think so.
[02:19:04.465 --> 02:19:08.889]  We've only got one more segment coming up, and there's so many issues I want to get in to you.
[02:19:09.189 --> 02:19:11.331]  ColonelCraigRobertsRifleWarrior.com.
[02:19:11.772 --> 02:19:16.476]  I know you've got a bunch of best-selling books, but do you even sell books anymore there at the site?
[02:19:16.896 --> 02:19:22.001]  Well, I've got the New York City books through Simon & Schuster, you know, One Shot, One Kill.
[02:19:22.661 --> 02:19:22.962]  I think so.
[02:19:37.844 --> 02:19:39.246]  Yeah, that's where you really get deep.
[02:19:39.266 --> 02:19:43.571]  You can learn a lot from that book about how this whole criminal level network works.
[02:19:44.052 --> 02:19:45.814]  Colonel Craig Roberts is our guest.
[02:19:45.894 --> 02:19:47.576]  Ron Paul is scheduled to be coming up.
[02:19:48.037 --> 02:19:49.419]  I got a million things running through my head.
[02:19:49.459 --> 02:19:50.360]  What should I ask him?
[02:19:51.942 --> 02:19:52.563]  Boy, I tell you.
[02:19:53.444 --> 02:19:54.265]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:54.285 --> 02:19:54.726]  Stay with us.
[02:20:00.185 --> 02:20:04.509]  If you've ever wanted to grow the absolute best-tasting fruits and vegetables imaginable, here's some exciting news.
[02:20:04.710 --> 02:20:07.372]  There's a new product designed to make growing delicious produce easy.
[02:20:07.572 --> 02:20:09.975]  It's called Proto-Gro, and it's dynamite in the garden.
[02:20:10.195 --> 02:20:17.062]  Proto-Gro is a bioactive superfood for plants that works by providing true broad-spectrum nutrition, allowing plants to achieve their full genetic expression.
[02:20:17.222 --> 02:20:18.343]  What does this mean in the garden?
[02:20:18.423 --> 02:20:23.108]  It means mouth-watering fruits and vegetables, brilliantly colored flowers, herbs that finally grow to medicinal strength.
[02:20:23.268 --> 02:20:29.712]  Blue Ribbon Garden Produce, jam-packed with bioavailable minerals and trace elements, giant pumpkins, even high-potency, high-bricks wheatgrass.
[02:20:29.792 --> 02:20:32.834]  Proto-Gro is a proprietary blend of full-spectrum nutrients from the sea.
[02:20:32.994 --> 02:20:35.576]  It literally contains the basic building blocks of life itself.
[02:20:35.796 --> 02:20:42.800]  In fact, Proto-Gro is so effective at producing rapid plant growth in record time that it almost forces plants to grow, even under the worst light and soil conditions.
[02:20:43.080 --> 02:20:45.702]  It's also perfect for growing your own survival foods and might.
[02:20:45.762 --> 02:20:47.745]  Just be the ultimate hard times barter item.
[02:20:48.006 --> 02:20:51.751]  To grow tastier fruits and vegetables right now, go to growlikecrazy.com.

[02:20:53.995 --> 02:20:54.035]  877-327-0365.
[02:21:01.112 --> 02:21:09.439]  The folks at eFoodsDirect have saved you from the huge price increases on food by buying raw materials ahead and packing your supplies themselves.
[02:21:09.919 --> 02:21:13.902]  They haven't increased their prices on great long-term food reserves since last year.
[02:21:14.263 --> 02:21:19.347]  With the rising cost of raw materials and gas prices, they can't hold off any longer.
[02:21:19.987 --> 02:21:27.790]  As of July 1st, Ifu's Direct is forced to increase their prices so they can still ship you the best storable food on the planet.

[02:21:59.358 --> 02:22:05.560]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:22:06.021 --> 02:22:13.804]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:22:14.144 --> 02:22:21.987]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:22:22.307 --> 02:22:27.048]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:22:27.388 --> 02:22:32.129]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:22:32.609 --> 02:22:36.450]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:22:36.950 --> 02:22:37.970]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:38.030 --> 02:22:42.131]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[02:22:42.551 --> 02:22:46.912]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[02:22:47.432 --> 02:22:49.953]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[02:22:50.433 --> 02:22:52.094]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:52.194 --> 02:22:52.454]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:52.474 --> 02:22:54.095]  Will I have garlic breath after I take LEC?
[02:23:02.079 --> 02:23:14.951]  We get that question all the time about the world's best garlic extract, Alley C. And the answer is, Alley C contains stabilized allicin, nature's antimicrobial agent, and the active ingredient in crushed garlic, but will not give you garlic breath.
[02:23:15.271 --> 02:23:22.258]  Scientifically proven in double-blind studies, using low doses of allicin greatly reduces the number, severity, and duration of common colds.
[02:23:22.538 --> 02:23:26.403]  Our powerful Ali-C contains 300 milligrams of stabilized allicin.
[02:23:26.663 --> 02:23:30.507]  Just one tablet of Ali-C is equivalent to 40 garlic cloves.
[02:23:30.767 --> 02:23:37.555]  It's effective against asthma, MRSA, bacterial fungal and viral infections, and helps lower high blood pressure and high cholesterol.
[02:23:37.655 --> 02:23:39.617]  Plus, it's a natural mosquito repellent.
[02:23:39.758 --> 02:23:42.681]  Boost resistance to infection with nature's best garlic extract.
[02:23:43.001 --> 02:23:48.125]  Ali C. For more information and to order Ali C., call 877-888-7126 or go to GarlicHealthProducts.com.
[02:23:48.165 --> 02:23:50.246]  That's 877-888-7126 or GarlicHealthProducts.com.
[02:23:50.266 --> 02:23:51.067]  Fight back with Ali C.
[02:24:11.449 --> 02:24:15.291]  Colonel Craig Roberts in closing wants to get into some new Oklahoma City developments.
[02:24:15.311 --> 02:24:23.515]  For those that don't know, he worked the case and also investigated the murder of police officer Terrence Yakey by the feds.
[02:24:24.716 --> 02:24:28.197]  Cop of the year, he was one of the first on scene and actually saw what was going on.
[02:24:28.218 --> 02:24:31.539]  A lot of new developments on Oklahoma City front.
[02:24:31.939 --> 02:24:36.141]  Colonel Craig Roberts, you've been tracking this since it happened 16 years ago.
[02:24:36.161 --> 02:24:37.162]  What's the latest info?
[02:24:38.001 --> 02:24:47.307]  Well, you know, there's a lot of questions that are coming up now on the Middle Eastern connection, which is what we were really leaning on back, you know, in 95 and 96.
[02:24:48.307 --> 02:24:54.251]  And that Reno and Free and Clinton all said there is no Middle Eastern connection.
[02:24:54.291 --> 02:24:58.593]  And at that point, the FBI just said, OK, we're not going to deal with it where there is no Middle Eastern connection.
[02:24:58.613 --> 02:25:01.155]  We'll go chase, you know, wild geese someplace else.
[02:25:01.775 --> 02:25:06.358]  Well, we have documents that have surfaced from the Philippine intelligence services
[02:25:07.148 --> 02:25:16.997]  Or Nichols, you know, had gone to the Philippines on several occasions, did not have a job, had no money, yet he was able to fly back and forth to the Philippines, stay in hotels, go to meetings with Abu Sayyaf.
[02:25:17.617 --> 02:25:28.326]  And the documents that surfaced from the Philippines named the names of who he met over there, and one of them was Mohammed Wali Khan, who was tied to Sheikh Khalid Mohammed.
[02:25:28.707 --> 02:25:33.671]  Well, Sheikh Khalid Mohammed, of course, was, you know, one of the right-hand men in Al-Qaeda.
[02:25:34.251 --> 02:25:34.872]  Yes, we are.
[02:25:50.123 --> 02:25:54.385]  Now you talked about this a decade ago, but now more documents have come out.
[02:25:54.405 --> 02:25:55.346]  But people get confused.
[02:25:55.366 --> 02:25:57.727]  You're saying clearly ATF involved.
[02:25:58.007 --> 02:25:58.908]  You've got McVeigh now.
[02:25:58.948 --> 02:26:04.210]  They've got sworn affidavits from Nichols and others that he was sheep-dipped out of special operations.
[02:26:04.831 --> 02:26:06.291]  You've got German intelligence there.
[02:26:06.331 --> 02:26:09.293]  You've got Jane Graham seeing McVeigh in the building, the grey sticks of butter.
[02:26:09.553 --> 02:26:17.117]  This is a classic criminal network operation because that's what Clinton would hire would be a group so that it's so confused
[02:26:17.577 --> 02:26:20.939]  Just like with Kennedy, nobody can understand how it was run.
[02:26:20.999 --> 02:26:22.479]  Is that where this is going?
[02:26:22.499 --> 02:26:25.581]  Yeah, pretty much.
[02:26:25.661 --> 02:26:27.982]  Now we have documents that name
[02:26:28.738 --> 02:26:33.904]  And pretty much date Nichols in the Philippines meeting with members of Al Qaeda.
[02:26:34.464 --> 02:26:43.433]  And it goes all the way to a guy, then we called Osama Bin Laden with a U, which is his actual real name, and they changed it to Osama sometime later on.
[02:26:43.894 --> 02:26:46.677]  In fact, I even mentioned him in a Medusa file back before 9-11.
[02:26:48.979 --> 02:26:52.422]  No one ever acted like they ever heard of this guy before, but we stumbled on to him.
[02:26:52.782 --> 02:26:55.505]  But anyway, we've got those documents showing there's a definite Middle Eastern connection.
[02:26:55.545 --> 02:26:56.325]  It goes to where?
[02:26:56.526 --> 02:26:57.246]  Pakistan!
[02:26:57.727 --> 02:27:08.216]  And it goes to the area between the Pakistan border and the Afghan border, and then across the border into the terrorist training camps that were originally set up by the CIA to train the Mujahideen to fight the Russians.
[02:27:09.156 --> 02:27:12.980]  And we've got all of this evidence, plus we've got the names of Americans that are involved.
[02:27:14.233 --> 02:27:17.354]  Uh, that ran a travel service to the Philippines out of Scottsdale, Arizona.
[02:27:17.895 --> 02:27:23.697]  And all of this was, you know, a lot of this went to Jayna Davis, and Jayna took it to the U.S.
[02:27:23.777 --> 02:27:25.138]  Attorney, took it to the FBI.
[02:27:25.558 --> 02:27:26.558]  They didn't want to see it.
[02:27:27.039 --> 02:27:27.939]  They didn't want to touch it.
[02:27:28.759 --> 02:27:30.180]  Craig, we're almost out of time.
[02:27:30.220 --> 02:27:35.522]  From your deep research of this, best we can tell, who was running the operation?
[02:27:35.542 --> 02:27:36.983]  How were the different players involved?
[02:27:37.748 --> 02:27:43.432]  Well, you know, it's hard to put your finger on who exactly pushed the green button that said, make it go.
[02:27:43.833 --> 02:27:46.895]  But we know who was covering up the operation, and that tells us a lot.
[02:27:46.915 --> 02:27:50.738]  You've got the entire Clinton regime that covered up the actual leads to the Oklahoma City bombing.
[02:27:50.778 --> 02:27:59.185]  You had special agents of the FBI out of New York, I think it was, that came in and refused to investigate the actual leads that we came up with.
[02:27:59.205 --> 02:28:02.127]  The head of counterterrorism was there the night before and got caught lying about it.
[02:28:02.267 --> 02:28:06.549]  Well, and we've had them change reports, change witness statements, intimidate witnesses.
[02:28:06.629 --> 02:28:08.350]  Terrence Yankee, of course, he ended up dead.
[02:28:09.051 --> 02:28:12.813]  Several other people ended up dead that saw things they shouldn't have seen that talked about it.
[02:28:13.273 --> 02:28:16.935]  Jane Graham, who saw Andrew Strassmeyer in the basement of the Murrah Building.
[02:28:16.955 --> 02:28:23.499]  We've got all of these things, but you can't get anybody to do anything about it, because that tells you if you do do something about it, it's going to lead someplace.
[02:28:24.519 --> 02:28:32.702]  What does that mean when you've got Muslim extremists, terrorists, you've got German intelligence, you've got McVeigh running around, you've got the ATF running around?
[02:28:32.723 --> 02:28:34.023]  I mean, it's incredible.
[02:28:34.463 --> 02:28:35.624]  Yeah.
[02:28:35.644 --> 02:28:37.504]  And, you know, it's a soup sandwich.
[02:28:38.425 --> 02:28:48.949]  And the thing about this, when you do come up with good leads, and you've got the federal government who refuses to address those leads, who doesn't want to see it, doesn't want to touch it, that tells me everything I need to know.
[02:28:49.449 --> 02:28:53.571]  You know, if I'm going to arrest a guy and I can't get the prosecutor to go along with it, I'm powerless.
[02:28:55.089 --> 02:28:55.689]  Incredible.
[02:28:56.970 --> 02:29:12.399]  And of course you know about the case where lawyers have been getting different FBI documents where one set's blacked out in one area, the other in the other, and they're able to put them together and find out that the Southern Poverty Law Center was basically running Elohim City.
[02:29:12.941 --> 02:29:16.944]  Oh yeah, Andrew Strathsmire was reporting straight to the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[02:29:16.984 --> 02:29:20.987]  I mean, those people are the ones that derailed the investigation.
[02:29:21.187 --> 02:29:29.974]  They actually had the whole thing twist away from the Middle Eastern connections and the actual, what the witnesses actually saw, you know, at the scene.
[02:29:30.354 --> 02:29:32.816]  And they twisted it all around to where it was all L.O.M.C.D.
[02:29:33.136 --> 02:29:38.460]  and bank robbers and yadda yadda, which was a false flag, false front, false lead from the very beginning.
[02:29:38.780 --> 02:29:41.403]  All right, Colonel Roberts, look forward to having you back soon.
[02:29:41.443 --> 02:29:42.644]  God bless you, my friend.
[02:29:43.005 --> 02:29:43.926]  Ron Paul's coming up.
[02:29:44.226 --> 02:29:45.267]  Colonel, we'll talk to you soon.
[02:29:45.287 --> 02:29:45.968]  Have a great week.
[02:29:45.988 --> 02:29:47.369]  Keep your bandit sharp.
[02:29:47.930 --> 02:29:48.390]  All right, buddy.
[02:29:48.430 --> 02:29:49.271]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:50.352 --> 02:29:51.253]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.754 --> 02:29:53.336]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.277 --> 02:29:56.939]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.089 --> 02:30:02.591]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:30:02.811 --> 02:30:07.836]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:30:08.116 --> 02:30:09.478]  Saving means to make money.
[02:30:09.658 --> 02:30:18.447]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:30:19.168 --> 02:30:26.273]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:30:26.713 --> 02:30:34.318]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:30:34.718 --> 02:30:39.641]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[02:30:39.941 --> 02:30:42.102]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[02:31:00.911 --> 02:31:04.514]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:31:04.934 --> 02:31:07.936]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:31:08.176 --> 02:31:12.940]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:31:12.960 --> 02:31:16.763]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress.
[02:31:17.483 --> 02:31:19.165]  And they really are calling the shots.
[02:31:19.345 --> 02:31:24.890]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:31:24.910 --> 02:31:34.539]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:31:34.659 --> 02:31:36.760]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:38.321]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:31:38.601 --> 02:31:40.862]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:31:41.042 --> 02:31:42.883]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:31:43.164 --> 02:31:47.946]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:31:48.326 --> 02:31:53.089]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[02:32:00.871 --> 02:32:09.376]  The folks at eFoodsDirect have saved you from the huge price increases on food by buying raw materials ahead and packing your supplies themselves.
[02:32:09.876 --> 02:32:13.938]  They haven't increased their prices on great long-term food reserves since last year.
[02:32:14.318 --> 02:32:19.501]  With the rising cost of raw materials and gas prices, they can't hold off any longer.
[02:32:20.181 --> 02:32:28.185]  As of July 1st, Ifu's Direct is forced to increase their prices so they can still ship you the best storable food on the planet.

[02:33:01.445 --> 02:33:07.019]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[02:33:07.480 --> 02:33:10.026]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:15.302 --> 02:33:33.556]  Well, we've got Congressman Ron Paul for the next 20 minutes, and I know he's the hardest working person in Congress, and I feel a little guilty taking his time up, but he's got so much important information, and I know our audience is always chomping at the bit whenever he joins us, normally every month, but now every couple months because he's so busy.
[02:33:34.537 --> 02:33:37.479]  And I've got a whole cornucopia of things to cover here.
[02:33:37.519 --> 02:33:43.603]  The wars, the constitutional crisis, the TSA, the dirty tricks the media's been running on Ron Paul.
[02:33:44.183 --> 02:33:48.806]  And he's a good sportsman so he never really talks about it, but I think it needs to be discussed.
[02:33:48.846 --> 02:33:50.547]  But obviously he's a presidential candidate.
[02:33:51.187 --> 02:33:57.591]  He's the only candidate that is a constitutionalist and that has the solutions to help get this country on the right track.
[02:33:58.172 --> 02:34:04.476]  All the others are rhinos or globalists or neocons and we've got to get behind Ron Paul.
[02:34:04.776 --> 02:34:08.658]  But thank God he ran for president because by running he's injecting real issues.
[02:34:08.958 --> 02:34:11.020]  We've got him for the next 20 minutes and then he's gone.
[02:34:11.960 --> 02:34:17.844]  Sir, there's so much to cover but the Financial Times says the dollar is seen losing global reserve status.
[02:34:18.324 --> 02:34:18.965]  The bankers are...
[02:34:19.445 --> 02:34:20.005]  We're good to go.
[02:34:34.889 --> 02:34:36.649]  Well, I think it's sick and getting thicker.
[02:34:36.669 --> 02:34:38.810]  I did read one article you probably saw today.
[02:34:38.830 --> 02:34:46.791]  They said that the dollar, the reserve standard, as the reserve standard of the world, will be coming to an end, and they added within 25 years.
[02:34:46.811 --> 02:34:51.032]  I would suggest that it's going to come much sooner.
[02:34:51.052 --> 02:34:56.953]  I just don't believe it'll last for 25 years where it'll be the dominant reserve currency of the world.
[02:34:57.393 --> 02:35:00.194]  The big problem, though, is who's going to pick up the pieces?
[02:35:01.014 --> 02:35:01.374]  I think so.
[02:35:21.301 --> 02:35:26.465]  I would say that it's not going to be 25 years, but I don't know, you know, nobody knows exactly the date.
[02:35:26.505 --> 02:35:28.427]  But it could come sooner, a lot sooner.
[02:35:28.487 --> 02:35:30.789]  It could come a year or two or who knows when.
[02:35:30.829 --> 02:35:33.131]  Depends on what event might arise.
[02:35:33.171 --> 02:35:38.736]  But the problem they face is the one that we face in trying to figure it out.
[02:35:39.276 --> 02:35:52.260]  If the dollar is a terrible currency, but when you compare it to the Euro that has to bail out the Greek economy, you know, all of a sudden people look to us because traditionally we've been so strong economically and militarily.
[02:35:52.300 --> 02:35:57.062]  They say, well, at least we can park our money in Treasury bills, you know, for another month or two or three.
[02:35:58.082 --> 02:36:01.144]  Someday, they're going to run out of this momentably against the dollar.
[02:36:01.864 --> 02:36:08.687]  And not too many years ago, the dollar got in big trouble, and we had to go begging to the IMF, and that was in 79 and 80.
[02:36:09.767 --> 02:36:11.628]  People thought it would be that lose control.
[02:36:12.208 --> 02:36:27.075]  But the time is coming, and that will be a much bigger event than we've just experienced, you know, from 08 up until now, and the current crisis that we're in the middle of, because I think it'll just drive us that much deeper into an economic crisis.
[02:36:27.796 --> 02:36:32.858]  Well, the Chinese, as you know, just two weeks ago said the United States is already technically defaulted.
[02:36:33.198 --> 02:36:35.719]  The Federal Reserve is buying most of the T-bills.
[02:36:36.379 --> 02:36:39.000]  And for the average layman out there, they're like, why does that concern me?
[02:36:39.040 --> 02:36:41.901]  Well, that's the faith and credit of the United States.
[02:36:41.921 --> 02:36:50.724]  And that's a tactic I've seen where they'll say 10 years, 25, on something that's going to happen to introduce the idea to you so you accept it but don't panic.
[02:36:51.244 --> 02:37:03.473]  A lot of the experts I read and who've been accurate in the past, they say two, three years, but then they point out it's a global concerted devaluation, so it's not even that the dollar is going to lose its reserve, it's just going to lose its value.
[02:37:04.033 --> 02:37:12.460]  That's right, and you know, they're trying to frighten the members of Congress into, you know, voting to raise the debt limit like they did about the bailout.
[02:37:12.480 --> 02:37:13.961]  You know, the end of the world will come.
[02:37:14.601 --> 02:37:15.642]  There will be a default.
[02:37:16.002 --> 02:37:19.323]  But the default is... I mean, our country is known for default.
[02:37:19.403 --> 02:37:24.286]  I mean, all the way back to the Civil War period, they defaulted on promising to pay gold.
[02:37:24.686 --> 02:37:26.566]  We did it in the 30s with Roosevelt.
[02:37:26.887 --> 02:37:29.508]  Then we did it to all foreigners in 1971.
[02:37:29.588 --> 02:37:35.670]  We just say, well, no, yes, we promised you an ounce of gold for $35, but we're not going to do it anymore.
[02:37:35.690 --> 02:37:41.773]  And even now, they keep saying, well, you have to raise it because we don't want to default on the debt.
[02:37:42.768 --> 02:37:53.454]  If prices are going up for the average person, which they are, and they're probably going up five to ten percent at least at the minimum, somebody's defaulting constantly.
[02:37:53.514 --> 02:37:56.596]  That means they're losing ten-tenths on the dollar every year.
[02:37:57.157 --> 02:37:58.217]  It'll get much worse.
[02:37:58.237 --> 02:37:59.458]  So that is the default.
[02:37:59.818 --> 02:38:00.919]  But that's the deception.
[02:38:00.939 --> 02:38:04.621]  Matter of fact, it's deliberate policy, because they know what we know.
[02:38:04.641 --> 02:38:06.202]  They know that debt can't be paid.
[02:38:06.222 --> 02:38:09.244]  There's no way they can meet their, there's not enough people working.
[02:38:10.905 --> 02:38:16.791]  But the private central banks, they get first use on the money, and so they're more than happy.
[02:38:16.811 --> 02:38:28.462]  And as we get more bankrupt, they're going to be there, loaning us whatever the new currency system is in the future, so they come out on top with their new vaunted bank of the world that George Soros says is going to save us.
[02:38:28.982 --> 02:38:46.110]  Yeah, and they pay 0% interest on it, and then they buy some of this government debt and do these kinds of things, and they make 2%, 3%, 4%, but, you know, if you're retired and think you have this obligation to take care of yourself and say, well, I'm going to have a CD because I can't trust, you know, the stocks or anything else.
[02:38:46.770 --> 02:38:52.572]  They get cheated because they make essentially nothing on their savings, and then they have to pay taxes on it.
[02:38:52.893 --> 02:38:55.914]  Then they wonder why the people don't take better care of themselves, you know?
[02:38:56.394 --> 02:38:58.255]  But it's a deeply flawed system.
[02:38:58.295 --> 02:39:03.977]  It's a deeply flawed system of money and the welfareism and central economic planning through the Federal Reserve.
[02:39:04.437 --> 02:39:12.620]  It's all deeply flawed, and though many of us have talked about this for many, many years, it's coming to fruition, and most people are realizing it.
[02:39:12.921 --> 02:39:13.781]  It's also the reason
[02:39:14.341 --> 02:39:31.057]  And especially the young people are realizing how much they're being dumped on, and I know you reach a lot of young people as well, talking to how they're getting ripped off, because there's no way, even if they could get a good job, they can't pay off these obligations, but they're not getting any good jobs.
[02:39:31.538 --> 02:39:37.844]  So we are really, really facing a major problem, and it has to be a dollar a share is coming in our future.
[02:39:38.137 --> 02:39:42.799]  Well, what about Bernanke last week saying he's puzzled that the economy isn't getting better?
[02:39:43.220 --> 02:39:48.662]  You, with total precision, have predicted exactly what would happen, because it's sound laws of economics.
[02:39:49.543 --> 02:39:54.645]  Bernanke knows full well, as you just said, they know what they're doing, and telling us we're not in a recession.
[02:39:54.685 --> 02:39:56.166]  I mean, that's another lie.
[02:39:56.206 --> 02:40:00.528]  Congressman, shifting gears into the campaign, you are the only candidate...
[02:40:02.449 --> 02:40:04.491]  Decades ago, telling the truth about issues.
[02:40:04.651 --> 02:40:14.540]  Now in the presidential race, the only one who's telling the truth and who has the track record to be trusted, Mitt Romney, you know, helped write what became Obamacare, the rest of them.
[02:40:14.600 --> 02:40:20.306]  I mean, this is a pack of people who are just completely unqualified at this point.
[02:40:20.966 --> 02:40:31.012]  We've got CNN ignoring their own polls and running internet polls with 54 people and then showing you for zero when their own polls show that you won.
[02:40:31.292 --> 02:40:32.673]  You're winning most of the straw polls.
[02:40:32.733 --> 02:40:33.674]  Second, New Hampshire.
[02:40:33.694 --> 02:40:37.336]  I hear Mainline Conservative Radio talking about Republican candidates.
[02:40:37.376 --> 02:40:42.799]  They won't even mention you, despite the fact that you're right there in the top three candidates.
[02:40:43.400 --> 02:40:45.321]  That shows that the system is scared of you.
[02:40:45.381 --> 02:40:50.024]  What can you say to the dirty tricks that they've been trying to pull on you?
[02:40:50.894 --> 02:40:52.335]  I don't think you could stop them.
[02:40:52.435 --> 02:40:58.220]  I mean, they have too much power and control because they own the media and they own a lot of these outlets.
[02:40:58.881 --> 02:41:04.245]  So, talking to people like you, it will get the truth out, but also the internet is a good way to do this.
[02:41:04.725 --> 02:41:09.109]  But, as bad as the system is, it still operates reasonably well.
[02:41:09.129 --> 02:41:20.258]  That is that, you know, over the years I've been able to run for Congress and get elected, and now I am still able to compete, even up against these odds and these tricks.
[02:41:20.738 --> 02:41:24.341]  Because, you know, we can get in and organize, and our numbers are growing.
[02:41:24.401 --> 02:41:32.247]  We're able to raise the money that is necessary, and we continue to do that as long as we keep adding volunteers and able to raise the money.
[02:41:32.627 --> 02:41:45.117]  We are going to compete, but obviously it is more difficult because there's still a large number of people, if not even the majority, get their information from the evening news, the ordinary news, and from their politicians.
[02:41:46.017 --> 02:41:49.178]  If they can discredit you, you don't get credibility.
[02:41:49.218 --> 02:41:57.742]  And last go-around, you know, the first two major debates, one right before Iowa and one before New Hampshire, you know, they excluded me from the debate.
[02:41:57.762 --> 02:42:01.023]  This year, they're not going to be able to do it.
[02:42:01.523 --> 02:42:12.568]  So we have made progress, and that's been because there's a growing number of people who are onto their tracks and are watching them rather closely, and they're going to hear from the supporters if they start doing that.
[02:42:13.888 --> 02:42:19.573]  In spite of the obstacles, our job is to keep doing what we're doing and just gain supporters.
[02:42:20.213 --> 02:42:26.478]  Well, I want to talk about some of the things on the positive front, and specifically the websites and how people need to get involved now.
[02:42:26.538 --> 02:42:31.302]  But you, at the start of the race last time, weren't even in the top ten, then you were in the top four or five.
[02:42:31.923 --> 02:42:34.264]  Now, out of the gates, you're winning most of the straw polls.
[02:42:34.305 --> 02:42:36.626]  You've won the big, coveted CPAC two years in a row.
[02:42:36.947 --> 02:42:39.509]  So Fox cuts to a year-old clip of you being booed.
[02:42:40.109 --> 02:42:41.290]  I mean, all sorts of tricks.
[02:42:41.310 --> 02:42:45.773]  I mean, it is showing that they're scared of you, showing you are viable.
[02:42:46.874 --> 02:42:53.878]  The new talking point is you're not viable, that you're fighting for credibility, which, again, is just a pure hoax.
[02:42:54.419 --> 02:42:58.181]  If you just look at the polls and the numbers, they are horrified of you.
[02:42:58.581 --> 02:43:04.305]  And we have Jim Tucker and others that have given us sterling intel from inside Bilderberg the last five years running.
[02:43:04.806 --> 02:43:06.287]  You are discussed every year.
[02:43:06.647 --> 02:43:10.009]  And they say even if Ron Paul doesn't win, it's the third rail
[02:43:10.009 --> 02:43:14.914]  You're still in colleges now, not liberalism or fake conservatism, but true freedom.
[02:43:16.556 --> 02:43:22.502]  You're in the debates, you're exposing the imperial presidency, you're exposing the dollar devaluation.
[02:43:23.343 --> 02:43:27.727]  They are like vampires to a cross, and Ron Paul is the cross.
[02:43:27.948 --> 02:43:28.789]  They are scared of you.
[02:43:29.861 --> 02:43:31.982]  Well, I don't know how scared they are.
[02:43:32.022 --> 02:43:49.413]  I think they do have concern, but, you know, the one place where we think they're revealing that we are sides making progress is they're starting to support some of our positions, whether it's, you know, backing off on some of this warmongering stuff and saying some things about auditing a Fed.
[02:43:49.993 --> 02:44:01.038]  So we're making progress and what they believe is that if they just appeal or neutralize that a little bit and they can get elected, one of them can get elected and support the same policies.
[02:44:01.078 --> 02:44:03.479]  They don't have to follow through with the policies.
[02:44:03.539 --> 02:44:05.960]  So they recognize our views are popular.
[02:44:06.600 --> 02:44:15.928]  But they also know that you can say a lot of things in campaign, and as long as we elect, you know, their particular kind of people, they don't have to fall through on their promises.
[02:44:15.948 --> 02:44:17.089]  Well, that was my next point.
[02:44:17.750 --> 02:44:30.161]  While they're attacking you and, you know, saying that you're weak when you're the opposite, they're all, even mainstream media admits that suddenly the entire Republican field is acting and talking like Ron Paul.
[02:44:30.221 --> 02:44:33.724]  So, when they can't beat you, they try to counterfeit you.
[02:44:34.642 --> 02:44:45.209]  Yeah, they certainly wouldn't say, well, you know, he has a good point there or there, but the rude laughing and the ridicule, I think that's going to go away.
[02:44:45.229 --> 02:44:48.552]  So far it's gone away, and I don't know whether they'll go back to that or not.
[02:44:49.292 --> 02:44:57.518]  So there's reason for us to say there's good reason to keep doing exactly what we're doing and using what is available to us.
[02:44:57.558 --> 02:45:01.381]  You know, which radio shows and which internet programs and
[02:45:01.841 --> 02:45:03.823]  There's just a lot available to us.
[02:45:03.923 --> 02:45:11.349]  It's not like when there were just three major networks and hardly anybody on talk radio that would, you know, defend our position.
[02:45:11.409 --> 02:45:14.311]  So that's where, you know, I'm optimistic.
[02:45:14.331 --> 02:45:18.074]  But on the short run, there are days when I think about the overwhelming
[02:45:18.963 --> 02:45:29.910]  Well, there's a good chance you're going to become president, but regardless, we've got to supercharge your campaign so you can be at the very forefront the entire time injecting real issues so that as the implosion comes in the future, people will know what you said and our movement for liberty
[02:45:48.723 --> 02:46:00.042]  With you as a focal point, we'll be that much bigger and stronger to offer real solutions, and we'll end up having a President Paul one way or the other, so folks need to have a long-term vision.
[02:46:00.062 --> 02:46:00.663]  Do you agree with that?
[02:46:01.920 --> 02:46:02.460]  Absolutely.
[02:46:02.520 --> 02:46:06.942]  We have to have a long-term plan because nothing happens overnight.
[02:46:08.622 --> 02:46:18.566]  If you'd have asked me five years ago how far along we would be in this effort, I would have not been very optimistic that we could have achieved what we have so far.
[02:46:19.466 --> 02:46:25.431]  Things are moving, but it means that we still have a long way to go, too, and there's lots up for grabs.
[02:46:25.491 --> 02:46:31.515]  And when people lose power, they can get pretty, pretty nasty, because they do not want to give up that power.
[02:46:31.535 --> 02:46:41.222]  And the people who control the money and the system and the appropriations process and the international affairs and all these things, they will not go away quietly.
[02:46:42.043 --> 02:46:46.586]  They will be, you know, pretty determined to cling to their power.
[02:46:46.866 --> 02:46:47.727]  Kicking and screaming.
[02:46:47.827 --> 02:46:50.870]  All right, we've only got four or five minutes left running through these quick questions.
[02:46:51.890 --> 02:46:57.375]  I was surprised to see Congressman Nadler, big Democrat, come out and say Obama is becoming an emperor.
[02:46:58.616 --> 02:47:11.448]  Just as you said weeks ago, the last nail in the Republic's coffin, if Congress lets the President not even consult Congress and say, my authority comes from the UN, quote, I've done this for the legitimacy
[02:47:13.128 --> 02:47:15.989]  I mean, sir, is that not seditious?
[02:47:16.130 --> 02:47:17.230]  Is that not treason?
[02:47:17.330 --> 02:47:22.872]  Is it not impeachable, what President Obama has done with this whole Libya thing?
[02:47:23.552 --> 02:47:25.393]  And now they're getting the ground invasion ready?
[02:47:25.873 --> 02:47:26.373]  Oh, sure.
[02:47:26.393 --> 02:47:30.775]  In a different age, it would have been impeachable and it would have probably followed through.
[02:47:32.037 --> 02:47:39.261]  Up until recent years, they've either gotten permission or token permission, but it's been bad for a while.
[02:47:39.301 --> 02:47:42.363]  Truman certainly did not do anything to notify Congress.
[02:47:42.383 --> 02:47:51.107]  He just marched in under U.N., you know, into Korea, and they got token permission, you know, for Vietnam and these other events.
[02:47:51.147 --> 02:47:57.871]  But once again, Bosnia was no permission, no consultation, and this is the same way in Libya.
[02:47:58.531 --> 02:48:19.249]  But, you know, although the Congress is waking up and there's a pretty good coalition of liberals and conservatives, Republicans and Democrats, coming together and trying to slow this thing up and say the President has no right to do this, at the same time on this DOD budget authorization, you know, they inserted in there an expansion of the power.
[02:48:19.329 --> 02:48:24.093]  Actually, if it's passed by the Senate and put in the law, we've literally legalized,
[02:48:25.794 --> 02:48:26.694]  We're good to go.
[02:48:49.805 --> 02:48:51.326]  Or including our own.
[02:48:51.346 --> 02:49:02.372]  So this to me was one of the most dangerous changes in our law, given legitimacy to our president on what he's been doing.
[02:49:02.432 --> 02:49:10.837]  And of course there's not much resistance either from the Republicans or the Democrats on this, but hopefully we can wake the American people up to that change.
[02:49:11.400 --> 02:49:21.170]  What about Obama admittedly going to have feds pose as people calling doctors to see if they're taking Medicare, Medicaid patients, which is their right to not do, as you know.
[02:49:21.970 --> 02:49:26.515]  This is really freaking doctors out that now the feds are going to be spying, spying on them.
[02:49:28.194 --> 02:49:35.079]  Yes, and I would assume that most people don't realize that's against the law to do those kind of things.
[02:49:35.219 --> 02:49:41.324]  I mean, why should they violate the privacy, you know, of a doctor-patient relationship and come in and fake?
[02:49:41.564 --> 02:49:48.570]  It's fraud, it's deceitful, and what kind of punishment might these doctors, what if the doctors say, I don't take medical care of patients, you know?
[02:49:48.590 --> 02:49:52.293]  Who knows what kind of a list you get put on there.
[02:49:52.973 --> 02:49:58.557]  But, uh, no, that's just, uh, one thing leads to the next, always an unintended consequence.
[02:49:58.657 --> 02:50:02.219]  Every time the government does one thing, they create two or three new problems.
[02:50:03.174 --> 02:50:07.518]  Congressman, just a couple questions left here, and then we're going to ask you how we support the campaign again.
[02:50:08.359 --> 02:50:14.144]  Operation Fast and Furious, just to remind listeners, the head of the ATF caught lying to Congress, saying he didn't know.
[02:50:14.204 --> 02:50:15.685]  Now we have the emails, memorandum.
[02:50:15.705 --> 02:50:25.554]  They were running the Operation Shipguns into Mexico to then claim that we're causing the violence down there, a form of false flag, a staged event to frame the Second Amendment.
[02:50:25.874 --> 02:50:26.875]  He's caught lying.
[02:50:28.436 --> 02:50:37.403]  Can you or others call for congressional hearings and haul these people up and expose what the dreaded ATF has done?
[02:50:37.423 --> 02:50:42.367]  Well, I'm sure that would be legitimate if somebody's so motivated.
[02:50:42.467 --> 02:50:48.051]  I don't happen to be on that particular committee, but yes, government oversight could do that.
[02:50:48.092 --> 02:50:53.216]  They could call up and get to the bottom of it, but I haven't heard a whole lot of talk.
[02:50:53.256 --> 02:50:57.459]  I don't have any special information on that, but they certainly can and they certainly should.
[02:50:58.721 --> 02:51:09.135]  In closing on the political issues, there's new reports out in mainstream television and newspapers that cancer is surging in body scan operators.
[02:51:09.175 --> 02:51:14.061]  The TSA at the Boston airport where it's been for seven years, they've got an internal cover-up.
[02:51:14.722 --> 02:51:29.839]  Uh, of the fact that they know that radiation is leaking out of these, uh, could this be the nail in the coffin of this, this federal TSA that they knowingly, uh, are not following radiation rules or radiology rules that you'd follow it in your practice?
[02:51:31.201 --> 02:51:37.867]  I hope so, but isn't it sad that they have to come to that conclusion after somebody's made sick or get cancer?
[02:51:38.307 --> 02:51:46.855]  But the big thing is we've got to get the government out of that business, so if they get rid of the machines then they're going to do a lot more probing and prodding and poking everybody.
[02:51:47.276 --> 02:51:48.977]  So it's really tragic.
[02:51:49.037 --> 02:51:50.399]  I think what's happening at airports
[02:51:51.079 --> 02:51:52.520]  Is the litmus test.
[02:51:52.620 --> 02:52:06.788]  If the American people can sit back and look at some of those pictures and not be outraged and not demanding changes, when I see that, that's when I have some pessimistic thoughts about what's going to happen in this country.
[02:52:06.808 --> 02:52:14.172]  So let's hope that those pictures will so outrage the people that we'll end up doing something about it.
[02:52:14.452 --> 02:52:18.934]  Speaking of the TSA, I've got sources inside the Perry campaign and at Fox News.
[02:52:19.094 --> 02:52:21.756]  As you know, Rick Perry, the governor, is planning to run.
[02:52:21.796 --> 02:52:23.337]  I would imagine you've got the same intel.
[02:52:23.757 --> 02:52:25.818]  And he's going to run on a Ron Paul platform.
[02:52:26.138 --> 02:52:30.160]  So he's really going to be the guy you face from our analysis.
[02:52:30.741 --> 02:52:33.242]  And Rick Perry quietly tried to kill the good bill.
[02:52:33.522 --> 02:52:38.925]  They've rewritten it where it actually puts in the code that the TSA can do this now.
[02:52:39.905 --> 02:52:43.208]  That's typical.
[02:52:43.708 --> 02:52:53.776]  That's why you can never look what they do on the surface.
[02:52:53.816 --> 02:53:04.063]  When people want something done, they'll pass a bill and it'll do the opposite, whether it was the War Powers Resolution or this recent episode of that bill they tried to pass, which literally legalized the war.
[02:53:04.083 --> 02:53:07.646]  So, yes, that's what they do, and then they claim victory.
[02:53:08.166 --> 02:53:09.346]  What's your view of Perry?
[02:53:09.586 --> 02:53:10.507]  What's your view of Perry?
[02:53:10.847 --> 02:53:15.628]  Well, I've never... I've never... I might have shaken hands with him, but I don't even remember that.
[02:53:15.648 --> 02:53:22.270]  So I've never... I don't know him well personally, but I would think that he and I wouldn't have much in agreement on policies.
[02:53:23.350 --> 02:53:26.071]  Well, he was Al Gore's former campaign manager in Texas.
[02:53:26.191 --> 02:53:31.153]  I don't think that's a very good... That ought to tell a few people something!
[02:53:32.955 --> 02:53:43.061]  Well, Congressman, you seemed really happy, because you're always so focused, because I know you're a very disciplined man, but when I talked to you in the break before you came live, I don't think I've ever heard you so happy.
[02:53:43.781 --> 02:53:49.225]  Am I right in that, I mean, you said, well, I'm sad for the country, but overall I'm happy that folks are starting to wake up.
[02:53:49.245 --> 02:53:50.025]  I mean, you are happy.
[02:53:50.465 --> 02:53:56.549]  Yeah, I am, and things have, personally with family and everything, have been, has been going pretty well.
[02:53:57.309 --> 02:54:00.411]  And that's what I guess cheers me up.
[02:54:01.012 --> 02:54:01.772]  Well, thank you, sir.
[02:54:01.832 --> 02:54:07.316]  In closing, what, I mean, because I've got millions of listeners, a lot of new big stations across the country.
[02:54:07.896 --> 02:54:09.578]  We're not talking to just a million every day.
[02:54:09.618 --> 02:54:13.120]  We're talking to three million every day on the radio alone, not just Internet.
[02:54:13.180 --> 02:54:14.961]  Later, we're reaching about 10 million a week.
[02:54:16.002 --> 02:54:18.964]  Talking to the millions of new listeners who've never heard you in a long form.
[02:54:19.244 --> 02:54:21.366]  They've heard you on TV being interrupted constantly.
[02:54:22.067 --> 02:54:28.995]  What can they do to be part of this second American revolution or the restoration of the republic?
[02:54:29.575 --> 02:54:30.957]  Give us the orders from headquarters.
[02:54:31.297 --> 02:54:35.381]  What do we do to supercharge a campaign that's already on fire?
[02:54:36.400 --> 02:54:43.402]  Well, in very general terms, slightly separate from the campaign, what everybody has to do is be informed.
[02:54:43.482 --> 02:54:49.084]  Get the information and find out where the problem is and what the answers are and why philosophy is important.
[02:54:49.164 --> 02:54:51.165]  When they're informed, then they have to do something.
[02:54:51.665 --> 02:54:52.745]  And they can make choices.
[02:54:52.805 --> 02:54:54.325]  They can get involved directly.
[02:54:54.345 --> 02:54:56.786]  They can become candidates or support candidates.
[02:54:56.846 --> 02:54:58.187]  They can get into education.
[02:54:58.227 --> 02:54:59.547]  They can get radio talk shows.
[02:54:59.867 --> 02:55:02.468]  They can get on the internet to promote this message.
[02:55:03.028 --> 02:55:17.123]  But then when it comes more specific for what I've been doing, you know, we had the educational opportunities through my foundation as well as Campaign for Liberty, but right now we are very much engaged in the presidential campaign.
[02:55:17.584 --> 02:55:20.046]  People who are interested in that can go to RonPaul2012.com.
[02:55:22.769 --> 02:55:26.230]  And find out what they can do because that's where we need to help.
[02:55:26.290 --> 02:55:29.392]  We need people to volunteer.
[02:55:29.472 --> 02:55:30.672]  We need to raise money.
[02:55:30.772 --> 02:55:35.974]  And right now, the next big event for us is to try to find people in Iowa.
[02:55:36.094 --> 02:55:42.157]  Anybody knows anybody in Iowa that would be willing to support us and make an effort and come out on August 13th.
[02:55:42.417 --> 02:55:44.097]  That would be very helpful to us.
[02:55:44.177 --> 02:55:45.658]  And when's the next Money Bomb?
[02:55:45.698 --> 02:55:47.519]  And folks can give right now at RonPaul2012.com.
[02:55:48.732 --> 02:56:01.318]  Well, there is an effort right now, because on the 30th of this month, the books close, and you know, there's a big... That report is significant, because it will be blasted all over the country on who raised what.
[02:56:01.998 --> 02:56:14.844]  And we won't be the biggest fundraiser, but we're going to have raised a lot, but they were trying to push for, you know, first for three, then somebody said, maybe we can raise five, and I think it's not quite at four million right now.
[02:56:15.624 --> 02:56:21.289]  The next couple days we're hoping to boost that up and have a good showing for the financial reports of this quarter.
[02:56:22.190 --> 02:56:23.071]  All right, Congressman.
[02:56:23.091 --> 02:56:24.032]  Well, thank you so much.
[02:56:24.052 --> 02:56:25.633]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[02:56:25.673 --> 02:56:26.394]  Thank you so much.
[02:56:26.815 --> 02:56:27.115]  Thank you.

[02:57:29.983 --> 02:57:30.464]  Thank you.

[02:58:34.022 --> 02:58:34.362]  All right.
[02:58:34.402 --> 02:58:35.183]  God bless you all.
[02:58:35.203 --> 02:58:36.484]  See you back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[02:58:36.524 --> 02:58:36.924]  Central.
[02:58:37.304 --> 02:58:40.046]  We're going to do an hour on the internet only at Infowars.com.
[02:58:42.568 --> 02:58:44.409]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:45.970 --> 02:58:48.192]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.107 --> 02:58:52.609]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:58:52.809 --> 02:58:57.856]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:58:58.136 --> 02:58:59.498]  Saving means to make money.
[02:58:59.659 --> 02:59:08.450]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:59:09.171 --> 02:59:16.294]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:59:16.714 --> 02:59:24.317]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:59:24.717 --> 02:59:29.639]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[02:59:29.939 --> 02:59:32.100]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[02:59:40.467 --> 02:59:42.589]  Or see Calvin on the web at 5starsub.com.
[03:00:24.875 --> 03:00:28.057]  Well, we just had Congressman Ron Paul on with us in the last hour.
[03:00:28.117 --> 03:00:32.340]  Now we're still broadcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv and Infowars.com.
[03:00:32.360 --> 03:00:34.842]  The official radio broadcast is over.
[03:00:35.902 --> 03:00:38.424]  But a lot of times we end up going into overdrive, as you know.
[03:00:39.085 --> 03:00:46.389]  I'm going to do a whole hour of overdrive today because I haven't even gotten into the incredible TSA developments in detail here in Texas and what that means.
[03:00:47.370 --> 03:00:49.431]  Dollar seen losing global reserve status.
[03:00:50.412 --> 03:00:54.735]  Louisiana Supreme Court allows vehicle searches on a hunch.
[03:00:56.336 --> 03:00:59.898]  And it continues on from there.
[03:01:00.956 --> 03:01:08.717]  We also have other reports here where Maryland adds environmental literacy in high schools.
[03:01:09.217 --> 03:01:11.158]  That means eugenics, anti-human literacy.
[03:01:11.418 --> 03:01:18.299]  See, they fill it all up with political correctness and gender this, and school is a brainwashing facility to be a globalist.
[03:01:18.679 --> 03:01:25.760]  They don't teach reading, writing, and arithmetic, and that's why we're behind the whole world now, every industrialized nation and many third world nations, by design.
[03:01:25.800 --> 03:01:28.781]  We've interviewed former heads of policy at the Department of Education.
[03:01:29.321 --> 03:01:32.064]  The former head of education in New York, others.
[03:01:32.744 --> 03:01:35.407]  This is the plan, and it's worked.
[03:01:36.208 --> 03:01:36.528]  Okay?
[03:01:36.928 --> 03:01:47.078]  Now, shifting gears for the next 30 minutes, Webster Griffin Tarpley joins us from Tripoli, that's been under three-plus months of bombardment, to give us what's really happening there.
[03:01:48.600 --> 03:01:51.403]  And I will open the phones up in the next segment.
[03:01:51.943 --> 03:01:52.584]  Hi Alex, how are you?
[03:02:12.898 --> 03:02:14.059]  Well, we're hanging on here.
[03:02:15.320 --> 03:02:22.106]  The BBC is hyping some great gains by the rebels a little bit southwest of here.
[03:02:22.346 --> 03:02:24.307]  People here are very skeptical about that.
[03:02:24.327 --> 03:02:32.274]  The BBC has a track record of taking these manic statements by the Benghazi rebel council and putting that on the air.
[03:02:33.055 --> 03:02:39.220]  Rather, there's here, I think, a great deal of confidence by the Libyan government
[03:02:39.838 --> 03:02:47.751]  That the rebellion in the city of Misurata, or Misurata, was in its final throes.
[03:02:47.811 --> 03:02:52.539]  In other words, that it's going to be over there in something like seven to ten days.
[03:02:52.639 --> 03:02:54.222]  And that was an important place.
[03:02:54.972 --> 03:02:57.733]  For the rebels to go into, because that is the steel mill.
[03:02:57.793 --> 03:03:08.878]  That is one of the biggest steel mills in Africa, and it is, as far as I know, capable of manufacturing the biggest steel tubing in the world.
[03:03:08.958 --> 03:03:13.821]  And this has to do with the Qaddafi project, right?
[03:03:13.901 --> 03:03:16.722]  Infrastructure project called the Great Man-Made River.
[03:03:17.362 --> 03:03:28.311]  Which is 32 billion dollars taking the water from under the Sahara Desert and piping that north towards Tripoli, Benghazi, and the other cities.
[03:03:28.371 --> 03:03:34.436]  So that, you know, in Yemen, we're told that within a couple of years there's going to be no water in Yemen.
[03:03:34.496 --> 03:03:43.043]  And the guy that I heard talking about this, the expert, anyways, said that that doesn't mean a shortage of water, but actually no water.
[03:03:43.864 --> 03:03:47.560]  The future of human life in Yemen may be very dubious, but in Libya...
[03:03:48.346 --> 03:04:02.592]  It is assured, at least in the sense of water, and you've got to put in water as one of the main things that these NATO imperialists and... Oh, they've said that's the next thing they're going after globally is the blue gold.
[03:04:02.612 --> 03:04:15.257]  For those that don't know, just, what, 50,000 years ago they know the Sahara was full of lakes and crocodiles and hippopotamus and all of it, and that the water went underground with desertification.
[03:04:16.118 --> 03:04:22.088]  And that it's there and Gaddafi's bringing it up and becoming a spoke for development all over Africa.
[03:04:22.128 --> 03:04:22.929]  That can't be allowed.
[03:04:23.763 --> 03:04:25.844]  Right, so that's the vendetta they have going.
[03:04:25.884 --> 03:04:33.966]  So one of the key parts of that project, instead of just importing the stuff, they said, let's build our steel mill here in Misrata, right on the coast.
[03:04:34.026 --> 03:04:38.268]  You can get the raw materials in, but then we'll manufacture these huge tubes.
[03:04:38.308 --> 03:04:52.412]  So not Mannesmann of Germany, usually the gold standard for steel tubing, not somebody in Japan or in the Far East, but Libya, which had been one of the poorest, if not the poorest, certainly in Africa, maybe the
[03:04:53.113 --> 03:04:58.280]  Stay there Webster, let's break it all down and where this is going and how he's handing out millions of firearms.
[03:04:58.300 --> 03:04:58.761]  Stay with us.
[03:05:00.014 --> 03:05:03.175]  There's a man named Dr. Wallach who is anything but your typical doctor.
[03:05:03.515 --> 03:05:13.939]  Both a veterinarian and naturopathic physician, Doc asks, why does the United States spend more money on health care by far and still rank 50th in health and longevity worldwide?
[03:05:14.299 --> 03:05:23.443]  He believes that people should empower themselves with a basic understanding of nutrition, taking charge of their life, and attain optimal health and longevity through nutrition.
[03:05:23.883 --> 03:05:26.845]  Not by toxic prescription drugs, leading to side effects.
[03:05:27.125 --> 03:05:28.766]  This is clearly a deadly recipe.
[03:05:29.107 --> 03:05:38.373]  The good news is, Doc Wallach's message is resonating with an increasing number of Americans, who are waking up to all the big government and big pharma manipulation of our healthcare system.
[03:05:38.673 --> 03:05:45.977]  I like what Doc Wallach is saying and doing to enlighten people about healthcare, and have joined forces to help this tireless crusader spread his message.
[03:05:46.438 --> 03:05:47.779]  Visit InfoWarsTeam.com
[03:05:48.379 --> 03:05:48.980]  We're good to go.
[03:06:01.337 --> 03:06:04.958]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:06:05.358 --> 03:06:08.359]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:06:08.599 --> 03:06:13.360]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:06:13.380 --> 03:06:19.622]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:06:19.782 --> 03:06:22.023]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[03:06:22.563 --> 03:06:22.843]  Tim Geithner?
[03:06:22.863 --> 03:06:23.283]  Bernanke?
[03:06:23.383 --> 03:06:24.144]  They're arsonists!
[03:06:24.164 --> 03:06:25.304]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:06:25.324 --> 03:06:27.565]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:06:41.471 --> 03:06:43.293]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[03:06:43.313 --> 03:06:48.400]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:06:48.740 --> 03:06:57.852]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:07:00.265 --> 03:07:05.710]  You know that drinking pure, high alkaline water is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[03:07:06.030 --> 03:07:09.834]  And most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.

[03:07:54.907 --> 03:08:07.520]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:08.121 --> 03:08:11.104]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:29.955 --> 03:08:35.480]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're back live with Webster Griffin Tarpley joining us from Tripoli.
[03:08:35.880 --> 03:08:41.245]  We've got some questions from listeners out there, so it's not just old Alex Jones bringing up points.
[03:08:41.505 --> 03:08:45.609]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[03:08:46.490 --> 03:08:52.775]  Webster's leaving us at the bottom of the hour, and I'm going to get into a whole bunch of other news I haven't covered yet and also take some of your calls.
[03:08:53.789 --> 03:08:53.889]  Yes.
[03:09:13.593 --> 03:09:14.414]  Taking him out.
[03:09:14.814 --> 03:09:16.335]  We have a constitutional crisis.
[03:09:16.415 --> 03:09:23.120]  Ron Paul, the congressman, the presidential candidate, agreed with us last hour that this is impeachable offense against Obama.
[03:09:23.840 --> 03:09:30.525]  But the ruling class has gone collectively mad dog with hubris, or is it desperation?
[03:09:31.005 --> 03:09:31.926]  I want your view on that.
[03:09:32.306 --> 03:09:40.072]  Where they are just getting more and more crazy, more and more out in the open, more and more naked, brazen, whatever you want to call it.
[03:09:41.813 --> 03:09:42.774]  Why is this being done?
[03:09:43.715 --> 03:09:51.302]  Well, just on the Obama issue, remember, he's now long past the deadline on the War Powers Act, so that means he is impeachable.
[03:09:51.362 --> 03:09:57.268]  So please add that one to the bill of impeachment, along with a number of other charges.
[03:09:57.828 --> 03:10:04.395]  We just passed 100 days of bombing, and people here have compared this to
[03:10:05.076 --> 03:10:13.629]  The bombing of Serbia back in 1999 went on, I believe, and it is believed here, for 68 or 69 days.
[03:10:13.889 --> 03:10:17.115]  And of course, in that situation, there was no ground war.
[03:10:18.041 --> 03:10:30.828]  So Libya has successfully stood up under 100 days of NATO bombing with the attacks of Al-Qaeda terrorists masquerading as pro-democracy rebels here on the ground.
[03:10:30.928 --> 03:10:36.292]  So Serbs, of course, notoriously tough, but the conclusion is Libyans even tougher.
[03:10:36.352 --> 03:10:41.835]  So if you look at Libya, I think this is the last place in the world anybody would want
[03:10:42.555 --> 03:10:43.656]  We're good to go.
[03:11:05.748 --> 03:11:08.569]  Approximately one million casualties.
[03:11:09.569 --> 03:11:14.711]  Unbelievable excesses of the Italian imperialists at that time.
[03:11:14.991 --> 03:11:19.113]  So what it shows you is that there's no limit to this resistance.
[03:11:19.193 --> 03:11:22.014]  And the cohesion of it, of course, coming from the tribes.
[03:11:22.034 --> 03:11:31.818]  This included standing up against an electrified fence and minefield that went over just about the, well, if not the whole length of the border between Libya and Egypt.
[03:11:32.618 --> 03:11:33.259]  But a lot of it.
[03:11:33.299 --> 03:11:34.520]  So that's one thing.
[03:11:34.800 --> 03:11:49.793]  In terms of the insanity of the ruling class, I have to point out the International Criminal Court, so-called, and this guy Ocampo, this scoundrel, this faker who has organized that thing into a kangaroo court internationally.
[03:11:50.013 --> 03:11:57.160]  We're still waiting for the indictment of Bush, of Rumsfeld, of Cheney, of Wolfowitz, all the neocons who
[03:11:57.840 --> 03:11:59.301]  We're good to go.
[03:12:23.978 --> 03:12:28.971]  This place is, it's a murder incorporated in its own right, that you get Milosevic there and then...
[03:12:29.804 --> 03:12:33.385]  He mysteriously dies of an unexpected heart attack.
[03:12:33.525 --> 03:12:36.526]  Yeah, they gave him anteater poison.
[03:12:37.086 --> 03:12:37.746]  Something like this.
[03:12:38.227 --> 03:12:54.692]  So they've put out an indictment of Colonel Gaddafi, his son Saif, that is the surviving son Saif, because the other one was killed with the same name, but Saif al-Arab, Saif al-Islam, the surviving one, is the
[03:12:56.758 --> 03:13:06.247]  It is also indicted, and a guy called Sanusi, who's the security chief, and this has got all of these accusations.
[03:13:06.267 --> 03:13:11.131]  The stuff that this is based on is complete fabrication and complete hearsay.
[03:13:11.892 --> 03:13:18.298]  What happened in the middle of February, February 12th, 13th, 14th, was that you had mobs of
[03:13:20.291 --> 03:13:37.279]  Rebels, right, under Al-Qaeda leadership, storming military bases and arms depots, especially in the Benghazi area, with the goal of starting off not armed, but to get armed as soon as they could, with the various, you know, machine guns,
[03:13:37.999 --> 03:13:38.339]  Thank you.
[03:13:53.852 --> 03:13:54.753]  I don't think so.
[03:14:14.213 --> 03:14:15.134]  We're good to go.
[03:14:32.015 --> 03:14:32.796]  Ridiculousness.
[03:14:32.916 --> 03:14:51.934]  I have here a well-informed Middle East source who says that Ocampo should stop talking about rape because he is alleged to have indulged in this himself, and that somehow the International Criminal Court did some dirty things to get him off the hook on some of those charges.
[03:14:51.974 --> 03:14:54.537]  So this man is an adventurer and a fraud.
[03:14:56.898 --> 03:15:00.640]  That is the new thing that has happened here today.
[03:15:00.660 --> 03:15:06.783]  It's a kangaroo court of hypocrites, and I guess we have to be thankful that the U.S.
[03:15:06.863 --> 03:15:07.643]  is not in it.
[03:15:07.683 --> 03:15:10.985]  That's some little mercy in this whole terrible situation.
[03:15:11.485 --> 03:15:14.927]  The thing about the insanity of the ruling class is, of course, that.
[03:15:14.947 --> 03:15:21.930]  When you have a ruling elite that's based on derivatives and other kinds of finances, and when they see these
[03:15:23.234 --> 03:15:27.316]  Castles of cards that they've built come crashing down before their eyes.
[03:15:27.376 --> 03:15:30.178]  They go collectively insane and they lash out.
[03:15:30.218 --> 03:15:31.339]  Let me just give you an example.
[03:15:31.819 --> 03:15:37.242]  In September 21st, 1931, you had the bankruptcy of the British Pound.
[03:15:37.662 --> 03:15:44.646]  The central event of the last depression was the bankruptcy of the Pound in September 1931 when the Bank of England ceased gold payment.
[03:15:45.627 --> 03:15:54.034]  And within about a week of that, I think a couple of days before, you have the Japanese setting off this provocation so they can invade Manchuria.
[03:15:54.435 --> 03:16:08.668]  So the idea that when you see a really acute economic depression taking shape, this is often immediately accompanied by most insane military adventurism of the type that we see here.
[03:16:11.124 --> 03:16:14.645]  Well, Webster, my issue is this.
[03:16:14.946 --> 03:16:18.287]  I mean, obviously, George Washington said don't get involved in foreign entanglements.
[03:16:18.907 --> 03:16:24.389]  But then Thomas Jefferson, my big hero, you know, when our ships are being attacked, then you go and defend them.
[03:16:24.429 --> 03:16:25.850]  But that's when you're attacked.
[03:16:25.910 --> 03:16:35.354]  And, of course, that happened, as you know, in the Mediterranean and other areas dealing and in the Gulf dealing with Arab pirates.
[03:16:35.994 --> 03:16:37.895]  But Qaddafi's not attacking us.
[03:16:37.935 --> 03:16:39.115]  He tried to work with the West.
[03:16:39.155 --> 03:16:39.816]  He's been cheated.
[03:16:41.076 --> 03:16:47.764]  They have had generals in Congress, as you know, two days ago say, yes, we're getting ready for a ground invasion, but it's going to be humanitarian.
[03:16:48.145 --> 03:16:56.374]  I've confirmed it from first a letter I got from Fort Hood, then we put out feelers to our sources over the telephone, then callers that it was happening.
[03:16:56.414 --> 03:16:59.017]  Now it's pretty much admitted, and it's the very groups we were told.
[03:17:00.419 --> 03:17:01.859]  They've been told they are going in.
[03:17:01.899 --> 03:17:20.824]  Now that could be stopped, but talking to all the military statisticians, talking to military affairs reporter, previously before he did national security, Wayne Madsen, who just returned from Libya, he's been there before, Qaddafi has bought, especially from the British, incredibly high-tech weapons.
[03:17:20.864 --> 03:17:21.624]  He's just waiting
[03:17:22.404 --> 03:17:25.665]  And he's begging for the world to stop this naked aggression.
[03:17:26.185 --> 03:17:27.085]  But when the U.S.
[03:17:27.105 --> 03:17:33.206]  troops go in there, it's probably, many are estimating, going to be worse than Iraq.
[03:17:33.967 --> 03:17:40.248]  Dealing with these six million people armed with grenade launchers, RPGs, and that's just the citizens.
[03:17:40.288 --> 03:17:47.930]  Qaddafi reportedly has very nasty anti-tank weapons that he bought from France and England and the Russians as well.
[03:17:48.270 --> 03:17:49.370]  Some of the latest stuff.
[03:17:49.850 --> 03:17:55.735]  And these are small, that one man can carry, that are reportedly D.U.
[03:17:55.795 --> 03:17:56.155]  tips.
[03:17:56.215 --> 03:17:59.418]  So they're not going to be fighting just Iraqis with AK-47s.
[03:18:00.579 --> 03:18:17.834]  And even if they try to go door-to-door, kicking in doors to confiscate the guns, house-to-house, if 1% of the 6 million population fights back, that's hundreds of thousands of combatants, this could make Iwo Jima and places like that look like a picnic.
[03:18:18.914 --> 03:18:30.156]  It's an act of incalculable folly if they do it, and above all, the really terrible thing about it is, out of all the places in the Middle East, this is a population that wants economic development.
[03:18:30.696 --> 03:18:35.797]  They're not interested in, you know, the more benighted forms of Islamic fundamentalism.
[03:18:35.817 --> 03:18:37.657]  It's a secular state.
[03:18:38.598 --> 03:18:40.938]  It's based on economic development.
[03:18:41.058 --> 03:18:46.819]  They have this political system, which they will describe as the equivalent of a New England town meeting.
[03:18:47.139 --> 03:18:48.600]  And the globalists hate that.
[03:18:48.940 --> 03:18:52.322]  Every time they get in charge, they do put the Muslim extremists in.
[03:18:52.662 --> 03:18:54.363]  I mean, look at what they do in every country.
[03:18:54.403 --> 03:18:55.123]  This is incredible.
[03:18:56.304 --> 03:19:02.867]  And again, I think I told you, the Roman Catholic Bishop is concerned about what might happen to the Catholics here.
[03:19:02.887 --> 03:19:15.734]  There are a lot of Filipino guest workers, a lot of them are Catholic, so there's a lot of social services from the Bishop of Tripoli, Giovanni Martinelli, and he's concerned about the Islamic fundamentalists coming in here.
[03:19:16.935 --> 03:19:20.438]  What you'll hear from the Libyan government, I think, is very important for people to bear in mind.
[03:19:20.819 --> 03:19:27.145]  There is an alliance between the CIA and the Muslim Brotherhood, and the Muslim Brotherhood are the benighted ones.
[03:19:27.245 --> 03:19:31.869]  Those are the backward opponents of modern civilization.
[03:19:32.630 --> 03:19:37.095]  In the Middle East in general, according to people that I've talked to here, various
[03:19:46.222 --> 03:19:46.623]  Stay there.
[03:19:46.663 --> 03:19:50.386]  Yeah, let's break down the factions from Tripoli with Webster Griffin Tarbley.
[03:19:50.726 --> 03:19:52.067]  Drudge is top-linked.
[03:19:52.087 --> 03:19:58.112]  We appreciate him doing that to our story about the radiation cover-up with the TSA.
[03:20:00.895 --> 03:20:06.542]  GCN listeners, why have you been hearing so much about Dermatol, the all-natural, all-purpose first aid spray?
[03:20:06.722 --> 03:20:10.567]  Because it's the must-have first aid product you need in your preparedness kit.
[03:20:10.847 --> 03:20:19.558]  Dermatol is made in America by Americans who know there's a more affordable, natural way to treat cuts, burns, bites, rashes, shingles, boils, and many other skin problems.
[03:20:19.798 --> 03:20:25.164]  Dermatol is gentle enough for diaper rash, powerful enough for bed sores, and harmless to the eyes and mouth.
[03:20:25.364 --> 03:20:27.867]  It's great for the whole family, even your family pets!
[03:20:28.087 --> 03:20:34.435]  Dermatol is antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, and not diminished by freezing, extreme heat, or years in storage.
[03:20:34.735 --> 03:20:38.196]  Dermatol is an absolute must for any first aid or preparedness kit.
[03:20:38.416 --> 03:20:42.977]  Dermatol's soothing, rapid restoration of injured skin is so effective, it's guaranteed.

[03:20:59.775 --> 03:21:03.998]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:21:04.318 --> 03:21:04.918]  Number 1.
[03:21:05.239 --> 03:21:08.381]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:21:08.641 --> 03:21:09.201]  Number 2.
[03:21:09.502 --> 03:21:14.065]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:21:14.405 --> 03:21:14.845]  It's true.
[03:21:15.145 --> 03:21:19.708]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:21:20.029 --> 03:21:20.549]  Number 3.
[03:21:20.849 --> 03:21:24.131]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:21:24.431 --> 03:21:28.114]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:21:28.334 --> 03:21:28.875]  Number 4.
[03:21:29.115 --> 03:21:31.497]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:21:31.897 --> 03:21:35.280]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:21:35.580 --> 03:21:35.781]  Number 5.
[03:21:36.361 --> 03:21:40.284]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:21:40.505 --> 03:21:45.269]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[03:22:06.307 --> 03:22:06.887]  That's $15,4153, $770.76, and $385.38.
[03:22:19.637 --> 03:22:22.638]  The Constitution and the Bill of Rights have been reduced to old relics.
[03:22:22.718 --> 03:22:26.260]  Politicians ignore, trample with their outlandish, overreaching policies.
[03:22:26.440 --> 03:22:30.341]  Your support for the Campaign for Liberty stands in the way of this insidious process.
[03:22:30.721 --> 03:22:31.822]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[03:24:03.056 --> 03:24:12.404]  Yeah, the Drudge Report, DrudgeReport.com is linked in the middle corner in red.
[03:24:28.769 --> 03:24:32.351]  Cancer surges and TSA body scanner operations.
[03:24:32.411 --> 03:24:33.232]  Get that article.
[03:24:33.872 --> 03:24:35.793]  Get it out to everybody, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:24:35.853 --> 03:24:36.894]  This is important.
[03:24:36.934 --> 03:24:41.877]  This is one of the biggest blows against their power grab ever.
[03:24:42.437 --> 03:24:46.019]  That they've been covering up the level of radiation and covering up the cancer clusters.
[03:24:46.599 --> 03:24:52.783]  And we've got links in the article to the PDFs with the internal TSA people hopping mad about this.
[03:24:53.363 --> 03:24:57.506]  This is where they've had them going back to late 2002, so seven and a half, eight years.
[03:24:58.226 --> 03:24:59.327]  That's, gosh, eight years.
[03:24:59.387 --> 03:25:00.227]  Time just flies.
[03:25:01.708 --> 03:25:03.649]  And this is huge news.
[03:25:03.669 --> 03:25:05.630]  This really shows how evil this government is.
[03:25:06.431 --> 03:25:23.460]  And now it's turning out that Pistole is lying about them not telling her to take the diaper off, playing these word games of, well, we said you can't fly if you don't take the diaper off and let us check it, but we didn't say take the diaper off.
[03:25:24.643 --> 03:25:28.810]  All these word games, twisting the meanings, playing games.
[03:25:31.894 --> 03:25:32.515]  Just incredible.
[03:25:32.555 --> 03:25:33.937]  Meanwhile, they're throwing the book at people.
[03:25:34.298 --> 03:25:39.665]  Army vet in jail after marking wrong box on passenger application.
[03:25:41.002 --> 03:25:42.504]  Also, the Drudge Report just updated.
[03:25:42.544 --> 03:25:51.794]  Washington Post, White House chief for sale, Obama, courts big donors, and Obama is doing White House fundraisers in the White House, which is illegal.
[03:25:52.375 --> 03:25:58.181]  Webster, I don't mean to get off on other issues, but you've got to stay longer now, because I promise to go to calls for you, so hopefully you can stay into the next segment.
[03:25:58.201 --> 03:25:58.802]  This is a short one.
[03:25:59.002 --> 03:25:59.203]  Sure.
[03:25:59.383 --> 03:26:00.744]  It's like a time warp on the show.
[03:26:03.327 --> 03:26:06.932]  Government at every level just doesn't care about the law anymore.
[03:26:07.373 --> 03:26:10.537]  And that always, I guess, happens when you go into these degenerate phases.
[03:26:12.768 --> 03:26:18.011]  Well, I mean, certainly one thing you see here is just anarchy, right?
[03:26:18.071 --> 03:26:25.736]  You've got, on the one side, you've got a government which is functioning, on the whole, rather well, given the circumstances.
[03:26:26.356 --> 03:26:38.363]  On the other hand, in Benghazi, you've got, you know, 35 factions and, you know, they're trying to get, each faction is trying to get NATO to bomb the other faction by sending in false reports to NATO.
[03:26:38.383 --> 03:26:38.904]  And then you've got,
[03:26:39.524 --> 03:26:45.131]  In the world, right, at the level of the UN, you've got total and total anarchy there, because there is this UN Charter.
[03:26:45.531 --> 03:26:57.325]  It does say the only way that they can apply military force is supposed to be for threats to international peace and security, and not anything to do with the internal affairs of sovereign states, so they've basically trampled that.
[03:26:57.995 --> 03:27:11.304]  So the Security Council has violated the Charter, and there's the problem with that whole system, that there's no mechanism to strike down what you'd call an unconstitutional decision by the
[03:27:11.949 --> 03:27:13.970]  What about the Nobel Committee?
[03:27:13.990 --> 03:27:16.752]  I mean, it'd be like giving Hitler or Stalin a Nobel Peace Prize.
[03:27:31.900 --> 03:27:39.789]  Yeah, you know, maybe some of them are going to resign, or maybe, I don't know, maybe some of them will do something to draw the consequences of their idiocy.
[03:27:40.069 --> 03:27:47.437]  The other thing, though, is remember, when you're in a world depression, and we are, then that's when, you know, the respectful law breaks down.
[03:27:47.477 --> 03:27:48.778]  Look at the 1930s.
[03:27:49.419 --> 03:27:51.541]  Depression leads to dictatorship, and
[03:27:52.680 --> 03:28:04.847]  And the, you know, the domination of, you know, unbridled caprice and unbridled willfulness by some, you know, powerful dictator or other figure, and then that leads to world war.
[03:28:04.867 --> 03:28:06.508]  So we're stuck right in the middle of that right now.
[03:28:09.755 --> 03:28:11.996]  Well, it looks like they're planning to go in with the ground forces.
[03:28:12.016 --> 03:28:20.180]  They're hoping they can assassinate Gaddafi, but obviously he's scurrying around to different warrens, so he's good at hiding.
[03:28:20.220 --> 03:28:21.781]  Doesn't look like that's going to work too well.
[03:28:22.121 --> 03:28:25.702]  This is someone, again, who has survived for 42 hours.
[03:28:27.598 --> 03:28:29.759]  Years in a hot corner, right?
[03:28:29.819 --> 03:28:35.141]  And there have been, you know, more assassination attempts than you can count, right?
[03:28:35.201 --> 03:28:38.923]  Reagan tried to kill him with an air raid in 1985, killed his daughter.
[03:28:38.943 --> 03:28:51.548]  The British gave 100,000 pounds to an Al-Qaeda group in 1995-96, tried to kill him, didn't get him, killed some civilians, and it just goes on and on.
[03:28:51.648 --> 03:28:53.229]  And now we've got this
[03:28:54.102 --> 03:29:04.508]  Terror, the terror that, uh, the arrow that flies by day and the terror that stalketh by night, and the terror that stalketh by night around here is the NATO bombing, which has been contained.
[03:29:04.588 --> 03:29:16.836]  But, uh, Thierry Meysel was on the television here last night, and, uh, obviously NATO didn't like what he was saying, as they went and bombed one of the relay towers of the television signal.
[03:29:19.474 --> 03:29:21.995]  And again, tell folks who that is, for those that don't know.
[03:29:22.055 --> 03:29:26.516]  Tyrion Lannister is one of the first people in the world to say that there was no Boeing at the Pentagon.
[03:29:26.536 --> 03:29:31.138]  In other words, in terms of 9-11 truth, he's one of the first, right?
[03:29:31.698 --> 03:29:37.980]  Very early on, talking about... Wow, he is inside Tripoli?
[03:29:39.200 --> 03:29:39.400]  Yes.
[03:29:40.841 --> 03:29:43.261]  I gotta hear about this, then phone calls on the other side.
[03:29:43.281 --> 03:29:46.763]  From Tripoli, live, Webster Griffin Tarpley.
[03:29:47.283 --> 03:29:47.843]  Stay with us.
[03:29:50.171 --> 03:29:53.173]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:54.114 --> 03:29:56.776]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.805 --> 03:30:04.867]  The number one secret to having great health and long life is having high levels of glutathione.
[03:30:05.027 --> 03:30:16.312]  This master antioxidant is required by your body to stop free radicals, keep cells young, remove chemical and heavy metal toxins, support immunity, support liver functions, stop inflammation, and much more.
[03:30:16.692 --> 03:30:24.175]  The results of optimal levels of glutathione in your body are more mental and physical energy, stronger immune system, greater endurance, and more.
[03:30:24.195 --> 03:30:28.978]  Do you know the number one secret superfood that helps increase your glutathione levels by 64% or more?
[03:30:30.138 --> 03:30:33.099]  It's unheated whey protein powder from grass-fed cows.
[03:30:33.459 --> 03:30:37.400]  This health food is amazing in its ability to do so much for virtually everyone.
[03:30:37.900 --> 03:30:43.421]  Introducing One World Whey, an industry-first unheated whey protein powder from grass-fed cows.

[03:30:45.542 --> 03:30:46.362]  That's OneWorldWhey.com.
[03:31:01.089 --> 03:31:09.392]  The folks at eFoodsDirect have saved you from the huge price increases on food by buying raw materials ahead and packing your supplies themselves.
[03:31:09.892 --> 03:31:13.874]  They haven't increased their prices on great long-term food reserves since last year.
[03:31:14.234 --> 03:31:19.296]  With the rising cost of raw materials and gas prices, they can't hold off any longer.
[03:31:19.936 --> 03:31:27.763]  As of July 1st, E-Foods Direct is forced to increase their prices so they can still ship you the best storable food on the planet.
[03:31:28.084 --> 03:31:33.428]  Until the end of June, you can lock in the cost of your food at last year's prices by calling 800-409-4200.
[03:31:35.370 --> 03:31:36.150]  We're good to go.
[03:31:59.241 --> 03:32:02.362]  Do you want to learn more about preparing for the hard times ahead?
[03:32:02.482 --> 03:32:07.083]  Have you ever thought about actually getting off the grid and becoming truly self-reliant?

[03:33:02.914 --> 03:33:03.654]  Big Brother.
[03:33:03.914 --> 03:33:05.195]  Mainstream media.
[03:33:05.596 --> 03:33:06.817]  Government cover-ups.
[03:33:06.977 --> 03:33:07.958]  You want answers?
[03:33:08.278 --> 03:33:09.299]  Well, so does he.
[03:33:10.299 --> 03:33:14.683]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:19.133 --> 03:33:21.375]  Well, I think we pretty much covered it.
[03:33:49.409 --> 03:34:05.941]  The determination here is very great, and they think they're winning, and they're fiercely proud of the fact that they've stood up to the NATO bombing for quite a bit longer than Serbia, and there's also been a ground war going on.
[03:34:06.762 --> 03:34:17.610]  So, again, looking at those assault rifles and those RPGs and that tribal structure, I think it's the last place in the world anybody in his right mind would want to
[03:34:18.294 --> 03:34:22.055]  And I sincerely hope that this won't happen.
[03:34:22.115 --> 03:34:23.976]  And again, I would urge people to get busy.
[03:34:24.056 --> 03:34:30.618]  If the Congressman is going to be around for one of these Fourth of July recess town meetings, get in there and say, this has to end.
[03:34:30.738 --> 03:34:32.939]  This is a crime against humanity.
[03:34:32.979 --> 03:34:34.879]  This is savage barbarity.
[03:34:38.520 --> 03:34:43.462]  You mean it's a Peace Prize humanitarian aid mission?
[03:34:44.505 --> 03:34:45.706]  Yeah, right.
[03:34:46.266 --> 03:34:54.591]  And that guy, of course, he's impeachable for a number of reasons, but one of the ones in the first rank is violating the War Powers Act.
[03:34:54.711 --> 03:34:56.012]  I'm sorry, that's a public law.
[03:34:56.432 --> 03:35:00.254]  Presidents shall take care that the laws be faithfully enforced, not violate them.
[03:35:00.594 --> 03:35:01.094]  Impeachment.
[03:35:03.015 --> 03:35:04.396]  Well, you said it, Webster.
[03:35:04.416 --> 03:35:07.158]  How long are you going to be in Libya?
[03:35:07.578 --> 03:35:08.238]  Well, I don't know.
[03:35:08.258 --> 03:35:08.619]  Let's see.
[03:35:08.639 --> 03:35:10.960]  We never know what happens here, right?
[03:35:11.060 --> 03:35:11.700]  Inshallah.
[03:35:12.141 --> 03:35:12.641]  Depends.
[03:35:14.682 --> 03:35:18.123]  So Tarpley, are you going to be joining the forces of Muammar Gaddafi?
[03:35:18.564 --> 03:35:19.444]  No, I don't think so.
[03:35:19.504 --> 03:35:24.686]  I'm just an observer, a foreign reporter.
[03:35:24.946 --> 03:35:34.249]  No, I know, I'm joking, but I can see you like the brigades in the Spanish Civil War, Tarpley out there with a helmet on.
[03:35:36.770 --> 03:35:39.131]  No, I'm not a combat tent in any way.
[03:35:39.191 --> 03:35:40.732]  I'm just a commentator.
[03:35:41.377 --> 03:35:42.158]  I understand that.
[03:35:42.198 --> 03:35:43.178]  Well, you've got a lot of courage.
[03:35:43.198 --> 03:35:48.221]  You know, you were privately and I've been invited by some aid groups and media groups previously.
[03:35:48.841 --> 03:35:51.143]  Cynthia McKinney did and others to go.
[03:35:51.223 --> 03:35:55.805]  I was invited to go with her to Tripoli and I have to say,
[03:35:58.447 --> 03:36:00.709]  It's not even of so much as a fearful thing.
[03:36:00.989 --> 03:36:12.957]  I fear more bedbugs in a Tunisian airport and the cigarette smoke than I fear, you know, being shot down in an aircraft or being killed in a bombardment.
[03:36:13.598 --> 03:36:20.043]  I actually fear going through customs when I come back more than I... I just, you know what, I hate air travel these days.
[03:36:21.003 --> 03:36:27.048]  But I'm tempted to go over there just to... I'm told North Africa is beautiful in its own mysterious way.
[03:36:27.828 --> 03:36:30.869]  This is the golden south here, right?
[03:36:30.889 --> 03:36:34.750]  This is the Mediterranean in all of its splendor.
[03:36:34.790 --> 03:36:38.412]  There are these beautiful trees with red flowers on them.
[03:36:38.452 --> 03:36:43.253]  You look at the port of Tripoli, this basin that they've got.
[03:36:43.833 --> 03:36:50.456]  In the afternoon, it turns silver and gold with the Mediterranean sun, palm trees everywhere.
[03:36:50.476 --> 03:36:51.916]  It's not humid.
[03:36:52.977 --> 03:36:55.858]  The temperatures have been, I would say, moderate, sort of in the 70s to 80s.
[03:36:57.919 --> 03:37:09.561]  Uh, and again, a very modern city, and, uh, again, I'm amazed that there's not animus against the NATO, uh, foreigners coming from NATO states, because with what they've
[03:37:10.217 --> 03:37:12.959]  These NATO guys have done to Libya.
[03:37:12.979 --> 03:37:16.981]  You'd think that foreigners would be getting lynched, but there's not even the breadth of this.
[03:37:17.102 --> 03:37:20.624]  There's a desire to have people come.
[03:37:20.664 --> 03:37:22.905]  I mean, you would be extremely welcome.
[03:37:22.965 --> 03:37:25.947]  I think you would be... No, it sounds like they're pretty sophisticated.
[03:37:29.366 --> 03:37:33.129]  Yeah, these are highly educated people.
[03:37:33.709 --> 03:37:48.500]  There was a whole program of sending people to Europe, to the United States, to Australia, to Malaysia, to all kinds of places to build up an educated working population of people who can contribute and you really see the benefit.
[03:37:50.955 --> 03:38:08.260]  The people who are in the top positions, you know, date back to the late 60s and 70s, but their children and the other sort of younger age cohorts are all people with, you know, they've all got degrees from this or that U.S.
[03:38:08.341 --> 03:38:10.361]  or European university.
[03:38:10.381 --> 03:38:13.222]  You know, you can pick French or Italian or English.
[03:38:13.742 --> 03:38:16.503]  All of those are going to get you just about anything you need.
[03:38:18.157 --> 03:38:23.721]  Wow, and meanwhile we're told that it's another evil Middle Eastern group that has to be destroyed.
[03:38:24.362 --> 03:38:36.530]  Yeah, again, and the people that you're supposed to support are indeed these characters with the beards, the benighted ones, whose favorite occupation was setting the roadside bombs in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[03:38:36.570 --> 03:38:41.934]  And of course, when they were in Iraq, they were killing more Iraqis than U.S., but they killed quite a few U.S.
[03:38:42.054 --> 03:38:42.675]  troops also.
[03:38:44.830 --> 03:38:46.772]  But, we're told Al-Qaeda's now good.
[03:38:47.052 --> 03:38:49.575]  I mean, we're not going to agree with that, but that's because we're un-American.
[03:38:51.517 --> 03:38:54.961]  Let's take a few calls for Griffin Tarpley, tarpley.net.
[03:38:55.882 --> 03:38:57.824]  Let's talk to Jack in Pennsylvania.
[03:38:57.884 --> 03:38:58.665]  Jack, you're on the air.
[03:38:59.955 --> 03:39:01.916]  Hello, I have a question for Webster.
[03:39:03.457 --> 03:39:07.620]  Do you think, recently you just said that there's no animus towards the foreigners.
[03:39:08.000 --> 03:39:13.864]  Do you think this has anything to do with water fluoridation programs or anything that are going on in the Middle East?
[03:39:14.004 --> 03:39:16.606]  No, and I have no idea about any of that.
[03:39:16.706 --> 03:39:18.267]  I think it's just that this is a very
[03:39:19.219 --> 03:39:23.722]  Educated and civilized population, and they've had the benefits of progress, right?
[03:39:23.742 --> 03:39:35.909]  They went from the, again, the very lowest rung of the sort of international statistics to being where they are now, which is they are the most educated, most developed population in Africa, bar none.
[03:39:36.029 --> 03:39:45.775]  And somehow that's a crime, and how you can accuse a government that's done that of having no merit, you know, and it has to go, this makes no sense.
[03:39:45.895 --> 03:39:46.896]  It's Orwellian.
[03:39:47.890 --> 03:39:48.590]  It is, Orwelly.
[03:39:48.630 --> 03:39:49.851]  And Jack, anything else?
[03:39:51.512 --> 03:39:51.632]  Uh, no.
[03:39:51.652 --> 03:39:53.393]  I just want to say you're a big fan, Alex.
[03:39:53.413 --> 03:39:55.054]  Keep doing your thing.
[03:39:55.114 --> 03:39:55.935]  All right.
[03:39:55.975 --> 03:39:56.415]  Thank you, sir.
[03:39:56.455 --> 03:39:57.356]  Appreciate your call.
[03:39:59.457 --> 03:40:00.818]  Al in Illinois, you're on the air.
[03:40:01.778 --> 03:40:02.619]  Yeah, sorry.
[03:40:04.940 --> 03:40:06.661]  Something weird's going on with the phone system.
[03:40:06.681 --> 03:40:08.462]  The calls are really, really loud.
[03:40:09.483 --> 03:40:10.003]  And he dropped.
[03:40:10.063 --> 03:40:10.263]  Okay.
[03:40:10.303 --> 03:40:11.444]  Jim in Georgia, go ahead.
[03:40:11.464 --> 03:40:11.964]  You're on the air.
[03:40:12.004 --> 03:40:12.925]  And then Chance in India.
[03:40:14.198 --> 03:40:15.499]  Indiana, close enough.
[03:40:15.879 --> 03:40:17.200]  Hey, go ahead, Jim.
[03:40:17.900 --> 03:40:22.643]  Okay, immense love and respect to you both, Alex Jones and Wester Tarkley.
[03:40:22.663 --> 03:40:23.284]  Thank you.
[03:40:24.405 --> 03:40:27.186]  It's wonderful to be able to speak to you.
[03:40:27.286 --> 03:40:28.547]  Ran into Alex Jones real quick.
[03:40:28.787 --> 03:40:32.190]  Ran into Alex Jones right about DU and September the 11th.
[03:40:33.090 --> 03:40:36.753]  And I've been a truth seeker for just about my entire life.
[03:40:38.314 --> 03:40:40.455]  My thing, and I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous because
[03:40:41.028 --> 03:40:42.208]  It's hard to get a hold of it.
[03:40:42.668 --> 03:40:45.129]  I'm so glad the word and the message and you have a lot of callers.
[03:40:45.609 --> 03:40:57.432]  But, um, my point is, um, where's the Christian voice in all these beautiful souls overseas being killed by the, uh, Wendy.
[03:40:57.932 --> 03:41:05.194]  I want to cut, but when people drones that are just being sent everywhere, like they're flown by cowards.
[03:41:05.794 --> 03:41:08.755]  And, uh, what kind of way is that to fight a war?
[03:41:09.655 --> 03:41:09.695]  Uh,
[03:41:10.635 --> 03:41:19.858]  We have, let's see, why can't people see the same people who created these derivatives, these fake derivatives, and sold them all over the world.
[03:41:20.578 --> 03:41:21.859]  They're going to bring the drones here.
[03:41:21.879 --> 03:41:23.720]  That's the way it's going to work.
[03:41:24.140 --> 03:41:25.780]  It's not going to stop over there.
[03:41:26.000 --> 03:41:26.781]  It's coming here.
[03:41:27.561 --> 03:41:30.422]  Why can't people see what's going on?
[03:41:31.530 --> 03:41:37.213]  Well, this was the first big issue in World War I, because now people were just killing each other en masse.
[03:41:37.233 --> 03:41:40.375]  There was zero chivalry involved.
[03:41:40.455 --> 03:41:46.198]  And then World War II, the dropping of bombs on civilians as targets, and both sides doing it.
[03:41:46.358 --> 03:41:55.822]  And then now today, you have people thousands of miles away in an office park flying drones, you know, going in and killing men, women, and children, and calling it
[03:41:57.223 --> 03:42:11.694]  Humanitarian, more and more as we become removed from the war through the technological apparatus, it allows more and more of a delusional, oh this is peace.
[03:42:13.635 --> 03:42:18.499]  People aren't seeing the sausage being made and I think it shows the
[03:42:19.400 --> 03:42:24.763]  We have been such a wealthy society that we've become decadent and slob-like in one group.
[03:42:25.003 --> 03:42:28.986]  Other people are working harder than ever as the economy begins to unravel.
[03:42:29.626 --> 03:42:31.808]  And so you kind of have those two worlds colliding.
[03:42:31.908 --> 03:42:34.469]  And, you know, most Americans don't have passports.
[03:42:34.489 --> 03:42:35.310]  They've never traveled.
[03:42:35.610 --> 03:42:37.111]  We kind of live in our own bubble here.
[03:42:38.151 --> 03:42:39.332]  And I think that's what's happening.
[03:42:39.352 --> 03:42:41.013]  I appreciate your call, Jim.
[03:42:41.754 --> 03:42:43.895]  Any comments on that, Webster?
[03:42:44.295 --> 03:42:52.157]  Well, the voice of Christianity here is the Roman Catholic Bishop who, you know, points out that you can't have Christianity and bombs.
[03:42:52.177 --> 03:42:52.998]  These don't mix.
[03:42:54.078 --> 03:42:55.778]  Sorry to anybody who thinks they do.
[03:42:57.079 --> 03:43:04.581]  You know, that was the Prince of Peace, and that under Gaddafi, say what they will, there is total religious freedom.
[03:43:05.442 --> 03:43:06.483]  Let's talk to Chance in Indiana.
[03:43:06.563 --> 03:43:08.084]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[03:43:08.104 --> 03:43:08.845]  Hey, how you guys doing?
[03:43:35.100 --> 03:43:37.942]  Alex, I want to say good job yesterday at the State Capitol.
[03:43:38.183 --> 03:43:39.504]  I watched you guys online.
[03:43:39.984 --> 03:43:40.484]  Thank you.
[03:43:40.504 --> 03:43:42.066]  You guys did an excellent job.
[03:43:43.066 --> 03:43:45.008]  Real quick, a couple things about Libya.
[03:43:45.468 --> 03:43:48.811]  I wanted to let you and your viewers know, reaffirm more.
[03:43:48.831 --> 03:43:51.353]  You guys were talking about whether we are or aren't going to Libya.
[03:43:51.393 --> 03:43:52.494]  It's kind of confirmed now.
[03:43:52.514 --> 03:44:03.583]  I recently had it confirmed to me through a family member that he is going to a training, a two-week training thing.
[03:44:04.281 --> 03:44:06.542]  Within the United States, and then he is going to Libya.
[03:44:07.202 --> 03:44:12.445]  So just to more reaffirm that there are reports out there and other stuff through Fort Hood and stuff.
[03:44:13.165 --> 03:44:33.415]  And then, second for Dr. Tarpley, I just wanted to, and you Alex, I wanted to ask both of you real quick what you think the best thing for the common person, you know, such as myself, to do as far as affecting local, you know, federal legislation
[03:44:41.073 --> 03:44:44.955]  Well, Webster talks about we only need, what, 40 or so votes to get the... 30 votes.
[03:44:45.035 --> 03:44:52.020]  You ship 30 votes in the House, and you've passed the bill to cut off the funds.
[03:44:52.120 --> 03:44:54.922]  Now, that doesn't... You know, there's still the Senate, right?
[03:44:54.982 --> 03:44:56.183]  And then there's still Obama.
[03:44:58.461 --> 03:45:02.188]  What Obama is doing right now is he's bootlegging money.
[03:45:02.248 --> 03:45:07.919]  In other words, there's money lying around in the Pentagon and they redirect it, which really is illegal.
[03:45:10.398 --> 03:45:17.183]  I don't mean to say that having this funding cutoff past the House would be the end of it.
[03:45:17.844 --> 03:45:24.168]  It probably wouldn't, because Obama would keep squirming and lying and whatever.
[03:45:24.728 --> 03:45:28.091]  But it would be a big step, and 30 votes.
[03:45:28.211 --> 03:45:32.874]  Now, some people are going to be interested in the fact that the rebels are from Al-Qaeda,
[03:45:33.698 --> 03:45:45.805]  Other people are going to be interested in the fact that black Africans and black Libyans are getting preferentially massacred by these people in Benghazi and, you know, some other people may have just humanitarian concerns.
[03:45:45.845 --> 03:45:47.026]  There are still such people.
[03:45:47.706 --> 03:45:54.370]  But shift 30 votes and make that a project for the 4th of July recess because
[03:45:55.271 --> 03:45:57.132]  This stuff has got to end somewhere, right?
[03:45:57.172 --> 03:45:57.733]  If the U.S.
[03:45:57.813 --> 03:46:10.545]  is simply just on this rampage through the world, right, eventually you're going to collide with some large thing that resists and can defend itself, be it Russia or China or Iran or whatever it is.
[03:46:10.585 --> 03:46:16.111]  So the quicker we end this stuff, the better it is, and the political calculation is that
[03:46:17.062 --> 03:46:23.272]  You know, 180 votes in the House to cut off money for a war in the middle of the war, that's unprecedented.
[03:46:23.313 --> 03:46:26.859]  That's the best result of that kind that I've seen in my lifetime.
[03:46:27.518 --> 03:46:34.661]  They can't say that you're cutting off the money to the troops in harm's way, because Obama has guaranteed that there are no troops in harm's way.
[03:46:34.701 --> 03:46:35.481]  Well, there really are.
[03:46:35.861 --> 03:46:37.121]  But we'll take him at his word.
[03:46:37.161 --> 03:46:42.343]  There are no troops in harm's way, so there's no political price to be paid for cutting off the funding.
[03:46:42.383 --> 03:46:44.464]  So cut off the funding, dear Congressman.
[03:46:44.844 --> 03:46:47.345]  Cut off the funding, and if Obama persists,
[03:46:47.885 --> 03:46:59.098]  The one thing that the House can do, if he just says, I'm just going to ignore you and keep spending, because I can stop this in the Senate, well, what the House can do is impeach him.
[03:46:59.419 --> 03:47:00.199]  So, impeach him.
[03:47:01.981 --> 03:47:04.244]  I appreciate your call, caller.
[03:47:04.264 --> 03:47:07.528]  Have you got any other comments I'd like to hear before we go to Keith?
[03:47:09.611 --> 03:47:19.399]  Look, this is how the psychology works, especially with a country like the United States that has taken on preemptive war as part of our macho identity.
[03:47:19.419 --> 03:47:23.763]  I mean, it's the opposite of what this country was founded on, but once we're committed,
[03:47:24.798 --> 03:47:25.578]  And once the U.S.
[03:47:25.598 --> 03:47:29.739]  troops start dying, the social engineers know the opposite's going to happen.
[03:47:29.799 --> 03:47:32.380]  There isn't going to be more calls for pulling out.
[03:47:32.500 --> 03:47:44.883]  It's going to suddenly be, we've got to hang that guy Qaddafi, and then they'll say that they're raping Easter bunnies with elves attending and that sea serpents were seen involved with it.
[03:47:46.663 --> 03:47:52.567]  So they'll make up some ridiculous story of baby incubators, you know, Santa Claus, things like that.
[03:47:53.888 --> 03:47:59.993]  And that's why they want to go ahead and just get in place, get it ready, get the intel, move the troops in and say this is not a war.
[03:48:00.413 --> 03:48:03.515]  He killed our humanitarian troops rolling in on Abrams tanks.
[03:48:04.816 --> 03:48:08.499]  And it's just incredibly cold-blooded.
[03:48:09.299 --> 03:48:10.320]  Webster, any comments on that?
[03:48:14.602 --> 03:48:15.763]  Webster Tarpley, can you hear me?
[03:48:16.363 --> 03:48:17.584]  Sorry, I missed the last part.
[03:48:18.024 --> 03:48:23.368]  Well, no, I mean, they know once they get ground troops in there that then people will say, well, we've got to end it to win it.
[03:48:23.408 --> 03:48:24.849]  You know, we've got to get it done.
[03:48:25.389 --> 03:48:28.871]  Well, this is going to be a horrifying experience.
[03:48:29.011 --> 03:48:30.752]  I hope we don't have to see this.
[03:48:30.873 --> 03:48:31.733]  I really don't.
[03:48:32.133 --> 03:48:32.954]  Do something now, right?
[03:48:32.994 --> 03:48:37.697]  Let us work now while it is called the day for the night comet in which no man can work and no woman either.
[03:48:39.478 --> 03:48:40.319]  Anything else, Chance?
[03:48:41.956 --> 03:48:43.497]  Yeah, I have one quick thing.
[03:48:43.517 --> 03:48:45.058]  Good stuff, guys.
[03:48:45.078 --> 03:48:48.580]  I appreciate you answering my question and getting it out there for us common folks.
[03:48:49.241 --> 03:48:52.583]  And I just wanted to say that I'm going to call back, try to call back sometime in the week.
[03:48:53.023 --> 03:49:04.470]  I wanted to discuss with you that video, in regards to the video you showed the other day, Plain Doppler, and some interesting stuff I found about Forum for the Future, the three groups that are heading up the campaign that produce some cookies.
[03:49:05.217 --> 03:49:20.599]  Yeah, Webster, that's these Malthusian films they show kids that actually show an incredible tyranny where you can't travel, you don't get meat, everything's surveilled, there's basically families don't exist, and they show it with straight faces to children.
[03:49:21.440 --> 03:49:24.782]  And now they're expanding into Maryland, where you live.
[03:49:25.262 --> 03:49:27.463]  Adds environmental literacy in high schools.
[03:49:27.843 --> 03:49:29.464]  Everything is political correctness.
[03:49:30.004 --> 03:49:36.607]  Everything is flogging humanity, teaching you to hate humanity, and that carbon is evil.
[03:49:38.068 --> 03:49:43.991]  And now Maryland schools will be even less time, and California's moving to get rid of homework.
[03:49:45.513 --> 03:49:48.776]  So there can be more time for the kids to watch television and be programmed that way.
[03:49:50.298 --> 03:49:53.601]  What can you say about just the absolute Malthusian brainwashing?
[03:49:54.501 --> 03:49:58.225]  Well, we have a tremendous social crisis and we have a depraved elite.
[03:49:58.285 --> 03:50:01.428]  Some of them are monetarists and some of them are Malthusians.
[03:50:03.630 --> 03:50:09.255]  And neither one of those will allow the survival of civilization as we've known it.
[03:50:11.481 --> 03:50:17.063]  I've written up my ideas on my website there, Tarpley.net, so I commend that to your attention.
[03:50:17.803 --> 03:50:20.404]  Tarpley, we're going to come back and take a final call or two for you.
[03:50:20.705 --> 03:50:23.045]  I, quite frankly, am exhausted.
[03:50:23.065 --> 03:50:28.027]  I've now done almost four hours and was up late last night and did the whole thing at the Capitol.
[03:50:28.687 --> 03:50:34.430]  Now we've got articles up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com that break down what happened there.
[03:50:34.450 --> 03:50:40.252]  And they've got a House version that's pretty bad, and they've got a Senate version that actually
[03:50:41.563 --> 03:50:48.850]  It enshrines TSA groping and molestation as a wondrous sacrament that we almost indulge in.
[03:50:51.012 --> 03:50:55.055]  And so we've got reports on that at InfoWars.com and PrisonPanda.com.
[03:50:55.095 --> 03:50:58.639]  But regardless, it's become a national issue thanks to you showing up yesterday.
[03:51:00.026 --> 03:51:02.308]  Big Berkey Water Filters are in high demand.
[03:51:02.548 --> 03:51:04.369]  Storable foods are also in high demand.
[03:51:04.590 --> 03:51:09.473]  BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com has always kept our focus on the Berkey Water Filter products.
[03:51:09.634 --> 03:51:13.056]  But increasingly, our customers have been asking for storable foods.

[03:51:29.609 --> 03:51:38.556]  Combine our Berkey water filters, which are powerful enough to purify treated, untreated, or even stagnant pond water with our storable foods, and you have a winning combination.

[03:51:59.685 --> 03:52:01.988]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[03:52:02.068 --> 03:52:04.270]  We are part of a New World Order.
[03:52:04.371 --> 03:52:07.214]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[03:52:07.594 --> 03:52:12.340]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:52:12.700 --> 03:52:16.885]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:52:17.205 --> 03:52:19.527]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:52:19.547 --> 03:52:22.089]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:52:22.429 --> 03:52:24.992]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:52:25.352 --> 03:52:32.938]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:52:33.291 --> 03:52:38.536]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:52:38.676 --> 03:52:41.438]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:52:41.518 --> 03:52:44.962]  So it's gonna be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:52:45.222 --> 03:52:46.123]  And I got news for you.
[03:52:46.283 --> 03:52:47.063]  You're everyone else.
[03:52:47.624 --> 03:52:48.625]  Invisible Empire.

[03:54:08.838 --> 03:54:15.060]  I think this is the biggest blow against the TSA and we've got to get this story out to everybody.
[03:54:15.100 --> 03:54:21.622]  I want to thank the Drudge Report for linking to it, but obviously they understand this is tyranny.
[03:54:22.462 --> 03:54:27.664]  Cancer surges in body scanner operators.
[03:54:27.744 --> 03:54:29.604]  TSA launches cover-up.
[03:54:29.624 --> 03:54:31.945]  This is a big, big, big deal.
[03:54:32.898 --> 03:54:52.245]  that uh... because this has been in the Boston airport where this centers in and around for all close to eight years or I don't know late 2002 do the math I guess more than eight years yeah wow yeah eight years and so they've been covering all this up that's big news on that front Webster I'm going to take a final call for you but do you have any comments on that?
[03:54:53.280 --> 03:54:58.663]  Well, do you remember the implementation of the body scanners was the Mutalab case, right?
[03:54:58.703 --> 03:55:01.225]  The Christmas Day underwear bomber.
[03:55:01.285 --> 03:55:05.307]  That was the thing that pushed the whole system into the body scanners.
[03:55:05.387 --> 03:55:13.972]  And you remember the eager lobbying of Michael Chertoff, the former head of Homeland Security, who was out there as a paid lobbyist, but doing commentaries.
[03:55:14.532 --> 03:55:19.756]  At all the television networks, and of course, we didn't need body scanners, did we?
[03:55:19.776 --> 03:55:31.724]  We needed a mole detector at the FBI and the CIA to find out who were the, which federal agency was the one that said, no, Muttalab is going to keep that visa.
[03:55:31.744 --> 03:55:32.825]  We've got eyes on him.
[03:55:32.845 --> 03:55:34.366]  He's going to lead us to the big fish.
[03:55:34.766 --> 03:55:38.289]  That was that interagency meeting with the State Department that he's claimed later.
[03:55:38.909 --> 03:55:50.873]  And this was, I guess, Undersecretary of State Kennedy, that the State Department wanted to pull his visa, which would have kept him off the plane, and some other federal agency said, no, no.
[03:55:50.973 --> 03:55:52.733]  No, they said intelligence agency.
[03:55:53.013 --> 03:55:54.314]  Yeah, help get him on the plane.
[03:55:54.654 --> 03:55:58.195]  Jumping back to calls, Lily in France.
[03:55:58.235 --> 03:55:59.755]  You're on the air with Webster Griffin Tarpley.
[03:55:59.775 --> 03:56:00.136]  Go ahead.
[03:56:01.356 --> 03:56:03.076]  Yeah, thank you, Alex, for taking my call.
[03:56:03.117 --> 03:56:06.237]  I know you're really busy there at Manning headquarters.
[03:56:08.550 --> 03:56:20.005]  Yeah, I've noticed across the street over there in Pakistan, Iran, and Afghanistan that they had a meeting last weekend in Iran, President from Pakistan and Karzai.
[03:56:21.093 --> 03:56:27.896]  And they've all agreed to get together and not allow the Americans to set up their bases there until 2017.
[03:56:28.617 --> 03:56:31.678]  Has Webster heard anything about that at all?
[03:56:31.718 --> 03:56:33.919]  Yeah, Webster, what she's saying is in the news.
[03:56:33.939 --> 03:56:38.542]  So the whole world is lining up now against the U.S., England, and Europe.
[03:56:39.062 --> 03:56:44.584]  And as you know, Pakistan has run to China, and so has Saudi Arabia with Russia.
[03:56:44.604 --> 03:56:45.205]  Go ahead, Webster.
[03:56:45.965 --> 03:56:50.927]  I'm afraid I'm not as well informed as I usually like to be, just because of the difficulty here.
[03:56:50.947 --> 03:57:06.352]  We had a couple of days when the internet was down completely because of the wonderful NATO contributions to democracy playing havoc with the internet here, and even telephones, difficult in some areas, but it's bounced back.
[03:57:06.392 --> 03:57:09.453]  So I would just say that the general idea is that
[03:57:10.668 --> 03:57:21.466]  Uh, Karzai, whatever he is of Afghanistan, he's looking to China and Russia for his future, and Pakistan, of course, to China, and perhaps also to some others.
[03:57:23.550 --> 03:57:38.417]  Iran, I've been discussing Ahmadinejad of Iran, and it turns out that he is the industrial military scientific complex of Iran, the sort of modernizing side.
[03:57:38.457 --> 03:57:41.378]  Remember, he's a military guy, comes from the Revolutionary Guard.
[03:57:42.258 --> 03:57:51.683]  And against him you've got Rafsanjani, who is corruption personified, who supposedly has got tremendous amounts of money stashed away in the U.S.
[03:57:51.743 --> 03:57:52.263]  and Europe.
[03:57:53.169 --> 03:57:57.972]  So, better Ahmadinejad than the mullahs.
[03:57:58.072 --> 03:57:59.193]  I guess that's the bottom line.
[03:58:23.289 --> 03:58:26.752]  Offerings are given to you by the Peace King, Obama.
[03:58:27.093 --> 03:58:29.035]  You ought to be very thankful for his loving peace.
[03:58:29.435 --> 03:58:30.536]  Webster, thank you so much.
[03:58:30.896 --> 03:58:31.577]  Okay, bye-bye.
[03:58:32.077 --> 03:58:33.999]  Great job, everybody, out at the Capitol yesterday.
[03:58:34.059 --> 03:58:35.360]  More folks are down there today.
[03:58:35.881 --> 03:58:38.463]  We don't really want this bill to pass, in my opinion.
[03:58:39.304 --> 03:58:42.247]  It's a whitewash, whitewash.
[03:58:42.267 --> 03:58:43.748]  Back tomorrow, live, 11 a.m.
[03:58:43.788 --> 03:58:44.449]  Spread the word!
[03:58:44.509 --> 03:58:45.290]  Hoorah!
[03:58:45.410 --> 03:58:48.633]  Good job up there, Genesis, as well.
[03:58:49.960 --> 03:58:54.188]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:58:54.509 --> 03:58:58.617]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:58:58.898 --> 03:58:59.940]  Number two, our new
