[00:00:00.296 --> 00:00:01.556]  We've got it.
[00:00:01.556 --> 00:00:07.398]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:00:07.398 --> 00:00:11.799]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:20.481]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:00:20.481 --> 00:00:23.702]  We are live.
[00:00:23.702 --> 00:00:25.542]  It is the last day of July, 2011.
[00:00:29.301 --> 00:00:37.007]  Next stop 2012 and we're going to be live here as we are every Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:00:37.007 --> 00:00:38.328]  Central, 5 to 7 p.m.
[00:00:38.328 --> 00:00:39.649]  Eastern, 3 to 5 p.m.
[00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:41.510]  Mountain, 2 to 4 p.m.
[00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:53.699]  Pacific and we have incredibly intense and important news and information that we're going to be covering today obviously
[00:00:58.052 --> 00:01:04.056]  And so I hope that you will stay with us through the two hours of the show today.
[00:01:04.056 --> 00:01:19.245]  I hope that you will take notes on the information that we are going to cover, because the different developments in our society are of the utmost importance, obviously.
[00:01:22.137 --> 00:01:35.744]  And as I do so many Sundays, when I tend to be more reflective, I'm going to attempt to not go into a bunch of ranting and raving today, but actually get into all of the news.
[00:01:35.744 --> 00:01:46.790]  Obviously, when we come back from break, we're going to get into the whole debt ceiling false debate that gets everybody to obsess on the credit rating.
[00:01:48.214 --> 00:01:58.295]  And on raising the debt and going into more debt instead of asking why are we in this debt and where is most of the money actually owed and will the debt ceiling
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.383]  More even making these paltry cuts the Republicans are calling for.
[00:02:03.383 --> 00:02:04.563]  Fix things.
[00:02:04.563 --> 00:02:05.524]  And the answer is no.
[00:02:05.524 --> 00:02:07.946]  So we're going to be going over all of that.
[00:02:07.946 --> 00:02:08.806]  We have the headlines here.
[00:02:08.806 --> 00:02:14.890]  The top Senator Republicans with the Democrats are very close to a deal.
[00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:21.235]  On default, White House, GOP discuss potential debt limit pact with 48 hours left to go.
[00:02:21.235 --> 00:02:22.335]  But don't worry.
[00:02:22.335 --> 00:02:27.198]  The private rating agencies, S&P, Moody's and others are saying it doesn't matter.
[00:02:27.198 --> 00:02:29.140]  Either debt plan will make you lose
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:57.754]  Your AAA rating and that's out of the Hill newspaper there in DC with the inside scoop from Capitol Hill and I want to talk about what a loss of AAA rating is going to mean because it's a foregone conclusion that the debt has been defaulted on the minute we signed on to that 1.5 quadrillion in derivatives and so we'll discuss either way no matter what happens where this country is headed until we get out of the private Federal Reserve's control.
[00:02:59.611 --> 00:03:07.578]  I've got a lot of news also on the economy that we're going to be going over today.
[00:03:07.578 --> 00:03:11.021]  Obviously, we're going to get into the latest on Fast and Furious.
[00:03:11.021 --> 00:03:14.224]  We're going to have a video report.
[00:03:14.224 --> 00:03:18.567]  It's going to be up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com by the end of the show today.
[00:03:18.567 --> 00:03:26.995]  I may even premiere that special report that we worked on Friday, Saturday, and Aaron's up here on Sunday completing it right now.
[00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:39.595]  Very powerful report, video report to accompany this text report by Paul Joseph Watson and Aaron Dykes.
[00:03:39.595 --> 00:03:46.379]  Exclusive ATF intimidates gun owners with home visits.
[00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:51.802]  And we're going to be going over this report obviously here on the show today.
[00:03:53.298 --> 00:03:55.079]  And we have another report here from Infowars.com.
[00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.420]  So that's just some of what we're going to be going over in that area.
[00:04:11.247 --> 00:04:20.857]  And we are going to continue looking at some other news items dealing with how our young people are being basically implanted into the matrix.
[00:04:20.857 --> 00:04:28.984]  Facebook and Twitter are creating a vain generation of self-obsessed people with childlike need for Facebook.
[00:04:29.685 --> 00:04:36.030]  You know, feedback-type garbage warns top scientists, and that goes together with this French news agency.
[00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.152]  Xbox addict dies from blood clot.
[00:04:39.152 --> 00:04:42.234]  Another one I never got to last week, but I'm going to cover today if we have time.
[00:04:42.234 --> 00:04:46.297]  Peer pressure causes people to literally alter their memories of recent events.
[00:04:46.297 --> 00:04:48.759]  Why won't people wake up and face reality?
[00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:50.360]  It's because of stuff like this.
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.402]  We're going to be going over all straight ahead.
[00:04:59.332 --> 00:05:02.815]  Hi, this is Steve Shank and Babs Rosberg with eFoods Direct.
[00:05:02.815 --> 00:05:10.583]  Babs, you work a lot with shipping and things are going absolutely nuts with this new Independence Month Patriot Pack that eFoods is giving away.
[00:05:10.583 --> 00:05:14.767]  The way things are going, we're shipping thousands of these great little Patriot Packs out.
[00:05:14.767 --> 00:05:18.951]  Just an example, Sherry from Arkansas made a $1,300 order.
[00:05:18.951 --> 00:05:21.453]  We shipped her five free Patriot Packs, $750 more free food.
[00:05:23.775 --> 00:05:27.077]  Folks are really surprised at what we're actually giving away.
[00:05:27.077 --> 00:05:33.962]  Now folks, we've had 235 years of freedom in this country, so for every $235 worth of food ordered, we give away a $149 Patriot Pack free.
[00:05:33.962 --> 00:05:38.105]  To order the best food on the planet, call 800-409-5633 or go to efoodsdirect.com slash alex.
[00:05:47.208 --> 00:05:52.614]  A free 12-day supply Patriot Pack with every $235 worth of food ordered.
[00:05:52.614 --> 00:06:00.062]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com slash alex.
[00:06:00.062 --> 00:06:05.488]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:05.488 --> 00:06:07.771]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:06:14.824 --> 00:06:31.782]  We are reportedly 48 hours out from a total default on the debt to the foreign governments and private fellow reserve that have taken over this country through economic fraud and have engaged in a conquest that
[00:06:32.663 --> 00:06:41.047]  The British Empire couldn't succeed in, that Hitler couldn't succeed in, that the Soviets couldn't succeed at.
[00:06:41.047 --> 00:06:55.334]  They have conquered us through fraud by stealth, but the moment you become aware of the private banking cartels global government that they're publicly admitting now they're setting up, that you'll pay your VAT taxes to, your carbon taxes,
[00:06:56.054 --> 00:07:01.415]  The rest of it, the minute you're aware of it, then their power begins to wane.
[00:07:01.415 --> 00:07:16.399]  That's why the banksters are setting up a homeland security control grid in every country they're in under international agreements and rules to crack down and go after anybody that criticizes the private central banks running those nations.
[00:07:16.399 --> 00:07:20.460]  When you get the internal training manuals from England, Australia, from Germany,
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.041]  What is globalism?
[00:07:38.035 --> 00:07:41.016]  It is really less than the Fortune 100.
[00:07:41.016 --> 00:07:43.357]  50 or so companies.
[00:07:43.357 --> 00:07:56.642]  And if you look at the board of directors of the Fortune 500 itself, it's almost completely owned and controlled by less than just a few hundred top managers who work for less than 20 wealthy families.
[00:07:56.642 --> 00:07:59.863]  And we've made films on this and broken all of this down.
[00:08:01.076 --> 00:08:17.284]  And globalism, to give you just a snapshot example of what it is before I get into the debt ceiling and the gun grabbing and all the news that's taking place right now that's so vital, we've got to have the big picture and, you know, really pull back and see it in the context.
[00:08:17.284 --> 00:08:29.230]  As Carol Quigley wrote for the CIA in Tragedy and Hope, the head of Georgetown Political Science, Bill Clinton's political mentor, the people running this country want authoritarianism.
[00:08:30.529 --> 00:08:35.693]  And they know that if you only have one flavor of authoritarianism, you'll wake up and fight it.
[00:08:35.693 --> 00:08:42.339]  If you have a simple dictator or a one-party oligarchy that's not hiding itself.
[00:08:42.339 --> 00:08:54.669]  But if you control both parties or all three parties, like in the case of England, then you can have them fight over the power and fight over being the head ringwraith minions over the country.
[00:08:55.523 --> 00:09:02.228]  Because there will be real rivalries and slight differences in rhetoric, but they're still beholden to the very same interests.
[00:09:02.228 --> 00:09:07.412]  Kind of like a Don King boxing match, where he owns both fighters.
[00:09:07.412 --> 00:09:18.259]  People pretty much don't even watch those heavyweight fights anymore that he owns, because people know that it's as rigged as a slot machine in Vegas.
[00:09:18.259 --> 00:09:20.921]  So, that's what we're dealing with here.
[00:09:23.513 --> 00:09:31.138]  Let's take a microcosm example of globalism, and I talk about this every week because it's in the news, and I know people are aware of this.
[00:09:31.138 --> 00:09:42.166]  It's not some more archaic example or an example that isn't as popularly known, but you know about Obama giving out now more than 2,000 waivers to companies.
[00:09:42.166 --> 00:09:47.629]  One waiver for McDonald's, over half a million employees total, don't have to
[00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:49.030]  Or is it 400,000?
[00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:50.371]  I forget the exact number.
[00:09:50.371 --> 00:09:54.394]  The point is, hundreds of thousands of employees don't have to get insurance now.
[00:09:54.394 --> 00:09:56.596]  McDonald's doesn't have to pay for it.
[00:09:56.596 --> 00:10:11.506]  But then the McDonald's competition down the street, some mom-and-pop outfit or some regional, privately owned, true free market group, you, if these rules go into effect, as they're supposed to at the end of this year, you are going to have to purchase that insurance.
[00:10:11.946 --> 00:10:19.800]  And of course you'll lay people off, you'll have less hours, you'll cut the people that you get the insurance force pay, but they'll have insurance.
[00:10:20.737 --> 00:10:24.119]  And the insurance companies, of course, wrote the plan on record.
[00:10:24.119 --> 00:10:27.621]  They get to force 35 million people that didn't have insurance to get it.
[00:10:27.621 --> 00:10:33.964]  The feds get to then lower the standard of care and computers tell doctors what procedures they can do.
[00:10:33.964 --> 00:10:39.627]  The literal death panels, it was in the news this week in England, where they're not giving people cataract surgeries anymore.
[00:10:39.627 --> 00:10:41.448]  They're not giving them cancer surgeries.
[00:10:41.448 --> 00:10:43.189]  That's the National Health Service.
[00:10:43.189 --> 00:10:49.592]  But the profits for the private groups administering it, they go up in England, in Canada, and now here in the U.S.
[00:10:49.872 --> 00:10:53.095]  Oh, they take the money out of your check!
[00:10:53.095 --> 00:10:58.720]  Or in this healthcare system, your employer does, but you just get less care.
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:05.447]  But side issue, this is an example of how these monopoly insiders operate.
[00:11:05.447 --> 00:11:10.732]  So, 2,000 major companies, and it's a list of people that have contributed to the Democratic Party.
[00:11:10.732 --> 00:11:11.813]  This is mafia government.
[00:11:14.349 --> 00:11:15.850]  Don't have to get insurance, but you do.
[00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:16.691]  Let me give you another example.
[00:11:16.691 --> 00:11:18.232]  It was in the news again this week.
[00:11:18.232 --> 00:11:19.694]  General Electric.
[00:11:19.694 --> 00:11:23.257]  The head of General Electric heading up the President's Economic Council.
[00:11:23.257 --> 00:11:25.519]  Deciding where the trillions in quote stimulus money go.
[00:11:26.576 --> 00:11:39.183]  We already saw General Motors over four billion dollars total, a billion and change per country or per region, over a billion bucks to send a new plant part of the economic stimulus of your tax dollars.
[00:11:39.183 --> 00:11:44.947]  You take your tax dollars, stimulate jobs, and a billion plus goes to build a factory in Brazil.
[00:11:46.351 --> 00:11:50.594]  A billion-plus to build one in Eastern Europe, and a billion-plus to move to China.
[00:11:50.594 --> 00:11:52.616]  And then it was in the news this week.
[00:11:52.616 --> 00:12:00.362]  General Electric, who paid zero taxes the last three years in a row, just type in General Electric, paid zero taxes, it'll pull up.
[00:12:00.362 --> 00:12:06.266]  The headline from Friday, moving one of the last divisions they had in North America, U.S.
[00:12:06.266 --> 00:12:09.449]  and Canada, their giant x-ray manufacturing division.
[00:12:10.069 --> 00:12:12.832]  Including government contracts for airports.
[00:12:12.832 --> 00:12:17.816]  That, both medical and security, that is moving to China.
[00:12:17.816 --> 00:12:18.317]  And guess what?
[00:12:18.317 --> 00:12:20.119]  There's bailout money involved in it.
[00:12:20.119 --> 00:12:24.122]  So you are literally paying to have your jobs shipped.
[00:12:24.122 --> 00:12:25.904]  And China has tariffs on us.
[00:12:25.904 --> 00:12:29.327]  They also keep their currency low, which is another tariff.
[00:12:29.327 --> 00:12:30.068]  This is how it works.
[00:12:30.068 --> 00:12:31.870]  They call it, oh, free trade, fair trade.
[00:12:33.121 --> 00:12:35.183]  And so what is Obama doing?
[00:12:35.183 --> 00:12:43.031]  With the Republicans and the head of the Chamber of Commerce and the head of the different business leagues.
[00:12:43.031 --> 00:12:45.674]  What's the word I'm looking for?
[00:12:45.674 --> 00:12:52.120]  What's the big national association of not manufacturers, they're for it too.
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.322]  What's the national association that deals with
[00:12:55.629 --> 00:12:56.209]  Business.
[00:12:56.209 --> 00:13:00.052]  I forget, I saw him on the news Friday and saw the text reports.
[00:13:00.052 --> 00:13:17.562]  The point is, all the so-called lobbies that are for jobs here in the United States, they are lobbying and saying how great this new trade deal with South America and South Korea are to further move jobs.
[00:13:17.562 --> 00:13:24.707]  And months ago, I watched the congressional hearings on C-SPAN dealing with this and I watched the different press conferences they had afterwards because
[00:13:25.367 --> 00:13:31.930]  C-SPAN comboed up congressional coverage and then cut to trade representatives in South Korea in a joint.
[00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:44.377]  It was actually Obama and the South Korean president giving a press conference, and they were admitting that there was a trade deficit of 4 to 1 or more with South Korea, and he was saying these new deals, don't worry, are going to fix that.
[00:13:44.377 --> 00:13:47.959]  And now there's been analysis done, and of course, it's going to make it even worse.
[00:13:47.959 --> 00:13:53.682]  Because the big insider megacorporations own the politicians here.
[00:13:55.145 --> 00:13:55.385]  I don't know.
[00:14:15.441 --> 00:14:17.063]  And this is what globalism is.
[00:14:17.063 --> 00:14:35.380]  Henry Kissinger for Nixon and the different trade associations goes over to China, makes sweetheart inside deals where they can get goods made at slave labor prices that America could never compete with, but if that isn't bad enough, they then put regulations on U.S.
[00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:35.880]  industries
[00:14:36.863 --> 00:14:41.186]  That they don't have in 160 plus third world countries.
[00:14:41.186 --> 00:14:42.387]  The list goes on and on.
[00:14:42.387 --> 00:14:44.969]  And so, of course, all the jobs go there.
[00:14:44.969 --> 00:14:55.197]  Over 80% of our industry manufacturing has left in the last 30 years.
[00:14:55.197 --> 00:15:02.142]  Also, since 2001, the dollar has lost at least 40% more of its purchasing power.
[00:15:02.142 --> 00:15:03.423]  That's the federal government's own numbers.
[00:15:04.747 --> 00:15:07.870]  And so you add all of this together, what's their answer?
[00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:32.630]  Oh, we're going to come in now with carbon taxes only on the United States, Canada, Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand, who are all under the very same strategy, having their own countries bought and paid for by the same megacorporations, shine government laws, shutting down all activity in our countries, while the very politicians are owned by the megacorporations, who own the industries they've developed and invested in, in the third world,
[00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:38.294]  That's a guaranteed investment boost because they've shut down all their competition in the West.
[00:15:38.294 --> 00:15:41.936]  This is crony collectivism by the elite.
[00:15:41.936 --> 00:15:43.678]  This is Monopoly, man.
[00:15:43.678 --> 00:15:45.739]  And this is how they rule us.
[00:15:45.739 --> 00:15:47.440]  This is how they dominate us.
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:58.568]  All right, when we come back, now that we've talked about how this tilted playing table works, this red casino, we're going to get into the so-called debt ceiling crisis and the gun grabbing.
[00:15:58.568 --> 00:15:58.969]  Stay with us.
[00:16:00.299 --> 00:16:08.424]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:16:08.424 --> 00:16:10.966]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:16:10.966 --> 00:16:16.350]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:19.392]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:16:19.392 --> 00:16:21.453]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:16:21.713 --> 00:16:27.958]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:31.340]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:37.124]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:16:37.124 --> 00:16:38.765]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:16:38.765 --> 00:16:40.066]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:16:40.066 --> 00:16:42.728]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:16:42.728 --> 00:16:46.951]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:16:46.951 --> 00:16:49.553]  You can find the video at www dot
[00:16:49.653 --> 00:16:52.835]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:16:52.835 --> 00:16:57.599]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:16:57.599 --> 00:16:58.099]  Number two,
[00:17:09.708 --> 00:17:14.591]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:17:14.591 --> 00:17:15.332]  It's true.
[00:17:15.332 --> 00:17:20.215]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:17:20.215 --> 00:17:21.035]  Number three.
[00:17:21.035 --> 00:17:24.618]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:17:24.618 --> 00:17:28.540]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:29.341]  Number four.
[00:17:29.341 --> 00:17:32.103]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:17:32.103 --> 00:17:35.445]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:17:35.765 --> 00:17:40.706]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:17:40.706 --> 00:17:45.748]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:17:45.748 --> 00:17:49.929]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:17:49.929 --> 00:17:51.709]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:17:51.709 --> 00:17:56.310]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:18:01.058 --> 00:18:05.080]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:08.322]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:18:08.322 --> 00:18:13.105]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:18:13.105 --> 00:18:19.508]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:18:19.508 --> 00:18:21.750]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:22.590]  Tim Geithner?
[00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:23.090]  Bernanke?
[00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:23.891]  They're arsonists!
[00:18:23.891 --> 00:18:25.051]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:18:25.051 --> 00:18:27.292]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:18:41.178 --> 00:18:43.301]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:18:43.301 --> 00:18:48.467]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:18:48.467 --> 00:18:57.597]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:19:01.581 --> 00:19:05.542]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:19:05.542 --> 00:19:14.404]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:19:14.404 --> 00:19:19.045]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:19:19.045 --> 00:19:29.867]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:19:30.487 --> 00:19:40.009]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:19:40.009 --> 00:19:45.431]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:19:45.431 --> 00:19:52.912]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:19:52.912 --> 00:19:55.333]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:20:01.144 --> 00:20:04.747]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[00:20:04.747 --> 00:20:15.595]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:20:15.595 --> 00:20:21.620]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:24.162]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:31.741 --> 00:20:42.136]  Alright, finishing up a simple snapshot analysis of globalism, as it's much more complex and much worse than I'm even saying.
[00:20:44.079 --> 00:21:04.912]  The political traders for several generations in this country have been bought and paid for by some of the most wealthy families and corporations in the world and they come in to democratic nations and use that system against the people with slick packaging to sell one-sided trade deals
[00:21:05.828 --> 00:21:14.224]  That then massively increase their profits in the slave factories and slave wage factories they own and control in the third world.
[00:21:15.413 --> 00:21:28.036]  And now they're trying to squeeze out that last 20% of manufacturing we've got, even as the service industry implodes, and they're coming in with 20 to 50% carbon taxes.
[00:21:28.036 --> 00:21:30.177]  California's passed it.
[00:21:30.177 --> 00:21:42.900]  Starting next year, it'll be 20% tax over a decade, 50% tax on most human activity paid to government, who then goes and signs deals with the big megabanks to go into more debt with them.
[00:21:44.181 --> 00:21:46.202]  And remember, it's debt made out of nothing.
[00:21:46.202 --> 00:21:47.763]  So this is a monopoly game.
[00:21:47.763 --> 00:21:50.385]  We are being economically conquered.
[00:21:50.385 --> 00:22:01.231]  And folks need to start getting a little bit more sophisticated and thinking about exactly how this works.
[00:22:01.231 --> 00:22:03.333]  Because it's going to get a lot worse.
[00:22:03.333 --> 00:22:06.735]  I mean, when you see Bill O'Reilly up there saying, we've got to pay the debts we owe,
[00:22:07.898 --> 00:22:11.021]  We've got to have a national value-added tax.
[00:22:11.021 --> 00:22:13.663]  We've got to have national sales taxes.
[00:22:13.663 --> 00:22:14.964]  We've got to pay our bills.
[00:22:14.964 --> 00:22:18.267]  You know, we've got to cut spending and raise taxes.
[00:22:18.267 --> 00:22:22.471]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is an absolute historical fact.
[00:22:22.471 --> 00:22:28.977]  Every economist who has any brain knows this, that in every case from
[00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:38.223]  Oh, more modern example, a decade ago, Ireland to the 1960s with John F. Kennedy.
[00:22:38.223 --> 00:22:44.146]  Kennedy, in the highest tax bracket, cut taxes by 50%, and in the other bracket, 35.
[00:22:44.146 --> 00:22:46.967]  35% cut in taxes.
[00:22:46.967 --> 00:22:49.888]  Federal income taxes went down to almost nothing.
[00:22:49.888 --> 00:22:51.889]  And do you know what happened by the next year?
[00:22:53.112 --> 00:22:55.174]  A doubling in tax receipts.
[00:22:55.174 --> 00:22:57.977]  Oh, and the next year, another 50% increase.
[00:22:57.977 --> 00:23:02.021]  That's a 150% increase in two years.
[00:23:02.021 --> 00:23:04.663]  And you're like, wait, you cut taxes, more money comes in?
[00:23:04.663 --> 00:23:05.724]  Yes.
[00:23:05.724 --> 00:23:07.165]  It stimulates the economy.
[00:23:07.165 --> 00:23:08.266]  People start spending.
[00:23:08.266 --> 00:23:18.036]  They put that money back into hiring people, back into buying that boat, buying that house, buying that suit, buying that gold, buying that land, going on that vacation.
[00:23:20.703 --> 00:23:26.729]  Buying mama a Cadillac, like Elvis was doing back in the 60s.
[00:23:26.729 --> 00:23:28.772]  And that's what happens.
[00:23:28.772 --> 00:23:29.412]  And it's a fact.
[00:23:29.412 --> 00:23:33.857]  So why then, in the Western world, would they want to raise taxes?
[00:23:33.857 --> 00:23:42.826]  Well, as George Washington said, and as many of our Supreme Court justices have seconded, the power to tax is the power to destroy.
[00:23:43.994 --> 00:23:47.477]  And you've got corporate interest that are exempt.
[00:23:47.477 --> 00:23:51.800]  On average, the Fortune 100 pays 2.4% tax.
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:53.321]  In fact, folks won't believe that.
[00:23:53.321 --> 00:23:56.403]  Will you guys type in General Electric paid zero tax?
[00:23:56.403 --> 00:23:57.864]  Put that on screen.
[00:23:57.864 --> 00:23:59.626]  Then next, say Google paid 2.4.
[00:23:59.626 --> 00:24:03.749]  And one of them is London Guardian, CNN will show it to you.
[00:24:03.749 --> 00:24:05.050]  But wait, there's more.
[00:24:05.050 --> 00:24:07.071]  Then they have all the heads of these companies.
[00:24:07.071 --> 00:24:10.254]  Heads of Google, head of General Electric, I've seen them on the news.
[00:24:11.192 --> 00:24:11.732]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:24:11.732 --> 00:24:14.553]  ABC News General Electric paid no federal taxes in 2010.
[00:24:14.553 --> 00:24:18.134]  I'm sorry.
[00:24:18.134 --> 00:24:23.816]  And then their executives don't either because they sit on foreign boards and why they're exempt over there as well.
[00:24:23.816 --> 00:24:25.577]  But I digress now.
[00:24:25.577 --> 00:24:35.320]  They then have all these ABC specials, you know, this week on ABC with Christina Amanpour and she interviews Bill Gates and Warren Buffett and they say, I'm not paying enough taxes.
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:36.741]  I want to pay more taxes.
[00:24:38.297 --> 00:24:39.523]  It's not fair!
[00:24:39.523 --> 00:24:41.030]  Raise taxes, get the economy going!
[00:24:42.281 --> 00:24:47.225]  These are the people on record in the last 20 years that got the tax codes changed.
[00:24:47.225 --> 00:24:49.086]  Did you know, what was it, 15 years ago or so?
[00:24:49.086 --> 00:24:50.627]  You can pull this up too.
[00:24:50.627 --> 00:24:52.248]  By the way, they just pulled up Bloomberg.
[00:24:52.248 --> 00:24:54.870]  Google 2.4% tax.
[00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:57.732]  Shows how 60 billion lost to tax loopholes.
[00:24:57.732 --> 00:25:00.514]  Bloomberg, October 21st, 2010.
[00:25:00.514 --> 00:25:01.655]  I can show you a laundry list.
[00:25:01.655 --> 00:25:05.338]  The entire Fortune 100 pays almost zero tax.
[00:25:05.338 --> 00:25:07.059]  Oh, some of their domestic employees do.
[00:25:10.507 --> 00:25:11.448]  They are exempt.
[00:25:11.448 --> 00:25:14.109]  See, if you're a domestic corporation, you have to pay it all.
[00:25:14.109 --> 00:25:15.530]  But they are international.
[00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:17.011]  They've written the laws.
[00:25:17.011 --> 00:25:18.932]  And so then they sucker you further.
[00:25:18.932 --> 00:25:22.394]  They come out with all these specials saying, we've given our money to charity.
[00:25:22.394 --> 00:25:24.095]  And you find out it's tax-free foundations.
[00:25:24.095 --> 00:25:28.317]  They actually make giant profits and keep it, but just create new subsidiaries.
[00:25:28.317 --> 00:25:32.640]  Their tax-free foundations pay zero tax domestically when they operate.
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:37.963]  Bill and Melinda Gates, Warren Buffett, all of them, Oprah, they're all part of the same club.
[00:25:37.963 --> 00:25:39.224]  They pay zero
[00:25:39.864 --> 00:26:04.349]  Taxes give a little money to the UN for population reduction and things, as they admit, and then their subsidiary corporations of Microsoft and the rest of it, they get the profit contracts, but the tax-free foundations do deals with multinational foreign corporations who then again are paying zero domestic tax.
[00:26:04.349 --> 00:26:05.729]  You see how that little scam works?
[00:26:08.482 --> 00:26:12.885]  I could keep going on here if you'd like me to, but wait, there's more!
[00:26:12.885 --> 00:26:29.939]  This is the very same crew that are constantly in Time Magazine and The Economist Magazine and Newsweek and Financial Times of London and New York Times lecturing us about how America has greedy, greedy, greedy evil rich people.
[00:26:30.794 --> 00:26:36.137]  And how these greedy, greedy, greedy, evil, rich people aren't paying high enough taxes.
[00:26:36.137 --> 00:26:46.442]  And then when you see the legislation that their tax-free foundations lobby for, it wants to take the highest federal income tax from 35 up above 40.
[00:26:46.442 --> 00:26:50.144]  But when you look at the loopholes, the way it's written, somebody in a 35 is actually paying about 44.
[00:26:50.144 --> 00:26:54.166]  So if it goes to a 40 or 45, it'll be more like a 50.
[00:26:55.506 --> 00:26:56.627]  But wait, there's more.
[00:26:56.627 --> 00:27:03.652]  Then there's all the other taxes, and property taxes, and franchise taxes, and state income taxes, and environmental taxes.
[00:27:03.652 --> 00:27:08.775]  And that's why, on average, people making more than $125,000 a year in the United States pay over 70% in some form of tax.
[00:27:14.517 --> 00:27:19.340]  Warren Buffett says it's greedy if you want to keep 30 percent of your money.
[00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:26.683]  A feudal serf in ancient Europe only had to pay 10 to 20 percent depending on what region, what era, what time.
[00:27:26.683 --> 00:27:28.444]  10 to 20 percent.
[00:27:28.444 --> 00:27:30.806]  20 always caused revolts.
[00:27:30.806 --> 00:27:35.368]  20 percent, everything you produce goes to the king and his local nobles that collect it.
[00:27:35.368 --> 00:27:38.210]  So here in America, somebody paying
[00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:48.135]  Somebody making over $125,000 a year, or a double income of a quarter million, that's considered rich, and you're paying above 70%.
[00:27:48.135 --> 00:27:53.198]  Now, there's this other myth that 51% of the country doesn't pay taxes.
[00:27:53.198 --> 00:27:54.738]  That's a complete lie.
[00:27:54.738 --> 00:28:00.502]  And that's put out so somebody making $40,000 a year hears that and says, well, I'm paying no taxes.
[00:28:00.502 --> 00:28:01.442]  Really?
[00:28:01.442 --> 00:28:05.524]  Do you know anybody who's making $40,000 a year?
[00:28:05.524 --> 00:28:06.845]  And they go, well, I get a refund check.
[00:28:06.845 --> 00:28:07.125]  What, for $1,000?
[00:28:08.746 --> 00:28:10.767]  Do the math on what's pulled out of your check.
[00:28:10.767 --> 00:28:12.148]  What, 30% or so?
[00:28:12.148 --> 00:28:15.370]  I mean, you're talking $40,000 a year.
[00:28:15.370 --> 00:28:20.833]  On average, you're probably paying $7,000, $8,000 just in federal taxes, one way or another.
[00:28:20.833 --> 00:28:27.217]  Then there's all the state taxes, and sales taxes, and enviro taxes, and the hidden carbon taxes.
[00:28:32.259 --> 00:28:41.544]  So, you got the really rich people that have gamed the whole system every angle, they're exempt from all the real taxes, and they're up there lobbying to raise taxes.
[00:28:41.544 --> 00:28:42.785]  Why is that?
[00:28:42.785 --> 00:28:45.306]  Because they get most of the government contracts.
[00:28:45.306 --> 00:28:47.288]  They're corporate welfare whores.
[00:28:47.288 --> 00:28:54.912]  They own the private central banks that in the last three years got at least $27 trillion of American taxpayer money.
[00:28:54.912 --> 00:28:57.934]  They're all reporting record profits from stealing.
[00:28:57.934 --> 00:28:58.394]  We'll be back.
[00:29:00.367 --> 00:29:01.548]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:29:01.548 --> 00:29:08.474]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:29:08.474 --> 00:29:11.036]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:29:11.036 --> 00:29:16.420]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:19.462]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:29:19.462 --> 00:29:21.524]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:29:21.764 --> 00:29:28.029]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:29:28.029 --> 00:29:31.391]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:29:31.391 --> 00:29:37.175]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:29:37.175 --> 00:29:38.816]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:29:38.816 --> 00:29:40.117]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:29:40.117 --> 00:29:42.639]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:29:42.799 --> 00:29:47.000]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.

[00:30:00.263 --> 00:30:03.743]  Hi, this is Steve Shank and Babs Rosberg with eFoods Direct.
[00:30:03.743 --> 00:30:11.145]  Babs, you work a lot with shipping and things are going absolutely nuts with this new Independence Month Patriot Pack that eFoods is giving away.

[00:30:15.687 --> 00:30:19.870]  Just an example, Sherry from Arkansas made a $1,300 order.
[00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:22.351]  We shipped her 5 free Patriot Packs.
[00:30:22.351 --> 00:30:24.692]  $750 more free food.
[00:30:24.692 --> 00:30:28.014]  Folks are really surprised at what we're actually giving away.
[00:30:28.014 --> 00:30:30.155]  Now folks, we've had 235 years of freedom in this country.
[00:30:30.155 --> 00:30:32.636]  So for every $235 worth of food ordered, we give away a $149 Patriot Pack free.

[00:30:59.841 --> 00:31:04.384]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:31:04.384 --> 00:31:05.285]  Number 1.
[00:31:05.285 --> 00:31:08.728]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:31:08.728 --> 00:31:09.568]  Number 2.
[00:31:09.568 --> 00:31:14.472]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:31:14.472 --> 00:31:15.212]  It's true.
[00:31:15.212 --> 00:31:20.096]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:31:20.096 --> 00:31:20.917]  Number 3.
[00:31:20.917 --> 00:31:24.499]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:31:24.499 --> 00:31:28.202]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:31:28.402 --> 00:31:29.202]  Number four.
[00:31:29.202 --> 00:31:31.963]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:31:31.963 --> 00:31:35.644]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:31:35.644 --> 00:31:36.424]  Number five.
[00:31:36.424 --> 00:31:40.565]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:31:40.565 --> 00:31:45.627]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:31:45.627 --> 00:31:49.808]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:49.808 --> 00:31:51.589]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:51.589 --> 00:31:56.190]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[00:31:56.510 --> 00:31:57.451]  877-327-0365.
[00:31:57.451 --> 00:32:02.474]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:32:02.474 --> 00:32:07.798]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:32:07.798 --> 00:32:09.319]  Saving means to make money.
[00:32:09.319 --> 00:32:18.106]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:32:18.846 --> 00:32:26.370]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:34.375]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:32:34.375 --> 00:32:41.779]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you had to do something you've never done before, getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:47.762]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[00:32:47.762 --> 00:32:50.765]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:32:50.765 --> 00:33:01.292]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[00:33:01.292 --> 00:33:02.833]  Coast to Coast.
[00:33:02.833 --> 00:33:04.895]  Direct from Austin.
[00:33:04.895 --> 00:33:08.097]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:33:32.071 --> 00:33:48.962]  Look, it's a law of history, it's a law of human nature, that if you put up with corruption, you are going to be overrun by tyranny.
[00:33:48.962 --> 00:33:52.205]  And somehow, in the last
[00:33:54.532 --> 00:34:06.859]  50 years or so, common sense that you've got to keep government small, you've got to not trust big government, you've got to be informed, you've got to defend liberty, you've got to guard your rights jealously.
[00:34:06.859 --> 00:34:09.841]  Those are all quotes from Thomas Jefferson and George Washington mixed together.
[00:34:09.841 --> 00:34:14.363]  You know, crazy people who founded the country and the reason it's been so great.
[00:34:14.363 --> 00:34:17.185]  Most wealthy, most patents, most developments.
[00:34:18.578 --> 00:34:21.559]  Just more real estate, not even that good of real estate.
[00:34:21.559 --> 00:34:25.221]  Minerals, land, not as good as many other areas of the world.
[00:34:25.221 --> 00:34:34.766]  Mexico has triple the resources conservatively according to CIA fact book than we do here in the United States, but they're totally poor because they've got a tiny ruling class.
[00:34:34.766 --> 00:34:36.507]  But somehow they convince people
[00:34:37.487 --> 00:34:39.008]  Oh, there's no corruption in government?
[00:34:39.008 --> 00:34:39.669]  Go to sleep!
[00:34:39.669 --> 00:34:40.830]  Let them run it!
[00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:43.652]  Give them a National Security Act in 47.
[00:34:43.652 --> 00:34:50.558]  Show all these big mega-banks that set up the CIA and threw skull and bones so they can just do whatever they want.
[00:34:50.558 --> 00:34:50.798]  Ah!
[00:34:50.798 --> 00:34:57.884]  And when we find out they're bringing the narcotics in, they're laundering drug money, they're using government laws to shut down their competition.
[00:34:57.884 --> 00:34:59.886]  What do you expect?
[00:35:00.546 --> 00:35:17.875]  I'm going to get into the whole debt ceiling situation, but I wanted to spend some time first just getting into what globalism is, how it's a bunch of powerful insiders using government to shut down their competition, and then getting half the population dependent on government in some form or fashion, and then every time
[00:35:18.956 --> 00:35:24.245]  The middle class doesn't want to have more of their taxes taken, more of their money taken.
[00:35:24.245 --> 00:35:31.558]  They just threaten to cut off all the chicken feed to the general public, who's now dependent, and they start hopping up and down saying, give me more goodies.
[00:35:32.912 --> 00:35:41.195]  Well, even if they raise the taxes, even if they keep raising the debt ceiling, they're devaluing the currency.
[00:35:41.195 --> 00:35:51.198]  So the chicken feed Social Security you get, the chicken feed welfare card you get, the chicken feed that you're receiving, or your government paycheck.
[00:35:51.858 --> 00:35:54.501]  Or your corporate paycheck from government contracts.
[00:35:54.501 --> 00:35:58.685]  It's shrinking because they're devaluing the denomination.
[00:35:58.685 --> 00:36:00.968]  You're like, well, they'll just pay us more in inflation.
[00:36:00.968 --> 00:36:01.689]  That's not happening.
[00:36:01.689 --> 00:36:08.496]  Wages have been going down for at least five years while the purchasing power of the dollar goes down.
[00:36:08.496 --> 00:36:10.058]  It's called a double whammy.
[00:36:12.244 --> 00:36:15.466]  And by the way, you're like, hey, don't compare Social Security to welfare.
[00:36:15.466 --> 00:36:16.066]  I agree with you.
[00:36:16.066 --> 00:36:16.826]  It's not.
[00:36:16.826 --> 00:36:17.947]  You did pay into it.
[00:36:17.947 --> 00:36:19.588]  They robbed it day one.
[00:36:19.588 --> 00:36:22.910]  When they set it up in the 36, they wanted to get you dependent.
[00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:32.027]  They wanted to get part of your paycheck and put it there so you'd always defend whatever the banksters did because you want the promise of getting your money back.
[00:36:32.027 --> 00:36:34.449]  You're being held hostage.
[00:36:34.449 --> 00:36:43.356]  Now, before I get into the whole debt ceiling and incredible anti-Second Amendment treason, you heard me right, I don't use that word lightly, treason and criminal
[00:36:44.096 --> 00:36:54.045]  Felony actions by the White House that have aided and abetted in the murder of at least three Border Patrol officers and five police officers.
[00:36:54.045 --> 00:37:10.160]  I'm talking about Fast and Furious, huge developments across the country, but also exclusive scoop here in Central Texas from multiple gun dealers about incredible harassment at the hands of the ATF and people buying guns are now being harassed.
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:13.322]  And the ATF is ordering him to do things outside of law.
[00:37:13.322 --> 00:37:14.203]  So that's all coming up.
[00:37:14.203 --> 00:37:16.545]  But I want to stop right here.
[00:37:16.545 --> 00:37:24.451]  I want to stop right here and just give listeners in Germany, in Japan, in Russia, in Mexico, in Brazil, in Chile.
[00:37:24.451 --> 00:37:26.552]  We got listeners all over the world.
[00:37:26.552 --> 00:37:32.577]  Number one on Shoutcast, number one podcast, you know, coming up on three million listeners a day.
[00:37:32.577 --> 00:37:34.939]  Not bragging, but it is a great accomplishment.
[00:37:34.939 --> 00:37:37.941]  It's actually scary we have this many listeners because it's
[00:37:39.215 --> 00:37:41.976]  Because I don't get butterflies going on here.
[00:37:41.976 --> 00:37:46.337]  I can go on national TV, I can walk out and talk to 10,000 people, and I don't get butterflies.
[00:37:46.337 --> 00:37:48.297]  And that's not a good thing.
[00:37:48.297 --> 00:37:58.280]  I've done this so long, so much, that I need those butterflies to realize just how much responsibility we have here.
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:02.081]  But going back to what I was saying, I want to not
[00:38:03.459 --> 00:38:11.883]  I want to be careful here, because I have a lot of sources in the city of Austin, in the media and government, and this affects everybody else around the world.
[00:38:11.883 --> 00:38:14.305]  Whatever's happening here is happening in your town.
[00:38:14.305 --> 00:38:17.486]  We are per capita the wealthiest city in the United States.
[00:38:17.486 --> 00:38:20.108]  We're the fastest growing city in the United States.
[00:38:20.108 --> 00:38:25.811]  We're rated by Forbes and so many others and Fortune as the best place to live in the United States.
[00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:27.740]  I love Austin.
[00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:30.122]  I'm a Texan, and it's my favorite city here.
[00:38:30.122 --> 00:38:32.163]  My mom's from Austin.
[00:38:32.163 --> 00:38:35.605]  I grew up in Dallas, but I've been here since high school.
[00:38:35.605 --> 00:38:39.287]  And I love it.
[00:38:39.287 --> 00:38:49.652]  But we have advocated our responsibility and let a bunch of morons, thugs, and crooks run our city.
[00:38:49.652 --> 00:38:52.934]  Because we just let the politicians run it down there downtown.
[00:38:54.210 --> 00:39:00.773]  And I've made special reports, I've done countless radio shows in the last year on this subject.
[00:39:00.773 --> 00:39:03.914]  Well, not countless, probably a hundred times I've talked about it.
[00:39:03.914 --> 00:39:08.596]  Four or five times the last, you know, few weeks.
[00:39:08.596 --> 00:39:10.797]  And that's Formula One.
[00:39:10.797 --> 00:39:18.461]  And this Formula One issue is a microcosm of everything I just spent the last 30 minutes, 35 minutes talking about.
[00:39:21.809 --> 00:39:23.452]  They passed government health care.
[00:39:23.452 --> 00:39:26.237]  It actually doesn't cover pre-existing conditions.
[00:39:26.237 --> 00:39:27.840]  It's written by the insurance companies.
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:29.623]  Wall Street Journal admits.
[00:39:29.623 --> 00:39:32.408]  Well, the head of the insurance company, Lobby, put out a statement.
[00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:44.159]  It's designed to cut the quality of care, designed to make you buy their products, and then all of the Fortune 100 insiders, they're exempt and given mafia waivers.
[00:39:44.159 --> 00:39:45.861]  That's total discrimination!
[00:39:45.861 --> 00:39:49.384]  But you're looking for discrimination on religion or race or something.
[00:39:49.384 --> 00:39:51.226]  You're not looking where it's really at.
[00:39:51.226 --> 00:39:54.389]  The real discrimination is economic.
[00:39:54.389 --> 00:39:54.629]  Okay?
[00:39:56.041 --> 00:40:02.646]  I mean, if I've got to get my employees insurance, even though they don't want it, I've asked them before and no one wants it here.
[00:40:02.646 --> 00:40:07.250]  They get paid decent and they want to keep it and buy their own insurance or not.
[00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:10.213]  But here's the issue I'm getting, and you say, what does that have to do with Formula One?
[00:40:10.213 --> 00:40:12.334]  The point is, this is the only issue.
[00:40:12.334 --> 00:40:14.476]  It's crony insiders.
[00:40:14.476 --> 00:40:15.757]  Nothing's going to be fixed.
[00:40:15.757 --> 00:40:17.999]  Don't raise the debt, raise the debt.
[00:40:17.999 --> 00:40:21.082]  None of that's going to mean diddly squat.
[00:40:22.887 --> 00:40:24.508]  It's all a distraction.
[00:40:24.508 --> 00:40:28.310]  I'm going to talk about the former head of the Treasury and policy.
[00:40:28.310 --> 00:40:34.733]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts calls it a total distraction in an editorial up at Infowars.com.
[00:40:34.733 --> 00:40:36.074]  He's the father of Reaganomics.
[00:40:36.074 --> 00:40:37.154]  It means nothing.
[00:40:37.154 --> 00:40:39.515]  It's rearranging deck chairs.
[00:40:39.515 --> 00:40:42.377]  So no, the Tea Party's got it wrong and so does Obama.
[00:40:44.943 --> 00:40:48.045]  The Tea Party's got it more right than Obama.
[00:40:48.045 --> 00:40:50.666]  At least they, at some level, mean well.
[00:40:50.666 --> 00:40:52.707]  But perhaps we can impart to them what's really happening.
[00:40:52.707 --> 00:40:53.948]  But that's coming up.
[00:40:53.948 --> 00:40:55.969]  And then your call's in the second hour on the ATF News.
[00:40:55.969 --> 00:40:59.151]  But I want to get into this now.
[00:40:59.151 --> 00:41:14.239]  Before I even get into Formula One, when Dallas, DFW, Metroplex taxpayers, Arlington taxpayers, paid out over a billion dollars to pay for the new Texas Stadium,
[00:41:15.458 --> 00:41:21.362]  Or whatever it's called up there in Arlington.
[00:41:21.362 --> 00:41:24.664]  That's an example of everything wrong.
[00:41:24.664 --> 00:41:30.748]  If the NFL's so profitable, you shouldn't get any tax exemption.
[00:41:30.748 --> 00:41:36.372]  I'm always for cutting taxes, but not when the little guy's always having his taxes raised, because we don't have lobbyists.
[00:41:36.372 --> 00:41:43.877]  And by little guy, you can make $10 million a year, and you don't have any pull in a state legislature, much less federally.
[00:41:43.877 --> 00:41:44.117]  Okay?
[00:41:46.442 --> 00:41:51.045]  You know, there's trillion-dollar outfits in there slugging it out for influence.
[00:41:51.045 --> 00:42:04.095]  And if I don't pay my taxes, if I don't pay all of my property taxes that's rent on property I really don't own, you know, 60, 70 years ago we didn't have property taxes, folks, so don't tell me, oh, we gotta have it to pay for the schools.
[00:42:04.095 --> 00:42:10.000]  Again, this is how we've turned into socialist, little-kept domesticated rats, and people don't even understand it.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:15.124]  We built this country without the IRS, without the income tax, without property taxes, without any of it.
[00:42:16.049 --> 00:42:18.950]  And it's always more, more, more as we get deeper into debt.
[00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:33.732]  So, if I don't pay all my property taxes, they're gonna go to court at the county courthouse, they're gonna take my house, and they're gonna have a auction on the courthouse steps, and they're gonna take my house.
[00:42:33.732 --> 00:42:39.933]  And if I don't leave my house, if I squat in it, they're gonna send police with a bullhorn and say, come out, Mr. Jones.
[00:42:39.933 --> 00:42:43.274]  And after about five hours of this, they're gonna send a SWAT team in to kill me.
[00:42:43.274 --> 00:42:44.634]  Happens every day in America.
[00:42:45.976 --> 00:42:55.772]  So, next time you tell me, oh, well you gotta pay some money so that Jerry Jones can have a sports stadium, remember, remember, people are losing their houses every second.
[00:42:55.772 --> 00:42:57.715]  I'm gonna get into Formula One on the other side.
[00:43:00.182 --> 00:43:04.725]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:43:04.725 --> 00:43:05.646]  Number 1.
[00:43:05.646 --> 00:43:09.069]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:43:09.069 --> 00:43:09.929]  Number 2.
[00:43:09.929 --> 00:43:14.813]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:43:14.813 --> 00:43:15.553]  It's true.
[00:43:15.553 --> 00:43:20.437]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:43:20.437 --> 00:43:21.258]  Number 3.
[00:43:21.258 --> 00:43:24.840]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:28.543]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:43:28.743 --> 00:43:29.544]  Number 4.
[00:43:29.544 --> 00:43:32.306]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:43:32.306 --> 00:43:35.989]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:43:35.989 --> 00:43:36.769]  Number 5.
[00:43:36.769 --> 00:43:40.932]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:43:40.932 --> 00:43:45.676]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:43:45.976 --> 00:43:50.141]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:43:50.141 --> 00:43:51.923]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:43:51.923 --> 00:43:54.186]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:43:54.186 --> 00:43:56.529]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:44:01.235 --> 00:44:04.879]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:44:04.879 --> 00:44:08.503]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:44:08.503 --> 00:44:14.069]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:44:14.069 --> 00:44:19.695]  Tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:44:19.695 --> 00:44:21.938]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:44:22.458 --> 00:44:22.758]  Tim Geithner?
[00:44:22.758 --> 00:44:23.278]  Bernanke?
[00:44:23.278 --> 00:44:24.079]  They're arsonists!
[00:44:24.079 --> 00:44:25.219]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:44:25.219 --> 00:44:27.481]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:44:41.368 --> 00:44:48.637]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:44:48.637 --> 00:44:57.768]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:45:01.704 --> 00:45:05.645]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:45:05.645 --> 00:45:14.506]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:45:14.506 --> 00:45:19.147]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:45:19.147 --> 00:45:29.969]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:45:30.589 --> 00:45:40.111]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:45:40.111 --> 00:45:45.533]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:45:45.533 --> 00:45:53.014]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:45:53.014 --> 00:45:55.435]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:45:59.753 --> 00:46:00.934]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:46:00.934 --> 00:46:07.858]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:46:07.858 --> 00:46:10.420]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:15.804]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:46:15.804 --> 00:46:18.846]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:46:18.846 --> 00:46:20.907]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:46:21.147 --> 00:46:27.412]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:46:27.412 --> 00:46:30.775]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:46:30.775 --> 00:46:36.560]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:38.201]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:46:38.201 --> 00:46:39.502]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:46:39.502 --> 00:46:42.184]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:46:42.184 --> 00:46:46.408]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:46:46.408 --> 00:46:48.449]  You can find the video at www.
[00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:51.012]  End of America 3.com.
[00:46:51.012 --> 00:46:53.595]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[00:47:01.142 --> 00:47:02.684]  Coast to Coast.
[00:47:02.684 --> 00:47:04.726]  Direct from Austin.
[00:47:04.726 --> 00:47:07.949]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:47:13.353 --> 00:47:19.860]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones!
[00:47:26.015 --> 00:47:43.203]  The number one way for the truly wealthy and rich in the world to make money is going in and buying your politicians and getting the politicians to exempt them from laws that the ultra-rich actually lobbied for in the first place, but only to shut down their competition.
[00:47:43.993 --> 00:47:47.434]  And when you understand that, now you have a true understanding.
[00:47:47.434 --> 00:47:50.135]  You are not going to hear Republicans tell you this.
[00:47:50.135 --> 00:47:53.076]  You're not going to hear Democrats tell you this.
[00:47:53.076 --> 00:47:55.676]  This is what the New World Order is about.
[00:47:55.676 --> 00:48:02.478]  A global, private, corporate government of control freaks who are the opposite of free market.
[00:48:02.478 --> 00:48:06.660]  There's a major headline, playing by the NFL's tax-exempt rules.
[00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:09.981]  And if you scroll back to the top, I can give folks the source on that.
[00:48:09.981 --> 00:48:10.321]  Thank you.
[00:48:11.241 --> 00:48:12.682]  We're simulcasting all of this radio show at prisonplanet.tv
[00:48:41.001 --> 00:49:02.398]  The other article here's another one since I mentioned things on there I like to source it Forbes calls Austin number one boomtown okay let's go now to formula one that I raised here Bernie Ecclestone accused of bribery by German prosecutors f1
[00:49:04.065 --> 00:49:07.854]  Supremo alleged to have paid bribes to German banker.
[00:49:07.854 --> 00:49:13.065]  Banker who organized sale of stake of F1 in 2005 is charged.
[00:49:13.065 --> 00:49:14.408]  There's also been some deaths.
[00:49:15.421 --> 00:49:24.204]  Just like when Rupert Murdoch's being investigated, the chief whistleblower said, people are after me, I'm hiding in my house, hitmen are coming, and then he's found dead.
[00:49:24.204 --> 00:49:26.605]  The police within minutes say, no foul play.
[00:49:26.605 --> 00:49:30.006]  Boy, it's like I call 911, hitmen are coming, save me, please!
[00:49:30.006 --> 00:49:32.287]  I'm found dead, oh, I'm on police, nothing happened.
[00:49:32.287 --> 00:49:33.827]  Yeah, because the cops are the hitmen.
[00:49:33.827 --> 00:49:38.229]  Now, continuing here, grow up, folks, stop being naive schmucks.
[00:49:39.690 --> 00:49:47.857]  Suckers, morons, Marx, get some street smarts, get some history, grow up!
[00:49:47.857 --> 00:49:51.500]  Listen, the founders weren't perfect, but they were geniuses.
[00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:55.063]  Foreign philosophers, historians, admirable at the system they set up.
[00:49:55.063 --> 00:49:56.424]  Washington was offered kingship.
[00:49:56.424 --> 00:49:58.125]  He said, I'm leaving to go to the farm.
[00:49:58.125 --> 00:50:01.028]  I like jumping hedgerows and growing hemp.
[00:50:02.901 --> 00:50:07.646]  They set up a system that if you executed it creates absolute wealth and milk and honey.
[00:50:07.646 --> 00:50:18.798]  The problem is then the great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandchildren are a bunch of spoiled brats, so a bunch of sharks come in, take over the government and rob us.
[00:50:18.798 --> 00:50:21.100]  And now we're imploding into a depression.
[00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:25.385]  And the same sharks have new solutions to give them even more power to protect you.
[00:50:25.385 --> 00:50:25.525]  Now,
[00:50:27.435 --> 00:50:33.441]  Did you know that the F1 track is basically tax-exempt because they're an environmental zone?
[00:50:33.441 --> 00:50:37.245]  That's right, as long as they plant a few trees and have a quote, community garden.
[00:50:37.245 --> 00:50:41.348]  This giant, I don't know how many hundreds of acres facility, it's even bigger than that.
[00:50:41.348 --> 00:50:41.969]  I forget the number.
[00:50:41.969 --> 00:50:43.410]  Pull up the full acreage of that for me, guys.
[00:50:44.212 --> 00:50:45.933]  Because they have a little garden and some trees.
[00:50:45.933 --> 00:50:48.716]  They're tax-exempt for enviro reasons.
[00:50:48.716 --> 00:50:50.757]  See, that's what the environmental movement's all about.
[00:50:50.757 --> 00:50:55.161]  What type of toilet you can have, what type of light bulbs you can have, and then they can exempt you if they want.
[00:50:55.161 --> 00:50:57.042]  Oh, we're gonna, you know, tax-free.
[00:50:57.042 --> 00:51:04.248]  And then they're also still getting taxpayer money one way or the other, just like Jerry Jones's billion-plus dollar facility taxpayer paid for.
[00:51:04.528 --> 00:51:06.469]  And they claim, oh, it brings jobs.
[00:51:06.469 --> 00:51:07.229]  Oh, yes.
[00:51:07.229 --> 00:51:09.710]  The overall income of this country is going down.
[00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:11.211]  The dollar is being devalued.
[00:51:11.211 --> 00:51:12.631]  The insiders run things.
[00:51:12.631 --> 00:51:17.693]  Just like I told you NAFTA and GATT was going to be great for the economy when it's a one-sided trade deal.
[00:51:17.693 --> 00:51:21.114]  It's not really free trade or fair trade.
[00:51:21.114 --> 00:51:21.915]  Example of that.
[00:51:21.915 --> 00:51:26.376]  It's not fair if we have higher taxes on our people than China.
[00:51:26.376 --> 00:51:29.978]  It's not fair if we have environmental taxes and carbon taxes and they don't.
[00:51:30.899 --> 00:51:32.901]  You see, that's what tariffs are.
[00:51:32.901 --> 00:51:34.502]  It equalizes.
[00:51:34.502 --> 00:51:36.363]  And that's what built the country.
[00:51:36.363 --> 00:51:41.787]  If you don't like tariffs, you don't like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson.
[00:51:41.787 --> 00:51:43.609]  You're a moron!
[00:51:43.609 --> 00:51:49.974]  Tariffs built this stinking country because it fosters trade inside and outside.
[00:51:49.974 --> 00:51:51.355]  And it's a case-by-case basis.
[00:51:53.268 --> 00:51:59.791]  Remember they told you, don't worry, don't worry, we'll be a service economy after NAFTA and GATT.
[00:51:59.791 --> 00:52:07.696]  First NAFTA and GATT wasn't going to de-industrialize us, and then by a few years after it went into place in 94, everything was shutting down, they said we'll be service now.
[00:52:07.696 --> 00:52:09.597]  Oh, the service economy's falling apart.
[00:52:09.597 --> 00:52:11.998]  We'll put that headline back up there.
[00:52:11.998 --> 00:52:15.540]  F1 track owners get tax break for wildlife area.
[00:52:19.452 --> 00:52:23.975]  That's 1,100 acre.
[00:52:23.975 --> 00:52:28.977]  1,100 acre property owned by Circuit of the Americas.
[00:52:28.977 --> 00:52:31.478]  And who owns that?
[00:52:31.478 --> 00:52:33.179]  Who owns that?
[00:52:33.179 --> 00:52:34.640]  Who owns that?
[00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:39.922]  Oh, I'm sorry, a guy that bought his daughter two giant mansions in the last few months.
[00:52:39.922 --> 00:52:42.103]  He gave her $4 billion because he's got so much cash.
[00:52:42.103 --> 00:52:43.304]  $4 billion.
[00:52:43.304 --> 00:52:45.205]  He gave her $4 billion as a gift.
[00:52:45.205 --> 00:52:47.006]  Here's $4 billion to his 22-year-old daughter.
[00:52:47.995 --> 00:52:49.336]  We can put her up on screen.
[00:52:49.336 --> 00:52:54.922]  She bought a $150 million mansion and another $90 million mansion.
[00:52:54.922 --> 00:52:56.023]  And of course you can.
[00:52:56.023 --> 00:53:04.692]  This guy's got dozens of tracts all over the world, and in every case, it's tax-free and the government pays for it with your money!
[00:53:04.692 --> 00:53:07.075]  I can barely pay my property taxes.
[00:53:08.817 --> 00:53:12.078]  I can barely pay my employees and I give them raises.
[00:53:12.078 --> 00:53:13.278]  I want to take care of them.
[00:53:13.278 --> 00:53:14.579]  They deserve it.
[00:53:14.579 --> 00:53:15.039]  And you know what?
[00:53:15.039 --> 00:53:17.460]  If I didn't have to pay all this garbage, I'd be investing it.
[00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:18.680]  I'd be paying people more.
[00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:20.501]  They'd have money to spend with your business.
[00:53:20.501 --> 00:53:21.821]  But no!
[00:53:21.821 --> 00:53:29.463]  Bernie Ecclestone, this creature, this blob, show his face for viewers.
[00:53:29.463 --> 00:53:31.084]  There's his little hussy daughter.
[00:53:32.475 --> 00:53:36.180]  Petra Ecclestone from one of his little jolly wives.
[00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:37.922]  I'm not spoiled, I'm privileged.
[00:53:37.922 --> 00:53:38.363]  Show her.
[00:53:38.363 --> 00:53:40.125]  The biggest house in the U.S.
[00:53:40.125 --> 00:53:44.010]  And you know what, if she had the biggest house in the U.S., building a widget everybody wanted to buy?
[00:53:44.010 --> 00:53:44.551]  Great.
[00:53:44.551 --> 00:53:46.073]  Or writing a book everybody wanted to buy?
[00:53:46.073 --> 00:53:46.654]  Great.
[00:53:46.654 --> 00:53:47.014]  NO!
[00:53:47.535 --> 00:53:48.216]  NO!
[00:53:48.216 --> 00:53:49.577]  SHE WANTS MY MONEY!
[00:53:49.577 --> 00:53:51.378]  MY LITTLE BIT OF MONEY!
[00:53:51.378 --> 00:53:56.522]  OUT OF THE HUNDREDS OF STINKIN' TAXES I PAY, SHE WANTS MY MONEY TO PAY!
[00:53:56.522 --> 00:53:57.582]  AND THAT'S BAD!
[00:53:57.582 --> 00:53:58.063]  UGH!
[00:53:58.063 --> 00:54:02.306]  THAT CREATURE RIGHT THERE GETS MY TAX MONEY!
[00:54:02.306 --> 00:54:07.469]  WORLDWIDE, HE GETS- HE HAS NOT PAID FOR A STINKIN' RACETRACK ALL OVER THE WORLD IN EVERY CASE!
[00:54:07.469 --> 00:54:08.410]  THIS PIMP!
[00:54:08.410 --> 00:54:09.651]  THIS MOBSTER!
[00:54:09.651 --> 00:54:10.612]  ROLLS INTO TOWN!
[00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:15.722]  And he gets everybody to pay for his stinking racetrack.
[00:54:15.722 --> 00:54:20.325]  He's tax exempt when I'm not, because I'm not a big, fat globalist like he is.
[00:54:20.325 --> 00:54:22.066]  And then his daughter.
[00:54:22.066 --> 00:54:23.467]  Show her mansion again.
[00:54:23.467 --> 00:54:24.587]  How many square feet is it?
[00:54:24.587 --> 00:54:26.108]  I forget.
[00:54:26.108 --> 00:54:28.069]  How many square feet is the mansion?
[00:54:28.069 --> 00:54:29.991]  Looks like it's bigger than the White House.
[00:54:29.991 --> 00:54:33.833]  It's bigger than the palaces the British royalty live in.
[00:54:33.833 --> 00:54:40.837]  Of course he can peel off $4 billion for his daughter, because he's got my money and your money sitting in his dirty pockets.
[00:54:43.055 --> 00:54:47.579]  Absolutely insane.
[00:54:47.579 --> 00:55:00.369]  The biggest house in the US, she's got a whole other one almost as big, and she sits there arrogantly, arrogantly, getting in our face, telling us that she's not spoiled, she's privileged.
[00:55:00.369 --> 00:55:02.330]  Yeah, you're more than privileged.
[00:55:02.330 --> 00:55:07.874]  German prosecutors have alleged for the first time that Bernie Ecclestone,
[00:55:08.948 --> 00:55:23.393]  And a trust belonging to the head of the Formula One family, yeah, because they don't pay jack squat in taxes, a trust, that's how they all run a tax-free trust, paid almost 44 million in bribes, that's 27 million pounds, to a German banker.
[00:55:23.393 --> 00:55:33.957]  In return, they allege, Ecclestone received 41.4 million in commissions from Bayron LB, the German bank, while a family trust company was paid 25 mil.
[00:55:33.957 --> 00:55:37.899]  State prosecutors in Munich said Tuesday they have charged
[00:55:38.939 --> 00:55:45.545]  Gerhard Geborowski, the German banker who organized the sale of the F-1 in 2005.
[00:55:45.545 --> 00:55:49.428]  Yeah, all the taxpayer paid for.
[00:55:49.428 --> 00:55:54.872]  And this is what I have to put up with, is a, you know what, our city council isn't even that corrupt.
[00:55:54.872 --> 00:55:58.875]  Though, this guy is reportedly known for greasing the skids, if you know what I mean.
[00:55:58.875 --> 00:56:03.519]  They're just a bunch of social-climbing, low-IQ, knuckle-draggers.
[00:56:04.591 --> 00:56:10.235]  Who just sit up there and it's gonna be good for jobs, it's gonna be great.
[00:56:10.235 --> 00:56:15.459]  Hey, Formula One makes such fabulous profits, you pay for it.
[00:56:15.459 --> 00:56:28.829]  It is immoral to take my tax money at the city and state level, from property taxes, education funds, you name it, and pump it into a guy who gave his daughter last year as a gift $4 billion.
[00:56:31.391 --> 00:56:33.333]  Oh, I know.
[00:56:33.333 --> 00:56:36.475]  You've decided it's a good idea, you little control freaks.
[00:56:36.475 --> 00:56:44.821]  But if I came to your house and tried to come in and take one of your video games away, you would physically assault me.
[00:56:44.821 --> 00:56:52.047]  If I tried to eat a bologna sandwich out of your refrigerator, you'd call the cops and want me arrested.
[00:56:52.047 --> 00:56:53.448]  But you want to come take
[00:56:55.054 --> 00:56:56.355]  Money out of my bank accounts.
[00:56:56.355 --> 00:57:04.863]  You want to destroy my capacity to own property through your stinking property tax to pay for Bernie Ecclestone's garbage.
[00:57:04.863 --> 00:57:06.624]  So, you want to know about the debt limit?
[00:57:06.624 --> 00:57:07.925]  That's what it's all about.
[00:57:07.925 --> 00:57:09.527]  That's what's going on with the debt limit.
[00:57:09.527 --> 00:57:12.810]  It's all just rearranging chairs on the deck of the Titanic.
[00:57:12.810 --> 00:57:15.772]  They've already positioned this country in a total bankruptcy.
[00:57:15.772 --> 00:57:21.697]  They already trained you that the government makes the sun rise and the grass grow and the sheep baa, baa.
[00:57:23.140 --> 00:57:25.061]  They've already got most of you on their payroll.
[00:57:25.061 --> 00:57:29.042]  They're already jacking your water with fluoride, your vaccines with cancer viruses.
[00:57:29.042 --> 00:57:35.324]  And they're just getting started with the big mega families running government and gang raping all of us.
[00:57:35.324 --> 00:57:40.745]  We ought to get smart and get together with a basic code of liberty to block these criminals from robbing us.
[00:57:40.745 --> 00:57:41.585]  But you know what?
[00:57:41.585 --> 00:57:44.026]  People won't admit they're being ripped off.
[00:57:44.026 --> 00:57:45.707]  So, we're going to be completely robbed.
[00:57:45.707 --> 00:57:46.947]  Stay with us, second hour coming up.
[00:57:51.206 --> 00:58:06.670]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:58:06.670 --> 00:58:10.351]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:58:11.365 --> 00:58:24.139]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:58:24.139 --> 00:58:31.407]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:58:32.088 --> 00:58:42.452]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:58:42.452 --> 00:58:46.394]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:58:46.394 --> 00:58:49.135]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:58:51.277 --> 00:58:52.979]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:52.979 --> 00:58:58.285]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:58:58.285 --> 00:58:59.827]  Saving means to make money.
[00:58:59.827 --> 00:59:08.617]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:59:09.338 --> 00:59:16.883]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:59:16.883 --> 00:59:24.888]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:59:24.888 --> 00:59:30.111]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[00:59:30.111 --> 00:59:32.272]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:59:35.014 --> 00:59:35.955]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[00:59:35.955 --> 00:59:38.417]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:00:01.812 --> 01:00:08.434]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:08.434 --> 01:00:11.494]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:11.494 --> 01:00:16.976]  Alright, it's hour number two.
[01:00:16.976 --> 01:00:19.896]  And I want to go to your phone calls.
[01:00:19.896 --> 01:00:22.717]  I want to get your take on all the different issues I've been talking about.
[01:00:24.301 --> 01:00:30.712]  And I want to hear what you have to say about the so-called debt ceiling, which really is rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.
[01:00:30.712 --> 01:00:31.614]  I want to get your view.
[01:00:33.431 --> 01:00:36.132]  On the fact that, I mean, is my message getting out?
[01:00:36.132 --> 01:00:37.172]  Do you understand what I'm saying?
[01:00:37.172 --> 01:00:51.337]  That the big mega fortunes all are making their money out of sweetheart inside deals with government or corporate welfare or exemption from taxes they lobby for across the board to shut down their competition.
[01:00:51.337 --> 01:00:54.758]  I mean, is that message telegraphing out there to the people?
[01:00:54.758 --> 01:00:55.538]  I want to hear from you.
[01:00:56.098 --> 01:00:57.618]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-ALEX.
[01:00:57.618 --> 01:00:57.718]  877-789-2539.
[01:00:57.718 --> 01:00:58.159]  Again, 877-789-A-L-E-X.
[01:00:58.159 --> 01:01:00.019]  And we'll get you up and on the air.
[01:01:00.019 --> 01:01:03.080]  Coming up in the next segment, we'll take a battery of calls or two.
[01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:03.300]  And then...
[01:01:16.408 --> 01:01:18.730]  I will get more into the debt ceiling itself.
[01:01:18.730 --> 01:01:21.112]  I can do that briefly on the other side and then go to your calls.
[01:01:21.112 --> 01:01:29.538]  And then I'm going to get into the ATF article that went up Friday and should be one of the biggest articles that we've ever put out, but of course it isn't.
[01:01:29.538 --> 01:01:34.983]  Sometimes I'll put out some article that's important but nothing compared to this and it gets read by 5 million people in a week.
[01:01:35.763 --> 01:01:38.866]  And, you know, is the number one story on the web or in the top ten.
[01:01:38.866 --> 01:01:55.302]  And then something like this, so big, so obvious, so clear, so brazen, so naked, so out in the open, so absolutely outrageous, exclusive ATF intimidates gun owners with home visits.
[01:01:56.850 --> 01:02:04.193]  And it gets into our sources that talk to the ATF here in Austin and other issues and Fast and Furious and all of it.
[01:02:04.193 --> 01:02:08.255]  That is going to be coming up after I go through some of your phone calls this evening.
[01:02:09.861 --> 01:02:19.224]  And of course, the gun grabbers who've been publicly caught shipping the guns into Mexico are now exploiting all this to try to pass more victim disarmament.
[01:02:19.224 --> 01:02:21.364]  Well, they're total Chicago mob types.
[01:02:21.364 --> 01:02:25.145]  I mean, what on earth do you expect to happen from these people?
[01:02:25.145 --> 01:02:30.046]  The number one mission of a hardcore criminal is disarm the prey.
[01:02:30.046 --> 01:02:38.789]  That's why lions and tigers and bears, oh my, target creatures that are prey animals that don't have teeth and claws and don't attack back.
[01:02:39.793 --> 01:02:48.056]  That's why when you don't shoot a few mountain lions or a few grizzly bears or a few polar bears a year, they start coming into your town and eating you.
[01:02:48.056 --> 01:02:51.558]  And we've allowed government to act just like that.
[01:02:51.558 --> 01:02:56.580]  And we've got grizzly bears living inside our houses telling us, give them more, more, more.
[01:02:56.580 --> 01:03:00.522]  70% on average or more isn't enough.
[01:03:00.522 --> 01:03:01.202]  And I've had it!
[01:03:02.734 --> 01:03:15.663]  It's time for good people to have a code of liberty and freedom, and not put up with thugs and bullies pushing them around, and to explode in their face every time they get in your face, and then we'll get back to a system of great wealth.
[01:03:15.663 --> 01:03:25.230]  But you know, it's gotta go through the total collapse first, because we had the liberty so long, we became fat, dumb, and happy, myself included.
[01:03:25.230 --> 01:03:30.633]  And we're tortured by the brainwashing, the stuff on the television.
[01:03:31.624 --> 01:03:40.211]  Our psyches are turned inside out and we're poisoned by the GMO.
[01:03:40.211 --> 01:03:43.554]  By all the rest of it.
[01:03:43.554 --> 01:03:47.837]  And so we're going to be going over all of that after the break as well.
[01:03:47.837 --> 01:03:50.560]  And I've got a few other little snivelets of news here.
[01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:56.985]  I haven't even gotten into all the incredible military news that's in this stack right here.
[01:03:56.985 --> 01:03:59.327]  Let me just give you a rundown of that.
[01:04:00.037 --> 01:04:06.080]  Rebel militia confirmed guilty of assassination of General Yonez.
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:08.882]  Turns out one rival Al-Qaeda group run by the U.S.
[01:04:08.882 --> 01:04:11.143]  and Europe killed the other Al-Qaeda group.
[01:04:11.143 --> 01:04:16.926]  Something our researchers have been in Tripoli reported over a month and a half ago.
[01:04:16.926 --> 01:04:24.531]  But Al-Qaeda is fighting with itself over who gets the hundreds of billions in oil money in Libya and the 10 billion in gold.
[01:04:24.531 --> 01:04:28.032]  Also, Libyan rebel leader killed by allied militia.
[01:04:28.032 --> 01:04:28.833]  That's another headline.
[01:04:30.123 --> 01:04:30.543]  Here's one.
[01:04:30.543 --> 01:04:33.706]  Libyan TV still on air despite NATO bombing.
[01:04:33.706 --> 01:04:38.830]  When NATO bombed it, dropping three missiles on it, they called it terror broadcast.
[01:04:38.830 --> 01:04:41.453]  Now a country's TV is terrorism.
[01:04:41.453 --> 01:04:44.495]  Even broadcasting against the occupation is evil.
[01:04:44.495 --> 01:04:47.218]  Can you believe we've been bombing them for four months and they got TV on?
[01:04:47.218 --> 01:04:49.099]  It's terror!
[01:04:49.099 --> 01:04:50.901]  They got a TV transmission!
[01:04:50.901 --> 01:04:54.284]  Syria army kills 80 people storming Hama.
[01:04:54.284 --> 01:04:55.705]  I'm against that.
[01:04:55.705 --> 01:04:57.967]  But I'm also against Israel mowing all those folks down a month ago.
[01:04:59.392 --> 01:05:00.572]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:05:00.572 --> 01:05:07.493]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:05:07.493 --> 01:05:10.054]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:05:10.054 --> 01:05:15.435]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:05:15.435 --> 01:05:18.475]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:05:18.475 --> 01:05:20.796]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:05:20.796 --> 01:05:27.037]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:05:27.037 --> 01:05:27.457]  In fact,
[01:05:27.757 --> 01:05:30.419]  Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:05:30.419 --> 01:05:36.182]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:05:36.182 --> 01:05:37.843]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:05:37.843 --> 01:05:39.144]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:05:39.144 --> 01:05:41.805]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:05:41.805 --> 01:05:46.027]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:05:46.027 --> 01:05:48.629]  You can find the video at www.barron.com.
[01:05:48.829 --> 01:05:50.650]  End of America 3 dot com.
[01:05:50.650 --> 01:05:51.771]  That's End of America.
[01:05:51.771 --> 01:05:53.232]  The number 3 dot com.
[01:05:53.232 --> 01:05:57.094]  Watch the free video at www dot End of America 3 dot com.
[01:05:57.094 --> 01:06:09.102]  That's End of America 3 dot com.
[01:06:09.102 --> 01:06:10.943]  We are on the march.
[01:06:10.943 --> 01:06:14.085]  The empire is on the run.
[01:06:14.085 --> 01:06:17.808]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:31.098 --> 01:06:33.180]  Hey, little bankers, what have you done?
[01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:46.216]  You created 1.5 quadrillion in derivatives, you sold them to everybody to buy up the planet through fraud, and now you're setting up Northcom Marshall Law Power in case the American people don't want to go into debt slavery for you.
[01:06:47.932 --> 01:06:49.633]  But don't worry.
[01:06:49.633 --> 01:06:51.634]  You got the shotgun.
[01:06:51.634 --> 01:06:53.915]  And the general public can't figure this out.
[01:06:53.915 --> 01:06:57.858]  So there's a good chance your gang raping's never gonna stop.
[01:06:57.858 --> 01:07:03.421]  People like it when Stalin kills 60 million, Mao 60-plus million, Hitler tens of millions.
[01:07:04.281 --> 01:07:10.627]  Folks still mind the government when they're marched into trenches and shot with their babies in their arms.
[01:07:10.627 --> 01:07:13.369]  Because those people aren't conspiracy theorists.
[01:07:13.369 --> 01:07:14.850]  They're conformists.
[01:07:14.850 --> 01:07:17.232]  Well, not Alex Jones!
[01:07:17.232 --> 01:07:18.473]  Not me!
[01:07:18.473 --> 01:07:21.696]  When you got Bernie Ecclestone...
[01:07:22.677 --> 01:07:29.161]  With more than 50 Formula One tracks, every one of them paid for with taxpayer money, exempt from taxes.
[01:07:29.161 --> 01:07:35.906]  And his daughter given $4 billion last year, lovingly, by Mr. Carleone.
[01:07:35.906 --> 01:07:42.650]  And here in Austin, they're having basically the whole track still paid for by taxpayers, tax-exempt, total raping.
[01:07:42.650 --> 01:07:45.552]  If you won't sell your property, they're just going to take it eminent domain.
[01:07:45.552 --> 01:07:49.255]  And the city council, it won't matter if Ecclestone gets arrested.
[01:07:49.255 --> 01:07:52.157]  His banker's been arrested and the Germans say he was involved in the fraud.
[01:07:53.218 --> 01:07:58.902]  The city council will call for the German government's arrest before they say a word.
[01:07:58.902 --> 01:08:01.924]  My money goes to Ecclestone, period!
[01:08:01.924 --> 01:08:05.046]  And if I don't like it, the Austin SWAT team's standing by.
[01:08:05.046 --> 01:08:09.049]  Okay, I said I was going to settle down.
[01:08:10.063 --> 01:08:19.088]  You know, I was going to come in here and talk about your stupid media reporting on the debt limit, the debt limit, everything.
[01:08:19.088 --> 01:08:23.210]  You'd think that birds wouldn't sing and grass wouldn't grow.
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:33.683]  And that, you know, mama, mama, mama couldn't make pancakes in the morning if it wasn't for government.
[01:08:33.683 --> 01:08:35.403]  Government, government, government.
[01:08:35.403 --> 01:08:40.044]  Every channel, the government, the bankers, our debt limit, the bankers.
[01:08:40.044 --> 01:08:46.666]  We're all being taught, just like in third world countries where they're obsessed with currency, value, and debt limits.
[01:08:46.666 --> 01:08:51.387]  We've been maneuvered by a criminal class, a criminal political class.
[01:08:51.387 --> 01:08:52.808]  It's self-owned by foreign banks.
[01:08:53.851 --> 01:09:11.947]  We've been maneuvered now to the position where we're being told just keep raising taxes forever, while you cut the services, and pay everything to the offshore banks that set this fraud up, who you don't owe the money to, or you'll have a total collapse and lose your debt rating.
[01:09:11.947 --> 01:09:21.116]  And as Ron Paul has said, and many others, economist Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former head of the Treasury, and many others have said, it is all a distraction.
[01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:36.803]  The foreign banks, the big six that have taken over this country through their beachhead, the Federal Reserve, in 1913, created, and even the Washington Post reports this, 1,500 trillion in derivatives, and that was a year ago.
[01:09:36.803 --> 01:09:38.824]  The numbers are bigger now.
[01:09:38.824 --> 01:09:42.224]  It's a debt black hole, hundreds of times all the wealth in the world.
[01:09:42.224 --> 01:09:43.825]  You cannot pay it back.
[01:09:43.825 --> 01:09:44.845]  It is a total fraud.
[01:09:46.667 --> 01:09:51.568]  All the assets, all the taxes, all the everything in the entire U.S.
[01:09:51.568 --> 01:09:53.609]  isn't even $100 trillion.
[01:09:53.609 --> 01:10:00.751]  And we're told we owe these bankers $640 plus trillion, Washington Post.
[01:10:00.751 --> 01:10:05.072]  That is, last number I saw, $500 and something thousand per family.
[01:10:06.738 --> 01:10:08.679]  That's if you average everybody together.
[01:10:08.679 --> 01:10:21.846]  You got 70-something million on Social Security, 49 million on food stamps, another 30 million on full welfare, another large portion, different numbers that are out there on government contracts.
[01:10:21.846 --> 01:10:28.729]  So, two-thirds of the country are on the government mammary gland.
[01:10:28.729 --> 01:10:33.312]  And they're looking at the other one-third of us and going, get ready, we're going to butcher you.
[01:10:34.668 --> 01:10:39.953]  And it's kind of like Abel selling his inheritance for a bowl of porridge.
[01:10:39.953 --> 01:10:46.459]  If the middle class doesn't get together and say, look, look here, you can do the numbers that they've done the numbers.
[01:10:46.459 --> 01:10:51.824]  If they took all the middle class's money, it wouldn't pay for one trillion dollars.
[01:10:51.824 --> 01:10:53.666]  It's less than one trillion.
[01:10:53.666 --> 01:10:54.747]  Nine hundred something billion.
[01:10:54.747 --> 01:10:55.568]  You pull that number up.
[01:11:01.530 --> 01:11:05.712]  Folks, it is time for people to realize this.
[01:11:05.712 --> 01:11:07.133]  There is no paying it off.
[01:11:07.133 --> 01:11:09.054]  There is no debt limit.
[01:11:09.054 --> 01:11:11.176]  Raise it, don't raise it.
[01:11:11.176 --> 01:11:22.422]  If the Republicans came out and said, arrest the head of the Federal Reserve, arrest the private families for fraud, as the Senate committee's already found with the derivatives they sold government, private industry, you name it, individuals.
[01:11:22.422 --> 01:11:24.923]  If they don't talk like that, none of this matters.
[01:11:24.923 --> 01:11:27.405]  They're debating government's $14.5 trillion that's a current
[01:11:30.495 --> 01:11:31.035]  Hangover?
[01:11:31.035 --> 01:11:44.044]  They're not talking that under Too Big to Fail, we were legally bound under law to 600 plus trillion dollars of the quote U.S.
[01:11:44.044 --> 01:11:47.126]  share of the 1.5 quadrillion worldwide.
[01:11:48.416 --> 01:12:13.251]  So, no, I'm not going to talk about and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and
[01:12:13.951 --> 01:12:17.257]  You've been signed on to banker fraud!
[01:12:17.257 --> 01:12:24.929]  These bankers, since 1913, are able to loan out, for every dollar you go down and deposit in their little stinking bank, they can loan out $10.
[01:12:27.489 --> 01:12:37.437]  And when do those bankers, quote, make wealth, make money, because they just issue the printed garbage and the digital garbage, when you don't pay off the farm, when you don't pay off the house?
[01:12:37.437 --> 01:12:42.901]  They get the down payments, they get all the investment, they get the interest, and then they flip it and sell it again.
[01:12:42.901 --> 01:12:45.423]  So, what do bankers, big bankers, want?
[01:12:45.423 --> 01:12:47.525]  They like depressions!
[01:12:47.525 --> 01:12:52.849]  And it's the congressional record they engineered, the 1929 crash, on record.
[01:12:52.849 --> 01:12:54.471]  You want to go read the Senators' quotes?
[01:12:55.506 --> 01:12:59.511]  You want to go read all of them from Lindbergh and McFadden?
[01:12:59.511 --> 01:13:05.358]  Believe me, I'm somebody... See, while you're reading about football, or while you're reading about...
[01:13:06.260 --> 01:13:32.306]  You know, what bar to pick up chicks, or while you're reading about the latest cosmetics, whatever you're into, while you're reading about, you know, cheat sheets to hack World of Warcraft or Halo or whatever it's called, while you're doing that, I'm reading Rockefeller Foundation documents that are public and posting them on InfoWars.com where they talk about putting cancer viruses in vaccines and then I find out those very cancers have been found, the cancer viruses.
[01:13:33.655 --> 01:13:37.717]  In the vaccines, and then I learned that they've learned how to engineer steroids into the vaccines.
[01:13:37.717 --> 01:13:39.277]  I kind of get mad about that.
[01:13:39.277 --> 01:13:43.179]  There's a creepy group running the government that's jacking the food and water.
[01:13:43.179 --> 01:13:44.519]  I'm a weirdo, you know?
[01:13:44.519 --> 01:13:46.660]  I mean, I'm a fruitcake.
[01:13:46.660 --> 01:13:48.340]  I'm a lunatic.
[01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:53.782]  I read about some gangster guy overseas coming into Austin, want me to pay for his Formula One track.
[01:13:53.782 --> 01:13:55.263]  Here he is, his banker indicted.
[01:13:55.263 --> 01:13:57.284]  The Germans say they're set to indict him.
[01:13:57.284 --> 01:14:00.145]  You know, told you a year ago the guy was
[01:14:01.790 --> 01:14:02.831]  Definitely a scammer.
[01:14:02.831 --> 01:14:09.718]  It's a scam to come into Austin and lobby my little dirtbag politicians to take my tax money and give it to him over in Europe.
[01:14:09.718 --> 01:14:13.962]  So his daughter can have 50... how many thousand square feet was her house?
[01:14:13.962 --> 01:14:16.365]  You finally got the number?
[01:14:16.365 --> 01:14:20.149]  56,000 square feet if you don't count the helicopter pads and facility.
[01:14:21.471 --> 01:14:22.031]  And great!
[01:14:22.031 --> 01:14:23.492]  Have it all day, lady!
[01:14:23.492 --> 01:14:32.318]  But don't you go around and have your think tanks tell all the poor, dumbed-down people, hey, let's get the rich guys that make $125,000 a year.
[01:14:32.318 --> 01:14:33.279]  Man, they're rich!
[01:14:33.279 --> 01:14:37.462]  Let's raise their taxes so you can suck it out of the country through your corporate welfare.
[01:14:37.462 --> 01:14:38.643]  Get out of my life!
[01:14:38.643 --> 01:14:39.883]  Stop usurping me!
[01:14:39.883 --> 01:14:41.224]  Stop trying to control me!
[01:14:41.224 --> 01:14:42.205]  I'm sick of you!
[01:14:42.205 --> 01:14:43.906]  I see you!
[01:14:43.906 --> 01:14:44.887]  I hate you!
[01:14:44.887 --> 01:14:46.908]  I hate you so much!
[01:14:46.908 --> 01:14:51.391]  I don't even care what happens to me because I've got the spirit of rebellion against
[01:14:51.452 --> 01:14:52.120]  There's tyranny in me.
[01:14:53.098 --> 01:14:59.981]  I have a spirit of love of God and submitting to God's commandments of good and decent things.
[01:14:59.981 --> 01:15:22.089]  And I have a spirit of 110% total rocket-fueled hatred and rebellion against pot-bellied scumbags that get together in societies of conmen and crooks and turn us into an effeminate, degenerate, hunchback society, bowing down and licking your hands, and I will not be part of it anymore!
[01:15:23.766 --> 01:15:26.648]  I will see all of the globalists arrested.
[01:15:26.648 --> 01:15:31.691]  I will see them hauled up and tried by juries of their peers.
[01:15:31.691 --> 01:15:35.053]  And then you know what comes after that.
[01:15:35.053 --> 01:15:36.534]  And you think this is it.
[01:15:36.534 --> 01:15:38.755]  Oh my honey, listen to this crazy guy.
[01:15:38.755 --> 01:15:40.756]  I know you said that to your wife driving on the road.
[01:15:40.756 --> 01:15:41.417]  This is what
[01:15:42.739 --> 01:15:46.203]  A common sense person being usurped and enslaved sounds like.
[01:15:46.203 --> 01:15:50.187]  You know, you find somebody breaking into your house, robbing you, don't you get mad?
[01:15:50.187 --> 01:15:51.708]  You have a sense of outrage?
[01:15:51.708 --> 01:15:53.230]  Of trespass?
[01:15:53.230 --> 01:15:57.514]  But why is it when big, giant, powerful people rape you, you lay down?
[01:15:57.514 --> 01:15:59.036]  Because you feel powerless.
[01:15:59.036 --> 01:15:59.797]  So you bend over!
[01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:04.163]  Hi, this is Steve Shank and Babs Rosberg with eFoods Direct.
[01:16:04.163 --> 01:16:11.931]  Babs, you work a lot with shipping and things are going absolutely nuts with this new Independence Month Patriot Pack that eFoods is giving away.
[01:16:11.931 --> 01:16:16.115]  The way things are going, we're shipping thousands of these great little Patriot Packs out.
[01:16:16.115 --> 01:16:20.299]  Just an example, Sherry from Arkansas made a $1,300 order.
[01:16:20.299 --> 01:16:22.801]  We shipped her five free Patriot Packs, $750 more free food.
[01:16:25.123 --> 01:16:28.425]  Folks are really surprised at what we're actually giving away.
[01:16:28.425 --> 01:16:35.270]  Now folks, we've had 235 years of freedom in this country, so for every $235 worth of food ordered, we give away a $149 Patriot Pack free.
[01:16:35.270 --> 01:16:39.373]  To order the best food on the planet, call 800-409-5633 or go to efoodsdirect.com slash alex.
[01:16:48.556 --> 01:16:51.779]  A free 12-day supply Patriot Pack with every $235 worth of food ordered.
[01:16:51.779 --> 01:16:52.860]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com slash alex
[01:17:01.627 --> 01:17:05.651]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:17:05.651 --> 01:17:08.895]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:17:08.895 --> 01:17:13.700]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:20.087]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:17:20.087 --> 01:17:22.330]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:17:22.850 --> 01:17:23.851]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:17:23.851 --> 01:17:24.571]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:17:24.571 --> 01:17:26.472]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:17:41.761 --> 01:17:43.904]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:17:43.904 --> 01:17:49.050]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:17:49.050 --> 01:17:58.160]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:18:01.365 --> 01:18:03.066]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:18:03.066 --> 01:18:08.368]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:18:08.368 --> 01:18:09.908]  Saving means to make money.
[01:18:09.908 --> 01:18:18.692]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:18:19.432 --> 01:18:26.974]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:18:26.974 --> 01:18:34.977]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:18:34.977 --> 01:18:42.359]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you've had to do something you've never done before, getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:18:45.140 --> 01:18:48.363]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[01:18:48.363 --> 01:18:50.725]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:18:50.725 --> 01:18:52.847]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[01:18:59.926 --> 01:19:04.469]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:19:04.469 --> 01:19:05.389]  Number one.
[01:19:05.389 --> 01:19:08.812]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:19:08.812 --> 01:19:09.672]  Number two.
[01:19:09.672 --> 01:19:14.555]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:19:14.555 --> 01:19:15.316]  It's true.
[01:19:15.316 --> 01:19:20.179]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:19:20.179 --> 01:19:20.999]  Number three.
[01:19:20.999 --> 01:19:24.602]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:19:24.602 --> 01:19:28.284]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:19:28.504 --> 01:19:29.285]  Number 4.
[01:19:29.285 --> 01:19:32.048]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:19:32.048 --> 01:19:35.732]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:19:35.732 --> 01:19:36.533]  Number 5.
[01:19:36.533 --> 01:19:40.678]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:19:40.678 --> 01:19:45.443]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:19:45.723 --> 01:19:46.964]  You know, that's what's frustrating.
[01:20:16.098 --> 01:20:24.099]  Is that even when you're aware of corruption and aren't naive and fight it, history shows, as Thomas Everson said, you still pretty much get run over and defeated.
[01:20:26.198 --> 01:20:31.041]  And so many Americans think it's cute to defend corruption or deny it's there.
[01:20:31.041 --> 01:20:42.267]  And now we see all of our liberties, all of our wealth, all of our blessings draining out like a man who's had his legs cut off and blood's just spraying out, pumping out.
[01:20:42.267 --> 01:20:44.769]  He'll be in shock in 30 seconds.
[01:20:44.769 --> 01:20:46.429]  He'll be dead in two minutes.
[01:20:46.429 --> 01:20:52.413]  And the guy looks at you as the blood's spraying out of his chopped off legs and says, don't put tourniquets on me, conspiracy theorist.
[01:20:53.698 --> 01:20:55.159]  It just blows the mind.
[01:20:55.159 --> 01:21:00.903]  Peter, Keith, Link, Steven, Jerry, Greg, Richard, Timothy, Alan, Garfield, Colonel Sick, Carol.
[01:21:00.903 --> 01:21:01.983]  I'm gonna get to y'all.
[01:21:01.983 --> 01:21:04.185]  And I haven't even gotten into the ATF news.
[01:21:04.185 --> 01:21:09.068]  Outside of law, they're just restricting the Second Amendment now.
[01:21:09.068 --> 01:21:11.029]  I mean, you can't even make this up.
[01:21:11.029 --> 01:21:14.071]  And we have inside intel directly from ATF Austin.
[01:21:14.071 --> 01:21:15.692]  So I'll get to that in the last segment.
[01:21:17.318 --> 01:21:21.761]  The only piece of news I'm going to hit on the debt limit is they're saying they've got a deal hopefully in the next 48 hours.
[01:21:49.059 --> 01:22:05.249]  Oh, what Ron Paul told us months ago, what other economists told us years ago, I'm afraid even if you do go deeper into debt, you're going to lose the AAA rating.
[01:22:05.249 --> 01:22:08.791]  The AAA rating was gone over three years ago when they started monetizing debt.
[01:22:09.651 --> 01:22:14.857]  Over 75% of all the T-bills now are bought by the Federal Reserve.
[01:22:14.857 --> 01:22:17.000]  You're like, oh, the bankers are helping.
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:25.429]  Yeah, they buy them with fiat digital currency they make up that the taxpayer paid for, and then they buy real assets for themselves.
[01:22:25.429 --> 01:22:27.412]  Yes, they're really helping you.
[01:22:27.412 --> 01:22:29.794]  Oh, they're going to help you good, don't worry.
[01:22:30.575 --> 01:22:35.239]  Moody's and Essinpour's demand, 100% cuts of everything, all money paid to foreign bankers that scammed us.
[01:22:59.239 --> 01:23:01.020]  And new taxes.
[01:23:01.020 --> 01:23:03.902]  So they want higher taxes, everything cut, everything to them.
[01:23:03.902 --> 01:23:05.203]  And then that's not enough.
[01:23:05.203 --> 01:23:06.284]  Nothing's enough.
[01:23:06.284 --> 01:23:07.124]  Everything.
[01:23:07.124 --> 01:23:13.608]  Because every daughter of these people has to have 56,000 square foot homes with helicopter pads of stolen money.
[01:23:13.608 --> 01:23:20.593]  And they gotta hire mercenaries and armies and cops and all these major banks have got narcotics to launder.
[01:23:20.593 --> 01:23:26.637]  They're hardcore mafia, but they're wearing government outfits, so you literally say, take my daughter, take my wife, take it all.
[01:23:26.877 --> 01:23:28.938]  And so they're like, you bet we're going to take it all.
[01:23:28.938 --> 01:23:29.639]  You scum.
[01:23:29.639 --> 01:23:31.440]  And you're like, oh, please hurt me bad.
[01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:32.181]  They're like, we will.
[01:23:32.181 --> 01:23:32.881]  Don't worry.
[01:23:32.881 --> 01:23:34.322]  We're going to hurt you bad.
[01:23:34.322 --> 01:23:34.983]  You want it.
[01:23:34.983 --> 01:23:36.023]  You got it.
[01:23:36.023 --> 01:23:37.484]  We are going to hurt you bad.
[01:23:37.484 --> 01:23:39.606]  And you're like, yes, hurt me.
[01:23:39.606 --> 01:23:40.967]  Let's go to Peter in Florida.
[01:23:40.967 --> 01:23:42.728]  You know, I'm grieving for this country.
[01:23:43.228 --> 01:23:44.229]  That's why I'm so angry.
[01:23:44.229 --> 01:23:53.381]  I'm grieving that we have come to this point, like some crack whore with cigarette burns all over us, with a pimp beating us with a belly club and our brains oozing out, and we're still thanking him.
[01:23:53.381 --> 01:23:54.422]  Oh, baby, I'm sorry!
[01:23:54.422 --> 01:23:55.884]  Oh, baby, I'm sorry!
[01:23:55.884 --> 01:23:56.425]  And he's like...
[01:23:58.194 --> 01:24:00.396]  I'm sorry I'm hurting you, Billy Club!
[01:24:00.396 --> 01:24:02.137]  Peter, go ahead in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:24:02.137 --> 01:24:04.959]  Hey Alex, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[01:24:04.959 --> 01:24:17.607]  Listen, just recently I worked out at a gym here in Miami and I got to meet somebody who also works for the Department of Homeland Security and I just got to talking with him because he showed up in his giant truck with all the information.
[01:24:17.607 --> 01:24:23.852]  He was a banker protection enforcer, a bank rape helper, and what did the bank raper helper say?
[01:24:24.639 --> 01:24:35.987]  Well, I try not to go too heavy on him because I knew he was becoming a member at our very small gym and I was hoping maybe if I could get in with him I could get a lot of information but he just basically confirmed a ton of stuff that you're always talking about.
[01:24:35.987 --> 01:24:43.752]  Number one, he's head of one of 28 elite response task force teams where he runs the top
[01:24:44.933 --> 01:24:49.255]  We don't have FEMA camps, but we do have giant facilities where we lock up hundreds of thousands per city for political reasons.
[01:24:49.255 --> 01:24:52.077]  Yes, we do have those, but they're not camps.
[01:25:11.806 --> 01:25:14.848]  He confirmed, yeah, we don't respond to any local authority.
[01:25:14.848 --> 01:25:17.089]  We respond only to federal authority.
[01:25:17.089 --> 01:25:18.369]  And he was kind of bragging.
[01:25:18.369 --> 01:25:21.711]  He's like, I pimp the cops, I run the local chiefs.
[01:25:21.711 --> 01:25:22.411]  It was so funny.
[01:25:22.411 --> 01:25:24.332]  It was so funny.
[01:25:24.332 --> 01:25:27.894]  I was coming at it as if, I was like, wow, I'm so interested.
[01:25:27.894 --> 01:25:29.615]  Tell me more about your job, just so he wouldn't.
[01:25:29.615 --> 01:25:31.496]  Tell me about your power.
[01:25:32.476 --> 01:25:35.899]  Exactly, but then he was more forthcoming with the information.
[01:25:35.899 --> 01:25:37.240]  And he confirmed that.
[01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:38.882]  He confirmed that they're preparing.
[01:25:38.882 --> 01:25:41.504]  They're not concerned about Al-Qaeda anymore, he said.
[01:25:41.504 --> 01:25:45.788]  And that morning, actually, CNN put out a piece about how Al-Qaeda's in the race.
[01:25:45.788 --> 01:25:47.930]  He's worried about those that don't like the bankers?
[01:25:49.090 --> 01:25:51.491]  I specifically said, did you see the MIAC report?
[01:25:51.491 --> 01:25:59.833]  And he, again, didn't really know it by name, but when I started discussing things like, you know, gun owners, returning veterans, like, yeah, we're really concerned about that.
[01:25:59.833 --> 01:26:03.014]  We're really concerned about a new anthrax attack, is what he said.
[01:26:03.014 --> 01:26:05.775]  Oh yeah, which was publicly run by the government, now admitted.
[01:26:07.905 --> 01:26:12.609]  Just tell him to drink more fluoride, give himself lots of vaccine shots, because he loves the government.
[01:26:12.609 --> 01:26:13.889]  They're going to take good care of him.
[01:26:13.889 --> 01:26:15.711]  Don't worry, he'll get what he wants in the end.
[01:26:15.711 --> 01:26:17.172]  That's the good feeling about all this.
[01:26:17.172 --> 01:26:23.116]  No matter, they're bringing America down, burning, they're going to burn right down with it by their own hand.
[01:26:23.116 --> 01:26:25.838]  And he's on his power trip, so good for him.
[01:26:25.838 --> 01:26:26.939]  Oh, it's so good.
[01:26:26.939 --> 01:26:31.462]  Also, bankers can buy their daughters 56,000 square foot houses.
[01:26:31.462 --> 01:26:31.562]  Sorry.
[01:26:34.685 --> 01:26:46.255]  Let me also mention that I wanted to tell everybody who listens to you out there, that this time around, especially with the Ron Paul campaign, it is so easy to talk to people, it is so easy to walk up to people.
[01:26:46.255 --> 01:26:56.985]  No, because Ron Paul predicted everything, and he's been winning almost all the straw polls, so Fox News never mentions him, and mentions all the little, well they mention Al Gore's former chief of staff,
[01:26:59.267 --> 01:27:01.848]  The ultra-conservative Rick Perry.
[01:27:01.848 --> 01:27:04.050]  Next, they're going to tell me Bill Clinton's conservative.
[01:27:04.050 --> 01:27:05.690]  And of course, the average moron conservative.
[01:27:05.690 --> 01:27:07.771]  I get emails going, he didn't work for Al Gore.
[01:27:07.771 --> 01:27:09.292]  Okay, scumbag!
[01:27:09.292 --> 01:27:12.274]  If you don't want to go check that out for yourself, go ahead.
[01:27:12.274 --> 01:27:16.136]  And they'll talk about Mitt Romney, who wrote the healthcare bill.
[01:27:18.122 --> 01:27:19.703]  These conservatives are idiots.
[01:27:19.703 --> 01:27:20.784]  Oh, they love it.
[01:27:20.784 --> 01:27:21.204]  I'm sorry.
[01:27:21.204 --> 01:27:21.965]  I apologize.
[01:27:21.965 --> 01:27:23.166]  They just love bondage.
[01:27:23.166 --> 01:27:24.747]  They hate their wives, their children.
[01:27:24.747 --> 01:27:25.608]  They're cowards.
[01:27:25.608 --> 01:27:26.768]  They love the Incon.
[01:27:26.768 --> 01:27:27.349]  They love it.
[01:27:27.349 --> 01:27:28.169]  They're gonna get it.
[01:27:28.169 --> 01:27:28.750]  Don't worry.
[01:27:28.750 --> 01:27:30.471]  They're gonna get everything they want.
[01:27:31.758 --> 01:27:48.236]  Listen to this, I'm part of the Republican group down here in Miami and we have all the mayors and former Senator Lemieux came in the other day to talk to us and whereas before, myself and my brother were like let me not boast my Ron Paul support or whatever, this time around
[01:27:48.616 --> 01:27:49.797]  We are dominating it.
[01:27:49.797 --> 01:27:51.119]  We are dictating it.
[01:27:51.119 --> 01:27:53.481]  When they mention Rick Perry, we go, Al Gore.
[01:27:53.481 --> 01:27:55.724]  When they mention Mitt Romney, we go, Obamacare.
[01:27:55.724 --> 01:28:00.088]  And what I'm trying to tell people out there who are listening to you is, this is not the time to be shy anymore.
[01:28:00.088 --> 01:28:02.010]  And there's more of us out there than you think.
[01:28:02.010 --> 01:28:05.494]  And as soon as you open your mouth, you'll realize how many more people go, yeah, I agree.
[01:28:06.094 --> 01:28:22.927]  And they didn't want to be the first one to say it, so if you start saying things, be confident, be, you know, secure in what you're saying because you know you're right, you know there's information to back it up, and if there's one thing that we can learn from the way you run things, it's don't shy away from this stuff because you're going to end up being right and they'll come back to you.
[01:28:22.927 --> 01:28:24.148]  No, no, no, exactly.
[01:28:24.148 --> 01:28:30.553]  Look, look, 200 years ago, if government acted like it was acting now, people would be running around with torches and guns.
[01:28:31.113 --> 01:28:33.555]  I'm not even saying do that, because that's what they want.
[01:28:33.555 --> 01:28:38.018]  The point is, yelling and screaming is the minimum I can do here.
[01:28:38.018 --> 01:28:39.419]  And yes, I hyperventilate.
[01:28:39.419 --> 01:28:41.661]  Yes, I tell folks how I really feel.
[01:28:41.661 --> 01:28:45.904]  Because it's time to stop mincing words.
[01:28:45.904 --> 01:28:51.187]  These people running things are hardcore criminals.
[01:28:51.187 --> 01:28:54.350]  And it's time to completely wake up and call their bluff.
[01:28:54.350 --> 01:28:56.711]  And we've gotten to one call of 14 we're gonna get to.
[01:28:56.711 --> 01:28:58.192]  We'll come back, we'll write your calls.
[01:28:58.192 --> 01:28:58.713]  Get ready!
[01:29:01.038 --> 01:29:07.704]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:29:07.704 --> 01:29:12.848]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:29:12.848 --> 01:29:21.576]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:29:21.576 --> 01:29:25.640]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:27.601]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[01:29:39.716 --> 01:29:41.857]  We turned jeans inside out.
[01:29:41.857 --> 01:29:43.659]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:29:43.659 --> 01:29:46.541]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:29:46.541 --> 01:29:50.784]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[01:29:50.784 --> 01:29:53.165]  So you can ride all day with confidence.

[01:29:55.867 --> 01:29:57.448]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:29:57.448 --> 01:29:58.229]  Got it.
[01:29:58.229 --> 01:29:59.110]  Others don't.
[01:30:00.535 --> 01:30:04.459]  You may be arrested and or subject to public police action.
[01:30:04.459 --> 01:30:05.721]  Tyranny is here.
[01:30:05.721 --> 01:30:09.345]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:30:09.345 --> 01:30:11.888]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:30:11.888 --> 01:30:17.274]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:30:17.734 --> 01:30:24.419]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:30:24.419 --> 01:30:30.403]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:30:30.403 --> 01:30:34.086]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:30:34.566 --> 01:30:38.847]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:30:38.847 --> 01:30:44.789]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:30:44.789 --> 01:30:48.349]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:30:48.349 --> 01:30:50.330]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:30:50.330 --> 01:30:51.450]  It's here.

[01:31:24.733 --> 01:31:28.035]  Folks are really surprised at what we're actually giving away.
[01:31:28.035 --> 01:31:34.419]  Now folks, we've had 235 years of freedom in this country, so for every $235 worth of food ordered, we give away a $149 Patriot Pack free.

[01:31:48.183 --> 01:31:49.264]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:31:49.264 --> 01:31:53.388]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:31:53.388 --> 01:31:55.269]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:32:10.663 --> 01:32:16.046]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:32:16.046 --> 01:32:19.088]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:32:19.088 --> 01:32:21.410]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:32:21.410 --> 01:32:27.674]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:32:27.674 --> 01:32:31.056]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:32:31.056 --> 01:32:36.839]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:32:36.839 --> 01:32:38.480]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:39.601]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:32:39.761 --> 01:32:42.422]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:32:42.422 --> 01:32:46.645]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:32:46.645 --> 01:32:51.267]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[01:32:51.267 --> 01:32:53.869]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[01:33:01.393 --> 01:33:04.975]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[01:33:04.975 --> 01:33:08.176]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:33:19.025 --> 01:33:23.487]  The websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:33:23.487 --> 01:33:32.510]  I eat, sleep, drink, dream this information and it's so insanely obvious.
[01:33:32.510 --> 01:33:37.272]  It's so historically relevant and ridiculous.
[01:33:37.272 --> 01:33:38.312]  It's so criminal.
[01:33:40.143 --> 01:33:46.006]  All over the country, the feds face scan, license plate scan, police videotape you in public.
[01:33:46.006 --> 01:33:54.430]  But when you go videotape police, even from a hundred yards away in your own house, they come and beat you half to death, charge you.
[01:33:54.430 --> 01:33:56.171]  The kept jury sends you to prison.
[01:34:00.051 --> 01:34:06.514]  JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs get caught ripping off their investors publicly, nobody gets in trouble.
[01:34:06.514 --> 01:34:13.177]  Wachovia, Wells Fargo get caught laundering 300 plus billion dollars in drug money, nobody gets in trouble.
[01:34:13.177 --> 01:34:21.401]  I was reading new federal court rulings where even $3,000 cash at your house, the cops take it, the courts rule it's illegal.
[01:34:21.401 --> 01:34:24.983]  Doesn't matter if you even have the receipt from the bank, you're not allowed to keep
[01:34:26.050 --> 01:34:27.471]  Money at your house, prisoner.
[01:34:27.471 --> 01:34:30.994]  Not allowed to have a garden at your house, prisoner.
[01:34:30.994 --> 01:34:36.439]  You know, most Americans get down on their knees and they say, yes sir, boss, I'm a good little slave.
[01:34:36.439 --> 01:34:39.061]  And the New World Order says, okay, then I'm going to take even more of your rights.
[01:34:39.061 --> 01:34:41.022]  And they say, please take them.
[01:34:41.022 --> 01:34:41.843]  I trust you.
[01:34:41.843 --> 01:34:43.444]  I believe whatever you tell me.
[01:34:43.444 --> 01:34:45.806]  I'm a good little serf.
[01:34:45.806 --> 01:34:48.729]  And you're pessimistic if you don't like the dollar being devalued.
[01:34:48.729 --> 01:34:51.691]  You're pessimistic if you don't like them lying about all the wars.
[01:34:51.691 --> 01:34:52.512]  You're pessimistic.
[01:34:53.482 --> 01:35:00.388]  When you bend over and beg government to hurt you bad, then you're intelligent.
[01:35:00.388 --> 01:35:02.330]  Then you're good.
[01:35:02.330 --> 01:35:04.272]  Then you can be trusted.
[01:35:04.272 --> 01:35:07.034]  So take all your vaccines and be good little toadies.
[01:35:07.034 --> 01:35:08.555]  Play along.
[01:35:08.555 --> 01:35:10.497]  Toady up to the power.
[01:35:10.497 --> 01:35:15.341]  They know subconsciously most of you are cowards and are afraid.
[01:35:15.341 --> 01:35:18.124]  Most mainline new listeners are cowards and afraid.
[01:35:19.807 --> 01:35:22.370]  And they know you're deep down know exactly what's going on.
[01:35:22.370 --> 01:35:29.377]  You're scared to death and you just want to lick their boots and hope they don't stomp your brains out too hard.
[01:35:29.377 --> 01:35:34.082]  When you know history, you find out that's who these people like to stomp.
[01:35:34.082 --> 01:35:36.585]  Now I at least want to get to 12, 13 of these calls that are holding.
[01:35:37.304 --> 01:35:39.806]  I got a lot of other news I didn't even get to.
[01:35:39.806 --> 01:35:44.229]  Tomorrow on the main weekday show, because we're going to have a special report completed by then.
[01:35:44.229 --> 01:35:48.312]  Aaron's up here working on Sonny to get it done with all the different video clips and documents and proof.
[01:35:48.312 --> 01:35:56.217]  But you heard about the ATF saying, well, if you sell two or more rifles to somebody, call the police on them.
[01:35:56.217 --> 01:35:57.458]  In fact, call the ATF on them.
[01:35:57.458 --> 01:36:01.761]  You got to fill out this big form and got to call them and got to become our confidential informant.
[01:36:01.761 --> 01:36:05.464]  Doesn't matter that whenever you buy a gun, there's an incident check done, a background check, and
[01:36:06.618 --> 01:36:11.609]  What type of firearm, rifle, shotgun, handgun you're buying.
[01:36:11.609 --> 01:36:15.097]  It's just about, we tell you to do things now that aren't under law.
[01:36:15.097 --> 01:36:15.659]  And you do them.
[01:36:17.662 --> 01:36:21.405]  And of course, it's the ATF caught shipping close to 30,000 guns into Mexico.
[01:36:21.405 --> 01:36:27.711]  Now we learn drug gangs around the country to knock out the other drug gangs that aren't laundering their money through the big banks.
[01:36:27.711 --> 01:36:29.592]  You know, that's who runs the whole drug trade.
[01:36:29.592 --> 01:36:30.413]  It's on record now.
[01:36:30.413 --> 01:36:32.975]  They admit the Marines and Army grow the opium.
[01:36:32.975 --> 01:36:38.240]  Now, record levels come into your daughter's arm, your son's arm, but you know, it's for freedom.
[01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:43.064]  You're unpatriotic if you're against a Captain America, likes to deal narcotics, and if you're not for it, well, you're with al-Qaeda.
[01:36:44.229 --> 01:36:47.150]  But, actually Al-Qaeda is now our ally in Libya, I'm sorry.
[01:36:47.150 --> 01:36:50.611]  You're with George Washington, even worse.
[01:36:50.611 --> 01:36:52.371]  Worse than Al-Qaeda.
[01:36:52.371 --> 01:37:04.975]  But it turns out I talked to local gun dealers, several of them, and one of them called and talked to Daniel Jones, the head of the ATF here in Austin, who on record runs stings on gun shows with illegal aliens.
[01:37:06.503 --> 01:37:12.328]  Of course, the same agency, again, caught shipping guns into Mexico and then lying to Congress about it to then blame the Second Amendment.
[01:37:12.328 --> 01:37:13.149]  That was their plan.
[01:37:13.149 --> 01:37:14.390]  And they don't care they've been caught.
[01:37:14.390 --> 01:37:15.771]  That's the name of this.
[01:37:15.771 --> 01:37:23.617]  It's what they call it, chutzpah, arrogance, bravado, aplomb.
[01:37:23.617 --> 01:37:25.719]  They're still going ahead with outside of law.
[01:37:25.719 --> 01:37:29.882]  But when I talked to one gun dealer, he said he called
[01:37:32.751 --> 01:37:43.215]  Daniel Jones, the head of the ATF in Austin, two weeks before receiving the letter to ask about news reports that President Obama was going to order the investigation of citizens that bought two or more rifles.
[01:37:43.215 --> 01:37:50.737]  Agent Jones told him, quote, no, that law didn't pass and we can't enforce something that isn't law, so don't worry about it.
[01:37:50.737 --> 01:37:52.118]  Of course, the law didn't pass.
[01:37:52.118 --> 01:37:55.559]  We have a link to that in the Washington Post, but the ATF later enforced it anyway.
[01:37:55.559 --> 01:37:58.100]  So who needs Congress to launch wars?
[01:37:58.900 --> 01:38:08.582]  Obama's saying don't raise the debt ceiling, and he will invoke the catastrophic emergency clause that suspends Congress for six months.
[01:38:08.582 --> 01:38:14.663]  Oh, they'll still sit up there and fly around in their private jets and be exempt from all the laws they pass, but he'll just do what he wants.
[01:38:14.663 --> 01:38:22.405]  So, we'll be covering that more tomorrow here on the show for you.
[01:38:22.405 --> 01:38:24.345]  Let's go ahead and talk to Keith in California.
[01:38:24.345 --> 01:38:25.986]  Go ahead, Keith, you're on the air.
[01:38:25.986 --> 01:38:26.546]  Thanks for holding.
[01:38:28.729 --> 01:38:32.935]  Long time listener.
[01:38:32.935 --> 01:38:37.842]  Just sensitive issue with the taxation there on the property tax.
[01:38:37.842 --> 01:38:43.430]  I'm concerned, isn't Ron Paul a proponent of property tax though?
[01:38:45.367 --> 01:38:50.329]  Ron Paul said get rid of the income tax, get rid of the property tax from what I've seen him, so.
[01:38:50.329 --> 01:38:58.332]  But I think he said, when he's asked about it federally, he said there shouldn't be a federal property tax, but that it's a state's rights issue.
[01:38:58.332 --> 01:38:59.552]  Just like on abortion.
[01:38:59.552 --> 01:39:04.254]  See, that's the Constitution, so he's saying Constitution.
[01:39:04.254 --> 01:39:04.994]  Okay, good.
[01:39:04.994 --> 01:39:10.616]  Is there any information or books when property tax was established?
[01:39:10.616 --> 01:39:11.537]  Any history on that?
[01:39:11.537 --> 01:39:14.518]  Yeah, I've looked all over the internet and I've never been able to find anything.
[01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:23.105]  Now I've looked it up, just look, search history of property tax and there really wasn't a property tax until the last 70 years or so.
[01:39:23.105 --> 01:39:28.269]  And it started in mafia run places like Chicago, New York, places like that.
[01:39:28.269 --> 01:39:29.770]  Now we're totally mafia run.
[01:39:29.770 --> 01:39:30.731]  Keith, I appreciate your call.
[01:39:30.731 --> 01:39:32.712]  We're gonna move quick to get to everybody.
[01:39:32.712 --> 01:39:38.096]  Link in Missouri, then Steven, Jerry, Greg, Richard, Garfield, Colonel Six, and Carol.
[01:39:38.096 --> 01:39:41.438]  Go ahead, Link, you're on the air.
[01:39:43.038 --> 01:39:54.032]  Hey, uh, that whole Formula 1 scam, uh, reminds me of that Hart, Hart in Montana, where people were conned into believing their city would make a bunch of money.
[01:39:55.151 --> 01:39:58.913]  By that guy who said he had a private military police force.
[01:39:58.913 --> 01:39:59.754]  Well I went there.
[01:39:59.754 --> 01:40:07.398]  The local boss hogs, there's three of them, openly hired and they had a giant FEMA camp built by the feds.
[01:40:07.398 --> 01:40:08.739]  It was handed over to them.
[01:40:08.739 --> 01:40:16.943]  They openly hired some Eastern Europeans with fake police cars and started getting ready to throw everybody in it and literally take over the town.
[01:40:16.943 --> 01:40:19.145]  They were telling folks you're not allowed to have free speech here now.
[01:40:19.665 --> 01:40:23.388]  And that's happening in Quartzsite, it's happening in Oak Park, Michigan.
[01:40:23.388 --> 01:40:34.095]  I mean, when citizens start just bowing down to uniforms, you just show somebody a uniform, they literally fall down like it's the cross and say, you know, save me.
[01:40:34.095 --> 01:40:34.715]  That's what happens.
[01:40:34.715 --> 01:40:37.037]  But yes, good example.
[01:40:37.037 --> 01:40:43.101]  Yeah, they, uh, you know, they were all the citizens, they were like starting fights with you or something.
[01:40:43.101 --> 01:40:44.782]  They were like, we're going to make a bunch of money.
[01:40:45.814 --> 01:40:46.754]  Well, they did say that.
[01:40:46.754 --> 01:40:48.955]  That was some of the boss hogs ran up.
[01:40:48.955 --> 01:40:53.757]  I'd be in the street interviewing somebody and they'd run up and start getting in my face, going, we're going to make money off this.
[01:40:53.757 --> 01:40:58.458]  And then I was at a restaurant and somebody came over and I learned that was like the dad of one of the boss hogs.
[01:40:58.458 --> 01:40:59.779]  And they were like, it's our prison.
[01:40:59.779 --> 01:41:00.779]  We own the people.
[01:41:00.779 --> 01:41:03.760]  We're going to put them all in it.
[01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:06.961]  We don't need no certification to have police cars.
[01:41:06.961 --> 01:41:08.142]  We're going to do it.
[01:41:08.142 --> 01:41:09.662]  And that's actually happened in court site.
[01:41:09.662 --> 01:41:10.803]  The state said, absolutely.
[01:41:11.743 --> 01:41:17.767]  Now, if you just show up in a police car and declare yourself emperor, they just bow down now in America.
[01:41:17.767 --> 01:41:25.011]  Yeah, and the Serbian government told them to take off their coat of arms on their vehicles.
[01:41:25.011 --> 01:41:28.893]  Yeah, well, it was Serbian mercenaries and a bunch of ex-cons.
[01:41:28.893 --> 01:41:31.414]  Last time I heard, they moved on to run another town.
[01:41:31.414 --> 01:41:32.355]  I hear you, Link.
[01:41:32.355 --> 01:41:39.859]  But again, not trusting foreign Serbs with a giant FEMA camp running checkpoints, that's un-American.
[01:41:40.751 --> 01:41:50.736]  I mean, next you're going to tell me, Link, you don't like it that they were going to give that lady 93 days in jail for a tomato box on her own property even though there wasn't a law against it?
[01:41:50.736 --> 01:41:53.237]  You think prisoners can have tomato boxes?
[01:41:53.237 --> 01:41:55.318]  Folks, I want to apologize for sickos like Link.
[01:41:55.318 --> 01:41:56.458]  I mean, he is questioning.
[01:41:56.458 --> 01:41:57.579]  That's evil.
[01:41:57.579 --> 01:41:58.980]  Steven in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:41:58.980 --> 01:42:00.080]  Another sicko, I'm sure.
[01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:01.161]  Go ahead.
[01:42:01.161 --> 01:42:01.961]  Absolutely.
[01:42:01.961 --> 01:42:04.342]  An enchilada lover here in Austin, Alex.
[01:42:04.342 --> 01:42:05.203]  Great show.
[01:42:05.203 --> 01:42:05.903]  Welcome, my friend.
[01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:08.582]  Hey, I wanted to just tell you a real quick story.
[01:42:08.582 --> 01:42:16.909]  I know you don't like folks bragging on you on the air, and you're a pretty modest guy, but I wanted to share a real quick story with you that I thought you'd want to hear about.
[01:42:16.909 --> 01:42:24.215]  My wife and my daughter and I joined you guys at the Storm the Capitol rally that we had back here in Austin when it was four or five weeks ago.
[01:42:24.215 --> 01:42:26.217]  Yeah, we stormed it twice.
[01:42:26.217 --> 01:42:32.102]  Had some good effects, but still the feds prevailed.
[01:42:32.102 --> 01:42:33.623]  Start finishing your story, we'll come back to you.
[01:42:33.623 --> 01:42:33.884]  Go ahead.
[01:42:34.457 --> 01:42:37.178]  Okay, yeah, and Representative Simpson, of course, did a great job.
[01:42:37.178 --> 01:42:39.079]  We talked to him as well.
[01:42:39.079 --> 01:42:42.960]  We joined you at the Capitol, and I remember I was driving in from out of town to come meet you guys.
[01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:50.763]  My wife and my daughter are already there, and then fast forward a couple of weeks ago, and my wife and I were sitting visiting, and I said, honey, is Alex Jones for real?
[01:42:50.763 --> 01:42:57.866]  And she said, let me just tell you, if something had happened to me before you got there, I know that I could have given our daughter to him and said, take care of her until I get out of jail, so.
[01:42:57.866 --> 01:42:59.807]  Well, let me hear the rest of the story on the other side.
[01:43:00.467 --> 01:43:05.030]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:43:05.030 --> 01:43:05.931]  Number one.
[01:43:05.931 --> 01:43:09.354]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:43:09.354 --> 01:43:10.214]  Number two.
[01:43:10.214 --> 01:43:15.118]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:43:15.118 --> 01:43:15.858]  It's true.
[01:43:15.858 --> 01:43:20.742]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:43:20.742 --> 01:43:21.563]  Number three.
[01:43:21.563 --> 01:43:25.145]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:43:25.145 --> 01:43:28.848]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:43:29.048 --> 01:43:29.849]  Number 4.
[01:43:29.849 --> 01:43:32.612]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:43:32.612 --> 01:43:36.296]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:43:36.296 --> 01:43:37.076]  Number 5.
[01:43:37.076 --> 01:43:41.221]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:43:41.221 --> 01:43:45.986]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:43:46.266 --> 01:43:50.431]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:43:50.431 --> 01:43:52.233]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:43:52.233 --> 01:43:54.476]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:43:54.476 --> 01:43:56.839]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:44:01.525 --> 01:44:05.549]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:44:05.549 --> 01:44:08.793]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:44:08.793 --> 01:44:13.598]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:44:13.598 --> 01:44:19.985]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:44:19.985 --> 01:44:22.228]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:44:22.768 --> 01:44:23.068]  Tim Geithner?
[01:44:23.068 --> 01:44:23.568]  Bernanke?
[01:44:23.568 --> 01:44:24.189]  They're arsonists!
[01:44:24.189 --> 01:44:24.909]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:44:24.909 --> 01:44:27.030]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:44:41.656 --> 01:44:48.939]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:44:48.939 --> 01:44:58.042]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:45:01.994 --> 01:45:05.955]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:45:05.955 --> 01:45:14.816]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:45:14.816 --> 01:45:19.437]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:45:19.437 --> 01:45:30.259]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:45:30.899 --> 01:45:40.401]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:45:40.401 --> 01:45:45.843]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:45:45.843 --> 01:45:53.324]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:45:53.324 --> 01:45:55.725]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[01:46:00.049 --> 01:46:01.229]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:46:01.229 --> 01:46:08.172]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:46:08.172 --> 01:46:10.713]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:46:10.713 --> 01:46:16.095]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:46:16.095 --> 01:46:19.136]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:46:19.136 --> 01:46:21.197]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:46:21.457 --> 01:46:27.702]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:46:27.702 --> 01:46:31.084]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:46:31.084 --> 01:46:36.848]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:46:36.848 --> 01:46:38.509]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:46:38.509 --> 01:46:39.810]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:46:39.810 --> 01:46:42.472]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:46:42.472 --> 01:46:46.715]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:46:46.715 --> 01:46:49.277]  You can find the video at www dot
[01:46:49.497 --> 01:46:51.317]  End of America 3.com.
[01:46:51.317 --> 01:46:53.898]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[01:47:01.439 --> 01:47:02.960]  Coast to Coast.
[01:47:02.960 --> 01:47:05.020]  Direct from Austin.
[01:47:05.020 --> 01:47:08.241]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:47:20.578 --> 01:47:25.200]  This is our land.
[01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:28.521]  These are our people.
[01:47:28.521 --> 01:47:30.441]  The workers.
[01:47:30.441 --> 01:47:32.382]  The strivers.
[01:47:32.382 --> 01:47:35.063]  The builders.
[01:47:35.063 --> 01:47:38.524]  These are our people.
[01:47:38.524 --> 01:47:41.885]  Who are they?
[01:47:41.885 --> 01:47:44.706]  They are the dark armies.
[01:47:44.706 --> 01:47:47.527]  The dark murdering armies whose only honour
[01:47:48.910 --> 01:47:52.692]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:47:52.692 --> 01:48:01.695]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:48:01.695 --> 01:48:10.698]  Alright, I'm going to go back to Stephen, Jammin' Jerry, Greg, Richard, Garfield, Colonel Six and Carol.
[01:48:10.698 --> 01:48:11.659]  I'm out of control today.
[01:48:12.847 --> 01:48:17.629]  You know, there is a organized government disinformation movement online.
[01:48:17.629 --> 01:48:19.430]  The White House science czar admits it.
[01:48:19.430 --> 01:48:20.971]  He's public about it.
[01:48:20.971 --> 01:48:22.271]  But it's gone on for decades.
[01:48:22.271 --> 01:48:25.053]  I've interviewed former FBI agents who've admitted it.
[01:48:25.053 --> 01:48:29.695]  To go out and attack anybody that speaks out.
[01:48:29.695 --> 01:48:31.736]  The British government did it with Mahatma Gandhi.
[01:48:31.736 --> 01:48:35.418]  They did it with Martin Luther King here in this country.
[01:48:35.418 --> 01:48:41.601]  And they always tear down anybody that's trying to be a leader and anybody that tries to empower individuals.
[01:48:42.611 --> 01:48:45.412]  And I'm not even comparing myself to those great men.
[01:48:45.412 --> 01:48:48.053]  The point is they go after anybody and say, they're not real.
[01:48:48.053 --> 01:48:48.914]  Look, they did this.
[01:48:48.914 --> 01:48:49.674]  Look, they did that.
[01:48:49.674 --> 01:48:51.015]  Or they're wrong about this.
[01:48:51.015 --> 01:48:52.375]  They're wrong about that.
[01:48:52.375 --> 01:48:57.217]  So in the interest of all this, let's just say I'm discredited and I'm bad.
[01:48:57.217 --> 01:48:58.778]  The dollar is being devalued.
[01:48:58.778 --> 01:49:01.839]  They are creating cross-human animal clones.
[01:49:01.839 --> 01:49:05.280]  GMO and all the major studies is destroying our fertility.
[01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:08.022]  Diabetes has doubled in the last decade.
[01:49:08.022 --> 01:49:10.703]  World government has been announced, run by private bankers.
[01:49:11.855 --> 01:49:14.897]  So, I don't ever want to make the debates about Alex Jones.
[01:49:14.897 --> 01:49:17.238]  Like, is Alex Jones for real?
[01:49:17.238 --> 01:49:19.279]  That's like asking, are you real?
[01:49:19.279 --> 01:49:22.420]  Look at the fruits of what I've done in 16 years.
[01:49:22.420 --> 01:49:23.981]  A lot of good and some bad.
[01:49:23.981 --> 01:49:25.842]  I've been like a bull in a china cabinet.
[01:49:25.842 --> 01:49:27.523]  But my heart's good at the end of the day.
[01:49:28.464 --> 01:49:34.288]  And sometimes I have moments of great clarity and, you know, complex eloquence and beauty.
[01:49:34.288 --> 01:49:36.850]  Other times I'm ranting and screaming angrily.
[01:49:36.850 --> 01:49:38.231]  I'm real!
[01:49:38.231 --> 01:49:41.113]  And the system knows that, believe it.
[01:49:41.113 --> 01:49:48.779]  But they try to get folks all day to have more debates about Alex Jones, which at the end of the day helps the radio show and what I'm doing.
[01:49:48.779 --> 01:49:51.341]  In a way, you know, no weapon formed against us shall prosper.
[01:49:52.679 --> 01:49:57.084]  All the attacks and lies and disinformation and twisting only helps us.
[01:49:57.084 --> 01:50:06.133]  And that's one thing, one reason I always try to be the very best I can because even trying to be truthful and honest, I make mistakes and things that aren't perfect.
[01:50:06.133 --> 01:50:09.857]  And I'm arrogant and worldly like everybody else.
[01:50:09.857 --> 01:50:11.979]  But I do realize that I now am.
[01:50:13.171 --> 01:50:24.119]  You know, to a great extent, this figurehead, Ford Liberty, you know, one of only a few figureheads, and I start thinking, I better get in better shape, or I got all these freckles from sun damage, put makeup on, but I never do.
[01:50:24.119 --> 01:50:25.080]  You know, I'm the figurehead.
[01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:27.501]  I better start wearing suits more.
[01:50:27.501 --> 01:50:29.082]  But at the end of the day, you know what?
[01:50:29.082 --> 01:50:30.924]  I'm just going to be who I am.
[01:50:30.924 --> 01:50:34.166]  And I'm going to go out fishing with no sunscreen and burn my face off.
[01:50:34.166 --> 01:50:35.007]  I don't care.
[01:50:35.007 --> 01:50:35.427]  And you know what?
[01:50:35.427 --> 01:50:37.168]  If I want to eat enchiladas, I'm going to do it.
[01:50:37.168 --> 01:50:38.089]  And I just don't care.
[01:50:38.089 --> 01:50:39.130]  I just don't care.
[01:50:39.130 --> 01:50:40.751]  It's the information that matters.
[01:50:43.012 --> 01:50:47.455]  I just want a future for my children and your children, and we've all got to hang together or hang separate.
[01:50:47.455 --> 01:50:59.963]  Now I got to get to the other callers, but Stephen in Texas, you know I don't like folks calling and saying how great I am, but you're saying your wife instinctively meeting me, had a good feeling about me, and you know there's a lot to be said for female intuition.
[01:50:59.963 --> 01:51:00.863]  Dogs love me.
[01:51:00.863 --> 01:51:04.406]  I'll go to people's houses that usually have dogs that try to attack people, and they're always going,
[01:51:05.046 --> 01:51:06.887]  My German Shepherd really likes you.
[01:51:06.887 --> 01:51:08.768]  He doesn't like anybody.
[01:51:08.768 --> 01:51:10.630]  My pug always barks at people.
[01:51:10.630 --> 01:51:12.391]  Why does my pug like you so much?
[01:51:12.391 --> 01:51:14.752]  Because at the end of the day, I am a good guy.
[01:51:14.752 --> 01:51:17.214]  I am a loving, jolly person.
[01:51:17.214 --> 01:51:21.356]  But what I do doesn't stand at that point at the end of the day.
[01:51:21.356 --> 01:51:26.379]  What matters is, in the whole of my work, is it overall truthful?
[01:51:26.379 --> 01:51:27.640]  Has it been accurate?
[01:51:27.640 --> 01:51:29.401]  And unfortunately, it has.
[01:51:29.401 --> 01:51:32.023]  No one wishes, Steven, that they've been wrong more than I do.
[01:51:33.010 --> 01:51:42.117]  Absolutely, Alex, and again, I've been a long time listener of you, way back to, I think it was Channel 10 on cable access, either before or after the Banana Hat guy or something like that.
[01:51:42.117 --> 01:51:48.862]  So anyway... Yeah, operatives come from nowhere in like in a year, like Glenn Beck in Takeover or Sean Hannity.
[01:51:48.862 --> 01:51:51.444]  You know, I've been in the trenches forever coming up.
[01:51:51.946 --> 01:51:52.527]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:51:52.527 --> 01:52:05.618]  No, but just to recap the quick story again, my wife and I were having a good discussion a couple weeks after we had the rally at the Capitol, and I asked her, I said, you know, is Alex just doing this for profit and for ratings and whatnot?
[01:52:05.618 --> 01:52:14.785]  She said, let me tell you, before you showed up at the Capitol that day, I knew that if I was screaming too loud and if I got arrested or something, that I could hand our three-year-old daughter to Alex and she'd be fine.
[01:52:14.785 --> 01:52:16.166]  So keep up the great work, my friend.
[01:52:16.166 --> 01:52:17.287]  You're doing a great job.
[01:52:17.287 --> 01:52:18.028]  Thank you so much.
[01:52:18.028 --> 01:52:18.869]  I appreciate that.
[01:52:19.898 --> 01:52:31.104]  That's another COINTELPRO thing though, and I know you're responding to it, you know, to say, oh my gosh, Ron Paul's setting up a foundation to educate people and ask them for donations.
[01:52:31.104 --> 01:52:33.665]  Or my gosh, this guy's selling a book.
[01:52:33.665 --> 01:52:47.053]  The globalist, now listen to me on this and I'm going to your other calls, the globalist social engineers take our money, build government schools, and then do the exact opposite of what the parents want and what's common sense.
[01:52:47.053 --> 01:52:48.994]  The government takes your money
[01:52:50.313 --> 01:52:53.134]  And then runs PSAs brainwashing you.
[01:52:53.134 --> 01:53:00.217]  The government takes your money and uses it against you and treats you like you're a slave.
[01:53:00.217 --> 01:53:11.802]  Then in the free market, and you'll always see this in the media, I've had Nightline, MSNBC, you name it here, literally over the years, more than a hundred TV stations, they always say, you're doing this to make money.
[01:53:11.802 --> 01:53:12.643]  And I look at them and I go,
[01:53:13.971 --> 01:53:18.117]  Well, I got into this to fight tyranny because I don't want to be a slave and I hate control freaks.
[01:53:18.117 --> 01:53:18.938]  That's my instinct.
[01:53:18.938 --> 01:53:25.387]  But I said, yeah, I do like making money, hiring more people, being successful, being strong.
[01:53:25.387 --> 01:53:27.209]  I wish I had more money to build more.
[01:53:28.257 --> 01:53:32.822]  But at the end of the day, the goal is not have a bigger house or a faster, cooler car.
[01:53:32.822 --> 01:53:34.884]  I'm very happy with what I've got.
[01:53:34.884 --> 01:53:40.290]  But at the same time, we do need some wealth to be able to operate, protect ourselves, be successful.
[01:53:40.290 --> 01:53:44.455]  See, they're teaching you that you're supposed to broadcast from a tin can in the ditch.
[01:53:46.144 --> 01:53:49.487]  I take about 93% of the money comes through here and runs our operation.
[01:53:49.487 --> 01:53:52.950]  I've done two hours, almost two hours, haven't plugged a book, a video.
[01:53:52.950 --> 01:53:54.071]  In fact, I should.
[01:53:54.071 --> 01:53:56.533]  We've got a great online video bookstore.
[01:53:56.533 --> 01:53:57.714]  We've got t-shirts.
[01:53:57.714 --> 01:53:59.736]  We've got a lot of great deals.
[01:53:59.736 --> 01:54:03.459]  And the t-shirts, the books, the videos wake others up, wake you up.
[01:54:03.459 --> 01:54:05.521]  You wear your colors, wear an InfoWars shirt.
[01:54:05.521 --> 01:54:07.503]  You'll meet a lot of like-minded people.
[01:54:07.503 --> 01:54:09.584]  And your purchase funds my operation.
[01:54:10.405 --> 01:54:13.946]  I mean, I've got over 30 employees and contractors now.
[01:54:13.946 --> 01:54:16.407]  I've got 2 or 3 million visitors a day now on the web.
[01:54:16.407 --> 01:54:18.268]  I have to pay all that bandwidth.
[01:54:18.268 --> 01:54:23.370]  You know, we're here leading the fight against the globalists, giving them a good run for their money.
[01:54:23.370 --> 01:54:35.494]  You know, the bankers took banker bailout money and gave hundreds of millions to MSNBC of your tax money to sit up there and say you're a racist if you don't want government health care and George Washington's a piece of garbage.
[01:54:36.638 --> 01:54:40.362]  I don't have any of your bailout money, but I'm the bad guy, you know.
[01:54:40.362 --> 01:54:43.125]  So, if you'd like to donate to us, InfoWars.com.
[01:54:43.125 --> 01:54:50.752]  I am proud of our success, and we need more money, more capital, more members of PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:54:50.752 --> 01:54:52.914]  Man, look at all these callers.
[01:54:52.914 --> 01:54:55.477]  Let's talk to Jerry in Florida.
[01:54:55.477 --> 01:54:56.037]  You're on the air.
[01:54:56.037 --> 01:54:56.398]  Go ahead.
[01:54:57.355 --> 01:54:58.636]  Mr. Jones, good evening.
[01:54:58.636 --> 01:54:59.336]  How are you?
[01:54:59.336 --> 01:55:00.016]  Good, my friend.
[01:55:00.016 --> 01:55:01.257]  Welcome.
[01:55:01.257 --> 01:55:04.339]  Listen, I'm going to try to get this all out.
[01:55:04.339 --> 01:55:10.221]  I really want to address two to three million listeners a day.
[01:55:10.221 --> 01:55:13.703]  Well, this show only has about a million on Sunday.
[01:55:13.703 --> 01:55:23.048]  Okay, but moral of the story, I've been listening to you for the last three years almost religiously, daily.
[01:55:24.316 --> 01:55:30.098]  And in the very beginning, as I'm sure most of your new listeners coming in, I was one.
[01:55:30.098 --> 01:55:44.821]  I wanted, in the worst way, in the worst way, to be able to bust you out, you know, from my own psychological, you know, this guy's full of crap, he's making money on the internet, he's hocking, he's hocking this.
[01:55:44.821 --> 01:55:48.882]  And then you would come with the, no, go look it up.
[01:55:48.882 --> 01:55:51.663]  No, right now, this article, go to Google, look it up.
[01:55:52.667 --> 01:55:54.029]  Sure enough, it would be there.
[01:55:54.029 --> 01:56:05.979]  Well, now here, fast forward, here I am three years later, and you're right on all the time, so my disgust is in two parts.
[01:56:05.979 --> 01:56:15.528]  One, with the old listeners, including myself, in that us old listeners, we know that you're not full of crap.
[01:56:16.565 --> 01:56:22.468]  And so I think there's a tendency for us to go, well, you know what?
[01:56:22.468 --> 01:56:28.190]  I don't want to be the first guy out there to go get my head popped, but I'm going to work from behind the scenes.
[01:56:28.190 --> 01:56:30.451]  I'm going to notify my congressman.
[01:56:30.451 --> 01:56:34.373]  I'm going to, I'm going to paste email links here.
[01:56:34.373 --> 01:56:38.415]  I'm going to tell people behind the scenes to get them on to you.
[01:56:38.415 --> 01:56:42.917]  And then, you know, then you got the new listeners going, oh, this guy's full of it.
[01:56:42.917 --> 01:56:44.297]  And they'll come to know eventually.
[01:56:44.297 --> 01:56:45.298]  But my point is this.
[01:56:46.397 --> 01:56:48.318]  We are the front line.
[01:56:48.318 --> 01:56:51.358]  We're all that there is left standing between us.
[01:56:51.358 --> 01:57:02.262]  And I think that there's this general psychological view that, well, you know, okay, well maybe this guy knows, maybe he's on to something, maybe he knows something.
[01:57:03.922 --> 01:57:12.907]  You know what, as long as... But still it's just seen as another show, and well, maybe people will do something about it.
[01:57:12.907 --> 01:57:14.088]  Exactly.
[01:57:14.088 --> 01:57:24.494]  And other people sit there and nitpick all day, and like, well, we have private recruiting stations overseas, but not actual army recruiting stations, so it doesn't matter that the biggest group of recruits is from overseas.
[01:57:24.494 --> 01:57:28.596]  Technically, we don't recruit overseas, so Alex is wrong, or technically this or that.
[01:57:28.596 --> 01:57:31.938]  The point is, we know our society is going in the wrong direction.
[01:57:32.338 --> 01:57:38.322]  And all of the listeners should be engaged in activism every day if we're going to turn this tyranny around.
[01:57:38.322 --> 01:57:41.505]  The good news is the world is waking up.
[01:57:41.505 --> 01:57:42.445]  Great job with the crew.
[01:57:42.445 --> 01:57:44.086]  See you back next Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:57:44.086 --> 01:57:45.407]  Back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[01:57:45.407 --> 01:57:46.028]  Central.
[01:57:46.028 --> 01:57:47.329]  Thanks for putting up with me.
[01:57:47.329 --> 01:57:48.610]  I love you, and now go fight tyrants.
