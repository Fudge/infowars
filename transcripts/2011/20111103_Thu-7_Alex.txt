[00:00:09.346 --> 00:00:14.970]  We are back on the continuing 24 plus hour broadcast for the InfoWars Money Bomb.
[00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.311]  It's now November 4th.
[00:00:17.371 --> 00:00:19.073]  We started of course on November 3rd.
[00:00:19.093 --> 00:00:20.954]  I'm Aaron Dyke sitting in.
[00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:27.518]  Alex will be back in a few hours and we're going to be joined in just a moment by an activist named Dan Dix.
[00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:29.680]  Press for Truth in Canada.
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.263]  He's done a lot of good work and not only is it 2.43 in the morning.
[00:00:34.303 --> 00:00:35.243]  Yes, I'm a little tired.
[00:00:35.263 --> 00:00:38.926]  I've been editing this Izzerby piece over here in the other room for the past 10 hours.
[00:00:39.426 --> 00:00:41.247]  Trying to get it ready for air later.
[00:00:41.747 --> 00:00:50.190]  Not only is it late in the night if you're still listening out there, and we hope you are, but it is late in the game and it's no unspecific time in history.
[00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.012]  I'm going to get more into this later, but for a long time people weren't literate.
[00:00:55.052 --> 00:00:59.714]  Nobody knew what was going on and it's very much what people like Zbigniew Brzezinski have talked about.
[00:01:00.154 --> 00:01:05.416]  This is the time of the global awakening and it's really a big challenge of which direction it's going to go.
[00:01:05.996 --> 00:01:11.522]  So supporting an organization like InfoWars is more than just something in this limited time now.
[00:01:11.702 --> 00:01:15.686]  It's something that you need to do because this is the time in history.
[00:01:15.806 --> 00:01:20.971]  Things are changing now and if we don't influence the way things are going, we'll never have another chance.
[00:01:20.991 --> 00:01:23.113]  So if you believe in the InfoWars mission,
[00:01:24.014 --> 00:01:46.748]  Carry out similar work yourself, donate to us, get the word out, spread the DVDs, and all of that, but we especially need your support here at Infowars.com, through this Moneybomb vehicle and the rest of it, because we need to grow and reach people while we still can, while we have the power of the internet, before they clamp down, and before we enter fully this global society, so we can try to change things.
[00:01:47.588 --> 00:01:48.969]  Do we have Dan now on the line?
[00:01:51.235 --> 00:02:12.143]  Yeah, so Dan Dix is somebody, I first met him back in 2006 in Canada at the Bilderberg meeting, and I know he had done some activism before that, but he spoke on our cameras, ended up in the endgame film, and I know that was one of the events that really helped wake him up, not only to what's going on, but to the need for he himself to take action.
[00:02:12.203 --> 00:02:13.204]  He has definitely been
[00:02:13.744 --> 00:02:14.544]  I can't hear you right now.
[00:02:14.564 --> 00:02:15.145]  Is it coming through?
[00:02:15.165 --> 00:02:15.865]  Oh, you got me now?
[00:02:41.775 --> 00:02:46.097]  Hey Dan, great to have you with us, and what can we talk about here tonight?
[00:02:47.438 --> 00:02:49.038]  Oh, whatever you want to get into, man.
[00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:58.823]  Speaking about meeting you back in 2006, I definitely remember that, being interviewed for Endgame, and that was a very cool experience.
[00:02:59.443 --> 00:03:03.405]  You know, back then, I remember I used to tell a lot of people about you, Aaron.
[00:03:03.845 --> 00:03:08.027]  I would often describe you as the man behind the man.
[00:03:08.907 --> 00:03:14.932]  Because obviously, you know, it's such a big production going on over there, but a lot of times people don't realize.
[00:03:14.992 --> 00:03:24.159]  I mean, Alex is the face of it all, but there's a whole group of people behind him who are integral to the operation and making it all work.
[00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:39.227]  And, um, so I would often refer to you as the man behind the man, and I just want to say it's great now to see you getting out in front, getting on the camera, you got your own YouTube channel, and the web, you know, your Facebook and everything, and getting more active, and, uh, it's awesome!
[00:03:39.348 --> 00:03:39.788]  I'm loving it!
[00:03:40.646 --> 00:03:46.848]  Yeah, it's not even something I really intended to do, but it's what Alex talks about a lot of times, the man who gets into the arena.
[00:03:46.908 --> 00:03:49.168]  That's the Teddy Roosevelt quote, I think.
[00:03:49.628 --> 00:03:57.130]  I remember personally back to the time when I kind of knew instinctively 9-11 was an inside job, but I was real depressed about it for a long time.
[00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.371]  I saw so many people taking the bait, and I didn't know what I could do about it myself.
[00:04:01.431 --> 00:04:03.812]  I didn't understand our power to transform
[00:04:04.592 --> 00:04:06.513]  Really, everyone's reaction to that kind of stuff.
[00:04:06.533 --> 00:04:17.296]  We've won so many victories on that, and just me personally getting into the battle has transformed so many things in my own life, but also helped me reach other people, turning on other people.
[00:04:17.356 --> 00:04:18.797]  I know you've done the same thing, Dan.
[00:04:20.188 --> 00:04:23.132]  Yeah man, that's really what it's all about.
[00:04:23.753 --> 00:04:27.497]  You gotta just dive in head first and take this kind of thing head on.
[00:04:28.458 --> 00:04:34.947]  When people are wanting to get active and wanting to get involved in this movement, that's really all it takes.
[00:04:35.447 --> 00:04:39.449]  I mean, anybody can take this up and do it themselves.
[00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:41.170]  Especially nowadays.
[00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.631]  I mean, a YouTube channel is free.
[00:04:43.691 --> 00:04:45.311]  A WordPress blog is free.
[00:04:45.932 --> 00:04:49.993]  You already pretty much probably have a camera in your pocket with your cell phone.
[00:04:50.533 --> 00:04:55.876]  So it's really just a matter of taking that first initial step and doing it.
[00:04:56.476 --> 00:04:57.036]  Like I did in 2006.
[00:04:58.957 --> 00:05:08.622]  I had went to a lot of events before that, but that was pretty much the first time I brought a camera with me, and that's what gave me... I had the bug ever since then.
[00:05:08.682 --> 00:05:13.404]  I've had the itch to continue to want to do it ever since then, and that's really what it takes, man.
[00:05:13.444 --> 00:05:20.067]  It's just diving in headfirst and taking a stab at it, and, you know, anybody can do this, and that's the encouraging thing about it all.
[00:05:21.021 --> 00:05:21.601]  That's what I mean.
[00:05:21.641 --> 00:05:25.324]  The information has come to be not only free, but priceless.
[00:05:25.364 --> 00:05:28.206]  This is the time we can use that information to transform things.
[00:05:28.646 --> 00:05:37.752]  Hundreds, thousands, whatever years ago, not only could people not read, but even if you could read, you couldn't afford a book, basically, unless you were in the priest class or the royalty.
[00:05:38.412 --> 00:05:42.535]  Now we have all these tools at our fingertips, and if we don't use them, well, what's the point anyway?
[00:05:43.615 --> 00:05:44.937]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[00:05:44.998 --> 00:05:55.196]  I mean, there's no doubt technology is a double-edged sword, and the internet right now, I mean, we can essentially, in certain ways, use the system
[00:05:56.886 --> 00:06:19.700]  That's the beautiful thing about the times that we're living in now, and we have to take full advantage of it now as we can, because, you know, it's tough to say how much longer it's going to continue like this, because I believe the establishment realizes that this movement is getting absolutely huge, and they're might going to try to figure out a way to stifle our efforts.
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.201]  So, right now,
[00:06:21.741 --> 00:06:28.931]  It's the perfect time to get active and if you haven't taken that initial step, that first step, I would say do it.
[00:06:28.991 --> 00:06:30.252]  Just go for it, man.
[00:06:30.272 --> 00:06:37.262]  Get a YouTube channel, start a website, start putting yourself out there and just expose.
[00:06:38.142 --> 00:06:42.464]  And raise awareness about issues that you feel people need to hear about.
[00:06:42.884 --> 00:06:44.205]  And that's where it's at.
[00:06:44.265 --> 00:06:48.286]  And then, you know, as they often say, down the rabbit hole you'll go.
[00:06:49.087 --> 00:06:51.027]  And hopefully you'll just continue to work.
[00:06:51.087 --> 00:06:54.669]  So, it's a great time to be involved in the fight against the New World Order.
[00:06:55.251 --> 00:06:58.993]  Absolutely, and obviously it's not about knowing everything when you first get out there.
[00:06:59.013 --> 00:07:02.875]  It's about getting out there and doing it and beginning to grasp what's going on.
[00:07:03.296 --> 00:07:06.237]  But at the same time, we have stuff like the Occupy Wall Street movement.
[00:07:06.257 --> 00:07:11.360]  A lot of the righteous anger from the masses, the 99%, as they like to call it, really the 99.999%.
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.901]  I think it's about a million to one ratio of the true elites.
[00:07:17.343 --> 00:07:24.986]  But the point is, many of them, as well-meaning as they may be, are not sophisticated enough to even understand how the Federal Reserve affects our lives.
[00:07:25.407 --> 00:07:34.831]  And so all the more reason that we need well-educated Infowarriors to get out there and try to spread the message and get people on our side recognizing the right issues.
[00:07:35.571 --> 00:07:39.212]  Now, I know a lot of your films have dealt with the past G20 meetings.
[00:07:39.232 --> 00:07:42.814]  They have another one coming up in Cannes, if I'm not mistaken.
[00:07:43.474 --> 00:07:49.200]  And one of the things you highlight in there is all the attempts to steer those protests in the wrong direction.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:53.584]  Provocateurs, people infiltrating, trying to spread the message and change it.
[00:07:54.324 --> 00:07:56.787]  And obviously that can go in both directions.
[00:07:57.127 --> 00:08:05.575]  But we've really seen Occupy being drawn towards the lure of the seemingly promising global solutions that they have.
[00:08:06.215 --> 00:08:07.216]  Ready and waiting.
[00:08:07.556 --> 00:08:09.818]  How do we get people steered in the right direction?
[00:08:09.938 --> 00:08:16.624]  And also, what kind of infiltration and provocateur things have we seen in this movement and in the coming G20 meetings?
[00:08:16.644 --> 00:08:28.214]  Well, with the G20 kicking off today, I believe, in France, I often refer to it as the traveling circus of tyranny, because that's really what it does.
[00:08:28.274 --> 00:08:30.055]  Every city that it goes to every year
[00:08:30.956 --> 00:08:45.061]  They're pretty much not only conditioning the people and showing them the pure power and might that they have, they are also conditioning the police forces to go ahead and enforce all of these things.
[00:08:45.461 --> 00:08:52.123]  And of course, this is an area where a lot of people have learned about this group called the Black Block, as you mentioned.
[00:08:52.684 --> 00:08:58.546]  And as you'll see in my film, Into the Fire, these guys pretty much anywhere where the Black Block
[00:08:59.386 --> 00:09:02.428]  Was, um, police were nowhere to be found.
[00:09:02.448 --> 00:09:16.819]  Uh, what ended up happening is you had a group of about, uh, 70 or 80 of these guys who were pretty much given a green light to go ahead and rampage the city and, uh, you know, smash up the banks and do whatever they want downtown.
[00:09:17.379 --> 00:09:20.181]  But, you know, that's, that is what the elite wants.
[00:09:20.561 --> 00:09:20.661]  Um,
[00:09:21.622 --> 00:09:23.183]  They want you to get out into the streets.
[00:09:23.243 --> 00:09:30.426]  They want you to start smashing things up, causing a big scene, a big ruckus, so that they can step in and say, whoa, look at these guys.
[00:09:30.446 --> 00:09:31.687]  Look how crazy this is.
[00:09:31.707 --> 00:09:34.548]  We're going to have to step in and deal with the situation.
[00:09:34.568 --> 00:09:40.151]  It all goes back to this whole order out of chaos concept, which they're doing now.
[00:09:40.271 --> 00:09:43.652]  And I do worry a little bit about the current Occupy movement.
[00:09:45.373 --> 00:09:50.617]  I've been speaking with a lot of the people here in Toronto, and I'm starting to feel it's kind of 50-50.
[00:09:50.757 --> 00:09:56.622]  I mean, there's a lot of people around here who are fully aware of the problems with fractional reserve banking.
[00:09:57.202 --> 00:10:02.846]  And, you know, the Bank of Canada does have the ability to print its own money interest-free, but we don't do that.
[00:10:03.287 --> 00:10:04.828]  So a lot of people are aware of that.
[00:10:05.448 --> 00:10:07.290]  However, I'm still finding a lot of these people
[00:10:08.366 --> 00:10:17.972]  These anti-capitalist type people who are pushing for socialism and communism and kind of trying to steer the movement into a direction which is not going to help anyone.
[00:10:18.813 --> 00:10:26.178]  So certainly it's something we have to keep an eye on because it's tough to say right now where this thing is going to go.
[00:10:28.351 --> 00:10:32.193]  Yeah, but we do know they're offering all these global solutions.
[00:10:32.233 --> 00:10:51.643]  So many different groups, none of them officially speaking for the movement, are trying to draw people in to, whether it's a global Tobin tax or whatever the solution may be, a new global constitution, supposedly trying to democratize the IMF and other really awful, hegemonic global institutions, Dan.
[00:10:52.544 --> 00:10:54.545]  That has to play into these G20 meetings.
[00:10:55.005 --> 00:10:56.526]  What are they aiming for specifically?
[00:10:57.298 --> 00:10:59.400]  Well, that's why we need to get to the root of the problem.
[00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:07.946]  That's why people need to focus on what the real root of the problem is, and it's the issuance of currency out of thin air.
[00:11:07.986 --> 00:11:12.269]  The ability for private banks to print money and lend it out at interest.
[00:11:15.191 --> 00:11:20.796]  People are aware that our whole financial institutions are a major problem.
[00:11:20.816 --> 00:11:24.840]  That's why there's such huge protests that come out to the G20 summits.
[00:11:26.161 --> 00:11:29.985]  So again, we just need to continue to raise awareness about what some of the
[00:11:30.345 --> 00:11:30.425]  Hmm.
[00:11:50.356 --> 00:11:51.978]  Yeah, we'll see how this all develops.
[00:11:52.078 --> 00:12:05.174]  But of course, I mean, another thing these groups like the IMF have done is really cast a wide net that gradually over time draws in all these client states into this new world order system, really making us all debt slaves.
[00:12:05.234 --> 00:12:06.776]  And so if we don't figure this out,
[00:12:07.497 --> 00:12:22.677]  The end of it all is going to be coming soon, but of course everything's changing right now We got the whole European zone in crisis And they're ready to blame the people for not accepting this debt for the whole fall the next part of the crash But we know who set this up.
[00:12:22.697 --> 00:12:23.559]  We know who designed it
[00:12:24.687 --> 00:12:25.047]  Yeah.
[00:12:25.567 --> 00:12:26.208]  Yeah, for sure.
[00:12:26.288 --> 00:12:31.230]  And we have a fairly good idea of where this could potentially lead.
[00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:53.000]  One aspect of the occupation movement that somewhat worries me is how it all could potentially tie into this new age type of movement and type of agenda about this unified consciousness concept and having the whole world unified globally under one particular issue.
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:13:07.438]  I think people need to be careful and be aware that it's very quite possible that sometimes some things within the truth movement could be used as that vehicle that the New World Order needs.
[00:13:08.499 --> 00:13:09.260]  So, you know...
[00:13:11.245 --> 00:13:15.590]  I have hope that, you know, because I have hope that people are going to do the right thing.
[00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:20.716]  I mean, things are going well because people are getting out in the streets.
[00:13:20.756 --> 00:13:22.157]  That's the beautiful thing, basically.
[00:13:22.438 --> 00:13:23.759]  I mean, people are getting active.
[00:13:23.779 --> 00:13:25.401]  People are getting out in the streets.
[00:13:25.641 --> 00:13:28.124]  They're realizing things need to change.
[00:13:28.684 --> 00:13:29.786]  And that's a good thing.
[00:13:30.106 --> 00:13:39.214]  We just have to be careful that when this gets onto a massive, global kind of scale with everybody on the same page, we gotta remember that's part of the goals of the New World Order.
[00:13:40.074 --> 00:13:42.216]  So it's a tricky one, but we gotta watch out for that.
[00:13:45.099 --> 00:13:46.220]  Yeah, well said, Dan.
[00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:58.210]  Why don't you tell us about some of the stuff you've seen in the past at these G20 events with the police provocateurs, how they were identified, and what kind of divisive actions they caused so people could look out for it in the future.
[00:13:59.275 --> 00:13:59.555]  Sure.
[00:14:00.196 --> 00:14:08.182]  My first experience with that was actually in 2007 in Montebello for the SPP Summit.
[00:14:08.382 --> 00:14:17.970]  I went there to cover it and that's when the first, the infamous three agent provocateurs were caught red-handed.
[00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:21.451]  Dressed up as aggressive protesters.
[00:14:21.491 --> 00:14:24.092]  They had the masks and the rocks in their hands.
[00:14:24.692 --> 00:14:26.913]  And the Quebec police ended up admitting to it.
[00:14:27.493 --> 00:14:30.394]  And they were totally caught red-handed.
[00:14:30.454 --> 00:14:39.477]  And it opened up Canadians' eyes to the fact that the Canadian government is willing to go to these lengths, these fascist lengths, to in order to
[00:14:40.177 --> 00:14:43.038]  Stifle into silence a legitimate protest.
[00:14:44.318 --> 00:14:49.080]  So it's a common tactic that is being used to try to silence the people.
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:57.523]  And, you know, there's no doubt that there's a good possibility that a lot of that took place at the G20 in Toronto.
[00:14:57.563 --> 00:15:04.685]  When you have a group like the Black Bloc, it's so perfectly convenient for that type of a situation.
[00:15:05.085 --> 00:15:06.906]  And as you'll see in our film, Into the Fire,
[00:15:07.566 --> 00:15:23.817]  Uh, there are some very questionable clips, um, where members of the black bloc can be seen running behind a police line, uh, where the police, uh, you know, are blocking off the protesters from the police, and you'll see a couple guys in black bloc clothing go running through the line.
[00:15:24.881 --> 00:15:29.127]  So that raises an eyebrow and that gets us wondering, you know, what exactly is going on?
[00:15:29.147 --> 00:15:40.201]  It's so hard when you have 22 different jurisdictions of police came into the city that day, that weekend, from all over Canada.
[00:15:40.741 --> 00:15:42.243]  So these guys are
[00:15:43.727 --> 00:15:45.807]  They're not listening to their regular bosses.
[00:15:46.388 --> 00:15:48.488]  They're listening to the peace in their ear.
[00:15:48.828 --> 00:15:53.089]  You know, when they're told to march west, they're gonna march west.
[00:15:53.849 --> 00:16:00.130]  When they're told to go and kettle this small group of people, they're gonna do it and not really question their orders.
[00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:07.352]  So that's another big part of the problem and another way that the Black Bloc was able to go in and do their things.
[00:16:07.432 --> 00:16:08.972]  I mean, there was stand-down orders.
[00:16:09.392 --> 00:16:11.963]  Here in Toronto.
[00:16:12.043 --> 00:16:13.810]  Some of the police have come out and said...
[00:16:14.864 --> 00:16:17.246]  We were ordered, we were told, do not engage.
[00:16:18.166 --> 00:16:27.533]  So again, they were just listening to the peace in their ear, and I think a lot of the police around here felt that they themselves were manipulated.
[00:16:27.553 --> 00:16:34.798]  They had to carry out this Public Works Protection Act law, which ended up being a big lie.
[00:16:35.078 --> 00:16:39.682]  We were all led to believe that we couldn't film within five meters of this fence.
[00:16:40.771 --> 00:16:43.893]  And that we had to present our ID at pretty much any time.
[00:16:44.433 --> 00:16:46.574]  It turns out that's not the case.
[00:16:46.594 --> 00:16:47.735]  It turned out not to be true.
[00:16:47.755 --> 00:16:56.120]  Toronto Chief Bill Blair at the time came out and admitted, yeah, you know what, well, I was just trying to keep the bad guys out, so we did what we had to do.
[00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:01.483]  So some of the things that went on at the G20 there in Toronto, just unbelievable.
[00:17:02.623 --> 00:17:10.350]  We did our best to document the whole event pretty much chronologically throughout the entire weekend.
[00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:14.113]  So if anybody, you want to see it for yourself, we have it online.
[00:17:14.133 --> 00:17:22.600]  You can go on YouTube, just type in Into the Fire, and of course you can get the DVD at Infowars.com or PressForTruth.ca.
[00:17:23.141 --> 00:17:27.504]  And we encourage you to do that because we went all out on this particular DVD.
[00:17:28.505 --> 00:17:35.291]  We got hours and hours of extras, extended interviews, and a lot of special features and behind-the-scenes stuff.
[00:17:36.352 --> 00:17:41.316]  So if you want to support us, pick one up from PressForTruth.ca or InfoWars.com.
[00:17:41.597 --> 00:17:46.481]  But if you'd like to just see it for yourself, just go on to YouTube and check it out and you'll see what I'm talking about.
[00:17:46.781 --> 00:17:51.124]  And of course it is important to support all the great InfoWars activists out there.
[00:17:51.484 --> 00:17:54.626]  That's how we help build each other up and how we get that word out.
[00:17:54.646 --> 00:17:55.847]  That's how we reach everyone.
[00:17:56.247 --> 00:17:57.788]  And here we are at 3 o'clock.
[00:17:57.948 --> 00:18:03.192]  I believe that puts us 16 hours into this marathon transition, uh, transmission.
[00:18:03.212 --> 00:18:13.959]  I just want to make sure we thank all the people out there who've been giving money to us, who've been helping us grow, those who can't give money, spreading the word, uh, sharing the link to this broadcast.
[00:18:14.019 --> 00:18:15.280]  It's not too late to do that.
[00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:19.464]  Uh, also sharing all the free films that are out there from Alex Jones.
[00:18:19.484 --> 00:18:25.550]  We sell them on DVD also, but they're available on YouTube and the other platforms, Dan Dick's film and the rest of them.
[00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:28.173]  And it's so important to get that word out.
[00:18:28.633 --> 00:18:32.156]  Uh, you know, right now we see the current G20 meeting in Cairns.
[00:18:32.497 --> 00:18:37.422]  A lot of the protesters there, uh, say they're joining up with the Occupy, uh, protesters.
[00:18:37.882 --> 00:19:02.102]  We're now worldwide and then at the same time we see in New York City for instance the police being bought really in many cases as a private security to work with the Wall Street firms to keep those protesters under check and just more generally to occupy the downtown area with their own surveillance and police state grid that is privately driven but also uses public resources.
[00:19:02.742 --> 00:19:04.303]  And so that's something to keep an eye on.
[00:19:04.703 --> 00:19:11.846]  But if you believe in this InfoWars mission, it's important you either donate or otherwise help us grow in one way or another.
[00:19:11.886 --> 00:19:19.350]  We have to reach more people while we still have time, while we have access to these wonderful platforms, the double-edged sword that technology gives us.
[00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:33.680]  As things change and hopefully don't move further into this global state, you know, they've sold us on globalization, saying how great it is that somehow, although it's flawed, it'll eventually become a benefit for everyone.
[00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:35.801]  But at the same time, we've seen a race to the bottom.
[00:19:36.242 --> 00:19:46.449]  Nobody really focuses on how they've shipped out the jobs, de-industrialized the U.S., shipped the jobs to China, where there's agreements for basically slave labor in many cases.
[00:19:46.989 --> 00:19:50.011]  And just really cheap products that don't build up the country.
[00:19:50.651 --> 00:19:58.096]  Something may be cheaper at Walmart, but it doesn't allow an interchange of decentralized independent businesses to grow.
[00:19:58.136 --> 00:20:05.180]  It sucks out really the backbone of America and leaves just that corporate facade running our whole country.
[00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:08.762]  Everything has really kind of hollowed out in that way.
[00:20:09.142 --> 00:20:11.864]  It's time we admit it and it's time we do something about it.
[00:20:12.464 --> 00:20:13.445]  Dan Dix, your comments.
[00:20:14.485 --> 00:20:15.565]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:20:16.185 --> 00:20:24.068]  Another area which the globalization is fast-tracking its way right now is in regards to the North American Union.
[00:20:24.088 --> 00:20:32.530]  I mean, this agenda has been on the table for a long, long time now, and recently, even in the last few weeks,
[00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:35.051]  A lot of things are coming together.
[00:20:35.131 --> 00:20:43.733]  I know the, I believe it's called the Interstate, the I-69, pretty much the Napa Superhighway, is nearing completion.
[00:20:44.474 --> 00:20:45.794]  That's definitely underway.
[00:20:46.334 --> 00:20:52.376]  And that's something that we have to be very aware of, cautious of, vigilant of here in Canada, U.S.
[00:20:52.516 --> 00:20:53.876]  and Mexico.
[00:20:54.457 --> 00:21:02.379]  And again, that's another topic that we've covered in United We Fall, is this whole concept of those three countries coming in together.
[00:21:02.999 --> 00:21:05.340]  Very similar to what we saw with the European Union.
[00:21:06.201 --> 00:21:10.903]  So yeah, they're ramping up their efforts as well.
[00:21:11.084 --> 00:21:15.286]  So that's why it is so important at this time to continue the fight.
[00:21:15.326 --> 00:21:21.689]  And I would encourage people also to do whatever you can to donate to the Money Bomb at Infowars.com.
[00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:24.611]  It's amazing what you guys have been able to do.
[00:21:25.231 --> 00:21:32.999]  In the 15 years that you've been doing this, and especially since last Money Bomb, you've expanded your operation in such a huge way.
[00:21:33.039 --> 00:21:33.980]  It's very impressive.
[00:21:34.401 --> 00:21:35.282]  It's very encouraging.
[00:21:35.302 --> 00:21:36.443]  It's very awe-inspiring.
[00:21:36.603 --> 00:21:41.028]  And I want to encourage people to do the same as well, Aaron.
[00:21:42.318 --> 00:21:46.021]  Yeah, and you mentioned the NAFTA superhighways.
[00:21:46.041 --> 00:21:51.845]  That's one of the many areas where we've fought back, we've said no, we've told them we don't want this North American Union.
[00:21:52.165 --> 00:21:53.386]  They said it doesn't exist.
[00:21:54.086 --> 00:21:57.468]  People continue to bring out the agenda and they've continued to play possum.
[00:21:57.508 --> 00:22:03.533]  I know here in Texas, there was really a rally cry that they had been defeated, that the whole project was somehow called off.
[00:22:04.273 --> 00:22:11.358]  But then if you drive down highways, I know I went down Highway 77 that goes down to South Padre Island and so forth.
[00:22:11.758 --> 00:22:16.140]  And it tells you how the new NAFTA Super Corridor is soon to be coming in.
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:18.581]  You know, toll roads that they're putting up.
[00:22:18.641 --> 00:22:24.523]  So they're still moving this agenda forward, not always calling it what they originally were calling it.
[00:22:25.204 --> 00:22:29.385]  And with the larger North American Union, you've seen that fought back.
[00:22:29.425 --> 00:22:33.727]  But at the same time, you've seen greater border things coming forward.
[00:22:34.047 --> 00:22:37.028]  The stuff with the drug cartels, Fast and Furious ties into that.
[00:22:37.789 --> 00:22:38.189]  Dan Dix.
[00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:44.174]  Yeah, of course they're going to continue to tell us that this is going to be for our benefit.
[00:22:44.194 --> 00:22:47.937]  This is going to be beneficial for trade.
[00:22:48.278 --> 00:22:52.441]  It's going to move goods and services in and out of the countries quicker and easier.
[00:22:54.103 --> 00:22:55.224]  But again, this is
[00:22:55.844 --> 00:22:59.187]  This is the facade, this is what they're trying to make you believe.
[00:22:59.287 --> 00:23:03.050]  Really, it's all about, you know, the endgame is joining the three together.
[00:23:03.371 --> 00:23:10.297]  I mean, in our film, United We Fall, we talk to a lot of the major players, a lot of the guys who are really involved in the push for this thing.
[00:23:10.877 --> 00:23:16.422]  We interviewed Bilderberg members and Trilateral Commission members and members of the CFR.
[00:23:17.022 --> 00:23:18.704]  We spoke with so many different people.
[00:23:19.524 --> 00:23:27.031]  We also got, you know, a lot of activists, like Luke Hradowski, and we spoke with Alex Jones, and people like that.
[00:23:27.091 --> 00:23:37.521]  So the subtitle of the film is, uh, Three Nations, Two Sides, One Union, because we really wanted people to hear it from the horse's mouth.
[00:23:38.562 --> 00:23:48.552]  So they can get an idea of what these guys are actually pushing for, and then also hear it from the alternative information side to get that viewpoint out there as well.
[00:23:48.672 --> 00:23:56.040]  So if people are interested in learning about what this whole North American Union agenda is all about,
[00:23:56.921 --> 00:23:59.622]  Again, I would encourage you to either check it out online.
[00:23:59.702 --> 00:24:01.043]  It's called United We Fall.
[00:24:01.083 --> 00:24:02.304]  You can find it on YouTube.
[00:24:02.664 --> 00:24:08.747]  And again, if you want to support InfoWars.com or PressForTruth.ca, we'd ask that you grab the DVD.
[00:24:08.787 --> 00:24:11.028]  We got a lot of good special features on that one as well.
[00:24:12.062 --> 00:24:14.243]  Yeah, and look what InfoWars has done over the years.
[00:24:14.283 --> 00:24:20.667]  We've talked about this, but we've given spotlights to people like you said, like Luke Hradowski, to yourself, to so many others.
[00:24:20.747 --> 00:24:24.969]  Get people to become active, show what they can do, and then others come along as well.
[00:24:25.029 --> 00:24:26.310]  I mean, that's just two names.
[00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:35.475]  There's been hundreds of people who've moved through this platform, who've helped shine a light, and we continue to grow, so that's why it's important that you support us.
[00:24:38.917 --> 00:24:48.845]  Throughout history, there's been a trend that we are treated as feudal slaves, either outright slaves, or tenant farmers of various kinds throughout the years.
[00:24:49.686 --> 00:24:55.471]  Information has always been a power for those ruling classes, and the people have never had that information.
[00:24:55.511 --> 00:25:00.075]  This 20th century, now the 21st century, has really been the first time that
[00:25:02.036 --> 00:25:17.183]  really everyone has had access not of course not everyone is illiterate but everyone has the chance really at least in the Western world maybe not in the third world and this is a real chance that we have 1776 is still new in history it is not something old
[00:25:18.523 --> 00:25:30.952]  The Bill of Rights enshrining our personal rights, our liberties, our right to free speech, our right to the Second Amendment, our right to the Fourth Amendment, which is being violated by TSA and so many other entities.
[00:25:31.313 --> 00:25:37.297]  That is all new to the slavery, to the tyranny that has been set in place for so long.
[00:25:37.837 --> 00:25:41.420]  And that's just one of many reasons we're in this fight and we're in it together.
[00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:43.022]  But we have to do it right now.
[00:25:43.462 --> 00:25:47.065]  This is that short window of time where we can fight back with the tools that are out there.
[00:25:47.485 --> 00:25:49.267]  Primarily, I mean technology.
[00:25:49.687 --> 00:25:51.289]  And we've gone through all the eugenics.
[00:25:51.469 --> 00:25:53.090]  We've shown the social engineering.
[00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:54.431]  I can get more into it later.
[00:25:54.451 --> 00:25:56.253]  I've just been going over this ISRB stuff.
[00:25:56.753 --> 00:26:14.178]  At the great lengths they've gone to not only tell us in their books what they think of us, how we're a separate species that's to be dumbed down, to be taught false information a la 1984, that really they believe they are the future, those few elites and their technocrats that work with them.
[00:26:14.738 --> 00:26:19.339]  And this is our only chance to fight back and say, no, we're human beings and we're going to be part of the future.
[00:26:20.139 --> 00:26:21.860]  And so that's the fight we're all part of.
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:25.781]  Dan, some of your closing comments and then we have other stuff we're going to cover.
[00:26:27.507 --> 00:26:28.327]  Uh, yeah, sure.
[00:26:30.649 --> 00:26:44.535]  You know, again, back to what we were talking about, what Alex, one of the awesome things that he does is he inspires others out there to follow his example and do similar things.
[00:26:45.235 --> 00:26:46.456]  And there's no doubt...
[00:26:47.276 --> 00:27:05.358]  That he has been integral to my entire awakening process and has, you know, the whole direction of my life, he's certainly been an influence on that, and I thank you guys for that, and I have constantly been trying to pick up
[00:27:05.678 --> 00:27:14.408]  My efforts, ever since 2005, 2006, trying to figure out ways to reach more people and to do this better and just get better at it.
[00:27:14.508 --> 00:27:21.255]  Again, I dove in head first, not really knowing what I'm doing, and I'm just trying to do my best.
[00:27:22.416 --> 00:27:25.938]  I'm getting to a point now where I want to take it to a next level as well.
[00:27:26.938 --> 00:27:31.581]  So I'm working on a new website that I would hope that people would check out.
[00:27:31.681 --> 00:27:37.023]  I'm hoping to launch this thing in the first day of 2012, in January 1st.
[00:27:37.083 --> 00:27:39.764]  And it's going to be PressForTruth.tv.
[00:27:40.265 --> 00:27:46.508]  And if people like what I'm doing, you like my work, you want to support what I'm doing, please go check out PressForTruth.tv.
[00:27:46.568 --> 00:27:48.529]  It's not going to be ready for another
[00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:50.731]  Until January.
[00:27:51.412 --> 00:27:54.155]  But this is another way that I'm going to be able to do this work.
[00:27:54.656 --> 00:27:56.198]  This very, very important work.
[00:27:56.759 --> 00:27:59.122]  And just continue to spread this information.
[00:28:00.285 --> 00:28:03.566]  And of course, we've said this already, but we do have to support each other.
[00:28:03.626 --> 00:28:25.635]  I mean, just look at all the things the Rockefeller, the Gates Foundation, the Carnegie Foundation have done to literally steer entire education movements, entire developments of science and technology, which direction the research is going, where the global agreements are going, how the United Nations and its related entities and organs develop and come out of the
[00:28:26.135 --> 00:28:29.516]  out of the darkness into dominance they've tried to establish.
[00:28:29.896 --> 00:28:32.176]  It's all coordinated through their central funding.
[00:28:32.476 --> 00:28:34.797]  They've paid money to try to destroy records.
[00:28:34.817 --> 00:28:47.259]  Isserby talks about this, none of the video will be playing later, but in other parts, I think in part one, how they tried to buy up and destroy the only copies of the hearings on the role of foundations in our country.
[00:28:47.319 --> 00:28:50.099]  Something that the people were not supposed to be allowed to know about.
[00:28:50.479 --> 00:28:53.500]  We have helped bring you that information along with other researchers.
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:29:00.763]  This too, Dan, because I know you were at that 2006 Bilderberg meeting, something really I haven't heard people talk about.
[00:29:00.783 --> 00:29:15.889]  Now, Alex and others have really helped bring out how the left-right paradigm is false, how the Federal Reserve and other entities are so central to what's going on, and how it's really this big cartel meeting of people on all sides of the spectrum working and coordinating together
[00:29:16.469 --> 00:29:20.512]  Uh, even though they seem to be individual and separate, uh, outside of that.
[00:29:20.612 --> 00:29:28.957]  I know in 2006, we got information out of the meeting, and it's in the in-game film, about how they're planning to pop the housing bubble.
[00:29:28.977 --> 00:29:30.138]  Nobody knew that then.
[00:29:30.258 --> 00:29:32.840]  Nobody knew they were gonna pop the housing bubble in 2006.
[00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:36.602]  InfoWars, Alex Jones brought you that information.
[00:29:36.642 --> 00:29:40.505]  So many other researchers, Jim Tucker, uh, and the others.
[00:29:41.065 --> 00:29:42.386]  And, and look what happened.
[00:29:42.426 --> 00:29:45.488]  It didn't happen until 2008, but it was totally true, Dan Dix.
[00:29:46.127 --> 00:29:47.508]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[00:29:47.828 --> 00:29:54.634]  And I think a lot of people now are realizing because of that, that getting out of debt is absolutely crucial.
[00:29:56.376 --> 00:30:08.306]  When you have multiple credit cards and a line of credit and mortgages and loans and all these things, the global elite literally have their bony little fingers wrapped around your neck
[00:30:08.746 --> 00:30:11.248]  And they can squeeze at just about any time.
[00:30:12.149 --> 00:30:14.831]  So getting out of debt is absolutely crucial.
[00:30:16.392 --> 00:30:18.193]  It is easier said than done.
[00:30:18.213 --> 00:30:22.096]  I mean, we are all born into this debt-based system.
[00:30:22.697 --> 00:30:25.158]  And a lot of the times it might even mean
[00:30:26.419 --> 00:30:31.942]  Lowering your standards of living so that you can own something outright.
[00:30:32.642 --> 00:30:36.764]  But I think that's one of the areas that people need to focus on in their own lives.
[00:30:37.505 --> 00:30:40.366]  Because you've got to change yourself before you change the world.
[00:30:40.826 --> 00:30:51.612]  And I think getting out of debt is absolutely crucial to taking the right steps in the right direction in regards to fighting the New World Order.
[00:30:52.012 --> 00:30:58.055]  I agree, and of course trying to live within your means is a good start too, particularly for people who don't have extra means.
[00:30:59.056 --> 00:31:01.817]  And of course these credit cards and everything are very predatory.
[00:31:02.397 --> 00:31:12.483]  I think the other side of that same coin is trying to build an independent life, trying to detach from a system, especially in the areas where it's predatory, and that is so many of those areas.
[00:31:12.523 --> 00:31:16.225]  Try to get out of that web, try to build your own personal assets.
[00:31:16.705 --> 00:31:20.787]  I haven't been able to do it all myself, but I know what direction I'd like to be able to go.
[00:31:21.447 --> 00:31:26.029]  I know there are people who grow their own food and so forth and so on.
[00:31:26.069 --> 00:31:27.730]  I think that's an important part of it as well.
[00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:29.871]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[00:31:29.891 --> 00:31:36.794]  And you know, just closing up comments, I was listening to a few of the guests earlier.
[00:31:36.814 --> 00:31:38.755]  There's been so many awesome guests on today.
[00:31:39.355 --> 00:31:49.060]  And you know, I believe what a lot of the other ones were saying is that this is indeed, when you look at it, you get into the crux of it.
[00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:57.863]  We're involved with spiritual warfare here and I think one of the crucial things is to get right with God as well.
[00:31:57.883 --> 00:32:08.046]  I think mankind having turned their backs on God pretty much is also part of the reason why we're in the situation that we are in.
[00:32:08.787 --> 00:32:12.888]  So I am in total agreeance with a lot of the previous guests in that regards.
[00:32:13.648 --> 00:32:18.690]  I think that is one of these solutions that people need to focus on as well.
[00:32:19.929 --> 00:32:28.334]  Yeah, it's really incredible too, and when everybody comes on at once, it becomes this big flow of energy and consciousness, and I think everybody's thinking off of each other too.
[00:32:28.354 --> 00:32:33.317]  So that's just another great thing about this kind of long marathon broadcast.
[00:32:33.637 --> 00:32:39.100]  Well, thanks a lot for joining us, Dan, and I hope people will check out your work at PressForTruth.ca, right?
[00:32:39.952 --> 00:32:40.652]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:32:40.732 --> 00:32:41.672]  Okay, thanks guys.
[00:32:41.692 --> 00:32:44.053]  Keep up the great work and good luck with the rest of it.
[00:32:44.393 --> 00:32:45.233]  Great, have a good night.
[00:32:45.873 --> 00:33:00.877]  And we again do want to thank all the people who have supported us monetarily, but of course also those who have shared the link, who spread the word, who simply told people about the InfoWars broadcast, who tried to turn people on to alternative information.
[00:33:00.937 --> 00:33:08.619]  It's not just our own personal lives that we have to detach from the system and build up our own areas, but we need to build up a good
[00:33:09.419 --> 00:33:09.979]  I don't
[00:33:26.747 --> 00:33:27.268]  All tides.
[00:33:27.308 --> 00:33:29.469]  I don't think that phrase is coming out the way I planned it.
[00:33:30.250 --> 00:33:31.551]  But I've got a lot of notes here.
[00:33:31.611 --> 00:33:33.873]  It'd be hard to go through it in detail.
[00:33:34.294 --> 00:33:45.163]  But so many of the people we consider eugenicists, whether it's the Huxley family, Aldous Huxley, his brother Julian Huxley, who ran UNESCO, the Rockefeller family, the Harrimans family,
[00:33:45.623 --> 00:33:56.527]  Not only did they build up so many of our enemies in World War II, like Nazi Germany built up, Soviet Russia financed them and built them up as this Hegelian dialectic false enemy.
[00:33:56.567 --> 00:33:59.088]  They've also totally socially engineered us.
[00:33:59.489 --> 00:34:07.752]  They've not only laid the claim that they could decide how many people live or die and try to exercise control over that.
[00:34:08.112 --> 00:34:12.814]  They have tried to physiochemically control the way we think.
[00:34:13.614 --> 00:34:22.762]  The kind of inputs we have and you see that just for instance through the Rockefeller Foundation At places like Caltech and other important research centers.
[00:34:23.302 --> 00:34:35.092]  I have that book here the molecular vision of life It's one of the ones I've covered and it's just incredible they list here on page 46 how they want to control psychobiology internal secretions nutrition
[00:34:35.912 --> 00:34:37.353]  That's vitamins and so forth.
[00:34:37.713 --> 00:34:44.655]  Radiation, biology of sex, experimentation, chemical embryology, genetics, general physiology, biophysics.
[00:34:45.035 --> 00:34:51.978]  They're really trying to game our lives and control it all through the centrally steered, privately controlled, but publicly
[00:34:52.458 --> 00:34:53.039]  I don't think so.
[00:35:12.578 --> 00:35:14.399]  And that's just another direction we have to go.
[00:35:14.419 --> 00:35:16.919]  Now I know we have another guest coming up in a few minutes.
[00:35:16.959 --> 00:35:19.700]  He's going to update us on the Occupy Movement.
[00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:26.982]  He's here in Dallas, here in Texas rather, locally in Dallas at the Occupy Dallas Federal Reserve Movement.
[00:35:28.502 --> 00:35:29.602]  And that is Rick Warden.
[00:35:29.642 --> 00:35:32.123]  But first, I think we should throw to a video.
[00:35:32.143 --> 00:35:34.563]  Hopefully they can get that ready.
[00:35:34.583 --> 00:35:36.524]  And I just want to remind you... What?
[00:35:36.624 --> 00:35:37.044]  It is ready?
[00:35:38.513 --> 00:35:43.795]  Yeah, we'll throw to that in just a second and remind you to donate at InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[00:35:43.815 --> 00:35:46.195]  You can also get the free video streams there.
[00:35:46.596 --> 00:35:50.857]  This broadcast is not just beginning, but it's far from over.
[00:35:50.937 --> 00:35:53.298]  It has well over 8 hours to go.
[00:35:53.338 --> 00:35:57.199]  I think 11, all things told, to the end of the next broadcast.
[00:35:57.619 --> 00:35:59.020]  And there's so much information.
[00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:00.340]  Archive these links.
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:01.760]  Capture the videos.
[00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:02.581]  Save them yourself.
[00:36:02.621 --> 00:36:03.341]  Put them on disk.
[00:36:03.861 --> 00:36:15.889]  Spread them to your friends and family let people know about this broadcast and of course Help us monetarily if you don't donate money directly Help buy the products and buy from our sponsors.
[00:36:15.909 --> 00:36:33.021]  There's a lot of good sponsors too that can improve your lives I've tried to check out a lot of the nutritional ones and had some improvements in those ways just on my own But it's important that you help this operation and and help us grow in so many ways and of course the things you buy and spread the words about
[00:36:34.061 --> 00:36:36.982]  themselves become a way to get the word out more.
[00:36:37.482 --> 00:36:40.842]  Well, you know what I'm trying to say and we really appreciate those who've helped us.
[00:36:41.362 --> 00:36:42.643]  Let's go to a video right now.
[00:36:50.164 --> 00:36:59.726]  My friends, please pay attention to the information I'm about to cover and research the links that we'll post below this video so that you understand none of this is my opinion, it is fact.
[00:37:01.069 --> 00:37:04.171]  This issue is the most important issue going on in the world.
[00:37:04.471 --> 00:37:06.152]  It is scientific tyranny.
[00:37:07.013 --> 00:37:15.878]  I've read literally hundreds of government white papers and documents and books like Ecoscience, where the White House science czar talks about forcibly drugging the water to dumb you down and sterilize you.
[00:37:17.182 --> 00:37:30.971]  But now, they're in the New York Times and Time Magazine and everywhere, and all the major medical journals, promoting not only drugging the water with lithium, which by the way they're already doing, but now they're announcing it, to make you servile.
[00:37:31.631 --> 00:37:37.115]  But now, they are admitting that they plan to deploy something I learned about a decade ago.
[00:37:37.395 --> 00:37:40.018]  Hundreds of different vaccines.
[00:37:40.539 --> 00:37:53.655]  They're really biological re-engineering live viruses that they inject into your body and the live viruses go in and attack your brain.
[00:37:54.676 --> 00:37:56.699]  And they claim, oh, it's to stop drug addiction.
[00:37:58.188 --> 00:38:04.532]  Those same receptor sites that pick up opiates and nicotine and alcohol pick up your normal endorphins.
[00:38:04.973 --> 00:38:06.894]  It's part of being a normal human being.
[00:38:07.154 --> 00:38:08.435]  Those drugs mimic that.
[00:38:08.735 --> 00:38:13.939]  And the viruses attack those receptor sites and kill them and create dead tissue.
[00:38:14.499 --> 00:38:19.782]  It is a vaccine-induced live virus lobotomy.
[00:38:20.403 --> 00:38:24.646]  Now, they're coming out and saying the American people and the people of the world are sick.
[00:38:25.046 --> 00:38:28.028]  And major medical journals are saying we need to give everybody these shots.
[00:38:28.749 --> 00:38:29.990]  To make them feel better.
[00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:31.591]  To stop having anxiety.
[00:38:31.931 --> 00:38:33.293]  To stop being angry.
[00:38:34.153 --> 00:38:39.478]  In other words, to take away your instinct for self-preservation.
[00:38:39.878 --> 00:38:41.700]  Your will to survive.
[00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:44.563]  To make you accept all the bad things that are happening.
[00:38:44.603 --> 00:38:46.704]  To turn you into a biological android.
[00:38:47.125 --> 00:38:48.246]  A type of zombie.
[00:38:48.326 --> 00:38:50.248]  You cannot make this up!
[00:38:51.769 --> 00:38:54.070]  Please, send this video to everyone you know.
[00:38:54.170 --> 00:38:57.411]  For God's sakes, understand how serious this is.
[00:38:57.431 --> 00:39:01.752]  This is a global, scientific, corporate takeover of life itself.
[00:39:02.193 --> 00:39:07.614]  The globalists aren't just re-engineering corn and wheat and every other major crop, and engineering steroids into them.
[00:39:08.215 --> 00:39:08.695]  Suddenly...
[00:39:09.475 --> 00:39:14.980]  All over the news they're promoting lithium and Prozac and other drugs in the water.
[00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:17.402]  Head bioethicist at Cambridge.
[00:39:17.742 --> 00:39:21.285]  They're the people that advise and set medical policy for doctors.
[00:39:21.805 --> 00:39:26.169]  Are announcing they want to force drug you and they're calling it cognitive enhancement.
[00:39:26.849 --> 00:39:31.653]  I've got a CBS news piece where they say that mercury helps your intelligence.
[00:39:31.693 --> 00:39:33.515]  What everyone knows it causes brain damage.
[00:39:33.795 --> 00:39:39.801]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the Journal of Pediatrics.
[00:39:40.402 --> 00:39:45.547]  So when they say cognitive enhancement, they mean cognitive brain damage.
[00:39:45.867 --> 00:39:50.852]  They mean taking your essence, literally your psyche, who you are away.
[00:39:51.613 --> 00:39:55.635]  And they sit up there saying, well, if we put Prozac in the water, it'll cut suicide.
[00:39:55.915 --> 00:39:59.336]  When it's admitted that Prozac, on its insert, can cause suicide.
[00:39:59.756 --> 00:40:06.759]  I have mainstream news articles that have just come out in the last few days in England, where people have a tenfold increase in convulsions.
[00:40:07.099 --> 00:40:10.080]  And they develop epilepsy after the flu shot.
[00:40:10.741 --> 00:40:18.724]  I talked to top scientists who studied the flu shot last year and found bizarre viral RNA in it that deals with the brain.
[00:40:19.324 --> 00:40:28.149]  I've had top brain surgeons on, like Dr. Russell Blaylock, to talk about this, and the government documents that he's read, how this is part of a eugenics population control program.
[00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:29.270]  I mean, here it is!
[00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:30.891]  London Telegraph.
[00:40:31.211 --> 00:40:33.312]  Flu jab linked to fits and under 5s.
[00:40:34.353 --> 00:40:42.678]  And it goes on to say they've been told not to give children 110,000 in England under 5 the shot, because they had convulsions at 10 times the regular rate.
[00:40:43.703 --> 00:40:45.344]  Lindsay Lohan isn't what matters.
[00:40:46.285 --> 00:40:47.687]  Mel Gibson isn't what matters.
[00:40:48.547 --> 00:40:50.069]  The Depression doesn't even matter.
[00:40:50.129 --> 00:40:55.453]  War with Iran is not even that important, compared to a medical dictatorship.
[00:40:55.573 --> 00:41:06.803]  And under the National Health Service in England, and now National Health Care here in the US, they're slashing regular health care, like cancer surgery, or having a broken leg fixed, and converting it over to psychiatry.
[00:41:07.244 --> 00:41:10.547]  And this biological warfare, or biopsychiatry,
[00:41:11.027 --> 00:41:13.769]  Or they say, don't worry about drugs anymore for your depression.
[00:41:14.069 --> 00:41:21.054]  We're going to give you a shot that alters your brain by viruses literally attacking your brain.
[00:41:21.354 --> 00:41:24.236]  And they're rolling it out in public trials.
[00:41:24.656 --> 00:41:27.598]  Over a hundred of these vaccines right now.
[00:41:27.898 --> 00:41:30.580]  And they're clearly spiking other vaccines with it.
[00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:38.966]  If you love your children, if you love your family, you've got to realize this is a creeping, scientific, incremental, soft kill system.
[00:41:39.546 --> 00:41:40.827]  Let's go over some of these articles.
[00:41:41.947 --> 00:41:45.949]  Jabs that could put a stop to stress without slowing us down.
[00:41:46.469 --> 00:41:48.270]  And it says they're going to make humans better.
[00:41:48.290 --> 00:41:50.770]  They've re-engineered potatoes and corn.
[00:41:51.431 --> 00:41:53.351]  Why not just re-engineer humans?
[00:41:53.831 --> 00:41:58.553]  And they quote all these major medical journals saying how great it is.
[00:41:59.053 --> 00:42:02.855]  And they say this could change society, the professor said.
[00:42:03.115 --> 00:42:09.317]  And they have a government-funded Stanford team with these neuroprotective viruses.
[00:42:10.037 --> 00:42:19.821]  And this particular vaccine, one of hundreds, is a live herpes virus engineered to only eat certain key brain tissue.
[00:42:19.841 --> 00:42:21.682]  What's wrong?
[00:42:21.762 --> 00:42:22.782]  Nothing, nothing really.
[00:42:23.382 --> 00:42:25.103]  I just feel that I need something stronger.
[00:42:26.778 --> 00:42:30.062]  If you have a problem, don't hesitate to ask for assistance.
[00:42:30.082 --> 00:42:30.623]  Yes, thank you.
[00:42:30.743 --> 00:42:32.505]  I'll be alright.
[00:42:32.545 --> 00:42:34.107]  Call 348... They're not asking you.
[00:42:34.548 --> 00:42:35.549]  They're just rolling it out.
[00:42:35.889 --> 00:42:42.537]  And this isn't like some drug that they give people for a decade that causes hundreds of thousands of women to have deformed children.
[00:42:43.178 --> 00:42:46.621]  This isn't some drug that just makes one person, you know, have a heart attack.
[00:42:47.102 --> 00:42:49.804]  All these other recall drugs, these aren't even drugs.
[00:42:49.924 --> 00:42:59.353]  These are genetically engineered nanotech viruses that go in and turn you into a servile biological android.
[00:42:59.653 --> 00:43:00.834]  Do you understand?
[00:43:00.854 --> 00:43:08.761]  The vaccines that they're rolling out are live virus bioweapons that re-engineer your brain.
[00:43:09.690 --> 00:43:19.632]  You've seen the reports where all over the world, Asia, Africa, Latin America, Central Asia, they give children UN-sanctioned polio shots.
[00:43:20.272 --> 00:43:23.792]  And the children come down with weaponized polio and die.
[00:43:24.032 --> 00:43:26.613]  And the government admits, oh, it was an accident with that vaccine.
[00:43:27.093 --> 00:43:31.974]  People are now waking up to the fact that the vaccines are causing convulsions and brain damage and cancer.
[00:43:32.314 --> 00:43:33.334]  And so what's their answer?
[00:43:33.574 --> 00:43:35.174]  They're coming out and saying, don't worry.
[00:43:35.715 --> 00:43:38.055]  Instead of a shot, have a banana.
[00:43:39.295 --> 00:43:39.956]  They're coming out.
[00:43:40.096 --> 00:43:44.559]  Nobel laureate scientist defines future vaccines as food.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.524]  They're pharmacological crops that grow the live virus.
[00:43:49.544 --> 00:43:57.811]  Whether it gives you cancer, or gives you polio, or literally sends viruses in to eat parts of your brain, it's all being done.
[00:43:58.131 --> 00:44:03.656]  Bill Gates is coming out with a biologically engineered mosquito to forcibly deliver vaccines to you.
[00:44:04.336 --> 00:44:05.977]  There's no drug discovery going on.
[00:44:05.997 --> 00:44:11.080]  Our foundation has backed a vaccine that's going into phase 3 trial that starts in a couple months.
[00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:15.242]  And that should save over two-thirds of lives if it's effective.
[00:44:15.842 --> 00:44:20.244]  And most sickeningly, over and over again they claim, oh it's to make you not depressed anymore.
[00:44:20.344 --> 00:44:21.305]  All of you have problems.
[00:44:21.565 --> 00:44:23.046]  You shouldn't be upset about things.
[00:44:23.106 --> 00:44:26.748]  No, we're meant to get upset at a biological level and say no to this tyranny.
[00:44:27.728 --> 00:44:31.510]  And so they're coming out saying, oh, we're going to re-engineer your brain, cognitive enhancements.
[00:44:31.810 --> 00:44:33.211]  We're going to help you.
[00:44:33.591 --> 00:44:37.413]  The mercury's helping your brain on newscasts all over the country.
[00:44:38.113 --> 00:44:40.655]  Oh, the convulsions are helping you.
[00:44:40.675 --> 00:44:44.597]  Oh, lithium, a toxic metal that they want to put in the water.
[00:44:44.737 --> 00:44:46.197]  It's helping you.
[00:44:46.658 --> 00:44:49.579]  You're going to feel much better after all of this is done.
[00:44:49.599 --> 00:44:50.800]  What's wrong?
[00:44:54.821 --> 00:44:56.102]  They're not coming for us.
[00:44:56.262 --> 00:44:57.823]  They're already here.
[00:44:58.163 --> 00:44:59.123]  We're in danger.
[00:44:59.664 --> 00:45:06.888]  Many of you who have a child who seems to be dumbed down and isn't as smart as anybody else in your family, and something's wrong with them.
[00:45:07.008 --> 00:45:07.929]  It's the vaccines.
[00:45:07.989 --> 00:45:09.049]  It's the GMO food.
[00:45:09.489 --> 00:45:14.072]  Many of you who had an 18-month-old baby who was healthy and happy, they take that third round of shots.
[00:45:14.112 --> 00:45:16.894]  They have a convulsion that night, and they never talk again.
[00:45:17.194 --> 00:45:23.758]  They're turning you into servile minions who will do whatever you're told and who can't get angry and can't resist.
[00:45:24.338 --> 00:45:25.778]  Why do they want lithium in the water?
[00:45:25.918 --> 00:45:27.219]  They admit to make you submit.
[00:45:27.659 --> 00:45:29.419]  What does sodium fluoride in all the studies do?
[00:45:29.779 --> 00:45:30.619]  Make you submit.
[00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:32.580]  And what do these vaccines do?
[00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:34.000]  They make you passive.
[00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:35.801]  They make you unable to get angry.
[00:45:36.261 --> 00:45:39.661]  Anger is a propulsion system to make you stand up for your species.
[00:45:40.081 --> 00:45:46.523]  This is a hostile corporate takeover of the very genetic code of not just the plants and animals, but humanity itself.
[00:45:46.683 --> 00:45:50.844]  It is the most diabolical, covert operation ever seen.
[00:45:51.664 --> 00:45:54.826]  And now these people are out in the open.
[00:45:55.466 --> 00:45:56.187]  It's admitted.
[00:45:56.287 --> 00:45:57.468]  Do you understand?
[00:45:57.608 --> 00:45:58.248]  It's admitted.
[00:45:58.528 --> 00:46:03.731]  They want to make these shots mandatory in public schools to make you servile.
[00:46:04.031 --> 00:46:06.053]  Oh, but you don't want to become addicted to drugs.
[00:46:06.373 --> 00:46:07.754]  What do you think drugs mimic?
[00:46:07.814 --> 00:46:13.017]  They mimic natural chemicals in the brain that stir creativity and anger and
[00:46:13.417 --> 00:46:15.139]  Love and everything else.
[00:46:15.439 --> 00:46:17.001]  It's those key receptors.
[00:46:17.221 --> 00:46:20.284]  They're literally going for the soul of man.
[00:46:20.524 --> 00:46:26.810]  That is in the beautiful, detailed, complex computer that is the human mind.
[00:46:27.090 --> 00:46:28.972]  This is a hack against the human mind.
[00:46:29.292 --> 00:46:32.633]  It's a hack against the human soul and we must stand up and resist it.
[00:46:33.013 --> 00:46:38.714]  They realize there's a worldwide revolt against this technocracy, against dehumanization.
[00:46:39.135 --> 00:46:45.496]  You need to become educated on these facts and join the resistance against this scientific dictatorship.
[00:46:45.856 --> 00:46:50.238]  Now is the time to realize that history is taking place right now.
[00:46:50.578 --> 00:46:55.579]  That we're living in the 21st century and a scientific tyranny has taken over.
[00:46:57.376 --> 00:46:59.392]  If we are successful in defeating these people.
[00:47:00.748 --> 00:47:05.472]  Historians will look back on this time as the greatest covert genocide in history.
[00:47:05.772 --> 00:47:11.777]  They will look back on it as the ultimate example of pure evil and corruption.
[00:47:12.077 --> 00:47:13.098]  This creeping death.
[00:47:13.618 --> 00:47:17.181]  Now I've warned the public, and I will continue to detail what's happening.
[00:47:17.201 --> 00:47:27.249]  In areas where lithium in trace amounts is in the drinking water, there seems to be a lower level of suicidality, and in the Texas counties that were studied, there's actually a lower crime rate.
[00:47:27.489 --> 00:47:38.659]  Now these enemies come out and talk in their simpering, lisping tones real softly to coax you and advertise all this death and dehumanization as if it's good.
[00:47:38.679 --> 00:47:44.404]  The theory is that very low or trace amounts of lithium enhance connectivity between neurons.
[00:47:45.065 --> 00:47:49.549]  And doing that over the course of a lifetime, a lifetime exposure, makes the brain more healthy.
[00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:58.204]  Now I want to talk to the social engineers whose religion is a control freak system of dehumanization.
[00:47:59.645 --> 00:48:00.745]  You are like cancer.
[00:48:00.865 --> 00:48:02.626]  You're racing through the body politic.
[00:48:02.666 --> 00:48:03.847]  You think you're invincible.
[00:48:04.728 --> 00:48:05.988]  And you may kill the host.
[00:48:06.068 --> 00:48:07.449]  You may destroy our species.
[00:48:08.210 --> 00:48:09.250]  But not without a fight.
[00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:13.973]  You are disgusting, wicked people who love ruling over others.
[00:48:14.513 --> 00:48:17.315]  Everything you do creates death and destruction in its path.
[00:48:17.915 --> 00:48:22.878]  You sold Prozac as a way to stop depression when in your own trials you knew it massively increased suicide.
[00:48:23.478 --> 00:48:30.421]  Now you're telling us how great lithium, a toxic metal, an anti-psychotic is gonna be, put in the water mandatory.
[00:48:31.042 --> 00:48:34.323]  We've got the studies, it's already in most of the water supplies, we know you're adding it.
[00:48:34.784 --> 00:48:37.265]  You are sickening, disgusting filth.
[00:48:38.336 --> 00:48:42.301]  And we're going to rally the world population against you and we're going to bring you to justice.
[00:48:43.223 --> 00:48:46.988]  And I pray God that humanity makes it through what you've attempted to do.
[00:48:47.008 --> 00:48:54.037]  How you've saddled up next to us like a spider in the dark and tried to spin your webs of control around us while we were asleep.
[00:48:54.798 --> 00:48:59.001]  But the sleeping giant that is humanity is waking up to who you are and what you are.
[00:48:59.021 --> 00:49:13.209]  And I pray to the creator of the universe and I beg for just the average person out there as well to research just who you are and how you're involved in a scorched earth takeover of society to secure your ill-gotten gains.
[00:49:13.729 --> 00:49:20.873]  And I want you to know that I'm going to do everything I can to rally free humanity against you and that we are going to defeat you.
[00:49:21.454 --> 00:49:23.095]  But whether we win or not,
[00:49:23.795 --> 00:49:27.299]  Whether you lose or fail, at least we were real humans.
[00:49:27.519 --> 00:49:31.363]  We were good, decent people that saw the truth and we stood up against you.
[00:49:31.843 --> 00:49:37.589]  And no matter what happens in this, you are still degenerate, dehumanizing filth.
[00:49:38.370 --> 00:49:41.293]  You are aberrant, malfunctioning trash.
[00:49:41.713 --> 00:49:45.697]  And you look at everything good and wholesome and tell us that we are malfunctioning.
[00:49:46.738 --> 00:49:57.401]  So I pray that you be defeated, but either way, in this time and space, on this planet, good people stood up against what you are, and did everything they could to help the innocents.
[00:49:57.941 --> 00:50:07.203]  When I look at all the children that you've brain damaged, and all the children dying of cancer, and I look at all the things that you've done to humanity, it makes me want to vomit!
[00:50:07.663 --> 00:50:17.306]  You are doing this because this is only the next wave to first neutralize us so we're calm and sedate and can't resist so you can roll in with the hard kill weapons.
[00:50:17.666 --> 00:50:18.206]  I know that.
[00:50:18.666 --> 00:50:19.827]  And I want to tell you something else.
[00:50:20.687 --> 00:50:27.589]  A lot of you that think that you're part of the winning team, you're going to find out that your masters hate you more than they even hate free humanity.
[00:50:28.169 --> 00:50:37.042]  Because they know that you know where the bodies are buried, and they know you're a bunch of wicked control freaks that they need to kill first once they take over, or you'll start trying to overthrow them.
[00:50:37.322 --> 00:50:38.684]  They understand your nature.
[00:50:39.065 --> 00:50:43.631]  They use their propaganda to manipulate good men throughout history to serve their evil aims.
[00:50:44.392 --> 00:50:45.333]  So understand this.
[00:50:45.893 --> 00:50:47.694]  You're going to fail one way or another.
[00:50:47.894 --> 00:51:00.701]  You've decided to put your soul on the side of darkness for all eternity for what you're doing to humanity and butchering our DNA and literally mutating the human spirit and your control freak lust for power.
[00:51:01.281 --> 00:51:04.303]  And so all of you, one way or another, will fail.
[00:51:04.823 --> 00:51:08.545]  So all that matters is, in this time and space, I stood up for what's right.
[00:51:08.846 --> 00:51:10.847]  I saw you clearly for what you are.
[00:51:11.747 --> 00:51:17.852]  And I know in my heart there's a very good chance we're gonna beat you, but that's up to all the people out there watching this.
[00:51:18.353 --> 00:51:20.114]  Do they have the courage to face the facts?
[00:51:20.375 --> 00:51:22.697]  Do they have the courage to take action?
[00:51:22.837 --> 00:51:30.223]  If you feel you are not properly sedated, call 348-844-IMMEDIATELY.
[00:51:30.483 --> 00:51:36.048]  Failure to do so may result in prosecution for criminal drug evasion.
[00:51:44.325 --> 00:51:46.620]  Yeah.
[00:52:06.112 --> 00:52:11.635]  We are back in the middle of this InfoWars Money Bomb Marathon Transmission.
[00:52:12.075 --> 00:52:12.856]  I'm Aaron Dykes.
[00:52:13.016 --> 00:52:14.737]  Alex will be back later in the morning.
[00:52:14.837 --> 00:52:16.678]  Paul Joseph Watson is coming up.
[00:52:17.078 --> 00:52:20.179]  Lots more special guests, other special videos.
[00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:24.742]  That was brain-eating vaccines and how true it is what Alex said.
[00:52:25.342 --> 00:52:32.946]  That what matters is what we do in this time, that we saw them for what they are in this time, right here and right now.
[00:52:33.307 --> 00:52:37.449]  And this is a very, very important time in history, if you don't realize it.
[00:52:37.749 --> 00:52:44.113]  There's been an entire continuity of how people never had information, never had access to the power of information.
[00:52:44.533 --> 00:52:52.898]  All these secret societies and occultic entities, the priest class, they were the ones who had the written information, the other continuity.
[00:52:54.019 --> 00:52:55.400]  Do we just lose this transmit?
[00:52:55.961 --> 00:52:56.462]  We're still here.
[00:52:57.423 --> 00:53:05.133]  They held the information gradually and through various processes, we've become able to get some of that information.
[00:53:05.213 --> 00:53:06.895]  What are we going to do with it while we have it?
[00:53:06.935 --> 00:53:08.898]  This is such an important time in history.
[00:53:09.298 --> 00:53:25.888]  As we transition into this total technological information age, and you've seen the quotes of people like Bertrand Russell, one of the top globalist strategists, and he really predicted the mother of all tyrannies coming out of the scientific technological revolution.
[00:53:26.548 --> 00:53:35.093]  How it would allow a total dictatorship even greater than all the worst tyrannies you saw in the 20th century who killed millions and millions of people.
[00:53:35.493 --> 00:53:56.190]  But right now, in this time, with the power of the internet, with our ability to read and write, and those of us who can still cogitate a thought, even though it's in the middle of the night, 3.30 in the morning here, you can barely string a sentence, I'm still able to think, and that is a revolution in its own right, and we have to all get out there and use the energy we have.
[00:53:56.550 --> 00:54:04.137]  We do ask that you help support this operation, help us grow, help us reach more minds, unlock them, and let them have the information too.
[00:54:04.657 --> 00:54:14.821]  So we can hopefully reach a tipping point, stop this thing, transform whatever's coming in the future into something a little less tyrannical, if not outright win.
[00:54:14.861 --> 00:54:19.682]  Back to the 1776 point in time where they enshrined individual liberties.
[00:54:19.762 --> 00:54:24.264]  The Bill of Rights is such an important moment in history, as is the Constitution.
[00:54:24.684 --> 00:54:26.785]  Now on the other end of the
[00:54:27.405 --> 00:54:30.007]  Skype slash phone line we have Rick Warden.
[00:54:30.047 --> 00:54:32.389]  That's someone who is doing something in his time.
[00:54:32.789 --> 00:54:56.825]  He has continuously participated in occupy the Fed a Movement within the larger occupied movement trying to focus attention on the real enemy One of the most central parts of the real enemy the Federal Reserve private banking system that occupies us all we're trying to reverse that and occupy them and in their power he's been in Dallas outside the Fed for
[00:54:57.505 --> 00:54:59.207]  It's good to be on.
[00:54:59.267 --> 00:55:05.472]  With Occupy the Fed Dallas or Occupy Movement period?
[00:55:16.798 --> 00:55:17.939]  Okay, well fantastic.
[00:55:18.019 --> 00:55:22.602]  I'll start with Occupy the Fed Dallas since that's where my real, real, you know, heart is.
[00:55:24.163 --> 00:55:33.449]  It's funny how I kind of positioned my whole life here in the last six months so that I could pursue my art, my music and my art.
[00:55:33.969 --> 00:55:42.895]  And so it left me, you know, with time to do this with Occupy the Fed Dallas and then now what I am doing involved with Occupy Dallas.
[00:55:43.335 --> 00:55:45.977]  So Occupy the Fed, this Saturday,
[00:55:46.517 --> 00:55:51.801]  In the Fed, the official organization here, the local DFW chapter is Debbie McKee.
[00:55:52.322 --> 00:55:54.623]  They are throwing a rally or having a rally.
[00:55:54.643 --> 00:55:56.885]  It is Guy Fawkes Saturday.
[00:55:57.145 --> 00:56:00.088]  Remember, remember the 5th of November.
[00:56:00.648 --> 00:56:04.091]  And so we're going to have fun with our masks this Saturday.
[00:56:04.731 --> 00:56:06.372]  At the Federal Reserve Bank.
[00:56:06.753 --> 00:56:11.096]  The In the Fed will be there from 10 in the morning till 12 noon.
[00:56:11.556 --> 00:56:14.398]  But several of us are going to stay all day and have a great time.
[00:56:14.438 --> 00:56:21.443]  So y'all coming out to the Fed in Dallas on North Pearl and Good Latimer.
[00:56:22.702 --> 00:56:28.927]  And for those who are not in the Texas area, there are Federal Reserve locations all across the country.
[00:56:29.287 --> 00:56:37.533]  There's 12 main branches in addition to the sort of central one in Washington D.C., the Board of Governors location.
[00:56:38.114 --> 00:56:41.796]  And you can check the maps we posted before on Infowars.com.
[00:56:41.876 --> 00:56:43.738]  Dallas is the headquarters for
[00:56:44.158 --> 00:56:44.518]  I don't know.
[00:57:04.311 --> 00:57:07.792]  Uh, the latest and greatest, uh, depression going on here.
[00:57:07.812 --> 00:57:16.473]  Uh, and we know the Great Depression of the 1930s, uh, was also, uh, instigated by the Federal Reserve and its related powers.
[00:57:16.493 --> 00:57:29.996]  Uh, among other things, they concentrated the money supply and really put the squeeze on, uh, a little plan they had to gear us into the collectivist models they had, uh, not only in the U.S., but throughout Europe and the rest of the world.
[00:57:31.255 --> 00:57:41.683]  Yeah, we were just watching a video, Ed Occupy Dallas, that went over the Fed really well.
[00:57:41.703 --> 00:57:45.946]  It was the addendum to the series.
[00:57:46.386 --> 00:57:48.548]  Either way, basically you're correct.
[00:57:48.588 --> 00:57:53.111]  In 1913, these crooks took advantage and took control of the financial
[00:57:53.131 --> 00:57:53.491]  I don't
[00:58:09.592 --> 00:58:20.302]  Um, but you know, here's the great thing, is that there's good in all things, there's negative in all things as well, and you can have fun in the face of tyranny here in 2011.
[00:58:20.882 --> 00:58:24.605]  You can go out to the Federal Reserve Bank any day and I would encourage you to.
[00:58:26.787 --> 00:58:38.310]  A time like Saturday where we're going to have a lot of people coming out, especially in your local city if there is a Federal Reserve Bank, surely there's going to be people coming out enjoying Guy Fawkes Saturday.
[00:58:38.930 --> 00:58:45.552]  And even if you're a little intimidated and you don't really know all about this, you know, if you're compelled to go, go.
[00:58:46.012 --> 00:58:55.255]  You'll meet wonderful people, you'll make relationships that'll last a lifetime with like-minded people, and you'll be able to disseminate information and that's what it's all about.
[00:58:56.633 --> 00:59:11.083]  Rick, what have you continued to see with the larger Occupy movement, not only there in Dallas, but what is the significance, you know, what is it two months later or at least several, several weeks later of this movement as it continues on one front or another?
[00:59:11.523 --> 00:59:13.364]  What is its overall significance?
[00:59:13.625 --> 00:59:19.769]  And the question I really think that goes with that, though, is do they have a global financial solution waiting?
[00:59:20.569 --> 00:59:24.612]  We know for years there's been talk of the dollar losing its reserve status.
[00:59:25.473 --> 00:59:30.316]  Do Soros and company have a sort of new global standard waiting in the wings?
[00:59:30.396 --> 00:59:32.738]  Is that what their Bretton Woods 2 meeting was all about?
[00:59:33.438 --> 00:59:35.840]  What do you think about some of those topics?
[00:59:36.698 --> 00:59:42.863]  Well, obviously they have a global financial standard that they have in waiting that they're going to force everybody into.
[00:59:42.923 --> 00:59:51.350]  That's obviously the, you know, the answer to this global crisis as a global currency and surely backed with
[00:59:53.332 --> 01:00:00.398]  You know, more global governance, more security on our behalf, more invasion into our privacy.
[01:00:00.839 --> 01:00:10.808]  It doesn't seem like that would be possible, but that's obviously their plan, is they want more control, and they'll get that through this new global currency if they have their way.
[01:00:11.428 --> 01:00:15.110]  Now back to the Occupy Dallas though, or the Occupy movement.
[01:00:16.010 --> 01:00:18.011]  You know, it's really interesting.
[01:00:18.031 --> 01:00:24.614]  I would like to first and foremost encourage people just to think, you know, chill for a little bit and think about what's going on.
[01:00:25.434 --> 01:00:31.057]  Any movement that has ever existed has had all kinds of sides to it.
[01:00:32.317 --> 01:00:37.900]  One of the issues that we have at Occupy Dallas right now, I do media, and I believe in independent media.
[01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:50.332]  Well, they have a need to have a lot of their media censored, if you will, or go through the Occupy Dallas group so that it reflects upon Occupy Dallas.
[01:00:50.852 --> 01:00:53.355]  I think that's great for that part of the
[01:00:53.895 --> 01:01:07.462]  Media outlet but Independent media people are gonna be the ones that will really tell the real story of what happens at Occupy Dallas So that's my goal right now.
[01:01:07.562 --> 01:01:22.350]  My heart is on teaching people how to use their cell phones to make videos and Instantaneously up those videos to YouTube and have instant news reporting on the ground at Occupy Dallas
[01:01:23.635 --> 01:01:25.217]  I've said it before and I'll say it again.
[01:01:25.297 --> 01:01:32.524]  Now is the time, whether it's using this electronic media to broadcast almost instantly or just getting out there.
[01:01:32.544 --> 01:01:37.089]  This is the time in history where if we're gonna make a difference, we're gonna make it now.
[01:01:37.809 --> 01:01:40.632]  And that's why we're doing this InfoWars Money Bomb to try to grow.
[01:01:40.993 --> 01:01:46.879]  That's why we're telling people to get out on the streets and reach people while everyone's focused on these issues.
[01:01:47.539 --> 01:01:50.101]  But they always have a global solution for everything.
[01:01:50.502 --> 01:01:54.205]  At the same time though, we've seen everything that's looming in Europe.
[01:01:55.005 --> 01:01:58.968]  Greece has at least floated the idea of reprinting the Drakma.
[01:01:59.409 --> 01:02:04.433]  I know Germany has rumored to have the Deutsche Mark ready to go.
[01:02:04.953 --> 01:02:08.235]  In the case of euro collapse, why is it always a global solution?
[01:02:08.855 --> 01:02:10.537]  I've heard about countries like Argentina.
[01:02:10.557 --> 01:02:11.457]  It's late at night.
[01:02:11.557 --> 01:02:12.798]  I don't know if I mixed the facts.
[01:02:13.218 --> 01:02:15.500]  But they returned to their currency.
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:17.020]  It was devalued.
[01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:17.901]  It wasn't worth much.
[01:02:18.681 --> 01:02:19.682]  Their economy crashed.
[01:02:19.742 --> 01:02:22.084]  But they also recovered in just about a year.
[01:02:22.584 --> 01:02:24.065]  And then they were stronger than ever.
[01:02:24.125 --> 01:02:29.508]  Why is it always a greater global solution we're pushed into when obviously there could be other solutions?
[01:02:29.568 --> 01:02:34.111]  I'm not saying returning to the drachma where the Deutsche Mark is best for the world.
[01:02:34.591 --> 01:02:37.472]  But, uh, it's time to look at these things, I think.
[01:02:38.272 --> 01:02:41.694]  Well, Aaron, it's about control is what it's about ultimately.
[01:02:42.294 --> 01:02:45.995]  And the easiest thing in life is self-provision.
[01:02:46.355 --> 01:03:00.581]  The reason why providing for yourself is so easy is because it's actually ordered into nature, or ordered into the universe, just like air, oxygen that we breathe, or water that we drink.
[01:03:01.281 --> 01:03:05.145]  Um, food also is ordered into nature in the same type of way.
[01:03:05.646 --> 01:03:17.237]  And what these people, the way that you, you know, when you really understand how great the evils that they're capable of, it's when you figure out that, you know, they really killed our food.
[01:03:17.717 --> 01:03:18.658]  They killed our food.
[01:03:18.718 --> 01:03:23.504]  We should have or we could have pomegranates growing in our cities.
[01:03:23.584 --> 01:03:25.406]  We could have pomegranate trees.
[01:03:25.766 --> 01:03:27.508]  We have pecan trees growing.
[01:03:27.788 --> 01:03:34.176]  There's no reason why we shouldn't have readily access to food just like you do oxygen and water.
[01:03:35.031 --> 01:03:40.073]  Yeah but instead they have weaponized it just as Kissinger talked about in the 70s in a different context.
[01:03:40.413 --> 01:03:47.316]  They've weaponized the food through the GMOs and all the additives and little little bonus chemicals they put in our water and our air supply.
[01:03:47.757 --> 01:03:50.178]  It's true what you said yeah we should have a right to food and
[01:03:51.178 --> 01:03:59.741]  It really should be a natural part of our lives, but instead, they've sold us on the dehumanization and got us to accept the tyranny on our own right.
[01:03:59.781 --> 01:04:06.784]  You know, we just played the video, brain-eating vaccines, and in it there's some clips from THX 1138, George Lucas's film.
[01:04:07.244 --> 01:04:10.505]  And that's about a new world order system and a future technocracy.
[01:04:10.925 --> 01:04:15.327]  And really the whole metaphor is, yes, there's a ruling class, but you never see them in the film.
[01:04:15.707 --> 01:04:16.627]  They're off screen.
[01:04:16.947 --> 01:04:18.288]  What really happened was the people
[01:04:19.497 --> 01:04:22.539]  Enslaved themselves the people built up the system.
[01:04:22.579 --> 01:04:39.890]  They built the robots that Regulate them and they bought into this drugging themselves to suppress their own humanity In the film the characters start to change When they stop taking the drugs and they return to their normal sexual behavior and their normal thoughts and and that's what really becomes revolutionary Rick
[01:04:41.058 --> 01:04:48.665]  Well, it's hard to say, Aaron, if that would, you know, that obviously exists in human nature, that type of tension.
[01:04:49.026 --> 01:04:55.412]  If there's good and bad in everything, or positive and negative in everything, then there's this tension between the two.
[01:04:55.952 --> 01:04:56.493]  And so, um...
[01:04:57.914 --> 01:05:23.183]  I believe that these social engineers, or the people who designed this multiple-pronged deceptive program, they obviously recognize that to some extent, that there was this nature within us where we just would not want to accept the truth, or we just would not be interested enough in truth and reality to want to, you know,
[01:05:23.823 --> 01:05:28.607]  Not only not fight for it, but just to kind of go along and even give up your rights.
[01:05:29.267 --> 01:05:30.328]  And here's a good example.
[01:05:30.388 --> 01:05:32.490]  As a prime example, bring up Occupy Dallas.
[01:05:33.030 --> 01:05:36.293]  I keep bringing up Occupy Dallas because, folks, I've been sleeping over there.
[01:05:36.333 --> 01:05:38.074]  My tent's been up there for a week now.
[01:05:38.454 --> 01:05:41.357]  And so I've got a real good handle on what's going on there.
[01:05:41.977 --> 01:05:50.704]  And in that microcosm, you have everything that you have in the real world, just kind of in a smaller little microcosm.
[01:05:51.144 --> 01:05:53.626]  So you have people there that I
[01:05:53.906 --> 01:05:59.189]  You know, they just want to give up their rights for the greater good of the whole cause.
[01:05:59.970 --> 01:06:03.412]  And then there's this other group of people, and it's about 50-50 now.
[01:06:03.772 --> 01:06:13.038]  There's this other group of people that are First Amendmenters, meaning that we know that the First Amendment recognizes our existing right just to be.
[01:06:13.478 --> 01:06:18.941]  And sometimes just being is enough because we are powerful, wonderful creatures.
[01:06:19.361 --> 01:06:20.642]  And that's what they're against.
[01:06:20.702 --> 01:06:23.304]  They're against this system that's been designed
[01:06:23.864 --> 01:06:28.148]  The banking system, the financial system, the food, the medicine, the war, the drugs.
[01:06:28.648 --> 01:06:35.874]  All of it's designed to come against that natural design of you just being.
[01:06:36.094 --> 01:06:40.698]  And just being is enough because when you're being, you're assimilating truth.
[01:06:41.059 --> 01:06:44.441]  You're in that context of assimilating truth.
[01:06:44.802 --> 01:06:46.543]  Truth does something magical.
[01:06:46.763 --> 01:06:49.806]  Truth inspires us and encourages us.
[01:06:50.206 --> 01:06:52.868]  Which, another word for those, are strengthens us.
[01:06:53.249 --> 01:07:00.775]  So there really is a strengthening process in just hanging out, having good conversations about truth and reality.
[01:07:01.276 --> 01:07:12.125]  And so, that's the way that I see the program that they've designed, this deception program or this brainwashing program, is that it's really all designed to keep you down.
[01:07:12.965 --> 01:07:18.090]  And that's the evidence that they recognize that you're actually a very powerful person.
[01:07:18.510 --> 01:07:19.511]  Oh, I couldn't agree more.
[01:07:19.711 --> 01:07:20.812]  That's really what it's all about.
[01:07:20.832 --> 01:07:24.376]  They're trying to limit our consciousness because we're capable of so much.
[01:07:24.416 --> 01:07:27.879]  And of course, if things were left to ourselves, it would never be perfect.
[01:07:27.899 --> 01:07:33.245]  But we can figure out in our communities and amongst ourselves individually how to take care of ourselves.
[01:07:34.126 --> 01:07:35.587]  God has provided so much.
[01:07:35.687 --> 01:07:38.750]  Nature has provided so much that we can rely on.
[01:07:39.111 --> 01:07:41.353]  They've built up this whole false system of
[01:07:41.533 --> 01:07:41.973]  We're good.
[01:07:58.968 --> 01:07:59.388]  We're good to go.
[01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:20.321]  I don't know.
[01:08:34.537 --> 01:08:34.817]  I don't
[01:08:50.951 --> 01:08:51.552]  We don't give up.
[01:08:51.592 --> 01:08:53.634]  We have someone like Ron Paul run third party.
[01:08:53.654 --> 01:08:58.679]  We have people like Jesse Ventura talking about just simply operating outside of the left-right system.
[01:08:58.699 --> 01:09:02.123]  We have people standing up to the TSA and all the rest of it.
[01:09:02.163 --> 01:09:04.686]  I think it's a general Occupy spirit we need.
[01:09:05.227 --> 01:09:09.091]  I guess Gandhi put it into words, so did people like Henry David Thoreau, Rick Worden.
[01:09:10.538 --> 01:09:11.918]  Yes, thank you for the setup.
[01:09:13.279 --> 01:09:17.199]  If I can speak directly to your listeners about the Occupy Movement.
[01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:20.760]  InfoWAR listeners, by and large, are going to be First Amendment people.
[01:09:20.780 --> 01:09:22.160]  They're going to be lovers of liberty.
[01:09:22.860 --> 01:09:29.382]  And there is a place for your voice to be heard within the Occupy Movement.
[01:09:29.862 --> 01:09:35.803]  It's like any other thing, though, I wouldn't encourage you to expect to go down there, spend 15
[01:09:38.424 --> 01:09:42.887]  There are people that have been down there for days and weeks and going on a month now.
[01:09:43.287 --> 01:09:45.108]  So you have to invest some time.
[01:09:45.148 --> 01:09:47.229]  You have to be patient with the process.
[01:09:47.609 --> 01:09:53.212]  But I'll promise you, there is a place for your voice within the Occupy Movement.
[01:09:53.593 --> 01:09:54.493]  That's number one.
[01:09:54.953 --> 01:10:05.019]  Number two is that I would really appreciate, personally, your voice and your support along with me and other lovers of liberty within the Occupy Movement.
[01:10:05.499 --> 01:10:07.200]  And let me tell you why I'm saying this.
[01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:27.067]  What I'm experiencing on a daily basis is people that agree with me, agree with First Amendment issues, agree with just lovers of liberty, that ending the Fed or auditing the Fed is really at the top of our goal right now in our country.
[01:10:27.368 --> 01:10:28.128]  And these kind of things.
[01:10:28.188 --> 01:10:32.690]  People that are like-minded, they'll go down and they'll get frustrated with the process and leave.
[01:10:33.850 --> 01:10:35.110]  And I encourage them.
[01:10:35.130 --> 01:10:42.192]  I'm like, well, don't you understand you're taking all your wonderful ideas and your passion and you're leaving.
[01:10:42.252 --> 01:10:43.953]  You're not helping by leaving.
[01:10:43.973 --> 01:10:47.673]  Or maybe they are if they're pissed off and not having a good time.
[01:10:48.074 --> 01:10:53.395]  But my point is that there is a place for your voice within the Occupy movement.
[01:10:53.695 --> 01:10:59.536]  You might have to be a little patient, but if you have time and you're compelled to do so, please come on down.
[01:11:00.137 --> 01:11:01.677]  Let me give you another example, Aaron.
[01:11:02.538 --> 01:11:06.903]  The Hare Krishnas have made a name for themselves feeding a lot of the Occupy camps.
[01:11:07.443 --> 01:11:07.904]  It's true.
[01:11:08.104 --> 01:11:10.046]  They have some of the best, healthiest food.
[01:11:10.086 --> 01:11:12.589]  They come to the camp every day and they feed us.
[01:11:13.070 --> 01:11:13.550]  And you know what?
[01:11:13.610 --> 01:11:19.257]  Last Sunday, just out of appreciation, probably about 40 people from Occupy Dallas
[01:11:19.677 --> 01:11:24.201]  We attended the Hare Krishna service over here in Dallas on Sunday.
[01:11:24.762 --> 01:11:26.823]  Many of us dressed up in our Halloween garb.
[01:11:26.903 --> 01:11:30.787]  I was a zombie because we did a show on Saturday night where I dressed as a zombie.
[01:11:31.227 --> 01:11:37.813]  So I was dressed as a zombie, dancing in their ceremony and doing some Michael Jackson thriller type stuff, you know?
[01:11:38.193 --> 01:11:39.194]  And we had a great time.
[01:11:39.555 --> 01:11:42.877]  So my point is, is that, I mean, my goodness, if you got a bus,
[01:11:43.698 --> 01:11:45.119]  Go down there and pick up some people.
[01:11:45.159 --> 01:11:46.680]  Take them over to the Federal Reserve.
[01:11:47.781 --> 01:11:49.803]  You know, go love on some people.
[01:11:49.843 --> 01:11:52.405]  I promise you there's a place for your voice to be heard.
[01:11:52.485 --> 01:11:56.108]  There's a place for your actions to actually have an impact.
[01:11:57.864 --> 01:12:08.870]  Yeah, on the other side of that, I want to encourage people not only to go down to these places physically, but to move your energy, your assets, your aspirations into the right areas.
[01:12:08.890 --> 01:12:11.151]  There's another sense of the occupy term.
[01:12:11.871 --> 01:12:14.673]  I use it because it's been so well coined and it makes a lot of sense.
[01:12:15.093 --> 01:12:23.858]  Why occupy your spare energy into these dying systems, into these systems that by participating in them, you participate in your own slavery.
[01:12:24.278 --> 01:12:32.163]  You've seen people moving their money out of banks, out of these globalist banks into smaller credit unions and so forth.
[01:12:32.223 --> 01:12:33.244]  That makes a lot of sense.
[01:12:33.304 --> 01:12:35.766]  But do it in all areas of your life.
[01:12:36.466 --> 01:12:37.707]  You can't do it all at once.
[01:12:38.107 --> 01:12:39.388]  None of us need to be hypocrites.
[01:12:39.408 --> 01:12:41.630]  We all participate in some things that are negative.
[01:12:42.230 --> 01:12:52.114]  We need to try to move what energy and resources and finances we can into the things we believe in, and that goes along with the concept of voting with your dollars.
[01:12:52.494 --> 01:12:58.136]  You want to try to fund independent businesses that you believe in, and that goes for InfoWars too.
[01:12:58.576 --> 01:13:01.657]  If you believe in the mission we've had, please help us financially.
[01:13:01.777 --> 01:13:02.958]  Please help us spread the word.
[01:13:03.278 --> 01:13:11.461]  Please go out there physically, as Rick is doing, and speak truth to power, but also speak truth to passersby who are completely ignorant.
[01:13:11.981 --> 01:13:26.055]  And we really need to, in whatever ways we can, try to occupy the avenues that can help us grow into better areas and evacuate the systems that only contribute to our overall death and enslavement.
[01:13:26.495 --> 01:13:32.521]  And that's part of what we're trying to do here at InfoWars with the Money Bomb mission and with our ongoing mission throughout the years.
[01:13:33.001 --> 01:13:34.242]  You've seen the growth we've had.
[01:13:34.302 --> 01:13:35.042]  We can do more.
[01:13:35.102 --> 01:13:35.803]  Please help us.
[01:13:35.843 --> 01:13:37.744]  Thanks to everyone who has donated.
[01:13:38.384 --> 01:13:47.148]  If you haven't, please check out Infowarsmoneybomb.com and it's not too late to share that link with friends, family, strangers, and so forth.
[01:13:47.729 --> 01:13:51.751]  Rick, your closing comments and then we have Paul Joseph Watson coming up in just a few minutes.
[01:13:52.471 --> 01:13:53.392]  Other guests as well.
[01:13:53.412 --> 01:14:01.316]  Alex will be back in just a few hours and we have the exclusive video for Charlotte Isserby on Skull & Bones also coming up later.
[01:14:01.816 --> 01:14:03.097]  Rick Warden, your closing comments.
[01:14:03.998 --> 01:14:08.522]  First off, thank you very much Aaron, Rob, Alex Jones.
[01:14:09.483 --> 01:14:11.785]  I don't know where I would be without Alex Jones.
[01:14:12.186 --> 01:14:14.848]  I've been listening to Alex Jones for 15 years.
[01:14:14.868 --> 01:14:17.010]  I've been following Ron Paul for 15 years.
[01:14:17.751 --> 01:14:20.874]  And I want to say the last Money Bomb, what was it?
[01:14:20.954 --> 01:14:21.695]  Or the first one?
[01:14:22.055 --> 01:14:23.436]  This is only the second one.
[01:14:23.957 --> 01:14:26.139]  And so the first one was five years ago or something?
[01:14:27.523 --> 01:14:30.107]  Well, I think it was, uh, three years ago.
[01:14:30.127 --> 01:14:31.188]  It's real late at night.
[01:14:31.228 --> 01:14:31.569]  I don't know.
[01:14:33.891 --> 01:14:35.652]  Well, InfoWars really turned the corner.
[01:14:35.693 --> 01:14:44.740]  That was a great money bomb and just overall with all the special speakers, it just, I don't know, Alex's spirit just came alive and he's just been wonderful ever since.
[01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:47.983]  So, thank you everybody contributing to this money bomb.
[01:14:48.263 --> 01:14:52.206]  Thank you to my friends who have called me and said, yeah, I donated to Alex today.
[01:14:52.306 --> 01:14:54.148]  So, y'all are all awesome.
[01:14:54.808 --> 01:14:56.069]  Alex needs your support.
[01:14:56.129 --> 01:14:57.450]  He is by far the
[01:14:58.431 --> 01:14:59.592]  We're good to go.
[01:15:16.138 --> 01:15:22.564]  I want to encourage your listeners, please everybody go over to the Facebook page which is Occupy the Fed Dallas.
[01:15:23.325 --> 01:15:27.448]  What is nearest and truest to my heart right now is empowering you.
[01:15:27.909 --> 01:15:32.593]  You have a cell phone, a smartphone, it has a video camera on it.
[01:15:33.033 --> 01:15:34.353]  You can make a video.
[01:15:34.594 --> 01:15:36.394]  It has to be under two minutes or so.
[01:15:36.834 --> 01:15:39.355]  Load that video directly to YouTube.
[01:15:39.735 --> 01:15:41.275]  So you can go anywhere you want.
[01:15:41.315 --> 01:15:46.997]  You can go to the Federal Reserve Bank tomorrow and just make a video out there just speaking your mind.
[01:15:47.477 --> 01:15:49.098]  You don't have to have anyone with you.
[01:15:49.498 --> 01:15:54.439]  Or you can go on Saturday when there's 500 people there and make your own video.
[01:15:54.599 --> 01:15:56.640]  Become a news reporter.
[01:15:57.240 --> 01:16:02.842]  If you're so compelled to that's what I'm finding is that a lot of people are telling me how do you do what you do?
[01:16:03.302 --> 01:16:17.927]  The truth is I have what five six hundred videos online right now the majority of them five hundred of them were shot on my cell phone and so it's that simple folks to go to the Facebook page that is
[01:16:17.927 --> 01:16:18.548]  Thank you.
[01:16:35.795 --> 01:16:43.119]  Well thanks Rick, and of course you make a good point that the technology they've built to enslave us in some cases is poisonous.
[01:16:43.439 --> 01:16:48.121]  We know cell phones have contributed to tumors and also affect fertility and so forth.
[01:16:48.421 --> 01:16:52.383]  We can also use those exact kind of tools, the Facebook tools that are meant to track us.
[01:16:53.204 --> 01:16:57.666]  We can use those against the system as well to get the word out while those platforms are there.
[01:16:58.346 --> 01:17:04.051]  I know in just a minute we're going to go to another video and then coming up after that is Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:17:04.412 --> 01:17:07.654]  But really, this is an information warfare.
[01:17:08.315 --> 01:17:11.998]  This is information war in a time of information revolution.
[01:17:12.038 --> 01:17:13.199]  I can't stress that enough.
[01:17:13.279 --> 01:17:14.440]  Please look at history.
[01:17:14.781 --> 01:17:18.104]  Look at how we've never had this kind of access to information before.
[01:17:18.644 --> 01:17:20.466]  What are we going to do with that information?
[01:17:20.506 --> 01:17:23.248]  The power we have now, what direction are we going to take it?
[01:17:23.569 --> 01:17:25.490]  That's really what this fight is all about.
[01:17:25.891 --> 01:17:43.886]  We here at InfoWars have made our decision and we just want you to help us build that platform and send that metaphoric rocket out into space and spread that information as far and wide as we can to try to take hold, to try to occupy that available information stratosphere.
[01:17:44.867 --> 01:17:51.302]  Bit by bit and try to take back some liberty for all the tyranny that they've tried to advance.
[01:17:51.382 --> 01:17:53.086]  Do we have that video ready now guys?
[01:17:56.025 --> 01:17:58.166]  I'm told we do have that video so we're gonna go now.
[01:17:58.226 --> 01:18:00.146]  It's been an honor to sit in on the Money Bomb.
[01:18:00.166 --> 01:18:06.268]  We thank you everyone who's donated financially or to spread their word or even just stayed up to watch us.
[01:18:06.328 --> 01:18:14.071]  I know so many people just from watching the Money Bomb knowing that it's kind of a milestone event have gotten the spark to take action themselves.
[01:18:14.091 --> 01:18:15.411]  Some of our staff have told me
[01:18:16.111 --> 01:18:27.735]  They began to take action and now they work here and incidentally after watching the money bomb Maybe not even thinking they were part of the fight other people I've talked to as well Watching that later taking action themselves.
[01:18:27.775 --> 01:18:29.315]  Don't forget this moment in time.
[01:18:29.735 --> 01:18:34.877]  It's so important and critical in history It's been an honor to speak to you here on this platform.
[01:18:34.937 --> 01:18:40.499]  Please help us spread the word and archive this broadcast Everything you know what's going on.
[01:18:40.999 --> 01:18:42.259]  So let other people know too.
[01:18:42.619 --> 01:18:44.120]  Let's go to that video now stay tuned
[01:18:53.530 --> 01:19:00.516]  Well then, Tim, you guys have been doing a lot of managing around here, and I've decided to change our policies here at InfoWars.
[01:19:01.838 --> 01:19:07.763]  From now on, we are not going to allow any of the crew to bring their own lunches.
[01:19:08.363 --> 01:19:14.509]  Everyone will now buy their lunch in the break room cafeteria.
[01:19:15.390 --> 01:19:18.513]  And we will decide, I will decide what people eat now.
[01:19:19.683 --> 01:19:26.187]  For a long time, I thought that liberty and freedom was good, but now I realize that liberty and freedom is the freedom to not think.
[01:19:27.007 --> 01:19:33.431]  And I notice the Chicago School District has announced at many of their schools that parents are not allowed to pack the school lunches for their children.
[01:19:34.397 --> 01:19:37.958]  I noticed Mayor Bloomberg in New York wants to ban French fries and salt and things.
[01:19:37.978 --> 01:19:40.919]  They're talking about huge fines if people don't.
[01:19:40.979 --> 01:19:41.739]  And I think that's great.
[01:19:41.759 --> 01:19:48.540]  I hope Texas passes a law where I can have staff around here arrested if I see any French fries or if you bring your own food.
[01:19:48.661 --> 01:19:50.121]  In fact, we are owned by the state.
[01:19:50.161 --> 01:19:51.901]  That's what Land of the Free, Home of the Brave is all about.
[01:19:52.461 --> 01:19:55.822]  And I'm going to pick a food program to follow the government's idea.
[01:19:56.202 --> 01:19:59.923]  Only corn syrup, aspartame, MSG, and fluoride water.
[01:20:00.403 --> 01:20:00.683]  Okay?
[01:20:01.344 --> 01:20:02.344]  Will, you got any comments on that?
[01:20:04.775 --> 01:20:06.916]  So no food from home, huh?
[01:20:07.317 --> 01:20:10.359]  Straight from here, buy it from the work lounge, huh?
[01:20:10.719 --> 01:20:13.661]  Are you gonna provide us with details of the food safe for us?
[01:20:13.861 --> 01:20:17.343]  Listen, questioning is not what you do in America.
[01:20:18.284 --> 01:20:19.104]  Are you an extremist?
[01:20:20.765 --> 01:20:21.365]  Watch it, buddy.
[01:20:22.866 --> 01:20:23.267]  Watch it!
[01:20:24.708 --> 01:20:27.329]  Talk like that's what lets Al Qaeda hit us and hit us hard, okay?
[01:20:27.349 --> 01:20:32.112]  By the way, we're gonna overcharge about three times what the food's worth.
[01:20:32.512 --> 01:20:32.993]  You understand?
[01:20:34.656 --> 01:20:35.857]  Let me get the price list up.
[01:20:37.258 --> 01:20:38.839]  We're hitting with the new America!
[01:20:39.139 --> 01:20:40.400]  I was wrong all these years!
[01:20:42.221 --> 01:20:46.644]  I want you to go ahead and order a biometric scanner like they got at most of these lunch counters in public schools.
[01:20:47.404 --> 01:20:50.206]  People are going to biometrically scan to make sure you're buying your lunch here.
[01:20:50.326 --> 01:20:51.907]  Because that's also part of the job.
[01:20:52.728 --> 01:21:01.914]  And because terrorists could strike at any time, especially in this facility, I want to buy one of those body scanners and I want to start having a security guard stick their hand down everybody's pants that comes to work here.
[01:21:02.334 --> 01:21:03.235]  That's going to make it safer.
[01:21:05.031 --> 01:21:07.092]  Are you thinking bad things about that?
[01:21:07.332 --> 01:21:14.296]  No, no, I'm just, I'm just wondering, you know, it might just take more time away from getting work done, you know, if we gotta go through scanners every morning or something like that.
[01:21:14.316 --> 01:21:15.597]  Weldon, I want you to be safe.
[01:21:16.037 --> 01:21:18.078]  You can't be trusted bringing your own food to work.
[01:21:18.718 --> 01:21:22.360]  Man, I can't believe I'm just trying to be a patriot and trying to make sure you're safe and you're acting like that.
[01:21:23.081 --> 01:21:24.341]  What about you, Tim?
[01:21:24.361 --> 01:21:25.882]  I mean, are you with Weldon?
[01:21:26.342 --> 01:21:27.083]  Are you an extremist?
[01:21:28.328 --> 01:21:29.609]  No, I'll go along with it.
[01:21:30.229 --> 01:21:33.951]  I think it... I think I can understand where you're coming from, I guess.
[01:21:34.591 --> 01:21:35.751]  I think it's kind of extremist.
[01:21:35.991 --> 01:21:38.573]  I mean, you know, kind of delusional in a way.
[01:21:38.593 --> 01:21:40.333]  I mean, we gotta protect everybody.
[01:21:40.353 --> 01:21:43.755]  I mean, they come to work, they expect to work and be protected while they're at work.
[01:21:45.076 --> 01:21:47.216]  Just thought it might, uh, but yeah.
[01:21:47.857 --> 01:21:49.157]  Wait a minute, you just looked me in the eyes.
[01:21:49.177 --> 01:21:53.819]  The TSA manual says if you look a federal commander in the eyes, that's a sign of aggression.
[01:21:53.839 --> 01:21:57.001]  Quilton, just admit that you have got a sickness.
[01:21:58.749 --> 01:22:01.672]  You're a sickness that you would want to be able to bring your own lunch.
[01:22:02.373 --> 01:22:04.435]  Or be able to pack it for your own children for school.
[01:22:04.755 --> 01:22:05.275]  What type?
[01:22:05.656 --> 01:22:06.997]  What is wrong with you, man?
[01:22:07.257 --> 01:22:08.679]  Does a prisoner get to choose what they eat?
[01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:11.041]  See there, Weldon?
[01:22:12.182 --> 01:22:14.945]  Weldon, you've got to learn 2 plus 2 doesn't necessarily equal 4.
[01:22:14.985 --> 01:22:16.006]  It equals whatever I say.
[01:22:16.206 --> 01:22:17.828]  Now, are you supporting the new freedom?
[01:22:19.259 --> 01:22:20.119]  I'm with it, I understand.
[01:22:20.439 --> 01:22:24.943]  Just, uh, we'll get the word around and, uh, just need to feel safe, you know?
[01:22:25.283 --> 01:22:27.225]  I'm really glad that you came to your senses.
[01:22:27.505 --> 01:22:28.686]  Uh, now, whose crackers are these?
[01:22:29.807 --> 01:22:33.290]  Uh, they were mine, uh... You got five minutes to get them out of the building.
[01:22:33.310 --> 01:22:34.551]  I don't ever want to see this again.
[01:22:34.571 --> 01:22:35.772]  Get them out of here!
[01:22:39.793 --> 01:22:42.614]  And hey, don't think I'm trying to intimidate you right now and get in your face.
[01:22:42.914 --> 01:22:48.935]  When they groped that little six-year-old girl, I mean, kept her safe at that airport, the parents reportedly, the TSA, bowed up and got in their face.
[01:22:49.815 --> 01:22:50.375]  That's freedom!
[01:22:51.636 --> 01:22:53.436]  I'm just following what the federal government does.
[01:22:53.636 --> 01:22:58.477]  You're bowing up on parents because they don't like their kid being groped is what our government does, is what I do.
[01:22:59.357 --> 01:23:00.017]  Got a problem?
[01:23:00.237 --> 01:23:01.938]  There's gonna be a problem!
[01:23:01.958 --> 01:23:02.278]  No problem.
[01:23:02.678 --> 01:23:03.258]  That's freedom!
[01:23:04.098 --> 01:23:04.478]  Freedom!
[01:23:04.738 --> 01:23:06.399]  Oh, God, I got power now!
[01:23:15.647 --> 01:23:16.348]  Good, that's freedom!
[01:23:16.368 --> 01:23:16.708]  That's freedom!
[01:23:16.728 --> 01:23:17.168]  Good news, y'all.
[01:23:17.188 --> 01:23:17.628]  Check this out.
[01:23:17.688 --> 01:23:18.349]  Uh, from now on...
[01:23:37.912 --> 01:23:39.533]  You don't have to bring any food to work anymore.
[01:23:39.773 --> 01:23:41.614]  You don't have to think about what you're going to eat for lunch.
[01:23:42.674 --> 01:23:44.055]  We're going to have an employee meal plan.
[01:23:45.295 --> 01:23:47.456]  You're only allowed to buy lunch from the company break room.
[01:23:49.077 --> 01:23:50.998]  Straight from the top.
[01:23:51.398 --> 01:23:52.458]  Outside, food and drink.
[01:23:53.779 --> 01:23:54.819]  From now on, prohibited.
[01:23:57.140 --> 01:24:03.283]  Even more exciting news is we've got bottled water available with sodium fluoride for your safety.
[01:24:04.218 --> 01:24:06.160]  So, don't have to think anymore about what to bring, so.
[01:24:06.180 --> 01:24:08.643]  From now on, no more outside food.
[01:24:09.463 --> 01:24:09.964]  Or water.
[01:24:10.124 --> 01:24:11.025]  We got it all here, so.
[01:24:11.566 --> 01:24:12.687]  But I'm on a budget.
[01:24:13.768 --> 01:24:14.409]  Um, it's alright.
[01:24:14.429 --> 01:24:15.009]  Don't worry about it.
[01:24:15.850 --> 01:24:16.911]  You're still gonna have to pay for it.
[01:24:17.071 --> 01:24:17.832]  But it's, you know.
[01:24:18.413 --> 01:24:19.654]  We can take it out of your paycheck.
[01:24:21.456 --> 01:24:23.598]  Um... What's that?
[01:24:24.038 --> 01:24:25.119]  My mom makes my lunch.
[01:24:26.894 --> 01:24:30.336]  Well, that's old-fashioned, and that's not what the state approves of anymore.
[01:24:30.596 --> 01:24:32.638]  So, we're going to do what the state tells us to do.
[01:24:34.259 --> 01:24:36.640]  So, I've got these for you.
[01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:38.781]  Can I just finish this?
[01:24:38.942 --> 01:24:39.222]  No.
[01:24:40.703 --> 01:24:42.404]  Well, you've got like five minutes, basically.
[01:24:42.584 --> 01:24:46.306]  So, I don't know, either, you know, whatever you've got to do.
[01:24:46.506 --> 01:24:48.267]  You've got five minutes, and then it's in effect.
[01:24:48.287 --> 01:24:49.408]  So, here.
[01:24:49.588 --> 01:24:50.629]  Thanks for looking out for me.
[01:24:51.129 --> 01:24:51.810]  Here, take two.
[01:24:53.351 --> 01:24:55.092]  And I'll leave one more in here you guys can post it.
[01:24:58.280 --> 01:25:00.181]  So, uh, welcome to the new world order.
[01:25:00.201 --> 01:25:07.463]  This sucks, guys.
[01:25:07.744 --> 01:25:10.485]  I'm a vegetarian.
[01:25:10.525 --> 01:25:11.405]  It's okay.
[01:25:11.445 --> 01:25:18.568]  They want us to eat safer food.
[01:25:23.629 --> 01:25:24.630]  Well, well, well!
[01:25:24.650 --> 01:25:25.810]  Living in the air and dike!
[01:25:26.330 --> 01:25:27.011]  How you doing, buddy?
[01:25:27.091 --> 01:25:27.291]  Howdy.
[01:25:28.260 --> 01:25:29.002]  What are you doing right now?
[01:25:30.404 --> 01:25:32.128]  Just eating lunch while I'm going over some stories.
[01:25:32.308 --> 01:25:33.230]  Excuse me.
[01:25:34.878 --> 01:25:36.039]  What are you doing in the truck?
[01:25:36.819 --> 01:25:39.681]  Listen, buddy, that's what they do at the Chicago Public School System.
[01:25:40.001 --> 01:25:44.024]  This is like some kind of boss hog town where I gotta buy my food from the state store.
[01:25:44.864 --> 01:25:45.645]  Whoa!
[01:25:46.465 --> 01:25:47.506]  You are an extremist.
[01:25:47.526 --> 01:25:49.507]  You know, they have new mental illness designations.
[01:25:49.827 --> 01:25:53.469]  When you challenge authority in any way, it's a sign that you're dangerous.
[01:25:53.489 --> 01:25:56.411]  Maybe I should send the FBI or Homeland Security over here.
[01:25:57.252 --> 01:25:58.292]  I don't think so.
[01:25:58.453 --> 01:26:03.536]  You're gonna buy your food from this office because I know it's safe and I care about you and I have the moral high ground.
[01:26:04.176 --> 01:26:04.837]  Don't argue with me.
[01:26:06.698 --> 01:26:08.459]  And by the way, this system's going in nationwide.
[01:26:08.719 --> 01:26:10.740]  Don't think you'll just quit this job and get away from this.
[01:26:11.261 --> 01:26:13.882]  Don't think you'll just stop at public schools in Chicago or New York.
[01:26:14.603 --> 01:26:15.103]  You understand?
[01:26:15.123 --> 01:26:16.004]  Those are organic.
[01:26:17.625 --> 01:26:18.145]  Organic?
[01:26:20.286 --> 01:26:21.367]  What's this about Voss Hogg?
[01:26:21.387 --> 01:26:22.107]  What are you talking about?
[01:26:22.187 --> 01:26:24.149]  Oh, like, this is a sharecropper operation?
[01:26:24.169 --> 01:26:25.630]  You gotta buy your stuff from the company store?
[01:26:26.090 --> 01:26:29.252]  I'll be honest with you, that's exactly what this is, and they're all submitting to it.
[01:26:29.792 --> 01:26:30.413]  And I like it!
[01:26:31.417 --> 01:26:32.278]  You think you're a thinker?
[01:26:32.738 --> 01:26:34.379]  Get up and get your ass out of this office.
[01:26:34.399 --> 01:26:36.501]  You're fired, and I'm calling Homeland Security on you.
[01:26:36.521 --> 01:26:37.121]  Get out of here!
[01:26:40.644 --> 01:26:43.946]  You're a dying breed, we're running you out of this country, and we're taking over the whole planet.
[01:26:44.126 --> 01:26:44.947]  You understand me?
[01:26:44.967 --> 01:26:48.770]  The future belongs to the slave masters!
[01:26:49.911 --> 01:26:50.511]  You're fired!
[01:26:50.531 --> 01:26:54.915]  Oh God, it's gonna be so much fun when they arrest him.
[01:27:15.954 --> 01:27:17.254]  Hey, production crew!
[01:27:18.075 --> 01:27:18.235]  Hey!
[01:27:19.215 --> 01:27:21.736]  Uh, you guys gonna buy me lunch out of the back today?
[01:27:21.756 --> 01:27:23.316]  I brought my lunch.
[01:27:23.416 --> 01:27:23.936]  Yeah, me too.
[01:27:24.296 --> 01:27:26.737]  You saw the memo that went out at 9 a.m.
[01:27:26.977 --> 01:27:27.237]  Memo?
[01:27:27.257 --> 01:27:27.717]  What memo?
[01:27:28.598 --> 01:27:30.298]  Well, I didn't have time to get anything else, though.
[01:27:30.358 --> 01:27:30.938]  It's what we brought.
[01:27:30.978 --> 01:27:33.659]  No, dude, I've got... You saw all the food we've got there for you to buy?
[01:27:33.679 --> 01:27:35.320]  That's totally reasonable!
[01:27:35.340 --> 01:27:35.480]  Look!
[01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:39.781]  Are you saying the Chicago school system's wrong, not letting parents pack their lunches?
[01:27:41.641 --> 01:27:43.162]  Are you saying Mayor Bloomberg's wrong, Phil?
[01:27:44.065 --> 01:27:44.465]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:44.525 --> 01:27:45.446]  It doesn't seem right.
[01:27:45.646 --> 01:27:46.166]  It doesn't seem right.
[01:27:46.186 --> 01:27:46.906]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:27:46.926 --> 01:27:47.446]  Here's the deal.
[01:27:48.147 --> 01:27:48.507]  Okay?
[01:27:51.188 --> 01:27:51.968]  It's on me today.
[01:27:52.008 --> 01:27:53.109]  I'll buy your first lunch.
[01:27:53.549 --> 01:27:54.409]  And I'm doing you a favor.
[01:27:54.689 --> 01:27:55.710]  But that stuff's going in the trash.
[01:27:55.790 --> 01:27:56.210]  Okay, buddy?
[01:27:56.670 --> 01:27:57.230]  Wait, what are you doing?
[01:27:57.590 --> 01:27:58.691]  I'm gonna throw it in the trash, man.
[01:27:59.071 --> 01:28:01.192]  Listen, you saw the policy.
[01:28:02.272 --> 01:28:04.093]  But I... Look.
[01:28:04.513 --> 01:28:05.494]  That's an entire salad.
[01:28:05.614 --> 01:28:08.775]  I can't 100% know this is healthy and good for you, okay?
[01:28:10.475 --> 01:28:12.036]  Aaron Bloomberg's a very respected man.
[01:28:12.636 --> 01:28:14.197]  He also wants everybody to turn their firearms in.
[01:28:15.277 --> 01:28:16.038]  There you go, pal.
[01:28:16.458 --> 01:28:18.879]  Have you heard about how they've got giant fines for salt?
[01:28:19.399 --> 01:28:23.141]  In fact, I bet that there's salt on this chicken!
[01:28:24.942 --> 01:28:26.463]  They're trying to pass laws like this in Austin.
[01:28:26.483 --> 01:28:27.303]  That could shut us down.
[01:28:27.323 --> 01:28:28.484]  We're getting with the times.
[01:28:28.544 --> 01:28:28.944]  We're trendy.
[01:28:28.964 --> 01:28:29.704]  Do you understand that?
[01:28:31.105 --> 01:28:32.366]  You know, it's totally reasonable, Phil.
[01:28:32.686 --> 01:28:33.826]  It's for your own good, man.
[01:28:33.986 --> 01:28:34.927]  Yeah, thank you.
[01:28:35.407 --> 01:28:36.248]  Thank you, Jared.
[01:28:36.328 --> 01:28:36.828]  Not mine.
[01:28:38.729 --> 01:28:39.069]  Here we go.
[01:28:40.103 --> 01:28:42.624]  Now, like I said, I'm gonna be honest there.
[01:28:42.644 --> 01:28:44.965]  Everybody else has got to buy theirs, I'm gonna buy lunch for you, okay?
[01:28:45.606 --> 01:28:45.926]  Get up!
[01:28:45.946 --> 01:28:46.446]  Let's go!
[01:28:46.606 --> 01:28:47.407]  I've got you lunch!
[01:28:47.887 --> 01:28:49.008]  You know you'll appreciate it!
[01:28:56.031 --> 01:28:58.692]  God, what won't that Chicago Mafia think of next?
[01:28:58.732 --> 01:28:59.333]  This is gonna be ri-
[01:29:00.356 --> 01:29:01.136]  Oh, hi guys!
[01:29:01.176 --> 01:29:02.457]  I care about your health!
[01:29:02.557 --> 01:29:04.457]  Come on in, Matt and Tim.
[01:29:04.477 --> 01:29:06.258]  You guys liking the new policy?
[01:29:07.118 --> 01:29:09.999]  It's only $20 for this salad.
[01:29:10.679 --> 01:29:14.220]  Or I've got some fluoridated baby water here, only $3 a bottle.
[01:29:14.841 --> 01:29:23.603]  You can have ramen noodle, bananas, Lunchables, we've got some Spam, and we've also got some Vienna sausages.
[01:29:24.083 --> 01:29:25.084]  So what would you like here?
[01:29:26.124 --> 01:29:27.084]  Well, I brought my own banana.
[01:29:27.104 --> 01:29:28.385]  Is that okay?
[01:29:29.722 --> 01:29:30.162]  No, sir.
[01:29:30.743 --> 01:29:33.264]  We can't trust you to bring your own food, okay?
[01:29:33.764 --> 01:29:36.445]  Is there anything other than the fluoridated water?
[01:29:36.745 --> 01:29:38.306]  Sir, fluoride, for instance, your teeth.
[01:29:38.586 --> 01:29:44.489]  Don't be like the extremist kids that protested and they were called revolutionary extremists in Chicago and are probably now on the FBI list.
[01:29:44.549 --> 01:29:44.949]  Okay, buddy?
[01:29:44.969 --> 01:29:45.790]  Okay.
[01:29:45.810 --> 01:29:46.530]  This is reasonable.
[01:29:46.590 --> 01:29:49.191]  Not being able to decide what you're going to eat is freedom, okay?
[01:29:49.211 --> 01:29:50.132]  The government cares about you.
[01:29:50.152 --> 01:29:51.472]  Michelle Obama cares.
[01:29:51.512 --> 01:29:51.732]  Look.
[01:29:52.553 --> 01:29:52.853]  Look here.
[01:29:55.342 --> 01:29:55.842]  Take the carrots.
[01:29:56.283 --> 01:29:57.624]  Now listen, pay up, pal.
[01:29:57.704 --> 01:29:58.364]  I love liberty.
[01:29:58.824 --> 01:30:00.386]  Man, I forgot I left my wallet in the car.
[01:30:00.826 --> 01:30:02.067]  That's okay, that's okay.
[01:30:02.227 --> 01:30:03.888]  We're putting in a biometric scanner next week.
[01:30:03.928 --> 01:30:05.229]  Just mark it down in there on the board.
[01:30:05.689 --> 01:30:08.091]  And pretty soon we're just gonna deduct it from your check anyway so you don't have a choice.
[01:30:08.511 --> 01:30:10.112]  I'll grab a salad.
[01:30:10.152 --> 01:30:10.973]  Good, good.
[01:30:11.313 --> 01:30:12.674]  See, you had a choice here.
[01:30:12.814 --> 01:30:13.815]  Okay, uh, come on.
[01:30:35.532 --> 01:30:36.893]  Good job.
[01:30:36.953 --> 01:30:38.215]  You caught him with a Perrier.
[01:30:38.655 --> 01:30:39.716]  They get that in the trash.
[01:30:39.997 --> 01:30:41.979]  Roland, you've really turned it around since this morning.
[01:30:42.359 --> 01:30:43.321]  So your lunch is free.
[01:30:43.341 --> 01:30:43.881]  Thanks.
[01:30:43.921 --> 01:30:47.165]  That's how a fascist, communist, criminal, I mean, freedom system works.
[01:30:47.666 --> 01:30:48.867]  And take whatever else you like.
[01:30:48.887 --> 01:30:50.108]  Good job.
[01:30:50.229 --> 01:30:52.151]  And I want you to keep your eyes on Phil.
[01:30:52.751 --> 01:30:53.052]  Okay?
[01:30:53.092 --> 01:30:53.372]  We do.
[01:30:53.512 --> 01:30:53.733]  All right.
[01:30:53.753 --> 01:30:54.273]  Thank you very much.
[01:30:54.293 --> 01:30:54.554]  Good job.
[01:30:56.076 --> 01:30:58.200]  Alright, man, I'm really feeling powerful right now.
[01:30:58.240 --> 01:31:01.444]  I get to tell them what they eat, and, uh, I'm really enjoying this.
[01:31:01.544 --> 01:31:02.466]  Man, this is great, huh?
[01:31:16.476 --> 01:31:16.877]  Hey, Alex.
[01:31:16.977 --> 01:31:17.758]  Parents are slaves.
[01:31:18.098 --> 01:31:18.518]  Hey, Alex.
[01:31:18.538 --> 01:31:18.918]  Hey, Alex.
[01:31:18.959 --> 01:31:19.299]  Wake up.
[01:31:19.339 --> 01:31:20.420]  We got a show in five minutes.
[01:31:20.620 --> 01:31:20.880]  Huh?
[01:31:21.721 --> 01:31:22.141]  Oh, God.
[01:31:22.762 --> 01:31:24.443]  Oh, Jaren, I've never been so glad to see you.
[01:31:25.044 --> 01:31:29.687]  I woke up in a futuristic America where I was a police state control freak thug like Janet Napolitano.
[01:31:30.068 --> 01:31:31.128]  Well, it's all good now.
[01:31:31.189 --> 01:31:34.131]  Welcome to 2011 where we still have all our freedoms intact.
[01:31:34.151 --> 01:31:34.431]  Come on.
[01:31:34.451 --> 01:31:35.172]  We got a show to do.
[01:31:35.592 --> 01:31:36.293]  Man, that's great.
[01:31:42.828 --> 01:31:45.872]  Yeah, once those cameras came in from the studio backstage.
[01:31:46.093 --> 01:31:46.753]  Oh, awesome, man.
[01:31:47.074 --> 01:31:47.995]  Yeah, what's this?
[01:31:48.696 --> 01:31:49.056]  What's what?
[01:31:49.076 --> 01:31:49.617]  It's a salad.
[01:31:50.038 --> 01:31:55.365]  This morning you passed out a memo saying that we can't bring our own lunches in, but yet you're bringing stuff from Wendy's?
[01:31:55.785 --> 01:31:56.687]  You got a memo?
[01:31:58.349 --> 01:31:59.310]  There was a memo?
[01:32:03.667 --> 01:32:10.474]  When you're on the site, you can also tune in 24 hours a day to my daily radio broadcast.
[01:32:10.674 --> 01:32:14.498]  There's also a free iPhone app to listen to the syndicated radio show when and where you want.
[01:32:52.648 --> 01:32:55.731]  It's the InfoWars Moneybomb Live!
[01:32:55.831 --> 01:32:57.992]  InfoWarsMoneybomb.com.
[01:32:58.052 --> 01:33:03.497]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson, editor of PrisonPlanet.com, and I'll be your host for the next two hours.
[01:33:03.957 --> 01:33:13.024]  Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, it's just gone 9am here in the UK, and unlike the poor guys in the office, I've actually had a good night's sleep.
[01:33:14.005 --> 01:33:22.652]  So coming up, the lobby group you've never heard of caught, in its own words, admitting it controls the news.
[01:33:23.173 --> 01:33:28.337]  We've got former naval officer Brian Gerrish joining us to break that down and a whole lot more.
[01:33:29.298 --> 01:33:41.934]  Then in the next hour we're really going to hit a topic that's going to wake you up this morning and that is not one we normally tackle here on the Alex Jones Show and it's the always controversial issue of UFOs.
[01:33:42.014 --> 01:33:48.141]  UFO researcher Tony Topping joins us in the next hour so that's guaranteed to be interesting.
[01:33:48.982 --> 01:33:59.816]  But now I'm delighted to welcome someone who has been on the front lines of fighting the subversion of the British Isles into Airstrip 1 of the European Federal Superstate.
[01:34:00.477 --> 01:34:06.324]  And that, of course, is Brian Gerrish, former naval officer and of course now with the British Constitution Group.
[01:34:07.565 --> 01:34:19.195]  And also I might add the man who basically was the first to lift the lid on the sinister Common Purpose organisation which has infested its operatives into every level of British society.
[01:34:19.856 --> 01:34:22.918]  So we're going to cover a host of interesting topics today.
[01:34:23.018 --> 01:34:26.361]  Brian Gerrish, good morning and welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:34:26.902 --> 01:34:33.167]  Yeah, good morning Paul and thank you and Alex and all the rest of the crew for giving me an invite to speak.
[01:34:35.219 --> 01:34:37.120]  Well, you're welcome to be back on the show.
[01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:53.826]  First of all, obviously you've been a guest previously, but before we get into the whole Liam Fox issue and the cover-up surrounding that, just tell us about your background and how you first began to uncover groups like Common Purpose and what they were up to in the United Kingdom.
[01:34:54.941 --> 01:34:57.782]  Okay, well, it's, um, we'll keep it very short.
[01:34:58.182 --> 01:35:03.024]  I spent 21 years in the Navy as a warfare officer.
[01:35:03.704 --> 01:35:06.005]  I left in 1993.
[01:35:07.826 --> 01:35:14.848]  I got involved in a small business, started to become what I'll call a normal person.
[01:35:15.449 --> 01:35:20.490]  And then in my home city of Plymouth, which is down in the southwest of England,
[01:35:22.464 --> 01:35:29.149]  I started to discover massive fraud and corruption and much of it was to do with public money.
[01:35:29.169 --> 01:35:46.583]  So I started to dig into that more and strange things began to happen because essentially I started to be threatened and warned off and I wasn't too impressed with that because I'd always believed that my country was generally law-abiding.
[01:35:47.790 --> 01:35:56.982]  But then things came to a head when I tried to start a little project to help give unemployed young people some skills training and some hope for the future.
[01:35:57.002 --> 01:36:03.050]  And it was obvious that the local elite did not want this project to happen.
[01:36:03.923 --> 01:36:18.254]  And when I started to investigate why, not only did I get threatened more, including death threats, but I discovered a very sinister little organisation called Common Purpose at Work.
[01:36:18.935 --> 01:36:30.924]  And essentially, I'll say now with hindsight, because it's much easier now to look back and put the pieces together, the reason that I was treated in the way I was treated was because I
[01:36:33.214 --> 01:36:45.319]  I was trying to help create jobs, I was trying to get confidence back into local communities, when unknown to me at the time, the government policy was the exact opposite.
[01:36:45.359 --> 01:36:53.463]  It was to destroy jobs, it was to break down communities and it was to reduce young people to unemployed druggies.
[01:36:54.660 --> 01:36:56.642]  So that was the start of it.
[01:36:57.182 --> 01:37:12.354]  When I then began to really research into the subject, and I began to get very good people helping me, we discovered that this organisation, Common Purpose, which calls itself a charity, but what it was really doing was
[01:37:13.149 --> 01:37:19.270]  With inserting a very, very dangerous political agenda into everywhere it could get.
[01:37:19.790 --> 01:37:27.832]  And Common Purpose was, and still is, it's in the political circles, it's in schools, it's in hospitals, it's in the military.
[01:37:29.413 --> 01:37:35.234]  And their so-called graduate leaders are pushing forward
[01:37:35.914 --> 01:37:40.616]  The overall political agenda which is causing such problem.
[01:37:40.636 --> 01:37:45.117]  Now when you were setting up the show, somebody mentioned communism.
[01:37:45.137 --> 01:37:47.558]  We're not fighting communism.
[01:37:47.618 --> 01:37:52.439]  We're fighting something much, much more dangerous.
[01:37:52.619 --> 01:37:55.260]  It's Gramsci is the man we should be looking at.
[01:37:55.580 --> 01:38:01.162]  We should be looking at Saul Alinsky and we should be looking at Gramsci because this is
[01:38:02.618 --> 01:38:15.994]  This is Marxism, which is being imposed on America and Britain, and it's being done slowly, gently, piece by piece, in a very hidden, subversive way.
[01:38:16.675 --> 01:38:21.501]  But that is, in my view, is the ideology which Common Purpose is pushing.
[01:38:23.359 --> 01:38:35.208]  Now a lot of these issues can be found at Brian's website and they actually publish a newspaper which I encourage people to subscribe to and it's ukcolumn.org.
[01:38:35.688 --> 01:38:44.154]  Now for our American audience who perhaps aren't aware of this and if you're not then you need to be because it's very much a transatlantic controversy.
[01:38:45.215 --> 01:38:55.299]  And it takes on even more prominence given the news yesterday that Britain is basically now on a war footing to support the planned US and or Israeli strike on Iran.
[01:38:56.439 --> 01:39:06.903]  And this was a major story last month in the United Kingdom and it was of course the resignation of British Defence Secretary Liam Fox which came as a result of his relationship with
[01:39:06.903 --> 01:39:12.247]  with the lobbyist and all-around globalist insider Adam Werrity.
[01:39:12.927 --> 01:39:34.161]  And of course, Werrity, it turns out, was the frontman for this Atlantic Bridge Group, which in itself was funded by the Israeli lobby Baikon, with Werrity actually attending government meetings side-by-side with the British Defence Secretary on behalf of this pro-Israeli neocon faction.
[01:39:34.201 --> 01:39:36.483]  Of course, it led to Fox having to resign.
[01:39:38.183 --> 01:39:55.010]  Brian, this Werrity Fox Atlantic Bridge BICOM issue, I mean the tentacles run deep, it was almost universally ignored by the British press who merely concentrated on the fact that Fox had broke some ministerial code.
[01:39:55.070 --> 01:39:58.031]  They weren't interested about everything else that was going on behind the scenes.
[01:39:59.131 --> 01:40:00.953]  We'll certainly get into some of that later.
[01:40:01.333 --> 01:40:08.359]  But just how deep does this scandal with Liam Fox, Werritty and all these shadowy lobbyist groups run?
[01:40:09.220 --> 01:40:12.043]  Well the answer to that is it runs very deep.
[01:40:12.323 --> 01:40:16.767]  I'll just pick up on your point of what the British media did at the time.
[01:40:16.787 --> 01:40:25.655]  It was very interesting to watch what happened because most of the British media just simply focused on Liam Fox
[01:40:26.579 --> 01:40:40.005]  Liam Fox's relationship with Werethy as his best man and the fact that they dressed in a similar style and they clearly stayed with each other on a regular basis.
[01:40:40.025 --> 01:40:53.112]  So many of the press articles focused on the fact that there seemed to be a rather interesting and some would say unnatural relationship between Liam Fox and his best man.
[01:40:53.912 --> 01:40:57.474]  But one or two papers started to dig a bit deeper.
[01:40:58.014 --> 01:41:04.258]  But when they produced articles, the articles contained information, but it was very confusing.
[01:41:04.498 --> 01:41:08.100]  It was very hard to piece together what they were actually talking about.
[01:41:08.120 --> 01:41:14.423]  And I can say that we and a large number of other people have done a lot of research on this.
[01:41:15.183 --> 01:41:20.206]  And if I may, I'll just take listeners through some of the things that we now know.
[01:41:21.552 --> 01:41:26.999]  So, if we set the scene, we've got British Secretary of State for Defence, Liam Fox.
[01:41:27.940 --> 01:41:40.915]  He chooses his best man as a personal advisor, and his best man actually makes out that he's a bona fide government advisor, and he then accompanies
[01:41:41.747 --> 01:41:42.207]  We're good.
[01:42:04.457 --> 01:42:04.717]  I think?
[01:42:26.717 --> 01:42:32.882]  Most Americans will simply not understand how big the cuts have been on British military.
[01:42:33.543 --> 01:42:41.910]  So when our Prime Minister David Cameron is talking about wars against Iran, it's not going to be a major effort by the British.
[01:42:42.170 --> 01:42:48.215]  It's going to be American lives that are lost fighting Cameron's war mongering.
[01:42:48.995 --> 01:43:02.438]  But if I just bring you back to Mr. Werritty, Paul has already mentioned Atlantic Bridge, which was a so-called charity to help drive and improve relations between Britain and America.
[01:43:03.639 --> 01:43:11.120]  But that charity was actually closed down by the formal body in the UK because it was highly political.
[01:43:11.981 --> 01:43:17.862]  And under the charity rules in the United Kingdom, you can't be political if you're a charity.
[01:43:18.817 --> 01:43:31.586]  So, the Atlantic Bridge Organization was fraudulent itself, and when you look behind, we find, for example, people like John Falk, who's a U.S.
[01:43:31.606 --> 01:43:41.933]  defense lobbyist, linked in with an organization called Kestrel in the USA, which is ultimately linked through to Blackwater or Zeke.
[01:43:42.788 --> 01:43:53.392]  So, we're not seeing just an innocent best man who happened to set up a charity to help relations with Britain and America.
[01:43:53.852 --> 01:44:00.574]  We're seeing a man who's intimately connected in with what I regard as international nursery organisations.
[01:44:01.738 --> 01:44:26.137]  One of the papers that added a bit more was the Independent on Sunday, because they ran an article which was actually front page, and it said that Werritty, and let's remember he is the man right alongside the then Secretary of State for Defence in Britain, Mr Fox, their headline said that Werritty plotted with Mossad to target Iran.
[01:44:27.156 --> 01:44:42.864]  So what was happening at the time the Leanne Fox scandal came to the surface was that it was clear that in the background work was going on in order to help start some form of conflict with Iran.
[01:44:43.965 --> 01:44:53.370]  And it was very interesting that another British paper, the Daily Mail, ran some paragraphs in which it said that many officials
[01:44:54.497 --> 01:44:54.957]  We're good to go.
[01:45:22.623 --> 01:45:30.447]  So it was really quite interesting that if you did look right the way across the media, you could find a lot of information.
[01:45:31.247 --> 01:45:32.568]  But it was all in bits.
[01:45:34.769 --> 01:45:37.730]  There were other names that came forward in this scandal.
[01:45:37.790 --> 01:45:41.572]  One of them was Matthew Gould, the UK ambassador to Israel.
[01:45:41.592 --> 01:45:49.696]  He's an interesting character because he was originally the private parliamentary secretary to David Miliband.
[01:45:50.576 --> 01:45:57.703]  Of course, we've now got one of the Miliband brothers, Ed Miliband, who's leading the Labour Party in Britain.
[01:45:58.364 --> 01:46:04.129]  If we delve into his background, he comes from an absolutely dedicated Marxist family.
[01:46:04.910 --> 01:46:08.072]  So there's another little interesting bit.
[01:46:08.293 --> 01:46:11.776]  We find venture capitalists who donate £125,000 to the Conservative Party.
[01:46:15.782 --> 01:46:21.430]  But the real meat of it is in relation to an organisation called ParGav.
[01:46:22.592 --> 01:46:28.261]  And this effectively was a logging group that Adam Werritty had set up.
[01:46:29.432 --> 01:46:39.514]  And once we start to look at Pargav, we find effectively, well not effectively, because it's been reported in the press, but it's been hidden.
[01:46:39.674 --> 01:46:45.356]  We have a Finnish-Israeli arms dealer who's worth some £2 billion.
[01:46:46.116 --> 01:46:55.718]  We have him connected to Pargav, and we learn that he donated £15,000 for Cameron's leadership campaign.
[01:46:56.724 --> 01:46:58.525]  So here we have David Cameron.
[01:46:58.545 --> 01:47:00.807]  He appears out of nowhere.
[01:47:01.647 --> 01:47:04.029]  We call him a tough schoolboy from Eton.
[01:47:04.049 --> 01:47:16.717]  He suddenly appears as the British Prime Minister and now we're seeing that the type of people who are funded his leadership campaign are major international arms dealers.
[01:47:18.138 --> 01:47:22.301]  But he gets better than that because we've got
[01:47:23.948 --> 01:47:29.831]  We can start to actually see that there are other groups involved.
[01:47:30.532 --> 01:47:35.895]  So there's the Samiris Investment Group, which was paying money into Pargav as well.
[01:47:36.956 --> 01:47:45.961]  And that company owns, it is said, about 40% of the major property in Las Vegas casinos.
[01:47:46.061 --> 01:47:49.823]  It's got property in Washington, New York, Times Square.
[01:47:50.808 --> 01:48:04.714]  So the people who are clustered around Mr. Werathy, and therefore intimately linked with Mr. Fox, are certainly major and extremely wealthy people, including arms dealers.
[01:48:06.095 --> 01:48:17.320]  But we can get in a little bit deeper on this, because there was also a hedge fund called CQF involved.
[01:48:18.488 --> 01:48:24.512]  Um, this was also linked through a man called Oliver Hilton into Pargav.
[01:48:25.593 --> 01:48:32.137]  And CQS invested some 21 and a half million pounds in a high-tech firm called L3.
[01:48:34.218 --> 01:48:45.885]  And when Mr. Fox scrapped Britain's Nimrods, uh, these are equivalent to the, um, the American maritime patrol aircraft, such as the then P3.
[01:48:45.985 --> 01:48:47.206]  They're the same age.
[01:48:48.451 --> 01:48:54.415]  Um, but the moment those aircraft were scrapped, they cut the wings off and they destroyed all the simulators.
[01:48:55.215 --> 01:49:00.758]  But by an amazing coincidence, they were then replaced by three Boeing RC-135 aircraft, uh, worth, uh, 650 million.
[01:49:00.778 --> 01:49:03.200]  And those aircraft came from L3.
[01:49:10.174 --> 01:49:27.160]  So you can see that there was wheeling and dealing going on with absolutely massive UK defence contracts that were being done through the back door by Mr Werretty and his organisation Pargav and Pargav Limited.
[01:49:27.980 --> 01:49:35.863]  So the major press, which has convinced people in Britain that it's a little bit of maybe slap and tickle between Mr
[01:49:37.558 --> 01:49:39.780]  Fox and his best man.
[01:49:40.321 --> 01:49:47.127]  This is a smoke screen because what has gone on in the background is absolutely massive arms deals.
[01:49:47.707 --> 01:49:55.614]  But of course, it's also exposed that David Cameron has been levered into power by international arms dealers.
[01:49:57.931 --> 01:50:03.175]  I mean, as you said, this just opened up a can of worms that never ends.
[01:50:03.955 --> 01:50:10.519]  There was another group which was connected to this scandal, which I mentioned at the start.
[01:50:10.659 --> 01:50:20.105]  You had Werrity, of course, with Atlantic Bridge, but Atlantic Bridge, one of its main funders is this Israeli BICOM lobbyist group.
[01:50:21.386 --> 01:50:36.036]  No, from what I can see, no mainstream establishment newspaper has done a story on this astounding revelation which came out in a leaked email which was mistakenly sent by Bycom's CEO, this Israeli lobby group, to the press.
[01:50:36.736 --> 01:50:38.518]  And in this email, Brian,
[01:50:39.378 --> 01:50:55.994]  They brazenly boast about how they've penetrated BBC News and Sky News as a means of, quote, ensuring the most objectively favourable line was taken, end quote, in relation to a pro-Israeli stance in the news.
[01:50:57.916 --> 01:50:59.737]  Here's another quote in this leaked email.
[01:51:00.617 --> 01:51:15.164]  After contact with BiCom media team Sky News changed their narrative in explaining the prior events in the region which led up to this weekend and they're talking about the siege on the Israeli embassy back in September.
[01:51:15.684 --> 01:51:22.347]  So this group that funds Werrity's Atlantic Bridge in their own emails brag about how
[01:51:23.027 --> 01:51:27.771]  I mean, there's another one where they talk about they have a meeting with the BBC News editor.
[01:51:28.471 --> 01:51:35.857]  There's another quote where they say, quote, I briefed Jonathan Ford, the Financial Times lead writer, for his upcoming article.
[01:51:36.438 --> 01:51:37.358]  I briefed him.
[01:51:37.398 --> 01:51:39.760]  It's not that they gave him a quote or an interview.
[01:51:40.100 --> 01:51:41.782]  This lobby group is briefing
[01:51:42.322 --> 01:51:51.334]  Our journalists, BBC Sky News Financial Times, on what to report, and they brag about how they made them change their narrative about certain events.
[01:51:51.794 --> 01:51:58.623]  And this is the group linked to Werrity's Atlantic Bridge, so... I mean, Brian, we've caught them red-handed.
[01:51:58.663 --> 01:51:59.584]  This is how...
[01:52:00.425 --> 01:52:02.846]  Talking points in the media are generated.
[01:52:02.866 --> 01:52:05.306]  It's about how they dictate reality to us.
[01:52:05.647 --> 01:52:15.609]  So, I mean, what does this say about the so-called impartiality of the likes of the BBC and Sky News that they're being briefed by pro-Israeli lobby groups?
[01:52:16.210 --> 01:52:18.590]  Well, this is absolutely correct.
[01:52:18.950 --> 01:52:24.752]  I'd just like to say at this point, because I think it is an important thing to talk about.
[01:52:24.792 --> 01:52:27.913]  We're here talking about Israeli interest.
[01:52:30.134 --> 01:52:38.037]  The principal interest for us is what our own ministers are doing intermixing with these people.
[01:52:38.758 --> 01:52:53.404]  I can at the moment just sort of put a put a wall down and say the Israeli separate country whatever they want to do they can get on and do it we may not agree with all of it but at the moment in Britain we are focusing on what
[01:52:53.404 --> 01:52:59.526]  What our own politicians are doing, being bought or directed by these people.
[01:53:00.487 --> 01:53:14.972]  When I voted, when I have voted in national elections, I don't ever remember voting on a basis that I wanted people who were actually working for Israel coming into my country.
[01:53:15.852 --> 01:53:30.816]  Now, the key man in this, Mr. Zabludowicz, was the man who was intimately linked with the British Israel Communications and Research Centre, and he donated some £800,000 to them.
[01:53:31.396 --> 01:53:35.637]  So we're not talking about small institutions who are short of a bit of money.
[01:53:36.197 --> 01:53:42.319]  We're talking about people who are directing sums of billions of pounds or billions of dollars.
[01:53:43.060 --> 01:53:50.013]  And they are capable of buying whole organisations and government, never mind a few individual people.
[01:53:53.251 --> 01:54:00.112]  If you dig into BICOM, you very quickly find Mr Fox's smiling face at their events.
[01:54:01.072 --> 01:54:21.016]  And the other important thing to realise is that this activity is not related to one party, it's not related to the British Conservative Party, because we've got individuals like Hazel Blear's MP for the Labour side, who's also intimately involved with them.
[01:54:22.456 --> 01:54:32.381]  In fact, I can also say that Michael Gove, who's now our Education Secretary, is another man who is happy to come under the boycon fold.
[01:54:33.121 --> 01:54:42.705]  So I think that what we're really starting to ask is, is who are these people who are now in our Parliament and who are they working for?
[01:54:43.425 --> 01:54:47.307]  And the UK column, we did it as a very measured article, but we
[01:54:48.107 --> 01:54:56.712]  We ran an article which pointed out that David Cameron said that he would never break his allegiance to Israel.
[01:54:56.972 --> 01:54:59.333]  That was above everything.
[01:54:59.553 --> 01:55:14.602]  And so we said to him, can you explain to us, Mr. Cameron, how you can be the Prime Minister of Britain, which should be your alternate responsibility, and in fact what you're saying is that your primary responsibility is to Israel.
[01:55:15.402 --> 01:55:17.143]  I believe that what we are seeing
[01:55:18.123 --> 01:55:23.464]  Well, I'm sure what we're seeing in the British Parliament at the moment is utter treason.
[01:55:24.585 --> 01:55:32.607]  And we need to expose these people for what they really are, which is the spawn of international arms dealers.
[01:55:33.287 --> 01:55:36.868]  And of course, what do international arms dealers like?
[01:55:37.768 --> 01:55:43.069]  And it's very simple, they like wars and bloodshed because that's how they make their profit.
[01:55:43.909 --> 01:55:46.210]  So, to now see this
[01:55:48.191 --> 01:55:50.432]  I can't really describe him in the right way.
[01:55:50.512 --> 01:55:59.676]  This horrible man, Cameron, calling on America to start yet another war to start millions of deaths.
[01:56:00.437 --> 01:56:14.144]  I hope that the average American citizen out there, and certainly the people listening to this show, start to think to themselves, we don't need American deaths in order to satisfy Mr. Cameron's personal ambitions.
[01:56:16.744 --> 01:56:25.208]  It's amazing, and I mean, you talk about, you know, we don't vote for people to be influenced by Israeli lobbyists.
[01:56:25.248 --> 01:56:27.049]  It doesn't matter what country they come from.
[01:56:27.549 --> 01:56:32.651]  Russian lobbyists, any kind of outside influence whatsoever, it's a violation of sovereignty.
[01:56:33.211 --> 01:56:38.794]  It's the complete opposite of representational democracy, and it's got no business being in our country.
[01:56:39.194 --> 01:56:42.896]  I mean, this Lorna Fitzsimmons of this BICOM group, she
[01:56:43.576 --> 01:56:44.396]  She bragged it.
[01:56:44.837 --> 01:56:46.497]  I mean these quotes just keep coming.
[01:56:46.737 --> 01:56:50.379]  Quote, public opinion does not influence foreign policy in Britain.
[01:56:51.059 --> 01:56:53.420]  Foreign policy is an elite issue.
[01:56:53.640 --> 01:56:56.381]  So that again goes to the core of what you're saying with these people.
[01:56:56.841 --> 01:57:02.664]  Outsiders coming in and directing our foreign policy at odds to what the British people actually want.
[01:57:03.544 --> 01:57:04.425]  Yep.
[01:57:04.785 --> 01:57:12.850]  Switching gears, Brian, though, and I want to get on to the child abuse issue in a moment, but we had this big story a couple of months ago.
[01:57:12.890 --> 01:57:25.519]  What do you think about YouTube pulling down the video of the protest at Birkenhead where members of your group attempted to arrest the judge due to a, quote, government removal request?
[01:57:25.619 --> 01:57:28.121]  That's what YouTube said, and they pulled the video.
[01:57:29.304 --> 01:57:50.248]  Well, just to set the scene for listeners, a few months ago in a totally peaceful demonstration, 600 people on the streets up in the Midlands in the UK, basically a judge was arrested for running an unlawful court.
[01:57:50.948 --> 01:57:54.889]  Now of course the police did what we would expect of the police, which
[01:57:56.104 --> 01:57:57.025]  We're good to go.
[01:58:19.928 --> 01:58:23.711]  This is highly significant and I personally believe it.
[01:58:23.871 --> 01:58:24.932]  It's wonderful.
[01:58:25.112 --> 01:58:25.813]  It's excellent.
[01:58:26.373 --> 01:58:39.664]  Because what it has shown, and people understand the meaning, is the government is terrified of what people can do when they've got proper knowledge and understanding of what's happening in their country.
[01:58:40.284 --> 01:58:48.791]  So the British government was so terrified of what 600 peaceful protesters did in Birkenhead, near Liverpool,
[01:58:49.751 --> 01:58:51.832]  That they had to remove the video.
[01:58:51.852 --> 01:59:09.441]  Of course, on the day itself, despite 600 people being on the streets, about 40 police vehicles, I don't know how many hundred police with dog handlers and some riot police in the background.
[01:59:10.842 --> 01:59:17.525]  On the day, there was not a single report in any of the British mainstream media
[01:59:18.237 --> 01:59:23.683]  The BBC didn't cover it, none of the ITV, the independent channels covered it.
[01:59:24.224 --> 01:59:29.930]  There was simply one local radio station that published what had happened.
[01:59:29.950 --> 01:59:35.957]  Now this was obviously a media clampdown.
[01:59:38.308 --> 01:59:40.470]  And why would you need a media clampdown?
[01:59:40.530 --> 01:59:54.259]  Because the government is terrified of the truth coming out about the corruption in British courts and the fact that ordinary people are now starting to move to sort the problem out themselves.
[01:59:54.319 --> 01:59:55.320]  So that's what it's about.
[01:59:57.563 --> 02:00:02.506]  As he said, I mean, it just represents to me how much of a blind panic they're in.
[02:00:02.907 --> 02:00:05.828]  That they have to remove this video from the internet.
[02:00:06.189 --> 02:00:11.092]  And their excuse is, oh, you can't show footage of a, you know, a court in session.
[02:00:11.472 --> 02:00:16.495]  I mean, the court wasn't even in session and most of the video was of the protest outside.
[02:00:16.735 --> 02:00:18.997]  So again, that was just an excuse.
[02:00:19.517 --> 02:00:21.619]  And I mean, doesn't it show the fact that
[02:00:22.279 --> 02:00:32.041]  They're petrified of people understanding how, in this example, Roger Hayes, with the whole council tax issue, people can beat them at their own game.
[02:00:32.841 --> 02:00:45.084]  And I mean, that really goes to the heart of why they're so afraid, because if everyone else learns about how people are being successful in fighting it, then it's rapidly going to get out of control from their perspective.
[02:00:45.744 --> 02:00:55.729]  I think, Paul, that I know the Alex Jones Show is pushing out a lot of good information to people about what is actually happening, and we are trying to do the same.
[02:00:56.369 --> 02:01:00.631]  But I think something very, very interesting has happened in the last six months.
[02:01:01.692 --> 02:01:13.758]  You can now feel, you can see, if you're looking in the right place, that we are starting, we, this is all the people, thousands, millions of people who are starting to wake up,
[02:01:14.605 --> 02:01:34.914]  We are now starting to drive our own government because they also know people waking up and that is why we're suddenly seeing the rush through of all this very hard-hitting, draconian legislation to clamp down on American people and to clamp down on British people.
[02:01:35.614 --> 02:01:43.138]  They are now going flat out to introduce the dictatorships in Britain and America
[02:01:43.998 --> 02:01:50.783]  And the reason they're having to rush is because of the rate we are now exposing what they're doing.
[02:01:51.483 --> 02:02:01.930]  And the beauty is, the more they do, and the faster they do it, the more obvious it is to people that something is very wrong.
[02:02:02.958 --> 02:02:15.827]  So I think we, as well as getting out the message of all the terrible things that are happening at the moment, we've also very much got to focus on the positive things and where we're having successes.
[02:02:16.701 --> 02:02:30.127]  And one of the things that we know in Britain is we can't get justice, we can't bring treasonous politicians to justice, because the courts are utterly corrupt.
[02:02:30.147 --> 02:02:44.614]  And one British MP called John Hemme, who came to an event we put on last weekend, sorry, the weekend before last, was happy to stand on stage and be filled
[02:02:45.334 --> 02:02:49.799]  Saying that the British courts and judiciary are corrupt.
[02:02:50.400 --> 02:03:01.131]  So we've got to deal with these corrupt courts and these corrupt judges if we are going to get democracy and proper law and order restored in our country.
[02:03:04.383 --> 02:03:14.752]  And that tipping point is going to be more likely the more the number of insiders like the MP you just mentioned come out and speak out against that.
[02:03:15.432 --> 02:03:21.897]  I mean readers of the UK column are well aware of switching gears for the next topic.
[02:03:21.917 --> 02:03:23.319]  The fact that you've covered this
[02:03:24.099 --> 02:03:27.462]  Serial state kidnapping of children for years now.
[02:03:27.882 --> 02:03:34.187]  And for our American audience, if you think the CPS is bad in the United States, then this certainly rivals it.
[02:03:34.648 --> 02:03:39.912]  We're talking about no court order, barely any legal process in many cases.
[02:03:40.572 --> 02:03:47.778]  Police, from the stories I read, literally hunting down cars in the middle of the night to snatch babies from parents.
[02:03:48.318 --> 02:03:51.401]  I mean, Brian, we've read the cases in the media about
[02:03:51.941 --> 02:03:57.623]  You know, taking so-called obese children from parents and the media will report on that at length.
[02:03:58.544 --> 02:04:13.370]  But what you've reported in the UK column is something that could only represent a deliberate assault on the family unit by the state with these kind of child kidnappings, child abduction and eventually child abuse.
[02:04:13.430 --> 02:04:18.152]  I mean, tell us why this is happening in the UK and why it's so prevalent.
[02:04:18.792 --> 02:04:19.673]  Well, um...
[02:04:20.513 --> 02:04:36.703]  You've made that very easy for me, because all we have to do is bring listeners back and get them focused on Saul Alinsky in particular, and also Gramsci, who was an Italian Marxist.
[02:04:37.284 --> 02:04:42.527]  You don't need to read huge books, you can go on the internet and just google both of them.
[02:04:43.343 --> 02:05:02.230]  And what you will find these men talking about is getting in to destroy traditional democracies, to destroy traditional communities, by getting in and destroying families, and particularly Christian families.
[02:05:03.170 --> 02:05:11.973]  And their tactics are instead of guns and bombs and bullets, you actually infiltrate
[02:05:12.657 --> 02:05:18.920]  into the establishment, the system itself, and then you do the damage from the inside.
[02:05:19.620 --> 02:05:41.430]  But the family, the family unit, the heterosexual family unit, was always their primary target, because if you can break up mothers and fathers, mums and dads, and you can take the children, then those children can be groomed straight into the new political ideology.
[02:05:42.478 --> 02:05:45.340]  And what we've got to do is put the scale of this.
[02:05:45.740 --> 02:06:00.090]  Remember that Britain is a much smaller country than America, but we're dealing with, at the moment, with over 60,000 children who actually have been taken away from their parents.
[02:06:00.110 --> 02:06:04.933]  The children are being taken inside courts
[02:06:05.760 --> 02:06:07.443]  Where there are no juries.
[02:06:08.104 --> 02:06:10.048]  Where the press is not allowed to be.
[02:06:10.068 --> 02:06:13.173]  So these are secret courts.
[02:06:13.614 --> 02:06:16.399]  Star Chamber is the correct word in Britain for them.
[02:06:16.439 --> 02:06:17.621]  They are secret courts.
[02:06:18.721 --> 02:06:22.524]  The evidence brought in is falsified.
[02:06:22.544 --> 02:06:29.170]  Psychiatrist reports, psychologist reports contain lies, false information.
[02:06:29.750 --> 02:06:31.412]  They are factually incorrect.
[02:06:32.052 --> 02:06:37.317]  And it doesn't matter what the parents do inside the court, their children are taken from them.
[02:06:38.314 --> 02:06:48.660]  And again, we know that the government in the UK is beginning to get very fearful of the speed at which the information is coming out.
[02:06:49.300 --> 02:06:58.025]  Because in the last two days, a gentleman called David Norgrove has published his report on family justice.
[02:06:58.946 --> 02:07:02.308]  And he's actually saying that the whole process should be speeded up.
[02:07:03.390 --> 02:07:12.037]  In particular, he's saying that if a couple breaks up, the father should not have automatic access to his own children.
[02:07:13.198 --> 02:07:29.069]  And he's also saying, this man, that grandparents who actually get involved when couples break up and say, we can look after the children, that those grandparents are actually doing damage to the children and they should be cut out.
[02:07:29.930 --> 02:07:32.892]  Now, David Cameron, let's stay focused on David Cameron.
[02:07:32.892 --> 02:07:35.853]  David Cameron, because this man is so dangerous.
[02:07:36.614 --> 02:07:45.898]  David Cameron, the Prime Minister of Britain, is backing a report which says that fathers should be denied access to their children.
[02:07:45.919 --> 02:07:54.483]  This is the work of Gramsci, and of course David Cameron is not a Conservative in any shape or form.
[02:07:55.143 --> 02:07:56.484]  He is a subversive.
[02:07:57.264 --> 02:08:00.446]  I personally regard him as a domestic extremist.
[02:08:01.046 --> 02:08:06.550]  And what he is doing is implanting Gramscian ideology.
[02:08:07.090 --> 02:08:21.718]  So this is why we're having such an amazing attack on families, and thousands and thousands of children are being taken away, because if we can break down the family, then the state can claim the children.
[02:08:22.138 --> 02:08:23.099]  It's as simple as that.
[02:08:25.077 --> 02:08:31.683]  I mean, this goes to the very heart of broken Britain, which is this phrase we hear constantly.
[02:08:32.204 --> 02:08:35.287]  Most people don't realise that it's been deliberately broken.
[02:08:35.327 --> 02:08:40.291]  If it's broken, then somebody's going to put it back together again, and you can bet that that's going to be the state.
[02:08:42.193 --> 02:08:48.557]  A shining example of what it leads to is what we witnessed in the UK back in August, which was the riots.
[02:08:48.917 --> 02:08:53.660]  Now I'm guessing, Brian, that came as completely expected to you.
[02:08:53.740 --> 02:08:57.682]  I mean, your newspaper's been predicting widespread social unrest.
[02:08:58.203 --> 02:09:00.724]  I predicted it in articles I wrote two years ago.
[02:09:01.184 --> 02:09:08.769]  So I'm guessing that the riots which started in London and spread across major cities back in August didn't come as a surprise to you.
[02:09:09.429 --> 02:09:10.930]  Oh, well, absolutely not.
[02:09:11.251 --> 02:09:18.497]  And it was very easy to see within a few hours, but certainly within 24 hours.
[02:09:20.559 --> 02:09:26.144]  These were not spontaneous riots from people who'd had enough.
[02:09:26.965 --> 02:09:29.307]  It just didn't stack up.
[02:09:29.327 --> 02:09:35.012]  We know how difficult it is to organize people across the country.
[02:09:35.653 --> 02:09:44.200]  And here we have the British government saying that riots were being organized in not only London, but other cities across the UK.
[02:09:44.540 --> 02:09:47.083]  That these riots were being organized by young
[02:09:47.723 --> 02:09:50.686]  Black teenagers using BlackBerry phones.
[02:09:50.706 --> 02:09:53.188]  This is absolute nonsense.
[02:09:53.228 --> 02:10:10.263]  What was actually happening was the violence was being created by government agitators and we also know from residents in some of the areas where the riots took place that they watched police deliberately held back
[02:10:11.073 --> 02:10:17.421]  So that they didn't intervene and the thing then grew, the trouble on the streets grew.
[02:10:18.042 --> 02:10:23.790]  So somebody was ordering the police, let's stand back, let's allow this thing to grow, let's kick it off.
[02:10:24.856 --> 02:10:48.927]  And we've got better information than that because some British policemen, and these are brilliant people because they're so brave, they have actually been leaking information that when they were taken into an area where the rioting had started, they saw other so-called police units
[02:10:49.873 --> 02:10:51.534]  Who they didn't recognize.
[02:10:51.574 --> 02:10:54.515]  They had no idea what units these really were.
[02:10:54.555 --> 02:10:57.096]  They had no idea where the people had come from.
[02:10:57.116 --> 02:11:06.239]  And in many cases, they were talking about so-called policemen who didn't have any formal number or name identity on them.
[02:11:07.190 --> 02:11:24.800]  So, we have British policemen who are themselves now starting to blow the whistle on the fact that when there is trouble on the streets, there are agitators who are being moved into position, you know, via our own policing system.
[02:11:25.726 --> 02:11:32.030]  So this is very, very dangerous because we have now got government-backed agitation.
[02:11:32.871 --> 02:11:36.994]  And if listeners are thinking, you know, where do they want to take this?
[02:11:37.614 --> 02:11:38.875]  I'll give my opinion.
[02:11:38.895 --> 02:11:41.937]  So this is just Brian Gerrish's opinion on this one.
[02:11:42.577 --> 02:11:47.461]  They want absolute major violence on the streets of Britain.
[02:11:48.181 --> 02:11:55.406]  Because if they can create that major violence, they will bring in the Civil Contingencies Act.
[02:11:56.126 --> 02:11:59.109]  Which is roughly equivalent to the American Patriot Act.
[02:11:59.690 --> 02:12:06.896]  The moment the Civil Contingencies Act is in place, we are living in a dictatorship.
[02:12:07.805 --> 02:12:17.875]  So, whenever we're giving talks as the UK Column or the British Constitution Group, we're constantly warning that we need people to be peaceful.
[02:12:18.616 --> 02:12:24.661]  We don't need fights between blacks and whites or Muslims or Christians, whatever the groups are.
[02:12:25.322 --> 02:12:30.127]  If we fight amongst ourselves, the criminals who are in power,
[02:12:31.162 --> 02:12:39.169]  In the Senate, in America, and Congress, and in Westminster in Britain, those criminals win.
[02:12:39.430 --> 02:12:42.552]  We've got to be smarter than violence at the moment.
[02:12:43.073 --> 02:12:51.140]  We've got to keep it calm and peaceful, and we've got to get the truth out about how our countries are being destroyed from the inside.
[02:12:53.357 --> 02:13:08.303]  I mean, just to bite you up, we actually did a story in regard to the riots where Twitter users were reporting that men claiming to represent the media were actually driving around the streets and paying them to riot.
[02:13:08.464 --> 02:13:10.444]  Paying them to break shop windows.
[02:13:10.985 --> 02:13:13.206]  As he said, paying them to become agitators.
[02:13:13.266 --> 02:13:15.987]  So, I mean, those riots obviously
[02:13:16.727 --> 02:13:28.453]  After it went on the social meme and it was on the news every night, you had copycats going out and doing the same thing, but the genesis of those riots, as you said, was definitely provocateur-ed in many ways.
[02:13:30.623 --> 02:13:46.460]  Extrapolating this out, just about the general state of Britain, Brian, perhaps the best way to frame that is to ask, what do groups like Common Purpose want to turn Britain into and how far have they got down that path?
[02:13:47.682 --> 02:13:54.952]  Well, very simply, Common Purpose wants to create a new society.
[02:13:56.153 --> 02:14:01.801]  It doesn't ever define the society properly because this is how the con works.
[02:14:03.163 --> 02:14:17.838]  If you said to people, join Common Purpose and we are working to overturn present society and we want to create a new society that's going to be governed by a political elite, most people would run away.
[02:14:17.858 --> 02:14:21.101]  So what Common Purpose is doing is being very
[02:14:21.361 --> 02:14:32.386]  It's sucking people into courses where it's giving them an education to impose this new ideology on them.
[02:14:33.206 --> 02:14:40.950]  And we know how it is being done, and I really would ask listeners to go away and research this for themselves.
[02:14:41.570 --> 02:14:47.553]  The way they are doing it is to use NLP, neuro-linguistic programming.
[02:14:48.334 --> 02:14:52.338]  This is a form, technically it's a form of hypnosis.
[02:14:53.479 --> 02:15:00.726]  But these are very, very, very sophisticated techniques of messing around with people's minds.
[02:15:01.727 --> 02:15:08.313]  And although NLP can be used to help people, it can be used in therapeutic ways.
[02:15:08.333 --> 02:15:12.598]  What we are seeing is NLP being used
[02:15:13.218 --> 02:15:23.181]  to promote a very dangerous political agenda and it's being used to change people's views and values without them actually being aware of it.
[02:15:24.101 --> 02:15:27.262]  Now, if you say to me, how bad has it got?
[02:15:28.082 --> 02:15:37.665]  I'm going to be able to say with total confidence, because the UK column has published this stuff in detail, we've now got common purpose
[02:15:38.645 --> 02:15:41.467]  embedded at the highest level of government.
[02:15:42.188 --> 02:15:51.714]  One of Cameron's ministers who's helping promote it is Oliver Letwin, who I'll say just happens to be an ex-MN Rothschild man.
[02:15:52.835 --> 02:15:56.478]  But we've got Common Purpose, which is a political charity.
[02:15:56.998 --> 02:15:57.439]  I know that.
[02:15:57.899 --> 02:16:02.422]  I've already said earlier that it's not possible to be political, but I'm sure you they are.
[02:16:03.323 --> 02:16:07.746]  They are now bedded straight into the government cabinet office.
[02:16:08.872 --> 02:16:19.418]  And they have been put under contract to help set up behavioural change units in every government department.
[02:16:20.178 --> 02:16:23.260]  Now this is not fantasy, this is fact.
[02:16:23.420 --> 02:16:27.702]  We've got the documents, we know the names, we know when the meetings took place.
[02:16:28.403 --> 02:16:34.306]  So in the UK at the moment, every key government department has a cell
[02:16:35.422 --> 02:16:43.044]  Which is tasked, first of all, with changing the views and values and behaviour of the government department people.
[02:16:43.964 --> 02:16:52.587]  And when they've achieved that, the departments are going to use the same effect on us to change our views and values in society.
[02:16:53.627 --> 02:16:54.387]  In society.
[02:16:54.487 --> 02:17:00.668]  Now, the government's own documents, and I'll quote one of them, which is called Mindspace.
[02:17:01.489 --> 02:17:03.689]  Mindspace, you can find it on Google.
[02:17:04.269 --> 02:17:15.992]  In that document, it actually admits that the psychological processes they're using, the NLP they're using, can change our views and values and beliefs.
[02:17:17.052 --> 02:17:22.073]  We may not even know that those things have been changed.
[02:17:22.777 --> 02:17:33.589]  These modern applied psychology tools are so powerful we can have our views changed we're not even aware the views changed.
[02:17:34.725 --> 02:17:41.287]  Alternatively, we might realize we've changed, we're doing different things, but we don't know how it was done to us.
[02:17:41.887 --> 02:17:45.548]  Now that's not Brian Gerrish telling the audience that.
[02:17:46.068 --> 02:17:48.869]  That has come straight out of government document.
[02:17:49.689 --> 02:17:51.469]  So let's start to put this together.
[02:17:51.969 --> 02:17:58.511]  We've got, in Britain, and the same thing's happening in America, we have international criminals
[02:17:59.304 --> 02:18:06.567]  Who have now wormed their way... We've been stupid enough to elect them, but they're now in positions of power in government.
[02:18:07.087 --> 02:18:08.627]  They're leaked to arms dealers.
[02:18:08.867 --> 02:18:11.268]  They're calling for wars throughout the world.
[02:18:12.029 --> 02:18:19.871]  And these people are prepared to use applied psychology on their own citizens in order to get their agenda through.
[02:18:19.891 --> 02:18:24.453]  This is very, very dangerous stuff, and we've got to take the lid off it.
[02:18:27.216 --> 02:18:33.041]  And I mean, NLP, which you were talking about before, goes right to the heart of what you just said.
[02:18:33.081 --> 02:18:34.963]  It's about manipulating behaviour.
[02:18:35.003 --> 02:18:38.586]  It's about certain phrases and emphasis on words.
[02:18:38.646 --> 02:18:42.309]  And this is used in advertising, it's used in speeches, it's used in politics.
[02:18:42.890 --> 02:18:43.871]  And it's about trying to...
[02:18:44.511 --> 02:18:46.452]  Get people to do what you want them to do.
[02:18:46.532 --> 02:18:50.455]  Get them to think what you want them to think by the words that you use.
[02:18:50.495 --> 02:18:58.580]  I mean, it's sold as a self-help tool, and I'm sure a lot of people do use it for that, but it's been hijacked, and it's now being used for nefarious ends.
[02:18:59.140 --> 02:19:10.808]  Just as a... Can I... Paul, can I... Sorry to cut you off, but if I may, because I'm watching the time, something I'd like to bring to the attention of the American audience is that in South Wales,
[02:19:12.067 --> 02:19:16.569]  South Wales being obviously part of the United Kingdom.
[02:19:17.609 --> 02:19:30.474]  Over the last two years, in a very small geographic area, we now have over 40 teenagers, very young teenagers and young people committing suicide.
[02:19:31.662 --> 02:19:34.603]  It's been going on for two years.
[02:19:34.623 --> 02:19:36.884]  The suicides are still continuing.
[02:19:37.844 --> 02:19:43.366]  And what is so terrible is these are children aged 15, 14, 15, 16, and up through to sort of young 20s.
[02:19:49.529 --> 02:19:53.910]  And the method of suicide is that they are all hanging themselves.
[02:19:54.310 --> 02:19:58.771]  Now, this is not a very nice topic, but we're in very dangerous times at the moment.
[02:19:59.491 --> 02:20:04.293]  When we look at the suicides, and we see they're all hanging themselves, this is unusual.
[02:20:04.973 --> 02:20:14.955]  Because the facts are, statistically, that boys normally hang themselves, or men hang themselves, whereas girls and women take drugs and maybe cut their wrists.
[02:20:16.015 --> 02:20:17.996]  But these people are all hanging themselves.
[02:20:18.897 --> 02:20:31.273]  Now, at the moment, the British government has put a media clampdown on these suicides because they do not want people in Britain to realise that something very, very nasty is happening with young people.
[02:20:32.694 --> 02:20:37.540]  But when we dig into what is actually happening in this area of South Wales,
[02:20:42.744 --> 02:21:06.915]  I can speak with confidence on this because we actually now have NLP trainers, people who are professional trainers in NLP, they have come forward to us
[02:21:07.759 --> 02:21:19.535]  to give us information because they are absolutely horrified that what they regard as a therapeutic skill is being unleashed on children in a political sense.
[02:21:20.669 --> 02:21:36.514]  Now, what one of these professional NLP people explained to me, and I think it's a very, very good analogy, if you buy yourself a new computer, and it's a very fast machine, and you're very pleased with it, this is like the human brain.
[02:21:36.674 --> 02:21:37.594]  It's working well.
[02:21:38.594 --> 02:21:46.557]  And then you add a program, and everything's fine, and you add a few more programs, and then you fancy a game, and you add a couple of computer games,
[02:21:47.575 --> 02:21:52.538]  And after you've added so many things into your computer, eventually you get the odd problem.
[02:21:52.778 --> 02:21:54.459]  It freezes or it stops.
[02:21:55.340 --> 02:22:07.087]  And if you really overload it with lots of little screensavers and games and programs, eventually you can have major problems with your computer until you get it cleaned out.
[02:22:08.108 --> 02:22:15.112]  Now what the NLP trainer explained to me is that if you start to put in NLP clips,
[02:22:15.988 --> 02:22:20.533]  NLP programs into the minds of children and young people.
[02:22:21.654 --> 02:22:26.239]  You do a bit in this lesson, a bit in that lesson, a bit in next year's lesson.
[02:22:26.940 --> 02:22:28.762]  Eventually you get problems.
[02:22:29.921 --> 02:22:41.209]  And his view, and I think he's absolutely correct, is that we are now starting to see the political pushing of applied behavioral psychology.
[02:22:41.729 --> 02:22:46.492]  This is now starting to result in our young people committing suicide.
[02:22:47.113 --> 02:22:53.457]  This is very dangerous stuff, and exactly the same processes are being used in American schools.
[02:22:56.897 --> 02:23:09.141]  And it's interesting you touch upon that subject because a couple of weeks ago I wrote an article about Demos, which of course is the think tank of which Cameron regularly gives speeches, so did Tony Blair.
[02:23:09.582 --> 02:23:15.984]  Founded by Marxists, Julian Middleton, who of course is majorly involved with Common Purpose, sits on their board.
[02:23:16.764 --> 02:23:24.806]  And there was a story recently about Demos sending their agents out to schools to basically train them how to judge sources.
[02:23:25.066 --> 02:23:34.408]  And of course, anything designated as a quote, conspiracy theory, anything that disagrees with the official orthodoxy was denigrated and rubbished.
[02:23:34.508 --> 02:23:42.890]  So they're actually sending out Demos people to train school children to dismiss anything that goes against the government line.
[02:23:43.350 --> 02:23:44.250]  And we actually had
[02:23:45.070 --> 02:23:51.413]  One of the Demos employees on the Alex Jones Nightly News after, and of course he denied everything.
[02:23:52.093 --> 02:23:55.774]  From my perspective it seemed like he was just working at the lower level.
[02:23:55.814 --> 02:23:58.976]  He's got no idea what the overall organisation is about.
[02:23:59.096 --> 02:24:04.138]  Although he did admit that Demos is funded by the British government.
[02:24:04.158 --> 02:24:12.361]  So of course that's going to have an influence on what they're allowed to do and what kind of programmes they're allowed to bring to schools and introduce to the curriculum.
[02:24:12.981 --> 02:24:13.882]  But one more thing.
[02:24:14.622 --> 02:24:16.885]  Brian, we've got a few minutes before we end here.
[02:24:17.766 --> 02:24:24.834]  It's interesting that we did an article on these Common Purpose promo videos which were on YouTube a couple of years ago.
[02:24:26.175 --> 02:24:28.838]  Really downright creepy stuff.
[02:24:29.619 --> 02:24:30.099]  We're good.
[02:24:50.016 --> 02:24:56.701]  I mean, Common Purpose had a thing on their website recently saying, you know, attacking you basically, saying what you say is all rubbish.
[02:24:56.741 --> 02:25:02.866]  But it's very interesting, when you point out these things, they seem to get very nervous and start to remove material.
[02:25:02.906 --> 02:25:05.367]  Is that the case from what you're experiencing?
[02:25:05.648 --> 02:25:07.329]  Yeah, that is absolutely correct.
[02:25:07.429 --> 02:25:09.971]  But let's look at this on a positive side.
[02:25:10.211 --> 02:25:15.635]  If these people have nothing to hide, they should be very proud of all their material up.
[02:25:16.515 --> 02:25:26.200]  The fact that when you lift the stone, you shine the spotlight on them, they start to backtrack instantly tells you they're up to no good.
[02:25:26.900 --> 02:25:36.605]  So I'm delighted when stuff gets taken down because what the government is doing for free is telling us that we're beginning to look in the right areas.
[02:25:37.145 --> 02:25:38.846]  We're beginning to look in the right direction.
[02:25:39.346 --> 02:25:45.429]  And just to come back to Demos very quickly, I'm really glad that you mentioned Demos is a
[02:25:45.749 --> 02:25:51.593]  It's a Marxist organisation, and it is right next to the British government.
[02:25:52.154 --> 02:25:57.257]  It's a policy creation think tank.
[02:25:57.918 --> 02:26:07.945]  It has advised Labour, it's advised the Liberal Democrats, and now it's interwoven into the so-called Conservative government.
[02:26:08.445 --> 02:26:12.348]  And yes, you're absolutely right, Julia Middleton linked to Demos.
[02:26:14.089 --> 02:26:28.535]  Everywhere we now turn, where the country, Britain and America is being ripped apart, it's being done because the Marxist ideology has been let loose inside the country.
[02:26:28.635 --> 02:26:41.261]  Well, we've got very, very brave American men and women serving their country in the American Armed Forces, and they think they're out there on the front line defending their country.
[02:26:41.901 --> 02:26:54.689]  What is actually going on is that the Marxists have put their people in power straight into Congress, straight into the Senate, and in Britain, straight into Westminster.
[02:26:55.269 --> 02:26:57.370]  We know who these people are.
[02:26:57.770 --> 02:26:59.752]  In Britain, we certainly know who they are.
[02:27:00.452 --> 02:27:03.354]  And all we've got to do is remove them.
[02:27:04.214 --> 02:27:05.115]  Is it possible?
[02:27:05.515 --> 02:27:08.457]  I'm going to say it's going to start to happen very quickly.
[02:27:09.077 --> 02:27:10.318]  And the beauty of it is
[02:27:10.970 --> 02:27:22.898]  But initially, I think things will get a little bit ugly, but the longer we keep it peaceful, the faster the truth comes out, and the quicker these people start running.
[02:27:23.078 --> 02:27:30.584]  You only had to see the fear on Liam Fox's face when he started to be exposed in the press.
[02:27:31.344 --> 02:27:46.194]  So if you want to know how to hurt these people, how to get rid of them, you've got to name them, you've got to get their photographs into the media, onto the internet, and we've got to name them for what they are.
[02:27:46.294 --> 02:27:58.242]  They are dangerous criminals, they're Marxists, many of them are child abusers, certainly in the British political circles, and we need to expose them for what they really are.
[02:27:58.482 --> 02:27:59.523]  If we do that,
[02:28:00.503 --> 02:28:03.064]  We can overcome what's happening.
[02:28:05.105 --> 02:28:13.729]  And just to conclude, Brian, give people the websites, tell them how they can get involved with the British Constitution Group, UK Column, etc.
[02:28:14.329 --> 02:28:14.690]  Okay.
[02:28:15.050 --> 02:28:27.055]  Well, the UK Column is a newspaper, is a voluntary newspaper, but we're reporting on what's happening in the country and we're analysing it, and that is simply www.uk.gov.uk.
[02:28:29.612 --> 02:28:31.153]  UK Column.
[02:28:32.093 --> 02:28:36.255]  That's C-O-L-U-M-N.
[02:28:37.355 --> 02:28:41.697]  www.ukcolumn.org, O-R-G.
[02:28:43.038 --> 02:28:55.903]  The British Constitution Group, which is showing how common law and constitution is being undermined, is www.thebcgroup.
[02:28:56.143 --> 02:28:57.163]  All one word.
[02:28:59.332 --> 02:29:19.032]  www.bcgroup.org.uk and if you go to either of those sites you'll start to see what we're about and if you're interested in Common Purpose I've another site which is called www.cpexposed.com
[02:29:24.141 --> 02:29:28.845]  That is going to get a big update fairly shortly but there's a lot of information on Common Purpose.
[02:29:29.505 --> 02:29:42.395]  And can I just lastly say that this coming Saturday the British Constitution Group has got a big talk in London in which we are going to be exposing the traitors in Westminster.
[02:29:43.135 --> 02:29:54.350]  And in the evening at half past five there are big demonstrations planned by Anonymous and Occupy London and these are
[02:29:56.068 --> 02:30:02.976]  People who have now decided to come out on the streets and protest against the criminals in Parliament.
[02:30:03.697 --> 02:30:13.309]  So I doubt if much of it will come out on mainstream press, but I hope Paul and Alex at the Alex Jones Show will cover some of that event.
[02:30:15.794 --> 02:30:22.437]  Okay, Brian Gerrish, we'll get this interview on YouTube, be seen by tens of thousands of people, we'll get the information out.
[02:30:23.317 --> 02:30:27.259]  Really appreciate you joining me this morning, and you've got my email address.
[02:30:27.299 --> 02:30:32.301]  As soon as you want to come on again, just shoot me an email, and we'll get you on again with Alex.
[02:30:32.401 --> 02:30:34.102]  Brian Gerrish, thank you very much.
[02:30:34.582 --> 02:30:34.922]  Thank you.
[02:30:36.701 --> 02:30:40.543]  Okay, there goes Brian Gerrish, UK colon dot org.
[02:30:41.563 --> 02:30:52.408]  We're going to go to a video now before we get our next guest on and this is of an event in London of which Brian Gerrish was a speaker concerning the state child abduction issue.
[02:30:53.609 --> 02:31:00.112]  I believe it was in Trafalgar Square so we're going to go to this interview for a few minutes then we're going to come back with our guest and we're going to
[02:31:01.465 --> 02:31:02.286]  Get a bit weird!
[02:31:02.506 --> 02:31:11.713]  It's going to be a topic that's rarely covered on the Alex Jones Show, but we're going to get Tony topping on UFO Researcher, going to cover a host of controversial subjects.
[02:31:12.253 --> 02:31:14.795]  So now we go to this Brian Gerrish clip.
[02:31:14.995 --> 02:31:15.656]  Stay tuned.
[02:31:15.736 --> 02:31:18.118]  InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[02:31:18.158 --> 02:31:19.319]  We'll be back in a few minutes.
[02:31:27.597 --> 02:31:49.893]  I couldn't believe it until families, mums, dads, partners began to bring documentation which showed overwhelmingly and without any doubt that what we were seeing happen in courts was that children were being taken away from their parents.
[02:31:51.594 --> 02:31:55.357]  And some of you will be thinking, well they must have done something wrong.
[02:31:56.522 --> 02:32:01.625]  They must have hurt their children or they must have been dangerous or they must have had mental illness.
[02:32:02.765 --> 02:32:05.847]  Well certainly for some families that's true.
[02:32:06.728 --> 02:32:16.293]  But what began to interest us is when we started to see that children were taken away from perfectly good, loving mums and dads.
[02:32:21.426 --> 02:32:36.431]  On false evidence, false accusations, false documentation, court documents with no official court stamp and no signature by a judge.
[02:32:36.911 --> 02:32:47.994]  We started to find out that the police were collaborating with the courts and social services in order to take children away from their parents.
[02:32:49.105 --> 02:32:55.707]  And if you ask me what's happening to the children when they're taken away from their parents, they're being abused.
[02:32:56.688 --> 02:33:01.649]  And if you don't know what that means, it can mean that just psychological abuse.
[02:33:02.509 --> 02:33:03.790]  They're given a rough time.
[02:33:03.890 --> 02:33:08.011]  And for some of them it means they're sexually abused.
[02:33:09.092 --> 02:33:15.934]  And I didn't believe this either until I started to listen to some of these mums and dads and I started to look at the evidence.
[02:33:17.265 --> 02:33:22.413]  And then we started to realise that some of these children disappear into the system.
[02:33:24.256 --> 02:33:26.459]  And you may wonder how they can disappear.
[02:33:26.479 --> 02:33:27.801]  So I've got a question.
[02:33:28.583 --> 02:33:30.786]  Is the BBC present today?
[02:33:34.789 --> 02:33:38.310]  Are any of the major newspapers present today?
[02:33:38.370 --> 02:33:39.851]  No.
[02:33:41.291 --> 02:33:44.912]  Do we have any of the mainstream media present?
[02:33:45.132 --> 02:33:47.113]  No.
[02:33:47.253 --> 02:33:58.356]  So we have a rally in central London where people are warning that the children are being taken and there is not one single representative of mainstream media.
[02:33:59.736 --> 02:34:02.837]  Can I ask if there are any Members of Parliament here?
[02:34:04.386 --> 02:34:07.351]  Is Mr John Hemming in the audience perhaps?
[02:34:08.473 --> 02:34:09.234]  Are there any MPs?
[02:34:11.139 --> 02:34:12.440]  Are there any counsellors?
[02:34:13.581 --> 02:34:22.590]  I've just been told that Mr John Heming gave his apology so I'll say he is a man who's starting to do some things.
[02:34:23.330 --> 02:34:36.862]  But the reason this is going on is because there is a massive media clampdown which says when we start to talk about what is happening to children and how they are being snatched by the state
[02:34:37.843 --> 02:34:41.425]  You cannot get a single article into the papers.
[02:34:42.085 --> 02:34:45.947]  There is not a single documentary on mainstream TV.
[02:34:46.768 --> 02:34:52.951]  And if you want to know what's happening in the courts, you have to go into the court with the parents.
[02:34:53.591 --> 02:34:56.633]  Because the courts are secret courts.
[02:34:57.995 --> 02:35:10.420]  Never mind what the law lords say, Judge Judge and Mr Mumby, if you look at what is happening in the family courts in Britain, they are secret courts.
[02:35:11.240 --> 02:35:24.266]  The public is not allowed in, there are no juries, and the press, if they are allowed in at all, are told by the judges what they can and cannot report.
[02:35:25.807 --> 02:35:29.349]  These are unlawful courts.
[02:35:29.869 --> 02:35:41.617]  They are unlawful at common law under the British Constitution and they are in fact administrative courts or statute law courts.
[02:35:42.377 --> 02:35:44.619]  And the fact there is a single judge
[02:35:46.013 --> 02:35:49.637]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:35:50.017 --> 02:35:53.041]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:35:53.281 --> 02:35:58.046]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:35:58.066 --> 02:36:04.313]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:36:04.473 --> 02:36:06.695]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:36:07.216 --> 02:36:07.516]  Tim Geithner?
[02:36:07.536 --> 02:36:07.976]  Bernanke?
[02:36:08.056 --> 02:36:08.697]  They're arsonists!
[02:36:08.717 --> 02:36:09.717]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:36:09.797 --> 02:36:12.238]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:36:26.144 --> 02:36:27.965]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:36:28.265 --> 02:36:33.047]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[02:36:33.407 --> 02:36:42.530]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:37:38.982 --> 02:37:46.986]  Welcome back, it's the InfoWars Moneybomb Marathon Live, now approaching half ten in the UK.
[02:37:47.006 --> 02:37:50.108]  The guys in the office, some of them have had some sleep, some haven't.
[02:37:50.708 --> 02:37:52.389]  Alex Jones is going to be back soon.
[02:37:54.130 --> 02:37:58.632]  InfoWarsMoneybomb.com, I see we're already at 215,000, so we've got several hours left.
[02:38:03.354 --> 02:38:09.960]  Remaining of this 24-hour broadcast and we're hoping to get up there somewhere close to the 500,000 mark.
[02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:16.726]  I know a lot of the money isn't counted until after it comes in, so it's really important that you support us.
[02:38:17.147 --> 02:38:26.575]  As I wrote in my article a few days ago, unlike media matters, unlike the big liberal leftist organizations, we don't get
[02:38:27.296 --> 02:38:36.123]  Half a million dollar, five hundred thousand dollar, five million dollar checks from the likes of George Soros were not funded by the Carnegie Institute.
[02:38:36.583 --> 02:38:44.009]  We don't force people to pay license fees for content they may not even want with government backing it up like the BBC.
[02:38:44.729 --> 02:38:46.771]  So that's why we need your support.
[02:38:46.811 --> 02:38:48.972]  You've seen what we've done over the last year or so.
[02:38:49.940 --> 02:38:55.102]  We've built the TV studio reaching, you know, conservatively double the amount of people.
[02:38:55.602 --> 02:39:00.264]  Infowars.com gets more traffic than MSNBC.com.
[02:39:00.824 --> 02:39:03.525]  And yet we don't take handouts from General Electric.
[02:39:03.865 --> 02:39:08.066]  So how have we managed to get more traffic than MSNBC.com?
[02:39:08.106 --> 02:39:10.707]  Well, because of your support in the last two money bombs.
[02:39:11.067 --> 02:39:13.368]  And that's why we need your support once again.
[02:39:13.828 --> 02:39:18.750]  Infowarsmoneybomb.com to take the info war to the next level.
[02:39:19.170 --> 02:39:23.832]  I can't emphasize how much we're taking on the establishment and winning.
[02:39:24.052 --> 02:39:32.435]  We get more traffic than a lot of big news websites, establishment media funded by giant transnational corporations.
[02:39:32.475 --> 02:39:36.517]  That's got to be judged as a measure of success and none of it
[02:39:37.017 --> 02:39:42.661]  None of it would be possible without your support, which we've generously had over the past several years.
[02:39:42.701 --> 02:39:53.189]  So please go to infowarsmoneybomb.com and support the Info War, which Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing and we're winning.
[02:39:53.609 --> 02:39:53.890]  Why?
[02:39:54.010 --> 02:39:55.331]  Because of your support.
[02:39:55.411 --> 02:39:57.412]  Infowarsmoneybomb.com
[02:39:58.573 --> 02:40:01.976]  Now, we're going to plunge headfirst into a controversial topic.
[02:40:02.857 --> 02:40:14.889]  It's often speculative and nebulous, which is why we don't cover it too much on the Alex Jones Show, what with all the other crises, scandals and cover-ups staring us in the face.
[02:40:15.770 --> 02:40:20.855]  But, you know, if it's good enough for the likes of the History Channel, then why shouldn't we talk about it?
[02:40:21.756 --> 02:40:26.698]  And that, of course, is the ever-controversial subject of UFOs and ufology.
[02:40:27.418 --> 02:40:41.183]  And to talk about this, we welcome UFO researcher Tony Topping, a man who's appeared on the likes of BBC, Sky News, Channel 4, and is, in fact, TalkSport's resident ufologist to discuss this fascinating subject.
[02:40:41.523 --> 02:40:44.024]  Tony, welcome to the Alex Jones Show this morning.
[02:40:44.384 --> 02:40:47.245]  Oh, well, welcome, Paul, and thank you very much indeed.
[02:40:47.285 --> 02:40:49.567]  Sincere thanks for having me come on air.
[02:40:50.207 --> 02:40:58.871]  There are lots of people who come on the Alex Jones Show discussing lots of subjects, and so I feel very humbled that you chose me to come on the show.
[02:41:00.152 --> 02:41:06.195]  This morning, before I came on air, and we'll go into all that, I was once again harassed this morning.
[02:41:07.135 --> 02:41:11.157]  And what we're doing at Brian Gerrish was talking about, I think, one level of a conspiracy,
[02:41:11.537 --> 02:41:25.181]  And I think we're gonna click it up for the listeners in the US and in the UK and talk about the conspiracy that is paranormal and where the two meet and the UFO stuff and all that I've been subjected to, etc, etc, Paul.
[02:41:26.261 --> 02:41:34.344]  Well, just start off, Tony, by telling the audience about yourself, how you got involved in all this and why you think it's important.
[02:41:35.407 --> 02:41:37.067]  Yeah, well, this is absolutely right.
[02:41:37.187 --> 02:41:47.390]  I was, since early childhood, since the age of two, I had my first paranormal experience where something walked through a wall.
[02:41:48.170 --> 02:41:54.232]  And I remember at the age of two being unable to decipher what I was seeing walking through that wall.
[02:41:54.532 --> 02:41:57.012]  And I was screaming at my father and pointing at the wall.
[02:41:57.032 --> 02:42:01.493]  And I still can see myself now doing this, even at two.
[02:42:01.573 --> 02:42:03.054]  I've got quite a visual memory.
[02:42:03.074 --> 02:42:04.294]  I can see this event happening.
[02:42:04.714 --> 02:42:07.275]  And my father going, oh, don't worry, there's nothing there.
[02:42:07.415 --> 02:42:10.016]  I remember the word now, there's nothing there, and he put me back in my cot.
[02:42:10.736 --> 02:42:31.463]  And since then, I had all kinds of paranormal experiences from the age of seven, eight, into my teenage years, I dabbled a bit into the occult, and it wasn't really until about 1991, before I went to drama school in London, that I had a UFO appear over the house, like something out of Close Encounters.
[02:42:31.983 --> 02:42:33.204]  It was there, it was gone,
[02:42:33.824 --> 02:42:37.687]  And I wondered why it was there, what its purpose was.
[02:42:37.747 --> 02:42:40.850]  I wondered for months about it as to what it was and did I really see it.
[02:42:41.250 --> 02:42:58.324]  And little would I know that these UFOs would start turning up and cause me to swallow a red pill the like of which nobody has ever seen before and would plunge me headlong into a situation that I really have taken some years to actually work out.
[02:42:58.364 --> 02:43:01.206]  It's taken some considerable time to suss out what has been going on.
[02:43:03.568 --> 02:43:05.430]  And so I went to stage school.
[02:43:06.170 --> 02:43:09.513]  Nothing really much happened at stage school until I left stage school.
[02:43:10.374 --> 02:43:12.316]  And I started working in London in an office.
[02:43:12.576 --> 02:43:15.478]  I'd gone to stage school in London and I started working in an office in London.
[02:43:15.839 --> 02:43:19.362]  And I started having my first UFO incident over Paddington in London.
[02:43:20.202 --> 02:43:24.626]  And then there was a string of successive flyovers of these objects.
[02:43:24.666 --> 02:43:26.368]  They kept appearing, they kept appearing.
[02:43:26.908 --> 02:43:27.949]  Later on little... I'd been
[02:43:28.029 --> 02:43:28.489]  We're good.
[02:43:48.606 --> 02:44:05.735]  Um, connected with all the extraordinary paranormal experiences I was having, uh, I had a UFO come in over the house, over the estate, and illuminate a TV antenna, and we took that for image analysis, and the guy who did the image analysis said that that indeed was a UFO.
[02:44:06.275 --> 02:44:16.580]  And somebody who works in, in Army Intelligence, who I used to work with, um, who commented to me, because I put a website up on the internet poll, which was frankly bollocks, uh, it was,
[02:44:17.381 --> 02:44:31.637]  1999 and I put this website up which talked about talked about me assuming to know what was going on when I didn't and as this guy said to me that will attract people out of the woodwork and sure enough boy oh boy Paul did they come out of the woodwork
[02:44:32.037 --> 02:44:40.340]  I started getting phone calls, I started being followed, and I started being subjected to horrendous mind-invasive technology.
[02:44:40.781 --> 02:44:42.221]  Absolutely horrendous.
[02:44:42.701 --> 02:44:44.642]  There is a tyranny out there.
[02:44:45.042 --> 02:44:46.123]  It is carefully hidden.
[02:44:46.603 --> 02:44:53.766]  It is now coming into plain view, and its engine is specifically driven to control, control, control.
[02:44:54.526 --> 02:45:00.751]  The situation at the moment, I think, I'm going slightly off pace here, is that the people in power have not got a clue.
[02:45:01.512 --> 02:45:05.195]  And I'm sure you would agree with me that they've not got a clue what is controlling them.
[02:45:05.756 --> 02:45:20.868]  And you see a lot of Illuminati symbolism in the pop music industry with the famous all-seeing eye and the horn symbol, that famous kind of occult, I think it's that occult saying, we approve of his presence on high, as in the coming of the Antichrist.
[02:45:21.369 --> 02:45:22.230]  And I discovered
[02:45:23.092 --> 02:45:27.294]  Because of all my UFO interactions and strange experiences that I had swallowed a red pill.
[02:45:27.694 --> 02:45:35.698]  And whether I liked it or not, I was truly seeing the world around me for what it really was, that humanity was being controlled.
[02:45:35.738 --> 02:45:40.840]  And so, I was followed in pubs, I had phone calls, I had an unmarked helicopter film me.
[02:45:41.580 --> 02:45:47.023]  We had to take that to James Defence Weekly, should I say I did, we took that to James Defence Weekly.
[02:45:48.264 --> 02:45:51.788]  They looked at it and they said that the helicopter that filmed you is an AS555.
[02:45:52.089 --> 02:45:57.956]  It's a special forces helicopter that is unique to the governments of the US and Canada.
[02:45:58.396 --> 02:46:02.361]  If you look in any other kit that the RAF have, the RAF don't.
[02:46:02.401 --> 02:46:02.901]  We're good to go.
[02:46:21.694 --> 02:46:27.518]  Um, and I couldn't quite piece together at that time in 1999 why they, why they were doing that.
[02:46:27.998 --> 02:46:32.621]  But I ended up, uh, being targeted by very mind-inversive technology.
[02:46:33.061 --> 02:46:34.262]  Nasty, nasty stuff.
[02:46:34.773 --> 02:46:38.275]  Followed into pubs by, we would call them, intelligence operatives.
[02:46:39.996 --> 02:46:49.483]  And you may think that this is an extremely kooky story made up to sell books, to sell my latest book, etc, etc, but it isn't.
[02:46:49.663 --> 02:46:52.645]  I had a responsible job, Paul, and I had to leave that because of it all.
[02:46:52.945 --> 02:47:01.330]  There was one morning I was actually attacked by this mind-invasive technology in about January 2001, and I actually thought that I was going to die.
[02:47:02.311 --> 02:47:04.252]  On many occasions I've sailed close to
[02:47:04.292 --> 02:47:04.332]  to
[02:47:22.757 --> 02:47:24.038]  I don't think so.
[02:47:41.935 --> 02:47:47.620]  In 1950, what perhaps the UFO phenomenon was all about, and it took me years to concur this.
[02:47:48.241 --> 02:47:51.544]  So that's the, kind of like, the background, Paul.
[02:47:51.585 --> 02:47:53.366]  Good grief, I've waffled on for nearly 11 minutes.
[02:47:53.386 --> 02:47:57.591]  That's kind of like the background to what was going on.
[02:47:57.751 --> 02:48:03.497]  I'm suffering post-traumatic stress disorder from all this, as is quite a few people who have been subjected to it.
[02:48:03.817 --> 02:48:05.278]  But it's the harassment, Paul.
[02:48:05.438 --> 02:48:08.119]  It's nasty, nasty, nasty.
[02:48:08.779 --> 02:48:10.640]  And there are very nasty people behind it.
[02:48:10.720 --> 02:48:13.821]  And I was told that they wanted this kept quiet.
[02:48:15.393 --> 02:48:21.058]  But Tony, I mean, what do you say in response to people who question, I mean, why would they harass you?
[02:48:21.159 --> 02:48:22.099]  Why follow you?
[02:48:22.460 --> 02:48:23.641]  Why you in particular?
[02:48:23.921 --> 02:48:25.823]  Well, they don't just harass me though, Paul.
[02:48:25.863 --> 02:48:27.605]  It's not me in particular that they harass.
[02:48:27.645 --> 02:48:33.450]  If you look at the bigger picture, you soon discover that other researchers were being harassed.
[02:48:33.530 --> 02:48:37.234]  There was a guy in New Zealand who keeps himself quiet now called Alec Newald.
[02:48:37.754 --> 02:48:39.435]  He wrote a book called Co-Evolution.
[02:48:39.835 --> 02:48:40.536]  He was harassed.
[02:48:40.576 --> 02:48:56.486]  He had people from the Royal Institute of International Affairs, which I'm sure you're familiar with, Paul, and the Australian Defence Research people turn up on his doorstep asking why his car, wanting to confiscate his car, because his car had been subjected to high electrical voltage.
[02:48:57.146 --> 02:49:01.569]  The story of Alec Newald is he was driving down the road in 1996, something like that,
[02:49:03.790 --> 02:49:05.211]  And he went missing for 10 days.
[02:49:05.931 --> 02:49:07.172]  And he didn't know where he was.
[02:49:07.673 --> 02:49:10.234]  As far as he was concerned, he thought he was in a car accident.
[02:49:10.394 --> 02:49:13.236]  He had two ghostly figures walking towards him.
[02:49:13.256 --> 02:49:16.238]  And he thought they were ghosts because he thought he was dead.
[02:49:16.298 --> 02:49:17.098]  But they weren't ghosts.
[02:49:17.198 --> 02:49:17.879]  They were aliens.
[02:49:17.939 --> 02:49:21.861]  They'd been dimensionally transferred into another environment.
[02:49:22.281 --> 02:49:26.864]  And so he got harassment and he got stitched up with a prison sentence.
[02:49:27.324 --> 02:49:29.486]  Another woman called Dr. Carla Turner
[02:49:30.026 --> 02:49:32.527]  Who I highly recommend in the United States.
[02:49:32.888 --> 02:49:35.309]  She was right on the money, I think, with what was happening.
[02:49:35.789 --> 02:49:37.230]  She's certainly been harassed.
[02:49:37.390 --> 02:49:41.012]  Dr. Stephen Greer has certainly been harassed.
[02:49:41.412 --> 02:49:51.258]  But it's when it gets mind-invasive, Paul, when they start the mind-invasive stuff, as reported by a lot of people, that's when it really does get particularly nasty.
[02:49:51.538 --> 02:49:55.460]  And you have all on trying to keep sane with it all, and all on trying to cope with it.
[02:49:55.760 --> 02:50:04.447]  There's a very real conspiracy, a very real one indeed, to which the material of Infowars and the conspiracy of UFOs do merge.
[02:50:04.467 --> 02:50:10.511]  Let's bring it back to that convergence which you mentioned at the start of the show.
[02:50:10.832 --> 02:50:16.836]  Back in August, the New York Times writer and economist Paul Krugman said the following on CNN.
[02:50:16.876 --> 02:50:17.477]  This is a quote.
[02:50:18.257 --> 02:50:33.163]  Quote, if we discovered that space aliens were planning to attack and we needed a massive build-up to counter the space alien threat and rallying budget deficits took secondary place to that, this slump, he's talking about the economic slump,
[02:50:33.283 --> 02:50:40.352]  Would be over in 18 months, and then if we discovered, oops, we made a mistake, there aren't any aliens, we'd be better.
[02:50:40.712 --> 02:50:48.803]  Now, we've heard the famous Reagan quote in a similar context, where he's speaking during the Cold War about, you know, this alien threat.
[02:50:48.863 --> 02:50:51.306]  If we had this alien threat, it would band us all together.
[02:50:52.347 --> 02:51:04.789]  To your mind, Tony, is this notion that they'd fake an alien threat to get this world government to achieve their political agenda too far-fetched, or is it something we can actually expect to see at some point down the line?
[02:51:05.447 --> 02:51:14.955]  Well, I'm going to shock your listeners, Paul, because I've had nearly a world... I've got a big world view on this and I've had nearly a lifetime of experience in dealing with all this.
[02:51:15.376 --> 02:51:26.145]  The man doesn't know simply what he's talking about and it's just a pity that there isn't some guys from the military who deal with UFOs and kind of like are on a similar theme to me.
[02:51:27.146 --> 02:51:31.429]  How can I describe how this scenario could come about from my own experiences?
[02:51:31.449 --> 02:51:31.489]  No.
[02:51:32.530 --> 02:51:36.113]  No, there will not be a staged alien invasion.
[02:51:36.413 --> 02:51:37.594]  There isn't going to be one.
[02:51:37.974 --> 02:51:45.479]  The back-engineered technology projects that are going on, and there's a possible liaison between the United States government and them.
[02:51:45.979 --> 02:51:46.780]  They know the drill.
[02:51:46.840 --> 02:51:52.323]  These aliens, they were aliens, you call them aliens, but in fact they're people like us, Paul.
[02:51:52.423 --> 02:51:56.186]  A bit more intelligent, a bit taller, a bit different looking, but they're savvy people.
[02:51:56.206 --> 02:51:56.646]  They know the drill.
[02:51:56.666 --> 02:51:57.367]  This is the thing that I've
[02:52:01.109 --> 02:52:03.310]  Picked up from my experiences and it is this.
[02:52:03.990 --> 02:52:19.596]  At the moment if you look at situations in Libya where they went into Libya and I'm sure you will agree this was a if you could call it a Rothschild land grab of the highest degree where they bombed the water supply, bombed the innocent women and children.
[02:52:19.977 --> 02:52:25.539]  In the UK media this was paraded as freedom, as freeing the people of Libya.
[02:52:26.299 --> 02:52:31.723]  And as we well know, this created a condition, Paul, of carnage.
[02:52:32.004 --> 02:52:33.245]  Now the place is unlawful.
[02:52:33.385 --> 02:52:34.686]  Iraq, carnage.
[02:52:35.246 --> 02:52:36.647]  Afghanistan, carnage.
[02:52:36.947 --> 02:52:43.392]  But yet at the very top, lucrative business contracts, lucrative profits, and so on and so forth.
[02:52:43.732 --> 02:52:45.794]  These men who control this power,
[02:52:45.794 --> 02:52:46.734]  We're good to go.
[02:53:04.223 --> 02:53:32.699]  Created like an environment that could manifest conditions for the second coming of an Antichrist and boy oh boy they don't know what they're doing they don't know what power they're dealing with and karma is a very funny thing and so it won't be a fake alien invasion that we will have to deal with it would be the manifestation of an Antichrist that we would have to deal with coming from a direction that we in the UK or the US government would not see coming because there
[02:53:32.739 --> 02:53:32.879]  I think?
[02:53:51.381 --> 02:54:17.698]  Various events that seem to just manner that are malevolence that are going on at the moment everything from the Illuminati to the child sacrifice to the bank heist that's going on at the moment creates an environment a signal in time as it were Paul that can escalate and amplify and turn into something very nasty and then turn upon us and that is what I've picked up from the UFO experiences that I have had.
[02:54:19.861 --> 02:54:33.390]  Here's a quote from, I mean, regarding the false antichrist second coming, that the technology to do mass projections in the sky of that kind of event was available 20, 30 years ago, so... No, no, Paul.
[02:54:33.430 --> 02:54:34.831]  No, no, Paul, I must caution you on that.
[02:54:35.151 --> 02:54:36.132]  This is very serious.
[02:54:36.172 --> 02:54:36.572]  No, no.
[02:54:36.932 --> 02:54:37.773]  You may say that.
[02:54:37.993 --> 02:54:40.074]  You may dismiss it as it being technology.
[02:54:40.554 --> 02:54:41.915]  This is not about technology.
[02:54:41.935 --> 02:54:48.759]  This is about... This is about an element of the mind, an element of biophysical reality that we do not understand.
[02:54:49.079 --> 02:54:51.481]  This is about unknown forces that will manifest.
[02:54:51.821 --> 02:55:05.064]  Paranormal unknown forces, not technology, but paranormal unknown forces, which is why we're being warned by them, continually warned, because all is linked to all, and this is like a signal line in time that's coming back at us.
[02:55:05.385 --> 02:55:14.467]  This is like a paranormal, how can I put it, the Matrix meets Inception kind of thing that I managed to, managed to, that was tossed into.
[02:55:15.427 --> 02:55:17.869]  Um, in a situation that I did not understand.
[02:55:18.189 --> 02:55:20.531]  Don't dismiss it, Paul, because it's absolutely lethal.
[02:55:20.611 --> 02:55:22.913]  The situation could develop into something that's lethal.
[02:55:25.014 --> 02:55:25.955]  Well, I'm not dismissing it.
[02:55:25.975 --> 02:55:28.577]  I'm just saying they've got the capability to do it.
[02:55:29.137 --> 02:55:32.119]  But I asked for people to give questions on Facebook.
[02:55:32.579 --> 02:55:40.084]  Um, one of the key questions is, when people report UFOs and speculate their origin is extraterrestrial,
[02:55:40.985 --> 02:55:46.530]  Isn't that very useful for governments that want to keep black budget programs under wraps?
[02:55:46.570 --> 02:55:51.575]  I mean, we had the B-2 stealth bomber that was being tested 10 years before it was made public.
[02:55:52.736 --> 02:56:01.805]  How many of these UFO reports are merely people misidentifying the latest stealth fighter, the latest technology upgrade for the US military or other militaries?
[02:56:02.265 --> 02:56:02.906]  Quite a few.
[02:56:03.687 --> 02:56:18.161]  Do excuse me, Paul, if I come across as maybe being, what's the word, irritated slightly because I've got a bit of a do going on with all this and it's a very difficult situation to be in and sometimes I'm not myself.
[02:56:19.062 --> 02:56:23.427]  You obviously did understand what I was saying about the Antichrist and you weren't dismissing it.
[02:56:23.967 --> 02:56:25.209]  I can clearly see that.
[02:56:25.829 --> 02:56:30.031]  Yes, so the question was UFOs, black governments, all that kind of thing.
[02:56:31.391 --> 02:56:32.751]  Yes, it is a benefit to them.
[02:56:33.412 --> 02:56:34.212]  It certainly is.
[02:56:35.232 --> 02:56:48.757]  Nick Pope in the UK would argue that these classified claf that fly around, these black budget claf that are flying about are in fact in designated top-secret zones that are not over UK populations.
[02:56:49.097 --> 02:56:54.379]  However, in America, as is clearly seen, some of these triangles that are flying over
[02:56:54.739 --> 02:56:58.720]  But I mean with the Black Triangles, the UK Ministry of Defence said that
[02:57:10.703 --> 02:57:14.245]  Their explanation was people were hallucinating plasma!
[02:57:15.465 --> 02:57:20.707]  I mean, these black triangles are physical craft that's been seen on radar.
[02:57:21.208 --> 02:57:23.609]  I've seen them personally several years ago.
[02:57:25.129 --> 02:57:33.693]  But I think from that perspective, it's likely to be the latest, you know, stealth fighter, the latest top secret technology, as you just mentioned.
[02:57:34.113 --> 02:57:37.315]  But I mean, again on a similar topic with these
[02:57:38.601 --> 02:57:59.680]  These abduction experiences, wouldn't the cover of alien abduction, and I know this has been covered in the UFO research community, wouldn't that be a perfect disguise for governments to carry out mass human experimentation while blaming it on some off-planetary excuse in the entertainment media and mass media in general?
[02:58:00.878 --> 02:58:02.920]  Yes, yes it would be, Paul.
[02:58:03.380 --> 02:58:10.544]  It would be very valid, but it depends what government you're talking about, because there's white government and black government, as you rightly know.
[02:58:10.585 --> 02:58:12.886]  So I think it depends what faction is which.
[02:58:13.246 --> 02:58:23.693]  I think that the factions, the agencies, the clandestineness and the secrecy involved in the UFO cover-up across the world means that the left hand doesn't know what the right hand's doing.
[02:58:24.113 --> 02:58:26.375]  Therefore, you could not get a contingent...
[02:58:26.975 --> 02:58:31.480]  A coherent operation together to deceive en masse.
[02:58:31.860 --> 02:58:35.264]  Because it's not, it's probably not quite as easy as that as it looks.
[02:58:35.664 --> 02:58:39.328]  Not only that, people are having visitations of a peaceful nature.
[02:58:40.128 --> 02:58:44.513]  What is of more concern, as you have rightly said, is the media cranking the fear element up.
[02:58:44.953 --> 02:58:45.854]  We're good to go.
[02:59:09.855 --> 02:59:24.957]  Put it put it kind of like deflect away from peaceful UFO contact and kind of like focus on the fear element because as you as you well know this world is all about fears fear isn't it info wars is all about confronting
[02:59:25.037 --> 02:59:26.699]  It's very beneficial to do so
[02:59:41.306 --> 02:59:48.972]  On the subject of animal mutilations, I mean these are occurring across the world with surgical precision.
[02:59:49.012 --> 02:59:54.516]  They find certain organs, certain body parts removed from cattle and other animals.
[02:59:55.216 --> 03:00:05.684]  Do you think they've also lumped that in with the whole UFO alien thing as a means of downplaying it and making the public think it's non-existent when in fact is a very real phenomenon?
[03:00:06.713 --> 03:00:07.533]  Yeah, I think they are.
[03:00:07.573 --> 03:00:09.074]  I think they are downplaying it, Paul.
[03:00:09.214 --> 03:00:15.476]  I think it is a very real, uh, real phenomenon, and the thing is that that is a very big cover-up going on with that at the, at the moment.
[03:00:15.976 --> 03:00:32.202]  Uh, I know of a man, and I recommend his book on Amazon, a guy called Mike, uh, Freebury, who did a book about cattle mutilations, and they, they absolutely went to hell and back with, with Devon Police here in the UK, I think it was Devon Police, who were refusing photographs
[03:00:33.062 --> 03:00:35.444]  Uh, to him, regarding cattle mutilations.
[03:00:35.504 --> 03:00:45.471]  The point being, he was trying to assist them, because he'd been doing independent research, and he had tried to piece together what was going on, and he was offered to assist them, but Devon Police refused.
[03:00:45.911 --> 03:00:52.435]  And so there was a big Freedom of Information Act, uh, bust up over this, and he eventually got the got hold of the photos.
[03:00:53.216 --> 03:00:56.658]  Um, and they reckon that it was not human what was, what was doing this.
[03:00:56.738 --> 03:00:58.659]  I mean, the conclusion was that it was not human.
[03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:02.602]  Oddly enough, uh, Paul, I was at a UFO conference, and I was talking about all this.
[03:01:02.642 --> 03:01:02.762]  Yes.
[03:01:19.819 --> 03:01:27.207]  Too much going to detail, but she was saying that cattle mutilations were a particularly nasty thing that they had to deal with and it was causing great concern.
[03:01:27.567 --> 03:01:38.819]  But she didn't want to say any more because she'd retired and she didn't want the public hassle of standing up and speaking because she knew what it was like, she said, to be on the radar and harassed, which is what happens, Paul.
[03:01:39.179 --> 03:01:39.800]  It certainly is.
[03:01:41.764 --> 03:01:43.425]  Sorry, go on.
[03:01:44.465 --> 03:01:48.507]  Why, from your experience, why are they performing these mutilations?
[03:01:48.547 --> 03:01:49.348]  What's the purpose?
[03:01:49.948 --> 03:01:53.189]  Well, some would say that it is genetic.
[03:01:54.150 --> 03:01:57.511]  A researcher, Linda Howe, would say that it is genetic.
[03:01:58.752 --> 03:02:07.822]  That it is something that is actually involved in genetic breeding and genetic experimentation and it needs large amounts of blood.
[03:02:08.322 --> 03:02:17.112]  I would say my semi-professional opinion on the cattle mutilation is that we are dealing with a specific non-human entity that is coming in
[03:02:17.752 --> 03:02:32.817]  And that he's actually mutilating them, and I would concur with the researcher Mike Freebury that there's a degree of psychopathy involved in this, that whatever they are, or whatever is causing it, whatever entity it is, is extremely nasty and extremely malevolent in its cause.
[03:02:33.057 --> 03:02:41.820]  But I also subscribe to the point of view that this, Paul, could be the military experimenting with precision lasers, which is a possibility that cannot be ruled out.
[03:02:43.400 --> 03:02:45.001]  I would suggest, yeah, definitely so.
[03:02:45.882 --> 03:02:54.671]  Now I want to look at it from a media perspective now because a lot of UFO researchers are kind of maligned as kooks as you mentioned earlier in the show.
[03:02:55.111 --> 03:03:05.402]  But then we have the History Channel which routinely makes one hour documentaries about UFOs so it seems like the establishment media is trying to have its cake and eat it.
[03:03:05.702 --> 03:03:06.523]  On the one hand they
[03:03:06.903 --> 03:03:10.105]  Maligned people who are into this subject as crazy and paranoid.
[03:03:10.445 --> 03:03:16.148]  On the other hand, they're producing slick, professional, one-hour documentaries on places like the History Channel.
[03:03:16.548 --> 03:03:22.171]  Meanwhile, on the same channel, treating 9-11 truthers like, you know, Holocaust deniers.
[03:03:22.491 --> 03:03:24.372]  So why are they trying to have it both ways?
[03:03:24.433 --> 03:03:30.576]  Why are they trying to promote UFOs as a real, genuine subject, while on the other hand dismissing it as kookdom?
[03:03:31.176 --> 03:03:31.956]  Yes, indeed.
[03:03:32.097 --> 03:03:49.344]  They're not trying to... I think what they're doing, and it's very subtle, but I think what the subject of UFOs and UFOlogy is an interesting one, because what they're doing, what you see in these documentaries, Paul, is just... the documentaries are very focused on strange lights in the sky,
[03:03:49.924 --> 03:03:51.766]  And what went on with those strange lights.
[03:03:52.526 --> 03:03:53.567]  That's what I feel.
[03:03:53.587 --> 03:04:00.393]  There's this continual runaround about people following the strange lights in the sky and what they thought of the strange lights.
[03:04:00.453 --> 03:04:01.754]  And it could be and it couldn't be.
[03:04:02.114 --> 03:04:05.157]  And it doesn't seem to click onto any other level.
[03:04:05.197 --> 03:04:06.638]  It's in a very safe zone.
[03:04:07.058 --> 03:04:09.480]  As a result of that, people watch these programmes.
[03:04:09.840 --> 03:04:12.743]  People, in fact, even go to the conferences.
[03:04:13.163 --> 03:04:17.787]  And you'll hear somebody like, now then, let me springs to mind, who's the guy, the rancher,
[03:04:18.187 --> 03:04:20.330]  Paul, who's the rancher with the UFO experiences?
[03:04:20.370 --> 03:04:21.411]  James Gilliland is it?
[03:04:22.112 --> 03:04:30.501]  I saw him stand up at a conference and he was talking about the fact that he'd met some occupants in the UFOs and they came over to him and gave him a big hug and this, that and the other.
[03:04:30.821 --> 03:04:38.750]  Other researchers will stand up and talk about their experiences but it's just not enough for people who are traumatized by these experiences.
[03:04:39.330 --> 03:04:41.072]  And are trying to search for answers.
[03:04:41.092 --> 03:04:42.092]  They're not getting answers.
[03:04:42.493 --> 03:04:46.516]  And they're certainly not getting answers from the people who are writing the books and doing the documentaries.
[03:04:46.976 --> 03:04:49.038]  And people are banging their heads against the wall.
[03:04:49.118 --> 03:04:51.940]  People have come up to me traumatised and told me some stuff.
[03:04:52.340 --> 03:05:01.648]  I mean, for the US listeners, the number of US Marines and former Vietnam veterans who have emailed me regarding UFO incidents in Vietnam.
[03:05:02.368 --> 03:05:05.571]  One guy emailed me to say that he actually guarded one.
[03:05:06.051 --> 03:05:10.895]  You know, it is absolutely unbelievable and they're approaching with, you know, they're wary.
[03:05:10.976 --> 03:05:15.880]  They are trying to find answers and feel that they're not getting these answers.
[03:05:15.920 --> 03:05:18.462]  You have authors like Whitley Stryber.
[03:05:18.582 --> 03:05:20.624]  There's a book by Colonel John Alexander.
[03:05:21.225 --> 03:05:23.186]  The book talks about UFOs, but it doesn't.
[03:05:23.266 --> 03:05:27.290]  It talks about the meetings he had involving UFOs with other people.
[03:05:27.430 --> 03:05:28.951]  It just does not provide answers.
[03:05:29.512 --> 03:05:31.694]  That's what I feel, Paul, about the issue.
[03:05:33.775 --> 03:05:50.645]  Now, one of the really hardcore cases in this subject is the Rendlesham Forest Bentwaters case because this happened on a US military base in England where, if I'm correct, nuclear technology or nuclear weapons were actually stored at the time.
[03:05:50.685 --> 03:05:53.226]  This was back, I believe, in the late 70s.
[03:05:53.266 --> 03:05:55.488]  Can you explain that case and its significance?
[03:05:56.246 --> 03:06:01.188]  Well, I mean, Rendlesham Forest was classed as Britain's Roswell.
[03:06:01.249 --> 03:06:07.131]  Actually, Rendlesham had another incident in 1956 or 1950 thereabout.
[03:06:07.171 --> 03:06:08.512]  Well, it wasn't Rendlesham Forest.
[03:06:09.853 --> 03:06:16.056]  It's the US Air Base near that that actually had the UFO incident occur in the 1950s.
[03:06:16.496 --> 03:06:16.976]  Woodbridge.
[03:06:17.477 --> 03:06:20.118]  RAF Woodbridge had a UFO event in 1950.
[03:06:20.678 --> 03:06:23.460]  So, it seems to be the repeated theme.
[03:06:23.480 --> 03:06:24.180]  Sorry, Paul, say again?
[03:06:25.714 --> 03:06:26.275]  No, go ahead.
[03:06:26.615 --> 03:06:31.059]  Oh yes, no, it seems to be the repeated theme of UFOs turning up on the premises.
[03:06:31.099 --> 03:06:40.707]  Now, the men of that Air Force Security Police Regiment have a Facebook page called Justice for the 82nd.
[03:06:41.187 --> 03:06:53.178]  What amazes me always about these incidents that happened in Renfrewshire, where we've got the tape of the Colonel, we've got all sorts happening, is that these men are clearly traumatised by what they saw,
[03:06:53.778 --> 03:06:55.580]  And they're clearly being lied to.
[03:06:56.000 --> 03:07:02.805]  And there's incidents of them being taken aside by intelligence people and then told to shut up and all that kind of thing.
[03:07:02.826 --> 03:07:04.287]  They're being continually lied to.
[03:07:04.687 --> 03:07:11.132]  And their frustration and trauma is certainly present on the Facebook page that they have which is called Justice for the 82nd.
[03:07:12.233 --> 03:07:17.236]  And so I always find that there is a human factor that is very much missed.
[03:07:17.276 --> 03:07:32.226]  The effect that the UFO interaction has on people because we have been, we're hidden in a veil, Paul, we're hidden in a veil where the wool has been pulled over our eyes and we are not conditioned to accept other realities that are around us.
[03:07:32.266 --> 03:07:38.411]  We have this terrible malevolent veil around the world at the moment and so these men saw a glimpse outside of that.
[03:07:38.731 --> 03:07:40.732]  Some say, you know, the British M.O.D.
[03:07:40.772 --> 03:07:42.053]  said that it was Orford Lighthouse
[03:07:42.273 --> 03:07:45.675]  There was a few other excuses going on about what it was and what it wasn't.
[03:07:46.055 --> 03:07:49.076]  But those men on that evening know what they saw at Rendlesham.
[03:07:49.737 --> 03:07:56.520]  The rumour was that it was some sort of engine problem that the UFO had and it had landed on the ground and etc etc.
[03:07:57.721 --> 03:08:09.826]  Oddly enough the other human factor occurs with the Berwyn Mountains incident where I was at a conference giving a talk about the Berwyn Mountains UFO incident in Wales and we had to shut the cameras off because a lady stepped forward
[03:08:11.347 --> 03:08:15.349]  She didn't want to go public with this, because she didn't want to, she did not trust UFO researchers.
[03:08:15.809 --> 03:08:26.314]  UFO researchers were going into the village of Corwyn, or whereabouts it happened, and they were pestering people, running off with exclusive rights to the media and all that kind of thing, and this lady had clearly had enough of all that.
[03:08:26.774 --> 03:08:38.560]  So we turned the cameras off, and she came out with this extraordinary story that is not published about the Berwyn Mountains UFO incident in Wales, about the fact that a number of children
[03:08:39.443 --> 03:08:43.885]  ...was suffering laser burns from the UFO incident that happened there and had to be taken to hospital.
[03:08:44.645 --> 03:08:52.047]  And she and three other people were, once again, traumatized, looking for questions, and were not getting answers.
[03:08:52.488 --> 03:09:04.732]  And this comes across continually with incidents at Rendlesham, with incidents at the Berwyn Mountains, with, for the US audience, the former Marines and military people that emailed me from the US, trying to find answers.
[03:09:04.972 --> 03:09:07.474]  And sometimes I'll go, Tony, can you explain this?
[03:09:07.534 --> 03:09:08.675]  And the answer is, no, I can't.
[03:09:09.415 --> 03:09:15.339]  I had an incident this morning, Paul, before I got up, whereby, once again, I was attacked by mind-invasive technology.
[03:09:15.759 --> 03:09:16.880]  I can't explain why.
[03:09:17.120 --> 03:09:18.701]  I know that it's invasive.
[03:09:19.101 --> 03:09:20.723]  I know that it was telling me to shut up.
[03:09:20.803 --> 03:09:21.783]  I know that it's bullying.
[03:09:22.144 --> 03:09:31.950]  I know that they want this kept quiet, because there's a shift, a paradigm shift, across our world at the moment, where the reality is changing, and they don't want that to happen.
[03:09:34.912 --> 03:09:35.693]  We're good to go.
[03:09:54.284 --> 03:10:11.720]  Now we had David Icke on yesterday, Tony, and again he was getting into the theory that this evil, as you said, is so malevolent, so over the top, that he believes there's a non-human presence behind it once you go to the end of the line, and he's talking about...
[03:10:12.867 --> 03:10:12.967]  Yeah.
[03:10:31.421 --> 03:10:38.449]  I mean, I've read David's books and he presents personal accounts of people that have apparently seen these individuals.
[03:10:38.529 --> 03:10:40.512]  I don't classify that as evidence.
[03:10:40.572 --> 03:10:42.794]  I classify it as hearsay.
[03:10:43.475 --> 03:10:46.158]  But, I mean, it's still open to debate.
[03:10:46.198 --> 03:10:52.285]  I mean, what do you think about this premise that these shapeshifters are controlling events from behind the scenes?
[03:10:52.725 --> 03:10:54.726]  Well, it's hard to nail it down.
[03:10:55.006 --> 03:11:10.772]  We have got something that is controlling events behind the scenes, and a number of UFO researchers have concluded, and even Alex Jones on this show, I think, has concluded this, that there is a non-human intelligence behind the scenes that is driving all this.
[03:11:11.392 --> 03:11:17.056]  It's surprisingly enough, the remote viewer, the U.S., for the U.S.
[03:11:17.096 --> 03:11:18.016]  listeners now, the U.S.
[03:11:18.076 --> 03:11:26.762]  military's remote viewer, Remote Viewer 001 Joseph McMoneagle, who entered into the psychic spying program of the United States,
[03:11:27.402 --> 03:11:31.748]  Had an incident with what he believed to be a reptilian in his living room.
[03:11:32.629 --> 03:11:36.173]  And he was awarded medals and so on and so forth.
[03:11:36.213 --> 03:11:47.226]  Now, these remote viewing programs were started in 1970, Paul, because the Soviets were making very big progress in psychic warfare.
[03:11:47.626 --> 03:12:03.732]  But if we rewind back to 1950 and 1949, the American intelligence and military was scratching its head, wondering why their planes were being shot out of the sky by UFOs, and it's documented.
[03:12:04.052 --> 03:12:10.414]  And they weren't just being shot out of the sky at tiny levels, there was things being blasted out of the sky left, right and centre by these UFOs.
[03:12:10.874 --> 03:12:20.005]  And at the time they were sending up F-94 Starfire fighters who were launching salvos of 12 missiles at a time and bringing them down.
[03:12:20.025 --> 03:12:22.067]  Now, back to what you're talking about.
[03:12:22.648 --> 03:12:25.651]  They therefore wondered what the cause was of these UFOs.
[03:12:26.151 --> 03:12:29.372]  Suddenly appearing en masse in their airspace.
[03:12:29.432 --> 03:12:30.792]  Could it be high-powered radar?
[03:12:30.812 --> 03:12:31.413]  They weren't sure.
[03:12:31.873 --> 03:12:51.378]  And so before the remote viewing programs of 1970 and psychic spotting, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, the FBI and the US Army formed something called the Collins Elite, which is like a classic as a psychic equivalent of Majestic 12 really, to find out what was going on.
[03:12:52.467 --> 03:13:08.150]  Their conclusion, and it's something I've concluded before I read this information, their conclusion was that occult ritual, ritual occult goings-on had caused dimensional portals to open
[03:13:08.770 --> 03:13:11.952]  And we were being invaded by something unknown.
[03:13:12.472 --> 03:13:16.414]  And they termed that unknown as non-human entity or N.H.E.
[03:13:16.454 --> 03:13:17.134]  Not alien.
[03:13:17.854 --> 03:13:23.557]  There's a difference between peaceful alien interaction and something that is malevolent and non-human entity.
[03:13:23.837 --> 03:13:25.438]  And I would call it demonic, Paul.
[03:13:25.878 --> 03:13:26.918]  I'd call it demonic.
[03:13:26.958 --> 03:13:28.279]  They called it demonic as well.
[03:13:28.699 --> 03:13:30.300]  And they concluded to their horror.
[03:13:31.781 --> 03:13:38.486]  Which I don't concur to, but the Collins Elite concluded to their horror that there was a possibility that human souls were being abducted.
[03:13:38.506 --> 03:13:44.810]  But they definitely collared and observed something that was extremely malevolent.
[03:13:45.211 --> 03:13:55.218]  And the thing is, you get these, like Bohemian Grove, what Alex has covered, what you've covered on your website to do with Illuminati, Bohemian Grove, all that kind of thing, the extreme malevolence
[03:13:55.758 --> 03:13:56.079]  I don't know.
[03:14:13.200 --> 03:14:15.363]  Very evil and very non-human behind all this.
[03:14:15.743 --> 03:14:20.109]  The chaos that we see today in the banking system isn't caused by, isn't caused by error.
[03:14:20.129 --> 03:14:21.731]  It's not done by, by error.
[03:14:21.792 --> 03:14:26.378]  Libya and all these other conflicts that we see is not caused by the folly of politicians.
[03:14:26.458 --> 03:14:29.882]  It's caused by a driven engine and a driven agenda.
[03:14:30.203 --> 03:14:30.904]  Would you not agree?
[03:14:32.455 --> 03:14:33.115]  Well, certainly.
[03:14:33.155 --> 03:14:48.124]  I mean, the level... People can't acknowledge the level of evil because they think to themselves, well, I would never do that and nobody I know would ever go to that level of monstrosity, so that's why people act not to believe it.
[03:14:51.075 --> 03:14:57.961]  Yeah, and the thing is, as David Ickes rightly said, as he once said, you'd read the headlines and think, they wouldn't do that.
[03:14:58.281 --> 03:14:59.302]  They couldn't do that.
[03:14:59.542 --> 03:15:00.343]  They bloody do.
[03:15:00.943 --> 03:15:01.684]  They really do.
[03:15:01.864 --> 03:15:07.348]  And I've seen it kind of like with what's happened to me, what they're capable of and what they can do and what they are doing.
[03:15:07.709 --> 03:15:16.095]  As Brian Gerrish has rightly said, there is an issue to do with, you know, children, sacrifice, all that kind of thing.
[03:15:16.115 --> 03:15:17.937]  There is an issue about that.
[03:15:18.277 --> 03:15:25.706]  And it's certainly true here in the UK that the Metropolitan Police certainly know where the skeletons are buried on issues like that.
[03:15:25.746 --> 03:15:26.728]  But I digress, Paul.
[03:15:26.748 --> 03:15:27.769]  We'll stick to UFOs.
[03:15:27.809 --> 03:15:29.151]  But you know where I'm coming from.
[03:15:30.678 --> 03:15:40.624]  My producer's interested in this High Brazil mythical island, supposedly off the coast of the country of Ireland and its connection to UFOs.
[03:15:40.664 --> 03:15:42.785]  Have you heard about this one, High Brazil?
[03:15:43.345 --> 03:15:44.606]  No, I haven't, Paul.
[03:15:44.626 --> 03:15:45.466]  No, no, tell them all.
[03:15:45.506 --> 03:15:47.667]  No, it's something I've not heard about.
[03:15:47.827 --> 03:15:48.568]  Ireland does have...
[03:15:49.288 --> 03:16:00.039]  Um, a very high rate of UFOs and Ireland, the Irish government is known for being very secretive about the UFO situation because of course Ireland has a great mystery about it, doesn't it?
[03:16:00.079 --> 03:16:02.201]  So, I'm sure you listen to... Do you know about it?
[03:16:02.221 --> 03:16:03.562]  Because I certainly don't on that one.
[03:16:03.602 --> 03:16:05.024]  Hi, Brazil is something I've not heard of.
[03:16:05.564 --> 03:16:09.650]  It's a new one on me, but the producer's very interested, so maybe you could research that.
[03:16:10.190 --> 03:16:10.511]  I will!
[03:16:11.011 --> 03:16:20.965]  You, underground bases, you SOs, I believe they're called, Unidentified Submergible Objects, what's going on underneath the ground, Tony?
[03:16:21.445 --> 03:16:31.592]  Well, I certainly believe that the UFO I filmed in 1999, which illuminates a TV antenna, which you can see on my website, TonyOppsUFO.com.
[03:16:32.553 --> 03:16:34.054]  TonyOppsUFO on YouTube.
[03:16:34.074 --> 03:16:46.222]  If you have a look at that, you'll see it illuminates a TV antenna, and I strongly believe that that UFO that I filmed was not from another planet as such.
[03:16:46.242 --> 03:16:48.164]  It did not come all the way from another planet.
[03:16:48.684 --> 03:16:52.267]  It had come from an undersea base from somewhere.
[03:16:52.527 --> 03:17:08.521]  We know here in the UK off the coast of Wales and off the coast there of Liverpool and Southport, there have been major incidents of flying triangles flying out at rates of knots over the sea and the situation occurring where jets and so on have chased after them.
[03:17:09.001 --> 03:17:13.625]  I know of a lad I used to work with who worked in the Navy in submarines in Sonar.
[03:17:14.325 --> 03:17:24.508]  And he was telling me when he was on duty on sonar, he was tracking stuff on his sonar system at speeds that Russia and America did not have.
[03:17:24.548 --> 03:17:27.568]  These things were travelling at speeds Russia and America did not have.
[03:17:28.189 --> 03:17:37.251]  And he had to just class it, his officer said you must, you know, class that as dolphins, whales, anything other than mysterious phenomena.
[03:17:37.831 --> 03:17:49.236]  Um, and so there's been various goings-on, uh, with underwater bases out there in the, uh, in the oceans, um, including, uh, incidents, the major incidents, which you might be familiar, Paul, uh, with.
[03:17:49.276 --> 03:17:50.517]  I don't know whether your listeners are.
[03:17:50.537 --> 03:17:52.578]  The incident in the Atlantic, near Norway.
[03:17:53.038 --> 03:18:00.981]  Where it is rumoured that a United States naval ship actually vanished when a triangle craft came over it, that it actually vanished.
[03:18:01.421 --> 03:18:06.744]  Actually that ship did sink and no explanation has been given to the families as to what really happened.
[03:18:07.164 --> 03:18:19.709]  But there was a task force sent by NATO to that area of the Atlantic, I think in Norway, near Norway, because underwater UFOs were tagging the nets of the fishing vessels and causing general mayhem.
[03:18:20.229 --> 03:18:29.155]  And the US Navy turned up on the scene and put an exclusion zone in place and the consequences of that, as I understand it, was a ship disappeared.
[03:18:29.795 --> 03:18:35.439]  So you're dealing with something that is certainly very mysterious in terms of underwater bases.
[03:18:36.459 --> 03:18:43.184]  I mean Christopher Columbus, he recorded that when he was touring to America, when he was sailing to America, he actually saw
[03:18:43.804 --> 03:18:48.127]  An underwater UFO appear and fly off at speed from him.
[03:18:48.527 --> 03:19:04.956]  So the oceans of our planet are definitely populated with them and I think that we have got intelligences out there that are non-human intelligence that are peaceful and occupy our planet's ocean as a matter of course and have been for centuries.
[03:19:06.328 --> 03:19:08.669]  Let me just fire a few more at you.
[03:19:09.430 --> 03:19:11.331]  You talked about disappearing ships.
[03:19:11.711 --> 03:19:13.673]  Philadelphia Experiment.
[03:19:13.733 --> 03:19:14.793]  I'm sure you've heard of that one.
[03:19:14.813 --> 03:19:14.993]  Oh, yeah.
[03:19:15.013 --> 03:19:15.314]  Absolutely.
[03:19:15.354 --> 03:19:16.014]  Perhaps or not.
[03:19:18.411 --> 03:19:19.812]  Uh, I think that was a hoax.
[03:19:20.512 --> 03:19:28.955]  If you, uh, interestingly enough, and this may sound odd, if anybody wants to look at, um, the answers for things, look at what the Russians are saying about some of these issues.
[03:19:28.975 --> 03:19:29.815]  They're very revealing.
[03:19:30.156 --> 03:19:36.538]  Some of the Russian military guys and the, the KGB guys, um, they seem to know the score on a lot of things, mysteriously enough.
[03:19:36.578 --> 03:19:37.618]  I think that was a hoax.
[03:19:38.239 --> 03:19:38.959]  Hoax on that one.
[03:19:40.368 --> 03:19:49.876]  Uh, Bob Lazar claimed to have, uh, back-engineered UFOs at Nevada 51 back in the late 80s, then came out very publicly afterwards with his story.
[03:19:50.297 --> 03:19:52.078]  Bob Lazar a hoax or not a hoax?
[03:19:52.559 --> 03:19:54.220]  Uh, I'm in two minds about that one, Paul.
[03:19:54.440 --> 03:19:54.680]  I am.
[03:19:54.841 --> 03:19:56.162]  I'm in two minds about that one.
[03:19:56.562 --> 03:19:59.465]  Uh, Bob Lazar... Yeah, I'm in two minds.
[03:19:59.505 --> 03:19:59.925]  I don't know.
[03:20:00.306 --> 03:20:03.468]  I don't know what to believe on that issue, a bit like yourself with the reptilians are.
[03:20:03.549 --> 03:20:04.810]  I don't know what to believe on that one.
[03:20:05.610 --> 03:20:05.891]  I don't.
[03:20:07.182 --> 03:20:10.965]  How about, um, I think Sir Peter Horsley, was it?
[03:20:11.025 --> 03:20:16.750]  He was a pretty prominent British officer who claimed to have met an alien.
[03:20:17.270 --> 03:20:18.211]  Yeah, yeah, indeed.
[03:20:18.251 --> 03:20:20.513]  Now, I strongly believe in that one.
[03:20:21.393 --> 03:20:33.523]  And there has been incidents, um, incidents occur, bizarre incidents occur, where people who, um... NATO did a research thing, Paul, called the assessment so it is said
[03:20:34.123 --> 03:20:36.884]  Um, this was said by Master Sergeant Robert Dean.
[03:20:37.385 --> 03:20:43.548]  But basically the gist of the report was about UFOs because they were triggering, uh, they nearly triggered World War 3 on a number of occasions.
[03:20:43.968 --> 03:20:49.490]  But the thing is, what was happening there was the, uh, NATO said that you had aliens that looked like us, exactly like us.
[03:20:49.530 --> 03:20:53.472]  You could walk past one down the street and you would never know, was the famous quote.
[03:20:53.492 --> 03:20:54.973]  You would literally never know.
[03:20:55.613 --> 03:21:05.240]  And so Peter Horsley was sat with somebody who knew about Britain's nuclear program backwards way on and knew a lot of other things as well.
[03:21:05.280 --> 03:21:06.621]  He was a man called Janus.
[03:21:07.282 --> 03:21:12.606]  Although I was misquoted on UK radio station Talk Sport and they thought I said the word Janus.
[03:21:13.366 --> 03:21:19.091]  And then that all went off into this humongous black comedy of, oh, did he see a cleaner?
[03:21:19.131 --> 03:21:20.092]  Was he knocking off?
[03:21:20.172 --> 03:21:21.173]  It was quite hilarious.
[03:21:21.453 --> 03:21:25.216]  The clips on my YouTube site with George Galloway, it was very funny.
[03:21:25.636 --> 03:21:26.597]  I've heard it.
[03:21:26.637 --> 03:21:27.958]  Yeah, oh, you've heard it, have you, Paul?
[03:21:27.998 --> 03:21:29.239]  Right, yeah, it's very funny.
[03:21:29.840 --> 03:21:31.201]  But yeah, so I'm astounded.
[03:21:31.221 --> 03:21:33.683]  Peter Horsley had an incident with the brakes on his car.
[03:21:34.243 --> 03:21:35.184]  He nearly crashed his car.
[03:21:35.224 --> 03:21:36.665]  His brakes had been tampered with.
[03:21:37.066 --> 03:21:39.868]  So I'm one for believing that that happened.
[03:21:41.266 --> 03:21:50.870]  Okay, we're running out of time, but Tony, tonytopping.com, final statement, give your website a plug and just conclude it here.
[03:21:50.910 --> 03:21:53.571]  I mean, how does this tie into the Infowar?
[03:21:53.611 --> 03:21:55.631]  Give us a concluding statement.
[03:21:56.352 --> 03:22:02.854]  It does indeed tie into the Infowar, because what you're doing is you're showing one level of reality that is going on around us.
[03:22:03.274 --> 03:22:06.555]  What you're seeing is something that is happening straight in front of your eyes.
[03:22:06.595 --> 03:22:08.016]  The agenda is plain.
[03:22:08.556 --> 03:22:17.686]  And it is in front of you, but there are some of us who are engaged in the kind of the next level up of what's driving it all, what's going on, whether we like it or not.
[03:22:17.746 --> 03:22:28.517]  And I think the other issue is, before InfoWars listeners, because you're a hard crowd to please, and Alex Jones, who's a hard person to please as well, and yourself, you're critical thinkers and researchers,
[03:22:29.237 --> 03:22:39.581]  I'd like to see a bit more about the UFO researchers being harassed and the consequences of all that, and the human factor behind it all, and I think that would be of great beneficial service.
[03:22:39.641 --> 03:22:48.044]  If researchers in UFOs aren't giving answers, let's hope people like yourself and people like Alex Jones can give people proper answers as to what's going on.
[03:22:48.344 --> 03:22:55.047]  And my site's TonyTopping.com, I am on Facebook, I am on Twitter, and thank you Paul for having me on the show.
[03:22:56.129 --> 03:22:57.550]  Really appreciate it, Tony.
[03:22:57.670 --> 03:22:58.310]  Take care.
[03:22:59.090 --> 03:23:00.071]  Thanks for being on the show.
[03:23:00.091 --> 03:23:01.472]  Been very interesting this morning.
[03:23:02.072 --> 03:23:04.733]  Thank you very much, mate, and good luck with the project that you're working on.
[03:23:05.574 --> 03:23:06.214]  Thanks, Tony.
[03:23:06.234 --> 03:23:10.976]  There goes Tony Topping, UFO researcher, tonytopping.com.
[03:23:11.957 --> 03:23:17.539]  Now we're going to hand it over to Richard Reeves back in the Austin command base.
[03:23:17.680 --> 03:23:18.880]  Richard, are you with me?
[03:23:19.500 --> 03:23:20.001]  Yes, sir.
[03:23:20.081 --> 03:23:22.222]  Mr. Watson, how are you doing over there across the pond?
[03:23:23.401 --> 03:23:25.822]  Have you ever been abducted by aliens, Richard?
[03:23:26.442 --> 03:23:32.963]  Well, thankfully not, and hopefully I can avoid that in the upcoming near and long-term future as well, hopefully.
[03:23:34.984 --> 03:23:38.545]  Have you managed to get much sleep, what with the 24-hour marathon going on?
[03:23:38.985 --> 03:23:52.368]  Well, I did go home, I guess around midnight, and laid down for a while, and tossed and turned in the proverbial bed there, and got up about four o'clock here, Texas time, and ready to rip and roar here, hopefully.
[03:23:53.775 --> 03:23:55.438]  Okay Richard, I'm going to hand it over then.
[03:23:55.478 --> 03:23:58.242]  Tell us about your guests and what information you're going to cover.
[03:23:58.583 --> 03:24:01.728]  I'll say goodbye to the Infowarriors and please donate.
[03:24:01.948 --> 03:24:04.072]  Infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[03:24:04.132 --> 03:24:04.833]  I'm signing off.
[03:24:04.933 --> 03:24:07.136]  Paul Joseph Watson handing it over to Richard Reeves.
[03:24:08.066 --> 03:24:09.567]  Thank you, Commander Watson.
[03:24:09.987 --> 03:24:11.948]  Well, welcome, Info Warriors.
[03:24:12.769 --> 03:24:19.412]  It is Friday, going into the second day of the Money Bomb, completing the 27-hour marathon.
[03:24:20.013 --> 03:24:21.313]  We'll be wrapping up today.
[03:24:21.473 --> 03:24:23.915]  Alex will be in here later at 7 a.m.
[03:24:23.955 --> 03:24:24.555]  Texas time.
[03:24:24.595 --> 03:24:30.498]  In an hour, we're going to have an interview with Charlotte Isserby that we're going to play.
[03:24:30.959 --> 03:24:36.041]  And at 8 o'clock Texas time, Gerald Cilente will be coming on live to
[03:24:37.142 --> 03:24:48.287]  Yes host the program via Skype so make sure and stay tuned in for the final hours if you've held in already this long going on what 20 some odd hours right now.
[03:24:49.727 --> 03:24:55.229]  Hopefully you'll continue being able to listen and watch what's been going on here on the InfoWars Money Bomb.
[03:24:55.710 --> 03:24:57.790]  I want to thank Alex for allowing me to guest host.
[03:24:57.870 --> 03:24:59.371]  What an honor and privilege it is.
[03:24:59.891 --> 03:25:06.494]  The guy is one of the hardest working people on this planet and it's just unbelievable
[03:25:07.034 --> 03:25:11.917]  The amount of workload and the amount of weight on the man's shoulders that he has to juggle.
[03:25:12.338 --> 03:25:15.140]  I don't know how he does it, but he manages to make it happen.
[03:25:15.740 --> 03:25:20.083]  And this audience has to be commended for everything they do.
[03:25:20.143 --> 03:25:23.525]  This audience is the most awesome audience on the planet.
[03:25:23.986 --> 03:25:30.770]  I've been a long-term listener of AM radio, talk radio, ever since I guess the late 70s.
[03:25:31.371 --> 03:25:32.952]  Drove professionally for many years.
[03:25:34.933 --> 03:25:44.240]  My main career and talk radio has been my friend and that's how I found Alex back in 1997-98 right here in Austin.
[03:25:44.260 --> 03:26:01.453]  He was on 98.9 KJFK way back around 1998 and I traveled through Austin frequently and I'd make sure and tune in to Alex Jones back there on 98.9 FM and I've been a listener and now a longtime friend for many years so
[03:26:03.231 --> 03:26:18.963]  I appreciate the audience because I've been one of the audience members for many years and in fact still am one of the audience members and this audience will be ultimately the Paul Revere's that make the big difference in this world.
[03:26:19.023 --> 03:26:20.904]  It's not going to be just the United States now.
[03:26:20.964 --> 03:26:26.889]  The Paul Revere's are going to be across the world, around the world, taking on the New World Order.
[03:26:27.549 --> 03:26:34.971]  You know, back in the 1770s, 1776, those years, it was about the 13 colonies.
[03:26:35.031 --> 03:26:37.652]  It was about starting this country back then.
[03:26:37.832 --> 03:26:47.755]  And now, this is going to be a global event because of the communications, the internet, the what we're doing right now on the web.
[03:26:48.295 --> 03:26:52.296]  It's going to be a very interesting time and has been an interesting time.
[03:26:52.316 --> 03:26:56.617]  That's like one of the things I've been saying here lately is who would have thought
[03:26:58.200 --> 03:27:09.132]  Right after 9-11, especially for those of you that were awake about the New World Order and that were aware of what was going on with the world and the geopolitical environment that we were in.
[03:27:10.486 --> 03:27:31.916]  Think back to 9-11 of 2001 during those events and there were just a very small minority of people knowing that this was a New World Order event inside job to further their police state agenda, to further the surveillance society, to further all of their agenda and that
[03:27:32.856 --> 03:27:38.343]  The police state at that time in the fall of 2001 just seemed so imminent.
[03:27:38.443 --> 03:27:42.589]  It just seemed like, wow, it was all going to come all crashing down.
[03:27:42.629 --> 03:27:47.855]  The police state was going to come down on us and really clamp down on our freedoms.
[03:27:48.456 --> 03:28:03.404]  Yet here we are by some miracle and I think in large part to people like Alex Jones and to you guys, all you folks out there in this audience that have taken the steps to fight against the New World Order.
[03:28:03.764 --> 03:28:10.688]  Here we are 10 years post 9-11 when it seemed like BAM the police state was imminent.
[03:28:11.570 --> 03:28:14.291]  That's when I first met Alex was in the fall of 2001.
[03:28:14.351 --> 03:28:21.674]  I thought after that 9-11 event, I not only had to listen to this man on the radio and see him on Access to Cable TV, but I have to go meet the man.
[03:28:21.714 --> 03:28:28.036]  And so I went up there to Access Cable TV and met him and I had some hot little stories that I thought I'd found on hand.
[03:28:28.076 --> 03:28:31.297]  But of course, Alex is always one step ahead of almost everybody.
[03:28:31.817 --> 03:28:33.658]  He knew about every story I had to give him.
[03:28:34.378 --> 03:28:36.760]  But anyway, here we are.
[03:28:37.300 --> 03:28:40.823]  We've got still a pretty high level of freedom here in the United States.
[03:28:40.843 --> 03:28:43.225]  The First Amendment is still thankfully alive.
[03:28:43.785 --> 03:28:47.828]  Second Amendment is still going strong with a lot of folks waking up about that.
[03:28:48.009 --> 03:28:53.713]  On the left side, especially, we've had Obama be the number one gun salesman.
[03:28:54.394 --> 03:28:56.575]  I gotta give credit to Obama.
[03:28:56.635 --> 03:29:02.380]  People are always shocked whenever I say, I really gotta give Obama some credit about at least two things.
[03:29:02.420 --> 03:29:03.661]  I gotta give him credit.
[03:29:04.597 --> 03:29:10.861]  Number one thing I give Obama credit for is he's been the best gun salesman on the planet.
[03:29:11.361 --> 03:29:12.081]  Bar none.
[03:29:12.561 --> 03:29:14.703]  Obama, number one gun salesman.
[03:29:14.783 --> 03:29:18.345]  I just never will forget those stories about... Excuse me.
[03:29:22.547 --> 03:29:23.107]  I'm sorry, folks.
[03:29:23.167 --> 03:29:26.089]  I haven't been the same since the Red Tide down in South Padre.
[03:29:29.505 --> 03:29:31.646]  Obama, number one gun salesman ever.
[03:29:32.266 --> 03:29:38.908]  It's been amazing how those stories came out when he was first elected, how people rushed out and bought guns.
[03:29:38.948 --> 03:29:54.154]  So I think those articles and those stories had to give the New World Order boys some pause and a little bit of apprehension in them realizing what I think part of what's going on is they're actually building their own prison planet
[03:29:54.614 --> 03:30:00.518]  For themselves if they're not careful and I think that's one reason that really slowed down their agenda.
[03:30:00.878 --> 03:30:07.663]  But the number two thing I've got to give Obama credit for what happened just last November.
[03:30:08.323 --> 03:30:09.344]  Just last November of 2010.
[03:30:10.205 --> 03:30:14.928]  I really got to give him credit because he had over 400 plus years worth of tenure.
[03:30:18.270 --> 03:30:18.511]  I don't
[03:30:36.334 --> 03:30:49.500]  Pretty much every incumbent and thankfully this audience I know is receptive to that idea and I know they've heard that word that we definitely need to fire every incumbent and the primaries are the Achilles heels but Obama
[03:30:50.751 --> 03:30:59.637]  I gotta give him credit on that one, firing over 400 years worth of incumbents in the House and Senate in this last election because of his unpopularity.
[03:31:00.557 --> 03:31:15.246]  I tell you, I think he's created himself not only a lot of enemies on the right, which he's always had, but I think now, to this upcoming 2012 election cycle, Obama has created himself a lot of enemies on the left from his Democrat
[03:31:16.334 --> 03:31:22.517]  Past friends that ended up having their rear end sent home from the House and Senate.
[03:31:22.897 --> 03:31:32.821]  So you've got most likely a lot of disgruntled people on the left and on the Democrat side that are ready to see Obama get fired as well.
[03:31:32.901 --> 03:31:36.123]  So that's gonna be interesting to see how that plays out.
[03:31:36.543 --> 03:31:42.526]  Because that mentality of, hey, he's our Democrat, yeah, we got a bunch of our people fired and
[03:31:43.146 --> 03:31:43.306]  They
[03:31:58.903 --> 03:31:59.363]  We're good to go.
[03:32:22.094 --> 03:32:35.374]  Miraculously growing and getting bigger and bigger and fatter and some of the highest incomes in the country are in Washington DC and so I'm sure many of you guys that keep up with the economy have heard about that story.
[03:32:36.795 --> 03:32:49.221]  All right, so Obama gets credit for two big things, and hopefully in 2012, after the November election, I can give him credit for firing another four or five hundred years worth of incumbents.
[03:32:49.702 --> 03:32:51.022]  That's what I'm looking forward to.
[03:32:51.102 --> 03:32:52.163]  Hopefully it'll be even more.
[03:32:52.223 --> 03:32:56.085]  I'd like to see a thousand years worth of incumbents.
[03:32:56.485 --> 03:32:57.286]  And when I say these
[03:32:59.192 --> 03:32:59.452]  I don't
[03:33:25.205 --> 03:33:45.063]  Back in the spring, we were experiencing gasoline climbing higher and higher in price, and a lot of that was due to the activity in the Middle East that was going on, driven by the New World Order there in Libya, and also in other Middle Eastern countries.
[03:33:46.163 --> 03:33:51.466]  I've been meaning to get with Alex for a while and try to come on the program and cover this topic.
[03:34:04.471 --> 03:34:06.352]  For this hour till 7 a.m.
[03:34:06.372 --> 03:34:18.815]  Texas time is a perfect opportunity for me to kind of discuss what I learned and found out with regards to energy and how it's connected to the economy, connected to the New World Order and their agenda.
[03:34:20.455 --> 03:34:30.438]  And one of the things like I said that was going on back in the spring of 2011 is we did see accelerating and climbing gasoline, oil prices, diesel prices, etc.
[03:34:32.404 --> 03:34:37.665]  And I really got curious as to, you know, what are all the things that they need to do?
[03:34:37.685 --> 03:34:39.265]  You know, Lindsey Williams had come on here.
[03:34:39.325 --> 03:34:41.846]  Most of you guys out there in the audience are familiar with Lindsey Williams.
[03:34:42.386 --> 03:34:47.267]  And he was talking about where the NWO plans to take gasoline and oil prices, etc.
[03:34:47.947 --> 03:34:51.607]  And so I got interested in, okay, what all needs to happen?
[03:34:52.108 --> 03:34:56.688]  What all does the NWO need to do to control these prices?
[03:34:56.748 --> 03:35:00.049]  Because they have a lot of control over
[03:35:01.178 --> 03:35:04.339]  The prices of oil and gasoline, obviously, and they've demonstrated that.
[03:35:04.839 --> 03:35:19.024]  But at the same time, they are at the whim of the market a little bit, somewhat, because there's independent-minded companies out there, and there's the big corporate giants that are running gasoline and diesel and oil.
[03:35:19.044 --> 03:35:26.046]  There's the Exxons and the Mobils, and then you got the countries that have their own interests, and you got Hugo Chavez in Venezuela.
[03:35:28.257 --> 03:35:47.285]  All these different players that work together and disparately to end up controlling all these prices and the NWO at the top of it all trying to pull the puppet strings one way or another about how those prices fall and how they go and who gets supply and who doesn't.
[03:35:49.702 --> 03:36:11.537]  One of the things that really caught my eye was I was doing a little bit of research on stock issues and stock market things and I ran across this story about a pipeline company up in Oklahoma and the story was saying how that back in around March, April of 2011 that this pipeline company up in Oklahoma could not keep up with the supply
[03:36:12.177 --> 03:36:12.357]  I don't
[03:36:30.126 --> 03:36:30.847]  We're good to go.
[03:36:50.748 --> 03:36:51.689]  No, we're good.
[03:37:06.676 --> 03:37:16.188]  Independent companies, entrepreneurs, speculators, different entities have built these big giant tank farms all over the country and Cushing, Oklahoma is one of them.
[03:37:16.228 --> 03:37:24.919]  They built these giant tank farms and they filled them up with oil and they bought oil when it was cheaper and they waited for time to release that oil.
[03:37:25.800 --> 03:37:28.503]  And try to cash in and make profit, of course.
[03:37:28.943 --> 03:37:43.516]  But also, I think these big tank farms all around the country, which by the way, Cushing, Oklahoma is supposedly only represents about 8 or 10% of the oil that is stored by such entities.
[03:37:43.576 --> 03:37:44.997]  So it's only a small percentage.
[03:37:45.037 --> 03:37:49.822]  So if Cushing, Oklahoma was needing to pump oil,
[03:37:51.309 --> 03:38:09.362]  And not having the supply of the pipelines to get it to the Mississippi River Valley where a lot of refineries are, to get it to the big refinery areas like around Houston and Texas, areas like that, they lack the pipeline capacity and can only handle about 10 or 12 percent of the oil coming out of Cushing.
[03:38:09.842 --> 03:38:16.047]  And that's just one of the locations and that only represents about 10 percent of the oil
[03:38:16.977 --> 03:38:17.338]  That is
[03:38:25.288 --> 03:38:41.360]  Slow down the increase in price at that time in the spring, but I'm also believing now that the NWO is probably going back to their drawing board and thinking, wow, we were really looking forward to having gasoline costing six, seven, eight dollars a gallon in the United States.
[03:38:41.861 --> 03:38:51.108]  And I think they actually kind of ran into an overhead supply that they may not have completely realized, anticipated and expected.
[03:38:51.548 --> 03:38:52.569]  And then on top of that,
[03:38:53.129 --> 03:38:57.091]  You've got the issues of oil being discovered all over the world.
[03:38:57.131 --> 03:39:10.797]  You've got a big Canadian find that they're trying to build a pipeline down in the United States and I think they'll end up getting that done probably because there's a lot of lobbying efforts to create the jobs that those pipelines would bring out of Canada.
[03:39:11.318 --> 03:39:12.438]  And let me just say this up front.
[03:39:13.459 --> 03:39:14.379]  I love cars.
[03:39:14.579 --> 03:39:20.502]  I think men in general are somehow instinctively just love
[03:39:20.962 --> 03:39:30.149]  The automobile here in the United States, and we're blessed to be here in the United States where the automobile basically, when it comes to personal transportation, has been king and is king.
[03:39:30.870 --> 03:39:34.192]  And I think it's a symbol of American freedom.
[03:39:34.212 --> 03:39:36.654]  You know, that old Southwest Airlines, a symbol of freedom.
[03:39:36.694 --> 03:39:39.256]  They had the jet on the billboard, symbol of freedom.
[03:39:40.297 --> 03:39:57.596]  Well, I think the original symbol of freedom has been for us the automobile one of the one of the symbols of freedom We've got a lot here in the United States the United States, but the automobile definitely one of the major symbols of freedom and I've often said that they'll pry the car out of my out of my
[03:39:58.817 --> 03:39:59.718]  Cold dead hands.
[03:39:59.778 --> 03:40:01.900]  Kind of like that quote about the gun.
[03:40:01.940 --> 03:40:03.801]  You get my gun out of my cold dead hands.
[03:40:03.841 --> 03:40:06.503]  Well, that's the way it is with the automobile.
[03:40:06.543 --> 03:40:08.805]  I just love transportation.
[03:40:09.265 --> 03:40:17.692]  And I don't think it should matter if we drive a little Yugo or a little Mini Daihatsu or whatever or a Hummer.
[03:40:17.792 --> 03:40:23.917]  I don't think in America that that's the issue of what vehicle we drive or how big it is or whatever.
[03:40:24.537 --> 03:40:25.659]  I don't think that's the problem.
[03:40:25.699 --> 03:40:28.882]  The problem is what are we putting in our tanks?
[03:40:29.043 --> 03:40:30.685]  That is where the monopoly is.
[03:40:31.085 --> 03:40:43.801]  And so that's why I've kind of delved into this subject about energy and there's a lot more connected dots that are upcoming that I kind of found out on what's going on with the overall situation with energy because
[03:40:45.540 --> 03:40:50.303]  The oil, like I said, they've been finding vast reserves up in Canada.
[03:40:50.363 --> 03:40:53.665]  You've got Lindsey Williams has talked about all the oil up in Alaska.
[03:40:54.085 --> 03:41:00.368]  You've got years and years, you know, by some accounts, 100, 200 years worth of oil up in Alaska.
[03:41:00.448 --> 03:41:06.011]  And like I said, me loving cars, I don't want to get out of my car.
[03:41:06.031 --> 03:41:07.872]  You've got more and more cities trying to
[03:41:09.033 --> 03:41:33.593]  put us on rails actually literally on rails like in Austin and in many other cities that's a big agenda in San Antonio Houston Austin all over the world that is a big agenda to get people out of their cars and I'm not 100% against it but when they want to put us out of our cars because of cost then I really have a problem with that because I think transportation needs to remain
[03:41:34.213 --> 03:41:42.617]  Inexpensive and accessible to everybody here in the United States and the agenda definitely by the NWO is to put us out of those cars.
[03:41:43.217 --> 03:41:47.639]  But the cost of oil is a key factor in whether we remain in cars.
[03:41:47.959 --> 03:41:57.544]  But the other key factor is what are the alternatives ultimately gonna be to oil because there will be alternatives and there are alternatives.
[03:41:58.104 --> 03:42:01.286]  I don't think we've come upon the best alternatives yet.
[03:42:01.346 --> 03:42:05.129]  I think the alternatives yet to come, and maybe they're out there.
[03:42:05.189 --> 03:42:10.852]  You hear the stories about the 100 mile per gallon carburetors, etc.
[03:42:10.892 --> 03:42:15.275]  You hear all the different stories about ways to get better gas mileage.
[03:42:16.316 --> 03:42:21.479]  I really think these best methods of getting around our cars is yet to come.
[03:42:22.120 --> 03:42:26.223]  But for now, the NWO, obsessed with control,
[03:42:27.159 --> 03:42:39.083]  Has really got their work cut out for him from my perspective from what I see and it's a blessing for us that it looks like their work is so cut out because you've got these massive oil finds all around the planet.
[03:42:39.483 --> 03:42:45.785]  You've got a lot of offshore drilling going on in Brazil in some big giant oil field discoveries there.
[03:42:46.746 --> 03:42:52.328]  You know we've all heard about Venezuela and their oil and there's probably oil that they've yet to discover here in the Gulf of Mexico.
[03:42:53.428 --> 03:43:07.287]  More and more because of the dilemma the NWO is in, in trying to control the supply and demand and cost of oil, you know, I really have to wonder about that deep horizon, the deep water horizon.
[03:43:08.699 --> 03:43:09.860]  I don't think so.
[03:43:29.065 --> 03:43:29.305]  That's
[03:43:51.345 --> 03:44:11.933]  The growth of nuclear energy has been damaged by the Fukushima event and who could blame countries around the world for really wanting to back off and scratch their head when they're looking at developing more nuclear plants thinking wow look at what happened in Fukushima and then also look at what happened with the flooding in Nebraska with the Calhoun plant
[03:44:13.354 --> 03:44:36.640]  The Calhoun nuclear plant there in Nebraska that was by some reports actually flooded internally and I haven't seen or read any stories on that lately but it's interesting to note how that over the past few months and year we've seen virtually almost all types of energy come under some level of attack.
[03:44:37.180 --> 03:44:40.781]  Some level of event like with nuclear.
[03:44:42.216 --> 03:44:48.442]  Like I was saying, Fukushima incident, Calhoun incident, and then there was another nuclear reactor up in Canada that had some problems.
[03:44:49.843 --> 03:44:55.207]  You've got coal under attack from the carbon emissions angle.
[03:44:56.352 --> 03:44:58.733]  And you've got, you know, coal.
[03:44:59.053 --> 03:45:04.474]  You've got Obama saying that, well, you can build a coal-fired power plant, but you'd go bankrupt.
[03:45:04.994 --> 03:45:05.795]  You remember that quote?
[03:45:05.815 --> 03:45:07.895]  I know Alex has played that on the air many times.
[03:45:08.455 --> 03:45:11.776]  So coal has been under attack for quite a while.
[03:45:11.816 --> 03:45:17.078]  Remember back in the 90s during the Clinton administration when some of the best coal in the world
[03:45:17.658 --> 03:45:17.838]  I think?
[03:45:41.121 --> 03:45:50.407]  Taxpayer money, the economic benefit of digging up coal to fund some of their education and all their state projects, things like that.
[03:45:50.487 --> 03:45:54.049]  So coal has been under a long-term attack.
[03:45:54.169 --> 03:45:59.872]  And then the other thing that I ran across is I'm studying all this about the oil in the spring of 2011.
[03:46:00.513 --> 03:46:02.574]  I'm studying about the Deepwater Horizon event.
[03:46:02.614 --> 03:46:03.975]  We got Fukushima going on.
[03:46:04.015 --> 03:46:07.177]  We got flooding in the Midwest with the Calhoun nuclear plant.
[03:46:07.717 --> 03:46:14.521]  We've got coal being attacked by governments and the global warming agenda.
[03:46:14.922 --> 03:46:24.168]  We've got one of the other things that I learned was under attack, especially with all the European economic debacle.
[03:46:24.208 --> 03:46:27.610]  And you've got a lot of countries that are backing away.
[03:46:29.355 --> 03:46:43.602]  from their heavy spending habits and one of the victims of governments backing off from all of their excess spending of money that they don't have or of over taxation of their people.
[03:46:44.382 --> 03:46:50.585]  One of the victims in Europe and also somewhat here in the United States is the alternative energies.
[03:46:51.646 --> 03:47:01.384]  Um, you know, the Darlings, they were there, the Green Energies, and not that I'm necessarily a fan of them, uh, and some of them I think they're farcical, some of them, you know, they might work or whatever, but...
[03:47:03.231 --> 03:47:10.293]  A lot of these alternative energies like wind and solar were counting on big government subsidies.
[03:47:11.133 --> 03:47:20.196]  Hence, we had the big Solyndra story, you know, where they had, I think, half a million dollars and it's basically evaporated and disappeared here in the United States with the Solyndra story.
[03:47:20.216 --> 03:47:26.617]  And now they're talking about, you know, indicting and investigating the Obama administration's activities in helping Solyndra.
[03:47:33.672 --> 03:47:55.937]  We've got a lot of these alternative energies, not that they were necessarily great or fantastic or going to save the world and all that, but it's interesting to see that it's almost like some level of industrial espionage going on to play with the supply and demand and the viability of all forms of energy.
[03:47:56.077 --> 03:48:02.178]  I just keep looking at the different things, you know, you've got the wind situation with the windmills and they're
[03:48:03.078 --> 03:48:03.558]  You know what?
[03:48:24.131 --> 03:48:49.408]  a deepwater horizon event or maybe even now it makes me more suspicious that all of a sudden you had these nuclear plants you had Fukushima, Calhoun and that plant up in Canada like almost three in a row boom boom boom you know you really had to start to wonder and the rumors have been out there of exactly what is going on in the case of Calhoun plant they said that that flooding was
[03:48:50.629 --> 03:48:54.891]  Pretty much intentionally done by the Corps of Engineers and those reports came out.
[03:48:55.391 --> 03:49:10.237]  So you really have to wonder when it comes to energy and we really have to watch in particular because one way to keep the cost of energy low, which is really key, one of the key factors to keeping our economy at least at the level it's at.
[03:49:10.277 --> 03:49:11.337]  Our economy is hurt.
[03:49:11.797 --> 03:49:12.958]  There's no doubt about that.
[03:49:13.018 --> 03:49:14.658]  Our economy is hurt.
[03:49:14.778 --> 03:49:15.799]  It's limping along.
[03:49:17.239 --> 03:49:39.387]  I've driven taxis here in Austin for a long time and we just as a person in the transportation industry it's almost like we've got our fingers on the pulse of the economy a lot of times because we rely a lot on travelers coming in and out of the airport going in and out of the hotels convention business and all that and just these stories like for instance this past summer
[03:49:39.947 --> 03:49:40.748]  We're good to go!
[03:49:59.887 --> 03:50:02.250]  Cheap gasoline, inexpensive gasoline.
[03:50:02.310 --> 03:50:09.921]  If you've got inexpensive diesel, then that is one of the biggest factors that dictates how the economy goes.
[03:50:10.422 --> 03:50:11.843]  And to give you an example,
[03:50:13.266 --> 03:50:16.689]  Actually, maybe to give you maybe more than one example, two or three examples.
[03:50:17.490 --> 03:50:21.454]  I grew up basically and first started driving back in the 70s.
[03:50:21.954 --> 03:50:28.240]  And I can actually remember when gasoline was 18 cents a gallon, 20 cents a gallon, 30 cents a gallon, that range.
[03:50:28.621 --> 03:50:31.663]  You know, the first car I had was a big Buick with a big
[03:50:32.563 --> 03:50:41.195]  Gas hog engine, you know, eight cylinder engine burning, uh, using about seven, uh, a gallon for every seven miles, a gallon for every eight miles.
[03:50:42.076 --> 03:50:47.744]  And it was no big deal though, because you could go get 20, 20 gallons for, you know, five or six bucks.
[03:50:48.385 --> 03:50:53.129]  So that was really, we just didn't know how good we had it back then.
[03:50:53.189 --> 03:50:57.973]  Okay, you know, people didn't make the kind of money that they make nowadays, but that's, you know, because of inflation.
[03:50:58.554 --> 03:51:08.522]  But still, filling up your tank, you know, 20 gallons for five or six bucks, picture what that would do for our economy right now if somehow there were a big giant rollback.
[03:51:08.583 --> 03:51:10.184]  I don't expect it to happen at that level.
[03:51:10.784 --> 03:51:13.947]  But if we could see gasoline down at the buck 25, buck 50 level,
[03:51:16.209 --> 03:51:19.840]  You know, that would really be one of the big things to spur the economy.
[03:51:20.281 --> 03:51:22.928]  But back in the 70s, that's one of the first...
[03:51:24.119 --> 03:51:37.748]  I guess in my lifetime, the first gas crunch that I can remember, there might have been other shortages, so-called shortages, prior to when I can recall, but that's the first one I remember really vividly because I was living it in the 70s.
[03:51:38.629 --> 03:51:48.896]  And back then, we learned that ultimately gasoline and oil were not going to be the solution to keep us being transported here in the United States.
[03:51:48.996 --> 03:51:50.717]  We learned that back in the 70s.
[03:51:51.317 --> 03:51:52.318]  That was a big lesson.
[03:51:52.418 --> 03:51:53.078]  And back in the 70s,
[03:51:54.539 --> 03:52:05.386]  We saw gasoline go from, like I said, around $0.18 a gallon, $0.30 a gallon range, up to $1.50 a gallon.
[03:52:05.907 --> 03:52:12.931]  And so taking it from $0.30 to $1.50 was a five-fold increase, five times higher.
[03:52:13.312 --> 03:52:20.036]  So imagine nowadays where we were like in the, I guess about a year ago,
[03:52:21.457 --> 03:52:23.318]  We were around the $2.50 range.
[03:52:24.318 --> 03:52:30.942]  Imagine if they had taken it from $2.50, five-fold, five-fold increase.
[03:52:31.122 --> 03:52:33.943]  Imagine what that would have done to our economy.
[03:52:34.964 --> 03:52:36.745]  $12.50, $12.50 a gallon.
[03:52:36.785 --> 03:52:39.606]  Can you imagine the shutdown that would have created?
[03:52:39.646 --> 03:52:45.829]  So that would have been more equivalent to kind of what happened in the 70s because of that five-fold increase.
[03:52:46.329 --> 03:52:47.190]  So it really
[03:52:47.890 --> 03:53:15.205]  crunch the economy here in Texas I don't know about everywhere but here in Texas we actually had gas lines at the gasoline stations there were you know the NWO had I think even more control obviously probably of on gasoline oil back then or maybe they just haven't implemented as much control yet they they probably have that same level of control if they want to to where we can have once again gasoline lines at the stations but here in Texas
[03:53:15.825 --> 03:53:30.112]  We actually had gasoline lines at the stations and at one point there was actually a rationing of a sense because you could only get gasoline on an odd or even day that matched your license plate.
[03:53:30.132 --> 03:53:40.478]  So in other words, if your license plate number ended in a 1, a 3, 5, 7, 9, then you could get gasoline on an odd numbered day if your license plate was 0, 2, 4, 6, 8,
[03:53:42.859 --> 03:53:46.001]  Then you could get gas on an even-numbered day.
[03:53:46.061 --> 03:53:57.770]  So there was a former rationing back then in the 70s here in Texas up in the Dallas-Fort Worth area where I grew up and fortunately we haven't seen those types of events
[03:53:58.930 --> 03:54:01.892]  At least not on a countrywide scale.
[03:54:02.012 --> 03:54:16.141]  I'm not sure even back then, you know, here you most time you just focused more on what's going on locally, obviously, and especially as a young man, a teenager at the time, you know, I'm just paying attention kind of more to what's going on locally and not nationwide and certainly not worldwide.
[03:54:16.661 --> 03:54:17.341]  So I don't know how
[03:54:18.542 --> 03:54:19.723]  We're good to go.
[03:54:43.945 --> 03:54:52.330]  Fast forward though, here we had gasoline diesel prices up over a dollar gallon for years and years and years.
[03:54:52.790 --> 03:54:59.074]  Once we eclipsed the dollar figure back in the 70s, you know, we ranged up into $1.25, $1.50, you know, $1.30 range for many, many years.
[03:54:59.094 --> 03:54:59.514]  And frankly,
[03:55:05.752 --> 03:55:20.102]  Never thought that I would see gasoline back under a dollar a gallon but you know a little while ago I was talking about how it's such a such a factor on the economy price of gasoline diesel and to demonstrate that is we actually
[03:55:21.062 --> 03:55:30.006]  Believe it or not, and I couldn't believe it when it happened, we actually in the late 90s saw gasoline prices go below a dollar a gallon.
[03:55:30.106 --> 03:55:30.787]  I couldn't believe it.
[03:55:30.947 --> 03:55:39.011]  It was literally almost like Christmas every day, especially being an independent contractor and having to buy gasoline every day.
[03:55:39.591 --> 03:55:40.352]  It was amazing.
[03:55:40.412 --> 03:55:43.574]  And think about the economy we had in the late 90s.
[03:55:44.014 --> 03:55:52.940]  That was one of the most popping, humming economies in the late 90s that we may ever see in our lifetime, or at least in my lifetime.
[03:55:53.420 --> 03:55:54.981]  Think of the things that came together.
[03:55:55.542 --> 03:55:59.604]  And a lot of people try to give Bill Clinton credit for the economy in the 90s.
[03:56:00.025 --> 03:56:05.829]  I tell you what, that guy, he's just the lucky guy that he was president at that time when it comes to the economy.
[03:56:05.869 --> 03:56:08.831]  Because think of all the things he had going on.
[03:56:09.731 --> 03:56:15.917]  Starting in the early 90s, mid 90s, building up into the late 90s, you had the internet coming on.
[03:56:16.418 --> 03:56:20.362]  You had all that build out of the infrastructure of the internet.
[03:56:20.422 --> 03:56:27.408]  That still continues somewhat today, but back then in the 90s, you had fiber optic cable being laid everywhere.
[03:56:27.489 --> 03:56:30.952]  You had roads being dug up for fiber optic cable.
[03:56:31.432 --> 03:56:33.594]  All the infrastructure for the internet.
[03:56:34.235 --> 03:56:37.076]  You had cell phones just blowing up.
[03:56:38.176 --> 03:56:41.056]  My first cell phone I had in 1997.
[03:56:41.556 --> 03:56:48.538]  And now kids grow up and they get their cell phone, you know, when they're kids and they can't imagine a world without cell phones.
[03:56:48.658 --> 03:56:51.058]  And now it's hard to imagine a world without cell phones.
[03:56:51.478 --> 03:56:59.440]  But think of the infrastructure that had to go into the behind the scenes of making the cell phone industry work.
[03:56:59.500 --> 03:57:01.020]  The towers, all the different
[03:57:02.213 --> 03:57:03.755]  We're good to go.
[03:57:24.938 --> 03:57:27.259]  I didn't even mess with a computer till around 1997.
[03:57:27.379 --> 03:57:32.462]  I'm still pretty bad on the keyboard, even after 14 years.
[03:57:32.502 --> 03:57:36.924]  But here I was in 1997, would have been approximately late 30s, early 40s.
[03:57:40.726 --> 03:57:54.989]  Had never really messed with computers and here in 1997 I'm taking some of my first trips to the library in Dallas, Texas to get on a computer there for free and working on that slow internet from the that we had back in the late 90s.
[03:57:55.029 --> 03:57:58.030]  So it's just amazing what happened in the late 90s.
[03:57:58.390 --> 03:58:01.651]  Like I said, you had the hardware of the PCs blowing up.
[03:58:01.691 --> 03:58:08.352]  You had the internet coming on board and being built out and not just here in the United States, but obviously worldwide.
[03:58:09.932 --> 03:58:10.472]  We're good to go.
[03:58:35.003 --> 03:58:36.804]  The Gasoline
[03:59:04.963 --> 03:59:22.246]  I can't say that we've seen the worst of the economy yet, that's for sure, but it's going to be this audience that's going to make a difference in trying to stop them because whenever we see activities, whenever we see what's going on, it's like I was talking about the Cushing story in Oklahoma earlier.
[03:59:22.646 --> 03:59:23.987]  Those reports helped come out.
[03:59:24.027 --> 03:59:30.208]  I think those reports that came out with the oversupply and the overhead supply of oil are what helped.
[03:59:30.908 --> 03:59:36.794]  Push back that agenda of trying to get gasoline up to $6 and $7 a gallon.
[03:59:37.214 --> 03:59:53.070]  I really believe that and so it's info warriors out there in this audience that bring these stories to the forefront that get them reported and then Alex can sit here with this powerful microphone and his powerful voice and get these stories out and that's how they make a difference.
[03:59:53.430 --> 03:59:53.930]  I mean when
[03:59:54.611 --> 04:00:01.459]  The Drudge Report puts his links on to Infowars and all the other stories that DrudgeReport.com comes out with.
[04:00:03.080 --> 04:00:11.670]  It really does make an impact, I believe, and would we ever potentially see another economy like we had in the late 90s?
[04:00:13.032 --> 04:00:13.492]  I don't know.
[04:00:13.572 --> 04:00:17.213]  I mean, think of the convergence of all these different build-outs that occurred.
[04:00:17.653 --> 04:00:29.256]  Cell phones, hardware for computers, PCs, the Internet itself, and the build-out that occurred there, and then all these companies figuring out ways to take advantage of the Internet.
[04:00:29.336 --> 04:00:35.838]  A brand new industry, a huge, what is now a huge industry, and it's still in development.
[04:00:35.918 --> 04:00:37.898]  Actually, we're still really in the early stages.
[04:00:38.318 --> 04:00:41.539]  Here it is, 2011, and the Internet really has only
[04:00:42.239 --> 04:00:57.579]  Really kind of come on board since the late 90s so it's all is still very young overall think of the automobile back when it was invented and think looking back now how we've had the automobile for you know 100 plus years or however long and
[04:00:59.463 --> 04:01:11.772]  At that time, let's say only 15 or 20 years into the age of the automobile, looking back now, those automobiles were just antique by today's standards and back then they were state-of-the-art.
[04:01:12.312 --> 04:01:15.175]  So here we are with the development of the Internet.
[04:01:15.575 --> 04:01:17.056]  Who knows where it's all going to go?
[04:01:18.337 --> 04:01:26.283]  But hopefully we'll still maintain the level of freedom on the Internet and if there's some way to increase that level of
[04:01:27.338 --> 04:01:29.639]  Freedom and First Amendment freedom on the web.
[04:01:30.380 --> 04:01:31.060]  Hopefully it will.
[04:01:31.680 --> 04:01:37.443]  But that economy of the late 90s was really something to behold.
[04:01:38.064 --> 04:01:50.170]  And part of what really made it hum, along with those buildouts of cell phones, PCs, Internet, etc., and the cheap gasoline on top of it all, was just amazing.
[04:01:50.230 --> 04:01:51.931]  And then you had a stock market where you had
[04:01:52.871 --> 04:02:14.085]  Millionaires that were made over a period of three or four or five years and they're out there spending their money So that's why I'd say that and of course pretty much everybody knows here in the United States the inexpensive Gasoline is a big key to our economy and I think one way that we can get some of that back and
[04:02:15.239 --> 04:02:22.127]  Get our economy back is to fight for and expose just how much oil is out there.
[04:02:22.808 --> 04:02:25.571]  I personally, like I said, I'm not a big fan of oil.
[04:02:25.591 --> 04:02:26.452]  That's the monopoly.
[04:02:26.572 --> 04:02:28.134]  Ultimately, we need to get away from but.
[04:02:30.447 --> 04:02:31.168]  We're good to go.
[04:02:51.770 --> 04:03:01.880]  One thing the NWO appears to do is they appear to ratchet up gasoline prices up into the higher ranges that we've never seen, like the $4 gallon range, etc.
[04:03:02.300 --> 04:03:06.144]  But then, you know, alternatives start to come online and it squashes them.
[04:03:06.184 --> 04:03:09.327]  So, I don't know what the ultimate answer is there to
[04:03:10.248 --> 04:03:30.719]  Keep our gasoline oil prices inexpensive and to keep our more importantly to keep transportation prices inexpensive that is a big key to our economy so who knows what the final solutions are going to be to that but you know what I have faith in the fellow Americans here on InfoWars and
[04:03:32.000 --> 04:03:44.211]  In general, that we will come up with solutions to keep transportation inexpensive and that is a major, major factor to thwart the NWO is creating our own economies.
[04:03:44.631 --> 04:03:49.115]  Doing stuff like Longevity, the Infowarsteam.com.
[04:03:50.076 --> 04:03:57.262]  I think more and more people are going to get on board with those types of companies like Infowarsteam and the Longevity products because
[04:03:59.013 --> 04:04:07.499]  We've got to have many times more than one gig, so to speak, more than one job, more than one business.
[04:04:07.919 --> 04:04:13.823]  The multitasking effect, the same as what we do on the internet, seems to be kind of the way of the future.
[04:04:14.303 --> 04:04:23.870]  And I think that opportunities like Infowars team are going to be critical to keeping Americans working and to keeping Americans prosperous.
[04:04:24.210 --> 04:04:27.112]  Here we have an opportunity to really go international.
[04:04:27.692 --> 04:04:28.992]  With this business.
[04:04:29.172 --> 04:04:35.074]  I was researching that more here recently and I didn't realize that they're already in a lot of countries.
[04:04:35.094 --> 04:04:36.674]  They're already in 50, 60 countries.
[04:04:37.214 --> 04:04:43.676]  So if you've got friends and family over there, that's a good opportunity to get a worldwide business going.
[04:04:44.396 --> 04:04:52.298]  And so I think that and that's just one example of the ingenuity that Americans have had in the past and will continue to have.
[04:04:52.358 --> 04:04:55.039]  So I've got a lot of faith in my fellow Americans.
[04:04:56.039 --> 04:04:56.699]  Okay, wow.
[04:04:56.979 --> 04:04:58.420]  I've already talked 47 minutes.
[04:04:58.460 --> 04:05:00.361]  That's hard to believe that I already talked 47.
[04:05:00.921 --> 04:05:05.582]  I printed out all this news to cover and obviously I'm not going to cover much of it.
[04:05:05.823 --> 04:05:07.683]  I'll tell you what, let's open up.
[04:05:08.463 --> 04:05:10.064]  No, let's not open up the phones.
[04:05:10.364 --> 04:05:12.305]  I'm going to try to cover a little bit more news.
[04:05:13.125 --> 04:05:21.472]  And during the last five minutes, I want to talk a little bit about the upcoming Ron Paul campaign and how exciting that's going to be for 2012.
[04:05:22.293 --> 04:05:23.454]  So stay tuned for that.
[04:05:23.854 --> 04:05:30.460]  But in the meantime, speaking of the economy, you know, I guess most of y'all keeping up with the news here on Infowars.com.
[04:05:30.500 --> 04:05:35.564]  And I know a lot of y'all Coast to Coast fans and Drudge Report fans, etc.
[04:05:37.405 --> 04:05:55.807]  Fully aware that they've got the g20 going on in Cannes France can France and Obama's over there and a lot of world leaders are there And we've had this European economic debacle going on now for months and one of the things that we've all been expecting and I
[04:05:57.816 --> 04:06:18.592]  We've all been expecting and I think will certainly at some point come to fruition will be that they're gonna pump a lot of liquidity into that European economy and I think ultimately they'll be pumping a lot more liquidity into the US economy but they've slowed down on that to some degree I think because of the protests of
[04:06:19.512 --> 04:06:19.913]  I think?
[04:06:34.668 --> 04:06:35.289]  We're good.
[04:06:56.929 --> 04:07:03.052]  There are probably a lot of top-level people in some of these subsidized alternative energy companies that are stealing the money.
[04:07:03.132 --> 04:07:11.436]  Kind of like when we send billions of dollars to other countries around the world, a lot of times that crooked leadership runs off with a good
[04:07:12.136 --> 04:07:12.556]  Good to go.
[04:07:39.750 --> 04:07:39.990]  I don't
[04:08:04.841 --> 04:08:19.578]  They're having the G20 in Cannes, France, and they're discussing boosting that liquidity through the IMF, which ultimately, I think the IMF and you folks out there in the audience will probably agree, the Federal Reserve and the IMF, there's probably not a whole lot of difference.
[04:08:19.618 --> 04:08:20.679]  They're linked at the hip.
[04:08:21.340 --> 04:08:22.642]  They're like Siamese twins.
[04:08:24.063 --> 04:08:38.350]  So, look for that to happen because I think that the NWO has to be concerned that if they allow their economy to really go down the tube and really go down the skids, that more and more people wake up.
[04:08:38.410 --> 04:08:49.596]  That's the danger, is yeah, they put a lot of people out on the street, they put people out there homeless, they put them out there destitute, they're on the European version of food stamps, etc., whatever.
[04:08:51.647 --> 04:09:12.766]  More and more people wake up to who the gangster banksters and the geopolitical leaders and movers and shakers really are so they've got to walk an economic tightrope there and that's why I think that they will ultimately flood Europe with liquidity and they're going to figure out ways to pump it out there even if they have to subsidize
[04:09:13.667 --> 04:09:25.099]  Basically any kind of upstart company, any kind of mom-and-pop company, they'll probably end up doing it, which ultimately will end up most likely being highly inflationary.
[04:09:25.480 --> 04:09:30.806]  But at least, you know, it's kind of like they inject a little bit of morphine to make the patient feel better.
[04:09:31.386 --> 04:09:47.709]  Temporarily at least and then they have to inject more morphine with this liquidity so it looks like after months and months of wrangling and haranguing that it may finally happen over there in Europe and the United States will definitely be involved in helping make that happen I think.
[04:09:48.703 --> 04:09:50.805]  The European leaders are appealing to the U.S.
[04:09:50.865 --> 04:09:53.988]  and basically Obama has responded that they're on their own.
[04:09:54.508 --> 04:09:55.950]  But, you know, they're really not.
[04:09:56.070 --> 04:09:58.352]  The Bernanke's are going to be involved.
[04:09:58.952 --> 04:10:05.098]  And so it's going to be interesting to see how they handle this European debacle.
[04:10:05.679 --> 04:10:09.762]  And I've got mixed feelings about that because one thing I've noticed is that, hey,
[04:10:10.743 --> 04:10:11.484]  What do you think?
[04:10:28.465 --> 04:10:28.685]  I think so.
[04:10:50.003 --> 04:10:52.325]  I think it's key to support the show.
[04:10:52.365 --> 04:10:56.447]  I haven't mentioned it yet, but InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[04:10:56.828 --> 04:11:03.372]  This is part of the InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com that we're doing today, a full 27 hours.
[04:11:03.792 --> 04:11:08.996]  We've got Alex will be coming on later in the broadcast today, in about six minutes.
[04:11:09.436 --> 04:11:16.761]  We've got Charlotte Iserby coming on with an interview, and then at eight o'clock, live via Skype, will be Gerald Solente.
[04:11:17.842 --> 04:11:26.207]  Keep on listening to InfoWarriors and I want to continue thanking this audience and I tell you, Alex Jones is a powerful individual.
[04:11:26.548 --> 04:11:27.788]  He's done a lot by himself.
[04:11:27.828 --> 04:11:31.571]  He proves every day that one man can make a difference.
[04:11:31.611 --> 04:11:32.451]  Let me say that again.
[04:11:32.531 --> 04:11:36.174]  He proves it on a daily basis that one man can make a difference.
[04:11:36.214 --> 04:11:39.256]  But I tell you, without this audience,
[04:11:40.399 --> 04:11:40.779]  I think so.
[04:11:54.620 --> 04:11:56.041]  Operation continued to grow.
[04:11:56.061 --> 04:12:01.666]  He gives back to the community by hiring fellow patriots and other people and bringing them on board.
[04:12:02.186 --> 04:12:14.676]  And he really is now looking to, this upcoming year, go out on the road and meet more InfoWarriors and visit more areas of the country and talk to more people out there.
[04:12:15.276 --> 04:12:16.897]  All right, we've got five minutes to go.
[04:12:17.117 --> 04:12:19.880]  Didn't cover hardly any of the news that I thought I'd cover.
[04:12:20.220 --> 04:12:21.041]  No surprise there.
[04:12:21.841 --> 04:12:26.044]  I guess it happens to me all the time, even when I was doing Access Cable TV, that's what would happen.
[04:12:26.064 --> 04:12:27.986]  I would be ready with all this news and couldn't cover it.
[04:12:28.086 --> 04:12:35.792]  But... Alright, that red tide still kicking me in the chest.
[04:12:35.892 --> 04:12:48.662]  But, one of the most important things we can do, along with supporting InfowarsMoneybomb.com, along with supporting Infowars.com, and along with supporting Ron Paul,
[04:12:49.582 --> 04:13:00.236]  On his website, Ron Paul 2012, is we've got to get ourselves to the precinct conventions and precinct caucuses in these upcoming primaries.
[04:13:00.296 --> 04:13:02.479]  Folks, it's going to be critical.
[04:13:04.355 --> 04:13:06.316]  We need to get out in front of this right now.
[04:13:06.396 --> 04:13:09.539]  You need to get your yard signs out, your bumper stickers out.
[04:13:10.019 --> 04:13:11.860]  Do what's called drive-by canvassing.
[04:13:11.900 --> 04:13:12.761]  Do that right now.
[04:13:12.841 --> 04:13:14.502]  Learn where your precinct is.
[04:13:15.323 --> 04:13:16.543]  Get your map.
[04:13:16.603 --> 04:13:17.444]  Go to your county.
[04:13:17.884 --> 04:13:24.909]  Call up whoever you need to to find out where your precinct boundaries are, where they lie, and get a map of your precinct.
[04:13:25.550 --> 04:13:28.772]  And now is the time to get those bumper stickers, yard signs out.
[04:13:29.833 --> 04:13:37.776]  Go out and find your neighbors, your fellow neighbors out there with bumper stickers and yard signs for Ron Paul or like-minded candidates.
[04:13:37.796 --> 04:13:43.878]  There's other candidates I'm sure in your areas that are along the lines of Ron Paul and InfoWarriors.
[04:13:44.439 --> 04:13:47.600]  Go out there and find your neighbors in your precinct.
[04:13:48.240 --> 04:14:05.455]  Those are going to be the first ones you want to find and you guys get together and call a huddle and make out a plan to attack and take over the rest of your precinct and by that I mean politically speaking of course is go out
[04:14:06.175 --> 04:14:06.495]  I don't
[04:14:19.963 --> 04:14:21.044]  We're good to go.
[04:14:42.407 --> 04:14:42.747]  I don't know.
[04:14:57.700 --> 04:15:05.405]  Actually, less than 80 doors that I need to knock on in my precinct to find my 30 or 40 Debra Medina voters.
[04:15:06.066 --> 04:15:15.672]  Because a lot of these households, it might be husband and wife or son and daughter or whatever that are voting age that have voted from that one household.
[04:15:17.427 --> 04:15:25.050]  Use those strategies to find your fellow InfoWarriors, to find your fellow Ron Paul revolutionaries, etc.
[04:15:25.130 --> 04:15:30.271]  And the time to find those folks in your precincts is right now.
[04:15:30.692 --> 04:15:32.752]  This is dead serious right now.
[04:15:32.812 --> 04:15:43.056]  Our best opportunity to make Ron Paul the Republican presidential nominee for 2012, our best opportunity is going to be via the convention process.
[04:15:43.556 --> 04:15:54.519]  Because you can fully expect the NWO is going to swing those levers and hit those switches and punch those buttons to black box us at every turn.
[04:15:54.579 --> 04:15:59.461]  You see them black boxing us, so to speak, in these so-called scientific polls.
[04:16:00.001 --> 04:16:08.564]  Alex proved back in 2007, in the fall of 2007, I'm surprised he never talks about it, but Alex actually commissioned a poll
[04:16:09.750 --> 04:16:21.025]  Back in the fall of 2007 to show that Ron Paul was one of the leaders if not the leader and even the poll he commissioned tried to skew the poll that Alex had commissioned.
[04:16:21.065 --> 04:16:26.893]  It was amazing and maybe he'll talk about that in the upcoming future programs but
[04:16:27.974 --> 04:16:32.456]  Even in the major, so-called mainstream polls, watch for the shenanigans there.
[04:16:33.217 --> 04:16:35.718]  Alex proved that it goes on in the polls.
[04:16:35.778 --> 04:16:37.839]  So, don't trust the polls.
[04:16:38.299 --> 04:16:39.740]  Don't trust these pollsters.
[04:16:40.200 --> 04:16:41.341]  Don't trust anything.
[04:16:42.281 --> 04:16:43.101]  Take action.
[04:16:43.241 --> 04:16:48.144]  Get out in your precincts and motivate and connect with your fellow Infowarriors.
[04:16:48.564 --> 04:16:49.264]  Think about this.
[04:16:49.304 --> 04:16:56.308]  Think of it, if a total economic depression calamity happened, how important it would be to know your like-minded neighbors.
[04:16:57.529 --> 04:17:01.350]  Just for that reason alone is why you should connect to your neighbors.
[04:17:01.850 --> 04:17:22.534]  So get out there, get in your precincts, get to know your fellow InfoWarriors, and then when it comes time for your precinct convention, your precinct caucus, this upcoming 2012 election, it's absolutely imperative that you show up with every Ron Paul supporter and InfoWarrior you can muster to these events, because if we end up being a majority,
[04:17:23.254 --> 04:17:28.586]  In the precinct conventions, and that's politics at the atomic level.
[04:17:29.208 --> 04:17:31.152]  If you have an atom that is
[04:17:32.699 --> 04:17:42.563]  If you have like 10 Adams, and 80% are Ron Paul Adams, and 2% are Rhino Adams, in each precinct convention on average, then guess what?
[04:17:42.623 --> 04:17:49.726]  When it comes to the Republican National Convention, we will be a majority, and that's how Ron Paul gets to be the Republican nominee.
[04:17:49.806 --> 04:17:51.186]  Okay, I'm already a little bit over.
[04:17:51.766 --> 04:17:55.668]  Folks, we've got a great interview with Charlotte Isserby coming up, so stay tuned.
[04:17:56.741 --> 04:18:09.225]  This next hour, Charlotte Israeli, then Gerald Salente coming up live via Skype right after Charlotte Israeli, and then Alex Jones will be back later today to wrap up with the 27-hour Money Bomb.
[04:18:09.625 --> 04:18:11.445]  Infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[04:18:11.785 --> 04:18:17.907]  Folks, get out there, email to your friends, call your friends, let them know, and make this Money Bomb a success.
