[00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.823]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.823 --> 00:00:11.424]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.424 --> 00:00:12.965]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.965 --> 00:00:17.148]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.148 --> 00:00:21.211]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.158 --> 00:00:34.442]  Well, we've got Jennifer Jones popping back in with us from Quartzsite, Arizona.
[00:00:34.442 --> 00:00:41.828]  The Arizona Republic has the headline here in my stack.
[00:00:41.828 --> 00:00:45.772]  Quartzsite officials reject mayor's martial law claim.
[00:00:46.963 --> 00:00:56.816]  Now, the mayor is saying that they reportedly are saying that they want martial law there, but they're now denying that.
[00:00:56.816 --> 00:01:03.584]  I remember in Milwaukee five years ago or four years ago, the city council in closed session discussed martial law.
[00:01:04.065 --> 00:01:06.068]  You didn't want to have them raise taxes?
[00:01:06.068 --> 00:01:07.911]  You want to do recalls of them?
[00:01:07.911 --> 00:01:11.416]  Well, they'll just declare martial law and never have elections again, I guess.
[00:01:11.416 --> 00:01:12.618]  She's popping in.
[00:01:12.618 --> 00:01:18.466]  Jennifer Jones, one of the activists who has been arrested, even when she has time on the...
[00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:31.457]  Roster to speak at Citizens Communication This is a microcosm what's happening in Quartzsite Of what's happening across other towns and cities in the United States and of course with the federal government.
[00:01:31.457 --> 00:01:44.866]  It's called out of control bureaucrats And people in government who think they're God so she's gonna be popping in briefly with an update on that Maybe we should get the mayor on that's probably also would be a good idea to try for that also
[00:01:45.786 --> 00:01:54.519]  Dr. Jerome Courtsey will be joining us for 30 minutes at the start of the second hour to give us an update on birth certificate gate.
[00:01:55.674 --> 00:01:57.715]  Now, interspersed with all these guests today, we're going to be talking
[00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:26.121]  About a huge issue.
[00:02:26.121 --> 00:02:29.125]  Well, we've got actually a huge plate of issues here.
[00:02:31.152 --> 00:02:35.193]  France tells Libya rebels to seek peace with Gaddafi.
[00:02:35.193 --> 00:02:40.455]  So it looks like they're beginning to balk at a ground war or this just may be on the surface.
[00:02:40.455 --> 00:02:43.976]  But Italy a month ago called for a ceasefire.
[00:02:43.976 --> 00:02:45.056]  So this is a big deal.
[00:02:45.056 --> 00:02:47.397]  We're going to be breaking that down.
[00:02:47.397 --> 00:02:54.319]  Obviously, Syrian protesters attack U.S.-French embassies after ambassadors visited opposition stronghold.
[00:02:57.136 --> 00:03:00.519]  So things are heating up on that front.
[00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:21.416]  I have reserved comment on the whole Rupert Murdoch hacking scandal and the shutdown of a very old newspaper, the News of the World, a very old tabloid, because I wanted to gauge things and do some more research, but I do have my breakdown and take on that today.
[00:03:21.416 --> 00:03:23.798]  We've got Bachman,
[00:03:25.131 --> 00:03:53.429]  Really taking the lead in key battleground states like Iowa for El Presidente with Mitt Romney and Ron Paul right behind and Bachman is better than Palin but at the end of the day it doesn't matter because at a certain point the bureaucracy could care less what a president does or doesn't do and if a president doesn't directly confront government drug dealing, government weapons shipments
[00:03:54.428 --> 00:03:55.544]  Like Ron Paul has done.
[00:03:57.137 --> 00:03:57.777]  I don't know.
[00:04:26.468 --> 00:04:30.431]  Government will be universally hated and distrusted as it should be.
[00:04:30.431 --> 00:04:32.893]  And we'll get back to some common sense founding father principles.
[00:04:32.893 --> 00:04:34.254]  I don't want Obama to be back in.
[00:04:34.254 --> 00:04:35.595]  I want Ron Paul.
[00:04:35.595 --> 00:04:40.860]  But, at a certain point, we don't need to compromise with Michelle Bachman.
[00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.181]  Or anybody else for that matter.
[00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:43.562]  Mitt Romney, there's no compromise.
[00:04:43.562 --> 00:04:51.969]  He's a gun grabbing, open border loving, Obama healthcare, takeover writing, globalist.
[00:04:53.251 --> 00:04:56.797]  And Al Gore praises him, of course, for loving carbon taxes.
[00:04:56.797 --> 00:04:57.879]  Oh yeah, he's for that as well.
[00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:58.259]  Stay with us.
[00:05:04.523 --> 00:05:05.784]  Tyranny is here.
[00:05:05.784 --> 00:05:09.428]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:05:09.428 --> 00:05:11.950]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:17.815]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:05:17.815 --> 00:05:24.061]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:05:24.481 --> 00:05:30.423]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:05:30.423 --> 00:05:34.645]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:05:34.645 --> 00:05:38.926]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:05:38.926 --> 00:05:44.869]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:05:44.869 --> 00:05:48.430]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.391]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:05:50.391 --> 00:05:50.831]  It's here.

[00:07:00.124 --> 00:07:01.285]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:07:01.285 --> 00:07:08.209]  citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:07:08.209 --> 00:07:10.491]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:07:10.751 --> 00:07:16.135]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:07:16.135 --> 00:07:19.177]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:07:19.177 --> 00:07:21.498]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:07:21.498 --> 00:07:27.742]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:07:27.742 --> 00:07:31.124]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:07:31.124 --> 00:07:36.908]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:07:36.908 --> 00:07:38.549]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:07:38.549 --> 00:07:39.690]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:42.511]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:07:42.511 --> 00:07:46.732]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:07:46.732 --> 00:07:51.354]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[00:07:51.354 --> 00:07:53.955]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[00:07:53.955 --> 00:07:57.816]  Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[00:07:57.816 --> 00:08:01.357]  That's endofamerica3.com.
[00:08:01.357 --> 00:08:06.899]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:16.775 --> 00:08:27.682]  We've got a big report with our top story today coming out in T-minus one hour at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:08:27.682 --> 00:08:43.033]  I stayed up late last night doing more research to confirm the pattern, and we've got two special video reports that'll also be in the article going up at InfoWars.com, Obama Establishing Dictatorship.
[00:08:43.033 --> 00:08:44.374]  Now, I wanna be clear here.
[00:08:45.222 --> 00:08:57.326]  The executive branch has been eroding the power of not just the states, but of the legislative, that's the Congress, as well as the courts.
[00:08:57.326 --> 00:09:05.208]  But to a certain extent, the executive has teamed up with the courts in their war against the Bill of Rights, Constitution, and Declaration of Independence.
[00:09:05.208 --> 00:09:08.769]  And so this is a dictatorship of the bureaucracy
[00:09:11.056 --> 00:09:15.779]  And special interests that finance and control elected representatives.
[00:09:15.779 --> 00:09:23.544]  And they have been enshrining in the presidency what other oligarchies have done throughout history in every culture.
[00:09:23.544 --> 00:09:34.232]  Mesoamerican, Chinese, Japanese, African, Middle Eastern, Roman, Byzantine, before that Greek, Persian, it goes on and on and on.
[00:09:34.232 --> 00:09:40.596]  That's why oligarchies like kings or dictators or strongmen, Carol Quigley,
[00:09:41.336 --> 00:09:58.370]  Bill Clinton's mentor at Georgetown, head of political science, who wrote the thousand-page book, Tragedy and Hope, only a thousand copies printed, for the State Department and CIA, so that they could understand that the left-right paradigm was fraudulent.
[00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:04.755]  In fact, I meant to pull up this morning, will you pull up Carol Quigley's quote on how both parties are controlled?
[00:10:04.755 --> 00:10:08.078]  And to get into the specifics of the quote, you know,
[00:10:08.758 --> 00:10:16.523]  And the whole book's about this, that both parties should not oppose each other in reality, only on the surface.
[00:10:16.523 --> 00:10:22.568]  And so that there would only be degrees of differences within a very narrowly defined spectrum.
[00:10:23.539 --> 00:10:48.613]  And that over time, they would be able to transfer power completely into the executive, and that that was the plan of Wall Street controlling Big Pharma, Big Agra, the Pentagon, through global deals and globalism, worldwide standardization of policies to shut down all competition that is not part of the inside coterie of globalists.
[00:10:48.613 --> 00:10:50.934]  And you can see that happening today, of course,
[00:10:51.494 --> 00:10:54.876]  Because the book was government-funded.
[00:10:54.876 --> 00:10:56.858]  The plates got out.
[00:10:56.858 --> 00:10:59.259]  Well, first, one of the books was attained.
[00:10:59.259 --> 00:11:02.601]  Quigley later wrote books about it and admitted, yes, I wrote that for the government.
[00:11:02.601 --> 00:11:06.404]  Yes, I was allowed into the private corporate annals that run the government.
[00:11:06.404 --> 00:11:08.305]  I believe world government is good.
[00:11:08.305 --> 00:11:10.527]  The public is too dumb to be free.
[00:11:10.527 --> 00:11:11.948]  We're doing a good thing for you.
[00:11:11.948 --> 00:11:16.451]  And he wrote public books like the Anglo-American Establishment and others.
[00:11:17.331 --> 00:11:21.234]  But this is a fact, that this is how the world works.
[00:11:21.234 --> 00:11:41.847]  You can read the books written by Barry Goldwater, where he publicly exposed this corporate fascist, corporatist system that's the opposite of free market, and what he called crony capitalism, which listeners have pointed out and I agree with them, should be called crony collectivism, or elite sponsored crony collectivism.
[00:11:41.847 --> 00:11:42.127]  Okay?
[00:11:43.991 --> 00:11:59.634]  The big news today is that Obama is accelerating the process, and it's hidden in plain view, of the executive completely disregarding Congress.
[00:12:01.266 --> 00:12:06.671]  Ron Paul, a month ago, gave a speech titled, The Last Nail in the Republic's Coffin.
[00:12:06.671 --> 00:12:15.180]  And he said, if they're able to continue this war in Libya, then we were two plus months in, now we're three and a half months in, if they're able to continue this war in Libya,
[00:12:16.437 --> 00:12:20.781]  And Congress has filed lawsuits on Obama.
[00:12:20.781 --> 00:12:23.484]  They have said, you've got to come to us for authorization.
[00:12:23.484 --> 00:12:25.225]  We'll even give you authorization.
[00:12:25.225 --> 00:12:26.046]  We love war.
[00:12:26.046 --> 00:12:27.207]  We're totally corrupt.
[00:12:27.207 --> 00:12:29.469]  Remember, we launched all these other wars before you.
[00:12:29.469 --> 00:12:31.591]  We're bought and paid for by the same people.
[00:12:31.591 --> 00:12:35.294]  Just we want to maintain and be relevant.
[00:12:35.294 --> 00:12:41.861]  Or why will big defense contractors even finance our campaigns to be their slaves if you run everything?
[00:12:42.661 --> 00:12:46.642]  We want some of the power here at the mafia table.
[00:12:46.642 --> 00:12:50.223]  And Obama said, listen, I don't need you.
[00:12:50.223 --> 00:12:52.223]  Let me reissue a letter.
[00:12:52.223 --> 00:12:54.523]  I'm doing this for the credibility of the UN.
[00:12:54.523 --> 00:12:56.184]  That's a quote.
[00:12:56.184 --> 00:12:58.584]  I don't need to talk to you.
[00:12:58.584 --> 00:13:01.965]  I'll do whatever I want.
[00:13:01.965 --> 00:13:10.167]  That is what Caesar did when he began to take control of the Roman legions without senatorial authorization in the Roman Empire 2,000 plus years ago.
[00:13:13.581 --> 00:13:20.564]  That is what they did, what, 2,030, no, 2,040 years ago.
[00:13:20.564 --> 00:13:23.165]  So that's what he did.
[00:13:23.165 --> 00:13:28.067]  That's taught in any mainline history, that's tyranny, that's tyrannous.
[00:13:28.067 --> 00:13:38.372]  You read about third world dictators in Latin America, Africa, Eastern Europe, Asia, who will get elected and then start dissolving the power of the parliament.
[00:13:38.372 --> 00:13:40.333]  They keep the parliament or the Congress there.
[00:13:41.573 --> 00:13:48.436]  But basically, anybody that doesn't go along with it ends up dying in plane crashes or being arrested for corruption.
[00:13:48.436 --> 00:13:50.977]  Saddam Hussein did the same thing when the U.S.
[00:13:50.977 --> 00:13:55.059]  put him in as the head of the Baathist Party in 1979.
[00:13:55.059 --> 00:13:56.800]  This is how it's all done.
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.581]  We've been through this thousands of times.
[00:13:59.417 --> 00:14:02.519]  Thousands of times throughout history they found the Quigley quote.
[00:14:02.519 --> 00:14:17.166]  Please put it on screen the Argument that the two parties should represent opposed ideas and policies One perhaps of the right and the other of the left is a foolish idea acceptable only to the doctrinaine
[00:14:18.326 --> 00:14:21.887]  Or doctrinaire, and academic thinkers.
[00:14:21.887 --> 00:14:35.993]  Instead, the two parties should be almost identical, so the American people can throw the rascals out at any election without leading to any profound or extensive shifts in policy.
[00:14:35.993 --> 00:14:41.355]  Source, Tragedy and Hope, 1968.
[00:14:41.355 --> 00:14:47.418]  Written for the Department of State to be delivered to high level CIA section chiefs.
[00:14:48.078 --> 00:14:51.144]  So they could understand what they were doing.
[00:14:51.144 --> 00:14:52.487]  Over a thousand pages.
[00:14:52.487 --> 00:14:53.469]  I suggest you read it.
[00:14:55.373 --> 00:14:58.936]  And what first in the early 70s, one leaked.
[00:14:58.936 --> 00:15:01.817]  Patriotic groups got it, made a few thousand copies.
[00:15:01.817 --> 00:15:04.719]  Then later, plates were stolen.
[00:15:04.719 --> 00:15:07.181]  There's good patriots on the inside who don't want to be total slaves.
[00:15:07.181 --> 00:15:12.465]  You look at your children, that'll wake you up to join the side of light and get you away from darkness.
[00:15:12.465 --> 00:15:18.509]  And now there's a whole bunch of publishers that put them out because it again was government funded, so there's no real copyright.
[00:15:20.589 --> 00:15:24.233]  Plus, Quigley didn't want to make a stink out of it because that would then bring attention to it.
[00:15:24.233 --> 00:15:29.299]  This is a manual on how to enslave people and make them think they're free.
[00:15:29.299 --> 00:15:35.226]  Now, it's been bad since the killing of Kennedy with the executive grabbing power.
[00:15:36.636 --> 00:15:37.957]  And again, it's the bureaucracy.
[00:15:37.957 --> 00:15:53.549]  And if you look at all the major agencies, they're a revolving door of the former CEOs, presidents, top vice presidents, people, the top 10 layers or more in every major Fortune 100 company.
[00:15:53.549 --> 00:15:58.734]  They rotate in and out of every federal agency, every federal bureaucracy.
[00:15:58.734 --> 00:16:03.938]  That's why the healthcare laws written by the insurance companies on record to rip everybody off.
[00:16:04.682 --> 00:16:10.665]  The carbon tax laws written by Big Oil to then shut down their competition.
[00:16:10.665 --> 00:16:22.151]  That's why Big Agra openly writes the Food Safety Acts to where they're exempt from everything, but small farms are literally SWAT-teamed for no reason, and you can't bake your neighbor a strawberry pie.
[00:16:22.151 --> 00:16:23.611]  Literally.
[00:16:23.611 --> 00:16:27.373]  This is total bondage to shut you down.
[00:16:27.373 --> 00:16:29.514]  What do you expect these megacorporations to do?
[00:16:29.514 --> 00:16:30.575]  They're ruthless.
[00:16:30.575 --> 00:16:31.975]  They're hyper-competitive.
[00:16:31.975 --> 00:16:33.136]  They're non-free market.
[00:16:34.295 --> 00:16:37.256]  They want, what did the founder of the Rockefeller dynasty say?
[00:16:37.256 --> 00:16:39.477]  Competition is a sin.
[00:16:39.477 --> 00:16:42.439]  He wrote that in his own autobiography.
[00:16:42.439 --> 00:16:45.921]  Competition is a sin of the monopolist.
[00:16:45.921 --> 00:16:48.582]  We're fighting monopolists, monopolists.
[00:16:48.582 --> 00:16:59.267]  We're not fighting communists, we're not fighting socialists, we're fighting monopolists who, we've been falsely taught in school that fascism is the opposite of communism.
[00:16:59.807 --> 00:17:01.789]  No, it is true communism.
[00:17:01.789 --> 00:17:10.015]  And that's why, what, 10 years ago, the Chinese president BBC headline, Chinese communism is the greatest expression of capitalism.
[00:17:10.015 --> 00:17:11.917]  And the article made fun of him.
[00:17:11.917 --> 00:17:14.379]  No, no, that was veritas.
[00:17:14.379 --> 00:17:17.822]  That was the essence of truth.
[00:17:17.822 --> 00:17:27.370]  Chinese communism, according to the model of capitalism that isn't free market that we have, because they interchange labels, this crony capitalism, this crony collectivism,
[00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:31.151]  Chinese communism is the greatest expression.
[00:17:31.151 --> 00:17:44.557]  The top generals, the top families, the million or so party officials of the billion and a half people in China, they own and run everything and they are just billionaires wallowing in palaces while the people starve to death.
[00:17:44.557 --> 00:17:45.778]  That is communism!
[00:17:47.412 --> 00:18:03.500]  Under the Russians, communism, giant villas, racehorses, hundreds of mistresses, total gods in the inner party, in the Duma, absolute rulers, total control, working with Armand Hammer, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, building all the big plants.
[00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:06.282]  That is, see, they tell you communism exists.
[00:18:06.282 --> 00:18:12.785]  They tell you the answer to the bankers, the answer to the robber barons, the answer to the corruption.
[00:18:12.785 --> 00:18:14.506]  It's everything you've been taught's a lie, folks.
[00:18:14.506 --> 00:18:15.547]  All the terms are scrambled.
[00:18:16.207 --> 00:18:19.249]  It's all hiding there in plain view.
[00:18:19.249 --> 00:18:26.873]  You're taught, you fight the bankers by getting a red flag and going out and calling for communism.
[00:18:26.873 --> 00:18:35.818]  All the big billionaires right now calling for the carbon taxes when they have giant yachts and private trains and helicopters and dozens of palaces and homes.
[00:18:35.818 --> 00:18:39.060]  Trillions of dollars in the aggregate that they control.
[00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:42.802]  Hundreds and hundreds of billions in their war chest individually.
[00:18:42.802 --> 00:18:44.743]  Bill Gates is not the richest man, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:46.533 --> 00:18:56.692]  He's mid-level new nouveau riche brought into the fold because his dad was a top eugenicist and a top intelligence officer who they really appreciate his human phobia.
[00:18:57.833 --> 00:19:02.556]  You got homophobia, human phobia, their hatred of humanity, their cold-bloodedness.
[00:19:02.556 --> 00:19:05.858]  The globalists in DARPA had to control all the new big computer companies.
[00:19:05.858 --> 00:19:10.121]  They couldn't have IBM own them all because of trust laws being semi-enforced at that time.
[00:19:10.121 --> 00:19:14.464]  So they created fake groups like Google, like Microsoft, like Yahoo.
[00:19:14.464 --> 00:19:20.068]  Now all admitted, as I told you over a decade ago, now totally admitted government created all of it.
[00:19:20.068 --> 00:19:21.269]  Government run.
[00:19:21.269 --> 00:19:24.531]  But the profits are then shuttled to those key families.
[00:19:24.531 --> 00:19:24.671]  Now,
[00:19:26.536 --> 00:19:30.602]  So the essence of this is consolidation, and now under Obama.
[00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:54.424]  It was like they were an SR-71 Blackbird that was already going Mach 2 towards total executive power, the abolition of the Constitution, the separation of powers, the Congress being rendered servile, vestigial, ceremonial, a archaic vestige, scrap of what it was.
[00:19:54.424 --> 00:19:59.307]  Now they have gone up to Mach 5 in the SR-71 Blackbird of tyranny.
[00:20:00.472 --> 00:20:02.993]  What would you do with a check for $25,000?
[00:20:02.993 --> 00:20:08.315]  What if you could eliminate all of your credit card debt in 90 days and keep all of your money?
[00:20:08.315 --> 00:20:18.839]  Hi, I'm Jason Davenport, and I've just completed Zerodet100.com, a program that stops and prevents debt collections of all kinds, including debt collectors and foreclosures, with guaranteed results.
[00:20:18.839 --> 00:20:20.140]  Forget loan modifications.
[00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:26.322]  Zerodet showed me how to get the banks to pay my property taxes and insurance while stopping my foreclosure without paying one dime.
[00:20:26.502 --> 00:20:31.944]  An attorney tried to garnish my wages, but the court denied his request because of what I filed from the Zero Debt Program.

[00:21:39.227 --> 00:21:46.292]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:21:46.292 --> 00:21:47.153]  Hi, Ted Anderson.

[00:23:53.054 --> 00:23:53.154]  Okay.
[00:23:53.154 --> 00:23:54.656]  Let me break this down.
[00:24:20.814 --> 00:24:33.598]  Coming up next hour at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, the big report that Paul Watson and I have been working on since last night is going up with the videos that I've already shot that are on the Alex Jones YouTube channel.
[00:24:33.598 --> 00:24:37.659]  Obama establishing dictatorship is one of them.
[00:24:38.962 --> 00:24:42.907]  And then if you expand, there's another Obama attempting to set up dictatorship.
[00:24:42.907 --> 00:24:44.970]  I shot two different videos.
[00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:49.075]  Now understand, people are going to say, oh, you said that was happening under Bush.
[00:24:49.075 --> 00:24:51.398]  You said it was happening under Obama.
[00:24:51.398 --> 00:24:53.200]  No, I've always been clear.
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.864]  They are transferring power to the federal government.
[00:24:57.059 --> 00:24:58.699]  They are destroying the Republic.
[00:24:58.699 --> 00:25:01.940]  They are destroying checks and balances with Homeland Security.
[00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:04.281]  TSA destroying Tenth Amendment rights.
[00:25:04.281 --> 00:25:07.462]  Remember I told you eight years ago TSA would start being on the streets?
[00:25:07.462 --> 00:25:11.063]  Because I watched them on C-SPAN say that was their plan.
[00:25:11.063 --> 00:25:16.404]  And to buy or sell or have a job, you'll have TSA authorization on your ID card.
[00:25:16.404 --> 00:25:19.045]  To buy a gun, you'll have authorization.
[00:25:19.045 --> 00:25:20.786]  What did Obama announce on Friday?
[00:25:20.786 --> 00:25:25.767]  We now have the details from even the NRA's own website and the Huffington Post praises it.
[00:25:27.222 --> 00:25:38.988]  Obama to sign an executive order and to do what Rahm Emanuel, we have that in our video reports, called for when he was a congressman and then as a chief of staff, a no-fly, no-buy.
[00:25:38.988 --> 00:25:40.449]  That was always the plan.
[00:25:40.449 --> 00:25:49.233]  I saw under Ridge, this isn't just Obama folks, they were talking about this eight years ago on C-SPAN with the TSA and Governor Ridge.
[00:25:49.233 --> 00:25:52.635]  And I've since pulled up the original transcripts and articles and proven all that.
[00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:56.182]  So they're telling us what they're going to do.
[00:25:56.182 --> 00:26:07.491]  The Huffington Post in an article, Obama to unveil gun control reforms in the near future, the White House spokesman says that, don't worry, this is stuff we can all agree on.
[00:26:07.491 --> 00:26:08.652]  That's mind control.
[00:26:08.652 --> 00:26:13.476]  We can all agree I'm gonna come to your house and you're gonna sign the deed over for nothing to me.
[00:26:13.476 --> 00:26:18.900]  We all agree I'm gonna come over to your house and you're gonna give your model wife to me, Bob.
[00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:21.983]  We all agree that you're going to give me all your jewelry.
[00:26:22.725 --> 00:26:24.185]  We all agree on that.
[00:26:24.185 --> 00:26:25.886]  You're like, oh, we all agree.
[00:26:25.886 --> 00:26:29.627]  See, it's all a Svengali mind control move.
[00:26:29.627 --> 00:26:30.988]  And that's the way they're spinning it.
[00:26:30.988 --> 00:26:37.750]  Oh, it's just some reasonable executive order to add some things into the instant check.
[00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:44.792]  And not that you're a felon or even a misdemeanor, but that we think you might have mental problems after Jared Lee Loeffner, because there's crazies like him.
[00:26:44.792 --> 00:26:49.734]  Now you've all got to give up your rights and we're going to put you on magic list like no fly list.
[00:26:51.041 --> 00:26:55.946]  And they go on to say, still executive actions offer something that legislation doesn't.
[00:26:55.946 --> 00:26:57.328]  Guaranteed results!
[00:26:57.328 --> 00:26:58.930]  Man, getting tough!
[00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:07.118]  And as one gun control advocate told the Huffington Post, there are ways to quote, use these administrative changes to obtain similar results.
[00:27:07.118 --> 00:27:10.722]  And he's going to order the Attorney General to just restrict more
[00:27:11.803 --> 00:27:14.625]  International guns legally being shipped in.
[00:27:14.625 --> 00:27:20.088]  Also they tried last year in Texas, right through to California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico.
[00:27:20.088 --> 00:27:23.150]  Remember telling gun shops, you can only sell one gun now.
[00:27:24.209 --> 00:27:25.249]  And they said, but that's not the law.
[00:27:25.249 --> 00:27:28.830]  And they said, well, we're telling you because of U.S.
[00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:30.931]  guns going into Mexico causing violence.
[00:27:30.931 --> 00:27:33.632]  Turns out they were the ones shipping them in.
[00:27:33.632 --> 00:27:34.392]  30,000 guns.
[00:27:34.392 --> 00:27:37.433]  Most of the media keep saying 1,800.
[00:27:37.433 --> 00:27:41.294]  But if you go to Reuters and the court filings, this is Reuters, U.S.
[00:27:41.294 --> 00:27:44.035]  agents slam gun sting effort on Mexico border.
[00:27:44.895 --> 00:27:58.639]  Of the nearly 30,000 firearms recovered in 2010 where a gun is possessed, some 70% were determined to have come from the United States, and it turns out most of those from the ATF shipment.
[00:27:58.639 --> 00:27:59.780]  So there you go.
[00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:07.802]  And the truth is, most of the guns you do find in Mexico that are from the U.S., the normal semi-auto and stuff, that's things that Mexicans get illegally to protect themselves.
[00:28:07.802 --> 00:28:10.863]  The cartels are using fully auto grenade launchers, armored vehicles.
[00:28:11.932 --> 00:28:12.793]  Okay.
[00:28:12.793 --> 00:28:15.674]  And the people are trying to defend themselves and, oh, you can't do that.
[00:28:15.674 --> 00:28:21.478]  So continuing here, Obama to unveil gun control reforms in the near future.
[00:28:21.478 --> 00:28:22.018]  And guess what?
[00:28:22.018 --> 00:28:25.400]  He's going the executive route.
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:28.722]  Obama can't get his internet kill switch passed in cybersecurity.
[00:28:28.722 --> 00:28:29.503]  So what have they announced?
[00:28:30.891 --> 00:28:49.645]  Earlier this year they're going ahead with it and the four branches of the military to go ahead and just take over the web and do whatever they want and quote set up a new separate internet as the former head of the CIA Hayden said over the weekend quote another second internet for government and trusted users to stop hackers.
[00:28:50.405 --> 00:28:52.466]  And the Stuxnet worm, which they admit the U.S.
[00:28:52.466 --> 00:28:53.387]  and Israel launched.
[00:28:53.387 --> 00:29:04.754]  They publicly launch it, admit they launch it tacitly, and then you've got to lose your internet freedom and you've got to be taxed and have an internet ID and go on to this new controlled internet as they shut the old one down because they launched the Stuxnet.
[00:29:04.754 --> 00:29:06.955]  They actually say, we've got to do this because of Stuxnet.
[00:29:06.955 --> 00:29:09.037]  By the way, we launched it.
[00:29:09.037 --> 00:29:10.317]  We shipped the guns in Mexico.
[00:29:10.317 --> 00:29:12.879]  We launched the Stuxnet.
[00:29:12.879 --> 00:29:14.240]  We staged the Gulf of Tonkin.
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:15.741]  Ha ha ha, we'll do whatever we want.
[00:29:16.769 --> 00:29:18.491]  They just caught a CIA guy two months ago.
[00:29:18.491 --> 00:29:28.580]  That's even in Associated Press now, giving radioactive material to the Taliban in Pakistan, trying to get them to blow stuff up, so they could then blame the Pakistani military for it, as a pretext to invade those guys.
[00:29:29.244 --> 00:29:33.926]  But when we come back, I want to get into all the other ways the executive's power-grabbing.
[00:29:33.926 --> 00:29:35.086]  Guns.
[00:29:35.086 --> 00:29:36.967]  Carbon taxes.
[00:29:36.967 --> 00:29:40.689]  Healthcare waivers to companies that are insiders.
[00:29:40.689 --> 00:29:42.690]  The war.
[00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:43.830]  Not consulting Congress.
[00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:44.951]  I mean, are you getting it?
[00:29:44.951 --> 00:29:48.492]  I mean, Congress people are calling this a dictatorship.
[00:29:48.492 --> 00:29:49.633]  That's what it is!
[00:29:49.633 --> 00:29:50.773]  Let's call it what it is!
[00:29:50.773 --> 00:29:52.174]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.174 --> 00:29:54.695]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.695 --> 00:29:57.356]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.336 --> 00:30:04.879]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:30:04.879 --> 00:30:05.800]  Number 1.
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:09.223]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:09.223 --> 00:30:10.083]  Number 2.
[00:30:10.083 --> 00:30:14.987]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:14.987 --> 00:30:15.727]  It's true.
[00:30:15.727 --> 00:30:20.591]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:20.591 --> 00:30:21.432]  Number 3.
[00:30:21.432 --> 00:30:25.014]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:25.014 --> 00:30:28.697]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:30:28.897 --> 00:30:29.697]  Number 4.
[00:30:29.697 --> 00:30:32.458]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:30:32.458 --> 00:30:36.139]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:36.139 --> 00:30:36.919]  Number 5.
[00:30:36.919 --> 00:30:41.080]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:46.122]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:30:46.122 --> 00:30:50.303]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:50.303 --> 00:30:52.084]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:52.084 --> 00:30:56.685]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[00:31:01.467 --> 00:31:05.490]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:08.731]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:31:08.731 --> 00:31:13.514]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:31:13.514 --> 00:31:19.918]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:31:19.918 --> 00:31:22.159]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:31:22.699 --> 00:31:22.999]  Tim Geithner?
[00:31:22.999 --> 00:31:23.499]  Bernanke?
[00:31:23.499 --> 00:31:24.180]  They're arsonists!
[00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:25.460]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:27.701]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:31:41.607 --> 00:31:48.874]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:31:48.874 --> 00:31:58.002]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:05.901]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:05.901 --> 00:32:14.762]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:32:14.762 --> 00:32:19.403]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:32:19.403 --> 00:32:30.205]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:32:30.845 --> 00:32:40.367]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:40.367 --> 00:32:45.789]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:32:45.789 --> 00:32:53.270]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:56.031]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:33:25.484 --> 00:33:36.207]  Even Senator Franken, Congressman Kucinich, they've all come out and said that a dictatorship of the executive is being set up.
[00:33:36.207 --> 00:33:39.788]  Ron Paul called it the last nail in the Republic's coffin.
[00:33:39.788 --> 00:33:46.990]  Congressman Nadler, senior Democrat, said that Obama is becoming a king or emperor.
[00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:53.372]  But again, we've been wrong all these years about dictatorship and martial law being set up.
[00:33:55.134 --> 00:34:02.015]  They're never going to call it dictatorship.
[00:34:02.015 --> 00:34:04.836]  They're never going to call it martial law.
[00:34:04.836 --> 00:34:19.798]  But when the states, and even the Congress, tell the President not to do something, and he goes ahead and does it, and says, I don't need to talk to you, when in the Constitution, the Congress is the boss, they're not co-equal.
[00:34:19.798 --> 00:34:22.439]  That's a more modern propaganda.
[00:34:22.439 --> 00:34:24.359]  And then they've moved to telling you the President's the boss.
[00:34:25.532 --> 00:34:31.115]  If you read the Federalist Papers and other founding debates, it's 100% clear.
[00:34:31.115 --> 00:34:33.737]  Congress is numero uno.
[00:34:33.737 --> 00:34:35.918]  Legislatures are numero uno.
[00:34:35.918 --> 00:34:37.619]  They are the law givers.
[00:34:37.619 --> 00:34:48.425]  Next is the court that checks the law to see that it's constitutional, and next is the minion, and that's the executive.
[00:34:49.266 --> 00:34:54.911]  That's the executive that executes, whether it's the governor or whether it's the president.
[00:34:54.911 --> 00:34:57.713]  Whether it's the mayor, it's the same thing.
[00:34:57.713 --> 00:35:06.740]  Now, if you look at what's going on with Obama and the executive, it's crystal clear.
[00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:08.582]  Congress controls the purse springs.
[00:35:10.816 --> 00:35:14.160]  The power of the purse and the purse strings.
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:23.090]  The Congress levies war, declares war, launches military actions or defense of the border.
[00:35:23.090 --> 00:35:26.774]  And what has Obama been saying in the last year?
[00:35:26.774 --> 00:35:30.539]  He says, I'll launch any war I want and I don't even need to talk to Congress.
[00:35:32.130 --> 00:35:41.960]  He says, I'll set up carbon taxes through the bureaucracy and I don't care if Congress voted down our carbon taxes two years ago and again a year ago.
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:42.821]  I don't care.
[00:35:42.821 --> 00:35:46.164]  I'm going to order the EPA to do it.
[00:35:46.164 --> 00:35:55.994]  I don't care if Congress, and that's actually in these articles, the White House frustrated that Congress won't pass more quote gun control, that is victim disarmament.
[00:35:57.068 --> 00:36:18.230]  Oh, Hitler took the guns, Stalin took the guns, the first gun control laws in this country were enacted after blacks attained their freedom on paper at the end of the Civil War with the Emancipation Proclamation, and the first gun laws were passed from New York State to Kansas to Florida, you name it, that blacks couldn't own guns.
[00:36:19.423 --> 00:36:21.524]  Or that you had to pay a fee to get them.
[00:36:21.524 --> 00:36:23.004]  It varied state to state.
[00:36:23.004 --> 00:36:40.410]  But the point is, the ATF, who had been whiskey regulators, that's why they were so famously corrupt, because they would come shake down your still if you weren't paying taxes on the local whiskey you were making or Moonshine, and they became notoriously corrupt because you could pay them off.
[00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:44.071]  They suddenly started enforcing gun laws.
[00:36:45.763 --> 00:36:52.784]  Oh yes, they weren't even called ATF then, they were called Federal Whiskey Tax Assessors and Enforcers.
[00:36:52.784 --> 00:36:56.725]  The first federal armed agents outside of the U.S.
[00:36:56.725 --> 00:36:57.625]  Cavalry.
[00:36:57.625 --> 00:36:59.966]  And here they come.
[00:36:59.966 --> 00:37:08.067]  And boy, they'd kick down those black people's doors and they'd come in there and they'd find that shotgun and they'd say, boy, you think you're allowed to own a gun?
[00:37:08.067 --> 00:37:11.568]  And that gun butt would go right in those teeth.
[00:37:12.128 --> 00:37:19.497]  You don't have a shotgun to protect yourself from the Ku Klux Klan when they come a-ridin' to shoot up your house and burn it down.
[00:37:19.497 --> 00:37:23.321]  There were cases of black folks gettin' guns, gettin' together, and defending themselves.
[00:37:23.321 --> 00:37:25.344]  You don't do that!
[00:37:25.344 --> 00:37:27.106]  We're gonna take your guns!
[00:37:27.106 --> 00:37:29.749]  Didn't you read the fine print of the law we passed?
[00:37:39.107 --> 00:37:42.670]  This is the type of garbage that we're dealing with and facing.
[00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:52.579]  And so, he says he's coming out with executive orders and other bureaucratic moves, including putting you on a no-gun-by list when you have no criminal record.
[00:37:52.579 --> 00:37:55.961]  That's been their plan for three years, even before they got in office.
[00:37:55.961 --> 00:38:00.185]  Emmanuel said it as a congressman and then as the chief of staff, and now that's what they're saying they're going to do.
[00:38:00.185 --> 00:38:01.406]  And the Huffington Post praises it.
[00:38:01.406 --> 00:38:04.449]  They say, wow, we like this executive power.
[00:38:05.353 --> 00:38:07.615]  We really, really, really like it.
[00:38:07.615 --> 00:38:22.149]  And you notice there's Time Magazine, Newsweek, CNN, all these publications, I covered it a few weeks ago on the 4th of July, demonizing the entire Constitution and saying it's trash, get rid of it.
[00:38:22.149 --> 00:38:22.630]  And they've got
[00:38:25.852 --> 00:38:46.119]  The CNN host, the rest of them, the Council on Foreign Relations coming out against that evil constitution with the right to defend yourself, the right to have private property, that your home is your castle, that no one is above the law, fair weights and measures, no indentured servitude, all these horrible things that they demonize 24-7.
[00:38:49.181 --> 00:38:50.704]  Say what you want about the Founding Fathers.
[00:38:50.704 --> 00:38:52.787]  This was their ideas.
[00:38:52.787 --> 00:38:55.992]  Didn't even mean they implemented it all when they got into power.
[00:38:55.992 --> 00:39:00.861]  The point is, it's the idea that has flowered and that others looked at and picked up.
[00:39:02.591 --> 00:39:08.774]  So continuing here, Obama says he doesn't need Congress to pass cyber security.
[00:39:08.774 --> 00:39:13.076]  He's just implementing the Internet kill switch and takeover system on his own.
[00:39:13.076 --> 00:39:16.177]  The Pentagon now has admitted they've built their own private Internet.
[00:39:16.177 --> 00:39:18.598]  They're going to force you onto where you have no rights.
[00:39:18.598 --> 00:39:24.681]  Associated Press this weekend, as we told you a decade ago, from the Internet to documents that are public, they tell you what they're going to do.
[00:39:24.681 --> 00:39:26.222]  That's what's so frustrating.
[00:39:26.222 --> 00:39:28.803]  Continuing, what did Obama say over the weekend?
[00:39:28.803 --> 00:39:29.924]  But it didn't go over too well.
[00:39:30.664 --> 00:39:31.605]  We covered this yesterday.
[00:39:31.605 --> 00:39:39.270]  He came out and he said, if the states... Well, that goes back to the Civil War.
[00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:52.360]  He said, we will use a clause in the 14th Amendment used against the states and members of the Congress, the Federal Congress from the states, if the Federal Congress does not raise the debt ceiling to the foreign bankers.
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:54.502]  This was in AFP, you name it, yesterday.
[00:39:54.502 --> 00:39:57.204]  I shot videos on it last night and covered it on the radio show.
[00:39:57.924 --> 00:40:20.449]  That if you don't raise the debt ceiling and give more to the bankers that have hijacked the government and have set up this dictatorship of the bureaucracy, with the President now the head criminal publicly, the figurehead, if you don't do that, we will simply use the powers that the President used during Reconstruction.
[00:40:20.449 --> 00:40:21.929]  I guess that'd be Ulysses S. Grant.
[00:40:22.987 --> 00:40:26.911]  We will use those powers and we don't need the Congress.
[00:40:26.911 --> 00:40:31.957]  So he doesn't need the Congress to launch new wars in Libya, even when the Pentagon's own lawyers tell him he does.
[00:40:31.957 --> 00:40:33.318]  Never before done.
[00:40:33.318 --> 00:40:34.139]  He doesn't need...
[00:40:36.547 --> 00:40:41.794]  The Congress now to raise taxes and to get us deeper into debt, according to them.
[00:40:41.794 --> 00:40:43.416]  Of course, the Congress controls the purse strings.
[00:40:43.416 --> 00:40:44.337]  They don't care.
[00:40:44.337 --> 00:40:47.321]  He doesn't need the Congress to pass a law for carbon taxes.
[00:40:47.321 --> 00:40:52.467]  He doesn't need the Congress to pass a law on
[00:40:53.473 --> 00:40:55.254]  Any of these things.
[00:40:55.254 --> 00:40:57.274]  They're just going to do it.
[00:40:57.274 --> 00:40:59.575]  And he doesn't need the states anymore.
[00:40:59.575 --> 00:41:00.736]  Why even have states?
[00:41:00.736 --> 00:41:04.717]  Because he set up the ten governors in the Governor's Council.
[00:41:04.717 --> 00:41:05.637]  Bush started this.
[00:41:05.637 --> 00:41:09.499]  Cheney was the main guy who said he was above the law in a separate branch of government.
[00:41:09.499 --> 00:41:10.059]  I remember that.
[00:41:10.879 --> 00:41:18.444]  A fourth branch of government, he claimed, as an executive, which, of course, the constitutional law scholars, everybody laughed at, but he still operated that way.
[00:41:18.444 --> 00:41:26.030]  This started under Bush, and then Obama signed the order and got it into place, where we don't talk to the 50 governors and the elected legislatures.
[00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:37.258]  No, we now have a 10-governor council that the president picks that are his little lapdogs that sit over each of the 10 FEMA regions set up in 1979 that we told you that's what FEMA was for.
[00:41:37.918 --> 00:41:41.580]  Because it came out in 86 in Rex 84 hearings in Congress.
[00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:47.362]  We played the clips that FEMA was set up to be a martial law takeover system over the states.
[00:41:47.362 --> 00:41:54.105]  And then in 2007, the John Warner Defense Authorization Act openly said, we're setting this up to use the U.S.
[00:41:54.105 --> 00:41:58.307]  military against states if governors or legislatures don't follow orders.
[00:41:58.667 --> 00:42:15.860]  It actually says it and funded the entire Defense Department set up and NORTHCOM, which was already set up but empowered in 2007, to actually be the receivership arm over the states and now they have the 10 FEMA regions with the 10 governors over it.
[00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:16.721]  But wait, there's more!
[00:42:17.754 --> 00:42:32.221]  Now the Feds, writing laws to shut down small farms and ranches, are going to come in with money to buy off the locals and set up the quote, aid agencies as their policies bankrupt you to pose as the good guys and then spy on rural communities.
[00:42:32.221 --> 00:42:36.023]  Get this, you don't believe me, I played Fox News even reporting it.
[00:42:36.023 --> 00:42:38.004]  CNN reported it and said how good it was.
[00:42:38.004 --> 00:42:46.569]  CIA, FBI, Defense Intelligence, Regular Army, Homeland Security, and Viper TSA teams in your cornfields.
[00:42:48.266 --> 00:42:49.386]  Rural councils.
[00:42:49.386 --> 00:42:50.427]  I don't need a Congress.
[00:42:50.427 --> 00:42:53.367]  I don't need states.
[00:42:53.367 --> 00:42:54.327]  Launching wars.
[00:42:54.327 --> 00:42:57.588]  I don't need Congress.
[00:42:57.588 --> 00:42:58.488]  Carbon taxes.
[00:42:58.488 --> 00:43:00.069]  I don't need Congress.
[00:43:00.069 --> 00:43:01.009]  Gun control.
[00:43:01.009 --> 00:43:02.129]  I don't need Congress.
[00:43:02.129 --> 00:43:03.129]  I don't need Congress.
[00:43:03.129 --> 00:43:04.270]  I don't need Congress.
[00:43:04.270 --> 00:43:05.690]  I don't need Congress.
[00:43:05.690 --> 00:43:06.810]  I don't need Congress.
[00:43:06.810 --> 00:43:09.391]  Why have a stinkin' Congress?
[00:43:09.391 --> 00:43:14.352]  If we let this continue, pretty soon it'll be, huh, that Alex Jones claims that we used to have a Congress.
[00:43:15.506 --> 00:43:18.647]  That Alex Jones claims cows were once fed grass.
[00:43:18.647 --> 00:43:22.508]  That Alex Jones claims that women once breastfed their children.
[00:43:22.508 --> 00:43:25.810]  Alex Jones claims that birds once flew.
[00:43:25.810 --> 00:43:28.590]  Alex Jones claims that once we could own guns.
[00:43:28.590 --> 00:43:30.271]  How ridiculous!
[00:43:30.271 --> 00:43:35.633]  Alex Jones claims we once could drive our own cars and they weren't remote controlled and controlled by the NSA and Google.
[00:43:35.633 --> 00:43:40.234]  Oh yeah, Arizona just passed a law to start having the Google cars drive themselves on the road.
[00:43:40.234 --> 00:43:40.995]  There goes your job.
[00:43:42.172 --> 00:43:43.793]  That gives the globalists total control.
[00:43:43.793 --> 00:43:48.955]  Alex Jones claims once the military actually fought wars instead of robots and drones.
[00:43:48.955 --> 00:43:53.238]  See, this is their world where everything is taken over.
[00:43:53.238 --> 00:43:56.439]  Alex Jones claims once women had children vaginally.
[00:43:56.439 --> 00:44:01.642]  Everybody knows that a stork came and cut women open and that they were always born by cesarean section.
[00:44:01.642 --> 00:44:07.084]  Now more than half the children in this country are born by cesarean section and they're now threatening women if they won't have it.
[00:44:07.084 --> 00:44:10.066]  They're taking control of the entire human biological operation.
[00:44:10.606 --> 00:44:13.188]  All right, we're going to a guest here in a moment with some big breaking news.
[00:44:13.188 --> 00:44:15.430]  But I'm going to be covering this more next hour.
[00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:20.194]  We got Dr. Jerome Corsi coming up with the latest on the birth certificate for about 20-30 minutes.
[00:44:20.194 --> 00:44:22.856]  Then I'm getting into this big issue and all the other news.
[00:44:22.856 --> 00:44:25.018]  But it's here.
[00:44:25.018 --> 00:44:27.139]  And they call tyranny liberty.
[00:44:27.139 --> 00:44:33.744]  They're not going to call it martial law or dictatorship of the puppet president under the bankers.
[00:44:33.744 --> 00:44:35.066]  Banker occupation.
[00:44:35.066 --> 00:44:36.307]  Bankster occupation.
[00:44:36.307 --> 00:44:37.848]  They're not going to call it that.
[00:44:39.531 --> 00:44:43.712]  They're gonna call new wars peace actions.
[00:44:43.712 --> 00:44:45.413]  You see, everything's upside down.
[00:44:45.413 --> 00:44:46.553]  Up is down, down is up.
[00:44:46.553 --> 00:44:47.754]  Black is white, white is black.
[00:44:47.754 --> 00:44:50.255]  2 plus 2 equals whatever they say it equals.
[00:44:50.255 --> 00:44:53.396]  And if you say 2 plus 2 equals 4, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[00:44:53.396 --> 00:44:58.137]  If you don't like being groped, they now call you a conspiracy theorist by the TSA.
[00:44:58.137 --> 00:45:00.318]  On record.
[00:45:00.318 --> 00:45:02.399]  You read George Orwell where he's torturing Winston.
[00:45:03.894 --> 00:45:07.860]  O'Brien is the inner party member, and he's torturing him for months.
[00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:10.484]  And he finally says, now what is 2 plus 2 equal?
[00:45:10.484 --> 00:45:12.066]  And he sees 5, 10, 20.
[00:45:12.066 --> 00:45:14.410]  He goes, I don't know, whatever you say.
[00:45:14.410 --> 00:45:15.492]  It's all blurred.
[00:45:15.492 --> 00:45:16.974]  And he can't think anymore.
[00:45:16.974 --> 00:45:18.817]  And he goes, now you're cured.
[00:45:18.817 --> 00:45:19.498]  I'm releasing you.
[00:45:21.431 --> 00:45:27.513]  And Winston's waiting for execution, but he's been released to the Chestnut Cafe to drink synthetic gin.
[00:45:27.513 --> 00:45:31.454]  And he hears propaganda on the news that Big Brothers just won a big victory.
[00:45:31.454 --> 00:45:38.597]  He even guesses what the lies are gonna be, knows it's a lie, but still loves it and accepts it, and can't wait to be killed.
[00:45:38.597 --> 00:45:40.017]  That's how the book ends.
[00:45:40.017 --> 00:45:41.138]  And that's the general public.
[00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:42.741]  They love it.
[00:45:42.741 --> 00:45:43.582]  They love it.
[00:45:43.582 --> 00:45:44.623]  They love it.
[00:45:44.623 --> 00:45:45.865]  They love it.
[00:45:45.865 --> 00:45:46.786]  And they're gonna get it.
[00:45:46.786 --> 00:45:47.547]  Don't worry.
[00:45:47.547 --> 00:45:49.389]  You want to get hurt real bad?
[00:45:49.389 --> 00:45:51.351]  Tyranny is here, and it's growing.
[00:45:51.351 --> 00:45:52.793]  So that's all coming up.
[00:45:52.793 --> 00:45:54.415]  Now, I remember this a few years ago.
[00:45:54.415 --> 00:45:55.696]  In fact, we'll try to search it.
[00:45:55.696 --> 00:45:56.637]  Four or five years ago.
[00:45:57.378 --> 00:46:05.123]  Milwaukee Council proposed martial law, or members of Milwaukee City Council wanted martial law.
[00:46:05.123 --> 00:46:14.529]  And there was all this corruption coming out and so one of them opened their fat mouth about putting the city under martial law in open session that had been discussed behind the scenes.
[00:46:16.144 --> 00:46:22.275]  And they're not supposed to call it that, but they've introduced this idea to all the cities, getting them primed for it and how cute and fun it is.
[00:46:22.275 --> 00:46:29.246]  Globalist sympathizers have been trained to threat fusion centers everywhere for the full takedown of America by the criminals that have hijacked D.C.
[00:46:30.342 --> 00:46:39.630]  Now, we covered last week Jennifer Jones, who runs a local newspaper and court site, where she got up in her three-minute communication.
[00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:45.375]  They didn't want her discussing the fact that they just passed an illegal tax.
[00:46:45.375 --> 00:46:48.237]  And so they ordered the police to arrest her.
[00:46:48.237 --> 00:46:50.319]  And the mayor said she's allowed to speak.
[00:46:50.319 --> 00:46:51.219]  It's her communication.
[00:46:51.219 --> 00:46:52.400]  She's being very polite.
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:54.702]  And they said no and arrested her.
[00:46:54.702 --> 00:46:58.425]  Now, it's confirmed that a SWAT team was sent to the mayor's house.
[00:46:59.346 --> 00:47:02.368]  To take him to a secret meeting.
[00:47:02.368 --> 00:47:06.771]  Jennifer Jones was there and able to eavesdrop through the door on part of it.
[00:47:06.771 --> 00:47:14.816]  The Arizona Central, that's the Arizona Republic, the big paper in Arizona, is reporting court site official rejects mayor's martial law claim.
[00:47:14.816 --> 00:47:22.461]  The mayor says it's martial law and the media is like, ha ha ha, the SWAT team only came and took him.
[00:47:22.461 --> 00:47:25.783]  And so it continues here.
[00:47:27.111 --> 00:47:29.793]  And we're going to go over this.
[00:47:29.793 --> 00:47:33.535]  They had an emergency Sunday session to beef up security.
[00:47:33.535 --> 00:47:37.097]  Now, the police chief said months ago that we can't have citizens criticizing us.
[00:47:37.097 --> 00:47:38.938]  This will cause a Jared Lee Loeffner.
[00:47:38.938 --> 00:47:41.519]  So they're going to use that to fully lock the city down.
[00:47:41.519 --> 00:47:43.380]  There's areas of Arkansas under martial law.
[00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:44.381]  The cops even call it that.
[00:47:45.836 --> 00:47:46.817]  And you found the Milwaukee.
[00:47:46.817 --> 00:47:48.860]  Put that up as we go to Jennifer Jones.
[00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:49.701]  Now there it is.
[00:47:49.701 --> 00:47:51.763]  Unraveling the martial law rumor.
[00:47:51.763 --> 00:47:52.364]  Press buzz.
[00:47:52.364 --> 00:47:54.226]  I remember it was in the Milwaukee News.
[00:47:54.226 --> 00:47:56.869]  It goes to the city council member that talked about it.
[00:47:56.869 --> 00:48:00.513]  Okay, let's go ahead now and go to Jennifer Jones.
[00:48:00.513 --> 00:48:01.955]  Jennifer, we don't have a lot of time.
[00:48:01.955 --> 00:48:02.796]  We appreciate you joining us.
[00:48:02.796 --> 00:48:04.278]  We're trying to get the mayor on soon.
[00:48:04.278 --> 00:48:06.120]  Tell us exactly, in a nutshell, what happened.
[00:48:07.156 --> 00:48:15.261]  Okay, well, here is as quickly as I can do it, because ironically, I'm in my car on my way to jury duty, of all things.
[00:48:15.261 --> 00:48:16.201]  Here's what happened.
[00:48:16.201 --> 00:48:27.508]  Sunday about 11.30 in the morning, the police chief and the sergeant, and the sergeant was in his tactical gear, showed up at the mayor's house and ordered the mayor to get into the police car and go with him to town hall.
[00:48:28.548 --> 00:48:31.350]  Apparently said, uh, Town Hall's not open on Sunday.
[00:48:31.350 --> 00:48:33.651]  I'm not going with you anywhere.
[00:48:33.651 --> 00:48:36.573]  And, uh, if I go to Town Hall, I'll take my own car.
[00:48:36.573 --> 00:48:40.195]  So he started calling several of us and said, grab your cameras and meet me at Town Hall.
[00:48:40.195 --> 00:48:42.376]  There's something terribly wrong.
[00:48:42.376 --> 00:48:45.298]  So we did that and a handful of us went to Town Hall.
[00:48:45.778 --> 00:48:54.485]  And when we got there, I asked the mayor, what did you call dispatch to see if the police chief radioed in this call to dispatch and what this is about?
[00:48:54.485 --> 00:48:55.526]  So he called dispatch.
[00:48:55.526 --> 00:48:56.867]  He asked for the county sheriff.
[00:48:56.867 --> 00:49:03.311]  It said the nearest sheriff is in Ehrenberg about, you know, that's about 17, 19 miles away.
[00:49:03.311 --> 00:49:04.552]  So it'll be a moment.
[00:49:04.552 --> 00:49:08.095]  In the meantime, we'll call two portside police officers who are on duty.
[00:49:08.095 --> 00:49:12.478]  And that was Officer Rodriguez and Officer Norris.
[00:49:12.478 --> 00:49:13.279]  Officer Norris, for
[00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:25.585]  Walk up the steps while we're waiting for the police and they open the door and Sergeant Browstow in his tactical gear opens the door.
[00:49:25.585 --> 00:49:28.748]  You can see this on the video on YouTube.
[00:49:28.748 --> 00:49:32.050]  He opens the door, the mayor says, he asks the mayor if he's coming in.
[00:49:32.050 --> 00:49:40.015]  He looks, we see all the council, town manager, town attorney, town assistant attorney, everyone, town clerk in there looking very nervous.
[00:49:40.015 --> 00:49:42.237]  And he says, I'm not going in there, this is an illegal meeting.
[00:49:42.697 --> 00:49:45.719]  So they locked the door, and they held the meeting.
[00:49:45.719 --> 00:49:48.460]  The mayor got on the phone, started making phone calls.
[00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:52.542]  Local realtor and I took our cameras to the glass and photographed this meeting.
[00:49:52.542 --> 00:50:00.787]  I stuck my ear to the glass, wherein I heard the police chief make about a 20-minute speech about how the town had been flooded with emails since your show.
[00:50:00.787 --> 00:50:11.973]  He blamed it on, I think, the Tea Party is coming to our next council meeting, and it said on this website that Daily Paul and the mayor and Jennifer Jones and Michael Roth
[00:50:12.473 --> 00:50:13.474]  Hold on, hold on, hold on!
[00:50:13.474 --> 00:50:14.294]  For martial law?
[00:50:39.757 --> 00:50:45.762]  Hey Brian, if you could do just one thing today to ensure your family's food security, what would it be?
[00:51:06.917 --> 00:51:07.937]  That's easy, Bill.
[00:51:07.937 --> 00:51:12.059]  I'd head straight to soupbeansurvival.com.
[00:51:12.059 --> 00:51:13.579]  Soupbeansurvival.com?

[00:51:23.743 --> 00:51:24.343]  Really, Brian?

[00:51:26.345 --> 00:51:28.486]  Well, certainly the forgotten survival food.
[00:51:28.486 --> 00:51:29.507]  Absolutely, Bill.
[00:51:29.507 --> 00:51:40.934]  The folks at SoupBeanSurvival.com scoured our planet to find the very best heirloom seeds to truly find nature's super survival food.

[00:51:43.915 --> 00:51:46.597]  You're not going to find these beans in any grocery store.
[00:51:46.597 --> 00:51:50.038]  These are the absolute highest quality beans in the world.

[00:51:59.963 --> 00:52:04.525]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:52:04.525 --> 00:52:05.125]  Number one.
[00:52:05.425 --> 00:52:09.708]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:52:09.708 --> 00:52:14.592]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:52:14.592 --> 00:52:15.352]  It's true.
[00:52:15.352 --> 00:52:21.037]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:52:21.037 --> 00:52:24.639]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:52:24.639 --> 00:52:28.322]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:52:28.522 --> 00:52:29.323]  Number 4.
[00:52:29.323 --> 00:52:32.085]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:52:32.085 --> 00:52:35.767]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:52:35.767 --> 00:52:36.568]  Number 5.
[00:52:36.568 --> 00:52:40.711]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:52:40.711 --> 00:52:45.474]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:54:22.637 --> 00:54:29.622]  We have the draft of the minutes of the secret council meeting and the full thing is going up very, very soon.
[00:54:29.622 --> 00:54:30.982]  The mayor just got it.
[00:54:30.982 --> 00:54:35.806]  The transcript where martial law, civil emergency, was discussed.
[00:54:36.326 --> 00:54:42.771]  Uh, they talked about comments on the YouTube video of Jennifer Jones on this show, uh, last Friday.
[00:54:42.771 --> 00:54:45.813]  They had this emergency meeting, uh, Sunday.
[00:54:45.813 --> 00:54:50.237]  This is now one of the major reports, uh, in the Arizona Republic.
[00:54:50.237 --> 00:54:52.879]  Courtside official rejects mayor's martial law claim.
[00:54:53.819 --> 00:54:56.902]  Now, I want to get back to what you heard with your ear up against the window.
[00:54:56.902 --> 00:54:58.764]  You guys were able to get some audio.
[00:54:58.764 --> 00:55:02.828]  You're trying to boost that audio with the camera mic up to the crack in the door.
[00:55:02.828 --> 00:55:08.673]  It's very hard to hear, but if you just put it raw on the web, folks can grab it, and there's audio experts that know how to separate it out.
[00:55:08.673 --> 00:55:14.118]  But regardless, we now have the agenda, and we're about to get the actual minutes of it.
[00:55:14.118 --> 00:55:17.041]  Now, specifically here, you were telling Rob Due this morning,
[00:55:17.801 --> 00:55:23.964]  And clarify this that they went to the mayor's house with the SWAT team or the people in their tactical gear.
[00:55:23.964 --> 00:55:34.310]  Describe what happened there and what else was said because I'm talking about Obama saying Congress isn't needed for war, gun control, carbon taxes, internet kill switches.
[00:55:34.310 --> 00:55:37.871]  That's the big theme today because it's all coming down right now.
[00:55:37.871 --> 00:55:41.753]  And here's this same attitude in Quartzsite, Arizona.
[00:55:41.753 --> 00:55:42.814]  So tell us what happened with the mayor.
[00:55:43.942 --> 00:55:54.414]  Well, I've been here about over a decade and I've never seen any police officers wearing that sort of tactical gear with the big white police letters on the bulletproof vests and things.
[00:55:54.414 --> 00:55:58.578]  You can see that in the video of the illegal meeting when he opens the door for the mayor.
[00:55:58.578 --> 00:56:00.520]  But apparently they came to the mayor's house
[00:56:01.341 --> 00:56:06.785]  And the police chief and the duty sergeant and the duty sergeant was wearing the tactical gear.
[00:56:06.785 --> 00:56:12.249]  They ordered the mayor to get into their police vehicle and go with them to Town Hall and he refused.
[00:56:12.249 --> 00:56:17.132]  He said, I know Town Hall is open on a Sunday and I'm not going anywhere with you.
[00:56:17.132 --> 00:56:19.653]  If I go to Town Hall, I'll take my own vehicle.
[00:56:19.653 --> 00:56:24.477]  So he immediately started calling a group of us that he could reach in only a few minutes time.
[00:56:24.477 --> 00:56:27.739]  And said, bring your cameras to Town Hall and meet me there.
[00:56:27.739 --> 00:56:30.281]  The police just came to my door and ordered me to Town Hall.
[00:56:31.241 --> 00:56:32.121]  I have no idea what's going on.
[00:56:32.121 --> 00:56:33.382]  I have no idea what's happening.
[00:56:33.382 --> 00:56:39.463]  Now again, ordered the mayor, their supposed boss, and a lot of the cops are good folks and have gone public.
[00:56:39.463 --> 00:56:40.843]  Some of them are getting in trouble.
[00:56:40.843 --> 00:56:43.444]  People at Town Hall that don't agree with this are being fired.
[00:56:43.444 --> 00:56:48.465]  This is lawsuit city here for the type of political discrimination that's going on.
[00:56:48.465 --> 00:56:51.066]  The city needs to apologize and back off now.
[00:56:51.066 --> 00:56:52.246]  I know they're watching.
[00:56:52.246 --> 00:56:55.267]  They need to realize this is not a fight politically.
[00:56:55.267 --> 00:57:00.528]  They're going to win by screaming that, you know, that the Daily Paul and people are terrorists or that we're terrorists.
[00:57:00.948 --> 00:57:09.976]  You know, as the police chief months ago said that you guys, you know, were basically Jared Lee Loeffner for protesting their tax rate hikes.
[00:57:09.976 --> 00:57:14.120]  I mean, they need to learn this is what a free republic is all about.
[00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:17.583]  But I'll go back to what Mayor Nagin just came out in his new book.
[00:57:17.583 --> 00:57:25.551]  It admits now that reportedly Blackwater came day one with guns and said, we're taking over the mayor's office and he had to kick him out.
[00:57:25.851 --> 00:57:28.473]  But the point is, they try this power grab.
[00:57:28.473 --> 00:57:33.318]  This is what happens in third world countries where the police and military just take over.
[00:57:33.318 --> 00:57:36.501]  This is what Caesar did 2,000 years ago.
[00:57:36.501 --> 00:57:38.302]  So the mayor said, I'm not coming with you.
[00:57:38.302 --> 00:57:39.623]  What happened next?
[00:57:39.623 --> 00:57:43.647]  Well, he drove in his own vehicle to Town Hall while he frantically made phone calls.
[00:57:43.647 --> 00:57:46.750]  And we made phone calls and rounded up a half a dozen people.
[00:57:46.750 --> 00:57:51.174]  When we got to Town Hall, we saw that the police were parked behind Town Hall.
[00:57:51.830 --> 00:57:58.734]  And we parked in the front parking lot, and I asked the mayor, I said, did you check with dispatch?
[00:57:58.734 --> 00:58:00.775]  Because dispatch for us runs through the county.
[00:58:00.775 --> 00:58:02.056]  Even town calls run through the county.
[00:58:04.125 --> 00:58:07.006]  Well, they told him he asked for a sheriff.
[00:58:07.006 --> 00:58:09.266]  He was told the sheriff was about 20 minutes out.
[00:58:09.266 --> 00:58:16.768]  He sent two of our Quartzsite police officers, who were fortunately two of the officers who had filed criminal complaints against the chief.
[00:58:16.768 --> 00:58:18.628]  So we were happy to see them on duty.
[00:58:18.628 --> 00:58:20.908]  They showed up first.
[00:58:20.908 --> 00:58:24.509]  Officer Norris was very concerned that her sister was inside the building.
[00:58:24.509 --> 00:58:28.110]  Her sister's the town clerk, because her sister was supposed to be out of town.
[00:58:28.110 --> 00:58:33.611]  And I still don't know yet if her sister was called and ordered back to take the minutes for this meeting.
[00:58:34.011 --> 00:58:37.732]  Alright, stay there, we're doing five more minutes, then Dr. Corsi's coming up.
[00:58:37.732 --> 00:58:44.195]  But there you go, martial law in Arizona.
[00:58:44.195 --> 00:58:48.156]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:50.629 --> 00:58:51.770]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:58:51.770 --> 00:58:58.717]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:58:58.717 --> 00:59:01.279]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:59:01.279 --> 00:59:06.444]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:59:06.644 --> 00:59:09.685]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:59:09.685 --> 00:59:12.006]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:59:12.006 --> 00:59:18.248]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:59:18.248 --> 00:59:21.629]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:59:21.629 --> 00:59:27.411]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:59:27.411 --> 00:59:29.051]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:59:29.051 --> 00:59:30.352]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:59:30.352 --> 00:59:33.032]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:59:33.032 --> 00:59:34.433]  He explains everything you need to know.
[00:59:34.713 --> 00:59:37.234]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:59:37.234 --> 00:59:41.875]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:59:41.875 --> 00:59:44.456]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[00:59:53.559 --> 00:59:55.960]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.960 --> 00:59:58.741]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:10.094]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.094 --> 01:00:11.695]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.695 --> 01:00:13.617]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.617 --> 01:00:17.420]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:21.483]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.433 --> 01:00:27.018]  Okay, we're going to play this clip live on air.
[01:00:27.018 --> 01:00:37.732]  We now have the video shot by one of the compadres of Jennifer Jones, and you can watch it again on the website that's on the video, where the mayor, who the police have ordered,
[01:00:39.093 --> 01:00:40.694]  We're good to go.
[01:00:59.582 --> 01:01:07.165]  And then the great-grandson, you know, decades from now, a hundred years from now, of this police chief can be, you know, the third or fourth king of court site.
[01:01:07.165 --> 01:01:08.685]  And that's how North Korea works.
[01:01:08.685 --> 01:01:10.306]  That's what the Queen of England is.
[01:01:10.306 --> 01:01:15.268]  Pretty soon, they'll be like tabloids worshipping the police chief and, you know, his wife's gowns or something.
[01:01:15.268 --> 01:01:20.089]  I mean, that's what royalty is, is just people that take over and put a crown on and you worship them.
[01:01:20.089 --> 01:01:21.170]  So here's the mayor.
[01:01:23.371 --> 01:01:27.473]  First ordered there, he gets there and doesn't like what's going on, so they slam the door in his face.
[01:01:27.473 --> 01:01:31.415]  This is martial law going on that they've declared in Courtside, Arizona.
[01:01:31.415 --> 01:01:34.657]  Here it is.
[01:01:34.657 --> 01:01:35.657]  Are you coming in?
[01:01:35.657 --> 01:01:36.678]  No, I'm not coming in.
[01:01:36.678 --> 01:01:37.878]  This is an illegal meeting.
[01:01:37.878 --> 01:01:46.003]  It was never announced.
[01:01:46.003 --> 01:01:46.503]  There you go.
[01:01:48.823 --> 01:01:52.306]  And there's Jennifer Jones.
[01:01:52.306 --> 01:01:54.508]  You can see the meeting halls right in there.
[01:01:54.508 --> 01:01:58.292]  She was able to put her ear up there and hear them read the proclamation.
[01:01:58.292 --> 01:02:03.217]  So even the martial law emergency proclamation is secret.
[01:02:03.217 --> 01:02:08.802]  Boy, and now they've told the Arizona Republic this isn't going on.
[01:02:08.802 --> 01:02:12.826]  What's going to now happen that they've gotten the copy of the proclamation, Jennifer?
[01:02:13.882 --> 01:02:17.024]  Well, you know, that's what we're trying to find out.
[01:02:17.024 --> 01:02:35.773]  The proclamation itself we don't believe is legal, but when you're two hours from the Capitol and nobody wants to rush out here in any big hurry, you know, the question that has been a concern for us is, what is the police chief going to think he has the power to do until the real world punches the time clock this morning?
[01:02:37.731 --> 01:02:44.253]  What's wrong, what's wrong with making these council members and the police chief king?
[01:02:44.253 --> 01:02:46.173]  I mean, that's a good system.
[01:02:46.173 --> 01:02:48.494]  I mean, they're talking about getting rid of the Constitution in our media.
[01:02:48.494 --> 01:02:50.135]  I think you're an extremist.
[01:02:50.135 --> 01:02:51.595]  Okay, so I mean, please.
[01:02:51.595 --> 01:02:54.736]  I think it's good they sent police to the mayor's house and ordered him there.
[01:02:54.736 --> 01:02:56.276]  I mean, this is freedom.
[01:02:56.276 --> 01:02:59.857]  And I think you're an extremist, Jennifer Jones, now expanding, listening to the door.
[01:02:59.857 --> 01:03:04.839]  What else did you hear them say about the civil emergency, aka martial law?
[01:03:05.913 --> 01:03:12.663]  Well, you know, they might say extremist, I say patriot, but what I heard them say was the police chief was the only one who addressed the council.
[01:03:12.663 --> 01:03:13.544]  He's our lord.
[01:03:13.544 --> 01:03:20.654]  And he gave about a 20 minute dissertation referring to the video going viral that we saw my arrest.
[01:03:21.475 --> 01:03:27.739]  Referring to statements the mayor made about how the next council meeting was going to be just as exciting.
[01:03:27.739 --> 01:03:40.566]  Referring to myself by name, to the Republican recent committeeman Michael Roth by name, saying that we have created a situation where danger is imminent and it's an emergency situation.
[01:03:40.566 --> 01:03:41.526]  We must do this.
[01:03:41.526 --> 01:03:42.347]  We must do this.
[01:03:42.967 --> 01:03:44.108]  We're good to go.
[01:04:02.043 --> 01:04:03.244]  Well, I agree with that.
[01:04:03.244 --> 01:04:04.684]  I mean, I'm glad.
[01:04:04.684 --> 01:04:13.148]  I mean, look, when they arrest a woman for speaking in three-minute citizen communication with the mayor saying, let her speak, that's freedom.
[01:04:13.148 --> 01:04:17.590]  And again, Jennifer, all of you people that are upset about this ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
[01:04:18.439 --> 01:04:21.201]  Well, you know, here's the thing, Alex.
[01:04:21.201 --> 01:04:29.246]  If they really want to protect public safety, they need to step down and resign immediately because we never had these sorts of public meetings.
[01:04:29.246 --> 01:04:33.569]  We never even had a need for police at the meetings until they started acting beyond the
[01:04:34.443 --> 01:04:44.172]  And let's be clear, they don't want you up there talking about taxes they've passed that, according to you and others, aren't properly passed or legal, and they're there telling you to shut up.
[01:04:44.172 --> 01:04:46.914]  I mean, this is pure tyranny.
[01:04:46.914 --> 01:04:47.635]  Thank you so much.
[01:04:47.635 --> 01:04:51.998]  We'll check in with you and the mayor tomorrow as this develops.
[01:04:51.998 --> 01:04:53.420]  Jennifer, let me say bye to you during the break.
[01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:56.222]  We're going to get that mayor and you on as soon as possible.
[01:04:56.222 --> 01:04:57.023]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:57.023 --> 01:04:58.544]  How dare the mayor not like this?
[01:04:58.544 --> 01:04:59.505]  This is evil.
[01:04:59.505 --> 01:05:00.366]  This is great freedom.
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:02.962]  Hello, this is Steve Schenk.

[01:06:00.387 --> 01:06:04.950]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:06:04.950 --> 01:06:05.850]  Number 1.
[01:06:05.850 --> 01:06:09.293]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:06:09.293 --> 01:06:10.153]  Number 2.
[01:06:10.153 --> 01:06:15.036]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:06:15.036 --> 01:06:15.777]  It's true.
[01:06:15.777 --> 01:06:20.660]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:06:20.660 --> 01:06:21.480]  Number 3.
[01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:25.063]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:06:25.063 --> 01:06:28.765]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:06:28.965 --> 01:06:29.766]  Number 4.
[01:06:29.766 --> 01:06:32.528]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:06:32.528 --> 01:06:36.212]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:06:36.212 --> 01:06:36.993]  Number 5.
[01:06:36.993 --> 01:06:41.156]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:06:41.156 --> 01:06:45.901]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:07:01.294 --> 01:07:02.996]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:07:02.996 --> 01:07:08.322]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:07:08.322 --> 01:07:09.864]  Saving means to make money.
[01:07:09.864 --> 01:07:18.654]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:07:19.375 --> 01:07:26.899]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:07:26.899 --> 01:07:34.904]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:07:34.904 --> 01:07:40.146]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[01:08:05.495 --> 01:08:10.318]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:08:10.318 --> 01:08:11.899]  You want answers?
[01:08:11.899 --> 01:08:13.441]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.441 --> 01:08:17.643]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.643 --> 01:08:22.667]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:22.667 --> 01:08:26.229]  Okay, I haven't gotten into the huge economic news.
[01:08:26.229 --> 01:08:31.013]  No sooner had they gotten the second banker robbery known as a bailout in Greece.
[01:08:32.082 --> 01:08:35.005]  Hundreds of billions of the bankers again on derivatives they created.
[01:08:35.005 --> 01:08:39.069]  We bail them out and then pay interest to them on the money we give them.
[01:08:39.069 --> 01:08:41.012]  Can't make that up.
[01:08:41.012 --> 01:08:48.479]  Good business, if you can get it, if America and the rest of the world's busy watching Dancing with the Stars and the World Cup.
[01:08:48.479 --> 01:08:49.541]  That's all coming up.
[01:08:49.541 --> 01:08:51.403]  Gold, silver exploding in prices.
[01:08:52.853 --> 01:09:05.624]  Also, there is now no doubt, the governor's councils, the rural councils, Obama launching the Libyan war, saying I don't need congressional approval, carbon taxes without congressional rules against our industries,
[01:09:07.645 --> 01:09:16.211]  Now they're announcing he's gonna have executive orders for a no-gun-by list, just like no-fly list, what his former chief of staff called for years ago.
[01:09:16.211 --> 01:09:17.652]  We've played that video here.
[01:09:17.652 --> 01:09:25.677]  We have special reports up that have just gone live at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com on this subject, Obama establishing a dictatorship.
[01:09:25.677 --> 01:09:27.419]  Now, he may leave.
[01:09:27.419 --> 01:09:34.944]  The point is, Ron Paul, Congressman Nadler, a big Democrat, they've all called this tyranny, the last nail in the coffin, Obama's becoming an emperor.
[01:09:35.834 --> 01:09:36.855]  That's what it is.
[01:09:36.855 --> 01:09:42.019]  Now, he may leave office, but the precedent is set for this power grab.
[01:09:42.019 --> 01:09:43.420]  So, it's here.
[01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:43.921]  It's happening.
[01:09:45.131 --> 01:09:45.951]  And it's incredible.
[01:09:45.951 --> 01:09:49.693]  So we're going to be discussing that coming up at the bottom of the hour as well.
[01:09:49.693 --> 01:09:53.094]  Somebody who's written about this for the last six years, he saw it happening under Bush.
[01:09:53.094 --> 01:09:55.775]  People said, oh, Dr. Corsi, the martial law didn't come.
[01:09:55.775 --> 01:10:00.916]  The point is, it's that slow creep, just like the Roman Republic towards absolute tyranny.
[01:10:00.916 --> 01:10:03.517]  But now it's not a creep, it's a gallop.
[01:10:03.517 --> 01:10:08.339]  And even the Pentagon told Obama, you've got to go to Congress for a new war.
[01:10:08.339 --> 01:10:11.520]  Even the Pentagon, that president's never ignored those lawyers.
[01:10:12.930 --> 01:10:18.135]  And there's the headline, Emperor Obama to use war powers against the Congress.
[01:10:18.135 --> 01:10:31.987]  He even threatened over the weekend, 14th Amendment, and said what we used against the South in Reconstruction, when members of the South in Congress wouldn't go for the incredible war reparations on the South,
[01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:33.990]  I think?
[01:10:50.043 --> 01:10:51.024]  I think it couldn't be more dangerous.
[01:10:51.024 --> 01:10:55.426]  This is a power grab at the dictatorship of the presidency unlike anything that's ever happened in our history.
[01:10:55.426 --> 01:10:55.827]  I'm sure
[01:11:19.813 --> 01:11:28.398]  You go back to parallels in, you know, the Civil War with, uh, Abraham Lincoln defending, uh, you know, various rights.
[01:11:28.398 --> 01:11:29.878]  Doctors, speak up for me!
[01:11:29.878 --> 01:11:31.999]  Start over, Dr. Corsi, and then start over.
[01:11:31.999 --> 01:11:34.681]  I think there's a tremendous power grab, Alex.
[01:11:34.681 --> 01:11:38.163]  I think it's one that's unprecedented in American history.
[01:11:38.163 --> 01:11:46.687]  And what you've got, what we should all fear is, like you say, once the power is in the presidency, it's never going to be reversed.
[01:11:46.687 --> 01:11:47.828]  It'll be now, you know,
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:53.322]  George W. Bush had executive orders that extended emergency powers.
[01:11:53.322 --> 01:12:02.305]  Now Barack Obama is extending presidential powers that would normally be emergency powers in situations that are not emergency.
[01:12:02.305 --> 01:12:04.645]  But the crisis is going to continue to develop.
[01:12:04.645 --> 01:12:11.928]  I mean, we're now on the edge of Europe saying that Greece can actually default on some of its debt.
[01:12:13.030 --> 01:12:19.956]  And if Greece starts to default on its debt, the next strategy that's going to be put into place is the United States defaulting on some of our debt.
[01:12:19.956 --> 01:12:28.383]  And we're entering into a Great Depression that I think will make the previous Great Depression of the 30s look mild.
[01:12:28.383 --> 01:12:32.727]  And by the way, you predicted this a decade ago in one of your best-selling books.
[01:12:32.727 --> 01:12:34.448]  You've written so many on the subject.
[01:12:34.448 --> 01:12:39.152]  America for Sale was really about this whole situation developing, and in fact,
[01:12:39.881 --> 01:12:49.505]  I was saying it was inevitable that we were, the globalists were creating this situation on purpose in order to push us into a one world government.
[01:12:49.505 --> 01:12:56.588]  The solution of all this is going to be to destroy the dollar like George Soros has wanted to do for decades.
[01:12:56.588 --> 01:13:03.651]  It's going to be put the International Monetary Fund of the World Bank in control of the world economic situation.
[01:13:04.477 --> 01:13:11.923]  And I continue to say, people have got to read America for sale, because my point there is that this is not a recession or a depression.
[01:13:11.923 --> 01:13:15.025]  This is what globalism looks like.
[01:13:15.025 --> 01:13:16.766]  The jobs are gone.
[01:13:16.766 --> 01:13:26.654]  Structural unemployment in the United States, where cheap labor is exploited, if not in China, then in Indonesia, or whatever part of the world it can be found in.
[01:13:26.654 --> 01:13:31.157]  That's going to be the future, for the foreseeable future, of the world economy.
[01:13:31.926 --> 01:13:37.157]  And the American middle class in the process is going to die out, was intended to die out.
[01:13:38.817 --> 01:13:45.582]  Absolutely, the middle class, the historic enemy of oligarchs and crony capitalists.
[01:13:45.582 --> 01:13:54.688]  I want to get back into that if we have time, but you join us today because there's been a lot of big developments on the whole hunt for the real birth certificate.
[01:13:54.688 --> 01:13:55.228]  Correct.
[01:13:55.228 --> 01:14:01.692]  They originally, of course, said that a receipt was the original, that no bank vault copy existed.
[01:14:01.692 --> 01:14:06.055]  Then, magically, the new one came out that looked like it had been done by a three-year-old.
[01:14:06.055 --> 01:14:06.896]  Where do we stand now?
[01:14:07.276 --> 01:14:09.177]  Well, the evidence is increasing.
[01:14:09.177 --> 01:14:25.103]  In fact, I'm writing a series of stories this week and next week to show that the Obama birth certificate was forged using the Nordyke birth certificate and a couple of others that we now have as templates.
[01:14:25.103 --> 01:14:34.347]  I'm going to be able to show the cut and paste job, how the transformation of the information occurred, lifting the information off existing birth certificates,
[01:14:34.941 --> 01:14:39.526]  Modifying it, cutting and pasting it to put into the Obama birth certificate.
[01:14:39.526 --> 01:14:42.429]  And the forgery is now obvious.
[01:14:42.429 --> 01:14:45.892]  We've had experts at the Adobe software.
[01:14:45.892 --> 01:14:49.756]  Mara Zabest has weighed in.
[01:14:49.756 --> 01:14:51.859]  She supported Doug Boyd's analysis.
[01:14:51.859 --> 01:14:55.222]  He is a typesetter who's owned a scanning company since the 1990s.
[01:14:57.055 --> 01:15:08.951]  The document the White House presented was not a scan of an original document, and I still doubt that there is any original birth certificate of this nature in the Hawaii vault.
[01:15:08.951 --> 01:15:10.914]  I don't think it exists.
[01:15:10.914 --> 01:15:13.958]  I think the PDF electronic file
[01:15:14.853 --> 01:15:17.976]  The White House released was the birth certificate.
[01:15:17.976 --> 01:15:21.338]  That's the file that was used to create the forgery.
[01:15:21.338 --> 01:15:33.288]  And from that file, the copies, the Xerox copies that were handed out at the White House, including the one that supposedly had the seal on it, were printed from that PDF file.
[01:15:33.288 --> 01:15:39.633]  They were not Xeroxed or copied or scanned out of an original in the Hawaii vault.
[01:15:39.633 --> 01:15:40.714]  I don't think it exists.
[01:15:41.425 --> 01:15:50.593]  And if it does, I challenge the Hawaii Department of Health to release the best evidence to document the document itself and submit it to independent forensic examination.
[01:15:50.593 --> 01:15:53.816]  That's never going to happen because the document itself doesn't exist.
[01:15:56.192 --> 01:15:59.334]  Dr. Corsi, we haven't talked in about a month.
[01:15:59.334 --> 01:16:04.358]  Where is the lawsuit for $285 million against Esquire going?
[01:16:04.358 --> 01:16:07.680]  And for those that don't know, recap what Esquire did.
[01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:11.943]  Well, Esquire, once my book was published, Where's the Birth Certificate?
[01:16:11.943 --> 01:16:22.471]  Esquire, within the first hours, came on out and they said, in an article, it did not identify itself as any kind of a spoof or satire.
[01:16:23.146 --> 01:16:32.010]  That Joseph Farah, the publisher of WorldNetDaily, had decided to pull the book because now that the birth certificate had been released, there was no need for the book.
[01:16:32.010 --> 01:16:35.751]  And that it was being reduced to pulp, taken off the shelves.
[01:16:35.751 --> 01:16:38.733]  It just wasn't true.
[01:16:38.733 --> 01:16:40.133]  The book was not pulled.
[01:16:40.133 --> 01:16:42.354]  In fact, it became a New York Times Best Seller.
[01:16:42.354 --> 01:16:47.536]  It looks like we'll sell... We're headed towards 100,000 copies being sold.
[01:16:47.536 --> 01:16:50.838]  The book is sold very strongly since it was in print.
[01:16:51.925 --> 01:16:58.064]  But undoubtedly when they did that and they offered for you to refund the money...
[01:16:58.899 --> 01:17:00.940]  Well it did hurt sales, and in fact
[01:17:28.052 --> 01:17:33.697]  I was on many radio interviews where the radio announcers believed that the Esquire was true.
[01:17:33.697 --> 01:17:39.622]  The interviewers started out by saying, you know, what happened, that Joseph Barrett pulled your book?
[01:17:39.622 --> 01:17:41.283]  I said, no, it didn't happen at all that way.
[01:17:41.283 --> 01:17:43.925]  That was completely an Esquire lie.
[01:17:43.925 --> 01:17:46.687]  And I think it was what the White House had wanted to happen.
[01:17:46.687 --> 01:17:49.590]  This was their plan.
[01:17:49.590 --> 01:17:56.916]  I think, quite frankly, Alex, is that they thought that if, in fact, the White House did the stunt of releasing a birth certificate, I'm quite sure my book
[01:17:57.697 --> 01:18:03.322]  Forced the White House to hand, and caused them to release this forgery.
[01:18:03.322 --> 01:18:05.623]  The book would be pulled.
[01:18:05.623 --> 01:18:11.828]  I think that, and if the book had been published perhaps by a major New York house, maybe the New York house would have pulled the book.
[01:18:11.828 --> 01:18:12.609]  They might have been right.
[01:18:12.609 --> 01:18:15.912]  They might have, their son might have worked at the White House.
[01:18:15.912 --> 01:18:19.915]  But World Net Daily, we've held, we continue to report this story.
[01:18:19.915 --> 01:18:23.097]  The birth certificate is an obvious forgery.
[01:18:23.097 --> 01:18:24.539]  100%, I'm 100% certain it's a forgery.
[01:18:26.952 --> 01:18:35.554]  And now I'm naming the documents that it was forged from, and we will be now naming the various people involved in the forgery.
[01:18:35.554 --> 01:18:47.897]  I'm about to expose the entire network of what's called the OBOT, the Obama Radical Supporters, who have been plaguing the websites, their own websites and all others, trying to cause disruption.
[01:18:49.517 --> 01:19:02.226]  Yeah, if this wasn't true, they wouldn't have been acting so suspicious for three years and Obama spending $2.2 million to block the release of the long form they said didn't exist.
[01:19:02.226 --> 01:19:02.806]  Precisely.
[01:19:02.806 --> 01:19:07.129]  If this document existed, why wasn't it released three years ago?
[01:19:07.129 --> 01:19:10.392]  Why didn't the American people see this right away?
[01:19:10.392 --> 01:19:15.295]  And the evidence is increasing that Obama was not born in Kenya.
[01:19:15.295 --> 01:19:17.977]  I published the Kenyan documents of the Kenyan government
[01:19:18.701 --> 01:19:24.785]  And by the way, it shows the Bush administration was so into this that they were quietly looking into it.
[01:19:24.785 --> 01:19:25.225]  Correct.
[01:19:25.225 --> 01:19:27.926]  And you would think that that would now be big news, but they used the hoax
[01:19:39.093 --> 01:19:42.535]  It's one of the biggest cover-ups in American history.
[01:20:00.816 --> 01:20:07.182]  Hey, Brian, if you could do just one thing today to ensure your family's food security, what would it be?
[01:20:07.182 --> 01:20:08.203]  That's easy, Bill.
[01:20:08.203 --> 01:20:12.348]  I'd head straight to SoupBeanSurvival.com.
[01:20:12.348 --> 01:20:13.849]  SoupBeanSurvival.com?
[01:20:13.849 --> 01:20:23.799]  I know, Bill, it sounds crazy, but this ancient secret has been around for over 8,000 years, and it truly is nature's super survival food.
[01:20:23.999 --> 01:20:24.600]  Really, Brian?
[01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:26.621]  The number one survival food?
[01:20:26.621 --> 01:20:28.743]  Well, certainly the forgotten survival food.
[01:20:28.743 --> 01:20:29.764]  Absolutely, Bill.
[01:20:29.764 --> 01:20:41.192]  The folks at soupbeansurvival.com scoured our planet to find the very best heirloom seeds to truly find nature's super survival food.
[01:20:41.192 --> 01:20:43.094]  Brian, these aren't grocery store beans, are they?
[01:20:43.294 --> 01:20:44.195]  No way, Bill.
[01:20:44.195 --> 01:20:46.857]  You're not going to find these beans in any grocery store.
[01:20:46.857 --> 01:20:50.321]  These are the absolute highest quality beans in the world.
[01:20:50.321 --> 01:20:52.983]  Visit soupbeanssurvival.com.
[01:20:52.983 --> 01:21:00.250]  That's soupbeanssurvival.com for all the information you're going to need for nature's super survival food.
[01:21:00.250 --> 01:21:04.794]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[01:21:04.794 --> 01:21:05.395]  Number one.
[01:21:05.695 --> 01:21:09.578]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:21:09.578 --> 01:21:14.881]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:21:14.881 --> 01:21:15.622]  It's true.
[01:21:15.622 --> 01:21:21.326]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:21:21.326 --> 01:21:24.908]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:21:24.908 --> 01:21:29.611]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:21:29.611 --> 01:21:31.953]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:21:32.353 --> 01:21:40.376]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:21:40.376 --> 01:21:46.039]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:21:46.039 --> 01:21:50.200]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:51.981]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:21:59.944 --> 01:22:06.630]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:22:06.630 --> 01:22:14.737]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:22:14.737 --> 01:22:22.584]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:22:22.904 --> 01:22:27.988]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:22:27.988 --> 01:22:33.211]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:22:33.211 --> 01:22:37.574]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.

[01:23:52.939 --> 01:23:58.383]  www.hardshoot.com www.hardshoot.com
[01:24:00.786 --> 01:24:01.087]  I'm good.
[01:24:03.752 --> 01:24:07.595]  Dr. Corsi is going to be with us for this short segment about 10 minutes into the next segment.
[01:24:07.595 --> 01:24:08.756]  He'll be gone at 40 after.
[01:24:08.756 --> 01:24:14.261]  Then I'm getting into all the economic news that is off the charts important.
[01:24:14.261 --> 01:24:20.826]  I do want to show PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and invite radio listeners to go to Infowars.com.
[01:24:20.826 --> 01:24:32.736]  It is a detailed report that I worked on last night and this morning right through into the show with Paul Joseph Watson titled, Obama is establishing an executive dictatorship with the total proof
[01:24:33.456 --> 01:24:40.992]  War on Libya, gun control, debt ceiling, carbon taxes, Obamacare, Obama's World Council, Obama's...
[01:24:42.352 --> 01:24:45.613]  Council of State Governors, Internet Kill Switch, and more.
[01:24:45.613 --> 01:24:49.214]  This is a super red alert.
[01:24:49.214 --> 01:24:51.235]  We're gonna do a Google bomb right now.
[01:24:51.235 --> 01:24:52.936]  I haven't done this in over a month.
[01:24:52.936 --> 01:24:57.597]  They've set up algorithms where a lot of key terms are hard to search now.
[01:24:57.597 --> 01:24:59.998]  If we do something archaic, it'll go to number one every time.
[01:24:59.998 --> 01:25:08.101]  If we use something big, that's common sense for them to put, and they admit they've done this into their system, they'll try to block us.
[01:25:08.101 --> 01:25:11.902]  Let's search the term Obama dictatorship.
[01:25:12.202 --> 01:25:15.065]  Two words into Google search engine, let's hammer them.
[01:25:15.065 --> 01:25:18.429]  Obama Dictatorship over and over and over again.
[01:25:18.429 --> 01:25:20.872]  Obama Dictatorship.
[01:25:20.872 --> 01:25:22.033]  Obama Dictatorship.
[01:25:25.370 --> 01:25:29.254]  Search is a secondary search term, Obama establishing.
[01:25:29.254 --> 01:25:30.556]  So two search terms.
[01:25:30.556 --> 01:25:35.261]  Obama dictatorships, one, put that in by itself, and then Obama establishing.
[01:25:35.261 --> 01:25:38.685]  And we'll see if they're blocking his name as well, because anything we do goes to number one.
[01:25:38.685 --> 01:25:43.070]  But now, if not, I'm going to come up with an archaic term tomorrow, something that isn't in their lexicon.
[01:25:43.530 --> 01:25:44.870]  Because we've been testing this now.
[01:25:44.870 --> 01:25:46.350]  We were always 100% successful.
[01:25:46.350 --> 01:25:48.191]  Now, if it's a common term, they're blocking it.
[01:25:48.191 --> 01:25:51.571]  Now, this is a short segment, a little bit more time coming up with Dr. Corsi.
[01:25:51.571 --> 01:25:53.992]  Dr. Corsi, you dropped bombshells on me during the break.
[01:25:53.992 --> 01:25:59.033]  I said, man, they were really scared of this, that, you know, he pulled that stunt right as your book came out.
[01:25:59.033 --> 01:26:04.514]  And I said, do you see the whole Bin Laden thing as an opportune way to smokescreen as well?
[01:26:04.514 --> 01:26:10.955]  And you concurred that these were October surprises that they were saving for the election, but had to pull now.
[01:26:10.955 --> 01:26:12.175]  Break it down, Dr. Corsi.
[01:26:12.555 --> 01:26:29.130]  Well, I think the Obama administration had planned that the birth certificate issue would surface just before the election in November 2012, and they'd spring on the public with no time to analyze that the forgery that had already been done was being held for the right time.
[01:26:29.130 --> 01:26:36.416]  And also, the 2nd October surprise I think we forced the Obama administration to use was to kill Osama Bin Laden.
[01:26:37.108 --> 01:26:41.471]  I think they had trapped him and hunted Osama bin Laden down.
[01:26:41.471 --> 01:26:43.693]  They could have killed him any day they wanted.
[01:26:43.693 --> 01:27:04.567]  But instead of having these two big news stories just before the November 2012 election as October surprises to propel Obama into office, my book, Where's the Birth Certificate?, being published was so threatening to the White House that they had to use early these two prepared October surprises.
[01:27:05.296 --> 01:27:06.797]  We forced their hand.
[01:27:06.797 --> 01:27:14.301]  And I've been told that directly, by inside information that leads directly back into the White House.
[01:27:14.301 --> 01:27:19.043]  Dr. Corsi, I know you have a lot of sources inside government and the military.
[01:27:19.043 --> 01:27:23.606]  I know you've worked for the federal government in counter-terrorism.
[01:27:23.606 --> 01:27:26.667]  Let's just say you've got an intelligence-type background.
[01:27:26.667 --> 01:27:27.708]  What is the word?
[01:27:27.708 --> 01:27:31.630]  Because, obviously, you know, they lied about bin Laden fighting back.
[01:27:32.630 --> 01:27:34.211]  They supposedly threw him in the ocean.
[01:27:34.211 --> 01:27:36.913]  They had DNA released before anybody could release it.
[01:27:36.913 --> 01:27:40.435]  They admit they faked the White House Situation Room photo.
[01:27:40.435 --> 01:27:41.596]  That was admitted three days later.
[01:27:41.596 --> 01:27:43.477]  That was totally fake.
[01:27:43.477 --> 01:27:44.698]  The whole thing was a lie.
[01:27:44.698 --> 01:27:46.199]  What is the information you have?
[01:27:46.199 --> 01:27:50.782]  The information I have is that Bin Laden died of kidney failure a long, long time ago.
[01:27:50.782 --> 01:27:54.664]  Well, you know, again, it's going to be very hard to prove any of these things.
[01:27:54.664 --> 01:27:57.266]  I've been focusing 100% on the birth certificate.
[01:27:57.266 --> 01:27:59.827]  I can tell you the birth certificate is a forgery.
[01:27:59.827 --> 01:28:00.548]  It's a fraud.
[01:28:01.300 --> 01:28:04.821]  Uh, that was made up, and I can tell you exactly when it was done.
[01:28:04.821 --> 01:28:08.702]  It was done right after Governor Abercrombie could find nothing.
[01:28:08.702 --> 01:28:11.283]  Yeah, he was in the newspapers saying, I couldn't find anything.
[01:28:11.283 --> 01:28:12.023]  Right.
[01:28:12.023 --> 01:28:19.466]  And when that word came out, and then just before February 24th, I got called by my sources in Hawaii.
[01:28:19.466 --> 01:28:30.349]  Uh, one of the, the moles that we had within the Hawaii Department of Health went in and looked at the logbook, and suddenly, the Obama fake birth certificate had been inserted into the logbook.
[01:28:31.181 --> 01:28:32.341]  So it's a fake document.
[01:28:32.341 --> 01:28:34.842]  It was created as a fake document.
[01:28:34.842 --> 01:28:36.463]  The whole thing is a manipulation.
[01:28:36.463 --> 01:28:38.363]  It's a big, big lie.
[01:28:38.363 --> 01:28:44.265]  The Hawaii Department of Health is still issuing long-form birth certificates to people who want to pay for them.
[01:28:44.265 --> 01:28:55.289]  This whole idea that it was a special permission and the Obama lawyers had to go out to Hawaii and get special dispensation to pick up the birth, that's all nonsense.
[01:28:56.341 --> 01:29:08.568]  Within three weeks before the Obama birth certificate was released, I've got copies in my files of long-form birth certificates that were sent by the Hawaii Department of Health to people who paid $10 fees to get them.
[01:29:08.568 --> 01:29:10.449]  The whole thing is a lie.
[01:29:10.449 --> 01:29:16.131]  And I'm confident now that my book, that Where's the Birth Certificate?, is so threatening to the Obama administration.
[01:29:16.131 --> 01:29:22.235]  The information in it about the Obama lies, about his past and who he is, is an undocumented president.
[01:29:23.143 --> 01:29:29.688]  Absolutely, and the Kenyan government's on record saying somebody stole the records of Obama and Kenya.
[01:29:29.688 --> 01:29:30.289]  Stay there.
[01:29:30.289 --> 01:29:31.790]  A few more key questions.
[01:29:31.790 --> 01:29:33.231]  Donald Trump coming up.
[01:29:51.107 --> 01:29:55.030]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.030 --> 01:30:00.633]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.633 --> 01:30:04.876]  You may be arrested and you're subject to other police action.
[01:30:04.876 --> 01:30:06.137]  Tyranny is here.
[01:30:06.137 --> 01:30:09.879]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:30:09.879 --> 01:30:12.300]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:17.684]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:30:18.144 --> 01:30:24.826]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:30:24.826 --> 01:30:30.789]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:30:30.789 --> 01:30:34.450]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:30:34.970 --> 01:30:39.254]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:30:39.254 --> 01:30:45.219]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:30:45.219 --> 01:30:48.763]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:30:48.763 --> 01:30:50.744]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:30:50.744 --> 01:30:51.865]  It's here.

[01:32:12.787 --> 01:32:14.748]  There's a place down in Tennessee

[01:32:58.181 --> 01:32:59.042]  Others don't.
[01:33:14.090 --> 01:33:17.465]  We got a big report up at InfoWars.com.
[01:33:17.465 --> 01:33:18.349]  Pistoli.
[01:33:18.349 --> 01:33:18.671]  Pistol.
[01:33:19.710 --> 01:33:30.140]  Who's gunning down our Republic with their federal goon squad, the TSA, said last November, then again this April, and then again two weeks ago, that they were not going to grow up children under 12 anymore.
[01:33:30.140 --> 01:33:31.321]  And it's a total lie!
[01:33:31.321 --> 01:33:36.687]  And now all these new videos come out of them doing it, double-searching, crying six-year-old boys.
[01:33:36.687 --> 01:33:39.369]  It's all up at Infowars.com.
[01:33:39.369 --> 01:33:42.933]  He's even lied to Congress and said this isn't going on.
[01:33:42.933 --> 01:33:43.974]  I mean, these people are crazy.
[01:33:44.605 --> 01:33:46.546]  And that they think we're going to just keep buying their lies.
[01:33:46.546 --> 01:33:49.609]  Also, is Obama establishing an executive dictatorship?
[01:33:49.609 --> 01:33:53.151]  That key report, I want to Google search on this.
[01:33:53.151 --> 01:34:01.298]  You put it into, go to Google, you type in Obama dictatorship, the two words separated, and then you put your cursor over it, and you hit enter.
[01:34:01.298 --> 01:34:04.960]  You don't have to retype it in each time, you just keep putting the cursor over it, and put it in about 50 times.
[01:34:06.221 --> 01:34:09.683]  And we've noticed that key big terms, they are blocking.
[01:34:09.683 --> 01:34:10.864]  We'll see if this one blocks.
[01:34:10.864 --> 01:34:14.946]  If not, I'm going to do it tomorrow with an archaic term, because I'm almost sure that's what's happening now.
[01:34:14.946 --> 01:34:17.167]  And if it's archaic, it'll go to number one.
[01:34:17.167 --> 01:34:19.609]  We've done it like 50, 60 times in a row, number one.
[01:34:19.609 --> 01:34:22.790]  They announced they changed their algorithm.
[01:34:22.790 --> 01:34:32.256]  I've been sitting here entering it in before, and you had it flash up and say, please enter the code below to make sure you're not a spam bot, which is what the government admits they do to our sites with their disinfo.
[01:34:32.896 --> 01:34:36.898]  And so we're just hitting him and driving this to number one, Obama dictatorship.
[01:34:36.898 --> 01:34:38.639]  Hit him and hit him hard.
[01:34:38.639 --> 01:34:42.581]  Now, going back to Dr. Corsi, where is this going with Donald Trump?
[01:34:42.581 --> 01:34:53.107]  Because he helped bring it all to a head, got an early copy of your book, you talked to him, some national media made fun of you and said, Dr. Corsi claims Donald Trump's talk to him.
[01:34:53.107 --> 01:34:58.950]  I mean, like, oh, you could never talk to the great God himself.
[01:34:58.950 --> 01:35:00.911]  Trying to, again, impugn.
[01:35:00.911 --> 01:35:02.132]  Just totally ridiculous.
[01:35:02.881 --> 01:35:08.046]  Well, Donald Trump called me a number of times and he was always pumping for information.
[01:35:08.046 --> 01:35:11.690]  I'm convinced Donald Trump was working with Barack Obama.
[01:35:11.690 --> 01:35:13.712]  But this is all about money, Alex.
[01:35:13.712 --> 01:35:22.740]  By the way, you predicted he would magically get the authorization from their man in Chicago, in Chicagoland, Rahm Emanuel, and magically he's getting the casinos now.
[01:35:22.740 --> 01:35:23.982]  That's what it was all about.
[01:35:23.982 --> 01:35:26.324]  It was about that and also getting a big payday.
[01:35:27.139 --> 01:35:28.140]  From GE.
[01:35:28.140 --> 01:35:34.945]  Remember, GE still owns about 48% of NBC, along with Comcast.
[01:35:34.945 --> 01:35:38.347]  And GE, of course, sits about Obama's right-hand side.
[01:35:38.347 --> 01:35:40.368]  WNBC!
[01:35:40.368 --> 01:35:44.952]  And NBC extended Trump's contract for two years with The Apprentice.
[01:35:44.952 --> 01:35:47.914]  I think that was worth $100 million to Trump.
[01:35:47.914 --> 01:35:49.975]  And now he's getting the casinos.
[01:35:49.975 --> 01:35:52.297]  So Trump came out and said, I want to see the birth certificate.
[01:35:52.297 --> 01:35:53.898]  And then, of course, when Obama released
[01:35:54.443 --> 01:36:00.949]  This fraudulent forged birth certificate, on April 27th, Donald Trump said, well that's good enough for me.
[01:36:00.949 --> 01:36:09.776]  And I told Donald Trump, he called me after that, and he said again, Trump repeated that he thought that the birth certificate was a forged document.
[01:36:09.776 --> 01:36:13.819]  Told me that twice in phone calls after April 27th.
[01:36:13.819 --> 01:36:19.964]  That his golf course designer, a computer expert, had called Trump and said the document's an obvious forgery.
[01:36:19.964 --> 01:36:21.546]  And I said to Trump, if you believe that,
[01:36:31.414 --> 01:36:47.426]  Well, again, for their scripting, they had to build it to a crescendo, then have him act like he was discredited, he creeps off right as your book comes out, and then as folks start looking at that, boom, out pops the bin Laden, all scripted, admittedly all lies, we just don't know what the truth is.
[01:36:48.286 --> 01:36:52.871]  I mean, this is so incredibly obvious that they are scared to death of what's in your book.
[01:36:52.871 --> 01:36:55.233]  By the way, we have it discounted.
[01:36:55.233 --> 01:36:56.274]  Excellent book.
[01:36:56.274 --> 01:36:59.697]  You'll learn so much more in the book, and they want to defeat it.
[01:36:59.697 --> 01:37:01.759]  Of course, he's had other books that sell half a million copies.
[01:37:01.759 --> 01:37:02.420]  This one only 100,000.
[01:37:02.420 --> 01:37:05.383]  That makes it a New York Times bestseller, obviously.
[01:37:05.743 --> 01:37:06.084]  We need to
[01:37:24.465 --> 01:37:25.486]  Well, I'm starting to now.
[01:37:25.486 --> 01:37:30.430]  Probably tomorrow on World Net Daily, the Nordyke Twins document was the major template used to create the forgery.
[01:37:54.173 --> 01:37:58.917]  I'm not going to stop on this at all until we expose the truth.
[01:37:58.917 --> 01:38:01.619]  That's the greatest cover-up in American history.
[01:38:01.619 --> 01:38:04.180]  We've now got a felony committed in the White House.
[01:38:04.180 --> 01:38:08.543]  Forged document that Obama is himself responsible for.
[01:38:08.543 --> 01:38:12.787]  Part of the chain of evidence in order to stay in power.
[01:38:12.787 --> 01:38:17.910]  All the staged manipulation of the news to try to defeat my book, Where's the Birth Certificate?
[01:38:17.910 --> 01:38:19.151]  Prevent it from being read.
[01:38:19.151 --> 01:38:20.732]  Prevent Americans from knowing the truth.
[01:38:20.732 --> 01:38:23.114]  Which is that Obama is not eligible to be President.
[01:38:25.492 --> 01:38:34.059]  Well, in closing, we wish you Godspeed, and obviously as this begins to develop in the next week or so, we want to have you back up just in the next few days.
[01:38:34.059 --> 01:38:40.163]  As soon as you're ready, please have your assistant email us, and we'll schedule in just a 15-minute pop-in, because I know you're busy.
[01:38:40.163 --> 01:38:43.326]  The final question is on another subject, but it goes to credibility.
[01:38:43.846 --> 01:38:59.754]  If I'm a prosecutor, and I've got a convicted liar up on the stand, who I believe committed the new crime, I'm going to bring up the fact that they've been caught lying over and over again, and Obama has made Richard Nixon look truthful, Bill Clinton look like a choir boy.
[01:38:59.754 --> 01:39:09.539]  I mean, there's no doubt this is a new level of deception and lies, where it's just an ocean of lies, where the truth is not there, so it's hard to even get a frame of reference.
[01:39:10.459 --> 01:39:17.682]  Attorney General Eric Holder has now come out, and even the Associated Press of all places, but isn't getting the attention it needs.
[01:39:17.682 --> 01:39:19.703]  I wanted you to briefly speak to this.
[01:39:19.703 --> 01:39:24.045]  That the FBI, the DEA, not just the ATF were involved in Fast and Furious.
[01:39:24.045 --> 01:39:26.126]  That it was tens of thousands of firearms, not 1,800.
[01:39:26.126 --> 01:39:29.888]  That it has been used to kill cops and other people.
[01:39:30.188 --> 01:39:43.837]  And then it was going to be used, as they were already doing a year ago, before this was known, to demonize the Second Amendment, right as he now announces his new no-fly-no-buy type deal to restrict firearm ownership in America.
[01:39:43.837 --> 01:39:49.320]  And so you have an administration constantly engaged in perjury.
[01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:55.004]  What's your take on how big this is, to have this going all the way to the Attorney General and his own rats?
[01:39:55.604 --> 01:40:03.629]  It's huge and it goes right to the Oval Office.
[01:40:03.629 --> 01:40:14.036]  This whole fast and furious, as well as the forging of the birth certificate, is Obama's doing.
[01:40:14.036 --> 01:40:22.001]  And I'm now convinced he'll be able to disclose, probably next week, that a White House unit has been responsible for the OBOT.
[01:40:22.001 --> 01:40:24.843]  The White House has coordinated this attack against the birthers.
[01:40:25.580 --> 01:40:35.309]  The entire thing is misinformation that would be classically KGB, almost as if Obama's entire life and career is an intelligence operation.
[01:40:36.078 --> 01:40:39.160]  Yeah, the misinformation and peruse from my father is where it begins.
[01:40:39.160 --> 01:40:40.941]  It's filled with lies.
[01:40:40.941 --> 01:40:42.643]  I expose that and where's the birth certificate?
[01:40:42.643 --> 01:40:46.005]  Well, that's what all the CIA people and NSA folks I've had on.
[01:40:46.005 --> 01:40:50.588]  They say when you look at Obama, it's all a fake history going back decades.
[01:40:50.588 --> 01:40:57.193]  Clearly, and the whole family's in different intelligence agencies, that this guy is a purely manufactured creature.
[01:40:57.193 --> 01:40:58.714]  The question is, who does he work for?
[01:40:58.714 --> 01:41:00.875]  Well, and why can't we get the documents?
[01:41:00.875 --> 01:41:04.658]  Why can't we get the travel record, the passport record, the school record?
[01:41:05.439 --> 01:41:11.943]  Obama is an undocumented worker in the White House, and that's a classic intelligence cover-up.
[01:41:11.943 --> 01:41:14.724]  What I pointed out is now the cover-up is continuing.
[01:41:14.724 --> 01:41:17.526]  They're forging birth certificate documents.
[01:41:17.526 --> 01:41:21.188]  They're lying about their role, the Fast and Furious.
[01:41:21.188 --> 01:41:32.895]  The entire Obama administration is a liar, and I don't intend to stop Alex until we expose fully who's responsible for creating this forged birth certificate, and the responsibility lies in the Oval Office.
[01:41:36.397 --> 01:41:47.920]  Well, Dr. Corsi, in conclusion here, do you agree historically in looking at this that this makes the administration even more dangerous?
[01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:51.101]  That they're being opposed on their Libya war for constitutional reasons?
[01:41:51.101 --> 01:41:59.783]  Yes, and Alex, we'll be able to announce that I'm working with a group of military that are about to call for a congressional investigation.
[01:41:59.783 --> 01:42:04.744]  The Obama White House should be very concerned about how far they're pushing our U.S.
[01:42:04.744 --> 01:42:05.244]  military.
[01:42:06.209 --> 01:42:06.549]  I don't know.
[01:42:22.461 --> 01:42:23.822]  They're coming very quickly.
[01:42:23.822 --> 01:42:25.142]  It's organizing right now.
[01:42:25.142 --> 01:42:35.686]  But more than that, his frontal assault on the Constitution, saying he doesn't need Congress for taxes, on debt ceiling, he doesn't need them for gun control, he doesn't need Congress for new wars.
[01:42:35.686 --> 01:42:38.087]  I mean, this is off the charts.
[01:42:38.087 --> 01:42:42.448]  I've never seen anything move this fast, and I see that as a sign of desperation.
[01:42:42.448 --> 01:42:44.729]  It is, and the mainstream media won't report it.
[01:42:44.729 --> 01:42:48.451]  The American people, I think, are fed up with the mainstream media.
[01:42:48.451 --> 01:42:50.171]  It's shows like yours, Alex.
[01:42:50.171 --> 01:42:52.092]  It's the work we're doing at World Net Daily.
[01:42:52.873 --> 01:42:56.816]  This is where the real reporting is going on and where the real truth is being told.
[01:42:56.816 --> 01:43:00.739]  Our Constitution has never been in more danger than it is today.
[01:43:00.739 --> 01:43:03.221]  Alright, Dr. Corsi, where's the birth certificate?
[01:43:03.221 --> 01:43:04.502]  Available at InfoWars.com.
[01:43:04.502 --> 01:43:05.523]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:43:05.523 --> 01:43:06.844]  Great pleasure always, Alex.
[01:43:06.844 --> 01:43:07.324]  Thank you.
[01:43:07.324 --> 01:43:08.565]  Alright, thank you.
[01:43:08.565 --> 01:43:11.047]  Folks, I'm telling you, we're in grave danger.
[01:43:11.047 --> 01:43:15.771]  I told you three and a half months ago when they had Al Qaeda start attacking Qaddafi
[01:43:16.371 --> 01:43:25.760]  That's on record now that they would either force him to strike Europe back, and they would call that terrorism, and then use that to take our liberties, or they would stage something.
[01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:29.123]  And now Qaddafi is saying, I'm going to attack Europe.
[01:43:29.123 --> 01:43:31.705]  If you don't stop attacking me, he's played right into their hands.
[01:43:32.786 --> 01:43:36.110]  And they meant he'll do something, they'll stage something.
[01:43:36.110 --> 01:43:45.561]  Got all these White House advisers saying a terror attack would sure help us on record and we want a domestic attack to blame it on Glenn Beck and Alex Jones.
[01:43:45.561 --> 01:43:46.862]  I mean, even Glenn Beck covered that.
[01:43:47.765 --> 01:43:50.867]  He said he's going to be blamed for the new Oklahoma City.
[01:43:50.867 --> 01:43:58.992]  No, if you read all those thinly veiled threats and media matters and it's Glenn Beck and Alex Jones are going to cause the next attack.
[01:43:58.992 --> 01:44:03.135]  And then the very advisors are saying, gee, a new attack would sure help us.
[01:44:03.135 --> 01:44:04.135]  You got those two things.
[01:44:04.135 --> 01:44:06.377]  I mean, they think we're so stupid.
[01:44:07.076 --> 01:44:09.579]  You think it's fun to be on the White House enemies list?
[01:44:09.579 --> 01:44:16.847]  You think it's fun to have them trying to set us up for a new OKC?
[01:44:16.847 --> 01:44:20.511]  But it's because what we're doing is defending the Republic.
[01:44:20.511 --> 01:44:22.973]  If you let criminals run things, folks, the sky's the limit.
[01:44:22.973 --> 01:44:24.876]  They're not going to stop.
[01:44:24.876 --> 01:44:24.996]  OK.
[01:44:26.485 --> 01:44:31.507]  Okay, I want to get into the economic news, then I'm going to get into the whole martial law situation.
[01:44:31.507 --> 01:44:34.368]  And that's what we're creeping into.
[01:44:34.368 --> 01:44:36.849]  Now, actually, jogging into.
[01:44:36.849 --> 01:44:39.470]  And the good news is, but again, they play possum a lot.
[01:44:39.470 --> 01:44:41.331]  It's a psychological warfare tactic.
[01:44:41.331 --> 01:44:47.173]  The White House announced today, okay, they won't try the civil war powers of Reconstruction against the Federal Congress.
[01:44:47.813 --> 01:44:53.355]  Because so many scholars laughed it out, didn't pass the laugh test, that it was just so brazen.
[01:44:53.355 --> 01:44:55.176]  Oh, I don't need Congress for spending now.
[01:44:55.176 --> 01:44:57.297]  I'm the president.
[01:44:57.297 --> 01:45:00.078]  Ulysses S. Grant did it.
[01:45:00.078 --> 01:45:03.040]  By the way, Lincoln wouldn't do that.
[01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:04.780]  He wanted to be friends with the South.
[01:45:04.780 --> 01:45:09.642]  He wanted to not have a brutal reconstruction and a Versailles Treaty-style raping.
[01:45:09.642 --> 01:45:15.205]  And to have Obama say, I'll just use civil war powers on the federal Congress.
[01:45:15.205 --> 01:45:15.465]  What?
[01:45:16.821 --> 01:45:29.211]  He's like, I don't need you for war, I don't need you for taxes, I don't need you for kill switches, I don't need you for gun control, I don't need you for carbon taxes, I don't need you for governor's councils, I don't need you for rural councils, I'll do whatever I want!
[01:45:29.211 --> 01:45:32.253]  I mean, it's so naked!
[01:45:32.253 --> 01:45:37.358]  As Ron Paul said a month ago, this is the last nail in the Republic, this war stuff!
[01:45:38.078 --> 01:45:41.380]  Going to war without telling Congress, I don't even want your support.
[01:45:41.380 --> 01:45:42.880]  Congress is like, here, we'll give it to you.
[01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:43.821]  No!
[01:45:43.821 --> 01:45:44.861]  I want to set the precedent.
[01:45:44.861 --> 01:45:59.249]  It's like when he sat, violating Article 1, Section 9, when he sat, sat on the rotating council as the head of the UN Security Council, that's why they had all the UN officials there.
[01:45:59.249 --> 01:46:01.250]  Henry Kissinger was almost crying.
[01:46:01.250 --> 01:46:02.850]  This was such high treason.
[01:46:02.850 --> 01:46:05.892]  The President serving as the head of the UN at the same time.
[01:46:08.029 --> 01:46:10.190]  That's in my film, Fall of the Republic.
[01:46:10.190 --> 01:46:11.932]  All right, I'm gonna get into all of it.
[01:46:11.932 --> 01:46:16.735]  Getting into economic news here, again, it's off the charts.
[01:46:16.735 --> 01:46:19.777]  Obama's saying they're gonna go ahead with a debt increase regardless.
[01:46:19.777 --> 01:46:22.259]  World stocks down, a renewed EU, debt concerns.
[01:46:22.259 --> 01:46:24.841]  Of course, as soon as they further bankrupt Greece.
[01:46:24.841 --> 01:46:26.322]  Now they're moving on to Italy and Portugal.
[01:46:26.322 --> 01:46:27.903]  It was always designed that way.
[01:46:27.903 --> 01:46:35.308]  And then you'll get more trillions of our money, and then it'll just keep dominoing right towards the rest of Europe, England, the United States.
[01:46:36.960 --> 01:46:41.686]  Geithner says hard times to continue for many.
[01:46:41.686 --> 01:46:43.387]  And he says some of the hardest times...
[01:46:44.983 --> 01:46:53.845]  On Meet the Press yesterday, WNBC, Geithner tells NBC's Meet the Press that it's a very tough economy.
[01:46:53.845 --> 01:47:01.447]  He says that for a lot of people it's going to, quote, feel very bad, harder than anything they've experienced in their lifetime now, for a long time to come.
[01:47:01.447 --> 01:47:02.768]  There goes your Hope and James.
[01:47:02.768 --> 01:47:04.788]  This is going to be the worst thing in your lifetime!
[01:47:04.788 --> 01:47:05.288]  Woohoo!
[01:47:05.288 --> 01:47:06.309]  It's a recovery!
[01:47:06.309 --> 01:47:06.609]  Woohoo!
[01:47:10.387 --> 01:47:13.488]  They always say, give us more, more, more, more, we'll fix it.
[01:47:13.488 --> 01:47:16.229]  And they tell Ireland, oh, you're getting into the EU.
[01:47:16.229 --> 01:47:18.150]  You're showing everyone, that's why you've done so good.
[01:47:18.150 --> 01:47:20.271]  One month after they enter, they're totally imploded.
[01:47:20.271 --> 01:47:22.892]  From inside, by design, they don't even owe the money.
[01:47:22.892 --> 01:47:26.133]  Canada's told, you go along with globalism, that's why you're doing better than America.
[01:47:26.133 --> 01:47:28.274]  And then finally, they'll implode them last.
[01:47:28.274 --> 01:47:30.435]  Canada will be the last to fall.
[01:47:30.435 --> 01:47:32.456]  I mean, because it already fell to them.
[01:47:32.456 --> 01:47:35.937]  But they're going to suck and shear the sheep down to the bone.
[01:47:37.683 --> 01:47:40.265]  And I mean, I've got the news here.
[01:47:40.265 --> 01:47:43.068]  It is just absolute total bedlam.
[01:47:43.068 --> 01:47:47.532]  Energy bills to double in five years as customers already hit by 30% increase.
[01:47:47.532 --> 01:47:49.394]  Carbon taxes in England.
[01:47:49.394 --> 01:47:50.154]  Oh, yeah.
[01:47:50.154 --> 01:47:52.877]  Same thing just happened in California.
[01:47:52.877 --> 01:47:56.360]  Exclusive EU calls emergency meeting as crisis stalks Italy.
[01:47:56.360 --> 01:47:56.900]  Stalks it.
[01:47:56.900 --> 01:47:58.682]  The bankers are stalking it.
[01:47:58.682 --> 01:48:00.604]  Australia attacks nation's worst polluters.
[01:48:00.604 --> 01:48:00.764]  Yeah.
[01:48:02.173 --> 01:48:03.534]  It's all coming down.
[01:48:03.534 --> 01:48:05.295]  Gold's set to rise as Italy falls.
[01:48:05.295 --> 01:48:07.597]  Curt Nemo, Infowars.com.
[01:48:07.597 --> 01:48:13.522]  I bring you Ted Anderson, 30-plus years in gold and silver brokerage, the owner of this network and the best place to get gold and silver.
[01:48:13.522 --> 01:48:15.163]  It's where I buy mine.
[01:48:15.163 --> 01:48:20.967]  Ladies and gentlemen, gold's up almost, what, 400-plus percent, silver 700 percent in the last 11 years.
[01:48:20.967 --> 01:48:23.669]  Ted bought it months ago when they did that technical drive-down.
[01:48:23.669 --> 01:48:27.752]  He'll sell it to you at the old price, even though now that it's gone up.
[01:48:27.752 --> 01:48:30.875]  Ted Anderson, what do you make of all this news that's happening right now?
[01:48:31.411 --> 01:48:39.078]  Well, first of all, unemployment figures came out, you know, 18,000 new jobs were put in when there was supposed to be 105,000 projected.
[01:48:39.078 --> 01:48:47.666]  I mean, the Bank of America Corp is going down, JP Morgan is going down because of this debt crisis in Italy and Greece.
[01:48:47.666 --> 01:48:50.849]  I mean, there's just so much going on, Alex, it just makes your mind boggle.
[01:48:51.229 --> 01:49:03.374]  I mean, on July 11th, we're supposed to be sitting at a bear market, not a bull market, and we've seen gold hit just $1.80 less than its market peak this spring.
[01:49:03.374 --> 01:49:05.915]  I mean, silver hit a high today of $37.04, gold hit a high today of $15.58.
[01:49:05.915 --> 01:49:08.116]  Economically, it's like the whole world is falling apart, and there's just
[01:49:15.259 --> 01:49:17.581]  Bad policy after bad policy.
[01:49:17.581 --> 01:49:24.005]  I mean, President Obama's saying that we should raise the debt limit so we can shore up our economy.
[01:49:24.005 --> 01:49:27.368]  How do you shore up your economy by going further into debt?
[01:49:27.368 --> 01:49:29.489]  It absolutely makes no sense.
[01:49:29.489 --> 01:49:33.492]  Everything's twisted backwards, upside down, and moving in reverse.
[01:49:33.492 --> 01:49:35.233]  It just doesn't make sense.
[01:49:35.233 --> 01:49:41.238]  Alex, the only thing that makes sense is to pick up that video series that you threw in front of me, that American Dream.
[01:49:41.798 --> 01:49:50.267]  I mean, that thing is, it's an animation, and you can clearly see what's going on with this banking elite thing.
[01:49:50.267 --> 01:49:54.492]  You know, the only thing I can say that's better than this are your videos.
[01:49:54.492 --> 01:49:58.135]  And so right now, you can still pick up two silver dollars.
[01:49:58.135 --> 01:50:02.300]  I don't know why anybody wouldn't want to take advantage of this deal, because you'll need these silver dollars.
[01:50:03.441 --> 01:50:10.444]  For $75 you get the American Dream video and you also get Mark Dice's book, you know, the Big Brother book.
[01:50:10.444 --> 01:50:15.907]  I mean, you're saving about $45 on the books and the videos and you're getting the silver dollars.
[01:50:15.907 --> 01:50:18.869]  Literally, I can't even sell the silver dollars at this price anymore.
[01:50:19.369 --> 01:50:20.649]  That's, that's, that's the offer.
[01:50:38.346 --> 01:50:46.993]  And Ted has got a deal where you can get the American Dream DVD on the Banksters animated special, along with Mark Dice's book.
[01:50:46.993 --> 01:50:52.018]  You buy the two silver dollars at cost and he throws in the book and the DVD on top of it.
[01:50:52.018 --> 01:50:53.359]  That is, what, a $40 discount?
[01:50:55.060 --> 01:50:56.241]  So again, it's available 800-686-2237.
[01:50:56.241 --> 01:51:00.946]  We'll be right back with Ted Anderson.
[01:51:00.946 --> 01:51:02.187]  You've been lied to.
[01:51:02.187 --> 01:51:07.472]  Lied to by the Wall Street propaganda machine, the government, and the talking heads in the media.
[01:51:07.472 --> 01:51:09.353]  The market is in for another crash.
[01:51:09.353 --> 01:51:11.756]  Real estate is already in a double-dip recession.
[01:51:11.756 --> 01:51:14.939]  And if you want to keep your hard-earned money safe, this message is for you.
[01:51:15.459 --> 01:51:21.487]  My name is Brett Kitchen, and after losing 35% of my money when the market crashed, I said enough is enough.
[01:51:21.487 --> 01:51:30.158]  I searched and discovered a way to safely grow my money, participate in potential double-digit gains, but also have my money protected when the crashes come.
[01:51:30.158 --> 01:51:32.601]  Plus, it could save you thousands in taxes.
[01:51:33.081 --> 01:51:42.905]  I want you to get a free copy of my new book, Safe Money Millionaire, where I share this powerful tool that people like Walt Disney and JCPenney used to safely grow their wealth.
[01:51:42.905 --> 01:51:44.185]  Call 1-800-675-1640 right now to get your free copy.
[01:51:44.185 --> 01:51:44.905]  Again, that's 1-800-675-1640.
[01:51:44.905 --> 01:51:47.526]  I'm giving away a limited number of copies today, so call 1-800-675-1640.
[01:52:01.767 --> 01:52:05.791]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:52:05.791 --> 01:52:09.034]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:52:09.034 --> 01:52:13.838]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:52:13.838 --> 01:52:20.224]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:52:20.224 --> 01:52:22.467]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:52:23.027 --> 01:52:24.608]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:52:24.608 --> 01:52:25.768]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:52:25.768 --> 01:52:28.009]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:52:41.894 --> 01:52:46.276]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[01:52:46.276 --> 01:52:49.177]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:52:49.177 --> 01:52:58.360]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv

[01:54:11.570 --> 01:54:16.311]  There's a man going around taking names.
[01:54:16.311 --> 01:54:21.933]  And he decides who to free and who to blame.
[01:54:21.933 --> 01:54:24.674]  Everybody won't be treated all the same.
[01:54:24.674 --> 01:54:26.594]  There'll be a golden ladder.
[01:54:26.594 --> 01:54:29.815]  There'll be a golden ladder reaching down.
[01:54:29.815 --> 01:54:32.156]  When the man comes around.
[01:54:32.156 --> 01:54:34.976]  When the man comes around.
[01:54:34.976 --> 01:54:36.077]  For all the criminals.
[01:54:37.128 --> 01:54:39.269]  All right, going back to Ted Anderson.
[01:54:39.269 --> 01:54:44.532]  We do have a video Skype interview for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and listeners.
[01:54:44.532 --> 01:54:49.775]  You'll get to hear Stefan Molyneux joining us, who will cover a host of issues with him.
[01:54:49.775 --> 01:54:51.896]  And open the phones up in the last 30 minutes with him.
[01:54:51.896 --> 01:54:54.817]  Obama is establishing an executive dictatorship.
[01:54:54.817 --> 01:54:57.238]  I'm coming to that in just a moment.
[01:54:57.238 --> 01:54:58.479]  And those aren't just words.
[01:54:58.479 --> 01:55:02.461]  This is really happening by not even stealth anymore.
[01:55:02.461 --> 01:55:03.942]  They're just doing it out in the open.
[01:55:04.895 --> 01:55:09.277]  That it's extremely, extremely dangerous.
[01:55:09.277 --> 01:55:22.543]  But going back to Ted Anderson, Ted, and we've got links to it up on Infowars.com, Geithner, quote, for a lot of people, it's going to feel very hard, harder than anything you've experienced in their lifetime now, for a long time now.
[01:55:22.543 --> 01:55:29.887]  So the bankers have gotten their tens of trillions, they've now bankrupted Greece, Ireland, they're now moving into the continent, they'll hold
[01:55:30.507 --> 01:55:34.992]  The next group of nations hostage saying give us trillions more or the whole thing will implode.
[01:55:34.992 --> 01:55:37.935]  They give them trillions more, the next group is imploded.
[01:55:37.935 --> 01:55:39.557]  It's in the IMF World Bank documents.
[01:55:39.557 --> 01:55:41.099]  It's always been the plan.
[01:55:41.099 --> 01:55:44.403]  I've been covering this, specifically what they would do for 12 years.
[01:55:44.403 --> 01:55:45.804]  I mean, it's all a program.
[01:55:45.804 --> 01:55:46.785]  It's all a blueprint.
[01:55:46.785 --> 01:55:49.548]  It's globalism, as Dr. Corsi said earlier in the hour.
[01:55:51.050 --> 01:55:52.031]  And he's an economist.
[01:55:52.031 --> 01:55:52.251]  Ted?
[01:56:21.210 --> 01:56:24.033]  And the people are going to be ending up being serfs.
[01:56:24.033 --> 01:56:29.979]  We're going to be working for taxes and that's it.
[01:56:29.979 --> 01:56:31.440]  There's just going to be nothing left.
[01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:35.364]  We're all going to be standing in soup lines if we keep going this direction.
[01:56:35.364 --> 01:56:37.266]  And it doesn't have to go this direction.
[01:56:37.266 --> 01:56:41.591]  It's all about this printing press that's going on in Washington, D.C.
[01:56:41.591 --> 01:56:44.734]  and a whole bunch of our elected officials becoming dependent upon it.
[01:56:45.214 --> 01:56:47.836]  And every time they implode another country, gold and silver goes up.
[01:56:47.836 --> 01:56:51.858]  Even in a dead time for gold and silver, like the middle of the summer, this is happening.
[01:56:51.858 --> 01:56:57.541]  When folks call for the specials, tell them it's a radio special, they got a whole list of things that are super discounted.
[01:56:57.541 --> 01:57:01.444]  Because Ted already has very competitive prices on his regular deals.
[01:57:01.444 --> 01:57:06.186]  But with the radio specials, he buys it when it's low, sells it when it's high, at the old price.
[01:57:06.186 --> 01:57:08.428]  They got a whole list of silver dollars, half dollars.
[01:57:09.068 --> 01:57:11.530]  Gold coins, European, US, they got it all.
[01:57:11.530 --> 01:57:12.171]  800-686-2237.
[01:57:12.171 --> 01:57:17.235]  Tell them it's the Alex Jones Radio Special.
[01:57:17.235 --> 01:57:23.600]  But Ted, I wanted to, at the end of this hour, show viewers and for radio listeners, go to the Mail Online, the Daily Mail.
[01:57:23.600 --> 01:57:27.203]  Peter Mandelson parties with his super-rich chums again.
[01:57:27.203 --> 01:57:30.866]  He's the Bilderberg minion that basically runs England.
[01:57:30.866 --> 01:57:32.507]  The Prime Minister's his creature.
[01:57:34.088 --> 01:57:36.510]  And the security guards definitely don't want you to see him.
[01:57:36.510 --> 01:57:39.732]  It was for Nathan Rothschild's birthday party.
[01:57:39.732 --> 01:57:46.936]  They had multi-hundred million dollar yachts, their own private island, supermodels out there with them.
[01:57:46.936 --> 01:57:59.944]  And meanwhile, Nathan Rothschild runs the big carbon exchange with Al Gore, openly saying with his cousin David Rothschild and Prince Philip and Prince Charles on record, you shouldn't be able to take a hot bath
[01:58:00.504 --> 01:58:06.008]  And shouldn't be able to have a car for the earth and you should pay them carbon credits so they can do this.
[01:58:06.008 --> 01:58:08.669]  I mean, this is a sick joke.
[01:58:08.669 --> 01:58:09.110]  It is.
[01:58:09.110 --> 01:58:10.911]  It's bringing back serfdom is what it is.
[01:58:10.911 --> 01:58:14.693]  I mean, the regular people, the common people are going to end up with nothing.
[01:58:14.693 --> 01:58:17.555]  We're going to end up paying taxes for this carbon thing.
[01:58:17.555 --> 01:58:19.496]  And it's just way out of hand, Alex.
[01:58:19.496 --> 01:58:20.657]  I mean, people need to wake up.
[01:58:20.657 --> 01:58:25.140]  They wrote in the 60s with the Club of Rome that it was a joke and they had to cook up something to tax
[01:58:25.880 --> 01:58:27.962]  A basic part of the life cycle.
[01:58:27.962 --> 01:58:32.885]  And then meanwhile they're just laughing at us and have all these idiot Hollywood people running around promoting it.
[01:58:32.885 --> 01:58:34.886]  Ted Anderson, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:58:34.886 --> 01:58:37.108]  We'll be right back with some key news.
[01:58:37.108 --> 01:58:38.889]  Stefan Molyneux is joining us.
[01:58:38.889 --> 01:58:42.511]  Stay with us.
[01:58:42.511 --> 01:58:46.013]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:46.013 --> 01:58:48.215]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.831 --> 01:58:55.374]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:58:55.374 --> 01:58:56.294]  Number 1.
[01:58:56.294 --> 01:58:59.717]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:58:59.717 --> 01:59:00.577]  Number 2.
[01:59:00.577 --> 01:59:05.460]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:05.460 --> 01:59:06.221]  It's true.
[01:59:06.221 --> 01:59:11.084]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:11.084 --> 01:59:11.904]  Number 3.
[01:59:11.904 --> 01:59:15.487]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:59:15.487 --> 01:59:19.189]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:59:19.389 --> 01:59:20.190]  Number 4.
[01:59:20.190 --> 01:59:22.953]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:59:22.953 --> 01:59:26.637]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:59:26.637 --> 01:59:27.417]  Number 5.
[01:59:27.417 --> 01:59:31.582]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:59:31.582 --> 01:59:36.347]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:59:36.607 --> 01:59:40.790]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:59:42.572 --> 01:59:44.833]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[01:59:47.436 --> 01:59:48.817]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:48.817 --> 01:59:54.761]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.629 --> 02:00:10.453]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.453 --> 02:00:12.034]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.034 --> 02:00:13.595]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.595 --> 02:00:17.798]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.798 --> 02:00:21.841]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.626 --> 02:00:27.492]  Alright, now into our number trace.
[02:00:27.492 --> 02:00:35.323]  Number 3, ladies and gentlemen, Stefan Molyneux, philosopher, researcher, extremist, will be joining us coming up.
[02:00:35.323 --> 02:00:36.565]  Means he believes 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[02:00:37.858 --> 02:00:38.759]  Totally insane.
[02:00:38.759 --> 02:00:41.760]  He'll be joining us coming up in the next segment.
[02:00:41.760 --> 02:00:43.741]  I tend to get a little bit satirical by the third hour.
[02:00:43.741 --> 02:00:46.103]  I gotta stop it.
[02:00:46.103 --> 02:00:47.643]  Just so much incredible news.
[02:00:47.643 --> 02:00:52.626]  Geithner on WNBC's Meet the Press.
[02:00:52.626 --> 02:00:53.587]  Okay, I gotta stop doing that.
[02:00:56.989 --> 02:01:06.096]  I happen to this weekend be watching some rare television and surfing through cable and saw like 10 minutes of Howard Stern's Private Parts where they got that actor doing that.
[02:01:06.096 --> 02:01:09.379]  Now let me tell you how you do radio here.
[02:01:09.379 --> 02:01:16.864]  Down there in Washington D.C., that's little kid stuff, alright?
[02:01:16.864 --> 02:01:21.368]  What we do here at NBC, this is real radio in New York City.
[02:01:21.368 --> 02:01:23.690]  So let me see you try to say it.
[02:01:23.690 --> 02:01:24.951]  And you say it like I say it.
[02:01:27.713 --> 02:01:31.359]  WNBC!
[02:01:31.359 --> 02:01:33.562]  I'm sorry.
[02:01:33.562 --> 02:01:34.724]  So ridiculous.
[02:01:34.724 --> 02:01:35.486]  It reminded me.
[02:01:35.486 --> 02:01:39.813]  I got hired in talk radio without even trying.
[02:01:44.485 --> 02:01:44.745]  I don't know.
[02:02:01.084 --> 02:02:08.372]  The program director's last job had been in a B-suit as the, uh, promotions person at a little bitty station, knew nothing about it.
[02:02:08.372 --> 02:02:11.655]  And he would call me in and, uh, tell me how to say the call letters.
[02:02:11.655 --> 02:02:12.837]  It was the same thing.
[02:02:12.837 --> 02:02:14.438]  And I'd sit there and I'd listen to this.
[02:02:14.438 --> 02:02:15.860]  Not that I knew anything about radio.
[02:02:15.860 --> 02:02:16.981]  I just knew about information.
[02:02:16.981 --> 02:02:17.682]  I'm a real guy.
[02:02:17.682 --> 02:02:19.203]  And it was not fun.
[02:02:21.563 --> 02:02:22.003]  Oh boy.
[02:02:22.003 --> 02:02:27.126]  You know, over the years you begin to sound more like a radio broadcaster just because you talk so much you get a cadence.
[02:02:27.126 --> 02:02:29.527]  People think radio is this certain sound.
[02:02:29.527 --> 02:02:36.151]  Really, the radio sound was 70-year-old guys that have been smoking two packs of cigarettes and drinking Jack Daniels their whole life.
[02:02:36.151 --> 02:02:39.793]  And I didn't get it from really cigarettes and Jack Daniels, well, maybe a little bit years ago.
[02:02:40.433 --> 02:02:51.637]  I mainly got this deep voice, always had a little bit of one, but a twang on top of it from screaming at political events and never taking voice lessons and actually coughing blood up a few times I was screaming so loud tearing my larynx.
[02:02:51.637 --> 02:02:58.359]  So that's how I got the 75-year-old whiskey drinker, cigarette smoker voice by the time I was about 30.
[02:02:58.359 --> 02:03:02.861]  Okay, now I'm digressing into things that don't even matter.
[02:03:02.861 --> 02:03:05.462]  Every one of these stacks of news is off the chart insane.
[02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:09.980]  Icaramba.
[02:03:09.980 --> 02:03:10.620]  What does that mean?
[02:03:10.620 --> 02:03:12.561]  You just popped in my ear and you said Icaramba.
[02:03:12.561 --> 02:03:17.102]  That's the B-suit guy from The Simpsons.
[02:03:17.102 --> 02:03:18.482]  Oh, Icaramba's the B-suit guy in The Simpsons.
[02:03:18.482 --> 02:03:20.242]  I don't know about The Simpsons.
[02:03:20.242 --> 02:03:25.483]  I've probably seen The Simpsons in the 15 years or whatever it's been on air 10 times.
[02:03:25.483 --> 02:03:26.643]  How long's The Simpsons been on?
[02:03:26.643 --> 02:03:30.604]  One of the longest running TV shows?
[02:03:30.604 --> 02:03:31.224]  Since I was in middle school.
[02:03:31.224 --> 02:03:32.024]  When you were in middle school.
[02:03:32.024 --> 02:03:33.885]  Well, since middle school, it's 20-something years.
[02:03:33.885 --> 02:03:35.165]  See, I don't know all these things.
[02:03:37.165 --> 02:03:44.649]  I just know there's that one kid in there that goes, his breath smells like dog food.
[02:03:44.649 --> 02:03:49.952]  Okay, now I start thinking about morning zoo programs and I'm starting it right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:03:49.952 --> 02:03:51.152]  I need to stop right now.
[02:03:51.152 --> 02:03:53.153]  I need to stop right now.
[02:03:53.153 --> 02:03:59.917]  A lot of folks, there's popular videos on YouTube where hosts have actually had me on morning zoo programs as guests.
[02:03:59.917 --> 02:04:02.259]  It is not a good thing.
[02:04:02.259 --> 02:04:04.660]  Because I can screw around worse than anybody.
[02:04:05.930 --> 02:04:09.872]  In fact, I'm really somebody that wants to screw around.
[02:04:09.872 --> 02:04:13.894]  I want to fool around, have a good time, be happy, laugh a lot.
[02:04:13.894 --> 02:04:16.316]  But I can't because there's a bunch of crooks trying to rob me.
[02:04:16.316 --> 02:04:20.858]  So instead, I research their crimes constantly and get angry.
[02:04:20.858 --> 02:04:21.879]  Here's an example.
[02:04:21.879 --> 02:04:27.562]  They knew 20 plus years ago when they were approving the latest types of cell phones that they caused massive brain tumors.
[02:04:28.542 --> 02:04:31.263]  And, uh, here's two news articles on it today.
[02:04:31.263 --> 02:04:33.223]  Uh, here's one from Fox News.
[02:04:33.223 --> 02:04:36.223]  Cell phones, cancer, and infertility.
[02:04:36.223 --> 02:04:42.945]  And they go through the studies of how it destroys your fertility and gives you brain cancer, and how they knew all along.
[02:04:42.945 --> 02:04:45.465]  So, uh, it breaks it all down.
[02:04:45.465 --> 02:04:47.505]  But again, I'm just a conspiracy theorist.
[02:04:47.505 --> 02:04:51.146]  Pretty soon, conspiracy theory will just be able to read.
[02:04:51.146 --> 02:04:55.747]  In fact, uh, is it true, granddaddy, that people once could walk
[02:04:56.769 --> 02:04:57.729]  Yes, it's true.
[02:04:57.729 --> 02:05:01.811]  You're a conspiracy theorist, Granddaddy.
[02:05:01.811 --> 02:05:17.297]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[02:05:17.297 --> 02:05:20.959]  My name is Mario Cifaldi, and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:21.980 --> 02:05:34.754]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:05:34.754 --> 02:05:42.021]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[02:05:42.702 --> 02:05:53.068]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[02:05:53.068 --> 02:05:57.010]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[02:05:57.010 --> 02:06:00.112]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[02:06:01.806 --> 02:06:03.507]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:06:03.507 --> 02:06:08.829]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:06:08.829 --> 02:06:10.349]  Saving means to make money.
[02:06:10.349 --> 02:06:19.153]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:06:19.873 --> 02:06:27.416]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:06:27.416 --> 02:06:35.419]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:06:35.419 --> 02:06:40.641]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[02:06:40.641 --> 02:06:42.802]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[02:07:00.407 --> 02:07:01.587]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:07:01.587 --> 02:07:08.530]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:07:08.530 --> 02:07:11.071]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:07:11.071 --> 02:07:16.453]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:07:16.453 --> 02:07:19.494]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:07:19.494 --> 02:07:21.555]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:07:21.815 --> 02:07:28.058]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:07:28.058 --> 02:07:31.439]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:07:31.439 --> 02:07:37.222]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:07:37.222 --> 02:07:38.863]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:07:38.863 --> 02:07:40.163]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:07:40.163 --> 02:07:42.824]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:07:42.824 --> 02:07:44.245]  He explains everything you need to know.
[02:07:44.525 --> 02:07:46.848]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:08:02.392 --> 02:08:09.023]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:09.023 --> 02:08:12.609]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:12.609 --> 02:08:14.371]  At the bottom right-hand corner...
[02:08:18.246 --> 02:08:22.427]  Of PrisonPlanet.com, we post some of the most informative videos.
[02:08:22.427 --> 02:08:26.868]  I did one today called The Controlled Left-Right Paradigm for Dummies.
[02:08:26.868 --> 02:08:28.328]  I think you'll want to watch it.
[02:08:28.328 --> 02:08:36.049]  Starring is my French Bulldog Captain, full name Captain Fantastic Jones, debuting there on the channel.
[02:08:36.049 --> 02:08:44.051]  There'll be more specials where he informs uninformed voters about the controlled left-right paradigm at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:08:44.918 --> 02:08:50.524]  Now, Obama has announced, and we're doing the Google search term today, Obama Dictatorship.
[02:08:50.524 --> 02:08:55.449]  Obama has announced he's doing carbon taxes without Congress passing it.
[02:08:55.449 --> 02:09:00.795]  He's doing internet kill switch, letting the Pentagon take over the internet without Congress passing cyber security.
[02:09:01.656 --> 02:09:05.599]  He is launching a Libya war and expanding it, getting ground forces ready.
[02:09:05.599 --> 02:09:07.720]  Even France said end the war and the U.S.
[02:09:07.720 --> 02:09:12.103]  is in the news saying no, we'll continue without Congress' approval.
[02:09:12.103 --> 02:09:14.244]  Just all completely unconstitutional, totally illegal.
[02:09:14.244 --> 02:09:16.145]  The Pentagon even told Obama.
[02:09:16.145 --> 02:09:27.372]  He set up the governor councils, the rural councils under FEMA with the Department of Defense and CIA and Homeland Security and TSA to operate in rural areas, spying on citizens.
[02:09:27.372 --> 02:09:27.993]  All announced.
[02:09:28.493 --> 02:09:30.755]  I mean, they're actually saying this.
[02:09:30.755 --> 02:09:32.456]  Who even needs a Congress?
[02:09:32.456 --> 02:09:36.959]  Who even... I mean, Obama is... Who even needs to go to church?
[02:09:36.959 --> 02:09:41.223]  You can just worship Obama, like the dear leader Kim Jong-il and now his son.
[02:09:41.223 --> 02:09:42.664]  That'll be three generations.
[02:09:42.664 --> 02:09:44.445]  Why not Obama's daughters?
[02:09:44.445 --> 02:09:45.866]  Can you put crowns on them?
[02:09:45.866 --> 02:09:49.469]  But don't worry, this isn't a dictator of the personalities, it's a dictator of the corporate...
[02:09:51.502 --> 02:10:04.367]  Communitarian collectivist, who collectivize our wealth through government control, who farm us, as Stéphane Molyneux talks about, really that goes back to Animal Farm, Eric Blair, aka George Orwell, and that's what it is.
[02:10:04.367 --> 02:10:06.528]  That's what the most ancient societies were about.
[02:10:06.528 --> 02:10:08.749]  Who was the smartest, the best hunter?
[02:10:08.749 --> 02:10:11.230]  That's who the small tribes would follow.
[02:10:11.230 --> 02:10:19.334]  Then the priest class was developed, and they learned not how to hunt good or build, but how to manipulate
[02:10:20.214 --> 02:10:20.775]  The humans.
[02:10:20.775 --> 02:10:33.286]  So it's a subgroup of humans operating in a predator class way against the rest of us and building a false environment for us from cradle to grave so that we will go along and perpetuate the parasitic oligarchy.
[02:10:33.286 --> 02:10:33.426]  Now...
[02:10:35.037 --> 02:10:41.841]  Our article, Obama's establishing a executive dictatorship is one of the most important in a long time.
[02:10:41.841 --> 02:10:42.721]  You notice more and more.
[02:10:42.721 --> 02:10:46.683]  I used to say very important once a year, now I say it every day because stuff gets crazier and crazier.
[02:10:46.683 --> 02:10:54.367]  But you read this article I put together with Paul Joseph Watson with the two videos I shot last night up here on the subject, and it goes over the whole thing.
[02:10:54.367 --> 02:10:57.149]  Gun control by executive order, he's now announcing.
[02:10:57.149 --> 02:10:58.890]  Oh yes, victim disarmament.
[02:10:58.890 --> 02:11:01.011]  War in Libya without congressional approval.
[02:11:01.011 --> 02:11:04.173]  Debt ceiling, he says he'll use civil war powers on the Congress.
[02:11:05.233 --> 02:11:06.393]  Like they're southern states.
[02:11:06.393 --> 02:11:07.374]  That's AP.
[02:11:07.374 --> 02:11:08.574]  You can't make this up.
[02:11:08.574 --> 02:11:10.855]  I was pinching myself last night when I saw this.
[02:11:10.855 --> 02:11:16.296]  Carbon taxes, Obamacare, Obama's rural councils, Obama Council of State Governors, Internet Kill Switch.
[02:11:16.296 --> 02:11:17.576]  That's just some of the examples.
[02:11:17.576 --> 02:11:21.517]  We're doing the search term, Obama Dictatorship.
[02:11:21.517 --> 02:11:27.539]  Put it in, those two words, over and over again, and then secondary search, Obama Establishing, to lead them back to this article.
[02:11:27.539 --> 02:11:28.899]  We always succeed in the past.
[02:11:28.899 --> 02:11:31.920]  Now it looks like they've got a big list of popular terms that are blocked.
[02:11:32.820 --> 02:11:33.881]  So we'll see if this works.
[02:11:33.881 --> 02:11:37.884]  If not, I'll do an archaic term tomorrow that's very rare, and it'll be number one.
[02:11:37.884 --> 02:11:43.147]  But we're almost, this is one of our last tests here to see since they changed the algorithm, so help us out with that.
[02:11:43.147 --> 02:11:46.649]  Now, going for the rest of the hour, and we'll take some of your calls the last 20 minutes at 800-259-9231.
[02:11:46.649 --> 02:11:46.729]  800-259-9231.
[02:11:46.729 --> 02:11:49.551]  Stefan Molyneux is a blogger, essayist, author, and host of Free Domain Radio.

[02:12:01.614 --> 02:12:14.283]  He's written numerous articles and essays which have been published at Libertarian, LewRockwell.com, AnnieWar.com, and he's done over 1,800 podcasts, self-published, and he's coming out with a bunch of books as well.
[02:12:14.283 --> 02:12:16.444]  So he joins us today.
[02:12:16.444 --> 02:12:17.985]  As promised, I wanted to get him back.
[02:12:17.985 --> 02:12:24.169]  Time flies via video Skype, and there's so much to discuss, but in a few minutes I want to play the
[02:12:25.550 --> 02:12:38.062]  WNBC, no the NBC piece with Geithner over the weekend where he came out, in fact I'm looking for the exact quote here, Geithner on
[02:12:39.349 --> 02:12:40.710]  That's very sad, but true, Alex.
[02:13:02.082 --> 02:13:04.226]  It's good to have an extremist on with us.
[02:13:04.226 --> 02:13:11.420]  What do you make of the fireworks going on in the economy, the police state, all the bizarre behavior?
[02:13:11.420 --> 02:13:13.604]  I mean, the ruling class is going insane.
[02:13:14.454 --> 02:13:15.654]  Well, you know what it is, Alex.
[02:13:15.654 --> 02:13:21.396]  I mean, my training is in history, and it's like a grim rewind to the last days of the Roman Empire.
[02:13:21.396 --> 02:13:36.382]  You could slap togas on these guys, and it would be pretty much a frame-to-frame repeat where you get the imperial presidency, you get the continual withering of Congress into a sclerotic kind of money-grubbing, taxpayer-raping kind of institution.
[02:13:37.182 --> 02:13:53.097]  This growth of charisma, this growth of dictatorial powers, this stepping over any last remnants and shreds of constitutional legality has all been played out before and I hope, I hope, I hope we learn enough from this phase in history that it's just not going to happen again.
[02:13:53.097 --> 02:13:54.979]  We can hope for the best that way.
[02:13:55.219 --> 02:13:56.479]  Well, that's what's horrifying.
[02:13:56.479 --> 02:14:08.444]  Anybody that's ever cracked a history book knows that excesses by corrupt elites using government power are legion and that liberty is the rare jewel that must be defended, as Thomas Jefferson said.
[02:14:08.444 --> 02:14:17.987]  I don't think the general public realizes that governments always go to complete excess and turn our wonderful lives into living nightmares.
[02:14:18.772 --> 02:14:25.559]  Well, and another thing that's interesting, what you can see going on in Europe is a very fascinating thing, which we talked about the last time I was on.
[02:14:25.559 --> 02:14:31.224]  That when government is at some point restrained or controlled or minimized, all it does is it opens up the free market.
[02:14:31.224 --> 02:14:33.066]  The free market generates wealth.
[02:14:33.066 --> 02:14:37.550]  The government then uses that excess wealth as collateral to borrow more.
[02:14:37.550 --> 02:14:42.655]  And so you can see the Irish Tiger of the 90s has now become one of the biggest debt-ridden countries in the EU.
[02:14:43.015 --> 02:14:46.596]  Portugal has had a 10-year very successful end of the war on drugs.
[02:14:46.596 --> 02:14:48.617]  You think that would give them lots of extra money?
[02:14:48.617 --> 02:14:50.097]  No, they're also going down.
[02:14:50.097 --> 02:15:02.741]  Moody has just downgraded Portugal's banks to junk status because we have a war going on between the US dollar and the euro about which one is going to, it's like watching King Kong and Tyrannosaurus Rex go at each other with chainsaws.
[02:15:02.741 --> 02:15:06.302]  It's which one is going to fall first, so there's a few extra dollars left over for the one that's next.
[02:15:06.302 --> 02:15:07.483]  It is like Mothra and Godzilla.
[02:15:08.343 --> 02:15:13.166]  That's right, except the special effects are even cheesier and the subtitles are even worse, but yeah.
[02:15:13.166 --> 02:15:15.047]  Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[02:15:15.047 --> 02:15:17.168]  You know that Bin Laden thing was real.
[02:15:17.168 --> 02:15:20.570]  I mean, there's no lies here.
[02:15:20.570 --> 02:15:27.714]  And you can see, of course, what happened when they're shipping drugs to, sorry, they're shipping weapons to Mexican drug lords.
[02:15:27.714 --> 02:15:32.257]  Yet again, we have another example of the people who are supposed to protect us arming
[02:15:32.637 --> 02:15:41.033]  Our enemies, just as they did with the Mujahideen in the 80s, and just as they did by giving lots of money and aid to the Soviets during the communist era.
[02:15:41.033 --> 02:15:42.215]  Saddam?
[02:15:42.215 --> 02:15:44.499]  Look, they're using Al Qaeda against Gaddafi right now.
[02:15:45.262 --> 02:15:54.885]  Right, Qaddafi, and one of the reasons Qaddafi was invaded was he's sitting on one of the largest gold stores in the world, unlike the rest of the countries which seem to be conveniently ignored.
[02:15:54.885 --> 02:16:05.548]  If you look at the economic drivers of this current economic collapse, one of the reasons, of course, is that the baby boomers are about to retire so they have to kill the system because there's simply no money there.
[02:16:05.548 --> 02:16:09.769]  So they have to create this emergency in order to get people to accept reduced circumstances.
[02:16:09.769 --> 02:16:13.210]  They have to create these wars to create these artificial emergencies and unity
[02:16:13.570 --> 02:16:23.098]  They have to fight against other currencies that are gaining ascendancy in the general fear that the Euro or some other currency is going to become the de facto trading currency for oil.
[02:16:23.098 --> 02:16:35.908]  If you just peel away the surface layers, it's all about control of fiat currency, control of the population, and of course it's our hope as thinkers and communicators that we can give people this red pill and have them wake up no matter how startling it might be.
[02:16:36.462 --> 02:16:39.883]  Let me ask your opinion or your educated view on this.
[02:16:39.883 --> 02:16:46.345]  I didn't know this, but it's been linked on Drudge all day, DrudgeReport.com, down in the middle of the article.
[02:16:46.345 --> 02:16:56.288]  They have the latest video of the six-year-old boy being groped once and crying, so they double-grope him to really teach him as he's crying.
[02:16:56.288 --> 02:16:58.029]  I think my children would cry if this was happening.
[02:16:58.029 --> 02:17:00.349]  I mean, they don't like strangers.
[02:17:00.349 --> 02:17:01.710]  I mean, that's a normal instinct.
[02:17:02.310 --> 02:17:05.773]  But TSA lied to lawmakers still conducting pat-downs.
[02:17:05.773 --> 02:17:09.616]  Why did they say in November, and again in April, that they're not doing pat-downs?
[02:17:09.616 --> 02:17:11.177]  And they said they'd stop doing them.
[02:17:11.177 --> 02:17:15.040]  Then they told Congress a month ago that it had stopped, and it's intensifying.
[02:17:15.040 --> 02:17:17.041]  I've witnessed it flying recently.
[02:17:17.041 --> 02:17:18.783]  What is this tactic of lying?
[02:17:18.783 --> 02:17:22.626]  Is it just to set the precedent that they're going to lie in plain view and they don't care?
[02:17:23.786 --> 02:17:26.667]  Yeah, I mean, there's that old joke, how do you know a politician is lying?
[02:17:26.667 --> 02:17:27.747]  There's a microphone around.
[02:17:27.747 --> 02:17:30.527]  And that is the way it goes.
[02:17:30.527 --> 02:17:32.108]  These people are sociopaths.
[02:17:32.108 --> 02:17:33.348]  They're pathological.
[02:17:33.348 --> 02:17:42.730]  There was a study that was done recently, and it's sort of not funny, though it is funny in a way, which said that serial killers have similar characteristics psychologically to politicians.
[02:17:42.730 --> 02:17:49.971]  With the exception that we don't give serial killers aircraft carriers, nuclear weapons, and endless prison systems to incarcerate their victims.
[02:17:50.111 --> 02:18:02.136]  Well, that's actually what's taught, as you know, in high-level criminology, that actually, they call them what high-functioning psychopaths tend to actually get into government.
[02:18:02.136 --> 02:18:12.800]  They don't start killing and stuff until they get that immunity and that power, and that's why the Stalins, the Hitlers, the Maos are the norm in history, and a Thomas Jefferson is the exception.
[02:18:13.780 --> 02:18:17.621]  Right, and so one of the characteristics of sociopaths is that they're consistently lying.
[02:18:17.621 --> 02:18:22.023]  The second is that they look for whatever weak spot you have and will exploit it for their own gain.
[02:18:22.023 --> 02:18:27.644]  And one of the things that's very true of the West, and I think this is very true of Americans, Americans are very, very generous people.
[02:18:27.644 --> 02:18:28.825]  They give a lot to charity.
[02:18:28.825 --> 02:18:30.325]  They really want to help the poor.
[02:18:30.325 --> 02:18:34.627]  And so the sociopaths in power say, ah, you care about the poor, do you?
[02:18:34.627 --> 02:18:36.067]  Well, we'll take care of the poor.
[02:18:36.067 --> 02:18:37.308]  And then they just raise the taxes.
[02:18:37.308 --> 02:18:38.468]  Oh, you care about the sick.
[02:18:38.468 --> 02:18:40.889]  Oh, let's raise the taxes so we can take care of the sick.
[02:18:41.989 --> 02:18:43.751]  Oh, you want the poor children to be educated?
[02:18:43.751 --> 02:18:44.572]  Bwahaha!
[02:18:44.572 --> 02:18:46.593]  Let's raise the taxes so we can educate the poor.
[02:18:46.593 --> 02:18:51.157]  And people fall for this without realizing that these things are just a pretext for increased staffing.
[02:18:51.157 --> 02:18:55.741]  And we'll give them shots so they don't get sick, filled with cancer viruses!
[02:18:55.741 --> 02:18:57.563]  Ha ha ha ha!
[02:18:57.563 --> 02:19:02.227]  Yeah, I miss the politicians that had those little pencil-thin mustaches that they could roll.
[02:19:02.227 --> 02:19:03.989]  You know, the bwahaha, that sort of evil laugh.
[02:19:05.824 --> 02:19:09.807]  There was a sort of funny joke in America, sorry, in England recently.
[02:19:09.807 --> 02:19:14.589]  One of the dictators from the Middle East came to visit England and they wanted to protest.
[02:19:14.589 --> 02:19:16.450]  The marching band wanted to protest.
[02:19:16.450 --> 02:19:23.214]  So they played the Emperor's theme from Star Wars, you know.
[02:19:23.214 --> 02:19:26.736]  I really feel that that should be played every time a politician walks into the room.
[02:19:26.736 --> 02:19:31.379]  They don't have to wear the black helmet and sound like they've got asthma, but I think that would really help clarify the point.
[02:19:31.539 --> 02:19:33.079]  ...position of power they have over us.
[02:19:33.079 --> 02:19:41.342]  And they should have stormtroopers on either side, just so the kids understand what sort of society they live in.
[02:19:41.342 --> 02:19:43.803]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:19:43.803 --> 02:19:45.843]  Don't act so surprised, your highness.
[02:19:45.843 --> 02:19:48.824]  You weren't on any mercy mission this time.
[02:19:48.824 --> 02:19:51.445]  Several transmissions were sent to this ship.
[02:19:51.445 --> 02:19:54.766]  I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.
[02:19:54.766 --> 02:19:57.447]  You are part of a rebel alliance and a traitor.
[02:19:57.447 --> 02:19:58.047]  Take her away!
[02:20:01.021 --> 02:20:07.407]  Hey, Brian, if you could do just one thing today to ensure your family's food security, what would it be?
[02:20:07.407 --> 02:20:08.427]  That's easy, Bill.
[02:20:08.427 --> 02:20:12.551]  I'd head straight to SoupBeanSurvival.com.
[02:20:12.551 --> 02:20:14.052]  SoupBeanSurvival.com?
[02:20:14.052 --> 02:20:24.021]  I know, Bill, it sounds crazy, but this ancient secret has been around for over 8,000 years, and it truly is nature's super survival food.
[02:20:24.201 --> 02:20:24.822]  Really, Brian?
[02:20:24.822 --> 02:20:26.844]  The number one survival food?
[02:20:26.844 --> 02:20:28.966]  Well, certainly the forgotten survival food.
[02:20:28.966 --> 02:20:29.987]  Absolutely, Bill.
[02:20:29.987 --> 02:20:41.300]  The folks at soupbeansurvival.com scoured our planet to find the very best heirloom seeds to truly find nature's super survival food.
[02:20:41.400 --> 02:20:43.522]  Brian, these aren't grocery store beans, are they?
[02:20:43.522 --> 02:20:44.402]  No way, Bill.
[02:20:44.402 --> 02:20:47.084]  You're not gonna find these beans in any grocery store.
[02:20:47.084 --> 02:20:50.526]  These are the absolute highest quality beans in the world.
[02:20:50.526 --> 02:20:53.208]  Visit soupbeanssurvival.com.
[02:20:53.208 --> 02:21:00.574]  That's soupbeanssurvival.com for all the information you're gonna need for nature's super survival food.
[02:21:00.574 --> 02:21:02.895]  They helped to create a new world order.
[02:21:02.895 --> 02:21:05.277]  We are part of a new world order.
[02:21:05.277 --> 02:21:07.659]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[02:21:08.459 --> 02:21:13.581]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:21:13.581 --> 02:21:18.082]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:21:18.082 --> 02:21:20.423]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:21:20.423 --> 02:21:23.304]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:21:23.304 --> 02:21:26.225]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:21:26.225 --> 02:21:33.828]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:21:34.167 --> 02:21:39.551]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:21:39.551 --> 02:21:42.413]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:21:42.413 --> 02:21:46.096]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:21:46.096 --> 02:21:47.156]  And I got news for you.
[02:21:47.156 --> 02:21:48.497]  You're everyone else.

[02:24:05.146 --> 02:24:06.227]  Most impressive.
[02:24:06.227 --> 02:24:07.308]  Big Brother.
[02:24:07.308 --> 02:24:09.089]  Mainstream media.

[02:24:27.765 --> 02:24:29.507]  The Emperor has foreseen this.
[02:24:33.403 --> 02:24:37.727]  Give yourself to the New World Order.
[02:24:37.727 --> 02:24:40.790]  Hand in your firearms.
[02:24:40.790 --> 02:24:47.136]  Submit to carbon taxes for the children and the bumblebees.
[02:24:47.136 --> 02:24:50.999]  Going back to Stefan Molyneux, that's enough from Sith Lord Darth Vader.
[02:24:50.999 --> 02:24:52.440]  Mr. Molyneux, this is a short segment.
[02:24:52.440 --> 02:24:54.182]  There's so much going on in the world.
[02:24:54.182 --> 02:24:57.145]  What is front and center on your radar screen?
[02:24:58.516 --> 02:25:07.919]  Well, I'm really, really quite interested in the way that the American credit rating agencies have downgraded Portugal's debt and seem to be on the verge of downgrading Italy's debt.
[02:25:07.919 --> 02:25:08.919]  Greece was fairly small.
[02:25:08.919 --> 02:25:10.820]  It's a very small part of the EU.
[02:25:10.820 --> 02:25:18.742]  But depending on how you measure it, Italy is between three and the third and fourth biggest one on the size economy in the EU.
[02:25:18.742 --> 02:25:26.624]  So I think that they're really doing an attack on the euro at the moment to cover up the fact that the dollar is taking such a big dive relative to the
[02:25:26.704 --> 02:25:27.124]  I think so.
[02:25:43.422 --> 02:25:47.447]  America has already defaulted on its debt because it's buying its own treasuries.
[02:25:47.447 --> 02:25:48.788]  Stay on the leader!
[02:25:48.788 --> 02:25:50.710]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:25:50.710 --> 02:25:54.114]  I think that's going to be... I think he's playing a video game while I'm talking, but that's okay.
[02:25:54.114 --> 02:25:55.395]  I can talk to the listeners.
[02:25:55.395 --> 02:26:03.284]  But no, I think that's really, really quite fascinating to see these two giant beast-dying currencies hacking away at each other rather than trying to deal with their own problems.
[02:26:03.664 --> 02:26:05.445]  Mathematically, the euro can't survive.
[02:26:05.445 --> 02:26:07.547]  Mathematically, the dollar can't survive.
[02:26:07.547 --> 02:26:11.669]  I don't know that there's much will to try and centralize these things into a larger central bank.
[02:26:11.669 --> 02:26:13.710]  I think that that's all kind of exhausted.
[02:26:13.710 --> 02:26:15.191]  So it is going to be quite fascinating.
[02:26:15.191 --> 02:26:22.576]  I think if we see a collapse of the euro, we might see a breakup of Europe into its more individual currencies, which might stave things off for a little longer.
[02:26:22.576 --> 02:26:26.899]  But, you know, I think people just really recognize deep down that the system as a whole
[02:26:27.759 --> 02:26:29.019]  I mean, I think it's already dead.
[02:26:29.019 --> 02:26:31.340]  I think it's just doing that after-death body-twisting stuff.
[02:26:31.340 --> 02:26:34.141]  I agree, and they sell us a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[02:26:34.141 --> 02:26:53.825]  If you look at the Rockefeller Foundation, over 100 years ago, now 111 years ago, they would fund the National Council of Churches to actually teach the end of the world's coming, don't get involved, you know, do whatever you're told, and now they have 2012 for the non-Christians to think the world's ending, so that people just have a foregone conclusion.
[02:26:53.825 --> 02:26:54.905]  No, it's the opposite!
[02:26:54.905 --> 02:26:56.266]  These elites are pathetic!
[02:26:56.266 --> 02:26:57.186]  They can be defeated!
[02:26:58.348 --> 02:27:07.035]  They can be defeated, and to me the fundamental argument is just waking people up to the violence in the system, to the fact that fiat currency is based on violence.
[02:27:07.035 --> 02:27:12.239]  It is based upon a legal and moral attack upon any competing currencies.
[02:27:12.239 --> 02:27:17.644]  Gold-based currencies are robbed and threatened throughout the world.
[02:27:17.644 --> 02:27:19.986]  Taxes is based on threats and violence.
[02:27:19.986 --> 02:27:22.688]  The war on drugs is based on threats and violence.
[02:27:22.688 --> 02:27:25.230]  The education of miseducation, indoctrination
[02:27:25.310 --> 02:27:28.693]  Fear will keep the local systems in line.
[02:27:28.693 --> 02:27:30.834]  Fear of this aircraft carrier.
[02:27:30.834 --> 02:27:31.975]  But that's impossible.
[02:27:31.975 --> 02:27:34.017]  Who will maintain control without the bureaucracy?
[02:27:34.017 --> 02:27:35.478]  Right.
[02:27:35.478 --> 02:27:44.826]  Yeah, there's this weird thing that because the government has a monopoly on something like educating the young, if you take the government out of the equation, somehow the young won't be educated.
[02:27:44.826 --> 02:27:50.730]  It's like saying if you take a huge rock out of the middle of a river, that the river is still going to go around the hole rather than fill it in.
[02:27:50.730 --> 02:27:51.391]  And that's this weird thing.
[02:27:51.651 --> 02:27:52.812]  Because the government does it.
[02:27:52.812 --> 02:27:54.633]  If the government doesn't do it, it won't be done.
[02:27:54.633 --> 02:27:58.115]  Like, there's no history where it was ever done before without the government.
[02:27:58.115 --> 02:27:59.856]  Roads were built without the government.
[02:27:59.856 --> 02:28:04.619]  The literacy rate prior to government education was far higher than it is now.
[02:28:04.619 --> 02:28:10.203]  Now we have this ridiculous spectacle of teachers cheating on tests in order to get bonuses.
[02:28:10.203 --> 02:28:12.124]  I mean, it's just sad and pitiful.
[02:28:12.124 --> 02:28:14.426]  The same thing with children get thrown out of school for
[02:28:15.146 --> 02:28:26.736]  Parents, sorry, teachers are getting rewarded for, and this is happening so far throughout the system, there's nothing in the system that is working anymore, except propaganda, which is always needed when a system doesn't work.
[02:28:26.736 --> 02:28:35.824]  And I just hope that the evidence is accumulating to the point where even the worst addict to state violence is waking up and saying, maybe this stuff doesn't work anymore.
[02:28:35.824 --> 02:28:37.045]  That's my particular hope.
[02:28:37.045 --> 02:28:39.848]  But of course, addicts are the last ones sometimes to see the basic truth.
[02:28:40.508 --> 02:29:01.136]  Well that's the other big issue is they keep drugs illegal so the big mega banks can make bigger profits when something's a black market it's more expensive and and I've even heard talk show hosts that are pro-drug war now coming out and admitting the government deals the drugs and the drug war is a fraud and so this what do you think the system's gonna do to try to stop this revolution of awakening?
[02:29:02.168 --> 02:29:07.669]  Well, what they're going to do is they're going to, as they're already doing, they're going to arm more of the drug lords, right?
[02:29:07.669 --> 02:29:11.910]  So lots of government weapons are going to find their way into the drug lords' hands.
[02:29:11.910 --> 02:29:15.111]  They're going to fund the crackdowns in Mexico and other places.
[02:29:15.111 --> 02:29:25.874]  And so this is to fight the example in Portugal, where 10 years of legalized drug use, or at least decriminalized drug use, has resulted in far lower drug addictions, far better treatment for the sick people who are addicted to drugs.
[02:29:25.874 --> 02:29:26.354]  And lower crime.
[02:29:27.114 --> 02:29:33.558]  Yeah, they're gonna lower crime, they're gonna arm the enemies, and so the enemies then create all of this violence, and then they say, Aha!
[02:29:33.558 --> 02:29:34.198]  You see?
[02:29:34.198 --> 02:29:35.138]  You need us!
[02:29:35.138 --> 02:29:39.581]  It's like the boss that he injects you with a poison and then says, I'm the only one with a cure!
[02:29:39.581 --> 02:29:41.742]  And that's all that they do, over and over again.
[02:29:41.742 --> 02:29:51.447]  Well, Stefan Molyneux's our guest, he's an extremist, he believes 2 plus 2 equals 4, I've never had such conspiracy theoritizing on my show, your call straight ahead.
[02:29:51.447 --> 02:29:54.349]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.

[02:31:02.276 --> 02:31:06.300]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:31:06.300 --> 02:31:09.544]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:31:09.544 --> 02:31:14.349]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:31:14.349 --> 02:31:20.736]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:31:20.736 --> 02:31:22.979]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:31:23.519 --> 02:31:23.819]  Tim Geithner?
[02:31:23.819 --> 02:31:24.320]  Bernanke?
[02:31:24.320 --> 02:31:24.981]  They're arsonists!
[02:31:24.981 --> 02:31:25.661]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:31:25.661 --> 02:31:26.462]  And the Congress is saying
[02:31:41.218 --> 02:31:42.420]  Who do we make the check out to?
[02:31:42.420 --> 02:31:44.542]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:31:44.542 --> 02:31:49.688]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[02:31:49.688 --> 02:31:58.819]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[02:32:03.698 --> 02:32:09.000]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:10.540]  Saving means to make money.

[02:32:27.590 --> 02:32:35.597]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:32:35.597 --> 02:32:40.841]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[02:33:12.424 --> 02:33:16.565]  By now you should have somehow realized what you gotta do.
[02:33:16.565 --> 02:33:23.827]  I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now.
[02:33:23.827 --> 02:33:25.168]  We are back live.
[02:33:25.168 --> 02:33:26.988]  We're here Monday through Friday 11 a.m.
[02:33:26.988 --> 02:33:27.548]  to 2 p.m.
[02:33:27.548 --> 02:33:29.289]  Central, 12 noon to 3 p.m.
[02:33:29.289 --> 02:33:29.629]  Eastern.
[02:33:31.345 --> 02:33:31.865]  What is that?
[02:33:31.865 --> 02:33:37.230]  10 to 1 Mountain, 9 to noon Pacific.
[02:33:37.230 --> 02:33:41.053]  Other times Greenwich, Mean, Imperial, Gallic, whatever you wish.
[02:33:41.053 --> 02:33:42.414]  Going back to Stefan Molyneux.
[02:33:42.414 --> 02:33:44.235]  We'll give you his website and things in a moment.
[02:33:44.235 --> 02:33:45.196]  And go to your phone calls.
[02:33:45.196 --> 02:33:47.758]  A toll free number to join us on any subject.
[02:33:47.758 --> 02:33:51.341]  Because our guest is just like I am, studying the news and history.
[02:33:51.341 --> 02:33:52.842]  He can speak to it from his own perspective.
[02:33:52.842 --> 02:33:52.882]  800-259-9231.
[02:33:57.620 --> 02:34:02.345]  Okay, I want to tell you about a few of the evil, I was going to be sarcastic, sponsors we have.
[02:34:02.345 --> 02:34:03.747]  One of them is very evil.
[02:34:03.747 --> 02:34:12.556]  They're water filters for whole house, below the sink, tabletop, handheld filters, water bottles, all made in America.
[02:34:12.556 --> 02:34:13.718]  Very evil.
[02:34:13.718 --> 02:34:15.560]  Purewaterfreedom.com.
[02:34:15.560 --> 02:34:17.001]  Take control of your water supply today.

[02:34:28.449 --> 02:34:34.412]  They have a wide variety of filters to remove all types of toxins from your water, including shower bath filters.
[02:34:34.412 --> 02:34:38.335]  But again, it's a conspiracy to not want all the poison in the tap water.
[02:34:38.335 --> 02:34:45.800]  Continuing, Interfood is a revolutionary 100% organic green superfood energy drink with powerful nutrition for better health, energy, mental clarity,
[02:34:46.482 --> 02:34:47.675]  Anemone System Support.
[02:34:48.661 --> 02:34:59.730]  It was even voted the best superfood by our friend, Mike Adams, from Natural News, because it's composed of nearly 50% chlorella, spirulina, kelp, dulse.
[02:34:59.730 --> 02:35:04.954]  It's also high in naturally occurring iodine, which can help safeguard against the harmful effects of radiation.
[02:35:04.954 --> 02:35:08.097]  Give them a call today at 866-762-9238 or visit them on the web at interfood.com.

[02:35:09.338 --> 02:35:09.638]  And lastly,

[02:35:26.246 --> 02:35:29.027]  This isn't like 12-year-old garbage like most companies are out there selling.
[02:35:29.027 --> 02:35:30.968]  This is brand new, high quality.
[02:35:30.968 --> 02:35:38.711]  That's over $1,700 worth of food you can store for you and your family for emergencies or until you need it, with a 15-year shelf life.
[02:35:38.711 --> 02:35:49.295]  To sign up, all you need to do is go to InfoWars.com or PrisonBonda.com and click on their banners or simply go to the special offer page at E, that's the letter E, foodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.

[02:35:56.479 --> 02:36:02.043]  efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex 800-409-5633.
[02:36:02.043 --> 02:36:03.464]  Going back to Stefan Molyneux.
[02:36:03.464 --> 02:36:07.887]  Stefan, tell us about your website and how people can visit that.
[02:36:08.720 --> 02:36:11.643]  Sure, it's at freedomainradio.com.
[02:36:11.643 --> 02:36:17.308]  It is the biggest philosophy conversation in history, but of course that's mostly just because of the new technology.
[02:36:17.308 --> 02:36:24.394]  And yeah, we've had like almost 35 million downloads and video views and 10,000 board members, and so it's a really thriving community of people.
[02:36:24.454 --> 02:36:27.295]  Briefly write down the tax farmer system for folks that aren't familiar with that.
[02:36:46.641 --> 02:37:01.737]  Sure, well, you know, you look at a map of the world and you see these geographical regions in different colors with labels, and a lot of people think that it's about culture and a lot of people think it's about nationalism, but the reality is that all of the countries that you see on a map are actually just...
[02:37:02.358 --> 02:37:03.678]  Tax farms.
[02:37:03.678 --> 02:37:15.640]  And they are very modern tax farms, where we are no longer assigned to our occupations like serfs, we're no longer owned directly like slaves, we're no longer eaten directly like the old-style cannibalism of the Stone Age.
[02:37:15.640 --> 02:37:23.182]  Now we're allowed to choose our own occupations, which makes us more productive, which means that we can generate more money and wealth for our owners.
[02:37:23.182 --> 02:37:28.502]  The problem is, of course, that democracy can't work without massive bribery of the population.
[02:37:28.502 --> 02:37:31.703]  It's as true now as it was in ancient Greece, as it was in ancient Rome.
[02:37:31.783 --> 02:37:37.238]  That creates the collectivism and then destroys the human species, turning us into lazy servile blobs.
[02:37:38.456 --> 02:37:40.957]  Well, I hope that we're not going to get to a destruction of the human species.
[02:37:40.957 --> 02:37:43.998]  It certainly does destroy the economy in the long run.
[02:37:43.998 --> 02:37:48.320]  You can't have a democracy without debt, because you have to bribe people, right?
[02:37:48.320 --> 02:37:54.182]  So the baby boomers who got three to four dollars in services for every dollar they paid in taxes thought it was the best system ever.
[02:37:54.182 --> 02:37:54.703]  Look at this!
[02:37:54.703 --> 02:37:58.944]  We've got all this free health care, we've got all this free stuff, it's wonderful and it's great.
[02:37:58.944 --> 02:38:05.047]  The problem is, of course, as Margaret Thatcher famously said, the problem with socialism is eventually you run out of other people's money to burn.
[02:38:05.247 --> 02:38:08.130]  Well, it's two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:38:08.130 --> 02:38:12.093]  What happens after the wolves have eaten all the sheep and eaten the sheep herder?
[02:38:12.093 --> 02:38:14.595]  You know, that's my issue for you.
[02:38:14.595 --> 02:38:25.325]  I see at the Bilderberg Group and things, a lot of big libertarians like the head of the PayPal mafia and others, you know, these multi-billionaires, they're pushing libertarian philosophy.
[02:38:25.885 --> 02:38:26.365]  But in
[02:38:45.563 --> 02:39:01.051]  The unfeasibility of the ongoing welfare state ignoring the banker bailouts, ignoring the fiat money system that was designed to be impossible to pay back and convert us from the greatest creditor nation to the greatest debtor nation, the same for every other nation.
[02:39:01.051 --> 02:39:10.697]  So, so, so, I mean, certainly you've seen in the whole globalist hive board, they're now putting some libertarian camouflage on top their backs a bit.
[02:39:11.477 --> 02:39:17.040]  Well, I'll tell you, Alex, you know the system is about to crash when libertarians are invited to run the show.
[02:39:17.040 --> 02:39:23.263]  Because that way, when the whole thing goes up in flames, everybody will remember, hey, who was in charge when it all crashed?
[02:39:23.263 --> 02:39:24.504]  Those crazy libertarians!
[02:39:24.504 --> 02:39:27.185]  And they'll just discredit freedom for another thousand years.
[02:39:27.185 --> 02:39:31.888]  So my strong, strong advice is, hey, you know, support Ron Paul, if you think he's a good educator, and I think he is.
[02:39:32.448 --> 02:39:46.893]  But for heaven's sakes, libertarians and anarchists, do not go anywhere near this Titanic because it already hit the iceberg and you do not want to be anywhere near political power when the giant sucking sound of imploding fiat currencies and collapsing economies is heard around the world.
[02:39:46.893 --> 02:39:50.815]  You want to make sure that all of the idiots who made this mess are in charge
[02:39:51.175 --> 02:39:51.996]  When it goes down.
[02:39:51.996 --> 02:39:54.699]  So I know there's a great temptation to get in there and try and fix it.
[02:39:54.699 --> 02:39:55.480]  It's way too late.
[02:39:55.480 --> 02:39:57.082]  It was too late with the Great Society.
[02:39:57.082 --> 02:40:00.586]  That's sealed the doom of Western democracies.
[02:40:00.586 --> 02:40:05.972]  So stay away from political power because don't be anywhere near the helm of this ship when it goes down.
[02:40:06.252 --> 02:40:14.516]  Sure, I mean, even if you would be against tariffs, it's not, you know, when another country has high tariffs on you, you raise yours, that actually creates, you know, a level playing field.
[02:40:14.516 --> 02:40:18.878]  So tariffs, when the other has tariffs, is actually free market at a limited level.
[02:40:18.878 --> 02:40:20.019]  You know, things are sophisticated.
[02:40:20.019 --> 02:40:21.439]  They're not just, you know, black and white.
[02:40:21.439 --> 02:40:23.100]  There's a lot of gray there.
[02:40:23.100 --> 02:40:26.242]  But I am for no tariffs if the other people were actually, you know, doing it.
[02:40:26.242 --> 02:40:31.024]  The problem is they are tax farms basically trying to cheat the other tax farms.
[02:40:31.024 --> 02:40:32.125]  But Ron Paul has said
[02:40:32.805 --> 02:40:35.806]  Now is the time for him to try to get in because it is imploding.
[02:40:35.806 --> 02:40:37.887]  He can go in and point out what they did.
[02:40:37.887 --> 02:40:41.889]  If not, they may use the implosion to sell more collectivism.
[02:40:41.889 --> 02:40:46.951]  But I do see your point about they could then scapegoat us like they did smooth haulings.
[02:40:46.951 --> 02:40:48.552]  The economy was already in a depression.
[02:40:48.552 --> 02:40:50.272]  They got in, put tariffs in.
[02:40:50.272 --> 02:40:56.575]  They then blamed the depression on that when it had been the collectivist engineering the whole situation from the beginning.
[02:40:56.575 --> 02:40:58.136]  Let's play a clip from
[02:40:59.296 --> 02:41:13.084]  NBC's Meet the Press with Tiny Tim Geithner, the guy who told the Chinese they're not devaluing the dollar, and they laughed at him a few years ago because they were informed, unlike certain people here in the United States.
[02:41:13.084 --> 02:41:19.468]  And let's play this clip where he says, the worst stuff of our lifetime's coming, it's going to be painful, and it's going to last for a long time.
[02:41:19.468 --> 02:41:20.148]  Here it is.
[02:41:20.148 --> 02:41:22.770]  Treasury, Tim Geithner, Mr. Secretary, welcome back.
[02:41:22.770 --> 02:41:23.631]  Nice to see you, David.
[02:41:23.631 --> 02:41:24.091]  What happened?
[02:41:25.179 --> 02:41:25.759]  Well, this is hard.
[02:41:25.759 --> 02:41:27.500]  You know, it's politically very hard.
[02:41:27.500 --> 02:41:29.881]  But this is a grave moment for the country.
[02:41:29.881 --> 02:41:34.903]  We need to do something very big, very substantial to bring our long-term deficits down over time.
[02:41:34.903 --> 02:41:40.106]  We have to do that in a way that's good for the economy, so we give more support to this economy still healing from the Great Recession.
[02:41:42.087 --> 02:41:43.529]  Oh!
[02:41:43.529 --> 02:41:49.715]  What does he actually say though?
[02:41:49.715 --> 02:41:51.556]  Because you're hearing two different things.
[02:41:51.556 --> 02:41:54.759]  You hear Boehner saying, look, they're demanding tax increases.
[02:41:54.759 --> 02:41:56.241]  We're not going to do that.
[02:41:56.241 --> 02:42:02.106]  They've also said that you were backpedaling a bit on whether you'd cut entitlement programs like Medicare or Social Security.
[02:42:02.106 --> 02:42:02.467]  What's the fact?
[02:42:02.947 --> 02:42:03.848]  That latter thing is not true.
[02:42:03.848 --> 02:42:05.009]  The President is standing tough.
[02:42:05.009 --> 02:42:08.271]  He is willing to do very, very difficult political things.
[02:42:08.271 --> 02:42:08.831]  Like?
[02:42:08.831 --> 02:42:17.278]  Like getting very substantial savings from the budget, across the budget, defense, the rest of government, even Medicare, Medicare for the long term.
[02:42:17.278 --> 02:42:23.182]  There are things we can do responsibly to save money in those programs, and we have to do that if we're going to bring these deficits under control.
[02:42:23.182 --> 02:42:27.045]  But to do that, we have to have some shared sacrifice.
[02:42:27.045 --> 02:42:30.507]  We have to find a way to avoid shifting more of the burden of the tax system to the middle class.
[02:42:31.388 --> 02:42:33.349]  It's going to take a balanced approach.
[02:42:33.349 --> 02:42:35.591]  Both sides are going to have to make some compromises.
[02:42:35.591 --> 02:42:37.972]  And you know, just one thing to Republicans.
[02:42:37.972 --> 02:42:39.513]  We know this is very hard to do.
[02:42:39.513 --> 02:42:43.115]  But they should not walk away now from trying to do something good for the country.
[02:42:43.115 --> 02:42:44.896]  This is very important for the country now.
[02:42:44.896 --> 02:42:46.977]  For the economy to be growing long term.
[02:42:46.977 --> 02:42:50.299]  Restore confidence that Washington can actually do things and solve some problems.
[02:42:50.299 --> 02:42:51.480]  We need both sides to come together.
[02:42:51.480 --> 02:42:54.162]  What was the President's reaction to Boehner's move?
[02:42:54.702 --> 02:43:03.386]  Well, you know, the president wants to do the right thing for the country, and he recognizes that to do the right thing, you have to try and do the biggest, most substantial deal possible.
[02:43:03.386 --> 02:43:05.246]  The deal that's going to be best for the economy.
[02:43:05.246 --> 02:43:07.287]  And, you know, his view is... All right, pause.
[02:43:07.287 --> 02:43:10.429]  He's going to bring people together... We had a miscommunication.
[02:43:10.429 --> 02:43:11.869]  I thought it was cued up to this quote.
[02:43:11.869 --> 02:43:12.930]  I know that's a long interview.
[02:43:12.930 --> 02:43:15.891]  Just see if you can, by the end of the show, find the place where he says, quote,
[02:43:17.853 --> 02:43:18.814]  Meet the press.
[02:43:18.814 --> 02:43:21.475]  That is a very tough economy, he says.
[02:43:47.793 --> 02:43:57.515]  And here they are telling us massive taxes on poor and middle class to pay the bankers who've written the tax laws where they're almost completely exempt, that that's going to fix things.
[02:43:57.515 --> 02:43:59.975]  I mean, these guys are something else, Stefan.
[02:43:59.975 --> 02:44:13.558]  And who is taking a shred of responsibility for the complete failure of TARP and the stimulus package and all of the money that was blown and burnt and sent into the stratosphere to supposedly deal with this crisis?
[02:44:13.558 --> 02:44:15.098]  Now, it's like nothing ever happened.
[02:44:15.498 --> 02:44:19.302]  That they had this huge plan that was supposed to rescue us from the recession.
[02:44:19.302 --> 02:44:22.787]  Now they're admitting there was a recession anyway, but we're much more in debt.
[02:44:22.787 --> 02:44:29.034]  And now they want to rape us again, and rape us again, it's the same thing in Greece, over and over again, and it's just never gonna end!
[02:44:29.034 --> 02:44:32.978]  And they, you know what, the dangerous thing is, don't you just hate being right all the time?
[02:44:32.978 --> 02:44:34.340]  Oh, I wish I would be wrong!
[02:44:34.580 --> 02:44:39.643]  You make these terrible predictions and you just want to be wrong, because they're starting to use the word sacrifice.
[02:44:39.643 --> 02:44:53.831]  I predicted this about a year ago, that there was going to be no recovery, and when there was no recovery, and things began to get worse and worse, and the debt ceiling was going to be bumped up against them, the entitlement programs were under threat, what they were going to start talking about, Alex, was the need for shared sacrifice.
[02:44:53.831 --> 02:44:55.332]  Yeah, now they've introduced a bill
[02:44:55.592 --> 02:44:56.272]  We're good to go.
[02:45:17.924 --> 02:45:21.125]  You allow them to take all the money out of your account and give it to the government?
[02:45:21.125 --> 02:45:25.847]  It's a contract where you waive all your rights in the future and allow them to share all your data.
[02:45:25.847 --> 02:45:31.488]  When you get a cloud computing thing with Amazon, they waive your rights and say they now own your data.
[02:45:31.488 --> 02:45:33.069]  I mean, these people are out of control.
[02:45:33.069 --> 02:45:34.189]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:45:34.189 --> 02:45:35.870]  No, they're completely out of control.
[02:45:35.870 --> 02:45:38.510]  And now they're going to start talking about sacrifice.
[02:45:38.510 --> 02:45:43.312]  And sacrifice is political ease for bend over, grab your shoelaces, this ain't going to be pretty.
[02:45:43.792 --> 02:45:45.453]  Well, take Lord Rothschild.
[02:45:45.453 --> 02:45:48.794]  He's got giant $300 million yachts, jet airplanes.
[02:45:48.794 --> 02:45:52.815]  He rented a whole giant island for his party for 300 people.
[02:45:52.815 --> 02:45:54.156]  World leaders went there.
[02:45:54.156 --> 02:45:55.977]  Taxpayer paid for security.
[02:45:55.977 --> 02:46:00.598]  They would come across the water, grab cameras from mainstream media, erase them.
[02:46:00.598 --> 02:46:10.802]  And he literally is then giving speeches about not being able to take a hot bath or have a heating in the winter because it's hurting the earth with carbon.
[02:46:10.802 --> 02:46:12.743]  I mean, it is such a sick joke.
[02:46:13.885 --> 02:46:18.188]  Yeah, I really, I have a tough time understanding how people take this at all, uh, seriously.
[02:46:18.188 --> 02:46:28.495]  But now this, this talk of sacrifice, when the ruling classes are backed into a corner and all of their disastrous uses of violence and deception have caught up with them, then they start talking about shared sacrifice.
[02:46:28.495 --> 02:46:41.223]  And shared sacrifice means y'all better get used to a pretty damn low standard of living, because the whole system is coming down and we're going to grab as much gold and treasure as we can, and you're going to be left with, uh, you know, Tang, uh, as your meals.
[02:46:41.223 --> 02:46:42.524]  And that is what is going to happen.
[02:46:43.925 --> 02:46:44.626]  Oh yeah, we're imploding!
[02:46:44.626 --> 02:46:44.966]  It's so fun!
[02:46:59.181 --> 02:47:05.105]  Yeah, they're absolutely doing that kind of stuff and it's completely wretched and we need to push back on the idea of sacrifice.
[02:47:05.105 --> 02:47:07.306]  This is not how the West was built.
[02:47:07.306 --> 02:47:15.631]  The West was not built on let's accept lower and less and more poverty and less access to information and less of a high standard of living.
[02:47:15.631 --> 02:47:17.372]  That had nothing to do with how the West was built.
[02:47:17.372 --> 02:47:27.158]  The West was built on life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, property rights and freedom and a growth in the economy that was continual so that we could deal with things like environmental problems by wealth.
[02:47:28.178 --> 02:47:29.038]  Not through poverty.
[02:47:29.038 --> 02:47:36.920]  You know, to solve environmental problems, you need an excess of wealth, so that you can install scrubbers, so that you can have more localized production of energy.
[02:47:36.920 --> 02:47:39.961]  You don't want a poverty-based reduction in your standard of living.
[02:47:39.961 --> 02:47:40.301]  That's right.
[02:47:40.301 --> 02:47:41.501]  Wealth makes things cleaner.
[02:47:41.501 --> 02:47:44.462]  Wealth, on record, makes you have less children.
[02:47:44.462 --> 02:47:47.703]  And instead, they've blocked development, making it filthy squalor.
[02:47:48.792 --> 02:48:04.940]  Yes, and they're going to call this sacrifice, and what they're going to do is they're going to try and make a virtue out of surrendering the last vestiges of your middle-class lifestyle and say, it's for the planet, it's for the children, it's for the future, it's for the spotted owl, it's for the fish in the sea, it's for every... This has nothing to do with it.
[02:48:04.940 --> 02:48:08.562]  The only way to solve environmental depredation is through the privatization.
[02:48:08.562 --> 02:48:11.403]  Oh, and here's another thing while I'm on that topic of privatization.
[02:48:11.403 --> 02:48:14.945]  You're also going to see a massive privatization of government, which is another
[02:48:15.365 --> 02:48:17.766]  Well, it's not real privatization either because it's all done inside deals.
[02:48:41.073 --> 02:48:42.715]  That's right, just as it was in Russia.
[02:48:56.070 --> 02:49:09.119]  They don't know how far this mortgage fraud goes and I imagine it goes enormously far and I bet you that the wisdom of Solomon could not figure out who actually owns a house in America anymore because it's been so split up and diversified and sold all over the planet.
[02:49:09.119 --> 02:49:24.689]  But now what they're saying is they're going to shake these banks down, the five or six major banks who defrauded the US government, defrauded the customers and lied about the, at least according to the allegations, lied about the quality of these investments to investors all around the world, that they're going to get let off with $30 billion.
[02:49:24.689 --> 02:49:25.870]  People say, well, that's a lot of money.
[02:49:26.130 --> 02:49:29.332]  But it doesn't come out of the pockets of the people who want it.
[02:49:29.332 --> 02:49:31.994]  There's 1.5 quadrillion in derivatives.
[02:49:31.994 --> 02:49:39.178]  Bank of America's taking houses they never even had a deed to that are paid for with people that have pure title going back decades.
[02:49:39.178 --> 02:49:46.783]  It is in the thousands of trillions, and yeah, they're telling the big banks, government's going to guarantee all this if you put 30 billion in.
[02:49:46.783 --> 02:49:49.324]  With the big six banks, that doesn't even come to 200, 300 billion.
[02:49:51.205 --> 02:49:56.206]  It is even near 1 trillion, and if the public hears 30 billion, that sounds big.
[02:49:56.206 --> 02:49:57.907]  You're absolutely right, Stefan Molyneux.
[02:49:57.907 --> 02:49:59.107]  Let's go to some calls.
[02:49:59.107 --> 02:50:05.009]  I'm skipping this network break, and I want to go five minutes into overdrive so we get to Beth, Michael, Brian, Sean, George, and others.
[02:50:05.009 --> 02:50:09.070]  You're on the air, Beth, from Texas, with Alex Jones and Stefan Molyneux.
[02:50:09.070 --> 02:50:10.430]  Welcome.
[02:50:10.430 --> 02:50:11.530]  Hi, Alex.
[02:50:11.530 --> 02:50:18.532]  What my question is, is I'm wondering with, I've bought some gold and silver, and what I'm wondering is, is that
[02:50:19.370 --> 02:50:26.633]  Um, are we ripe for confiscation, or will they do it in another way, basically through taxation?
[02:50:26.633 --> 02:50:32.075]  Um, right now, if I sell some of the gold and silver I have, there's a 28% capital gain.
[02:50:32.075 --> 02:50:35.076]  Well people do that under the, yeah, I'm not telling you what to do, but folks, that's why...
[02:50:35.876 --> 02:50:37.637]  Gold's really good because it's hard to track.
[02:50:37.637 --> 02:50:39.157]  Look, here's the deal.
[02:50:39.157 --> 02:50:40.658]  People say, why should I own gold?
[02:50:40.658 --> 02:50:41.518]  They could take it.
[02:50:41.518 --> 02:50:42.819]  Well, why should I have children?
[02:50:42.819 --> 02:50:45.620]  They could die in a car wreck or, you know, die of cancer.
[02:50:45.620 --> 02:50:48.601]  God forbid they don't, but I'm not, out of fear, not going to live.
[02:50:48.601 --> 02:50:50.602]  Gold and silver aren't perfect.
[02:50:50.602 --> 02:50:53.343]  And yes, I believe down the road they're going to try to slap taxes on.
[02:50:53.343 --> 02:50:55.123]  They're going to try to take it.
[02:50:55.123 --> 02:51:00.085]  But it's better than them just taking it through inflation or taking it right out of your bank account.
[02:51:00.085 --> 02:51:01.606]  It's harder for them to get.
[02:51:01.606 --> 02:51:02.026]  Do like
[02:51:02.486 --> 02:51:12.329]  My grandmother's father and my grandfather's father, both of them, different parts of Texas, didn't turn their gold in when the feds said do it in 33.
[02:51:12.329 --> 02:51:16.110]  And so it comes down to the end of the day saying, I'm not doing what you tell me, crooks.
[02:51:16.110 --> 02:51:18.690]  And if enough of us do it, they can't enforce on us.
[02:51:18.690 --> 02:51:20.271]  What do you say to that, Stefan Molyneux?
[02:51:20.931 --> 02:51:27.895]  Well, I think that's right, and I also think that it's well worthwhile buying stuff at the moment with your fiat currency that can't be taken, right?
[02:51:27.895 --> 02:51:31.176]  So buy a bunch of food, buy some water, you know, stock up a little bit.
[02:51:31.176 --> 02:51:37.459]  Even if you don't think there's going to be a huge collapse, there's sure as heck going to be massive inflation in food prices over the next year, so that's a great way.
[02:51:37.459 --> 02:51:40.401]  I mean, they're not going to come and take cans from your basement, so you can convert
[02:51:40.401 --> 02:51:41.622]  She's facing 90 days in jail for a tomato plant.
[02:51:41.622 --> 02:51:42.163]  In her yard, yeah.
[02:52:05.714 --> 02:52:07.214]  Yeah, very sad.
[02:52:07.214 --> 02:52:09.075]  Yeah, so that would be my suggestion.
[02:52:09.075 --> 02:52:16.316]  Beth, you can go in little coin shops and places, swap meets, you can buy gold and silver here and there.
[02:52:16.316 --> 02:52:18.677]  You can buy it from companies like Midas.
[02:52:18.677 --> 02:52:20.017]  I mean, so what?
[02:52:20.017 --> 02:52:26.538]  I mean, the crooks may announce tomorrow we've all got to be drafted to fight for Emperor Bumblebee or whoever's in power then.
[02:52:26.538 --> 02:52:29.859]  I mean, they may nuke Chicago and say the Easter Bunny did it.
[02:52:30.559 --> 02:52:35.163]  I mean, there's no telling what they'll do to try to make you love them through fear.
[02:52:35.163 --> 02:52:37.225]  And you just got to get the word out that they're the terrorists.
[02:52:37.225 --> 02:52:37.965]  They staged 9-11.
[02:52:37.965 --> 02:52:40.727]  And if you don't do that, they're going to keep staging terror attacks.
[02:52:40.727 --> 02:52:49.874]  That's their... How do you deal with government staging crises or wars as a pretext to make people primitively rally around the king, New World Order person?
[02:52:49.874 --> 02:52:50.175]  Stefan.
[02:52:50.788 --> 02:52:54.651]  Well, I think all you have to do is point out the number of times that these things have occurred before.
[02:52:54.651 --> 02:53:01.635]  I mean, it's well established now that the Gulf of Tompkins incident was staged and fabricated, and that started a war that killed millions of people.
[02:53:01.635 --> 02:53:07.499]  Everybody's completely aware about the lies about the WMDs in both the British and American press.
[02:53:07.499 --> 02:53:11.582]  And isn't it shocking that the news of the world is shut down because they hacked a few cell phones?
[02:53:11.582 --> 02:53:17.686]  The fact that they supported a war that's killed over a million people and driven millions more into exile, that didn't get them shut down!
[02:53:18.046 --> 02:53:19.307]  This is political fighting.
[02:53:19.307 --> 02:53:22.749]  This is Soros striking at Murdoch.
[02:53:22.749 --> 02:53:26.491]  You know, these globalists even get in little fights with each other.
[02:53:26.491 --> 02:53:27.091]  Yeah, that's true.
[02:53:27.091 --> 02:53:29.512]  They're the turf wars, like the five families in New York.
[02:53:29.512 --> 02:53:36.656]  They're just turf wars, and we think that it's got something to do with our freedom, but it's just them battling over our tax revenue, which is really quite sad.
[02:53:36.656 --> 02:53:37.357]  Absolutely.
[02:53:37.357 --> 02:53:38.818]  I mean, well said.
[02:53:38.818 --> 02:53:39.618]  I'm glad you brought that up.
[02:53:39.618 --> 02:53:40.198]  Thank you, Beth.
[02:53:40.198 --> 02:53:41.959]  Does that answer your question?
[02:53:41.959 --> 02:53:42.540]  Yes, it does.
[02:53:42.540 --> 02:53:42.880]  Thank you.
[02:53:43.390 --> 02:53:46.331]  Thank you, and I want to just say I'm not with Stefan Molyneux.
[02:53:46.331 --> 02:53:57.517]  I agree that up in Michigan, and in other areas where they're arresting people for growing tomatoes in their yard, I think that's reasonable, and that's what George Washington fought for.
[02:53:57.517 --> 02:54:00.138]  I'm not with the extremists, okay?
[02:54:00.138 --> 02:54:04.080]  Right, well, you know, he obviously cut down the cherry tree because you don't want to eat cherries.
[02:54:04.080 --> 02:54:11.184]  You know, he understood that the war really needs to be against fruits and vegetables, so I think that's why he chopped down that tree, and I think we're all with him on that.
[02:54:11.917 --> 02:54:15.659]  Stephan, you are really starting to get it.
[02:54:15.659 --> 02:54:16.499]  I really am.
[02:54:16.499 --> 02:54:17.660]  You're not an extremist now.
[02:54:17.660 --> 02:54:18.000]  Good.
[02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:21.321]  I feel like I'm not being dragged behind the train of Alex Jones.
[02:54:21.321 --> 02:54:24.263]  I'm actually clambering on the caboose and starting to walk up.
[02:54:24.263 --> 02:54:24.963]  And it feels good.
[02:54:24.963 --> 02:54:25.543]  I know.
[02:54:25.543 --> 02:54:28.685]  I think you're on your own train way up ahead of me there, my friend.
[02:54:28.685 --> 02:54:30.706]  You can't do Darth Vader yet, but we'll get you there.
[02:54:30.706 --> 02:54:33.467]  Michael, in Florida, you're on the air with an evil person.
[02:54:33.467 --> 02:54:34.768]  Go ahead.
[02:54:34.768 --> 02:54:35.628]  Oh, Michelle.
[02:54:35.628 --> 02:54:36.048]  Michelle.
[02:54:36.048 --> 02:54:36.848]  I've got to read that better.
[02:54:36.848 --> 02:54:37.769]  Michelle, welcome.
[02:54:38.445 --> 02:54:39.026]  Hi, Alex.
[02:54:39.026 --> 02:54:39.927]  Hi, Stefan.
[02:54:39.927 --> 02:54:43.731]  Mine isn't so much of a question as if I wanted both your thoughts on this.
[02:54:43.731 --> 02:54:50.458]  You've been talking about, for the past few weeks, a possible false flag, maybe in America or in Europe, with Gaddafi.
[02:54:50.458 --> 02:54:51.739]  Well, they would never do that.
[02:54:51.739 --> 02:54:55.122]  I mean, they shipped 30,000 guns, to blame it on the Second Amendment, into Mexico.
[02:54:55.122 --> 02:54:57.124]  And then perjured themselves.
[02:54:57.124 --> 02:54:58.506]  They would never stage a terror attack.
[02:54:58.506 --> 02:54:59.086]  I'm sorry, ma'am.
[02:54:59.086 --> 02:54:59.387]  Go ahead.
[02:54:59.767 --> 02:55:00.687]  That's okay.
[02:55:00.687 --> 02:55:12.313]  My thought was, I know that we're the resistance and a lot of the Christian people, but they're supposed to be having this big summit in Washington, the CUFI, on July 18th through the 20th, I thought.
[02:55:12.313 --> 02:55:18.055]  But anyway, is it too far out there to think because Glenn Beck's supposed to be there and you just said they're going to blame it on Glenn Beck?
[02:55:18.055 --> 02:55:21.436]  Do you think it's possible that they would try a false flag?
[02:55:21.436 --> 02:55:22.457]  I mean, with thousands of
[02:55:22.777 --> 02:55:35.119]  Well, let's not give them any idea, but yeah, they're all scaring us about the caliphate and Muslim extremists, and then publicly funding all the groups in every case, and funding al-Qaeda right now against Qaddafi.
[02:55:35.119 --> 02:55:38.000]  I mean, I'm not saying some of these groups aren't out of control and dangerous.
[02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:39.560]  The point is, who fed that dog?
[02:55:39.560 --> 02:55:41.080]  Who trained that dog?
[02:55:41.080 --> 02:55:44.881]  And absolutely, false flag is the next card they're going to pull.
[02:55:44.881 --> 02:55:45.721]  You better believe it.
[02:55:45.721 --> 02:55:52.382]  You can see all the prepping and priming and Jim Jones Kool-Aid drills where they're telling us, when the terrorists attack, what do you do?
[02:55:52.662 --> 02:55:54.483]  Give our rights up to you!
[02:55:54.483 --> 02:55:56.305]  What do you do when the terrorists attack?
[02:55:56.305 --> 02:55:58.426]  Bend over and give you my bank account!
[02:55:58.426 --> 02:56:00.107]  What do you do when the terrorists attack?
[02:56:00.107 --> 02:56:02.129]  Let you grope our five-year-olds!
[02:56:02.129 --> 02:56:04.250]  What do you do when we stage the terror attack?
[02:56:04.250 --> 02:56:05.351]  Worship you!
[02:56:05.351 --> 02:56:07.072]  You're our daddy!
[02:56:07.072 --> 02:56:08.593]  Thank you for the call, Michelle.
[02:56:08.593 --> 02:56:10.635]  I'm gonna go to Brian, Sean, George, Lee.
[02:56:10.635 --> 02:56:11.455]  The show's about to end.
[02:56:11.455 --> 02:56:14.337]  We'll have internet only for five minutes if Stefan can do it to finish those calls.
[02:56:14.337 --> 02:56:16.119]  Your comments on what I just said, Stefan Molyneux.
[02:56:17.290 --> 02:56:19.231]  Well, you can see this happening already, Alex.
[02:56:19.231 --> 02:56:24.334]  I mean, they've cut hundreds of millions of dollars in military funding to Pakistan, which is going to destabilize the ruling governments.
[02:56:24.334 --> 02:56:31.878]  People don't understand, many people don't understand the degree to which tyrannies around the world are supported by Western money for a variety of nasty and evil reasons.
[02:56:31.878 --> 02:56:39.722]  So, there's going to be destabilization in Pakistan and that, of course, is going to be pretext for another intervention and more control and more growth.
[02:56:39.722 --> 02:56:42.224]  So, you just need to keep exploding this stuff ahead of time.
[02:56:42.224 --> 02:56:44.405]  Put the predictions out there and try and be as right as
[02:56:44.625 --> 02:56:44.825]  Hi Alex.
[02:57:10.785 --> 02:57:23.168]  Hey, I'm just sitting here with my 14-year-old daughter, working on getting her woken up, and thanks for waking me up, because I passed on a favor to a number of my friends, and they're getting the idea.
[02:57:23.168 --> 02:57:24.508]  But I had an idea.
[02:57:24.508 --> 02:57:30.869]  You were talking about Ron Paul, and I had a couple campaign slogans for Dr. Paul.
[02:57:30.869 --> 02:57:32.490]  Do you want to hear them?
[02:57:32.490 --> 02:57:33.530]  Yes, tell us.
[02:57:33.530 --> 02:57:35.690]  The extremists, go ahead.
[02:57:35.690 --> 02:57:36.631]  They're adaptations.
[02:57:36.631 --> 02:57:38.651]  The first one is, Paul and no fed.
[02:57:41.657 --> 02:57:45.000]  The second one is, it's the Federal Reserve, stupid.
[02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:46.081]  Alright, glad you like it.
[02:57:46.081 --> 02:57:49.003]  And you know, if he would just get up there while he's got a platform on the debates...
[02:57:56.701 --> 02:58:02.866]  He just started saying to the American people, did you know that the Federal Reserve is owned by Rockefeller, Rothschild, Warburg?
[02:58:02.866 --> 02:58:09.531]  I agree, Ron Paul's great, but if he got a lot more hardcore, then that would have a bigger effect.
[02:58:09.531 --> 02:58:12.814]  Maybe we can give Ron Paul some Red Bull before he gets up there.
[02:58:16.021 --> 02:58:16.421]  Yeah.
[02:58:16.421 --> 02:58:19.662]  Hey, just wanna say... Maybe we can waterboard Ron Paul with coffee.
[02:58:19.662 --> 02:58:26.445]  Starbucks coffee for... No, the guy's 75 years old, works all day long, and he's a gentleman.
[02:58:26.445 --> 02:58:27.765]  Listen, I gotta go.
[02:58:27.765 --> 02:58:35.127]  Stefan Molyneux, the main radio show's over, but I'm gonna do five more minutes into Overdrive Internet Only at Infowars.com and talk to Sean, George, and Lee.
[02:58:35.127 --> 02:58:36.568]  Quick questions for Stefan Molyneux.
[02:58:36.568 --> 02:58:37.788]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:58:37.788 --> 02:58:39.409]  We'll see you back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[02:58:39.409 --> 02:58:39.909]  Central.
[02:58:39.909 --> 02:58:41.209]  Spread the word, evil people.
[02:58:41.209 --> 02:58:45.531]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:47.182 --> 02:58:49.373]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[02:58:51.223 --> 02:58:55.766]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:58:55.766 --> 02:58:56.686]  Number one.
[02:58:56.686 --> 02:59:00.109]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:59:00.109 --> 02:59:00.969]  Number two.
[02:59:00.969 --> 02:59:05.872]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:59:05.872 --> 02:59:06.613]  It's true.
[02:59:06.613 --> 02:59:11.476]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:59:11.476 --> 02:59:12.316]  Number three.
[02:59:12.316 --> 02:59:15.899]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:59:15.899 --> 02:59:19.581]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:59:19.801 --> 02:59:20.601]  Number 4.
[02:59:20.601 --> 02:59:23.342]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:59:23.342 --> 02:59:27.024]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:59:27.024 --> 02:59:27.824]  Number 5.
[02:59:27.824 --> 02:59:31.966]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:59:31.966 --> 02:59:37.028]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:59:37.028 --> 02:59:41.189]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:41.189 --> 02:59:42.990]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:42.990 --> 02:59:47.592]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[02:59:47.892 --> 02:59:48.172]  877-327-0365.
[02:59:48.172 --> 02:59:53.660]  Coast to Coast.
[02:59:53.660 --> 02:59:55.722]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.722 --> 02:59:58.926]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:07.728 --> 03:00:11.391]  Don't forget, folks, to get our article at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:00:11.391 --> 03:00:14.293]  Obama's establishing an executive dictatorship.
[03:00:14.293 --> 03:00:15.554]  This is really happening.
[03:00:15.554 --> 03:00:17.255]  It's all the proofs there.
[03:00:17.255 --> 03:00:21.579]  We're searching the term Obama dictatorship to try to make it number one on Google.
[03:00:21.579 --> 03:00:22.940]  Going back to Stefan Molyneux.
[03:00:22.940 --> 03:00:26.222]  We've only got five minutes left right now.
[03:00:26.222 --> 03:00:28.444]  Let's talk to Sean in Wyoming.
[03:00:28.444 --> 03:00:29.165]  Sean, go ahead.
[03:00:30.506 --> 03:00:31.247]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:00:31.247 --> 03:00:34.971]  I just want to say thank you for waking me up.
[03:00:34.971 --> 03:00:37.033]  I'm honored to be on your show.
[03:00:37.033 --> 03:00:41.017]  And I speak for the majority of the American people when I say we're sick of this!
[03:00:41.017 --> 03:00:41.758]  I'm tired of this!
[03:00:46.132 --> 03:00:48.594]  Everything, everything that is controlled.
[03:00:48.594 --> 03:00:51.837]  I mean, let me give you a little background on myself.
[03:00:51.837 --> 03:01:01.606]  I'm going to college this fall to be a personal trainer slash physical education teacher, and I've been trying to get food that is good for me, and it's not nowhere to be found.
[03:01:01.606 --> 03:01:04.028]  Not al-qaeda tomatoes!
[03:01:04.028 --> 03:01:08.191]  Oh yeah, the farms around America is, has been.
[03:01:08.191 --> 03:01:10.834]  Stephon, we got another one of these people that doesn't want to eat GMO.
[03:01:11.806 --> 03:01:14.450]  Yep, I don't want to eat GMO, I don't want to eat none of that.
[03:01:14.450 --> 03:01:16.472]  I saw the actual posters.
[03:01:16.472 --> 03:01:18.675]  They claim to be grass-fed beef.
[03:01:18.675 --> 03:01:20.117]  I don't even know if it really is.
[03:01:20.117 --> 03:01:21.859]  Terrorists!
[03:01:21.859 --> 03:01:24.643]  Okay, I appreciate your call.
[03:01:24.643 --> 03:01:25.845]  I understand your anger.
[03:01:25.845 --> 03:01:29.289]  Stefan, it's good that folks are getting angry because that's the first step in getting woken up.
[03:01:30.032 --> 03:01:31.153]  Absolutely.
[03:01:31.153 --> 03:01:37.476]  You know, the fight-or-flight mechanism, if we can tamp down the flight and focus on the fight, I think that's a good use of adrenaline these days.
[03:01:37.476 --> 03:01:39.697]  Well done, Lord Mullineaux.
[03:01:39.697 --> 03:01:43.800]  Let's go ahead and talk to George in Connecticut.
[03:01:43.800 --> 03:01:46.241]  You're on the air, my friend.
[03:01:46.241 --> 03:01:48.042]  Good to speak to you again.
[03:01:48.042 --> 03:01:54.606]  I heard some people talking over on a Sunday show on WABC in New York area coming into my state, Connecticut.
[03:01:55.140 --> 03:01:59.143]  And I couldn't believe it, it almost sounded like your hardcore show!
[03:01:59.143 --> 03:02:02.305]  I mean, you're bleeding over to a lot of different networks.
[03:02:02.305 --> 03:02:03.746]  You're beating their tail off.
[03:02:03.746 --> 03:02:06.047]  Now they can no longer keep it quiet anymore.
[03:02:25.821 --> 03:02:37.629]  Well, if you put something in someone's food that continually makes them fat, you know, like corn syrup or whatever, this sort of stuff, then they may not believe you for a while because it's like, ooh, this tastes good, I like it.
[03:02:37.629 --> 03:02:47.236]  But eventually, when they look down and they can't see, let's say, their toes, for want of a better word, if they look down and they can't see their toes because their gut is so big, at that point they may believe you.
[03:02:47.236 --> 03:02:53.841]  Because if you don't believe the reason and the arguments and the evidence ahead of time, you then have to accept the evidence after the fact.
[03:02:53.841 --> 03:02:54.181]  And the fact
[03:02:54.241 --> 03:03:05.414]  The fact that the system is breaking down so badly is proof that it's immoral at its core and so people who didn't accept the moral arguments now are seeing the terrible effects of violence and that's, I think, enough to shore up our moral arguments.
[03:03:05.414 --> 03:03:08.697]  I want to get one last caller in, but George, what were they talking about on WABC?
[03:03:09.813 --> 03:03:16.715]  Oh, they were talking everything from the Federal Reserve to the ways of being raped and how they're going to be raping Social Security.
[03:03:16.715 --> 03:03:21.337]  I heard it on several different shows that ABC was the biggest because they're one of the biggest networks.
[03:03:21.337 --> 03:03:22.057]  No, I know.
[03:03:22.057 --> 03:03:23.337]  W-A-B-C!
[03:03:23.337 --> 03:03:24.718]  Appreciate the call.
[03:03:24.718 --> 03:03:25.918]  Let's talk to Lee in Minnesota.
[03:03:25.918 --> 03:03:28.219]  He'll be our tail gunner with Stefan Molyneux today.
[03:03:28.219 --> 03:03:30.739]  Go ahead, hit us and hit us hard.
[03:03:30.739 --> 03:03:38.862]  Alex, Stephen, I would like to ask both of you quickly today, and maybe you could get into this more, Alex, tomorrow or the next day,
[03:03:39.435 --> 03:03:54.603]  About particularly what they're talking about with the 14th Amendment, because I believe, I believe, Stephen, that things are already dead, and that they will invoke this clause, what, from 1868?
[03:03:54.603 --> 03:04:03.267]  Yeah, I saw this weird, creepy, he's gonna be like, Abraham Lincoln, you watch stuff, even in the campaign, and they're now trying to invoke it.
[03:04:03.267 --> 03:04:05.908]  I appreciate your call.
[03:04:05.908 --> 03:04:07.129]  Stephen Molyneux, what do you think of that?
[03:04:08.191 --> 03:04:09.712]  Okay, remind me about the 14th Amendment.
[03:04:09.712 --> 03:04:13.594]  Well, they're now announcing the President can basically be a dictator.
[03:04:13.594 --> 03:04:15.996]  Oh, yeah, but that's, I mean, what do you mean can be a dictator?
[03:04:15.996 --> 03:04:18.057]  He's already been a dictator for quite some time.
[03:04:18.057 --> 03:04:30.224]  I mean, there was somebody who asked Nancy Pelosi, some reporter asked Nancy Pelosi prior to Obamacare, he said, what aspect of the Constitution allows the federal government to mandate health insurance for Americans?
[03:04:30.544 --> 03:04:36.289]  And she just looked at him like he was speaking Martian out of his armpit because it's like, what on earth would the Constitution have to do with anything?
[03:04:36.289 --> 03:04:40.532]  We're out of time, Stefan, but I want to go out here with you with a war growl.
[03:04:40.532 --> 03:04:41.653]  Let's stop the flight.
[03:04:41.653 --> 03:04:43.174]  Let's get the fight going.
[03:04:43.174 --> 03:04:44.695]  Do it with me on three.
[03:04:44.695 --> 03:04:47.497]  One, two, three.
[03:04:47.497 --> 03:04:48.358]  Cut back to him.
[03:04:48.358 --> 03:04:49.319]  Yeah.
[03:04:49.319 --> 03:04:50.079]  Let's give us another one.
[03:04:50.079 --> 03:04:51.280]  I want to see you.
[03:04:51.280 --> 03:04:51.901]  Come on, Stefan.
[03:04:56.002 --> 03:04:57.206]  Wake up, folks!
[03:04:57.206 --> 03:04:57.827]  Wake up!
[03:04:57.827 --> 03:04:58.489]  Fight back!
[03:04:58.489 --> 03:04:59.492]  See you back tomorrow live.
[03:04:59.492 --> 03:05:00.695]  Spread the word about the transmission.
[03:05:00.695 --> 03:05:01.237]  Thank you, Stefan.
[03:05:01.237 --> 03:05:01.939]  Great job, crew.
