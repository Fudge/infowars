[00:00:04.963 --> 00:00:09.805]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.805 --> 00:00:11.385]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.385 --> 00:00:12.946]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:17.127]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.127 --> 00:00:21.188]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.460]  It is Monday, the 22nd day of August 2011.
[00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.201]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:48.201 --> 00:00:52.622]  I am your host, Alex Jones, joining us coming up in an hour and a half from now.
[00:00:52.622 --> 00:01:00.484]  Gerald Salente, the Trends Research Forecaster, will be joining us to talk about the economy and other major world events in
[00:01:01.877 --> 00:01:08.920]  Libya and other nations across the planet, including Syria, next target on the globalist hit list.
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:18.243]  Webster Griffin Tarpley, who's been to Libya many times over the years and spent several weeks there a few months ago, will be joining us.
[00:01:18.243 --> 00:01:27.947]  Of course, the conflict that lasted six months total, four and a half months of ongoing public NATO involvement, is far from over.
[00:01:28.795 --> 00:01:41.900]  Now the Al Qaeda forces that have taken over much of Tripoli and most of the other major cities will now engage in a reign of bloody slaughter, terror and mass murder, show trials, you name it.
[00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:51.104]  And of course much of the gold and much of the frozen Libyan bank accounts will be given to Al Qaeda as a new command base
[00:01:51.724 --> 00:02:08.352]  And I predict within the next few years, there'll have to be another invasion, and the media won't even point out that the West put these guys in, and they'll say, oh my gosh, Al-Qaeda hit us and hit us hard, we've got to invade Libya again because of that dirty Al-C-I-A-D-A.
[00:02:08.352 --> 00:02:12.995]  So we're going to be going over those reports coming up after the first break.
[00:02:12.995 --> 00:02:15.296]  NATO hands terrorists who killed U.S.
[00:02:15.296 --> 00:02:16.977]  troops control of Libya.
[00:02:17.577 --> 00:02:22.764]  Paul Joseph Watson has a detailed report at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com
[00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:31.255]  Live from Western Tripoli, Western media complicit in NATO's humanitarian bloodbath.
[00:02:31.255 --> 00:02:36.118]  That's what reporters for Global Research are saying on the ground, and they admit thousands of dead.
[00:02:36.118 --> 00:02:38.440]  But again, it's not a war.
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:47.106]  It is a peace action by the Nobel Peace Laureate, Supreme Leader, dear gracious leader, Obama.
[00:02:47.106 --> 00:02:51.049]  Continuing with these reports after the break,
[00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.472]  1,300 dead in an attack on Tripoli, government spokesman at the French News Agency.
[00:02:59.472 --> 00:03:06.554]  Also, the battle for Libya is almost over, as is the battle for its 144 tons of gold.
[00:03:06.554 --> 00:03:09.674]  That's why Chavez is getting his gold out of England and other places.
[00:03:09.674 --> 00:03:13.515]  You know they're about to put sanctions on them and seize those goodies.
[00:03:13.515 --> 00:03:17.316]  Also, NATO loots Libyan gold as Tripoli falls.
[00:03:17.316 --> 00:03:21.238]  That's just some of the reports we have there.
[00:03:21.238 --> 00:03:22.058]  And now the
[00:03:23.138 --> 00:03:34.964]  Eastern-backed Al-Qaeda groups are going to have quite an orgy of humanitarian assistance inside Libya.
[00:03:34.964 --> 00:03:40.207]  And the country, of course, will be gutted end-to-end, completely de-industrialized.
[00:03:40.207 --> 00:03:48.711]  And the once-prosperous nation, in the next few years, you'll see starvation lines and people begging UNICEF for food.
[00:03:48.711 --> 00:03:51.593]  They'll be given the food as long as they take the special
[00:03:52.153 --> 00:03:52.293]  Yeah.
[00:04:12.754 --> 00:04:19.620]  He's being taken out to put something even worse in and he was trying to get Africa with its own currency.
[00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.182]  He was trying to industrialize Africa.
[00:04:22.182 --> 00:04:25.604]  And at the same time, Gaddafi
[00:04:26.852 --> 00:04:31.494]  Of course, was sitting on top of all of that gold that the establishment wanted.
[00:04:31.494 --> 00:04:41.358]  And Gaddafi was foolish enough seven years ago to make a deal with the West and start investing the country's money with Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and others.
[00:04:41.358 --> 00:04:49.222]  And once he started democratizing the country, that allowed Western intelligence agencies to come in and fully scope things out.
[00:04:49.222 --> 00:04:52.083]  So their legendary attack dog, Al-Qaeda, who
[00:04:52.523 --> 00:04:55.312]  Took down the Serbs and took down the Russians.
[00:04:55.312 --> 00:04:56.696]  Could be loosed.
[00:04:56.696 --> 00:04:57.478]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:57.478 --> 00:04:58.903]  Alcantara's done another great job.
[00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.634]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:05:05.634 --> 00:05:08.878]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:05:08.878 --> 00:05:13.663]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:05:13.663 --> 00:05:20.070]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.313]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:05:22.833 --> 00:05:23.133]  Tim Geithner?
[00:05:23.133 --> 00:05:23.453]  Bernanke?
[00:05:23.453 --> 00:05:23.974]  They're arsonists!
[00:05:23.974 --> 00:05:24.774]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:05:24.774 --> 00:05:26.415]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:05:41.741 --> 00:05:49.029]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:58.219]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.980]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:08.282]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:06:08.282 --> 00:06:09.822]  Saving means to make money.
[00:06:09.822 --> 00:06:18.605]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:06:19.345 --> 00:06:26.888]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:06:26.888 --> 00:06:34.891]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:06:34.891 --> 00:06:40.112]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[00:06:40.112 --> 00:06:42.273]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:06:45.054 --> 00:06:48.259]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:50.643]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:06:50.643 --> 00:06:52.767]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[00:06:59.738 --> 00:07:04.282]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:07:04.282 --> 00:07:05.202]  Number one.
[00:07:05.202 --> 00:07:08.625]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:07:08.625 --> 00:07:09.486]  Number two.
[00:07:09.486 --> 00:07:14.369]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:07:14.369 --> 00:07:15.110]  It's true.
[00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:19.994]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:07:19.994 --> 00:07:20.814]  Number three.
[00:07:20.814 --> 00:07:24.397]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:07:24.397 --> 00:07:28.100]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:29.101]  Number 4.
[00:07:29.101 --> 00:07:31.864]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:07:31.864 --> 00:07:35.548]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:07:35.548 --> 00:07:36.328]  Number 5.
[00:07:36.328 --> 00:07:40.473]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:07:40.473 --> 00:07:45.238]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:07:45.518 --> 00:07:49.700]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:51.481]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:51.481 --> 00:07:53.742]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:07:53.742 --> 00:07:56.344]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:07:56.344 --> 00:08:03.587]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:03.587 --> 00:08:06.369]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:14.343 --> 00:08:17.651]  It is Monday, the 22nd day of August, 2011.
[00:08:21.325 --> 00:08:30.393]  Gerald Cilente is coming up at the bottom of the next hour to break down the current developments in the economy and his future predictions on where it is going.
[00:08:30.393 --> 00:08:35.157]  We'll also get his take on other geopolitical trends like the situation in Libya.
[00:08:35.157 --> 00:08:48.789]  In the last 30 minutes of the broadcast today, Webster Griffin Tarpley, historian and, of course, economist, who traveled and spent several weeks a month or so ago in Libya, will be joining us to break down the latest developments there.
[00:08:50.152 --> 00:08:54.273]  Also, coming up later, I covered some of this yesterday on the Sunday broadcast.
[00:08:54.273 --> 00:08:55.494]  I want to get more into it.
[00:08:55.494 --> 00:08:59.495]  Ron Paul, they're setting the stage for violence in this country.
[00:08:59.495 --> 00:09:12.059]  That's what he said when he was asked by a reporter, are you concerned about the National Emergency Centers Establishment Act that sets up FEMA camps, or basically just openly legalizes them and funds them to a greater extent.
[00:09:12.059 --> 00:09:14.020]  They're admittedly there and in place.
[00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:17.000]  According to the Houston Chronicle and other publications.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.721]  And Ron Paul said, yeah, that's their goal.
[00:09:18.721 --> 00:09:21.301]  They're setting up the stage for violence in this country.
[00:09:21.301 --> 00:09:24.722]  No doubt about it, responded Ron Paul.
[00:09:24.722 --> 00:09:29.082]  So we're going to be going over some of that today.
[00:09:29.082 --> 00:09:30.503]  Also, the economic news.
[00:09:30.503 --> 00:09:31.903]  Let me hit that first.
[00:09:31.903 --> 00:09:39.144]  Social Security disability on the verge of insolvency, Associated Press is reporting.
[00:09:39.144 --> 00:09:42.865]  Do you have any idea how many people are on Social Security disability?
[00:09:44.145 --> 00:09:50.149]  How many families are already basically moving in together but trying to survive and can't even pay for gas money?
[00:09:50.149 --> 00:09:51.770]  This is the working poor.
[00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:56.513]  How many people that are on the verge of eating dog food already are?
[00:09:56.513 --> 00:10:01.876]  Because there hasn't been a cost of living COLA increase in Social Security in two years.
[00:10:01.876 --> 00:10:04.057]  They're talking about doing it for a third and fourth year.
[00:10:04.057 --> 00:10:09.241]  Do you have any idea what dollar devaluation means to this country?
[00:10:09.241 --> 00:10:12.102]  A number of delinquent mortgages is on the rise again.
[00:10:13.163 --> 00:10:14.804]  That's out of CNBC.
[00:10:14.804 --> 00:10:17.887]  Gold advances to record as platinum climbs.
[00:10:17.887 --> 00:10:24.792]  Gold came just shy of $1,900 an ounce earlier in the day.
[00:10:24.792 --> 00:10:27.134]  We're going to continue to track that.
[00:10:27.134 --> 00:10:38.544]  Wall Street aristocracy got $1.2 trillion in secret Fed loans at 0% or less and then, of course, loaned it back to the public at exorbitant prices or just sat on it.
[00:10:39.224 --> 00:10:41.925]  Being paid by the government interest for holding it.
[00:10:41.925 --> 00:10:44.106]  You can't make that up.
[00:10:44.106 --> 00:10:46.807]  Continuing, stocks jump over 1%.
[00:10:46.807 --> 00:10:49.488]  All S&P sectors higher.
[00:10:49.488 --> 00:10:53.030]  That was earlier in the day before it began dropping again.
[00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:57.452]  In Baltimore, homes are selling for $10,000 and less.
[00:10:57.452 --> 00:11:00.313]  Baltimore Sun is reporting.
[00:11:00.313 --> 00:11:05.495]  The Greeks, of course, gave in to the banksters and signed their country's resources over to them.
[00:11:05.495 --> 00:11:07.856]  So now they're being brought into the next level of debt.
[00:11:08.997 --> 00:11:21.892]  As the four largest banks agreed to take up a 50 million euro convertible bond to help recapitalize Proton Bank, a smaller lender.
[00:11:21.892 --> 00:11:23.394]  So that slide is continuing.
[00:11:24.595 --> 00:11:31.302]  New reality for many baby boomers will be to work as wage slaves until they drop dead.
[00:11:31.302 --> 00:11:35.966]  They're going to push retirement past the average age of death, 76.
[00:11:35.966 --> 00:11:49.418]  Continuing, Wall Street again is in the news calling for even more banker bailouts and QE3, which will only accelerate the demise of the dollar.
[00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:56.546]  Again, there's more expectation of continued private Federal Reserve, quote, stimulus.
[00:11:56.546 --> 00:12:01.452]  They're only stimulating their own sectors of the economy.
[00:12:02.813 --> 00:12:11.715]  That is all coming up as well, and I want to open the phones up on any issue, any news item, anything you'd like to talk about.
[00:12:11.715 --> 00:12:15.296]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:12:15.296 --> 00:12:15.776]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:12:15.776 --> 00:12:25.859]  Now, you can call in with any subject you want to raise, but I'm going to try to move on to the next caller quickly.
[00:12:25.859 --> 00:12:30.160]  I've done a little bit better job as of late, but still, I wouldn't even call it passable.
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:35.324]  The number of calls we go to and I enjoy your calls.
[00:12:35.324 --> 00:12:36.205]  I like your calls.
[00:12:36.205 --> 00:12:44.351]  I like the different directions you take us in and so I will attempt to take more calls in the future including today 800-259-9031.
[00:12:44.351 --> 00:12:53.158]  I would ask listeners though to specifically at least comment on some of the big topics we're raising here.
[00:12:53.158 --> 00:12:54.439]  The fact that we're in a depression.
[00:12:55.270 --> 00:13:16.560]  The fact that Europe is being taken over now by a private banking consortium as part of the establishment of a Bank of the World, that all of this has been engineered, and that after six months of Western-backed, Al-Qaeda-driven, the core is Al-Qaeda, in fact the majority are admitted Al-Qaeda,
[00:13:18.163 --> 00:13:26.332]  That they have now reportedly taken over most of the city of Tripoli, and there's ongoing fighting happening right now.
[00:13:26.332 --> 00:13:27.894]  Qaddafi's disappeared.
[00:13:27.894 --> 00:13:31.738]  His sons have reportedly been captured, but we've heard that before.
[00:13:31.738 --> 00:13:37.285]  But there's no doubt there are uprisings in Tripoli and that Qaddafi is on his way out.
[00:13:37.645 --> 00:13:48.473]  Now we've heard five or six times that he'd gone to Venezuela, or Tunisia, or that he had fallen, or that the rebels had taken Tripoli, but it appears this time it may actually be true.
[00:13:48.473 --> 00:13:51.896]  We saw Obama say that we'd be there days, not weeks.
[00:13:51.896 --> 00:13:53.277]  That was four and a half months ago.
[00:13:55.049 --> 00:14:05.574]  And so I was very reticent in the last two days as they announced that the rebels were at the gates, but it appears that at least a part of this is true.
[00:14:05.574 --> 00:14:14.879]  Now, it'd be one thing if they went in and had elections and the people of Libya were allowed to move forward into the future.
[00:14:14.879 --> 00:14:17.300]  The problem is they had a British-backed
[00:14:19.358 --> 00:14:26.943]  Monarchy dictatorship there before Qaddafi staged his coup 40 years ago.
[00:14:26.943 --> 00:14:30.405]  And that regime brutally kept the tribes from killing each other.
[00:14:30.405 --> 00:14:35.068]  The different, I don't know, there's more than five different tribes in the region.
[00:14:35.068 --> 00:14:37.609]  Three of the tribes were loyal to Qaddafi.
[00:14:37.609 --> 00:14:46.635]  The other two groups out of Eastern Libya or more Saudi Arabian and what Yemen backed
[00:14:48.528 --> 00:14:55.717]  And now they have been going into every town and city they've taken and just murdering people in mass.
[00:14:55.717 --> 00:14:58.320]  Hanging people from lampposts.
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:08.172]  Anybody they see that's black, that's associated with people not of Arab descent.
[00:15:09.824 --> 00:15:16.011]  And so it goes back to that old ancient bigotry of some of the Arabs in the region in the black slave trade.
[00:15:16.011 --> 00:15:18.353]  And so they're just being killed on the spot.
[00:15:18.353 --> 00:15:21.356]  And there's no doubt this has been a humanitarian mega disaster.
[00:15:22.524 --> 00:15:26.106]  And that the globalists want chaos and carnage.
[00:15:26.106 --> 00:15:29.027]  They'll get control of the oil fields and guard them.
[00:15:29.027 --> 00:15:32.068]  They'll get control of the refineries and guard them.
[00:15:32.068 --> 00:15:38.871]  And we'll shut off the supply to a great extent, both to the Libyans and to Europe.
[00:15:38.871 --> 00:15:42.013]  And you think, well wait, Europe wants to go in, NATO wants to go in to get that oil.
[00:15:42.013 --> 00:15:43.153]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:15:43.153 --> 00:15:44.194]  There's too much oil.
[00:15:44.194 --> 00:15:50.716]  That's why our own government won't let us have 90 plus percent of the oil out of Alaska, even though they've got the fields developed since the 1980s.
[00:15:52.782 --> 00:15:57.316]  It's about artificial scarcity in the globalist monopoly game.
[00:15:58.171 --> 00:16:04.576]  They artificially make light bulbs where they break in a few months when they could last 50 years.
[00:16:04.576 --> 00:16:10.141]  They artificially went in and bought up most of the smaller refineries in the U.S.
[00:16:10.141 --> 00:16:17.427]  in the 90s to create a bottleneck so that even if you could deliver oil, you can't get it refined.
[00:16:17.427 --> 00:16:24.033]  AP sued in 2000 and got the documents of the big oil companies meeting in secret.
[00:16:25.323 --> 00:16:29.466]  In 1996, to buy up, which they did do, the refineries in the U.S.
[00:16:29.466 --> 00:16:31.648]  that they don't own, and to shut them down.
[00:16:31.648 --> 00:16:33.449]  Then they say, oh, it's the environmentalists.
[00:16:33.449 --> 00:16:37.873]  They're keeping us from being able to open new refineries.
[00:16:37.873 --> 00:16:39.734]  Pure bull.
[00:16:39.734 --> 00:16:48.281]  Oh, they'll have some hippies stand out front of a refinery and call for it to be shut down, and then the hippies wonder why it's been shut down and think they have all this power.
[00:16:52.416 --> 00:16:54.177]  Oh, it's really funny actually.
[00:16:54.177 --> 00:17:01.262]  And boy, people think the hippies are keeping the people that run our country from opening up all those oil fields.
[00:17:01.262 --> 00:17:07.947]  The folks that have hijacked our nation invade countries and kill over a million people to shut off the oil.
[00:17:07.947 --> 00:17:08.568]  A.K.A.
[00:17:08.568 --> 00:17:09.749]  Iraq.
[00:17:09.749 --> 00:17:14.212]  Production way down since the liberation eight years ago.
[00:17:14.212 --> 00:17:17.754]  This is what it's all about, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:17.754 --> 00:17:19.956]  This is what it's all about.
[00:17:21.121 --> 00:17:30.035]  They could create a half million jobs, the studies show, in just a few months if they opened up drilling in Alaska and opened it up in many other areas on public lands.
[00:17:30.035 --> 00:17:32.258]  But they're not going to do it.
[00:17:32.258 --> 00:17:35.283]  If they do, it'll be to a limited token extent.
[00:17:36.528 --> 00:17:41.869]  And so now the true mass murder de-industrialization of Libya can start.
[00:17:41.869 --> 00:17:49.890]  There will be ongoing bombings and civil wars and tit-for-tat tribal killings basically forever now.
[00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:55.091]  And I predict that the West in the next two to five years will have to invade.
[00:17:55.091 --> 00:17:58.932]  And notice they're now announcing, oh, the US forces will now come in to help.
[00:17:58.932 --> 00:18:00.812]  NATO forces will now come in to help.
[00:18:00.812 --> 00:18:02.333]  The air cover is going to continue.
[00:18:02.333 --> 00:18:03.393]  Of course it's going to continue.
[00:18:04.053 --> 00:18:11.235]  The webbles, as they call themselves, the webbles, the wascally webbles, have been killing each other from the start.
[00:18:11.235 --> 00:18:21.378]  That's why for six months they couldn't ever get any momentum until the last couple months when US, British, French, and other special forces poured in.
[00:18:23.519 --> 00:18:25.200]  And all the different videos of U.S.
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:35.506]  and other troops and mercenaries on the front lines running the high-tech weapon systems finally did roll back Qaddafi's forces up to Tripoli.
[00:18:35.506 --> 00:18:38.267]  Then they'd already been able to infiltrate Tripoli.
[00:18:38.267 --> 00:18:42.910]  The last seven years of Qaddafi trying to be friendly to the West, they had all their sleeper cells there.
[00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:50.233]  That unleashed total havoc 48 hours ago and started bombing and blowing things up and attacking TV stations.
[00:18:50.233 --> 00:18:55.034]  And so now they're just going to mop people up and go around and exterminate folks.
[00:18:55.034 --> 00:19:00.416]  Part of the kinetic military action, non-military action, the peace action.
[00:19:00.416 --> 00:19:05.238]  And it's now admitted that they've got Western-backed forces in Syria.
[00:19:05.238 --> 00:19:10.220]  And that liberation will go on forever, if need be, until Assad falls.
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.581]  Remember, they've already got America.
[00:19:14.581 --> 00:19:22.005]  It was all over the Texas newspapers, Fort Worth Star-Telegram, by the way, speaking of energy monopolies.
[00:19:22.005 --> 00:19:32.791]  That the rolling blackouts have been because of the last six, seven years, the EPA not letting new plants open, shutting down other plants.
[00:19:34.127 --> 00:19:40.128]  Now Obama has accelerated that in that they're saying, get ready for double prices in the next two years for your power.
[00:19:40.128 --> 00:19:41.829]  It's already gone up substantively.
[00:19:41.829 --> 00:19:42.929]  And rolling blackouts.
[00:19:42.929 --> 00:19:47.310]  We're going to live just like they live in Iraq, just like they're going to be living in Libya.
[00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:52.111]  This is the New World Order, Soviet-Romanian style system.
[00:19:52.111 --> 00:19:54.011]  NATO hands terrorists who killed U.S.
[00:19:54.011 --> 00:19:55.791]  troops control of Libya.
[00:19:55.791 --> 00:19:57.492]  That is coming up.
[00:19:57.492 --> 00:19:58.412]  And your phone call.
[00:19:58.412 --> 00:19:58.932]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.656 --> 00:20:07.383]  Our rights as individuals to freely purchase dietary supplements over the counter are under constant attack.
[00:20:07.383 --> 00:20:11.547]  The globalists want to ban all supplements formulated after 1994.
[00:20:11.547 --> 00:20:17.294]  Governments are hoarding raw materials, affecting our ability to purchase these products at a reasonable price.
[00:20:17.294 --> 00:20:22.920]  Even organic foods are stripped of nutrients due to overuse of soil and compromised growing conditions.
[00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:29.823]  Storable foods are essential, but you also need to make sure you have the nutrients you need to stay healthy during emergencies.
[00:20:29.823 --> 00:20:37.527]  Go to SurvivalRx.com today and see the amazing line of storable supplements they have to protect the ones you love.
[00:20:37.527 --> 00:20:42.989]  The owners of SurvivalRx.com have been in sports nutrition for over a decade.
[00:20:43.149 --> 00:20:43.529]  We're good to go.
[00:21:00.433 --> 00:21:06.824]  What you're about to hear are the real experiences of women over 40 who finally lost weight by becoming hormonally balanced again.
[00:21:06.824 --> 00:21:07.485]  I lost 20 pounds.
[00:21:07.485 --> 00:21:08.286]  I lost 40 pounds.
[00:21:08.286 --> 00:21:09.748]  I lost 55 pounds.
[00:21:09.748 --> 00:21:11.491]  I went from a size 14 to a size 8.
[00:21:15.143 --> 00:21:22.005]  Their secret is Amberin, the revolutionary formula for women over 40 that balances hormones naturally.
[00:21:22.005 --> 00:21:25.667]  The leading cause of weight gain over 40 is hormonal imbalance.
[00:21:25.667 --> 00:21:29.748]  Until you balance your hormones, losing weight can be practically impossible.
[00:21:29.748 --> 00:21:36.670]  But Amberin restores hormonal balance naturally, so the weight can just fall right off, even that stubborn belly fat.
[00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:44.513]  Plus, Amberin eliminates other symptoms of hormonal aging, like hot flashes, night sweats, low libido, difficulty concentrating, and more.

[00:21:51.841 --> 00:21:51.901]  1-800-737-9107.
[00:22:01.132 --> 00:22:05.816]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[00:22:05.816 --> 00:22:12.261]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[00:22:12.261 --> 00:22:14.523]  Number one, study the past.
[00:22:14.523 --> 00:22:16.925]  History really does repeat itself.
[00:22:16.925 --> 00:22:20.647]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[00:22:21.758 --> 00:22:24.861]  Number three, take decisive action.
[00:22:24.861 --> 00:22:28.704]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[00:22:28.704 --> 00:22:33.748]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[00:22:33.748 --> 00:22:37.171]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[00:22:37.751 --> 00:22:41.155]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[00:22:41.155 --> 00:22:45.660]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:50.585]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[00:22:50.585 --> 00:22:55.211]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:22:55.211 --> 00:22:57.353]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:22:59.403 --> 00:23:05.347]  HempUSA.org has moved and expanded its operations for faster worldwide shipping.
[00:23:05.347 --> 00:23:10.871]  Our product line has grown from 5 to nearly 100 items in less than 5 years.

[00:23:28.542 --> 00:23:37.868]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:23:37.868 --> 00:23:38.649]  This capitalism?
[00:23:38.649 --> 00:23:44.933]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:23:44.933 --> 00:23:45.794]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:23:45.794 --> 00:23:49.056]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[00:23:49.056 --> 00:23:49.856]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[00:23:49.856 --> 00:23:51.077]  It's time to understand the system.
[00:23:51.077 --> 00:23:51.577]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:23:51.577 --> 00:23:51.858]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:24:01.924 --> 00:24:02.464]  We're done.
[00:24:23.203 --> 00:24:37.129]  It was staggering for me when 9-11 took place to watch the media tell us how Al Qaeda was this enemy and that the government had no idea that they had a plan to attack us.
[00:24:37.129 --> 00:24:42.671]  I knew they'd been used and created to attack the Russians in Afghanistan.
[00:24:42.671 --> 00:24:43.372]  I knew that
[00:24:44.502 --> 00:25:01.534]  They had been used to attack the Serbs in Kosovo, and when the Serbs resisted that attack, that NATO had bombed Belgrade into the Stone Age, bombing their power plants, their water treatment, their television stations with depleted uranium weapons.
[00:25:01.534 --> 00:25:08.059]  Now, a decade later, their birth defects have more than tripled in those cities that were bombed.
[00:25:08.059 --> 00:25:09.540]  These are ruthless globalists.
[00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:19.101]  And to see the rebel commander brag to the Washington Post and others that, yes, I've killed Americans in Iraq.
[00:25:19.101 --> 00:25:21.804]  And now I only, quote, hate the Americans 50%.
[00:25:24.994 --> 00:25:25.794]  That's right.
[00:25:25.794 --> 00:25:30.536]  The groups out of Saudi Arabia and other areas that are in Libya under NATO and U.S.
[00:25:30.536 --> 00:25:35.177]  command on record are real Al-Qaeda.
[00:25:35.177 --> 00:25:40.859]  Real fighters who go all over the world fighting for their Islamic Jihad.
[00:25:40.859 --> 00:25:46.941]  And they wanted to get rid of Muammar Gaddafi because he was a socialist and secular.
[00:25:46.941 --> 00:25:49.782]  He paid lip service to Islam.
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:26:02.825]  He did obviously keep a lot of money for himself and was corrupt, but in the standards of dictators, did build up the country, did have a welfare state, and that's all bye-bye now.
[00:26:02.825 --> 00:26:07.267]  Libya is going to be driven into the Stone Age, just as America is.
[00:26:08.297 --> 00:26:12.920]  In fact, there's a new article out that's so important that we need to get out to everyone.
[00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:17.923]  It just got published at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:26:17.923 --> 00:26:21.146]  I worked on this report with Paul Watson this morning.
[00:26:21.146 --> 00:26:26.569]  Obama hits struggling Americans with energy rate hikes.
[00:26:26.569 --> 00:26:31.212]  And as I said, Drudge ran the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Washington Post, and others.
[00:26:32.699 --> 00:26:44.645]  Yesterday, where they admitted that yes, we're already having blackouts when it gets cold or gets hot and there's high energy demands because of the last six years of policies under Bush and now under Obama.
[00:26:44.645 --> 00:26:47.246]  And now they're announcing massive plant closures.
[00:26:47.246 --> 00:26:51.588]  These are plants that nothing comes out of them but water vapor and carbon dioxide.
[00:26:51.588 --> 00:26:57.111]  But they've listed at the EPA carbon dioxide as a toxic waste.
[00:26:57.111 --> 00:26:58.972]  Now remember, you exhale carbon dioxide.
[00:27:00.083 --> 00:27:05.385]  Plants then engage in photosynthesis with it and the sun.
[00:27:05.385 --> 00:27:06.585]  It's part of the carbon cycle.
[00:27:06.585 --> 00:27:07.946]  It's part of our atmosphere.
[00:27:07.946 --> 00:27:10.506]  It's part of the symbiotic relationship.
[00:27:10.506 --> 00:27:19.729]  But that has been named as toxic and that's why they're calling for carbon taxes and carbon credits and a carbon allotment, a ration, for every man, woman and child.
[00:27:19.729 --> 00:27:23.551]  Congress would not pass this law two years ago when Obama brought it forward.
[00:27:23.551 --> 00:27:24.971]  First piece of legislation.
[00:27:24.971 --> 00:27:27.072]  He simply said, I'll just have the EPA do it.
[00:27:27.898 --> 00:27:35.004]  Just like they couldn't get Congress to pass tax hikes, they just got rid of Congress being able to bring bills forward.
[00:27:35.004 --> 00:27:37.726]  And they now have a super-Congress that does that.
[00:27:37.726 --> 00:27:42.529]  And if the Congress doesn't pass their bills, they just go ahead and pass whatever the super-Congress wanted.
[00:27:42.529 --> 00:27:49.235]  They say, we've created this package, up or down vote, and if you say no, they just implement the policies.
[00:27:49.235 --> 00:27:50.215]  That's a dictatorship.
[00:27:51.212 --> 00:27:53.052]  of this oligarchy.
[00:27:53.052 --> 00:27:55.693]  I mean, we're in incredible times.
[00:27:55.693 --> 00:28:02.494]  Gun control without laws now being implemented by the ATF.
[00:28:02.494 --> 00:28:05.315]  Finally, they did something good for a change.
[00:28:05.315 --> 00:28:08.836]  We'll see if they lose the case on purpose.
[00:28:08.836 --> 00:28:15.997]  But finally, even the so-called Second Amendment organization
[00:28:18.735 --> 00:28:19.115]  Thank you.
[00:28:40.501 --> 00:29:03.080]  Gun Control Executive Wand, Wars Executive Wand, Super Congress Executive Wand, Carbon Taxes Executive Wand, Waivers to Insiders on Healthcare Laws to give him money, Campaign Contributions, Magic Executive Wand, and now Energy Rate Increases.
[00:29:04.073 --> 00:29:09.656]  But the few companies that are allowed to operate, like General Electric, who got the waiver in February, they got the waiver.
[00:29:09.656 --> 00:29:16.960]  And it turns out their former executives at the EPA and the White House wrote the new regulations.
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:17.920]  They wrote them.
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:21.102]  Just like Big Agra last year wrote the Food Safety Act.
[00:29:22.199 --> 00:29:23.500]  I mean, why not?
[00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:37.948]  If we don't have a government that's constitutional and out of control, you don't think big corporations are going to come in and pay them to pass legislation or put executive orders in place to shut down their competition?
[00:29:37.948 --> 00:29:39.088]  Absolutely.
[00:29:39.088 --> 00:29:41.790]  And the government's getting away with all of it.
[00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:42.770]  So what's going to happen?
[00:29:42.770 --> 00:29:43.851]  Even more.

[00:30:12.707 --> 00:30:19.510]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.

[00:33:16.077 --> 00:33:27.380]  When you're crowned king nothing like Muammar Gaddafi.
[00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:33.802]  Seven years ago he made public deals with George W. Bush and the West.
[00:33:33.802 --> 00:33:35.783]  He let the West in for investment.
[00:33:37.259 --> 00:33:39.681]  Invested the country's money with the bankers.
[00:33:39.681 --> 00:33:46.765]  They have now publicly stolen more than $70 billion of the Libyan people's investment.
[00:33:46.765 --> 00:33:52.309]  They are going after the 144 tons of gold, just like the U.S.
[00:33:52.309 --> 00:34:00.695]  military on record went in with foreign contractors and robbed every one of the museums in Baghdad.
[00:34:00.695 --> 00:34:02.796]  And then no one knows where it all went.
[00:34:02.796 --> 00:34:06.799]  This is just outright, total industrialized looting.
[00:34:07.999 --> 00:34:11.361]  And our military's having their pension funds looted.
[00:34:11.361 --> 00:34:16.824]  It is being announced they're looking at cutting military retirements by 50%.
[00:34:16.824 --> 00:34:28.070]  Those that serve 20 or more years and have a contract with the government, they're going to cut what you're paid and devalue the rest of it via hyperinflation.
[00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:30.211]  What, did you think you could join the U.S.
[00:34:30.211 --> 00:34:32.392]  military and ship heroin out of Vietnam?
[00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:34.590]  Did you think you'd join the U.S.
[00:34:34.590 --> 00:34:39.612]  military and go down to Colombia and kill the FARC to consolidate the cocaine?
[00:34:39.612 --> 00:34:51.276]  What, you think you'd train Los Zetas, 10,000 plus over the last decade, and then send them down to Mexico to try to knock out the cartels and that you would then ever get your pension fund too?
[00:34:51.276 --> 00:34:58.999]  Of course, the average military person didn't even get any of the drug money and isn't aware of it and is compartmentalized.
[00:34:58.999 --> 00:35:01.540]  But we have a lawless criminal government.
[00:35:02.659 --> 00:35:08.823]  Completely lawless, completely criminal, and they're now engaging in bolder and bolder activities.
[00:35:08.823 --> 00:35:16.687]  I'd say the type of corruption we saw under George Herbert Walker Bush, a 3.5 on the Richter scale.
[00:35:16.687 --> 00:35:19.549]  It was going on, but they were trying to keep it hidden.
[00:35:19.549 --> 00:35:22.871]  Under Bill Clinton, a 5 on the Richter scale.
[00:35:22.871 --> 00:35:26.674]  Under George W. Bush, a 7 on the Richter scale.
[00:35:26.674 --> 00:35:28.435]  Under Obama, it's a whopping 10.
[00:35:30.066 --> 00:35:33.589]  Remember, it grows exponentially on the Richter scale.
[00:35:33.589 --> 00:35:37.052]  I mean, now he's just, I don't need Congress for war.
[00:35:37.052 --> 00:35:40.695]  I don't need Congress for UN Agenda 21 carbon taxes.
[00:35:40.695 --> 00:35:43.958]  I'm going to deploy the military under the Rockefeller Foundation.
[00:35:43.958 --> 00:35:53.326]  That's in the news yesterday in the rural council run by Homeland Security and the Pentagon, the Pentagon in your town.
[00:35:54.454 --> 00:35:58.396]  With a local office to help you with loans and things.
[00:35:58.396 --> 00:36:02.519]  Ooh, boy, we are going under Soviet control.
[00:36:02.519 --> 00:36:05.800]  You've really got to look at the Soviet model and realize this is it.
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:09.142]  We are going under a Sovietization system.
[00:36:09.142 --> 00:36:12.024]  You're like, but I thought it's big banks running it.
[00:36:12.024 --> 00:36:15.046]  The profits are private.
[00:36:15.046 --> 00:36:16.867]  The losses are public.
[00:36:17.867 --> 00:36:19.528]  It all goes on our back.
[00:36:19.528 --> 00:36:24.409]  They're all offshore, exempt from all their taxes, exempt from all their regulations.
[00:36:24.409 --> 00:36:35.073]  That's why you see all the big mega-rich calling for higher taxes and telling the poor, get them rich people, making over $125,000 individually, quarter mill collectively with a man and woman.
[00:36:35.073 --> 00:36:35.853]  Get them!
[00:36:35.853 --> 00:36:36.233]  Get them!
[00:36:36.233 --> 00:36:37.174]  They're the rich!
[00:36:37.174 --> 00:36:42.756]  And you see the hordes of people on welfare and the rest of it saying, my check isn't buying anything anymore.
[00:36:42.756 --> 00:36:43.676]  Okay, raise it!
[00:36:44.116 --> 00:36:48.117]  And they're like, good, we've got half the public on the gravy train.
[00:36:48.117 --> 00:36:52.178]  They're gonna tear the middle class to pieces while we sit offshore.
[00:36:52.178 --> 00:37:03.601]  And when the vets get mad, and the cops try to come to take their house for repossession, and the vets fight back, we're gonna call them Al-Qaeda.
[00:37:03.601 --> 00:37:07.322]  They've got it all figured out in their social engineering.
[00:37:07.322 --> 00:37:08.923]  I can't tell you, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:13.579]  How many veterans I've talked to and that my family's talked to?
[00:37:14.778 --> 00:37:18.760]  My parents were in Wyoming and Montana for a week and a half visiting friends.
[00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:20.080]  They went on a road trip.
[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:21.160]  And my dad got back.
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:26.483]  They didn't tell anybody that they were Alex Jones' parents.
[00:37:26.483 --> 00:37:39.568]  And every restaurant, every house they went to, every rancher they talked to, everybody they met on top of mountaintop hiking, young and old, Native American, white, didn't matter, said, we know the New World Order's here.
[00:37:39.568 --> 00:37:40.488]  We're just waiting.
[00:37:42.262 --> 00:37:43.762]  And my parents just said it was everywhere.
[00:37:43.762 --> 00:37:51.884]  It was just open, everywhere you went, at gas stations, you name it, people basically saying, we're ready, we're ready, we're ready to rock.
[00:37:51.884 --> 00:37:55.605]  And that's why Chuck Baldwin moved up there.
[00:37:55.605 --> 00:37:59.886]  And he said, it's just absolute, totally awake.
[00:37:59.886 --> 00:38:04.807]  I mean, I've been in Wyoming and Montana the last two years, and I can't walk down the street.
[00:38:04.807 --> 00:38:08.548]  I mean, I can't walk down the street in Austin, Texas, without folks pulling over and shaking my hand.
[00:38:08.548 --> 00:38:10.388]  But there, it's everyone, basically.
[00:38:11.530 --> 00:38:17.135]  I mean, Aaron and others who went with me were just blown away.
[00:38:17.135 --> 00:38:22.920]  We'd be walking down the street at night in little bitty towns and people would pop out of doorways, Alex Jones, I recognize your voice!
[00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:23.840]  We're gonna defeat them!
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:25.622]  Come in the restaurant, I wanna buy you a beer!
[00:38:25.622 --> 00:38:32.107]  I mean, it's just, so let me tell ya, the globalists know who the terrorists are.
[00:38:32.107 --> 00:38:36.571]  It's real Americans who understand who the financial terrorists are.
[00:38:36.571 --> 00:38:38.773]  You are the terrorist, and they know they're the terrorist.
[00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:41.121]  They understand.
[00:38:41.121 --> 00:38:45.446]  Anybody who actually knows what America is really all about is a terrorist.
[00:38:46.291 --> 00:38:59.340]  You look at the government training manuals, returning veterans, gun owners, in the fetters, Ron Paul supporters, Bob Barr supporters, Libertarian Party supporters, land rights activists.
[00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:01.901]  By the way, I was driving in and I forgot to pull this up.
[00:39:01.901 --> 00:39:03.963]  He was reading the news article.
[00:39:03.963 --> 00:39:06.845]  The FDA is going after vitamin C now.
[00:39:06.845 --> 00:39:08.406]  Ben Fuchs was reading the articles.
[00:39:08.406 --> 00:39:09.346]  Will you guys type in
[00:39:12.571 --> 00:39:15.972]  Food and Drug Administration moves to restrict or ban.
[00:39:15.972 --> 00:39:17.052]  He was reading two different articles.
[00:39:17.052 --> 00:39:21.894]  One article was restrict vitamin C, the other was ban vitamin C over the counter.
[00:39:21.894 --> 00:39:24.694]  And I know that's already starting in Europe under Codex Alimentarius.
[00:39:24.694 --> 00:39:34.377]  I've got articles here where they're arresting people all over the United States now from DC to Washington State.
[00:39:34.377 --> 00:39:37.118]  Those are just the two articles today when you try to sell lemonade.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.402]  They don't just fine you now if children come out and sell lemonade.
[00:39:43.402 --> 00:39:48.505]  They're actually fining and threatening to arrest Girl Scouts selling cookies now.
[00:39:48.505 --> 00:39:50.966]  Or Girl Scout popcorn.
[00:39:50.966 --> 00:39:53.808]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, it is on.
[00:39:53.808 --> 00:40:01.892]  They're letting us know, you live in a Soviet America where the book is thrown at average law-abiding citizens and criminals are above the law.
[00:40:01.892 --> 00:40:05.855]  It is so hardcore.
[00:40:05.855 --> 00:40:07.956]  It is so hardcore.
[00:40:09.347 --> 00:40:10.870]  Later we'll pull this video up and play it.
[00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:16.257]  Children defy police in Washington, purchase lemonade in the capital city and are arrested.
[00:40:17.361 --> 00:40:23.343]  It's incredible footage of them being threatened, the police acting like they're narcotics traffickers.
[00:40:23.343 --> 00:40:25.084]  And then meanwhile, it's well known.
[00:40:25.084 --> 00:40:29.345]  We had Serpico on, Frank Serpico, the legendary New York narcotics detective.
[00:40:29.345 --> 00:40:38.648]  And I said, around the time you got shot in the face and run out of there, I've read 75% of the detectives were later proven on the take.
[00:40:38.648 --> 00:40:40.208]  And he said, well, in my group, it was 100%.
[00:40:43.324 --> 00:40:44.805]  100%.
[00:40:44.805 --> 00:40:51.086]  Ladies and gentlemen, the town I grew up in, Rockwall, I was not even a druggie.
[00:40:51.086 --> 00:40:52.707]  I was a jock.
[00:40:52.707 --> 00:40:54.547]  And I would go to parties.
[00:40:54.547 --> 00:40:58.528]  And when I was 12 years old, it started.
[00:40:58.528 --> 00:41:02.790]  Playing baseball down the street.
[00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:04.610]  One of my friends invites me over.
[00:41:04.610 --> 00:41:06.491]  His older brother's in high school.
[00:41:06.491 --> 00:41:11.552]  Cop shows up in uniform, goes in the house, sells him drugs to distribute.
[00:41:13.035 --> 00:41:25.159]  And I'll never forget my buddy's big brother said, hey, when I was 13 a year later, I had a moped and he said, I'll pay you 20 bucks to deliver this marijuana to this house, this house and that house.
[00:41:25.159 --> 00:41:27.279]  Of course, I didn't do it.
[00:41:27.279 --> 00:41:29.440]  And he got mad at me and didn't trust me anymore.
[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:32.761]  But the point is, that's how America operates.
[00:41:33.755 --> 00:41:36.076]  That's how America operates.
[00:41:36.076 --> 00:41:38.557]  And the cops would be having D.A.R.E.
[00:41:38.557 --> 00:41:42.860]  programs and talking about drug testing at the school and drug dogs.
[00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:47.182]  And I would see cops that I knew were involved in drug dealing.
[00:41:47.182 --> 00:41:48.843]  And I would say, you're not going to search me.
[00:41:48.843 --> 00:41:50.183]  I don't use drugs like you do.
[00:41:50.183 --> 00:41:55.766]  And the cops would flip out, take me into the office, slam my head in the desk and scream at me.
[00:41:55.766 --> 00:42:02.550]  They were so mad that I wouldn't love their evil and bow down to their drug dealing anymore.
[00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:02.630]  OK?
[00:42:03.766 --> 00:42:05.507]  This is what America is.
[00:42:05.507 --> 00:42:08.268]  Rotten as Hades itself.
[00:42:08.268 --> 00:42:11.009]  And if we don't admit this, we have no future.
[00:42:11.009 --> 00:42:15.091]  It's coming to a terminal head.
[00:42:15.091 --> 00:42:19.913]  Now, you may live in a town where the cops don't deal the drugs.
[00:42:19.913 --> 00:42:23.855]  But... That's the exception.
[00:42:23.855 --> 00:42:27.357]  Not the rule.
[00:42:27.357 --> 00:42:31.039]  Alright, I'm gonna shut up and go to your calls.
[00:42:31.039 --> 00:42:31.739]  It's just that...
[00:42:33.726 --> 00:42:41.349]  In my gut, in my intellect, in my spirit, my discernment, whatever you want to call it, I am on the edge of my seat right now.
[00:42:41.349 --> 00:42:55.655]  I've told you in the last year that my spidey sense, we all have it, my sixth sense, my gut, has been absolutely on edge, like I'm at the edge of a cliff.
[00:42:55.655 --> 00:43:00.137]  And now it's intensifying, intensifying every hour.
[00:43:00.137 --> 00:43:03.258]  They are preparing some type of World War III startup
[00:43:05.049 --> 00:43:13.933]  The globalists are preparing massive terror attacks in America and Europe, and it is going to be hellish.
[00:43:13.933 --> 00:43:26.198]  It is going to be absolutely horrible, and we're going to have to watch the murderers, the social engineers who've done the attacks, grandstand as our saviors.
[00:43:26.198 --> 00:43:33.761]  And as the public gets scared during a depression and during a war, they think you're going to go along with their takeover of America.
[00:43:34.969 --> 00:43:56.977]  And it's time for every radio talk show host, every police officer, every pastor, every college professor, every school teacher, every doctor, every lawyer, every auto mechanic, every farmer, every rancher, every factory worker, every lawn person.
[00:43:56.977 --> 00:43:58.358]  I don't care what you do.
[00:43:58.358 --> 00:43:59.418]  Every retail clerk.
[00:44:01.994 --> 00:44:16.947]  To count the cost, to face history, to realize that while we've been tuned into a false reality of football and celebrity and all the rest of it that people are such experts on, that reality's been going on all around you.
[00:44:16.947 --> 00:44:25.454]  While you're busy out in the middle of a field watching a television, and you think that television's the only thing in the world, you didn't hear the wolves howling.
[00:44:26.758 --> 00:44:38.400]  Now the wolves are all around you, in the dark, and you can look out from the glow of the TV in the middle of this field we're in collectively, and see their eyes, and hear their growling.
[00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:45.622]  And the television's telling you, those are friends, lay down, show them your neck, they want to lick it.
[00:44:45.622 --> 00:44:50.923]  And the TV says, lay down, the wolves are here to help, and many Americans are going, okay, alright, here's my neck.
[00:44:53.697 --> 00:44:59.502]  And we watch as Americans are grabbed by the wolves and drug out into the night.
[00:44:59.502 --> 00:45:11.833]  Good people have to get together around a code of ethics and ideas and defend those, or civilization always falls.
[00:45:11.833 --> 00:45:15.697]  One of the globalist's biggest problems to handle is how do they
[00:45:17.418 --> 00:45:25.702]  Balance the countries they're looting and how do they keep safe havens for themselves to move to after they've totally destroyed societies.
[00:45:25.702 --> 00:45:36.227]  They want to play the military industrial complex foot soldiers, the police, the military, the private contractors, off against the American people.
[00:45:36.227 --> 00:45:41.390]  But the 30 pieces of silver you're being given to carry out the destruction of America
[00:45:45.168 --> 00:45:52.430]  The conversion of America to a third world dictatorship of the plutocrats.
[00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:56.592]  You're destroying your own nest, your own future, your children's future.
[00:45:56.592 --> 00:46:03.054]  You are selling your birthright for nothing.
[00:46:03.054 --> 00:46:06.415]  For nothing, for a pittance.
[00:46:06.415 --> 00:46:13.377]  I'm gonna go to Dana, Lennon, Carl, Sean, Sean and others.
[00:46:15.285 --> 00:46:22.213]  But I just want to impart to you the magnitude of this.
[00:46:22.213 --> 00:46:27.538]  We are entering a nightmare tyranny.
[00:46:27.538 --> 00:46:29.981]  There is no doubt.
[00:46:29.981 --> 00:46:32.984]  A nightmare.
[00:46:32.984 --> 00:46:36.128]  It could stop any time people start valuing liberty.
[00:46:37.401 --> 00:47:02.570]  But when the average man thinks that being a man is lifting weights and having big muscles and strutting around and watching football and driving a big pickup truck, and I like big pickup trucks too, I'm saying that's not, being a man doesn't mean you act like you're a man and act like you're looking for trouble with somebody that cuts in front of you at the grocery store at the liquor aisle.
[00:47:07.045 --> 00:47:09.547]  Being a man means you're informed.
[00:47:09.547 --> 00:47:11.889]  Being a man means you're involved.
[00:47:11.889 --> 00:47:21.676]  Being a man means that you see it as your absolute mission to defend our Republic.
[00:47:21.676 --> 00:47:26.199]  Whatever the cost is.
[00:47:26.199 --> 00:47:34.766]  And being a man means you have the courage to not be brainwashed and buy into the false psychological warfare paradigm that you're fed.
[00:47:37.315 --> 00:47:40.680]  Let's go to Dana in Alabama.
[00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:41.241]  You're on the air.
[00:47:41.241 --> 00:47:42.884]  Thanks for holding.
[00:47:42.884 --> 00:47:43.825]  Hey, Alex.
[00:47:43.825 --> 00:47:45.267]  It's good to talk to you again.
[00:47:45.267 --> 00:47:46.309]  Good to talk to you, sir.
[00:47:46.309 --> 00:47:46.910]  What's on your mind?
[00:47:47.887 --> 00:47:49.688]  Hey, look, I've got one question.
[00:47:49.688 --> 00:47:51.369]  I'll make it quick.
[00:47:51.369 --> 00:47:56.232]  It's kind of a crazy question, but I've seen a lot of craziness by this government.
[00:47:56.232 --> 00:48:06.558]  Look, my eyes are telling me something that my mind is telling me is impossible, but it might be my spidey sense, my spidey sense making me ask this question.
[00:48:06.558 --> 00:48:09.600]  When is somebody going to do a facial measurement?
[00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:12.483]  They do look a little bit alike.
[00:48:12.483 --> 00:48:14.045]  That is hilarious.
[00:48:14.045 --> 00:48:14.846]  Osama Obama.
[00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:43.537]  Oh, by the way, will you re-pull that Stratfor, a very respected private intelligence group based here in Austin, Texas, that even does reportage for the federal government, has come out and said that that wasn't Bin Laden, they killed at that compound, and that it's as phony as a $3 bill.
[00:48:43.537 --> 00:48:45.740]  Dana, I appreciate your call.
[00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:47.021]  That's hilarious.
[00:48:47.021 --> 00:48:48.282]  I know they've done the voice prints.
[00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:51.523]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Lennon in Oregon.
[00:48:51.523 --> 00:48:52.984]  You're on the air.
[00:48:52.984 --> 00:48:53.705]  Thanks for holding.
[00:49:07.588 --> 00:49:08.789]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:49:08.789 --> 00:49:13.553]  I'll try to be quick so I don't get too much cancer for myself.
[00:49:13.553 --> 00:49:16.475]  First, I want to thank you.
[00:49:16.475 --> 00:49:25.842]  I know you don't like to talk about yourself, but you woke me up during the fall of 2008, and it is you who is doing God's work.
[00:49:25.842 --> 00:49:30.726]  I know we're going to win this because of your listeners.
[00:49:30.726 --> 00:49:32.407]  We're much stronger than the other side.
[00:49:32.407 --> 00:49:33.187]  The other side is weak.
[00:49:34.423 --> 00:49:37.086]  Look, the Rothschilds are a bunch of inbreds.
[00:49:37.086 --> 00:49:43.773]  Anyway, there's only, what, 6,000 superfamilies or whatever?
[00:49:43.773 --> 00:49:48.779]  There's less than 20 superfamilies, so only a few thousand of those.
[00:49:48.779 --> 00:49:53.164]  But Rothkopf, the head of the Kissinger Group, wrote in his book three years ago,
[00:49:53.624 --> 00:49:54.946]  Right, and they really believe that too.
[00:50:10.475 --> 00:50:25.602]  You're on a roll today, and I was taking a lot of notes, but there's one thing that I really want to focus on, and this is basically for Steve Mustaine, anybody that does not understand what gold is, gold is money, by definition, by the definition of money.
[00:50:25.602 --> 00:50:27.042]  I'm just going to roll through this really quickly.
[00:50:27.042 --> 00:50:28.403]  You said that information's for who?
[00:50:30.196 --> 00:50:37.805]  Steve Mustaine because you know some people don't understand that when there is a collapse we're going to use gold and silver as money.
[00:50:37.805 --> 00:50:40.529]  You mean Dave Mustaine?
[00:50:40.529 --> 00:50:41.770]  I'm sorry Dave.
[00:50:41.770 --> 00:50:47.577]  Yeah but the guy that was criticizing gold was the front man for ministry.
[00:50:50.167 --> 00:50:52.571]  Not Dave Mustaine.
[00:50:52.571 --> 00:50:55.535]  But listen, I'll have you finish up your point on gold when we come back.
[00:50:55.535 --> 00:50:59.441]  By the way, Dave Mustaine's a listener, so... We'll be right back.
[00:50:59.441 --> 00:50:59.822]  Stay with us.
[00:51:00.819 --> 00:51:06.043]  We all know that Berkey Water Purification Systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:52:00.513 --> 00:52:06.097]  Infowars.com for 16 years has led the charge against the technocrats.
[00:52:06.097 --> 00:52:14.362]  We have had unrivaled success in unlocking mines, expanding paradigms, and rallying the people to face the new world order.
[00:52:14.362 --> 00:52:15.403]  No one can deny.
[00:52:15.603 --> 00:52:26.348]  That our media operation is the tip of the spear, and it's because of our success that we have a responsibility to intensify our operations against the globalists 110%.
[00:52:26.348 --> 00:52:31.350]  We're only a month away from launching a weeknight news broadcast.
[00:52:31.350 --> 00:52:33.811]  The social network is nearing completion as well.
[00:52:33.811 --> 00:52:36.732]  The free newsletter is reaching hundreds of thousands.
[00:52:36.732 --> 00:52:40.694]  Please spread the word about InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:52:40.974 --> 00:52:50.437]  Sign up at the top of InfoWars.com for the free InfoWars Insider email with exclusive video and text reports as well as breaking news.
[00:52:50.437 --> 00:52:52.078]  Look in the mirror.
[00:52:52.078 --> 00:52:54.158]  You are the resistance.
[00:52:54.158 --> 00:52:59.740]  It is up to us, the InfoWarriors, to take the initiative and to defeat the globalists.
[00:53:01.607 --> 00:53:06.311]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[00:53:06.311 --> 00:53:12.738]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[00:53:12.738 --> 00:53:15.000]  Number one, study the past.
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.402]  History really does repeat itself.
[00:53:17.402 --> 00:53:21.125]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[00:53:22.256 --> 00:53:25.339]  Number three, take decisive action.
[00:53:25.339 --> 00:53:29.202]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[00:53:29.202 --> 00:53:34.226]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[00:53:34.226 --> 00:53:38.249]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[00:53:38.249 --> 00:53:41.652]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[00:53:41.652 --> 00:53:45.294]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:53:46.135 --> 00:53:51.057]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[00:53:51.057 --> 00:53:55.679]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:53:55.679 --> 00:53:58.380]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:54:06.115 --> 00:54:08.317]  I was a highway man.
[00:54:08.317 --> 00:54:10.739]  Along the coach roads I did ride.
[00:54:10.739 --> 00:54:16.124]  We're only nine days away from the launch of InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:54:16.124 --> 00:54:17.705]  Every evening, 7 p.m.
[00:54:17.705 --> 00:54:18.646]  Central, 8 p.m.
[00:54:18.646 --> 00:54:19.667]  Eastern.
[00:54:19.667 --> 00:54:21.989]  That's six mountain.
[00:54:23.547 --> 00:54:32.053]  Five Pacific, we will have a 30-minute focus, condensed, power-packed, information-packed, 30-minute transmission.
[00:54:32.053 --> 00:54:38.016]  Many Nights will then continue live with an extended interview or an extended special report.
[00:54:38.016 --> 00:54:50.925]  We'll be premiering a lot of special reports as well that we have produced at the end of the nightly news, Many Nights, and we're developing it for PrisonPlanet.tv members, and we have
[00:54:52.426 --> 00:54:57.268]  A lot of cable networks and systems that are interested in picking it up.
[00:54:57.268 --> 00:55:02.630]  I've had people offer me, you know, hey, produce a TV show and we'll put it on our cable system.
[00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:04.291]  Or we'll put it on the satellite system.
[00:55:04.291 --> 00:55:13.675]  But I've had people come to us years ago and again this year, even last month, and say, add it together every day, the highlights of your three-hour radio show.
[00:55:13.675 --> 00:55:16.437]  It's also streamed out as TV at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:55:16.437 --> 00:55:18.257]  You know, the production's pretty good.
[00:55:18.257 --> 00:55:19.078]  We'd like to put it on.
[00:55:20.106 --> 00:55:44.012]  This guy television feed or we'd like to put it on this German feed or this Japanese feed or this feed that's you know channel thousand something in the US and I just haven't had the time the energy to get that done but now that's what the news show is going to be about and so now is a better time than ever to become a member at PrisonPlanet.tv and one of my great IT peoples.
[00:55:45.123 --> 00:55:47.484]  Father died of a heart attack last week.
[00:55:47.484 --> 00:55:58.010]  We would have already launched some new features for PrisonPlanet.TV, but his dad died last Monday, and so he isn't coming back until Wednesday.
[00:55:58.010 --> 00:56:08.435]  We could have already launched it, too, but we need him here to make sure when we launch these new features at PrisonPlanet.TV, so our prayers go out to that particular individual here in the office.
[00:56:08.435 --> 00:56:09.475]  Okay, Lennon.
[00:56:09.475 --> 00:56:10.376]  Yeah, to be clear,
[00:56:10.996 --> 00:56:18.359]  We had the frontman Al Jorgensen of Ministry on saying everything's going to collapse so bad you won't even want gold.
[00:56:18.359 --> 00:56:23.281]  So it wasn't Dave Mustaine that you heard criticizing gold.
[00:56:23.281 --> 00:56:24.421]  Right.
[00:56:24.421 --> 00:56:30.724]  And so, you know, he could be right in effect that this economy
[00:56:31.443 --> 00:56:32.844]  Looks like it's going to collapse.
[00:56:32.844 --> 00:56:35.667]  The world economy looks like it's going to collapse.
[00:56:35.667 --> 00:56:50.198]  It was done by design, by Ivy League economists like Paul Krugman, who in his Nobel laureate speech said there's going to be a rise of firms, and we're setting this corporatocracy up, this fascist economy up.
[00:56:50.198 --> 00:56:51.499]  Well, it doesn't look like it.
[00:56:51.499 --> 00:56:56.443]  I mean, we've got the IMF World Bank documents, and that's how we predicted all this with total precision.
[00:56:56.443 --> 00:56:56.944]  This is 100% scripted.
[00:56:59.082 --> 00:57:00.623]  Right, exactly.
[00:57:00.623 --> 00:57:07.949]  But when it does collapse, you see, there's still going to need to be a store of wealth and a means of exchange.
[00:57:07.949 --> 00:57:12.173]  And by definition, gold is money.
[00:57:12.173 --> 00:57:19.438]  And let me just run through this for... Listen, listen, Lennon, if people don't understand this, they're never going to understand it.
[00:57:19.438 --> 00:57:24.102]  If they don't understand that the dollar's been devalued, so gold's almost $1,900 and silver was $5 and it's $43 today,
[00:57:28.305 --> 00:57:39.654]  It's an industrial metal, it's always been money since civilization existed, and it's a hedge against inflation, and it's something you can barter with, and it's easily transportable store of wealth.
[00:57:39.654 --> 00:57:53.185]  If people don't understand that, that in Africa 5,000 years ago it was money, in China 5,000 years ago it was money, that it was money with the Aztecs 2,000 years ago, you're not going to be able to explain it to them.
[00:57:53.185 --> 00:57:54.046]  I appreciate your call.
[00:57:54.957 --> 00:57:56.418]  You're not going to be able to explain it.
[00:57:56.418 --> 00:58:09.724]  Listen, Mike Adams wrote a really nice article about me, because he's had a chance to come in our office and see that we're here working hard, and the headline is, Alex Jones for real.
[00:58:09.724 --> 00:58:15.047]  And Aaron asked me if I wanted to post this yesterday, and I said, I don't know.
[00:58:15.047 --> 00:58:17.989]  But I made the decision today to post it, because it...
[00:58:19.318 --> 00:58:20.038]  It's pointless.
[00:58:20.038 --> 00:58:21.099]  I mean, he's nice to write it.
[00:58:21.099 --> 00:58:22.479]  It's a nice article.
[00:58:22.479 --> 00:58:27.841]  But who cares if people have debates about whether I'm real or not?
[00:58:27.841 --> 00:58:32.102]  If people don't know I'm real, then it's kind of like an IQ test.
[00:58:32.102 --> 00:58:37.164]  They can go put, you know, the helmet on and go live in a rubber room.
[00:58:37.164 --> 00:58:38.124]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[00:58:38.124 --> 00:58:44.546]  Stay with us.
[00:58:44.546 --> 00:58:48.287]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:50.607 --> 00:58:51.788]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:58:51.788 --> 00:58:58.713]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:58:58.713 --> 00:59:01.275]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:59:01.275 --> 00:59:06.639]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:59:06.639 --> 00:59:09.701]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:59:09.701 --> 00:59:12.003]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:59:12.003 --> 00:59:17.887]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:59:18.067 --> 00:59:18.247]  Yes.
[00:59:18.247 --> 00:59:21.630]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:59:21.630 --> 00:59:27.414]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:59:27.414 --> 00:59:29.055]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:59:29.055 --> 00:59:30.356]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:59:30.356 --> 00:59:33.018]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:59:33.018 --> 00:59:37.241]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:59:37.241 --> 00:59:39.923]  You can find the video at www.barronjones.com.
[00:59:40.043 --> 00:59:41.845]  End of America 3.com.
[00:59:41.845 --> 00:59:44.447]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[00:59:44.447 --> 00:59:48.311]  Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[00:59:48.311 --> 00:59:53.617]  That's endofamerica3.com.
[00:59:53.617 --> 00:59:56.019]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.019 --> 00:59:58.802]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.322 --> 01:00:10.145]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.145 --> 01:00:11.746]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.746 --> 01:00:13.287]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.287 --> 01:00:17.469]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.469 --> 01:00:21.531]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:26.674 --> 01:00:28.395]  All right, we're into our number two.
[01:00:28.395 --> 01:00:36.179]  We got Gerald Cilente coming up, Paul Joseph Watson, both by video Skype for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[01:00:36.179 --> 01:00:38.720]  That's an interesting footnote.
[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:45.123]  And we also have Webster Tarpley, who was in Libya just a month ago, to report on the big developments there.
[01:00:45.123 --> 01:00:48.705]  And I'll cover more of that ahead of Tarpley joining us.
[01:00:49.870 --> 01:00:52.611]  I have another important report here.
[01:00:52.611 --> 01:01:03.894]  Obama hits struggling Americans with energy rate hikes, a direct tax to General Electric and others who are exempt from these new restrictions.
[01:01:03.894 --> 01:01:14.377]  Just absolute discrimination of the highest order against everyone that's not an insider, but people think discrimination is only about race or skin color or religion.
[01:01:14.377 --> 01:01:17.538]  Another way they've psychologically handicapped people.
[01:01:17.538 --> 01:01:18.238]  Let's go to
[01:01:19.932 --> 01:01:24.313]  Carl in California, then Sean, Sean, Teresa, Johnny, and others.
[01:01:24.313 --> 01:01:32.056]  Go ahead, you're on the air, Carl.
[01:01:32.056 --> 01:01:33.756]  Okay, we gotta move on.
[01:01:33.756 --> 01:01:38.518]  Let's go ahead and talk to Sean in Canada.
[01:01:38.518 --> 01:01:38.858]  Go ahead.
[01:01:40.046 --> 01:01:42.447]  Hey Alex, thanks for having me on, man.
[01:01:42.447 --> 01:01:43.428]  Thanks for calling.
[01:01:43.428 --> 01:01:52.013]  Listen, listen, these arrogant talk show hosts make you grovel to them because you have to fight to get through the arrogant screener and get on air, and I appreciate you saying thanks for having me on.
[01:01:52.013 --> 01:01:55.015]  Thanks for calling, but you don't have to thank me for the work I do.
[01:01:55.015 --> 01:01:57.096]  You don't have to thank me for having you on.
[01:01:57.096 --> 01:02:00.658]  I appreciate you, and I want to hear what you have to say, so go ahead.
[01:02:00.658 --> 01:02:05.781]  Okay, real quick, I came across an article
[01:02:06.688 --> 01:02:08.070]  We're good to go.
[01:02:21.404 --> 01:02:28.511]  Uh, basically what she was doing was having yard sales, uh, trying to raise money to, uh, you know, basically pay for her treatments and everything.
[01:02:28.511 --> 01:02:38.220]  Yeah, you know, I meant to cover that, and I didn't, and I went to tell the producers to get her on, and so they came and fined her, didn't they, for having a garage sale?
[01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:38.880]  Yep, yep.
[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:40.001]  Unbelievable, man.
[01:02:40.001 --> 01:02:40.942]  Unbelievable.
[01:02:40.942 --> 01:02:42.604]  A woman sitting here fighting for her life.
[01:02:43.374 --> 01:02:49.838]  And the government's coming in here and fining her for selling her own property on her, you know, her own personal possessions on her own property.
[01:02:49.838 --> 01:02:51.719]  See, that's what I was saying earlier.
[01:02:51.719 --> 01:02:55.041]  They're arresting people to eliminate Stan's children.
[01:02:55.041 --> 01:02:57.923]  They're threatening to arrest Girl Scouts with cookies.
[01:02:57.923 --> 01:03:02.125]  Government wants all commerce totally under their control.
[01:03:02.125 --> 01:03:05.847]  Even though, you know, they're paying taxes on everything they're buying.
[01:03:05.847 --> 01:03:08.429]  They're paying taxes on the cookies they're selling.
[01:03:08.429 --> 01:03:09.710]  They're going after the Amish.
[01:03:10.865 --> 01:03:13.566]  There's the headline at Infowars.com.
[01:03:13.566 --> 01:03:17.307]  Arrested for selling 10-cent lemonade at the Washington Capitol.
[01:03:17.307 --> 01:03:21.007]  So the big bankers can steal tens of trillions.
[01:03:21.007 --> 01:03:24.508]  But, you know, I saw that article a week ago and that fell through the cracks.
[01:03:24.508 --> 01:03:25.449]  What's her name again?
[01:03:25.449 --> 01:03:26.649]  What was the headline?
[01:03:26.649 --> 01:03:30.830]  And we will at least air the local newscast because I saw the newscast.
[01:03:30.830 --> 01:03:32.390]  Where did that happen again?
[01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:34.271]  It was in Salem.
[01:03:34.271 --> 01:03:35.431]  Her name is Jan Klein.
[01:03:36.725 --> 01:03:41.552]  Um, the title of it was Bone Cancer Patient Shards Show Shut Down by Salem Government.
[01:03:41.552 --> 01:03:45.618]  Yeah, bone, yeah, bone cancer.
[01:03:45.618 --> 01:03:46.399]  Say it again slowly.
[01:03:47.296 --> 01:03:52.238]  Uh, bone cancer patients, yard sale, shut down by Salem government.
[01:03:52.238 --> 01:03:54.759]  And it was, uh, the date on it's August 21st.
[01:03:54.759 --> 01:03:58.941]  Now I know we posted it, uh, at InfoWars.com.
[01:03:58.941 --> 01:04:03.543]  Um, it didn't have that headline, but we'll, we'll pull that up right now.
[01:04:03.543 --> 01:04:06.604]  Because I may even get to the lemonade stuff when we come back from break.
[01:04:06.604 --> 01:04:14.487]  Uh, just to illustrate all of this, and attacking the Amish, people selling eggs, or squash, or peaches, or strawberries on the side of the road.
[01:04:14.487 --> 01:04:16.288]  I'm seeing these articles every day.
[01:04:17.228 --> 01:04:21.851]  And there's the headline, bone cancer patient yard sale shut down by Salem government.
[01:04:21.851 --> 01:04:27.596]  And absolutely, she's selling her belongings to try to get cancer treatment and they're saying no.
[01:04:27.596 --> 01:04:36.582]  But then the illegal aliens can run around, that's one of the biggest groups doing it, stealing the metal off of things en masse and nothing's done to them.
[01:04:36.582 --> 01:04:41.285]  Because that's a protected special group to help drive the wages down and further bankrupt America.
[01:04:41.285 --> 01:04:44.688]  I have nothing against the illegal aliens, the point is, they shouldn't be above the law.
[01:04:45.836 --> 01:04:48.297]  Anything else there, Sean?
[01:04:48.297 --> 01:04:48.757]  Um, no.
[01:04:48.757 --> 01:04:54.799]  Just tell everybody to make sure you register to vote Ron Paul in the primaries.
[01:04:54.799 --> 01:04:55.300]  Absolutely.
[01:04:55.300 --> 01:04:56.260]  We gotta get her on.
[01:04:56.260 --> 01:04:57.580]  I want her on ASAP.
[01:04:57.580 --> 01:04:58.701]  We'll be right back with more of your calls.
[01:05:01.983 --> 01:05:06.689]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[01:05:06.689 --> 01:05:13.116]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[01:05:13.116 --> 01:05:15.399]  Number one, study the past.
[01:05:15.399 --> 01:05:17.802]  History really does repeat itself.
[01:05:17.802 --> 01:05:21.526]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[01:05:22.631 --> 01:05:25.734]  Number three, take decisive action.
[01:05:25.734 --> 01:05:29.577]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[01:05:29.577 --> 01:05:34.621]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[01:05:34.621 --> 01:05:38.044]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[01:05:38.604 --> 01:05:42.026]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[01:05:42.026 --> 01:05:46.528]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:05:46.528 --> 01:05:51.451]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[01:05:51.451 --> 01:05:56.073]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:05:56.073 --> 01:05:58.235]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:06:01.511 --> 01:06:05.513]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:06:05.513 --> 01:06:08.775]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:06:08.775 --> 01:06:13.577]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:06:13.577 --> 01:06:19.961]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:06:19.961 --> 01:06:22.182]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:06:22.702 --> 01:06:24.344]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:06:24.344 --> 01:06:25.505]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:06:25.505 --> 01:06:27.747]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:06:41.641 --> 01:06:43.762]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:06:43.762 --> 01:06:48.903]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:06:48.903 --> 01:06:58.026]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:07:01.957 --> 01:07:05.918]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:07:05.918 --> 01:07:14.779]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:07:14.779 --> 01:07:19.400]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:30.222]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:07:30.862 --> 01:07:40.365]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:07:40.365 --> 01:07:45.807]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:07:45.807 --> 01:07:53.290]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:07:53.290 --> 01:07:56.051]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:08:00.876 --> 01:08:06.142]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:06.142 --> 01:08:08.445]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:22.383 --> 01:08:28.804]  It was a listener that brought up the fact that I haven't covered this properly, and he's absolutely right.
[01:08:28.804 --> 01:08:37.707]  Because there's so many of these cases now, but out of Salem, Oregon, the city shuts down cancer victims' yard sale.
[01:08:37.707 --> 01:08:41.148]  She doesn't have a job, she doesn't have insurance, she can't get insurance.
[01:08:42.108 --> 01:08:53.455]  So she's trying to sell her belongings and they have now said that they're going to fine her and arrest her if she tries to sell anybody anything.
[01:08:53.455 --> 01:08:56.437]  Slaves aren't allowed to sell and barter.
[01:08:56.437 --> 01:08:58.438]  Everything's got to go through a big bank.
[01:08:58.438 --> 01:08:59.478]  Everything's got to be tracked.
[01:08:59.478 --> 01:09:01.479]  Everything's got to be bought at a Walmart.
[01:09:01.479 --> 01:09:03.761]  You're not going to sell eggs on the side of the road or peaches.
[01:09:03.761 --> 01:09:05.062]  You're going to be arrested.
[01:09:05.062 --> 01:09:06.162]  You're not going to sell lemonade.
[01:09:06.162 --> 01:09:06.983]  You're going to be arrested.
[01:09:07.975 --> 01:09:15.563]  And in D.C., they've been arresting children and others that try to sell lemonade or anything else.
[01:09:15.563 --> 01:09:24.572]  And so that's why a group of activists went out and the videos on Infowars.com arrested for selling 10-cent lemonade at the Washington Capitol.
[01:09:26.115 --> 01:09:28.537]  And they're just out in the middle of the park.
[01:09:28.537 --> 01:09:30.439]  They're selling lemonade.
[01:09:30.439 --> 01:09:34.922]  And you see SWAT teams with their binoculars acting like Osama Bin Laden has been found.
[01:09:34.922 --> 01:09:39.806]  You're going to find him over at the Pentagon, boys, along with Ammar al-Awlaki.
[01:09:39.806 --> 01:09:42.669]  And they come over with police, freak out, and arrest them.
[01:09:44.250 --> 01:09:46.252]  And the police are freaking out.
[01:09:46.252 --> 01:09:50.957]  They are so upset that the slaves are doing this.
[01:09:50.957 --> 01:09:57.284]  Now, the cops love their pensions that are going to be taken and devalued by hyperinflation down to nothing.
[01:09:57.284 --> 01:09:59.967]  They love the cancer viruses and the vaccines.
[01:09:59.967 --> 01:10:02.469]  They love the fluoride they drink in their water.
[01:10:02.469 --> 01:10:02.950]  They love it.
[01:10:02.950 --> 01:10:04.151]  They love the authority.
[01:10:04.151 --> 01:10:05.412]  And so they're going to get it.
[01:10:06.138 --> 01:10:09.841]  You're going to get everything you ever wanted.
[01:10:09.841 --> 01:10:10.521]  Okay?
[01:10:10.521 --> 01:10:12.262]  Total collapse, total depression.
[01:10:12.262 --> 01:10:18.086]  But you'll still get to act tough and waddle around and deal narcotics to people.
[01:10:18.086 --> 01:10:23.150]  So, both of those videos are up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:10:23.150 --> 01:10:26.312]  City shuts down cancer victims yard sale.
[01:10:26.312 --> 01:10:33.037]  And they're telling the police, don't really respond to major crimes in many cities, like Oakland.
[01:10:34.036 --> 01:10:36.217]  Where they don't respond to 35 major crimes.
[01:10:36.217 --> 01:10:38.959]  Go out and revenue generate.
[01:10:38.959 --> 01:10:42.061]  And if a cop complains, you're fired!
[01:10:42.061 --> 01:10:42.661]  Okay?
[01:10:42.661 --> 01:10:43.962]  We're here to raise money.
[01:10:43.962 --> 01:10:45.083]  That's it.
[01:10:45.083 --> 01:10:49.166]  And they tell the cops, keep raising money, you won't lose your job, or you won't get your pay cut.
[01:10:49.166 --> 01:10:51.347]  But in the end, you're going to lose everything.
[01:10:51.347 --> 01:10:51.687]  You see?
[01:10:51.687 --> 01:11:00.633]  Because you made a deal with the devil, and you went along with it, and the same thing for the bureaucrats and the defense contractors, and all of you, who let us get to this point.
[01:11:02.316 --> 01:11:06.339]  All of you who sold out and decided corruption was okay.
[01:11:06.339 --> 01:11:08.501]  Well, now we have sown the wind.
[01:11:08.501 --> 01:11:11.283]  We're going to reap the whirlwind.
[01:11:11.283 --> 01:11:16.907]  Jan Klein was holding yard sales each weekend in her backyard to raise money to pay her medical bills.
[01:11:16.907 --> 01:11:19.989]  But the city of Salem shut her down after a neighbor complained.
[01:11:19.989 --> 01:11:23.832]  Ah, good, good Stasi.
[01:11:23.832 --> 01:11:27.095]  A city ordinance prohibits people from holding more than three yard sales a year.
[01:11:27.938 --> 01:11:34.363]  The city has the ordinance because it says in the past people had set up flea market style sales on their property.
[01:11:34.363 --> 01:11:38.266]  The story galvanized people who were outraged that the city wouldn't make an exception.
[01:11:38.266 --> 01:11:39.607]  How about freedom?
[01:11:39.607 --> 01:11:48.434]  How about if you want to go somewhere where you're not allowed to have yard sales, you go and move into one of these little Nazi homeowners associations?
[01:11:50.506 --> 01:11:53.849]  Which almost always have corruption and money stealing going on in them.
[01:11:53.849 --> 01:11:55.351]  Go, go do that!
[01:11:55.351 --> 01:11:58.334]  But people live in regular houses.
[01:11:58.334 --> 01:11:59.515]  They should have their own rights.
[01:11:59.515 --> 01:12:03.719]  These city ordinances where you can't have gardens or you can't have garage sales, baloney.
[01:12:03.719 --> 01:12:11.047]  And now they're annexing rural areas and pulling up in front of old farmers' houses saying, get rid of those old tractors and those old junk cars.
[01:12:11.047 --> 01:12:13.590]  And the old 80-year-old man looks at them and says, Sonny, get out of here.
[01:12:14.150 --> 01:12:17.572]  Then the old man, you've seen the cases, doesn't pay the fines.
[01:12:17.572 --> 01:12:18.872]  He holds himself up in the house.
[01:12:18.872 --> 01:12:20.933]  The SWAT team comes and shoots him.
[01:12:20.933 --> 01:12:22.794]  And then goes out and has beers afterwards.
[01:12:22.794 --> 01:12:23.855]  That's what men do.
[01:12:23.855 --> 01:12:26.296]  They kill old veterans.
[01:12:26.296 --> 01:12:27.676]  That's how things operate here.
[01:12:27.676 --> 01:12:30.498]  These are real tough guys here.
[01:12:30.498 --> 01:12:31.798]  You know, they like to kill Americans.
[01:12:31.798 --> 01:12:32.699]  And they do.
[01:12:32.699 --> 01:12:33.479]  And they will kill more.
[01:12:33.479 --> 01:12:35.020]  Don't worry.
[01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:39.282]  Meanwhile, the big mega banks can steal tens of trillions of dollars and get in zero trouble.
[01:12:40.481 --> 01:12:43.983]  Major mega banks can launder hundreds of billions of dollars a year publicly.
[01:12:43.983 --> 01:12:45.084]  No one gets in trouble.
[01:12:45.084 --> 01:12:47.266]  Came out last week what we already knew.
[01:12:47.266 --> 01:12:48.827]  You know, the Bernie Madoff situation.
[01:12:48.827 --> 01:12:56.612]  Insiders for 11 years gave the SEC, the Securities and Exchange Commission, total dossiers on what Madoff was doing.
[01:12:58.943 --> 01:13:03.245]  And nothing was done except for having the dossiers destroyed.
[01:13:03.245 --> 01:13:08.947]  Now it turns out in thousands of insider reports of corruptions... Oh yeah, back it up!
[01:13:08.947 --> 01:13:13.749]  The evil lemonade salespeople are trying to get... Oh, the officer got him!
[01:13:13.749 --> 01:13:15.310]  Good!
[01:13:15.310 --> 01:13:16.290]  Good, good, good!
[01:13:16.290 --> 01:13:18.391]  And if you try to have a yard sale, he's gonna get you.
[01:13:18.391 --> 01:13:20.692]  Try to sell tomatoes, he's gonna get you.
[01:13:22.358 --> 01:13:23.098]  All over the country.
[01:13:23.098 --> 01:13:32.121]  It's not just at a park, you know, 400 yards away from the Supreme Rulers, you know, the People's Park.
[01:13:32.121 --> 01:13:33.561]  Oh, look at him patting her down.
[01:13:33.561 --> 01:13:36.042]  Yes, patting the terrorist down.
[01:13:36.042 --> 01:13:38.263]  They'll show you.
[01:13:38.263 --> 01:13:43.904]  Meanwhile, Obama just violated federal law and legalized 300,000 illegals who are being held for deportation.
[01:13:43.904 --> 01:13:45.785]  Deportation is over!
[01:13:45.785 --> 01:13:48.406]  La Migra no longer exists!
[01:13:48.406 --> 01:13:49.286]  Ha ha!
[01:13:50.427 --> 01:13:52.329]  And the law no longer exists.
[01:13:52.329 --> 01:13:56.813]  Only General Electric and two other companies are exempt to keep their power plants open.
[01:13:56.813 --> 01:13:58.694]  All others are to be shut down.
[01:13:58.694 --> 01:14:02.157]  You'll now have rolling blackouts and massive power increase prices.
[01:14:02.157 --> 01:14:02.878]  But so what?
[01:14:02.878 --> 01:14:04.459]  It's all part of the fun.
[01:14:04.459 --> 01:14:06.441]  Wars without congressional approval.
[01:14:06.441 --> 01:14:09.223]  Gun control without laws.
[01:14:09.223 --> 01:14:10.965]  The great time of evil is here.
[01:14:10.965 --> 01:14:14.748]  Oh, and don't think you're going to vote out Obama and the next puppet's going to save you.
[01:14:14.748 --> 01:14:17.490]  Oh no, I'm afraid it's going to only get worse.
[01:14:18.413 --> 01:14:24.478]  Unless you elect a Ron Paul who's never compromised and who has identified the exact problem and been proven right.
[01:14:24.478 --> 01:14:26.319]  That's why the whole system is against him.
[01:14:26.319 --> 01:14:29.462]  Republican, Democrat, pundits across the board.
[01:14:29.462 --> 01:14:36.167]  Pew Research shows less media coverage than any other candidate because they're scared.
[01:14:36.167 --> 01:14:39.910]  But they're not going to really criticize, except for the White House to do it, to elevate him.
[01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:42.953]  Rick Perry saying that the Fed is almost treasonous.
[01:14:44.403 --> 01:14:47.405]  No, those that go along with it are the ones that are treasonous.
[01:14:47.405 --> 01:14:49.027]  It's a foreign entity.
[01:14:49.027 --> 01:14:50.948]  It's doing what foreign corporate entities do.
[01:14:50.948 --> 01:14:52.489]  It's taking over!
[01:14:52.489 --> 01:14:56.412]  It's had a corporate takeover of America!
[01:14:56.412 --> 01:15:02.997]  And the cops know about football scores, and how to act tough, and how to get a handout on the side when they turn their blind eye.
[01:15:06.288 --> 01:15:18.617]  It's gotta feel good to be these cops in these corrupt cities where they literally got their bellies hanging out, the hats are on the back of their heads, they'll smoke cigarettes or cigars right in front of you, and you walk up with your family in New York and say, officer, do you know where this is?
[01:15:18.617 --> 01:15:22.921]  They will, to families, just say, do I look like a phone book to you?
[01:15:22.921 --> 01:15:25.583]  I mean, even a gangbanger would tell you where something was.
[01:15:25.583 --> 01:15:34.930]  But they're so hard and so gangster and so Roland that they want you to know you're scum, dirt, slime, filth, trash.
[01:15:36.522 --> 01:15:46.071]  In New York, the police, the model of America, are so corrupt that if you're protesting, they'll walk up on camera and say, I'm gonna say your camera's a gun and your bag's a bomb.
[01:15:46.071 --> 01:15:47.432]  But officer, you know it's not.
[01:15:47.432 --> 01:15:50.195]  Yeah, I know it's not, but you're gonna go to jail for that.
[01:15:52.438 --> 01:15:59.383]  I'm going to charge you with terror, hardcore felony, calling in a fake bomb threat on video.
[01:15:59.383 --> 01:16:02.225]  They even hand you the camera because they are invincible.
[01:16:02.225 --> 01:16:07.009]  The heroin, the cocaine, now they're into kidnapping little kids and selling them overseas.
[01:16:07.009 --> 01:16:13.814]  The pure evil of hell has been released, just like in Soviet Russia, just like in Nazi Germany.
[01:16:13.814 --> 01:16:19.398]  Now, good people could still wake up and turn this around, but you're going to have to face the facts and get upset.
[01:16:19.398 --> 01:16:20.159]  We're going to go to
[01:16:21.542 --> 01:16:31.463]  Sean next and others, but first I wanted to just briefly for three minutes bring Ted Anderson up with today's Midas Gold update of where silver and gold is and what's happening in the markets.
[01:16:31.463 --> 01:16:32.866]  Ted Anderson, tell us what's going on.
[01:16:33.243 --> 01:16:37.667]  Well, we've seen a high of $18.9510 on gold, $44 silver.
[01:16:37.667 --> 01:16:40.509]  My God, it's just running up.
[01:16:40.509 --> 01:16:44.272]  $18.8840 current on gold, $43.37 silver.
[01:16:44.272 --> 01:16:48.635]  I mean, Alex, I'm just reading all the articles that I have from Bloomberg and Reuters.
[01:16:48.635 --> 01:16:54.560]  I mean, they're all talking about the economy turning down worldwide, and gold is just climbing.
[01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:55.621]  I mean, almost $1,900 an ounce today.
[01:16:55.621 --> 01:16:56.802]  That $2,000 is so short, and around the corner,
[01:17:00.825 --> 01:17:06.447]  I wouldn't doubt it a bit that if we see it within two months, there's no question about it, people should get moving.
[01:17:06.447 --> 01:17:15.070]  In addition to this, I've held down prices on Franks and British Sovereigns, Walking Liberty halves, $20 gold pieces, tens.
[01:17:15.070 --> 01:17:19.331]  I've got a whole plethora of different items that you can be picking up.
[01:17:19.331 --> 01:17:27.133]  I even kept, even though silver's at $44 an ounce now, your special for the book and the DVD, The American Dream, at $83.
[01:17:29.334 --> 01:17:33.998]  Alex, that's below the cost on the silver dollars themselves.
[01:17:33.998 --> 01:17:37.020]  Add the videos and the postage and everything else in there.
[01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:43.866]  Take advantage of it now, because I can't keep doing it because of the fact that the prices have just shot up like a rocket.
[01:17:43.866 --> 01:17:46.568]  I mean, right now I've got Franks at $4.06.
[01:17:46.568 --> 01:17:52.732]  Currently, Franks right now, even on my internet prices, which are incredibly competitive, Franks right now are at $4.1079.
[01:17:52.732 --> 01:17:53.813]  British Sovereign's at $5.15.
[01:17:56.175 --> 01:17:59.017]  Presently, right now, if you call my brokers, you can pick them up at $5.09.
[01:17:59.017 --> 01:18:03.101]  You know, it's just there's a lot of different things that are going on in the market right now.
[01:18:03.101 --> 01:18:04.402]  Well, Chad, I want to be clear.
[01:18:04.402 --> 01:18:18.212]  It's $88 to get the free book, a big, thick, powerful book on the Big Brother Takeover, the American Dream animated DVD film special exposing the banksters in a very entertaining way, great to wake up newbies who aren't aware.
[01:18:19.033 --> 01:18:25.114]  And who won't watch political stuff, it's kind of done in a South Park style, very entertaining.
[01:18:25.114 --> 01:18:28.775]  Free film, free book, free shipping for $88, correct?
[01:18:28.775 --> 01:18:29.915]  Yeah, that's exactly right.
[01:18:29.915 --> 01:18:36.056]  That's two silver dollars, the book and the video and the free shipping.
[01:18:36.056 --> 01:18:37.456]  Again, folks, 800-686-2237.
[01:18:37.456 --> 01:18:45.478]  Now, I talked to you this morning and you explained to me, this is gold you bought at around the $810 level.
[01:18:46.858 --> 01:18:49.980]  And silver you bought at around the $39 level.
[01:18:49.980 --> 01:18:59.966]  The only reason you can pass on these huge specials right now is because you keep buying as it goes up and then are able to offer specials as you sell out of your inventory.
[01:18:59.966 --> 01:19:04.768]  Now you're buying gold in the market at $18.80, $18.90.
[01:19:04.768 --> 01:19:11.312]  So soon, in the next few days, if it's above $2,000, we'll be saying, this is stuff at the $19.50 level.
[01:19:11.312 --> 01:19:12.793]  Get it while you can.
[01:19:12.793 --> 01:19:14.154]  So it's very, very simple.
[01:19:14.154 --> 01:19:15.114]  Get in the time machine.
[01:19:15.114 --> 01:19:15.515]  Go back.
[01:19:16.215 --> 01:19:17.998]  Ask for the radio specials when you call.
[01:19:17.998 --> 01:19:22.303]  They've got a whole plethora, cornucopia list there.
[01:19:22.303 --> 01:19:24.386]  800-686-2237.
[01:19:24.386 --> 01:19:28.331]  They also have three silver dollars and three of my films.
[01:19:28.331 --> 01:19:29.513]  How much is that special, Ted?
[01:19:29.915 --> 01:19:33.638]  The three silver dollars and the three films, I'm holding that the same too.
[01:19:33.638 --> 01:19:37.220]  That's $130 for three silver dollars and three of your films delivered.
[01:19:37.220 --> 01:19:39.682]  So basically, free films, free shipping.
[01:19:39.682 --> 01:19:42.123]  800-686-2237.
[01:19:42.123 --> 01:19:51.650]  We're talking about being very close to $1,900 an ounce gold, silver well above... Where is it right now, Ted?
[01:19:51.650 --> 01:19:51.970]  $44.
[01:19:51.970 --> 01:19:52.930]  $44, so it's up even more.
[01:19:52.930 --> 01:19:54.571]  Let's take advantage of this stuff.
[01:19:54.571 --> 01:19:55.792]  Prices are going up tomorrow.
[01:19:55.792 --> 01:19:56.133]  800-686-2237.
[01:19:56.133 --> 01:19:56.573]  Thank you, Ted.

[01:23:28.962 --> 01:23:38.125]  Combine our Berkey water filters, which are powerful enough to purify treated, untreated, or even stagnant pond water with our storable foods, and you have a winning combination.
[01:23:38.125 --> 01:23:45.528]  Remember, we offer free shipping on every order over $50, and GCN listeners receive 5% off all ceramic filter systems.

[01:24:10.339 --> 01:24:19.168]  The globalists are admitting more and more of the stuff that they've been developing.
[01:24:19.168 --> 01:24:23.592]  IBM gets another $21 million to develop neural net ICs.
[01:24:23.592 --> 01:24:28.778]  IBM has received $21 million for its Synapse project to develop neural networking chips.
[01:24:30.003 --> 01:24:33.991]  It brings the total funding for the project to $41 million.
[01:24:33.991 --> 01:24:39.101]  Since 2008, IBM has made two prototype neural net ICs, each with 256 neuron nodes.
[01:24:41.980 --> 01:24:51.984]  Which in one chip connect to 262 144 synapse type memories and in the other chip connect to 65k synapses.
[01:24:51.984 --> 01:24:59.347]  They're trying to create an artificial humanoid brain and of course much of this they admit is for implantation into humans.
[01:24:59.347 --> 01:25:01.287]  They were fabricated using 45 NMSOICOM OS's.
[01:25:06.573 --> 01:25:15.159]  Synapses aims to replicate the computing power of the human brain within the size and power consumption restraints of the human brain.
[01:25:15.159 --> 01:25:23.264]  IBM calls its two prototype chips, Neurosynaptic Nodes, aimed at cognitive computing.
[01:25:23.264 --> 01:25:29.588]  See, they're not going to need humans pretty soon for their military, the globalist military.
[01:25:29.588 --> 01:25:33.991]  They're already converting everything over to drones in the air and soon on the ground.
[01:25:35.748 --> 01:25:42.413]  That's why the elites all write publications saying they don't need us anymore.
[01:25:42.413 --> 01:25:51.840]  Does the future need a bunch of arrested development TV watchers who have no idea what time it is?
[01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:54.262]  Well, I'm here to warn everybody and maybe folks want to listen.
[01:25:55.697 --> 01:26:01.141]  It's a fact that most major vaccines that are tested are filled with live cancer viruses.
[01:26:01.141 --> 01:26:03.662]  You might enjoy the fact that cancer is exploding.
[01:26:03.662 --> 01:26:04.843]  You might like being murdered.
[01:26:04.843 --> 01:26:06.064]  Think it's cute.
[01:26:06.064 --> 01:26:06.845]  I don't.
[01:26:06.845 --> 01:26:07.705]  I'm an extremist.
[01:26:07.705 --> 01:26:09.426]  I'm a weirdo.
[01:26:09.426 --> 01:26:13.569]  Let's go ahead and take a call here.
[01:26:13.569 --> 01:26:15.751]  Let's talk to Sean.
[01:26:15.751 --> 01:26:17.552]  Welcome, Sean, in North Carolina.
[01:26:17.552 --> 01:26:19.473]  Thanks for holding.
[01:26:19.473 --> 01:26:20.114]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:26:20.114 --> 01:26:21.134]  How are you doing today?
[01:26:21.134 --> 01:26:21.975]  I'm doing all right, sir.
[01:26:23.211 --> 01:26:26.033]  I have two issues for you.
[01:26:26.033 --> 01:26:33.839]  One, I keep getting on the Rush Radio show in Greensboro and Raleigh.
[01:26:33.839 --> 01:26:37.261]  I debated the talk show host there.
[01:26:37.261 --> 01:26:38.362]  I forget what her name was.
[01:26:38.362 --> 01:26:40.183]  Demetria, I believe.
[01:26:40.183 --> 01:26:48.289]  And we were discussing Palin, how she's wanting to go into the election, if she's going to do it or if not.
[01:26:48.289 --> 01:26:52.332]  And the thing about her was, she was saying that voters were stupid.
[01:26:53.241 --> 01:27:02.048]  And then she said, well, between these four candidates, Sarah Palin, Bachman, Perry, and some other one,
[01:27:02.856 --> 01:27:05.537]  She didn't even mention Ron Paul.
[01:27:05.537 --> 01:27:08.519]  Sir, sir, that's the talking point everywhere.
[01:27:08.519 --> 01:27:10.379]  They're told to do this.
[01:27:10.379 --> 01:27:15.802]  Or they're weak-minded and see the mainstream media not doing it, so they go, oh, I want to be establishment.
[01:27:15.802 --> 01:27:22.805]  They say we can't talk about him, why he's only the leader, number one, number two, or number three, any way you slice it.
[01:27:22.805 --> 01:27:26.227]  He's a key frontrunner, and he's been right about everything.
[01:27:26.227 --> 01:27:30.789]  Let's just, again, they get into the petty power trip of keeping info from people.
[01:27:31.509 --> 01:27:35.853]  They enjoy playing like they're globalist controllers.
[01:27:35.853 --> 01:27:46.541]  It was really funny, Alex, when I mentioned, well, Ron Paul is a constant guest on Alex Jones of Infowars.com, and he's always right.
[01:27:46.541 --> 01:27:47.842]  And so is Ron Paul.
[01:27:47.842 --> 01:27:52.405]  And as soon as I said your name on there, they started, oh, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:27:52.405 --> 01:27:53.626]  It was hilarious.
[01:27:53.626 --> 01:27:58.250]  But anyway, I wanted to thank you for waking me up, and thank you for what you're doing.
[01:27:58.615 --> 01:28:00.057]  Well, thank you so much, sir.
[01:28:00.057 --> 01:28:04.662]  I appreciate you calling.
[01:28:04.662 --> 01:28:06.684]  I've studied history.
[01:28:06.684 --> 01:28:15.994]  I haven't lived through Soviet occupation, or Nazi brutalization, or Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, or the hundreds of other examples, but I've studied it.
[01:28:17.546 --> 01:28:23.108]  And let me tell you, there's no doubt the globalists want to break America forever.
[01:28:23.108 --> 01:28:28.491]  They want to really bring in a hardcore tyranny, not a soft tyranny.
[01:28:28.491 --> 01:28:35.694]  And they want arrests and purges and persecutions and all the civil wars that come with that.
[01:28:35.694 --> 01:28:37.455]  Just like what they're doing in Libya.
[01:28:37.455 --> 01:28:39.235]  They want destabilization.
[01:28:39.235 --> 01:28:45.098]  They'll sit back, let us have a war with each other for years, in a deep depression.
[01:28:46.448 --> 01:28:53.170]  And out of it, they believe from their studies that they're going to have the central government come out on top.
[01:28:53.170 --> 01:28:56.231]  And a type of 21st century reconstruction.
[01:28:56.231 --> 01:29:01.313]  And out of it, a metamorphosized America.
[01:29:01.313 --> 01:29:06.795]  They cut off the food and water and electricity for long enough.
[01:29:06.795 --> 01:29:11.236]  The tyranny gets bad enough.
[01:29:16.317 --> 01:29:21.079]  They think that you're going to break.
[01:29:21.079 --> 01:29:24.681]  They think that you're going to give in to whatever they say.
[01:29:24.681 --> 01:29:33.545]  That's why they've worked so hard to eradicate any type of barter, any type of gardens, any type of lemonade stands, Girl Scouts.
[01:29:33.545 --> 01:29:38.368]  They don't want you, they want to extinguish the practice of people meeting at the town square.
[01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:42.604]  In the old days, that's what town squares where the open markets were.
[01:29:42.604 --> 01:29:47.189]  They want to make you go to the big box stores to buy the Chinese slave goods.
[01:29:47.189 --> 01:29:51.114]  Everything is about forming a monopoly.
[01:29:51.114 --> 01:29:52.515]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.515 --> 01:29:55.058]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.058 --> 01:29:57.721]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.786 --> 01:30:08.895]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:30:08.895 --> 01:30:11.458]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:30:11.458 --> 01:30:16.844]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:30:16.844 --> 01:30:19.888]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:30:19.888 --> 01:30:21.950]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:30:22.210 --> 01:30:28.458]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:30:28.458 --> 01:30:31.822]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:30:31.822 --> 01:30:37.609]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:30:37.609 --> 01:30:39.251]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:30:39.251 --> 01:30:40.372]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:30:40.532 --> 01:30:43.214]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:30:43.214 --> 01:30:47.437]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:30:47.437 --> 01:30:52.060]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[01:30:52.060 --> 01:30:54.641]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[01:32:00.379 --> 01:32:04.940]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:32:04.940 --> 01:32:05.840]  Number 1.
[01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:09.281]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:09.281 --> 01:32:10.141]  Number 2.
[01:32:10.141 --> 01:32:15.022]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:15.022 --> 01:32:15.762]  It's true.
[01:32:15.762 --> 01:32:20.643]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:20.643 --> 01:32:21.463]  Number 3.
[01:32:21.463 --> 01:32:25.044]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:25.044 --> 01:32:28.745]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:28.965 --> 01:32:29.746]  Number 4.
[01:32:29.746 --> 01:32:32.509]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:32.509 --> 01:32:36.193]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:32:36.193 --> 01:32:36.994]  Number 5.
[01:32:36.994 --> 01:32:41.139]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:32:41.139 --> 01:32:45.904]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:32:46.184 --> 01:32:50.348]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:33:52.801 --> 01:33:59.668]  He's gonna be joining us here in just one moment via video connection from New York.

[01:34:07.916 --> 01:34:11.279]  Obviously, radio listeners can hear Gerald.
[01:34:11.279 --> 01:34:14.763]  Because I get emails saying, why do you keep talking about watching you?
[01:34:14.763 --> 01:34:18.947]  I'm listening to you on the radio, on XM, or on a local AM or FM station.
[01:34:18.947 --> 01:34:20.328]  Yes, I know.
[01:34:20.328 --> 01:34:21.489]  We're also simulcast.
[01:34:22.472 --> 01:34:24.233]  at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:34:24.233 --> 01:34:36.819]  We're going to talk about the economy with Gerald, Libya, all over the country, people being arrested for lemonade stands, or being fined if you're dying of cancer, and you're trying to get treatment so you have a garage sale.
[01:34:36.819 --> 01:34:42.882]  Here come the police throwing the book via organized crime government.
[01:34:43.889 --> 01:34:46.049]  At the American people.
[01:34:46.049 --> 01:34:48.030]  So we're going to be discussing that with Gerald Cilente.
[01:34:48.030 --> 01:34:54.951]  First, I wanted to just remind listeners that in these uncertain times, you're crazy if you don't have storable food.
[01:34:54.951 --> 01:34:58.012]  And I mean a long-term storable food program.
[01:34:58.012 --> 01:35:05.553]  If all you can afford is a month or two, or when you go to the grocery store, buy a little extra and put it up, now is the time with all this uncertainty.
[01:35:05.553 --> 01:35:08.794]  And the best place to get your storable food is efoodsdirect.com.

[01:35:33.885 --> 01:35:40.852]  When they put fluoride in 71% of the nation's water supplies, they don't just put fluoride, they put hundreds of other deadly chemicals.
[01:35:40.852 --> 01:35:47.479]  And purewaterfreedom.com has the tabletop, the under the sink, the handheld units, the whole house systems, all made in America.
[01:35:47.479 --> 01:35:48.680]  That's made in the USA.

[01:37:03.371 --> 01:37:08.633]  You can barely get two silver dollars for 88 bucks, much less free shipping and two free gifts.
[01:37:08.633 --> 01:37:21.038]  And Ted has this as a lost leader, so I suggest you take advantage of it and follow that link at InfoWars.com today or call Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[01:37:21.038 --> 01:37:24.140]  Now your calls are coming up and so much has happened here.
[01:37:25.100 --> 01:37:30.986]  Biden is over in China begging them to continue to buy Treasury notes and groveling.
[01:37:30.986 --> 01:37:34.789]  This is exactly what the globalists have maneuvered us into this position.
[01:37:36.195 --> 01:37:39.959]  This is the wages of their New World Order, of their globalism.
[01:37:39.959 --> 01:37:48.908]  Obama has announced an acceleration of policies that have already caused a massive increase in power prices in the last three years.
[01:37:48.908 --> 01:37:50.489]  Rolling blackouts.
[01:37:50.489 --> 01:37:53.312]  General Electric is exempt from all the new policies.
[01:37:53.312 --> 01:37:56.716]  They were issued that waiver in February.
[01:37:58.444 --> 01:38:07.326]  So we have those reports, they're now announcing massive energy rate hikes, and that yes, you will have rolling blackouts, but after all, it's for the Earth.
[01:38:07.326 --> 01:38:13.268]  So it's all about artificial scarcity, making you pay a lot more for a lot less.
[01:38:13.268 --> 01:38:20.530]  This is what it's like to live in Venezuela, or to live in Ceausescu's Romania, or in North Korea.
[01:38:20.530 --> 01:38:22.550]  This is what it's like.
[01:38:22.550 --> 01:38:25.351]  You're an insider, you get waivers from the government healthcare mandate.
[01:38:26.104 --> 01:38:30.727]  You're an insider, your power plant stays open.
[01:38:30.727 --> 01:38:33.829]  Gun laws, without having a law.
[01:38:33.829 --> 01:38:35.490]  Wars without congressional approval.
[01:38:35.490 --> 01:38:36.210]  300,000 illegals.
[01:38:38.377 --> 01:38:40.778]  The president says I'm just going to release them.
[01:38:40.778 --> 01:38:42.618]  Maybe I'll keep a few felons back.
[01:38:42.618 --> 01:38:43.498]  I don't need Congress.
[01:38:43.498 --> 01:38:45.679]  I'll violate federal immigration law.
[01:38:45.679 --> 01:38:55.561]  We are entering a time of complete lawlessness because the globalists have imploded us by design and they've got to bring in a tyranny or they're all going to go to prison.
[01:38:55.561 --> 01:38:57.681]  Came out the SEC last week.
[01:38:57.681 --> 01:38:59.201]  Even the Associated Press reported.
[01:38:59.201 --> 01:39:02.642]  Destroyed thousands of documents and hundreds of investigations.
[01:39:02.642 --> 01:39:06.743]  People bring them evidence of fraud inside the good old boy club.
[01:39:07.583 --> 01:39:12.885]  The organized crime, the offshore banks that run this country and Wall Street, they're exempt.
[01:39:12.885 --> 01:39:14.186]  You want to sell lemonade?
[01:39:14.186 --> 01:39:16.247]  You're going to get your wrist broken.
[01:39:16.247 --> 01:39:18.288]  You're going to prison!
[01:39:18.288 --> 01:39:20.228]  You're going to jail!
[01:39:20.228 --> 01:39:22.269]  You're Amish selling neighbor's cheese?
[01:39:22.269 --> 01:39:25.951]  One year, million dollar investigation to act like it's illegal.
[01:39:28.035 --> 01:39:39.143]  Gerald Solente joins us as America becomes North Korea and as they openly call to start censoring the internet and shut down most of the cell phones in the area of San Francisco because a peaceful protest was happening.
[01:39:39.143 --> 01:39:40.044]  It's unbelievable.
[01:39:40.044 --> 01:39:41.885]  So much is going on.
[01:39:41.885 --> 01:39:42.666]  Gerald Solente
[01:39:43.446 --> 01:39:44.127]  He is our guest.
[01:39:44.127 --> 01:39:47.408]  He'll be with us for 20 minutes of the next hour, so for the next 45 minutes.
[01:39:47.408 --> 01:39:49.590]  TrendsResearch.com.
[01:39:49.590 --> 01:40:00.476]  He is an American trends forecaster, publisher of the Trends Journal, business consultant, and author who makes predictions about global financial markets and other events of historical importance.
[01:40:00.476 --> 01:40:03.718]  And he's described himself as a political atheist and a citizen of the world.
[01:40:03.718 --> 01:40:10.742]  He has appeared as a guest on Oprah Winfrey Show, Glenn Beck, you name it, NBC Nightly News, TrendsResearch.com.
[01:40:10.742 --> 01:40:11.122]  And again,
[01:40:13.564 --> 01:40:15.105]  It was a dead cat bounce.
[01:40:15.105 --> 01:40:20.908]  He said by the end of 2010, you're going to know we're in a depression.
[01:40:20.908 --> 01:40:31.254]  And every real housing number, jobless number, social security, COLA number, every inflation number, every single number,
[01:40:32.182 --> 01:40:37.267]  Show that by every classical benchmark, we were in a depression.
[01:40:37.267 --> 01:40:42.753]  And when the government didn't announce a depression in December, some people said, oh, look, so let me say we'd be in a depression.
[01:40:42.753 --> 01:40:45.776]  Well, now they're saying it's the greatest recession.
[01:40:45.776 --> 01:40:51.162]  And the former head of the private Federal Reserve told me the press, don't worry, we won't default.
[01:40:51.162 --> 01:40:52.584]  We'll just print more money.
[01:40:52.584 --> 01:40:53.424]  That is a default.
[01:40:54.806 --> 01:40:58.109]  Just unbelievable things are now being admitted.
[01:40:58.109 --> 01:40:59.291]  I wish that I was wrong.
[01:40:59.291 --> 01:41:03.835]  I wish Gerald was wrong, but he's been absolutely right and he had the guts.
[01:41:07.586 --> 01:41:13.169]  The Cajones, the Huevos, to actually put a date on it.
[01:41:13.169 --> 01:41:22.633]  And so, what happened is, we were in the Big Depression by the time he said we would be, but they said that, no, no, no, no, no, everything's fine.
[01:41:22.633 --> 01:41:31.857]  And still they're saying, well, we're in the greatest recession, but don't worry, everything's gonna be okay, as they simply stall while they put their police state in.
[01:41:31.857 --> 01:41:34.318]  Gerald Cilente, break it down for us, please, sir.
[01:41:35.282 --> 01:41:36.642]  Well, you hit on it, Alex.
[01:41:36.642 --> 01:41:38.403]  They're covering it up.
[01:41:38.403 --> 01:41:41.164]  This came out of Bloomberg yesterday.
[01:41:41.164 --> 01:41:43.585]  It's not in today's Wall Street Journal.
[01:41:43.585 --> 01:41:47.626]  It's not in that toilet paper record, the New York Times.
[01:41:47.626 --> 01:41:50.867]  And it's not even in the Financial Times.
[01:41:50.867 --> 01:41:59.350]  Wall Street aristocracy got $1.2 trillion in Fed secret loans.
[01:42:02.264 --> 01:42:12.902]  That's what they did, as all these banks like JPMorgan Chase, like the Goldman Sachs gang, like the Citigroup criminals.
[01:42:14.113 --> 01:42:23.361]  Like the Barclay Bandits, who all said, hey, our balance sheets are okay, things are really fine.
[01:42:23.361 --> 01:42:28.565]  They were getting tens of billions of dollars worth of loans.
[01:42:28.565 --> 01:42:32.268]  Alex, loans like you would get, and maybe I'll charge you 1%.
[01:42:33.709 --> 01:42:36.650]  Because you're one of the white shoe boys.
[01:42:36.650 --> 01:42:39.631]  They keep propping up this Ponzi scheme.
[01:42:39.631 --> 01:42:41.812]  And they keep lying to us.
[01:42:41.812 --> 01:42:47.755]  And the only reason these numbers just came out is because of the Dodd-Frank bill.
[01:42:47.755 --> 01:42:50.756]  But there's that clause in there, you know.
[01:42:50.756 --> 01:42:53.137]  The insanity clause.
[01:42:53.137 --> 01:42:57.559]  We gotta wait two years before we release these numbers because
[01:42:58.399 --> 01:43:06.685]  You know, we don't want people to see the real truth, and they may pull their money out of these criminal organizations.
[01:43:06.685 --> 01:43:11.228]  So they give us this baloney that that's why they can't put out these numbers.
[01:43:11.228 --> 01:43:13.070]  And this is only what we're seeing!
[01:43:13.610 --> 01:43:17.455]  Look what Obama, look where he's on that vacation again, you know?
[01:43:17.455 --> 01:43:20.038]  Where did he spend last night?
[01:43:20.038 --> 01:43:22.842]  Oh, at the prostitute's house!
[01:43:22.842 --> 01:43:25.805]  That's right, the guy that owns NBC!
[01:43:25.805 --> 01:43:27.327]  Comcast!
[01:43:27.327 --> 01:43:30.772]  It's all one club, and we're not in it!
[01:43:31.312 --> 01:43:35.376]  And you were talking about Venezuela and North Korea.
[01:43:35.376 --> 01:43:36.237]  No, no.
[01:43:36.237 --> 01:43:38.779]  This is fascism USA.
[01:43:38.779 --> 01:43:41.202]  I said it when Obama got elected.
[01:43:41.202 --> 01:43:44.145]  I said it when you did the Obama deception.
[01:43:44.145 --> 01:43:45.766]  And that's what it is.
[01:43:45.766 --> 01:43:50.130]  It's the merger of state and corporate powers.
[01:43:50.130 --> 01:43:51.071]  You point it out.
[01:43:51.992 --> 01:43:56.096]  All the breaks that the big guys get, like General Electric.
[01:43:56.096 --> 01:43:58.239]  You know, like all of them.
[01:43:58.239 --> 01:44:02.903]  They get the allowances while they're screwing the little people.
[01:44:02.903 --> 01:44:06.307]  You mentioned it, the lemonade stands, the cheese.
[01:44:06.307 --> 01:44:13.895]  How about that Rawsome Foods incident that you reported on a couple of weeks ago in Los Angeles?
[01:44:14.335 --> 01:44:26.943]  Where the food Gestapo came in and busted them and they were only supposed to take representative samples of what they was, what they, it's a club, they weren't even selling this stuff.
[01:44:26.943 --> 01:44:28.985]  You belong to a club.
[01:44:28.985 --> 01:44:29.885]  And what do they do?
[01:44:29.885 --> 01:44:35.129]  A representative sample happened to be every piece of article in the joint.
[01:44:35.129 --> 01:44:39.392]  So now as I'm speaking, look at the price of gold. $1,800.
[01:44:43.314 --> 01:44:46.095]  And $89 an ounce.
[01:44:46.095 --> 01:44:53.318]  And we had forecast at the beginning of this year, among all the major media, $2,000 an ounce.
[01:44:53.318 --> 01:44:55.339]  Why is it going up?
[01:44:55.339 --> 01:44:57.560]  One simple reason.
[01:44:57.560 --> 01:45:05.904]  The entire global financial system is collapsing, and only the little children believe that it's going to be safe.
[01:45:05.904 --> 01:45:07.524]  And let me throw this at you.
[01:45:07.524 --> 01:45:08.385]  Let me throw this at you.
[01:45:08.985 --> 01:45:14.832]  Because you did predict 2000 by the end of the year, a bold prediction.
[01:45:14.832 --> 01:45:17.516]  That was a long time ago you made that prediction.
[01:45:17.516 --> 01:45:26.747]  And it's because you've been proven right that they're not going to be inviting you on all these shows and all these newspapers aren't going to interview you that called you a pessimist porno.
[01:45:27.748 --> 01:45:38.357]  Dealer just like the Pew Research showed Ron Paul is getting less coverage than any other candidate including candidates that have dropped out Because in reality he's in the top three candidates.
[01:45:38.357 --> 01:45:48.186]  He's a major front-runner, and he's been right so they're going to ignore him, but when you're a liar Well, then they'll put you on national television
[01:45:49.082 --> 01:45:52.486]  It's because it's the houses of prostitution.
[01:45:52.486 --> 01:45:55.530]  They're just there to serve their masters.
[01:45:55.530 --> 01:46:04.242]  You just saw Obama make a trip to the master's house at Comcast just yesterday, up at Martha's Vineyard.
[01:46:04.702 --> 01:46:07.203]  And that's all it is, and I'm not a member.
[01:46:07.203 --> 01:46:11.804]  Yeah, I told you, I think it also might be, I think maybe they don't like the way I dress.
[01:46:11.804 --> 01:46:14.805]  And I don't wear those Brooks Brothers suits, you know?
[01:46:14.805 --> 01:46:19.946]  And maybe this Celente doesn't ring right with them, or that Bronx accent.
[01:46:19.946 --> 01:46:24.948]  So I'm going to become maybe Jay Endicott Prescott III.
[01:46:24.948 --> 01:46:30.769]  And if that doesn't work, maybe Josh O'Shaughnessy Greenberg.
[01:46:30.769 --> 01:46:32.930]  Then I'd really be brilliant, you know?
[01:46:33.490 --> 01:46:44.083]  Why don't you just start talking like Thurston Alva III and change your name to Winford Springfield Dimitri Rockefeller the 17th?
[01:46:44.083 --> 01:46:46.466]  Oh, Buffy, look!
[01:46:46.466 --> 01:46:48.990]  Why don't you start talking like that?
[01:46:50.336 --> 01:46:54.639]  Yeah, they got these guys on CNBC every day, you know?
[01:46:54.639 --> 01:46:55.219]  Are you kidding?
[01:46:55.219 --> 01:46:57.040]  It's like, it's a comic.
[01:46:57.040 --> 01:47:02.004]  So going back to what's going on, let's look what's going on over in Europe.
[01:47:02.004 --> 01:47:03.965]  The game is over.
[01:47:03.965 --> 01:47:05.966]  They're talking about euro bonds.
[01:47:05.966 --> 01:47:07.648]  Merkel doesn't want to do it.
[01:47:07.648 --> 01:47:09.549]  Nobody really does.
[01:47:09.549 --> 01:47:10.870]  So that's collapsing.
[01:47:10.870 --> 01:47:12.991]  Where are they going to get the money?
[01:47:12.991 --> 01:47:14.612]  They're at zero interest rates.
[01:47:14.612 --> 01:47:19.415]  So as we're talking, the stock market took a little pop up today.
[01:47:19.415 --> 01:47:19.796]  Why?
[01:47:20.898 --> 01:47:27.736]  This is what they have the gall to say on the good news that Ben Bernanke
[01:47:28.991 --> 01:47:33.855]  May announce QE3 by the end of the week.
[01:47:33.855 --> 01:47:34.976]  The good news!
[01:47:34.976 --> 01:47:35.836]  Great!
[01:47:35.836 --> 01:47:40.000]  More digital money, not worth the paper it's not printed on.
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:54.051]  We'll keep those interest rates near zero so all you people out there that used to put money in the bank and think you were going to get a return on it, you're not going to get anything unless you invest in the Ponzi scheme called
[01:47:54.471 --> 01:47:57.652]  Wall Street, the whole system is collapsing.
[01:47:57.652 --> 01:48:03.373]  And you mentioned about Biden being over in China, sucking up and bowing down.
[01:48:03.373 --> 01:48:05.633]  There's a photo of him last week.
[01:48:05.633 --> 01:48:07.333]  He's walking down the gangplank.
[01:48:07.333 --> 01:48:09.514]  You know, there's, what, Air Force Two?
[01:48:09.514 --> 01:48:14.075]  You know, this plane is big enough to move half a city, you know?
[01:48:14.075 --> 01:48:17.455]  And he's holding the hand of this young, attractive woman.
[01:48:17.455 --> 01:48:18.455]  I say, wow, who's that?
[01:48:18.455 --> 01:48:21.456]  And at the end, it's his granddaughter.
[01:48:22.196 --> 01:48:23.397]  Naomi.
[01:48:23.397 --> 01:48:27.341]  And here, you know, they got all these guys saluting the red carpet.
[01:48:27.341 --> 01:48:29.263]  What kind of baloney is this?
[01:48:29.263 --> 01:48:31.925]  I thought he's going over there to do business.
[01:48:31.925 --> 01:48:34.347]  He takes his granddaughter with him, you know?
[01:48:34.347 --> 01:48:36.329]  And who's paying for this stuff?
[01:48:36.329 --> 01:48:38.571]  It's the same like Hillary Clinton.
[01:48:38.571 --> 01:48:44.337]  She sent Chelsea to the soccer game, you know, to cheer on the team.
[01:48:44.337 --> 01:48:46.378]  Everybody get this straight.
[01:48:47.386 --> 01:48:49.888]  You have a royalty in this country.
[01:48:49.888 --> 01:48:54.711]  Harvard, Princeton, Yale, the Bullets, Banks and Bombs Club.
[01:48:54.711 --> 01:49:01.655]  And the only time when they want you is for cannon fodder and to pick your pocket.
[01:49:01.655 --> 01:49:11.621]  So people that believe that you're going to have change you could believe in, whether voting for the Republicans and the Democrats, you're
[01:49:11.761 --> 01:49:15.222]  Better grow up if you haven't grown up by now.
[01:49:15.222 --> 01:49:15.762]  Absolutely.
[01:49:15.762 --> 01:49:19.043]  I want to play a clip for you and get your take on it.
[01:49:19.043 --> 01:49:32.387]  To have Greenspan on Meet the Prestitutes to adopt your term that I'm noticing is now becoming popularized, so you've actually coined a phrase that's now going to be in popular use.
[01:49:32.387 --> 01:49:36.688]  They say that's a real sign of true influence, so congratulations.
[01:49:36.688 --> 01:49:40.609]  Prestitutes, and I hope our listeners will start using it, he was on Meet the Prestitutes
[01:49:41.269 --> 01:49:45.532]  And he said, hey, don't worry, we're not going to default, we'll just print money.
[01:49:45.532 --> 01:49:55.958]  And they had the former White House financial advisor on there, Goolsby, and he literally got shaken up and couldn't believe that Greenspan just said that.
[01:49:55.958 --> 01:50:04.803]  So they've got the chutzpah, the arrogance to come right out in the open and say, we're going to devalue the dollar down to nothing.
[01:50:04.803 --> 01:50:05.683]  Let's play that clip.
[01:50:05.683 --> 01:50:06.504]  Here it is.
[01:50:06.504 --> 01:50:07.224]  Are U.S.
[01:50:07.224 --> 01:50:10.446]  Treasury bonds still safe to invest in?
[01:50:11.255 --> 01:50:12.156]  Very much so.
[01:50:12.156 --> 01:50:18.063]  I think there's a... This is not an issue of credit rating.
[01:50:18.063 --> 01:50:25.111]  The United States can pay any debt it has because we can always print money to do that.
[01:50:25.111 --> 01:50:28.455]  So there is zero probability of default.
[01:50:29.488 --> 01:50:29.608]  What?
[01:51:01.049 --> 01:51:01.389]  We're good.

[01:52:01.949 --> 01:52:06.633]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[01:52:06.633 --> 01:52:13.080]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[01:52:13.080 --> 01:52:15.342]  Number one, study the past.
[01:52:15.342 --> 01:52:17.744]  History really does repeat itself.
[01:52:17.744 --> 01:52:21.467]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[01:52:22.597 --> 01:52:25.680]  Number three, take decisive action.
[01:52:25.680 --> 01:52:29.523]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[01:52:29.523 --> 01:52:34.567]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[01:52:34.567 --> 01:52:37.990]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[01:52:38.570 --> 01:52:41.971]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[01:52:41.971 --> 01:52:46.472]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:52:46.472 --> 01:52:51.394]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.

[01:52:56.015 --> 01:52:58.176]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:53:00.555 --> 01:53:02.096]  Meet Jerry D. Hi.
[01:53:02.096 --> 01:53:11.263]  Jerry and his family, like you, are very concerned about world conditions and have gathered many emergency preparedness items, including turtle tuft shelters.
[01:53:11.263 --> 01:53:20.429]  We have added two 24-foot turtle tufts to our supplies and feel very secure knowing our large family is ready for whatever the future may bring.
[01:53:20.765 --> 01:53:23.287]  TurtleTuff shelters are not tents.
[01:53:23.287 --> 01:53:33.353]  They are permanent yet portable four-season geodesic frame shelters that are as strong as a cabin at a fraction of the cost and are easy to set up, take down, and move anywhere.
[01:53:33.353 --> 01:53:34.994]  Available in two sizes.
[01:53:34.994 --> 01:53:39.877]  Get your TurtleTuff shelter and accessories included at TurtleTuffShelters.com.

[01:54:08.058 --> 01:54:16.301]  Okay, our lines are loaded, but when you hear a caller hang up, or start taking your calls in the next hour for Gerald Cilente, that's your chance to get on board.
[01:54:16.301 --> 01:54:17.162]  We'd love to hear from you.
[01:54:17.162 --> 01:54:17.682]  800-259-9231.
[01:54:17.682 --> 01:54:22.023]  I've got a host of other issues I want to hit Gerald Cilente's brain on.
[01:54:26.746 --> 01:54:33.956]  But Gerald, finishing up with that clip we just played before the break of Greenspan with a very arrogant look on his face.
[01:54:33.956 --> 01:54:40.845]  This is the guy that told Laird NewsHour that the Federal Reserve is above the law at its own branch of government.
[01:54:40.845 --> 01:54:43.328]  Gee, I didn't read that in the Constitution, plus it's private.
[01:54:43.789 --> 01:54:45.910]  I mean, when does it end?
[01:54:45.910 --> 01:54:54.272]  Because they're old men and look like they've been put in a microwave and are wearing suits, we've got to just let them gut and destroy everything?
[01:54:54.272 --> 01:55:04.115]  What does it signify that they're talking about just printing money to a Weimar Republic level and that they're openly talking about QE3, Gerald?
[01:55:05.535 --> 01:55:08.577]  Well again, now what is gold at?
[01:55:08.577 --> 01:55:14.559]  Now it's $1,891 an ounce.
[01:55:14.559 --> 01:55:16.340]  So that's what they're doing.
[01:55:16.340 --> 01:55:20.362]  Maybe, you remember in the old Weimar Republic they had the wheelbarrows?
[01:55:20.362 --> 01:55:23.344]  Maybe we could have Bernanke barrows now.
[01:55:23.344 --> 01:55:29.847]  So you could load them up, we'll put bungee cords on them to hold the money in, so you could buy a loaf of bread.
[01:55:29.847 --> 01:55:31.848]  There's not one thing I agree with
[01:55:32.228 --> 01:55:37.534]  With that guy Rick Perry over there that's running for president, except this one thing.
[01:55:37.534 --> 01:55:42.219]  About him saying that Bernanke should be brought up for treason.
[01:55:42.219 --> 01:55:46.363]  And so should this other guy, Greenspan.
[01:55:46.363 --> 01:55:50.508]  And by the way, everything that these guys predicted has been wrong.
[01:55:50.908 --> 01:55:55.349]  Just for the record, but they keep bringing them back for their expertise.
[01:55:55.349 --> 01:55:59.570]  They are robbing the people in front of our eyes.
[01:55:59.570 --> 01:56:04.431]  I read to you that piece on Bloomberg that was reported yesterday.
[01:56:04.431 --> 01:56:15.114]  $1.2 trillion going to JPMorgan Chase, going to Credit Suisse, Societe Generale.
[01:56:15.794 --> 01:56:17.115]  Barclays!
[01:56:17.115 --> 01:56:20.456]  And not a nickel for you or a nickel for me!
[01:56:20.456 --> 01:56:22.657]  No, no, our tax money had to pay for this.
[01:56:22.657 --> 01:56:26.999]  By the way, MSNBC got hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:56:26.999 --> 01:56:34.282]  And as you said earlier, and I have the article here, who does he go visit but the head of Comcast that owns MSNBC?
[01:56:34.282 --> 01:56:38.744]  And literally the subsidiaries they took control of are getting government money.
[01:56:39.564 --> 01:56:42.606]  And so they talk about other people having state-run media.
[01:56:42.606 --> 01:56:44.448]  We have state-run media.
[01:56:44.448 --> 01:56:47.850]  It's just foreign banker-run through the state.
[01:56:47.850 --> 01:56:49.991]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:56:49.991 --> 01:56:51.412]  It's state-run media.
[01:56:51.412 --> 01:56:52.133]  You have it.
[01:56:52.133 --> 01:56:57.797]  By the way, if anybody wants to get a glimpse of what's going on over in Libya,
[01:56:58.357 --> 01:57:08.306]  I suggest you tune in to RT, you know, Russia Today, because they're the only ones that are giving another side of the story.
[01:57:08.306 --> 01:57:14.111]  And just like the prostitutes got us into that Iraq War, remember that one?
[01:57:14.531 --> 01:57:18.434]  Remember Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction?
[01:57:18.434 --> 01:57:25.738]  Remember Katie Couric on the Today Show walking across that map on the floor with that other prostitute?
[01:57:25.738 --> 01:57:32.663]  What's that guy, that former general they always dredge up all the time to send the people to war?
[01:57:33.323 --> 01:57:46.291]  And they do it all, remember the New York Times, the paper, the toilet paper, a record about Saddam Hussein's yellow cape, and of aluminum tubes.
[01:57:46.291 --> 01:57:48.092]  They're liars.
[01:57:48.092 --> 01:57:49.493]  All they're doing is what
[01:57:49.773 --> 01:57:52.494]  Every prestitute does!
[01:57:52.494 --> 01:57:55.114]  They serve their masters!
[01:57:55.114 --> 01:58:02.976]  And if you were to put them all together, you wouldn't come up with one pair of cojones among them all!
[01:58:02.976 --> 01:58:16.779]  They're all suck-ups and sellouts, and they're selling out this country, and your children out there, they're gonna be next, because the next war, they're gonna need more cannon fodder.
[01:58:17.179 --> 01:58:22.624]  So keep pumping out those babies and keep spending your money for these wars.
[01:58:22.624 --> 01:58:24.846]  What are we going into now?
[01:58:24.846 --> 01:58:25.566]  Oh, 9-11!
[01:58:25.566 --> 01:58:29.990]  Big celebrations are coming up in New York City in a couple of weeks.
[01:58:29.990 --> 01:58:38.997]  But CNN's reporting that the 9-11 victims and the first responders are barred from being there.
[01:58:38.997 --> 01:58:42.560]  That's right, stay with us.
[01:58:42.560 --> 01:58:44.282]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:58:52.037 --> 01:58:53.737]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:58:53.737 --> 01:58:59.038]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:58:59.038 --> 01:59:00.579]  Saving means to make money.
[01:59:00.579 --> 01:59:09.361]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:59:10.101 --> 01:59:17.647]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:59:17.647 --> 01:59:25.654]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:59:25.654 --> 01:59:30.878]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[01:59:56.334 --> 01:59:59.096]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.697 --> 02:00:10.538]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.538 --> 02:00:12.118]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.118 --> 02:00:13.659]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.659 --> 02:00:17.860]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.860 --> 02:00:22.040]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.040 --> 02:00:27.602]  Alright, coming up in the next segment, your calls for Gerald Cilente.
[02:00:32.213 --> 02:00:35.754]  I read on the radio yesterday the CNN headline.
[02:00:35.754 --> 02:00:36.995]  We're going to dig it back up.
[02:00:36.995 --> 02:00:37.875]  People won't believe it.
[02:00:37.875 --> 02:00:45.618]  9-11 first responders barred from 10th anniversary ceremony.
[02:00:45.618 --> 02:00:48.359]  And we were able to find another article.
[02:00:48.359 --> 02:00:49.299]  What's the source of that?
[02:00:50.711 --> 02:00:51.551]  That's Fox News.
[02:00:51.551 --> 02:00:56.954]  9-1-1 first responders to be excluded from 10th anniversary ceremony.
[02:00:56.954 --> 02:00:58.694]  The actual heroes.
[02:00:58.694 --> 02:01:06.898]  Either way you slice what really happened on 9-11, these men and women are heroes that went in and tried to save people and so many of them died.
[02:01:06.898 --> 02:01:15.602]  And because so many of them are angry that they've been excluded from health care and been lied to about asbestos, they're barred from it.
[02:01:15.602 --> 02:01:17.983]  And then the prostitutes and the whore criminal
[02:01:18.803 --> 02:01:28.462]  Government are going to sit up there and sell a police state and their wars on the memory of the dead and the first responders aren't allowed to be there.
[02:01:28.462 --> 02:01:30.145]  What do you make of that, Gerald?
[02:01:32.170 --> 02:01:37.473]  And let's go back and watch what you're going to hear when all of these ceremonies take place.
[02:01:37.473 --> 02:01:43.216]  You know how they used to say, and again, as you said, any way you slice it, these are the facts.
[02:01:43.216 --> 02:01:49.300]  The World Trade Centers came down, the symbol of America's financial might.
[02:01:49.300 --> 02:01:53.162]  Hey, Alex, take a look at the Dow as we speak.
[02:01:53.162 --> 02:01:55.323]  It's at 2,000 levels.
[02:01:55.323 --> 02:01:57.244]  Guess the terrorist won.
[02:01:57.244 --> 02:01:59.906]  Oh, Alex, here's another one for you.
[02:02:00.726 --> 02:02:04.867]  Ten years later, they still haven't rebuilt the damn thing.
[02:02:04.867 --> 02:02:08.488]  Hey, that really shows your progress, doesn't it?
[02:02:08.488 --> 02:02:10.748]  More of that impressive progress.
[02:02:10.748 --> 02:02:19.970]  That Petraeus, you know, that general, that now they've merged the CIA and the Defense Department, now he's the head of the CIA.
[02:02:19.970 --> 02:02:23.891]  But when he was running the war in Afghanistan, impressive progress.
[02:02:23.891 --> 02:02:30.012]  Remember, they whacked General Headquarters, regardless how you believe it happened, whether it happened or not.
[02:02:30.712 --> 02:02:32.674]  They hate the damn thing!
[02:02:32.674 --> 02:02:34.595]  The terrorists are winning!
[02:02:34.595 --> 02:02:35.176]  They won!
[02:02:35.176 --> 02:02:38.799]  Look what happens to us when we go to the airports!
[02:02:38.799 --> 02:02:40.480]  They x-ray us!
[02:02:40.480 --> 02:02:42.282]  They feel us up!
[02:02:42.282 --> 02:02:44.303]  They pat us down!
[02:02:44.303 --> 02:02:46.185]  Look at the Patriot Act!
[02:02:46.585 --> 02:02:49.709]  We have no more constitutional rights.
[02:02:49.709 --> 02:02:51.991]  The terrorists won.
[02:02:51.991 --> 02:02:56.917]  You won't hear any of this when they have the celebrations.
[02:02:56.917 --> 02:03:04.004]  We've lost how much since that time on the wonderful war on terror.
[02:03:04.004 --> 02:03:05.046]  Now we have
[02:03:05.606 --> 02:03:08.508]  Homeland Security!
[02:03:08.508 --> 02:03:10.270]  The terrorists won!
[02:03:10.270 --> 02:03:10.910]  Well, that's it.
[02:03:10.910 --> 02:03:16.955]  They're going to be celebrating how they used the terror attacks to fully gut the country and take all of our freedoms.
[02:03:16.955 --> 02:03:18.796]  So, it is a celebration.
[02:03:18.796 --> 02:03:21.038]  So, of course, they don't want the first responders there.
[02:03:21.038 --> 02:03:22.779]  They're Al-Qaeda.
[02:03:22.779 --> 02:03:28.463]  In fact, guys, print me the article, first responders to get medical care had to be put through a terror database.
[02:03:28.463 --> 02:03:31.406]  Finally, Congress passed a law to give them some basic health care.
[02:03:32.136 --> 02:03:35.877]  When they've done the CAT scans, it's admitted their lungs are full of asbestos, you name it.
[02:03:35.877 --> 02:03:42.200]  But they have to go through a terror database every time before they get health care, like they're terrorists.
[02:03:42.200 --> 02:03:43.560]  Again, this is what happens.
[02:03:43.560 --> 02:03:46.161]  It's the merger of state and corporate powers.
[02:03:46.161 --> 02:03:48.402]  Fascism has come to America.
[02:03:48.402 --> 02:03:50.383]  Call a spade a spade.
[02:03:50.383 --> 02:03:53.944]  Again, look what's happened to this country since 9-11.
[02:03:53.944 --> 02:03:56.645]  It was bad before, but now it's terrible.
[02:03:58.177 --> 02:04:00.898]  Oh, by the way, Alex, let me interject.
[02:04:00.898 --> 02:04:03.699]  Every now and then I get these emails from people.
[02:04:03.699 --> 02:04:07.000]  Hey, listen, Salenti, if you don't like it here, leave.
[02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:07.860]  And you know what?
[02:04:07.860 --> 02:04:09.541]  I got news for them.
[02:04:09.541 --> 02:04:10.841]  You leave.
[02:04:10.841 --> 02:04:13.902]  You're the guys that are screwing the joint up.
[02:04:13.902 --> 02:04:16.843]  You're the ones that are changing the Constitution.
[02:04:16.843 --> 02:04:18.984]  Don't tell me to leave, Jackson.
[02:04:18.984 --> 02:04:26.146]  You pack up your gear with the rest of your fascist buddies and go someplace else where you'll feel at home.
[02:04:27.190 --> 02:04:27.731]  I love it.
[02:04:27.731 --> 02:04:28.252]  Absolutely.
[02:04:28.252 --> 02:04:30.334]  I defend the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:04:30.334 --> 02:04:32.657]  And then people say, if you don't love it, leave it.
[02:04:32.657 --> 02:04:35.181]  I'm trying to defend what America's supposed to be.
[02:04:35.181 --> 02:04:40.868]  They're bringing in all this alien, anti-freedom garbage and telling us to shut up and take it, Gerald.
[02:04:40.868 --> 02:04:41.629]  So absolutely.
[02:04:42.130 --> 02:04:46.714]  Back your stuff up, go to a deserted island, and you vampires can all feed on each other.
[02:04:46.714 --> 02:04:48.356]  Oh, but you don't want that.
[02:04:48.356 --> 02:04:50.718]  You want to suck this country dry first.
[02:04:50.718 --> 02:04:52.719]  We're in a race to kick the globalists out of here.
[02:04:52.719 --> 02:04:53.720]  Gerald, stay there.
[02:04:53.720 --> 02:04:57.083]  I want to get your take on Libya, and then go to phone calls on the other side.
[02:04:57.083 --> 02:04:57.544]  Stay with us.
[02:05:02.956 --> 02:05:05.118]  You're subject to public police action.
[02:05:05.118 --> 02:05:06.379]  Tyranny is here.
[02:05:06.379 --> 02:05:10.322]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:05:10.322 --> 02:05:12.544]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:05:12.544 --> 02:05:17.948]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:05:18.408 --> 02:05:25.070]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:05:25.070 --> 02:05:31.033]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:05:31.033 --> 02:05:34.734]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:05:35.234 --> 02:05:39.515]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:05:39.515 --> 02:05:45.457]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:05:45.457 --> 02:05:49.019]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:05:49.019 --> 02:05:50.999]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:05:50.999 --> 02:05:52.120]  It's here.

[02:06:36.672 --> 02:06:38.752]  You know you need your own food.

[02:06:46.814 --> 02:06:48.314]  This sale ends Friday, August 26th.
[02:06:48.314 --> 02:06:51.214]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[02:07:01.124 --> 02:07:07.788]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:07:07.788 --> 02:07:12.931]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:07:12.931 --> 02:07:21.655]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:07:21.655 --> 02:07:25.718]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:07:25.718 --> 02:07:28.059]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:07:39.815 --> 02:07:41.956]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:07:41.956 --> 02:07:43.737]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:07:43.737 --> 02:07:46.618]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:07:46.618 --> 02:07:50.860]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[02:07:50.860 --> 02:07:53.241]  So you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:07:53.241 --> 02:07:55.942]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:07:55.942 --> 02:07:57.543]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:07:57.543 --> 02:07:58.323]  Got it.
[02:07:58.323 --> 02:07:59.204]  Others don't.
[02:08:02.068 --> 02:08:04.835]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:04.835 --> 02:08:07.642]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:19.642 --> 02:08:23.763]  TrendsResearch.com is the excellent website of Gerald Cilente.
[02:08:23.763 --> 02:08:28.424]  You can also go to the site and subscribe to the Trends Journal itself.
[02:08:28.424 --> 02:08:29.845]  Invaluable information.
[02:08:29.845 --> 02:08:35.406]  You can also, of course, visit our websites, InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:08:35.406 --> 02:08:44.809]  I want to get to a few calls while Gerald Cilente is with us, but putting it back on screen, the Fox News headline, 9-1-1 first responders to be excluded.
[02:08:45.729 --> 02:08:55.974]  From 10th anniversary ceremony, because it's seen that they are disgruntled about the fact the government knowingly lied about the deadly dust.
[02:08:55.974 --> 02:08:58.875]  Well, you shouldn't have believed the government, guys.
[02:08:58.875 --> 02:09:01.817]  And that it's seen that they're hostile to the government now.
[02:09:01.817 --> 02:09:09.781]  Now, when I've been down at Ground Zero a couple years after it happened and was saying 9-11 was an inside job, about half the folks were getting mad at me.
[02:09:09.781 --> 02:09:12.082]  Firemen, police, folks like that.
[02:09:13.311 --> 02:09:19.033]  The last time I was there two, three years ago, they were all patting me on the back, shaking my hand.
[02:09:19.033 --> 02:09:25.556]  Captains and fire department commanders and police commanders were nodding and smiling and saying, we appreciate you, Alex.
[02:09:25.556 --> 02:09:26.396]  We know, we know.
[02:09:26.396 --> 02:09:28.337]  And I was like, say that on tape.
[02:09:28.337 --> 02:09:30.498]  It was like, no, just know we know.
[02:09:30.498 --> 02:09:31.979]  It was incredible.
[02:09:32.939 --> 02:09:35.221]  And I'm not getting Gerald off into that.
[02:09:35.221 --> 02:09:38.844]  The point is, is that that's why they're excluded.
[02:09:38.844 --> 02:09:41.627]  Fox News, AP, Reuters.
[02:09:41.627 --> 02:09:45.810]  Again, the first responder heroes, ten years later, are excluded.
[02:09:45.810 --> 02:09:46.971]  Why?
[02:09:46.971 --> 02:09:51.715]  Because the vast majority of them know that those buildings were all blown sky-high.
[02:09:51.715 --> 02:09:52.816]  And they know they're angry.
[02:09:52.816 --> 02:09:54.418]  They got their phones tapped.
[02:09:54.418 --> 02:09:55.639]  You name it.
[02:09:55.639 --> 02:09:56.759]  Okay?
[02:09:56.759 --> 02:09:57.940]  Now, Gerald digressing,
[02:09:59.404 --> 02:10:01.346]  into another area.
[02:10:01.346 --> 02:10:22.905]  It just came out in the Nation Magazine that Stratfor, a large and establishment global intelligence, private intelligence group, that's been around for a very long time, based in Austin, Texas, has come out, and the Nation Magazine's reporting, Stratfor disputes OBL killing in Obamabod
[02:10:23.806 --> 02:10:29.192]  And it goes on to say, globally recognized intelligence and forecast Stratfor has rejected the U.S.
[02:10:29.192 --> 02:10:33.718]  Central Intelligence claim that the man killed in a bombabod compound by U.S.
[02:10:33.718 --> 02:10:36.921]  Navy SEALs was Al Qaeda Chief Osama Bin Laden.
[02:10:36.921 --> 02:10:43.028]  This was one of the reasons the CIA kept Pakistan's premier intelligence agency, Inner Service Intelligence, in the dark.
[02:10:43.869 --> 02:10:46.430]  And it goes on to say it's not true.
[02:10:46.430 --> 02:10:47.751]  Wow!
[02:10:47.751 --> 02:10:50.052]  My angel is it's totally fake.
[02:10:50.052 --> 02:10:56.535]  I know you've laughed at the cement shoe thing, but that's a big deal when somebody like Stratfor, because they're highly respected, comes out.
[02:10:56.535 --> 02:10:58.936]  Could we be coming to the end of the lies?
[02:10:58.936 --> 02:11:03.238]  Could people go ahead and realize there's no future if we don't stop going along with it?
[02:11:04.204 --> 02:11:05.304]  No.
[02:11:05.304 --> 02:11:06.545]  I don't see that happening.
[02:11:06.545 --> 02:11:07.665]  Not the way it is now.
[02:11:07.665 --> 02:11:09.666]  The whole game is so rigged.
[02:11:09.666 --> 02:11:11.666]  We have such little freedom.
[02:11:11.666 --> 02:11:14.587]  Where do we voice our discontent?
[02:11:14.587 --> 02:11:16.588]  You have the Republicans and the Democrats.
[02:11:16.588 --> 02:11:18.088]  You know how I feel about it.
[02:11:18.088 --> 02:11:19.808]  The Bananos or the Gambinos.
[02:11:19.808 --> 02:11:21.189]  That's your choice.
[02:11:21.189 --> 02:11:24.770]  No, it's not going to change until the individual changes, Alex.
[02:11:24.770 --> 02:11:26.910]  It's a much deeper issue than that.
[02:11:26.910 --> 02:11:27.771]  As I see it.
[02:11:27.771 --> 02:11:29.391]  That's my belief.
[02:11:29.391 --> 02:11:30.992]  I believe it's emotional.
[02:11:32.472 --> 02:11:37.353]  It's spiritual, it's physical, and it's emotional.
[02:11:37.353 --> 02:11:41.374]  And until those levels change, morality has to come back.
[02:11:41.374 --> 02:11:44.234]  But people have to live that in their individual lives.
[02:11:44.234 --> 02:11:52.335]  And I'm not talking about this phony, you know, religious stuff, you know, where people tell you, you know, I know the real God, and this is what it says.
[02:11:52.335 --> 02:11:53.876]  I'm not talking about that one.
[02:11:53.876 --> 02:11:56.076]  I'm talking about the inner truth.
[02:11:56.076 --> 02:11:58.356]  And most people haven't reached that yet.
[02:11:58.356 --> 02:12:00.317]  You look at the state of the nation.
[02:12:01.457 --> 02:12:05.000]  You look at this presidential reality show going on.
[02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:06.282]  I mean, it's bad theater.
[02:12:06.282 --> 02:12:15.650]  I mean, every time you see one of these candidates that show up in a farm state, you think they could ever sit anywhere other than on a bale of hay?
[02:12:15.650 --> 02:12:18.012]  And the people keep buying this baloney.
[02:12:18.012 --> 02:12:20.094]  So it's until the individual changes.
[02:12:20.094 --> 02:12:22.476]  There's that wonderful Hindu saying,
[02:12:23.397 --> 02:12:27.322]  When the student's ready, the teacher appears.
[02:12:27.322 --> 02:12:31.808]  And right now, I don't believe that people are ready spiritually, emotionally, or physically.
[02:12:33.015 --> 02:12:33.955]  Well, I agree.
[02:12:33.955 --> 02:12:41.338]  The average man thinks that watching football is what it is to be a male, not to be informed, involved in their community.
[02:12:41.338 --> 02:12:55.023]  And, you know, I mean, real men, the old-fashioned icon of it was not wanting to be a chump, not being conned, being independent, and not trusting the government, and being involved in your community.
[02:12:55.023 --> 02:13:01.586]  Now, men just basically just run around acting like adolescents, women act like tarts, and is there any
[02:13:02.466 --> 02:13:02.706]  Exactly!
[02:13:09.592 --> 02:13:17.094]  It's the drugs too, and I'm not talking about... And let's stop this baloney, this war on drugs and busting people for pot.
[02:13:17.094 --> 02:13:18.955]  What a lot of crap that is.
[02:13:18.955 --> 02:13:27.197]  How about busting people for Xanax and all these wonderful drugs they put out there like, you know, Oxycontin.
[02:13:27.197 --> 02:13:29.337]  There's a good winner for you.
[02:13:29.337 --> 02:13:38.340]  So all these drugs, these ritalins and the tons of drugs that people are taking, the antidepressants, that's added into it as well.
[02:13:38.980 --> 02:13:46.262]  And as you mentioned about men, and this is, as I said, you know, people have an uprising in this country.
[02:13:46.262 --> 02:13:50.883]  These aren't just mommy's boys, they're soccer mommy's boys.
[02:13:50.883 --> 02:13:55.024]  Look at these guys, these prostitute reporters out there.
[02:13:55.024 --> 02:13:58.925]  I mean, again, you know, they're the goody two-shoes.
[02:13:58.925 --> 02:14:04.147]  I got an email from someone today that said they weren't renewing their subscription.
[02:14:04.147 --> 02:14:05.347]  I'm not making this one up.
[02:14:06.087 --> 02:14:16.771]  They said that although they bought gold in 2008, I think gold was trading for what, about $600, $700 back then?
[02:14:16.771 --> 02:14:20.612]  And although they were a little more, $800 I think.
[02:14:20.612 --> 02:14:22.713]  So it's double, more than double now.
[02:14:22.713 --> 02:14:27.295]  And they did very well on our forecast by believing the forecast.
[02:14:27.975 --> 02:14:36.378]  We haven't given enough information on how moms could do more to help their kids.
[02:14:36.378 --> 02:14:39.619]  How moms could do more?
[02:14:39.619 --> 02:14:43.260]  This is a soccer mommy society!
[02:14:43.260 --> 02:14:45.981]  Look at the TV shows!
[02:14:45.981 --> 02:14:47.662]  Look at the commercials!
[02:14:47.662 --> 02:14:57.525]  Have you ever seen a guy that could put one foot in front of his other without tripping over or being helped by some smart woman?
[02:14:57.925 --> 02:14:59.507]  Well, that's what I wanted to say.
[02:14:59.507 --> 02:15:14.144]  Women watch TV and men have bought into the role to act like goofballs, but women, so much of the time, really want to boss everybody around, on average, and they buy into this idea that they're the government enforcer and the government's their friend.
[02:15:14.144 --> 02:15:17.127]  And it was Hitler that said, first you get the women, then you've...
[02:15:18.008 --> 02:15:19.950]  You know, got the children, so follow the men.
[02:15:19.950 --> 02:15:21.592]  And it's really true.
[02:15:21.592 --> 02:15:23.874]  But hey, don't worry.
[02:15:23.874 --> 02:15:28.218]  I mean, look, Madison Avenue knows that women make about 80% of the purchases.
[02:15:28.218 --> 02:15:29.659]  It's not that women are dumb or bad.
[02:15:29.659 --> 02:15:30.940]  They've been targeted.
[02:15:30.940 --> 02:15:34.884]  And they've bought into the little narrative that Obama's going to help them and stuff.
[02:15:34.884 --> 02:15:38.967]  And they're going to enjoy the road warrior society that they've helped conjure.
[02:15:39.728 --> 02:15:42.231]  And again, the whole country's been feminized.
[02:15:42.231 --> 02:15:46.835]  And if it's not the women, then it's the little kids.
[02:15:46.835 --> 02:15:55.283]  I haven't met a little kid yet that isn't either amazing, brilliant, or special.
[02:15:56.283 --> 02:16:01.108]  So it's either the little kids that are smarter than the guys, or the women.
[02:16:01.108 --> 02:16:04.332]  So the whole country's become feminized.
[02:16:04.332 --> 02:16:06.775]  Look at Congress!
[02:16:06.775 --> 02:16:09.238]  Look at these guys!
[02:16:09.238 --> 02:16:11.180]  Every one of them!
[02:16:11.180 --> 02:16:12.041]  The only one, again,
[02:16:12.401 --> 02:16:15.022]  I have any respect for his Ron Paul.
[02:16:15.022 --> 02:16:25.504]  I've said this, I don't agree with him on some of his libertarian issues, particularly on the environment and other... But overall, that's who I would cast my vote for.
[02:16:25.504 --> 02:16:29.325]  At least he speaks his mind and has a spine.
[02:16:29.325 --> 02:16:36.327]  The other ones go with the wind, or else they help the special interests that give them the most.
[02:16:36.327 --> 02:16:39.528]  So the nation is in this state, so when you ask me,
[02:16:40.228 --> 02:16:42.050]  Will people wake up?
[02:16:42.050 --> 02:16:44.772]  No, not until they grow up.
[02:16:44.772 --> 02:16:45.392]  Absolutely.
[02:16:45.392 --> 02:16:47.554]  Let's take a few calls here.
[02:16:47.554 --> 02:16:51.577]  Let's talk to Ari in California.
[02:16:51.577 --> 02:16:52.658]  You're on the air, Ari.
[02:16:52.658 --> 02:16:54.700]  Thanks for holding.
[02:16:54.700 --> 02:16:55.941]  Hey, hi, Alex.
[02:16:55.941 --> 02:16:57.142]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:16:57.142 --> 02:16:57.522]  Welcome.
[02:16:57.522 --> 02:16:59.504]  What's on your mind?
[02:16:59.504 --> 02:17:08.992]  I am going to go off topic here a little bit, but you mentioned something at the beginning of your show today, and I've heard you say that a few times before.
[02:17:09.967 --> 02:17:13.070]  And it was about Serbia and NATO.
[02:17:13.070 --> 02:17:13.691]  Yes.
[02:17:13.691 --> 02:17:22.238]  Now, as somebody who lived through Kosovo War, I have no doubt NATO probably had their own interest to go there.
[02:17:22.238 --> 02:17:31.087]  But to portray Serbia as some victim, like you often do, I just don't understand from somebody who's as informed as you are.
[02:17:31.843 --> 02:17:38.566]  No, no, I'm not saying that Tito before was some great guy, and I understand that both sides, everybody was killing each other.
[02:17:38.566 --> 02:17:45.289]  I'm not, I mean, I don't have any Serbian background, so I don't have a dog in the hunt here.
[02:17:45.289 --> 02:17:50.991]  What I was saying was, is just like Libya, they're going in, creating a civil war.
[02:17:50.991 --> 02:17:55.013]  They did fund Muslim groups out of Albania to attack the Serbs.
[02:17:55.013 --> 02:17:59.815]  I'm talking about that end of the war, when NATO then came in and used depleted uranium.
[02:18:00.835 --> 02:18:02.858]  And what came out of that?
[02:18:02.858 --> 02:18:04.820]  Do you have any comments on this, Gerald?
[02:18:04.820 --> 02:18:05.641]  Yes, I do.
[02:18:05.641 --> 02:18:20.900]  In one of my books with Zizi Gave Honey Boy, I wrote about how USA Today came out in an article years later saying how the United States, and they did it on July 4th weekend when nobody was reading the newspapers,
[02:18:21.420 --> 02:18:27.121]  About how they trumped up the atrocities and it wasn't as bad as the United States said.
[02:18:27.121 --> 02:18:32.142]  And the bottom line, of course, to all of this is, it's none of our business!
[02:18:32.142 --> 02:18:34.603]  How about straightening out Detroit?
[02:18:34.603 --> 02:18:35.943]  Cleaning up East St.
[02:18:35.943 --> 02:18:37.063]  Louis or St.
[02:18:37.063 --> 02:18:37.883]  Louis?
[02:18:37.883 --> 02:18:45.465]  So it's this whole idea of the United States spreading democracy when we're taking it away from us
[02:18:45.965 --> 02:18:47.927]  Over in our country over here.
[02:18:47.927 --> 02:18:58.834]  That's my point is that they were knocking out the strongest country in the middle of all that and they were using Al-Qaeda just as they're using Al-Qaeda in Libya and ma'am I appreciate your call.
[02:18:58.834 --> 02:19:02.097]  In fact maybe you should send me an email with your perspective perhaps I read it on air.
[02:19:02.637 --> 02:19:14.541]  I want to pick up on that as well, because Serbia, the former Yugoslavia, was the only country that was not buying in to that whole capitalist wave.
[02:19:14.541 --> 02:19:16.301]  That was another issue.
[02:19:16.301 --> 02:19:23.803]  Because if you remember during the communist days, Yugoslavia was doing better than just about anybody.
[02:19:23.803 --> 02:19:25.764]  They were trying to export that Yugo.
[02:19:25.764 --> 02:19:29.345]  It wasn't much of an automobile, but they were way ahead.
[02:19:29.345 --> 02:19:32.026]  They were making some of the premier locomotives.
[02:19:32.506 --> 02:19:35.427]  It's the same thing in Libya.
[02:19:35.427 --> 02:19:37.087]  Same reason they've taken over Libya.
[02:19:37.087 --> 02:19:38.788]  Gerald, we are out of time.

[02:21:05.063 --> 02:21:06.564]  Everyone can feel it.
[02:21:06.564 --> 02:21:15.449]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[02:21:15.449 --> 02:21:18.891]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising.
[02:21:18.891 --> 02:21:19.931]  But take heart.
[02:21:19.931 --> 02:21:23.733]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[02:21:23.733 --> 02:21:28.716]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war.
[02:21:29.136 --> 02:21:32.979]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[02:21:32.979 --> 02:21:34.700]  The globalists are scared.
[02:21:34.700 --> 02:21:36.041]  They've overreached.
[02:21:36.041 --> 02:21:39.543]  The future of the info war is in your hands.

[02:23:26.073 --> 02:23:28.215]  Well, certainly the forgotten survival food.
[02:23:28.215 --> 02:23:29.236]  Absolutely, Bill.

[02:24:09.500 --> 02:24:12.644]  Webster Tarpley was recently in Libya is coming up.
[02:24:12.644 --> 02:24:20.754]  I wanted Paul Watson to join us via video Skype just briefly to give us a breakdown of an article I worked on with him this morning.
[02:24:20.754 --> 02:24:21.174]  Obama
[02:24:22.228 --> 02:24:25.131]  It's struggling Americans with energy rate hikes.
[02:24:25.131 --> 02:24:28.174]  This is a big deal dealing with Agenda 21.
[02:24:28.174 --> 02:24:32.057]  And then segue into Libya.
[02:24:32.057 --> 02:24:35.881]  Another article he did, NATO hands terrorist who killed U.S.
[02:24:35.881 --> 02:24:38.703]  troops control of Libya.
[02:24:38.703 --> 02:24:43.268]  Al Qaeda gets new home as rebels seize Tripoli.
[02:24:43.268 --> 02:24:45.490]  I mean, now that they've pretty much taken over and
[02:24:46.450 --> 02:24:48.212]  Qaddafi scurrying around somewhere.
[02:24:48.212 --> 02:24:52.235]  Now it's just going to be an endless civil war, which is exactly what they want.
[02:24:52.235 --> 02:24:54.656]  Paul Watson.
[02:24:54.656 --> 02:24:55.657]  Well, that's right, Alex.
[02:24:55.657 --> 02:25:04.604]  And I mean, back on July 8th, I wrote an article and also I was on your show when Mike Adams was hosting it.
[02:25:04.604 --> 02:25:09.287]  And the headline of the article was US wants Qaddafi toppled by September.
[02:25:09.287 --> 02:25:14.891]  The United States and France have set a deadline September 2nd to topple Libyan leader Colonel Qaddafi.
[02:25:15.692 --> 02:25:31.051]  And basically at that time they were saying to him, look if you don't step down now we're going to launch a massive bombardment of NATO and we're going to basically bomb you out of there and that's exactly what happened on Saturday and Sunday you had NATO jets, RAF fighters,
[02:25:31.992 --> 02:25:44.126]  Uh, bombarded Tripoli, uh, and then the Al Qaeda rebels can now storm in and, uh, steal the 144 tons of gold and take over the country and basically turn it into an extremist backwater.
[02:25:44.126 --> 02:25:47.810]  Uh, Libya, of course, because Gaddafi had spent
[02:25:48.371 --> 02:25:51.794]  Most of the oil money, he reinvested it in the country.
[02:25:51.794 --> 02:25:55.757]  They had one of the highest living standards in the region.
[02:25:55.757 --> 02:25:58.039]  Now that's all going to be eviscerated.
[02:25:58.039 --> 02:26:12.471]  And I mean, that's why the middle class supported Gaddafi in the first place, because relatively in comparison to other countries in North Africa and the Middle East, it's a good standard of living for those people in Libya, in Tripoli, in the major cities.
[02:26:12.471 --> 02:26:14.092]  So now that's all eviscerated.
[02:26:15.117 --> 02:26:24.007]  You've got Obama and Cameron, you know, grandstanding at the glorious victory as if they commanded the army themselves.
[02:26:24.007 --> 02:26:29.614]  And basically it's going to turn into another Quagmire once those extremists get control.
[02:26:29.614 --> 02:26:31.076]  It's going to turn into another Iraq.
[02:26:31.656 --> 02:26:49.964]  And of course the irony is that the very terrorists who killed US troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, the same Al-Qaeda that was funded by MI5 in 1996 to assassinate Gaddafi, is now going to be firmly in control with globalist blessings in Libya.
[02:26:49.964 --> 02:26:54.866]  Well, again, you're anti-America, anti-England, that you don't support Al-Qaeda.
[02:26:54.866 --> 02:26:57.908]  Would you like to apologize for not supporting the glorious Al-Qaeda?
[02:26:59.694 --> 02:27:10.786]  I'm just still surprised that those people that rioted and looted in the UK a couple of weeks ago aren't the legitimate government, because I thought that's how we do business now.
[02:27:10.786 --> 02:27:15.792]  I mean, they were called protesters, remember back in March, even as they seized
[02:27:16.252 --> 02:27:40.913]  military tanks and fighter jets the media called them protesters for three weeks just to give the UN time enough to craft this resolution which they instantly violated the no-fly zone turned into a bombardment overnight and then arming, training, funding the rebels again violating their own resolution and now we come to this Operation Mermaid Dawn endgame and of course
[02:27:41.593 --> 02:27:47.957]  The establishment media's all joyous at these celebrations as if it's some organic uprising.
[02:27:47.957 --> 02:27:52.020]  There was a massive sustained bombardment on Saturday and Sunday night.
[02:27:52.020 --> 02:27:56.803]  Some, you know, 1,300 people dead, 5,000 injured.
[02:27:56.803 --> 02:28:00.346]  And the media's treating it as if it's just some organic uprising.
[02:28:00.346 --> 02:28:00.886]  No way!
[02:28:00.886 --> 02:28:04.469]  Now those planes, bombs they were dropping, killing people, that was peace.
[02:28:05.643 --> 02:28:12.812]  Peace bombs from the peace laureate Barack Obama who has more troops deployed than George W. Bush did at any time in his presidency.
[02:28:12.812 --> 02:28:14.274]  But what's wrong with you, Paul?
[02:28:14.274 --> 02:28:18.340]  I mean, working with Al Qaeda and bombing and killing civilians is peace.
[02:28:20.146 --> 02:28:22.667]  It's kinetic action, exactly.
[02:28:22.667 --> 02:28:24.727]  Well, you're very evil.
[02:28:24.727 --> 02:28:28.688]  I mean, look, it's totally going to disintegrate into bedlam, which is order out of chaos.
[02:28:28.688 --> 02:28:29.848]  That's what they want.
[02:28:29.848 --> 02:28:32.768]  So now the rest of Africa will sink deeper into the murk.
[02:28:32.768 --> 02:28:38.409]  What about the fact that the White House responded to us in February, and now it's totally confirmed.
[02:28:38.409 --> 02:28:43.570]  They're saying they're going to shut down most of the power plants not owned by General Electric, who's been given the waivers.
[02:28:43.570 --> 02:28:45.971]  This article we've got out today is so important, Paul.
[02:28:47.637 --> 02:28:58.741]  It's important because it's not just the fact that they're hitting Americans with massive power bill rises, you know, right on the edge of a double-dip recession, which is exactly what's happening in the UK.
[02:28:58.741 --> 02:29:02.402]  Double percentage point increases on your gas and electricity bills.
[02:29:02.402 --> 02:29:02.663]  That's right.
[02:29:02.663 --> 02:29:03.903]  They've made the same announcements.
[02:29:03.903 --> 02:29:06.184]  Your carbon taxes are set to double your prices.
[02:29:07.503 --> 02:29:23.954]  Yeah, and it's not just hollowing out the American industry, it's cap-and-trade via the back door, because remember Obama tried to get it passed in Congress, he failed, and now he's going to these power companies through the EPA and saying you have to get these controls in place.
[02:29:23.954 --> 02:29:30.098]  They can't do it, so they're just having to purchase carbon credits from the other power companies.
[02:29:30.098 --> 02:29:37.423]  The pollution is still going out there, but Al Gore, Obama, and the Rothschilds are still getting their carbon payments, so everything's okay.
[02:29:38.224 --> 02:29:39.325]  Well, that's good.
[02:29:39.325 --> 02:29:41.027]  Al-Qaeda isn't victorious.
[02:29:41.027 --> 02:29:43.009]  That's pro-America.
[02:29:43.009 --> 02:29:45.071]  Only the insiders get to have power plants.
[02:29:45.071 --> 02:29:45.891]  Prices are going up.
[02:29:45.891 --> 02:29:47.733]  That's good.
[02:29:47.733 --> 02:29:51.477]  And so it's wonderful.
[02:29:51.477 --> 02:29:52.878]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.878 --> 02:29:55.401]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.401 --> 02:29:58.104]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.409 --> 02:30:07.112]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[02:30:07.112 --> 02:30:13.556]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[02:30:13.556 --> 02:30:15.818]  Number one, study the past.
[02:30:15.818 --> 02:30:18.219]  History really does repeat itself.
[02:30:18.219 --> 02:30:21.942]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[02:30:23.058 --> 02:30:26.161]  Number three, take decisive action.
[02:30:26.161 --> 02:30:29.985]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[02:30:29.985 --> 02:30:35.050]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[02:30:35.050 --> 02:30:38.474]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[02:30:39.034 --> 02:30:42.456]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[02:30:42.456 --> 02:30:46.939]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:30:46.939 --> 02:30:51.883]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[02:30:51.883 --> 02:30:56.506]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:30:56.506 --> 02:30:58.667]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:31:01.564 --> 02:31:17.032]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[02:31:17.032 --> 02:31:20.714]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:21.724 --> 02:31:34.495]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:31:34.495 --> 02:31:41.760]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[02:31:42.441 --> 02:31:52.830]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[02:31:52.830 --> 02:31:56.753]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[02:31:56.753 --> 02:31:59.856]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[02:32:01.687 --> 02:32:03.388]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:32:03.388 --> 02:32:08.692]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:32:08.692 --> 02:32:10.233]  Saving means to make money.
[02:32:10.233 --> 02:32:19.020]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:32:19.760 --> 02:32:27.306]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:32:27.306 --> 02:32:35.313]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:32:35.313 --> 02:32:42.699]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you had to do something you've never done before, getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[02:32:45.461 --> 02:32:48.682]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[02:32:48.682 --> 02:32:50.923]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091.
[02:32:50.923 --> 02:32:53.164]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[02:33:14.400 --> 02:33:19.205]  We're going to be talking with Webster Griffin Tarpley who was recently in Tripoli under the bombardment.
[02:33:19.205 --> 02:33:22.548]  Reporting for InfoWars.com in a moment.
[02:33:22.548 --> 02:33:31.217]  Some of his colleagues that he knows have been wounded in the humanitarian bloodbath that is known as Nobel Peace.
[02:33:31.217 --> 02:33:32.339]  We're going to be looking at that.
[02:33:33.661 --> 02:33:39.103]  And reports of a Qaddafi counter-attack, fake dead Qaddafi photos drifting around.
[02:33:39.103 --> 02:33:45.306]  This is quite the spectacle and the new model of how the UN will invade you.
[02:33:45.306 --> 02:33:47.767]  They will fund terrorists to attack.
[02:33:47.767 --> 02:33:49.148]  They will uprise.
[02:33:49.148 --> 02:33:55.971]  If you fight back in any way, you will be bombarded with kinetic love bombs.
[02:33:55.971 --> 02:33:58.112]  And if you're not for al-Qaeda, you're an American.
[02:33:58.112 --> 02:34:01.033]  Now I guess I'm an American then.
[02:34:01.954 --> 02:34:08.720]  Because it's admitted, and we have the quotes here, of the rebel leaders, that they've killed Americans in Iraq and that they still hate America.
[02:34:08.720 --> 02:34:12.403]  Well then why would our government be doing this?
[02:34:12.403 --> 02:34:15.405]  Because they don't like stable countries.
[02:34:15.405 --> 02:34:18.428]  They want to destabilize all of Africa even further.
[02:34:18.428 --> 02:34:20.309]  So that's coming up with Webster Tarpley.
[02:34:20.309 --> 02:34:26.975]  Watson, finishing up with your Central article, I've seen the articles in England in the London Telegraph just a few weeks ago.
[02:34:26.975 --> 02:34:29.837]  Power prices set to double in the next three years.
[02:34:30.778 --> 02:34:36.419]  And so they can't get the carbon tax that's paid to the Rothschild slash Rockefeller, Al Gore.
[02:34:36.419 --> 02:34:38.039]  I mean, they openly own it.
[02:34:38.039 --> 02:34:39.000]  Carbon exchanges.
[02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:41.220]  You go to them and pay them money.
[02:34:41.220 --> 02:34:42.180]  I'm burning coal.
[02:34:42.180 --> 02:34:43.400]  I'll pay you money, Al Gore.
[02:34:43.400 --> 02:34:45.501]  And he goes, good, my son.
[02:34:45.501 --> 02:34:47.941]  Your family is taken out of purgatory.
[02:34:47.941 --> 02:34:49.241]  I absolve you.
[02:34:49.241 --> 02:34:54.362]  Pay more money and we will get you, the rest of your family, out of hell itself.
[02:34:54.362 --> 02:34:55.643]  Oh, thank you, Al Gore.
[02:34:55.643 --> 02:34:56.743]  Oh, great man, Bear Pig.
[02:34:57.643 --> 02:35:08.846]  But now, they've already had rolling blackouts, massive power increase cost, and now, in your article, you've got all these major power companies that aren't part of the insider group.
[02:35:08.846 --> 02:35:16.868]  You've got the Texas Power Commission, the Texas Public Utility Commission saying, get ready for huge blackouts and double the power prices.
[02:35:16.868 --> 02:35:22.990]  The Fort Worth Star-Telegram is reporting that, and this will be more of a blessing with General Electric.
[02:35:23.570 --> 02:35:37.119]  Who's had a waiver since February, running around giggling and laughing in front of everyone, obviously increasing power output at their factories, at their generating systems.
[02:35:37.119 --> 02:35:39.400]  I mean, this is totally mafia.
[02:35:39.400 --> 02:35:43.823]  This is like saying you can only buy groceries from, you know, Obama's.
[02:35:43.823 --> 02:35:46.985]  Maybe they'll start a string of grocery stores.
[02:35:46.985 --> 02:35:50.067]  I guess they kind of have done that with Nafta and Gat with Walmart.
[02:35:50.067 --> 02:35:51.848]  So finishing up, Paul Watson from England.
[02:35:53.612 --> 02:35:54.633]  Well, precisely.
[02:35:54.633 --> 02:35:58.416]  I mean, GE gives Obama half a million dollars, they get the waiver.
[02:35:58.416 --> 02:35:59.317]  That's how it works.
[02:35:59.317 --> 02:36:01.358]  That's Chicago land for you.
[02:36:01.358 --> 02:36:06.863]  But this is tens of millions of profit, conservatively, over the next few years for a half mil?
[02:36:08.646 --> 02:36:09.427]  Well, precisely.
[02:36:09.427 --> 02:36:16.551]  I mean, it's over a hundred billion dollars just in the immediate costs that these power companies will have to pay.
[02:36:16.551 --> 02:36:25.838]  And as I said before, even if you believe that carbon dioxide and these other greenhouse gases that they're talking about are, you know, deadly killers, they're gonna be emitted anyway.
[02:36:26.098 --> 02:36:37.086]  It's just the power companies are going to buy the carbon credits from Al Gore, the Rothschilds, and Obama, who is also invested in it, and they're going to pass the cost on to the consumers.
[02:36:37.086 --> 02:36:39.408]  That's why our bills are going up 20%.
[02:36:39.408 --> 02:36:46.374]  But the Rothschilds have yachts and private jets that put out a special gas that counteracts the devil carbon dioxide.
[02:36:46.374 --> 02:36:47.875]  So you want to pray to them.
[02:36:47.875 --> 02:36:51.978]  Did you know that the Rothschild flatulence is actually the only gas humans live off of?
[02:36:53.424 --> 02:37:01.446]  Well precisely, and you know, Ted Turner can have five kids, Rockefeller can have six kids, but overpopulation's a problem, we can't have any.
[02:37:01.446 --> 02:37:07.687]  The thing is though, I mean look at this, UK faces green agenda backlash as energy prices rise.
[02:37:07.687 --> 02:37:18.289]  For the moment they're going up 20%, they'll go up more next year, but that's also the amount that they spend on so-called green energy, and this is the same in both countries, and it mainly goes on
[02:37:18.829 --> 02:37:29.617]  Wind turbines, which are notoriously inefficient, in Northern Europe, when we get cold weather, like we did last winter, you know, coldest winter in a hundred years, they don't work!
[02:37:29.617 --> 02:37:46.250]  You have to get really powerful winds for them to work, and even then, they're so much more expensive to run, they always break, you know, birds are flying into them, you can't maintain them, because they're out in these isolated locations, and all our money's being spent on this, because they've got this commitment to generate 20% green energy.
[02:37:48.291 --> 02:38:01.280]  I think it's totally reasonable that insiders get waivers for not having to buy health care on Obamacare and that General Electric gets a waiver that they wrote.
[02:38:01.280 --> 02:38:03.121]  I mean, they wrote it to shut down their competition.
[02:38:03.121 --> 02:38:04.342]  I think that's fine.
[02:38:04.342 --> 02:38:07.063]  And I think Al Qaeda taking over Libya is a wonderful thing.
[02:38:07.063 --> 02:38:10.806]  And I just again, I'm really ashamed that you're not for Al Qaeda, Paul.
[02:38:12.298 --> 02:38:22.122]  Well, I guess that, you know, as long as we do pay our carbon credits, at least the space aliens won't attack, because that's what the NASA scientists told us last week.
[02:38:22.122 --> 02:38:25.283]  Space aliens are concerned about global warming.
[02:38:25.283 --> 02:38:30.105]  If we don't line the pockets of Al Gore, the first carbon billionaire, you know, E.T.
[02:38:30.105 --> 02:38:31.245]  might come and get us, so...
[02:38:31.485 --> 02:38:35.668]  By the way, Jaren actually, when I talked about this yesterday, did post the Guardian article.
[02:38:35.668 --> 02:38:44.273]  A NASA-funded scientist, and this is the London Guardian headline, came out and said, pay Al Gore the money or the aliens are going to kill us.
[02:38:44.273 --> 02:38:49.796]  I mean, Paul, next they're going to say Freddy Krueger's coming if you don't pay ManBearPig.
[02:38:49.796 --> 02:38:52.818]  And of course I joked about the flatulence of the Rothschilds.
[02:38:52.818 --> 02:38:55.260]  They are now in Europe, and it's starting in the U.S.
[02:38:55.260 --> 02:38:58.262]  Canada already passed it, the cow flatulence tax.
[02:38:59.182 --> 02:39:09.427]  And so they're saying that cows' flatulence is going to kill the earth, even though the earth's always been covered with herbivores, bovine creatures.
[02:39:09.427 --> 02:39:16.250]  I mean, they wiped out the tens of millions of buffalo and replaced it with an animal that can breed with it.
[02:39:17.250 --> 02:39:19.452]  Another type of domesticated cow.
[02:39:19.452 --> 02:39:21.014]  I mean, it's insane.
[02:39:21.014 --> 02:39:26.640]  They say aliens are gonna get us, cow flatulence is evil, pay Rothschild more money.
[02:39:26.640 --> 02:39:30.223]  I mean, you could not make up a joke this disgusting and this sick.
[02:39:30.223 --> 02:39:34.728]  They're paying a sheep flatulence tax in Australia now.
[02:39:35.328 --> 02:39:39.572]  And they're openly, the New York Times had the headline three years ago, a tax on breathing.
[02:39:39.572 --> 02:39:41.793]  They're not playing games.
[02:39:41.793 --> 02:39:49.440]  And there's all these weird goody two-shoes running around who like get off on hating themselves and they want to pay a tax for breathing.
[02:39:49.440 --> 02:39:50.781]  These are mentally ill people, Paul.
[02:39:51.883 --> 02:39:54.544]  Oh yeah, save the planet, kill yourself.
[02:39:54.544 --> 02:39:56.265]  But these people are in power.
[02:39:56.265 --> 02:39:58.986]  John Holdren's in control of the geoengineering.
[02:39:58.986 --> 02:40:15.594]  And then you've got this planned-opolis agenda, which is what the big oil companies and the British government put out a couple of years ago, where they say, if you want to drive a car, you're going to have to apply for permission from the government, we're going to have a global food council, you're going to get meat as a rare delicacy, maybe once a month.
[02:40:15.834 --> 02:40:23.502]  Incidentally, they've got trendies posing as patriots, liberal filmmakers making movies about the same plastic cities we're all going to have to go live in.
[02:40:24.807 --> 02:40:28.109]  Yeah, and it's a throwback to Maoist China.
[02:40:28.109 --> 02:40:35.693]  Even as recently as the 80s, people who lived in China, poor people, meat was a rare delicacy, once a month treat.
[02:40:35.693 --> 02:40:45.378]  And in this planned-opolis, slave-opolis, the people who resist are going to be thrown in these cry-freedom ghettos where they're segregated off from the rest of society.
[02:40:46.178 --> 02:40:51.464]  That's not my terminology, that's what they call them in their own video promoting this agenda.
[02:40:51.464 --> 02:40:59.593]  So people need to realize that these people are in control, they're insane, and they're holding the reins of power.
[02:40:59.593 --> 02:41:00.875]  They're insane like a fox!
[02:41:01.015 --> 02:41:11.379]  Their low-level minions are mentally ill and just like a moth to flame, enjoy the control freak authoritarianism and believe that they're going to be part of it because they've given themselves to it.
[02:41:11.379 --> 02:41:13.399]  That's your average general loser.
[02:41:13.399 --> 02:41:15.260]  But on top, they're cold-blooded.
[02:41:15.260 --> 02:41:17.981]  They say, how do we sell slavery and make folks love it?
[02:41:17.981 --> 02:41:24.543]  We teach people how to help themselves and then have a new green Nazism sold while they fly around on their private jets.
[02:41:24.543 --> 02:41:27.504]  Paul Watson will continue to track these articles as they unfold.
[02:41:27.504 --> 02:41:29.725]  The White House responded to us in February.
[02:41:30.405 --> 02:41:32.126]  Everybody needs to get this article out.
[02:41:32.126 --> 02:41:35.889]  Obama hits struggling Americans with energy rate hikes.
[02:41:35.889 --> 02:41:37.830]  Thank you so much, Paul Watson.
[02:41:37.830 --> 02:41:39.071]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:41:39.071 --> 02:41:52.941]  All right, Webster Griffin Tarbly, who bravely spent several weeks in Libya a little over a month ago and reported to us live under the peaceful kinetic military bombardment that's killed thousands and thousands of people, but I'm politically correct.
[02:41:52.941 --> 02:41:55.983]  It is peaceful and non-military because they said so.
[02:41:56.583 --> 02:41:59.304]  Uh, now it's confirmed Al-Qaeda are the leaders.
[02:41:59.304 --> 02:42:03.646]  Headline, NATO hands terrorists who killed US troops control over Libya.
[02:42:03.646 --> 02:42:07.187]  Al-Qaeda gets new home as rebels seize Tripoli.
[02:42:07.187 --> 02:42:08.708]  Uh, what is the stratagem here?
[02:42:08.708 --> 02:42:11.709]  What's the latest that Webster Griffin Tarpley has?
[02:42:11.709 --> 02:42:22.013]  Uh, he also reported to me that one of his colleagues, Dr. Franklin Lamb, shot in Tripoli by, uh, NATO Al-Qaeda, uh, peace activist.
[02:42:22.013 --> 02:42:22.133]  Um...
[02:42:23.160 --> 02:42:28.645]  Webster Tarbley, tell us more about the piece that's reportedly killed thousands in the last 24 hours.
[02:42:28.645 --> 02:42:35.632]  Well, what we're dealing with here is a carefully, cynically planned military operation by the NATO High Command with the U.S.
[02:42:35.632 --> 02:42:37.834]  playing a very, very important role in it.
[02:42:37.834 --> 02:42:40.036]  Don't listen to anything to the contrary.
[02:42:40.036 --> 02:42:48.564]  It is called Operation Mermaid Dawn, and in the middle of that you've also got something called Operation Mermaid or Operation Siren.
[02:42:49.304 --> 02:42:56.469]  Similar terms coming maybe from the French, but this is a military operation and it's basically this.
[02:42:56.469 --> 02:43:03.533]  They're facing the mid-September deadline when the United Nations Security Council resolution runs out.
[02:43:03.533 --> 02:43:10.138]  And without that resolution, it's very hard for Italy and Canada and a bunch of smaller NATO countries
[02:43:10.698 --> 02:43:12.359]  Thought crime, love bombing!
[02:43:30.325 --> 02:43:30.765]  Yeah, right.
[02:43:30.765 --> 02:43:31.945]  Carpet bombing.
[02:43:31.945 --> 02:43:33.426]  Carpet bombing of civilians.
[02:43:33.426 --> 02:43:35.306]  No concern for civilian casualties.
[02:43:35.306 --> 02:43:38.026]  Just a mad dash to get it all over with.
[02:43:38.026 --> 02:43:45.908]  So, a very, very heavy bombing of Tripoli and of the approaches to Tripoli in the past week or so.
[02:43:45.908 --> 02:43:56.030]  And in addition, a very aggressive use of these Apache helicopters with a lot of strafing of civilians with machine guns, especially, and some rockets.
[02:43:56.030 --> 02:43:57.470]  And this has accounted for
[02:43:58.230 --> 02:44:04.534]  Something upwards of 1,300 dead civilians in the past 48 hours, let's say.
[02:44:04.534 --> 02:44:09.317]  1,300 dead as of yesterday and then many more overnight.
[02:44:09.317 --> 02:44:14.419]  So this is the protection of civilians under the UN Security Council resolution.
[02:44:14.419 --> 02:44:20.343]  So, carpet bombing Apache helicopters, that accounts for the rapid progress of the rebels.
[02:44:20.343 --> 02:44:23.765]  Now the other thing that accounts for it is amphibious landings.
[02:44:24.325 --> 02:44:48.245]  All reports now agree that smaller landing craft as well as larger NATO warships cruised up very close to the coast there, to the port of Tripoli on the Mediterranean, and landed these death squads, these terror teams of Al-Qaeda killers who had been shipped in from Benghazi and Tobruk and Derna and places like this.
[02:44:49.646 --> 02:44:55.473]  Look, we're pro-America here on this show, so don't criticize the Valiant Al-Qaeda forces.
[02:44:56.830 --> 02:45:01.534]  By the way, they're banning first responders from the 9-11 remembrance event.
[02:45:01.534 --> 02:45:03.996]  So the 9-11 responders are bad, Al-Qaeda's good.
[02:45:03.996 --> 02:45:09.060]  I'm going to have to have you apologize for talking bad about Al-Qaeda, or we're going to have to let you go.
[02:45:09.060 --> 02:45:13.004]  Okay, so this I think accounts for this.
[02:45:13.004 --> 02:45:15.726]  It's what you call in warfare a coup d'etat.
[02:45:15.726 --> 02:45:19.369]  In other words, they've taken some key parts of the city.
[02:45:19.369 --> 02:45:25.594]  However, the reports I'm getting, and these come from Franklin Lamb that you mentioned, wounded though he is, he continues to report.
[02:45:26.054 --> 02:45:32.040]  Lizzie Phelan, who has been in the Rixos Hotel, and Darius Mahdi Nazem Rowiah.
[02:45:32.040 --> 02:45:35.003]  You can see a lot of this on Russia Today.
[02:45:35.003 --> 02:45:45.574]  They continued to report during the night, and especially Franklin Lamb is up in a high-rise hotel, and he can see the approaches coming into Tripoli from the West.
[02:45:47.977 --> 02:45:57.968]  What we've got is reports of a counter-attack being organized by the Qaddafi forces, starting from the Qaddafi compound, with heavy fighting going on there.
[02:45:57.968 --> 02:46:03.494]  Tanks under Qaddafi and his supporters moving towards Green Square.
[02:46:03.494 --> 02:46:08.460]  We're even told that the rebels have lost control, at least temporarily,
[02:46:09.040 --> 02:46:15.402]  Did lose control of Green Square when a column of Qaddafi forces went through there.
[02:46:15.402 --> 02:46:19.403]  The counterattack seems to be under the command of Thomas Qaddafi.
[02:46:19.403 --> 02:46:21.163]  K-H-A-M-I-S.
[02:46:21.163 --> 02:46:24.384]  That's the one son who has not been captured.
[02:46:24.384 --> 02:46:26.305]  Three other sons captured.
[02:46:26.305 --> 02:46:29.306]  One son killed months ago.
[02:46:29.306 --> 02:46:34.267]  The other thing we have is from Franklin Lamb and his vantage point in this high-rise hotel.
[02:46:35.027 --> 02:46:44.175]  He says that he saw a convoy of 25 pro-Qadhafi military trucks going towards the center of the city.
[02:46:44.175 --> 02:46:48.298]  So, this I don't think is over.
[02:46:48.298 --> 02:46:51.320]  And there's some indications that there was actually a strategy.
[02:46:51.320 --> 02:46:56.725]  I would say the Qadhafi forces were taken by surprise by the amphibious landings.
[02:46:56.725 --> 02:47:01.749]  This maybe accounts for why they didn't use their anti-ship missiles, which they are known to have.
[02:47:01.909 --> 02:47:09.433]  By the way, my sources say U.S., NATO, and private contractors were inserted two days ago from the sea.
[02:47:09.433 --> 02:47:12.635]  It's probably not just the Valiant Al-Qaeda people.
[02:47:12.635 --> 02:47:23.881]  Yes, well, the report that I have, if you look at Topley.net, I've got the report from Maison that the Al-Qaeda fighters from Benghazi that were landed by NATO
[02:47:24.281 --> 02:47:35.592]  We're under the control of NATO officers, so European officers, which reproduces the eternal pattern of the colonial army, just what the Libyans had thought that they'd gotten rid of.
[02:47:35.592 --> 02:47:38.735]  So, heavy fighting, I think, goes on.
[02:47:38.735 --> 02:47:40.657]  There is a humanitarian emergency.
[02:47:40.657 --> 02:47:45.442]  In particular, I would mention that the people in this Rixos Hotel, the international
[02:47:46.262 --> 02:47:50.085]  These are international reporters who are basically anti-NATO.
[02:47:50.085 --> 02:47:52.066]  They don't agree with the CIA line.
[02:47:52.066 --> 02:47:56.829]  And that would be Maktidarios Nazimrowaya, that you can see on Russia Today.
[02:47:56.829 --> 02:48:02.032]  Franklin Lamb is in a different hotel, and Thierry Meisson is also still in the city.
[02:48:02.032 --> 02:48:07.296]  I would also point out, there seems to be danger to the life of Musa Ibrahim, who is
[02:48:07.756 --> 02:48:09.437]  Well, that's peace too, though.
[02:48:09.437 --> 02:48:12.298]  Killing women and children, that's what the good guys do.
[02:48:12.298 --> 02:48:15.019]  You're not going to criticize torture on this show, are you?
[02:48:25.042 --> 02:48:34.828]  I think we can simply, you know, if you want to start, take a case study of the human rights record of these Benghazi rebels, see what happens to Musa Ibrahim and his family.
[02:48:34.828 --> 02:48:37.789]  That will tell you everything.
[02:48:37.789 --> 02:48:50.997]  Now, in terms of what's going to happen now, Qaddafi, if Qaddafi can maintain some kind of a position in the capital or nearby, that's a very different scenario from what the television is telling you.
[02:48:51.517 --> 02:49:09.688]  If Qaddafi is decisively defeated in the Tripoli area, he would probably be well advised to take the example of Mubarak and go to some friendly place and perhaps lay low for a while and wait for the inevitable civil war among these thieves.
[02:49:09.688 --> 02:49:11.790]  Because these are thieves that are going to fall out.
[02:49:11.790 --> 02:49:16.312]  You can already see... Well, they've been constantly killing each other and calling in airstrikes on each other.
[02:49:16.312 --> 02:49:16.973]  That's admitted.
[02:49:17.233 --> 02:49:17.794]  Exactly.
[02:49:17.794 --> 02:49:20.017]  So that would be this Khalifa Hifter.
[02:49:20.017 --> 02:49:23.101]  The top CIA guy is Khalifa Hifter.
[02:49:23.101 --> 02:49:24.703]  But of course, he lived in Virginia.
[02:49:24.703 --> 02:49:28.629]  He lived here between the Pentagon and the CIA for 20 years.
[02:49:28.629 --> 02:49:33.335]  And there are going to be factional differences between him and, say, a bunch of guys like
[02:49:34.956 --> 02:49:38.358]  The ones who ruined Darna, who had been fighting the U.S.
[02:49:38.358 --> 02:49:39.718]  in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[02:49:39.718 --> 02:49:41.939]  I don't see how they're going to get along very well.
[02:49:41.939 --> 02:49:47.262]  You've also got Jalil, who is the presentable face, and Jibril.
[02:49:47.262 --> 02:49:50.543]  These people have really no mass support.
[02:49:50.543 --> 02:49:56.506]  They're there to have a presentable face that they can send to the United Nations and so forth.
[02:49:56.506 --> 02:50:01.048]  So I would expect a bloody civil war to break out among the rebel factions.
[02:50:01.828 --> 02:50:08.212]  Quite soon, and especially, we've got this 70-page report of what the occupation is going to look like.
[02:50:08.212 --> 02:50:15.736]  The occupation calls for tens of thousands of troops from the United Arab Emirates, Emiratis.
[02:50:15.736 --> 02:50:17.477]  Now, those guys are royalists.
[02:50:17.477 --> 02:50:25.902]  They're reactionaries in all of their social policies, whereas Gaddafi is one of the most progressive, socially-oriented people, right?
[02:50:25.902 --> 02:50:28.784]  All the oil money was used, or to a large extent, for
[02:50:29.524 --> 02:50:30.065]  We're good to go.
[02:51:01.606 --> 02:51:07.993]  What you're about to hear are the real experiences of women over 40 who finally lost weight by becoming hormonally balanced again.
[02:51:07.993 --> 02:51:08.653]  I lost 20 pounds.
[02:51:08.653 --> 02:51:09.454]  I lost 40 pounds.
[02:51:09.454 --> 02:51:10.916]  I lost 55 pounds.
[02:51:10.916 --> 02:51:12.658]  I went from a size 14 to a size 8.
[02:51:16.300 --> 02:51:23.186]  Their secret is Amberin, the revolutionary formula for women over 40 that balances hormones naturally.
[02:51:23.186 --> 02:51:26.849]  The leading cause of weight gain over 40 is hormonal imbalance.
[02:51:26.849 --> 02:51:30.932]  Until you balance your hormones, losing weight can be practically impossible.
[02:51:30.932 --> 02:51:37.857]  But Amberin restores hormonal balance naturally, so the weight can just fall right off, even that stubborn belly fat.
[02:51:37.857 --> 02:51:45.704]  Plus, Amberin eliminates other symptoms of hormonal aging, like hot flashes, night sweats, low libido, difficulty concentrating, and more.

[02:54:03.874 --> 02:54:06.556]  Webster Griffin Tarpley is our guest.
[02:54:06.556 --> 02:54:11.679]  I've seen three polls out this weekend where Ron Paul is number one.
[02:54:11.679 --> 02:54:20.045]  The Drudge Report at DrudgeReport.com, we're also posting this at InfoWars.com, has the headline that Ron Paul is evenly matched against Obama.
[02:54:20.045 --> 02:54:22.867]  He's neck and neck with Obama.
[02:54:22.867 --> 02:54:27.190]  There it is, Gallup, Obama closely matched against Paul and Bachman.
[02:54:27.190 --> 02:54:31.633]  So as I keep telling you, because I'm not just cheerleading here and saying Ron Paul can win.
[02:54:32.998 --> 02:54:37.603]  You know, three and a half years ago, I was just pointing out he's an underdog, but he should win.
[02:54:37.603 --> 02:54:42.949]  Now, if you look at all the hundreds of polls I've seen, different straw polls, he's number one, number two, or number three.
[02:54:44.059 --> 02:54:46.560]  Now, that is a front-runner.
[02:54:46.560 --> 02:54:50.100]  That's with them ignoring him or demonizing him.
[02:54:50.100 --> 02:54:53.501]  So, they're definitely scared of Ron Paul.
[02:54:53.501 --> 02:54:57.342]  Now, shifting gears back to Webster Griffin Tarpley of tarpley.net.
[02:54:57.342 --> 02:55:06.123]  Webster, any way you slice it, I'm not a fan of Gaddafi, but compared to Al-Qaeda, there is such a thing as lesser of two evils, and he wasn't a total pig.
[02:55:06.123 --> 02:55:13.145]  I mean, he did build up the country and the rest of Africa, and we know it means civil war, death, destruction of a
[02:55:14.045 --> 02:55:21.390]  Well, on the one hand, Gaddafi represents an ideological threat because of this Arab socialism which he actually practiced.
[02:55:36.254 --> 02:55:43.799]  Libya probably has the best record of any oil-producing country in terms of reinvesting that in social development.
[02:55:43.799 --> 02:55:49.564]  This was the top country on the United Nations Human Development Index for Africa.
[02:55:49.564 --> 02:56:00.071]  They were at 57 in the world, which meant that they were beating Russia, beating Ukraine, beating Brazil, and it's remarkable because they had started so near rock bottom.
[02:56:00.071 --> 02:56:00.952]  They were absolute
[02:56:01.513 --> 02:56:08.984]  Uh, basically nomads until about 1965, 1970 when Qaddafi came in.
[02:56:08.984 --> 02:56:16.756]  Remember, you've got that great man-made river, which means that they're going to have water for the next couple of hundred years, unless NATO has bombed it in the meantime.
[02:56:17.556 --> 02:56:21.677]  And that, you know, healthcare was for free, housing allowances were given.
[02:56:21.677 --> 02:56:23.218]  These are the things that NATO hates.
[02:56:23.218 --> 02:56:28.259]  So they want to go in there now and privatize all that.
[02:56:28.259 --> 02:56:37.822]  The weakening of Qaddafi is due to the fact that there was a first privatization offensive in 2003, when they demanded the partial privatization of a certain of the oil.
[02:56:37.822 --> 02:56:43.803]  And because he was under the gun of what Bush had just done in Iraq, he felt that he had to make concessions.
[02:56:43.803 --> 02:56:45.744]  And unfortunately that even reached up into his
[02:56:46.844 --> 02:56:57.326]  And now it's admitted that the 70 plus billion in banks is being stolen, the tens of billions in gold is now going to disappear, and stolen from the people of Libya.
[02:56:57.326 --> 02:56:59.767]  I mean, this is just so outrageous.
[02:56:59.767 --> 02:57:00.407]  Right.
[02:57:00.407 --> 02:57:05.328]  The frozen assets that the State Department has got custody of now, the U.S.
[02:57:05.328 --> 02:57:11.589]  part, I don't know how many billion there are, but there are quite a few billion, that's going to go into the Swiss bank accounts of these
[02:57:12.529 --> 02:57:13.710]  Well, that's my next issue.
[02:57:13.710 --> 02:57:17.173]  Are they going to use Libya as their new Al-Qaeda base to then menace the West?
[02:57:31.124 --> 02:57:34.886]  Yeah, you can imagine Al-Qaeda piracy in the Mediterranean.
[02:57:34.886 --> 02:57:36.307]  You know, it's funny.
[02:57:36.307 --> 02:57:43.692]  If you go back to American history, in the early 1800s, the big concern was the Barbary pirates, right?
[02:57:43.692 --> 02:57:45.393]  Stephen Decatur and all this.
[02:57:45.393 --> 02:57:51.377]  So it meant that these ports in North Africa were bases of pirates.
[02:57:51.897 --> 02:57:59.942]  Pirates of course worked with the British, because the British bought protection, others couldn't, the US couldn't and didn't, and therefore had to wage these wars.
[02:57:59.942 --> 02:58:08.246]  Today you've got the US intervening in a place like Libya to re-establish piracy, but this time under Al-Qaeda auspices.
[02:58:08.246 --> 02:58:16.031]  So this is going to have a big effect on the entire Mediterranean littoral, from Spain, to Italy, to Greece, all the way across.
[02:58:16.471 --> 02:58:21.454]  This is now going to fundamentally change what the Mediterranean looks like.
[02:58:21.454 --> 02:58:24.375]  And again, it's going to be an open sore.
[02:58:24.375 --> 02:58:32.160]  If you didn't want Al-Qaeda to have a sanctuary, if that was the point of Afghanistan, they have just been given a sanctuary, or at least it seems so.
[02:58:32.160 --> 02:58:33.560]  Alright, Lebster, stay there.
[02:58:33.560 --> 02:58:37.062]  Let's do five more minutes in PrisonPlanet.tv Overdrive.
[02:58:37.062 --> 02:58:38.923]  The official radio show is over.
[02:58:38.923 --> 02:58:40.144]  See you back tomorrow, 11am.
[02:58:40.144 --> 02:58:41.244]  Spread the word about the broadcast.
[02:58:41.244 --> 02:58:45.427]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:47.304 --> 02:58:51.409]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.409 --> 02:58:52.590]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:58:52.590 --> 02:58:59.497]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:58:59.497 --> 02:59:02.060]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:59:02.060 --> 02:59:07.246]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:59:07.426 --> 02:59:10.468]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:59:10.468 --> 02:59:12.789]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:59:12.789 --> 02:59:19.052]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:59:19.052 --> 02:59:22.414]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:59:22.414 --> 02:59:28.217]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:59:28.217 --> 02:59:29.858]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:59:29.858 --> 02:59:31.139]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:59:31.139 --> 02:59:33.660]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:59:33.820 --> 02:59:38.021]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:59:38.021 --> 02:59:42.663]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:59:42.663 --> 02:59:45.243]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[02:59:52.186 --> 02:59:58.988]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:12.563 --> 03:00:18.205]  Okay, folks, we're in a little overdrive here at PrisonPlanet.TV with Webster Tarpley.
[03:00:18.205 --> 03:00:30.650]  Webster was bringing up the fact that reporters are being shot, a lot of things are happening, and Russia Today has gone with a story that a CNN reporter threatened one of their reporters and said, you'll be lucky to basically get out of here alive.
[03:00:30.650 --> 03:00:32.530]  He interpreted that as a death threat.
[03:00:32.530 --> 03:00:33.571]  Webster, tell us about that.
[03:00:34.366 --> 03:00:45.611]  This is Mahdi Darius Nazem Roya, and he's a guy that Russia Today had been interviewing basically every hour during the night now, between Sunday and Monday.
[03:00:45.611 --> 03:00:54.514]  And some of these reports were very dramatic, because he'd be sitting there, and he said, the security has disappeared, and you could hear gunfire outside.
[03:00:54.514 --> 03:00:56.515]  There were snipers outside of the hotel.
[03:00:56.515 --> 03:01:01.557]  He tried to go out and put up placards saying, press, TV, don't shoot.
[03:01:02.137 --> 03:01:07.522]  And snipers were shooting at him as he was trying to put up these placards.
[03:01:07.522 --> 03:01:11.806]  And during the night, you could see him walking around the corridors of this hotel, very eerie.
[03:01:11.806 --> 03:01:16.471]  But he says, now this is Darius Makhty Nazim Relaya says on Russia Today,
[03:01:17.291 --> 03:01:30.089]  That the CNN correspondent, or one of them, came to him and conveyed what he interpreted as something threatening, which was, I'm surprised you're still putting out anti-NATO news.
[03:01:30.089 --> 03:01:31.791]  You know, that could be very dangerous.
[03:01:32.712 --> 03:01:35.515]  This, I think, can be interpreted quite easily.
[03:01:35.515 --> 03:01:42.881]  And, of course, this is in the context of Franklin Lamb having been shot at the pool of a different hotel.
[03:01:42.881 --> 03:01:45.042]  The first incident is at the Rixos.
[03:01:45.042 --> 03:01:48.785]  The second one is at a hotel, I call it the Radisson.
[03:01:48.785 --> 03:01:54.130]  It's a 26-story, but I think it used to be called the Carinthia, and that's what everybody calls it there.
[03:01:54.130 --> 03:01:56.352]  Anyway, he was walking by the pool.
[03:01:57.132 --> 03:02:06.374]  A funny story, he had a bicycle and he was out riding around Tripoli to see what the story was yesterday morning, Sunday morning.
[03:02:06.374 --> 03:02:10.835]  He did fine and he found no particular evidence of rebel forces.
[03:02:10.835 --> 03:02:21.657]  He gets back to the hotel, he puts the bicycle aside and he walks by the pool and he thinks he was shot by a sniper out of the abandoned Marriott Hotel nearby.
[03:02:22.937 --> 03:02:25.438]  Uh, that would seem to have been pretty much planned.
[03:02:25.438 --> 03:02:28.419]  I have to say, Franklin, when I was there, I saw him repeatedly.
[03:02:28.419 --> 03:02:31.920]  He would go to the pool, spend an hour there every day.
[03:02:31.920 --> 03:02:37.482]  And then you've got, uh, there's a written report from Thierry Meyssan of France.
[03:02:37.482 --> 03:02:45.864]  Franklin Lamb is from the U.S., Nazem Relaya from Canada, Meyssan from France, and he put out basically a summary of what had happened.
[03:02:45.864 --> 03:02:48.585]  By the way, he's a very well respected reporter in France.
[03:02:49.284 --> 03:02:52.566]  Yes, and he's somebody who has lived in the Middle East.
[03:02:52.566 --> 03:03:04.375]  I mean, he's felt obliged to live in the Middle East since Sarkozy has come in, because it was getting too dangerous to be in France, and that seems to be the trend.
[03:03:04.375 --> 03:03:07.897]  Anyway... Well, there's no doubt the tyrants have gone into overdrive.
[03:03:07.897 --> 03:03:09.799]  They're trying to bring down Syria right now, too.
[03:03:10.492 --> 03:03:14.814]  Yes, now I think this is going to be a totally different thing.
[03:03:14.814 --> 03:03:19.436]  The merit of Qaddafi, I think Qaddafi has many merits.
[03:03:19.436 --> 03:03:24.758]  There's no need to apologize for Qaddafi compared to most of the people in the U.S.
[03:03:24.758 --> 03:03:25.258]  Empire.
[03:03:25.258 --> 03:03:27.879]  This is clearly many cuts above.
[03:03:27.879 --> 03:03:34.262]  But the real merit of Qaddafi lately has been that he blocked this process of the color revolutions.
[03:03:34.262 --> 03:03:38.604]  Remember, they said, we got Ben Ali of Tunisia, we overthrew in
[03:03:39.644 --> 03:03:40.485]  In January.
[03:03:40.485 --> 03:03:43.387]  And then we overthrew Mubarak of Egypt in February.
[03:03:43.387 --> 03:03:46.189]  And they really thought they could overthrow Gaddafi in March.
[03:03:46.189 --> 03:03:49.131]  And now it's August and he is still fighting.
[03:03:49.131 --> 03:03:50.272]  He's still in the field.
[03:03:50.272 --> 03:03:52.934]  And who knows how long it will last.
[03:03:52.934 --> 03:03:54.255]  And what the outcome will be.
[03:03:54.255 --> 03:03:54.996]  I wouldn't want to guess.
[03:03:55.974 --> 03:03:58.535]  Libya has not been kind to invaders.
[03:03:58.535 --> 03:04:00.296]  You can go back to Lucan's Farsali.
[03:04:12.200 --> 03:04:14.021]  I mean, that's what it has been.
[03:04:14.021 --> 03:04:19.023]  But the effect of Gaddafi's resistance has been that the entire timetable was slowed down.
[03:04:19.023 --> 03:04:29.207]  I mean, they wanted Gaddafi gone in March, Assad gone in April or May, and then they'd be on to Algeria by now, and they might even get around to the monarchies, right?
[03:04:29.207 --> 03:04:34.009]  Morocco and Jordan and Saudi Arabia are certainly also on the same list, if they can be.
[03:04:34.649 --> 03:04:35.950]  Intimidated, fine.
[03:04:35.950 --> 03:04:37.631]  If not, they're going to be overthrown.
[03:04:37.631 --> 03:04:43.855]  So Gaddafi has more or less put on the brakes and floated or practically stopped it for six months.
[03:04:43.855 --> 03:04:45.576]  And that's a merit.
[03:04:45.576 --> 03:04:48.098]  Alright, we'll have to follow this more, Webster.
[03:04:48.098 --> 03:04:50.099]  As it unfolds, pray for peace over there.
[03:04:50.099 --> 03:04:53.261]  And I don't mean the type that comes with 2,000 pound bombs.
[03:04:53.261 --> 03:04:55.482]  If you want to, look at my Twitter feed.
[03:04:55.482 --> 03:04:58.064]  You'll find the numbers to the State Department.
[03:04:58.064 --> 03:04:59.105]  Absolutely, Webster.
[03:04:59.105 --> 03:04:59.725]  We're out of time.
[03:04:59.725 --> 03:05:00.946]  See everybody back tomorrow live.
