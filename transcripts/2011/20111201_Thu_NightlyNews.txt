[00:00:23.021 --> 00:00:27.385]  Welcome to the December 1, 2011 broadcast of the Infowars Nightly News.
[00:00:27.465 --> 00:00:28.886]  I'm Aaron Dyk sitting in.
[00:00:29.287 --> 00:00:34.832]  Now coming up we have there the filmmakers who helped bring you What in the World Are They Spraying?
[00:00:34.872 --> 00:00:38.955]  It's Paul Wittenberger and his cohort Chris Maple.
[00:00:39.276 --> 00:00:40.917]  So we'll speak with them in just a moment.
[00:00:41.137 --> 00:00:47.683]  It's indeed a dark day as the Senate is right now moving quote methodically to pass the
[00:00:48.644 --> 00:00:51.025]  National Defense Authorization Act.
[00:00:51.165 --> 00:01:00.928]  It has just rejected on a vote of 55 to 45 the amendment put forward by Dianne Feinstein to limit the provision for indefinite detention.
[00:01:01.988 --> 00:01:12.871]  Senator Rand Paul also worked to keep that out of this massive defense bill as they continue to supposedly try to cut spending, but of course the consequences are far worse.
[00:01:13.331 --> 00:01:15.973]  We are moving more and more towards martial law.
[00:01:15.993 --> 00:01:21.618]  This is stuff that has been ongoing for decades, particularly under the George W. Bush administration.
[00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:28.164]  There were many moves for indefinite detention and more, all kinds of martial law provisions.
[00:01:28.704 --> 00:01:33.126]  John McCain worked with Carl Levin to introduce this current bill.
[00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:39.268]  He's also introduced bills in the past for indefinite detention, including of American citizens.
[00:01:39.648 --> 00:01:45.371]  The Enemy Belligerent Interrogation Detention and Prosecution Act of 2010, for instance, which
[00:01:46.548 --> 00:01:51.791]  Explicitly named US citizens among those who can be detained intentionally without trial.
[00:01:52.411 --> 00:01:54.672]  It's very unfortunate that it looks like they're going to pass.
[00:01:54.712 --> 00:02:01.276]  Of course, President Obama has said he would veto this bill if it does pass, but that's a little solace because
[00:02:01.776 --> 00:02:08.420]  He's primarily leaning on the overreach of executive powers that presidents have passed the baton on for years.
[00:02:08.841 --> 00:02:24.591]  He's actually defending the executive branch's power to indefinitely detain citizens and make the call, even saying that courts have no place to determine whether or not someone should be kept in custody indefinitely or not, that it's solely an executive branch position.
[00:02:25.512 --> 00:02:33.494]  So anyway, let's go now to some of the Dianne Feinstein clip asking them not to put the indefinite detention of the bill again, an amendment which was rejected.
[00:02:34.394 --> 00:02:37.235]  And this constant push that everything has to be militarized.
[00:02:37.335 --> 00:02:38.515]  They were wrong on Hamdi.
[00:02:38.555 --> 00:02:39.456]  They were wrong on Hamdan.
[00:02:39.496 --> 00:02:39.996]  And it keeps going.
[00:02:40.076 --> 00:02:42.657]  And that it is terrible to protect people's rights.
[00:03:02.521 --> 00:03:04.825]  I don't think that creates a safe country.
[00:03:05.466 --> 00:03:09.392]  This country is special because we have certain values.
[00:03:09.853 --> 00:03:13.598]  And due process of law is one of those values.
[00:03:15.666 --> 00:03:19.108]  Of course, the idea behind this bill also brings U.S.
[00:03:19.208 --> 00:03:30.194]  military troops closer to American soil, allowing them essentially to operate, and of course putting American citizens, potentially anyone, in the crosshairs of military action.
[00:03:30.214 --> 00:03:32.995]  Now I want to read some quotes from Kurt Nimmo's article.
[00:03:32.995 --> 00:03:33.375]  We're good.
[00:03:53.335 --> 00:03:59.780]  Raise serious questions as to who we are in society and what our Constitution seeks to protect.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.160]  Of course, that's the whole point.
[00:04:01.461 --> 00:04:10.167]  That's what makes our country different from other ten-pot dictatorships, is things like our Bill of Rights, our individual freedoms, which are not to be infringed upon.
[00:04:10.787 --> 00:04:14.249]  But of course, we have a tyrannical government always moving further along.
[00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.992]  And Kurt Nimmo goes on to discuss how, if the bill were to become law,
[00:04:20.033 --> 00:04:30.860]  Not taking into account what Obama may do with the veto, it would allow the state to disappear domestic political enemies the same way dictator Pinochet in Chile eliminated his political opposition.
[00:04:31.261 --> 00:04:40.567]  Military kidnappings, torture, and secret execution are the tactics of thugs in place like Nazi Germany, Stalinist Russia, and Communist China, not the United States.
[00:04:40.927 --> 00:04:41.768]  Of course that's true.
[00:04:42.208 --> 00:04:47.772]  Just for a little reference, I want to cue a clip from an old movie called Army of Shadows about the
[00:04:48.332 --> 00:05:04.956]  French resistance and they had indefinite detention in those times during World War two based on a book written in the middle of the war in 1943 before all the Holocaust revelations and and the moves to Demonize Nazis as though they were the only ones who abused these powers.
[00:05:04.996 --> 00:05:06.637]  But anyway, let's let's cue these clips
[00:05:08.203 --> 00:05:09.624]  So this is a French language film.
[00:05:09.664 --> 00:05:13.227]  Here they've got a guard tower over a classical internment camp.
[00:05:13.888 --> 00:05:16.290]  Something the United States should not transform into.
[00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:20.013]  But in this clip they go on to discuss indefinite detention.
[00:05:22.115 --> 00:05:26.379]  And here we are at the head of this internment camp saying you never know who you're going to take in or how to treat them.
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.463]  Some have not been convicted or sentenced and stay indefinitely.
[00:05:31.243 --> 00:05:33.265]  Others with terrible records are soon released.
[00:05:34.645 --> 00:05:35.425]  Typical corruption.
[00:05:35.445 --> 00:05:38.586]  It takes senior jobs in local government or even at Vichy.
[00:05:39.306 --> 00:05:41.926]  And they've got here a map of the camps for internment.
[00:05:42.366 --> 00:05:56.949]  And it goes on and some of the members discuss how they were just ordinary businessmen but got caught up in political demonstrations by accident, but were taken to detention centers, held indefinitely, never got a trial, never got an explanation for why they were held.
[00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:01.250]  And this is the kind of thing they're now proposing in the name of the War on Terror.
[00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.311]  Which they say is going to go on forever and ever, as long as the Cold War anyway.
[00:06:05.931 --> 00:06:09.472]  And now somehow it's going to involve American citizens as well.
[00:06:09.812 --> 00:06:12.413]  Very dark days, we'll keep an eye on that.
[00:06:12.833 --> 00:06:18.915]  Whatever happens, the fact that they were proposing this and have seriously put it forward is just appalling.
[00:06:19.275 --> 00:06:28.378]  In other news, Paul Watson and Yi Han have reported earlier today on Chinese generals threatening a third world war to protect Iran.
[00:06:29.478 --> 00:06:32.881]  Both China and Russia have made it clear they will veto any U.N.
[00:06:32.941 --> 00:06:40.107]  authorization of military action against Iran in the aftermath of claims that Iran is on the verge of developing a nuclear weapon.
[00:06:41.348 --> 00:06:45.331]  Then that parallels his other article, Chinese government official U.S.
[00:06:45.371 --> 00:06:48.013]  threat to Pakistan is threat to China.
[00:06:49.054 --> 00:06:51.936]  And gets into statements from a top military general.
[00:06:52.676 --> 00:07:01.700]  It says, according to the report, the United States is massing troops on Pakistan's border in an act of aggression that China sees as a direct threat to its close alliance with the country.
[00:07:02.081 --> 00:07:12.606]  In response, China recently sent large numbers of second artillery PLA troops, armed with sophisticated DF-21C and short-range tactical missiles to China's northwest plateau.
[00:07:13.126 --> 00:07:16.928]  Anyway, the point being that all the stuff going on in the Middle East is
[00:07:17.288 --> 00:07:26.931]  Also part of a larger geopolitical ploy for a long endgame struggle with China, Russia and other sectors of the Grand Chess Board.
[00:07:27.371 --> 00:07:30.291]  But that's the kind of madness we're engaged in in foreign policy.
[00:07:30.331 --> 00:07:33.912]  Another reason we should scale everything back a la Ron Paul.
[00:07:34.332 --> 00:07:36.933]  But he of course is not getting the coverage in the debates.
[00:07:36.993 --> 00:07:39.454]  It's people like Newt Gingrich who we're going to cover in a few moments.
[00:07:40.174 --> 00:07:50.303]  Now in other very dark news, ABC News did an expose of foster children and all the mind-altering drugs they are given.
[00:07:50.784 --> 00:07:51.845]  New study shows U.S.
[00:07:51.885 --> 00:07:56.028]  government fails to oversee treatment of foster children with mind-altering drugs.
[00:07:57.045 --> 00:07:58.126]  We have a number of quotes here.
[00:07:58.466 --> 00:08:03.688]  Overall, the GOA looked at nearly 100,000 foster children in five states only.
[00:08:04.109 --> 00:08:05.609]  Forty-five other states not studied.
[00:08:05.649 --> 00:08:10.392]  Found nearly one-third of foster children were prescribed at least one psychotic drug.
[00:08:10.732 --> 00:08:14.234]  The GOA found foster children were prescribed psychotropic drugs
[00:08:14.674 --> 00:08:25.417]  At rates up to nearly five times higher than non-foster children, with foster children in Texas being the most likely to receive the medications compared with foster children and the other four states studied.
[00:08:25.877 --> 00:08:35.979]  In Texas, foster children were 53 times more likely to be prescribed five or more psychiatric medications at the same time.
[00:08:36.359 --> 00:08:39.260]  Five or more psychiatric medications at the same time.
[00:08:40.459 --> 00:08:41.000]  That's right.
[00:08:59.179 --> 00:09:02.544]  This is absolute Nazi experimentation with our children.
[00:09:02.604 --> 00:09:03.365]  It's disgusting.
[00:09:03.966 --> 00:09:04.867]  The quotes go on here.
[00:09:04.907 --> 00:09:14.561]  Foster children were also more than nine times more likely than non-foster children to be prescribed drugs for which there was no FDA-recommended dose for their age.
[00:09:15.779 --> 00:09:26.193]  For the most vulnerable foster children, those less than one year old, foster children were nearly twice as likely to be prescribed as a psychiatric drug compared to non-foster children.
[00:09:26.534 --> 00:09:31.260]  And it goes on to discuss how these psychotropics were even given to infants.
[00:09:31.281 --> 00:09:32.723]  We have a clip from that report now.
[00:09:33.143 --> 00:09:35.968]  These are the meds that I've been taking since I was four.
[00:09:36.689 --> 00:09:42.219]  One, two, three, eleven, twelve, thirteen.
[00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:43.462]  Lexapro.
[00:09:44.003 --> 00:09:45.445]  The last one is Abilify.
[00:09:47.045 --> 00:10:00.472]  Consider the case of seven-year-old Brooke, taken from a drug-addicted mother, just 43 pounds, but given five mind-altering drugs at the same time, a combination that is deemed too risky even for adults.
[00:10:00.973 --> 00:10:04.835]  And Brooke went from this, being weaned off the strongest medications,
[00:10:06.436 --> 00:10:11.539]  No adult should be receiving the drugs of that different variety.
[00:10:11.739 --> 00:10:12.740]  Certainly not at these ages.
[00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:19.124]  And foster parents who want to help soon learn that if they don't give medications, the child can be taken away.
[00:10:19.264 --> 00:10:21.645]  We were told to put our faith in the system and that's what we did.
[00:10:21.665 --> 00:10:24.267]  No one said the medications could be causing the problem.
[00:10:24.487 --> 00:10:26.488]  They kept saying she needs more medications.
[00:10:27.728 --> 00:10:34.470]  And of course, they're calling this a failure to oversee foster children, where they're much more likely to be abused.
[00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:37.530]  CPS custody, far more likely to be abused.
[00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:39.771]  The system is not good for children.
[00:10:39.791 --> 00:10:43.692]  And of course, this is part of a larger agenda, as we all know.
[00:10:44.272 --> 00:10:46.393]  Why are they prescribing these things in the first place?
[00:10:46.433 --> 00:10:54.855]  But especially in combination with these very vulnerable foster children who don't have good parents to oversee them, etc., because of the situation we're in.
[00:10:55.215 --> 00:10:55.655]  Now, of course,
[00:10:56.155 --> 00:11:12.071]  Alex reported on this in the 2007 film, Endgame, and we have a clip there from a top psychiatric official in Texas saying that it was okay that there were children on up to seven or more psychotropic drugs because they're from a bad gene pool.
[00:11:12.531 --> 00:11:14.894]  Yeah, so tell me this isn't part of the eugenics plan.
[00:11:15.935 --> 00:11:20.019]  Planners said that they'd use mind-altering drugs to control the population.
[00:11:21.556 --> 00:11:24.917]  By 2007, more than 20% of the U.S.
[00:11:24.957 --> 00:11:28.498]  population were on some type of prescription antidepressant.
[00:11:30.938 --> 00:11:42.521]  But in the case of foster children, a sector where the state has total control, at least two-thirds are forced to take a cocktail made up of, on average, seven psychotropic drugs.
[00:11:44.392 --> 00:12:05.025]  Chairman of the Texas Society of Psychiatric Physicians, Joe Burkett, testified before the Statehouse Select Committee hearing on psychotropic drugs in foster care and shocked the public when he said that two-thirds of foster children in Texas had been placed on psychiatric drugs because they were very, very sick from a bad gene pool.
[00:12:06.446 --> 00:12:08.568]  A lot of these kids come from bad gene pools.
[00:12:09.408 --> 00:12:11.870]  They don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[00:12:12.964 --> 00:12:19.850]  Besides the gene pools, they've then been traumatized by abuse, neglect, and problems, and then they've been traumatized by separation and all those things predisposed to mental illness.
[00:12:26.334 --> 00:12:37.424]  Now if you want to get all judgmental about the parents of these foster children and the irresponsible decisions they may or may not have made, don't forget they've said the families of disease.
[00:12:37.865 --> 00:12:44.791]  Organizations like UNESCO have said that the disease of nationalism is spread through the parents and that
[00:12:45.211 --> 00:12:45.351]  Yes.
[00:13:05.612 --> 00:13:15.416]  This case study, but the GOA study does highlight the fact that they are giving massive amounts of mixed together psychotropic drugs to these poor foster children.
[00:13:15.796 --> 00:13:16.476]  Just awful.
[00:13:17.017 --> 00:13:25.680]  In political news, the rise of Newt Gingrich is just another sign that the New World Order is still behind the scenes of both political parties.
[00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:33.484]  Ron Paul has put out a new ad bringing to light the fact that he's a hypocritical flip-flopper, but B,
[00:13:34.804 --> 00:13:39.327]  That his real record is being a globalist for no borders and so on and so forth.
[00:13:39.367 --> 00:13:53.697]  Now, RonPaul2012.com issued this statement including this quote, Our campaign is making a bold move to debunk the myth that the new we are seeing in the 2012 campaign trail is the conservative he has been touted to be all along.
[00:13:54.157 --> 00:14:01.742]  This step we are taking is necessary as voters are seeking authenticity among conservatives who are able to show decades-long career
[00:14:02.102 --> 00:14:05.564]  I think this is the core challenge of America is that beyond the words is a real question of policy.
[00:14:30.732 --> 00:14:35.154]  It's a real question of values, and a real question of seriousness.
[00:14:35.594 --> 00:14:37.254]  It's a real question of policy.
[00:14:39.855 --> 00:14:42.616]  We don't always see eye to eye, do we Newt?
[00:14:43.136 --> 00:14:47.158]  No, but we do agree our country must take action to address climate change.
[00:14:47.478 --> 00:14:52.860]  Newt Gingrich has been on both sides of a long list of issues, sometimes in the same week.
[00:14:54.352 --> 00:14:57.454]  And I believe we're going to play the entire clip during the break.
[00:14:57.514 --> 00:14:59.074]  It's also on Infowars.com.
[00:14:59.355 --> 00:15:01.356]  But what are the real policies of Newt Gingrich?
[00:15:01.696 --> 00:15:04.637]  You've heard about his third wave plan for America.
[00:15:04.998 --> 00:15:10.961]  He wrote the foreword for Alvin and Heidi Toffler's Creating a New Civilization, The Politics of the Third Wave.
[00:15:10.981 --> 00:15:15.403]  Some of the quotes from that book include, nationalism is the first wave.
[00:15:15.823 --> 00:15:27.640]  The globalization of business and finance required by advancing third wave economies routinely punctures the national sovereignty the nationalists hold so dear, obviously part of the larger globalist plan.
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:32.687]  Also, a quote from that book, the Constitution of the United States needs to be reconsidered
[00:15:33.027 --> 00:15:33.207]  I think?
[00:15:54.222 --> 00:15:55.743]  Doing the minion work at best.
[00:15:56.043 --> 00:16:01.906]  Now, of course, Newt supported NAFTA, GATT, other United Nations and globalist treaties.
[00:16:02.266 --> 00:16:05.088]  He was an advisor for Freddie Mac before they went...
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:06.800]  Kaput.
[00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:13.042]  And of course he's a member of Bohemian Grove, the Council on Foreign Relations, and an open border advocate.
[00:16:13.682 --> 00:16:21.464]  And so in other open border news, I covered this this morning, secret US-Canada border deal hides GMO takeover.
[00:16:21.484 --> 00:16:31.867]  Now this is a beyond borders border security perimeter deal that Harper and Obama have been secretly working on for more than a year.
[00:16:31.987 --> 00:16:33.287]  I covered it back in April.
[00:16:33.727 --> 00:16:41.392]  Now, they're set to sign the deal, still secret at this point in time, next week, at which point it'll become, I guess, treaty law.
[00:16:42.093 --> 00:16:43.774]  Now, this bill is significant.
[00:16:43.814 --> 00:16:54.341]  Of course, obviously, it's part of the larger North American Union deal that was leaked, that was also pursued in secrecy, started during the George W. Bush administration in 2005.
[00:16:54.401 --> 00:17:00.865]  They've had a number of meetings since then, and Harper's been part of this all along.
[00:17:01.366 --> 00:17:02.947]  Now, it would merge
[00:17:03.727 --> 00:17:03.947]  Yes.
[00:17:22.381 --> 00:17:30.167]  Surveillance, quote, track everyone coming and leaving Canada by air, land and sea, giving that power to the United States authorities.
[00:17:30.667 --> 00:17:35.751]  But there's more to this secret agreement and the parts that are known about it because it was leaked to the press.
[00:17:36.111 --> 00:17:40.635]  We currently don't know everything about this 32 point border perimeter plan.
[00:17:41.155 --> 00:17:50.844]  What's lying in plain sight here is that they also plan to, quote, streamline and harmonize regulations in the automotive and food sectors.
[00:17:51.364 --> 00:18:05.596]  Now, this is very significant, especially the food sector portion, because it would probably, most likely, many observers believe, open up Canada to a total assault from the biotechnology companies, Monsanto chief among them.
[00:18:06.357 --> 00:18:14.583]  The Council of Canadians reports that what kind of regulatory alignment might we expect to see as a result of the Beyond the Border Action Plan?
[00:18:14.883 --> 00:18:26.952]  The Biotechnology Industry Association asked that both countries adopt consistent science-based processes that would significantly decrease the time required for authorization of biotech crops and their products.
[00:18:27.252 --> 00:18:32.155]  They've asked for a harmonization of the maximum permissible pesticide residual levels.
[00:18:32.756 --> 00:18:35.878]  And again, many Canadians, farmers and activists among them
[00:18:36.078 --> 00:18:36.398]  I think?
[00:18:57.282 --> 00:18:58.263]  We're good to go.
[00:19:21.853 --> 00:19:25.596]  All to do these so-called free trade deals, which are not free at all.
[00:19:25.636 --> 00:19:27.377]  They create trade blocks.
[00:19:27.437 --> 00:19:32.300]  If you don't become a member, then you're essentially discriminated against for your exports.
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:34.101]  So it's all very interesting.
[00:19:34.121 --> 00:19:36.282]  They say the wheat board's probably just the beginning.
[00:19:36.983 --> 00:19:39.824]  They're going to go after the dairy and egg boards as well.
[00:19:39.864 --> 00:19:46.368]  They won't be satisfied until Vetera and Cargill and Monsanto control every bit of farmland in this country.
[00:19:46.388 --> 00:19:49.971]  That's a statement from Member of Parliament Romeo Saganash.
[00:19:50.908 --> 00:19:57.574]  Now these boards in Canada are very socialistic, but at the same time tariffs are not necessarily socialistic.
[00:19:57.975 --> 00:20:01.017]  They're historically part of the American experiment as well.
[00:20:01.658 --> 00:20:08.624]  Makes sense, but it's something all this free trade and globalization has sought to do away with or significantly limit.
[00:20:09.085 --> 00:20:13.149]  And one more thing about GMO introduction in Canada is the
[00:20:13.769 --> 00:20:17.510]  Other issue of low-level presence of GM contamination.
[00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:29.954]  They are also separately seeking to legitimize the export of crops, which are genetically modified and banned in certain countries, such as places in Europe, where they will not accept these crops.
[00:20:29.974 --> 00:20:35.115]  They're now trying to pressure them to accept low-level contaminated GMO crops.
[00:20:35.235 --> 00:20:38.996]  A dangerous slippery slope towards total introduction of GM crops.
[00:20:39.036 --> 00:20:42.457]  Right now, by the way, there's about 30 commercial GM crops
[00:20:42.837 --> 00:20:51.951]  By 2015, a European Commission study estimates there will be more than 120 GMO crops, something to keep an eye on.
[00:20:53.487 --> 00:20:57.249]  In financial news, a very significant headline story here.
[00:20:57.629 --> 00:21:02.091]  A bank courier van spills money on the roadway in Upper St.
[00:21:02.191 --> 00:21:11.155]  Clair and the police have tried to round up the money after the public grabbed it and they recovered only $400 out of tens of thousands.
[00:21:11.796 --> 00:21:15.257]  The police have issued a statement saying this is not a free-for-all situation.
[00:21:15.417 --> 00:21:17.418]  Obviously this money is bank property.
[00:21:17.818 --> 00:21:18.859]  Lieutenant Englert
[00:21:19.219 --> 00:21:19.820]  We're good to go.
[00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:44.503]  The Fed's European rescue, another backdoor U.S.
[00:21:45.464 --> 00:21:55.373]  bank Goldman bailout, where there is more than $7.7 trillion, with a T, of bank subsidies given to various European banks.
[00:21:56.764 --> 00:22:02.866]  And that's just another part of this larger looting that's going to come with the economic collapse.
[00:22:03.006 --> 00:22:13.329]  Also, you heard about the MF Global story, where they came up short on their European bets, and suddenly the pension money and bank accounts from their customers went missing.
[00:22:13.989 --> 00:22:23.792]  Well, now one of the executives from MF Global, who resigned, by the way, in September before the company went bankrupt, has landed a new job.
[00:22:24.372 --> 00:22:27.496]  He's a pension manager now on Wall Street.
[00:22:28.298 --> 00:22:37.971]  New York City Comptroller John Liu has hired former chief executive of MF Global Holdings to help develop and manage the city's pension investments.
[00:22:38.111 --> 00:22:40.695]  MF Global was sued by four public pension systems
[00:22:41.155 --> 00:22:54.599]  Outside New York they claim the firm misrepresented its risk management practices to investors, but now one of those executives has a new cozy job that would be Kevin Davis who was quietly hired back in September.
[00:22:54.619 --> 00:22:56.040]  Another interesting angle.
[00:22:57.577 --> 00:23:03.341]  Now, the Fukushima situation continues to be severe.
[00:23:03.461 --> 00:23:18.111]  TEPCO again underplays severity of situation at Fukushima, writes Kurt Nimmo today, bringing up how the Tokyo Electric Power Company is once again trying to mislead the public on the severity of the situation at the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan.
[00:23:19.469 --> 00:23:22.951]  The government is also actively working to sweep the disaster under the rug.
[00:23:22.991 --> 00:23:32.036]  Its Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare recently eliminated Fukushima data from a patient survey it conducts every three years, according to the Fukushima Diary.
[00:23:32.356 --> 00:23:39.400]  According to the survey, leukemia cases have been increasing seven-fold over the last year, the highest rate since 1978.
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.621]  But there's nothing to see here.
[00:23:42.301 --> 00:23:47.044]  Find out who took the banknotes from the road when the truck spilled them out.
[00:23:48.737 --> 00:23:51.639]  Now in other news, there's a new sex scandal.
[00:23:51.999 --> 00:23:57.443]  Feds charged 20 with luring illegal immigrants to work in the New York area strip clubs.
[00:23:57.483 --> 00:24:08.911]  They're saying it was mob run with Italian and Russian mobs who arranged sham marriages to bring Eastern European and other illegal immigrants into the country.
[00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:13.024]  And to work as strippers and exotic dancers.
[00:24:13.685 --> 00:24:17.189]  And it doesn't mention prostitution here, but I would imagine that's waiting in the wings.
[00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:19.232]  Now, sure, that's a bad scandal.
[00:24:19.252 --> 00:24:26.341]  There is lots of illicit mob and sex trade activity going on, especially in that part of the world.
[00:24:26.741 --> 00:24:32.045]  It spills over to here, but that's kind of the small part of the iceberg that's above the water level.
[00:24:32.385 --> 00:24:40.590]  The large, massive, important part of the iceberg is well below the surface, the thing nobody likes to talk about, but you've heard about it on this program before.
[00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:48.075]  Stuff like the homosexual prostitution inquiry that ensnared VIPs within the Reagan and Bush administration.
[00:24:48.555 --> 00:24:50.897]  Cowboys took midnight tour of the White House.
[00:24:51.397 --> 00:25:02.496]  You heard about the gay porn stars serving moguls, including at places like Bohemian Grove, Chad Savage, a guy who later would visit the George W. Bush White House.
[00:25:03.706 --> 00:25:14.148]  All of us valets in the Grove are tittering about it, says our bohemian blabbermouth, to think there's all these powerful conservative guys having their drinks and food served to them by a gay porn star.
[00:25:14.508 --> 00:25:18.509]  He makes their beds and attends to their every need and they have no idea who he really is.
[00:25:18.529 --> 00:25:27.571]  Of course, even that's just the tip of the iceberg to all the terrible and satanic sexual slavery stuff going on, including in political circles.
[00:25:27.951 --> 00:25:30.112]  There's, of course, all the stuff to do with
[00:25:31.352 --> 00:25:32.313]  We're good to go.
[00:25:51.627 --> 00:25:52.068]  We're good to go.

[00:26:58.621 --> 00:27:04.225]  And we are back from break on this first transmission of December 2001 on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:27:04.605 --> 00:27:08.227]  We're joined now by two filmmakers producing The Great Culling.
[00:27:08.667 --> 00:27:11.489]  It is a follow-up to What in the World Are They Spraying?
[00:27:11.829 --> 00:27:14.911]  Great film on the geoengineering and chemtrail phenomenon.
[00:27:14.951 --> 00:27:16.932]  We have it here at the InfoWars store.
[00:27:17.353 --> 00:27:22.556]  That is director Paul Wittenberg, and he is joined by first-time filmmaker, right, Chris Maple?
[00:27:22.696 --> 00:27:23.136]  That's right.
[00:27:23.536 --> 00:27:24.497]  Thanks for coming on, guys.
[00:27:24.517 --> 00:27:25.678]  Yeah, thanks for having us.
[00:27:26.298 --> 00:27:26.678]  Of course.
[00:27:26.758 --> 00:27:31.300]  So tell us about the previous film and how it led to the new project.
[00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:40.343]  Well, we finished up What In The World Is Brain last year around this time and we started with this new film, The Great Calling, immediately after.
[00:27:40.363 --> 00:27:42.443]  So it's going great.
[00:27:42.523 --> 00:27:49.886]  We just finished up shooting the rest of the interviews and we're going to go into post and finish this up real quick.
[00:27:50.706 --> 00:28:01.130]  What got us really going into the Great Culling, we did, once what in the world of the spraying was completed, we kept hearing these, the resonation of heavy metal contamination in the air.
[00:28:01.751 --> 00:28:09.354]  And we were doing research with the water as well, and the fluoride, and again we keep hearing these, the aluminum kept resonating.
[00:28:09.914 --> 00:28:12.095]  And it's what got us going with the Great Culling.
[00:28:12.115 --> 00:28:16.977]  Because with the Great Culling, in addition to the air, we're also looking at the water, as well as the food.
[00:28:17.117 --> 00:28:18.698]  So our three essential
[00:28:19.998 --> 00:28:21.139]  Thanks for having me.
[00:28:35.052 --> 00:28:48.002]  Certainly, and you're covering stuff like fluoride, you're covering all the stuff in the vaccines and really kind of the modern way of life where cancer is almost an expectation or a one out of several kind of deal.
[00:28:48.622 --> 00:28:50.103]  So what are you guys finding?
[00:28:50.283 --> 00:28:53.746]  Are there important tie-ins with political dimensions?
[00:28:53.786 --> 00:28:57.629]  Does it relate back to this geoengineering plan you've covered so extensively?
[00:28:58.935 --> 00:29:10.823]  I mean, politics does play a role, what we're learning, because at first we weren't completely sure whether or not, you know, this is a big accident or whether there's some design involved here, and that's one thing that we wanted to uncover.
[00:29:11.643 --> 00:29:12.644]  And we have.
[00:29:13.164 --> 00:29:18.768]  We're finding the deeper we go down the rabbit hole that, you know, there is deceit that is taking place.
[00:29:20.689 --> 00:29:26.474]  As far as the, you mentioned vaccinations, that was what really got us going.
[00:29:28.536 --> 00:29:32.079]  Personally, myself, it was seeing these children who were being injured.
[00:29:32.939 --> 00:29:38.604]  I believe back in 1983, it was when the vaccination schedule went from 10 to 36.
[00:29:38.784 --> 00:29:42.948]  I believe it's now 60-something that the kids are taking.
[00:29:43.968 --> 00:29:50.512]  And it wasn't until 1986 that the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act was put into place.
[00:29:51.032 --> 00:29:55.275]  What bothered me the most with that act was that it didn't look at the injured.
[00:29:55.475 --> 00:29:58.757]  What it did was protect the manufacturers.
[00:29:59.457 --> 00:30:05.539]  So there you have that, you know, corporation is being looked after prior to the people.
[00:30:06.519 --> 00:30:16.922]  It wasn't until 1988 that the actual Vaccine Injury Compensation Program was created, where they actually started looking at the injured and compensating them.
[00:30:17.022 --> 00:30:25.024]  So, and that right there, just, you know, if you look at the timelines from 83 to 86, it's a three-year period, I mean, when they increased the schedule.
[00:30:27.144 --> 00:30:35.568]  A perfect amount of time to see what's taking place with these 36 new shots as far as children now showing up on the autistic spectrum.
[00:30:38.149 --> 00:30:44.271]  Like I said, what bothered me the most was that they went after protecting the corporations, the manufacturers, prior to looking at the injured.
[00:30:45.152 --> 00:30:47.293]  It was that fuel that really kind of got me up.
[00:30:48.113 --> 00:30:49.554]  I've always been that kind of person.
[00:30:50.874 --> 00:30:52.975]  I find myself sticking up for other people.
[00:30:54.536 --> 00:30:55.656]  Sometimes people I don't even know.
[00:30:55.676 --> 00:31:00.338]  I can't stand bullies or that sort of thing.
[00:31:00.378 --> 00:31:08.262]  I found myself throughout my life fighting battles that weren't even mine just for people who weren't able to fight them themselves and here we are today.
[00:31:09.224 --> 00:31:09.424]  Yeah.
[00:31:09.965 --> 00:31:11.967]  So the film is called The Great Culling.
[00:31:12.007 --> 00:31:13.969]  We just were able to witness behind the scenes.
[00:31:14.009 --> 00:31:15.230]  You talked to Alex Jones.
[00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:19.935]  Of course, having worked with him on Endgame, I know he's coming from the eugenics angle.
[00:31:20.375 --> 00:31:25.340]  And what really gets me there is stuff like the Gates Foundation and all their overlays.
[00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:28.422]  There's questions about GMO foods.
[00:31:28.463 --> 00:31:29.143]  They're backing it.
[00:31:29.163 --> 00:31:31.305]  There's questions about geoengineering.
[00:31:31.325 --> 00:31:32.026]  What are they spraying?
[00:31:32.406 --> 00:31:33.787]  Gates Foundation is part of it.
[00:31:34.408 --> 00:31:36.329]  They're pushing vaccinations worldwide.
[00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:43.155]  Does it all begin to coalesce into a larger plan or where exactly do you think this is going?
[00:31:44.536 --> 00:31:46.118]  I think it's a mass calling.
[00:31:48.607 --> 00:31:53.212]  I don't believe that it has anything to do with weather modification.
[00:31:53.232 --> 00:31:55.214]  I don't believe in climate control.
[00:31:57.517 --> 00:32:08.088]  Personally, as we're learning, as they're blanketing the landscape and the air above us, of course it's coming down on us eventually because it's evident in the pH levels in the soils.
[00:32:08.929 --> 00:32:14.913]  You have companies like Monsanto, as you know, who are already patented aluminum-resistant seeds.
[00:32:16.674 --> 00:32:23.559]  Personally, I think it's much more sinister than just cooling the planet, because as we're learning, it's not cooling the planet.
[00:32:23.719 --> 00:32:26.240]  It's having an inverse effect.
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:30.123]  It's actually heating the planet up with the aerosols.
[00:32:32.045 --> 00:32:48.694]  I mean it really is a huge topic and so I think it's important to cover these different issues like vaccines and chemtrails and fluoride and just wake the people up because it's such an important thing that people know.
[00:32:48.854 --> 00:32:49.714]  Somebody needs to do it.
[00:32:51.455 --> 00:32:56.040]  And, you know, with the help, with the hope with this film is that, you know, personally I'm not a filmmaker.
[00:32:56.901 --> 00:32:57.762]  I'm a photographer.
[00:32:58.663 --> 00:32:59.644]  Paul's the filmmaker.
[00:32:59.664 --> 00:33:00.525]  He's a dear friend of mine.
[00:33:00.545 --> 00:33:01.646]  I've known him for quite some time.
[00:33:01.706 --> 00:33:07.452]  I've worked, you know, a little with him behind the scenes, I went in the world as far as, you know, with edits and making suggestions and that sort of thing.
[00:33:08.633 --> 00:33:17.155]  And it's just a matter of awareness, raising the conscious level of society, right?
[00:33:17.315 --> 00:33:23.937]  And I think, you know, I'm a pretty good example of somebody like saying enough's enough, like I feel now compelled, I gotta do something.
[00:33:24.597 --> 00:33:27.118]  Not everybody has to go out and make a documentary film either, I just think...
[00:33:28.178 --> 00:33:28.699]  We're good to go.
[00:33:51.618 --> 00:33:54.121]  Everybody does, but that's what's great about the internet age.
[00:33:54.481 --> 00:33:58.686]  You can make a film very cheaply or you could do a blog for free and get the word out.
[00:33:59.066 --> 00:34:00.347]  And the information's out there too.
[00:34:00.388 --> 00:34:04.332]  You just have to discover it and put it together and try to understand what's going on.
[00:34:04.452 --> 00:34:08.877]  So let's highlight some of the hard information we're going to get into in this film.
[00:34:08.897 --> 00:34:12.360]  I know it's still under production and probably still developing as well.
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:14.280]  Tell us a little more.
[00:34:16.382 --> 00:34:18.784]  We've met with a wide range of folks.
[00:34:18.824 --> 00:34:21.966]  We've met with former Senator Karen Johnson.
[00:34:24.425 --> 00:34:25.846]  Over in Arizona, right?
[00:34:26.006 --> 00:34:26.967]  And she was great.
[00:34:27.767 --> 00:34:32.851]  One thing that she opened our eyes to is when she was in office.
[00:34:33.931 --> 00:34:44.118]  She said that it only took between five and seven people calling in to her office, making us think about something, to raise awareness within her office.
[00:34:44.898 --> 00:34:48.621]  If they got five to seven phone calls on an issue, that was priority of the day.
[00:34:49.341 --> 00:34:54.022]  So, and that really made me step back and say, wow, I mean, you really don't need a million people marching in the street.
[00:34:54.062 --> 00:35:04.226]  It was just a simple five people making phone calls to their local, you know, legislator and, you know, making a complaint or a suggestion or something of that nature.
[00:35:04.266 --> 00:35:10.187]  So, that was an eye-opener for us to realize that, wow, there might be some hope as far as awareness.
[00:35:12.708 --> 00:35:13.549]  Also, what do we have?
[00:35:13.909 --> 00:35:17.290]  Dr. Reema Labow, she
[00:35:18.490 --> 00:35:19.731]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:35:36.342 --> 00:35:38.543]  I believe his show, The Conspiracy Theory.
[00:35:38.563 --> 00:35:39.364]  Yeah, The Conspiracy Theory.
[00:35:39.644 --> 00:35:40.345]  Right, exactly.
[00:35:40.485 --> 00:35:45.028]  And she said, one of her patients at the time was a head of state.
[00:35:45.648 --> 00:35:48.570]  She had mentioned, be prepared for the Great Culling.
[00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:49.431]  It's about to begin.
[00:35:49.451 --> 00:35:52.633]  And Dr. LeBeau was, what do you mean, the Great Culling?
[00:35:52.693 --> 00:35:54.635]  And she eventually got herself out of America.
[00:35:56.596 --> 00:35:59.079]  Clifford Carnicom, we talked with him as well.
[00:35:59.159 --> 00:36:01.481]  He went over contrail science with us.
[00:36:02.142 --> 00:36:08.348]  You know, how contrails formed, what's the difference between these aerosols that we're seeing and what is a true contrail.
[00:36:08.788 --> 00:36:13.893]  That's something that we're trying to focus on as well because it doesn't take much for people to go outside and
[00:36:14.694 --> 00:36:29.641]  Just take a mental observation on a daily basis, just to take a peek up, look what's going on above your head, start realizing that why does this one have a tail, why is this one not, what's different today than yesterday, where are all these planes today?
[00:36:30.101 --> 00:36:32.042]  They were spraying yesterday, there's nothing up there today.
[00:36:32.983 --> 00:36:35.124]  So he shed some light there.
[00:36:35.904 --> 00:36:43.408]  Paul Conant, Dr. Conant, again, he's a huge fluoride, anti-fluoride promoter.
[00:36:44.568 --> 00:36:50.337]  He enlightened us as far as... We'll get into why Florida is so important as an issue.
[00:36:51.499 --> 00:36:52.480]  Why it's important?
[00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:53.401]  Yeah.
[00:36:54.323 --> 00:36:56.386]  Why is it so bad or why is it so important?
[00:36:56.927 --> 00:36:58.910]  Well, I mean, what are you exploring in the film specifically?
[00:36:59.706 --> 00:37:10.053]  With the fluoride, what we're learning is through the fluoride, what it's doing is it's wearing down the myelin sheath, which is the fatty insulation that surrounds all our nerve endings.
[00:37:10.774 --> 00:37:13.195]  So we are having electrical short-outs.
[00:37:14.896 --> 00:37:16.898]  Uh, with the fluoride and the aluminum.
[00:37:16.938 --> 00:37:20.160]  All these metals are wearing down the myelin sheath within our body.
[00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:22.461]  And as you know, on the atomic level, we're energy.
[00:37:22.481 --> 00:37:23.222]  We're vibrating.
[00:37:23.262 --> 00:37:33.309]  This is kind of where the film kind of got a lot of its, uh, it was, you know, its fuel from is, is the, the, the, the energy sources that were, A, we're surrounded by energy.
[00:37:33.389 --> 00:37:38.693]  And as you know, Nikola Tesla, you know, had figured that out at the, you know, the turn of the 20th century.
[00:37:38.713 --> 00:37:41.895]  Um, and not only are we surrounded, but we're made up of it.
[00:37:42.235 --> 00:37:42.675]  And, um,
[00:37:43.636 --> 00:37:47.977]  When you have a thought to wiggle your toes or speak, it's an electrical current.
[00:37:48.137 --> 00:37:52.218]  And it doesn't just stay within your body, it actually escapes throughout the universe.
[00:37:52.859 --> 00:37:57.400]  And what better way to shut down those currents and disrupt them than with metals?
[00:37:57.460 --> 00:37:58.980]  And that was our hunch all along.
[00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:05.642]  And the more and more we dig down this hole and speak with all these PhDs and dentists and that sort of thing, they're like, yeah, you're right on the mark.
[00:38:06.302 --> 00:38:09.463]  It is wearing down the Myelin sheath.
[00:38:09.503 --> 00:38:10.663]  We're basically shorting out.
[00:38:10.683 --> 00:38:12.524]  Well, that's what others have called dumbing us down.
[00:38:13.848 --> 00:38:14.208]  Perfect.
[00:38:15.389 --> 00:38:24.031]  And with the fluoride, as you mentioned, and I tell people all the time, I say, well, if this stuff doesn't bother you, then you can thank your fluoride for that, because it does make you complacent.
[00:38:24.051 --> 00:38:40.717]  And it's like the GMO studies, the studies show it causes organ failure, sterility, but they won't label it, so there's that deniability factor, no tracing, you can't prove that's what caused your problems, and so it's a soft kill, kind of, it hits everyone in a kind of scatter shot.
[00:38:41.497 --> 00:38:45.439]  Well, a lot of people are concerned with, well, heck, I don't drink tap water.
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:47.741]  I drink this bottled water right here.
[00:38:47.781 --> 00:38:48.861]  I don't drink tap water.
[00:38:48.881 --> 00:38:50.802]  A lot of people these days say, I don't drink tap water.
[00:38:50.822 --> 00:38:52.063]  I don't even drink it.
[00:38:52.183 --> 00:38:53.604]  But are you bathing in it?
[00:38:54.244 --> 00:38:57.386]  Our skin is one of the biggest organs that we have.
[00:38:57.566 --> 00:38:58.487]  It's going to absorb it.
[00:39:00.008 --> 00:39:04.334]  Are you watering your garden with fluoride-free water?
[00:39:05.075 --> 00:39:05.816]  Cooking with it?
[00:39:05.917 --> 00:39:07.539]  Buying food that was cooked with it?
[00:39:07.639 --> 00:39:08.500]  Cooking with everything!
[00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:09.962]  Orange juice, your milk, your beer, anything with water!
[00:39:15.029 --> 00:39:15.470]  We're good to go.
[00:39:38.086 --> 00:39:39.828]  Well, obviously there's a lot going on.
[00:39:39.868 --> 00:39:42.031]  We're very interested to see how the film develops.
[00:39:42.612 --> 00:39:46.116]  And you're still taking influence and support for the film.
[00:39:46.157 --> 00:39:47.058]  Tell me about the website.
[00:39:47.678 --> 00:39:51.220]  The website is thegreatcalling.org.
[00:39:53.482 --> 00:39:57.184]  Folks can get on the website, take a look around.
[00:39:57.524 --> 00:39:59.565]  We've put a lot of information up there.
[00:39:59.625 --> 00:40:00.806]  We have some stills.
[00:40:02.367 --> 00:40:04.408]  We're looking for support as well.
[00:40:04.428 --> 00:40:05.709]  We kind of want to wrap this thing up.
[00:40:05.749 --> 00:40:14.895]  We anticipated December, but we're just a two-man show and we have other jobs that we need to do to try to fund this thing on our own.
[00:40:17.376 --> 00:40:20.877]  You know, now we're kind of pushing it to March, right?
[00:40:21.097 --> 00:40:29.581]  Yeah, and so right now we're just really giving a call out to get people in to help us, and so we can get this thing done and out to the public.
[00:40:30.001 --> 00:40:41.745]  And for Du and I, the last film I know woke up a lot of people, got them to focus on the issue and say, well, there's credible reason for these questions, and I think it's awakening a lot of people who haven't studied it in depth, but have kind of heard about it.
[00:40:42.245 --> 00:40:45.367]  In passing, and hopefully this film will do a lot of the same thing.
[00:40:45.407 --> 00:40:46.108]  The Great Culling.
[00:40:46.288 --> 00:40:47.109]  Coming soon, I guess.
[00:40:47.709 --> 00:40:47.829]  Yeah.
[00:40:47.849 --> 00:40:49.610]  Well, thanks for joining us, guys, and good luck.
