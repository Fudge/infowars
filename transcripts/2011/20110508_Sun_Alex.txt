[00:00:04.909 --> 00:00:09.733]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:11.334]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.334 --> 00:00:12.876]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.876 --> 00:00:17.079]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:21.143]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:38.603]  Yeah.
[00:00:46.917 --> 00:00:49.858]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[00:00:49.858 --> 00:00:55.279]  I was busy talking to Dr. Pachinik and got back on air a little bit late.
[00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:56.280]  I apologize for that.
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.821]  He's going to be joining us coming up during the next segment.
[00:00:59.821 --> 00:01:15.625]  He developed some of the major psychological warfare programs that are currently used today, and he's clearly looked at this latest Bin Laden killing and said you can see all the scripting with PSYOP, but he can confirm that he was dead.
[00:01:16.325 --> 00:01:20.428]  Pre-2002, as he did on the air in April of 2002 with us.
[00:01:20.428 --> 00:01:31.756]  So we're going to break down from a former Black Op mastermind exactly what is going on here.
[00:01:31.756 --> 00:01:36.900]  And again, recapping why they've done this, but even more important, why
[00:01:38.667 --> 00:01:44.810]  They staged 9-11 and here is the article where you can read part of his extensive bio and learn more.
[00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:45.370]  Top U.S.
[00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:52.374]  government insider Bin Laden died in 2001 9-1-1 a false flag.
[00:01:52.374 --> 00:01:58.017]  That is up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:01:59.378 --> 00:02:03.121]  And we look forward to having him on with us for 15 minutes of the next hour.
[00:02:03.121 --> 00:02:04.783]  It'll really just be an hour of air time.
[00:02:04.783 --> 00:02:09.847]  When we come back, I'm going to go over some of his bio and this article just so people know exactly who they're listening to.
[00:02:09.847 --> 00:02:14.811]  And then, also, he's been in so many missions, involved in so many things.
[00:02:14.811 --> 00:02:21.617]  He is the character that Jack Ryan in the Patriot Games series is based on.
[00:02:23.138 --> 00:02:27.324]  He, and that's on record, he's co-authored many of the books with Tom Clancy.
[00:02:27.324 --> 00:02:33.914]  He's also, you go to IMDb, the producer on films like Netforce and others.
[00:02:33.914 --> 00:02:36.458]  I mean, just incredible, and nobody knows what he looks like.
[00:02:37.307 --> 00:02:40.631]  And he's here with us today because he wants you to know the truth.
[00:02:40.631 --> 00:02:44.615]  I hope people realize the magnitude of this.
[00:02:44.615 --> 00:02:47.458]  And obviously, we'll let things settle out.
[00:02:47.458 --> 00:02:54.666]  And if he can do it, come back on with us again next week as things continue to unfold.
[00:02:54.666 --> 00:02:57.729]  So we're going to be breaking all of that down today.
[00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:14.741]  He of course is a board examiner level psychiatrist, ran many large mental institutions, also worked under five presidents, three state departments, and just involved in innumerable secret and clandestine operations.
[00:03:14.741 --> 00:03:19.364]  Maybe I should get him out of the gates to tell us about some of the stuff that he can now talk about.
[00:03:20.764 --> 00:03:30.387]  Just so people know how important this information is and the fact that he's risking a lot coming on air and saying that he talked to a top U.S.
[00:03:30.387 --> 00:03:38.169]  general who could confirm 9-11 was an inside job and he's ready to testify before a federal or state grand jury right now.
[00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:40.950]  This is big news.
[00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.171]  He's not playing games and this is the real deal.
[00:03:45.171 --> 00:03:48.312]  But as he pointed out yesterday, he's not really risking anything.
[00:03:49.336 --> 00:03:53.398]  Because if we don't turn this around, folks, there is no society, there is no future.
[00:03:53.398 --> 00:04:14.108]  I mean, every time I look at my dear little children, how sweet and innocent and good they are, and there's always corruption, there's always problems, but when you stop resisting it, when you just give in to it, when you let total delusion rule the day, it infects all of society, then total confidence is lost, and you become a banana republic.
[00:04:14.108 --> 00:04:15.869]  And we are on our way to that, right now.
[00:04:18.567 --> 00:04:22.349]  The controllers try to sell us on how much they want to protect us.
[00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:30.613]  The meme they're pushing right now is that the government's job is to protect you.
[00:04:30.613 --> 00:04:31.593]  And that's the most important.
[00:04:31.593 --> 00:04:36.616]  I heard them on the radio and TV saying, don't worry about gas prices, don't worry about the dollar plunging.
[00:04:36.616 --> 00:04:38.317]  It's national security, keep us safe.
[00:04:39.807 --> 00:04:46.592]  Well, what's most important is the Bill of Rights, Constitution, Declaration of Independence, the free market, private property, the family.
[00:04:46.592 --> 00:04:56.480]  That's the engine that the limited government is supposed to protect, not protect me by having checkpoints on the highways everywhere, which they're now announcing CBS News.
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.663]  We'll talk about it all with Dr. Steve Pichetnik straight ahead.
[00:05:01.158 --> 00:05:02.880]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.186]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:05:08.186 --> 00:05:09.728]  Saving means to make money.
[00:05:09.728 --> 00:05:18.518]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:05:19.239 --> 00:05:26.786]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:05:26.786 --> 00:05:34.792]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:05:34.792 --> 00:05:42.139]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you had to do something you've never done before, getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800
[00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:44.139]  Well, for the next hour,
[00:06:12.638 --> 00:06:16.697]  And change, Dr. Steve Pachinik is our guest.
[00:06:17.799 --> 00:06:25.545]  He served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State and Senior Policy Planner under Secretaries Henry Kissinger, Cyrus Vance, George Shultz, and James Baker.
[00:06:25.545 --> 00:06:28.628]  Dr. Progenic continues to consult the Department of Defense.
[00:06:28.628 --> 00:06:37.375]  He received a Council on Foreign Relations CFR Fellowship where he was recruited by Lawrence Eagleburger as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Management.
[00:06:37.375 --> 00:06:43.100]  In the position, he was created the Office of Combat Terrorism, the Family Liaison Office,
[00:06:45.037 --> 00:06:51.218]  He recognized the medical department within the State Department and merged and reorganized the Department of Cultural Affairs and the U.S.
[00:06:51.218 --> 00:06:56.099]  Information Agency into one organization, the International Communications Agency.
[00:06:56.099 --> 00:06:59.820]  Dr. Pachinik is the author and creator of 26 New York Times bestsellers.
[00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.460]  He's the advisor to Tom Clancy.
[00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:03.540]  That's how Clancy knows all that stuff.
[00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:10.022]  His experiences in government and international crisis management were the basis of Tom Clancy's characters Jack Ryan and Richard Clarke.
[00:07:10.022 --> 00:07:11.542]  You can go to IMDb and see that
[00:07:12.122 --> 00:07:12.342]  I don't
[00:07:24.656 --> 00:07:26.657]  Really an interesting type.
[00:07:26.657 --> 00:07:27.458]  Psychiatrist.
[00:07:27.458 --> 00:07:32.642]  A lot of times you find those type of guys right up at the top of black ops, psychological warfare.
[00:07:32.642 --> 00:07:33.863]  I did more research on him.
[00:07:33.863 --> 00:07:36.565]  I mean, I knew who he was nine plus years ago when I interviewed him.
[00:07:36.565 --> 00:07:40.808]  And it really blew me away how much he doesn't toot his horn.
[00:07:40.808 --> 00:07:44.490]  In fact, looking around here in my stack, I'm looking for my London Telegraph article.
[00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:44.931]  U.S.
[00:07:44.931 --> 00:07:51.636]  envoy admits role in Aldo Moro killing the former Italian prime minister.
[00:07:53.232 --> 00:07:56.414]  Overthrowing governments.
[00:07:56.414 --> 00:07:59.036]  I mean, he is Jack Ryan, and then some.
[00:07:59.036 --> 00:08:08.263]  That character, that's why we've got Harrison Ford's image up there as Jack Ryan today, since we don't have a photo of a Dr. Pachinik.
[00:08:08.263 --> 00:08:15.089]  And, I mean, I gotta say, at certain levels, you know, they make it mythical, the Navy SEALs and the Delta Force and all that stuff.
[00:08:15.089 --> 00:08:15.769]  I mean, this guy
[00:08:16.983 --> 00:08:25.277]  If people like to get scared of those types, people ought to really be creeped out in a way by just how much this guy knows where he's been.
[00:08:25.277 --> 00:08:26.138]  He's a scary guy.
[00:08:26.138 --> 00:08:29.544]  I know he's going to probably laugh at that in a minute, but the point is...
[00:08:32.157 --> 00:08:40.160]  You know, putting out disinfo, I'm going to say this is true, so the Red Brigades would go ahead and kill him because they thought it would destabilize Italy if they didn't.
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:41.360]  I mean, just wild.
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.421]  I mean, it goes on and on.
[00:08:44.421 --> 00:08:59.225]  For the Pentagon setting up the modern black op program that's run today, this is the ultimate guy to get on to analyze the black op we saw Sunday, the disinfo, the cartoonishness of it.
[00:08:59.225 --> 00:09:00.786]  He comes on air and tells us.
[00:09:02.391 --> 00:09:04.033]  That yes, 9-11 is an inside job.
[00:09:04.033 --> 00:09:10.177]  It's ready to testify to a federal or state grand jury on the top general at the time that was in the military.
[00:09:10.177 --> 00:09:11.478]  That yes, it was an inside job.
[00:09:11.478 --> 00:09:12.479]  They stood down.
[00:09:12.479 --> 00:09:13.980]  It was a black cop.
[00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:18.003]  Of course, I've got the local footage of the police saying, get back, they're going to blow up building seven.
[00:09:18.003 --> 00:09:22.887]  And the firefighters about the molten steel and the blast charges going off the free fall.
[00:09:22.887 --> 00:09:26.030]  I mean, the NORAD stand down, the Cheney order.
[00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:28.031]  I mean, people say, where's the evidence?
[00:09:28.031 --> 00:09:29.592]  There's too much evidence.
[00:09:29.592 --> 00:09:30.693]  It hides in plain view.
[00:09:32.793 --> 00:09:41.218]  We're seeing record Facebook accounts being deleted, MySpace, people being knocked off major news site comments where they normally allowed to send.
[00:09:41.218 --> 00:09:48.283]  The system is scared to death right now, and I can officially tell you this blew up in their face.
[00:09:48.283 --> 00:09:59.010]  Now, I want to go to Dr. Pachinik here in just a moment, because he doesn't want to toot his horn, but I mean, if he could, just people know how serious, because you can just Google his name.
[00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:00.111]  I spent over an hour last night
[00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:01.150]  Just
[00:10:17.592 --> 00:10:18.253]  It goes on.
[00:10:18.253 --> 00:10:25.262]  And of course, Ethan Hunt, that's the name of the guy in Mission Impossible, and they admit that's the character of E. Howard Hunt.
[00:10:25.262 --> 00:10:28.866]  We got the deathbed confession here first of them pulling the trigger on JFK.
[00:10:28.866 --> 00:10:29.547]  Top U.S.
[00:10:29.547 --> 00:10:32.110]  government insider, bin Laden died in 2001.
[00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:33.873]  9-1-1 a false flag.
[00:10:33.873 --> 00:10:34.333]  Top U.S.
[00:10:34.333 --> 00:10:35.975]  government insider, Dr. Steve Pucinich.
[00:10:36.616 --> 00:10:57.511]  A man who held numerous different influential posts under five different presidents, but under the Secretary of State under three, still works for the Defense Department, shockingly told Alex Jones Show yesterday that Osama Bin Laden died in 2001, and that he was prepared to testify in front of a grand jury on how top general told him directly that 9-11 was a false flag inside job.
[00:10:57.511 --> 00:10:59.753]  I mean, this is the kind of stuff that can get us killed, folks.
[00:11:00.413 --> 00:11:00.833]  I think?
[00:11:16.025 --> 00:11:16.406]  I don't know.
[00:11:32.723 --> 00:11:35.926]  Uh, on to develop the basic tenets of psychological warfare.
[00:11:35.926 --> 00:11:37.108]  This is from the Pentagon.
[00:11:37.108 --> 00:11:44.415]  The basic modern tenets of psychological warfare, counter-terrorism strategy and tactics for transcultural negotiations.
[00:11:44.415 --> 00:11:47.217]  That's the anthropology, sociology for the U.S.
[00:11:47.217 --> 00:11:48.519]  Department of State.
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:52.043]  Military and intelligence communities, other agencies, the U.S.
[00:11:52.043 --> 00:11:59.132]  government, while also developing foundational strategies for hostage rescue that were later employed around the world.
[00:11:59.132 --> 00:12:03.336]  Petrennik also served as senior policy planner under Secretary Henry Kissinger.
[00:12:04.597 --> 00:12:04.717]  See
[00:12:26.796 --> 00:12:35.520]  Research and all the other experts I'm talking to, Hamid Ghul's agreeing, former head of Pakistani intelligence, General Ghul, Webster Tarpley, Wayne Madsen, NSA.
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:38.822]  I know I'm ranting, sir.
[00:12:38.822 --> 00:12:41.383]  I apologize.
[00:12:41.383 --> 00:12:43.684]  I want to get into some of the other issues you wanted to cover today.
[00:12:43.684 --> 00:12:50.487]  But since we talked 24 hours ago or 22 hours ago, to be technical, this is clearly blowing up in their face.
[00:12:50.487 --> 00:12:51.488]  Do you agree?
[00:12:51.488 --> 00:12:53.709]  And how dangerous are these cornered rats now?
[00:12:55.404 --> 00:13:03.774]  Well, I think, you know, when you tell a lie, you're going to unwind that lie by the very fact that you've created a lie.
[00:13:03.774 --> 00:13:11.003]  The nature of creating a lie in psychological warfare is that you have to be consistent, make sure that all the details
[00:13:11.463 --> 00:13:13.265]  Are intertwined and are credible.
[00:13:13.265 --> 00:13:14.466]  It's almost like a movie.
[00:13:14.466 --> 00:13:24.954]  So you gotta think of the President of the United States, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mullen, who by the way, his father was a publicist for the William Morris Agency, and then the intelligence community.
[00:13:24.954 --> 00:13:29.637]  It's not an accident that you have this entirely contrived story.
[00:13:29.637 --> 00:13:30.818]  It's not credible.
[00:13:30.818 --> 00:13:35.482]  It's just like you had Disneyland with a key character who's already dead.
[00:13:36.395 --> 00:13:52.213]  And in order to reaffirm the storyline, that is, to make sure that the President of the United States looked good, a man like Axelrod or all his advisors, including Obama himself, was particularly suited to the lie, distortions, and deception, because that's how he came to power.
[00:13:52.213 --> 00:13:54.275]  That's how a George Bush Jr.
[00:13:54.275 --> 00:13:55.056]  comes to power.
[00:13:55.496 --> 00:13:58.018]  He sits down with a bunch of his own cronies.
[00:13:58.018 --> 00:14:02.302]  They sit down and group-think, which you've talked about before on your radio.
[00:14:02.302 --> 00:14:09.909]  Every one of the national security advisors who have their roles there because they're betweens and they're sycophants to the president.
[00:14:09.909 --> 00:14:17.275]  They're all kowtowing down, come together, and create this fictional story in psychological warfare that makes no sense.
[00:14:17.575 --> 00:14:31.325]  And many of the present people in psychological warfare were never trained 20, 30 years ago because they didn't understand the psychology, they don't understand the anthropology, they don't understand that the American public, you do not psyops the American public.
[00:14:31.325 --> 00:14:46.896]  That was a rule of thumb that we had under four to five presidents, that if you tried to psyops the American public, and it broke when you had George Bush Jr., when he created the psychological warfare, and then created the 9-11 through deception, distortion, false flag,
[00:14:47.356 --> 00:14:48.557]  Stand down.
[00:14:48.557 --> 00:14:51.239]  And then we had before him, we had Lyndon Baines Johnson.
[00:14:51.239 --> 00:14:55.742]  It goes on both sides when he created distortion of a false flag in the Gulf of Phuket.
[00:14:55.742 --> 00:14:58.164]  We went into the war in Vietnam.
[00:14:58.164 --> 00:15:09.952]  And we had FDR, as Donald Rumsfeld stupidly accused and said that if anybody like the Kinnick is accusing the Republicans of creating 9-11, Rumsfeld said that's on public September 12th.
[00:15:11.132 --> 00:15:22.339]  9-Eleven, 2011, he said, 2001, he said, Steve Kucinich, if he accuses us, the Republicans of 9-Eleven, then we have to accuse Franklin Roosevelt of doing a stand-out.
[00:15:22.339 --> 00:15:27.763]  Well, of course I accuse him of doing a stand-out, because Paul Wolfowitz, the neocon, Salman Khalilzad,
[00:15:28.863 --> 00:15:39.488]  Uh, uh, uh, uh, Brian Fukuyama, you had Dennis Ross, you had Richard Perle, and you had Scooter Libby, all trained at the University of Chicago under Wollstetter.
[00:15:39.488 --> 00:15:41.088]  And what was your topic?
[00:15:41.088 --> 00:15:45.150]  Stand down in a false flag in Pearl Harbor at the University of Chicago when I was at MIT.
[00:16:00.011 --> 00:16:04.554]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:16:04.554 --> 00:16:05.475]  Number 1.
[00:16:05.475 --> 00:16:08.897]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:16:08.897 --> 00:16:09.758]  Number 2.
[00:16:09.758 --> 00:16:14.641]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:16:14.641 --> 00:16:15.381]  It's true.
[00:16:15.381 --> 00:16:20.265]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:16:20.265 --> 00:16:21.085]  Number 3.
[00:16:21.085 --> 00:16:24.667]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:16:24.667 --> 00:16:28.350]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:29.371]  Number 4.
[00:16:29.371 --> 00:16:32.134]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:16:32.134 --> 00:16:35.818]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:16:35.818 --> 00:16:36.598]  Number 5.
[00:16:36.598 --> 00:16:40.763]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:16:40.763 --> 00:16:45.528]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:16:45.808 --> 00:16:49.975]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:16:49.975 --> 00:16:51.758]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:16:51.758 --> 00:16:54.022]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[00:17:00.231 --> 00:17:07.176]  Over the last year, Alex has told you about and many of you have experienced emergencies and disasters in unprecedented numbers.
[00:17:07.176 --> 00:17:09.818]  People have had to literally run for their lives.
[00:17:09.818 --> 00:17:12.260]  Folks, this is Steve Schenck with Ifoots Direct.
[00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:16.644]  I'm not here to scare you, but when disaster strikes, you won't have time to think.
[00:17:16.644 --> 00:17:18.105]  You must act automatically.
[00:17:18.345 --> 00:17:21.848]  What does a pilot do when the helicopter engine fails in flight?
[00:17:21.848 --> 00:17:24.611]  No time to think, just act automatically.
[00:17:24.611 --> 00:17:32.979]  When the alert is broadcast, the alarm sounds, or the knock comes on your door, you'll need to be ready to act without thinking of what to do or what you need.
[00:17:32.979 --> 00:17:35.762]  You need a 5-Day Extreme Emergency Kit.
[00:17:36.002 --> 00:17:45.689]  With serious supplies and real food to secure two adults for five days, this powerful $300 Extreme Emergency Kit is free with an order of at least $995 from eFoodsDirect.
[00:17:45.689 --> 00:17:47.771]  Go to eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex or call 800-409-5633.
[00:17:47.771 --> 00:17:50.233]  That's eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex.
[00:17:50.233 --> 00:17:50.273]  800-409-5633.
[00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:00.981]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:18:00.981 --> 00:18:07.907]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:18:07.907 --> 00:18:10.469]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:18:10.469 --> 00:18:15.854]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:18:15.854 --> 00:18:18.896]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:18:18.896 --> 00:18:20.958]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:18:21.198 --> 00:18:27.463]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:18:27.463 --> 00:18:30.826]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:18:30.826 --> 00:18:36.611]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:18:36.611 --> 00:18:38.253]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:18:38.253 --> 00:18:39.554]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:18:39.554 --> 00:18:42.056]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:18:42.216 --> 00:18:46.442]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:18:46.442 --> 00:18:51.068]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:18:51.068 --> 00:18:53.652]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[00:19:01.428 --> 00:19:05.389]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:19:05.389 --> 00:19:14.250]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:18.891]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:19:18.891 --> 00:19:29.693]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:19:30.333 --> 00:19:39.855]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:19:39.855 --> 00:19:45.277]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:19:45.277 --> 00:19:52.758]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:19:52.758 --> 00:19:55.519]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:20:00.976 --> 00:20:02.517]  Coast to coast.
[00:20:02.517 --> 00:20:04.557]  Direct from Austin.
[00:20:04.557 --> 00:20:12.420]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:21.944]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[00:20:21.944 --> 00:20:23.504]  Thomas Jefferson.
[00:20:23.504 --> 00:20:27.186]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:20:41.448 --> 00:20:42.689]  So what happens now?
[00:20:42.689 --> 00:20:51.415]  What happens now when you've distorted the story and you can't get a consistency, just as we saw in George Bush Jr., which was, well, we have weapons of mass destruction.
[00:20:51.415 --> 00:20:52.956]  Suddenly, there's a reality testing.
[00:20:52.956 --> 00:20:54.537]  There is no weapons of mass destruction.
[00:20:54.537 --> 00:21:07.365]  Then suddenly, the military, our formidable military, our generals, and our army generals in particular, are forced to change their intelligence in order to be consistent with the White House.
[00:21:07.365 --> 00:21:11.208]  But thank God for a lot of our CIA operatives who were not on contract.
[00:21:11.528 --> 00:21:23.434]  Well, sir, that's what, I want to stop you, doctor, and continue, but that's what Ray McGovern, I don't know if you knew him, but he was the morning briefer for Reagan and Bush Sr.
[00:21:23.434 --> 00:21:24.294]  Did you know him?
[00:21:40.625 --> 00:21:41.746]  No, I knew of them.
[00:21:41.746 --> 00:21:43.207]  Well, Ray says the same thing.
[00:21:43.207 --> 00:21:49.072]  He says they can't even do real national security assessments anymore because it's all wild land.
[00:21:49.072 --> 00:22:00.560]  And once you put a PSYOP out into the public, the way the human brain works and all individuals being limited in their perception, it then is taken back and received by your own system.
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:06.705]  And it basically, for lack of a better word, makes the military industrial complex drink their own Kool-Aid.
[00:22:07.833 --> 00:22:12.496]  Well, it's not only the military industry, by the way, it's very important for the public to understand this.
[00:22:12.496 --> 00:22:13.777]  I am not a hero.
[00:22:13.777 --> 00:22:15.237]  I'm not this great individual.
[00:22:15.237 --> 00:22:34.889]  I'm just a simple American who was grateful for the benefits I was given and earned in terms of the ability to serve my country and at the same time be in the only country where I could criticize my own president and still work for them and be so loyal to my country because I was willing to go online and particularly serve my military, our army generals and
[00:22:35.149 --> 00:22:36.811]  I'm not some superhero.
[00:22:36.811 --> 00:22:43.237]  I'm the same guy that your father is who's a dentist or a mechanic out there or an army lieutenant or a junior officer because they stood for something they believed in.
[00:22:58.412 --> 00:23:02.016]  I am tired of the American public being told these lies.
[00:23:02.016 --> 00:23:03.978]  I thought it would stop with 9-11.
[00:23:03.978 --> 00:23:04.999]  Now we have Obama.
[00:23:04.999 --> 00:23:06.501]  Now let's get back to the issue.
[00:23:06.501 --> 00:23:15.610]  What happens when the PSYOPs, which was poorly constructed... You were talking about where they get their CIA people and that most of the intelligence is run by private mercs.
[00:23:16.613 --> 00:23:16.953]  Correct.
[00:23:16.953 --> 00:23:23.758]  They get the intelligence people from all the military industrial complex, L3 Communications, Northrop Grumman.
[00:23:23.758 --> 00:23:32.044]  Any of these companies around the Washington Beltway will provide intelligence to you right away because they want those contracts.
[00:23:32.044 --> 00:23:35.266]  Now remember America, and particularly the Alex Jones audience,
[00:23:35.746 --> 00:23:41.370]  Supporting our national security does not mean supporting our military-industrial complex.
[00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:43.151]  It is not the same thing.
[00:23:43.151 --> 00:23:44.472]  They are out of control.
[00:23:44.472 --> 00:23:47.714]  They have been hogs that need to be slaughtered.
[00:23:47.714 --> 00:24:00.283]  I will quote one of my most favorite presidents, who unfortunately I was too young to serve, but I did always admire him, and that was General Eisenhower, who warned us when he left, beware of the military-industrial complex.
[00:24:00.283 --> 00:24:02.084]  He repeatedly said that.
[00:24:02.084 --> 00:24:04.786]  This is a great man who is exceedingly modest.
[00:24:05.206 --> 00:24:21.400]  Who is exceedingly careful of the American national security and every week he literally, Alex, would call up the Pentagon to make sure the generals didn't blow out their staff or promote things and create units that didn't exist.
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:25.643]  That's the type of generals we had and people who cared about a country.
[00:24:25.643 --> 00:24:26.424]  We don't have that now.
[00:24:26.864 --> 00:24:30.385]  What we have is Disneyland on steroids.
[00:24:30.385 --> 00:24:46.270]  And what's worse is that Disneyland is killing our heroes, our American women and men and young people who are going out to die for civilian orders that are being used and manipulated by a president who's never served our country as a
[00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:49.211]  Questionable background in many, many places.
[00:24:49.211 --> 00:24:50.992]  Forget the birthing issue.
[00:24:50.992 --> 00:24:55.675]  And half the civilians around him have all been questionable in their capability.
[00:24:55.675 --> 00:25:03.979]  And we're all recruited from a questionable predecessor, either Carter or Clinton, who himself was also a sociopath.
[00:25:03.979 --> 00:25:06.100]  So we have three sociopaths in line.
[00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:10.202]  And I use it not in a diagnostic term, but in a very simple term.
[00:25:10.202 --> 00:25:12.703]  You have Clinton, who lied and prevaricated.
[00:25:12.703 --> 00:25:15.344]  You have Bush Jr., who lied and prevaricated.
[00:25:15.344 --> 00:25:16.185]  And now you have
[00:25:16.705 --> 00:25:17.525]  Obama.
[00:25:17.525 --> 00:25:20.907]  Now, if we have three in the law, we've got a problem here, America.
[00:25:20.907 --> 00:25:24.649]  This problem isn't just with the individual, the Republican and Democrat.
[00:25:24.649 --> 00:25:27.190]  This problem is with the American people.
[00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:28.390]  We have to decide.
[00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:29.771]  This is enough.
[00:25:29.771 --> 00:25:34.173]  Whether you're Republican, Democrat, liberal or conservative, it's irrelevant.
[00:25:34.173 --> 00:25:41.656]  Sir, let me stop you because... Absolutely, because we have limited time and obviously you're going to be back with us a lot.
[00:25:41.656 --> 00:25:43.517]  The issue now, what happened is,
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:26:00.226]  If I didn't know which unit of the Special Forces, and I've worked with Special Forces over 30 years, and part of it, I was involved in development of Delta Force because in the beginning of hostage negotiation, we didn't have a comparable unit to the SAS.
[00:26:00.226 --> 00:26:11.590]  One of the concerns that I had, and I said, if I think any unit's going to be sent in there on the basis of publicity, and believe me, I have a lot of respect for the men and women who serve in the Navy and in all Special Forces,
[00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:17.893]  But particularly, I work with the military, army, the special forces, which, by the way, you have never heard anything about.
[00:26:17.893 --> 00:26:23.335]  You have never heard about any of the army men who I know, and the units that I specifically know.
[00:26:23.335 --> 00:26:30.358]  Nor will I tell you of the men and women who are in the army, and they're serving this country, and they've never had a movie about them.
[00:26:30.358 --> 00:26:32.779]  They've never had a story about them.
[00:26:32.779 --> 00:26:40.842]  Yet today, I would have sworn, and I said to Alex Jones beforehand, if I had to predict which unit was going to get the biggest publicity, and if I were
[00:26:41.002 --> 00:26:48.566]  Admiral Mullen, who's concerned about this publicity and the publicity of the Navy because they have no goal whatsoever right now.
[00:26:48.566 --> 00:26:51.828]  Strategically, I would have said they would have used a SEAL Navy team.
[00:26:51.828 --> 00:26:52.848]  Now, think about it.
[00:26:52.848 --> 00:26:58.071]  You use a SEAL Navy team on the ground from Pakistan to Pakistan?
[00:26:58.071 --> 00:26:59.172]  It makes no sense.
[00:26:59.172 --> 00:27:06.736]  And then to go on the news and to say that we are so great, but we are so secret, it is an inherent contradiction.
[00:27:06.736 --> 00:27:08.477]  When you're secret, you are secret.
[00:27:08.837 --> 00:27:10.618]  There's a reason why I don't have a picture.
[00:27:10.618 --> 00:27:12.299]  Because I'm not that good-looking.
[00:27:12.299 --> 00:27:16.222]  There's a reason why I really don't care about what people think about it.
[00:27:16.222 --> 00:27:19.184]  Because I want to do my everyday life in America.
[00:27:19.184 --> 00:27:21.345]  I don't need to promote my narcissism.
[00:27:21.345 --> 00:27:24.107]  I don't need to promote who I am or what I am.
[00:27:24.107 --> 00:27:27.430]  It's already difficult to pronounce my last name, Pachenik.
[00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:34.194]  And by the way, that's been my secret to success overseas because nobody could spell Pachenik, including Noriega.
[00:27:34.194 --> 00:27:36.275]  But let's go back to the Navy SEALs.
[00:27:36.275 --> 00:27:38.357]  They really have to question what they did
[00:27:38.857 --> 00:27:41.781]  Well, let me stop you, doctor.
[00:27:41.781 --> 00:27:43.543]  Doctor, there's been some major breaking news.
[00:27:43.543 --> 00:27:44.464]  Dr. Pachanik, are you there?
[00:27:44.464 --> 00:27:46.547]  Okay, great.
[00:27:46.547 --> 00:27:56.499]  Obviously, this morning they came out and said his daughter, who they have at a military base in Pakistan, who was left there, and he has all these wives, all these concubines, all this made-up
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:57.480]  Cut out.
[00:28:16.082 --> 00:28:16.843]  I don't know.
[00:28:33.359 --> 00:28:43.811]  That's why they use that team so that other SEALs are ignorant and can never discover that it didn't happen.
[00:28:43.811 --> 00:28:48.857]  And you're breaking down what teams you think are involved, what happened.
[00:28:48.857 --> 00:28:50.418]  Obviously it's theater.
[00:28:50.418 --> 00:28:52.360]  He's been dead for nine plus years, ten years.
[00:29:01.511 --> 00:29:05.515]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:29:05.515 --> 00:29:08.758]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:29:08.758 --> 00:29:13.562]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:29:13.562 --> 00:29:19.968]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:29:19.968 --> 00:29:22.211]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:29:22.731 --> 00:29:23.031]  Tim Geithner?
[00:29:23.031 --> 00:29:23.551]  Bernanke?
[00:29:23.551 --> 00:29:24.212]  They're arsonists!
[00:29:24.212 --> 00:29:25.492]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:29:25.492 --> 00:29:27.734]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:29:41.641 --> 00:29:46.025]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[00:29:46.025 --> 00:29:48.928]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:29:48.928 --> 00:29:58.036]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:30:00.049 --> 00:30:04.591]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:30:04.591 --> 00:30:05.512]  Number 1.
[00:30:05.512 --> 00:30:08.934]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:08.934 --> 00:30:09.794]  Number 2.
[00:30:09.794 --> 00:30:14.677]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:14.677 --> 00:30:15.437]  It's true.
[00:30:15.437 --> 00:30:20.300]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:21.120]  Number 3.
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:24.702]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:24.702 --> 00:30:28.404]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:30:28.604 --> 00:30:29.404]  Number 4.
[00:30:29.404 --> 00:30:32.165]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:30:32.165 --> 00:30:35.846]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:35.846 --> 00:30:36.646]  Number 5.
[00:30:36.646 --> 00:30:40.787]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:30:40.787 --> 00:30:45.829]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:30:45.829 --> 00:30:50.010]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:30:59.933 --> 00:31:01.093]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:31:01.093 --> 00:31:08.034]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:31:08.034 --> 00:31:10.595]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:31:10.595 --> 00:31:15.956]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:31:15.956 --> 00:31:18.997]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:31:18.997 --> 00:31:21.057]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:31:21.317 --> 00:31:27.562]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:31:27.562 --> 00:31:30.944]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:31:30.944 --> 00:31:36.729]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:31:36.729 --> 00:31:38.370]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:39.671]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:31:39.671 --> 00:31:42.353]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:31:42.353 --> 00:31:46.576]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:31:46.576 --> 00:31:48.297]  You can find the video at www.
[00:31:56.299 --> 00:32:06.862]  Over the last year, Alex has told you about and many of you have experienced emergencies and disasters in unprecedented numbers.
[00:32:06.862 --> 00:32:09.502]  People have had to literally run for their lives.
[00:32:09.502 --> 00:32:11.943]  Folks, this is Steve Schenck with eFoods Direct.
[00:32:11.943 --> 00:32:16.324]  I'm not here to scare you, but when disaster strikes, you won't have time to think.
[00:32:16.324 --> 00:32:17.784]  You must act automatically.
[00:32:18.024 --> 00:32:21.527]  What does a pilot do when the helicopter engine fails in flight?
[00:32:21.527 --> 00:32:24.309]  No time to think, just act automatically.
[00:32:24.309 --> 00:32:32.656]  When the alert is broadcast, the alarm sounds, or the knock comes on your door, you'll need to be ready to act without thinking of what to do or what you need.
[00:32:32.656 --> 00:32:35.438]  You need a 5-Day Extreme Emergency Kit.
[00:32:35.698 --> 00:32:45.385]  With serious supplies and real food to secure two adults for five days, this powerful $300 Extreme Emergency Kit is free with an order of at least $995 from eFoodsDirect.

[00:32:47.467 --> 00:32:49.928]  That's eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex.
[00:32:49.928 --> 00:32:49.968]  800-409-5633.
[00:33:01.061 --> 00:33:04.651]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[00:33:04.651 --> 00:33:07.859]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:33:47.868 --> 00:33:57.733]  Dr. Steve Pachenek is our guest, and he's breaking down as a psyops expert who really wrote the book on much of the modern system, that this is completely phony.
[00:33:57.733 --> 00:33:59.715]  And I know that he just laughs at it.
[00:33:59.715 --> 00:34:04.497]  He's on record nine years ago, here, saying Ben Lava's eyes would be rolled out.
[00:34:04.497 --> 00:34:08.019]  Then the former Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, came out and said, indeed, that was true.
[00:34:08.019 --> 00:34:11.081]  Theresa Hines Carey, Walter Cronkite, big insider.
[00:34:12.341 --> 00:34:13.402]  And people get confused.
[00:34:13.402 --> 00:34:14.923]  They say, well, this is a new administration.
[00:34:14.923 --> 00:34:17.125]  Why would Bush let him do that later?
[00:34:17.125 --> 00:34:20.587]  A, no one would believe it because it was exposed beforehand.
[00:34:20.587 --> 00:34:36.378]  B, they wanted to keep that boogeyman alive a while, now that he's not useful anymore, by killing him in the fairyland, in the land of Nod or the land that Tinkerbell lives in.
[00:34:36.378 --> 00:34:37.279]  By doing that,
[00:34:39.093 --> 00:34:44.737]  Now they revive him and say, oh my gosh, look, the terrorists are now everywhere.
[00:34:44.737 --> 00:34:46.258]  They're going to be attacking us.
[00:34:46.258 --> 00:34:50.761]  We've got to set up TSA-trained checkpoints in all malls, grocery stores.
[00:34:50.761 --> 00:34:52.402]  That's CBS News today.
[00:34:52.402 --> 00:34:55.044]  We've got to take all your rights and have more wars.
[00:34:55.044 --> 00:34:58.527]  You've got to do whatever we tell you because bin Laden is dead.
[00:34:58.527 --> 00:35:00.988]  And of course, we wrote about this yesterday.
[00:35:00.988 --> 00:35:01.929]  Forget Pakistan.
[00:35:01.929 --> 00:35:04.711]  You asked me about bin Laden's location all along.
[00:35:05.271 --> 00:35:11.075]  If you believe the official story and the Pakistanis are now saying nine months ago, they said something was going on in that compound.
[00:35:11.075 --> 00:35:17.939]  But again, that's all just adding credence to the official story and all these debates about did he have a gun?
[00:35:17.939 --> 00:35:19.199]  Did he use his wife?
[00:35:19.199 --> 00:35:20.660]  Was he shot at the compound?
[00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:22.221]  Did they execute him later?
[00:35:22.221 --> 00:35:33.608]  That's all to create inconsistencies in the fake narrative because somehow it lends credibility to it because then people say, well, they did kill him, but we're being lied to about exactly how.
[00:35:34.088 --> 00:35:34.288]  I think?
[00:35:52.006 --> 00:35:52.347]  I don't
[00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:22.379]  But obviously, through my contacts, there are a whole bunch of other squadrons with other jobs, not just anti-terror, the surveillance groups, the plainclothes groups.
[00:36:22.379 --> 00:36:26.384]  I mean, there's all sorts of groups way above that, but you can't get into that.
[00:36:26.384 --> 00:36:34.432]  But obviously, they use the politicized group with this phantom SEAL Team 6, so the other SEALs can't even find out it's a fraud.
[00:36:34.432 --> 00:36:35.013]  Please continue.
[00:36:36.341 --> 00:36:49.413]  The real issue, again, in the narrative that you want to create in PSYOPs, when you create a war like 9-11, which is deception, denial, false flag, and stand down that all your people know about, you need to have a bad guy.
[00:36:49.413 --> 00:36:52.996]  So the bad guy was suddenly Saddam Osama Bin Laden.
[00:36:52.996 --> 00:36:57.300]  But in this narrative, because Bush, Cheney, Wolfowitz, and the U.S.
[00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:01.184]  and the Neocons were not very bright in understanding even PSYOPs for war,
[00:37:02.185 --> 00:37:05.649]  They created two bad guys, Saddam Hussein and Osama Bin Laden.
[00:37:05.649 --> 00:37:11.156]  And a lot of us got confused because Osama Bin Laden, Saddam Hussein has never been a Muslim.
[00:37:11.156 --> 00:37:13.258]  He was basically a Baptist.
[00:37:13.258 --> 00:37:15.221]  He hated Osama Bin Laden.
[00:37:15.221 --> 00:37:18.505]  And basically we had two wars going on with two
[00:37:19.245 --> 00:37:21.546]  Unspecified targets.
[00:37:21.546 --> 00:37:26.487]  We went into two countries without any clear exposition of what the reasons were.
[00:37:26.487 --> 00:37:31.509]  So we had this incredible science that made no sense, no internal consistency.
[00:37:31.509 --> 00:37:37.811]  When people in the intelligence community came back to Bush and said, this is not true, we don't have weapons of mass destruction.
[00:37:37.811 --> 00:37:45.153]  Still the only fable that was out there to sustain this myth of the war, of why we were fighting terrorists that didn't exist.
[00:37:45.513 --> 00:38:00.965]  And we had created under the Carter administration and subsequently in the Bush's administration, we had to have this Samson Polo, Osama Bin Laden, who was somehow scurrying about in the Athenian continent, Tora Bora, with a renal dialysis machine.
[00:38:00.965 --> 00:38:05.929]  And I said 10 years ago on Alex Jones' show, this is nonsense.
[00:38:05.929 --> 00:38:07.650]  This science is so pathetic.
[00:38:08.170 --> 00:38:10.251]  Because he has Marfan syndrome.
[00:38:10.251 --> 00:38:14.754]  He died already six months after the 9-11 attack.
[00:38:14.754 --> 00:38:20.118]  He was, has, his number two man instead of the Taliban, is a physician.
[00:38:20.118 --> 00:38:27.943]  And by the way, from a tactical point of view and a strategic point of view, his death means absolutely nothing in the real world of intelligence.
[00:38:27.943 --> 00:38:28.503]  Let me stop you!
[00:38:28.503 --> 00:38:34.567]  The point is that Obama is trying to resurrect his career and trying to get re-elected and it means that
[00:38:34.967 --> 00:38:40.490]  Panetta wants to have credibility that he did something in the CIA when, in fact, he was a disaster to the CIA.
[00:38:40.490 --> 00:38:44.512]  He killed more civilians in Pakistan than any terrorist did.
[00:38:44.512 --> 00:38:47.134]  He created more drone attacks than any terrorist.
[00:38:47.134 --> 00:38:51.496]  We had more CIA operatives die because of his faulty understanding.
[00:38:51.496 --> 00:39:00.141]  And we converted an entire CIA, which is intelligence or human-oriented, into special forces and into a killing unit.
[00:39:00.601 --> 00:39:11.034]  Now, this does not involve the generals Petraeus and our military men who've done a formidable job, but they are also at the behest of civilians who've never been to war.
[00:39:11.034 --> 00:39:17.763]  So when the President of the United States, Obama, said, without any experience, after picking up the Nobel Peace Prize, which was absurd,
[00:39:18.363 --> 00:39:23.726]  And then went to war the next day in Afghanistan after giving this peace talk to the Muslims saying we're all brothers.
[00:39:23.726 --> 00:39:26.368]  You could see the inconsistency and the lies.
[00:39:26.368 --> 00:39:29.670]  And now this politicized drama, which makes no sense.
[00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:31.911]  All the inconsistencies are unwinding.
[00:39:31.911 --> 00:39:36.634]  But we needed Osama bin Laden, or the story was needed, in order to get the bad man.
[00:39:36.634 --> 00:39:44.078]  The reason he's now discovered, and ostensibly, this attack on a mortuary, which I've never, you know, this is the most absurd story I've ever heard,
[00:39:44.947 --> 00:39:56.477]  Legitimizes, number one, the fact that this entire system of intelligence, which, by the way, Americans have to understand, there are over 850,000 contractors.
[00:39:56.477 --> 00:39:59.540]  Contractors with top secret clearances.
[00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:01.982]  Now that is the most absurd thing I have ever heard.
[00:40:01.982 --> 00:40:03.263]  You have a stake in the fairy tale.
[00:40:03.263 --> 00:40:06.706]  Let me add something because you are a medical doctor.
[00:40:08.823 --> 00:40:10.765]  Let's break this down.
[00:40:10.765 --> 00:40:19.052]  Now, from my own layman research, total renal failure, kidney failure for laymen out there, the disease he had.
[00:40:19.052 --> 00:40:29.021]  I went online to a whole bunch of mainline medical sites last night and on the outside they were saying maybe you can live five, six years.
[00:40:29.882 --> 00:40:33.604]  Uh, once you're in this position, but if you have this disease, even less.
[00:40:33.604 --> 00:40:40.967]  So, then I went and pulled up old articles from even the mid-90s saying he had it then and that it was on record.
[00:40:40.967 --> 00:40:42.868]  You've seen a CIA file.
[00:40:42.868 --> 00:40:49.291]  So how can a guy that has something that kills you in six years, correct me if I'm wrong, how can he be alive 16 years later?
[00:40:51.084 --> 00:40:51.665]  We can.
[00:40:51.665 --> 00:41:00.076]  That's why I said on your show even two and nine years ago that Dr. Julie, one of the physicians of the CIA, went to the American hospital in Dubai.
[00:41:00.076 --> 00:41:03.080]  He was already dying under the Clinton administration.
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:05.764]  So you have Clinton implicated, who is another prevaricator.
[00:41:07.804 --> 00:41:12.945]  And that was used subsequently in 9-11 because they knew his life was limited.
[00:41:12.945 --> 00:41:13.966]  That was it.
[00:41:13.966 --> 00:41:14.846]  He was to die.
[00:41:14.846 --> 00:41:20.727]  So how do you best use a man's imminent death in a psychological warfare routine?
[00:41:20.727 --> 00:41:22.388]  Well, you make him the bad guy.
[00:41:22.388 --> 00:41:26.268]  So you make him the bad guy and then you don't find him for 10 years.
[00:41:26.268 --> 00:41:29.189]  Now, that is so absurd in terms of credibility.
[00:41:29.449 --> 00:41:35.734]  And by the way, sir, by the way, you didn't even know that CBS News had reported that the CIA did go to the American hospital.
[00:41:35.734 --> 00:41:37.896]  Le Figaro, the French, that's been confirmed.
[00:41:37.896 --> 00:41:39.777]  No, I knew this way before.
[00:41:39.777 --> 00:41:40.558]  No, no, no, no.
[00:41:40.558 --> 00:41:41.078]  I understand.
[00:41:41.078 --> 00:41:41.979]  I understand.
[00:41:41.979 --> 00:41:45.142]  And well, no, you said it on the show years ago.
[00:41:45.142 --> 00:41:48.725]  It didn't come out until after, but they probably got it from you and then went and did research.
[00:41:48.725 --> 00:41:50.006]  But the issue here is
[00:41:50.586 --> 00:41:51.868]  That they know full well.
[00:41:51.868 --> 00:41:55.992]  Now his family builds most of the military bases in the Middle East.
[00:41:55.992 --> 00:41:58.315]  They did the air conditioning for Mecca.
[00:41:58.315 --> 00:42:01.479]  They're one of the richest families in Saudi Arabia.
[00:42:01.479 --> 00:42:04.262]  His kids are all going to Oxford and the rest of it.
[00:42:10.169 --> 00:42:14.152]  Now, his daughter, but we're not seeing her, pops up and says it's all true.
[00:42:14.152 --> 00:42:18.695]  This family, from my study, correct me if I'm wrong, goes back to British intelligence.
[00:42:18.695 --> 00:42:28.001]  They didn't just send bin Laden in to be the money man for the Mujahideen that you met while you were there running some of the military operations because he fell off an Apple truck.
[00:42:28.001 --> 00:42:34.766]  Now, my intel is they made the deal with him and his family at the time to let him play the part of the bad guy.
[00:42:34.766 --> 00:42:37.567]  And since then, they've been given even bigger U.S.
[00:42:37.567 --> 00:42:39.309]  and British contracts as the payoff.
[00:42:40.450 --> 00:42:41.811]  We're good to go.
[00:43:02.003 --> 00:43:04.486]  And you're subject to other police action.
[00:43:04.486 --> 00:43:05.747]  Tyranny is here.
[00:43:05.747 --> 00:43:09.291]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:43:09.291 --> 00:43:11.913]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:43:11.913 --> 00:43:17.779]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:43:17.779 --> 00:43:24.026]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:43:24.426 --> 00:43:30.388]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:43:30.388 --> 00:43:34.589]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:43:34.589 --> 00:43:38.870]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:44.832]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:43:44.832 --> 00:43:48.373]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:43:48.373 --> 00:43:50.354]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:43:50.354 --> 00:43:50.794]  It's here.

[00:44:59.926 --> 00:45:04.469]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:45:04.469 --> 00:45:05.390]  Number 1.
[00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:08.813]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:45:08.813 --> 00:45:09.673]  Number 2.
[00:45:09.673 --> 00:45:14.557]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:45:14.557 --> 00:45:15.297]  It's true.
[00:45:15.297 --> 00:45:20.181]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:45:20.181 --> 00:45:21.002]  Number 3.
[00:45:21.002 --> 00:45:24.584]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:45:24.584 --> 00:45:28.287]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:45:28.487 --> 00:45:29.287]  Number 4.
[00:45:29.287 --> 00:45:32.048]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:45:32.048 --> 00:45:35.730]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:45:35.730 --> 00:45:36.510]  Number 5.
[00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:40.672]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:45:40.672 --> 00:45:45.714]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:46:02.543 --> 00:46:07.848]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:46:07.848 --> 00:46:09.369]  Saving means to make money.

[00:46:26.422 --> 00:46:34.427]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:46:34.427 --> 00:46:39.671]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:04.732]  Direct from Austin.
[00:47:04.732 --> 00:47:07.935]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:47:17.122 --> 00:47:32.221]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[00:47:32.221 --> 00:47:34.844]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:37.965 --> 00:47:42.788]  Let me tell you one principle of counter-terrorism and psychological warfare.
[00:47:42.788 --> 00:47:47.532]  Any terrorist that has been apprehended, for the most part, has a rule of thumb.
[00:47:47.532 --> 00:47:58.719]  For example, Carlos not only served intelligence of the Soviets, he served intelligence for the Mossad, for the French, who, of course, questionably called him BNP.
[00:47:58.719 --> 00:48:07.345]  So, within this game of counter-terrorism, which is really a game, a very sick game, we create what is called, under Kissinger, strategic tension.
[00:48:07.845 --> 00:48:18.633]  We create strategic tensions so we have a legitimate use, a good reason to go into a country to either invade, suppress, or extract whatever mineral rights.
[00:48:18.633 --> 00:48:19.994]  Now let me give you an understanding.
[00:48:19.994 --> 00:48:21.535]  Let me say it very clearly.
[00:48:21.535 --> 00:48:24.618]  Osama bin Laden was on more than one payroll.
[00:48:24.618 --> 00:48:30.722]  He was not only in the CIA payroll, British payroll, but guess whose other payroll he was on, Alex Jones?
[00:48:30.722 --> 00:48:31.503]  The Israelis.
[00:48:31.503 --> 00:48:32.463]  The Wildcats.
[00:48:32.463 --> 00:48:32.924]  You got it.
[00:48:33.817 --> 00:48:49.097]  And he had relationships with Jews in the Middle East and the diamond business and Israel will go absolutely nuts, but the New York Times article years ago even reported how a lot of his own money came out of the Jewish diamond dealers in Tel Aviv.
[00:48:49.617 --> 00:49:08.227]  And his mother, Yemeni, usually would probably be Jewish, but I don't want to get into this entire issue other than the fact that people have to understand, when I went after Noriega, which also cost my life because he hunted me down, accused me of being an assassin, whether it's right or wrong, let's not worry about that, but he served
[00:49:08.847 --> 00:49:14.792]  Our intelligence, he served Latin American intelligence, he served Cuban intelligence, he served many intelligence.
[00:49:14.792 --> 00:49:22.938]  For the same reason when we went after Saddam Hussein, by the way I do have to correct you, Saddam Hussein was not executed with all due respect Alex Jones.
[00:49:22.938 --> 00:49:26.941]  We never execute a leader of a country and particularly with Bush Jr.
[00:49:26.941 --> 00:49:29.403]  who's a liar and a coward by the way.
[00:49:29.403 --> 00:49:30.985]  So you're saying that's all fake too?
[00:49:32.385 --> 00:49:33.446]  He was not executed.
[00:49:33.446 --> 00:49:41.752]  What you saw in effect was a picture of a so-called execution through a camera of somebody's little camera.
[00:49:41.752 --> 00:49:44.655]  But he is probably somewhere in Central Asia.
[00:49:44.655 --> 00:49:45.755]  And if Bush Jr.
[00:49:45.755 --> 00:49:52.721]  can go in front of a federal court, and if he can swear that without holding Cheney's hands the same way he did at the mission, I will be surprised.
[00:49:52.721 --> 00:49:56.123]  Well, sir, that's like the old Kings rule where kings don't kill kings.
[00:49:56.123 --> 00:50:00.667]  That's why twice... That's exactly... That's why twice with Napoleon they put him on islands.
[00:50:01.531 --> 00:50:02.231]  Exactly.
[00:50:02.231 --> 00:50:02.912]  Idi Amin.
[00:50:02.912 --> 00:50:04.092]  I worked against Idi Amin.
[00:50:04.092 --> 00:50:06.233]  He killed 187,000 people.
[00:50:06.233 --> 00:50:06.913]  We didn't kill him.
[00:50:06.913 --> 00:50:08.154]  We put him in Saudi Arabia.
[00:50:08.154 --> 00:50:09.334]  He was playing poetry.
[00:50:09.334 --> 00:50:10.534]  He was writing poetry.
[00:50:10.534 --> 00:50:12.815]  He was playing golf.
[00:50:12.815 --> 00:50:14.296]  Noriega was never killed.
[00:50:14.296 --> 00:50:15.596]  He was sent off to France.
[00:50:15.596 --> 00:50:17.577]  He has a chateau in France.
[00:50:17.577 --> 00:50:19.958]  It goes on and on and on.
[00:50:19.958 --> 00:50:21.719]  Osama Bin Laden was already dead.
[00:50:21.719 --> 00:50:22.319]  We used him.
[00:50:22.999 --> 00:50:40.644]  All of these so-called villains are used for national security purposes and the vehicle is always a psychological operation to mobilize the American public through the most cynical of all statements, national security, freedom of speech, and in fact what happens is their suppression.
[00:50:40.644 --> 00:50:49.706]  So the inherent paradox of what our country does to ourselves will come back to bite the government repeatedly because the American government will not tolerate it.
[00:50:50.246 --> 00:50:55.490]  Doctor, this is too incredible, and the time we've got only about 35 minutes with you.
[00:50:55.490 --> 00:51:00.414]  I don't want to bump Lord Mocton who's popping in, but I'm getting really tempted to do it here in a minute.
[00:51:00.414 --> 00:51:00.755]  Okay.
[00:51:00.755 --> 00:51:02.016]  But no, no, no, no.
[00:51:02.016 --> 00:51:04.057]  Stay there, sir, because... I am here.
[00:51:04.057 --> 00:51:04.458]  I am.
[00:51:04.458 --> 00:51:05.258]  But let's go back.
[00:51:05.258 --> 00:51:12.384]  Let's go back here, because every time you mention something, it opens a whole data mine in my own brain up.
[00:51:12.384 --> 00:51:13.725]  Yes.
[00:51:13.725 --> 00:51:19.450]  The four Al-Qaeda leaders... He must have been restless at school, Alex.
[00:51:20.374 --> 00:51:28.920]  I was restless, but every time you mention a point, then I can see all the data that's public, not to mention all the data, inside data you have, but it's just all confirmed.
[00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:49.634]  When I was on RT, international TV, a few days ago, they showed the four top Al-Qaeda people, and three of them, Gadhan, Al-Awlaki, and one other, they admit, all born in the US, and then I know their ledgers, Amir al-Awlaki, Fox News admits, secretly at the Pentagon, two months after 9-11, dining with the Secretary of the Army, he runs.
[00:51:50.514 --> 00:51:58.102]  The Fort Hood, Patsy Attacks, the Underwear Bomber, the Times Square, the Shoe Bomber, they get the drugged McCollum on the plane.
[00:51:58.102 --> 00:52:00.264]  I mean, this is all admitted!
[00:52:00.264 --> 00:52:05.449]  And the State Department... I mean, what's crazy is... But let me just add this final point.
[00:52:08.117 --> 00:52:08.958]  But here's my point.
[00:52:08.958 --> 00:52:15.345]  Adam Gadon is the grandson of the former head of the ADL who was arrested for beating up Arabs outside Mosque.
[00:52:15.345 --> 00:52:16.686]  He hated him so much.
[00:52:16.686 --> 00:52:20.750]  And the way he gets them is by dressing up in that clown suit with the beard.
[00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:25.574]  Here is this ADL grandson uploading with the Intel Center.
[00:52:26.355 --> 00:52:32.138]  In the same Al Qaeda logo, their logo, and Wired Magazine confirmed they'd made the video!
[00:52:32.138 --> 00:52:35.399]  I mean, you're bringing up bin Laden working for Israel.
[00:52:35.399 --> 00:52:37.640]  I don't think people get what you're saying here.
[00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:39.421]  They have to... I'm not saying he's working.
[00:52:39.421 --> 00:52:44.483]  I'm saying that basically he had been funded by, you know, a diamond dealer.
[00:52:44.483 --> 00:52:45.784]  That was in the New York Times.
[00:52:46.284 --> 00:52:50.988]  And I'm sure he worked for many other intelligence services, including the Brits and others.
[00:52:50.988 --> 00:53:06.400]  You know, because in that game, and this is speculation on that part, in that game of counterterrorism, which unfortunately is the game, it is always service of multiple masters in order to justify what we have, what they do, what national governments do.
[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:09.643]  But Ben Laden was always dealing in the diamond business.
[00:53:09.643 --> 00:53:10.984]  I believe his mother was Jewish.
[00:53:10.984 --> 00:53:11.685]  She's Yemeni.
[00:53:12.585 --> 00:53:15.906]  And, you know, the Bin Laden family is still part of the Carlisle Group.
[00:53:15.906 --> 00:53:18.546]  Take a look if they haven't been on it or if they're still part of it.
[00:53:18.546 --> 00:53:19.347]  You can look it up.
[00:53:19.347 --> 00:53:19.727]  No, sir.
[00:53:19.727 --> 00:53:23.488]  London Guardian headline, September 11th, 2001.
[00:53:23.488 --> 00:53:35.030]  It had already, uh, September 12th, that he, that, that all these top brass and Bush people were meeting at the Carlisle Group meeting with the Bin Ladens there that day.
[00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:35.910]  That's what I mean.
[00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:38.371]  There's all, there's all these insane connections.
[00:53:39.565 --> 00:53:40.006]  That's correct.
[00:53:40.006 --> 00:53:41.349]  It's all connections.
[00:53:41.349 --> 00:53:48.823]  So basically the question is how do you break these connections and how does the American public stop this nonsensical dangers?
[00:53:49.428 --> 00:53:52.149]  It's a cynical disruption, as you call it.
[00:53:52.149 --> 00:54:03.394]  It's destroying the fibers of our country, and the answer is you have to get out on the streets and start insisting on freedom of speech, insisting that you have to organize.
[00:54:03.394 --> 00:54:05.715]  The American public is not stupid.
[00:54:05.715 --> 00:54:10.957]  They don't need to have their homework to protect the country, and they have to have a man of truth.
[00:54:11.577 --> 00:54:15.282]  And they have to force the legislators, most of whom are cowardly.
[00:54:15.282 --> 00:54:21.649]  Because, whether you're a Republican or a Democrat, remember the dynamics of a legislator is the panderer.
[00:54:21.649 --> 00:54:26.534]  He first says to you very nicely, oh please vote for me, please vote for me, this is what I can do.
[00:54:26.534 --> 00:54:31.560]  Well, it's like saying a physician like me, if I weren't a medical student, I'd go up to you, Alex, and I'd say, listen,
[00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:38.324]  I want you to pay for the fact that I'm going to be a doctor, but I'm not a doctor right now, but I promise you I'm going to be a doctor.
[00:54:38.324 --> 00:54:39.785]  You're going to say, what are you, crazy?
[00:54:39.785 --> 00:54:42.006]  You haven't shown anything that you can do to be a doctor.
[00:54:42.006 --> 00:54:43.387]  Well, that's what Obama did.
[00:54:43.387 --> 00:54:45.989]  He said, look, I can run this country, but I've never run anything.
[00:54:45.989 --> 00:54:47.409]  Dr. Puccini, we've got a break.
[00:54:47.409 --> 00:54:48.270]  We've got a break.
[00:54:48.270 --> 00:54:52.913]  And again, I hate to interrupt because everything you're saying is so important, but then I've got...
[00:54:54.373 --> 00:54:58.834]  All of these other questions I want to bring up to you and I want to get into the solutions.
[00:54:58.834 --> 00:55:00.295]  I want to spend a lot of time on that.
[00:55:00.295 --> 00:55:02.815]  There's also a lot of breaking news.
[00:55:02.815 --> 00:55:17.139]  CBS News is confirming the president has now given an interview that will be played later this week that they are not going to release the photos and they say Obama said the risk of releasing outweighed the benefits.
[00:55:17.919 --> 00:55:18.239]  I don't
[00:55:36.954 --> 00:55:37.515]  I don't think so.
[00:56:02.864 --> 00:56:03.204]  Let's get
[00:56:25.219 --> 00:56:36.492]  Well, you know, the beauty of life is that there are people who are trying to do nasty things.
[00:56:36.492 --> 00:56:43.380]  And whether we call a conspiracy theorist or not, or he says it's silliness, that doesn't mitigate the fact that there's truth.
[00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:56.567]  And a man who is not able to tell the truth or come to terms with the truth, then uses these very flippant words like conspiracy theorists, silly people, birthists, or truists.
[00:56:56.567 --> 00:57:03.891]  These are code words in order to make sure that you're put into a corner where you can't say anything and you're categorized.
[00:57:03.891 --> 00:57:07.653]  That's a very easy way to delegitimize you in psychological warfare.
[00:57:07.653 --> 00:57:10.355]  But unfortunately, the president really is not very smart.
[00:57:10.795 --> 00:57:15.960]  Contrary to his own self-esteem, and they can listen to this at the White House, he's not very bright.
[00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:27.892]  And I'm saying that because he never really had an education in psychology, never really had an education in the real world how it works, other than the political world of corruption, deception, denial, and lie.
[00:57:27.892 --> 00:57:30.414]  But he doesn't really know how to effectively use it.
[00:57:30.414 --> 00:57:32.877]  More importantly, neither do anybody around him.
[00:57:33.117 --> 00:57:48.762]  That's why the storyline and this atrocity and ridiculousness, if you want to talk about the president's own words, silliness, of the body of Osama Bin Laden that's been dead for nine years but he can't show you a picture of it, is so absurd it flashes back.
[00:57:48.762 --> 00:57:50.022]  It's what we call a blowback.
[00:57:51.508 --> 00:57:55.509]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:57:55.509 --> 00:57:58.770]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:57:58.770 --> 00:58:03.551]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:58:03.551 --> 00:58:09.953]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:58:09.953 --> 00:58:12.194]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:58:12.734 --> 00:58:13.034]  Tim Geithner?
[00:58:13.034 --> 00:58:13.554]  Bernanke?
[00:58:13.554 --> 00:58:14.215]  They're arsonists!
[00:58:14.215 --> 00:58:15.315]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:58:15.315 --> 00:58:17.736]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:58:31.641 --> 00:58:36.004]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[00:58:36.004 --> 00:58:38.926]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:58:38.926 --> 00:58:48.031]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:58:50.382 --> 00:58:57.329]  Over the last year, Alex has told you about and many of you have experienced emergencies and disasters in unprecedented numbers.
[00:58:57.329 --> 00:58:59.971]  People have had to literally run for their lives.
[00:58:59.971 --> 00:59:02.413]  Folks, this is Steve Schenck with Ifoots Direct.
[00:59:02.413 --> 00:59:06.797]  I'm not here to scare you, but when disaster strikes, you won't have time to think.
[00:59:06.797 --> 00:59:08.279]  You must act automatically.
[00:59:08.499 --> 00:59:12.002]  What does a pilot do when the helicopter engine fails in flight?
[00:59:12.002 --> 00:59:14.765]  No time to think, just act automatically.
[00:59:14.765 --> 00:59:23.132]  When the alert is broadcast, the alarm sounds, or the knock comes on your door, you'll need to be ready to act without thinking of what to do or what you need.
[00:59:23.132 --> 00:59:25.915]  You need a 5-Day Extreme Emergency Kit.
[00:59:26.155 --> 00:59:35.844]  With serious supplies and real food to secure two adults for five days, this powerful $300 Extreme Emergency Kit is free with an order of at least $995 from eFoodsDirect.
[00:59:35.844 --> 00:59:37.946]  Go to eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex or call 800-409-5633.
[00:59:37.946 --> 00:59:40.408]  That's eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex.
[00:59:40.408 --> 00:59:40.448]  800-409-5633.
[00:59:51.246 --> 00:59:54.828]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[00:59:54.828 --> 01:00:02.173]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:00:02.173 --> 01:00:04.554]  You are obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth.
[01:00:04.554 --> 01:00:05.475]  A lie!
[01:00:05.475 --> 01:00:07.456]  No man is obsolete!
[01:00:07.456 --> 01:00:09.337]  You have no function, Mr. Wordsworth.
[01:00:09.337 --> 01:00:12.579]  You're an anachronism, like a ghost from another time!
[01:00:12.579 --> 01:00:18.042]  I am nothing more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages!
[01:00:18.042 --> 01:00:20.784]  You're a bug, Mr. Wordsworth, a crawling insect.
[01:00:21.464 --> 01:00:25.850]  An ugly, misformed little creature who has no purpose here, no meaning!
[01:00:25.850 --> 01:00:27.391]  I am a human being!
[01:00:27.391 --> 01:00:35.120]  Words, Mr. Wordsworth, that have no substance and no dimension, like air, like the wind!
[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:36.282]  I don't care!
[01:00:36.282 --> 01:00:37.844]  I tell you, I don't care!
[01:00:37.844 --> 01:00:38.885]  I'm a human being!
[01:00:38.885 --> 01:00:39.385]  I exist!
[01:00:40.464 --> 01:00:46.571]  And if I speak one thought aloud, that thought lives, even after I'm shoveled into my grave!
[01:00:46.571 --> 01:00:49.734]  Delusions, Mr. Wordsworth!
[01:00:49.734 --> 01:00:57.422]  Delusions that you inject into your veins to make you think you have a strength, when you have no strength at all!
[01:00:57.422 --> 01:01:02.788]  You have nothing but spindly limbs and a dream, and the state has no use for your kind!
[01:01:04.477 --> 01:01:08.562]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:01:08.562 --> 01:01:10.304]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:32.042]  We know Al-Qaeda was created and controlled by the criminal element that runs our government and other governments.
[01:01:32.042 --> 01:01:34.383]  We know they use them as a pretext to launch wars.
[01:01:34.383 --> 01:01:45.568]  We know they use them as a pretext to have domestic police take crackdowns and to make what government and corporations do secret from us, we the people, while they rob us through government control that's setting up monopolies for them.
[01:01:46.539 --> 01:01:54.124]  But clearly, we have said that as the economy implodes, as they launch these new wars, that they would then bring in state terror.
[01:01:54.124 --> 01:01:58.686]  And this death of Bin Laden is a psychological resurrection of him.
[01:01:58.686 --> 01:02:08.732]  Then they introduce the four new Bin Ladens, three of which are on record trained in the U.S., two of which, on record, absolutely work for the federal government at the highest levels of black ops.
[01:02:08.732 --> 01:02:10.853]  And they're so arrogant, it's just admitted everywhere.
[01:02:10.853 --> 01:02:13.195]  But still, it's not kosher to point that out.
[01:02:13.895 --> 01:02:16.457]  So they're rolling them out just like they did pre-9-11.
[01:02:16.457 --> 01:02:18.579]  I'm seeing the exact same preconditioning.
[01:02:18.579 --> 01:02:23.482]  So, maximum, maximum, total red alert.
[01:02:23.482 --> 01:02:35.110]  Everyone, and in fact I'm going to ask Aaron Dykes to do this next hour, we need to get the White House number, the Congress number, the switchboard, launch Operation Expose the Government Terrorist Part 2.
[01:02:35.110 --> 01:02:39.473]  I haven't done this in 10 years, since July of 2000.
[01:02:43.524 --> 01:02:44.905]  Total alert, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:02:44.905 --> 01:02:45.886]  You must call them.
[01:02:45.886 --> 01:02:56.774]  We need to get an article out today or tomorrow by one of the great researchers there pointing all of this out with the phone numbers and call them.
[01:02:56.774 --> 01:03:04.601]  We need links to the articles to all these White House advisors like Robert Shapiro and the Financial Times of London saying a terror attack would sure help us.
[01:03:04.601 --> 01:03:05.902]  It'd sure be great.
[01:03:05.902 --> 01:03:09.905]  Obama's got to get an Oklahoma City or 9-11 so he can get his New World Order.
[01:03:09.905 --> 01:03:12.547]  We need all those Republican neocons that wrote editorials.
[01:03:13.048 --> 01:03:14.873]  Saying how great September 11th was.
[01:03:14.873 --> 01:03:18.745]  See, they're all communicating with each other like we're too stupid to see it.
[01:03:18.745 --> 01:03:19.668]  Begging for it.
[01:03:19.668 --> 01:03:20.470]  Calling for it.
[01:03:22.259 --> 01:03:28.424]  All that stands between the New World Order, taking all the pension funds, launching World War III with Pakistan.
[01:03:28.424 --> 01:03:29.405]  They've got nukes.
[01:03:29.405 --> 01:03:34.348]  Every analyst says it will probably trigger World War III, not May.
[01:03:34.348 --> 01:03:36.170]  This is also part of framing Pakistan.
[01:03:36.170 --> 01:03:40.933]  It always has a geopolitical, external foreign policy element to the domestic policy.
[01:03:40.933 --> 01:03:43.075]  They like full spectrum, win-win-wins.
[01:03:43.075 --> 01:03:46.798]  I want everyone to listen to me very carefully right now.
[01:03:46.798 --> 01:03:48.139]  Please, take this to heart.
[01:03:49.841 --> 01:04:03.646]  All that stands between pre-humanity, our children, the innocent people, the folks on fixed incomes, people on social security, people that have paid into public and private pensions, the globalists that have done this in every other country, they've fully taken over.
[01:04:03.646 --> 01:04:16.190]  The only thing that stands between us and real hot tyranny, I mean the arrest wagons going around, the FEMA camps being filled, mushroom clouds, the only thing that stands between us and that
[01:04:17.205 --> 01:04:19.788]  Is we the people look in the mirror.
[01:04:19.788 --> 01:04:29.920]  If you look at the mainstream media, hundreds of newspapers, prestigious establishment magazines are lowering their guns on us from their pile of cess.
[01:04:31.545 --> 01:04:37.969]  And firing at InfoWars.com, Alex Jones, Dr. Pachinik, we are the resistance.
[01:04:37.969 --> 01:04:40.270]  When we come back, we're going to talk about this.
[01:04:40.270 --> 01:04:42.271]  You are the resistance, folks.
[01:04:42.271 --> 01:04:43.332]  You are the resistance.
[01:04:43.332 --> 01:04:45.773]  Don't underestimate the power that you have.
[01:04:45.773 --> 01:04:49.575]  We'll be right back with Steve Watson, Dr. Steve Pachinik coming up, Aaron Dykes.
[01:04:49.575 --> 01:04:50.536]  I have key intel straight ahead.
[01:05:00.405 --> 01:05:01.566]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:05:01.566 --> 01:05:08.509]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:05:08.509 --> 01:05:11.050]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:05:11.050 --> 01:05:16.433]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:05:16.433 --> 01:05:19.474]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:05:19.474 --> 01:05:21.535]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:05:21.795 --> 01:05:28.040]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:31.422]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:05:31.422 --> 01:05:37.206]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:05:37.206 --> 01:05:38.847]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:05:38.847 --> 01:05:40.148]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:05:40.148 --> 01:05:42.810]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:05:42.810 --> 01:05:47.053]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:05:47.053 --> 01:05:48.754]  You can find the video at www.
[01:05:49.835 --> 01:05:51.656]  End of America 3.com.
[01:05:51.656 --> 01:05:54.237]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[01:05:54.237 --> 01:05:58.098]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:05:58.098 --> 01:05:59.479]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:05:59.479 --> 01:06:02.580]  In constant sorrow,
[01:06:23.755 --> 01:06:27.383]  We're good to go.
[01:06:28.274 --> 01:06:34.138]  We're back live, it's the Alex Jones Show, May 5th, 2011, coming up at the top of the hour.
[01:06:34.138 --> 01:06:42.944]  Steve Arpchenik, top spy masterworks under five different US presidents to talk about the Bin Laden fable.
[01:06:42.944 --> 01:06:48.388]  Now we have President Barack Obama mimicking George W. Bush.
[01:06:48.388 --> 01:06:54.432]  He's descended on ground zero, and Obama, according to the Associated Press, is now basically repeating
[01:06:55.393 --> 01:07:10.995]  Exact similar phrases that George Bush used as he stood on the rubble in those days after 9-11 as Obama desperately attempts to seize on the political capital that this bin Laden raid has afforded him.
[01:07:10.995 --> 01:07:12.036]  But I'm delighted to say
[01:07:12.717 --> 01:07:34.383]  We've been joined by Paul Craig Roberts, who many of you will know of course was the father of Reaganomics, served as Assistant Treasury Secretary under Ronald Reagan, former editor of the Wall Street Journal, and of course Mr. Roberts is a prolific author and writer whose articles we eagerly await.
[01:07:34.383 --> 01:07:39.504]  We've posted his latest article on prisonplanet.com this morning.
[01:07:39.504 --> 01:07:41.705]  Mr. Roberts, great to have you on the show today.
[01:07:42.793 --> 01:07:44.575]  Thank you, Paul.
[01:07:44.575 --> 01:07:45.756]  Good to speak to you.
[01:07:45.756 --> 01:07:52.684]  Before you get started with me, I was fascinated by the piece yesterday.
[01:07:52.684 --> 01:07:55.648]  Your report, I think it was, on Steve Pizzini.
[01:07:56.812 --> 01:07:58.633]  Did I pronounce that right?
[01:07:58.633 --> 01:07:59.994]  Steve Pajenik, yeah.
[01:07:59.994 --> 01:08:02.116]  Yeah.
[01:08:02.116 --> 01:08:04.197]  I thought this was amazing.
[01:08:04.197 --> 01:08:22.971]  Not so much the Bin Laden part, because I think that's been known for some time, but his statement that he had been told by a general from, I think, Wolfowitz staff that 9-11 was an inside job and that he was willing himself, Steve Pajenik, to
[01:08:24.352 --> 01:08:27.755]  Testify on the oath before Congress and reveal the guy's name.
[01:08:27.755 --> 01:08:31.778]  Now this is an astonishing development.
[01:08:31.778 --> 01:08:33.219]  This is for real, I take it.
[01:08:33.219 --> 01:08:37.962]  I take it you've got this on tape or video or something.
[01:08:37.962 --> 01:08:43.607]  It was said live during Mr. Pchenik's interview with Alex Jones on Tuesday.
[01:08:43.607 --> 01:08:44.447]  And that's right.
[01:08:44.447 --> 01:08:49.991]  And it's an astounding admission which has been completely ignored by the mainstream media.
[01:08:49.991 --> 01:08:51.913]  They daren't even try and debunk it.
[01:08:53.086 --> 01:09:00.168]  You know, I'm not... His credentials are substantial.
[01:09:00.168 --> 01:09:04.909]  But what puzzles me about it is, I mean, that kind of marks him for a dead man, doesn't it?
[01:09:04.909 --> 01:09:08.450]  I mean, they're either going to ignore him or they're going to kill him.
[01:09:08.450 --> 01:09:20.193]  I mean, as well-connected as he's been in government, it seems to me he would know that if he says something like that, he's going to have an accident before anybody takes him up on the offer.
[01:09:20.193 --> 01:09:21.613]  I mean, that strikes me as...
[01:09:24.024 --> 01:09:27.846]  He's reckless, almost.
[01:09:27.846 --> 01:09:32.769]  I've been really puzzled about why he would say that.
[01:09:32.769 --> 01:09:42.115]  I mean, I can understand revealing it, but not forecasting that he was going to reveal it.
[01:09:42.115 --> 01:09:45.037]  That's one thing they won't let be revealed.
[01:09:45.037 --> 01:09:46.398]  They're not going to let that happen.
[01:09:47.316 --> 01:09:47.816]  Exactly.
[01:09:47.816 --> 01:09:49.477]  I mean, Alex asked him about that.
[01:09:49.477 --> 01:09:54.460]  Alex was trying to get him on air to say, you know, I'm not suicidal like the DC madam.
[01:09:54.460 --> 01:09:56.801]  And obviously we know what happened to her.
[01:09:56.801 --> 01:10:01.043]  But Pchenik basically said, you know, I'm a professional.
[01:10:01.043 --> 01:10:02.644]  I've got dirt on them.
[01:10:02.644 --> 01:10:04.845]  And he was basically not afraid of that.
[01:10:04.845 --> 01:10:07.867]  But he's actually coming up as a guest at the top of the hour.
[01:10:07.867 --> 01:10:14.550]  And that's something I can press him further on in the next hour of the show.
[01:10:14.550 --> 01:10:15.231]  My question
[01:10:15.891 --> 01:10:24.738]  My question for you, Mr Roberts, is you wrote on Monday that the whole Bin Laden thing had, quote, the odour of a staged event.
[01:10:24.738 --> 01:10:38.688]  Now you've been justified in that assessment with these Situation Room photos that the media told us were an account of Obama and Hillary Clinton watching the live assassination of Bin Laden unfold.
[01:10:38.688 --> 01:10:41.810]  That has now been documented to be completely fraudulent.
[01:10:41.810 --> 01:10:43.632]  The live video stream was cut off.
[01:10:43.632 --> 01:10:45.073]  They saw nothing of the raid.
[01:10:46.714 --> 01:10:50.357]  You've wrote this other article today which is excellent.
[01:10:50.357 --> 01:10:59.624]  What do you think are the most alarming discrepancies in this whole Bin Laden narrative that we've been sold on by the White House and the media?
[01:10:59.624 --> 01:11:11.674]  Well, you know Paul, the thing was never believable in the beginning because the original story of a firefight
[01:11:14.289 --> 01:11:27.239]  With the heroic SEALs taking on Al-Qaeda, which Rumsfeld described as the most highly trained, the most dangerous, most vicious killers on the planet.
[01:11:27.239 --> 01:11:35.106]  And so they get, the SEALs get into a firefight with these vicious, highly trained killers and they don't get a scratch.
[01:11:35.106 --> 01:11:37.928]  So that already tells you something stinks.
[01:11:38.772 --> 01:11:41.933]  Because anybody can hear a helicopter coming.
[01:11:41.933 --> 01:11:49.356]  You know, even people who are asleep.
[01:11:49.356 --> 01:11:55.178]  Then, before 48 hours passed, the whole story changes fundamentally.
[01:11:55.178 --> 01:11:57.579]  There's no firefight.
[01:11:57.579 --> 01:12:01.661]  Bin Laden's not a coward after all, hiding behind a woman.
[01:12:01.661 --> 01:12:05.802]  He's not even armed, says the White House press spokesman.
[01:12:05.802 --> 01:12:07.383]  The direct quote, he wasn't armed.
[01:12:08.726 --> 01:12:16.972]  And so, all of a sudden, we go from heroes in a firefight to cold-blooded murderers.
[01:12:16.972 --> 01:12:25.519]  And even worse, even if you believe the government story, you have to see it as the most botched operation in history.
[01:12:25.519 --> 01:12:36.387]  So why in the world would you kill the mastermind who has all the secrets of terrorism when he's unarmed, harmless, and surrounded?
[01:12:37.455 --> 01:12:41.658]  That's the last thing you would do is to kill him.
[01:12:41.658 --> 01:12:49.004]  And so that part of the story is not so much a discrepancy that's important.
[01:12:49.004 --> 01:12:51.807]  It's the story itself.
[01:12:51.807 --> 01:12:54.669]  It makes no sense.
[01:12:54.669 --> 01:12:59.052]  And the reason they had to say that is they didn't capture him.
[01:12:59.052 --> 01:12:59.913]  They didn't kill him.
[01:12:59.913 --> 01:13:00.794]  He wasn't there.
[01:13:00.794 --> 01:13:01.895]  He was already dead.
[01:13:01.895 --> 01:13:03.336]  This is a staged event.
[01:13:04.258 --> 01:13:12.741]  For a bunch of hidden agendas, not merely for Obama's popularity and poll ratings and re-election campaign.
[01:13:12.741 --> 01:13:14.281]  That's no doubt part of it.
[01:13:14.281 --> 01:13:18.603]  But there are other agendas that this event is being used for.
[01:13:18.603 --> 01:13:21.384]  For example, the justification of torture is one.
[01:13:23.436 --> 01:13:27.679]  Probably starting more trouble with Pakistan is another.
[01:13:27.679 --> 01:13:31.241]  More powers for homeland security is another.
[01:13:31.241 --> 01:13:40.267]  Probably more false flag attacks that they will say is due to al-Qaeda retaliation for killing bin Laden.
[01:13:40.267 --> 01:13:47.352]  There are all kinds of agendas that are hiding behind this false story.
[01:13:47.352 --> 01:13:51.295]  So, the dead giveaway is that
[01:13:52.672 --> 01:14:02.459]  If you actually did catch this guy, you wouldn't quickly throw the evidence of your success into the ocean.
[01:14:02.459 --> 01:14:11.366]  The minute you do that, the whole story becomes suspect, because there's no real explanation for why they dumped the body in the ocean.
[01:14:11.366 --> 01:14:16.150]  The story they give is obviously a fabrication, and it's incorrect.
[01:14:17.277 --> 01:14:21.899]  Uh, that they were giving him a quick burial in keeping with Muslim practices.
[01:14:21.899 --> 01:14:38.124]  This has been challenged by the Muslim demons, they say, that you're supposed to be buried in the ground with your head pointed toward Mecca, and that the only excuse for dumping somebody at sea is if it's a very long voyage and the body is decomposing.
[01:14:38.124 --> 01:14:42.146]  And so every aspect of the story is phony.
[01:14:42.146 --> 01:14:44.426]  There's nothing true about any of it.
[01:14:47.077 --> 01:14:51.860]  Other great puzzle, Paul, is why did they change the story?
[01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:57.304]  If you're going to pull off something like this, you've got to know what the story is and stick with it.
[01:14:57.304 --> 01:15:03.228]  And yet, before 48 Hours passes, the whole story has changed fundamentally.
[01:15:03.228 --> 01:15:03.729]  Why?
[01:15:03.729 --> 01:15:05.730]  What was the pressure to change the story?
[01:15:08.104 --> 01:15:10.745]  They didn't have to worry about Pakistan ratting on them.
[01:15:10.745 --> 01:15:19.450]  Pakistan is enough of an American public puppet that if it was ordered to shut up, it would shut up.
[01:15:19.450 --> 01:15:28.554]  I mean, Pakistan lets the United States conduct illegal military actions on its territory, killing its citizens.
[01:15:28.554 --> 01:15:34.677]  Pakistan lets the United States Army send the Pakistani Army into tribal areas, into entire provinces.
[01:15:35.734 --> 01:15:39.037]  Displacing entire populations of people.
[01:15:39.037 --> 01:15:46.465]  If White's and Tells Pakistan, hey, we're going to stage this thing and we want your help and you better not say anything about it, they're going to cooperate.
[01:16:01.465 --> 01:16:03.187]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:16:03.187 --> 01:16:08.493]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:16:08.493 --> 01:16:10.015]  Saving means to make money.

[01:16:27.070 --> 01:16:35.074]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:16:35.074 --> 01:16:40.317]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[01:17:00.967 --> 01:17:16.435]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:17:16.435 --> 01:17:20.117]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:17:21.127 --> 01:17:33.899]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:17:33.899 --> 01:17:41.165]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.

[01:17:59.850 --> 01:18:04.411]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:18:04.411 --> 01:18:05.311]  Number 1.
[01:18:05.311 --> 01:18:08.752]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:18:08.752 --> 01:18:09.612]  Number 2.
[01:18:09.612 --> 01:18:14.493]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:18:14.493 --> 01:18:15.233]  It's true.
[01:18:15.233 --> 01:18:20.114]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:18:20.114 --> 01:18:20.934]  Number 3.
[01:18:20.934 --> 01:18:24.515]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:18:24.515 --> 01:18:28.216]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:18:28.436 --> 01:18:29.216]  Number 4.
[01:18:29.216 --> 01:18:31.977]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:18:31.977 --> 01:18:35.658]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:18:35.658 --> 01:18:36.458]  Number 5.
[01:18:36.458 --> 01:18:40.599]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:18:40.599 --> 01:18:45.641]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:18:45.641 --> 01:18:49.822]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:18:49.822 --> 01:18:51.603]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:18:59.710 --> 01:19:03.553]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[01:19:03.553 --> 01:19:07.836]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.

[01:19:12.980 --> 01:19:18.484]  Not looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[01:19:18.484 --> 01:19:25.669]  Not worried about them moving south, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[01:19:28.403 --> 01:19:35.431]  We're American and be proud.
[01:19:35.431 --> 01:19:38.154]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[01:19:54.244 --> 01:20:01.368]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[01:20:01.368 --> 01:20:04.950]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[01:20:04.950 --> 01:20:08.651]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:08.651 --> 01:20:18.396]  The real question is, why did the story change?
[01:20:18.396 --> 01:20:21.218]  What's... What's going on is, uh...
[01:20:23.839 --> 01:20:51.125]  Are people in the government now, I'm just speculating, I don't have any idea, are people in the government now seeing that they don't want Obama, some of them don't want Obama again, and they see that he's managed to do this to boost his poll ratings by 24%, and so now they're going to undermine it because they want to get rid of him, or they'd rather have a different puppet, or something, all kinds of things are going on that we don't know about, and that might explain
[01:20:52.384 --> 01:20:59.107]  Why the administration, the government, is destroying its own story.
[01:20:59.107 --> 01:21:02.448]  It's not being destroyed by news people.
[01:21:02.448 --> 01:21:09.512]  The news people are still celebrating the victory over Bin Laden.
[01:21:09.512 --> 01:21:19.236]  And the news people have given the imprimatur to extra-legal murder of unarmed people.
[01:21:19.236 --> 01:21:21.357]  So it's not the news media who's exposed.
[01:21:22.609 --> 01:21:29.456]  It's the government itself that keeps changing the story, and where's the pressure coming from to change the story?
[01:21:29.456 --> 01:21:40.087]  I mean, why create such massive credibility problems for the government's own story?
[01:21:40.087 --> 01:21:46.193]  So maybe all the people inside the government are fighting each other over who they want to
[01:21:47.293 --> 01:21:48.434]  Run the next time.
[01:21:48.434 --> 01:21:52.417]  I don't know what's going on, but that's the biggest puzzle to me.
[01:21:52.417 --> 01:22:00.584]  Maybe somebody on your desk, maybe Steve today, can throw some light on that.
[01:22:00.584 --> 01:22:02.185]  That is the most interesting question.
[01:22:02.185 --> 01:22:07.830]  So, the two real questions, and I'll be finished here.
[01:22:07.830 --> 01:22:15.076]  One is, what are the real agendas that this news event is designed to further?
[01:22:16.244 --> 01:22:21.168]  And two, why did the government wreck its own story?
[01:22:21.168 --> 01:22:27.253]  By changing it before 48 hours are over.
[01:22:27.253 --> 01:22:34.759]  Without any obvious sources of pressure on them to change the story.
[01:22:34.759 --> 01:22:35.760]  It's amazing, I mean.
[01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:39.342]  The Kennedy story, the Kennedy was killed by Oswald, period.
[01:22:39.342 --> 01:22:42.445]  And we've had that story now for what, 40, 50 years or something.
[01:22:42.990 --> 01:22:43.754]  They don't change it.
[01:22:43.754 --> 01:22:45.623]  Why do they change the story?
[01:22:45.623 --> 01:22:46.628]  They haven't changed the 9-11 story.
[01:22:49.655 --> 01:22:50.276]  Well, exactly.
[01:22:50.276 --> 01:23:02.927]  I mean, you've got the press secretary, Carney, who's now being lambasted by all sides of the media as this flounderer, this failure, because he's having difficulty getting the fable straight.
[01:23:02.927 --> 01:23:04.508]  He keeps tripping over his words.
[01:23:04.508 --> 01:23:07.470]  He keeps giving contradictory explanations.
[01:23:07.470 --> 01:23:09.092]  And like you said, it's baffling.
[01:23:09.092 --> 01:23:12.635]  It's almost as if it's deliberately designed to look hokey.
[01:23:14.035 --> 01:23:17.077]  I mean, you've got neighbours surrounding this so-called compound.
[01:23:17.077 --> 01:23:19.458]  They say they'd never saw Bin Laden.
[01:23:19.458 --> 01:23:23.319]  It's a stone's throw away from a Pakistani military base.
[01:23:23.319 --> 01:23:25.920]  All the residents have to have ID cards.
[01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:28.922]  They have to go through checkpoints to get anywhere.
[01:23:28.922 --> 01:23:33.043]  And the only photos that have been released are of these victims.
[01:23:33.043 --> 01:23:35.484]  Of course, none of them are Bin Laden.
[01:23:35.484 --> 01:23:38.626]  It's increasingly starting to look like he wasn't, I mean,
[01:23:39.406 --> 01:23:44.209]  We know that every intelligence professional worth their salt said that he's been dead for nine years.
[01:23:44.209 --> 01:23:53.775]  It's starting to look as if perhaps some members of the Bin Laden family were there and that's what they used as the reason to go in.
[01:23:53.775 --> 01:24:01.520]  But I mean, it's like in your article today, you quote this email that you received from a reader who asks, you know, why the government so
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:07.271]  sloppy in its lies that it virtually makes no effort to make them appear credible.
[01:24:07.271 --> 01:24:12.983]  I mean, why are they so arrogant in their total disregard for the intellect of the American people?
[01:24:13.692 --> 01:24:16.873]  I think the answer to that, Paul, is they got away with 9-11.
[01:24:16.873 --> 01:24:22.836]  They blew up two skyscrapers in plain view of everybody, in plain view of their TV cameras.
[01:24:22.836 --> 01:24:27.398]  We've got recordings all over the world of these buildings being blown up.
[01:24:27.398 --> 01:24:30.339]  Anybody that looks at those buildings can see they're being blown up.
[01:24:30.339 --> 01:24:32.159]  They're not falling down.
[01:24:32.159 --> 01:24:37.001]  These are not buildings falling down from structural damage from an airliner or fire.
[01:24:37.001 --> 01:24:38.362]  These buildings are blowing up.
[01:24:38.362 --> 01:24:40.023]  You can see they're blowing up.
[01:24:40.023 --> 01:24:40.983]  If they get away with that,
[01:24:41.883 --> 01:25:05.051]  If they can get away with the fable that a few Saudis with box cutters can outwit all 16 American intelligence agencies, all the intelligence agencies of NATO, of Israel even, can outwit NORAD, air traffic control, airport security four times in one morning, can cause the state-of-the-art Pentagon air defenses to fail.
[01:25:05.051 --> 01:25:07.712]  Anybody can pull off this superhero stuff.
[01:25:07.712 --> 01:25:08.932]  How can anybody believe that?
[01:25:10.216 --> 01:25:11.057]  You can't.
[01:25:11.057 --> 01:25:13.758]  I mean, did you see the film V for Vendetta?
[01:25:13.758 --> 01:25:14.539]  Yeah.
[01:25:14.539 --> 01:25:17.440]  Where the superhero blows up the British Parliament?
[01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:23.244]  Well, hell, the 9-11 attack makes that look like nothing.
[01:25:23.244 --> 01:25:25.125]  And yet people fall for these things.
[01:25:25.125 --> 01:25:35.211]  I mean, so I guess that's the reason the government just shows it doesn't make any effort to even make a credible lie.
[01:25:35.211 --> 01:25:36.452]  It just knows that
[01:25:37.584 --> 01:25:42.068]  It can use the Patriot card and 80% of the people will fall for it.
[01:25:42.068 --> 01:25:43.749]  The patriotism will.
[01:25:43.749 --> 01:25:45.250]  And they'll be, oh, we got him.
[01:25:45.250 --> 01:25:46.631]  Ah, we got the towelhead.
[01:25:46.631 --> 01:25:49.613]  So that's what they rely on, I think.
[01:25:49.613 --> 01:25:53.356]  They don't think anybody is going to think about it.
[01:25:53.356 --> 01:25:56.058]  People are just going to celebrate.
[01:25:56.058 --> 01:26:04.524]  And if you start thinking about it, you have to give up celebrating, and they'd rather celebrate than be suspicious of their government.
[01:26:04.524 --> 01:26:05.565]  That's probably the
[01:26:06.368 --> 01:26:13.773]  The answer, I thought that reader that you quoted made a very good point, raised the central question.
[01:26:13.773 --> 01:26:19.937]  That's why I put it in my article today, but I think that's the answer, Paul.
[01:26:19.937 --> 01:26:24.660]  They know, look, they've always got away with everything.
[01:26:24.660 --> 01:26:32.865]  Remember the Maine, the Gulf of Tonkin, weapons of mass destruction.
[01:26:32.865 --> 01:26:35.166]  Governments all over the world have got away with these things.
[01:26:37.134 --> 01:26:39.255]  Hitler got away with the Reichstag fire.
[01:26:39.255 --> 01:26:44.079]  They blamed it on the left wing or some deranged commie.
[01:26:44.079 --> 01:26:47.422]  These things are commonplace in history and they always were.
[01:26:47.422 --> 01:26:54.988]  In fact, I wonder if there are any examples that didn't work.
[01:26:54.988 --> 01:26:56.329]  I can't think of any offhand.
[01:26:56.329 --> 01:26:57.670]  Maybe there are some somewhere.
[01:27:00.370 --> 01:27:02.752]  Well, it's with everything, like you said.
[01:27:02.752 --> 01:27:06.716]  I mean, Operation Gladio, they got away with that as well.
[01:27:06.716 --> 01:27:14.964]  And I think it comes down to the fact that when people don't have time or don't have the effort to scratch the surface on these things,
[01:27:15.464 --> 01:27:23.566]  They just throw in their lot with the US government as if it's some kind of baseball team, like they scored a major victory.
[01:27:23.566 --> 01:27:31.209]  I mean, in the aftermath of the bombardment of Iraq, pizza and beer sales went through the roof.
[01:27:31.209 --> 01:27:39.631]  And it's kind of just this dumbing down, this reduction of what amounts in the end to the slaughter of thousands and millions of people.
[01:27:40.231 --> 01:27:40.891]  I think that must be it.
[01:28:09.082 --> 01:28:16.728]  We had the Prime Minister of Pakistan Yusuf Ranza Jilani saying, quote, these attacks are creating a lot of problems for us.
[01:28:16.728 --> 01:28:19.450]  The US will have to stop these attacks.
[01:28:19.450 --> 01:28:27.595]  And of course, there were massive protests in Pakistan about these drone strikes just days before this bin Laden fraud was rolled out.
[01:28:28.736 --> 01:28:32.579]  Um, Pakistan is now being geopolitically isolated.
[01:28:32.579 --> 01:28:35.901]  They're saying that Pakistan was harboring Bin Laden all along.
[01:28:35.901 --> 01:28:39.323]  Of course, that only means that so was the CIA.
[01:28:39.323 --> 01:28:42.385]  It's tied with the Pakistani ISI at the hip.
[01:28:42.385 --> 01:28:48.489]  Those are the two organizations that created Bin Laden as a terrorist leader in the first place.
[01:28:48.489 --> 01:28:58.196]  So a lot of people are suggesting that it's a kind of reprisal against Pakistan for their unwillingness to continue going along with this, supporting the
[01:28:58.616 --> 01:28:59.757]  Hegemony of the U.S.
[01:28:59.757 --> 01:29:00.778]  Empire.
[01:29:00.778 --> 01:29:07.724]  Over the last year, Alex has told you about and many of you have experienced emergencies and disasters in unprecedented numbers.
[01:29:07.724 --> 01:29:10.367]  People have had to literally run for their lives.
[01:29:10.367 --> 01:29:12.809]  Folks, this is Steve Shank with eFoods Direct.
[01:29:12.809 --> 01:29:17.193]  I'm not here to scare you, but when disaster strikes, you won't have time to think.
[01:29:17.193 --> 01:29:18.654]  You must act automatically.
[01:29:18.874 --> 01:29:22.397]  What does a pilot do when the helicopter engine fails in flight?
[01:29:22.397 --> 01:29:25.160]  No time to think, just act automatically.
[01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:33.508]  When the alert is broadcast, the alarm sounds, or the knock comes on your door, you'll need to be ready to act without thinking of what to do or what you need.
[01:29:33.508 --> 01:29:36.311]  You need a 5-Day Extreme Emergency Kit.
[01:29:36.551 --> 01:29:46.581]  With serious supplies and real food to secure two adults for five days, this powerful $300 Extreme Emergency Kit is free with an order of at least $995 from eFoodsDirect.

[01:29:50.785 --> 01:29:50.825]  800-409-5633.
[01:30:04.494 --> 01:30:05.755]  Tyranny is here.
[01:30:05.755 --> 01:30:09.618]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:30:09.618 --> 01:30:12.080]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:17.784]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:30:17.784 --> 01:30:24.049]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:30:24.449 --> 01:30:30.432]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:30:30.432 --> 01:30:34.614]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:30:34.614 --> 01:30:38.897]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:30:38.897 --> 01:30:44.840]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:48.402]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:30:48.402 --> 01:30:50.383]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:30:50.383 --> 01:30:50.803]  It's here.

[01:31:01.288 --> 01:31:03.009]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:31:03.009 --> 01:31:08.312]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:31:08.312 --> 01:31:09.853]  Saving means to make money.
[01:31:09.853 --> 01:31:18.638]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:31:19.358 --> 01:31:26.901]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:31:26.901 --> 01:31:34.905]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:31:34.905 --> 01:31:40.127]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:31:40.127 --> 01:31:42.308]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[01:31:59.838 --> 01:32:04.401]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[01:32:04.401 --> 01:32:05.302]  Number one.
[01:32:05.302 --> 01:32:08.725]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:08.725 --> 01:32:09.585]  Number two.
[01:32:09.585 --> 01:32:14.489]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:14.489 --> 01:32:15.229]  It's true.
[01:32:15.229 --> 01:32:20.113]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:20.113 --> 01:32:20.934]  Number three.
[01:32:20.934 --> 01:32:24.516]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:24.516 --> 01:32:28.219]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:28.419 --> 01:32:29.220]  Number 4.
[01:32:29.220 --> 01:32:31.962]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:31.962 --> 01:32:35.646]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:32:35.646 --> 01:32:36.447]  Number 5.
[01:32:36.447 --> 01:32:40.590]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:32:40.590 --> 01:32:45.355]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:32:45.635 --> 01:32:49.798]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:49.798 --> 01:32:51.599]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:51.599 --> 01:32:53.841]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:32:53.841 --> 01:32:56.462]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:32:56.462 --> 01:33:02.987]  Coast to Coast.
[01:33:02.987 --> 01:33:05.028]  Direct from Austin.
[01:33:05.028 --> 01:33:08.250]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:33:22.172 --> 01:33:26.593]  And we're cutting the lies down.
[01:33:26.593 --> 01:33:31.794]  Well, we see the 2012 kickoff of Obama's campaign.
[01:33:42.458 --> 01:33:45.121]  They claim they dumped the body of Bin Laden in the ocean.
[01:33:45.121 --> 01:33:47.784]  They released a fake photo Sunday night.
[01:33:47.784 --> 01:33:50.046]  Yesterday morning had to admit it was a fake photo.
[01:33:50.046 --> 01:33:52.790]  Now they've got new fake photos.
[01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:54.632]  We'll play just a few seconds of this.
[01:33:54.632 --> 01:33:56.994]  They've released of course
[01:33:58.456 --> 01:34:04.522]  Cartoons showing Bin Laden shooting his AK-47 and the Navy SEALs taking him out.
[01:34:04.522 --> 01:34:07.585]  We'll roll some of that in the background right now for folks.
[01:34:07.585 --> 01:34:10.428]  This is so cartoonish.
[01:34:10.428 --> 01:34:17.955]  And what concerns me more than anything is that our expert guests have broken down here on air.
[01:34:19.059 --> 01:34:35.087]  Webster Tarpley, investigative journalist Wayne Madsen, others, we've also seen this in the foreign news, that Pakistan was starting to make deals with Saudi Arabia, that Saudi Arabia knows it's being double-crossed by the West, and that there was going to be big movement in Pakistan.
[01:34:35.087 --> 01:34:37.088]  Pakistan said, get your drones out of the country.
[01:34:37.848 --> 01:34:40.189]  And then magically, this happens.
[01:34:40.189 --> 01:34:51.394]  There's this raid, and now they're saying that Pakistan knew he was there for six years, as if Western intelligence wouldn't know that either, and they won't produce the body.
[01:34:51.394 --> 01:34:58.476]  This is a serious frame-up, it looks like, of Pakistan moving towards serious confrontations.
[01:34:58.476 --> 01:35:07.300]  Lieutenant General Hamid Gul, former head of Pakistani intelligence, really leading the attack on the Soviets in the 1980s, called a hero by our media at the time.
[01:35:07.900 --> 01:35:13.726]  He's been called now by some of our media the real leader of Al Qaeda, which he says is asinine.
[01:35:13.726 --> 01:35:16.448]  General Gould, thank you so much for joining us, sir.
[01:35:16.448 --> 01:35:19.251]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:35:19.251 --> 01:35:22.654]  I know you have a lot of other media to attend to.
[01:35:22.654 --> 01:35:24.355]  We've only got about 25 minutes with you.
[01:35:24.355 --> 01:35:25.656]  Sir, you've got the floor.
[01:35:25.656 --> 01:35:33.884]  Break down, now that we have some more time, to look at this propaganda move, where you stand and what you believe is happening geopolitically.
[01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:48.731]  Well, I think they are targeting Pakistan and I think Patriots, as it was said by New York Times, is now gearing up, is limbering up for launching his third offensive against Pakistan.
[01:35:48.731 --> 01:35:51.673]  So I think that is where Pakistan is being cornered now.
[01:35:51.673 --> 01:35:59.820]  A case is being built against Pakistan and they are saying that ISI was harbouring this great terrorist.
[01:35:59.820 --> 01:36:03.223]  But at the same time, if you look at it professionally,
[01:36:04.083 --> 01:36:28.382]  All the time, the CIA, the political leadership of America, and even all the European countries and their intelligence services were actually putting Pakistani intelligence on the wrong posse by saying that the high-value targets were hiding in North Waziristan and that terrain which adjoins with Afghanistan.
[01:36:28.382 --> 01:36:31.705]  So, they were pounding Pakistani civilians.
[01:36:32.425 --> 01:36:39.929]  And poor, hapless villagers there with their drone attacks, with the hellfires and with their Reaper missiles.
[01:36:39.929 --> 01:36:51.515]  So they have caused something like 2,500 casualties when the man that they were hunting was actually hiding in one of the urban centers of Pakistan.
[01:36:51.515 --> 01:36:53.056]  Now, this is remarkable.
[01:36:53.056 --> 01:36:59.059]  I mean, it is not... It's an intelligence... Okay, we accept they're virgin, and we say that they are not...
[01:36:59.959 --> 01:37:00.260]  I think so.
[01:37:18.135 --> 01:37:27.143]  Because the CIA and FBI and MI6 had been given free hand in Pakistan to hunt down the terrorist.
[01:37:27.143 --> 01:37:34.449]  We had caught so many of them, from Khalid Sheikh Mohammed to Faraj al-Libi and all the others from the urban centers of Pakistan.
[01:37:34.449 --> 01:37:39.914]  So why were they not also responsible for this failure?
[01:37:39.914 --> 01:37:43.858]  Agreed that there have been intelligence failures in this intelligence craft.
[01:37:44.518 --> 01:37:46.979]  Failures are not something which is outlandish.
[01:37:46.979 --> 01:37:49.000]  Sometimes they do happen.
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:38:02.226]  But ISI, instead of being lauded for its good work, I think ISI has been scapegoated by the CIA and all the other bigwigs there in America.
[01:38:02.226 --> 01:38:05.088]  And they want to now build a case against Pakistan.
[01:38:05.088 --> 01:38:09.490]  Although Pakistan really is suffering so much because our sovereignty has been trampled over.
[01:38:10.336 --> 01:38:12.197]  Our security has been breached.
[01:38:12.197 --> 01:38:21.900]  These helicopters, they had spotted the blind areas in our radar coverage and they came in as if they were the enemies of Pakistan.
[01:38:21.900 --> 01:38:27.442]  Now it brings to light that the relationship with Pakistan, America's relationship,
[01:38:27.962 --> 01:38:31.685]  Well, always one of animosity, not of friendship.
[01:38:31.685 --> 01:38:42.853]  And while we were being told that we are friends of America and we are doing everything possible for them, we lost something like 35,000 lives in this process.
[01:38:42.853 --> 01:38:49.518]  And we suffered a loss of $68 billion in economic terms only.
[01:38:49.518 --> 01:38:55.082]  And everything else that went wrong with Pakistan, the revenge war and so on and so forth.
[01:38:55.082 --> 01:38:57.024]  Pakistan has suffered enormously.
[01:38:57.725 --> 01:39:01.428]  But now they tell us that you are responsible for everything.
[01:39:01.428 --> 01:39:03.250]  Isn't it amazing?
[01:39:03.250 --> 01:39:09.556]  And if, let's say, Osama is the one that they killed yesterday, why did they have to kill him?
[01:39:09.556 --> 01:39:11.077]  He was a sick man.
[01:39:11.077 --> 01:39:14.040]  He could have been hauled up in the helicopter and taken away.
[01:39:14.780 --> 01:39:18.822]  And I can imagine they haven't shown the pictures.
[01:39:18.822 --> 01:39:21.323]  They used to show the pictures of Saddam Hussein.
[01:39:21.323 --> 01:39:24.605]  And they used to show his teeth also inside of his mouth.
[01:39:24.605 --> 01:39:26.125]  And they used to rejoice over it.
[01:39:26.125 --> 01:39:32.208]  And now when it comes to Osama, they say that dump him in the sea as soon as possible.
[01:39:32.868 --> 01:39:41.457]  I think there is a lot that goes unsaid, and I think it has to be an untold story which has to come out one day.
[01:39:41.457 --> 01:39:43.620]  And I think a probe must be held.
[01:39:43.620 --> 01:39:47.544]  If the American administration is reluctant to hold that probe themselves,
[01:39:48.144 --> 01:40:00.617]  Let the international community demand from them that we ignore the 9-11 thing because you said that this had happened to us and we didn't ask for the evidence.
[01:40:00.617 --> 01:40:03.280]  But now it's about time that we ask for the evidence.
[01:40:04.215 --> 01:40:10.279]  General Gould, you brought up a point that is absolutely central, obviously, here.
[01:40:10.279 --> 01:40:16.404]  The saber-rattling began against Pakistan recently when Pakistan said enough of the drones.
[01:40:16.404 --> 01:40:19.146]  I've interviewed Special Forces troops on air.
[01:40:19.146 --> 01:40:22.988]  We've had Colonel Schaefer on repeatedly.
[01:40:22.988 --> 01:40:24.429]  We've had calls from listeners.
[01:40:24.429 --> 01:40:26.511]  It's been admitted in the news that U.S.
[01:40:26.511 --> 01:40:27.291]  troops, CIA,
[01:40:28.132 --> 01:40:35.856]  Special forces given unfettered access everywhere in Pakistan for now many, many years.
[01:40:35.856 --> 01:40:41.419]  And the fact that they're blaming Pakistan and saying you knew he was there for six years.
[01:40:41.419 --> 01:40:46.021]  You just threw the gauntlet right back down and said you were all over this country.
[01:40:46.021 --> 01:40:50.183]  You've been directing the Pakistani army into regions to back you up.
[01:40:50.623 --> 01:41:04.266]  Going into tribal areas, which of course, as you have pointed out, does stir up the population, and then they're called terrorists, and now they have us believe, in the heart of your West Point, in the heart of much of your intelligence system, he was there.
[01:41:04.266 --> 01:41:15.109]  So, if he was there, basically what you're saying, correct me if I'm wrong, 100% six years, the US, British, Israelis, they knew as well.
[01:41:16.690 --> 01:41:19.773]  That's indeed, because I think they have to share the responsibility.
[01:41:19.773 --> 01:41:30.624]  They can't shrug it off, because they were the superior partner in this war against terrorism, and they had more resources, far, far, far more resources than ISI ever possessed.
[01:41:30.624 --> 01:41:39.613]  So, you were responsible, equally responsible, and besides, you were all the time focusing the ISI, directing them towards the Northwest Frontier Province.
[01:41:39.613 --> 01:41:40.534]  Why were you doing this?
[01:41:42.675 --> 01:41:44.515]  They always get away.
[01:41:44.515 --> 01:41:47.096]  They never are answerable.
[01:41:47.096 --> 01:41:52.658]  They were never answerable for 9-11 because no heads were rolled at that time.
[01:41:52.658 --> 01:41:56.180]  None from the air traffic control, none from the FBI, none from the CIA.
[01:41:57.261 --> 01:42:02.907]  And none from the Air Force, which took 112 minutes to come into action.
[01:42:02.907 --> 01:42:03.768]  Can you imagine?
[01:42:03.768 --> 01:42:07.373]  They killed Osama bin Laden, if at all that was Osama bin Laden.
[01:42:07.373 --> 01:42:07.994]  I don't believe.
[01:42:07.994 --> 01:42:10.477]  There are a lot of theories which are going on here.
[01:42:10.477 --> 01:42:12.079]  But suppose they killed Osama bin Laden.
[01:42:12.079 --> 01:42:13.100]  Why did they have to kill him?
[01:42:14.421 --> 01:42:24.290]  If they had asked the ISI, pointed out to the ISI, which they knew, then ISI would capture him alive.
[01:42:24.290 --> 01:42:30.795]  And then he would be put on trial and he will spill the beans that 9-11 was not done by him.
[01:42:30.795 --> 01:42:37.461]  And this was the fear because of which they didn't inform the ISI and they went for this hunt themselves independently.
[01:43:00.931 --> 01:43:07.878]  Over the last year, Alex has told you about and many of you have experienced emergencies and disasters in unprecedented numbers.
[01:43:07.878 --> 01:43:10.520]  People have had to literally run for their lives.
[01:43:10.520 --> 01:43:12.962]  Folks, this is Steve Schenck with eFoods Direct.
[01:43:12.962 --> 01:43:17.326]  I'm not here to scare you, but when disaster strikes, you won't have time to think.
[01:43:17.326 --> 01:43:18.808]  You must act automatically.
[01:43:19.028 --> 01:43:22.532]  What does a pilot do when the helicopter engine fails in flight?
[01:43:22.532 --> 01:43:25.315]  No time to think, just act automatically.
[01:43:25.315 --> 01:43:33.684]  When the alert is broadcast, the alarm sounds, or the knock comes on your door, you'll need to be ready to act without thinking of what to do or what you need.
[01:43:33.684 --> 01:43:36.447]  You need a 5-Day Extreme Emergency Kit.
[01:43:36.707 --> 01:43:46.393]  With serious supplies and real food to secure two adults for five days, this powerful $300 Extreme Emergency Kit is free with an order of at least $995 from eFoodsDirect.

[01:44:00.462 --> 01:44:01.622]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:44:01.622 --> 01:44:08.565]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:44:08.565 --> 01:44:11.106]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:44:11.106 --> 01:44:16.487]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:44:16.487 --> 01:44:19.528]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:44:19.528 --> 01:44:21.589]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:44:21.849 --> 01:44:28.093]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:44:28.093 --> 01:44:31.475]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:44:31.475 --> 01:44:37.259]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:44:37.259 --> 01:44:38.900]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:44:38.900 --> 01:44:40.201]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:44:40.201 --> 01:44:42.863]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:44:42.863 --> 01:44:47.105]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:44:47.105 --> 01:44:48.806]  You can find the video at www.
[01:44:49.887 --> 01:44:51.711]  End of America 3.com.
[01:44:51.711 --> 01:44:54.297]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[01:45:02.062 --> 01:45:06.025]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:45:06.025 --> 01:45:14.892]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:45:14.892 --> 01:45:19.516]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:45:19.516 --> 01:45:30.345]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:45:30.965 --> 01:45:40.467]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:45:40.467 --> 01:45:45.889]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:45:45.889 --> 01:45:53.390]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:45:53.390 --> 01:45:56.131]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[01:46:01.303 --> 01:46:05.324]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:46:05.324 --> 01:46:08.565]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:46:08.565 --> 01:46:13.346]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:46:13.346 --> 01:46:19.748]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:46:19.748 --> 01:46:21.989]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:46:22.529 --> 01:46:22.829]  Tim Geithner?
[01:46:22.829 --> 01:46:23.349]  Bernanke?
[01:46:23.349 --> 01:46:24.130]  They're arsonists!
[01:46:24.130 --> 01:46:25.290]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:46:25.290 --> 01:46:27.531]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:46:41.437 --> 01:46:43.539]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:46:43.539 --> 01:46:48.703]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:46:48.703 --> 01:47:01.473]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:47:01.473 --> 01:47:05.056]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[01:47:05.056 --> 01:47:08.279]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:47:16.119 --> 01:47:34.746]  I saw on press TV last night the Iranian government is saying they have intel that Al-Qaeda, back from when Al-Qaeda was the good guys in the 80s, was going to leak the fact that US intelligence was basically puppeteering terrorists to then blame it
[01:47:35.326 --> 01:47:35.667]  I don't
[01:47:58.330 --> 01:47:59.971]  He ran the 7-7 bombings in London.
[01:47:59.971 --> 01:48:07.693]  He is MI6 and has an MI6 security clearance to travel wherever he wishes while he's on the news as the head terrorist.
[01:48:07.693 --> 01:48:15.156]  Ammar al-Awlaki, trained in the U.S., born in the U.S., Fox News reports, does dine secretly at the Pentagon and get orders.
[01:48:15.156 --> 01:48:17.356]  He then runs the Patsy attacks.
[01:48:17.356 --> 01:48:24.218]  As the former head of Pakistani intelligence, someone with connections, I know you don't like to speculate, but looking at the evidence we have,
[01:48:26.380 --> 01:48:40.510]  Bottom line, there is this group they call Al-Qaeda that are really double-triple agents, carrying out events to then be framed on Iraq, on Libya, on Pakistan, on Iran, a cookie cutter, whoever they want to attack.
[01:48:40.510 --> 01:48:45.974]  Is that a correct assessment in my analysis, or can you add to that, General Gould?
[01:48:46.969 --> 01:48:48.009]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:48:48.009 --> 01:48:50.290]  I think you are absolutely on the dot.
[01:48:50.290 --> 01:48:51.571]  This is what they're doing.
[01:48:51.571 --> 01:49:00.314]  They are out to conquer the world at the cost of the American people, their comfort, their lives, their blood, at the cost of their hard-earned dollars.
[01:49:00.314 --> 01:49:03.656]  They have, this group is devastating.
[01:49:03.656 --> 01:49:11.799]  I mean, they are harboring such ambitions which are anti-humanity, which are anti, above all, the American people.
[01:49:12.459 --> 01:49:22.869]  And if you give them free hand, now they are trying to go for Pakistan, and this will be disaster because a desperate Pakistan would be a terrible thing for them to handle.
[01:49:22.869 --> 01:49:26.032]  I don't know why they are building up case against Pakistan.
[01:49:26.032 --> 01:49:31.557]  Raymond Davis, in that case, the Russian intelligence
[01:49:32.217 --> 01:49:33.518]  He gave out the information.
[01:49:33.518 --> 01:49:40.561]  Pakistan was unfortunately not able to do so because of the reason, because America come down hard upon them.
[01:49:40.561 --> 01:49:48.505]  But he was carrying some ounces of enriched uranium and he was to go and carry out some kind of action somewhere else.
[01:49:49.185 --> 01:49:56.368]  And then blame it on Pakistan that Pakistan's nuclear assets are leaky and therefore they have to be taken out.
[01:49:56.368 --> 01:49:58.069]  They have to be plucked out.
[01:49:58.069 --> 01:50:08.613]  And this is my fear is that they have spotted the areas from where they can infiltrate and they can come and pick up our nuclear assets or do whatever they want
[01:50:09.113 --> 01:50:21.724]  Because they have such liberty of movement here, unfortunately, because of Pervaiz Musharraf, who was a dictator, and they supported him to the hilt, and he framed such policies which are being now followed by the present regime.
[01:50:24.486 --> 01:50:48.312]  Which called itself democratic, but it is not democratic, because it is the product of the NRO, the National Reconstruction Order, which was actually stage-managed by Condoleezza Rice, and it was signed between David Willibrand of the UK and Richard Boucher from the American side, and, of course, President Zardari from this side, and Benazir at that time.
[01:50:48.752 --> 01:50:54.878]  But Benazir became a little violent and she started reacting, so she had to be removed by them.
[01:50:54.878 --> 01:51:03.486]  If you remember, John Negroponte came here and he wanted to talk to her that she was becoming rebellious and she refused to meet him.
[01:51:03.486 --> 01:51:06.269]  And then thereafter, she was no more.
[01:51:06.269 --> 01:51:10.133]  I think this is a very dirty game which is being played by this group.
[01:51:12.621 --> 01:51:13.021]  I don't
[01:51:33.667 --> 01:51:34.007]  I don't
[01:51:49.638 --> 01:51:56.001]  Bombardments going in, getting the nukes, and then starting a larger attack, and then having India attack.
[01:51:56.001 --> 01:51:58.062]  But the word is China's not going to put up with this.
[01:51:58.062 --> 01:52:00.243]  I mean, we're talking about World War III.
[01:52:00.243 --> 01:52:04.765]  General, please give us the possible scenarios and the time frame on this.
[01:52:05.811 --> 01:52:23.756]  Well, I think it was McChrystal's idea, and he, in a briefing to the president, he had said that all he needs is a couple of helicopters and some commandos and an abseiling rope, and then he can go and pluck out anything that you have.
[01:52:23.756 --> 01:52:31.639]  And I mean, he said, I'll require a packing of three helicopters, and they can take out Pakistan's, all the nuclear triggers.
[01:52:32.339 --> 01:52:36.842]  But then they thought the better of it, because Pakistan's nuclear assets are dispersed.
[01:52:36.842 --> 01:52:43.346]  And if you touch Pakistan's nuclear assets, a lot of countries in the region who are very dear to America may be in trouble.
[01:52:43.346 --> 01:52:52.831]  Besides that, I think right behind our back, China, who is a very reliable friend, Pakistan will be left with no option but to lean upon China.
[01:52:52.831 --> 01:52:57.634]  And that could, as you are very rightly pointing out, that could start a third world war.
[01:52:57.634 --> 01:52:58.834]  It is very dangerous.
[01:52:58.834 --> 01:53:01.256]  I don't know why are they trying to play with fire.
[01:53:01.756 --> 01:53:06.961]  Because it will ignite an inferno which will consume the entire region.
[01:53:06.961 --> 01:53:18.933]  They're completely power-mad, sir, and they've been setting up a secret police grid, a demonization grid of real American patriots that just want to be a good country with a Bill of Rights and Constitution, who don't want to be an empire.
[01:53:18.933 --> 01:53:23.098]  But we have this wicked group that has seized us, and it just gives me chills.
[01:53:23.658 --> 01:53:23.878]  I don't
[01:53:47.620 --> 01:53:54.464]  In the few minutes we've got left with you, General, getting back to your intel connections in government.
[01:53:54.464 --> 01:53:58.826]  I know you don't like to speculate, but we know this official story.
[01:53:58.826 --> 01:54:02.108]  Now they admit he didn't fire back, that he didn't use the wife as a shield.
[01:54:02.108 --> 01:54:04.489]  They've already put out a fake photo a day and a half ago.
[01:54:04.489 --> 01:54:06.490]  They say more fake photos coming.
[01:54:06.490 --> 01:54:09.612]  And we know their history of faking documents and photos.
[01:54:09.612 --> 01:54:11.553]  This whole thing stinks to high heaven.
[01:54:11.553 --> 01:54:16.036]  Much of our media is turning against the President, saying people are not buying this.
[01:54:17.137 --> 01:54:19.919]  But what best do you know?
[01:54:19.919 --> 01:54:24.744]  Because now the Pakistani military has been able to go in, but it's all been scooped out.
[01:54:24.744 --> 01:54:25.805]  What was there?
[01:54:25.805 --> 01:54:26.806]  What is the intel?
[01:54:26.806 --> 01:54:32.572]  What does Pakistani ISI, what does the Pakistani army think really went on in that compound?
[01:54:32.572 --> 01:54:40.180]  I mean, obviously, it's the frame up of Pakistan, but do you have any intel on how this theater was executed?
[01:54:40.959 --> 01:54:48.041]  Yeah, I think much of it what they have said, the helicopter sneaking in and this that the other, that is true.
[01:54:48.041 --> 01:54:51.563]  Because they did come and there are eyewitnesses who have reported this.
[01:54:51.563 --> 01:54:55.224]  I was just watching on the TV channel.
[01:54:55.224 --> 01:54:57.965]  A lot of people in the neighborhood were giving the stories.
[01:54:58.485 --> 01:55:02.349]  But whether Osama bin Laden was there or not, it is not clear.
[01:55:02.349 --> 01:55:04.371]  And they have hidden this fact.
[01:55:04.371 --> 01:55:06.834]  And the ISI is embarrassed.
[01:55:06.834 --> 01:55:11.638]  And Pakistani nation is up in arms against the ISI and the army.
[01:55:11.638 --> 01:55:14.321]  They look, this is what you have done to us.
[01:55:14.321 --> 01:55:18.866]  You have allowed invaders to come in and do things on their own.
[01:55:19.626 --> 01:55:24.249]  And you have allowed the coverage gaps.
[01:55:24.249 --> 01:55:24.669]  Why?
[01:55:24.669 --> 01:55:28.571]  Because we are investing so much money in you and this is what you have done to us.
[01:55:28.571 --> 01:55:37.296]  So I think very soon there is going to be a policy shift as far as Pakistan is concerned because pressure is mounting on the regime, on the government.
[01:55:37.296 --> 01:55:42.479]  And they will have to simply say, if you were to ask me, that you have done now your job.
[01:55:42.479 --> 01:55:48.022]  If you think that this was the target that you were looking for and you ravaged the whole world because of this,
[01:55:48.522 --> 01:55:55.246]  Now you've got him, so please finish us, leave us alone, and Yankee, please go home.
[01:55:55.246 --> 01:55:57.007]  You will be also at rest.
[01:55:57.007 --> 01:55:59.649]  Your boys and girls are being killed unnecessarily.
[01:55:59.649 --> 01:56:01.010]  You're squandering your dollars.
[01:56:01.010 --> 01:56:05.392]  135 billion dollars a year, for heaven's sake.
[01:56:05.392 --> 01:56:09.455]  Taxpayers' money being squandered in Afghanistan on a war which has already been lost.
[01:56:10.700 --> 01:56:14.242]  General, we've only got a few minutes left with you, and we appreciate your time.
[01:56:14.242 --> 01:56:18.743]  General Hamid Gul joins us, former head of Pakistani intelligence.
[01:56:18.743 --> 01:56:30.629]  Unfortunately, I want to have to relay to you and the rest of the world that I'm monitoring liberal, conservative, mainline radio and TV, and I want to give you the bad news that they are in just a matter of hours.
[01:56:30.629 --> 01:56:38.192]  First, it was cut the couple billion you're given that, as you point out, you spend way, you know, many times more trying to carry out
[01:56:38.692 --> 01:56:39.132]  I don't
[01:56:58.886 --> 01:57:07.515]  That you run Bin Laden and that you love the destabilization of all these people brought in.
[01:57:07.515 --> 01:57:16.604]  I want to confirm, you need to know, they are trying to get the American people ready to attack you.
[01:57:16.604 --> 01:57:19.848]  What would you like to say to the American people about the propaganda they're hearing?
[01:57:20.618 --> 01:57:22.239]  Yes, this is total propaganda.
[01:57:22.239 --> 01:57:25.581]  This is fixing Pakistan, who has been a long time your friend.
[01:57:25.581 --> 01:57:36.829]  You are the sole superpower today because of Pakistan and because of the blood of the Awan people, whom you have, with impunity and with great callousness, you have destroyed them.
[01:57:36.829 --> 01:57:38.250]  Please don't do that.
[01:57:38.250 --> 01:57:40.011]  People of America are very good.
[01:57:40.011 --> 01:57:42.032]  They are very innocent.
[01:57:42.032 --> 01:57:50.158]  I think gullibility is acceptable to an extent, but please do not buy all the theories of these ambitious generals.
