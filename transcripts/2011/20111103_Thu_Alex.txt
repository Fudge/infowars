[00:00:05.356 --> 00:00:10.218]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.218 --> 00:00:11.778]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:13.319]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.319 --> 00:00:17.521]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.521 --> 00:00:21.602]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.558 --> 00:00:33.081]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[00:00:33.081 --> 00:00:34.202]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:34.202 --> 00:00:36.704]  It is 11-3-11, the third day of November 2011 on this Thursday transmission.
[00:00:36.704 --> 00:00:39.327]  And we are going to now broadcast for 27 hours.
[00:00:39.327 --> 00:00:39.807]  I will be here.
[00:00:50.524 --> 00:00:53.965]  I think what is it comes out to about 18 of those hours.
[00:00:53.965 --> 00:01:01.088]  We'll take a nap for about three or four hours in the middle of the night, but Aaron Dykes will be live.
[00:01:01.088 --> 00:01:02.688]  Paul Watson will be live.
[00:01:02.688 --> 00:01:05.129]  We have an incredible lineup of guests.
[00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.170]  This is our second annual 24-hour plus transmission.
[00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.591]  It was actually Jaren's idea.
[00:01:11.744 --> 00:01:34.603]  Last year and obviously we are having our fourth annual money bomb and I'm going to break down briefly coming up at the start of the next segment who's coming up in the next 27 hours and exactly why we're having a money bomb to try to fund the expansion of this operation obviously and what your previous support has gone towards predominantly.
[00:01:34.603 --> 00:01:36.405]  Also we are going to
[00:01:38.375 --> 00:01:56.408]  Be premiering the second part of the Charlotte Iserby interview the first part blew people away Getting into education the second part is skull and bones being exposed and So that is coming up in the lineup as well.
[00:01:56.408 --> 00:02:03.893]  There is just so much That we're gonna be doing here in the next 24 plus hours today into Friday
[00:02:06.874 --> 00:02:08.736]  And of course I woke up at 4 a.m.
[00:02:08.736 --> 00:02:13.522]  this morning after going to bed at about midnight and then couldn't go back to sleep till about...
[00:02:15.533 --> 00:02:16.654]  Seven for some reason.
[00:02:16.654 --> 00:02:18.655]  I usually am a good sleeper.
[00:02:18.655 --> 00:02:25.598]  And then I slept till about nine, hung out with my children some, and barely got here on time.
[00:02:25.598 --> 00:02:27.319]  So that's why you never see me growing.
[00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.100]  My hair is still wet.
[00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.202]  Actually, I tend to wake up, eat breakfast, hang out with the family, and then take a shower.
[00:02:33.202 --> 00:02:40.166]  I am certainly just now jumping in the saddle, and I guess that's good in a way, because I was just going to stay up once I got up at four.
[00:02:40.166 --> 00:02:42.527]  And I was like, no, I better try to go back to sleep.
[00:02:42.527 --> 00:02:43.308]  I'm about to be up.
[00:02:44.108 --> 00:03:10.055]  uh... here for uh... most of the day it's really easy to do this compared to what's the record filibuster it's it's from texas in the legislature over two days can't sit down can't go to the bathroom and can't eat and have to continually talk and cannot lean on anything people are like wow you're gonna broadcast eighteen hours out of twenty seven
[00:03:11.263 --> 00:03:15.205]  I guess more than that, because I'm going to do two hours of the three-hour show on Friday.
[00:03:15.205 --> 00:03:18.846]  I haven't done the math, so I guess it's more like 20 hours.
[00:03:18.846 --> 00:03:20.847]  That is a piece of cake!
[00:03:20.847 --> 00:03:31.511]  Now, where it gets tedious, though, is taking the calls, talking to the interesting guests, because I won't just be up here muttering, like a lot of filibusters do.
[00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:39.975]  I've got to really be thinking, and I'm intrigued, just like the audience is, on all the guests, so I'm listening, I'm thinking, and that's actually what's really, really tiring about it.
[00:03:41.024 --> 00:03:43.126]  He's going over all the news.
[00:03:43.126 --> 00:03:44.286]  Boy, it is wild.
[00:03:44.286 --> 00:03:53.193]  I've got like 10 articles here, mainstream news, where, and of course yesterday you saw Sky Television, London Guardian, Israel set to hit Iran.
[00:03:53.193 --> 00:03:55.414]  Netanyahu goes before the cabinet.
[00:03:55.414 --> 00:03:57.376]  He says he's getting ready to hit them.
[00:03:57.376 --> 00:03:58.917]  I don't know if they're going to attack.
[00:03:58.917 --> 00:04:02.219]  All I know is troops are massing in Kuwait.
[00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:07.342]  I've talked to a bunch of military on and off record who say the word they've got is Israel is going to strike.
[00:04:08.314 --> 00:04:11.016]  And they're set in the next few weeks to load that reactor.
[00:04:11.016 --> 00:04:15.339]  Now what I said, some of my folks said it could happen any time in the next two weeks.
[00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:18.942]  And by that I mean two weeks out, it could happen any time two weeks out.
[00:04:19.781 --> 00:04:19.961]  I think
[00:04:39.992 --> 00:04:53.683]  Iranian used car salesman in South Texas wanting to attack this Saudi ambassador and bombing at the embassy did turn out to be completely phony as a $3 bill.
[00:04:53.683 --> 00:04:56.725]  But still, we've got to talk about what this signifies.
[00:04:56.725 --> 00:04:57.666]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:05:01.775 --> 00:05:03.477]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:05:03.477 --> 00:05:08.782]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:05:08.782 --> 00:05:10.324]  Saving means to make money.
[00:05:10.324 --> 00:05:19.112]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:05:19.833 --> 00:05:27.378]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:05:27.378 --> 00:05:35.383]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:05:35.383 --> 00:05:40.606]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[00:05:40.606 --> 00:05:42.787]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.631]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:08.872]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:06:08.872 --> 00:06:13.673]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:06:13.673 --> 00:06:20.055]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:06:20.055 --> 00:06:22.296]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:06:22.776 --> 00:06:23.056]  Tim Geithner?
[00:06:23.056 --> 00:06:23.237]  Bernanke?
[00:06:23.237 --> 00:06:23.657]  They're arsonists!
[00:06:23.657 --> 00:06:24.318]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:06:24.318 --> 00:06:26.060]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:06:41.758 --> 00:06:43.880]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:49.023]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:06:49.023 --> 00:06:58.150]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv

[00:07:08.094 --> 00:07:12.136]  So now is the time to express the holiday spirit more than ever.

[00:08:01.003 --> 00:08:06.285]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.285 --> 00:08:08.567]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:19.597 --> 00:08:23.201]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:08:23.201 --> 00:08:25.824]  It is Thursday, 11-3-11.
[00:08:25.824 --> 00:08:27.666]  It is the third day of November, 2011.
[00:08:27.666 --> 00:08:30.189]  We're going to be live here for the next 27 hours.
[00:08:37.577 --> 00:08:38.737]  That's right.
[00:08:38.737 --> 00:08:46.720]  I will do at least 20 hours live here on air, but we also have Paul Watson sitting in for a few hours in the early morning hours.
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:47.960]  We have Aaron Dyche sitting in.
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:54.422]  We're going to premiere Skull & Bones expose with one of the only witnesses out there.
[00:08:54.422 --> 00:08:58.604]  We are going to have quite a transmission lined up for you.
[00:08:58.604 --> 00:09:00.904]  This is our second annual 27-hour transmission.
[00:09:03.465 --> 00:09:05.526]  Hour number one, I'm going to cover the news.
[00:09:05.526 --> 00:09:17.949]  Then we have historian and geopolitical researcher Joel Skousen joining us in the second hour to talk about Iran, the election, and so much more.
[00:09:17.949 --> 00:09:21.350]  Webster Griffin Tarpley will join us in the third hour.
[00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:36.935]  Catherine Albrecht, Dr. Catherine Albrecht will be joining us to talk about all these announcements to censor the internet, to restrict free speech, and this panoptagon of research control grid the government's put in place.
[00:09:36.935 --> 00:09:44.237]  Of course, the number two talk show host in the world, George Norrie will be joining us, host of Coast to Coast AM.
[00:09:44.237 --> 00:09:48.659]  David Icke will then be joining us coming up, so that's from 4 to 5.30.
[00:09:48.659 --> 00:09:49.099]  Then at 6 o'clock,
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:57.985]  We've got Mike Adams sitting in for my first break from 6 to 8 o'clock.
[00:09:57.985 --> 00:09:59.246]  Then I return.
[00:09:59.246 --> 00:10:01.948]  Alfred Adask will be joining us.
[00:10:01.948 --> 00:10:04.490]  And Mike Adams has got a bunch of guests lined up as well when he's on.
[00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:05.651]  He'll be in studio.
[00:10:05.651 --> 00:10:07.493]  We appreciate him doing that.
[00:10:07.493 --> 00:10:11.856]  Tex Mars is going to be popping in with us as well.
[00:10:13.143 --> 00:10:17.626]  At 10 o'clock tonight, that should be always interesting and informative.
[00:10:17.626 --> 00:10:24.631]  We also have Mr. Corbett of the Corbett Report, always informative and interesting, as well, is going to be joining us.
[00:10:24.631 --> 00:10:31.056]  Fritz Springmeier, fresh out of prison, now first breaking his silence here for being shut up for bank robbery.
[00:10:31.056 --> 00:10:34.418]  The author will be joining us coming up at 1 a.m.
[00:10:34.418 --> 00:10:35.119]  Central.
[00:10:35.119 --> 00:10:36.360]  All these times are central.
[00:10:37.221 --> 00:10:46.617]  Uh, and then of course, uh, we also then have Aaron Dykes from two to four, and he's got some guests and a bunch of premier videos he's going to be playing.
[00:10:46.617 --> 00:10:47.319]  Paul Watson.
[00:10:48.428 --> 00:10:48.608]  I don't
[00:11:09.306 --> 00:11:12.170]  We air the Izzard because that's what people want to see.
[00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:13.171]  Baggage is great as well.
[00:11:13.171 --> 00:11:17.938]  We can just put that up on PrisonPlanet.tv or premiere it on the news, Nightly News or something.
[00:11:17.938 --> 00:11:20.181]  Gerald Salente then joins us at 8 a.m.
[00:11:20.181 --> 00:11:21.763]  Central.
[00:11:21.763 --> 00:11:25.468]  Then we're working on Alan Watt, Jim Mars, and of course Bob Chapman.
[00:11:27.043 --> 00:11:30.665]  And I guess only one of these has question marks, and that's Alan Watt, but that'll probably come through.
[00:11:30.665 --> 00:11:33.167]  So, that's the only question mark on here.
[00:11:33.167 --> 00:11:37.550]  So, wow, what a lineup that we have.
[00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:45.995]  Great job to the crew getting this together, because these are incredible times that we live in.
[00:11:45.995 --> 00:11:49.918]  And unfortunately, our political analysis has been spot on.
[00:11:50.939 --> 00:11:55.181]  It's unfortunate in that we were right, because this is scary stuff.
[00:11:55.181 --> 00:11:56.662]  It's horrible.
[00:11:56.662 --> 00:11:57.563]  It's disgusting.
[00:11:57.563 --> 00:11:58.884]  It's dangerous.
[00:11:58.884 --> 00:12:01.305]  I would rather reality be different.
[00:12:01.305 --> 00:12:16.654]  We have a tyrannical, maniacal, eugenics-based, anti-human, anti-life culture and system and college and association and society of psychopathic control freaks
[00:12:19.605 --> 00:12:34.413]  Who are protected by a bunch of well-meaning idiots, compartmentalized fools, useful idiots, but also sociopaths, mercenaries, control freaks, scum, sadists, and others.
[00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:42.503]  And they are weaving a web, like a spider weaves a web, of control.
[00:12:42.503 --> 00:13:02.796]  The same web that tyrants and control freaks have woven throughout history, but now so much more disgusting and filthy, and the numbers of killed are much higher because the population is larger, and there's a technological overlay, there's a psychotronic overlay, a chemical overlay, a spiritual overlay, a psychological warfare overlay,
[00:13:04.016 --> 00:13:11.700]  From the flicker rates with the TVs, to the sodium fluoride in the water, and the Prozac in the water, and that's basically what fluoride is, as Ventura pointed out yesterday.
[00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:14.841]  I mean, it's just wild.
[00:13:14.841 --> 00:13:18.383]  Tyrants have always tried to fully dominate, and they've always failed.
[00:13:18.383 --> 00:13:24.345]  And they hate the fact that they can't turn us into slaves, biological androids.
[00:13:24.345 --> 00:13:25.926]  They don't want us to have free will.
[00:13:28.612 --> 00:13:30.575]  Now we got a lot of interesting news.
[00:13:30.575 --> 00:13:39.049]  The White House is being subpoenaed, as you know, over just legalizing illegal aliens, including felons, and not even deporting felons now.
[00:13:40.473 --> 00:13:50.959]  They're also being subpoenaed over the different energy companies that they publicly gave hundreds of millions, in some cases billions of dollars.
[00:13:50.959 --> 00:13:57.382]  It's billions in total, but 500 plus million to one of the main companies that is made up of his campaign contributors.
[00:13:57.382 --> 00:13:58.823]  They never basically built anything.
[00:13:58.823 --> 00:14:01.244]  It was just a complete scam.
[00:14:01.244 --> 00:14:03.946]  And why would they commit crimes of this magnitude?
[00:14:03.946 --> 00:14:09.389]  Because they know the rest of the government at the top is so corrupt that if anybody tries to actually bust them,
[00:14:10.748 --> 00:14:14.049]  They'll just rat them out for all the other issues.
[00:14:14.049 --> 00:14:18.972]  This is the corruption factor once it gets to a certain point.
[00:14:18.972 --> 00:14:26.255]  They also hold the rest of the system hostage because Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan and others control the derivatives, they control the social security.
[00:14:26.255 --> 00:14:29.356]  They run it all.
[00:14:29.356 --> 00:14:31.397]  They're now taking over the internet as we know it.
[00:14:31.397 --> 00:14:33.178]  They're now taking over free speech as we know it.
[00:14:33.178 --> 00:14:38.340]  This is a group of conscious criminals who have been told they can do whatever they want by their masters.
[00:14:39.321 --> 00:14:50.688]  And if the Republicans get uppity about Fast and Furious, they'll just expose government shipments of guns under Bush to Mexico, and narcotics shipped in that are already in federal court, and the feds have admitted it's true and we've covered it.
[00:14:50.688 --> 00:14:53.449]  El Paso Times Chicago Tribune.
[00:14:53.449 --> 00:15:02.255]  It is a group of absolute criminals blackmailing each other, and so when you reach that point, the sky is the limit.
[00:15:02.255 --> 00:15:04.316]  You know, I saw a cop car last night on 290, pushing
[00:15:08.737 --> 00:15:10.938]  They've got a little metal bumper, which is useful.
[00:15:10.938 --> 00:15:25.644]  Pushing, I slowed down even, make sure I was seeing what I was seeing, pushing some old man with a broke down pickup truck, looked like a pickup truck from the 60s, up the ramp, up out of the highway.
[00:15:25.644 --> 00:15:37.049]  Not calling a bunch of city trucks, not getting 20 bureaucrats out there to shut down the highway, pushing somebody's car up the ramp, up the road to the gas station at the top of the hill.
[00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:42.777]  I actually see police now more than I've seen in years.
[00:15:42.777 --> 00:15:44.920]  I used to see this all the time when I was a child.
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.325]  Changing people's tires.
[00:15:47.325 --> 00:15:49.268]  Helping them.
[00:15:49.268 --> 00:15:52.353]  Look, I know the average police officer is not a bad person.
[00:15:53.660 --> 00:16:03.030]  But I also know the system is trying to hire bad people, trying to train them to be corrupt, trying to train them that it's a tough guy to violate people's rights.
[00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:05.553]  In fact, I have an article right here.
[00:16:05.553 --> 00:16:06.995]  This is out of the Sacramento Bee.
[00:16:06.995 --> 00:16:09.057]  That's the major paper of Sacramento.
[00:16:09.057 --> 00:16:13.041]  If you guys give me a document cam shot, I'll show people this for PrisonPlanet.TV viewers.
[00:16:16.192 --> 00:16:19.314]  This is up on Infowars.com now.
[00:16:19.314 --> 00:16:42.246]  Controversial t-shirt puts Twin Rivers Police Department in the spotlight and it shows what looks like a five-year-old child, almost toddler-like, maybe four, four or five-year-old little boy looking out from a grimy prison cell with grimy bars and it says, you raise them, we cage them.
[00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:50.916]  This t-shirt is out of the Twin Rivers Police Officers Association.
[00:16:50.916 --> 00:16:53.721]  And it just shows the sick attitude.
[00:16:53.721 --> 00:16:59.150]  You know, I've heard the police radio transmissions that have made the news across the country where they talk about hunting people.
[00:17:00.819 --> 00:17:04.660]  And where they talk about all this, and it's this dehumanizing attitude.
[00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:09.702]  What police do to the rest of the public ends up coming back on them.
[00:17:09.702 --> 00:17:17.024]  It's like this retired police officer owns this big Trudy's down on Congress, and the city tried to shut it down.
[00:17:17.024 --> 00:17:24.867]  Gave him the permit to build the $150,000 giant deck, then said we're revoking it after it was built, and tried to harass him out of business.
[00:17:25.467 --> 00:17:28.149]  And then tried to send cops in to do stuff to him.
[00:17:28.149 --> 00:17:39.555]  Once they were suing him, my lawyers, the lawyer that sued him, Eric Taub, and won by the way, and now TAB has city people basically making little snide comments and little veiled comments to him.
[00:17:39.555 --> 00:17:43.278]  But that came back on you.
[00:17:43.278 --> 00:17:50.242]  This schizophrenic guy, who it later came out on the videos, what they're in a suburb of LA, didn't do anything to the police.
[00:17:51.805 --> 00:17:56.950]  They beat him to death and would do knee drops on his head over and over again for more than 10 minutes.
[00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:58.772]  He killed somebody with one of those.
[00:17:58.772 --> 00:18:00.513]  They killed him.
[00:18:00.513 --> 00:18:01.534]  Then tried to cover it up.
[00:18:01.534 --> 00:18:06.799]  Now the police did charge one of the cops with murder.
[00:18:06.799 --> 00:18:09.582]  One of them murder too, the other just basic murder.
[00:18:09.582 --> 00:18:15.107]  You know, the point is that
[00:18:17.645 --> 00:18:22.810]  They're selling you on macho-ness and on corruption and that it's tough and cool.
[00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:24.291]  It's not cool.
[00:18:24.291 --> 00:18:25.972]  It's not cool.
[00:18:25.972 --> 00:18:28.294]  With great power comes great responsibility.
[00:18:28.294 --> 00:18:30.576]  It's honorable to be a servant.
[00:18:30.576 --> 00:18:38.003]  It's honorable if somebody, you know, gets in your face to be in control.
[00:18:38.003 --> 00:18:42.307]  It's honorable to push an old man's truck up the road.
[00:18:42.907 --> 00:18:45.189]  Instead of just saying, I got better things to do.
[00:18:45.189 --> 00:18:48.932]  And see, government is trying to make it where police can't do things like that.
[00:18:48.932 --> 00:18:53.576]  All over the country, they've told police, it's come out in the news, don't respond to crime, go revenue generate.
[00:18:53.576 --> 00:18:57.679]  Don't help people, let them help themselves.
[00:18:57.679 --> 00:19:01.682]  Because they want the people separate from you.
[00:19:01.682 --> 00:19:04.985]  They want the people to see you as the enemy.
[00:19:04.985 --> 00:19:06.966]  Because they want us at each other's throats.
[00:19:06.966 --> 00:19:08.267]  When it's just common sense,
[00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:12.692]  That what happens in society affects police.
[00:19:12.692 --> 00:19:21.257]  You go to, your children go to the same schools as everybody else, same churches, same shopping malls, same shooting ranges, same lakes to go fishing.
[00:19:21.257 --> 00:19:26.581]  Do you want to live in a society with microphones in streetlights and with, they've now announced,
[00:19:27.441 --> 00:19:38.070]  In hotel rooms saying, watch your neighbor, don't trust anybody, and the hotel guests may be terrorists, and we need, it says paying with cash, suspicious, and spy on people's bags in their rooms.
[00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:40.312]  I mean, this is beyond the Soviet Union.
[00:19:40.312 --> 00:19:42.613]  I mean, is this, you really think we'll be safe?
[00:19:43.616 --> 00:19:45.418]  Look at the government at the top.
[00:19:45.418 --> 00:19:47.139]  They're a bunch of crooks.
[00:19:47.139 --> 00:19:50.803]  Only crooks set up governments like this.
[00:19:50.803 --> 00:19:55.267]  And people that work for the government have to ask themselves which side they're on.
[00:19:55.267 --> 00:19:55.788]  Stay with us.
[00:19:55.788 --> 00:19:56.989]  Big news coming up on Israel.

[00:21:50.367 --> 00:21:51.847]  The war is here.
[00:21:51.847 --> 00:21:53.748]  It's an info war.
[00:21:53.748 --> 00:21:55.508]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.

[00:22:31.119 --> 00:22:35.682]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:22:35.682 --> 00:22:41.486]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:22:41.486 --> 00:22:45.128]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[00:24:21.311 --> 00:24:23.832]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:23.832 --> 00:24:27.233]  It is Thursday, the third day of November, 2011.
[00:24:27.233 --> 00:24:34.134]  We're going to be live here for the next 27 hours if you just joined us.
[00:24:34.134 --> 00:24:35.315]  I'm going to get into the economy.
[00:24:35.315 --> 00:24:36.555]  I'm going to get into U.S.
[00:24:36.555 --> 00:24:37.995]  news, world news.
[00:24:37.995 --> 00:24:44.597]  I'm going to get into the incredible announcements by the Israeli government that they are getting ready to strike Iran.
[00:24:44.597 --> 00:24:46.938]  And I told you two and a half weeks ago that
[00:24:48.439 --> 00:24:53.563]  After the two-week period, I was saying any time after two weeks from now, they could strike.
[00:24:53.563 --> 00:25:02.270]  Because that's what my military sources have said, that's what Ray McGovern said, that's what Bob Baer said of the CIA, that's what all of these people came out and said.
[00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:09.735]  Of course, I was saying it the day before because I have sources, and Israel's trying to sell the idea of striking Iran.
[00:25:09.735 --> 00:25:13.338]  And so I think we should talk about what's going to probably happen if Iran is attacked.
[00:25:15.301 --> 00:25:16.723]  They've got polls in Israel.
[00:25:16.723 --> 00:25:19.385]  Some polls show 50-50 for and against.
[00:25:19.385 --> 00:25:22.448]  Some polls show 70 plus percent against.
[00:25:22.448 --> 00:25:24.350]  So it's not just monolithic in Israel.
[00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:32.537]  Netanyahu got rid of his Mossad chief, a bunch of other folks earlier in the year because they were saying they're not going along with it.
[00:25:32.537 --> 00:25:34.759]  Now why are they saying that?
[00:25:34.759 --> 00:25:39.603]  Why are people that are in Israel and in the government saying it's not a good idea?
[00:25:39.603 --> 00:25:41.145]  Why is the US government saying that?
[00:25:42.925 --> 00:25:46.969]  And again, our government's really the big megabanks.
[00:25:46.969 --> 00:25:48.010]  They're not against wars.
[00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:50.292]  They love to bomb stuff and take stuff over.
[00:25:50.292 --> 00:25:56.699]  It's because Iran, through proxies, is going to attack Israel on all sides.
[00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:05.623]  And the different sides have gotten high-tech weapons out of China and Russia.
[00:26:05.623 --> 00:26:17.869]  And three and a half years ago, you saw in Lebanon, and the Israelis, by the way, have gone back in there, quote, stop rockets, so there's already a force going in there to try to push back, you know, in case there's a full-on war.
[00:26:17.869 --> 00:26:27.714]  The Israeli tanks and troops got pushed back, got defeated, because the people they're fighting do have some high-tech weapons.
[00:26:29.042 --> 00:26:34.409]  They do have some anti-tank, shoulder-fired missiles, and other nasty things.
[00:26:34.409 --> 00:26:41.238]  And so, any way you slice it, the Strait of Hormuz getting closed, I'm going to talk more about it later.
[00:26:41.238 --> 00:26:45.624]  This is a very, very serious time.
[00:26:45.624 --> 00:26:47.086]  And for those of you still in denial,
[00:26:48.661 --> 00:27:01.871]  When neocon groups or pro-war groups or government operatives on the internet come out and attack myself and others and say they're lying, there's no way they're going to attack Iran, no one's saying this, it's crazy.
[00:27:01.871 --> 00:27:09.878]  I mean, I noticed two and a half weeks ago when I said the word is they're getting ready to hit Iran anytime from two weeks out.
[00:27:09.878 --> 00:27:12.460]  But they want to hit them before the winter comes the next few months.
[00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:13.981]  That's what all my guests concurred with me.
[00:27:16.095 --> 00:27:24.619]  I've never seen just so many internet attacks, media attacks, the usual suspect attacks, because they're getting the order.
[00:27:24.619 --> 00:27:37.265]  By the way, we see this all the time in the IP addresses, because we don't really moderate very much on InfoWars and Prison Planet in the comments, except for calls for violence or posting somebody's phone number, you know, and say, here's their house, go after them.
[00:27:37.265 --> 00:27:38.286]  We take stuff like that down.
[00:27:38.766 --> 00:27:45.475]  But Tim's been trying to get me to do a YouTube video or report about this and show the IP addresses.
[00:27:45.475 --> 00:27:51.343]  There'll be one person with 10 different identities having fake conversations with themselves.
[00:27:51.343 --> 00:27:53.325]  And it's all government tactics.
[00:27:53.325 --> 00:27:55.468]  So we kind of find it interesting as a laboratory.
[00:27:56.530 --> 00:28:09.865]  But I think I'm going to start showing the IP address and actually do some reports because they'll have, in ten different handles, conversations with themselves and then say, looks like people are waking up to Alex Jones being a fraud.
[00:28:11.158 --> 00:28:13.739]  And it's one guy posing as 10 people.
[00:28:13.739 --> 00:28:17.060]  That's government megaphone program, they call it.
[00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:18.500]  They also call it sock puppets.
[00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:20.901]  I mean, they've admitted for a decade the Pentagon does this.
[00:28:20.901 --> 00:28:23.522]  They have hundreds of PR firms hired to do it.
[00:28:23.522 --> 00:28:24.943]  And of course, we've got them after us.
[00:28:24.943 --> 00:28:28.364]  That's actually, you know, come out before.
[00:28:28.364 --> 00:28:34.626]  But wow, I mean, it is, it's actually still incredible to see them doing it.
[00:28:36.206 --> 00:28:37.927]  So we're going to do some reports on that soon.
[00:28:37.927 --> 00:28:43.412]  So come on trolls, come on in and show people because you're also illustrating this for everybody.
[00:28:43.412 --> 00:28:48.275]  People commenting on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, they see it too.
[00:28:48.275 --> 00:28:50.657]  They can tell by the writing style.
[00:28:50.657 --> 00:28:58.684]  And I've done this for years and I don't know why I haven't done a report on it because it's very interesting to see one person posing as as many as 20 people sometimes.
[00:28:59.284 --> 00:29:09.777]  But they'll use different, and all the same IP addresses, which is that's what we, you know, at a certain point we're like, all right, this person has 20 identities and they're, and they're, you know, they're spewing racism all day.
[00:29:11.050 --> 00:29:13.552]  Alex is great because he hates black people.
[00:29:13.552 --> 00:29:17.816]  They'll say stuff like that so people who come to the site feel like they're not wanted there if they're black.
[00:29:17.816 --> 00:29:19.278]  It's all divide and conquer.
[00:29:19.278 --> 00:29:20.539]  It's all these tricks.
[00:29:20.539 --> 00:29:22.040]  It's all these things.
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:30.968]  But I saw the biggest push ever that I've ever seen in Cointelpro and Desinfo when I came out two and a half weeks ago and said,
[00:29:33.268 --> 00:29:37.831]  I guess it was October 13th, and said they've green-lighted an attack on Iran.
[00:29:37.831 --> 00:29:50.180]  Now, of course, you have the news today, Israel considers preemptive attack on Iran, Netanyahu goes before Knesset, says he wants to attack, Israel test-fires missile, it's all over the news, they're gonna probably attack.
[00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:54.102]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.102 --> 00:29:56.784]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.902 --> 00:30:09.006]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:30:09.006 --> 00:30:11.568]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:30:11.568 --> 00:30:16.950]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:19.992]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:30:19.992 --> 00:30:22.053]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:30:22.293 --> 00:30:28.557]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:30:28.557 --> 00:30:31.919]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:30:31.919 --> 00:30:37.702]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:30:37.702 --> 00:30:39.343]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:30:39.343 --> 00:30:40.644]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:30:40.644 --> 00:30:43.326]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:30:43.326 --> 00:30:47.548]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:30:47.548 --> 00:30:50.130]  You can find the video at www dot
[00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:52.151]  End of America 3.com.

[00:31:01.734 --> 00:31:03.434]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:31:03.434 --> 00:31:08.756]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:31:08.756 --> 00:31:10.276]  Saving means to make money.
[00:31:10.276 --> 00:31:19.059]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:31:19.799 --> 00:31:27.345]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:31:27.345 --> 00:31:35.351]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:31:35.351 --> 00:31:40.574]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[00:32:01.641 --> 00:32:06.343]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[00:32:06.343 --> 00:32:12.765]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[00:32:12.765 --> 00:32:15.046]  Number one, study the past.
[00:32:15.046 --> 00:32:17.427]  History really does repeat itself.
[00:32:17.427 --> 00:32:21.149]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[00:32:22.290 --> 00:32:25.372]  Number three, take decisive action.
[00:32:25.372 --> 00:32:29.215]  A perfect storm is brewing for a global food crisis.
[00:32:29.215 --> 00:32:38.281]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves, warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[00:32:38.281 --> 00:32:41.684]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[00:32:41.684 --> 00:32:45.326]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:32:46.167 --> 00:32:51.090]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[00:32:51.090 --> 00:32:55.713]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:32:55.713 --> 00:32:58.435]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:33:25.798 --> 00:33:36.784]  Rusted chains of prison moons are shattered by the sun.
[00:33:36.784 --> 00:33:43.707]  I walk a road, horizons change, the tournament's begun.
[00:33:43.707 --> 00:33:48.770]  The purple piper plays his tune, the choir softly sings.
[00:33:50.919 --> 00:33:55.990]  Lullabies in an ancient song for the court of the Crimson King.
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:07.801]  We are live.
[00:34:07.801 --> 00:34:08.382]  It is 11-3-11.
[00:34:08.382 --> 00:34:10.684]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:34:10.684 --> 00:34:19.473]  I'm going to mention again the unbelievably powerful lineup of guests and information that we have coming up today.
[00:34:19.473 --> 00:34:30.485]  I want to go back through that list for people that are just now joining us here in a moment.
[00:34:36.297 --> 00:34:55.489]  Now, continuing here with the situation in Israel, the fact that the system tried to come out and say that that used car salesman, marijuana dealer, was going to blow up the Saudi embassy in D.C.
[00:34:58.717 --> 00:35:17.305]  The fact that it later came out even in mainstream news but buried in the newspaper that it was anti-Iranian government opposition groups that were in contact with him and Mexican drug cartels and all of these former and current government experts came out and said this is phony, this is an excuse to attack Iran.
[00:35:17.305 --> 00:35:19.946]  That's what was happening two and a half weeks ago.
[00:35:19.946 --> 00:35:25.769]  As troops are moved into Kuwait, as the buildup happens, as our military bases go on secret alert,
[00:35:27.754 --> 00:35:33.058]  And now Netanyahu goes before the Knesset yesterday and says, I want to hit them.
[00:35:33.058 --> 00:35:38.522]  Last Friday, Washington Times reports they've done the prisoner exchange to get rid of their Palestinian prisoners.
[00:35:38.522 --> 00:35:42.745]  Give up a thousand of them for one Israeli soldier.
[00:35:42.745 --> 00:35:45.628]  All of this is going on.
[00:35:45.628 --> 00:35:49.831]  All of this is happening right now.
[00:35:52.361 --> 00:35:53.702]  In a game of brinksmanship.
[00:35:53.702 --> 00:35:55.923]  They're coming in with more sanctions against Iran.
[00:35:55.923 --> 00:36:06.350]  Iran is scheduled in the next two weeks to load and fuel their reactors and to start purifying uranium.
[00:36:06.350 --> 00:36:21.961]  Now the UN inspectors have been there and they've said that they can't make weapons with this grade, but there's reportedly coming out next week an IAEA, International Atomic Energy Agency, report saying that Iran is secretly making fissile material.
[00:36:23.202 --> 00:36:26.664]  And Russia and China are protesting saying the report is a fraud.
[00:36:26.664 --> 00:36:28.266]  That was in the news last night and today.
[00:36:28.266 --> 00:36:31.708]  This is all happening right now.
[00:36:31.708 --> 00:36:34.851]  You've got the fake report of the guy wanting to blow up the Saudi embassy.
[00:36:36.243 --> 00:36:40.246]  And you had Congressman King and others saying, hit Iran.
[00:36:40.246 --> 00:36:41.206]  It's on.
[00:36:41.206 --> 00:36:43.068]  So stop living in denial.
[00:36:43.068 --> 00:36:48.191]  Why would the government COINTELPRO want to come out and say there's no danger of Iran being hit?
[00:36:48.191 --> 00:36:49.112]  Shut up.
[00:36:49.112 --> 00:36:50.333]  It's not happening.
[00:36:50.333 --> 00:36:51.474]  It's all made up.
[00:36:51.474 --> 00:36:55.516]  Even now, as the Israelis, and they were doing this two and a half weeks ago.
[00:36:55.516 --> 00:36:59.259]  Panetta, the Defense Secretary, came back and said they're getting ready to hit.
[00:36:59.259 --> 00:37:00.240]  They're probably going to hit them.
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:01.941]  They're totally diplomatically isolated.
[00:37:03.985 --> 00:37:10.611]  The Washington Times, who's pro-war, talks to insiders last Friday and says Netanyahu wants to be seen as Churchill.
[00:37:10.611 --> 00:37:12.813]  He's politically a dead duck right now.
[00:37:12.813 --> 00:37:14.074]  He's not going to get re-elected.
[00:37:14.074 --> 00:37:15.356]  This will get him re-elected.
[00:37:17.113 --> 00:37:25.220]  And they're all right here in the news, and again, it's not that I get lied about and people say, oh, you know, Jones is crazy just making it up that there's probably going to be an attack on Iran.
[00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:33.888]  I said the green light's been given, it's going to happen unless we expose this plot as a fraud of this Iranian car salesman in South Texas to do all this.
[00:37:33.888 --> 00:37:38.312]  Unless this is proven as a fraud now, they're going to use this to attack.
[00:37:38.312 --> 00:37:40.133]  And sure enough, it got proven as a fraud.
[00:37:40.133 --> 00:37:42.475]  So see, the government's doing two things here.
[00:37:42.475 --> 00:37:43.917]  The fact that I get attacked on this,
[00:37:45.717 --> 00:37:51.098]  It's not that it worries me that I'm being attacked over it, it shows me just how accurate we are.
[00:37:51.098 --> 00:37:58.620]  That they don't want Americans having a debate about the worst war yet of the five wars going on.
[00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:08.302]  So it's just, it's a military tactic, like when they're ramming into the Branch Davidians Church with those tanks and saying this is not an assault, come out with your hands up, and they ran out and they mowed them down.
[00:38:08.302 --> 00:38:12.883]  We have the flare footage of the guys behind the tanks in an infantry tactic just shooting them.
[00:38:13.882 --> 00:38:27.622]  And then running over their bodies and then bulldozing them with a Bradley fighting vehicle with a scoop on the front later back into the fire and the ATF and army posing with skulls and all the rest of it and blowing the little kids up inside the church records vault.
[00:38:28.894 --> 00:38:31.916]  That's the tactic, is we are not assaulting.
[00:38:31.916 --> 00:38:34.458]  So we're like, hey, you're getting troops ready.
[00:38:34.458 --> 00:38:37.480]  Israel's saying in their newspapers they're getting ready to hit.
[00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:37.760]  The U.S.
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:40.422]  is saying Israel don't attack.
[00:38:40.422 --> 00:38:44.025]  And they're moving troops into Kuwait, telling them there's about to be an attack.
[00:38:44.585 --> 00:38:49.847]  And now you've staged this thing saying Iran was going to do this, clearly as a fake provocation.
[00:38:49.847 --> 00:38:52.048]  Hey folks, they're green lighting the attack.
[00:38:52.048 --> 00:38:53.828]  We better get the word out and stop it.
[00:38:53.828 --> 00:39:03.092]  They want to deny this is getting ready to happen so you don't politically put pressure on Washington to stop this.
[00:39:03.092 --> 00:39:06.613]  They don't want to debate about hitting Iran or not hitting Iran.
[00:39:06.613 --> 00:39:07.973]  They just want us out of the game.
[00:39:07.973 --> 00:39:09.694]  They don't want Americans having a debate.
[00:39:10.919 --> 00:39:15.762]  Because we've already come three times in the last six, seven years within an inch.
[00:39:15.762 --> 00:39:31.553]  In 2007, Dick Cheney, now on record, and he admits it in his new book, ordered Fox Fallon, the head of CENTCOM, to attack, to attack, let's say this again, to attack Iran, and he didn't do it and had to resign.
[00:39:32.293 --> 00:39:35.934]  Then Cheney wanted to paint up blue patrol boats to attack U.S.
[00:39:35.934 --> 00:39:38.755]  ships there in the Gulf as a pretext.
[00:39:38.755 --> 00:39:39.936]  This has all come out.
[00:39:39.936 --> 00:39:41.436]  And the government said no again.
[00:39:41.436 --> 00:39:43.957]  So they're always trying to get this war going.
[00:39:43.957 --> 00:39:44.998]  Always trying.
[00:39:44.998 --> 00:39:46.918]  Iran's almost 80 million people.
[00:39:46.918 --> 00:39:49.639]  They've got a lot more high-tech weapons than Iraq had.
[00:39:49.639 --> 00:39:56.662]  They weren't under decades and decades of sanctions and inspectors all over their country for 15 years and a bombed-out nation.
[00:39:58.507 --> 00:39:59.748]  And it is going to wreak havoc.
[00:39:59.748 --> 00:40:02.089]  I mean, they're going to block the Strait of Hormuz.
[00:40:02.089 --> 00:40:03.671]  Oil prices are going to explode.
[00:40:03.671 --> 00:40:09.855]  It's going to be a political diversion for the banksters to steal more rights and more money and set up checkpoints.
[00:40:09.855 --> 00:40:14.097]  They're going to use the Iranian war threat to start setting up the domestic checkpoints.
[00:40:14.097 --> 00:40:23.504]  Notice they're rolling out the EAS takeover alert in November 9th.
[00:40:23.504 --> 00:40:28.167]  First time ever FEMA and Homeland Security totally take over the media, whether you like it or not.
[00:40:31.508 --> 00:40:40.654]  Notice they've got the TV ads, the PSAs, all the stuff rolling, TSA popping up on the street corners, telling you, we're surveilling you.
[00:40:40.654 --> 00:40:44.697]  This is all being geared up and prepared for something big.
[00:40:44.697 --> 00:40:51.702]  But the globalists aren't going to move with this plan if we have a debate about it and talk about it and point out how it's all a setup.
[00:40:52.202 --> 00:40:56.884]  So, they just want to treat us like we're idiots and say there's no talk about hitting Iran.
[00:40:56.884 --> 00:41:00.485]  Anybody that says we're going to hit Iran is a crazy conspiracy theorist.
[00:41:00.485 --> 00:41:07.487]  But wait a minute, Netanyahu's before the Knesset saying he's getting ready to hit and he's trying to get their support because it's a pretty big deal.
[00:41:07.487 --> 00:41:08.688]  No, he's not, Alex.
[00:41:08.688 --> 00:41:10.048]  Shut up, conspiracy theorist.
[00:41:10.048 --> 00:41:11.889]  But wait, I have AP.
[00:41:11.889 --> 00:41:13.349]  I have Sky.
[00:41:13.349 --> 00:41:18.931]  I have London Guardian.
[00:41:18.931 --> 00:41:20.152]  They all say they're getting ready to hit.
[00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:28.897]  Right here, I was right again that they're moving to, they're like, no, Iran doesn't even exist.
[00:41:28.897 --> 00:41:33.802]  I mean, I mean, that's basically the mind game they play with us.
[00:41:33.802 --> 00:41:36.565]  And that's what really scares me.
[00:41:36.565 --> 00:41:44.032]  Is if I would have come out two and a half weeks ago and said they're green lighting an attack on Iran, anytime, you know, two weeks out and then on from that point.
[00:41:47.535 --> 00:41:50.838]  If I wasn't credible, the system wouldn't even care.
[00:41:50.838 --> 00:41:53.741]  That's why I'm... We know they're getting ready to hit him now.
[00:41:53.741 --> 00:41:54.762]  I mean, they're admitting it.
[00:41:54.762 --> 00:41:56.063]  We know we've been proven right.
[00:41:56.063 --> 00:42:02.249]  So it's that we're so right, we're so accurate, we have our finger on the pulse of the geopolitical system.
[00:42:02.249 --> 00:42:05.772]  That's why we're bad.
[00:42:05.772 --> 00:42:08.135]  That's why we have to be demonized.
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:09.200]  U.K.
[00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:13.382]  military steps up plans for Iran attack amid fresh nuclear fears.
[00:42:13.382 --> 00:42:15.903]  And what do they say at the end of the Sky Television article?
[00:42:15.903 --> 00:42:16.604]  It says U.S.
[00:42:16.604 --> 00:42:18.825]  troops are being moved into Kuwait.
[00:42:18.825 --> 00:42:22.847]  As I told you two and a half weeks ago, it was not in the news at that time.
[00:42:22.847 --> 00:42:28.189]  I even told you they were going to try the invasion against Qaddafi, NATO-backed, in September, October.
[00:42:28.189 --> 00:42:29.990]  And of course it happened.
[00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:31.271]  Because I had military sources.
[00:42:32.148 --> 00:42:33.429]  And then you saw that happen.
[00:42:33.429 --> 00:42:37.954]  And then it got spun back and they said, Alex is crazy, US troops are never on the ground.
[00:42:37.954 --> 00:42:39.736]  They were admittedly on the ground.
[00:42:39.736 --> 00:42:42.239]  See, Obama says US troops are never on the ground.
[00:42:43.251 --> 00:42:43.611]  You know why?
[00:42:43.611 --> 00:42:45.852]  Because they were under NATO flag.
[00:42:45.852 --> 00:42:49.594]  It's like saying our troops weren't in Bosnia, it was a UN operation.
[00:42:49.594 --> 00:42:51.334]  You see these little semantic games?
[00:42:51.334 --> 00:42:55.196]  It's kind of like Napolitano is now saying, I didn't perjure myself on Fast and Furious.
[00:42:55.196 --> 00:42:57.957]  We didn't call it that then, we called it Gunrunner.
[00:42:57.957 --> 00:43:02.879]  So I didn't lie when I said I didn't know about Fast and Furious, because we weren't calling it that yet.
[00:43:03.499 --> 00:43:04.920]  I knew about Gunrunner.
[00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:07.361]  But they said, you did this Gunrunning Fast and Furious.
[00:43:07.361 --> 00:43:08.702]  I know nothing about Gunrunning.
[00:43:08.702 --> 00:43:09.683]  Then she gets caught.
[00:43:09.683 --> 00:43:12.264]  Oh, I meant, I knew about Project Gunrunner.
[00:43:12.264 --> 00:43:13.765]  I didn't know about Fast and Furious.
[00:43:13.765 --> 00:43:14.806]  Same program.
[00:43:14.806 --> 00:43:15.867]  They just gave it another name.
[00:43:15.867 --> 00:43:20.089]  They play these games with you like you're an idiot.
[00:43:20.089 --> 00:43:25.773]  Because it does scare the system that we've got our hand on the pulse so closely.
[00:43:25.773 --> 00:43:27.614]  That we know what they're doing.
[00:43:27.614 --> 00:43:30.816]  I saw articles attacking us eight months ago.
[00:43:31.843 --> 00:43:40.985]  When we were predicting that they would use a ground rebel force in Libya next, and then call those the legitimate government and back it up with a NATO attack.
[00:43:40.985 --> 00:43:44.126]  I saw our articles in my videos, where was it?
[00:43:44.126 --> 00:43:58.669]  I think it was on Little Green Football, one of the neocon sites, attacking me at the time going, look at this loon saying they're going to attack through proxies, Libya, and then exactly what I said happened.
[00:43:59.568 --> 00:44:03.913]  That scares the system that I know what they're up to.
[00:44:03.913 --> 00:44:15.025]  Spending dozens of hours every day with all these top experts and guests, reading hundreds of news articles a day, poring over data and history and strategies and proxy warfare.
[00:44:15.025 --> 00:44:16.306]  Obviously, this is not hard.
[00:44:16.306 --> 00:44:20.050]  It's all telegraphed.
[00:44:20.050 --> 00:44:21.251]  Okay, let's continue here now.
[00:44:22.786 --> 00:44:30.891]  You have just joined us during the kickoff of the 27-hour marathon transmission, second annual marathon transmission.
[00:44:30.891 --> 00:44:35.353]  I want to ask all listeners to go to InfoWars.com.
[00:44:35.353 --> 00:44:39.135]  In fact, we'll put this on screen.
[00:44:39.135 --> 00:44:48.521]  If you go to InfoWars.com, you will see there in the featured news area a link
[00:44:49.642 --> 00:44:50.984]  I need to restart my computer in here.
[00:44:50.984 --> 00:44:52.426]  I don't think it's been restarted in a week or two.
[00:44:52.426 --> 00:44:53.769]  It's just not working.
[00:44:53.769 --> 00:44:55.091]  So I'm unable to use my computer.
[00:44:55.091 --> 00:44:56.373]  I need somebody to fix that for me.
[00:44:56.373 --> 00:44:57.474]  If you can, thank you.
[00:44:57.474 --> 00:44:59.157]  Or during the break, I can run over and do it, I guess.
[00:44:59.157 --> 00:45:00.179]  Great.
[00:45:03.092 --> 00:45:07.635]  But the point I'm here making is, if you go to InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com, that's the best place to find it.
[00:45:07.635 --> 00:45:09.977]  I was trying to tell you on InfoWars where it's at.
[00:45:09.977 --> 00:45:11.177]  Yeah, there's InfoWars.com.
[00:45:11.177 --> 00:45:20.344]  Scroll down, and then there's a link there that says InfoWars launches 24-hour plus offensive against tyranny.
[00:45:20.344 --> 00:45:31.631]  And if you scroll down there, you see our video feed of the next 27 hours, and then you see our other backup, and then you see our Justin.TV, and you see our Ustream and other systems.
[00:45:31.631 --> 00:45:32.252]  And we've had
[00:45:33.622 --> 00:45:37.005]  Over a million people in one day before tune into the free streams.
[00:45:37.005 --> 00:45:42.931]  In a three day period we had 3.5 million during our Bilderberg coverage.
[00:45:42.931 --> 00:45:45.594]  And obviously our servers can't handle millions of people tuning in.
[00:45:45.594 --> 00:45:51.520]  So if our servers go down, if those top links go down, you'll be able to watch on Justin.TV and Ustream and other areas.
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:56.665]  Though we did crash Justin.TV during that Bilderberg coverage in June.
[00:45:58.914 --> 00:46:00.615]  So that is all available there.
[00:46:00.615 --> 00:46:02.935]  Please get that link and share it with everyone.
[00:46:02.935 --> 00:46:07.297]  But really, the easiest place to find it is InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[00:46:07.297 --> 00:46:13.139]  You go to InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com, you see Live Feed 1, Live Feed 2, Live Feed 3.
[00:46:14.622 --> 00:46:17.223]  And then we have backup feeds under that.
[00:46:17.223 --> 00:46:24.966]  And you can check out the entire transmission right there and all these guests that are coming up.
[00:46:24.966 --> 00:46:25.946]  And who's coming up?
[00:46:25.946 --> 00:46:31.389]  Joel Skousen of World Affairs Brief to break down Iran, the economy, give us his view on that.
[00:46:31.389 --> 00:46:34.150]  Webster Griffin Tarpley, geopolitical expert, will also be joining us.
[00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:34.890]  Katherine Albrecht,
[00:46:35.350 --> 00:46:39.073]  George Norrie, the icon, number two talk show host in the world.
[00:46:39.073 --> 00:46:41.355]  David Icke, needs no introduction.
[00:46:41.355 --> 00:46:46.518]  Mike Adams will then 5 to 7 central, sit in with a bunch of guests coming up so I can get a break.
[00:46:46.518 --> 00:46:49.621]  Then we have Alfred Adash joining us, always amazing.
[00:46:49.621 --> 00:46:51.182]  Tex Mars.
[00:46:51.182 --> 00:46:53.664]  We have Mr. Corbett joining us, always informative.
[00:46:54.484 --> 00:46:58.986]  We've got Fritz Springmeier fresh out of being a political prisoner joining us.
[00:46:58.986 --> 00:47:01.968]  Aaron Dykes then sits in for a couple hours, two to four.
[00:47:01.968 --> 00:47:05.010]  He's got some guests as well that are going to be very informative.
[00:47:05.010 --> 00:47:06.770]  Paul Watson then sits in for a couple hours.
[00:47:06.770 --> 00:47:07.911]  Then Richard Reeves.
[00:47:07.911 --> 00:47:13.614]  Then I'm back at 7 a.m., so I'll do 20 hours out of 27.
[00:47:13.614 --> 00:47:16.175]  And this says we're going to do the Begich video.
[00:47:16.175 --> 00:47:18.977]  No, I told him I want to do, told him I want to do Izzerby.
[00:47:19.696 --> 00:47:23.238]  Baggage is great, but this Isserby is breaking stuff.
[00:47:23.238 --> 00:47:24.659]  We may do the baggage later if we have time.
[00:47:24.659 --> 00:47:25.919]  That's a premiere video.
[00:47:25.919 --> 00:47:28.401]  Then Gerald Cilente joins me live.
[00:47:28.401 --> 00:47:29.641]  Then Alan Watt.
[00:47:29.641 --> 00:47:29.821]  Then...
[00:47:31.468 --> 00:47:33.530]  Jim Mars and then Bob Chapman.
[00:47:33.530 --> 00:47:37.733]  So you talk about powerful 27-hour transmission.
[00:47:37.733 --> 00:47:49.183]  And if you're listening on AM and FM and want to be able to watch the show as well, just go to InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com or InfoWars.com to find those free audio and video feeds.
[00:47:49.183 --> 00:47:52.466]  Also, you can get 15 days free at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[00:47:52.466 --> 00:47:54.467]  Free trial subscription.
[00:47:54.467 --> 00:47:58.651]  And your memberships also support this truly alternative grassroots media organization.
[00:48:00.532 --> 00:48:02.694]  Now let me tell you why we're doing this money bomb.
[00:48:02.694 --> 00:48:05.617]  It's really elementary.
[00:48:05.617 --> 00:48:14.587]  It was listeners four years ago that had the idea for money bombs that helped move us into this bigger operation, buy more equipment, and spurred me to go to the next level.
[00:48:14.587 --> 00:48:18.611]  And by doing that, we've been able to radically expand
[00:48:21.169 --> 00:48:22.930]  Our reach.
[00:48:22.930 --> 00:48:27.452]  Four years ago I was probably reaching five and a half, six million people a week total.
[00:48:27.452 --> 00:48:29.193]  It's 15 million conservatively.
[00:48:29.193 --> 00:48:31.714]  That's extremely conservative.
[00:48:31.714 --> 00:48:35.576]  15 million people a week.
[00:48:35.576 --> 00:48:37.156]  15 million.
[00:48:37.156 --> 00:48:42.319]  I have films seen online with over 35 million views per film.
[00:48:42.319 --> 00:48:43.239]  35 million.
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:47.581]  Who else is at this level?
[00:48:47.581 --> 00:48:50.523]  Who else is opposing the globalists at this level?
[00:48:50.523 --> 00:48:51.904]  Who else is exposing them?
[00:48:51.904 --> 00:48:54.765]  Who else understands them?
[00:48:54.765 --> 00:49:02.649]  Who else has this incredible spectrum of guests with different perspectives so you can come to your own decision like I did?
[00:49:02.649 --> 00:49:03.710]  Who else?
[00:49:03.710 --> 00:49:06.352]  We have to go to the next level and we have to be strong.
[00:49:06.352 --> 00:49:08.693]  In case, knock on wood, we get sued.
[00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:13.722]  In case I get killed or imprisoned, this operation's got to continue.
[00:49:13.722 --> 00:49:18.043]  I'm trying to groom the reporters, the researchers, the people that know what they're doing.
[00:49:18.043 --> 00:49:20.424]  I've got a plan in place if something happens to me.
[00:49:20.424 --> 00:49:23.666]  Believe me, I take the threat serious.
[00:49:23.666 --> 00:49:26.767]  These are criminals we're fighting.
[00:49:26.767 --> 00:49:28.368]  So, it's very simple.
[00:49:28.368 --> 00:49:31.449]  And we've got some reserve backup capital.
[00:49:33.015 --> 00:49:44.361]  To try to run this operation regardless, but to hire a couple of reporters and a second line of people to help us on the nightly news show.
[00:49:44.361 --> 00:49:46.522]  And I quite frankly, we need one more person on the radio area.
[00:49:46.522 --> 00:49:48.863]  We got two people, but when emergencies come up, we're shorthanded.
[00:49:48.863 --> 00:49:50.263]  We got one person right now.
[00:49:50.263 --> 00:49:52.765]  And we're gonna do that too.
[00:49:52.765 --> 00:49:54.105]  We're gonna get one more person on the radio.
[00:49:54.105 --> 00:49:54.586]  We need that.
[00:49:54.586 --> 00:49:56.807]  I'm making that decision right now.
[00:49:56.807 --> 00:49:58.828]  But the issue is that
[00:50:00.262 --> 00:50:04.064]  We need to get the personnel, we need some equipment, and so we're trying to raise $500,000.
[00:50:04.064 --> 00:50:12.689]  Sounds like a lot when you're running a big operation, when you actually run something with 30-plus people, you find out it's not jack squat.
[00:50:12.689 --> 00:50:15.510]  It's a lot, though, for a country falling apart.
[00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:24.515]  But look, when you give to Ron Paul and you give to alternative media, when you buy organic food, you are voting with your dollars.
[00:50:24.515 --> 00:50:26.736]  And other revolutionaries rob banks.
[00:50:28.847 --> 00:50:29.227]  I don't
[00:50:41.198 --> 00:50:46.120]  Get the public to give to all their anti-gun charities and things and to NPR and things.
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:47.680]  Why shouldn't we?
[00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:48.260]  That's another thing.
[00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:51.861]  They don't like me talking about a strike on Iran and they hate this money bomb.
[00:50:51.861 --> 00:50:53.562]  Not just because of Alex Jones.
[00:50:53.562 --> 00:51:00.864]  They don't like the idea of people giving to patriot political causes because if you did give across the board, we'd beat these people.
[00:51:01.244 --> 00:51:06.626]  Do you know which 37 crucial food items are going to fly off the shelves when the next disaster hits?
[00:51:06.626 --> 00:51:13.009]  If you don't, you and your family may be without food and waiting in long food lines after a big disaster strikes.
[00:51:13.009 --> 00:51:17.851]  You would be surprised how many people don't have these food items right now!
[00:51:17.851 --> 00:51:27.495]  123SurvivalPlan.com has set up a for patriots only video with inside information on the 37 food items that will sell out first when the next disaster strikes.
[00:51:27.495 --> 00:51:29.876]  The video on 123SurvivalPlan.com
[00:51:30.456 --> 00:51:31.077]  We're good to go.
[00:51:57.560 --> 00:51:59.941]  Again, that's 123survivalplan.com.

[00:53:45.992 --> 00:53:51.117]  Go to instafire.com spelled I-N-S-T-A fire dot com or call 888-482-4868.
[00:53:51.117 --> 00:53:51.378]  That's 888-482-4868.
[00:53:51.378 --> 00:53:51.478]  Safe.
[00:53:51.478 --> 00:53:51.758]  Simple.
[00:53:51.758 --> 00:53:52.059]  Versatile.
[00:53:52.059 --> 00:53:52.559]  Instafire.
[00:54:10.379 --> 00:54:12.983]  Yeah, we're good.
[00:54:27.383 --> 00:54:29.325]  Now we are live, ladies and gentlemen!
[00:54:29.325 --> 00:54:30.846]  I am fired up!
[00:54:30.846 --> 00:54:34.149]  Getting ready for this 27-hour transmission!
[00:54:34.149 --> 00:54:40.794]  Joel Skelton coming up to break down his perspective, his view on world events.
[00:54:40.794 --> 00:54:43.917]  Then we got Webster Tarpley joining us and a lot more today.
[00:54:43.917 --> 00:54:52.364]  But getting back to this money bomb, the idea, the idea of people giving, the idea of people all in,
[00:54:53.328 --> 00:55:01.895]  Like, you know, my mother's side of the family, William Ayers, selling his land in New York and buying a ship full of Bibles, very expensive.
[00:55:01.895 --> 00:55:13.223]  He was a wealthy man and coming to Texas to preach the gospel, but he believed in protestantism as a protestant because he didn't like the fact that everybody was being forced to convert to Catholicism.
[00:55:14.204 --> 00:55:18.528]  Help create Texas today, and I'm not getting into some Catholic-Protestant fight here.
[00:55:18.528 --> 00:55:21.290]  I'm just saying history's made by people that take action.
[00:55:21.290 --> 00:55:23.492]  History's made by people that step into the gap.
[00:55:23.492 --> 00:55:25.513]  People who step up and take action.
[00:55:25.513 --> 00:55:30.217]  And that's what I've done in the last 17 years.
[00:55:30.217 --> 00:55:34.821]  And I want to thank all of you that have donated at Infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[00:55:34.821 --> 00:55:35.662]  We've raised over $60,000 now.
[00:55:35.662 --> 00:55:38.604]  We need to get all the way up to $500,000 by the end of the show tomorrow in this 27-hour
[00:55:43.268 --> 00:55:52.893]  Transmission Money Bomb to be able to continue to expand our operation at the levels we need to and to buy the equipment we need to.
[00:55:52.893 --> 00:55:59.135]  Go watch the videos of what we've built in the last three and a half, four years, thanks to your support.
[00:55:59.135 --> 00:56:07.239]  It allowed us to not gamble as much and to be able, by gamble I mean hire people and then go bankrupt.
[00:56:07.239 --> 00:56:10.541]  It allowed us to grow and to be safe about that growth.
[00:56:11.381 --> 00:56:14.866]  Because I don't want to be reckless with this operation.
[00:56:14.866 --> 00:56:15.187]  Okay?
[00:56:15.187 --> 00:56:21.816]  Because it's such an important research facility, a system for reaching out to people.
[00:56:22.935 --> 00:56:26.097]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:56:26.097 --> 00:56:29.199]  You can support us by getting a PrisonPlanet.TV membership.
[00:56:29.199 --> 00:56:32.742]  You get 15 days, anyways right now, free.
[00:56:32.742 --> 00:56:35.904]  You support us by going to InfoWorksMoneyBomb and donating.
[00:56:35.904 --> 00:56:47.552]  Again, think about the fact that NPR gets up there, though it's government-funded and Rockefeller-funded, listen to who funds it, and then they also beg for money three or four times a year, every day.
[00:56:48.849 --> 00:56:54.713]  So they can sit there and put out anti-family, anti-gun, anti-freedom garbage.
[00:56:54.713 --> 00:56:59.577]  Now there's some good PBS facilities in the country run by good people.
[00:56:59.577 --> 00:57:01.738]  So I'm not even trying to bash public television.
[00:57:01.738 --> 00:57:03.699]  I've actually seen some good out of that.
[00:57:03.699 --> 00:57:12.486]  But the point is they still have government funding and then big mega-banker funding, foundation funding, and then viewers like you.
[00:57:13.629 --> 00:57:15.049]  So it's very elementary.
[00:57:15.049 --> 00:57:20.851]  If you believe in what we're doing and you believe it's good to give to a cause of waking people up, please donate.
[00:57:20.851 --> 00:57:26.813]  But listen, I do not want little old ladies who aren't doing well to give me one dime.
[00:57:26.813 --> 00:57:30.034]  I don't want young people who aren't doing well to give me anything.
[00:57:30.034 --> 00:57:31.134]  Spread the word about the show.
[00:57:31.134 --> 00:57:32.594]  Spread the word about the information.
[00:57:32.594 --> 00:57:33.795]  That's the most important thing.
[00:57:33.795 --> 00:57:37.636]  Spread the word about this transmission that's taking place right now for 27 hours straight.
[00:57:39.648 --> 00:57:48.858]  But for those of you that own businesses, those of you who don't like collectivism and tyranny and the banksters, who else is going to call for the arrest of the banksters?
[00:57:48.858 --> 00:57:51.201]  Who else is going to really point out what's happening?
[00:57:51.201 --> 00:57:53.263]  Who else is going to expose the system?
[00:57:53.263 --> 00:57:56.466]  Who else is going to expose the left-right paradigm and how they operate?
[00:57:56.466 --> 00:58:00.531]  Who else is going to give you results like you've seen here with the Infowars family?
[00:58:01.903 --> 00:58:13.092]  So I'm going to tell you right now, go to Infowarsmoneybomb.com if you want to make us stronger, if you want to see us grow even faster, if you want to see us expand what we're doing.
[00:58:13.092 --> 00:58:15.574]  We are doing the best job we can.
[00:58:15.574 --> 00:58:17.235]  We are busting our hind ends.
[00:58:17.235 --> 00:58:19.537]  I didn't leave here until 9.30 last night.
[00:58:21.453 --> 00:58:22.174]  And you know what?
[00:58:22.174 --> 00:58:24.496]  I'm not even seeing my family hardly now these days.
[00:58:24.496 --> 00:58:25.056]  But you know what?
[00:58:25.056 --> 00:58:29.320]  It's worth it because they have no future if we don't do this.
[00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:32.182]  So, spread the word about InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[00:58:32.182 --> 00:58:34.824]  Tell folks about the incredible 27-hour transmission.
[00:58:34.824 --> 00:58:38.928]  Spread that link out to everybody and donate now at InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.

[00:58:51.940 --> 00:59:07.390]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:59:07.390 --> 00:59:11.073]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:59:12.082 --> 00:59:24.854]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:59:24.854 --> 00:59:32.121]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:59:32.822 --> 00:59:43.189]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.

[00:59:56.337 --> 00:59:59.059]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.663 --> 01:00:10.485]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.485 --> 01:00:12.086]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.086 --> 01:00:13.626]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.626 --> 01:00:17.828]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.828 --> 01:00:21.890]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:38.905 --> 01:00:41.888]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[01:00:41.888 --> 01:00:43.309]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:00:43.309 --> 01:00:45.671]  Joel Skousen coming up in the next segment.
[01:00:45.671 --> 01:00:47.172]  We got Webster Griffin Carpley coming on.
[01:00:47.172 --> 01:00:50.975]  We're going to get into all this incredible police state geopolitical news.
[01:00:50.975 --> 01:00:52.817]  All of it is coming up now.
[01:00:54.383 --> 01:01:06.912]  Continuing here today, we're having the fourth annual money bomb, which is added treasure, as the founding fathers would say, to fund our info war against the globalists.
[01:01:06.912 --> 01:01:13.656]  You know, a couple of their Hellfire missiles cost a half million dollars that they're dropping on people.
[01:01:13.656 --> 01:01:21.702]  And the government takes your money, forces you to then give it to their systems, which are given to offshore banks.
[01:01:21.702 --> 01:01:22.743]  They don't give you a choice.
[01:01:24.039 --> 01:01:24.859]  We give you a choice.
[01:01:24.859 --> 01:01:33.464]  If you want to give your money in a place where it has more bang for its buck than anywhere else, then it's InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com or just go to InfoWars.com.
[01:01:33.464 --> 01:01:37.006]  There's a big giant banner on the top of the screen.
[01:01:37.006 --> 01:01:42.909]  You click on that and it takes you over there to the site where you can donate on PayPal, credit card, you name it.
[01:01:42.909 --> 01:01:43.249]  Also,
[01:01:44.830 --> 01:01:47.672]  I was going to do a bunch of pen and inks and even some acrylic.
[01:01:47.672 --> 01:01:49.273]  And I got so busy I never did it.
[01:01:49.273 --> 01:01:57.939]  But, during my two hour break tonight when Mike Adams is doing the show, I'm going to have him go over to Hobby Lobby or wherever and get me the art supplies.
[01:01:57.939 --> 01:02:00.441]  The problem is I know what I need.
[01:02:00.441 --> 01:02:01.642]  And maybe I'll just run over there.
[01:02:02.982 --> 01:02:11.708]  And do some, just because it's an idea, I've always wanted to do it, just some fast, quick paintings of different things, some political stuff, and then we're going to sell those on the eBay.
[01:02:11.708 --> 01:02:15.771]  There's a big link at InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com to our eBay selection.
[01:02:15.771 --> 01:02:16.932]  It's got Tyranny Crusher 2.
[01:02:16.932 --> 01:02:20.494]  We've actually used this for more than two years.
[01:02:20.494 --> 01:02:24.056]  It says on the eBay, we've been using it for two years.
[01:02:24.056 --> 01:02:25.698]  Actually, this was my spare.
[01:02:25.698 --> 01:02:26.978]  We've had this, I think, five years.
[01:02:27.979 --> 01:02:35.342]  And the other one got broken four years ago at the DNC when the MSNBC people attacked me with a knife, and it's all on video, and cut it.
[01:02:35.342 --> 01:02:36.462]  This is Tyranny Crusher 2.
[01:02:36.462 --> 01:02:41.504]  It's been used for five years, off and on, totally, in the last three and a half, four years.
[01:02:41.504 --> 01:02:44.205]  And it's signed by me, yours truly, Alex Jones.
[01:02:44.205 --> 01:02:46.246]  And it has the 2011 on it.
[01:02:46.246 --> 01:02:50.227]  And it says TC2, Tyranny Crusher 2 on it.
[01:02:50.227 --> 01:02:53.448]  And it's also got a pig on it that says, In The Fed.
[01:02:53.448 --> 01:02:55.189]  And this is up there for bid.
[01:02:56.832 --> 01:03:08.915]  Right now on the eBay site, we got a bunch of other, we printed out a bunch of Obama deception, fall of the republic color printouts to cover the wall with them to shoot promo videos for the films.
[01:03:08.915 --> 01:03:12.716]  And they've hung here in the office for three years and a year and a half respectively.
[01:03:12.716 --> 01:03:17.098]  We're now signing those, I'm signing those and pulling them down off the wall.
[01:03:17.098 --> 01:03:18.478]  So we're now pulling them down off the wall.
[01:03:18.478 --> 01:03:25.740]  We're going to be, I mean, whatever, whatever raises capital so that I can hire four or five more people and buy some more equipment.
[01:03:26.821 --> 01:03:41.054]  And because, again, with the Nightly News, I need to hire at least two or three more people to have a second string to be trained so that when people go on vacation, when things happen, so that we basically have that cushion.
[01:03:41.054 --> 01:03:42.095]  It's not even a cushion.
[01:03:42.095 --> 01:03:43.977]  You have to have it or you go crazy.
[01:03:43.977 --> 01:03:46.779]  That's why I'm grooming Aaron into the Nightly News show.
[01:03:46.779 --> 01:03:49.262]  Mike Adams also does a great job, comes in some and does it.
[01:03:50.102 --> 01:03:58.225]  I'm trying to get McBrain, who's a really smart, good guy, great reporter, to also do the nightly news sometimes, to where I'm doing it about four nights a week, somebody else is doing it one night a week.
[01:03:58.225 --> 01:04:00.246]  Because I also then have a plan to start other shows.
[01:04:00.246 --> 01:04:05.727]  I want to start a shooting show, maybe even five nights a week, about the Second Amendment.
[01:04:05.727 --> 01:04:07.308]  I got all these ideas I want to launch.
[01:04:08.647 --> 01:04:10.108]  And if we build it, they will come.
[01:04:10.108 --> 01:04:10.728]  You have come.
[01:04:10.728 --> 01:04:11.729]  We've done incredible things.
[01:04:11.729 --> 01:04:17.812]  But in the face of this new world order onslaught, I know that it is my responsibility to do even more.
[01:04:17.812 --> 01:04:18.692]  And that's what I'm doing.
[01:04:18.692 --> 01:04:19.933]  And you understand that.
[01:04:19.933 --> 01:04:20.773]  You resonate with that.
[01:04:20.773 --> 01:04:21.453]  You realize that.
[01:04:21.453 --> 01:04:26.396]  If you want to be part of this incredible historical thing we're doing together, donate today.

[01:04:53.233 --> 01:04:53.753]  Stay with us.
[01:04:53.753 --> 01:04:54.393]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:01.075 --> 01:05:02.676]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.

[01:06:30.219 --> 01:06:34.942]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.

[01:06:38.765 --> 01:06:40.006]  Others don't.

[01:07:04.801 --> 01:07:06.062]  Tyranny is here.
[01:07:06.062 --> 01:07:09.985]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:07:09.985 --> 01:07:12.227]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:07:12.227 --> 01:07:18.092]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:07:18.092 --> 01:07:24.337]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:07:24.757 --> 01:07:30.701]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:07:30.701 --> 01:07:34.904]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:07:34.904 --> 01:07:39.187]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:07:39.187 --> 01:07:45.132]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:07:45.132 --> 01:07:48.694]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:07:48.694 --> 01:07:50.675]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:07:50.675 --> 01:07:51.116]  It's here.

[01:08:32.908 --> 01:08:36.050]  You've seen the nightly news we've launched in the beta testing phase.
[01:08:36.050 --> 01:08:41.073]  Now we're going to start moving it into syndication to select cable and TV systems that want it.
[01:08:41.073 --> 01:08:43.835]  It won't be like a big national show on one big giant network.
[01:08:43.835 --> 01:08:48.338]  We'll have to deliver it here and there, but we've already got folks in different parts of the world and here in the U.S.
[01:08:48.338 --> 01:08:48.999]  ready to get it.
[01:08:48.999 --> 01:08:56.764]  Some TV stations are already grabbing the internet stream or downloading the higher quality file after it's over every night and airing it, like down in Houston, Texas.
[01:08:56.764 --> 01:08:59.466]  I need to create a whole list of where we're on as well.
[01:09:00.546 --> 01:09:08.869]  We have the syndicated radio show, we have the films we make, we have the news websites, InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:09:08.869 --> 01:09:12.911]  It has been my goal to start an internet TV network for a decade.
[01:09:12.911 --> 01:09:16.152]  And now you see it proliferating because the technology has gotten here.
[01:09:16.152 --> 01:09:22.755]  We've been streaming this radio show out as a type of television show with videos and documents and articles and guests.
[01:09:23.255 --> 01:09:37.798]  Now we're moving even deeper into that with reporters, investigative journalists, people flying all over the country, doing dozens of interviews a month via Skype, several a month in person, traveling around the country.
[01:09:37.798 --> 01:09:44.440]  We are moving into the next level, and it's the book sales, the video sales, the sponsors that make this show possible.
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:48.941]  But also, listeners four years ago had the idea for a money bomb.
[01:09:50.231 --> 01:09:55.427]  And I was like, no, I'm just going to stay here at my little 4,000 square foot office, make films, do the radio show.
[01:09:57.369 --> 01:10:02.411]  But they got all these people to pledge and all these donations came in, so I said, OK.
[01:10:02.411 --> 01:10:10.374]  And that pushed us to do what we've now done and gave me the idea to really try to grow in the face of the globalists to give it all I can.
[01:10:10.374 --> 01:10:11.034]  And we've done that.
[01:10:11.034 --> 01:10:13.995]  You know, most revolutionaries rob banks to fund themselves.
[01:10:13.995 --> 01:10:14.976]  Well, I'm not a revolutionary.
[01:10:14.976 --> 01:10:16.156]  I'm a restorationist.
[01:10:16.156 --> 01:10:22.979]  I want our republic, the rule of law, common law, the Constitution that our forebearers set up, I want that back.
[01:10:24.287 --> 01:10:30.950]  And, but I noticed when they were doing the money bomb four years ago, the COINTELPRO operatives screamed with anger.
[01:10:30.950 --> 01:10:42.214]  Because it's not just attacking Alex Jones, the idea of patriots, constitutionalists, libertarians, Christians, giving money to anti-New World Order groups.
[01:10:42.214 --> 01:10:47.276]  That idea frightens the New World Order because they got all the rich and powerful to pull their money to set up world government.
[01:10:47.921 --> 01:10:56.969]  They got your tax money on top of Rockefeller money and on top of begging locally to fund all this NPR to push anti-gun, anti-family trash.
[01:10:56.969 --> 01:10:58.410]  They've set up their own system.
[01:10:58.410 --> 01:11:04.435]  They have United Way and others raise billions of dollars on 9-11 and then keep half the money and spend most of it on gun control.
[01:11:05.973 --> 01:11:09.797]  See, that's why the system screams in anger.
[01:11:09.797 --> 01:11:13.661]  Just like 10 years ago, you couldn't buy organic food anywhere.
[01:11:13.661 --> 01:11:15.303]  You couldn't buy organic food anywhere.
[01:11:15.303 --> 01:11:18.807]  Now, because people wanted it in the market, it's displacing the garbage.
[01:11:18.807 --> 01:11:19.948]  People won't buy milk now.
[01:11:21.770 --> 01:11:24.492]  The bovine synthetic hormone in it.
[01:11:24.492 --> 01:11:25.973]  You see, it's happening.
[01:11:25.973 --> 01:11:27.575]  We're voting with our dollars.
[01:11:27.575 --> 01:11:37.162]  When you spread the word about InfoWars.com, when you go to InfoWars.com and get the video links, because we're streaming all this out for free right now, the next 27 hours, and send that out to others.
[01:11:37.162 --> 01:11:46.970]  We sent folks to Bilderberg, and just on Justin.TV, in three and a half days, we had 3.5 million views on one little channel we just set up.
[01:11:49.392 --> 01:11:56.554]  Not just the three million that tune into this show every day, three million extra just on one little internet system.
[01:11:56.554 --> 01:12:01.215]  Bill O'Reilly's the king of TV because he has two million viewers every night.
[01:12:01.215 --> 01:12:03.576]  They're paper tigers.
[01:12:03.576 --> 01:12:04.356]  That's my point.
[01:12:04.356 --> 01:12:08.017]  We've reached 300 million people in the last two and a half years on YouTube alone.
[01:12:08.017 --> 01:12:14.978]  By the way, we've now caught them with Ron Paul and myself, not letting our new videos be searchable, but Obama czar.
[01:12:14.978 --> 01:12:16.559]  Oh yeah, there's something going on at YouTube right now.
[01:12:16.559 --> 01:12:17.399]  You can check it for yourself.
[01:12:18.717 --> 01:12:23.058]  There's all sorts of things going on that are very sneaky because the system's scared.
[01:12:23.058 --> 01:12:25.299]  They're coming out saying they want to start censoring the web.
[01:12:25.299 --> 01:12:26.679]  In England, they're calling for it.
[01:12:26.679 --> 01:12:33.381]  They have this piracy bill that even members of Congress say will end the web as we know it, in due process.
[01:12:33.381 --> 01:12:38.862]  They're getting ready to launch a false flag on the web to try to start cracking down on it more.
[01:12:38.862 --> 01:12:39.802]  It's all coming down.
[01:12:39.802 --> 01:12:43.423]  We need to energize the alternative media now more than ever.
[01:12:44.700 --> 01:12:52.927]  Quite frankly, I could probably run around and add more ads to the show and do stuff and fund our growth, but people like a chance to give.
[01:12:52.927 --> 01:13:00.774]  And the fact that the system is so scared of this and comes out of the woodwork when we talk about a money bomb and a taxes, that shows I need to be doing this.
[01:13:00.774 --> 01:13:02.175]  Perhaps more.
[01:13:02.175 --> 01:13:05.458]  Also, support our local AM and FM affiliates.
[01:13:05.458 --> 01:13:07.800]  If you're a local business, sponsor the stations I'm on.
[01:13:08.857 --> 01:13:12.159]  If you're listening on a local station, call them.
[01:13:12.159 --> 01:13:13.060]  Thank them.
[01:13:13.060 --> 01:13:14.861]  Thank their sponsors.
[01:13:14.861 --> 01:13:24.567]  Put your money where your mouth is, like our founders did when they pledged their names, their honor, their treasure, their family, their sacred honor.
[01:13:24.567 --> 01:13:26.187]  All of it on the cause.
[01:13:26.187 --> 01:13:29.710]  All we're doing in the info war is saying, spread the word about us, support us.
[01:13:30.550 --> 01:13:33.052]  Donate at InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[01:13:33.052 --> 01:13:36.596]  Got a lot of items up at eBay, too, and the auction that also supported us.
[01:13:36.596 --> 01:13:38.377]  I'm gonna add some more stuff there today.
[01:13:38.377 --> 01:13:42.321]  It's all at InfoWars.com or InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com or PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:13:44.537 --> 01:13:50.461]  Coming up in the next 47 minutes or so, we're going to get into Israel considers preemptive attack on Iran.
[01:13:50.461 --> 01:13:53.202]  Is this more saber-rattling?
[01:13:53.202 --> 01:13:54.583]  They've hit Iraq before.
[01:13:54.583 --> 01:13:58.125]  They hit Syria three years ago, hit one of their nuclear facilities.
[01:13:58.125 --> 01:14:00.327]  In 1981, they hit Iraq.
[01:14:00.327 --> 01:14:02.788]  Netanyahu's asking for permission right now in the Cabinet.
[01:14:02.788 --> 01:14:04.329]  They're arguing about it.
[01:14:04.329 --> 01:14:05.910]  And I've got family in the military and others.
[01:14:05.910 --> 01:14:09.352]  They say they've been told it's going to happen, that Israel's going to attack and the U.S.
[01:14:09.352 --> 01:14:09.733]  will have to
[01:14:10.914 --> 01:14:14.177]  Mop it up or have, you know, anti-missile cruisers in the area.
[01:14:14.177 --> 01:14:15.398]  But that doesn't mean it's going to happen.
[01:14:15.398 --> 01:14:16.639]  If we get the word out, we can stop it.
[01:14:16.639 --> 01:14:18.680]  I want to get Joel Scalza's take on that.
[01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:21.502]  I want to get his take on the economy.
[01:14:21.502 --> 01:14:24.965]  I want to get his take on what's happening in the White House, fast and furious.
[01:14:24.965 --> 01:14:35.874]  This accelerated rollout of EAS alert, first-time takeover, November 9th, where the government's going to take over all the communications for the first time without stations voluntarily going over to it.
[01:14:37.245 --> 01:15:01.543]  I want to get into all of this with Joel Skousen, but coming up, Skousen, Tarpley, Albrecht, Norrie, Ike, Adams, Robert Scott Bell, so many others, Corbett, Tex Mars, we've got Jim Mars, Bob Chapman, Richard Reeves, Aaron Dykes, Fritz Springmeier, Paul Joseph Watson, and others.
[01:15:01.543 --> 01:15:03.885]  And we're going to premiere a Skull and Bones video.
[01:15:04.525 --> 01:15:06.165]  Here, with Charlottesville.
[01:15:06.165 --> 01:15:06.885]  Never before seen.
[01:15:06.885 --> 01:15:09.046]  We aired part one earlier in the year.
[01:15:09.046 --> 01:15:11.546]  It took us this long to get it together and edit the new part.
[01:15:11.546 --> 01:15:14.407]  And it's stuff never before seen or heard, some of this stuff.
[01:15:14.407 --> 01:15:14.727]  Okay?
[01:15:14.727 --> 01:15:18.468]  I know Aaron's been staying up for two days to finish it.
[01:15:18.468 --> 01:15:20.628]  Point is, that's all coming up today.
[01:15:20.628 --> 01:15:21.268]  All here.
[01:15:21.268 --> 01:15:23.849]  And the free video streams are at InfoWars.com.
[01:15:23.849 --> 01:15:24.389]  Get them.
[01:15:24.389 --> 01:15:25.469]  Get that out to everybody.
[01:15:25.469 --> 01:15:27.009]  That's how you can donate right there.
[01:15:27.009 --> 01:15:28.689]  It's just spreading the word.
[01:15:28.689 --> 01:15:29.990]  And I see the donations are pouring in.
[01:15:29.990 --> 01:15:31.230]  Let me give you the number, then we're going to Joel.
[01:15:32.637 --> 01:15:32.737]  888-253-3139.
[01:15:32.737 --> 01:15:34.558]  If you want to call in and donate, 888-253-3139.
[01:15:34.558 --> 01:15:34.639]  888-253-3139.
[01:15:34.639 --> 01:15:36.200]  We got eight people back there to take your calls.
[01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:38.922]  They're going to be there throughout the night, and I'm going to be up.
[01:15:38.922 --> 01:15:40.403]  I'm going to go to sleep at 2 until about 5.
[01:15:40.403 --> 01:15:42.725]  I'm going to get up, read more of the news at 5.
[01:15:53.137 --> 01:15:58.382]  Take a shower and stuff, and then I'll be back, you know, on the air, of course, until the show ends tomorrow at two o'clock.
[01:15:58.382 --> 01:15:59.463]  That's 27 hours.
[01:15:59.463 --> 01:16:04.048]  But live overnight for those four or five hours, we're going to have Watson and Aaron Dykes with some guests.
[01:16:04.048 --> 01:16:05.089]  You don't want to miss that.
[01:16:05.089 --> 01:16:05.489]  So again, 888-253-3139.
[01:16:05.489 --> 01:16:06.710]  It's the fourth annual InfoWars Money Bomb.
[01:16:11.134 --> 01:16:18.018]  The idea of the restorationists using the free market and your free will donating to build this.
[01:16:18.018 --> 01:16:23.241]  We're not like the government that takes your money and then bail out money and then gives it to MSNBC secretly.
[01:16:23.241 --> 01:16:24.442]  That's now come out.
[01:16:24.442 --> 01:16:25.363]  We don't do that.
[01:16:25.363 --> 01:16:27.404]  We're saying if you believe in this, donate to us.
[01:16:27.404 --> 01:16:32.507]  Now, going to the balance of the hour and a little bit of the next, we can do it because TARP is coming up at 8 after.
[01:16:33.729 --> 01:16:37.071]  We're joined by Joel Skousen, a political scientist by training.
[01:16:37.071 --> 01:16:40.973]  He, of course, was also a fighter pilot.
[01:16:40.973 --> 01:16:47.277]  We've gone over his bio many, many times here on air.
[01:16:47.277 --> 01:16:54.241]  And he is a world-renowned expert on strategic relocation, I guess bunker housing type systems.
[01:16:54.241 --> 01:16:56.203]  He publishes the World Affairs Brief.
[01:16:56.203 --> 01:16:58.184]  We also sell his books, one of our best sellers.
[01:16:59.004 --> 01:17:03.866]  Strategic relocation, the latest edition with all color photos about safest areas in the country.
[01:17:03.866 --> 01:17:05.286]  And I've done my own research.
[01:17:05.286 --> 01:17:06.747]  I agree with his analysis.
[01:17:06.747 --> 01:17:10.888]  So joelskousen.com, and of course you can get that all at infowars.com.
[01:17:10.888 --> 01:17:12.769]  We're going to go to break here in about three minutes.
[01:17:12.769 --> 01:17:14.770]  Joel, thank you for joining us during the Money Bomb.
[01:17:14.770 --> 01:17:21.612]  But out of all the things that are happening right now, just give us a brief summary overall of your take on what's happening.
[01:17:21.612 --> 01:17:24.313]  Then we'll come back, get into Iran, the economy, and more.
[01:17:25.776 --> 01:17:26.997]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[01:17:26.997 --> 01:17:33.321]  It's really a privilege to be on this very worthy cause, and thanks for the call.
[01:17:33.321 --> 01:17:35.723]  Things are really starting to move rapidly.
[01:17:35.723 --> 01:17:42.868]  One of the key elements that I saw was this decision to pull out of Iraq when they had no intention of pulling out.
[01:17:42.868 --> 01:17:52.295]  They were really stymied by the Iraqi opposition, but I think this Iran war is going to be there, and it's the only reason I could see why they're pushing up
[01:17:53.015 --> 01:18:07.307]  All of this propaganda, which lets the Iranians know this is coming very, very soon, and sacrificing military secrecy, which normally accompanies a preemptive strike, so it's a surprise.
[01:18:08.251 --> 01:18:20.216]  We'll talk a little bit more about the background I have on what I think the various parties are up to on this, but we are facing a major crisis right now in the economy because of the European debt situation.
[01:18:20.216 --> 01:18:26.579]  Greece has thrown a monkey wrench into the European debt resolution and bailout.
[01:18:26.579 --> 01:18:28.860]  The markets are responding extremely negatively.
[01:18:31.229 --> 01:18:40.831]  I think what's coming up that we really need to look at and talk about is what's coming up in November when the super committee brings out its report relative to
[01:18:42.423 --> 01:18:45.886]  The cuts that they're going to propose, I don't think Congress is going to be able to vote for those cuts.
[01:18:45.886 --> 01:19:02.262]  The automatic cuts will then trigger in, and I think this Occupy Wall Street movement, even though it's beneficial to our movement in the sense that it's attacking Wall Street, it is a leftist-based organization, and I think that they're going to trigger a great deal of
[01:19:03.709 --> 01:19:08.151]  Extreme violence and other further unrest when these automatic trigger cuts come in.
[01:19:08.151 --> 01:19:20.155]  So far, they really haven't got the wherewithal to do a major escalation of these demonstrations until that November report comes out.
[01:19:20.155 --> 01:19:21.296]  So that's coming up this month.
[01:19:25.438 --> 01:19:28.480]  Well, Joel, that's extremely interesting, and I concur with your breakdown.
[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:30.642]  Let's go through all of this on the other side.
[01:19:30.642 --> 01:19:34.765]  We've got Joel joining us via Skype from his home.
[01:19:34.765 --> 01:19:41.590]  We may go to telephone here in a moment, though, because his audio is really, really low for radio listeners out there.
[01:19:41.590 --> 01:19:43.872]  But this will be important information, obviously, straight ahead.
[01:19:44.312 --> 01:19:47.175]  My sources are Israel is planning to attack Iran.
[01:19:47.175 --> 01:19:49.177]  And I said that two and a half weeks ago.
[01:19:49.177 --> 01:19:51.038]  Now you see them openly saying they want to.
[01:19:51.038 --> 01:19:52.359]  So we're proving right again.
[01:19:52.359 --> 01:19:56.223]  And we'll get Joel's take on all of this on the other side.
[01:19:56.223 --> 01:19:57.885]  We could still stop it though.
[01:19:57.885 --> 01:20:01.228]  Or we'll get Joel's take on it if he thinks we can still stop it.
[01:20:01.228 --> 01:20:05.211]  Hey guys, are weaker testosterone levels taking you out of the game?
[01:20:05.211 --> 01:20:06.332]  Are you gaining fat?
[01:20:06.332 --> 01:20:07.073]  Feeling tired?
[01:20:07.273 --> 01:20:09.354]  Losing desire in the bedroom?
[01:20:09.354 --> 01:20:11.014]  Get back in the game!

[01:20:50.083 --> 01:20:50.143]  1-800-497-8345.
[01:21:01.369 --> 01:21:03.590]  Hey everybody, Jason Lewis here once again.
[01:21:03.590 --> 01:21:06.352]  These are hard times for investors.
[01:21:06.352 --> 01:21:12.175]  If you're like me, you just don't know where to put your money, because there's a downside to every possible scenario.
[01:21:12.175 --> 01:21:15.617]  Now look, every portfolio needs a hedge for inflation.
[01:21:15.617 --> 01:21:17.038]  Gold has been the classic.
[01:21:17.038 --> 01:21:20.119]  I want to tell you, I want to be honest with you, commodities fluctuate.
[01:21:20.119 --> 01:21:21.280]  So you could lose money.
[01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:22.721]  Gold goes up and down.
[01:21:22.721 --> 01:21:29.024]  But every stable portfolio usually has an inflation hedge, and gold is, well, the gold standard.
[01:21:29.224 --> 01:21:33.068]  Washington is not going to get us out of this recovery, so you've got to protect yourself.
[01:21:33.068 --> 01:21:41.077]  Give it some thought, and if you're interested in converting your IRA to gold, or would like to actually have it in your possession, call MIDAS Resources today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:44.841 --> 01:21:45.261]  The U.S.
[01:21:45.261 --> 01:21:49.926]  dollar was once backed by gold, but it's lost a lot of its value since then.
[01:21:49.926 --> 01:21:52.409]  Call MIDAS Resources today, 1-800-686-2237 for gold.
[01:21:52.409 --> 01:21:54.291]  That's 1-800-686-2237, and tell them Jason Lewis sent you.
[01:21:54.291 --> 01:21:55.032]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:22:02.299 --> 01:22:12.968]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[01:22:12.968 --> 01:22:20.174]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without your help.
[01:22:20.174 --> 01:22:30.943]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[01:22:31.423 --> 01:22:34.924]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[01:22:34.924 --> 01:22:41.066]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[01:22:41.066 --> 01:22:50.949]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[01:22:50.949 --> 01:22:52.450]  The war is here.
[01:22:52.450 --> 01:22:54.350]  It's an info war.
[01:22:54.350 --> 01:22:56.911]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[01:23:01.698 --> 01:23:05.079]  What nutrition are you missing that's leading to the four major diseases?
[01:23:05.079 --> 01:23:08.220]  Cancer, arthritis, heart disease, and Parkinson's.
[01:23:08.220 --> 01:23:23.105]  There are at least 80,000 medical studies that show a lack of the protein glutathione to be linked to cancer, heart disease, Parkinson's, macular degeneration, lung disease, digestive diseases, diabetes, Alzheimer's, ALS, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus.
[01:23:23.445 --> 01:23:23.966]  We're good to go!
[01:23:45.545 --> 01:23:46.085]  We're good to go.
[01:24:20.302 --> 01:24:28.626]  All right, Joel Skousen is our guest for five minutes into the next hour that Webster Tarpley joins us to give us his geopolitical perspective.
[01:24:28.626 --> 01:24:35.809]  Joel, so, wow, this is really news I don't like to hear because I respect your geopolitical analysis and view.
[01:24:35.809 --> 01:24:41.552]  Just to get it straight, you're concurring that they pretty much have green-lighted an attack on Iran.
[01:24:41.552 --> 01:24:42.112]  How long ago...
[01:24:43.593 --> 01:24:50.921]  Well, it's kind of an interesting story, and it's going to be the lead story on the World Affairs Brief coming out this Friday about this really difficult military decision.
[01:25:05.237 --> 01:25:10.763]  Story has been greenlighted, or at least the attack on Iran has been greenlighted, clear back to 2004.
[01:25:10.763 --> 01:25:23.736]  We know that because there was a major break in security in an insider meeting in the City of London that I reported on in the World Affairs Brief, whereby one of the persons who wasn't supposed to be there at the meeting was inadvertently invited.
[01:25:24.372 --> 01:25:34.935]  And they talked openly about the fact of how displeased the globalists were that Israel had not gone forward in their strike on Iran, and that was clear back in 2004.
[01:25:34.935 --> 01:25:37.696]  So this is something new.
[01:25:37.696 --> 01:25:44.478]  But what's interesting, in 2007, the establishment had to reverse its attack on Iran.
[01:25:44.478 --> 01:25:49.400]  They had three carrier task forces off of Iran ready to do it in the fall of 2007.
[01:25:51.282 --> 01:25:57.661]  Uh, you were covering that, I was covering that, and all of a sudden, they came out with the National Intelligent Estimate, the N-I-E.
[01:25:59.733 --> 01:26:06.798]  Which said suddenly that Iran had dropped their nuclear program, they were no longer a threat, and people said, what's going on here?
[01:26:06.798 --> 01:26:24.950]  And of course this was because, I believe, and that was my analysis, that Ron Paul, who was the only Republican running in 2008 on a very strong anti-war platform that was gaining popularity fast, the United States knew that they couldn't do a preemptive strike on Iran without engendering a great deal of anti-war
[01:26:26.814 --> 01:26:30.983]  Feeling in the United States that would accrue to the political benefit of Ron Paul.
[01:26:31.698 --> 01:26:41.461]  So suddenly, as soon as Ron Paul was defeated in the nomination process and really manipulated out of the show, suddenly the NIE reversed itself.
[01:26:41.461 --> 01:26:42.661]  So go figure.
[01:26:42.661 --> 01:26:48.143]  Obviously they were back on track, but Iran is now a threat and they've been pounding that drum ever since.
[01:26:48.143 --> 01:26:56.486]  But we've never seen a crescendo of propaganda and war beating of the drums as we've seen in the last two weeks.
[01:26:56.486 --> 01:27:00.587]  Every mainstream newspaper is touting all of the Israeli stories about the
[01:27:01.613 --> 01:27:05.014]  You're saying that's a show of deliberation to act like they thought things through?
[01:27:29.222 --> 01:27:34.446]  Absolutely true, and it's absolutely false, and so is the propaganda that Leon Panetta tried to stop this.
[01:27:34.446 --> 01:27:36.648]  It's going there to coordinate U.S.
[01:27:36.648 --> 01:27:37.588]  strategy.
[01:27:37.588 --> 01:27:38.629]  You go first.
[01:27:38.629 --> 01:27:43.793]  We'll come in and finish things up in a big way so that we can take the heat off of Israel.
[01:27:43.793 --> 01:27:46.315]  But they'll need to stage something after.
[01:27:46.315 --> 01:27:48.196]  Well, I know I've had families sent to Kuwait.
[01:27:48.196 --> 01:27:49.257]  I've talked to others.
[01:27:49.257 --> 01:27:53.641]  They're being told Israel will strike, and I don't want to give up too many sources.
[01:27:54.321 --> 01:28:00.386]  But they're at least telling mid-level military people that it's on and before the winter gets too deep.
[01:28:00.386 --> 01:28:05.350]  So that's why I said two and a half weeks ago, I said within two weeks, then that's the danger zone.
[01:28:05.350 --> 01:28:09.453]  And now, of course, it's all over the news that they're going ahead with this attack.
[01:28:09.453 --> 01:28:12.195]  Joel, is there any way from your view to stop it?
[01:28:14.736 --> 01:28:16.657]  No, I really don't believe so.
[01:28:16.657 --> 01:28:25.564]  The only thing that has stopped it up at this point is the failure to get, to induce Iran to do or to succumb to a Gulf of Tonkin episode.
[01:28:25.564 --> 01:28:28.506]  They tried to do it a couple of years ago when the U.S.
[01:28:28.506 --> 01:28:34.570]  Navy went into the Gulf of Hormuz and they had the Iranian speedboats harassing them and they came on U.S.
[01:28:34.570 --> 01:28:44.037]  black operations on the radio on their frequency speaking, you know, with Iranian people speaking as if the speedboats were going to attack the U.S.
[01:28:44.697 --> 01:28:45.298]  I don't know.
[01:29:05.652 --> 01:29:06.092]  The U.S.
[01:29:06.092 --> 01:29:08.354]  will beat the drums for the U.N.
[01:29:08.354 --> 01:29:09.335]  increased sanctions.
[01:29:09.335 --> 01:29:22.325]  They may try to get the cut off of gasoline, which ends up being a similar act of war to what produced the Pearl Harbor attack on Japan when Britain cut off their sources of fuel and gasoline to Japan.
[01:29:22.325 --> 01:29:23.326]  It's a very similar
[01:29:24.713 --> 01:29:25.554]  Joe, stay there.
[01:29:25.554 --> 01:29:26.715]  Long segment coming up.
[01:29:26.715 --> 01:29:28.776]  I concur with your analysis, unfortunately.
[01:29:28.776 --> 01:29:30.918]  I wish this wasn't what we're moving into.
[01:29:30.918 --> 01:29:44.887]  And so I want to look at, if the strike comes, which is probably a 95% chance now, barring a miracle, and we saw that with Fox Fallon refutives as well, as you said in 2007, 2008, barring a miracle, then what's going to happen?
[01:29:44.887 --> 01:29:46.688]  What do you think the aftermath will be of that?
[01:29:46.688 --> 01:29:48.289]  How does China tie in?
[01:29:48.289 --> 01:29:49.810]  How does Russia tie in?
[01:29:49.810 --> 01:29:50.170]  Stay with us.
[01:29:54.413 --> 01:30:02.200]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:02.200 --> 01:30:03.921]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:30:03.921 --> 01:30:09.225]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:30:09.225 --> 01:30:10.767]  Saving means to make money.

[01:30:27.818 --> 01:30:35.822]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.

[01:32:00.612 --> 01:32:05.154]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:32:05.154 --> 01:32:06.075]  Number one.
[01:32:06.075 --> 01:32:09.497]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:09.497 --> 01:32:10.357]  Number two.
[01:32:10.357 --> 01:32:15.240]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:15.240 --> 01:32:15.980]  It's true.
[01:32:15.980 --> 01:32:20.863]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:20.863 --> 01:32:21.683]  Number three.
[01:32:21.683 --> 01:32:25.265]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:25.265 --> 01:32:28.967]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:29.167 --> 01:32:29.968]  Number 4.
[01:32:29.968 --> 01:32:32.730]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:32.730 --> 01:32:36.414]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:32:36.414 --> 01:32:37.195]  Number 5.
[01:32:37.195 --> 01:32:41.358]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:32:41.358 --> 01:32:46.103]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:32:46.403 --> 01:32:50.568]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:50.568 --> 01:32:52.370]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:52.370 --> 01:32:54.612]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:32:54.612 --> 01:32:56.975]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:33:19.392 --> 01:33:21.493]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:33:21.493 --> 01:33:22.293]  to 2 p.m.
[01:33:22.293 --> 01:33:24.934]  we are here live back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:33:24.934 --> 01:33:39.759]  and of course weeknights that's not enough we're back weeknight 7 o'clock in full Wars nightly news why it's two hours long sometime you know soon I'm gonna add a few commercials in and get it up to different network specs and button it down
[01:33:40.379 --> 01:33:46.545]  But I'm actually enjoying this whole beta testing phase to figure out what I want to do with the show.
[01:33:46.545 --> 01:33:51.110]  I may even use the other set we've got built that hasn't been seen.
[01:33:51.110 --> 01:33:53.993]  I'm putting in another voiceover studio right now.
[01:33:53.993 --> 01:33:55.635]  I mean, I want to get more reporters.
[01:33:55.635 --> 01:33:57.296]  I want to get more hosts.
[01:33:57.296 --> 01:34:00.339]  I mean, I've got TV systems I can get on right now.
[01:34:00.339 --> 01:34:02.942]  The big dirty secret, though, is you get on
[01:34:03.943 --> 01:34:05.184]  A British satellite system?
[01:34:05.184 --> 01:34:10.048]  I've got one offering an hour show right now, years ago, offering in.
[01:34:10.048 --> 01:34:11.129]  You get on U.S.
[01:34:11.129 --> 01:34:22.898]  systems or Channel 2000-something on one of the DISH systems, you might have 50,000, 100,000 viewers, maybe, if the show's been on for six, seven months and people get used to it.
[01:34:22.898 --> 01:34:32.125]  Again, we have millions and millions a day, and it's growing through the Internet and good old-fashioned AM and FM, but also XM, Channel 166.
[01:34:33.991 --> 01:34:34.792]  Which is a lot of people.
[01:34:55.509 --> 01:34:58.790]  But overall, it's about the investigative journalist teams.
[01:34:58.790 --> 01:35:03.951]  It's about the constant news and constant reports and condensing it down to 30 minutes or an hour a night.
[01:35:03.951 --> 01:35:05.032]  I haven't really decided yet.
[01:35:05.032 --> 01:35:10.893]  I'm leaning towards 30 minutes just so it's quick and easy, but has all the information people need.
[01:35:10.893 --> 01:35:16.215]  More of a discipline type format, which is hard for me to do, obviously, because I just, I love knowledge and love information.
[01:35:17.015 --> 01:35:19.016]  But we're doing all of this because of you.
[01:35:19.016 --> 01:35:24.737]  So if you haven't donated yet at InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com, please do today.
[01:35:24.737 --> 01:35:28.118]  Again, NPR gets government money and then begs for money.
[01:35:28.118 --> 01:35:36.981]  And nobody says that's wrong, but when people that are patriots do it, there's this system-wide stigma because they're scared of good people giving.
[01:35:37.381 --> 01:35:38.002]  We're good to go.
[01:35:54.162 --> 01:35:55.543]  This is an important platform.
[01:35:55.543 --> 01:35:56.583]  It's not perfect.
[01:35:56.583 --> 01:36:00.586]  In fact, I don't have a high view of myself at the end of the day.
[01:36:00.586 --> 01:36:05.328]  I mean, I know we're all fallen creatures, but the message is what is important.
[01:36:05.328 --> 01:36:07.610]  Be part of this fourth annual Money Bomb.
[01:36:07.610 --> 01:36:12.232]  Help us get the new crew we need, the expanded crew, three or four more people.
[01:36:12.232 --> 01:36:18.736]  Help us, five people if we can afford it, and help us get the extra equipment we need to actually syndicate the show now.
[01:36:19.096 --> 01:36:23.579]  And by the way, the free streams are at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:36:23.579 --> 01:36:31.646]  Right now, you can go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.tv or InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com, and there's the mainstream from our system that's high quality.
[01:36:31.646 --> 01:36:37.950]  We've got the backup systems on Justin.tv, Ustream, and other systems that are moderate quality.
[01:36:37.950 --> 01:36:40.412]  It's all there right now.
[01:36:40.412 --> 01:36:43.154]  Get that link out to everyone you know.
[01:36:43.154 --> 01:36:44.836]  Since we started the show an hour and a half ago,
[01:36:45.396 --> 01:36:46.377]  We've raised an additional $20,000.
[01:36:46.377 --> 01:36:49.721]  It's up to $74,000 right now.
[01:36:49.721 --> 01:36:51.624]  We need to go all the way to the top.
[01:36:51.624 --> 01:36:59.934]  $500,000 to hire the four or five people to buy that equipment and to not have to eat into our emergency reserve.
[01:36:59.934 --> 01:37:02.056]  Frankly, to expand everything like I've done,
[01:37:03.781 --> 01:37:09.086]  I've had to eat into our reserves where this company barely has any reserves now, which I don't like to do.
[01:37:09.086 --> 01:37:11.748]  But everything's coming down right now and it's just going to get crazier.
[01:37:11.748 --> 01:37:13.390]  So the banks can't be trusted.
[01:37:13.390 --> 01:37:17.113]  So instead of having four or five months of backup, we've got like two months of backup.
[01:37:19.595 --> 01:37:27.481]  I wasn't going to do a money bomb until I was being attacked a few months ago, and I realized, you know, the system is attacking me for doing this because they're scared of it.
[01:37:27.481 --> 01:37:33.585]  We should do this, but I'm going to shut up now and try to give Joel Scouse on the floor, joining us from his home via video Skype.
[01:37:33.585 --> 01:37:35.867]  Joel Scouse, and again, fighter pilot.
[01:37:36.827 --> 01:37:58.405]  Decorated what I think a Marine Corps fighter pilot I haven't scanned over his whole bio today and worked in so many areas is of course uncle Cleon Skousen wrote really some of the original handbooks that did accurately map what the globalists were up to this whole crony anti free market system but Joel you were getting to the critical juncture here
[01:37:59.285 --> 01:38:01.326]  That you believe they are?
[01:38:01.326 --> 01:38:04.048]  I mean, obviously they're flaunting it publicly.
[01:38:04.048 --> 01:38:07.890]  So this isn't just some political saber-rattling to make Iran back off?
[01:38:07.890 --> 01:38:08.791]  I mean, is that what you're saying?
[01:38:08.791 --> 01:38:11.873]  They're about to fuel the reactors in the next two weeks?
[01:38:11.873 --> 01:38:17.816]  When would you expect, and from your sources, what are you hearing is going to happen in the strike?
[01:38:17.816 --> 01:38:19.017]  My family, others.
[01:38:20.237 --> 01:38:46.474]  And of course public sources as well have said the US is planning that once Iran is hit to quote back it up as you said finish it off out of Kuwait Give us your details on that and then from bad to worse the ramifications of this what what you think is going to unwind and why the global elite are doing this is it more about a diversion for the new Bank of the World Vatican calling for Bank of the World
[01:38:47.615 --> 01:38:59.383]  And calling for a global currency, I mean as you said the quickening is happening But you've said you believe it really gets crazy in the next 10 years out So if this is just a birth pain my god, what's coming next?
[01:38:59.383 --> 01:39:01.105]  So kind of cover that spectrum.
[01:39:01.105 --> 01:39:03.787]  You've got the floor Thanks Alex.
[01:39:03.787 --> 01:39:13.054]  Let me get some background here This is the there are two major agendas in this global advice that is squeezing the world one is going to be military military is able to conjure up a
[01:39:13.664 --> 01:39:20.186]  The worst propaganda in terms of false patriotism and get even conservatives to go along with what the government wants.
[01:39:20.186 --> 01:39:22.407]  And squeezing people financially does another thing.
[01:39:22.407 --> 01:39:25.888]  Those are the two primary thrusts of the new world order.
[01:39:25.888 --> 01:39:37.933]  Military squeezing of people to give them power to resolve military conflicts, and then squeezing them financially with a massive catastrophe that they themselves created and giving them the power then to so-called resolve it.
[01:39:37.933 --> 01:39:41.134]  I'll cover the economy later, but let's go to the war pincer movement.
[01:39:42.908 --> 01:40:02.435]  It's been well documented on your show and your researchers as well as mine that strategically, this war on Iran is the reason why the United States government, black operations and everything, had focused on attacking Iraq and attacking Afghanistan even before the false flag 9-11 operation.
[01:40:02.435 --> 01:40:04.936]  Those were the two nations they wanted to go into.
[01:40:04.936 --> 01:40:05.457]  Why?
[01:40:05.457 --> 01:40:08.718]  One of the reasons is not only to capture Iraqi oil,
[01:40:09.658 --> 01:40:15.502]  And to continue to aggravate the Muslim world by entering Pakistan and Afghanistan.
[01:40:15.502 --> 01:40:18.164]  But ultimately there's going to be a pincer movement on Iran.
[01:40:18.164 --> 01:40:24.228]  Iran is a huge part of... Iran is a huge power structure, both military and intellectual.
[01:40:25.231 --> 01:40:25.451]  In that
[01:40:44.766 --> 01:40:55.348]  At the beginning of the next year, and I think that is why they pushed up this schedule on Iran, because they've always intended to build these huge five major bases.
[01:40:55.348 --> 01:41:03.450]  There's 14 total bases in Iraq, but the five major bases were built and oversized specifically for what's coming up on attack on Iran.
[01:41:03.450 --> 01:41:05.550]  And that's why I think they've had to raise the schedule.
[01:41:05.550 --> 01:41:09.731]  And as I said, that's the reason why they sacrificed military secrecy
[01:41:10.431 --> 01:41:19.219]  In order to justify this in the public eye, there's a tremendous anti-war sentiment in the United States because of the budgetary problems.
[01:41:19.219 --> 01:41:21.881]  Ron Paul's message is resonating with people.
[01:41:21.881 --> 01:41:24.624]  We cannot afford another trillion dollar war.
[01:41:24.624 --> 01:41:28.807]  So they've got to have a major excuse to pull this off.
[01:41:28.807 --> 01:41:37.735]  And as I said, I think they're going to work through the UN, they're going to work through increased sanctions, gasoline cutoff of Iran to try to get Iran to react militarily.
[01:41:38.706 --> 01:41:40.066]  I don't think this is going to happen.
[01:41:40.066 --> 01:41:49.609]  I think Iran has decided they're going to wait for a preemptive strike so that they've got the appearance of non-aggression on their side when they retaliate.
[01:41:49.609 --> 01:41:51.030]  Here's how I think this is going to play out.
[01:41:51.030 --> 01:41:53.971]  Let me just first of all cover Russia and China's view on this.
[01:41:53.971 --> 01:42:02.173]  Because a lot of people are focusing on the fact that Russia and China are both still sending over a great deal of military technology to Iran.
[01:42:02.173 --> 01:42:08.055]  And they've decried this report that they've already seen that comes out next week claiming Iran's secretly developing nukes.
[01:42:09.750 --> 01:42:26.164]  So, but as happened in Iraq, and it's very important, even though Russia was military supporting Iraq, during the first Gulf War they were sending in transport airplanes with military reinforcements during the entire, and they weren't touched by American pilots.
[01:42:26.924 --> 01:42:31.706]  They're still going to play that game as if we're going to support you, Iran, but I don't think they will.
[01:42:31.706 --> 01:42:36.008]  I think they're going to pull out and let Iran fall to this attack.
[01:42:36.008 --> 01:42:46.332]  So I don't think we're going to be able to... They're going to support them in the UN, they're going to veto any sanctions, but they're not going to support Iran when it comes to what's going on.
[01:42:46.332 --> 01:42:52.635]  Well, I tend to agree, because there's actually been, for those that don't know, historically, a lot of enmity between the Russians and the Iranians.
[01:42:53.865 --> 01:42:58.153]  Well that's because the Iranians don't want to be controlled by either the Chinese or the Russians.
[01:42:58.153 --> 01:43:00.338]  And the Russians don't like that, the Chinese don't like that.
[01:43:00.338 --> 01:43:05.989]  But nevertheless, there's a longer term agenda here that's very important and I made this point on previous shows.
[01:43:06.932 --> 01:43:14.456]  This is not going to lead to the World War III scenario that I'm predicting, the nuclear war that Russia and China are preparing for long-term.
[01:43:14.456 --> 01:43:16.597]  They're at least 10 years out on that.
[01:43:16.597 --> 01:43:20.439]  But they must prepare the world for the image that the U.S.
[01:43:20.439 --> 01:43:22.060]  is the bully of the world.
[01:43:22.060 --> 01:43:30.425]  Every time they allow the United States to come in and wipe out a nation like Iraq, take over and oppress it, and Afghanistan, they gain points in the world.
[01:43:30.425 --> 01:43:32.766]  They create hatred against the United States.
[01:43:32.766 --> 01:43:36.228]  We ourselves are creating that hatred by our intervention.
[01:43:37.017 --> 01:43:42.740]  This is building the excuse for this great war that they're planning.
[01:43:42.740 --> 01:43:47.662]  And I think that explains why North Korea is being pampered while Iran is being attacked.
[01:43:47.662 --> 01:43:53.965]  North Korea is being carefully kept in position as a nuclear power, as a trigger for World War III.
[01:43:53.965 --> 01:43:56.647]  And as I say, I think that's a long-term op.
[01:43:56.647 --> 01:44:02.249]  But the important point is to realize that Russia and China have a real purpose in allowing the U.S.
[01:44:02.249 --> 01:44:03.770]  to come in and devastate Iran.
[01:44:03.770 --> 01:44:05.211]  And here's how I think it's going to play out.
[01:44:06.124 --> 01:44:17.469]  I think Israel is going to do a preemptive nuclear strike, not nuclear strike, but preemptive conventional strike on nuclear facilities just enough to trigger Iranian retaliation.
[01:44:17.469 --> 01:44:25.473]  Now they sent out a warning to Iran and the rest of the world by testing a long-range Jericho missile which is capable of carrying nuclear weapons.
[01:44:25.473 --> 01:44:33.336]  I think they're telegraphing a message to Iran, don't even think about throwing any big weapons at us or we'll retaliate with missiles.
[01:44:34.150 --> 01:44:47.574]  But we have to remember that it is my analysis that this exchange between Iran and Israel will lead, first of all, to an American intervention, and that intervention will be massive.
[01:44:47.574 --> 01:44:52.075]  I think the caretaker facilities in the Iraqi bases will immediately be downloaded
[01:44:52.682 --> 01:45:06.028]  From US troops in the United States that will start to launch a massive interdiction in Iran if they retaliate at all or in the least either to Israel or to US bases in Iraq.
[01:45:06.028 --> 01:45:10.470]  But the US retaliation will be more than just the nuclear facilities.
[01:45:10.470 --> 01:45:13.091]  Just as they went into Libya on false pretenses.
[01:45:13.746 --> 01:45:14.827]  Humanitarian Action.
[01:45:34.657 --> 01:45:35.818]  I don't know.
[01:45:51.038 --> 01:45:52.478]  What was it just four years ago?
[01:45:52.478 --> 01:45:57.939]  They purposefully leaked in even Time Magazine the two different U.S.
[01:45:57.939 --> 01:46:00.540]  plans of what they're going to hit in Iraq.
[01:46:00.540 --> 01:46:02.140]  And one of them was hundreds of sites.
[01:46:02.140 --> 01:46:03.620]  The other was thousands.
[01:46:03.620 --> 01:46:13.722]  Their entire infrastructure, their bridges, their airports, their power, anything, quote, that could aid the military, their entire infrastructure, bombing it to the Stone Age.
[01:46:13.722 --> 01:46:17.183]  I mean, what a humanitarian crime that will be.
[01:46:17.643 --> 01:46:22.465]  Why, Joel, would they put out the different attack plans?
[01:46:22.465 --> 01:46:24.786]  And what's the point of putting the attack plan out today?
[01:46:29.011 --> 01:46:31.373]  They're not really putting out the detailed attack plan.
[01:46:31.373 --> 01:46:37.379]  I personally think, for example, that Israel has a problem in that it wants to avoid going over Syria.
[01:46:37.379 --> 01:46:42.064]  Syria has serious Russian anti-aircraft missile batteries.
[01:46:42.064 --> 01:46:47.269]  And so that's why Israel has gotten permission from Saudi Arabia to overfly their nation.
[01:46:47.269 --> 01:46:52.755]  They're going to take the southern route over to Iran, overflying Saudi Arabia, and trying to thread the needle
[01:46:53.315 --> 01:47:02.358]  Down between Jordan and Egypt so that they don't get into trouble or try to trigger any wars by these strikes that are going out there.
[01:47:02.358 --> 01:47:08.380]  But I think what's going to happen, they're going to have that preemptive strike using the bunker-busting bombs that the U.S.
[01:47:08.380 --> 01:47:11.161]  has recently transferred to Israel on the nuclear facilities.
[01:47:11.161 --> 01:47:13.422]  There'll be a retaliation against U.S.
[01:47:13.422 --> 01:47:14.402]  and Israeli targets.
[01:47:14.882 --> 01:47:17.463]  And then I think all hell's going to break loose in the Middle East.
[01:47:17.463 --> 01:47:24.707]  I think that's going to be the turn of events that Syria, Lebanon, and Egypt will all universally join forces and launch.
[01:47:24.707 --> 01:47:29.709]  But Israel, the worst nightmare they could face is the barrage missile attack.
[01:47:29.709 --> 01:47:33.791]  You know, there's over 3,000 missiles aimed at Israel and these other three countries around them.
[01:47:33.791 --> 01:47:41.275]  And if they launch them in barrages, the aero-anti-ballistic missile system that Israel has will simply be overwhelmed.
[01:47:41.275 --> 01:47:43.156]  It might be lucky to take out a dozen.
[01:47:44.005 --> 01:47:44.325]  I don't know.
[01:48:06.511 --> 01:48:08.533]  To bring Iran to its knees.
[01:48:08.533 --> 01:48:11.156]  They do not want to have to occupy Iran.
[01:48:11.156 --> 01:48:11.997]  Don't have the troops.
[01:48:11.997 --> 01:48:14.480]  There's no tolerance for occupying Iran.
[01:48:14.480 --> 01:48:25.531]  So they must bring it completely to the knees so that the Iranian government simply gives up and lets the New World Order impose its will upon Iran without occupation.
[01:48:25.531 --> 01:48:27.113]  And that's the difference between now and Iran.
[01:48:27.836 --> 01:48:38.001]  Now, we know the Iranians, 20-something years ago, when they had tinker toy weapons compared to what they have now, put up an incredible seven-year fight against Saddam in the full U.S.
[01:48:38.001 --> 01:48:40.302]  backing, and over a million of them died.
[01:48:40.302 --> 01:48:53.428]  I mean, looking at the different profiles of the Iranians, and there's 80 million of them instead of 25 million Iraqis, I mean, this is probably going to get super nasty.
[01:48:54.622 --> 01:48:55.163]  The U.S.
[01:48:55.163 --> 01:49:03.311]  attack plans plan to fight this war at a suitable distance specifically because of this vastly increased Iranian arsenal.
[01:49:03.311 --> 01:49:13.961]  You are not going to see any of our ships go into the Straits of Hormuz until we have devastated first all of the naval assets of Iran which have potent sea skimming missiles which could be devastating.
[01:49:14.862 --> 01:49:23.209]  And Iran does have long range missiles, or I'm sorry, medium range missiles that can reach Israel and can reach naval forces.
[01:49:23.209 --> 01:49:23.929]  So the U.S.
[01:49:23.929 --> 01:49:28.012]  is going to do a stand back long distance attack.
[01:49:28.012 --> 01:49:32.936]  Certainly, but what about the proxy forces, Hezbollah, other sleeper cells?
[01:49:32.936 --> 01:49:42.564]  I mean, that's the Iranian tactic, is going to be not just missiles, but they're going to undoubtedly turn loose asymmetrical squads in Israel and other areas.
[01:49:42.564 --> 01:49:44.145]  I mean, all hell is going to break loose.
[01:49:44.645 --> 01:49:45.206]  Absolutely.
[01:49:45.206 --> 01:49:48.729]  We're going to see a total Hezbollah attack into Israel.
[01:49:48.729 --> 01:49:51.111]  We're going to see it crossing the border.
[01:49:51.111 --> 01:49:54.114]  Israel's going to have its hand full, especially with missiles raining down.
[01:49:54.114 --> 01:49:56.936]  I think Syria's going to unleash all of their missiles.
[01:49:56.936 --> 01:49:58.057]  And they have ground forces.
[01:49:58.057 --> 01:49:59.519]  They have tanks.
[01:49:59.519 --> 01:50:03.342]  This is going to be a massive Middle East war, in my opinion.
[01:50:03.342 --> 01:50:06.084]  It's not going to end soon, and it's not going to end easily.
[01:50:06.084 --> 01:50:10.849]  It's not going to be like a cakewalk that relatively Iraq was for U.S.
[01:50:10.849 --> 01:50:11.109]  forces.
[01:50:11.394 --> 01:50:14.997]  Yeah, I've talked to military people I know who are usually, oh, it's no problem.
[01:50:14.997 --> 01:50:17.219]  For years they've said, we don't want to attack Iran.
[01:50:17.219 --> 01:50:22.303]  And now they're really concerned because they realize this is going to be a big, nasty war.
[01:50:22.303 --> 01:50:24.605]  And the Iranians aren't going to give up.
[01:50:24.605 --> 01:50:32.492]  And I think the people that think that they're going to bomb them, and then they're going to have an uprising of, you know, the young people who want to listen to rock and roll, that's not going to happen.
[01:50:32.492 --> 01:50:36.315]  When their own country's bombed, most of those peaceniks are going to end up joining the mullahs.
[01:50:37.316 --> 01:50:37.776]  Absolutely.
[01:50:37.776 --> 01:50:41.717]  There's going to be a tremendous patriotic rebellion against the West, against Israel in Iran.
[01:50:41.717 --> 01:50:45.599]  All right, well, let's come back, Joel, in the next two short segments with you.
[01:50:45.599 --> 01:50:46.799]  Wow, I could talk to you all day.
[01:50:46.799 --> 01:50:48.680]  We really appreciate you joining us.
[01:50:48.680 --> 01:50:51.981]  And get your view on why they're doing this now.
[01:50:51.981 --> 01:50:57.823]  Obviously, for the political distractions, for this new Bank of the World being set up that the Vatican and others are talking about.
[01:50:57.823 --> 01:51:00.023]  Joel Skousens, our guest, World Affairs Briefs, his website.
[01:51:00.023 --> 01:51:01.384]  We'll tell you the website when we come back.
[01:51:01.384 --> 01:51:04.925]  If you're a man over 40, you may feel like half the man you used to be.
[01:51:05.245 --> 01:51:06.806]  Are you gaining more body fat?
[01:51:06.806 --> 01:51:08.167]  Are you feeling tired?
[01:51:08.167 --> 01:51:10.129]  Are you losing your sex drive?
[01:51:10.129 --> 01:51:11.249]  It's not your fault.
[01:51:11.249 --> 01:51:14.312]  After 40, your body's testosterone may start dropping.
[01:51:14.312 --> 01:51:20.336]  And if you are an African-American man, you're at a higher risk of your testosterone turning into estrogen.
[01:51:20.336 --> 01:51:21.877]  Be the man you used to be.
[01:51:21.877 --> 01:51:25.580]  Call for a risk-free trial of Ageless Male, a natural supplement.
[01:51:25.740 --> 01:51:31.462]  Shown to raise testosterone by 61% and maintain healthy, normal levels.
[01:51:31.462 --> 01:51:35.544]  You can feel the youthful energy and the healthy sex drive you once had.
[01:51:35.544 --> 01:51:37.605]  And ageless male is all natural.
[01:51:37.605 --> 01:51:39.446]  No injections or appointments.
[01:51:39.446 --> 01:51:40.926]  Just one quick phone call.
[01:51:40.926 --> 01:51:43.347]  Get your risk-free trial of ageless male.
[01:51:43.347 --> 01:51:43.607]  Call 1-800-497-8345.
[01:51:43.607 --> 01:51:43.848]  That's 1-800-497-8345.
[01:51:49.790 --> 01:51:54.835]  With Ageless Mail, you can raise your testosterone naturally by 61%!
[01:51:54.835 --> 01:51:57.897]  Call 1-800-497-8345.
[01:51:57.897 --> 01:52:02.541]  That's 1-800-497-8345.
[01:52:02.541 --> 01:52:07.246]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[01:52:07.246 --> 01:52:13.071]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[01:52:13.763 --> 01:52:15.924]  Number one, study the past.
[01:52:15.924 --> 01:52:18.325]  History really does repeat itself.
[01:52:18.325 --> 01:52:23.187]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[01:52:23.187 --> 01:52:26.268]  Number three, take decisive action.
[01:52:26.268 --> 01:52:30.109]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[01:52:30.109 --> 01:52:35.172]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[01:52:35.172 --> 01:52:38.573]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[01:52:39.153 --> 01:52:42.555]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[01:52:42.555 --> 01:52:47.058]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:52:47.058 --> 01:52:52.001]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[01:52:52.001 --> 01:52:56.603]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:52:56.603 --> 01:53:02.187]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:53:02.187 --> 01:53:05.849]  That's the sound of your door being kicked in by an intruder with a single kick.
[01:53:07.225 --> 01:53:12.526]  That's the sound of the same door now protected by the Door Sentinel at MySafeDoor.com.
[01:53:12.526 --> 01:53:16.287]  Go to MySafeDoor.com right now and watch the amazing video.
[01:53:16.287 --> 01:53:21.728]  At MySafeDoor.com, you'll learn how to turn your home into a fortress with the Door Sentinel.
[01:53:21.728 --> 01:53:26.549]  16 kicks later, and the Door Sentinel is still holding strong.
[01:53:26.549 --> 01:53:27.949]  MySafeDoor.com.
[01:53:27.949 --> 01:53:30.169]  That's MySafeDoor.com.
[01:53:30.169 --> 01:53:32.310]  We want to know, how do you use Webex?
[01:53:33.513 --> 01:53:36.475]  I use Webex anytime I need to meet with clients.
[01:53:36.475 --> 01:53:41.098]  With the new Webex High Quality Video, it's like meeting face-to-face.
[01:53:41.098 --> 01:53:44.800]  Connect online and share what's on your computer screen with others.
[01:53:44.800 --> 01:53:46.381]  Anytime, anywhere.
[01:53:46.381 --> 01:53:49.623]  On their desktop, on their laptop, or mobile device.
[01:53:49.623 --> 01:53:51.564]  How do you use Webex?
[01:53:51.564 --> 01:53:55.927]  Go to Webex.com right now and try Webex free.
[01:53:55.927 --> 01:53:58.048]  Webex from Cisco.
[01:53:58.048 --> 01:53:59.789]  Webex.com
[01:54:13.601 --> 01:54:20.766]  We are fueling our tanks right now to launch another attack on the New World Order and the Info War.
[01:54:20.766 --> 01:54:23.047]  And the pen is mightier than the sword.
[01:54:23.047 --> 01:54:29.552]  That's why when the globalists weren't ready for this to be public three weeks ago, they attacked me big time when I said they were green-lighting the attack on Iran.
[01:54:29.552 --> 01:54:32.874]  Because they don't want you to have a debate about that.
[01:54:32.874 --> 01:54:35.256]  They just want to sell you the propaganda.
[01:54:35.256 --> 01:54:41.400]  But it did basically blow up in their face that fake Iranian thing with the used car salesman that came out and turned out to be fake.
[01:54:42.369 --> 01:54:43.290]  They don't care.
[01:54:43.290 --> 01:54:46.551]  They're moving along with this new report that they're developing nukes.
[01:54:46.551 --> 01:54:53.055]  If you want to learn about Strategic Relocation, North American Guide to Safe Places, 3rd Edition, we sold out of this for a while, but we've got it back in.
[01:54:53.055 --> 01:54:55.176]  It's available at InfoWars.com.
[01:54:55.176 --> 01:54:57.558]  Jill Skousen's excellent book.
[01:54:57.558 --> 01:55:03.741]  And Purchase of Books videos, not just, you know, only supports our operation, but the authors themselves.
[01:55:03.741 --> 01:55:04.622]  We've also got a deal.
[01:55:05.981 --> 01:55:10.244]  Because of all this stuff coming down where I'm selling our bumper sticker packs at cost.
[01:55:10.244 --> 01:55:13.386]  This is at cost.
[01:55:13.386 --> 01:55:18.149]  It was $25 to get the 25 pack of bumper stickers.
[01:55:18.149 --> 01:55:18.469]  Now it's $5.95.
[01:55:18.469 --> 01:55:20.030]  That's at cost.
[01:55:24.711 --> 01:55:27.212]  We've got the patriotic Don't Trout On Me flags.
[01:55:27.212 --> 01:55:30.794]  We've got the Alex Jones Essential Special.
[01:55:30.794 --> 01:55:32.876]  Five of my best films are $24.95.
[01:55:32.876 --> 01:55:37.078]  We have the Alex Everything Special.
[01:55:37.078 --> 01:55:37.998]  How many films is that?
[01:55:37.998 --> 01:55:39.919]  It's like 12, 13, 14 films.
[01:55:39.919 --> 01:55:41.300]  You can go look it up.
[01:55:41.300 --> 01:55:42.161]  Normally $349.
[01:55:42.161 --> 01:55:44.362]  It's $99.95 right now.
[01:55:44.362 --> 01:55:46.263]  The Alex Jones Everything Special.
[01:55:46.263 --> 01:55:47.604]  All of my films.
[01:55:47.604 --> 01:55:49.965]  So that's available as well.
[01:55:49.965 --> 01:55:51.966]  And don't forget InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[01:55:51.966 --> 01:55:53.027]  We only do this once a year.
[01:55:53.727 --> 01:56:00.151]  We fight back against NPR and the rest of them by saying, hey, why not donate to help build our larger media operation?
[01:56:00.151 --> 01:56:04.773]  We're not just doing a radio show here, but the films, the news websites, all of it.
[01:56:04.773 --> 01:56:10.656]  Going back to Joel Skousen, Joel, I was getting into the point of why are they doing this?
[01:56:10.656 --> 01:56:13.178]  We've talked about it looks like they're going to do it.
[01:56:13.178 --> 01:56:14.619]  This is what will happen militarily.
[01:56:15.660 --> 01:56:19.566]  But why is the establishment doing it right now?
[01:56:19.566 --> 01:56:29.921]  I mean, clearly it's because they're openly bringing the world into global receivership, announcing the Bank of the World, the global currency, or at least the beginnings of it, or are there other factors?
[01:56:30.869 --> 01:56:36.394]  Personally, Alex, I do not believe that the global currency is anywhere near in the offing.
[01:56:36.394 --> 01:56:38.916]  They keep talking about it's going to take years of talk.
[01:56:38.916 --> 01:56:45.902]  You just don't have enough money creation power in the world to replace what the dollar has spewed forth around the world.
[01:56:45.902 --> 01:56:48.565]  We've spread our inflation.
[01:56:48.565 --> 01:56:50.766]  It's a hundred times larger than any other currency.
[01:56:50.766 --> 01:56:52.228]  Sure, why launch the war now then?
[01:56:53.653 --> 01:57:02.324]  I believe the war is being launched now specifically because their major kingpin in this pincer attack on Iran is losing the bases in Iraq.
[01:57:02.324 --> 01:57:06.409]  They want to move this before they actually have to go through with the Iraq withdrawal.
[01:57:08.772 --> 01:57:15.075]  Predicting this for years that the US would do anything to keep from having to abandon those bases there.
[01:57:15.075 --> 01:57:16.996]  And I think this is why it's happening.
[01:57:16.996 --> 01:57:18.957]  It's a short-term approach.
[01:57:18.957 --> 01:57:24.760]  They've been trying to get this Iran attack off the road in a long time and that's why they're beefing up the propaganda.
[01:57:25.828 --> 01:57:31.730]  But that attack, I think, is going to go forward regardless, even if they have to do it completely, preemptively.
[01:57:31.730 --> 01:57:39.233]  And that's why Netanyahu, Prime Minister of Israel, keeps beating the drums about Iran as our biggest threat, and that threat is growing.
[01:57:39.233 --> 01:57:45.596]  And by the way, that'll help him politically, and also the neocons have told Obama, do this and we'll stop attacking you.
[01:57:47.130 --> 01:57:47.991]  That's right.
[01:57:47.991 --> 01:57:49.273]  And of course, it's not going to happen.
[01:57:49.273 --> 01:57:56.684]  But remember the large, the big picture here is that war is the only thing that's really going to give us a new world currency.
[01:57:56.684 --> 01:57:57.926]  There is no mechanism.
[01:57:58.610 --> 01:58:01.571]  To voluntarily place with a basket currency or anything else.
[01:58:01.571 --> 01:58:03.071]  I've explained that in my World Affairs Brief.
[01:58:03.071 --> 01:58:09.292]  You can't have an EU type of agreement between the basket of currencies to inflate at a uniform rate.
[01:58:09.292 --> 01:58:10.852]  The dollar people will not agree to it.
[01:58:10.852 --> 01:58:12.593]  The Chinese will not agree to it.
[01:58:12.593 --> 01:58:19.374]  There isn't any currency that anyone will agree to a fixed rate of inflation because everybody needs to be secretly inflating.
[01:58:19.374 --> 01:58:23.695]  That's the only game in town and they can stretch this out, believe it or not, for another
[01:58:24.847 --> 01:58:26.168]  Eight to ten years, I believe.
[01:58:26.168 --> 01:58:27.028]  All right, Joel, stay there.
[01:58:27.028 --> 01:58:28.709]  We're gonna come back with five more minutes with you.
[01:58:28.709 --> 01:58:29.870]  Wish we had more time.
[01:58:29.870 --> 01:58:32.251]  And Webster Tarpley's coming up, and we'll take some calls then.
[01:58:32.251 --> 01:58:36.053]  Worldaffairsbrief.com is Joel's website.
[01:58:36.053 --> 01:58:38.815]  We're gonna be broadcasting for 27 hours straight.
[01:58:38.815 --> 01:58:41.816]  Stay with us.
[01:58:41.816 --> 01:58:45.318]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.318 --> 01:58:46.699]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.403 --> 01:58:59.505]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:58:59.505 --> 01:59:02.046]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:59:02.046 --> 01:59:07.427]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:59:07.427 --> 01:59:10.467]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:59:10.467 --> 01:59:12.528]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:59:12.788 --> 01:59:19.032]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:59:19.032 --> 01:59:22.414]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:59:22.414 --> 01:59:28.197]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:59:28.197 --> 01:59:29.838]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:59:29.838 --> 01:59:31.139]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:59:31.139 --> 01:59:33.821]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:59:33.821 --> 01:59:38.043]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:59:38.043 --> 01:59:40.065]  You can find the video at www.
[01:59:40.825 --> 01:59:42.646]  End of America 3.com.
[01:59:42.646 --> 01:59:45.227]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[01:59:54.252 --> 01:59:56.634]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.634 --> 01:59:59.375]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:06.038 --> 02:00:10.885]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.885 --> 02:00:12.467]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.467 --> 02:00:14.009]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.009 --> 02:00:18.216]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.216 --> 02:00:22.281]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:27.603 --> 02:00:34.228]  I agree with Joel Skousen that we're not going to see the new cashless world currency next month or next year.
[02:00:34.228 --> 02:00:36.250]  The point is they're moving into these STRs.
[02:00:36.250 --> 02:00:38.412]  They're getting the governments under one authority.
[02:00:38.412 --> 02:00:44.777]  The European Union is collapsing more of the sovereignty of the nations into its own system.
[02:00:44.777 --> 02:00:46.878]  And they admit it's undemocratic, but the Greeks...
[02:00:47.879 --> 02:00:49.981]  Boy, it's confusing what's going on over there.
[02:00:49.981 --> 02:00:53.224]  First they're going to have a referendum, then they aren't, then they are, then they aren't, now they are.
[02:00:53.224 --> 02:00:56.007]  They're talking about getting, firing their military.
[02:00:56.007 --> 02:01:00.511]  Joel, just briefly, from your research, what's going on in Greece right now?
[02:01:00.511 --> 02:01:07.858]  Well, Prime Minister Papandreou is the son of the former communist, great Prime Minister Papandreou.
[02:01:07.858 --> 02:01:09.760]  But he still has to play to the left.
[02:01:09.760 --> 02:01:10.681]  But he is a globalist.
[02:01:12.873 --> 02:01:22.820]  He was in a pincer, a political pincer, because of the globalists wanting no referendum and his own coalition saying, look, we've got to take the heat off of us or we're going to lose this election.
[02:01:22.820 --> 02:01:27.803]  And so they wanted the referendum, in essence, to put the blame on the people.
[02:01:27.803 --> 02:01:30.645]  So that when they rejected the Greek, it would be the people.
[02:01:30.645 --> 02:01:39.811]  But the breaking news was just this last hour while we were talking, Papandreou finally exceeded the globalist demand and called off the referendum.
[02:01:39.811 --> 02:01:40.932]  And that looks permanent now.
[02:01:43.081 --> 02:01:43.621]  Unbelievable.
[02:01:43.621 --> 02:01:48.903]  What do you think about this new, quote, economic union where the countries are, quote, never allowed to leave?
[02:01:48.903 --> 02:01:51.404]  I mean, that's, that's financial dictatorship.
[02:01:51.404 --> 02:02:09.191]  Yeah, that's the new Soviet version of the European Union, of which, you know, the Socialist International, which is the Moscow front, has been, and is very much a part of the European Union, has been pushing for this Sovietized version, whereby, you know, we can't let people run off and just leave their obligations to leave us standing.
[02:02:09.191 --> 02:02:10.312]  And this will happen, of course,
[02:02:10.812 --> 02:02:18.238]  If they get an EU wide bonding system whereby all the nations are on the hook for these bonds and that's what they're trying to do.
[02:02:18.238 --> 02:02:20.300]  Once again they use the deep of the crisis.
[02:02:21.132 --> 02:02:25.735]  People like Zero Hedge keep saying the European Union is about to fall apart.
[02:02:25.735 --> 02:02:29.298]  The Eurosceptics in Britain are having a heyday right now watching this crisis.
[02:02:29.298 --> 02:02:31.139]  No, they're only using this to get more power.
[02:02:31.139 --> 02:02:33.120]  They always like the banker bailout here.
[02:02:33.120 --> 02:02:33.981]  It's all staged.
[02:02:33.981 --> 02:02:34.941]  They admit it is.
[02:02:34.941 --> 02:02:35.782]  Exactly.
[02:02:35.782 --> 02:02:37.203]  And that's exactly what's happening.
[02:02:37.203 --> 02:02:40.685]  The EU G20 meeting going on right now.
[02:02:40.685 --> 02:02:42.246]  There's a lot of arms being twisted.
[02:02:42.246 --> 02:02:49.932]  They're looking at Greece and that's... I think there were some behind the scenes stuff going on at the G20 meeting that turned
[02:02:51.232 --> 02:02:55.193]  Papandreou around, but we're going to see Greece stay in there.
[02:02:55.193 --> 02:02:57.834]  We're going to see, and they've got to do this to save Italy.
[02:02:57.834 --> 02:03:04.255]  Italy is very nearing the basket case that Greece is in, and it's five times larger than Greece.
[02:03:04.255 --> 02:03:06.096]  This is a major problem.
[02:03:06.096 --> 02:03:08.737]  So they don't want a domino effect going on.
[02:03:08.737 --> 02:03:18.339]  And right now I think they're moving towards condensing a lot more Euroskeptics to join and giving the EU much greater power to control finances.
[02:03:19.710 --> 02:03:22.491]  Joel, we've got Webster Tarbly coming up who's been in Libya.
[02:03:22.491 --> 02:03:24.412]  We're going to get his take on what happened in Libya.
[02:03:24.412 --> 02:03:27.774]  We're going to get his take on the economy and more.
[02:03:27.774 --> 02:03:37.178]  We're doing a 27-hour transmission here, but if you can, when we go to break, I want to hold you just two or three minutes on the other side and get your view on Election 2012, the different candidates.
[02:03:39.611 --> 02:03:40.612]  We've got about a minute and a half now.
[02:03:40.612 --> 02:03:41.813]  Go ahead and start.
[02:03:41.813 --> 02:03:48.199]  Well, it's been amazing to see the manipulation of the Republican nomination process.
[02:03:48.199 --> 02:03:56.026]  It's even worse than 2008 when Rudolph Giuliani, a cross-dressing, non-conservative person, was trying to foist it on the people.
[02:03:56.026 --> 02:04:01.050]  He wasn't hacking the polls, even though they were claiming he had 30% support.
[02:04:01.050 --> 02:04:05.474]  They pulled him out of the first two primaries so that they wouldn't document his low rating.
[02:04:06.343 --> 02:04:10.306]  And resurrected John McCain with six newspaper endorsements.
[02:04:10.306 --> 02:04:12.728]  Now the problem is that Romney got a head start in 2008.
[02:04:12.728 --> 02:04:18.033]  They brought out Huckabee to kill Romney's chances with the Fundamentalist Christians.
[02:04:18.863 --> 02:04:30.336]  They, Huckabee wasn't in for it this time, and so they brought in Herman Cain to do that, to pull off the Christian vote and to bring up the, you know, the Mormon versus Evangelical arguments all over again.
[02:04:30.336 --> 02:04:35.743]  They tried to resurrect Rick Perry, who's a globalist masquerading as a conservative.
[02:04:35.743 --> 02:04:37.244]  And all of these things are failing.
[02:04:37.865 --> 02:04:45.529]  So what they're faced now, especially with Herman Cain going into a nose dive over his Anita Hill problems, you know, like Clarence Thomas.
[02:04:45.529 --> 02:04:47.891]  And so now they're having to control Romney.
[02:04:47.891 --> 02:04:51.433]  Looks like they're going to be able to do that, and I can cover that after the break.
[02:04:51.433 --> 02:04:55.355]  Yeah, let's break down your view on that, and then we'll get Webster Tarpley up right after that.
[02:04:55.355 --> 02:04:55.955]  Stay with us.
[02:04:55.955 --> 02:04:56.976]  We'll be right back.

[02:06:02.515 --> 02:06:06.516]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:06:06.516 --> 02:06:09.777]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:06:09.777 --> 02:06:14.558]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:06:14.558 --> 02:06:20.959]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:06:20.959 --> 02:06:23.200]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:06:23.720 --> 02:06:24.760]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:06:24.760 --> 02:06:25.480]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:06:25.480 --> 02:06:27.361]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:06:42.645 --> 02:06:47.028]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[02:06:47.028 --> 02:06:49.930]  we have seen a fall of the republic.
[02:06:49.930 --> 02:06:59.117]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:07:02.392 --> 02:07:07.096]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[02:07:07.096 --> 02:07:13.523]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[02:07:13.523 --> 02:07:15.805]  Number one, study the past.
[02:07:15.805 --> 02:07:18.207]  History really does repeat itself.
[02:07:18.207 --> 02:07:21.930]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[02:07:23.041 --> 02:07:26.143]  Number three, take decisive action.
[02:07:26.143 --> 02:07:29.985]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[02:07:29.985 --> 02:07:35.028]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[02:07:35.028 --> 02:07:39.030]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[02:07:39.030 --> 02:07:42.452]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[02:07:42.452 --> 02:07:46.074]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:07:46.934 --> 02:07:51.856]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[02:07:51.856 --> 02:07:56.479]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:07:56.479 --> 02:07:59.160]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:08:06.260 --> 02:08:11.103]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:08:11.103 --> 02:08:12.684]  You want answers?
[02:08:12.684 --> 02:08:14.224]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:14.224 --> 02:08:18.427]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:18.427 --> 02:08:24.410]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:24.410 --> 02:08:27.172]  Well, I always enjoy talking to Joel Skelton.
[02:08:27.172 --> 02:08:29.373]  Webster Tarpley's coming up here in about five minutes.
[02:08:33.405 --> 02:08:34.346]  So much is happening.
[02:08:34.346 --> 02:08:37.429]  I mean, this is an incredible time we're living through.
[02:08:37.429 --> 02:08:43.695]  World governments being unveiled publicly, the Vatican's calling for the Bank of the World, global currency.
[02:08:43.695 --> 02:08:49.640]  The point is, all those people that called us kooks and things, you know, who's laughing now?
[02:08:49.640 --> 02:08:56.446]  And just like I told you two and a half weeks ago, I said, the word is I've got within two weeks, and then out from that point, there could be an attack.
[02:08:56.446 --> 02:08:57.808]  Briefly, before we get back into politics,
[02:08:59.229 --> 02:09:04.272]  Because I know you spoke to this, but specifically with any of your sources, I know you have a lot of them, Joel.
[02:09:04.272 --> 02:09:14.818]  I've been told anytime from three or four days ago up until the middle of December, that's the window to strike because the US troops have to leave in December.
[02:09:14.818 --> 02:09:17.379]  That's what I've been told by the military sources, multiple.
[02:09:17.379 --> 02:09:19.140]  Just what you said.
[02:09:19.140 --> 02:09:27.145]  They're also looking at Kuwait as a command base to launch US attacks aircraft, including helicopters flying around over the ocean, shooting up their patrol boats.
[02:09:29.166 --> 02:09:33.947]  And what's the time frame on an Israeli then backed up by a U.S.
[02:09:33.947 --> 02:09:35.688]  strike on Iran?
[02:09:35.688 --> 02:09:45.271]  Well, my military sources indicate that indeed they are transferring assets right now to Kuwait, and there also is a steady stream of shipments going into Israel.
[02:09:45.271 --> 02:09:49.553]  That means they're beefing up their supplies of military hardware for this attack.
[02:09:49.553 --> 02:09:55.755]  I can't say, and I don't know if any of my military sources know, when the date's coming, because I think it's still in flux.
[02:09:56.368 --> 02:10:03.123]  They're still trying to wait for a political justification or a public propaganda justification.
[02:10:03.123 --> 02:10:05.808]  Short of that, though, it's going to happen before January.
[02:10:06.892 --> 02:10:07.372]  Yeah.
[02:10:07.372 --> 02:10:09.034]  Why do you think, when the U.S.
[02:10:09.034 --> 02:10:15.881]  is forced to leave Iraq, why do you think they're doing an emergency EAS takeover drill for the first time in history?
[02:10:15.881 --> 02:10:17.822]  They're not working radio.
[02:10:17.822 --> 02:10:22.167]  This is the first time where the government takes over the radio and TV.
[02:10:22.167 --> 02:10:24.229]  That system's been in place since 96.
[02:10:24.229 --> 02:10:26.551]  The overall system since the 50s.
[02:10:26.551 --> 02:10:28.032]  Part of, you know, obviously,
[02:10:30.094 --> 02:10:37.420]  Nuclear attack civil defense system, but but now they're even talking about cell phones in the future will be taken over by the government.
[02:10:37.420 --> 02:10:49.209]  Telescreens everywhere, but November 9th, they're doing a FEMA FCC martial law takeover drill, and I've learned they're also going to have nationwide TSA checkpoints on the same day.
[02:10:49.209 --> 02:10:53.112]  This is clearly an internal defense martial law drill, Joel.
[02:10:53.769 --> 02:10:58.051]  Well, I would be careful not to make too much of this one coming November 9th.
[02:10:58.051 --> 02:11:00.952]  They're not going to do that much that quick.
[02:11:00.952 --> 02:11:07.555]  I think what they're doing, the major change is they're intervening in daytime, in the afternoon, which is going to impact television.
[02:11:07.555 --> 02:11:13.117]  They're going to get up front and noticed by people, but they won't take it to any extremes.
[02:11:13.117 --> 02:11:18.980]  I think this is an incremental step up of just what you're talking about, but it's not going to happen this time.
[02:11:18.980 --> 02:11:20.240]  It's going to get in your face.
[02:11:20.240 --> 02:11:22.041]  People are getting used to the inconvenience.
[02:11:22.461 --> 02:11:25.588]  But it's further down the line when this other stuff gets really big.
[02:11:25.588 --> 02:11:26.349]  But you're right.
[02:11:26.349 --> 02:11:28.113]  This is the track that they're heading on.
[02:11:28.113 --> 02:11:30.097]  But let's not make too much out of the ninth one.
[02:11:30.097 --> 02:11:32.101]  I think we'll disappoint people like Y2K.
[02:11:33.482 --> 02:11:34.983]  No, no, I agree with you.
[02:11:34.983 --> 02:11:40.947]  They're beta testing it, just like they're now going to have PSAs on hotel TV saying look for terrorists.
[02:11:40.947 --> 02:11:41.207]  Right.
[02:11:41.207 --> 02:11:44.609]  It's just all part of this Stasi society.
[02:11:44.609 --> 02:11:51.354]  I mean, if Americans, Joel, could see this, get in a time machine from 50 years ago and come to this time, what would they think?
[02:11:51.354 --> 02:11:54.676]  I mean, this is classic authoritarianism being set up.
[02:11:54.676 --> 02:11:57.998]  They'd be in rebellion if they saw it now, but gradually they get to accept it.
[02:11:57.998 --> 02:12:03.182]  That's the only reason that it can explain why the TSA continues to needle people at the airport.
[02:12:03.762 --> 02:12:08.066]  Which violates the basic principle of don't bother people unless they rebel against you.
[02:12:08.066 --> 02:12:11.989]  But they're determined to get people used to this kind of needling.
[02:12:11.989 --> 02:12:13.791]  Used to this kind of interference.
[02:12:13.791 --> 02:12:15.932]  And that's why we're going to get more of it on television.
[02:12:15.932 --> 02:12:17.714]  But it's going to be incremental.
[02:12:17.714 --> 02:12:21.437]  And if they get too much resistance, they'll back off a little bit.
[02:12:21.437 --> 02:12:24.860]  Just like TSA always pretends to back off.
[02:12:24.860 --> 02:12:28.323]  Like they did when they said they won't shake down children anymore.
[02:12:28.323 --> 02:12:29.484]  And then they went back to it again.
[02:12:30.438 --> 02:12:32.379]  That's right, it's all military tactics.
[02:12:32.379 --> 02:12:34.699]  And people say, well, at least America's America.
[02:12:34.699 --> 02:12:36.840]  We're run by global banks, folks.
[02:12:36.840 --> 02:12:40.921]  So, again, people either say Russia's good or we're bad, or we're good, Russia's bad.
[02:12:40.921 --> 02:12:41.461]  No.
[02:12:41.461 --> 02:12:43.722]  It's all crook-run, as Joel's pointed out.
[02:12:43.722 --> 02:12:52.244]  It's just different factions of crooks, but they all use the same systems, all use the latest developments in manipulation.
[02:12:52.244 --> 02:12:53.025]  Now, in two minutes,
[02:12:54.285 --> 02:13:02.114]  Joe, you were breaking down your view of how they are playing the candidates off against each other to suppress Ron Paul.
[02:13:02.114 --> 02:13:03.796]  Finish up your point about Mitt Romney.
[02:13:03.796 --> 02:13:13.847]  Well, the point is that Mitt Romney has tried for years, anybody but Mitt Romney, but he's continued to stay there despite bringing up, you know, John Huntsman, Chris Christie,
[02:13:14.788 --> 02:13:17.872]  Uh, Herman Cain, he's outlasted them all.
[02:13:17.872 --> 02:13:21.195]  And what that does, it puts Ron Paul in second place.
[02:13:21.195 --> 02:13:22.537]  They don't want him in second place.
[02:13:22.537 --> 02:13:25.540]  They don't want to have a convention battle with Ron Paul.
[02:13:25.540 --> 02:13:34.430]  They still have enough time to bring out another candidate, may try to resurrect Huntsman again, but ultimately they are preparing big time to control him.
[02:13:34.430 --> 02:13:35.772]  Romney is not a globalist.
[02:13:36.372 --> 02:13:45.992]  He's trying, bending over backwards to be one, but because he hasn't bought into the system in terms of compromise and moral indiscretions with his wife, thinks they can use the twist arms.
[02:13:46.917 --> 02:13:56.445]  They are afraid that he's going to see something in the White House, that he's smart, he may well see it, and they may have to control him like they did Ronald Reagan with an assassination attempt.
[02:13:56.445 --> 02:14:03.852]  So they've surrounded him with globalist advisors, with neocons, Michael Chertoff of all people, he's the dark baiter of the TSA crowd.
[02:14:03.852 --> 02:14:10.818]  I mean, how could a man be that stupid to take on Michael Chertoff as a major advisor?
[02:14:10.818 --> 02:14:13.540]  Well, look at Herman Cain, the former head of the Federal Reserve.
[02:14:15.034 --> 02:14:22.639]  In Kansas City, you've got Herman Cain trying to introduce new taxing systems on top of the income tax.
[02:14:22.639 --> 02:14:29.103]  And then you've got, like you said, Mitt Romney, all these advisors where carbon taxes, Al Gore praising him.
[02:14:29.103 --> 02:14:32.945]  And then you've got Rick Perry, all the same stuff coming out of him.
[02:14:32.945 --> 02:14:38.348]  And now we learn it's reportedly Rahm Emanuel leaking the stuff on Cain.
[02:14:38.348 --> 02:14:39.769]  It's just an amazing free-for-all.
[02:14:40.289 --> 02:14:44.154]  Joel Skousen of worldaffairsbrief.com, the editor-in-chief over there.
[02:14:44.154 --> 02:14:45.556]  Thank you so much for spending time with us.
[02:14:45.939 --> 02:14:46.859]  My pleasure, Alex.
[02:14:46.859 --> 02:14:49.000]  And good luck on your show today.
[02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:49.781]  Thank you so much.
[02:14:49.781 --> 02:14:53.562]  Yes, if you just joined us, we're doing a 27-hour transmission.
[02:14:53.562 --> 02:14:56.603]  We're two hours and 15 minutes into this one.
[02:14:56.603 --> 02:14:58.424]  And there's free audio and video streams.
[02:14:58.424 --> 02:14:59.904]  There's always free audio streams.
[02:14:59.904 --> 02:15:03.906]  But free video streams at InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com or just go to InfoWars.com.
[02:15:03.906 --> 02:15:04.986]  You can't miss them.
[02:15:04.986 --> 02:15:06.127]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:15:06.127 --> 02:15:07.827]  We've got them everywhere.
[02:15:07.827 --> 02:15:11.329]  We've been streaming the nightly news since it was live last night through to this morning.
[02:15:12.189 --> 02:15:19.112]  When we do a Nightly News tonight or tomorrow, because we're going to be basically live at those times, but just so much going on here.
[02:15:19.112 --> 02:15:32.218]  If you just joined us, I would encourage everybody to go up to InfoWars.com and to InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com and go into the press release section area.
[02:15:33.433 --> 02:15:36.216]  And you can see the schedule.
[02:15:36.216 --> 02:15:51.711]  Of course we had Dave Mustaine and Jesse Ventura on two powerful interviews yesterday, but today Joel Skousen, Webster Tarpley, Catherine Albrecht, George Norrie, David Icke, Mike Adams, Robert Scott Bell, Tex Mars, Mr. Corbett, the Corbett Report,
[02:15:53.532 --> 02:16:05.696]  Mr. Jim Mars, Fritz Springmeier, Aaron Dykes, Watson, Paul Watson, Richard Reeves, Alan Watt, Jim Mars, Bob Chapman.
[02:16:05.696 --> 02:16:11.758]  And yes, we're either going to premiere an incredible interview up in Anchorage, Alaska, we did.
[02:16:11.758 --> 02:16:13.419]  It's never before been seen with
[02:16:15.731 --> 02:16:21.854]  The individual who's, of course, exposed so much of the HAARP system and more, and that's Dr. Nick Baggage.
[02:16:21.854 --> 02:16:25.516]  Or we're going to premiere, and I think it's going to be the skull and bones side.
[02:16:25.516 --> 02:16:28.857]  You know, you saw part one, Charlotte Isabel on education.
[02:16:28.857 --> 02:16:30.058]  Her dad was skull and bones.
[02:16:31.565 --> 02:16:40.428]  And other family as well, but the point is Skull and Bones and she was high-level government and she showed us stuff never before seen on Skull and Bones.
[02:16:40.428 --> 02:16:45.490]  And we're looking to premiere that coming up as well.
[02:16:45.490 --> 02:16:51.812]  That is set to happen tomorrow morning.
[02:16:51.812 --> 02:16:53.412]  What time is that set to happen?
[02:16:53.412 --> 02:16:53.733]  7 a.m.
[02:16:55.680 --> 02:16:58.062]  Who knows, though, I might air it in the middle of the night when Aaron's on as well.
[02:16:58.062 --> 02:16:59.663]  It's just so powerful.
[02:16:59.663 --> 02:17:01.444]  And then, of course, it'll be archived at the end.
[02:17:01.444 --> 02:17:05.506]  I've noticed we've been putting the special reports in the nightly news section.
[02:17:05.506 --> 02:17:07.588]  So that's got all the reports and special reports.
[02:17:07.588 --> 02:17:11.150]  We're going to start moving those over to the special reports section, which hasn't been updated in a month.
[02:17:11.150 --> 02:17:12.471]  That's just an oversight.
[02:17:12.471 --> 02:17:18.194]  And I'm going to be putting some things in the rant section as well, over at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:17:18.194 --> 02:17:20.576]  Now, this is the fourth annual InfoWars Money Bomb.
[02:17:21.721 --> 02:17:26.863]  You give money to United Way, they give a bunch of it to gun control groups.
[02:17:26.863 --> 02:17:32.404]  If you give money to NPR, they use it to sell anti-gun, anti-family garbage to the public.
[02:17:32.404 --> 02:17:42.027]  We have sponsors, we have video sales, stuff like that, but to do capital improvements, to hire more people, and guarantee their jobs, and to buy the very expensive equipment.
[02:17:42.027 --> 02:17:45.969]  I mean, I gotta buy equipment that costs what houses cost.
[02:17:45.969 --> 02:17:49.310]  Bandwidth costs every month.
[02:17:49.310 --> 02:17:49.850]  I could live in a
[02:17:51.629 --> 02:17:53.630]  60 bedroom mansion.
[02:17:53.630 --> 02:17:56.351]  We spend a lot of money around here.
[02:17:56.351 --> 02:17:57.352]  On the bandwidth, on everything.
[02:17:57.352 --> 02:17:58.192]  We have a lot of cost.
[02:17:58.192 --> 02:17:59.653]  And we're giving the globals a run for their money.
[02:17:59.653 --> 02:18:04.055]  And you can see the fruits of it, how fast we're growing, the people we've reached.
[02:18:04.055 --> 02:18:09.818]  But as the country goes into depression, our audience goes straight up, but our funding basically planes out.
[02:18:10.578 --> 02:18:14.862]  And so it is the Money Bombs that help push us over the edge to be able to grow.
[02:18:14.862 --> 02:18:17.944]  Infowarsmoneybomb.com, Infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[02:18:17.944 --> 02:18:26.351]  A lot of the hours also we're going to have open hours for phones and people view on the world and other news and your calls on the Money Bomb.
[02:18:26.351 --> 02:18:36.960]  We've got also at Infowarsmoneybomb.com down at the bottom a link to our eBay store with a lot of, you know, Tyranny Crusher 2, Bullhorn, a sledgehammer I use to break up on the wall to the next side of the office.
[02:18:38.001 --> 02:18:40.504]  And it was used to actually tear open the hole to the other side.
[02:18:40.504 --> 02:18:43.206]  People are like, you're bashing out a wall that's an internal wall.
[02:18:43.206 --> 02:18:47.551]  Well, yeah, we started tearing that out first because I didn't want to mess up the electrical equipment in the wall.
[02:18:47.551 --> 02:18:49.833]  But point is, we got a video of that.
[02:18:49.833 --> 02:18:51.915]  We did build a studio over there is the point.
[02:18:51.915 --> 02:18:53.897]  And so there's that sledgehammer.
[02:18:53.897 --> 02:18:54.438]  It's available.
[02:18:54.858 --> 02:18:59.680]  I'm going to do some pen and inks that are one time only and some acrylic paintings.
[02:18:59.680 --> 02:19:05.382]  It'll be more impressionistic probably because I can do those and kind of turn my brain off and even do better paintings when I just relax.
[02:19:05.382 --> 02:19:07.423]  If I do technical things, it takes me time.
[02:19:07.423 --> 02:19:08.123]  I won't have time.
[02:19:08.123 --> 02:19:09.184]  But tonight I'm going to do some of those.
[02:19:09.184 --> 02:19:10.644]  I'm going to videotape that.
[02:19:10.644 --> 02:19:15.086]  Then we'll put those up for auction as well tomorrow for the Money Bomb.
[02:19:15.086 --> 02:19:16.787]  The Money Bomb will go right through into the weekend.
[02:19:16.787 --> 02:19:19.448]  We need to raise that half million dollars right now.
[02:19:19.448 --> 02:19:21.789]  We're going to break and come back for the balance of the hour.
[02:19:23.035 --> 02:19:31.644]  With Webster Griffin Tarpley of Tarpley.net to get his view on Libya, his view on the Iran strike, his view on all of it.
[02:19:31.644 --> 02:19:39.954]  It was Tarpley back in 2007 said the Iran strike is on and we later learned Cheney did have it on until Fox Fallon and others resigned and it didn't happen.
[02:19:39.954 --> 02:19:42.596]  But we're right back to that point again as I told you two and a half weeks ago.
[02:19:43.217 --> 02:19:46.198]  And now it's admitted, Israel's getting ready to strike.
[02:19:46.198 --> 02:19:47.079]  Can it be stopped?
[02:19:47.079 --> 02:19:48.820]  We'll get to our police take on that.
[02:19:48.820 --> 02:19:51.641]  What will the ramifications of this new war be?
[02:19:51.641 --> 02:19:54.402]  The accelerating police state rollout and more.
[02:19:54.402 --> 02:20:01.165]  But whatever you do, get that URL and send it out to everybody to be part of this special 27-hour transmission.
[02:20:01.165 --> 02:20:05.387]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.
[02:20:05.387 --> 02:20:09.208]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.
[02:20:09.208 --> 02:20:12.450]  Midas Resources, a team of hand-picked financial specialists
[02:20:12.810 --> 02:20:13.350]  We're good to go.
[02:20:40.285 --> 02:20:46.468]  Get the facts and call Midas Resources toll free at 888-292-2709.
[02:20:46.468 --> 02:20:49.369]  That's 888-292-2709.
[02:20:49.369 --> 02:20:54.751]  And remember, if you read the Midas Report, you'll receive a free Walking Liberty silver half dollar.
[02:21:01.718 --> 02:21:03.018]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:21:03.018 --> 02:21:08.600]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:21:08.600 --> 02:21:13.622]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:21:13.622 --> 02:21:18.664]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:21:19.204 --> 02:21:24.428]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:21:24.428 --> 02:21:26.729]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[02:21:26.729 --> 02:21:31.532]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:21:31.532 --> 02:21:32.653]  And here's the best part.
[02:21:32.653 --> 02:21:35.735]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:21:35.735 --> 02:21:39.358]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:21:39.358 --> 02:21:42.540]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:21:42.540 --> 02:21:44.761]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:21:44.761 --> 02:21:45.682]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:21:49.324 --> 02:21:52.286]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:21:52.286 --> 02:21:58.389]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate martyr item.
[02:21:58.389 --> 02:22:02.131]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:22:02.131 --> 02:22:03.591]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:22:03.591 --> 02:22:09.434]  This holiday season, more than half of our nation is in need of help due to the shattered economy.
[02:22:09.434 --> 02:22:13.176]  So now is the time to express the holiday spirit more than ever.
[02:22:13.176 --> 02:22:16.498]  Consider helping those you love with the most important gift.
[02:22:16.498 --> 02:22:18.319]  A supply of delicious, easy to fix,
[02:22:18.319 --> 02:22:18.959]  We're good to go.
[02:22:44.764 --> 02:22:48.389]  At efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex to find the special.
[02:22:48.389 --> 02:22:54.258]  That's 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:22:54.258 --> 02:22:56.421]  You can bet your life on efoods direct.
[02:23:00.979 --> 02:23:03.501]  Big Berkey water filters are in high demand.
[02:23:03.501 --> 02:23:05.562]  Storable foods are also in high demand.
[02:23:05.562 --> 02:23:10.606]  BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com has always kept our focus on the Berkey water filter products.
[02:23:10.606 --> 02:23:14.309]  But increasingly, our customers have been asking for storable foods.
[02:23:14.309 --> 02:23:21.514]  After months of research, BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com now offers great tasting, long-lasting, storable foods.
[02:23:21.514 --> 02:23:25.097]  These ready-to-eat meals are packed in airtight nitrogen pouches.
[02:23:25.097 --> 02:23:26.418]  All you do is just add water.
[02:23:26.658 --> 02:23:30.560]  And because they're sealed so well, they come with a 25-year shelf life.
[02:23:30.560 --> 02:23:39.724]  Combine our Berkey water filters, which are powerful enough to purify treated, untreated, or even stagnant pond water with our storable foods, and you have a winning combination.
[02:23:39.724 --> 02:23:46.748]  Remember, we offer free shipping on every order over $50, and GCN listeners receive 5% off all ceramic filter systems.

[02:23:53.514 --> 02:24:06.987]  That's bigberkeywaterfilters.com or call 877-99-BERKEY today.
[02:24:06.987 --> 02:24:08.969]  Okay, we're going to Webster Griffin Tarpley.
[02:24:08.969 --> 02:24:10.630]  I guess this is a good problem to have.
[02:24:11.656 --> 02:24:16.119]  But the InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com site is crashed right now.
[02:24:16.119 --> 02:24:20.321]  We've got it on big server CDN systems.
[02:24:20.321 --> 02:24:24.723]  InfoWars.com is up, but it's getting massive traffic right now as well.
[02:24:24.723 --> 02:24:27.045]  And so you can update.
[02:24:28.177 --> 02:24:33.839]  And you can donate right on the front page of Infowars.com, PayPal, credit card, however you want.
[02:24:33.839 --> 02:24:35.419]  So the donations are really starting to come in.
[02:24:35.419 --> 02:24:37.100]  I want to thank all of you who have donated.
[02:24:37.100 --> 02:24:39.901]  I want to thank all of you who spread the word about the broadcast.
[02:24:39.901 --> 02:24:45.423]  I want to thank all of you who've been demonized and laughed at and told you're a liar when you warn folks about global government.
[02:24:45.423 --> 02:24:47.063]  Now it's all being announced.
[02:24:47.063 --> 02:24:50.424]  Because you cared about the truth more than being trendy.
[02:24:50.424 --> 02:24:51.825]  And you cared about free humanity.
[02:24:54.181 --> 02:24:58.663]  I told you NATO in September to early October was going to launch a ground defense of backing rebels.
[02:24:58.663 --> 02:24:59.704]  It happened.
[02:24:59.704 --> 02:25:01.845]  I told you they're getting ready for Iran two and a half weeks ago.
[02:25:01.845 --> 02:25:02.945]  Now they're admitting it.
[02:25:02.945 --> 02:25:04.026]  We know what we're talking about.
[02:25:04.026 --> 02:25:05.166]  This is a treasure.
[02:25:05.166 --> 02:25:06.627]  This show, our guest.
[02:25:06.627 --> 02:25:12.730]  I take you now to Webster Griffin-Tarpley, joining us via video Skype until five minutes into the next hour when Catherine Albrecht joins us.
[02:25:12.730 --> 02:25:14.030]  Webster, great to have you here.
[02:25:14.030 --> 02:25:15.071]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:25:15.071 --> 02:25:15.891]  How are you doing?
[02:25:15.891 --> 02:25:16.111]  Good.
[02:25:16.111 --> 02:25:19.253]  Give us your analysis on the Iran situation.
[02:25:19.253 --> 02:25:20.914]  Is it moving into green light phase?
[02:25:21.991 --> 02:25:23.792]  Well, it may be.
[02:25:23.792 --> 02:25:30.916]  We know that the Anglo-Americans, the imperialists, are appalled that their attack on Syria has broken down.
[02:25:30.916 --> 02:25:32.357]  It's going nowhere.
[02:25:32.357 --> 02:25:40.422]  Their design for this autumn was to have Libya go down, and they've succeeded maybe partially there, but not completely by any means.
[02:25:41.162 --> 02:25:56.172]  And now there's the question of Syria, and we know that this is difficult not to crack for them, because you've got this Russian naval base there at the port of Tartus, and you've got Iran next door, and you've got Hezbollah next door.
[02:25:56.172 --> 02:26:05.438]  So, the goal is to smash the government of President Assad of Syria using a group of really contemptible NATO puppets.
[02:26:05.438 --> 02:26:08.380]  They are the Muslim Brotherhood, they are death squads,
[02:26:08.900 --> 02:26:21.406]  They are openly calling, they're having demonstrations in the cities of Syria to the extent they can get anybody at all on the street, calling for NATO to rain down death and destruction on their own country.
[02:26:21.406 --> 02:26:25.847]  Can you imagine a demonstration that says, please NATO, bomb us!
[02:26:25.847 --> 02:26:26.568]  Bomb us now!
[02:26:27.528 --> 02:26:32.331]  I mean, it'd be like Americans in the streets going, Russia, please bomb America!
[02:26:32.331 --> 02:26:33.511]  It's unbelievable.
[02:26:33.511 --> 02:26:38.954]  And basically they're saying, we want civil war, we want NATO bombing, because that's what you get.
[02:26:38.954 --> 02:26:43.156]  As Secretary Gates said in a rare moment of candor before he left,
[02:26:43.656 --> 02:26:52.722]  The beginning of a no-fly zone is a comprehensive aerial bombardment with thousands and thousands of sorties of the country involved.
[02:26:52.722 --> 02:26:54.744]  So, this is now the problem.
[02:26:54.744 --> 02:26:59.187]  The Anglo-Americans, again, we're talking Obama, Hillary, Panetta.
[02:26:59.187 --> 02:27:03.570]  Remember, this country is now being run by the Principals Committee.
[02:27:03.570 --> 02:27:07.252]  Panetta, Hillary, General Petraeus.
[02:27:07.252 --> 02:27:10.775]  Be respectful, that's President Obama, Nobel Laureate for Peace.
[02:27:11.866 --> 02:27:15.727]  But again, the Principals Committee is where the stuff is really happening.
[02:27:15.727 --> 02:27:17.967]  Obama, by most accounts, is out of it.
[02:27:17.967 --> 02:27:31.191]  He simply, he gets his adulation when and where he can, and otherwise he retreats to the family living quarters of the White House and focuses on whatever sports event is on, or insulting people in his entourage.
[02:27:31.191 --> 02:27:32.291]  The question therefore is,
[02:27:33.075 --> 02:27:46.238]  Panetta, Hillary, General Petraeus, whom I regard as the dominant personality of this clique, along with Donilon, the head of the National Security Council, along with a couple of others, they're running the government.
[02:27:46.238 --> 02:27:47.398]  That's the Principals Committee.
[02:27:47.398 --> 02:27:48.979]  Now, what will they do?
[02:27:48.979 --> 02:27:54.580]  If you attack Syria, Syria has said they will retaliate directly against Israel.
[02:27:54.580 --> 02:27:57.381]  And they have very serious means of doing this now.
[02:27:57.381 --> 02:27:58.741]  They have heavy-duty
[02:27:59.501 --> 02:28:09.611]  Conventionally armed ballistic missiles, at least thought to be conventionally armed, maybe there's more that would show up on these missiles, and Iran would immediately therefore be involved.
[02:28:09.611 --> 02:28:15.117]  So this gets to look much more like World War III than the Libyan adventure that we've just seen.
[02:28:15.117 --> 02:28:17.339]  Although the Libyan adventure was a stepping stone,
[02:28:17.779 --> 02:28:23.820]  The problem for the Anglo-Americans is that they wanted to take Gaddafi out back in March, April, May.
[02:28:23.820 --> 02:28:24.581]  They failed.
[02:28:24.581 --> 02:28:33.383]  And Gaddafi, with his blocking position, has basically saved everybody else, Algeria and Syria in particular.
[02:28:33.383 --> 02:28:35.223]  So, this is now the situation.
[02:28:35.223 --> 02:28:42.865]  Now, I would say this ruling class, this imperialist ruling elite that we have, are mad as hatters.
[02:28:42.865 --> 02:28:45.606]  They're about as crazy as crazy can be.
[02:28:45.606 --> 02:28:46.506]  They're crazed
[02:28:47.286 --> 02:28:51.268]  Precisely because their derivatives castle is coming down, right?
[02:28:51.268 --> 02:28:56.851]  This huge, monstrous edifice of quadrillions of dollars worth of derivatives.
[02:28:56.851 --> 02:28:57.592]  And they're also...
[02:28:58.459 --> 02:29:05.703]  I think aware that their hold on power is now a little bit less firm than it had been before.
[02:29:05.703 --> 02:29:08.525]  In particular, I think we have to look at the mass strike.
[02:29:08.525 --> 02:29:19.812]  What the experience of recent years shows is that you cannot really organize a movement that can contend for power on the basis of anti-war issues only.
[02:29:19.812 --> 02:29:22.294]  You've also got to have economic issues.
[02:29:22.294 --> 02:29:24.635]  Now, let me just pull back from the East
[02:29:24.755 --> 02:29:27.076]  All right, stay there, but I want to go around the world.
[02:29:27.076 --> 02:29:28.257]  You've been to Libya recently.
[02:29:28.257 --> 02:29:30.578]  I want to look at what happened there.
[02:29:30.578 --> 02:29:33.959]  I want to look at Iran coming up and what will follow that.
[02:29:33.959 --> 02:29:39.642]  I want to look then at the economy, what's happening in Greece, what's happening in Europe with Dr. Tarpley, doctor of history.
[02:29:39.642 --> 02:29:41.022]  He's also an economist.
[02:29:41.022 --> 02:29:41.963]  I'm Alex Jones.

[02:29:50.846 --> 02:29:52.227]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.227 --> 02:29:53.708]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.742 --> 02:30:01.484]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.484 --> 02:30:09.586]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:30:09.586 --> 02:30:12.147]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:30:12.147 --> 02:30:17.529]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:30:17.529 --> 02:30:20.569]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:30:20.569 --> 02:30:22.630]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:30:22.870 --> 02:30:29.135]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:30:29.135 --> 02:30:32.517]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:30:32.517 --> 02:30:38.302]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:30:38.302 --> 02:30:39.943]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:30:39.943 --> 02:30:41.244]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:30:41.244 --> 02:30:43.906]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:30:43.906 --> 02:30:48.129]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:30:48.129 --> 02:30:50.711]  You can find the video at www dot
[02:30:50.851 --> 02:30:51.672]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.

[02:32:05.268 --> 02:32:06.529]  Tyranny is here.
[02:32:06.529 --> 02:32:10.231]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:32:10.231 --> 02:32:12.693]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:32:12.693 --> 02:32:18.116]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:32:18.556 --> 02:32:25.218]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:32:25.218 --> 02:32:31.201]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:32:31.201 --> 02:32:34.862]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:32:35.382 --> 02:32:39.666]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:32:39.666 --> 02:32:45.631]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:32:45.631 --> 02:32:49.174]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:32:49.174 --> 02:32:51.155]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:32:51.155 --> 02:32:52.276]  It's here.

[02:33:39.329 --> 02:33:43.111]  We're just now up at Infowars.com and prisonbonnet.com.
[02:33:43.111 --> 02:33:46.453]  Here soon, be able to send out a schedule of who's coming up.
[02:33:46.453 --> 02:33:48.714]  But let me just read to you who's coming up.
[02:33:48.714 --> 02:33:55.357]  Phil Skousen was on, Webster Tarpley's on now, Dr. Catherine Albrecht getting into all the internet censorship, the control grid, the spying systems.
[02:33:55.357 --> 02:33:57.018]  It's really exploded.
[02:33:57.018 --> 02:33:58.579]  George Norey needs no introduction.
[02:33:58.579 --> 02:34:00.980]  He's going to be joining us on coasttocoastam.com.
[02:34:00.980 --> 02:34:02.381]  David Icke needs no introduction.
[02:34:02.381 --> 02:34:07.944]  Mike Adams, Alfred Adask, Tex Mars, the Corbett Report.
[02:34:08.844 --> 02:34:20.587]  We've got Springmeyer, Aaron Dykes, Paul Watson, Reeves, a special on Skull & Bones, never-before-seen information, Gerald Cilente, Alan Watt, Jim Mars, Bob Chapman, and more.
[02:34:20.587 --> 02:34:22.307]  Dan Dix, the list goes on and on.
[02:34:22.307 --> 02:34:28.949]  Great job to the crew and great job to all the listeners out there who are helping get all this information out to everyone.
[02:34:30.009 --> 02:34:34.352]  And of course, in the run-up to this, we had Jesse Ventura and Dave Mustaine of Megadeth on yesterday.
[02:34:34.352 --> 02:34:38.974]  Jesse Ventura said the TSA is setting up martial law and he's lived under it in the Philippines.
[02:34:38.974 --> 02:34:42.697]  He said people ought to riot in the streets if they keep Ron Paul out of a third-party debate.
[02:34:42.697 --> 02:34:45.899]  He said he probably would run with Ron Paul if he asked him in a third party.
[02:34:45.899 --> 02:34:47.940]  Ron Paul said if he doesn't win the nomination, he may do that.
[02:34:48.380 --> 02:34:50.022]  He may run.
[02:34:50.022 --> 02:34:52.284]  The question is, will Ventura be involved?
[02:34:52.284 --> 02:34:53.606]  Wow!
[02:34:53.606 --> 02:34:55.067]  Also, he wrote a bunch of other stuff.
[02:34:55.067 --> 02:34:58.211]  That's all at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:34:58.211 --> 02:35:08.482]  Today, the InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com has the main free video stream of this 27-hour TV slash radio extravaganza against tyranny.
[02:35:10.023 --> 02:35:15.386]  But, and there's also three or four backups on there that isn't just our servers, but backups.
[02:35:15.386 --> 02:35:18.949]  The Moneybomb site has been up and down a little bit because of massive traffic.
[02:35:18.949 --> 02:35:23.571]  And I want to thank all those that are donating right now at infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[02:35:23.571 --> 02:35:25.833]  We will have open phones coming up later as well.
[02:35:25.833 --> 02:35:28.394]  Okay, getting back to Webster Griffin Tarpley.
[02:35:28.394 --> 02:35:34.438]  Webster, looking at all this, again, I'm asking you to make the call.
[02:35:34.438 --> 02:35:38.621]  We now learn, you were right in 2007 when you said it's been green-lighted the next month.
[02:35:39.261 --> 02:35:44.784]  But we now know the green light was taken off, Cheney was countermanded, so was certain elements in Israel.
[02:35:44.784 --> 02:35:55.309]  Now you got Netanyahu before the cabinet, you got the media, that hoax two and a half weeks ago of the Iranian used car salesman in Corpus Christi, Texas, turned out totally fake, run by...
[02:35:56.509 --> 02:35:57.049]  I don't know.
[02:36:15.797 --> 02:36:18.280]  Where Occupy Wall Street is not co-opted.
[02:36:18.280 --> 02:36:21.784]  Clearly they tried to co-opt it, but now they're attacking them nationwide.
[02:36:21.784 --> 02:36:24.488]  So that means they were not co-opted fully.
[02:36:24.488 --> 02:36:25.489]  And I want your view on that.
[02:36:25.489 --> 02:36:32.978]  I know you want to talk about solutions and your particular view on the American system, but I want your political analysis.
[02:36:32.978 --> 02:36:35.021]  Do you believe they're about to hit Iran?
[02:36:36.147 --> 02:36:43.891]  Well, the problem with attacking Iran right now that makes it more complicated than it might have been six months ago or eight months ago is that Putin is back.
[02:36:43.891 --> 02:36:48.094]  And I think if you go back to 2007, the incident that you're referring to, right?
[02:36:48.094 --> 02:36:52.997]  Cheney had been demanding an attack on Syria starting in June.
[02:36:52.997 --> 02:36:56.138]  I made this public based really just on analysis.
[02:36:56.138 --> 02:37:00.361]  No inside sources, just the pattern of events.
[02:37:00.361 --> 02:37:05.604]  By July, I was putting out this newspaper article, Cheney determined to strike in U.S.
[02:37:06.444 --> 02:37:28.794]  And then we had the rogue B-52 at the end of August and the beginning of September, which was an attempt by Cheney, and better, the group that he speaks for, to hijack a B-52 with six nuclear cruise missiles on board, fly that to the Middle East outside of the command and control of the United States, but in the command and control of the Wall Street invisible government, and start a war.
[02:37:29.734 --> 02:37:31.317]  What stopped that?
[02:37:31.317 --> 02:37:39.909]  When that B-52 reached the Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana, was the concern, I think, about Putin.
[02:37:39.909 --> 02:37:41.331]  How would Russia respond?
[02:37:41.331 --> 02:37:42.672]  What would they do?
[02:37:42.672 --> 02:37:44.956]  Not likely they're gonna start World War III, but...
[02:37:45.476 --> 02:37:50.978]  They would respond in some way that could be very, very painful and uncomfortable for the Anglo-Americans.
[02:37:50.978 --> 02:37:53.039]  So this is now a factor.
[02:37:53.039 --> 02:37:54.640]  But now we have a new factor.
[02:37:54.640 --> 02:37:56.160]  Let's look at the Port of Oakland.
[02:37:56.160 --> 02:37:58.641]  I believe it's the fifth largest port in the United States.
[02:37:58.641 --> 02:38:02.203]  That was shut down yesterday by people who were fighting Wall Street.
[02:38:02.203 --> 02:38:02.763]  Now whatever
[02:38:03.323 --> 02:38:18.054]  The particular program is, or was not, I recommend a program, the general idea is, we don't like the banks, we don't like Wall Street, and this is already a big step forward, because indeed, finance capital is everybody's public enemy number one.
[02:38:18.054 --> 02:38:19.395]  Wall Street is the enemy.
[02:38:20.115 --> 02:38:37.471]  So if the port of Oakland is shut down, even for a few hours, suppose other ports were shut down, what does that mean when the ruling class says, are we going to mount a large military operation in the eastern Mediterranean in the face of a movement that has now shown that it can shut down a port?
[02:38:37.471 --> 02:38:39.633]  There are plenty of historical examples for this.
[02:38:39.633 --> 02:38:42.215]  Mass strikes can stop foreign wars.
[02:38:42.715 --> 02:38:50.761]  Uh, you could say the attempt of the Allies after World War I to invade Soviet Russia was stopped by revolutionary ferment.
[02:38:50.761 --> 02:38:58.306]  Mass strikes with working class demands in countries of Europe and also to some extent in the United States.
[02:38:58.306 --> 02:38:58.627]  But now,
[02:39:00.127 --> 02:39:04.192]  Therefore, we have to say, what will Putin do, say?
[02:39:04.192 --> 02:39:06.514]  Will there be some kind of a move by Russia?
[02:39:06.514 --> 02:39:17.245]  There's already been the joint Russian-Chinese veto of the US-British attempt to get the attack on Syria approved in some form in the UN Security Council.
[02:39:17.245 --> 02:39:19.047]  But that is obviously not enough.
[02:39:19.047 --> 02:39:22.311]  The hysteria of the Anglo-Americans is even greater.
[02:39:22.771 --> 02:39:26.412]  Now, I have to pull back a little bit and move to another part of the Mediterranean.
[02:39:26.412 --> 02:39:28.612]  Now, we've got to talk about Greece for a minute.
[02:39:28.612 --> 02:39:30.373]  And we've got to talk about Cannes, right?
[02:39:30.373 --> 02:39:32.333]  We've got to talk about the G20, right?
[02:39:32.333 --> 02:39:37.934]  The heads of every top 20 countries in the world are now meeting on the French Riviera, right?
[02:39:37.934 --> 02:39:38.954]  The Côte d'Azur.
[02:39:38.954 --> 02:39:40.295]  So what's going on here?
[02:39:40.295 --> 02:39:43.895]  I think this is really interesting, what's happened in the last couple of days there.
[02:39:43.895 --> 02:39:46.976]  And it allows us to see what might be coming inside the United States.
[02:39:47.839 --> 02:40:02.846]  Greece, of course, is in financial trouble because it's being attacked by zombie bankers and hedge fund hyenas using credit default swaps and other means, with the help of the ratings agencies, which have to be regarded as an arm of intelligence.
[02:40:02.846 --> 02:40:07.508]  In other words, they're an arm of the intelligence community, and what they do is strategically targeted.
[02:40:07.508 --> 02:40:09.028]  They're also very corrupt.
[02:40:09.028 --> 02:40:11.029]  They do insider trading and all the rest of it.
[02:40:11.029 --> 02:40:12.410]  So Greece is in trouble.
[02:40:12.410 --> 02:40:14.791]  It is a somewhat artificial crisis, although
[02:40:15.351 --> 02:40:22.836]  Probably the Greek debt is somewhat larger than it needs to be, but it doesn't need to be this kind of a life-and-death crisis.
[02:40:22.836 --> 02:40:28.740]  Papandreou is the socialist Prime Minister of Greece, and he's been running this crisis the whole time.
[02:40:28.740 --> 02:40:31.682]  He's an agent of the International Monetary Fund.
[02:40:31.682 --> 02:40:36.045]  He represents the London and New York and other banks.
[02:40:36.045 --> 02:40:41.389]  It is impossible to run class defense when you've got an IMF agent
[02:40:42.149 --> 02:40:47.033]  Sitting at the top of the so-called progressive coalition, that's what the Greeks actually have.
[02:40:47.033 --> 02:40:50.496]  So the Greek labor movement has been wonderful.
[02:40:50.496 --> 02:40:58.623]  They've come up with a dozen or maybe 15 general strikes, but they haven't been able to even get Papandreou out, partly because of this stuff.
[02:40:58.623 --> 02:41:03.728]  Anarchists have come in and said, no, we want to have general assemblies and facilitators and all the rest of it.
[02:41:03.728 --> 02:41:04.929]  Let me stop you there, Webster.
[02:41:04.929 --> 02:41:06.250]  Webster Tarpley joining us.
[02:41:06.250 --> 02:41:08.132]  I mean, let's let's look at this here.
[02:41:08.712 --> 02:41:12.875]  What's going on with Pop Andreyov saying we're going to have a referendum or not?
[02:41:12.875 --> 02:41:14.896]  We are, we aren't, now we aren't.
[02:41:14.896 --> 02:41:16.217]  And we know he's a globalist.
[02:41:16.217 --> 02:41:18.039]  We know he's Goldman Sachs handled.
[02:41:18.039 --> 02:41:25.724]  We know that Greece supposedly owes a hundred billion, but they need 1.4 trillion, leveraged three times, almost a five trillion.
[02:41:25.724 --> 02:41:28.126]  We know this is all a giant stinking fraud.
[02:41:28.126 --> 02:41:34.770]  And then you've got the Vatican saying we need to punish those bankers with a new bank of the world and giving the bankers more power.
[02:41:37.212 --> 02:41:38.552]  Let's be granular, okay?
[02:41:38.552 --> 02:41:44.275]  Let's get into the details on that, because the idea of taxing Wall Street is the obvious thing to do.
[02:41:44.275 --> 02:41:46.015]  The question is, who gets the money?
[02:41:46.015 --> 02:41:47.676]  Now, there's a Delphic version of it.
[02:41:47.676 --> 02:41:55.180]  By the way, they then call that collectivism, but we're all paying tens of trillions in banker bailouts that's stolen.
[02:41:55.180 --> 02:41:59.241]  You're saying, actually claw back the money from these offshore crooks.
[02:41:59.241 --> 02:42:01.202]  And then they say, no, that's not free market.
[02:42:01.202 --> 02:42:04.984]  And Rush Limbaugh says, what is free market is giving all your money in banker bailout to them.
[02:42:05.909 --> 02:42:23.537]  The big issue going into this G20 in Cannes was that everybody in Europe, France, Germany, the European Commission, the Pope, you name it, as well as the whole trade union movement, they're demanding a tax on speculation, on speculative turnovers.
[02:42:24.077 --> 02:42:30.822]  Now, naturally, since these people are bad, they have a version of this which is not quite the right one.
[02:42:30.822 --> 02:42:35.886]  Nevertheless, the idea of bringing this forward is letting a powerful genie out of the bottle.
[02:42:35.886 --> 02:42:52.459]  And you can tell that the controlled media, the so-called mainstream media in the United States, never talk about the demand for the Tobin tax, the Wall Street sales tax, the Robin Hood tax, I guess some people call it, not a good term for it, the financial transaction tax.
[02:42:53.219 --> 02:43:02.069]  The point is, you put a 1% tax on Wall Street turnover, which is in the quadrillions, and you get trillions of dollars for the public till.
[02:43:02.069 --> 02:43:04.932]  That means you don't need genocidal budget cuts.
[02:43:04.932 --> 02:43:09.917]  You don't need to kill your own people in the name of a balanced budget that you're not going to get to anyway.
[02:43:09.917 --> 02:43:12.840]  But now, the news of the past six hours or so,
[02:43:13.440 --> 02:43:19.185]  Papandreou had said, since my government is about to collapse, I'm going to call for a referendum.
[02:43:19.185 --> 02:43:21.087]  I'm going to let the Greeks vote on this.
[02:43:21.087 --> 02:43:35.099]  And this was a blackmail referendum, because it basically says, either you embrace genocidal austerity and years and years of suffering and grinding poverty and want and misery for the sake of the zombie bankers in Germany and France,
[02:43:35.179 --> 02:43:35.639]  Thank you.
[02:43:54.191 --> 02:43:58.494]  Now this was, it's clear now, this was a maneuver by Papandreou, the IMF agent.
[02:43:58.494 --> 02:44:10.242]  Today, he makes a speech in the Greek Parliament saying, I don't need to have a referendum as long as I can get the Greek right-wing opposition to agree with me in a national unity government.
[02:44:10.242 --> 02:44:11.043]  Now I want to stop you.
[02:44:11.043 --> 02:44:21.110]  What you're saying here is the banksters didn't want Greece to default until the Euro deal had gone through to give the banksters 5 trillion and more power over the states.
[02:44:21.830 --> 02:44:27.313]  Now that they've done that, now they do want to have a default to create even more carnage.
[02:44:27.313 --> 02:44:28.894]  No, I wouldn't put it that way.
[02:44:28.894 --> 02:44:36.238]  They're trying to stave off default by, as you say, this whole idea of the European Financial Stability Fund.
[02:44:36.238 --> 02:44:39.900]  It's about 500 trillion, sorry, 500 billion, and they want to use
[02:44:42.621 --> 02:44:43.241]  Derivatives.
[02:44:43.241 --> 02:44:45.782]  They want to use credit default swaps and other derivatives.
[02:44:45.782 --> 02:44:47.523]  In other words, the cause of the crisis.
[02:44:47.523 --> 02:44:53.865]  They want to use that to increase the firepower, as they say, of the EFSF, the European Financial Stability Fund.
[02:44:53.865 --> 02:44:55.326]  This is all crazy.
[02:44:55.326 --> 02:44:58.647]  It's physically impossible for the Greeks to pay that debt.
[02:44:58.647 --> 02:44:59.748]  No, exactly, Webster.
[02:44:59.748 --> 02:45:03.049]  It's physically impossible and we've covered all this ground before.
[02:45:03.689 --> 02:45:24.364]  Wait, the new thing, this is what's coming at you, right, coming at all of us right now, is this model where Papandreou says to the head of the New Democracy Party, who are the reactionaries, right, they're like the Republicans, this is a party that has been sitting on the sidelines and sniping, that's sort of what the Republicans do in Congress.
[02:45:24.364 --> 02:45:31.570]  Now, Papandreou turns to this guy Samaras and says to him, join me in a national unity government.
[02:45:31.570 --> 02:45:32.731]  It's going to be the
[02:45:33.311 --> 02:45:36.573]  PASOK, the socialists, and the reactionaries together.
[02:45:36.573 --> 02:45:39.474]  Now, what would that mean here in the U.S.?
[02:45:39.474 --> 02:45:46.258]  It would mean a national unity government of Obama and the Republicans.
[02:45:46.258 --> 02:45:47.658]  And where would that occur?
[02:45:47.658 --> 02:45:48.739]  Where could that take shape?
[02:45:49.783 --> 02:45:50.924]  The 12 tyrants.
[02:45:50.924 --> 02:45:52.025]  This is the thing.
[02:45:52.025 --> 02:45:55.808]  The 12 tyrants are going on behind the scenes, right?
[02:45:55.808 --> 02:46:06.556]  I'm talking about the congressional super committee created by this rotten, despicable compromise that both parties agreed to after the debt crisis, right?
[02:46:06.556 --> 02:46:13.081]  At the end of July, beginning of August, with the threat by the reactionaries to drive the country into bankruptcy.
[02:46:13.081 --> 02:46:15.342]  One of the results of that was to create this group of 12
[02:46:17.004 --> 02:46:26.877]  Members of Congress, right, six Republican hacks, six Democratic hacks, right, six reactionary Republicans, and six Wall Street Democrats, and they are now working behind the scenes.
[02:46:26.877 --> 02:46:29.681]  The chairs are Patty Murray of Washington State,
[02:46:30.433 --> 02:46:36.379]  Wall Street Democrat and Hensarling, congressman from Texas, reactionary Republican.
[02:46:36.379 --> 02:46:52.676]  Now if you look at the model that's being launched for Greece of the national unity government to push genocidal austerity, to ram genocidal austerity down the throats of people, the form in which this would occur here in the United States is on November 23rd
[02:46:54.190 --> 02:47:05.076]  The 12 tyrants, the super committee, come forward with their solution and they say, well, we were supposed to come up with 1.2 trillion of genocidal budget cuts against the American people.
[02:47:05.076 --> 02:47:06.416]  But that's not enough.
[02:47:06.416 --> 02:47:14.520]  We're going to have 4 trillion, 5 trillion of genocidal budget cuts so that we can please Standard & Poor's and Moody's and Fitch.
[02:47:14.520 --> 02:47:19.323]  And that would then be the precursor for some kind of a rotten deal along these lines.
[02:47:19.323 --> 02:47:23.445]  But Webster, we need to quantify this for new listeners.
[02:47:24.125 --> 02:47:34.457]  The point is, you can't pay back the $1,500 plus trillion in garbage that criminal government has signed us onto that isn't our debts.
[02:47:39.903 --> 02:47:47.890]  What the government did was to deregulate it, because again, from 1936 to 1982, derivatives were strictly illegal, and they should stay illegal.
[02:47:47.890 --> 02:47:54.476]  Yes, but then expanding on that, the bipartisan crooks that did this, bought and paid for by these criminal elements in Wall Street,
[02:47:55.310 --> 02:48:13.882]  They've now done this, and now they've got the Super Congress, and you notice they're slashing all the infrastructure, but then raising taxes to pay it to them, and the destination is the journey they mean to impoverish us in the post-industrial eugenics religion that they publicly follow.
[02:48:13.882 --> 02:48:19.766]  The tropism, as you've called it, the suicide bankers, who are just destroying the system in the name of total power.
[02:48:19.766 --> 02:48:20.967]  So the question is,
[02:48:22.202 --> 02:48:25.605]  Expanding on this, why do they want the war now?
[02:48:25.605 --> 02:48:27.367]  To make it a political diversion?
[02:48:27.367 --> 02:48:28.448]  I mean, what do you make of this?
[02:48:28.448 --> 02:48:31.751]  I have to keep going back to this Iran thing, because that's the big immediate deal.
[02:48:31.751 --> 02:48:40.900]  That'll be the patriotic diversion while we're in a new big war, while the bankers can rob us blind, while we're busy watching this.
[02:48:40.900 --> 02:48:42.001]  The Israeli Prime Minister
[02:48:42.842 --> 02:48:43.602]  Well, whether they want it 100%
[02:49:12.518 --> 02:49:15.240]  Beyond the theater, I think, is still a bit of an open question.
[02:49:15.240 --> 02:49:22.986]  And again, it's harder for them to do it because we got rid of the, at least, we're on the way to getting rid of the weak, lame-duck Yedev.
[02:49:22.986 --> 02:49:31.812]  And indeed, part of this whole scenario may be to prevent Putin from making the full comeback that they also hate and fear.
[02:49:31.812 --> 02:49:33.313]  But here's the idea.
[02:49:33.313 --> 02:49:39.217]  If you have such a war with Iran, the response of Iran is to close the Straits of Hormuz, right?
[02:49:39.217 --> 02:49:40.018]  Cutting off oil.
[02:49:40.638 --> 02:49:43.600]  That oil, if it's cut off, destroys who?
[02:49:43.600 --> 02:49:47.542]  It destroys Europe, Japan, and above all, China.
[02:49:47.542 --> 02:49:49.744]  And it drives up the price of the dollar.
[02:49:49.744 --> 02:49:56.008]  It creates a huge increase in the price of oil, and since the dollar is still a reserve currency,
[02:49:56.781 --> 02:50:08.192]  This means that you have a tremendous artificial demand for dollars, and they say, well, if we have a nice little war in the Persian Gulf, then the Iranians will do us the favor of cutting off the tanker traffic.
[02:50:08.192 --> 02:50:19.463]  That will mean the price of oil goes to $500 or $1,000 a barrel, and at that point the dollar overhang is absorbed out of the liquidity that's sloshing around.
[02:50:19.463 --> 02:50:20.744]  All roads lead to war.
[02:50:21.565 --> 02:50:23.248]  It's the health of the state, as they say.
[02:50:23.248 --> 02:50:27.434]  This is what these type of crooks always do.
[02:50:27.434 --> 02:50:30.318]  So, do you believe it's imminent, or are you saying it's not?
[02:50:31.172 --> 02:50:43.245]  To coin a phrase, turn the imperialist foreign war into a revolutionary civil conflict, let's say, to a revolutionary social movement at home, to embroider a previously existing phrase.
[02:50:43.245 --> 02:50:52.354]  In other words, the answer to all this, if you want to build mass resistance to this, you've got to do it with demands that have actual mass traction, and that's where you get
[02:50:53.075 --> 02:50:57.277]  The Wall Street sales tax of 1% means no cuts.
[02:50:57.277 --> 02:51:00.099]  No to the recipes coming from the 12 tyrants.
[02:51:00.099 --> 02:51:01.580]  All right, stay there!
[02:51:01.580 --> 02:51:08.904]  Did you know nuclear radiation is still spewing out of the melted-down reactors in Fukushima, Japan, and making its way across the entire U.S.
[02:51:08.904 --> 02:51:11.925]  continent, contaminating the air, water, and food?
[02:51:11.925 --> 02:51:14.647]  Dangerously high levels of radiation are a reality here.
[02:51:14.927 --> 02:51:19.712]  As a result, radiation poisoning is a distinct possibility for anyone living in the U.S.
[02:51:19.712 --> 02:51:21.915]  unless you do something to protect yourself.
[02:51:21.915 --> 02:51:22.475]  How?
[02:51:22.475 --> 02:51:25.719]  With Liquid Zeolite from RestoreYourHealthNow.com.
[02:51:25.719 --> 02:51:30.484]  Without a doubt, Liquid Zeolite is by far the best product to remove radiation from your body.
[02:51:30.484 --> 02:51:33.427]  It safely removes toxins and heavy metals, boosts energy levels,
[02:51:33.527 --> 02:51:33.727]  Thank you.
[02:52:02.682 --> 02:52:07.366]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[02:52:07.366 --> 02:52:13.813]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[02:52:13.813 --> 02:52:16.075]  Number one, study the past.
[02:52:16.075 --> 02:52:18.477]  History really does repeat itself.
[02:52:18.477 --> 02:52:22.200]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[02:52:23.311 --> 02:52:26.414]  Number three, take decisive action.
[02:52:26.414 --> 02:52:30.257]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[02:52:30.257 --> 02:52:35.301]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[02:52:35.301 --> 02:52:38.724]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[02:52:39.304 --> 02:52:42.708]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[02:52:42.708 --> 02:52:47.213]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:52:47.213 --> 02:52:52.138]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[02:52:52.138 --> 02:52:56.764]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:52:56.764 --> 02:52:58.946]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:53:00.916 --> 02:53:05.459]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:53:05.459 --> 02:53:06.379]  Number 1.
[02:53:06.379 --> 02:53:09.802]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:53:09.802 --> 02:53:10.662]  Number 2.
[02:53:10.662 --> 02:53:15.545]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:53:15.545 --> 02:53:16.306]  It's true.
[02:53:16.306 --> 02:53:21.169]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:53:21.169 --> 02:53:21.989]  Number 3.
[02:53:21.989 --> 02:53:25.572]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:53:25.572 --> 02:53:29.274]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:53:29.474 --> 02:53:30.275]  Number 4.
[02:53:30.275 --> 02:53:33.037]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:53:33.037 --> 02:53:36.721]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:53:36.721 --> 02:53:37.522]  Number 5.
[02:53:37.522 --> 02:53:41.665]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:53:41.665 --> 02:53:46.410]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:53:46.710 --> 02:53:50.876]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[02:54:29.288 --> 02:54:42.062]  I'm taking the plane, I said I'll never give it up This ain't at all, I'm a young and kind of proud
[02:54:47.907 --> 02:54:50.028]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[02:54:50.028 --> 02:54:54.851]  By the way, we had the donation line where it kind of went into voicemail Hades.
[02:54:54.851 --> 02:54:57.412]  Now it just goes directly to the InfoWars crews.

[02:55:10.179 --> 02:55:10.659]  It's simple.
[02:55:10.659 --> 02:55:13.081]  The globalists take your money and use it against you.
[02:55:13.081 --> 02:55:20.385]  We're saying donate if you want us to expand the nightly news, expand the shows, expand the reporters and everything we're doing.
[02:55:20.385 --> 02:55:32.371]  The most important thing to do, and a lot of folks are watching it right now, is to go to Infowars.com and send the link out that talks about the 24 or 27 hour transmission out to everyone you know.
[02:55:32.371 --> 02:55:33.852]  Again, it is available.
[02:55:34.472 --> 02:55:37.333]  Uh, right now at Infowars.com.
[02:55:37.333 --> 02:55:40.633]  And let me just tell you the schedule verbally here, everybody.
[02:55:40.633 --> 02:55:41.673]  Joel Scalzo was on.
[02:55:41.673 --> 02:55:42.914]  We're with Webster Tarpley.
[02:55:42.914 --> 02:55:44.174]  Kathryn Albrecht's coming up.
[02:55:44.174 --> 02:56:01.637]  George Norrie, David Icke, Mike Adams, Tex Mars, uh, the, uh, Corbett Report folks, Springmeyer, Aaron Dykes, Paul Watson, Richard Reeves, uh, Gerald Salente, Alan Watt, Jim Mars, uh, and, uh, Bob Chapman and many others.
[02:56:01.637 --> 02:56:03.458]  We're broadcasting right through
[02:56:04.497 --> 02:56:07.199]  Right through until 2 o'clock tomorrow.
[02:56:07.199 --> 02:56:09.020]  2 o'clock tomorrow.
[02:56:09.020 --> 02:56:10.681]  2 o'clock tomorrow.
[02:56:10.681 --> 02:56:11.862]  And then, of course, 2 p.m.
[02:56:11.862 --> 02:56:12.502]  Central.
[02:56:12.502 --> 02:56:15.604]  And then, of course, we have the Sunday transmission, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:56:15.604 --> 02:56:16.985]  and back on Monday.
[02:56:17.967 --> 02:56:18.167]  here.
[02:56:48.528 --> 02:56:51.630]  You know Webster, I've studied what the communist Chinese do.
[02:56:51.630 --> 02:56:53.211]  I don't know why the left loves them so much.
[02:56:53.211 --> 02:56:54.933]  They execute homosexuals over there.
[02:56:54.933 --> 02:57:03.360]  I saw some person dressed up in a Mao outfit at an Occupy Wall Street deal saying he loves Mao because he's gay and America doesn't like him.
[02:57:03.360 --> 02:57:04.561]  They go over there, they'd murder him.
[02:57:04.561 --> 02:57:07.444]  I'm not talking about the general Chinese people, but the government.
[02:57:08.324 --> 02:57:11.927]  Uh, we've got, uh, you've got Russia incredibly corrupt.
[02:57:11.927 --> 02:57:14.029]  I mean, I don't romanticize any of this.
[02:57:14.029 --> 02:57:15.750]  You've got the corrupt banks running us.
[02:57:15.750 --> 02:57:20.153]  It's just all a bunch of crooks fighting with each other while we the people are on the bottom of it.
[02:57:20.153 --> 02:57:23.316]  You've got the Iranians that have had their government overthrown over and over again.
[02:57:23.316 --> 02:57:26.338]  You've got all this stuff happening.
[02:57:26.338 --> 02:57:32.383]  Uh, and, uh, I agree the, the, the Western elite is in crisis, but so are the others Webster.
[02:57:32.383 --> 02:57:34.124]  And I just see this going from bad to worse.
[02:57:34.124 --> 02:57:34.945]  What's your comment on that?
[02:57:35.546 --> 02:57:38.548]  Let's look at the tactical and strategic situation.
[02:57:38.548 --> 02:57:40.029]  We have the bad, right?
[02:57:40.029 --> 02:57:48.375]  The bad would be Sarkozy, Merkel, and this crew with lots and lots of others attached to them.
[02:57:48.375 --> 02:57:49.936]  And then we have the worst.
[02:57:49.936 --> 02:57:54.198]  And the worst are Obama, Hillary, Geithner, Bernanke.
[02:57:54.198 --> 02:57:55.820]  We've got Cameron in London.
[02:57:55.820 --> 02:57:58.241]  We've got Osborne, the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
[02:57:58.241 --> 02:57:59.302]  Those guys are the worst.
[02:57:59.682 --> 02:58:06.488]  Because they represent the most virulent, destructive form of speculative finance capital the world has ever seen, right?
[02:58:06.488 --> 02:58:08.329]  The derivative center, London.
[02:58:08.329 --> 02:58:14.234]  I was on TV yesterday with a guy who said, London is the center, the premier financial center of the world.
[02:58:15.311 --> 02:58:17.392]  And they mean to keep that, okay?
[02:58:17.392 --> 02:58:19.012]  And the world be damned.
[02:58:19.012 --> 02:58:28.516]  So, when you see the bad fighting the worst, it's something good, first of all, because it diminishes the net amount of evil in the world.
[02:58:28.516 --> 02:58:33.538]  But at that point, it's better to see the bad win out over the worst.
[02:58:33.538 --> 02:58:36.819]  And specifically, the fight is about this Wall Street sales tax.
[02:58:36.819 --> 02:58:37.239]  Stay there.
[02:58:37.239 --> 02:58:38.179]  Five more minutes, Webster.
[02:58:38.179 --> 02:58:38.939]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:38.939 --> 02:58:39.280]  Stay with us.
[02:58:43.226 --> 02:58:46.709]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:58:52.233 --> 02:58:57.677]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:58:57.677 --> 02:59:04.022]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:59:04.022 --> 02:59:10.747]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:59:12.742 --> 02:59:18.781]  They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you love the way they fit
[02:59:30.911 --> 02:59:33.052]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:59:33.052 --> 02:59:34.833]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:59:34.833 --> 02:59:37.714]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:59:37.714 --> 02:59:41.955]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[02:59:41.955 --> 02:59:44.356]  So you can ride all day with confidence.

[02:59:47.037 --> 02:59:48.638]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:59:48.638 --> 02:59:49.418]  Got it.
[02:59:49.418 --> 02:59:50.279]  Others don't.
[02:59:52.631 --> 02:59:54.174]  Coast to Coast.
[02:59:54.174 --> 02:59:56.218]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:56.218 --> 02:59:59.424]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:24.588 --> 03:00:29.010]  All right, we are into our number four, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:00:29.010 --> 03:00:32.132]  Katherine Albrecht is going to be joining us.
[03:00:32.132 --> 03:00:34.873]  She's an expert on the Big Brother Takeover of Society.
[03:00:34.873 --> 03:00:38.595]  I want to cover the waterfront with her joining us.
[03:00:38.595 --> 03:00:44.478]  And then we've got Mike Adams coming up, David Icke, George Norrie, Tex Mars, Alfred Adask.
[03:00:44.478 --> 03:00:49.261]  I mean, the list just goes on and on with this 27-hour marathon worldwide transmission.
[03:00:50.523 --> 03:00:54.006]  The websites are PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com.
[03:00:54.006 --> 03:00:55.086]  Finishing up with Webster.
[03:00:55.086 --> 03:00:58.989]  Webster, yes, I understand the tax on Wall Street.
[03:00:58.989 --> 03:01:00.310]  But see, that's a general thing.
[03:01:00.310 --> 03:01:04.393]  When I go down to these Wall Street events, they tell me, get your Ron Paul signs out of here.
[03:01:04.393 --> 03:01:05.494]  This is freedom.
[03:01:05.494 --> 03:01:07.375]  And we love George Soros.
[03:01:07.375 --> 03:01:10.538]  And we're going to tax anybody making $100,000 or more.
[03:01:10.538 --> 03:01:14.361]  I understand some of the groups are saying a speculation tax.
[03:01:14.361 --> 03:01:16.502]  Those guys are on the Soros payroll.
[03:01:16.502 --> 03:01:18.804]  Look, I would suggest people to do three things.
[03:01:19.424 --> 03:01:24.108]  Let's highlight one election next week, right?
[03:01:24.108 --> 03:01:26.209]  Election day next Tuesday.
[03:01:26.209 --> 03:01:27.350]  City of Philadelphia.
[03:01:27.350 --> 03:01:28.811]  County of Philadelphia.
[03:01:28.811 --> 03:01:29.892]  Sheriff.
[03:01:29.892 --> 03:01:32.994]  Sherry Hunkala running for Sheriff of Philadelphia.
[03:01:32.994 --> 03:01:34.916]  What's the problem she sees?
[03:01:34.916 --> 03:01:37.478]  Bank of America steals people's homes.
[03:01:37.478 --> 03:01:41.481]  They have robo-judges, robo-cops, robo-signers, robo-sheriffs.
[03:01:41.481 --> 03:01:43.102]  They come and steal your home.
[03:01:43.102 --> 03:01:44.543]  Maybe you have no mortgage.
[03:01:44.543 --> 03:01:45.724]  Maybe you missed one payment.
[03:01:46.244 --> 03:01:47.705]  They're there to steal it, right?
[03:01:47.705 --> 03:01:51.208]  Private property at risk from the attacks of Bank of America.
[03:01:51.208 --> 03:01:54.431]  So Sherry Honkel is running for Sheriff of Philadelphia.
[03:01:54.431 --> 03:01:57.654]  Her platform is no foreclosures, no evictions.
[03:01:57.654 --> 03:01:58.434]  No, no, I love it.
[03:01:58.434 --> 03:01:59.375]  That's solutions.
[03:01:59.375 --> 03:02:03.419]  When banks break the law, grand juries should indict them and they should go to prison.
[03:02:03.419 --> 03:02:04.059]  Right.
[03:02:04.059 --> 03:02:08.663]  And they should have the tens of trillions they've stolen clawed back and paid back into the Treasury.
[03:02:08.663 --> 03:02:10.304]  I totally agree with you.
[03:02:10.304 --> 03:02:12.246]  That's a real solution.
[03:02:12.246 --> 03:02:13.207]  Arrest the bankers.
[03:02:13.760 --> 03:02:20.065]  Alright, but this is also, don't carry out their orders to steal people's homes and throw American families out on the streets.
[03:02:20.065 --> 03:02:22.247]  This is a lady who's been homeless herself.
[03:02:22.247 --> 03:02:23.388]  She's a long-term activist.
[03:02:23.388 --> 03:02:27.591]  So I urge people to support Sherry Hunkala for Sheriff of Philadelphia.
[03:02:27.591 --> 03:02:29.153]  She needs money, she needs volunteers.
[03:02:29.153 --> 03:02:35.458]  Yeah, but I'm saying that general idea, Webster, of getting good sheriffs in, Sheriff Mack has, of course, pioneered that idea.
[03:02:35.458 --> 03:02:36.599]  That's a great idea.
[03:02:37.259 --> 03:02:40.762]  Okay, number two, if you're in Ohio, vote against Kasich.
[03:02:40.762 --> 03:02:42.984]  Kasich wants to bust all the unions.
[03:02:42.984 --> 03:02:49.610]  If you bust all the unions, for God's sake, then there are no mass organizations that can resist totalitarian government.
[03:02:49.610 --> 03:02:54.894]  What kind of a logic is it that says, smash the unions, and then everything will be hunky-dory?
[03:02:54.894 --> 03:03:03.782]  Those are the only things that come even close to being mass organizations that could call a general strike to stop a war, to stop a fascist coup, or God knows what.
[03:03:04.342 --> 03:03:10.706]  And the third thing, if you're a Democrat in particular, or an independent, and you're interested in the Obama question, right?
[03:03:10.706 --> 03:03:21.773]  If you want to register your opposition to Obama, that he should be dumped as a failure in the Wall Street puppet, primaryobamanow.com, primaryobamanaow.com.
[03:03:21.773 --> 03:03:28.176]  So there, I think, between those, among those three things, just about, there's something for everybody that they can do, right?
[03:03:28.176 --> 03:03:29.077]  Because the big thing is,
[03:03:29.637 --> 03:03:30.177]  Action.
[03:03:30.177 --> 03:03:38.201]  And again, if you don't like the fact that Soros' facilitators are dominating the Occupy where you are, get out there with the program.
[03:03:38.201 --> 03:03:48.985]  Wall Street sales tax, stop foreclosures, student loan amnesty, cancel it all, no cuts, no to the 12 tyrants, and seize the Federal Reserve.
[03:03:48.985 --> 03:03:51.526]  Let's start laying a glove on the Federal Reserve.
[03:03:51.526 --> 03:03:52.807]  Nationalize them.
[03:03:52.807 --> 03:03:55.908]  Make them cough up $1 trillion of 0% 100-year credit,
[03:03:57.649 --> 03:04:01.771]  We can rebuild the United States with successive blocks of those trillions.
[03:04:01.771 --> 03:04:06.093]  We need to create 30 million new productive jobs at union wages.
[03:04:06.093 --> 03:04:09.835]  And we're sick of austerity, because the austerity goes to the bankers, right?
[03:04:09.835 --> 03:04:12.436]  We don't want genocide against the American people.
[03:04:12.936 --> 03:04:15.577]  The budget will never be balanced with those methods, right?
[03:04:15.577 --> 03:04:18.538]  The champion of our austerity is Papandreou.
[03:04:18.538 --> 03:04:21.479]  The more he cuts, the bigger the deficit gets.
[03:04:21.479 --> 03:04:25.680]  How many times, how many people do we have to kill before that becomes obvious, right?
[03:04:25.680 --> 03:04:27.401]  Schwarzenegger, the same story.
[03:04:27.401 --> 03:04:33.363]  And remember, today is the day called by the National Nurses United and other groups
[03:04:33.863 --> 03:04:37.205]  Get out there and fight for the Wall Street sales tax, whatever you want to call it.
[03:04:37.205 --> 03:04:39.167]  The main thing is, it goes to the U.S.
[03:04:39.167 --> 03:04:43.749]  Treasury, and it goes to the states, so that the states can maintain vital services.
[03:04:43.749 --> 03:04:51.955]  We don't need to have cops, teachers, healthcare workers, first responders fired, simply because Koch and Soros want their bailouts.
[03:04:51.955 --> 03:04:54.216]  Alright, Webster, thanks for spending time with us.
[03:04:54.216 --> 03:04:55.717]  Ladies and gentlemen, Catherine Albrecht.
[03:04:55.717 --> 03:04:56.698]  Best of luck, Alex.
[03:04:56.698 --> 03:04:57.678]  Thank you, Webster.
[03:04:57.678 --> 03:04:59.119]  Thank you so much.
[03:04:59.119 --> 03:04:59.820]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:59.820 --> 03:05:01.161]  Stay with us at fullwars.com.
[03:05:01.861 --> 03:05:05.906]  For centuries, silver has been used as a powerful natural antibiotic.

[03:06:06.057 --> 03:06:07.557]  Everyone can feel it.
[03:06:07.557 --> 03:06:16.440]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[03:06:16.440 --> 03:06:19.881]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising.
[03:06:19.881 --> 03:06:20.921]  But take heart.
[03:06:20.921 --> 03:06:24.722]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[03:06:24.722 --> 03:06:29.703]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war.
[03:06:30.123 --> 03:06:33.966]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[03:06:33.966 --> 03:06:35.687]  The globalists are scared.
[03:06:35.687 --> 03:06:37.028]  They've overreached.
[03:06:37.028 --> 03:06:40.530]  The future of the info war is in your hands.

[03:06:55.921 --> 03:06:58.203]  We are going to use their system against them.
[03:06:58.203 --> 03:06:59.484]  The info war now.
[03:07:01.545 --> 03:07:03.707]  Is your credit card debt out of control?
[03:07:03.707 --> 03:07:06.489]  Are you in over your head dealing with monthly payments?
[03:07:06.489 --> 03:07:10.312]  There's a powerful secret that credit card companies don't want you to know.
[03:07:10.312 --> 03:07:17.198]  If you have credit card debt, you have the power to settle that debt for a fraction of what you owe, cutting your payments by up to half or more.

[03:08:03.140 --> 03:08:09.775]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:09.775 --> 03:08:12.762]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:26.440 --> 03:08:33.785]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, we are now into the fourth hour of this 27-hour transmission.
[03:08:33.785 --> 03:08:42.811]  I am your guest host, I guess, for this hour, Alex Jones, because coming up later in the middle of the night, we're going to have Aaron Dykes as a guest host.
[03:08:42.811 --> 03:08:47.715]  We're going to have Paul Watson as a guest host as well.
[03:08:47.715 --> 03:08:52.498]  But guest hosting with us this hour is Katherine Albrecht, Dr. Katherine Albrecht.
[03:08:52.498 --> 03:08:54.239]  Her website is KatherineAlbrecht.com.
[03:08:55.438 --> 03:08:59.519]  She's a popular commentator and, of course, radio personality here on Genesis.
[03:08:59.519 --> 03:09:02.899]  She's authored and co-authored six books and films.
[03:09:02.899 --> 03:09:08.520]  And, of course, she's also a Harvard graduate studying all of this garbage.
[03:09:08.520 --> 03:09:14.402]  She's helped really expose the whole RFID system, the police state control grid.
[03:09:14.402 --> 03:09:21.403]  My only problem today is really getting into the full magnitude
[03:09:24.387 --> 03:09:33.977]  Of just open flaunting of classical Big Brother corruption and tyranny in this country.
[03:09:33.977 --> 03:09:40.063]  It really is staggering to behold it.
[03:09:40.063 --> 03:09:45.869]  All over the nation, I've known for 13 years, they've put up streetlights that have cameras and microphones hidden in them.
[03:09:47.876 --> 03:09:52.839]  For 17 years they've listened to all the cell phones in real time and tracked everywhere you go.
[03:09:52.839 --> 03:10:01.183]  For 40 years, it'll be 40 years next year, worldwide and industrialized nations, they've taken blood at birth and put it in a secret UN database.
[03:10:01.183 --> 03:10:04.745]  We of course broke that 16 years ago with the documents, now it's news the last three.
[03:10:07.413 --> 03:10:20.880]  RFID, tracker chips, smart dust, Google watching people over microphones and cameras on phones, schools watching children, telescreens everywhere saying spy on your neighbors, only trust the government.
[03:10:20.880 --> 03:10:25.043]  It's like waking up in a nightmare science fiction movie is the way I've described it.
[03:10:26.025 --> 03:10:31.149]  And now they've gone from denying they were spying on us without warrants to just saying, this is the way it is.
[03:10:31.149 --> 03:10:38.615]  And Katherine Albrecht has a great way, you know, with words to really break down how you're not just going to Google and getting something from them.
[03:10:38.615 --> 03:10:40.756]  They're finding out who you are, what you're doing.
[03:10:40.756 --> 03:10:43.158]  They're creating algorithms on you.
[03:10:43.158 --> 03:10:49.343]  They're integrating with larger systems to literally be able to predict the future.
[03:10:49.343 --> 03:10:50.584]  All of that is going on.
[03:10:52.180 --> 03:10:54.163]  And that's why the elite are on such power trips.
[03:10:54.163 --> 03:11:02.012]  They admit now they see it as a type of crystal ball system to control the population.
[03:11:04.229 --> 03:11:05.509]  I also saw a report yesterday.
[03:11:05.509 --> 03:11:06.610]  Richard Reeves brought it to me.
[03:11:06.610 --> 03:11:10.431]  I was going to cover it on the nightly news and then it disappeared out of my stack.
[03:11:10.431 --> 03:11:17.892]  But he had reports that they're actually talking about pulling the smart meters in California because they use wireless cell phone technology type systems because of the health effects.
[03:11:17.892 --> 03:11:24.114]  California has been forced, along with a lot of Europe, to admit that they're causing problems and cell phones are linked to cancer.
[03:11:26.313 --> 03:11:33.015]  Also, we'll get into just a lot of other technological developments that have taken place and towards the end of the hour, we'll open the phones up.
[03:11:33.015 --> 03:11:44.257]  We're going to have some sections over the next 24 hours we've got left in the 27-hour transmission where we are going to just have nothing but phones that are open.
[03:11:44.257 --> 03:11:46.238]  But going to Katherine Albrecht.
[03:11:47.658 --> 03:11:52.364]  She's also fighting and praise God, hopefully winning a fight against breast cancer right now.
[03:11:52.364 --> 03:11:56.329]  So she might give us an update on that today as well.
[03:11:56.329 --> 03:11:57.871]  Katherine, good to have you here with us today.
[03:11:59.110 --> 03:12:01.772]  Well hey Alex, it's terrific to be on with you.
[03:12:01.772 --> 03:12:03.934]  I can't believe you're doing 27 hours.
[03:12:03.934 --> 03:12:05.435]  I think it's fantastic.
[03:12:05.435 --> 03:12:08.858]  You could probably do 100 hours and keep going.
[03:12:08.858 --> 03:12:14.183]  You're like the Energizer Bunny out there and I love it because there's just so much we've got to be covering.
[03:12:14.183 --> 03:12:23.151]  You know, I'm out here in New Hampshire where we got hit by this October, what they're calling a great Halloween power outage, this big storm we got.
[03:12:23.151 --> 03:12:25.433]  I'm on day six of no power.
[03:12:26.133 --> 03:12:29.756]  And the reason I bring that up, I'm actually broadcasting not out of my studio.
[03:12:29.756 --> 03:12:37.143]  I had to actually find somebody with power and get an opportunity to get online and connect to you this way.
[03:12:37.143 --> 03:12:41.547]  But there's a couple of things about this power outage I want to bring to people's attention.
[03:12:41.547 --> 03:12:50.195]  That when the powers that be choose to shut off our power, and I'm not implying that's what happened up here because we've got down trees across our power lines.
[03:12:50.635 --> 03:12:59.104]  But if someone at some point says, hey, you know what, we're going to turn off your internet, we're going to turn off your power, we are going to be helpless.
[03:12:59.104 --> 03:13:05.732]  It is amazing to me watching what happened when we had about two-thirds of the state of New Hampshire and virtually all of New England
[03:13:06.292 --> 03:13:07.653]  Without power.
[03:13:07.653 --> 03:13:10.095]  How everybody goes crazy.
[03:13:10.095 --> 03:13:11.776]  And you know, even those generators.
[03:13:11.776 --> 03:13:13.977]  People say, get prepared to get a generator.
[03:13:13.977 --> 03:13:17.940]  The lines at our gas stations are stretching a half a mile.
[03:13:17.940 --> 03:13:22.243]  People were saying it was taking 45 minutes to an hour just to get gasoline.
[03:13:22.243 --> 03:13:23.824]  Because everybody's got to refill.
[03:13:23.824 --> 03:13:27.146]  I mean, those generators are taking 10-15 gallons of gas a day.
[03:13:27.146 --> 03:13:29.587]  And if they shut that off, people are going to be in the dark.
[03:13:29.587 --> 03:13:30.428]  They're going to be cold.
[03:13:30.888 --> 03:13:34.950]  And let me tell you, more importantly, they're not going to have access to the Internet.
[03:13:34.950 --> 03:13:36.930]  And that's been the hardest part for me.
[03:13:36.930 --> 03:13:48.755]  I've got kerosene, I've got heat, I've got water, I've got all the stuff I need, but boy, I'll tell you, when you are out of communication range and you cannot use that Internet, it is mind-blowing what they can do.
[03:13:48.755 --> 03:13:50.776]  And then you take a look at the smart meters.
[03:13:50.776 --> 03:13:54.117]  You mentioned that at the opening of the show, which is such an important topic.
[03:13:54.597 --> 03:14:02.143]  Because the smart meters are about more than just making it easier for the power company to read your electric meter and send you a bill.
[03:14:02.143 --> 03:14:16.393]  The smart meters have an incredible amount of power to selectively shut off appliances in your home, to communicate with and have your appliances communicate back with the power company and say, hey, she ate three pieces of toast.
[03:14:16.793 --> 03:14:18.874]  Today, instead of one, what's going on?
[03:14:18.874 --> 03:14:20.754]  Does she have a visitor over?
[03:14:20.754 --> 03:14:23.255]  I mean, that level of invasiveness.
[03:14:23.255 --> 03:14:31.958]  And now we just had a new story come out telling us that the smart meter can even determine what show you're watching on TV or what DVD.
[03:14:31.958 --> 03:14:39.741]  But they actually monitor the amount of power that goes through your television to make light and dark images.
[03:14:39.741 --> 03:14:45.323]  And on the basis of that, they could run an algorithm and say exactly what TV show or movie you're watching.
[03:14:45.863 --> 03:14:47.925]  Unbelievable, and that's all coming.
[03:14:47.925 --> 03:14:52.608]  So, you know, when the power goes out, you start really thinking about that grid.
[03:14:52.608 --> 03:14:58.072]  Well, first they came out with smart meters five, six years ago and said, don't worry, we won't control your thermostat.
[03:14:58.072 --> 03:15:00.314]  Now they admit they're going to be doing it.
[03:15:00.314 --> 03:15:05.998]  And then they're also coming out with, as you know, data transmission down power lines.
[03:15:05.998 --> 03:15:13.844]  They're now building circuits in different appliances where that data transmission over power line couples in and spies on what you're doing.
[03:15:14.264 --> 03:15:17.145]  They're coming out and government buildings are testing it, of course.
[03:15:17.145 --> 03:15:21.647]  A flicker rate with fluorescent light bulbs that communicates with your computer.
[03:15:21.647 --> 03:15:23.508]  That's Associated Press.
[03:15:23.508 --> 03:15:26.209]  But let's get into the free speech issues first.
[03:15:26.209 --> 03:15:29.931]  Now we've seen David Cameron come out and say we're going to have to restrict free speech.
[03:15:29.931 --> 03:15:34.313]  We've seen the bill introduced, even CNET News, as you know, on Monday admitted.
[03:15:34.313 --> 03:15:40.056]  They have members of Congress saying this, this new piracy bill is the end of the Internet.
[03:15:40.056 --> 03:15:41.136]  No judge, no jury.
[03:15:41.136 --> 03:15:42.517]  They just shut down your website.
[03:15:43.584 --> 03:15:44.145]  I don't know.
[03:16:01.408 --> 03:16:04.229]  Under law, fair use, everything.
[03:16:04.229 --> 03:16:06.170]  It's commentary.
[03:16:06.170 --> 03:16:09.812]  Companies are registering even their commercials and things.
[03:16:09.812 --> 03:16:12.653]  And it automatically flags it and won't let us post it.
[03:16:12.653 --> 03:16:18.735]  I mean, that's the kind of smart systems they've got to surveil AI everything we're doing.
[03:16:18.735 --> 03:16:23.017]  An example is police are saying they're going to get the system that's being built into the new iPhones.
[03:16:25.538 --> 03:16:36.642]  They just broadcast a feed or a certain type of light to where they take control of your smartphones where you can't videotape them.
[03:16:36.642 --> 03:16:38.023]  That's what the globalists are doing.
[03:16:38.023 --> 03:16:48.206]  They're engineering into all the tech through global conventions the systems that surveil, control us, and then we pay for it when we purchase the product.
[03:16:48.206 --> 03:16:49.507]  I mean, it's so diabolical.
[03:16:50.632 --> 03:17:04.117]  Yeah, they built it in, and you know what I always clarify Alex, because as a privacy advocate, somebody who really works on those privacy issues, I always make it clear to people, listen, privacy is not an end, it's a means.
[03:17:04.117 --> 03:17:09.139]  You know, privacy, or taking your privacy away, is a means of achieving something else.
[03:17:09.839 --> 03:17:15.203]  And in the case of us, the citizens, what your privacy does is it gives you independence.
[03:17:15.203 --> 03:17:17.125]  It gives you anonymity.
[03:17:17.125 --> 03:17:19.346]  It gives you freedom of action.
[03:17:19.346 --> 03:17:20.847]  It gives you freedom.
[03:17:20.847 --> 03:17:24.290]  And so, you know, when people say, well, why do you really care who knows blah, blah, blah?
[03:17:24.290 --> 03:17:28.193]  I see that, you know, I personally care, but even if you don't care, that's not the point.
[03:17:28.733 --> 03:17:31.656]  Privacy is a form of power.
[03:17:31.656 --> 03:17:33.277]  It is a means to an end.
[03:17:33.277 --> 03:17:38.202]  And if someone takes away your privacy, the next thing they will take away is your freedom.
[03:17:38.202 --> 03:17:39.563]  And I'll give you an example.
[03:17:39.563 --> 03:17:43.207]  Why is it people are so up in arms about gun registration?
[03:17:43.687 --> 03:17:53.436]  The reason people get upset about gun registration is they know that once the government knows who has the guns, then when the time comes, they'll go knocking on those people's doors.
[03:17:53.436 --> 03:17:54.457]  Exactly, let me stop you.
[03:17:54.457 --> 03:17:58.901]  They'll come take them, and that's happened in every country where this has happened, from Nazi Germany to Australia.
[03:17:59.967 --> 03:18:01.368]  Exactly.
[03:18:01.368 --> 03:18:09.652]  Privacy is really your safety and governments that want your privacy are always building intelligence on you.
[03:18:09.652 --> 03:18:11.733]  It doesn't matter you did nothing wrong.
[03:18:11.733 --> 03:18:13.214]  Maybe they want your farm.
[03:18:13.214 --> 03:18:14.774]  Maybe they want your wife.
[03:18:14.774 --> 03:18:19.296]  Maybe they want to kill you and take your kids and press them into the Roman army.
[03:18:19.296 --> 03:18:24.119]  You know, the point is that it's not that we want our privacy because we're bad.
[03:18:24.119 --> 03:18:28.141]  It's because historically the bad guys want the intelligence on you.
[03:18:29.946 --> 03:18:41.683]  Well, that's beautifully said, and in the same way that you want to hang on to your privacy so you can hang on to your independence and your belongings and your freedoms, they want to take it away for the same reason.
[03:18:41.683 --> 03:18:45.088]  The reason people want to know everything you buy is not because they want to know everything you buy.
[03:18:45.489 --> 03:18:57.600]  I think it's because at some point in the future, they're going to want to be able to do exactly what Hitler did during World War II or leading up to it, which is to say certain people just don't qualify to buy food.
[03:18:57.600 --> 03:19:02.485]  You know, they said the Jews are not allowed to buy bread and milk and eggs.
[03:19:02.485 --> 03:19:07.430]  Yeah, you can go buy other stuff, but you know, the basic food stuff, if you're Jewish, you couldn't buy that.
[03:19:07.930 --> 03:19:09.211]  Agency controls.
[03:19:09.211 --> 03:19:11.933]  It's always an internal control system.
[03:19:11.933 --> 03:19:15.435]  Now the TSA is asking about a few silver coins.
[03:19:15.435 --> 03:19:21.820]  But if you expand into that, now they've passed a law where secondhand shops can't take cash in Louisiana.
[03:19:21.820 --> 03:19:26.123]  It's about tracking everything and taxing it to destroy.
[03:19:26.123 --> 03:19:33.528]  See, the colonies were being destroyed by the taxes because in England, the manufacturers wanted them shut down.
[03:19:33.528 --> 03:19:35.950]  The power to tax is the power to destroy.
[03:19:35.950 --> 03:19:36.410]  People say, well,
[03:19:36.710 --> 03:19:39.071]  Who cares if the government knows everything I'm doing?
[03:19:39.071 --> 03:19:41.633]  The point is they want to destroy you.
[03:19:41.633 --> 03:19:43.533]  They want to shut you down.
[03:19:43.533 --> 03:19:44.994]  This is scorched earth.
[03:19:44.994 --> 03:19:45.715]  Catherine, stay there.
[03:19:45.715 --> 03:19:46.315]  Incredible.
[03:19:46.315 --> 03:19:52.098]  I want you to continue along that point about why this is so important, dealing with the currency controls.
[03:19:52.098 --> 03:19:53.859]  I'm calling it currency controls.
[03:19:53.859 --> 03:20:01.002]  What's the term called where they start tracking all the money and transactions in a country always during inflationary periods?
[03:20:01.002 --> 03:20:02.263]  It'll pop in my head in a moment.
[03:20:02.683 --> 03:20:04.204]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[03:20:04.204 --> 03:20:10.488]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[03:20:10.488 --> 03:20:14.671]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[03:20:14.671 --> 03:20:16.612]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[03:20:16.612 --> 03:20:19.033]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[03:20:19.033 --> 03:20:26.578]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.

[03:23:00.157 --> 03:23:02.739]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:23:02.739 --> 03:23:08.584]  This holiday season, more than half of our nation is in need of help due to the shattered economy.
[03:23:08.584 --> 03:23:12.307]  So now is the time to express the holiday spirit more than ever.
[03:23:12.307 --> 03:23:17.591]  Consider helping those you love with the most important gift, a supply of delicious, easy to fix,
[03:23:18.011 --> 03:23:18.632]  We're good to go.
[03:23:43.914 --> 03:23:47.517]  At efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex to find the special.

[03:24:35.012 --> 03:24:35.072]  800-259-9231.
[03:24:35.072 --> 03:24:37.013]  Then, when we start the next hour, it's going to be open phones.
[03:24:37.013 --> 03:24:39.195]  We'll go to our phone system here in-house.
[03:24:39.195 --> 03:24:40.636]  It's just going to be commercial-free.
[03:24:52.310 --> 03:24:57.593]  And for breaks, I'll play little special reports by Darren McBreen.
[03:24:57.593 --> 03:25:00.956]  We've got some other things lined up so I can take breaks from time to time.
[03:25:00.956 --> 03:25:13.784]  And we do have David Icke, George Norrie coming up, Mike Adams, Tex Mars, and so many others, Gerald Cilente, you name it, Fritz Springmeier, Jim Mars, Chapman, Alan Watt.
[03:25:14.969 --> 03:25:16.270]  The list goes on and on.
[03:25:16.270 --> 03:25:22.475]  And we're going to premiere some videos, special interviews here as well coming up.
[03:25:22.475 --> 03:25:25.858]  It is the 2011 Money Bomb.
[03:25:25.858 --> 03:25:27.459]  I think I should have brought up to Tarpley.
[03:25:27.459 --> 03:25:28.060]  He's been down here.
[03:25:28.060 --> 03:25:28.901]  He's seen it.
[03:25:28.901 --> 03:25:34.765]  Our full studios and what we've built in the last four years with your support with the last three Money Bombs.
[03:25:34.765 --> 03:25:36.347]  And we've got a lot of donations coming in.
[03:25:36.347 --> 03:25:37.668]  People are calling to donate at 888.
[03:25:39.389 --> 03:25:39.850]  253-3139.
[03:25:39.850 --> 03:25:46.074]  I'd like to thank you for your donation and your continued support of InfoWars and what we're doing here.
[03:25:46.074 --> 03:25:46.995]  We're all in this together.
[03:25:46.995 --> 03:25:48.556]  888-253-3139.
[03:25:48.556 --> 03:25:55.842]  And, of course, you can also go donate at InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com or just InfoWars.com.
[03:25:55.842 --> 03:25:57.163]  You can find it right there.
[03:25:57.163 --> 03:26:02.907]  And you can also spread the link to the 27-hour broadcast of the video feed.
[03:26:02.907 --> 03:26:04.408]  That's up at InfoWars.com.
[03:26:04.408 --> 03:26:06.770]  So please help spread the word about that as well.
[03:26:06.770 --> 03:26:07.270]  Now, Catherine,
[03:26:08.391 --> 03:26:09.412]  You just went to the heart of this.
[03:26:09.412 --> 03:26:12.233]  They're setting up capital controls inside the country.
[03:26:12.233 --> 03:26:15.474]  They're making it hard to get your money outside the country.
[03:26:15.474 --> 03:26:17.415]  They're tracking everything we do.
[03:26:17.415 --> 03:26:19.076]  There's a reason we had privacy.
[03:26:19.076 --> 03:26:21.617]  There's a reason we had a Fourth Amendment.
[03:26:21.617 --> 03:26:23.678]  And now it's basically completely gone.
[03:26:23.678 --> 03:26:27.460]  I mean the stuff that we were worried about 10 years ago, it's already surpassed that.
[03:26:27.460 --> 03:26:28.781]  And you were bringing up this fact that
[03:26:30.256 --> 03:26:32.579]  Again, it's not us that has something to hide.
[03:26:32.579 --> 03:26:34.602]  Look at how secretive government is.
[03:26:34.602 --> 03:26:41.592]  As it more and more wants to know everything we're doing, and it's caught framing us as well, that's another issue of privacy.
[03:26:41.592 --> 03:26:46.218]  Now, now, they want to be completely secret.
[03:26:46.218 --> 03:26:46.819]  Please continue.
[03:26:47.935 --> 03:26:50.757]  Yeah, well, that's for darn sure, isn't it?
[03:26:50.757 --> 03:27:00.343]  And, you know, this E-Parasites Act that you were talking about, this act that basically says you can shut down a website if there's something on it that somebody says is copyrighted.
[03:27:00.343 --> 03:27:10.289]  You know, I was thinking you can go on my website, katherinealbrecht.com or spychips.com or even nocards.org, my ancient website where we were fighting shopper cards.
[03:27:10.289 --> 03:27:16.673]  And on those websites, it occurred to me, under this new E-Parasites bill, if it passes, you can have a picture of me
[03:27:17.473 --> 03:27:23.899]  In a protest, right, with a big stop RFID sign standing under a Walmart sign in the snow.
[03:27:23.899 --> 03:27:25.440]  I did that in Amherst, New Hampshire.
[03:27:25.440 --> 03:27:27.021]  I've done that in Texas, in Dallas.
[03:27:27.021 --> 03:27:28.403]  I've done it all over the country.
[03:27:28.403 --> 03:27:42.695]  But you could take that picture and make the argument that because I've got Walmart's logo up there in the photo, even though I took a picture on a street corner with you standing under their sign, that I'm violating their copyright.
[03:27:43.075 --> 03:27:51.858]  Now, where this gets interesting is because, of course, the bill says, if you violate copyright, then we can basically shut your website down.
[03:27:51.858 --> 03:27:53.538]  Now, there's a couple catches here, though.
[03:27:53.538 --> 03:27:56.559]  You can't shut down a website that's based in another country.
[03:27:56.559 --> 03:28:09.843]  So the first thing I would do, or if they did that to InfoWars.com, first thing I would do, of course, is I would say, well, let me get an offshore ISP, or an offshore hosting service, and- The problem is they're doing it- Over there.
[03:28:10.063 --> 03:28:11.485]  So they're doing a global treaty, though.
[03:28:11.485 --> 03:28:13.147]  The Russians and the Chinese do this everywhere.
[03:28:13.147 --> 03:28:19.917]  And again, just like Righthaven, the copyright troll, just had their assets seized by federal marshals.
[03:28:19.917 --> 03:28:25.585]  They claim similar things and were defeated roundly in every court case that we've seen so far that went to court.
[03:28:26.326 --> 03:28:27.748]  But it's a fraud.
[03:28:27.748 --> 03:28:28.489]  It's made up.
[03:28:28.489 --> 03:28:37.281]  The lawyers are attempting to tell people, you've got to have permission to shoot video of a street corner if there's a McDonald's sign.
[03:28:37.281 --> 03:28:41.767]  No, as long as you're under news and information and free speech, you're covered.
[03:28:42.808 --> 03:28:48.110]  So it's a fraud, but they tell you you can't show an image of Walmart that you took.
[03:28:48.110 --> 03:28:49.770]  That's our copyright.
[03:28:49.770 --> 03:28:51.731]  And then there's no judge, no jury, no nothing.
[03:28:51.731 --> 03:28:54.192]  They just take your website down.
[03:28:54.192 --> 03:28:58.833]  It's the incredible arbitrary fraud of this, and it's all just a power grab.
[03:28:58.833 --> 03:29:00.234]  It's like when McDonald's tried to take
[03:29:00.774 --> 03:29:09.503]  The name from the McDonald family and said, you can't use this on your castle in Scotland, you know, that pays for itself by having a bed and breakfast in it.
[03:29:09.503 --> 03:29:11.485]  You can't call it McDonald Castle.
[03:29:11.485 --> 03:29:14.668]  And they said, well, this name is 1600 years old.
[03:29:14.668 --> 03:29:15.349]  And they sued him.
[03:29:15.349 --> 03:29:17.371]  The McDonald's had to fight him and win.
[03:29:17.371 --> 03:29:19.373]  But it's this attempt to bring in this tyranny.
[03:29:20.535 --> 03:29:22.356]  Yeah, that they own everything.
[03:29:22.356 --> 03:29:36.280]  And, of course, the Internet, and I'm discovering this after six days of being out of power and off the Internet, the Internet, I don't think we recognize how much we've come to rely on it and how much we've almost eliminated other means of communication.
[03:29:36.280 --> 03:29:43.103]  And that's when I get a little bit nervous, when I start saying, OK, so we've got this system that works really well for us advocates to find each other.
[03:29:43.103 --> 03:29:46.524]  But if they take it away, we don't have backup systems.
[03:29:46.524 --> 03:29:46.924]  Stay there.
[03:29:46.924 --> 03:29:47.844]  Let's talk about that.
[03:29:47.844 --> 03:29:49.645]  Long segment coming up with Dr. Katherine Altman.
[03:29:51.141 --> 03:29:55.053]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.053 --> 03:29:57.722]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:02.082 --> 03:30:07.286]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[03:31:01.875 --> 03:31:03.296]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:31:03.296 --> 03:31:13.960]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[03:31:13.960 --> 03:31:21.183]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without your help.
[03:31:21.183 --> 03:31:27.125]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your
[03:31:27.345 --> 03:31:27.746]  I'm good.
[03:31:42.142 --> 03:31:51.968]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[03:31:51.968 --> 03:31:53.468]  The war is here.
[03:31:53.468 --> 03:31:55.370]  It's an info war.
[03:31:55.370 --> 03:31:57.911]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[03:32:01.673 --> 03:32:07.094]  If the government is busy secretly stockpiling emergency food supplies, shouldn't you be too?
[03:32:07.094 --> 03:32:15.776]  In any emergency food situation, when the local grocery stores and your kitchen cabinets are empty, the first 72 hours are critical to you and your family.
[03:32:15.776 --> 03:32:22.178]  With the 72-hour emergency meal kit from Solutions from Science, you will be prepared for the troubled times ahead.
[03:32:22.178 --> 03:32:31.020]  These flavorful and filling 12 prepackaged meals come in a variety of dishes, have a 25-year shelf life, and simply require water to make them ready to eat.
[03:32:31.320 --> 03:32:35.543]  Are the cans of soup and extra jar of peanut butter going to see you through?
[03:32:35.543 --> 03:32:40.286]  The 72 Hour Emergency Meal Kit is now on sale for $39.97.
[03:32:40.286 --> 03:32:43.228]  A small investment for tremendous peace of mind.

[03:32:48.752 --> 03:32:49.792]  That's 72Survival.com.
[03:32:49.792 --> 03:32:50.293]  Or call 800-208-9491.
[03:32:50.293 --> 03:32:50.573]  That's 800-208-9491.
[03:32:50.573 --> 03:32:52.854]  Why face the next emergency on an empty stomach?
[03:33:14.811 --> 03:33:20.736]  My friends, it is so incredible to see what's happening in our society.
[03:33:20.736 --> 03:33:27.501]  To witness world government being announced, global currencies being pushed as a solution to all the world's problems.
[03:33:27.501 --> 03:33:30.524]  Imminent attack on Iran, unless we get the word out and stop this.
[03:33:31.741 --> 03:33:34.142]  Total surveillance.
[03:33:34.142 --> 03:33:38.403]  Lamp posts going up all over the country with microphones and cameras in them.
[03:33:38.403 --> 03:33:41.904]  This was already happening 13 years ago.
[03:33:41.904 --> 03:33:44.565]  It's in my film Police State 2000 I put out in 99.
[03:33:44.565 --> 03:33:47.206]  I have the documents from 1998.
[03:33:47.206 --> 03:33:53.588]  This is a criminal group that has set up a fraud.
[03:33:53.588 --> 03:33:59.890]  The public is living in a false reality and they are setting up a giant DARPA controlled grid
[03:34:01.628 --> 03:34:09.754]  Known as the internet that is meant to absorb society, make it cashless, track everything, and then add fines and fees.
[03:34:09.754 --> 03:34:12.016]  That's another problem with cashless society.
[03:34:12.016 --> 03:34:14.218]  Oh, we'll put a $5 fee on all your transactions.
[03:34:15.222 --> 03:34:17.143]  Now you pay to keep your money with us.
[03:34:17.143 --> 03:34:20.426]  Now companies make you get automatic transfer.
[03:34:20.426 --> 03:34:23.788]  Now you can't use that cash in that second-hand transaction.
[03:34:23.788 --> 03:34:29.572]  Now Homeland Security came out yesterday and said paying with cash is suspicious.
[03:34:29.572 --> 03:34:31.414]  And they told hotels, spy on people.
[03:34:32.506 --> 03:34:36.348]  Dig through your luggage, but nobody digs through the Fed's luggage.
[03:34:36.348 --> 03:34:38.169]  All caught bringing in narcotics.
[03:34:38.169 --> 03:34:44.593]  Catherine, you were getting in, and we're going to go to some calls here, but I want to kind of shut up for 10 minutes or so and give you the floor here.
[03:34:44.593 --> 03:34:54.999]  I want you to run through for people, because you were getting into the fact that it's being set up to where we can't operate without it, and old communication systems are going away.
[03:34:54.999 --> 03:34:58.121]  Like, a lot of people want to continue to have Pirate FM, Micro-FM.
[03:34:58.121 --> 03:35:01.243]  I think it's a great idea, as long as it doesn't interfere with the commercial spectrum.
[03:35:02.321 --> 03:35:08.085]  Now they're handing FM translators to all the big companies to put on mindless stuff like comedy or whatever.
[03:35:08.085 --> 03:35:09.706]  No local programming.
[03:35:09.706 --> 03:35:11.027]  No local interest.
[03:35:11.027 --> 03:35:13.249]  Nothing that serves the community.
[03:35:13.249 --> 03:35:15.971]  And now the FCC's been talking about making it to where...
[03:35:17.563 --> 03:35:25.952]  You can't pick up a reception in your new digital radio with all the cars coming out unless it's got a code authorizing it.
[03:35:25.952 --> 03:35:33.901]  So even if you put up, like they used against the Soviets, a pirate FM and say Romania, it won't even be picked up by the phone.
[03:35:33.901 --> 03:35:35.923]  Just like they can blacklist InfoWars.com.
[03:35:36.784 --> 03:35:37.845]  Or alternative media.
[03:35:37.845 --> 03:35:43.028]  People need to realize we're entering a time where you're not just going to be able to tune in to all this.
[03:35:43.028 --> 03:35:44.809]  People need to appreciate it.
[03:35:44.809 --> 03:35:46.750]  They need to understand how important it is.
[03:35:46.750 --> 03:35:57.156]  They need to tell everybody now about InfoWars.com, about the 27-hour transmission and the free video streams that are up there right now to create a viral spread of this information.
[03:35:57.156 --> 03:35:59.738]  They need to donate at InfoWarsMoneyBomb so we can
[03:36:00.658 --> 03:36:16.166]  I tell people sign up at the Infowars Insider because we've been told by our experts that email is something that even if they shut us all down with that list, I can still write articles or with compression do short audios or videos and encode that and send that out to people.
[03:36:16.166 --> 03:36:18.727]  So we need people to sign up there for that free newsletter.
[03:36:18.727 --> 03:36:25.530]  I mean, we really are mounting an assault against the globalists who've created this artificial habitat for us that they're now phasing us into.
[03:36:25.530 --> 03:36:26.991]  So Catherine, you've got the floor.
[03:36:27.887 --> 03:36:38.063]  I want you to break down what you were getting into, the threats you see, other facets, other areas, the whole Futurist system, what's driving this, what the master plan is, then we'll go to calls.
[03:36:39.039 --> 03:36:41.860]  Well, and that's what I want to get into is some of the solutions.
[03:36:41.860 --> 03:36:46.521]  You're talking about, you know, sending out encrypted email, getting people onto InfoWars.
[03:36:46.521 --> 03:36:49.462]  These are all things that people should be doing.
[03:36:49.462 --> 03:36:52.863]  And, you know, I'll send anybody who'll ask me, hey, where do I get the information?
[03:36:52.863 --> 03:36:54.824]  I'll say, you know, InfoWars.com.
[03:36:54.824 --> 03:36:56.124]  I've got my websites up.
[03:36:56.124 --> 03:36:59.025]  You know, there's a lot of places out there where people can go.
[03:36:59.025 --> 03:37:02.886]  You do an extraordinary job of being a clearinghouse for a lot of that.
[03:37:03.386 --> 03:37:21.596]  But let me also tell you, in terms of encryption, and when we start talking solutions, what drives me crazy is when people on our team, people who ought to know better, are sending those emails through Gmail, for example, or signing up for Google Voicemail, for example, because Google is reading all those emails.
[03:37:22.157 --> 03:37:36.470]  And if they're using Google as their search engine, and I've told your listeners many times before, Startpage.com is the company that I recommend as an alternative to Google, because Google is reading all of the searches that you do.
[03:37:36.470 --> 03:37:44.999]  So if you go in there and you search for global control grid, or you search for offshore tax havens, or you search for smart meter opposition,
[03:37:45.459 --> 03:37:53.424]  Whatever it is you're putting in there, the fact that you typed it in, Google is using and they are creating these incredibly detailed profiles.
[03:37:53.424 --> 03:37:59.127]  We know that one of the founders of Google said he wants the company to become like the mind of God.
[03:37:59.127 --> 03:38:01.809]  If you look at that, you say, okay.
[03:38:01.809 --> 03:38:03.690]  So they're scanning in all the world's books.
[03:38:04.250 --> 03:38:15.298]  They have become the primary means of communication in this country today, believe it or not, because that's where you go if you want to figure out, you know, ask your question.
[03:38:15.298 --> 03:38:22.422]  Hey, give me a recipe for cinnamon toast or tell me what's the latest on the power outage or whatever it might be.
[03:38:22.422 --> 03:38:24.784]  People log on to Google unthinkingly.
[03:38:24.784 --> 03:38:27.986]  So there are some tools out there that people can use.
[03:38:27.986 --> 03:38:30.428]  One of them is SSL encryption.
[03:38:30.708 --> 03:38:36.931]  The reason this is important and I'm going to take a minute and I usually don't like to get too technical on people so I'll explain this.
[03:38:36.931 --> 03:38:49.657]  SSL stands for Secure Socket Layer Encryption and what it does is it takes your communication through the internet which normally goes out wide open it's like a postcard versus
[03:38:50.237 --> 03:38:54.599]  A sealed envelope with a bunch of layers of duct tape on it.
[03:38:54.599 --> 03:38:55.539]  That's the difference.
[03:38:55.539 --> 03:39:03.382]  When you send an email or you log on to a website, you are essentially sending a postcard to your internet service provider.
[03:39:03.382 --> 03:39:09.645]  That's your charter, your AT&T, your Verizon, whoever's giving you your net connection is monitoring where you go.
[03:39:09.645 --> 03:39:11.746]  They're monitoring what you send.
[03:39:11.746 --> 03:39:14.287]  They have the capability of reading your email.
[03:39:14.947 --> 03:39:27.499]  If you are sending from or to a Gmail account, a Yahoo account, or a Hotmail account, and many of these other free email services, not only that, but you're sending a postcard that they are reading and recording.
[03:39:27.499 --> 03:39:39.131]  So they take all the words out of your email, they put that into your giant profile, and the only way you can protect yourself against that level of observation is through SSL encryption.
[03:39:39.611 --> 03:39:44.695]  Now people may remember a couple years ago there was something called Pretty Good Privacy or PGP.
[03:39:44.695 --> 03:39:47.396]  Really hard to implement, not very popular.
[03:39:47.396 --> 03:39:52.440]  I tried to use it myself and I'm a privacy person even I said oh this is a pain.
[03:39:52.440 --> 03:40:03.167]  So the whole PGP privacy thing, Startpage is working on an email program that will be totally private, totally encrypted and will incorporate PGP.
[03:40:03.167 --> 03:40:05.188]  It's going to be called Startmail.
[03:40:05.188 --> 03:40:06.709]  It's coming out probably the end of 2012.
[03:40:07.930 --> 03:40:18.375]  But in the meantime, Startpage, and if people don't know what that is, Alex, you know, it's the private search engine that people need to be using instead of Google, because they don't record all of the stuff you do.
[03:40:18.375 --> 03:40:30.180]  They don't record your IP address, they don't record your searches, they don't know your identity, they don't use tracking cookies, and I can vouch for them because I'm actually now a VP with the company after having him as a guest on the show a couple years back.
[03:40:30.180 --> 03:40:31.201]  So, Startpage
[03:40:31.921 --> 03:40:38.626]  Just made an announcement this week that they have switched over to complete SSL encryption.
[03:40:38.626 --> 03:40:50.154]  And now what that means is that when you log on to start page and you make a search, so let's say you look up offshore tax havens, or you look up InfoWars, or you know the latest story that we've got out there.
[03:40:50.154 --> 03:40:51.395]  I don't know maybe those
[03:40:51.995 --> 03:40:53.877]  Electric lights.
[03:40:53.877 --> 03:40:56.138]  The street lights that can listen to you.
[03:40:56.138 --> 03:40:58.900]  So when you search for that in Google, they know it.
[03:40:58.900 --> 03:41:01.782]  Or you look for Juan Paul, they know who all the supporters are.
[03:41:01.782 --> 03:41:15.012]  But if you go to Startpage and you search for that, what is new is now not only does Startpage not record you, it's Startpage.com, but your ISP can't see what you're doing with Startpage.
[03:41:15.012 --> 03:41:18.275]  So your ISP no longer can record your searches.
[03:41:18.936 --> 03:41:22.725]  Now, the thing that has people a little confused, though, is if you click on a link.
[03:41:22.725 --> 03:41:23.687]  So let's say you go on.
[03:41:23.687 --> 03:41:24.870]  It's just like Google, by the way.
[03:41:26.185 --> 03:41:31.530]  And in fact, Start Page Now returns 100% Google results totally privately.
[03:41:31.530 --> 03:41:38.136]  So we go to Google, we grab Google's results, we strip everything away from them, and then we re-serve them to you.
[03:41:38.136 --> 03:41:42.440]  So when you go there, if you click on a link, now you're leaving the SSL encryption.
[03:41:42.440 --> 03:41:44.722]  You lose that encrypted protection.
[03:41:44.722 --> 03:41:50.468]  Unless you do one thing, and we're the only search engine that offers this, click the word proxy.
[03:41:50.988 --> 03:41:56.616]  There's actually a little link under your search results for the outside third-party website.
[03:41:56.616 --> 03:41:59.459]  It'll save you through XQuick Proxy.
[03:41:59.459 --> 03:42:03.344]  Now if you click that, so let's say you want to go to a government website.
[03:42:03.344 --> 03:42:06.549]  You know, I tried to go to just the National Weather Service website.
[03:42:07.089 --> 03:42:11.690]  And I have a whole bunch of things on my computer that alert me when they're doing stuff.
[03:42:11.690 --> 03:42:18.532]  And I had something saying, they're running a script on this page, they're loading cookies into my browser.
[03:42:18.532 --> 03:42:19.992]  I was like, get me out of here!
[03:42:19.992 --> 03:42:22.593]  So I went to startpage.com.
[03:42:22.593 --> 03:42:24.253]  I punched in National Weather Service.
[03:42:24.253 --> 03:42:25.233]  And you were able to get there?
[03:42:25.233 --> 03:42:27.454]  Go ahead and finish up.
[03:42:29.215 --> 03:42:36.576]  Well, what they do is Startpage gets the National Weather Service, loads it for me, and the National Weather Service never sees me.
[03:42:36.576 --> 03:42:46.798]  Can't put a cookie on my browser, can't run a script, doesn't even know that I was there, and my ISP doesn't know I went to the National Weather Service because everything is now encrypted.
[03:42:46.798 --> 03:42:52.339]  So, it's pretty much the most private way you can surf the internet, and I would say it's great.
[03:42:52.339 --> 03:42:53.499]  It certainly is.
[03:42:53.499 --> 03:42:57.620]  Now, going back here, though, we all know that authoritarian regimes
[03:42:58.832 --> 03:43:00.775]  Go through your mail.
[03:43:00.775 --> 03:43:05.882]  And people would get mad if the post office was going through their mail, which they now do.
[03:43:05.882 --> 03:43:13.033]  But if it's digital mail, oh, we're just going to have an AI computer read that, scan that, put it in your algorithm.
[03:43:13.033 --> 03:43:14.655]  And these companies are all on record.
[03:43:15.759 --> 03:43:23.545]  You're doing this and then you learn they have a partnership with the government because you, when you sign up the terms, don't understand you're waiving your rights.
[03:43:23.545 --> 03:43:25.647]  Now that's given to the government.
[03:43:25.647 --> 03:43:32.132]  And now we see the big mega corporations basically trying to get government to just fully sign government power over to them.
[03:43:32.132 --> 03:43:34.113]  It is completely predatory.
[03:43:34.113 --> 03:43:38.537]  I want to go to some phone calls, but Catherine, I know you've been tracking this.
[03:43:38.537 --> 03:43:43.601]  Is it even kind of still amazing you to actually see it happening where there's all these calls now?
[03:43:44.983 --> 03:43:47.445]  To start censoring the alternative media?
[03:43:47.445 --> 03:44:08.886]  I mean, I see that as a real coming of age for the alternative media, becoming the true dominant media, but it's also scary the perfect storm of government, major corporations and media that are all on the hot seat, getting together now, spinning the end of the internet as we know it, as members of Congress that have read this bill have said.
[03:44:10.418 --> 03:44:22.550]  The Internet is the biggest threat that they have ever faced, because for the first time in all of history, in the history of humanity, millions of people can communicate with one another instantaneously.
[03:44:22.550 --> 03:44:24.112]  And the government hates that.
[03:44:24.112 --> 03:44:30.499]  Now, they're more than happy if you want to communicate and say, oh, how much you really love their, you know, President Obama's latest bill.
[03:44:30.999 --> 03:44:37.642]  But if you're going to get on there and talk about how much you know what's really going on, then they ought to put an end to that.
[03:44:37.642 --> 03:44:47.526]  So they are coming up with, you know, whether it's terrorism or shutting down on financial crimes, they're going to come up with a reason, they're going to have an excuse, and they're going to find ways, first of all, to monitor.
[03:44:47.526 --> 03:44:49.807]  This is what I was saying at the beginning of the show.
[03:44:49.807 --> 03:44:50.668]  You monitor first.
[03:44:51.568 --> 03:44:53.349]  And then you start clamping down.
[03:44:53.349 --> 03:44:55.790]  And that is why, again, I'm just going to repeat it.
[03:44:55.790 --> 03:45:00.413]  People need to find ways to use the Internet and get out of the monitoring.
[03:45:00.413 --> 03:45:04.735]  Anybody writing... I'm to the point where I almost won't even answer a Gmail.
[03:45:04.735 --> 03:45:13.460]  If you write to me from a Gmail account, I don't want to write you back because I know that everything I say to you, I may as well be saying into a megaphone to Google.
[03:45:14.901 --> 03:45:16.462]  Let me expand on that.
[03:45:16.462 --> 03:45:23.984]  We have people that sign up for our emails, but if they're with Gmail or others, Gmail will complain and call our mail spam.
[03:45:23.984 --> 03:45:27.125]  So, I mean, they're just total Nazis.
[03:45:27.125 --> 03:45:28.266]  They're out of control.
[03:45:28.266 --> 03:45:36.449]  And I agree we should try to do alternative systems and develop those systems outside of Big Brother's purview, but we should politically and legally
[03:45:36.809 --> 03:45:41.194]  Try to challenge the entire unconstitutional action on its face as well.
[03:45:41.194 --> 03:45:45.799]  Catherine, I want to get an update on your health, because everybody's obviously praying for you and concerned about you here in a moment.
[03:45:45.799 --> 03:45:52.367]  But let's start getting the calls now, because I think we've got to leave at the end of the hour, because we're going to leave the Genesis Network at that point, and that's how you're connected to us.
[03:45:52.927 --> 03:46:00.113]  And then we are going to transfer over to the rest of the 27-hour plus live transmission with George Norrie, David Icke, and many others coming up today.
[03:46:00.113 --> 03:46:03.115]  If you want to donate, it's infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[03:46:03.115 --> 03:46:07.058]  You can also call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[03:46:07.058 --> 03:46:15.365]  And we have deals going where you can get, what is this, all 14 of my films that are on DVD for
[03:46:18.002 --> 03:46:20.043]  $99.95 instead of $349.
[03:46:20.043 --> 03:46:22.605]  That's the Alex Jones Everything Special.
[03:46:22.605 --> 03:46:24.006]  We never offered it at that price.
[03:46:24.006 --> 03:46:29.750]  It's a Money Bomb Special, so you get great tools to wake yourself up more and those around you and support us.
[03:46:29.750 --> 03:46:36.416]  Also, you got the Alex Jones Classic DVD Special, and that is five films for $29.95.
[03:46:36.416 --> 03:46:41.479]  It's actually six films because one of them has two films on it.
[03:46:41.479 --> 03:46:45.602]  Then we've got also the Patriot Flags.
[03:46:46.663 --> 03:46:49.744]  We've got all of those to help spread the word with your neighbors and others.
[03:46:49.744 --> 03:46:56.587]  We have the essential Alex Jones, my five best-selling films for $24.95, all available at Infowars.com.
[03:46:56.587 --> 03:47:04.910]  We've now cut the bumper stickers down to absolute cost, normally $25 for the variety pack, now $5.95.
[03:47:04.910 --> 03:47:07.411]  Certainly get the word out against the globalists with that.
[03:47:07.411 --> 03:47:09.112]  We are pulling out all the stops.
[03:47:09.112 --> 03:47:14.253]  For $19.95, you can get my four films on 9-11, the 9-11 documentary special.
[03:47:14.253 --> 03:47:15.434]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[03:47:15.874 --> 03:47:17.078]  We'll take a lot more as the 27 hours...
[03:47:18.806 --> 03:47:28.393]  continues a lot of folks would just Let the guests talk and as I've been doing a little bit today and not and mainly take calls But we've got so much info.
[03:47:28.393 --> 03:47:43.323]  I tend to not be like most talk show hosts that just rely on calls It probably would be better though to take more calls because I always hear the calls and rebroadcast and wish I took more So we'll do that for the rest of this hour and the entire next hour and then more coming up We've also got some other surprises coming up.
[03:47:43.323 --> 03:47:44.524]  So stay with us.
[03:47:44.524 --> 03:47:45.044]  Let's talk to
[03:47:46.585 --> 03:47:49.186]  Mike in Wisconsin, you're on the air with Dr. Kathryn Albrecht.
[03:47:49.186 --> 03:47:49.566]  Go ahead.
[03:47:49.566 --> 03:47:53.148]  Oh, Kathryn, it's a pleasure.
[03:47:53.148 --> 03:47:54.068]  Alex, you're the man.
[03:47:54.068 --> 03:47:55.729]  What's up?
[03:47:55.729 --> 03:47:56.830]  I'm doing well, sir.
[03:47:56.830 --> 03:47:57.770]  Thank you for joining us.
[03:47:57.770 --> 03:48:02.372]  Are you watching us on the free video streams at InfoWars.com or are you listening?
[03:48:02.372 --> 03:48:04.173]  Yes, I am.
[03:48:04.173 --> 03:48:15.278]  I'm watching online right now and also I'm glad you guys are talking about online communication because I'm in my mid-20s and I've learned
[03:48:15.987 --> 03:48:18.617]  There's lots of other ways to communicate online.
[03:48:18.617 --> 03:48:21.889]  I don't know if Catherine's ever heard of Internet Relay Chat?
[03:48:23.192 --> 03:48:25.012]  Oh yeah, you know, it's funny.
[03:48:25.012 --> 03:48:28.873]  IRC was my big addiction back in graduate school.
[03:48:28.873 --> 03:48:30.494]  So yeah, I'm a huge fan of IRC.
[03:48:30.494 --> 03:48:32.374]  Internet relay chat, absolutely.
[03:48:32.374 --> 03:48:34.194]  Are you talking about like VVS systems?
[03:48:34.194 --> 03:48:37.355]  And then you've got all the... Exactly.
[03:48:37.355 --> 03:48:42.196]  And the nice thing about it, you can actually set them up from computer to computer.
[03:48:42.196 --> 03:48:51.578]  So if you've got the skills or have a friend with the skills, you can actually set up an encrypted stream just between you and a single other person.
[03:48:51.979 --> 03:48:53.642]  I mean, there's a lot of ways you can use it.
[03:48:53.642 --> 03:48:55.506]  So yeah, I'm a big fan of IRC.
[03:48:55.506 --> 03:49:02.219]  It's kind of fallen out of favor with Facebook and everything else, but yeah, I'd say that would be a great thing for people to revive.
[03:49:04.016 --> 03:49:13.684]  I'm glad that you're aware of it, because, you know, there are a lot of us out there that still know how to use programs like that, and, you know, we'll try to keep it alive and keep the word out for things like that.
[03:49:13.684 --> 03:49:31.618]  But real quick, Alex... Yeah, and, you know, keep developing the new systems, because what we need to be doing, and this is what I love about Startpage, you know, when they passed this thing that said, hey, we want to start... All of the ISPs have to log all the traffic that people do, all the websites you go to.
[03:49:31.618 --> 03:49:33.019]  We were like, whoa, time out.
[03:49:33.519 --> 03:49:42.003]  How can we technologically, in this era where we got so many skills, you know, we got great technology on our team, on the Freedom Team.
[03:49:42.003 --> 03:49:47.045]  And so, the team there at Startpage, we got together and said, alright, so how do we get around it?
[03:49:47.045 --> 03:49:48.886]  And so that's how we came up with the proxy.
[03:49:48.886 --> 03:49:51.687]  We said, yeah, log away ISPs, be my guest.
[03:49:51.687 --> 03:49:55.869]  You record every place I go, because you won't be able to see a darn thing.
[03:49:55.869 --> 03:49:59.391]  I can go to a hundred websites in a day, and you won't know.
[03:49:59.391 --> 03:50:02.112]  Well, here's a San Francisco Chronicle article today.
[03:50:02.532 --> 03:50:05.434]  Smart meters send almost 10,000 signals a day.
[03:50:05.434 --> 03:50:12.479]  I mean, yeah, instead of a guy coming by once a week to find out what you used, oh, we're Greeks bearing gifts, Troy.
[03:50:12.479 --> 03:50:21.045]  Take our Trojan horse, and then it's tagged onto your bill to pay for something, spying on what you watch on TV, and you tell somebody this.
[03:50:21.045 --> 03:50:23.387]  I tell people this stuff 10 years ago, they laugh at me.
[03:50:23.387 --> 03:50:24.527]  Now it's in their face.
[03:50:24.527 --> 03:50:27.269]  I mean, this is such an out-of-control system.
[03:50:27.269 --> 03:50:28.010]  Sir, you had a question?
[03:50:30.040 --> 03:50:35.845]  I actually run We Are Change Milwaukee, and I know this is a little off topic, but I'm going to be quick.
[03:50:35.845 --> 03:50:46.693]  The General Assembly in Milwaukee, I offered to debate some of the leaders on camera, you know, in the public eye, and they denied me!
[03:50:46.693 --> 03:50:53.298]  And I started to investigate deeper into the leadership of the Occupy Milwaukee movement,
[03:50:53.866 --> 03:51:00.209]  And I found out that one of the leaders is actually part of the Freedom Road Socialist Organization.
[03:51:12.970 --> 03:51:16.053]  And then the socialists come and don't say who they are and try to co-opt it.
[03:51:16.053 --> 03:51:17.795]  But they've pretty much failed.
[03:51:17.795 --> 03:51:20.458]  That's why they're now going to billy club them.
[03:51:20.458 --> 03:51:24.181]  It may be to actually make people have sympathy for them to get some more come out.
[03:51:24.181 --> 03:51:24.822]  I'm not sure.
[03:51:24.822 --> 03:51:28.326]  But Catherine, what's your view on the whole Occupy Wall Street situation?
[03:51:29.505 --> 03:51:31.947]  Well, you know, they're not our team, that's for sure.
[03:51:31.947 --> 03:51:34.468]  The people out there.
[03:51:34.468 --> 03:51:44.975]  And, you know, the more they call for socialism, the more the big corporations are going to say, oh, please don't throw me in the briar patch, anything but the government takeover of our business.
[03:51:44.975 --> 03:51:50.038]  They'd love nothing more for the government and the corporations to become one.
[03:51:50.578 --> 03:51:59.847]  Because then it'll be them against us, and they're gonna be like the 800-pound gorilla on their end of the teeter-totter, and we'll just be the little tiny, you know, five-pound public.
[03:51:59.847 --> 03:52:12.259]  So they would love, you know, George Soros, it's been said, is behind a lot of this stuff, because they would totally love total fascism, where the government takes over all the banks, creates a big World Bank, takes over all.
[03:52:12.779 --> 03:52:16.723]  Well, Jesse Ventura was on yesterday and he's like, I think Occupy Wall Street's good.
[03:52:16.723 --> 03:52:19.226]  At least the folks he's talked to, and I've run into a lot of them.
[03:52:19.226 --> 03:52:21.528]  You know, they're tired of Wall Street taking over Washington.
[03:52:33.340 --> 03:52:40.128]  Well, it's actually certain elements, the megabanks, the globalists that have taken it over, who've gotten the tens of trillions.
[03:52:40.128 --> 03:52:45.414]  It's not more money that's needed in taxes, it's that we need our money back that's gone offshore.
[03:52:45.414 --> 03:52:49.678]  You know, the big banks won't loan our own money we gave them and then we pay them back.
[03:52:50.626 --> 03:52:52.608]  Interest on the bailout we gave them.
[03:52:52.608 --> 03:52:54.890]  I mean that's the message you've got to get it.
[03:52:54.890 --> 03:53:12.788]  I've tried to go to Occupy Wall Street Rob Jacobson has so many others and their leaders come over and they say listen you get out of here with that Okay, we want socialism now the crowds themselves are good people and they always say there's no leader here But it turns out time and time again It is the Democratic Party.
[03:53:12.788 --> 03:53:13.269]  Sorry go ahead
[03:53:14.298 --> 03:53:18.720]  Well, I gotta say, you know, I'm all for the crowds out there because they're doing the right thing.
[03:53:18.720 --> 03:53:22.682]  They're standing up and they're trying to get up and trying to say enough is enough.
[03:53:22.682 --> 03:53:23.863]  We're sick of it.
[03:53:23.863 --> 03:53:27.885]  What is disgusting to me is what always happens.
[03:53:27.885 --> 03:53:29.185]  We saw it over in Egypt, too.
[03:53:29.185 --> 03:53:40.410]  You had the public rise up and say no, and then crafty powers that be are working behind the scenes to figure out how to take that momentum and turn it into something ugly.
[03:53:40.410 --> 03:53:43.312]  So I would say to all the Occupy folks, you guys rock.
[03:53:43.772 --> 03:53:51.735]  But be very careful who you're listening to, because if you're listening to people who say the government has to take over the corporations, you're hearing the wrong message.
[03:53:51.735 --> 03:53:53.175]  That's not going to be the solution.
[03:53:53.175 --> 03:53:59.778]  That's going to leave you even more powerless when those two forces consolidate and then together work against you.
[03:53:59.778 --> 03:54:01.078]  We're really going to be in trouble.
[03:54:01.078 --> 03:54:01.478]  You're right.
[03:54:01.478 --> 03:54:03.319]  Let's go quickly to calls.
[03:54:03.319 --> 03:54:05.320]  Ivan in Florida.
[03:54:05.320 --> 03:54:06.760]  Welcome.
[03:54:06.760 --> 03:54:07.821]  Hey, how you doing?
[03:54:07.821 --> 03:54:08.261]  Good, brother.
[03:54:09.509 --> 03:54:19.455]  Uh, I wanted to take a minute because you have, uh, Captain Albright on the show, and she's an expert in RFID technology and things of that nature.
[03:54:19.455 --> 03:54:21.236]  Right.
[03:54:21.236 --> 03:54:22.757]  Yeah, I noticed... Go ahead.
[03:54:22.757 --> 03:54:32.923]  You know, in the toll roads, how you have the scanners that read the... You can buy a SunPass, things of that nature, and you don't have to pay the tolls.
[03:54:32.923 --> 03:54:38.026]  Well, I've noticed in Orlando here, they've been putting those on public roads.
[03:54:38.942 --> 03:54:44.346]  I was wondering if that's just like a local phenomenon, or have you noticed that?
[03:54:44.346 --> 03:54:45.506]  No, it's nationwide.
[03:54:45.506 --> 03:54:51.250]  No, but let me tell you, you SunPass people were the guinea pigs, in fact.
[03:54:51.250 --> 03:55:01.377]  You guys were the very first, the SunPass down in Florida, was the first state that had those toll transponders used to experiment with traffic surveillance.
[03:55:01.377 --> 03:55:03.278]  And so what's happening now is anybody
[03:55:03.758 --> 03:55:12.901]  Stupid enough and lazy enough to have a toll transponder on their windshield instead of stopping and paying cash like all good Americans who value their freedom ought to do.
[03:55:12.901 --> 03:55:18.623]  You guys are the vanguard of total automobile tracking and it's happening right now.
[03:55:18.623 --> 03:55:21.464]  They can put a reader for that anywhere in the country.
[03:55:21.464 --> 03:55:22.924]  They're putting them in gantries.
[03:55:22.924 --> 03:55:26.786]  That's the overpasses on the freeway, miles from the toll roads.
[03:55:26.786 --> 03:55:30.687]  I saw an article, Catherine, ten years ago where San Francisco was doing it.
[03:55:31.732 --> 03:55:32.413]  That's right.
[03:55:32.413 --> 03:55:33.413]  They're doing it.
[03:55:33.413 --> 03:55:35.595]  And, you know, you want to speak about RFID.
[03:55:35.595 --> 03:55:38.817]  The other thing you don't want to do, please don't get a toll transponder.
[03:55:38.817 --> 03:55:40.819]  If you have one, get rid of it.
[03:55:40.819 --> 03:55:42.900]  My husband and I call it the privacy tax.
[03:55:42.900 --> 03:55:44.862]  We spend a little longer in line.
[03:55:44.862 --> 03:55:49.605]  We have to actually carry cash with us, but that's what protects your privacy.
[03:55:49.605 --> 03:55:56.871]  The other thing you don't want to get, and if you have one, tear it up, is an enhanced driver's license to get into Canada or Mexico.
[03:55:56.871 --> 03:55:58.152]  It's got an RFID.
[03:55:58.152 --> 03:56:00.654]  Same thing with the passport, but expanding on that, Catherine.
[03:56:01.394 --> 03:56:07.637]  It's not only that, we've got to keep using cash as much as we can, or they're going to totally phase it out.
[03:56:07.637 --> 03:56:09.058]  Amen, amen.
[03:56:09.058 --> 03:56:12.760]  So, you know, start doing your grocery shopping with cash, folks.
[03:56:12.760 --> 03:56:15.261]  Start doing everything you do with cash.
[03:56:15.261 --> 03:56:17.902]  You know, they always say use it or lose it with your muscles.
[03:56:17.902 --> 03:56:21.204]  Use it or lose it with your privacy, and especially with your cash.
[03:56:21.204 --> 03:56:27.287]  One thing I want to say, though, the passports, the booklet passports, have a read range of about two inches.
[03:56:28.827 --> 03:56:34.890]  The enhanced driver's licenses, though, have a re-range of 35 feet.
[03:56:34.890 --> 03:56:50.456]  They're not encrypted, and in fact, every Walmart that is using RFID to read the underwear shelf, not making this up, the actual underwear, can read your enhanced driver's license right through your purse or pocket as you stand there in front of the underwear.
[03:56:50.456 --> 03:56:55.878]  No exaggeration, absolutely 100%- And by the way, the globalists- Walmart can't even prevent it.
[03:56:56.434 --> 03:57:03.859]  The globalists are super ultra bold and they know that with all this RFID it's going to cause a rash of identity theft.
[03:57:03.859 --> 03:57:08.822]  Their answer will then be RFID with a biometric print.
[03:57:08.822 --> 03:57:11.203]  That's how they're going to force this in.
[03:57:11.203 --> 03:57:15.165]  I appreciate your call there from Florida.
[03:57:15.165 --> 03:57:16.246]  Good to hear from you.
[03:57:16.246 --> 03:57:17.627]  Catherine, how's your health?
[03:57:18.891 --> 03:57:20.072]  Well, you know, I'm doing good.
[03:57:20.072 --> 03:57:22.073]  I've got a new blog to let people know.
[03:57:22.073 --> 03:57:31.479]  My regular website is katherinealbrecht.com, where all my radio archives are, but I just started a blog at wordpress.katherinealbrecht.com.
[03:57:31.479 --> 03:57:34.761]  Love to hear from people, but I'm posting updates on my health.
[03:57:34.761 --> 03:57:43.067]  I am almost done with chemotherapy, starting radiation therapy, feeling actually really strong and really fantastic, so I think I'm going to beat this thing.
[03:57:44.295 --> 03:57:47.938]  Well, praise God for that and the prayers certainly won't hurt.
[03:57:47.938 --> 03:57:54.743]  Catherine, I really appreciate you spending time with us here on the fourth annual InfoWars Money Bomb.
[03:57:54.743 --> 03:57:56.164]  I look forward to speaking to you in the future.
[03:57:57.446 --> 03:58:00.168]  Hey, congrats with that 27-hour thing.
[03:58:00.168 --> 03:58:01.029]  You go, Alex.
[03:58:01.029 --> 03:58:01.949]  Hey, I just ate something.
[03:58:01.949 --> 03:58:04.291]  I'm feeling good now.
[03:58:04.291 --> 03:58:05.692]  Thank you, Catherine.
[03:58:05.692 --> 03:58:09.555]  All right, now we've got a bunch of other guests coming up, but this hour is going to be wide open.
[03:58:09.555 --> 03:58:21.243]  Michael, Tommy, and Patrick, and Jared, they need to be given off-air, John, the call-in number at our studios so I can go to them first before I give out the general number for everybody else.
[03:58:21.243 --> 03:58:21.904]  I'm going to come back.
[03:58:22.364 --> 03:58:26.428]  Into the fifth hour of the 27-hour transmission on the other side.
[03:58:26.428 --> 03:58:28.690]  It won't be on Genesis or the satellite.
[03:58:28.690 --> 03:58:36.556]  You've got to go to InfoWars.com to find the free audio and video streams right now.
[03:58:36.556 --> 03:58:39.119]  20 plus hours more coming up.
[03:58:39.119 --> 03:58:42.561]  22 hours straight ahead.
[03:58:42.561 --> 03:58:45.964]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:58:45.964 --> 03:58:47.366]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:53.504 --> 03:58:58.189]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[03:58:58.189 --> 03:59:04.637]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[03:59:04.637 --> 03:59:06.899]  Number one, study the past.
[03:59:06.899 --> 03:59:09.302]  History really does repeat itself.
[03:59:09.302 --> 03:59:13.046]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[03:59:36.684 --> 03:59:40.328]  You can run on for a long time.
[03:59:40.328 --> 03:59:42.591]  Run on for a long time.
[03:59:42.591 --> 03:59:46.114]  Run on for a long time.
[03:59:46.114 --> 03:59:49.098]  Sooner or later gonna cut you down.
[03:59:49.098 --> 03:59:51.520]  Sooner or later gonna cut you down.
[03:59:53.715 --> 04:00:08.338]  Go tell that long-tongue liar Go and tell that midnight rider Tell the rambler, the gambler, the backbiter Tell him that God's gonna cut him down Tell him that God's gonna cut him down
[04:00:13.550 --> 04:00:41.952]  Well, my goodness gracious, let me tell you the news My head's been wet with the midnight dew I've been down on bended knee Talking to the man from Galilee He spoke to me with a voice so sweet I thought I heard the shuffle of angels sweet He called my name and my heart stood still When he said, John, go do my will Go tell that long-tongued liar Go and tell that midnight rider
[04:00:42.612 --> 04:00:45.913]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[04:00:45.913 --> 04:00:49.534]  It is the 27 hour transmission.
[04:00:49.534 --> 04:00:55.236]  We've got coming up so many amazing, amazing people joining us.
[04:00:55.236 --> 04:00:58.377]  We've had Joel Skousen, Tarpley, Albrecht.
[04:00:58.377 --> 04:01:03.058]  We've got coming up in an hour George Norrie, then David Icke.
[04:01:03.058 --> 04:01:05.599]  He's over in New Zealand so we're playing with times right now.
[04:01:05.599 --> 04:01:06.739]  He may be on then or later.
[04:01:08.024 --> 04:01:08.905]  Mike Adams then.
[04:01:08.905 --> 04:01:10.587]  They're in real prime time.
[04:01:10.587 --> 04:01:14.471]  He'll sit in for two hours with us while I take my first break.
[04:01:14.471 --> 04:01:16.013]  He's going to be interviewing a bunch of folks.
[04:01:16.013 --> 04:01:19.157]  Mike Adams always informed with a bunch of breaking news.
[04:01:19.157 --> 04:01:21.820]  We've got Alfred Adask in joining us.
[04:01:21.820 --> 04:01:23.982]  We've got a bunch of time for open phones as well.
[04:01:23.982 --> 04:01:25.844]  Text Mars.
[04:01:25.844 --> 04:01:26.685]  A bunch of other people.
[04:01:26.685 --> 04:01:27.366]  Springmeyer.
[04:01:27.366 --> 04:01:28.707]  Aaron Dykes.
[04:01:29.828 --> 04:01:44.599]  Um, Corbett, Watson, Reeves, Salente, Jim Mars, Alan Watt, Bob Chapman, and we're going to premiere, and of course Aaron always has to make something the very best and fancy, which is great.
[04:01:44.599 --> 04:01:50.963]  In the last six months, he's worked off and on on this interview with Charlotte Isserby dealing with skull and bones.
[04:01:50.963 --> 04:01:52.724]  A lot of this has never been reported before.
[04:01:52.724 --> 04:01:56.167]  She's the person that gave Anthony Sutton stuff that he put out that blew it wide open.
[04:01:57.182 --> 04:02:03.725]  Well, her dad was Skull and Bones and some other family, and she went into more detail than anybody ever has.
[04:02:03.725 --> 04:02:08.487]  And Aaron has been off and on, like three or four days, working on this.
[04:02:08.487 --> 04:02:09.627]  Working on it.
[04:02:09.627 --> 04:02:15.230]  There's nothing like a deadline to get something done, because he's always busy doing other videos and other reports, just like I am.
[04:02:15.230 --> 04:02:19.351]  It's hard to do new stuff or get other things done, because you're always tied down with a bunch of other work.
[04:02:19.351 --> 04:02:20.592]  That's why we're doing this Money Bomb.
[04:02:21.837 --> 04:02:32.540]  To hire another video editor, another researcher, reporter, trying to find somebody like Aaron Dykes who understands all this stuff.
[04:02:32.540 --> 04:02:41.403]  We want to hire four or five more people so we also have some depth, a little bit of depth so it's not just all of us constantly killing ourselves to get this info out.
[04:02:42.765 --> 04:02:45.347]  And a bunch of equipment we need to get.
[04:02:45.347 --> 04:02:48.289]  And a few crew members around here deserve a little raise or something.
[04:02:48.289 --> 04:02:51.631]  It's always good to do that for their hard fighting.
[04:02:51.631 --> 04:02:58.576]  So again, if you believe in what we're doing, it's free will, you're not forced to do it like the government does, coming and taking your money and making you do it.
[04:02:58.576 --> 04:03:01.678]  Donate at InfoWars.com.
[04:03:01.678 --> 04:03:04.800]  You can also go to InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[04:03:04.800 --> 04:03:07.122]  And you can donate $5, $10,000.
[04:03:07.122 --> 04:03:10.985]  But I do not want people donating who are in bad straits right now.
[04:03:12.438 --> 04:03:18.161]  I'm not like the government that comes and takes your house when you can't pay your bills or your property tax.
[04:03:18.161 --> 04:03:34.188]  Or I'm not like the government that, you know, I'm here saying if you have means and you like what we're doing and you want to see more of it and you appreciate the level that we're contending with the globalists at, then I absolutely want to
[04:03:37.532 --> 04:03:48.457]  Expand what we're doing, and if you believe in that, please donate at InfoWars.com or at InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[04:03:48.457 --> 04:03:52.959]  You can also donate by buying the books, the t-shirts, the bumper stickers.
[04:03:52.959 --> 04:03:56.301]  I mean, at a certain point, the bumper stickers we actually make no money on.
[04:03:57.242 --> 04:03:59.263]  No money on.
[04:03:59.263 --> 04:04:02.145]  You'll notice our prices just go down, down, down, down, down.
[04:04:02.145 --> 04:04:05.907]  Because all I care about is shipping masses of stuff out that warehouse.
[04:04:05.907 --> 04:04:07.728]  It's not about the money.
[04:04:07.728 --> 04:04:11.470]  I mean, it's okay to have a car that's, you know, three, four years old so it doesn't break down.
[04:04:11.470 --> 04:04:13.351]  It's nice to have a house that's comfortable.
[04:04:13.351 --> 04:04:16.272]  You know, have a mattress that is comfortable.
[04:04:16.272 --> 04:04:20.435]  But, you know, you notice you don't see me wearing makeup here.
[04:04:20.435 --> 04:04:22.176]  You notice I'm not worried my hair's falling out.
[04:04:24.062 --> 04:04:26.203]  I'm not very worldly, folks.
[04:04:26.203 --> 04:04:31.105]  Unless, in a worldly sense, I like to knock bullies' teeth out.
[04:04:31.105 --> 04:04:34.047]  I guess physically or politically.
[04:04:34.047 --> 04:04:35.888]  The point is, is that
[04:04:38.635 --> 04:04:41.616]  I want to wage war on these people via the Infowar.
[04:04:41.616 --> 04:04:44.138]  I know they're coming in with the censorship, the control.
[04:04:44.138 --> 04:04:49.980]  We need to launch more operations, more tentacles, because they've got their tentacles everywhere.
[04:04:49.980 --> 04:04:57.964]  We need to put our runners out even more and continue to replicate what we're doing and expanding it, because we are hitting pay dirt in the Infowar.
[04:04:58.524 --> 04:05:00.305]  We are hurting the globalists.
[04:05:00.305 --> 04:05:01.985]  They absolutely don't know what to do.
[04:05:01.985 --> 04:05:08.188]  They're hitting us from every angle with COINTELPRO, disinformation operatives, attacks, and it's just not working.
[04:05:08.188 --> 04:05:13.530]  In fact, it's actually advertised us and who we are and what we're doing here at the InfoWar.
[04:05:13.530 --> 04:05:19.413]  So again, my friends, I've been on air now, you know, for only four hours.
[04:05:20.833 --> 04:05:23.834]  I tell you, it's Murphy's Law that I usually don't wake up in the middle of the night and go back to sleep.
[04:05:23.834 --> 04:05:28.496]  I woke up at 4 a.m., tried to go back to sleep, and I actually feel hammered today.
[04:05:28.496 --> 04:05:30.996]  But I'll hit my second and third and fourth wind.
[04:05:30.996 --> 04:05:33.437]  I really don't feel worthy to be doing this.
[04:05:33.437 --> 04:05:35.578]  I mean, I'm bringing you such incredible news.
[04:05:35.578 --> 04:05:40.259]  Such amazing, earth-shattering things are now unfolding.
[04:05:40.259 --> 04:05:42.580]  And I am just exhausted.
[04:05:43.513 --> 04:05:46.334]  I mean, we're up here until 9, 10 o'clock every night now.
[04:05:46.334 --> 04:05:50.276]  My children are growing up in front of me and I hardly see them one day a week.
[04:05:50.276 --> 04:05:51.317]  And I'm not complaining.
[04:05:51.317 --> 04:05:56.279]  It's just that I'm throwing my full self into this and against this.
[04:05:56.279 --> 04:06:02.662]  And you have made us strong with your support, buying the books, the videos, spreading the word about the show.
[04:06:02.662 --> 04:06:04.522]  You are the reason we've had this much success.
[04:06:04.522 --> 04:06:06.743]  Now, we're small, but we're strong.
[04:06:06.743 --> 04:06:08.144]  Our organization is small.
[04:06:08.144 --> 04:06:11.305]  Our amount of money is small compared to large institutions.
[04:06:14.517 --> 04:06:18.078]  The bang for the buck, we are really having a huge effect.
[04:06:18.078 --> 04:06:21.978]  Now, we've launched our internal phone system.
[04:06:21.978 --> 04:06:26.679]  I tried to get the five or six calls at Genesis that were the longest holding over so we could take your calls.
[04:06:26.679 --> 04:06:29.540]  That phone system will be up where I can see it soon.
[04:06:29.540 --> 04:06:32.800]  I've got a whole cornucopia of news I haven't even gotten to yet.
[04:06:32.800 --> 04:06:34.020]  After I take calls, I will.
[04:06:34.020 --> 04:06:37.981]  We've got a bunch of guests coming up, obviously, as well.
[04:06:37.981 --> 04:06:41.942]  But I want to encourage, I want to encourage
[04:06:43.444 --> 04:06:55.892]  All of the people that are out there to be part of what we're doing, and there's nothing like donating to it to help us get this job done.
[04:06:55.892 --> 04:07:09.940]  So if you've donated and passed money bombs and you want to see us continue, who can deny we've expanded, we've launched more operations, the nightly news, hired more people, reporters, and that we're reaching people at a level never before imagined.
[04:07:09.940 --> 04:07:11.401]  And I now know
[04:07:13.496 --> 04:07:15.318]  That we can go even higher in this fight.
[04:07:15.318 --> 04:07:16.958]  And there's great danger associated with that.
[04:07:16.958 --> 04:07:19.560]  But I'm not going to do this at half speed.
[04:07:19.560 --> 04:07:21.461]  I'm going all the way here.
[04:07:21.461 --> 04:07:23.963]  That's why we do a 27-hour transmission.
[04:07:23.963 --> 04:07:25.043]  That's what it's really all about.
[04:07:25.043 --> 04:07:28.785]  And I couldn't do it without your support and the great job the crew does.
[04:07:28.785 --> 04:07:32.227]  But like I said, I want to get some more crew people so we're not always stumbling around exhausted.
[04:07:32.227 --> 04:07:33.528]  I want to get some more equipment.
[04:07:33.528 --> 04:07:35.910]  So donate right now at info wars money bomb.
[04:07:36.810 --> 04:07:46.037]  You know, a lot of you middle class and wealthy people out there who know this stuff's all real and you listen to the show, but you sit back there and think you're going to stay on the fence.
[04:07:46.037 --> 04:07:54.183]  If you're not going to donate or spread the word about this show or buy one of my DVDs and make a thousand copies of it and give it to people you know, you better go broker some time.
[04:07:54.183 --> 04:07:55.904]  It's cheap on local AM station.
[04:07:55.904 --> 04:07:57.105]  Do your own show.
[04:07:57.105 --> 04:07:58.306]  You better start a website.
[04:07:58.306 --> 04:08:00.067]  You better start a local newspaper.
[04:08:00.067 --> 04:08:02.048]  You better go down to city council.
[04:08:02.048 --> 04:08:05.231]  I mean, I'm telling you, we need all good men and women to come to the aid of humanity.
[04:08:05.911 --> 04:08:08.392]  This is all in right now.
[04:08:08.392 --> 04:08:13.015]  This is an all-in operation.
[04:08:13.015 --> 04:08:16.277]  I want everybody to go to InfoWars.com and order the bumper stickers.
[04:08:16.277 --> 04:08:20.019]  We've got them at cost, whether it's packs of 15 or a thousand.
[04:08:20.019 --> 04:08:25.422]  It's all available there right now at InfoWars.com to help spread this message, to get out front.
[04:08:26.772 --> 04:08:37.199]  Warrantless checkpoints, microphones in the trees and the telephone poles, total control, cancer viruses in the vaccines, GMO everywhere.
[04:08:37.199 --> 04:08:42.823]  I mean, wars, torture, secret arrest, a Nobel Prize winner launching all these wars.
[04:08:42.823 --> 04:08:46.785]  I mean, God Almighty, we got to turn this around together.
[04:08:46.785 --> 04:08:47.666]  And we're so close.
[04:08:47.666 --> 04:08:49.427]  People now know about the Federal Reserve.
[04:08:49.427 --> 04:08:51.048]  They now know about the New World Order.
[04:08:51.048 --> 04:08:52.889]  The globalists are now very unpopular.
[04:08:52.889 --> 04:08:55.011]  A decade ago, nobody even knew who they were.
[04:08:55.011 --> 04:08:56.432]  Maybe 2% of the population.
[04:08:57.553 --> 04:09:02.582]  We have come so far with the move to audit the Fed and abolish it.
[04:09:02.582 --> 04:09:05.788]  We can go so much further together.
[04:09:05.788 --> 04:09:09.254]  But more importantly than even donating, spread the word about InfoWars.com.
[04:09:10.450 --> 04:09:12.553]  Spread the word about PrisonPlanet.tv.
[04:09:12.553 --> 04:09:18.700]  Spread the word about our free YouTube channel with 150 million views and growing just on one channel where it's all posted right there too.
[04:09:18.700 --> 04:09:20.982]  Just appreciate the information.
[04:09:20.982 --> 04:09:24.647]  Realize people have gone through a lot of trouble to bring you this.
[04:09:24.647 --> 04:09:27.230]  A lot of people died to bring you this information.
[04:09:27.230 --> 04:09:28.651]  I've interviewed a lot of people who've been murdered.
[04:09:29.443 --> 04:09:30.364]  Okay?
[04:09:30.364 --> 04:09:34.486]  But we're standing in the sunshine, out in the light, as Jim Garrison said, that's the best defense.
[04:09:34.486 --> 04:09:41.291]  Now, I want to show you just a smattering of some of what we've done, and we're going to come back after a few of these and go right to your calls.
[04:09:41.291 --> 04:09:53.919]  The number to join us is 877-789-ALEX, 877-789-ALEX, and you'll be on, those of you, we don't get to right away, you'll be on with Norie, you'll be on with David Eich, all the folks that are coming up.
[04:09:53.919 --> 04:09:57.261]  Mike Adams is coming up as well.
[04:09:57.261 --> 04:09:57.682]  I've got
[04:09:59.079 --> 04:10:01.740]  Twelve of the reports Darren McBrain just happened to grab.
[04:10:01.740 --> 04:10:04.941]  Special reports, subliminal messages from the nightly news.
[04:10:04.941 --> 04:10:13.024]  Denver airport, new oral order, art, citizens punished for courting bad cops, 9-11 street poll, Facebook, pre-crime scanner technology.
[04:10:14.295 --> 04:10:18.938]  Public Reacts to Fed Raids on Gibson Guitars, NFL Grope Downs.
[04:10:18.938 --> 04:10:19.698]  Take this first one.
[04:10:19.698 --> 04:10:21.539]  We're going to play three or four of these.
[04:10:21.539 --> 04:10:25.181]  Whatever Jaren wants to play first.
[04:10:25.181 --> 04:10:26.762]  I told him the ones I wanted and I can't remember now.
[04:10:26.762 --> 04:10:28.103]  Which ones?
[04:10:28.103 --> 04:10:31.044]  We're going to play Subliminal first.
[04:10:31.044 --> 04:10:35.947]  I remembered that one, but the point is, after you watch this, record it and pause it.
[04:10:35.947 --> 04:10:38.608]  Because you see the Sharpie ad and it says,
[04:10:40.982 --> 04:10:45.168]  Stop protesting, and then a guy holds a sign up saying, now.
[04:10:45.168 --> 04:10:46.930]  That's all subliminal.
[04:10:46.930 --> 04:10:51.015]  And you see the, you know, the stuff where Ron Paul supporters are drug addicts.
[04:10:51.015 --> 04:10:54.720]  I mean, this is a guy, anything you watch that's global is funded.
[04:10:54.720 --> 04:10:57.463]  99% of these national shows have it.
[04:10:58.266 --> 04:10:59.987]  I mean, it is just everywhere.
[04:10:59.987 --> 04:11:02.669]  And because your subconscious mind absorbs it, the rest doesn't.
[04:11:02.669 --> 04:11:03.470]  We got that report.
[04:11:03.470 --> 04:11:07.393]  We'll play a few more and then come back and go to your phone calls.
[04:11:07.393 --> 04:11:08.974]  And we'll take a lot of calls throughout the evening.
[04:11:08.974 --> 04:11:11.896]  We're going to start going to calls right now.
[04:11:11.896 --> 04:11:13.177]  But again, InfoWars Moneybomb.
[04:11:13.217 --> 04:11:13.637]  Thank you.
[04:11:30.552 --> 04:11:32.133]  To everybody you know.
[04:11:32.133 --> 04:11:39.156]  But we'll be right back after a few of these InfoWars Nightly News reports, followed by Darren McBreen and others.
[04:11:39.156 --> 04:11:43.758]  And we want to get more reporters and just expand this, because we're reaching millions of people with this.
[04:11:43.758 --> 04:11:48.300]  And it's not just Alex Jones up here reading news and ranting and raving and putting out two films a year.
[04:11:48.300 --> 04:11:54.183]  This way we're hitting them every night with information like this, because nobody else has stepped up to do it.
[04:12:15.549 --> 04:12:23.998]  Every day, our senses are being constantly bombarded by subliminal messages that are found in TV, movies, and advertisements.
[04:12:25.543 --> 04:12:35.889]  The subliminal messages we are subjected to are unrecognizable by the conscious mind and only recognizable in our subconscious mind.
[04:12:35.889 --> 04:12:50.258]  The messages and imagery are passively absorbed and then stored in our subconscious, where propagandists deliberately implant artificial thoughts, which in turn can affect our actions and attitudes later in life.
[04:13:02.330 --> 04:13:18.704]  Experiments have shown that less than one minute after the viewer begins to watch television, the brain switches from beta-level consciousness, associated with active and logical thought, to alpha-level, which is associated with passive acceptance and suggestibility.
[04:13:18.704 --> 04:13:25.769]  This is why advertisers spend billions of dollars a year on commercials, as well as product placement within TV shows.
[04:13:27.011 --> 04:13:36.939]  Political messages are implanted in fictional TV programs as the relaxed meditative state of the viewer is receptive to the programming.
[04:13:36.939 --> 04:13:44.565]  One example is AMC's Breaking Bad television series as it depicts a meth villain as a Ron Paul supporter.
[04:13:44.565 --> 04:13:45.725]  I looked him up.
[04:13:45.725 --> 04:13:48.227]  It's one of these Hitler's guys.
[04:13:48.227 --> 04:13:50.849]  A physicist named Werner Heisenberg.
[04:13:50.849 --> 04:13:51.490]  Real cute, huh?
[04:13:51.710 --> 04:14:12.886]  In a basic college-level marketing class, in your first year of radio, television, and film, at least for me, and then I've seen some other textbooks and curriculum and found it's also in those, but most RTF schooling teaches you that they have had subliminals for at least 70 years in the United States and Europe.
[04:14:12.886 --> 04:14:16.049]  And so, yes, there is subliminal messaging everywhere.
[04:14:16.049 --> 04:14:17.570]  It is all over the place.
[04:14:18.243 --> 04:14:30.189]  It's an absolute fact that they flicker it at a rate and that they have the televisions designed for that rate to bring you into a dreamlike state.
[04:14:30.189 --> 04:14:36.713]  I mean, it is a fact that within minutes you go into a dream brainwave when watching television.
[04:14:36.713 --> 04:14:42.676]  Go read a book by the father of modern advertising, Edward Bernays, where he calls you a dumb slave and admits they run your whole life.
[04:14:44.210 --> 04:14:45.591]  I've read both his major books.
[04:14:45.591 --> 04:14:47.431]  One of them is called Propaganda.
[04:14:47.431 --> 04:14:50.813]  Edward Bernays.
[04:14:50.813 --> 04:14:59.917]  The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society.
[04:14:59.917 --> 04:15:09.541]  Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government, which is the true ruling power of our country.
[04:15:10.552 --> 04:15:11.994]  We are governed.
[04:15:11.994 --> 04:15:13.497]  Our minds are molded.
[04:15:13.497 --> 04:15:15.280]  Our tastes are formed.
[04:15:15.280 --> 04:15:19.647]  Our ideas suggested, largely by men we've never heard of.
[04:15:19.647 --> 04:15:24.715]  This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized.
[04:15:35.455 --> 04:15:38.936]  Hi Alex, I'm Darren McBreen for InfoWars Nightly News.
[04:15:38.936 --> 04:15:44.459]  We're here at the University of Texas in Austin just days before the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[04:15:44.459 --> 04:15:49.381]  And we're wondering how many people are aware that there was a third tower that fell.
[04:15:49.381 --> 04:15:58.785]  Building 7, which was not hit by a plane, but collapsed demolition style at 5.20pm, many hours after the first two towers fell.
[04:15:58.785 --> 04:16:00.025]  What are your thoughts when you see that?
[04:16:00.025 --> 04:16:01.846]  This was not hit by an airplane.
[04:16:01.846 --> 04:16:04.467]  It collapsed many hours after the first two towers fell.
[04:16:04.947 --> 04:16:09.190]  I mean, it sort of looks like a planned demolition, but it could also be a lot of other things.
[04:16:09.190 --> 04:16:10.671]  Oh, wow.
[04:16:10.671 --> 04:16:11.972]  Have you ever seen that video before?
[04:16:11.972 --> 04:16:12.892]  I have, actually.
[04:16:12.892 --> 04:16:21.058]  It was, um... This is weird, but it was one of those conspiracy videos I saw, but, yeah, it was pretty crazy, the video I saw.
[04:16:21.058 --> 04:16:22.759]  It just, like, dropped straight down.
[04:16:22.759 --> 04:16:24.040]  Have you ever seen the video before?
[04:16:24.040 --> 04:16:26.401]  Uh, not at that building, no.
[04:16:26.401 --> 04:16:26.582]  No.
[04:16:26.582 --> 04:16:33.606]  Do you find it interesting that it was not featured in the 9-11 Commission report?
[04:16:33.606 --> 04:16:34.487]  It wasn't featured at all?
[04:16:35.748 --> 04:16:36.690]  That is interesting.
[04:16:36.690 --> 04:16:37.291]  That is interesting.
[04:16:37.291 --> 04:16:40.337]  It looked, uh, you know, it was a very controlled blast it seemed.
[04:16:40.337 --> 04:16:42.802]  What are your thoughts when you see that building go down like that?
[04:16:44.180 --> 04:16:47.102]  Um, I don't really know what happened to it.
[04:16:47.102 --> 04:16:50.203]  I don't think anyone, like, the government probably wouldn't tell us.
[04:16:50.203 --> 04:16:57.327]  I'm actually in the College of Architecture as a grad student and have seen several demolitions and it does look completely controlled.
[04:16:57.327 --> 04:16:59.388]  I mean, it looked like a controlled demolition.
[04:16:59.388 --> 04:17:04.230]  It didn't look like the explosion happened from, like, one side, like, coming in or anything like that.
[04:17:04.230 --> 04:17:08.833]  It looked like it kind of happened from the bottom and just kind of imploded on itself.
[04:17:08.833 --> 04:17:10.433]  Is that the first time you've seen the video?
[04:17:10.433 --> 04:17:11.634]  Yes, definitely.
[04:17:11.634 --> 04:17:13.255]  That's the first time I've ever seen that, yeah.
[04:17:14.005 --> 04:17:16.106]  This is my first time actually hearing about Building 7.
[04:17:16.106 --> 04:17:21.427]  So, you know, that tells you how much they've covered it, but that's very weird.
[04:17:21.427 --> 04:17:24.908]  It really looks like a demolition implosion.
[04:17:24.908 --> 04:17:26.168]  I don't remember seeing it at all.
[04:17:26.168 --> 04:17:33.730]  I remember watching both the second tower collapse live, and I don't remember hearing or seeing anything at the time about that.
[04:17:34.292 --> 04:17:44.642]  As most of the InfoWars audience is aware, World Trade Center leaseholder Larry Silverstein gave the okay to pull the building moments before Building 7 collapsed.
[04:17:44.642 --> 04:17:50.989]  BBC's Jane Stanley even reported Building 7's collapse minutes before the event actually happened.
[04:17:50.989 --> 04:17:55.013]  You can even see Building 7 clearly behind her as she gives the report.
[04:17:56.215 --> 04:18:01.759]  Yesterday I watched a video where a news lady was talking and she said the third building just fell.
[04:18:01.759 --> 04:18:04.941]  But behind her, the third building had not fallen yet.
[04:18:04.941 --> 04:18:05.801]  So that's weird.
[04:18:05.801 --> 04:18:06.842]  Jane Stanley.
[04:18:06.842 --> 04:18:07.863]  You saw that then?
[04:18:07.863 --> 04:18:08.283]  Yeah.
[04:18:08.283 --> 04:18:09.223]  Oh, of course, of course.
[04:18:09.223 --> 04:18:11.405]  She's like, oh it fell down and it's still behind her.
[04:18:11.405 --> 04:18:15.888]  You would think that she would wait until it fell, even if she had insider information that the thing was going down.
[04:18:15.888 --> 04:18:18.609]  She has some sort of ESP.
[04:18:18.609 --> 04:18:25.494]  There are currently close to 1,500 architects and engineers who are saying that it was indeed a controlled demolition.
[04:18:26.482 --> 04:18:35.625]  Well, I mean, that's the kind of thing where we need some sort of investigation, you know, and if the government isn't going to do this for investigating, then we need a third party to step in and, you know, have the authority and the resources to do that.
[04:18:35.625 --> 04:18:38.406]  I mean, like, a lot of people, you know, question the Warren Commission.
[04:18:38.406 --> 04:18:41.187]  That doesn't make all of them kooks or conspiracy theorists.
[04:18:41.187 --> 04:18:44.849]  What do you feel about losing a lot of our civil liberties since 9-11?
[04:18:47.004 --> 04:18:49.065]  Uh, it sucks.
[04:18:49.065 --> 04:18:56.627]  You know, you have, you know, people that can invade your phone calls and text messages and emails, and so you really don't have any privacy.
[04:18:56.627 --> 04:18:58.427]  And that, that really scares me.
[04:18:58.427 --> 04:19:02.669]  I think the 9-11 was sort of the Trojan horse for all that sort of policy to come in.
[04:19:02.669 --> 04:19:04.689]  If you notice, there's free speech zones.
[04:19:04.689 --> 04:19:07.210]  We can only free speech in certain areas now.
[04:19:07.210 --> 04:19:11.511]  So, yeah, it's almost like everything that we once had is slowly shrinking.
[04:19:11.511 --> 04:19:14.112]  Is it worth it to make us more safe, to lose our liberties?
[04:19:15.032 --> 04:19:16.113]  No, certainly not.
[04:19:16.113 --> 04:19:28.378]  I mean, you know, 9-11 was a terrible event, but in terms of the things that have happened since then making us more safe, I'd say that's the other side of the coin.
[04:19:28.378 --> 04:19:32.680]  Do you think there needs to be a new investigation into September 11th?
[04:19:34.167 --> 04:19:35.168]  I don't think it would hurt.
[04:19:35.168 --> 04:19:44.696]  I don't know how much we would know about it or, again, maybe how unbiased it would be, but I think it always is something that is interesting to look at further.
[04:19:44.696 --> 04:19:47.618]  I think America should demand a new investigation.
[04:19:47.618 --> 04:19:53.423]  Definitely be interesting to see things that I'm sure the government didn't want the public knowing at the time.
[04:19:53.423 --> 04:19:55.485]  The only way to get to the bottom of it is to do more research.
[04:19:56.275 --> 04:19:58.220]  I don't disagree the government's corrupt.
[04:19:58.220 --> 04:19:58.902]  Everyone lies.
[04:19:58.902 --> 04:20:05.038]  I don't think people should just put all their faith and trust in a government who's just completely selfish and only worry about themselves.
[04:20:05.458 --> 04:20:13.865]  Ten years after 9-11, we can see that much of the public is aware that they're not being told everything there is to know about the tragic events of that day.
[04:20:13.865 --> 04:20:18.608]  The mainstream media, however, continues to avoid discussing Building 7.
[04:20:18.608 --> 04:20:26.094]  Instead, they insist on pushing the official fable and ridicule any American who demands a new investigation.
[04:20:26.094 --> 04:20:28.917]  I'm Darren McBrain for InfoWars Nightly News.
[04:20:29.597 --> 04:20:30.137]  Back to you, Alex.
[04:20:30.137 --> 04:20:33.420]  I'm Darren McBreen for InfoWars Nightly News.
[04:20:33.420 --> 04:20:36.041]  The Green Police have struck again.
[04:20:36.041 --> 04:20:51.692]  First it was the Amish selling eggs, and then it was children's lemonade stands, followed by SWAT teaming people for selling tomatoes, and now it's Gibson Guitar, one of the few iconic American companies we've got left exporting goods to the world.
[04:20:52.594 --> 04:20:56.979]  Now we're about to show you a TV commercial that started airing during the Super Bowl.
[04:20:56.979 --> 04:21:02.966]  What appears to be light-hearted by most viewers is actually a very serious sign of dark times ahead.
[04:21:02.966 --> 04:21:06.910]  Okay, so it's 3708, paper or plastic?
[04:21:06.910 --> 04:21:07.231]  Plastic.
[04:21:07.694 --> 04:21:08.514]  That's the magic word.
[04:21:08.514 --> 04:21:10.115]  Green police.
[04:21:10.115 --> 04:21:12.816]  You picked the wrong day to mess with the ecosystem, plastic boy.
[04:21:12.816 --> 04:21:15.296]  Battery!
[04:21:15.296 --> 04:21:16.077]  Battery.
[04:21:16.077 --> 04:21:16.477]  Let's go!
[04:21:16.477 --> 04:21:17.077]  Take the house!
[04:21:17.077 --> 04:21:19.378]  Come on!
[04:21:19.378 --> 04:21:20.618]  Put the rind down!
[04:21:20.618 --> 04:21:20.758]  Sir!
[04:21:20.758 --> 04:21:26.560]  That's a compost infraction!
[04:21:26.560 --> 04:21:26.940]  Whoa!
[04:21:26.940 --> 04:21:28.661]  Do you install these bulbs?
[04:21:30.108 --> 04:21:35.310]  Tragedy strikes tonight where a man has just been arrested for possession of an incandescent light bulb.
[04:21:35.310 --> 04:21:37.570]  What do you guys think about plastic bottles now?
[04:21:37.570 --> 04:21:38.651]  The water setting is at 105.
[04:21:38.651 --> 04:21:46.973]  We got a TDI here.
[04:21:46.973 --> 04:21:47.694]  Clean diesel.
[04:21:47.694 --> 04:21:48.454]  You're good to go, sir.
[04:21:58.527 --> 04:21:59.508]  Good afternoon, officers.
[04:21:59.508 --> 04:22:01.289]  Are those foam cuffs you're drinking from?
[04:22:01.289 --> 04:22:01.389]  Yeah.
[04:22:01.389 --> 04:22:03.810]  Can the police step out of the car and put them on the hood?
[04:22:03.810 --> 04:22:08.714]  Here in downtown Austin, near 6th Street, music is played live every night of the week.
[04:22:08.714 --> 04:22:16.619]  Musicians are known to routinely travel far and wide to get here, but with new federal regulations, it might not be that easy.
[04:22:16.619 --> 04:22:25.385]  If you're trying to fly to Canada, for example, and you have a guitar that's 50 years old, they could stop you from traveling, they could take your guitar, and you could even be fined.
[04:22:25.385 --> 04:22:27.266]  That sounds like a
[04:22:28.001 --> 04:22:34.090]  Pretty typical of a trend of loosely worded and selectively enforced laws that's been happening for a while.
[04:22:34.090 --> 04:22:35.091]  You see them popping up more and more.
[04:22:35.091 --> 04:22:36.433]  That doesn't shock me.
[04:22:36.433 --> 04:22:38.216]  Just another crackdown.
[04:22:38.216 --> 04:22:39.017]  When's it going to stop?
[04:22:39.017 --> 04:22:41.280]  What else are they going to take?
[04:22:41.280 --> 04:22:43.924]  They're writing people for the wood.
[04:22:44.935 --> 04:22:45.655]  Old wood?
[04:22:45.655 --> 04:22:49.317]  I mean, if this precedent goes through, where does it stop?
[04:22:49.317 --> 04:22:57.601]  If it's from another country, it's been exported, then there's gonna be these laws that say that if I try to leave the country with my baby, that they're gonna take it from me or find me?
[04:22:57.601 --> 04:22:59.062]  That's not fair, man.
[04:22:59.062 --> 04:23:04.945]  You know, I'm not even a musician, but, you know, being in that community, that just makes me feel totally violated and vulnerable.
[04:23:05.345 --> 04:23:10.708]  It kind of reminds me of, um, the way, like, Monsanto tries to restrict home gardens and say they're organic farms.
[04:23:10.708 --> 04:23:18.872]  By doing that, they're trying to take more of our civil liberties, and they're basically, they're just basically trying to strip all our rights and show us their cards.
[04:23:18.872 --> 04:23:23.715]  It doesn't seem to be a due process sort of situation in the slightest, and it seems to be much more far-reaching.
[04:23:24.275 --> 04:23:32.566]  If you get on a plane and you want to travel out to country, there's a chance that if you have a guitar with you, let's say it's an older guitar, that you could be restricted.
[04:23:32.566 --> 04:23:35.670]  You could be fined or they could even take your guitar from you.
[04:23:35.670 --> 04:23:37.653]  What do you think about that?
[04:23:37.653 --> 04:23:41.258]  I say Big Brother's wreaking havoc on the free world every step of the way.
[04:23:42.947 --> 04:23:56.213]  Well, it looks like due process under the law and being innocent before being proven guilty are two concepts that are apparently no longer applicable in the United States, at least as far as the federal government is concerned.
[04:23:56.213 --> 04:23:59.874]  I'm Darren McBrain for InfoWars Nightly News.
[04:23:59.874 --> 04:24:00.635]  Back to you, Alex.
[04:24:02.287 --> 04:24:12.350]  Recently, Homeland Security announced that they will extend their Stasi-style grope downs on innocent law-abiding American citizens who simply want to watch a football game.
[04:24:12.350 --> 04:24:21.732]  Now, we're here at DKR Stadium in the heart of Austin, Texas, to ask football fans how they feel about the new Homeland Security pat-downs.
[04:24:21.732 --> 04:24:24.853]  Having people pat down before they come in, I don't think that would
[04:24:25.697 --> 04:24:28.079]  Like the cost and benefit doesn't make sense.
[04:24:28.079 --> 04:24:36.384]  If they have to wait in this big crowd and big lines and then still get checked just to go in to see like their favorite players, it might create some personal problems.
[04:24:36.934 --> 04:24:39.955]  I feel like people are always going to find a way if they want to do bad things.
[04:24:39.955 --> 04:24:51.961]  If someone really wants to do something, most likely they're going to do it, and they're going to find a way to sneak it through, but the more roadblocks you put up there, I guess the harder it's going to be, the more you might deter somebody from trying.
[04:24:51.961 --> 04:24:54.142]  Really, I think it's kind of going overboard.
[04:24:54.142 --> 04:24:55.063]  I'm not really for it.
[04:24:55.063 --> 04:24:58.584]  I don't think that it really will get anything accomplished.
[04:24:58.584 --> 04:25:05.568]  You know, you had the guy who tased the individual, and that situation was big, and I don't want to get tased, so in a way, it's...
[04:25:06.716 --> 04:25:08.618]  Hey, that's security.
[04:25:08.618 --> 04:25:09.499]  It's what needs to happen.
[04:25:09.499 --> 04:25:12.382]  But in another way, it's really intrusive.
[04:25:12.382 --> 04:25:15.165]  Having Homeland Security at the entrance of the gates could...
[04:25:16.089 --> 04:25:19.652]  Potentially make it safer, but I also feel like it's a violation of privacy.
[04:25:19.652 --> 04:25:29.802]  Last Friday, Alex Jones called for a boycott of the NFL in his attempt to prevent America from continuing down its path to becoming a nightmare police state.
[04:25:29.802 --> 04:25:32.245]  Don't be part of this ritual of corruption.
[04:25:32.245 --> 04:25:36.769]  Boycott it, and even if you don't, go to NFL games, talk about boycotting it.
[04:25:36.909 --> 04:25:45.274]  This USA Today poll on September 16th clearly demonstrates that most Americans disagree with these aggressive procedures.
[04:25:45.274 --> 04:25:48.876]  But the federal government and Homeland Security don't care.
[04:25:48.876 --> 04:25:56.040]  Even though it's a clear violation of our constitutionally guaranteed Fourth Amendment rights, they're moving forward with their plans.
[04:25:56.420 --> 04:26:11.836]  You know a lot of privacy advocates are in an outrage as far as, and this goes with the TSA and airports as well, about children that are being subjected to the same pat-downs and where do you draw the line and what's your feelings about, you know, taking your kids to a football game and they have to be patted down as well?
[04:26:12.389 --> 04:26:27.238]  I can understand their reasoning for doing that, just because terrorist attacks can come through any ways and they would do anything just to get whatever accomplished, but I think that at football games, doing that to children is just a little bit over the line.
[04:26:27.238 --> 04:26:28.639]  I don't think children need to be pat down.
[04:26:29.377 --> 04:26:33.480]  It would be an arbitrary age, around 13, I think would be acceptable.
[04:26:33.480 --> 04:26:37.763]  Underneath that age, I think, you should give children their space.
[04:26:37.763 --> 04:26:47.109]  Yeah, if you've got kids with you, especially, you know, you bring your son, your daughter, I don't know, it's a nice feeling that, okay, a little bit of a hassle slowed the line down, but I feel safe.
[04:26:47.109 --> 04:26:50.731]  I would hope that, you know, reasonable minds would prevail.
[04:26:50.731 --> 04:26:56.155]  Maybe just say, you know, an 8-year-old kid that's not going to be carrying a ball of some sort.
[04:26:56.155 --> 04:26:57.676]  I would hope it doesn't get that far.
[04:26:57.676 --> 04:26:58.797]  If I have something where
[04:26:59.937 --> 04:27:04.900]  I don't feel like I should be touched, or I had a situation where I've been touched before and I didn't appreciate that one.
[04:27:04.900 --> 04:27:10.444]  I'm clearly not going to appreciate somebody who feels like they deserve to have to do it for security reasons.
[04:27:10.444 --> 04:27:13.846]  Like, that's not a good reason to be that intrusive to my body.
[04:27:13.846 --> 04:27:23.231]  The unholy alliance between the NFL and the federal government is merely the next stop on the road to transforming America into one giant prison camp.
[04:27:23.231 --> 04:27:25.073]  A tremendous price to pay.
[04:27:25.073 --> 04:27:28.735]  And as you can see, most people don't feel it makes them any safer.
[04:27:29.335 --> 04:27:32.638]  I'm Darren McBreen for InfoWars Nightly News.
[04:27:32.638 --> 04:27:38.484]  Alex, back to you.
[04:27:38.484 --> 04:27:53.759]  I'm Darren McBreen with InfoWars Nightly News and I'm here today at the Texas State Capitol and we're about to find out if the people of Austin are aware that they are about to be hit by a wave of utility bill hikes as new EPA regulations drive up the cost of energy.
[04:27:54.451 --> 04:28:00.695]  What do you think about paying higher utility bills because of the EPA's new regulations against power plants?
[04:28:00.695 --> 04:28:16.664]  You know, there may be some new regulations coming up against power plants at this point, but unfortunately right now I think that our citizens statewide and nationwide are basically overburdened, especially with today's economic developments and situations that are going on.
[04:28:16.664 --> 04:28:24.049]  I think rate hikes should be at a minimal to at least try to alleviate some of the burden on our taxpayers and our citizens nationwide and statewide.
[04:28:24.324 --> 04:28:28.231]  I know a lot of people that are going to be not only shocked, but a little bit irritated about that as well.
[04:28:28.231 --> 04:28:30.575]  I mean, they're already, I mean, because it's such a hot summer.
[04:28:30.575 --> 04:28:31.316]  Exactly.
[04:28:31.316 --> 04:28:34.081]  You know, everybody's bills is already up through the roof.
[04:28:34.081 --> 04:28:35.263]  You're already paying through the roof.
[04:28:35.640 --> 04:28:44.707]  Because the ACs are running non-stop and then all of a sudden it's like, you know, on top of that and with a downturn economy, yeah, it doesn't seem to jive that well.
[04:28:44.707 --> 04:28:47.149]  Of course I don't want to pay higher utility bills.
[04:28:47.149 --> 04:28:50.571]  They're already extremely high right now as it is.
[04:28:50.571 --> 04:28:54.734]  Well I don't want to pay more because of the carbon dioxide thing.
[04:28:54.734 --> 04:28:55.915]  That doesn't seem right.
[04:28:55.915 --> 04:28:57.737]  Especially if it's not even proven.
[04:28:57.737 --> 04:29:00.419]  Generally I prefer regulations that
[04:29:01.499 --> 04:29:07.040]  That deter pollution, and paying a little bit more for that, than an unregulated environment.
[04:29:07.040 --> 04:29:09.740]  It all has to be regulated some way, right?
[04:29:09.740 --> 04:29:11.861]  It's gonna mess our environment up.
[04:29:11.861 --> 04:29:18.542]  I understand the tax on carbon footprints, but I mean, who's, who's, you know, getting a new Lexus, you know what I mean?
[04:29:18.542 --> 04:29:22.863]  Do you think that carbon dioxide is dangerous?
[04:29:22.863 --> 04:29:27.143]  I think carbon dioxide can be very dangerous.
[04:29:27.143 --> 04:29:29.844]  Okay, what do plants breathe?
[04:29:29.844 --> 04:29:30.804]  Carbon dioxide.
[04:29:32.099 --> 04:29:34.441]  Yeah, I think carbon dioxide is definitely dangerous.
[04:29:34.441 --> 04:29:42.887]  Otherwise, there wouldn't be any rules and laws to prevent it being... What do plants breathe?
[04:29:42.887 --> 04:29:44.148]  Carbon dioxide.
[04:29:44.148 --> 04:29:47.990]  Carbon dioxide is turned into oxygen by plants.
[04:29:47.990 --> 04:29:48.431]  So, I mean...
[04:29:49.952 --> 04:29:51.754]  We're... I mean, it has to be in the world.
[04:29:51.754 --> 04:29:54.616]  Obviously, it's not all dangerous.
[04:29:54.616 --> 04:29:59.500]  Carbon dioxide isn't a dangerous gas, but when there's too much of it, it's a problem.
[04:29:59.500 --> 04:30:09.109]  Carbon dioxide, even though it's a natural gas consumed by plants, it can be dangerous because, well, everyone says it has to do with global warming.
[04:30:09.517 --> 04:30:12.239]  Behind me is the Holly Street Power Plant.
[04:30:12.239 --> 04:30:16.821]  It was partially closed in 2004 and officially shut down in 2007.
[04:30:16.821 --> 04:30:21.924]  Now it's simply a reminder of Austin's energy independence.
[04:30:21.924 --> 04:30:29.269]  What do you think about the fact that General Electric, one of Obama's biggest donors, that they get a waiver and they will not be subject to the regulations?
[04:30:29.269 --> 04:30:31.490]  That sounds like politics and lobbyists' web work.
[04:30:31.490 --> 04:30:33.331]  I mean, it's government, right?
[04:30:33.331 --> 04:30:33.891]  No surprise.
[04:30:33.891 --> 04:30:34.672]  Sounds plausible.
[04:30:34.672 --> 04:30:35.412]  Yeah, it sounds plausible.
[04:30:35.412 --> 04:30:36.313]  There's no surprise about that.
[04:30:36.812 --> 04:30:38.974]  General Electric doesn't need any favors from anybody.
[04:30:38.974 --> 04:30:41.196]  They're a multi-billion dollar corporation.
[04:30:41.196 --> 04:30:49.183]  Are you aware that some of these new regulations are also shutting down power plants and this is causing some of the rolling blackouts throughout Texas?
[04:30:49.183 --> 04:30:50.624]  No, I wasn't familiar with that actually.
[04:30:50.624 --> 04:30:52.406]  I didn't realize that was going on.
[04:30:52.406 --> 04:30:55.268]  Lobbyists make a lot of money striking these deals.
[04:30:55.268 --> 04:30:57.090]  There's a lot of things that we don't know.
[04:30:57.090 --> 04:31:02.114]  And how government, you know, the tax breaks, the incentives, loopholes, you name it.
[04:31:02.114 --> 04:31:03.656]  So I think it's just one more to add to the list.
[04:31:04.824 --> 04:31:13.311]  Well, as you can see, Alex, the people here in Austin, they're aware that their utility rates are going up, but they're not sure of the real cause.
[04:31:13.311 --> 04:31:16.913]  This is Darren McBrain with InfoWars Nightly News.
[04:31:16.913 --> 04:31:20.196]  Waging war on corruption.
[04:31:20.196 --> 04:31:24.299]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[04:31:39.386 --> 04:31:53.532]  I guess that makes me the pot-bellied Santa Claus bringing information warfare weapons to all the little children out there and all the adults as well that want to fight the new world order.
[04:31:53.532 --> 04:31:55.933]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[04:31:55.933 --> 04:32:02.516]  I'm gonna go to Michael, Tommy, Jared, Sanchez, Matt, Jantz, Julio and others that were holding over from the last show.
[04:32:02.516 --> 04:32:05.497]  Then George Norrie scheduled to be on next.
[04:32:05.497 --> 04:32:05.697]  Then
[04:32:06.357 --> 04:32:08.638]  David Icke and the list just goes on and on.
[04:32:08.638 --> 04:32:10.838]  And you just saw some of the nightly news reports.
[04:32:10.838 --> 04:32:11.859]  Darren McBreen has done.
[04:32:11.859 --> 04:32:14.679]  I've got a bunch of reports I filed, reports Aaron filed.
[04:32:14.679 --> 04:32:20.721]  Occasionally we'll play 15 minutes or so of those to give you an idea what we're building, what we're doing here.
[04:32:20.721 --> 04:32:29.324]  If you haven't been a PrisonPlanet.tv viewer, you haven't looked at our YouTube channel, we're now reaching millions of people a week just on the free streams and stuff online.
[04:32:29.324 --> 04:32:33.385]  Our Bilderberg coverage got three and a half million views on justin.tv alone a few months ago.
[04:32:34.145 --> 04:32:35.646]  I'm not counting the radio show.
[04:32:35.646 --> 04:32:36.526]  The radio is great.
[04:32:36.526 --> 04:32:42.050]  It's our regular listeners that know the truth, that are the heart and the core of our operation to reach the rest of the world.
[04:32:42.050 --> 04:32:47.513]  But it's the new people that all of us, listeners and myself, really want to get to.
[04:32:47.513 --> 04:32:52.716]  And that's where your donations at InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com or just go to InfoWars.com.
[04:32:52.716 --> 04:32:55.498]  You can donate there, find the free video and audio streams.
[04:32:56.932 --> 04:32:59.252]  That's where the difference is really being made.
[04:32:59.252 --> 04:33:02.853]  And I see that the donations are really starting to accelerate in.
[04:33:02.853 --> 04:33:07.454]  Normally the peak time is 5 to midnight for donations.
[04:33:07.454 --> 04:33:10.154]  And so if you haven't donated yet, now is the time.
[04:33:10.154 --> 04:33:10.775]  We're trying to hit $500,000.
[04:33:10.775 --> 04:33:13.715]  We've never hit that goal.
[04:33:13.715 --> 04:33:15.455]  We almost hit it last year with $437,000.
[04:33:15.455 --> 04:33:16.496]  And I hired five new people.
[04:33:24.417 --> 04:33:24.597]  Yeah.
[04:33:55.217 --> 04:33:59.939]  If you want to support getting the truth out to an even greater level, who can deny we're the tip of the spear?
[04:33:59.939 --> 04:34:01.540]  And I want to thank all of you that have donated.
[04:34:01.540 --> 04:34:03.761]  We couldn't do this without you.
[04:34:03.761 --> 04:34:06.522]  Let's go ahead and talk to Michael in California.
[04:34:06.522 --> 04:34:08.123]  Thanks for holding.
[04:34:08.123 --> 04:34:09.384]  Mike, Alex, you there?
[04:34:09.384 --> 04:34:09.824]  Yes, sir.
[04:34:09.824 --> 04:34:10.524]  Thank you for calling.
[04:34:10.524 --> 04:34:11.585]  Okay.
[04:34:11.585 --> 04:34:13.025]  Thanks for putting me on.
[04:34:13.025 --> 04:34:17.627]  Thanks for being up for 24 hours for us, trying to get some sleep today.
[04:34:17.627 --> 04:34:19.808]  I want to talk to you about smart meters in the electric companies.
[04:34:22.203 --> 04:34:32.731]  Uh, I was, uh, years ago, long before smart meters, if you don't have enough power usage, they'll come and tap your box without you even knowing.
[04:34:32.731 --> 04:34:34.212]  Are you aware of this?
[04:34:34.212 --> 04:34:37.954]  Well, I know they engage in all forms of chicanery and spying on you.
[04:34:37.954 --> 04:34:41.857]  The systems are spy grids, but elaborate.
[04:34:41.857 --> 04:34:45.719]  Well, I had gone on a vacation and I unplugged my refrigerator.
[04:34:45.719 --> 04:34:48.301]  I unplugged everything in the house.
[04:34:48.301 --> 04:34:49.102]  When I got back,
[04:34:50.108 --> 04:35:00.961]  My landlord said they had basically broke the door down to the utility box room, the power company did, and they thought for sure I was manipulating the system.
[04:35:00.961 --> 04:35:02.263]  They even spiked my power.
[04:35:02.263 --> 04:35:03.645]  I mean, I had no usage, but...
[04:35:04.514 --> 04:35:07.437]  A little bit, but that proves that they spiked it.
[04:35:07.437 --> 04:35:09.280]  So, when I called the power company... Well, there you go.
[04:35:09.280 --> 04:35:11.262]  They're using it for surveillance.
[04:35:11.262 --> 04:35:13.645]  I've seen reports they're using smart meters.
[04:35:13.645 --> 04:35:21.313]  If you're using too much power, then they SWAT Team Raid, and it's an old lady who's obsessed with fish and has, you know, 20 fish tanks.
[04:35:22.254 --> 04:35:27.779]  I mean, it's all part of a surveillance society, the criminal government, along with the criminal corporations.
[04:35:27.779 --> 04:35:30.020]  Of course it's California put this in.
[04:35:30.020 --> 04:35:39.468]  This was all Enron's plan, the same folks that gave us carbon taxes, who used to rape them for a billion dollars a day during the summer, cutting off their power and then jacking up the price.
[04:35:39.468 --> 04:35:41.609]  It's just, we're run by crooks.
[04:35:41.609 --> 04:35:43.291]  And the sooner we figure that out, the better.
[04:35:43.291 --> 04:35:46.573]  Well, actually, that happened in Nevada, of all places.
[04:35:46.573 --> 04:35:50.997]  No, but I'm bringing up California because that's where I've seen the real horror stories you're calling from there.
[04:35:51.855 --> 04:35:55.136]  Oh yeah, oh yeah, and they're doing it here too.
[04:35:55.136 --> 04:36:05.941]  Now the other thing is TSA, I think you might like this story Alex, I was flying home from Europe this year, had to go through DC, don't ever go through that airport.
[04:36:05.941 --> 04:36:09.362]  What a surreal Orwellian place that is, I'm sure you've been there.
[04:36:11.687 --> 04:36:15.329]  You know, I told them that they couldn't touch me.
[04:36:15.329 --> 04:36:17.770]  And they said, then we're going to have to go in the secret room.
[04:36:17.770 --> 04:36:21.692]  Have you had any callers or yourself been in that little weird room they put you in?
[04:36:21.692 --> 04:36:22.832]  Well, I mean, here's the deal.
[04:36:22.832 --> 04:36:24.813]  You know, I've said no to the TSA before.
[04:36:24.813 --> 04:36:28.695]  I've said no at checkpoints and filmed it and been arrested and things like that.
[04:36:28.695 --> 04:36:31.096]  But I had had no sleep in Las Vegas.
[04:36:32.495 --> 04:36:40.739]  And I, they, you know, they've gotten me the Southwest Airlines business class, so I, it was like, oh, I get to go bypass the line.
[04:36:40.739 --> 04:36:44.941]  And so I was late and I come up and I say, I'm not getting the body scanner.
[04:36:44.941 --> 04:36:48.823]  And in a way I wanted to document what the guy was going to do.
[04:36:48.823 --> 04:36:50.925]  And, uh, you know, he proceeded to do the groping.
[04:36:50.925 --> 04:36:55.627]  He didn't grab my genitals because I was gonna, you know, really make an issue out of it.
[04:36:55.627 --> 04:36:58.869]  And I was saying, I do this under protest and I may still do something legally.
[04:36:58.869 --> 04:37:01.070]  But he said, if you prefer, we'll go in the private room.
[04:37:02.304 --> 04:37:03.904]  And was pointing at it.
[04:37:03.904 --> 04:37:06.925]  Uh, and I've, I've, I've reportedly they strip search people in there.
[04:37:06.925 --> 04:37:08.886]  Uh, it's every pervert's dream.
[04:37:08.886 --> 04:37:10.426]  Uh, what happened?
[04:37:10.426 --> 04:37:11.046]  Okay.
[04:37:11.046 --> 04:37:13.467]  What happened was I refused to go through the microwave.
[04:37:13.467 --> 04:37:14.407]  Right.
[04:37:14.407 --> 04:37:20.709]  And what they do, what, what, what they did to me is all of a sudden you can't go through anything.
[04:37:20.709 --> 04:37:25.790]  They make you wait outside the, the, the priest or the, you know, the, the metal detector.
[04:37:25.790 --> 04:37:29.231]  And then all of a sudden they call it a guy who looks like Snoop dog, you know,
[04:37:30.086 --> 04:37:36.410]  Who starts barking orders at you, telling you to take off your belt, even though my belt doesn't have any metal on it.
[04:37:36.410 --> 04:37:37.871]  It's like a traffic stop.
[04:37:37.871 --> 04:37:45.135]  It's a drill sergeant, you're in an arrest situation, here to break your will and train you to be a prisoner.
[04:37:45.135 --> 04:37:49.297]  So finally they get you through there, they make you sit in a chair, at least this is in D.C.
[04:37:49.297 --> 04:37:51.839]  anyway, they make you sit in a chair in front of everybody.
[04:37:52.355 --> 04:37:54.798]  So it's like, you're on stage now.
[04:37:54.798 --> 04:37:57.642]  Well, you're on the torture stage, right?
[04:37:57.642 --> 04:38:06.933]  You're in the town square, in the stockade, basically, there, or the chair.
[04:38:06.933 --> 04:38:09.136]  And they start, you can't do this, you can't do that.
[04:38:09.136 --> 04:38:10.818]  They want to know what your cell phone number is.
[04:38:11.621 --> 04:38:13.982]  And they just start swarming you, right?
[04:38:13.982 --> 04:38:16.423]  You know, here comes the manly woman.
[04:38:16.423 --> 04:38:19.925]  They got the manly woman who comes out and starts barking orders at you.
[04:38:19.925 --> 04:38:22.046]  You know, I told them, you're going to touch me.
[04:38:22.046 --> 04:38:24.847]  You better put on clean gloves, right?
[04:38:24.847 --> 04:38:26.068]  Well, they did that.
[04:38:26.068 --> 04:38:26.708]  And I said, you know what?
[04:38:26.708 --> 04:38:27.569]  You're not going to touch me.
[04:38:27.569 --> 04:38:28.449]  I don't want you to touch me.
[04:38:28.449 --> 04:38:30.470]  They said, you have to go in the private room.
[04:38:30.470 --> 04:38:33.031]  So when you go in there, I'm like, so what?
[04:38:33.031 --> 04:38:35.232]  They're like, all right, well, show it.
[04:38:35.232 --> 04:38:37.173]  You got to take your pants off.
[04:38:37.173 --> 04:38:37.894]  So you know what I did?
[04:38:37.894 --> 04:38:40.255]  I just did a Braveheart style, you know?
[04:38:41.112 --> 04:38:44.977]  I just showed him my rear end, and then showed him my junk, and said, here you go!
[04:38:44.977 --> 04:38:46.959]  This is what you want to see!
[04:38:46.959 --> 04:38:48.681]  Here you go!
[04:38:48.681 --> 04:38:56.431]  Well, you know, it's funny you tell that story, because I happen to know a little bird who reportedly did that too, but, uh, you know, the issue is...
[04:38:59.298 --> 04:39:05.861]  That freaks them out, too, because that's what's coming next, but you're not supposed to be into that phase of humiliation yet.
[04:39:05.861 --> 04:39:08.282]  And that's what the naked body scanners are.
[04:39:08.282 --> 04:39:13.145]  They lie to you and say, oh, we don't record it, they've been caught lying, oh, we're not going to grope kids anymore, they keep doing it.
[04:39:13.145 --> 04:39:14.445]  It's all part of their criminality.
[04:39:14.445 --> 04:39:16.747]  Great job, Michael, good to hear from you.
[04:39:16.747 --> 04:39:18.287]  Tommy in Tennessee, you're on the air.
[04:39:18.287 --> 04:39:20.248]  How you doing?
[04:39:20.248 --> 04:39:21.709]  Good, brother.
[04:39:21.709 --> 04:39:26.871]  First of all, I'd like to say, the boss and I go into a forever agreement for the protection of the crew, you and your family.
[04:39:29.267 --> 04:39:37.951]  Also, I live over here near the Holston Defense and our local news ain't covered and I was wondering if you've heard anything about it.
[04:39:37.951 --> 04:39:43.193]  There's a lot of military activity going on around this area.
[04:39:43.193 --> 04:39:44.813]  Where are you in Tennessee?
[04:39:44.813 --> 04:39:48.335]  In Bristol, near the Holston Mountain.
[04:39:48.335 --> 04:39:54.477]  Well sir, the entire military structure is on total alert.
[04:39:54.477 --> 04:39:58.579]  For a month they've been building up in the Middle East and building up in Kuwait.
[04:39:59.608 --> 04:40:03.869]  And Israel is saying that there's about a 95% chance they're going to strike Iran.
[04:40:03.869 --> 04:40:05.170]  I mean, I covered it earlier.
[04:40:05.170 --> 04:40:06.270]  Did you hear the show earlier?
[04:40:06.270 --> 04:40:08.771]  I mean, I won't blame you if you didn't because it's a long show.
[04:40:08.771 --> 04:40:10.691]  Israel considers preemptive attack on Iran.
[04:40:10.691 --> 04:40:14.992]  Netanyahu goes and asks the Knesset and Cabinet for permission.
[04:40:14.992 --> 04:40:17.573]  That's Fox Television out of Europe.
[04:40:17.573 --> 04:40:17.953]  Sky.
[04:40:17.953 --> 04:40:18.633]  Here's AP.
[04:40:18.633 --> 04:40:19.553]  Same thing.
[04:40:19.553 --> 04:40:20.834]  Israel test fires missiles.
[04:40:20.834 --> 04:40:22.474]  Iran debate rages.
[04:40:22.474 --> 04:40:22.714]  U.S.
[04:40:22.714 --> 04:40:24.695]  troops standing by in Kuwait to back up Israel.
[04:40:25.535 --> 04:40:30.661]  London Guardian, UK military steps up plans for Iran attack amid fresh nuclear affairs.
[04:40:30.661 --> 04:40:35.046]  And this is in a few of our newspapers, but not big news here in the US.
[04:40:35.046 --> 04:40:37.729]  So, yes sir, they are gearing up big time.
[04:40:38.871 --> 04:40:39.771]  Yes, sir.
[04:40:39.771 --> 04:40:50.094]  Also, I heard you last week saying that you were getting letters and stuff about the TSA is not here, you know, with their military checking cars.
[04:40:50.094 --> 04:40:52.294]  That is a lie.
[04:40:52.294 --> 04:40:52.974]  They are here.
[04:40:52.974 --> 04:40:54.035]  Well, they were here.
[04:40:54.035 --> 04:40:55.535]  I hadn't seen them in about a week.
[04:40:55.535 --> 04:40:56.015]  No, sir.
[04:40:56.015 --> 04:40:56.335]  No, sir.
[04:40:56.335 --> 04:40:59.036]  That's COINTELPRO paid disinformation.
[04:40:59.036 --> 04:41:02.077]  They know full well that they're talking about an attack on Iran.
[04:41:02.077 --> 04:41:03.417]  They say I'm just making that up.
[04:41:03.957 --> 04:41:05.499]  You've got a lot of info warriors here.
[04:41:05.499 --> 04:41:07.120]  There's a lot of people in the know here.
[04:41:29.364 --> 04:41:32.927]  You have a lot of people listening to you daily and praying for you.
[04:41:32.927 --> 04:41:33.967]  But, uh, good job.
[04:41:33.967 --> 04:41:34.387]  Thank you.
[04:41:34.387 --> 04:41:36.629]  Well, God bless you, sir, and I appreciate your call.
[04:41:36.629 --> 04:41:38.230]  It's great to hear from you, Tommy.
[04:41:38.230 --> 04:41:40.332]  I know I have a lot of people praying for me.
[04:41:40.332 --> 04:41:55.502]  And that really makes me humble because I know there's so many good men and women out there and so many children that write me letters that are counting on me to do a good job and... You know, the system's just trying to overwhelm us right now.
[04:41:56.783 --> 04:41:57.363]  You really are.
[04:41:57.363 --> 04:42:00.586]  Jared in New Hampshire, you're on the air.
[04:42:00.586 --> 04:42:09.872]  Hey Alex, I had two points before I originally called.
[04:42:09.872 --> 04:42:23.921]  I originally was going to travel to the UK to do a foreign program out there and I went down to the consulate to report, to get my visa and stuff.
[04:42:24.957 --> 04:42:37.166]  And I paid with my debit card, and they, um... And they paid with my... You know, I paid with my debit card, and, uh... They almost didn't want to take it, because it didn't have the chip in it.
[04:42:37.166 --> 04:42:43.771]  But I only paid with the debit card, because, um... Okay.
[04:42:43.771 --> 04:42:51.016]  My bank takes care of the exchange rates.
[04:42:51.016 --> 04:42:51.277]  Okay.
[04:42:53.260 --> 04:42:53.841]  Yeah.
[04:42:53.841 --> 04:42:54.301]  No, no, go ahead.
[04:42:54.301 --> 04:42:56.002]  What's your question?
[04:42:56.002 --> 04:43:01.267]  Have you had anybody, uh, call in and, uh, experience that before?
[04:43:01.267 --> 04:43:05.531]  Because, you know, I felt a little targeted.
[04:43:05.531 --> 04:43:06.972]  Your phone's a little muffled.
[04:43:06.972 --> 04:43:09.554]  Just real clearly, exactly what happened?
[04:43:09.554 --> 04:43:18.281]  I, uh, went down to the consulate to get my visa and I paid with my card and, um,
[04:43:20.123 --> 04:43:26.351]  Yeah, they didn't want to take my card because it didn't have the RFID chip.
[04:43:26.351 --> 04:43:32.439]  Yes, what's happening is banks are announcing dozens of new harassing fees.
[04:43:32.439 --> 04:43:33.680]  You're treated like a criminal.
[04:43:33.680 --> 04:43:36.003]  Every time I go out of town, my cards are turned off.
[04:43:36.890 --> 04:43:42.454]  No matter where I go, and I've got to call and explain who I am, that I did get gas in this town.
[04:43:42.454 --> 04:43:45.136]  I can even go to Dallas, and they turn my cards off.
[04:43:45.136 --> 04:43:47.218]  And it's just all part of this system.
[04:43:47.218 --> 04:43:49.279]  They call it security, but it's total control.
[04:43:49.279 --> 04:43:58.746]  And more and more, they're refusing cash, but also most forms of credit card.
[04:43:58.746 --> 04:44:01.168]  And then they're just going to force us into this cashless system.
[04:44:04.676 --> 04:44:09.306]  Yeah, but like I said, I mean, they want cards with only the RFID chip.
[04:44:09.306 --> 04:44:12.292]  Like, they didn't want to... Like, I had a signature on the back of my card.
[04:44:12.292 --> 04:44:13.074]  It was authentic.
[04:44:15.643 --> 04:44:17.324]  Well, sir, it's all part of the system.
[04:44:17.324 --> 04:44:31.294]  They want the cashless society, and so they can track you, understand and control how to better rape societies, track human activity, destroy underground economies that can keep us alive, shut down our societies, and also taxes and control us at every level.
[04:44:31.294 --> 04:44:32.214]  I appreciate your call.
[04:44:32.214 --> 04:44:34.096]  I know it's terrible, Jared.
[04:44:34.096 --> 04:44:37.018]  Sanchez in California, welcome.
[04:44:37.018 --> 04:44:37.938]  Hey, Alex.
[04:44:37.938 --> 04:44:40.140]  Thank you for taking my call.
[04:44:40.140 --> 04:44:42.061]  I just wanted to go ahead and express how
[04:44:43.757 --> 04:44:44.698]  I'm just angry.
[04:44:44.698 --> 04:44:51.406]  I'm pissed off at what's going on with the media, how it's just not reporting on Ron Paul, reporting on anything.
[04:44:51.406 --> 04:44:52.748]  It's just, it's on.
[04:44:52.748 --> 04:44:53.969]  They're all paid and bought for.
[04:44:54.990 --> 04:44:59.433]  Well, as you know, Sanchez, they've put out two scientific studies as if we need a study.
[04:44:59.433 --> 04:45:00.794]  We've done the math here.
[04:45:00.794 --> 04:45:06.698]  He gets four minutes to speak, then the next person gets eight, and then nine, ten, twelve, fourteen, fifteen minutes.
[04:45:06.698 --> 04:45:08.599]  He gets the least amount of time to speak.
[04:45:08.599 --> 04:45:10.040]  He gets the least amount of attention.
[04:45:10.040 --> 04:45:14.483]  The attention he does get is negative by both parties and all the media.
[04:45:14.483 --> 04:45:14.883]  Why?
[04:45:14.883 --> 04:45:16.084]  Because he's real.
[04:45:16.084 --> 04:45:17.565]  All the rest aren't.
[04:45:17.565 --> 04:45:19.206]  And that's why they're doing this.
[04:45:19.206 --> 04:45:24.390]  And it's another illustration of a guy who knew our problems, knew history, accurately predicted it,
[04:45:25.210 --> 04:45:31.231]  Now, it's all coming down, and the system is scared to let people know about it.
[04:45:31.231 --> 04:45:33.312]  Yeah, no, that's exactly what's happening there.
[04:45:33.312 --> 04:45:33.832]  And you know what?
[04:45:33.832 --> 04:45:36.813]  It makes me think, why don't we do something?
[04:45:36.813 --> 04:45:38.493]  Why don't we make the media report on us?
[04:45:38.493 --> 04:45:41.854]  I mean, they're giving us trash all day long.
[04:45:41.854 --> 04:45:43.054]  Why don't we fight back?
[04:45:43.054 --> 04:45:44.534]  And so I have an idea.
[04:45:44.534 --> 04:45:45.475]  You know what?
[04:45:45.475 --> 04:45:47.155]  I have an idea that I want to hear yours.
[04:45:47.155 --> 04:45:51.176]  We should pick a date, say, two weeks from now.
[04:45:53.127 --> 04:45:53.367]  I don't
[04:46:13.409 --> 04:46:15.710]  I like that, that's good, that's good.
[04:46:15.710 --> 04:46:16.030]  My idea is...
[04:46:40.905 --> 04:46:43.366]  I'm not really that good at explaining.
[04:46:43.366 --> 04:46:45.026]  I'm not as eloquent as you are.
[04:46:45.026 --> 04:46:46.166]  No, I'm not eloquent.
[04:46:46.166 --> 04:46:46.866]  I'm a hillbilly.
[04:46:46.866 --> 04:46:48.567]  Tell me.
[04:46:48.567 --> 04:46:51.247]  Okay, so I watched this documentary.
[04:46:51.247 --> 04:46:53.988]  It's not like a conspiracy one, but it was really good.
[04:46:53.988 --> 04:46:56.729]  And if you haven't seen it, Alex, I recommend that you watch it.
[04:46:56.729 --> 04:46:58.669]  You can watch it on Netflix.
[04:46:58.669 --> 04:46:59.869]  It's really entertaining.
[04:46:59.869 --> 04:47:00.789]  It's really cool.
[04:47:00.789 --> 04:47:03.650]  It's called Exit Through the Gift Shop.
[04:47:03.650 --> 04:47:07.351]  And what it's about, it's about this street artist named Banksy.
[04:47:08.783 --> 04:47:13.367]  And he's probably the most famous street artist in the world, because nobody knows who he is.
[04:47:13.367 --> 04:47:17.031]  He's kind of like the Robin Hood of this underground world of street art.
[04:47:17.031 --> 04:47:19.973]  And his documentary kind of covers a little bit of that.
[04:47:19.973 --> 04:47:24.518]  And it's just a real interesting way that it's made.
[04:47:24.518 --> 04:47:34.467]  But it's kind of, it has like a twist in the middle of it, where it shows you how easy the masses of people can be manipulated, or in a sense brainwashed,
[04:47:34.943 --> 04:47:35.964]  We're good to go.
[04:47:55.091 --> 04:47:56.892]  In my opinion, it wasn't that great.
[04:47:56.892 --> 04:47:58.213]  But it's just a really interesting film.
[04:47:58.213 --> 04:48:08.479]  The reason why I bring this movie up is because there's another very famous street artist in this documentary, and he said something that was really, I think, is key.
[04:48:08.479 --> 04:48:09.420]  I think it's very important.
[04:48:09.420 --> 04:48:11.421]  I think you should all hear it.
[04:48:11.421 --> 04:48:16.204]  And this guy who said this was, his name is Shepard Fairey.
[04:48:16.204 --> 04:48:20.507]  And Shepard Fairey is the guy who created the Andre the Giant.
[04:48:20.507 --> 04:48:24.049]  Yeah, he created the Obey Stuff, the Obama iconic image, sure.
[04:48:24.830 --> 04:48:37.862]  Yeah, yeah, my ball, a ball thing, and, um, anyway, he was in the documentary, and he, uh... No, the power of tagging things, uh, they've... I'm not gonna get into it.
[04:48:37.862 --> 04:48:44.308]  The point is, yes, this show could launch a national tagging program that would really hurt the globalists.
[04:48:44.887 --> 04:48:50.849]  I'm not necessarily saying that, Alex, but what I'm saying is... Well, no, no, but I've never done that.
[04:48:50.849 --> 04:49:03.434]  I told people to hang the Obama poster in legal and lawful areas, and still they festooned them all over, you know, stuff that was kind of uncivil, but then they were selectively enforced against, and then that made it even bigger news.
[04:49:03.434 --> 04:49:06.615]  So, so briefly, because I want to hear this, what is your idea then?
[04:49:06.615 --> 04:49:09.696]  People could paint their own barns, their own cars.
[04:49:09.696 --> 04:49:13.918]  I've seen people doing Ron Paul or Infowars.com cars.
[04:49:13.918 --> 04:49:14.518]  People could...
[04:49:14.938 --> 04:49:17.960]  I mean, what are your ideas to really grab people?
[04:49:17.960 --> 04:49:19.901]  I'm trying to explain as best I can.
[04:49:19.901 --> 04:49:24.923]  This guy, he said in regards to talking about his obeying, this is what he's really known for.
[04:49:24.923 --> 04:49:31.827]  He was talking about it and he said that when he was doing it, he just started it out as an inside joke between him and his buddies.
[04:49:31.827 --> 04:49:34.488]  And he was just doing it for fun, going out at night.
[04:49:34.488 --> 04:49:40.691]  And yeah, he was putting this stuff illegally up on like walls, stickers and stencils and stuff like this.
[04:49:40.691 --> 04:49:42.012]  And on billboards.
[04:49:42.012 --> 04:49:43.213]  Of course, he's doing it illegally, but
[04:49:44.480 --> 04:49:50.927]  Just, if you flash forward years later, like, this guy's made an industry of it, now obeys, like, a clothing line.
[04:49:51.414 --> 04:49:53.155]  People all over the world are wearing Obey T-shirts.
[04:49:53.155 --> 04:49:54.496]  I have a bunch of them.
[04:49:54.496 --> 04:49:56.277]  And one thing he said is that... Yeah, I know.
[04:49:56.277 --> 04:50:00.219]  And he claimed he was a guy that was anti-commercialism.
[04:50:00.219 --> 04:50:04.381]  And so, you're talking about creating some type of Ron Paul movement like that.
[04:50:04.381 --> 04:50:07.122]  Certainly, the Ron Paul movement is a hundred times bigger than Shepard Fairey.
[04:50:07.122 --> 04:50:07.983]  He's more of a leftist.
[04:50:07.983 --> 04:50:11.905]  But I do understand taking kind of that model and doing that.
[04:50:11.905 --> 04:50:13.646]  That's what we did with the Obama poster.
[04:50:13.646 --> 04:50:15.667]  I want to show people right here, and I appreciate your call.
[04:50:15.667 --> 04:50:17.428]  Was that the basic idea, Sanchez?
[04:50:18.308 --> 04:50:19.369]  Yeah, that was the best idea.
[04:50:19.369 --> 04:50:24.893]  I was thinking since he did something on tariffs, we all have at least one image that we could all have at the same time.
[04:50:24.893 --> 04:50:27.035]  Because that's just one guy that did that.
[04:50:27.035 --> 04:50:31.559]  And imagine if just half of your listeners, or even like a quarter of your listeners, were to do that.
[04:50:31.559 --> 04:50:39.185]  Yeah, we could have an image of Obama as a ghoul and put under him, murder prize winner.
[04:50:39.185 --> 04:50:40.366]  Or murderer.
[04:50:40.366 --> 04:50:42.567]  And then when people say, why are you calling him a murderer?
[04:50:42.567 --> 04:50:44.869]  We say, well he's the peace prize winner.
[04:50:44.869 --> 04:50:46.371]  He's for torture and all these wars.
[04:50:47.471 --> 04:50:48.151]  And you know what?
[04:50:48.151 --> 04:50:48.892]  I think you're right.
[04:50:48.892 --> 04:50:50.392]  I think we'll come up... Well, Ron Paul!
[04:50:50.392 --> 04:50:51.313]  Alex, what about Ron Paul?
[04:50:51.313 --> 04:50:53.134]  What do we do with an image of Ron Paul?
[04:50:53.134 --> 04:50:56.575]  Some kind of universal one that you guys can make the art for.
[04:50:56.575 --> 04:50:58.636]  And then it could say, you know, not a puppet.
[04:50:58.636 --> 04:51:00.377]  Or it could say, our last chance.
[04:51:00.377 --> 04:51:04.278]  And just everybody, all the Info Warriors at the same time, put that out everywhere.
[04:51:04.278 --> 04:51:07.299]  Because there's so many people that don't even know who this guy is, Ron Paul.
[04:51:07.299 --> 04:51:09.120]  No, I agree.
[04:51:09.120 --> 04:51:09.721]  That's a good idea.
[04:51:09.721 --> 04:51:10.741]  Not a puppet.
[04:51:10.741 --> 04:51:11.381]  They fear him.
[04:51:11.381 --> 04:51:11.981]  You know what?
[04:51:11.981 --> 04:51:12.722]  I will launch
[04:51:13.749 --> 04:51:25.973]  Next week, I'll get my graphics folks to put it together, we'll launch an iconic image of Ron Paul, his face, with a simple slogan on it, it's a genius idea, God bless you.
[04:51:25.973 --> 04:51:32.275]  By the way, speaking of getting the word out, $5.95 for a 25 pack of my bumper stickers at cost.
[04:51:32.975 --> 04:51:38.299]  The Infowars.com sticker, the end the Fed, arrest the bankers, Infowars.com sticker.
[04:51:38.299 --> 04:51:40.841]  The fluoride, there's poison in the tap water sticker.
[04:51:40.841 --> 04:51:42.422]  This has made the news around, that one.
[04:51:42.422 --> 04:51:44.684]  9-11 was an inside job.
[04:51:44.684 --> 04:51:46.065]  Right there!
[04:51:46.065 --> 04:51:47.526]  Right there, these stickers.
[04:51:47.526 --> 04:51:49.508]  25 of them for $5.95.
[04:51:49.508 --> 04:51:51.129]  That is at our cost.
[04:51:51.129 --> 04:51:52.850]  Infowars.com.
[04:51:52.850 --> 04:51:54.031]  We buy these 20,000 at a pop.
[04:51:59.494 --> 04:52:02.655]  Okay, Sanchez made some great points.
[04:52:02.655 --> 04:52:05.756]  I want to get to Matt, Lance, Julio, Tina, Zach.
[04:52:05.756 --> 04:52:09.998]  I can't tell who was holding when the last hour ended and who's new here.
[04:52:09.998 --> 04:52:13.279]  I got George Norrie coming up here in a few minutes.
[04:52:13.279 --> 04:52:15.459]  But I will continue with your calls.
[04:52:15.459 --> 04:52:21.041]  I'm going to go ahead and go to a couple more short little pieces.
[04:52:21.041 --> 04:52:22.882]  Whatever ones we haven't played, Jaren, be my guest.
[04:52:24.193 --> 04:52:31.117]  We're gonna play the Facebook one, and we can also play the Denver Airport and the Hop Daddy's one about the fluoride stuff if you want.
[04:52:31.117 --> 04:52:34.098]  So yeah, play whatever you want while we're getting George and Ori on the line.
[04:52:34.098 --> 04:52:39.881]  And then we'll talk to George for 30 minutes, then we'll go back to your calls, and then David Icke's coming up, and a bunch more.
[04:52:39.881 --> 04:52:44.743]  We're broadcasting, if you just tuned in, and we're watching for 27 hours straight.
[04:52:44.743 --> 04:52:49.106]  And we are now into almost the end of hour number 5.
[04:52:50.703 --> 04:52:58.447]  And I'm going to go until a little bit past five o'clock, when my first real break, Mike Adams is going to be in there for a couple hours.
[04:52:58.447 --> 04:53:06.812]  And then he's got a bunch of guests lined up and information, your calls and news, a bunch of breaking stuff about evil raw milk criminals that need to be arrested for drinking it now.
[04:53:06.812 --> 04:53:12.215]  So that's coming up and we'll get into all the other people, Alfred Adash, Tex Mars,
[04:53:15.799 --> 04:53:25.100]  Mr. Corbett of the Corbett Report, Springmeyer's coming on, Aaron Dykes, Paul Watson, Richard Reeves, Gerald Cilente, Jim Mars, Chapman, it's all coming up.
[04:53:26.645 --> 04:53:27.686]  And we will continue here.
[04:53:27.686 --> 04:53:28.467]  Why are we doing this?
[04:53:28.467 --> 04:53:34.492]  Well, it's fun to do a 24-hour plus broadcast sometimes, but it's also fun and informative to have a money bomb.
[04:53:34.492 --> 04:53:43.900]  The idea of people that are against the globalists giving money to an organization, to a media outlet, to build a bigger structure, more equipment, more crew, to up the level.
[04:53:43.900 --> 04:53:45.922]  Look at how we've grown in four years.
[04:53:45.922 --> 04:53:46.762]  Who can deny it?
[04:53:47.603 --> 04:53:49.404]  We're routinely linked on Drudge Report.
[04:53:49.404 --> 04:53:52.326]  They have all these national TV hit pieces on it.
[04:53:52.326 --> 04:53:55.328]  InfoWars and Prison Planet have more than tripled their audiences.
[04:53:55.328 --> 04:53:56.869]  The films are viral.
[04:53:56.869 --> 04:54:00.012]  Everything we do is just bam, bam, bam, breaking through.
[04:54:00.012 --> 04:54:05.055]  And it's all because of you supporting us and spreading the word and my hard work and the crew's hard work and dedication.
[04:54:05.055 --> 04:54:07.777]  So, InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[04:54:07.777 --> 04:54:08.858]  I know it's well over $100,000, but I'll tell you,
[04:54:10.979 --> 04:54:12.580]  We've usually launched these a month before.
[04:54:12.580 --> 04:54:13.340]  You know, get the website up.
[04:54:13.340 --> 04:54:14.881]  We did this 15 days before.
[04:54:14.881 --> 04:54:16.162]  I didn't promote it like I normally do.
[04:54:16.162 --> 04:54:17.903]  The economy is in a tailspin.
[04:54:17.903 --> 04:54:23.746]  We've normally raised $100,000 by the time that we even kicked the money bomb off in the month before.
[04:54:23.746 --> 04:54:24.807]  I like to get started.
[04:54:24.807 --> 04:54:30.169]  We've now raised, at that point, we need to get to the $500,000 or at least the respectable $400,000 and something.
[04:54:30.169 --> 04:54:31.450]  You know, we've supported Ron Paul.
[04:54:31.450 --> 04:54:32.991]  We've supported all these other groups.
[04:54:32.991 --> 04:54:40.095]  Ron Paul said four years ago that half his additional money, initial money, when he first ran for president came from this, from audience of this show telling him so.
[04:54:40.855 --> 04:54:43.636]  And that was the numbers and things they had from their feedback.
[04:54:43.636 --> 04:54:46.236]  Asking folks how they found the Paul campaign, why they donated.
[04:54:46.236 --> 04:54:51.937]  This is such an important platform, not just for myself and the callers, but for the guest.
[04:54:51.937 --> 04:54:53.337]  And that's why it's so important.
[04:54:53.337 --> 04:54:58.418]  So donate today at InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com or buy books, videos, bumper stickers to support us.
[04:54:58.418 --> 04:55:03.379]  A lot of these deals now, actually we don't make any money, but it does get the website out and educate people.
[04:55:03.379 --> 04:55:05.499]  And that's what I really care about at the end of the day.
[04:55:05.499 --> 04:55:08.120]  So InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[04:55:08.120 --> 04:55:09.340]  We also have the eBay area.
[04:55:10.040 --> 04:55:17.964]  When Mike Adams fills in for a couple hours, I'm going to go back there and paint and do some work and do some original stuff for the eBay deal.
[04:55:17.964 --> 04:55:20.686]  Some paintings and some pen and inks for folks that donate as well.
[04:55:20.686 --> 04:55:21.986]  Those will be auctioned off at eBay.
[04:55:21.986 --> 04:55:26.189]  I got the bullhorn being auctioned up there and the sledgehammer and a lot more.
[04:55:26.949 --> 04:55:28.771]  It's all at InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[04:55:28.771 --> 04:55:37.980]  The free video streams, the audio streams, all of it, the donation buttons, InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com, or if that site gets sluggish as it does sometimes, simply go to InfoWars.com.
[04:55:37.980 --> 04:55:40.122]  You can find it all duplicated right there.
[04:55:40.122 --> 04:55:45.067]  We'll be back after a couple more clips of the nightly news made possible by your support.
[04:55:45.067 --> 04:55:45.408]  Here it is.
[04:55:46.877 --> 04:55:53.140]  Recently, as a reporter for InfoWars, I tried to log back into Facebook and it wouldn't let me.
[04:55:53.140 --> 04:56:00.943]  It wanted me to identify myself not with my passcode, but by showing me obscure pictures of my friends and family.
[04:56:00.943 --> 04:56:05.565]  I had the feeling that it had something to do with testing their face recognition technology.
[04:56:05.565 --> 04:56:08.447]  And then I saw this article in the Wall Street Journal.
[04:56:09.332 --> 04:56:16.754]  We know governments are quietly using face scanning cameras on street corners and in airports, and they have license plate scanners.
[04:56:16.754 --> 04:56:21.456]  But how are they going to get the public to openly accept a surveillance society?
[04:56:21.456 --> 04:56:31.999]  Well, Facebook recently teamed up with CBS to promote their new fall drama, Person of Interest, to condition people to opt in to their face recognition program.
[04:56:31.999 --> 04:56:37.701]  They know who these people are and what their names are, and they want you to confirm it for them.
[04:56:37.961 --> 04:56:44.865]  Sure, the security measure confirms who I am, but it also confirms for them who my friends and family are.
[04:56:44.865 --> 04:56:48.848]  So I went out to the street to find out what people had to say about all this.
[04:56:48.848 --> 04:56:57.954]  I tried to log on from a different computer that I never used before and Facebook prompted me to say, look, we want you to go through a series of face recognition.
[04:56:57.954 --> 04:57:01.356]  Yeah, the questions and like showing you the pictures of your friends and stuff.
[04:57:03.985 --> 04:57:06.707]  Yeah, yeah.
[04:57:06.707 --> 04:57:12.951]  I guess it's just a privacy and more of a protective measure because I know people's accounts get hacked a lot.
[04:57:12.951 --> 04:57:17.374]  So maybe they're trying to actually help us out by giving us a little quiz.
[04:57:17.374 --> 04:57:20.797]  I think I remember talking about where they show you pictures and it's like, oh, is this this person?
[04:57:20.797 --> 04:57:22.358]  And you're supposed to confirm it.
[04:57:22.358 --> 04:57:24.920]  Yeah, I think that's really weird.
[04:57:24.920 --> 04:57:30.844]  I know it's used as a tool just to make it easier to tag people, but I've never heard of it being used to get you to get back into your page.
[04:57:31.104 --> 04:57:39.975]  Do you feel comfortable with the fact that Facebook is data mining all your personal, private information, including, you know, your friends' and family's activities?
[04:57:39.975 --> 04:57:46.543]  I mean, I can't say that that's comfortable, but I think anything that you put up on the Internet is up for public scrutiny.
[04:57:46.543 --> 04:57:47.965]  I'm not comfortable with that at all.
[04:57:49.761 --> 04:57:56.410]  Although I know they're doing it, and I wonder exactly what they're doing with all the information.
[04:57:56.410 --> 04:58:02.338]  The government agencies realize that it's a good way to pick up on things that they don't like or especially illicit activities.
[04:58:02.338 --> 04:58:06.865]  You should keep your settings on private and you should be careful with what you post on there.
[04:58:07.265 --> 04:58:11.388]  It's easier to monitor people on Facebook than it is to tap people's phones, I think, to a certain degree.
[04:58:11.388 --> 04:58:15.111]  Anything you put up on the public sphere, I think, is essentially public information.
[04:58:15.111 --> 04:58:24.999]  Just with the internet in general, we are getting more used to, like, our business being out there and just getting used to, I guess, our privacy diminishing a little bit.
[04:58:24.999 --> 04:58:28.122]  I'm just not gonna be very informative on Facebook anymore.
[04:58:28.122 --> 04:58:30.684]  No.
[04:58:30.684 --> 04:58:31.805]  Untag myself from every
[04:58:32.193 --> 04:58:32.433]  Absolutely.
[04:58:32.433 --> 04:58:37.135]  I definitely think that while it might not be intentionally so, it could be intentionally so, but it's definitely serving as that.
[04:58:37.135 --> 04:58:41.077]  I think it is getting us acclimated to a surveillance world.
[04:58:41.077 --> 04:58:42.858]  That sounds a bit 1984 and creepy.
[04:59:01.772 --> 04:59:09.539]  People are getting really used to sharing all kinds of information, putting everything about their entire life online.
[04:59:09.539 --> 04:59:15.384]  We're putting a lot of information in a public sphere, and that information is accessible to anyone.
[04:59:15.384 --> 04:59:17.106]  I think it's definitely acclimating people.
[04:59:17.526 --> 04:59:25.532]  Who knows if that could be used for good to hold us to a higher standard or for something else.
[04:59:25.532 --> 04:59:27.313]  It's really about what we do with it.
[04:59:27.313 --> 04:59:33.437]  I personally love Facebook and it's just a way for me to keep in contact with my friends who live all over the world.
[04:59:33.437 --> 04:59:40.663]  And for anyone to use that for keeping track of people, I think that's just really creepy actually.
[04:59:41.743 --> 04:59:43.125]  I don't feel comfortable with that.
[04:59:43.125 --> 04:59:44.246]  It's incredible.
[04:59:44.246 --> 04:59:50.592]  Internet kill switches, cyber security, the takeover of the web, warrantless wiretapping.
[04:59:50.592 --> 04:59:56.579]  This is America 10 years after 9-11 and it has nothing to do with keeping us safe.
[04:59:57.199 --> 05:00:03.141]  Zuckerman, the owner of Facebook, insultingly called his own users dumb F's.
[05:00:03.141 --> 05:00:10.323]  But worst of all, once you've posted your photos and your personal data on Facebook, they say they own it forever.
[05:00:10.323 --> 05:00:13.625]  You can make your account private, but it's always there.
[05:00:13.625 --> 05:00:14.925]  They're using it.
[05:00:14.925 --> 05:00:20.567]  Social networks like Twitter, Facebook, and all of it, they have deep government ties.
[05:00:20.567 --> 05:00:26.029]  Google was set up with funding from In-Q-Tel, a company whose main client is the CIA.
[05:00:27.483 --> 05:00:34.750]  As Wayne Madsen reports, the CIA has always used the popular media of the day to push their propaganda.
[05:00:34.750 --> 05:00:39.435]  And today we see Facebook expanding their face recognition capabilities.
[05:00:39.435 --> 05:00:42.558]  I'm Darren McBreen for InfoWars Nightly News.
[05:00:42.558 --> 05:00:43.499]  Alex, back to you.
