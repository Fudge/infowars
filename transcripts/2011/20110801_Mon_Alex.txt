[00:00:05.646 --> 00:00:09.849]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:11.291]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.071 --> 00:00:12.972]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.613 --> 00:00:17.256]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.816 --> 00:00:21.919]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.507 --> 00:00:33.189]  We are live, my friends!
[00:00:34.738 --> 00:00:35.672]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:38.163 --> 00:00:46.946]  It is, of course, the first day of August 2011, and we're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:47.386 --> 00:01:04.752]  We have Lyndon LaRouche joining us via video and audio connection from Virginia coming up in the second hour, and we will open the phones up in the second half of the interview with Lyndon LaRouche on the economy and what's happening geopolitically and worldwide.
[00:01:05.532 --> 00:01:11.274]  We'll also get his take on the whole debt ceiling fracas that is ongoing.
[00:01:12.794 --> 00:01:16.936]  I want to air a special report today.
[00:01:17.056 --> 00:01:22.038]  In fact, we're going to do that coming up in the next segment.
[00:01:23.658 --> 00:01:28.960]  Exclusive ATF intimidates gun owners with home visits.
[00:01:31.301 --> 00:01:41.791]  And if you are a radio listener and not a PrisonPlanet.tv viewer, we do have the video report posted at Infowars.com.
[00:01:41.831 --> 00:01:47.856]  And I'm asking everybody to get this report out to your friends, your family, your neighbors.
[00:01:48.277 --> 00:01:52.701]  This is Obama launching a massive gun grab by stealth.
[00:01:52.801 --> 00:01:56.605]  And the headline for the video is, Obama launches gun grab.
[00:01:57.423 --> 00:02:01.847]  And it is, again, posted on the front page of InfoWars.com.
[00:02:01.867 --> 00:02:11.714]  We're going to lead with that when we come back from break, and then I'm going to get into the economy, stock slide after week, manufacturing news.
[00:02:13.123 --> 00:02:14.184]  Monday look ahead.
[00:02:14.564 --> 00:02:17.586]  Debt deal rally could be short-lived.
[00:02:18.106 --> 00:02:20.788]  Dow tumbles on weak manufacturing report.
[00:02:21.428 --> 00:02:24.790]  Middle classes to be hit by tax increase by the back door.
[00:02:24.971 --> 00:02:34.437]  Obama and Boehner face furious backlash from their own parties as last-minute debt deal is slammed as a fudge or a lie.
[00:02:36.025 --> 00:02:41.873]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, of course, former head of policy at the Treasury Department under Reagan, said, Will the ceiling fall in?
[00:02:41.893 --> 00:02:44.717]  Disastrous outcomes of an orchestrated crisis.
[00:02:44.737 --> 00:02:46.699]  We'll be going over some of that report.
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.485]  Jim Cramer accuses Obama of creating tremendous fear and panic.
[00:02:50.845 --> 00:02:54.227]  Yeah, but it doesn't matter if that made Obama's approval rating fall even faster.
[00:02:54.627 --> 00:02:57.009]  It's his job to destroy confidence.
[00:02:57.509 --> 00:03:02.692]  It's his job to bring in carbon taxes and put a further wet blanket on a faltering economy.
[00:03:02.932 --> 00:03:05.014]  They want to implode it to consolidate it.
[00:03:05.434 --> 00:03:10.557]  How many globalist CFR white papers do you have to see to understand that?
[00:03:10.797 --> 00:03:12.738]  People say, why are they doing things that hurt the economy?
[00:03:13.078 --> 00:03:14.759]  They know raising taxes hurts the economy.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.801]  They know it means less tax receipts come in.
[00:03:17.401 --> 00:03:20.822]  In every case, you raise taxes, less money comes in.
[00:03:21.362 --> 00:03:22.743]  People are like, what?
[00:03:23.083 --> 00:03:23.963]  You didn't know history?
[00:03:24.544 --> 00:03:31.606]  When you cut taxes, people spend it in the economy, and the economy speeds up, and then more overall revenue comes in.
[00:03:31.986 --> 00:03:34.607]  You cut a little, you get some growth.
[00:03:34.647 --> 00:03:36.168]  You cut a lot, you get a ton of growth.
[00:03:36.208 --> 00:03:39.349]  You cut massively, you get gigantic growth.
[00:03:40.149 --> 00:03:45.771]  And so, the economy speeds up, so much more money is invested and spent, that tax
[00:03:47.253 --> 00:03:48.333]  Revenues increase.
[00:03:49.333 --> 00:03:58.155]  That's why the only states that have lower taxes, like Texas and a few others, are actually growing when the rest of the country is going into a depression.
[00:03:58.215 --> 00:04:02.756]  Because we're not perfect and we got high taxes here, but compared to everywhere else, they're low.
[00:04:04.356 --> 00:04:05.557]  That's one of the few things the U.S.
[00:04:05.577 --> 00:04:06.557]  still has going for it.
[00:04:06.617 --> 00:04:09.938]  As high as our taxes are, it's lower than many other areas of the world.
[00:04:10.378 --> 00:04:12.338]  Western Europe, Japan, places like that.
[00:04:13.098 --> 00:04:16.739]  And so there is still some investment here, even though we've been basically de-industrialized.
[00:04:17.795 --> 00:04:25.635]  uh... but you put more taxes on it and and and quote create global standardization of taxes which the UN OECD
[00:04:27.287 --> 00:04:31.769]  Organization of Economic Cooperative Development and others are always calling for, they call the U.S.
[00:04:31.829 --> 00:04:33.109]  a tax haven.
[00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:41.352]  Because, you know, on average, the average person only pays about 60% in taxes, quote, wealthy people around 70% or higher.
[00:04:41.932 --> 00:04:45.273]  And in many areas of Europe, you're paying upwards of 80 or more.
[00:04:45.613 --> 00:04:47.614]  So they're trying to get us to that point.
[00:04:47.934 --> 00:04:55.156]  But this key report on the gun grabbing coming up first, and then we're going to get into just masses of key news today.
[00:04:55.236 --> 00:04:56.337]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:04:57.097 --> 00:05:00.078]  I'm Alex Jones, this is the Genesis Network, GCNLive.com.
[00:05:02.058 --> 00:05:03.559]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:08.800]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.441]  Saving means to make money.
[00:05:10.601 --> 00:05:19.383]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:05:20.123 --> 00:05:27.248]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:05:27.668 --> 00:05:35.273]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:05:35.673 --> 00:05:40.596]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[00:06:04.835 --> 00:06:05.736]  Tyranny is here.
[00:06:06.097 --> 00:06:09.801]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:06:09.961 --> 00:06:12.243]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:06:12.263 --> 00:06:17.709]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:24.357]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:06:24.777 --> 00:06:30.319]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:34.441]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:06:34.941 --> 00:06:38.942]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:06:39.222 --> 00:06:44.744]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:06:45.165 --> 00:06:48.146]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:06:48.726 --> 00:06:50.146]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:06:50.707 --> 00:06:51.127]  It's here.

[00:08:10.609 --> 00:08:11.430]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.191 --> 00:08:13.052]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.732 --> 00:08:17.396]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.936 --> 00:08:22.060]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:23.641 --> 00:08:28.045]  It is Monday, the first day of August, kicking off the new month.
[00:08:29.453 --> 00:08:29.954]  11 a.m.
[00:08:30.274 --> 00:08:32.556]  and 8 minutes Central Standard Time.
[00:08:32.676 --> 00:08:33.717]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:08:34.517 --> 00:08:43.925]  We have Lyndon LaRouche, who really needs no introduction, joining us to give us his take on the economy, the debt ceiling, the geopolitical ramifications of what's happening.
[00:08:43.945 --> 00:08:48.608]  We'll also look at the latest developments in Libya, Syria,
[00:08:49.995 --> 00:08:55.638]  I ran that is all coming up later in the second hour today.
[00:08:55.758 --> 00:08:58.819]  We will also open the phones up at the bottom of the hour here.
[00:08:58.879 --> 00:09:04.302]  But first I want to get into this special report dealing with a stealth attack on the Second Amendment in just a moment.
[00:09:04.842 --> 00:09:08.764]  Then we're going to get into middle class to be hit by tax increase by the back door.
[00:09:09.224 --> 00:09:11.846]  Obama and Boehner face furious backlash.
[00:09:12.426 --> 00:09:18.849]  from their own parties as last-minute debt deal is slammed as a lie or as a fudge.
[00:09:19.349 --> 00:09:23.791]  Also, world warns of disaster if no debt deal is done.
[00:09:23.811 --> 00:09:26.472]  We're being warned that the bankers are our masters.
[00:09:27.512 --> 00:09:40.878]  Also, UK police tell public to report any type of government criticism that's anti-government and they say connected to terrorism and the Prime Minister over
[00:09:42.685 --> 00:10:01.732]  Ian Norway is also telling political rivals that we're gaining in the polls with the upcoming election in Parliament not to criticize the illegals, the legals, the giant populations that the government's bringing in to play off against the domestic Norwegians in the aftermath of the shooting.
[00:10:01.753 --> 00:10:04.253]  They're saying we may just ban free speech in Norway.
[00:10:04.293 --> 00:10:04.854]  We may just
[00:10:05.814 --> 00:10:07.955]  Not allow you to criticize these people.
[00:10:08.235 --> 00:10:12.358]  But first, I want to get to this report that will take us out to break.
[00:10:12.378 --> 00:10:14.138]  Then we'll come back and get into all that news.
[00:10:14.739 --> 00:10:18.601]  Exclusive ATF intimidates gun owners with home visits.
[00:10:19.041 --> 00:10:25.905]  And the video is posted at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com titled, Obama Launches Gun Grab.
[00:10:26.545 --> 00:10:39.354]  And he said that if this works out, doing things outside of law, outside of Congress, that they are going to launch more executive orders and things to restrict the Second Amendment and put people on a no-gun-by list.
[00:10:39.975 --> 00:10:50.622]  Even if you have no criminal record, the White House will decide and then shut down your right to keep and bear arms, as the former Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel called for a few years ago.
[00:10:50.883 --> 00:10:51.923]  Here is this key report.
[00:10:51.943 --> 00:10:52.744]  Get it out to everybody.
[00:11:03.095 --> 00:11:05.817]  And again, we're going- No one will be able to be armed.
[00:11:06.057 --> 00:11:07.038]  We will take all weapons.
[00:11:07.699 --> 00:11:12.603]  The police and National Guard going street by street, entering open houses with guns drawn.
[00:11:12.623 --> 00:11:16.245]  And instructions to disarm anyone inside.
[00:11:16.626 --> 00:11:18.567]  Or anyone who has studied history.
[00:11:18.928 --> 00:11:19.668]  It's very clear.
[00:11:20.489 --> 00:11:24.372]  Tyrants do not want armed slaves.
[00:11:25.313 --> 00:11:27.374]  Slaves are disarmed.
[00:11:27.434 --> 00:11:31.818]  As the bumper sticker reads, politicians love disarmed peasants.
[00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:40.442]  The first gun control laws in this country were against newly emancipated freed slaves at the end of the Civil War.
[00:11:42.082 --> 00:11:43.883]  We've seen a lot of federal power grabs.
[00:11:43.923 --> 00:11:49.585]  We've seen Obama launch wars in Libya without congressional approval and levy carbon taxes without Congress.
[00:11:50.965 --> 00:11:54.706]  We've seen the power of the bureaucracy grow unchecked.
[00:11:55.865 --> 00:12:05.212]  But today, I want to talk to you about one of the most brazen and shocking examples of this I have ever seen.
[00:12:05.873 --> 00:12:11.958]  No, I'm not talking about the internet kill switch they've put in place or calls restrict free speech that are public.
[00:12:13.138 --> 00:12:14.319]  No, I'm not talking about that.
[00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:23.687]  I'm talking about the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Farms, and Explosives announcing
[00:12:24.929 --> 00:12:44.257]  To Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California, outside of law, with no law, that when a gun dealer sells two or more rifles to someone, they've got to file a suspicious activities report with the ATF.
[00:12:45.882 --> 00:12:55.906]  Now remember, when you get those guns, there's an instant check done with the FBI, where your background check is run, and on the form, what you're buying and what you're doing is all filled out.
[00:12:56.366 --> 00:12:57.867]  And that's under federal law.
[00:12:58.267 --> 00:13:00.848]  Albeit unconstitutional, it's still law.
[00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:13.854]  What the ATF announced months ago was, well, we're getting a law passed by Congress, and they introduced a bill, the Democrats did, where when you buy two or more rifles,
[00:13:15.117 --> 00:13:22.002]  You have to report it and fill out a suspicious activity report on the person to the ATF.
[00:13:22.603 --> 00:13:32.950]  The rule that was put in place to report on rifles that are being, long guns that are being sold was also, they testified, very helpful.
[00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:37.193]  The demand letter reporting the multiple sale of those rifles would be helpful for us, yes.
[00:13:38.803 --> 00:13:42.225]  Is there any other tool that this Congress could give you?
[00:13:42.406 --> 00:13:43.446]  Well, guess what happened?
[00:13:44.087 --> 00:13:45.968]  Congress didn't pass that law.
[00:13:47.289 --> 00:13:50.671]  And so Obama said, who needs Congress?
[00:13:51.912 --> 00:14:01.559]  And he sent letters on July 12th to every federal firearms licensee or seller in those four states.
[00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:06.714]  He sent them letters and said, you will now report.
[00:14:06.774 --> 00:14:08.876]  You are ordered, you are commanded.
[00:14:09.297 --> 00:14:14.502]  And I have a copy of the letter given to me by a good friend who owns a gun shop here in Austin, Texas.
[00:14:15.803 --> 00:14:18.746]  And they have no law authorizing this.
[00:14:18.986 --> 00:14:19.827]  And when my friend
[00:14:20.919 --> 00:14:26.643]  There's a gun dealer called the ATF and talked to Daniel Jones, the head of the ATF here in Austin.
[00:14:27.503 --> 00:14:34.108]  He called him two weeks before this letter came out because it was in the news that the ATF was already ordering gun shops to do this without law.
[00:14:34.828 --> 00:14:36.909]  And he said, do I have to do this to Daniel Jones?
[00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:43.894]  And Daniel said, no, the bill has failed in Congress and obviously we can't enforce something if it's not the law.
[00:14:44.314 --> 00:14:45.395]  So don't worry about it.
[00:14:47.016 --> 00:14:49.658]  Well, a few weeks later, he got this letter.
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:58.289]  Telling him that the ATF was ordering him, in America, outside of law, to do this.
[00:14:59.858 --> 00:15:02.098]  That is the essence of tyranny.
[00:15:02.379 --> 00:15:25.003]  And then, I began to remember that Obama had told the Brady campaign and others, they'd been in the Washington Post, World Net Daily, months before, don't worry, I can't get the votes in Congress to restrict guns, I'm going to use the executive branch and the bureaucracy by stealth or quote, under the radar.
[00:15:25.603 --> 00:15:26.744]  This is illegal!
[00:15:27.684 --> 00:15:28.804]  But they're setting a precedent.
[00:15:29.889 --> 00:15:37.975]  Where the ATF, outside of law, basically turns them into confidential informants against law-abiding citizens.
[00:15:38.356 --> 00:15:54.208]  I have confirmed through two Texas gun dealers, and through someone in my office, that when you buy two rifles, and by the way, it's in this letter, or two handguns, revolver or pistol,
[00:15:56.129 --> 00:16:05.273]  That you get an ATF or FBI visit to your house and they demand to come in your home and see your guns without a warrant.
[00:16:05.353 --> 00:16:09.895]  It's a chilling effect, it's intimidation, just like in Nazi Germany.
[00:16:10.236 --> 00:16:16.899]  And I got another document that the FBI has issued to gun dealers implying that people buying guns
[00:16:18.001 --> 00:16:24.987]  Who talk about stopping power, and if they ask, what's a good gun to stop a criminal, that you're going to call the FBI on them.
[00:16:25.007 --> 00:16:31.972]  Remember New Orleans, with the police chief under federal orders saying, all the guns will be taken, no one will be allowed to be armed.
[00:16:32.493 --> 00:16:44.342]  Remember the Army, regular Army and National Guard being sent into wealthy, high and dry areas, and going in and blowing open their gun safes and taking their guns, and arresting the legal, lawful gun owners.
[00:16:45.183 --> 00:16:47.886]  The system does not want armed citizens.
[00:16:47.906 --> 00:16:49.108]  They want to set a precedent.
[00:16:49.488 --> 00:16:58.298]  And as our country goes into designed banker depression, as we implode, they are coming after our guns.
[00:16:58.879 --> 00:17:03.104]  This is how the war against the British Empire started in 1776 at Lexington and Concord.
[00:17:06.496 --> 00:17:14.962]  The system is having the police and military start a fight where they know gun-owning constitutionalists are not going to go along with it.
[00:17:15.603 --> 00:17:20.186]  They are going to start responding as things degenerate, and they're going to be called terrorists.
[00:17:20.967 --> 00:17:32.615]  The system, the social engineers, are sending the ATF and the feds on a collision course with law-abiding patriotic Americans so they can kick off a civil war in America.
[00:17:33.516 --> 00:17:35.077]  In closing, I want to give you the good news.
[00:17:35.598 --> 00:17:48.466]  It was ATF agents that had some good left in them, like Darth Vader, that blew the whistle when three Border Patrol agents and five police officers were killed in the last year by guns that the government shipped into Mexico.
[00:17:48.806 --> 00:17:52.569]  And then the Attorney General, Eric Holder, lied and said that he didn't.
[00:17:52.869 --> 00:17:54.450]  He's been caught perjuring himself.
[00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:56.952]  The head of the ATF has exposed that.
[00:17:57.312 --> 00:18:01.014]  We now have learned that the FBI and DEA are involved in Fast and Furious.
[00:18:01.215 --> 00:18:02.996]  And even when they were caught,
[00:18:03.736 --> 00:18:10.822]  They still use it to restrict the Second Amendment outside of law because they are criminals.
[00:18:11.383 --> 00:18:25.675]  And it's time for good police officers, ATF, FBI, DEA and others to say no I'm not shipping guns to Mexico or Honduras or to Miami to drug gangs to cause a crime wave so you can disarm law-abiding citizens.
[00:18:26.175 --> 00:18:39.763]  Hold this criminal agency and their boss, the Attorney General of the United States, accountable because they've been caught on record and ATF agents have testified that they talked to the White House and they were under Justice Department orders.
[00:18:40.103 --> 00:18:41.023]  Of course they were!
[00:18:41.264 --> 00:18:45.346]  This is the covert undermining of the Second Amendment.
[00:18:45.666 --> 00:18:56.298]  And a staged terror attack with these guns to blame law-abiding citizens as this country goes into a depression and we need these guns to protect ourselves.
[00:18:56.678 --> 00:19:05.067]  The dirtbag control freaks at the Brady Center and the Violence Policy Center and the rest of them know what they're doing.
[00:19:05.788 --> 00:19:13.730]  They're in the business of bringing America to its knees and disarming the American people so we can live under a tyranny.
[00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:28.233]  And even when they're caught, they're so arrogant and so full of chutzpah and bravado that they come out and use what they've publicly staged outside of law to order the gun shops to do this.
[00:19:28.293 --> 00:19:33.714]  And then they go to the people that have bought the guns' homes and harass them without warrants.
[00:19:34.554 --> 00:19:38.417]  This is the fall of the Republic if we don't stand up against it.
[00:19:38.697 --> 00:19:41.559]  I'm Alex Jones reporting from the front lines of the InfoWars.

[00:21:31.648 --> 00:21:36.031]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:21:36.211 --> 00:21:41.915]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:21:42.015 --> 00:21:45.437]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:21:45.657 --> 00:21:48.259]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:48.379 --> 00:21:53.302]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[00:22:00.447 --> 00:22:04.688]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:22:05.008 --> 00:22:05.608]  Number 1.
[00:22:05.928 --> 00:22:09.069]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:22:09.349 --> 00:22:09.889]  Number 2.
[00:22:10.209 --> 00:22:14.750]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:15.530]  It's true.
[00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:20.391]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:22:20.711 --> 00:22:21.251]  Number 3.
[00:22:21.531 --> 00:22:24.812]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:22:25.112 --> 00:22:28.813]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:22:29.033 --> 00:22:29.574]  Number 4.
[00:22:29.814 --> 00:22:32.196]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:22:32.576 --> 00:22:35.980]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:36.480]  Number 5.
[00:22:37.061 --> 00:22:40.984]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:22:41.204 --> 00:22:45.969]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:24:15.376 --> 00:24:18.198]  We are back live coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:18.218 --> 00:24:22.280]  We're opening the phones up on any news item or issue you'd wish to discuss.
[00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:35.248]  I would imagine people would want to talk about the ATF outside of law setting the precedent that they can just tell gun shop dealers to do whatever they want and then go to gun owners and harass them.
[00:24:35.949 --> 00:24:42.032]  I mean if this stands, it's like Ron Paul said a few months ago, they can launch a war in Libya without even consulting Congress.
[00:24:42.092 --> 00:24:44.214]  If they can pass carbon taxes or
[00:24:45.154 --> 00:24:48.215]  Implement carbon taxes without Congress passing them.
[00:24:49.256 --> 00:24:49.996]  They can do anything.
[00:24:50.576 --> 00:24:53.958]  That's why he called it the last nail in the Republic's coffin.
[00:24:54.478 --> 00:25:00.220]  But republics are transient, but also in another way, eternal.
[00:25:01.121 --> 00:25:07.864]  Even though they're killing the Republic, and even if they're totally successful in destroying the Republic, we can revive it.
[00:25:08.584 --> 00:25:10.345]  Ideas are bulletproof.
[00:25:11.235 --> 00:25:14.417]  Now, going over the news, White House takes a victory lap.
[00:25:14.877 --> 00:25:18.939]  Obama 2012, this debate's over.
[00:25:19.359 --> 00:25:21.640]  GOP senator threatens filibuster.
[00:25:22.081 --> 00:25:24.342]  Democratic representatives calls agreement.
[00:25:25.222 --> 00:25:26.203]  Satan sandwich.
[00:25:26.623 --> 00:25:29.585]  Conyers, people should march on White House.
[00:25:30.605 --> 00:25:34.370]  Taxes could still increase 800 billion.
[00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:36.312]  Yeah, that's actually in the agreement.
[00:25:37.233 --> 00:25:39.576]  Boehner rallies his troops.
[00:25:39.776 --> 00:25:48.826]  He was the protege of the globalist Newt Gingrich, who betrayed the conservative movement in the mid-90s, and so his minions now doing an excellent job.
[00:25:49.747 --> 00:25:55.549]  Boehner's moved on and one of his lieutenants will be there butchering the Republic down the road unless we take this country back.
[00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:57.410]  Boehner rallies his troops.
[00:25:57.630 --> 00:25:59.171]  It's all spending cuts.
[00:25:59.671 --> 00:26:01.332]  No real cuts until 2014.
[00:26:01.672 --> 00:26:03.813]  Pelosi balks.
[00:26:04.073 --> 00:26:04.973]  Dow jumps.
[00:26:05.514 --> 00:26:09.575]  And then people actually had a chance to look at the agreement and then it plunged!
[00:26:10.496 --> 00:26:16.258]  We need massive spending cuts and massive tax cuts.
[00:26:17.058 --> 00:26:17.839]  Spending cuts,
[00:26:19.185 --> 00:26:20.805]  And tax cuts.
[00:26:20.865 --> 00:26:23.446]  The economy would roar.
[00:26:24.026 --> 00:26:26.147]  Every major economist is on record.
[00:26:26.747 --> 00:26:27.767]  The facts are there.
[00:26:27.787 --> 00:26:29.708]  I mean, look at Kennedy.
[00:26:29.768 --> 00:26:33.768]  He cut the highest tax bracket by 50 percent because it had been the highest tax rate.
[00:26:34.189 --> 00:26:37.629]  The next two brackets by, what was it, 35 percent.
[00:26:37.669 --> 00:26:38.670]  You can pull those numbers up.
[00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:39.570]  They're famous.
[00:26:40.919 --> 00:26:45.965]  And tax receipts overall doubled the first year and then had large increases the next year.
[00:26:46.986 --> 00:26:49.048]  And the average moron can't figure that out.
[00:26:49.088 --> 00:26:51.170]  They're like, but it's a set-sum game.
[00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:53.813]  You raise taxes, government gets more money.
[00:26:54.294 --> 00:26:54.754]  No, no, no!
[00:26:56.892 --> 00:26:59.293]  You cut taxes, it energizes the economy.
[00:26:59.333 --> 00:27:04.555]  People spend more, invest more, buy more, and more receipts come in.
[00:27:05.136 --> 00:27:06.156]  More money comes in.
[00:27:06.196 --> 00:27:06.716]  They know that.
[00:27:06.917 --> 00:27:11.238]  But it's not enough to cut taxes and cut spending across the board, including defense.
[00:27:11.959 --> 00:27:21.043]  You've got to say, by the way, we want that $27 trillion that the private Federal Reserve stole back.
[00:27:22.303 --> 00:27:25.205]  We're going to claw that back and demand to know where it went.
[00:27:26.431 --> 00:27:41.579]  And we're not going to prop up these derivatives, at which point the big six mega-parasite banks that are setting up the whole world government, financing all the carbon taxes, all the tyranny, they're the corrupt owners through fraud of the planet, they will go completely ape.
[00:27:41.719 --> 00:27:48.163]  But if we identify them as the enemy and as the progenitors of this global meltdown, it will be rough.
[00:27:48.663 --> 00:27:55.687]  But then they won't dare fully implode things out of fear that people will finally wake up and they'll be arrested and sent to prison.
[00:27:57.082 --> 00:28:00.143]  So we make Wall Street take a giant haircut.
[00:28:00.883 --> 00:28:04.584]  Taxpayers should not be signed on to their quote bad bets.
[00:28:05.224 --> 00:28:06.805]  Now remember, they weren't bad bets for them.
[00:28:06.825 --> 00:28:09.666]  They made money on the front end and on the back end with bailouts.
[00:28:10.206 --> 00:28:15.408]  So I don't want to hear about let's cut welfare moms money and let's cut highway funds money.
[00:28:15.868 --> 00:28:21.489]  When the highway funds nationwide are all fully paid for, they just steal the money out the back door like Social Security.
[00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:23.030]  Let's write off
[00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:29.212]  The $600 trillion that the Washington Post claims America owes of the $1.5 quadrillion.
[00:28:29.492 --> 00:28:32.713]  And I keep going back to that because it's absolutely essential.
[00:28:33.153 --> 00:28:35.333]  You don't deal with that, nothing gets fixed.
[00:28:35.693 --> 00:28:39.795]  It is rearranging furniture while your house is burning down.
[00:28:40.195 --> 00:28:42.375]  Or rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.
[00:28:42.435 --> 00:28:43.936]  Or polishing the silverware.
[00:28:44.416 --> 00:28:44.696]  Okay?
[00:28:45.276 --> 00:28:46.936]  This is all much ado about nothing.
[00:28:47.057 --> 00:28:48.277]  We'll be breaking that down more.
[00:28:48.557 --> 00:28:51.678]  But the toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:28:51.698 --> 00:28:52.058]  800-259-9231.
[00:28:52.418 --> 00:28:58.800]  We'll go to your calls coming up in the next segment.
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.501]  A couple segments ahead of our guest joining us.
[00:29:01.721 --> 00:29:04.001]  But here's an example from Time Magazine.
[00:29:05.882 --> 00:29:09.183]  Headline today, Bulldoze, the new way to foreclose.
[00:29:10.256 --> 00:29:16.439]  And you've heard Obama say they want to bulldoze at least a third of Detroit, and that's begun, in areas of Los Angeles and other areas.
[00:29:17.179 --> 00:29:23.962]  Instead of letting housing prices go down, as they should instead of being inflated, the big banks, with banker bailout money,
[00:29:25.245 --> 00:29:38.794]  ...are going in and buying up more houses and getting the foreclosures and the rest of it, many of which they don't even owe, and they're announcing they're going to bulldoze hundreds of thousands of homes conservatively to up the market of their other investments.
[00:29:38.854 --> 00:29:44.597]  So, this is the predatory, self-destructive, cannibalistic economy.
[00:29:44.858 --> 00:29:46.579]  This is the command-destruction economy.
[00:29:46.599 --> 00:29:48.140]  This is the post-industrial world.
[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:49.841]  Destroy housing!
[00:29:50.221 --> 00:29:50.801]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.282 --> 00:29:52.162]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.663 --> 00:29:54.184]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.183 --> 00:29:57.983]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.364 --> 00:30:06.805]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:30:08.005 --> 00:30:12.766]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:30:13.146 --> 00:30:19.927]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:30:21.868 --> 00:30:23.728]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:27.791]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:30:27.851 --> 00:30:34.255]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:30:34.975 --> 00:30:38.037]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[00:30:40.024 --> 00:30:41.906]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:30:42.166 --> 00:30:43.687]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:30:43.947 --> 00:30:46.509]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:53.094]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:30:53.475 --> 00:30:55.677]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:30:56.177 --> 00:30:58.199]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[00:30:58.539 --> 00:30:59.419]  Others don't.
[00:31:00.523 --> 00:31:04.766]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:31:05.067 --> 00:31:05.687]  Number one.
[00:31:05.987 --> 00:31:09.130]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:09.990]  Number two.
[00:31:10.271 --> 00:31:14.834]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:31:15.174 --> 00:31:15.615]  It's true.
[00:31:15.915 --> 00:31:20.478]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:31:20.779 --> 00:31:21.339]  Number three.
[00:31:21.599 --> 00:31:24.902]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:31:25.202 --> 00:31:28.885]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:31:29.085 --> 00:31:29.645]  Number 4.
[00:31:29.885 --> 00:31:32.247]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:31:32.647 --> 00:31:36.029]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:31:36.329 --> 00:31:36.529]  Number 5.
[00:31:37.129 --> 00:31:41.031]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:31:41.271 --> 00:31:46.034]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:31:46.314 --> 00:31:50.336]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:50.476 --> 00:31:52.037]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:52.277 --> 00:31:54.358]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:31:54.518 --> 00:31:56.879]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:32:01.206 --> 00:32:15.678]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:32:16.679 --> 00:32:20.362]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:21.365 --> 00:32:33.378]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:32:34.139 --> 00:32:41.407]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:32:42.088 --> 00:32:51.691]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:32:52.451 --> 00:32:55.732]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:32:56.372 --> 00:32:59.473]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:24.672]  Okay, I'm going to finish up some of the debt ceiling economic news and then go to your phone calls.
[00:33:24.712 --> 00:33:28.075]  Again, the toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[00:33:28.455 --> 00:33:33.300]  When you hear a caller hang up after I go to them, that's your chance to dial and get in.
[00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:34.180]  We'd love to hear from you.
[00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:36.602]  Josh, Nick, Aaron, Steve, Ezekiel.
[00:33:37.563 --> 00:33:38.023]  And others.
[00:33:38.524 --> 00:33:41.566]  We're going to go to you here in just a few minutes.
[00:33:42.526 --> 00:34:01.259]  First off, I want to inform PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, we're simulcasting the radio show right now with a five camera shoot, so you can see video clips, documents, special reports, and a whole other level of documentation, that we did put out a special report.
[00:34:01.479 --> 00:34:03.800]  We did a special report Thursday live.
[00:34:05.241 --> 00:34:11.083]  And now that has been posted to the archive at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:34:11.143 --> 00:34:19.026]  It is a one-hour, 55-minute special report getting into cloning, the dangers of GMO, and a lot more.
[00:34:19.486 --> 00:34:25.428]  The FDA SWAT teaming Amish and other Whole Foods producers with Mike Adams.
[00:34:26.028 --> 00:34:26.690]  In studio.
[00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:30.677]  And then in the second part, in studio, we had Sheriff Richard Mack.
[00:34:30.717 --> 00:34:36.587]  Now, this is not the new TV show that starts Thursday, September 1st, coming up next month.
[00:34:37.455 --> 00:34:38.695]  I guess 30 days from now, now.
[00:34:39.575 --> 00:34:45.397]  No, this is a special report, and we're going to be doing these from time to time.
[00:34:45.417 --> 00:34:55.559]  We're going to be doing one Thursday with Gerald Salente, and that should be 7 o'clock again, 7 p.m.
[00:34:55.999 --> 00:34:56.519]  Central.
[00:34:57.119 --> 00:34:59.900]  That'll be live for folks, but then also archived.
[00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:03.261]  For PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[00:35:03.281 --> 00:35:12.343]  And then I want to encourage PrisonPlanet.tv members who have allowed us to finance the new studio and the new special reports and also the InfoWars nightly news that's coming.
[00:35:12.383 --> 00:35:17.665]  It'll be a 30-minute report every night, but pretty much every week we'll have an hour to two-hour special report on top of it.
[00:35:18.025 --> 00:35:22.666]  We'll also air specially produced reports at the end of the TV show many nights of the week.
[00:35:23.867 --> 00:35:30.493]  More and more is going to move to PrisonPlanet.TV as listeners have begged us over the years because some of the other video sites have censored us.
[00:35:30.833 --> 00:35:37.299]  But we will continue to encourage folks to take parts of the information and repost it, get it out to people.
[00:35:37.599 --> 00:35:46.708]  And also when you're a PrisonPlanet.TV member, to go to PrisonPlanet.TV and download these, burn them to disk, or compress them and then send them to your friends and family.
[00:35:47.428 --> 00:35:59.301]  Because we are really trying to build up our news gathering and presentation arm here because we are reaching tens of millions of people a week alone just on YouTube.
[00:35:59.822 --> 00:36:07.430]  Tens of millions a week alone just on YouTube and that's only one of many different heads on the InfoWars.
[00:36:08.791 --> 00:36:14.356]  Uh, that is attacking the globalists at every level, leading the way, and we couldn't do it without your support.
[00:36:14.376 --> 00:36:18.220]  So if you're not a PrisonPlanet.tv member, we're just adding more and more, more and more, more and more.
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:24.505]  For a couple weeks, we've had the system where I can upload near-lifetime reports I shoot on my iPhone, just like YouTube.
[00:36:25.626 --> 00:36:31.231]  I'm gonna start doing those on PrisonPlanet.tv, but the interface is still a little bit complex for somebody like yours truly.
[00:36:31.251 --> 00:36:37.936]  They're trying to get it dummy proof so I can, you know, sit there and do live reports from my house on the weekend or at night or at 2 a.m.
[00:36:37.956 --> 00:36:38.777]  if I feel like it.
[00:36:40.678 --> 00:36:41.959]  Or so I can upload reports.
[00:36:41.999 --> 00:36:43.080]  There's gonna be all sorts of stuff.
[00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:46.503]  Live reports from home, near live uploads.
[00:36:47.424 --> 00:36:48.725]  It's all built.
[00:36:49.446 --> 00:36:51.888]  It's just that now I have to be taught how to use it.
[00:36:51.968 --> 00:36:53.048]  And let's just say, well,
[00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:56.231]  Computers are not my forte.
[00:36:56.251 --> 00:36:57.812]  I mean, I know how to upload a video to YouTube.
[00:36:58.553 --> 00:37:00.615]  And, you know, if I had the time, I could actually learn how to do anything.
[00:37:00.655 --> 00:37:01.936]  I'm not that bad at this stuff.
[00:37:01.956 --> 00:37:06.799]  It's just that I'm so busy and so used to others doing it for me, but I'm more and more getting into that mode.
[00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:10.122]  So, again, more and more coming to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:37:10.562 --> 00:37:13.505]  If you're not a member, there's eight-plus years of archives.
[00:37:13.545 --> 00:37:16.267]  They're higher-quality audio podcasts, commercial-free every day.
[00:37:16.908 --> 00:37:17.768]  The three-hour
[00:37:18.969 --> 00:37:21.870]  live stream that it's also archived within about an hour of the show.
[00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:27.791]  It goes up there for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and it's an armory of information warfare against the globalist.
[00:37:28.111 --> 00:37:38.094]  PrisonPlanet.tv and don't forget it's your purchase of books, videos, t-shirts that informs you to a higher level, gives you tools to wake up others, gives you tools to meet others.
[00:37:38.414 --> 00:37:42.515]  You wear an InfoWars.com shirt around in public, you're gonna meet like-minded people big time.
[00:37:44.355 --> 00:37:46.716]  It also supports our broadcast and what we do here.
[00:37:46.736 --> 00:37:52.839]  We're not supported like MSNBC and other national TV and newspapers with government bailout money stolen from taxpayers.
[00:37:53.519 --> 00:37:56.800]  We're not like the, you know, Dallas Cowboys who make you buy them a stadium.
[00:37:57.361 --> 00:38:00.222]  Or Formula One here in Austin trying to make taxpayers pay for their...
[00:38:00.802 --> 00:38:02.163]  They're a giant racetrack.
[00:38:02.523 --> 00:38:03.303]  You know, we're here.
[00:38:03.744 --> 00:38:06.885]  We're not the IRS that comes at gunpoint, takes your money and uses it against you.
[00:38:07.225 --> 00:38:13.669]  We're asking you in the free market to vote with your money and support the InfoWars now more than ever.
[00:38:13.729 --> 00:38:15.450]  And look what we've built together.
[00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:16.870]  Thank you so much for your support.
[00:38:17.111 --> 00:38:18.871]  Put the online video bookstore at InfoWars.com.
[00:38:19.972 --> 00:38:25.216]  Then of course, PrisonPlanet.tv or you can call toll free to ask about any of the combos and book and video specials we have.
[00:38:25.236 --> 00:38:25.476]  888-253-3139.
[00:38:25.496 --> 00:38:25.536]  888-253-3139.
[00:38:25.556 --> 00:38:26.937]  You can also get two silver dollars for $85.
[00:38:26.997 --> 00:38:27.738]  You can't buy those
[00:38:34.983 --> 00:38:35.243]  I think so.
[00:38:54.139 --> 00:38:55.119]  Okay, I'm done ranting about that.
[00:38:55.139 --> 00:38:55.860]  I want to go to your calls.
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:00.061]  Getting back to the fact that the Associated Press, the Daily Mail, and others have done the analysis.
[00:39:00.081 --> 00:39:00.481]  In fact, here's
[00:39:19.622 --> 00:39:35.671]  Another article too, this is from Chicago Tribune, saying that they're, so that's Daily Mail, AP and Chicago Tribune, all have done an analysis of the new debt deal that came out this morning that hadn't passed yet, but they quote, have until tomorrow afternoon to get it through or global calamities will happen.
[00:39:35.932 --> 00:39:42.776]  We're being trained that our nation doesn't stand on its ingenuity, on its developments, on its hard work.
[00:39:43.635 --> 00:39:51.302]  No, it's all about the bankers, all about ratings agencies, and Moody's came out, of course, over the weekend and said, even if you do either plan, you're going to end up defaulting.
[00:39:51.342 --> 00:39:54.545]  America is bankrupt.
[00:39:55.506 --> 00:39:59.189]  Only because we've been forced to sign on to derivatives that we don't owe the vast majority of.
[00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:02.672]  And then we get lectured by the very banks we've bailed out.
[00:40:02.692 --> 00:40:03.673]  You've got to love that.
[00:40:05.455 --> 00:40:07.437]  It's rich, very, very rich to buy it.
[00:40:10.239 --> 00:40:16.647]  Middle classes to be hit by tax increase by the backdoor Obama and Boehner face furious backlash from their own parties.
[00:40:17.087 --> 00:40:19.250]  Last-minute debt deal is slammed as a fudge.
[00:40:20.239 --> 00:40:20.800]  Or a lie.
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:25.084]  President Barack Obama awoke today to a furious reaction to his last-minute deal.
[00:40:25.504 --> 00:40:29.828]  And again, the stock market jumped before people had read it, and then when they read it, it tanked.
[00:40:30.229 --> 00:40:31.490]  We'll put that graph back up there.
[00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:33.792]  DrudgeReport.com has a good graph.
[00:40:33.812 --> 00:40:35.433]  We have one on Infowars.com as well.
[00:40:36.534 --> 00:40:44.122]  The president and congressional leaders last night finally announced an agreement on emergency legislation to avert the nation's first-ever financial default.
[00:40:44.926 --> 00:40:48.869]  From the greatest creditor nation 50 years ago, to bankers, slaves, and it's all through fraud.
[00:40:49.409 --> 00:40:52.512]  But while you pay them to rape you, you gotta love it.
[00:40:53.112 --> 00:40:59.637]  But while the dramatic resolution briefly lifted a cloud that threatened to still fragile economic recovery.
[00:40:59.957 --> 00:41:01.078]  Oh, we're in a recovery!
[00:41:01.098 --> 00:41:01.799]  Did you hear that one?
[00:41:04.093 --> 00:41:05.233]  I'll buy that for a dollar.
[00:41:05.694 --> 00:41:14.137]  Critics said in the long run that middle class would bear the brunt of the country's massive debt and increased taxes set to cover the White House's reluctance to cut public spending.
[00:41:14.517 --> 00:41:17.219]  And then it goes into all the different tax increases.
[00:41:17.919 --> 00:41:20.300]  And so does the Chicago...
[00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:27.552]  Chicago Tribune says the White House has one important tool in its arsenal of influence.
[00:41:27.572 --> 00:41:30.693]  Congressional talks over further deficit reduction measures in the coming months.
[00:41:32.234 --> 00:41:34.235]  The Bush-era tax cuts expiring.
[00:41:35.236 --> 00:41:39.019]  But it goes on in this deal, it basically kicks those back in.
[00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:44.525]  The agreement, which will still be approved by lawmakers, would cut about $2.4 trillion from the deficit.
[00:41:44.625 --> 00:41:48.088]  That doesn't happen until a few years from now, and then over 10 years when it starts.
[00:41:48.508 --> 00:41:53.012]  With a congressional committee set up to find $1.5 trillion in cuts.
[00:41:53.132 --> 00:41:54.674]  So it's all just lies.
[00:41:55.575 --> 00:41:58.057]  Tax reform and other deficit reduction measures.
[00:41:59.577 --> 00:42:04.381]  And it just goes on to say that basically they're proposing within this the tax increases.
[00:42:04.902 --> 00:42:07.564]  So there you have it.
[00:42:10.067 --> 00:42:15.191]  And then Dr. Paul Craig Roberts breaks down that this is orchestrated and is going to be disastrous.
[00:42:15.712 --> 00:42:22.878]  Stocks again have slid on weak manufacturing news and the fact that there's not really a lot of tax.
[00:42:26.121 --> 00:42:27.141]  Positives in this.
[00:42:27.361 --> 00:42:30.782]  Tax increases loitering around like Barracuda off the coast.
[00:42:31.242 --> 00:42:33.703]  And then at the same time, the cuts aren't real.
[00:42:33.743 --> 00:42:38.644]  It's like, I will look with a blue ribbon commission down the road at these cuts.
[00:42:38.664 --> 00:42:44.245]  We're going deeper into debt to the banks who just create this out of nothing.
[00:42:44.265 --> 00:42:47.506]  But we've signed on to it under the 1913 Federal Reserve Act.
[00:42:47.806 --> 00:42:49.767]  But I want to go back to this article.
[00:42:51.312 --> 00:42:56.354]  Out of Time Magazine, bulldoze the new way to foreclose.
[00:42:57.255 --> 00:43:04.918]  And that is a nice component or a nice little friend.
[00:43:05.278 --> 00:43:06.278]  What's the word I'm looking for?
[00:43:06.298 --> 00:43:10.120]  A nice compliment.
[00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:21.046]  To this article, Bank Post 11.5 billion profit, much of which was banker bailout money, and announces 30,000 job cuts.
[00:43:21.126 --> 00:43:23.527]  And this has been going on for two years now with these big mega banks.
[00:43:23.847 --> 00:43:25.408]  They're getting rid of their retail banking.
[00:43:26.489 --> 00:43:29.370]  They're getting rid of service banking and car loans.
[00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:33.613]  You know, they've been given tens of trillions of dollars, but it's harder than ever to get a house loan, a car loan.
[00:43:33.833 --> 00:43:35.274]  Even if you've got great credit, it's really hard.
[00:43:36.181 --> 00:43:43.284]  As many people have experienced, and they're just getting rid or cutting back the retail sectors.
[00:43:43.904 --> 00:43:45.605]  They don't need you.
[00:43:45.865 --> 00:43:52.627]  They're destroying and consolidating a post-industrial country, a command-destruction system, the opposite of free market.
[00:43:52.827 --> 00:43:57.129]  They always lecture everyone about, we're free market, we're free market.
[00:43:57.629 --> 00:43:59.410]  They've gotten, and we haven't gotten numbers in a year.
[00:44:02.686 --> 00:44:13.033]  In 2008, 2009, early 2010, the last number that private banks have been given, that they then paid off MSNBC and other media outlets with, was $27 trillion, Bloomberg and AP reported.
[00:44:13.754 --> 00:44:15.235]  They had to sue to get that information.
[00:44:15.495 --> 00:44:16.916]  It's been a year, we haven't learned anything.
[00:44:17.216 --> 00:44:18.617]  We just know it's still going on.
[00:44:18.657 --> 00:44:26.522]  So I say $27 trillion, know that it's probably, if you follow the previous growth curve in two years, let me see, $27 trillion, so what's a third of that?
[00:44:27.783 --> 00:44:28.183]  We're talking 14.
[00:44:31.176 --> 00:44:32.117]  $13.5 trillion or more.
[00:44:32.797 --> 00:44:35.799]  So we're talking $40-something trillion.
[00:44:36.579 --> 00:44:37.579]  Right at $40 trillion.
[00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:38.620]  We don't know though.
[00:44:40.821 --> 00:44:44.623]  And when you give them that money, you're going to pay that back to them in taxes.
[00:44:44.883 --> 00:44:52.007]  You give them the money, they buy the treasury bills, and then you pay taxes to them on that?
[00:44:52.927 --> 00:44:54.288]  Man, you can't make this stuff up.
[00:44:54.308 --> 00:44:55.329]  Alright, I'm going to go to your calls.
[00:44:56.311 --> 00:44:59.252]  But it's announcing that there are nearly 1.7 million homes in the U.S.
[00:44:59.312 --> 00:45:00.452]  in some sort of foreclosure.
[00:45:00.492 --> 00:45:04.693]  Banks already own some of these homes and will soon have repossessed many more.
[00:45:05.513 --> 00:45:12.415]  Many housing economists worry that the near constant stream of home sales and banks could keep housing prices down.
[00:45:12.455 --> 00:45:13.515]  Well, they're supposed to be down.
[00:45:13.535 --> 00:45:14.635]  They got way too inflated.
[00:45:15.215 --> 00:45:17.716]  But what if some of those homes never hit the market?
[00:45:18.638 --> 00:45:27.285]  And it goes on to talk about, in Cleveland alone, Bank of America has demolished a hundred, has announced they're going to demolish a hundred homes alone, one megabank.
[00:45:28.686 --> 00:45:33.469]  And they'll even foreclose on houses they don't ever own, or never had a deed to, and then bulldoze it.
[00:45:34.310 --> 00:45:36.671]  And they're announcing they're going to bulldoze at least a third of Detroit.
[00:45:37.292 --> 00:45:43.096]  Wells Fargo announced 800 homes, or has demolished 800.
[00:45:43.136 --> 00:45:44.017]  JP Morgan is demolished
[00:45:49.778 --> 00:45:50.319]  A whole bunch.
[00:46:05.954 --> 00:46:06.415]  In cash.
[00:46:06.475 --> 00:46:07.455]  I played the CNN clip.
[00:46:08.096 --> 00:46:09.837]  Holmes bought foreign cash years ago.
[00:46:09.917 --> 00:46:10.818]  Million dollar home.
[00:46:11.138 --> 00:46:13.160]  The people are like, we paid cash.
[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:17.103]  Bank of America never even had a deed to the people that sold it to us, but they took it.
[00:46:17.644 --> 00:46:22.067]  And finally the judge gave them their house back and said, now you got to pay the people their money back.
[00:46:22.087 --> 00:46:23.308]  A couple hundred thousand.
[00:46:23.328 --> 00:46:25.270]  Bank of America said, no, we don't care about your bank ruling.
[00:46:25.590 --> 00:46:32.275]  So five months later, they sent the constable into the Bank of America and took the money out of the till.
[00:46:32.336 --> 00:46:33.056]  That's a court order.
[00:46:33.997 --> 00:46:34.858]  Took it out of the till.
[00:46:35.899 --> 00:46:36.739]  What you're supposed to do!
[00:46:37.019 --> 00:46:37.940]  That's a court order!
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:39.300]  That's adjudicated!
[00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:48.443]  Not cops take a thousand bucks out of your wallet, you know, because you're downtown and they think you should have a thousand bucks in your pocket, even if you have the ATM receipt for it, that it's yours.
[00:46:48.763 --> 00:46:49.883]  Courts have ruled they can take it!
[00:46:50.903 --> 00:46:52.984]  Well, how about the courts actually get constitutional?
[00:46:53.864 --> 00:46:54.745]  Alright, I'm gonna go to your calls.
[00:46:54.805 --> 00:46:55.445]  It's just that, uh...
[00:46:56.735 --> 00:47:06.319]  There's another report here, and this is happening all over the world because they've been devaluing currencies the last decade, and so all major housing systems have gone up.
[00:47:07.979 --> 00:47:13.201]  There's a report here, Israelis strike over housing cost of living.
[00:47:13.322 --> 00:47:14.242]  They've had the same bubble.
[00:47:16.087 --> 00:47:16.947]  Haaretz is reporting.
[00:47:17.027 --> 00:47:21.968]  I wonder if they will just have the houses destroyed.
[00:47:22.028 --> 00:47:24.209]  See, we're not going to let the housing price go down.
[00:47:24.529 --> 00:47:26.189]  We're just going to bulldoze these houses.
[00:47:26.369 --> 00:47:29.770]  We're not going to cut the price and sell them to people that need housing in America.
[00:47:30.090 --> 00:47:31.710]  No, we're going to destroy the economy.
[00:47:32.331 --> 00:47:36.972]  And if the economy tries to get back up on its feet, we're going to put carbon taxes on it.
[00:47:37.372 --> 00:47:38.652]  This is the new world order.
[00:47:39.252 --> 00:47:40.613]  This is artificial scarcity.
[00:47:40.813 --> 00:47:43.515]  And they're doing it with oil, diamonds, water.
[00:47:43.875 --> 00:47:46.337]  They're doing it with all of these systems.
[00:47:46.797 --> 00:47:48.318]  This is what globalism is.
[00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:53.541]  All right, let's go ahead and go to your calls.
[00:47:53.961 --> 00:47:55.382]  Let's talk to Josh in Florida.
[00:47:55.402 --> 00:47:56.203]  Josh, you're on the air.
[00:47:56.243 --> 00:47:56.543]  Welcome.
[00:47:57.844 --> 00:47:58.144]  Hello.
[00:47:58.204 --> 00:47:58.765]  Thank you, sir.
[00:48:00.486 --> 00:48:02.207]  I had a couple of questions.
[00:48:02.627 --> 00:48:06.530]  I wanted to ask Ron Paul.
[00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:08.551]  You stand by Ron Paul?
[00:48:09.462 --> 00:48:18.448]  I think Ron Paul's got a really great voting record, and he's done an incredible job in serving his supporters, educating people about the Federal Reserve and not just the puppet government.
[00:48:19.409 --> 00:48:27.735]  And I know Ron Paul personally, and I've interviewed him hundreds of times in the last 16 years, and absolutely, of course I support Ron Paul.
[00:48:29.416 --> 00:48:36.221]  I just, I was a little, I was a little worried about it because he, you know, is a Republican, and I know that
[00:48:37.202 --> 00:48:41.047]  The two factions of one party don't get anything done.
[00:48:55.851 --> 00:49:00.633]  But Ron Paul, almost every speech he gives, he talks about that.
[00:49:00.673 --> 00:49:02.914]  He's exposing both parties right now.
[00:49:03.834 --> 00:49:11.837]  And he got into Congress as a libertarian, but they were able to block him with a party machine, so he got kicked out of Congress.
[00:49:11.877 --> 00:49:17.999]  And so he said, I'm really a libertarian constitutionalist, and I'm going to run using the Republican Party system.
[00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:23.141]  So using the machinery is one thing, but it's kind of like this
[00:49:25.367 --> 00:49:32.190]  Low-level, false, logical thing that, you know, Ron Paul must be bad because he's in a major political party.
[00:49:32.830 --> 00:49:39.813]  He could be called, he could be part of the Keebler Elf Party, or the Bull Moose Party, whatever name you want to give it.
[00:49:40.454 --> 00:49:42.795]  As long, it's the fruits of the man.
[00:49:42.855 --> 00:49:43.755]  It's the voting record.
[00:49:44.195 --> 00:49:45.796]  People stand on what they've done.
[00:49:45.816 --> 00:49:47.837]  I mean, does that answer your question?
[00:49:47.857 --> 00:49:49.157]  Because I'm having trouble understanding it.
[00:49:50.118 --> 00:49:54.840]  Well, it's just, you know, putting, I have difficulty putting trust in
[00:49:55.566 --> 00:50:03.110]  You know, anybody, because it's like, yeah, they do these great things and then... Okay, I'm going to stop you right there.
[00:50:03.170 --> 00:50:04.050]  I'm going to stop you right there.
[00:50:04.651 --> 00:50:09.874]  We're not putting all of our eggs in one basket and putting all our hopes on Ron Paul to win the presidency.
[00:50:10.514 --> 00:50:18.778]  Even if he doesn't win the presidency, he's going to be there educating people in the debates and campaigning and really bringing out true ideas of liberty.
[00:50:18.818 --> 00:50:21.980]  But if you can't understand me, Josh, let me put it to you this way.
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:23.801]  Do you have a favorite restaurant, Josh?
[00:50:25.339 --> 00:50:25.940]  Not really, no.
[00:50:33.345 --> 00:50:35.386]  And so it's not that I put my trust in them.
[00:50:35.766 --> 00:50:36.667]  I go once, it's good.
[00:50:36.687 --> 00:50:37.587]  I go twice, it's good.
[00:50:37.987 --> 00:50:42.029]  The tenth time, I start, man, there's no question where I'm going to eat a steak.
[00:50:42.869 --> 00:50:49.132]  Okay, so yes, I guess someday I might get a bad steak there, but I've never gotten a bad steak from Ron Paul, politically.
[00:50:49.732 --> 00:50:54.695]  All I've gotten is choice, premium, absolute, juiciest filet mignon.
[00:50:55.658 --> 00:50:56.639]  Okay, so yes.
[00:50:57.759 --> 00:51:00.641]  Now the other politicians I've gotten rotten horse meat with maggots in it.
[00:51:01.121 --> 00:51:04.383]  Attention gardeners, this is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[00:51:04.623 --> 00:51:08.945]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs.
[00:51:09.166 --> 00:51:17.030]  It's called Proto-Gro and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[00:51:17.350 --> 00:51:20.171]  Now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[00:51:20.452 --> 00:51:27.995]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[00:51:28.095 --> 00:51:33.678]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[00:51:33.918 --> 00:51:39.481]  Proto-Gro's full spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[00:51:39.761 --> 00:51:43.003]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[00:51:43.283 --> 00:51:46.648]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[00:51:46.888 --> 00:51:51.935]  GCN listeners who want to grow dirt cheap superfoods should visit the Proto-Gro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[00:51:51.955 --> 00:51:54.819]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[00:51:54.879 --> 00:51:55.060]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:52:00.578 --> 00:52:04.601]  You don't need me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis.
[00:52:05.022 --> 00:52:06.243]  Everyone can feel it.
[00:52:06.523 --> 00:52:14.970]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[00:52:15.411 --> 00:52:18.593]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising.
[00:52:18.853 --> 00:52:19.714]  But take heart.
[00:52:19.734 --> 00:52:23.417]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[00:52:23.698 --> 00:52:28.682]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war.
[00:52:29.082 --> 00:52:32.626]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[00:52:32.927 --> 00:52:34.389]  The globalists are scared.
[00:52:34.649 --> 00:52:35.650]  They've overreached.
[00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:39.134]  The future of the info war is in your hands.

[00:54:02.222 --> 00:54:12.453]  You know, a lot of people in America have woken up to the fact that they're being lied to.
[00:54:13.694 --> 00:54:18.159]  But then, they just don't trust anybody or anything.
[00:54:19.482 --> 00:54:21.422]  You have to look at the body of somebody's work.
[00:54:21.502 --> 00:54:22.523]  Have they ever made mistakes?
[00:54:22.543 --> 00:54:23.503]  Do they get things wrong?
[00:54:23.543 --> 00:54:24.003]  I'm sure.
[00:54:24.343 --> 00:54:30.364]  But overall, as somebody getting into liberty and freedom and standing up for what's right, what is their roots?
[00:54:30.444 --> 00:54:35.446]  Ron Paul, for 35 years, exposing the banking cartel, writing books, lecturing.
[00:54:35.506 --> 00:54:36.606]  He's always been the same.
[00:54:36.906 --> 00:54:39.807]  His voting record always stands for what he believes in.
[00:54:40.687 --> 00:54:46.028]  And people say, well, yeah, he's done a lot of good things, but as Josh said earlier, but how do I trust him?
[00:54:47.168 --> 00:54:48.469]  How do I know he's for real?
[00:54:49.349 --> 00:54:51.030]  He might turn against us down the road.
[00:54:52.371 --> 00:54:57.054]  And that's like saying, you know, well, this restaurant's always been great, but it might become bad someday.
[00:54:57.414 --> 00:55:02.638]  Well, then why would you go with restaurants that you know are horrible and that you've had bad experiences with?
[00:55:03.138 --> 00:55:05.279]  But again, it's not about Ron Paul, as he said.
[00:55:05.319 --> 00:55:06.460]  It's about us individually.
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:07.781]  What do we stand for?
[00:55:09.762 --> 00:55:13.945]  Are we going to start talking about real issues and getting back to the Constitution?
[00:55:14.833 --> 00:55:27.318]  Instead of this almost obsession with spending all our time talking about people that are fighting tyranny, and nitpicking them, instead of talking about the banks that are openly robbing and raping us.
[00:55:29.119 --> 00:55:34.861]  And the TSA, and the tyranny, and the warrantless wiretapping, and the police brutality, and the corruption.
[00:55:35.641 --> 00:55:38.102]  But see, people see that as a big monolithic bureaucracy.
[00:55:38.122 --> 00:55:39.283]  They feel powerless at it.
[00:55:40.003 --> 00:55:41.504]  And so they tend to go after the messenger.
[00:55:41.544 --> 00:55:43.084]  And I understand that psychology.
[00:55:43.505 --> 00:55:43.865]  I get it.
[00:55:45.327 --> 00:55:49.528]  But I really, I'd give Ron Paul about a 99.
[00:55:50.249 --> 00:55:53.530]  I don't like the fact that he doesn't get into modern false flag.
[00:55:53.550 --> 00:55:59.832]  He does say the CIA brings drugs in, that our government has staged terror attacks before, like Tonkin and Ajax and others.
[00:56:01.712 --> 00:56:02.152]  I'd give him about a 99.
[00:56:02.572 --> 00:56:04.273]  I'd give Rand about a 97.
[00:56:05.673 --> 00:56:08.474]  But I mean, compared to the other people, they are ideologues.
[00:56:08.514 --> 00:56:10.755]  They do really stand for what they believe in.
[00:56:12.302 --> 00:56:15.944]  Nowadays, I guess, an ideologue is kind of a bad term to use, but I kind of think of it as good.
[00:56:15.964 --> 00:56:18.605]  I mean, this person, like, what is the definition of ideologue?
[00:56:18.625 --> 00:56:19.625]  Am I even using the right term?
[00:56:20.006 --> 00:56:21.466]  Nick in California, you're on the air.
[00:56:21.486 --> 00:56:21.867]  Go ahead.
[00:56:22.987 --> 00:56:23.407]  Hey, Alex.
[00:56:24.388 --> 00:56:25.748]  I am like a 16-year-old kid.
[00:56:25.768 --> 00:56:29.190]  I live in Los Angeles, and I gotta say, I've been listening to your show forever.
[00:56:29.230 --> 00:56:31.171]  My dad turned me on to it when I was like a little kid.
[00:56:32.063 --> 00:56:34.346]  And, you know, we are doing a great job.
[00:56:34.386 --> 00:56:38.530]  A lot of my friends in school, you know, they're getting awake and just learning more about this.
[00:56:38.590 --> 00:56:39.491]  I've turned them on to you.
[00:56:39.531 --> 00:56:42.214]  I've turned them on to Invisible Empire and Follow the Republic.
[00:56:42.274 --> 00:56:44.936]  And it's, you know, it's really moving forward.
[00:56:44.976 --> 00:56:47.960]  And I, you know, I got to say, I just thank you for what you're doing.
[00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:52.084]  And I know a lot of people who are really waking up on Twitter and even on Facebook.
[00:56:52.104 --> 00:56:53.465]  And, you know, you're right.
[00:56:53.485 --> 00:56:55.047]  We're using their propaganda against them.
[00:56:57.028 --> 00:56:58.088]  Well, absolutely.
[00:56:58.128 --> 00:57:00.709]  We're using their systems to incredible effect.
[00:57:00.769 --> 00:57:02.409]  They are panicking right now.
[00:57:02.529 --> 00:57:04.609]  Congress has a 9% approval rating.
[00:57:05.049 --> 00:57:08.210]  That shows that people, by and large, are awake.
[00:57:08.310 --> 00:57:24.353]  They're not awake at a sophisticated level, but once the doors open for people to be open-minded, hence the term open-minded, open door, now is the time to be working like slaves, to get the word out.
[00:57:25.060 --> 00:57:26.823]  You know, there's that old term, working like the devil.
[00:57:27.364 --> 00:57:28.786]  The globalists are working like the devil.
[00:57:28.826 --> 00:57:31.991]  We've got to work like people that want to not be slaves.
[00:57:32.712 --> 00:57:33.494]  Anything else, sir?
[00:57:35.123 --> 00:58:03.301]  Um, also just, uh, you know, a thing that's kind of a, like a bad thing that I deal with in my daily life is, like, um, you know, in school it's just, it's so bureaucratic and just the whole school system and education is just completely messed up and that's something that I'm really pushing to get, like, reformed and really to be actually just where people and kids are learning and they're not just, you know, studying for a test and then they just forget it all after and, you know, it's all just about, you know, passing in good grades and all that stuff, even though it's really about learning and applying what you're learning.
[00:58:04.071 --> 00:58:04.671]  Absolutely.
[00:58:04.872 --> 00:58:05.672]  Good job, my friend.
[00:58:05.712 --> 00:58:06.352]  Good to hear from you.
[00:58:06.372 --> 00:58:09.374]  We're going to come back and go to Aaron, Steve, Ezekiel, Jason, and others.
[00:58:09.994 --> 00:58:13.777]  And then, of course, we have Lennon LaRouche joining us.
[00:58:13.937 --> 00:58:15.938]  And I just got a special communique from them.
[00:58:17.599 --> 00:58:22.882]  It says, Jaron, we are now getting briefed that everything you read in the press on Senate-House agreement
[00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:25.160]  And the press is a lie.
[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:26.761]  Well, that's what the stock market says.
[00:58:26.801 --> 00:58:28.361]  It first went way up and then plunged.
[00:58:28.961 --> 00:58:31.042]  We are about to lose the United States of civilization.
[00:58:31.362 --> 00:58:32.402]  This is a Hitler coup.
[00:58:32.822 --> 00:58:34.703]  There is going to be Americans dead in the streets.
[00:58:35.223 --> 00:58:36.663]  We can still turn this around.
[00:58:36.683 --> 00:58:39.644]  Lynn will have more in the subject of the interview.
[00:58:39.884 --> 00:58:40.244]  Don.
[00:58:44.545 --> 00:58:48.506]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:52.028 --> 00:58:53.529]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:53.729 --> 00:58:58.772]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:58:59.052 --> 00:59:00.413]  Saving means to make money.
[00:59:00.573 --> 00:59:09.418]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:59:10.119 --> 00:59:17.183]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:59:17.643 --> 00:59:25.246]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:59:25.626 --> 00:59:30.548]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[00:59:30.868 --> 00:59:34.330]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091 or see Calvin on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[00:59:34.350 --> 00:59:38.672]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091 or see Calvin on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[00:59:53.829 --> 00:59:55.731]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.211 --> 00:59:59.053]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.599 --> 01:00:06.239]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:07.960]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.661 --> 01:00:09.802]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.422 --> 01:00:11.243]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.004 --> 01:00:13.925]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.945 --> 01:00:17.208]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.748 --> 01:00:21.832]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.409 --> 01:00:27.510]  Lennon LaRouche is joining us for the rest of the hour, coming up the next segment.
[01:00:27.530 --> 01:00:29.170]  I'm going to continue with your calls right now.
[01:00:29.871 --> 01:00:33.832]  And those of you that are holding in the second half of the interview, you'll get a chance to talk to Lennon LaRouche.
[01:00:34.332 --> 01:00:36.513]  If not, hang up and we'll let other callers in.
[01:00:36.553 --> 01:00:39.593]  The toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9031.
[01:00:39.834 --> 01:00:43.014]  You know, a guy was asking earlier, can you trust Ron Paul?
[01:00:43.115 --> 01:00:44.355]  And I said, well, he's an ideologue.
[01:00:45.236 --> 01:00:46.636]  And I see that as a good thing.
[01:00:46.676 --> 01:00:52.658]  I mean, you know, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, not swerving from that, because the system always wants us to compromise.
[01:00:52.978 --> 01:00:55.458]  But then I thought, is that the exact definition I'd want to use?
[01:00:56.099 --> 01:00:56.299]  No.
[01:00:56.459 --> 01:00:57.359]  A man of principle.
[01:00:58.519 --> 01:00:59.779]  A man who sticks to his principles.
[01:00:59.819 --> 01:01:03.560]  But if you go to Webster's Dictionary, an impractical idealist.
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:06.321]  You see, they've kind of changed the definition over time.
[01:01:07.725 --> 01:01:13.226]  Well, I guess I'm impractical idealist because I'm not giving up my Second Amendment, or family rights, or any of it.
[01:01:13.546 --> 01:01:14.527]  Or I'm against abortion.
[01:01:14.567 --> 01:01:15.687]  I'm against a culture of death.
[01:01:16.327 --> 01:01:16.987]  I'm an ideologue.
[01:01:18.127 --> 01:01:22.829]  An often blindly partisan advocate or adherent of a particular ideology.
[01:01:23.169 --> 01:01:30.130]  Well, folks, if you're going to risk your name, your treasure, jail for what you believe in, I mean, Leonard LaRouche, they set him up.
[01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:32.111]  White House came after him, put him in prison for no reason.
[01:01:32.151 --> 01:01:32.691]  That's on record.
[01:01:34.577 --> 01:01:35.498]  You've got to be committed.
[01:01:35.898 --> 01:01:41.301]  I mean, if you're a fighter-bomber pilot flying in over North Korea in the Korean War, you better be an ideologue.
[01:01:41.981 --> 01:01:44.483]  You better be absolutely committed to be risking your life.
[01:01:45.483 --> 01:01:45.903]  Real simple.
[01:01:46.844 --> 01:01:50.386]  An often blindly partisan advocate or adherent of a particular ideology.
[01:01:52.247 --> 01:01:54.648]  Defined for English language learners.
[01:01:54.688 --> 01:01:56.289]  Let's go ahead and go back to your calls.
[01:01:56.709 --> 01:01:59.251]  Aaron in Nevada, then Steve Ezekiel and others.
[01:01:59.271 --> 01:01:59.811]  Go ahead, Aaron.
[01:02:01.408 --> 01:02:02.568]  Any high-info warriors?
[01:02:03.209 --> 01:02:07.210]  I just want you to know, I've done a piece on Alex at my website, gonav.com.
[01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:08.270]  Alright, that's enough.
[01:02:08.290 --> 01:02:11.951]  We're not here for all the jealous snipers and all that.
[01:02:12.011 --> 01:02:15.172]  It's a serious radio broadcast for serious people, okay?
[01:02:15.192 --> 01:02:18.713]  If you want to call and disagree with something I've said, we'll keep you on for 20 minutes as we do.
[01:02:18.973 --> 01:02:23.294]  But if you just call in and just want to plug yourself because you want to be a big man, that's great.
[01:02:23.574 --> 01:02:26.775]  You guys would have people following you and listening to you if you covered real issues.
[01:02:27.395 --> 01:02:28.296]  Instead of infighting.
[01:02:28.356 --> 01:02:30.578]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Steve in Illinois.
[01:02:30.878 --> 01:02:31.619]  Steve, you're on the air.
[01:02:31.659 --> 01:02:32.040]  Go ahead.
[01:02:33.281 --> 01:02:34.382]  Yes, Ditto.
[01:02:35.383 --> 01:02:38.226]  And Ron Paul, I have a problem.
[01:02:38.266 --> 01:02:41.589]  Well, let me tell you, John, you're a call selector, Nat.
[01:02:41.769 --> 01:02:42.630]  He is a prince.
[01:02:42.710 --> 01:02:45.493]  I've been talking to him for about four years, about 31 years.
[01:02:46.033 --> 01:02:48.215]  The different call screeners, Nat, there's none better.
[01:02:48.896 --> 01:02:50.718]  Ron Paul, the problem I have with him,
[01:02:51.238 --> 01:02:57.623]  He's only one person against 435 bribed, threatened, or blackmailed partners.
[01:02:57.703 --> 01:02:58.184]  Exactly.
[01:02:58.384 --> 01:03:06.891]  All he is is somebody that can report for us what's going on in Congress and use his prominent pulpit to alert people to what's going on.
[01:03:08.372 --> 01:03:14.217]  I regret that I've only got one life to give for my country, as so spoken by our founders, one of our founders.
[01:03:14.717 --> 01:03:20.542]  You know, this, you're talking on the tax reducement and that
[01:03:21.075 --> 01:03:26.056]  You know, the middle class in this country has all but been abolished.
[01:03:26.876 --> 01:03:28.557]  And you know what shows the economic pie?
[01:03:28.717 --> 01:03:32.677]  These corporation shysters are paying the lowest they ever have.
[01:03:33.158 --> 01:03:35.598]  They don't pay tax in the first place, people do.
[01:03:36.178 --> 01:03:44.600]  And the reason they run to other countries and given tax incentives to do it ever since Reagan, that's how long I've been on the radio,
[01:03:45.561 --> 01:03:57.068]  Is because, I think one quarter is, sure, they'll pay no taxes that they can't push off onto the people, but three quarters of the reason they go there is for slave wages.
[01:03:57.168 --> 01:04:11.936]  That's it, and then they control our economic system and get rid of our tariffs when the other countries have them, through wages, through currency, through no environmental standards, and then by shutting us down that increases their overseas investments, and we've seen NAFTA and GATT.
[01:04:12.236 --> 01:04:13.377]  We've seen globalism.
[01:04:13.657 --> 01:04:18.400]  And now Time Magazine says they've already bulldozed tens of thousands of houses they've repossessed.
[01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:25.845]  Now they're going to start doing it to even more, destroying our economy so there's less housing, less production, less real wealth.
[01:04:26.225 --> 01:04:27.927]  This is the predatory economy.
[01:04:27.967 --> 01:04:39.234]  And they're so arrogant, they have all these mega bankers who've written the laws, literally, they're lobbyists, to exempt them from taxes, lobbying to raise taxes on what's left of the middle class of this country.
[01:04:39.714 --> 01:04:40.555]  Absolute scam.
[01:04:40.575 --> 01:04:41.415]  You cut taxes,
[01:04:42.396 --> 01:04:50.367]  You cut the corporate welfare spending, you up at the regional level the infrastructure spending, and your country races forward.
[01:04:50.768 --> 01:04:51.929]  That's the American system.
[01:04:52.410 --> 01:04:53.011]  Kennedy did it.
[01:04:53.832 --> 01:04:54.873]  Tax revenues doubled.
[01:04:54.953 --> 01:04:57.717]  We'll be right back with Lyndon LaRouche with key information.
[01:04:57.737 --> 01:04:58.218]  Stay with us.
[01:05:01.002 --> 01:05:02.143]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:05:02.183 --> 01:05:08.849]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:05:09.110 --> 01:05:11.392]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:05:11.672 --> 01:05:16.837]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:05:17.037 --> 01:05:19.819]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:05:20.079 --> 01:05:22.180]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:28.324]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:05:28.644 --> 01:05:31.846]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:05:32.026 --> 01:05:37.549]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:05:37.810 --> 01:05:39.110]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:05:39.451 --> 01:05:40.611]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:05:40.751 --> 01:05:43.293]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:05:43.413 --> 01:05:44.834]  He explains everything you need to know.
[01:05:45.094 --> 01:05:47.457]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:05:47.638 --> 01:05:52.124]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:05:52.264 --> 01:05:54.727]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[01:05:58.713 --> 01:05:59.694]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:06:01.056 --> 01:06:04.098]  Congratulations to our friends at eFoodsDirect.com.

[01:06:16.445 --> 01:06:16.685]  I'm good.

[01:06:52.603 --> 01:06:54.484]  That's 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:07:01.832 --> 01:07:05.453]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:07:05.853 --> 01:07:08.854]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:07:09.094 --> 01:07:13.875]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:07:13.895 --> 01:07:20.137]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:07:20.277 --> 01:07:22.518]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:07:23.058 --> 01:07:23.338]  Tim Geithner?
[01:07:23.358 --> 01:07:23.778]  Bernanke?
[01:07:23.879 --> 01:07:24.639]  They're arsonists!
[01:07:24.679 --> 01:07:25.800]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:07:25.820 --> 01:07:28.061]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:07:41.949 --> 01:07:43.811]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:07:44.091 --> 01:07:48.857]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:07:49.237 --> 01:07:58.367]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:08:02.423 --> 01:08:08.449]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:09.049 --> 01:08:12.092]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:12.913 --> 01:08:16.296]  We're now eight minutes into hour number two for the rest of the hour.
[01:08:16.316 --> 01:08:20.220]  Lyndon LaRouche is our guest, just returned to the United States.
[01:08:21.385 --> 01:08:23.366]  LaRouchePAC.com is the website.
[01:08:23.446 --> 01:08:37.590]  Love him or hate him, he has accurately gauged the true history of the last 200 years in Western Europe, the Anglo-American British Empire taking over the United States through their Council on Foreign Relations Pratt House system.
[01:08:38.610 --> 01:08:42.373]  And really, no introduction is needed.
[01:08:42.473 --> 01:08:48.057]  If you don't know who Len LaRouche is, there's probably not much hope for you, but you can learn more at larouchepac.com.
[01:08:48.517 --> 01:08:53.420]  And again, whether you agree with their solutions, you can't disagree with their analysis.
[01:08:53.621 --> 01:08:59.805]  I studied source, globalist, and Anglo-American documents, and declassified CIA reports, and
[01:09:00.285 --> 01:09:05.727]  What he was talking about 20, 30, 40 years ago is exactly what's going on and who is running things.
[01:09:05.787 --> 01:09:10.008]  This is a command destruction of the Western world.
[01:09:10.428 --> 01:09:13.569]  The megabanks are waging war against the real economy.
[01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:20.692]  They are, that's what oligarchs do, they are knocking out all their competition, waging war against the sovereignty of this planet.
[01:09:21.072 --> 01:09:25.973]  And the endgame, world government's only the beginning, the endgame is global population reduction.
[01:09:26.273 --> 01:09:27.334]  We've got a report out today,
[01:09:28.514 --> 01:09:29.455]  They have a report out today.
[01:09:29.515 --> 01:09:35.497]  LaRouche, Jael Bernanke, Geithner and Obama, now for massive theft and loan fraud.
[01:09:35.517 --> 01:09:40.720]  And up on their website, they are saying right now, this just broke in the last 10 minutes.
[01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:42.841]  They've been able to analyze the actual plan.
[01:09:42.861 --> 01:09:45.622]  And again, we'll put their website back up on screen.
[01:09:46.042 --> 01:09:47.983]  And here's a report they sent to us minutes ago.
[01:09:48.343 --> 01:09:55.547]  Quote, we are now getting briefed that everything you read in the press on Senate-House agreement in the press is a lie.
[01:09:56.027 --> 01:09:58.489]  We are about to lose the United States and civilization.
[01:09:58.529 --> 01:09:59.950]  This was a Hitler-style coup.
[01:10:00.290 --> 01:10:02.632]  There is going to be Americans dead in the streets.
[01:10:03.032 --> 01:10:04.533]  We can still turn this around.
[01:10:04.613 --> 01:10:07.355]  Lynn will have more on the subject in the interview.
[01:10:07.436 --> 01:10:08.676]  Don, from their office.
[01:10:08.716 --> 01:10:12.880]  And if you go to their site, they have the big banner up there at the top saying this is a coup.
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:13.420]  And it is.
[01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:15.401]  It's an expansion of an economic coup.
[01:10:16.162 --> 01:10:18.724]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is also
[01:10:20.585 --> 01:10:26.548]  In the news, saying that this whole thing is a giant scam.
[01:10:26.568 --> 01:10:28.329]  Here's the headline at PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:10:28.729 --> 01:10:29.910]  Will the ceiling fall in?
[01:10:29.930 --> 01:10:33.072]  Disastrous outcomes from an orchestrated crisis.
[01:10:33.352 --> 01:10:42.096]  And so to look at what the plan really does, the tax increases, the slashing of benefits, so everything goes to the foreign bankers.
[01:10:42.136 --> 01:10:48.119]  We're going into a third world receivership and joining us to break it down is Linlin LaRouge.
[01:10:48.159 --> 01:10:49.000]  Linlin, thank you for joining us.
[01:10:51.196 --> 01:10:52.758]  So, bold statements here.
[01:10:52.778 --> 01:11:00.765]  I mean, we saw three years ago, Paulson say that if you don't give us unlimited trillions, there'll be martial law, blood in the streets.
[01:11:00.805 --> 01:11:04.988]  A month ago, same statements by the finance ministers of Europe, tanks, blood in the streets.
[01:11:05.349 --> 01:11:09.292]  But if you do go along with their plan, is that not where this leads?
[01:11:09.332 --> 01:11:11.334]  So, very bold statements out of your office.
[01:11:11.614 --> 01:11:14.197]  And I see behind you, stop the Obama-Hitler coup.
[01:11:14.577 --> 01:11:15.858]  Lena LaRouge, you've got the floor.
[01:11:15.898 --> 01:11:16.539]  What are we facing?
[01:11:17.139 --> 01:11:28.184]  We're facing right now the legislation which was pushed through by Obama recently is comparable to the Hitler-Mexican Gazettes, the law which made Hitler a dictator.
[01:11:28.824 --> 01:11:31.786]  It's actually worse than that because the conditions involved are bad.
[01:11:32.406 --> 01:11:36.908]  You have a number of foolish people in the United States, and I do say they're very foolish.
[01:11:37.648 --> 01:11:43.611]  They believe that only Wall Street offers them the opportunity for investment, that is people with money,
[01:11:44.449 --> 01:11:51.152]  And therefore they assume that if Obama is going to protect them, that they're going to have their money.
[01:11:51.952 --> 01:11:57.795]  The fact of the matter is, if Obama goes through with this policy, the entire economy of the United States will collapse.
[01:11:57.915 --> 01:12:07.279]  And with quite justice, those who supported Obama, because they wanted their own Wall Street money, will be the first to lose everything.
[01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:13.162]  So it's a case of foolish people who believe that their money is everything,
[01:12:13.931 --> 01:12:17.354]  And they're about to lose every bit of it if they continue.
[01:12:17.834 --> 01:12:32.444]  We have one day now, as of now, about one day removed from the confirmation of the Hitler-like law which was pushed through on a corrupted Congress by the President of the United States.
[01:12:33.265 --> 01:12:37.328]  If this war is not blocked now, within the next hours,
[01:12:38.337 --> 01:12:44.619]  Then the danger is the United States will no longer exist and the deaths in the streets will begin.
[01:12:44.639 --> 01:12:51.962]  Now, again, sir, these are bold statements from you.
[01:12:52.943 --> 01:12:57.424]  Break down the technicals of the agreement and your analysis and why you're saying this.
[01:12:57.484 --> 01:13:02.266]  I mean, what is really in this so-called agreement, Lyndon LaRouche?
[01:13:03.186 --> 01:13:07.428]  The agreement is that the President of the United States becomes a dictator.
[01:13:08.436 --> 01:13:12.537]  Just like the Hitler Law, which established the Hitler Dictatorship.
[01:13:13.797 --> 01:13:23.519]  And if you actually vote up the confirmation of this law, which is pushed through by the President on his initiative, you are a slave.
[01:13:24.299 --> 01:13:26.299]  And you're going to start dying fast.
[01:13:26.759 --> 01:13:35.861]  And those foolish people who supported the President's Law because he thought he was going to protect their Wall Street investments, because they believe their only Wall Street investments are available to them.
[01:13:36.536 --> 01:13:40.419]  Therefore they defend him because they're stupid.
[01:13:40.939 --> 01:13:42.881]  They think they're going to preserve their investments.
[01:13:42.901 --> 01:13:48.605]  The first thing that's going to happen is they're going to be bankrupted and in the streets dying like the rest of us.
[01:13:50.854 --> 01:14:09.748]  Now I'm digging out the article, but I remember some of the different presidential decision directives of Bush four years ago, saying for any emergency, including economic, the president can set aside Congress for six months, and then when congressmen and others ask for the full text,
[01:14:10.428 --> 01:14:12.611]  They were told it was classified even to Congress.
[01:14:12.651 --> 01:14:19.399]  That made national news and we reported on it here heavily and I'm digging out the actual PDDs here in a moment.
[01:14:19.439 --> 01:14:21.101]  It's in my stack from yesterday's show.
[01:14:21.842 --> 01:14:26.067]  I alluded to it, but I only saw the three or four different plans.
[01:14:26.248 --> 01:14:28.510]  I haven't had time yet because they just released it.
[01:14:29.071 --> 01:14:32.652]  to see the supposed agreement, and they're not even releasing all of that.
[01:14:32.712 --> 01:14:38.614]  You're saying you've looked in this, Mr. LaRouche, and you're saying it has the dictatorial power?
[01:14:38.634 --> 01:14:51.259]  Because I know two weeks ago, the leader of the Republicans in the Senate from Kentucky, the senator did come out and say, let's give the president the power of the purse, and that was being debated.
[01:14:51.739 --> 01:14:53.259]  Also, other powers.
[01:14:53.599 --> 01:14:54.800]  Are you saying that that's in there?
[01:14:55.660 --> 01:14:56.340]  That's all in there.
[01:14:56.961 --> 01:15:02.184]  The point is the law is very simple, and they don't put out the real interesting parts of the law.
[01:15:04.346 --> 01:15:09.349]  My associates have tech checked with the leading members of Congress, those circles.
[01:15:09.930 --> 01:15:13.072]  There is no doubt of what this is, as I've described it.
[01:15:13.432 --> 01:15:18.896]  There is no difference between the actual law and in terms of its implementation.
[01:15:19.634 --> 01:15:29.460]  And the only condition now is we have a very short time to force the President and force the Congress to withdraw support for that law.
[01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:35.903]  If the Congress does not act to withdraw, you're going to sign death in the street.
[01:15:36.063 --> 01:15:49.151]  It's going to begin very quickly because the cuts which are being proposed on the American people under the present conditions and the fact a sudden collapse in two phases
[01:15:50.387 --> 01:15:52.048]  No, look out the streets now.
[01:15:52.689 --> 01:15:53.910]  Look at the conditions of life.
[01:15:54.010 --> 01:15:55.170]  Look at what's happened to health care.
[01:15:55.190 --> 01:15:56.031]  Look at other things.
[01:15:56.171 --> 01:16:03.696]  Every form of metal at grave sites, railways, stop signs, everything's being stolen.
[01:16:04.057 --> 01:16:07.539]  Crime is exploding and they're telling us the economy's recovered and is wonderful.
[01:16:07.959 --> 01:16:08.360]  When what?
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:15.084]  We're over three years into a depression according to every economic barometer.
[01:16:15.225 --> 01:16:19.788]  Three quarters of continued loss of growth.
[01:16:20.748 --> 01:16:21.128]  It's worse.
[01:16:21.528 --> 01:16:21.948]  It's worse.
[01:16:22.009 --> 01:16:23.609]  We are now at the endgame.
[01:16:24.129 --> 01:16:27.070]  The money they think they have is absolutely worthless.
[01:16:27.611 --> 01:16:31.732]  You have to look at the quadrillions of so-called pretended assets out there.
[01:16:32.112 --> 01:16:33.473]  They're not worth anything.
[01:16:34.093 --> 01:16:36.034]  They're paper that could never be redeemed.
[01:16:37.274 --> 01:16:46.558]  What this is, is simply the British Empire, which runs the United States and Wall Street right now, with their puppet president, Obama.
[01:16:47.079 --> 01:16:48.502]  So this is an economic black hole that they got
[01:17:00.791 --> 01:17:03.954]  Rid of the Glass-Steagall, as you reported on and predicted all of this 12 years ago.
[01:17:04.454 --> 01:17:09.398]  Clinton, then Bush, and now Obama have all followed the same program.
[01:17:09.738 --> 01:17:14.643]  Of course it's impossible for us to ever pay off 1.5 quadrillion that we didn't even make.
[01:17:14.943 --> 01:17:21.588]  The very central banks that created this fraud and had us sign on to it are now posing as our saviors.
[01:17:21.648 --> 01:17:23.430]  This is insane.
[01:17:23.470 --> 01:17:25.772]  For anyone who's halfway educated about economics,
[01:17:26.312 --> 01:17:30.694]  It is like having Hitler preside as the head judge at a Nuremberg trial.
[01:17:31.035 --> 01:17:35.477]  It is the height of bizarre, Kafka-esque weirdness.
[01:17:36.317 --> 01:17:39.359]  This is an act of treason by this president.
[01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:48.805]  He was acting on behalf of a foreign power to conduct an action which will destroy the United States.
[01:17:49.385 --> 01:17:50.346]  That is treason.
[01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:12.381]  Exactly.
[01:18:12.901 --> 01:18:14.662]  He is the Hitler dictator.
[01:18:15.862 --> 01:18:18.304]  This guy is the equivalent of Adolf Hitler.
[01:18:18.744 --> 01:18:23.646]  And like Adolf Hitler, who was created by the British Empire, he's created by the same thing.
[01:18:24.266 --> 01:18:26.027]  This guy should never have been president.
[01:18:26.728 --> 01:18:33.551]  He was not qualified to become president because of the fraud he committed under the British support to make him president.
[01:18:34.632 --> 01:18:37.233]  Through the phony, you know, the crowd there.
[01:18:37.633 --> 01:18:38.494]  This is all there.
[01:18:38.534 --> 01:18:39.274]  It's all on the map.
[01:18:39.904 --> 01:18:45.089]  But once we see what we had, you look at the vote of the American people, what the tendency is in France.
[01:18:45.890 --> 01:18:47.972]  The people are not going to other parties.
[01:18:48.392 --> 01:18:50.334]  They're abandoning the Democratic Party and the...
[01:18:52.042 --> 01:18:53.803]  We just lost his Skype connection.
[01:18:53.843 --> 01:18:55.544]  We're going to get him connected again.
[01:18:55.824 --> 01:18:56.765]  And that is in the news.
[01:18:57.325 --> 01:19:00.347]  In fact, I have the headlines here where it is a total revolt.
[01:19:00.907 --> 01:19:12.514]  They have live time analysis of what's happening and they're reporting plunging support for Boehner and Obama.
[01:19:13.135 --> 01:19:14.696]  People really see through this.
[01:19:15.596 --> 01:19:18.800]  And as the Chinese and others have said, they've already defaulted.
[01:19:19.340 --> 01:19:30.292]  If we don't say no to the derivatives, if we don't disconnect ourselves from that black hole, it is impossible hundreds of times over to ever pay this off.
[01:19:30.352 --> 01:19:31.313]  We don't owe it.
[01:19:31.954 --> 01:19:33.855]  It's admitted in Ireland, in Greece, and other countries.
[01:19:33.895 --> 01:19:35.596]  They don't owe 90 plus percent.
[01:19:35.656 --> 01:19:39.218]  It's like 92, 93, depending on the country, of the money that's owed is not owed.
[01:19:39.698 --> 01:19:46.362]  We're talking about thousands of trillions they say we owe, and we're having debates about 14 and a half trillion, and all of these discussions.
[01:19:47.302 --> 01:19:57.110]  Again, they want to destroy the economy, just like the article I read earlier, where they're going to bulldoze homes nationwide instead of letting housing prices go down, and then give people homes that they can afford.
[01:19:57.551 --> 01:19:59.993]  We'll be right back with Lennon LaRouche.
[01:20:00.013 --> 01:20:01.053]  We're getting reconnected via Skype.

[01:22:00.353 --> 01:22:04.576]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:22:04.896 --> 01:22:05.516]  Number one.
[01:22:05.797 --> 01:22:08.959]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:22:09.239 --> 01:22:09.799]  Number two.
[01:22:10.099 --> 01:22:14.642]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:22:14.982 --> 01:22:15.423]  It's true.
[01:22:15.723 --> 01:22:20.286]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:22:20.586 --> 01:22:21.126]  Number 3.
[01:22:21.407 --> 01:22:24.709]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:22:25.009 --> 01:22:28.752]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:22:28.912 --> 01:22:29.172]  Number 4.
[01:22:29.712 --> 01:22:32.094]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:22:32.474 --> 01:22:35.856]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:22:36.157 --> 01:22:36.357]  Number 5.
[01:22:36.937 --> 01:22:40.840]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:45.844]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:22:46.124 --> 01:22:50.167]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:23:00.055 --> 01:23:02.375]  Big Berkey water filters are in high demand.
[01:23:02.576 --> 01:23:04.396]  Storable foods are also in high demand.

[01:23:09.657 --> 01:23:13.078]  But increasingly, our customers have been asking for storable foods.

[01:24:13.853 --> 01:24:20.378]  Okay, Video Skype is...
[01:24:38.211 --> 01:24:43.676]  An absolutely incredible technology, but it also has a problem.
[01:24:43.716 --> 01:24:46.759]  So we're going to audio Skype as soon as we can get Leonard LaRouche back on.
[01:24:46.779 --> 01:24:51.843]  And Zero Heads reported on this over the weekend on July 31st.
[01:24:51.943 --> 01:24:53.765]  Yesterday, we reported on it.
[01:24:53.805 --> 01:25:00.831]  Of course, in the last five, four and a half years, this is almost five years ago that Bush put these into place, Obama reauthorized them.
[01:25:01.992 --> 01:25:17.881]  Headline, Obama's Final Loophole, the Catastrophic Emergency Clause, and it goes on to break it down, National Security Presidential Directive, NSPD 51, and Homeland Security Presidential Directive, HSPD 20.
[01:25:19.184 --> 01:25:29.472]  And we actually cover this in my film, Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, where you have the head of the Homeland Security Committee in the House saying, I've been asking for several months to see the full text of this.
[01:25:30.613 --> 01:25:41.481]  The three-page boil-down, the cover sheet, says it makes the President a dictator for six months, when he implements this, and that Congress basically is powerless for any emergency, including economic.
[01:25:42.141 --> 01:25:45.043]  So I want to see it, and he was never allowed to see it.
[01:25:46.645 --> 01:25:48.026]  Who was that, DeFazio at the time?
[01:25:49.127 --> 01:25:51.168]  Point is, we played those clips many times.
[01:25:51.768 --> 01:26:00.353]  So this is going on, this is happening, and I'm seeing a lot of different reports because what they're saying is, well, there's not really anything you can see.
[01:26:00.893 --> 01:26:12.679]  The Republicans and Democrats are agreeing to nebulous $2.5 trillion cuts that start sometime next year through the next 10, and we're going to have a committee, a new commission, that decides all of this.
[01:26:13.679 --> 01:26:17.942]  And so that right there is the proof, as Lyndon LaRouche said, that it's all nebulous.
[01:26:17.962 --> 01:26:27.828]  They're not saying, but then you go to what they've been saying the last few weeks, that, oh, he could just use the presidential directives, and you see what different Republican leaders said, let's just give Obama the power.
[01:26:28.208 --> 01:26:35.192]  Lyndon LaRouche, who, former CIA director back in the 80s, I know you can pull up the quotes, said he has one of the best private intelligence networks out there.
[01:26:35.532 --> 01:26:38.134]  The head of the National Security Council said the same thing about LaRouche.
[01:26:38.394 --> 01:26:42.757]  He really does have those contacts there in D.C., and he says that they're telling him
[01:26:43.177 --> 01:26:49.818]  That the reason it's nebulous and you can't find out the details is because it is a dictatorial handover of power.
[01:26:49.978 --> 01:26:55.280]  This is a short segment, sir, a long segment coming up, but break down what your sources on Capitol Hill are telling you.
[01:27:00.661 --> 01:27:04.021]  Well, the point is that it's just exactly that.
[01:27:05.122 --> 01:27:06.862]  What you find is you find a layer
[01:27:07.705 --> 01:27:12.607]  of propositions and agreements which are used to confuse the people who don't know what's going on.
[01:27:13.147 --> 01:27:23.132]  People in the Senate, for example, the leading circles of the Senate, and I believe also the House of Representatives, but I'm not so sure there, but in the Senate at least, they know what is happening.
[01:27:23.972 --> 01:27:36.598]  And they are influenced very strongly by the fact that their clientele, which has money, is very important for both them personally and also for their political influence in society.
[01:27:37.446 --> 01:27:40.368]  So therefore, they allow themselves to be deluded.
[01:27:40.869 --> 01:27:43.631]  Even if they're not malicious in their intention, and I know some of these people.
[01:27:44.051 --> 01:27:45.492]  They're not malicious in their intention.
[01:27:45.912 --> 01:27:46.593]  They're just greedy.
[01:27:47.333 --> 01:27:54.699]  And they believe that if we don't support this thing, that the President will take actions which will wipe out their money, their investment.
[01:27:55.239 --> 01:27:58.342]  But the fact of the matter is, their investment is already worthless.
[01:27:59.182 --> 01:28:02.545]  It's only worth the belief that it has value.
[01:28:03.197 --> 01:28:16.660]  You look at the figures, or the money, you look at the amount of value that we are producing in the United States and in other countries, and you look at the amount of money we say we have, or the people say they have, and you realize the whole thing is a fraud.
[01:28:17.501 --> 01:28:20.261]  What we need to do is go to a Glass-Steagall Act.
[01:28:20.941 --> 01:28:23.782]  The same one that President Roosevelt put in effect in 1973.
[01:28:24.462 --> 01:28:25.243]  Just back to that.
[01:28:25.803 --> 01:28:26.523]  What that would do,
[01:28:27.316 --> 01:28:37.682]  We take all the money, which is called money but is not really wealth, and we put it into a separate account, for which the government itself would not be responsible.
[01:28:38.602 --> 01:28:51.650]  Then the money that conformed to the law, what had been the actual constitutional law, the original constitution, and what was the law established by 1933, Glass-Steagall, that law would click into effect.
[01:28:51.890 --> 01:28:55.212]  Under those conditions, with the credit now released,
[01:28:55.914 --> 01:29:00.978]  Available to the United States government, we could start an immediate recovery tomorrow morning.
[01:29:02.019 --> 01:29:03.821]  And if they don't know how to do it, I know how to do it.
[01:29:04.801 --> 01:29:07.243]  Lennon LaRouche, you predicted all this.
[01:29:07.263 --> 01:29:07.744]  We're going to break.
[01:29:07.764 --> 01:29:12.047]  We're going to come back and get into solutions, and then some phone calls.
[01:29:12.087 --> 01:29:19.634]  But first, as we go to break here, why are you saying this is going to cause economic collapse very quickly?
[01:29:19.994 --> 01:29:24.398]  What is the time frame of the accelerating collapse if they don't reverse this?
[01:29:28.500 --> 01:29:29.481]  I'll tell you what, stay there.
[01:29:29.501 --> 01:29:36.065]  We're just going to come back to you after the break with that important question with Leonard LaRouche, because the outro music cuts out his Skype connection.
[01:29:36.386 --> 01:29:37.807]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:29:37.827 --> 01:29:40.248]  On the other side, I'm Alex Jones with Infowars.com.
[01:29:40.709 --> 01:29:46.232]  And of course, we're simulcasting the radio show right now in living video color at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:29:46.612 --> 01:29:47.393]  Please stay with us.
[01:29:51.236 --> 01:29:52.136]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.637 --> 01:29:54.138]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.151 --> 01:29:57.892]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.953 --> 01:30:03.473]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:30:03.673 --> 01:30:08.715]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:30:08.995 --> 01:30:10.355]  Saving means to make money.
[01:30:10.535 --> 01:30:19.298]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:30:20.038 --> 01:30:27.143]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:30:27.583 --> 01:30:35.188]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:30:35.588 --> 01:30:40.511]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:30:40.811 --> 01:30:42.972]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[01:31:00.435 --> 01:31:04.678]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:31:04.978 --> 01:31:05.259]  Number 1.
[01:31:05.899 --> 01:31:09.061]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:09.322 --> 01:31:09.882]  Number 2.
[01:31:10.182 --> 01:31:14.746]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:31:15.086 --> 01:31:15.526]  It's true.
[01:31:15.826 --> 01:31:20.390]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:20.690 --> 01:31:21.230]  Number 3.
[01:31:21.531 --> 01:31:24.813]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:31:25.113 --> 01:31:28.796]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:29.016 --> 01:31:29.557]  Number 4.
[01:31:29.797 --> 01:31:32.179]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:31:32.559 --> 01:31:35.943]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:31:36.243 --> 01:31:36.783]  Number 5.
[01:31:37.044 --> 01:31:40.947]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:31:41.187 --> 01:31:45.952]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:31:46.232 --> 01:31:50.253]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:50.393 --> 01:31:51.933]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:52.193 --> 01:31:54.253]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:31:54.413 --> 01:31:57.034]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:31:57.054 --> 01:32:06.115]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:32:07.356 --> 01:32:12.116]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:32:12.497 --> 01:32:14.357]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[01:32:16.567 --> 01:32:27.392]  Well they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you love the way they fit
[01:32:39.375 --> 01:32:41.256]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:32:41.516 --> 01:32:43.017]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:32:43.297 --> 01:32:45.858]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:32:46.178 --> 01:32:52.441]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:32:52.801 --> 01:32:55.002]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:32:55.502 --> 01:32:57.543]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[01:32:57.883 --> 01:32:58.384]  Others don't.
[01:33:34.468 --> 01:33:44.321]  We are back live with Lennon LaRouche, and he's got a long track record of accurately predicting exactly what's going on.
[01:33:44.361 --> 01:33:52.411]  You can, again, disagree with some of their political ideas, but their analysis has been very accurate, and I hope they're wrong.
[01:33:53.172 --> 01:33:58.796]  Unfortunately, we've seen the total positioning of the federalization of every state, every county, every city.
[01:33:59.297 --> 01:34:04.581]  We've seen a covert rollout of military and police to, quote, crack down the American people.
[01:34:05.081 --> 01:34:08.764]  Three years ago, they said they wanted to have tens of thousands of U.S.
[01:34:08.804 --> 01:34:12.066]  troops ready for an economic collapse by the second half of 2011.
[01:34:12.287 --> 01:34:14.808]  That was the Army Times.
[01:34:15.329 --> 01:34:20.553]  Something this big, you can always see the scripting and the setup and the buildup for it.
[01:34:21.053 --> 01:34:23.514]  And it is a giant attack on the Republic.
[01:34:23.914 --> 01:34:25.515]  And so, Lyndon LaRouche, you've got the floor, sir.
[01:34:25.555 --> 01:34:26.235]  Please roll with it.
[01:34:27.836 --> 01:34:33.918]  Why you're saying this collapse will totally implode the country, and what's the timeframe?
[01:34:35.859 --> 01:34:36.939]  The timeframe is immediate.
[01:34:38.277 --> 01:34:40.079]  We are at the tail end of the thing.
[01:34:40.439 --> 01:34:45.002]  For example, look at it from the standpoint of the re-enactment of Glass-Steagall.
[01:34:45.022 --> 01:34:46.543]  Glass-Steagall is now on the agenda.
[01:34:46.803 --> 01:34:52.327]  It's already going in with increasing support among members of the Congress for its enactment.
[01:34:53.067 --> 01:35:02.954]  Were it enacted today, and were this crazy law of Obama not in force, then we would be on the road to recovery.
[01:35:03.928 --> 01:35:09.451]  Because the United States system, remember, we were bankrupt when we had won the war against the British.
[01:35:10.332 --> 01:35:16.575]  But with the reform, which was inspired by our Treasury Secretary at the time, we adopted a constitution.
[01:35:17.436 --> 01:35:21.798]  And this constitution said we don't believe in a money system, we believe in a credit system.
[01:35:22.578 --> 01:35:30.583]  And that the what we should do is to solve the debts we had as war debts, we should be able to pay them off by issuing
[01:35:34.275 --> 01:35:34.555]  We're good.
[01:35:51.252 --> 01:35:57.395]  And every time we've gone back to this principle of economy, we have prospered while the rest of the world is in a disaster.
[01:35:57.575 --> 01:35:58.096]  Look at us!
[01:35:58.876 --> 01:35:59.957]  We went through the Civil War.
[01:35:59.997 --> 01:36:01.057]  It was the British organized.
[01:36:01.498 --> 01:36:04.159]  It almost destroyed us, in terms of the cost of it.
[01:36:04.739 --> 01:36:18.927]  But then, because of the great unleashing of productive power in agriculture and industry, and also these structures like railways and so forth, this made us the most powerful nation in the world in economics, of any nation.
[01:36:20.047 --> 01:36:22.309]  We did it again several times.
[01:36:22.549 --> 01:36:24.070]  We did it under Franklin Roosevelt.
[01:36:24.711 --> 01:36:25.632]  We can do it again.
[01:36:26.272 --> 01:36:34.218]  The same system going back to our Constitution, our federal Constitution, which is based on the principle of credit rather than money.
[01:36:34.799 --> 01:36:38.402]  Sir, can you quantify that for those that don't understand?
[01:36:39.182 --> 01:36:53.730]  Since 1913, we went off the American system and allowed private banking families to be paid interest for the government to have the right to have a currency when currency is only a symbol of exchange and is tied to the overall productivity of the country.
[01:36:54.630 --> 01:36:58.752]  And I remember reading the quotes by the big banking families of Europe, the Rothschilds and others.
[01:36:59.212 --> 01:37:00.593]  It was in British newspapers.
[01:37:00.613 --> 01:37:05.836]  I've read the editorial saying if this American system spreads, we are
[01:37:06.736 --> 01:37:13.623]  Our global empire is going to die, and so that's why they tried to break the country up under Jackson, you know, against Jackson.
[01:37:13.643 --> 01:37:15.424]  They tried to break it up during the Civil War.
[01:37:15.725 --> 01:37:17.266]  I mean, this was a public debate.
[01:37:17.326 --> 01:37:21.990]  This was talked about all over the world, and we've forgotten history, so we're reliving it.
[01:37:22.010 --> 01:37:24.353]  And a great example of this is Time Magazine says,
[01:37:25.874 --> 01:37:28.196]  They're going to bulldoze most of the foreclosed houses.
[01:37:28.236 --> 01:37:29.777]  They've bulldozed tens of thousands.
[01:37:30.077 --> 01:37:36.642]  Now they want to bulldoze hundreds of thousands to jack up prices by destroying productivity and infrastructure.
[01:37:37.042 --> 01:37:41.346]  I mean, that is the monetarist system, correct?
[01:37:41.386 --> 01:37:41.926]  That's right.
[01:37:42.306 --> 01:37:43.627]  And this is what you're looking at.
[01:37:43.707 --> 01:37:45.749]  What happened to the auto industry?
[01:37:46.489 --> 01:37:48.191]  What happened to the agricultural system?
[01:37:48.551 --> 01:37:52.494]  The fact we're not now producing enough food to meet the requirements of our people next year?
[01:37:52.934 --> 01:37:55.316]  The fact that the destitution of most of our people
[01:37:57.270 --> 01:37:57.731]  We're good to go.
[01:38:20.943 --> 01:38:21.604]  We have the choice.
[01:38:21.964 --> 01:38:32.211]  These guys, who represent a foreign interest, centered in London, are out to destroy us, because we're the greatest danger they are, that exists to them, for them.
[01:38:33.632 --> 01:38:35.493]  Therefore, we need patriots.
[01:38:36.494 --> 01:38:37.795]  Look at the citizens out there.
[01:38:38.235 --> 01:38:39.916]  They're turning against both parties.
[01:38:39.956 --> 01:38:41.157]  They hate both parties.
[01:38:41.237 --> 01:38:42.878]  They hate the leadership of both parties.
[01:38:43.298 --> 01:38:44.419]  But they're not doing anything.
[01:38:44.519 --> 01:38:44.739]  Why?
[01:38:45.180 --> 01:38:46.861]  They hate the parties.
[01:38:47.521 --> 01:38:48.802]  They hate the government.
[01:38:49.574 --> 01:38:51.657]  And they have every damn good reason to do that.
[01:38:51.938 --> 01:38:52.779]  Well, sure.
[01:38:52.799 --> 01:38:54.121]  Our job is to be patriots.
[01:38:55.839 --> 01:39:02.841]  Okay, so from your research, you're saying this is going to accelerate the implosion, they've been denying we're in a depression, now they're basically admitting it.
[01:39:04.681 --> 01:39:10.643]  We've put up the quotes there where they say if we don't basically do whatever they say, we're going to have a depression, but we're already in one.
[01:39:11.903 --> 01:39:19.605]  What is the globalist slash British, what is this New World Order, which is really the old world order model, what are they planning?
[01:39:19.705 --> 01:39:20.965]  Why do they want to do this?
[01:39:21.326 --> 01:39:22.446]  Why do they want to
[01:39:23.326 --> 01:39:29.369]  Have a global corporate takeover of every sovereign nation and fully bankrupt it and destroy the society.
[01:39:29.389 --> 01:39:32.190]  I mean, anybody who thinks that they're done, think again.
[01:39:32.210 --> 01:39:34.251]  They're only accelerating their carbon taxes.
[01:39:34.271 --> 01:39:40.713]  They're only, you know, the head of the Economic Council at the White House is moving General Electric's x-ray division to China.
[01:39:42.434 --> 01:39:43.654]  General Motors bailout.
[01:39:43.955 --> 01:39:46.235]  Billions of dollars to move our plants overseas.
[01:39:46.336 --> 01:39:48.076]  I mean, it is flagrant
[01:39:50.117 --> 01:39:53.800]  Treason, economic sabotage on steroids.
[01:39:53.860 --> 01:39:54.721]  It's so naked.
[01:39:56.423 --> 01:39:57.504]  Look at the very fact.
[01:39:58.885 --> 01:40:00.066]  Look at our world production.
[01:40:00.246 --> 01:40:06.451]  What's the policy of the reigning political forces inside Europe and inside the United States today?
[01:40:07.032 --> 01:40:11.836]  Their policy is not only zero growth, zero population growth.
[01:40:12.196 --> 01:40:15.219]  Their policy today is to reduce the world's population.
[01:40:16.027 --> 01:40:17.568]  To one billion people.
[01:40:18.208 --> 01:40:22.511]  That is the officially stated policy of the British Empire.
[01:40:23.011 --> 01:40:25.433]  It's a stated policy of many of the environmentalists.
[01:40:26.173 --> 01:40:27.954]  It's a stated policy of many others.
[01:40:28.435 --> 01:40:30.236]  This is what is happening to us.
[01:40:31.296 --> 01:40:33.057]  And we have to look at that fact.
[01:40:33.498 --> 01:40:34.979]  Look at the American people.
[01:40:35.759 --> 01:40:39.021]  Look at what they have now and what they had, say, two years ago.
[01:40:39.361 --> 01:40:41.623]  Look at what they had under John F. Kennedy.
[01:40:42.423 --> 01:40:45.645]  Look what they lost when his brother was also assassinated.
[01:40:46.437 --> 01:40:47.558]  They got their own way.
[01:40:48.078 --> 01:40:54.080]  They got a useless war in Indochina which weakened us and destroyed us by killing Kennedy because he was opposed to that war.
[01:40:54.901 --> 01:41:01.783]  They killed his brother, who was about to become nominated the presidential candidate for the Democratic Party, because he represented the same thing.
[01:41:02.964 --> 01:41:05.405]  We have to look at the physical reality.
[01:41:06.265 --> 01:41:10.667]  Because the economy is nothing but a correlative of physical reality.
[01:41:11.367 --> 01:41:12.268]  And that's what we're losing.
[01:41:13.653 --> 01:41:17.856]  And the global banking cartel, they are literally parasites.
[01:41:18.116 --> 01:41:29.483]  They are waging war against the real economy because at any time the unlimited cornucopia, the engine of liberty, can be turned loose and will overthrow them.
[01:41:29.503 --> 01:41:37.908]  But as Thomas Jefferson said, if you ever let private banks control the issuance of currency and credit, your children will wake up homeless on the continent their forefathers conquered.
[01:41:39.037 --> 01:41:39.858]  This time it's worse.
[01:41:40.318 --> 01:41:43.800]  This is worse than anything our predecessors have ever imagined.
[01:41:44.401 --> 01:41:57.409]  The attempt to take a population in the order of seven billion people on this planet and to reduce it to one and do it in a fast order, which is what is being done now, is the greatest crime against humanity imaginable.
[01:41:57.729 --> 01:42:02.672]  As a matter of fact, this is the one kind of policy pushed by President Obama
[01:42:03.413 --> 01:42:06.775]  Which would cause the ultimate extinction of the human species.
[01:42:07.376 --> 01:42:16.561]  Because we're getting into a condition in the galaxy, which we're in a part, of a new kill ratio of species, like the killing of the dinosaurs.
[01:42:17.142 --> 01:42:23.166]  We as human beings are capable of developing the means to defend our population against such catastrophes.
[01:42:24.178 --> 01:42:40.917]  By the way, you were the first guy, I actually heard the claim years ago and went and looked it up, it's true, you're the first person on record to call for some type of planetary asteroid defense and then what, out of that, then the plan for SDI?
[01:42:42.609 --> 01:42:44.290]  Sure, that was my baby.
[01:42:44.670 --> 01:42:53.176]  What happened is I made the proposal in 1977 on the basis of my discussion with some leading people in the military and other circles.
[01:42:53.696 --> 01:43:03.723]  Our point was that a world war fought with the kinds of weapons which we in the Soviet Union were developing at that time would have caused a virtual extermination of the human species.
[01:43:04.344 --> 01:43:12.389]  So therefore the question was how to get a negotiation, particularly with the Soviet Union, under which we could control things so this wouldn't happen.
[01:43:13.130 --> 01:43:23.713]  So I came up with this thing and pushed it and I found a number of people in the United States and key positions of the old OSS crowd as well who came around to my support.
[01:43:24.321 --> 01:43:32.326]  Then I got support for, you know, I'd been leading military forces in Germany, the retired military force, senior ones, in France, in Italy, and other countries.
[01:43:32.846 --> 01:43:37.669]  I had leading military, and also a whole section of the Soviet Union, which agreed that I was right.
[01:43:37.889 --> 01:43:40.611]  By the way, folks, what he's talking about is even in the Washington Post.
[01:43:40.631 --> 01:43:41.652]  Lenin LaRouche really did.
[01:43:41.672 --> 01:43:45.754]  He used to land at the CIA base in Laney in his helicopter to go brief them.
[01:43:46.034 --> 01:43:51.258]  And then, of course, Bush, George W., Herbert Walker got jealous and set him up and put him in jail.
[01:43:52.038 --> 01:43:53.739]  But just incredible.
[01:43:53.939 --> 01:44:02.963]  But I mean, you're here saying, because I've noticed in the news, they're saying, well, they're agreeing to give it to a blue ribbon committee and let the president kind of have the authority.
[01:44:03.243 --> 01:44:10.266]  And they've had Mitch McConnell from Kentucky spin it that, well, like he said two weeks ago, we'll just let the president do this.
[01:44:10.626 --> 01:44:15.249]  Well, Congress can't hand the power of the purse over to the president or some committee.
[01:44:15.269 --> 01:44:18.090]  I mean, it's not their power to give up.
[01:44:18.570 --> 01:44:24.875]  Just like Congress couldn't treasonously give their power up to, say, the Chinese if they wanted to, or the Venezuelans.
[01:44:24.915 --> 01:44:28.518]  I mean, this really is treason, and they just do it out in the open.
[01:44:29.618 --> 01:44:30.299]  Of course it's treason.
[01:44:30.940 --> 01:44:31.720]  It's absolute treason.
[01:44:32.421 --> 01:44:37.024]  They know what they're doing, but they're part of a faction that thinks that they're going to prosper.
[01:44:37.444 --> 01:44:40.247]  And they're the first ones that are going to go under the axe when it happens.
[01:44:41.247 --> 01:44:46.992]  And, unfortunately, a lot of other decent citizens who are now starving to death, virtually, are also in the axe.
[01:44:47.788 --> 01:44:50.329]  We, my commitment is to my American people.
[01:44:50.629 --> 01:44:54.031]  Well let me say this, Lyndon, and then I want to hear some more from you and go to some calls.
[01:44:54.051 --> 01:44:59.933]  We appreciate all your time and hopefully because we had a few breakups on the connection, stay a little bit in the next hour so we can take more calls.
[01:45:00.394 --> 01:45:02.214]  But I know you're very busy today.
[01:45:04.452 --> 01:45:19.906]  Why would what's left of the ruling class that isn't part of the British aristocracy and the Rothschilds and Rockefellers, who have always been deeply in bed together to the point of where the Astors and others even took on affected British accents, as you know, 60, 70 years ago it was the big fad.
[01:45:23.189 --> 01:45:28.414]  On the East Coast, I mean this is, and we're not blaming the British people, we're blaming that imperial system that controls it.
[01:45:28.774 --> 01:45:34.739]  Why would what's left of independent wealth and others, and even the structure, allow this to be done?
[01:45:34.779 --> 01:45:36.721]  Because it does create great instability.
[01:45:37.362 --> 01:45:40.004]  It endangers the ruling class, for my research, even more.
[01:45:40.364 --> 01:45:42.106]  I mean, this is a snake eating itself.
[01:45:43.087 --> 01:45:48.972]  When they know the derivatives are 1.5 quadrillion and growing conservatively, it's impossible to ever pay off.
[01:45:49.232 --> 01:45:50.353]  You've got to write it off.
[01:45:50.753 --> 01:45:53.655]  Why are they going to feed everything into this vortex?
[01:45:54.116 --> 01:45:59.379]  I mean, at a subconscious level, is it just that these psychopaths like to destroy things?
[01:45:59.459 --> 01:46:01.241]  That they like to play God?
[01:46:01.261 --> 01:46:07.986]  I would say psychopaths is a miserable term, but I would say sociopaths is more accurate.
[01:46:08.946 --> 01:46:13.950]  We have a class, which we've known in European experience, for example, called the oligarchical principle.
[01:46:14.634 --> 01:46:18.677]  The Babylon was the oligarchical principle.
[01:46:19.218 --> 01:46:20.399]  We had the Roman Empire.
[01:46:20.539 --> 01:46:22.821]  We had the Byzantine Empire.
[01:46:23.101 --> 01:46:24.722]  We had the so-called Crusader system.
[01:46:25.103 --> 01:46:27.064]  Then we had the new British system.
[01:46:29.006 --> 01:46:32.629]  And these things were all based on what's called the oligarchical principle.
[01:46:33.249 --> 01:46:37.633]  They believe they've got to keep people stupid and dumb so they can use them.
[01:46:38.388 --> 01:46:39.789]  And that they have privileges.
[01:46:39.969 --> 01:46:42.550]  That they are a superior species that has privileges.
[01:46:43.131 --> 01:46:46.152]  It is a very limited part of the total population of this planet.
[01:46:46.753 --> 01:46:52.996]  But they happen to have controlling influence over the political institutions of this planet.
[01:46:53.716 --> 01:46:55.617]  And they rule it as they ruled over Africa.
[01:46:55.958 --> 01:46:57.078]  They commit genocide.
[01:46:57.118 --> 01:46:58.339]  They do it again and again.
[01:46:58.359 --> 01:47:00.520]  This is not new as a policy.
[01:47:00.900 --> 01:47:03.642]  The only difference now is they've come to the point
[01:47:04.406 --> 01:47:08.648]  That if they continue with this policy, the human species will become extinct.
[01:47:09.708 --> 01:47:10.349]  That's the difference.
[01:47:10.749 --> 01:47:14.811]  Well, they're building giant bunkers and huge seed vaults and building up for that.
[01:47:14.851 --> 01:47:16.031]  I mean, it's clearly planned.
[01:47:17.212 --> 01:47:24.315]  Can you go through, if this isn't reversed, how they're going to roll out their extermination program?
[01:47:25.276 --> 01:47:26.216]  They don't know themselves.
[01:47:26.876 --> 01:47:30.378]  What they're doing, you're talking about people who are intrinsically evil.
[01:47:31.477 --> 01:47:35.718]  And they don't think about anything except supporting the cause of evil.
[01:47:37.219 --> 01:47:39.600]  Our problem is not to fuss for them.
[01:47:40.180 --> 01:47:41.260]  Our problem is to overthrow them.
[01:47:41.900 --> 01:47:45.561]  Our problem in our case is to re-establish our constitution.
[01:47:46.122 --> 01:47:47.682]  To re-establish our system of government.
[01:47:48.362 --> 01:47:50.323]  And help other nations do the same thing for them.
[01:47:51.084 --> 01:47:54.106]  We have to get to a system of cooperation among nation states.
[01:47:54.426 --> 01:48:12.436]  But if we don't know how evil, instead of a fake global corporate government, have free nations that do work together, but it's all open and free, and then there's a competition of who's more open and free, and then there's a move towards alliances of good, not alliances of the fake war on terror, through stage terror.
[01:48:12.796 --> 01:48:15.317]  But I mean, we need to know our enemy.
[01:48:15.618 --> 01:48:19.420]  And my biggest message is for people to wake up to just how ruthless
[01:48:20.260 --> 01:48:23.803]  The controllers are, and I believe they are, psychopaths and sadists.
[01:48:24.063 --> 01:48:25.725]  They have sociopaths working for them.
[01:48:26.125 --> 01:48:30.729]  But I do believe, Lennon LaRoche, it's important to know that they're not going to give us quarter.
[01:48:30.929 --> 01:48:34.793]  That their endgame isn't just enslavement, it's death.
[01:48:36.074 --> 01:48:38.996]  Yeah, you look at the populations I do out there.
[01:48:39.917 --> 01:48:43.480]  The majority of the American population hates these people.
[01:48:44.221 --> 01:48:47.804]  And the problem is they don't have the degree of leadership.
[01:48:48.485 --> 01:48:50.526]  Which they would rely to have success.
[01:48:51.127 --> 01:48:52.408]  My job is to do that.
[01:48:53.468 --> 01:48:57.211]  I have very little except some of our circles and some friends.
[01:48:57.731 --> 01:48:59.252]  They're very little in the United States.
[01:48:59.272 --> 01:49:02.414]  It's really to beat mobilization to change this.
[01:49:03.155 --> 01:49:06.177]  But the American people hate what is being done to them.
[01:49:07.438 --> 01:49:08.899]  They're supposed to have the vote.
[01:49:09.619 --> 01:49:12.120]  They're supposed to exercise their right as citizens.
[01:49:12.700 --> 01:49:15.081]  They're supposed to think about how to protect themselves.
[01:49:15.601 --> 01:49:16.701]  But they've been demoralized.
[01:49:16.741 --> 01:49:18.742]  They don't think they can protect themselves anymore.
[01:49:19.142 --> 01:49:20.923]  We've got to get in there and slug.
[01:49:21.523 --> 01:49:26.265]  Because we've got to awaken the American people to their own... the courage which lies within them.
[01:49:26.385 --> 01:49:27.385]  So what do we do right now?
[01:49:27.465 --> 01:49:29.025]  Call into every talk radio show?
[01:49:29.085 --> 01:49:29.906]  Call Congress?
[01:49:30.546 --> 01:49:32.527]  And say this plan is going to wreck us?
[01:49:32.847 --> 01:49:34.147]  Reinstate Glass-Steagall?
[01:49:34.807 --> 01:49:35.768]  Arrest Ben Bernanke?
[01:49:36.801 --> 01:49:38.242]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:49:38.482 --> 01:49:45.605]  You've got to get, you've got to provide the American people with a sense there's a leadership out there which is not going to betray them.
[01:49:46.146 --> 01:49:51.528]  A leadership which is going to actually take the kinds of measures which will help us get out of this mess.
[01:49:52.789 --> 01:50:06.196]  We have to reestablish the confidence of the American people, not only in us as persons, but in the idea that we constitute an alternative leadership which is prepared to act in their defense.
[01:50:08.216 --> 01:50:14.781]  Without that message to our people now, who are suffering more and more, there is no hope for this nation.
[01:50:15.362 --> 01:50:16.663]  A nation must save itself.
[01:50:17.323 --> 01:50:20.426]  It must find a leadership which is willing to lead in saving itself.
[01:50:21.086 --> 01:50:22.187]  We have to love people.
[01:50:22.828 --> 01:50:23.949]  We have to love humanity.
[01:50:24.889 --> 01:50:31.495]  And it's out of that love for humanity that we're able to find the strength and the will to act to save humanity.
[01:50:33.777 --> 01:50:37.478]  All right, let's come back and take some phone calls for Len LaRouche.
[01:50:37.518 --> 01:50:39.979]  We appreciate joining us today.
[01:50:39.999 --> 01:50:43.320]  We'll also, on the other side, give you their websites.
[01:50:43.380 --> 01:50:47.941]  One of them is larouchepac.com, and he has several others.
[01:50:48.181 --> 01:50:52.182]  And of course, our websites are infowars.com and prisonplanet.tv.
[01:50:52.262 --> 01:50:59.964]  But this is a predatory economy meant to destroy civilization, and then the controllers sit in their armored high-tech redoubts.
[01:51:01.263 --> 01:51:02.904]  Take the first step in home security.
[01:51:03.084 --> 01:51:04.325]  Install the Door Sentinel.
[01:51:04.486 --> 01:51:07.808]  Standard locks, deadbolts, and security systems can't prevent forced entry.
[01:51:07.948 --> 01:51:12.272]  The Door Sentinel provides door kick-in protection and can be added to your existing security system.
[01:51:12.412 --> 01:51:15.935]  The Door Sentinel is easy to install and will turn your home into a fortress.
[01:51:16.095 --> 01:51:16.635]  Make the call.
[01:51:16.655 --> 01:51:16.715]  678-648-6757.
[01:51:16.895 --> 01:51:17.256]  That's 678-648-6757.
[01:51:17.296 --> 01:51:19.938]  Or visit them at S-E-N-T-I-N-E-L security group dot com.
[01:51:20.038 --> 01:51:21.639]  Sentinel security group dot com.
[01:51:30.566 --> 01:51:39.832]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:51:39.892 --> 01:51:40.633]  This capitalism?
[01:51:40.693 --> 01:51:46.837]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:51:46.977 --> 01:51:47.738]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:51:47.778 --> 01:51:50.880]  I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[01:51:50.920 --> 01:51:51.860]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[01:51:51.880 --> 01:51:52.921]  It's time to understand the system.
[01:51:52.941 --> 01:51:53.541]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:51:53.581 --> 01:51:53.862]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:52:00.786 --> 01:52:04.809]  You don't need me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis.
[01:52:05.229 --> 01:52:06.450]  Everyone can feel it.
[01:52:06.730 --> 01:52:15.176]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[01:52:15.637 --> 01:52:18.799]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising.
[01:52:19.059 --> 01:52:19.940]  But take heart.
[01:52:20.100 --> 01:52:23.622]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[01:52:23.902 --> 01:52:28.886]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war.
[01:52:29.286 --> 01:52:32.847]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[01:52:33.147 --> 01:52:34.588]  The globalists are scared.
[01:52:34.868 --> 01:52:35.868]  They've overreached.
[01:52:36.208 --> 01:52:39.329]  The future of the info war is in your hands.
[01:52:39.709 --> 01:52:41.730]  Join PrisonPlanet.tv.

[01:53:26.788 --> 01:53:27.228]  800-332-6784.
[01:53:30.229 --> 01:53:32.689]  Are you fed up with the Democrats and Republicans?
[01:53:33.029 --> 01:53:33.789]  Then listen up!
[01:53:34.030 --> 01:53:40.691]  Join American Third Position, a new political party formed to liberate the American people from the banksters who have overthrown the Republic.
[01:53:40.931 --> 01:53:45.972]  American Third Position advocates maximum liberty, limited government, and traditional morality.

[01:53:48.253 --> 01:53:51.916]  That's A, the number 3, P, dot M, E. It's time to take America back!
[01:54:08.717 --> 01:54:11.798]  Lennon LaRouche has agreed to stay with us about 15 minutes into the next hour.
[01:54:11.818 --> 01:54:21.241]  We're going to take some of your phone calls before he leaves us, get more into his ideas for solutions, and more on, if things aren't reversed, where this is going.
[01:54:21.261 --> 01:54:26.302]  Well, controlled crisis, and they'll use the breakdown of society as a way to take more and more of our liberties.
[01:54:26.362 --> 01:54:27.783]  I've watched the architecture
[01:54:29.258 --> 01:54:32.000]  A police state being built in earnest behind the scenes.
[01:54:32.020 --> 01:54:35.782]  Now it's being rolled out right as the collapse begins.
[01:54:36.242 --> 01:54:37.943]  This is absolutely incredible.
[01:54:38.684 --> 01:54:40.245]  And I do want to go to some of your phone calls.
[01:54:40.265 --> 01:54:41.286]  I know some were holding before.
[01:54:41.306 --> 01:54:44.127]  Lyndon LaRouche joined us, but he can speak on any of these topics.
[01:54:44.147 --> 01:54:46.369]  I mean, this all feeds together.
[01:54:47.129 --> 01:54:47.910]  There's some good news.
[01:54:47.930 --> 01:54:50.251]  I'll be covering it after Lyndon LaRouche leaves us.
[01:54:50.311 --> 01:54:51.252]  I mean, a big news blitz.
[01:54:51.292 --> 01:54:54.234]  German authorities reject useless radiation body scanners.
[01:54:55.230 --> 01:54:56.531]  I think what we've just addressed so far goes to
[01:55:18.237 --> 01:55:18.878]  We're good to go.
[01:55:37.438 --> 01:55:39.259]  Because mankind is creative.
[01:55:39.980 --> 01:55:43.602]  Contrary to the so-called second law of thermodynamics, which is a complete fraud.
[01:55:44.102 --> 01:55:45.043]  It always was a fraud.
[01:55:45.583 --> 01:55:50.927]  The nature of the solar system, including the galaxy, has always moved in a progressive way.
[01:55:50.967 --> 01:55:55.210]  That is, it's moved to a higher level of what we call energy flux density.
[01:55:55.550 --> 01:56:02.675]  The forms of life that have gone extinct, they were inferior in terms of these qualities to the species that succeeded them.
[01:56:03.365 --> 01:56:05.632]  Mankind is a latecomer.
[01:56:05.672 --> 01:56:07.839]  Just a few million years we've been on this planet.
[01:56:08.712 --> 01:56:10.533]  And we have transformed the planet.
[01:56:10.593 --> 01:56:14.395]  The planet today is dominated by mankind.
[01:56:14.815 --> 01:56:16.636]  There is not animal and mankind.
[01:56:16.656 --> 01:56:18.998]  There's not, you know, other things than mankind.
[01:56:19.278 --> 01:56:21.219]  Mankind is the center of this planet.
[01:56:21.399 --> 01:56:22.199]  It's our planet.
[01:56:22.800 --> 01:56:25.321]  It's our solar system, in fact, if we want to make it so.
[01:56:26.081 --> 01:56:28.443]  So, we have all these things, which are good things.
[01:56:29.043 --> 01:56:31.664]  The achievement of mankind, the idea that you make a discovery.
[01:56:32.185 --> 01:56:37.508]  You die after making the discovery, but people benefit from it after you're dead.
[01:56:38.789 --> 01:56:40.730]  You give to the species collective?
[01:56:42.031 --> 01:56:42.291]  No.
[01:56:44.353 --> 01:56:47.816]  I'm against collectivism under control thing.
[01:56:47.836 --> 01:56:56.363]  What I'm saying is, the progress, the ideas, the mathematics, the literature, the music, it builds and advances the species.
[01:56:56.643 --> 01:56:57.984]  That is true civilization.
[01:56:58.725 --> 01:56:59.145]  Exactly.
[01:56:59.546 --> 01:57:03.149]  The point is, every person was really decent.
[01:57:04.269 --> 01:57:07.152]  Always wanted their children to have a better life than they had.
[01:57:07.819 --> 01:57:12.680]  That was a characteristic of the American population, particularly of the immigrants and so forth, but also others.
[01:57:13.620 --> 01:57:18.641]  Our desire is that our lives will have meant something to those who come after us.
[01:57:19.402 --> 01:57:21.282]  That is the basis for human morality.
[01:57:21.782 --> 01:57:23.022]  It's a love of humanity.
[01:57:23.102 --> 01:57:24.062]  We are builders.
[01:57:24.963 --> 01:57:25.303]  That's right.
[01:57:26.263 --> 01:57:26.883]  Absolutely that.
[01:57:28.343 --> 01:57:35.545]  We love humanity because we think that our life has to mean something for the benefit of those generations to come later.
[01:57:36.201 --> 01:57:45.063]  That is the American idea, really, as opposed to what you get in Europe, a more oligarchical view of being tolerated by the ruling class or something.
[01:57:45.323 --> 01:58:02.747]  No, our struggle for freedom and our greatness lies in our special devotion in most parts of our life to the taking people into our country, giving them an opportunity for a better life than they had elsewhere, adopting them as our people, and taking pride even as we go to death.
[01:58:03.430 --> 01:58:07.959]  Pride in the fact that we're creating something better for our votes to come after us than we had.
[01:58:08.700 --> 01:58:12.548]  And our pride in a sense of justification that we are justified in living.
[01:58:13.405 --> 01:58:15.826]  We are something good in this system.
[01:58:15.987 --> 01:58:17.768]  And our contributions live on.
[01:58:18.228 --> 01:58:19.509]  It's not some arrogant thing.
[01:58:19.589 --> 01:58:21.110]  It's a love letter to the future.
[01:58:21.370 --> 01:58:26.353]  If I could meet my great-great-great-great-grandchildren that are unborn, I would love them as much as my children today.
[01:58:26.853 --> 01:58:29.835]  And that is my great instinct, my spirit, my drive.
[01:58:30.475 --> 01:58:31.396]  And that is humanity.
[01:58:31.436 --> 01:58:33.077]  And the globalists are the opposite of that.
[01:58:33.397 --> 01:58:36.579]  Back in 60 seconds, hour number three, with Lyndon LaRouche.
[01:58:36.839 --> 01:58:39.440]  Your phone calls and a huge news blitz straight ahead.
[01:58:42.372 --> 01:58:44.214]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:44.234 --> 01:58:48.017]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:55.097 --> 01:58:56.018]  Tyranny is here.
[01:58:56.359 --> 01:58:59.923]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:59:00.283 --> 01:59:02.546]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:59:02.686 --> 01:59:07.993]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:59:08.393 --> 01:59:14.641]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:59:15.041 --> 01:59:20.563]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:59:21.024 --> 01:59:24.705]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:59:25.205 --> 01:59:29.207]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:59:29.487 --> 01:59:35.009]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:59:35.429 --> 01:59:38.431]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:59:38.991 --> 01:59:40.411]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:59:40.972 --> 01:59:41.392]  It's here.

[02:00:12.031 --> 02:00:12.931]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.951 --> 02:00:17.252]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.772 --> 02:00:21.894]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.054 --> 02:00:26.895]  Lenin LaRouge is sharing his analysis.
[02:00:28.416 --> 02:00:40.625]  ...of what's happening geopolitically and with the so-called debt ceiling deal that the stock market got news that a deal had been made and went up and then as soon as they saw that it was all secretive and it started plunging.
[02:00:41.206 --> 02:00:45.529]  And the rating agencies that serve the big banks are saying, oh, you're still going to go bankrupt.
[02:00:45.849 --> 02:00:51.714]  So they're just positioning us and teaching us that it's all our fault right now, but that Lord Rothschild is going to save us.
[02:00:52.114 --> 02:00:55.616]  Danny in New York, you're on the air with Lyndon LaRouche for a question or comment.
[02:00:55.656 --> 02:00:55.997]  Go ahead.
[02:00:57.304 --> 02:00:58.445]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[02:00:58.625 --> 02:00:58.845]  Good.
[02:00:59.205 --> 02:01:02.667]  I'm also actually the guy that did the Hal Sparks interview that you played last week.
[02:01:02.807 --> 02:01:04.368]  I want to thank you for everything you do.
[02:01:04.568 --> 02:01:06.309]  Mr. LaRouche, great breakdown.
[02:01:06.329 --> 02:01:12.772]  I went to, I organized actually, a protest at the Fed on Friday during a Treasury meeting with the bankers.
[02:01:13.412 --> 02:01:18.114]  And these guys are just so prideful and obnoxious.
[02:01:18.575 --> 02:01:19.835]  The mainstream media was there.
[02:01:20.155 --> 02:01:22.637]  All of them refused to report that the Fed is a private bank.
[02:01:23.938 --> 02:01:25.019]  But things have changed.
[02:01:25.339 --> 02:01:31.827]  Ten years ago when fed heads went to Congress, everyone bowed and actually tremulated in their voice when they talked to them.
[02:01:32.107 --> 02:01:33.909]  Now they're screamed at and shouted at.
[02:01:34.309 --> 02:01:35.391]  The worm is turning.
[02:01:35.431 --> 02:01:39.876]  We are identifying the progenitors of our pain.
[02:01:41.192 --> 02:01:51.219]  Yeah, absolutely, and we're educating people in the area, and there's a lot more people willing to stop and talk to us and just hear about how the Fed is private.
[02:01:51.559 --> 02:01:58.224]  Bloomberg reported that the Fed Board of Governors is a government agency, but that the New York Fed and other banks are owned by their shareholders.
[02:01:58.284 --> 02:02:02.126]  I mean, I think the bankers are really exposed right now, and this is the time we have to strike.
[02:02:02.547 --> 02:02:06.009]  If you want to see that article, you can Google the Federal Reserve admits it's 12 banks are
[02:02:06.229 --> 02:02:07.590]  No, I saw that last Thursday.
[02:02:07.731 --> 02:02:10.653]  Great job, Danny, and great job with the work you're doing.
[02:02:10.734 --> 02:02:12.215]  Do you have any questions for Lyndon LaRouche?
[02:02:13.036 --> 02:02:13.396]  I do.
[02:02:13.476 --> 02:02:17.620]  Before I get to that, I just want to mention that somebody had mentioned last week about 9-11 events.
[02:02:17.940 --> 02:02:26.729]  We are having Liberty Fest, which with Richard being here... Listen, I will plug that stuff, and I'm planning to get Luke on or send me an email, but we've got limited time with Lyndon.
[02:02:26.769 --> 02:02:29.772]  If you've got a question, you know, that's why he's here.
[02:02:29.792 --> 02:02:30.613]  Do you have anything for him?
[02:02:31.496 --> 02:02:32.156]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:02:32.256 --> 02:02:37.198]  I just wanted to, you were saying, you know, we need a new set of leaders who care about humanity, and I 100% with you.
[02:02:37.218 --> 02:02:39.839]  I mean, I think this has been a great interview that I'm going to spread around.
[02:02:40.799 --> 02:02:46.681]  Are you talking about a system of Republican democracy and a free market, or what exactly is the solution?
[02:02:46.701 --> 02:02:47.501]  Okay, thank you, Danny.
[02:02:47.561 --> 02:02:48.482]  Lyndon, go ahead.
[02:02:49.242 --> 02:02:52.563]  I would say, to say Republican democracy, that's fine.
[02:02:53.963 --> 02:02:54.444]  It's fine.
[02:02:54.564 --> 02:02:58.645]  We're a republic of accountability for the end result of what we vote for.
[02:03:01.714 --> 02:03:07.826]  Because a pure democracy, the oligarchs can finance brainwashing and get 51% to vote their rights away.
[02:03:08.126 --> 02:03:10.510]  In a republic they're set in stone, they can't be removed.
[02:03:11.983 --> 02:03:20.309]  It is solidarity among the citizens to a common purpose, and they each try to fit their own ends with a common purpose.
[02:03:20.709 --> 02:03:28.575]  They come to an agreement in compromises, which are legitimate compromises, in order to achieve a common interest, a common purpose.
[02:03:28.856 --> 02:03:31.257]  Neil in Arizona, go ahead, question or comment?
[02:03:32.118 --> 02:03:33.679]  I have a question for Mr. LaRouche.
[02:03:34.320 --> 02:03:34.580]  Go ahead.
[02:03:35.567 --> 02:03:56.422]  Okay, I wanted to start out by saying the debt to GDP is currently 95%, which is the highest since World War II era, but currently we're not at war with the Nazis, and we have to continually raise the debt ceiling by $1 trillion every year to keep up with that, or the U.S.
[02:03:56.462 --> 02:03:58.403]  will default, the currency will default.
[02:03:59.366 --> 02:04:07.937]  And I just wondered what Mr. LaRouche thought about their solution to just injecting more money into the economy.
[02:04:08.738 --> 02:04:11.822]  Hopefully I didn't crash the show, but I think we're talking along those lines.
[02:04:11.842 --> 02:04:12.823]  No, no, it's a good question.
[02:04:12.843 --> 02:04:13.985]  We're going to break in 45 seconds.
[02:04:14.305 --> 02:04:15.587]  Len LaRouche, take that question.
[02:04:16.638 --> 02:04:19.981]  Okay, the point is, progress is not a disaster.
[02:04:20.521 --> 02:04:22.323]  It's the lack of progress that's a disaster.
[02:04:22.543 --> 02:04:27.147]  Scientific progress is essential to the continued existence of the human species.
[02:04:27.548 --> 02:04:31.371]  Cutting back on scientific progress would mean the earlier death of the human species.
[02:04:33.493 --> 02:04:37.897]  But, I mean, his question was this debt to GDP ratio.
[02:04:39.225 --> 02:04:39.605]  Forget it.
[02:04:40.086 --> 02:04:47.910]  The Glass-Steagall Act, done now, in the United States, would eliminate all these problems.
[02:04:48.970 --> 02:04:49.690]  Alright, stay there.
[02:04:49.710 --> 02:04:53.672]  We're going to come back and go to Robert, David, Randy, and others, 800-259-9231.
[02:04:54.453 --> 02:05:00.076]  I'm Alex Jones with the GCN Radio Network, GCNlive.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.

[02:06:00.710 --> 02:06:01.870]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:06:01.890 --> 02:06:08.015]  citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:06:08.815 --> 02:06:11.096]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:06:11.356 --> 02:06:16.537]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:06:16.737 --> 02:06:19.517]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:06:19.777 --> 02:06:21.898]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:06:22.098 --> 02:06:28.019]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:06:28.339 --> 02:06:31.540]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:06:31.720 --> 02:06:33.100]  Recently, he created a video
[02:06:33.260 --> 02:06:33.480]  We're good.
[02:06:56.917 --> 02:06:58.238]  EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:06:58.398 --> 02:07:00.118]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:07:00.338 --> 02:07:04.560]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[02:07:04.880 --> 02:07:08.942]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:07:09.222 --> 02:07:14.604]  Number two, our new Energy Czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:07:14.964 --> 02:07:15.404]  It's true.
[02:07:15.705 --> 02:07:21.129]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:07:21.409 --> 02:07:24.691]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:07:24.991 --> 02:07:28.714]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:07:29.695 --> 02:07:32.077]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:07:32.457 --> 02:07:35.799]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:07:36.920 --> 02:07:40.842]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:07:41.062 --> 02:07:45.844]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:07:46.124 --> 02:07:50.145]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:50.285 --> 02:07:51.846]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:52.086 --> 02:07:56.688]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:08:01.383 --> 02:08:03.566]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:04.126 --> 02:08:07.009]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:16.780 --> 02:08:19.343]  Alright, Len LaRouche is our guest for the rest of this segment.
[02:08:19.363 --> 02:08:22.387]  We're going to go to George, Bob, Robert, David, and Randy.
[02:08:23.874 --> 02:08:33.358]  In the minutes we have left, I'm going to give you a big news blitz of important information we haven't gotten to today that's very important, and then continue with your phone calls.
[02:08:34.419 --> 02:08:49.286]  We also have a report here that was just sent out minutes ago by our guest organization, larouchepub.com, and the headline is, a vote for debt deal is a vote for treason,
[02:08:50.570 --> 02:09:05.120]  And it breaks down the fact that Obama has named a super Congress, which even the Associated Press admits is not in the Constitution, a 12-person body composed of six Democrats and six Republicans.
[02:09:05.620 --> 02:09:08.542]  So they're agreeing on legislation to sign power away.
[02:09:09.142 --> 02:09:12.385]  And we've now learned that what they proposed two weeks ago is in the legislation.
[02:09:14.166 --> 02:09:16.887]  Continuing here with this information,
[02:09:20.962 --> 02:09:30.467]  It goes on, the recommendations made by the Super Congress for the additional 1.5 trillion in cuts will be sent to both houses of Congress to receive only an up or down vote.
[02:09:30.947 --> 02:09:44.335]  The House and Senate cannot amend or filibuster the recommendations of the Super Congress, which again suspends House rules, because you've got to have larger majorities in these spending bills.
[02:09:44.815 --> 02:09:48.017]  So this is basically changing the rules of the Congress.
[02:09:48.517 --> 02:09:49.558]  Wow, this really is
[02:09:50.458 --> 02:09:56.460]  I remember a few weeks ago seeing Republicans and Democrats recommend this and thinking there's no way they'll actually do it.
[02:09:57.580 --> 02:10:04.362]  But reportedly that is in the agreement and I've got the Associated Press and others here saying that yes, there will be this committee.
[02:10:04.662 --> 02:10:05.542]  But it's not a committee.
[02:10:06.543 --> 02:10:12.825]  It's the leaders of the House and Senate saying now the rest of the House and the Senate aren't involved.
[02:10:13.185 --> 02:10:16.746]  Oh, we've got groups here that aren't going along with this from the Tea Party or from the Liberals.
[02:10:17.606 --> 02:10:18.566]  Both groups don't like it.
[02:10:19.046 --> 02:10:19.926]  We'll just ignore you.
[02:10:19.966 --> 02:10:24.627]  What is Obama saying he'll do with the new 10-member Governor's Council?
[02:10:24.727 --> 02:10:25.648]  Ignore the other states.
[02:10:25.788 --> 02:10:26.648]  The Rural Council.
[02:10:27.228 --> 02:10:29.568]  They really are setting up a dictatorial system.
[02:10:31.629 --> 02:10:34.669]  Lenin LaRouche, it is amazing to see this actually happening.
[02:10:36.089 --> 02:10:36.309]  Yes.
[02:10:37.810 --> 02:10:39.370]  It's not surprising to me.
[02:10:40.110 --> 02:10:44.411]  But it's amazing, I think, for most of the people of the United States to see that their own government
[02:10:45.265 --> 02:10:53.190]  Under a foreign, actually a foreign controlled president, he's actually out to destroy the United States and to destroy the people in it.
[02:10:54.130 --> 02:10:58.313]  It's amazing to see such a crime allowed to happen.
[02:10:59.685 --> 02:11:03.387]  By the permission of some people who are highly placed in politics.
[02:11:03.407 --> 02:11:15.193]  Well, they're preparing the public for the admission that we're completely bankrupt and going into receivership and saying a super congress will decide and the states won't decide, no one will decide but a few hand-picked globalists.
[02:11:15.253 --> 02:11:15.673]  Incredible.
[02:11:15.933 --> 02:11:18.654]  Bob in California, you're on the air with our guest, Lennon LaRouche.
[02:11:19.675 --> 02:11:25.057]  Yes, Lennon, thanks for all you've done for this country or tried to do for this country over the last 50 years.
[02:11:27.139 --> 02:11:28.439]  Nice to have people out there like you.
[02:11:28.779 --> 02:11:33.020]  My comment is, I was in the manufacturing business for about 30 years.
[02:11:33.780 --> 02:11:44.142]  Around 1995, I was getting phone calls two or three, four times a week from different agencies, trying to say that I could be paid money to move my business to China.
[02:11:44.742 --> 02:11:45.923]  I don't know what that was all about.
[02:11:45.943 --> 02:11:47.383]  I didn't want to go to China.
[02:11:47.843 --> 02:11:50.604]  I eventually went down with a sinking ship.
[02:11:50.664 --> 02:11:52.744]  I could not compete against the Chinese thing.
[02:11:53.154 --> 02:11:56.979]  But if we don't bring the manufacturing back to this country in some form...
[02:11:58.545 --> 02:12:00.246]  I don't think we can ever recover.
[02:12:00.366 --> 02:12:03.208]  We cannot do it on a service-based economy alone.
[02:12:03.608 --> 02:12:16.555]  It is naked tyranny and corruption and treason to, for 15, 16 years, have the open policy to pay to move ULA and to pay to move our factories.
[02:12:16.575 --> 02:12:22.377]  I mean, our tax money paid to move General Motors plants to Eastern Europe, China, and Brazil.
[02:12:22.938 --> 02:12:24.699]  Why are they doing this, Lyn and LaRouche?
[02:12:25.919 --> 02:12:27.120]  They want to destroy us.
[02:12:28.118 --> 02:12:32.759]  And many people inside the United States of great influence are completely, wittingly complicit with that.
[02:12:32.979 --> 02:12:33.520]  It is incredible.
[02:12:33.540 --> 02:12:34.920]  They want to destroy us.
[02:12:35.240 --> 02:12:37.621]  Look, they killed Kennedy to get us into a war.
[02:12:38.301 --> 02:12:39.361]  Which Kennedy opposed.
[02:12:39.881 --> 02:12:41.322]  And Douglas MacArthur opposed.
[02:12:42.062 --> 02:12:44.523]  So they solved the problem by killing Kennedy.
[02:12:45.663 --> 02:12:46.643]  Then they killed his brother.
[02:12:49.308 --> 02:12:50.589]  A whole series of things.
[02:12:50.629 --> 02:12:53.730]  We had some presidents who were not so bad and some who were really terrible.
[02:12:54.250 --> 02:12:55.851]  But this is the point.
[02:12:57.031 --> 02:12:59.572]  The American people have lost control of their own government.
[02:13:01.553 --> 02:13:05.734]  Partly by corruption, partly by wear and tear and so forth.
[02:13:05.754 --> 02:13:12.877]  There's been a shortage of capable leaders of the United States who are in the real tradition of the United States.
[02:13:13.818 --> 02:13:14.678]  That's the problem.
[02:13:15.858 --> 02:13:17.199]  All we can do, as I can do,
[02:13:18.024 --> 02:13:25.211]  Is do the best we can in order to provide people that kind of leadership available to them, which will solve these problems.
[02:13:26.011 --> 02:13:28.313]  And people have thought, well, maybe that won't work.
[02:13:28.393 --> 02:13:32.157]  Maybe we've got to go with these guys who are running the show and hopefully they'll give us a better deal.
[02:13:32.876 --> 02:13:33.897]  And now we see what they've got.
[02:13:33.957 --> 02:13:34.698]  They went too far.
[02:13:35.459 --> 02:13:37.801]  They gave the better deal to too many other people.
[02:13:37.921 --> 02:13:49.372]  Well, you're saying there's 24 hours, and I appreciate your call, Bob, to reverse this, but this just keeps us on the same slow slide and, you know, creates this commission that will then decide to get us in deeper and deeper debt.
[02:13:49.432 --> 02:13:55.338]  But, I mean, we are in a depression and it's worsening, but how will this start triggering things immediately?
[02:13:55.979 --> 02:13:57.220]  I think it's triggering it right now.
[02:13:59.033 --> 02:14:03.015]  What you have, you have a confusion among the majority of the American people.
[02:14:03.035 --> 02:14:05.216]  The majority of the American people hate this.
[02:14:05.937 --> 02:14:06.437]  They hate it.
[02:14:07.638 --> 02:14:09.739]  They are despairing, however, at the same time.
[02:14:10.799 --> 02:14:14.581]  They don't believe that there are any institutions which will help them achieve their aims.
[02:14:15.582 --> 02:14:22.585]  All I can do, as you are doing, and others are doing, all we can do is give a message and hope that we get in enough, not merely
[02:14:26.551 --> 02:14:30.553]  But also inspire some of our fellow citizens who hate this too.
[02:14:31.113 --> 02:14:40.716]  Instead of doing just hate, hating the system, what they should do is join and form mass leadership, which stops this thing right now.
[02:14:41.216 --> 02:14:42.977]  And we need it within 24 hours.
[02:14:43.677 --> 02:14:44.758]  Get the fiscal for 24 hours.
[02:14:46.380 --> 02:14:52.205]  Well, it's not a done deal yet, so we need to pressure folks that, because they get us all obsessed over the deal, the deal, let's get a deal.
[02:14:52.605 --> 02:14:53.926]  Well, not if it's a bad deal.
[02:14:54.307 --> 02:14:55.768]  And the stock market doesn't like it.
[02:14:55.888 --> 02:14:57.229]  It has plunged.
[02:14:58.070 --> 02:15:01.593]  It has plunged, what, 300 points today.
[02:15:02.113 --> 02:15:03.755]  It's still continuing to drop.
[02:15:04.075 --> 02:15:06.958]  Why is the stock market not liking this news?
[02:15:08.717 --> 02:15:10.977]  What they're doing is, you think of the squeeze of this thing.
[02:15:11.277 --> 02:15:12.698]  The stock market is a fake.
[02:15:13.118 --> 02:15:14.898]  There's no truth to the stock market.
[02:15:15.338 --> 02:15:18.339]  There are no natural determining values in the stock market.
[02:15:18.499 --> 02:15:19.339]  It's complete fraud.
[02:15:20.239 --> 02:15:26.160]  But, what happens is, you have a certain section of the population out there which thinks it has money.
[02:15:26.880 --> 02:15:29.841]  It's invested in things that are worthless, but they think they are assets.
[02:15:30.441 --> 02:15:33.381]  And they look at the accounting sheet and say, ah, I got assets.
[02:15:34.021 --> 02:15:35.482]  Well, that could be wiped out overnight.
[02:15:36.662 --> 02:15:37.942]  Because there's no value out there.
[02:15:38.743 --> 02:15:40.545]  We have to start creating value again.
[02:15:41.346 --> 02:15:42.707]  And so they believe it.
[02:15:44.069 --> 02:15:45.130]  Other people are intimidated.
[02:15:45.971 --> 02:15:46.531]  And they do it.
[02:15:47.513 --> 02:15:58.164]  And because we are not united against them with their crazy policies, we don't force our people who are elected to begin to represent the people.
[02:15:59.505 --> 02:16:00.406]  We can go to hell.
[02:16:01.448 --> 02:16:04.009]  Well, that's what happens with tyranny, is that they never stop.
[02:16:04.230 --> 02:16:07.471]  You've got to stop them somewhere, because they always want more, more, more.
[02:16:07.732 --> 02:16:08.772]  Things don't just stay the same.
[02:16:08.792 --> 02:16:09.873]  They get better, they get worse.
[02:16:10.193 --> 02:16:14.115]  They don't just sit in one spot, and there's definite motion here towards the bad.
[02:16:14.796 --> 02:16:15.936]  Robert in Pennsylvania.
[02:16:15.976 --> 02:16:17.097]  You're on the air with Lyndon LaRouche.
[02:16:17.117 --> 02:16:17.477]  Go ahead.
[02:16:17.497 --> 02:16:19.598]  Hi, Mr. LaRouche.
[02:16:20.059 --> 02:16:22.700]  Thank you for what you're trying to do, and thank you, Alex.
[02:16:22.860 --> 02:16:24.421]  I've been listening for six years now.
[02:16:24.441 --> 02:16:25.282]  You've changed my life.
[02:16:26.337 --> 02:16:44.919]  Anyway, one thought that I've had over the years listening to you, Alex, and just listening to you, Mr. LaRouche, is that in studying human nature, I came across a concept called social dominance orientation, which is basically a body of knowledge that says that humans organize into stratum, or castes,
[02:16:45.419 --> 02:16:46.960]  That's right, it's divide and conquer!
[02:17:14.031 --> 02:17:14.351]  I'm sorry?
[02:17:14.691 --> 02:17:15.552]  Divide and conquer.
[02:17:16.312 --> 02:17:16.692]  Exactly.
[02:17:16.712 --> 02:17:19.233]  And who is that 5% who represent the maverick?
[02:17:19.273 --> 02:17:20.554]  And God bless you, Alex.
[02:17:21.074 --> 02:17:26.197]  I think the future will judge you as significant to the survival of humanity.
[02:17:26.217 --> 02:17:27.517]  And I mean that.
[02:17:27.537 --> 02:17:35.401]  I think that you are doing what's necessary to wake people up and break them from that bind of Howard Wired.
[02:17:36.261 --> 02:17:37.142]  Let's be clear, though.
[02:17:38.082 --> 02:17:38.702]  Let's be clear.
[02:17:38.822 --> 02:17:40.043]  We're all doing this.
[02:17:40.083 --> 02:17:42.743]  We're all mavericks that care, that are involved.
[02:17:43.063 --> 02:17:49.465]  Just seeking after knowledge is the beginning of true victory in civilization, and I appreciate your call, Robert.
[02:17:49.485 --> 02:17:51.885]  Len LaRouche, comments on what Robert was just saying?
[02:17:54.046 --> 02:17:56.347]  I've just... I've said what I've already said.
[02:17:57.247 --> 02:17:59.987]  We have the chance now, within a short time.
[02:18:01.168 --> 02:18:02.268]  I know we have the chance.
[02:18:03.109 --> 02:18:04.370]  Because the people out there want it.
[02:18:04.931 --> 02:18:14.141]  We have to mobilize the people out there to unite in their own interests and force their representatives in the legislatures and elsewhere to act for us.
[02:18:15.282 --> 02:18:16.403]  And I do what I can.
[02:18:16.623 --> 02:18:17.604]  Do you agree?
[02:18:17.724 --> 02:18:19.867]  Because that's what I saw a few weeks ago but I wasn't sure.
[02:18:20.367 --> 02:18:22.388]  Now we are sure, because what you're saying is confirmed.
[02:18:22.408 --> 02:18:24.410]  They're saying, well, they've kind of kicked the can.
[02:18:24.430 --> 02:18:32.035]  They've agreed to raise it, but now a new commission will change the voting rules in the Congress, and the rest of Congress doesn't matter.
[02:18:32.535 --> 02:18:34.396]  Only these 12 people and the President do.
[02:18:35.357 --> 02:18:37.158]  The debt ceiling was all a distraction.
[02:18:37.859 --> 02:18:45.144]  This was all about creating a new super Congress that I warned about in a few videos last week, and now they've really done it.
[02:18:45.204 --> 02:18:46.184]  I mean, this is incredible.
[02:18:48.346 --> 02:18:49.927]  Well, this is what they did.
[02:18:51.121 --> 02:18:52.262]  We have been betrayed.
[02:18:52.542 --> 02:18:54.664]  We've been betrayed by our own delusions.
[02:18:55.144 --> 02:18:56.205]  We can trust these people.
[02:18:57.666 --> 02:18:58.727]  The evidence was all there.
[02:18:58.767 --> 02:19:02.829]  The disaster, the collapse of Detroit, for example, was a part of this thing.
[02:19:03.270 --> 02:19:07.953]  All of the things that happened were things that were done to us, inch by inch and step by step.
[02:19:08.273 --> 02:19:14.718]  We have allowed ourselves to be destroyed by a small oligarchy, which is an international oligarchy.
[02:19:15.532 --> 02:19:16.394]  And that's our problem.
[02:19:16.854 --> 02:19:27.192]  Maybe at this point, the things are serious enough that the American people will stand up, not whimpering about what they're suffering, but angrily, but firmly, saying no.
[02:19:29.562 --> 02:19:30.763]  Obama, go.
[02:19:31.283 --> 02:19:32.544]  You're a fascist swine.
[02:19:32.724 --> 02:19:33.004]  Go.
[02:19:33.545 --> 02:19:34.105]  Get out of here.
[02:19:34.645 --> 02:19:39.448]  I agree with you that we must identify what they're doing, that it's by design and say no.
[02:19:39.829 --> 02:19:43.351]  Len LaRouche, thank you so much for spending time with us today.
[02:19:43.691 --> 02:19:44.772]  LaRouchePub.com.
[02:19:45.052 --> 02:19:47.173]  Look forward to talking to you as this unfolds.
[02:19:47.714 --> 02:19:48.594]  Continue your research.
[02:19:48.814 --> 02:19:49.515]  We'll talk to you soon.
[02:19:50.439 --> 02:19:50.799]  Okay, fine.
[02:19:51.559 --> 02:19:52.340]  Alright, there they go.
[02:19:52.380 --> 02:19:54.541]  We're gonna come back with your phone calls, then a bunch of news.
[02:19:54.561 --> 02:19:58.262]  But I'm gonna get to Dave, Nick, Randy, Karen, and others, then I'm getting into all the news.
[02:19:58.722 --> 02:20:00.983]  But this is a giant dictatorial power grab.
[02:20:01.063 --> 02:20:04.324]  Are you tired of spending money for metal canning lids year after year?
[02:20:04.364 --> 02:20:04.705]  Then stop!
[02:20:06.065 --> 02:20:09.087]  Stop buying metal lids and get Tattler reusable canning lids.
[02:20:09.507 --> 02:20:16.650]  Made of USDA and FDA approved food grade plastic, Tattler canning lids let you safely store emergency preparedness foods for years.
[02:20:16.990 --> 02:20:29.216]  Traditional metal lids are single-use throwaways that contain BPA, but Tattler canning lids are indefinitely reusable and guaranteed to last a lifetime when used as design for home canning and contain no BPA.
[02:20:29.496 --> 02:20:31.117]  Tattler lids are dishwasher safe,
[02:20:31.257 --> 02:20:39.618]  Perfect for standard pressure or water bath canning, eliminate food spoilage from acid corrosion, fit standard mason jars, and are proudly made in the USA.

[02:20:46.560 --> 02:20:47.140]  The original since 1976.
[02:21:01.817 --> 02:21:04.979]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.
[02:21:05.179 --> 02:21:13.203]  I designed our top-selling holster, the SuperTuck Deluxe, to solve the problems of being poked, pinched, and gouged while carrying concealed.

[02:21:30.171 --> 02:21:31.252]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:21:31.412 --> 02:21:35.795]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:21:35.975 --> 02:21:41.699]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:21:41.779 --> 02:21:45.201]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:21:45.421 --> 02:21:48.043]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:48.143 --> 02:21:53.066]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:21:53.206 --> 02:21:53.487]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:53.507 --> 02:21:54.848]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:00.211 --> 02:22:04.435]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:22:04.755 --> 02:22:05.035]  Number 1.
[02:22:05.676 --> 02:22:08.818]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:22:09.099 --> 02:22:09.659]  Number 2.
[02:22:09.959 --> 02:22:14.503]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:22:14.843 --> 02:22:15.304]  It's true.
[02:22:15.584 --> 02:22:20.148]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:22:20.468 --> 02:22:21.009]  Number 3.
[02:22:21.289 --> 02:22:24.572]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:22:24.872 --> 02:22:28.575]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:22:28.775 --> 02:22:29.336]  Number 4.
[02:22:29.576 --> 02:22:31.938]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:22:32.338 --> 02:22:35.721]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:22:36.021 --> 02:22:36.222]  Number 5.
[02:22:36.802 --> 02:22:40.725]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:22:40.946 --> 02:22:45.710]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:22:45.990 --> 02:22:50.035]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:22:50.175 --> 02:22:51.737]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:22:51.957 --> 02:22:54.040]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:22:54.200 --> 02:22:56.543]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:23:01.232 --> 02:23:05.517]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[02:23:05.917 --> 02:23:11.784]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[02:23:12.364 --> 02:23:14.106]  Number one, study the past.
[02:23:14.627 --> 02:23:16.389]  History really does repeat itself.
[02:23:17.029 --> 02:23:20.753]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[02:23:21.860 --> 02:23:24.143]  Number three, take decisive action.
[02:23:24.943 --> 02:23:28.227]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[02:23:28.808 --> 02:23:33.533]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[02:23:33.853 --> 02:23:37.277]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[02:23:37.837 --> 02:23:40.699]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[02:23:41.239 --> 02:23:45.222]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:23:45.742 --> 02:23:49.985]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[02:23:50.665 --> 02:23:54.788]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:23:55.308 --> 02:23:57.469]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:24:09.341 --> 02:24:14.923]  Okay, I've had time now since this morning to go over the agreement.
[02:24:16.683 --> 02:24:27.627]  And it's an agreement to have the Congress vote in the House and Senate to sign their authority over to 12-person super-Congress, and they're calling it a blue-ribbon committee to confuse people.
[02:24:29.332 --> 02:24:34.779]  The creation of what Obama has named a Super Congress, a 12-person body composed of six Democrats, six Republicans.
[02:24:35.560 --> 02:24:44.071]  See, not your elected representatives then voting individually, but no, we pick six from each party, from the leadership, and then they decide.
[02:24:45.418 --> 02:24:51.682]  Who were tasked to come up with the additional $1.5 trillion in cuts by November 23rd of this year.
[02:24:52.283 --> 02:25:00.028]  Third, the recommendations made by the Super Congress for its additional $1.5 trillion in cuts will be sent to both houses of Congress to receive only an up or down vote.
[02:25:01.449 --> 02:25:03.230]  So again, they're changing the House rules.
[02:25:04.071 --> 02:25:07.773]  The House and Senate cannot amend or filibuster the recommendations of the Super Congress.
[02:25:07.793 --> 02:25:10.235]  So, that's getting rid of the filibuster power.
[02:25:10.275 --> 02:25:11.296]  This is unbelievable.
[02:25:12.619 --> 02:25:15.341]  It's like Obama launched a war in Libya and said, I don't need Congress.
[02:25:15.781 --> 02:25:18.924]  It's like they're trying to push through their cybersecurity takeover, but going ahead and doing it.
[02:25:19.244 --> 02:25:20.245]  And the carbon taxes.
[02:25:21.386 --> 02:25:24.608]  Everything is about a power grab, setting up a 10-member governor board.
[02:25:25.669 --> 02:25:26.850]  Forget the other 40 states.
[02:25:28.800 --> 02:25:32.902]  The House and Senate cannot amend or filibuster the recommendations of the Super Congress.
[02:25:33.582 --> 02:25:42.286]  If the Congress votes no on the recommendations, the $1.5 trillion in cuts will be eventually distributed between the defense, budget, and domestic entitlement programs.
[02:25:43.627 --> 02:25:47.608]  So, that's Congress voting ahead of time to give up their power later.
[02:25:49.049 --> 02:25:53.731]  If the Congress does not go along with the proposed cuts to the Super Congress, the cuts go through anyway.
[02:25:54.411 --> 02:25:55.272]  This is incredible.
[02:25:56.806 --> 02:25:58.691]  This is what Congress is voting on today.
[02:25:58.911 --> 02:26:02.680]  As of this morning, there is opposition from the Progressive Caucus and the Black Caucus.
[02:26:02.701 --> 02:26:05.708]  However, many other members of Congress are ready to vote for treason.
[02:26:06.533 --> 02:26:14.478]  They're capitulating to the terror campaign run by the White House, Wall Street and the City of London that has said that if the debt ceiling is not raised it will cause the government shutdown.
[02:26:15.158 --> 02:26:15.538]  The U.S.
[02:26:15.598 --> 02:26:20.781]  credit rating and credit rating of cities and states will be downgraded and the markets will crash.
[02:26:21.062 --> 02:26:25.824]  But they're saying even if it does pass, Moody's and S&P are out today saying we're still going to lose it anyway.
[02:26:26.105 --> 02:26:28.526]  We're just being squeezed a little more before they do it.
[02:26:29.026 --> 02:26:31.548]  Instead of just saying no to the derivatives and all this could end.
[02:26:32.752 --> 02:26:33.233]  Incredible.
[02:26:33.893 --> 02:26:35.074]  And then we've got the article here.
[02:26:35.094 --> 02:26:37.576]  I'm going to send all this to Watson and get a new article out on it.
[02:26:37.896 --> 02:26:38.837]  Kurt Nemos, welcome.
[02:26:38.977 --> 02:26:40.078]  I know Aaron Dykes is listening.
[02:26:40.518 --> 02:26:41.979]  Steve Watson, our great researchers.
[02:26:42.019 --> 02:26:45.662]  But this is what I called in the last two weeks in the video reports we put out.
[02:26:46.242 --> 02:26:49.284]  Obama's final loophole, the catastrophic emergency clause.
[02:26:50.085 --> 02:26:52.607]  Homeland Security Presidential Directive H.S.P.D.
[02:26:52.627 --> 02:26:56.069]  20 and National Security Presidential Directive N.S.P.D. 51.
[02:26:58.075 --> 02:27:00.118]  Set up by Bush, now carried out by Obama.
[02:27:00.859 --> 02:27:07.207]  Because if Congress doesn't go along with this at least smokescreen fake Congress, super Congress, they'll just pull the trigger and he'll do it.
[02:27:08.749 --> 02:27:10.732]  But it's good to make a tyrant act like a tyrant.
[02:27:12.615 --> 02:27:14.297]  Let's go ahead and talk to David in Maine.
[02:27:14.337 --> 02:27:15.218]  David, thanks for holding.
[02:27:15.258 --> 02:27:15.559]  Go ahead.
[02:27:16.246 --> 02:27:17.326]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:27:17.786 --> 02:27:28.090]  I'm a first-time caller from the Grand State of Maine, and I have a question for you and Mr. LaRouche, but if Mr. LaRouche isn't available, I'll address it to you.
[02:27:28.110 --> 02:27:31.171]  Yeah, I'm sorry, he's gone now, but I can try to answer your question.
[02:27:32.351 --> 02:27:37.232]  I was wondering if you were aware that an historic event is occurring.
[02:27:38.313 --> 02:27:40.413]  The Joe government is being restored.
[02:27:40.433 --> 02:27:45.755]  The Republic for the United States is being restored per constitutional law.
[02:27:46.827 --> 02:27:50.168]  Uh, it is the restoration of what was abandoned in 1860.
[02:27:50.248 --> 02:27:55.288]  And... Sir, were you sent a, what, a Nassara email?
[02:27:56.469 --> 02:27:56.689]  No.
[02:27:58.129 --> 02:28:09.391]  No, this is about the Republic for the United States of America that is being reseated as of 2010, uh, about March 30th, I guess it is.
[02:28:09.871 --> 02:28:15.852]  It's reseating the Republic that was abandoned just prior to the Civil War.
[02:28:17.592 --> 02:28:23.595]  I mean, there's a lot of groups that meet and stuff and have new continental congresses and things, but what specifically are you talking about?
[02:28:24.476 --> 02:28:41.345]  Well, jury assemblies are being made up of groups of we the people who have chosen to be active participants in the de jure, that means lawful, grand juries now being formed all across the land in each of the 53 states in America.
[02:28:41.425 --> 02:28:45.646]  Well, look, I'm not saying that it isn't good to have these types of talks and things.
[02:28:46.066 --> 02:28:48.647]  Are you talking about the stuff that Kennedy guy put out last year?
[02:28:48.667 --> 02:28:53.708]  He was one of the originals.
[02:28:54.568 --> 02:28:56.468]  Listen, David, I appreciate your call.
[02:28:56.829 --> 02:28:57.209]  You know what?
[02:28:57.769 --> 02:28:59.549]  The globalists are completely lawless.
[02:28:59.589 --> 02:29:03.290]  They've set up Homeland Security to physically try to suppress us.
[02:29:04.210 --> 02:29:07.131]  We need to be calling them out as illegitimate hijackers.
[02:29:08.743 --> 02:29:13.069]  Not forming a committee in the back of the plane to say we're running a government in the back of the plane.
[02:29:13.470 --> 02:29:17.476]  We're going to have to call the hijacker out to the other dumb flyers who don't know it's a hijacker.
[02:29:17.876 --> 02:29:18.777]  That's the first goal.
[02:29:19.904 --> 02:29:23.926]  And if you can get state grand juries and grand juries to guard people criminally, that is a good plan.
[02:29:23.966 --> 02:29:27.167]  But as for, you know, years ago, it's kind of like a Nacera 2.
[02:29:27.547 --> 02:29:28.388]  Everything's fixed.
[02:29:28.488 --> 02:29:29.948]  We've sent letters to the states.
[02:29:30.369 --> 02:29:32.029]  And in a month, the whole government's going to fall.
[02:29:32.069 --> 02:29:32.730]  And it didn't happen.
[02:29:33.230 --> 02:29:34.790]  The whole illegitimate government didn't leave.
[02:29:35.451 --> 02:29:39.953]  They are physically occupying every town and city to carry out this criminal takeover.
[02:29:40.033 --> 02:29:44.835]  We have to politically take all of our counties, cities, and states back from those positions.
[02:29:44.895 --> 02:29:47.296]  And then if the globalists try to ignore our states,
[02:29:48.715 --> 02:29:49.836]  Well, you know what comes next.
[02:29:51.217 --> 02:29:52.098]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.599 --> 02:29:54.200]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.141 --> 02:29:57.823]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.142 --> 02:30:05.766]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:30:06.146 --> 02:30:09.149]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:30:09.409 --> 02:30:14.173]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:30:14.193 --> 02:30:20.439]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:30:20.579 --> 02:30:22.822]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:30:23.362 --> 02:30:23.642]  Tim Geithner?
[02:30:23.662 --> 02:30:24.083]  Bernanke?
[02:30:24.183 --> 02:30:24.763]  They're arsonists!
[02:30:24.783 --> 02:30:25.604]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:30:25.944 --> 02:30:28.366]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:30:42.256 --> 02:30:49.163]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:30:49.543 --> 02:30:58.653]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:31:02.622 --> 02:31:06.243]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:06.583 --> 02:31:14.706]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:31:15.446 --> 02:31:19.487]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:31:20.067 --> 02:31:30.891]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:31:31.531 --> 02:31:40.533]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:41.033 --> 02:31:46.074]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:31:46.455 --> 02:31:53.636]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:53.956 --> 02:31:56.357]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:32:00.589 --> 02:32:01.730]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:32:01.770 --> 02:32:08.435]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:32:08.696 --> 02:32:10.977]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:32:11.238 --> 02:32:16.442]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:32:16.622 --> 02:32:19.404]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:32:19.664 --> 02:32:21.726]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:32:21.966 --> 02:32:27.909]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:32:28.229 --> 02:32:31.430]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:32:31.610 --> 02:32:37.133]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:32:37.393 --> 02:32:38.673]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:32:39.034 --> 02:32:40.174]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:32:40.314 --> 02:32:42.855]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:32:42.995 --> 02:32:44.416]  He explains everything you need to know.
[02:32:44.616 --> 02:32:45.037]  We're good to go.
[02:33:04.699 --> 02:33:10.883]  When your country is being turned into a 21st century banana republic police state.
[02:33:11.724 --> 02:33:14.465]  Silence isn't golden, it's yellow.
[02:33:15.166 --> 02:33:19.969]  You are listening to Alex Jones broadcasting live from the front lines.
[02:33:20.529 --> 02:33:24.172]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:40.882 --> 02:33:47.166]  Go back to your phone calls and then into some more of the news here in just a moment.
[02:33:47.186 --> 02:33:50.508]  But first, I want to tell you about eFoodsDirect.com.

[02:34:17.362 --> 02:34:18.382]  Quantities are limited.

[02:34:21.023 --> 02:34:23.124]  And I'm into storable food because I'm into it.

[02:35:59.457 --> 02:36:00.457]  Okay, let's hurry through calls.
[02:36:00.817 --> 02:36:02.038]  Nick in Missouri, you're on the air.
[02:36:02.058 --> 02:36:02.618]  Thanks for holding.
[02:36:03.533 --> 02:36:03.933]  Sold!
[02:36:04.294 --> 02:36:06.496]  Oh no, thanks Alex.
[02:36:06.596 --> 02:36:13.383]  First time caller is just uh, that was kind of weird you guys was talking earlier about them rolling it out right now.
[02:36:13.583 --> 02:36:23.813]  I've just watched helicopters landing all day long here in southeast Missouri and our armory here where I live is a transportation division so it's just loaded with trucks and humvees.
[02:36:25.552 --> 02:36:35.001]  Government kill switches, open borders, launching wars without congressional approval, $27 trillion given to foreign banks, won't tell Congress where it went.
[02:36:35.361 --> 02:36:37.383]  Yeah, we're already deep under martial law.
[02:36:37.663 --> 02:36:39.945]  They're just getting us ready to really gut us.
[02:36:40.626 --> 02:36:43.367]  Well, I've never seen this many just fly into town.
[02:36:43.407 --> 02:36:46.728]  I mean, I'm like a mile away from the armory and it's just nuts shaking my house.
[02:36:46.748 --> 02:36:48.128]  These huge helicopters, man.
[02:36:48.808 --> 02:36:50.829]  And I just thought I'd shout out to you.
[02:36:50.869 --> 02:36:56.290]  Well, the founders said don't have a standing army because they'll always be used against you and it looks like we're going to find out about it.
[02:36:56.350 --> 02:37:02.632]  They admit they're preparing the military to keep us safe during economic collapse when the bankers engineered the whole thing.
[02:37:03.649 --> 02:37:05.190]  Well, I don't know, man.
[02:37:05.490 --> 02:37:08.613]  I just hope they're not getting ready to start rolling down the streets right now.
[02:37:09.533 --> 02:37:10.354]  No, no, no, no.
[02:37:10.374 --> 02:37:15.257]  I don't really think I completely agree with LaRouche that this is going to happen really quick now.
[02:37:15.618 --> 02:37:20.261]  They're just keeping us down the same path of gang raping us, and it'll just slowly rot.
[02:37:20.581 --> 02:37:25.825]  That's how they want it, until they blow something up and say, you know, that foreign people did it or domestic groups did it.
[02:37:25.845 --> 02:37:27.666]  Alright.
[02:37:28.207 --> 02:37:30.088]  I appreciate it.
[02:37:30.248 --> 02:37:30.829]  Anything else, Nick?
[02:37:31.781 --> 02:37:33.304]  No, that's just that.
[02:37:33.344 --> 02:37:34.426]  I thought it was kind of strange.
[02:37:34.526 --> 02:37:38.492]  And then your intro right before I called in just kind of scared me since we're right here down the street.
[02:37:39.994 --> 02:37:40.716]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:37:40.756 --> 02:37:41.697]  Those are men and women.
[02:37:42.642 --> 02:37:45.865]  That are humans that are being raped by the system as well.
[02:37:46.685 --> 02:37:48.687]  It's time to talk to people in government.
[02:37:49.567 --> 02:37:50.748]  It's time to reach out to them.
[02:37:50.788 --> 02:37:55.152]  It's time to speak out and not just go with this outrageous foreign banking takeover.
[02:37:55.172 --> 02:38:02.958]  Hillary Clinton, Zbigniew Brzezinski and others are on record saying the globalists are in deep trouble and that people are identifying them, not the puppet front men.
[02:38:03.598 --> 02:38:05.720]  So that's why they're committed.
[02:38:06.561 --> 02:38:07.922]  That's why they're armed and dangerous.
[02:38:08.322 --> 02:38:09.183]  That's why they're wanted men.
[02:38:13.717 --> 02:38:15.558]  Henry Kissinger's wanted in a whole bunch of countries.
[02:38:16.218 --> 02:38:17.618]  So are people like George Soros.
[02:38:17.638 --> 02:38:18.699]  These are wanted men.
[02:38:19.099 --> 02:38:22.880]  They want the total tyranny so they can be secure in their crimes.
[02:38:24.240 --> 02:38:26.501]  And if we just wake up to these crooks, it's all over!
[02:38:27.041 --> 02:38:28.202]  And they know that's happening.
[02:38:28.222 --> 02:38:34.124]  That's why they're behind the scenes getting Homeland Security ready for gun owners and libertarians and people who don't like the Federal Reserve.
[02:38:34.424 --> 02:38:37.465]  Because they know we are the solution to the foreign occupation.
[02:38:38.905 --> 02:38:39.985]  Randy in Georgia.
[02:38:40.045 --> 02:38:41.006]  Randy, you're on the air.
[02:38:41.066 --> 02:38:41.386]  Welcome.
[02:38:42.589 --> 02:38:52.034]  Hi Alex, I was calling to let you know that the Census Bureau visited me on Friday, and they wanted me to take a survey.
[02:38:52.434 --> 02:38:53.594]  Of course I declined.
[02:38:53.694 --> 02:39:07.441]  Oh yeah, now they're saying they're going to be yearly, round the clock, there is no law, telling them what type of guns you have, how many toilets, when you go to work, what your stocks and bonds are, and they now admit it's going to be a yearly survey just because they can.
[02:39:08.658 --> 02:39:12.363]  Yeah, well actually on here it says that there's some that's on a monthly basis.
[02:39:13.244 --> 02:39:20.192]  Well that's right, I didn't want to say, you know, I say that I tend to lie subconsciously and unaware.
[02:39:21.173 --> 02:39:26.339]  Eleven years ago in the 2000 census, you can pull up mainstream news about this,
[02:39:27.861 --> 02:39:31.463]  And there was a federal judge in Texas, I remember seeing it in the Houston Chronicle, said this is illegal.
[02:39:31.623 --> 02:39:37.866]  Under the Constitution, they can ask how many people live there, and that's it, for congressional apportionment.
[02:39:38.286 --> 02:39:42.108]  To decide for your state's population how many members of the House of Representatives you get.
[02:39:42.408 --> 02:39:42.688]  That's it.
[02:39:43.308 --> 02:39:43.549]  Not.
[02:39:44.570 --> 02:39:46.994]  And then it was only one out of, I think, five families.
[02:39:47.074 --> 02:39:49.157]  I got one of them asking, what's your guns?
[02:39:49.217 --> 02:39:49.958]  What's your toilet?
[02:39:49.998 --> 02:39:50.759]  When do you go to work?
[02:39:51.400 --> 02:39:52.502]  Do you have renters that live here?
[02:39:52.542 --> 02:39:53.203]  Where do they work?
[02:39:53.724 --> 02:39:58.230]  And if you notice, it said federal law, you have to answer the question, but only on the first two questions.
[02:39:59.093 --> 02:40:03.095]  So they put the code under that, and the next three, four pages they didn't tell you.
[02:40:03.635 --> 02:40:11.058]  And they announced then, and then again two years ago, that it would be yearly, but some businesses and institutions and groups would get monthly.
[02:40:11.078 --> 02:40:16.941]  And then they said that, and again I subconsciously, I almost said monthly, but I...
[02:40:17.501 --> 02:40:21.883]  I thought people won't believe that, and I don't have time to pull it up, so I just said, well, it's going to be yearly.
[02:40:21.903 --> 02:40:26.206]  Because see, most folks are going to start getting the yearly, and so I guess it's true.
[02:40:26.306 --> 02:40:28.947]  Most of you only get a yearly, but then they're going to phase in a monthly.
[02:40:28.967 --> 02:40:31.589]  But yeah, yeah, tell folks about the piece of paper.
[02:40:31.769 --> 02:40:40.834]  I mean, we've shown it to people and stuff, but the point I'm making, Randy, is I tend to water things down, not even consciously, because I can't believe it myself either.
[02:40:42.555 --> 02:40:47.241]  Like, I knew this Marshall Law grab and Congress was coming, but it's still hard to believe it's happening.
[02:40:47.842 --> 02:40:49.704]  But, sorry Randy, go ahead.
[02:40:51.247 --> 02:41:09.706]  Well, it says, in addition, we collect data on a monthly basis to provide current information on such topics as unemployment rates, retail and wholesale trade, various manufacturing activities, and new housing construction, as well as yearly surveys on businesses, manufacturing, government, family income, health, and education.
[02:41:09.866 --> 02:41:11.128]  Now let me stop you again.
[02:41:11.568 --> 02:41:12.829]  Read the top of the form.
[02:41:13.389 --> 02:41:19.012]  In fact, I've had scores of these, and I've had the bad luck in the last two sentences to get the long one that says all that.
[02:41:19.072 --> 02:41:20.453]  I've shown it, but I think we threw it away.
[02:41:20.873 --> 02:41:26.616]  Why don't you scan that, and I'll put you on hold later and send it to my producers so I can show it tomorrow, because folks won't believe it.
[02:41:26.656 --> 02:41:32.360]  But read the top of the form, and start over, because yes, what you're reading is what it says.
[02:41:32.400 --> 02:41:33.380]  Yes, monthly.
[02:41:33.620 --> 02:41:39.904]  And so imagine, someone comes to your door from the government now, monthly, they GPS your door, and they demand to answer questions.
[02:41:40.725 --> 02:41:41.368]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:41:42.521 --> 02:41:58.647]  Um, well, the thing is, is that I guess she thought, because I'm a young mother, so I guess she thought I was the babysitter, and she left a note on the door, and I didn't receive it until my husband got home, saying that I'm obligated to return until contact has been made with an adult member of the household.
[02:41:58.987 --> 02:42:03.809]  So I called her, and I said, you did speak with an adult member, and I do not want to take the survey.
[02:42:03.849 --> 02:42:06.270]  And she was trying to tell me, oh, well, this is what the survey's about.
[02:42:06.290 --> 02:42:11.272]  I was like, well, I already read the pamphlet that you left on the door and the piece of paper you gave me.
[02:42:12.072 --> 02:42:13.393]  And we don't want to participate.
[02:42:13.453 --> 02:42:15.415]  And did she try the thing of, it's the law?
[02:42:15.435 --> 02:42:21.659]  Um, she didn't say that, but they were kind of upset because I was like, no, I don't want to take the server.
[02:42:21.699 --> 02:42:26.522]  They were like, oh, you know, this is, um, cause it was two, um, um, two women at the door.
[02:42:26.903 --> 02:42:28.724]  And I guess one of them was her supervisor.
[02:42:28.744 --> 02:42:30.025]  Yeah, you better watch yourself.
[02:42:30.065 --> 02:42:36.469]  They, they report, if you were dumb enough to let them in, that they see dog hair on the ground, a dish in the thing, they're going to take your kids.
[02:42:36.849 --> 02:42:39.932]  Government agents are vicious Nazi filth.
[02:42:40.552 --> 02:42:46.936]  Now they may individually, may not be, like somebody in the German Army, but they work for literal Beelzebub eugenicists.
[02:42:47.456 --> 02:42:52.319]  So remember, I don't answer the door when people come to my door if I don't know them and I don't have an appointment.
[02:42:52.799 --> 02:42:57.082]  And when they send me those because they're all fraudulent, they go in the trash can.
[02:42:57.742 --> 02:43:08.669]  Okay, if they pulled you over, ma'am, and you had a dead body in the back of your car, and the state police had you in there, and the FBI showed up, under the Constitution, you don't have to answer questions.
[02:43:08.929 --> 02:43:09.670]  Call the Fifth Amendment.
[02:43:10.030 --> 02:43:21.897]  Now, why then do they have a right to come give you a 50-question survey about when you go to work, what stocks and bonds you have, are you renting, what are your toilets like?
[02:43:22.017 --> 02:43:22.598]  They don't!
[02:43:23.118 --> 02:43:23.699]  They don't!
[02:43:24.079 --> 02:43:24.659]  They don't!
[02:43:24.960 --> 02:43:27.441]  But yes, they are trying to phase it out.
[02:43:27.461 --> 02:43:32.145]  And I've talked to people, I've seen it in the news, where they will force their way in now with the monthly surveys.
[02:43:32.525 --> 02:43:34.066]  They will actually, ugh, get me in there!
[02:43:34.287 --> 02:43:35.007]  You're going to answer it!
[02:43:35.387 --> 02:43:40.131]  And then they find good-looking women especially, and it's been coming out in the news, and they start harassing you.
[02:43:40.411 --> 02:43:43.594]  Because under their little authorization, they can start coming all the time.
[02:43:44.214 --> 02:43:46.716]  And so you just better not answer the door when they come.
[02:43:47.016 --> 02:43:51.720]  So how did it end when these little Gestapo officers were told that you're not going to answer their monthly survey?
[02:43:52.563 --> 02:43:53.644]  Well, I said no thank you.
[02:43:53.664 --> 02:43:57.309]  Then they tried to kind of persuade me and I basically had to shut the door in their face.
[02:43:57.709 --> 02:43:58.911]  Yeah, they're very dangerous.
[02:43:59.071 --> 02:44:00.192]  Just don't go to the door.
[02:44:00.553 --> 02:44:01.794]  You just say, I'm busy.
[02:44:02.235 --> 02:44:03.076]  I'm busy now.
[02:44:03.436 --> 02:44:03.977]  Thank you.
[02:44:04.277 --> 02:44:06.680]  And if they keep knocking, you say, I'm going to call the police.
[02:44:07.061 --> 02:44:11.967]  Again, it's your time, your country, your body, your children, your house.
[02:44:12.267 --> 02:44:13.248]  Get off my property!
[02:44:13.489 --> 02:44:13.709]  Get.
[02:44:14.029 --> 02:44:14.170]  Off.
[02:44:14.350 --> 02:44:14.550]  Get.
[02:44:14.870 --> 02:44:15.011]  Off.
[02:44:15.191 --> 02:44:15.371]  Get.
[02:44:15.671 --> 02:44:15.812]  Off.
[02:44:15.992 --> 02:44:16.192]  Get.
[02:44:16.493 --> 02:44:16.633]  Off.
[02:44:16.833 --> 02:44:21.199]  You can stick your thing in the mailbox, but don't even get them mad because they love to put people down.
[02:44:21.579 --> 02:44:22.781]  It's best to just say, I'm busy.
[02:44:22.881 --> 02:44:23.241]  Thank you.
[02:44:23.261 --> 02:44:24.223]  Well, what are you doing?
[02:44:24.243 --> 02:44:25.024]  None of your business.
[02:44:25.084 --> 02:44:25.905]  Thank you.
[02:44:25.925 --> 02:44:28.288]  Go CPS somebody else's kids.
[02:44:29.069 --> 02:44:30.210]  So, anything else, Randy?
[02:44:31.620 --> 02:44:40.868]  No, that was all, and it was in, I live in the Atlanta area, so, you know, for your callers that live in the Atlanta area, I don't know if they were just doing it on Friday or if they're going to do it... Ma'am, this is nationwide.
[02:44:41.209 --> 02:44:42.870]  Listen, this is nationwide.
[02:44:43.230 --> 02:44:44.452]  This is nationwide.
[02:44:44.492 --> 02:44:46.213]  It's an army of spy goons.
[02:44:46.754 --> 02:44:55.521]  They've announced that all the major mail carriers are going to have little tracker antennas on them that steal all your wireless data and track you.
[02:44:55.561 --> 02:44:57.203]  I mean, hell is being released.
[02:44:57.583 --> 02:44:59.587]  They got a million private spies in the U.S.
[02:44:59.627 --> 02:45:00.749]  under Homeland Security now.
[02:45:01.009 --> 02:45:02.392]  They're putting telescreens up.
[02:45:02.772 --> 02:45:03.734]  We know what we got.
[02:45:03.834 --> 02:45:06.038]  It's a case of hardable tyranny.
[02:45:07.160 --> 02:45:18.625]  I do have a question though, because when Mr. LaRouge was on, you all were speaking about how, with the foreclosed homes, they're bulldozing and they're going to build affordable housing.
[02:45:18.825 --> 02:45:21.025]  Do you think that has something to do with that?
[02:45:22.686 --> 02:45:23.867]  No, no, no.
[02:45:23.887 --> 02:45:25.627]  They want to gauge how bad they're hurting us.
[02:45:25.987 --> 02:45:27.288]  They say, we want this data to help you.
[02:45:27.628 --> 02:45:28.829]  They're already grabbing all the data.
[02:45:28.849 --> 02:45:37.817]  They're just creating armies of spies and getting the public accustomed to TSA sticking their hands down your pants, to people banging on your door and saying, answer my questions, or I'll call the SWAT team.
[02:45:38.217 --> 02:45:40.859]  It's about living in a Stasi East German system.
[02:45:41.119 --> 02:45:41.440]  No, no, no.
[02:45:42.592 --> 02:45:46.236]  JPMorgan and others are giving government people free houses they've taken.
[02:45:46.896 --> 02:45:48.238]  I was reading that from Time Magazine.
[02:45:48.258 --> 02:45:52.702]  They just, plain view, were giving government free houses, or discounted.
[02:45:53.122 --> 02:45:57.887]  And then they're bulldozing houses they've repossessed because they don't want to give them at a low price.
[02:45:58.187 --> 02:45:59.489]  They want to drive up prices.
[02:46:00.450 --> 02:46:01.751]  It's a destructive economy.
[02:46:02.071 --> 02:46:03.473]  It's designed to destroy things.
[02:46:03.513 --> 02:46:04.574]  I appreciate your call, Randy.
[02:46:04.934 --> 02:46:06.636]  Karen in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[02:46:07.657 --> 02:46:07.957]  Yes.
[02:46:08.037 --> 02:46:08.698]  Hi, Alex.
[02:46:10.058 --> 02:46:11.639]  Been a subscriber for quite some time.
[02:46:11.699 --> 02:46:12.360]  Love your show.
[02:46:12.380 --> 02:46:14.421]  I always tell everybody I can about it.
[02:46:16.222 --> 02:46:21.365]  This woman, I was going to talk about something else, but this woman that just came on, I was talking about somebody that came to her door.
[02:46:21.385 --> 02:46:23.867]  Well, we had people come to our door this morning, too.
[02:46:24.547 --> 02:46:29.130]  And they were from, the card is Independence Blue Cross.
[02:46:30.331 --> 02:46:32.152]  And my partner, who's disabled,
[02:46:32.959 --> 02:46:38.083]  They wanted to find out what meds, um, you know.
[02:46:38.103 --> 02:46:38.684]  Listen, listen.
[02:46:38.824 --> 02:46:40.605]  Number one, we're in a depression.
[02:46:40.625 --> 02:46:45.969]  There's roving bands of people breaking in houses, robbing, murdering, stealing any metal outside.
[02:46:46.450 --> 02:46:48.331]  Don't answer the door.
[02:46:48.772 --> 02:46:49.092]  Don't.
[02:46:49.412 --> 02:46:56.158]  If you don't have an appointment, and you don't, and everybody should drill a hole if they have to, you know, in the thing and put the eyepiece in there from Home Depot.
[02:46:57.322 --> 02:46:58.243]  Hey, I'm busy.
[02:46:58.383 --> 02:46:59.023]  Go away.
[02:46:59.424 --> 02:47:01.465]  Don't even open the stinking door.
[02:47:01.825 --> 02:47:05.368]  Yes, big insurance companies are out spying on people.
[02:47:05.748 --> 02:47:13.473]  Even if you don't have a membership with them or don't buy insurance from them, you're not a customer, they still want it for databases.
[02:47:13.914 --> 02:47:24.481]  Or they could have been, you know, there's all sorts of traveler groups now all over Europe, all over the U.S., from every different country you can imagine, you know, and they'll get you out
[02:47:24.741 --> 02:47:28.262]  You know, in the back while you're doing something, you know, oh, I want a tree trim for you.
[02:47:28.302 --> 02:47:30.983]  And then while you're busy, they're in your house robbing you.
[02:47:31.383 --> 02:47:36.225]  Do not talk to anybody that comes to your door.
[02:47:36.665 --> 02:47:37.846]  Do not do it.
[02:47:37.946 --> 02:47:39.126]  Do not do it.
[02:47:39.746 --> 02:47:43.728]  Chances, I mean, I've had countless people show up and they'll be total con artist criminals.
[02:47:44.368 --> 02:47:46.269]  And I'll open the door and I'll say, what are you doing here?
[02:47:47.225 --> 02:47:52.407]  And, you know, because they've been there when my wife's there, and she'd open the door, and they're like, oh, yeah, we've got a stereo system we want to sell you.
[02:47:52.427 --> 02:47:54.968]  And I go, listen, I'm calling the cops to know about your scam.
[02:47:55.688 --> 02:47:57.969]  And they'll be like, F you, they'll catch you later.
[02:47:58.149 --> 02:47:59.789]  And I'm like, well, I'm armed, slam the door.
[02:48:00.229 --> 02:48:02.570]  So there's just roving criminals everywhere.
[02:48:02.610 --> 02:48:03.290]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:48:04.851 --> 02:48:14.594]  You know, this super Congress, my question is to everyone out there is to think about why can't the Congress that we have now do the job?
[02:48:16.020 --> 02:48:18.521]  Because they won't vote the way the bankers want.
[02:48:19.141 --> 02:48:23.723]  Because they're slowly, oh, Congress gave up its trade authority to the World Trade Organization.
[02:48:23.803 --> 02:48:25.904]  Oh, Congress gave up its authority to this.
[02:48:26.264 --> 02:48:33.007]  They're openly, Republican leaders, two weeks ago, Mitch McConnell going, we'll just give the president the power of the purse now.
[02:48:33.427 --> 02:48:37.049]  And they had all these fake Republican talk show hosts go, what a genius idea!
[02:48:37.309 --> 02:48:38.269]  He'll get the blame!
[02:48:38.429 --> 02:48:39.830]  They're not allowed to give it up.
[02:48:40.670 --> 02:48:42.391]  So, that's what they're doing, Karen.
[02:48:43.681 --> 02:48:44.641]  It's a big scam.
[02:48:44.981 --> 02:48:47.382]  It's a big... And I just wanted to say the last thing.
[02:48:47.422 --> 02:48:55.604]  I live in Philadelphia and, you know, I grew up, you know, understanding that the Constitution was written here and I felt a great sense of pride.
[02:48:56.924 --> 02:49:03.665]  But when I saw that they actually built a museum for the Constitution to be put in, I knew that it was dead.
[02:49:05.006 --> 02:49:05.686]  Absolutely.
[02:49:05.706 --> 02:49:08.366]  They call it the Al-Qaeda-tution now.
[02:49:08.706 --> 02:49:09.747]  I appreciate your call.
[02:49:09.827 --> 02:49:10.807]  Anything good is evil.
[02:49:11.793 --> 02:49:22.321]  And they got armies of people getting out of college in the military who want jobs, and they're brought in behind closed doors, and they literally say, to see who freaks out and leaves, George Washington's bad.
[02:49:22.501 --> 02:49:26.845]  I have it on video, Roger Tierney, FEMA teaching police, George Washington's bad, he's scum!
[02:49:27.185 --> 02:49:28.746]  And the guys are like, yeah, yeah, yeah!
[02:49:29.326 --> 02:49:30.687]  They're like, why is he a terrorist?
[02:49:30.747 --> 02:49:33.329]  And the cops start saying it, and FEMA goes, good!
[02:49:34.229 --> 02:49:35.489]  These people are our enemies!
[02:49:38.330 --> 02:49:41.171]  And a few of them kind of freak out, but they're watching.
[02:49:41.751 --> 02:49:42.271]  They're watching.
[02:49:42.291 --> 02:49:45.112]  They're sitting there in the multi-day course, writing it down.
[02:49:45.192 --> 02:49:46.052]  Oh, you don't like that?
[02:49:46.512 --> 02:49:47.632]  Put him in a database.
[02:49:48.372 --> 02:49:49.753]  He doesn't hate George Washington.
[02:49:49.773 --> 02:49:52.133]  I mean, this is how the hardcore criminals operate.
[02:49:52.673 --> 02:49:53.734]  And they're just getting started.
[02:49:53.754 --> 02:49:54.714]  That's why I'm so angry.
[02:49:55.194 --> 02:49:58.515]  I'm so just wanting to get people awake so we can beat these hardcore criminals.
[02:49:59.055 --> 02:50:00.575]  Let's jam in Dennis as we got a break.
[02:50:00.615 --> 02:50:01.355]  We may hold him over.
[02:50:01.615 --> 02:50:03.536]  Dennis and Tejas, go ahead, evil one.
[02:50:04.454 --> 02:50:05.614]  Yes, I'm very evil.
[02:50:06.515 --> 02:50:07.275]  I'm an engineer.
[02:50:07.295 --> 02:50:10.496]  I know that 9-11 was an inside job.
[02:50:10.896 --> 02:50:12.276]  I've listened to you for years.
[02:50:12.356 --> 02:50:17.738]  I was very skeptical about what you represented and everything.
[02:50:17.798 --> 02:50:19.278]  I've been to Afghanistan.
[02:50:19.318 --> 02:50:20.298]  I've been to Iraq.
[02:50:20.378 --> 02:50:26.360]  I've been down to your protest in front of the Austin Police Department.
[02:50:26.400 --> 02:50:30.701]  I was down at the protest and saw you at the Capitol Building.
[02:50:30.721 --> 02:50:32.962]  And I'm convinced, Alex,
[02:50:34.938 --> 02:50:41.065]  I actually want to speak to someone that is listening to your program.
[02:50:43.187 --> 02:50:48.613]  The guy that called in and gave you the idea for the Google bomb?
[02:50:48.914 --> 02:50:50.656]  Yes, he's in Michigan.
[02:50:50.696 --> 02:50:51.557]  I think his name's Tim.
[02:50:52.799 --> 02:50:56.761]  But there's another way to actually get a lot of... Stay there!
[02:50:56.781 --> 02:50:58.062]  I want to hear this after the break!
[02:50:58.082 --> 02:50:58.762]  Stay there!
[02:50:58.802 --> 02:51:00.563]  We'll be back with Dennis in Austin.
[02:51:01.004 --> 02:51:01.904]  You've been lied to.
[02:51:02.224 --> 02:51:07.067]  Lied to by the Wall Street propaganda machine, the government, and the talking heads in the media.
[02:51:07.507 --> 02:51:09.088]  The market is in for another crash.
[02:51:09.388 --> 02:51:15.031]  Real estate is already in a double-dip recession, and if you want to keep your hard-earned money safe, this message is for you.
[02:51:15.511 --> 02:51:20.994]  My name is Brett Kitchen, and after losing 35% of my money when the market crashed, I said enough is enough.
[02:51:21.514 --> 02:51:29.803]  I searched and discovered a way to safely grow my money, participate in potential double-digit gains, but also have my money protected when the crashes come.
[02:51:30.203 --> 02:51:32.666]  Plus, it could save you thousands in taxes.
[02:51:33.146 --> 02:51:40.233]  I want you to get a free copy of my new book, Safe Money Millionaire, where I share this powerful tool that people like Walt Disney and J.C.
[02:51:40.293 --> 02:51:42.476]  Penney used to safely grow their wealth.
[02:51:42.956 --> 02:51:44.078]  Call 1-800-675-1640 right now to get your free copy.
[02:51:44.098 --> 02:51:44.918]  Again, that's 1-800-675-1640.
[02:51:44.939 --> 02:51:47.722]  I'm giving away a limited number of copies today, so call 1-800-675-1640.
[02:52:00.583 --> 02:52:04.606]  You don't need me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis.
[02:52:05.026 --> 02:52:06.247]  Everyone can feel it.
[02:52:06.528 --> 02:52:14.974]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[02:52:15.415 --> 02:52:18.597]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising.
[02:52:18.857 --> 02:52:19.718]  But take heart.
[02:52:19.898 --> 02:52:23.421]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[02:52:23.701 --> 02:52:28.685]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war.
[02:52:29.085 --> 02:52:32.626]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[02:52:32.926 --> 02:52:34.366]  The globalists are scared.
[02:52:34.646 --> 02:52:35.646]  They've overreached.
[02:52:35.986 --> 02:52:39.127]  The future of the info war is in your hands.
[02:52:39.487 --> 02:52:41.527]  Join PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:52:41.767 --> 02:52:47.728]  Download the thousands of special video reports, e-books, and more, and get them out to everyone you know.
[02:52:47.908 --> 02:52:54.690]  Continue to spread the word about the broadcast on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and every other globalist propaganda platform.
[02:52:54.870 --> 02:52:56.970]  We are going to use their system against them.
[02:52:57.150 --> 02:53:00.151]  The InfoWar now goes into high gear!
[02:53:00.931 --> 02:53:01.431]  Question.
[02:53:01.751 --> 02:53:05.692]  Can functional magnetic resonance imaging be used to read our minds?
[02:53:06.352 --> 02:53:11.773]  Author Jose Calazo answers yes in his two new books, America's New Slavery.
[02:53:12.053 --> 02:53:17.514]  For more than 13 years, author Jose Calazo has been trying to prove that the U.S.
[02:53:17.574 --> 02:53:22.655]  government has the capacity to read a person's thoughts with a revolutionary technology
[02:53:22.975 --> 02:53:29.016]  Known as FMRI, Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and there is proof that it exists.
[02:53:29.456 --> 02:53:35.957]  America's New Slavery explores this technology and its many possible applications in national security.
[02:53:36.238 --> 02:53:37.458]  Who has access to it?
[02:53:37.818 --> 02:53:38.938]  How is it being used?
[02:53:39.238 --> 02:53:42.279]  Does America's salvation rest in this technology?
[02:53:42.559 --> 02:53:49.240]  These and many other questions are answered in America's New Slavery, the new books by Jose Collazo.
[02:53:49.680 --> 02:53:54.570]  Available on BN.com, Amazon.com, and Borders.com.
[02:53:54.950 --> 02:53:56.593]  America's New Slavery.
[02:53:57.054 --> 02:53:59.198]  All Americans should be concerned.
[02:54:26.098 --> 02:54:31.862]  By the way, I could have spent all day just on the video that we shot and produced over the weekend.
[02:54:32.382 --> 02:54:37.545]  We basically worked most of the weekend, Friday night right through Sunday evening.
[02:54:38.146 --> 02:54:41.788]  I was up here at, you know, I don't know, eight thirty, nine o'clock last night.
[02:54:44.110 --> 02:54:45.430]  Getting all of this done.
[02:54:46.787 --> 02:54:49.289]  And Aaron Dykes did an incredible job.
[02:54:49.349 --> 02:54:50.930]  It's Obama launches gun grab.
[02:54:51.470 --> 02:54:56.454]  Outside of Congress, we have the clips of Congress going, we're gonna get this law passed to restrict the Second Amendment.
[02:54:56.794 --> 02:55:00.476]  And then they couldn't get it passed, so they just say, hey, who needs Congress?
[02:55:00.596 --> 02:55:02.177]  Who needs badges?
[02:55:02.197 --> 02:55:05.340]  It's like from the Three Amigos, we don't need no stinking badges.
[02:55:05.360 --> 02:55:08.021]  It's like, we don't need no stinking Constitution.
[02:55:08.201 --> 02:55:09.282]  We'll launch wars.
[02:55:09.642 --> 02:55:13.365]  We'll create a new Congress of 12 members that'll run all this with the bankers.
[02:55:14.165 --> 02:55:14.606]  It's happening.
[02:55:15.652 --> 02:55:21.778]  And if the ATF can get away with this, Obama's announced he's going to sign executive orders putting you on no-buy list.
[02:55:23.220 --> 02:55:24.201]  Just like the no-fly list.
[02:55:24.281 --> 02:55:25.182]  No judge, no jury.
[02:55:26.043 --> 02:55:27.084]  They're not playing games.
[02:55:27.644 --> 02:55:30.547]  So please go to Infowars.com and get this out to everybody you know.
[02:55:31.068 --> 02:55:33.810]  It's time to admit America got a case of tyranny.
[02:55:34.211 --> 02:55:35.092]  Just like you get the flu.
[02:55:36.403 --> 02:55:38.343]  Or it's like going to the doctor and you got cancer.
[02:55:38.364 --> 02:55:42.284]  I mean, we better cut this out, ladies and gentlemen, and stop living in denial.
[02:55:42.344 --> 02:55:44.985]  It's not a virtue to be a bunch of gullible idiots.
[02:55:45.925 --> 02:55:49.686]  So Obama launches gun grab, LinkedIn red, front page of InfoWars.com.
[02:55:50.006 --> 02:55:52.087]  Please get that video out to everyone.
[02:55:54.728 --> 02:55:57.628]  I should have even done a Google bomb, but anything with Obama's name in it, they block.
[02:55:59.009 --> 02:56:00.529]  We can still do them with archaic names.
[02:56:00.549 --> 02:56:03.550]  Going back and finishing up with Dennis in Texas.
[02:56:03.570 --> 02:56:04.450]  Dennis, what's your idea?
[02:56:05.734 --> 02:56:14.022]  Well, Alex, you're doing a human's job, and it's time that people recognize that we're being attacked on all sides.
[02:56:14.822 --> 02:56:20.067]  This criminal government, you've got Obama in there, he isn't even a U.S.
[02:56:20.127 --> 02:56:20.628]  citizen.
[02:56:20.688 --> 02:56:23.750]  I know people will argue about that, but it's been proven he's not a U.S.
[02:56:23.830 --> 02:56:24.211]  citizen.
[02:56:24.867 --> 02:56:27.748]  He should be completely thrown out.
[02:56:27.788 --> 02:56:30.489]  He should be impeached by the Congress.
[02:56:30.549 --> 02:56:33.950]  The Congress is too busy fooling around with other things.
[02:56:34.010 --> 02:56:37.511]  They should be taking up the ATF situation.
[02:56:37.551 --> 02:56:40.572]  They should be taking up the Obama birth certificate situation.
[02:56:41.373 --> 02:56:44.154]  And they're confusing us with all their criminality.
[02:56:46.514 --> 02:56:49.075]  You had a good vehicle at one time.
[02:56:49.095 --> 02:56:53.017]  You could go ahead and do Google bombs and now they're thwarting you.
[02:56:54.173 --> 02:56:59.057]  And with that tool, they're able to circumvent you a little bit.
[02:56:59.678 --> 02:57:07.444]  It's time that people stand up and actually take this government on, but surreptitiously.
[02:57:09.346 --> 02:57:22.777]  There are a lot of entry points into the emergency broadcast system, and there are people out there that know exactly what I'm talking about, and if they could just patch you in one or two times,
[02:57:24.149 --> 02:57:27.111]  That would throw a real scare into the powers that be.
[02:57:27.131 --> 02:57:29.032]  Yeah, that'd probably send a hit team down here.
[02:57:29.352 --> 02:57:37.776]  Let me be clear, jacking into emergency alert systems is part of the national security system, and I've seen the laws on that.
[02:57:37.796 --> 02:57:41.458]  That would be a serious felony hacking case, but I appreciate your call.
[02:57:42.198 --> 02:57:44.079]  I do not recommend people do that.
[02:57:46.020 --> 02:57:48.541]  Now, putting banners up everywhere?
[02:57:48.641 --> 02:57:49.882]  You'll get your whole town talking.
[02:57:50.882 --> 02:57:58.106]  You know, with serious, provocative terms, and then a website, calling into talk radio, a local newsletter, running for city council.
[02:57:58.166 --> 02:58:00.367]  Even if you lose, you'll be able to inject real issues.
[02:58:00.907 --> 02:58:14.235]  It's about, look, a lot of people want to do big, powerful, titanous, superhero-type things where everything is done at once.
[02:58:15.171 --> 02:58:17.012]  But the tyrants have taken over incrementally.
[02:58:17.032 --> 02:58:19.332]  We're going to destroy their system incrementally.
[02:58:19.852 --> 02:58:21.133]  Now, there are some really great things.
[02:58:21.153 --> 02:58:26.134]  I mean, people have done big banner hangs off skyscrapers, and it's gotten national attention.
[02:58:27.074 --> 02:58:28.835]  But I don't want people to do anything that's illegal.
[02:58:30.515 --> 02:58:32.796]  Do what you feel is right and within the law.
[02:58:33.656 --> 02:58:36.097]  Of course, pretty soon they're going to claim free speech is illegal.
[02:58:36.117 --> 02:58:38.177]  They're already trying, so then you've got to break the law, don't you?
[02:58:38.517 --> 02:58:39.798]  See you back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[02:58:39.838 --> 02:58:40.178]  Central.
[02:58:43.451 --> 02:58:45.315]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
