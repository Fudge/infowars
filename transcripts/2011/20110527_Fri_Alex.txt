[00:00:05.868 --> 00:00:10.071]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.692 --> 00:00:11.492]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.293 --> 00:00:13.194]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.834 --> 00:00:17.417]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:22.080]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.141 --> 00:00:26.143]  Welcome, everybody.
[00:00:26.243 --> 00:00:28.205]  It is Friday, May 27, 2011.
[00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:33.389]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:34.509]  Alex is off today.
[00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:35.570]  My name is Mike Adams.
[00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.671]  I'm filling in for Alex.
[00:00:37.351 --> 00:00:41.554]  I'm known as the Health Ranger, the editor of NaturalNews.com, and today we're going to be breaking down
[00:00:42.395 --> 00:00:47.237]  A number of just fascinating and somewhat horrifying stories, you might say.
[00:00:47.437 --> 00:01:03.281]  Of course, we're going to be covering the TSA tyranny, the latest developments in that realm, including a news report now posted on PrisonPlanet.com about veterans being inappropriately touched, you might say molested, by TSA agents.
[00:01:03.301 --> 00:01:09.743]  We also have a list of the top 10 things that the TSA could do if their power is not limited.
[00:01:10.064 --> 00:01:11.184]  This is a crucial question.
[00:01:11.684 --> 00:01:15.607]  The TSA essentially claims that there are no limits to its power.
[00:01:16.307 --> 00:01:19.169]  Well, we disagree, and I think many constitutionalists would disagree.
[00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:21.350]  We're going to break that down right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:01:21.831 --> 00:01:24.132]  We also have some newspaper archives from 1986.
[00:01:24.593 --> 00:01:30.576]  If that year rings a bell, it's because that's the year that Chernobyl went into a total meltdown.
[00:01:31.137 --> 00:01:32.378]  Now, what's fascinating about this
[00:01:33.198 --> 00:01:41.242]  Is that back in 1986, scientists were talking about half a million people dying over the next couple of decades from Chernobyl.
[00:01:41.542 --> 00:01:50.346]  They were talking about the real dangers of radioactive fallout, whereas today, in great contrast to that, everybody's downplaying it and saying, what?
[00:01:50.707 --> 00:01:51.407]  What radiation?
[00:01:51.467 --> 00:01:52.067]  What fallout?
[00:01:52.287 --> 00:01:59.991]  Keep drinking your milk, keep sending those school children right up there to the edge of the nuclear reactors, it seems, in Fukushima.
[00:02:00.051 --> 00:02:01.372]  No worries, don't worry about it.
[00:02:02.452 --> 00:02:18.715]  We've got news about Big Pharma's influence over medical doctors, a new research study that just came out that shows that drug companies essentially buy influence, they buy their way into the minds of physicians who are prescribing drugs to you and your children.
[00:02:18.995 --> 00:02:24.697]  We also have breaking news about GMOs, new research, shocking research showing that 93%
[00:02:26.837 --> 00:02:27.197]  Of course!
[00:02:46.403 --> 00:02:50.564]  Many of those are contaminated unintentionally with GMOs.
[00:02:50.584 --> 00:02:53.944]  The contamination is so widespread, it's across the planet.
[00:02:54.324 --> 00:02:56.925]  This is a war on our food supply.
[00:02:56.945 --> 00:02:58.525]  This is a war on our seeds.
[00:02:59.005 --> 00:03:01.986]  This is a war on sustainable life on our planet.
[00:03:02.346 --> 00:03:07.767]  And we're going to be breaking that down right here on the Alex Jones Show at the top of the next hour.
[00:03:08.307 --> 00:03:11.348]  We also have some news for you today on FTC tyranny.
[00:03:11.368 --> 00:03:13.248]  Yes, the Federal Trade Commission.
[00:03:14.008 --> 00:03:18.011]  And it's secret war on natural product companies.
[00:03:18.471 --> 00:03:22.514]  The FTC has gone after manufacturers of cherry products.
[00:03:23.174 --> 00:03:25.575]  They're going after today the Palm Wonderful company.
[00:03:25.595 --> 00:03:28.437]  Yeah, the company that sells the pomegranate juice.
[00:03:29.098 --> 00:03:35.262]  Well, that company's in trouble now because of the so-called crime of telling the truth.
[00:03:35.962 --> 00:03:47.468]  Yeah, it's a crime in America today, according to the FTC and even the FDA, to tell the truth about the health benefits, the scientifically proven health benefits of a natural substance.
[00:03:47.508 --> 00:03:53.491]  You can't even talk about how pomegranate juice can help prevent prostate cancer, for example, or improve heart health.
[00:03:53.911 --> 00:03:58.954]  If you do that, you're going to be hauled into a private court, an illegal court,
[00:03:59.494 --> 00:04:00.735]  known as the FTC court.
[00:04:00.815 --> 00:04:07.198]  I call it a kangaroo court where you have no due process, you have no constitutional rights, you have no trial by jury, nothing.
[00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:11.401]  So we're going to be talking about that right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:11.641 --> 00:04:26.169]  So we have a really full couple of hours of breaking news here and this is a short segment here but when we come back from the break we are going to get into the top ten things that the TSA could do if its power is not limited.
[00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:27.790]  Let me tell you about the
[00:04:29.577 --> 00:04:35.144]  What the TSA has done now, the TSA thugs grabbed the crotch of an injured vet.
[00:04:35.905 --> 00:04:43.193]  This is coming out of, this is on PrisonPlanet.com right now, TSA agents grabbing two veterans
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.023]  Grabbing them in the crotch area and screaming, what are you hiding in your face?
[00:04:48.503 --> 00:04:54.568]  One of them had shrapnel in his face because he was injured serving his country and fighting for freedom instead of charity.
[00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:57.110]  Stay with us right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.011]  More on the other side of this break.
[00:04:59.111 --> 00:04:59.572]  Stay with us.
[00:05:02.896 --> 00:05:04.657]  And you're subject to other police action.
[00:05:05.437 --> 00:05:06.357]  Tyranny is here.
[00:05:06.697 --> 00:05:10.218]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:05:10.238 --> 00:05:12.839]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:05:12.859 --> 00:05:18.300]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:24.962]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:05:25.402 --> 00:05:30.947]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:05:31.367 --> 00:05:35.030]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.574]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:05:39.834 --> 00:05:45.358]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:05:45.799 --> 00:05:48.781]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:05:49.342 --> 00:05:50.763]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:05:51.323 --> 00:05:51.764]  It's here.

[00:06:01.609 --> 00:06:07.031]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:06:08.272 --> 00:06:13.034]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:06:13.395 --> 00:06:20.138]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:24.293]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:06:26.195 --> 00:06:28.057]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:06:28.117 --> 00:06:34.524]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:06:35.245 --> 00:06:38.289]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.161]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:06:42.421 --> 00:06:43.922]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:06:44.202 --> 00:06:46.763]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:06:47.083 --> 00:06:53.346]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:06:53.707 --> 00:06:55.928]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:06:56.428 --> 00:06:58.449]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[00:06:58.789 --> 00:06:59.270]  Others don't.
[00:07:00.811 --> 00:07:05.054]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:07:05.374 --> 00:07:05.975]  Number 1.
[00:07:06.275 --> 00:07:09.437]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:07:09.718 --> 00:07:10.258]  Number 2.
[00:07:10.578 --> 00:07:15.122]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:07:15.462 --> 00:07:15.902]  It's true.
[00:07:16.202 --> 00:07:20.766]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:07:21.086 --> 00:07:21.606]  Number 3.
[00:07:21.907 --> 00:07:25.189]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:07:25.489 --> 00:07:29.192]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:07:29.392 --> 00:07:29.933]  Number 4.
[00:07:30.193 --> 00:07:32.555]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:07:32.935 --> 00:07:36.338]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:07:36.618 --> 00:07:36.839]  Number 5.
[00:07:37.419 --> 00:07:41.342]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:07:41.563 --> 00:07:46.327]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:07:46.607 --> 00:07:50.630]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:52.351]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:52.571 --> 00:07:54.652]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:07:54.812 --> 00:07:57.434]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:08:02.717 --> 00:08:08.741]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.362 --> 00:08:12.344]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:14.249 --> 00:08:18.251]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on Friday, May 27th, here at 2011.
[00:08:19.511 --> 00:08:24.514]  I'm the fill-in host today for Alex Jones, Mike Adams, the health ranger, the editor of NaturalNews.com.
[00:08:24.834 --> 00:08:27.995]  I cover a lot of health freedom issues and TSA tyranny.
[00:08:28.696 --> 00:08:32.638]  Just like Alex Jones covers, we overlap on a lot of topics.
[00:08:33.058 --> 00:08:39.081]  We're going to be covering TSA today, GMOs, and many other important topics with some breaking news that I think will
[00:08:39.941 --> 00:08:41.622]  Really make you wonder what's going on out there.
[00:08:42.202 --> 00:08:45.143]  Well, hey, if you're an Alex Jones Show listener, you already know what's going on.
[00:08:45.183 --> 00:08:58.647]  We're just going to give you more details about it so that you can really understand behind the scenes, under the power system, how are they manipulating the world and making these things happen without the mainstream public waking up?
[00:08:59.187 --> 00:09:04.150]  Well, to start that off, by the way, I'm wearing an InfoWars.com t-shirt today.
[00:09:04.511 --> 00:09:08.233]  That's my show of support for the Alex Jones Show and the great work that this crew does here.
[00:09:08.253 --> 00:09:11.495]  Yeah, here we go, here at the Alex Jones Studios.
[00:09:11.655 --> 00:09:15.418]  And really, wear these t-shirts because they're great conversation starters.
[00:09:16.198 --> 00:09:17.799]  And it shows that you're informed.
[00:09:18.259 --> 00:09:22.082]  So you can go to InfoWars.com and pick up a t-shirt.
[00:09:22.102 --> 00:09:23.803]  There are a lot of different messages on the t-shirts.
[00:09:23.843 --> 00:09:28.185]  I'm going to start wearing these around as well, just to see what people say.
[00:09:28.245 --> 00:09:30.327]  May probably meet some pretty cool people doing that.
[00:09:31.167 --> 00:09:33.168]  Getting to the TSA, here's the question.
[00:09:33.809 --> 00:09:38.953]  Now, the TSA, if you recall, has cited the Supremacy Clause of the U.S.
[00:09:39.013 --> 00:09:43.656]  Constitution as its authority to do basically anything it wants.
[00:09:44.316 --> 00:09:48.580]  This is why the TSA is now conducting searches at high school prom dances.
[00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:55.244]  Yeah, the TSA reaching up the dresses and down the pants of your teenage daughters and sons?
[00:09:55.865 --> 00:09:56.365]  Seriously?
[00:09:56.545 --> 00:09:57.386]  At high school dances?
[00:09:57.426 --> 00:09:58.527]  This is what's really going on.
[00:09:59.247 --> 00:10:08.132]  They could be searching you at shopping malls, at sporting events, at bus stations, not just airports, and they claim that they have absolute power to do that.
[00:10:08.532 --> 00:10:12.914]  They do not recognize the limits of power that they should recognize.
[00:10:13.314 --> 00:10:20.458]  So the question that I bring to you today right here on the Alex Jones Show is, what are the limits of power to the TSA?
[00:10:21.778 --> 00:10:23.659]  Is there a document somewhere that limits the power?
[00:10:23.859 --> 00:10:29.182]  Does the TSA admit that it has any boundaries whatsoever to the things that it could do?
[00:10:29.862 --> 00:10:38.807]  Now, those of you out there who are constitutional scholars will, of course, rightly mention that there are already documents that limit the TSA's power and authority.
[00:10:39.307 --> 00:10:41.628]  And those documents, well, two of them are, of course, the U.S.
[00:10:41.668 --> 00:10:44.010]  Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:48.291]  And these set out very specific limits to the TSA's power.
[00:10:49.052 --> 00:10:50.412]  Specifically, the Fourth Amendment.
[00:10:50.692 --> 00:10:54.634]  And you could argue also the Tenth Amendment states rights should limit federal power.
[00:10:54.914 --> 00:10:56.694]  But the TSA doesn't recognize any of that.
[00:10:57.314 --> 00:10:59.695]  It says the Fourth Amendment basically is null and void.
[00:10:59.935 --> 00:11:01.036]  Essentially, that's what it's saying.
[00:11:02.016 --> 00:11:12.380]  Now, if the TSA follows this line of non-reasoning, this tyrannical philosophy of absolute power, you have to wonder, where could it go?
[00:11:13.556 --> 00:11:18.118]  And in considering that, I penned a top ten list last night.
[00:11:18.158 --> 00:11:21.880]  This is posted up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:24.101]  It's also posted on NaturalNews.com.
[00:11:24.981 --> 00:11:28.282]  Ten things the TSA could do if its power is not limited.
[00:11:28.322 --> 00:11:30.683]  And I'm going to go through this list with you right here.
[00:11:31.023 --> 00:11:35.785]  But I want you to understand that these are not just pie-in-the-sky exaggerations.
[00:11:35.845 --> 00:11:41.568]  These are logical progressions of what the TSA could do if it doesn't recognize limits to its own power.
[00:11:42.128 --> 00:11:52.491]  Number one, it could start conducting house-to-house searches without any warrants, without any justification, just like the Indiana police have now threatened to do because of the state Supreme Court decision there.
[00:11:53.092 --> 00:11:56.653]  The TSA could be doing this all in the name of security.
[00:11:56.753 --> 00:11:57.193]  That's right.
[00:11:57.933 --> 00:11:59.013]  Open your door, sir.
[00:11:59.474 --> 00:12:00.234]  Open your door, ma'am.
[00:12:00.274 --> 00:12:03.375]  We're coming in to protect you from terrorists.
[00:12:04.595 --> 00:12:05.055]  Get a warrant?
[00:12:05.095 --> 00:12:05.876]  No, we don't need a warrant.
[00:12:05.896 --> 00:12:06.496]  We're the TSA.
[00:12:07.554 --> 00:12:12.057]  They could shut down your state's highways, railroads, or airports at any time.
[00:12:12.578 --> 00:12:21.944]  They've already threatened to do that in Texas, to shut down all of the airports in the state of Texas to essentially blockade air traffic in and out of the state.
[00:12:22.805 --> 00:12:28.868]  That's an act, I believe, of economic terrorism, or at least it's a threat of economic terrorism.
[00:12:29.388 --> 00:12:30.888]  The TSA could do this to any state.
[00:12:31.489 --> 00:12:40.012]  They could threaten this in order to get their way with those states to make sure that they have absolute power to do whatever they want, which could include house-to-house searches.
[00:12:40.532 --> 00:12:45.014]  Number three, they could conduct body cavity searches at polling stations.
[00:12:45.074 --> 00:12:46.055]  Now, I apologize.
[00:12:46.455 --> 00:12:48.516]  I'm not going to make this too graphic.
[00:12:49.056 --> 00:12:49.917]  But think about it.
[00:12:50.237 --> 00:12:52.919]  They're already doing lewd, obscene pat-downs.
[00:12:53.379 --> 00:13:01.085]  They could extend this to polling stations and say, before you vote, you've got to come in and submit to a complete body cavity search.
[00:13:01.626 --> 00:13:02.746]  You know, hey, you want to vote today?
[00:13:02.766 --> 00:13:09.992]  There's only one candidate on the poll today, and that's Mr. Ben Dover, if you'll allow me to put in that bit of satire.
[00:13:10.252 --> 00:13:13.615]  But it's not funny, because they could literally be doing this.
[00:13:14.675 --> 00:13:15.416]  They could be doing this.
[00:13:15.656 --> 00:13:18.879]  They're already violating our bodies and they're violating our constitutional rights.
[00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:20.541]  They could take this even further.
[00:13:21.642 --> 00:13:33.873]  Number four, they could search parking lots for cars that contain Ron Paul bumper stickers and then just impound those vehicles under suspicion that those people are dangerous patriots.
[00:13:34.694 --> 00:13:40.198]  Oh my goodness, if you have a Ron Paul bumper sticker on your car, it must be dangerous because you think for yourself.
[00:13:40.916 --> 00:13:42.056]  That's what the TSA believes.
[00:13:42.477 --> 00:13:45.258]  Number five, the TSA could begin carrying firearms.
[00:13:45.818 --> 00:14:00.544]  They could actually say, hey, we're going to act like law enforcement officers, even though we're not sworn law enforcement officers, even though we have no training on firearms, or the safe use of firearms, or the safe use of force against the public.
[00:14:00.984 --> 00:14:03.185]  They have no training on that, or minimal training.
[00:14:04.105 --> 00:14:05.806]  They could demand to start carrying firearms.
[00:14:05.846 --> 00:14:07.466]  Can you imagine what these people would do?
[00:14:07.486 --> 00:14:10.267]  They're already putting, planting cocaine in your luggage.
[00:14:10.988 --> 00:14:15.629]  They're already feeling you up and feeling you down, putting you down, feeling you up.
[00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:19.071]  They're messing with you in every way they can think of.
[00:14:19.311 --> 00:14:22.192]  Can you imagine if they have guns in your face doing it at the same time?
[00:14:22.972 --> 00:14:26.554]  It won't be long before the TSA is starting to ask for those guns, I believe.
[00:14:26.574 --> 00:14:30.875]  That's going to be a very scary day in America if we don't stop this before that happens.
[00:14:31.256 --> 00:14:39.019]  Number six, they could demand to install TSA representatives in local sheriff's offices and police departments.
[00:14:39.479 --> 00:14:40.800]  Now the KGB did this.
[00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:43.121]  Hitler did this.
[00:14:43.681 --> 00:14:44.441]  He had his SS
[00:14:46.004 --> 00:14:54.551]  Which were not just military, but political spies installed in offices all around the German Empire at that time.
[00:14:55.172 --> 00:14:56.653]  The TSA could demand this as well.
[00:14:56.693 --> 00:15:10.185]  Hey, we're going to have a TSA representative, right, in your local sheriff's office just to make sure that you're on board with our anti-terrorism efforts, which really mean clamping down on the rights and the freedoms of the American people.
[00:15:11.328 --> 00:15:19.072]  Number seven, the TSA could announce a fee collection mandate, where when you go through security, you've got to slip them a $20 bill.
[00:15:19.772 --> 00:15:21.733]  That's right, you've got to pay for a pat-down.
[00:15:21.753 --> 00:15:27.716]  I'm not sure, some people might actually want to pay for that, but most wouldn't.
[00:15:30.877 --> 00:15:34.359]  This could get into some crazy realms, maybe some of these TSA agents
[00:15:35.612 --> 00:15:36.333]  Would get tips.
[00:15:37.174 --> 00:15:37.674]  I doubt it.
[00:15:38.075 --> 00:15:45.121]  I think they would actually get screamed at and threatened more than getting tipped, but they could actually demand that you pay them while they molest you.
[00:15:46.002 --> 00:15:46.843]  How's that for tyranny?
[00:15:47.163 --> 00:15:48.425]  That could be happening in America.
[00:15:48.445 --> 00:15:49.986]  There's no reason why they couldn't do that right now.
[00:15:50.026 --> 00:15:58.354]  You know, have your $20 bill ready to go right through airport security, hand it over to an agent in anticipation of your pat down.
[00:15:59.406 --> 00:15:59.986]  Crazy stuff.
[00:16:15.034 --> 00:16:15.614]  We're good to go.
[00:16:44.386 --> 00:16:51.030]  All right, number eight, the TSA could demand veto power over all state legislation involving security.
[00:16:51.671 --> 00:17:00.417]  And then any states that did not comply with that veto power granting to the TSA could be boycotted by the TSA, which means no air traffic in and out of your state.
[00:17:00.837 --> 00:17:01.357]  Think about that.
[00:17:01.738 --> 00:17:06.020]  The TSA could just say, hey, we need oversight on any security related legislation.
[00:17:06.281 --> 00:17:10.543]  And if you don't pass the laws that we want you to pass, then we're not going to let your airports operate.
[00:17:11.024 --> 00:17:12.365]  I mean, they're close to doing that right now.
[00:17:12.385 --> 00:17:14.146]  I think they did that to Texas.
[00:17:14.907 --> 00:17:16.409]  I think number eight has already happened.
[00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:18.231]  I guess we've got to modify the list.
[00:17:18.312 --> 00:17:25.181]  Nine things that could happen, one thing that just did happen because they threatened Texas with a complete air traffic blockade.
[00:17:25.582 --> 00:17:31.089]  Number nine, the TSA could set up official TSA naked inspection rooms.
[00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:36.014]  At the airports where the officials take travelers into the back room and make them disrobe.
[00:17:36.074 --> 00:17:38.296]  Now, look, they're already doing the naked body scanners.
[00:17:38.657 --> 00:17:53.010]  Now, they can claim, well, the scanner saw a shadow of something next to your hip, or the scanner doesn't have quite enough resolution, or we don't want to expose you to too much radiation, so we don't want to scan you again.
[00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:55.572]  Instead, we're going to make you disrobe in the back room.
[00:17:55.973 --> 00:17:56.133]  Well,
[00:17:57.093 --> 00:17:57.713]  They could do that.
[00:17:58.033 --> 00:17:58.874]  They could demand that.
[00:18:00.014 --> 00:18:05.716]  If you're out there listening to this and thinking that they wouldn't do that, then my question to you is, what would stop them?
[00:18:06.576 --> 00:18:07.336]  What would stop them?
[00:18:08.817 --> 00:18:16.039]  What would you do to stand up and stop them if they began having the naked security disrobe rooms in the back?
[00:18:16.839 --> 00:18:18.140]  In the back of those security checkpoints.
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.401]  I mean, what's to stop them from doing that right now?
[00:18:20.421 --> 00:18:21.361]  And the answer is nothing.
[00:18:23.035 --> 00:18:33.120]  Number 10, they could visit local malls and sporting arenas and businesses and they could demand, they could demand that local business owners pay TSA protection fees.
[00:18:33.981 --> 00:18:34.481]  That's right.
[00:18:34.841 --> 00:18:44.727]  If they want to keep their events safe from terrorists, if you don't want your sporting arena bombed by terrorists, they might say, you need to pay a TSA protection fee.
[00:18:45.646 --> 00:18:55.075]  Now if that sounds familiar, it's because that's of course what every mob organization did in the history of the mob throughout America and many other countries.
[00:18:55.115 --> 00:18:56.096]  It was a protection fee.
[00:18:56.316 --> 00:19:02.321]  They knock on your door, hey business owner, give us 10% of your profits or there might be an accident.
[00:19:03.022 --> 00:19:04.443]  Somebody might bomb your restaurant.
[00:19:06.442 --> 00:19:07.183]  Or your mall.
[00:19:07.723 --> 00:19:10.524]  You gotta pay us a protection fee and then we'll keep you safe.
[00:19:10.844 --> 00:19:11.964]  That's how rackets work.
[00:19:12.825 --> 00:19:17.366]  And that's why the TSA is really an illegal organization.
[00:19:17.406 --> 00:19:19.267]  I think it's a criminal organization right now.
[00:19:20.187 --> 00:19:24.629]  And if they could get into these realms and these realms could really threaten our freedoms.
[00:19:25.129 --> 00:19:32.352]  So that's why we've got to start standing up right now against the TSA and demanding that they abide by the limits.
[00:19:33.425 --> 00:19:39.488]  Set out under the Constitution and under the Bill of Rights, the limits to government power that are already in place.
[00:19:41.149 --> 00:19:44.671]  Because those limits are the only thing that guarantee our freedom.
[00:19:46.812 --> 00:19:47.673]  Whoa, how we doing?
[00:19:50.515 --> 00:19:53.276]  Sorry guys, we just had a little audio blip here.
[00:19:53.296 --> 00:19:54.717]  Alright.
[00:20:01.345 --> 00:20:04.827]  What if you could enjoy a refreshing cigarette without worrying about your health?
[00:20:05.088 --> 00:20:05.728]  Great news!

[00:21:30.635 --> 00:21:39.901]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:21:39.961 --> 00:21:40.702]  This capitalism?
[00:21:40.762 --> 00:21:46.906]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:21:47.026 --> 00:21:47.847]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:21:47.887 --> 00:21:51.009]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[00:21:51.149 --> 00:21:51.929]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[00:21:51.949 --> 00:21:53.310]  It's time to understand the system.

[00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:53.951]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:22:03.557 --> 00:22:05.478]  Alex Jones here with key information.
[00:22:05.879 --> 00:22:06.379]  The U.S.
[00:22:06.439 --> 00:22:13.184]  government is a Ponzi scheme that relies on the Treasury continuously selling large amounts of government bonds to foreign central banks.
[00:22:13.724 --> 00:22:16.366]  With Japan about to become a seller of U.S.
[00:22:16.446 --> 00:22:19.688]  bonds in order to rebuild its own nation, and the U.S.
[00:22:19.768 --> 00:22:26.373]  antagonizing China by calling them currency manipulators, the Federal Reserve, which is already buying about 70% of U.S.
[00:22:26.433 --> 00:22:29.035]  Treasuries, will soon be the only buyer left of U.S.
[00:22:29.075 --> 00:22:29.515]  Treasuries.
[00:22:29.915 --> 00:22:33.377]  Our friends at the National Inflation Association believe that the U.S.
[00:22:33.437 --> 00:22:38.999]  dollar will soon become worthless and Americans will see the purchasing power of their incomes and savings destroyed.
[00:22:39.379 --> 00:22:47.363]  I strongly urge my fellow Americans to sign up for the free NIA newsletter at www.inflation.us.
[00:22:47.843 --> 00:22:57.208]  If you are sick and tired of the economic propaganda in the mainstream media, sign up for free at inflation.us to learn the economic truth that the mainstream media ignores.
[00:23:00.663 --> 00:23:02.764]  You've heard a lot lately about zeolite.
[00:23:03.004 --> 00:23:05.125]  But what is it, and why do you need it?
[00:23:05.645 --> 00:23:10.606]  Zeolite is a beautiful, complex, crystalline structure that encapsulates radiation and odors.
[00:23:11.147 --> 00:23:18.869]  Zeoking zeolite naturally eliminates radiation poisoning your body may pick up from x-rays, security scanners, or nuclear fallout.

[00:23:46.804 --> 00:23:48.924]  For natural elimination of radiation poisoning.
[00:24:13.203 --> 00:24:13.663]  Welcome back.
[00:24:13.683 --> 00:24:15.444]  You are listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:15.464 --> 00:24:18.304]  I'm the fill-in host today, Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[00:24:18.324 --> 00:24:30.368]  We've been talking about the TSA tyranny and how the TSA does not recognize any limits to its power and why it has to be limited if we're going to stop this rise of what could be a very dangerous organization.
[00:24:31.516 --> 00:24:33.358]  for the future of America.
[00:24:50.274 --> 00:24:55.778]  Looked at what the media was saying about Chernobyl in the aftermath of that meltdown.
[00:24:55.818 --> 00:25:02.082]  We have some interesting things going on because think about the contrast today with Fukushima in a meltdown.
[00:25:02.122 --> 00:25:09.587]  Not just one meltdown, but three of the nuclear facilities there, of the nuclear cores, have melted down, now admitted by TEPCO.
[00:25:10.307 --> 00:25:18.839]  We have many, many times more stored nuclear fuel rods at the Fukushima facility than they were ever stored at Chernobyl.
[00:25:19.379 --> 00:25:25.247]  We have Fukushima emptying, dumping radiation directly into the ocean water, which never happened at Chernobyl.
[00:25:25.868 --> 00:25:38.714]  In fact, the whole situation at Fukushima is not even under control, and it is by any measure far worse than what Chernobyl ever was, and yet today we're being told, don't worry, don't worry about the nuclear fallout from Fukushima, keep drinking that milk.
[00:25:38.914 --> 00:25:46.898]  Hey, the EPA and the FDA have stopped testing for the most part, and even the testing that the EPA does conduct isn't reliable, doesn't work very well.
[00:25:47.981 --> 00:25:50.364]  It's almost like they don't want you to know what the tests are going to tell you.
[00:25:50.965 --> 00:25:54.069]  So anyway, okay, so we have a headline from 1986.
[00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:54.990]  U.S.
[00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:57.493]  doctor says Chernobyl cancer toll may reach 75,000.
[00:25:57.954 --> 00:26:06.645]  Alright, so this is from, this is a story out of Vienna, Austria here, and it was carried by the Associated Press.
[00:26:07.947 --> 00:26:25.034]  And here we go, this is right out of the, this is a blast from the past right here, talking about, but this was a low number for what they thought might happen in the aftermath of Chernobyl, because another headline from the Pharaoh's Tribune in Indiana says Chernobyl could cause 500,000 deaths.
[00:26:28.075 --> 00:26:31.436]  500,000 people will develop fatal malignancies.
[00:26:31.876 --> 00:26:36.778]  An additional 470,000 people will develop cancers that can be effectively treated.
[00:26:37.258 --> 00:26:42.780]  This is from a cancer expert who studied the effects of radiation.
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:45.080]  Again, this is following Chernobyl in 1986.
[00:26:47.401 --> 00:26:55.869]  And he said, quote, it's futile to hope for a safe dose of radiation that will not induce cancer in humans.
[00:26:56.409 --> 00:26:57.110]  That's a quote from 1986.
[00:26:58.291 --> 00:26:59.892]  You won't hear that in the newspaper today.
[00:26:59.932 --> 00:27:02.594]  You won't see that on the mainstream media today.
[00:27:02.935 --> 00:27:05.957]  If you say that on mainstream news, they will not have you back.
[00:27:06.798 --> 00:27:08.179]  Because that's too scary.
[00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:10.081]  All of a sudden, radiation's safe.
[00:27:10.201 --> 00:27:15.405]  I mean, radiation was dangerous in 1986, and now in 2011, suddenly it's safe.
[00:27:15.806 --> 00:27:21.310]  And they're adjusting all the levels of allowed exposure to radiation too, because the levels have somehow changed.
[00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:24.132]  I guess, I guess the EPA
[00:27:24.953 --> 00:27:30.237]  And the leadership in America thinks that the laws of physics have changed since 1986.
[00:27:31.558 --> 00:27:38.184]  Somehow, these magicians in Washington have waved a magic wand and altered the laws of physics.
[00:27:38.644 --> 00:27:39.304]  It's amazing!
[00:27:39.525 --> 00:27:42.967]  Hey, if you can do that, we don't even need nuclear fuel.
[00:27:42.987 --> 00:27:46.390]  You can just generate power from nothing, I guess, if you can wave your magic wand.
[00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:48.392]  Now, next story from 1986, the Daily Herald.
[00:27:50.253 --> 00:27:55.678]  From September 10, 1986, one million people may get cancer from Chernobyl.
[00:27:56.078 --> 00:28:03.325]  And for those watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, we have the clips from these newspapers right there on screen so you can see them.
[00:28:03.345 --> 00:28:05.306]  You can see we're not making this up.
[00:28:06.047 --> 00:28:09.770]  This is Dr. John Goffman of the University of California at Berkeley.
[00:28:10.391 --> 00:28:16.235]  He told scientists at the 192nd Annual Meeting of the American Chemical Society.
[00:28:16.776 --> 00:28:17.556]  Can you believe this?
[00:28:18.317 --> 00:28:26.784]  At a meeting at the American Chemical Society, they have a guy who admits that fallout from Chernobyl could cause a million people to get cancer.
[00:28:27.584 --> 00:28:29.386]  Well, you can bet this guy won't be invited back.
[00:28:29.746 --> 00:28:30.687]  I wonder where he is today.
[00:28:31.027 --> 00:28:31.528]  He says,
[00:28:32.762 --> 00:28:38.271]  He says that the radiation from the reactor from Chernobyl was carried by the wind all over Europe.
[00:28:39.568 --> 00:28:46.652]  And all across the world, and he says cancer may occur as a direct result in at least 20 countries, including the United States.
[00:28:47.313 --> 00:28:48.814]  Yep, that's the news from 1986.
[00:28:50.135 --> 00:28:54.958]  Once again, fast forward to 2011, and we're told, no problem!
[00:28:55.498 --> 00:28:56.779]  No problem in the U.S.
[00:28:57.319 --> 00:28:58.480]  We don't even need to test it.
[00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:00.161]  You don't have to worry about it.
[00:29:00.961 --> 00:29:01.622]  It's amazing.
[00:29:02.182 --> 00:29:06.905]  Amazing how the reaction to these disasters changes depending on whose country blows up.
[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:11.243]  Who, depending on who built the reactors.
[00:29:11.263 --> 00:29:13.467]  You know, that was part of the story of Chernobyl.
[00:29:14.068 --> 00:29:15.330]  The Soviets built the reactors.
[00:29:15.431 --> 00:29:18.396]  Oh, the Soviets, they don't know what they're doing was sort of the message back then.
[00:29:18.436 --> 00:29:20.119]  The sloppy engineers, they don't know what they're doing.
[00:29:20.928 --> 00:29:26.391]  What happens when Fukushima blows up, melts down because of engineers from the U.S.?
[00:29:27.071 --> 00:29:27.711]  They cover it up.
[00:29:28.252 --> 00:29:29.092]  Don't want to tell you the truth.
[00:29:29.592 --> 00:29:30.253]  All right, stay with us.
[00:29:30.293 --> 00:29:38.117]  On the other side of this break, we're going to be joined by Paul Joseph Watson, who's going to help us learn more about TSA tyranny and freedom.
[00:29:38.937 --> 00:29:40.218]  Stay with us here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:29:51.496 --> 00:29:54.497]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.437 --> 00:29:58.177]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.278 --> 00:30:03.779]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:03.999 --> 00:30:09.020]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:10.660]  Saving means to make money.

[00:30:20.362 --> 00:30:27.467]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:30:27.908 --> 00:30:35.513]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:30:35.914 --> 00:30:40.817]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[00:31:02.125 --> 00:31:05.749]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:31:06.149 --> 00:31:09.152]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:31:09.372 --> 00:31:14.156]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:31:14.176 --> 00:31:20.402]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:31:20.562 --> 00:31:22.805]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:31:23.345 --> 00:31:23.625]  Tim Geithner?
[00:31:23.645 --> 00:31:24.065]  Bernanke?
[00:31:24.165 --> 00:31:24.766]  They're arsonists!
[00:31:24.826 --> 00:31:26.086]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:31:26.106 --> 00:31:28.347]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:31:42.253 --> 00:31:49.180]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:58.650]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:32:00.669 --> 00:32:03.451]  It could never happen in America, but it's happening right now.
[00:32:03.652 --> 00:32:06.995]  Gas prices are exploding past the incomes of millions of families.
[00:32:07.275 --> 00:32:13.760]  As gas prices and crop failures push high food costs, you can still get the best food on the planet from eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:32:13.901 --> 00:32:19.065]  Demand for food is high, but eFoodsDirect has plenty of radiation-free food to meet your needs.

[00:33:07.128 --> 00:33:09.330]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:23.645]  This is Mike Adams filling in for Alex Jones today and we're about to be joined by Paul Joseph Watson to talk about the new resolution in Congress to extend some pretty wild powers to the President to conduct war globally.
[00:33:24.406 --> 00:33:27.008]  Paul's going to be joining us in just a second on that.
[00:33:27.048 --> 00:33:28.949]  I just want to thank you all for joining us today.
[00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:35.434]  We are working very hard here, the whole team, to bring you this information and keep you informed in every way possible.
[00:33:35.914 --> 00:33:50.785]  And that's why I'm very excited to be joined here by Paul Joseph Watson, who is also a fill-in host on this show from time to time, but an outstanding writer, investigator, and editor of many of the articles that you find written on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:33:53.747 --> 00:33:55.348]  Paul Watson, are you with us?
[00:33:56.649 --> 00:33:57.810]  Great to be with you, Mike.
[00:33:58.550 --> 00:33:59.471]  Good to be on the air today.
[00:33:59.611 --> 00:34:00.911]  It's great to have you on.
[00:34:02.693 --> 00:34:14.360]  What is happening out there with the War Powers Resolution, and what is it that people need to know about what's coming down the line as a threat to not just their freedom, but the powers of the U.S.
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:14.760]  Congress?
[00:34:16.459 --> 00:34:19.620]  Paul, this is what we're talking about on the website today.
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:21.720]  We just got the article out about an hour ago.
[00:34:22.261 --> 00:34:27.342]  Obama's promise to veto a worldwide war bill rings hollow.
[00:34:27.782 --> 00:34:38.605]  Now, this worldwide war provision is a component of the National Defense Authorization Act, which has already passed the House and is on its way to the Senate right now.
[00:34:39.207 --> 00:35:01.965]  And it would basically allow Obama or any future president to authorize worldwide war with no expiration date and of course anywhere on the globe at any time without congressional authorization, which of course, as people familiar with the Constitution will know, is a complete violation of the War Powers Act.
[00:35:02.768 --> 00:35:08.832]  So basically, it gives Obama or any future president complete dictator status.
[00:35:09.552 --> 00:35:12.794]  They don't have to say why they're doing it, they don't have to give a pretext.
[00:35:13.375 --> 00:35:18.838]  It's perpetual warfare, George Orwell 1984 style.
[00:35:19.679 --> 00:35:26.123]  It's being called by the ACLU, who in fact have been tricked on this, we can get into that in a moment.
[00:35:26.603 --> 00:35:35.432]  They called it, quote, the single biggest handover of unchecked war authority from Congress to the executive branch in modern American history.
[00:35:36.333 --> 00:35:43.720]  And now we have a clip of one call where he slams this as the final nail in the coffin of the American Republic.
[00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:45.122]  So let's roll that clip.
[00:35:48.125 --> 00:35:49.066]  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[00:35:50.549 --> 00:35:59.535]  The last nail is being driven into the coffin of the American Republic, yet Congress remains in total denial as our liberties are rapidly fading before our eyes.
[00:35:59.995 --> 00:36:04.358]  The process is propelled by unwarranted fear and ignorance as to the true meaning of liberty.
[00:36:04.838 --> 00:36:09.141]  It is driven by economic myths, fallacies, and irrational good intentions.
[00:36:09.781 --> 00:36:16.506]  The rule of law is constantly rejected, and authoritarian answers are offered as panaceas for all our problems.
[00:36:17.146 --> 00:36:17.646]  We're good to go.
[00:36:36.773 --> 00:36:38.535]  We're good to go.
[00:36:54.099 --> 00:36:57.040]  Enforce indefinite imprisonments without due process.
[00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:01.321]  Order searches and seizures without proper warrants, gutting the Fourth Amendment.
[00:37:01.741 --> 00:37:08.942]  Ignore the 60-day rule for reporting to the Congress the nature of any military operation as required by the War Power Resolution.
[00:37:09.683 --> 00:37:12.423]  Continue the Patriot Act abuses without oversight.
[00:37:12.943 --> 00:37:14.724]  Wage war at will.
[00:37:15.364 --> 00:37:20.545]  Treat all Americans as suspected terrorists at airports with TSA groping and nude x-raying.
[00:37:22.233 --> 00:37:31.917]  And the Federal Reserve accommodates by counterfeiting the funds needed and not paid for by taxation and borrowing, permitting runaway spending, endless debt, and special interest bailouts.
[00:37:32.858 --> 00:37:34.359]  And all of this is not enough.
[00:37:34.679 --> 00:37:43.983]  The abuses and usurpations of the war power are soon to be codified in the National Defense Authorization Act, now rapidly moving its way through Congress.
[00:37:44.623 --> 00:37:57.327]  Instead of repealing the 2001 authorization for the use of military force, as we should, now that Bin Laden is dead and gone, Congress is planning to massively increase the war power of the President.
[00:37:57.927 --> 00:38:10.932]  Though an opportunity presents itself to end the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, Congress, with bipartisan support, obsesses on how to expand the unconstitutional war power of the President.
[00:38:11.312 --> 00:38:12.172]  He already holds.
[00:38:12.672 --> 00:38:19.716]  The current proposal would allow a president to pursue war anytime, anyplace, for any reason, without congressional approval.
[00:38:19.976 --> 00:38:25.759]  Many believe this would even permit military activity against American suspects here at home.
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:30.142]  The proposed authority does not reference the 9-11 attacks.
[00:38:30.542 --> 00:38:41.568]  It would be expanded to include the Taliban and associated forces, a dangerously vague and expansive definition of our potential enemies.
[00:38:42.475 --> 00:38:55.102]  There is no denial that the changes in Section 1034 totally eliminates the hard-fought-for restraint on presidential authority to go to war without congressional approval achieved at the Constitutional Convention.
[00:38:58.155 --> 00:39:07.758]  Congress's war authority has been severely undermined since World War II, beginning with the advent of the Korean War, which was fought solely under a UN resolution.
[00:39:08.458 --> 00:39:17.461]  Even today, we're waging war in Libya without even consulting with the Congress, similar to how we went to war in Bosnia in the 1990s under President Clinton.
[00:39:18.341 --> 00:39:33.847]  The three major reasons for our constitutional conventions were to guarantee free trade and travel among the states, make gold and silver legal tender, and abolish paper money, and strictly limit the executive branch's authority to pursue war without congressional approval.
[00:39:34.547 --> 00:39:39.009]  But today, Federal Reserve notes are legal tender, gold and silver are illegal.
[00:39:39.709 --> 00:39:45.074]  The Interstate Commerce Clause is used to regulate all commerce at the expense of the free trade among the states.
[00:39:45.594 --> 00:39:57.345]  And now, the final nail is placed in the coffin of Congressional responsibility for the war power, delivering this power completely to the President, a sharp and huge blow to the concept of our Republic.
[00:39:58.045 --> 00:40:06.809]  In my view, it appears that the fate of the American Republic is now sealed, unless these recent trends are quickly reversed.
[00:40:07.569 --> 00:40:15.413]  The saddest part of this tragedy is that all these horrible changes are being done in the name of patriotism and protecting freedom.
[00:40:16.053 --> 00:40:17.254]  They are justified
[00:40:18.115 --> 00:40:23.819]  By good intentions, while believing the sacrifice of liberty is required for our safety.
[00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:26.081]  Nothing could be further from the truth.
[00:40:26.722 --> 00:40:41.933]  More sadly is the conviction that our enemies are driven to attack us for our freedoms and prosperity and not because of our deeply flawed foreign policy that has generated justifiable grievances and has inspired the radical violence against us.
[00:40:42.394 --> 00:40:43.635]  Without this understanding,
[00:40:44.255 --> 00:40:44.775]  That was Ron Paul.
[00:40:57.557 --> 00:41:15.006]  With what is quickly becoming known as the final nail in the coffin speech where he warns that the end of our republic may be near with this just obscene surrender of congressional power to the executive branch of government.
[00:41:15.826 --> 00:41:20.670]  And joining us here, of course, to continue this discussion is Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:21.870]  And Paul, I have a question for you.
[00:41:21.970 --> 00:41:30.637]  Why does Congress feel that it needs to grant the President this power when the Presidents, ever since World War II, have just been assuming this power anyway?
[00:41:30.677 --> 00:41:37.001]  I mean, Bush and Obama and many Presidents before, they never went to Congress to ask for a declaration of war.
[00:41:37.321 --> 00:41:38.022]  So what's going on?
[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:40.381]  Well, exactly, Mark.
[00:41:40.481 --> 00:41:43.604]  I mean, it's usually the case with these things.
[00:41:43.644 --> 00:41:47.567]  They're merely codifying and justifying what they're already doing.
[00:41:48.088 --> 00:42:00.579]  We know that the Obama administration has aggressively accelerated the drone attacks that they've used in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Yemen, and other countries without recourse.
[00:42:00.619 --> 00:42:04.162]  You know, they just violate the airspace of sovereign countries.
[00:42:04.642 --> 00:42:05.603]  We're good to go.
[00:42:22.723 --> 00:42:24.204]  Well then isn't this the whole...
[00:42:40.824 --> 00:42:41.605]  I'm sorry to interrupt.
[00:42:41.945 --> 00:42:43.807]  The whole point, can you speak to this?
[00:42:44.027 --> 00:42:44.387]  Why?
[00:42:44.587 --> 00:42:49.531]  Why does Congress, why was Congress granted the power to declare war and not the executive branch?
[00:42:49.591 --> 00:42:52.694]  And why we need to maintain that status?
[00:42:54.495 --> 00:43:05.604]  Well, because to have a legal, justifiable war, you need a pretext that's credible enough to, you know, send the soldiers away to fight and die for American freedom.
[00:43:06.105 --> 00:43:09.948]  When no such pretext or justification exists,
[00:43:10.569 --> 00:43:22.941]  You basically get a situation which has repeated itself throughout history, where dictators and tyrants go off on global conquest, like Hitler and Napoleon and Stalin and all the rest of them.
[00:43:23.001 --> 00:43:33.610]  So that's why it was enshrined in the War Powers Act, which restricts the president from doing this, that they have to get authorization from Congress.
[00:43:34.271 --> 00:43:36.313]  But the point that we're seeing with this is
[00:43:37.546 --> 00:43:49.889]  The claim that Obama, and this is the ACLU coming out with this, is planning to veto this National Authorization Act if it includes this worldwide war provision that we're talking about.
[00:43:50.449 --> 00:43:52.650]  And basically they fell for it big time.
[00:43:53.370 --> 00:44:00.252]  If you read the actual letter that the White House sent to Congress in which they threatened to veto this resolution,
[00:44:00.979 --> 00:44:09.524]  The Obama administration isn't opposed to the bill because it's an egregious, you know, expansion of federal power of the executive branch.
[00:44:10.004 --> 00:44:22.971]  They're opposed to it because it doesn't give the executive branch enough power, and yet the ACLU took this as an example of the Obama administration standing up for the rule of law.
[00:44:23.511 --> 00:44:28.034]  So they're saying it doesn't give the executive branch the power to choose between
[00:44:28.855 --> 00:44:32.738]  Either prosecuting these alleged terrorists or merely murdering them on a whim.
[00:44:33.519 --> 00:44:43.166]  So when you come to a compromise on this legislation, which is what the White House is seeking, they're only going to try and strengthen this worldwide war resolution.
[00:44:43.207 --> 00:44:44.287]  They're not going to weaken it.
[00:44:45.088 --> 00:44:50.732]  And I mean, you were talking about why Congress needs this, why it's happened in the past.
[00:44:51.373 --> 00:44:52.454]  I mean, look at Libya.
[00:44:53.740 --> 00:44:54.160]  I don't
[00:45:11.825 --> 00:45:19.192]  Well, this gets into the realm of word games and mind games where Obama said it was kinetic action and not a war.
[00:45:19.653 --> 00:45:30.182]  And I suppose any future president can play the same mind games or word games, linguistic trickery, and say that as they're bombing some foreign nation, it's not a war either.
[00:45:30.202 --> 00:45:34.046]  I mean, there are so many levels at which they can deceive the public on this issue.
[00:45:35.834 --> 00:45:46.756]  Well, it's Orwellian to say the least, and the deception in this case is this idea that Obama is going to veto it because it's some hideous, ghastly law, which it is.
[00:45:47.276 --> 00:45:50.257]  But they're trying to veto it because it's not strong enough for them.
[00:45:50.597 --> 00:45:56.418]  And that's in their own letter they sent to Congress, yet the ACLU is telling people that it's for a completely different reason.
[00:45:56.959 --> 00:45:59.099]  But, I mean, you mentioned Libya again.
[00:46:00.099 --> 00:46:03.460]  Senator Rand Paul came out, I believe it was last week,
[00:46:04.102 --> 00:46:08.304]  Because it was 60 days after the bombardment of Libya began.
[00:46:08.904 --> 00:46:22.149]  Now, of course, the War Powers Act directly states that after the expiration of this 60-day period, the President needs to go to Congress and get explicit approval for any war.
[00:46:22.669 --> 00:46:26.630]  But, I mean, what did Obama do when Rand Paul brought this up?
[00:46:27.070 --> 00:46:31.472]  You know, he nearly turned his nose up and claimed his authority came from the UN.
[00:46:32.152 --> 00:46:32.693]  I think so.
[00:46:51.932 --> 00:46:56.474]  Exaltation of international law only applies when it suits him.
[00:46:56.935 --> 00:46:59.836]  You know, he wants to have his cake and eat it.
[00:47:00.256 --> 00:47:09.041]  So it's basically, again, Mr. War is Peace Obama, you know, the man who has more troops deployed than George W. Bush ever did.
[00:47:09.722 --> 00:47:10.383]  It's incredible.
[00:47:10.403 --> 00:47:12.785]  Where is the anti-war movement on this?
[00:47:13.005 --> 00:47:16.709]  Because imagine if, let's say, Bush were still president today and this kind of
[00:47:29.942 --> 00:47:33.026]  Action was being taken by Congress to give Bush this power.
[00:47:33.366 --> 00:47:43.378]  The anti-war movement would have gone crazy over this, saying we can't give these war powers to a president, but why is it okay with the anti-war movement that Obama gets these war powers?
[00:47:43.799 --> 00:47:48.024]  They don't realize what can happen down the road with future presidents using the same power.
[00:47:49.790 --> 00:47:50.711]  Well, that's the thing, Mike.
[00:47:50.771 --> 00:47:55.396]  I mean, the ACLU is telling all the liberals that Obama's against this.
[00:47:55.797 --> 00:48:00.482]  Because he's standing up for the rule of law and democracy.
[00:48:00.862 --> 00:48:02.584]  Well, you know, first time for everything.
[00:48:02.945 --> 00:48:08.471]  But then you go and read the actual letter that the White House sent to Congress, and it's got nothing to do with
[00:48:09.508 --> 00:48:18.672]  Them being concerned about the fact that this authority for worldwide war is, you know, this massive unrestrained expansion of executive power.
[00:48:19.092 --> 00:48:33.457]  All they're concerned about is they still want the choice to try terrorist suspects in federal court, but they also want the power to just go out and execute anyone who they want, which they did a few weeks ago with this so-called Biddle Argent raid, if you believe it.
[00:48:34.187 --> 00:48:44.916]  So the ACLU is telling the Liberals that Obama's against all this, when he's got more troops out there than George W. Bush, when he's bombing Libya with no Congressional oversight.
[00:48:45.417 --> 00:48:50.101]  And as he said, it seems that these anti-war people, or these left-wingers,
[00:48:50.621 --> 00:49:07.656]  I only realize that they've been backstabbed, backstabbed by Democrats like Obama when it's too late because they still can't get it through their thick heads that these presidents only ever serve the military-industrial complex and not the people of the United States of America.
[00:49:07.861 --> 00:49:11.404]  Well, it just shows you how few people actually operate on principle today.
[00:49:11.885 --> 00:49:27.380]  That is a very rare breed of an American human being, an American citizen, who operates on principle today, and not to even mention an American member of Congress who operates on principle, because these are principles that we're dealing with here, folks.
[00:49:27.620 --> 00:49:28.261]  Well, exactly, and I mean,
[00:49:55.106 --> 00:49:59.350]  Placing your trust in the White House to veto this is just not going to cut it.
[00:49:59.910 --> 00:50:01.592]  I mean, it's past the House.
[00:50:02.252 --> 00:50:03.493]  It's going to the Senate.
[00:50:03.553 --> 00:50:08.377]  People need to lobby their Senators like mad to try and get this out.
[00:50:08.658 --> 00:50:11.140]  They'll probably debate the provision for a while.
[00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:13.082]  That's what the White House said they were going to do.
[00:50:13.102 --> 00:50:16.845]  But as I said, they're only trying to make it stronger.
[00:50:18.046 --> 00:50:22.390]  So in the course of that debate, during that delay, we need to bring this to
[00:50:23.797 --> 00:50:28.700]  Certainly nationwide and global attention to try and get this worldwide war resolution out there.
[00:50:29.101 --> 00:50:31.782]  Which is not to say that they're already doing it.
[00:50:32.103 --> 00:50:32.543]  They are.
[00:50:32.703 --> 00:50:33.343]  There are attacks.
[00:50:33.383 --> 00:50:34.404]  There are attacks.
[00:50:34.584 --> 00:50:38.407]  Is there a chance that we can stop this in the Senate or is it almost a done deal?
[00:50:40.008 --> 00:50:45.151]  I don't think it's a done deal because the White House is saying they want to debate this provision.
[00:50:45.952 --> 00:50:50.294]  Not because they don't like it but it's not a done deal yet so it's time to stop it.
[00:50:50.334 --> 00:50:51.115]  We're out of time Paul.
[00:50:51.155 --> 00:50:51.715]  Thanks for joining us.
[00:50:51.735 --> 00:50:52.416]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:01.223 --> 00:51:02.744]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:51:03.024 --> 00:51:18.532]  The earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear disaster that killed thousands of Japanese citizens is nothing compared to the devastation that could be caused by hyperinflation that will soon hit the United States and could lead to millions of Americans becoming homeless, all caused by the devalued U.S.
[00:51:18.572 --> 00:51:18.872]  dollar.
[00:51:18.912 --> 00:51:25.696]  While the mainstream media continues to ignore inflation, our friends at the National Inflation Association provide a free weekly newsletter
[00:51:25.816 --> 00:51:26.076]  We're good.

[00:53:11.445 --> 00:53:20.167]  Dermatol is made in America by Americans who know there's a more affordable, natural way to treat cuts, burns, bites, rashes, shingles, spoils, and many other skin problems.

[00:53:46.011 --> 00:53:46.371]  Economical.
[00:53:46.391 --> 00:53:46.611]  Effective.
[00:53:46.731 --> 00:53:47.532]  Spray it all with Dermatol!
[00:54:06.815 --> 00:54:15.222]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:54:24.437 --> 00:54:32.680]  We are discussing, well we just heard a speech by Ron Paul where he talked about the final nail in the coffin of the Republic.
[00:54:33.341 --> 00:54:35.822]  Paul Joseph Watson remains on the phone with us.
[00:54:35.882 --> 00:54:43.084]  He was giving us the details of that and now we're going to talk with Paul about TSA tyranny and the latest developments in that realm.
[00:54:43.124 --> 00:54:43.445]  Paul, what...
[00:54:44.705 --> 00:54:45.306]  What do you think?
[00:54:45.326 --> 00:54:58.340]  What do you think about what's going on in Texas these days with the TSA economic blockade threat, the protests on Wednesday led by Alex Jones, and now the TSA claiming it essentially has unlimited power under the U.S.
[00:54:58.380 --> 00:54:59.861]  Constitution to do whatever it wants?
[00:55:01.643 --> 00:55:03.045]  Well, it's amazing, Mike, because
[00:55:05.117 --> 00:55:18.509]  That act of financial terrorism in Texas, the federal blockade, the threat to impose a no-fly zone over Texas, you know, if the TSA broke down, we declared a felony.
[00:55:19.450 --> 00:55:21.952]  The bill passed the House unanimously, 138-0.
[00:55:21.972 --> 00:55:25.155]  It was set to pass the Senate.
[00:55:25.655 --> 00:55:31.160]  And then you had this corrupt establishment insider, David Dewhurst,
[00:55:31.878 --> 00:55:32.699]  All right.
[00:55:50.962 --> 00:55:51.303]  We're good.
[00:56:05.401 --> 00:56:10.686]  Well, I hope other states are taking note of this because, of course, Texans are very angry about this.
[00:56:11.206 --> 00:56:12.207]  I'm in Austin right now.
[00:56:12.247 --> 00:56:14.549]  I've been talking to some people around here over the past few days.
[00:56:14.609 --> 00:56:15.950]  People are extremely angry.
[00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:17.332]  There's going to be a backlash.
[00:56:17.812 --> 00:56:20.274]  And other states need to pay attention, too, because
[00:56:21.115 --> 00:56:32.258]  Now, your state could be threatened by the TSA with an economic blockade of all air traffic in and out of your state if you don't comply or if you threaten to take away some of the TSA's power.
[00:56:33.579 --> 00:56:40.521]  Paul, you have done an amazing job of covering this story and understanding the dynamics of the politics and the shifts of power.
[00:56:40.941 --> 00:56:44.822]  What are your predictions, if you're willing to offer one, here on live radio?
[00:56:45.183 --> 00:56:46.463]  Where do you think this is headed?
[00:56:48.484 --> 00:56:52.026]  I think it's headed to the abolition of the TSA.
[00:56:52.646 --> 00:56:58.969]  You've got the United States Travel Freedom Caucus headed up by State Rep.
[00:56:59.029 --> 00:57:03.211]  Sharon Cisner, who's from Alaska, who herself was groped by the TSA.
[00:57:03.251 --> 00:57:04.992]  This was a cancer survivor.
[00:57:05.412 --> 00:57:11.875]  Somebody was molested in her youth, and she came out right and said that the TSA is molesting people.
[00:57:12.315 --> 00:57:16.817]  She's got this caucus of lawmakers from nine states
[00:57:17.557 --> 00:57:25.683]  Who have already introduced or are in the process of crafting legislation identical to that in Texas, which should have passed.
[00:57:26.663 --> 00:57:34.689]  They plan to get 32 states on board with this bipartisan caucus to pass these bills in each individual state.
[00:57:35.309 --> 00:57:44.296]  So the federal government will have to economically, financially, you know, they'll have to issue these terrorist threats, these federal blockades to
[00:57:45.146 --> 00:57:46.528]  I hope you are right.
[00:58:04.471 --> 00:58:05.632]  I'm sorry, Paul, I didn't mean to interrupt you.
[00:58:05.652 --> 00:58:07.233]  We're about out of time here.
[00:58:07.713 --> 00:58:10.375]  I hope you're right about that, and I think you are.
[00:58:10.575 --> 00:58:13.937]  You have a very, very good analysis of what's going on.
[00:58:14.297 --> 00:58:20.581]  I really want to thank you for your time and joining us for this segment about the War Powers Shift and the TSA.
[00:58:20.621 --> 00:58:22.201]  Thanks for being with us today, Paul.
[00:58:22.282 --> 00:58:23.682]  It's always a great pleasure to talk with you.
[00:58:24.723 --> 00:58:25.243]  Thanks, Mike.
[00:58:25.283 --> 00:58:25.964]  Great to be with you.
[00:58:26.464 --> 00:58:29.046]  On the other side of this, folks, stay with us on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:58:29.066 --> 00:58:33.008]  We're going to be talking about GMOs when we come back at the top of the hour.
[00:58:44.964 --> 00:58:48.827]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:51.188 --> 00:58:52.309]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:58:52.349 --> 00:58:59.034]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:58:59.294 --> 00:59:01.576]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:59:01.836 --> 00:59:07.039]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:59:07.219 --> 00:59:10.001]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:59:10.261 --> 00:59:12.323]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:59:12.563 --> 00:59:18.508]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:59:18.828 --> 00:59:22.011]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:59:22.191 --> 00:59:29.297]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[00:59:29.617 --> 00:59:30.858]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:59:30.918 --> 00:59:33.480]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:37.644]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:59:37.824 --> 00:59:39.845]  You can find the video at www.
[00:59:40.606 --> 00:59:42.307]  End of America 3 dot com.
[00:59:42.427 --> 00:59:44.888]  That's End of America, the number 3 dot com.

[00:59:54.111 --> 00:59:56.032]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.492 --> 00:59:59.273]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.868 --> 01:00:10.052]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.693 --> 01:00:11.514]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.295 --> 01:00:13.215]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.836 --> 01:00:17.480]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:22.105]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.954 --> 01:00:27.538]  To the Alex Jones Show, my name is Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[01:00:27.558 --> 01:00:29.300]  I'm filling in for Alex today.
[01:00:30.261 --> 01:00:32.543]  Alex has had a pretty intense week.
[01:00:33.704 --> 01:00:34.525]  That's an understatement.
[01:00:35.006 --> 01:00:43.454]  He led a protest on Wednesday to protest the TSA's threat of an economic blockade against the airports in the state of Texas.
[01:00:44.375 --> 01:00:50.979]  And his voice was pretty hoarse yesterday, but he, you know, the guy's got an amazing voice, so he powered through the show no problem.
[01:00:51.459 --> 01:00:52.620]  Today I'm filling in for him.
[01:00:52.660 --> 01:01:00.065]  We just heard from Paul Joseph Watson, who helped us understand what's going on in Congress with a shift of power from Congress to the President.
[01:01:00.525 --> 01:01:11.031]  Ron Paul calls it the final nail in the coffin of the Republic if this new shift in war powers is granted to the executive branch of the U.S.
[01:01:11.071 --> 01:01:11.411]  government.
[01:01:12.592 --> 01:01:17.039]  I promised you we would talk about GMOs today, and we're going to do that right now.
[01:01:17.319 --> 01:01:21.525]  But first, just real quickly, there's a study you need to know about.
[01:01:22.026 --> 01:01:26.873]  This is a study that was published in the Public Library of Science, the open source medical journal.
[01:01:27.734 --> 01:01:43.718]  And it was conducted at Harvard Medical School, and it found that there is a quote, highly influential hidden curriculum that pushes doctors into training, that I'm sorry, that pushes doctors into accepting and promoting Big Pharma's products.
[01:01:44.778 --> 01:01:55.901]  In other words, doctors are indoctrinated in medical school to prescribe drugs, to push vaccines, to push a pharmaceutical approach rather than a holistic disease prevention approach.
[01:01:56.581 --> 01:02:00.502]  They're not familiar with nutrition by the time they graduate from medical school.
[01:02:00.522 --> 01:02:01.862]  You know, it's true.
[01:02:02.222 --> 01:02:02.962]  I know doctors.
[01:02:03.362 --> 01:02:04.003]  I talk to them.
[01:02:04.063 --> 01:02:04.663]  I interview them.
[01:02:05.143 --> 01:02:14.105]  And they'll tell you, as they've told me, that in four years of medical school, a typical doctor gets less than one hour of information on nutrition.
[01:02:14.305 --> 01:02:14.785]  One hour.
[01:02:14.985 --> 01:02:16.585]  We're talking 60 minutes.
[01:02:17.245 --> 01:02:17.585]  That's it.
[01:02:18.045 --> 01:02:20.706]  That's about all the nutrition information they get.
[01:02:21.406 --> 01:02:26.451]  Yeah, if you're watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, we have this up on the website.
[01:02:26.812 --> 01:02:32.998]  Harvard Medical School professors are paid big bucks by Big Pharma to push meds because they don't understand nutrition.
[01:02:33.018 --> 01:02:36.301]  They're only taught about pharmaceuticals, so that's what they push.
[01:02:36.341 --> 01:02:40.165]  Kind of sad, actually, because we could... You really want to control health care costs in America?
[01:02:40.505 --> 01:02:42.067]  Get nutrition legalized.
[01:02:42.547 --> 01:02:43.548]  Legalize health freedom.
[01:02:44.269 --> 01:02:48.012]  So that people can have access to the solutions to cancer.
[01:02:48.052 --> 01:02:50.274]  We know how to prevent cancer easily.
[01:02:50.454 --> 01:02:56.839]  We also know how to cure cancer in many cases using non-conventional, non-chemical treatments.
[01:02:57.259 --> 01:02:57.760]  I mean, it's funny.
[01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:07.708]  You look at Fukushima fallout, and we talked about Chernobyl fallout from 1986, and they said how many hundreds of thousands of people are going to get cancer from that.
[01:03:08.128 --> 01:03:10.070]  One of the doctors said, well, 470,000 people, their cancers will be treatable.
[01:03:13.092 --> 01:03:16.714]  Well, if you get cancer from radiation, what do they treat your cancer with?
[01:03:17.515 --> 01:03:18.395]  More radiation!
[01:03:19.616 --> 01:03:20.276]  It's insane!
[01:03:20.336 --> 01:03:35.164]  In fact, the amount of radiation you get in radiotherapy is orders of magnitude larger than the amount of radiation that you're exposed to even as a TEPCO worker inside the Fukushima nuclear power facility right now.
[01:03:35.204 --> 01:03:38.526]  That's how much radiation you get in radiotherapy.
[01:03:38.546 --> 01:03:39.447]  I didn't mean to get off track.
[01:03:40.666 --> 01:03:43.707]  But the cancer treatment industry is all about radiation.
[01:03:43.947 --> 01:03:47.308]  Come on, if radiation gave you cancer, how can it cure your cancer?
[01:03:47.388 --> 01:03:47.849]  It can't!
[01:03:48.789 --> 01:03:50.450]  Toxic chemicals can't cure your cancer.
[01:03:50.710 --> 01:03:57.352]  But getting on to GMOs, just a shocking new study came out, published in the journal Reproductive Toxicology.
[01:03:58.212 --> 01:04:01.174]  And this study is just blowing people's minds.
[01:04:01.614 --> 01:04:07.056]  It says 93% of unborn babies are contaminated with GMO toxins.
[01:04:08.617 --> 01:04:11.779]  Before you're even born, you're already contaminated with GMOs.
[01:04:11.839 --> 01:04:12.720]  That's what's happening.
[01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:12.720]  93%.
[01:04:14.261 --> 01:04:21.147]  We have other information here about the BT insecticide, which is generated by genetically modified crops.
[01:04:21.187 --> 01:04:27.412]  They actually grow their own insecticides in their plant fibers to fend off insects.
[01:04:27.452 --> 01:04:30.254]  So they're growing their own insecticides because they're GMOs.
[01:04:30.574 --> 01:04:34.577]  Well, these BT insecticides are now being found in human blood.
[01:04:35.638 --> 01:04:39.923]  We will discuss more of this as we continue here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:04:40.304 --> 01:04:45.350]  On the other side of this break, we have a couple of important news items, but more on GMOs when we return.
[01:04:45.470 --> 01:04:45.991]  Stay with us.
[01:05:02.250 --> 01:05:03.752]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:03.972 --> 01:05:08.997]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:05:09.277 --> 01:05:10.638]  Saving means to make money.
[01:05:10.819 --> 01:05:19.607]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:05:20.328 --> 01:05:27.432]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:05:27.872 --> 01:05:35.476]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:05:35.876 --> 01:05:40.798]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[01:06:01.687 --> 01:06:16.157]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:06:17.157 --> 01:06:20.820]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:21.843 --> 01:06:33.855]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:06:34.595 --> 01:06:41.882]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:06:42.563 --> 01:06:52.154]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[01:06:52.935 --> 01:06:56.198]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[01:06:56.859 --> 01:06:59.982]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:07:00.603 --> 01:07:04.824]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:07:05.144 --> 01:07:05.744]  Number 1.
[01:07:06.064 --> 01:07:09.205]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:09.485 --> 01:07:10.045]  Number 2.
[01:07:10.345 --> 01:07:14.887]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:07:15.227 --> 01:07:15.687]  It's true.
[01:07:15.967 --> 01:07:20.528]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:07:20.848 --> 01:07:21.388]  Number 3.
[01:07:21.668 --> 01:07:24.949]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:07:25.249 --> 01:07:28.950]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:07:29.170 --> 01:07:29.711]  Number 4.
[01:07:29.951 --> 01:07:32.333]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:07:32.713 --> 01:07:36.096]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:07:36.396 --> 01:07:36.937]  Number 5.
[01:07:37.197 --> 01:07:41.120]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:07:41.341 --> 01:07:46.105]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:07:46.385 --> 01:07:50.407]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:50.547 --> 01:07:52.108]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:52.348 --> 01:07:54.430]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:07:54.590 --> 01:07:57.191]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:07:57.211 --> 01:08:03.935]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:04.475 --> 01:08:07.277]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:10.265 --> 01:08:12.126]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:12.146 --> 01:08:13.307]  I'm filling in for Alex today.
[01:08:13.327 --> 01:08:15.688]  My name is Mike Adams, the Health Ranger.
[01:08:16.088 --> 01:08:30.096]  We have been talking about some health issues and we're going to continue to cover GMOs because of this breaking research that shows, and I have a small correction here, I said 93% of unborn babies are contaminated with GMO toxins.
[01:08:30.137 --> 01:08:30.717]  That's actually 80%.
[01:08:30.797 --> 01:08:32.398]  The 93% is the pregnant women.
[01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:46.806]  93% of expectant mothers are contaminated with GMOs because of what they're eating and we will talk about where all these GMO toxins are coming from in your food.
[01:08:47.366 --> 01:08:50.508]  But before we get to that, we have some additional breaking news.
[01:08:50.568 --> 01:08:57.132]  Now you may recall the coverage of this right here on Alex Jones Show and PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:08:58.072 --> 01:08:59.093]  About a U.S.
[01:08:59.113 --> 01:09:01.154]  Marine Corps veteran, Jose.
[01:09:01.434 --> 01:09:03.575]  Jose Morena.
[01:09:03.595 --> 01:09:07.477]  He was killed by what I understand was a SWAT raid.
[01:09:07.497 --> 01:09:08.737]  He was shot 60 times.
[01:09:08.938 --> 01:09:12.860]  He is a veteran who was killed by a police raid.
[01:09:13.940 --> 01:09:27.811]  In Tucson, Arizona, there's going to be a memorial for him, a gathering, on Monday morning, and joining us here to talk about this, and we'll give you more details, so stay tuned here, is Stuart Rhodes, founder of OathKeepers.org.
[01:09:28.112 --> 01:09:29.072]  Stuart, are you with us?
[01:09:30.133 --> 01:09:31.775]  Yes, I am.
[01:09:31.795 --> 01:09:33.816]  Thank you for taking time, sir, to join us today.
[01:09:33.876 --> 01:09:40.422]  Can you tell us a little bit about this rally, what's going on, and what's the story behind this?
[01:09:41.857 --> 01:09:47.684]  Well, what this is, as you said, this was a shooting of a Marine veteran, and this is a critical point.
[01:09:48.265 --> 01:09:52.771]  This is only for a search warrant, and this is a person who had no criminal history.
[01:09:53.453 --> 01:10:02.202]  And that's a major problem right there, is that SWAT is now being used to serve routine search warrants and on people with no criminal history of violent crime.
[01:10:02.822 --> 01:10:09.388]  And so the only real justification for going in like this is that he is a person who may have weapons.
[01:10:09.409 --> 01:10:11.110]  Well, that's half the country at least.
[01:10:11.911 --> 01:10:13.492]  And so that's the first problem with it.
[01:10:14.033 --> 01:10:16.876]  And the second problem with it is that SWAT raids like this
[01:10:17.689 --> 01:10:18.350]  I don't think so.
[01:10:38.635 --> 01:10:42.859]  Was this raid conducted by Tucson PD or Tucson SWAT?
[01:10:42.899 --> 01:10:44.120]  No, not Tucson PD.
[01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:47.643]  It was the Pima County regional SWAT team.
[01:10:47.864 --> 01:10:48.304]  I see.
[01:10:48.364 --> 01:10:50.826]  It was by Pima County sheriffs.
[01:10:50.987 --> 01:10:56.752]  This is Sheriff Defnick's department, but also officers from other jurisdictions combined.
[01:10:57.355 --> 01:11:01.097]  What is happening now in the aftermath of the investigation of this?
[01:11:01.417 --> 01:11:07.840]  Obviously your rally is going to be very important and I hope you have people out there with video cameras so you can get some footage of this and share it with us.
[01:11:08.860 --> 01:11:14.143]  Not only on the Alex Jones Show but also with the website where I'm an editor as well.
[01:11:17.264 --> 01:11:20.246]  What is the aftermath of this situation in the investigation?
[01:11:21.971 --> 01:11:23.792]  Well, what do you mean they answered that?
[01:11:41.472 --> 01:11:47.978]  Well, like I said, I think the fact that they went in so quickly, and there's a video right now from a helmet cam of one of the officers.
[01:11:48.839 --> 01:12:00.749]  Initially, there were conflicting stories about whether or not they had the sirens on, and you had a Vietnam that our neighbor said he didn't hear any sirens, and we also had our Chief of President go down there and talk to neighbors, and they said they didn't hear any sirens.
[01:12:01.109 --> 01:12:03.431]  And it's possible that they played the siren, but no one heard it.
[01:12:04.332 --> 01:12:04.792]  I don't know.
[01:12:19.628 --> 01:12:19.768]  Yes.
[01:12:19.888 --> 01:12:19.988]  Yes.
[01:12:38.860 --> 01:12:40.200]  I can pull the curtains back and do that.
[01:12:40.221 --> 01:12:44.642]  Anybody who's got any training is not going to do that, expose themselves to possible hostile fire.
[01:12:45.022 --> 01:12:48.003]  And Tucson's got a real problem with home invasions.
[01:12:48.043 --> 01:12:57.046]  Even the police themselves acknowledged that Tucson's well known for home invasions, which is why they play the siren to let people know that it's police and not a home invasion.
[01:12:57.666 --> 01:13:05.554]  Well, the problem is that they might not hear the siren or they might not realize the siren has anything to do with this big bang on their door.
[01:13:05.594 --> 01:13:07.736]  So that's a systemic problem across the country.
[01:13:07.756 --> 01:13:08.957]  That's why we're going to be there.
[01:13:09.278 --> 01:13:14.963]  Slots should be used for routine search warrants on people with no violent criminal history.
[01:13:14.983 --> 01:13:15.944]  There's no justification.
[01:13:16.785 --> 01:13:26.631]  We're getting a lot of background noise from you there Stuart so let me let me just break in here and it sounds like you're in an airport so I appreciate you taking time out of your busy schedule but the the event is at 8 a.m.
[01:13:26.691 --> 01:13:40.440]  sharp Monday morning that's Memorial Day May 30th and it is in Tucson and by the way I used to live in Pima County so I can confirm that there are a lot of home invasions a lot of break-ins there that's a big issue down there and how do you know
[01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:43.666]  Whether it's a criminal breaking in versus a SWAT team.
[01:13:44.127 --> 01:13:45.529]  Especially if you don't expect a SWAT team.
[01:13:45.629 --> 01:13:48.455]  If you're not a criminal, why would you expect a SWAT team to break down your door?
[01:13:49.136 --> 01:13:51.360]  So you would assume that they must be criminals if they're breaking in.
[01:13:52.202 --> 01:13:53.103]  Reasonably assume that.
[01:13:53.891 --> 01:13:59.715]  And in fact, the more well-trained you are, the more likely you are to react like this Marine, which is kind of a perverse, perverse situation.
[01:13:59.755 --> 01:14:12.224]  So retired police officers, veterans, any well-trained civilian, the better trained they are, the more likely they are to do the exact same thing you did, and the more likely you are to be shot by SWAT, because they're not going to wait to see whether you're a good guy with a gun or a bad guy with a gun.
[01:14:12.564 --> 01:14:14.285]  They assume everyone with a gun is a bad guy.
[01:14:14.486 --> 01:14:14.846]  That's right.
[01:14:16.417 --> 01:14:20.980]  Alright, the location is at the intersection of West Valencia Road and South Wade Road.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:25.303]  Is there a website where people can get information?
[01:14:46.357 --> 01:14:47.257]  That's a very dangerous thing to do.
[01:14:47.958 --> 01:14:48.978]  Alright, thank you.
[01:14:49.538 --> 01:14:53.420]  Oathkeepers.org, everybody, to get more information about this Memorial Day meeting.
[01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:56.121]  And Mrs. Vanessa Huerena is going to be there.
[01:14:56.161 --> 01:15:04.004]  She is the spouse, the widow of the Marine Corps veteran who was shot and killed in this raid.
[01:15:04.044 --> 01:15:05.024]  Stuart, thank you for joining us.
[01:15:05.044 --> 01:15:09.026]  We really appreciate your time and your efforts to bring this subject to light.
[01:15:11.274 --> 01:15:11.634]  Thank you.
[01:15:12.355 --> 01:15:14.858]  This is just some of what's going on in America these days, folks.
[01:15:14.878 --> 01:15:16.339]  You've got raids.
[01:15:16.379 --> 01:15:19.983]  We covered a raid of a woman in Detroit, Marianne Godboldo.
[01:15:20.403 --> 01:15:30.113]  She refused to medicate her child with psychiatric drugs, her teenage daughter, and the police showed up, knocked on her door, demanded to come in and kidnap her daughter.
[01:15:30.793 --> 01:15:31.674]  She refused.
[01:15:32.655 --> 01:15:35.616]  Allegedly a shot was fired and then the SWAT team showed up.
[01:15:36.037 --> 01:15:42.960]  So, she has a SWAT team on her front porch and the state eventually did take her daughter away and now she's facing multiple criminal charges.
[01:15:43.420 --> 01:15:44.561]  That happened in Detroit.
[01:15:44.821 --> 01:15:47.042]  This is happening increasingly across America.
[01:15:47.762 --> 01:15:50.464]  The guns are coming out, and without justification.
[01:15:50.504 --> 01:15:59.652]  I mean, I don't mind using the threat of lethal force against real criminals, against serial rapists, against murderers, you know, against people who are a real danger to society.
[01:15:59.672 --> 01:16:03.515]  We obviously need a local police system, like sheriffs.
[01:16:03.915 --> 01:16:05.377]  We need some law and order.
[01:16:05.397 --> 01:16:08.960]  We are supposed to be a country of law and order, so I don't have anything against that.
[01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:25.089]  But when these guns and this force is turned against innocent citizens, and especially Iraq war veterans, who have served our nation, and who have put their bodies and their lives on the line in defense of America, for them to be gunned down?
[01:16:25.249 --> 01:16:26.550]  It's just incredible.
[01:16:29.112 --> 01:16:30.993]  It's hard to get back to GMOs.
[01:16:32.313 --> 01:16:33.134]  But I gotta cover that.
[01:16:33.154 --> 01:16:37.598]  It's very frustrating, obviously, to see what's happening in America today.
[01:16:37.638 --> 01:16:46.205]  But look, the GMO issue is just as important because this is a widespread contamination of our entire food supply.
[01:16:46.505 --> 01:16:52.010]  Now we're seeing the BT toxin in the blood of fetuses, in the blood of expectant mothers.
[01:16:52.691 --> 01:16:55.773]  And this is even from people who think they're not eating GMOs.
[01:16:56.274 --> 01:16:57.134]  How are you getting it?
[01:16:57.575 --> 01:16:58.435]  Here's how it works.
[01:16:59.136 --> 01:17:06.585]  If you're out there buying, let's say, beef or pork or chicken, you might think, hey, the cow isn't genetically modified, the chicken's not genetically modified.
[01:17:06.806 --> 01:17:08.007]  Well, not yet, anyway.
[01:17:08.488 --> 01:17:10.630]  If you give it a few more years, they probably will be, too.
[01:17:11.431 --> 01:17:13.954]  But the cows are being fed GMO corn.
[01:17:14.575 --> 01:17:16.938]  The chickens are fed GMO corn and soy.
[01:17:17.759 --> 01:17:32.366]  and and the pork they're being fed the pigs are being fed GMOs so the GMOs are being concentrated in the bodies of these animals so that when you buy the beef or you buy the chicken or you buy the pork and you eat that you are eating a concentrated source
[01:17:33.466 --> 01:17:34.527]  We're good to go.
[01:17:51.819 --> 01:17:52.940]  It doesn't have to be organic.
[01:17:52.980 --> 01:17:55.201]  If it's just free-range, grass-fed, local beef, go.
[01:17:55.741 --> 01:18:03.225]  I implore you, go down to your farmer's market on this Saturday, tomorrow, and find a source for some local grass-fed beef.
[01:18:03.345 --> 01:18:05.806]  If you eat beef, get it where it's safe.
[01:18:06.386 --> 01:18:16.511]  Don't get beef that comes out of a factory, an animal food factory, where they're fattened up with GMO corn because they're just concentrating the poisons from the GMOs.
[01:18:16.832 --> 01:18:18.933]  Now the GMOs, look at this.
[01:18:19.733 --> 01:18:24.716]  They are now poisons in the bodies of a whole generation of children, virtually.
[01:18:25.357 --> 01:18:29.600]  We're getting close to 100% contamination of North Americans with GMOs.
[01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:31.581]  That's how bad it has become.
[01:18:32.121 --> 01:18:36.904]  And it's not just about poisoning us with GMOs, it's also about controlling the food supply.
[01:18:37.445 --> 01:18:47.972]  Because the farmers are being told that if you don't buy the GMO seeds, then when the GMOs contaminate your fields, you're going to be sued by the GM seed companies.
[01:18:48.652 --> 01:18:56.878]  So they're being economically terrorized, much in the same way that the TSA is terrorizing the state of Texas economically by threatening to shut down the airports.
[01:18:57.819 --> 01:19:03.543]  The GMO seed companies do much of the same thing to the farmers, so the farmers give in far too often.
[01:19:04.554 --> 01:19:10.017]  They believe the lies, they believe that the GMOs will produce more crops, and then they have a crop failure.
[01:19:10.417 --> 01:19:23.823]  In India today, I don't know how many suicides, it's something like 30,000 suicides a year from farmers who were growing GMO crops, and then they had crop failures, and it didn't produce what was promised.
[01:19:24.243 --> 01:19:26.485]  It's a big lie about the GMOs.
[01:19:26.925 --> 01:19:28.806]  They say that the GMOs are going to feed the world.
[01:19:28.886 --> 01:19:29.306]  No, they're not.
[01:19:29.646 --> 01:19:31.007]  They're going to poison the world!
[01:19:31.587 --> 01:19:41.460]  And we're seeing the evidence right now with the BT toxin in the blood of expectant mothers and in the fetuses, in the unborn babies who are born contaminated with GMOs.

[01:21:06.184 --> 01:21:06.704]  The U.S.
[01:21:06.764 --> 01:21:13.487]  government is a Ponzi scheme that relies on the Treasury continuously selling large amounts of government bonds to foreign central banks.
[01:21:14.027 --> 01:21:16.668]  With Japan about to become a seller of U.S.
[01:21:16.748 --> 01:21:19.990]  bonds in order to rebuild its own nation, and the U.S.
[01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:26.673]  antagonizing China by calling them currency manipulators, the Federal Reserve, which is already buying about 70% of U.S.
[01:21:26.733 --> 01:21:29.334]  Treasuries, will soon be the only buyer left of U.S.
[01:21:29.374 --> 01:21:29.814]  Treasuries.
[01:21:30.234 --> 01:21:33.697]  Our friends at the National Inflation Association believe that the U.S.
[01:21:33.757 --> 01:21:39.321]  dollar will soon become worthless and Americans will see the purchasing power of their incomes and savings destroyed.
[01:21:39.701 --> 01:21:47.687]  I strongly urge my fellow Americans to sign up for the free NIA newsletter at www.inflation.us.

[01:24:09.707 --> 01:24:11.907]  Welcome back folks to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:11.927 --> 01:24:14.448]  I'm Mike Adams, the health ranger filling in for Alex today.
[01:24:14.528 --> 01:24:17.309]  We've been talking about GMOs and a number of fascinating topics.
[01:24:18.509 --> 01:24:20.329]  Oh man, GMOs.
[01:24:20.489 --> 01:24:24.730]  I want to share something with you very quickly on this about GMO labeling.
[01:24:25.270 --> 01:24:32.232]  Because in America, the industry, the FDA, and the USDA have conspired with the food industry to make sure
[01:24:32.972 --> 01:24:36.374]  That you, the consumer, don't know what contains GMOs.
[01:24:36.715 --> 01:24:40.377]  They've said, if it's labeled, oh, it might confuse you.
[01:24:40.958 --> 01:24:41.438]  That's right.
[01:24:41.838 --> 01:24:44.420]  Having more information might be confusing to people.
[01:24:44.460 --> 01:24:46.401]  That's how stupid they think you are.
[01:24:47.302 --> 01:24:49.864]  What's wrong with a label that says this food contains GMOs?
[01:24:50.704 --> 01:24:55.608]  Well, the reason they don't do that is because they know if that label was on there, nobody would buy it.
[01:24:55.908 --> 01:24:57.769]  Well, most people wouldn't buy it anyway.
[01:24:58.410 --> 01:24:59.711]  People who are informed wouldn't buy it.
[01:25:01.315 --> 01:25:04.097]  And most of the food industry would collapse.
[01:25:04.137 --> 01:25:11.101]  I mean, look, even Whole Foods admits that their organic foods are not 100% free of GMOs.
[01:25:11.361 --> 01:25:14.122]  They admit that, and I'm a supporter of Whole Foods in many ways.
[01:25:14.183 --> 01:25:20.286]  I like to buy health products there, but even they can't control it because the cross-contamination is so great.
[01:25:20.586 --> 01:25:24.849]  So there's GMO contamination even in the stuff that you think doesn't have GMOs.
[01:25:25.309 --> 01:25:26.490]  But here's what I want to warn you about.
[01:25:27.290 --> 01:25:31.614]  When you're out buying corn chips, now corn is almost always GMO if it's not organic.
[01:25:32.295 --> 01:25:39.923]  So if you're buying corn chips and that bag of corn chips says, it's all natural, you might think, well, that must be natural.
[01:25:40.724 --> 01:25:43.847]  In other words, it can't be genetically engineered if it's natural, right?
[01:25:44.427 --> 01:25:45.569]  That's what they want you to believe.
[01:25:46.744 --> 01:25:51.225]  In truth, that contains GMOs as well, usually, unless it's organic.
[01:25:51.865 --> 01:25:55.386]  So organic cannot be grown intentionally with GMOs.
[01:25:55.426 --> 01:26:12.111]  So the way to get non-GMOs, if you're buying corn, corn chips, or corn flake type of cereal, or corn tortillas, or, you know, soy products, or canola oil, the only way to get it without GMOs is to make sure that it's USDA organic.
[01:26:13.177 --> 01:26:17.983]  And then you can trust it to have virtually no GMOs, even though there's probably still a little bit of contamination.
[01:26:18.364 --> 01:26:20.707]  But again, if it just says natural, forget it!
[01:26:21.247 --> 01:26:22.108]  It's got GMOs in it.
[01:26:22.509 --> 01:26:23.170]  Almost always.
[01:26:24.231 --> 01:26:26.915]  That's the truth about GMO labeling, that they don't want you to know.
[01:26:28.137 --> 01:26:32.943]  And I'd love to talk to you more about GMOs, but I got to share this with you about the FTC.
[01:26:32.963 --> 01:26:36.828]  The FTC, because this is a short segment here, jeez, we need to get moving.
[01:26:37.468 --> 01:26:42.895]  The FTC is conducting a secret war on nutritional and health product companies.
[01:26:43.235 --> 01:26:46.780]  They conducted a raid not too long ago on Daniel Chapter 1.
[01:26:48.001 --> 01:26:49.001]  A gunpoint raid.
[01:26:49.662 --> 01:26:55.744]  They, they, oh man, there was a three-year-old granddaughter in the office who hid behind a bookcase as the raid happened.
[01:26:55.764 --> 01:26:58.105]  They came in shouting, it's a raid, it's a raid!
[01:26:58.245 --> 01:26:59.865]  Armed agents with bulletproof vests.
[01:27:00.205 --> 01:27:01.386]  And what does this company sell?
[01:27:01.606 --> 01:27:03.646]  What did they sell that's so dangerous?
[01:27:04.667 --> 01:27:10.429]  They sell herbs that have an anti-cancer natural chemical in the herbs.
[01:27:11.772 --> 01:27:12.172]  That's right!
[01:27:12.292 --> 01:27:28.896]  One of the things that the search warrant was looking for that was used by the federal government to conduct this raid was, quote, "...any representation that any Daniel Chapter 1 product can be used to prevent, treat, cure, or mitigate any illness in man or other animal."
[01:27:29.776 --> 01:27:30.136]  Yeah.
[01:27:30.956 --> 01:27:32.516]  So first of all, they think we're all animals.
[01:27:33.717 --> 01:27:39.398]  And secondly, they think that anything that can treat or cure a disease is illegal contraband.
[01:27:41.099 --> 01:27:44.621]  Is there any wonder why we have a healthcare crisis in America?
[01:27:44.661 --> 01:27:49.385]  Why we have just skyrocketing rates of chronic degenerative disease that we know how to cure?
[01:27:49.405 --> 01:27:53.968]  Is there any reason the states and the government's going broke because of healthcare costs?
[01:27:54.488 --> 01:28:04.654]  Because the government comes in and says, if your medicine works, if this herb works or this vitamin works or this supplement works, then it's illegal!
[01:28:05.535 --> 01:28:07.677]  Because they say then it's an unapproved drug.
[01:28:08.197 --> 01:28:09.439]  That's right, it's an unapproved drug.
[01:28:09.719 --> 01:28:22.750]  Then they go in, they stole, with Daniel Chapter 1, by the way, they stole their computers, they stole their personal files, they stole their list of testimonials and even their witness list that they were going to use to help defend themselves in the FTC court.
[01:28:23.691 --> 01:28:30.937]  You can learn more about this, by the way, at DanielChapter1Freedom.com I don't know if you can bring up that website, but DanielChapter1Freedom.com
[01:28:33.667 --> 01:28:39.369]  They are one of the companies that's being pursued by the FTC in this tyranny situation.
[01:28:39.409 --> 01:28:48.811]  Another one, see if you can bring this up, the consent decree of permanent injunction that the FTC filed against the company that manufactures Cherry products.
[01:28:49.331 --> 01:28:50.051]  This is incredible.
[01:28:50.571 --> 01:28:58.813]  You don't even know about this because most companies will not publicly talk about this because they're so intimidated and so afraid of the tyrants at the FTC.
[01:28:59.693 --> 01:29:01.014]  That they won't talk about this publicly.
[01:29:01.054 --> 01:29:05.218]  I've had dozens of these companies talk to me privately, but not let me go public with this.
[01:29:05.578 --> 01:29:12.363]  A consent decree is what the FTC requires a company to sign in order to control them.
[01:29:12.383 --> 01:29:17.467]  And when you sign a consent decree, you admit to committing crimes that you never committed.
[01:29:18.068 --> 01:29:28.937]  You admit to introducing into commerce articles of misbranded drugs, even though all you were selling was a cherry extract, or a blueberry extract, or an anti-cancer herb.
[01:29:29.457 --> 01:29:30.998]  This is happening in America today, folks.
[01:29:31.578 --> 01:29:34.079]  We're going to talk more about this every opportunity we get.
[01:29:34.119 --> 01:29:35.639]  Stay with us here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:29:35.679 --> 01:29:37.720]  There's more on the other side of this break.
[01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:38.240]  Thank you.
[01:29:51.345 --> 01:29:52.245]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.745 --> 01:29:54.346]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.266 --> 01:29:57.947]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.107 --> 01:30:04.608]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[01:30:04.929 --> 01:30:08.990]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[01:30:09.210 --> 01:30:14.252]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[01:30:14.352 --> 01:30:19.114]  Not looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[01:30:19.855 --> 01:30:27.018]  Not worried about them moving south, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[01:30:29.631 --> 01:30:34.034]  I'm looking for America.
[01:30:35.175 --> 01:30:36.596]  Wear American and be proud.
[01:30:36.816 --> 01:30:38.917]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[01:30:38.957 --> 01:30:43.601]  Land of the free and the home of the brave.
[01:30:44.041 --> 01:30:47.824]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[01:30:55.606 --> 01:31:00.229]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[01:31:00.889 --> 01:31:03.670]  It could never happen in America, but it's happening right now.
[01:31:03.871 --> 01:31:07.212]  Gas prices are exploding past the incomes of millions of families.
[01:31:07.492 --> 01:31:13.876]  As gas prices and crop failures push high food costs, you can still get the best food on the planet from eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:31:14.116 --> 01:31:19.279]  Demand for food is high, but eFoodsDirect has plenty of radiation-free food to meet your needs.

[01:31:49.888 --> 01:31:53.831]  That's 800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:32:04.924 --> 01:32:05.845]  Tyranny is here.
[01:32:06.185 --> 01:32:09.747]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:32:10.047 --> 01:32:12.329]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:32:12.349 --> 01:32:17.772]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:32:18.212 --> 01:32:24.456]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:32:24.876 --> 01:32:30.440]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:32:30.860 --> 01:32:34.543]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:32:35.043 --> 01:32:39.026]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:32:39.326 --> 01:32:44.870]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:32:45.270 --> 01:32:48.253]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:32:48.833 --> 01:32:50.254]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:32:50.794 --> 01:32:51.235]  It's here.

[01:33:09.758 --> 01:33:11.999]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:12.019 --> 01:33:13.200]  I hope you're enjoying today's show.
[01:33:13.220 --> 01:33:18.162]  We've been talking about GMOs and health freedom, TSA, a number of other topics.
[01:33:18.743 --> 01:33:23.946]  We have Aaron Dykes going to be joining us here to talk more about the TSA in just a minute.
[01:33:23.966 --> 01:33:35.492]  I'm going to wrap up the health freedom issue with the FDA and the consent decree first because what I left off with before the break was the idea that the FDA could come in and make you sign a secret document
[01:33:36.226 --> 01:33:39.969]  Call the consent decree that forces you to admit to crimes you didn't commit.
[01:33:40.450 --> 01:33:44.873]  And in that document, I just want to share a couple more details with you, and I have this document in front of me here.
[01:33:44.893 --> 01:33:55.482]  I don't know if you can get an overhead shot of this, but it says that at any time, the FDA can force you to cease manufacturing, to submit reports to the FDA,
[01:33:56.303 --> 01:34:07.917]  To recall any of your products, to take whatever corrective actions it wants you to take, and then the FDA can conduct surprise inspections of your facility and they'll bill you for it.
[01:34:08.197 --> 01:34:08.357]  Yep.
[01:34:08.718 --> 01:34:15.045]  You gotta pay the FDA something like, what is it, $78 an hour plus mileage to come raid you without notice.
[01:34:15.766 --> 01:34:17.027]  That's how crazy this gets.
[01:34:17.167 --> 01:34:27.292]  Plus, you're supposed to turn over your entire customer list to the FDA, and the FDA has forced some companies to refund everybody who has ever bought their product in the history of the company.
[01:34:27.672 --> 01:34:28.933]  They don't do that with drug companies.
[01:34:29.293 --> 01:34:34.896]  When drug companies are caught lying and fabricating studies, they don't have to refund everybody who ever bought the product.
[01:34:35.156 --> 01:34:39.719]  This is a tactic reserved solely for the nutritional supplements industry.
[01:34:40.459 --> 01:34:48.667]  And then if you don't go along with the FDA, you're going to be fined $1,000 a day per incident for as long as you hold out.
[01:34:49.548 --> 01:34:51.130]  So that can mount up pretty quickly.
[01:34:51.170 --> 01:35:00.840]  Basically, this is a way to put companies out of business who are selling natural products that can prevent, and even in my opinion, in many cases, cure degenerative disease.
[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:03.402]  So I hope we get a chance to talk about this more.
[01:35:03.642 --> 01:35:07.005]  But now, in this segment, we're going to be joined by Aaron Dykes.
[01:35:07.345 --> 01:35:09.027]  Aaron, thanks for joining us, man.
[01:35:09.047 --> 01:35:10.288]  Yeah, it's great to be on with you.
[01:35:10.668 --> 01:35:11.629]  It's good to have you here.
[01:35:11.669 --> 01:35:15.032]  We don't get a chance to do this very often, so it's good for you to be here.
[01:35:15.172 --> 01:35:16.113]  Well, maybe more and more so.
[01:35:16.693 --> 01:35:17.033]  I hope so.
[01:35:35.858 --> 01:35:44.003]  They don't have to pay damages, etc., for the big military-industrial stuff, and it's linked in at that military-industrial level with the food and the drug stuff.
[01:35:44.063 --> 01:35:45.164]  It's just totally creepy.
[01:35:45.224 --> 01:35:58.333]  That's a really good point, because even, for example, chemotherapy came out of the chemical weapons of World War I. I mean, the parent chemicals of these drugs are the same as the bioweapons.
[01:35:59.513 --> 01:36:07.417]  That have been outlawed by... You've got Donald Rumsfeld and those kind of people working with Searle and the vaccine stuff and the aspartame.
[01:36:07.437 --> 01:36:07.797]  That's right.
[01:36:08.177 --> 01:36:10.018]  And I looked up Monsanto the other day.
[01:36:10.098 --> 01:36:10.899]  Totally creepy.
[01:36:10.919 --> 01:36:17.042]  Their corporate board tied in with Lockheed Martin, tied in with McDonald's, a lot of other really strange stuff.
[01:36:17.062 --> 01:36:19.303]  Skull and bones senators and... Yeah.
[01:36:19.523 --> 01:36:23.145]  Well, the weapons manufacturers, I mean, they've turned the food into a weapon.
[01:36:23.345 --> 01:36:24.185]  I mean, that's the key.
[01:36:24.285 --> 01:36:27.367]  That's where GMOs are at right now, where the food is the weapon.
[01:36:27.987 --> 01:36:28.448]  Absolutely.
[01:36:28.488 --> 01:36:31.190]  Because they can drop bombs on you, but that's kind of obvious.
[01:36:31.790 --> 01:36:38.175]  It's a little more covert to put fluoride in your water, and put aspartame in your diet soda, and put BT toxin in your corn.
[01:36:38.676 --> 01:36:39.617]  People don't notice that.
[01:36:40.222 --> 01:36:47.487]  And there's so many inputs, and they work together, it would be very hard to prove that they caused all this damage down the road, especially when it takes decades.
[01:36:47.988 --> 01:36:49.849]  But it certainly accumulates, right?
[01:36:50.009 --> 01:36:50.329]  That's right.
[01:36:50.950 --> 01:36:54.232]  Now, I understand you've got a lot of information about TSA for us today.
[01:36:54.272 --> 01:37:01.378]  Well, I'm just totally riled up about them this week, having been at the Capitol, and it's like one of those best of times, worst of times week.
[01:37:01.418 --> 01:37:02.839]  I've really seen the activists
[01:37:03.419 --> 01:37:09.065]  Just totally focused and mobilized and being effective, not only here in Texas, but all across the country.
[01:37:09.445 --> 01:37:11.007]  But then TSA is moving forward.
[01:37:11.027 --> 01:37:21.538]  They're getting more aggressive than ever, doing the stuff at the proms, just really doing the strong-arm tactic, financial terrorism, saying that it would be a no-fly zone, that the planes wouldn't be able to leave.
[01:37:21.558 --> 01:37:23.801]  I mean, that is just so bold.
[01:37:23.861 --> 01:37:24.661]  I cannot believe it.
[01:37:25.540 --> 01:37:34.102]  Well, I mean, this is what got Alex all riled up on Wednesday, where he spontaneously called for a rally at the state capitol here in Austin.
[01:37:34.762 --> 01:37:41.404]  And I understand a couple hundred people over a period of several hours came and joined it and then left on their own schedule.
[01:37:42.044 --> 01:37:44.444]  But that was quite an event going on down there.
[01:37:44.464 --> 01:37:47.685]  Yeah, I dare say they heard the message.
[01:37:48.585 --> 01:37:49.985]  But they killed the bill, of course.
[01:37:50.466 --> 01:37:51.346]  But now we have
[01:37:52.762 --> 01:37:53.242]  Excuse me.
[01:37:53.963 --> 01:37:55.244]  Now we have the Lieutenant Governor.
[01:37:55.304 --> 01:37:56.725]  He was about to run for Senate.
[01:37:57.165 --> 01:38:06.012]  Now, Dan Patrick, the guy who raised the legislation and was angry that it was killed, he announced today he is running for Senate, I guess presumably against Dewhurst.
[01:38:06.132 --> 01:38:07.033]  Oh, fantastic.
[01:38:07.053 --> 01:38:11.336]  So we will see what happens there, but could actually be a candidate worth supporting.
[01:38:11.916 --> 01:38:15.137]  Well, Patrick, I remember a quote from him in the aftermath of this.
[01:38:15.197 --> 01:38:19.799]  He stood up and said, you know, I remember a day when Texans used to stand up against government.
[01:38:20.479 --> 01:38:21.479]  He didn't use the word tyranny.
[01:38:21.499 --> 01:38:27.041]  I think he used intervention or just government interference with the lives of Texans.
[01:38:27.922 --> 01:38:36.725]  And, you know, he sounds like a guy who gets it, that he understands that freedom is crucial for abundance and for a nation to have success in the long term.
[01:38:37.489 --> 01:38:51.938]  Yeah, you know, I don't know his whole record, but there are a lot of liberty-loving people in the house, definitely some villains too, but I think we're going to win because every kind of bold-faced, strong-armed tactic really only makes their outrages that much more obvious.
[01:38:52.779 --> 01:39:05.727]  Do you get a sense that more and more Texans, because we're talking about this case, the TSA has almost targeted Texas now, are Texans increasingly outraged and willing to take action to stand up against this?
[01:39:06.895 --> 01:39:11.659]  I think they are, especially here in Central Texas, and I just hope we see more mobilization.
[01:39:11.699 --> 01:39:15.663]  How many other states is it that are passing or proposing similar legislation?
[01:39:15.703 --> 01:39:20.827]  I thought it was between 25 and 30 other states who are considering similar legislation.
[01:39:21.828 --> 01:39:27.092]  But I wonder, what's it going to take to get the TSA to stop molesting air travelers?
[01:39:27.132 --> 01:39:30.015]  I mean, do we have to march in with the local sheriff?
[01:39:31.007 --> 01:39:34.950]  I think that's a great idea, because it's just so fundamental.
[01:39:35.010 --> 01:39:36.671]  You don't mess with the Fourth Amendment.
[01:39:37.131 --> 01:39:42.835]  No search and seizure without probable cause, without specific things to be found, etc., etc.
[01:39:43.276 --> 01:39:45.697]  But they say they have pure supremacy.
[01:39:45.757 --> 01:39:47.198]  They say they'll do whatever they want.
[01:39:48.639 --> 01:39:51.982]  It boggles the mind, but those are the tactics they're using.
[01:39:52.402 --> 01:39:53.102]  It's martial law.
[01:39:53.303 --> 01:39:57.486]  Well, the other thing, Aaron, that really concerns me is that we haven't seen people standing up yet
[01:39:58.306 --> 01:39:59.767]  You know, in large numbers.
[01:39:59.927 --> 01:40:03.249]  Where is the mainstream outrage to this whole thing?
[01:40:03.589 --> 01:40:08.812]  As the TSA has risen to power, remember when it was first that the pat-downs weren't as bad?
[01:40:08.832 --> 01:40:14.114]  And then it became the enhanced aggressive pat-downs, fingers down your pants, up your skirt, whatever.
[01:40:14.755 --> 01:40:16.175]  You know, where's the outrage?
[01:40:16.436 --> 01:40:17.496]  Why did people go along with it?
[01:40:19.097 --> 01:40:20.678]  That's the million dollar question right there.
[01:40:23.024 --> 01:40:24.224]  I understand you've got some footage.
[01:40:25.505 --> 01:40:28.226]  Yeah, we are going to be featuring a video hopefully next hour.
[01:40:28.526 --> 01:40:33.307]  It's crashing down on the computer right now, so it's one of those things you hope it's going to be ready.
[01:40:33.967 --> 01:40:35.308]  But it's Alex at the Capitol.
[01:40:35.408 --> 01:40:45.511]  Just a few clips from his speeches that he gave in front of the Senate, shouting them down, gathering with the other protesters and going through the security and pointing out how to
[01:40:46.511 --> 01:40:53.298]  Ordinary people have to go through the scanners, put their belongings through the metal detector, walk through.
[01:40:53.999 --> 01:40:58.203]  But the lobbyists and the senators, they just walk through with a fast ID card.
[01:40:58.684 --> 01:41:05.250]  And that's the real problem with the TSA grope downs, is they're really trying to force us onto an ID system.
[01:41:05.270 --> 01:41:09.395]  A mandatory background... You said the lobbyists get through?
[01:41:10.581 --> 01:41:11.481]  With the quick cards?
[01:41:11.921 --> 01:41:15.402]  Well, I think that's, you know, I'm not sure who exactly we're seeing.
[01:41:15.422 --> 01:41:17.483]  I wasn't aware of that.
[01:41:17.503 --> 01:41:18.163]  I mean, that's new.
[01:41:18.223 --> 01:41:19.443]  It looks obvious to me.
[01:41:19.483 --> 01:41:21.064]  It could have been a member of the House.
[01:41:21.124 --> 01:41:24.545]  But there are a certain select number of people who get through with the card.
[01:41:24.585 --> 01:41:26.165]  They don't have to go through the security.
[01:41:26.605 --> 01:41:28.606]  So you have the elite pass card.
[01:41:29.646 --> 01:41:33.527]  If you're a member of the elite, you don't have to be molested at the airport.
[01:41:34.067 --> 01:41:37.848]  Yeah, in a certain way at the White House and at the airport, yeah.
[01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:39.562]  Sick though, isn't it?
[01:41:39.803 --> 01:41:40.907]  Yeah, it's pretty sick.
[01:41:40.927 --> 01:41:45.401]  Well, what it ends up with is a nation where the laws don't apply to those who make the laws.
[01:41:46.739 --> 01:41:46.959]  Right?
[01:41:47.380 --> 01:41:52.803]  I mean, one set of laws for them, another set of laws for you and me and everybody else.
[01:41:53.483 --> 01:41:54.804]  And that's not freedom.
[01:41:54.844 --> 01:41:56.345]  That's not a just society.
[01:41:56.405 --> 01:41:58.886]  Now that's, you know, that's an oligarchy.
[01:41:59.106 --> 01:42:14.776]  That's a corporatocracy, a two-tiered system, where you have the privileged, wealthy, elite, and then you have the underprivileged, GMO-fed, molested masses who are treated like worse than animals.
[01:42:15.633 --> 01:42:21.358]  I think we're seeing the big government always claiming they can take care of you, claiming that they can bring you security.
[01:42:21.638 --> 01:42:22.139]  They can't.
[01:42:22.279 --> 01:42:23.460]  Air travel is unsafe.
[01:42:23.500 --> 01:42:28.244]  How many accidents do they have per year due to pilot error, weather conditions, etc.
[01:42:28.344 --> 01:42:29.004]  etc.
[01:42:29.264 --> 01:42:31.586]  There's no guarantee that there's a safe plane.
[01:42:32.247 --> 01:42:34.549]  How many terror incidents compared with that?
[01:42:34.609 --> 01:42:35.129]  Very few.
[01:42:35.149 --> 01:42:35.710]  Yeah, very few.
[01:42:36.610 --> 01:42:41.092]  It goes back to the Benjamin Franklin quote, don't trade your liberty for security because you're going to have neither.
[01:42:41.112 --> 01:42:42.152]  Of course you're not.
[01:42:42.172 --> 01:42:46.213]  You've got TSA members being caught with child porn on their computers.
[01:42:46.253 --> 01:42:47.994]  That was the case over Easter weekend.
[01:42:48.634 --> 01:42:54.376]  You've got the guys who looted 400,000 some odd dollars of travelers possessions.
[01:42:56.216 --> 01:42:57.618]  Man, that traveler was loaded, huh?
[01:42:57.678 --> 01:42:59.199]  He got my hands in the pants.
[01:42:59.239 --> 01:43:00.420]  Well, for multiple travelers.
[01:43:00.520 --> 01:43:01.241]  Oh, oh, I see.
[01:43:01.281 --> 01:43:02.702]  I was like one guy walking in.
[01:43:02.762 --> 01:43:07.107]  It was a particular case where the guy got caught selling people's cameras on eBay.
[01:43:07.127 --> 01:43:07.187]  Wow.
[01:43:07.707 --> 01:43:10.009]  Kind of high-priced electronics, laptops.
[01:43:10.270 --> 01:43:10.490]  Yeah.
[01:43:10.650 --> 01:43:12.251]  He's been stealing them from travelers.
[01:43:12.612 --> 01:43:15.274]  There's no security from TSA in the airport.
[01:43:15.294 --> 01:43:16.756]  They can't even control their own people.
[01:43:17.196 --> 01:43:23.241]  No, well, and if they're going to show up at everything that might be dangerous, I mean, downhill skiing is dangerous.
[01:43:23.661 --> 01:43:30.426]  If you live in Colorado and you want to snowboard down a hill, is the TSA going to feel your junk before you hit the slopes?
[01:43:30.706 --> 01:43:32.228]  I mean, is that what's coming?
[01:43:32.808 --> 01:43:34.329]  Yeah, I wouldn't give them any ideas.
[01:43:36.371 --> 01:43:37.052]  You're probably right.
[01:43:37.072 --> 01:43:40.174]  We should retract some of these things to the TSA.
[01:43:40.394 --> 01:43:41.335]  They're probably taking notes.
[01:43:41.595 --> 01:43:48.441]  But, you know, the other side that Alex and I have looked into is they really want to de-industrialize the society in many ways.
[01:43:48.461 --> 01:43:52.544]  You see that with Agenda 21, which ties in with the health and food stuff, too.
[01:43:53.305 --> 01:44:01.932]  And they really want to cut back travel, make it only for a select elite few who could pass a background check, the kind of people who are willing to go along with that.
[01:44:02.472 --> 01:44:03.813]  And everyone else to hell with them.
[01:44:03.833 --> 01:44:06.194]  They don't want them leaving their compact areas.
[01:44:06.234 --> 01:44:09.516]  They want them completely dependent and not really able to travel.
[01:44:09.536 --> 01:44:11.077]  Or at least that's what they write about.
[01:44:11.377 --> 01:44:26.065]  What's it going to take, Aaron, for the public backlash to become so large and so powerful and so loud that even the state legislators cannot ignore it anymore and we actually start evicting the TSA out of our airports?
[01:44:26.205 --> 01:44:26.725]  What's it going to take?
[01:44:27.253 --> 01:44:28.934]  Well, I think we have seen a crescendo.
[01:44:29.135 --> 01:44:32.237]  I think, obviously, little girls getting touched on camera.
[01:44:32.677 --> 01:44:37.661]  That's just infuriating for everyone, I think, even those who are not tapped into these issues.
[01:44:38.102 --> 01:44:40.664]  I think that has brought up a lot of the level of the anger.
[01:44:40.684 --> 01:44:47.609]  I remember, too, when travelers were protesting during Thanksgiving about the body scanners and the fall shutdown.
[01:44:47.649 --> 01:44:47.849]  Right.
[01:44:48.770 --> 01:44:49.791]  That was around that time.
[01:44:49.831 --> 01:44:52.453]  They also promised they would no longer grope children.
[01:44:52.994 --> 01:44:54.455]  No longer grope children under 12.
[01:44:54.495 --> 01:44:55.456]  They broke it, of course.
[01:44:55.996 --> 01:45:00.260]  We saw the video with the 6-year-old girl and the 8-year-old boy and everyone else.
[01:45:01.781 --> 01:45:02.822]  If you're not mad about that...
[01:45:03.723 --> 01:45:04.904]  Well, that's the question, isn't it?
[01:45:04.964 --> 01:45:09.469]  I mean, at what point are people going to wake up and actually stand up and take action?
[01:45:09.769 --> 01:45:14.754]  Because, you know, there are a lot of folks out there who, in their own minds, they say, yeah, I'm against that.
[01:45:14.814 --> 01:45:15.835]  Yeah, that's outrageous.
[01:45:16.416 --> 01:45:19.959]  But are you joining a protest?
[01:45:19.999 --> 01:45:22.982]  Are you calling your state lawmakers?
[01:45:23.343 --> 01:45:25.245]  What are you doing actively?
[01:45:25.825 --> 01:45:34.485]  To stand up against this, because remember, it was philosopher Edmund Burke who said, all that's necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men and women do nothing.
[01:45:34.566 --> 01:45:35.588]  I added the and women part.
[01:45:36.383 --> 01:45:37.784]  Because we need women to protest, too.
[01:45:38.024 --> 01:45:38.544]  Oh, for sure.
[01:45:38.564 --> 01:45:39.004]  Yeah.
[01:45:39.524 --> 01:45:46.547]  And it's hard, too, because even people who are conscientious, when you do take a plane, you have to be somewhere, you have plans.
[01:45:47.367 --> 01:45:50.948]  It's hard to step up and take the chance.
[01:45:50.988 --> 01:45:55.630]  You won't get on the flight, or if you leave security, they may strong-arm you and try to sue you.
[01:45:56.230 --> 01:45:59.331]  But obviously, civil disobedience is going to move everything.
[01:45:59.992 --> 01:46:03.793]  And if they're not outraged about touching the private parts of our women and
[01:46:04.213 --> 01:46:13.581]  Mothers and children and brothers and... So you think maybe a Gandhi type of moment is coming in America in its outrage against the TSA?
[01:46:13.601 --> 01:46:23.149]  You know, Gandhi led the march to Dandi to harvest salt from the sea in violation of the occupying British forces, right?
[01:46:23.429 --> 01:46:24.670]  You could not harvest salt.
[01:46:25.411 --> 01:46:28.914]  And Gandhi said that's a basic human right to be able to take salt out of the ocean.
[01:46:29.474 --> 01:46:30.215]  It's a food.
[01:46:30.796 --> 01:46:32.037]  Are we going to have a Gandhi type of
[01:46:33.373 --> 01:46:34.014]  Backlash?
[01:46:34.854 --> 01:46:35.895]  And who's going to be the Gandhi?
[01:46:36.356 --> 01:46:36.656]  Yeah.
[01:46:37.256 --> 01:46:39.438]  Hopefully a thousand of us instead of just one.
[01:46:39.458 --> 01:46:39.879]  Exactly.
[01:46:40.039 --> 01:46:40.639]  That's what we need.
[01:46:40.739 --> 01:46:41.320]  The masses.
[01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:44.242]  I've got a Gandhi quote here, actually, that Alex fed me.
[01:46:44.663 --> 01:46:48.125]  I see that answer to this, and it was provided by Mohandas Gandhi.
[01:46:48.946 --> 01:46:54.371]  All compromise is based on give and take, but there can be no give and take on fundamentals.
[01:46:54.831 --> 01:46:59.475]  Any compromise on mere fundamentals is a surrender, for it is all give and no take.
[01:46:59.856 --> 01:47:04.980]  That's what our Bill of Rights and Constitution is all about, particularly the Bill of Rights, is our natural rights.
[01:47:05.501 --> 01:47:07.602]  I got the Fourth Amendment right here on a
[01:47:08.303 --> 01:47:10.784]  Nice metallic thing you can carry through the scanners.
[01:47:11.605 --> 01:47:17.567]  Maybe this is the kind of stuff people can use to, you know, when this gets caught in the metal detector, you show them the Fourth Amendment.
[01:47:17.827 --> 01:47:33.775]  The right of the people to be secure in the person's houses and papers against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and no warrant shall even be issued except with probable cause or with an oath and affirmation particularly describing the place of persons to be seized
[01:47:34.575 --> 01:47:36.456]  That's not at all what's going on in the airport.
[01:47:36.476 --> 01:47:37.276]  They have none of those.
[01:47:37.296 --> 01:47:38.697]  The language is pretty clear.
[01:47:39.037 --> 01:47:40.197]  It's extremely clear.
[01:47:40.217 --> 01:47:42.638]  There's not a lot of wiggle room in that.
[01:47:43.178 --> 01:47:48.421]  And it's a buffer against government abuse, but somehow today we just see it differently.
[01:47:48.441 --> 01:47:49.601]  Too much TV or something.
[01:47:49.701 --> 01:48:08.353]  But it seems like the masses are so indoctrinated, they're so maybe over-medicated, they're fluoridated, they have so many chemicals in their heads, I mean physically, chemicals in the bloodstream circulating through their brains that they don't seem to be able to think critically about this, or they've forgotten history, or they never learned history, or they just don't get it.
[01:48:09.634 --> 01:48:20.212]  Look, I want us to be successful in getting the TSA out of our airports, but I'm frustrated that we don't have millions of Americans rising up right now against this outrage.
[01:48:21.874 --> 01:48:28.800]  I want to know where the government whistleblowers are on this, because you have to be a bad person to be okay with going along with these things.
[01:48:29.500 --> 01:48:34.624]  It just keeps advancing and creeping, and all the stories, the Ben Laden death, it's a total hoax.
[01:48:35.225 --> 01:48:39.888]  But they just ask people to go along with it, they know they have to keep the lie going because they're in those positions.
[01:48:40.209 --> 01:48:40.849]  And they ratchet it up.
[01:48:40.869 --> 01:48:41.670]  Who would want to do that?
[01:48:42.443 --> 01:48:44.744]  And yeah, and it gets crazier and crazier.
[01:48:45.124 --> 01:48:47.446]  First a shoe bomber, then an underwear bomber.
[01:48:47.466 --> 01:48:47.866]  Right.
[01:48:48.066 --> 01:48:49.067]  And we don't know what's next.
[01:48:49.127 --> 01:48:53.489]  They said they found dogs with bombs planted in them and sewn inside.
[01:48:53.689 --> 01:49:02.194]  Do you think the TSA might be engineering another false flag type of scenario, theater, to justify more power grabs?
[01:49:03.146 --> 01:49:03.687]  Absolutely.
[01:49:03.727 --> 01:49:06.088]  I think that's something to watch for.
[01:49:06.149 --> 01:49:12.914]  There's going to be small incidences that just kind of catch a headline and then we can only hope there won't be something big.
[01:49:13.014 --> 01:49:18.999]  Well remember in Minnesota, not too long ago, they ran their own bomb drill and didn't even bother to tell the local police.
[01:49:19.059 --> 01:49:19.479]  Remember that?
[01:49:20.280 --> 01:49:22.162]  They had a TSA bomber
[01:49:23.374 --> 01:49:26.777]  Going in there to test their bomb detection processes.
[01:49:27.297 --> 01:49:30.580]  And then the airport cops found out, but they didn't know it was a drill.
[01:49:31.200 --> 01:49:32.621]  And they drew their guns on the guy.
[01:49:33.562 --> 01:49:35.923]  I think that was, I mean, maybe a dry run right there.
[01:49:36.244 --> 01:49:36.464]  Yeah.
[01:49:36.824 --> 01:49:44.150]  You know, just to see how will the police react if the TSA starts to have its own bombing type of people moving into security checkpoints.
[01:49:45.170 --> 01:49:48.513]  Yeah, I would not be surprised to see something like that.
[01:49:49.053 --> 01:49:49.894]  It's all theater, isn't it?
[01:49:51.190 --> 01:49:53.413]  Well, theater and the control grid, I think.
[01:49:55.095 --> 01:49:56.257]  Man, it's pretty crazy.
[01:49:56.277 --> 01:50:01.424]  Well, if you're listening to this right now, of course, you are part of the unusually well-informed.
[01:50:01.884 --> 01:50:08.133]  So please spread this message, get the information out there, share the URL of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:50:08.533 --> 01:50:09.614]  Wear the t-shirts, right?
[01:50:09.894 --> 01:50:15.456]  I mean, get this information out there to people because it's going to depend on folks like you to wake up others.
[01:50:15.817 --> 01:50:24.421]  You gotta tap the guy next to you on the shoulder and wake them up and say, hey, look, your rights are being taken away to the point where your children are being groped at the prom!
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:26.520]  Come on!
[01:50:27.241 --> 01:50:29.282]  By the way, we were at the Capitol two days ago.
[01:50:29.302 --> 01:50:33.223]  A lot of those activists are back there today, right now, at noon.
[01:50:33.803 --> 01:50:39.886]  Still pressuring the Congress to do the right thing on the bill, bring it back to the floor, pass it.
[01:50:40.166 --> 01:50:42.847]  You know, they had 30 out of 31 senators on that vote.
[01:50:42.867 --> 01:50:44.008]  Just about out of time here, Aaron.
[01:50:44.828 --> 01:50:45.728]  Awesome segment here.
[01:50:46.048 --> 01:50:46.388]  Thank you.
[01:50:46.609 --> 01:50:47.249]  Stay with us, folks.
[01:50:47.269 --> 01:50:48.489]  There's more on the other side of this.
[01:50:48.529 --> 01:50:52.231]  We will continue to bring you information about the TSA tyranny on America.
[01:51:01.547 --> 01:51:05.929]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about a product the drug companies don't want you to know about.
[01:51:06.089 --> 01:51:07.490]  It's called Osteo-K.
[01:51:07.830 --> 01:51:14.993]  Osteo-K is an osteoporosis supplement shown to decrease fractures 87% without any of the dangerous side effects of medications.
[01:51:15.293 --> 01:51:17.814]  Calcium and vitamin D only decrease fractures by 16%.
[01:51:18.855 --> 01:51:21.136]  Osteo-K decreases fractures an astounding 87%.
[01:51:21.176 --> 01:51:24.677]  Friends, osteoporosis is a deadly disease.
[01:51:24.917 --> 01:51:29.279]  Research shows the most effective approach for protecting your bones is not a drug at all.
[01:51:29.460 --> 01:51:30.160]  It's Osteo-K.
[01:51:30.680 --> 01:51:37.144]  Manufactured entirely in America, Osteo-K is available without a prescription and comes with an unconditional money-back guarantee.
[01:51:37.405 --> 01:51:43.629]  Don't wait until it's too late, because if you have osteoporosis and fracture a hip, you have a 20% chance of dying within a year.
[01:51:43.889 --> 01:51:45.930]  I urge you to take charge of your health today.
[01:51:46.170 --> 01:51:48.152]  I cannot recommend this breakthrough product enough.
[01:51:48.392 --> 01:51:51.154]  Go to www.nbihealth.com or call 800-624-1416 right now.
[01:51:51.614 --> 01:51:51.994]  That's 800-624-1416.
[01:51:52.034 --> 01:51:52.935]  Start taking Osteo-K.
[01:52:01.141 --> 01:52:04.183]  Will I have garlic breath after I take Ali-C?
[01:52:04.503 --> 01:52:08.527]  We get that question all the time about the world's best garlic extract, Ali-C.
[01:52:08.847 --> 01:52:17.395]  And the answer is, Ali-C contains stabilized allicin, nature's antimicrobial agent, and the active ingredient in crushed garlic, but will not give you garlic breath.
[01:52:17.695 --> 01:52:24.681]  Scientifically proven in double-blind studies, using low doses of allicin greatly reduces the number, severity, and duration of common colds.
[01:52:24.961 --> 01:52:28.822]  Our powerful Ali-C contains 300 milligrams of stabilized allicin.
[01:52:29.102 --> 01:52:32.903]  Just one tablet of Ali-C is equivalent to 40 garlic cloves.
[01:52:33.203 --> 01:52:39.965]  It's effective against asthma, MRSA, bacterial fungal, and viral infections, and helps lower high blood pressure and high cholesterol.
[01:52:40.065 --> 01:52:42.026]  Plus, it's a natural mosquito repellent.
[01:52:42.166 --> 01:52:45.087]  Boosts resistance to infection with nature's best garlic extract.
[01:52:45.427 --> 01:52:50.554]  Ali C. For more information and to order Ali C., call 877-888-7126 or go to GarlicHealthProducts.com.
[01:52:50.594 --> 01:52:52.677]  That's 877-888-7126 or GarlicHealthProducts.com.
[01:52:52.697 --> 01:52:53.498]  Fight back with Ali C.
[01:53:00.487 --> 01:53:01.748]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:53:01.788 --> 01:53:07.131]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:53:07.371 --> 01:53:12.014]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:53:12.395 --> 01:53:17.438]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:53:17.958 --> 01:53:22.661]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:53:23.182 --> 01:53:25.123]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:53:25.503 --> 01:53:30.106]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:53:30.306 --> 01:53:31.207]  And here's the best part.
[01:53:31.427 --> 01:53:34.189]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:53:34.509 --> 01:53:37.811]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:53:38.112 --> 01:53:40.953]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:53:41.314 --> 01:53:43.195]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:53:43.535 --> 01:53:44.456]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:53:49.460 --> 01:53:51.802]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:53:52.322 --> 01:53:56.827]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:53:57.147 --> 01:53:59.550]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:54:13.522 --> 01:54:15.124]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:15.264 --> 01:54:22.270]  You just heard a segment about the TSA and what might be some of the answers to the tyranny of the TSA that's taking over America today.
[01:54:22.290 --> 01:54:29.816]  It's a rise to power of an agency that must be kept in check if we hope to have any kind of freedom left in America.
[01:54:30.933 --> 01:54:36.698]  Now, a lot of the things you hear here on the Alex Jones Show, you might initially think, well, where's this coming from?
[01:54:36.718 --> 01:54:38.059]  You know, like, what?
[01:54:38.279 --> 01:54:40.100]  Hey, Alex isn't making this stuff up.
[01:54:40.521 --> 01:54:41.601]  I'm not making this stuff up.
[01:54:41.621 --> 01:54:42.662]  Aaron isn't making it up.
[01:54:43.483 --> 01:54:46.645]  We are reporting what's really going on underneath
[01:54:47.671 --> 01:54:54.574]  Behind the scenes, let's say, the undercurrents that are going to come out and emerge and affect you if we don't change things right now.
[01:54:55.054 --> 01:55:04.018]  For example, mainstream media is not going to tell you that the TSA can rise to become a new Nazi type of secret police power in America.
[01:55:04.318 --> 01:55:05.219]  They're not going to see that.
[01:55:05.979 --> 01:55:07.419]  But Alex Jones can see that.
[01:55:07.839 --> 01:55:12.420]  I call Alex the matrix decoder because he can look at the news.
[01:55:12.440 --> 01:55:13.780]  He sees the matrix.
[01:55:13.800 --> 01:55:24.522]  He sees everything going on and he can decode it and he can see the agenda behind it and underneath it and he can see where it's going and what's going to happen if we don't put a stop to it and keep these tyrants in line.
[01:55:24.542 --> 01:55:27.743]  That's why it's so cool to listen to Alex and see his take on things.
[01:55:28.443 --> 01:55:32.924]  He has just an amazing ability to bring together a lot of information and understand it.
[01:55:33.874 --> 01:55:34.956]  I mean, he should be an analyst.
[01:55:34.976 --> 01:55:43.428]  He should be a top-level analyst for some government, but of course he wouldn't want that role because he wants to be talking to the public and not just working behind the scenes.
[01:55:43.488 --> 01:55:47.974]  But he's that brilliant in analyzing the information, the matrix decoder.
[01:55:49.176 --> 01:55:52.520]  Also, when you hear this information, you might say, what are the answers to this?
[01:55:52.620 --> 01:55:53.561]  What can we do?
[01:55:53.581 --> 01:55:57.626]  I always want to give you solutions when I'm filling in hosting here.
[01:55:57.646 --> 01:55:59.168]  I want to leave you with some solutions.
[01:55:59.649 --> 01:56:04.635]  And I'm only on for a couple more minutes, and then Aaron's going to be talking with Bob Chapman on the other side at the top of the hour.
[01:56:05.195 --> 01:56:07.919]  But I want to leave you with some solutions, because I think that's important.
[01:56:08.837 --> 01:56:10.458]  The solution to tyranny is liberty.
[01:56:11.058 --> 01:56:13.098]  The solution is always freedom and liberty.
[01:56:13.138 --> 01:56:18.900]  That's how we take back our rights and our freedoms and stop tyranny from overtaking our country.
[01:56:19.861 --> 01:56:26.803]  The solution to out-of-control government is people like Ron Paul, and more importantly, the philosophy that Ron Paul stands for.
[01:56:27.143 --> 01:56:30.424]  It's not the person, it's the philosophy that they adhere to.
[01:56:30.845 --> 01:56:37.427]  Because we don't want to put up, even Ron Paul, we don't want to make him a god-like figure he is.
[01:56:38.047 --> 01:56:41.611]  The reason that we admire him is because of his philosophy.
[01:56:42.172 --> 01:56:43.934]  We don't want you to worship any one individual.
[01:56:44.214 --> 01:56:45.816]  Even Alex says, don't worship him.
[01:56:46.556 --> 01:56:48.058]  Don't worship me or anybody.
[01:56:48.378 --> 01:56:56.467]  You should adhere to the principles and then believe in your own power to be part of making a difference in this country.
[01:56:57.694 --> 01:56:58.895]  Based on those principles.
[01:56:59.195 --> 01:57:05.718]  And that's what Ron Paul believes, that's what Rand Paul believes, I know that's what Alex believes, and that's a philosophy that I adhere to as well.
[01:57:06.178 --> 01:57:09.920]  So, the solution to tyranny is freedom and liberty.
[01:57:10.400 --> 01:57:19.045]  And the solution to health, or the disease that's out there, and the sick care system that is bankrupting our nation, the solution to that is health freedom.
[01:57:19.565 --> 01:57:19.725]  I think?
[01:57:49.825 --> 01:57:58.830]  We need to make that law so that we have the ability to choose what kind of health care that we wish to have for ourselves and our children.
[01:57:59.030 --> 01:58:06.353]  Hey, if you want to go get vaccinated, that's your choice, but don't push your vaccines on me and my family or my children.
[01:58:06.634 --> 01:58:18.700]  Don't force me to take your Western medicine, your radiotherapy, and your chemotherapy for cancer, when I know that there are Amazonian herbs that can cure cancer far better, more effectively, and with no toxic side effects.
[01:58:19.660 --> 01:58:21.620]  The answer is right out there.
[01:58:21.640 --> 01:58:24.621]  The answer is freedom and the answer is health freedom in the health world.
[01:58:25.221 --> 01:58:26.981]  Thanks for joining us today on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:58:27.441 --> 01:58:29.622]  Aaron is on the other side of this break with Bob Chapman.
[01:58:29.642 --> 01:58:30.102]  Take care.
[01:58:42.744 --> 01:58:44.624]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:58:52.216 --> 01:58:53.718]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:58:53.938 --> 01:58:58.963]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:58:59.243 --> 01:59:00.604]  Saving means to make money.
[01:59:00.785 --> 01:59:09.573]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:59:10.294 --> 01:59:17.399]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:59:17.839 --> 01:59:25.444]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:59:25.844 --> 01:59:30.767]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[01:59:54.161 --> 01:59:56.062]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.542 --> 01:59:59.324]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.885 --> 02:00:10.088]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.728 --> 02:00:11.529]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.309 --> 02:00:13.210]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.850 --> 02:00:17.452]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.053 --> 02:00:22.155]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:35.046 --> 02:00:37.327]  Okay, we are back in the third hour.
[02:00:37.487 --> 02:00:45.750]  It is now Aaron Dyke sitting in, again passing the baton from Paul Watson and Mike Adams of Natural News.
[02:00:46.450 --> 02:00:52.072]  It's been a power-packed week for tyranny as well as resistance, all the TSA news going on, the
[02:00:53.212 --> 02:00:58.356]  Patriot Act extensions again passed without any resistance other than Rand Paul.
[02:00:59.237 --> 02:01:01.018]  Obama signed them right away, of course.
[02:01:01.619 --> 02:01:08.784]  Also a headline from Paul Joseph Watson, Obama's promise to veto worldwide war bill rings hollow.
[02:01:08.804 --> 02:01:11.346]  We'll get into some of those issues right now.
[02:01:11.386 --> 02:01:17.812]  We have Bob Chapman, the international forecaster, preeminent economist and frequent guest, as you know.
[02:01:18.552 --> 02:01:19.293]  Bob, are you there?
[02:01:20.598 --> 02:01:23.239]  I certainly am, and it's very nice to be on with you again.
[02:01:23.259 --> 02:01:24.899]  Yeah, it's nice to speak with you.
[02:01:25.839 --> 02:01:27.580]  So what would you like to get into first?
[02:01:27.620 --> 02:01:32.741]  We've got the continuing eroding economy, we have all the TSA news, creeping tyranny.
[02:01:34.082 --> 02:01:36.102]  What's most important?
[02:01:37.002 --> 02:01:42.544]  I think Texas has learned a very good lesson from our federal government.
[02:01:43.964 --> 02:01:49.506]  That federal government has become dictatorial, and if you try to
[02:01:51.159 --> 02:01:54.580]  Cancel what they'd like to do, then you're threatened.
[02:01:55.980 --> 02:02:04.242]  And I'm unhappy to say that the threat worked with the legislators in Texas.
[02:02:05.062 --> 02:02:06.082]  I thought it was hollow.
[02:02:07.022 --> 02:02:08.223]  I didn't think they'd do it.
[02:02:08.723 --> 02:02:09.943]  I think it was a bluff.
[02:02:11.323 --> 02:02:14.864]  And we'll never know, I guess.
[02:02:15.444 --> 02:02:20.085]  But if I was Texas, I'd turn around and go back and change it.
[02:02:21.650 --> 02:02:22.330]  Absolutely.
[02:02:22.870 --> 02:02:24.031]  How could it not be a bluff?
[02:02:24.051 --> 02:02:34.733]  They're going to shut down four or five major cities, as well as other smaller airports, and have no flight when it's a major part of the economy, which is already, you know, on the downward path?
[02:02:36.434 --> 02:02:51.077]  And you've got two, well, I'll call them change centers, in Dallas and Houston, where many of the airlines change carriers or planes to go to
[02:02:51.849 --> 02:02:56.411]  Mexico, Central and South America, as well as other parts of the United States.
[02:02:56.511 --> 02:02:58.692]  It's a strong focal point.
[02:02:59.412 --> 02:03:03.774]  And you've got the second largest population in the United States.
[02:03:03.834 --> 02:03:05.475]  So I don't think they would have done it.
[02:03:06.195 --> 02:03:09.817]  And perhaps some of these legislators were just looking for a way out.
[02:03:10.777 --> 02:03:13.999]  But that's up to the people in Texas to take care of.
[02:03:15.359 --> 02:03:19.581]  All those who voted against the people, we'll put it.
[02:03:20.590 --> 02:03:22.232]  Uh, they should be kicked out of office.
[02:03:23.253 --> 02:03:30.979]  And it's the same thing with the people who voted for the four year extension of the Patriot Act.
[02:03:32.140 --> 02:03:33.881]  Uh, they should be kicked out of office too.
[02:03:33.901 --> 02:03:39.666]  Um, I think the vote for, if I remember correctly, it was 53.
[02:03:40.867 --> 02:03:43.229]  So the vote against must have been very large.
[02:03:43.970 --> 02:03:48.674]  And so, you know, you go look them up and, and if they belong to your district, uh,
[02:03:49.235 --> 02:03:51.000]  Make sure you get them canned next time.
[02:03:51.020 --> 02:03:53.205]  Because that was very important legislation.
[02:03:55.899 --> 02:04:01.262]  Well, in Texas, we also have Governor Perry most likely about to announce a bid for president.
[02:04:01.742 --> 02:04:08.566]  Now he didn't have to sign what might have been a very controversial legislation for all the statist Republican supporters out there.
[02:04:09.627 --> 02:04:18.012]  But as far as the MO of the threat of shutting down air traffic, it's almost exactly like the threat of martial law we saw happening at the time of the bailouts.
[02:04:18.052 --> 02:04:21.814]  They said, if you didn't pass this, the sky will fall, et cetera, et cetera.
[02:04:23.675 --> 02:04:25.096]  And they fall for it.
[02:04:25.962 --> 02:04:26.803]  And it's a shame.
[02:04:27.944 --> 02:04:38.155]  We need more people with guts, and obviously Texas and the United States House and Senate as well are gutless.
[02:04:38.876 --> 02:04:40.297]  Okay, we're headed into break, Bob.
[02:04:40.317 --> 02:04:43.060]  We'll be back on the other side to get more into this.
[02:04:43.140 --> 02:04:45.843]  We also have an exclusive Alex Jones video coming up.
[02:04:46.304 --> 02:04:48.286]  I'm Eric Dykes, InfoWars.com.
[02:04:53.068 --> 02:04:53.891]  We're good.
[02:05:01.138 --> 02:05:05.361]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:05:05.681 --> 02:05:06.282]  Number 1.
[02:05:06.582 --> 02:05:09.744]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:10.025 --> 02:05:10.565]  Number 2.
[02:05:10.885 --> 02:05:15.429]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:05:15.769 --> 02:05:16.209]  It's true.
[02:05:16.509 --> 02:05:21.073]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:21.393 --> 02:05:21.933]  Number 3.
[02:05:22.214 --> 02:05:25.496]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:05:25.796 --> 02:05:29.499]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:05:29.699 --> 02:05:30.240]  Number 4.
[02:05:30.500 --> 02:05:32.862]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:05:33.263 --> 02:05:36.626]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:05:36.947 --> 02:05:37.147]  Number 5.
[02:05:37.727 --> 02:05:41.652]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:05:41.872 --> 02:05:46.637]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:06:00.959 --> 02:06:03.762]  It could never happen in America, but it's happening right now.
[02:06:03.942 --> 02:06:07.305]  Gas prices are exploding past the incomes of millions of families.
[02:06:07.585 --> 02:06:14.051]  As gas prices and crop failures push high food costs, you can still get the best food on the planet from eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:06:14.191 --> 02:06:19.376]  Demand for food is high, but eFoodsDirect has plenty of radiation-free food to meet your needs.

[02:06:54.298 --> 02:06:55.379]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:06:55.439 --> 02:06:59.863]  citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:07:09.051 --> 02:07:11.332]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:07:11.592 --> 02:07:16.794]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:07:16.974 --> 02:07:19.755]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:07:20.015 --> 02:07:22.135]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:07:22.335 --> 02:07:28.277]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:07:28.597 --> 02:07:31.778]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:07:31.959 --> 02:07:33.359]  Recently, he created a video
[02:07:33.499 --> 02:07:33.739]  We're good.
[02:08:01.573 --> 02:08:06.335]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:06.695 --> 02:08:08.856]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:28.695 --> 02:08:30.577]  We are back on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:30.657 --> 02:08:31.418]  I'm Aaron Dyke.
[02:08:31.538 --> 02:08:48.436]  Sitting in on the line with me is Bob Chapman, our regular Friday guest, and we are discussing the terrible tyranny in the passing of the Patriot Act extensions and the rejection of a bill to check the powers, the unconstitutional powers, of the TSA.
[02:08:49.297 --> 02:08:50.078]  Bob Chapman,
[02:08:50.778 --> 02:08:59.782]  Where do you see things going as the depression sets in, as the economy falls, and as these agencies ask for even more power?
[02:09:02.383 --> 02:09:05.524]  You know, I think you can expect them to do just that.
[02:09:06.505 --> 02:09:18.890]  They will take the opportunity that is created by economic and financial repression to continue to suppress the American people.
[02:09:20.112 --> 02:09:21.993]  And to me, that's a given.
[02:09:23.173 --> 02:09:29.736]  You know, I've seen too much of this in the past in many countries, and I've read about it as well.
[02:09:30.717 --> 02:09:32.957]  And that's where I think this is headed.
[02:09:32.977 --> 02:09:48.284]  I think people should be finally realizing that no matter what you think, nothing is getting done to reflect your thoughts, desires,
[02:09:50.956 --> 02:09:52.097]  By the U.S.
[02:09:52.137 --> 02:09:54.719]  Senate and the House of Representatives.
[02:09:55.240 --> 02:10:01.545]  And obviously that goes for other state positions as well.
[02:10:03.346 --> 02:10:09.912]  The recovery that we are supposed to be experiencing doesn't exist.
[02:10:11.333 --> 02:10:17.618]  And it's very, very disheartening for Americans to know
[02:10:18.303 --> 02:10:22.766]  That we've had QE1, Stimulus 1, QE2, Stimulus 2.
[02:10:24.147 --> 02:10:30.631]  And all we have done is held our nose above water.
[02:10:30.651 --> 02:10:42.739]  And let's stop for a minute and think, well, what would the numbers would have been like had there not been Stimulus 1, QE1?
[02:10:44.060 --> 02:10:46.882]  Instead of plus two, two and a half percent,
[02:10:47.794 --> 02:10:50.676]  A growth in GDP probably would have been even.
[02:10:51.576 --> 02:10:54.518]  And now we get QE2 and stimulus too.
[02:10:55.799 --> 02:10:58.500]  And it probably would have been minus two.
[02:10:59.381 --> 02:11:05.684]  Because I think by the end of the year, you're going to find out that we're going to get a plus two to two and a half, which we predicted a year ago.
[02:11:06.645 --> 02:11:11.067]  And I think that should teach people something.
[02:11:11.928 --> 02:11:14.849]  That throwing money at the problem is not solving it.
[02:11:15.410 --> 02:11:15.730]  Sure.
[02:11:17.014 --> 02:11:20.316]  The first set bailed out Wall Street and banking.
[02:11:21.076 --> 02:11:25.259]  The second set of funds, that bailed out the U.S.
[02:11:25.279 --> 02:11:25.679]  government.
[02:11:27.120 --> 02:11:37.586]  The third set of funds, and I can promise you we're going to get it, because if we don't get it, the whole system will collapse.
[02:11:38.646 --> 02:11:40.928]  And if we do get it, it'll be called by another name.
[02:11:42.729 --> 02:11:45.250]  Maybe an extension of two or something like that.
[02:11:46.014 --> 02:11:57.138]  And we're not going to see any help from the legislature in Washington like we've seen in 1 and 2, the stimulus.
[02:11:58.058 --> 02:12:02.500]  The first one was $850 billion, the second was $862 billion.
[02:12:03.520 --> 02:12:04.460]  There won't be a third.
[02:12:05.521 --> 02:12:14.404]  Now, in order to cover 80% of the Treasury offerings over the next year or so,
[02:12:16.480 --> 02:12:21.101]  The Federal Reserve will have to buy $1.6 trillion worth of paper.
[02:12:22.162 --> 02:12:23.522]  And that's a ballpark figure.
[02:12:24.662 --> 02:12:45.568]  Going into the economy itself, which will need some sort of stimulus, they will have to provide probably another $800 or $900 billion, just like before, like the legislation did.
[02:12:46.630 --> 02:12:49.992]  And so these are the kind of numbers we're talking about.
[02:12:50.973 --> 02:13:06.444]  And the flip side to all of that is right now we are experiencing the inflation that's been created by Stimulus-1 and QE-1.
[02:13:08.025 --> 02:13:10.887]  Real inflation right now is approximately 10%.
[02:13:12.508 --> 02:13:15.010]  Last May I said that it would be
[02:13:18.247 --> 02:13:19.107]  14% by the end of the year.
[02:13:19.928 --> 02:13:20.748]  And I stick with that.
[02:13:20.768 --> 02:13:21.969]  I think that's conservative.
[02:13:22.730 --> 02:13:29.554]  QE2 is going to come through the pipeline, but stimulus too, over the next year, year and a half.
[02:13:30.295 --> 02:13:34.938]  That should take us to 25, 30% based upon what we see now.
[02:13:34.958 --> 02:13:41.082]  And if they do a QE3, is that going to take us to 50%?
[02:13:41.763 --> 02:13:43.204]  I don't know, but it's not good.
[02:13:44.385 --> 02:13:46.006]  And so these are the sacrifices
[02:13:46.943 --> 02:13:52.727]  That are being made to keep a system afloat in which there's really no growth.
[02:13:54.048 --> 02:13:55.629]  And it's decimating the dollar.
[02:13:56.190 --> 02:14:00.913]  Now, mind you, all currencies are in dreadful shape.
[02:14:01.954 --> 02:14:03.275]  Just some are better than others.
[02:14:04.716 --> 02:14:12.802]  And the dollar, the world's reserve currency, has continued to go down in value against other currencies.
[02:14:13.542 --> 02:14:14.503]  And that will continue.
[02:14:14.983 --> 02:14:15.884]  There'll be exceptions.
[02:14:17.079 --> 02:14:18.000]  But it will continue.
[02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:41.352]  And at the same time, people should be reminded that over the past 11 years, on average, every year, nine major currencies have fallen in value each year by over 20% against gold and silver.
[02:14:43.013 --> 02:14:45.694]  Now, that varies from currency to currency, of course.
[02:14:46.158 --> 02:14:50.079]  But the strong point is, you don't want to be in currencies.
[02:14:51.260 --> 02:14:52.600]  Only what you have to use.
[02:14:54.421 --> 02:15:02.344]  And if that's any criteria, historically, then you want to be in gold and silver coins and bullion and shares.
[02:15:03.645 --> 02:15:06.226]  That seems to me the only safe place to be.
[02:15:06.846 --> 02:15:09.447]  And so that's where we're headed.
[02:15:10.727 --> 02:15:15.289]  And if there's no QE3 or something like it, get ready.
[02:15:16.471 --> 02:15:17.232]  Well, absolutely.
[02:15:39.113 --> 02:15:42.354]  Well, I think you're absolutely correct in citing the fact that
[02:16:09.255 --> 02:16:11.035]  Americans really haven't fought back.
[02:16:11.876 --> 02:16:13.216]  It's governmental policy.
[02:16:13.416 --> 02:16:13.936]  It started in 1967.
[02:16:14.656 --> 02:16:33.360]  It got warmed up in 1980 when major manufacturers started to move their production to foreign shores, whether it was China or India or Mexico or Argentina and Brazil, etc.
[02:16:34.360 --> 02:16:35.741]  And that's when that movement began.
[02:16:35.821 --> 02:16:36.581]  I wrote about it.
[02:16:37.350 --> 02:16:40.592]  In 1967, of course, as usual, nobody was listening.
[02:16:41.592 --> 02:16:51.357]  And so what we've got today is planned obsolescence of the entire American economy.
[02:16:52.858 --> 02:16:55.019]  And you say to yourself, why?
[02:16:55.779 --> 02:17:05.944]  Well, the people who are behind the scenes, who have bought 95% of our legislatures, legislators in Washington,
[02:17:07.031 --> 02:17:07.972]  They want it that way.
[02:17:09.173 --> 02:17:23.925]  And the transnational corporations who are engaged in this for the most part, not only do they get to make more profits, but the profits are kept outside the United States and they're not taxed.
[02:17:25.747 --> 02:17:29.670]  So you say to yourself, gee, how can they have such a thing?
[02:17:30.831 --> 02:17:35.795]  Incidentally, it was about four and a half years ago
[02:17:36.738 --> 02:17:45.625]  That these corporations promised Congress that they create many jobs if they let them bring money back into the country.
[02:17:46.766 --> 02:17:48.067]  And Congress says that's okay.
[02:17:48.087 --> 02:17:50.308]  They brought back $350 billion.
[02:17:51.629 --> 02:17:55.712]  But instead of paying 33% taxation, they were given a gift.
[02:17:56.813 --> 02:17:59.435]  They paid 5.25% and they want to do it again.
[02:18:00.196 --> 02:18:04.499]  But this time, the number's $2 trillion.
[02:18:06.457 --> 02:18:08.398]  And they don't want to pay any taxes at all.
[02:18:11.060 --> 02:18:15.262]  And, you know, I don't know what Washington's thinking about.
[02:18:16.043 --> 02:18:26.709]  Otherwise, the people who are there, who are getting paid off, they don't care one bit about the American people and they're supposed to be representing them.
[02:18:27.329 --> 02:18:29.130]  So what have we lost?
[02:18:29.150 --> 02:18:30.831]  11 years, 11 million jobs.
[02:18:30.851 --> 02:18:31.291]  440,000 businesses.
[02:18:37.443 --> 02:18:41.705]  It's been not only debilitating, it's been terribly destructive.
[02:18:42.625 --> 02:18:46.647]  And so, you know, someone jumps up and says, well, how do you change that?
[02:18:47.047 --> 02:18:47.987]  Well, it's pretty simple.
[02:18:49.228 --> 02:18:57.852]  All you have to do is have Congress implement tariffs and goods and services to create a level playing field.
[02:18:59.552 --> 02:19:01.053]  They don't even discuss such things.
[02:19:02.113 --> 02:19:05.875]  They're very happy to allow the American economy
[02:19:06.727 --> 02:19:07.728]  We're good to go.
[02:19:32.506 --> 02:19:39.971]  Well, it's a form of globalization so they can be a ruling class against a mainly feudal set of people.
[02:19:39.991 --> 02:19:42.072]  We're going to be back right after the break, Bob.
[02:19:42.493 --> 02:19:48.677]  And then we also have an exclusive video of Alex coming up just about 10 or 15 minutes from now.
[02:19:49.177 --> 02:19:50.278]  Should be very interesting.

[02:20:37.028 --> 02:20:42.732]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:20:42.832 --> 02:20:46.254]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[02:21:01.184 --> 02:21:02.725]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:21:02.985 --> 02:21:18.477]  The earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear disaster that killed thousands of Japanese citizens is nothing compared to the devastation that could be caused by hyperinflation that will soon hit the United States and could lead to millions of Americans becoming homeless, all caused by the devalued U.S.
[02:21:18.557 --> 02:21:18.838]  dollar.
[02:21:18.898 --> 02:21:24.342]  While the mainstream media continues to ignore inflation, our friends at the National Inflation Association provide.
[02:21:24.562 --> 02:21:29.566]  A free weekly newsletter that educates Americans of the facts and truth about the US economy and inflation.
[02:21:29.786 --> 02:21:39.572]  I urge you to sign up at the NIA's free newsletter at www.inflation.us to learn how you can not only survive, but prosper during the upcoming hyperinflation crisis.

[02:23:31.778 --> 02:23:36.160]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:23:36.340 --> 02:23:42.042]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.

[02:24:23.584 --> 02:24:26.247]  We are back at the heart of the fight against tyranny.
[02:24:26.347 --> 02:24:28.449]  I'm Aaron Dyke, sitting in for Alex.
[02:24:29.069 --> 02:24:40.120]  It's been a very tricky week with tyranny, TNA, uh, TNA, TSA, weaseling their way into people's pants, expanding to prom dates.
[02:24:41.080 --> 02:24:47.625]  Trying to take over trains, hotels, shopping malls, bus stations, sports stadiums.
[02:24:48.326 --> 02:24:50.888]  Where on earth do they get this mission creep?
[02:24:50.928 --> 02:24:59.134]  We have Bob Chapman on the line and we're discussing this gross overreach of power as well as the de-industrialization of our nation.
[02:25:00.094 --> 02:25:07.280]  Bob, how do they expand their mandate when we have a budget crisis and when there's more and more demand for weaker and weaker money?
[02:25:09.403 --> 02:25:13.747]  Well, I think you can compare it favorably with the early 1930s.
[02:25:14.267 --> 02:25:24.095]  Where did Adolf Hitler get the money to continue with the brown shirts which evolved into the S.A.
[02:25:24.595 --> 02:25:25.336]  and the S.S.?
[02:25:26.997 --> 02:25:28.399]  He founded or created it.
[02:25:29.319 --> 02:25:31.461]  And that's what they're doing in Washington.
[02:25:32.442 --> 02:25:33.883]  Money means nothing to them.
[02:25:34.644 --> 02:25:36.125]  It's just a means to an end.
[02:25:37.120 --> 02:25:39.741]  And if they have to create it, well, they'll do so.
[02:25:40.882 --> 02:25:42.083]  And that's what they're doing now.
[02:25:42.263 --> 02:25:56.470]  And we discussed that with the usage of the privately owned Federal Reserve and what they're doing in relation with the problems at hand, which are the government is broke.
[02:25:57.271 --> 02:25:59.332]  A good part of business is broke.
[02:26:00.252 --> 02:26:05.275]  And we have these mountainous debts, personal business and
[02:26:06.138 --> 02:26:08.820]  Not only federal government, but municipal and states.
[02:26:09.801 --> 02:26:12.483]  We know the dreadful situation that they're in.
[02:26:13.604 --> 02:26:16.366]  And they're going to start coming home to roost very shortly.
[02:26:17.347 --> 02:26:24.292]  We were looking at 350,000 lost jobs in the municipal area last year, 450 this year.
[02:26:24.812 --> 02:26:27.955]  They're talking in terms of 550 the following year.
[02:26:27.995 --> 02:26:30.457]  And next year starts on July 1st.
[02:26:30.497 --> 02:26:32.958]  I should tell you that that's their fiscal year.
[02:26:33.899 --> 02:26:34.840]  And for the most part,
[02:26:35.547 --> 02:26:41.232]  And so, uh, we want to see what's probably going to happen in America.
[02:26:42.053 --> 02:26:58.426]  Take a look at the pitches that, uh, we're taking the films, uh, in Barcelona over the last several days, the police, not only beating people indiscriminately, um, but also firing on them.
[02:26:59.607 --> 02:27:02.750]  And, uh, it's only a matter of time.
[02:27:03.524 --> 02:27:05.086]  It'll evolve into America.
[02:27:05.866 --> 02:27:11.071]  And that'll happen as the financial and economic system worsens.
[02:27:11.671 --> 02:27:12.332]  And that it will.
[02:27:12.873 --> 02:27:14.954]  You can plan on it.
[02:27:15.715 --> 02:27:18.698]  And so, I think that's the next step in America.
[02:27:19.058 --> 02:27:20.820]  You say, what are you going to do about it?
[02:27:21.280 --> 02:27:23.182]  Well, you go to Congress and there's no response.
[02:27:24.767 --> 02:27:26.608]  I know, the whole system is just rotten.
[02:27:27.108 --> 02:27:31.690]  But as far as this globalization system, we know it's been planned for a long time.
[02:27:31.730 --> 02:27:34.571]  You said you started writing about it in 1967.
[02:27:35.072 --> 02:27:43.015]  I'm looking at a quote from 1969 right here, from a Dr. Richard Day, who worked for Planned Parenthood.
[02:27:43.055 --> 02:27:44.576]  He was a Rockefeller trustee.
[02:27:45.116 --> 02:27:53.480]  And he wrote about how the stated plan would be that different parts of the world would be assigned different roles of industry and commerce in a unified global system.
[02:27:53.980 --> 02:27:57.122]  And that each part of the world would have a specialty.
[02:27:57.162 --> 02:28:00.464]  They'd be interdependent, but also weakened.
[02:28:00.484 --> 02:28:03.906]  And he also writes about how travel would be restricted.
[02:28:03.946 --> 02:28:05.747]  People would have to get permission to travel.
[02:28:05.767 --> 02:28:15.993]  And today we have this trusted traveler background ID system being introduced through the very crisis of outrage over TSA, Bob.
[02:28:16.593 --> 02:28:17.654]  Is it not a plan?
[02:28:17.754 --> 02:28:19.595]  Deindustrialization by design?
[02:28:20.095 --> 02:28:35.255]  Yes it is, and I didn't know this this Dr. Day, but what he said at that time is true and that's the way it's turned out.
[02:28:37.919 --> 02:28:42.222]  I can't remember at the time whether there was any other research I was aware of.
[02:28:43.063 --> 02:28:48.246]  That was just my own feelings and my synopsis of it.
[02:28:48.906 --> 02:28:50.547]  That was the only way they could bring us down.
[02:28:55.569 --> 02:28:58.431]  Sorry, that was when the Packard plant started closing in Detroit, too.
[02:28:58.491 --> 02:28:59.952]  It was kind of the beginning of the end.
[02:28:59.972 --> 02:29:04.174]  I wasn't there, but that's the way I see it, kind of repiecing the history.
[02:29:04.675 --> 02:29:06.055]  But now we're just in the thick of it.
[02:29:06.075 --> 02:29:11.178]  It's just going to be a pure, disgusting rot as things wither away.
[02:29:11.198 --> 02:29:17.782]  I just, I don't know how this system can move into travel and buses and trains so seamlessly.
[02:29:18.163 --> 02:29:20.364]  Is anyone even paying attention to this stuff?
[02:29:22.065 --> 02:29:23.466]  Well, yeah, but they don't know what to do.
[02:29:24.822 --> 02:29:26.223]  There's no overt leadership.
[02:29:27.344 --> 02:29:31.966]  And usually people will react when they have an empty stomach.
[02:29:33.407 --> 02:29:35.508]  And how far away is that?
[02:29:36.128 --> 02:29:41.011]  Well, I see the states cutting back on their unemployment extensions.
[02:29:42.152 --> 02:29:45.874]  And I think the next step after that will be
[02:29:48.224 --> 02:29:51.489]  Okay, we'll be back.
[02:29:51.529 --> 02:29:54.534]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.455 --> 02:29:58.139]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:03.083 --> 02:30:06.704]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:30:07.044 --> 02:30:15.166]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:30:15.906 --> 02:30:19.947]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:30:20.527 --> 02:30:31.349]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:30:31.989 --> 02:30:40.991]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:30:41.491 --> 02:30:46.532]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:30:46.913 --> 02:30:54.074]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:30:54.414 --> 02:30:56.815]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:31:02.310 --> 02:31:05.932]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:31:06.312 --> 02:31:09.314]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:31:09.554 --> 02:31:14.337]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:31:14.357 --> 02:31:20.560]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:31:20.740 --> 02:31:25.706]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:31:36.038 --> 02:31:38.140]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:31:38.380 --> 02:31:39.721]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:31:39.962 --> 02:31:42.244]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:31:42.424 --> 02:31:44.265]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:31:44.566 --> 02:31:49.330]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:31:49.710 --> 02:31:59.059]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:32:00.760 --> 02:32:05.003]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:32:05.323 --> 02:32:05.924]  Number 1.
[02:32:06.224 --> 02:32:09.386]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:32:09.647 --> 02:32:10.207]  Number 2.
[02:32:10.507 --> 02:32:15.071]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:32:15.411 --> 02:32:15.851]  It's true.
[02:32:16.151 --> 02:32:20.715]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:32:21.015 --> 02:32:21.555]  Number 3.
[02:32:21.856 --> 02:32:25.138]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:32:25.438 --> 02:32:29.141]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:32:29.341 --> 02:32:29.881]  Number 4.
[02:32:30.121 --> 02:32:32.502]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:32:32.882 --> 02:32:36.264]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:32:36.564 --> 02:32:36.784]  Number 5.
[02:32:37.364 --> 02:32:41.286]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:32:41.506 --> 02:32:46.268]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:32:46.548 --> 02:32:50.589]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:50.729 --> 02:32:52.290]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:52.510 --> 02:32:57.112]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[02:32:57.432 --> 02:32:57.472]  877-327-0365.
[02:33:19.508 --> 02:33:20.429]  We are back again.
[02:33:20.489 --> 02:33:23.251]  It's the Alex Jones Show, but I'm Aaron Dyk sitting in.
[02:33:23.291 --> 02:33:24.832]  We have Bob Chapman on the line.
[02:33:25.873 --> 02:33:27.635]  Bob, I know things are disintegrating.
[02:33:27.675 --> 02:33:29.937]  I know there's so much importance on the financial stuff.
[02:33:30.257 --> 02:33:45.570]  This week I see things on the TSA front, and I heard what Bob Barr said on the show yesterday, that if you don't stop this thing now, there's no reason to think you're ever going to be able to stop these abuses on the Fourth Amendment, the creeping police state.
[02:33:46.230 --> 02:33:59.740]  And that's why I was just very excited to see Alex and all these people at the Capitol this week demanding from their Congress that they do the right thing and just simply restrict the power of TSA.
[02:34:00.181 --> 02:34:09.768]  You know, Rand Paul was reprimanded for being the only one who wanted to place restrictions on the government and their ability to obtain gun purchase records through the Patriot Act.
[02:34:11.229 --> 02:34:12.070]  Authorizations.
[02:34:12.890 --> 02:34:19.115]  Bob, finishing up, because we're going to play a clip here, where do we see things going from here?
[02:34:19.175 --> 02:34:20.556]  I'm flabbergasted.
[02:34:20.576 --> 02:34:21.337]  I don't know what to say.
[02:34:21.377 --> 02:34:22.638]  I'm so angry about this stuff.
[02:34:23.338 --> 02:34:29.743]  Well, I think the people of Texas should come down on those senators hard, hard, hard, and make a vote all over again.
[02:34:29.763 --> 02:34:31.705]  Put an end to this.
[02:34:33.066 --> 02:34:38.190]  And, you know, the worst thing that can happen
[02:34:38.925 --> 02:34:41.027]  His Texans decide they want to leave the Union.
[02:34:42.067 --> 02:34:42.868]  And that's possible.
[02:34:44.269 --> 02:34:46.951]  And I've heard Alex talk about that before.
[02:34:48.031 --> 02:34:50.213]  And so that's an alternative.
[02:34:51.214 --> 02:34:52.995]  You're not going to get any hearing in Washington.
[02:34:53.035 --> 02:34:53.695]  Nobody cares.
[02:34:54.656 --> 02:35:03.022]  They just, it's a criminal consortium that stretches from the Potomac to the East River.
[02:35:03.923 --> 02:35:05.143]  And it's not going to stop.
[02:35:06.044 --> 02:35:08.606]  Wall Street is entirely and thoroughly corrupt.
[02:35:09.446 --> 02:35:10.807]  And it's not going to get any better.
[02:35:10.847 --> 02:35:11.647]  It's going to get worse.
[02:35:11.667 --> 02:35:16.409]  I mean, just look what's going on over in Europe right now vis-a-vis Greece and other countries.
[02:35:17.029 --> 02:35:21.951]  They're trying to steal everything they've got in the country that belongs to the people of the country.
[02:35:23.252 --> 02:35:24.152]  And they're brazen.
[02:35:25.333 --> 02:35:28.574]  And this standoff could go on for months.
[02:35:29.454 --> 02:35:30.255]  And I hope it does.
[02:35:31.215 --> 02:35:32.236]  And I hope they default.
[02:35:33.536 --> 02:35:37.818]  And eventually, that's what's going to happen with all these countries that are deeply in debt.
[02:35:39.139 --> 02:35:40.240]  There's no way out for them.
[02:35:41.481 --> 02:35:47.544]  And I see some countries now are accumulating gold because they want to get rid of dollars.
[02:35:48.505 --> 02:36:01.713]  And it stretches from China, India, Russia, Thailand, Mexico even, buys a hundred tons of gold, five billion dollars worth.
[02:36:02.293 --> 02:36:06.316]  So there are people out there who are trying to protect their countries.
[02:36:07.369 --> 02:36:08.870]  But we don't have anybody to help us.
[02:36:10.311 --> 02:36:15.455]  And I think that the catalyst will happen when there's enough people hungry.
[02:36:16.977 --> 02:36:19.038]  And that should spark it off.
[02:36:19.899 --> 02:36:27.445]  And you'll see the same thing going on that you've seen this past week in Spain, particularly in Barcelona.
[02:36:28.826 --> 02:36:31.868]  And I spent a lot of time there.
[02:36:33.290 --> 02:36:34.951]  And I know what the people are like.
[02:36:35.959 --> 02:36:37.340]  And they're not going to take it anymore.
[02:36:37.360 --> 02:36:39.402]  That's really what it amounts to.
[02:36:39.702 --> 02:36:41.243]  Maybe too late at that point.
[02:36:41.984 --> 02:36:44.225]  Bob Chapman, it's really great speaking to you again.
[02:36:44.265 --> 02:36:45.286]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:36:46.107 --> 02:36:48.008]  We're going to let you go, Bob.
[02:36:48.789 --> 02:36:49.109]  Thank you.
[02:36:49.930 --> 02:36:52.832]  And we're going to go now to an exclusive video.
[02:36:52.932 --> 02:37:00.618]  It's going to be up on InfoWars and PrisonPlanet.com in the coming hour after the show, but right now is the world premiere of
[02:37:02.301 --> 02:37:04.832]  Texans revolt against TSA tyranny.
[02:37:05.636 --> 02:37:06.921]  Storm Capitol.
[02:37:23.260 --> 02:37:28.803]  The House votes 138 to 0 to kick a bunch of pedophiles out of our state!
[02:37:29.484 --> 02:37:34.326]  And the Senate gets down on their knees and lets their boots!
[02:37:35.107 --> 02:37:36.788]  I want to talk to you about treachery.
[02:37:37.728 --> 02:37:38.629]  About treason.
[02:37:39.761 --> 02:37:47.467]  about abuse of power and the authoritarian control grid that is destroying our Constitutional Republic.
[02:37:47.747 --> 02:37:50.269]  On May 24, 2011, the U.S.
[02:37:50.329 --> 02:38:05.501]  Attorney sent a threatening letter to the Texas Statehouse informing the Texas Senate that if they passed the bill that had been unanimously passed by the House, 138 to 0, blocking TSA from violating state and federal law,
[02:38:06.101 --> 02:38:21.469]  ...groping men, women, and children's genitals, including Miss America, who was violated in Dallas, that if they did their duty, their job, and followed common sense and the Constitution, and stopped this molestation that was going on, and is still ongoing...
[02:38:21.949 --> 02:38:32.671]  That the feds would blockade all air travel in and out of Texas, the second most populous state in the nation, with mega cities like Houston, Dallas, San Antonio.
[02:38:32.811 --> 02:38:51.254]  They said if you try to stop our TSA agents from actually sticking their hands in people's pants, not just grabbing their genitals on the outside, and running their hands down into the crease of people's rear end, I can't believe I have to talk about this in America, this extreme power grab.
[02:38:52.139 --> 02:39:00.963]  That if they tried to enforce the law in this state, that the feds would create a no-fly zone over the state of Texas.
[02:39:01.264 --> 02:39:02.624]  A blockade, an act of war.
[02:39:03.565 --> 02:39:05.466]  Well, the Texas House said, fine, we don't care.
[02:39:05.506 --> 02:39:06.306]  We passed the bill.
[02:39:06.326 --> 02:39:07.167]  We're doing the right thing.
[02:39:08.267 --> 02:39:09.208]  Don't mess with Texas.
[02:39:09.248 --> 02:39:10.448]  Let's have this confrontation.
[02:39:10.488 --> 02:39:11.329]  Let's call your bluff.
[02:39:12.469 --> 02:39:17.932]  Now, in the Senate of 31 senators in the Texas Senate, they had 30 of the 31.
[02:39:18.432 --> 02:39:19.393]  A super majority.
[02:39:20.033 --> 02:39:21.654]  Governor Perry claimed he was going to sign it.
[02:39:22.861 --> 02:39:33.293]  Well, his crony, David Dewhurst, with a long history in the CIA and coups in Latin America, Klaus Barbie the Nazi.
[02:39:33.313 --> 02:39:35.596]  I mean, you can't make stuff up like this.
[02:39:36.977 --> 02:39:37.959]  David Dewhurst.
[02:39:39.560 --> 02:39:53.808]  Under Justice Department orders, with federal lobbyists violating Texas ethics rules, went on the floor of the House and threatened the members into removing their yes vote.
[02:39:54.008 --> 02:39:55.729]  And so the bill was pulled.
[02:39:56.209 --> 02:40:07.215]  And we now know about this because of State Senator Dan Patrick of Houston going public in the San Antonio Express News, the Austin American Statesman, the Houston Chronicle and Sing.
[02:40:07.955 --> 02:40:11.638]  That Dewhurst did not want this information to get out.
[02:40:12.079 --> 02:40:28.794]  He didn't want his fingerprints on it, but everybody witnessed it, that he twisted arms and helped expand the threat of a federal blockade or a no-fly zone over Texas that the Justice Department brazenly issued, which is an act of war under international law.
[02:40:29.394 --> 02:40:31.556]  That's what they're doing to Qaddafi right now in Libya.
[02:40:31.897 --> 02:40:33.978]  They said no air traffic in or out of Texas.
[02:40:34.699 --> 02:40:43.733]  And instead of the Senate going forward and calling the feds bluff, David Dewhurst twisted arms and ensured that the bill died.
[02:40:44.274 --> 02:40:48.820]  Well, we got word of this, and there was still time to try to get the bill back on the Senate floor.
[02:40:49.989 --> 02:41:06.370]  I called spontaneously in the last hour of my radio show on Wednesday, May 25th, for folks to get in their cars, to get down to the Texas Capitol, and to go in there and to confront these federal minions that are trying by stealth
[02:41:07.211 --> 02:41:09.993]  Uh, to allow the TSA to continue their activities.
[02:41:10.313 --> 02:41:14.576]  Dewhurst did not want anyone to know that he was the one that killed this legislation.
[02:41:15.037 --> 02:41:26.905]  Not only is he for the groping and the federal domination, but he doesn't want you to know that because he understands how incredibly unpopular these TSA rape down, grope downs are.
[02:41:27.325 --> 02:41:29.827]  This is absolutely outrageous.
[02:41:30.367 --> 02:41:42.835]  And everyone needs to remember that as Dewhurst prepares to run for Kay Bailey Hutchinson's Senate seat, that we need a real constitutionalist, a real patriot, and not some corrupt rhino.
[02:41:43.996 --> 02:41:47.919]  It shows you how much the establishment Republicans love the police state.
[02:41:48.479 --> 02:41:55.444]  And they want to break the will of the American people along with their socialist communist cohorts in the Obama administration.
[02:41:56.184 --> 02:42:03.408]  David Dewhurst needs to go ahead and join with Obama and join with the neocons and stop acting like he's a patriot.
[02:42:03.989 --> 02:42:06.770]  His political career is now going down in flames.
[02:42:07.251 --> 02:42:09.512]  Many political watchers have now pointed out.
[02:42:10.432 --> 02:42:17.377]  If you think it destroyed Newt Gingrich's career as a so-called conservative to come out against Congressman Ryan's budget and call it extreme,
[02:42:18.217 --> 02:42:33.402]  If you think it's endangering Mitt Romney, that he's the author of the Massachusetts Socialist Healthcare Bill that became the federal model, if you think these rhinos are becoming an endangered species in politics, you're absolutely right.
[02:42:34.122 --> 02:42:37.243]  And Dewhurst has shown us exactly who he is.
[02:42:38.143 --> 02:42:42.605]  So he may have won this battle against Texas, but he's going to lose the war.
[02:42:43.680 --> 02:42:51.693]  Now here's what happened down at the Capitol when the people came out to let their servants know they were fully aware of the treason they were engaged in.
[02:42:53.095 --> 02:42:57.742]  Well, nice little spontaneous group of people that don't want a bunch of federal brown shirts.
[02:42:59.718 --> 02:43:04.280]  Folks, you're going to go in and tell those Senators to follow the will of a unanimous vote of the House?
[02:43:05.361 --> 02:43:06.682]  Let them block our airports.
[02:43:06.742 --> 02:43:09.723]  Let them set up a criminal federal blockade of Texas!
[02:43:10.204 --> 02:43:15.867]  It's time these foreign banks that have hijacked our state understand this is only the beginning!
[02:43:19.389 --> 02:43:23.992]  It's time I understand that control freak parasites have gone too far!
[02:43:24.012 --> 02:43:32.556]  25 states are moving to block the federal brown shirt pervert force that now is invading public schools!
[02:43:33.417 --> 02:43:37.940]  I don't need a megaphone to expose the tyranny of that cowardly Senate!
[02:43:38.600 --> 02:43:44.163]  And we'll take those House members and we'll kick out every one of those senators and we'll put them in!
[02:43:47.930 --> 02:43:48.970]  Well, everybody, let's go together.
[02:43:48.990 --> 02:43:50.290]  Let's go in and talk to them.
[02:43:50.531 --> 02:43:51.471]  That's what we're here for.
[02:43:51.491 --> 02:43:52.011]  It doesn't matter.
[02:43:52.031 --> 02:43:53.631]  We're going in there and letting them know we were there.
[02:43:54.271 --> 02:43:55.252]  Come on, let's go!
[02:43:57.212 --> 02:44:01.713]  We gotta go through their little baby pervert TSA system.
[02:44:02.593 --> 02:44:03.713]  This is how they break you.
[02:44:04.293 --> 02:44:09.054]  In two years, they'll be sticking your hands down your pants if we don't stop them at this Capitol.
[02:44:10.835 --> 02:44:12.015]  Slave entrance right here.
[02:44:14.209 --> 02:44:15.914]  It's all about making you feel like you're a criminal.
[02:44:15.934 --> 02:44:17.538]  This is the TSA right here.
[02:44:19.223 --> 02:44:22.051]  The TSA that got Muhammad Muttalib on the plane.
[02:44:23.899 --> 02:44:24.619]  Oh, oh, I gotta be searched!
[02:44:24.639 --> 02:44:25.560]  I need to be on the news as often as I can!
[02:44:25.580 --> 02:44:25.980]  GSA Brown Search!
[02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:26.420]  GSA Brown Search!
[02:44:26.440 --> 02:44:26.780]  GSA Brown Search!
[02:44:26.800 --> 02:44:27.120]  GSA Brown Search!
[02:44:27.140 --> 02:44:27.420]  Fans out!
[02:44:27.460 --> 02:44:27.721]  Fans out!
[02:44:27.741 --> 02:44:27.941]  Fans out!
[02:44:27.961 --> 02:44:28.121]  Fans out!
[02:44:28.141 --> 02:44:28.361]  Fans out!
[02:44:48.749 --> 02:44:55.074]  Government people and approved upper-level slaves only have to come in and wave their card.
[02:44:55.574 --> 02:44:58.036]  The government overlords, they get to come in.
[02:44:59.728 --> 02:45:01.529]  They're exempt from having to come through.
[02:45:02.150 --> 02:45:03.490]  And see, this is what they're planning.
[02:45:03.791 --> 02:45:10.214]  They train you to go through all this and get angry, then everybody gets one of these ID systems to be able to even come in.
[02:45:10.694 --> 02:45:12.996]  So it's a two-tiered... This is real discrimination.
[02:45:13.356 --> 02:45:15.877]  What you're witnessing right there is real... Show it, Aaron.
[02:45:16.318 --> 02:45:17.418]  That's real discrimination.
[02:45:18.139 --> 02:45:19.139]  Trusted travelers.
[02:45:19.500 --> 02:45:23.902]  That's what the hands down the pants are about, is to make you accept biometrics to be able to do anything.
[02:45:24.302 --> 02:45:28.665]  Then in the future, everybody gets the card, but then they do the groping as well.
[02:45:29.656 --> 02:45:34.530]  We have to exercise this freedom to let them know they're our servants or we will lose it!
[02:45:46.786 --> 02:45:48.347]  Let them hear you!
[02:45:48.387 --> 02:45:48.967]  We're all for freedom!
[02:46:09.642 --> 02:46:22.536]  Because in every case in history, there are always criminals that get control of government and try to train you, that they dominate you, and there's no doubt that's happening today!
[02:46:25.592 --> 02:46:29.114]  This place is infested with parasites!
[02:46:29.854 --> 02:46:33.456]  This place is infested with offshore lobbyists!
[02:46:34.617 --> 02:46:49.025]  Anyone in this Texas Senate that does not on record say they will vote to kick the feds out of here and force their blockade, call their head, is an enemy of the Republic!
[02:46:54.813 --> 02:46:56.634]  We're invading a den of iniquity.
[02:46:56.694 --> 02:46:57.975]  Uphold the Constitution!
[02:46:57.995 --> 02:47:00.036]  Support the Bill of Rights!
[02:47:00.056 --> 02:47:04.019]  Support the Bill of Rights!
[02:47:04.039 --> 02:47:07.241]  Oh, everybody else is allowed in but we're discriminated against?
[02:47:07.261 --> 02:47:08.222]  This is our capital!
[02:47:08.722 --> 02:47:09.343]  We want in!
[02:47:09.423 --> 02:47:10.383]  Crown my nose!
[02:47:10.583 --> 02:47:11.524]  Crown my nose!
[02:47:27.334 --> 02:47:32.178]  And we know they're cowards.
[02:47:32.238 --> 02:47:46.812]  The Texas House unanimously, the will of the people, told you to kick the federal perverts out of Texas and the seizure of the entire infrastructure.
[02:47:47.933 --> 02:47:57.141]  You, thanks to Curt Watson, the slime bug, have engaged in turmoil treason!
[02:47:57.422 --> 02:48:00.164]  Alex, why all the noise?
[02:48:00.685 --> 02:48:01.846]  Why all the noise?
[02:48:03.035 --> 02:48:12.479]  Unanimously, this state, the people's representatives in the House, voted to kick the TSA out who's violating every law of the sun.
[02:48:12.499 --> 02:48:13.980]  Sticking their heads down people's hats.
[02:48:14.020 --> 02:48:18.621]  Broking the silver of Invercargill's capital.
[02:48:19.282 --> 02:48:24.044]  Kirk Watson and some of the federal pimps came in here and said he'll have a federal embargo
[02:48:24.884 --> 02:48:26.986]  Like we're Libya on our aircraft.
[02:48:27.286 --> 02:48:27.666]  Good!
[02:48:28.527 --> 02:48:32.510]  Pull the scallywag New World Order trash out.
[02:48:32.791 --> 02:48:36.433]  The federal government has stolen 27 trillion dollars.
[02:48:36.754 --> 02:48:39.696]  This country's going down into a third world nation.
[02:48:40.977 --> 02:48:42.238]  And there are other states fighting.
[02:48:42.739 --> 02:48:47.603]  And if these senators don't do their job and they cower, we'll replace every one of them.
[02:48:50.549 --> 02:48:51.770]  I did the Bill of Rights.
[02:48:51.850 --> 02:48:53.370]  I pulled the Constitution.
[02:48:53.470 --> 02:48:56.792]  Uh-oh, the people are coming.
[02:48:56.832 --> 02:48:57.492]  I wish I did.
[02:48:57.532 --> 02:48:58.412]  Hey, how you guys doing?
[02:49:13.114 --> 02:49:13.414]  What's going on?
[02:49:13.434 --> 02:49:14.134]  Are you looking for somebody?
[02:49:14.194 --> 02:49:14.995]  Yeah, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:49:15.015 --> 02:49:15.555]  How are you doing?
[02:49:15.575 --> 02:49:15.855]  I'm great.
[02:49:15.875 --> 02:49:16.235]  Good to see you.
[02:49:16.295 --> 02:49:27.519]  Hey, we're just here to let the Legitimate Governor Dewhurst know that we really want them to go ahead and call the feds bluff and have them try to impose that active war blockade under international law.
[02:49:29.520 --> 02:49:32.141]  They won't let us even into the gallery or any other area.
[02:49:34.165 --> 02:49:35.186]  Would you like to show us?
[02:49:35.206 --> 02:49:35.566]  Yeah.
[02:49:35.926 --> 02:49:37.707]  Well no, they just blocked us by force.
[02:49:37.727 --> 02:49:39.888]  Kind of like the TSA sticks their hands up.
[02:49:39.928 --> 02:49:43.310]  But this is the staff office, so we thought we'd talk to you.
[02:49:43.350 --> 02:49:44.210]  So you give them a message.
[02:49:44.430 --> 02:49:44.911]  Yes sir.
[02:49:46.291 --> 02:49:51.854]  Obviously it violates federal and state law to have people groping small children or putting their fingers inside the vagina of Miss America.
[02:49:52.334 --> 02:49:53.795]  Obviously that's not freedom.
[02:49:53.835 --> 02:49:54.756]  That's North Korea.
[02:49:56.023 --> 02:49:57.785]  Uh, and she was crying after it happened.
[02:49:57.805 --> 02:50:02.870]  You've had members of the House children being groped travels down by tens of billions a year.
[02:50:02.910 --> 02:50:07.794]  The hotel associations have said, and this is a federal blockade of all major infrastructure.
[02:50:08.154 --> 02:50:10.357]  TSA is announcing under federal ruling.
[02:50:10.577 --> 02:50:14.020]  They're gonna now be overseeing proms in New Mexico and other areas.
[02:50:14.040 --> 02:50:14.721]  You heard about that?
[02:50:15.822 --> 02:50:18.304]  They've announced they're gonna be on highways, ports,
[02:50:18.963 --> 02:50:22.065]  Uh, railway stations, bus stations, they're seizing the entire infrastructure.
[02:50:22.505 --> 02:50:26.487]  The federal government has, as you know, gone into receivership to foreign offshore banks.
[02:50:26.507 --> 02:50:28.368]  Twenty-seven trillion's been stolen, according to Bloomberg.
[02:50:28.768 --> 02:50:30.369]  So this is soft martial law.
[02:50:30.769 --> 02:50:34.351]  And we want the Lieutenant Governor to understand that you have a unanimous vote in the House.
[02:50:35.206 --> 02:50:44.891]  And that in special session or today or at the soonest possible time, they need to move to go ahead and pass this and have the confrontation with the out-of-control federal government.
[02:50:45.151 --> 02:50:52.735]  Because if we'll put up with them sexually assaulting Miss America and taking the diapers off one-year-old babies, we'll put up with anything.
[02:51:01.727 --> 02:51:04.129]  Food prices are spiraling out of control.
[02:51:04.409 --> 02:51:10.554]  In order to survive, you will soon need to produce some or all of your own food in your backyard or small farm.
[02:51:10.794 --> 02:51:19.681]  Many years ago, sought-after radio guest Marjorie Wildcraft and her family began working to find the easiest ways to grow food for the crisis we are now facing.
[02:51:19.921 --> 02:51:23.686]  Marjorie created a video that is the fastest way to learn how to grow food.
[02:51:23.926 --> 02:51:31.756]  You'll learn the most efficient gardening methods, myths and truths of orchards and edible landscaping, effective predator protection, and even home butchering.
[02:51:31.896 --> 02:51:38.364]  Everyone is talking about Marjorie's DVD, and it's highly recommended by Jim Rawls, Jack Spurko, and Bountiful Gardens.
[02:51:38.604 --> 02:51:45.748]  Read her free reports on how to have a green thumb, making free fertilizer, and answers the question, do you need a gun to garden?
[02:51:45.988 --> 02:51:55.693]  If you want the security, savings, and freedom of food self-reliance, buy Marjorie's DVD and get the free reports at BackyardFoodProduction.com.
[02:51:55.914 --> 02:51:58.955]  Again, that's BackyardFoodProduction.com.
[02:52:03.604 --> 02:52:05.546]  Alex Jones here with key information.
[02:52:05.926 --> 02:52:06.426]  The U.S.
[02:52:06.506 --> 02:52:13.231]  government is a Ponzi scheme that relies on the Treasury continuously selling large amounts of government bonds to foreign central banks.
[02:52:13.792 --> 02:52:16.434]  With Japan about to become a seller of U.S.
[02:52:16.494 --> 02:52:19.756]  bonds in order to rebuild its own nation, and the U.S.
[02:52:19.836 --> 02:52:26.421]  antagonizing China by calling them currency manipulators, the Federal Reserve, which is already buying about 70% of U.S.
[02:52:26.481 --> 02:52:29.083]  Treasuries, will soon be the only buyer left of U.S.
[02:52:29.123 --> 02:52:29.584]  Treasuries.
[02:52:29.984 --> 02:52:33.447]  Our friends at the National Inflation Association believe that the U.S.
[02:52:33.487 --> 02:52:39.071]  dollar will soon become worthless and Americans will see the purchasing power of their incomes and savings destroyed.
[02:52:39.451 --> 02:52:47.437]  I strongly urge my fellow Americans to sign up for the free NIA newsletter at www.inflation.us.
[02:52:47.898 --> 02:52:57.245]  If you are sick and tired of the economic propaganda in the mainstream media, sign up for free at inflation.us to learn the economic truth that the mainstream media ignores.
[02:53:00.094 --> 02:53:02.415]  Big Berkey water filters are in high demand.
[02:53:02.615 --> 02:53:04.456]  Storable foods are also in high demand.

[02:53:09.719 --> 02:53:13.121]  But increasingly, our customers have been asking for storable foods.

[02:53:29.671 --> 02:53:38.616]  Combine our Berkey water filters, which are powerful enough to purify treated, untreated, or even stagnant pond water with our storable foods, and you have a winning combination.

[02:54:12.523 --> 02:54:13.084]  Okay, we are
[02:54:27.602 --> 02:54:28.502]  Welcome back from the break.
[02:54:28.563 --> 02:54:30.163]  Again, I'm Aaron Dykes filling in.
[02:54:30.183 --> 02:54:41.049]  If you just joined us in the middle of the last segment, that was just a few excerpts of the righteous indignation that Alex Jones and hundreds of other protesters brought to the Texas Capitol.
[02:54:42.370 --> 02:54:54.777]  One of the clips you saw Alex talking to an office aide of Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst, who became the center of the controversy of how the anti-TSA bill, just trying to check some of their powers,
[02:54:55.237 --> 02:54:56.438]  We're good to go.
[02:55:15.169 --> 02:55:19.591]  We spoke to the office of Dewhurst and he has been warned.
[02:55:20.011 --> 02:55:33.237]  Now he is being challenged by Dan Patrick, the very man who introduced the anti-TSA bill, who may now be running in the Senate race, challenging David Dewhurst after his very public tiff.
[02:55:33.317 --> 02:55:38.759]  Dan Patrick, of course, came out and explained to the public that it was Dewhurst who was behind
[02:55:39.219 --> 02:55:46.743]  The attempts to kill the TSA bill, although with an important note that Alex mentioned in the video, that he knew it was publicly unpopular.
[02:55:46.803 --> 02:55:57.448]  He knew that the people wanted the bill to pass, so he hid his tracks and used his connections in the Texas Senate to get the bill killed without having his, quote, fingerprints on it.
[02:55:57.808 --> 02:56:04.491]  So it'll be very interesting to see if Dan Patrick, who ostensibly was trying to pass a very patriotic bill in the Texas
[02:56:05.111 --> 02:56:05.651]  I think so.
[02:56:26.626 --> 02:56:32.649]  It's very interesting clips, and it's just a short segment of the whole adventure we had at the Capitol two days ago.
[02:56:33.249 --> 02:56:37.471]  And protesters are still at the Capitol today trying to hold the Texas Senate accountable.
[02:56:38.112 --> 02:56:46.636]  But this is a nationwide struggle, so you should get down to your state capitol, to your legislators, and let them know you want this kind of legislation passed and you don't.
[02:56:47.496 --> 02:57:04.771]  One, the TSA's threats of shutting down air traffic or any other kind of martial law threats to keep anyone from reasonable legislation restricting the TSA, upholding the Fourth Amendment and just putting some common sense into not groping men, women and children just to board traffic.
[02:57:09.405 --> 02:57:16.570]  We are almost out of time, but again we have Senator Rand Paul slams GOP for blocking efforts to amend the Patriot Act.
[02:57:16.610 --> 02:57:26.098]  He was the quote lone wolf trying to get some reasonable restrictions on the government power through the Patriot Act to look up gun information.
[02:57:26.938 --> 02:57:29.680]  And we have Obama signing the Patriot Act extensions.
[02:57:29.700 --> 02:57:41.347]  We have Obama breaking his promise to veto the worldwide bill, which is in the defense authorization, which has a continuous war against an unnamed enemy with unlimited funding for all time.
[02:57:41.387 --> 02:57:42.908]  It's really just creeping tyranny.
[02:57:43.508 --> 02:57:44.910]  As our economy breaks down.
[02:57:45.791 --> 02:57:47.052]  Wonderful time to be alive.
[02:57:47.072 --> 02:57:48.373]  Scary time to be alive.
[02:57:48.734 --> 02:57:50.516]  I've never seen people more active.
[02:57:50.576 --> 02:57:54.099]  It is the time to get active because the tyranny isn't going to stop.
[02:57:54.139 --> 02:58:01.487]  And as Bob Barr said yesterday, if we don't clamp down on the Fourth Amendment violations now, we never will be able to.
[02:58:02.168 --> 02:58:03.289]  Most likely for sure.
[02:58:06.707 --> 02:58:17.197]  We are going to have rebroadcast in just a minute with Paul Watson and Mike Adams and Alex Jones video confronting the TSA bill at the State Capitol.
[02:58:17.277 --> 02:58:20.300]  Rebroadcast at the end of this transmission.
