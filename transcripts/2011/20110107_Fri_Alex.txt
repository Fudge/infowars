[00:00:04.731 --> 00:00:05.372]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.032 --> 00:00:07.073]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.813 --> 00:00:09.094]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.554 --> 00:00:10.394]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.155 --> 00:00:12.155]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.716 --> 00:00:16.318]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.898 --> 00:00:20.960]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.353 --> 00:00:37.534]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:38.135 --> 00:00:40.356]  Again, thank you for joining us.
[00:00:40.436 --> 00:00:49.201]  Coming up in an hour and a half, on this live Friday edition, we're going to have Charlotte Iserby popping back in.
[00:00:49.261 --> 00:00:57.045]  Hadn't had her on in over a year and a half, and this will be our third visit with her in the last two months, because at the end of the show, when she was on with us,
[00:00:58.146 --> 00:01:07.394]  Early last week, she wanted to get into the Democratic and Republican parties and how they're infiltrated and controlled by different management groups.
[00:01:08.295 --> 00:01:15.220]  And she wanted to get into an organization I've heard a lot about over the years, the CNP.
[00:01:16.681 --> 00:01:26.727]  And so we'll get more details from her coming up on that and how she believes they're infiltrating and controlling the Republican Party, not just the Democratic Party.
[00:01:26.747 --> 00:01:32.790]  So that's a 30-minute interview so we could get into that subject that she brought up at the end of the show.
[00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.452]  And then, of course, our once-a-week visit with Bob Chapman.
[00:01:36.892 --> 00:01:38.353]  We're going to have open phones today.
[00:01:38.894 --> 00:01:42.736]  Completely wide open phones, interspersed with really important news.
[00:01:43.936 --> 00:01:54.063]  Uh, in fact, I've promised all week to really get in to the surveillance police state grid, and then I had my stack sitting here, and I guess somebody cleaned my desk off nicely.
[00:01:54.083 --> 00:01:58.066]  Uh, I appreciate that, but will you guys dig out that big police state stack I had?
[00:01:59.747 --> 00:02:10.673]  You'll see a bunch of New York Times articles about smart cameras watching everyone, or about how almost all digital cameras and cell phones stamp date and location on the photos you're taking.
[00:02:11.133 --> 00:02:18.778]  All the major printer companies for decades put micro-printing on it, where the printer was bought, and so they can track it back to you.
[00:02:19.138 --> 00:02:20.199]  Just total control.
[00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:22.000]  Guilty until proven innocent.
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.383]  But then everything this government does, they want to keep that and make that
[00:02:28.383 --> 00:02:31.345]  A major, major secret show.
[00:02:31.385 --> 00:02:43.851]  That is all coming up because I keep saying I'm going to get to that big stack of new news dealing with the infrared body heat resonance ID biometric satellites that they launched in the name of fighting global warming.
[00:02:43.871 --> 00:02:46.052]  Now, of course, it comes out that's all a complete fraud.
[00:02:46.912 --> 00:02:49.654]  Also, Paul Joseph Watson
[00:02:51.260 --> 00:03:00.666]  Wrote two big stories yesterday dealing with prison cities, called for for a long time by the Club of Rome, United Nations, CIA and others.
[00:03:00.706 --> 00:03:05.930]  This is the global prison system where the entire world is a prison.
[00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:18.739]  And they're getting the younger generations ready with the public schools, the hospitals now operating like prisons, guilty until proven innocent, surveilling you, getting intel on you, trying to frame you, not letting you know that you're in law enforcement.
[00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:21.360]  situation when the nurse is talking to you.
[00:03:23.541 --> 00:03:30.283]  There's a whole bunch of different prominent world leaders including an IPCC leader of the UN.
[00:03:32.084 --> 00:03:35.885]  Another one Watson's discovered, there's so many, he lists a whole bunch in this new article.
[00:03:36.526 --> 00:03:47.850]  IPCC professor and head of Report 3 and 4, some of the latest reports, calls for elite warrior leadership to rule over eco-dictatorship.
[00:03:48.866 --> 00:03:53.607]  A total police state where the SWAT teams will be the environmental priest.
[00:03:54.288 --> 00:03:55.508]  This has always been their plan.
[00:03:56.468 --> 00:03:58.109]  And of course, they say they don't believe in God.
[00:03:58.149 --> 00:04:00.249]  He says, just you want a God, we're going to give you one.
[00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.391]  And the God is the state and the state will deliver the carrot and the stick.
[00:04:05.451 --> 00:04:11.893]  And everything will be ruled by green police in black uniforms with submachine guns.
[00:04:12.053 --> 00:04:14.554]  I mean, actual UN reports.
[00:04:14.634 --> 00:04:16.434]  I mean, this is... Watson has it.
[00:04:16.454 --> 00:04:18.055]  I mean, you cannot make this stuff up.
[00:04:19.142 --> 00:04:20.043]  That's what blows me away.
[00:04:20.063 --> 00:04:21.264]  This is such a nightmare.
[00:04:21.744 --> 00:04:28.890]  And I remember 16 years ago learning about the Earth First Battalion set up by the Pentagon.
[00:04:30.931 --> 00:04:36.496]  And the weird chants they had the special forces do about, we are the white horse death, we come to kill.
[00:04:36.856 --> 00:04:39.778]  We come to kill those that hurt and defile our mother Earth.
[00:04:39.818 --> 00:04:41.340]  We are the Earth First Battalion.
[00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:42.521]  We come to bring blood.
[00:04:42.561 --> 00:04:43.461]  We come to bring death.
[00:04:43.802 --> 00:04:45.243]  Oh, white horse, oh, white horse.
[00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:47.769]  I mean, this is official.
[00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.431]  Tex Mars has got a copy of the Internal Earth First Battalion.
[00:04:51.691 --> 00:04:52.972]  That's not Earth First, the group.
[00:04:53.232 --> 00:04:54.712]  They're kind of named after that.
[00:04:55.553 --> 00:04:58.394]  But it's all coming, so get ready.
[00:04:58.414 --> 00:04:59.074]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:00.074 --> 00:05:01.195]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:05:01.235 --> 00:05:07.918]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:05:08.178 --> 00:05:10.459]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:15.901]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family
[00:05:16.101 --> 00:05:18.883]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:05:19.143 --> 00:05:21.244]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:05:21.464 --> 00:05:27.387]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:05:27.707 --> 00:05:30.909]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:36.612]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:05:36.872 --> 00:05:38.173]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:05:38.513 --> 00:05:39.674]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:05:39.814 --> 00:05:42.355]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:05:42.475 --> 00:05:43.896]  He explains everything you need to know.
[00:05:44.156 --> 00:05:46.517]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:05:46.697 --> 00:05:51.198]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:05:51.318 --> 00:05:53.759]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:57.600]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:58.781]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:06:00.441 --> 00:06:03.044]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:06:03.444 --> 00:06:08.409]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:06:08.769 --> 00:06:10.511]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:06:10.831 --> 00:06:15.636]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:06:15.836 --> 00:06:16.797]  How much do you want?
[00:06:17.018 --> 00:06:17.758]  When do you want it?
[00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:19.740]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.861]  When will you need it?
[00:06:21.102 --> 00:06:23.164]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:06:23.304 --> 00:06:24.345]  Will there be any food?
[00:06:24.625 --> 00:06:28.526]  Will it make your children sick if there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself?
[00:06:28.686 --> 00:06:31.207]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:06:31.407 --> 00:06:34.588]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:06:35.008 --> 00:06:38.509]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:06:38.809 --> 00:06:39.810]  How much will you need?
[00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:40.670]  We don't know.
[00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:41.870]  How much do you want?
[00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:42.771]  All you can get.
[00:06:42.791 --> 00:06:43.771]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:06:44.071 --> 00:06:46.832]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:06:47.132 --> 00:06:49.753]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:06:49.953 --> 00:06:50.733]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:03.623]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:07:03.923 --> 00:07:04.523]  Number 1.
[00:07:04.843 --> 00:07:08.005]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:07:08.266 --> 00:07:08.826]  Number 2.
[00:07:09.126 --> 00:07:13.689]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:14.470]  It's true.
[00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:19.333]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:07:19.633 --> 00:07:20.173]  Number 3.
[00:07:20.453 --> 00:07:23.755]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:07:24.056 --> 00:07:27.758]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:28.499]  Number 4.
[00:07:28.739 --> 00:07:31.101]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:07:31.501 --> 00:07:34.885]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:07:35.185 --> 00:07:35.725]  Number 5.
[00:07:35.986 --> 00:07:39.909]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:07:40.129 --> 00:07:44.894]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:07:45.174 --> 00:07:49.198]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:49.338 --> 00:07:50.899]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:51.119 --> 00:07:53.221]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:07:53.381 --> 00:07:55.984]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:07:56.224 --> 00:08:02.790]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.133]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:16.016 --> 00:08:39.709]  Well, there is almost no establishment corporate media news on the Maryland attacks of yesterday, and almost all of the news stories about it now have Maryland stage terror theories develop after package explosions here on Friday, January 7th, 2011.
[00:08:42.861 --> 00:09:04.126]  There is almost no coverage of this and we know in Maryland they tried to set up this Martinez character and that even came out in places like Salon, Headline, FBI and Trap Baltimore Bomb Plot Suspect No Way Antonio Martinez Could Have Assembled the Phony Bomb Intended to Blow Up Recruitment Centers, Defense Says.
[00:09:04.446 --> 00:09:09.987]  That was just back on December 13th of last year, less than a month ago.
[00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:20.080]  And we saw the same thing in Oregon and many, many other states in the last few months with these provocative actions.
[00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:23.664]  It isn't the FBI infiltrating already operating groups.
[00:09:24.084 --> 00:09:31.492]  They go out and find low-grade morons, converts to Islam, people that are always, you know, posing with their wife.
[00:09:32.153 --> 00:09:39.118]  You know, in an Islamic outfit with guns, acting cartoonish, buffoonish, right out of central casting.
[00:09:39.719 --> 00:09:41.320]  Same thing with Viper Militia.
[00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:54.470]  When I saw some of their members, the way they were shooting videos, the way they shot them, I went on air seven months before it happened, out of 400 plus known militias, and I said, that group's infiltrated by feds, and they're getting ready to set them up.
[00:09:56.209 --> 00:09:57.189]  The Hattari Militia.
[00:10:19.031 --> 00:10:23.876]  I pointed out on air that they had clearly been infiltrated and on air warned them.
[00:10:24.416 --> 00:10:27.559]  And even had pale horse on.
[00:10:27.599 --> 00:10:29.561]  Of course, another allusion to death.
[00:10:30.282 --> 00:10:32.564]  And basically asked him, are you a fed?
[00:10:32.584 --> 00:10:33.645]  Because you sure act like one.
[00:10:33.665 --> 00:10:34.626]  You sure look like one.
[00:10:34.646 --> 00:10:36.247]  Right out of Central Casting.
[00:10:37.248 --> 00:10:42.311]  And I don't know if he's a Fed or not, or was being manipulated by the Fed, but it's still sealed.
[00:10:42.352 --> 00:10:46.394]  They ordered the Hatari released, of course, months after they'd been set up and lied about.
[00:10:46.734 --> 00:10:51.437]  And it came out that they did have an FBI informant and agent in the group of less than 14.
[00:10:52.618 --> 00:10:54.419]  And we still don't know who those agents are.
[00:10:55.460 --> 00:11:05.587]  Or who recorded the leader of Hatari simply saying, yeah, if the whole country collapses and they send in, you know, UN troops to take our guns, we'll have to fight back.
[00:11:06.561 --> 00:11:09.622]  Well, I mean, I've said on air that I'm not going to a FEMA camp.
[00:11:09.662 --> 00:11:11.803]  I've said on air I would fight foreign occupation.
[00:11:12.463 --> 00:11:13.524]  I mean, who wouldn't?
[00:11:14.104 --> 00:11:23.368]  Whether you were Japanese, Chinese, Russian, British, Canadian, American, Mexican, Iraqi, for that matter.
[00:11:25.885 --> 00:11:29.709]  We, day one, came out and said, this is a stage, this is a setup, release them.
[00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:40.979]  And I said, of course, we fingered this group as clearly being manipulated by the statements and things coming out, and that probably those making the statements were the informants.
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.162]  And then a strange thing happened in Michigan.
[00:11:44.783 --> 00:11:49.507]  Some of the militia groups, obviously infiltrated and led by feds,
[00:11:50.868 --> 00:11:56.376]  got completely angry and said how dare Alex Jones say Atari's been infiltrated.
[00:11:57.218 --> 00:11:58.179]  This is before it happened.
[00:11:58.199 --> 00:12:01.183]  Then once they got set up, how dare him say they've been infiltrated.
[00:12:01.624 --> 00:12:04.368]  Alex is saying all militias are feds and militias are bad.
[00:12:04.829 --> 00:12:05.610]  That's a straw man.
[00:12:06.499 --> 00:12:06.559]  Yes.
[00:12:25.137 --> 00:12:27.819]  Even before it happened, not just when it happened.
[00:12:27.879 --> 00:12:36.105]  I said they were set up and it was all a fraud and then it was confirmed that that was the case and the judge ordered them released and you know the case is now blown to bits.
[00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:47.458]  Because it was all a massive fraud and then people will say again that I'm saying all militias are bad or that all militias are run by feds.
[00:12:47.538 --> 00:13:02.268]  No, I said there are infiltrators and anybody who tries to deny that, anyone who tries to imply that that is not the case, that's like saying the sun doesn't affect weather on the planet, like the UN says.
[00:13:02.288 --> 00:13:05.131]  I mean, it's just on its face comical.
[00:13:06.151 --> 00:13:07.612]  There are other classic straw men.
[00:13:07.632 --> 00:13:10.134]  I don't know why I'm going down this rabbit trail, but it's always informative.
[00:13:11.254 --> 00:13:23.702]  Whatever rabbit trail we go down, that people put out the straw man that I supported the flotilla attack that Israel did on that aid ship when we decried it and criticized it ad nauseum.
[00:13:24.703 --> 00:13:28.465]  Or that I said that if you criticize Israel, you're mentally ill and bad.
[00:13:28.945 --> 00:13:29.626]  Never said that.
[00:13:31.022 --> 00:13:37.547]  People that attack me with that, ineffectively of course, unless low-grade morons are fooled by it, but that's their lot in life.
[00:13:37.587 --> 00:13:38.388]  I'm sad for them.
[00:13:38.708 --> 00:13:40.450]  They weren't gifted with any intellect.
[00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:46.975]  The very videos they use is where I say, I don't say you're an idiot if you criticize Israel.
[00:13:47.415 --> 00:13:54.842]  I say you're an idiot if you say that I work for Israel, or that I work for the Vatican, or the Masons, or anybody else.
[00:13:56.653 --> 00:13:57.813]  So that's how people operate.
[00:13:58.434 --> 00:14:02.955]  And you've got to know, in most of these cases, these people are bought and paid for.
[00:14:03.955 --> 00:14:16.079]  I mean, more and more I analyze it and look at it, the tactics I see are exactly what confirmed feds do, and exactly what the mainstream media does with straw man operations.
[00:14:16.459 --> 00:14:22.361]  But the way I went down that rabbit trail was pointing out that you're going to see more and more staged attacks.
[00:14:22.641 --> 00:14:24.262]  But if
[00:14:26.158 --> 00:14:30.333]  The staged attack has too many whistleblowers on the inside.
[00:14:30.654 --> 00:14:31.838]  They will pull back from it.
[00:14:32.972 --> 00:14:34.113]  And then we'll stop hyping it.
[00:14:34.573 --> 00:14:47.140]  And that's the real mark of this, what we see going on in Maryland with the two packages that blew up at state offices that were being sorted on their way reportedly to the governor's office.
[00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:52.162]  We're now seeing almost no news on this, and they're not hyping it and fear-mongering.
[00:14:52.643 --> 00:14:54.804]  Now that means one of two things.
[00:14:55.684 --> 00:15:01.908]  It could be a few other things, but two big things that the probability studies and research shows
[00:15:03.538 --> 00:15:06.319]  90% chance it's one of those two things, just to give you a dead reckoning number.
[00:15:08.039 --> 00:15:16.040]  A, these were real terror attacks, because the rule of thumb is, real terror attacks are not hyped, are not promoted.
[00:15:18.401 --> 00:15:29.643]  Or, they had provocateurs in there running this, and a good FBI agent or state police or others have recorded it and have tried to release it.
[00:15:31.477 --> 00:15:40.302]  And we saw that in 93 with the first World Trade Center attack, where their own informant knew they were setting him up, so he recorded the FBI telling him, no, go ahead with the bombing.
[00:15:40.503 --> 00:15:41.743]  Well, you said it was going to be inert.
[00:15:41.783 --> 00:15:42.784]  Then you said build a real one.
[00:15:43.164 --> 00:15:44.625]  Then you said a fake detonator.
[00:15:44.665 --> 00:15:45.646]  Now it's a real detonator.
[00:15:45.846 --> 00:15:47.007]  Now you're going to go ahead with it?
[00:15:47.167 --> 00:15:47.347]  No!
[00:15:50.512 --> 00:16:07.030]  And then that guy, the day it happened, came out with the tapes, did a press conference, and it hit CBS News, New York Times, and a bunch of other news, and the Feds just totally backed off, and just, you heard nothing about World Trade Center attack after that, and they went on to start Waco as a smokescreen for it a few months later.
[00:16:09.172 --> 00:16:10.374]  Again, I've studied these people.
[00:16:10.474 --> 00:16:11.515]  I know how they operate.
[00:16:16.713 --> 00:16:20.255]  And so this whole Maryland situation is very, very suspicious.
[00:16:20.835 --> 00:16:22.075]  Obviously, we'll continue to watch it.
[00:16:22.396 --> 00:16:27.478]  Now, I'll tell you what else is suspicious in this larger equation.
[00:16:28.979 --> 00:16:38.123]  And that is, murdered Bush aide was an expert in chemical, biological, and cyber warfare, had highest security clearances.
[00:16:38.643 --> 00:16:40.484]  I mean, this guy ran everything.
[00:16:41.577 --> 00:16:42.759]  Maryland D.C.
[00:16:42.999 --> 00:16:43.560]  Amtrak.
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.464]  Chairman, CEO, Mothers of Drunk Driving.
[00:16:46.824 --> 00:16:48.687]  Chairman, Vietnam Veterans Memorial.
[00:16:49.047 --> 00:16:51.991]  President, CEO, Vietnam Children's Fund.
[00:16:52.492 --> 00:16:54.194]  I mean, I don't have an hour to read all this.
[00:16:55.453 --> 00:17:21.583]  uh... west point special ops from day one in the early sixties or mid-sixties assigned uh... to the defense secretary you know harvard cambridge uh... systems analyst that's ran corporation strategic programs office of secretary of defense i mean this is this is right out of west point sixty seven everything
[00:17:23.905 --> 00:17:27.188]  He ran the nuclear Nike Hercules missile sites.
[00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:31.011]  This guy was a master gopher.
[00:17:31.512 --> 00:17:32.673]  He was a super class.
[00:17:33.213 --> 00:17:37.938]  He was part of the 6,000 super gophers and they killed him deader than a hammer.
[00:17:39.679 --> 00:17:50.069]  In fact, going over this, it looks like he might be in the top 1,000 gophers or even more.
[00:17:51.295 --> 00:17:53.296]  One of those quiet guys you really don't hear a lot about.
[00:17:53.416 --> 00:17:57.078]  Murdered Bush aide was expert in chemical, biological and cyber warfare.
[00:17:57.098 --> 00:17:58.799]  Had highest security clearances.
[00:17:59.059 --> 00:18:00.319]  This is from Cryptome.org.
[00:18:00.619 --> 00:18:04.941]  We've got it up at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and they've got a good boil down here.
[00:18:04.961 --> 00:18:07.963]  I mean, but this guy is just the master spook.
[00:18:08.783 --> 00:18:13.667]  And then now he's running around a shovel with a shoe off and no coat and freezing weather for two days.
[00:18:15.148 --> 00:18:19.131]  And then he's found dead in a landfill.
[00:18:19.551 --> 00:18:25.436]  And they've had people, even on Fox News, experts... Let me pull up the quote here.
[00:18:27.927 --> 00:18:28.448]  We're good.
[00:18:45.601 --> 00:18:52.147]  The Delaware police and others are behaving like he's bad and he was going to firebomb his neighbor.
[00:18:52.167 --> 00:18:58.033]  I mean, you've got this super spook with his hands in everything, a master controller.
[00:18:58.894 --> 00:19:04.335]  Show that people like George Bush and Bill Clinton and people could go off and, you know, play golf.
[00:19:04.655 --> 00:19:07.476]  This is a guy in the command seat at many levels.
[00:19:07.856 --> 00:19:10.797]  I mean, he's just got his fingers in literally everything.
[00:19:11.817 --> 00:19:16.118]  The pedigree of a super Rand Corporation operative here.
[00:19:20.139 --> 00:19:24.160]  And it's got mind control written all over it.
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:27.181]  Again, just like the underwear bomber.
[00:19:28.314 --> 00:19:30.558]  Disheveled, looked drugged, out of it.
[00:19:30.638 --> 00:19:34.084]  Sharp-dressed man gets him on the plane without his passport.
[00:19:35.149 --> 00:19:35.910]  That was security.
[00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:36.690]  A security head.
[00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:41.173]  Who else can tell the people in Amsterdam, get back, and they're arguing?
[00:19:41.213 --> 00:19:41.413]  Nope.
[00:19:41.553 --> 00:19:42.474]  I said he goes on.
[00:19:42.854 --> 00:19:44.875]  Then he goes on, tries to blow his underwear up.
[00:19:45.216 --> 00:19:48.618]  We have the witnesses on board the plane that are our listeners.
[00:19:48.898 --> 00:19:49.979]  They tell everybody this.
[00:19:50.199 --> 00:19:51.560]  The media tries to lie about it.
[00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:56.503]  And then months later it comes out, yeah, the State Department was ordered by an unnamed intelligence agency to get him on the plane.
[00:19:56.843 --> 00:19:58.024]  I mean, it's the same thing with this.
[00:20:00.945 --> 00:20:02.807]  Not all protein supplements are created equal.
[00:20:03.207 --> 00:20:11.795]  One World Whey is the first cold-temperature-processed, 100% all-natural, unrefined, bioactive, grass-pasture-raised, milk-whey protein.
[00:20:12.195 --> 00:20:24.907]  Far from being another ordinary protein supplement, One World Whey is a full-spectrum nutrition power food in and of itself, providing overall life-building benefits that touch virtually every human's life that other protein supplements don't deliver on.
[00:20:25.347 --> 00:20:26.167]  What are the benefits?
[00:20:26.528 --> 00:20:39.013]  Boosts the immune system, anti-aging properties, helps detoxification, helps reduce body fat, excellent for building lean muscle, increases energy levels, enhances the feelings of youth, sports performance, exercise recovery.
[00:20:39.553 --> 00:20:40.094]  Who's it for?
[00:20:40.494 --> 00:20:49.538]  Busy people, hard-working executives, students, teachers, active seniors, people recovering from illness, office workers, construction workers, and high-performance athletes.
[00:20:49.998 --> 00:20:51.643]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit oneworldway.com.
[00:20:51.723 --> 00:20:52.746]  That's oneworld, W-H-E-Y dot com.
[00:21:01.201 --> 00:21:04.824]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:21:05.225 --> 00:21:08.228]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:21:08.468 --> 00:21:13.252]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:21:13.272 --> 00:21:19.518]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:21:19.658 --> 00:21:21.901]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:21:22.421 --> 00:21:22.721]  Tim Geithner?
[00:21:22.741 --> 00:21:23.162]  Bernanke?
[00:21:23.242 --> 00:21:24.022]  They're arsonists!
[00:21:24.042 --> 00:21:25.183]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:21:25.203 --> 00:21:27.444]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:21:41.334 --> 00:21:45.258]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[00:21:45.719 --> 00:21:48.262]  we have seen a fall of the republic.

[00:23:54.953 --> 00:23:57.154]  The next generation of alternative smoking.
[00:24:11.468 --> 00:24:17.990]  Okay, I said I was going to take a lot of calls, and I'm already burning up valuable time just covering a few articles, but they're all so important.
[00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:22.531]  And again, this story from Cryptome.org is up on InfoWars.com if you want to go over it.
[00:24:22.551 --> 00:24:34.234]  It is long and lengthy, dealing with the Bush aide, John Jack Wheeler, inside a Williamton office building the day before he died.
[00:24:35.055 --> 00:24:38.216]  Bizarre final days and hours of John P. Wheeler III.
[00:24:39.836 --> 00:24:43.639]  And the retired Major General saying it had to be a professional hit.
[00:24:44.199 --> 00:24:48.042]  The police claiming he was planting bombs in his neighbor's house.
[00:24:49.624 --> 00:24:50.684]  Just totally crazy.
[00:24:51.693 --> 00:24:53.815]  And then we get all these other reports now.
[00:24:53.955 --> 00:24:58.520]  In Maryland, two incendiary packages caused security scare across Maryland.
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.302]  It was a tense afternoon across the region.
[00:25:01.322 --> 00:25:06.747]  There were two packages, one addressed to Governor Martin O'Malley, ignited inside two state office buildings.
[00:25:07.088 --> 00:25:12.493]  They showed up 20 miles apart, one in Hanover, another in Annapolis, just a few feet from the Statehouse.
[00:25:16.069 --> 00:25:17.610]  And they just don't have more information.
[00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:20.953]  They're not hyping it, which is very, very suspicious.
[00:25:20.973 --> 00:25:27.718]  Because when they stage something, they hype the living daylights out of it, unless they know their staged event has been compromised.
[00:25:27.758 --> 00:25:30.580]  I mean, when you see a staged event, they're ready in minutes.
[00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:36.785]  Minutes after the underwear bomber on Christmas Day, Chertoff was on the news saying, I got body scanners for you.
[00:25:37.445 --> 00:25:38.066]  We're lucky.
[00:25:39.147 --> 00:25:42.109]  And Janet Napolitano, oh, we're going to order these today.
[00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:43.410]  They ordered them a year before.
[00:25:43.751 --> 00:25:45.172]  Takes time to build them, get them in place.
[00:25:45.472 --> 00:25:46.973]  Oh, we're putting these in just because of this.
[00:25:48.255 --> 00:25:50.837]  Just like 40,000 U.S.
[00:25:50.877 --> 00:25:54.520]  troops, 18,000 British troops, mashing in and around Afghanistan.
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:55.801]  Two carrier attack fleets.
[00:25:56.221 --> 00:26:02.287]  Bush, according to Newsweek, signs the attack order to go after Afghanistan in the next week on September 10th.
[00:26:04.025 --> 00:26:11.091]  Has Jeb Bush, according to Associated Press, declared martial law in Florida September 9th, but not publicly issue it.
[00:26:11.371 --> 00:26:14.874]  They planned on probably taking out the Capitol and going into full bore martial law.
[00:26:15.394 --> 00:26:29.586]  But the happy hooligans out of the Dakotas assigned to Virginia that day did not follow orders and fired two AIM-9s, according to our insiders, and later a lot of this did leak, into the flight over Pennsylvania.
[00:26:31.269 --> 00:26:33.351]  Some speculate it was going at Building 7 though.
[00:26:33.991 --> 00:26:38.014]  That's why they had to go ahead and blow it up later in the day regardless, because it was wired and ready.
[00:26:38.514 --> 00:26:42.377]  Here's some of the other crazy news I will get to after I take a bunch of your calls.
[00:26:42.717 --> 00:26:44.618]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:26:44.638 --> 00:26:44.678]  800-259-9231.
[00:26:53.171 --> 00:26:57.034]  The websites again are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:26:57.774 --> 00:27:02.417]  Also, if you have any questions, you can go to Twitter.com forward slash TheRealAlexJones.
[00:27:03.018 --> 00:27:05.319]  I will cover a few of your Twitter questions today.
[00:27:05.339 --> 00:27:08.421]  I always enjoy seeing those.
[00:27:09.522 --> 00:27:12.324]  But the toll-free number up at Genesis
[00:27:12.884 --> 00:27:16.528]  That is in Minnesota, and then they pipe the calls down here to Austin, Texas, is 800-259-9231.
[00:27:16.548 --> 00:27:16.588]  800-259-9231.
[00:27:16.608 --> 00:27:20.954]  That is for anybody, long-time, first-time callers, people that disagree, agree, whatever issue you want to cover today.
[00:27:29.963 --> 00:27:36.525]  But I've been noticing a degrading in the sound quality on the Sunday show phone calls.
[00:27:37.105 --> 00:27:39.205]  And it's also that people have worse and worse cell phones.
[00:27:39.725 --> 00:27:46.167]  But also we noticed that we think the quality is going down on the cheap 1-800 service we have that's inexpensive.
[00:27:46.847 --> 00:27:54.189]  And I only take calls in my studio on Sundays generally, and I've just noticed the calls aren't as clean as when we take them on our local 512 number.
[00:27:55.989 --> 00:28:00.732]  And so we're moving away from that number and testing a few new numbers here today.
[00:28:01.033 --> 00:28:03.214]  And so this will be a first-time caller line.
[00:28:03.654 --> 00:28:05.075]  First-time caller line.
[00:28:05.376 --> 00:28:09.458]  We're testing this new phone line system out today.
[00:28:09.798 --> 00:28:11.340]  This will be for first-time caller line.
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:11.740]  877-789-ALEX.
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:12.800]  That's easy to remember.
[00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:14.382]  877-789-A-L-E-X for yours truly.
[00:28:14.402 --> 00:28:14.802]  877-789-A-L-E-X.
[00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:30.454]  And we will take your calls, your first-time calls.
[00:28:30.734 --> 00:28:33.476]  So it's wide open phones on the 800-259-9231 number and it is first-time callers on 877-789-2539.
[00:28:33.496 --> 00:28:35.458]  Now here's some of the other amazing, and when I say amazing,
[00:28:46.548 --> 00:28:48.631]  Give me a document cam shot of this, it's so important.
[00:28:49.091 --> 00:28:56.300]  This is the Associated Press, also MSNBC reporting the same thing, Reuters, you name it.
[00:28:56.961 --> 00:28:59.805]  And this is a major cave-in by these people.
[00:29:00.265 --> 00:29:05.252]  A major, major, major cave-in by them.
[00:29:07.534 --> 00:29:09.235]  In fact, I could talk three hours just about this.
[00:29:09.996 --> 00:29:15.341]  Too much fluoride in water, government says.
[00:29:15.941 --> 00:29:18.083]  High levels causing spots on teeth.
[00:29:18.624 --> 00:29:21.046]  Recommended limit to be lowered.
[00:29:21.626 --> 00:29:22.227]  Whoa!
[00:29:23.147 --> 00:29:24.188]  Whoa!
[00:29:25.309 --> 00:29:27.771]  This is so big!
[00:29:29.693 --> 00:29:32.255]  I'll briefly get into this when we come back, but I'm getting back into it later.
[00:29:33.296 --> 00:29:34.057]  And then we've got
[00:29:35.882 --> 00:29:36.843]  The good, the bad, and the ugly.
[00:29:36.863 --> 00:29:37.203]  We've got it.
[00:29:37.263 --> 00:29:38.644]  I mean, there is so much news.
[00:29:38.704 --> 00:29:40.706]  I've somehow got to get to it all today, but also take your calls.
[00:29:41.126 --> 00:29:42.287]  Your call straight ahead.
[00:29:42.307 --> 00:29:43.628]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:44.369 --> 00:29:48.192]  It is Friday, the seventh day of the new year.
[00:29:50.393 --> 00:29:51.274]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.774 --> 00:29:53.376]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.316 --> 00:29:56.999]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:59.858 --> 00:32:02.461]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:32:02.882 --> 00:32:07.849]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:32:08.209 --> 00:32:09.931]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:32:10.252 --> 00:32:15.078]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:32:15.258 --> 00:32:16.219]  How much do you want?
[00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:17.181]  When do you want it?
[00:32:17.541 --> 00:32:19.142]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:32:19.422 --> 00:32:20.262]  When will you need it?
[00:32:20.502 --> 00:32:22.563]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:32:22.703 --> 00:32:23.803]  Will there be any food?
[00:32:24.043 --> 00:32:25.384]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:32:25.564 --> 00:32:30.645]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:32:30.846 --> 00:32:34.007]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:32:34.427 --> 00:32:37.888]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:32:38.248 --> 00:32:39.229]  How much will you need?
[00:32:39.469 --> 00:32:40.089]  We don't know.
[00:32:40.369 --> 00:32:41.270]  How much do you want?
[00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:42.210]  All you can get.
[00:32:42.411 --> 00:32:43.251]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:32:43.491 --> 00:32:46.253]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:32:46.553 --> 00:32:49.655]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:32:49.675 --> 00:32:50.595]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:32:59.588 --> 00:33:00.128]  We've got it.
[00:33:00.169 --> 00:33:06.614]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:33:06.714 --> 00:33:08.795]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:11.077 --> 00:33:20.605]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:33:22.286 --> 00:33:27.671]  It is Friday, seventh day of the new year.
[00:33:27.771 --> 00:33:28.752]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:33:30.419 --> 00:33:32.340]  How to do justice to this article.
[00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:34.980]  Too much fluoride in water, government says.
[00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:36.701]  High levels causing spots on teeth.
[00:33:37.241 --> 00:33:38.661]  Recommended limit to be lowered.
[00:33:39.582 --> 00:33:40.702]  This is really old news.
[00:33:41.262 --> 00:33:54.046]  Six years ago, the American Dental Association was forced, because of just the hundreds and hundreds of confirmed studies, to start telling parents to not have their under six-year-olds brush their teeth with fluoride toothpaste.
[00:33:54.066 --> 00:33:57.647]  Of course, you still go to the store and it's fluoride toothpaste for kids everywhere.
[00:33:58.867 --> 00:34:04.049]  Because it is causing massive dental fluorosis and also fracturing of the teeth.
[00:34:04.689 --> 00:34:08.330]  Now all the other major studies also show at least a doubling in bone cancer.
[00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:10.731]  In boys it can be even higher for some reason.
[00:34:12.691 --> 00:34:22.014]  It also shows early onset of heart disease because it starts a calcification process of the arteries and veins but mainly arteries.
[00:34:22.954 --> 00:34:24.375]  It also of course
[00:34:26.638 --> 00:34:28.660]  Retards growth, reduces IQ.
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:30.261]  I mean the list goes on and on.
[00:34:30.642 --> 00:34:36.287]  And they know that it causes an earlier onset of different types of arthritis.
[00:34:36.567 --> 00:34:38.108]  Massive calcification.
[00:34:38.148 --> 00:34:40.250]  Most of it precipitates out in the bones.
[00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:41.351]  And that's not Alex Jones.
[00:34:41.391 --> 00:34:47.016]  That's medical doctors, brain surgeons, top toxicologists, endocrinologists.
[00:34:48.217 --> 00:34:49.118]  Bone doctors.
[00:34:49.198 --> 00:34:50.858]  I mean, I've had them all on.
[00:34:51.499 --> 00:35:12.527]  Over 90% in 2000, and then in 2005, of the union members, toxicologists, doctors and others working for the EPA, and then another action, the FDA, have sent letters to Congress and testified that it's total deadly poison.
[00:35:14.378 --> 00:35:19.927]  And just earlier last year, these same groups came out and said, please take it out.
[00:35:20.328 --> 00:35:23.352]  The cancer increases is an absolute fact.
[00:35:24.073 --> 00:35:24.534]  Take it out.
[00:35:25.075 --> 00:35:27.138]  And their answer is just to laugh at everybody.
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:30.621]  Ho ho!
[00:35:31.121 --> 00:35:32.622]  Marge, did you hear that?
[00:35:33.122 --> 00:35:35.024]  They said sodium fluoride isn't good for us.
[00:35:35.384 --> 00:35:51.417]  And then if that doesn't freak you out, in the rocks that they get most of the sodium fluoride from, the phosphate mines, where they get the phosphate for the fertilizer, this is the byproduct that they're not allowed under law, though they violate that as well, to dump on the crops.
[00:35:53.131 --> 00:35:55.313]  They allow you to put it on grass, grass fertilizer.
[00:35:55.333 --> 00:35:57.835]  You ever get grass fertilizer that says, don't use for food crops?
[00:35:58.235 --> 00:35:59.696]  That's because it's what they're putting in your water.
[00:36:00.217 --> 00:36:01.117]  Basically the same thing.
[00:36:02.138 --> 00:36:07.863]  And it's got mercury, lead, radium, uranium, a whole bunch of other types of isotopes.
[00:36:08.643 --> 00:36:09.604]  And you drink that!
[00:36:09.624 --> 00:36:10.765]  Okay?
[00:36:10.945 --> 00:36:14.188]  They're putting everything you can imagine in your water.
[00:36:14.248 --> 00:36:15.169]  It's not just fluoride.
[00:36:15.209 --> 00:36:16.009]  That's the cover name.
[00:36:16.069 --> 00:36:17.971]  It's the biggest, sickest joke.
[00:36:19.261 --> 00:36:46.093]  You know, I was just reading some more big mainline studies out of a major medical center, one up in Dallas, major universities, just yesterday, where they've known for decades that high fructose corn syrup, in the first five years of life, when you're forming your brain and so many other things, also it decides how many fat cells you get, and it gears the fat cells, and so that's another reason I've done studies on countries where people eat
[00:36:46.713 --> 00:36:50.916]  Just as unhealthy overall calorie diets as Americans, but they're not as overweight.
[00:36:51.377 --> 00:37:01.885]  Because when you drink all this and eat all this high fructose corn syrup, and now look at the baby formulas, most of them are over half high fructose corn syrup, it literally grows your fat cells.
[00:37:01.945 --> 00:37:03.086]  It supercharges them.
[00:37:04.987 --> 00:37:06.208]  It supercharges them.
[00:37:07.949 --> 00:37:08.890]  Now, I said I'd take your call.
[00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:13.173]  See, I'm already going off down another rabbit trail, but you know this information.
[00:37:13.534 --> 00:37:15.035]  You want to warn people
[00:37:17.262 --> 00:37:18.523]  And it's just incredible.
[00:37:19.804 --> 00:37:21.065]  It's absolutely amazing.
[00:37:21.826 --> 00:37:25.568]  And then there's the other issues of how they grow the corn.
[00:37:25.949 --> 00:37:27.990]  How they do spray the toxic fertilizer on it.
[00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:39.959]  And so that's why they found right at half of major corn syrup products, that's Washington Post, three years ago, you can pull up that headline, major study, of corn syrup products have high levels of lead in them.
[00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:43.061]  Also, lower numbers have mercury.
[00:37:43.081 --> 00:37:45.142]  You can just pull that up for yourself right now.
[00:37:45.562 --> 00:37:46.622]  Corn syrup, lead.
[00:37:46.822 --> 00:37:47.843]  Corn syrup, mercury.
[00:37:48.083 --> 00:37:49.083]  So there's also that.
[00:37:49.143 --> 00:37:51.244]  It's also getting toxic waste in it.
[00:37:51.865 --> 00:37:56.407]  See, they take the byproducts of the oil industry, all the stuff they can't get rid of.
[00:37:56.427 --> 00:37:57.747]  That's why I do want to get away from oil.
[00:37:58.207 --> 00:37:59.088]  Oh, oil's not good.
[00:38:01.035 --> 00:38:07.979]  It's allowed us to do so much of what we've done, and it's a wonder product out of the earth, but it's not good what they do to the toxic waste.
[00:38:08.599 --> 00:38:15.984]  And it's not good to be using billions of barrels a month globally of it, because they take all the stuff they can't use from the crude oil, and they put it into distillates.
[00:38:16.304 --> 00:38:23.088]  The products, the hair care products, the soaps, the water, just everything, and it's toxic!
[00:38:24.328 --> 00:38:25.049]  It's toxic!
[00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:30.152]  They don't want to have to store that or get rid of it, so they make it a product!
[00:38:31.633 --> 00:38:32.694]  They make it a product.
[00:38:33.214 --> 00:38:35.335]  And then you say, well, why would they do something cold-blooded like that?
[00:38:35.375 --> 00:38:36.296]  It's not just profit.
[00:38:37.077 --> 00:38:39.258]  It's eugenics, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:39.758 --> 00:38:40.279]  It's sick.
[00:38:40.579 --> 00:38:49.445]  They could at least dump it in the ocean, and then, sure, you'd get it back in the food chain through the fish, but not as bad as putting it directly into your water.
[00:38:50.706 --> 00:38:51.846]  So what an incredible article.
[00:38:51.946 --> 00:38:58.631]  I'll cover that exclusively a little bit in the next hour, because I want to go over all this properly.
[00:39:00.523 --> 00:39:05.105]  Well, what they don't tell you here is they're recommending lowering it from 0.7 to 1.2.
[00:39:05.225 --> 00:39:12.069]  Yeah, that's the standard now, 0.7 part per million, as high as 1.2.
[00:39:12.749 --> 00:39:13.570]  Some places in the U.S.
[00:39:13.610 --> 00:39:13.750]  have 0.4.
[00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:18.192]  I mean, you do 0.1, massive IQ reduction.
[00:39:18.832 --> 00:39:27.337]  Imagine three times that or four times that, to lowering it to an even lower level because you're getting too much in the toothpaste and in the water, even according to them.
[00:39:27.557 --> 00:39:29.258]  Well, what about all the foods they add it to?
[00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:32.154]  I mean, do you know what they put in the food?
[00:39:32.856 --> 00:39:35.763]  Sometimes they've got hundreds of times this in the food.
[00:39:36.023 --> 00:39:38.589]  I mean, that's why the public is a bunch of brain-damaged zombies.
[00:39:38.830 --> 00:39:40.032]  You wonder why Americans can't...
[00:39:41.616 --> 00:39:43.677]  Get excited, or get upset, or get motivated?
[00:39:43.918 --> 00:39:44.878]  Why we're so obese?
[00:39:45.058 --> 00:39:47.720]  Why there's record numbers of women with thyroid dysfunction?
[00:39:48.001 --> 00:39:50.302]  Every time, fluoride, fluoride, fluoride, fluoride.
[00:39:50.462 --> 00:39:52.023]  That's mainline medical literature!
[00:39:52.704 --> 00:39:58.168]  I can't go to the gym, or be in a restaurant, or listen to women on talk radio, or talk to women I know.
[00:39:58.188 --> 00:40:01.410]  25, 30, 40 years old, hair falling out.
[00:40:01.710 --> 00:40:02.271]  Thyroid.
[00:40:05.128 --> 00:40:07.971]  For some reason, and I've had medical doctors on, they've gone over the reasons.
[00:40:08.372 --> 00:40:09.113]  I don't understand it.
[00:40:09.593 --> 00:40:11.896]  Women absorb it more to their thyroid than men.
[00:40:12.597 --> 00:40:14.499]  Some things hurt men worse than it hurts women.
[00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:16.341]  Some things hurt women worse than it hurts men.
[00:40:16.602 --> 00:40:18.064]  I mean, this is devastating us!
[00:40:18.784 --> 00:40:20.166]  And here we know that
[00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:25.201]  Even the American Dental Association covered their hind end quietly!
[00:40:25.581 --> 00:40:30.222]  They still have the fluoride for the kids in schools and push it, but they did put a little proviso in.
[00:40:30.282 --> 00:40:31.962]  Oh, by the way, we have a recommendation.
[00:40:31.982 --> 00:40:34.923]  If you can find it hidden, officially don't do this.
[00:40:35.223 --> 00:40:36.523]  But here, here kids, take it.
[00:40:36.743 --> 00:40:37.023]  Take it.
[00:40:37.223 --> 00:40:37.483]  Take it.
[00:40:37.643 --> 00:40:44.845]  Because the phosphate industry and the rest of them, and the coal industry and the rest of them, are just funding all of this.
[00:40:46.905 --> 00:40:47.485]  Okay, I'm done.
[00:40:47.605 --> 00:40:48.425]  I said I'd take your calls.
[00:40:49.245 --> 00:40:51.386]  We're going to go to the Genesis phone system.
[00:40:53.403 --> 00:40:58.606]  Here in just a moment, suddenly my mouse, my wireless mouse is not working.
[00:40:59.346 --> 00:41:04.469]  So I guess I'll have to go to the Genesis phone system because that's the only phone system I can see up in front of me.
[00:41:04.709 --> 00:41:11.393]  And then we'll test out after the break when I'm able to get this working, our phone system with the first-time callers.
[00:41:12.554 --> 00:41:17.356]  Let's go ahead and take a phone call from Chuck in Oklahoma.
[00:41:17.396 --> 00:41:18.237]  Chuck, you're on the air.
[00:41:19.483 --> 00:41:20.483]  Alex, how's it going, man?
[00:41:20.523 --> 00:41:22.084]  I sure appreciate what you're doing for us all.
[00:41:22.364 --> 00:41:23.064]  I appreciate you.
[00:41:23.124 --> 00:41:26.565]  I'm very excited that I'm starting to see some sanity.
[00:41:26.985 --> 00:41:29.285]  The government's now saying too much fluoride in water.
[00:41:29.625 --> 00:41:31.606]  They don't tell you also in food and toothpaste.
[00:41:32.026 --> 00:41:36.247]  And Google violates laws the police are saying all over the world.
[00:41:36.327 --> 00:41:38.647]  So we're starting to see a little positive movement here.
[00:41:38.687 --> 00:41:39.048]  Go ahead.
[00:41:39.748 --> 00:41:42.328]  You know, I think it's about time we start seeing a little positive movement.
[00:41:42.568 --> 00:41:44.969]  And I just don't even know how it even came to this.
[00:41:45.089 --> 00:41:45.329]  I mean,
[00:41:46.078 --> 00:41:51.703]  The idea of it all putting fluoride into our water, I mean, they try to say, oh, it's helped to keep our teeth white or whatever.
[00:41:52.023 --> 00:41:54.145]  I mean, I thought that's why we had dental insurance.
[00:41:54.205 --> 00:41:57.968]  I thought that's why we went and paid, you know, our $20 copays to get our teeth white.
[00:41:57.988 --> 00:42:01.711]  Well, the government doesn't care about corn syrup and things that they know are really bad.
[00:42:01.951 --> 00:42:03.192]  They don't care about our safety.
[00:42:03.232 --> 00:42:06.454]  It's all about the excuse to force things into our body.
[00:42:06.675 --> 00:42:07.655]  And now they admit that.
[00:42:07.916 --> 00:42:10.518]  They're saying, oh, we want to put statins in the drugs for kids.
[00:42:10.858 --> 00:42:14.141]  We want to put statins in the water and lithium in the water.
[00:42:14.301 --> 00:42:15.642]  I mean, we can see what they're doing.
[00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:16.870]  Yeah.
[00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:18.671]  I think it's just absolutely crazy.
[00:42:18.711 --> 00:42:20.452]  I don't even know how it's even come to this.
[00:42:20.532 --> 00:42:29.897]  I mean, I think it's a really ballsy move just by the government and everybody that's trying to... Well, here's another chutzpah-filled move came out this week.
[00:42:30.377 --> 00:42:31.598]  EPA leaked documents.
[00:42:31.638 --> 00:42:36.140]  They knew this pesticide was wiping bees out, and they said, go ahead and use it, but don't tell anybody.
[00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:43.824]  They know they're killing the Earth, but then they give us fake ways to help the Earth so they get more power.
[00:42:45.287 --> 00:42:50.033]  I mean, we've got birds falling out of the sky, we've got green algae falling on people in China.
[00:42:50.133 --> 00:42:52.436]  I mean, what are they exactly trying to do?
[00:42:52.596 --> 00:43:00.145]  I mean, do they not think that... They've now had thousands of doves die with green dripping out of their beaks in Italy.
[00:43:01.326 --> 00:43:02.268]  Yeah, I mean...
[00:43:03.033 --> 00:43:10.759]  And what kind of, you know, gets me thinking a little bit is, you know, you see how they can actually control, you know, volcanoes erupting and stuff like that.
[00:43:10.819 --> 00:43:15.323]  You know, a lot of these things that happen, you know, with killing a lot of wildlife that I notice is
[00:43:15.945 --> 00:43:24.127]  Around volcanoes when a lot of these, you know, poisonous gases infuse, fumigate from whatever these volcanoes and a lot of wildlife starts dying off.
[00:43:24.848 --> 00:43:45.394]  Well, there is a big fault line where all these birds are dying over by Arkansas and that area where four states come together, but there's no active volcanoes or off-gassing going on and they now are trying to officially say that fireworks made 5,000 birds fly into each other and liquefy their insides, which is completely impossible and insane.
[00:43:46.598 --> 00:43:46.778]  Yeah.
[00:43:47.198 --> 00:43:48.539]  That is completely insane.
[00:43:48.579 --> 00:43:52.141]  I think the last thing a bird would do as soon as they see fireworks would probably go the opposite way.
[00:43:52.161 --> 00:43:57.624]  Well, I mean, if birds ran into each other, I've seen birds fly in to glass windows on houses.
[00:43:57.904 --> 00:43:59.305]  They're not pulverized inside.
[00:43:59.685 --> 00:44:00.285]  Break their neck.
[00:44:00.646 --> 00:44:03.727]  I've shot hundreds of birds with a shotgun and eaten them.
[00:44:04.107 --> 00:44:04.688]  And let me tell you,
[00:44:05.919 --> 00:44:07.180]  In fact, I got emails about this.
[00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:09.742]  Folks that haven't dove or quail hunted don't know this.
[00:44:10.082 --> 00:44:11.884]  You can butcher them in about 10 seconds.
[00:44:12.464 --> 00:44:29.538]  The only meat that's good on them, maybe with bigger quail, their legs, but all you do is just reach in and rip the breast right off, pull the feathers off in about another 10 seconds, and have a plastic baggie with the marinade sauce that you're going to baste it in.
[00:44:29.778 --> 00:44:32.200]  You throw it under the bag while you're out hunting for a few hours.
[00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:34.822]  When you get back to the house, it's ready to cook.
[00:44:35.923 --> 00:44:38.526]  I'll assure you, folks, I've shot birds with shotguns.
[00:44:38.827 --> 00:44:39.948]  They're not polarized.
[00:44:40.228 --> 00:44:44.953]  The BBs shoot little, clean holes through them, and there's almost no blood.
[00:44:45.925 --> 00:44:48.447]  Maybe their lungs will pump a little bit of blood up.
[00:44:48.727 --> 00:44:50.828]  There'll be a little drop of blood coming out their beak.
[00:44:51.208 --> 00:44:51.668]  That's it.
[00:44:51.989 --> 00:44:54.270]  I've shot hundreds and hundreds of birds.
[00:44:54.490 --> 00:44:56.071]  My dad's probably shot thousands.
[00:44:57.452 --> 00:44:59.793]  Anybody who's been bird hunting knows this.
[00:45:00.193 --> 00:45:01.514]  It is ridiculous.
[00:45:01.594 --> 00:45:02.915]  I appreciate your call.
[00:45:02.935 --> 00:45:03.975]  Good to hear from you, Chuck.
[00:45:04.616 --> 00:45:08.918]  Let's take a phone call off our new phone line system and test it out.
[00:45:09.198 --> 00:45:11.220]  Let's talk to RJ in Texas.
[00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:12.240]  RJ, you're on the air.
[00:45:12.801 --> 00:45:13.621]  Alex, what's up, buddy?
[00:45:13.961 --> 00:45:14.241]  Good.
[00:45:14.341 --> 00:45:14.962]  Good to hear from you.
[00:45:15.472 --> 00:45:16.052]  Good, how you doing?
[00:45:16.792 --> 00:45:23.554]  Real quick, anyway, I just moved here to Austin, and I don't really want to put any more money in the banksters' hands.
[00:45:23.634 --> 00:45:25.774]  I was wondering if you could recommend a good local bank.
[00:45:29.535 --> 00:45:31.176]  Could I recommend what specifically?
[00:45:31.736 --> 00:45:32.776]  A good local bank.
[00:45:33.156 --> 00:45:35.377]  Small bank, you know, not in control of the banksters.
[00:45:35.477 --> 00:45:36.417]  Sorry, I was distracted.
[00:45:36.437 --> 00:45:38.958]  They were fixing some equipment in here and had the door open and I couldn't hear you.
[00:45:40.805 --> 00:45:47.510]  I'd have to research local banks myself in your area, RJ.
[00:45:47.570 --> 00:45:57.797]  You know, I don't really like to give people financial advice, because even if it looks like good advice today, you know, the bank might go under tomorrow, even if it's got some great local rating.
[00:45:58.157 --> 00:46:02.921]  But you can pull up, type in Texas, you know, top Texas rated banks.
[00:46:03.721 --> 00:46:10.784]  And you'll see which ones have the biggest reserves, which ones are rated having the best customer service, and I would look at a wide range.
[00:46:11.525 --> 00:46:22.930]  I personally think, you know, old local credit unions are great, things like that, but I mean, I specifically, RJ, don't like to give people, you know, individual advice.
[00:46:24.446 --> 00:46:25.526]  I was just trying to look.
[00:46:26.047 --> 00:46:27.587]  Anyway, can I get a plug for my site?
[00:46:28.087 --> 00:46:28.667]  Sure, go ahead.
[00:46:29.127 --> 00:46:31.728]  WanderingGlassStudio.com Alright, RJ.
[00:46:31.828 --> 00:46:32.548]  Good to hear from you.
[00:46:32.908 --> 00:46:34.709]  Let's talk to Josh in Ohio.
[00:46:34.769 --> 00:46:35.669]  Josh, you're on the air.
[00:46:36.930 --> 00:46:37.570]  Hey, Alex.
[00:46:37.690 --> 00:46:39.090]  It's a pleasure to talk to you.
[00:46:39.370 --> 00:46:40.130]  Good to talk to you, sir.
[00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:40.791]  What's on your mind?
[00:46:42.071 --> 00:46:51.954]  Well, actually, I just wanted to kind of touch base with you and let you know here in Ohio, I've been speaking with people for about the last 10 years.
[00:46:53.183 --> 00:46:59.245]  And you know, when I first started out, everybody just laughed at me left and right.
[00:46:59.265 --> 00:47:09.568]  And, you know, lately, I talked to a lot of people at my job, you know, and even interact with different aspects of the government and police and whatnot.
[00:47:11.425 --> 00:47:15.726]  I'll tell you, a lot of people are really starting to wake up and they're starting to notice.
[00:47:15.927 --> 00:47:34.193]  Well, you know, that's one of my biggest frustrations is that I know people are waking up en masse because I'm well known and I go out on the street and so I can get kind of my own poll in different parts of the country and world on what number of people are awake and involved.
[00:47:34.933 --> 00:47:40.475]  And I mean, it's got to be 20% of people in Austin I walk by now come up to me.
[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:42.741]  I mean, or more sometimes.
[00:47:43.121 --> 00:47:46.224]  I mean, I can almost not even get through the day and function sometimes.
[00:47:46.664 --> 00:47:51.088]  So many people, I'll be walking my dog or walking with my kids around the neighborhood, cars are stopping.
[00:47:52.068 --> 00:47:54.590]  Other parts of the country, 10% probably stop.
[00:47:55.411 --> 00:47:58.954]  Other parts of the world now, 10% come over.
[00:47:59.494 --> 00:48:01.816]  I mean, it's getting really ridiculous.
[00:48:03.738 --> 00:48:07.221]  Imagine how many other people are awake, but just leave me alone.
[00:48:07.821 --> 00:48:11.524]  Or know about the New World Order, but don't know who I am.
[00:48:11.584 --> 00:48:14.026]  I mean, it's incredible.
[00:48:14.986 --> 00:48:29.116]  And my frustration is, though, people who aren't prominent, who aren't on TV and radio and doing all these interviews and things like I am, or who aren't in films, including some Hollywood films I've been in, or the really awesome films, major film releases,
[00:48:30.357 --> 00:48:32.159]  They don't have that interaction.
[00:48:32.239 --> 00:48:34.881]  That's why we sell the t-shirts.
[00:48:34.921 --> 00:48:35.742]  It's all symbiotic.
[00:48:35.802 --> 00:48:40.466]  It funds the operation, but it's also wearing your colors, getting out of the fear.
[00:48:41.427 --> 00:48:50.594]  I mean, and if you don't want to wear an AlexJonesInfoWars.com shirt, go buy a Ron Paul shirt or a Campaign for Liberty.
[00:48:51.095 --> 00:48:53.417]  I mean, you will be mobbed
[00:48:53.957 --> 00:48:54.057]  Yes.
[00:49:14.264 --> 00:49:16.365]  Dinner bought for them, drinks bought for them.
[00:49:16.765 --> 00:49:26.951]  I mean, we need to have this community and it doesn't mean, you know, that we're all even on the same page except that we want more liberty and know we're going in the wrong direction.
[00:49:27.231 --> 00:49:30.633]  I mean, it is crazy, Josh, how awake people are getting.
[00:49:32.291 --> 00:49:46.077]  It's really exciting and I think you really hit it on the head there when you said that we just need to interact more and people need to stop being so afraid to express their opinions and just come together more.
[00:49:46.097 --> 00:49:51.340]  Like you said, if we disagree, then we can agree to disagree.
[00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:53.741]  So it's exciting, I think.
[00:49:56.784 --> 00:49:57.404]  Absolutely.
[00:49:57.484 --> 00:50:01.445]  Folks, you can experience what I experience, at least to some level.
[00:50:01.485 --> 00:50:05.166]  People will still be more timid if you're wearing a t-shirt because they don't know who you are.
[00:50:05.446 --> 00:50:08.587]  People feel like they really know me because they spend... I guess you do.
[00:50:08.607 --> 00:50:14.328]  I mean, you spend more time with me if you're a regular listener than I probably spend with my wife and children a lot of days.
[00:50:15.308 --> 00:50:16.248]  And so you do know me.
[00:50:16.608 --> 00:50:19.829]  And so people come up as if they know me because they do.
[00:50:21.249 --> 00:50:22.669]  But you'll have, I'd say, 30% of what I get
[00:50:25.954 --> 00:50:26.855]  That's a dead reckoning.
[00:50:26.875 --> 00:50:28.517]  20, 30, I don't know, maybe more.
[00:50:28.858 --> 00:50:31.601]  If you're wearing a bold Infowars.com shirt.
[00:50:31.941 --> 00:50:33.643]  I mean, I want you to experience this, folks.
[00:50:34.693 --> 00:50:39.337]  In fact, we should probably put out a Ron Paul 2012 t-shirt and promote it.
[00:50:39.437 --> 00:50:42.640]  You know, Draft Ron Paul 2012, so folks can get that going.
[00:50:43.241 --> 00:50:44.322]  In fact, I'm going to announce it now.
[00:50:44.382 --> 00:50:45.283]  I'm going to have it designed today.
[00:50:45.323 --> 00:50:46.244]  It'll be up by tomorrow.
[00:50:46.444 --> 00:50:47.385]  In a few weeks, they'll be in.
[00:50:47.405 --> 00:50:50.007]  We're going to put out a Draft Ron Paul 2012 shirt.
[00:50:50.608 --> 00:50:51.629]  And that's another good thing.
[00:50:51.669 --> 00:50:52.329]  Wear your colors.
[00:50:52.349 --> 00:50:52.930]  Wear them loud.
[00:50:52.970 --> 00:50:53.891]  Wear them proud, folks.
[00:50:53.911 --> 00:50:58.195]  That's how we take the Republic back, is identifying ourselves as being on the team for liberty.

[00:51:58.297 --> 00:52:02.120]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:04.402]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:52:04.522 --> 00:52:07.305]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:07.745 --> 00:52:12.489]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:12.849 --> 00:52:17.033]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:17.353 --> 00:52:19.674]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:19.694 --> 00:52:22.215]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:22.235 --> 00:52:25.156]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:25.497 --> 00:52:33.100]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:33.433 --> 00:52:38.676]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:38.816 --> 00:52:41.098]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:41.678 --> 00:52:45.100]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:46.261]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:46.421 --> 00:52:47.742]  You're everyone else.
[00:52:47.762 --> 00:52:48.742]  Invisible Empire.

[00:52:58.919 --> 00:53:00.180]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:05.584]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:53:05.804 --> 00:53:10.448]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:53:10.828 --> 00:53:11.228]  It's true.
[00:53:11.308 --> 00:53:15.872]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:53:16.392 --> 00:53:21.097]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:53:21.618 --> 00:53:28.545]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:53:28.746 --> 00:53:29.647]  And here's the best part.
[00:53:29.867 --> 00:53:36.234]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:53:36.434 --> 00:53:36.834]  Day after day
[00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:18.113]  Let's continue with your phone calls.
[00:54:18.153 --> 00:54:21.254]  Let's take a call off of the Genesis phone lines.
[00:54:21.634 --> 00:54:27.537]  Then we'll go back to the first-time callers that called 877-789-ALEX, the new number we're testing out today.
[00:54:28.317 --> 00:54:30.358]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chuck in Oklahoma.
[00:54:30.378 --> 00:54:30.858]  You're on the air.
[00:54:30.919 --> 00:54:31.739]  Thanks for holding, Chuck.
[00:54:34.141 --> 00:54:34.981]  Oh, we already talked to Chuck.
[00:54:35.001 --> 00:54:35.441]  That's right.
[00:54:35.521 --> 00:54:36.561]  Jonathan in Kansas.
[00:54:36.601 --> 00:54:37.002]  Go ahead.
[00:54:38.302 --> 00:54:39.022]  Yes, Alex.
[00:54:39.362 --> 00:54:42.042]  There's three big stories I have for you.
[00:54:42.623 --> 00:54:44.883]  And one of them is on YouTube now.
[00:54:44.943 --> 00:54:49.204]  It was a clip taken off of Anderson Cooper's show.
[00:54:49.944 --> 00:54:54.905]  And it's called 5200 Pentagon Employees Purchase Child Pornography.
[00:54:55.585 --> 00:54:57.005]  And it's big.
[00:54:57.305 --> 00:55:00.406]  And Anderson Cooper was saying that nobody was getting charged.
[00:55:00.886 --> 00:55:01.746]  Nobody was talking.
[00:55:02.552 --> 00:55:24.459]  uh... was going to get in trouble about it and you can type in fifty two hundred pentagon employees just that well i remember that came out uh... that comes out all the time i have to tell you i'm very suspicious of all of that uh... because trillions have been stolen from the pentagon so there's a process now uh... of trying to blackmail lower-level people
[00:55:25.479 --> 00:55:25.679]  I don't
[00:55:47.981 --> 00:55:57.927]  You know, they'll just claim that something's going on and that nothing's being done and then that's held over the Pentagon personnel's head and then they can claim, oh, this was on your network.
[00:55:58.567 --> 00:56:10.955]  It was also in the news yesterday that the government is telling all federal employees to spy on each other, you know, to make sure that everyone's loyal and that people aren't giving stuff to WikiLeaks.
[00:56:11.195 --> 00:56:14.677]  So they're just using this as a secret police system
[00:56:15.557 --> 00:56:23.202]  So as above so below, as the ancients would say, it's just as governments become more criminal, they start spying on everybody.
[00:56:23.562 --> 00:56:27.004]  And it's not good for anyone, but the tiny, tiny elite at the top.
[00:56:27.764 --> 00:56:31.046]  So I will check out that Anderson Cooper video.
[00:56:31.066 --> 00:56:31.867]  What's the other news?
[00:56:33.168 --> 00:56:37.530]  That there's a new mass grave that was found in Austria a few days ago.
[00:56:37.550 --> 00:56:40.292]  And you can just type into Google News
[00:56:41.244 --> 00:56:44.166]  Australian mass grave, and that's the first thing that comes up.
[00:56:44.506 --> 00:56:58.553]  And the last thing I have to say is that China released its new pictures of its new stealth fighter, and it looks nearly identical to the F-22 Raptor, so I'm thinking that Lockheed Martin might have sold some of the technology.
[00:56:58.573 --> 00:57:00.174]  They absolutely.
[00:57:00.234 --> 00:57:03.236]  Laurel Hughes in the mid-90s with Clinton.
[00:57:04.216 --> 00:57:09.341]  And that's why the Republicans wouldn't go after Clinton for anything truly substantive.
[00:57:09.361 --> 00:57:13.484]  They had to go after him for sex, because that was compartmentalized to only Clinton.
[00:57:14.005 --> 00:57:23.293]  See, politicians can't ever persecute each other or go on witch hunts against each other for political gain on any real issue, because they're all involved in it, or the leadership is.
[00:57:23.633 --> 00:57:24.794]  They've all got their hands dirty.
[00:57:25.791 --> 00:57:39.561]  So Ken Starr and others were linked to the Chinese sellout and then that little ruse where the surveillance AWAC got forced down in China when Bush first got in office and then the crew didn't
[00:57:40.475 --> 00:57:41.236]  PUNCH THE BUTTON!
[00:57:57.199 --> 00:57:58.320]  I have seen the reports.
[00:57:58.380 --> 00:58:02.124]  I have seen the new Chinese fighter, and it's a complete knockoff.
[00:58:02.665 --> 00:58:04.307]  Now, there's somebody else who may have sold it.
[00:58:04.587 --> 00:58:07.430]  You know who the number one culprit of selling U.S.
[00:58:07.490 --> 00:58:13.316]  secrets to China predominantly, but also to the Saudi Arabians and Russians?
[00:58:13.636 --> 00:58:18.682]  You know who's been caught over and over again giving all our secrets to other countries, and that's Israel.
[00:58:19.778 --> 00:58:24.182]  I mean, you can just type in Israel transfers technology, U.S.
[00:58:24.543 --> 00:58:25.363]  technology to China.
[00:58:25.604 --> 00:58:26.444]  I mean, it's constant.
[00:58:27.445 --> 00:58:30.188]  So, it's all crooked as a barrel of snakes.
[00:58:30.709 --> 00:58:31.409]  Any other articles?
[00:58:31.429 --> 00:58:32.911]  You always call them the good stuff, Jonathan.
[00:58:34.042 --> 00:58:39.245]  Yeah, uh, well I just wanted to say Yuri Vesmanov revealed that Ford actually built... Stay there!
[00:58:39.266 --> 00:58:39.586]  Stay there!
[00:59:04.222 --> 00:59:06.843]  We're American and be proud.
[00:59:06.863 --> 00:59:10.744]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[00:59:31.709 --> 00:59:49.242]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[00:59:52.945 --> 00:59:54.906]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.347 --> 00:59:58.129]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:04.741 --> 01:00:08.923]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.584 --> 01:00:10.384]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.164 --> 01:00:12.085]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.705 --> 01:00:16.307]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.907 --> 01:00:20.970]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:26.656 --> 01:00:31.677]  If he just joined us, I'm going to continue to take calls from about 15 after.
[01:00:31.697 --> 01:00:37.858]  And then I'm going to plunge into the news, including some incredibly positive news.
[01:00:39.238 --> 01:00:41.619]  The government now admitting that fluoride is really hurting people.
[01:00:42.359 --> 01:00:43.499]  This is just incredible.
[01:00:44.199 --> 01:00:46.079]  But that's because we forced their hand.
[01:00:46.099 --> 01:00:49.120]  The vast majority of government scientists are on record.
[01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:51.020]  And they always say the same thing.
[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:52.541]  I didn't believe it until I looked at it.
[01:00:52.581 --> 01:00:53.141]  It's deadly.
[01:00:53.221 --> 01:00:54.281]  I can't believe they did this.
[01:00:55.951 --> 01:00:57.573]  So incredible, that's coming up.
[01:00:57.974 --> 01:01:02.640]  Jonathan in Kansas, you were finishing up a point with news items that you were raising for us.
[01:01:03.902 --> 01:01:09.169]  Yes, well I wanted to say that Yuri Bezmenov in the 80s revealed that Ford
[01:01:09.742 --> 01:01:15.989]  Actually built trucks in actual factories for military trucks in the Soviet Union.
[01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:17.611]  Yeah, that was Arm and Hammer and others.
[01:01:17.651 --> 01:01:24.079]  Look, Ford, General Motors, right through World War II were making money off the German machine.
[01:01:24.099 --> 01:01:25.480]  That was in congressional hearings.
[01:01:26.682 --> 01:01:29.565]  Our Ford trucks, Chevy trucks, paid for.
[01:01:30.706 --> 01:01:31.187]  With U.S.
[01:01:31.227 --> 01:01:33.628]  tax money, we're built in Russia.
[01:01:34.149 --> 01:01:39.313]  They got money through their Opel division at GM and through the Ford division in Russia.
[01:01:39.333 --> 01:01:39.953]  I forget the name.
[01:01:40.374 --> 01:01:43.476]  We were fighting our own equipment the entire time in Vietnam.
[01:01:43.877 --> 01:01:47.640]  It's called full-spectrum dominance, and the Rand Corporation and others have explained this.
[01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:51.183]  To fully dominate, you've got to fill every space.
[01:01:51.763 --> 01:01:54.045]  And so, they believe in full-spectrum dominance.
[01:01:54.065 --> 01:01:57.829]  Full-spectrum dominance doesn't just mean land, air, sea, controlling your mind.
[01:01:58.289 --> 01:02:01.512]  It means creating and financing the Muslim extremists.
[01:02:01.872 --> 01:02:04.034]  Creating and financing the Nazis.
[01:02:04.474 --> 01:02:06.676]  Creating and financing communism.
[01:02:07.357 --> 01:02:09.079]  This is why they're so hard to beat.
[01:02:09.679 --> 01:02:15.784]  Because they will create a false political hologram with unlimited central banking funding.
[01:02:16.124 --> 01:02:19.406]  They have unlimited money because we accept it out of fraud.
[01:02:19.907 --> 01:02:23.789]  It's a magician's trick, but once you buy into it, that's why they're so hard to beat.
[01:02:24.370 --> 01:02:28.833]  Once you're aware of it though, but I mean, I'm not familiar with the guy you mentioned.
[01:02:29.294 --> 01:02:31.235]  That stuff's all in congressional hearings.
[01:02:32.596 --> 01:02:34.938]  That all came out with Anthony Sutton's research.
[01:02:35.598 --> 01:02:37.780]  I mean, that is all very well documented.
[01:02:39.574 --> 01:02:49.592]  Yeah, and well, I also wanted to tell you that this UFC fighter got a visit by the Secret Service because he criticized Obama.
[01:02:49.632 --> 01:02:51.715]  He said, well, he didn't agree with the
[01:02:52.498 --> 01:02:55.999]  The guy clearly said, I'd like to face him in the ring.
[01:03:14.423 --> 01:03:31.983]  Well, I mean, if Obama wanted to go join UFC, they're always talking about what a great basketball player he is and how he could play in the NBA, and then Barclay came out and said that, you know, the guy was a joke and he'd completely game him, you know, even though, quote, I'm a fat man, as Barclay said.
[01:03:32.003 --> 01:03:34.585]  I mean, are they going to get a Secret Service visit there?
[01:03:34.626 --> 01:03:35.366]  This is a sport.
[01:03:36.027 --> 01:03:41.010]  You know, they wear gloves, and that's the end of it.
[01:03:42.010 --> 01:03:47.774]  And statistically, they've had time to look at it now over the last two decades, the sport developing, it's less dangerous than boxing.
[01:03:47.794 --> 01:03:51.636]  Because with boxing, you've got high-powered men, but they're wearing gloves.
[01:03:52.156 --> 01:03:56.539]  And so, it goes on a lot longer, and it's the concussion that damages the brainstem.
[01:03:57.751 --> 01:04:02.875]  In UFC, you don't last very long, so it's much less harmful than NFL.
[01:04:03.335 --> 01:04:06.737]  See, the pads, overall, in the end, hurt you worse.
[01:04:07.297 --> 01:04:13.542]  Because they extend, unnaturally, how long you can be in these high-punishment zones, but you're still getting the concussions.
[01:04:14.182 --> 01:04:21.145]  Uh, whereas UFC, yeah, you may not have as long a life in the sport, and your ears may look like cauliflowers, but your brain isn't going to be as dingy.
[01:04:21.866 --> 01:04:24.467]  Uh, and again, I've looked deeply into that, because it's very interesting.
[01:04:24.487 --> 01:04:26.848]  I've also had a lot of head trauma, uh, myself.
[01:04:26.888 --> 01:04:34.832]  Not from, uh, fighting professionally, but car wrecks and having people hit me upside the head with a, you know, pole axe and stuff like that.
[01:04:35.072 --> 01:04:37.553]  Uh, but, uh, listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:04:37.573 --> 01:04:38.394]  That's a really good point.
[01:04:38.414 --> 01:04:39.134]  Yeah, I did see that.
[01:04:39.174 --> 01:04:40.335]  That's in the stack to get to.
[01:04:40.355 --> 01:04:42.836]  Uh, obviously, he meant...
[01:04:43.609 --> 01:04:45.192]  You know, I'd like to fight him in the ring.
[01:04:46.134 --> 01:04:47.757]  And, uh, you don't do that in America.
[01:04:48.298 --> 01:04:56.152]  Now, it'd be one thing if Obama was some 70-year-old president, but Obama likes to run around like he's, you know, some kind of sports icon, so, uh, get in the ring!
[01:04:58.018 --> 01:04:59.460]  Come on, we'll be right back.
[01:04:59.981 --> 01:05:04.226]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:04.547 --> 01:05:08.612]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:08.893 --> 01:05:14.260]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:15.061]  It's true.
[01:05:15.361 --> 01:05:20.785]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:21.066 --> 01:05:24.349]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:24.649 --> 01:05:29.113]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:29.373 --> 01:05:31.735]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:32.135 --> 01:05:35.458]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:36.579 --> 01:05:40.501]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:05:40.721 --> 01:05:45.503]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:06:00.745 --> 01:06:15.212]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:06:16.213 --> 01:06:19.895]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:20.925 --> 01:06:32.916]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:06:33.677 --> 01:06:40.943]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:06:41.624 --> 01:06:51.234]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[01:06:51.994 --> 01:06:55.278]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.

[01:06:59.693 --> 01:07:03.635]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:07:03.875 --> 01:07:09.918]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:07:10.298 --> 01:07:17.381]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:07:17.681 --> 01:07:22.223]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[01:07:22.543 --> 01:07:31.059]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[01:07:31.219 --> 01:07:34.946]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[01:07:35.461 --> 01:07:41.645]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:07:42.225 --> 01:07:45.647]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:07:46.147 --> 01:07:52.751]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[01:07:53.091 --> 01:07:53.712]  Thank you.
[01:08:00.370 --> 01:08:05.151]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:05.511 --> 01:08:07.812]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:07.832 --> 01:08:17.155]  And he just joined us, a caller, Jonathan of Kansas brought up Jacob Volkman.
[01:08:18.612 --> 01:08:22.918]  Who said about Obama, somebody needs to knock some sense into that idiot.
[01:08:22.978 --> 01:08:24.641]  That's what the media went with that headline.
[01:08:24.981 --> 01:08:26.523]  They said, why do you want to fight him in the ring?
[01:08:27.044 --> 01:08:29.788]  And he said, well, I'd like to knock some sense into him in the ring.
[01:08:30.349 --> 01:08:32.912]  But they took it out of context and did send
[01:08:34.042 --> 01:08:41.710]  The secret service after him and I heard this a few days ago but didn't cover it on air because we had more important issues to cover.
[01:08:42.491 --> 01:08:45.915]  But the overall message is they know full well this guy isn't planning anything violent.
[01:08:46.635 --> 01:08:54.223]  They just wanted to go there and intimidate him to send the message that you little people sit down and shut up and you don't talk about the puppet in chief.
[01:08:54.864 --> 01:09:00.513]  They also protect the president so vehemently to project the image that the president actually runs something.
[01:09:00.993 --> 01:09:07.463]  So the president can be politically blamed in the end and then replaced with new birdcage liner for the new world order.
[01:09:07.704 --> 01:09:09.006]  Let's go ahead and play that short clip.
[01:09:10.919 --> 01:09:12.360]  So now you've got a big win over a veteran.
[01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:13.081]  Who do you want next?
[01:09:14.042 --> 01:09:14.603]  It doesn't matter.
[01:09:15.003 --> 01:09:15.884]  Uh, Guida.
[01:09:16.625 --> 01:09:18.707]  I don't know, I'd... Actually, Obama.
[01:09:18.727 --> 01:09:21.309]  Wow, you're calling out Barack Obama right now.
[01:09:21.329 --> 01:09:21.890]  That's pretty big.
[01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:22.610]  That's ballsy.
[01:09:23.231 --> 01:09:24.052]  He's not too bright.
[01:09:24.412 --> 01:09:29.037]  He made a lot of, like, the make it home affordable plan, and then his healthcare plan.
[01:09:29.817 --> 01:09:31.359]  Someone's gotta knock some sense into that idiot.
[01:09:33.155 --> 01:09:34.276]  And so, there you go.
[01:09:34.436 --> 01:09:35.537]  Say that in America.
[01:09:36.258 --> 01:09:38.119]  Obviously, it was a joke.
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:40.561]  The guy's laughing while he's saying it.
[01:09:41.582 --> 01:09:42.923]  And, no, you don't do that!
[01:09:44.364 --> 01:09:45.165]  You don't do that!
[01:09:46.826 --> 01:09:47.847]  Just ridiculous.
[01:09:48.748 --> 01:09:51.290]  Let's go now to the first-time caller line.
[01:09:51.390 --> 01:09:55.033]  Tracy in Indiana, then Keith, Janet, Tom, Nick, and others.
[01:09:55.073 --> 01:09:55.494]  Go ahead.
[01:09:56.174 --> 01:09:56.715]  Hello, Alex.
[01:09:56.755 --> 01:09:57.495]  Good day to you.
[01:09:57.695 --> 01:09:58.176]  Good day to you.
[01:09:58.616 --> 01:10:01.899]  Yeah, listen, first-time caller just helping test out this new line you got.
[01:10:02.751 --> 01:10:04.352]  I'm a single father.
[01:10:04.372 --> 01:10:05.473]  I get my son every weekend.
[01:10:05.493 --> 01:10:08.036]  I made the mistake of running the road last weekend.
[01:10:08.056 --> 01:10:11.138]  Boy, you talk about leaving a hole in your heart watching that movie.
[01:10:12.359 --> 01:10:15.022]  Well, that's really what happens when societies break down.
[01:10:15.922 --> 01:10:25.030]  Within 15 days, the majority of people become cannibals without food, and that's the type of world we could be entering if we're so immoral.
[01:10:25.711 --> 01:10:28.994]  If 7 million people died by starvation-related illnesses,
[01:10:29.834 --> 01:10:34.317]  During the 10 years of the Great Depression, we were 90% self-sufficient and agrarian.
[01:10:34.677 --> 01:10:37.559]  Now we're right at 90% urban and not self-sufficient.
[01:10:38.039 --> 01:10:48.064]  Less than 10% are self-sufficient, because it's estimated by university studies only half of rural people, which is 10% of the population, is self-sufficient.
[01:10:48.084 --> 01:10:52.047]  So that's 5% total, if half of the 10% are self-sufficient.
[01:10:52.087 --> 01:10:54.008]  So it is a very powerful film.
[01:10:54.328 --> 01:10:55.329]  I only watched it once.
[01:10:56.309 --> 01:10:59.811]  And I've had it there on the shelf, you know, where I like to jog every morning.
[01:11:00.352 --> 01:11:04.494]  On the treadmill, I like to watch a movie so I can suspend disbelief and forget that I'm jogging.
[01:11:05.715 --> 01:11:07.876]  And I just don't want to watch it again.
[01:11:08.337 --> 01:11:09.197]  It's that disturbing.
[01:11:09.777 --> 01:11:11.278]  Especially when you have children, but go ahead.
[01:11:11.919 --> 01:11:12.139]  Yeah.
[01:11:12.539 --> 01:11:14.901]  Another good movie is The Book of Eli with Morgan Freeman.
[01:11:15.061 --> 01:11:15.981]  I just watched that one also.
[01:11:16.001 --> 01:11:16.922]  I don't know if you've seen that one.
[01:11:19.136 --> 01:11:22.978]  I think that's not Morgan Freeman, that's Denzel Washington.
[01:11:23.538 --> 01:11:24.158]  Was it Denzel?
[01:11:24.278 --> 01:11:25.719]  Okay, my mistake, yeah.
[01:11:26.459 --> 01:11:31.081]  One other question, have you ever educated yourself on Uniform Commercial Code 1-207?
[01:11:31.401 --> 01:11:37.043]  I'm a little familiar with the Uniform Commercial Code, which supposedly codifies into code law, but it really doesn't.
[01:11:37.363 --> 01:11:41.925]  More and more they make law, whether it's fraudulent in color of law, but no, fill me in on that.
[01:11:42.245 --> 01:11:45.769]  Well, the 1-207 is the first book, 207th paragraph.
[01:11:45.789 --> 01:11:50.014]  It is the remedy or recourse to all the other Uniform Commercial Codes that are wrote after it.
[01:11:50.794 --> 01:11:58.223]  And if you have a timely assertion of use and common knowledge of that code, then you can, the courts have to hold you in a common law court.
[01:11:59.289 --> 01:12:02.791]  Basically, what you're doing is serving your right not to compel to perform.
[01:12:02.891 --> 01:12:11.436]  Yeah, I know folks have written that code on, you know, tickets and things under duress, and I think it's had, you know, some mixed response.
[01:12:12.256 --> 01:12:18.400]  Not that it isn't valid what you're saying, but most of the judges don't even know the law, much less the police.
[01:12:18.860 --> 01:12:22.122]  I mean, they know a lot more compared to the general public, but compared to somebody who's actually studied it,
[01:12:24.033 --> 01:12:27.196]  They don't know very much, but I mean, what success have you had with that?
[01:12:27.236 --> 01:12:29.458]  Or did you just read about somebody saying that?
[01:12:29.638 --> 01:12:32.120]  I have had success with local utility companies.
[01:12:32.561 --> 01:12:34.502]  I have had success with my local court.
[01:12:34.863 --> 01:12:36.845]  When it gets to the judge, yes, it does work.
[01:12:38.066 --> 01:12:39.327]  Unfortunately, I've had to move it.
[01:12:39.447 --> 01:12:44.592]  I've seen that and read that many times, and I always just get it all scrambled in my brain, and then I've never tested it myself.
[01:12:45.572 --> 01:12:46.513]  What's that code again?
[01:12:46.533 --> 01:12:48.255]  It's the Uniform Commercial Code 1-207.
[01:12:50.407 --> 01:12:54.950]  And with a timely, sufficient, explicit entry of the use and common knowledge.
[01:12:55.070 --> 01:12:56.652]  Isn't that 1-208 now?
[01:12:57.792 --> 01:13:01.215]  It's 207.7 is what I was educated about 15 years ago.
[01:13:01.635 --> 01:13:02.756]  I've known this for 15 years.
[01:13:02.776 --> 01:13:05.678]  I believe that's why I didn't recognize what you were saying.
[01:13:07.469 --> 01:13:11.893]  I'm going to have to look that up because my memory doesn't serve during a break.
[01:13:11.913 --> 01:13:14.395]  Let's go ahead and talk to Keith in Florida.
[01:13:14.435 --> 01:13:15.075]  Keith, you're on the air.
[01:13:34.983 --> 01:13:35.463]  Hi, Alex.
[01:13:36.244 --> 01:13:38.986]  I want to tell you it's an honor to be able to call in and talk to you.
[01:13:39.386 --> 01:13:40.227]  I've been listening.
[01:13:40.247 --> 01:13:45.711]  I was awakened by a friend of mine, and it was the best thing I ever did, and I've got to let you know that.
[01:13:47.652 --> 01:13:52.336]  The reason why I was calling, I wanted to call in today as the first time calling, was because of the vaccines.
[01:13:52.416 --> 01:14:00.602]  To tell you, I listened to some of your strategies that you say that you should use, and we got our kids where they can't get vaccinated.
[01:14:01.295 --> 01:14:08.639]  And they go to private school and I was talking to the lady that owns the school and what she did was she read the information that I gave her.
[01:14:09.279 --> 01:14:10.740]  She used to be a registered nurse.
[01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:26.067]  She actually had a seminar with other nurses that are going through nursing programs to tell them that they should not recommend that kids or their kids or people get vaccinated because of what it's doing to our bodies.
[01:14:26.857 --> 01:14:36.344]  Well that's right, and just like they're having to cave in now on fluoride and admit it's hurting people, that's Associated Press today, they're going to cave in on this.
[01:14:36.524 --> 01:14:49.034]  It's not that they couldn't produce a vaccine that would actually help you get immunity, and that if you had something really deadly out there, like polio or smallpox, and it was killing a bunch of people, you'd want to go out and take it.
[01:14:49.454 --> 01:14:51.176]  It's that, A, they're eugenicists,
[01:14:51.556 --> 01:14:53.658]  Who've been caught in the official U.N.
[01:14:53.678 --> 01:15:02.445]  and Rockefeller documents that we've published and showed again yesterday on air at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com that they're adding things to it.
[01:15:03.246 --> 01:15:08.531]  Cancer viruses, sterilants, White House science czar calling for putting stuff in the water.
[01:15:08.871 --> 01:15:11.113]  I mean, you can't trust them.
[01:15:11.453 --> 01:15:13.215]  Plus, they give liability protection.
[01:15:13.815 --> 01:15:25.383]  So it's not just that there's a eugenics angle, then there's a liability protection since the 70s where they use taxpayer money to secretly, in the Vaccine Damage Fund, pay people off if they can jump through a hundred hoops and prove they were damaged.
[01:15:25.884 --> 01:15:33.269]  And then third, the trifecta, you know now that the vast majority of vaccines are manufactured in Communist China.
[01:15:34.650 --> 01:15:43.799]  So you've got this sworn enemy, they're eugenicists, you've got all their history of melamine and the milk and everything else and lead in the toys, and now they're making our drugs.
[01:15:44.719 --> 01:15:48.322]  And they're making a lot of the preservative additives that are then added to our foods.
[01:15:48.402 --> 01:15:51.804]  I mean, this is... We've got to have a boycott China movement.
[01:15:51.824 --> 01:15:54.086]  We have got... And I know it's almost impossible.
[01:15:54.526 --> 01:15:55.727]  Almost everything's made in China.
[01:15:56.628 --> 01:15:57.629]  It is the death of us.
[01:15:58.069 --> 01:16:01.932]  They have rivers routinely just lighting on fire now.
[01:16:02.232 --> 01:16:03.133]  They're so toxic.
[01:16:03.233 --> 01:16:04.093]  I mean, it is...
[01:16:05.254 --> 01:16:12.103]  Yes, I wanted to let you know that one thing that I do when I'm out, it doesn't matter if I'm at the office supply store, if I'm at the repair center, I start talking.
[01:16:25.231 --> 01:16:25.512]  I don't
[01:16:42.293 --> 01:16:43.314]  Hit the nail on the head.
[01:16:43.534 --> 01:17:01.507]  So I just want to tell you that you give me the courage to go out because you get up every day, you said you're the tip of the spear, and I tell you, I'm one of the feathers in that arrow because I tell you, I'm going out and I'm telling as many people as I can, and the awakening is a result of you, and that you follow up every day.
[01:17:01.827 --> 01:17:03.168]  That builds the credibility.
[01:17:03.228 --> 01:17:09.373]  So thank you for what you're doing, and thank you for what you do to try to get the word out and save this republic, okay?
[01:17:09.833 --> 01:17:10.513]  God bless you.
[01:17:10.873 --> 01:17:11.634]  God bless you, Keith.
[01:17:11.974 --> 01:17:13.434]  Folks, did you hear his voice?
[01:17:13.454 --> 01:17:14.655]  Did you hear his spirit?
[01:17:14.955 --> 01:17:16.415]  That was the spirit of victory.
[01:17:16.716 --> 01:17:17.536]  The spirit of truth.
[01:17:17.576 --> 01:17:18.776]  Could you feel it?
[01:17:19.397 --> 01:17:27.059]  In my gut, in my soul, I was in a connection with Keith 800 miles away from where I sit.
[01:17:27.079 --> 01:17:31.481]  I just got chills right there because he has discovered the secret.
[01:17:33.001 --> 01:17:44.109]  Keith, we are all the tip of the spear and the shaft of the arrow and the feathers and the eye that guides it and the arm and the shoulders and the hands that pull the bow.
[01:17:44.569 --> 01:17:47.972]  We are all in this symbiotically at a gut level.
[01:17:48.012 --> 01:17:57.759]  The survival instinct of humanity is strong and people subconsciously, intellectually, spiritually in their discernment know things are wrong and it's so unusual
[01:17:58.359 --> 01:18:04.964]  To see somebody in a hardware store, not just talking about the weather or sports, but to do what humans are really supposed to do.
[01:18:05.004 --> 01:18:06.685]  You know, things are wrong in this country.
[01:18:07.005 --> 01:18:07.766]  We're Americans.
[01:18:07.806 --> 01:18:08.826]  We're free human beings.
[01:18:08.986 --> 01:18:13.990]  Other folks, whether they're Germans or Chinese or whatever they are, they know things are wrong.
[01:18:14.971 --> 01:18:16.171]  Mexico, it doesn't matter.
[01:18:16.211 --> 01:18:16.692]  We know.
[01:18:17.032 --> 01:18:18.633]  We know the truth when we hear it and see it.
[01:18:18.673 --> 01:18:19.274]  We feel it!
[01:18:20.234 --> 01:18:23.395]  And we intellectually can see the facts of it, the proves of it.
[01:18:24.135 --> 01:18:28.957]  And so when you resonate, and the reason you're so effective is because you're not like timid.
[01:18:29.217 --> 01:18:31.058]  Hey, you think things are kind of weird a little?
[01:18:31.078 --> 01:18:33.518]  I know you don't want to see it, but here's a video.
[01:18:33.538 --> 01:18:34.939]  They're going to laugh at you.
[01:18:36.391 --> 01:18:37.012]  At least some will.
[01:18:37.512 --> 01:18:39.455]  Those that are tuned in will say, thank you very much, oh great.
[01:18:40.156 --> 01:18:45.002]  But you need to just resonate with confidence in the truth and you're there to warn people.
[01:18:45.443 --> 01:18:47.005]  I'm here with some important information.
[01:18:47.445 --> 01:18:51.370]  Here's a film, here's a documentary, here's a website, here's a business card with a website on it.
[01:18:51.731 --> 01:18:52.732]  Start your own locally.
[01:18:52.993 --> 01:18:54.515]  Start your own newsletter in the neighborhood.
[01:18:56.008 --> 01:19:00.311]  And have that spirit of just telling the truth and reaching out to people.
[01:19:00.791 --> 01:19:01.851]  It is so exciting.
[01:19:02.292 --> 01:19:03.312]  And it's unstoppable.
[01:19:03.893 --> 01:19:04.713]  It's unstoppable.
[01:19:05.073 --> 01:19:10.396]  If you turn your power loose, there is nothing the globalists can do.
[01:19:11.557 --> 01:19:13.819]  Under heaven and earth, to stop us.
[01:19:13.879 --> 01:19:16.882]  The only thing that could stop us is God, and we're on God's side.
[01:19:16.902 --> 01:19:18.364]  And the globalists hate that!
[01:19:18.504 --> 01:19:20.766]  People that say, we've got God on our side, and who really do.
[01:19:21.046 --> 01:19:26.972]  Who are standing up for what's fundamentally right, fundamentally wholesome, fundamentally decent, in every culture.
[01:19:27.232 --> 01:19:28.293]  People have a conscience.
[01:19:28.553 --> 01:19:30.035]  They know what we're designed to do.
[01:19:30.315 --> 01:19:31.496]  They know what's right and wrong.
[01:19:32.357 --> 01:19:35.920]  Anytime I do something wrong, half the time by forgetting or not paying attention,
[01:19:36.821 --> 01:19:40.123]  You know, being vulgar, or being worldly, or lusting, or whatever.
[01:19:40.143 --> 01:19:42.425]  You know, I catch myself, and I just go, man.
[01:19:43.566 --> 01:19:48.749]  Because I know, not because I was told that when I was a kid, I know inside, it doesn't feel good.
[01:19:50.170 --> 01:19:50.650]  Deep down.
[01:19:50.910 --> 01:19:52.651]  It feels good on the surface, but not deep down.
[01:19:53.412 --> 01:19:54.072]  We'll be right back.
[01:19:54.693 --> 01:19:55.233]  Stay with us.
[01:19:55.854 --> 01:19:58.515]  I'm gonna get into the fluoride, then our next guest, and we'll take a bunch of your calls.
[01:19:58.535 --> 01:19:59.176]  I promise.

[01:21:14.638 --> 01:21:16.780]  When I first joined, I was being sued.

[01:21:59.246 --> 01:22:01.067]  I'm Roger Rao at Midas Resources.
[01:22:01.327 --> 01:22:08.249]  If you are going through a financial rollercoaster because of your investment in stocks, bonds, and other paper assets, perhaps you're ready for a change.
[01:22:08.409 --> 01:22:11.430]  You have an opportunity to change your financial security.

[01:22:39.653 --> 01:22:43.554]  Your natural organic herbal formula for heart health is Heart and Body Extract.
[01:22:43.574 --> 01:22:46.495]  My name is Spann and I'm 68 years old and I live in Vermont.
[01:23:07.185 --> 01:23:11.669]  In the spring of 2003, I started to have problems with my heart.
[01:23:11.929 --> 01:23:13.831]  It felt like my heart was pounding.
[01:23:13.851 --> 01:23:15.312]  It made me feel breathless.
[01:23:15.733 --> 01:23:19.776]  I tried many, many different things to try to get some help for myself.
[01:23:20.176 --> 01:23:21.177]  Nothing did anything.
[01:23:21.237 --> 01:23:25.201]  Heart and Body Extract is very powerful, very effective, and works quickly.
[01:23:25.221 --> 01:23:28.684]  I saw one of Sharon's ads and ordered Heart and Body Extract.
[01:23:29.364 --> 01:23:32.007]  I noticed a difference quickly, within days.
[01:23:32.427 --> 01:23:37.068]  The episodes became less frequent and by a month had completely vanished.
[01:23:37.448 --> 01:23:40.029]  Usually you find a 30-day or 60-day guarantee.
[01:23:40.249 --> 01:23:44.850]  Heart and Body Extract comes with a lifetime 100% ironclad money-back guarantee.
[01:23:45.050 --> 01:23:46.750]  Details at HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305.
[01:23:46.770 --> 01:23:46.930]  Call 866-295-5305.
[01:23:46.950 --> 01:23:48.211]  866-295-5305 for Heart and Body Extract.
[01:24:17.079 --> 01:24:19.641]  Well, here is the super good news.
[01:24:19.721 --> 01:24:20.983]  Of course, it's a deception.
[01:24:21.943 --> 01:24:22.844]  It's a whitewash.
[01:24:23.625 --> 01:24:27.448]  But it is a devastating blow against these people.
[01:24:28.630 --> 01:24:39.099]  You know, there have been, no exaggeration, hundreds of major studies directly linking the massive increase of autism or brain damage to vaccines and the adjuvants.
[01:24:40.421 --> 01:24:43.463]  That accelerate the autoimmune response in small children.
[01:24:44.023 --> 01:24:50.406]  It's been proven in just so many studies we've had brain surgeons on, like Dr. Blaylock and others, that it causes brain swelling.
[01:24:52.487 --> 01:24:58.570]  And we saw the increase in sudden infant death syndrome vaccines.
[01:24:59.951 --> 01:25:06.474]  The shaken baby, oh you shook your baby, then they've done studies correlating it to within the first 6 to 12 hours after the shots.
[01:25:08.131 --> 01:25:10.011]  Because the hospital isn't going to admit they did it to your kid.
[01:25:10.051 --> 01:25:10.532]  Or the clinic.
[01:25:10.572 --> 01:25:11.552]  They're just going to take your kid.
[01:25:12.392 --> 01:25:14.753]  After they juice him up and your body has an autoimmune response.
[01:25:15.053 --> 01:25:17.033]  And it hits the pancreas and other things as well.
[01:25:18.553 --> 01:25:20.634]  But they try to deny all that.
[01:25:21.134 --> 01:25:22.734]  And then they'll put out a CNN report.
[01:25:22.874 --> 01:25:24.635]  Oh, this doctor's been discredited.
[01:25:25.615 --> 01:25:28.836]  And then we have the doctor on who did the studies and they just say he's discredited.
[01:25:30.216 --> 01:25:33.477]  Kind of like Gary Webb in the Dark Alliance Pulitzer Prize winner.
[01:25:34.346 --> 01:25:54.515]  They told him that his evidence wasn't true, they had no proof, they got the San Jose Mercury News, globalist owned and run, to throw him under the bus, and then he was writing a book, double proving it all, double tough, with all the new evidence that had come out, the CIA had since admitted it, and he got shot twice in the head and the police said it was suicide.
[01:25:57.401 --> 01:26:03.024]  And if you'll buy that, I'll throw the Golden Gate Bridge in free, as George Strait would say.
[01:26:03.684 --> 01:26:05.225]  So they've got a history of this.
[01:26:05.605 --> 01:26:15.510]  And when you look at fluoride, it's so naked, brazen, out in the open, just in your face, that it makes your head spin.
[01:26:17.391 --> 01:26:19.892]  And again, we've had so many medical doctors on about this.
[01:26:21.147 --> 01:26:22.007]  Endocrinologist.
[01:26:22.868 --> 01:26:31.030]  Well, we've got the incredible Dr. Conant interview up on PrisonPlanet.tv, hour-long, going through all the documents on this.
[01:26:33.410 --> 01:26:40.612]  And there he was, a big top chemist and laughed at his wife and went to disprove what she was saying in the literature and found it was worse than she even thought.
[01:26:41.693 --> 01:26:46.614]  We're going to get him on, by the way, he's on vacation right now, but we'll have him on in the next few weeks to cover this big development.
[01:26:47.494 --> 01:26:49.395]  We ought to get Dr. Blaylock on about this as well.
[01:26:50.970 --> 01:26:52.613]  But this is out of MSNBC.
[01:26:52.633 --> 01:26:55.199]  They've reposted an AP article.
[01:26:55.259 --> 01:26:57.684]  Too much fluoride in water, government says.
[01:26:59.980 --> 01:27:03.522]  DirectPrisonPlanet.tv viewers for the fact that it's up on screen.
[01:27:04.343 --> 01:27:06.184]  Oh, and look, it's an AP exclusive!
[01:27:06.364 --> 01:27:06.584]  U.S.
[01:27:06.604 --> 01:27:07.525]  has too much fluoride.
[01:27:08.706 --> 01:27:09.906]  Oh, unexclusive!
[01:27:10.607 --> 01:27:12.288]  The moon is not made of cheese!
[01:27:13.289 --> 01:27:14.069]  Unexclusive!
[01:27:14.529 --> 01:27:15.510]  Grass is green!
[01:27:16.331 --> 01:27:17.071]  Unexclusive!
[01:27:17.391 --> 01:27:18.592]  Chihuahuas bark!
[01:27:19.372 --> 01:27:20.113]  Unexclusive!
[01:27:20.253 --> 01:27:21.374]  Bill Clinton lies!
[01:27:21.854 --> 01:27:22.695]  Unexclusive!
[01:27:24.096 --> 01:27:25.456]  Al Gore is a scam artist!
[01:27:25.596 --> 01:27:26.737]  I mean, come on!
[01:27:26.897 --> 01:27:27.638]  Unexclusive!
[01:27:30.267 --> 01:27:33.630]  This is very exclusive information you're about to get.
[01:27:33.710 --> 01:27:38.795]  No one... I remember two years ago, exclusive Associated Press.
[01:27:38.895 --> 01:27:41.198]  Government secretly taking baby's blood at birth.
[01:27:43.079 --> 01:27:45.161]  And but they said for the last five years.
[01:27:46.643 --> 01:27:47.564]  It's 39.
[01:27:47.644 --> 01:27:51.708]  We have all the documents and have published them over a decade ago.
[01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:53.581]  I'm not tootin' my horn!
[01:27:53.921 --> 01:27:55.062]  That's what's frustrating!
[01:27:55.423 --> 01:28:01.388]  I've got the UN head IPCC here, openly saying they want a total police statement to kill you.
[01:28:02.089 --> 01:28:04.571]  On PrisonPlanet.com, with links to the papers.
[01:28:04.931 --> 01:28:05.312]  Okay?!
[01:28:07.694 --> 01:28:13.579]  If I get the documents and confirm they're taking your baby's blood at birth for a secret bioweapons lab, it's real!
[01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:14.881]  I'm sorry.
[01:28:14.901 --> 01:28:15.761]  I'm sorry.
[01:28:16.902 --> 01:28:17.183]  I'm sorry.
[01:28:18.982 --> 01:28:21.744]  I should be positive, and I am happy, but it also makes me mad!
[01:28:21.764 --> 01:28:25.087]  This could all end very quickly!
[01:28:25.107 --> 01:28:37.157]  We wouldn't be in a utopia, but the world would get a lot better if, if, if, if people would get out of denial and start researching.
[01:28:37.217 --> 01:28:38.699]  It's all right there.
[01:28:39.795 --> 01:28:52.722]  I've likened it to the police pulling a car over, and they smell something, and there's blood on the seat, and they open the trunk, there's five dead bodies, and then they find videotapes of the driver has in his bag of him chopping the women up.
[01:28:52.983 --> 01:28:54.664]  I mean, it's open and shut, okay?
[01:28:54.744 --> 01:28:57.625]  I mean, it's just absolutely ridiculous.
[01:28:59.967 --> 01:29:06.290]  Dinecourt, four miles from where I sit, has been all over the news for a decade, kidnapping kids.
[01:29:06.350 --> 01:29:07.271]  None of them get in trouble.
[01:29:08.396 --> 01:29:10.759]  Instead, I get death threats every time I talk about it.
[01:29:13.602 --> 01:29:16.985]  Because it's a big building, it's guys in suits, the police are scared.
[01:29:20.865 --> 01:29:21.325]  Here it is.
[01:29:21.385 --> 01:29:23.066]  Too much fluoride in water, government says.
[01:29:23.386 --> 01:29:24.987]  High levels causing spots on teeth.
[01:29:25.427 --> 01:29:27.048]  Recommended limit to be lowered.
[01:29:27.669 --> 01:29:36.833]  So, they know we've been exposing them, and they know everybody's getting these horrible teeth now, and that's admitted cause by, so they're like, okay, just, just cut back, just cut back what's in the water.
[01:29:37.033 --> 01:29:38.814]  When they know full well, that's nothing.
[01:29:39.655 --> 01:29:48.479]  It's the topical, massive levels that dwarf it in the toothpaste, and then they're adding it to the food, and using it as a pesticide that bioaccumulates.
[01:29:50.387 --> 01:29:53.375]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.395 --> 01:29:57.005]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.086 --> 01:30:01.206]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:30:01.246 --> 01:30:07.908]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:30:08.168 --> 01:30:10.448]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:30:10.729 --> 01:30:15.930]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:30:16.110 --> 01:30:18.870]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:30:19.150 --> 01:30:21.211]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:30:21.471 --> 01:30:27.396]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:30:27.716 --> 01:30:30.919]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:30:31.099 --> 01:30:36.624]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:30:36.884 --> 01:30:38.185]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:30:38.525 --> 01:30:39.686]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:30:39.826 --> 01:30:42.368]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:30:42.488 --> 01:30:46.552]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:30:46.712 --> 01:30:49.314]  You can find the video at www dot
[01:30:49.494 --> 01:30:51.195]  End of America 3.com.
[01:30:51.315 --> 01:30:53.777]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[01:31:00.424 --> 01:31:03.027]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:31:03.427 --> 01:31:08.392]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:31:08.752 --> 01:31:10.514]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:31:10.814 --> 01:31:15.619]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:31:15.819 --> 01:31:16.760]  How much do you want?
[01:31:17.001 --> 01:31:17.741]  When do you want it?
[01:31:18.122 --> 01:31:19.723]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:31:20.003 --> 01:31:20.824]  When will you need it?
[01:31:21.085 --> 01:31:23.147]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:31:23.287 --> 01:31:24.268]  Will there be any food?
[01:31:24.608 --> 01:31:28.511]  Will it make your children sick if there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself?
[01:31:28.671 --> 01:31:31.192]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:31:31.393 --> 01:31:34.575]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:31:34.975 --> 01:31:38.477]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:31:38.797 --> 01:31:39.778]  How much will you need?
[01:31:40.038 --> 01:31:40.639]  We don't know.
[01:31:40.939 --> 01:31:41.840]  How much do you want?
[01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:42.760]  All you can get.
[01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:43.821]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:31:44.061 --> 01:31:46.823]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:31:47.123 --> 01:31:49.284]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com
[01:31:54.628 --> 01:31:58.531]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[01:32:00.712 --> 01:32:04.374]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:32:04.755 --> 01:32:07.757]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:32:07.997 --> 01:32:12.780]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:19.044]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:32:19.184 --> 01:32:21.426]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:32:21.946 --> 01:32:22.226]  Tim Geithner?
[01:32:22.246 --> 01:32:22.686]  Bernanke?
[01:32:22.766 --> 01:32:23.527]  They're arsonists!
[01:32:23.567 --> 01:32:24.667]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:32:24.687 --> 01:32:26.968]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:32:40.854 --> 01:32:47.757]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:32:48.137 --> 01:32:57.241]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:33:03.288 --> 01:33:04.009]  Big Brother.
[01:33:04.290 --> 01:33:05.552]  Mainstream media.
[01:33:05.953 --> 01:33:07.115]  Government cover-ups.
[01:33:07.356 --> 01:33:08.317]  You want answers?
[01:33:08.618 --> 01:33:09.720]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:10.682 --> 01:33:14.589]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:19.167 --> 01:33:29.850]  We are going to be having, of course, our once-a-week visit with Bob Chatman coming up in the next hour.
[01:33:29.870 --> 01:33:39.972]  We'll have open phones throughout that entire interview for Janet, Chuck, Julio, Tom, Jacob, JB, and others that are patiently holding.
[01:33:40.972 --> 01:33:43.013]  I will get to you.
[01:33:44.266 --> 01:33:46.287]  But finishing up with this huge announcement.
[01:33:46.727 --> 01:34:00.431]  Now, this is about five and a half, almost six years old now, that the American Dental Association covered their hind end and put out a quiet advisory to dentists that people under six should not brush their teeth with fluoride toothpaste.
[01:34:00.451 --> 01:34:02.232]  Now, kindergartens nationwide
[01:34:03.257 --> 01:34:07.579]  The local dental associations, you know, they give them the fluoride pills that are a lot more powerful.
[01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:19.526]  All the fluoride, they promote the fluoride at the kids, and it causes weakening of the teeth internally, the bones, and dental fluorosis, the yellow, ugly spots that you see most kids have now.
[01:34:19.546 --> 01:34:21.587]  I mean, most kids I see have it.
[01:34:22.387 --> 01:34:23.348]  Gone are the pearly whites.
[01:34:24.969 --> 01:34:27.450]  Because it calcifies out in the bones and teeth and brain.
[01:34:29.153 --> 01:34:39.455]  And now, so much medical evidence has come out, and over 90% of the EPA and FDA scientists, over and over again, write letters and go to Congress and say, what are you doing?
[01:34:39.735 --> 01:34:41.695]  This is increasing cancer massively.
[01:34:42.195 --> 01:34:43.316]  It's 100% proven.
[01:34:43.916 --> 01:34:44.516]  What are you doing?
[01:34:45.736 --> 01:34:53.858]  And their answer is, okay, okay, 1.2 parts per million, or 0.7 parts per million, that's too much.
[01:34:57.805 --> 01:35:00.267]  You know, we think we're going to lower it down.
[01:35:00.287 --> 01:35:01.627]  You can read the whole AP article.
[01:35:02.288 --> 01:35:03.529]  But you still need it for your teeth.
[01:35:04.849 --> 01:35:09.672]  Well, the studies show even 0.5 are going to do similar things, not quite as bad.
[01:35:09.973 --> 01:35:12.354]  But then you look at how much is in toothpaste.
[01:35:12.454 --> 01:35:14.495]  It's off the chart compared to the water.
[01:35:15.396 --> 01:35:17.117]  The problem is the water, it's so cumulative.
[01:35:17.898 --> 01:35:19.659]  Where do a lot of drugs get absorbed?
[01:35:19.679 --> 01:35:22.781]  Some of the best places to absorb drugs, if it's not going to be
[01:35:23.991 --> 01:35:33.813]  Injected and if you want to get it past the stomach that blocks out a lot of toxic things in the intestines, you take it in the mouth, under the tongue, in the saliva glands, and all the blood vessels in the mouth.
[01:35:34.774 --> 01:35:40.915]  That's why they say on the back of the toothpaste, if you swallow a pea size or more, call poison control immediately.
[01:35:41.595 --> 01:35:45.116]  I mean, that's what rat poison is made out of, many of the major brands.
[01:35:47.576 --> 01:35:49.597]  So, and if you want to see that, just search
[01:35:51.826 --> 01:35:58.529]  Rat poison, fluoride, click images and you'll see all the box it covers with fluoride as the poison.
[01:35:59.369 --> 01:36:07.232]  So, fluoride in drinking water credited with dramatically cutting cavities and tooth decay may now be too much of a good thing.
[01:36:07.312 --> 01:36:08.593]  Oh, it's now too much.
[01:36:08.633 --> 01:36:11.514]  It wasn't before, so there's no liability, it just may be now.
[01:36:12.901 --> 01:36:14.743]  It's causing spots on some kids' teeth.
[01:36:15.464 --> 01:36:26.716]  As reported, an increase in the spotting problem is one reason the federal government will announce Friday it plans to lower the recommended limit in fluoride in water supplies, the first such change in nearly 50 years.
[01:36:29.298 --> 01:36:40.321]  I'm going to finish this later when Bob Chapman's on with us, but it's total spin because they know they can make it a non-issue, and I believe they may finally just completely remove it from water entirely.
[01:36:40.341 --> 01:36:40.741]  You know why?
[01:36:40.761 --> 01:36:44.562]  Because it's now put in thousands of foods, almost everything that's processed.
[01:36:44.982 --> 01:36:49.103]  It's now sprayed on crops and goes through the cell wall and bioaccumulates.
[01:36:49.143 --> 01:36:50.163]  We've had the chemist on.
[01:36:53.148 --> 01:37:00.834]  They've had the experts on plants on with a doctorate in studying farming and it is in the toothpaste so they don't care.
[01:37:01.115 --> 01:37:02.676]  They realize it's reached a tipping point.
[01:37:02.896 --> 01:37:07.180]  People are suing and rampaging nationwide against their city councils when they laugh.
[01:37:07.420 --> 01:37:09.461]  See, now the city council guy laughs at you.
[01:37:09.682 --> 01:37:10.322]  The mayor laughs.
[01:37:10.562 --> 01:37:13.365]  People don't put their tail between their legs and feel stupid and leave.
[01:37:13.545 --> 01:37:14.646]  They get mad and start suing.
[01:37:16.007 --> 01:37:22.609]  And the big secret is, they're putting hundreds of other chemicals in under the name of fluoride, and if we keep pushing, it's over for them.
[01:37:22.949 --> 01:37:26.530]  But you're going to have to get it out of the food next, and the toothpaste, okay?
[01:37:26.950 --> 01:37:27.610]  Huge victory!
[01:37:27.850 --> 01:37:30.031]  Charlotte, I wanted to get to that victory and get your take on it.
[01:37:30.431 --> 01:37:43.495]  Iszerby, for those that don't know, was the head of policy at the Department of Education under Ronald Reagan, and she discovered that it was an absolute plan to dumb kids down and teach them how to only regurgitate information.
[01:37:44.515 --> 01:37:51.182]  Suddenly, I've seen a lot of mainstream articles admitting all of this, and how we're last behind the industrialized world now in all of this.
[01:37:51.202 --> 01:37:54.485]  But she got all the documents out, put it in her book, Deliberate Dumbing Down.
[01:37:54.746 --> 01:37:56.287]  The website's deliberatedumbingdown.com.
[01:37:56.307 --> 01:38:01.612]  It's now out of print, but she's graciously put a free e-version up there on the site.
[01:38:02.393 --> 01:38:03.994]  And of course, she also worked with the U.S.
[01:38:04.014 --> 01:38:08.477]  Department of Education before that, worked in the Foreign Service, Japan, Guam during the Korean War.
[01:38:08.797 --> 01:38:10.979]  Her dad and grandfather, of course, were skull and bones.
[01:38:11.619 --> 01:38:13.280]  And we really appreciate her joining us.
[01:38:13.300 --> 01:38:21.545]  The reason she's on us for the next 20 minutes is she was on about a week and a half ago, and the show ended right as she was getting into
[01:38:22.606 --> 01:38:31.090]  How conservatives are controlled, and she brought up the CNP, which I haven't done a lot of research on.
[01:38:31.110 --> 01:38:46.377]  People have asked about it, so I've done some, that reportedly the Hunt brothers helped set up and things, and she was saying that that's not a real organization or that that isn't a conservative group trying to take America back or fight the New World Order, as they claim, but actually is the New World Order and her experiences with them.
[01:38:46.397 --> 01:38:47.557]  So I wanted to get her up.
[01:38:47.637 --> 01:38:48.878]  Charlotte, great having you back with us.
[01:38:49.670 --> 01:39:00.836]  Thank you, Alex, and we don't have much time today, so really it's probably just as well because, you know, it's better when I don't have a lot of time than I have to do bullets, huh?
[01:39:01.556 --> 01:39:13.162]  But, uh, the basic, you know, this is terrible to have to tell people this, but we are merging right now with the Soviet Union.
[01:39:14.503 --> 01:39:26.952]  I know, you know, people don't accept that because they had to have the phony fall of the Soviet Union so that all of you, and you're a bit smart, but so the rest of the world would really think that communism was dead.
[01:39:27.713 --> 01:39:30.294]  And communism is not dead at all.
[01:39:30.375 --> 01:39:33.977]  It's more alive than it ever was before the phony fall.
[01:39:35.078 --> 01:39:41.783]  What we're looking at right now is what Rowan Gaither, the president of the Ford Foundation, told
[01:39:44.286 --> 01:39:58.549]  The research director for the Congressional Committee Investigating the Tax-Exempt Foundation, Norman Dodd, in 1954, at a closed, sort of a closed, off-the-record meeting.
[01:40:00.089 --> 01:40:10.411]  And your listeners have heard this before, but you've got to keep listening and keep telling people this, because although it sounds outlandish and off the wall, it's true.
[01:40:11.272 --> 01:40:30.597]  He was told by the President of the Ford Foundation that the foundations received their instructions from the White House, of course that was 1953 under President Eisenhower, who later, just five years later, you know, during the Cold War, signed the first agreement with the Soviets in every area imaginable.
[01:40:31.537 --> 01:40:37.019]  So anyway, but he was told that they got their instructions, the foundations from the White House,
[01:40:37.817 --> 01:40:38.118]  I think?
[01:40:54.173 --> 01:40:57.937]  With the North American Union, which they're quieter now.
[01:40:57.977 --> 01:41:00.159]  They're hiding away because of the good people.
[01:41:00.399 --> 01:41:06.686]  And they're using the fake environmental movement as a way to collectivize and cut off resources as a mode of control.
[01:41:06.706 --> 01:41:09.769]  And just to back you up, I mean, we can pull this up.
[01:41:10.769 --> 01:41:21.155]  Actually, the Carnegie Foundation, in multiple congressional hearings, their early minutes, even from the 20s, have been released, where they said this was the plan all along, and it turns out U.S.
[01:41:21.215 --> 01:41:27.278]  and British intelligence, and this has been partially declassified, did put the Bolsheviks into power.
[01:41:27.538 --> 01:41:30.800]  So it isn't just like they're merging, the whole thing was set up by the banks.
[01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:34.942]  But Charlotte, people really wanted to hear about this CMP thing.
[01:41:37.859 --> 01:41:38.559]  The CMT.
[01:41:38.619 --> 01:41:41.640]  I'm just going to briefly tell you my experience.
[01:41:41.740 --> 01:41:48.022]  When I was in the Department of Education, I got down there, I was just bewildered all the time by different things that kept happening.
[01:41:48.762 --> 01:41:57.385]  And so I finally got fired because I leaked a document which was to control the curriculum on the computer throughout the country.
[01:41:58.165 --> 01:42:03.347]  And I couldn't understand why Ronald Reagan was allowing that to happen.
[01:42:03.487 --> 01:42:05.508]  I was beginning to see that Ronald Reagan
[01:42:06.969 --> 01:42:10.691]  Was not at all what I had thought he was.
[01:42:10.811 --> 01:42:13.753]  Well, he was known in the 50s as Red Ronnie.
[01:42:14.173 --> 01:42:17.335]  Absolutely, and I personally do not believe he ever changed.
[01:42:18.135 --> 01:42:20.076]  And all of that, a lot of that on my website.
[01:42:20.096 --> 01:42:24.819]  Well, John Wayne didn't like him in the 40s and 50s, and then later liked him because he claimed he was a conservative.
[01:42:24.859 --> 01:42:29.641]  Everybody knows John Wayne didn't like communists, but he admittedly was in with the communists earlier on.
[01:42:30.862 --> 01:42:33.583]  Well, you have to ask yourself why?
[01:42:34.004 --> 01:42:35.444]  Well, I was in the Department of Ed.
[01:42:35.564 --> 01:42:44.829]  I was a liaison with the White House for really public-private partnerships, which is the merging of the public and private sector.
[01:42:44.889 --> 01:42:46.830]  That's the Communist Manifesto, okay?
[01:42:47.851 --> 01:42:51.773]  And where government and business are merged together.
[01:42:51.793 --> 01:42:58.156]  So anyway, they were putting that in under Reagan, and I asked at the White House, I said, what on earth are they doing this for?
[01:42:58.236 --> 01:42:59.657]  Isn't this corporate fascism?
[01:43:00.700 --> 01:43:09.304]  And I was told, oh, I guess that, you know, the people involved, all the high up elitist people on the task force, uh, they just don't see it that way.
[01:43:09.424 --> 01:43:11.945]  So I, I was becoming very suspicious.
[01:43:12.565 --> 01:43:21.269]  Then, of course, what happens, aside from everything I saw in the Department of Ed, which is all in my book, I don't have to go through all that, people, it's a free, free download, okay?
[01:43:21.789 --> 01:43:29.433]  Then when I get out, I write a little book, Back to Basic Perform, for Skinnerian International Curriculum.
[01:43:30.140 --> 01:43:31.541]  And that was a brilliant little book.
[01:43:31.581 --> 01:43:33.003]  It's only 39 pages.
[01:43:33.163 --> 01:43:37.807]  And it is on my Deliberate Dumbing Down website as a free PDF.
[01:43:38.287 --> 01:43:42.351]  And it's how they turn the kids into biological robots, not free-thinking creatures.
[01:43:42.611 --> 01:43:43.271]  Yes, that's right.
[01:43:43.351 --> 01:43:45.793]  So, anyway, we're talking about CMP.
[01:43:46.354 --> 01:43:49.417]  All of a sudden, I thought, you know, everybody would want this little book.
[01:43:49.477 --> 01:43:55.522]  Well, it was boycotted by every single major conservative organization in the country.
[01:43:56.681 --> 01:43:58.582]  And I thought, what on earth is wrong here?
[01:43:58.622 --> 01:44:06.164]  Because that's a... Folks, go read that book, and you're going to see a little 39-page book that had it going all over this country and Canada.
[01:44:06.564 --> 01:44:18.328]  We would not now be looking at a school-to-work agenda, the Soviet system, a quota system for your children, which will control their lives lifelong, what they're going to do.
[01:44:18.668 --> 01:44:19.688]  We wouldn't be seeing that.
[01:44:19.748 --> 01:44:25.330]  We wouldn't be seeing charter schools, which I'll explain to you, are the vehicle to implement the Soviet system.
[01:44:25.650 --> 01:44:34.858]  I played a British government-funded cartoon for kids yesterday where they teach them that cities will be prison and that the government will decide what you're going to be.
[01:44:35.278 --> 01:44:38.861]  Well, that's exactly what we're looking at in the charter school movement.
[01:44:38.961 --> 01:44:52.532]  And the charter school movement, which is being supported by the school choice charter school movement, being supported heavily by the Heritage Foundation, the Council for National Policy, etc., is actually the downfall
[01:44:53.232 --> 01:44:54.013]  Of our country.
[01:44:54.133 --> 01:44:58.516]  I talk, we've got like a stool with two or three pegs.
[01:44:59.017 --> 01:45:07.103]  Two of the pegs are our free political system whereby we elect officials.
[01:45:07.823 --> 01:45:11.886]  The other peg, the most key thing for the economy, is we have a free economy.
[01:45:12.707 --> 01:45:16.310]  The charter schools are going to pull those two pegs right out.
[01:45:17.111 --> 01:45:27.444]  No elected officials, which will fall down into every area after they've taken over all the schools, and all the schools in this country are almost taken over by charter schools now.
[01:45:27.484 --> 01:45:29.486]  There are only 10 states fighting it, okay?
[01:45:29.847 --> 01:45:33.932]  Now the other leg is the planned economy, which requires
[01:45:34.935 --> 01:45:36.056]  That's school to work!
[01:45:36.656 --> 01:45:44.180]  And the school to work needs the charter schools, the individual schools, which will train your children, not educate them.
[01:45:44.881 --> 01:45:47.723]  Now, folks, you've got to fight charter schools.
[01:45:47.743 --> 01:45:49.544]  Well, Charlotte, you're such a great lady.
[01:45:49.604 --> 01:45:54.366]  I mean, every time you come on, you desperately try to warn folks about the takeover, and that's important.
[01:45:54.667 --> 01:45:56.528]  The show ended last week, though.
[01:45:57.248 --> 01:45:59.290]  And I was unable to get you on the next take as you were busy.
[01:45:59.330 --> 01:46:02.052]  We've got you on this week and I'll hold you over a little bit.
[01:46:02.472 --> 01:46:04.053]  I'm sure Bob will be fine if we need to.
[01:46:04.914 --> 01:46:09.377]  But I mean, I'm always trying to learn more and understand all this.
[01:46:09.417 --> 01:46:09.978]  If you go back...
[01:46:10.987 --> 01:46:17.073]  Thirteen, fourteen years ago, I bought this mainline conservative propaganda that let folks have school choice.
[01:46:17.153 --> 01:46:23.319]  Well, they should at private schools, but not corporate funded, which is just the internationalization.
[01:46:23.359 --> 01:46:24.921]  They're now basically becoming the government.
[01:46:25.461 --> 01:46:28.485]  You know, wreck the old schools, federalize them, then offer the solution.
[01:46:28.505 --> 01:46:29.886]  Now I understand that.
[01:46:30.466 --> 01:46:31.107]  And also,
[01:46:32.508 --> 01:46:36.250]  I've interviewed people over the years and a few times heard them mention CMP.
[01:46:36.370 --> 01:46:38.291]  Okay, well Alex, let me talk about this.
[01:46:38.371 --> 01:46:39.652]  I'm going to give you a good example.
[01:46:39.672 --> 01:46:41.053]  You're down in Texas, okay?
[01:46:41.113 --> 01:46:41.353]  Yes.
[01:46:41.733 --> 01:46:44.554]  I realize that the CMP is just about as raw as it comes.
[01:46:44.574 --> 01:46:51.918]  They're funded by Heritage, funded by Correspondent, by all these... No, no, you're saying you ran into them, so I mean... Alright, now look.
[01:46:52.138 --> 01:46:53.439]  I'm going to tell you how it happened.
[01:46:54.179 --> 01:46:57.221]  About 15 years ago, I became very... I thought to myself,
[01:46:58.129 --> 01:47:02.092]  We've got to stop this agenda that's going in here, this merger, this whatever.
[01:47:02.192 --> 01:47:04.673]  And the only way we can do it, we have to get out of the UN.
[01:47:04.953 --> 01:47:21.144]  Because no matter how hard we fight on other issues, once we're under the North American Union, which is the same as the European Union, which Gorbachev calls the New European Soviet, once we're under, it won't make any difference if we have an amendment to outlaw abortion or gun controls or whatever.
[01:47:21.724 --> 01:47:24.425]  So, I dreamed up this little project.
[01:47:24.445 --> 01:47:25.945]  We have a postcard project.
[01:47:26.045 --> 01:47:34.328]  Millions of postcards all over the country which have on them legislation to get out of the U.N., who you call, websites, the rotten U.N.
[01:47:34.368 --> 01:47:35.808]  that has funded every U.N.
[01:47:35.908 --> 01:47:38.749]  war, that, I mean, controlled every U.N.
[01:47:38.809 --> 01:47:41.130]  war, or the Soviets are right up there at the U.N.
[01:47:41.170 --> 01:47:42.010]  controlling everything.
[01:47:42.030 --> 01:47:44.711]  That's why we lose all the bad stuff about the U.N.
[01:47:45.331 --> 01:48:00.685]  What we wanted to do is, we'd all have thousands of these little postcards, which we would send with bills, Christmas cards, put up on the bulletin board at the supermarket, put under windshield wipers, get out across the country.
[01:48:00.765 --> 01:48:07.110]  People call supporting legislation to get out of this one organization that controls everything.
[01:48:07.391 --> 01:48:12.035]  Now, so what we did, we downloaded the names of all the members of the CNP.
[01:48:13.181 --> 01:48:13.841]  300 of them.
[01:48:13.901 --> 01:48:16.042]  Samuels, my son, did it, who has American descent.
[01:48:16.062 --> 01:48:18.263]  Okay, tell folks who the CMP is.
[01:48:18.943 --> 01:48:23.004]  The Council for National Policy is the right-wing arm of the dialectic.
[01:48:23.504 --> 01:48:28.166]  It's the same as the CFR, and in fact, many of the people with the CFR funded it.
[01:48:28.246 --> 01:48:28.586]  Alright.
[01:48:28.746 --> 01:48:36.969]  Well, I mean, I've always heard the right call the CFR liberal, but, I mean, it's full-spectrum liberals and conservatives in the CFR.
[01:48:38.374 --> 01:48:43.157]  Oh yes, of course, and it's full spectrum liberals and conservatives in the Council for National Policy.
[01:48:59.085 --> 01:48:59.366]  Absolutely.
[01:49:18.709 --> 01:49:20.670]  Call up his publisher and say, I want to have him on about his book.
[01:49:21.010 --> 01:49:21.851]  Get him on and go after him.
[01:49:21.871 --> 01:49:22.691]  Doesn't mean I'm for him.
[01:49:22.711 --> 01:49:23.772]  I was against him in the interview.
[01:49:24.072 --> 01:49:29.315]  But then there's also a lot of people who've been in the CMP, like a Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, and he's grown.
[01:49:29.335 --> 01:49:30.415]  You know, he's learned things.
[01:49:30.815 --> 01:49:31.696]  I've talked to him about it.
[01:49:31.716 --> 01:49:33.297]  He just says it's basically ineffectual.
[01:49:33.857 --> 01:49:37.680]  Oh, that's not true at all.
[01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:40.123]  You didn't let me finish the end of it, Alex.
[01:49:40.143 --> 01:49:47.709]  The most important part is Rosalind Haley from Midland, Texas, who Ron Paul knows, we all know, is a great grand dame.
[01:49:48.069 --> 01:49:49.471]  She was a member of the CNP.
[01:49:50.451 --> 01:49:55.915]  And I had this project that I wanted to get going and I talked to Roz and she said, that's great.
[01:49:56.755 --> 01:49:58.016]  We tried to get help.
[01:49:58.396 --> 01:50:13.005]  So we sent a big yellow manila envelope full of clippings about Soviet tanks and training and all in the southern United States and exchanges and everything to every member of this Council for National Policy, which is made up of
[01:50:13.485 --> 01:50:19.449]  Top businessmen and the heads of all of the conservative groups in this country just about, okay?
[01:50:19.930 --> 01:50:22.432]  And we asked for help on this project.
[01:50:22.472 --> 01:50:25.514]  We wanted help on this Getting Out of the UN project.
[01:50:26.167 --> 01:50:28.248]  We, we got one response.
[01:50:28.368 --> 01:50:32.791]  I'll tell you, I didn't put my name on it because that's real mud.
[01:50:33.011 --> 01:50:35.752]  You know, I knew that they wouldn't do anything if they saw Isra Beat.
[01:50:36.112 --> 01:50:40.034]  So it was Roz Haley, the grand dame, the woman that they admired.
[01:50:40.354 --> 01:50:41.255]  She signed it.
[01:50:41.315 --> 01:50:42.155]  She sent it out.
[01:50:42.395 --> 01:50:45.397]  We got one response from Lou Sheldon at Traditional Values.
[01:50:45.797 --> 01:50:48.078]  We did not hear from anyone else.
[01:50:48.479 --> 01:50:50.680]  Now, if that doesn't tell your listeners,
[01:50:51.380 --> 01:50:55.784]  Stay away from every single conservative group you know.
[01:50:56.484 --> 01:50:56.825]  Stay there.
[01:50:56.845 --> 01:50:57.325]  We got a break.
[01:50:57.365 --> 01:50:58.566]  Come back and break it down for us.
[01:50:59.647 --> 01:51:00.928]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:00.968 --> 01:51:06.313]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:06.553 --> 01:51:11.177]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:11.577 --> 01:51:11.958]  It's true.
[01:51:12.038 --> 01:51:14.620]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[01:51:14.860 --> 01:51:16.602]  And it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:51:17.122 --> 01:51:21.825]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:22.346 --> 01:51:24.287]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:51:24.667 --> 01:51:29.270]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:29.470 --> 01:51:30.371]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:30.591 --> 01:51:33.353]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:51:33.653 --> 01:51:36.955]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:37.276 --> 01:51:40.117]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:51:40.458 --> 01:51:42.359]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:51:42.679 --> 01:51:43.600]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:51:47.262 --> 01:51:50.945]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:51.485 --> 01:51:55.989]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:56.309 --> 01:51:58.751]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:51:59.131 --> 01:51:59.492]  Hello!
[01:51:59.812 --> 01:52:04.215]  At OfTheField.com, we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.
[01:52:04.555 --> 01:52:09.059]  We get lots of amazing positive feedback, most of which we feature on OfTheField.com.
[01:52:09.379 --> 01:52:14.163]  Here's a small sample of all that people like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[01:52:14.503 --> 01:52:18.424]  It's inspiring for many who are affected by the recent downturn of the economy.
[01:52:18.584 --> 01:52:22.524]  I already knew a bit about foraging and edibles, but you take it to a whole new level.
[01:52:22.644 --> 01:52:25.165]  A thousand thanks to you for all that great knowledge.
[01:52:25.425 --> 01:52:26.345]  It was empowering.
[01:52:26.465 --> 01:52:30.346]  When I was in the Navy, I went through a couple of quick land survival classes.
[01:52:30.446 --> 01:52:33.246]  Thank you for being an inspiration and for all the work that you do.
[01:52:33.266 --> 01:52:36.007]  I really appreciate the depth and detail of the information.
[01:52:36.127 --> 01:52:36.947]  Thank you so much.
[01:52:37.107 --> 01:52:39.907]  Much love and respect to you from all of us here in the boonies.
[01:52:39.967 --> 01:52:40.547]  Thanks again.
[01:52:40.707 --> 01:52:43.308]  Knowledge is power, and that power brings peace.
[01:52:44.065 --> 01:52:47.087]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.

[01:54:07.093 --> 01:54:09.513]  In just a few days, Charlotte's going to leave the country for three months.
[01:54:09.533 --> 01:54:13.294]  So I twisted her arm to get her back on, and now she's like, I need more time to cover all this.
[01:54:13.314 --> 01:54:14.895]  We got Bob Chapman coming up.
[01:54:15.455 --> 01:54:19.896]  So I'm glad you're here to discuss it with us, because I'm trying to understand all these different organizations and groups.
[01:54:19.916 --> 01:54:21.336]  Now let's get back to the CMP.
[01:54:21.376 --> 01:54:23.196]  So the break stopped you.
[01:54:23.216 --> 01:54:28.037]  You were saying she sent this grand dame of the group, or the organization.
[01:54:28.437 --> 01:54:31.438]  She sends them the information, and then she gets one response back.
[01:54:32.110 --> 01:54:34.751]  Yeah, we sent it to all 300 members.
[01:54:34.771 --> 01:54:40.394]  And Rosalyn Haley, from Midland, Texas, close to Ron Paul and all that, you probably know her.
[01:54:40.414 --> 01:54:43.416]  Her husband wrote the best book in the world on Lyndon Johnson.
[01:54:44.036 --> 01:54:44.816]  Evan Haley.
[01:54:44.896 --> 01:54:51.100]  Anyway, Rosalyn, who was a great American, and she died a few years ago.
[01:54:51.420 --> 01:54:53.241]  She and I, this was our project.
[01:54:53.401 --> 01:54:55.822]  And so, I don't need to say any more, do I?
[01:54:56.282 --> 01:55:01.725]  I mean, we get one response from 300 people who tell us they're trying to save the United States.
[01:55:02.566 --> 01:55:12.317]  That's the goal of the CMP to save the United States for our children, to clean up education, to take care of taxes, and what a big bunch of you-know-what!
[01:55:13.203 --> 01:55:13.523]  Boy!
[01:55:14.844 --> 01:55:20.889]  So again, from your perspective, a brief history of the CMP and where are they in the power structure from your research?
[01:55:21.050 --> 01:55:25.013]  Well, I mean, you have Paul Wyrick, oh it's very important that he died recently.
[01:55:25.353 --> 01:55:35.101]  He was the initial head of the Heritage Foundation and then he had his family research council and then you've got Paul, you've got Edwin Fulner who came on as the head of the
[01:55:36.022 --> 01:55:40.566]  Heritage Foundation later, and then you've got all the other conservative organizations.
[01:55:40.586 --> 01:55:55.058]  You've got, you know, these are people that I've worked with and like, so I don't even like to talk about them, but people like, you know, Howard Phillips and, uh, oh, James Dobson, but, but I have to say, and LaHaye, Beverly LaHaye and Kim LaHaye, uh, I'll tell you.
[01:55:55.158 --> 01:55:56.319]  What about Phyllis Schlafly?
[01:55:56.359 --> 01:55:57.400]  I mean, is she New World Order?
[01:55:57.420 --> 01:56:00.943]  Phyllis Schlafly, who I know very, very well and have worked with for ages.
[01:56:01.483 --> 01:56:03.785]  It's not much fun for me to talk about these people.
[01:56:03.825 --> 01:56:05.787]  So, I mean, are they consciously bad?
[01:56:06.048 --> 01:56:07.749]  Well, it's very hard to say.
[01:56:07.789 --> 01:56:09.351]  I have to say something for Phyllis.
[01:56:09.471 --> 01:56:15.857]  Although, unfortunately, she has really been, and I've worked with her on this, she's been on the wrong side with charter schools.
[01:56:15.877 --> 01:56:17.359]  She's never seemed to get it.
[01:56:17.999 --> 01:56:22.601]  But I have to give her credit on the Constitutional Convention.
[01:56:23.161 --> 01:56:29.844]  Nobody has done better work to keep us from having a Constitutional Convention than Phyllis Schlafly.
[01:56:31.205 --> 01:56:33.886]  Don't ask me why she can be so good on that.
[01:56:34.606 --> 01:56:44.310]  And then support charter schools, which are going to be the vehicle which will bring this country down into the planned economy with unelected boards.
[01:56:46.972 --> 01:56:58.581]  No, but that's my issue, is that I know the CFR is bad, but a lot of their members are mid-level, they're brought in to be co-opted and controlled.
[01:56:59.101 --> 01:57:07.288]  I, from my research, do believe that, I don't know if it was founded good or got taken over, but certainly the CMP goes along with the whole neocon agenda and is bad.
[01:57:07.308 --> 01:57:11.191]  I just get emails saying, you know, cover the CMP, so I've done research on it.
[01:57:11.391 --> 01:57:16.392]  It's funded by Rockefeller and Scape Mellon and all, same as Heritage.
[01:57:16.552 --> 01:57:32.336]  And really, wait a minute, do you think that the Rockefellers, well they do fund everything, both sides, but they knew, they had, they set up this conservative think tank, the CMP sort of, and all the conservative organizations belong to it, plus corporate sector.
[01:57:32.936 --> 01:57:33.917]  No, I know they set up.
[01:57:33.957 --> 01:57:34.397]  Here it is.
[01:57:34.437 --> 01:57:36.099]  You're saying you're sure they set it up?
[01:57:36.159 --> 01:57:37.460]  Wow, then it's purely bad then.
[01:57:37.740 --> 01:57:38.641]  Yes!
[01:57:38.721 --> 01:57:47.589]  And what I want you to do, because I'm not the expert on this, but I've told you, Alex, you must interview Kelly Nelson and Shea Simonton.
[01:57:47.609 --> 01:57:50.391]  These are brilliant gals who are out there.
[01:57:50.431 --> 01:57:53.234]  Nobody ever heard of them because nobody wants anybody to hear of them.
[01:57:53.254 --> 01:57:54.115]  Well, I'll tell you who...
[01:57:55.996 --> 01:57:56.396]  Talk to you
[01:58:13.664 --> 01:58:19.766]  In a two-part interview on this subject and other subjects, how the neocons control the conservative movement.
[01:58:19.786 --> 01:58:33.109]  That video's going up on PrisonPlanet.tv either tomorrow or... Well, that's terribly important and I'm glad you're doing that, but what I want people to understand, I want to reduce this to the level where people... Look... Alright, stay there.
[01:58:33.149 --> 01:58:34.210]  Back in 60 seconds.
[01:58:34.650 --> 01:58:35.230]  Back in 60 seconds.
[01:58:35.270 --> 01:58:37.010]  We'll have five more minutes ahead of Bob Chapman.
[01:58:37.030 --> 01:58:37.410]  Stay with us.
[01:58:39.731 --> 01:58:40.271]  On air.
[01:58:41.091 --> 01:58:41.772]  Online.
[01:58:42.572 --> 01:58:42.712]  And...
[01:58:44.162 --> 01:58:48.443]  On demand, we are the GCN Radio Network.

[01:59:47.802 --> 01:59:48.222]  Thank you.
[01:59:52.404 --> 01:59:54.345]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:54.785 --> 01:59:57.566]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:04.127 --> 02:00:08.330]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:08.970 --> 02:00:09.770]  You want answers?
[02:00:10.551 --> 02:00:11.471]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.092 --> 02:00:15.674]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.274 --> 02:00:20.397]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.979 --> 02:00:26.180]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:00:26.240 --> 02:00:27.141]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:00:27.161 --> 02:00:29.122]  We've got five minutes left with Charlotte Isserby.
[02:00:30.604 --> 02:00:36.387]  And we've got a report coming out that gets into how the conservative movement's controlled.
[02:00:36.427 --> 02:00:40.989]  We've, of course, covered that a lot in the past from the Council on Foreign Relations that is bipartisan.
[02:00:41.509 --> 02:00:46.011]  But also how the establishment tried to go in and control the anti-New World Order movement.
[02:00:46.371 --> 02:00:48.872]  And that is this full-spectrum dominance system.
[02:00:50.310 --> 02:00:59.459]  Nothing can stop you, as the American people, from going out and running for office yourself, and sticking to the issues, and not being co-opted.
[02:00:59.719 --> 02:01:01.400]  There's been an attempt to co-opt the Tea Party.
[02:01:01.461 --> 02:01:04.003]  It's been somewhat successful, but not overall.
[02:01:04.543 --> 02:01:13.051]  And that's why we're getting major traction, because of people like Charlotte Isserby over the years, and Dr. Stan Monteith, and countless others fighting the good fight against tyranny.
[02:01:15.458 --> 02:01:17.179]  You said you wanted to boil this down, Charlotte.
[02:01:17.419 --> 02:01:33.027]  Well, Alex, I just want to ask your listeners there, how can they trust the Council for National Policy to do what they want them to do, which means every single conservative organization you've ever heard of belongs to that group.
[02:01:33.997 --> 02:01:56.153]  If we send out a letter to every single president of that particular group in order to get, asking them to help us get out of the most important entity which is going to take us down into a Soviet system, which is the UN, which was founded by communists, how can we trust these groups when they don't even answer
[02:01:56.813 --> 02:01:57.154]  I don't
[02:02:12.817 --> 02:02:15.559]  The infiltration is complete across the board.
[02:02:15.919 --> 02:02:28.889]  And remember, I mean I'm not talking about CMP funding as much as others, because CMP is all the different groups, but the Heritage Foundation was funded by Richard Mellonscape.
[02:02:29.549 --> 02:02:32.130]  That's Chase Mellon Bank and Rockefeller.
[02:02:32.570 --> 02:02:37.031]  They gave them $900,000 to get it off the ground.
[02:02:37.051 --> 02:02:38.171]  No, I knew that.
[02:02:38.231 --> 02:02:39.111]  I've seen the proof of that.
[02:02:40.412 --> 02:02:42.772]  I haven't seen the proof of the John Byrne Society.
[02:02:43.052 --> 02:02:44.492]  I've seen people claim that.
[02:02:44.552 --> 02:02:44.893]  I know.
[02:02:45.033 --> 02:02:46.333]  I haven't really seen it either.
[02:02:46.393 --> 02:02:48.273]  And if I do, I try not to believe it.
[02:02:48.333 --> 02:02:49.994]  But anyway... Charlotte, here's an example.
[02:02:50.074 --> 02:02:50.634]  People say...
[02:02:51.907 --> 02:02:55.150]  We're owned by ABC at Genesis.
[02:02:55.170 --> 02:03:02.577]  To be on talk radio, we've rented probably over the years 15 or more different satellites.
[02:03:02.677 --> 02:03:04.659]  Anybody can go rent a feed on a satellite.
[02:03:04.900 --> 02:03:06.881]  That's how a gardening show gets syndicated.
[02:03:07.142 --> 02:03:07.882]  It's not true.
[02:03:08.383 --> 02:03:11.686]  Or they say some guy from Saudi Arabia owns us with no proof.
[02:03:12.847 --> 02:03:15.710]  And so my experience is I've gotten a little more seasoned in all of this.
[02:03:17.011 --> 02:03:17.632]  Well, I sure did!
[02:03:38.408 --> 02:03:40.889]  I mean, I've been disappointed all the way down the line.
[02:03:40.909 --> 02:03:44.851]  I mean, Ronald Reagan, uh, don't get me, don't get me on that subject.
[02:03:44.891 --> 02:03:46.811]  People should try to go buy that book.
[02:03:47.532 --> 02:03:49.112]  Uh, here's the rest of him.
[02:03:49.432 --> 02:03:50.613]  Go try to buy that book.
[02:03:50.653 --> 02:03:52.714]  It sells for $100 and they can't get it.
[02:03:52.734 --> 02:03:55.255]  That's what he was like as governor.
[02:03:55.495 --> 02:03:56.955]  We were taken to the cleaners.
[02:03:57.435 --> 02:03:59.016]  Absolutely taken to the cleaners by him.
[02:03:59.296 --> 02:04:03.858]  But the most important thing now, folks, is the Heritage Foundation affiliates.
[02:04:04.523 --> 02:04:04.923]  We're good.
[02:04:21.877 --> 02:04:26.719]  Yeah, regional government putting it all under federal, the international, amazing.
[02:04:38.484 --> 02:04:45.351]  But it's going in right now, and you have to go after the heritage affiliate in your state.
[02:04:45.491 --> 02:04:52.139]  You find out what that affiliate is, and you go up against them, and they're funding us money to get cars for them.
[02:04:52.199 --> 02:04:53.640]  Alright, Bob Chapman's holding.
[02:04:53.840 --> 02:04:58.505]  Bob Chapman's holding, but I'm gonna hold you over and let you finish and then get Bob's take on what you've said.
[02:04:59.346 --> 02:05:03.589]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:05:03.909 --> 02:05:04.509]  Number 1.
[02:05:04.809 --> 02:05:07.971]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:08.232 --> 02:05:08.792]  Number 2.
[02:05:09.092 --> 02:05:13.655]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:05:13.995 --> 02:05:14.436]  It's true.
[02:05:14.736 --> 02:05:19.299]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:19.599 --> 02:05:20.139]  Number 3.
[02:05:20.439 --> 02:05:23.721]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:05:24.022 --> 02:05:27.724]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:05:27.924 --> 02:05:28.484]  Number four.
[02:05:28.704 --> 02:05:31.085]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:05:31.465 --> 02:05:34.866]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:05:35.146 --> 02:05:35.706]  Number five.
[02:05:35.946 --> 02:05:39.867]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:05:40.087 --> 02:05:44.849]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:05:45.149 --> 02:05:49.170]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[02:05:59.113 --> 02:06:02.795]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[02:06:02.955 --> 02:06:06.998]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[02:06:07.238 --> 02:06:12.021]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[02:06:12.141 --> 02:06:17.124]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[02:06:17.884 --> 02:06:21.066]  Not worried about them moving south.
[02:06:21.146 --> 02:06:24.868]  Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[02:06:27.829 --> 02:06:34.477]  We're American and be proud.

[02:06:59.534 --> 02:07:02.135]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:07:02.555 --> 02:07:07.518]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:07:07.878 --> 02:07:09.598]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:07:09.919 --> 02:07:14.741]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:07:14.921 --> 02:07:15.881]  How much do you want?
[02:07:16.101 --> 02:07:16.842]  When do you want it?
[02:07:17.222 --> 02:07:18.823]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:07:19.103 --> 02:07:19.943]  When will you need it?
[02:07:20.183 --> 02:07:22.244]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:07:22.384 --> 02:07:23.485]  Will there be any food?
[02:07:23.725 --> 02:07:24.325]  Will it make your
[02:07:24.465 --> 02:07:24.845]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:07:43.166 --> 02:07:45.928]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:07:46.228 --> 02:07:46.568]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[02:07:46.748 --> 02:07:48.389]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:07:48.409 --> 02:07:49.490]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:07:49.530 --> 02:07:50.791]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:07:50.811 --> 02:07:52.452]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:10.410 --> 02:08:13.371]  Alright, Bob Chapman with us throughout the rest of the hour.
[02:08:14.452 --> 02:08:17.253]  We have some other very important news we're going to be going over.
[02:08:17.273 --> 02:08:21.395]  The federal government's saying the Mexican drug cartels are recruiting people domestically.
[02:08:21.935 --> 02:08:22.855]  Of course they are!
[02:08:23.175 --> 02:08:24.536]  And they're buying off the police!
[02:08:25.016 --> 02:08:28.758]  And once corruption reaches a certain level, we'll start falling apart like Mexico.
[02:08:29.318 --> 02:08:30.659]  That's all part of the globalist plan.
[02:08:30.719 --> 02:08:31.980]  That's in the North American Union.
[02:08:32.500 --> 02:08:34.662]  SPP meetings that Bush and others signed in.
[02:08:35.242 --> 02:08:40.325]  And so you'll hear George Bush, you know, criticizing globalism and then he gets in as a big globalist.
[02:08:40.545 --> 02:08:45.349]  You'll hear, you know, constant pushes for things.
[02:08:45.609 --> 02:08:49.992]  Ronald Reagan was campaigning against the Trilateral Commission and George Herbert Walker Bush.
[02:08:50.532 --> 02:08:51.855]  But then he caved into that.
[02:08:53.077 --> 02:08:59.610]  And I mean, that's why we have to understand the reason I'm getting into this now is I'm making a film.
[02:09:01.052 --> 02:09:10.540]  Dealing with puppets and politics and things like that, and a eugenics film, and another film, and I've got all these interviews and all this material, I'm not even sure which one I'm going to put out.
[02:09:10.560 --> 02:09:12.482]  I've got to get on it though.
[02:09:13.082 --> 02:09:22.591]  But more and more, we're getting ahead of, just like we told you what Obama would do from the left attack of the New World Order, now we're getting everybody ready for the full Republican takeover.
[02:09:22.871 --> 02:09:28.536]  Because if we don't understand how they operate and educate people, we won't be able to hold their feet to the fire.
[02:09:28.996 --> 02:09:33.979]  But we're getting, for the first time, real toeholds with forcing things through here.
[02:09:34.900 --> 02:09:36.941]  And we can repeal the No Child Left Behind.
[02:09:37.341 --> 02:09:40.143]  We can repeal, which was a federal takeover, we can repeal the health care.
[02:09:40.463 --> 02:09:41.784]  We can get out of UNESCO.
[02:09:41.824 --> 02:09:44.006]  They just got rid of the Global Warming Committee yesterday.
[02:09:44.366 --> 02:09:46.988]  I mean, we can kick their hind ends if we believe it.
[02:09:49.369 --> 02:09:54.992]  I wanted to bring Bob Chapman in because he was listening for five minutes on hold to you covering all of this.
[02:09:55.673 --> 02:10:07.359]  Bob, what's your take on all these pyramid power structures, CFR with the left and right, CMP, the neocon arm of it to co-opt the conservative groups and kind of get them under control?
[02:10:07.699 --> 02:10:09.601]  The Royal Institute of International Affairs in England.
[02:10:09.842 --> 02:10:12.164]  From my research, everything is in pyramid power structures.
[02:10:12.184 --> 02:10:14.747]  That's why the New World Order symbol is a pyramid.
[02:10:24.904 --> 02:10:28.767]  At the bottom of these organizations, most people think they're operating in a good cause.
[02:10:28.787 --> 02:10:30.588]  Like, local cops think they're actually fighting terrorists.
[02:10:30.988 --> 02:10:39.714]  But as you go up, the need to know gets less and less compartmentalized until you hit the top of the pyramid of the CFR or any of these groups.
[02:10:39.734 --> 02:10:40.655]  They have them all over the world.
[02:10:41.375 --> 02:10:49.838]  Then you find out this pyramid nexuses in to other pyramidal power structures, and that's the management system of the world.
[02:10:50.059 --> 02:10:57.661]  That's why if you go out and tell Masons they're involved in occultic activities, the average Mason isn't involved in that, so then you're discredited because they're compartmentalized.
[02:10:57.942 --> 02:11:04.744]  Or you go and explain to a good Catholic person who's anti-abortion, great American, that the Catholic Church is promoting world government now at the top.
[02:11:05.224 --> 02:11:06.845]  Not Catholic bashing, it's that it is.
[02:11:07.145 --> 02:11:08.986]  Or that major Protestant groups are promoting it.
[02:11:09.386 --> 02:11:09.986]  I don't know.
[02:11:31.019 --> 02:11:43.753]  Uh, you know, from what I've researched is things like the CFR, CMP, that's why the CFR has, you know, thousands of members, is they're bringing people in to try to influence them, to try to see who they can get to work in the system.
[02:11:43.773 --> 02:11:46.035]  And if they don't, they get kicked out or stay low.
[02:11:46.376 --> 02:11:49.760]  If they say yes, they move up the power structure.
[02:11:49.780 --> 02:11:51.461]  But then I've seen people unfairly claim
[02:11:52.042 --> 02:11:53.524]  Because I don't know if she's evil or not.
[02:11:53.564 --> 02:11:56.968]  I know Brad Pitt's seen my films, and I'm gonna leave it at that, and likes them.
[02:11:57.709 --> 02:12:03.916]  But, you know, to say Angelina Jolie is evil without proof, though she made some Illuminati movies, I tend to not like her and don't trust her.
[02:12:04.957 --> 02:12:07.180]  And I know Bono is involved with the Rockefellers.
[02:12:07.940 --> 02:12:11.625]  I know he's now is a front of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and is evil.
[02:12:11.965 --> 02:12:18.593]  It takes me time to research something before I can 100% say, you know, the whole thing is rotten to the core.
[02:12:19.554 --> 02:12:24.699]  But I mean, overall, I'm just trying to give people my own view on how I analyze things and understand things.
[02:12:24.980 --> 02:12:26.762]  You've been in the anti-New World Order movement.
[02:12:27.402 --> 02:12:31.063]  For close to 50 years, Bob Chapman, you've been basically driven out of the U.S.
[02:12:31.403 --> 02:12:37.324]  with, you know, assassination attempts and people trying to plant hand grenades on you and all the rest of it.
[02:12:37.364 --> 02:12:41.865]  But I know you were there putting out Gary Allen, None Dare Call a Conspiracy, doing such yeoman work.
[02:12:42.165 --> 02:12:44.985]  You know a lot of these CMP people, I would imagine.
[02:12:45.465 --> 02:12:46.386]  What's your view on it?
[02:12:46.746 --> 02:12:48.146]  And what's your view of what Charlotte's saying?
[02:12:49.366 --> 02:12:51.187]  Well, she's right, and it's perpetual.
[02:12:51.827 --> 02:12:52.507]  They don't give up.
[02:12:52.567 --> 02:12:53.227]  They never stop.
[02:12:54.156 --> 02:12:59.360]  And as you say, if someone goes along with the program after they recruit them, that's all fine and good.
[02:12:59.420 --> 02:13:03.363]  If not, they shunt to the side or they leave or whatever.
[02:13:04.204 --> 02:13:10.149]  And we went through these change agents during the 60s and 70s.
[02:13:11.730 --> 02:13:12.851]  They are planted.
[02:13:13.371 --> 02:13:14.732]  There's absolutely no question.
[02:13:15.153 --> 02:13:19.056]  I mean, we even had them planted in gun clubs, if you can believe that.
[02:13:19.876 --> 02:13:23.199]  And we were able to identify them.
[02:13:23.943 --> 02:13:25.004]  And isolate them.
[02:13:27.426 --> 02:13:36.494]  Charlotte doesn't know this, but I was involved in the first gubernatorial race that Ronald Reagan was in.
[02:13:37.395 --> 02:13:40.858]  And I know a great deal about him for a lot of reasons.
[02:13:41.839 --> 02:13:47.104]  And I know a lot of things that I'll never say on radio because they get me killed.
[02:13:49.557 --> 02:13:51.258]  They'll start really looking for me.
[02:13:51.438 --> 02:13:55.439]  And you haven't told me about this stuff, just like I told the DC Madam off air.
[02:13:55.479 --> 02:13:57.800]  I said, do not tell me anything that's not on air.
[02:13:57.900 --> 02:14:00.120]  I don't, we're all being listened to right now.
[02:14:00.560 --> 02:14:02.821]  If you're not going to put it out there, Bob, in fact, I wouldn't.
[02:14:03.141 --> 02:14:04.061]  Well, now you've said it.
[02:14:04.081 --> 02:14:05.462]  You pretty much got to say it now.
[02:14:05.482 --> 02:14:08.982]  This is going to be shocking.
[02:14:10.743 --> 02:14:12.163]  Ronald Reagan was a homosexual.
[02:14:17.649 --> 02:14:24.633]  Besides the fact that during the late 1930s and early 40s, he was making what we would call today pro-communist speeches.
[02:14:25.674 --> 02:14:26.574]  Well, that's on record.
[02:14:26.614 --> 02:14:31.837]  I mean, they spun that that he was young and woke up later and became a conservative.
[02:14:33.178 --> 02:14:35.179]  Well, it all goes.
[02:14:36.740 --> 02:14:43.043]  It was part of the reason that he had as many roles as he had in the movies, because he really wasn't a very good actor.
[02:14:45.497 --> 02:14:47.941]  I know him quite well, and he was a nice enough guy.
[02:14:48.702 --> 02:14:51.547]  But he didn't know what I know about him, and I never told him.
[02:14:51.647 --> 02:14:53.590]  So he basically just did whatever he was told.
[02:14:54.776 --> 02:14:55.657]  Absolutely.
[02:14:55.697 --> 02:15:04.462]  Why did the Bushes, and for those that don't know, the Hinckley's having dinner with them, the whole setup, and it takes hours to get into it, but anybody just get into George H.W.
[02:15:04.502 --> 02:15:09.045]  Bush attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan, just search that and spend a week reading it.
[02:15:09.405 --> 02:15:15.289]  I mean, Bob, correct me if I'm wrong, but they tried to kill Reagan, so if he was totally bad, why did they try to kill him?
[02:15:16.790 --> 02:15:19.192]  Well, do you really want to do an assassination with a .22?
[02:15:23.240 --> 02:15:24.941]  Well not only that, I don't think it was the intent to kill him.
[02:15:24.961 --> 02:15:27.503]  I think the intention was to shoot him and scare him and have him do what they wanted him to do.
[02:15:45.799 --> 02:15:58.202]  You know, after his election... Yeah, because I've also talked to people that knew Reagan well, and they said that, yes, he was just a kind of an opportunist and stuff, but he really didn't kind of like the new world order by the time he became president, and he didn't like George H.W.
[02:15:58.242 --> 02:15:58.422]  Bush.
[02:15:58.442 --> 02:15:59.363]  We know that was true.
[02:15:59.583 --> 02:16:00.783]  He criticized him over that.
[02:16:01.003 --> 02:16:03.644]  So, I mean, was there just a rivalry between the two?
[02:16:04.024 --> 02:16:06.505]  Or was... I mean, I don't want to just say Reagan was a pure devil.
[02:16:06.965 --> 02:16:09.645]  I don't like... What's your take, Bob Chapman?
[02:16:10.786 --> 02:16:15.147]  Well, you know, Bush wasn't physically on the scene.
[02:16:15.916 --> 02:16:26.844]  At that time, he evolved more as a person within the Central Intelligence Agency, several years after Reagan's first election.
[02:16:27.885 --> 02:16:28.546]  That came in the 70s.
[02:16:29.702 --> 02:16:33.967]  I don't know what that rivalry was, because I wasn't close to the situation at that time.
[02:16:33.987 --> 02:16:38.192]  You're talking about his election as governor, not as president in 19- Yes, that's right.
[02:16:38.432 --> 02:16:41.295]  So I was in at the beginning, so to speak.
[02:16:41.616 --> 02:16:46.141]  Well, now that you've said this incredibly dangerous thing, and I don't doubt you, Bob, you're not somebody I've ever heard
[02:16:47.222 --> 02:16:52.746]  Feed people lies or baloney and I'm actually few things actually kind of give me a pang of fear like standing at the edge of a cliff.
[02:16:53.006 --> 02:16:57.509]  I'm pretty freaked out right now and not even judging Reagan if he was like that.
[02:16:57.809 --> 02:17:00.111]  It just freaks me out the power of that knowledge.
[02:17:00.471 --> 02:17:08.756]  I mean, I mean, I do know that you are a conservative icon and did run with a lot of the big guys because you were wealthy and lived in California and were politically involved.
[02:17:08.796 --> 02:17:10.418]  Maybe that's why they've always been after you since.
[02:17:10.478 --> 02:17:11.939]  But I mean, you have you.
[02:17:12.259 --> 02:17:14.200]  I mean, what did you witness with Reagan?
[02:17:14.320 --> 02:17:15.601]  I mean, this is dangerous stuff.
[02:17:15.841 --> 02:17:17.102]  We might as well just get this out now.
[02:17:19.563 --> 02:17:26.387]  I saw a film and I was also told by his girlfriend before he married Nancy.
[02:17:27.588 --> 02:17:32.010]  Oh man, this is making me sick right now.
[02:17:32.110 --> 02:17:33.691]  And by sick, it's just making me sick.
[02:17:33.711 --> 02:17:36.693]  There's only a handful of people left who know this.
[02:17:37.774 --> 02:17:39.435]  Most of them are now deceased.
[02:17:40.095 --> 02:17:45.298]  There's one that is alive that I know of that knew this.
[02:17:47.806 --> 02:17:50.507]  But I also got it from another source.
[02:17:50.807 --> 02:17:51.447]  Earlier on.
[02:17:51.767 --> 02:17:53.647]  You were with Defense Intelligence, correct?
[02:17:53.687 --> 02:17:55.508]  But previously in Berlin?
[02:17:57.048 --> 02:17:57.268]  No.
[02:17:58.168 --> 02:17:58.948]  I was in Germany.
[02:17:59.828 --> 02:18:01.749]  But quite frankly, I was never in Berlin.
[02:18:02.809 --> 02:18:04.389]  And they wouldn't let me go to Berlin.
[02:18:05.729 --> 02:18:08.610]  Unless they flew me in, and there was no reason to do that.
[02:18:09.090 --> 02:18:11.010]  In what context did you see this film?
[02:18:11.290 --> 02:18:13.891]  The film I saw
[02:18:16.221 --> 02:18:17.321]  At a private showing.
[02:18:18.241 --> 02:18:20.402]  And most of the people who were there, I didn't even know.
[02:18:21.642 --> 02:18:23.663]  And it was by invitation only.
[02:18:26.983 --> 02:18:30.364]  Was this a group of conservatives freaked out by it, or was this people wanting to blackmail him?
[02:18:30.404 --> 02:18:32.744]  No, I think it was quite a cross-section of people.
[02:18:34.125 --> 02:18:37.805]  And, um... And that's where I saw it.
[02:18:37.845 --> 02:18:41.726]  But I learned before that, that that was the case.
[02:18:43.207 --> 02:18:45.047]  And, um... From the girlfriend?
[02:18:46.016 --> 02:18:46.516]  That's right.
[02:18:47.257 --> 02:18:48.958]  And I don't know whether she's still alive or not.
[02:18:49.959 --> 02:18:54.162]  She would probably be in her late 80s or 90s now.
[02:18:55.503 --> 02:18:56.804]  And probably late 80s.
[02:18:56.864 --> 02:18:59.206]  Okay, well this is obviously very dangerous right now, Bob.
[02:18:59.266 --> 02:19:02.348]  So, was this a porno tape or just him holding hands with a guy?
[02:19:02.368 --> 02:19:02.849]  What was this?
[02:19:04.610 --> 02:19:04.990]  No, no.
[02:19:08.692 --> 02:19:17.115]  I don't know whether I should talk about the way it happened on air, but... Well, they're gonna probably come kill you and maybe me if you don't, so just get it all out right now.
[02:19:18.235 --> 02:19:28.999]  The film was a woman with him who used an artificial device to do what they did.
[02:19:30.599 --> 02:19:33.260]  Had this been taped covertly by an intelligence agency?
[02:19:34.654 --> 02:19:38.776]  I was trained covertly, but not by an intelligence agency.
[02:19:39.096 --> 02:19:42.278]  Oh, so he was a... Well, that doesn't necessarily mean he's homosexual, then.
[02:19:42.918 --> 02:19:45.700]  But it does... That's par for the course with these politicians.
[02:19:45.740 --> 02:19:47.240]  That is just unbelievable news.
[02:19:48.241 --> 02:19:48.821]  Unbelievable.
[02:19:48.861 --> 02:19:50.342]  I actually wish I wouldn't have asked.
[02:19:50.402 --> 02:19:52.083]  I thought it was going to be something like drugs or something.
[02:19:52.903 --> 02:19:55.205]  Okay, this show is really taking a crazy turn.
[02:19:55.625 --> 02:19:56.725]  Charlotte, Bob, stay there.
[02:19:56.785 --> 02:19:57.826]  I'm pretty freaked out right now.
[02:20:01.581 --> 02:20:02.701]  This is not a drill.
[02:20:02.801 --> 02:20:04.782]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[02:20:05.302 --> 02:20:06.902]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[02:20:07.202 --> 02:20:14.323]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[02:20:14.423 --> 02:20:18.764]  Now, a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[02:20:18.804 --> 02:20:29.126]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them, how to create the perfect hiding place, as well as the places you should never hide your guns.
[02:20:29.326 --> 02:20:30.867]  Under any circumstance.
[02:20:30.947 --> 02:20:37.831]  These and other closely guarded gun caching secrets are guaranteed to keep your weapons safe and out of sight when the going gets tough.
[02:20:38.171 --> 02:20:38.832]  But listen up.
[02:20:38.852 --> 02:20:45.055]  For security reasons, the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time.
[02:20:45.115 --> 02:20:46.916]  Go to hideyourguns.com.
[02:20:46.956 --> 02:20:49.038]  That's hideyourguns.com.
[02:20:49.118 --> 02:20:49.598]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[02:20:49.618 --> 02:20:51.459]  Before they come for your guns.
[02:20:51.499 --> 02:20:52.059]  Hideyourguns.com.
[02:20:52.119 --> 02:20:52.700]  Right now.
[02:21:00.436 --> 02:21:04.060]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:21:04.440 --> 02:21:07.443]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:21:07.704 --> 02:21:12.469]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:21:12.489 --> 02:21:18.735]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:21:18.875 --> 02:21:21.118]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:21:21.638 --> 02:21:21.938]  Tim Geithner?
[02:21:21.958 --> 02:21:22.378]  Bernanke?
[02:21:22.459 --> 02:21:23.079]  They're arsonists!
[02:21:23.139 --> 02:21:24.520]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:21:24.540 --> 02:21:26.661]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:21:40.549 --> 02:21:47.491]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.
[02:21:47.831 --> 02:21:56.934]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv

[02:23:28.055 --> 02:23:37.321]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:23:37.381 --> 02:23:38.122]  This capitalism?
[02:23:38.182 --> 02:23:44.326]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:23:44.446 --> 02:23:45.267]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[02:23:45.327 --> 02:23:48.429]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[02:23:48.589 --> 02:23:49.349]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[02:23:49.369 --> 02:23:50.730]  It's time to understand the system.

[02:24:09.881 --> 02:24:20.927]  Well, I thought it was going to be Ronald Reagan was a communist.
[02:24:21.067 --> 02:24:25.030]  I've seen a lot of mainline books say that, well, he did get into it a little bit, but he woke up to it.
[02:24:25.290 --> 02:24:25.810]  And that's fine.
[02:24:25.850 --> 02:24:26.891]  People do stuff when they're young.
[02:24:27.771 --> 02:24:30.532]  I mean, that's where I thought Bob Chappell would go with this.
[02:24:31.433 --> 02:24:38.595]  But then I was talking to Charlotte during the break and she said, well, I don't know anything about that specifically, but I had heard those rumors, but no proof.
[02:24:38.615 --> 02:24:41.917]  But she said, you know, basically look at the log cabin Republican stuff.
[02:24:41.957 --> 02:24:42.777]  Look at Bohemian Grove.
[02:24:42.797 --> 02:24:44.578]  What did Richard Nixon say about it?
[02:24:45.058 --> 02:24:49.282]  And I don't sit here and judge people and attack people and hate people.
[02:24:50.002 --> 02:24:55.707]  My issue is they can compromise you when they have that type of stuff on you.
[02:24:56.348 --> 02:25:00.892]  And Charlotte, we're about to go back to Bob, but anything else you want to say on the subject?
[02:25:00.932 --> 02:25:04.615]  I mean, you said that when you were in the administration you'd heard things like this, or what'd you hear?
[02:25:04.835 --> 02:25:06.096]  Oh no, no, no, no.
[02:25:06.376 --> 02:25:27.647]  I've just heard, you know, because I talk to a lot of people, all types of people, people who don't have proof, people who do, and I heard that rumor floating around and I just rejected it because basically that's not, I'm not concerned, I mean maybe I should be, but I'm concerned about the fact that the Republican leadership of our country continues to support
[02:25:28.287 --> 02:25:29.248]  We're good to go.
[02:25:45.063 --> 02:25:45.683]  We're good to go.
[02:26:14.178 --> 02:26:19.299]  So, I sincerely, strongly believe that that is the case.
[02:26:19.559 --> 02:26:20.980]  I don't believe he ever changed.
[02:26:24.901 --> 02:26:36.124]  Bob Chapman, I guess a Hollywood actor, Bohemian Grove, I mean, I guess it's really par for the course, but what year was this whenever you were shown this film?
[02:26:43.464 --> 02:27:09.627]  Late 1970s, early 1980s, but you know when he evolved politically from, we'll call it flirting with the left, George Murphy, who became a senator from California and was a vaudevillian, a song and dance man, an excellent actor, he sort of took Ronald Reagan under his wing
[02:27:10.410 --> 02:27:14.452]  And said, look, this is the way you should think, and so on and so forth.
[02:27:14.652 --> 02:27:20.015]  And he became, he being Ronald Reagan, became the head of the Screen Actors Guild.
[02:27:20.755 --> 02:27:31.941]  And then in 1952-53, he was given a very large contract to do the GE Theater, I think it was called at that time.
[02:27:31.981 --> 02:27:32.762]  Yeah, with the monkey.
[02:27:35.243 --> 02:27:38.024]  So understanding this, Bob Chapman,
[02:27:39.861 --> 02:27:41.562]  That was a political turn for him.
[02:27:44.464 --> 02:27:50.628]  So, I mean, obviously then he's been blackmailed all along if you were taken to some elite screening.
[02:27:50.648 --> 02:27:52.489]  I mean, was this an elite screening or?
[02:27:52.509 --> 02:27:54.730]  Oh yeah, it was elite.
[02:27:56.371 --> 02:27:59.413]  And, uh, but I, I knew already.
[02:28:01.052 --> 02:28:02.694]  Well, I mean, let me tell you something.
[02:28:02.734 --> 02:28:02.994]  Hold on.
[02:28:03.054 --> 02:28:06.277]  If somebody said, come to a screen, did they tell you what was going to be at it?
[02:28:06.437 --> 02:28:16.487]  Because if somebody told me, hypothetically, come to a screening of Bill Clinton, you know, getting rough with a woman or something, you know, which we know he likes to do, he knocks their teeth out.
[02:28:16.848 --> 02:28:19.991]  I would say, no way, no way, no way.
[02:28:20.311 --> 02:28:22.593]  I mean, I'm all about exposing stuff right out in the open.
[02:28:23.214 --> 02:28:24.355]  And it's not that I'm a coward.
[02:28:24.535 --> 02:28:25.776]  I don't have a death wish.
[02:28:26.317 --> 02:28:28.879]  I want to keep operating and fighting them out in the open.
[02:28:29.139 --> 02:28:30.980]  This is the kind of stuff that is super dangerous.
[02:28:31.020 --> 02:28:32.001]  It's like I told the D.C.
[02:28:32.041 --> 02:28:32.382]  madam.
[02:28:32.982 --> 02:28:38.967]  And I mean, why would the I mean, were you told it was a screening of Ronald Reagan or did they just get you there and show it to you?
[02:28:40.368 --> 02:28:42.150]  They said it was important.
[02:28:42.730 --> 02:28:45.112]  They got me there and I was shown it.
[02:28:46.173 --> 02:28:47.414]  Could it have been a fake?
[02:28:47.634 --> 02:28:49.736]  I really didn't know what the content was going to be.
[02:28:50.236 --> 02:28:51.057]  Could it have been a fake?
[02:28:53.053 --> 02:28:53.774]  I don't think so.
[02:28:54.414 --> 02:28:55.294]  Was it black and white?
[02:28:55.314 --> 02:28:58.376]  I don't know about faking movies, but it didn't look fake to me.
[02:28:58.456 --> 02:28:59.316]  Was it black and white?
[02:29:01.858 --> 02:29:02.098]  Yes.
[02:29:02.418 --> 02:29:03.118]  How old did he look?
[02:29:07.020 --> 02:29:08.421]  I quite frankly can't remember.
[02:29:08.861 --> 02:29:11.422]  Was it the older Reagan at the time or was it a younger Reagan?
[02:29:13.243 --> 02:29:14.284]  That's a good question.
[02:29:17.746 --> 02:29:18.686]  I would say older.
[02:29:21.846 --> 02:29:25.401]  Anything else, Bob, that you need to get out now so they don't set a hit team down there?
[02:29:27.802 --> 02:29:31.864]  Well, um, quite frankly, uh, he was a nice person to be around.
[02:29:32.384 --> 02:29:33.244]  He was very... Hold on, hold on.
[02:29:33.264 --> 02:29:37.246]  We're gonna say bye to Charlotte on the other side and let her get ready to pack and go on her trip.
[02:29:37.986 --> 02:29:40.067]  And, uh, Bob's already gone on his trip.
[02:29:40.087 --> 02:29:41.267]  Maybe I should go on my trip.
[02:29:43.508 --> 02:29:44.108]  Oh, man.
[02:29:44.748 --> 02:29:46.569]  I'm gonna be freaked out all weekend over this.
[02:29:47.069 --> 02:29:47.890]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:47.910 --> 02:29:48.390]  Stay with us.
[02:29:48.570 --> 02:29:49.110]  Oh, man.
[02:29:49.650 --> 02:29:50.551]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.051 --> 02:29:52.651]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.572 --> 02:29:56.273]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.233 --> 02:30:00.393]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:30:00.413 --> 02:30:07.076]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:30:07.336 --> 02:30:09.616]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:30:09.897 --> 02:30:15.078]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:30:15.278 --> 02:30:18.039]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:30:18.319 --> 02:30:20.380]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:30:20.620 --> 02:30:26.562]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:30:26.882 --> 02:30:30.063]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:30:30.243 --> 02:30:35.785]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:30:36.025 --> 02:30:37.346]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:30:37.666 --> 02:30:38.826]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:30:38.966 --> 02:30:41.527]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:30:41.647 --> 02:30:43.048]  He explains everything you need to know.
[02:30:43.348 --> 02:30:45.289]  Folks, you've heard us talk about Home Gain before.

[02:31:58.322 --> 02:32:02.565]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:32:02.865 --> 02:32:03.146]  Number 1.
[02:32:03.786 --> 02:32:06.948]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:32:07.209 --> 02:32:07.769]  Number 2.
[02:32:08.069 --> 02:32:12.613]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:32:12.973 --> 02:32:13.413]  It's true.
[02:32:13.713 --> 02:32:18.257]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:32:18.577 --> 02:32:19.117]  Number 3.
[02:32:19.398 --> 02:32:22.680]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:32:22.980 --> 02:32:26.663]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:32:26.883 --> 02:32:27.143]  Number 4.
[02:32:27.684 --> 02:32:30.046]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:32:30.446 --> 02:32:33.830]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:32:34.130 --> 02:32:34.350]  Number 5.
[02:32:34.911 --> 02:32:38.834]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:32:39.074 --> 02:32:43.819]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:32:44.099 --> 02:32:48.142]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:48.282 --> 02:32:49.844]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:50.064 --> 02:32:52.145]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:32:52.326 --> 02:32:54.667]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:32:59.454 --> 02:33:13.602]  We are in process of developing a whole series of techniques which will enable the controlling oligarchy to get people actually to love their servitude.
[02:33:14.202 --> 02:33:23.208]  People can be made to enjoy a state of affairs which, by any decent standard, they ought not to enjoy.
[02:33:23.228 --> 02:33:25.569]  Perhaps you had better start from the beginning.
[02:33:29.372 --> 02:33:31.134]  I hope she would better start from the beginning.
[02:33:31.154 --> 02:33:36.701]  I hope she would better start from the beginning.
[02:33:40.046 --> 02:33:42.949]  Too many kids are what's making the planet worse.
[02:33:43.230 --> 02:33:45.472]  A lot of these kids come from bad gene pools.
[02:33:45.552 --> 02:33:48.036]  They don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[02:33:50.174 --> 02:33:56.135]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatric.
[02:33:56.515 --> 02:34:03.336]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[02:34:03.416 --> 02:34:08.417]  Fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay, but could it also cause cancer?
[02:34:08.437 --> 02:34:11.278]  Turns out the government had the right, under U.S.
[02:34:11.338 --> 02:34:15.538]  law, to conduct secret testing on the American public under specific conditions.
[02:34:15.638 --> 02:34:18.599]  We have to work the dark side, or we're going to spend time in the shadows.
[02:34:19.927 --> 02:34:23.810]  Any attempt to achieve world order must be the work of the devil.
[02:34:23.950 --> 02:34:24.730]  Well, join me.
[02:34:25.271 --> 02:34:27.632]  I'm glad to sit here at the right hand of Satan.
[02:34:27.652 --> 02:34:29.453]  There's a need for a new world order.
[02:34:31.015 --> 02:34:31.515]  Someday.
[02:34:32.656 --> 02:34:34.217]  In the next few years.
[02:34:35.778 --> 02:34:45.344]  A solution will emerge.
[02:34:45.384 --> 02:34:47.826]  It is Friday, the seventh day of the new year. 2011.
[02:34:50.149 --> 02:34:52.011]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:34:52.071 --> 02:34:55.694]  Bob Chapman of InternationalForecaster.com is our guest.
[02:34:56.134 --> 02:35:02.439]  The former head of policy, number two position in the Ronald Reagan first administration Department of Education.
[02:35:02.939 --> 02:35:05.261]  Charlotte Isserby is our guest.
[02:35:05.301 --> 02:35:07.723]  Her father and grandfather were skull and bones.
[02:35:09.289 --> 02:35:20.315]  And we have got, it's got to be 10 hours of bombshell interviews with her, and almost all of it's going up on PrisonPlanet.tv, a bunch of other big interviews going up in the next few weeks there.
[02:35:21.196 --> 02:35:23.117]  We're pulling out all the stops in the info war.
[02:35:23.157 --> 02:35:24.257]  Charlotte, we're going to let you go.
[02:35:24.277 --> 02:35:25.618]  I want you to have a great trip.
[02:35:25.638 --> 02:35:27.179]  But you were getting into Reagan during the break.
[02:35:27.659 --> 02:35:33.743]  Of course, you knew him, just like Bob, on record, worked in the campaign and things, or knew him quite well.
[02:35:33.783 --> 02:35:39.567]  But going back here, you were talking about Here's the Rest of Him, a book, another woman you knew.
[02:35:58.559 --> 02:36:00.259]  He was pro-gun control.
[02:36:00.279 --> 02:36:04.500]  Yeah, and pro-regional government, and everything.
[02:36:04.540 --> 02:36:14.942]  And see, the Republicans, the United Republicans of California, that's Southern California, prior to him being elected president, they got that ten years ahead, really.
[02:36:15.002 --> 02:36:20.123]  They knew what he'd done as governor in California, so they wrote this little book.
[02:36:20.223 --> 02:36:25.604]  And I was given that book, and I got mad at them, because they were beating up on my hero.
[02:36:26.324 --> 02:36:27.505]  And I didn't read the book.
[02:36:27.565 --> 02:36:30.746]  And then I went into the department and I found out exactly what he is.
[02:36:31.486 --> 02:36:33.287]  And then I got out of the department.
[02:36:33.327 --> 02:36:34.688]  He didn't respond to my letter.
[02:36:34.708 --> 02:36:36.149]  I got fired, you know.
[02:36:36.529 --> 02:36:38.410]  And then I went back and I read the book.
[02:36:38.870 --> 02:36:41.811]  And I thought, Charlotte, you naive little baby.
[02:36:42.251 --> 02:36:45.193]  You should have believed the United Republicans of California.
[02:36:45.213 --> 02:36:47.053]  This guy is a fraud.
[02:36:48.894 --> 02:36:51.475]  That's the nicest thing I can say about Ronald Reagan.
[02:36:51.816 --> 02:36:54.697]  I think he was a very, very good actor.
[02:36:56.431 --> 02:36:58.333]  Charlotte Isby, have a great vacation.
[02:36:58.393 --> 02:37:00.395]  We look forward to having you back when you return.
[02:37:00.715 --> 02:37:06.181]  Thank you so much for spending time with Rob Due and Aaron Dykes up there in the last two video interviews.
[02:37:06.441 --> 02:37:08.283]  Yeah, well I enjoyed them enormously.
[02:37:08.323 --> 02:37:13.588]  They're great young people and I wish we had more young people like that who cared about this country.
[02:37:14.589 --> 02:37:15.490]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[02:37:15.690 --> 02:37:17.051]  Charlotte, God bless you and take care.
[02:37:17.071 --> 02:37:17.371]  Bye.
[02:37:17.391 --> 02:37:18.252]  Alright, there she goes.
[02:37:18.553 --> 02:37:20.194]  Well, I got her on about the CMP.
[02:37:21.237 --> 02:37:24.680]  Because I get these emails, you had Pat Buchanan on, you're best friends with him.
[02:37:24.700 --> 02:37:27.802]  I've had him on like, I think three times, four times over the years.
[02:37:28.262 --> 02:37:31.925]  And I am, I do like him, you know, he's anti-war, pro-gun, but I don't trust him.
[02:37:31.945 --> 02:37:32.706]  He worked for Nixon.
[02:37:34.167 --> 02:37:37.570]  Or other people I have on, they're like, that guy's new world order, he's in the CMP.
[02:37:37.890 --> 02:37:39.871]  A lot of this is just conservatives that have been invited.
[02:37:40.692 --> 02:37:41.753]  Just like the CFR.
[02:37:42.033 --> 02:37:43.335]  You can't say every person.
[02:37:43.375 --> 02:37:44.736]  I've had professors send me emails.
[02:37:45.056 --> 02:37:46.978]  I'm a professor at biology and I'm a member.
[02:37:47.239 --> 02:37:48.720]  How dare you say we're New World Order?
[02:37:49.060 --> 02:37:50.722]  Well, and I sent an email back years ago.
[02:37:50.742 --> 02:37:55.386]  Well, I'm not saying you are, but I know the CFR reports they put out call for world government.
[02:37:56.107 --> 02:37:58.830]  I know it was set up by British intelligence at Pratt House in New York in 1922.
[02:38:00.973 --> 02:38:05.718]  It's the overall organizations and it's hard to shake me up.
[02:38:06.158 --> 02:38:09.782]  And Bob, what shook me up is not that there's wild stuff going on in Hollywood.
[02:38:10.502 --> 02:38:20.132]  It's that Ronald Reagan is such an icon for so many conservatives as like this image of conservatism and what he said, the things he was for on paper sounded really great.
[02:38:21.653 --> 02:38:30.127]  I remember watching politics during the Republican and Democratic conventions in 79, 80, and my parents not telling me what political views to have.
[02:38:30.187 --> 02:38:30.868]  Who do you like?
[02:38:31.289 --> 02:38:34.334]  So I watched the Democrat, Republican, and I said, I like the Republicans.
[02:38:34.394 --> 02:38:35.255]  I like Ronald Reagan.
[02:38:36.141 --> 02:38:41.667]  When I was, you know, six years old or whatever, I'm only 36 folks, and it's just that icon image.
[02:38:42.528 --> 02:38:46.133]  But it's not even that he was some woman doing something freaky.
[02:38:46.153 --> 02:38:49.457]  I mean, that's still disconcerting, but I'm not here judging people.
[02:38:49.937 --> 02:38:54.582]  It's Bob Chapman, who I know is an icon conservative who's got the
[02:38:55.123 --> 02:38:57.725]  True conservative pedigree going back to 50 years.
[02:38:58.125 --> 02:38:59.366]  I know you know all these people.
[02:38:59.426 --> 02:39:00.847]  I know you've been instrumental in all this stuff.
[02:39:00.907 --> 02:39:02.568]  I know you were friends with Reagan.
[02:39:02.608 --> 02:39:03.288]  That's on record.
[02:39:03.649 --> 02:39:07.471]  And then you come on air and say that, and so I have to take it as the truth.
[02:39:08.272 --> 02:39:09.493]  I wish it wasn't the truth.
[02:39:09.553 --> 02:39:11.654]  It's like I don't know how to compute that.
[02:39:11.694 --> 02:39:14.096]  I mean, that sounds so Hollywood-esque.
[02:39:14.656 --> 02:39:20.478]  You know, dark film right there, just black and white footage of Ronald Reagan.
[02:39:23.159 --> 02:39:25.400]  Why were you invited to this meeting, Bob Chapman?
[02:39:26.621 --> 02:39:29.682]  Because I was connected to a couple of other people who were invited.
[02:39:32.003 --> 02:39:32.963]  And what did they say?
[02:39:33.003 --> 02:39:34.404]  They said, this is why we're showing this?
[02:39:35.684 --> 02:39:41.007]  No, they just said it's a very interesting film and you should come and watch it.
[02:39:42.873 --> 02:39:45.554]  I know these people quite well, so I said, well, okay, I'll go.
[02:39:46.875 --> 02:39:47.956]  And that's what I found out.
[02:39:48.856 --> 02:39:51.358]  And they said to me afterwards, well, what do you think?
[02:39:51.458 --> 02:39:53.699]  I said, well, I'm surprised that I'm not.
[02:39:54.579 --> 02:39:58.121]  And then I told them what I had learned from somebody else years before.
[02:39:59.302 --> 02:40:08.106]  And, um... Do you think this was an intelligence-gathering operation with people they know, knew, and were friends with Ronald Reagan to see if they could get more intel?
[02:40:09.367 --> 02:40:11.168]  No, these were people, uh...
[02:40:12.035 --> 02:40:17.396]  The ones who I knew who were there, who I knew who they were, they were all very conservative people.
[02:40:19.117 --> 02:40:22.618]  But there were other people there I didn't know, so... How many people were there, roughly?
[02:40:24.418 --> 02:40:24.638]  About 15, 18.
[02:40:25.579 --> 02:40:31.800]  I know as soon as this show's over, I'm gonna think of a hundred things I wanted to ask you about this.
[02:40:32.520 --> 02:40:35.481]  Well, I'm gonna be around for a long time, so don't worry about it.
[02:40:36.661 --> 02:40:37.242]  No, I know.
[02:40:37.302 --> 02:40:38.582]  But you know, I was shocked, too.
[02:40:39.415 --> 02:40:41.616]  And, uh, and I liked him.
[02:40:41.636 --> 02:40:44.297]  Uh, he was a very nice person.
[02:40:44.317 --> 02:40:47.298]  Uh, you know, at least, uh, to meet socially.
[02:40:47.318 --> 02:40:53.200]  Uh, and, um... That's just the way it turned out.
[02:40:53.300 --> 02:40:56.241]  And, you know, I lived in Southern California for 36 years.
[02:40:57.141 --> 02:41:06.785]  And, uh, you came to expect that you would find out things like that about people that you wouldn't normally find, uh,
[02:41:07.575 --> 02:41:09.556]  Out in Indianapolis, Indiana.
[02:41:10.337 --> 02:41:15.119]  It was a pretty wild lifestyle in California, just like there is in New York City.
[02:41:16.180 --> 02:41:18.021]  And especially Southern California.
[02:41:18.061 --> 02:41:20.222]  Well, I guess San Francisco has been.
[02:41:20.342 --> 02:41:22.343]  No, I've brushed up against it.
[02:41:22.383 --> 02:41:23.003]  I don't like it.
[02:41:23.424 --> 02:41:25.325]  And we've got a lot of affiliates out in California.
[02:41:25.345 --> 02:41:27.166]  Beautiful coast, nice people.
[02:41:27.686 --> 02:41:30.928]  I just don't like Los Angeles and the overall
[02:41:31.468 --> 02:41:34.009]  Well, I don't know why it was taped, but I think it was for blackmail.
[02:42:01.272 --> 02:42:04.133]  And then it was, I think, used politically later.
[02:42:04.293 --> 02:42:05.033]  Well, no kidding.
[02:42:05.113 --> 02:42:10.535]  Well, then why would they leak it out to these people so the message would get back to Rainbow Ronnie that everybody knew?
[02:42:12.216 --> 02:42:13.456]  No, I don't think so.
[02:42:13.976 --> 02:42:20.378]  I just think that they felt it was time to show it, I guess.
[02:42:21.138 --> 02:42:22.259]  I really don't know there.
[02:42:22.915 --> 02:42:35.042]  Well, I can't play it on air because there's so much profanity, but Harper's Magazine six years ago published another report about Nixon interviews they'd done and stuff they didn't publish in the seventies.
[02:42:35.762 --> 02:42:38.704]  And when people thought, said, oh, that can't be true, they released the tape.
[02:42:39.424 --> 02:42:44.129]  And it's, uh, you know, Bohemian Grove, San Francisco and Northern California.
[02:42:44.149 --> 02:42:46.872]  Yeah, they all go up there with Reagan and everybody else.
[02:42:46.892 --> 02:42:51.938]  Let me tell you something, it's the most, you know, and they started using profanity, but talking about all the homosexual activity.
[02:42:52.659 --> 02:42:53.159]  And, uh...
[02:42:54.491 --> 02:43:00.214]  It just seems to always pop up with Republicans, and then with Democrats, it's like beating women and stuff.
[02:43:00.254 --> 02:43:14.522]  It's like Democrats, it's always breaking women's noses, and then Republicans, unless it's Dick Cheney, he likes what the Democrats like, it's the walking dead with his bionic heart with no pulse, Dick Cheney.
[02:43:14.602 --> 02:43:18.464]  And with Republicans, how many of them get caught in restrooms and stuff?
[02:43:18.484 --> 02:43:19.425]  I mean, what's going on?
[02:43:19.665 --> 02:43:23.067]  I mean, do you have to be like that to be a super high-level Republican?
[02:43:24.488 --> 02:43:35.473]  No, I don't think so, but I do believe, after having lived for many years in Southern California, that it certainly helps one's career if they engage in those kind of things.
[02:43:39.115 --> 02:43:39.535]  Oh boy.
[02:43:40.775 --> 02:43:43.497]  Well, you... It was very, very prevalent.
[02:43:43.557 --> 02:43:45.838]  You know, I lived there in the 60s, 70s, 80s.
[02:43:46.658 --> 02:43:47.618]  A long, long time.
[02:43:48.439 --> 02:43:49.159]  Into the 90s.
[02:43:50.300 --> 02:43:51.780]  And so I saw lots.
[02:43:51.860 --> 02:43:53.281]  I lived in Malibu for years.
[02:43:54.580 --> 02:44:02.627]  I spent a lot of time in Beverly Hills and all over Los Angeles, but I saw lots, met lots of people.
[02:44:06.091 --> 02:44:07.212]  Nothing surprises me.
[02:44:10.635 --> 02:44:14.298]  So you think Nancy knows about this reported stuff you're talking about?
[02:44:15.159 --> 02:44:16.020]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:44:17.321 --> 02:44:20.604]  I don't see how she could not have known.
[02:44:22.076 --> 02:44:30.619]  The reason I ask what color the film footage is, it's much easier, back in the 70s they'd still be using animation, it's much easier to fake a black and white.
[02:44:33.900 --> 02:44:35.661]  But it goes beyond the film.
[02:44:39.182 --> 02:44:40.943]  You know, there was other evidence I had.
[02:44:42.304 --> 02:44:45.527]  But, you know, it's not something I've talked about in all the years.
[02:44:45.547 --> 02:44:47.929]  Well, let's get it... Bob, you're a smart cookie.
[02:44:47.949 --> 02:44:49.991]  You know, once you've talked about this, you've got to tell it all.
[02:44:50.452 --> 02:44:52.774]  So, despite... I wish I never would have asked the question.
[02:44:52.814 --> 02:44:55.016]  Now we have to get all the pus out of the wound here.
[02:44:55.336 --> 02:44:55.777]  What else?
[02:44:55.837 --> 02:44:56.678]  What's the other evidence?
[02:44:56.698 --> 02:44:57.538]  Let's get it all out.
[02:44:58.860 --> 02:45:00.301]  No, I don't have any other evidence.
[02:45:00.341 --> 02:45:00.882]  Okay, good.
[02:45:00.962 --> 02:45:02.783]  Make sure every bit is squeezed out, okay?
[02:45:03.044 --> 02:45:03.584]  You know why.
[02:45:03.604 --> 02:45:04.685]  You know, that's it.
[02:45:04.966 --> 02:45:07.348]  And it was my personal experience.
[02:45:08.471 --> 02:45:12.052]  And it happened, and that's the end of it.
[02:45:13.893 --> 02:45:17.094]  And the poor soul is dead now, and that's where we all go.
[02:45:18.935 --> 02:45:21.416]  I thought you were going to say he was a communist or something.
[02:45:22.356 --> 02:45:22.896]  I didn't know.
[02:45:22.916 --> 02:45:24.997]  No, but he was on the edge there.
[02:45:25.037 --> 02:45:27.598]  In fact, I knew people quite well.
[02:45:28.918 --> 02:45:34.160]  In fact, I remember one businessman lived right on Wilshire Boulevard, just before the Miracle Mile.
[02:45:35.306 --> 02:46:02.249]  and uh... and uh... he was a client of mine i was a stockbroker and he said you know i came from texas and you know this ronald reagan used to make lots of speeches throughout the west he made a number of them in texas and i heard he said boy if this guy isn't a communist he's close to it so i knew people who had actually seen his speeches who thought he was very leftist we'll put it that way
[02:46:04.093 --> 02:46:11.776]  And as I was trying to tell you, he met up, he knew George Murphy, of course, and Murphy had been head of the Screen Actors Guild.
[02:46:12.116 --> 02:46:19.979]  He got Ronald Reagan elected, appointed him to the right, so to speak, and then he got the GE contract, and his whole life changed.
[02:46:19.999 --> 02:46:21.059]  He was all washed up.
[02:46:25.421 --> 02:46:25.661]  Wow.
[02:46:26.641 --> 02:46:28.902]  And George Murphy resuscitated him.
[02:46:32.128 --> 02:46:37.911]  Well, I don't know what else to say here today, Bob, but I will imagine... Well, let's talk about business and finance!
[02:46:38.972 --> 02:46:44.455]  Yeah, they tried to push gold and silver down this week, but give us your take on that.
[02:46:45.656 --> 02:47:00.124]  Well, I think the appointment of Mr. Daley, one of the Daley crime family persons from Chicago, and he's appointed the Chief of Staff, it just so happens that he is the
[02:47:00.754 --> 02:47:06.717]  Managing Director of the Midwest office of a firm called JPMorgan Chase.
[02:47:08.517 --> 02:47:11.659]  And they wanted everything to be hunky-dory with him getting appointed.
[02:47:11.859 --> 02:47:16.481]  And we have the Obama clip to interrupt where he says, I don't want to appoint a bunch of Wall Street fat cats.
[02:47:16.781 --> 02:47:19.082]  I've never seen an administration as packed full of them.
[02:47:20.282 --> 02:47:22.123]  Well, it's every administration.
[02:47:24.004 --> 02:47:28.506]  For years and years, as a follow-up on Dylann Reed, which is no longer in business,
[02:47:29.704 --> 02:47:30.865]  Yeah, they're the real big dog.
[02:47:59.062 --> 02:47:59.603]  That's right.
[02:48:02.065 --> 02:48:05.108]  And this man daily is working for them.
[02:48:05.688 --> 02:48:10.653]  I think they wanted the commodities and the gold and silver to go down, to make things look good.
[02:48:11.173 --> 02:48:17.099]  And then they had an employment report that came out, and it was preceded by ADP's report.
[02:48:17.779 --> 02:48:19.721]  It was so screwed, it was unbelievable.
[02:48:20.162 --> 02:48:24.626]  I mean, how they could, as professionals, put that report out, I just can't imagine.
[02:48:25.530 --> 02:48:34.496]  What does it mean in China to now have the IMF, World Bank and others now buying Chinese currency?
[02:48:34.516 --> 02:48:37.538]  I mean, that's a big move, isn't it?
[02:48:37.578 --> 02:48:39.620]  And they're really moving away from the dollar in high speed now.
[02:48:40.860 --> 02:48:41.221]  They are.
[02:48:41.741 --> 02:48:49.966]  And just before that, just a few weeks ago, the announcement by China and Russia that they were going to do business together in their own currencies.
[02:48:50.867 --> 02:48:51.848]  But that's a natural.
[02:48:52.308 --> 02:48:55.170]  I mean, it was to be expected something like that might happen.
[02:48:56.944 --> 02:49:05.447]  With the bonds, it's relevant, but it's not as relevant as the Chinese and the Russians doing business in their own currencies.
[02:49:06.007 --> 02:49:06.727]  That's big time.
[02:49:07.707 --> 02:49:09.548]  And we're leading up here.
[02:49:09.928 --> 02:49:17.530]  You know, we discussed this early last year on the program, and I said, I think something could happen by the end of the year, which was just passed.
[02:49:18.030 --> 02:49:19.191]  It didn't happen.
[02:49:19.951 --> 02:49:21.171]  Everything wasn't in place.
[02:49:21.791 --> 02:49:24.192]  But this time, we get two events happening.
[02:49:24.861 --> 02:49:26.082]  that are very, very important.
[02:49:26.822 --> 02:49:42.932]  One is the situation in Europe, the tremendous amount of money that has to be raised, especially during the first six months of the year, by the European nations, and particularly by those who are deeply in debt.
[02:49:43.913 --> 02:49:53.079]  And with that, you can add in the situation with American municipalities.
[02:49:53.888 --> 02:49:56.590]  This is something that I predicted three years ago.
[02:49:56.630 --> 02:49:58.572]  I told everybody to get out of municipals.
[02:49:59.032 --> 02:50:00.213]  This is what's going to happen.
[02:50:00.293 --> 02:50:00.834]  It happened.
[02:50:01.975 --> 02:50:11.362]  And you're going to these two events are going to come together in the second half of the year, probably the last quarter of this year.
[02:50:12.763 --> 02:50:20.089]  And it's going to be rock'em, sock'em, because I think that the euro will be under tremendous pressure.
[02:50:20.629 --> 02:50:22.371]  The whole eurozone structure.
[02:50:23.641 --> 02:50:30.967]  And then, the Republicans have said, look, we're not going to lend or feed more money to the municipalities.
[02:50:31.947 --> 02:50:33.568]  They've got to sort their own problems out.
[02:50:33.929 --> 02:50:37.872]  Well, you were the first guy I heard, like three years ago, predicted the EU would crack up.
[02:50:37.932 --> 02:50:41.214]  Now that's all over their news, that the EU is going to crack up.
[02:50:41.234 --> 02:50:42.415]  Do you still think it's going to crack up?
[02:50:43.256 --> 02:50:44.116]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:50:44.136 --> 02:50:47.459]  It's just a question of how long will it take, and I don't know that.
[02:50:48.248 --> 02:50:54.850]  Okay, we'll come back, get back on the finance, something I'm a little more comfortable with, and talking about Rainbow Ronnie here.
[02:50:54.910 --> 02:50:56.111]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[02:51:00.472 --> 02:51:03.033]  New year, new way to smoke, and it's Totally Wicked!
[02:51:03.333 --> 02:51:08.355]  Introducing Totally Wicked e-liquid electronic cigarettes, the highest quality e-cigarettes in the world.

[02:51:17.458 --> 02:51:21.141]  Totally Wicked e-liquid cigarettes have a battery charge that lasts up to 8 hours.

[02:51:59.110 --> 02:52:01.433]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:52:01.493 --> 02:52:03.696]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:52:03.816 --> 02:52:06.600]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:52:07.020 --> 02:52:11.787]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:52:12.127 --> 02:52:16.333]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:16.633 --> 02:52:18.957]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:18.977 --> 02:52:21.521]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:52:21.861 --> 02:52:24.445]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:24.785 --> 02:52:32.397]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:32.717 --> 02:52:38.002]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:38.102 --> 02:52:40.385]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:40.425 --> 02:52:44.388]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:52:44.649 --> 02:52:45.570]  And I got news for you.
[02:52:45.730 --> 02:52:47.031]  You're everyone else.
[02:52:47.051 --> 02:52:48.052]  Invisible Empire.

[02:52:58.382 --> 02:53:01.664]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[02:53:02.464 --> 02:53:06.706]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[02:53:06.966 --> 02:53:12.909]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[02:53:13.129 --> 02:53:15.270]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[02:53:15.570 --> 02:53:21.513]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[02:53:21.653 --> 02:53:24.997]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[02:53:25.057 --> 02:53:26.759]  There is no other program of its kind.
[02:53:26.939 --> 02:53:28.981]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[02:53:29.122 --> 02:53:33.787]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.
[02:53:34.007 --> 02:53:34.628]  Guaranteed.

[02:53:39.093 --> 02:53:47.116]  Call Zero Debt in 90 days now, 800-477-9256, and ask for free information from an expert who also completed our program.
[02:53:47.136 --> 02:53:47.836]  800-477-9256 or zerodetguarantee.com.
[02:53:47.856 --> 02:53:49.116]  800-477-9256 or zerodetguarantee.com.
[02:54:13.141 --> 02:54:25.831]  Ira Hayes, Ira Hayes, call him Drunken Ira Hayes, his evil answer anymore.
[02:54:26.612 --> 02:54:31.616]  Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian, nor the Marine that went to war.
[02:54:38.280 --> 02:54:57.026]  I'm a little bit late getting back in the studio because my sister was on the PrisonPlanet.com forum and said, is this real?
[02:54:57.226 --> 02:54:59.947]  And I do have the actual copy of it somewhere in my archives here.
[02:55:00.407 --> 02:55:01.208]  It's the headline
[02:55:03.592 --> 02:55:10.640]  Credit card receipts and snare call boy ring inside Reagan Bush White House, Washington Times.
[02:55:10.740 --> 02:55:18.108]  And then it came out in some other newspapers and they're trying to, because they don't have an IM to that computer for on air, they're trying to grab it right now to put it up.
[02:55:18.148 --> 02:55:23.494]  So that would add some mainstream news to what Bob Chapman was saying.
[02:55:23.614 --> 02:55:24.054]  There it is.
[02:55:26.141 --> 02:55:29.023]  Yeah, there's the actual microfilm scan of it.
[02:55:29.504 --> 02:55:31.365]  Show folks that again so I can read the whole headline, please.
[02:55:31.645 --> 02:55:32.826]  Scroll back to the left side.
[02:55:34.488 --> 02:55:43.354]  Homosexual prostitution inquiry ensnares VIPs with Reagan Bush.
[02:55:44.397 --> 02:55:46.758]  Cole Boyce took midnight tour of White House.
[02:55:46.958 --> 02:55:53.099]  And you know, even though the stuff sounds shocking, remember the gay porn stars going to Bohemian Grove in the news?
[02:55:53.159 --> 02:56:02.301]  Remember the gay madam who was the hundreds of midnight visits into the Bush, George W. Bush White House?
[02:56:02.742 --> 02:56:03.322]  Bob Chapman?
[02:56:03.362 --> 02:56:03.882]  I mean, really?
[02:56:05.208 --> 02:56:08.031]  It's shocking to hear that, but then when you look at all the other evidence, it's not.
[02:56:08.131 --> 02:56:08.511]  So there.
[02:56:08.791 --> 02:56:12.474]  When the media goes crazy with this, I just showed you a mainstream news article.
[02:56:12.515 --> 02:56:14.716]  I could show you more pointing the same direction.
[02:56:14.777 --> 02:56:21.983]  So I'm glad that Marley ran into that, because I was telling her, you know, search Ronald Reagan gay, and that came up.
[02:56:22.263 --> 02:56:23.364]  So there you go, Bob Chapman.
[02:56:23.384 --> 02:56:25.186]  There's some Washington Times backup for you.
[02:56:27.691 --> 02:56:33.376]  Well, I don't know whether I should have said anything, but it's out, and that's just the way it is.
[02:56:36.979 --> 02:56:37.539]  Oh, man.
[02:56:37.799 --> 02:56:39.821]  And as I say, he was a nice guy.
[02:56:40.822 --> 02:56:47.267]  But everybody has their, well, many people have proclivities that are different than others.
[02:56:50.251 --> 02:56:54.052]  It was quite an experience living for 36 years in Southern California.
[02:56:54.292 --> 02:56:54.512]  Yeah.
[02:56:55.553 --> 02:56:56.893]  Other things on the radar.
[02:56:56.933 --> 02:56:59.834]  The environmentalists are going crazy all of a sudden.
[02:56:59.854 --> 02:57:12.357]  We got two new articles on this today with one of these top IPCC UN officials calling for an elite warrior leadership and prison cities and everyone basically suppressed and authoritarian control.
[02:57:12.877 --> 02:57:15.658]  And Watson's got a big list of these globalists saying this.
[02:57:16.138 --> 02:57:17.719]  I mean, they're really going out in the open.
[02:57:18.570 --> 02:57:20.331]  Is this because we're starting to get them on the run?
[02:57:20.351 --> 02:57:28.053]  I mean, they came out today, the federal government admitted fluorides hurting kids, or are they just throwing it all in our face, or is it a mixture?
[02:57:30.534 --> 02:57:31.755]  No, I think we've got them on the run.
[02:57:31.815 --> 02:57:35.096]  The last thing they want to do is have things exposed.
[02:57:36.413 --> 02:57:41.357]  The transition to what they want, which is world government, they would like it to be as smooth as possible.
[02:57:42.237 --> 02:57:55.386]  They don't want riots and revolution and demonstrations and they don't want people to know that they're in your face, which they are now because they've been pushed there, in regard to world government.
[02:57:56.447 --> 02:58:03.352]  They would rather it be under the radar, subliminal, if you may,
[02:58:04.125 --> 02:58:09.007]  And I think they'd rather have it that way and you gotta go back for years.
[02:58:09.027 --> 02:58:16.789]  I started to get the Council on Foreign Relations House Organ Foreign Affairs in 1960.
[02:58:18.069 --> 02:58:19.590]  And yes, they talked about
[02:58:20.236 --> 02:58:23.138]  The things that they wanted to do, but not like they do today.
[02:58:23.198 --> 02:58:23.998]  Yeah.
[02:58:24.018 --> 02:58:29.801]  Bob, TheInternationalForecaster.com or 800-686-2237 if folks want to call and get a free introductory copy.
[02:58:30.341 --> 02:58:31.502]  Bob, have a great weekend.
[02:58:31.562 --> 02:58:33.043]  God willing, we'll see you next Friday.
[02:58:33.283 --> 02:58:34.343]  Have a great weekend, my friend.
[02:58:34.383 --> 02:58:36.324]  I'll see everybody back live, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:58:36.344 --> 02:58:36.925]  Central here.
[02:58:37.005 --> 02:58:37.545]  God willing.
[02:58:37.565 --> 02:58:38.365]  God bless you all.
[02:58:39.266 --> 02:58:44.228]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[02:58:45.249 --> 02:58:48.130]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[02:58:48.731 --> 02:58:49.351]  A very well-
[02:58:50.692 --> 02:58:54.315]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:58:54.715 --> 02:58:57.738]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:58:57.958 --> 02:59:02.742]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:59:02.762 --> 02:59:08.987]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:59:09.147 --> 02:59:11.389]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:59:11.929 --> 02:59:12.209]  Tim Geithner?
[02:59:12.229 --> 02:59:12.649]  Bernanke?
[02:59:12.749 --> 02:59:13.370]  They're arsonists!
[02:59:13.410 --> 02:59:14.670]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:59:14.690 --> 02:59:16.932]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:59:30.839 --> 02:59:32.681]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:59:32.961 --> 02:59:37.725]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
