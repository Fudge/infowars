[00:00:04.634 --> 00:00:05.274]  Big Brother.
[00:00:05.935 --> 00:00:06.976]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.717 --> 00:00:08.858]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.478 --> 00:00:10.279]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:12.521]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:16.205]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.805 --> 00:00:20.869]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.784 --> 00:00:36.384]  This happens sometimes.
[00:00:37.865 --> 00:01:01.730]  A piece of information comes out that is so important, so powerful, that I am unable to even address it on air because I don't feel competent to be able to cover every facet and nuance of it and fully get across to you just how devastatingly evil it is.
[00:01:05.707 --> 00:01:07.988]  I was unable to sleep last night.
[00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:09.209]  Neither was Erin Dykes.
[00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:20.295]  She stayed up all night long to put together what we're going to premiere here on the radio and at PrisonPlanet.tv in 32 minutes from now.
[00:01:22.516 --> 00:01:23.857]  But I have had no sleep.
[00:01:23.957 --> 00:01:24.777]  I'm not complaining.
[00:01:24.837 --> 00:01:25.718]  I'm a little bit dingy.
[00:01:28.008 --> 00:01:35.196]  Sometimes things like this get me so wound up and so upset that I'm unable to sleep.
[00:01:39.721 --> 00:01:48.170]  And all of the news I have in front of me symbolizes ramifications that are so important to the future of our species.
[00:01:51.044 --> 00:01:57.948]  And bottom line, I just don't want the bad things that are happening and that are going to happen to our species to unfold.
[00:01:58.489 --> 00:02:00.710]  I genuinely care about people.
[00:02:01.891 --> 00:02:03.712]  I genuinely care about myself.
[00:02:04.972 --> 00:02:07.454]  I see the best in people, but I also see the worst.
[00:02:08.214 --> 00:02:12.597]  See, one-dimensional thinking would be, oh, he sees the glass as half empty or half full.
[00:02:12.617 --> 00:02:15.299]  No, I see it as half empty and half full.
[00:02:19.361 --> 00:02:20.242]  And of course, all of us
[00:02:21.494 --> 00:02:29.739]  see it as both ways as well, but we're taught to see things at a very limited level.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:47.470]  And that's the great crime in this giant social engineering experiment, is that the globalists have stated that they're attempting to dumb us down, to limit people's horizons, to clutter the educational process where people become just frustrated and stunted.
[00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.411]  It's all a direct
[00:02:50.273 --> 00:02:50.753]  Program.
[00:02:52.014 --> 00:02:52.635]  A blueprint.
[00:02:54.296 --> 00:03:11.327]  And the more I learn about it, the more fundamentally freaked out I get, and the more disgusted with the New World Order I get, and the more determined I am that we beat these people.
[00:03:12.167 --> 00:03:14.509]  And we beat them starting at home with ourselves.
[00:03:15.666 --> 00:03:35.110]  Because we're all human, and we all have faults, but the globalists at the top understand how humans operate, they study human behavior, and they use all that information to make us as weak and pathetic as possible, so that we're not in the game of life, so that we're not on the field, so that we can just be run over.
[00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:43.752]  And in the process, the globalists, even though they try to stay sequestered from the general public, through classism and statism and
[00:03:45.254 --> 00:04:09.447]  snobbery they're hurting themselves as well because what comes around goes around there is such a thing as you reap what you sow I don't believe in some type of spiritual you know magic karma but but certainly the concept of karma itself is absolutely true you reap what you sow what you do goes out into the world and bounces back onto you
[00:04:11.553 --> 00:04:15.694]  I do know, though, in the spiritual fundamentals of you reap what you sow.
[00:04:16.774 --> 00:04:22.155]  That is, well, the seeds you throw out onto the dirt, well, that's the type of plants you get back.
[00:04:22.655 --> 00:04:24.216]  You must judge a tree by its fruits.
[00:04:24.496 --> 00:04:27.116]  And we worked on this video.
[00:04:27.136 --> 00:04:29.637]  Aaron worked on it all night long.
[00:04:31.257 --> 00:04:32.857]  I was up all night doing research.
[00:04:34.658 --> 00:04:35.658]  And now here I am.
[00:04:37.338 --> 00:04:51.828]  It's almost a form of self-medicating to not sleep sometimes and get exhausted because then the pain and anguish that you have isn't as painful because you're dulled by the exhaustion.
[00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.792]  But we've got very special information coming up.
[00:04:58.652 --> 00:04:59.073]  Stay with us.

[00:05:59.312 --> 00:06:03.535]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:06:03.855 --> 00:06:04.136]  Number 1.
[00:06:04.776 --> 00:06:07.918]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:08.759]  Number 2.
[00:06:09.059 --> 00:06:13.603]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:06:13.943 --> 00:06:14.403]  It's true.
[00:06:14.683 --> 00:06:19.247]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:06:19.567 --> 00:06:20.107]  Number 3.
[00:06:20.388 --> 00:06:23.670]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:27.673]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:06:27.873 --> 00:06:28.414]  Number 4.
[00:06:28.674 --> 00:06:31.036]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:06:31.436 --> 00:06:34.820]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.660]  Number 5.
[00:06:35.901 --> 00:06:39.824]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:06:40.044 --> 00:06:44.809]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:06:45.109 --> 00:06:49.113]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:49.273 --> 00:06:50.834]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:51.055 --> 00:06:53.137]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:06:53.317 --> 00:06:55.659]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:07:00.436 --> 00:07:04.080]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.463]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:07:07.703 --> 00:07:12.488]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:07:12.508 --> 00:07:18.713]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:07:18.894 --> 00:07:21.136]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:07:21.476 --> 00:07:21.776]  Tim Geithner?
[00:07:21.796 --> 00:07:21.956]  Bernanke?
[00:07:21.976 --> 00:07:22.416]  They're arsonists!
[00:07:22.476 --> 00:07:23.377]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:07:23.397 --> 00:07:25.017]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:07:40.563 --> 00:07:42.405]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:07:42.425 --> 00:07:47.489]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:07:47.849 --> 00:07:57.778]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:06.065]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:20.799 --> 00:08:21.720]  We are live.
[00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:24.744]  It is the 8th day of February, 2011.
[00:08:26.026 --> 00:08:29.671]  Thank you for joining us on this live Tuesday edition.
[00:08:29.691 --> 00:08:37.041]  In the last hour of the broadcast, the son of Jesse Ventura, a filmmaker and TV producer in his own right,
[00:08:37.862 --> 00:08:45.408]  Tyrell Ventura will be joining us to talk about a lot of behind-the-scenes things that went on on the last two seasons of Conspiracy Theory.
[00:08:45.888 --> 00:09:00.059]  The censorship, his father suing the TSA over the groping, and Jesse Ventura is going to give us the first interview or the first day he does interviews when he returns in early April from Mexico.
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.902]  He will be on this broadcast first.
[00:09:03.382 --> 00:09:15.246]  I'm told he's doing, I believe, Good Morning America first, and then this radio broadcast on that Monday that he has returned to the United States in early April.
[00:09:16.066 --> 00:09:17.106]  So that is coming up.
[00:09:17.707 --> 00:09:21.248]  Tyrell Ventura will be joining us.
[00:09:21.748 --> 00:09:27.810]  Ventura would be on with us, but again, he's an hour away from a telephone, or 45 minutes technically.
[00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:55.575]  uh... and uh... does not even have uh... phone service there he literally lives in a bungalow on the side of the beach trying to get away from the new world order i got a lot of news we're going to cover today it's obviously all very important uh... ron paul on the verge of announcing twenty twelve presidential bid that's a prison planet dot com with ron paul statements there uh... also uh... einstein was right honeybee collapse threatens global food security
[00:09:57.227 --> 00:10:00.709]  We're also going to get into the big developments in Egypt.
[00:10:00.729 --> 00:10:02.209]  There's been some major changes.
[00:10:02.389 --> 00:10:04.450]  Egypt proclaims power transfer plan.
[00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:06.231]  Protesters are wary.
[00:10:07.411 --> 00:10:12.614]  And this report that I meant to get to yesterday is extremely concerning.
[00:10:13.706 --> 00:10:17.908]  New research raises hopes in quest to find universal flu vaccine.
[00:10:18.629 --> 00:10:29.195]  Now these are a new class of so-called vaccines and I've had experts in vaccine development on biologists and medical doctors who were very concerned about this entire new class of vaccines.
[00:10:29.295 --> 00:10:30.896]  I really wouldn't even call them vaccines.
[00:10:31.836 --> 00:10:37.340]  But the media is calling them vaccines, setting the precedent to push whatever they want on you through a needle.
[00:10:38.421 --> 00:10:43.385]  But these are in the similar class to live virus vaccines.
[00:10:44.963 --> 00:10:51.988]  Where they say, oh, this vaccine will cure you, will cure you of drug addiction.
[00:10:52.549 --> 00:10:53.529]  Why they got a vaccine?
[00:10:53.549 --> 00:10:55.671]  They're trying to get approved for alcoholism.
[00:10:56.111 --> 00:10:58.473]  They've got a vaccine to stop you from using cocaine.
[00:10:58.894 --> 00:11:01.636]  They've got a vaccine for nicotine that's in tobacco.
[00:11:02.276 --> 00:11:04.097]  And they admit in these different classes
[00:11:04.938 --> 00:11:06.699]  You know, I've dubbed them brain-eating vaccines.
[00:11:07.319 --> 00:11:28.948]  And in all the mainstream literature, they admit, oh, it goes in and it attacks the receptors of the brain and creates plaques in those receptors to where the body cannot upload the opiates that are in the heroin or the chemicals that are in the cocaine that mimic natural endorphins.
[00:11:30.915 --> 00:11:38.461]  I mean, when we get a link up on the Drudge Report, and I know we're going to get an additional million readers or so to an article, I get an adrenaline rush and we do high fives.
[00:11:39.122 --> 00:11:44.527]  When your football team wins, if you're into that, simulated tribal combat, you get an adrenaline rush.
[00:11:44.547 --> 00:11:49.671]  But more than that, it releases chemicals naturally out of glands in your brain.
[00:11:50.692 --> 00:11:52.072]  that make you feel euphoric.
[00:11:52.652 --> 00:12:06.616]  Well, these different classes of vaccines will actually go in and destroy your capability to have natural brain metabolic changes.
[00:12:09.236 --> 00:12:16.978]  When you hit your second wind, when you're jogging and it's hard the first three miles, or whenever you hit your second wind, boom, all of a sudden you
[00:12:18.464 --> 00:12:21.188]  Feel great and it's a lot easier for the next three or four miles.
[00:12:21.789 --> 00:12:28.297]  And then suddenly you get tired again, but if you push through that, you'll get a third wind if you're really good, in a really good shape.
[00:12:28.858 --> 00:12:31.341]  I'm so out of shape when I jog, I never hit my second wind.
[00:12:31.401 --> 00:12:35.787]  I go about two miles and then, you know, feel like I'm gonna throw up and gotta quit.
[00:12:36.548 --> 00:12:51.347]  uh... but but back when i was in really good shape uh... at about three miles running fast on the hike and bike trail boom i would hit that second wind in the next three miles was just completely easy as you're always going for that uh... but
[00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:54.801]  Side issue getting into those descriptions.
[00:12:55.602 --> 00:13:03.466]  Just to cover an article like this, I could spend three hours in deep detail documenting all of this information and warning you.
[00:13:04.086 --> 00:13:15.772]  This particular catch-all universal flu vaccine attacks the proteins that are in the influenza A virus.
[00:13:18.134 --> 00:13:31.504]  Now, of course, the same proteins that are in that virus are in tens of thousands of other viruses that are naturally occurring in your body and your intestines, predominantly, that are part of your buffer system and part of your health.
[00:13:31.984 --> 00:13:34.106]  And the tens of thousands of different types of bacteria.
[00:13:34.887 --> 00:13:35.947]  And your own cells.
[00:13:37.228 --> 00:13:42.712]  And so imagine the spin-off problems with flesh-eating versions of bacteria
[00:13:43.593 --> 00:13:54.241]  that we have just because we've overused antibiotics and now every year there's more and more forms of bacteria that are completely immune to
[00:13:57.415 --> 00:14:01.817]  Any type of treatment, any type of antibiotic, and so they're killing people.
[00:14:02.397 --> 00:14:16.521]  I mean, every few days I read about somebody who picks, you know, a pimple on their leg and two days later they're dead and flesh-eating bacteria has basically devoured much of their body.
[00:14:18.422 --> 00:14:21.023]  And they admit that is because of antibiotics.
[00:14:21.763 --> 00:14:23.504]  Now, that is a low-tech
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:31.445]  65-year-old technology, originally discovered in mold, penicillin.
[00:14:32.646 --> 00:14:46.616]  Now, they're developing vaccines and getting approval on them that, oh, if you take this vaccine in our double-blind studies, it shows a massive reduction in your desire to snort cocaine.
[00:14:47.941 --> 00:14:51.524]  Or it shows a massive reduction in your desire to smoke cigarettes.
[00:14:52.325 --> 00:14:53.025]  Or chew tobacco.
[00:14:53.506 --> 00:14:56.448]  But they don't look at what the other effects are.
[00:14:56.488 --> 00:14:58.070]  See, that's looking at it one-dimensionally.
[00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:04.095]  It's just, yep, this seemed to make people not want to use this particular drug.
[00:15:04.595 --> 00:15:08.919]  Because, and there's different variants of them, but the virus goes in, it
[00:15:12.259 --> 00:15:32.664]  either destroys those receptors in the brain or it creates plaques at those receptors or they have other types where your body creates an autoimmune response and then destroys whatever particular chemical that the vaccine is targeted towards creating an immunity.
[00:15:32.944 --> 00:15:39.046]  But the problem is the reason that cigarettes and marijuana
[00:15:42.438 --> 00:15:42.858]  Cannabis
[00:15:58.454 --> 00:16:05.495]  Vaccines that re-engineer the brain 12 years ago or so, and even in the medical journals they were saying, well, you know, there's concerns about this.
[00:16:06.536 --> 00:16:13.517]  But now they just sell them saying, look, we're doing tests of these, we're rolling these out, we're going to give you an anti-stress vaccine.
[00:16:14.037 --> 00:16:15.557]  You're not going to feel bad anymore.
[00:16:15.858 --> 00:16:17.198]  You're not going to have anxiety.
[00:16:18.158 --> 00:16:23.139]  Well, you naturally have anxiety over things that you should have anxiety about.
[00:16:24.156 --> 00:16:29.298]  I have anxiety over the fact that I still eat too much fattening food, that I don't exercise enough, that I work too hard.
[00:16:30.019 --> 00:16:43.945]  I have anxiety about having children, that I want to live to see have children, and that I want to be there to protect and help my children, and so I'm really trying to wrestle with myself to stop living the destructive lifestyle I live.
[00:16:44.246 --> 00:16:48.127]  It's not destructive compared to the general public, but I can see it as destructive.
[00:16:48.207 --> 00:16:48.968]  It was destructive
[00:16:49.628 --> 00:16:54.530]  Being so upset about the news I'm going to cover in 15 minutes, that I was unable to sleep last night.
[00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:58.592]  My wife got up at 2 in the morning and said, when the dog was barking, and said, what are you doing?
[00:16:59.492 --> 00:17:03.593]  And you know, I was already took another shower, was dressed, sitting there at the computer doing research.
[00:17:03.653 --> 00:17:04.734]  I said, I just can't sleep.
[00:17:09.537 --> 00:17:20.566]  But see, that's Alex Jones going to an extreme of concern about the New World Order at a subconscious level, feeling like, I've got to defeat this system myself when I can never do that.
[00:17:21.367 --> 00:17:24.970]  We can only do it with God's help, with divine intervention.
[00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:29.153]  We've got to have faith, do the right thing, tell the truth, take action, and then trust in God.
[00:17:30.454 --> 00:17:37.920]  All of us together doing little things, but getting back to this report here, there are so many super technologies
[00:17:38.951 --> 00:17:58.101]  Super high-tech, to use a comic book term, super science type systems that are being developed and when you realize the globalists are Malthusian and malevolent and that they are trying to deploy these to make us basically emotionless biological androids.
[00:17:58.141 --> 00:18:02.023]  That's how the Pentagon describes in their Marshall Report.
[00:18:03.376 --> 00:18:04.577]  Wired Magazine reported on it.
[00:18:04.597 --> 00:18:08.919]  The headline was Marshall Plan, a takeoff on the post-World War II plan.
[00:18:09.399 --> 00:18:11.380]  And the headline is The Marshall Plan.
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:15.442]  In the future, it won't be what weapons our troops have, but what drugs they're on.
[00:18:16.182 --> 00:18:24.847]  And we know that they're testing aggression drugs, high-tech steroids, amnesics on special forces.
[00:18:26.053 --> 00:18:31.419]  That's been confirmed, and a lot of other even more dangerous things on them.
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:36.765]  And we know now they're moving and setting the precedent to deploy things like Gardasil.
[00:18:37.574 --> 00:18:47.656]  That's caused close to 100 known deaths and tens of thousands of people to have serious Guillain-Barré type neurological disorders.
[00:18:48.496 --> 00:18:54.357]  And when the government pushed that on schoolgirls and now on boys, they knew in the trials it was killing people.
[00:18:54.978 --> 00:19:02.019]  But see, they're setting a precedent to deploy something to kill us out in the open and then just see if they can paper over it.
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:06.580]  Oh, man.
[00:19:08.755 --> 00:19:09.976]  And I know I'm all over the map.
[00:19:10.056 --> 00:19:12.599]  I'm all over the map because it's all interconnected.
[00:19:15.001 --> 00:19:20.147]  Do people realize the chain reactions that have already begun because of genetically modified crops?
[00:19:21.148 --> 00:19:31.699]  The German studies, the British, the Chinese studies all show one form of BT corn that grows a natural pesticide in it.
[00:19:33.578 --> 00:19:40.463]  That is, it's a natural fungus in the ground, but they put it in the plant about a thousand times the strength, so that any bugs that eat it will die.
[00:19:41.003 --> 00:19:46.047]  The problem is, honeybees are eating the pollen, and they're dying.
[00:19:46.147 --> 00:19:47.848]  I mean, why did the globalists deploy that?
[00:19:48.188 --> 00:19:53.332]  Why are they putting out systems that turn off major proteins in the body, not just flu viruses?
[00:19:54.072 --> 00:19:56.274]  I mean, it's like they're trying to destroy the planet.
[00:19:57.014 --> 00:19:57.575]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:00.177 --> 00:20:06.362]  This message starts with a great offer from Big Berkey Water Filters, because we don't want you drinking dangerous water one minute longer.

[00:22:01.184 --> 00:22:04.805]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:22:05.186 --> 00:22:08.207]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:22:08.447 --> 00:22:13.229]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:22:13.249 --> 00:22:19.491]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:22:19.631 --> 00:22:21.872]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:22:22.412 --> 00:22:22.692]  Tim Geithner?
[00:22:22.712 --> 00:22:23.153]  Bernanke?
[00:22:23.233 --> 00:22:23.694]  They're arsonists!
[00:22:23.714 --> 00:22:24.655]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:22:24.995 --> 00:22:27.418]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:22:41.314 --> 00:22:43.156]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:22:43.456 --> 00:22:48.220]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:57.708]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:22:59.821 --> 00:23:01.802]  Never buy home canning jar lids again!
[00:23:02.402 --> 00:23:02.902]  No kidding!
[00:23:03.082 --> 00:23:07.103]  When you buy Tadler Reusable Canning Lids once, you'll never buy canning lids ever again.
[00:23:07.444 --> 00:23:09.904]  Safely store emergency preparedness foods for years.
[00:23:10.205 --> 00:23:13.426]  Traditional metal lids are single-use throwaways containing BPA.
[00:23:13.666 --> 00:23:18.487]  But Tadler Reusable Canning Lids are guaranteed to last a lifetime when used as design for home canning.
[00:23:18.687 --> 00:23:25.410]  Tadler Lids are made with a USDA and FDA approved food grade plastic, safe for direct food contact, and contain no BPA.
[00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:29.491]  Tadler Lids are dishwasher safe, usable with standard pressure or water bath canning,
[00:23:29.631 --> 00:23:31.612]  Eliminate food spoilage from acid corrosion.
[00:23:31.752 --> 00:23:32.893]  Fit standard mason jars.
[00:23:33.093 --> 00:23:36.235]  Are indefinitely reusable and are proudly made in the USA.
[00:23:36.475 --> 00:23:39.057]  Place orders at ReusableCanningLids.com or call 1-877-747-2793.

[00:23:42.319 --> 00:23:43.319]  The original since 1976.
[00:24:03.849 --> 00:24:10.152]  I know a pilot and a scientific researcher.
[00:24:16.636 --> 00:24:24.461]  Personally for many years, and he called me yesterday and said, Alex, you can go to the federal maps of the magnetic fields.
[00:24:24.601 --> 00:24:25.662]  All pilots have them.
[00:24:26.162 --> 00:24:28.263]  Magnetic fields are routinely changing.
[00:24:28.604 --> 00:24:30.285]  There is nothing to this pole shift.
[00:24:31.826 --> 00:24:38.410]  And he wrote a report for us yesterday that's going up at Infowars.com in the next 30 minutes or so.
[00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:41.011]  Also at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:24:41.071 --> 00:24:44.454]  I'm not sure what headline we're going to give it yet, but during the next break I'm going to go out there and
[00:24:45.174 --> 00:24:47.218]  Decide what headline to give it.
[00:24:47.799 --> 00:24:52.549]  That doesn't mean that he's 100% right, but I do respect his opinion.
[00:24:53.992 --> 00:24:56.737]  The media, including Scientific American,
[00:24:58.015 --> 00:25:02.339]  And Fox News is hyping it up and saying that it could be a danger.
[00:25:02.359 --> 00:25:04.982]  And undoubtedly, polls do move around.
[00:25:05.042 --> 00:25:13.730]  But according to the graphs that we've looked at, it's about the same level of movement we've been seeing since measurements in the 1970s.
[00:25:14.331 --> 00:25:17.914]  So we're going to be going over that report coming up in the next hour.
[00:25:17.975 --> 00:25:20.777]  I know it's kind of fun to think Planet X is coming to kill us.
[00:25:21.738 --> 00:25:25.720]  It's kind of mysterious, like Thundar the Barbarian cartoon in the 70s.
[00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:32.522]  But, and there's all these movies about asteroids hitting us, but I don't think in 2012 there's going to be a big pulse shift.
[00:25:33.543 --> 00:25:36.084]  The globalists are engaged in a weather modification.
[00:25:36.144 --> 00:25:41.146]  They brag that they have tectonic weapons, which obviously are dangerous to manipulate the Earth with.
[00:25:41.626 --> 00:25:46.788]  The government and other governments have tested nukes in the upper atmosphere and blown holes in the ozone layer.
[00:25:47.848 --> 00:25:52.612]  A few years after they discovered and confirmed the Van Allen Radiation Belt, the U.S.
[00:25:52.652 --> 00:25:55.234]  government fired high-powered nuclear missiles into it.
[00:25:55.294 --> 00:26:05.663]  That's in the Discovery Channel, Trinity Special, with William Shatner, film footage of them launching multiple nukes into the Van Allen Radiation Belt, quote, trying to blow it up.
[00:26:05.903 --> 00:26:16.091]  So, I mean, the real danger is the globalists and their cyclotrons and their heavy superconducting super colliders and their
[00:26:17.301 --> 00:26:23.305]  The Air Force report seven years ago admitting that they're secretly trying to isolate and develop antimatter bombs.
[00:26:23.925 --> 00:26:31.930]  I mean, sure, there's some real dangers going on, but evidence of a pulse shift, I really think is a pop culture fad.
[00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:33.491]  People may get mad at me for that.
[00:26:33.851 --> 00:26:34.631]  That's my opinion.
[00:26:34.711 --> 00:26:35.812]  And I'm not sure either.
[00:26:35.852 --> 00:26:36.452]  We don't know.
[00:26:36.873 --> 00:26:38.654]  The only constant on this planet is change.
[00:26:38.774 --> 00:26:44.177]  Now, I told you that I learned something yesterday, so upsetting,
[00:26:46.567 --> 00:27:09.959]  Because I already had all the pieces and knew it was coming, but the announcement of it shook me to my very core, and I wanted to disprove all of my previous research that I had done over the years, so I spent approximately eight hours last night from midnight to 8 a.m.
[00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:13.491]  We're good to go.
[00:27:36.198 --> 00:27:44.586]  Then a new development happens, confirming all the research you've done, but then you say, well, time tends to muddy things a bit.
[00:27:45.026 --> 00:27:47.148]  Let me spend some time researching this.
[00:27:47.228 --> 00:27:57.698]  So, Paul Watson, Kurt Nemo, Aaron Dykes, and myself, as well as Rob Doob, worked late into the evening
[00:27:59.326 --> 00:28:27.144]  on the information you're about to see and this video slash audio for radio listeners was only finished twenty minutes ago and it's not on the internet yet it's not on the Alex Jones Channel it's not at PrisonPlanet.tv we're gonna premiere it when we come back after uh... this break here in a moment and please call your friends and family please tell them to tune in uh... to this information immediately
[00:28:28.347 --> 00:28:33.110]  Because this is a form of tyranny that no nation has ever had in place.
[00:28:34.571 --> 00:28:44.397]  And I don't just have all the public admissions, I have inside sources that do not wish to be named, but you can imagine who they are.
[00:28:44.717 --> 00:28:57.345]  I have worked inside three separate radio stations for long periods of time here in Austin, Texas, and I was told the information by engineers, and I was allowed to see the documents.
[00:28:59.167 --> 00:29:01.408]  And I was allowed to videotape some of the documents.
[00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:09.710]  Man, I can't believe it.
[00:29:10.550 --> 00:29:11.171]  It's so bad.
[00:29:11.871 --> 00:29:13.591]  They really are getting ready for martial law.
[00:29:14.171 --> 00:29:14.952]  You need to know that.
[00:29:14.972 --> 00:29:15.652]  You need to understand.
[00:29:15.692 --> 00:29:18.253]  This is not a game on this radio show.
[00:29:18.293 --> 00:29:19.773]  This is not infotainment.
[00:29:21.114 --> 00:29:22.434]  This is not a joke.
[00:29:24.174 --> 00:29:25.695]  They are planning hardcore tyranny.
[00:29:27.478 --> 00:29:28.960]  And we're gonna break it down.
[00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:29.680]  We come back.
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:31.222]  We're gonna go straight to the video.
[00:29:31.282 --> 00:29:31.962]  We come out of break.
[00:29:32.863 --> 00:29:33.584]  Slash audio.
[00:29:33.624 --> 00:29:36.226]  It'll be streaming at PrisonPlanet.tv for viewers there.
[00:29:36.727 --> 00:29:39.629]  For radio listeners, you'll be able to hear the entire video.
[00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:49.238]  And then later, you'll be able to go up to InfoWars.com and watch the video where every statement I make is government documents and mainstream news dealing with this huge issue.
[00:29:50.279 --> 00:29:51.200]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:53.181]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.197 --> 00:29:56.875]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.786 --> 00:30:05.427]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:30:05.767 --> 00:30:13.869]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:30:14.609 --> 00:30:18.650]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:30.052]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:30:30.692 --> 00:30:39.695]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:30:40.215 --> 00:30:45.277]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:30:45.637 --> 00:30:52.800]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:55.881]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:30:59.756 --> 00:31:00.897]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:31:00.937 --> 00:31:07.603]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:31:07.864 --> 00:31:10.146]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:31:10.426 --> 00:31:15.591]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:31:15.791 --> 00:31:18.572]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:31:18.832 --> 00:31:20.933]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:31:21.153 --> 00:31:27.075]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:31:27.395 --> 00:31:30.596]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:31:30.776 --> 00:31:36.298]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:31:36.558 --> 00:31:37.858]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:31:38.198 --> 00:31:39.359]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:31:39.499 --> 00:31:42.039]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:31:42.159 --> 00:31:43.580]  He explains everything you need to know.
[00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:46.223]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:31:46.383 --> 00:31:50.888]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:31:51.008 --> 00:31:53.450]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[00:31:53.611 --> 00:31:57.295]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:31:57.475 --> 00:31:58.476]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:31:59.855 --> 00:32:03.157]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:32:03.437 --> 00:32:04.517]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:32:04.737 --> 00:32:08.919]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:32:09.139 --> 00:32:14.782]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:32:15.062 --> 00:32:17.063]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:32:17.223 --> 00:32:19.964]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[00:32:20.264 --> 00:32:26.567]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[00:32:26.767 --> 00:32:28.548]  They both make fabulous investments.
[00:32:28.948 --> 00:32:34.030]  Food is our greatest dependency and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:39.292]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis and you can't eat paper, stocks or metals.
[00:32:39.572 --> 00:32:44.774]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious easy fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[00:32:44.934 --> 00:32:47.896]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[00:32:48.136 --> 00:32:51.097]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[00:32:51.117 --> 00:32:51.917]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[00:33:05.146 --> 00:33:07.167]  Devastating globalist lies.
[00:33:07.767 --> 00:33:11.387]  Exposing the mainstream media's propaganda machine.
[00:33:12.108 --> 00:33:14.808]  Tirelessly waging war on corruption.
[00:33:15.268 --> 00:33:19.069]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6 in Austin, Texas.
[00:33:19.609 --> 00:33:21.350]  Transmitting worldwide.
[00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:23.210]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:28.131]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:30.292 --> 00:33:31.432]  Are we seen here?
[00:33:33.886 --> 00:33:36.847]  This is a test of the emergency alert system.
[00:33:39.447 --> 00:33:44.648]  Executive Order 10995 allows the government to seize and control the communication media.
[00:33:45.129 --> 00:33:49.169]  Our nation is at war against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred.
[00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:53.230]  Training camps have been struck, leaders eliminated, plots disrupted.
[00:33:53.811 --> 00:33:58.712]  And all those involved in the attempted act of terrorism must know, you too will be held to account.
[00:33:59.232 --> 00:33:59.852]  Think about it.
[00:34:00.649 --> 00:34:08.912]  Fifteen years ago, we allowed the federal government to hardwire emergency takeover systems of all major communications and media in the United States.
[00:34:09.332 --> 00:34:13.613]  Now the federal government's coming out in the open and admitting what was already in their internal documents.
[00:34:14.033 --> 00:34:18.315]  That they're going to begin having federal break-ins over local news.
[00:34:18.595 --> 00:34:24.577]  If this had been an actual alert, this message would contain specific information on the watch or warning being issued.
[00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:33.271]  Well, it's really happening.
[00:34:34.111 --> 00:34:36.252]  Bonafide tyranny is coming to our shores.
[00:34:37.172 --> 00:34:41.514]  If you look at Egypt, you've witnessed how the government has seized control of the TV and radio stations.
[00:34:42.075 --> 00:34:44.896]  But in the United States, the federal government doesn't need to do that.
[00:34:45.456 --> 00:34:50.099]  Because under changes in FCC regulations over television and radio,
[00:34:51.119 --> 00:34:59.549]  In 1996, EAS emergency systems are put in at the radio or TV towers.
[00:34:59.929 --> 00:35:07.618]  They're also put in at the national and local cable systems, where the federal government puts a box in at the transmission tower.
[00:35:08.817 --> 00:35:20.504]  Where they can flip a switch and shortwave towers nationwide take over those computers and put out an audio signal of whatever message they want.
[00:35:21.244 --> 00:35:23.326]  I am a radio broadcaster.
[00:35:24.522 --> 00:35:33.664]  And I remember 15 years ago when this change was made, watching the engineer at the radio station where I worked and the station manager literally freaking out.
[00:35:34.184 --> 00:35:40.286]  They were sent documents that the FCC said were restricted, but I was allowed to look at them and I was allowed to videotape them.
[00:35:40.546 --> 00:35:44.046]  And I put it in my 1999 film, Police Day 2000.
[00:35:44.687 --> 00:35:46.107]  Well, my friends, you're looking
[00:35:47.742 --> 00:35:49.143]  At a FEMA control box.
[00:35:50.143 --> 00:35:54.726]  That's right, at 98.9 KJFKFM, where I work, in Austin, Texas.
[00:35:55.346 --> 00:35:58.268]  That, my friends, can take over the radio station.
[00:35:59.308 --> 00:36:02.230]  It is radio controlled by a FEMA tower.
[00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:05.311]  That's right, a FEMA tower in New Braunfels, Texas.
[00:36:06.512 --> 00:36:10.394]  It covers almost all of the central part of the state of Texas.
[00:36:11.687 --> 00:36:16.390]  Little teletypes come printing out of the side of the machine weekly and update us.
[00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:23.554]  In the past it was voluntary, now it's mandatory and they can, remote control, take over the station.
[00:36:24.314 --> 00:36:36.001]  And in those, they told them that in the near future the federal government would routinely seize control of their broadcast system, not during a plague or a nuclear attack or a war, but
[00:36:36.761 --> 00:36:39.544]  That they would seize control for routine announcements.
[00:36:40.165 --> 00:36:43.569]  So, it was put in place, but it wasn't implemented.
[00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:48.694]  Now, President Barack Obama, through the FCC, has announced today
[00:36:49.591 --> 00:36:57.596]  That they are going to begin testing and implementing national announcements with the President giving messages to the public.
[00:37:19.953 --> 00:37:20.736]  But it gets worse.
[00:37:22.734 --> 00:37:26.396]  Eight years ago, I was not doing my radio show out of the studio.
[00:37:26.417 --> 00:37:28.138]  I was doing it out of a local talk station.
[00:37:28.238 --> 00:37:29.398]  I didn't have my own studio then.
[00:37:29.839 --> 00:37:44.348]  They got new communiques from the FCC telling them that they should prepare in the near future for multiple hours per day of federal break-ins over the local AM station.
[00:37:44.809 --> 00:37:49.992]  And the same systems in the cable systems, broadcast TV, talk radio, you name it.
[00:37:50.493 --> 00:37:52.134]  And I went to the station manager.
[00:37:53.074 --> 00:37:56.417]  And I said, please come on my show, talk about this.
[00:37:57.037 --> 00:37:59.579]  And he said, no, I showed you this stuff in confidence.
[00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:00.940]  You're not allowed to talk about it.
[00:38:01.281 --> 00:38:02.942]  You can say you heard about it, but not where.
[00:38:04.603 --> 00:38:09.427]  Now, since then, I've done shows out of another big talk station here in town.
[00:38:09.867 --> 00:38:15.612]  I've been a guest in many stations around the country, over 80 stations now that pick up my syndicated radio show.
[00:38:17.509 --> 00:38:33.097]  In the last week, I have talked to station owners and managers who are now getting internal communiques from the FCC and they're told it's national security, that they're not allowed to talk about it, but that there are going to be more and more government break-ins over radio and TV.
[00:38:33.897 --> 00:38:35.018]  Now, I got that news.
[00:38:36.718 --> 00:38:46.682]  But was trying to figure out what to do with it when today the big announcement comes out and the FCC Obama spokes lady says, oh, this is no big deal.
[00:38:46.742 --> 00:38:48.222]  We've always had this in place.
[00:38:48.542 --> 00:38:49.883]  We're now just going to implement it.
[00:38:50.203 --> 00:38:51.123]  Well, I guess that's true.
[00:38:51.803 --> 00:38:54.184]  There are executive orders to seize all transportation.
[00:38:54.624 --> 00:38:58.126]  There are executive orders to put every American into forced labor brigades.
[00:38:58.606 --> 00:39:01.307]  There are executive orders to take over all the media.
[00:39:02.589 --> 00:39:05.415]  Under nuclear attack, under continuity of government.
[00:39:05.796 --> 00:39:09.924]  The point is, now, Obama is beginning to implement this.
[00:39:11.479 --> 00:39:18.562]  Before 1996, you had one local station that under an emergency situation would broadcast the EAS alert.
[00:39:19.082 --> 00:39:22.664]  Other stations would tune to that station and carry those emergency alerts.
[00:39:23.404 --> 00:39:37.950]  No country in the world, not communist Russia back during the Soviet Union pre-1991, not Ceausescu's Romania, none of them had actual boxes in the radio and TV stations that would take over
[00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:39.751]  The entire transmission.
[00:39:40.052 --> 00:39:45.197]  These are wired in under regulations to the broadcast towers and at the studios.
[00:39:45.677 --> 00:39:51.303]  Everything by law, and I've watched the engineers complain and bitch and moan for years, has to be wired through these.
[00:39:51.623 --> 00:39:53.165]  And it causes all sorts of problems.
[00:39:53.425 --> 00:40:00.072]  They have to do weekly checks, randomly, where the federal government tests the takeover of the station to make sure it's in place.
[00:40:00.712 --> 00:40:08.598]  This is happening in America, right as we go into a depression, right as foreign banks loot our country, right as they try to start new wars in the Middle East.
[00:40:08.778 --> 00:40:10.639]  Do you see what's happening?
[00:40:11.139 --> 00:40:11.920]  But it gets worse.
[00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:16.123]  FEMA began to put out press releases last year saying, you know what?
[00:40:16.703 --> 00:40:21.367]  We're going to have digital license plates across the country that have Most Wanted videos popping up.
[00:40:21.407 --> 00:40:22.527]  It'll be an LCD screen.
[00:40:23.588 --> 00:40:26.411]  And we're going to give you government announcements over those.
[00:40:26.751 --> 00:40:30.054]  You know those billboards we put up for Amber Alerts with kidnappable kids?
[00:40:30.395 --> 00:40:33.738]  Now it's going to be report illegal guns, report terrorism.
[00:40:34.278 --> 00:40:45.048]  They're putting in these giant telescreens at these 9,000 locations, Walmarts, malls, you name it, saying, don't trust other shoppers, don't trust your neighbors, only trust Big Brother, only trust the government.
[00:40:45.689 --> 00:40:55.332]  Napolitano comes and inserts herself at the Super Bowl, has the TSA running checkpoints with local trained goons actually doing frisk and feeling people up.
[00:40:55.432 --> 00:40:57.472]  We're going in to bondage.
[00:40:57.652 --> 00:41:06.055]  And now, in the midst of the accelerating global financial meltdown, the White House announces and says, oh, it's no big deal.
[00:41:06.915 --> 00:41:08.296]  We've had this on the books for years.
[00:41:08.776 --> 00:41:10.377]  Yeah, martial law plans for years.
[00:41:11.017 --> 00:41:15.780]  We're going to start testing the voice of Obama, breaking in on the media.
[00:41:16.641 --> 00:41:22.004]  And they're announcing that Xbox video games and other systems are going to have government announcements that pop up.
[00:41:22.264 --> 00:41:28.767]  Cass Sunstein, the regulations czar, has said that they want pop-ups on websites they don't agree with, with government messages.
[00:41:29.308 --> 00:41:32.650]  Google's already testing this, where it tells you, ooh, look out, going to this site.
[00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:34.691]  This information's been proven to be wrong.
[00:41:35.051 --> 00:41:39.113]  The internet kill switch, the cyber security takeover, it's all happening.
[00:41:39.773 --> 00:41:50.839]  They've got new FCC rules where all the alarm clocks and televisions have to have hardwired chips in them so they can fire your television or radio up and make you hear announcements in the middle of the night.
[00:41:51.219 --> 00:42:02.845]  They've also announced in this new press release that, oh, the FCC and the federal government are going to put in free national broadband that we pay for as taxpayers, but it's going to be under our filtered rules.
[00:42:03.854 --> 00:42:08.837]  In the free broadband in Europe at the bus and train stations, guess whose websites are censored?
[00:42:09.217 --> 00:42:11.138]  InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:42:11.478 --> 00:42:12.939]  What did Google announce two weeks ago?
[00:42:13.159 --> 00:42:20.924]  That they're going to start censoring and blocking out from their searches content farms like the Drudge Report and InfoWars.com.
[00:42:20.944 --> 00:42:23.706]  That is, sites that aggregate news and make comments on news.
[00:42:24.446 --> 00:42:28.468]  This is a full-spectrum takeover of the media in our country.
[00:42:28.728 --> 00:42:30.528]  This is an attack on free speech.
[00:42:30.568 --> 00:42:41.093]  This is literal government messages on digital billboards, at checkout counters, on your license plate, on your cell phone, on your pop-up video games.
[00:42:41.133 --> 00:42:49.316]  This is the federal government coming in and forcing their messages directly into the media because the population doesn't buy their propaganda anymore.
[00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:52.271]  There has been a continuity of agenda.
[00:42:52.291 --> 00:42:53.872]  This has been going on for decades.
[00:42:53.912 --> 00:42:55.033]  They've been setting the system up.
[00:42:55.373 --> 00:42:57.435]  But now, they're rolling it out.
[00:42:57.555 --> 00:42:58.796]  And that's the message here.
[00:42:59.196 --> 00:43:00.697]  What does it say about our society?
[00:43:01.377 --> 00:43:02.398]  This is unbelievable.
[00:43:02.658 --> 00:43:04.199]  This is the Fairness Doctrine 2.0.
[00:43:04.539 --> 00:43:12.105]  This is authoritarian censorship by way of government break-ins with announcements.
[00:43:12.325 --> 00:43:13.525]  No country's ever done this.
[00:43:13.866 --> 00:43:14.646]  This is beyond 1984.
[00:43:14.786 --> 00:43:17.248]  And it's really happening.
[00:43:17.928 --> 00:43:19.730]  Do people realize the magnitude of this?
[00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:32.699]  And in America, supposed land of freedom, I'm getting frantic calls from station owners and managers as they're being told to get ready for all this to happen in the last few weeks.
[00:43:33.179 --> 00:43:42.586]  And going back 8 years ago, and going back 15 years ago, when I get these documents as they put this system in place, the station owners are afraid to speak out.
[00:43:42.906 --> 00:43:45.348]  The station managers are afraid to speak out.
[00:43:45.768 --> 00:43:46.089]  Why?
[00:43:46.997 --> 00:43:47.397]  Why?
[00:43:47.837 --> 00:43:48.938]  We need to say no.
[00:43:49.038 --> 00:43:51.860]  This is a free market, free private property society.
[00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:56.282]  In the name of security, the government is hardwiring everything so they can take it over?
[00:43:57.563 --> 00:43:58.363]  Egypt, anybody?
[00:43:58.383 --> 00:44:00.725]  This is worse than what happened in Egypt.
[00:44:01.485 --> 00:44:02.686]  That's what Mubarak did.
[00:44:03.226 --> 00:44:04.407]  But he didn't have it hardwired.
[00:44:04.427 --> 00:44:06.548]  He physically had the army go take it over.
[00:44:07.421 --> 00:44:10.143]  This is as plain as the nose on my face.
[00:44:10.203 --> 00:44:13.945]  This is brazen, naked, hardcore, scary tyranny.
[00:44:14.345 --> 00:44:19.508]  And when I saw them announce this, even though I knew it was coming for all these years, it shook me to my very core.
[00:44:19.548 --> 00:44:20.589]  And it should shake you.
[00:44:21.289 --> 00:44:26.232]  When they put tyranny in place, they can take the pension funds, the veterans death benefits, that's already begun.
[00:44:27.293 --> 00:44:28.933]  They can jack up taxes.
[00:44:28.973 --> 00:44:31.274]  They can shut down newspapers, TV, radio.
[00:44:31.634 --> 00:44:33.634]  The last time this happened was during the Civil War.
[00:44:34.114 --> 00:44:37.855]  Lincoln did similar things, arresting scores of newspaper owners and editors.
[00:44:38.495 --> 00:44:39.135]  This is here.
[00:44:39.955 --> 00:44:41.796]  The globalists have committed so many crimes.
[00:44:41.836 --> 00:44:43.456]  They know they're unpopular with the people.
[00:44:43.736 --> 00:44:46.017]  They know Congress has an 11% approval rating.
[00:44:46.297 --> 00:44:52.058]  And so they are moving with a system to force their propaganda onto all private media in this country.
[00:44:53.038 --> 00:45:00.283]  And it's going to start with little short announcements and it's going to move until huge blocks of programming are openly taken over by the government.
[00:45:00.763 --> 00:45:04.706]  If we don't have free speech in the First Amendment and a free press in this country, we have nothing.
[00:45:05.146 --> 00:45:09.269]  The internet has been a wonderful tool to enlighten and inform and awaken the masses.
[00:45:09.809 --> 00:45:12.231]  But it's also a double-edged sword created by DARPA.
[00:45:13.447 --> 00:45:18.674]  Electronics, computer chips are so cheap, everything is being wired for the federal takeover.
[00:45:18.754 --> 00:45:19.576]  This is announced.
[00:45:20.176 --> 00:45:20.917]  This is a fact.
[00:45:21.418 --> 00:45:26.786]  We're entering a time when you're not going to be able to access Infowars.com and other alternative sites.
[00:45:26.806 --> 00:45:28.448]  We're already being blocked all over the world.
[00:45:28.688 --> 00:45:30.010]  They've already got the system in place.
[00:45:30.791 --> 00:45:36.872]  And that's scary enough, but if they send up this trial balloon and we go along with it, they are going to implement the full takeover of the media.
[00:45:37.272 --> 00:45:42.073]  Whether you're liberal, conservative, libertarian, communist, socialist, it doesn't matter.
[00:45:42.433 --> 00:45:45.754]  Atheist, Christian, all media is under attack.
[00:45:45.814 --> 00:45:48.655]  We must come together and resist this.
[00:45:49.555 --> 00:45:51.315]  We must say no to this.
[00:45:51.775 --> 00:45:54.296]  This is a major canary in the coal mine.
[00:45:55.287 --> 00:45:58.270]  This is a full-spectrum takeover of the media.
[00:45:58.650 --> 00:46:00.993]  Let's not let them pull that switch.
[00:46:01.353 --> 00:46:02.774]  Get the word out to everybody.
[00:46:03.935 --> 00:46:07.499]  I have been having chills for three hours since this announcement came out.
[00:46:07.939 --> 00:46:09.301]  I knew the hammer was going to drop.
[00:46:10.242 --> 00:46:11.723]  But this is so incredible.
[00:46:12.504 --> 00:46:16.668]  We've got to hang together for the First Amendment, or we're surely going to hang separate.
[00:46:17.308 --> 00:46:17.749]  Thank you.
[00:46:18.369 --> 00:46:19.230]  The rest is up to you.
[00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:19.931]  Please spread the word.
[00:46:25.331 --> 00:46:40.364]  It is now time for radio and TV station owners to stand up to this corruption, to this police state takeover of the First Amendment and private property, and let the system know they are not going to put up with the federal government's takeover of our media system.
[00:46:40.724 --> 00:46:41.885]  Enough is enough.
[00:46:44.159 --> 00:46:51.643]  Enough is enough, and that is the 13 minute video that we just showed here for the first time.
[00:46:51.683 --> 00:46:59.907]  It's not even on the web yet, we just streamed it out via PrisonPlanet.tv and on our AM and FM stations, XM and Global Shortwave.
[00:47:01.952 --> 00:47:07.414]  I know behind the scenes that station owners have been prepared for this for 15 years.
[00:47:08.794 --> 00:47:12.275]  Now they're being told, yes, the government is going to go ahead with this.
[00:47:12.415 --> 00:47:14.035]  There's always industry backlash.
[00:47:14.435 --> 00:47:26.319]  The government's saying they may take hours per day with different break-ins in the middle of a sports broadcast, the middle of the news, the middle of the weather, the middle of my radio show.
[00:47:27.455 --> 00:47:30.458]  They are at 9,000 locations putting the telescreens in.
[00:47:31.439 --> 00:47:35.382]  And it's not just Napolitano, it's other Homeland Security messages.
[00:47:36.203 --> 00:47:40.486]  The TSA obviously has gone from airports to sports stadiums and train stations.
[00:47:41.636 --> 00:47:43.196]  And that's all been announced.
[00:47:43.676 --> 00:47:47.657]  This is a full-spectrum government takeover of media.
[00:47:47.817 --> 00:47:49.098]  And let me expand on that.
[00:47:49.338 --> 00:47:50.438]  Here's Pop Science.
[00:47:50.718 --> 00:47:52.259]  AP also reported on this.
[00:47:53.039 --> 00:47:54.039]  This is from 2009.
[00:47:54.899 --> 00:48:05.162]  New York State wants to put emergency alerts in your online games, which is the way most games are played now, is in millions of people at a time, hundreds of thousands at a time, playing online games.
[00:48:05.542 --> 00:48:10.663]  And it shows examples of terror threat alerts popping up on your computer screen.
[00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:12.851]  It continues.
[00:48:15.192 --> 00:48:37.148]  We have all these different reports here about how they're going to have billboards all over the place, which that's the first rollout at the 800-plus Walmarts, and then they announced 8,000-plus locations, Mall of America, with big screens, with government messages, with audio, forcing you at the checkout counter to spend your time with Janet Napolitano and FEMA.
[00:48:37.708 --> 00:48:47.976]  And Homeland Security, forcing you to listen to them on the radio, forcing you over your handheld computer device to get audio and text alerts from them.
[00:48:49.337 --> 00:48:50.898]  Just injecting the fear.
[00:48:51.318 --> 00:48:59.625]  And then always with this system, they started out for Al-Qaeda, because everybody hates Al-Qaeda, and then next it's illegal guns.
[00:49:00.125 --> 00:49:02.867]  Next it's burning trash in your backyard.
[00:49:03.087 --> 00:49:04.188]  It's environmental crimes.
[00:49:04.268 --> 00:49:05.129]  It's the Green Police.
[00:49:05.669 --> 00:49:10.054]  This is the normalization of a high-tech 1984 society.
[00:49:10.375 --> 00:49:15.701]  By the way, Kurt Nimmo did a story on this that just went up in the last 20 minutes at InfoWars.com.
[00:49:15.741 --> 00:49:18.524]  We're going to get it posted over at PrisonPlanet.com as well.
[00:49:18.985 --> 00:49:21.628]  Obama launches total takeover of media.
[00:49:22.575 --> 00:49:27.217]  And that's also the name of the video we're going to be posting to YouTube that you just saw and heard here.
[00:49:28.317 --> 00:49:34.000]  And Nemo begins the article by saying, even the Washington Post describes it like something out of Orwell's 1984.
[00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:38.781]  And he has a link to the Washington Post, but they're like, oh, it's fun!
[00:49:39.302 --> 00:49:39.942]  It's good!
[00:49:39.982 --> 00:49:40.322]  It's like 1984!
[00:49:40.462 --> 00:49:42.483]  It's fun!
[00:49:42.503 --> 00:49:48.785]  Oh, there's going to be telescreens on the highways and in the town squares and in all the shops.
[00:49:48.825 --> 00:49:49.826]  And these are now going in.
[00:49:50.626 --> 00:49:59.195]  We're getting the video sent to us of Walmart super centers everywhere, and every checkout line just telling you, watch out, terrorists are everywhere, watch out, the internet's not safe.
[00:50:00.016 --> 00:50:10.206]  The announcements that are being played on these systems are also at the YouTube channel of Homeland Security, and they've got a whole string of them now saying, TSA cannot always be here to protect you.
[00:50:10.666 --> 00:50:18.517]  But we're going to try, and then it shows TSA at football games and things, just where people are watching screens being prepared.
[00:50:19.198 --> 00:50:27.490]  Again, first they prepare you via the television screen, what people see as not reality, for the physical rollout, so we're acclimated to accept it.
[00:50:29.016 --> 00:50:34.820]  And we've got to get station owners and station managers and others to start saying no to this.
[00:50:35.701 --> 00:50:43.567]  This is a major trial balloon they're launching and this is about taking over the alternative media, the internet, everything.
[00:50:43.607 --> 00:50:44.728]  It's so serious.
[00:50:46.609 --> 00:50:47.390]  They're really
[00:50:49.542 --> 00:50:54.032]  Now implementing all these executive orders and things that have been on the books for decades.
[00:50:54.674 --> 00:50:59.184]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with more on Obama and the launching of the total takeover.
[00:51:00.746 --> 00:51:03.848]  Forget everything you've been told about long-term food storage.
[00:51:04.089 --> 00:51:11.334]  When all hell breaks loose, you'll need the single most effective way to get high-powered Delta Force nutrients to your family, fast.
[00:51:12.074 --> 00:51:14.796]  Like any Special Forces commando, you need a plan.
[00:51:15.177 --> 00:51:17.398]  You need a Black Hawk Down food plan.
[00:51:17.719 --> 00:51:20.821]  Introducing the Survival Sprout Bank from Solutions from Science.
[00:51:21.101 --> 00:51:22.862]  It's your countertop survival garden.
[00:51:23.142 --> 00:51:27.385]  Yes, grow fresh greens right on your countertop in just a few short days.
[00:51:27.725 --> 00:51:34.549]  Sprouts are the green shoots that emerge from newly germinated seeds, and they are powerhouses of living, easily absorbed nutrients.
[00:51:34.789 --> 00:51:38.171]  The Survival Sprout Bank is a complete kit with nothing else to buy.
[00:51:38.391 --> 00:51:42.674]  And with sprouts so easy to grow, even children can grow emergency food.
[00:51:42.794 --> 00:51:44.195]  Call 877-327-0365 or go to survivalsproutbank.com.
[00:51:44.235 --> 00:51:44.455]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:51:50.038 --> 00:52:02.161]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:52:02.241 --> 00:52:04.421]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:52:04.441 --> 00:52:07.322]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:07.762 --> 00:52:12.523]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:12.863 --> 00:52:17.064]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:17.384 --> 00:52:19.707]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:19.727 --> 00:52:22.250]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:22.610 --> 00:52:25.193]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:25.533 --> 00:52:33.122]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:33.462 --> 00:52:38.727]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:38.847 --> 00:52:41.650]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:41.710 --> 00:52:45.133]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:45.394 --> 00:52:46.315]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:46.475 --> 00:52:47.776]  You're everyone else.
[00:52:47.796 --> 00:52:48.797]  Invisible Empire.

[00:52:59.454 --> 00:53:03.917]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.
[00:53:04.137 --> 00:53:12.783]  As an authorized Berkey dealer for over five years and serving thousands of satisfied customers, the Berkey guy offers amazing specials for Berkey water filtration systems.

[00:54:20.582 --> 00:54:49.232]  So, the federal government, through the continuity of government systems set up back in the 50s for nuclear war, has quietly rolled out a system through cybersecurity, already being put in place despite the fact that cybersecurity hasn't been officially passed by Congress, and they're admitting that they are hardwiring government takeover systems into all of the ISPs, where they can overlay messages on all websites, all cell phones, all online,
[00:54:50.273 --> 00:54:52.856]  Uh, cooperative play video games.
[00:54:53.557 --> 00:55:06.173]  They've already put the systems in, as of 15 years ago, with the Telecommunications Act, at all broadcast TV, cable, even though the FCC's supposedly not really over that, and radio.
[00:55:06.994 --> 00:55:13.496]  And it doesn't matter if we're on WWCR, the big 100,000 watt shortwave in Tennessee, they've got it wired.
[00:55:13.896 --> 00:55:17.557]  It doesn't matter if we're on 590 AM here in Austin, they've got it wired.
[00:55:18.198 --> 00:55:25.180]  And we just accept this and the stations pay their taxes to then have this forced on them
[00:55:26.744 --> 00:55:27.384]  It's incredible.
[00:55:28.025 --> 00:55:32.928]  And previous to 96, they had a government frequency they would tune to during the emergency.
[00:55:32.968 --> 00:55:39.332]  And one local station would have the takeover box in it, and then other stations would tune to that, only in case of a nuclear war.
[00:55:39.912 --> 00:55:42.614]  Then they passed the Amber Alerts, which sounds reasonable.
[00:55:42.654 --> 00:55:47.958]  If there's a missing little girl, they'll have billboards, digital billboards, radio announcements, TV announcements.
[00:55:48.598 --> 00:55:49.959]  But now you see the billboards.
[00:55:49.979 --> 00:55:55.743]  Where I live here in Austin, it will say, report environmental crimes, report illegal guns, report terrorist.
[00:55:56.583 --> 00:56:20.297]  uh... they are using this system and and now forcing into those any doubts into the stores into the markets in the malls into the city squares in town squares where you're just bombarded by government media that you pay for with your tax money this is the dream of dictators like stalin and hitler and shell chescue and poll pot
[00:56:20.857 --> 00:56:22.118]  And Fidel Castro.
[00:56:22.658 --> 00:56:33.463]  And in classical tyrannies, the government controls the media, but sometimes the media doesn't do what they want, so they send the police or military to the outfit to take it over.
[00:56:33.883 --> 00:56:34.543]  This is different.
[00:56:34.964 --> 00:56:46.489]  This is government developing its own news packages and forcing it into the checkout lines at Walmart and Mall of America, forcing it onto your cell phone, bombarding you, breaking into your life.
[00:56:47.009 --> 00:56:50.772]  And being able to shut the media off and completely take it over.
[00:56:51.053 --> 00:56:57.598]  And the federal government now admits the Pentagon has built giant TV studios for just that event and has created...
[00:56:58.869 --> 00:57:19.942]  Armed services television and they've got backup units now through FEMA television to totally take over and now they're getting you ready for it saying yes, during an economic emergency, remember Bush signed that executive order, Obama continued it, for any emergency including economic they can seize control of the entire infrastructure and Congress can say nothing for six months.
[00:57:20.562 --> 00:57:23.064]  Remember three years ago when I freaked out when Bush did that?
[00:57:23.848 --> 00:57:32.395]  And we said, I don't know if they're going to pull full martial law, but they're putting troops on the streets, running checkpoints, TSA, Viper teams, getting us all acclimated.
[00:57:33.636 --> 00:57:37.459]  But before they do it, they'll start coming out and testing it.
[00:57:37.559 --> 00:57:39.681]  Well, now the testing is here.
[00:57:40.782 --> 00:57:44.305]  They could take over five years from now or next month or tomorrow night.
[00:57:45.492 --> 00:57:49.693]  The point is, that sword of Damocles is now hanging over us.
[00:57:50.594 --> 00:57:52.694]  And this is all run by FEMA.
[00:57:52.894 --> 00:57:54.135]  Now, what did FEMA do?
[00:57:54.555 --> 00:58:01.817]  And this was on Good Morning America with the county parish sheriff of the New Orleans county that New Orleans is in.
[00:58:02.257 --> 00:58:04.978]  And he went on TV and broke down and cried and told the truth.
[00:58:05.818 --> 00:58:07.119]  And he said he had officers.
[00:58:08.834 --> 00:58:13.586]  Who were not allowed by the feds to go in and get their families out of the nursing home.
[00:58:15.370 --> 00:58:16.974]  And the grandmother had a phone working.
[00:58:18.300 --> 00:58:19.741]  And called and said, are you coming to get me?
[00:58:19.761 --> 00:58:21.461]  And they said, we're coming to get you, we're coming to get you.
[00:58:21.481 --> 00:58:23.462]  And two days later, we're coming to get you, we're coming to get you.
[00:58:23.482 --> 00:58:24.043]  They won't let us.
[00:58:24.623 --> 00:58:26.504]  Four days later, they go, they get her, she's dead.
[00:58:27.064 --> 00:58:29.165]  Then he broke down and he said, FEMA sabotaged us.
[00:58:29.345 --> 00:58:31.186]  They came in and cut the communication lines.
[00:58:31.366 --> 00:58:33.027]  They did it the first night when the storm hit.
[00:58:33.827 --> 00:58:35.227]  They ran that whole thing.
[00:58:35.288 --> 00:58:39.089]  Just like they want to cut local police lines, they've got grids in to take it all over.
[00:58:43.631 --> 00:58:47.593]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:49.895 --> 00:58:54.118]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:58:54.438 --> 00:58:55.058]  Number one.
[00:58:55.358 --> 00:58:58.500]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:58.781 --> 00:58:59.341]  Number two.
[00:58:59.641 --> 00:59:04.184]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:04.524 --> 00:59:04.965]  It's true.
[00:59:05.265 --> 00:59:09.828]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:10.148 --> 00:59:10.688]  Number three.
[00:59:10.968 --> 00:59:14.250]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:59:14.551 --> 00:59:18.253]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:59:18.453 --> 00:59:18.994]  Number 4.
[00:59:19.254 --> 00:59:21.616]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:59:22.016 --> 00:59:25.400]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:59:25.700 --> 00:59:26.220]  Number 5.
[00:59:26.481 --> 00:59:30.404]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:59:30.624 --> 00:59:35.389]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:00:04.676 --> 01:00:05.296]  Big Brother.
[01:00:05.977 --> 01:00:06.997]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:07.737 --> 01:00:08.878]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.498 --> 01:00:10.319]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.099 --> 01:00:12.060]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:16.262]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.822 --> 01:00:20.884]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:27.585 --> 01:00:29.767]  We're now into our number two.
[01:00:29.787 --> 01:00:31.890]  We have a lot of important news coming up.
[01:00:31.970 --> 01:00:35.414]  Ron Paul on verge of announcing 2012 presidential bid.
[01:00:36.795 --> 01:00:37.636]  We're drafting him.
[01:00:38.397 --> 01:00:39.278]  Einstein was right.
[01:00:39.298 --> 01:00:44.003]  Honeybee collapse threatens global food safety and security.
[01:00:44.063 --> 01:00:46.246]  That's just one of the reports we're going to get into.
[01:00:46.947 --> 01:00:48.889]  It's all coming up today.
[01:00:51.872 --> 01:01:21.074]  But I'm going to have Aaron Dykes in here in studio because he's done deep research, as have I, about the FEMA martial law executive order takeover grid that has been put in at all the internet hubs, all the broadcast TV and radio stations, the government now announcing that they're going to start breaking in to broadcast with a see something, say something DHS with the president, with Janet Napolitano, and others.
[01:01:22.366 --> 01:01:25.911]  The Soviets didn't try this and they have the technology to break in over radio and TV.
[01:01:27.093 --> 01:01:36.606]  This is unbelievable and it is the opposite of a free society and I'd like to open the phones up only
[01:01:38.257 --> 01:01:47.081]  Only in this hour, and I'm going to cover other news as well, but only for station owners or managers or program directors.
[01:01:47.101 --> 01:01:54.705]  You don't have to say who you are, but it'd be nice in a free country, couldn't you say what station you are and that you don't like the FCC control box?
[01:01:54.745 --> 01:01:59.747]  What, you're not allowed to criticize that they're now going to be taking over your station and breaking in routinely?
[01:02:00.107 --> 01:02:01.528]  See how cowed we've become?
[01:02:02.836 --> 01:02:04.498]  I'd like to hear from station managers.
[01:02:05.479 --> 01:02:09.584]  Only station managers or program directors or owners or engineers.
[01:02:11.246 --> 01:02:12.548]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:02:12.568 --> 01:02:12.608]  800-259-9231.
[01:02:12.628 --> 01:02:13.850]  Are you concerned about this?
[01:02:22.861 --> 01:02:28.843]  FEMA went on Federal News Radio, that's a group of stations in the D.C.
[01:02:29.103 --> 01:02:34.365]  slash Maryland-Virginia area, and basically announced all of this yesterday.
[01:02:34.685 --> 01:02:37.907]  We already had all of the public FEMA admissions.
[01:02:39.967 --> 01:02:42.628]  Here's InfoWars.com from April 11, 2005.
[01:02:42.728 --> 01:02:44.649]  FEMA test digital alert system.
[01:02:45.329 --> 01:02:48.150]  Here's PopScience.
[01:02:48.671 --> 01:02:51.952]  New York State wants to put emergency alerts in your online games.
[01:02:53.442 --> 01:03:04.790]  They've also tried to push FCC regulations that all clock radios have, quote, weather alerts, but really that's a chip receiver where they artificially flip your... This is already happening to people.
[01:03:04.810 --> 01:03:06.751]  People are already... I get calls all the time.
[01:03:06.791 --> 01:03:09.213]  I see it in the news where they're breaking in more and more.
[01:03:09.693 --> 01:03:11.094]  People's radios are turning on.
[01:03:11.334 --> 01:03:13.196]  People are getting messages on their televisions.
[01:03:13.456 --> 01:03:14.477]  This is all admitted.
[01:03:15.017 --> 01:03:20.442]  This is a total, incremental takeover, but the total takeover system is in place.
[01:03:20.783 --> 01:03:24.827]  Notice our headline, Obama launches total takeover of media.
[01:03:27.209 --> 01:03:32.814]  And the actual headline I gave to Kurt was, Obama launches total media takeover system.
[01:03:34.556 --> 01:03:39.140]  So let's, I know Kurt's working from home today, let's change that headline, now that I look at it.
[01:03:41.186 --> 01:03:42.687]  I was working with him on this story this morning.
[01:03:42.727 --> 01:03:45.287]  It's Obama launches total media takeover system.
[01:03:45.788 --> 01:03:48.149]  Obama launches total media takeover system.
[01:03:48.429 --> 01:03:50.669]  He's launching the media takeover system.
[01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:54.891]  He's not launching the total media takeover.
[01:03:55.531 --> 01:03:56.692]  But I guess technically they are.
[01:03:58.252 --> 01:03:59.653]  I don't know what headline you think this ought to be.
[01:03:59.953 --> 01:04:04.194]  Obama launches total media... Obama launches total takeover of media?
[01:04:05.515 --> 01:04:08.716]  Or should it be Obama launches total media takeover system?
[01:04:09.875 --> 01:04:17.373]  Because that's what's happening is they're rolling out the total media takeover system.
[01:04:18.769 --> 01:04:19.169]  Right now.
[01:04:19.790 --> 01:04:23.452]  And again, this report is up on InfoWars.com.
[01:04:23.792 --> 01:04:25.513]  But I want to hear from station engineers.
[01:04:26.093 --> 01:04:28.375]  I want to hear from station managers, program directors.
[01:04:28.415 --> 01:04:29.915]  I know we're on affiliates all over the country.
[01:04:30.296 --> 01:04:31.857]  We have to be able to talk about this.
[01:04:32.557 --> 01:04:36.299]  And the moves by the FCC to try to take over the Internet and regulate it.
[01:04:36.339 --> 01:04:38.520]  And the moves to try to restrict our free speech.
[01:04:38.961 --> 01:04:39.781]  This is our right.
[01:04:39.821 --> 01:04:40.562]  This is fundamental.
[01:04:40.602 --> 01:04:45.685]  It's our duty to stand up and say no to this system.
[01:04:46.687 --> 01:04:48.808]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[01:04:48.868 --> 01:04:50.968]  Aaron Dice is going to be talking about this with me in studio.
[01:04:51.388 --> 01:04:55.750]  Tyrell Ventura is going to be joining us to talk about his father's lawsuit and a lot more.
[01:04:55.770 --> 01:04:56.190]  Stay with us.
[01:05:00.051 --> 01:05:01.672]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:01.712 --> 01:05:04.512]  You've heard me talk about Cal Bend 5 Star Soaps for years.

[01:05:54.817 --> 01:05:55.277]  Thank you!
[01:05:59.807 --> 01:06:02.090]  Folks, you've heard us talk about Home Gain before.

[01:06:59.477 --> 01:07:02.780]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:04.141]  It ended on June of 2009.
[01:07:04.361 --> 01:07:08.545]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[01:07:08.765 --> 01:07:14.410]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[01:07:14.711 --> 01:07:16.692]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[01:07:16.852 --> 01:07:19.535]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[01:07:19.875 --> 01:07:26.179]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoodsDirect.

[01:07:28.580 --> 01:07:33.663]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[01:07:33.923 --> 01:07:38.906]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.

[01:07:57.814 --> 01:08:05.095]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:05.415 --> 01:08:07.756]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:07.776 --> 01:08:12.917]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[01:08:12.977 --> 01:08:13.437]  to 2 p.m.
[01:08:13.477 --> 01:08:15.238]  Central Standard Time, we're here live
[01:08:16.516 --> 01:08:20.379]  Come back Sundays for a live two-hour transmission, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:08:20.419 --> 01:08:20.779]  Central.
[01:08:21.179 --> 01:08:22.800]  We're talking about the future of the media.
[01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:32.867]  You've all now, we talked about it a decade ago when DARPA began to announce it, but now it's mainstream news, so people don't laugh at us, about the Internet kill switch, the Pentagon-run kill switch.
[01:08:32.907 --> 01:08:34.648]  They call it the Obama kill switch.
[01:08:34.728 --> 01:08:38.231]  Shutting the Internet off, like Egypt did, to save the Internet.
[01:08:38.551 --> 01:08:43.775]  And, oh, we've got to put this in place because of the Stuxnet worm, which our own government admits they launched with Israel.
[01:08:44.676 --> 01:08:48.377]  So our government launches this worm and then says they've got to take the web over because of it.
[01:08:48.757 --> 01:08:55.800]  They're announcing, and it's starting, they're going to put hardwired systems inside the chips of your phones.
[01:08:55.820 --> 01:09:00.261]  They're already in place under the Telecommunications Act that the phones be compatible with this by 2001.
[01:09:00.301 --> 01:09:02.522]  That's now 10 years ago.
[01:09:02.822 --> 01:09:03.722]  But they announced all this in 1996.
[01:09:05.643 --> 01:09:06.924]  And I've been warning people since then.
[01:09:07.184 --> 01:09:18.050]  Your phones, your computers, your television, your digital alarm clock, your local AM and FM radio stations, your local UHF, VHF cable.
[01:09:18.690 --> 01:09:29.316]  At the transmission tower, or at the transmission point, at the cable system, at the radio station, shortwave, AM, FM, digital, it doesn't matter.
[01:09:30.496 --> 01:09:34.619]  Under federal regulations, since 96, there are hardwired boxes.
[01:09:35.717 --> 01:09:40.120]  That everything has to go through in case of a nuclear war, then they would give you announcements.
[01:09:40.161 --> 01:09:47.306]  But now they admit they're setting up a top-down system where the president will start making announcements and so will FEMA and Homeland Security.
[01:09:47.927 --> 01:09:53.771]  You notice at 9,000 locations, first it's 846, then a week later they go, no, it's 9,000 locations.
[01:09:53.811 --> 01:09:57.794]  Now they're saying, oh, it's actually 16,000 locations.
[01:09:57.854 --> 01:09:59.015]  I needed to correct that.
[01:09:59.055 --> 01:10:00.216]  I saw this weekend, it's now 16,000.
[01:10:01.457 --> 01:10:02.958]  I mean, will it be 50,000 next?
[01:10:03.058 --> 01:10:03.979]  It's exponential.
[01:10:04.279 --> 01:10:06.081]  They're training the clergy response teams.
[01:10:06.101 --> 01:10:08.063]  We got those secret documents six years ago.
[01:10:08.423 --> 01:10:10.505]  People didn't believe it, even though it had FEMA phone numbers.
[01:10:10.805 --> 01:10:18.652]  Then three years later, they put out newscasts saying, yes, we're training your preachers during martial law to tell you to submit to government and to turn your guns in.
[01:10:18.872 --> 01:10:20.213]  We've had those preachers on.
[01:10:20.513 --> 01:10:22.855]  We've had the sheriffs on that have carried out the training.
[01:10:23.336 --> 01:10:26.498]  One of them apologized for it and said he didn't realize how serious it was.
[01:10:27.299 --> 01:10:35.824]  And now Obama is announcing that he's going to be on telescreens at Walmart, and at malls, and at grocery stores, and on the side of the highway.
[01:10:36.204 --> 01:10:38.285]  Big digital screens with loudspeakers.
[01:10:39.405 --> 01:10:42.947]  When you're playing online video games, they're going to be breaking in with messages.
[01:10:42.987 --> 01:10:51.372]  California's going to test it out with FEMA, where you have a digital LCD screen that actually has a tracker system in it as your license plate with
[01:10:52.292 --> 01:11:04.361]  Government messages that are wirelessly transmitted to it, so you see most wanted announcements, advertisements to raise money, making your car become an advertisement, and then terror alerts.
[01:11:04.501 --> 01:11:05.522]  I mean, this is beyond 1984.
[01:11:06.943 --> 01:11:11.146]  And even the Washington Post describes it like 1984, but says it's a good 1984.
[01:11:11.747 --> 01:11:18.192]  That's the first link in Kurt Nemo's article, Obama launches total takeover of media.
[01:11:18.832 --> 01:11:20.674]  Total takeover of media.
[01:11:21.054 --> 01:11:27.859]  They're launching the total takeover system to be able to take over media, and now seeing if we'll go along with this.
[01:11:27.899 --> 01:11:34.504]  Now, I notice we got Ben, Sean, Chris, and others that are station owners, managers, traffic directors, people like that.
[01:11:34.585 --> 01:11:37.447]  I'm going to get to you, and I appreciate you being there.
[01:11:37.467 --> 01:11:39.508]  I wanted to get a brief report from Aaron Deitch.
[01:11:40.149 --> 01:11:44.813]  If you want to call in, only station managers, owners, engineers especially,
[01:11:45.573 --> 01:11:46.094]  800-259-9231.
[01:11:46.114 --> 01:11:46.655]  800-259-9231.
[01:11:46.975 --> 01:12:03.294]  I want to get your take on this, but if there's any doubts, in Kurt Nemo's article, it is filled with documentation, in Aaron Dykes' video, that he stayed up all night to put together.
[01:12:03.375 --> 01:12:04.035]  Hasn't slept.
[01:12:05.316 --> 01:12:16.344]  When we saw this announcement by Obama yesterday through Federal News Radio, and they had the spokesman from FEMA on saying, yes, we've always had this power, yeah, during a nuclear attack, to make these announcements.
[01:12:16.404 --> 01:12:18.805]  Now you're not just going to hear the test, the brank, brank, brank.
[01:12:19.025 --> 01:12:20.506]  This is an emergency alert system.
[01:12:20.526 --> 01:12:21.487]  This is only a test.
[01:12:21.507 --> 01:12:24.189]  If this was an actual emergency, you would stand by for announcements.
[01:12:24.549 --> 01:12:30.212]  Now you're going to start getting the announcements that there's terrorists everywhere, and watch your neighbor, and support your dear leader.
[01:12:30.553 --> 01:12:33.715]  This is the government taking over the media, forcing its way in.
[01:12:34.495 --> 01:12:45.860]  And I remember, again, eight years ago, station managers, one guy manages a whole string of stations around the country, but they were carrying my show, doing my show out of there.
[01:12:46.221 --> 01:12:51.823]  It wasn't 98.9, it's not 590, I've gotten reports from those as well over the years, both places I worked.
[01:12:52.243 --> 01:12:57.366]  But from this particular station, and I'm not going to name them, people can figure out which one it was if they're Austin listeners.
[01:12:58.246 --> 01:13:04.491]  I was allowed to see the latest stuff, and they were freaking out in this meeting going, they're telling us to get ready for government announcements in the future.
[01:13:04.791 --> 01:13:08.975]  But there was industry pressure, people said this is outrageous, so it didn't happen then.
[01:13:09.695 --> 01:13:15.060]  It's now happening, and if we don't scream and yell about this, they're going to be able to get away with this.
[01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:18.763]  But remember, anytime they want, your cell phone, your computer,
[01:13:20.283 --> 01:13:38.568]  The newest clock radios, the cable that goes into your house, everything, radio, TV, broadcast, cable, all of it, the government can flip a switch and take it all over anytime they want, and they're saying in the Associated Press, in Reuters, and Aaron's video has all these articles in it,
[01:13:39.608 --> 01:13:41.149]  Should Obama control the Internet?
[01:13:41.209 --> 01:13:42.650]  Well, yes, to say that he should.
[01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:44.010]  Total kill switch.
[01:13:44.290 --> 01:13:50.313]  They may shut the web off to protect it, but they're going to incrementally get you trained that it's their right to do it first.
[01:13:50.633 --> 01:13:55.956]  So we're going to Ben, Sean, Chris, and others who work inside radio stations here in just a moment.
[01:13:56.076 --> 01:13:56.416]  Again, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:14:00.638 --> 01:14:02.240]  To hear from engineers and others.
[01:14:02.260 --> 01:14:10.569]  But Aaron, going over the research last night, because we already knew all of this, it was the fact that they're now, they put it in place already, now they're getting the public ready for it.
[01:14:10.850 --> 01:14:12.612]  What was it like for you to see this information?
[01:14:13.871 --> 01:14:18.792]  Yeah, the thing that strikes me the most is the continuity of agenda behind the whole thing.
[01:14:19.432 --> 01:14:23.633]  This particular executive order was set up by Bush, but Obama gets to implement it.
[01:14:24.293 --> 01:14:32.435]  But more, we've seen Napolitano and this Homeland Security see something coming out of nowhere, but it really integrates with this warning program.
[01:14:32.915 --> 01:14:42.478]  And from a technical standpoint, this thing goes off of XML priorities, so any priority will override the system, either at the local, regional, or whatever level.
[01:14:43.938 --> 01:14:45.180]  No, everything's hard-coded.
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:53.227]  But they've watered the terrorism down so vaguely so that it's anything suspicious, even when there's no credible, you know, information that there could be an attack.
[01:14:53.247 --> 01:14:55.169]  And they're doing drills with military and police.
[01:14:55.549 --> 01:15:00.274]  If there's a backfire from a car, they lock everything down, and they're training us for these lockdowns.
[01:15:00.956 --> 01:15:06.340]  Yeah, and if things do go to a full martial law level, it's going to bypass the police right away.
[01:15:07.121 --> 01:15:09.582]  I've got a report here from SpectraRep.
[01:15:10.703 --> 01:15:11.984]  And by the way, what happened at FEMA?
[01:15:12.364 --> 01:15:13.285]  What happened at Katrina?
[01:15:13.385 --> 01:15:15.407]  And I've had the local officials on.
[01:15:17.248 --> 01:15:17.589]  I mean...
[01:15:37.731 --> 01:15:42.692]  In fact, later we'll play the sheriff from the county that New Orleans is in saying this.
[01:15:42.712 --> 01:15:43.192]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:15:43.652 --> 01:15:57.475]  No, but this November 2010 report about this current installment of alerts mentions how, for example, a roadside sign may be programmed to wake up if the response is to evacuate, but not to wake up if it's for shelter.
[01:15:57.815 --> 01:16:02.756]  So in other words, these amber alert signs are going to go live whenever they punch the alert.
[01:16:02.796 --> 01:16:04.676]  And they admitted it was never about the little girl.
[01:16:05.316 --> 01:16:07.537]  It was like, oh, we're taking all the media over for the little girl.
[01:16:07.617 --> 01:16:08.958]  No, it's about total control.
[01:16:09.018 --> 01:16:13.981]  And now they admit in this Obama press release, he's going to be making announcements at you daily.
[01:16:14.561 --> 01:16:17.943]  You're not going to just hear stations that want to carry the presidential address once a week.
[01:16:17.963 --> 01:16:19.223]  You're going to have to listen to him.
[01:16:19.423 --> 01:16:23.786]  You're going to have to see him and Napolitano when you're at Walmart checkout lines.
[01:16:24.758 --> 01:16:31.003]  Yeah, and it's interesting, there's a quote related to Bush's signing in 2006, this Executive Order 13407.
[01:16:31.344 --> 01:16:40.792]  He says, this alert system is in part to ensure that under all conditions, the President can communicate with the American people.
[01:16:41.332 --> 01:16:46.236]  And it's just amazing, they're using all the up-to-date technology for a top-down approach.
[01:16:46.256 --> 01:16:48.899]  They're going to enter your Xbox and your other video games.
[01:16:49.339 --> 01:16:50.520]  They're going to enter your smart phones.
[01:16:50.540 --> 01:16:51.341]  This is all announced!
[01:16:51.861 --> 01:16:59.672]  And again, Microsoft admitted again a decade ago that all of their computers are hardwired in with these government switches.
[01:17:00.273 --> 01:17:07.143]  And so under the Telecommunications Act, folks, when you see that little FCC approval sticker on a radio or on a computer or anything,
[01:17:07.663 --> 01:17:10.246]  By law, they make you pay for it when you purchase it.
[01:17:11.147 --> 01:17:12.468]  They make you pay for the cost.
[01:17:12.749 --> 01:17:20.297]  They have government takeover switches in them so they can also spy on you, just like the TiVo and other systems are tracking what you're watching.
[01:17:20.537 --> 01:17:22.379]  This is what cybersecurity is.
[01:17:22.399 --> 01:17:23.501]  They admit the Cybersecurity Act.
[01:17:23.861 --> 01:17:26.404]  Everything is hardwired, not just your AM and FM stations.
[01:17:27.709 --> 01:17:43.514]  But if I don't misunderstand the way things were with this alert system, even though they had a local, regional FEMA director who could punch that button at all these radio stations, they couldn't do that nationwide all in one push before, but under this system, they totally can, right?
[01:17:43.534 --> 01:17:45.715]  Well, to be technical, since 96, they can.
[01:17:45.855 --> 01:17:51.237]  They claim that it was the designate for the local FEMA director, but these boxes are shortwave controlled.
[01:17:51.977 --> 01:17:57.163]  Okay, now they're trying to force them to put satellite dishes and things in so they have higher quality, you know, media, government media.
[01:17:57.403 --> 01:18:02.949]  But it's a shortwave system, breaks in, and then a shortwave feed goes out over the system.
[01:18:03.330 --> 01:18:04.171]  That's one of the systems.
[01:18:05.202 --> 01:18:09.563]  But the overall point is that it's centralizing into very few hands of power.
[01:18:09.603 --> 01:18:13.023]  And they'll also have a local designated FEMA, AM, and FM.
[01:18:13.364 --> 01:18:16.024]  So the shortwave's the backup, but it breaks in with that.
[01:18:16.044 --> 01:18:19.885]  But we can have engineers school us on the finer details of this.
[01:18:19.945 --> 01:18:21.045]  But I mean, here we are.
[01:18:21.305 --> 01:18:23.425]  Can you think of a more 1984 system?
[01:18:24.126 --> 01:18:31.227]  And that's what these telescreens are at the 9,000 shopping malls and Walmarts, is the rollout to get us used to government there,
[01:18:31.747 --> 01:18:35.370]  Hanging over us at the checkout line that, oh, we get government messages now.
[01:18:35.390 --> 01:18:36.091]  This is normal.
[01:18:36.791 --> 01:18:39.974]  And it was Walmart who got the Universal Product Code adopted with the Pentagon.
[01:18:40.214 --> 01:18:42.656]  It's Walmart trying to force RFID-3 right now.
[01:18:43.677 --> 01:18:47.380]  But the thing is, all this stuff fell apart at the seams under Bush.
[01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:53.885]  I mean, that five or four color alert chart that went from orange to red was a total joke.
[01:18:53.905 --> 01:18:58.329]  Well, now they're just—and Ridge admits that that was done to scare people.
[01:18:58.789 --> 01:19:01.071]  But see, now they're just going to basically keep us at orange all the time.
[01:19:01.755 --> 01:19:02.616]  That's why they got rid of it.
[01:19:03.818 --> 01:19:07.964]  What are people going to say when it's in their shopping malls and their sports stadiums?
[01:19:08.224 --> 01:19:09.245]  It's there, it's going in.
[01:19:09.566 --> 01:19:12.911]  It doesn't make sense, but I guess people just want to go to the Super Bowl, so...
[01:19:13.598 --> 01:19:20.280]  Well, Aaron, how long until this is up on the Alex Jones Channel at YouTube so we can post a special 13-minute report at InfoWars and Prison Planet?
[01:19:20.540 --> 01:19:24.541]  It is now live, and it's in the stories too, so... Good job, Aaron.
[01:19:25.062 --> 01:19:26.302]  You need to go home and get some sleep.
[01:19:26.942 --> 01:19:32.884]  Just to be clear, I didn't force Aaron to stay up all night, and I was so upset doing research on this, I stayed up all night as well.
[01:19:33.584 --> 01:19:34.305]  Great job, Aaron.
[01:19:35.105 --> 01:19:35.545]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:19:35.805 --> 01:19:36.505]  Thank you so much.
[01:19:36.565 --> 01:19:39.407]  We're going to come back and go directly to Ben, Sean, Chris, Richard.
[01:19:39.687 --> 01:19:47.772]  These are all radio insiders, TV insiders with the EAS alert systems, IT people who are being forced to put these grids in.
[01:19:48.032 --> 01:19:49.313]  You're all welcome to call in.
[01:19:49.333 --> 01:19:59.259]  This is the total seizure of the entire network and the feds want to put in taxpayer-funded broadband to make sure they've got a signal they can broadcast to take over your wireless devices.
[01:20:00.330 --> 01:20:03.611]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[01:20:04.411 --> 01:20:08.633]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[01:20:08.913 --> 01:20:14.835]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[01:20:15.075 --> 01:20:17.216]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[01:20:17.516 --> 01:20:23.458]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[01:20:23.598 --> 01:20:26.922]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[01:20:27.003 --> 01:20:28.705]  There is no other program of its kind.
[01:20:28.885 --> 01:20:30.928]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[01:20:31.068 --> 01:20:35.734]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.
[01:20:35.934 --> 01:20:36.575]  Guaranteed.

[01:20:41.041 --> 01:20:45.822]  Call Zero Debt in 90 days now, 800-477-9256, and ask for free information from an expert who also completed our program.
[01:20:45.842 --> 01:20:47.003]  800-477-9256 or ZeroDebtGuarantee.com.
[01:20:47.023 --> 01:20:47.723]  800-477-9256 or ZeroDebtGuarantee.com.
[01:20:59.773 --> 01:21:00.934]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:21:00.954 --> 01:21:07.662]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:21:07.942 --> 01:21:10.245]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:21:10.505 --> 01:21:15.691]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:21:15.891 --> 01:21:18.692]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:21:18.852 --> 01:21:20.952]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:21:21.172 --> 01:21:27.133]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:21:27.453 --> 01:21:30.674]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:21:30.854 --> 01:21:36.395]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:21:36.655 --> 01:21:37.995]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:21:38.315 --> 01:21:39.535]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:21:39.615 --> 01:21:42.176]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:21:42.296 --> 01:21:43.736]  He explains everything you need to know.
[01:21:43.996 --> 01:21:46.379]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:21:46.539 --> 01:21:50.984]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:21:51.104 --> 01:21:53.566]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[01:21:53.707 --> 01:21:57.410]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.

[01:22:00.051 --> 01:22:00.892]  Gold isn't for you?
[01:22:01.072 --> 01:22:06.415]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[01:22:06.615 --> 01:22:07.016]  I get it.
[01:22:07.136 --> 01:22:16.482]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[01:22:16.762 --> 01:22:17.963]  That's not what's happening.
[01:22:18.183 --> 01:22:26.429]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[01:22:26.649 --> 01:22:29.911]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[01:22:30.031 --> 01:22:34.113]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[01:22:34.293 --> 01:22:35.874]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[01:22:35.894 --> 01:22:39.136]  dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[01:22:39.856 --> 01:22:43.478]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[01:22:43.678 --> 01:22:44.399]  You should, too.
[01:22:44.579 --> 01:22:45.559]  Find out what they know.
[01:22:45.739 --> 01:22:49.021]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[01:22:49.041 --> 01:22:49.081]  800-686-2237.
[01:22:49.101 --> 01:22:49.381]  800-686-2237.
[01:22:49.441 --> 01:22:49.621]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:22:59.224 --> 01:23:08.549]  Nine years, thousands of clients worldwide, amazing results, and here's more proof of the effectiveness of how Heart and Body Extract supports good circulation and healthy arterial flow.
[01:23:08.749 --> 01:23:09.689]  My name is Crystal.
[01:23:10.049 --> 01:23:12.651]  I'm a 45-year-old and live in Houston, Texas.
[01:23:12.991 --> 01:23:16.613]  I was diagnosed with having mitral valve prolapse 10 years ago.
[01:23:16.953 --> 01:23:20.915]  My cardiologist said surgery and drugs was the only thing he could offer me.
[01:23:21.095 --> 01:23:21.896]  What did Crystal do?
[01:23:21.916 --> 01:23:25.560]  I ordered Heart and Body Extract in August 2006.
[01:23:25.881 --> 01:23:32.168]  When I first took my first 15 drops, I embraced the formula and could even feel the goodness of the formula starting to work.
[01:23:32.288 --> 01:23:35.852]  Clean, clear arteries are happy arteries after using Heart and Body Extract.

[01:24:10.543 --> 01:24:17.729]  Okay, I'm gonna go to your phone calls.
[01:24:17.749 --> 01:24:21.192]  Ben, Sean, Chris, Richard, everybody directly.
[01:24:21.432 --> 01:24:26.896]  Station managers, owners, program directors, TV, radio, specific IT people.
[01:24:28.337 --> 01:24:34.139]  And it's in the news, but it's good to hear from folks how they've put these FEMA control systems in, in all the major ISPs.
[01:24:34.439 --> 01:24:40.020]  Your phones are hardwired under federal regulations from 96, had to be in by 2001.
[01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:43.741]  That's how they can now track you with your cell phone, turn it on remotely and listen to you.
[01:24:44.001 --> 01:24:45.081]  That's only part of it.
[01:24:45.341 --> 01:24:47.402]  I'd tell folks about that 15 years ago, they'd laugh.
[01:24:47.682 --> 01:24:48.722]  And now it's all over the news.
[01:24:49.082 --> 01:24:51.383]  Oh, it's good the government listens to you without warrants.
[01:24:52.043 --> 01:24:56.344]  Not when you're talking on the phone, they dial in and listen with the speakerphone function.
[01:24:56.644 --> 01:24:58.165]  This is all being admitted!
[01:24:59.125 --> 01:25:00.666]  Do you understand the magnitude?
[01:25:00.706 --> 01:25:03.347]  Because computer chips have gotten so cheap.
[01:25:03.448 --> 01:25:04.548]  This is the takeover.
[01:25:05.368 --> 01:25:06.969]  Now we're going to do a Google search term.
[01:25:08.450 --> 01:25:09.651]  We're going to do a Google search term.
[01:25:09.811 --> 01:25:11.792]  Obama launches total takeover of media.
[01:25:12.788 --> 01:25:16.471]  Let's do the search term, Obama launches takeover.
[01:25:16.852 --> 01:25:18.713]  Obama launches takeover.
[01:25:18.733 --> 01:25:22.216]  Put those three words into Google, into Yahoo, over and over again.
[01:25:22.236 --> 01:25:23.257]  Let's set it to number one.
[01:25:23.678 --> 01:25:24.999]  Obama launches takeover.
[01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:29.222]  And let's do another search term, Obama takeover media.
[01:25:29.543 --> 01:25:32.585]  Obama takeover media is the second search with those three words.
[01:25:32.926 --> 01:25:35.328]  Obama takeover media and Obama
[01:25:37.492 --> 01:25:39.673]  Launches takeover is the first term.
[01:25:39.933 --> 01:25:40.814]  All right, enough of me.
[01:25:41.214 --> 01:25:46.196]  We're now going to go to these fine station folks that want to comment on this and give us their take on it.
[01:25:46.757 --> 01:25:48.477]  Ben from Tennessee, what's your view of this?
[01:25:49.298 --> 01:25:49.658]  All right.
[01:25:49.818 --> 01:25:52.219]  Oh, and by the way, hello, Alex.
[01:25:53.300 --> 01:25:55.501]  Thanks for bringing this topic up.
[01:25:55.681 --> 01:25:59.483]  EAS has been a thorn in my side for years.
[01:26:00.063 --> 01:26:03.745]  I'm a semi-retired broadcast engineer, mainly radio.
[01:26:04.572 --> 01:26:06.174]  I used to work in Top Ten Markets.
[01:26:06.234 --> 01:26:08.656]  I retired out here to Boondocks in Tennessee.
[01:26:09.057 --> 01:26:22.690]  And one of my main issues with this, obviously besides the whole takeover issue, is, for example, the radio station that I deal with here in town is a 500-watt day timer.
[01:26:22.810 --> 01:26:25.773]  It's a little religious radio station.
[01:26:25.793 --> 01:26:27.675]  They barely got money to keep the lights on.
[01:26:28.736 --> 01:26:38.018]  Okay, it's run by, and I'm not kidding, it's the only station in town, it's run by an 87-year-old Baptist preacher, okay?
[01:26:38.658 --> 01:26:43.959]  And he gets money, you know, it's the old pay-before-you-pray type of radio, you know?
[01:26:44.019 --> 01:26:52.060]  I mean, he puts radio preachers on the air, spends some gospel music CDs, doesn't really have a staff.
[01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:57.041]  A lot of the things, sadly, runs on automatic pilot a lot of the time.
[01:26:57.621 --> 01:27:12.944]  But, I got involved with his EAS system a good while ago, mainly because the FCC requires the radio stations to have these, otherwise there's a substantial fine if it's not in operation.
[01:27:13.004 --> 01:27:19.106]  And you've got to do weekly tests, and they're watching to make sure you're complying and there are takeover systems in place.
[01:27:19.906 --> 01:27:21.166]  That is absolutely correct.
[01:27:21.226 --> 01:27:25.747]  However, he went through a number of contract engineers
[01:27:26.229 --> 01:27:26.810]  We're good to go.
[01:27:43.964 --> 01:28:05.769]  An inspector from the Federal Communications Commission walked in and saw that it had been basically collecting dust in the rack for several years, and said, hey, I'm going to give you X number of days to get this thing online, or we're going to start fining you thousands of dollars per day
[01:28:06.713 --> 01:28:08.574]  For each day it's not on the air.
[01:28:08.674 --> 01:28:11.195]  And by the way, Communist Russia didn't have this, but we do.
[01:28:11.235 --> 01:28:11.556]  Go ahead.
[01:28:12.056 --> 01:28:12.976]  Right, exactly.
[01:28:13.076 --> 01:28:20.200]  So, what you've got is a radio station that, a full 500 watt daytimeer that, you know, can barely pay its bills.
[01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:22.621]  It can't even, you know, has no employees.
[01:28:24.549 --> 01:28:25.390]  I don't know.
[01:28:44.693 --> 01:28:45.113]  I think?
[01:28:59.744 --> 01:29:00.464]  No, exactly.
[01:29:01.384 --> 01:29:02.965]  Great points, Ben, and we're going to come back with others.
[01:29:02.985 --> 01:29:04.105]  We've got one minute left, though.
[01:29:04.425 --> 01:29:16.949]  What's your view of them hardwiring the cell phones, the computers, and now announcing that not only is the takeover system in place, they're going to start commandeering time randomly and making you listen to Barry Sitaro?
[01:29:17.796 --> 01:29:20.198]  Well, again, you've got the programming issue.
[01:29:20.798 --> 01:29:30.145]  You've got a situation where you've got a conservative radio station and messages they don't want to broadcast.
[01:29:30.165 --> 01:29:33.248]  Airwaves are free, at least it should be.
[01:29:33.268 --> 01:29:34.068]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:29:36.530 --> 01:29:36.910]  Exactly.
[01:29:36.951 --> 01:29:38.092]  This is Fairness Doctrine 2.0.
[01:29:38.432 --> 01:29:41.536]  Oh, you know, we're just going to make you listen to us.
[01:29:41.556 --> 01:29:44.419]  We're going to make you listen to Cass Sunstein, Globalism.
[01:29:44.659 --> 01:29:45.360]  Great points, Ben.
[01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:47.663]  We're going to talk to more station folks on the other side.
[01:29:47.683 --> 01:29:49.064]  What a great radio voice that guy had.
[01:29:50.246 --> 01:29:51.147]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.647 --> 01:29:53.249]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.170 --> 01:29:56.873]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.861 --> 01:30:03.563]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[01:30:03.703 --> 01:30:07.746]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[01:30:07.986 --> 01:30:12.769]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[01:30:12.889 --> 01:30:17.872]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[01:30:18.633 --> 01:30:21.835]  Not worried about them moving south.
[01:30:22.295 --> 01:30:25.797]  Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[01:30:28.551 --> 01:30:35.796]  We're American and be proud.
[01:30:35.897 --> 01:30:38.278]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[01:30:54.375 --> 01:30:58.950]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[01:30:59.619 --> 01:31:03.842]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:31:04.162 --> 01:31:04.762]  Number 1.
[01:31:05.082 --> 01:31:08.224]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:08.505 --> 01:31:09.065]  Number 2.
[01:31:09.365 --> 01:31:13.908]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:31:14.248 --> 01:31:14.709]  It's true.
[01:31:15.009 --> 01:31:19.552]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:19.872 --> 01:31:20.412]  Number 3.
[01:31:20.692 --> 01:31:23.974]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:31:24.275 --> 01:31:27.997]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:28.177 --> 01:31:28.738]  Number 4.
[01:31:28.978 --> 01:31:31.341]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:31:31.741 --> 01:31:35.125]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:31:35.425 --> 01:31:35.966]  Number 5.
[01:31:36.206 --> 01:31:40.130]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:31:40.371 --> 01:31:45.136]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:31:45.416 --> 01:31:49.441]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:49.581 --> 01:31:51.143]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:51.363 --> 01:31:53.425]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:31:53.626 --> 01:31:55.968]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:32:00.319 --> 01:32:14.788]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:32:15.788 --> 01:32:19.471]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:20.478 --> 01:32:32.490]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:32:33.250 --> 01:32:40.517]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:32:41.198 --> 01:32:50.802]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[01:32:51.562 --> 01:32:54.843]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[01:32:55.484 --> 01:32:58.605]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[01:33:03.092 --> 01:33:07.295]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:33:07.856 --> 01:33:11.558]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:12.839 --> 01:33:15.761]  Extremism in defense of liberty is no vice.
[01:33:19.744 --> 01:33:22.186]  Okay, Sean, Chris, Richard, John, Julio.
[01:33:23.287 --> 01:33:27.330]  Everybody calling, I guess, works in radio, engineers, you name it.
[01:33:28.621 --> 01:33:30.242]  I don't want to miss the forest for the trees.
[01:33:30.402 --> 01:33:31.762]  Yes, EAS is wrong.
[01:33:31.802 --> 01:33:33.883]  Yes, it's indentured servitude to the federal government.
[01:33:34.203 --> 01:33:44.288]  Yes, stations spend incredible amounts of money, even big ones, fiddling and yelling, and yes, it's not right, but they do it, cussing the EAS system.
[01:33:45.668 --> 01:33:47.829]  But that's not for me even the issue.
[01:33:48.650 --> 01:33:51.611]  Okay, sure, it's free market, it's an issue of liberty on that front.
[01:33:52.879 --> 01:34:00.520]  They are announcing that they're going to force you now to listen to presidential and FEMA and Homeland Security fear-mongering reports.
[01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:04.461]  That is out of a science fiction movie of tyranny.
[01:34:05.661 --> 01:34:15.463]  In every dystopic novel written about a future tyranny, the government has telescreens everywhere telling you to fear your neighbors and telling you to spy on people.
[01:34:16.023 --> 01:34:19.324]  I mean, it's like they're using 1984 as a handbook.
[01:34:19.484 --> 01:34:20.644]  And here's the issue.
[01:34:21.184 --> 01:34:22.145]  And I'm going to your calls.
[01:34:22.265 --> 01:34:41.156]  When Obama was super hot, when Obama was the savior, and had an 80 plus percent national approval rating, during the end of the campaign in the first month when he got elected, when people thought they were going to get free houses, free cars, that he was like a leprechaun, that was just going to give them everything they wanted, you know, the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow,
[01:34:43.103 --> 01:34:47.685]  His videos on YouTube would get 300,000, a million, two million views.
[01:34:48.125 --> 01:34:52.926]  When you go to whitehouse.gov, videos that are three months old have like 2,000, 3,000 views.
[01:34:53.306 --> 01:34:54.747]  His new videos have a couple hundred.
[01:34:55.447 --> 01:34:57.048]  They can't shovel this stuff.
[01:34:57.068 --> 01:35:03.970]  You go to Homeland Security website, unless we link to one of their videos to point out the police state, it gets like 300 views in a month.
[01:35:04.410 --> 01:35:05.911]  No one wants to listen to them.
[01:35:06.271 --> 01:35:10.112]  No one wants to, not even the mind-numbed, you know, mainline liberals.
[01:35:11.370 --> 01:35:21.381]  And for all you liberals out there that are loving this takeover of the media and Cass Sunstein calling to arrest people that criticize man-made global warming and all of this, and those are all on record.
[01:35:22.903 --> 01:35:27.368]  And the FCC diversities are saying we should be like Hugo Chavez and shut down conservative media.
[01:35:28.700 --> 01:35:30.722]  What do you think is going to happen when a Republican gets in?
[01:35:31.102 --> 01:35:36.386]  This is done by the military-industrial complex, the big banks that have taken our country over.
[01:35:36.766 --> 01:35:42.450]  This is a system that they put in under Clinton that's continued right through with Bush and now Obama.
[01:35:42.871 --> 01:35:50.757]  And they cite executive orders under nuclear war from the 60s as their pretext in these government documents to do it.
[01:35:51.317 --> 01:35:54.062]  But the issue is, this was all going on under the surface.
[01:35:54.322 --> 01:35:59.531]  So if you weren't in media, and you didn't know engineers, and station managers and owners, you didn't know about it.
[01:36:00.533 --> 01:36:02.255]  I put it in my 99 film, Police State 2000.
[01:36:03.900 --> 01:36:07.204]  Now they're announcing they're going to start forcing you to hear these announcements.
[01:36:07.544 --> 01:36:13.951]  And who grandstands at the Super Bowl, at press conference, like she's a celebrity up there with movie stars.
[01:36:14.351 --> 01:36:17.315]  Janet Napolitano saying spy on each other.
[01:36:17.575 --> 01:36:25.764]  They're forcing their way into our lives like our new pastime is worshipping government and spying on each other because no one wants to listen to them.
[01:36:26.084 --> 01:36:27.385]  No one buys what they're saying.
[01:36:27.405 --> 01:36:30.907]  It isn't enough the billions spent for propaganda placement in TV.
[01:36:31.207 --> 01:36:33.429]  Not just ads, but messages in the shows.
[01:36:33.849 --> 01:36:35.930]  It's not enough all the reporters they've bought off.
[01:36:35.950 --> 01:36:37.712]  Remember Armstrong Williams?
[01:36:37.972 --> 01:36:38.992]  That's the tip of the iceberg.
[01:36:39.313 --> 01:36:42.655]  Getting a quarter million bucks to go around and push stuff for the White House secretly.
[01:36:43.973 --> 01:36:46.594]  This is full-spectrum takeover of the media.
[01:36:46.634 --> 01:36:48.394]  They're announcing your online video games.
[01:36:48.434 --> 01:36:49.855]  Government messages will be forced on.
[01:36:50.335 --> 01:36:51.155]  Your cell phones.
[01:36:51.395 --> 01:36:51.815]  Everything.
[01:36:51.875 --> 01:36:52.676]  Okay, enough of me.
[01:36:52.956 --> 01:36:53.956]  I just wanted to lay that out.
[01:36:54.376 --> 01:36:58.017]  This is about them making... See, you choose to tune into this show.
[01:36:58.697 --> 01:37:00.398]  You choose to tune into that local station.
[01:37:01.226 --> 01:37:02.946]  Because you like what it has to say.
[01:37:02.986 --> 01:37:03.927]  You get value from it.
[01:37:04.207 --> 01:37:12.889]  They're forcing you to hear from them, and they're putting these systems in with taxpayer money and using coercion to make everybody go along with this.
[01:37:12.929 --> 01:37:13.789]  And that's not enough for them.
[01:37:14.049 --> 01:37:22.171]  Now at the Walmart checkout line, now at the shopping mall checkout line, now at the county square, now everywhere, you're going to be subjected to this.
[01:37:22.452 --> 01:37:23.732]  I'm going to be subjected to this.
[01:37:24.392 --> 01:37:25.553]  Orwellian nightmare.
[01:37:25.593 --> 01:37:29.036]  Let's talk to Sean in Ohio, then Chris, Richard, John, Julio, and others.
[01:37:29.096 --> 01:37:30.677]  I gotta move quick because I know you guys are busy.
[01:37:31.257 --> 01:37:33.119]  Sean, in Ohio, you're on the air.
[01:37:33.139 --> 01:37:34.680]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:37:34.700 --> 01:37:36.441]  Oh, I'm just didn't get any sleep.
[01:37:36.481 --> 01:37:39.063]  I'm so freaked out about this because we know the system's there.
[01:37:39.303 --> 01:37:42.926]  The fact that they would start rolling it out, I mean, this is red alert crazy.
[01:37:43.646 --> 01:37:45.888]  Yeah, I heard you saying you were up all night about it.
[01:37:45.908 --> 01:37:47.469]  Yeah, I'm not surprised at all to hear that.
[01:37:48.621 --> 01:37:50.707]  They're going to start using it for these kind of things.
[01:37:51.429 --> 01:37:53.796]  Working up here, I'm up in Northeast Ohio.
[01:37:53.996 --> 01:37:55.220]  We get a lot of bad weather up here.
[01:37:56.894 --> 01:38:10.020]  When there's like a real bad storm coming through, you know, they'll break through with the EAS, they'll break through whatever programming's on and, you know, they'll announce... As if your station doesn't have even better feeds and partnerships with the local TV news weather people.
[01:38:10.260 --> 01:38:16.723]  As if you need their report, you know, I mean, like two days after a flood, they're still popping in saying a flood's coming.
[01:38:16.944 --> 01:38:23.447]  And again, they use reasonable things like floods or kidnap kids to set the precedent, as I said, over a decade ago.
[01:38:23.807 --> 01:38:25.368]  Now it's spy on your neighbor.
[01:38:25.408 --> 01:38:25.908]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:38:26.548 --> 01:38:26.948]  No, it's cool.
[01:38:27.208 --> 01:38:29.169]  Yeah, that's exactly it.
[01:38:29.189 --> 01:38:30.809]  That's really the only good thing that it was for.
[01:38:30.829 --> 01:38:38.451]  But now, like I said, I'm not surprised at all to hear them announce that they're going to start using it to, you know, put out these messages to everybody.
[01:38:38.491 --> 01:38:50.133]  Because, yeah, like the caller before me said, if we're supposed to log, you know, once a week, at least once a week, you know, one scheduled test, and then they monthly, they'll run a test on their own.
[01:38:50.213 --> 01:38:52.334]  That'll just break in to the DJs talking, you know.
[01:38:53.498 --> 01:39:01.141]  But yeah, if we don't schedule those EASs at least once a week, we'll get fined a thousand dollars or a couple thousand dollars.
[01:39:01.561 --> 01:39:02.782]  We're a small station, too.
[01:39:03.522 --> 01:39:06.443]  We only cover a 60-70 mile radius, I'd say.
[01:39:06.503 --> 01:39:13.926]  But Sean, what do you think of the fact that they have got the nerve now to say they're going to be breaking in on our cell phones with audio and text messages?
[01:39:13.966 --> 01:39:15.206]  Imagine, just Obama.
[01:39:15.566 --> 01:39:20.608]  You're sitting there having dinner and Obama starts telling you about terrorists and you better give all your rights up to him.
[01:39:22.123 --> 01:39:22.844]  Yeah, I know.
[01:39:22.904 --> 01:39:24.546]  That's the last thing I want.
[01:39:25.066 --> 01:39:27.368]  Going through a big company like Verizon.
[01:39:27.569 --> 01:39:30.411]  As if I don't get enough bad shit from them already.
[01:39:31.212 --> 01:39:32.593]  Alright, I appreciate your call.
[01:39:35.897 --> 01:39:41.162]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Chris in North Carolina.
[01:39:41.222 --> 01:39:42.083]  Chris, you're on the air.
[01:39:42.123 --> 01:39:42.663]  Go ahead.
[01:39:43.044 --> 01:39:44.085]  What do you do in media?
[01:39:45.429 --> 01:39:46.770]  I'm a program director, Alex.
[01:39:46.850 --> 01:39:48.170]  It's a pleasure to talk with you.
[01:39:48.190 --> 01:39:52.031]  I'm a fairly new listener to your program, so I want to thank you for doing what you're doing.
[01:39:52.311 --> 01:39:53.832]  I've got a couple questions for you.
[01:39:54.712 --> 01:39:55.152]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:39:55.832 --> 01:39:57.533]  Is your program required to air this?
[01:39:57.593 --> 01:39:58.453]  Are you going to run it?
[01:39:59.033 --> 01:39:59.894]  Absolutely not!
[01:40:00.214 --> 01:40:01.054]  Absolutely not!
[01:40:01.074 --> 01:40:02.695]  And you know why?
[01:40:03.055 --> 01:40:07.736]  I don't have a broadcast tower on top of the facility that I'm in.
[01:40:07.756 --> 01:40:12.398]  I send it up to a satellite and then FCC regulated systems pick it up.
[01:40:12.458 --> 01:40:12.998]  But yes,
[01:40:13.678 --> 01:40:28.329]  Yes, under the architecture they've put in, all broadband, all cell phones, all internet websites, and they already have this technology, will have break-ins and messages or they'll just turn the internet off.
[01:40:28.909 --> 01:40:31.512]  No, I'm not going to do anything, the FCC says.
[01:40:31.892 --> 01:40:33.233]  They don't have jurisdiction over me.
[01:40:34.134 --> 01:40:41.001]  But we follow the FCC rules because we already don't have a potty mouth program.
[01:40:41.301 --> 01:40:44.724]  Again, they set the precedent with, oh, you can't have cuss words because it sounds reasonable.
[01:40:45.004 --> 01:40:47.887]  Then it's, oh, you can't bash people politically.
[01:40:48.187 --> 01:40:48.368]  See?
[01:40:48.388 --> 01:40:49.649]  And then they set that precedent.
[01:40:51.178 --> 01:40:52.841]  Now, read an article on Radio World.
[01:40:52.881 --> 01:40:57.908]  It's saying here that all EAS participants have until September 30th of this year to implement CAP.
[01:40:59.911 --> 01:41:03.036]  Am I reading that properly, that this isn't going to happen before September 30th?
[01:41:04.605 --> 01:41:09.671]  Well, there are literally scores of federal agencies all arguing with each other.
[01:41:09.731 --> 01:41:24.106]  What we know is under the 96 Telecommunications Act that I've been screaming bloody murder over ever since, it said every cell phone, every computer device that receives either plugged into the internet or wireless
[01:41:25.347 --> 01:41:34.137]  We'll have default codes that when they receive this government code that the computer or cell phone device will be taken over.
[01:41:34.538 --> 01:41:35.419]  It said in the specs.
[01:41:35.439 --> 01:41:36.360]  That's how we knew it then.
[01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:37.261]  People couldn't believe it.
[01:41:37.541 --> 01:41:42.507]  Now, of course, there's newscasts all the time going, hey, the government's listening to you on your phone, even when it's off.
[01:41:42.947 --> 01:41:45.148]  Hey, the government's using your OnStar to listen to you.
[01:41:45.508 --> 01:41:47.228]  They can break in and use that microphone.
[01:41:47.628 --> 01:41:50.549]  Hey, there's going to be government announcements on your cell phone.
[01:41:51.409 --> 01:42:04.232]  The FCC is trying to push all the manufacturers of clock radios, radio clock radios, to where there's a little chip in there where it automatically turns on for, quote, weather alerts, because, oh, a tornado's coming your way.
[01:42:05.112 --> 01:42:08.333]  So they have the EAS in place.
[01:42:09.468 --> 01:42:15.621]  I mean, you can go to InfoWars.com and read our article, Obama launches total takeover of media.
[01:42:16.485 --> 01:42:20.628]  And then it links to Federal Radio.
[01:42:21.548 --> 01:42:26.612]  And Federal Radio, of course, is a group of stations in the D.C.
[01:42:26.732 --> 01:42:27.072]  area.
[01:42:27.592 --> 01:42:30.174]  FCC Presidential Emergency Alerts to be Tested.
[01:42:30.614 --> 01:42:41.662]  And they have the FCC FEMA spokesperson in a little five-minute or so audio clip, and we're linked to this up on InfoWars.com, where they talk about how, yes, in the next few months,
[01:42:42.122 --> 01:42:46.544]  They are integrating now a top-down system where it's all centrally controlled.
[01:42:47.044 --> 01:42:50.705]  They can always break in with that, but it was before regionally run by FEMA.
[01:42:51.065 --> 01:43:06.851]  Now it's all going to be run out of the White House, FEMA, Homeland Security, and they announced there that they're going to now begin breaking in with actual presidential announcements, not just the test announcement, but someday you might hear an announcement during an emergency.
[01:43:07.732 --> 01:43:08.152]  Is that clear?
[01:43:09.472 --> 01:43:09.872]  Very clear.
[01:43:09.912 --> 01:43:11.654]  The EAS has always kind of been a hassle to me.
[01:43:11.994 --> 01:43:14.757]  However, it's absolutely insane what's going on here.
[01:43:14.817 --> 01:43:16.939]  But the question is, how do you fight it?
[01:43:17.019 --> 01:43:17.660]  Can we fight it?
[01:43:17.700 --> 01:43:18.241]  What do you do?
[01:43:18.641 --> 01:43:20.523]  The information is great, but what's next?
[01:43:20.663 --> 01:43:21.304]  How do we fight it?
[01:43:22.299 --> 01:43:23.839]  Man, let's put our heads together.
[01:43:24.099 --> 01:43:27.620]  We need to lobby Congress, station owners, managers.
[01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:38.522]  We have a right, broadcasters, listeners, have a right to our free speech to say we don't like the fact that the FCC has been wanting the Fairness Doctrine.
[01:43:38.722 --> 01:43:41.143]  That the FCC is saying they have jurisdiction over the Internet.
[01:43:41.303 --> 01:43:44.023]  They've already put the controls in, now they just want the legalese done.
[01:43:46.844 --> 01:44:01.831]  We don't want them politicizing this system that's already unconstitutional and and basically using it for political partisan gain and both political parties and independents shouldn't be for it and you need to when you go to your
[01:44:02.711 --> 01:44:14.717]  North Carolina Association of Broadcasters, or your Texas Association of Broadcasters that have a lot of power, you guys need to say, look, let's talk about... I mean, every station person I've ever talked to is completely angry about this.
[01:44:15.378 --> 01:44:21.681]  And they did prowl balloons two other times telling them, get ready for the government to routinely break in with longer announcements.
[01:44:22.581 --> 01:44:32.788]  Uh, and they're also talking about, uh, in the Senate, Jay Rockefeller's talking about government-controlled cable TV that basically mandates what can be said and done there.
[01:44:32.848 --> 01:44:38.972]  I mean, he said we'd be better off without ever having the Internet, that he'd like to, quote, shut down Fox News and MSNBC.
[01:44:39.792 --> 01:44:41.914]  Uh, so, uh, we get the word out.
[01:44:41.934 --> 01:44:42.314]  I mean, look.
[01:44:44.628 --> 01:44:45.809]  You guys have the media.
[01:44:46.871 --> 01:44:49.033]  And if you don't use it to save it, we're gonna lose it.
[01:44:49.474 --> 01:45:01.328]  I mean, use the First Amendment as they're trying to shut it down, because the First Amendment's meant to defeat the First Amendment when they try to get rid of free speech, as every corrupt, decadent empire always tries to do.
[01:45:03.510 --> 01:45:03.831]  You're right.
[01:45:04.761 --> 01:45:13.285]  Well, I really appreciate all that you do, and I'm going to research this more, continue listening to you guys, but you know, you're great what you do, Alex, and I really appreciate it.
[01:45:13.585 --> 01:45:17.087]  Chris, you're great, and I appreciate your call, but I mean, I'm not... I'm just doing my duty here.
[01:45:17.107 --> 01:45:19.088]  People are always like, you're doing such a great job, Alex.
[01:45:20.849 --> 01:45:21.029]  Look...
[01:45:22.117 --> 01:45:32.380]  Obviously, if the government says, oh, we want you to have a local station wired into FEMA in case there's a nuclear attack, we're going to break in with these alerts.
[01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:36.902]  I mean, that's been going on before FEMA existed under COG, continuity of government.
[01:45:36.922 --> 01:45:37.602]  It's been going on since the 50s.
[01:45:39.534 --> 01:45:46.258]  But then the stations tuned to the station, and they tuned in and saw some dictator saying, I am your leader, turn in your guns.
[01:45:46.658 --> 01:45:51.641]  You better believe that the other stations would get on and say, don't listen to it, it's tyranny.
[01:45:52.001 --> 01:45:56.644]  They don't want to trust you with the power of your own free speech and your own station.
[01:45:57.024 --> 01:46:03.688]  That's why they make you wire in the final chain at the broadcast tower, everything through it.
[01:46:05.091 --> 01:46:06.412]  So, it's there.
[01:46:07.092 --> 01:46:12.235]  And, you know, I've got this clip, but I'm going to play it later when Tyrell Ventura's on with it, because I want to get to the rest of your calls.
[01:46:12.275 --> 01:46:22.962]  But I have the sheriff from out in Louisiana, there in New Orleans, talking about FEMA cutting the police radio tower.
[01:46:23.502 --> 01:46:26.244]  And the police came and said, the sheriffs, why'd you do this?
[01:46:26.284 --> 01:46:27.205]  We need these radios.
[01:46:27.465 --> 01:46:33.189]  Everybody said, oh, the police in New Orleans and the county police, they just stood down and walked off the job.
[01:46:33.669 --> 01:46:38.153]  No, it turned out FEMA, as the storm hit, ran cell phone jammers.
[01:46:38.313 --> 01:46:38.993]  That's on record.
[01:46:39.554 --> 01:46:40.474]  That's mainstream news.
[01:46:40.494 --> 01:46:41.075]  You can pull it up.
[01:46:41.115 --> 01:46:43.437]  FEMA ran cell phone jammers during Katrina.
[01:46:44.057 --> 01:46:44.617]  As it hit.
[01:46:44.958 --> 01:46:47.580]  Then they went in with axes and
[01:46:48.340 --> 01:46:53.501]  Hacked up the police, uh, sheriff and police department towers.
[01:46:53.581 --> 01:46:56.702]  They don't want your local government being in place.
[01:46:57.122 --> 01:46:59.883]  What do you think the John Warner Defense Authorization Act says?
[01:47:00.383 --> 01:47:13.867]  It says the federal government's preparing for sedition in the states and by governors, and Obama has created a 10-member governor's council so he can claim the governors are showing control, but those 10 appointed governors have the power over the 10 FEMA regents.
[01:47:14.967 --> 01:47:18.148]  It's all covered in Police State 4 The Rise of FEMA that came out last year.
[01:47:18.188 --> 01:47:19.029]  We covered this again.
[01:47:19.249 --> 01:47:20.169]  The whole spectrum.
[01:47:20.349 --> 01:47:22.050]  You've got to get all the pieces to see it.
[01:47:22.810 --> 01:47:24.471]  Oh man, this is really freaking me out.
[01:47:24.811 --> 01:47:28.232]  Because they're announcing now that they're going to start having these announcements.
[01:47:28.272 --> 01:47:30.113]  Now, if we don't go along with it, they'll back off.
[01:47:30.513 --> 01:47:31.973]  But we've got to keep fighting.
[01:47:32.814 --> 01:47:34.374]  Richard in California, thanks for holding.
[01:47:34.394 --> 01:47:35.175]  Are you an engineer?
[01:47:35.495 --> 01:47:36.375]  Talk show host?
[01:47:37.215 --> 01:47:38.056]  What do you do in radio?
[01:47:38.496 --> 01:47:39.796]  Yeah, I'm an engineer.
[01:47:39.816 --> 01:47:41.737]  I work at a TV station right here in LA.
[01:47:42.890 --> 01:47:45.310]  And I've been there since the old days of the EBS.
[01:47:46.671 --> 01:48:00.273]  When, um, it was an AM receiver tuned to a local station here, and it was voluntary that we shut our transmitter off, and, you know, let people tune to, um, to the local AM station to get all the information.
[01:48:01.013 --> 01:48:04.454]  But since 96, this EAS thing has become mandatory.
[01:48:05.594 --> 01:48:10.295]  And here recently, within the last, um, I'd say the last six months or so,
[01:48:11.212 --> 01:48:13.273]  We've had to keep a log of all those printouts.
[01:48:13.574 --> 01:48:15.435]  And that thing prints out constantly.
[01:48:41.485 --> 01:48:44.406]  Complete log of it.
[01:48:44.526 --> 01:48:48.487]  And the tape that comes out in a 24-hour period is maybe 10 feet long.
[01:48:49.987 --> 01:48:51.268]  And like I say, it's a constant.
[01:48:51.348 --> 01:48:52.928]  Every hour, something is printing out.
[01:48:53.088 --> 01:48:57.810]  Now I know, working in radio stations, that federal box just sits there, everything wired through it.
[01:48:58.330 --> 01:49:03.531]  So you, you know, the last piece in the chain, and it's just spitting out orders.
[01:49:03.851 --> 01:49:04.592]  I mean, it's incredible.
[01:49:05.212 --> 01:49:08.873]  And one other thing I'll let you know, too, is the V-chip that they put in the TVs?
[01:49:09.153 --> 01:49:09.333]  Yes.
[01:49:09.984 --> 01:49:12.103]  They are able to break into your TV with that.
[01:49:12.717 --> 01:49:13.177]  Oh, I know.
[01:49:13.257 --> 01:49:15.119]  That's the 1996 Telecommunications Act.
[01:49:15.679 --> 01:49:21.303]  Every cell phone, every TV, in 96, they said, here's the mandate.
[01:49:22.003 --> 01:49:24.745]  All manufacturers by 2001, it has to be in place.
[01:49:25.105 --> 01:49:27.267]  A lot of cell phones, a lot of TVs had it immediately.
[01:49:27.587 --> 01:49:29.248]  Now, everything's got it.
[01:49:29.768 --> 01:49:31.830]  And that's why they want you on digital TV.
[01:49:32.230 --> 01:49:37.694]  Because if you were still picking up old-fashioned broadcast, that meant you had an old, you know, tube television you liked.
[01:49:38.114 --> 01:49:41.396]  My mom's still got one that, you know, that we have when I was a kid in the kitchen.
[01:49:41.736 --> 01:49:42.437]  She just loves it.
[01:49:43.177 --> 01:49:47.020]  And it still works, but it won't work now because of the digital feed.
[01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:49.962]  But I mean, do you see the dastardliness of this?
[01:49:51.563 --> 01:49:56.047]  I see it, but it's like the people around me, they're going, oh, it's no big deal.
[01:49:57.027 --> 01:49:58.048]  I'll give you one example.
[01:49:58.168 --> 01:50:02.511]  On Saturday, my daughter's laptop was sitting on the kitchen table, right?
[01:50:03.492 --> 01:50:05.013]  And the thing turned itself on.
[01:50:06.194 --> 01:50:10.557]  Her webcam came on and the thing logged onto some website.
[01:50:11.537 --> 01:50:13.119]  And I'm thinking, what's going on here?
[01:50:13.199 --> 01:50:14.641]  Maybe she left the computer on.
[01:50:14.902 --> 01:50:17.665]  But we found out the thing was logging itself on.
[01:50:17.685 --> 01:50:20.109]  Hold on, I'm going to hold you over.
[01:50:20.209 --> 01:50:21.951]  And we're getting Tyrell on right after.
[01:50:21.971 --> 01:50:24.995]  Then I'm going to go to John Julio and Don at least.
[01:50:25.035 --> 01:50:26.577]  But exactly.
[01:50:26.858 --> 01:50:28.079]  Remember Pennsylvania?
[01:50:28.925 --> 01:50:37.989]  Where the school told on itself, because they were ready to announce it, they said, yeah, we've taken 30 plus thousand images and videos of your kids at home over the laptops.
[01:50:38.569 --> 01:50:39.990]  We're watching them take showers.
[01:50:40.010 --> 01:50:42.751]  We're watching them take drugs.
[01:50:42.771 --> 01:50:44.492]  It turned out it was Skittles the kid was eating.
[01:50:45.052 --> 01:50:46.173]  And they just announced it.
[01:50:47.233 --> 01:50:49.877]  With government-issued laptops, people are like, well, it's a free laptop.
[01:50:49.917 --> 01:50:51.198]  No, you paid for it with tax money.
[01:50:51.519 --> 01:50:51.939]  Stay there.
[01:50:52.099 --> 01:50:52.660]  Absolutely.
[01:50:52.961 --> 01:50:56.205]  Look, Homeland Security is taking over, folks.
[01:50:56.846 --> 01:50:58.308]  It's what's so frustrating about it.
[01:50:58.328 --> 01:50:59.229]  It's really happening.
[01:51:00.070 --> 01:51:02.193]  What bothers you most about menopause?
[01:51:02.353 --> 01:51:03.314]  Is it the hot flashes?
[01:51:03.694 --> 01:51:05.557]  Waking up at night drenched in sweat?
[01:51:05.717 --> 01:51:07.919]  How about the mood swings or putting on weight?
[01:51:08.139 --> 01:51:13.385]  Tens of thousands of women have turned to Amberin to get relief from their menopause symptoms.
[01:51:13.765 --> 01:51:15.287]  Will Amberin work for you too?
[01:51:15.547 --> 01:51:17.729]  The only way to find out is to give it a try.
[01:51:17.969 --> 01:51:23.415]  That's why we're giving every woman who calls today a complimentary risk-free trial of Amberin.
[01:51:23.635 --> 01:51:25.536]  With a 30-day supply, free!
[01:51:25.977 --> 01:51:30.780]  Ambrin is all natural and its safety and effectiveness is backed by published clinical studies.
[01:51:31.040 --> 01:51:34.643]  Do you want a life without hot flashes, night sweats or mood swings?
[01:51:34.903 --> 01:51:37.545]  Want to lose weight, sleep great and have more energy?
[01:51:37.785 --> 01:51:40.267]  We've made trying Ambrin completely risk-free.
[01:51:40.367 --> 01:51:40.647]  I think so.
[01:51:59.761 --> 01:52:01.022]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:01.062 --> 01:52:06.405]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:06.665 --> 01:52:11.288]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:11.688 --> 01:52:12.088]  It's true.
[01:52:12.168 --> 01:52:14.730]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[01:52:14.970 --> 01:52:16.711]  And it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:52:17.251 --> 01:52:21.954]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:22.475 --> 01:52:24.396]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:52:24.796 --> 01:52:29.399]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:52:29.599 --> 01:52:30.500]  And here's the best part.
[01:52:30.720 --> 01:52:33.482]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:52:33.782 --> 01:52:37.064]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:52:37.384 --> 01:52:40.225]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:40.566 --> 01:52:42.467]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:42.787 --> 01:52:43.567]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:52:43.587 --> 01:52:43.847]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:52:43.887 --> 01:52:46.889]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:47.389 --> 01:52:49.110]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:59.958 --> 01:53:02.981]  Strength, energy, and endurance are all synonymous with youth.
[01:53:03.341 --> 01:53:04.643]  Would you like to feel youthful again?
[01:53:05.123 --> 01:53:09.047]  Protein absorption and synthesis are at the foundation of strength, energy, and endurance.
[01:53:09.387 --> 01:53:16.935]  Insults to your intestinal lining from drugs, heavy metals, bad diet, and age can inhibit your absorption of amino acids from your protein foods.
[01:53:17.475 --> 01:53:20.358]  This causes your body to repair slowly and be prone to injury.
[01:53:20.758 --> 01:53:26.144]  By taking a highly digestible protein into your body, you can greatly increase your repair rate and energy level.
[01:53:26.705 --> 01:53:30.088]  One World Whey Protein Powder is more digestible than milk or eggs.
[01:53:30.609 --> 01:53:35.974]  One World Whey is the first ever truly unheated whey protein powder from grass-fed cows on the market.
[01:53:36.475 --> 01:53:41.060]  Whether you like to exercise, want more energy, want greater strength, or just want to feel better,
[01:53:41.380 --> 01:53:43.161]  One World Way is a must for you to try.

[01:53:52.148 --> 01:53:52.928]  Or call 888-988-3325.
[01:53:52.948 --> 01:53:53.148]  That's 888-988-3325.
[01:53:53.168 --> 01:53:53.889]  Woah, boom, bop-a-boom.
[01:54:11.333 --> 01:54:24.042]  We're going to put on screen for you, for Pennsylvania, where the school district settled for taking thousands, it was over 30,000 photos and videos of children.
[01:54:24.162 --> 01:54:26.183]  They settled for $610,000.
[01:54:26.343 --> 01:54:31.107]  Now, how did we discover this last year?
[01:54:31.667 --> 01:54:35.370]  The school came out and called parents and said, we've been watching your children.
[01:54:36.532 --> 01:54:37.353]  And they said, what?
[01:54:38.194 --> 01:54:46.881]  They said, yeah, we can turn the video camera on and we can video them or take still shots of it.
[01:54:48.402 --> 01:54:58.871]  I remember about seven years ago in Tennessee, it was headline in the news, panic caused when girls basketball team finds camera in shower.
[01:54:59.890 --> 01:55:02.112]  And the parents were still normal and not brainwashed.
[01:55:02.132 --> 01:55:02.772]  They went, what's going on?
[01:55:02.792 --> 01:55:03.693]  It was a visiting team.
[01:55:03.973 --> 01:55:08.216]  But the local school was brainwashed because they'd announced it and told everybody, you know, that was in there.
[01:55:08.236 --> 01:55:10.237]  They said, well, we have fights sometimes in the showers.
[01:55:11.157 --> 01:55:14.580]  Same thing happened in the capital of California.
[01:55:15.912 --> 01:55:39.094]  uh... sacramento the police were accessing the bathroom cams folks this is so and and i've had people come to me on the street and say schools aren't watching kids over their laptops you're a liar they won't even search it we'll put the headline back on screen pennsylvania school settles two webcam spy lawsuits for six hundred ten k the point is this is all hardwired and everything google announced five years ago
[01:55:39.980 --> 01:55:43.205]  That they are now accessing the camera and the microphone.
[01:55:43.266 --> 01:55:53.683]  Connect, that sold millions of video games for Microsoft, the platform has cameras, voice recognition, and admits they're watching and listening to you in your home.
[01:55:54.477 --> 01:55:55.457]  It's hooked to the internet.
[01:55:55.898 --> 01:55:58.379]  But see, it isn't just this EAS system.
[01:55:58.919 --> 01:56:02.641]  Finishing up with Richard, then John, Julio, and Don, I gotta move quick now, I apologize.
[01:56:02.681 --> 01:56:05.622]  I'm just trying to give everybody all the data here of how big this is.
[01:56:06.483 --> 01:56:12.005]  Richard in California, finishing up your point about your daughter's laptop getting hijacked?
[01:56:12.605 --> 01:56:15.347]  Yeah, my daughter's laptop, Saturday, it got hijacked.
[01:56:16.107 --> 01:56:22.670]  Somebody kept turning it on, and some application she downloaded for a video chat,
[01:56:23.385 --> 01:56:24.446]  It kept logging on.
[01:56:26.287 --> 01:56:29.790]  And, you know, my daughter wasn't at home, and I'm wondering what's going on here.
[01:56:29.950 --> 01:56:34.373]  Well, don't let your children be on computers unless you're standing right above them.
[01:56:34.413 --> 01:56:35.935]  I'm not criticizing you.
[01:56:35.955 --> 01:56:51.546]  I mean, they're ubiquitous, but you've got to... I remember people, I remember media 10 years ago being in my office and laughing at me because all the laptops that had cameras or computers with cameras had sticky tape over them, and they were like, oh, the government's watching you!
[01:56:54.318 --> 01:56:55.018]  Isn't it funny?
[01:56:55.419 --> 01:56:56.379]  But now it's all admitted.
[01:56:56.919 --> 01:56:57.760]  Yeah, it's all admitted.
[01:56:57.860 --> 01:56:58.220]  You're right.
[01:56:58.961 --> 01:56:59.301]  You're right.
[01:56:59.501 --> 01:57:00.161]  And thanks a lot.
[01:57:00.581 --> 01:57:01.342]  Richard, thank you.
[01:57:01.382 --> 01:57:02.062]  God bless you.
[01:57:02.142 --> 01:57:05.064]  I mean, folks, this is beyond 1984.
[01:57:05.124 --> 01:57:06.064]  They think they've got us.
[01:57:06.725 --> 01:57:11.027]  Now they're putting telescreens in at the shopping mall telling you to watch your neighbors.
[01:57:11.447 --> 01:57:14.669]  You're walking by and there's government announcements saying watch people.
[01:57:14.729 --> 01:57:15.650]  I mean, this isn't freedom.
[01:57:16.350 --> 01:57:18.091]  John in Texas, what do you do in the media?
[01:57:19.712 --> 01:57:21.113]  I actually own a hosting company.
[01:57:21.792 --> 01:57:24.495]  Okay, so what's your view on all the hardwired stuff they're putting in?
[01:57:26.016 --> 01:57:36.526]  It's scary and it's not good and it goes in with the whole, you know, non-neutral internet and just the controls they're putting over, you know, on top of us.
[01:57:37.467 --> 01:57:39.649]  And, you know, we're seeing a lot of consolidation in the market.
[01:57:39.689 --> 01:57:46.316]  You're seeing, you know, Verizon and Time Warner Telecom buying, you know, managed service provider cloud computing companies.
[01:57:47.111 --> 01:57:51.635]  So, you know, not only are they going to have, you know, control the transmission, but they'll have physical access to the servers.
[01:57:52.375 --> 01:57:52.795]  That's right.
[01:57:52.815 --> 01:58:04.424]  They're forcing the full integration away from you having your own servers or separate servers to giant kind of CDN clouds, for those that don't know, so that you can't even use a computer and physically hold the data yourself.
[01:58:04.884 --> 01:58:06.566]  To be accessed, it's got to be in the cloud.
[01:58:08.163 --> 01:58:08.783]  Exactly.
[01:58:09.504 --> 01:58:11.324]  And, you know, we're seeing more and more of this.
[01:58:11.384 --> 01:58:15.006]  But I'm seeing, you know, bigger companies, you know, getting into the game.
[01:58:15.046 --> 01:58:19.227]  Even Microsoft and Google themselves, you know, they're making big cloud plays.
[01:58:19.307 --> 01:58:22.709]  And now, you know, of course, you're seeing the telecommunication giants doing the same thing.
[01:58:24.689 --> 01:58:25.069]  Amazing.
[01:58:25.109 --> 01:58:26.250]  Do you have any other comments, John?
[01:58:28.022 --> 01:58:38.525]  Um, no, I mean, just, you know, the dangers of net neutrality, you know, them being able to control, you know, what you can and can't get to, and it's very easy to do with quality of service, and I mean, you know... Stay there!
[01:58:38.565 --> 01:58:41.846]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:53.941]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:58:54.181 --> 01:59:00.202]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:59:00.582 --> 01:59:07.663]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:59:07.963 --> 01:59:12.544]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[01:59:21.488 --> 01:59:25.232]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[01:59:25.754 --> 01:59:31.940]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:59:32.521 --> 01:59:35.944]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[01:59:44.492 --> 01:59:44.953]  Thank you.
[01:59:52.907 --> 01:59:54.829]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:55.289 --> 01:59:58.111]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:04.677 --> 02:00:05.338]  Big Brother.
[02:00:05.978 --> 02:00:07.059]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:07.760 --> 02:00:08.880]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:09.501 --> 02:00:10.342]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.102 --> 02:00:12.043]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.443 --> 02:00:16.267]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.847 --> 02:00:20.911]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.963 --> 02:00:27.625]  Talking about federal government censorship and takeover of the media grid.
[02:00:27.645 --> 02:00:32.767]  Talking to media professionals, engineers, program directors, IT professionals.
[02:00:33.728 --> 02:00:34.328]  Here's another one.
[02:00:34.348 --> 02:00:38.410]  DHS seizes websites for merely linking the copyrighted material.
[02:00:39.150 --> 02:00:41.231]  Even Reuters is reporting on this.
[02:00:41.971 --> 02:00:50.915]  Now sites that link to things that the government, no judge or jury, says are copyrighted, they're shutting them down.
[02:00:50.935 --> 02:00:51.776]  They're just seizing them.
[02:00:52.745 --> 02:01:02.690]  And we've got Tyrell Ventura, son of Jesse Ventura, one of the producers and people on the Conspiracy Theory Show, joining us to talk about Homeland Security just calling up and getting one of the episodes dropped.
[02:01:03.170 --> 02:01:09.433]  Dealing with FEMA camps and threat fusion centers and the EAS martial law system and the 10 FEMA governors.
[02:01:09.693 --> 02:01:12.595]  They do not want this being talked about.
[02:01:14.844 --> 02:01:30.605]  I want to get to Julio and Don, and I appreciate them holding, but real fast, John, yes, the bottom line, all the IT people admit this, and the government admits it, they're putting the grid in to end net neutrality, and that means end true free access of the web as we know it.
[02:01:32.028 --> 02:01:32.948]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:01:32.968 --> 02:01:39.912]  And I mean, Egypt, what we just saw, is the most extreme example of, you know, what net neutrality or non-net neutrality can lead to.
[02:01:39.932 --> 02:01:43.733]  Yeah, well the Internet2 stated plan is to slowly kill the original true web.
[02:01:44.054 --> 02:01:44.834]  Great to hear from you.
[02:01:44.874 --> 02:01:47.195]  Let's talk to Don in New York.
[02:01:47.235 --> 02:01:48.175]  Don, you're on the air.
[02:01:48.856 --> 02:01:49.396]  Hey, how are you?
[02:01:49.616 --> 02:01:50.336]  Good, thanks for holding.
[02:01:50.657 --> 02:01:51.457]  What do you do in media?
[02:01:52.117 --> 02:01:54.298]  I'm a installer engineer.
[02:01:54.578 --> 02:01:56.459]  I design and then install systems.
[02:01:56.479 --> 02:01:57.620]  Okay, what's your view on this?
[02:01:58.516 --> 02:01:59.317]  Well, you know what?
[02:01:59.377 --> 02:02:01.799]  Honestly, I've seen it a while back already.
[02:02:01.859 --> 02:02:07.284]  I've had to put them in high school stations and in college stations in my area.
[02:02:07.424 --> 02:02:08.926]  It's nothing new.
[02:02:09.106 --> 02:02:14.831]  I totally don't agree with it, but what can you do against it?
[02:02:16.473 --> 02:02:18.895]  I did want to tell you something about where I work now.
[02:02:18.915 --> 02:02:21.637]  I'm not going to tell you where it is over the phone, but I see
[02:02:23.180 --> 02:02:29.662]  I see Homeland Security getting involved in a lot of things on a very large level here and if you want to call me back I could talk to you.
[02:02:29.722 --> 02:02:34.243]  Sir, they've tried to recruit my dad and then he thought it was maybe a setup because he's my dad.
[02:02:34.523 --> 02:02:40.584]  He went and talked to the other dentist and Homeland Security separately had visited him at his home saying spy on your neighbors.
[02:02:40.944 --> 02:02:43.385]  I mean, they're getting ready for full takeover.
[02:02:43.425 --> 02:02:44.205]  It's now happening.
[02:02:44.605 --> 02:02:45.505]  I totally agree with you.
[02:02:45.545 --> 02:02:47.886]  What I'm saying is I'm a conference room manager and I
[02:02:49.008 --> 02:02:55.932]  Fortunately or unfortunately, you get to hear all kinds of stuff at the company I'm working for, and you'd probably be interested in some of it, but that's up to you.
[02:02:56.352 --> 02:02:57.073]  Well, yes, sir.
[02:02:57.373 --> 02:03:05.297]  The problem is we've kind of announced it here, and I mean, you've got to know, talking to me on the phone, there's probably 10 agencies listening.
[02:03:05.937 --> 02:03:10.100]  Now that you've said it, I mean, obviously they're now saying, I've got another report here,
[02:03:10.720 --> 02:03:15.902]  The federal government's announced that if the citizens look at WikiLeaks documents online, it's an act of espionage.
[02:03:15.922 --> 02:03:20.584]  In fact, I know that's in one of my stacks, but I mean, do we just put up with this?
[02:03:20.624 --> 02:03:25.846]  I mean, specifically, you're there witnessing government conferencing with the feds for takeover?
[02:03:27.456 --> 02:03:29.618]  I'd rather talk to you some other time.
[02:03:29.758 --> 02:03:36.103]  Because I already get internal videos and things that we go ahead and put out where they are admittedly doing it, so I already... Okay, fine.
[02:03:36.283 --> 02:03:41.027]  I will call you after the show in about an hour.
[02:03:41.067 --> 02:03:41.547]  How's that sound?
[02:03:41.567 --> 02:03:42.989]  Do you have my number?
[02:03:43.309 --> 02:03:48.153]  No, we're going to put you on hold and we're going to get your number, Don, and I'm going to call you, okay?
[02:03:49.514 --> 02:03:50.074]  All right, thank you.
[02:03:50.914 --> 02:03:53.475]  But I mean, I'm not saying, oh, I've already got all this.
[02:03:53.595 --> 02:03:54.835]  I've got the SLAT training.
[02:03:55.215 --> 02:04:00.796]  I've got the clergy response team training stuff.
[02:04:00.836 --> 02:04:01.856]  I've got the InfraGard.
[02:04:02.096 --> 02:04:06.797]  Folks, they've got over 500,000, quote, executives in this country.
[02:04:06.897 --> 02:04:07.677]  And they profile them.
[02:04:07.697 --> 02:04:10.078]  If the guy's a good guy, they don't ever tell them the full program.
[02:04:10.318 --> 02:04:17.079]  But if they're globalists, they give them the authorization under government code orders to their cell phones to kill people.
[02:04:18.004 --> 02:04:20.866]  I mean, they are building an army of pure evil.
[02:04:21.747 --> 02:04:23.689]  I couldn't sleep last night.
[02:04:23.709 --> 02:04:25.450]  I can't sleep now.
[02:04:26.651 --> 02:04:30.414]  I haven't had coffee yesterday, you know, afternoon.
[02:04:30.434 --> 02:04:32.456]  I wasn't up drinking coffee, folks.
[02:04:32.536 --> 02:04:35.318]  I laid there in bed, and I'm somebody who's always loved sleep.
[02:04:36.119 --> 02:04:38.021]  I could sleep 10 hours straight like the dead.
[02:04:39.178 --> 02:04:45.901]  My wife's always joked that there can be a thunderstorm above and the whole house shaking, you know, windows breaking, with trees falling down, I don't wake up.
[02:04:46.341 --> 02:04:47.261]  I can't sleep!
[02:04:47.701 --> 02:04:50.062]  Because I've studied the full spectrum breakdown!
[02:04:50.082 --> 02:04:51.383]  I mean, this is real!
[02:04:51.943 --> 02:04:52.984]  How else do I say it?
[02:04:53.004 --> 02:04:54.844]  It's so evil, it's happening!
[02:04:54.884 --> 02:04:56.045]  These people are criminals!
[02:04:59.958 --> 02:05:01.099]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:05:01.139 --> 02:05:07.805]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:05:08.066 --> 02:05:10.348]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:05:10.628 --> 02:05:15.793]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:05:15.993 --> 02:05:18.774]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:05:19.034 --> 02:05:21.155]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:05:21.355 --> 02:05:27.277]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:05:27.617 --> 02:05:30.798]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:05:30.978 --> 02:05:36.500]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:05:36.760 --> 02:05:38.080]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:05:38.400 --> 02:05:39.561]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:05:39.701 --> 02:05:42.241]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:05:42.381 --> 02:05:43.782]  He explains everything you need to know.
[02:05:44.002 --> 02:05:44.422]  We're good to go.
[02:05:59.995 --> 02:06:03.297]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[02:06:03.557 --> 02:06:04.638]  It ended on June of 2009.
[02:06:04.698 --> 02:06:09.080]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[02:06:09.261 --> 02:06:14.904]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[02:06:15.204 --> 02:06:17.185]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[02:06:17.345 --> 02:06:20.027]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[02:06:20.387 --> 02:06:26.691]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoodsDirect.
[02:06:26.871 --> 02:06:28.692]  They both make fabulous investments.
[02:06:29.092 --> 02:06:34.175]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[02:06:34.435 --> 02:06:39.418]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[02:06:39.718 --> 02:06:44.901]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[02:06:45.081 --> 02:06:48.023]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[02:06:48.263 --> 02:06:51.225]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[02:06:51.245 --> 02:06:52.266]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[02:07:00.572 --> 02:07:04.196]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:07:04.576 --> 02:07:07.579]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:07:07.839 --> 02:07:12.603]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:07:12.623 --> 02:07:18.869]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:07:19.029 --> 02:07:21.252]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:07:21.792 --> 02:07:23.373]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:07:23.413 --> 02:07:24.334]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:07:24.394 --> 02:07:26.795]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:07:40.683 --> 02:07:42.544]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:07:42.824 --> 02:07:47.608]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[02:07:47.968 --> 02:07:57.895]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:08:00.977 --> 02:08:06.561]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:09.008 --> 02:08:16.630]  We've had the FCC, diversity czar, say that the government should censor media in the U.S., like Hugo Chavez.
[02:08:16.650 --> 02:08:19.451]  We can play that clip for you, but it's been all over the news for a year.
[02:08:19.891 --> 02:08:27.793]  We've got Cass Sunstein, the White House regulations czar, saying, arrest people, or at least put a tax on, quote, conspiracy theories.
[02:08:28.213 --> 02:08:31.654]  And he went on to say, like not believing in man-made global warming.
[02:08:33.015 --> 02:08:36.418]  We've had internal pressure, and I've been asked to not get into all the details.
[02:08:36.438 --> 02:08:43.304]  You know, you're told things in confidence, and then you're asked not to get into it in full detail because of, you know, confidences you've been brought into.
[02:08:43.344 --> 02:08:47.027]  But now Jesse Ventura months ago on the show did say yes, it got censored.
[02:08:47.067 --> 02:08:56.776]  Homeland Security pressure on Time Warner, the parent company of TruTV, to not re-air the incredible police state show that dealt with FEMA takeover,
[02:08:57.296 --> 02:09:03.201]  Ten regions, the FEMA governors, the Threat Fusion Centers, the whole EAS system.
[02:09:04.122 --> 02:09:11.468]  And now, Obama announces yesterday on federal news radio, presidential emergency alerts to be tested.
[02:09:11.729 --> 02:09:13.690]  You know that, eh, eh, eh, emergency alert?
[02:09:14.671 --> 02:09:17.093]  Hard-wired, the government can take over every station in the country.
[02:09:17.393 --> 02:09:27.720]  They're announcing they're going to have forced alerts on your cell phone, video alerts on your iPhone or Droid, break-ins on your computer, telescreens at 9,000 locations, now going in.
[02:09:28.201 --> 02:09:33.184]  They're in hundreds of locations already, at the checkout line saying, watch your neighbors, don't trust other shoppers.
[02:09:33.504 --> 02:09:43.792]  This is right out of The Running Man that Jesse Ventura was in, where Schwarzenegger's walking around and seeing announcements about, report on your parents, kids, get a bonus, you know, payment from the government.
[02:09:44.472 --> 02:09:49.995]  It's incredible, and joining us for the rest of the hour is Tyrell Ventura.
[02:09:50.035 --> 02:09:54.638]  I talked to Ty over the weekend just about the future of the show.
[02:09:54.698 --> 02:09:56.699]  Will there be a third season of Conspiracy Theory?
[02:09:56.959 --> 02:09:58.300]  Hit show with Jesse Ventura.
[02:09:59.120 --> 02:10:01.561]  And so he's going to be talking about that today.
[02:10:01.761 --> 02:10:06.604]  Obviously, Jesse is going to be on with us when he first starts doing media, when he gets back in early April.
[02:10:07.164 --> 02:10:11.667]  He'll talk more about the TSA lawsuit, the groping I have witnessed, and I could be
[02:10:12.705 --> 02:10:12.945]  I don't
[02:10:33.775 --> 02:10:42.942]  Uh, videographer, you name it, and I look forward to working with Tyrell on our own ventures in the future because he's just a very informed, interesting guy.
[02:10:43.062 --> 02:10:46.404]  And so I just wanted to get him back on with us to talk about all of that.
[02:10:46.504 --> 02:10:49.687]  But dealing with censorship, there's so many layers of it.
[02:10:49.747 --> 02:10:51.228]  After the Tucson shooting, Ty, we...
[02:10:53.189 --> 02:10:55.931]  Saw the media trying to blame conservatives, liberals, the media.
[02:10:56.191 --> 02:11:03.895]  When the guy was out of his mind, schizophrenic, that's now admitted, who hated politics and was into the occult and taking hallucinogens every day.
[02:11:03.915 --> 02:11:10.479]  But we see this full push to tell us to sit down and shut up and don't be angry about what's happening.
[02:11:11.457 --> 02:11:15.098]  Yeah, and be scared of your neighbor because, God forbid, we talk to each other anymore.
[02:11:15.118 --> 02:11:28.044]  It's frightening, it's out there, but as long as we stay vigilant and aware of it and keep talking about it and hold their feet to the fire, we'll hopefully weather the storm.
[02:11:29.824 --> 02:11:35.026]  Even when you talked earlier about the show that never was rebroadcast, the thing that
[02:11:37.208 --> 02:11:40.751]  You know, you can't really censor something anymore in today's world.
[02:11:40.851 --> 02:11:44.394]  I mean, that shows all over the internet and people can see it if they look for it.
[02:11:44.775 --> 02:11:45.696]  So that's the good news.
[02:11:46.176 --> 02:11:51.941]  You know, the bad news is, yeah, you know, the more forms of communication, the more avenues they can to propagandize us as a society.
[02:11:52.562 --> 02:11:58.347]  You know, and that's what we've got to pay attention to and try to be able to see through all of their propaganda.
[02:11:59.468 --> 02:12:01.950]  Well, there were some groundbreaking episodes.
[02:12:02.070 --> 02:12:05.554]  I think the second season was even more hardcore than the last.
[02:12:05.594 --> 02:12:10.979]  But millions of viewers per episode, they air these things 30, 40 times afterwards.
[02:12:10.999 --> 02:12:13.521]  So we're talking about audiences in the tens of millions.
[02:12:14.602 --> 02:12:17.985]  That police state episode really scared the system.
[02:12:18.366 --> 02:12:19.046]  And for those that
[02:12:19.967 --> 02:12:20.768]  Don't know what happened.
[02:12:20.808 --> 02:12:39.444]  As much as you can tell folks, I mean I know the full story, you know the full story, we can't, we've been asked not to get into all of it or to respond to the congressman who's been attacking, but I have responded separately because he's been attacking your father and myself and others, but as much as you can tell folks about the pressures that were exerted.
[02:12:40.990 --> 02:12:42.370]  Well, you know, it's interesting.
[02:12:42.390 --> 02:12:46.731]  When we were doing the show and that all went down, you know, we're putting show out, you know, week after week.
[02:12:46.791 --> 02:12:53.892]  So when it happened, it kind of happened so quickly that we didn't really have time to think about it or pay attention to it because we're on to the next show.
[02:12:53.932 --> 02:12:59.454]  You know, once the show's locked in air, you know, we have to, you know, look at putting the next show on the air.
[02:12:59.974 --> 02:13:07.255]  So we didn't really have a lot of time to reflect on that because it would have, you know, damaged our ability to make our next show because, you know, you can't spend all
[02:13:07.799 --> 02:13:11.042]  Because you're busy editing these and tweaking them right up to broadcast.
[02:13:11.722 --> 02:13:12.203]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:13:12.283 --> 02:13:17.627]  I mean, you know, we want to make sure we get as much good content in there as possible with each show.
[02:13:17.667 --> 02:13:19.949]  So we're, you know, we're busting our humps doing that.
[02:13:19.969 --> 02:13:24.593]  You know, reflecting on it now, it's kind of like I said earlier, I mean, if anything it brought
[02:13:25.525 --> 02:13:29.549]  I mean, controversy, if anything, is good because it brought more attention to the show.
[02:13:29.770 --> 02:13:33.493]  If they didn't want people to pay attention to it, they should have just ignored it.
[02:13:35.095 --> 02:13:39.359]  But, you know, we upset Representative Cone and Senator Cone.
[02:13:42.734 --> 02:13:44.175]  Yelling and hollering to the heavens.
[02:13:44.215 --> 02:13:52.763]  And then, you know, just recently we saw the kind of hypocritical aspect of him, you know, in referring to yelling at people for referring to people as Nazis.
[02:13:52.803 --> 02:13:56.867]  And then he turns around and does the same thing and doesn't see the hypocrisy in it.
[02:13:56.947 --> 02:14:02.051]  But, you know, ultimately the show's out there and you can see it, which is the important thing, you know.
[02:14:02.192 --> 02:14:05.875]  And it was an amazing show to work on and definitely eye-opening.
[02:14:05.935 --> 02:14:07.536]  And, you know, thank you again for your help.
[02:14:09.337 --> 02:14:11.739]  Thank you again for your work on the show.
[02:14:11.839 --> 02:14:13.579]  It was a great show.
[02:14:13.599 --> 02:14:14.540]  One of my favorites of the year.
[02:14:30.249 --> 02:14:31.931]  Yeah, it was great.
[02:14:32.031 --> 02:14:34.012]  This whole last season was a great season.
[02:14:34.072 --> 02:14:40.257]  I mean, I was really happy with, you know, and let me say this too, I was really happy working with True TV.
[02:14:40.277 --> 02:14:46.342]  You know, they've gone out on a limb for us and put us on the air and have been very supportive of us.
[02:14:47.763 --> 02:14:57.933]  You know, apart from, you know, crazy moments like the police state thing or whatever, you know, they've really, they haven't censored us and they have never, you know, dictated content to us.
[02:14:58.033 --> 02:14:58.714]  Well, exactly.
[02:14:58.774 --> 02:15:03.038]  I mean, the head of the network pledged to your dad that they've never had censorship and there would be no problem.
[02:15:03.338 --> 02:15:10.886]  And then this was a wake-up call for them when higher-ups above them, with homeland security and congressional pressure, pulled the episode.
[02:15:11.506 --> 02:15:13.188]  And I've seen some other interesting things.
[02:15:13.208 --> 02:15:16.671]  The other more hardcore episodes, I've noticed, aren't being aired as much.
[02:15:17.071 --> 02:15:22.937]  So the system, I mean, you guys have the deathbed confession of E. Howard Hunt, first time on national television.
[02:15:22.957 --> 02:15:27.521]  I mean, you did so much groundbreaking things, but we should try to support
[02:15:28.061 --> 02:15:29.622]  And contact True TV.
[02:15:29.642 --> 02:15:39.585]  We're going to give out numbers and websites later and addresses to put counter pressure on to make sure a third season comes up and to try to get Police State back on the air.
[02:15:39.605 --> 02:15:48.929]  But Ty, for those that don't know about the episode, encapsulate that episode and what was covered there and what you thought was most disturbing about that piece.
[02:15:49.693 --> 02:16:00.995]  Well, you saw essentially the chain of information and how it flows through if government wants to spy on you, and then ultimately what could happen if the wrong people get in power.
[02:16:01.535 --> 02:16:17.979]  That's the biggest thing, is that when you're building FEMA camps, initially, yeah, they might be for helping people in terms of natural disaster and things like that, but the wording in the bill leaves it very open to be at the discretion of the head of Homeland Security.
[02:16:18.859 --> 02:16:26.203]  And that's a dangerous thing because, you know, we kind of have this weird feeling that, you know, every elected person is always a good person.
[02:16:26.923 --> 02:16:28.484]  You know, and that's not true sometimes.
[02:16:28.524 --> 02:16:30.845]  You know, you can have a rotten egg like in any aspect of society.
[02:16:30.865 --> 02:16:31.805]  Well, look at history!
[02:16:31.926 --> 02:16:33.866]  Or you can have a whole barrel of rotten eggs.
[02:16:33.887 --> 02:16:35.607]  Yeah, or a whole barrel of them.
[02:16:35.627 --> 02:16:42.871]  And if you get the wrong people in power and you don't, and you don't specifically, and you leave bills, especially in terms of building, you know,
[02:16:43.766 --> 02:16:44.527]  We're good to go.
[02:16:58.985 --> 02:16:59.906]  Well, I mean, more than that.
[02:16:59.986 --> 02:17:04.130]  You show the congressional hearings where they admitted these camps would be for citizens.
[02:17:04.691 --> 02:17:08.375]  You show the mainstream news articles where they said it could be for civil unrest.
[02:17:08.895 --> 02:17:10.777]  And that's what they're drilling and training for.
[02:17:10.797 --> 02:17:14.421]  I mean, so, so, and the way Cohen
[02:17:15.282 --> 02:17:18.185]  Tried to deny that the bill existed until your dad handed it to him.
[02:17:18.425 --> 02:17:20.707]  And he goes, oh, yes, I do believe.
[02:17:20.727 --> 02:17:27.934]  I mean, he was like something out of a, you know, old Southern movie or something like, you know, one of the women.
[02:17:27.994 --> 02:17:32.759]  It just shows that these guys, I don't think he even remembered or even thought of putting it in there.
[02:17:32.779 --> 02:17:35.141]  And it just shows how Lin, he's a co-sponsor of the bill.
[02:17:35.161 --> 02:17:36.102]  I think it just shows how.
[02:17:37.103 --> 02:17:40.787]  Very little politicians pay attention to what they're doing out there.
[02:17:40.807 --> 02:17:43.409]  You know, they see a bill, oh that sounds nice, let's push it through.
[02:17:43.670 --> 02:17:47.674]  Not reading the wording of it, not reading, you know, what's behind it and things like that.
[02:17:47.714 --> 02:17:49.736]  But Ty, Ty, you gave them the out.
[02:17:49.816 --> 02:17:55.201]  You gave them the out in the show, saying that, oh I bet he didn't know about it.
[02:17:55.462 --> 02:18:00.707]  But I mean, watching him in the video, he, you know, talking like Scarlett from Gone with the Wind, he's like...
[02:18:01.147 --> 02:18:04.570]  Oh, I do declare now, I do remember that bill.
[02:18:04.890 --> 02:18:09.854]  First he's like, you mean space aliens are going to come down and eat Major Governor Ventura?
[02:18:10.275 --> 02:18:14.718]  And he's like, no I'm not worried about space aliens, I'm worried about these camps.
[02:18:15.139 --> 02:18:16.280]  But there's no bill.
[02:18:16.600 --> 02:18:19.402]  Oh wait, I do remember this bill now.
[02:18:19.723 --> 02:18:21.304]  I mean, he looks so guilty.
[02:18:21.324 --> 02:18:22.265]  I'm sorry.
[02:18:23.663 --> 02:18:28.146]  Well, I mean, you put it on television and that's what happens.
[02:18:31.207 --> 02:18:42.994]  The show speaks for itself in my opinion and like I said, it's one of my favorites because we really hit all the major elements from the fusion centers to the camps to the very creepy coffins.
[02:18:44.755 --> 02:18:50.218]  It was a great show to put on the air along with all the other fantastic shows we did this last year.
[02:18:50.848 --> 02:18:58.091]  Well, he also said on CNN, he was like, how dare them say the government might release a bioweapon?
[02:18:58.411 --> 02:18:59.831]  How dare them?
[02:19:00.011 --> 02:19:07.614]  When we have all these admitted secret tests in the syphilis and the atomic soldiers, and it just came out our government was shooting up kids in Guatemala with syphilis.
[02:19:08.014 --> 02:19:11.675]  I mean, how dare him go, how dare you, Tyrell?
[02:19:11.695 --> 02:19:15.517]  Well, you know, I mean, I think there's people that truly believe that
[02:19:16.696 --> 02:19:22.343]  Governments do no wrong in life, and it's so idiotic, you know?
[02:19:22.363 --> 02:19:31.694]  I mean, it boggles the mind that people can be either so naive, or, you know, when they're caught red-handed doing something wrong, they'll forever deny and make counter-accusations.
[02:19:31.714 --> 02:19:34.157]  You caught me red-handed, Tyrell!
[02:19:34.478 --> 02:19:37.021]  You and your wicked father, Jesse Ventura!
[02:19:38.385 --> 02:19:39.126]  I'm going to stop.
[02:19:40.607 --> 02:19:41.227]  Ty, stay there.
[02:19:41.247 --> 02:19:44.209]  I want to talk about what some of your favorite episodes were, the future of the show.
[02:19:44.810 --> 02:19:50.534]  You want to talk to Tyrell Ventura, one of the executive producers on the hit show Conspiracy Theory.
[02:19:50.554 --> 02:19:50.594]  800-259-9231.
[02:19:50.614 --> 02:19:50.654]  800-259-9231.
[02:19:57.078 --> 02:20:00.081]  9231.
[02:19:57.159 --> 02:20:00.081]  I do declare, get that show off the air!
[02:20:00.182 --> 02:20:01.423]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:20:01.463 --> 02:20:06.828]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:20:07.048 --> 02:20:11.673]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:20:12.073 --> 02:20:15.136]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[02:20:15.357 --> 02:20:17.138]  And it's possible that it could even happen again.
[02:20:17.639 --> 02:20:19.481]  So our friends at Solutions from Science
[02:20:19.741 --> 02:20:20.241]  We're good to go!
[02:20:47.765 --> 02:20:48.765]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:20:49.185 --> 02:20:56.488]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:20:56.828 --> 02:20:59.268]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:20:59.829 --> 02:21:00.969]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:21:00.989 --> 02:21:07.171]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:21:07.971 --> 02:21:10.273]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:21:10.533 --> 02:21:15.757]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:21:15.937 --> 02:21:18.739]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:21:18.879 --> 02:21:21.021]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:21:21.221 --> 02:21:27.165]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:21:27.506 --> 02:21:30.688]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:21:30.888 --> 02:21:38.010]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[02:21:38.350 --> 02:21:39.570]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:21:39.650 --> 02:21:42.211]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:21:42.331 --> 02:21:46.412]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:21:46.572 --> 02:21:51.013]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:21:51.133 --> 02:21:53.614]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[02:23:55.625 --> 02:24:16.665]  Uh, here is Congressman, uh, Steve Cohen doing his, uh,
[02:24:18.075 --> 02:24:26.620]  Scarlett from Gone with the Wind Imitation and Ventura's giving him the bill and he's just saying, uh, space monsters are coming down out of big green machines.
[02:24:26.700 --> 02:24:27.660]  I don't know about them.
[02:24:27.680 --> 02:24:29.841]  And he goes, I'm not talking about space monsters.
[02:24:30.321 --> 02:24:31.442]  And he goes, here's the bill.
[02:24:31.502 --> 02:24:33.903]  He goes, oh, I do remember that.
[02:24:34.164 --> 02:24:34.624]  Here it is.
[02:24:35.844 --> 02:24:39.486]  There isn't one FEMA camp of these in the United States right now.
[02:24:39.806 --> 02:24:40.307]  There are not.
[02:24:40.767 --> 02:24:41.948]  Um, why is it in that bill?
[02:24:43.004 --> 02:24:44.084]  What is exactly in the bill?
[02:24:44.124 --> 02:24:46.685]  Which talks about building FEMA camps, doesn't it?
[02:24:47.105 --> 02:24:49.126]  That particular bill that we're talking about?
[02:24:49.146 --> 02:24:52.167]  I would have to... I'd like to see the bill.
[02:24:54.207 --> 02:24:56.888]  Isn't this guy a co-sponsor of the bill?
[02:24:59.629 --> 02:25:00.469]  What's the bill number?
[02:25:02.572 --> 02:25:05.394]  Six FEMA camps have been built within the United States.
[02:25:05.794 --> 02:25:11.357]  How can a bill state that there'll be six FEMA camps built in the United States and then I'm being told there are none?
[02:25:11.777 --> 02:25:22.122]  Well, I think, you know, I think I recall now something about this and I, and if I'm correct, I think those are locations for if there's a disaster like in Katrina.
[02:25:22.142 --> 02:25:23.103]  I think that's what it is.
[02:25:23.163 --> 02:25:27.105]  It's not any kind of a concentration camp or anything to round up citizens.
[02:25:27.605 --> 02:25:29.226]  He thinks that's what it is?
[02:25:30.174 --> 02:25:36.956]  The bill that he co-sponsored says the use of the camps will be determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security.
[02:25:37.616 --> 02:25:39.256]  They can come and go as they please.
[02:25:39.276 --> 02:25:39.436]  Exactly.
[02:25:39.456 --> 02:25:40.397]  They won't be locked.
[02:25:40.577 --> 02:25:40.937]  No, no, no.
[02:25:40.977 --> 02:25:44.057]  They can go in and out because the place I saw in Texas is locked.
[02:25:44.758 --> 02:25:46.138]  You can't go in and out of it.
[02:25:46.758 --> 02:25:47.538]  No comment.
[02:25:47.558 --> 02:25:50.259]  Well, it's probably not being used either for a couple of years.
[02:25:50.279 --> 02:25:54.200]  Well, we have films of children playing on the swings and the slides and stuff.
[02:25:54.660 --> 02:25:57.642]  And this one technically falls under Homeland Security.
[02:25:57.942 --> 02:25:58.783]  Well, I don't know.
[02:25:59.003 --> 02:26:00.804]  I haven't been there, and I don't know who the children are.
[02:26:00.824 --> 02:26:02.465]  And the children are probably very happy.
[02:26:02.905 --> 02:26:03.806]  Where have we heard that before?
[02:26:03.826 --> 02:26:04.566]  Alright, that's enough.
[02:26:04.586 --> 02:26:07.688]  Ty, this is a short segment, long one coming up to get into everything.
[02:26:07.728 --> 02:26:11.811]  But, I mean, I don't know what he's so angry about.
[02:26:11.851 --> 02:26:13.232]  I mean, you guys were very fair with him.
[02:26:14.056 --> 02:26:15.216]  Yeah, no, we were, we were.
[02:26:17.337 --> 02:26:27.001]  He's angry because he got caught with beer and headlights, you know, and he didn't know what was in his own bill until we had to remind him.
[02:26:28.581 --> 02:26:35.264]  Politicians don't exactly like that, when you catch them not prepared and when you show them for their true colors.
[02:26:38.425 --> 02:26:44.786]  Now, twice on the tape, exactly twice on the tape Ty, he talks about green monsters coming out of machines.
[02:26:45.427 --> 02:26:47.327]  Did he do that more in the full interview?
[02:26:47.347 --> 02:26:48.227]  I mean, that was pretty weird.
[02:26:48.247 --> 02:27:06.071]  No, I mean, we put the bulk of the interview on there and, you know, essentially, you know, it's just, you know, it gives back to that simple fact that, you know, a lot of people just refuse to believe that government, that their government can do bad things.
[02:27:06.816 --> 02:27:13.079]  I think what really upset him was your dad at the end saying, think it can't happen here, it already has.
[02:27:13.099 --> 02:27:13.759]  You think you got 50 states?
[02:27:13.779 --> 02:27:16.040]  We got 10 FEMA regions run by 10 governors you didn't vote for.
[02:27:16.060 --> 02:27:16.340]  Powerful!
[02:27:30.216 --> 02:27:30.997]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:27:31.537 --> 02:27:33.479]  If they're not afraid, keep it all above board.
[02:27:33.539 --> 02:27:43.287]  Let's have transparency in government and let's see what they're doing so that way we can be informed populists and make the votes and do things that count.
[02:27:43.307 --> 02:27:48.151]  Truthfully, when it's all said and done, this country is run by its corporate handlers and we don't.
[02:27:48.672 --> 02:27:53.696]  We have the illusion of choice and we have the illusion of that, but we really don't have any choice.
[02:27:55.037 --> 02:27:58.540]  We just have to get that back and fight to get our country back.
[02:27:59.335 --> 02:28:02.236]  What is your favorite episode of the eight episodes?
[02:28:03.297 --> 02:28:12.500]  My truthful favorite in the storytelling and I mean they're all great, fantastic, you know, great information, great entertainment, but my true favorite is probably the JFK Show.
[02:28:13.040 --> 02:28:13.560]  Yeah.
[02:28:13.941 --> 02:28:24.385]  You know, it was the one where when we finished, you know, and Jesse saw the cut of it before it went to air and then, you know, Dad felt really proud that he could finally have his name on that
[02:28:25.545 --> 02:28:52.262]  You know, on that conspiracy, he was able to present new information, and then the groundbreaking confession of E. Howard Hunt, and you know, that's been a lifelong passion of his, JFK, and for him to be able to put a show out there that stated his viewpoints on it, and stated true, you know, fact about the case, you know, that really, really, really meant a lot to him in his life, and so as a son, and also as someone working with him to see that kind of
[02:28:53.484 --> 02:28:54.565]  What's your next favorite?
[02:29:06.038 --> 02:29:10.780]  Uh, my next favorite is probably Police Day, just because it was so controversial and really, you know, ruffled the feathers.
[02:29:11.081 --> 02:29:13.201]  You know, because that's what you like to do, you know what I mean?
[02:29:13.221 --> 02:29:23.226]  We work in a business where you gotta, you know, it's entertainment, but if you can put truth in entertainment and, you know, get people really paying attention, that's why we do what we do.
[02:29:23.526 --> 02:29:27.168]  You know, we gotta entertain you for an hour, and at the same time, we wanna educate you for an hour.
[02:29:28.300 --> 02:29:29.020]  Absolutely.
[02:29:29.080 --> 02:29:31.502]  At least it gets you asking questions.
[02:29:31.582 --> 02:29:38.245]  Even if we end up, like, if we do a conspiracy and it ends up being disproved and it was wrong, and we were wrong, hey, you know what?
[02:29:38.305 --> 02:29:44.928]  At least we got people asking the questions to find out, you know, is this something that could happen?
[02:29:44.948 --> 02:29:48.029]  But Ty, you haven't been proven wrong and that's why they're so upset.
[02:29:48.229 --> 02:29:49.930]  We'll be right back to talk about the TSA.
[02:29:50.230 --> 02:29:51.190]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.631 --> 02:29:53.231]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.152 --> 02:29:56.853]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:30:59.517 --> 02:31:03.740]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:04.060 --> 02:31:04.661]  Number 1.
[02:31:04.981 --> 02:31:08.123]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:08.404 --> 02:31:08.964]  Number 2.
[02:31:09.264 --> 02:31:13.808]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:14.148 --> 02:31:14.588]  It's true.
[02:31:14.888 --> 02:31:19.452]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:19.772 --> 02:31:20.312]  Number 3.
[02:31:20.593 --> 02:31:23.875]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:24.175 --> 02:31:27.878]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:28.078 --> 02:31:28.638]  Number 4.
[02:31:28.878 --> 02:31:31.239]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:31.639 --> 02:31:35.020]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:35.320 --> 02:31:35.520]  Number 5.
[02:31:36.100 --> 02:31:40.021]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:31:40.241 --> 02:31:45.023]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:31:45.303 --> 02:31:49.324]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:49.484 --> 02:31:51.025]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:51.265 --> 02:31:55.866]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[02:31:56.186 --> 02:31:56.226]  877-327-0365.
[02:31:59.369 --> 02:32:02.831]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[02:32:03.192 --> 02:32:07.235]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[02:32:07.475 --> 02:32:12.258]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[02:32:12.398 --> 02:32:17.362]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[02:32:18.122 --> 02:32:21.625]  Not worried about them moving south.
[02:32:21.785 --> 02:32:25.167]  Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[02:32:27.891 --> 02:32:32.277]  I'm looking for America.
[02:32:33.438 --> 02:32:34.880]  We're American and be proud.
[02:32:35.061 --> 02:32:38.165]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[02:32:38.305 --> 02:32:41.869]  Land on the free and the home of the brave.
[02:32:42.190 --> 02:32:46.115]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[02:32:53.863 --> 02:32:58.429]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[02:33:58.773 --> 02:34:00.334]  Tyrell Ventura is our guest.
[02:34:00.354 --> 02:34:10.436]  I want to get into his dad who filed his lawsuit against the TSA groping of him and the violation of the American Disabilities Act because they're discriminating against him because of his titanium hip.
[02:34:10.456 --> 02:34:13.397]  I want to get more into the show, but Ty, you're doing a lot of other things too.
[02:34:13.997 --> 02:34:22.739]  You've got a feature film coming out that you've directed that's got some major New World Order veins in it.
[02:34:22.819 --> 02:34:23.539]  Tell us about that.
[02:34:24.298 --> 02:34:25.178]  Well, I didn't direct it.
[02:34:25.218 --> 02:34:30.240]  I actually had the great honor and pleasure of working with a fantastic writer-director named Leighton Matz.
[02:34:30.260 --> 02:34:31.841]  That's right, you produced it then, I forgot.
[02:34:31.921 --> 02:34:35.062]  Yeah, I helped him produce it, along with Tiffany Conner.
[02:34:36.122 --> 02:34:38.523]  He's put together a great movie.
[02:34:38.563 --> 02:34:42.244]  We're in post-production right now, and it's been a great honor working with him.
[02:34:42.264 --> 02:34:45.846]  He's a fellow Texan, comes from east Texas.
[02:34:47.006 --> 02:34:50.832]  You know, get some good visuals out there and then shoot a lot back here in L.A.
[02:34:50.872 --> 02:34:52.775]  and it's coming together really nicely.
[02:34:52.815 --> 02:34:57.662]  That's kind of what I've been doing in my off-season when not working on Conspiracy Theory.
[02:34:57.702 --> 02:35:02.710]  Like I said, it was a great honor working with him and watching him create a hell of a movie.
[02:35:03.630 --> 02:35:04.391]  I don't know.
[02:35:23.404 --> 02:35:24.785]  So another way through fiction to wake people up.
[02:35:49.258 --> 02:35:49.939]  Exactly, yeah.
[02:35:50.019 --> 02:35:53.381]  I mean, you know, I think you have to do that.
[02:35:53.501 --> 02:36:00.426]  You know, you can tell an entertaining story and also educate people at the same time, which is what we as filmmakers try to do.
[02:36:01.366 --> 02:36:03.888]  Which we need a little bit more of, I think, in filmmaking right now.
[02:36:03.928 --> 02:36:06.810]  I think it's a little too popcorn, a little too crazy right now.
[02:36:06.850 --> 02:36:13.494]  We need some really good heartfelt drama that educates us and gets us to feel, and you know, that's why we go to the movies.
[02:36:13.815 --> 02:36:15.195]  That's why I love this business so much.
[02:36:15.516 --> 02:36:17.297]  Can you tell us a little bit about the plot?
[02:36:18.482 --> 02:36:32.347]  Yeah, it's roughly about a man who we see at the beginning of the movie, and he's kind of crazed on drugs and going nuts, and the next moment you see him in the film, he wakes up in Texas and has no memory of who he is.
[02:36:32.867 --> 02:36:42.291]  And he finds a brother who doesn't like him, and he spends the rest of the movie trying to discover who his old self was, and the more he discovers, the more he
[02:36:43.411 --> 02:36:47.513]  He dislikes and is frightened by who he was in the past.
[02:36:47.593 --> 02:36:57.438]  It's a great kind of mystery and adventure and ultimately a really great piece about two brothers trying to reconnect with each other.
[02:36:57.458 --> 02:36:59.059]  It's going to be a fun movie.
[02:36:59.079 --> 02:37:00.320]  I think people will really enjoy it.
[02:37:00.380 --> 02:37:02.721]  Sounds like a little mind control is in there.
[02:37:04.742 --> 02:37:05.042]  Maybe.
[02:37:05.062 --> 02:37:06.743]  You just have to watch the movie and find out.
[02:37:07.383 --> 02:37:10.945]  And when is it going to start being in film festivals and stuff so folks can see it?
[02:37:11.936 --> 02:37:13.498]  I can't say right now.
[02:37:13.898 --> 02:37:17.061]  Like I said, we're just finishing up and we're in the middle of post-production right now.
[02:37:17.561 --> 02:37:21.144]  But hopefully, you know, sometime summer, fall, that kind of thing.
[02:37:21.164 --> 02:37:24.727]  You know, as soon as we can get it done and we're all happy with it, we'll start putting it out to the public.
[02:37:24.807 --> 02:37:29.071]  Well, promise me that you and the director, you the producer and the director, will come on the show.
[02:37:29.331 --> 02:37:31.013]  And if you're in Texas, come in studio with us.
[02:37:31.833 --> 02:37:32.514]  Oh, we'd love to.
[02:37:32.654 --> 02:37:34.876]  That would be a fantastic, fantastic interview.
[02:37:34.916 --> 02:37:36.077]  And I can't wait for you to see the film.
[02:37:36.758 --> 02:37:38.959]  Now, I want to get into your father and the TSA.
[02:37:39.019 --> 02:37:40.360]  People really want to hear about that.
[02:37:40.760 --> 02:37:57.609]  But finishing up with the future of the show, I'm sure you know, and I was sent internal documents from a cable company, it is true there were also orders sent out for DVRs to be remotely contacted and to erase the police state episode and now other episodes of the show.
[02:37:57.670 --> 02:38:00.231]  So, A, have you heard anything about this?
[02:38:00.271 --> 02:38:03.073]  Because talking to you on the phone, I forgot to bring this up to you.
[02:38:03.413 --> 02:38:05.414]  I'm just now bringing it up to you live on air.
[02:38:06.434 --> 02:38:10.257]  Really, I don't know anything about that, so it's kind of hard for me to comment on that.
[02:38:10.277 --> 02:38:13.140]  Yeah, I mean, I know the cycle of television.
[02:38:13.160 --> 02:38:19.505]  They don't keep things on DVR for too long, but it's the first time I've ever heard about that, and it is interesting to look into it.
[02:38:20.045 --> 02:38:22.307]  Yeah, but we're talking about them remoting in.
[02:38:22.808 --> 02:38:25.650]  Not that it's available for you to go choose on on-demand.
[02:38:25.930 --> 02:38:28.352]  They're going into recorded copies and getting rid of it.
[02:38:29.253 --> 02:38:30.434]  Yeah, I know.
[02:38:31.510 --> 02:38:33.352]  You know what, I look at that as kind of a badge of honor.
[02:38:33.372 --> 02:38:36.575]  That means that we're scaring the hell out of them when we're telling the truth.
[02:38:36.615 --> 02:38:37.596]  And if they're that nervous about it, good.
[02:38:53.032 --> 02:38:56.336]  I guess in a way, your dad's going to win the bet.
[02:38:56.717 --> 02:38:58.759]  He didn't believe it was ever going to make it on air.
[02:38:59.119 --> 02:39:03.565]  So in a way, your dad turns out to be basically right.
[02:39:03.585 --> 02:39:05.487]  He said, I can't believe this is going to get on air.
[02:39:05.767 --> 02:39:07.650]  Privately, he didn't believe it was going to go on air.
[02:39:07.990 --> 02:39:11.094]  Not just the first season, but he wasn't even sure completely about the second.
[02:39:12.386 --> 02:39:20.031]  Well, I mean, hey, we got on air, and I think one of the big reasons we got on air is because people went through TV and let them know that they wanted to see it.
[02:39:20.151 --> 02:39:28.437]  You know, the Nielsen system is a very antiquated system, and so, you know, us, the TV companies, are big on, you know, letters and things like that.
[02:39:28.517 --> 02:39:39.484]  And, you know, I think that we had such a great response from people after the first season, you know, writing into True TV and leaving messages on the comment boards on their website.
[02:39:39.964 --> 02:39:41.225]  You know, that speaks volumes.
[02:39:41.265 --> 02:39:45.526]  I mean, every one letter, you know, could equal 1,000, 2,000, 3,000, 5,000 people.
[02:39:46.026 --> 02:39:50.748]  And then that, you know, that simple task dictates a lot of programming.
[02:39:50.848 --> 02:39:55.069]  You know, at the end of the day, they want ratings and they want, you know, and they want to be able to put out good shows.
[02:39:55.290 --> 02:40:07.434]  And like I said, they're a great company and they've been good to us and have allowed us to put things on the air that, like, yeah, we never thought anyone would ever see in the light of day on television, basic cable.
[02:40:08.335 --> 02:40:18.624]  But we have, and that's because of the viewers, and that's because of our audience being so dedicated and following the show, and then writing to TruTV and letting them know that they want to see it again.
[02:40:19.004 --> 02:40:22.027]  So please, if you want to see us back for a third season, do it again.
[02:40:22.047 --> 02:40:27.152]  Write in and let TruTV know that you want to see more Conspiracy Theory.
[02:40:27.557 --> 02:40:37.230]  Well, Tom, I'm glad you brought this up because that's one of the reasons I, you know, when I called you this weekend and you called me back, I said, look, did that help having my listeners lobby?
[02:40:37.270 --> 02:40:38.091]  You said, yes, it did.
[02:40:38.112 --> 02:40:42.558]  And I said, well, let's let's do it again because it was hit or miss if there was even going to be a second season.
[02:40:42.998 --> 02:40:44.920]  Do you have the best website for people to visit?
[02:40:59.490 --> 02:41:09.361]  Yeah, go over, you can write to 600 3rd Avenue, New York, New York, I believe it's 10016, that's True TV's address, so if you want to write right there.
[02:41:09.861 --> 02:41:17.729]  If you go online to the truetv.com website, you go under Contact Us, and they actually have a special heading under Programming for...
[02:41:18.630 --> 02:41:19.491]  We're good to go.
[02:41:38.079 --> 02:41:39.701]  I do read every letter that we get.
[02:41:39.821 --> 02:41:42.625]  I do read every congratulatory letter.
[02:41:42.705 --> 02:41:45.308]  I do read every negative letter I read.
[02:41:45.568 --> 02:41:49.092]  And then also it's great because people send us show ideas.
[02:41:49.453 --> 02:41:56.722]  And then, you know, I read through all of that just because you never know when you get one good nugget that helps fill in a piece of the puzzle to make a great episode for next year.
[02:41:57.242 --> 02:42:02.845]  Well, folks can go to TruTV.com or just type in Jesse Ventura Conspiracy Theory.
[02:42:02.865 --> 02:42:03.726]  It'll be the top link.
[02:42:04.006 --> 02:42:05.086]  They can contact there.
[02:42:05.767 --> 02:42:08.648]  They can also look it up online and find the phone numbers to TruTV.
[02:42:09.269 --> 02:42:11.290]  You can, the physical mail.
[02:42:11.350 --> 02:42:12.970]  It's so important.
[02:42:13.111 --> 02:42:16.012]  Everything we do, resistance is victory.
[02:42:16.072 --> 02:42:21.815]  And people that want to hear the truth, people that want to see well-produced information like this, if you believe in it, you want it.
[02:42:21.835 --> 02:42:23.376]  Because I keep getting calls, Ty, constantly.
[02:42:23.656 --> 02:42:24.717]  Is there going to be a third season?
[02:42:25.137 --> 02:42:26.318]  Will you be involved, Alex?
[02:42:26.918 --> 02:42:27.538]  What's happening?
[02:42:27.558 --> 02:42:28.639]  What's Jesse gonna do?
[02:42:29.359 --> 02:42:32.540]  And so now we've got you here today.
[02:42:32.600 --> 02:42:35.462]  Give out that mailing address one more time.
[02:42:36.152 --> 02:42:38.833]  Once again, it's 600 3rd Avenue, New York, New York.
[02:42:38.913 --> 02:42:40.294]  I believe 10016.
[02:42:40.514 --> 02:42:43.675]  You might double check that, but yeah, that's the mailing address.
[02:42:43.755 --> 02:42:45.136]  And then, you know, it's great.
[02:42:45.196 --> 02:42:47.257]  I mean, we had a great second season.
[02:42:47.337 --> 02:42:51.498]  We're going along normal right now in terms of whether or not it'll be a third season.
[02:42:51.518 --> 02:42:54.860]  There's been nothing weird, you know, that way or anything strange.
[02:42:55.380 --> 02:43:02.103]  You know, we're in our kind of time off to take a breather and then, you know, keep our ear to the ground for what potential shows we could do next season.
[02:43:03.283 --> 02:43:07.044]  You know, hopefully we'll get the green light and start working again, you know.
[02:43:07.724 --> 02:43:10.625]  If Jesse can fly, I don't know if we'll find that one.
[02:43:19.328 --> 02:43:22.849]  Not just writing to that address, not just going to TruTV and emailing them.
[02:43:23.129 --> 02:43:40.512]  We're exposing the open announcement that not just public telescreens saying spy on your neighbor, but they're now going to use the FEMA takeover boxes and all broadcast TV, radio and cable to start breaking in with Obama's video and voice on radio telling you to basically spy on your neighbors.
[02:43:40.792 --> 02:43:44.373]  The key article and video that we stayed up all night producing that breaks this down.
[02:43:44.733 --> 02:43:47.614]  Obama launches total takeover of media.
[02:43:48.561 --> 02:43:48.989]  System.
[02:43:50.427 --> 02:43:56.291]  Again, Obama launches total takeover of media system, emergency alert system.
[02:43:57.411 --> 02:44:02.194]  And it is so important that you get the video and all this out to everybody.
[02:44:02.614 --> 02:44:06.137]  And I only mentioned it for like one minute in the last hour.
[02:44:06.157 --> 02:44:09.018]  And when I've done that before, we haven't gotten the number one Google search term.
[02:44:09.619 --> 02:44:11.840]  I normally need to hammer it for that to happen.
[02:44:11.900 --> 02:44:18.084]  Folks, right now type Obama launches takeover into Google over and over again.
[02:44:18.144 --> 02:44:19.465]  Obama launches takeover.
[02:44:20.445 --> 02:44:23.088]  And let's make that the number one term.
[02:44:23.208 --> 02:44:25.651]  Obama launches takeover.
[02:44:25.671 --> 02:44:31.298]  That is so important to put that in the search engine.
[02:44:32.299 --> 02:44:34.541]  Also Obama takeover media.
[02:44:34.561 --> 02:44:36.704]  We want to make that the second term on Google.
[02:44:36.824 --> 02:44:38.145]  Obama takeover
[02:44:39.226 --> 02:44:41.607]  Media and Obama launches takeover.
[02:44:41.647 --> 02:44:43.148]  Those are two separate search terms.
[02:44:43.548 --> 02:44:45.589]  Let's break through the electronic Berlin Wall.
[02:44:45.829 --> 02:44:51.092]  Let's expose their attempt to attack the media and the alternative media, just like we did with the TSA.
[02:44:51.152 --> 02:44:51.652]  It's admitted.
[02:44:51.912 --> 02:44:52.593]  We launched that.
[02:44:52.973 --> 02:44:54.433]  It's admitted we've launched so many other things.
[02:44:54.513 --> 02:44:54.994]  You've done it.
[02:44:55.194 --> 02:44:56.614]  Obama launches takeovers.
[02:44:56.654 --> 02:44:57.535]  The first search term.
[02:44:57.775 --> 02:45:01.077]  The second search term is Obama takeover media.
[02:45:01.157 --> 02:45:02.557]  Put those in over and over again.
[02:45:02.577 --> 02:45:03.558]  The three words Obama,
[02:45:04.338 --> 02:45:06.600]  Launches takeover is one search term in Obama.
[02:45:07.301 --> 02:45:09.723]  Takeover media is the second three words you put in together.
[02:45:09.963 --> 02:45:10.864]  Let's do it together.
[02:45:11.105 --> 02:45:12.206]  Let's make it number one.
[02:45:12.266 --> 02:45:13.667]  It should be number one in the next three hours.
[02:45:14.207 --> 02:45:17.771]  Ty, getting into your father now, we again appreciate you talking about this.
[02:45:19.212 --> 02:45:21.554]  I know from flying with him, he is upset.
[02:45:21.995 --> 02:45:22.916]  Other people are upset.
[02:45:22.936 --> 02:45:24.117]  It's a carnival atmosphere.
[02:45:24.137 --> 02:45:24.918]  He's a celebrity.
[02:45:25.158 --> 02:45:26.299]  People gather around.
[02:45:26.819 --> 02:45:29.262]  He said on my show, they grab his genitals, they go, you know,
[02:45:29.997 --> 02:45:31.559]  You know, Hinduism, I'm not even going to say it.
[02:45:31.879 --> 02:45:34.062]  They're now admitting they're going into other people's pants.
[02:45:34.403 --> 02:45:36.005]  There's a huge revolt against this.
[02:45:36.345 --> 02:45:41.071]  He's filed a lawsuit and it's gotten national media attention.
[02:45:41.812 --> 02:45:42.754]  What can you say about that?
[02:45:43.578 --> 02:45:47.681]  Well, I can't comment on the lawsuit because it is a lawsuit and things like that.
[02:45:47.721 --> 02:45:56.968]  I can talk about my own experiences with it, which I've been groped and I've had to go into the microwave machine because they didn't even give me the option of being searched before.
[02:45:57.868 --> 02:45:59.389]  It's not fun at all.
[02:45:59.590 --> 02:46:03.032]  In fact, the good thing is the microwave machine didn't work on me because I'm too tall.
[02:46:03.813 --> 02:46:10.858]  So I'm happy about that, which once again shows how idiotic it is.
[02:46:11.698 --> 02:46:16.721]  But no, I can't comment directly on the lawsuit because it is a pending lawsuit and all that.
[02:46:16.961 --> 02:46:24.546]  I think it speaks for itself and hopefully we'll see what happens and we'll see what becomes of that.
[02:46:26.387 --> 02:46:35.193]  But it works out and it's a good blow against the system to try to get them to make airlines safer without invading our rights.
[02:46:35.453 --> 02:46:37.194]  And it can be done.
[02:46:37.895 --> 02:46:43.860]  Well, Ty, as you know, and I guess we talk privately about this, so I know the inside baseball, and I've talked to your dad off air.
[02:46:43.920 --> 02:46:47.883]  I mean, I knew months before they were launching the suit they were, but he said, don't talk about it.
[02:46:48.003 --> 02:46:49.744]  When I get back, I'll talk about it.
[02:46:50.105 --> 02:46:53.788]  And so I guess when he gets back in April, obviously he's going to need to respond.
[02:46:53.808 --> 02:46:55.149]  You know, the media tried to spin it.
[02:46:55.229 --> 02:46:57.070]  Oh, Ventura wants publicity.
[02:46:57.150 --> 02:46:59.852]  I happen to know your dad turns down most big TV interviews.
[02:47:00.153 --> 02:47:02.775]  He refused to talk to the international media on this.
[02:47:04.215 --> 02:47:06.296]  He told me when we flew, he said, I can't do this anymore.
[02:47:06.336 --> 02:47:07.196]  I got to get out of here.
[02:47:07.816 --> 02:47:15.198]  Every time he flies, to be groped, and then to have The View and others make jokes about it and laugh at him, and say, oh, he's a man.
[02:47:15.258 --> 02:47:17.278]  Why does he care if somebody grabs his genitals?
[02:47:17.618 --> 02:47:19.079]  I mean, I've had Ron Paul on.
[02:47:19.139 --> 02:47:21.519]  He's angry about it and says they've grabbed his genitals.
[02:47:21.819 --> 02:47:25.180]  I mean, this is about government training us to put up with anything.
[02:47:25.999 --> 02:47:26.499]  Exactly.
[02:47:26.519 --> 02:47:34.102]  They condition us to accept any kind of form of security, no matter how invasive, and condition us to throw out our Bill of Rights.
[02:47:35.563 --> 02:47:36.183]  Then they win.
[02:47:36.684 --> 02:47:38.064]  And you can't have that.
[02:47:39.205 --> 02:47:40.385]  You have to make that choice.
[02:47:40.445 --> 02:47:44.247]  Is it a free society, or is it a state-controlled police society?
[02:47:44.867 --> 02:47:47.848]  And I believe this country is a free society.
[02:47:48.088 --> 02:47:51.910]  And you can still have security and be a free society, you just have to do it correctly.
[02:47:52.590 --> 02:48:18.904]  And, uh, in my own personal experiences, I mean, come on, I had a friend of mine who, you know, is an FBI agent in counterterrorism, and he has a conceal and carry permit, and he's walking through and he shows him the conceal and carry permit, and he says, I'm an FBI agent, it's okay, and so they let him go through, and then his bag goes through, and he has a small Swiss Army knife on his keychain in his bag, and then it goes through the x-ray, and they say, I'm sorry, sir, you can't have that Swiss Army knife, and he's kind of looking at them like,
[02:48:19.424 --> 02:48:20.385]  But I'm carrying a gun!
[02:48:20.405 --> 02:48:27.811]  I mean, it's just ludicrous what the things that they've set up, and it's the appearance of security.
[02:48:28.092 --> 02:48:28.452]  And it is.
[02:48:28.512 --> 02:48:35.398]  It's a conditioning to get us to accept the fact that, oh, our bodies belong to the government, and we have no rights over them whatsoever.
[02:48:36.345 --> 02:48:36.505]  For
[02:48:51.305 --> 02:48:54.046]  He went to the Super Bowl, got a genital pat down.
[02:48:54.066 --> 02:48:56.547]  I mean, there's nowhere to run or hide from this.
[02:48:57.107 --> 02:48:59.668]  TSA is now setting up checkpoints on highways, Ty.
[02:49:00.088 --> 02:49:04.109]  I just want to commend your father for his courage because he loves his privacy.
[02:49:04.189 --> 02:49:07.190]  As he said on my show, he was really going to retire three years ago.
[02:49:07.470 --> 02:49:09.130]  He wants to ride off into the sunset.
[02:49:09.490 --> 02:49:14.372]  He's doing this for everybody and for his country as a governor, as a veteran.
[02:49:14.592 --> 02:49:17.533]  I mean, can you speak to your, you know, I mean, the fact that they're...
[02:49:18.253 --> 02:49:20.074]  We're not publicity hounds.
[02:49:20.114 --> 02:49:21.694]  We don't do things for publicity.
[02:49:21.754 --> 02:49:26.035]  We do things because we feel that we have to stand up and they're morally right.
[02:49:26.915 --> 02:49:30.816]  And nothing about this is anything to do with publicity.
[02:49:31.896 --> 02:49:34.337]  My dad's always been that way through his whole life.
[02:49:34.377 --> 02:49:39.258]  If he sees something wrong, he speaks about it, whether for good or bad.
[02:49:39.598 --> 02:49:42.319]  If he believes it's wrong, he'll speak out about it.
[02:49:44.614 --> 02:49:46.395]  You know, I think that's important for us all to do.
[02:49:46.715 --> 02:49:50.378]  You know, and you have to keep up that constant vigilance.
[02:49:51.218 --> 02:49:56.881]  Well, talking to him on air and off, he just says, Alex, I want to ride off in the sunset, but I can't stand this tyranny.
[02:49:56.921 --> 02:50:03.045]  So he says, I do six, eight months here fighting it, but then I just got to get away from it and just walk on the beach.
[02:50:03.225 --> 02:50:04.586]  I mean, and I don't blame him.
[02:50:04.666 --> 02:50:07.068]  I mean, I'm not 60 years old like he is.
[02:50:07.128 --> 02:50:11.190]  And every day, Ty, my instinct says, get out of here, get out of here.
[02:50:11.370 --> 02:50:12.311]  But there's nowhere to run.
[02:50:13.052 --> 02:50:17.394]  Well, if you believe and you love your country and you want to change things, you have to stay and fight.
[02:50:18.235 --> 02:50:22.317]  And he will stay and fight until he physically can't anymore.
[02:50:22.357 --> 02:50:29.721]  And he will continue to speak out against tyranny and speak out against things of this nature until he finally can kind of hang up the hat and move on.
[02:50:29.761 --> 02:50:36.705]  And that's where I guess I'll probably have to pick up the mantle and continue speaking out for truth in the works that I do.
[02:50:37.385 --> 02:50:39.848]  And we all have to do that as a citizenry.
[02:50:40.048 --> 02:50:47.275]  And we need to follow leaders like him, and leaders like yourself, and other people like Ron Paul, and things like that.
[02:50:47.735 --> 02:50:51.599]  And don't get duped into believing that if you join an organization, that's enough.
[02:50:51.739 --> 02:50:54.862]  I mean, you gotta stay vigilant, you gotta educate people.
[02:50:54.882 --> 02:50:55.963]  We've all gotta be leaders.
[02:50:56.003 --> 02:50:56.824]  Ty, stay there.
[02:50:56.844 --> 02:50:58.186]  Powerful information.
[02:51:00.276 --> 02:51:03.557]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[02:51:04.377 --> 02:51:08.598]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[02:51:08.878 --> 02:51:14.799]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[02:51:15.019 --> 02:51:17.180]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[02:51:17.460 --> 02:51:23.421]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[02:51:23.561 --> 02:51:26.885]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[02:51:26.966 --> 02:51:28.668]  There is no other program of its kind.
[02:51:28.828 --> 02:51:30.891]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[02:51:31.031 --> 02:51:35.677]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.
[02:51:35.897 --> 02:51:36.518]  Guaranteed.
[02:51:36.718 --> 02:51:40.764]  Prevent wage garnishments, bank levies, and stop collection calls with our proven program.
[02:51:41.004 --> 02:51:49.006]  Call Zero Debt in 90 days now, 800-477-9256, and ask for free information from an expert who also completed our program.
[02:51:49.026 --> 02:51:49.746]  800-477-9256 or zerodetguarantee.com.
[02:51:49.766 --> 02:51:50.587]  800-477-9256 or zerodetguarantee.com.
[02:51:59.691 --> 02:52:00.812]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:52:00.852 --> 02:52:07.575]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:52:07.835 --> 02:52:10.136]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:52:10.396 --> 02:52:15.619]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:52:15.819 --> 02:52:18.620]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:52:18.760 --> 02:52:20.821]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:52:21.081 --> 02:52:27.044]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:52:27.365 --> 02:52:30.586]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:52:30.767 --> 02:52:36.310]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:52:36.570 --> 02:52:37.891]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:52:38.211 --> 02:52:39.391]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:52:39.532 --> 02:52:42.093]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:52:42.213 --> 02:52:43.634]  He explains everything you need to know.
[02:52:43.874 --> 02:52:46.676]  Most of us eat a blend of processed, man-made, and all-natural food.
[02:52:46.736 --> 02:52:50.219]  But the food you eat may not provide all the nutrition your body needs.
[02:52:50.239 --> 02:52:54.562]  We now know that liquid vitamin supplements are absorbed faster than pills.
[02:52:54.662 --> 02:52:56.083]  That's why you need...
[02:53:14.472 --> 02:53:15.353]  Sea Energy.
[02:53:15.633 --> 02:53:25.240]  From AffinitySeaEnergy.com, sea vegetation is known to be the richest source of organic minerals, and that's what you'll find in all-natural, great-tasting Sea Energy.

[02:54:28.902 --> 02:54:32.086]  You know, I forgot about all the phone callers holding a talk with Jim Tice.
[02:54:32.106 --> 02:54:44.900]  We'll go a little bit into the next hour with him, and then the retransmission starts, where I get into this rollout of the president now is going to be breaking into radio, TV, your cell phones, your online video games, and giving you fear-mongering messages.
[02:54:45.380 --> 02:54:47.963]  I mean, that is out of Brave New World, 1984.
[02:54:48.003 --> 02:54:48.384]  The running man.
[02:54:50.766 --> 02:54:53.287]  I mean, it's just off the charts insane.
[02:54:53.327 --> 02:55:03.273]  Let's take some calls here for Tyrell Venter, obviously the son of Jesse Venter and a great producer and director in his own right.
[02:55:03.373 --> 02:55:04.113]  Very talented.
[02:55:04.553 --> 02:55:05.754]  Believe me, I've seen him working.
[02:55:05.794 --> 02:55:07.014]  He's the heart of the operation.
[02:55:07.555 --> 02:55:09.516]  Let's talk to Julio in Illinois.
[02:55:09.536 --> 02:55:10.896]  Julio, thanks for holding them.
[02:55:10.957 --> 02:55:13.458]  Corey, Nick, Rick and Gary and Mike.
[02:55:13.498 --> 02:55:14.338]  That's all we've got time for.
[02:55:14.378 --> 02:55:15.459]  Real fast, Julio, go ahead.
[02:55:16.528 --> 02:55:21.916]  Alex, man, this is pretty crazy with Big Brother literally coming over our TV screens.
[02:55:21.976 --> 02:55:24.299]  I work at a radio station at my college.
[02:55:24.700 --> 02:55:31.049]  We have EAS systems there that we have to call practically every hour just to get power readings.
[02:55:31.089 --> 02:55:31.850]  That's what they tell us.
[02:55:32.591 --> 02:55:37.738]  Just to see if the EAS system is working.
[02:55:37.938 --> 02:55:38.619]  And here's the deal.
[02:55:38.759 --> 02:55:41.283]  A decade ago they weren't all freaked out telling you to check it.
[02:55:41.523 --> 02:55:45.489]  Now they're getting you trained to run over to the government takeover box and just worship it.
[02:55:45.729 --> 02:55:46.790]  You know, it's your master.
[02:55:47.151 --> 02:55:47.712]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:55:48.675 --> 02:55:56.196]  Right, and they, you know, they tell us, like, one time our plug came out and the station was shut down for, like, maybe 20 minutes, and they got freaked out about it.
[02:55:56.236 --> 02:56:01.978]  But quickly, Alex, you talked about FEMA trying, you know, and the President wanting to talk to us during national emergencies.
[02:56:02.318 --> 02:56:11.659]  There's a big exercise coming up in May in a whole bunch of FEMA regions, including FEMA Region 5 in Illinois, NLE 11, getting prepared for earthquakes.
[02:56:11.719 --> 02:56:13.700]  And you have FEMA here January 20th.
[02:56:15.280 --> 02:56:18.682]  Buying, loading up on hydrated beverages.
[02:56:19.042 --> 02:56:19.863]  I hear you, Julio.
[02:56:19.943 --> 02:56:24.005]  I gotta go, but I'm aware of the new NLE, National Level Exercise.
[02:56:24.526 --> 02:56:26.287]  You cover that in the Police State episode.
[02:56:26.687 --> 02:56:31.210]  I think that's what shocked your dad the most, is these ten governors that the states aren't in control.
[02:56:32.202 --> 02:56:44.412]  Yeah, no, it is pretty frightening when you look at it, because it's like, you know, these people are, yeah, we elect the governors, but we didn't elect them to run ten regions of the country, you know, and that should be something debated on in Congress.
[02:56:44.452 --> 02:56:58.984]  That should be a big deal, and instead it just kind of slides through and, you know, this all started, you know, the post-9-11 push, and it's been ongoing for the last, you know, 50, 60 years in this country, I would say, you know, this push to turn us fascist, essentially.
[02:56:59.878 --> 02:57:01.379]  There's no doubt it's happening now.
[02:57:01.399 --> 02:57:03.920]  I mean, it doesn't matter who's in power.
[02:57:03.940 --> 02:57:05.500]  It could be Democrat or Republican.
[02:57:05.521 --> 02:57:07.942]  You know, they're all working for the same corporate masters.
[02:57:08.162 --> 02:57:12.564]  Let's jam in one more, then come back and take a few more with Ty on the other side going into the fourth hour.
[02:57:13.104 --> 02:57:14.324]  Let's talk to Cory in California.
[02:57:14.344 --> 02:57:15.425]  You've got about a minute and a half, Cory.
[02:57:16.266 --> 02:57:17.167]  Alright, thanks a lot, sir.
[02:57:17.227 --> 02:57:20.630]  Hey, um, I really agree with you, Mr. Ventura, on the stay and fight.
[02:57:20.710 --> 02:57:25.714]  I mean, we have to not be scared and, you know, voice our, uh, you know, the facts and opinions and things of that nature.
[02:57:25.734 --> 02:57:29.637]  Um, one question, um, I know you had a lot of questions about Season 30.
[02:57:29.737 --> 02:57:34.141]  Um, are there any, like, possible considerations on follow-ups on the previous series?
[02:57:34.181 --> 02:57:39.405]  Like, say, for example, the BP oil spill going back down there and just looking at, you know, the devastation that's been wrought there?
[02:57:40.507 --> 02:57:55.714]  Oh yeah, we would love, I mean, you know, in the first two seasons we didn't really focus on maybe going back to previous conspiracies that we've covered, but we would love to do that, you know, especially with BP or especially even with the police state or the water conspiracy, you know.
[02:57:55.794 --> 02:57:59.455]  We always keep tabs after we air a show, we always keep tabs on that.
[02:57:59.736 --> 02:58:02.897]  The problem is there's so many new things that haven't been covered, though.
[02:58:03.277 --> 02:58:15.120]  Yeah, I mean, hopefully if we can get to like four or five seasons, or maybe even the third season, if we can get that long of a show, and long of a run of a show, we definitely would love to go back and revisit some stuff.
[02:58:15.140 --> 02:58:15.680]  Oh!
[02:58:15.700 --> 02:58:16.240]  I've got an idea!
[02:58:16.260 --> 02:58:18.440]  We can only get the tip of the iceberg on some of these things.
[02:58:18.640 --> 02:58:18.920]  Yes!
[02:58:19.400 --> 02:58:26.062]  How about folks call True TV and email them and write them and say, put the show out on DVD so people can get it and share it.
[02:58:26.102 --> 02:58:26.902]  That's a good idea.
[02:58:27.142 --> 02:58:28.602]  These will be on DVD, Ty.
[02:58:29.003 --> 02:58:30.763]  Definitely, definitely, I agree, I agree.
[02:58:31.462 --> 02:58:32.102]  Alright, stay there.
[02:58:32.142 --> 02:58:35.424]  Back in one minute, a few final calls with Tyrell Ventura.
[02:58:35.765 --> 02:58:36.605]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:58:36.825 --> 02:58:39.106]  Get that Google search term out on the Obama takeover.
[02:58:42.488 --> 02:58:44.410]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:45.890 --> 02:58:48.132]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:50.330 --> 02:58:53.632]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[02:58:53.912 --> 02:58:54.973]  It ended on June of 2009.
[02:58:55.033 --> 02:58:59.396]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[02:58:59.596 --> 02:59:05.260]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[02:59:05.540 --> 02:59:07.521]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[02:59:07.701 --> 02:59:10.443]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[02:59:10.743 --> 02:59:17.048]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[02:59:17.228 --> 02:59:19.029]  They both make fabulous investments.
[02:59:19.429 --> 02:59:24.511]  Food is our greatest dependency and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[02:59:24.771 --> 02:59:29.752]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis and you can't eat paper, stocks or metals.
[02:59:30.052 --> 02:59:35.234]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[02:59:35.414 --> 02:59:38.375]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[02:59:38.615 --> 02:59:41.556]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[02:59:41.616 --> 02:59:42.616]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[02:59:50.751 --> 02:59:53.618]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:54.359 --> 02:59:57.546]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:03.542 --> 03:00:06.203]  Okay, we're doing a few more minutes with Tyrell Ventura.
[03:00:06.864 --> 03:00:08.044]  Again, contact TruTV.
[03:00:08.064 --> 03:00:09.605]  Tell them, put it out on DVD.
[03:00:09.965 --> 03:00:10.966]  The last two seasons.
[03:00:11.026 --> 03:00:11.946]  Guarantee people want it.
[03:00:12.607 --> 03:00:13.507]  Do a third season.
[03:00:13.527 --> 03:00:14.308]  It's so important.
[03:00:14.608 --> 03:00:15.988]  We appreciate listeners doing that in the past.
[03:00:16.309 --> 03:00:17.329]  Ty, we were just talking.
[03:00:17.609 --> 03:00:20.011]  You guys are really pushing for that Kim Trayl special.
[03:00:20.351 --> 03:00:22.432]  I know you guys would knock it out of the park.
[03:00:23.286 --> 03:00:23.987]  Oh for sure, yeah.
[03:00:24.027 --> 03:00:27.769]  We really want to do a Chemtrail episode this upcoming season.
[03:00:28.149 --> 03:00:29.970]  We've gotten a lot of viewer mail about it.
[03:00:30.030 --> 03:00:31.892]  It's one of the hottest ones we have yet to hit.
[03:00:32.792 --> 03:00:34.613]  So we definitely have that in our sights.
[03:00:34.633 --> 03:00:37.695]  Hopefully we'll be able to do it this next year.
[03:00:37.715 --> 03:00:42.879]  Like I said, first we've got to get another season, so let TruTV know.
[03:00:43.219 --> 03:00:44.580]  But yeah, Chemtrail is a big one.
[03:00:44.620 --> 03:00:46.001]  Morgallon is the whole thing.
[03:00:47.542 --> 03:00:49.223]  Let's go ahead and talk to Rick in Florida.
[03:00:49.243 --> 03:00:50.784]  You're on the air with Tyrell Ventura.
[03:00:51.974 --> 03:00:53.575]  Good afternoon, Alex and Tyrell.
[03:00:53.595 --> 03:00:54.175]  What an honor.
[03:00:54.395 --> 03:00:55.735]  Alex, you just stole my thunder!
[03:00:55.775 --> 03:00:58.416]  That's what I called to ask him about, is the chemtrails.
[03:00:59.377 --> 03:01:01.097]  So, I'm just gonna say I really love you guys.
[03:01:01.117 --> 03:01:02.057]  Keep up the hard work.
[03:01:02.358 --> 03:01:08.320]  Is there any chance that another cable TV network would pick up the show if TruTV decided to drop it?
[03:01:08.440 --> 03:01:12.201]  Well, they'd have to change the name, but yeah, Ventura could do another show, couldn't he?
[03:01:12.990 --> 03:01:15.011]  Yeah, he could do another show, I guess.
[03:01:15.071 --> 03:01:19.212]  But, you know, right now, TruTV has not given us any indication that they want to drop it.
[03:01:19.252 --> 03:01:22.073]  They've been super supportive and we've really enjoyed working with them.
[03:01:22.173 --> 03:01:25.615]  So, as of right now, I mean, we're very happy with where we're at.
[03:01:25.735 --> 03:01:29.216]  And, you know, I wouldn't venture to even talk about it.
[03:01:29.436 --> 03:01:31.457]  I love working with TruTV.
[03:01:31.537 --> 03:01:32.077]  They've been great.
[03:01:32.217 --> 03:01:32.637]  Good question.
[03:01:33.018 --> 03:01:34.078]  Yeah, they were the first to do it.
[03:01:34.098 --> 03:01:37.459]  The problem is, old Homeland Security's got the kill switch.
[03:01:37.519 --> 03:01:40.060]  Mr. Cohen's the new national TV programmer.
[03:01:40.780 --> 03:01:43.300]  Let's go ahead and talk to Gary in Illinois.
[03:01:43.320 --> 03:01:44.641]  You're on the air with Tyrell.
[03:01:45.801 --> 03:01:46.821]  Hi, Tyrell.
[03:01:46.921 --> 03:01:47.801]  Great show.
[03:01:48.041 --> 03:01:50.922]  Unbelievable that the series got out there, and I'm glad it did.
[03:01:50.942 --> 03:01:52.882]  It turned a lot of people into it.
[03:01:53.363 --> 03:01:54.783]  I got a few suggestions.
[03:01:56.095 --> 03:01:58.117]  So many conspiracies, so little time.
[03:01:58.457 --> 03:02:03.402]  Depleted Uranium, Fluoride, Vaccines, Codex Alimentarius?
[03:02:03.462 --> 03:02:05.684]  Oh yeah, all that stuff.
[03:02:05.764 --> 03:02:13.271]  Every year when we do a show, we put together about 30 to 40 different show topics and kind of whittle it down from there.
[03:02:13.891 --> 03:02:17.355]  We haven't gotten deep into depleted Uranium and that, but it's a great topic.
[03:02:17.975 --> 03:02:19.897]  Gulf War Syndrome is another one.
[03:02:20.257 --> 03:02:22.638]  I'm really impressed with the shows you guys have picked, though.
[03:02:22.658 --> 03:02:27.341]  I mean, you guys have really... And you end up coming to my conclusions separately from me.
[03:02:27.401 --> 03:02:29.162]  I mean, you guys really do some research.
[03:02:30.074 --> 03:02:37.476]  Oh, we have a great team of staff, and great producers, great APs, and great company, A. Smith Productions.
[03:02:38.516 --> 03:02:48.338]  We have a great support team doing this show, and we try to hit as many of the good ones as we can, and yes, some get left, but that's why we go for third seasons and fourth seasons and fifth seasons.
[03:02:48.779 --> 03:02:49.459]  Gary, thanks.
[03:02:49.499 --> 03:02:50.019]  Good point.
[03:02:50.059 --> 03:02:51.399]  Last caller we have time for.
[03:02:52.079 --> 03:02:54.220]  Mike in Jersey, you're on the air with Ty.
[03:02:54.280 --> 03:02:54.620]  Go ahead.
[03:02:56.041 --> 03:03:00.972]  Yes, through the providence of God, as a matter of fact, I say hello to all the free, sovereign people of America.
[03:03:01.392 --> 03:03:05.301]  A lawful government has been re-established in this country, taking control back.
[03:03:06.073 --> 03:03:13.354]  Yeah, I appreciate your call.
[03:03:13.594 --> 03:03:19.996]  You know, I see all these different organizations claiming that they've set up a group and everything's going to be fixed and then it never happens.
[03:03:20.296 --> 03:03:29.677]  We've got to individually, physically take our nation back by getting good people elected, kick the EAS FEMA takeover systems out, sue the TSA, boycott.
[03:03:30.137 --> 03:03:32.638]  All of us doing little things are going to overturn this system.
[03:03:33.078 --> 03:03:38.321]  Again, and I'm not trying to poo-poo everything you brought up, but I just see all these groups and radio hosts and things I've seen.
[03:03:38.641 --> 03:03:42.083]  You know, oh, we're filing with the government, it's all over, the tyranny's over.
[03:03:42.564 --> 03:03:43.784]  And that's just not the case.
[03:03:43.824 --> 03:03:45.505]  These globalists are dug in.
[03:03:45.865 --> 03:03:47.927]  Ty, final comments on all of us.
[03:03:48.127 --> 03:03:49.948]  You know, your dad's down there fighting in Mexico.
[03:03:50.208 --> 03:03:51.249]  He's got a new book coming out.
[03:03:51.289 --> 03:03:53.410]  He's going to be on our show in early April.
[03:03:53.710 --> 03:03:55.031]  He's launching a new book.
[03:03:55.451 --> 03:03:55.931]  What's the name?
[03:03:56.291 --> 03:03:58.453]  The 63 Documents the Government Doesn't Want You to See?
[03:03:59.249 --> 03:04:08.272]  Yeah, that is correct, and that'll be coming out in April, and it's going to be another great read and good book, and it'll be fun.
[03:04:08.652 --> 03:04:17.734]  We'll keep our vigilance and we'll keep our truth-telling as long as we can do it and as long as we have an airway and a capacity to do it, and we all have to do the same thing.
[03:04:17.754 --> 03:04:21.555]  Everyone needs to keep banding together, and hey, the little things count.
[03:04:21.595 --> 03:04:25.717]  If you want to change government, focus on your local elections and start there, and then work up.
