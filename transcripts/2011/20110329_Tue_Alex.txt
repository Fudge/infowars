[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:05.940]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.621 --> 00:00:07.662]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.382 --> 00:00:09.523]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.143 --> 00:00:10.964]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:12.705]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:16.888]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.469 --> 00:00:21.592]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.598 --> 00:00:35.041]  Welcome, my friends, welcome and thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:35.061 --> 00:00:38.203]  It is Tuesday, the 29th day of March, 2011.
[00:00:39.304 --> 00:00:43.027]  We're going to be live here for at least the next three hours.
[00:00:43.107 --> 00:00:59.100]  Coming up in the next segment, we're going to have Nigel Farage, a member of the European Union Parliament, joining us, who has excoriated the head of the EU, Herman Van Rompuy, for just back in December, just three and a half months ago,
[00:01:00.327 --> 00:01:06.732]  Hanging out with Muammar Gaddafi and the fact that the West has armed Gaddafi.
[00:01:07.293 --> 00:01:09.274]  Obviously, we've seen Obama's speech.
[00:01:10.395 --> 00:01:16.900]  The media is hailing Obama and the administration as the ones that initiated the rebels, which is actually true.
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.762]  The rebels are Al Qaeda-led.
[00:01:20.823 --> 00:01:40.518]  Just like they used Al-Qaeda against the Serbs, just like they used Al-Qaeda against the Russians, just like they used Al-Qaeda against the American people so they could destroy the republic and try to take all of our liberties, stealing them away as fast as they can and converting our once free republic to this panoptagon police state.
[00:01:41.511 --> 00:01:44.312]  So that is all coming up after the break.
[00:01:45.253 --> 00:01:50.195]  Then when Nigel Farage leaves us at the bottom of the hour, I will shift into the biggest news.
[00:01:50.995 --> 00:01:58.519]  And I am, of course, proud of the fact that we had this out in the Western media first yesterday.
[00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:14.965]  at prison planet dot com meltdown plutonium found in soil and the water as well at fukushima as cover-up continues steve watson that was out at noon yesterday deadly radioactive water leaking into soil and the ocean
[00:02:15.805 --> 00:02:19.347]  It was in the Japanese news, but they hadn't made a big deal out of it yet.
[00:02:19.787 --> 00:02:27.751]  Well, now today AFP, Associated Press, Japan on maximum alert over nuclear plant.
[00:02:28.331 --> 00:02:38.837]  Japan said today it is on maximum alert over a crippled nuclear plant where highly radioactive water, 100,000 times safe levels, has halted repair work.
[00:02:39.813 --> 00:02:52.304]  It's so deadly that if you spend five hours in there, you get 5,000 millisieverts, which the Washington Post reported will kill very quickly roughly half the people that come in contact with it.
[00:02:52.364 --> 00:03:00.551]  It's so radioactive that if you get around it for five hours, you've got a 50-50 chance of it killing you in just a few days or weeks.
[00:03:01.252 --> 00:03:03.613]  And obviously those that survive are going to have big problems.
[00:03:04.734 --> 00:03:07.035]  So they've had to halt repair work there.
[00:03:07.075 --> 00:03:13.818]  You've got four, excuse me, five of the six reactors that have either exploded or been on fire or are still smoking.
[00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:17.020]  And this is pretty much out of the news now.
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.181]  You see some reportage on it, but it's like, oh, that's in Japan.
[00:03:20.221 --> 00:03:21.122]  What are we worried about?
[00:03:21.502 --> 00:03:29.426]  We have these reactors built by the same people, General Electric, 23 of the exact same MOX Mark I reactors.
[00:03:30.086 --> 00:03:41.609]  Alone, the earthquake and tsunami that ravaged Japan's northeast coast, left around 28,000 dead or missing, also knocked out reactor cooling systems at the Fukushima plant, which has leaked radiation into the air and sea.
[00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:52.972]  The Prime Minister conceded the situation at the Coastal Atomic Power Station remained unpredictable and pledged his government would tackle the problem while in a state of maximum alert.
[00:03:53.752 --> 00:03:54.913]  Maximum alert.
[00:03:54.973 --> 00:03:57.996]  So they're in maximum crisis right now.
[00:03:58.477 --> 00:04:01.780]  And a stopgap measure contained the crisis at the plant, which they haven't contained.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:08.125]  Crews have poured thousands of tons of water on the reactors where fuel rods are thought to have partially melted.
[00:04:08.165 --> 00:04:09.146]  That happened two weeks ago.
[00:04:09.727 --> 00:04:13.050]  And topped up pools of spent fuel rods.
[00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:20.157]  But the runoff of the operation has accumulated in the basements of the turbine rooms connected to three reactors and filled up tunnels
[00:04:20.777 --> 00:04:25.379]  Making it too risky for workers to go near the repair cooling systems needed to stabilize the plant.
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.440]  You saw all those giant explosions.
[00:04:28.161 --> 00:04:30.962]  We told you a week and a half ago when they were trying to get power back in there.
[00:04:31.423 --> 00:04:33.704]  You saw those huge mushroom clouds and explosions.
[00:04:34.878 --> 00:04:38.380]  Fox News is still rolling footage of the plant before it ever had a problem.
[00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:39.401]  Like, oh look, it's happy.
[00:04:39.461 --> 00:04:40.782]  Birds are tweeting and singing.
[00:04:41.262 --> 00:04:46.785]  The place is a complete disaster zone with hundreds of thousands of spent fuel rods thrown all over the place.
[00:04:47.866 --> 00:04:51.028]  Radioactive plutonium-laced water and uranium-laced water.
[00:04:51.528 --> 00:04:55.350]  A bunch of other isotopes running into the ocean and the aquifer under it.
[00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.292]  It's just absolute bedlam.
[00:04:58.112 --> 00:04:59.373]  We'll go to Libya when we come back.
[00:05:00.455 --> 00:05:04.678]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:05:04.998 --> 00:05:05.278]  Number 1.
[00:05:05.918 --> 00:05:09.060]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:05:09.341 --> 00:05:09.901]  Number 2.
[00:05:10.201 --> 00:05:14.744]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:05:15.084 --> 00:05:15.545]  It's true.
[00:05:15.845 --> 00:05:20.388]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:05:20.708 --> 00:05:21.248]  Number 3.
[00:05:21.528 --> 00:05:24.810]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:05:25.111 --> 00:05:28.813]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:05:29.013 --> 00:05:29.574]  Number 4.
[00:05:29.814 --> 00:05:32.177]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:05:32.577 --> 00:05:35.961]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:05:36.261 --> 00:05:36.481]  Number 5.
[00:05:37.042 --> 00:05:40.966]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:05:41.207 --> 00:05:45.972]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:06:52.441 --> 00:06:52.942]  Thank you!
[00:07:01.235 --> 00:07:04.879]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:08.263]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:07:08.503 --> 00:07:13.288]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:07:13.308 --> 00:07:19.575]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:07:19.695 --> 00:07:21.938]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:07:22.478 --> 00:07:22.758]  Tim Geithner?
[00:07:22.778 --> 00:07:23.198]  Bernanke?
[00:07:23.278 --> 00:07:23.919]  They're arsonists!
[00:07:23.959 --> 00:07:25.219]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:07:25.239 --> 00:07:27.480]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:07:41.365 --> 00:07:45.286]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[00:07:45.747 --> 00:07:48.307]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:07:48.647 --> 00:07:57.751]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.011]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.632 --> 00:08:11.617]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:13.908 --> 00:08:22.931]  Japan has now announced via their Prime Minister maximum alert uranium, plutonium getting in to the groundwater supply.
[00:08:22.951 --> 00:08:25.311]  100,000 times safe levels.
[00:08:27.012 --> 00:08:28.172]  1,000 millisieverts an hour.
[00:08:28.312 --> 00:08:36.795]  Five hours of that, the Washington Post radiologist expert reported, will roughly kill half the people within just a few weeks that come in contact with it.
[00:08:37.635 --> 00:08:52.643]  Just amazing information that's coming up at the end of our interview with Nigel Farage, a British politician, former leader of the UK Independence Party, current member of the European Union Parliament from South East England.
[00:08:53.223 --> 00:08:57.606]  UKIP.org is the UK Independence Party website.
[00:08:57.646 --> 00:09:03.409]  It's kind of like the Ron Paul version of the anti-New World Order crowd over in England.
[00:09:04.289 --> 00:09:16.652]  Folks, Nigel Farage, I noticed last week, excoriated Herman Van Rompuy, we're going to play a clip of that coming up, the head of the EU, for, back in December, holding hands and hugging on Muammar Gaddafi.
[00:09:16.692 --> 00:09:27.194]  And we've seen countless other European and American politicians over there saying he was our gallant little ally the last six years, after former British Prime Minister at the time, Tony Blair, made deals with him.
[00:09:27.554 --> 00:09:33.375]  It's now in the London Telegraph, Associated Press, New York Times, that yes, the main contingent attacking Gaddafi from the East
[00:09:33.895 --> 00:09:57.829]  is al-qaeda but it's the good al-qaeda we're told and if you're not for al-qaeda now you're anti-freedom uh... so just absolutely amazing and to break this down from the european union perspective on the heels of barack obama's speech at the washington post hailing obama for basically quietly initiating the rebels and giving them the green light british s a s on the ground we now learn for over
[00:09:58.569 --> 00:09:58.969]  A month.
[00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:03.632]  It is confirmed 2,200 Marines preparing to ground invade.
[00:10:03.692 --> 00:10:06.173]  But it's not a war, it's kinetic military action.
[00:10:06.513 --> 00:10:10.095]  And if it's a ground invasion, it's part of a humanitarian assistance.
[00:10:10.175 --> 00:10:13.537]  So, this is not a war, Nigel Farage, is it?
[00:10:14.059 --> 00:10:15.340]  I'm afraid it could well be a war.
[00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:17.021]  You know, we've started something here.
[00:10:17.762 --> 00:10:19.083]  We've no idea where it's going to end.
[00:10:19.323 --> 00:10:21.745]  I mean, this idea that Gaddafi's a bad man.
[00:10:21.985 --> 00:10:24.568]  Look, Gaddafi's been a bad man for 42 years.
[00:10:25.188 --> 00:10:37.118]  But as you quite rightly say, six years ago, Mr Blair went and hugged him, and Mr Berlusconi's been to meet him as well, and our British Commissioner in Europe, Peter Mandelson, went pheasant shooting with his son.
[00:10:37.478 --> 00:10:40.319]  I mean, we welcomed this guy in to the fold.
[00:10:40.919 --> 00:10:42.679]  We treated him as a friend and an ally.
[00:10:42.699 --> 00:10:51.241]  And as recently as December, the President of the European Union was there, you know, holding hands and being all matey with him.
[00:10:51.261 --> 00:10:59.223]  And now we're being told, and Herman Van Rompuy and the British government and the French government are saying, this is all about regime change.
[00:10:59.363 --> 00:11:04.504]  We've got to get rid of Gaddafi and we are actively, militarily supporting the rebels.
[00:11:05.144 --> 00:11:10.366]  Without having had a clue from the start who the rebels are, or what their motivations are.
[00:11:10.486 --> 00:11:17.909]  Now if this is for humanitarian reasons, who is to say that if the rebels get to Tripoli, that they won't massacre Gaddafi's people?
[00:11:17.929 --> 00:11:29.253]  I mean, I just think we've got into something here, we haven't thought it through, it's not part of a bigger North African and Middle East strategy, and I seriously regret our actions so far.
[00:11:30.458 --> 00:11:38.551]  Well, it's confirmed that they lied and said through the British Foreign Ministry that he'd run to Venezuela to destabilize.
[00:11:39.112 --> 00:11:42.016]  It's confirmed that he didn't run to Zimbabwe.
[00:11:42.076 --> 00:11:44.220]  It's confirmed that
[00:11:45.922 --> 00:11:51.629]  That he was not strafing crowds of people, and they were actually armed groups.
[00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:53.552]  But we're not saying Gaddafi's a good guy.
[00:11:53.592 --> 00:12:03.745]  The point here is, we've been told a lot of lies, and as you pointed out, Mainline, even BBC, has admitted that the rebels in the East
[00:12:04.165 --> 00:12:04.265]  Yeah.
[00:12:04.285 --> 00:12:04.426]  Well...
[00:12:20.504 --> 00:12:26.771]  Well, you've got to remember that as far as the European Union's concerned, we are in very, very deep crisis over here.
[00:12:27.252 --> 00:12:33.279]  Already in the space of the last year, we've had to bail out Greece, whose presence in the Euro wasn't working.
[00:12:33.639 --> 00:12:35.001]  We've had to bail out the Irish.
[00:12:35.641 --> 00:12:36.462]  We're good to go.
[00:12:53.499 --> 00:13:04.603]  And I think it's been, all through the years, a marvellous thing for leaders, when they're in real trouble, and when public support is waning, to head off and have foreign military adventures.
[00:13:04.643 --> 00:13:15.586]  And so I do see this, as much as anything else, as a diversionary tactic, as an attempt to whip up jingoistic support for our boys going into Libya and doing the right thing.
[00:13:16.067 --> 00:13:19.728]  And initially, they appeared to have got away with it.
[00:13:19.848 --> 00:13:22.729]  I suspect, as you say, because they were telling us a pack of lies,
[00:13:23.689 --> 00:13:36.898]  So much so, when the British Parliament, when the House of Commons had a vote on this, only 13 MPs out of 650 voted against military action.
[00:13:37.438 --> 00:13:43.001]  Such was that sort of Lemming-like support amongst our politicians for this enterprise.
[00:13:43.822 --> 00:13:46.984]  But I suspect that now, today's report, that there is
[00:13:47.604 --> 00:13:50.385]  A presence of Al Qaeda amongst the rebels.
[00:13:50.685 --> 00:13:56.567]  The reports that actually, you know, both sides have committed atrocities and they will probably get worse as time goes on.
[00:13:57.047 --> 00:14:09.650]  I think that politicians that have launched us into this, thinking that it'll increase their popularity, if we're going to send in ground troops as well, who's to say we're not getting ourselves into yet another Afghanistan?
[00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:12.931]  And I think politically this decision will backfire very badly on them.
[00:14:14.005 --> 00:14:27.173]  Well, I agree with you, but now we have Senator Lieberman and others saying this sets a precedent that anytime people rebel in a country, whether it's a good country, bad, whatever, that now the U.N.
[00:14:27.573 --> 00:14:32.296]  will pass a resolution and in less than 48 hours, the U.S.
[00:14:32.336 --> 00:14:40.040]  military was firing cruise missiles, NATO members were dropping bombs, England and France and others.
[00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:42.722]  I mean, this is incredible that our Congress
[00:14:43.542 --> 00:14:46.026]  I mean, at least in England, you guys had a vote on it.
[00:14:47.128 --> 00:14:57.303]  Our Congress... I know the UK Independence Party is always talking about how 70 plus percent of the laws that govern England now, you don't even get to vote on in the British Parliament.
[00:14:57.643 --> 00:14:58.204]  Well, here...
[00:14:59.085 --> 00:15:13.432]  Obama didn't even consult Congress when the law says they've got to give a declaration of war or at least an authorization of force and our own Congress barely even bat an eye at becoming vestigial or ceremonial.
[00:15:14.005 --> 00:15:19.729]  Well, I mean, you know, you are being very badly let down, aren't you, by your congressmen.
[00:15:19.789 --> 00:15:22.071]  I mean, they should be standing up and screaming and shouting.
[00:15:23.052 --> 00:15:25.613]  Their job is to represent people.
[00:15:25.954 --> 00:15:27.955]  Their job is to represent the democratic will.
[00:15:28.015 --> 00:15:31.438]  Their job is to have a check and a balance on the executive.
[00:15:31.838 --> 00:15:37.102]  And they're clearly, in America right at the moment, totally failing in their duty.
[00:15:37.442 --> 00:15:42.646]  And you know, this idea that we've got to support rebellions, wherever they may be,
[00:15:43.186 --> 00:15:52.569]  Is anybody seriously suggesting that if there's a major uprising in Saudi Arabia, and the Saudis shoot a couple of hundred, that we're going to start bombing Saudi Arabia?
[00:15:52.809 --> 00:16:00.231]  I mean, are we about to launch our own version of jihad against every regime, every Arab state?
[00:16:00.291 --> 00:16:02.691]  I mean, it's absolutely insane.
[00:16:05.183 --> 00:16:12.727]  I cannot for the life of me, I mean, we've been in Afghanistan for over 10 years, there is no end in sight whatsoever.
[00:16:13.247 --> 00:16:23.533]  I cannot believe that public opinion will put up in Britain, America or France with us getting involved in a whole series of military conflicts across the Middle East.
[00:16:23.613 --> 00:16:25.534]  I think the whole thing is absolutely crazy.
[00:16:25.754 --> 00:16:35.308]  Well, you're pointing out how just wild and out of control this is, this new military adventurism, but it's being hailed all over the European papers, U.S.
[00:16:35.348 --> 00:16:40.636]  papers, British papers, as the new world order, that this is the new cover
[00:16:41.317 --> 00:16:58.281]  For, I guess, globalist imperialism, is that they quietly finance rebellions, they use Al-Qaeda, they tell us Al-Qaeda's now good, right out of 1984, and now they're saying, yes, rise up against your government, and we'll do a no-fly zone.
[00:16:58.501 --> 00:17:06.103]  They're openly debating in our news, all over the news channels, how we need to go ahead and attack Syria.
[00:17:06.423 --> 00:17:10.804]  I mean, this is starting to look like the makings of a bigger than a regional war,
[00:17:11.324 --> 00:17:14.687]  This looks like how World War I or World War II started.
[00:17:15.027 --> 00:17:18.209]  Well, yeah, you know, it's odd, isn't it?
[00:17:18.249 --> 00:17:20.551]  You never quite know what will catalyze a bigger conflict.
[00:17:20.871 --> 00:17:32.800]  What I do know is that, you know, when World War I started and World War II started, the massive populations in the countries supported the basic aims of the war, alright?
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:52.612]  Now the point about this is, whatever the media are saying, whatever the mainstream media are saying, whatever our politicians in Westminster are voting for, however much your congressmen bury their own heads in the sand, you know, I've seen, I mean there was an opinion poll out in Britain this morning that showed 7 out of 10 Britons are very worried about the Libyan adventure.
[00:17:52.932 --> 00:17:53.472]  I don't know.
[00:18:13.463 --> 00:18:24.316]  What we're going to see are rebellions of our own in our own countries and people will take to the streets and say, we do not wish to get embroiled in regional or possibly even global conflict.
[00:18:24.336 --> 00:18:30.964]  Well that's my next point, Member of European Union Parliament Nigel Farage, former leader of the UK Independence Party in England.
[00:18:32.606 --> 00:18:35.047]  Look, we have 30 million illegal aliens in this country.
[00:18:35.228 --> 00:18:45.493]  The Marxist Ford Foundation universities do teach the Southwest, bought from Mexico, from Texas, California, is owned by Mexico.
[00:18:45.893 --> 00:18:47.454]  There are open calls for rebellion.
[00:18:47.474 --> 00:18:52.157]  I know there's giant immigrant populations in Europe that routinely burn large areas of the ground.
[00:18:52.737 --> 00:18:54.579]  What would happen under this new U.N.
[00:18:54.619 --> 00:18:58.441]  precedent if they rose up and began burning cities?
[00:18:59.022 --> 00:19:05.887]  Would we then see the Russians or the Chinese under the U.N., who are members, come here into a no-fly zone and attack us?
[00:19:06.487 --> 00:19:10.811]  Now obviously that's absurd, but that's the precedent that's being set here.
[00:19:11.551 --> 00:19:12.632]  Yeah, I think that's right.
[00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:18.573]  We have some very large Muslim populations in European countries.
[00:19:19.213 --> 00:19:25.077]  Mercifully, the vast majority of them are absolutely peaceful and democratic, but we have got some very dangerous minorities.
[00:19:25.878 --> 00:19:33.083]  My feeling is that by going to war in the Middle East, all we are likely to do is to give the extremists an excuse
[00:19:34.105 --> 00:19:37.548]  And so you could see two types of demonstration going on in these countries.
[00:19:38.029 --> 00:19:43.573]  Firstly, you could see, as you say, Muslim extremists, you know, getting back.
[00:19:43.653 --> 00:19:51.240]  And we shouldn't forget that the last time we bombed the kernel, back in the mid-80s, it wasn't very long before a 747 landed on the village of Lockerbie.
[00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:52.061]  Tell you what, stay there.
[00:19:52.161 --> 00:19:52.821]  Final segment.
[00:19:52.841 --> 00:19:54.363]  Nigel Farage back in just a few minutes.
[00:19:54.683 --> 00:19:55.924]  That's the next point I want to cover.
[00:19:55.944 --> 00:19:58.586]  The media's saying, oh, Gaddafi may attack us.
[00:19:58.906 --> 00:20:00.368]  Then they'll use that to take more of our liberties.
[00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:06.186]  Freedom, the blistering anti-globalist anthem from the rock band Ravelin.
[00:20:19.349 --> 00:20:22.892]  Just one of 11 great songs from the album Under the Sun.
[00:20:23.112 --> 00:20:25.694]  Available on iTunes and at Ravelyn.com.

[00:20:31.018 --> 00:20:33.140]  Spring and a new growing season are here.
[00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:37.143]  Plant a healthy garden easy and fast with OrganicaSeed.com.
[00:20:37.503 --> 00:20:47.829]  Easy, because OrganicaSeed.com offers one of the largest online selections of organic, heirloom, non-hybrid, and untreated seeds, as well as tobacco and cotton seeds, at low prices.
[00:20:48.069 --> 00:20:49.870]  Go to OrganicaSeed.com.

[00:20:56.513 --> 00:20:59.335]  Remember, OrganicaSeed is healthy seed.
[00:21:00.743 --> 00:21:02.284]  America, you've been warned.
[00:21:02.684 --> 00:21:09.547]  For weeks, we've been warning you about a single event we believe will happen in the next 12 months that will shake the very foundations of our nation.
[00:21:09.727 --> 00:21:12.769]  We've told you about the video that details this shocking prediction.
[00:21:13.109 --> 00:21:16.551]  So far, over 6 million people have watched this free video online.
[00:21:16.771 --> 00:21:17.231]  Have you?
[00:21:17.591 --> 00:21:25.995]  Again, this big event has nothing to do with war or the stock market, yet it could change everything about your normal way of life, the way you shop, travel, invest, educate
[00:21:26.075 --> 00:21:26.395]  We're good.
[00:21:41.032 --> 00:21:41.332]  I don't know.
[00:22:00.765 --> 00:22:02.667]  Peter Krashnobyl from Midas Resources.
[00:22:02.727 --> 00:22:03.548]  Today is March 29th, 2011.
[00:22:03.608 --> 00:22:04.609]  Gold opened this morning at $14.1720.
[00:22:04.669 --> 00:22:07.972]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $14.5370, $7.2685 for a half ounce, and $3.6343 for a quarter ounce.
[00:22:07.992 --> 00:22:07.972]  $14.5370, $7.2685, $3.6343.
[00:22:21.204 --> 00:22:24.188]  The Constitution and the Bill of Rights have been reduced to old relics.
[00:22:24.268 --> 00:22:28.092]  Politicians ignore, trample with their outlandish, overreaching policies.
[00:22:28.212 --> 00:22:32.177]  Your support of the Campaign for Liberty stands in the way of this insidious process.
[00:22:32.417 --> 00:22:33.538]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:33.558 --> 00:22:35.901]  I've teamed up with the Campaign for Liberty to offer the
[00:22:36.161 --> 00:22:36.501]  Thank you.

[00:23:29.798 --> 00:23:39.064]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:23:39.104 --> 00:23:39.845]  This capitalism?
[00:23:39.905 --> 00:23:46.049]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:23:46.189 --> 00:23:46.990]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:50.152]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[00:23:50.312 --> 00:23:51.112]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[00:23:51.132 --> 00:23:52.633]  It's time to understand the system.
[00:23:52.653 --> 00:23:52.793]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:23:52.833 --> 00:23:53.114]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:08.443]  Okay, we've only got five minutes left with the UK member of the EU Parliament, Nigel Farage.
[00:24:08.924 --> 00:24:13.206]  By the way, the Liberty Movement, I was just talking to him during the break, is exploding all over Europe, and not just England.
[00:24:13.226 --> 00:24:14.927]  Their party is expanding.
[00:24:15.808 --> 00:24:19.670]  Back on May 6th of last year, a horrible, devastating plane crash.
[00:24:20.311 --> 00:24:21.571]  The pilot barely survived.
[00:24:21.651 --> 00:24:24.713]  Nigel was torn up really bad, but he's back.
[00:24:25.914 --> 00:24:27.495]  I tell you, talk about stiff upper lip.
[00:24:28.135 --> 00:24:38.979]  Nigel, finishing up with the terror card, they've said, yes, we're bombarding Qaddafi and blowing up infrastructure, and if he fights back in any way, it's terrorism.
[00:24:39.539 --> 00:24:45.002]  And they're talking about that legitimizing a ground invasion if there's any type of terror attack.
[00:24:45.722 --> 00:24:49.984]  I wonder if some groups might allow crazies to do something or might open the door.
[00:24:50.224 --> 00:24:50.604]  Who knows?
[00:24:51.044 --> 00:24:53.905]  Well, they do seem to be very keen to put in ground troops, don't they?
[00:24:54.265 --> 00:24:54.505]  Yes.
[00:24:54.645 --> 00:24:58.286]  I mean, we've already had the SAS there for some time, that we know for a fact.
[00:24:58.726 --> 00:25:00.747]  We've got the British Royal Marines getting ready to go.
[00:25:01.447 --> 00:25:02.787]  You've got a corps getting ready to go.
[00:25:02.867 --> 00:25:07.129]  It's almost as if our governments are looking for an excuse to put in ground troops.
[00:25:07.309 --> 00:25:15.951]  And I think, you know, I really feel that we have got to put pressure on our politicians, real pressure on our politicians.
[00:25:16.331 --> 00:25:18.472]  And I think if any prospect
[00:25:19.092 --> 00:25:24.713]  Of some major escalation of us getting involved in a huge, huge conflict across the Middle East.
[00:25:25.374 --> 00:25:26.414]  We've got to take to the streets.
[00:25:26.934 --> 00:25:28.694]  We've got to take to the streets, millions of us.
[00:25:29.134 --> 00:25:36.376]  And we've got to march and we've got to say, not in my name, we do not give consent for endless war and endless conflict.
[00:25:36.716 --> 00:25:48.079]  Especially because, whether it's Al-Qaeda and the rebels or Gaddafi, they may both be as bad as each other and clearly it's not in our national interest to get involved in these conflicts.
[00:25:48.885 --> 00:25:58.168]  Well, we're now hearing from Obama and others that this is a great moment for globalism, for the New World Order, where the UN gives the orders and our militaries go in.
[00:25:58.188 --> 00:26:04.450]  I mean, is this not more of this expansion of undemocratic power, similar to how the EU runs England?
[00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:09.511]  Yes, it is a classic case of what we call the beneficial crisis.
[00:26:10.231 --> 00:26:22.274]  Whenever there's a crisis, it's used by big government, it's used by supranational global government as an excuse to say, look, we're doing the right thing and to take more powers and to further rob us of our democracy.
[00:26:22.534 --> 00:26:27.376]  This, perhaps what is happening now, looks like the most extreme example of it that we've had to date.
[00:26:27.736 --> 00:26:28.636]  And we've got to resist.
[00:26:29.317 --> 00:26:37.259]  As I said earlier, we've got to take to the streets, we've got to withdraw our democratic consent from politicians who are not prepared to stand up and fight this.
[00:26:38.217 --> 00:26:49.785]  Well notice a few weeks ago Obama didn't even want to give a speech or comment on Libya and they reported that he had to give this speech last night and it was quote a hard sell because people aren't for it.
[00:26:50.085 --> 00:26:59.731]  Then I saw a Reuters poll claiming that 60 plus percent supported it but then I read the poll it just asked you know what option you thought they should use in war.
[00:26:59.871 --> 00:27:02.393]  It didn't even let people have a decision to say no.
[00:27:02.853 --> 00:27:14.944]  Yeah, well as I say, overnight in Britain there's a poll out being conducted by one of our TV channels showing that 7 out of 10 people in Britain are deeply worried and want no further escalation.
[00:27:14.984 --> 00:27:19.028]  And I would reckon that's a pretty accurate opinion poll amongst ordinary people.
[00:27:19.428 --> 00:27:25.554]  Sadly, amongst our so-called mainstream media and politicians, that message hasn't yet got through.
[00:27:25.574 --> 00:27:26.535]  It's got to.
[00:27:26.835 --> 00:27:38.872]  Now Nigel, I want to put on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, for radio listeners, they can just search the term Herman Van Rompuy, Muammar Gaddafi, and they'll see the photos of the hugging and the shaking hands and the rest of it.
[00:27:38.952 --> 00:27:43.438]  But politicians in England and other countries that were cozy to Hitler early on,
[00:27:43.898 --> 00:27:51.943]  They were excoriated and removed or just resigned, but we're not seeing resignations by a Labour Party that's been lavishing Qaddafi in England.
[00:27:52.203 --> 00:27:59.067]  We're not seeing any of these EU pimps like Sarkozy or Rumpi stepping down.
[00:27:59.087 --> 00:28:05.051]  In fact, they're grandstanding and quite proud of the fact that just months ago they were lip-locked with him.
[00:28:05.791 --> 00:28:08.433]  I mean, are you calling for them to resign?
[00:28:09.373 --> 00:28:10.474]  I am, of course I am.
[00:28:10.494 --> 00:28:12.857]  I mean, I think they're hypocrisy, beggar's belief.
[00:28:13.697 --> 00:28:15.459]  But, you know, sometimes these things take a bit longer.
[00:28:15.479 --> 00:28:18.402]  I mean, your comment about Hitler is, of course, right.
[00:28:18.422 --> 00:28:27.250]  I mean, virtually the entire upper class of Britain were taken in by Hitler, thought he was absolutely wonderful.
[00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:28.892]  The BBC thought he was terrific.
[00:28:30.073 --> 00:28:32.354]  Our King even went to visit him.
[00:28:32.675 --> 00:28:34.116]  Our Parliament thought he was wonderful.
[00:28:34.416 --> 00:28:44.203]  And Churchill, Winston Churchill, and about 20 backbench members of Parliament were derided as being insane, eccentric, warmongers.
[00:28:44.664 --> 00:28:45.785]  In the end, they were right.
[00:28:46.385 --> 00:28:48.407]  And in the end, the bad guys lost their jobs.
[00:28:48.807 --> 00:28:50.368]  And I think the same is going to happen again.
[00:28:50.688 --> 00:28:52.630]  It just may take a little bit longer than we'd like.
[00:28:53.786 --> 00:28:55.567]  Well, the comparison is certainly there.
[00:28:55.587 --> 00:29:02.628]  I mean, if they're going to say Gaddafi's this devil, but then be prancing around with him just months ago, they need to resign.
[00:29:02.648 --> 00:29:03.709]  I mean, this is outrageous.
[00:29:04.029 --> 00:29:09.150]  Yeah, no, I mean, it is sickening hypocrisy in every way.
[00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:12.531]  At the moment, they're being allowed to get away with it.
[00:29:12.571 --> 00:29:15.212]  And I, you know, I look at our mainstream news channels
[00:29:15.672 --> 00:29:15.892]  Absolutely.
[00:29:15.912 --> 00:29:16.172]  UKIP.org.
[00:29:16.232 --> 00:29:19.233]  Nigel Farage, Member of European Parliament.
[00:29:19.293 --> 00:29:19.833]  Thank you, sir.
[00:29:20.173 --> 00:29:20.693]  We'll be back, folks.
[00:29:50.762 --> 00:29:53.743]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.704 --> 00:29:57.405]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.167 --> 00:30:05.449]  Alex has told you about the terrible perfect storm of rising food prices.
[00:30:05.669 --> 00:30:08.551]  The Japanese tragedy proves how important food is.
[00:30:08.871 --> 00:30:11.952]  Our own gas prices are driving food costs through the roof.
[00:30:12.192 --> 00:30:16.895]  The huge population countries are buying up American unprotected exports of food.
[00:30:17.235 --> 00:30:19.356]  The falling dollar is inflating food prices.
[00:30:19.796 --> 00:30:20.477]  We're good to go.
[00:30:39.853 --> 00:30:40.894]  We're good to go!
[00:31:00.215 --> 00:31:01.336]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:31:01.376 --> 00:31:08.042]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:31:08.302 --> 00:31:10.604]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:31:10.864 --> 00:31:16.048]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:31:16.249 --> 00:31:19.031]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:31:19.291 --> 00:31:21.353]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:31:21.593 --> 00:31:27.536]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:31:27.837 --> 00:31:31.038]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:31:31.219 --> 00:31:36.742]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:31:37.002 --> 00:31:38.323]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:31:38.643 --> 00:31:39.844]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:31:39.944 --> 00:31:42.485]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:31:42.625 --> 00:31:44.026]  He explains everything you need to know.
[00:31:44.306 --> 00:31:46.649]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:31:46.829 --> 00:31:51.334]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:31:51.454 --> 00:31:53.917]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[00:31:54.037 --> 00:31:57.762]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:31:57.922 --> 00:31:58.923]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:31:59.944 --> 00:32:03.885]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:32:04.126 --> 00:32:10.148]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:32:10.528 --> 00:32:17.630]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:32:17.911 --> 00:32:22.492]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[00:33:05.846 --> 00:33:07.868]  Devastating globalist lies.
[00:33:08.468 --> 00:33:12.091]  Exposing the mainstream media's propaganda machine.
[00:33:12.811 --> 00:33:15.513]  Tirelessly waging war on corruption.
[00:33:15.974 --> 00:33:19.777]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6 in Austin, Texas.
[00:33:20.317 --> 00:33:22.038]  Transmitting worldwide.
[00:33:22.579 --> 00:33:23.880]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:28.845]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:31.328 --> 00:33:35.913]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[00:33:35.933 --> 00:33:36.374]  to 2 p.m.
[00:33:36.414 --> 00:33:37.775]  Central, we're here live.
[00:33:38.316 --> 00:33:38.596]  Back.
[00:33:39.557 --> 00:33:40.679]  Sunday's 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:33:40.699 --> 00:33:41.479]  Central as well.
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:48.968]  The websites are PrisonPlanet.tv, PrisonPlanet.com, the news site, InfoWars.com, the news site as well.
[00:33:49.789 --> 00:33:54.014]  Now that was our only guest for the day, UK Member of Parliament Nigel Farage.
[00:33:54.935 --> 00:33:59.799]  UK European Union Member of Parliament Nigel Farage with that key information.
[00:33:59.839 --> 00:34:11.007]  Now I want to go over what's happened in Libya, what this means for global government, what the clear strategy and deceptive stratagem and gambit is designed to do.
[00:34:11.887 --> 00:34:18.693]  After I play Senator Rand Paul's response to Obama last night.
[00:34:18.753 --> 00:34:20.975]  Then I'm going to shift gears into the nuclear disaster.
[00:34:21.355 --> 00:34:33.286]  Japan on maximum alert, confirming the news that came out two days ago of 100,000 times safe levels of radioactivity coming out, getting into the groundwater of Japan.
[00:34:34.828 --> 00:34:38.190]  And the evacuation of many areas of Japan is accelerating.
[00:34:38.531 --> 00:34:38.831]  The U.S.
[00:34:38.871 --> 00:34:41.753]  military is quietly trying to force many Americans out of Japan.
[00:34:42.613 --> 00:34:43.894]  They are covering up.
[00:34:44.395 --> 00:34:47.096]  I mean, it's coming out in the mainstream media, but they're not focusing on it.
[00:34:48.818 --> 00:34:58.644]  And they're announcing how critical it is, but they're not pointing out to the general public and not giving the attention to it that it deserves.
[00:34:58.664 --> 00:35:02.307]  They're just calmly talking about it like it's no big deal.
[00:35:03.214 --> 00:35:10.519]  And it's a huge, huge issue to the economy, to the Japanese people, to not just the economy of Japan, but worldwide.
[00:35:10.899 --> 00:35:12.400]  I've got a lot of police state news.
[00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:17.103]  I've got a globalist bid to ban cars as part of Plantopolis Agenda.
[00:35:17.924 --> 00:35:20.105]  They're already teaching school kids in Europe and the U.S.
[00:35:20.145 --> 00:35:21.746]  that they're going to ban cars soon.
[00:35:22.467 --> 00:35:31.373]  The head of the Transportation Department last year did say in the New York Times that cars are the enemy, that all these agendas are anti-car, that they do want to increase fuel prices.
[00:35:32.073 --> 00:35:37.054]  That they do want to shut down our coal-powered systems, so we're completely dependent on the globalists.
[00:35:38.055 --> 00:35:42.676]  Obama pushing to legalize the illegal aliens and continue the North American Union merger.
[00:35:43.596 --> 00:35:47.017]  The Feds are moving to throw out Jesse Ventura's lawsuit against the TSA.
[00:35:47.317 --> 00:35:48.798]  He is scheduled to be on next week.
[00:35:48.858 --> 00:35:52.039]  We need to double confirm that, because he's just now about to get back to the U.S.
[00:35:52.059 --> 00:35:52.679]  from Mexico.
[00:35:53.619 --> 00:35:59.324]  All of that is coming up, and in the second and third hour today, we're going to have wide open telephones.
[00:35:59.364 --> 00:36:00.805]  But I don't want you to have to sit there on hold.
[00:36:01.285 --> 00:36:03.267]  At the start of the next hour, I will give the number out.
[00:36:03.607 --> 00:36:07.810]  Everybody's welcome to call in then with any item, any news story, anything you wish to discuss.
[00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:16.677]  But I wanted to, before I go into some of Obama's speech and things he said last night, I wanted to have Senator Rand Paul, who's trying to cut
[00:36:18.278 --> 00:36:27.421]  The spending by 500 billion when the rest are only pushing for 100 billion Who is pushing to abolish the fellow reserve or at least audit it who is against these new wars?
[00:36:28.562 --> 00:36:31.202]  Who is really proving to be a chip off the old block?
[00:36:32.143 --> 00:36:41.246]  From his father and quite frankly out of the gates and even better speaker Show a very exciting to see Rand Paul and the work that he's doing
[00:36:42.046 --> 00:36:47.249]  Of course, he plays along a bit with the narrative about Al-Qaeda and why are we backing Al-Qaeda.
[00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:51.632]  They are backing Al-Qaeda, but he's saying, well, these are the people that attacked us.
[00:36:51.752 --> 00:37:02.358]  Well, actually, British SAS got caught in 2006, London Guardian reported, dressed up as Al-Qaeda, shooting Shiites to get sectarian war going in Basra.
[00:37:03.198 --> 00:37:04.799]  Al-Qaeda was used to attack the Serbs.
[00:37:04.879 --> 00:37:10.040]  Al-Qaeda was used to attack, of course, the Russians.
[00:37:10.721 --> 00:37:18.503]  Al-Qaeda, led by Anwar al-Awlaki, is working for the Pentagon, AP, Fox News, running all the major attacks in the U.S.
[00:37:18.543 --> 00:37:18.943]  and Europe.
[00:37:19.364 --> 00:37:20.464]  And he's always protected.
[00:37:20.964 --> 00:37:28.507]  Just like Rashoun Aswad was caught, and was in the major British papers, being MI6, running the 7-7 attacks.
[00:37:29.867 --> 00:37:42.301]  See, a lot of times they have moron-level real jihadists who don't know they're working for globalists who are funding them and posing with their big beards and their turbans and giving them the money.
[00:37:42.782 --> 00:37:45.685]  In other cases, they think they're taking part in anti-terror drills.
[00:37:46.046 --> 00:37:50.210]  They're given satchels or they're told to do drills on aircraft and then you know the rest of the story.
[00:37:51.031 --> 00:37:52.571]  And that's come out time and time again.
[00:37:52.632 --> 00:37:56.233]  Operation Northwoods talks about how to frame patsies in bombings of U.S.
[00:37:56.273 --> 00:38:07.636]  cities, hijacked jets, shootings that the Pentagon would carry out with troops dressed up as foreign enemies as a pretext to basically destroy the Republic.
[00:38:08.436 --> 00:38:09.736]  You see, look at third world countries.
[00:38:09.996 --> 00:38:12.057]  Look at Rome with Julius Caesar.
[00:38:12.317 --> 00:38:12.957]  Look at Hitler.
[00:38:13.337 --> 00:38:18.719]  They always use the military in the name of fighting an outside threat to take over.
[00:38:20.424 --> 00:38:23.205]  Burning their own Reichstag, February 27th, 1933.
[00:38:25.366 --> 00:38:27.266]  1939, Gleiwitz to launch the attack on Poland.
[00:38:29.227 --> 00:38:30.187]  In the German documents.
[00:38:30.908 --> 00:38:37.430]  The Germans on the Polish border took a few prisoners out of a concentration camp, dressed them up in Polish uniforms, shot them.
[00:38:38.410 --> 00:38:40.571]  Dressed a few up in German uniforms, shot them.
[00:38:41.847 --> 00:38:53.256]  And then shot newsreels that the Poles, with their horse-drawn artillery, had attacked the military communications base.
[00:38:54.417 --> 00:38:55.658]  And you know what happened next.
[00:38:56.079 --> 00:38:58.060]  See, people just think Hitler just attacked Poland.
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:38:59.021]  Go read the history.
[00:38:59.061 --> 00:39:01.863]  He attacked when the Poles launched a sneak attack.
[00:39:02.283 --> 00:39:04.825]  It's the oldest trick in the book.
[00:39:05.865 --> 00:39:08.467]  And the people running our country are the terrorists.
[00:39:08.527 --> 00:39:09.507]  They're not our government.
[00:39:09.827 --> 00:39:10.848]  They're not legitimate.
[00:39:11.308 --> 00:39:14.150]  They are doing everything they can to destroy this republic.
[00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:15.491]  Don't forget that.
[00:39:16.191 --> 00:39:31.019]  And they are sifting through the military and police ranks, and corporate ranks with InfraGard, and the clergy's ranks, to find people that want to be anti-American spies, terrorist controllers, for the full martial law takeover that they're setting up.
[00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:33.180]  And if you don't think it can't happen here,
[00:39:34.588 --> 00:39:46.415]  Major General Smedley Butler, two-time Congressional Medal of Honor winner, who'd overthrown countless third world countries for the gunboat diplomacy system that our country had then, back in the 20s and 30s.
[00:39:47.116 --> 00:39:51.839]  He was approached by Prescott Bush, by the Harrimans, by others.
[00:39:52.079 --> 00:40:01.565]  There were Congressional hearings on this, to lead a group of 500,000 former and current military and police, who'd already been recruited, to overthrow the U.S.
[00:40:01.605 --> 00:40:03.266]  government and merge with Hitler.
[00:40:04.039 --> 00:40:10.642]  You just heard Nigel Farage, member of the European Union Parliament from England, talk about the majority of the British government wanted to merge with Hitler.
[00:40:11.502 --> 00:40:12.943]  This was a major move.
[00:40:14.003 --> 00:40:17.185]  But instead, the equally bad socialist
[00:40:18.274 --> 00:40:25.380]  position themselves to then fight against Hitler when they'd actually been involved financing him from the beginning.
[00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:30.344]  This is the extremely sophisticated strategy of the New World Order.
[00:40:30.384 --> 00:40:31.925]  They call it full-spectrum dominance.
[00:40:32.245 --> 00:40:37.349]  That doesn't just mean air, land, sea communications, but info war.
[00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:42.433]  But they use the weapon of lies, we use the far more powerful weapon of truth.
[00:40:43.254 --> 00:40:49.358]  But full spectrum dominance means controlling all sides, funding the foreign armies, funding the terrorists.
[00:40:49.378 --> 00:40:55.842]  It goes back to the Rothschilds and others, going back over 300 years, financing both sides in every major European conflict.
[00:40:56.162 --> 00:40:56.743]  Who wins?
[00:40:56.943 --> 00:40:57.283]  They do.
[00:40:58.344 --> 00:40:59.384]  This is the system.
[00:40:59.865 --> 00:41:02.226]  And as soon as you figure that out, you understand it all.
[00:41:02.266 --> 00:41:03.407]  Then it makes perfect sense.
[00:41:04.368 --> 00:41:06.449]  Again, how long have I told you Al-Qaeda works for the West?
[00:41:07.069 --> 00:41:09.031]  Now they're out in the open going, yeah, they're Al-Qaeda.
[00:41:10.208 --> 00:41:10.709]  So what?
[00:41:11.349 --> 00:41:13.031]  Yeah, Saudi Arabia is shipping in weapons.
[00:41:13.092 --> 00:41:13.612]  So what?
[00:41:14.173 --> 00:41:14.894]  Forget about it.
[00:41:15.594 --> 00:41:16.115]  Move along.
[00:41:16.155 --> 00:41:16.816]  Nothing to see here.
[00:41:16.836 --> 00:41:25.927]  Alright, here is Rand Paul's little five-minute response to Obama's ridiculous grandstanding speech.
[00:41:26.447 --> 00:41:28.870]  He's the big humanitarian with all these wars.
[00:41:28.930 --> 00:41:29.251]  Here it is.
[00:41:31.294 --> 00:41:38.460]  The President of the United States often faces unforeseeable dilemmas that demand tough decisions based on reliable intelligence.
[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:42.803]  The recent events in Libya presented President Obama with such a scenario.
[00:41:43.283 --> 00:41:51.630]  But how our Commander-in-Chief chose to handle this new dilemma raises serious questions about his understanding of constitutional checks and balances.
[00:41:52.310 --> 00:41:57.134]  Libyan President Muammar Gaddafi is every bit the madman Ronald Reagan once said he was.
[00:41:57.634 --> 00:42:04.559]  But are the rebels adherence to Jeffersonian democracy or Bin Laden's radical jihad?
[00:42:04.599 --> 00:42:18.810]  In 2007, then-candidate Obama said that the president does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation.
[00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:21.072]  I agree with the candidate Obama.
[00:42:21.872 --> 00:42:25.115]  Unfortunately, President Obama has failed to heed his own advice.
[00:42:25.675 --> 00:42:32.621]  He has ignored our Constitution and engaged us in a military conflict without Congressional debate and approval.
[00:42:33.521 --> 00:42:37.104]  What imminent threat did Qaddafi or Libya pose to the United States?
[00:42:37.845 --> 00:42:48.713]  Obviously, the decision to take military action of this magnitude is something that should not be taken lightly and should first require determining whether it is in the United States' vital national interests.
[00:42:49.614 --> 00:42:55.538]  Over the weekend, even Defense Secretary Robert Gates admitted that America has no vital interest in Libya.
[00:42:56.279 --> 00:42:59.921]  Our brave men and women in uniform are patriotic defenders of our nation.
[00:43:00.462 --> 00:43:08.768]  They are members of the greatest military in the world, and in times of war, I am confident of their willingness and ability to ensure that our vital interests are protected.
[00:43:09.468 --> 00:43:12.810]  But they should not be asked to be nation builders or the world's policemen.
[00:43:13.371 --> 00:43:19.555]  And they should serve in wars authorized and called for by the United States Congress, not the United Nations.
[00:43:20.276 --> 00:43:23.798]  At the moment, there are uprisings taking place across the Middle East.
[00:43:24.319 --> 00:43:25.720]  The problem with sending U.S.
[00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:33.926]  military to help rebels in Libya or anywhere else is that we are taking sides in a conflict and on behalf of a people whom we know nothing about.
[00:43:35.362 --> 00:43:41.146]  When or if there is regime change in Libya, what kind of leadership exactly will replace Gaddafi?
[00:43:41.627 --> 00:43:43.808]  Who are the Libyan rebels exactly?
[00:43:44.248 --> 00:43:52.734]  The Daily Telegraph reported over the weekend that some Libyan rebel leaders now claim they have members of Al-Qaeda within their ranks and are glad to have them.
[00:43:53.375 --> 00:44:02.561]  Why do we have American soldiers, our best and bravest, helping people in Libya who may be the very same people we ask our military to fight in Afghanistan and Iraq?
[00:44:03.442 --> 00:44:13.185]  Intervening in a civil war in a tribal society in which our government admits that we have no vital interest to help people we do not know simply does not make any sense.
[00:44:13.765 --> 00:44:29.069]  Libyan society is complicated and we simply do not know enough about the potential outcomes or leaders to know if this will end up in the interest of the United States or if we are in fact helping to install a radical Islamic government in place of a secular dictatorship.
[00:44:30.515 --> 00:44:34.957]  Of even more lasting concern is how our troops were committed to this battle by President Obama.
[00:44:35.538 --> 00:44:43.622]  The Founding Fathers understood the seriousness of war and thus included in our Constitution a provision stating that only Congress can declare war.
[00:44:44.122 --> 00:44:47.044]  The decision to wage war should not be taken cavalierly.
[00:44:47.624 --> 00:44:58.430]  As Madison wrote, the Constitution supposes what the history of all governments demonstrates, that the executive is the branch of power most interested in war and most prone to it.
[00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:04.232]  It has accordingly, with studied care, vested the question of war in the legislature.
[00:45:05.072 --> 00:45:15.876]  If President Obama had consulted Congress, as our Constitution requires him to do, perhaps we could have debated these questions before hastily involving ourselves in yet another Middle Eastern conflict.
[00:45:16.576 --> 00:45:20.417]  While the president is the commander of our armed forces, he is not a king.
[00:45:20.997 --> 00:45:27.878]  He may involve those forces in military conflict only when authorized by Congress or in response to an imminent threat.
[00:45:28.538 --> 00:45:29.739]  Neither was the case here.
[00:45:30.499 --> 00:45:33.399]  We are already in two wars that we are not paying for.
[00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:39.521]  We are waging war across the Middle East on a credit card, one whose limit is rapidly approaching.
[00:45:40.221 --> 00:45:45.362]  We already borrow money from countries like China to pay for our wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[00:45:45.982 --> 00:45:52.746]  Should we continue borrowing money and saddling future generations with debt to pay for our current actions in Libya?
[00:45:53.666 --> 00:45:58.349]  The subtext to the President's speech concerning Libya tonight was, what if we had done nothing?
[00:45:58.969 --> 00:46:04.172]  But a better question might be, what if helping Libya's interests actually hurts America's interests?
[00:46:04.772 --> 00:46:10.756]  What if we are sending our military to places where we might actually be helping the same terrorists we fight in other countries?
[00:46:11.736 --> 00:46:20.126]  It's time that we re-examine these policies by once again consulting the Constitution on such matters and the common sense principles that made this country great.
[00:46:20.667 --> 00:46:28.256]  We can no longer afford to spend what we don't have and we can't afford to address every other nation's problems before we address our own.
[00:46:29.631 --> 00:46:34.333]  Over the coming days and weeks, Congress will force President Obama to confront these questions.
[00:46:34.974 --> 00:46:40.296]  Our brave young men and women have answered the call of duty time and time again over the past decade.
[00:46:40.937 --> 00:46:53.583]  Our soldiers deserve, at the very least, that before we send them into a third war, that Congress, the People's House, deliberate, debate, and decide whether this war is in our vital national interests.
[00:46:54.223 --> 00:46:57.925]  Thank you for listening tonight, and God bless the United States of America.
[00:46:59.338 --> 00:47:03.061]  All right, that's Senator Rand Paul laying it all out.
[00:47:03.901 --> 00:47:05.142]  Here are some of the headlines.
[00:47:05.222 --> 00:47:10.426]  Washington Times anti-genocide advocate credits Obama for Libyan uprising.
[00:47:10.446 --> 00:47:11.046]  Well, no kidding.
[00:47:11.087 --> 00:47:14.729]  Western powers, run by the bankers, went in there and started this whole thing.
[00:47:15.149 --> 00:47:17.951]  Just like they admit they started Egypt to kick out their old dictator.
[00:47:18.412 --> 00:47:23.155]  And now they've completely banned all protesting, the Financial Times of London has reported.
[00:47:23.175 --> 00:47:25.277]  And they're reportedly raping the women.
[00:47:26.513 --> 00:47:34.542]  Just like they kicked Saddam, their old propped-up dictator, out and put in new corrupt systems that are enslaving the people of Iraq.
[00:47:35.182 --> 00:47:42.230]  The globalists don't want liberty or freedom in place and they've lied to us and said this isn't a war, it's a kinetic military action.
[00:47:43.471 --> 00:47:50.514]  They've said, oh, we don't want ground troops, we want a humanitarian force on the ground, as British Marines mass in ships, and U.S.
[00:47:50.674 --> 00:47:56.457]  Marines mass in ships, and the Marines have gotten the internal memo and haven't even been told to lie.
[00:47:57.298 --> 00:48:01.139]  Their officers have come out even a week ago and again today and said, yeah, we're preparing to land.
[00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:02.620]  We're preparing to go in.
[00:48:03.621 --> 00:48:10.324]  They're massing troops off the coast and still telling you it's not a war as they bomb the daylights out of the country every single day.
[00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:13.320]  Now you think about that, even if you're for this war.
[00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:15.001]  They're lying to you.
[00:48:15.021 --> 00:48:16.721]  I mean, do you like being lied to?
[00:48:16.781 --> 00:48:23.342]  This is about global government and setting the precedent that the globalists can institute a rebellion with their operatives in a country.
[00:48:23.942 --> 00:48:27.063]  Sure, a lot of the folks are mad, have a reason to be angry, they join in.
[00:48:28.183 --> 00:48:30.843]  And the globalists then can take over country after country.
[00:48:30.863 --> 00:48:31.944]  And here's what's in the news today.
[00:48:32.464 --> 00:48:40.405]  The globalists have already in the East set up a new central bank, controlled by the IMF and World Bank, and a new oil company to basically give the globalists the oil.
[00:48:41.530 --> 00:48:43.753]  to then fund the ongoing rebel operations.
[00:48:43.893 --> 00:48:45.715]  They're already doing it.
[00:48:46.076 --> 00:48:50.601]  When the Serbs got bombed into submission, they then accepted a foreign central bank.
[00:48:51.022 --> 00:48:55.447]  They then accepted the loan sharking loans to get them into debt.
[00:48:56.088 --> 00:48:58.511]  Whether these countries are good, bad, whatever they are,
[00:48:59.292 --> 00:49:14.336]  The issue is the global imperium is going in and taking over every sovereign country left on earth, marching towards Damascus and Syria, openly talking about no-fly zones and invasions there in the south, openly talking about going into Iran.
[00:49:14.596 --> 00:49:20.678]  Two and a half years ago, the globalists admittedly launched those rebellions in Iran, trying to overthrow that government.
[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:28.568]  Hoping that that government would then launch military attacks back, or terror attacks, so they could take more of our liberties here and launch a bigger war.
[00:49:28.588 --> 00:49:31.812]  I mean, you can see how the New World Order is going to take over countries now.
[00:49:32.092 --> 00:49:36.517]  They just fund some rebels, then say they're humanitarians, they could even be Al-Qaeda.
[00:49:36.817 --> 00:49:40.161]  We're told they're the good guys, you're not for Al-Qaeda, you're with the terrorists.
[00:49:40.842 --> 00:49:42.503]  This is how crazy this is.
[00:49:42.923 --> 00:49:44.644]  This is how unconstitutional this is.
[00:49:44.965 --> 00:49:47.686]  This is how dumb the system thinks you are.
[00:49:48.107 --> 00:49:52.449]  But Obama last night again strongly defended the military action.
[00:49:53.110 --> 00:49:56.192]  The Associated Press calls it a war that's been launched.
[00:49:56.312 --> 00:49:58.413]  I thought it's a kinetic military action.
[00:49:59.013 --> 00:50:01.255]  Obama says Libyan civilian massacre would have
[00:50:01.735 --> 00:50:05.779]  Stained world conscience kind of like the UN organized massacre.
[00:50:05.819 --> 00:50:12.347]  We now learn they didn't just stand by they ran it in Rwanda to get rid of the Christians you mean like that one hundreds of thousands dead
[00:50:13.772 --> 00:50:14.813]  Again, here's Reuters.
[00:50:15.273 --> 00:50:15.533]  U.S.
[00:50:15.553 --> 00:50:17.734]  says Libyan rebels may sell oil.
[00:50:17.754 --> 00:50:20.475]  They're setting up their new globalist-run oil company.
[00:50:20.515 --> 00:50:21.075]  Here's another one.
[00:50:21.936 --> 00:50:25.737]  Wow, that was fast by the Economic Collapse blog at Infowars.com.
[00:50:26.178 --> 00:50:30.300]  Libyan rebels have already established a new central bank of Libya.
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:31.600]  Oh, guess what?
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:33.861]  Qaddafi had their own government-run bank.
[00:50:33.881 --> 00:50:35.242]  It wasn't run by foreign bankers.
[00:50:35.982 --> 00:50:36.723]  Oh, look at Ireland.
[00:50:36.763 --> 00:50:38.224]  It's been taken over by foreign banks now.
[00:50:38.705 --> 00:50:42.308]  The head of their Federal Reserve said it was good to, quote, be run by foreign banks.
[00:50:42.348 --> 00:50:43.249]  Yes, it's good!
[00:50:43.889 --> 00:50:45.311]  Radiation's good for you.
[00:50:45.751 --> 00:50:47.012]  Tyranny's good for you.
[00:50:47.393 --> 00:50:50.095]  TSA sticking their hands down your pants is good for you.
[00:50:50.536 --> 00:50:52.197]  Not having freedom is good for you.
[00:50:52.658 --> 00:50:54.679]  Having foreign banks own you is good for you.
[00:50:55.380 --> 00:50:59.063]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, on the other side of this quick break to get into the reactors.
[00:51:00.765 --> 00:51:05.226]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:52:38.493 --> 00:52:38.773]  I don't know.
[00:53:00.359 --> 00:53:03.461]  Do you want to learn more about preparing for the hard times ahead?
[00:53:03.601 --> 00:53:08.203]  Have you ever thought about actually getting off the grid and becoming truly self-reliant?

[00:54:16.493 --> 00:54:23.719]  So, bottom line, this entire invasion is the New World Order, globalist
[00:54:39.028 --> 00:54:41.353]  model to invade and take countries over.
[00:54:41.834 --> 00:54:46.763]  If they can't have rebels overthrow the government outright and that fails, then they back it up with military action.
[00:54:47.642 --> 00:54:49.003]  And that's all that's happening here.
[00:54:49.483 --> 00:54:51.445]  And it's a huge destabilization program.
[00:54:52.185 --> 00:54:55.527]  And it sets the precedent for other countries, not just what happened with Serbia.
[00:54:56.068 --> 00:55:06.094]  But the United States, you name it, if the UN says, hey, we like these rebels, even if they're al-Qaeda or illegal aliens, whatever the case is, we're going to support this happening.
[00:55:06.414 --> 00:55:08.836]  And your government has no authority.
[00:55:08.916 --> 00:55:09.917]  It is a huge
[00:55:10.757 --> 00:55:16.681]  Huge development, and on top of it, we have the President not even consulting the Congress.
[00:55:17.222 --> 00:55:19.363]  Just amazing that this is happening.
[00:55:19.684 --> 00:55:30.571]  We're going to have open phones on Libya, on the dollar, on George Soros, openly announcing a new Bretton Woods 2 at the original hotel resort where the dollar was set up as the world reserve currency.
[00:55:30.591 --> 00:55:32.113]  They're having all the big banking heads come.
[00:55:32.853 --> 00:55:35.096]  to decide how to move away from the dollar.
[00:55:35.797 --> 00:55:37.038]  That's in the Wall Street Journal.
[00:55:37.179 --> 00:55:39.281]  You name it, this is openly happening.
[00:55:39.702 --> 00:55:43.226]  The war is being used as a distraction for the imploding economy.
[00:55:43.827 --> 00:55:46.210]  We've got all that news and information we're going to be covering.
[00:55:46.811 --> 00:55:47.912]  And going back to what
[00:55:48.673 --> 00:55:54.774]  is currently unfolding in Japan and now 17 days into this crisis.
[00:55:55.194 --> 00:55:57.655]  Japan on maximum alert over nuclear plant.
[00:55:58.715 --> 00:56:09.778]  Their prime minister has come out and said that they are on maximum alert because of 100,000 times safe levels of uranium plutonium now getting into the ground and groundwater.
[00:56:10.898 --> 00:56:11.098]  Just
[00:56:12.398 --> 00:56:13.138]  Horrible news.
[00:56:13.178 --> 00:56:14.338]  But I mean, we knew this weeks ago.
[00:56:14.598 --> 00:56:17.719]  They're pumping in seawater on top of these five reactors.
[00:56:18.279 --> 00:56:27.361]  They can't get electricity hooked back up because even though they ran a new electricity line that was knocked over by the tsunami and earthquake, the pumps are all smashed.
[00:56:28.181 --> 00:56:34.962]  They've now had to again pull back the workers because the radiation is so high that you get a lethal dose in five hours.
[00:56:35.462 --> 00:56:37.422]  You get 1,000 millisieverts an hour.
[00:56:37.702 --> 00:56:38.383]  That's 5,000 in five hours.
[00:56:40.703 --> 00:56:42.465]  This situation is out of control.
[00:56:43.286 --> 00:56:53.736]  And if you've got five reactors that have partially melted down or exploded, and fuel rods thrown in every different direction, what do you think is going to happen if they can't even get the crews in there to try to even dump concrete on it?
[00:56:54.897 --> 00:56:57.560]  And besides, below that is the groundwater table.
[00:56:58.861 --> 00:57:01.063]  Large areas of Japan are going to be uninhabitable.
[00:57:01.884 --> 00:57:03.326]  And you criticize it.
[00:57:04.363 --> 00:57:13.826]  George Monbiot, the big liberal world population reduction rock star, comes out and says you're an idiot and that he loves nuclear power now.
[00:57:14.386 --> 00:57:16.246]  Just nonsensical in your face.
[00:57:16.946 --> 00:57:17.907]  No intellectual debate.
[00:57:18.167 --> 00:57:18.747]  He's the boss.
[00:57:18.767 --> 00:57:19.627]  You must do what he says.
[00:57:19.967 --> 00:57:21.308]  Ann Coulter on the fake right.
[00:57:21.508 --> 00:57:21.968]  Same thing.
[00:57:22.008 --> 00:57:22.668]  It's good for you.
[00:57:22.708 --> 00:57:23.108]  Shut up.
[00:57:23.528 --> 00:57:24.168]  You're crazy.
[00:57:24.409 --> 00:57:25.409]  You won't get cancer now.
[00:57:26.269 --> 00:57:30.633]  Yeah, five hours of this and you've got a 50% chance of dying in just a few weeks, even the Washington Post admits.
[00:57:30.993 --> 00:57:37.298]  But let's just forget all that, because Ann Coulter and the nuclear lobby and Mambi on the left, they say it's fine.
[00:57:38.099 --> 00:57:50.189]  They wave their magic wand, and if you don't like radiation now, if you think DU's bad for the troops, if you don't want the military to have a shooting range outside your town using it and getting into your groundwater, you're bad.
[00:57:51.223 --> 00:57:51.843]  You're bad.
[00:57:52.624 --> 00:57:54.005]  You're bad for being informed.
[00:57:54.125 --> 00:57:55.146]  You're bad for caring.
[00:57:55.506 --> 00:57:57.588]  You're bad for actually doing research.
[00:57:58.188 --> 00:58:03.332]  Just sit down, shut up, breathe deeply, give water to your kids, filled with radiation.
[00:58:03.492 --> 00:58:04.052]  It's fun.
[00:58:04.392 --> 00:58:05.133]  It's nutritious.
[00:58:05.453 --> 00:58:10.817]  Let the TSA put you in their baking machines, their microwave machines.
[00:58:11.097 --> 00:58:13.499]  Doesn't matter if they lied about the radiation levels as well.
[00:58:13.699 --> 00:58:17.762]  Doesn't matter if it's leaking out and splattering the people that work at the TSA.
[00:58:18.242 --> 00:58:19.423]  Just magic wand.
[00:58:19.783 --> 00:58:20.364]  It's good for you.
[00:58:21.084 --> 00:58:22.145]  Globalism's good for you.
[00:58:22.205 --> 00:58:23.305]  NAFTA and GATT's good for you.
[00:58:23.725 --> 00:58:24.706]  Don't you like it, folks?
[00:58:24.726 --> 00:58:25.366]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:58:25.386 --> 00:58:25.446]  800-259-9231.
[00:58:25.466 --> 00:58:27.848]  Masses of important news, key video and audio clips.
[00:58:27.868 --> 00:58:31.249]  Your phone calls straight ahead in hour number two.
[00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:31.830]  Stay with us.

[00:58:51.274 --> 00:59:05.746]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:59:06.747 --> 00:59:10.430]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:59:11.434 --> 00:59:23.425]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:59:24.186 --> 00:59:31.472]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:59:32.153 --> 00:59:41.739]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:45.802]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:59:46.443 --> 00:59:49.645]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:59:53.307 --> 00:59:55.249]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.689 --> 00:59:58.451]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.117 --> 01:00:09.319]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.939 --> 01:00:10.760]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:12.501]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.081 --> 01:00:16.663]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.263 --> 01:00:21.385]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.047 --> 01:00:28.469]  We are now live into our number two.
[01:00:29.509 --> 01:00:32.031]  We're going to be taking your phone calls.
[01:00:38.914 --> 01:00:50.899]  And then coming up, more on Obama's speech last night, and how they're hailing wars, invasions, imperial takeovers as good.
[01:00:51.019 --> 01:00:58.203]  They have rebels that the globalist finance attack, and if they're unable to overthrow the country like they were Egypt, they invade.
[01:00:58.263 --> 01:00:59.623]  They start bombing and then they invade.
[01:00:59.643 --> 01:01:01.904]  And then they lie and say it's not a war when we're bombing them.
[01:01:02.464 --> 01:01:06.446]  We're not going to invade with ground troops, but we do want to have a humanitarian ground force.
[01:01:06.806 --> 01:01:08.007]  The Marines are standing by.
[01:01:09.588 --> 01:01:11.810]  That's how stupid they think you are.
[01:01:12.030 --> 01:01:13.872]  The latest on what's happening in Fukushima.
[01:01:14.092 --> 01:01:16.534]  100,000 times safe levels of radiation.
[01:01:16.594 --> 01:01:18.295]  Maximum alert, the Prime Minister says.
[01:01:19.611 --> 01:01:23.774]  Also, globalists bid to ban cars, part of a Plantopolis agenda.
[01:01:24.214 --> 01:01:26.676]  The EU has openly announced they will begin banning cars.
[01:01:27.237 --> 01:01:29.658]  You cannot make this stuff up, it's so incredible.
[01:01:30.019 --> 01:01:34.362]  TSA moves against Jesse Ventura's suit against him, trying to have it thrown out of court.
[01:01:34.762 --> 01:01:35.783]  That's all coming up.
[01:01:35.823 --> 01:01:38.845]  The Syrian cabinet has resigned amid huge protest.
[01:01:39.266 --> 01:01:44.930]  Remember when Haji Mubarak wouldn't resign after a month-long globalist orchestrated protest?
[01:01:46.274 --> 01:01:48.654]  He just suddenly had a stroke and we've never seen again.
[01:01:48.754 --> 01:01:49.815]  Who knows if he's even alive?
[01:01:50.555 --> 01:01:51.415]  You gotta love that.
[01:01:52.155 --> 01:01:52.715]  Works well.
[01:01:52.735 --> 01:01:57.996]  So we're gonna take a lot of your phone calls right now and then at the bottom of the hour get back into some of the other news we haven't covered yet.
[01:01:58.456 --> 01:02:00.097]  Joe in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:02:01.417 --> 01:02:02.257]  Alex, how are you, sir?
[01:02:02.397 --> 01:02:02.637]  Good.
[01:02:03.537 --> 01:02:08.178]  Alex, I'm calling about your interview with Larry Pratt yesterday.
[01:02:08.758 --> 01:02:13.719]  You know, the Border Patrol agent Brian Terry down in Arizona,
[01:02:14.488 --> 01:02:15.729]  That was basically murdered.
[01:02:16.149 --> 01:02:20.853]  That family should file murder charges on the ATF.
[01:02:20.993 --> 01:02:21.314]  That's right.
[01:02:21.334 --> 01:02:26.918]  It's reportedly guns that ATF shipped into Mexico, allowed to be shipped in, that were then used to kill him.
[01:02:27.919 --> 01:02:28.480]  Exactly.
[01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:33.944]  And that family should file charges, murder charges, against the ATFE, man.
[01:02:34.625 --> 01:02:36.026]  And that just, I mean, that
[01:02:36.747 --> 01:02:38.147]  That's, that's wrong, brother.
[01:02:38.287 --> 01:02:42.889]  And what they did, and what he did standing up for Obama last night, that was pathetic.
[01:02:43.309 --> 01:02:46.870]  Trying to look like a real American, you know, while our boys die.
[01:02:46.890 --> 01:02:57.433]  Because, Alex, I was in Marine Corps, and we were, when we were sent down to Panama, and that was all over Noriega and drug deals and cartels, and they're doing the same thing.
[01:02:57.453 --> 01:03:03.875]  And they claimed it was to save two college girls, and when they finally got them, they said, we weren't held captive, it was all made up.
[01:03:05.083 --> 01:03:05.483]  Yes, sir.
[01:03:06.063 --> 01:03:13.406]  But anyway, I think they should file murder charges on the ATFE, along with a couple other agents that's been killed down there.
[01:03:14.286 --> 01:03:26.350]  Because my daughter's in the Border Patrol, she's bilingual, and I think they should file murder charges on them, or at least call congressmen, representatives, and get it underway.
[01:03:26.410 --> 01:03:33.412]  I know Larry and his group, gun owners, is trying to do it, but we need to just stay on top of them, and God bless you for your work, Alex.
[01:03:33.792 --> 01:03:34.872]  Well, very well said, Joe.
[01:03:34.932 --> 01:03:41.795]  Thank you, and we hope your daughter's safe down there doing something that's actually constitutional under the federal government's auspices.
[01:03:42.235 --> 01:03:46.157]  The feds do everything they're not supposed to do under the Constitution, including following U.N.
[01:03:46.237 --> 01:03:52.700]  orders, and then won't allow the three things the federal government has purview to engage in for that to be properly carried out.
[01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:54.640]  And it's because they want to merge the U.S.
[01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:55.681]  with Mexico and Canada.
[01:03:56.261 --> 01:04:12.136]  And it has been confirmed now, it's all over the mainstream news, Ottawa Citizen, you name it, that they've signed deals with the Pentagon and foreign governments to use, quote, foreign troops from Canada and Mexico to, quote, deal with insurrection and civil unrest with the American people.
[01:04:12.276 --> 01:04:21.924]  I mean, it's just unbelievably, incredibly treasonous things are going on out in the open and
[01:04:23.010 --> 01:04:26.092]  It doesn't happen with a bang, it happens with a whimper.
[01:04:26.133 --> 01:04:27.554]  It's like people email me constantly.
[01:04:27.574 --> 01:04:29.555]  It's one of these false memes out there.
[01:04:29.575 --> 01:04:31.837]  Of Alex, where's the martial law?
[01:04:32.978 --> 01:04:37.802]  Well, I don't know, when the banks steal the veterans' death benefits secretly and it comes out and nobody gets in trouble.
[01:04:40.549 --> 01:04:43.110]  $23.7 trillion plus has been stolen.
[01:04:43.130 --> 01:04:44.131]  They won't say where the money went.
[01:04:45.691 --> 01:04:48.112]  They've got TSA running checkpoints on the highways.
[01:04:49.053 --> 01:04:53.535]  The federal government, the ATF's ordering gun dealers to not do certain sales even though there's no law.
[01:04:53.935 --> 01:04:55.636]  I mean, that's what martial law is.
[01:04:55.756 --> 01:04:57.276]  But they never announce it.
[01:04:57.597 --> 01:04:59.958]  They just slowly unfold these systems.
[01:04:59.978 --> 01:05:00.418]  We'll be back.
[01:05:00.438 --> 01:05:04.540]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:05.420]  Number one.
[01:05:05.740 --> 01:05:09.744]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:10.024 --> 01:05:14.589]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:14.929 --> 01:05:15.370]  It's true.
[01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:21.095]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:21.376 --> 01:05:24.659]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:24.959 --> 01:05:28.663]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:28.863 --> 01:05:29.404]  Number 4.
[01:05:29.644 --> 01:05:32.006]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:32.406 --> 01:05:35.789]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:36.089 --> 01:05:36.310]  Number 5.
[01:05:36.890 --> 01:05:40.813]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:05:41.034 --> 01:05:45.798]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:05:46.078 --> 01:05:50.099]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:50.239 --> 01:05:51.799]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:52.039 --> 01:05:54.100]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:57.481]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:06:00.041 --> 01:06:03.822]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[01:06:03.882 --> 01:06:07.903]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[01:06:08.163 --> 01:06:12.724]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[01:06:12.844 --> 01:06:14.765]  I'm looking for a factory
[01:06:15.525 --> 01:06:19.108]  We're American and be proud.
[01:06:19.189 --> 01:06:22.752]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[01:06:41.682 --> 01:06:54.793]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[01:07:00.504 --> 01:07:04.788]  Alex has told you about the terrible perfect storm of rising food prices.
[01:07:05.028 --> 01:07:07.891]  The Japanese tragedy proves how important food is.
[01:07:08.232 --> 01:07:11.315]  Our own gas prices are driving food costs through the roof.
[01:07:11.555 --> 01:07:16.239]  The huge population countries are buying up American unprotected exports of food.
[01:07:16.580 --> 01:07:18.722]  The falling dollars inflating food prices.
[01:07:19.142 --> 01:07:19.823]  We're good to go.
[01:07:39.155 --> 01:07:42.016]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:26.353 --> 01:08:32.899]  What's happening is the system is keeping the people in the dark.
[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:37.223]  They call a military bombardment kinetic military action.
[01:08:37.524 --> 01:08:38.625]  They say it's not a war.
[01:08:39.506 --> 01:08:39.866]  U.S.
[01:08:39.926 --> 01:08:45.552]  and British Marines massing by the thousands in troop landing ships off the coast of Tripoli
[01:08:46.843 --> 01:08:54.926]  In the Mediterranean, and the Marines openly saying they're preparing to invade, that's not a ground force, that's a peace force.
[01:08:55.326 --> 01:09:12.332]  See, the UN is all about peace when they kill hundreds of thousands of Christians in Rwanda and set up checkpoints not letting the Christian people out so that the Hutus could come in and kill them.
[01:09:13.206 --> 01:09:14.127]  This is how the U.N.
[01:09:14.307 --> 01:09:20.210]  operates all over the world, because it's just a receivership arm created by the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds, openly.
[01:09:20.570 --> 01:09:22.891]  David Rockefeller's bragged about this in his memoirs.
[01:09:22.952 --> 01:09:27.274]  In fact, I IM'd you this morning a quote by David Rockefeller.
[01:09:27.294 --> 01:09:31.897]  We actually have his book back there somewhere, about how he admits world government, and that's what he wants.
[01:09:32.637 --> 01:09:34.179]  You know, he's guilty as charged.
[01:09:34.419 --> 01:09:39.886]  We've read it many times on air, but it's always important to read it again, because that's what this system is.
[01:09:39.926 --> 01:09:45.173]  The UN is a corporate, piratical receivership arm to take over this planet.
[01:09:45.193 --> 01:09:48.357]  We're going to continue to cover the latest developments in the economy.
[01:09:48.877 --> 01:09:55.083]  The TSA, the police state, Globalist bid to ban cars as part of Planned Opelous agenda.
[01:09:55.123 --> 01:10:05.473]  BBC reports UK rejects EU call for city centre ban on petrol cars, but the EU is going ahead with it, saying that their parliament is under their control.
[01:10:06.354 --> 01:10:07.394]  This is their goal.
[01:10:07.614 --> 01:10:08.955]  A post-industrial world.
[01:10:09.375 --> 01:10:10.816]  Shutting down civilization.
[01:10:11.196 --> 01:10:13.777]  The bankers are waging war against the real economy.
[01:10:14.117 --> 01:10:15.117]  Against real wealth.
[01:10:15.157 --> 01:10:18.138]  They want you as destitute people they can control.
[01:10:18.158 --> 01:10:19.178]  Let's go back to your calls.
[01:10:19.558 --> 01:10:21.159]  Victoria in Montana.
[01:10:21.539 --> 01:10:22.940]  Victoria, you're on the air.
[01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:23.380]  Welcome.
[01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:24.740]  Thank you.
[01:10:25.821 --> 01:10:35.764]  What I wanted to say was I think that the main reason why the Federal Reserve is trying to enslave the people of the world is because they know that they get their power
[01:10:36.255 --> 01:10:49.104]  and money from the United States mostly and in 2012 their contract expires that Woodrow Wilson signed into law in 1913 selling us down the river as a country and they know.
[01:10:49.184 --> 01:10:49.605]  That's right.
[01:10:49.765 --> 01:10:50.285]  Let me stop you.
[01:10:50.305 --> 01:10:51.246]  It's totally key.
[01:10:51.286 --> 01:10:59.471]  The Federal Reserve hundred-year anniversary is coming up in just about a year from now of course in 1913
[01:11:02.193 --> 01:11:10.599]  And they know that that is basically running out at the end of 2012 in about a year and three quarters.
[01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:12.320]  They know that's coming to an end.
[01:11:12.340 --> 01:11:18.505]  That's why they've set up Bretton Woods, too, with George Soros running it, openly announcing that they want to get rid of the dollar.
[01:11:18.865 --> 01:11:24.769]  And then the dollar is the only thing we have left in this fiat system to keep buying all the international goods we need.
[01:11:25.089 --> 01:11:27.071]  And if folks think the Depression's bad now and
[01:11:27.951 --> 01:11:30.275]  44 million Americans on food stamps is bad now.
[01:11:30.635 --> 01:11:31.777]  They haven't seen anything yet.
[01:11:31.817 --> 01:11:40.689]  These globalists have got us completely, like a boa constrictor captures a little piglet, wrapped up in their coils and we've got to get out of it.
[01:11:40.729 --> 01:11:41.109]  Go ahead.
[01:11:42.051 --> 01:11:44.314]  That's right and they know that the American people
[01:11:44.730 --> 01:11:45.371]  We're good to go.
[01:11:58.134 --> 01:12:05.019]  So they can keep their control over the whole planet, and that's why they're attacking, like you said, these... And by the way, they're openly announcing that everywhere.
[01:12:05.039 --> 01:12:07.501]  They're admitting world government, run by private bankers.
[01:12:07.801 --> 01:12:10.663]  You'll pay all these excise taxes.
[01:12:11.063 --> 01:12:14.486]  You'll pay national sales taxes, VAT.
[01:12:15.106 --> 01:12:18.529]  You'll pay carbon taxes to the private crooks.
[01:12:18.609 --> 01:12:25.414]  I mean, it's so incredible how naked it is, how ridiculously corrupt and fraudulent.
[01:12:27.217 --> 01:12:29.559]  And if we just get the word out, they're going to fail.
[01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:31.060]  That's right.
[01:12:31.201 --> 01:12:31.581]  That's right.
[01:12:31.621 --> 01:12:39.507]  Because they're nothing but a bunch of parasitical criminals that feeds off, you know, honest people that work and do what's right.
[01:12:39.587 --> 01:12:43.290]  And the United Nations, they're nothing but criminals that attack people.
[01:12:43.370 --> 01:12:47.554]  And I just don't... Well, look, the UN gets caught running white slavery rings worldwide.
[01:12:47.594 --> 01:12:50.456]  Every time I say white slavery, I get emails saying, what about black slavery?
[01:12:50.716 --> 01:12:52.598]  Folks, white slavery is sexual slavery.
[01:12:53.018 --> 01:12:54.098]  Okay, sex slaves.
[01:12:54.438 --> 01:13:09.683]  The UN, it isn't about color, has been caught, every country they're in doing it, loading the little kids and women up that are kidnapped on jets, flying them to Saudi Arabia, Israel's big into it, Indonesia, a bunch of other countries are involved in it, Thailand.
[01:13:09.703 --> 01:13:16.045]  I mean, these people have gotten away with murder, with the most wicked things you can imagine, DynCorp, Halliburton.
[01:13:16.425 --> 01:13:18.466]  Chicago Tribune, white slavery rings.
[01:13:18.867 --> 01:13:22.249]  Everywhere the UN goes, they're caught murdering, massacring, torturing.
[01:13:22.649 --> 01:13:26.472]  I mean, their armies are just an army of murderous trash.
[01:13:26.972 --> 01:13:31.655]  I mean, it is the most wicked, quasi-mercenary group you can imagine.
[01:13:31.675 --> 01:13:33.536]  The UN sent into Africa routinely.
[01:13:33.937 --> 01:13:42.883]  If some African nation tries to mine their own diamonds, they call them blood diamonds and make movies about how horrible it is if it isn't part of the De Beers-Oppenheimer monopoly.
[01:13:43.203 --> 01:13:46.005]  And they send in UN troops to bomb and slaughter everyone.
[01:13:46.465 --> 01:13:48.286]  I mean, they send in French troops.
[01:13:48.746 --> 01:13:52.568]  I mean, it's private mega-banks that run our armies.
[01:13:53.128 --> 01:13:53.968]  It's very simple.
[01:13:54.788 --> 01:13:59.250]  And now they're signing the deals, they're official, to use foreign troops in America.
[01:14:00.051 --> 01:14:04.873]  AP, Ottawa Citizen, Pentagon press releases, FEMA press releases.
[01:14:05.213 --> 01:14:06.873]  We show them here, we cover them.
[01:14:07.774 --> 01:14:12.416]  And it's so huge, it's so over the top, people don't even know how to respond, Victoria.
[01:14:12.656 --> 01:14:13.156]  Anything else?
[01:14:14.268 --> 01:14:15.008]  It's just terrible.
[01:14:15.028 --> 01:14:21.771]  What I think is that we need to bring all of our troops home, and we need to make Ron Paul president so we can get our country back.
[01:14:22.071 --> 01:14:22.531]  Exactly.
[01:14:22.571 --> 01:14:23.291]  I appreciate your call.
[01:14:23.331 --> 01:14:25.632]  And what they're doing is setting the precedent.
[01:14:25.712 --> 01:14:28.093]  First, oh, we don't declare war anymore, even though that's illegal.
[01:14:28.413 --> 01:14:30.674]  Then, oh, we get at least a resolution for force.
[01:14:30.954 --> 01:14:31.875]  Now we don't do that.
[01:14:32.195 --> 01:14:34.656]  Now the president says, Lord, you in.
[01:14:34.696 --> 01:14:35.296]  What do I do?
[01:14:35.456 --> 01:14:35.996]  You attack.
[01:14:36.376 --> 01:14:36.916]  Yes, sir.
[01:14:37.337 --> 01:14:37.717]  Boom.
[01:14:37.857 --> 01:14:38.637]  Launch the attack.
[01:14:40.498 --> 01:14:40.758]  Boom.
[01:14:42.884 --> 01:14:44.485]  I mean, world government is here.
[01:14:45.606 --> 01:14:49.389]  The World Trade Organization has all the power now over our trade.
[01:14:49.770 --> 01:14:50.931]  Congress just signed it away.
[01:14:53.168 --> 01:15:06.732]  The Congress is just a bunch of crooks, by and large, collecting big payoffs, and their wives and husbands and children, you know, get half-million-dollar-a-year salaries at the defense contractors, you know, that they sit on the committees for to get them the money.
[01:15:06.792 --> 01:15:13.975]  I mean, it's just wall-to-wall corruption, bankrupting everything, because that's towards the endgame to make the money while they're bankrupting us.
[01:15:14.255 --> 01:15:20.677]  Then once they bankrupt us, they hold us hostage and say, we're going to raise your taxes, you're going to live under austerity, it's for the earth,
[01:15:21.397 --> 01:15:22.618]  Everything goes to us now.
[01:15:22.798 --> 01:15:30.201]  And then they use the bankruptcy as a way to bring the country into receivership, just like Germany at the end of World War I, the Versailles Treaty.
[01:15:31.462 --> 01:15:33.563]  Stephen in North Carolina, you're on the air.
[01:15:34.944 --> 01:15:35.784]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:15:35.804 --> 01:15:36.344]  How are you doing?
[01:15:36.504 --> 01:15:37.205]  I'm doing all right.
[01:15:38.805 --> 01:15:42.867]  I just wanted to make a quick statement, and then I had a question for you, if that would be all right.
[01:15:42.948 --> 01:15:43.168]  Yes.
[01:15:43.188 --> 01:15:45.889]  I just want to say,
[01:15:46.443 --> 01:15:58.749]  Anyone that supports this military action in Libya has got to be out of their mind, because if they think, if one day we should finally get up the nerve to stand up against our federal government, do they think the UN is going to come in and back us up to overthrow them?
[01:15:59.050 --> 01:15:59.990]  Absolutely not.
[01:16:00.530 --> 01:16:09.055]  That was my statement, and I was just wondering, worst case scenario, the nuclear power plant in Japan is to melt down and it completely, you know,
[01:16:09.864 --> 01:16:11.045]  Well, what do you think?
[01:16:28.755 --> 01:16:30.797]  The endgame, would it be over here in America?
[01:16:30.837 --> 01:16:34.401]  What do you think the government is going to do with all the radiation and everything else coming this way?
[01:16:34.421 --> 01:16:41.188]  Are they going to continue to whitewash it, or are they going to eventually admit, yes, you know... No, they're telling us eat seafood out of the Pacific.
[01:16:41.569 --> 01:16:45.893]  They're saying, yeah, some radiation detectors are showing higher levels all over the U.S., even Europe.
[01:16:46.274 --> 01:16:46.674]  So what?
[01:16:46.714 --> 01:16:47.675]  It's not bad for you.
[01:16:48.636 --> 01:16:50.797]  And a lot of people are saying, well, this is a globalist plan.
[01:16:51.238 --> 01:16:53.879]  They might have blown up, you know, the first reactor or something.
[01:16:54.699 --> 01:16:56.200]  No, it was the tsunami and earthquake, folks.
[01:16:56.701 --> 01:17:00.163]  As a way to shut down nuclear power, just like they want to shut down coal.
[01:17:00.583 --> 01:17:07.967]  No, the globalists are clearly signifying, and they're big fake environmentalist groups, that they want to shut down coal, because that's not controlled by the big oil companies.
[01:17:08.027 --> 01:17:09.048]  They're owned by the big banks.
[01:17:09.608 --> 01:17:12.850]  And they're going to go ahead with more nuclear reactors, not less.
[01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:22.834]  And so I just see him whitewashing the whole thing, and it's just like the 300-plus above-ground, 500-plus with all countries involved, but 300-plus with the U.S.
[01:17:22.894 --> 01:17:24.854]  alone, above-ground nuclear test.
[01:17:24.914 --> 01:17:26.255]  So what if cancer rates go up?
[01:17:26.575 --> 01:17:27.936]  So what if fertility goes down?
[01:17:28.516 --> 01:17:37.299]  Remember, the globalists mine phosphate for fertilizer production out of limestone deposits that have different radioactive isotopes in it.
[01:17:37.679 --> 01:17:38.700]  It's where they also mine
[01:17:39.620 --> 01:17:43.242]  For uranium, and they put that in your water and call it sodium fluoride.
[01:17:43.762 --> 01:18:07.316]  So, remember when I had Dr. Busby on, and he said, many of my colleagues, of course he's a top chemical physicist, top radiation expert in its effects, he said, yes, many of my colleagues actually believe this is on purpose, because the sperm count has dropped by 87% in fertility, radioactive isotopes are key to reducing fertility, I just don't know, but it doesn't matter.
[01:18:07.856 --> 01:18:17.363]  The fact is, fertility in every region where nuclear power is used, and where nuclear systems are official material, is purified.
[01:18:17.503 --> 01:18:19.685]  Fertility is dropping regardless.
[01:18:20.045 --> 01:18:22.527]  It is destroying the human species.
[01:18:23.227 --> 01:18:28.431]  Then you have a eugenicist like Mombiot running around saying, more reactors, build them everywhere.
[01:18:28.511 --> 01:18:29.131]  Oh, I love it!
[01:18:29.752 --> 01:18:30.913]  Fluoride in the water, you know.
[01:18:32.427 --> 01:18:32.727]  This is
[01:18:52.659 --> 01:18:54.240]  Different radioactive isotopes.
[01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:55.982]  And I showed the mainstream news articles again.
[01:18:56.002 --> 01:18:59.985]  They just calmly go, yeah, the government covered up radiation in your water at high levels.
[01:19:01.066 --> 01:19:02.487]  They don't say why they covered it up.
[01:19:02.527 --> 01:19:04.148]  And no one asked, why is it there?
[01:19:05.049 --> 01:19:07.551]  It's just, it's there and it's not going to stop.
[01:19:07.591 --> 01:19:08.632]  We're just letting you know now.
[01:19:09.432 --> 01:19:11.734]  And yes, cell phones give you brain cancer, but aren't they fun?
[01:19:11.754 --> 01:19:13.195]  Go ahead and give them to your kids.
[01:19:13.876 --> 01:19:15.117]  Does that answer your question, my friend?
[01:19:16.538 --> 01:19:17.279]  Yes, it does.
[01:19:17.599 --> 01:19:21.242]  So in the grand scheme of things, this plays into world depopulation and eugenics.
[01:19:22.316 --> 01:19:23.057]  Absolutely.
[01:19:24.078 --> 01:19:31.544]  It plays into the fact that the globalists have a spirit of death and destruction, like their father, and this is what they do.
[01:19:32.065 --> 01:19:36.969]  I mean, you can ascribe to it whatever reason you think they're doing it, but they're doing it.
[01:19:37.410 --> 01:19:44.256]  No one can deny, debate, that these people, until 1991, wouldn't let troops use DU, now they use it everywhere.
[01:19:44.937 --> 01:19:46.998]  It ignites when they fire it out the end of the barrel.
[01:19:47.739 --> 01:19:54.702]  The troops are getting deadly dosages of it that will reduce their lifespan by decades every time they fire a DE round and they don't care.
[01:19:55.182 --> 01:19:56.763]  What does that tell you about the New World Order?
[01:19:58.084 --> 01:19:59.024]  Okay, what does that tell you?
[01:20:00.922 --> 01:20:03.484]  If you suffer from poor sleep, you need MyPillow.
[01:20:03.905 --> 01:20:06.607]  Guaranteed to be the most comfortable pillow you will ever own.

[01:20:58.886 --> 01:20:59.606]  Guaranteed.

[01:21:02.907 --> 01:21:05.088]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:21:05.108 --> 01:21:07.949]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:21:08.429 --> 01:21:13.171]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:21:13.531 --> 01:21:17.712]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:21:18.032 --> 01:21:20.375]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:21:20.395 --> 01:21:22.919]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:21:23.279 --> 01:21:25.842]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:21:26.183 --> 01:21:33.793]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:21:34.133 --> 01:21:39.397]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:21:39.497 --> 01:21:41.799]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:21:41.839 --> 01:21:45.802]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:21:46.062 --> 01:21:46.982]  And I got news for you.
[01:21:47.122 --> 01:21:48.423]  You're everyone else.
[01:21:48.463 --> 01:21:49.584]  Invisible Empire.

[01:22:29.131 --> 01:22:30.192]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:30.372 --> 01:22:34.755]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:22:34.935 --> 01:22:40.639]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:22:40.739 --> 01:22:44.161]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:22:44.381 --> 01:22:46.983]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:47.103 --> 01:22:52.006]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:22:52.166 --> 01:22:52.387]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:52.407 --> 01:22:53.808]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:59.451 --> 01:23:01.212]  Daddy, I'm hungry.
[01:23:01.532 --> 01:23:02.713]  That little girl will get fed.
[01:23:03.053 --> 01:23:03.413]  For now.
[01:23:03.854 --> 01:23:06.575]  But what if people like Glenn Beck are right about the threats we face?
[01:23:06.975 --> 01:23:07.496]  If the U.S.
[01:23:07.516 --> 01:23:12.598]  dollar loses its status as the global reserve currency, prices on the things you need most will skyrocket.
[01:23:12.999 --> 01:23:15.340]  Food may be unaffordable, or worse, unavailable.
[01:23:15.740 --> 01:23:26.423]  Earthquakes, economic turmoil, continuing unemployment, rampant inflation, and even threats of terrorism are all reasons to let the experts at Ready Reserve Foods help you with a long-term food storage plan.
[01:23:26.683 --> 01:23:31.344]  Ready Reserve Foods has been a premier supplier of long-term storage foods for 37 years.

[01:24:28.053 --> 01:24:29.554]  Okay, we are back live.
[01:24:29.614 --> 01:24:31.215]  Let's go right to your phone calls.
[01:24:31.615 --> 01:24:33.056]  Harry in Michigan.
[01:24:33.076 --> 01:24:34.096]  You're on the air, sir.
[01:24:34.116 --> 01:24:34.736]  Thank you for holding.
[01:24:36.557 --> 01:24:36.957]  Yeah, Alex.
[01:24:37.338 --> 01:24:37.658]  Yes, sir.
[01:24:38.678 --> 01:24:39.098]  Are you there?
[01:24:39.319 --> 01:24:39.499]  Hey.
[01:24:40.599 --> 01:24:42.400]  It's great to talk to you again, man.
[01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:44.321]  And thank you for all the work you're doing.
[01:24:44.441 --> 01:24:46.682]  And God bless you and keep up the good work.
[01:24:47.443 --> 01:24:52.026]  My first deal is that I have been a long time listener to you, probably 16 years.
[01:24:52.466 --> 01:24:53.507]  Thank you.
[01:24:53.827 --> 01:24:58.230]  I first heard you in Katy, Texas about 16, 17 years ago.
[01:24:59.972 --> 01:25:13.801]  My eyes have been open since about 1980 when I was taught at the Trilateral Commission in the United Nations where a bunch of scums suck in bottom feeders.
[01:25:15.692 --> 01:25:16.552]  I have been a pipefitter.
[01:25:16.572 --> 01:25:20.694]  I've been working on nuclear plants since about 1971 in the wilderness.
[01:25:21.614 --> 01:25:31.057]  And people in this country do not know the severity of what has happened over there in Japan and what's going on in this country.
[01:25:31.681 --> 01:25:32.821]  It's just making me sick.
[01:25:32.921 --> 01:25:49.608]  No, now they've set the precedent to have five reactors on fire, exploding, 600,000 spent fuel rods, open reactors with live uranium, plutonium, and off-gassing, blowing to the U.S., and our media's like, hey, this isn't bad for you, in fact, it's good for you.
[01:25:50.568 --> 01:25:51.169]  Well, yeah, Ms.
[01:25:51.269 --> 01:25:54.550]  Ann Coulter, I mean, this woman needs to be hung.
[01:25:54.997 --> 01:25:57.520]  I mean, what a lying piece of scum she is.
[01:25:57.640 --> 01:26:01.924]  And all these global scum are... This is a slow kill.
[01:26:02.545 --> 01:26:05.508]  And I see this coming across the United States and around the world.
[01:26:05.808 --> 01:26:08.231]  All I see is a slow kill down the road.
[01:26:08.972 --> 01:26:14.758]  And the more people you try to wake up to this... Luckily, I woke up three people so far this month.
[01:26:15.365 --> 01:26:16.166]  What's going on?
[01:26:16.526 --> 01:26:23.271]  Oh yeah, that's the exciting thing, and we gotta make lemonade out of lemons, is that people are ready to wake up now.
[01:26:23.371 --> 01:26:24.271]  We've got the truth.
[01:26:24.611 --> 01:26:25.512]  We've got the facts.
[01:26:25.532 --> 01:26:26.733]  The globalists don't admissions.
[01:26:27.393 --> 01:26:29.775]  A lot of people, tens of millions of people in the U.S.
[01:26:29.835 --> 01:26:34.398]  alone, remember myself and many others telling them the truth for decades.
[01:26:34.999 --> 01:26:36.560]  Now they see it all coming true.
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.721]  Our credibility continues to rise.
[01:26:39.862 --> 01:26:40.382]  Exactly.
[01:26:41.673 --> 01:26:41.993]  Yes, sir.
[01:27:00.194 --> 01:27:03.555]  I mean, people come up to me and say, you know, how did you know this?
[01:27:03.955 --> 01:27:05.775]  And I say, well, you've got to be informed.
[01:27:06.176 --> 01:27:07.696]  You people have got to wake up.
[01:27:07.756 --> 01:27:08.316]  You're sheep.
[01:27:08.856 --> 01:27:11.877]  Listen to the Alex Jones Show, InfoWars, Prison Planet.
[01:27:11.937 --> 01:27:20.819]  Well, by the way, Harry, and spreading the word is key now because folks are again finally ready to be awakened because the facts are now in their face, not over the next hill.
[01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:23.020]  We haven't even pointed out.
[01:27:24.181 --> 01:27:25.602]  And I got an email about this last night.
[01:27:25.622 --> 01:27:26.363]  It makes a lot of sense.
[01:27:26.763 --> 01:27:30.565]  I mean, I don't want to say this was an inside job, but maybe 11s are unlucky.
[01:27:31.206 --> 01:27:33.527]  You had the 7-7 attack.
[01:27:33.587 --> 01:27:36.269]  You had the 3-11 attack in Madrid.
[01:27:37.030 --> 01:27:39.691]  We've had all these other 11 attacks, 9-11.
[01:27:40.752 --> 01:27:48.517]  You notice it was 3-11-11, 3-11-11, when this Japanese earthquake tsunami happened.
[01:27:49.038 --> 01:27:52.300]  I tell you, folks, that is really strange, isn't it?
[01:27:53.328 --> 01:28:00.589]  Yes it is, Alex, and it all falls back to these globalist beliefs and their religion and the numerology involved in this.
[01:28:00.969 --> 01:28:03.750]  Well, I remember a lady calling me last year on air.
[01:28:04.330 --> 01:28:05.990]  When I saw this email, I remember the call.
[01:28:06.010 --> 01:28:08.431]  She goes, Alex, you've got to listen to me.
[01:28:08.451 --> 01:28:08.831]  3-11-11.
[01:28:09.091 --> 01:28:10.031]  They're going to hit.
[01:28:10.491 --> 01:28:12.031]  You know, there's going to be earthquakes.
[01:28:12.071 --> 01:28:13.592]  And I'm like, OK, thank you, ma'am.
[01:28:14.052 --> 01:28:15.772]  I guess she must have been psychic or something.
[01:28:17.152 --> 01:28:20.593]  I mean, I don't get into things that we can't prove, but that is a little weird, isn't it?
[01:28:21.756 --> 01:28:22.837]  It most certainly is.
[01:28:23.177 --> 01:28:30.543]  You know, I'm beginning to believe that they do work in this number system, 9-11.
[01:28:30.563 --> 01:28:36.408]  Their belief system, it's definitely a Luciferian belief system that they're in.
[01:28:37.669 --> 01:28:38.750]  This has got to stop.
[01:28:38.770 --> 01:28:40.972]  The American people have got to make a stand.
[01:28:41.032 --> 01:28:42.953]  They've got to draw that line in the sand.
[01:28:42.973 --> 01:28:46.136]  Like Travis said, we've got to stand up and fight these people.
[01:28:46.596 --> 01:28:48.378]  And it's my passion for years.
[01:28:48.914 --> 01:28:52.556]  I'm being laughed at and scorned that this day was going to happen.
[01:28:53.096 --> 01:28:53.756]  Absolutely.
[01:28:53.776 --> 01:29:06.581]  Harry, it's beautiful that you were listening in Texas, must have been 98-9, 16, 17, 16 and a half years ago, and imagine the tens of millions of others.
[01:29:06.681 --> 01:29:12.464]  I've done thousands of radio interviews, hundreds and hundreds of TV interviews, internationally and nationally.
[01:29:13.064 --> 01:29:18.828]  I have, you know, we've put out thousands and thousands of stories, 25 plus films, thousands of videos.
[01:29:19.348 --> 01:29:31.076]  Think about that woodpecker effect of just doing it over and over and over again, and all those millions and millions and millions, really hundreds of millions, that have heard the information I've put out, doggedly.
[01:29:31.636 --> 01:29:33.477]  Steadfastly, and the effect it's had.
[01:29:33.537 --> 01:29:38.520]  And think of all the people you personally warned, and all of the other listeners warned, who got laughed at.
[01:29:38.841 --> 01:29:43.984]  The hundreds of millions you got to worldwide, and now the globalists can see the growth curve.
[01:29:44.324 --> 01:29:46.085]  They can see how fast we're waking up.
[01:29:46.445 --> 01:29:50.127]  So they're going to implode economies, start wars, stage terror attacks, you name it.
[01:29:50.368 --> 01:29:51.288]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.769 --> 01:29:53.369]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.290 --> 01:29:56.972]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.838 --> 01:30:03.580]  And you're subject to other police action.
[01:30:04.401 --> 01:30:05.322]  Tyranny is here.
[01:30:05.662 --> 01:30:09.366]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:30:09.546 --> 01:30:11.808]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:30:11.828 --> 01:30:17.274]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:30:17.714 --> 01:30:23.941]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:30:24.361 --> 01:30:29.883]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:30:30.344 --> 01:30:33.985]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:30:34.525 --> 01:30:38.507]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:30:38.807 --> 01:30:44.309]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:30:44.749 --> 01:30:47.731]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:30:48.311 --> 01:30:49.731]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:30:50.272 --> 01:30:50.712]  It's here.

[01:31:24.143 --> 01:31:30.369]  Since 1947, Calvin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.

[01:31:52.526 --> 01:31:53.347]  Thank you!
[01:31:59.738 --> 01:32:03.961]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:32:04.282 --> 01:32:04.882]  Number 1.
[01:32:05.202 --> 01:32:08.345]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:08.625 --> 01:32:09.185]  Number 2.
[01:32:09.486 --> 01:32:14.049]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:14.389 --> 01:32:14.830]  It's true.
[01:32:15.130 --> 01:32:19.673]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:19.994 --> 01:32:20.534]  Number 3.
[01:32:20.814 --> 01:32:24.097]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:24.397 --> 01:32:28.100]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:28.300 --> 01:32:28.841]  Number 4.
[01:32:29.101 --> 01:32:31.463]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:31.864 --> 01:32:35.247]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:32:35.548 --> 01:32:35.748]  Number 5.
[01:32:36.328 --> 01:32:40.253]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:32:40.473 --> 01:32:45.238]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:32:45.518 --> 01:32:49.543]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:49.703 --> 01:32:51.265]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:51.485 --> 01:32:53.568]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:32:53.748 --> 01:32:56.091]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:33:11.832 --> 01:33:14.853]  You can run on for a long time.
[01:33:15.513 --> 01:33:17.754]  Run on for a long time.
[01:33:18.454 --> 01:33:20.575]  Run on for a long time.
[01:33:21.295 --> 01:33:23.696]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[01:33:24.276 --> 01:33:26.717]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[01:33:26.797 --> 01:33:32.699]  We are in the clutches of the globalists.
[01:33:33.059 --> 01:33:34.900]  And they are ruthless.
[01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:36.640]  They know how to socially engineer.
[01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:37.721]  They know how to manipulate.
[01:33:37.761 --> 01:33:38.561]  They know how to lie.
[01:33:39.943 --> 01:33:49.742]  But no matter how sophisticated they are, if you're aware of their program, which is very simple overall, their manipulation is complex, it's all over for them.
[01:33:51.243 --> 01:33:55.105]  And it doesn't work anymore for them to just call us conspiracy theorists.
[01:33:55.765 --> 01:33:59.867]  It doesn't work anymore when you say, I don't trust the government raising my taxes.
[01:34:00.008 --> 01:34:02.769]  I don't like what the foreign banks are doing, not seeing where the trillions went.
[01:34:03.189 --> 01:34:08.752]  I don't like the TSA violating states' rights, setting up checkpoints, not just in airports, but all over highways.
[01:34:09.232 --> 01:34:13.274]  I don't like these foreign troop agreements to use troops in our country.
[01:34:13.414 --> 01:34:19.978]  I don't like the UN telling our president what to do, and him in a servile fashion going along with it, and Congress illegally
[01:34:20.458 --> 01:34:22.120]  Because Congress is now involved in treason.
[01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:29.106]  Every member of Congress, other than Ron Paul, Rand Paul, the Senator, and a few Democrats, other than them, are engaged.
[01:34:29.126 --> 01:34:30.167]  They should all be impeached.
[01:34:30.228 --> 01:34:33.711]  I'm calling for the whole Congress, who's laying there doing nothing, to be impeached.
[01:34:33.991 --> 01:34:35.593]  They're all part of this treason.
[01:34:36.133 --> 01:34:37.394]  They don't use treason lightly.
[01:34:37.715 --> 01:34:42.419]  Signing the North American Union Agreement six years ago in secret, and then it came out two years later.
[01:34:43.180 --> 01:34:45.624]  To have corporations telling our governments what to do?
[01:34:46.225 --> 01:34:51.252]  Wanting to set up toll roads on 84 interstate highways to fund the new North American Union?
[01:34:52.454 --> 01:34:53.596]  Congress not involved?
[01:34:55.939 --> 01:34:58.280]  And still, they're following North American integration?
[01:34:58.921 --> 01:35:00.241]  I mean, it's all going on.
[01:35:00.681 --> 01:35:02.762]  Again, 2007, four years ago.
[01:35:03.483 --> 01:35:07.445]  You can just go to YouTube and type in, 50-year anniversary of EU celebrations.
[01:35:07.485 --> 01:35:08.505]  In fact, let's just do it ourselves.
[01:35:08.525 --> 01:35:12.647]  50-year, show a news headline, it'll show photos.
[01:35:12.667 --> 01:35:13.988]  50-year anniversary of the EU.
[01:35:14.488 --> 01:35:16.669]  How did they have a 50th anniversary in 2007?
[01:35:16.850 --> 01:35:18.290]  The EU, we're all told, started in 2000.
[01:35:18.330 --> 01:35:19.811]  15 members, then 20, then 25.
[01:35:26.010 --> 01:35:37.058]  Countries being gobbled up by this criminal organization, so they could then be bankrupted and put into receivership, and then the richer European nations would, quote, bail them out, meaning paying the bankers their loan-sharking rates.
[01:35:38.339 --> 01:35:39.680]  How did they have a 50th anniversary?
[01:35:39.880 --> 01:35:54.190]  Because the Treaty of Rome, as I show and cover in Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, and the EU and the UN brag about this, the Treaty of Rome, 1957, established the European Union under a trade deal like NAFTA and GATT.
[01:35:54.994 --> 01:35:56.675]  We're in the North American Union.
[01:35:57.396 --> 01:35:58.156]  It's treason!
[01:35:58.897 --> 01:35:59.938]  Real treason!
[01:36:00.318 --> 01:36:01.959]  I don't just use that word lightly.
[01:36:03.420 --> 01:36:05.502]  Systemic treason.
[01:36:06.943 --> 01:36:19.652]  These private corporations set up international bodies, and then have Congress and the legislatures, who are under- First the Feds take over the states, then the Feds sign over to the foreign banks, and they run the planet.
[01:36:21.614 --> 01:36:22.835]  And Congress does what they're told.
[01:36:22.855 --> 01:36:24.336]  Because they're bought and paid for.
[01:36:27.318 --> 01:36:34.330]  Now there's a headline, the European Union celebrates its 50th anniversary on the 25th of April 2007.
[01:36:34.390 --> 01:36:36.694]  You notice the 25th of April is when they ratified the Treaty of Rome.
[01:36:41.820 --> 01:37:00.845]  And they say, 50 years ago, the leaders of six European countries, Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Italy, and the Netherlands, signed the Treaties of Rome, which established the modern-day European Union, co-cooperation, which started with the coal and steel, and has become an unprecedented success in creating a political and economic union between 27 member states.
[01:37:02.065 --> 01:37:03.766]  First 15, then 25, then 27, and growing.
[01:37:06.311 --> 01:37:09.893]  What publication was that from, or was that an actual EU press release?
[01:37:10.734 --> 01:37:11.775]  Press release by the EU.
[01:37:12.435 --> 01:37:17.698]  And by the way, all over Europe, no one came out to the lavish taxpayer-funded parades and fireworks displays.
[01:37:18.579 --> 01:37:21.961]  There were just police blocking the barricades and almost no one out there.
[01:37:22.581 --> 01:37:23.882]  The few that were there were booing it.
[01:37:23.902 --> 01:37:27.445]  Kind of like the French when the Nazis came into Paris, they turned their backs on them.
[01:37:28.986 --> 01:37:29.886]  Couldn't arrest them all.
[01:37:31.547 --> 01:37:32.328]  They don't care!
[01:37:33.288 --> 01:37:33.508]  Okay?
[01:37:34.577 --> 01:37:38.526]  And if they win, down the road they'll announce the anniversary of the North American Union.
[01:37:39.088 --> 01:37:39.930]  They may say it was 1994.
[01:37:43.393 --> 01:37:44.113]  NAFTA and GATT.
[01:37:44.213 --> 01:37:47.614]  They may say it was 2005 with the SPP signing.
[01:37:48.255 --> 01:37:49.775]  The point is they say we're now in it.
[01:37:50.015 --> 01:37:51.856]  You understand I'm not just saying this.
[01:37:52.236 --> 01:38:10.882]  I tell high-powered reporters from Nightline and Rolling Stone and New York Magazine and Wall Street Journal, when they come here, I go, can I give you the actual global documents from the UN, from the IMF, can I show you where David Rockefeller says that he's guilty as charged, wanting a world government?
[01:38:11.786 --> 01:38:15.869]  Can I show you a New York Times article with David Rockefeller praising Mao Zedong?
[01:38:16.910 --> 01:38:18.411]  And they say, no, I don't want to look at it.
[01:38:18.831 --> 01:38:19.592]  This is your opinion.
[01:38:20.032 --> 01:38:22.614]  And they go write articles that I'm crazy making this stuff up.
[01:38:23.434 --> 01:38:23.715]  Okay.
[01:38:24.455 --> 01:38:24.876]  I'm crazy.
[01:38:27.357 --> 01:38:28.838]  This is from David Rockefeller's book.
[01:38:28.878 --> 01:38:30.360]  In fact, we'll put it back up on screen.
[01:38:30.380 --> 01:38:31.100]  I forget the title.
[01:38:31.140 --> 01:38:31.941]  What's the title of the book?
[01:38:33.078 --> 01:38:33.398]  I own it.
[01:38:33.478 --> 01:38:34.018]  Oh, here it is!
[01:38:34.198 --> 01:38:34.498]  Here it is!
[01:38:34.538 --> 01:38:34.979]  They got it!
[01:38:35.559 --> 01:38:35.859]  Here it is!
[01:38:35.919 --> 01:38:37.439]  I can show folks watching PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:38:37.459 --> 01:38:39.680]  We've got bookshelf after bookshelf out there.
[01:38:39.700 --> 01:38:43.921]  David Rockefeller memoirs with an afterword by the author.
[01:38:44.881 --> 01:38:49.042]  This is his authorized New York Times bestseller, uh, that what came out in 2005.
[01:38:49.382 --> 01:39:00.245]  Let me even check the publication date to be absolutely precise and test my memory, which is... Excuse me!
[01:39:01.426 --> 01:39:02.006]  Excuse me!
[01:39:03.912 --> 01:39:09.499]  First published in 2002, and then I got it with a reprint in 2004.
[01:39:09.999 --> 01:39:17.528]  And this is in memory of Abby Aldrich Rockefeller and my wife, Peggy Rockefeller.
[01:39:18.208 --> 01:39:22.673]  And it's bookmarked here in the book, because the press likes to roll their eyes.
[01:39:23.905 --> 01:39:24.866]  And I show this to them.
[01:39:25.447 --> 01:39:26.989]  Proud internationalist.
[01:39:27.430 --> 01:39:31.895]  That means not international brotherhood, but that means bankers.
[01:39:32.076 --> 01:39:37.823]  And here's quotes where he says, I want international bankers to run things versus free states.
[01:39:39.073 --> 01:40:06.076]  and uh... we have the quote here some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interest of the united states characterizing my family and me as internationalist and conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure one world if you will if that's the charge i stand guilty and i am proud of it they've got all these low-level camp followers uh... who run around and
[01:40:08.306 --> 01:40:11.047]  say that, oh, it's about brotherhood and peace.
[01:40:11.127 --> 01:40:13.828]  Yeah, you see the peace of the UN and the bankers.
[01:40:15.229 --> 01:40:18.410]  I mean, I've seen top globalists in the EU bragging in major newspapers.
[01:40:18.970 --> 01:40:19.871]  We've read the quotes here.
[01:40:21.371 --> 01:40:23.492]  Where, in fact, you can even search the term.
[01:40:24.533 --> 01:40:31.796]  Founders of EU admit that it is a takeover arm for sovereign states for bankers.
[01:40:32.516 --> 01:40:36.898]  I mean, they just brag, thinking you're stupid and you don't read their own books they write.
[01:40:37.927 --> 01:40:39.648]  In fact, I actually found it out of the book itself.
[01:40:42.128 --> 01:40:42.989]  Here's the full quote.
[01:40:43.129 --> 01:40:47.450]  In fact, zoom in on this so folks will actually see it out of the book if they're watching on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:40:48.011 --> 01:40:48.651]  Right here on page 405.
[01:40:50.932 --> 01:40:52.112]  Populist paranoia.
[01:40:52.452 --> 01:40:55.013]  Now he goes on here to say we're paranoid because we don't like this.
[01:40:55.073 --> 01:40:56.734]  See, this is what globalists do.
[01:40:58.994 --> 01:40:59.875]  Then we're going back to your calls.
[01:41:00.495 --> 01:41:05.977]  They admit they're setting up world government, but then if you don't like it, you're insane and it doesn't exist.
[01:41:06.949 --> 01:41:12.372]  And he shows this arrogant mind control spin in this full paragraph.
[01:41:12.392 --> 01:41:23.377]  He says, for more than a century, ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum, folks that don't want to be slaves to unelected foreign bureaucracies created by private banks.
[01:41:24.017 --> 01:41:25.117]  I'm sorry, I'm interrupting him.
[01:41:25.538 --> 01:41:26.338]  Let me just read his quote here.
[01:41:28.444 --> 01:41:44.894]  For more than a century, ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum have seized upon well-publicized incidents such as my encounter with Castro to attack the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over American political and economic institutions.
[01:41:45.794 --> 01:41:46.254]  Let me see.
[01:41:46.795 --> 01:41:57.701]  I've seen Rockefeller on C-SPAN with world leaders introducing him saying he set up the world order with his family, donated the land for the UN, and founded every major private globalist organization in every major country.
[01:41:58.162 --> 01:41:59.983]  And they have constant meetings to coordinate it.
[01:42:01.043 --> 01:42:02.404]  But, oh, he's not involved in that.
[01:42:03.084 --> 01:42:03.585]  Continuing.
[01:42:03.785 --> 01:42:07.767]  Some even believe we're part of a secret cabal working against the best interest of the United States.
[01:42:08.568 --> 01:42:10.349]  Well, look what's happening to the bankrupt republic.
[01:42:12.145 --> 01:42:19.791]  Characterizing my family and me as internationalist, and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure.
[01:42:19.911 --> 01:42:21.112]  One world, if you will.
[01:42:21.632 --> 01:42:23.634]  If that's the charge, I stand guilty.
[01:42:23.994 --> 01:42:24.634]  And I'm proud of it.
[01:42:25.495 --> 01:42:32.080]  The anti-Rockefeller focus of these otherwise incomparable political positions owes much to populism.
[01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:34.101]  Oh, that dirty, dirty thing.
[01:42:34.602 --> 01:42:36.223]  Populists believe in conspiracies.
[01:42:36.503 --> 01:42:37.984]  He just admitted he wants world government.
[01:42:38.985 --> 01:42:49.819]  And there's countless documents where they break down exactly how it's going to work, post-industrial, one-child policies, Rockefeller Foundation-funded papers on sterilants and vaccines.
[01:42:49.839 --> 01:42:51.881]  We've got all those documents on InfoWars.com.
[01:42:52.182 --> 01:42:55.626]  In case there's new viewers or listeners, type in...
[01:42:57.037 --> 01:43:08.145]  Rockefeller Foundation documents, uh, fund sterilants and vaccines, Rockefeller documents, uh, Rockefeller Foundation, sterilants and vaccines, InfoWars.com.
[01:43:08.325 --> 01:43:10.786]  And then you go, that's InfoWars.com.
[01:43:10.806 --> 01:43:12.127]  Now we have links to mainstream articles.
[01:43:12.227 --> 01:43:20.973]  And then the actual documents that we wrote last year in one month, one of our great writers, 10 different articles on it, 10, 10.
[01:43:24.631 --> 01:43:31.095]  Oh, but we're populist conspiracy theorists because we know how to go to major libraries and pull Rockefeller Foundation documents from 1966.
[01:43:31.195 --> 01:43:38.020]  And the UN was caught with the exact program they talked about, vaccinating people and sterilizing them.
[01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:38.500]  There it is.
[01:43:40.582 --> 01:43:44.524]  Rockefeller Foundation developed vaccines for mass scale fertility reduction.
[01:43:44.725 --> 01:43:45.765]  And then you scroll down.
[01:43:45.785 --> 01:43:48.747]  Oh, oh, what's on the site?
[01:43:49.348 --> 01:43:51.969]  Links to the actual PDFs.
[01:43:53.507 --> 01:43:55.048]  Oh, we know how to read.
[01:43:55.108 --> 01:43:56.588]  We're evil conspiracy theorists.
[01:43:56.608 --> 01:43:57.108]  Let me go back.
[01:43:58.249 --> 01:44:06.312]  The anti-Rockefeller focus of these otherwise incomparable... Who can comprehend people that know how to read their own documents?
[01:44:07.792 --> 01:44:13.334]  These anti-Rockefeller focus of these otherwise incomparable political positions owes much to populism.
[01:44:13.674 --> 01:44:15.815]  Populists believe in conspiracies.
[01:44:15.835 --> 01:44:18.356]  You mean in powerful people manipulating and wanting more power?
[01:44:19.016 --> 01:44:20.877]  You mean we believe in history and reality?
[01:44:21.417 --> 01:44:22.798]  Populists believe in conspiracies.
[01:44:23.338 --> 01:44:30.942]  And one of the most endearing is that a secret group of international bankers and capitalists and their minions control the world's economy.
[01:44:31.703 --> 01:44:39.787]  Because of my name and prominence at the head of Chase for many years, I have earned the distinction as a conspirator-in-chief from some of these people.
[01:44:40.447 --> 01:44:41.968]  Populist and isolationist.
[01:44:42.008 --> 01:44:42.968]  No, we're not isolationist.
[01:44:43.248 --> 01:44:46.730]  We don't like China having tariffs on us because you just moved your factories over there.
[01:44:47.070 --> 01:44:49.011]  We don't have tariffs on them.
[01:44:49.051 --> 01:44:56.314]  We don't like your insiders that wrote the health care bill all getting waivers for their companies to get health care, but I've got to buy it, even though my employees don't want it.
[01:44:58.515 --> 01:45:00.656]  We don't like your unfair trade advantage, punk.
[01:45:03.838 --> 01:45:04.658]  And it just goes on.
[01:45:08.072 --> 01:45:08.953]  All these are code words.
[01:45:09.514 --> 01:45:12.677]  All we want in the United States is a result of global trade.
[01:45:12.697 --> 01:45:14.759]  Oh, look how good that's been, so-called global trade.
[01:45:15.339 --> 01:45:18.763]  Improved communications, so we're de-industrialized, they're spying on all of us.
[01:45:19.183 --> 01:45:23.648]  And the heightened interaction of people from different cultures, bringing grip since we all fight with each other.
[01:45:24.028 --> 01:45:26.771]  Populists rarely mention these positive consequences.
[01:45:26.951 --> 01:45:27.372]  Oh, yes.
[01:45:28.012 --> 01:45:30.155]  It's like the positive consequences of gonorrhea.
[01:45:30.575 --> 01:45:31.276]  Nor can they
[01:45:32.881 --> 01:45:40.187]  Cogently explain, oh we can't do that, how they would have sustained American economic growth and the expansion of our political power without them.
[01:45:40.467 --> 01:45:45.310]  You mean your political power using the United States as your evil juggernaut.
[01:45:46.211 --> 01:45:52.836]  Again, oh boy, it is really hard to respond to this level of throwing it in your face.
[01:45:53.857 --> 01:45:54.918]  These people are tyrants.
[01:45:56.015 --> 01:46:10.001]  This is a man who in the New York Times, we went to the microfilm at UT and have an in-game, the date, everything, and praised Chinese control and what Mao did, and what do you see in the news all the time from the CFR that he helped set up with his father?
[01:46:11.041 --> 01:46:13.742]  How China's the model, how they're great, how they're not bad.
[01:46:14.082 --> 01:46:18.744]  What do Google and Yahoo do?
[01:46:20.985 --> 01:46:22.806]  What do the big telecommunications giants do?
[01:46:22.866 --> 01:46:23.366]  They help
[01:46:26.024 --> 01:46:31.248]  China, censor their people, and then our own government, and the Australian and British government, then come out with headlines.
[01:46:31.708 --> 01:46:34.350]  We're going to use the Chinese model of censorship.
[01:46:34.610 --> 01:46:35.110]  Pull that up.
[01:46:35.310 --> 01:46:36.811]  That was first in Australia three years ago.
[01:46:37.092 --> 01:46:37.532]  Headline.
[01:46:38.553 --> 01:46:39.133]  Just show everybody.
[01:46:39.173 --> 01:46:39.613]  Here on air.
[01:46:40.354 --> 01:46:41.234]  No, this is my opinion.
[01:46:41.254 --> 01:46:41.875]  It's all right here.
[01:46:42.455 --> 01:46:43.016]  I studied this.
[01:46:43.056 --> 01:46:43.636]  You can study it.
[01:46:43.996 --> 01:46:45.477]  That's what's so effective about this show.
[01:46:46.058 --> 01:46:46.318]  Boom.
[01:46:46.378 --> 01:46:46.898]  Show you everything.
[01:46:47.599 --> 01:46:48.379]  Tell you about Rockefeller?
[01:46:48.399 --> 01:46:48.920]  Show you his book.
[01:46:50.387 --> 01:46:51.668]  Tell you about the New York Times article?
[01:46:51.788 --> 01:46:53.449]  Tell you where you can look at it for free online.
[01:46:53.969 --> 01:46:55.110]  What is TheEndgame.com?
[01:46:55.190 --> 01:47:00.052]  Full bibliography of the film, every minute of the film, with a link and a time code and the links to the documents.
[01:47:00.733 --> 01:47:01.013]  Boom!
[01:47:01.773 --> 01:47:04.535]  Oh, I can't cogently break it down, Herr Rockefeller, huh?
[01:47:05.535 --> 01:47:06.176]  And what you've done?
[01:47:08.970 --> 01:47:09.311]  There it is.
[01:47:09.391 --> 01:47:12.233]  Australia to enforce mandatory Chinese-style internet censorship.
[01:47:12.253 --> 01:47:13.794]  Yeah, that's at InfoWars.com.
[01:47:14.475 --> 01:47:14.915]  Try it.
[01:47:15.075 --> 01:47:17.977]  I believe it was The Age and the Sydney Morning Herald had it.
[01:47:18.638 --> 01:47:19.579]  Go with their articles.
[01:47:19.939 --> 01:47:23.662]  Just say Australia implementing Chinese-style
[01:47:26.249 --> 01:47:26.589]  Web.
[01:47:27.170 --> 01:47:27.610]  That was it.
[01:47:28.110 --> 01:47:30.332]  Yeah, Harold's son, but the page not found.
[01:47:30.372 --> 01:47:32.934]  He found the link, but they've moved the page.
[01:47:33.394 --> 01:47:34.615]  Take me back to Google then.
[01:47:34.655 --> 01:47:39.578]  Let's show them that under that search term it did lead to the Australian news.
[01:47:40.138 --> 01:47:43.641]  Point is, you know this has all been announced, and our article will have quotes in it.
[01:47:43.781 --> 01:47:51.006]  That's why we write articles about stuff that's already in mainstream news so there's a record of it when they put it behind a wall or move it or get rid of it.
[01:47:51.606 --> 01:47:54.028]  So, but who can deny they're calling for internet kill switches?
[01:47:54.048 --> 01:47:54.548]  Who can deny?
[01:47:54.588 --> 01:47:55.329]  You know about that.
[01:47:56.934 --> 01:48:03.520]  Okay, let's go ahead now and talk to John in Michigan, then Kyle Keith, Richard Bluestar, and others.
[01:48:03.540 --> 01:48:04.181]  You're on the air.
[01:48:05.181 --> 01:48:06.102]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:48:06.242 --> 01:48:06.643]  Pretty good.
[01:48:07.444 --> 01:48:08.244]  Hey, two things.
[01:48:08.304 --> 01:48:11.707]  A reference to Obama's address last night and to the war in Libya.
[01:48:12.008 --> 01:48:13.289]  Yes.
[01:48:13.369 --> 01:48:15.090]  Not a war, conspiracy theorist!
[01:48:15.511 --> 01:48:17.292]  Remember Carl Rove?
[01:48:17.332 --> 01:48:18.634]  Pull me up the Carl Rove clip.
[01:48:18.694 --> 01:48:20.235]  I'm on fire here, but I'm going to go to you, John.
[01:48:20.695 --> 01:48:21.876]  Pull up Carl Rove.
[01:48:22.657 --> 01:48:23.077]  Yes, sir.
[01:48:23.157 --> 01:48:24.037]  Kinetic military action.
[01:48:46.507 --> 01:48:48.409]  Yeah, our dear leader referenced Bosnia.
[01:48:49.510 --> 01:48:58.677]  The 78 days we bombed Serbia with depleted uranium for humanitarian reasons.
[01:48:59.978 --> 01:49:07.204]  Since you brought up Al-Qaeda backing the KLA, not just today, but back in martial law, I was hoping you could go into a little detail
[01:49:08.809 --> 01:49:13.754]  Refresh the public's memory on how the Mutah Hadim was used to stir the pot there?
[01:49:13.774 --> 01:49:14.114]  Sure.
[01:49:14.194 --> 01:49:26.306]  In my 2005 film, Martial Law, 9-1-1 Rides the Police State, a three-hour treatise, I think it's one of my best films, and it's available on DVD at InfoWars.com if folks want to get it, or it's free all over the web, but you might want to
[01:49:26.786 --> 01:49:29.067]  You know, put some change in the kitty here, folks.
[01:49:29.307 --> 01:49:33.049]  Plus have it on high quality for your archives and to share and make copies from.
[01:49:33.069 --> 01:49:37.911]  No, we just show all the mainstream news admitting, yeah, Al Qaeda's wonderful and they're attacking the Serbs.
[01:49:37.931 --> 01:49:39.432]  And when the Serbs fought back, it's evil.
[01:49:39.772 --> 01:49:45.475]  So they had to bomb the entire country and their water treatment and power plants and TV stations with giant DU bombs.
[01:49:46.335 --> 01:49:47.576]  And why not?
[01:49:47.616 --> 01:49:48.436]  It's good for our troops.
[01:49:48.476 --> 01:49:49.616]  It must be good for the Serbs.
[01:49:49.636 --> 01:49:52.237]  It's like dropping flowers on them.
[01:49:52.257 --> 01:50:04.862]  And it turned out, the UN report even admitted, not saying the Serbs were good, it was ethnic cleansing, that the Croats and Muslims killed around double in the ten years of war before that what the Serbs did.
[01:50:05.382 --> 01:50:06.062]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:50:06.162 --> 01:50:08.323]  They said the Serbs were the bad guys.
[01:50:08.763 --> 01:50:19.547]  They had one-third of their land taken, basically given as a satellite to the drug-running Albania, Al-Qaeda run, and they admitted Al-Qaeda was there, and it was a CIA run, and if you don't like Al-Qaeda, you're bad.
[01:50:19.967 --> 01:50:20.868]  I mean, what else do you say?
[01:50:20.928 --> 01:50:22.709]  Al-Qaeda is the good guys.
[01:50:22.769 --> 01:50:25.049]  I don't agree with that, so I'm an un-American piece of trash.
[01:50:27.110 --> 01:50:34.593]  I thought I'd point out, too, last night, there was a line of truth that came out from King Obama, and that was, he said, some nations
[01:50:35.146 --> 01:50:37.007]  Now, dropping DU all over the Libyans is good.
[01:50:37.027 --> 01:50:37.627]  Man, you are sick.
[01:50:37.647 --> 01:50:38.227]  This is not a war.
[01:50:38.247 --> 01:50:39.167]  DU is good.
[01:50:39.207 --> 01:50:39.868]  Fukushima is good.
[01:50:39.888 --> 01:50:40.028]  Shut up.
[01:51:00.523 --> 01:51:01.784]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:01.824 --> 01:51:07.166]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.407 --> 01:51:12.029]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:12.429 --> 01:51:12.829]  It's true.
[01:51:12.909 --> 01:51:17.472]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:17.992 --> 01:51:22.693]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:23.214 --> 01:51:30.136]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:30.336 --> 01:51:31.236]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:31.456 --> 01:51:37.818]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:38.138 --> 01:51:40.961]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:41.321 --> 01:51:43.203]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[01:51:44.684 --> 01:51:47.626]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:48.127 --> 01:51:49.868]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

[01:52:59.651 --> 01:53:06.037]  Dr. David Barry has provided excellent advice for all those interested in practical economics and sound money.
[01:53:06.478 --> 01:53:07.799]  It's certainly worth reading.
[01:53:08.099 --> 01:53:15.927]  That's what Congressman Ron Paul said about Chachine Wisdom, 123 Practical Universal Truths About Money, the new book by Dr. David Barry.
[01:53:16.167 --> 01:53:24.029]  The cool part of this book, certainly it'll speak to you personally, your life, your lifestyle, your money, your investments, but it also can be generalized into the nation.
[01:53:24.069 --> 01:53:25.090]  What's going on as a nation?
[01:53:25.150 --> 01:53:27.551]  We do these same things personally that we do as a nation.
[01:53:27.931 --> 01:53:37.594]  Dr. Berry's book, Tehching Wisdom, presents many facets of your relationship with the once almighty dollar and how current national and international politics affect your daily life.
[01:53:37.754 --> 01:53:39.374]  Some of the other things are about that.
[01:53:39.474 --> 01:53:42.015]  They're not just economic, they're philosophical.
[01:53:42.115 --> 01:53:43.756]  There's psychology involved in this book.
[01:53:43.796 --> 01:53:45.136]  There's philosophy involved in this book.
[01:53:45.436 --> 01:53:48.080]  Read Cha-Ching Wisdom by Dr. David Barry, only $9.95.
[01:53:48.121 --> 01:53:51.286]  Available at ChachingWisdom.com.
[01:53:51.526 --> 01:53:55.452]  That's C-H-A-C-H-I-N-G-Wisdom.com.
[01:53:55.873 --> 01:53:57.516]  ChachingWisdom.com.
[01:54:03.987 --> 01:54:08.671]  By the way, Aaron Dykes ran in here during the break and said, look, you've got to look at more quotes in Rockefeller's book.
[01:54:08.732 --> 01:54:12.916]  I read it years ago, where he talks about the Bilderberg Group and world government.
[01:54:12.936 --> 01:54:15.658]  So Aaron's going to be popping in at 8 after for a few minutes to go over that.
[01:54:16.139 --> 01:54:21.824]  Also, we're trying to dig up the full Karl Rove quote, because he said it to a group of Washington Post, New York Times.
[01:54:22.245 --> 01:54:24.867]  They reported it was like six or seven reporters at a cocktail party.
[01:54:25.828 --> 01:54:27.989]  And they said, you know, these wars are killing people.
[01:54:28.029 --> 01:54:30.271]  You know, you did lie about WMDs.
[01:54:30.791 --> 01:54:33.913]  And he says, look, you guys can try to go with reality if you want.
[01:54:33.973 --> 01:54:34.873]  We're an empire now.
[01:54:35.033 --> 01:54:36.194]  We control reality.
[01:54:36.634 --> 01:54:38.435]  And we'll change what we say day to day.
[01:54:38.455 --> 01:54:40.357]  And whatever we say is the new reality.
[01:54:40.997 --> 01:54:43.138]  You know, Al Qaeda's good one day, it's bad the next.
[01:54:43.598 --> 01:54:44.259]  It's good again.
[01:54:44.979 --> 01:54:45.099]  It's 1984.
[01:54:46.786 --> 01:54:47.907]  We're history's actors now.
[01:54:47.987 --> 01:54:48.947]  We control reality.
[01:54:49.327 --> 01:54:51.408]  All you can do is sit there and watch it.
[01:54:51.709 --> 01:54:54.630]  I'm paraphrasing him, but we're going to find the full quote and go over it.
[01:54:55.090 --> 01:54:56.091]  This is the arrogance.
[01:54:56.111 --> 01:55:00.953]  That's why they practice this on you to kind of befuddle you and go, uranium is good for you.
[01:55:02.114 --> 01:55:04.875]  TSA sticking your hands down your pants, that's security.
[01:55:05.676 --> 01:55:13.360]  The government doing unannounced drills at elementary schools, coming in and screaming they're going to kill your children and terrorizing them, that's security.
[01:55:14.718 --> 01:55:17.282]  You know, we're gonna listen to all your phones without wiretaps now.
[01:55:17.422 --> 01:55:17.943]  That's freedom!
[01:55:18.837 --> 01:55:21.258]  Now, we're not listening to you without wiretaps, but we are.
[01:55:21.618 --> 01:55:32.282]  And public schools from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Sacramento, California, we're going to watch you on government-issued laptops, which are free.
[01:55:32.462 --> 01:55:33.023]  They're not free.
[01:55:33.043 --> 01:55:35.023]  You pay for them with tax money, but they're free.
[01:55:35.624 --> 01:55:36.544]  We're going to watch you.
[01:55:36.564 --> 01:55:37.364]  See, everything's a lie.
[01:55:37.744 --> 01:55:38.705]  We're going to watch you at home.
[01:55:38.725 --> 01:55:40.625]  What are you going to do about that, huh?
[01:55:41.066 --> 01:55:41.766]  You don't like that?
[01:55:42.426 --> 01:55:43.487]  You don't like it, huh?
[01:55:43.747 --> 01:55:44.747]  You don't like it in your face?
[01:55:45.047 --> 01:55:45.647]  We're going to do it.
[01:55:45.687 --> 01:55:46.448]  We're going to do more.
[01:55:47.426 --> 01:55:51.696]  And we're going to finance rebels, Al Qaeda to attack countries, and we're going to go in and help Al Qaeda.
[01:55:51.976 --> 01:55:52.678]  And you're going to like it.
[01:55:53.941 --> 01:55:55.745]  And it's not going to be called war, either.
[01:55:56.667 --> 01:55:58.488]  And the yuppies go, yeah, that's right, not war.
[01:55:58.508 --> 01:56:00.009]  Because, see, they're trendy.
[01:56:00.029 --> 01:56:02.691]  They know how to, well, I know how to buy into the propaganda.
[01:56:02.711 --> 01:56:04.452]  I have Crimestop, as George Orwell said.
[01:56:05.092 --> 01:56:08.214]  You know, whenever I see something that's a lie, I just decide to go along with it.
[01:56:08.454 --> 01:56:10.996]  And that makes me morally superior and stylish.
[01:56:11.396 --> 01:56:20.381]  Why, I'm so intellectual, I watch the Sunday news shows, and then I parrot what they said around the coffee or water cooler, and people think I'm smart around the office.
[01:56:21.342 --> 01:56:22.503]  And there's some guy in the office
[01:56:23.669 --> 01:56:27.871]  You know, who says they're setting up a world government and devaluing the currency.
[01:56:28.071 --> 01:56:29.311]  He even brings in news articles.
[01:56:29.351 --> 01:56:29.892]  He's a kook.
[01:56:31.892 --> 01:56:32.473]  I'm smart.
[01:56:33.313 --> 01:56:34.233]  I'm official.
[01:56:34.454 --> 01:56:35.374]  I'm cool.
[01:56:36.274 --> 01:56:37.195]  I parrot things.
[01:56:38.115 --> 01:56:38.395]  Why?
[01:56:38.815 --> 01:56:47.479]  I'm a software engineer, and they've brought in foreigners, and I'm training them to replace me, but it's good, and I'm not even going to say anything about it.
[01:56:50.834 --> 01:56:52.435]  Because I'm a member of the establishment.
[01:56:52.715 --> 01:56:54.937]  I feel like David Rockefeller's patting me on the head.
[01:56:54.957 --> 01:57:07.807]  And they've got global CFR, regional CFR, local CFR spinoffs, and people making a few hundred thousand a year going in their suits, and you'll see them, you know, just basking at events, sitting around, just, oh, it's so good to be back.
[01:57:08.287 --> 01:57:37.327]  I've really arrived and they'll go to fundraisers and give $1,000 a sit at the table and feel big and George W. Bush or Obama will shake their hand and they'll click their heels and they send the Council on Foreign Relations people out to universities to speak and they send the Federal Reserve out to tell folks how great they are and the professors bring them in and feel honored to have them and oh they sit there and tell them about how good world government is and how people who don't like it are kooks.
[01:57:39.548 --> 01:57:57.653]  And they take the best and brightest out of the public and private high schools and private schools and have UN, model UN, and the kids go and learn about global government and how bad America and the family and guns are and their parents are so proud of their salutatorians and valedictorians that are part of the UN.
[01:57:57.753 --> 01:58:06.476]  My son was invited to the United Nations and sat in the gallery while the Secretary General addressed on world peace.
[01:58:07.316 --> 01:58:08.617]  How dare you not like this!
[01:58:08.797 --> 01:58:10.898]  And you see the Miss Americas to win.
[01:58:11.118 --> 01:58:12.799]  They've all got a call for U.N.
[01:58:12.819 --> 01:58:14.859]  and gun control.
[01:58:14.919 --> 01:58:15.860]  And, oh, they win.
[01:58:16.180 --> 01:58:19.101]  Oh, you're anti-America.
[01:58:19.161 --> 01:58:19.622]  You win.
[01:58:20.042 --> 01:58:21.282]  Oh, the lady's gonna win.
[01:58:21.322 --> 01:58:23.443]  She says she wants to control the borders and states' rights.
[01:58:23.904 --> 01:58:24.724]  You were gonna win.
[01:58:24.964 --> 01:58:27.625]  You were in first place, but sorry, you get second place now.
[01:58:27.905 --> 01:58:29.946]  You didn't say you were for open borders.
[01:58:30.246 --> 01:58:30.907]  Bye-bye.
[01:58:31.767 --> 01:58:32.528]  We're the bankers.
[01:58:32.588 --> 01:58:33.508]  We've got all the money.
[01:58:33.808 --> 01:58:36.750]  And we decide who can operate and who can't.
[01:58:36.790 --> 01:58:37.671]  We've got all the money.
[01:58:37.711 --> 01:58:38.672]  You do what we say.
[01:58:38.692 --> 01:58:39.532]  Now lick our hand.
[01:58:41.894 --> 01:58:43.235]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:55.537 --> 01:58:58.398]  The Japanese tragedy proves how important food is.
[01:58:58.738 --> 01:59:01.819]  Our own gas prices are driving food costs through the roof.
[01:59:02.059 --> 01:59:06.741]  The huge population countries are buying up American unprotected exports of food.
[01:59:07.081 --> 01:59:09.242]  The falling dollar is inflating food prices.
[01:59:09.722 --> 01:59:14.203]  Ethanol subsidies are driving fuel and food costs to all-time highs.
[01:59:14.543 --> 01:59:20.525]  We are experiencing the greatest explosion of food shortages and food prices America has ever seen.
[01:59:20.825 --> 01:59:25.128]  Folks, you have to freeze the cost and availability of your food now.

[01:59:53.197 --> 01:59:55.118]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:55.578 --> 01:59:58.460]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.003 --> 02:00:05.643]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.303 --> 02:00:07.364]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.084 --> 02:00:09.225]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:09.825 --> 02:00:10.666]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.426 --> 02:00:12.386]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.967 --> 02:00:16.628]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.149 --> 02:00:21.231]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:37.791 --> 02:00:44.514]  Alright, I'm going to continue with open phones throughout the hour, but I pretty much segued into covering the globalists, the chieftains of the New World Order.
[02:00:44.534 --> 02:00:47.014]  I want to go into some more David Rockefeller quotes in the next segment.
[02:00:47.615 --> 02:00:57.658]  And we did find the full New York Times Magazine, Karl Rove quote, where the Washington Post, New York Times, and other top reporters are around him at a party.
[02:00:58.239 --> 02:00:59.939]  And they said, we're in the reality-based community.
[02:00:59.959 --> 02:01:01.200]  You know, you guys lie a lot.
[02:01:02.100 --> 02:01:02.840]  He said, doesn't matter.
[02:01:02.880 --> 02:01:03.821]  We control reality.
[02:01:03.841 --> 02:01:04.601]  Don't you understand that?
[02:01:04.621 --> 02:01:06.482]  And I'm going to read that quote coming up.
[02:01:07.327 --> 02:01:12.050]  And see, the elect minions know how to buy into being conned.
[02:01:12.911 --> 02:01:14.052]  That's stylish.
[02:01:14.212 --> 02:01:15.013]  That's cool.
[02:01:15.073 --> 02:01:15.893]  Being a chump.
[02:01:16.514 --> 02:01:17.454]  Being a schmuck.
[02:01:17.554 --> 02:01:18.355]  Being a fool.
[02:01:18.415 --> 02:01:19.196]  Being an idiot.
[02:01:19.256 --> 02:01:20.096]  Being a moron.
[02:01:20.396 --> 02:01:21.317]  Being conned.
[02:01:21.697 --> 02:01:22.618]  That's cool.
[02:01:22.878 --> 02:01:23.979]  Being uninformed.
[02:01:24.379 --> 02:01:25.840]  That's grace.
[02:01:26.581 --> 02:01:27.562]  That's style.
[02:01:28.262 --> 02:01:30.964]  You're heroes being a bunch of gang-banging sports figures.
[02:01:31.384 --> 02:01:32.925]  That's true leadership.
[02:01:33.966 --> 02:01:34.907]  Being on Prozac.
[02:01:36.539 --> 02:01:38.860]  Dying young of cancer, that style.
[02:01:41.081 --> 02:01:44.762]  Let's talk to Keith Ian Tejas, you're on the air, welcome.
[02:01:46.163 --> 02:01:48.984]  Mr. Jones, it's Keith with Funkmaster5 channel, how you doing?
[02:01:49.044 --> 02:01:51.365]  Well done with what you're doing on YouTube, how you doing?
[02:01:52.645 --> 02:02:04.530]  Well, uh, I just want to throw out there real quick, um, anybody who follows Glenn Beck and thinks he's a conservative and thinks about his restoring honor rally and all his
[02:02:05.051 --> 02:02:10.057]  His claims to be, you know, down with home values and family values.
[02:02:10.557 --> 02:02:19.387]  All you need to do is Google search, Glenn Beck has gay fantasy, and that should definitely hold out there.
[02:02:20.914 --> 02:02:22.015]  Oh, his crazy rant.
[02:02:22.315 --> 02:02:23.715]  That's really discredited him.
[02:02:24.075 --> 02:02:27.077]  I'm sad he did that, attacking me last week.
[02:02:27.117 --> 02:02:28.497]  But I mean, it's so insane.
[02:02:29.418 --> 02:02:34.940]  And this is the big Christian Mormon leader who leads people in prayer at the at the monument.
[02:02:35.240 --> 02:02:41.603]  And he takes little clips of me saying, man, Charlie, because I was there helping him make sure he stayed clean and off drugs.
[02:02:41.983 --> 02:02:43.143]  I said, man, you're working out.
[02:02:43.163 --> 02:02:43.843]  You look great.
[02:02:43.883 --> 02:02:44.584]  You're clean.
[02:02:45.464 --> 02:02:48.645]  And they took that and turned it into
[02:02:50.706 --> 02:02:54.287]  I guess, well, we all know what Glenn Beck did.
[02:02:54.387 --> 02:02:55.027]  It's very bizarre.
[02:02:55.067 --> 02:02:55.847]  I can't repeat it on air.
[02:02:57.148 --> 02:03:09.751]  Well, you know, he's the equivalent of somebody walking by, seeing somebody who's injured in the street, you know, with a broken leg or bleeding or sick, running by, seeing a bunch of people kicking him, and then running by and sneaking in and getting a kick himself, too.
[02:03:10.231 --> 02:03:13.392]  You know, and it's really sad and pitiful to see that he's doing the same thing.
[02:03:13.412 --> 02:03:16.212]  Well, it means we're getting to him.
[02:03:16.552 --> 02:03:19.233]  And we forced him to go further on covering the New World Order.
[02:03:20.826 --> 02:03:32.872]  And I wish him nothing but well, but from reading about him, making jokes about friends of his that had miscarriages and things, I mean, he's a very twisted, hurt person.
[02:03:33.552 --> 02:03:46.398]  And the globalists put him in power because he is unstable and can later be destroyed, and the reports are he's got a lot of stuff hidden about him, and he's just a very mentally unstable person, and we really feel sorry for Glenn.
[02:03:47.867 --> 02:03:48.788]  It's not a big surprise.
[02:03:48.828 --> 02:03:59.540]  I mean, there's even a video circulating around YouTube where he admits that he converted to be a Mormon in the first place so that he could get who he's now married to, his wife, to have sex with him.
[02:03:59.580 --> 02:04:00.281]  Yeah, he said that.
[02:04:00.321 --> 02:04:02.604]  I've seen it straight up on a national TV interview.
[02:04:03.645 --> 02:04:04.326]  There's your Mormon.
[02:04:04.346 --> 02:04:07.009]  There's your, hey, there's your restoring honor right there.
[02:04:09.431 --> 02:04:12.653]  Well, it's pretty amazing, Keith, but I'm not judging him.
[02:04:14.053 --> 02:04:19.976]  I mean, I judge him on his political statements and what he stands for, and he does put out some good fruit.
[02:04:21.517 --> 02:04:26.820]  It's a mixed tree, but it's because the globalists are so desperate to control this movement.
[02:04:26.860 --> 02:04:33.263]  We've done such a good job of really getting the facts out there that it was discrediting the system, so they kind of put out a twisted
[02:04:33.843 --> 02:04:35.965]  Doppelganger of myself and others.
[02:04:36.005 --> 02:04:40.689]  He's a composite to try to lead the movement into war, torture, and the Patriot Act.
[02:04:41.469 --> 02:04:43.171]  But at least he is covering the Federal Reserve.
[02:04:43.211 --> 02:04:45.953]  That shows how far we've come, how far Ron Paul's come, Keith.
[02:04:45.973 --> 02:04:47.694]  But I really don't want to get into Glenn Beck and all that.
[02:04:47.714 --> 02:04:52.138]  I mean, it's actually a great victory that he's attacking me and Bill O'Reilly is.
[02:04:52.158 --> 02:04:54.520]  You know what Gandhi said?
[02:04:54.560 --> 02:04:57.302]  First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they attack you, then you win.
[02:04:57.722 --> 02:04:58.203]  We're winning.
[02:04:58.223 --> 02:04:58.863]  Duh.
[02:05:00.264 --> 02:05:01.386]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:05:01.426 --> 02:05:08.112]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:05:08.392 --> 02:05:10.675]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:05:10.935 --> 02:05:16.100]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:05:16.300 --> 02:05:19.081]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:05:19.341 --> 02:05:21.442]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:05:21.662 --> 02:05:27.603]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:05:27.924 --> 02:05:31.104]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:05:31.285 --> 02:05:36.806]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:05:37.066 --> 02:05:38.387]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:05:38.707 --> 02:05:39.887]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:05:40.007 --> 02:05:42.528]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:05:42.688 --> 02:05:46.731]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:05:46.911 --> 02:05:51.394]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:05:51.534 --> 02:05:53.976]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[02:06:01.837 --> 02:06:05.478]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:06:05.798 --> 02:06:13.921]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:06:14.661 --> 02:06:18.702]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:06:19.282 --> 02:06:30.106]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:06:30.746 --> 02:06:39.754]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:06:40.255 --> 02:06:45.299]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:06:45.680 --> 02:06:52.866]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:06:53.186 --> 02:06:55.588]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[02:07:01.013 --> 02:07:04.654]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:07:05.034 --> 02:07:08.055]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:07:08.275 --> 02:07:13.056]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:07:13.076 --> 02:07:19.318]  We have tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:07:19.458 --> 02:07:21.699]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:07:22.159 --> 02:07:22.439]  Tim Geithner?
[02:07:22.459 --> 02:07:22.619]  Bernanke?
[02:07:22.639 --> 02:07:23.059]  They're arsonists!
[02:07:23.079 --> 02:07:23.700]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:07:23.780 --> 02:07:25.460]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:07:41.147 --> 02:07:42.989]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:07:43.289 --> 02:07:48.073]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:07:48.433 --> 02:07:58.361]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:08:00.543 --> 02:08:05.446]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:05.807 --> 02:08:08.089]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:15.171 --> 02:08:26.301]  You know, periodically, every few months, I will go pull from the thousands and thousands of Council on Foreign Relations quotes on their own website.
[02:08:27.122 --> 02:08:30.225]  Because they've got stuff up there going back to 1922 when they were set up.
[02:08:30.325 --> 02:08:31.626]  They've loaded it up there.
[02:08:32.106 --> 02:08:39.933]  And their recent comments about how they would set up ten regions in America, ten regions in every other country, shaborn national sovereignty, sign it over.
[02:08:40.754 --> 02:08:43.156]  to a private international banking cartel.
[02:08:43.676 --> 02:09:01.030]  Then in the 70s they said that they would bring out carbon taxes in the future, tax everyone on human activity, pay to them to control all activity so you can't even have a business, a job, a barn, build a shack, you know, outback your house, fix your home without going through international zoning.
[02:09:01.730 --> 02:09:09.714]  Just like with the insurance companies writing the health care bill to only allow their companies to then be exempt, thus shutting down all competition.
[02:09:10.014 --> 02:09:21.600]  Or the globalists in the 70s moving their base of construction operations and manufacturing to China, having China lower their currency as a tariff so we couldn't compete, de-industrializing America, the giant sucking sound.
[02:09:22.040 --> 02:09:24.001]  What did Al Gore do in the debates in 1992-1993 when the
[02:09:29.984 --> 02:09:35.471]  Independent candidate Ross Perot would say, you're going to hear a giant sucking sound, we're going to be de-industrialized, wages are going to drop.
[02:09:36.112 --> 02:09:37.334]  Al Gore would just laugh at him.
[02:09:39.148 --> 02:09:41.669]  President Bush would laugh at him in the debates.
[02:09:41.749 --> 02:09:46.550]  Clinton would laugh at him in the debates that they had over and over again on Larry King Live.
[02:09:46.570 --> 02:09:49.090]  He would just laugh and go, it's a good deal, Larry.
[02:09:49.871 --> 02:09:50.391]  It's great.
[02:09:50.431 --> 02:09:52.771]  We have all that in the film Fall of the Republic.
[02:09:53.331 --> 02:09:58.553]  Well, now you see, 16, 17 years later, 18 years later, how good was it?
[02:09:58.793 --> 02:09:59.473]  Was it wonderful?
[02:10:00.450 --> 02:10:04.473]  So, last hour I was reading quotes about Rockefeller saying, yeah, I want global government.
[02:10:04.813 --> 02:10:06.094]  I want to get rid of national sovereignty.
[02:10:06.134 --> 02:10:06.994]  I'm guilty as charged.
[02:10:07.355 --> 02:10:08.815]  Then he gets into Bilderberg Group next.
[02:10:08.855 --> 02:10:16.240]  But before I go to that, here's another globalist quote out of the New York Times Magazine.
[02:10:17.361 --> 02:10:26.507]  It is a lengthy 15-page article, and here is the cover of it, if you are a PrisonPlanet.tv viewer.
[02:10:26.947 --> 02:10:28.448]  If not, just search the term.
[02:10:30.268 --> 02:10:33.690]  Certainty and the presidency of George W. Bush.
[02:10:35.011 --> 02:10:45.937]  And then you turn to page 10 in New York Magazine and it's the New York Times, the Washington Post and a coterie of super high-powered reporters.
[02:10:47.058 --> 02:10:53.322]  And they're talking to him and they're saying, this is written a few years after the invasion of Iraq,
[02:10:54.309 --> 02:10:59.854]  It's actually about a year after, October 17, 2004, a little more than a year, 16 months or so.
[02:11:01.556 --> 02:11:04.919]  And they're sitting there talking to Karl Rove and they're going, but yeah, you guys lie.
[02:11:04.959 --> 02:11:06.821]  This isn't a private discussion.
[02:11:07.442 --> 02:11:08.443]  You're constantly lying.
[02:11:12.345 --> 02:11:24.757]  And it goes on, in the summer of 2002, after I'd written an article in Esquires, from the New York Times, that the White House didn't like about Bush's former communications director, Karen Hughes, I had a meeting with a senior advisor to Bush.
[02:11:25.157 --> 02:11:30.943]  He expressed the White House's displeasure, and then told me something that at the time I didn't fully comprehend.
[02:11:32.025 --> 02:11:35.207]  That which I now believe gets to the very heart of the presidency.
[02:11:35.527 --> 02:11:41.630]  Now see, the New York Times claims this was a recorded meeting, but then a bunch of other reporters said, well, the same thing was said at the cocktail party.
[02:11:41.950 --> 02:11:48.914]  So I guess they were either recording that, so there was also a debate about this, but Karl Rove then went on to confirm that he indeed had said this and said this many times.
[02:11:51.415 --> 02:11:55.157]  So he goes on to say, but which I now believe gets to the very heart of the Bush presidency.
[02:11:55.438 --> 02:11:59.280]  Yeah, like Bush saying, it isn't illegal when the president says do it.
[02:11:59.600 --> 02:12:00.460]  That's what Nixon said.
[02:12:00.500 --> 02:12:01.101]  Oh, I can order
[02:12:02.199 --> 02:12:09.227]  Lying and stealing and breaking into people's houses and wiretapping without warrants, because when the President does it, it isn't illegal.
[02:12:10.108 --> 02:12:17.357]  Now listen to what Karl Rove told New York Times writer Ron Susskind, okay?
[02:12:19.127 --> 02:12:30.437]  The aide said these guys like me, and he's not saying Karl Rove at the time, it later came out it was Karl Rove, the aide said that guys like me were quote, in what we call the reality-based community.
[02:12:30.818 --> 02:12:33.420]  So Karl Rove says you're in the reality-based community.
[02:12:33.440 --> 02:12:42.809]  Remember Matt Drudge a few months ago took my quote live on air, where I said there's no rest for those of us that live in reality, those of us that work in reality.
[02:12:42.829 --> 02:12:44.951]  Will you guys go to his Twitter and get me my actual quote?
[02:12:47.691 --> 02:12:48.531]  That it was better than that.
[02:12:48.551 --> 02:12:52.833]  The point is, I said, there's no rest for those of us that live and work in reality.
[02:12:55.334 --> 02:13:06.439]  But again, Karl Rove says to the New York Times reporter, in what we call the reality-based community, he says, the aide said that guys like me were in what we call the reality-based community.
[02:13:06.899 --> 02:13:09.680]  So Karl Rove's saying, well, you're living in reality, pal.
[02:13:10.891 --> 02:13:13.972]  See, they are psychological warfare experts.
[02:13:14.052 --> 02:13:15.253]  They know when they say D.U.'
[02:13:15.233 --> 02:13:22.135]  's good for you and Fukushima's good for you and they have the left and right say it, that it confuses people and bewilders you.
[02:13:22.255 --> 02:13:27.097]  And instead of you having the moral high ground and everybody admitting a fact, they just go, we pretend it doesn't exist.
[02:13:27.117 --> 02:13:31.659]  It's like Bill Clinton saying, it depends on what the word is, is.
[02:13:31.679 --> 02:13:33.179]  On the definition of is.
[02:13:33.199 --> 02:13:34.080]  People are like, what?
[02:13:34.100 --> 02:13:35.540]  And he goes, oh, you're not smart enough to get it.
[02:13:35.880 --> 02:13:37.021]  No, I get it, you're a con artist.
[02:13:38.871 --> 02:13:46.851]  In what we call the reality-based community, which he defined as people who quote, believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study.
[02:13:48.163 --> 02:13:49.404]  of discernible reality.
[02:13:49.764 --> 02:13:52.206]  So he says, you people are what we call the reality-based community.
[02:13:52.767 --> 02:13:59.111]  Quote, you believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality.
[02:13:59.131 --> 02:13:59.912]  See, that's what I do.
[02:14:00.432 --> 02:14:03.675]  History, reality, globalist documents, they're public plans.
[02:14:04.295 --> 02:14:11.441]  See, I believe, I do believe, I am in the reality-based community, that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality.
[02:14:12.121 --> 02:14:17.285]  I nodded, the New York Times reporter said, and murmured something about enlightenment principles
[02:14:18.437 --> 02:14:20.198]  and things being empirical.
[02:14:20.398 --> 02:14:21.239]  He cut me off.
[02:14:22.199 --> 02:14:22.679]  Cut me off.
[02:14:23.160 --> 02:14:27.502]  That's not the way the world really works anymore, said Karl Rove.
[02:14:27.522 --> 02:14:28.062]  He continued.
[02:14:28.502 --> 02:14:31.104]  We're an empire now, and when we act,
[02:14:32.008 --> 02:14:33.849]  We create our own reality.
[02:14:34.069 --> 02:14:38.132]  See, this is what happens to people that have total power and can get away with anything they want.
[02:14:38.493 --> 02:14:41.355]  DynCorp and Halliburton can publicly run giant child kidnapping rings.
[02:14:41.635 --> 02:14:44.137]  It can come out in Houston Chronicle, Chicago Tribune.
[02:14:44.177 --> 02:14:44.957]  Nobody gets in trouble.
[02:14:45.478 --> 02:14:47.639]  I go tell Austin cops I'm walking out of P.F.
[02:14:47.659 --> 02:14:48.540]  Chang's a few years ago.
[02:14:48.840 --> 02:14:49.901]  DynCorp's across the street.
[02:14:50.461 --> 02:14:51.242]  They're laughing at me.
[02:14:51.262 --> 02:14:52.263]  Oh, look, it's Alex Jones.
[02:14:52.343 --> 02:14:53.444]  One of them's a commander.
[02:14:53.464 --> 02:15:05.056]  And I walk over to the big cop and the other little cops, big giant cop, and I said, you know, officer, that DynCorp facility, that's one of their head offices, they're in mainstream news running kidnapping rings.
[02:15:05.457 --> 02:15:09.321]  And he smiled at me and he said, I know, Alex, I work for them.
[02:15:09.341 --> 02:15:12.664]  And they all started just laughing, whether he worked for them or not.
[02:15:13.385 --> 02:15:15.487]  The point is, it was all funny.
[02:15:15.907 --> 02:15:17.889]  See, you're not in the reality-based community.
[02:15:18.269 --> 02:15:24.415]  You know this spirit of gibbering, demonic, servile, giving yourself over to delusions.
[02:15:24.955 --> 02:15:25.936]  Just like Nero did.
[02:15:27.878 --> 02:15:31.921]  Nero burned Rome, part of it, because he wanted to expand his palace, then blamed it on the Christians.
[02:15:32.962 --> 02:15:37.126]  Nero got so crazy, he believed he was a god, and that he couldn't die if he committed suicide, and of course he died.
[02:15:38.291 --> 02:15:41.072]  See, for the most powerful, they go crazy, and then death and destruction.
[02:15:41.472 --> 02:15:50.735]  They reported that Hitler would sit for hours on the Polish front, looking through a telescope, watching bombs and burning, like it was the greatest show on earth, and Stuka bombers.
[02:15:51.375 --> 02:15:51.955]  Dive bombing.
[02:15:54.016 --> 02:15:56.777]  Burning cities, dead children, fire, they love it.
[02:15:57.637 --> 02:15:59.498]  And see, they just giggle.
[02:16:00.218 --> 02:16:01.578]  They giggle and enjoy it.
[02:16:03.299 --> 02:16:06.040]  I nodded and murmured something about enlightenment principles.
[02:16:07.745 --> 02:16:08.465]  He cut me off.
[02:16:08.845 --> 02:16:11.306]  That's not the way the world really works anymore.
[02:16:11.406 --> 02:16:12.206]  Karl Rove continued.
[02:16:12.546 --> 02:16:13.507]  We're an empire now.
[02:16:14.227 --> 02:16:17.108]  And when we act, we create our own reality.
[02:16:17.448 --> 02:16:22.829]  And while you're studying that reality judiciously... Oh, you actually study reality.
[02:16:22.869 --> 02:16:23.350]  I don't care.
[02:16:23.390 --> 02:16:24.290]  You're judicious.
[02:16:24.370 --> 02:16:25.010]  Look at you.
[02:16:25.430 --> 02:16:26.811]  You can think for yourself.
[02:16:26.931 --> 02:16:28.931]  It doesn't matter if you think for yourself.
[02:16:29.191 --> 02:16:30.672]  Resistance is futile.
[02:16:30.972 --> 02:16:31.772]  Which it really isn't.
[02:16:31.792 --> 02:16:33.653]  This is a con artist gibbering game.
[02:16:34.033 --> 02:16:34.873]  He's a little...
[02:16:35.373 --> 02:16:38.614]  Gross, sniveling, unconservative demon.
[02:16:40.435 --> 02:16:49.799]  And while you're studying that reality judiciously, and you will, listen to him, you will, will act again, creating our own other new realities.
[02:16:50.300 --> 02:16:58.183]  Again, and while you're studying that reality judiciously, as you will, will act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too.
[02:16:58.703 --> 02:16:59.844]  See, he's saying it doesn't matter what you do.
[02:17:00.324 --> 02:17:02.145]  And that's how things will sort out.
[02:17:02.845 --> 02:17:10.608]  We're history's actors, and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do.
[02:17:12.709 --> 02:17:15.651]  And he goes on with the other reporters, completely shocked by the statement.
[02:17:16.631 --> 02:17:21.113]  But see, the smart ones, the smart ones, like a Joe Hagan.
[02:17:21.133 --> 02:17:23.894]  We're going to come back and go to Aaron after the break.
[02:17:24.835 --> 02:17:28.516]  The smart ones, like a New York magazine writer.
[02:17:28.556 --> 02:17:32.038]  The smart ones, like a Media Matters Rolling Stone writer.
[02:17:33.311 --> 02:17:39.496]  They know how when they come to my office and I go, here's all the globalist documents, here's their books, do you want these?
[02:17:40.057 --> 02:17:41.278]  No, no thank you.
[02:17:41.918 --> 02:17:45.642]  Do you want me to show you the Rockefeller documents where they put the steroids and the vaccines?
[02:17:46.102 --> 02:17:50.406]  Would you like to see a bunch of quotes on video of them calling for world government and a one-shot policy?
[02:17:51.226 --> 02:17:52.648]  No, no thank you.
[02:17:54.289 --> 02:17:54.489]  Why?
[02:17:54.509 --> 02:17:57.752]  Because you're just reporting on me, the phenomenon.
[02:17:58.212 --> 02:18:00.555]  Well let's not talk about Alex Jones, let's talk about what I stand for.
[02:18:01.235 --> 02:18:05.683]  But instead they just give little crazy sounding bullet points, hoping people don't look deeper.
[02:18:07.065 --> 02:18:10.411]  And I'm saying this is a big deep reservoir of corruption and death and destruction.
[02:18:11.775 --> 02:18:13.937]  And history shows it, and here's the globalist admitting it.
[02:18:14.197 --> 02:18:14.697]  Please look.
[02:18:14.958 --> 02:18:16.299]  Please, for your own family's future.
[02:18:16.319 --> 02:18:17.600]  I'm getting chills right now.
[02:18:18.460 --> 02:18:30.430]  And the yuppies in all of them, flowing from this spiritual blindness, whatever you want to call it, they just giggle and smirk and say, the people of Fukushima should be happy.
[02:18:30.810 --> 02:18:32.211]  This is going to be good for them.
[02:18:33.512 --> 02:18:38.436]  George Monbiot, I might have been on the fence before, now I believe in nuclear power.
[02:18:38.456 --> 02:18:39.517]  People are like, that doesn't make sense.
[02:18:40.620 --> 02:18:41.501]  I control reality.
[02:18:41.981 --> 02:18:43.423]  I've got the backing of the power structure.
[02:18:43.503 --> 02:18:44.303]  I'm George Mombiot.
[02:18:44.764 --> 02:18:46.485]  I go to globalist Bilderberg meetings.
[02:18:46.585 --> 02:18:47.907]  I openly write for world government.
[02:18:48.167 --> 02:18:50.709]  But then I write articles saying, you're crazy if you believe in world government.
[02:18:51.109 --> 02:18:53.932]  Just like David Rockefeller did in his memoirs that we read last hour.
[02:18:54.172 --> 02:18:58.536]  He said, yeah, we're setting up world government, but there's these crazy populists who believe we're setting up a world government, and they're nuts.
[02:18:59.156 --> 02:18:59.617]  But we are.
[02:18:59.637 --> 02:19:02.960]  Now let me talk about the Bilderberg group, he goes on.
[02:19:04.790 --> 02:19:10.798]  I mean, years after this memoir was written, I would still have the New York Times and others say, Jones is insane!
[02:19:10.858 --> 02:19:12.621]  He believes a thing called the Bilderberg Group exists.
[02:19:13.342 --> 02:19:16.947]  And I call the reporter and I go, don't you want their own minutes that have been leaked?
[02:19:16.967 --> 02:19:17.708]  Don't you want to have their own?
[02:19:17.728 --> 02:19:18.769]  And they're like, no, I don't.
[02:19:19.050 --> 02:19:19.891]  Alex, I gotta go.
[02:19:20.672 --> 02:19:21.774]  By the way, you're gonna lose.
[02:19:21.974 --> 02:19:22.355]  Bam!
[02:19:22.415 --> 02:19:23.216]  Slam the phone down.
[02:19:23.717 --> 02:19:32.510]  I get one of the head of the Naval War College people on, who openly calls and says our military works for foreign banks and world government, and I set him up for an interview, but then he figured out who I was.
[02:19:32.550 --> 02:19:34.733]  He thought he was coming on Alex S. Jones' radio show.
[02:19:35.942 --> 02:19:37.483]  I called him up when they couldn't get him on the line.
[02:19:37.523 --> 02:19:38.263]  My producers couldn't.
[02:19:38.523 --> 02:19:40.844]  And he said, I'm not coming on your show during the three-minute break.
[02:19:40.884 --> 02:19:42.645]  He said, no, I will not gratify you.
[02:19:42.665 --> 02:19:43.905]  And I said, but you're calling for world government.
[02:19:43.925 --> 02:19:45.606]  He goes, you're going to lose.
[02:19:46.166 --> 02:19:46.606]  You're going to lose.
[02:19:46.626 --> 02:19:47.787]  And I said, no, you're going to lose.
[02:19:47.807 --> 02:19:48.687]  And he went, never.
[02:19:49.847 --> 02:19:50.248]  Never.
[02:19:50.568 --> 02:19:51.088]  And hung up.
[02:19:51.368 --> 02:19:52.609]  He didn't say I was a liar.
[02:19:53.309 --> 02:19:55.790]  Well, Thomas Barnett, he just said, you're going to lose.
[02:19:56.050 --> 02:19:57.130]  You're going to lose.
[02:19:57.671 --> 02:19:58.931]  We control reality now.
[02:20:00.373 --> 02:20:03.475]  Do you want to learn more about preparing for the hard times ahead?
[02:20:03.615 --> 02:20:08.218]  Have you ever thought about actually getting off the grid and becoming truly self-reliant?

[02:21:00.154 --> 02:21:02.457]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:21:02.537 --> 02:21:04.760]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:21:04.860 --> 02:21:07.624]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:21:08.065 --> 02:21:12.831]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:21:13.171 --> 02:21:17.377]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:21:17.677 --> 02:21:19.980]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.544]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:21:22.884 --> 02:21:25.467]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:21:25.808 --> 02:21:33.418]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:21:33.740 --> 02:21:39.004]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:21:39.124 --> 02:21:41.406]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:21:41.446 --> 02:21:45.409]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:21:45.669 --> 02:21:46.590]  And I got news for you.
[02:21:46.750 --> 02:21:48.051]  You're everyone else.
[02:21:48.071 --> 02:21:49.072]  Invisible Empire.

[02:22:30.081 --> 02:22:34.464]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:22:34.624 --> 02:22:40.348]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.

[02:24:05.003 --> 02:24:20.892]  So what the globalists do is they put a lie out to reporters, to corporate leaders, and they say, look, suspend all moral judgments, suspend critical thinking, cover anything we want, lie, just be our servant, we might give you some chicken feed.
[02:24:21.552 --> 02:24:31.038]  And anyone that comes forward with an argument, a moral argument, or someone who stands up and says, I want to be free, I don't want to go under your tyrannical system, they then just laugh at you and say, you don't
[02:24:31.838 --> 02:24:33.539]  You don't have a stake in reality.
[02:24:33.579 --> 02:24:34.620]  We control reality.
[02:24:34.660 --> 02:24:35.260]  We're God.
[02:24:36.260 --> 02:24:38.342]  And that's what this power trip stems from.
[02:24:38.922 --> 02:24:52.489]  And going back into David Rockefeller's memoirs, published 2002, we already last hour read the quote where he admitted, yes, he wants global government, that yes, the populist, you know, are a bunch of conspiracy theorists, but basically they're right, but he's going to defeat them.
[02:24:52.749 --> 02:24:53.670]  Aaron, go over some of that.
[02:24:54.170 --> 02:25:01.817]  Yeah, that whole book is very tongue-in-cheek because he opens with kind of mocking the little people who are against the world government, the so-called populists, and so forth.
[02:25:02.177 --> 02:25:09.924]  But then he breaks down his little personal accounts of the Council on Foreign Relations, of the Bilderberg Group, and of some of the other groups.
[02:25:11.145 --> 02:25:14.488]  They say that doesn't exist, but oh, he's allowed to talk about it because he's for it.
[02:25:14.908 --> 02:25:15.829]  He controls reality.
[02:25:16.430 --> 02:25:17.911]  Sometimes it exists, sometimes it doesn't.
[02:25:18.211 --> 02:25:18.931]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:25:19.151 --> 02:25:21.232]  No, that's totally... This is their philosophy, folks.
[02:25:21.692 --> 02:25:25.133]  And notice here how he mocks people but still admits Bilderberg exists.
[02:25:25.553 --> 02:25:42.756]  If the Council on Foreign Relations raises the hackles of conspiracy theorists, the Bilderberg meetings must induce apocalyptic visions of omnipotent international bankers plotting with unscrupulous government officials to impose cunning schemes on an ignorant and unsuspecting world.
[02:25:42.776 --> 02:25:43.917]  See how tongue-in-cheek that is?
[02:25:44.457 --> 02:25:45.357]  He's telling you what he's doing.
[02:25:45.777 --> 02:25:48.800]  Yeah, but we've got internal quotes that have been confirmed where he says things like that.
[02:25:50.021 --> 02:25:53.024]  It would have been impossible to do this if the media hadn't worked with us.
[02:25:53.044 --> 02:25:56.807]  We want to thank the Washington Times, the Washington Post, the New York Times.
[02:25:57.108 --> 02:25:58.109]  He didn't say Washington Times.
[02:25:58.149 --> 02:25:58.369]  Go ahead.
[02:25:58.956 --> 02:26:04.460]  He's playing upon our ignorance and I'm sure he's familiar with all the denial about these kind of groups going on.
[02:26:05.260 --> 02:26:10.844]  But deeper into this chapter, you know, there's this perception that Bilderberg are kind of untouchable people.
[02:26:11.284 --> 02:26:16.688]  They're such lofty bankers and militarists and so forth that they can't be touched.
[02:26:17.308 --> 02:26:21.331]  But then he explains how in 1976 the group had to shut down for a year.
[02:26:21.711 --> 02:26:28.656]  How its founder, Prince Bernhard, nearly had to step down from the council and, you know, almost was in criminal trouble.
[02:26:30.117 --> 02:26:39.723]  I don't know if that all would have happened if he would have actually gone to prison, but reading from David Rockefeller in 1976, Bilderberg faced a scandal that almost resulted in its collapse.
[02:26:39.763 --> 02:26:41.324]  That's David Rockefeller admitting it.
[02:26:41.765 --> 02:26:52.672]  Early that year in testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, it was alleged that Prince Bernhard had approached the Lockheed Corporation with an offer to use his official position to influence Dutch defense
[02:26:53.152 --> 02:26:53.652]  Yeah, Obama.
[02:27:15.069 --> 02:27:17.711]  Obama and Hillary in 2008 show up at the secret meeting.
[02:27:17.771 --> 02:27:19.572]  We're there telling the media they're there.
[02:27:19.832 --> 02:27:21.073]  The media is all looking for them.
[02:27:21.133 --> 02:27:22.554]  It says we're not going to go look there.
[02:27:22.914 --> 02:27:25.016]  And they decide that Hillary is going to step down at that meeting.
[02:27:25.436 --> 02:27:25.676]  Yeah.
[02:27:25.796 --> 02:27:32.661]  And we know from all the things Tucker brings out that later become true that there's definitely very important stuff going on at the meeting.
[02:27:33.141 --> 02:27:40.106]  But Rockefeller goes on to explain how in 76 the conference was canceled and it appeared for a time Bilderberg was finished.
[02:27:40.546 --> 02:27:44.989]  Now of course they would have continued under some other name but the point is they aren't
[02:27:45.829 --> 02:27:46.029]  Yes.
[02:28:07.839 --> 02:28:09.640]  Uh, council or board or what have you.
[02:28:09.660 --> 02:28:16.382]  Uh, he was also one of the founders of the World Wildlife Fund, along with the eugenicist Prince Philip and the eugenicist Julian Huxley.
[02:28:16.482 --> 02:28:18.663]  And was caught smuggling elephant tusk out.
[02:28:18.963 --> 02:28:21.504]  They run the wildlife op so they can get the goods themselves.
[02:28:21.844 --> 02:28:24.065]  And it plays into Agenda 21, of course, as well.
[02:28:24.085 --> 02:28:32.408]  Uh, so that's just- And they use, uh, those, those wildlife preserves, this has now been declassified, as military bases to set up rebels to overthrow countries.
[02:28:33.868 --> 02:28:35.129]  Yeah.
[02:28:35.149 --> 02:28:49.282]  It just shows you just a small indicator of how deep Prince Bernhard's influence goes, but yet he was not beyond the reach of the... And his daughter today, the Queen of the Netherlands, is the unofficial head above the puppet head of Bilderberg.
[02:28:49.302 --> 02:28:56.409]  Yeah, and of course he was the founder along with Joseph Redinger, who more or less kind of entrusted him with the idea to form the group.
[02:28:56.529 --> 02:28:59.512]  Yeah, Viscount Etienne d'Avignon is the current head.
[02:29:00.441 --> 02:29:00.641]  Yeah.
[02:29:01.261 --> 02:29:03.522]  And as we know, Bilderberg did more than just talk.
[02:29:03.542 --> 02:29:07.904]  They set up the European Union by stealth and, you know... Hey, brag about that.
[02:29:08.664 --> 02:29:09.545]  But again, that's no big deal.
[02:29:09.565 --> 02:29:10.265]  They don't have any power.
[02:29:10.485 --> 02:29:12.446]  What do you think about the bizarre Karl Rove statement?
[02:29:12.466 --> 02:29:14.527]  That really says it all about how they control reality.
[02:29:15.087 --> 02:29:16.588]  It's evil, but it's deep.
[02:29:17.008 --> 02:29:21.770]  You know, it's a mix of the emperor wears no clothes and kind of the Matrix.
[02:29:21.830 --> 02:29:24.591]  Like, your reality will be what we dictate to you.
[02:29:25.595 --> 02:29:27.956]  Yeah, it's kind of mind-boggling.
[02:29:27.976 --> 02:29:30.236]  And these reporters, they just love it.
[02:29:30.477 --> 02:29:31.957]  They feel like they've joined the power.
[02:29:32.437 --> 02:29:36.999]  And so they just dive in, oh, reality means nothing, I'm part of the power, oh!
[02:29:37.459 --> 02:29:46.662]  And then you watch society being destroyed, because the globalists are such sadomasochistic, murdering scumbags, and we have all the proof of their lust for death and destruction.
[02:29:47.142 --> 02:29:49.142]  You people sold your souls cheaply, didn't you?
[02:29:50.523 --> 02:29:51.463]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.943 --> 02:29:53.444]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.450 --> 02:29:57.146]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.199 --> 02:30:04.442]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:30:04.742 --> 02:30:05.362]  Number one.
[02:30:05.662 --> 02:30:08.824]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:09.085 --> 02:30:09.665]  Number two.
[02:30:09.945 --> 02:30:14.508]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:30:14.848 --> 02:30:15.289]  It's true.
[02:30:15.589 --> 02:30:20.152]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:30:20.452 --> 02:30:21.012]  Number three.
[02:30:21.292 --> 02:30:24.574]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:30:24.875 --> 02:30:28.557]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:28.777 --> 02:30:29.318]  Number 4.
[02:30:29.558 --> 02:30:31.941]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:30:32.321 --> 02:30:35.705]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:30:36.005 --> 02:30:36.225]  Number 5.
[02:30:36.806 --> 02:30:40.730]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:30:40.951 --> 02:30:45.716]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:30:56.807 --> 02:31:01.191]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:31:01.211 --> 02:31:07.917]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:31:08.158 --> 02:31:10.460]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:31:10.700 --> 02:31:15.902]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:31:16.082 --> 02:31:18.864]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:31:19.124 --> 02:31:21.245]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:31:21.445 --> 02:31:27.367]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:31:27.708 --> 02:31:30.889]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:31:31.069 --> 02:31:36.592]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:31:36.852 --> 02:31:38.172]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:31:38.492 --> 02:31:39.633]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:31:39.793 --> 02:31:42.335]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:31:42.475 --> 02:31:46.498]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:31:46.678 --> 02:31:51.181]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:31:51.301 --> 02:31:53.763]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[02:31:53.903 --> 02:31:56.885]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:31:56.905 --> 02:31:57.525]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:32:00.487 --> 02:32:04.769]  Alex has told you about the terrible perfect storm of rising food prices.
[02:32:05.009 --> 02:32:07.871]  The Japanese tragedy proves how important food is.
[02:32:08.211 --> 02:32:11.292]  Our own gas prices are driving food costs through the roof.
[02:32:11.532 --> 02:32:16.215]  The huge population countries are buying up American unprotected exports of food.
[02:32:16.555 --> 02:32:18.696]  The falling dollar is inflating food prices.
[02:32:19.196 --> 02:32:19.436]  I'm good.
[02:32:38.894 --> 02:32:39.935]  We're good to go.
[02:33:07.586 --> 02:33:12.852]  All right, now I'm taking calls and hitting some other key news in the last half hour of this worldwide transmission.
[02:33:12.892 --> 02:33:16.716]  Kyle Richard, Blue Star, Alex, Bruce, we're going to get to all of you and more.
[02:33:17.657 --> 02:33:26.407]  Briefly, we carry the best books, the best videos, not just the films and books that I've written, but other films and books that I believe are extremely informative.
[02:33:27.208 --> 02:33:36.271]  You get tools that will further enlighten and inform you that you can then pass forward to friends and family or have public viewings or private viewings.
[02:33:37.152 --> 02:33:47.956]  It's all about getting the information out and it's all about the info warriors, the people that are awake worldwide, taking action and exposing the globalists and the false reality they've tried to basically set up.
[02:33:48.596 --> 02:33:53.797]  And the yuppies and other servants that have been taught it's trendy to be conned.
[02:33:54.137 --> 02:33:56.578]  It's trendy to not know what's going on.
[02:33:56.958 --> 02:34:07.521]  They're finally getting hurt bad enough by the New World Order that a lot of them are waking up, but then they're being led off by neocons and fake liberals and other globalist foundation-controlled minions.
[02:34:08.001 --> 02:34:11.822]  Now we're almost out of this book, and then it's going to be out of print for a while while he reprints.
[02:34:12.242 --> 02:34:12.782]  We've only got
[02:34:13.582 --> 02:34:17.988]  A very few copies left of Strategic Relocation, North American Guide to Safe Places.
[02:34:18.028 --> 02:34:19.069]  We sold out last week.
[02:34:19.410 --> 02:34:21.272]  Just got a few hundred more in and then that's it.
[02:34:21.352 --> 02:34:22.013]  Joel is out.
[02:34:22.373 --> 02:34:25.898]  Strategic Relocation, North American Guide to Safe Places, third edition.
[02:34:26.358 --> 02:34:28.441]  Excellent information to think about security.
[02:34:28.862 --> 02:34:29.603]  Very well written.
[02:34:30.163 --> 02:34:37.726]  The new book, only available at InfoWars.com, Big Brother, They're a Wellian Nightmare Come True by Mark Dice.
[02:34:37.766 --> 02:34:42.168]  Getting into how the Big Brother system is here, the surveillance, the spying, the control grid.
[02:34:42.629 --> 02:34:43.489]  Excellent new book.
[02:34:43.849 --> 02:34:48.911]  We've also got a Big Brother t-shirt we designed that you can get discounted when you get it with the book or alone.
[02:34:49.312 --> 02:34:50.792]  Available at InfoWars.com.
[02:34:50.832 --> 02:34:52.853]  A great discussion piece.
[02:34:52.873 --> 02:34:53.793]  What's that shirt mean?
[02:34:53.854 --> 02:34:54.474]  Well, it's this.
[02:34:55.014 --> 02:34:55.294]  Yes, sir.
[02:35:10.051 --> 02:35:10.711]  Started today.
[02:35:11.011 --> 02:35:14.333]  New York Times bestselling author Jesse Ventura with Dick Russell.
[02:35:14.513 --> 02:35:16.214]  63 documents the government doesn't want you to read.
[02:35:16.654 --> 02:35:21.576]  Very easy read, full of documents, full of photos, full of information.
[02:35:21.596 --> 02:35:23.537]  This is my favorite type of book.
[02:35:23.577 --> 02:35:24.737]  A great coffee table book.
[02:35:25.097 --> 02:35:31.980]  A great gift to give people, just to give them a primer on how they're being lied to, but it's also very sophisticated, but at the same time a very easy read.
[02:35:33.140 --> 02:35:35.701]  There's the stand down, where Cheney ordered the stand down on 9-11.
[02:35:37.162 --> 02:35:40.064]  Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, under Cheney's directive.
[02:35:40.084 --> 02:35:41.705]  I mean, just look at these documents.
[02:35:42.326 --> 02:35:48.450]  This book, I think, each one gets better as he gets more informed and does more research and works with a great researcher, Dick Russell.
[02:35:48.910 --> 02:35:51.512]  Jesse Ventura, 63 documents the government doesn't want you to read.
[02:35:51.532 --> 02:35:54.213]  When you buy it from us, you support everything we're doing.
[02:35:55.274 --> 02:35:57.015]  Also, what in the world are they spraying?
[02:35:57.135 --> 02:35:59.217]  Excellent film dealing with chemtrails.
[02:35:59.597 --> 02:36:08.543]  And I just had another mainstream news article they gave me, where the government is admitting that comtrails warm the world more than aviation emissions.
[02:36:09.083 --> 02:36:18.830]  And it turns out most of these so-called contrails are having barium salts and aluminum dioxide added into the jet fuel, and so it's being dispersed out and causing nuclei.
[02:36:20.451 --> 02:36:24.594]  But Holder's public program, John P. Holdren,
[02:36:25.782 --> 02:36:34.808]  He says they're doing test chemtrailing to cool the earth, but all the meteorologists we've had on it and astrophysicists and others have pointed out this will heat the earth, not cool it.
[02:36:35.408 --> 02:36:37.170]  And there it is out of the new scientist.
[02:36:37.190 --> 02:36:39.771]  But that's what in the world are they spraying again?
[02:36:40.052 --> 02:36:41.432]  It's how they control reality.
[02:36:41.452 --> 02:36:48.097]  They put uranium and radium and other things in our water, mined out of limestone, mixed in with sodium fluoride.
[02:36:48.117 --> 02:36:49.418]  They call it sodium fluoride.
[02:36:50.258 --> 02:36:51.179]  It comes out in the news.
[02:36:51.199 --> 02:36:52.420]  They're doing it all over the country.
[02:36:52.460 --> 02:36:54.621]  But there's no debate, no discussion, no question.
[02:36:54.701 --> 02:36:55.542]  Why are they doing it?
[02:36:57.233 --> 02:36:58.834]  No discussion of taking it out of the water.
[02:36:58.894 --> 02:36:59.994]  Just, okay, we're doing this to you.
[02:37:00.234 --> 02:37:00.975]  Yeah, we covered it up.
[02:37:01.875 --> 02:37:03.756]  Yeah, people went public inside the water districts.
[02:37:04.076 --> 02:37:04.436]  So what?
[02:37:04.476 --> 02:37:05.156]  We're going to keep doing it.
[02:37:05.616 --> 02:37:16.961]  See, I mean, it's just... It'd be like body snatcher green aliens running around in the street, sucking people's brains out, and the news saying, they're friendly visitors, they're nice, they want to help you.
[02:37:17.241 --> 02:37:19.501]  If you see a green alien running down the street, pull over.
[02:37:20.042 --> 02:37:21.082]  They have a large straw.
[02:37:21.402 --> 02:37:23.203]  Help them stick it in your brain and suck your brain.
[02:37:23.988 --> 02:37:25.210]  Now of course I'm being sarcastic.
[02:37:25.490 --> 02:37:29.737]  Glenn Beck will probably take that out of context and say that I believe in green aliens sucking your brain.
[02:37:30.137 --> 02:37:34.524]  It's as crazy as green aliens sucking your brain and the media is saying it's normal and good.
[02:37:36.035 --> 02:37:38.276]  To go, yeah, we're doing some chemtrailing, but don't worry about it.
[02:37:38.296 --> 02:37:39.837]  Yeah, we're putting uranium in your water.
[02:37:40.218 --> 02:37:40.898]  No big deal.
[02:37:41.859 --> 02:37:44.500]  Yeah, we're taking the veterans' death benefits.
[02:37:44.780 --> 02:37:45.881]  It's in the news, but so what?
[02:37:45.921 --> 02:37:46.781]  Nobody's going to get in trouble.
[02:37:47.062 --> 02:37:49.243]  Yeah, the government's running giant child kidnapping rings.
[02:37:49.643 --> 02:37:50.404]  Comes out in the news.
[02:37:50.704 --> 02:37:51.784]  Comes out in congressional hearings.
[02:37:51.825 --> 02:37:52.645]  Nobody gets in trouble.
[02:37:52.905 --> 02:37:54.166]  Rumsfeld says they're allowed to do it.
[02:37:55.187 --> 02:37:56.267]  Because he controls reality.
[02:37:56.447 --> 02:38:03.952]  Because you let the con artists run wild and have them play this game of, I'm in a suit, and I'm an old, distinguished-looking old man.
[02:38:04.452 --> 02:38:05.673]  Sit down and shut up.
[02:38:07.619 --> 02:38:09.960]  What did people booing Cheney at CPAC do?
[02:38:10.300 --> 02:38:11.900]  He just said, now shut up!
[02:38:12.181 --> 02:38:13.201]  And the minions laughed.
[02:38:13.921 --> 02:38:15.822]  Shut up, I'm the boss.
[02:38:16.322 --> 02:38:17.462]  I do whatever I want.
[02:38:17.722 --> 02:38:19.163]  There's nothing you can do to me.
[02:38:19.563 --> 02:38:20.703]  I'm all powerful.
[02:38:21.064 --> 02:38:23.484]  Let me tell you, how did I sneak into Bohemian Grove?
[02:38:23.885 --> 02:38:29.807]  Well, I snuck around past the checkpoints, into the parking lot, through a swamp, and then once I got in, I just strutted around.
[02:38:29.827 --> 02:38:33.568]  That's what the globalists do.
[02:38:35.772 --> 02:38:47.118]  I mean, the average little people, when they go up to pay with a credit card, they get all nervous it might not go through, or when they go up to get a hotel thing, you know, I've seen people I've traveled with, they get kind of nervous, and the people ask questions and act weird.
[02:38:47.138 --> 02:38:53.922]  I just walk up, I'm polite, and I'm totally confident, and in an instant service, red carpets, oh, you're confident, here, everything's yours.
[02:38:54.122 --> 02:38:56.543]  But see, the globalists, it's the same thing with women.
[02:38:57.324 --> 02:38:59.165]  A lot of guys try to act confident.
[02:39:00.256 --> 02:39:02.338]  Okay, and women pick up on that and they really don't like it.
[02:39:02.938 --> 02:39:08.003]  Some women like kind of the goofy, cute, real guy who isn't confident over a fake guy who acts confident.
[02:39:08.263 --> 02:39:11.345]  But on average, women like really confident men.
[02:39:12.066 --> 02:39:19.412]  I mean, you're confident, and I'm not saying it's a good lifestyle or whatever, but you take the girl out on a couple dates and you're just point-blank, baby.
[02:39:19.432 --> 02:39:21.514]  I think you're just unbelievably gorgeous.
[02:39:22.835 --> 02:39:23.496]  Let's rock and roll.
[02:39:24.465 --> 02:39:24.785]  Boom.
[02:39:24.906 --> 02:39:26.187]  But you're all hesitant about it?
[02:39:26.327 --> 02:39:26.968]  Ain't gonna happen.
[02:39:27.028 --> 02:39:28.750]  And I'm not trying to get into that.
[02:39:28.770 --> 02:39:32.075]  The point is, is that it's an analogy on life.
[02:39:32.315 --> 02:39:35.519]  The globalists just take that to the thousandth degree.
[02:39:36.140 --> 02:39:37.461]  And just, ah, uranium's good.
[02:39:37.481 --> 02:39:38.403]  We're blowing everybody up.
[02:39:38.443 --> 02:39:38.803]  It's peace.
[02:39:38.863 --> 02:39:39.604]  It's not a war.
[02:39:40.165 --> 02:39:41.466]  And the banks are stealing everything.
[02:39:41.486 --> 02:39:42.388]  Ah, what are you gonna do about it?
[02:39:43.953 --> 02:39:47.594]  Alright, I said I'd go to your calls and I said I'd plug these videos, but I went off into a rampage.
[02:39:47.995 --> 02:39:50.296]  The point is, get the books and videos at InfoWars.com.
[02:39:50.356 --> 02:39:51.776]  You vote with your dollars supporting us.
[02:39:52.116 --> 02:39:54.397]  Plus, and most importantly, you get a powerful tool to wake folks up.
[02:39:54.817 --> 02:40:00.680]  All this talk about world government, UN, all this stuff, Endgame, still the preeminent film, available at InfoWars.com.
[02:40:00.960 --> 02:40:04.521]  Police State 4, the rise of FEMA for the total martial law takeover enemy program.
[02:40:04.842 --> 02:40:09.443]  Every police department should see this, because then they'll realize how they're being covertly federalized incrementally.
[02:40:09.784 --> 02:40:10.584]  Everybody needs this.
[02:40:11.104 --> 02:40:12.444]  Everybody in InfraGard needs it.
[02:40:12.884 --> 02:40:13.825]  Your pastors need it.
[02:40:14.025 --> 02:40:16.025]  Chances are they're already on government payroll, secretly.
[02:40:16.305 --> 02:40:16.965]  This will wake them up.
[02:40:17.165 --> 02:40:19.426]  That's why when you try to give it to them, they'll be like, oh, whoa, I don't want terrorist stuff.
[02:40:19.586 --> 02:40:20.546]  Yeah, I know about Alex Jones.
[02:40:20.586 --> 02:40:21.166]  Whoa, whoa.
[02:40:21.186 --> 02:40:22.286]  That's why they send out memos to them.
[02:40:22.806 --> 02:40:23.386]  Don't watch it.
[02:40:24.406 --> 02:40:25.747]  We're reading your email, pastor.
[02:40:25.767 --> 02:40:28.947]  You're part of our secret team now, but don't watch Alex Jones.
[02:40:28.967 --> 02:40:34.188]  A lot of police chiefs try to give them this like, oh, whoa, whoa, that's like a deadly venomous cobra.
[02:40:34.348 --> 02:40:35.588]  No, no, not the video.
[02:40:35.788 --> 02:40:36.989]  Oh, please, not that.
[02:40:37.229 --> 02:40:38.329]  Oh, I've heard about him.
[02:40:39.138 --> 02:40:40.899]  Remember all those internal memos they give the police?
[02:40:40.940 --> 02:40:41.940]  Don't watch Alex Jones.
[02:40:41.960 --> 02:40:42.701]  He's really evil.
[02:40:42.921 --> 02:40:44.122]  He's really manipulative.
[02:40:44.703 --> 02:40:45.924]  He'll actually read our quotes.
[02:40:45.964 --> 02:40:48.966]  He'll actually show us saying, oh, don't, don't, don't watch him.
[02:40:49.146 --> 02:40:52.790]  He'll show you internal FEMA training manuals saying the founding fathers are bad.
[02:40:53.230 --> 02:40:54.071]  Actual video.
[02:40:56.092 --> 02:40:56.713]  I'm nobody.
[02:40:56.753 --> 02:40:57.614]  Folks, I got the truth.
[02:40:57.654 --> 02:40:58.314]  I got history.
[02:40:58.554 --> 02:41:00.036]  I'm not bamboozled by these people.
[02:41:00.156 --> 02:41:00.956]  I can see them.
[02:41:01.737 --> 02:41:02.338]  They live.
[02:41:02.418 --> 02:41:03.559]  I got the sunglasses.
[02:41:04.946 --> 02:41:06.709]  And what has Rowdy Piper got to do to his buddy?
[02:41:06.729 --> 02:41:08.612]  He's got to beat him up to get him to put him on.
[02:41:08.892 --> 02:41:10.275]  He's like, put these on!
[02:41:10.295 --> 02:41:11.937]  The guy's like, I'm not putting them on.
[02:41:12.158 --> 02:41:14.782]  That's an allegory of the general public.
[02:41:15.222 --> 02:41:18.107]  Piper's like, alright, it's going down right now.
[02:41:18.207 --> 02:41:18.948]  You're putting them on.
[02:41:20.131 --> 02:41:20.691]  That's what I do.
[02:41:20.731 --> 02:41:22.813]  I don't come up and apologize to people for this information.
[02:41:23.093 --> 02:41:25.095]  I know it sounds kooky, but there's a world government.
[02:41:25.135 --> 02:41:27.536]  I'm like, listen, there's an emergency situation.
[02:41:27.596 --> 02:41:28.557]  History's repeating itself.
[02:41:28.837 --> 02:41:30.879]  Global private corporations are taking over the planet.
[02:41:31.119 --> 02:41:32.420]  They want a one-child policy.
[02:41:32.840 --> 02:41:38.324]  They've already taken over the planet, so they feel like you're rats or cockroaches eating their grain.
[02:41:38.644 --> 02:41:39.765]  They want you out of the way.
[02:41:39.965 --> 02:41:43.167]  They're setting up a planetary control grid as a means to an end.
[02:41:43.227 --> 02:41:44.088]  Do you understand?
[02:41:44.128 --> 02:41:45.009]  Here's the information.
[02:41:45.269 --> 02:41:46.029]  You've been warned.
[02:41:47.350 --> 02:41:49.212]  And lastly,
[02:41:50.060 --> 02:41:50.840]  Invisible Empire.
[02:41:51.541 --> 02:41:52.561]  Directed by Jason Bermas.
[02:41:52.641 --> 02:41:53.181]  Excellent film.
[02:41:53.201 --> 02:41:54.122]  The New World Order Defined.
[02:41:54.182 --> 02:41:56.122]  Covers the whole spectrum of the history of the New World Order.
[02:41:56.583 --> 02:41:57.383]  Very important film.
[02:41:57.403 --> 02:41:57.643]  Infowars.com.
[02:41:57.663 --> 02:41:57.783]  Or 888-253-3139.
[02:41:57.803 --> 02:41:57.843]  888-253-3139.
[02:41:57.863 --> 02:41:58.503]  Or you can write to us.
[02:41:59.584 --> 02:41:59.624]  P.O.
[02:41:59.644 --> 02:41:59.704]  Box 19549.
[02:41:59.744 --> 02:42:00.024]  Austin Tejas 78760.
[02:42:00.064 --> 02:42:01.104]  Okay, let's go to Kyle in Iowa.
[02:42:01.124 --> 02:42:02.425]  You're on the air, evil person who... Wait, wait.
[02:42:02.445 --> 02:42:03.986]  Let me get the exact Karl Rove quote.
[02:42:04.006 --> 02:42:04.926]  Where did my, uh...
[02:42:19.972 --> 02:42:21.955]  New York Times Magazine Karl Rove thing.
[02:42:22.235 --> 02:42:29.585]  Because I want to announce for the rest of the day these callers as what Karl Rove called, in what we call the reality-based community.
[02:42:29.605 --> 02:42:31.127]  You guys ever find my drudge quote he used?
[02:42:32.309 --> 02:42:32.849]  Off his Twitter?
[02:42:34.211 --> 02:42:37.255]  Well, just Alex Jones' quote, for those of us living in reality.
[02:42:38.680 --> 02:42:39.400]  There is no rest.
[02:42:39.420 --> 02:42:40.841]  There's no rest for those of us living in reality.
[02:42:40.861 --> 02:42:41.902]  I want to get the exact quote.
[02:42:41.962 --> 02:42:43.743]  I don't think that's it.
[02:42:43.763 --> 02:42:45.324]  But see, that's the counter to Karl Rove.
[02:42:45.564 --> 02:42:46.464]  We live in reality.
[02:42:46.524 --> 02:42:49.986]  He says, in what we call the reality-based community.
[02:42:52.728 --> 02:42:56.490]  So let's talk to somebody in the reality-based community, or he may disagree with reality.
[02:42:56.730 --> 02:42:59.332]  Kyle in Iowa, what community are you in?
[02:42:59.652 --> 02:43:04.975]  The deception, believe the lie, gullible giggle reality of the slaves?
[02:43:05.815 --> 02:43:06.876]  Or do you believe in reality?
[02:43:08.194 --> 02:43:08.834]  I choose both.
[02:43:10.355 --> 02:43:13.197]  Alex, I got some hardcore reality for ya.
[02:43:14.177 --> 02:43:29.965]  I don't know if you heard about this, but there was recently a quote-unquote cancelled martial law drill again here in Iowa, and it was due to them claiming that Patriots were death-threatening a school, because they were running some martial law drill to go round up a
[02:43:30.501 --> 02:43:33.042]  A white supremacist who is against illegal immigration.
[02:43:33.502 --> 02:43:43.806]  Yeah, they've had those all over the country where they say, you know, the group in camouflage, cops under federal grants, come in and say, we're groups against public schools for homeschooling.
[02:43:43.826 --> 02:43:44.626]  We're going to kill you.
[02:43:44.646 --> 02:43:48.527]  And the little kids cry and they do a horrible crime against them.
[02:43:48.547 --> 02:43:51.688]  But do it in plain view and say, we control reality.
[02:43:52.509 --> 02:43:58.251]  And then they have other drills where it's a white supremacist against open borders, meaning if you're against open borders, you're a white supremacist.
[02:43:59.151 --> 02:44:04.496]  And then two years ago, it's in the new Police State 4 Rise of FEMA.
[02:44:05.156 --> 02:44:06.017]  We have the Colonel on.
[02:44:06.297 --> 02:44:07.058]  It was in the newspaper.
[02:44:07.318 --> 02:44:10.241]  Yeah, we're going to practice confiscating guns around the town.
[02:44:10.261 --> 02:44:13.524]  We're going to do it and practice arresting the gun shop owners.
[02:44:16.286 --> 02:44:21.952]  Then I got him on and the colonel said, well, yeah, we were going to do that drill, but it's not very nice how you say it's for America.
[02:44:22.252 --> 02:44:24.295]  This was for overseas.
[02:44:24.415 --> 02:44:26.056]  And I said, colonel, I've been to the drills.
[02:44:26.337 --> 02:44:29.580]  The role players and the citizens you hire at these, it's for America.
[02:44:30.341 --> 02:44:34.846]  And then they go, well, it's for America with the role players, but not really for America.
[02:44:35.326 --> 02:44:37.488]  And I'm like, oh, was New Orleans for America?
[02:44:38.109 --> 02:44:42.171]  Taking the guns there, and he goes, uh, well, I don't want to discuss that, eh, boy.
[02:44:42.191 --> 02:44:53.436]  See, because they're all about psych warfare, and he's like, wow, this guy, he tries this Obi-Wan Kenobi thing on me, as these aren't the droids you're looking for, and I go, yeah, these are the droids I'm looking for.
[02:44:54.076 --> 02:44:55.717]  I'm not moving along here, pal.
[02:44:56.417 --> 02:44:57.277]  Get out of the car.
[02:44:57.557 --> 02:44:58.918]  Because I'm a defender of the Republic.
[02:44:58.998 --> 02:44:59.958]  I'm the real cop.
[02:45:00.178 --> 02:45:01.499]  I'm the real sheriff in town.
[02:45:01.679 --> 02:45:03.920]  And so is every other sovereign American.
[02:45:04.500 --> 02:45:05.781]  So, I know what you are.
[02:45:06.321 --> 02:45:07.062]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:45:07.142 --> 02:45:08.584]  Give me a news headline.
[02:45:08.604 --> 02:45:15.573]  I remember seeing it in AP, but that may have been another one where they were doing the anti-immigration attack on the school and then teaching the kids.
[02:45:15.773 --> 02:45:19.057]  Now, it's not that the cops came in and terrorized your little kids unannounced.
[02:45:19.077 --> 02:45:19.898]  That's not a crime.
[02:45:20.398 --> 02:45:25.425]  The crime is we had to do it because the pro-gun group is the terrorist in the drill.
[02:45:25.785 --> 02:45:29.608]  Well, I don't have an article in front of me because I'm on the road right now, but it just happened.
[02:45:29.628 --> 02:45:32.150]  It was just from the Des Moines Register, and basically they said that
[02:45:55.014 --> 02:46:02.379]  People are calling in saying, if you run this drill, we're actually going to come in and make this, you know, we're actually going to come in and shoot the place up for real.
[02:46:02.939 --> 02:46:18.050]  And they just, in the article, they just... Yeah, that's just the feds probably merging it with their own program and actually calling that in themselves because they like to start in these giant re-education camp drills, the whole country's been being turned into one, to then add reality to then cause even more hysteria.
[02:46:20.017 --> 02:46:22.118]  Yeah, that's what it seemed like to me.
[02:46:22.538 --> 02:46:29.059]  The thing that blew my mind, and it didn't surprise me at the same time, was the fact that they're just like, someone actually death-threatened you.
[02:46:29.399 --> 02:46:34.201]  I had a friend in high school who called in a bomb threat just to, you know, because he wanted to get out of a test.
[02:46:34.541 --> 02:46:41.183]  This was before 9-11, this was like 1997 or something, you know, and he was just some stupid kid, but you know, he's a felon because of that.
[02:46:41.623 --> 02:46:42.863]  And he's really harmless.
[02:46:43.376 --> 02:46:45.497]  You know, a do-nothing type of guy.
[02:46:46.577 --> 02:46:50.998]  Well, he probably should have a record for that, because that can really cause a lot of problems.
[02:46:51.038 --> 02:46:52.879]  I appreciate your call, but good to hear from you, Kyle.
[02:46:53.519 --> 02:47:01.621]  You know, sometimes I'm out in public, and usually I've got to go somewhere, but I was gassing up my car a few days ago, and a guy came over and said, Alex, I want to thank you for everything.
[02:47:01.661 --> 02:47:03.622]  He goes back in, gets something, and he's coming back out.
[02:47:03.682 --> 02:47:04.742]  I said, hey, come here and talk to me.
[02:47:05.503 --> 02:47:06.323]  How long have you been a listener?
[02:47:07.145 --> 02:47:07.545]  We're good to go.
[02:47:24.875 --> 02:47:28.537]  And I've got all these, you know, disabilities and things, you know, from the war.
[02:47:29.398 --> 02:47:38.203]  And he said, then I started smoking marijuana and I got caught with a little bit of it and I fought it because it was medical marijuana and I had my medical marijuana card.
[02:47:39.083 --> 02:47:41.325]  And he said they put me in jail for two years.
[02:47:42.325 --> 02:47:46.608]  And he said, but they were releasing carjackers and all these other criminals.
[02:47:47.606 --> 02:47:48.307]  After months.
[02:47:49.287 --> 02:47:50.248]  And see, but that's true.
[02:47:50.268 --> 02:47:55.913]  You look at the statistics, you get caught with some marijuana in places like Texas, a lot of times they throw the book at you.
[02:47:56.293 --> 02:47:58.054]  He's a veteran, now a felon.
[02:47:58.575 --> 02:47:59.635]  Two years in jail.
[02:48:00.676 --> 02:48:04.900]  He was I think 70-something days in the county jail before he went to prison fighting it.
[02:48:05.640 --> 02:48:07.200]  Because he fought it, they just kept him in jail.
[02:48:07.220 --> 02:48:08.901]  Because he's a good worker, see?
[02:48:09.161 --> 02:48:12.162]  He'll make nice license plates and nice furniture.
[02:48:12.582 --> 02:48:13.742]  He'll do a good job for them.
[02:48:14.302 --> 02:48:15.682]  Sir, I really appreciate your call.
[02:48:15.702 --> 02:48:17.463]  Send me some info on that Iowa situation.
[02:48:17.483 --> 02:48:19.123]  I remember reading about it, but I forget the headline.
[02:48:19.503 --> 02:48:20.904]  Richard in Canada, you're on the air.
[02:48:21.764 --> 02:48:24.505]  Yeah, Alex, how are you doing?
[02:48:24.525 --> 02:48:27.585]  I just watched your film, Fall of the Republic, again.
[02:48:28.405 --> 02:48:29.946]  It's very good, very well done.
[02:48:31.064 --> 02:48:32.045]  Yeah, here's the problem.
[02:48:32.405 --> 02:48:34.806]  I do multiple radio interviews every day.
[02:48:34.826 --> 02:48:36.667]  I'm running everything here in the office.
[02:48:36.707 --> 02:48:37.908]  I got a bunch of new projects we're doing.
[02:48:38.048 --> 02:48:40.690]  And I am doing multiple TV interviews today.
[02:48:53.497 --> 02:49:05.428]  And, uh, I have, you know, I kind of was behind the scenes on, uh, and it kind of got me out of my rhythm of always turning one out every six months because I kind of oversaw Burmese's thing that took about a year longer than it was supposed to.
[02:49:05.448 --> 02:49:08.832]  We did a great job, just we took longer because I wasn't honchoing it.
[02:49:09.312 --> 02:49:11.694]  And then I kind of halfway honchoed police state four.
[02:49:12.776 --> 02:49:14.279]  I mean, I didn't really make those films.
[02:49:14.740 --> 02:49:15.661]  Burma's directed one.
[02:49:15.681 --> 02:49:17.765]  I kind of quasi-helped on it.
[02:49:18.387 --> 02:49:20.411]  And my editors were taken away from the editors.
[02:49:20.451 --> 02:49:22.034]  We hired for him, and they did it.
[02:49:22.655 --> 02:49:23.597]  Aaron and Jacobson.
[02:49:24.525 --> 02:49:26.026]  And then I just kind of got out of my rhythm.
[02:49:26.807 --> 02:49:32.392]  And I've kind of gotten into actually seeing my children about two hours a day, an hour in the morning, an hour or two at night.
[02:49:32.913 --> 02:49:35.455]  And so I just started seeing my children.
[02:49:35.475 --> 02:49:39.859]  I mean, there were whole years where I might just see them on one day on the weekend and a little bit on Sunday.
[02:49:40.660 --> 02:49:43.222]  And I don't know how long I'm gonna be alive.
[02:49:43.242 --> 02:49:49.207]  And so I just, the magicness of being with my children, I just dream about quitting every day.
[02:49:50.888 --> 02:49:58.771]  I don't want the acclaim, the renown, I don't want all this attention, but it's a mission and I go deeper into danger every day.
[02:49:58.791 --> 02:50:05.814]  And I'm just totally sick of everything and my understanding expanding so fast I can hardly even explain the information.
[02:50:07.975 --> 02:50:11.996]  But yes sir, I've got like three films I started and never finished.
[02:50:12.296 --> 02:50:13.197]  I'm just all over the map.
[02:50:13.897 --> 02:50:29.167]  So we've shifted into a system of all these dozens of incredible interviews we've gotten flying around the country and putting those out with some documentation as kind of, you know, presentation films on PrisonPlanet.tv and they're being seen by millions in the aggregate so we're still having the same effect on that front.
[02:50:29.207 --> 02:50:34.030]  But the films are so time intensive because I sit over every edit, every document, every voiceover.
[02:50:34.690 --> 02:50:43.195]  That when I make a film, for months and months and months, I am up here till 2 in the morning, with big black circles around my eyes, eating pizza, and becoming slovenly.
[02:50:44.416 --> 02:50:48.118]  And so I would certainly hope, Richard, to be able to get more of that done for you.
[02:50:48.479 --> 02:50:53.081]  Blue Star, Alex, Bruce, Justin, and others, your call, straight ahead.
[02:50:53.222 --> 02:50:53.962]  Stay with us.
[02:50:54.382 --> 02:50:56.624]  Every minute, folks, I want to run to the South Pacific.
[02:50:57.044 --> 02:50:58.665]  Every minute, I want to punch out of here.
[02:51:00.382 --> 02:51:01.983]  Normal blood pressure, naturally.
[02:51:02.143 --> 02:51:03.284]  How would that make you feel?
[02:51:03.504 --> 02:51:04.865]  I'm Don from New Mexico.
[02:51:05.205 --> 02:51:07.527]  January of 2000, I had a heart attack.
[02:51:07.747 --> 02:51:15.032]  Then my real health began going downhill, and I had high blood pressure, high blood sugar, poor vision, and I really wasn't sleeping well.
[02:51:15.313 --> 02:51:16.674]  I was a mess, pretty much.
[02:51:16.814 --> 02:51:19.476]  Don reports dramatic improvements with hardened body extract.
[02:51:19.556 --> 02:51:24.619]  I started taking hardened body extract, and from within a few days, I started sleeping a lot better.
[02:51:24.879 --> 02:51:29.883]  My blood pressure normalized, my blood sugar normalized, and my sleep really did improve.
[02:51:30.083 --> 02:51:34.967]  Experience these benefits and more when your body gets what it needs with the assistance of Heart and Body Extract.
[02:51:35.187 --> 02:51:39.231]  Order at hbextract.com or call 866-295-5305.
[02:51:39.611 --> 02:51:43.774]  That's hbextract.com or call 866-295-5305.
[02:51:44.315 --> 02:51:47.677]  Folks, I did not expect this at all.
[02:51:47.697 --> 02:51:52.361]  By the 7th, 8th, and 9th day, I saw dramatic improvements from taking Heart and Body Extract.
[02:51:52.401 --> 02:51:55.864]  Details at hbextract.com or call 866-295-5305 for Heart and Body Extract.
[02:52:01.047 --> 02:52:04.688]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:05.068 --> 02:52:08.069]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:08.329 --> 02:52:13.090]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:52:13.110 --> 02:52:19.352]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:19.492 --> 02:52:21.733]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:52:22.273 --> 02:52:22.573]  Tim Geithner?
[02:52:22.593 --> 02:52:22.813]  Bernanke?
[02:52:22.833 --> 02:52:23.393]  They're arsonists!
[02:52:23.413 --> 02:52:24.194]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:24.214 --> 02:52:25.894]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:41.178 --> 02:52:43.019]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:43.319 --> 02:52:48.082]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[02:52:48.462 --> 02:52:57.587]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:52:59.482 --> 02:53:02.523]  The largest part of gaining radiant health is detoxification.
[02:53:02.923 --> 02:53:10.245]  You can drink ionized water, cleanse your intestines, eat a perfect diet, and even take lots of quality supplements and in many instances only make minimal progress.
[02:53:10.746 --> 02:53:14.767]  What is the key to detoxifying your body of mercury, heavy metals, chemicals, and drugs?
[02:53:15.307 --> 02:53:16.347]  It is glutathione.
[02:53:16.747 --> 02:53:20.409]  Glutathione is the master antioxidant used to detoxify your entire body.
[02:53:20.809 --> 02:53:24.170]  It stops free radicals, keeps cells young, and reduces inflammation.
[02:53:24.790 --> 02:53:30.094]  One World Whey Protein Powder may be able to raise your glutathione production by 64% or more.
[02:53:30.594 --> 02:53:37.299]  One World Whey is more effective than any other whey protein powder on the market because it is unheated and from grass-fed cows.
[02:53:37.839 --> 02:53:42.663]  All other, quote, cold-processed whey protein powders have been heated and damaged by 15% or more.
[02:53:44.264 --> 02:53:46.325]  One World Way comes in three delicious flavors.
[02:53:46.665 --> 02:53:48.966]  Call 888-988-3325.
[02:53:48.986 --> 02:53:51.908]  That's 888-988-3325.

[02:53:54.709 --> 02:53:57.631]  That's oneworld, W-H-E-Y, dot com.

[02:54:12.760 --> 02:54:15.963]  Uh, the guys didn't like my short quote that Rudge ran with.
[02:54:16.023 --> 02:54:18.925]  It's, there is no rest when you are involved in reality.
[02:54:18.945 --> 02:54:21.187]  Alex Jones, Austin, Texas, 2-20-11.
[02:54:22.428 --> 02:54:24.529]  Does Urgent Radio six days a week.
[02:54:25.029 --> 02:54:25.910]  Web DVDs.
[02:54:26.651 --> 02:54:30.454]  Okay, uh, let's go ahead now and go to Blue Star in Canada.
[02:54:30.854 --> 02:54:31.955]  Blue Star, you're on the air.
[02:54:33.160 --> 02:54:34.361]  Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:54:34.401 --> 02:54:42.725]  I've got an amazing story that you might want to have this gentleman on your show, but it's got several points of interest for anybody that's going foreclosure.
[02:54:42.745 --> 02:54:46.927]  About three weeks ago, I did an interview with Rico Girón.
[02:54:47.107 --> 02:54:54.391]  He was running for sheriff in New Mexico, and he has taken up, he sued the IRS on racketeering charges and won.
[02:54:55.812 --> 02:55:00.334]  The main point right now where he's at is that he pays his mortgage in full,
[02:55:01.169 --> 02:55:05.236]  The mortgage company gave it to a lawyer, which there was no lawyer's judgment.
[02:55:05.637 --> 02:55:14.131]  He has now told the local sheriff that he is going, not going to leave his property alive, standing up for his and our constitutional rights.
[02:55:15.271 --> 02:55:20.295]  If you want to do a little research on him, his site is RicoOrSheriff.com.
[02:55:20.455 --> 02:55:21.556]  All right, we'll check it out.
[02:55:21.936 --> 02:55:23.197]  Blue Star, very interesting.
[02:55:23.217 --> 02:55:25.379]  More and more people are drawing their line in the sand.
[02:55:25.719 --> 02:55:26.840]  Thank you for that information.
[02:55:27.400 --> 02:55:28.742]  That's what the globalists can't stand.
[02:55:29.602 --> 02:55:31.224]  Alex in Arizona, you're on the air.
[02:55:32.757 --> 02:55:33.418]  Hello, Mr. Jones.
[02:55:33.438 --> 02:55:37.140]  Thank you for this chance to speak to the world of Infowarriors.
[02:55:37.541 --> 02:55:39.682]  I just want to say, see something, say something.
[02:55:39.942 --> 02:55:40.883]  It's absolutely ridiculous.
[02:55:41.223 --> 02:55:54.132]  It's completely exploiting one of the most observable errors in social psychology called the Fundamental Attribution Error, where you overestimate situational attributes to be applying to the personality.
[02:55:55.033 --> 02:55:57.175]  Well, it's saying the public are the terrorists.
[02:55:57.235 --> 02:55:58.896]  It's saying don't trust anyone but the government.
[02:55:59.932 --> 02:56:00.975]  Yes, exactly.
[02:56:01.155 --> 02:56:04.623]  You see, like, if somebody pulls out in front of you, you say, oh, that man must be a bad driver.
[02:56:04.803 --> 02:56:08.412]  Well, no, that man's two-year-old just drank chlorine, and he's rushing to the hospital.
[02:56:09.093 --> 02:56:09.755]  You can't make these...
[02:56:12.207 --> 02:56:13.388]  Well, it's like the realtors.
[02:56:13.468 --> 02:56:19.454]  Every week I see articles where they see guns in a house and call the police where guns are legal because they don't live in reality.
[02:56:19.854 --> 02:56:33.167]  They watch dramas based in New York where you're not allowed to own guns or Chicago and they think that or they see reloading equipment and think it's bombs because it's advertised that it's like winning the lottery to find a terrorist.
[02:56:33.267 --> 02:56:35.389]  So it's a false reality they've been given.
[02:56:36.471 --> 02:56:41.552]  Yeah, I'm just waiting to get pulled over for my Ruger Pride with an American flag sticker on my car.
[02:56:42.493 --> 02:56:46.774]  The second thing I want to say, kind of unrelated, but I don't know if you've ever heard of a S.Q.U.I.D.
[02:56:47.114 --> 02:56:48.274]  It's called S.Q.U.I.D.
[02:56:48.734 --> 02:56:51.135]  Super Conducting Quantum Interference Device.
[02:56:51.155 --> 02:56:59.637]  It essentially measures very minute magnets, or gravitational, I don't know how to say it, magnetic fields.
[02:57:00.338 --> 02:57:05.539]  And I had a researcher, or teacher, who was able to figure out that when you have two people in a room,
[02:57:06.081 --> 02:57:07.522]  And one in person is on the other side of the room.
[02:57:07.842 --> 02:57:15.306]  This machine can measure the other person's heartbeat inside yourself from across the room.
[02:57:16.220 --> 02:57:17.961]  Because it has an electrical field through the heartbeat.
[02:57:18.262 --> 02:57:21.244]  Just going to show that reality isn't what it seems.
[02:57:21.504 --> 02:57:37.077]  We are so... Well, no, I remember eight years ago at four test airports, including Boston Logan, CBS reported they put passive MRIs that scan your brainwaves from a distance, and now they've announced they're going to start rolling these out on the streets, and then that's quackery.
[02:57:37.397 --> 02:57:40.120]  They just say, well, it shows you're a terrorist of the brainwave.
[02:57:40.140 --> 02:57:40.760]  Bye-bye.
[02:57:41.861 --> 02:57:52.407]  You know, they've already disproven the old quackery of the lie detector test, sending hundreds of thousands of innocents to prison, some to the lethal injection gas chamber electric chair.
[02:57:52.907 --> 02:58:00.712]  And so now they just go, we have newfangled equipment, or we train our TSA people to be able to tell by your eye movements and your facial expressions if you're a terrorist.
[02:58:01.152 --> 02:58:05.134]  And then these guys just constantly freaking out thinking they're Superman.
[02:58:05.174 --> 02:58:06.095]  It's all just made up.
[02:58:07.956 --> 02:58:09.837]  As a psychologist myself, it makes me sick.
[02:58:11.345 --> 02:58:22.653]  Well, your point about how they say, you know, a man speeding, a lot of cops now pull somebody over, their dog's dying, their wife's dying, they'll go ahead and arrest them anyways and say, I'm calling for an ambulance.
[02:58:23.374 --> 02:58:32.460]  And the wife's dying of a heart attack, the dog's dying, there's been a lot of famous cases, and they get off in the jury trial and the cop's already mad that they were speeding, so the cop's gotta be right.
[02:58:33.041 --> 02:58:34.562]  And citizens too, look at him speeding!
[02:58:35.062 --> 02:58:37.764]  Meanwhile, his wife's next to him dying in the car, or the husband is.
