[00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.542]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.182 --> 00:00:10.983]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.763 --> 00:00:12.684]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.304 --> 00:00:16.927]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.487 --> 00:00:21.610]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.365 --> 00:00:33.089]  Hard to believe we're already into the fourth live transmission in 2011 before we know it.
[00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:37.672]  We were doing the last broadcast in 2011 and on into 2012.
[00:00:37.712 --> 00:00:44.857]  That's right, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and now it is Wednesday, the kickoff, the fifth day of January 2011.
[00:00:44.977 --> 00:00:49.380]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours, maybe longer.
[00:00:50.041 --> 00:00:53.043]  We have Dr. Nick Begich, always informative, his brother also, U.S.
[00:00:53.523 --> 00:00:53.824]  Senator.
[00:00:55.316 --> 00:00:56.217]  We'll be joining us.
[00:00:56.297 --> 00:01:02.560]  Baggage for many years has been talking about HAARP and weather modification and other secretive programs.
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.784]  Now more and more of what he covered two decades ago and wrote seminal works on from deep research of the U.S.
[00:01:09.824 --> 00:01:12.786]  Patent Office is now public information.
[00:01:13.306 --> 00:01:14.567]  So we'll go even further today.
[00:01:14.587 --> 00:01:18.529]  We'll look into Tesla technologies, you name it, and tie it in to the
[00:01:20.256 --> 00:01:24.359]  Blackbirds and all the other big fish die-offs happening, not just here but around the world.
[00:01:24.519 --> 00:01:28.701]  Mass birds and fish die-offs go global, spark end times panic.
[00:01:28.821 --> 00:01:30.482]  I do not believe that's what's happening here.
[00:01:31.083 --> 00:01:37.987]  And there could be some type of plausible reason this is happening, but it's the liquefaction of their innards.
[00:01:38.027 --> 00:01:42.990]  Many of these birds, when they hit the ground on the snow or on the concrete, there's a pool of blood around them.
[00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.690]  I mean, they have been
[00:01:44.651 --> 00:01:45.432]  Turned into liquid.
[00:01:45.552 --> 00:01:49.114]  And to say that fireworks scared them and they ran into each other and did this?
[00:01:49.614 --> 00:01:52.837]  I've shot similar sized birds with shotguns.
[00:01:54.097 --> 00:02:02.423]  And again, bird hunting, doves, quail, and they get hit by two or three of the BBs, of the hundred or so BBs that go out the end of the shotgun.
[00:02:02.763 --> 00:02:04.104]  They just shoot little holes in them.
[00:02:04.565 --> 00:02:05.905]  Nothing gets pulverized.
[00:02:06.306 --> 00:02:07.607]  Nothing gets liquefied.
[00:02:08.087 --> 00:02:09.768]  In fact, there's usually hardly any blood.
[00:02:09.808 --> 00:02:10.689]  They die so quickly.
[00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:12.910]  And then it makes, you know, delicious eating.
[00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.031]  Don't criticize me for hunting, folks, if you eat any type of meat.
[00:02:16.671 --> 00:02:19.612]  I know you don't want to see the chicken that lives in a cage being tortured to death.
[00:02:19.632 --> 00:02:29.055]  You don't want to actually learn how to butcher a deer, like the old-timers, you know, how to take a chicken out back and cut its head off instantly, you know, dying, and then pull its feathers.
[00:02:29.655 --> 00:02:30.676]  But that's a side issue.
[00:02:30.776 --> 00:02:35.517]  I'm only getting into my experience with shooting birds of similar size and
[00:02:38.021 --> 00:02:39.942]  anatomy to tell you.
[00:02:40.562 --> 00:02:43.804]  Birds don't fall out of trees and then have their insides liquefied.
[00:02:43.824 --> 00:02:44.864]  Okay?
[00:02:45.304 --> 00:02:46.765]  That's not birds running into each other.
[00:02:47.825 --> 00:02:53.528]  I've several times been out at my grandmother's house and she has big glass windows.
[00:02:54.028 --> 00:02:54.828]  The house is still there.
[00:02:54.868 --> 00:02:56.589]  She died about six years ago.
[00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:04.753]  And you will occasionally see a game bird, like a dove, fly into the window and break its neck.
[00:03:05.453 --> 00:03:06.514]  At high speed, boom!
[00:03:06.554 --> 00:03:08.175]  You go out, get it, go ahead and cook it up.
[00:03:09.597 --> 00:03:11.118]  It's not really a meal, but a snack.
[00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:14.421]  And there's no blood, okay?
[00:03:14.661 --> 00:03:15.241]  There's no blood.
[00:03:15.982 --> 00:03:21.347]  I will assure you, birds don't turn into little blood bags and just fall from the sky.
[00:03:21.387 --> 00:03:25.090]  So something's going on here, and I want to get to the bottom of it.
[00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.373]  Okay, and we'll get into all the big developments on that front.
[00:03:29.793 --> 00:03:31.174]  Mike Adams asked the question as well.
[00:03:31.214 --> 00:03:34.476]  We have his article up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPundit.com.
[00:03:34.516 --> 00:03:35.557]  Why are the animals dying?
[00:03:35.617 --> 00:03:38.659]  Birds, fish wiped out and mysterious deaths all over the world.
[00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:45.103]  The National Post out of Canada reports Victorian River mysteriously turns bright green.
[00:03:46.304 --> 00:03:54.270]  There's birds dropping out of the sky en masse all over the world from South America to Northern Europe to the Central and Southern United States.
[00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.971]  A lot of strangeness going on.
[00:03:57.131 --> 00:04:02.152]  A lot of record earthquake activity going on in those areas as well.
[00:04:02.252 --> 00:04:03.353]  Is it associated with that?
[00:04:03.373 --> 00:04:05.613]  A lot of scientists do believe so.
[00:04:05.653 --> 00:04:12.115]  But I'm done talking about that for now because Dr. Nick Baggage will be joining us coming up in T-minus 55 minutes, 46 seconds.
[00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:17.051]  A lot of other news here.
[00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:32.330]  The economic news is particularly worrisome, because it just confirms everything we've been talking about, but shows that things are accelerating, and more and more of the establishment isn't even trying to paint a pretty face on it, and is telling us that it is depressionary.
[00:04:33.431 --> 00:04:38.992]  We'll also get into leaked document, EPA knowingly approved bee killing pesticide.
[00:04:39.533 --> 00:04:40.573]  That is coming up.
[00:04:41.573 --> 00:04:44.794]  We've got some amazing surveillance, police state grid news.
[00:04:45.494 --> 00:04:48.115]  It's all coming up in the next hour.
[00:04:48.135 --> 00:04:53.956]  I'm going to go through all this news in the next hour, then Dr. Nick Baggage, and we'll open the phones up while he's on with us.
[00:04:54.316 --> 00:04:57.837]  And then to the third hour, a whole bunch of political news as well.
[00:04:57.857 --> 00:04:58.277]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.782]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:05:05.103 --> 00:05:05.703]  Number one.
[00:05:06.023 --> 00:05:09.165]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:05:09.445 --> 00:05:10.005]  Number two.
[00:05:10.305 --> 00:05:14.848]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:05:15.188 --> 00:05:15.628]  It's true.
[00:05:15.929 --> 00:05:20.491]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:05:20.811 --> 00:05:21.352]  Number three.
[00:05:21.632 --> 00:05:24.914]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:05:25.214 --> 00:05:28.916]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:05:29.116 --> 00:05:29.677]  Number 4.
[00:05:29.917 --> 00:05:32.281]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:05:32.681 --> 00:05:36.066]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:05:36.366 --> 00:05:36.907]  Number 5.
[00:05:37.147 --> 00:05:41.073]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:05:41.293 --> 00:05:46.060]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:08:11.886 --> 00:08:12.887]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.428 --> 00:08:17.072]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.633 --> 00:08:21.718]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:30.774 --> 00:08:32.155]  Again, thank you for joining us.
[00:08:32.335 --> 00:08:34.957]  It is Wednesday, the fifth day of January, 2011.
[00:08:35.437 --> 00:08:53.447]  Dr. Nick Begich getting into Tesla technology, the massive increase in earthquakes worldwide, the bird deaths, and big mainstream news admissions of governments all over the world setting up harp-type antenna arrays and manipulating the weather.
[00:08:53.528 --> 00:08:58.771]  Now, this has been public for decades, but if you talk about it, the general population out there
[00:09:00.032 --> 00:09:12.793]  uh... had never heard of it so they were conditioned to laugh at you it was public in the patents in the government documents uh... but was not reported on by abc nightly news or the new york times so
[00:09:18.339 --> 00:09:21.781]  Things like that were relegated to the X-Files.
[00:09:22.381 --> 00:09:30.005]  The documents are real, but they stick it in the X-Files show and mix it in with stories about chupacabras and hope that that discredits everything.
[00:09:30.025 --> 00:09:31.486]  That's been the establishment tack.
[00:09:33.567 --> 00:09:33.767]  But...
[00:09:36.795 --> 00:09:48.479]  More and more of this information is coming out, and we know that the main focus has been weather weapons by governments, not just our so-called arm of the New World Order known as the United States government, but other arms of it.
[00:09:48.499 --> 00:09:53.060]  So we're going to be discussing that with Dr. Nick Begich coming up in the next hour.
[00:09:53.701 --> 00:10:00.243]  Another big story I want to get into, leaked document, EPA knowingly approved bee-killing pesticide.
[00:10:01.605 --> 00:10:04.366]  And it's been leaked by EPA insiders.
[00:10:04.406 --> 00:10:06.567]  The EPA admits that the document is real.
[00:10:06.587 --> 00:10:07.588]  They're very upset about it.
[00:10:07.608 --> 00:10:16.952]  That's why they are trying to use the WikiLeaks fiasco as a precedent to basically throw people in prison for life if they leak any type of government documents.
[00:10:16.992 --> 00:10:22.075]  That way the government can just basically kill everything and everybody and get away with it.
[00:10:23.442 --> 00:10:23.922]  I don't know.
[00:10:43.695 --> 00:10:50.205]  ahead of the 2012 so that it's a self-fulfilling prophecy that it's religious that we're going into a depression.
[00:10:50.486 --> 00:10:58.498]  That it's religious that the resources are going to be more and more restricted so that people see it as a foregone conclusion and don't resist.
[00:10:59.764 --> 00:11:13.650]  And as the weather weapons are used on us, and as more and more of the wildlife dies, they can tell us that it's all our fault, and acquiesce to the global government, and do whatever it says for the new green religion, and that everything will be okay.
[00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:20.113]  That's basically what 2012 is all about, and we're going to be breaking it down today.
[00:11:21.013 --> 00:11:23.034]  Separately, another little tidbit of news here.
[00:11:23.374 --> 00:11:28.857]  Florida professor arrested for having a suspicious bagel on a plane.
[00:11:29.597 --> 00:11:32.920]  That's the MSNBC headline.
[00:11:34.501 --> 00:11:38.204]  Passenger claimed man had suspicious package in the overhead compartment.
[00:11:38.305 --> 00:11:39.526]  It was a bagel.
[00:11:40.501 --> 00:11:47.566]  And I've seen comedians, movie stars, you name it, reading, you know, best-selling books about jihadists.
[00:11:48.327 --> 00:11:55.732]  And passengers see an image of a person, you know, wearing a desert garb on a book and see an Anglo reading it.
[00:11:55.912 --> 00:11:58.634]  And the plane is landed and the people are pulled off.
[00:11:58.914 --> 00:12:00.355]  That's just how the globalists want you.
[00:12:00.375 --> 00:12:02.657]  Just the wicked fleeing when none pursueth.
[00:12:03.177 --> 00:12:11.414]  Collapsing in fear from things that are non-existent or that you have a better chance of being struck by lightning than dying from terrorism, even if you believe it's all real.
[00:12:12.489 --> 00:12:31.980]  I mean, through the movies, the culture, the hundreds of TV shows about terrorist attacking and how they're everywhere, and these plots of the heroic CIA and FBI agents torturing people and other things to stop the bad guys, the average person out there, at least was in years past, shaking in fear.
[00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:35.522]  Just five, six years ago, the number one poll
[00:12:36.462 --> 00:12:39.925]  You know, the number one threat that people talked about in national polls was terrorism.
[00:12:40.425 --> 00:12:42.227]  Now it's less than 10% think it's important.
[00:12:42.667 --> 00:12:44.629]  I mean, it's just like getting into it.
[00:12:44.669 --> 00:12:49.032]  It's like imagining that there's flesh-eating zombies, you know, out in the countryside.
[00:12:49.052 --> 00:12:51.154]  Have you ever taken somebody out camping?
[00:12:52.034 --> 00:12:55.958]  Back in college and things, I would take girlfriends camping.
[00:12:56.658 --> 00:12:57.518]  And we'd go with friends.
[00:12:58.358 --> 00:13:04.840]  And I knew a lot of girls from the city who would get spooked by just driving through the countryside or spooked at night.
[00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:07.741]  You know, they thought that grizzly bears were going to come out and eat them.
[00:13:08.281 --> 00:13:12.022]  And that's because their ancient instincts are to be afraid out in the woods.
[00:13:12.582 --> 00:13:17.324]  But man's killed everything that's basically dangerous except for rattlesnakes and things.
[00:13:17.784 --> 00:13:19.664]  But they're never scared of something that's actually a threat.
[00:13:19.944 --> 00:13:21.225]  It's just scared of the dark.
[00:13:21.745 --> 00:13:24.826]  And so that's what this national or international
[00:13:25.846 --> 00:13:47.651]  Mass psychosis is, is they just take the instincts of man's fear of the dark and then put a turban or a burqa on it and the media can just show you an image of a Muslim in desert garb and everyone just falls down groveling in fear and basically soils themselves and begins crying out for men in black uniforms to save them.
[00:13:47.991 --> 00:13:51.952]  Meanwhile it's the men in black uniforms financing, in almost every case, the Muslim extremist.
[00:13:53.416 --> 00:13:56.457]  So that, of course, is a major issue.
[00:13:57.117 --> 00:14:01.179]  Florida professor arrested for having a suspicious bagel.
[00:14:01.839 --> 00:14:03.200]  Bagels are with Al Qaeda now.
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:07.061]  Passengers claim man had suspicious package in the overhead compartment.
[00:14:07.101 --> 00:14:09.762]  So if you see something, say something.
[00:14:10.342 --> 00:14:13.826]  And we now have confirmed the Walmarts all over the country are beginning to phase in.
[00:14:14.106 --> 00:14:15.748]  Telescreens at every checkout counter.
[00:14:16.208 --> 00:14:20.352]  And then some big giant ones at the back of Walmart with government announcements.
[00:14:20.413 --> 00:14:21.193]  Watch everyone.
[00:14:21.253 --> 00:14:22.555]  Oh my gosh, you're under danger.
[00:14:22.575 --> 00:14:28.381]  And this will intensify the paranoids out there to just run around in fear, looking around corners.
[00:14:30.162 --> 00:14:39.565]  And creeping through the clothing aisles and the auto parts area, just looking under every can of Folgers coffee for a deadly Al-Qaeda.
[00:14:40.125 --> 00:14:53.028]  And so, suddenly, as part of this mass hallucination that's enforced by the media and the thousands of anti-terror drills where they'll blow up a bus in the middle of the town and announce for a few hours terrorists have hit, and they'll lock down the schools.
[00:14:53.468 --> 00:14:56.929]  This happens just right up in Belton, close to where I live, just north of me.
[00:14:57.769 --> 00:14:59.511]  I got word about one and went to the drill.
[00:14:59.551 --> 00:15:11.399]  They blew up a car and blew up some stuff and the mayor announced terrorists were hitting and it was even in the paper the next day that terrorists had hit, but in the last paragraph of a long half-page story it said, by the way, it was just a drill.
[00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:24.830]  So, it hits people with suspended disbelief that Al-Cieda has hit them and hit them hard, so that then, a few years later, they're on a plane and see a guy with a bagel and, oh, the bagel's gonna get me!
[00:15:25.612 --> 00:15:28.053]  I mean, they see that bagel and suddenly it's wearing a turban.
[00:15:28.333 --> 00:15:29.734]  Suddenly it's got a big black beard.
[00:15:30.194 --> 00:15:33.775]  Sesame seeds are seen as legions of Al-Qaeda forces.
[00:15:34.695 --> 00:15:51.942]  Meanwhile, all sorts of tyranny, death, mass murder, bad drug interactions, flesh-eating bacteria from overuse of antibiotics, a massive plague all over the country, deaths just all over the place, rocket attacks, truck bombs, machine-gunning deaths, police and media being killed on the U.S.
[00:15:52.002 --> 00:15:52.962]  border, 28,000 deaths and growing.
[00:15:55.003 --> 00:15:57.806]  Dogs and cats raining, you know, out of the sky, basically.
[00:15:58.186 --> 00:15:59.307]  And that's no issue.
[00:15:59.687 --> 00:16:00.368]  No problem.
[00:16:00.748 --> 00:16:01.109]  Nothing.
[00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:03.351]  Out of sight, out of mind.
[00:16:03.911 --> 00:16:10.898]  But a bagel can now, like a mirage, just morph into some type of deadly gorgon.
[00:16:12.459 --> 00:16:16.183]  A Florida professor was arrested and removed from a plane Monday.
[00:16:17.063 --> 00:16:18.645]  Notice he was arrested.
[00:16:20.888 --> 00:16:22.188]  Not just yet.
[00:16:23.229 --> 00:16:25.769]  Well, you never can be too safe about the terrorist.
[00:16:25.809 --> 00:16:36.252]  And then you go, well, in every case we've studied, the government's protecting them and funding them and their commanders, Muslim extremists are always secretly hanging out at the Pentagon and military bases.
[00:16:36.632 --> 00:16:37.412]  Here it's all confirmed.
[00:16:37.792 --> 00:16:38.592]  Let's just not look at that.
[00:16:38.892 --> 00:16:40.633]  Isn't it much more fun to be scared of the bagel?
[00:16:44.096 --> 00:16:51.197]  So again, just be glad a Florida professor was arrested and removed from a plane Monday after his fellow passengers...
[00:16:52.389 --> 00:16:54.690]  And see, government, like attack dogs, have been trained.
[00:16:54.930 --> 00:17:00.252]  The most ridiculous phone call, the most ridiculous warning, they hyperventilate over all of that and get all upset.
[00:17:00.513 --> 00:17:15.599]  But when I call the FBI Threat Fusion Center that Janet Napolitano is handing out nationwide at universities and high schools and government buildings and private corporations, if you see anything suspicious or have any tips about terrorism, call.
[00:17:15.919 --> 00:17:21.662]  And so I call and say, OK, here's Fox News, number three in Al Qaeda, number one overall operationally.
[00:17:22.162 --> 00:17:35.213]  Ammar al-Awlaki is in every case admittedly hanging out secretly at the Pentagon, and then commanding the Fort Hood attack, the underwear bomber, the shoe bomber, and I'd like to send you this, and the guy's just like, mm-hmm, click, and hangs up.
[00:17:35.914 --> 00:17:37.795]  So you give them a real terror threat.
[00:17:38.036 --> 00:17:43.921]  I mean, you tell them right where the terrorists are, and exactly what's going on, and admitted fact, and they just don't want to hear it.
[00:17:44.201 --> 00:17:47.604]  But if you say a bagel's scary, people are going to jail.
[00:17:50.794 --> 00:17:57.758]  Just like every week I see articles, sometimes even more, where neighbors are walking through, generally through some suburb, middle class area.
[00:17:58.139 --> 00:18:03.902]  It's almost always an old man who thinks they're still in America, who's in their tanker and garage cleaning a rifle.
[00:18:04.603 --> 00:18:06.524]  Neighbors sees it, they call the SWAT team.
[00:18:06.824 --> 00:18:08.685]  The old man's lucky if he makes it out alive.
[00:18:08.725 --> 00:18:10.927]  Sometimes they run up and just shoot him right there on the spot.
[00:18:11.327 --> 00:18:13.028]  Or they're holding a garden hose watering.
[00:18:13.428 --> 00:18:15.029]  Now the end of it looks like a gun barrel.
[00:18:15.069 --> 00:18:16.050]  Police come and kill him.
[00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:16.851]  San Francisco.
[00:18:17.791 --> 00:18:18.752]  It's always the same MO.
[00:18:20.069 --> 00:18:30.915]  Or a carpet cleaner's in your house or the cable guy and sees a gun case and calls the police and says your shotgun's a machine gun and they show up and a lot of times they go ahead and confiscate the guns.
[00:18:30.955 --> 00:18:38.500]  Well, you got eight guns and we found 2,000 rounds of ammo and the local police spokesman will go out and have a press conference and say, we have arrested Mr. Johnson.
[00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:39.340]  He had an arsenal.
[00:18:39.861 --> 00:18:42.582]  And then people say, is there a law against those?
[00:18:43.483 --> 00:18:44.504]  The press never asked that.
[00:18:44.704 --> 00:18:46.765]  They just sit there going, oh my gosh.
[00:18:47.918 --> 00:18:50.940]  And you'll hear the radio announcers and the local TV news people.
[00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:56.984]  They always have like that happy sounding announcer going, Mr. Johnson was taken into custody by police officers.
[00:18:57.524 --> 00:19:04.269]  I heard him last night on the radio announcing, oh, they're trying to pass a law in Texas that if you've ever had a DWI, it'll be marked on your license.
[00:19:04.689 --> 00:19:05.409]  Isn't that good?
[00:19:05.429 --> 00:19:09.032]  And they had so much enjoyment talking about the police state marking of everything.
[00:19:09.052 --> 00:19:09.852]  We know the history of that.
[00:19:09.892 --> 00:19:10.633]  It's very dangerous.
[00:19:10.933 --> 00:19:11.733]  Next, what will it be?
[00:19:11.793 --> 00:19:15.276]  Yellow stars for anybody ever got pulled over and had one beer?
[00:19:16.334 --> 00:19:21.478]  Oh yeah, they're lowering it down to any alcohol all over the country through the federal lobbying.
[00:19:22.399 --> 00:19:24.501]  But again, they alerted the crew about the bagel.
[00:19:24.561 --> 00:19:26.482]  Crew members thought they had a suspicious package.
[00:19:27.303 --> 00:19:31.746]  And the suspicious package turned out to be keys, a bagel, and cream cheese, and a hat.
[00:19:33.948 --> 00:19:36.610]  I've got the FBI warning flyers.
[00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:41.674]  It says blue jeans, is polite, is a nice guy, has a cell phone.
[00:19:41.694 --> 00:19:44.096]  I have another training manual.
[00:19:44.156 --> 00:19:45.738]  It says a woman with a baby carriage.
[00:19:47.892 --> 00:19:54.656]  We're going to break it all down when we come back, but again, land of the cowards, home of the slaves, if we let the globalists turn us into that.
[00:19:54.916 --> 00:19:59.879]  Now I'm going to get into the incredible economic news after this break, and believe me, it is super important.
[00:20:01.121 --> 00:20:07.585]  One of the most potent ways to lower blood pressure is to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme in the body, also called ACE.
[00:20:07.945 --> 00:20:12.168]  In nature, there are a group of proteins found in unheated whey that inhibit the ACE enzyme.
[00:20:12.508 --> 00:20:15.309]  The most potent ACE inhibitor to date is Lactokinin.
[00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:26.156]  While Lactokinin does not have the inhibitory potency of synthetic drugs commonly used in the treatment of hypertension, this naturally occurring whey peptide may be able to help keep blood pressure normal.
[00:20:26.636 --> 00:20:30.518]  The most powerful whey protein supplement on the market is One World Whey.
[00:20:30.818 --> 00:20:35.521]  One World Whey is the first ever unheated whey protein powder from grass-fed cows.
[00:20:36.281 --> 00:20:39.083]  One World Whey is easily digested and tastes delicious.
[00:20:39.783 --> 00:20:46.106]  Use One World Whey to support your exercise or weight loss goals, your optimal blood pressure, energy, endurance, and mood.
[00:20:46.567 --> 00:20:47.567]  To order, call 888-988-3325.
[00:20:47.587 --> 00:20:47.907]  That's 888-988-3325.
[00:20:47.927 --> 00:20:48.168]  Or visit
[00:20:54.731 --> 00:20:56.092]  OneWorldWay.com.
[00:20:56.312 --> 00:20:59.615]  That's OneWorldW-H-E-Y.com.
[00:20:59.975 --> 00:21:00.335]  Good day.
[00:21:00.515 --> 00:21:01.976]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:21:02.076 --> 00:21:03.317]  January 5th, 2011.
[00:21:03.758 --> 00:21:04.658]  Gold opened this morning at $1380.
[00:21:04.718 --> 00:21:07.420]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $1415.76, $707.88 for a half-ounce, or $353.94 for a quarter-ounce.
[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:07.841]  That's $1415.76, $707.88, or $353.94.
[00:21:19.685 --> 00:21:23.450]  Again, the Congressional Budget Office sounds the alarm, warning of Greek-style U.S.
[00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:24.311]  debt crises.
[00:21:24.672 --> 00:21:26.795]  CBO is drawing a parallel between U.S.
[00:21:26.855 --> 00:21:28.958]  economy and the Greek economic meltdown.
[00:21:29.278 --> 00:21:34.285]  Debt to GDP climbing to unfamiliar territory and deficits rising to unsupportable levels.
[00:21:34.605 --> 00:21:35.586]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:21:35.606 --> 00:21:41.371]  The Federal Debt and Risk of Financial Crises document the CBO has published is a must-read for every American.
[00:21:41.571 --> 00:21:47.456]  Covering the risks of deficit spending, aging population, and rising interest rates spells economic disaster.
[00:21:47.736 --> 00:21:48.377]  Call today at 800-686-2237.
[00:21:48.397 --> 00:21:49.078]  I'll send it free.
[00:21:49.098 --> 00:21:49.778]  Again, call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:49.838 --> 00:21:50.879]  Ask for the CBO document.
[00:21:50.899 --> 00:21:51.119]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.187 --> 00:22:04.791]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:22:05.191 --> 00:22:08.214]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:22:08.435 --> 00:22:13.220]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:19.486]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:22:19.646 --> 00:22:21.889]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:22:22.409 --> 00:22:22.689]  Tim Geithner?
[00:22:22.709 --> 00:22:22.949]  Bernanke?
[00:22:22.969 --> 00:22:23.509]  They're arsonists!
[00:22:23.529 --> 00:22:24.330]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:26.670]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:22:41.314 --> 00:22:45.236]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[00:22:45.676 --> 00:22:48.277]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:22:48.577 --> 00:22:57.941]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv

[00:23:54.932 --> 00:23:57.173]  The next generation of alternative smoking.
[00:24:01.116 --> 00:24:03.358]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:24:03.878 --> 00:24:09.482]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:09.562 --> 00:24:13.005]  Show in the name of keeping us safe from Arab extremists.
[00:24:14.352 --> 00:24:15.933]  Our borders are still wide open.
[00:24:15.973 --> 00:24:18.255]  It's been confirmed in major news reports.
[00:24:18.275 --> 00:24:22.317]  I'm going to get Glenn Spencer back on to cover this from American Patrol in the next few weeks.
[00:24:22.777 --> 00:24:30.482]  That the 2,000 National Guard who are on the border are not allowed to talk to anybody, interdict anyone.
[00:24:30.843 --> 00:24:33.965]  They must sit in one spot driving white trucks.
[00:24:34.645 --> 00:24:34.865]  I don't
[00:24:50.664 --> 00:24:55.668]  And Reuters and Fox did report two years ago that illegal aliens were hired to build the fence.
[00:24:56.208 --> 00:24:57.449]  So this is a complete joke.
[00:24:57.729 --> 00:25:12.099]  It's also been reported that illegal aliens, when they are arrested in the few staged raids they have every year of meatpacking plants and other things, that ICE then takes them and gives them green cards on the spot and gives them jobs in the federal government.
[00:25:12.859 --> 00:25:13.860]  It's total stunts.
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:16.802]  They arrest them, they apologize, and they give them a job.
[00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:20.431]  I mean, it's just all completely staged.
[00:25:20.951 --> 00:25:21.231]  Okay?
[00:25:21.511 --> 00:25:22.372]  That's wide open.
[00:25:22.832 --> 00:25:25.953]  But then they've got to absolutely stick their hands down your pants.
[00:25:25.973 --> 00:25:27.553]  They've got to arrest you for the bagel.
[00:25:28.154 --> 00:25:29.074]  They've got to do all.
[00:25:29.094 --> 00:25:45.820]  They've got to spend tens of billions of dollars putting in threat fusion centers and federalizing all the police and two billion in New York and more than two billion in Boston and a billion plus in Houston and eight hundred plus million in Dallas in the last few years, putting in face scanning, license plate reading cameras.
[00:25:47.717 --> 00:26:03.245]  And all these political insiders from Homeland Security from the last administration and the current administration are getting the money from it and they're training police that domestic groups, militias, conservatives are going to kill police any minute and attack all the police stations.
[00:26:04.245 --> 00:26:15.871]  Now, the public's told that all of this police state's been set up for the scary men running around, you know, from Team America, imaginary Muppets.
[00:26:17.711 --> 00:26:21.985]  This, this, this vapor that they've got everybody running from.
[00:26:23.464 --> 00:26:40.107]  And then meanwhile, though, when you really get behind the closed doors and all the manuals and documents that we've published, ad infinitum, that have been linked to us, it's a total obsession with gun owners, returning veterans, conservatives, libertarians, and then the ACLU and anti-war groups and anti-abortion groups and pro-abortion groups.
[00:26:40.387 --> 00:26:43.668]  Basically, if you are politically involved, they're scared to death of you.
[00:26:43.948 --> 00:26:46.089]  How dare an American be politically involved?
[00:26:46.389 --> 00:26:52.690]  If you're one of the top Republicans in Pennsylvania on the legislature and you're organizing Tea Parties calling for cut taxes.
[00:26:53.755 --> 00:26:54.676]  You are surveilled.
[00:26:54.756 --> 00:26:55.677]  You are wiretapped.
[00:26:55.757 --> 00:26:56.437]  You are watched.
[00:26:56.858 --> 00:27:04.265]  And if they can't get the state police to do it, who, by the way, refused, and let me give you the inside scoop, it was the Pennsylvania State Police that leaked that to the legislature.
[00:27:04.625 --> 00:27:05.746]  Um, couldn't tell you that.
[00:27:05.946 --> 00:27:06.827]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:27:07.588 --> 00:27:11.311]  They couldn't get the state police to spy on the legislature.
[00:27:11.371 --> 00:27:16.195]  I mean, the state police may be brainwashed in Pennsylvania, but they understood that was illegal.
[00:27:17.316 --> 00:27:18.658]  That's the elected government.
[00:27:18.698 --> 00:27:19.738]  That is the government.
[00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:20.910]  I think?
[00:27:35.683 --> 00:27:38.325]  That's what this whole police state grid's for.
[00:27:38.645 --> 00:27:40.146]  Get it through your heads.
[00:27:40.446 --> 00:27:54.717]  Those of you out there that have a relished obsession, a psychological, mentally ill, twit fetish, I don't know what to call it, who love to watch all the movies with the fictitious bad men and all the simulated terror attacks.
[00:27:56.584 --> 00:27:57.745]  It's not real, okay?
[00:27:58.506 --> 00:27:59.166]  It's not real.
[00:27:59.446 --> 00:28:00.007]  It's not real.
[00:28:00.187 --> 00:28:02.549]  And even if it was real, don't take my liberties.
[00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:04.250]  I'll take the danger.
[00:28:04.651 --> 00:28:10.616]  Just like 300 plus thousand people die a year in cars, I still put my kids in the car every day and drive them all over town.
[00:28:11.056 --> 00:28:15.820]  And I try to drive safe and they're my little sweetie pies, but I'll take the risk of the liberty of travel.
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:17.581]  And that's how our society's set up.
[00:28:19.503 --> 00:28:21.625]  Do terrorists kill 300,000 people a year?
[00:28:21.645 --> 00:28:23.406]  Alright, I'm done ranting.
[00:28:23.967 --> 00:28:25.448]  I apologize, I'm out of control today.
[00:28:27.261 --> 00:28:28.302]  It's just I'm sick of it.
[00:28:28.562 --> 00:28:50.823]  And if you have any doubts about who's behind the terror, or your friends and family have any doubts, get the film Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror on DVD at Infowars.com, and your purchase also supports our operation, and you are authorized, in fact I beg of thee, to use a Lindsay Williams line, I beg of thee to get the DVD
[00:28:52.176 --> 00:29:01.899]  And to make copies of it, and to put it on AXS television, or call your local AXS, go find the libertarian producers that are already there and get them to air it!
[00:29:02.099 --> 00:29:03.039]  Just get it done!
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:06.441]  Americans can always get it done before, let's get it done this time!
[00:29:06.721 --> 00:29:10.182]  Let's wake up out of our malaise, wake up out of our trance and get angry!
[00:29:10.562 --> 00:29:11.722]  Terror storm!
[00:29:11.742 --> 00:29:15.083]  It's just filled with all these mainline government admissions.
[00:29:15.623 --> 00:29:18.924]  Admissions where our government admits they staged terror attacks in history.
[00:29:19.485 --> 00:29:20.405]  And other governments doing it.
[00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:30.887]  In-game, Obama Deception, Invisible Empire, all incredible films, massively discounted at InfoWars.com on the online video bookstore shopping cart.
[00:29:31.167 --> 00:29:35.890]  We got Patriot t-shirts, everything to spread the word, and your support also makes this operation possible.
[00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:43.795]  And don't forget, for a few more weeks, we're running that New Year's special, five-plus months free at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[00:29:44.076 --> 00:29:46.777]  PrisonPlanet.tv, go check out all the key info today.
[00:29:46.978 --> 00:29:48.659]  We'll be back with the economy news, I promise.
[00:29:48.879 --> 00:29:49.699]  Straight ahead, stay with us.
[00:29:51.038 --> 00:29:54.027]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:57.659]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.345 --> 00:30:03.948]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:30:04.348 --> 00:30:09.313]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:30:09.673 --> 00:30:11.415]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:30:11.735 --> 00:30:16.540]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:17.701]  How much do you want?
[00:30:17.922 --> 00:30:18.662]  When do you want it?
[00:30:19.043 --> 00:30:20.644]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:30:20.924 --> 00:30:21.745]  When will you need it?
[00:30:22.006 --> 00:30:24.068]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:30:24.208 --> 00:30:25.189]  Will there be any food?
[00:30:25.529 --> 00:30:29.431]  Will it make your children sick if there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself?
[00:30:29.591 --> 00:30:32.112]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:30:32.312 --> 00:30:35.514]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:30:35.914 --> 00:30:39.395]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:30:39.716 --> 00:30:40.716]  How much will you need?
[00:30:40.956 --> 00:30:41.556]  We don't know.
[00:30:41.857 --> 00:30:42.777]  How much do you want?
[00:30:42.957 --> 00:30:43.677]  All you can get.
[00:30:43.697 --> 00:30:44.718]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:44.978 --> 00:30:47.739]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:30:48.019 --> 00:30:50.641]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:30:50.661 --> 00:30:51.621]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:31:00.362 --> 00:31:04.023]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[00:31:04.183 --> 00:31:08.224]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[00:31:08.464 --> 00:31:13.505]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[00:31:13.585 --> 00:31:18.327]  Not looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[00:31:19.107 --> 00:31:26.109]  Not worried about them moving south, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[00:31:28.906 --> 00:31:33.311]  I'm looking for America.
[00:31:34.413 --> 00:31:36.275]  Wear American and be proud.
[00:31:36.395 --> 00:31:39.038]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[00:31:39.879 --> 00:31:42.862]  Land of the free and the home of the brave.
[00:31:43.283 --> 00:31:47.027]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[00:31:54.853 --> 00:31:59.428]  And you, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[00:32:00.063 --> 00:32:04.306]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:32:04.606 --> 00:32:05.226]  Number one.
[00:32:05.526 --> 00:32:08.688]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:32:08.949 --> 00:32:09.529]  Number two.
[00:32:09.809 --> 00:32:14.372]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:32:14.712 --> 00:32:15.153]  It's true.
[00:32:15.453 --> 00:32:20.016]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:20.316 --> 00:32:20.876]  Number three.
[00:32:21.156 --> 00:32:24.438]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:32:24.739 --> 00:32:28.441]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:32:28.641 --> 00:32:29.182]  Number 4.
[00:32:29.422 --> 00:32:31.804]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:32:32.204 --> 00:32:35.587]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:35.867 --> 00:32:36.088]  Number 5.
[00:32:36.668 --> 00:32:40.591]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:32:40.812 --> 00:32:45.576]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:32:45.856 --> 00:32:49.882]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:50.022 --> 00:32:51.584]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:51.825 --> 00:32:53.908]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:32:54.068 --> 00:32:56.431]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:33:04.793 --> 00:33:05.494]  Big Brother.
[00:33:05.795 --> 00:33:07.057]  Mainstream media.
[00:33:07.458 --> 00:33:08.621]  Government cover-ups.
[00:33:08.841 --> 00:33:09.823]  You want answers?
[00:33:10.123 --> 00:33:11.246]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:12.187 --> 00:33:16.335]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:23.953 --> 00:33:25.754]  What do you think I'm broke?
[00:33:25.794 --> 00:33:27.195]  If there's a new way...
[00:33:55.179 --> 00:33:57.364]  That'll work this time!
[00:34:07.057 --> 00:34:13.299]  It's good to know Dave Mustaine is a Christian and is on board to fight against the New World Order.
[00:34:13.319 --> 00:34:16.741]  Good to know that Muse is on board to fight against the New World Order.
[00:34:17.101 --> 00:34:18.241]  Big supporter of the show.
[00:34:18.261 --> 00:34:18.981]  We salute them.
[00:34:19.942 --> 00:34:20.202]  Why?
[00:34:20.282 --> 00:34:23.183]  I picked somebody out there.
[00:34:23.203 --> 00:34:25.604]  I know Bob Dylan doesn't like the New World Order.
[00:34:26.704 --> 00:34:28.985]  I know so many other people don't like the New World Order.
[00:34:29.045 --> 00:34:32.326]  Our own Jimmy Vaughn, right here in Austin, Tejas.
[00:34:32.887 --> 00:34:33.747]  He doesn't like it either.
[00:34:35.507 --> 00:34:37.469]  I'll be the first in line.
[00:34:39.551 --> 00:34:41.893]  Okay, we are back live, getting serious here.
[00:34:42.033 --> 00:34:45.236]  You know, I'm thinking about why I've been goofing off a little bit more on the show.
[00:34:45.276 --> 00:34:50.200]  Now, I'm going to be quite honest, I've analyzed, psychoanalyzed my own psychological condition.
[00:34:50.741 --> 00:34:57.607]  And that's one of a hardcore realist, a hard charger who believes in liberty and knows the power of the individual dynamic spirit of humanity.
[00:35:00.063 --> 00:35:05.124]  Highly motivated, but all work and no play makes a jacked old boy.
[00:35:06.244 --> 00:35:08.385]  And I've got to have a little fun sometimes here.
[00:35:08.425 --> 00:35:10.385]  They call it Gallo's humor and that's what it is.
[00:35:10.405 --> 00:35:23.208]  I do all the research, analyze late into the night, hours of research this morning, and then I get in here with the stacks of news and it is a paradox that I then don't want to go back over it again.
[00:35:24.888 --> 00:35:25.709]  It is a paradox.
[00:35:25.829 --> 00:35:27.769]  I don't want to have to cover what I'm about to cover.
[00:35:31.044 --> 00:35:33.345]  It is kind of like a dog revisiting his vomit.
[00:35:34.205 --> 00:35:35.145]  But I have to.
[00:35:35.866 --> 00:35:43.508]  I have to, because we've got to cover it, we've got to resist it, and admitting the tyranny, admitting the problem, is half the solution.
[00:35:43.948 --> 00:35:51.891]  Then, overcoming the problem and restoring liberty is the full solution in that eloquent equation.
[00:35:52.311 --> 00:35:55.652]  Okay, let's get into Associated Press, let's get into the hardcore news.
[00:35:57.366 --> 00:36:05.008]  World Bank issues its first yon bonds in Hong Kong.
[00:36:05.748 --> 00:36:10.629]  Now, before I get into this AP article, I want to lay this out a little bit.
[00:36:11.449 --> 00:36:13.830]  Again, it would not do justice to just read that one headline.
[00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:22.892]  For those that may not know, a month ago, the Ruskies and the Chicoms made a deal
[00:36:24.088 --> 00:36:32.233]  That they were not going to engage in any trade between their two nations in the world reserve currency, the dollar.
[00:36:32.874 --> 00:36:46.843]  And when they announced that, and then went ahead with it two weeks later, now two weeks ago, it fired one of the biggest, fattest, longest black nails into the lid of the coffin and the corpse that is the dollar.
[00:36:47.463 --> 00:36:48.984]  Now, the globalists have always planned this.
[00:36:49.004 --> 00:36:51.725]  The trilaterals back in the 70s talked about how they'd do it.
[00:36:52.105 --> 00:36:54.626]  They will also destroy the other currencies later.
[00:36:55.526 --> 00:37:06.030]  And as the dollar sucks down into this vortex, this black hole, it will then suck in the other currencies with it, and we'll be left with a global SDR backed by a basket of global taxes.
[00:37:07.051 --> 00:37:11.413]  VAT International, VAT National, a raft of carbon taxes.
[00:37:12.273 --> 00:37:13.293]  The list goes on and on.
[00:37:13.333 --> 00:37:14.674]  Travel taxes, you name it.
[00:37:15.686 --> 00:37:25.453]  Security taxes, the proliferation of this in financial and military conquest by the banking board.
[00:37:26.696 --> 00:37:46.310]  And so now you've seen a rapid scurrying from the dollar, and then all the hundred plus, 160 plus countries that have invested mainly in the dollar, as the dollar plunges, they then get desperate and go buy more dollars trying to prop it up, but now the consensus, as you watch the dollar and the aggregate go down over time, as George Soros said last year,
[00:37:46.690 --> 00:37:47.851]  And we aired it here last year.
[00:37:47.891 --> 00:37:49.672]  For some reason it's getting a bunch of attention now.
[00:37:50.032 --> 00:37:52.193]  Heard it on local talk radio this morning.
[00:37:52.233 --> 00:37:53.134]  I was on Man Cow.
[00:37:53.214 --> 00:37:54.155]  He wanted to talk about it.
[00:37:54.535 --> 00:38:03.720]  George Soros saying, yes, it is ideal to have the dollar slowly decline and China replace the United States as the world consumers.
[00:38:04.941 --> 00:38:06.842]  It's more of a Henry Kissinger type imitation.
[00:38:07.383 --> 00:38:09.504]  So that's finally getting attention because, you know,
[00:38:10.771 --> 00:38:12.872]  A year ago it hadn't quite yet started to unfold.
[00:38:12.913 --> 00:38:16.715]  Now people are thinking it's a new clip since we posted it two days ago.
[00:38:17.676 --> 00:38:26.302]  It's amazing to watch how more and more of this radio show, my websites, InfoWars.com and PresentPlanet.com, are setting the media agenda.
[00:38:27.823 --> 00:38:29.264]  We really are beginning to do that.
[00:38:29.904 --> 00:38:32.386]  Similar to what the Drudge Report does, DrudgeReport.com.
[00:38:32.886 --> 00:38:38.090]  And I was sitting there after I got out of the shower, after I went for a jog this morning, and I was looking at myself in the mirror and I'm like,
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:44.843]  I don't like this power.
[00:38:45.143 --> 00:38:45.804]  It's freaky.
[00:38:47.825 --> 00:38:53.549]  And I can't imagine a lot of people out there get power and go wild and become very arrogant and self-assured.
[00:38:53.589 --> 00:38:55.851]  It's the opposite with Alejandro Jones.
[00:39:02.455 --> 00:39:04.657]  Makes me think of a line from Full Metal Jacket.
[00:39:06.653 --> 00:39:14.177]  It's a good thing God gave us so much power to keep heaven stocked with fresh souls.
[00:39:16.658 --> 00:39:17.759]  But this is real power.
[00:39:19.179 --> 00:39:21.381]  And I don't want to keep heaven stocked with fresh souls.
[00:39:22.881 --> 00:39:23.782]  It's weird.
[00:39:25.923 --> 00:39:26.923]  I don't feel worthy.
[00:39:27.004 --> 00:39:31.146]  I'm not worthy to have this much power and watch the power growing.
[00:39:32.346 --> 00:39:35.208]  And I really am going to try to focus and take it to the next level.
[00:39:36.584 --> 00:39:38.265]  But it is creepy, I have to tell you.
[00:39:40.386 --> 00:39:40.887]  Very creepy.
[00:39:42.288 --> 00:39:46.570]  Pretty much anything we cover or push now enters the news cycle and becomes a major news story.
[00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:47.891]  We've hit the zeitgeist.
[00:39:48.131 --> 00:39:51.974]  I mean, it's like hitting a hole in one every day.
[00:39:51.994 --> 00:39:58.237]  Do you realize the amount of eyes and surveillance and spin coming at us?
[00:39:58.317 --> 00:39:59.778]  And they may destroy me soon.
[00:39:59.979 --> 00:40:00.359]  I don't know.
[00:40:01.667 --> 00:40:04.669]  But if they do, that's part of the plan, because it's God's plan.
[00:40:04.770 --> 00:40:05.530]  I'm not worried about it.
[00:40:05.690 --> 00:40:06.591]  I did my mission.
[00:40:06.971 --> 00:40:10.975]  I woke people up, thanks to you working with us symbiotically to spread the word.
[00:40:11.575 --> 00:40:18.461]  And they can destroy me individually in my name or whatever they cook up, but the detonator has already gone off.
[00:40:19.161 --> 00:40:21.403]  The chain reaction is already in place.
[00:40:21.863 --> 00:40:27.168]  And now I'm suddenly seeing a major flux, where suddenly
[00:40:28.359 --> 00:40:39.881]  There are thousands of sites and individuals that are really getting the deep knowledge and understanding the paradigm shift, and I feel like I've completed a lot of my mission.
[00:40:39.901 --> 00:40:44.202]  Now, I want to go forward with that, but it's a good feeling.
[00:40:46.663 --> 00:40:48.643]  But it's also very daunting, but enough about that.
[00:40:48.663 --> 00:40:49.884]  I'm just telling you what's on my mind.
[00:40:53.264 --> 00:40:54.044]  It is bracing.
[00:40:55.905 --> 00:40:56.845]  It is chilling.
[00:41:00.128 --> 00:41:02.029]  It's also like a fire in my chest.
[00:41:04.791 --> 00:41:10.155]  But overall, I've had amazing success because I'm real.
[00:41:11.876 --> 00:41:18.781]  And humans can instinctively communicate when they turn on their discernment, when people use it, and folks know I'm real.
[00:41:19.641 --> 00:41:23.484]  That's why the enemy's main drumbeat attack is that I'm not legitimate.
[00:41:24.044 --> 00:41:25.145]  That I'm not real.
[00:41:25.705 --> 00:41:28.848]  Because they're trying to assail the bonafide
[00:41:30.034 --> 00:41:33.316]  Legitimacy, the genuineness of it.
[00:41:34.857 --> 00:41:36.498]  Oh, and I'm genuine warts and all.
[00:41:37.799 --> 00:41:41.061]  I'm genuine in the, uh, boorish appearance.
[00:41:42.622 --> 00:41:43.162]  I'm genuine.
[00:41:44.844 --> 00:41:47.245]  And they can't deal with people that are real.
[00:41:48.706 --> 00:41:50.107]  They can't face it.
[00:41:51.548 --> 00:41:57.572]  And realism is infectious.
[00:41:59.062 --> 00:42:00.703]  And the controllers know that.
[00:42:02.044 --> 00:42:06.426]  We're infecting their minds, or to use a better term, seducing them with the truth.
[00:42:08.147 --> 00:42:15.152]  And when you get so close to darkness, the light, the light, for some, becomes beautiful.
[00:42:15.652 --> 00:42:20.515]  And that unknown quantity, that unknown country, they want to go back to it.
[00:42:21.135 --> 00:42:23.757]  Many of them were born into evil, born into conditioning.
[00:42:24.827 --> 00:42:36.551]  And now as they near the dark flame, they can look back across the chasm, out of purgatory, on their final journey into their own self-made Hades.
[00:42:37.171 --> 00:42:49.075]  And they can see up on the mountaintop the glowing light of heaven, flowing down like living water, and they thirst for it.
[00:42:49.115 --> 00:42:50.075]  Well, come and drink!
[00:42:52.318 --> 00:42:53.799]  You want real knowledge?
[00:42:53.839 --> 00:43:07.931]  You want your mind to be so fulfilled that it burns in a trillion fractal designs of understanding and almost limitless discernment as we, as the little creations of the Great Creator, glimpse the Majesty?
[00:43:11.448 --> 00:43:18.912]  You think the devil can deliver one one trillionth of what the true creator of the universe can deliver to you?
[00:43:19.952 --> 00:43:26.335]  You think you've found power because you're willing to break the laws of God's creation in nature as a cancer?
[00:43:26.695 --> 00:43:29.937]  You think the ability to destroy is power?
[00:43:30.337 --> 00:43:31.298]  It is nothing!
[00:43:31.998 --> 00:43:33.599]  Creation is power!
[00:43:39.707 --> 00:43:41.608]  The darkness runs from the light!
[00:43:41.968 --> 00:43:45.749]  The light is unlimited compared to darkness!
[00:43:47.069 --> 00:43:49.050]  Darkness is the absence of light!
[00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:50.490]  It is the void!
[00:43:50.770 --> 00:43:51.851]  It is the emptiness!
[00:43:51.871 --> 00:43:55.932]  Alright, I'm gonna stop preaching.
[00:44:00.014 --> 00:44:01.716]  Maybe I should take a week off more often.
[00:44:02.256 --> 00:44:04.358]  Every time I leave for a week, I get wound up for months.
[00:44:05.019 --> 00:44:10.464]  World Bank issues its first bonds for the Chinese currency in Hong Kong.
[00:44:11.525 --> 00:44:24.017]  The World Bank is issuing its first bonds, denominated in Chinese Yuan, in Hong Kong, joining a growing number of borrowers
[00:44:25.933 --> 00:44:36.522]  Tapping the new debt market as Beijing gradually promotes of its tightly controlled currency abroad.
[00:44:36.542 --> 00:44:40.306]  That's a weird line.
[00:44:40.886 --> 00:44:44.029]  The World Bank shed buyers of its 500 million yuan, 76 million dollars.
[00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:54.564]  Two-year bond were mainly Hong Kong-based financial institutions, companies, and wealthy individuals.
[00:44:54.824 --> 00:44:59.387]  It said the money will go into its general fund, rather than being raised for a specific purpose.
[00:45:00.168 --> 00:45:06.753]  The Chinese currency is not traded on the global currency markets, but Beijing has loosened controls and allowed Hong Kong banks to use it.
[00:45:07.053 --> 00:45:16.080]  Hong Kong is Chinese territory, but has its own currency and Western-style legal system, and often is used as a site for mainline companies to interact with foreign investors.
[00:45:17.383 --> 00:45:21.768]  Yeah, the British pretty much rule there as the twin-headed eagle with the Chai-coms.
[00:45:22.168 --> 00:45:26.993]  Beijing began allowing foreign companies to issue their currency debt last year.
[00:45:27.273 --> 00:45:29.395]  The Asian Development Bank, Caterpillar Inc.
[00:45:29.636 --> 00:45:35.121]  and McDonald's Group have sold the currency denominated debt to finance activities in China.
[00:45:35.942 --> 00:45:37.623]  So that is a move away.
[00:45:38.003 --> 00:45:38.943]  And you notice U.S.
[00:45:39.003 --> 00:45:40.924]  bonds aren't as valuable now.
[00:45:41.104 --> 00:45:42.785]  U.S.-based companies aren't as valuable.
[00:45:42.805 --> 00:45:44.866]  The premium isn't as valuable.
[00:45:44.926 --> 00:45:46.166]  They're definitely moving away from it.
[00:45:46.727 --> 00:45:47.847]  Here is another one.
[00:45:50.328 --> 00:45:51.909]  World Bank taps offshore
[00:45:53.393 --> 00:45:55.394]  Gone bond market for first time.
[00:45:55.434 --> 00:45:59.697]  So the World Bank is issuing its first Chinese currency-dominated bond.
[00:46:00.277 --> 00:46:02.198]  So they're now accelerating towards it.
[00:46:02.238 --> 00:46:10.743]  The move away, people are kind of getting up, kind of like when a party, you see one first group kind of leaves and people kind of see it, and then they start to leave, and then pretty soon everybody's leaving.
[00:46:11.403 --> 00:46:15.084]  You ever seen blackbirds, or ducks, or seagulls?
[00:46:15.404 --> 00:46:19.205]  There could be 500 out there, you know, eating dead fish or whatever it may be.
[00:46:19.805 --> 00:46:21.966]  And when one takes off, they kind of look and ignore it.
[00:46:21.986 --> 00:46:23.486]  Then two take off, then three, then five.
[00:46:23.706 --> 00:46:24.926]  Then all of a sudden, they all take off.
[00:46:25.726 --> 00:46:27.167]  A couple birds have taken off now.
[00:46:27.227 --> 00:46:28.627]  Four or five just took off now.
[00:46:28.987 --> 00:46:32.288]  The whole group is getting their wings out, getting ready to take off.
[00:46:33.808 --> 00:46:37.249]  The average American's like, NFL games have been really great, haven't they?
[00:46:37.409 --> 00:46:39.850]  You know, guys at gas station counters all asking, you're like,
[00:46:40.717 --> 00:46:43.398]  Yeah, zombie, I wish you could talk about real issues.
[00:46:43.678 --> 00:46:46.839]  And the guy behind you is like, yeah, did you see UFC?
[00:46:46.859 --> 00:46:48.899]  And they're all real concerned.
[00:46:48.939 --> 00:46:57.601]  It's real important to them as men because that's that tribal war area of their mind that should be reserved for political war and defending their position in life.
[00:46:57.921 --> 00:46:59.722]  But instead, it's just kind of little boys.
[00:47:00.022 --> 00:47:02.403]  Yeah, did you see the simulated combat on TV?
[00:47:02.423 --> 00:47:04.123]  Yeah, I watched it.
[00:47:04.603 --> 00:47:07.164]  A bunch of rich gladiators that could care less about me.
[00:47:08.223 --> 00:47:08.964]  Did you see it?
[00:47:09.184 --> 00:47:10.445]  Yeah, I'm empty too.
[00:47:10.785 --> 00:47:11.546]  Yeah, I did.
[00:47:11.566 --> 00:47:16.910]  I fill my head with facts and figures that don't matter, instead of learning the political system and standing up for myself.
[00:47:17.850 --> 00:47:20.552]  Yeah, I wonder why women don't respect me.
[00:47:21.213 --> 00:47:22.954]  I wonder why I'm not successful in business.
[00:47:25.056 --> 00:47:26.637]  Yeah, we're all in the rest of development.
[00:47:26.957 --> 00:47:27.498]  Isn't it fun?
[00:47:27.538 --> 00:47:28.719]  Let's talk about it together.
[00:47:29.319 --> 00:47:31.501]  I mean, if they were having a real discussion, that's what it'd be.
[00:47:31.921 --> 00:47:35.884]  But instead it's like, what you don't want to talk about, they go, oh, you don't know.
[00:47:35.924 --> 00:47:37.546]  And they kind of just look at each other and go,
[00:47:38.530 --> 00:47:46.154]  All the time I'll be at a restaurant or a grocery store or some event and some guys will come over, even people who know who I am, they'll go, hey Alex!
[00:47:46.394 --> 00:47:48.915]  Or I'll be at a soccer game with my kids or whatever.
[00:47:48.935 --> 00:47:54.978]  Again, I'm not saying sports are bad in and of themselves if you're involved in it, but not when it's your whole focus.
[00:47:56.298 --> 00:47:58.519]  And they'll go, hey, what do you think of the Cowboys?
[00:47:58.539 --> 00:48:00.080]  What do you think of this?
[00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:04.542]  And they'll throw out some statistics and I'll just go, I'm not really that interested in it.
[00:48:04.562 --> 00:48:06.183]  And they'll just kind of smile at each other and go,
[00:48:07.782 --> 00:48:21.171]  And then, I mean, I'll sit there and listen to grown men in the gym trying to act like they're sportscasters in these elaborate combinations of information and history and what they're predicting and what they're betting on and what they're doing.
[00:48:21.412 --> 00:48:27.596]  You'll hear even more pathetic discussions of systems to win lotteries and, hey, have you heard the Mega Millions is 200 million?
[00:48:27.916 --> 00:48:29.137]  Hey, are you going to bet on it?
[00:48:29.157 --> 00:48:31.398]  I mean, it's just...
[00:48:32.335 --> 00:48:34.196]  George Orwell in 1984 wrote all about that.
[00:48:34.236 --> 00:48:35.737]  All they cared about was sports and the lottery.
[00:48:36.237 --> 00:48:37.678]  In that fictitious police state.
[00:48:38.298 --> 00:48:38.558]  Look!
[00:48:39.098 --> 00:48:42.740]  We're going to Hades in a giant stinking handbasket.
[00:48:43.901 --> 00:48:44.181]  Okay?
[00:48:44.541 --> 00:48:46.402]  The blood is running out of the country.
[00:48:46.442 --> 00:48:47.743]  We're going ash and white.
[00:48:48.749 --> 00:48:49.729]  We're flatlining.
[00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:56.293]  And I'm sorry if I can't get all upset and paint myself up like a clown and go to a game and get drunk.
[00:48:57.153 --> 00:48:58.794]  I'm sorry I'm not a real man.
[00:48:59.154 --> 00:49:00.215]  I'm sorry.
[00:49:00.235 --> 00:49:01.395]  Okay?
[00:49:01.615 --> 00:49:02.636]  So laugh at me.
[00:49:02.916 --> 00:49:04.597]  There's something wrong with me.
[00:49:04.617 --> 00:49:05.577]  Okay?
[00:49:07.118 --> 00:49:12.360]  I've just predicted everything that was going to unfold and broken down all the government staging terror attacks.
[00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:13.281]  That isn't creepy.
[00:49:15.905 --> 00:49:18.047]  And I warned you about the flu being dangerous.
[00:49:18.087 --> 00:49:20.909]  The flu vaccine, that's now come out and been confirmed.
[00:49:21.389 --> 00:49:23.591]  The government's training for mass arrests in the U.S.
[00:49:23.631 --> 00:49:25.352]  of anyone who criticizes the government.
[00:49:25.672 --> 00:49:27.193]  I agree with you, that's not a problem.
[00:49:27.794 --> 00:49:30.476]  Not when there's global soccer to watch.
[00:49:31.997 --> 00:49:41.164]  And so to all of those guys that really get it and know how to basically put on this fake suit of clothes of who they are,
[00:49:42.534 --> 00:49:43.334]  That's what it is.
[00:49:43.854 --> 00:49:44.695]  It's like who they are.
[00:49:44.935 --> 00:49:57.159]  And they repeat what the news says and what ESPN says and they walk up and you're sitting there at a bar on a trip waiting for your dinner to come and there's guys come up to you drinking beer and it's always the same.
[00:49:57.179 --> 00:49:57.979]  They're like androids.
[00:49:58.319 --> 00:49:59.920]  They have like little fake conversations.
[00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:01.120]  So, what do you think of the playoffs?
[00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:02.221]  What do you think of the weather?
[00:50:02.981 --> 00:50:03.361]  Oh, yeah.
[00:50:03.661 --> 00:50:07.943]  And you start bringing up, I don't know, what do you think of the surveillance grid going in?
[00:50:07.963 --> 00:50:10.964]  Have you heard about how they're listening to all of us without warrants?
[00:50:11.784 --> 00:50:13.665]  They're like, well, gee, buddy, what you bringing that up for?
[00:50:14.006 --> 00:50:14.766]  That's kind of weird.
[00:50:15.227 --> 00:50:16.127]  Well, it is weird they're doing it.
[00:50:16.147 --> 00:50:16.868]  It's very dangerous.
[00:50:16.888 --> 00:50:20.010]  You know what accompanies government spying on people without warrants?
[00:50:20.430 --> 00:50:23.232]  Mass arrests, secret police, torture dungeons.
[00:50:23.472 --> 00:50:24.053]  Well, I don't care.
[00:50:24.073 --> 00:50:24.994]  I'm not involved in politics.
[00:50:25.014 --> 00:50:26.515]  I don't have to worry about that, Mac.
[00:50:26.835 --> 00:50:27.315]  Oh, really?
[00:50:28.256 --> 00:50:32.199]  They're putting the grid in place to rob you, you fat slob!
[00:50:37.583 --> 00:50:41.384]  Oh, well, hey, a black helicopter's going to get me, huh, pal?
[00:50:43.104 --> 00:50:44.665]  Let me move on down the bar here from you.
[00:50:45.045 --> 00:50:45.925]  We got a weirdo here.
[00:50:46.125 --> 00:50:47.526]  He cares about the state of the country.
[00:50:47.786 --> 00:50:49.626]  Boy, the founding fathers wouldn't have liked him.
[00:50:50.646 --> 00:50:52.347]  Oh, they were weirdos, too, though, I guess.
[00:50:52.867 --> 00:50:58.408]  Hey, hey, I'm raising my son to only know about the baseball scores, OK, buddy?
[00:50:59.088 --> 00:51:00.609]  That'll get him ahead in life, all right?
[00:51:01.389 --> 00:51:05.832]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:51:59.185 --> 00:52:03.090]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:52:03.150 --> 00:52:05.333]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:52:05.353 --> 00:52:08.256]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:08.677 --> 00:52:13.422]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:13.783 --> 00:52:17.988]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:18.288 --> 00:52:20.631]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:20.651 --> 00:52:23.154]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:23.174 --> 00:52:26.097]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:26.437 --> 00:52:34.046]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:34.372 --> 00:52:39.633]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:39.753 --> 00:52:42.554]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:42.614 --> 00:52:46.035]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:46.295 --> 00:52:47.215]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:47.375 --> 00:52:48.675]  You're everyone else.

[00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:58.801]  Dr. Nick Begich is joining us at the Eight After.
[00:53:58.821 --> 00:54:07.966]  I want to continue with the news here.
[00:54:16.325 --> 00:54:26.010]  The pace of moving away from the dollar worldwide is gaining a lot of speed right now, and they're moving towards the Chinese currency as an interim balance to that.
[00:54:27.059 --> 00:54:27.259]  We're good
[00:54:48.089 --> 00:54:51.730]  So the bottom line here is the economy is not in very good shape.
[00:54:52.210 --> 00:54:54.710]  Continuing commodities outlook for 2011.
[00:54:55.671 --> 00:54:58.971]  Oil above 100 and gold 1,500.
[00:54:59.731 --> 00:55:07.113]  CNN has interviewed a spectrum of commodities experts and the lion's share of them believe that gold is going to go above $1,500 an ounce.
[00:55:07.573 --> 00:55:08.853]  I think that's very conservative.
[00:55:09.333 --> 00:55:12.294]  As you notice, they can drive it down with paper manipulation for a few days.
[00:55:13.314 --> 00:55:15.757]  Or even a few weeks, but it always goes right back up.
[00:55:16.057 --> 00:55:18.320]  The 10-year graph is going hyperbolic.
[00:55:20.012 --> 00:55:31.038]  On average, investment strategies and money managers are predicting oil prices will rise 4% and gold will edge up 1% by the end of 2011, according to an exclusive CNN Money survey.
[00:55:31.398 --> 00:55:37.381]  Commodity prices had a stellar 2010, and experts expect that momentum to carry over to the next year.
[00:55:37.961 --> 00:55:47.906]  And of course, they don't tell you until deeper in here that it's dollar devaluation, and they say that the recovery is endangered by increased commodity prices.
[00:55:48.546 --> 00:55:49.127]  The recovery.
[00:55:49.992 --> 00:55:50.732]  This is a recovery.
[00:55:50.792 --> 00:55:53.013]  I certainly don't want to see a recession or depression.
[00:55:54.313 --> 00:55:54.793]  Here's another one.
[00:55:54.853 --> 00:55:57.994]  World food prices rise to record on sugar meat cost.
[00:55:59.395 --> 00:56:00.455]  That's out of Bloomberg.
[00:56:01.135 --> 00:56:08.877]  World food prices, we told you this a few years ago what happened, to a record in December on higher sugar grain and oil seed cost.
[00:56:08.917 --> 00:56:14.899]  The United Nations said exceeding levels reached in 08 that sparked deadly riots from Haiti to Egypt.
[00:56:15.439 --> 00:56:27.469]  An index of 55 food commodities tracked by the Food and Agriculture Organization gained for a sixth month 214.7 points above the previous all-time high of 213.5 in June of 2008.
[00:56:27.970 --> 00:56:30.512]  Again, that's global dollar devaluation causing that.
[00:56:30.552 --> 00:56:33.114]  That's the main contributor.
[00:56:33.914 --> 00:56:37.197]  But have you noticed since they got rid of Glass-Steagall in the U.S.
[00:56:37.237 --> 00:56:39.879]  and similar laws worldwide to create all this counterfeit?
[00:56:40.768 --> 00:56:41.389]  I don't think so.
[00:56:52.540 --> 00:56:54.362]  But they also know there's going to be civil unrest.
[00:56:54.382 --> 00:56:56.704]  That's why the British Ministry of Defense four years ago.
[00:56:57.204 --> 00:56:59.406]  That's why the Department of Defense the last two years.
[00:57:00.007 --> 00:57:01.808]  All they've been doing is gearing up for this.
[00:57:02.349 --> 00:57:06.012]  And now, this year, and late last year, they make the announcements.
[00:57:06.613 --> 00:57:09.956]  Oh, gee, we just discovered there's going to be financial unrest.
[00:57:10.216 --> 00:57:12.438]  Good thing we set up this police state for the Muslims.
[00:57:12.678 --> 00:57:13.739]  It's really for all of you.
[00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:15.081]  Jeepers!
[00:57:15.421 --> 00:57:16.802]  We're sure lucky we set it up.
[00:57:16.822 --> 00:57:17.363]  Oopsie!
[00:57:17.423 --> 00:57:20.727]  Oh, we put local federal spy grids in everywhere in every country.
[00:57:20.747 --> 00:57:22.929]  Oh, we built lots of new prisons.
[00:57:23.770 --> 00:57:24.410]  Oh boy!
[00:57:25.391 --> 00:57:27.013]  Lucky we're surveilling everyone.
[00:57:27.494 --> 00:57:30.717]  We did it for Al-Qaeda, but now we're going to use it on you.
[00:57:30.737 --> 00:57:36.043]  Good thing we started building this in acceleration 11 years ago when we set it all up.
[00:57:38.592 --> 00:57:42.114]  Just total premeditated continuity of agenda worldwide.
[00:57:42.214 --> 00:57:45.075]  Same program, same uniforms, same everything.
[00:57:45.115 --> 00:57:49.697]  Just global financial takeover with a military takeover on the tail end of it.
[00:57:50.117 --> 00:57:51.218]  As the solution!
[00:57:51.898 --> 00:57:55.980]  I mean, you want something to be done about all the rioting, the starving.
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:59.022]  I mean, don't you want us to help you?
[00:58:00.379 --> 00:58:06.100]  All the animals and birds and things dying, and the bees dying, and pollination down by almost half in the West?
[00:58:06.921 --> 00:58:09.701]  Oh, we're not going to ban the pesticides that do it, or the GMO.
[00:58:10.242 --> 00:58:14.082]  No, we're going to federally inspect your house and raise all your taxes.
[00:58:15.563 --> 00:58:16.763]  No, we're the government.
[00:58:17.183 --> 00:58:19.164]  Rising oil prices threaten fragile recovery.
[00:58:19.184 --> 00:58:20.244]  Financial Times of London.
[00:58:20.524 --> 00:58:22.445]  Oils continue steady climb.
[00:58:22.765 --> 00:58:25.085]  Here's the key article out of CNBC.
[00:58:25.945 --> 00:58:27.566]  Economic recovery not strong enough.
[00:58:28.854 --> 00:58:30.555]  To alter stimulus, Fed says.
[00:58:31.196 --> 00:58:34.318]  Oh, they've got to keep QE2 and QE3 giving themselves trillions.
[00:58:34.739 --> 00:58:36.580]  They've got to continue that to help you.
[00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:39.823]  Of course, you've got to pay it all back in taxes and you don't get any of the money.
[00:58:40.643 --> 00:58:45.627]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[00:58:46.648 --> 00:58:49.510]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[00:58:50.111 --> 00:58:50.471]  A very
[00:58:51.530 --> 00:59:05.997]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:59:06.998 --> 00:59:10.680]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.

[00:59:24.462 --> 00:59:31.728]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.

[01:00:11.799 --> 01:00:12.720]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.341 --> 01:00:16.964]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.544 --> 01:00:21.608]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.214 --> 01:00:31.497]  So, going through the economic news, I had a better Nick Beggins joining us.
[01:00:31.597 --> 01:00:36.661]  Economic recovery not strong enough to alter stimulus, the Federal Reserve says.
[01:00:37.502 --> 01:00:43.367]  I sleep a lot better knowing the Fed that engineered all this publicly and that it's private and won't tell Congress where the trillions went.
[01:00:43.868 --> 01:00:45.929]  I sleep good knowing they run everything secretly.
[01:00:46.750 --> 01:00:47.111]  Don't you?
[01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:52.322]  And keep telling us that if we just give them more power and unlimited money, they'll fix it all.
[01:00:53.822 --> 01:00:55.143]  Though they want a depression.
[01:00:56.703 --> 01:01:13.130]  Federal Reserve officials, uh, officials, not private corporate criminals, officials, authorities, financial veterans, Federal Reserve officials, oh, they're officials, uh, stuck with the pace of their 60 billion.
[01:01:15.523 --> 01:01:26.169]  Treasury bond buying program last month becoming the trillions because the economy wasn't improving fast enough to make a noticeable dent in unemployment.
[01:01:27.229 --> 01:01:29.070]  Minutes of the December meeting show.
[01:01:31.051 --> 01:01:34.453]  And that's their little public quasi-public meeting where they give us a bunch of baloney.
[01:01:34.893 --> 01:01:37.355]  Spending by consumers and businesses.
[01:01:38.479 --> 01:01:41.442]  has improved heading into the final month of 2010.
[01:01:43.363 --> 01:01:50.089]  And Congress was on the verge of enacting a tax cut package that would bolster the economy, Fed officials said.
[01:01:50.529 --> 01:01:56.614]  That made them more confident the economic recovery would gain momentum, according to the minutes of the Fed's closed-door meeting December 14th.
[01:01:57.035 --> 01:01:58.576]  Then they go back into the double-talk.
[01:01:59.377 --> 01:02:06.603]  Risks still loomed, the minutes said, particularly a weak housing market and spending cuts and layoffs from state and local governments.
[01:02:10.275 --> 01:02:17.441]  And then Curt Nemo has an article boiling down why we see the oil going up so much.
[01:02:17.621 --> 01:02:30.391]  On December 16th, Lindsey Williams told Alex Jones the price of crude oil would soon hit $150 to $200 per barrel, and this would translate into gas prices in the range
[01:02:31.778 --> 01:02:33.860]  Uh... four to five dollars per gallon.
[01:02:34.221 --> 01:02:44.051]  Williams, an ordained Baptist minister who went to Alaska in 1971 as a missionary, was told about the price increases by insiders in the oil industry.
[01:02:45.851 --> 01:02:49.153]  He had befriended, and he went through all of his predictions.
[01:02:49.374 --> 01:02:53.116]  And since then, crude oil has gone up more than $10.
[01:02:53.337 --> 01:02:59.641]  And now we've seen head executives at Shell and other places say, oh yeah, $150, $200 a barrel by 2012.
[01:02:59.681 --> 01:03:00.222]  $5 plus at the gas pump.
[01:03:09.238 --> 01:03:17.061]  And there's a really disgusting article, I mean the facts in it are disgusting, by the Economic Collapse blog up on Infowars.com.
[01:03:18.001 --> 01:03:19.201]  Everything is falling apart.
[01:03:19.522 --> 01:03:24.943]  20 facts that you will not want to read if you still want to feel good about America's decaying infrastructure.
[01:03:25.944 --> 01:03:32.446]  And we're not trying to be negative here, we're being honest about what's happening so we can stop the policies that have engineered this.
[01:03:32.486 --> 01:03:34.947]  Number one, one-third of America's major roads
[01:03:36.423 --> 01:03:38.244]  are in poor or mediocre condition.
[01:03:38.664 --> 01:03:51.610]  Number two, traffic on more than half the miles of interstate highways sees 70% of capacity and nearly 25% of the miles are strained at more than 95% of capacity.
[01:03:51.670 --> 01:04:03.536]  Number three, Americans waste 4.2 billion hours and 2.8 billion gallons of fuel a year sitting in traffic equally to nearly one full work week and three weeks worth of gas for every traveler.
[01:04:03.856 --> 01:04:04.316]  Number four,
[01:04:04.796 --> 01:04:15.825]  Over the next 30 years, our nation is expected to grow by 100 million, and highway traffic will double again, even if the highway capacity grows no faster.
[01:04:15.845 --> 01:04:22.550]  In the next 25 years, Americans can expect to spend 160 hours or four work weeks each year in traffic by 2035.
[01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:31.557]  Number five, nearly a third of all highway fatalities are due to be substandard road conditions, obsolete road...
[01:04:32.518 --> 01:04:45.226]  Designs and roadside hazards number six over 4,000 95 dams are unsafe and have deficiencies that leave them more susceptible to failure especially during Large flood events and earthquakes.
[01:04:45.506 --> 01:04:53.251]  Well, that's only six points out of the 20 You know in Europe the trains go over 200 miles an hour in Japan close to 300 same thing in China
[01:04:54.306 --> 01:04:56.127]  Our trains can hardly go 50 miles an hour.
[01:04:56.507 --> 01:04:59.908]  A hundred years ago they were going over a hundred because they've got ancient railways.
[01:04:59.928 --> 01:05:00.708]  They don't fix anything.
[01:05:00.728 --> 01:05:04.549]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:05:04.790 --> 01:05:10.832]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:05:11.192 --> 01:05:15.093]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me
[01:05:15.293 --> 01:05:18.294]  How much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:05:18.574 --> 01:05:23.156]  There is nothing like these factory direct, big money saving, triple concentrated soaps anywhere.

[01:05:32.119 --> 01:05:35.840]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[01:05:36.380 --> 01:05:42.546]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:05:43.146 --> 01:05:46.570]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:05:47.050 --> 01:05:54.357]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[01:05:54.477 --> 01:05:54.937]  Thank you.
[01:06:00.402 --> 01:06:01.543]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:06:01.583 --> 01:06:08.245]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:06:08.505 --> 01:06:10.786]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:06:11.067 --> 01:06:16.269]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:06:16.449 --> 01:06:19.210]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:06:19.490 --> 01:06:21.611]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:06:21.791 --> 01:06:27.734]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:06:28.054 --> 01:06:28.494]  In fact,
[01:06:28.814 --> 01:06:29.414]  We're good to go.
[01:06:58.126 --> 01:06:59.807]  That's endofamerica3.com.
[01:07:00.687 --> 01:07:03.308]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:07:03.708 --> 01:07:08.671]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:07:09.031 --> 01:07:10.752]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:07:11.092 --> 01:07:15.894]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:07:16.074 --> 01:07:17.054]  How much do you want?
[01:07:17.274 --> 01:07:18.015]  When do you want it?
[01:07:18.395 --> 01:07:19.996]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:07:20.276 --> 01:07:21.096]  When will you need it?
[01:07:21.356 --> 01:07:23.417]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:07:23.557 --> 01:07:24.658]  Will there be any food?
[01:07:24.898 --> 01:07:25.418]  Will it make your
[01:07:25.418 --> 01:07:31.481]  If your children's sick, if there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:07:31.681 --> 01:07:34.863]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:07:35.263 --> 01:07:38.765]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:07:39.085 --> 01:07:40.066]  How much will you need?
[01:07:40.306 --> 01:07:40.906]  We don't know.
[01:07:41.207 --> 01:07:42.127]  How much do you want?
[01:07:42.327 --> 01:07:43.048]  All you can get.
[01:07:43.248 --> 01:07:43.928]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:07:44.328 --> 01:07:47.091]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:07:47.391 --> 01:07:48.512]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[01:07:49.493 --> 01:07:54.657]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:07:54.917 --> 01:07:57.580]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[01:07:57.740 --> 01:08:08.229]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.829 --> 01:08:11.812]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:23.137 --> 01:08:26.638]  We're live, eight minutes into the second hour of worldwide broadcast.
[01:08:27.798 --> 01:08:33.340]  Dr. Nick Begich, eldest son of late United States Congressman from Alaska, Nick Begich Sr.
[01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:36.140]  His brother is the U.S.
[01:08:36.180 --> 01:08:40.402]  Senator from Alaska, and he's a best-selling author.
[01:08:40.462 --> 01:08:42.362]  The website is earthpulse.com.
[01:08:43.142 --> 01:08:44.763]  He heads up the
[01:08:46.348 --> 01:08:46.949]  Lay Group.
[01:09:01.528 --> 01:09:09.730]  We're going to get into Tesla technologies with him, which now, again, more and more mainstream news is admitting is much more advanced than we even know.
[01:09:09.850 --> 01:09:12.811]  The FBI confiscated the documents and has suppressed much of it.
[01:09:13.231 --> 01:09:19.432]  I want to get into the bees dying, the bumblebees, four species of those, more than half of them gone.
[01:09:20.273 --> 01:09:23.433]  All sorts of bizarre bird die-offs that are going on.
[01:09:23.453 --> 01:09:25.714]  The government says it isn't pesticides.
[01:09:26.496 --> 01:09:33.522]  though there is a pesticide sprayed generally in December and January that is restricted in use that only kills blackbirds.
[01:09:33.582 --> 01:09:36.125]  Jaren's in there researching it right now.
[01:09:36.865 --> 01:09:46.454]  All these big fish die-offs, the increase in volcanic activity here in the United States, we're going to discuss it all with Dr. Nick Begich, plus that Daily Mail article
[01:09:47.475 --> 01:09:49.015]  You guys pulled that out of the stack the other day.
[01:09:49.055 --> 01:09:49.936]  We printed it in color.
[01:09:50.896 --> 01:10:00.378]  Admitting that they're putting up HAARP-type technology in Middle Eastern nations, causing rainstorms, which is what Dr. Begich and others have gone over the patents and shown.
[01:10:00.938 --> 01:10:02.538]  HAARP and other systems are a big part of.
[01:10:02.938 --> 01:10:05.619]  So, this has always been in the scientific literature.
[01:10:05.639 --> 01:10:11.420]  If you know where to look, weather modification, known as chemtrailing, the geoengineering
[01:10:12.642 --> 01:10:18.129]  But what has changed is the internet has forced all this out in the open, so the mainstream corporate media is playing catch-up.
[01:10:18.710 --> 01:10:20.332]  Dr. Nick Maggott, it's great to have you here with us.
[01:10:20.572 --> 01:10:26.359]  Well, thanks for having me again, Alex, and it's always good to be with you, especially on these topics these days.
[01:10:26.539 --> 01:10:27.821]  It's a pretty important issue.
[01:10:28.237 --> 01:10:29.137]  You know, it's funny.
[01:10:30.578 --> 01:10:44.803]  We called you Monday, and I'd already told Jaren I wanted to get you on the show to talk about the birds and the news reporting on electromagnetic weather modification systems, farms they're putting in all over the world.
[01:10:45.583 --> 01:10:49.005]  Most of them, of course, are covert, but the Arabs are admitting they've got them.
[01:10:49.505 --> 01:10:55.027]  And then, right after that happened, I guess great minds think alike, Coast to Coast AM called and got you and I on together.
[01:10:55.047 --> 01:10:57.788]  That was certainly an informative and fast-paced hour.
[01:10:58.410 --> 01:10:59.890]  Yeah, that was great.
[01:11:00.131 --> 01:11:17.576]  It's been a long time since we've been together on radio, and it's always great to be on with folks that stay informed on this stuff, because as you know, so many people are just unaware, and it is a little bit technical, but these are the things of the 21st century and things that all of us can weigh in on.
[01:11:19.636 --> 01:11:20.697]  Well, it certainly is.
[01:11:20.777 --> 01:11:22.478]  What do you want to tackle first?
[01:11:22.798 --> 01:11:26.400]  You want to get into the weather modification and the Tesla technologies?
[01:11:26.420 --> 01:11:37.527]  Or do you want to get into the leaked document, EPA knowingly approved bee-killing pesticide, mass bird and fish die-offs go global, spark end times panic?
[01:11:38.607 --> 01:11:48.173]  Let's jump into the weather modification going on in the Middle East right now, because that, I think, is perhaps one of the big drivers for a lot of these things that we're starting to see.
[01:11:49.023 --> 01:11:54.869]  The idea that we can modify weather utilizing technologies has been around a long time.
[01:11:54.909 --> 01:12:03.739]  People remember the stories of cloud seeding and using various chemicals and compounds to try and suck a little moisture out of the atmosphere.
[01:12:04.528 --> 01:12:13.391]  But really, some big changes happened and the understanding of how energy interacts with weather systems became interesting for many researchers.
[01:12:13.431 --> 01:12:21.893]  Electrostatics, the stuff of the article in the Middle East, being able to create and stimulate rainfall, that's been around quite a while.
[01:12:21.953 --> 01:12:31.977]  In fact, if you go back to a number of years ago, back in the 90s, there were some very large fires in Indonesia blowing smoke into Malaysia.
[01:12:32.037 --> 01:12:32.837]  Many will remember
[01:12:33.817 --> 01:12:35.557]  That situation is pretty horrendous.
[01:12:36.158 --> 01:12:40.258]  But at that time, missed by most, but the mainstream did pick it up.
[01:12:40.298 --> 01:12:50.760]  There was an article about a Russian company offering electrostatics, basically saying, hey, we can steer the hurricane, we can create an artificial hurricane and blow the smoke right out of the way.
[01:12:51.860 --> 01:13:01.242]  During the Olympics, it came up both in Russia and China at various times that weather modification was one way to keep the Olympics free of bad weather.
[01:13:02.137 --> 01:13:11.247]  All of this, while all of this is going on and gaining great currency in terms of science, there's been no sort of regulation of it.
[01:13:11.267 --> 01:13:17.494]  You know, when you look at the planet, you can't alter weather in one place and just expect that everything sort of stays in that neighborhood.
[01:13:18.234 --> 01:13:19.256]  That isn't how it works.
[01:13:19.736 --> 01:13:21.378]  Whatever we do in one place has
[01:13:22.133 --> 01:13:27.158]  Profound and usually unexpected results elsewhere.
[01:13:27.218 --> 01:13:30.521]  That's where some pretty significant risks come in.
[01:13:30.581 --> 01:13:36.967]  The other place, going back to some of the work that Bernard Eastman was doing when he invented HAARP,
[01:13:38.591 --> 01:13:45.774]  That whole system was predicated on huge, huge amounts of energy being available for manipulating weather formations.
[01:13:45.994 --> 01:14:00.399]  And what Eastland discovered in 2004-2005, a couple years before he died, was the idea that HAARP could manipulate what are called gravitational waves, which he believed were the root of weather systems, using energy 1,600
[01:14:03.004 --> 01:14:04.925]  of the energy he originally thought was needed.
[01:14:04.945 --> 01:14:17.492]  In other words, just a small, small fraction of energy was needed to manipulate gravitational waves that then would have this cascading reaction through geophysical systems, including weather systems.
[01:14:17.632 --> 01:14:23.695]  And that research he actually presented when I was working as Executive Director of the LA Institute.
[01:14:23.735 --> 01:14:29.999]  We had Dr. Eastland in Dallas for a conference on mind effects, and one of the things that
[01:14:30.752 --> 01:14:36.593]  Uh, he talked about, of course, which HAARP and some of its applications, particularly in this area of weather modification.
[01:14:37.514 --> 01:14:46.316]  From your deep research, I know you've gone through that HAARP is multifaceted, over-the-horizon radar-type systems, weather modification.
[01:14:46.816 --> 01:14:51.397]  I mean, really, it's an array of things, but when you talk about gravitational waves,
[01:14:52.412 --> 01:15:05.477]  It's interesting, Fox News and others are pointing out that meteorologist, climatologist, appears Corbin, who we've had on before, stunningly can predict the weather.
[01:15:06.590 --> 01:15:29.680]  with many times more accuracy than these big so-called computer models because he focuses on gravitational waves and he goes back to the multi hundred-year-old science where the old timers didn't know why but it was connected to the moon changing and they didn't know what the action was then they just knew that when the moon was in certain cycles it was doing certain things now they know that it's the moon
[01:15:30.740 --> 01:15:42.251]  Causing different gravitational events but also shielding the earth or exposing the earth more to the solar winds of different ionizing particles.
[01:15:42.271 --> 01:15:51.139]  So there's a lot of things within the earth without the earth that are driving whether the science shows more than what mainline
[01:15:52.300 --> 01:16:01.046]  Global warming type kook scientists say, and they know this too, they just want to ignore it and claim that humans exhaling carbon dioxide is causing it.
[01:16:01.086 --> 01:16:03.508]  So A, what is HAARP really?
[01:16:04.368 --> 01:16:08.911]  B, I've seen the reports that there are really HAARP centers all over the world, they just call them other things.
[01:16:09.351 --> 01:16:12.974]  And then C, could this be connected to the increase in earthquakes?
[01:16:13.861 --> 01:16:14.421]  It could be.
[01:16:14.762 --> 01:16:16.643]  Let's go for the first thing.
[01:16:16.903 --> 01:16:22.906]  There are many facilities that have phased arrays, radio frequency transmitters designed like HARP.
[01:16:22.946 --> 01:16:31.611]  HARP is the acronym for this specific project, but these arrays exist in several locations around the world, including the former Soviet Union, Canada, throughout Europe.
[01:16:32.031 --> 01:16:34.353]  The Chinese even have one in Antarctica.
[01:16:34.993 --> 01:16:37.836]  So, you know, it's pretty widespread in terms of that.
[01:16:38.036 --> 01:16:54.790]  The technology, what HAARP is designed for, is manipulating the ionosphere, changing this layer above the Earth's surface that is so responsible in large part for the quality and character of communications, for the fact that we have biological life even on this planet.
[01:16:56.045 --> 01:17:06.328]  Using energy essentially as the base of this system to alter the geophysics of the planet, the things that actually make the planet run and work.
[01:17:06.428 --> 01:17:18.991]  So think about it as sort of a man-made component shoved on the machine of Earth to change its character in certain respects and the way it works using energy itself.
[01:17:19.351 --> 01:17:20.471]  And so when you think about
[01:17:21.051 --> 01:17:25.814]  For the direction in which this science has taken us, it's not just about HAARP.
[01:17:26.014 --> 01:17:29.316]  It's this whole revolution of military affairs.
[01:17:29.356 --> 01:17:31.777]  I know you've talked to your audience about this before.
[01:17:31.837 --> 01:17:40.702]  This RMA includes a whole class of weapons and technologies of which HAARP is really just a very small part.
[01:17:40.763 --> 01:17:46.486]  It's just the one part that happens to have gotten a good bit of notoriety because we sort of attacked that as
[01:17:47.293 --> 01:18:02.812]  You know, one very fine example of where this technology is going, and more importantly, it is the largest radio transmitter of its kind ever designed and built in the world, and it presents huge challenges, particularly in the areas we're talking about today.
[01:18:04.798 --> 01:18:19.104]  And of course when we talk about this only being one component, we look at things like the Hadron Superconducting Super Collider, and just like 10-15 years ago they'd make fun of us if we even said HAARP existed, now it's common knowledge.
[01:18:19.124 --> 01:18:21.666]  I read what the directors of
[01:18:22.797 --> 01:18:23.378]  I don't
[01:18:42.831 --> 01:18:50.694]  High-powered hydrogen bombs in the upper atmosphere, and they thought there was a good chance it might actually destroy the atmosphere, but they still did it.
[01:18:50.934 --> 01:19:04.659]  So when I see statements like that, I mean, I know there's no way to quantify it, but just from a layman, this looks like this could really damage the planet or even destroy our civilization.
[01:19:04.819 --> 01:19:04.999]  Right.
[01:19:05.495 --> 01:19:13.484]  Well, you know, this is again where science kind of moves on and sort of forgets the rest of us in the background as if we didn't exist.
[01:19:13.504 --> 01:19:20.912]  A lot of scientists are very incensed when lay people, the average person, starts to weigh in on their issues.
[01:19:20.932 --> 01:19:25.858]  They feel like it's sort of their exclusive domain and no one else is qualified.
[01:19:25.918 --> 01:19:26.659]  The reality is
[01:19:27.358 --> 01:19:31.781]  When you talk about effects of technologies, we're all qualified to weigh in.
[01:19:31.821 --> 01:19:35.804]  We may not be the engineers or designers, but that should not matter.
[01:19:36.005 --> 01:19:42.329]  And in this century, what we're doing with this technology is either going to make us free or make us slaves.
[01:19:43.550 --> 01:19:45.772]  And we all should have a debate and have input on that.
[01:19:45.832 --> 01:19:46.152]  Stay there.
[01:19:46.172 --> 01:19:47.153]  Let's get into Hadron.
[01:19:47.413 --> 01:19:50.956]  Let's get into other advanced technologies that you're concerned about.
[01:19:50.976 --> 01:19:55.499]  I also want to ask the question, why are so many of these HAARP programs, the Chinese and others,
[01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:57.661]  Why are they near the polls?
[01:19:57.841 --> 01:19:58.922]  What's important about that?
[01:20:00.984 --> 01:20:04.266]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[01:20:05.067 --> 01:20:09.310]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[01:20:09.570 --> 01:20:15.514]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[01:20:15.735 --> 01:20:17.876]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[01:20:18.176 --> 01:20:24.141]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[01:20:24.241 --> 01:20:27.583]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[01:20:27.663 --> 01:20:29.364]  There is no other program of its kind.
[01:20:29.524 --> 01:20:31.585]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[01:20:31.705 --> 01:20:36.387]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.
[01:20:36.587 --> 01:20:37.208]  Guaranteed.
[01:20:37.408 --> 01:20:41.450]  Prevent wage garnishments, bank levies, and stop collection calls with our proven program.
[01:20:41.690 --> 01:20:46.572]  Call Zero Debt in 90 days now, 800-477-9256, and ask for free information from an expert who also completed our program.
[01:20:46.592 --> 01:20:47.652]  800-477-9256 or ZeroDebtGuarantee.com.
[01:20:47.672 --> 01:20:48.373]  800-477-9256 or ZeroDebtGuarantee.com.
[01:21:00.262 --> 01:21:00.702]  Gold.
[01:21:01.043 --> 01:21:02.323]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:21:02.583 --> 01:21:08.687]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:21:08.847 --> 01:21:12.690]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:21:13.030 --> 01:21:14.931]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:21:14.971 --> 01:21:17.252]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:21:17.412 --> 01:21:24.957]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[01:21:24.957 --> 01:21:25.137]  Okay.

[01:23:00.303 --> 01:23:04.605]  Fight back this cold and flu season with the world's best garlic extract, Ali-C.
[01:23:04.785 --> 01:23:05.565]  Why Ali-C?
[01:23:05.625 --> 01:23:09.007]  Because it helps your body fight viruses, bacteria, and fungi.
[01:23:09.207 --> 01:23:16.870]  Ali-C has been scientifically proven in double-blind studies using low doses to greatly reduce the number, severity, and duration of common colds.
[01:23:17.250 --> 01:23:22.634]  Ali-C contains 300 milligrams of stabilized allicin, the active ingredient in crushed garlic.
[01:23:22.814 --> 01:23:27.478]  Studies show Ali-C is effective against MRSA, bacterial, fungal, and viral infections.
[01:23:28.038 --> 01:23:31.381]  One tablet of Ali-C has the equivalent of 40 cloves of garlic.
[01:23:31.741 --> 01:23:37.866]  Ali-C supports your body's resistance to all types of conditions and can help lower high blood pressure and high cholesterol.
[01:23:38.186 --> 01:23:42.809]  So boost your body's resistance to infection with nature's best garlic extract, Ali-C.

[01:24:04.412 --> 01:24:13.418]  Dr. Begich doesn't put on airs, but he's been an expert to the European Union Parliament.
[01:24:32.079 --> 01:24:38.535]  He, of course, has been the president of both the Alaskan Federation of Teachers and the Anchorage City Council of Education.
[01:24:40.436 --> 01:24:42.957]  I can get into his doctorate all day.
[01:24:43.497 --> 01:24:44.658]  His brother is a U.S.
[01:24:44.698 --> 01:24:45.018]  Senator.
[01:24:45.078 --> 01:24:48.920]  His father was Nick Baggett Sr.
[01:24:48.940 --> 01:25:06.247]  This is a short segment, a long segment coming up, but Doc, getting back into this, what are your concerns overall with something like the Hadron Superconducting Super Collider, and are there other technologies and other scientific operations that you're more concerned about?
[01:25:06.837 --> 01:25:16.410]  Well, the risks associated with big science, you know, they even identified, I mean, the idea of creating a catastrophic event with this type of technology.
[01:25:17.433 --> 01:25:25.762]  Again, this is why we need a little closer scrutiny, and I am actually more concerned about the things that we don't see.
[01:25:25.802 --> 01:25:33.550]  I mean, what we see in the open literature is certainly hair-raising in some cases, and pretty disturbing in others.
[01:25:33.811 --> 01:25:38.756]  But what we do know is that the direction in which the technologies have moved
[01:25:39.438 --> 01:25:51.846]  It's really more about how do you affect biological systems like human beings and other systems in a way where you can literally manipulate the players.
[01:25:51.866 --> 01:26:01.893]  I mean, when you think about military interventions, you know, and we're looking at it right now, you look at our budget on rebuild on countries after we go in and annihilate them.
[01:26:02.641 --> 01:26:03.322]  I think so.
[01:26:23.115 --> 01:26:31.759]  Uh, the human being in this way, it is much, much different than bombs and bullets, and starts to raise, uh, the bigger kinds of questions of, you know, what's rational?
[01:26:31.819 --> 01:26:43.904]  And we've said biological and chemical weapons are immoral, and yet weapons that affect, um, in a much more profound way than chemicals, um, aren't even restricted at all.
[01:26:44.185 --> 01:26:51.608]  And this, I think, is critically important, is the reactions of chemicals or chemical constituents that were so appalling in World War I,
[01:26:56.592 --> 01:27:18.790]  And to simplify it, you're talking about mind control, and I've seen the patents that you've covered, I've looked at them at the patent office, I've seen articles in the Baltimore Sun where it goes, oh, DARPA's looking at putting up towers to calm you during emergencies.
[01:27:19.551 --> 01:27:19.711]  Yeah.
[01:27:37.742 --> 01:27:41.646]  For whatever bit of technology we see, there's an iceberg beneath that.
[01:27:42.327 --> 01:27:44.649]  How much of this stuff do we even know about, Doc?
[01:27:44.769 --> 01:27:46.150]  Very little, actually.
[01:27:46.511 --> 01:27:51.696]  What you see in the open literature is just a fragment, a grain of sand on the beach of knowledge, if you will.
[01:27:51.956 --> 01:27:54.678]  There's just so much more out there.
[01:27:54.799 --> 01:28:00.164]  When you look at any of the areas that we've covered, from mind effects to weather effects,
[01:28:00.808 --> 01:28:06.991]  You know, we've been covering them now over 15 years, and consistently, and this is the true test in my opinion.
[01:28:07.011 --> 01:28:12.414]  You go back to our original writings in 1994, and nothing has changed.
[01:28:13.114 --> 01:28:20.378]  You can look through those articles, those books, the materials we've produced, and we have not changed our opinion one iota.
[01:28:20.438 --> 01:28:28.282]  The facts that we identified then, and the sources that we referenced are primarily government, military, and mainstream documents that were unclassified.
[01:28:29.093 --> 01:28:32.675]  Nothing has happened to change our opinions, only to prove that we were correct.
[01:28:32.995 --> 01:28:35.137]  And you've experienced the same thing in a lot of your work.
[01:28:36.177 --> 01:28:43.702]  And the mainstream does eventually catch up, but usually it's sort of when the train has left the station and is already arriving somewhere else.
[01:28:44.803 --> 01:28:46.604]  That's where we are on this technology.
[01:28:46.644 --> 01:28:47.044]  And again,
[01:28:47.850 --> 01:28:57.034]  You know, the idea of affecting weather systems, of affecting other forms of living organisms, including, you know, the latest thing with the birds.
[01:28:57.054 --> 01:29:01.975]  You know, now we hear another situation in Louisiana, very similar to what was in Arkansas.
[01:29:02.035 --> 01:29:02.356]  Europe?
[01:29:03.076 --> 01:29:03.296]  Yep.
[01:29:03.576 --> 01:29:09.738]  And so, there was a very interesting study, and this gets back to, you know, people want to blame the chemistry.
[01:29:09.938 --> 01:29:15.821]  And I was in a conference in Brussels, it was a closed conference for a group called GLOBE, which is 44 governments,
[01:29:17.273 --> 01:29:17.994]  Uh, legislators.
[01:29:18.094 --> 01:29:21.878]  And in their 12th General Assembly in 1997, I attended.
[01:29:22.558 --> 01:29:31.166]  And the people that we were lecturing with on the other side was a group that had just written a book on chemicals creating false hormones in the environment.
[01:29:31.707 --> 01:29:36.271]  And I was talking with the guys from MIT and from Washington that were responsible for that.
[01:29:36.771 --> 01:29:41.015]  And the overlay is energy itself, because it triggers
[01:29:41.736 --> 01:29:42.938]  Very bizarre chemical reaction.
[01:29:42.998 --> 01:29:43.378]  That's right.
[01:29:43.418 --> 01:29:48.105]  Instead of putting chemicals in you, they can use harmonics or waves to make you produce it yourself.
[01:29:48.145 --> 01:29:48.726]  Stay there, Doctor.
[01:29:48.746 --> 01:29:49.306]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:50.929 --> 01:29:51.850]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.330 --> 01:29:53.933]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.854 --> 01:29:57.557]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.903 --> 01:30:05.546]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:30:05.926 --> 01:30:08.949]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:30:09.169 --> 01:30:13.953]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:30:13.973 --> 01:30:20.198]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:30:20.358 --> 01:30:22.600]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:30:23.140 --> 01:30:23.420]  Tim Geithner?
[01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:23.861]  Bernanke?
[01:30:23.961 --> 01:30:24.561]  They're arsonists!
[01:30:24.601 --> 01:30:25.382]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:30:25.722 --> 01:30:28.145]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:30:42.037 --> 01:30:43.880]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:48.926]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:30:49.327 --> 01:30:58.439]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[01:31:53.013 --> 01:31:53.834]  Thank you!
[01:32:00.216 --> 01:32:04.459]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:32:04.759 --> 01:32:05.039]  Number 1.
[01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:08.822]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:09.102 --> 01:32:09.662]  Number 2.
[01:32:09.963 --> 01:32:14.526]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:14.866 --> 01:32:15.306]  It's true.
[01:32:15.606 --> 01:32:20.169]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:20.470 --> 01:32:21.010]  Number 3.
[01:32:21.290 --> 01:32:24.592]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:24.892 --> 01:32:28.575]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:28.775 --> 01:32:29.336]  Number 4.
[01:32:29.576 --> 01:32:31.938]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:32.339 --> 01:32:35.722]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:32:36.023 --> 01:32:36.243]  Number 5.
[01:32:36.823 --> 01:32:40.748]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:32:40.968 --> 01:32:45.733]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:32:46.013 --> 01:32:50.054]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:50.174 --> 01:32:51.754]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:51.954 --> 01:32:54.055]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:32:54.215 --> 01:32:56.816]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:32:56.836 --> 01:33:11.479]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:11.959 --> 01:33:14.500]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:21.226 --> 01:33:22.127]  We are back live.
[01:33:22.228 --> 01:33:24.571]  Dr. Nick Baggage riding shotgun with us.
[01:33:24.591 --> 01:33:25.172]  Honored to have him.
[01:33:25.192 --> 01:33:26.214]  We're going to go back to him in a moment.
[01:33:26.754 --> 01:33:29.919]  You know, we're carrying two new films, one of which I produced.
[01:33:31.229 --> 01:33:43.420]  One illustrates the political rulers of this planet and their open call to set up a global planetary dictatorship for the orderly population reduction of at least 80% of the planet.
[01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:48.324]  And then a scientific dictatorship over the 500 million that remain.
[01:33:48.704 --> 01:33:54.950]  So we know they've built this system and are accelerating its completion and we know that they do not have our interest
[01:33:55.350 --> 01:33:55.630]  I don't
[01:34:17.702 --> 01:34:20.364]  Turns out, that's exactly what they are spraying.
[01:34:20.444 --> 01:34:22.825]  The patents for mixing it in the jet fuel, you name it.
[01:34:23.666 --> 01:34:28.389]  It is What in the World Are They Spraying?, all available at the online video bookstore of Infowars.com.
[01:34:28.849 --> 01:34:32.552]  And they are discounted, I might add, for you.
[01:34:32.892 --> 01:34:34.453]  You can also call toll-free 888.
[01:34:36.334 --> 01:34:41.716]  2 5 3 3 1 3 9 8 8 8 2 5 3 3 1 3 9 or write to us P.O.
[01:34:41.736 --> 01:34:44.697]  Box 1 9 5 4 9 Austin, Texas 7 8 7 6 0.
[01:34:47.078 --> 01:34:48.818]  Going back to Dr. Nick Begich.
[01:34:49.178 --> 01:34:50.559]  Start over because that was a short segment.
[01:34:50.579 --> 01:34:51.759]  You got interrupted by the break.
[01:34:52.439 --> 01:34:55.760]  You were getting into going to this important global meeting.
[01:34:55.800 --> 01:34:58.121]  You've also advised the EU Parliament.
[01:34:58.861 --> 01:34:59.682]  You also again
[01:35:01.222 --> 01:35:04.003]  I mean, are really covering serious issues here.
[01:35:05.204 --> 01:35:07.284]  And so go back to the point, you were having an argument.
[01:35:07.545 --> 01:35:09.465]  Will it be chemical suppression?
[01:35:09.505 --> 01:35:12.306]  We know that's the old 60-year-old system of fluoride in the water.
[01:35:12.666 --> 01:35:14.047]  Or will it be electromagnetic?
[01:35:14.087 --> 01:35:14.427]  Go ahead.
[01:35:14.687 --> 01:35:27.112]  Right, and so we had this discussion and the biggest concern of the folks with the chemical model was, yeah, and their answer was, it ran kind of like this, yeah, we know about all that, but it's hard enough to tell the public.
[01:35:27.782 --> 01:35:33.809]  About the chemicals, much less their interactions now with all these various forms of energy surrounding us.
[01:35:34.129 --> 01:35:35.491]  But let me explain just a little bit.
[01:35:35.531 --> 01:35:39.255]  You know, when you look at Tesla's work, and I've read all of his patents,
[01:35:39.875 --> 01:35:50.939]  I've looked at all of his work in English and in German, and in looking at Tesla, his big thing really boils down to one thing, and it's resonance, harmonies.
[01:35:52.119 --> 01:36:01.682]  The ability to transmit a signal and receive a signal has everything to do with resonance, and creating resonant signals and reactions.
[01:36:01.902 --> 01:36:03.543]  So when you look at that in sort of the
[01:36:04.341 --> 01:36:10.143]  The mechanical side of the world, although he did touch into health issues through his diathermy units and others.
[01:36:10.963 --> 01:36:21.086]  Then I look at my good friend Rahel McHale's work as an electrophysiologist, looking at the same mechanism but applying it to living things, particularly humans.
[01:36:21.778 --> 01:36:32.671]  When you look at how that works, as you can have, for instance, all of us have a little bit of iodine in our body, and we need that, and it regulates a lot of our biological functions.
[01:36:32.712 --> 01:36:34.454]  If we don't have enough, we've got problems.
[01:36:34.474 --> 01:36:36.897]  If we have way too much, we have a toxic situation.
[01:36:38.419 --> 01:37:06.706]  There was a guy named Becker who wrote some excellent work that used this as an example, and you can send in, for instance, a signal that harmonizes with iodine, and actually, when you then look at the body, the person being impacted by this external signal, they show all the symptoms of iodine poisoning, except when you do the blood work to check the thyroid, there's no indication of why that could be, just the symptoms appear, a mystery illness, if you will, and it's
[01:37:07.575 --> 01:37:10.477]  It's the same effect as the chemicals without them.
[01:37:10.537 --> 01:37:21.065]  Now you think about that for a moment and you start to apply that to sort of the randomness of signals that come across and through us every day of various ways.
[01:37:21.285 --> 01:37:33.574]  So not just premeditated governments or corporations with these technologies, but what about the cell phones and the wireless and being bathed in this frequency pollution?
[01:37:33.954 --> 01:37:41.685]  This is actually in Europe, and I know people are going to say it's another greeny conspiracy, but actually it's not.
[01:37:41.745 --> 01:37:48.135]  There was Swiss Reinsurance went and looked at the insurance industry, and they are like one of the guys that tell the rest of the industry,
[01:37:49.296 --> 01:37:52.117]  Don't insure these risks because you'll lose your rear end.
[01:37:52.197 --> 01:38:06.384]  And what they said about electromagnetic pollution, or what they called electro-smog, is anyone who insures these kinds of risks, in terms of physical effects, it will likely lead to the bankruptcy of the insurance industry if we start to insure these risks.
[01:38:06.444 --> 01:38:09.165]  Even Lloyd's of London, at my last check, would not.
[01:38:09.925 --> 01:38:10.985]  We're good to go.
[01:38:29.042 --> 01:38:38.992]  If you take that and you overlay it across everything we've done, and this is one of the observations in Europe, in Europe they noticed that a certain species of pine tree was just dying out.
[01:38:39.032 --> 01:38:40.173]  They couldn't figure it out.
[01:38:40.919 --> 01:39:04.701]  And then people started to look at the science, and these forests were sitting between microwave transmitters that were transmitting millimeter waves, very short wavelengths, that happened to correlate, to harmonize, with the needles of that particular pine tree, and they acted like little antennas receiving that signal, but then altering the nature of those plants and causing them to die off.
[01:39:05.433 --> 01:39:07.094]  That is how resonance works.
[01:39:07.114 --> 01:39:15.618]  You know, when you think about the bees and what's going on with bees right now... And by the way, let me just interrupt you, because I want to... That was all over mainstream news in the last month.
[01:39:16.018 --> 01:39:27.184]  It is confirmed that this is going on, but I've just talked to highway repair crews, because I've seen this visually myself, and I've said, are you cutting the plants?
[01:39:28.004 --> 01:39:31.586]  More often right around these microwave towers?
[01:39:33.027 --> 01:39:33.768]  And they'll say no.
[01:39:34.028 --> 01:39:40.932]  And I'll say, well, I mean, have you noticed that the grass doesn't grow as fast or doesn't grow as well or is dead when it gets dry?
[01:39:41.552 --> 01:39:42.553]  And they said, absolutely.
[01:39:42.593 --> 01:39:50.898]  I mean, you can drive around and just visually see how unhealthy plants are around these towers.
[01:39:50.938 --> 01:39:53.980]  And there's all the studies about increases in tumors.
[01:39:54.881 --> 01:39:56.442]  I mean, as you know, for decades, schools.
[01:39:57.162 --> 01:40:05.067]  Would get money to put a cell phone tower right on top of the school, and then the kids on the third floor, you know, massive cancer, same things in buildings.
[01:40:05.647 --> 01:40:10.029]  I mean, we know, I mean, how many thousands of studies have shown the same thing?
[01:40:10.490 --> 01:40:15.452]  Well, plenty, and I'll tell you, even other health authorities around the world pay attention to it.
[01:40:15.472 --> 01:40:23.577]  The German health authorities do not allow towers to be erected around places where children congregate, daycare centers and schools.
[01:40:24.229 --> 01:40:35.056]  They, in Europe, in Great Britain, they warn parents every school year before school begins, don't let your kids use cell phones under a certain age because they're still developing and the effects of these are pretty profound.
[01:40:35.096 --> 01:40:42.281]  And the difference is they use what's called the precautionary principle in Europe on environmental and health issues, where they start to tell the public.
[01:40:42.641 --> 01:40:46.984]  About the time the insurance companies start to get concerned, the public gets to get the information.
[01:40:47.024 --> 01:40:53.909]  So we get to make the same kind of decision some insurance company gets to make, which is, do we want to take the risk or not, even though
[01:40:54.569 --> 01:40:56.271]  All the science might not be in.
[01:40:56.371 --> 01:41:01.857]  And you know, in over 40 years that they've applied this principle throughout Europe, they have never once been wrong.
[01:41:02.057 --> 01:41:09.445]  Well, I mean, to magnify that, that's just like the FDA doesn't want us to know if we have a genetically engineered cross-species salmon.
[01:41:09.785 --> 01:41:13.810]  I mean, in America, we have to fight to even know if we're eating a clone.
[01:41:14.261 --> 01:41:20.303]  Well, you know, here in Alaska we don't allow farmed salmon because we actually have a good product.
[01:41:20.383 --> 01:41:21.624]  It's created naturally.
[01:41:22.024 --> 01:41:24.745]  We're the 12th largest fishery in the world.
[01:41:24.785 --> 01:41:28.186]  That's ranking us against every country in the world, Alaska alone.
[01:41:28.326 --> 01:41:34.668]  We produce 90% of all of the fresh caught salmon that people consume in the United States.
[01:41:34.808 --> 01:41:35.768]  Most people don't know it.
[01:41:36.129 --> 01:41:37.089]  And there is a difference.
[01:41:37.149 --> 01:41:39.930]  When you start to genetically modify, and this gets back in,
[01:41:41.731 --> 01:41:54.600]  You can deliberately manipulate salmon species so they grow 30 times faster by messing around with the DNA, but you can also alter salmon species in a couple of other ways.
[01:41:54.641 --> 01:42:03.407]  You can alter their migration patterns because they orient by magnetic field lines, and our technologies are now interfering, causing disruptions in those migrations.
[01:42:04.053 --> 01:42:14.295]  And secondly, you can alter, using again electromagnetic fields, you can manipulate what happens within DNA structures.
[01:42:14.675 --> 01:42:19.976]  So you can alter species, either accidentally, as a side effect, or a delivered effect.
[01:42:20.036 --> 01:42:21.696]  And this is again where the problem comes in.
[01:42:21.736 --> 01:42:30.238]  You know those same microwaves that transfer all of our communications, a slight change, just a slight change in the wavelength.
[01:42:30.478 --> 01:42:31.118]  We're good to go.
[01:42:51.431 --> 01:42:54.172]  But in between the stations, it's just static.
[01:42:54.593 --> 01:42:55.813]  No harm, no foul.
[01:42:56.794 --> 01:42:59.335]  That's what we need to learn to express.
[01:42:59.395 --> 01:43:04.217]  So much of the work in this area has been classified for weapons application, yet...
[01:43:04.833 --> 01:43:09.375]  The understanding of sort of what areas and what energy ranges do you avoid?
[01:43:09.836 --> 01:43:14.158]  We used to think it was just high-energy, heat-producing kind of energy, but it's not.
[01:43:14.518 --> 01:43:23.043]  The subtle energies also have huge effects, and we can segregate that through knowledge and then run our technologies in a much safer, conducive way.
[01:43:23.143 --> 01:43:27.245]  In fact, there are certain energy fields that actually increase
[01:43:28.967 --> 01:43:31.830]  Our potential health-wise rather than depressive.
[01:43:31.950 --> 01:43:45.227]  And so we need to be more mindful of what we're doing and be more deliberate in it so that we don't interfere with people and living creatures and that we're good stewards on this planet in a balanced and appropriate way.
[01:43:46.849 --> 01:43:53.151]  In your gut, Dr. Nick Baggage, do you believe humanity is going to make it to a Type 1 civilization?
[01:43:53.191 --> 01:43:58.453]  For those that don't know, that means a civilization viable, not just bound to this planet.
[01:43:58.493 --> 01:44:00.714]  I mean, will humanity survive?
[01:44:00.754 --> 01:44:04.796]  Because the attitudes and the behaviors of the globalists is, they seem to
[01:44:06.036 --> 01:44:22.953]  Social Darwin, in a social Darwinistic way, just embrace anything, no matter how horrible, and they make a lot of self-destructive, nihilistic statements, and they claim there's this big method to their madness, and they're good at screwing stuff up and stealing and robbing.
[01:44:23.954 --> 01:44:35.257]  But I don't have a lot of confidence unless free humanity forces a renaissance of real debate and then takes control of our global civilization and forces a real debate about this.
[01:44:35.617 --> 01:44:43.939]  I don't have a lot of hope for us and I unfortunately, you know, don't even know if I'll be able to live to see grandchildren if we don't turn this around.
[01:44:43.979 --> 01:44:44.939]  What's your gut tell you?
[01:44:45.495 --> 01:44:53.276]  Well, I am obviously concerned or I wouldn't be engaged in the work, and I joke with people, like, I call myself a pathological optimist.
[01:44:54.557 --> 01:44:56.937]  Because I still think there's a way for humanity through this.
[01:44:57.337 --> 01:45:00.197]  I just really believe that, and I believe it on a fundamental basis.
[01:45:00.258 --> 01:45:14.700]  I think that human beings, and this is my personal belief, you can debate it or not, but I believe that human beings are created in the image of a creator, and that means a lot more than some physical form walking around eating Cheerios.
[01:45:15.280 --> 01:45:20.123]  We are very potent as human beings, each and every one of us.
[01:45:20.163 --> 01:45:22.904]  There is no insignificant human on this planet.
[01:45:22.924 --> 01:45:26.466]  I don't care what you think, where you think you sit at the moment.
[01:45:26.926 --> 01:45:34.570]  You have the ability, we each have the ability to step forward into what we are and what we've been created to be, which is a much different
[01:45:35.190 --> 01:45:35.630]  I think so.
[01:45:52.324 --> 01:45:53.205]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:46:08.664 --> 01:46:12.186]  Creativity of the human spirit, and I want us to have that destiny.
[01:46:12.627 --> 01:46:28.037]  I'm saying if we don't, those of us that can see it intellectually and feel it in our gut and know it, if we don't act on our survival instincts and then intellectually and scientifically face this and blow the horn, warning people, I think the globalists are going to destroy all of us.
[01:46:28.678 --> 01:46:31.319]  I think you're right on that, and I think it is up to us.
[01:46:31.780 --> 01:46:36.463]  You know, when you talk about mind control issues, and I've researched them now for many, many years,
[01:46:37.389 --> 01:46:44.396]  You know, the biggest thing that the military discovered in all of this wasn't, you know, the kinds of things people usually default to out of fear.
[01:46:44.436 --> 01:46:49.841]  It's about the Manchurian kind of candidate or about manipulating me or each of us to do certain things.
[01:46:49.861 --> 01:46:53.905]  You know, that kind of feeling of imposition and the fear that goes with it.
[01:46:54.005 --> 01:46:57.789]  And here is the reality of fear and worry and anxiety.
[01:46:57.829 --> 01:47:01.513]  If you look at an EEG brain activity of people experiencing those emotions,
[01:47:02.068 --> 01:47:07.291]  The kind of brain activity you see is not associated with intellectual processing of any great degree.
[01:47:07.711 --> 01:47:13.995]  It's not associated with the kind of thinking and higher-order capability that humans often demonstrate.
[01:47:14.456 --> 01:47:20.879]  Those brain waves are only demonstrated when you're experiencing the emotions of compassion, empathy, love.
[01:47:20.939 --> 01:47:21.200]  Yes.
[01:47:22.180 --> 01:47:26.643]  And those emotions are associated with higher-order thinking, and that higher-order thinking
[01:47:27.163 --> 01:47:27.644]  We're good.
[01:47:41.346 --> 01:47:48.072]  How we use our gifts and what those are intended to do will change the face of this planet.
[01:47:48.172 --> 01:47:49.153]  And I believe that.
[01:47:49.293 --> 01:47:50.074]  Absolutely believe it.
[01:47:50.094 --> 01:47:52.296]  I totally agree, Dr. Begich, and I want you to elaborate on this.
[01:47:52.376 --> 01:48:02.465]  That's why the social engineers, who are greedy and wicked, who know these secrets and consciously decide to dumb us down so that we're not in the equation
[01:48:03.346 --> 01:48:06.648]  of having any input on the type of civilization we build.
[01:48:06.968 --> 01:48:16.953]  That's why everything they do is to create a false, almost matrix of disinformation and media control to suppress us within small boxes.
[01:48:16.973 --> 01:48:25.037]  And for me, at a gut level, that is the ultimate crime against the species, the ultimate crime against who we are.
[01:48:25.457 --> 01:48:29.319]  And I just burn with a desire to defeat these people.
[01:48:29.844 --> 01:48:32.866]  Well, and I think that is possible.
[01:48:32.886 --> 01:48:37.188]  It doesn't take millions and millions of people to make change in the world.
[01:48:37.228 --> 01:48:39.709]  It takes one or two to see it slightly differently.
[01:48:40.309 --> 01:48:43.651]  And I won't say sound the alarm like you're in a panic.
[01:48:44.184 --> 01:48:49.768]  But to awaken the rest of our brothers and sisters on this planet to our possibilities.
[01:48:49.888 --> 01:48:56.092]  And I think that's where so much of what we've seen is about tearing things down rather than building them up.
[01:48:56.132 --> 01:48:58.293]  And we have an opportunity to build one another up.
[01:48:58.753 --> 01:49:05.338]  This planet can, I say this loudly, it can support the billions of people that live here.
[01:49:05.498 --> 01:49:10.221]  No one arrived by accident and anyone who believes that I think has missed
[01:49:11.251 --> 01:49:14.633]  The deeper meaning of this experience, and we have an opportunity.
[01:49:15.074 --> 01:49:31.284]  This generation is the generation that will decide whether or not we have a world that frees us to our higher possibilities and potentials or continues to suppress us in really what is a scripted program.
[01:49:31.324 --> 01:49:33.125]  I mean, you're not watching the programs.
[01:49:33.685 --> 01:49:38.589]  We are the programs, and we can either change it by recognizing what we are and move forward.
[01:49:38.609 --> 01:49:39.129]  And I think that's
[01:49:39.767 --> 01:49:50.355]  That's really the challenge, and it's overcoming, each of us overcoming our own anxieties and fears and worries and starting to step in with confidence, knowing, A, that we're not alone.
[01:49:50.575 --> 01:49:53.397]  There are, in fact, millions of people doing the same thing.
[01:49:54.057 --> 01:49:57.079]  And we don't have to wait for some formal organization to form.
[01:49:57.099 --> 01:49:58.000]  We're already standing in it.
[01:49:58.020 --> 01:50:08.147]  It was created long ago with the human race, and we need to rise to the potential that was given us as our birthright and claim it back and change the world around us.
[01:50:08.187 --> 01:50:09.208]  I mean, it's so easy
[01:50:10.249 --> 01:50:16.454]  I know to get lost in the fear and worry of the times we're facing economically, socially, technologically.
[01:50:17.315 --> 01:50:20.738]  But you know, we are at a crossroads and everyone feels it and everyone knows it.
[01:50:21.318 --> 01:50:24.601]  And again, I want to emphasize there are no insignificant events.
[01:50:24.641 --> 01:50:27.283]  People need to step into what they believe to be right and true.
[01:50:27.784 --> 01:50:34.309]  Begin acting responsibly, not with fear and worry, but with confidence, knowing that each step we take is a step in a different and a right direction.
[01:50:34.921 --> 01:50:37.184]  Wow, Dr. Begich, so beautifully said.
[01:50:37.244 --> 01:50:38.165]  Extremely profound.
[01:50:38.205 --> 01:50:43.172]  I think that's some of the most powerful things you've ever said on this broadcast of many powerful broadcasts.
[01:50:43.973 --> 01:50:44.553]  I want to talk.
[01:50:45.686 --> 01:50:49.527]  More about this awakening, and you can feel it, I can feel it, we can see it.
[01:50:50.208 --> 01:50:57.350]  The awakening is on, and the global controllers are throwing everything they can at us right now to try to suppress that awakening.
[01:50:57.470 --> 01:50:59.051]  Why are they so afraid of it?
[01:50:59.311 --> 01:51:00.531]  We'll ask the doctor on the other side.
[01:51:00.831 --> 01:51:01.632]  Pure water.
[01:51:01.952 --> 01:51:04.413]  What could be better than the gift of health for your loved ones?
[01:51:04.653 --> 01:51:08.214]  And who better to help you give the gift this holiday season than Big Berkey Water
[01:51:12.975 --> 01:51:13.915]  We're good to go!
[01:51:42.483 --> 01:51:42.723]  All right.
[01:52:00.489 --> 01:52:01.749]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:01.809 --> 01:52:07.131]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:07.391 --> 01:52:12.013]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:12.413 --> 01:52:12.793]  It's true.
[01:52:12.873 --> 01:52:17.435]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:52:17.975 --> 01:52:22.678]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:23.199 --> 01:52:25.140]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.

[01:53:04.005 --> 01:53:07.787]  My name is Span and I'm 68 years old and I live in Vermont.
[01:53:08.191 --> 01:53:12.675]  In the spring of 2003, I started to have problems with my heart.
[01:53:12.935 --> 01:53:14.837]  It felt like my heart was pounding.
[01:53:14.857 --> 01:53:16.339]  It made me feel breathless.
[01:53:16.739 --> 01:53:20.783]  I tried many, many different things to try to get some help for myself.
[01:53:21.183 --> 01:53:22.184]  Nothing did anything.

[01:53:26.248 --> 01:53:29.691]  I saw one of Sharon's ads and ordered Heart and Body Extract.

[01:54:05.228 --> 01:54:08.491]  Okay, folks, Dr. Nick Baggage will be with us about 15-20 minutes to the next hour.
[01:54:08.811 --> 01:54:14.757]  We will take some calls for Dr. Nick Baggage specifically on any questions you've got, but please call in for Dr. Nick Baggage.
[01:54:14.777 --> 01:54:14.817]  800-259-9231.
[01:54:14.837 --> 01:54:14.877]  800-259-9231.
[01:54:14.897 --> 01:54:17.539]  Dr. Baggage, we were talking during the break about the Global Social Engineers.
[01:54:17.559 --> 01:54:19.681]  We know there are several different power blocks.
[01:54:28.809 --> 01:54:38.675]  And I know they know these secrets that we're discussing here, but they've made the conscious decision to do dehumanizing things so they greedily can control the future.
[01:54:39.135 --> 01:54:45.159]  And I was asking you, how can they know these great truths and consciously turn against those?
[01:54:45.439 --> 01:54:57.427]  How, when they tune in to what those of us that have discovered the larger scope of reality, how could they gaze upon this and the human potential and decide to engage in the type of activities they are?
[01:54:58.274 --> 01:55:02.897]  Well, firstly, I'll tell you two things that are very telling in this.
[01:55:03.157 --> 01:55:08.440]  Firstly, what all that research showed was that people have these capabilities latent within us.
[01:55:08.560 --> 01:55:17.304]  In fact, there's two studies being done by DARPA now in California for looking at methods for figuring out how telepathy works, mental telepathy, knowing what people think.
[01:55:17.825 --> 01:55:23.708]  Now imagine yourself being in the New World Order crowd and the population knowing what you think.
[01:55:24.682 --> 01:55:29.744]  You know, there's a lot of people with a lot of dark secrets that would prefer not to have them open in the light of day.
[01:55:30.304 --> 01:55:39.907]  And that's, that's, again, part of this fear is if people really had these potentials active in their lives on a regular basis, there would be no place to hide.
[01:55:39.987 --> 01:55:40.888]  We'd be laid bare.
[01:55:40.968 --> 01:55:41.188]  I mean,
[01:55:42.034 --> 01:55:42.654]  Think about it.
[01:55:43.335 --> 01:55:49.118]  All of our sins, all of our good things that have happened in our life laid bare.
[01:55:50.239 --> 01:55:53.861]  But that's already there, just people don't know how to recognize it.
[01:55:53.941 --> 01:55:58.304]  I don't want to get off into this, but I've had many dreams that come true exactly.
[01:55:58.324 --> 01:56:01.246]  I constantly, I mean it's just constant.
[01:56:01.606 --> 01:56:08.230]  And then most people just don't know how to recognize that it's already there, that we're already electromagnetically tied into everything.
[01:56:08.450 --> 01:56:12.732]  Yeah, and the fact is, every once in a while we get little glimpses, and all of us have experienced that.
[01:56:12.792 --> 01:56:14.352]  We go, wow, that was really interesting.
[01:56:14.392 --> 01:56:22.115]  But here's what also is known, is that there's specific biological activity that is associated with those kinds of events.
[01:56:22.235 --> 01:56:31.019]  And this is where the science went in the 60s and 70s, is figuring out, hey, can we make someone else experience these same kinds of things?
[01:56:31.059 --> 01:56:36.541]  And as they discovered that everybody, every human has a natural capacity for these things,
[01:56:37.347 --> 01:56:38.228]  Scared the heck out of them.
[01:56:38.648 --> 01:56:45.592]  And then the question, well, how do you control this kind of activity from breaking out, you know, within populations where they can actually be free?
[01:56:46.372 --> 01:57:01.661]  You do it with fear and worry, because you really, I'm telling you, if you look at this under, with scientific instruments to measure brain activity, you cannot, I repeat, you cannot reach higher states of consciousness as long as you are worried and fearful.
[01:57:02.121 --> 01:57:03.262]  And think back on
[01:57:03.875 --> 01:57:05.215]  I don't
[01:57:21.115 --> 01:57:23.675]  The logic and the good sense of good argument.
[01:57:23.835 --> 01:57:25.176]  And that's what's driving so much.
[01:57:25.216 --> 01:57:27.936]  And here's the other part of the problem, is the planners.
[01:57:28.476 --> 01:57:29.356]  Military planners.
[01:57:29.496 --> 01:57:36.558]  You know, in the military, in the West, it's in a closet, because they're not run by the military, they're run by the civilian sector.
[01:57:36.578 --> 01:57:45.779]  And the reason for that is military has to have this sort of paranoid mindset, where they think of every horrible thing that could ever happen, and then build a plan to safeguard the country.
[01:57:46.099 --> 01:57:46.879]  That's their job.
[01:57:46.979 --> 01:57:48.140]  And I don't begrudge them for it.
[01:57:48.200 --> 01:57:49.900]  In fact, I'm glad they're there doing that job.
[01:57:50.600 --> 01:58:03.567]  But because that thinking has to do with distrust, has to do with dealing with the evilest of evil, people then look at this as, okay, what do we do to get on top of this, to keep people from falling into these positions?
[01:58:03.627 --> 01:58:08.410]  And then you have bureaucrats deciding that maybe they know best what people ought to be thinking.
[01:58:08.666 --> 01:58:10.447]  Well, they call it full-spectrum dominance.
[01:58:10.487 --> 01:58:13.068]  They say the truth must be guarded by a bodyguard of lies.
[01:58:13.168 --> 01:58:20.270]  They fill every vacuum of possible evil in the name of full-spectrum dominance, but they have now become evil.
[01:58:20.350 --> 01:58:25.752]  They have not defeated all the avenues of other evil by filling every criminal spectrum.
[01:58:26.092 --> 01:58:26.292]  Right.
[01:58:26.552 --> 01:58:30.374]  It's like the war on terror is the most re-established freedom.
[01:58:30.394 --> 01:58:33.295]  We've got the most oppressed, surveyed society ever.
[01:58:34.409 --> 01:58:34.871]  Exactly.
[01:58:34.931 --> 01:58:35.353]  Stay there.
[01:58:35.975 --> 01:58:37.823]  Analyzing the enemy attack profile, though.
[01:58:37.883 --> 01:58:38.987]  It's completely premeditated.
[01:58:39.007 --> 01:58:39.469]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:40.501 --> 01:58:43.462]  Are you tired of searching for great talk radio?
[01:58:43.482 --> 01:58:44.982]  Something more important.
[01:58:45.142 --> 01:58:46.382]  Search no more.
[01:58:46.602 --> 01:58:50.083]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:50.543 --> 01:58:54.224]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot Movement.
[01:58:54.384 --> 01:58:58.405]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[01:58:58.645 --> 01:59:03.446]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[01:59:03.486 --> 01:59:08.447]  Looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[01:59:09.287 --> 01:59:34.785]  Not worried about them moving south Closing the doors and shutting her down Tomorrow I'm looking for America Land on the free and the home of the brave Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone
[01:59:45.043 --> 01:59:49.689]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[01:59:53.594 --> 01:59:55.516]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:55.977 --> 01:59:58.760]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.287 --> 02:00:09.473]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.134 --> 02:00:10.935]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.716 --> 02:00:12.618]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.638 --> 02:00:16.924]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.465 --> 02:00:21.510]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.422 --> 02:00:28.227]  I tell you, I think during the breaks a lot of times it's even better radio than on air with these guests.
[02:00:28.267 --> 02:00:31.751]  I mean, I'm just as intrigued and excited as you are, even more so.
[02:00:32.712 --> 02:00:34.814]  Constant discussions with my guests during the breaks.
[02:00:35.495 --> 02:00:42.403]  But it is the breaks that allow us, you know, in this system to get the energy cubes we need to be on air and, you know, finance this whole thing.
[02:00:42.443 --> 02:00:43.964]  So it is symbiotic and we appreciate...
[02:00:44.545 --> 02:00:53.733]  All of our sponsors, but I was bringing up the fact, really asking Dr. Begich to judge who I am, because it's always good to have outside perspectives.
[02:00:54.313 --> 02:01:03.701]  And I said, well, you know, I really am fearless, but it's because I know I've got to do this because it's the right direction and that we are basically going down the wrong road if I don't.
[02:01:03.941 --> 02:01:06.023]  So it's not a thing of courage fighting corruption.
[02:01:06.424 --> 02:01:09.006]  It's something I've got to do, like a tropism.
[02:01:09.486 --> 02:01:11.067]  You know, something that's just ingrained in me.
[02:01:11.387 --> 02:01:13.389]  But sometimes it comes off like fear.
[02:01:13.669 --> 02:01:21.895]  For me, if my neighbor's house is on fire and I call him and say, wake up, your house is on fire, that's not fear, that's taking action.
[02:01:21.975 --> 02:01:22.195]  Right.
[02:01:22.675 --> 02:01:24.697]  And Dr. Begich agreed with me.
[02:01:24.757 --> 02:01:28.540]  I mean, what's your view on yourself and what you do, what I'm doing?
[02:01:28.760 --> 02:01:29.800]  Yeah, I think that's true.
[02:01:29.860 --> 02:01:31.261]  And you know, each of us have a gift.
[02:01:31.742 --> 02:01:36.085]  And when we recognize the gift and begin to work within it, it doesn't create fear.
[02:01:36.105 --> 02:01:38.947]  It creates the opposite confidence, a sense of
[02:01:39.554 --> 02:01:40.074]  I don't know.
[02:02:00.453 --> 02:02:01.753]  You know, as an individual, I don't.
[02:02:01.993 --> 02:02:03.894]  I know you don't, Alex.
[02:02:03.954 --> 02:02:07.695]  And it's because we're doing what we know we can do, what we're capable of doing.
[02:02:07.735 --> 02:02:08.776]  We know we're not alone.
[02:02:08.836 --> 02:02:11.076]  We're being assisted in lots of different ways.
[02:02:11.576 --> 02:02:15.758]  But we move forward in that knowledge safely and confidently and without fear.
[02:02:16.198 --> 02:02:23.480]  If you're experiencing fear and worry as you engage a conflict, perhaps you need to pull back a little bit.
[02:02:23.919 --> 02:02:24.219]  I think so.
[02:02:39.794 --> 02:02:46.079]  You have a lot of risk, and I don't think we're ever put into a battle that we're not equipped to fight, but we have to know that going into the battle.
[02:02:46.199 --> 02:02:50.362]  So each one that we each individually pick becomes incredibly important.
[02:02:50.382 --> 02:02:53.684]  Yeah, if you are hearing a Danger Will Robinson, back off!
[02:02:53.864 --> 02:02:54.445]  Ease back!
[02:02:54.865 --> 02:02:59.028]  I mean, my problem, Dr. Megich is, I never hear the Danger Will Robinson.
[02:02:59.448 --> 02:03:00.829]  It's just full speed ahead!
[02:03:01.510 --> 02:03:08.415]  But you know, occasionally, I gotta say this, occasionally though, Alex, and I know you do this as well as I do, you'll be in the course of your work, you'll run into someone,
[02:03:09.164 --> 02:03:11.445]  That you just have that sinking bad feeling about?
[02:03:11.545 --> 02:03:11.825]  Yes.
[02:03:12.226 --> 02:03:18.269]  And you just go, well, I don't know why, I don't know how, but I'm just going to ignore this situation or avoid this individual.
[02:03:18.289 --> 02:03:20.610]  Then six months rolls by and you figure out why.
[02:03:21.510 --> 02:03:22.971]  Well, I think that's important.
[02:03:23.091 --> 02:03:32.636]  And so it's not really fear as much as it is awareness, again, of what's around you and what can come against you and whose interests you're opposing.
[02:03:32.676 --> 02:03:36.318]  Because people like to keep their self-interest preserved.
[02:03:36.358 --> 02:03:38.639]  And when you're stepping on toes, as we are,
[02:03:39.598 --> 02:03:43.159]  You know, you can cite some people, but, you know, I look at it this way.
[02:03:43.319 --> 02:03:44.299]  That's great.
[02:03:44.339 --> 02:03:45.340]  That means it's working.
[02:03:45.580 --> 02:03:48.120]  You know, when they start hammering on you, it's working.
[02:03:48.140 --> 02:03:52.261]  And you can look at the work we've done over the years, and it does make its way in.
[02:03:52.321 --> 02:04:02.064]  You know, in a number of the technical reports dealing with personal privacy issues, Earth Pulse and the work that we've done is cited there because it's quality material.
[02:04:02.084 --> 02:04:05.625]  The stuff that we do to alert the public and stimulate activity
[02:04:06.377 --> 02:04:08.198]  It's just that, stimulating activity.
[02:04:08.238 --> 02:04:13.800]  But the listeners, people who hear these words and act on them, do things that we could never do.
[02:04:14.380 --> 02:04:18.182]  And people go, well, I'm just this little guy doing this little thing.
[02:04:18.222 --> 02:04:19.022]  Well, you don't know.
[02:04:19.042 --> 02:04:24.525]  A guy walking down the street, just as simple as a smile to the guy walking the other way.
[02:04:24.985 --> 02:04:29.407]  And the guy walking the other way maybe gets that bit of encouragement and goes off and creates
[02:04:30.007 --> 02:04:31.187]  Some great invention.
[02:04:31.247 --> 02:04:33.808]  Now, who is the stimulator of that invention?
[02:04:33.848 --> 02:04:34.988]  The guy who invented it?
[02:04:35.448 --> 02:04:38.709]  Or the guy who acted as the catalyst by a little duplicity?
[02:04:39.549 --> 02:04:41.149]  I think the guy who acted as the catalyst.
[02:04:41.169 --> 02:04:43.449]  And each of us is a catalyst for change.
[02:04:43.469 --> 02:04:49.691]  Well, it's the listeners of this broadcast that make it so incredibly powerful and dangerous to the globalist paradigm.
[02:04:49.711 --> 02:04:51.171]  We're going to come back and take phone calls.
[02:04:51.191 --> 02:04:53.651]  This has been one of the most amazing interviews ever with Dr. Nick Baggage.
[02:04:53.991 --> 02:04:56.552]  The awakening, the quickening is accelerating.
[02:04:56.572 --> 02:04:57.552]  You can all feel it.
[02:05:01.304 --> 02:05:03.907]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:05:04.307 --> 02:05:09.271]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:05:09.651 --> 02:05:11.393]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:05:11.693 --> 02:05:16.497]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:05:16.697 --> 02:05:17.638]  How much do you want?
[02:05:17.878 --> 02:05:18.619]  When do you want it?
[02:05:18.999 --> 02:05:20.601]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:05:20.881 --> 02:05:21.702]  When will you need it?
[02:05:21.962 --> 02:05:24.024]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:05:24.164 --> 02:05:25.265]  Will there be any food?
[02:05:25.505 --> 02:05:26.806]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:05:27.006 --> 02:05:32.072]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:05:32.272 --> 02:05:35.456]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:05:35.876 --> 02:05:39.360]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:05:39.681 --> 02:05:40.662]  How much will you need?
[02:05:40.922 --> 02:05:41.523]  We don't know.
[02:05:41.823 --> 02:05:42.744]  How much do you want?
[02:05:42.924 --> 02:05:43.645]  All you can get.
[02:05:43.865 --> 02:05:44.706]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:05:44.947 --> 02:05:47.670]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:05:47.990 --> 02:05:51.092]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:05:51.112 --> 02:05:51.873]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:06:00.339 --> 02:06:01.479]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:06:01.519 --> 02:06:08.182]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:06:08.442 --> 02:06:10.723]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:06:11.003 --> 02:06:16.185]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:06:16.385 --> 02:06:19.146]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:06:19.406 --> 02:06:21.467]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:06:21.727 --> 02:06:27.649]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:06:27.969 --> 02:06:31.170]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:06:31.350 --> 02:06:36.872]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:06:37.132 --> 02:06:38.432]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:06:38.772 --> 02:06:39.933]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:06:40.073 --> 02:06:42.613]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:06:42.753 --> 02:06:44.154]  He explains everything you need to know.
[02:06:44.434 --> 02:06:46.795]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:06:46.955 --> 02:06:51.456]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:06:51.596 --> 02:06:54.036]  That's End of America, the number three dot com.

[02:06:58.037 --> 02:06:59.778]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.

[02:08:01.127 --> 02:08:06.729]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:08.210 --> 02:08:12.592]  Dr. Nick Begich is our guest for the rest of this segment, and I've got a bunch of news and your calls to be getting into.
[02:08:12.932 --> 02:08:28.758]  John, Mark, Bill, Donna, we'll get to at least you for Dr. Nick Begich here in a moment, but he said something that really struck home for me, that I've been really focusing on lately, and that's that we're not alone.
[02:08:30.489 --> 02:08:34.170]  There are billions of people on this planet who are now awake.
[02:08:34.710 --> 02:08:38.012]  And Zbigniew Brzezinski, earlier last year, he bemoaned that.
[02:08:38.092 --> 02:08:46.915]  That it doesn't mean people have all the answers, but they're now awakening and shattering the tiny little cave that they've been put into.
[02:08:47.715 --> 02:08:54.957]  And that we stand not just with those that are alive, but literally with all other truth seekers and lovers of liberty throughout history.
[02:08:55.217 --> 02:08:58.118]  And that's the most valuable thing in the world.
[02:08:58.158 --> 02:08:59.759]  It's the only thing that's going to fulfill
[02:09:00.999 --> 02:09:05.640]  I'm totally with you.
[02:09:05.720 --> 02:09:14.383]  And I think all of us, again I want to emphasize, some of the most profound things in my life have been triggered by people who think themselves insignificant.
[02:09:15.223 --> 02:09:23.865]  And man, I just can't say it enough, is we beat ourselves up pretty thoroughly, pretty regularly, because we're sort of the worst critics of ourselves.
[02:09:24.798 --> 02:09:26.859]  But cut yourself just a little bit of slack.
[02:09:27.179 --> 02:09:29.520]  And if you know your problems, try and overcome them.
[02:09:29.620 --> 02:09:33.981]  But more importantly, take control of the things you can't take control of.
[02:09:34.021 --> 02:09:35.842]  And that's where you start to build your confidence back.
[02:09:35.862 --> 02:09:46.805]  You know, on these issues, if somebody asked you or me years ago when we began our work, and it laid out for us the path we would have traveled, we would have looked at them like they were absolutely out of their minds.
[02:09:48.166 --> 02:09:48.546]  And yet,
[02:09:49.306 --> 02:09:54.051]  By stepping into what we could do, we discovered all these other things that we could do.
[02:09:54.291 --> 02:09:56.974]  And I think that's the true nature of this experience.
[02:09:57.414 --> 02:10:07.324]  And, you know, the backdrop of technologies and the evil in the world that so much of what we've had to talk about, you know, that's disturbing to folks.
[02:10:07.364 --> 02:10:09.606]  But again, it's the spirit in which the information is delivered.
[02:10:09.626 --> 02:10:13.150]  Like we were talking off-air, you know, we're there to try and awaken.
[02:10:13.672 --> 02:10:14.473]  We're good to go.
[02:10:27.065 --> 02:10:32.411]  Those words that influence other people's actions make me partially responsible for what others do.
[02:10:45.507 --> 02:10:48.170]  I'm affecting people and I can see the growth curve.
[02:10:48.190 --> 02:10:49.091]  It's exponential.
[02:10:49.111 --> 02:10:54.758]  And then I look at myself and I do beat myself up and I say, you've got to do a better job.
[02:10:55.118 --> 02:10:56.340]  Look at the effects you're having.
[02:10:56.380 --> 02:11:01.626]  But then I realized, look, all I'm doing is the best job I can and I've got a good heart.
[02:11:01.766 --> 02:11:03.007]  I'm going in the right direction.
[02:11:03.348 --> 02:11:04.930]  And so I just turn it over to God.
[02:11:05.359 --> 02:11:07.720]  Yeah, I'm with you there, absolutely with you there.
[02:11:07.940 --> 02:11:15.902]  And I'll tell you, even those of us that do this work every day, we experience all the same kinds of things that everyone else does.
[02:11:17.403 --> 02:11:20.364]  No one's free of anything in terms of tension in their lives.
[02:11:20.424 --> 02:11:24.265]  In fact, busy people tend to have very complex lives.
[02:11:25.281 --> 02:11:27.203]  And that's kind of the way we thrive, I think.
[02:11:28.524 --> 02:11:31.206]  But again, opportunity for change is there.
[02:11:31.626 --> 02:11:41.474]  These technologies offer us great opportunities to enhance our possibilities, and that's a lot of the work that I'm taking in this last year and moving forward.
[02:11:41.854 --> 02:11:53.964]  I stopped lecturing for a couple of years, and I may get back into a little more of that as time moves on, but mainly to get a focus back on sort of a chance to look at what I've been doing, look at the effect of it,
[02:11:54.965 --> 02:12:16.844]  I was about to say I haven't for some reason years blip by and I hadn't called you in over a year to have you on and then I call you and I want to say you sound changed but I think like everybody you sound accelerated in the trajectory you were already on but you sound even more powerful.
[02:12:17.675 --> 02:12:35.902]  I feel like the direction's clear for me and the opportunity now to really offer encouragement and to try and take the messages that we've been giving on technology and show the other side of that sword and really start to focus more on, okay, these are the things that can be done to us.
[02:12:36.002 --> 02:12:38.263]  What can we do ourselves?
[02:12:38.363 --> 02:12:46.806]  What can we do to open up the understanding of what's happening and, more importantly, perhaps trigger some of our own latent
[02:12:50.756 --> 02:12:51.316]  Absolutely.
[02:12:51.736 --> 02:12:54.218]  Let's look for the tools for transformation.
[02:12:54.658 --> 02:12:57.560]  The things that allow us to move forward.
[02:12:58.100 --> 02:12:59.601]  There's two sides to this.
[02:12:59.621 --> 02:13:02.963]  There's a mechanical side of things we can make and build that will help us
[02:13:03.641 --> 02:13:06.882]  Be healthier, think clearer, you know, do those kinds of things.
[02:13:06.982 --> 02:13:12.244]  And then there's a spiritual component that is an individual component that we have to search out in our own ways.
[02:13:12.744 --> 02:13:17.365]  And I'm, you know, I'm not, that is not my direction in life to define that for folks.
[02:13:17.465 --> 02:13:27.508]  But having said that, anyone that I've ever met that's done anything decent in the world has a deep underlying religious philosophical underpinning.
[02:13:28.109 --> 02:13:28.789]  And that matters.
[02:13:29.787 --> 02:13:30.688]  Well, that was my next point.
[02:13:30.708 --> 02:13:33.329]  We've got to get to calls here, or hold you longer if you can do it.
[02:13:33.349 --> 02:13:33.950]  Yeah.
[02:13:33.970 --> 02:13:35.150]  But I promise to get to these.
[02:13:36.011 --> 02:13:37.652]  I'm not bashing atheists.
[02:13:37.752 --> 02:13:39.273]  I don't dislike atheists.
[02:13:39.994 --> 02:13:45.157]  And I run into some who are overall good people, but on average not as good.
[02:13:45.177 --> 02:13:52.902]  And they can always use aberrant, state-driven examples of religion being used as a cover or an envelope for bad.
[02:13:55.343 --> 02:14:02.026]  The people I see facing down real corruption now, I mean, they have an underlying, you know, tie-in to the universe.
[02:14:02.046 --> 02:14:22.494]  They understand that justice, you know, the universe bends towards justice, and I see the globalists always pushing an atheistic view, a cynical view, and, but then when I actually study the New World Order, they are secretly extremely religious, but what would be called the dark side.
[02:14:22.774 --> 02:14:23.795]  Right, I agree with that.
[02:14:24.075 --> 02:14:28.217]  And again, the recognition of what we are is fundamental to the change.
[02:14:28.497 --> 02:14:30.538]  We're talking about changing the way the world works.
[02:14:30.898 --> 02:14:38.542]  We have to change the way we operate as individuals by recognizing first and individually what we are and then begin to act.
[02:14:39.042 --> 02:14:42.984]  And as we do, we learn more about what we're capable of, just like a little child.
[02:14:43.384 --> 02:14:44.124]  It doesn't end.
[02:14:45.205 --> 02:14:45.885]  It continues.
[02:14:45.925 --> 02:14:47.606]  That's the whole living experience.
[02:14:47.806 --> 02:14:49.487]  And we keep being told
[02:14:50.154 --> 02:14:52.616]  Stop thinking, stop contemplating, stop.
[02:14:52.736 --> 02:14:53.997]  Just fall into the herd.
[02:14:54.097 --> 02:14:56.459]  And that is not what humans are intended to be.
[02:14:56.479 --> 02:15:03.744]  And this globalist, elitist type of attitude, this paternalistic type of attitude needs to end.
[02:15:03.764 --> 02:15:05.025]  And I think again,
[02:15:05.680 --> 02:15:06.821]  It's been with us a long time.
[02:15:06.841 --> 02:15:18.633]  You know, religions tend to be corrupted usually a generation or two after as people discover the mysteries within the religion, within the philosophy, that actually, you know, science doesn't operate in a vacuum either.
[02:15:18.653 --> 02:15:23.737]  You know, God created order, and out of that comes, in one sense, some science.
[02:15:25.179 --> 02:15:29.346]  You know, it helps us understand the creation, but it isn't the creation in and of itself.
[02:15:29.547 --> 02:15:35.056]  And that I think is, again, getting back to this basic thing about changing the world requires changing ourselves.
[02:15:35.157 --> 02:15:38.583]  And getting rid of fear and worry is the first step in making that change.
[02:15:39.068 --> 02:15:44.332]  And then opening up our eyes to the things that we can do, and acting on it, and seeking.
[02:15:44.792 --> 02:15:46.954]  I believe it's important to seek the face of God.
[02:15:46.974 --> 02:15:50.996]  Whatever that means to you, I think that is incredibly important.
[02:15:51.117 --> 02:15:52.618]  And in the seeking is the finding.
[02:15:53.178 --> 02:15:55.600]  And I'm not going to tell people... Because that opens you up.
[02:15:55.680 --> 02:15:57.061]  I mean, now the box is gone.
[02:15:57.301 --> 02:16:02.965]  When you start to seek it, then you realize that you can see much further than you thought.
[02:16:02.985 --> 02:16:04.626]  That's exactly it.
[02:16:04.746 --> 02:16:07.088]  And then you also get this recognition you're not alone.
[02:16:07.108 --> 02:16:08.509]  And then you start to recognize
[02:16:09.230 --> 02:16:15.653]  A little bit about what is possible as you start to run into what you call coincidences and you realize they're not coincidences at all.
[02:16:16.053 --> 02:16:20.035]  You start to do things and all of a sudden the resources appear when you didn't think there were any.
[02:16:20.835 --> 02:16:28.039]  Those are, you know, that's miraculous living and it starts with a changed attitude and a changed outlook.
[02:16:28.119 --> 02:16:32.481]  And it is a struggle every single day to change who we are.
[02:16:32.541 --> 02:16:37.283]  But it is critically important to recognize that's what life is on this planet.
[02:16:38.137 --> 02:16:40.318]  From the time we're born to the time we die.
[02:16:40.438 --> 02:16:41.299]  It's an evolution.
[02:16:41.379 --> 02:16:42.559]  It's a recognition of our strength.
[02:16:42.579 --> 02:16:43.040]  Exactly.
[02:16:43.080 --> 02:16:47.062]  The globalists try to create an artificial system where on the surface there's no struggle.
[02:16:47.322 --> 02:16:47.542]  Right.
[02:16:47.562 --> 02:16:53.325]  But in that is actually the death, you know, of your individualistic drive.
[02:16:53.465 --> 02:16:56.326]  It is through the struggle that we are empowered.
[02:16:56.726 --> 02:16:57.267]  Absolutely.
[02:16:57.347 --> 02:16:59.208]  And in fact, that's our best learning environment.
[02:16:59.328 --> 02:17:02.689]  And you know, in the one sense, you know, we're going through a rough time in the economy.
[02:17:03.109 --> 02:17:05.170]  We're going through a lot of rough times around the country.
[02:17:05.230 --> 02:17:06.191]  And we see the awakening.
[02:17:06.531 --> 02:17:20.940]  And the awakening happens because that's when we recognize our own strengths because it's either die or live we have to make choices and then we start to recognize the neighbors that we have around us who we never even saw before who have their hand out and always did.
[02:17:22.821 --> 02:17:23.862]  That's where the change starts.
[02:17:25.680 --> 02:17:26.500]  Well, beautifully said.
[02:17:26.540 --> 02:17:33.382]  Let's take some calls and do one more short segment, because Doc's got to go at 30 after, and I really want to get to these calls, but what a profound interview.
[02:17:33.722 --> 02:17:34.622]  And I talked to the Doc.
[02:17:34.922 --> 02:17:36.162]  It was his idea, but it's funny.
[02:17:36.182 --> 02:17:43.444]  At the same time, I've been thinking about folks to fill in more often when I'm working on films or going out of town, and he just volunteered.
[02:17:43.464 --> 02:17:44.584]  Hey, I could fill in sometime.
[02:17:44.604 --> 02:17:46.064]  So we're getting a great list of folks.
[02:17:46.084 --> 02:17:50.525]  The Health Ranger, Dr. Nick Begich, Paul Joseph Watson, Lou Rockwell.
[02:17:51.045 --> 02:17:54.046]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Colorado.
[02:17:54.426 --> 02:17:56.547]  John, you're our first caller for Dr. Nick Begich.
[02:17:57.648 --> 02:17:58.108]  Yes, hi.
[02:17:58.148 --> 02:17:58.608]  How you doing?
[02:17:58.848 --> 02:17:59.008]  Good.
[02:17:59.028 --> 02:17:59.809]  You got a question for him?
[02:17:59.829 --> 02:18:01.469]  Yeah, I do.
[02:18:02.470 --> 02:18:07.232]  I'm an electronics technician and I just love what you guys are talking about today.
[02:18:07.272 --> 02:18:11.854]  I've always been interested in physics and quantum physics and stuff like that.
[02:18:11.914 --> 02:18:17.957]  But anyway, the question I had was, does harp use a particular frequency?
[02:18:18.928 --> 02:18:36.868]  Yeah, it does, and it's in the high frequency range, but it covers, because you have the technical background, you can manipulate the primary signal and create a secondary effect, which actually gives you the range of 16 decades of frequency, which covers everything from ultra-low to visible light.
[02:18:37.028 --> 02:18:38.010]  Is that the modulation?
[02:18:38.470 --> 02:18:46.038]  Yes, this is by modulating it or pulsing the signal to create varying effects and the coupling with the ionosphere to utilize it for creating effects.
[02:18:46.378 --> 02:18:48.701]  But it's essentially a high-frequency transmitter.
[02:18:48.981 --> 02:18:52.965]  You can go to the official HAARP website and get the specific frequency.
[02:18:52.985 --> 02:18:54.347]  I don't have it right in front of me, but...
[02:18:54.947 --> 02:18:59.929]  Again, it's the narrow band of high frequency that's used then to create this larger effect.
[02:18:59.969 --> 02:19:05.591]  Going back to that question, I never had time to jam in, and then we'll get another quick one and go to break and come back with other callers.
[02:19:06.031 --> 02:19:09.392]  But why are so many of these towers near the poles?
[02:19:09.492 --> 02:19:10.972]  I mean, is it easier to manipulate there?
[02:19:11.492 --> 02:19:18.935]  Well, you want to be close to where the magnetic field lines intersect the Earth, which is at the poles, and you also need a high available source of energy.
[02:19:19.582 --> 02:19:24.043]  Of course, in Alaska we have the oil and gas fields of the North Slope.
[02:19:24.523 --> 02:19:27.984]  25% of all the undiscovered oil in the world is in the Arctic.
[02:19:28.505 --> 02:19:29.365]  And so that's important.
[02:19:29.385 --> 02:19:32.206]  But the magnetic field line locations is the critical element.
[02:19:32.246 --> 02:19:37.027]  The closer they are to the ground, the easier it is to inject energy into them, much more efficient.
[02:19:38.331 --> 02:19:44.075]  Is there any evidence they're actually sucking some type of energy source out of the polar vortex?
[02:19:44.596 --> 02:19:47.918]  Well, that's a question that has not been adequately answered.
[02:19:47.958 --> 02:19:57.445]  There's really a question of whether they can tap energy out of the ionosphere, which is... Yeah, because you have those magnetic fields, correct, coming in at that point into the atmosphere and into the pole.
[02:19:57.685 --> 02:19:58.846]  We'll be right back with more calls.
[02:19:58.866 --> 02:19:59.647]  Great question, John.
[02:20:00.523 --> 02:20:04.766]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:20:05.067 --> 02:20:05.347]  Number 1.
[02:20:05.987 --> 02:20:09.130]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:20:09.410 --> 02:20:09.970]  Number 2.
[02:20:10.271 --> 02:20:14.814]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:20:15.174 --> 02:20:15.595]  It's true.
[02:20:15.915 --> 02:20:20.478]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:20:20.779 --> 02:20:21.319]  Number 3.
[02:20:21.599 --> 02:20:24.902]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:20:25.202 --> 02:20:28.885]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:20:29.085 --> 02:20:29.645]  Number 4.
[02:20:29.886 --> 02:20:32.247]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:20:32.648 --> 02:20:36.030]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:20:36.330 --> 02:20:36.550]  Number 5.
[02:20:37.111 --> 02:20:41.033]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:20:41.274 --> 02:20:46.017]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:20:46.317 --> 02:20:50.340]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:20:50.480 --> 02:20:52.062]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:20:52.262 --> 02:20:54.383]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:20:54.523 --> 02:20:56.805]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:20:56.865 --> 02:20:57.165]  Good day.
[02:20:57.266 --> 02:20:58.627]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[02:20:58.687 --> 02:20:59.027]  January 5th, 2011.
[02:20:59.087 --> 02:21:00.448]  Gold opened this morning at $1,380.
[02:21:00.488 --> 02:21:01.749]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $1,415.76.
[02:21:10.776 --> 02:21:11.177]  That's 1415.76, 707.88 or 353.94.
[02:21:19.801 --> 02:21:23.583]  Again, the Congressional Budget Office sounds the alarm, warning of Greek-style U.S.
[02:21:23.643 --> 02:21:24.443]  debt crises.
[02:21:24.803 --> 02:21:26.904]  CBO is drawing a parallel between U.S.
[02:21:26.964 --> 02:21:29.085]  economy and the Greek economic meltdown.
[02:21:29.405 --> 02:21:34.427]  Debt to GDP climbing to unfamiliar territory and deficits rising to unsupportable levels.
[02:21:34.747 --> 02:21:35.728]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[02:21:35.748 --> 02:21:41.470]  The Federal Debt and Risk of Financial Crises document the CBO has published is a must-read for every American.
[02:21:41.690 --> 02:21:47.515]  Covering the risks of deficit spending, aging population, and rising interest rates spells economic disaster.
[02:21:47.856 --> 02:21:48.496]  Call today at 800-686-2237.
[02:21:48.516 --> 02:21:49.217]  I'll send it free.
[02:21:49.237 --> 02:21:49.877]  Again, call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:49.957 --> 02:21:50.998]  Ask for the CBO document.
[02:21:51.018 --> 02:21:51.238]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:01.391 --> 02:22:04.995]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:22:05.415 --> 02:22:08.419]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:22:08.659 --> 02:22:13.444]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:22:13.464 --> 02:22:19.711]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:22:19.851 --> 02:22:22.094]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:22:22.594 --> 02:22:24.015]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:22:24.035 --> 02:22:24.855]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:22:25.195 --> 02:22:27.616]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:22:41.502 --> 02:22:43.344]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:22:43.364 --> 02:22:48.470]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:22:48.790 --> 02:22:57.920]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:22:59.562 --> 02:22:59.902]  Hello!
[02:23:00.242 --> 02:23:04.644]  At OfTheField.com, we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.
[02:23:04.984 --> 02:23:09.485]  We get lots of amazing positive feedback, most of which we feature on OfTheField.com.
[02:23:09.805 --> 02:23:14.587]  Here's a small sample of all that people like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[02:23:14.947 --> 02:23:18.868]  It's inspiring for many who are affected by the recent downturn of the economy.
[02:23:19.028 --> 02:23:22.968]  I already knew a bit about foraging and edibles, but you take it to a whole new level.
[02:23:23.068 --> 02:23:25.609]  A thousand thanks to you for all that great knowledge.
[02:23:25.869 --> 02:23:26.789]  It was empowering.
[02:23:26.909 --> 02:23:30.790]  When I was in the Navy, I went through a couple of quick land survival classes.
[02:23:30.890 --> 02:23:33.690]  Thank you for being an inspiration and for all the work that you do.
[02:23:33.710 --> 02:23:36.451]  I really appreciate the depth and detail of the information.
[02:23:36.571 --> 02:23:37.391]  Thank you so much.
[02:23:37.551 --> 02:23:40.331]  Much love and respect to you from all of us here in the boonies.
[02:23:40.411 --> 02:23:40.971]  Thanks again.
[02:23:41.151 --> 02:23:43.772]  Knowledge is power, and that power brings peace.
[02:23:44.525 --> 02:23:47.528]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.
[02:23:47.948 --> 02:23:51.312]  Read all of the testimonials at ofthefield.com.
[02:23:51.532 --> 02:23:55.536]  You can order online for you and your loved ones, or call 1-888-51-EAT-FREE to share in the secret.
[02:24:01.553 --> 02:24:04.274]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:24:04.875 --> 02:24:08.196]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:24:08.937 --> 02:24:11.818]  There's been big developments on that top Bush aide.
[02:24:12.298 --> 02:24:13.519]  Looks like mind control.
[02:24:14.059 --> 02:24:15.680]  Incredible developments on that front.
[02:24:15.720 --> 02:24:17.141]  The guy found dead in the landfill.
[02:24:17.161 --> 02:24:18.261]  That's coming up in the next segment.
[02:24:18.561 --> 02:24:20.322]  Only got five minutes left with Dr. Begich.
[02:24:20.382 --> 02:24:23.664]  I've hogged him for myself, but we're going to your calls with quick questions.
[02:24:24.364 --> 02:24:25.465]  Who's up next here, John?
[02:24:27.105 --> 02:24:28.206]  Mark in Minnesota.
[02:24:28.246 --> 02:24:29.967]  Quick question or comment for Dr. Begich.
[02:24:31.631 --> 02:24:32.592]  Uh, yes, Doctor.
[02:24:32.612 --> 02:24:52.784]  I was wondering your take on, I don't know, I didn't catch the whole show here, so I don't know if you've covered this, but I was wondering about the Gulf oil spill and if some of the toxins could be coming out of the Gulf and coming onshore and developing some kind of a cloud of gas or toxins and killing the birds and animals down there.
[02:24:54.025 --> 02:24:55.105]  That's a good question, Doc.
[02:24:55.185 --> 02:24:56.186]  That's a great question.
[02:24:56.306 --> 02:24:59.188]  I don't have any specific information on that and I've not
[02:25:00.188 --> 02:25:07.431]  I've not seen anything on that, but you know, we did see a huge release of toxic material there, similar to what we had at the Valdez-Exxon spill.
[02:25:08.031 --> 02:25:11.292]  But we didn't see those kinds of effects associated with our spill here.
[02:25:12.513 --> 02:25:13.213]  So it's hard to say.
[02:25:13.253 --> 02:25:21.337]  I think the judge is out on that, but it's certainly a good issue to raise because it did bring in a lot of toxins that weren't in the environment before.
[02:25:21.577 --> 02:25:25.538]  Well, we know when they say all the seafood's safe, the tests have shown it's not.
[02:25:25.558 --> 02:25:26.499]  They've been lying about that.
[02:25:26.559 --> 02:25:27.799]  Mark, great question.
[02:25:27.839 --> 02:25:29.560]  Bill in Florida, you're on the air with Dr. Nick Maggots.
[02:25:31.212 --> 02:25:31.973]  Hi, Alex.
[02:25:31.993 --> 02:25:34.795]  I've got a question.
[02:25:34.855 --> 02:25:39.440]  How do I protect myself against a cell phone tower that is 200 yards away?
[02:25:41.782 --> 02:25:44.204]  There's not a lot you can actually do.
[02:25:44.384 --> 02:25:50.170]  I mean, short of creating a Faraday cage and shunting the energy away from you, and that's not a practical solution.
[02:25:51.014 --> 02:25:57.502]  I can tell you up to 1500 meters cell towers have a biological effect that was documented years ago.
[02:25:57.522 --> 02:26:01.848]  I lectured with one of the scientists in Switzerland some years ago on this same subject.
[02:26:02.469 --> 02:26:08.873]  And that's the range is 1500 meters, which is quite a bit further out than you are.
[02:26:09.753 --> 02:26:12.615]  The greater effect is with young children or developing children.
[02:26:12.935 --> 02:26:14.676]  They tend to be more affected by this.
[02:26:14.696 --> 02:26:20.400]  If you remember the old EPA studies, power lines, when they involved children, they showed all kinds of negative effects.
[02:26:20.820 --> 02:26:23.621]  So they redid the studies with just adults and showed no effects.
[02:26:24.822 --> 02:26:25.563]  That's important.
[02:26:26.795 --> 02:26:33.837]  The only real solution is reconsideration of your location, if you feel it's affecting your health in a deleterious way.
[02:26:33.937 --> 02:26:37.898]  And we see this across the spectrum with fluoride, many times worse for children.
[02:26:38.179 --> 02:26:40.059]  It's radiation, many times worse.
[02:26:40.099 --> 02:26:44.861]  I guess it's something to do with the fast-growing, fast-dividing cells.
[02:26:45.361 --> 02:26:50.222]  We know that radiation in adults targets the gums, the intestines, fast-growing cells.
[02:26:50.422 --> 02:26:52.343]  With a child, the whole thing's fast-growing.
[02:26:52.523 --> 02:26:53.524]  That's exactly it.
[02:26:53.884 --> 02:27:04.149]  And then for other technologies like cell phones, where you're placing them against your head, the skull's thickness is half at age five of an adult, or less than half.
[02:27:04.189 --> 02:27:07.231]  So you have a lot more energy transiting into the brain.
[02:27:07.371 --> 02:27:16.956]  So there's lots of physical characteristics with children that affect them much differently than adults, particularly when you're considering these new forces of concern.
[02:27:17.236 --> 02:27:18.157]  Good question, Bill.
[02:27:18.237 --> 02:27:19.317]  Donna in Louisiana.
[02:27:19.337 --> 02:27:20.578]  You're on the air worldwide.
[02:27:21.789 --> 02:27:22.990]  Yes, hello, Alex?
[02:27:23.210 --> 02:27:23.450]  Yes.
[02:27:24.050 --> 02:27:26.792]  Okay, nice to talk to you.
[02:27:27.572 --> 02:27:30.514]  Thank you for all you do, and thank you, Dr. Begich, as well.
[02:27:31.734 --> 02:27:36.217]  I was wondering about empathy genes, pertinent to what you were talking about earlier.
[02:27:37.357 --> 02:27:45.182]  They did some studies several years ago, I don't know, five, ten years ago, I remember, wondering why, at the time, they were interested in such a thing.
[02:27:45.902 --> 02:27:51.285]  But this may play into some of your discussion about mind control and fear and
[02:27:52.188 --> 02:27:57.011]  Um, the empathy that we have that they're trying to suppress or something.
[02:27:57.031 --> 02:28:01.554]  We know the Pentagon has been working on turning off empathy to have kind of biological android.
[02:28:01.574 --> 02:28:06.877]  I mean, who needs a Terminator machine when you've got a human that's had their thinking process turned off.
[02:28:06.897 --> 02:28:07.418]  Dr. Begich?
[02:28:07.658 --> 02:28:08.478]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:28:08.498 --> 02:28:14.102]  In fact, there's a lot of work being done now because of post-traumatic stress syndrome of wiping out memory.
[02:28:14.302 --> 02:28:18.024]  Now, I would be very concerned about this because of several reasons.
[02:28:18.245 --> 02:28:18.525]  One is
[02:28:18.905 --> 02:28:19.326]  I'm not sure.
[02:28:31.815 --> 02:28:49.562]  What if all those troops were involved in some illegal, immoral, unethical, evil activity that normal human beings wouldn't participate in, which is why they're experiencing post-traumatic stress syndrome, and that what you're trying to do is wipe out their memory so you can deny that whatever they saw or participated in never happened?
[02:28:50.142 --> 02:28:50.402]  That's...
[02:28:51.611 --> 02:28:52.091]  That's my concern.
[02:28:52.111 --> 02:28:52.492]  Well, that's right.
[02:28:52.552 --> 02:29:02.696]  Studies show that people don't get very depressed when they see killing as something that was in defense or righteous, but your body, your brain actually attacks you if it thinks you've done bad.
[02:29:02.796 --> 02:29:06.438]  Even if you've rationalized consciously, your subconscious wants to kill you.
[02:29:06.758 --> 02:29:11.900]  Yeah, and it's, you know, I think we're playing in an area that is very, very dangerous.
[02:29:11.980 --> 02:29:18.043]  You know, trying to wipe out a memory rather than deal with what it is that has changed a person.
[02:29:19.116 --> 02:29:27.962]  You know, we do the same thing within this country every day with chemicals issued by doctors instead of people sitting down with counselors getting to the root of their problems.
[02:29:28.342 --> 02:29:31.884]  Now we want to just wipe out the memory so we can excuse bad behavior.
[02:29:32.345 --> 02:29:33.425]  I don't think it's a good idea.
[02:29:33.546 --> 02:29:36.027]  Doc, I won't keep you any longer after the break.
[02:29:36.227 --> 02:29:38.269]  We'll just do two minutes and plug Earth Pulse.
[02:29:39.029 --> 02:29:42.010]  Uh, and, uh, your work and how folks can support it, and we'll let you go.
[02:29:42.030 --> 02:29:44.571]  Then I'll get into all the big news, folks, and more of your calls.
[02:29:44.611 --> 02:29:45.071]  Stay with us.
[02:29:45.111 --> 02:29:45.791]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:45.851 --> 02:29:48.032]  InfoWars.com and their side, of course.
[02:29:48.052 --> 02:29:49.292]  We'll give you on the other side this break.
[02:29:50.913 --> 02:29:51.813]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.313 --> 02:29:53.914]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.834 --> 02:29:57.535]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.543 --> 02:30:04.766]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:30:05.087 --> 02:30:05.687]  Number 1.
[02:30:06.007 --> 02:30:09.150]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:09.430 --> 02:30:09.990]  Number 2.
[02:30:10.291 --> 02:30:14.834]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:30:15.174 --> 02:30:15.615]  It's true.
[02:30:15.915 --> 02:30:20.478]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:30:20.799 --> 02:30:21.339]  Number 3.
[02:30:21.619 --> 02:30:24.902]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:30:25.202 --> 02:30:28.905]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:29.105 --> 02:30:29.645]  Number 4.
[02:30:29.906 --> 02:30:32.267]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:30:32.668 --> 02:30:36.030]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:30:36.350 --> 02:30:36.550]  Number 5.
[02:30:37.131 --> 02:30:41.053]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:30:41.274 --> 02:30:46.037]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:30:46.317 --> 02:30:50.342]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:50.502 --> 02:30:52.064]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:52.284 --> 02:30:54.367]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:30:54.547 --> 02:30:56.890]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:31:01.696 --> 02:31:05.317]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:31:05.717 --> 02:31:08.718]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:31:08.938 --> 02:31:13.719]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:31:13.739 --> 02:31:19.980]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:31:20.140 --> 02:31:22.361]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:31:22.921 --> 02:31:23.201]  Tim Geithner?
[02:31:23.221 --> 02:31:23.641]  Bernanke?
[02:31:23.741 --> 02:31:24.342]  They're arsonists!
[02:31:24.402 --> 02:31:25.182]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:31:25.502 --> 02:31:27.923]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:31:41.809 --> 02:31:43.670]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:31:43.950 --> 02:31:48.693]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:31:49.094 --> 02:31:58.219]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:32:02.145 --> 02:32:05.768]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:32:06.108 --> 02:32:14.234]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:32:14.975 --> 02:32:19.018]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:32:19.618 --> 02:32:30.427]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:32:31.047 --> 02:32:40.070]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:32:40.570 --> 02:32:45.612]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:32:45.992 --> 02:32:53.175]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:32:53.475 --> 02:32:56.236]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:33:03.359 --> 02:33:08.922]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[02:33:09.362 --> 02:33:12.003]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:12.023 --> 02:33:14.665]  We're going to let Dr. Baggage go.
[02:33:14.765 --> 02:33:17.046]  I've got a huge news blitz that I must cover.
[02:33:17.086 --> 02:33:19.267]  I promised myself this morning I would get to at least
[02:33:19.847 --> 02:33:21.028]  You know, the headlines here.
[02:33:21.048 --> 02:33:21.949]  I've gotten some of it.
[02:33:21.969 --> 02:33:24.871]  But Dr. Begich, we're going to have you back very soon.
[02:33:24.891 --> 02:33:27.133]  You know, I blink my eyes and a year goes by.
[02:33:27.173 --> 02:33:28.774]  We hadn't had you on in about a year and a half.
[02:33:29.174 --> 02:33:31.816]  He's back with us here today.
[02:33:32.537 --> 02:33:34.778]  But there's a lot of different sites folks can visit.
[02:33:34.818 --> 02:33:36.300]  We sell your books and videos.
[02:33:36.320 --> 02:33:38.381]  People can get them at earthpulse.com.
[02:33:38.661 --> 02:33:42.104]  What are some of the other sites people can visit to find out about the exciting stuff you're doing?
[02:33:42.324 --> 02:33:46.146]  Well, you know, the Earth Pulse site has, you know, a lot of articles and information.
[02:33:46.186 --> 02:33:48.768]  A lot of free information, incidentally, is there as well.
[02:33:48.808 --> 02:33:52.750]  But, you know, if people want our books and videos, go to infoware.com.
[02:33:52.770 --> 02:33:55.951]  Support Alex's work and mine by doing that, and I appreciate it.
[02:33:56.512 --> 02:34:04.696]  The other thing I can say is, and I mean this sincerely, I really appreciate the prayers I get from listeners.
[02:34:05.496 --> 02:34:06.997]  And I don't want to understate that.
[02:34:07.237 --> 02:34:09.999]  I need that every day, and I appreciate it.
[02:34:10.936 --> 02:34:19.563]  Same here and that's what I really want is people's love and their prayers and I want everybody to know my love and prayers are going right back out at you.
[02:34:20.084 --> 02:34:27.951]  Well and I appreciate it and more than more than anyone will ever know and there's a lot left to do and I look forward to this year.
[02:34:28.011 --> 02:34:36.698]  What's coming in this year and what's coming in the future is liberation and liberty again in our individual lives and hopefully in the
[02:34:37.383 --> 02:34:39.705]  Well, that's why the system is so scared in closing.
[02:34:39.765 --> 02:34:41.987]  They can feel and see what we feel and see.
[02:34:42.227 --> 02:34:43.368]  That's absolutely it.
[02:34:43.928 --> 02:34:45.189]  And we are the force.
[02:34:45.570 --> 02:34:47.832]  We were created to be good stewards of this planet.
[02:34:47.852 --> 02:34:49.693]  We were created to lift each other up.
[02:34:50.434 --> 02:34:56.699]  That is our obligation to the creation itself and to ourselves and to our next generation.
[02:34:56.939 --> 02:35:00.882]  I look forward to the work that's before us and the challenges.
[02:35:00.942 --> 02:35:02.564]  At the same time, know that we don't walk
[02:35:03.186 --> 02:35:03.526]  Alone.
[02:35:03.626 --> 02:35:09.408]  We all walk with friends, and we'll continue to meet each other as life takes us down our trail.
[02:35:10.749 --> 02:35:12.109]  God bless you, Dr. Nick Baggage.
[02:35:12.129 --> 02:35:13.930]  We look forward to speaking to you again in the near future.
[02:35:13.990 --> 02:35:15.431]  God bless you and your listening audience.
[02:35:15.531 --> 02:35:16.051]  Take care now.
[02:35:16.371 --> 02:35:17.832]  Alright, amazing talking to him.
[02:35:17.872 --> 02:35:30.596]  He's, the last few years, really not been doing anything, and now he is back and not even recharged, just more informative and insightful than ever.
[02:35:31.116 --> 02:35:31.897]  And everybody
[02:35:32.657 --> 02:35:40.283]  Either people are giving in more to evil and corruption and getting more into that, or they're getting more into freedom and liberty.
[02:35:40.403 --> 02:35:42.264]  And I can just feel it every day.
[02:35:42.324 --> 02:35:43.545]  I can hardly contain myself.
[02:35:44.726 --> 02:35:48.528]  But then it's also very frustrating to see all the corruption and bad things growing as well.
[02:35:50.149 --> 02:35:57.714]  And I don't even so much get angry as I just get motivated to sweep these people aside.
[02:35:57.794 --> 02:36:06.940]  Because I can just see them, I can tell you they're weak, I know they're bad, and it's because we haven't stepped into who we really are that they've been able to get away with this.
[02:36:07.060 --> 02:36:07.960]  It is a joke.
[02:36:09.541 --> 02:36:10.422]  It is a joke.
[02:36:10.442 --> 02:36:12.803]  It's like watching an ant whip an elephant.
[02:36:13.524 --> 02:36:16.806]  And that is absolutely backwards.
[02:36:17.867 --> 02:36:18.127]  Okay.
[02:36:19.534 --> 02:36:27.157]  When I see stories like this, it makes my mind, as I said in the first hour, explode in a thousand fractals of understanding.
[02:36:28.777 --> 02:36:29.878]  It's like a shake and bake.
[02:36:30.298 --> 02:36:34.459]  It's like box-made brownies or biscuits.
[02:36:35.520 --> 02:36:39.121]  I mean, all you do is add milk.
[02:36:39.741 --> 02:36:41.882]  It's a pre-packaged tropism.
[02:36:43.297 --> 02:36:44.618]  It's always done the same.
[02:36:45.078 --> 02:36:46.879]  How do we know different terrorists staged?
[02:36:46.939 --> 02:36:47.539]  We look at it.
[02:36:48.459 --> 02:36:50.140]  It has all the same characteristics.
[02:36:50.200 --> 02:36:57.003]  The patsies, the people being protected, the shut-ups, the giving them the passports, their boss being Pentagon run.
[02:36:58.984 --> 02:37:04.546]  And when I saw the bombing in Egypt,
[02:37:05.583 --> 02:37:09.345]  Over the weekend, I was, I was, please let it be real Muslim terrorists.
[02:37:09.405 --> 02:37:10.606]  Please, please.
[02:37:11.026 --> 02:37:15.789]  That's much less scary in my gut than knowing the government's doing it.
[02:37:15.910 --> 02:37:17.971]  Please, please, please, please.
[02:37:18.591 --> 02:37:20.853]  Please let 9-1-1 be the way they say it is.
[02:37:21.113 --> 02:37:21.653]  But it isn't.
[02:37:22.414 --> 02:37:23.714]  And it's always the same story.
[02:37:23.754 --> 02:37:24.775]  They were being protected.
[02:37:25.195 --> 02:37:26.916]  The police had folks evacuate.
[02:37:27.237 --> 02:37:28.557]  There was inside knowledge.
[02:37:28.637 --> 02:37:30.218]  Government intelligence was involved.
[02:37:30.679 --> 02:37:31.699]  It's always the same.
[02:37:32.480 --> 02:37:33.981]  They're going to use it as a crackdown measure.
[02:37:35.657 --> 02:37:44.824]  I mean, you think I'm happy that Anwar al-Awlaki, one of the top al-Qaeda people, is admittedly a Pentagon secret asset and running the attacks?
[02:37:47.045 --> 02:37:51.929]  I mean, I'm not concerned about a bunch of ragtag idiots running around in the desert.
[02:37:53.110 --> 02:37:55.932]  Ragtag idiots can't pull off 9-11, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:37:55.972 --> 02:37:57.113]  They didn't, okay?
[02:37:57.993 --> 02:37:58.874]  And it's the same thing.
[02:37:59.114 --> 02:38:03.798]  This top Pentagon aide to Bush, senior,
[02:38:05.100 --> 02:38:05.681]  I don't think so.
[02:38:25.393 --> 02:38:29.516]  Now, in Fannie Malick fame, the Arkansas Medical Examiner, they killed people.
[02:38:30.797 --> 02:38:32.638]  That is, someone in the government killed people.
[02:38:32.939 --> 02:38:37.022]  And then Fannie Malick would declare it suicide when they'd been shot, arms and legs cut off.
[02:38:37.442 --> 02:38:38.563]  I mean, ridiculous stuff, okay?
[02:38:38.603 --> 02:38:43.867]  It'd be like saying I cut my own arms and legs off and then put myself in a trunk and threw it in the Atlantic Ocean.
[02:38:44.327 --> 02:38:45.028]  It's impossible.
[02:38:46.449 --> 02:38:50.152]  But, a few days ago we learned he's dead.
[02:38:51.052 --> 02:38:51.853]  Dead in a landfill.
[02:38:54.438 --> 02:38:57.961]  And now they want to imply that he was a bad guy.
[02:38:59.442 --> 02:39:03.426]  Showing that he must have gotten some information out to the media or somebody.
[02:39:03.926 --> 02:39:05.628]  And now they want to discredit him.
[02:39:05.648 --> 02:39:14.735]  Now they want to discredit him ahead of that info coming out.
[02:39:16.477 --> 02:39:17.938]  Now, now, get ready for this.
[02:39:17.978 --> 02:39:21.461]  This has drugged up mind control written all over it.
[02:39:22.892 --> 02:39:24.013]  That's what it has written all over it.
[02:39:24.633 --> 02:39:27.596]  Or something similar.
[02:39:27.976 --> 02:39:29.797]  Because it's always the same MO.
[02:39:29.817 --> 02:39:31.038]  They always do stuff like this.
[02:39:31.499 --> 02:39:40.205]  Disoriented and wearing just one shoe, bizarre last sighting of top White House aide found murdered and dumped in a landfill.
[02:39:42.627 --> 02:39:51.594]  Top Pentagon aide found dead at a landfill site, was seen in confused state 48 hours before his death, wandering around the car park and wearing only one shoe.
[02:39:53.206 --> 02:40:00.090]  John Wheeler was disoriented and not wearing a coat despite the freezing temperature, according to the car park attendant in Wilmington, Delaware.
[02:40:00.571 --> 02:40:03.272]  Asked if he felt okay, the 66-year-old simply replied, no.
[02:40:05.373 --> 02:40:15.219]  The following day, he was also seen wandering around the town in the last sighting before his body was discovered, dumped into the landfill.
[02:40:15.319 --> 02:40:17.481]  Now, it gets even more insane.
[02:40:18.021 --> 02:40:18.922]  This is out today.
[02:40:20.100 --> 02:40:23.374]  the fifth of january twenty eleven here's the next one
[02:40:24.355 --> 02:40:34.797]  Man found in landfill, tied to arson attempt, John P. Wheeler III, planted incendiary devices at neighbor's home in Delaware days before his disappearance.
[02:40:35.537 --> 02:40:37.097]  And this is from the Delaware Police.
[02:40:37.117 --> 02:40:39.418]  Do you believe any of this?
[02:40:39.818 --> 02:40:45.299]  I mean, I hope they don't find yours truly dead in a landfill sometime and then claim I put bombs in my neighbor's house.
[02:40:45.679 --> 02:40:46.779]  Now he's a terrorist?
[02:40:47.359 --> 02:40:48.559]  Do you really believe this?
[02:40:48.799 --> 02:40:50.039]  Now he's Al Qaeda!
[02:40:50.719 --> 02:40:53.100]  What do I go to Walmart and report him to Big Sis?
[02:40:54.684 --> 02:41:06.411]  Police found evidence linking John P. Parsons, Wheeler III, to devices planted at the Newcastle home of a neighbor with whom he had been feuding, said the source, who was close to the investigation.
[02:41:06.691 --> 02:41:10.974]  And then on top of it, he's running around drooling in the freezing temperature with one shoe.
[02:41:10.994 --> 02:41:14.896]  They got him, drugged him up, threw him back out of the car.
[02:41:15.517 --> 02:41:17.518]  And then somebody else said, just go ahead and kill that guy.
[02:41:18.399 --> 02:41:23.121]  The feud was over the size of the neighbor's house, which was under construction in the city's historic district.
[02:41:23.161 --> 02:41:23.702]  Yeah, I bet.
[02:41:25.057 --> 02:41:26.578]  I mean, who writes this stuff?
[02:41:27.198 --> 02:41:28.199]  Who makes this stuff up?
[02:41:28.499 --> 02:41:33.662]  Now it'll all be about him being an arsonist instead of who killed him and threw him in a stinking landfill.
[02:41:34.462 --> 02:41:38.445]  And now they're showing surveillance footage of him wandering around.
[02:41:40.025 --> 02:41:47.310]  The source emphasized that the evidence does not shed light on the murder itself, but has helped detectives understand Wheeler's state of mind before he disappeared.
[02:41:47.590 --> 02:41:48.270]  Yeah, sure.
[02:41:48.730 --> 02:41:53.053]  Boy, the detectives are just absolutely sure that he planted a bomb.
[02:41:55.438 --> 02:41:56.678]  I mean, this is ridiculous!
[02:41:59.379 --> 02:42:02.240]  This is fogging up, you know, the whole discussion.
[02:42:03.981 --> 02:42:12.004]  Wheeler was found dead in a landfill on Friday and the police are trying to retrace his movements between December 28th and then.
[02:42:12.024 --> 02:42:14.965]  That's good with the video, guys.
[02:42:15.005 --> 02:42:15.265]  Thanks.
[02:42:17.306 --> 02:42:18.166]  Continuing here.
[02:42:19.622 --> 02:42:21.043]  The case is drawn national attention.
[02:42:21.103 --> 02:42:28.949]  Newark police received roughly 70 media calls Tuesday because Wheeler 66 lived such a distinguished public life.
[02:42:29.810 --> 02:42:35.735]  Oh, he was so distinguished until he wasn't wearing a shoe or a coat outside and was acting crazy.
[02:42:39.257 --> 02:42:41.499]  Guy running for his life probably is what happened.
[02:42:41.519 --> 02:42:42.940]  And boy, they got him.
[02:42:43.581 --> 02:42:45.943]  And to make sure everybody knows Mr. Wheeler's a bad man,
[02:42:47.458 --> 02:42:49.860]  Involved in all the key Pentagon operations.
[02:42:50.521 --> 02:42:52.663]  Why would he plant those bombs?
[02:42:53.223 --> 02:42:55.865]  Or maybe he was mind control the whole time and blew a gasket.
[02:42:55.925 --> 02:42:56.586]  You don't know.
[02:42:57.207 --> 02:42:58.528]  You don't know with these people.
[02:42:58.568 --> 02:43:00.069]  The sky is the limit.
[02:43:00.950 --> 02:43:03.892]  But it's got black ops written all over it.
[02:43:05.274 --> 02:43:06.715]  People are like, oh, that's a conspiracy theory.
[02:43:08.136 --> 02:43:09.317]  Where else does it go?
[02:43:09.637 --> 02:43:10.798]  Where else does it point?
[02:43:11.721 --> 02:43:13.542]  Running around like he's out of his mind?
[02:43:13.982 --> 02:43:16.164]  Not wearing a shoe in freezing arctic weather?
[02:43:16.544 --> 02:43:17.184]  For days?
[02:43:18.505 --> 02:43:19.906]  Bombs at people's houses?
[02:43:21.727 --> 02:43:23.388]  Bush aid found in a landfill?
[02:43:23.408 --> 02:43:32.274]  I remember having the DC Madam on a few months before she was killed.
[02:43:33.635 --> 02:43:48.700]  And I told her, I said, if you know more stuff about the Johns that your women were seeing, top brass, White House, you name it, is reportedly what was in there, you better tell people right now.
[02:43:49.840 --> 02:43:52.021]  And she's like, no, I'm gonna hold on to all of that.
[02:43:52.141 --> 02:43:59.163]  And then I called her landlord at the condo she owned, and she wasn't gonna kill herself.
[02:43:59.203 --> 02:44:00.363]  She said she was being followed.
[02:44:00.683 --> 02:44:02.384]  She was going to hide the stuff with her mommy.
[02:44:03.752 --> 02:44:05.094]  And they hung her in the garage.
[02:44:06.876 --> 02:44:10.640]  It didn't matter if I had audio tapes of her live on air saying she'd ever kill herself.
[02:44:11.841 --> 02:44:15.926]  Old friends went on the news with no evidence that said that she said she was going to kill herself.
[02:44:17.107 --> 02:44:17.227]  Mm-hmm.
[02:44:19.410 --> 02:44:19.670]  Mm-hmm.
[02:44:20.748 --> 02:44:23.270]  Let me tell you something, I will never commit suicide.
[02:44:23.570 --> 02:44:27.093]  Never, never, never, never, never.
[02:44:27.394 --> 02:44:33.098]  And anybody that pops up and says that I told him I was, that person's a stinking New World Order piece of trash.
[02:44:33.479 --> 02:44:35.921]  I want that on record right now.
[02:44:37.202 --> 02:44:37.542]  Okay?
[02:44:37.822 --> 02:44:38.503]  I love life.
[02:44:39.003 --> 02:44:40.565]  I've got total gusto for it.
[02:44:42.054 --> 02:44:42.534]  So much.
[02:44:42.614 --> 02:44:50.898]  I love life so much, I'm willing to put myself in the crosshairs for everybody, including my children, because people before me did it, so we'd have some basic dignity.
[02:44:53.399 --> 02:44:54.460]  I'm in love with life.
[02:44:54.540 --> 02:44:55.801]  I'm in love with creation.
[02:44:55.861 --> 02:44:57.261]  I'm in love with everything good.
[02:44:57.281 --> 02:44:59.582]  I know how to recognize what's wholesome.
[02:45:00.443 --> 02:45:02.644]  This new world order is the opposite of wholesome, and I don't like it.
[02:45:06.786 --> 02:45:07.266]  Oh, my God.
[02:45:09.309 --> 02:45:10.470]  All right, I said I'd get into the news.
[02:45:10.530 --> 02:45:10.970]  Here it is.
[02:45:11.971 --> 02:45:14.672]  This was pointed out by Jaron, who's been doing a bunch of research on it today.
[02:45:14.692 --> 02:45:17.214]  I've sent it over to the Watson brothers, and one of them chooses to do a story.
[02:45:18.235 --> 02:45:26.680]  Starlicide, or goal toxic, is a chemical that's used
[02:45:28.683 --> 02:45:33.367]  To kill European starlings and gulls, but less toxic to other birds and mammals.
[02:45:34.408 --> 02:45:51.422]  And it's got restricted use, and Jaron looked at 99, 2000, 2008, 2009, constant scandals with starlicide killing birds, and it's sprayed for some reason in December and January, dealing with soybeans, which are grown heavily in Arkansas.
[02:45:52.338 --> 02:45:53.118]  And surrounding areas.
[02:45:53.579 --> 02:46:01.944]  But the state could be covering up that it was used and saying, oh, they didn't die from any poison, but could starlicide liquefy their organs?
[02:46:02.444 --> 02:46:02.884]  I doubt it.
[02:46:03.284 --> 02:46:04.225]  It needs to be looked into.
[02:46:04.845 --> 02:46:10.068]  But something that Jaron dug up there, and that is important.
[02:46:10.108 --> 02:46:13.410]  We know they use restricted pesticides all the time without authorization.
[02:46:13.470 --> 02:46:19.534]  It would be the first time the state covered it up, because the states are caught all the time using restricted pesticides.
[02:46:22.924 --> 02:46:25.708]  Okay, let me just, look, there's only one way to get to all this news.
[02:46:25.748 --> 02:46:28.272]  I'll just go through it stack by stack because it's all out of control in here.
[02:46:28.652 --> 02:46:31.917]  Leaked document EPA knowingly approved bee-killing pesticide.
[02:46:32.418 --> 02:46:33.960]  That's confirmed by Natural News.
[02:46:35.525 --> 02:46:58.926]  And it goes to the fact that they knew that the pesticide Cloth-E-Anidine, Cloth-E-Anidine, would wipe out honeybees, but the EPA quietly gave authorization for it to be used nationwide and it's used in Europe, and those are the main zones where the honeybees are dying en masse, along with most species of bumblebee, which pollinate the plants, but corporations don't care.
[02:46:59.246 --> 02:47:01.969]  They'd rather tax your carbon dioxide that plants breathe instead of
[02:47:02.389 --> 02:47:03.509]  Caring about anything serious?
[02:47:03.829 --> 02:47:15.253]  Open air clones, open air cloned animals, toxic waste everywhere, chemical warfare, biological weapons, genetic engineering, mouse pox, flu shots everywhere, all these dangerous things, all these mutagens.
[02:47:15.693 --> 02:47:16.673]  Let's not worry about that.
[02:47:16.693 --> 02:47:21.875]  Let's worry about mother's milk to the earth, carbon dioxide, just absolute buffoonery.
[02:47:22.375 --> 02:47:25.976]  Get all the hippies worried about something that doesn't matter instead of all these real crises.
[02:47:27.316 --> 02:47:29.757]  Whatever they want to do, that's it.
[02:47:29.897 --> 02:47:33.479]  Mass bird and fish die-offs go global spark end times panic.
[02:47:34.059 --> 02:47:38.281]  Brazil, Sweden, New Zealand hit with strange phenomenon as speculation rages.
[02:47:38.321 --> 02:47:41.543]  Key article by Paul Joseph Watson boiling all of that down.
[02:47:42.783 --> 02:47:45.907]  Why are the animals dying, birds, fish wiped out, and mysterious deaths?
[02:47:46.287 --> 02:47:47.688]  Mike Adams got a good report on that.
[02:47:48.329 --> 02:47:52.834]  Victorian river up in Canada turns bright green.
[02:47:52.854 --> 02:47:53.614]  Very mysterious.
[02:47:53.634 --> 02:47:54.716]  Don't know what's going on with that.
[02:47:56.798 --> 02:48:01.002]  Humans have intentionally modified weather for military purposes and climate control for decades.
[02:48:01.282 --> 02:48:03.404]  So how do we know all this freak weather isn't caused by that?
[02:48:04.252 --> 02:48:06.093]  Or chain reactions from weather modification?
[02:48:06.133 --> 02:48:07.875]  The answer is a lot of it is caused by that.
[02:48:09.335 --> 02:48:14.699]  And we've seen a lot of floods and things in the past have been connected directly to Army testing and Navy testing.
[02:48:14.779 --> 02:48:19.022]  Right here where I live in Texas, it came out about 12 years ago on the San Antonio Express News.
[02:48:19.322 --> 02:48:20.423]  They caused a bunch of floods.
[02:48:21.624 --> 02:48:22.665]  So that continues.
[02:48:23.425 --> 02:48:24.366]  This is just one stack.
[02:48:24.386 --> 02:48:24.726]  I've got like 10.
[02:48:24.846 --> 02:48:25.847]  I'm never going to get to all this.
[02:48:27.568 --> 02:48:28.749]  So that's an important area.
[02:48:30.014 --> 02:48:30.914]  Here's another report.
[02:48:30.934 --> 02:48:32.195]  New York City blizzard.
[02:48:32.355 --> 02:48:37.216]  Feds open criminal probe into alleged city worker conspiracy during storm response.
[02:48:37.597 --> 02:48:41.818]  It's been confirmed that they had a union slowdown.
[02:48:42.258 --> 02:48:44.739]  You know, how do you do that when people are dying?
[02:48:45.119 --> 02:48:48.320]  Can't you have your protest some other time?
[02:48:50.441 --> 02:48:52.001]  It's just insane.
[02:48:53.062 --> 02:48:53.742]  Continuing.
[02:48:54.702 --> 02:48:56.683]  Oh no, not another Ice Age.
[02:48:57.243 --> 02:48:58.504]  Even Fox News covered this.
[02:49:00.410 --> 02:49:09.337]  A report here from IMVA about how incredibly accurate the predictions were of Piers Corbin.
[02:49:09.497 --> 02:49:10.999]  We had him on here early last year.
[02:49:11.279 --> 02:49:19.325]  He predicted exactly what happened, dealing with the solar winds and also magnetic effects of the Earth in relationship to moon cycles.
[02:49:19.846 --> 02:49:20.526]  Amazing!
[02:49:20.907 --> 02:49:23.909]  And there's a lot of reports about how devastatingly accurate he is.
[02:49:23.929 --> 02:49:24.910]  We're going to be getting him on.
[02:49:27.748 --> 02:49:35.873]  But the government's answer is, oh, this is global warming causing the coldest temperatures in 1,000 years in Europe and the United States and many other areas.
[02:49:36.453 --> 02:49:47.020]  Incredible article on Leningradian, the Tories are going to turn over the national parks of England completely for private sale and logging to pay off debts to foreign banks.
[02:49:47.440 --> 02:49:49.622]  Just like they're handing over the islands of Greece.
[02:49:51.083 --> 02:49:52.486]  To the foreign swindling banks.
[02:49:52.526 --> 02:49:53.147]  Same thing here.
[02:49:53.207 --> 02:49:53.848]  For sale.
[02:49:54.349 --> 02:49:55.330]  All of our forests.
[02:49:55.751 --> 02:49:57.133]  Not some of them.
[02:49:57.534 --> 02:49:58.436]  Nor most of them.
[02:49:58.516 --> 02:49:59.537]  The whole lot.
[02:50:01.112 --> 02:50:02.012]  So you gotta love that.
[02:50:02.032 --> 02:50:10.116]  Uh, hypocrite George Mambiad, who openly calls for world government, while simultaneously writing articles for major publications saying it doesn't exist.
[02:50:10.497 --> 02:50:11.977]  That's their total contempt for you.
[02:50:11.997 --> 02:50:14.058]  And as long as you're unknowledgeable, they can win.
[02:50:14.799 --> 02:50:18.901]  As soon as you're as smart about the New World Order as you are about football, you'll see what scum they are.
[02:50:19.081 --> 02:50:20.581]  They revel in you being ignorant!
[02:50:20.882 --> 02:50:21.802]  Get smart now!
[02:50:22.903 --> 02:50:24.103]  These people are easy to beat!
[02:50:24.363 --> 02:50:25.624]  You just haven't fought them yet!
[02:50:27.034 --> 02:50:32.879]  If some swollen redneck from Texas can decimate them like a 5,000 foot ogre, what can you do?
[02:50:34.601 --> 02:50:38.925]  Hypocrite George Monbiot condemns large, expansive homes.
[02:50:40.208 --> 02:50:47.771]  Except his own, just like Al Gore, just giant, lavish, 20,000 square feet, jet aircraft, Al Gore, Mombiot, the Prince of Wales.
[02:50:48.031 --> 02:50:55.654]  You shouldn't be able to take a hot bath, but they got scores of homes, just hypocritic, bloated scum, handing over the forest, sawing them down everywhere.
[02:50:55.674 --> 02:50:57.934]  But don't worry, a carbon tax will save you.
[02:50:58.234 --> 02:50:59.435]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[02:51:00.982 --> 02:51:01.943]  Go solar for cheap!
[02:51:02.163 --> 02:51:04.304]  Want to use solar power but the price is too high?
[02:51:04.624 --> 02:51:09.666]  Now you can build your own solar panels for less than $200 at 123cheapsolar.com.

[02:51:30.376 --> 02:51:39.662]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:51:39.702 --> 02:51:40.443]  This capitalism?
[02:51:40.503 --> 02:51:46.647]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:51:46.767 --> 02:51:47.588]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[02:51:47.648 --> 02:51:50.750]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[02:51:50.910 --> 02:51:51.670]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[02:51:51.690 --> 02:51:53.051]  It's time to understand the system.

[02:52:00.656 --> 02:52:02.957]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:52:03.038 --> 02:52:05.259]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:52:05.359 --> 02:52:08.140]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:52:08.561 --> 02:52:13.323]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:52:13.664 --> 02:52:17.866]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:18.186 --> 02:52:20.508]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:20.528 --> 02:52:23.049]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:52:23.409 --> 02:52:25.991]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:26.331 --> 02:52:33.936]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:34.269 --> 02:52:39.510]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:39.651 --> 02:52:42.451]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:42.511 --> 02:52:45.932]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:52:46.192 --> 02:52:47.113]  And I got news for you.
[02:52:47.253 --> 02:52:48.573]  You're everyone else.

[02:54:11.892 --> 02:54:15.354]  Folks, I'll be back tomorrow live, uh, 11 a.m.
[02:54:15.374 --> 02:54:16.054]  to 2 p.m.
[02:54:17.535 --> 02:54:18.776]  I'm sorry to all these callers.
[02:54:18.856 --> 02:54:20.317]  We got to most of you.
[02:54:20.757 --> 02:54:21.898]  We'll be back tomorrow live.
[02:54:23.143 --> 02:54:29.328]  And I've got to get to the satellites that they claim were to stop global warming, that were to analyze it.
[02:54:30.028 --> 02:54:33.771]  And now the WikiLeaks and the Germans have admitted it's true, working with the U.S.
[02:54:33.791 --> 02:54:34.192]  government.
[02:54:34.232 --> 02:54:36.874]  They're pure spy satellites, infrared.
[02:54:37.474 --> 02:54:46.221]  Now what they don't tell you is, the big secret weapon is, on the ground, they get an infrared scan of your body from passive cameras.
[02:54:47.725 --> 02:54:53.768]  They then attach it with a face scan integrated in that they already have from your digital photo and your passport or your driver's license.
[02:54:54.109 --> 02:54:55.489]  Now they have your heat resonance.
[02:54:56.530 --> 02:55:06.275]  Then they create a model of that from the top of your body and off your heat signature from your shoulders and the top of your head, they can identify you from space.
[02:55:07.616 --> 02:55:15.761]  And that's what this is really all about and that's the big secret weapon Bob Woodward talked about that he wouldn't tell you what it was over in Iraq.
[02:55:17.363 --> 02:55:20.797]  And they've also got other wavelength systems that send out...
[02:55:21.846 --> 02:55:22.406]  I think?
[02:55:52.086 --> 02:56:00.911]  Ventura confirmed that Homeland Security and others threatened Time Warner so they removed his show, the Police State episode, that breaks down the whole takeover plan.
[02:56:01.371 --> 02:56:02.612]  They hit a hole in one.
[02:56:03.272 --> 02:56:04.072]  We hit a hole in one.
[02:56:04.092 --> 02:56:05.313]  I was a big consultant on that.
[02:56:05.873 --> 02:56:15.038]  Very proud of that episode and that's why I freaked out when it actually aired and I called Ventura that night and congratulated him and I called them all and we talked about it and couldn't believe it got on air and then they took it off.
[02:56:15.538 --> 02:56:18.319]  They're now remotely erasing it off of DVRs.
[02:56:19.637 --> 02:56:20.877]  And it's confirmed they're doing it.
[02:56:22.038 --> 02:56:24.538]  And they're now starting to erase the JFK and Wall Street.
[02:56:25.279 --> 02:56:25.839]  And water.
[02:56:26.539 --> 02:56:27.799]  They do not want this scene.
[02:56:28.199 --> 02:56:37.322]  They're erasing it off YouTube as well, but we found some sites that do have it, and in pretty good quality, and it's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:56:38.222 --> 02:56:40.023]  This cost around 300 grand to make.
[02:56:40.763 --> 02:56:46.468]  It's a 45-minute show, and they are very upset about this, okay?
[02:56:46.768 --> 02:56:51.152]  This episode shows you the total martial law, the ten FEMA governors,
[02:56:52.523 --> 02:56:54.505]  This really upset Homeland Security.
[02:56:54.965 --> 02:56:58.288]  I mean, there were all sorts of things I can't talk about that went on with this.
[02:56:59.009 --> 02:57:01.612]  Men in black showing up, people being broke into.
[02:57:01.752 --> 02:57:02.693]  I'm just gonna leave it at that.
[02:57:03.153 --> 02:57:05.415]  In fact, I'm not even supposed to... I'm gonna shut up now.
[02:57:06.056 --> 02:57:07.097]  They're pretty freaked out.
[02:57:07.577 --> 02:57:09.259]  There probably won't even be a show next year.
[02:57:09.879 --> 02:57:10.340]  There you go.
[02:57:10.580 --> 02:57:11.841]  We wondered how it got on air.
[02:57:12.161 --> 02:57:12.362]  Well...
[02:57:13.953 --> 02:57:16.755]  Yeah, the eye of Sauron noticed it, and that's your free country.
[02:57:17.176 --> 02:57:20.319]  So if you want that video, you better get it and spread it out to everybody.
[02:57:20.819 --> 02:57:22.761]  Oh, I wanted to do the search today.
[02:57:22.981 --> 02:57:24.202]  I was going to do a search today.
[02:57:25.203 --> 02:57:28.386]  The only time we failed at doing this is when I do it at the end of the show.
[02:57:28.586 --> 02:57:31.568]  Everybody search and search and search again.
[02:57:32.979 --> 02:57:34.661]  Censored Jesse Ventura.
[02:57:35.401 --> 02:57:37.023]  Censored Jesse Ventura.

[02:57:41.446 --> 02:57:50.554]  Three words, put it in Google, Yahoo, hit them hard, hit them all, copy our article over, so that you can then have the traffic to your site.
[02:57:50.774 --> 02:57:52.996]  I don't care about the traffic, I care about the truth, okay?
[02:57:53.217 --> 02:57:54.197]  I'm far beyond driven.
[02:57:54.458 --> 02:57:56.579]  Point of no return was passed many years ago.
[02:57:56.960 --> 02:57:58.181]  It's about defeating the globalists.
[02:57:58.241 --> 02:57:58.801]  It's us or them.
[02:57:59.822 --> 02:58:01.323]  Censored Jesse Ventura.
[02:58:01.383 --> 02:58:01.983]  Three words.

[02:58:05.064 --> 02:58:05.945]  Censored Jesse Ventura.
[02:58:06.245 --> 02:58:07.786]  Please, we cannot fail.
[02:58:07.806 --> 02:58:11.087]  I meant to rant and rave about this today and tell you to get that video out.
[02:58:12.067 --> 02:58:14.749]  There doesn't need to be, you know, 100,000 views on this video.
[02:58:14.769 --> 02:58:15.949]  There needs to be 10 million.
[02:58:16.469 --> 02:58:17.530]  Get this video.
[02:58:18.050 --> 02:58:21.173]  And get it out to everyone now, now, now.
[02:58:21.673 --> 02:58:25.236]  Censor Jesse Ventura Show on FEMA Camps survives on YouTube.
[02:58:25.596 --> 02:58:29.119]  I will get into the whole police state control grid that I've been meaning to get to for days.
[02:58:29.539 --> 02:58:32.301]  It's so horrible that at a subconscious level I've not been covering it.
[02:58:32.582 --> 02:58:33.522]  I will cover that tomorrow.
[02:58:33.562 --> 02:58:36.145]  More powerful guests this week and next week.
[02:58:36.185 --> 02:58:37.125]  Great job with the crew.
[02:58:37.446 --> 02:58:39.087]  Censor Jesse Ventura Search it!
[02:58:39.167 --> 02:58:40.148]  Ram it down their throat!
