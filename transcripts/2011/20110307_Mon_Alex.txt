[00:00:04.954 --> 00:00:06.256]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.256 --> 00:00:08.038]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.038 --> 00:00:09.800]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.382]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.382 --> 00:00:12.923]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.923 --> 00:00:17.128]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.128 --> 00:00:21.173]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.951 --> 00:00:29.528]  It's had to be almost three and a half, four years, the more I think about it, since I've had a stomach bug.
[00:00:33.231 --> 00:00:34.432]  This was a really weird one.
[00:00:34.432 --> 00:00:38.934]  I got sick briefly Wednesday, and it went away that day.
[00:00:38.934 --> 00:00:43.677]  Then it came back with a vengeance on Saturday.
[00:00:43.677 --> 00:00:48.820]  And my wife had called the doctor, because my children had been sick as well, and so had she earlier in the week.
[00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:56.724]  And they said, yeah, whatever this stomach bug is, it hits you one day, and then three or four days later, it comes back.
[00:00:56.724 --> 00:00:59.426]  I am still somewhat under the weather.
[00:01:00.452 --> 00:01:08.040]  But I'm 90% better from yesterday, and so I am here with you live, and I appreciate you for joining us.
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.984]  I just wanted to up front let folks know that I am a bit under the weather.
[00:01:11.984 --> 00:01:19.831]  If it sounds like I'm somewhat inebriated, I'm speaking a little bit slower and a bit dingy.
[00:01:20.629 --> 00:01:33.993]  I've been already calling the crew by names that don't exist in this office, but I should warm up here in the first hour a bit and get rolling.
[00:01:33.993 --> 00:01:46.417]  Now, I came in today because the news is obviously of great import, of extreme importance, and we're going to be breaking it all down.
[00:01:46.417 --> 00:01:49.978]  Huge developments in the Middle East.
[00:01:51.021 --> 00:01:53.664]  In North Africa.
[00:01:53.664 --> 00:02:00.330]  We also have the British government announcing that you're not going to have power most of the time in England.
[00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.992]  This is the post-industrial world.
[00:02:01.992 --> 00:02:12.262]  They're openly saying for the earth and to stop humans from destroying the earth with carbon dioxide that they're going to be cutting your power off.
[00:02:13.504 --> 00:02:16.007]  Same thing is coming here in the United States.
[00:02:16.007 --> 00:02:19.451]  That has all been planned and laid out.
[00:02:19.451 --> 00:02:23.835]  Also, AFP is reporting the government fear-mongering.
[00:02:23.835 --> 00:02:26.839]  World 6 mass extinction may be underway.
[00:02:28.553 --> 00:02:32.674]  Study finds, they're saying that the extinction of mankind has now begun.
[00:02:32.674 --> 00:02:36.015]  This is a prestigious journal putting this out.
[00:02:36.015 --> 00:02:54.341]  So they're creating the self-fulfilling prophecy that we're all basically gonna be dying very, very soon so that as the globalists carry out these controlled plagues, people will see it as a self-fulfilling prophecy or a foregone conclusion and will accept it
[00:02:55.521 --> 00:03:01.646]  And won't do more research on why this indeed is happening.
[00:03:01.646 --> 00:03:11.454]  Now, in some of the other news on the economic front, number of health care reform laws waivers climb above 1000.
[00:03:11.454 --> 00:03:14.237]  We're going to be going over that today.
[00:03:16.864 --> 00:03:18.105]  The Essence of Tyranny.
[00:03:34.642 --> 00:03:38.003]  And on the newscast, they didn't even point it out.
[00:03:38.003 --> 00:03:41.845]  Senator John Kerry said, I'm against any military action.
[00:03:41.845 --> 00:03:49.827]  That's why I only want to bomb their airfields in Libya and have a no-fly zone.
[00:03:49.827 --> 00:03:56.950]  So they just practice up is down, down is up, black is white, white is black.
[00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.952]  They just practice all of this now in everyone's face.
[00:04:04.172 --> 00:04:12.337]  Where they just throw it all out there.
[00:04:12.337 --> 00:04:18.381]  Oh, we all agree there shouldn't be military action in Libya.
[00:04:18.381 --> 00:04:27.086]  But we need to go ahead and bomb their airfields and the no-fly zone because that's not a military action.
[00:04:28.462 --> 00:04:31.386]  That's what Kerry said.
[00:04:31.386 --> 00:04:35.351]  McCain said he agreed with him that we didn't need military action.
[00:04:35.351 --> 00:04:38.816]  We needed to just bomb them.
[00:04:38.816 --> 00:04:41.479]  I mean, they just are really trying to
[00:04:43.266 --> 00:04:46.288]  Set the precedent to get away with anything they want.
[00:04:46.288 --> 00:04:50.090]  We're going to go over all of this on the other side of this quick break.
[00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.951]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:04:50.951 --> 00:04:53.832]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:04:53.832 --> 00:04:55.433]  GCNLive.com.
[00:04:55.433 --> 00:04:58.235]  My websites are InfoWars.com, PressButton.com.
[00:05:00.302 --> 00:05:01.463]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:05:01.463 --> 00:05:08.407]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:05:08.407 --> 00:05:10.949]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:16.333]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:05:16.333 --> 00:05:19.375]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:05:19.375 --> 00:05:21.436]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:05:21.676 --> 00:05:27.941]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:05:27.941 --> 00:05:31.323]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:05:31.323 --> 00:05:37.107]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:05:37.107 --> 00:05:38.748]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:05:38.748 --> 00:05:40.029]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:42.711]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:05:42.711 --> 00:05:46.934]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:05:46.934 --> 00:05:49.536]  You can find the video at www dot
[00:05:49.716 --> 00:05:51.540]  End of America 3 dot com.
[00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.126]  That's End of America, the number 3 dot com.

[00:06:01.806 --> 00:06:05.769]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:06:05.769 --> 00:06:14.636]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:06:14.636 --> 00:06:19.260]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:30.089]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:06:30.709 --> 00:06:40.212]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:06:40.212 --> 00:06:45.654]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:06:45.654 --> 00:06:53.137]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:06:53.137 --> 00:06:55.878]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:05.054]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:07:05.054 --> 00:07:08.298]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:07:08.298 --> 00:07:13.083]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:07:13.083 --> 00:07:19.490]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.733]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:07:22.253 --> 00:07:22.553]  Tim Geithner?
[00:07:22.553 --> 00:07:23.073]  Bernanke?
[00:07:23.073 --> 00:07:23.734]  They're arsonists!
[00:07:23.734 --> 00:07:24.834]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:07:24.834 --> 00:07:27.255]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:07:41.161 --> 00:07:45.527]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[00:07:45.527 --> 00:07:48.430]  we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:57.562]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.821]  Devastating globalist lies.
[00:08:07.821 --> 00:08:12.163]  Exposing the mainstream media's propaganda machine.
[00:08:12.163 --> 00:08:15.305]  Tirelessly waging war on corruption.
[00:08:15.305 --> 00:08:19.667]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6 in Austin, Texas.
[00:08:19.667 --> 00:08:21.928]  Transmitting worldwide.
[00:08:21.928 --> 00:08:24.089]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:24.089 --> 00:08:28.131]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:08:34.255 --> 00:08:40.060]  It is Monday, the 7th day of March 2011.
[00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:42.722]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:08:42.722 --> 00:08:45.164]  We're going to have wide open phones today.
[00:08:45.164 --> 00:08:55.732]  Wayne Madsen briefly pops in with his take on the increasing prices in commodities, oil, what's happening in the Middle East and North Africa.
[00:08:55.732 --> 00:08:59.495]  Max Keiser, also still in the Middle East, is scheduled to be popping in.
[00:09:00.416 --> 00:09:07.202]  With another quick 10 minute report, but in the meantime, we're going to have open phones throughout the broadcast today.
[00:09:08.407 --> 00:09:16.091]  We just had a caller call the office from the first little five-minute segment and ask if I'd had a stroke or if I was drinking cough medicine.
[00:09:16.091 --> 00:09:19.874]  Now, I've had no cough medicine and I haven't had a stroke.
[00:09:19.874 --> 00:09:25.957]  I had some type of flu over the weekend, but I am back and I am good.
[00:09:25.957 --> 00:09:29.059]  Also, Friday night, put a piece of pizza in the microwave.
[00:09:29.059 --> 00:09:30.680]  I never really use the microwave.
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.662]  And you know how it unevenly heats pizza?
[00:09:33.662 --> 00:09:35.983]  Grab the piece of cheese pizza out.
[00:09:35.983 --> 00:09:37.664]  It was so hot, burned my lip.
[00:09:38.717 --> 00:09:57.720]  I mean, I have just had quite a weekend, ladies and gentlemen, but yes, I did notice that when I got live during the first segment there that I sounded like a lethargic sloth who'd been drinking too much mead, but I am here and I can already
[00:09:58.681 --> 00:10:02.766]  I can already feel my brain awakening, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:02.766 --> 00:10:07.051]  And so we've got an important transmission lined up for you today.
[00:10:07.051 --> 00:10:11.296]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:10:11.296 --> 00:10:15.260]  But my wife is like, why are you getting out of bed?
[00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.903]  Why are you coming down there to do the show?
[00:10:21.106 --> 00:10:29.230]  I'm blessed I haven't been sick in three or four years other than like allergies and stuff but some people never get sick.
[00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:41.197]  I wish I was like them because well you know that feeling after you've really been sick your brain feels swollen and your eyes feel kind of crossed and you have trouble focusing.
[00:10:42.176 --> 00:10:44.317]  Well, that's how I am right now.
[00:10:44.317 --> 00:10:50.499]  So this should be an interesting three hours here today, an experiment in broadcasting.
[00:10:50.499 --> 00:10:53.559]  But I can feel the blood flowing through my brain.
[00:10:53.559 --> 00:10:58.121]  I can feel the awakening happening.
[00:10:58.121 --> 00:11:00.862]  You know, what happened is, yesterday, in bed,
[00:11:03.027 --> 00:11:10.573]  Surfing around on my iPad, I was reading all this news and burning with desire to get in here today and do the show.
[00:11:10.573 --> 00:11:17.759]  That's why I ended up calling in while Paul Watson was filling in last night to talk about some important issues.
[00:11:17.759 --> 00:11:22.403]  And then this morning I got up and saw the news and I said, I've got to come in.
[00:11:22.403 --> 00:11:24.765]  This is all just too important.
[00:11:24.765 --> 00:11:26.026]  And it certainly is important.
[00:11:28.703 --> 00:11:32.670]  So I'm going to be going over all of this news here in just a moment.
[00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:34.593]  We are going to open the phones up today.
[00:11:34.593 --> 00:11:37.958]  I am going to lean on the callers as they say.
[00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:41.003]  So please have your question, your comment ready.
[00:11:42.162 --> 00:11:59.416]  And who knows, one of the few times I've actually been able to take a hundred phone calls or so is when I have been under the weather because then my brain isn't burning with understanding and obnoxiousness where it's bouncing around like a wild pinball.
[00:11:59.416 --> 00:12:05.902]  It's more relaxed and so I can actually answer your questions quietly and succinctly and quickly.
[00:12:06.542 --> 00:12:08.403]  And get more of you on air.
[00:12:08.403 --> 00:12:10.484]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:12:10.484 --> 00:12:10.564]  800-259-9231.
[00:12:10.564 --> 00:12:12.385]  And we will get you up and on the air.
[00:12:12.385 --> 00:12:12.465]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:12:12.465 --> 00:12:14.426]  Man, I am slurring my words here.
[00:12:14.426 --> 00:12:16.087]  Maybe I shouldn't be on air today.
[00:12:38.087 --> 00:12:43.830]  Oh man.
[00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:46.371]  I felt a lot better before I got on air.
[00:12:46.371 --> 00:12:49.233]  Hmm.
[00:12:49.233 --> 00:12:52.114]  Hold on just a minute.
[00:12:52.114 --> 00:12:53.775]  Waking up here.
[00:12:53.775 --> 00:12:55.416]  Waking up.
[00:12:55.416 --> 00:12:59.378]  Another big problem with this is is I'm so accustomed to my own show.
[00:12:59.378 --> 00:13:03.640]  I'll guarantee you if I was in studio with somebody else I'd be more awake even though I'm sick.
[00:13:08.168 --> 00:13:12.931]  But we're gonna get the job done today here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:12.931 --> 00:13:16.314]  It's also kind of daunting looking at all this news.
[00:13:16.314 --> 00:13:37.228]  It makes it more daunting than normal, than usual here, because it makes me realize how exhausting it is to research this information, to have a deep understanding of it, and then to come back on air and cover it after I've already researched it, and to know that I just can't do justice verbally
[00:13:38.715 --> 00:13:44.899]  audibly, semantically, to what the mind can behold and understand.
[00:13:44.899 --> 00:14:05.634]  And I've many times used the analogy of it's like trying to describe to someone what a Rocky Mountain Vista looks like at sunrise or sunset, or what
[00:14:09.175 --> 00:14:17.919]  What it's like to be scuba diving 50 feet down in crystal clear water on the side of a reef.
[00:14:17.919 --> 00:14:20.521]  You can't really verbally describe it very well.
[00:14:20.521 --> 00:14:23.963]  One has to see it to experience it.
[00:14:23.963 --> 00:14:31.967]  And it's the same for these bad things that we cover, the terrible things that we cover.
[00:14:31.967 --> 00:14:34.248]  Words really can't describe
[00:14:36.297 --> 00:14:37.498]  How important it is.
[00:14:37.498 --> 00:14:40.179]  Oh, I do want to say one thing.
[00:14:40.179 --> 00:14:51.243]  Please, when I open the phones up, don't tell me get better or here's a hot toddy for you or here's something to make you get better.
[00:14:51.243 --> 00:14:56.385]  I shouldn't have even probably been on air today, but I'm here and I'm going to do it.
[00:14:56.385 --> 00:15:00.347]  But please, please don't do that.
[00:15:00.347 --> 00:15:04.669]  Because you know that it's all pointless now anyways.
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:16.067]  Okay, let me just mention the stacks of news I have here in front of me.
[00:15:16.067 --> 00:15:18.609]  We're all North Koreans now.
[00:15:18.609 --> 00:15:25.835]  Era of constant electricity at home is ending, says UK Power Chief.
[00:15:25.835 --> 00:15:31.459]  And then I have right here, and we'll show you this on screen.
[00:15:31.459 --> 00:15:33.841]  I have right here the actual news article.
[00:15:35.336 --> 00:15:53.057]  Error of constant electricity at home is ending, says Power Chief, and this is out of the Daily Telegraph, and it says the days of permanently available electricity have been coming to an end, the head of the power network said yesterday, and they said to tackle climate change
[00:15:54.990 --> 00:16:01.635]  Within the next 10 years, you're not going to be able to have power whenever you want it on a routine basis.
[00:16:01.635 --> 00:16:04.578]  You'll only have power when the government wants you to.
[00:16:04.578 --> 00:16:09.602]  But of course, you'll end up then still paying more for power.
[00:16:09.602 --> 00:16:11.164]  It's what the UN has called for.
[00:16:11.164 --> 00:16:16.088]  It's what the head of the NASA Climatology Department at Goddard has called for.
[00:16:16.088 --> 00:16:17.529]  It's a post-industrial world.
[00:16:17.529 --> 00:16:19.230]  Maury Strong, all of them.
[00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:20.652]  See, it's all about control.
[00:16:22.483 --> 00:16:24.985]  It's all about shutting society down.
[00:16:24.985 --> 00:16:27.006]  It's called feudalism.
[00:16:27.006 --> 00:16:28.848]  And here's another big report I'm going to get into.
[00:16:28.848 --> 00:16:36.774]  World's sixth mass extinction may be underway, study says, due to climate change.
[00:16:36.774 --> 00:16:43.539]  So we're going to be extinct soon, humans are, due to climate change, which has been proven to be a complete fraud.
[00:16:43.539 --> 00:16:46.241]  Meanwhile, they don't debate any of the real threats to humanity.
[00:16:47.866 --> 00:16:58.292]  Expanding along those lines, this is out of the Hill newspaper, number of health care reform law waivers climbs above 1,000.
[00:16:58.292 --> 00:17:15.021]  1,040 organizations, including Fortune 500 companies like McDonald's, have been given complete and total waivers from having to buy health insurance.
[00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:18.331]  But then your company does.
[00:17:18.331 --> 00:17:40.549]  The essence, the essence of unfair weights and measures, the essence of tyranny, the essence of fraud, of government special favors handed out to their minions.
[00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:42.411]  This is mafia government.
[00:17:42.411 --> 00:17:43.832]  We're going to be going over more of that
[00:17:45.981 --> 00:18:13.964]  I really can't do justice to this, but it really is a hollow victory in that ego-wise I could care less, but it does signify that we are breaking through more and more to the mainstream when they've tried to have a blockade of our information for over a decade.
[00:18:15.422 --> 00:18:33.293]  But two different articles in Rolling Stone, two online, one big feature, one in the March issue that starts on page 50.
[00:18:33.293 --> 00:18:36.415]  And it says, the most paranoid man in America.
[00:18:36.415 --> 00:18:39.096]  Yeah, I wish I was just paranoid.
[00:18:39.096 --> 00:18:41.338]  I wish this information wasn't right.
[00:18:42.763 --> 00:18:45.439]  There's this big feature report in Rolling Stone.
[00:18:48.266 --> 00:18:55.211]  And there's also another one that's, I think, a lot better by the same author that was just online.
[00:18:55.211 --> 00:19:14.924]  Glenn Beck's shtick, Alex Jones got there first, and they go over a detailed analysis of Glenn Beck ripping us off word for word, which I wouldn't have a problem with, except that then he does things like block me from getting on Fox News as a guest, which isn't that big of a deal, except that it just shows him
[00:19:15.985 --> 00:19:22.467]  Telling people then who are guests on this show To not be guests on this show or that he won't interview them.
[00:19:22.467 --> 00:19:27.268]  I've been told this by prominent people Of course will not give out their names hence.
[00:19:27.268 --> 00:19:44.472]  I might lose that source But it is frustrating very frustrating to To have him involved in what I'm doing constantly, but I understand why he's doing that I mean he knows That I'm the real deal
[00:19:45.919 --> 00:19:48.801]  Most of us eat a blend of processed, man-made, and all-natural food.
[00:19:48.801 --> 00:19:55.047]  But the food you eat may not provide all the nutrition your body needs.
[00:19:55.047 --> 00:19:58.109]  We now know that liquid vitamin supplements are absorbed faster than pills.
[00:19:58.109 --> 00:19:59.170]  That's why you need...
[00:20:15.797 --> 00:20:16.978]  Sea Energy.

[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:04.684]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:21:04.684 --> 00:21:10.569]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:21:10.569 --> 00:21:11.690]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:15.673]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:21:16.374 --> 00:21:30.187]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:21:30.187 --> 00:21:35.792]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:21:35.792 --> 00:21:41.677]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[00:21:47.883 --> 00:21:47.943]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.101 --> 00:22:05.124]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:22:05.124 --> 00:22:08.366]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:22:08.366 --> 00:22:13.169]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:22:13.169 --> 00:22:19.553]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:22:19.553 --> 00:22:21.795]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:22:22.335 --> 00:22:22.655]  Tim Geithner?
[00:22:22.655 --> 00:22:22.955]  Bernanke?
[00:22:22.955 --> 00:22:23.476]  They're arsonists!
[00:22:23.476 --> 00:22:24.276]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:22:24.276 --> 00:22:25.958]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:22:41.249 --> 00:22:43.110]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:48.514]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:22:48.514 --> 00:22:59.462]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:22:59.462 --> 00:23:08.688]  Nine years, thousands of clients worldwide, amazing results, and here's more proof of the effectiveness of how heart and body extract supports good circulation and healthy arterial flow.
[00:23:08.968 --> 00:23:10.289]  My name is Crystal.
[00:23:10.289 --> 00:23:13.212]  I'm a 45 year old and live in Houston, Texas.
[00:23:13.212 --> 00:23:17.175]  I was diagnosed with having mitral valve prolapse 10 years ago.
[00:23:17.175 --> 00:23:21.318]  My cardiologist said surgery and drugs was the only thing he could offer me.
[00:23:21.318 --> 00:23:22.159]  What did Crystal do?
[00:23:22.159 --> 00:23:24.601]  I ordered heart and body extract in August 2006.
[00:23:26.102 --> 00:23:32.504]  When I first took my first 15 drops, I embraced the formula and could even feel the goodness of the formula starting to work.
[00:23:32.504 --> 00:23:36.345]  Clean, clear arteries are happy arteries after using Heart and Body Extract.

[00:24:00.473 --> 00:24:05.056]  Alright, I'm gonna make myself get fired up and focused.
[00:24:05.056 --> 00:24:05.877]  I can do it!
[00:24:12.152 --> 00:24:19.895]  And if I continue to struggle doing the live broadcast today, I've got Aaron Dyke standing by to come in here and do the show.
[00:24:19.895 --> 00:24:23.217]  All right, let's get into the news right now and then your phone calls.
[00:24:23.217 --> 00:24:29.119]  Qaddafi insists Al-Qaeda is to blame for chaos and killings.
[00:24:29.119 --> 00:24:30.780]  And that's absolutely right.
[00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:33.181]  Who did they use to attack the Serbs in the 1990s?
[00:24:33.181 --> 00:24:33.721]  Al-Qaeda on record.
[00:24:35.942 --> 00:24:39.224]  Who do they use to attack the Russians to start that war?
[00:24:39.224 --> 00:24:41.725]  Mujahideen slash Al Qaeda.
[00:24:41.725 --> 00:24:45.887]  Who do they use over and over again as their frontline vanguard?
[00:24:45.887 --> 00:24:48.389]  It's the Muslim brigades.
[00:24:48.389 --> 00:24:56.653]  But the general public could never get it through their head that the Muslim extremists are financed and funded by the globalists.
[00:24:56.653 --> 00:24:57.794]  It's just that simple.
[00:24:58.809 --> 00:25:03.171]  And now British special forces have been captured.
[00:25:03.171 --> 00:25:09.633]  We of course reported a month ago that they were already in Libya before this turmoil even began.
[00:25:09.633 --> 00:25:15.055]  Qaddafi insists Al Qaeda is to blame for chaos and killings.
[00:25:15.055 --> 00:25:27.379]  In an exclusive interview with France 24, Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi repeated his claim that Al Qaeda was responsible for plunging the country into chaos and denied media reports of mass killings.
[00:25:28.559 --> 00:25:43.012]  Al Qaeda is responsible for the violent uprising in Libya, but Western media has overstated the extent of the political crisis and its casualty, leader Muammar Gaddafi told Francis 24 in an exclusive interview on Sunday.
[00:25:43.012 --> 00:25:48.417]  He also said, look out, millions of black Africans are coming your way, Europe, if you let
[00:25:48.857 --> 00:26:00.666]  Libya fall and it is true that he's been controlling immigration from North Africa over the Mediterranean into Southern Europe.
[00:26:00.666 --> 00:26:03.488]  There have been almost 150 to 200 people killed.
[00:26:03.488 --> 00:26:08.152]  People should come here and see how many people have been killed.
[00:26:08.152 --> 00:26:12.615]  They can come and check among the population, among the police and the army.
[00:26:12.615 --> 00:26:14.897]  A seemingly collected Qaddafi explained.
[00:26:14.897 --> 00:26:16.398]  Alright, I'm gonna stop right here.
[00:26:17.725 --> 00:26:38.630]  I'm not a fan of Gaddafi, I'm not a fan of Hazem Mubarak, any of these guys, but there's no doubt now, it's admitted on record, that Western intelligence is overthrowing these countries and putting basically new puppet dictators in power in
[00:26:40.783 --> 00:26:44.625]  Egypt and now to the west of Egypt in Libya.
[00:26:44.625 --> 00:27:03.054]  They're attempting this and now they're openly saying yes Senator Kerry Says we need to bomb their airfields and have airstrikes on key installations and we need to have a no-fly zone and shoot down their aircraft and Jam them jam their
[00:27:04.995 --> 00:27:33.999]  military frequencies but all of us agree there should be no military action only bombing their airfields that's like saying all of us agree that we should not punch you in the nose so we're going to punch you in your nose now because we agree we shouldn't punch you in the nose they just practice absurdity like we're unconscious idiots because they know the general public is unconscious that they're in a dream state watching television
[00:27:35.168 --> 00:27:38.291]  But more and more people are actually seeing through it.
[00:27:38.291 --> 00:27:44.417]  But Gaddafi insists Al-Qaeda is to blame for chaos and killings.
[00:27:44.417 --> 00:27:48.801]  Now this was from Saturday before the SAS got captured.
[00:27:48.801 --> 00:27:52.104]  The British quite proud of their invincible troops.
[00:27:52.104 --> 00:27:57.909]  Kind of like the Israelis quite proud of their invincible troops until they got beaten three and a half years ago in Lebanon.
[00:27:58.959 --> 00:28:04.021]  Fancy your chances against the SAS, Gaddafi.
[00:28:04.021 --> 00:28:08.523]  Oh, fancy yourself against the British SAS.
[00:28:08.523 --> 00:28:11.865]  They're unstoppable.
[00:28:11.865 --> 00:28:17.947]  Elite troops and MI6 spies poised to help Libyan rebels.
[00:28:17.947 --> 00:28:22.069]  The only problem is the Libyan rebels didn't want them and have detained eight of them.
[00:28:24.073 --> 00:28:26.513]  Very interesting on that front.
[00:28:26.513 --> 00:28:37.616]  Meanwhile, Obama is calling for Saudi Arabia to ship in masses of armaments into the eastern part of Libya so they can take Tripoli.
[00:28:37.616 --> 00:28:42.697]  And it has now been confirmed there wasn't any strafing runs of the population.
[00:28:42.697 --> 00:28:46.818]  That's only what our government does with the 1,000 plus drones.
[00:28:46.818 --> 00:28:48.818]  It's just like babies in incubators.
[00:28:48.818 --> 00:28:51.078]  Saddam was there throwing them out of the incubators.
[00:28:51.078 --> 00:28:52.259]  Wasn't true.
[00:28:52.259 --> 00:28:53.679]  But hey, feels good.
[00:28:55.128 --> 00:28:57.029]  Feels good.
[00:28:57.029 --> 00:28:59.391]  You got a million dead real Iraqis.
[00:28:59.391 --> 00:29:02.392]  Good, that's what they deserve.
[00:29:02.392 --> 00:29:04.934]  Brown people kill them, Muslims kill them.
[00:29:04.934 --> 00:29:11.078]  Meanwhile though, there were Kuwaiti babies, brown babies getting thrown out of incubators.
[00:29:11.078 --> 00:29:12.538]  Oh no!
[00:29:12.538 --> 00:29:16.181]  We better bomb them all with DU.
[00:29:16.181 --> 00:29:16.821]  Oh, guess what?
[00:29:16.821 --> 00:29:20.783]  The incubator story wasn't true, like WMD's a decade later.
[00:29:20.783 --> 00:29:22.585]  I don't care, it feels good.
[00:29:22.585 --> 00:29:24.586]  Alright, I'm waking up.
[00:29:25.632 --> 00:29:28.092]  I'm back in the saddle.
[00:29:28.092 --> 00:29:35.554]  We're going to go over all this incredible news, and then your phone calls.
[00:29:35.554 --> 00:29:48.536]  But I've got the news on how your energy's going to be cut more and more, and how you'll be trained to accept rolling lockouts, the 1,000 plus health care reform waivers, a bunch of economic news.
[00:29:48.536 --> 00:29:50.696]  Stay with us.
[00:29:50.696 --> 00:29:52.097]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.097 --> 00:29:53.597]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:57.306]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.302 --> 00:30:04.845]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:30:04.845 --> 00:30:05.765]  Number 1.
[00:30:05.765 --> 00:30:09.188]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:09.188 --> 00:30:10.048]  Number 2.
[00:30:10.048 --> 00:30:14.951]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:14.951 --> 00:30:15.692]  It's true.
[00:30:15.692 --> 00:30:20.555]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:20.555 --> 00:30:21.375]  Number 3.
[00:30:21.375 --> 00:30:24.978]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:24.978 --> 00:30:28.680]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:32.421]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:30:32.421 --> 00:30:36.103]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:36.103 --> 00:30:41.045]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:30:41.045 --> 00:30:46.087]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:30:46.087 --> 00:30:50.268]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:50.268 --> 00:30:52.069]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[00:30:56.971 --> 00:31:00.072]  877-327-0365.
[00:31:00.072 --> 00:31:01.252]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:31:01.252 --> 00:31:08.174]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:31:08.174 --> 00:31:10.714]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:31:10.714 --> 00:31:16.096]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:31:16.096 --> 00:31:19.136]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:31:19.136 --> 00:31:21.197]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:31:21.457 --> 00:31:27.700]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:31.081]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:31:31.081 --> 00:31:36.864]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:31:36.864 --> 00:31:38.505]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:31:38.505 --> 00:31:39.805]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:31:39.805 --> 00:31:42.486]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:31:42.486 --> 00:31:43.907]  He explains everything you need to know.
[00:31:44.167 --> 00:31:46.689]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:31:46.689 --> 00:31:51.312]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:31:51.312 --> 00:31:53.914]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[00:32:00.962 --> 00:32:07.985]  Alex has told you that the Mideast uprisings over food prices and shortages caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide.
[00:32:07.985 --> 00:32:10.667]  We're seeing the impact right here in the United States.
[00:32:10.667 --> 00:32:19.711]  Ethanol that was supposed to reduce petroleum use and fuel prices hit a 30-month high in February, and pump prices are expected to reach $5 a gallon.
[00:32:19.711 --> 00:32:27.955]  Because of shipping costs, food is being priced out of the reach of millions of Americans, with an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days.
[00:32:27.955 --> 00:32:28.595]  Move quickly!

[00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:14.278]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:19.741 --> 00:33:25.383]  Now, we already heard this three weeks ago, but they're putting it back out again.
[00:33:25.383 --> 00:33:36.667]  Paul Joseph Watson has the headline at PrisonPlanet.com, Oil and Gold Slip on Rumors Qaddafi Set to Flee.
[00:33:36.667 --> 00:33:39.748]  But again, we've already heard that he ran to Venezuela three weeks ago.
[00:33:41.497 --> 00:33:55.180]  Oil and gold paired some of their soaring gains today after a rumor began circulating that Muammar Gaddafi was seeking to reach an agreement with rebels that would allow him to safely flee the country and return for relinquishing power.
[00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:57.120]  Well, I mean, he could just fly out of the country.
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:59.020]  Why does he need rebels authorization?
[00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:01.081]  That makes no sense.
[00:34:01.081 --> 00:34:04.641]  Gold hit another record high this morning, rising to $1,445.70 an ounce.
[00:34:09.366 --> 00:34:14.489]  before reversing itself as traders absorbed the rumors.
[00:34:14.489 --> 00:34:23.295]  Similarly, ICE Brent April oil hit 118.50 cents peak before pulling back.
[00:34:23.295 --> 00:34:38.605]  The pullback was sparked by rumors that Gaddafi sent a negotiator to transnational counsel in order to secure the safe exit of him and his family in return for him handing over power to the rebel leaders.
[00:34:39.673 --> 00:34:44.236]  Rebel leaders can only hold a few towns and cities.
[00:34:44.236 --> 00:34:45.957]  He has all the airfields.
[00:34:45.957 --> 00:34:47.638]  He has allies all over Africa.
[00:34:47.638 --> 00:34:49.579]  He's paid off.
[00:34:49.579 --> 00:34:50.560]  This doesn't make sense.
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:54.282]  I mean, I know Watson's quoting mainstream news reports, but it's very strange.
[00:34:55.874 --> 00:34:59.655]  Of course, it's the usual suspects, the BBC saying this.
[00:34:59.655 --> 00:35:03.756]  It was the British Foreign Secretary saying this three weeks ago as well.
[00:35:03.756 --> 00:35:11.919]  The story was carried by the pan-Arab newspaper Al-Sharq Al-Zawahd and was also picked up by BBC.
[00:35:11.919 --> 00:35:24.563]  Libyan sources have told the pan-Arab newspaper that Colonel Qaddafi has turned to the rebel Transnational Council to secure his departure from the country in return for guaranteeing
[00:35:26.172 --> 00:35:27.593]  I don't know if you can believe any of this.
[00:35:27.593 --> 00:35:35.759]  So this is done to again further make it look like that he's destabilized, that he's weak
[00:35:55.882 --> 00:35:58.083]  What's the larger issue for this?
[00:35:58.083 --> 00:36:03.305]  What's the larger reason that they want this?
[00:36:03.305 --> 00:36:06.126]  They want the entire region in flames.
[00:36:06.126 --> 00:36:08.307]  They want to destabilize the planet.
[00:36:08.307 --> 00:36:10.648]  The globalists want order out of chaos.
[00:36:10.648 --> 00:36:16.550]  It's really very, very simple what's happening.
[00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:19.651]  And if you look at the people that run our government and run our country,
[00:36:21.004 --> 00:36:31.829]  They have the same amount of respect for us that they have for the Libyans or for the Iraqis or for people in Zimbabwe or Argentina.
[00:36:31.829 --> 00:36:38.112]  The globalists are ruthless parasites who are sucking us dry.
[00:36:38.112 --> 00:36:42.694]  And they could care less about our well-being.
[00:36:42.694 --> 00:36:49.137]  In fact, they want to use poverty as a tool of systematic degradation and control.
[00:36:58.951 --> 00:36:59.751]  Let me do this.
[00:36:59.751 --> 00:37:02.892]  Let me go ahead and go to some of your phone calls.
[00:37:02.892 --> 00:37:05.533]  And then I'm going to continue with what's happening in North Africa.
[00:37:05.533 --> 00:37:08.594]  In fact, let me just run through the headlines on this now.
[00:37:08.594 --> 00:37:14.396]  First, we were hearing how invincible the SAS were and how they're basically supermen that no one can stop.
[00:37:14.396 --> 00:37:16.156]  This was the headline Saturday.
[00:37:16.156 --> 00:37:21.038]  Fancy, fancy all chances against the SAS Qaddafi.
[00:37:21.038 --> 00:37:27.620]  Elite, elite troops and MI6 spies poised to help Libyan rebels.
[00:37:28.797 --> 00:37:34.721]  This is all part of the illusion that globalist forces are invincible.
[00:37:34.721 --> 00:37:40.245]  The image of MI6 people being James Bond.
[00:37:40.245 --> 00:37:49.412]  Or the image of FBI agents being like, you know, 24.
[00:37:49.412 --> 00:37:57.418]  But then when you really are out covering issues or at Bilderberg covering an event and you see the FBI,
[00:37:58.991 --> 00:38:05.856]  Most of them are like clowns in their little black suits trying to intimidate you, talking into their arm piece.
[00:38:05.856 --> 00:38:07.017]  It's just all a bunch of hype.
[00:38:07.017 --> 00:38:08.718]  It's all a big, big illusion.
[00:38:08.718 --> 00:38:14.302]  All these big towering marble government buildings are meant to make you feel small.
[00:38:14.302 --> 00:38:23.889]  All of this is so that you feel weak when in truth you have all the power.
[00:38:23.889 --> 00:38:24.830]  Continuing here.
[00:38:25.914 --> 00:38:30.637]  They were talking about fancy yourselves against the SAS.
[00:38:30.637 --> 00:38:33.499]  You're not going to be doing too well, you Gaddafi.
[00:38:33.499 --> 00:38:36.140]  SAS are on the ground.
[00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:40.243]  One SAS man is worth 10,000 North Africans.
[00:38:40.243 --> 00:38:42.784]  Nothing can stop them.
[00:38:42.784 --> 00:38:44.045]  Well, here you go.
[00:38:44.045 --> 00:38:45.166]  Libya.
[00:38:45.166 --> 00:38:48.988]  Eight SAS soldiers held by rebels.
[00:38:48.988 --> 00:38:50.749]  Dewebles.
[00:38:50.749 --> 00:38:52.970]  Remember, was it six years ago?
[00:38:53.936 --> 00:38:54.016]  It's
[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:18.521]  Classic Explosives running around mischief-making.
[00:39:18.521 --> 00:39:25.203]  They sent British tanks in to assault the jail and killed a bunch of the Iraqi police.
[00:39:25.203 --> 00:39:32.945]  A little civil war because they were starting to interrogate them about the British staging terror attacks all over Iraq.
[00:39:32.945 --> 00:39:37.106]  Let me tell you who pulls triggers on our troops.
[00:39:37.106 --> 00:39:39.387]  British, Israeli, and US contractors.
[00:39:40.689 --> 00:39:45.793]  I would have to say from the numbers I've seen in internal sources, more than half of the dead U.S.
[00:39:45.793 --> 00:39:49.056]  troops were killed by our own people.
[00:39:49.056 --> 00:39:50.957]  You're like, well, that doesn't make sense.
[00:39:50.957 --> 00:39:52.799]  It makes perfect sense.
[00:39:52.799 --> 00:39:57.783]  You got a trillion bucks a year going into those two wars, black holes.
[00:39:57.783 --> 00:40:00.104]  You got to have an excuse to stay there.
[00:40:00.104 --> 00:40:03.027]  Look, look, they run the same tricks every two years.
[00:40:04.431 --> 00:40:09.816]  Remember five years ago, they said, oh, in two years, we'll look at pulling out.
[00:40:09.816 --> 00:40:11.777]  Then in two years, we're going to pull out.
[00:40:11.777 --> 00:40:17.402]  Well, Secretary of Defense Gates announced today that now they won't look at pulling out until 2014.
[00:40:17.402 --> 00:40:20.925]  And then in 2014, they'll look at pulling out in 2016.
[00:40:20.925 --> 00:40:22.966]  And then in 2016, they'll look at pulling out
[00:40:28.217 --> 00:40:28.637]  We're good to go.
[00:40:53.666 --> 00:41:04.014]  When your kids get caught running this stuff up their veins, we're gonna put them in prisons owned by the same private central banks that launder the money.
[00:41:04.014 --> 00:41:07.797]  And the average yuppie's gonna go, good!
[00:41:07.797 --> 00:41:09.799]  I like it!
[00:41:09.799 --> 00:41:12.361]  And that's why we failed.
[00:41:12.361 --> 00:41:21.548]  You know, last night I was watching television, I was watching History Channel, or the Military Channel, and I couldn't help but
[00:41:22.984 --> 00:41:32.109]  Feeling all patriotic and pro-war watching World War II reels.
[00:41:32.109 --> 00:41:36.691]  On the Military Channel, they were airing old news reels about the march in the Pacific.
[00:41:39.119 --> 00:41:45.124]  And about the island hopping and taking this island and then taking that island.
[00:41:45.124 --> 00:41:50.028]  At an emotional level, I was all proud of America defeating the Japanese.
[00:41:50.028 --> 00:41:52.710]  But even by that point in the 1940s, early 1940s, mid 1940s,
[00:41:55.612 --> 00:42:03.994]  Our country had been taken over by the private central banks that had maneuvered the Japanese to attack us, that had cut off their oil, that had had U.S.
[00:42:03.994 --> 00:42:14.777]  forces operating as private mercenaries, the Flying Tigers and others, attacking the Japanese all over the Pacific out of China.
[00:42:14.777 --> 00:42:17.198]  And it was all just a giant setup.
[00:42:20.973 --> 00:42:26.157]  And then we won World War II, so we felt like we're the good guys, we can do no wrong.
[00:42:26.157 --> 00:42:29.500]  So we totally trust the government.
[00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:32.982]  And the Bill of Rights and Constitution have basically been overturned.
[00:42:32.982 --> 00:42:41.569]  And then now here's our government using our country to launch wars in Libya, Afghanistan, Iraq.
[00:42:41.569 --> 00:42:46.533]  I mean, our troops are in 160 plus countries, and they're not our troops.
[00:42:46.533 --> 00:42:47.874]  It's not our military.
[00:42:50.965 --> 00:42:55.166]  Our military is running illegal checkpoints all over the country.
[00:42:55.166 --> 00:42:59.668]  Our military is training with foreign troops for gun confiscation.
[00:42:59.668 --> 00:43:05.650]  Our military, every chance they get during a natural disaster like Katrina, doesn't bring food and water.
[00:43:05.650 --> 00:43:10.592]  They come in and confiscate the guns, and it's all on the news.
[00:43:10.592 --> 00:43:17.334]  And I was thinking about this last night, because I keep revisiting this periodically.
[00:43:19.039 --> 00:43:21.560]  But never really getting into it in any detail.
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:28.223]  I need to go back and pull up all the old mainstream news articles and show this progressive rollout.
[00:43:28.223 --> 00:43:32.285]  I guess Police State 4, Rise of FEMA actually does it.
[00:43:32.285 --> 00:43:35.707]  But I want to do like a short report with it all in it.
[00:43:35.707 --> 00:43:43.451]  And I just think about how much it freaks me out to have this article and others from two weeks ago
[00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:47.401]  Canada, U.S.
[00:43:47.401 --> 00:43:51.584]  agree to use each other's troops in civil emergencies.
[00:43:51.584 --> 00:44:03.635]  Now again, this came out under the SPP.
[00:44:09.847 --> 00:44:13.070]  And it came out in the news again just a few weeks ago.
[00:44:13.070 --> 00:44:20.978]  The copy that I have printed here is actually from February 22nd, 2008.
[00:44:20.978 --> 00:44:25.042]  But the issue is then just last year we heard U.S.
[00:44:25.042 --> 00:44:29.987]  troops are up at the Olympics to help look for terrorists.
[00:44:31.798 --> 00:44:34.040]  All of this stuff moves incrementally.
[00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:42.768]  The globalists take their time isolating us, conditioning us, rolling these programs out.
[00:44:42.768 --> 00:44:55.280]  And I just think about the threat fusion centers and the Stasi police rollouts and all the different things that are happening and the biometrics going in to buy and sell.
[00:44:56.718 --> 00:44:56.918]  Hey Alex.
[00:45:25.643 --> 00:45:33.789]  I want to respond to that guy Friday that said that all the Jews are behind the New World Order and they should all be done away with.
[00:45:33.789 --> 00:45:39.272]  Back in 1973, it was a Jew that woke me up to the New World Order, Alan Stang.
[00:45:39.272 --> 00:45:43.635]  And through listening to his radio program on a regular basis, I joined the John Birch Society.
[00:45:43.635 --> 00:45:46.417]  And through the John Birch Society, I got to meet him in person.
[00:45:46.417 --> 00:45:49.639]  And he was really a nice guy and really a great American.
[00:45:49.639 --> 00:45:51.701]  And you look at Aaron Russo.
[00:45:55.858 --> 00:46:03.425]  Look, look, look.
[00:46:03.425 --> 00:46:12.153]  Low grade intellects always like to say it's the whites, it's the blacks, it's the Jews, it's the this, it's the that.
[00:46:12.153 --> 00:46:14.956]  It's a way for them to feel good about themselves.
[00:46:18.815 --> 00:46:25.357]  And when people attack this show with made up stuff, it's about them saying, I've succeeded in life.
[00:46:25.357 --> 00:46:27.818]  I'm better than Alex Jones.
[00:46:27.818 --> 00:46:30.639]  And, you know, I probably shouldn't have cut that collar off.
[00:46:30.639 --> 00:46:34.621]  I probably should have let him go longer because I said, so we should get rid of all the Jews.
[00:46:34.621 --> 00:46:36.761]  He said, yes, we should get rid of all of them.
[00:46:36.761 --> 00:46:37.882]  And then I let the guy go.
[00:46:37.882 --> 00:46:42.263]  And I saw a few emails and comments saying he didn't mean kill them all.
[00:46:42.263 --> 00:46:43.684]  He just meant get rid of them.
[00:46:44.204 --> 00:46:52.368]  But so I should just open the phones up for nothing but Nazis to call someday so people can really hear who these folks are.
[00:46:52.368 --> 00:46:53.488]  But I mean, it's the same thing.
[00:46:53.488 --> 00:46:55.209]  Maybe I should open the phones up.
[00:46:55.209 --> 00:47:00.792]  That'd be interesting radio just for the black nationalist, you know, who say kill all the whites.
[00:47:00.792 --> 00:47:02.512]  They all sound exactly the same.
[00:47:02.512 --> 00:47:03.693]  They're just different colored skin.
[00:47:05.193 --> 00:47:06.935]  And I mean, there's no doubt Israel's corrupt.
[00:47:06.935 --> 00:47:09.197]  There's no doubt all these countries are.
[00:47:09.197 --> 00:47:14.981]  There's no doubt Israel's up to its eyeballs in every form of, you know, wickedness you can imagine.
[00:47:14.981 --> 00:47:24.268]  But to sit there and talk about, you know, millions and millions of people and just with a broad brush say, well, because the Chinese government's corrupt.
[00:47:24.268 --> 00:47:27.170]  All Chinese are evil.
[00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:30.713]  But again, the globalists count on this.
[00:47:30.713 --> 00:47:34.056]  I've just never seen groups more hateful even of each other.
[00:47:34.787 --> 00:47:43.232]  I just was going to say that in a free republic, the individual is responsible for his own actions.
[00:47:54.847 --> 00:47:57.768]  Well, John, you've got the right perspective there.
[00:47:57.768 --> 00:48:01.189]  We need to talk about, I mean, really get it conscious in our minds.
[00:48:01.189 --> 00:48:02.110]  This is not rhetoric.
[00:48:02.110 --> 00:48:04.010]  These are not spurious charges we're laying out.
[00:48:04.010 --> 00:48:04.491]  These are detailed.
[00:48:25.171 --> 00:48:37.137]  The Global Crime Syndicate, let's name them, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Bank of England, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, Queen Beatrix, the British Royal Family.
[00:48:37.137 --> 00:48:48.583]  I mean, these are people with real power, engaged in real corruption, using our name, our treasure, our countries, to launch their corporate empires.
[00:48:48.583 --> 00:48:52.305]  And we need to talk about justice
[00:48:53.928 --> 00:48:59.151]  And point out that they're criminals and introduce the idea that they can and must be brought to justice.
[00:48:59.151 --> 00:49:04.074]  I appreciate your call.
[00:49:04.074 --> 00:49:14.880]  I don't even know what to say anymore.
[00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:20.824]  There's no doubt that the social engineers of our planet have decided to go all the way.
[00:49:24.721 --> 00:49:34.643]  There's no doubt that the social engineers of this planet have decided to pull out all the stops.
[00:49:34.643 --> 00:49:46.005]  The signposts on the way to that, the signposts illustrating that are legion.
[00:49:46.005 --> 00:49:53.107]  But when I think about the nerve of the VA
[00:49:55.111 --> 00:50:22.371]  Twelve years ago, in 1999, signing now public, but then secret, deals to take all the death benefits from World War II through to today, and through fraud, to have the troops pay into life insurance policies, but then when they die, to not have it paid to their widows or widowers.
[00:50:24.462 --> 00:50:34.909]  Ladies and gentlemen, can you wrap your brain around the fact that that is in mainstream news and no one even gets in trouble?
[00:50:34.909 --> 00:50:43.554]  I mean, can you wrap your mind around the fact that they know depleted uranium is a death sentence for our troops?
[00:50:43.554 --> 00:50:45.275]  20 years ago, they didn't let the troops use it.
[00:50:45.275 --> 00:50:46.916]  Why do they let them use it now?
[00:50:46.916 --> 00:50:49.938]  They don't care.
[00:50:49.938 --> 00:50:52.820]  It's like the globalists are self-destructive nutcases.
[00:50:54.997 --> 00:50:57.639]  They are out of control.
[00:50:57.639 --> 00:51:02.742]  Your calls are coming up.
[00:51:02.742 --> 00:51:03.983]  This is not a drill.
[00:51:03.983 --> 00:51:05.845]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[00:51:08.377 --> 00:51:15.600]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:19.982]  Now, a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[00:51:19.982 --> 00:51:30.307]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them, how to create the perfect hiding place, as well as the places you should never hide your guns.
[00:51:30.487 --> 00:51:32.128]  Under any circumstance.
[00:51:32.128 --> 00:51:39.331]  These and other closely guarded gun cashing secrets are guaranteed to keep your weapons safe and out of sight when the going gets tough.
[00:51:39.331 --> 00:51:40.052]  But listen up.
[00:51:40.052 --> 00:51:46.255]  For security reasons, the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time.
[00:51:46.255 --> 00:51:48.096]  Go to hideyourguns.com.
[00:51:48.096 --> 00:51:50.277]  That's hideyourguns.com.
[00:51:50.277 --> 00:51:50.777]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[00:51:50.777 --> 00:51:52.598]  Before they come for your guns.
[00:51:52.598 --> 00:51:53.058]  Hideyourguns.com.
[00:51:53.058 --> 00:51:53.318]  Right now.
[00:52:00.413 --> 00:52:02.775]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:52:02.775 --> 00:52:05.097]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:52:05.097 --> 00:52:08.319]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:08.319 --> 00:52:13.423]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:13.423 --> 00:52:17.607]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:17.927 --> 00:52:20.268]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:20.268 --> 00:52:23.149]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:23.149 --> 00:52:26.071]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:26.071 --> 00:52:33.674]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:34.013 --> 00:52:39.398]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:39.398 --> 00:52:42.261]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:42.261 --> 00:52:45.945]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:45.945 --> 00:52:47.026]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:47.026 --> 00:52:48.367]  You're everyone else.
[00:52:48.367 --> 00:52:49.848]  Invisible Empire.

[00:54:13.795 --> 00:54:19.398]  Liberty, freedom is such a precious jewel.
[00:54:19.398 --> 00:54:23.940]  And it's very hard to attain, but it's very, very easy to lose.
[00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:40.605]  And more and more, I realize the bedrock of our problems is that we have been beguiled by the Hollywood culture, the TV culture, the issues of little or no significance.
[00:54:40.605 --> 00:54:54.050]  We've been given things that really don't have value, and we've been taught that those things have value, so that while we're chasing after the glitter, while we're chasing after the gold dust,
[00:54:55.051 --> 00:55:04.442]  The real things that really do matter like family and private property and the right to self-defense are being eroded.
[00:55:04.442 --> 00:55:06.425]  All right, let's go back to your calls now.
[00:55:06.425 --> 00:55:09.809]  Will, Muhammad, Scott, Steven, Al.
[00:55:09.809 --> 00:55:12.492]  I know we've been having Max Keiser on a lot because he's been in the Middle East.
[00:55:12.492 --> 00:55:14.575]  He's going to be popping back in and Wayne Madsen.
[00:55:16.550 --> 00:55:19.951]  Again, if you just joined us, and if I sound a bit slow today, I'm still sick.
[00:55:19.951 --> 00:55:22.291]  I have the flu, I believe.
[00:55:22.291 --> 00:55:23.651]  But I'm here.
[00:55:23.651 --> 00:55:26.432]  I should be completely better by tomorrow.
[00:55:26.432 --> 00:55:28.332]  Let's go ahead and talk to Will in New York.
[00:55:28.332 --> 00:55:30.112]  Will, you're on the air.
[00:55:30.112 --> 00:55:31.053]  Hey, Alex.
[00:55:31.053 --> 00:55:32.613]  First, I want to say a couple things.
[00:55:32.613 --> 00:55:41.774]  First, let me say that to all the listeners, if they haven't done it today already, get yourself a couple facts about 9-11, and just go out, you know, keep talking to people.
[00:55:41.774 --> 00:55:45.315]  Anybody who doesn't know the facts, you know, just keep pushing it, because I really feel like
[00:55:45.874 --> 00:55:49.217]  It's one of the most important things that we can do as Americans.
[00:55:49.217 --> 00:55:54.781]  Yeah, 9-11 is the bedrock of their entire takeover and that's why The Global has staged it.
[00:55:54.781 --> 00:55:57.483]  Uh, okay.
[00:55:57.483 --> 00:56:11.314]  So, just that and, uh, well, you know, I thought it was interesting how, uh, Clinton mentioned Russia today, but, you know, I don't watch a lot of TV or listen to a lot of, like, mainstream media, but I saw a lot about Al Jazeera in the media.
[00:56:11.314 --> 00:56:13.836]  I didn't see anything about Russia today and I think it
[00:56:14.209 --> 00:56:18.110]  Part of the reason is because they talk about 9-11 truth a lot.
[00:56:18.110 --> 00:56:21.611]  I mean, I've seen a lot of stuff with you, a lot of stuff about 9-11 truth.
[00:56:21.611 --> 00:56:39.235]  No, no, Al Jazeera is heavily connected to British intelligence and is being used to foment these revolutions all over the Middle East, but then selectively not foment revolution in the country where it's based, Qatar, Qatar.
[00:56:40.936 --> 00:56:45.762]  I just wanted to leave a few comments on the whole situation that's going on right now in the Middle East.
[00:56:58.269 --> 00:57:07.152]  Um, I, I, these things have been going on for a long time and it's interesting right now how they're just, uh, really, you know, cementing it right now as, you know, revolution.
[00:57:07.152 --> 00:57:18.255]  These things, like, there's always been these outcries against the government and just, like, for this to be, like, broadcasted right now in our media, I feel like it's kind of just to detail it away from what's going on here in North America.
[00:57:18.775 --> 00:57:21.037]  That's another great point.
[00:57:21.037 --> 00:57:26.662]  But our government's telling us the economy's great, the economy's wonderful, and there's no inflation either, and everything's fine.
[00:57:26.662 --> 00:57:30.245]  But remember what Lindsey Williams said four months ago.
[00:57:47.853 --> 00:57:50.135]  Yeah, I just wanted to plug in a few things.
[00:57:50.135 --> 00:57:52.278]  TopDocumentaryFilms.com is a really good site.
[00:58:05.743 --> 00:58:06.403]  Okay, wonderful.
[00:58:06.403 --> 00:58:06.983]  Thank you for the call.
[00:58:06.983 --> 00:58:08.444]  We're going to come back and take a bunch of calls.
[00:58:25.148 --> 00:58:28.489]  The number of health care reform law waivers climbs above 1,000.
[00:58:28.489 --> 00:58:30.230]  It's now above 1,400.
[00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:34.411]  If you're an insider, you don't have to get the insurance.
[00:58:34.411 --> 00:58:37.832]  Also, they're getting us ready for rolling blackouts.
[00:58:37.832 --> 00:58:39.473]  All of us are North Koreans now.
[00:58:39.473 --> 00:58:48.176]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:51.122 --> 00:58:54.765]  You may be arrested, and you're subject to other police action.
[00:58:54.765 --> 00:58:56.025]  Tyranny is here.
[00:58:56.025 --> 00:58:59.668]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:58:59.668 --> 00:59:02.189]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:59:02.189 --> 00:59:08.053]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:59:08.053 --> 00:59:14.297]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:59:14.717 --> 00:59:20.661]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:59:20.661 --> 00:59:24.864]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:59:24.864 --> 00:59:29.167]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:59:29.167 --> 00:59:35.112]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:59:35.112 --> 00:59:38.674]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:59:38.674 --> 00:59:40.635]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:59:40.635 --> 00:59:41.076]  It's here.

[01:00:05.305 --> 01:00:10.151]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.151 --> 01:00:11.733]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.733 --> 01:00:13.655]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.655 --> 01:00:17.480]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:21.524]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.599 --> 01:00:26.040]  Hey Alex, you know I've been listening to you for
[01:00:53.131 --> 01:00:54.132]  A few years.
[01:00:54.132 --> 01:00:56.313]  I'm a first-time caller.
[01:00:56.313 --> 01:01:05.000]  And, uh, you know, I've seen these rolling blackouts coming a while back.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:10.385]  And, uh, you know, I went ahead and got myself off the grid.
[01:01:10.385 --> 01:01:13.227]  And, uh, solar and wind power.
[01:01:13.227 --> 01:01:15.609]  But it wasn't just to save money.
[01:01:17.406 --> 01:01:22.268]  You know, our light bill or anything is to get ready for what's coming down the pike, as you well know.
[01:01:22.268 --> 01:01:25.209]  Yeah, I'm trying to move to solar myself.
[01:01:25.209 --> 01:01:33.032]  For people who don't understand this, the globalists are going to use environmental rules, they've stated this, to shut down most of the power plants.
[01:01:33.032 --> 01:01:35.713]  Only a few that they own are going to be able to operate.
[01:01:35.713 --> 01:01:39.554]  And they'll supply a lot less electricity at a higher price.
[01:01:39.554 --> 01:01:41.915]  It's called artificial scarcity.
[01:01:41.915 --> 01:01:44.096]  And it gives them the power over you.
[01:01:44.096 --> 01:01:45.897]  Dictators are always obsessed
[01:01:46.457 --> 01:01:48.939]  With limiting the amount of electricity you get.
[01:01:48.939 --> 01:01:51.080]  It's all part of their control.
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:57.845]  And so they're now announcing in the US, Europe, and England that they are gonna not be giving us power at night now.
[01:01:57.845 --> 01:02:04.169]  And the head of the Energy Department announced hundreds and hundreds of plants to be shut down.
[01:02:04.169 --> 01:02:05.010]  It's totally sick.
[01:02:06.562 --> 01:02:09.024]  Where do these smart meters play in?
[01:02:09.024 --> 01:02:12.406]  Oh, smart meters go together like a horse and carriage.
[01:02:12.406 --> 01:02:23.212]  They said, well, during power restrictions, because there won't be enough power, because there's not enough power plants, they'll decide you can't have your house at 80, it's going to have to be at 90.
[01:02:23.212 --> 01:02:28.475]  Or they're going to turn your power on and off, and they admit this, and they're going in all over the country.
[01:02:28.475 --> 01:02:31.397]  Again, imagine somebody 20 years ago, if you told them,
[01:02:32.463 --> 01:02:36.667]  In America, the government is going to control your thermostat.
[01:02:36.667 --> 01:02:37.948]  You would laugh at them.
[01:02:37.948 --> 01:02:43.472]  But now, if you're against the government turning your thermostat on and off, you get laughed at by the yuppies.
[01:02:43.472 --> 01:02:46.535]  They're like, rolling blackouts are freedom!
[01:02:46.535 --> 01:02:49.357]  Having the government run my thermostat is freedom!
[01:02:49.757 --> 01:02:54.401]  Having telescreens telling me to spy on my neighbors in Walmart is freedom!
[01:02:54.401 --> 01:02:58.844]  Having the government try to make me take forced inoculations is freedom!
[01:02:58.844 --> 01:03:01.867]  Having my IQ lower is freedom!
[01:03:01.867 --> 01:03:04.809]  Having cancer rates explode is freedom!
[01:03:04.809 --> 01:03:07.191]  Taking the pension funds is freedom!
[01:03:07.191 --> 01:03:08.312]  We like it!
[01:03:08.312 --> 01:03:09.673]  We love it!
[01:03:09.673 --> 01:03:11.854]  And so I'm like, yuppies, enjoy yourselves.
[01:03:11.854 --> 01:03:14.316]  You're gonna get all the blessings of globalism.
[01:03:14.316 --> 01:03:16.258]  All the blessings of being stylish and cool.
[01:03:17.472 --> 01:03:22.984]  Well, they've had years and years to destroy their brain cells, so I guess they're reaping the harvest now.
[01:03:36.149 --> 01:03:39.052]  Those damn globalists, I tell you what.
[01:03:39.052 --> 01:03:43.577]  Them whether as they want to call it geoengineering, I'll just call it chemtrails.
[01:03:43.577 --> 01:03:46.060]  They sure are making it hard on me, thank you.
[01:03:46.060 --> 01:03:49.243]  See those clouds up in the sky?
[01:03:49.243 --> 01:03:52.207]  Where my panels are really having to work overtime.
[01:03:52.207 --> 01:03:54.029]  That's why I'm glad I got a windmill.
[01:03:54.821 --> 01:04:02.930]  Well, I tell you one thing, you can skin a buck, you can run a trot line, a country boy can survive, because you can't starve us out and you can't make us run.
[01:04:02.930 --> 01:04:06.975]  I tell you, you are the type of person the globalists hate, Scott, and I love you.
[01:04:06.975 --> 01:04:10.199]  Good to hear from you.
[01:04:10.199 --> 01:04:11.480]  Yeah, I remember about 16 years ago, 1995,
[01:04:14.585 --> 01:04:23.267]  Started getting the reports from environmental scientists and others that they were doing the water test and test on Mount Shasta, you name it.
[01:04:23.267 --> 01:04:30.248]  Suddenly there was aluminum dioxide, barium salts, and other weather modification chemicals in high amounts in it.
[01:04:30.248 --> 01:04:36.850]  And then scientists reverse engineered, we reverse engineered, that it was chemtrails.
[01:04:36.850 --> 01:04:38.470]  And now they have it in the USA today.
[01:04:39.824 --> 01:04:44.957]  Oh yeah, we're mixing with the jet fuel to block out the solar radiation to stop global warming.
[01:04:44.957 --> 01:04:47.142]  It's a big secret program.
[01:04:47.142 --> 01:04:48.506]  Don't worry about it.
[01:04:48.506 --> 01:04:48.967]  Enjoy it.
[01:04:49.895 --> 01:04:52.396]  I mean, can you imagine the power trip the globalists are on?
[01:04:52.396 --> 01:04:54.776]  They've got 30 to 50 year advanced technology.
[01:04:54.776 --> 01:04:56.736]  Lord knows what they've got.
[01:04:56.736 --> 01:04:57.897]  And we're just in the way now.
[01:04:57.897 --> 01:05:00.557]  They want us out of the way so they can have it all to themselves.
[01:05:00.557 --> 01:05:04.398]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.

[01:06:00.301 --> 01:06:04.847]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:06:04.847 --> 01:06:09.193]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:06:09.193 --> 01:06:09.674]  Number two,
[01:06:10.034 --> 01:06:14.936]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:06:14.936 --> 01:06:15.677]  It's true.
[01:06:15.677 --> 01:06:21.380]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:24.961]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:06:24.961 --> 01:06:29.664]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:06:29.664 --> 01:06:32.425]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:06:32.425 --> 01:06:35.767]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:06:36.107 --> 01:06:41.028]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:06:41.028 --> 01:06:46.090]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:08:05.407 --> 01:08:10.229]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:08:10.229 --> 01:08:11.829]  You want answers?
[01:08:11.829 --> 01:08:13.370]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.370 --> 01:08:17.571]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.571 --> 01:08:21.613]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:23.835 --> 01:08:30.162]  It is abundantly clear that the globalists are trying to trigger a destabilization campaign in the Middle East, North Africa.
[01:08:30.162 --> 01:08:38.210]  It is 100% confirmed that they are triggering the revolt against Muammar Gaddafi, the overthrow of Hussein Mubarak.
[01:08:38.210 --> 01:08:46.458]  Now Saudi Arabia is into two weeks of riots and banning protests and tanks driving around, tear-gassing people.
[01:08:47.319 --> 01:08:50.982]  I mean, this is getting crazier and crazier by the minute.
[01:08:50.982 --> 01:09:03.434]  And the underlying cause is dollar devaluation, increasing food prices worldwide, because every major currency is pegged to the dollar.
[01:09:03.434 --> 01:09:13.122]  And meanwhile, the IMF and World Bank have been going into these countries and pressuring them to cut food stamps, to cut food allotments.
[01:09:14.190 --> 01:09:17.111]  Knowing that that will even exacerbate it more.
[01:09:17.111 --> 01:09:22.553]  Then they send in their people to trigger rebels trying to overthrow the government.
[01:09:22.553 --> 01:09:28.216]  And that's why Muammar Gaddafi says Al Qaeda is behind the chaos.
[01:09:28.216 --> 01:09:37.299]  And he says that people trained who were held at Guantanamo Bay, thousands have been held there on and off again, are the ones leading the attack.
[01:09:37.299 --> 01:09:39.600]  Well, that actually fits with what we've seen in other nations.
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:43.002]  They quote, get these people, brainwash them, train them,
[01:09:44.585 --> 01:09:48.088]  Prepare them and then send them out.
[01:09:48.088 --> 01:09:53.371]  But then you tell the average American, hey, Al-Qaeda works for our government, even though the evidence is overwhelming.
[01:09:53.371 --> 01:09:56.113]  They're like, oh, sure it does.
[01:09:56.113 --> 01:09:56.734]  It's incredible.
[01:09:56.734 --> 01:10:07.622]  I mean, who would ever imagine that it was something that sounds so crazy?
[01:10:07.622 --> 01:10:13.506]  But if you look at the history of it, they used Al-Qaeda to overthrow the Serbs in Kosovo.
[01:10:14.611 --> 01:10:15.072]  Yeah, hey Alex.
[01:10:15.072 --> 01:10:17.254]  You know, I was thinking about
[01:10:38.698 --> 01:10:52.890]  Everything that we're up against in this battle with the globalists, and, you know, to me, you got it nailed on the head with the subtitle of your site, where it says, there's a war on for your mind.
[01:10:52.890 --> 01:11:06.120]  And, you know, this is the thing I find is the number one obstacle that we're up against, because there's so much psychological warfare going on, and the average American, they have no clue as to what this is.
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:08.162]  You know, I'll say to people all the time,
[01:11:08.929 --> 01:11:10.271]  Look at TV.
[01:11:10.271 --> 01:11:11.493]  And I get the same response.
[01:11:11.493 --> 01:11:14.778]  I say, why do you think they call it programming?
[01:11:14.778 --> 01:11:16.200]  And they'll laugh.
[01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:19.325]  And then all of a sudden it's like this light clicks on and they go, you know, you're right.
[01:11:20.308 --> 01:11:30.076]  And, you know, you pointed out about the device itself with the flicker effect and how now they're finding early Alzheimer's in people because of it shutting down your brain and putting it in sleep mode.
[01:11:30.076 --> 01:11:34.940]  And by the way, we've got Dr. Nick Begichon tomorrow just on this subject.
[01:11:34.940 --> 01:11:44.728]  The hundreds of patents confirming that they cannot just lower your IQ, lower your overall cognitive ability, or lower your overall brainwaves.
[01:11:44.728 --> 01:11:47.310]  They can actually program you
[01:11:48.451 --> 01:11:55.576]  And they can manipulate the physiology of the body with these systems.
[01:11:55.576 --> 01:12:09.325]  And we have a culture for 50 years that watches 5, 6, 7 hours of TV a day, not just with the overt message of the programming, but also the overall subliminal messages.
[01:12:09.325 --> 01:12:18.011]  That's why the average yuppie automatically giggles at you when you bring this up to them, because they're in a dreamlike, trance-like state.
[01:12:19.291 --> 01:12:20.832]  Right, yeah, you're exactly right.
[01:12:20.832 --> 01:12:26.333]  You know, I've just really been trying to talk to people about this, because here's what I see.
[01:12:26.333 --> 01:12:28.813]  What this all comes down to, it's eugenics.
[01:12:28.813 --> 01:12:44.357]  Now, you pointed out all the stuff about, you know, then the food and the water and how they're spraying us, so they're physically, they're incrementally making us sick and trying to kill us, but it's the more deeper thing, because it's so much more subtle and stealth-like.
[01:12:44.761 --> 01:12:48.298]  And that is the psychological propaganda and the whole...
[01:12:49.383 --> 01:13:02.772]  Well, that's what I was thinking last night whenever I was watching the Battle for the Pacific newsreels, was it was the same way the military systematically encircled the Japanese.
[01:13:02.772 --> 01:13:04.934]  That's what the globalists are doing to us.
[01:13:04.934 --> 01:13:11.158]  They systematically roll forward, creeping, running their programs.
[01:13:11.158 --> 01:13:18.443]  They're basically adding toxins in our food, water, air to dumb us down so that we're basically so brain damaged
[01:13:19.023 --> 01:13:19.223]  I think?
[01:13:35.532 --> 01:13:55.268]  That then people will expect this as almost prophecy or a foregone conclusion, because in all the high schools and junior highs and TV and everywhere, they're teaching us that it's beautiful that man is soon going to be extinct, and that it's a foregone conclusion, that it's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[01:13:55.268 --> 01:13:59.071]  And so the globalists are going ahead with this plan.
[01:14:00.277 --> 01:14:13.465]  I know about it, you know about it, they've written their plan, but how do you get brain-damaged, and also chemically, but also electronically, mind-controlled people to hear what you're saying?
[01:14:13.465 --> 01:14:20.089]  Or even if you can wake them up, then how do you get them to have enough respect in themselves to believe that they can resist this?
[01:14:20.089 --> 01:14:24.131]  I mean, listen, you talk about conformity, Steve.
[01:14:24.131 --> 01:14:28.454]  I had a New York Magazine reporter here last week,
[01:14:29.795 --> 01:14:35.438]  And when I talked about Bohemian Grove and Luciferianism, he started laughing at me.
[01:14:35.438 --> 01:14:44.583]  And I said, well, even if you don't believe in God and the devil, you know, they do take it serious at Bohemian Grove, but he still thought it was funny.
[01:14:44.583 --> 01:14:47.544]  You know, to him, it was funny.
[01:14:47.544 --> 01:14:50.646]  And, well, finish your point, and I'm gonna make a point.
[01:14:50.646 --> 01:14:50.946]  Go ahead.
[01:14:51.704 --> 01:14:57.286]  Well, I was just going to say, you know, you're talking about the way people react because of their program, their condition.
[01:14:57.286 --> 01:15:15.471]  I remember years ago, being in a defensive driving class, and the other day I had this segment on drunk driving that they always show, and these kids were sitting there, you know, I was older than most, and most were teens, but they're showing about these two little girls who had gotten permanently disabled in an accident caused by a drunk driver.
[01:15:15.471 --> 01:15:17.872]  And these people sitting in the room are laughing.
[01:15:18.689 --> 01:15:22.110]  And I'm just thinking, what is there funny about that?
[01:15:22.110 --> 01:15:27.671]  And yet, they just think it's a joke, because, and here's what I think it is, you're talking about solution.
[01:15:27.671 --> 01:15:35.352]  And this is one reason the Tea Party movement happened, and you know, on and on and on, but people are seeing things now coming closer and closer to their door.
[01:15:35.352 --> 01:15:39.553]  Unfortunately in America, we live by the mindset, out of sight, out of mind.
[01:15:39.553 --> 01:15:43.073]  As long as it doesn't come to my door, I don't have to deal with it.
[01:15:43.073 --> 01:15:46.714]  I think people are starting to get really scared, they can't put their finger on what's going on.
[01:15:47.236 --> 01:16:00.683]  They know something's up, and if people like you and me that have the right information can come on and appeal to them on a human level that they can emotionally relate to as well as psychologically, that may be enough of a spark to wake them up.
[01:16:00.683 --> 01:16:06.405]  Because, you know, we're all humans, and we can all live in relation to each other, but I'm like you, Alex.
[01:16:06.405 --> 01:16:11.708]  I look at this, and sometimes you scratch your head and go, man, what is it going to take to wake some of these people up?
[01:16:12.301 --> 01:16:14.623]  Well, wonderful call, Steve.
[01:16:14.623 --> 01:16:18.765]  Please call back, because you really laid it all out crystal clear.
[01:16:18.765 --> 01:16:26.771]  I've told the story about World War II vets and people who didn't like watching violent movies.
[01:16:26.771 --> 01:16:29.432]  And it wasn't because they were wimps.
[01:16:29.432 --> 01:16:37.758]  It was because they'd been involved in reality, and so they didn't think watching somebody get chopped up or tortured to death was funny.
[01:16:39.676 --> 01:17:05.809]  Meanwhile, you take a domesticated, decadent, weak teenager, who's had everything handed to him in life, and they go watch a movie like Saw or Hostel, where people are being tortured to death and being killed, and it's so cool, it's so wonderful, the torturers are even moral, they have some weird reason they're doing it, and they sit there and giggle and laugh at it.
[01:17:07.133 --> 01:17:15.237]  And it's just like people that sit there and giggle and laugh at seeing disabled children.
[01:17:15.237 --> 01:17:20.480]  It's very fashionable online now to abuse animals.
[01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:32.266]  There's all sorts of videos everywhere of the compliment of a good-looking woman kind of kicking a dog or being mean to a cat or something like that, and people get off on that.
[01:17:32.266 --> 01:17:34.668]  They're self-hating at a core level
[01:17:35.993 --> 01:17:47.015]  As Victor Hugo said, adversity makes men, prosperity makes monsters.
[01:17:47.015 --> 01:17:51.936]  And so this always happens in societal cultural cycles.
[01:17:51.936 --> 01:17:55.237]  People then want to be destroyed.
[01:17:55.237 --> 01:17:56.797]  They want to go into bondage.
[01:17:56.797 --> 01:17:59.198]  They want to laugh at evil.
[01:17:59.198 --> 01:18:01.498]  They want to laugh at corruption.
[01:18:01.498 --> 01:18:03.639]  They want to make a joke out of everything.
[01:18:05.114 --> 01:18:07.675]  And don't worry, they will get hurt.
[01:18:07.675 --> 01:18:12.137]  And then once they're in the jaws of the tyranny, then they're gonna squeal.
[01:18:12.137 --> 01:18:15.579]  Then they're gonna beg and plead.
[01:18:15.579 --> 01:18:21.641]  But never until they've actually reached that point, because they haven't lived in reality.
[01:18:21.641 --> 01:18:27.624]  And never have we had a population more divorced from reality.
[01:18:27.624 --> 01:18:33.827]  More separated, more disconnected.
[01:18:35.689 --> 01:18:47.338]  Sure, you've got lots of people that are waking up, but those that aren't waking up are getting deeper into their delusion.
[01:18:47.338 --> 01:18:52.802]  And people go through these cycles.
[01:18:52.802 --> 01:18:56.585]  I don't wanna talk more about Charlie Sheen, but you can search the term.
[01:18:56.585 --> 01:19:02.069]  Charlie Sheen says he's a born-again Christian, and you can see him in the mid-1990s become a born-again Christian.
[01:19:03.038 --> 01:19:10.724]  And I remember just being in his house like six years ago and him talking about God and our God-given rights and being a Christian.
[01:19:10.724 --> 01:19:24.874]  And then he goes off the rails for seven months and now he's come off the drugs and he's running around basically embracing deviltry.
[01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:31.332]  And that's kind of what the culture's done.
[01:19:31.332 --> 01:19:35.234]  That's why so many in the culture identify with what Charlie Sheen's doing.
[01:19:35.234 --> 01:19:38.116]  He's just my friend I hope gets better.
[01:19:38.116 --> 01:19:42.558]  I mean, I see killing a million Iraqis as evil or abortion as evil.
[01:19:42.558 --> 01:19:48.061]  I don't think Charlie... I don't sit there and judge him.
[01:19:48.061 --> 01:19:51.043]  I worry about him.
[01:19:51.043 --> 01:19:52.824]  But again, I'm a bit out of it today, folks.
[01:19:52.824 --> 01:19:54.785]  Coming off the flu.
[01:19:54.785 --> 01:19:57.026]  More of your phone calls than Wayne Madsen coming up.
[01:19:58.524 --> 01:19:59.016]  Stay with us.
[01:20:00.779 --> 01:20:07.382]  Don't you just laugh every time the news plays another story about a foreclosure bank or attorney under investigation, bankrupted or being sued?
[01:20:07.382 --> 01:20:13.165]  Zero Debt has a program that stops foreclosure, guaranteed for at least two years, without payments or attorneys.
[01:20:13.165 --> 01:20:18.828]  In fact, we show our members how to get the banks to pay their taxes and insurance while they stonewall the bank's collection process.
[01:20:18.828 --> 01:20:23.590]  We show you how it's possible to quiet the title in your name by using the bank's very own foreclosure process.
[01:20:23.590 --> 01:20:25.171]  Loan modification is a joke.
[01:20:25.171 --> 01:20:28.773]  The banks use that to take your money with nothing in return and keeping you in default.
[01:20:28.973 --> 01:20:30.134]  You've heard our ad before.
[01:20:30.134 --> 01:20:32.975]  We are not investors, bankers, attorneys, or real estate agents.
[01:20:32.975 --> 01:20:36.396]  We are a group of people just like you that are sick and tired of the housing crash.
[01:20:36.396 --> 01:20:39.658]  And we've helped thousands avoid foreclosure since 1993.

[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:45.521]  We're good to go.
[01:21:08.752 --> 01:21:09.252]  We're good to go.
[01:21:34.105 --> 01:21:40.391]  He was among the first to predict the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:21:40.391 --> 01:21:43.214]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:21:43.214 --> 01:21:46.657]  If you haven't taken time to watch this free video, do it right now.
[01:21:46.657 --> 01:21:48.919]  You may never think about America the same way again.

[01:22:01.311 --> 01:22:02.332]  Gold isn't for you?
[01:22:02.332 --> 01:22:07.856]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[01:22:07.856 --> 01:22:08.396]  I get it.
[01:22:08.396 --> 01:22:18.024]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[01:22:18.024 --> 01:22:19.445]  That's not what's happening.
[01:22:19.445 --> 01:22:27.911]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[01:22:27.911 --> 01:22:31.154]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[01:22:31.274 --> 01:22:35.558]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[01:22:35.558 --> 01:22:37.159]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[01:22:37.159 --> 01:22:41.122]  dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[01:22:41.122 --> 01:22:44.946]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[01:22:44.946 --> 01:22:45.847]  You should, too.
[01:22:45.847 --> 01:22:46.987]  Find out what they know.
[01:22:46.987 --> 01:22:50.310]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[01:22:50.310 --> 01:22:50.370]  800-686-2237.
[01:22:50.370 --> 01:22:50.711]  800-686-2237.
[01:22:50.711 --> 01:22:50.891]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:23:00.478 --> 01:23:06.943]  This message starts with a great offer from Big Berkey Water Filters because we don't want you drinking dangerous water one minute longer.

[01:24:23.564 --> 01:24:26.325]  I mean, let's face it, we're a sick society.
[01:24:26.325 --> 01:24:31.247]  We've aborted 51 million babies because it's easy for us to do.
[01:24:31.247 --> 01:24:34.128]  We just say they're not humans.
[01:24:34.128 --> 01:24:41.970]  So why not go ahead and let the troops use depleted uranium knowing it's a death sentence for anyone that uses it?
[01:24:41.970 --> 01:24:43.951]  Just say it's not bad.
[01:24:43.951 --> 01:24:45.712]  Why not take the troops' pension funds?
[01:24:45.712 --> 01:24:48.313]  Why not take the general public's pension funds?
[01:24:48.313 --> 01:24:51.994]  Why not devalue the dollar?
[01:24:53.168 --> 01:25:08.452]  There's a bizarre article by a senior Fed economist calling Ron Paul a pinhead, one of the Board of Governors of the, what is it, Kansas City Fed.
[01:25:08.452 --> 01:25:14.574]  And in it, they're calling him a pinhead for saying the Federal Reserve has devalued the dollar.
[01:25:14.574 --> 01:25:19.055]  Well, it's a fact the Federal Reserve has devalued the dollar with its policies.
[01:25:19.055 --> 01:25:21.936]  But see, that's their answer, is just to call Ron Paul a pinhead.
[01:25:25.109 --> 01:25:29.472]  It's a world of delusional thinking.
[01:25:29.472 --> 01:25:33.415]  And the globalists, I believe, are buying into their own thinking.
[01:25:33.415 --> 01:25:36.278]  And they're very nihilistic.
[01:25:36.278 --> 01:25:39.880]  Let's talk to Al in Delaware, then Patrick, Steve, Dana, Bill, and others.
[01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:41.442]  Go ahead, Al.
[01:25:41.442 --> 01:25:42.603]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:25:42.603 --> 01:25:43.884]  I hope you're feeling better, buddy.
[01:25:43.884 --> 01:25:45.545]  Get a little water and chicken soup.
[01:25:45.545 --> 01:25:52.670]  Hey, look, a lot of this is aimed at the 77 million baby boomers getting ready to come into retirement.
[01:25:52.670 --> 01:25:54.652]  They are stealing our wealth.
[01:25:55.450 --> 01:26:04.035]  What's better to do to the enemy than weaken them, tear them down systematically, and this has been going on for 40 years.
[01:26:04.035 --> 01:26:14.702]  Obama is the most dangerous person in the White House, or I should say his administration, and when are people going to get it?
[01:26:14.702 --> 01:26:24.868]  It is not going to fare well for the people that lift up their feet and ride along with the crowd, think they're groovy because they hate industry,
[01:26:25.786 --> 01:26:29.108]  It is going to be catastrophic.
[01:26:29.108 --> 01:26:30.209]  What's your take?
[01:26:30.209 --> 01:26:31.090]  Well, you just said it.
[01:26:31.090 --> 01:26:32.691]  I mean, they think they're groovy.
[01:26:32.691 --> 01:26:39.535]  They think being failures, they think whatever is put out as slick and hip is cool.
[01:26:39.535 --> 01:26:45.620]  I mean, if the government told them eating cyanide was cool, a lot of these people would run out and start gobbling it.
[01:26:46.460 --> 01:26:46.680]  I think?
[01:27:00.646 --> 01:27:05.331]  Dispossessed by design and I just hope we can turn it around.
[01:27:05.331 --> 01:27:10.296]  You know, the good news is anytime the people actually take action, we're having victory.
[01:27:10.296 --> 01:27:13.459]  We're stopping them when it comes to trying to get our guns.
[01:27:13.459 --> 01:27:15.901]  They're starting to restrict abortion in more and more states.
[01:27:16.762 --> 01:27:16.922]  I don't
[01:27:36.425 --> 01:27:48.973]  As long as people are divided along the lines of Republican-Democrat, as long as people don't realize that at the top, Republicans and Democrats are in almost total agreement, as long as people aren't aware of that, Al, it's over.
[01:27:48.973 --> 01:27:49.393]  Anything else?
[01:27:50.370 --> 01:27:53.311]  We're going to need independence in 2012.
[01:27:53.311 --> 01:27:54.771]  Forget the Republicans.
[01:27:54.771 --> 01:27:56.732]  Forget the Democrats, people.
[01:27:56.732 --> 01:27:57.652]  It's over.
[01:27:57.652 --> 01:28:10.935]  You better look at each other and make nice and get strong because it's going to get dark, the wind is going to blow, and you had better have your hatches bolted tight.
[01:28:10.935 --> 01:28:12.275]  See you later, Alex.
[01:28:12.275 --> 01:28:13.616]  Al, well said.
[01:28:13.616 --> 01:28:18.477]  You know, this weekend I was thinking about a way to just simply boil all this down.
[01:28:20.049 --> 01:28:24.330]  And this is basically what we're facing.
[01:28:24.330 --> 01:28:43.996]  As a general public, we're given a false, holographic political projection that has very little to do with reality, and then we basically fight and struggle and argue within that false projection.
[01:28:43.996 --> 01:28:47.376]  Okay?
[01:28:47.376 --> 01:28:49.177]  And within that false projection,
[01:28:52.625 --> 01:29:02.047]  The general public is powerless to ever take control of their own lives, their own destinies.
[01:29:02.047 --> 01:29:19.990]  But past the false political projection, there is a scientific technological elite who has studied human psychology and how we operate that has a global plan to forcibly set up a world government
[01:29:21.423 --> 01:29:27.706]  And to then forcibly carry out massive population reduction.
[01:29:27.706 --> 01:29:34.550]  So far, what we've seen has been beta testing.
[01:29:34.550 --> 01:29:45.455]  But the new systems being deployed, once they've got their control grid in place, once they've got their media system in place, is gonna be massive.
[01:29:45.455 --> 01:29:49.017]  Now, I don't know if they're gonna get away with pulling this off, folks, but they sure are trying.
[01:29:51.021 --> 01:29:54.952]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.952 --> 01:29:57.639]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.986 --> 01:30:05.650]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:30:05.650 --> 01:30:09.254]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:30:09.254 --> 01:30:14.059]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:30:14.059 --> 01:30:20.445]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:30:20.445 --> 01:30:22.688]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:30:23.208 --> 01:30:23.508]  Tim Geithner?
[01:30:23.508 --> 01:30:24.029]  Bernanke?
[01:30:24.029 --> 01:30:24.829]  They're arsonists!
[01:30:24.829 --> 01:30:25.790]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:30:25.790 --> 01:30:28.231]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:30:42.119 --> 01:30:49.387]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:30:49.387 --> 01:30:58.517]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:31:01.886 --> 01:31:08.909]  Alex has told you that the Mideast uprisings over food prices and shortages caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide.
[01:31:08.909 --> 01:31:11.570]  We're seeing the impact right here in the United States.
[01:31:11.570 --> 01:31:20.613]  Ethanol, that was supposed to reduce petroleum use and fuel prices, hit a 30-month high in February, and pump prices are expected to reach $5 a gallon.
[01:31:20.613 --> 01:31:28.877]  Because of shipping costs, food is being priced out of the reach of millions of Americans, with an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days.
[01:31:28.877 --> 01:31:29.957]  Move quickly while you can
[01:31:29.957 --> 01:31:30.477]  We're good to go.
[01:32:00.288 --> 01:32:01.449]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:32:01.449 --> 01:32:08.393]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:32:08.393 --> 01:32:10.935]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:32:10.935 --> 01:32:16.318]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:32:16.318 --> 01:32:19.360]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:21.421]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:32:21.661 --> 01:32:27.923]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:32:27.923 --> 01:32:31.304]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:32:31.304 --> 01:32:37.086]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:32:37.086 --> 01:32:38.727]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:32:38.727 --> 01:32:40.007]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:32:40.007 --> 01:32:42.688]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:32:42.688 --> 01:32:44.109]  He explains everything you need to know.
[01:32:44.369 --> 01:32:46.910]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:32:46.910 --> 01:32:51.532]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[01:32:51.532 --> 01:32:54.113]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[01:32:54.113 --> 01:32:57.995]  Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[01:32:57.995 --> 01:33:03.477]  That's endofamerica3.com.
[01:33:03.477 --> 01:33:07.059]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:33:07.059 --> 01:33:11.221]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:31.337 --> 01:33:39.342]  Okay, Patrick, Steve, Dana, Bill, others, your calls are coming up, and Max Keiser finishing up his trip in the Middle East.
[01:33:39.342 --> 01:33:43.125]  He'll be popping back in a little bit in the next hour.
[01:33:43.125 --> 01:33:45.567]  But I wanted to get Wayne Madsen on.
[01:33:45.567 --> 01:33:57.815]  He's been out in Chicago quite a bit investigating the mob boss Rahm Emanuel with his fixed election out there, where the Obama administration is going.
[01:33:57.815 --> 01:34:00.737]  But before we go there with Wayne Madsen,
[01:34:01.737 --> 01:34:06.039]  Who, by the way, is a Navy veteran.
[01:34:06.039 --> 01:34:08.900]  He also worked with the National Security Agency.
[01:34:08.900 --> 01:34:15.403]  He's been a commentator on Fox News, CNN, RT, you name it.
[01:34:15.403 --> 01:34:19.364]  He's also a senior fellow with the Electronic Privacy Information Center.
[01:34:19.364 --> 01:34:22.946]  WayneMadsenReport.com is his website.
[01:34:22.946 --> 01:34:30.249]  I wanted to get your take on the SAS troops being captured in eastern Libya.
[01:34:31.609 --> 01:34:42.256]  On the evidence that the West was behind at least the initiation of the turmoil in Egypt.
[01:34:42.256 --> 01:34:53.123]  Now the rioting intensifying in places like Saudi Arabia, despite the fact that the King Abdullah pumped out 37 million to the general public.
[01:34:53.123 --> 01:34:56.385]  They're banning protests there.
[01:34:56.385 --> 01:34:59.967]  Obviously, the initiating spark here
[01:35:01.719 --> 01:35:13.749]  Is the situation with dollar devaluation causing food prices to go up in these countries?
[01:35:13.749 --> 01:35:15.950]  But what else is behind this?
[01:35:15.950 --> 01:35:23.517]  I mean, is this staged in your view or what's the larger geopolitical ramifications of this Wayne Madsen?
[01:35:24.394 --> 01:35:32.976]  Well, I think what happened is we saw the Arab uprising not confined to just Tunisia and Egypt.
[01:35:32.976 --> 01:35:51.622]  It spread into Libya, but I think at that point in time we had some outside players deciding, hey, look, although we're cooperating with Qaddafi, there's a bunch of people, holdovers from the old Reagan and Bush 1 administration when Qaddafi was public enemy number one.
[01:35:51.622 --> 01:35:53.102]  They said, oh, this is an excellent chance.
[01:35:53.923 --> 01:35:54.543]  Get rid of him.
[01:35:54.543 --> 01:36:04.189]  And I think Obama and Hillary Clinton are really taking their orders now from a group of multinational oil companies and the CIA.
[01:36:04.189 --> 01:36:09.192]  And we know about MI6 being caught red-handed with that team in eastern Libya.
[01:36:09.192 --> 01:36:14.435]  And now we have a report that Obama has asked the Saudis to provide the Libyan rebels
[01:36:15.055 --> 01:36:15.716]  With weapons.
[01:36:15.716 --> 01:36:23.901]  Now that is absolutely the wrong thing to do, because Gaddafi's been harping on about Al-Qaeda as his major enemy here.
[01:36:23.901 --> 01:36:27.963]  Well, we know that Al-Qaeda was a construct of the Saudis.
[01:36:27.963 --> 01:36:29.264]  They were the financiers.
[01:36:29.264 --> 01:36:41.372]  They were the ones who provided the bodies, along with the CIA, and to some extent the Israelis, back during that whole Mujahideen fiasco in Afghanistan, and we're left with that mess, too.
[01:36:43.188 --> 01:36:46.999]  I heard John McCain on one of the talking head shows talking about
[01:36:48.189 --> 01:36:52.011]  Tal Qaddafi's insane and he was likening him to Hitler.
[01:36:52.011 --> 01:36:53.712]  Well where have we heard that before?
[01:36:53.712 --> 01:36:57.414]  We heard that when they were going after Saddam Hussein.
[01:36:57.414 --> 01:37:02.797]  When in fact it's Insane McCain who I think we can question his mentality.
[01:37:02.797 --> 01:37:03.258]  That's right.
[01:37:03.258 --> 01:37:05.759]  They just retread the same propaganda.
[01:37:05.759 --> 01:37:11.662]  Now they're claiming Iran is going to get yellow cake from an African nation again.
[01:37:11.662 --> 01:37:15.084]  An exact retread of what we heard pre-war 2000.
[01:37:16.900 --> 01:37:32.085]  And here are the Saudis, and that's London Telegraph, being asked to ship in weapons and personnel, obviously, into the East, and they are al-Qaeda, just like they used al-Qaeda to go after the Serbs.
[01:37:32.085 --> 01:37:38.627]  I mean, when are people going to figure this out, that al-Qaeda is basically an MI6-slash-Israeli U.S.
[01:37:38.627 --> 01:37:38.727]  arm?
[01:37:39.685 --> 01:37:40.345]  Absolutely.
[01:37:40.345 --> 01:37:46.367]  And now we have the Saleh regime in Yemen up against the wall with a massive uprising.
[01:37:46.367 --> 01:37:47.987]  And what happened a few days ago?
[01:37:47.987 --> 01:37:51.768]  Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula staged a terrorist attack.
[01:37:51.768 --> 01:37:55.269]  Well, it's clear who's behind these attacks.
[01:37:55.269 --> 01:37:56.950]  It's an effort to shore up
[01:37:57.791 --> 01:38:09.864]  There's a report that the Obama administration has decided they've drawn a line in the sand that may include now some sort of a status quo in Libya.
[01:38:09.864 --> 01:38:17.012]  They don't want to see any more regimes fall, especially the Saudis, where we now have street demonstrations all through
[01:38:17.512 --> 01:38:18.692]  Saudi Arabia.
[01:38:18.692 --> 01:38:38.079]  And it's very clear that the elites who run the oil companies and run the intelligence agencies are going to use the Saudis as this sort of last stopgap measure to try to save these faltering regimes.
[01:38:40.114 --> 01:38:42.935]  But what's the larger geopolitical aim?
[01:38:42.935 --> 01:38:45.677]  I mean, obviously, oil prices are going up.
[01:38:45.677 --> 01:38:59.264]  Our Western media has been spinning things, basically saying that, oh, we're going to have a recession or a depression because of what's happening in the Arab nations.
[01:38:59.264 --> 01:39:03.186]  Is this a political distraction for what's happening here domestically?
[01:39:04.568 --> 01:39:31.719]  I think it's all... I think what we're seeing is a global uprising against, you know, just the way these oligarchs have been treating workers, pensioners, saying, look, you know, these bankers and oligarchs have stolen billions, billions, and trillions of dollars, but, you know, you the guy who walks the beat in Madison, Wisconsin, and you the
[01:39:33.340 --> 01:39:34.121]  I don't know.
[01:39:55.262 --> 01:40:01.525]  As they haven't seen for many years, they see that there's a possibility that people are waking up.
[01:40:01.525 --> 01:40:04.466]  You know, the Arabs are calling this the Great Awakening.
[01:40:04.466 --> 01:40:10.828]  They've been in sort of a coma for so long, having to deal with these Western-imposed regimes.
[01:40:10.828 --> 01:40:13.289]  But I think there's an awakening.
[01:40:13.289 --> 01:40:19.231]  You don't have to be on the Arab street to be experiencing this awakening.
[01:40:19.231 --> 01:40:20.911]  So basically, you're saying that...
[01:40:22.612 --> 01:40:31.043]  This has real organic roots, but the global oligarchs are trying to manipulate these revolutions to keep their people in power.
[01:40:31.900 --> 01:40:32.600]  I think so.
[01:40:32.600 --> 01:40:33.361]  I think so.
[01:40:33.361 --> 01:40:40.524]  And, you know, we saw the regimes that took over from the dictators in Tunisia and Egypt.
[01:40:40.524 --> 01:40:46.127]  They were not a heck of a lot different than what we saw with Mubarak and Ben Ali in those countries.
[01:40:46.127 --> 01:40:48.969]  But now we've seen a lot of replacements.
[01:40:48.969 --> 01:40:55.452]  And, for example, the new foreign minister of Egypt, named just today, is saying, look,
[01:40:56.372 --> 01:40:58.414]  Uh, it's not business as usual.
[01:40:58.414 --> 01:41:02.778]  And he happened to have been one of the demonstrators on career squares.
[01:41:02.778 --> 01:41:13.648]  So now we're seeing people coming into these governments who are committed to change rather than these sort of placeholders that were very much linked with the past regime.
[01:41:15.134 --> 01:41:16.515]  How do you see this ending?
[01:41:16.515 --> 01:41:23.582]  I mean, as you said, this is happening in Eastern Europe, Greece, Ireland, starting to spread here to the United States.
[01:41:23.582 --> 01:41:28.607]  How do you see this ending, and how do you see the globalists trying to respond to this global awakening?
[01:41:28.607 --> 01:41:30.029]  A new world war?
[01:41:31.095 --> 01:41:33.337]  Well, of course, they'll try anything.
[01:41:33.337 --> 01:41:42.146]  We may see an increase in terrorist attacks like we've already seen with this phony construct called Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula that's taken place in Yemen.
[01:41:42.146 --> 01:41:45.169]  I've been talking to some people familiar with Saudi Arabia.
[01:41:45.169 --> 01:41:47.991]  The South will pull that rabbit out of their hat, too.
[01:41:47.991 --> 01:41:52.496]  You may see some terrorist attacks in, for example, the oil-rich eastern province.
[01:41:52.976 --> 01:41:57.600]  Which has two million Shias demanding some rights.
[01:41:57.600 --> 01:42:00.402]  We may see some sort of staged event there.
[01:42:00.402 --> 01:42:08.810]  We know that the Maliki government in Baghdad is now up against the wall because these people are in the streets demonstrating there.
[01:42:08.810 --> 01:42:18.298]  And that this puppet regime, of course, is still being protected by, you know, thousands of, tens of thousands of American troops.
[01:42:18.298 --> 01:42:21.020]  And, of course, Maliki is also pulling the al Qaeda.
[01:42:21.580 --> 01:42:23.682]  But at the same time, there's some truth to it.
[01:42:23.682 --> 01:42:26.984]  Not the public Al-Qaeda, but the Saudi-slash-US-British-Israeli-backed Al-Qaeda.
[01:42:48.154 --> 01:42:48.754]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:42:48.754 --> 01:42:49.995]  I think they're one and the same.
[01:42:49.995 --> 01:43:04.366]  I think Al Qaeda, from the very beginning, going back to what the late Foreign Secretary of Britain, Robin Cook, said, look, Al Qaeda is nothing more than a CIA database of financiers, you know, people... Sure, I mean, I understand that, but I'm saying...
[01:43:05.362 --> 01:43:14.813]  I was getting from what you're saying that Qaddafi's making up an al-Qaeda threat, but then I was adding, but the Saudis are being asked to bring weapons and things in.
[01:43:14.813 --> 01:43:16.755]  Wouldn't that be a real al-Qaeda threat?
[01:43:16.755 --> 01:43:20.400]  It's just that it's not the al-Qaeda the public's told about, it's the real al-Qaeda.
[01:43:20.860 --> 01:43:34.606]  Right, I think Qaddafi, and this is, now what we've seen because they caught those British guys, they caught some Dutch commandos, we know about this now, this Saudi arrangement is being talked about in the media.
[01:43:34.606 --> 01:43:41.409]  I think this is, we've seen al-Qaddafi going on offensive, where he was really, I think, up against the wall.
[01:43:42.029 --> 01:43:42.249]  I think?
[01:43:52.626 --> 01:44:02.508]  Anyone who was sitting on the fence in Libya, maybe thinking, well, let's hold our finger up to the wind and see which way the wind is blowing, now sees it going in Qaddafi's favor.
[01:44:02.508 --> 01:44:05.589]  And I think he's got it renewed, of course.
[01:44:05.589 --> 01:44:07.469]  And that's why McCain is panicking.
[01:44:07.469 --> 01:44:10.590]  That's why Senator Kerry's panicking.
[01:44:10.590 --> 01:44:13.931]  Did you see the Senator Kerry video clip today where he said,
[01:44:14.571 --> 01:44:19.500]  None of us want military intervention or military action, and we all agree that shouldn't happen.
[01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:24.588]  That's why we should only bomb their airfields and have a no-fly zone, which is not a military action.
[01:44:25.578 --> 01:44:33.747]  Right, I saw that, and you know, I mean, you look at Kerry and McCain and Lindsey Graham, these guys who, you know, are talking about military action.
[01:44:33.747 --> 01:44:35.970]  Well, why don't they suit up and go over there, you know?
[01:44:35.970 --> 01:44:39.574]  I mean, you know, let McCain get into an F-40.
[01:44:39.574 --> 01:44:46.762]  Yeah, but what about the Orwellian statement that bombing airfields and no-fly zones are not military action?
[01:44:47.483 --> 01:44:48.964]  Of course they are.
[01:44:48.964 --> 01:44:58.749]  We have a past with the Reagan administration when he launched attacks on Libya and Qaddafi's daughter was killed in one of those attacks.
[01:44:58.749 --> 01:45:08.135]  I think this plays into Qaddafi's hands, especially with the Saudi connection, because he now has some credentials to say,
[01:45:09.215 --> 01:45:11.276]  We know who the Saudis have backed.
[01:45:11.276 --> 01:45:12.636]  It's al-Qaeda.
[01:45:12.636 --> 01:45:17.258]  And now they're talking about putting Saudi personnel and weapons in here.
[01:45:17.258 --> 01:45:24.540]  And I think we're going to probably see him gain some support, because some people in Libya will say, look, we don't like Qaddafi.
[01:45:24.540 --> 01:45:26.141]  He's been around for 42 years.
[01:45:26.141 --> 01:45:27.161]  We're tired of him.
[01:45:27.161 --> 01:45:28.421]  He's a dictator.
[01:45:28.421 --> 01:45:30.982]  But darn it, he's our dictator.
[01:45:30.982 --> 01:45:34.843]  And when they see Western intervention, that plays into Libyan nationalism.
[01:45:34.843 --> 01:45:36.384]  And that is Qaddafi's strong card.
[01:45:37.031 --> 01:45:38.071]  Yeah.
[01:45:38.071 --> 01:45:45.794]  Okay, shifting gears, what are some of the big stories you've been working on, Wayne, that aren't dealing with the situation in the Middle East?
[01:45:45.794 --> 01:45:53.597]  Well, this whole thing I've been looking at for quite a few months about the history of Obama and his family.
[01:45:53.597 --> 01:45:57.518]  I really believe the birth certificate thing is a diversion.
[01:45:57.518 --> 01:46:00.359]  I think the White House loves people to talk about that.
[01:46:00.359 --> 01:46:01.640]  Even Karl Rove said that.
[01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:19.888]  I think the real issue is Obama's past with the Central Intelligence Agency, his mother, his stepfather in Indonesia, his grandmother and grandfather in Hawaii, and his alleged father, Barack Sr., out of Kenya.
[01:46:19.888 --> 01:46:28.312]  The more I look into this, it's quite clear that both Anne Dunham, Sotoro, Obama,
[01:46:28.972 --> 01:46:50.644]  Whatever, whatever her name was, was a flexible agent for the Central Intelligence Agency, and it's quite clear that Obama, with all these fields on his college transcripts and other parts of his record, that he was also
[01:46:51.364 --> 01:46:52.004]  We're good to go.
[01:47:16.857 --> 01:47:21.621]  Now what's the latest on the mafia situation going on there in Chicago?
[01:47:21.621 --> 01:47:32.669]  I saw a lot of even mainstream news articles about election fraud going on in the city famous for that and Rahm Emanuel being put in there to I guess keep all the bodies buried.
[01:47:33.632 --> 01:47:38.055]  Well, of course, he got the magic 55% in the election.
[01:47:38.055 --> 01:47:48.041]  And we know that historically in Chicago, they always can rely on the graveyard vote to get their favorite candidate into office.
[01:47:48.041 --> 01:47:58.807]  And it's quite clear that even with his transition team, he already had one lady resign because of an ethics scandal.
[01:47:58.807 --> 01:48:01.429]  I think this is the beginning of many, many major
[01:48:02.029 --> 01:48:02.749]  Ethics scandals.
[01:48:02.749 --> 01:48:09.832]  The problem in Chicago is the Chicago Tribune and the Sun-Times have gutted their investigative news staff.
[01:48:09.832 --> 01:48:29.800]  And so there's really, other than some enterprising internet journalists in Chicago, there's not much in the way of any media coverage of what we're going to see now with Emmanuel, just not only continuing the daily machine, but making it much worse as far as
[01:48:31.181 --> 01:48:36.528]  Uh, he's gonna try to bring casino gambling into Chicago.
[01:48:36.528 --> 01:48:39.692]  This is something that Rod Blagojevich was opposed to.
[01:48:39.692 --> 01:48:43.097]  We've got the second Blagojevich trial coming up in April.
[01:48:43.097 --> 01:48:46.381]  I noticed that Patrick Fitzgerald, the prosecutor, dropped
[01:48:46.883 --> 01:48:47.383]  I'm just
[01:49:18.184 --> 01:49:23.488]  Where do you see things going for Barack Obama into the 2012 election?
[01:49:23.488 --> 01:49:27.811]  Well, obviously there's a lot of people upset, especially in Wisconsin.
[01:49:27.811 --> 01:49:35.816]  They didn't see him providing any sort of bully pulpit against the governor there, what he's trying to do.
[01:49:35.816 --> 01:49:38.739]  Similarly in Ohio and New Jersey.
[01:49:38.739 --> 01:49:41.801]  Now remember, these are states that Obama won.
[01:49:41.801 --> 01:49:44.803]  If he loses union support, if he loses the
[01:49:45.163 --> 01:49:50.631]  Support of the blue collar, what we have left the blue collar people in this country anyway.
[01:49:50.631 --> 01:49:53.656]  I think we may see a challenger.
[01:49:53.656 --> 01:49:59.544]  Now Kucinich said he's not interested, but he also said that maybe there should be a challenger.
[01:50:02.190 --> 01:50:16.843]  Basically, Obama's going to probably ride into re-election because the Republicans won't put up anybody who people will like, especially those in the center, the Tea Party people might like them, but that's it.
[01:50:16.843 --> 01:50:19.125]  But I would not be surprised to see somebody
[01:50:19.885 --> 01:50:24.686]  I know Howard Dean said he's not interested, but whatever they say now isn't what they're going to do in the future.
[01:50:40.331 --> 01:50:43.735]  But I think one thing we can rule out is the Hillary Clinton challenge.
[01:50:43.735 --> 01:50:44.976]  I thought she might.
[01:50:44.976 --> 01:50:46.157]  There was noise.
[01:50:46.157 --> 01:50:53.125]  Bill Clinton was approaching people for financial support, but I think her career is pretty much over.
[01:50:53.125 --> 01:50:57.009]  Well, Wayne Madsen, WayneMadsenReport.com, OurSitesInfoWars.com.
[01:50:57.009 --> 01:50:58.390]  Wayne, thanks for joining us.
[01:50:58.390 --> 01:50:59.532]  Your phone call straight ahead.
[01:51:01.053 --> 01:51:02.354]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.354 --> 01:51:07.937]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.937 --> 01:51:12.959]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:12.959 --> 01:51:18.002]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:51:18.522 --> 01:51:23.743]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:23.743 --> 01:51:30.865]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:30.865 --> 01:51:31.985]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:31.985 --> 01:51:38.347]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:38.667 --> 01:51:41.848]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:41.848 --> 01:51:44.089]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[01:51:45.029 --> 01:51:45.269]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:45.269 --> 01:51:48.651]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.

[01:52:01.013 --> 01:52:03.596]  Never buy home canning jar lids again!
[01:52:03.596 --> 01:52:04.276]  No kidding!
[01:52:04.276 --> 01:52:08.661]  When you buy Tadler Reusable Canning Lids once, you'll never buy canning lids ever again.
[01:52:08.661 --> 01:52:11.423]  Safely store emergency preparedness foods for years.
[01:52:11.423 --> 01:52:14.887]  Traditional metal lids are single-use throwaways containing BPA.
[01:52:14.887 --> 01:52:19.911]  But Tadler Reusable Canning Lids are guaranteed to last a lifetime when used as design for home canning.
[01:52:19.911 --> 01:52:23.435]  Tadler Lids are made with a USDA and FDA approved food grade plastic.
[01:52:23.695 --> 01:52:26.818]  Safe for direct food contact and contain no BPA.
[01:52:26.818 --> 01:52:37.710]  Tadler Lids are dishwasher safe, usable with standard pressure or water bath canning, eliminate food spoilage from acid corrosion, fit standard mason jars, are indefinitely reusable and are proudly made in the USA.

[01:53:00.362 --> 01:53:02.564]  Have you ever consumed protein powder supplements?
[01:53:02.564 --> 01:53:07.868]  I have, and all of them don't taste that good, have artificial flavors, sweeteners, or unhealthy sugars.
[01:53:07.868 --> 01:53:12.192]  About a year ago, I was introduced to a new protein powder that changed my experience.
[01:53:12.192 --> 01:53:18.037]  This protein powder made me feel noticeably better, and it tasted more delicious than any drink I've ever had.
[01:53:18.037 --> 01:53:21.120]  Here's the experience of one satisfied user named Rich.
[01:53:21.120 --> 01:53:28.706]  The term best of all worlds has been belabored to death, and yet I've just discovered a whey protein powder that truly deserves to be called best of
[01:53:30.736 --> 01:53:31.877]  We're good to go.
[01:54:01.407 --> 01:54:21.297]  You know, I'm under the weather today, so I'm a little bit slow, but we've got near-record internet stream listeners.
[01:54:21.297 --> 01:54:25.839]  Just illustrating that the listeners are putting up with me, and I appreciate that.
[01:54:25.839 --> 01:54:30.342]  But we are covering some of the most important issues out there in the world.
[01:54:31.581 --> 01:54:48.388]  And that's my only desire is to be able to really get these points across in ways that are easily understood to not just our regular listeners, but to all the new listeners that we have tuning in on a routine basis.
[01:54:48.388 --> 01:54:52.410]  The world is going crazy.
[01:54:52.410 --> 01:54:58.733]  There is a powerful group of globalists who want to destroy our infrastructure,
[01:55:00.410 --> 01:55:04.754]  And reduce us to absolute serfdom.
[01:55:04.754 --> 01:55:14.802]  Now I'm gonna go to Patrick and Steve and Dana and Bill and Mary, ahead of Max Keiser joining us coming up a little bit into the next hour.
[01:55:14.802 --> 01:55:17.043]  I've also got a bunch of Twitter questions here.
[01:55:17.043 --> 01:55:25.130]  A lot of great questions here from Twitter.
[01:55:25.130 --> 01:55:28.613]  Like, why is the EPA considering regulating dust
[01:55:30.069 --> 01:55:33.211]  Yet quite all right with toxins in the air, water, and food.
[01:55:33.211 --> 01:55:38.635]  I'm going to answer that after Max Keiser leaves us.
[01:55:38.635 --> 01:55:39.236]  Here's another one.
[01:55:39.236 --> 01:55:43.258]  Please talk about the US-Canada secret merger signed February 4, 2011.
[01:55:43.258 --> 01:55:46.441]  Well, that's not secret.
[01:55:46.441 --> 01:55:52.365]  That was the consummation of the SPP agreement for the continental security zone.
[01:55:53.953 --> 01:56:00.820]  But actually guys, print me an article about Obama signs continental security zone, so when I answer that question I'll have the proof.
[01:56:00.820 --> 01:56:01.080]  Thanks.
[01:56:02.412 --> 01:56:06.213]  A bunch of really good questions here that I'll get to after Max leaves us.
[01:56:06.213 --> 01:56:08.013]  He's just on with us for 20 minutes.
[01:56:08.013 --> 01:56:11.554]  Then we'll finish up with calls and Twitter questions.
[01:56:11.554 --> 01:56:14.175]  Twitter.com forward slash RealAlexJones.
[01:56:14.175 --> 01:56:19.476]  If you want to follow us there, we're going to start adding more information to that daily.
[01:56:19.476 --> 01:56:23.497]  Photos, inside info on who's coming up on the show, your questions.
[01:56:23.497 --> 01:56:26.138]  Twitter.com forward slash RealAlexJones.
[01:56:26.138 --> 01:56:29.339]  And don't forget, this radio broadcast is also listener
[01:56:31.550 --> 01:56:42.841]  Listeners supported and we have the online video bookstore at InfoWars.com where you can get the new book, The Only Place You Can Get It, Big Brother, The Orwellian Nightmare Come True by Mark Dice.
[01:56:42.841 --> 01:56:51.048]  Films like What in the World Are They Spring, Documenting the Chemtrails, Invisible Empire, New Order Defined, covering the whole globalist infrastructure.
[01:56:52.049 --> 01:56:59.091]  All these books and videos are absolutely key to not just informing yourself to a higher level, but informing those around you.
[01:56:59.091 --> 01:57:02.632]  So, InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:57:02.632 --> 01:57:08.454]  And everything we do here, again, is possible because of your support.
[01:57:08.454 --> 01:57:13.015]  We have the great You Are The Resistance, Fee For Victory t-shirts that are very popular.
[01:57:13.015 --> 01:57:19.997]  We have the Draft Ron Paul 2012 shirts that as soon as he announces, we're gonna stop selling them, so those are limited edition.
[01:57:20.977 --> 01:57:40.690]  Hi Alex, I was wondering if you heard this new song by Lupe Fiasco, it's called Words I Never Said, and it talks about 9-11, Building 7, all this crazy stuff you wouldn't think would be in a song.
[01:57:40.690 --> 01:57:48.456]  Also, there's this new game coming out, it's called Homefront, and it's got mass graves,
[01:57:49.557 --> 01:57:50.677]  Like, it's crazy.
[01:57:50.677 --> 01:57:56.279]  People are being bulldozed into mass graves in these concentration camps.
[01:57:56.279 --> 01:58:03.062]  You know, one of my crew was talking about Homefront video game and similar things this morning.
[01:58:03.062 --> 01:58:10.544]  So it's, I mean, most of these new video games are about UN invading America, mass graves, mass death.
[01:58:10.544 --> 01:58:15.746]  But then in reality, the police are secretly being trained for this.
[01:58:15.746 --> 01:58:17.967]  So it deals with mass graves here in America?
[01:58:19.338 --> 01:58:26.081]  Uh, no, I don't know where it was, but it looked like there were American troops and it was not a safe town without banners on the walls and stuff.
[01:58:26.081 --> 01:58:29.542]  Yeah, for some reason your phone, I'm having trouble understanding much of what you're saying.
[01:58:29.542 --> 01:58:32.423]  Call us back when you've got a better phone, Patrick.
[01:58:32.423 --> 01:58:39.726]  Phone quality overall in America is going down because everybody's on IP phones, but I couldn't understand a word or two of that.
[01:58:39.726 --> 01:58:43.867]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:43.867 --> 01:58:46.768]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.799 --> 01:58:55.002]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:58:55.002 --> 01:59:01.406]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:59:01.406 --> 01:59:08.811]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:59:08.811 --> 01:59:13.675]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[01:59:22.339 --> 01:59:26.580]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[01:59:26.580 --> 01:59:33.342]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:59:33.342 --> 01:59:36.683]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:59:39.524 --> 01:59:39.764]  3-4-0-7-0-9-1.
[01:59:39.764 --> 01:59:49.569]  Visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying a 1-2 month soap sampler.
[01:59:49.569 --> 01:59:53.731]  Thank you.

[01:59:56.112 --> 01:59:58.954]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.526 --> 02:00:10.347]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.347 --> 02:00:11.927]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.927 --> 02:00:13.488]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.488 --> 02:00:17.669]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.669 --> 02:00:21.989]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:21.989 --> 02:00:28.911]  All right, Kaiser's popping in for two segments to his final report from the Middle East for us.
[02:00:30.458 --> 02:00:31.258]  We are live.
[02:00:31.258 --> 02:00:33.060]  It is Monday, the 7th day of March, 2011.
[02:00:33.060 --> 02:00:40.644]  We're going to go to Steve, Dana, Bill, Mary, Bobby, and others.
[02:00:43.254 --> 02:00:49.738]  I've got a bunch of really informative, very good questions that came in on Twitter.
[02:00:49.738 --> 02:00:53.120]  We're going to answer some more of the questions as well coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[02:00:53.120 --> 02:00:55.261]  Twitter.com forward slash RealAlexJones.
[02:00:55.261 --> 02:00:59.063]  If you want to follow us there, there's the site.
[02:00:59.063 --> 02:01:03.686]  Let's go ahead and jam in a call or two before Kaiser comes on with us.
[02:01:03.686 --> 02:01:05.066]  Let's talk to Steven Illinois.
[02:01:05.066 --> 02:01:05.727]  Steven, you're on the air.
[02:01:06.940 --> 02:01:08.080]  Hello, Alex.
[02:01:08.080 --> 02:01:10.261]  I'm a first-time caller and big supporter.
[02:01:10.261 --> 02:01:20.285]  I'm also a musician under the name SDM, who have written and recorded songs influenced by the topics you discuss that reach thousands on the internet.
[02:01:20.285 --> 02:01:20.885]  Well done!
[02:01:20.885 --> 02:01:22.666]  I wanted to ask you... What's that?
[02:01:22.666 --> 02:01:25.247]  I said, well done!
[02:01:25.247 --> 02:01:33.170]  But I wanted to ask you if you saw the band Muse performing the song The Resistance on the Grammys.
[02:01:34.088 --> 02:01:39.884]  I did see a clip of it online where they had like SWAT teams and riot police coming after him, right?
[02:01:40.717 --> 02:01:42.218]  Yeah, it was awesome.
[02:01:42.218 --> 02:01:44.019]  I couldn't believe they let him do it.
[02:01:44.019 --> 02:01:54.767]  Well, I'll tell you, Muse, Bellamy, the only links they've got on their official website to news are Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and Propagandamatrix.com.
[02:01:54.767 --> 02:01:59.050]  That's Watson's mirror of Prison Planet.
[02:01:59.050 --> 02:02:00.251]  And I got Bellamy on.
[02:02:00.251 --> 02:02:01.151]  He's a big fan.
[02:02:01.151 --> 02:02:09.958]  And then I was so stupid, I only had the Austin number, which was just the cell phone of his Austin helper, and I could not get through their management.
[02:02:11.038 --> 02:02:13.459]  Which is fine, I don't even care, whatever.
[02:02:13.459 --> 02:02:18.940]  But I know that Muse are fans of the show and that is certainly exciting.
[02:02:18.940 --> 02:02:21.961]  I did talk to Dave Mustaine this weekend.
[02:02:21.961 --> 02:02:24.041]  He's going to be coming back on the show.
[02:02:24.041 --> 02:02:24.941]  Dave gave me a call.
[02:02:24.941 --> 02:02:27.322]  I want to say hi to Dave and his wife that are listening.
[02:02:27.322 --> 02:02:29.022]  So he's going to be back on the show.
[02:02:29.022 --> 02:02:32.943]  But there's so many prominent media people that do know what's going on.
[02:02:34.133 --> 02:02:35.214]  Yeah, Dave's awesome.
[02:02:35.214 --> 02:02:42.841]  But I just want to thank you for everything you do and have done, and I will continue my fight in the info war.
[02:02:42.841 --> 02:02:43.521]  God bless you.
[02:02:43.521 --> 02:02:44.742]  Well, I appreciate that, Steve.
[02:02:44.742 --> 02:02:45.803]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:02:45.803 --> 02:02:55.331]  You know, when you've been sick a few days and you're almost well, you think you're ready to go back to work, but I have been a little bit punch-drunk today.
[02:02:55.331 --> 02:02:57.994]  Do you think I should have sat it out today, or has the show been okay?
[02:02:59.392 --> 02:03:00.253]  Oh, the show's been great.
[02:03:00.253 --> 02:03:00.993]  Hey Alex, I appreciate it.
[02:03:00.993 --> 02:03:01.654]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:03:01.654 --> 02:03:02.994]  Wishing you a speedy and full recovery.
[02:03:23.366 --> 02:03:27.669]  My question is in regard to the Federal Reserve.
[02:03:27.669 --> 02:03:32.252]  I recently saw a movie, a video, by Clint Richardson.
[02:03:32.252 --> 02:03:34.334]  We Are Change member in Utah.
[02:03:34.334 --> 02:03:36.656]  Movie was Corporation Nation.
[02:03:36.656 --> 02:03:44.521]  And he expounds on Walter Berrien's work and your work on the Comprehensive Financial Annual Report.
[02:03:44.521 --> 02:03:49.165]  And he raises a question at the end of that video that I wanted to put out to you.
[02:03:49.165 --> 02:03:50.966]  As a private corporation,
[02:03:51.564 --> 02:03:57.507]  The Federal Reserve is required to issue a Comprehensive Financial Report.
[02:03:57.507 --> 02:04:04.071]  Wouldn't a review of that report serve the same purpose as an audit of the Fed?
[02:04:05.680 --> 02:04:09.844]  Yes, it would have a similar effect.
[02:04:09.844 --> 02:04:24.078]  But again, it took us decades to just get the public to realize we have a private Federal Reserve running the country, much less get them to realize that there's double sets of books for the school district, water districts, counties, cities, states, every federal agency.
[02:04:24.078 --> 02:04:30.323]  And again, in the last 50 years, 50 plus years, most of those
[02:04:31.124 --> 02:04:39.587]  Investments that were off budget were put basically into the foreign banks and have now been stolen through derivatives.
[02:04:39.587 --> 02:04:40.848]  So a lot of that is gone.
[02:04:40.848 --> 02:04:45.210]  Because it isn't enough for the globalists don't want to make you rich.
[02:04:45.210 --> 02:04:50.392]  They want to create bubbles so they can consolidate power.
[02:04:50.392 --> 02:04:51.532]  Then pop the bubbles.
[02:04:51.532 --> 02:04:57.194]  Then they're the only ones with money that can come back in and buy up everything else for pennies on the dollar.
[02:04:57.194 --> 02:04:57.794]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:57.794 --> 02:04:58.975]  Good question.
[02:05:01.803 --> 02:05:17.278]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[02:05:17.278 --> 02:05:20.962]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:21.983 --> 02:05:34.735]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:05:34.735 --> 02:05:42.001]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[02:05:42.682 --> 02:05:53.074]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[02:05:53.074 --> 02:05:56.999]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[02:05:56.999 --> 02:06:00.102]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[02:06:00.703 --> 02:06:05.244]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:06:05.244 --> 02:06:06.165]  Number one.
[02:06:06.165 --> 02:06:09.586]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:06:09.586 --> 02:06:10.446]  Number two.
[02:06:10.446 --> 02:06:15.328]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:06:15.328 --> 02:06:16.088]  It's true.
[02:06:16.088 --> 02:06:20.949]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:06:20.949 --> 02:06:21.770]  Number three.
[02:06:21.770 --> 02:06:25.351]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:06:25.351 --> 02:06:29.052]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:06:29.272 --> 02:06:30.073]  Number 4.
[02:06:30.073 --> 02:06:32.816]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:06:32.816 --> 02:06:36.520]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:06:36.520 --> 02:06:37.301]  Number 5.
[02:06:37.301 --> 02:06:41.446]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:06:41.446 --> 02:06:46.211]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:07:13.670 --> 02:07:15.411]  I'm looking for a factory

[02:08:02.409 --> 02:08:09.039]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:09.039 --> 02:08:12.024]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:26.883 --> 02:08:46.984]  Okay, so this weekend, I was sent a clip of Max Keiser in Cairo, and with a very satisfied, satiated look in his eye, as if he was giving me the holy grail, he walks over to some guy in the square and says, tell Alex Jones your message.
[02:08:47.878 --> 02:08:53.986]  And the guy says, Alex, it was not just people from Facebook here in the square.
[02:08:53.986 --> 02:08:57.049]  The revolution was real.
[02:08:57.049 --> 02:09:02.296]  And then Kaiser, with a very satisfied look, says, see, Alex?
[02:09:03.617 --> 02:09:06.940]  We could probably even play that ridiculous clip.
[02:09:06.940 --> 02:09:12.703]  I guess implying that I'm saying none of this rebellion is real.
[02:09:12.703 --> 02:09:12.983]  No.
[02:09:12.983 --> 02:09:18.067]  I know that it's caused because of dollar devaluation worldwide.
[02:09:18.067 --> 02:09:24.031]  And so it costs more for these people making on average $2 a day or less to buy their food.
[02:09:25.011 --> 02:09:29.517]  But I also know that they sent Alberti in two weeks before this implosion began.
[02:09:29.517 --> 02:09:35.104]  I said three weeks ago that there would be SAS commandos inside Libya.
[02:09:35.104 --> 02:09:37.167]  Watson wrote about it 12 days ago.
[02:09:37.167 --> 02:09:41.212]  Now it's confirmed, what, five months ago?
[02:09:42.850 --> 02:09:52.979]  Lindsey Williams on this radio show said his big oil company exec source told him that they would destabilize the Middle East, order out of chaos.
[02:09:52.979 --> 02:10:00.026]  So I'm not saying that there aren't people rebelling in Ireland and Greece and here in the US against austerity.
[02:10:00.626 --> 02:10:00.726]  I'm
[02:10:18.823 --> 02:10:23.889]  Saudi Arabia is having demonstrations all over it.
[02:10:23.889 --> 02:10:28.455]  So there's a lot of things happening here, but the question is, why is it starting now?
[02:10:28.455 --> 02:10:37.765]  Now, he just got back from his week-long visit in the Middle East, and to give us any final reports on that from Paris is Max Keiser.
[02:10:37.765 --> 02:10:38.667]  Max, good to have you with us.
[02:10:39.619 --> 02:10:40.760]  Hey Alex Jones.
[02:10:40.760 --> 02:10:42.322]  Yeah, we were gone for two weeks.
[02:10:42.322 --> 02:10:44.664]  We were in Beirut and then Cairo.
[02:10:44.664 --> 02:10:48.688]  And yeah, we did that report from Tahir Square, which was the, uh, made famous.
[02:10:49.601 --> 02:10:54.182]  From all the reports from the revolution in Cairo.
[02:10:54.182 --> 02:10:57.183]  I was talking to some people actually about Alex Jones.
[02:10:57.183 --> 02:11:04.404]  Your name is known amongst the revolutionaries in Egypt and in Cairo, which I was surprised to hear.
[02:11:04.404 --> 02:11:10.345]  Because after we did that clip, talking to that guy in the square, people were like, Alex Jones!
[02:11:10.345 --> 02:11:11.266]  Alex Jones!
[02:11:11.266 --> 02:11:12.546]  They thought you were there.
[02:11:12.546 --> 02:11:13.326]  They were looking for you.
[02:11:20.875 --> 02:11:23.437]  Well, they just don't know how good you are, Max.
[02:11:23.437 --> 02:11:29.221]  Max, I'm not saying that Hazem Mubarak wasn't evil and there wasn't a hunger to overthrow him.
[02:11:29.221 --> 02:11:35.625]  All I'm saying is now they've put in one of his generals, one of his adjuncts is in control there.
[02:11:37.246 --> 02:11:54.994]  Well, yeah, his number two took over, then he resigned, and now this new guy, they actually put a new guy in yesterday, as Wayne Matson was talking about right before, a few minutes ago, I was listening to Wade Manson's interview, and he made some really good points.
[02:11:54.994 --> 02:12:00.256]  He talked about the fact that they have put in now a new prime minister that the people are happy with.
[02:12:00.256 --> 02:12:03.097]  If this guy doesn't perform, then they're going to demand another prime minister.
[02:12:03.257 --> 02:12:05.560]  No, no, that's what you said last week, so you're right.
[02:12:05.560 --> 02:12:07.122]  In fact, here's Reuters.
[02:12:07.122 --> 02:12:11.208]  Knives, petrol bombs returned to Cairo streets.
[02:12:11.208 --> 02:12:18.837]  And it says that men with plain clothes, armed with swords and petrol bombs attacked protesters in Cairo on Sunday night.
[02:12:19.358 --> 02:12:25.783]  During a demonstration demanding reform of security services with a reputation for brutality, witnesses said.
[02:12:25.783 --> 02:12:41.537]  So this clearly shows the security services are in plain clothes attacking the peaceful demonstrators, which does show that somebody in the government, I mean these corrupt mafia security services, want to try to get the public back in line.
[02:12:42.429 --> 02:12:57.082]  Right, the security services, the secret police, what happened on Sunday and on Saturday is that the protesters who stormed a lot of these government buildings, they stormed into the Secret Service area buildings where they do all the torture.
[02:12:57.082 --> 02:13:02.286]  You know America outsources its torture to Egypt, and one of those locations is in Cairo.
[02:13:02.286 --> 02:13:09.993]  And so the public stormed in there, they started ripping the place apart, and they found a lot of the Secret Service guys are trying desperately to shred documents.
[02:13:10.433 --> 02:13:10.873]  Wow.
[02:13:10.873 --> 02:13:12.034]  Tell us more about that.
[02:13:12.034 --> 02:13:20.117]  So certainly then, the globalists saw a revolution coming, they tried to control it, but they're not able to control it.
[02:13:37.528 --> 02:13:49.523]  Well, I mean, look at how the rebels, backing up what you're saying, I'm just trying to throw out both perspectives here, look at how the rebels, even against Gaddafi, didn't want the SAS's help and have grabbed the British troops.
[02:13:50.928 --> 02:14:06.913]  Yeah, in Cairo, which I think is a very interesting situation of all of the countries in revolt right now, because it's a very well-educated population, and they are really got their head screwed on straight in terms of wanting to
[02:14:07.513 --> 02:14:07.954]  I think so.
[02:14:26.867 --> 02:14:39.421]  And they're out there trying to cause mayhem, but the size of the protest and the knowledge base of the protesters who are using social media to exchange... When I was in Cairo just last night, Alex, I'm in Paris now.
[02:14:39.421 --> 02:14:40.922]  I just arrived here three hours ago.
[02:14:40.922 --> 02:14:45.027]  From my hotel room in Cairo, I was following the Twitter streams of
[02:14:46.608 --> 02:14:56.415]  Protestors swapping information about where the secret police were, what they're doing, who do we send over there to swarm them, you know, flash mob, surround them.
[02:14:56.415 --> 02:14:59.256]  And they're just using the tool of Twitter in real time.
[02:14:59.256 --> 02:15:00.577]  I was watching it tonight.
[02:15:00.577 --> 02:15:02.138]  One of the buildings they set is on fire.
[02:15:02.138 --> 02:15:04.120]  I could see the smoke from my hotel room.
[02:15:04.120 --> 02:15:13.486]  And I could watch the interaction between social media, Twitter, the activists, and their desire to overthrow the corrupt government and all the secret police really in real time.
[02:15:13.826 --> 02:15:25.269]  Well, what you just said, for those that don't know, is confirmed here by Reuters that the demonstrators have been breaking into the Interior Ministry's facilities that serve as a domestic spy agency.
[02:15:25.269 --> 02:15:30.471]  So basically, the public's breaking into the threat fusion centers, the spying torture centers.
[02:15:31.243 --> 02:15:31.823]  Yep, yep.
[02:15:31.823 --> 02:15:38.827]  And of course, we know that under the Bush administration that they outsourced through the, what they call, extraordinary rendition.
[02:15:38.827 --> 02:15:39.687]  They sent prisoners.
[02:15:39.687 --> 02:15:47.351]  I did a film for this, for Al Jazeera, about a guy named Abu Omar, who they kidnapped in Milan, Italy, and sent to a torture center in Egypt.
[02:15:47.831 --> 02:16:07.106]  And they got busted by the Italian police because the Italian police, because of the drug laws and anti-drug laws, are so harsh and fierce that they foolishly went in violation of the Italian police and it triggers an immediate investigation that goes around the government because they carved this out to fight the Costa Nostra there.
[02:16:07.626 --> 02:16:21.708]  And this set up a situation where the CIA was revealed to have spent $500,000 to $600,000 on laundry hotels in Milan and Venice, pursuing this guy Abu Omar to put him on a flight to Egypt for torture.
[02:16:21.708 --> 02:16:27.229]  It was an Italian national that they suspected of bad things.
[02:16:27.229 --> 02:16:29.430]  And so anyway, these extraordinary rendition flights.
[02:16:29.430 --> 02:16:36.151]  There's an excellent book on this called Ghost Plane from a guy who I interviewed in this film, talking about all the unmarked planes that are out.
[02:16:36.511 --> 02:16:41.972]  Well, one of the CIA ghost planes crashed a few years ago with three and a half tons of pure cocaine in Mexico.
[02:16:41.972 --> 02:16:44.813]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[02:16:44.813 --> 02:16:48.114]  They broke into this torture center.
[02:16:48.114 --> 02:16:49.514]  There's a few of them in the country.
[02:16:49.514 --> 02:16:50.975]  They're gathering information.
[02:16:50.975 --> 02:16:52.155]  They're getting all this information.
[02:16:52.155 --> 02:16:53.995]  They're going to make public this information.
[02:16:53.995 --> 02:17:04.358]  But yeah, the few guys that are still left, they're being pursued by the new activists to be prosecuted and brought to justice when they have a justice system in place.
[02:17:04.358 --> 02:17:05.198]  So they're panicking.
[02:17:05.758 --> 02:17:12.087]  And I don't give them a good odd of being successful.
[02:17:12.087 --> 02:17:18.115]  These protesters in Egypt and in Cairo, in my opinion, is really the nerve center for the entire world.
[02:17:18.115 --> 02:17:21.440]  Even Wayne Matson said in your previous interview, he talked about this global
[02:17:22.060 --> 02:17:23.862]  It's a global revolution.
[02:17:23.862 --> 02:17:28.526]  You know, we've been talking about it on your show, the global insurrection against banker occupation.
[02:17:28.526 --> 02:17:37.693]  It is a global event, and I think in Wisconsin, they're revolting against their corrupt dictator, Scott Walker.
[02:17:37.693 --> 02:17:45.300]  And I really am surprised that the people who are protesting against Scott Walker and fighting the protesters
[02:17:45.660 --> 02:17:52.965]  Don't understand that everyone who's involved here, you're either part of the kleptocracy of Scott Walker or you're a peasant.
[02:17:52.965 --> 02:17:55.767]  It's not about right, left, neoliberal, conservative.
[02:17:55.767 --> 02:17:57.128]  They're all peasants.
[02:17:57.128 --> 02:18:00.390]  Everyone living in Wisconsin is a peasant if you're not Scott Walker.
[02:18:00.390 --> 02:18:04.273]  Everyone living in Ohio, in Illinois, in New York, in California, if you're not
[02:18:04.833 --> 02:18:07.234]  On the Goldman Sachs partner list, you're a peasant.
[02:18:07.234 --> 02:18:12.377]  And this is a peasant revolt in Wisconsin, just like it's a peasant revolt in Cairo.
[02:18:12.377 --> 02:18:16.519]  But it's a peasant revolt armed with technology and social media.
[02:18:16.519 --> 02:18:24.743]  You know, had the revolutionaries in France, where I am now, in Paris 200 and something years ago, revolted back then and they had these tools available.
[02:18:24.743 --> 02:18:29.605]  They would be using these tools for the same reason, to fight the same corrupt bankers, for the same reason.
[02:18:29.605 --> 02:18:30.806]  So history repeats itself.
[02:18:31.466 --> 02:18:52.626]  Well, to be clear, though, Max, I agree with you that, I mean, it's a fact that if you've got $1,500 trillion in derivatives, that Scott Walker and, you know, the governor in New Jersey, not just Wisconsin, saying, let's cut, you know, unions bargaining, that's going to fix the economy.
[02:18:52.626 --> 02:18:55.109]  I mean, that is literally a joke.
[02:18:55.848 --> 02:19:03.673]  Because what about the people, you know, the idea about all these union folks, government union folks are getting a sweet deal.
[02:19:03.673 --> 02:19:10.497]  Well, look at it the other way around and ask yourself, why are the people who are not getting that sweet deal getting a sweet deal?
[02:19:10.497 --> 02:19:16.461]  In other words, why should the people who are not getting a good deal be fighting the people who are workers?
[02:19:17.458 --> 02:19:18.499]  And getting a good deal.
[02:19:18.499 --> 02:19:25.046]  Shouldn't they all be fighting for a good deal against the people who stole their money, including Scott Walker and the corrupt bankers?
[02:19:25.046 --> 02:19:33.155]  But what I was gonna say, Max, and we'll come back and talk more about this, is that yes, it's a scapegoat to go after the unions.
[02:19:33.155 --> 02:19:36.839]  But when you have statements by Michael Moore about
[02:19:37.680 --> 02:19:42.903]  Anybody's money in America is a natural resource and belongs to everybody else.
[02:19:42.903 --> 02:19:49.588]  It's the image of the government coming and taking middle class people's money to then give it to the unions.
[02:19:49.588 --> 02:19:50.768]  That's the issue.
[02:19:50.768 --> 02:19:58.273]  So it's the big banksters playing the unions off against the middle class when we should be together against the banksters.
[02:19:58.273 --> 02:20:00.715]  Then we can fight it out later amongst ourselves.
[02:20:01.826 --> 02:20:05.009]  Forget everything you've been told about long-term food storage.

[02:24:03.570 --> 02:24:20.863]  The preacher man says it's the end of time And the Mississippi River, she's a gold drive The interest is up and the stock market's down And you're only getting mugged if you go downtown
[02:24:23.061 --> 02:24:37.830]  Okay, let's play this short clip of Michael Moore, because here's the other side of the issue, when you have government unions always pushing for more, more, more, more, more, and having cops out there revenue generating for their own pensions.
[02:24:37.830 --> 02:24:45.395]  That's the other side, and that's why somebody like Governor Walker looks legitimate to conservatives, because he's saying, oh look, middle class,
[02:24:46.587 --> 02:24:49.029]  The unions are robbing you.
[02:24:49.029 --> 02:25:01.778]  My point is the big mega banks have set up this architecture and you could get rid of all the unions, all the pension funds, it still wouldn't pay a fraction of the derivatives that this country signed on to.
[02:25:01.778 --> 02:25:02.919]  That's my point.
[02:25:02.919 --> 02:25:05.421]  Here's Michael Moore.
[02:25:05.421 --> 02:25:07.223]  This country is not broke.
[02:25:07.223 --> 02:25:08.664]  State of Wisconsin is not broke.
[02:25:09.537 --> 02:25:12.258]  There's a ton of cash in this country.
[02:25:12.258 --> 02:25:14.119]  Trillions of dollars of it.
[02:25:14.119 --> 02:25:15.480]  But it's a finite amount.
[02:25:15.480 --> 02:25:18.101]  There is only so much cash.
[02:25:18.101 --> 02:25:18.882]  Alright?
[02:25:18.882 --> 02:25:26.165]  What's happened is, is that we've allowed a vast majority of that cash to be concentrated in the hands of just a few people.
[02:25:26.165 --> 02:25:27.986]  And they're not circulating that cash.
[02:25:27.986 --> 02:25:30.688]  If you don't believe that, go try and get a loan right now.
[02:25:30.688 --> 02:25:32.148]  They're sitting on the money.
[02:25:32.148 --> 02:25:35.430]  They're using it for their own... They're putting it someplace else.
[02:25:35.430 --> 02:25:37.291]  They have no interest in helping you.
[02:25:38.575 --> 02:25:38.755]  All right.
[02:25:50.225 --> 02:25:52.647]  So it's a natural resource.
[02:25:52.647 --> 02:25:55.569]  Now, what he said was partially true.
[02:25:55.569 --> 02:26:00.472]  The bankers have gotten the $28 trillion-plus, hoarded it for themselves.
[02:26:00.472 --> 02:26:03.775]  If they do give you loans, some credit card loans, APR, are now $79.9.
[02:26:03.775 --> 02:26:05.456]  Last time I checked it was $69, now it's $79.
[02:26:10.339 --> 02:26:11.440]  In fact, they won't believe that.
[02:26:11.440 --> 02:26:14.563]  Put up the CNN for me, show them that.
[02:26:14.563 --> 02:26:22.691]  So yeah, that's true, but the person that gets taxed is an Alex Jones.
[02:26:22.691 --> 02:26:26.354]  And then you do have these arrogant government workers who think they're God.
[02:26:26.354 --> 02:26:27.956]  That's the point I'm making, Max Keiser.
[02:26:29.352 --> 02:26:30.893]  Well, you bring up a few points.
[02:26:30.893 --> 02:26:38.696]  First of all, I'm not in Michael Moore's camp, never have been, because he's not financially literate.
[02:26:38.696 --> 02:26:47.180]  Ron Paul is financially literate, and he makes great statements about why we should get rid of the CIA and these other things, because it's a complete waste of money.
[02:26:47.180 --> 02:26:53.282]  But Michael Moore, when he talks about capitalism or finance and markets, he's obviously illiterate on these subjects.
[02:26:53.282 --> 02:26:57.024]  His film Capitalism, a love story, tries to be critical of capitalism, but never
[02:26:57.717 --> 02:26:58.158]  We're good to go.
[02:27:06.863 --> 02:27:21.850]  Playing into his very limited understanding of these issues, and then building a polemic around this limited understanding, and he has great support among a lot of people, but his underlying points don't make any economic sense.
[02:27:21.850 --> 02:27:32.575]  Now in the case of Wisconsin, the way I would differentiate my views, in terms of why I think there's a regime change necessary, Scott Walker should go, and that the union workers should not be vilified.
[02:27:33.115 --> 02:27:33.275]  I think.
[02:27:47.987 --> 02:27:52.529]  Keeping that in mind, it's not about redistributing wealth, it's about redistributing risk.
[02:28:10.011 --> 02:28:10.271]  I think so.
[02:28:26.741 --> 02:28:35.272]  Yeah, they've got a rigged game like it's a casino, as you always say, where the house always wins.
[02:28:35.272 --> 02:28:37.234]  I mean, it's a rigged game.
[02:28:37.234 --> 02:28:39.217]  This is not capitalism.
[02:28:39.217 --> 02:28:42.301]  This is a fascist fraud that we're living in.
[02:28:42.301 --> 02:28:44.523]  The casino analogy is a good one.
[02:28:46.269 --> 02:28:52.692]  The House always wins, and that's the casino gulag mentality, and it's completely wrong.
[02:28:52.692 --> 02:29:01.257]  What you need in a good working capitalist free market society is you need to have equal risk and equal reward.
[02:29:01.257 --> 02:29:02.678]  If someone's willing to take a risk,
[02:29:03.238 --> 02:29:06.120]  And if they lose, they're penalized.
[02:29:06.120 --> 02:29:11.384]  And then that creates a certain creative destruction, as it's called in economic circles.
[02:29:11.384 --> 02:29:16.628]  And people are challenging themselves to take risks and be entrepreneurial and create jobs.
[02:29:16.628 --> 02:29:25.255]  But right now, the risk is borne by the 99% of the population that can't afford to take the risk.
[02:29:25.655 --> 02:29:33.158]  And all the rewards are sucked up by that top 1% who's got the political clout to channel all the reward into their pockets.
[02:29:33.158 --> 02:29:37.700]  And every time they make a bad bet, they get the government to impose austerity measures on the population.
[02:29:37.700 --> 02:29:41.781]  That's the issue that I think is at the heart of all of the underlying economic issues.
[02:29:41.781 --> 02:29:43.542]  Tell you what, finish up on the other side.
[02:29:43.542 --> 02:29:45.643]  This is important.
[02:29:45.643 --> 02:29:51.325]  Finish up on this definition issue.
[02:29:51.325 --> 02:29:52.725]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.725 --> 02:29:54.226]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.234 --> 02:29:57.922]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.293 --> 02:30:09.319]  Alex has told you that the Mideast uprisings over food prices and shortages caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide.
[02:30:09.319 --> 02:30:12.001]  We're seeing the impact right here in the United States.
[02:30:12.001 --> 02:30:21.049]  Ethanol, that was supposed to reduce petroleum use and fuel prices, hit a 30-month high in February, and pump prices are expected to reach $5 a gallon.
[02:30:21.049 --> 02:30:29.296]  Because of shipping costs, food is being priced out of the reach of millions of Americans, with an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days.
[02:30:29.296 --> 02:30:30.077]  Move quickly while

[02:31:02.365 --> 02:31:04.906]  And you're subject to other police action.
[02:31:04.906 --> 02:31:06.167]  Tyranny is here.
[02:31:06.167 --> 02:31:09.749]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:31:09.749 --> 02:31:12.330]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:31:12.330 --> 02:31:18.213]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:31:18.213 --> 02:31:24.436]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:31:24.856 --> 02:31:30.817]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:31:30.817 --> 02:31:35.018]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[02:31:35.018 --> 02:31:39.299]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:31:39.299 --> 02:31:45.260]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:31:45.260 --> 02:31:48.800]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:31:48.800 --> 02:31:50.781]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:31:50.781 --> 02:31:51.221]  It's here.

[02:32:58.982 --> 02:33:02.945]  Thank you!
[02:33:02.945 --> 02:33:06.388]  I remember when I remember I remember when I lost my mind
[02:33:12.559 --> 02:33:19.482]  Okay, I got a bunch of really important questions you guys sent in via Twitter.
[02:33:19.482 --> 02:33:22.604]  Twitter.com forward slash RealAlexJones.
[02:33:22.604 --> 02:33:29.407]  We're talking to Max Kaiser of MaxKaiser.com and I'm also going to get to some of the folks that are holding
[02:33:31.274 --> 02:33:33.995]  Your phone calls are coming up here in a few minutes as well.
[02:33:33.995 --> 02:33:49.042]  But Max, finishing up, because I agree with the economic analysis you're giving of what a true free market system is versus what we have now, which is a rigged financial terrorist
[02:33:49.702 --> 02:34:09.162]  Predatory consolidation system, then the big bankers openly fund communism and socialism as a way to then give a false alternative to the public, who then run away from the bankers and call for socialism, which then only communalizes the wealth, which only allows the bankers to steal it even that much more easily.
[02:34:10.031 --> 02:34:17.133]  Well, it's socialism buying for the bankers, because they get the government to pay them a huge annual bonus of salary.
[02:34:17.133 --> 02:34:18.633]  They are living in a socialist world.
[02:34:18.633 --> 02:34:23.414]  Everyone else is forced to live in a capitalist world, what's left.
[02:34:23.414 --> 02:34:26.074]  But they just finalized that point.
[02:34:26.074 --> 02:34:31.596]  And by the way, Alex, you know, you've got to play my clip from Russia Today, my two-minute clip.
[02:34:31.596 --> 02:34:36.497]  I don't know why you're delaying on this, but this is a fantastic clip that I sent back.
[02:34:36.497 --> 02:34:37.417]  You should play that clip.
[02:34:38.123 --> 02:34:50.873]  But, anyway, getting to my point, with this Wisconsin debate, the people who are attacking these public sector unions are helping the Koch brothers.
[02:34:50.873 --> 02:34:53.816]  So you have to ask yourself, which is a bigger leech?
[02:34:53.816 --> 02:34:56.057]  Omni, Wisconsin, and the national economy?
[02:34:56.057 --> 02:34:59.300]  The Koch brothers, or these government unions?
[02:34:59.300 --> 02:35:02.903]  The answer, obviously, is the Koch brothers, because they're tied into the New World Order.
[02:35:03.623 --> 02:35:13.887]  No, but that's what they're doing is the banksters are trying to get us to fight with each other over the crumbs instead of changing the overall architecture of the system.
[02:35:32.699 --> 02:35:34.060]  Agreed.
[02:35:34.060 --> 02:35:34.900]  We're totally in agreement.
[02:35:34.900 --> 02:35:37.242]  And Michael Moore doesn't understand that, in my opinion.
[02:35:37.242 --> 02:35:39.183]  Because he doesn't see the connection to the Koch brothers.
[02:35:39.183 --> 02:35:42.044]  He doesn't understand the way finance works.
[02:35:42.044 --> 02:35:43.906]  And he's an economic illiterate.
[02:35:43.906 --> 02:35:45.727]  That's why he made The Great Filmmaker.
[02:35:45.727 --> 02:35:48.628]  I thought Bowling for Columbine was a fantastic film.
[02:35:48.628 --> 02:35:50.669]  But when it comes to economics, he's tone deaf.
[02:35:50.669 --> 02:35:54.171]  He doesn't know anything that he's talking about.
[02:35:54.171 --> 02:35:58.674]  Well, Max, you don't agree with victim disarmament, do you?
[02:35:58.674 --> 02:36:00.395]  What does that mean?
[02:36:00.395 --> 02:36:01.836]  Restricting the Second Amendment.
[02:36:05.408 --> 02:36:24.455]  Well, as I said on your show before, Alex Jones, the Second Amendment, as it was iterated in the Constitution by the Founding Fathers, is there for a specific reason, which would be if the White House was taken over by tyrants, if you recall.
[02:36:24.455 --> 02:36:25.655]  That's why they put that in there.
[02:36:25.655 --> 02:36:33.197]  Yeah, imagine what would happen if the Egyptians would have firearms, then the secret police could be running roughshod over them.
[02:36:34.978 --> 02:36:35.979]  Well, there's two points there.
[02:36:35.979 --> 02:36:39.421]  First of all, in the Egyptian, there's no leaders and there's no violence.
[02:36:39.421 --> 02:36:45.265]  So, like a Gandhi-esque revolution, and by the way, people thought that could never happen again, but here we're staying in Cairo.
[02:36:45.265 --> 02:36:46.546]  You don't need weapons.
[02:36:46.546 --> 02:36:57.314]  But getting back to your point in the U.S., what I've said on your show now, two years ago, if that Second Amendment is there for a reason, and it's supposed to be triggered by certain events,
[02:36:58.268 --> 02:37:08.551]  Then I have to ask you and your listeners, what exactly are, you know, I mean, isn't the events foretold by the Founding Fathers, haven't they come to pass?
[02:37:08.551 --> 02:37:10.632]  I mean, what's the deal here?
[02:37:10.632 --> 02:37:14.053]  I mean, you just elected... Well, Max, that's easy for you.
[02:37:14.053 --> 02:37:16.134]  You've bugged out over there to Paris.
[02:37:17.434 --> 02:37:19.815]  I am part of the internet revolution.
[02:37:19.815 --> 02:37:21.796]  My influence, look at what happened to Stobo Price.
[02:37:21.796 --> 02:37:23.977]  Listen, I'm out of time.
[02:37:23.977 --> 02:37:26.438]  Now it's at 36 and a half.
[02:37:26.438 --> 02:37:27.538]  Max, I'm out of time.
[02:37:27.538 --> 02:37:34.401]  You know how many people have become rich and the revolution has been financed because of what we're saying right here.
[02:37:34.401 --> 02:37:35.841]  That's the revolution, my friend.
[02:37:37.602 --> 02:37:38.203]  We're good to go.
[02:37:55.037 --> 02:37:58.639]  The big European, British banks laundering Gaddafi's money.
[02:37:58.639 --> 02:38:03.501]  So since he wants me to play this, I will play it, but I've got to get to your questions or I'll never get to your calls.
[02:38:03.501 --> 02:38:05.781]  And I've got some economic news I want to hit.
[02:38:05.781 --> 02:38:11.644]  Something I covered two weeks ago and that I then didn't cover last week.
[02:38:11.644 --> 02:38:18.767]  Guys, you have that CBS clip with the ATF agent saying that he was ordered to let machine guns and things into Mexico.
[02:38:20.874 --> 02:38:23.275]  Find that for tomorrow because I want to lead with that.
[02:38:23.275 --> 02:38:32.201]  This is a lot of times there's big major stories that I barely mention, but it's been confirmed and we already saw this coming.
[02:38:32.201 --> 02:38:36.563]  In fact, I already said this two years ago, but now it's confirmed.
[02:38:36.563 --> 02:38:43.948]  Obama all over the US has ordered through Holder, the Attorney General, to allow
[02:38:45.945 --> 02:39:06.194]  Illegal guns to be shipped out of the US into Mexico so they can call for restricting the Second Amendment here because of what's happening in Mexico and you've now seen them call for making gun dealers report guns that they sell the ATF or restricting what guns they sell or how many guns they can sell outside of law.
[02:39:08.590 --> 02:39:14.513]  In the name of stopping the situation in Mexico, when they have a total gun ban down there.
[02:39:14.513 --> 02:39:35.465]  But the issue here is, you now have whistleblowers from inside the ATF confirming the government's trying to ensure more guns get down there, so they can then trace them back to the United States and demonize the Second Amendment, when the lion's share of the guns the Mexican cartels are using are being bought from the Mexican military.
[02:39:36.997 --> 02:39:39.080]  But here's an example of false flag.
[02:39:39.080 --> 02:39:43.487]  In fact, a week and a half ago, I sent these articles to Watson and Kurt.
[02:39:43.487 --> 02:39:48.034]  I know they're busy guys, but I said, please write a story on this.
[02:39:48.034 --> 02:39:51.519]  The headline should be Obama caught in false flag.
[02:39:53.880 --> 02:40:00.042]  Obama caught shipping guns to Mexico in Second Amendment false flags, something like that.
[02:40:00.042 --> 02:40:02.623]  I mean, here they are, red-handed.
[02:40:02.623 --> 02:40:04.364]  Where are the congressional hearings?
[02:40:04.364 --> 02:40:07.845]  Where are the investigations?
[02:40:07.845 --> 02:40:14.407]  One big thing that we have going against us here is that so much is happening and going on now that
[02:40:16.434 --> 02:40:20.618]  In the past, maybe one of these articles, I would have harped on it for three hours.
[02:40:20.618 --> 02:40:28.245]  Now there's so much incredible tyranny proving everything we've said that I don't even cover half of it.
[02:40:28.245 --> 02:40:28.525]  All right.
[02:40:30.912 --> 02:40:33.314]  Here's the clip from Max Keiser's TV show.
[02:40:33.314 --> 02:40:34.174]  This hasn't aired yet.
[02:40:34.174 --> 02:40:35.855]  This hasn't been seen yet.
[02:40:35.855 --> 02:40:37.496]  And so he was harping on it.
[02:40:37.496 --> 02:40:38.337]  Here it is.
[02:40:38.337 --> 02:40:39.897]  The dictator's dough.
[02:40:39.897 --> 02:40:43.640]  Astonishing wealth of Qaddafi and his family revealed.
[02:40:43.640 --> 02:40:53.885]  The astonishing wealth of Libyan tyrant Muammar Qaddafi and his family has been laid bare as countries around the world begin freezing billions of dollars worth of their assets.
[02:40:53.885 --> 02:40:54.586]  The U.S.
[02:40:54.586 --> 02:40:56.547]  alone has seized $30 billion.
[02:40:58.328 --> 02:41:05.332]  While Canada has frozen 2.4 billion, Austria 1.7 billion, and the UK 1 billion.
[02:41:05.332 --> 02:41:09.094]  And that money came in after the Patriot Act.
[02:41:09.094 --> 02:41:10.315]  A lot of it did.
[02:41:10.315 --> 02:41:11.055]  All of it, yeah.
[02:41:11.055 --> 02:41:16.258]  During a period of supposedly these new anti-money laundering, money for dictators laws.
[02:41:16.838 --> 02:41:20.299]  So here we have selective prosecution and a two-tier legal system.
[02:41:20.299 --> 02:41:23.480]  If you're a dictator, like Gaddafi, we'll take your money.
[02:41:23.480 --> 02:41:27.481]  We don't care who you kill, the name of America's donut franchises.
[02:41:27.481 --> 02:41:30.782]  But if you're a hard-working American, we treat you like garbage.
[02:41:30.782 --> 02:41:38.224]  We treat you like scum because we think you should be working as slaves on our Wall Street plantations.
[02:41:38.224 --> 02:41:39.185]  Of course you should revolt.
[02:41:39.185 --> 02:41:40.145]  What are you waiting for?
[02:41:40.305 --> 02:41:41.546]  Well, just as the U.S.
[02:41:41.546 --> 02:41:51.010]  Government Commission report into the military contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan said that it could be an understatement how much was looted and stolen, the same thing in this report.
[02:41:51.010 --> 02:41:58.614]  They're saying that these assets could be just the tip of the iceberg because that's the stuff that was in a, like, bank account with a number.
[02:41:58.614 --> 02:42:00.815]  They don't know where all the other wealth is hidden.
[02:42:01.075 --> 02:42:12.907]  Right, well, the first thing Americans should do is, en masse, a million or ten million should immediately pick a day in the future to coordinate, using a Facebook-type revolution, a million foreclosure walk-away.
[02:42:12.907 --> 02:42:15.570]  Just walk away from your mortgages.
[02:42:15.570 --> 02:42:18.733]  Because the banks that sold you those mortgages are financing terrorism.
[02:42:18.953 --> 02:42:28.041]  As a matter of fact, you would probably save lives by walking away from your mortgage, because every penny you give a Morgan or a Goldman Sachs, they just use it to fund terrorists and kill people and murder people and starve people.
[02:42:28.041 --> 02:42:31.744]  So do your species, the human species, a favor.
[02:42:31.744 --> 02:42:32.925]  Don't pay your mortgage.
[02:42:32.925 --> 02:42:35.788]  Don't give the cancerous terrorists any more of your money.
[02:42:35.788 --> 02:42:41.553]  Unless, of course, you want to live in a prison.
[02:42:41.553 --> 02:42:44.495]  Okay, there's that clip that Max sent over to us.
[02:42:46.874 --> 02:42:50.536]  Now continuing here with your Twitter questions.
[02:42:50.536 --> 02:42:58.321]  Twitter.com forward slash RealAlexJones if you want to follow us there on the site.
[02:42:58.321 --> 02:43:02.264]  Let me read over some of these very interesting questions we got.
[02:43:02.264 --> 02:43:04.265]  I'll try to answer these quickly.
[02:43:04.265 --> 02:43:07.747]  Utah gold and silver accepted as currency.
[02:43:07.747 --> 02:43:08.888]  What are the implications?
[02:43:09.687 --> 02:43:22.318]  The implications are all over the world gold and silver are emerging as the new world reserve currency as every major fiat currency is devalued in a coordinated fashion by the G20.
[02:43:24.606 --> 02:43:27.287]  So there is your answer on that front.
[02:43:27.287 --> 02:43:37.452]  People are really starting to get it and understand it and we're starting to get the first inklings of local control as we continue to educate the public.
[02:43:37.452 --> 02:43:40.353]  That was from Esther.
[02:43:41.640 --> 02:43:43.361]  Here's another Twitter question.
[02:43:43.361 --> 02:43:51.383]  A topic on your show or website should be about the German stock market and how they bought the New York Stock Exchange.
[02:43:51.383 --> 02:43:59.585]  Well, René, you must have missed it, but we have covered that in great detail, and it does show how this country is being completely bought out.
[02:43:59.585 --> 02:44:01.206]  Another important question.
[02:44:01.206 --> 02:44:06.167]  Why is the EPA considering regulating dust, yet quiet
[02:44:09.161 --> 02:44:11.615]  With all the toxins in the air, water, and food.
[02:44:14.033 --> 02:44:20.877]  Again, why is the EPA considering regulating dust yet quite alright with toxins in the air, water, food, and dust?
[02:44:20.877 --> 02:44:23.219]  Well, that's a way to shut down farming.
[02:44:23.219 --> 02:44:32.945]  They're saying if there's any dust, when you plow a field or pick cotton with a combine, if there's any dust, they're going to put fines on you.
[02:44:32.945 --> 02:44:36.347]  Then only big, major agribusiness can buy the waivers.
[02:44:36.347 --> 02:44:39.850]  So, it's another way to shut down our industry, shut down our operations.
[02:44:41.755 --> 02:44:50.437]  Just like Obama has given 1,040 waivers to major companies where they don't have to buy insurance, it's the same thing here.
[02:44:50.437 --> 02:45:05.281]  The globalists are giving the waivers, then the small farm, you're gonna have the control freak government bureaucrat coming on there saying that there was some dust or some mud from your cows walking around, ran into a stream, so they're gonna fine you.
[02:45:05.281 --> 02:45:08.062]  It's just feudalism, a way to shut down their competition.
[02:45:10.450 --> 02:45:13.551]  Here's another one by MythicMystic.
[02:45:13.551 --> 02:45:17.853]  If we marched on the Federal Reserve, we can be victorious.
[02:45:17.853 --> 02:45:21.534]  It will be the Ragnarok of the New World Order.
[02:45:21.534 --> 02:45:22.815]  Do you think we should?
[02:45:22.815 --> 02:45:24.715]  ASAP.
[02:45:24.715 --> 02:45:37.160]  Ragnarok is the final battle in the Guter Dammerung, for those that don't know, between good and evil in the Germanic end-of-the-world scenario, for those that don't know.
[02:45:37.160 --> 02:45:38.461]  If we march on the Fed,
[02:45:39.488 --> 02:45:41.909]  Reserve, we will be victorious.
[02:45:41.909 --> 02:45:44.389]  It will be the Ragnarok of the New World Order.
[02:45:44.389 --> 02:45:48.910]  Do you think we should ASAP?
[02:45:48.910 --> 02:45:57.552]  Well, you notice three years ago, and this is in the Obama deception, and when we went out to protest the Federal Reserve in Dallas peacefully, the army was there spying on us.
[02:45:57.552 --> 02:46:06.214]  They know that's the real government, that's the illegitimate criminals they work for, that's the foreign bankers that hijacked America, and so they had the army there.
[02:46:06.214 --> 02:46:07.614]  And yes, I think people
[02:46:08.752 --> 02:46:11.012]  Go and protest by the millions in D.C.
[02:46:11.012 --> 02:46:16.734]  and the politicians ignore you and the cops boss you around and it's all an exercise and serfdom.
[02:46:16.734 --> 02:46:20.775]  Everybody should be at New York Federal Reserve, Dallas Federal Reserve.
[02:46:20.775 --> 02:46:23.895]  You should be protesting these things 24-7.
[02:46:23.895 --> 02:46:26.556]  You should be hanging up flyers about them.
[02:46:26.556 --> 02:46:30.417]  You should be letting everybody know they are the evil occupational force.
[02:46:30.417 --> 02:46:31.657]  They are the problem.
[02:46:31.657 --> 02:46:32.657]  They are the crisis.
[02:46:32.657 --> 02:46:34.017]  They are the enemy.
[02:46:34.017 --> 02:46:35.758]  They are the illegitimate government.
[02:46:35.758 --> 02:46:36.778]  They are the fraudsters.
[02:46:37.478 --> 02:46:39.101]  Here's another one from Joe Hilarious.
[02:46:39.101 --> 02:46:40.745]  Oh, well those will actually go up overall.
[02:46:49.298 --> 02:46:58.487]  Because the stock market's denominated in dollars, predominantly, and so it'll take more dollars to buy the same stocks, and the yuppies won't figure that out.
[02:46:58.487 --> 02:46:59.829]  Here's another one.
[02:46:59.829 --> 02:47:04.414]  Did you hear about Amtrak barring TSA from some security operations?
[02:47:04.414 --> 02:47:12.402]  Yes, and Texas and a bunch of other states are moving to criminally charge TSA as the feds and their untrained goon force roll out nationwide.
[02:47:17.608 --> 02:47:21.110]  Okay, I'm just out of time now, because I promised Ted I'd take a few calls.
[02:47:21.110 --> 02:47:24.351]  But I wanted to shift gears to Ted Anderson just briefly.
[02:47:24.351 --> 02:47:29.654]  Ted, gold and silver have gone to all-new record highs today.
[02:47:29.654 --> 02:47:31.695]  Then there was some profit-taking at about $11.30.
[02:47:31.695 --> 02:47:34.457]  Then they shot right back up.
[02:47:34.457 --> 02:47:38.299]  That is, for me, studying this in the last 11 years of it going up,
[02:47:39.079 --> 02:47:41.621]  Usually profit takings for a couple days or even weeks.
[02:47:41.621 --> 02:47:45.064]  What does it mean that it would dip down and then shoot back up?
[02:47:45.064 --> 02:47:48.586]  I mean that shows me that gold and silver fever has only begun.
[02:47:48.586 --> 02:47:50.448]  Yeah you're right about that Alex.
[02:47:50.448 --> 02:47:55.912]  At about 11.30 there was some short selling that was occurring and it pushed the prices down lower than where they were.
[02:47:55.912 --> 02:47:56.933]  I mean this morning
[02:47:57.213 --> 02:48:00.234]  Silver hit a high of $36.71.
[02:48:00.234 --> 02:48:02.835]  We're almost at $37 silver.
[02:48:02.835 --> 02:48:09.337]  Do you realize just a week and a half ago, we were at $27 silver, almost up $10 in one week.
[02:48:09.337 --> 02:48:12.898]  I mean, gold hit a high today of $1,445.30.
[02:48:12.898 --> 02:48:17.419]  I mean, we're hitting market highs that have never been seen before in gold.
[02:48:17.419 --> 02:48:20.240]  Silver has to hit $50 before we can say that.
[02:48:20.560 --> 02:48:25.041]  But you have to go all the way back to 1980 when the Hunt brothers were manipulating.
[02:48:25.041 --> 02:48:26.622]  There's no question about it, Alex.
[02:48:26.622 --> 02:48:27.942]  This market's strong.
[02:48:27.942 --> 02:48:35.805]  I mean, at 11.30 today, the gold and silver market was dipping down below its opening price and whammo, right back up again.
[02:48:35.805 --> 02:48:43.207]  I mean, the manipulation just cannot control the price, even though they're trying so terribly hard to do it.
[02:48:43.607 --> 02:48:49.192]  And of course, here's another 6.7, I'm sorry, 6.6 billion purchased, again, U.S.
[02:48:49.192 --> 02:48:51.354]  Treasuries by the Federal Reserve System.
[02:48:51.354 --> 02:48:58.681]  Another assault against the United States dollar, as though if we're dropping below $77 on the index, now we're in the 76 range.
[02:48:58.681 --> 02:49:03.246]  I mean, we're free-falling, and we're falling faster than the other currencies are.
[02:49:03.246 --> 02:49:06.609]  Meanwhile, the media is telling us everything's fine with the economy.
[02:49:07.056 --> 02:49:07.917]  They sure are.
[02:49:07.917 --> 02:49:17.009]  I can tell you right now, Alex, all I can say is that people are way better off having silver than they are having this funny fiat money that the United States Treasury is putting out.
[02:49:17.009 --> 02:49:20.894]  And no better way to get it than to get your three videos on those silver dollars for $110.
[02:49:22.476 --> 02:49:24.377]  I just can't say it enough, man.
[02:49:24.377 --> 02:49:26.398]  Thousands of people are taking advantage of this.
[02:49:26.398 --> 02:49:28.779]  Your videos are being pushed out everywhere.
[02:49:28.779 --> 02:49:31.060]  And people are making copies and handing them out from there.
[02:49:31.060 --> 02:49:39.624]  It's like this, not only just a pebble in the pond and the ripple effect is going out, this is more like somebody's dropping a boulder in the pond and a tidal wave just occurred.
[02:49:39.624 --> 02:49:45.026]  Well, resistance is victory and now people are really listening to the films, the radio show.
[02:49:45.026 --> 02:49:46.627]  They're really paying attention because
[02:49:47.307 --> 02:49:50.449]  You know, we didn't just start covering this two years ago like Glenn Beck.
[02:49:50.449 --> 02:49:55.452]  We've been covering it for 16 years and in full spectrum analysis.
[02:49:55.452 --> 02:49:56.693]  And that's why it is important.
[02:49:56.693 --> 02:49:59.355]  Three silver dollars for $110.
[02:49:59.355 --> 02:50:05.659]  That's with the free shipping and the three films, Obama Deception, Fall of the Republic, Endgame on top of it.
[02:50:05.659 --> 02:50:06.139]  800-686-2237.
[02:50:06.139 --> 02:50:06.219]  800-686-2237.
[02:50:06.219 --> 02:50:07.920]  You gotta tell folks it's the radio special.
[02:50:15.765 --> 02:50:16.946]  to take advantage of that.
[02:50:34.597 --> 02:50:35.238]  We have eagles.
[02:50:35.238 --> 02:50:37.659]  I mean, the buffalo coin.
[02:50:37.659 --> 02:50:38.980]  I mean, whatever it is.
[02:50:38.980 --> 02:50:40.741]  The survival bags of dimes.
[02:50:40.741 --> 02:50:42.602]  What a smart investment that is.
[02:50:42.602 --> 02:50:46.725]  I mean, there's just a whole long line of things that you should be getting into at this particular time.
[02:50:46.725 --> 02:50:47.405]  Absolutely.
[02:50:47.405 --> 02:50:50.828]  And tell them it's the radio special to take advantage of the lower prices.
[02:50:50.828 --> 02:50:52.209]  Ted's got the best deals out there.
[02:50:52.209 --> 02:50:55.631]  Give them a call.
[02:50:55.631 --> 02:50:56.111]  800-686-2237.
[02:50:56.111 --> 02:50:58.173]  Thank you so much, Ted, for joining us.
[02:50:58.173 --> 02:50:58.653]  You bet, Alex.
[02:51:01.548 --> 02:51:08.475]  Imagine being free of debt in just 12 weeks without payment plans or negotiating or hiring an attorney.
[02:51:08.475 --> 02:51:14.420]  18 years ago we cracked the code of debt collections and set tens of thousands of people free of their debts.
[02:51:14.420 --> 02:51:18.184]  It's called Zero Debt Guaranteed and it works for all debts.
[02:51:18.516 --> 02:51:20.317]  My wages were being garnished.
[02:51:20.317 --> 02:51:25.121]  So I used the program and the attorney dropped the case and he returned my money within two weeks.
[02:51:25.121 --> 02:51:28.964]  With Zero Debt guaranteed, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[02:51:28.964 --> 02:51:31.046]  There is no other program of its kind.
[02:51:31.046 --> 02:51:33.228]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[02:51:33.228 --> 02:51:35.750]  Call our help desk for lightning fast assistance.
[02:51:36.030 --> 02:51:36.390]  Let's do it!
[02:52:12.592 --> 02:52:17.453]  So far over 6 million people have watched this free video online.
[02:52:17.453 --> 02:52:18.254]  Have you?
[02:52:18.254 --> 02:52:29.556]  Again, this big event has nothing to do with war or the stock market, yet it could change everything about your normal way of life, the way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your family.
[02:52:29.556 --> 02:52:30.736]  Could this really happen?
[02:52:30.736 --> 02:52:34.717]  Well, the man who created this video has been right about many predictions in his career.
[02:52:34.717 --> 02:52:39.718]  He was among the first to predict the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner.
[02:52:42.805 --> 02:52:43.225]  I don't know.
[02:53:01.573 --> 02:53:04.537]  If you suffer from poor sleep, you need MyPillow.
[02:53:04.537 --> 02:53:07.500]  Guaranteed to be the most comfortable pillow you will ever own.

[02:54:16.457 --> 02:54:18.959]  Well, I did the show today, despite the fact I'm under the weather.
[02:54:18.959 --> 02:54:20.480]  I should be 100% tomorrow.
[02:54:20.480 --> 02:54:29.306]  I have some very informative guests joining us, and I'm really wound up about the news, but couldn't really get my intellect firing today, but tomorrow I will.
[02:54:29.306 --> 02:54:34.409]  I didn't even really talk about Bill O'Reilly trying to demonize me last Friday.
[02:54:34.409 --> 02:54:36.611]  I'll do that tomorrow.
[02:54:36.611 --> 02:54:40.333]  There's just so much to cover, but I do want to jam in some phone calls right now.
[02:54:40.333 --> 02:54:42.335]  Bill in Connecticut, you're on the air.
[02:54:42.335 --> 02:54:42.695]  Welcome.
[02:54:44.198 --> 02:54:45.179]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[02:54:45.179 --> 02:54:48.562]  Thanks for making it in today and braving your illness.
[02:54:48.562 --> 02:54:49.523]  Oh, you bet.
[02:54:49.523 --> 02:54:51.145]  Wild horses couldn't draw me away.
[02:54:51.145 --> 02:54:52.146]  Go ahead.
[02:54:52.146 --> 02:54:55.269]  Yeah, you sound great, so I wouldn't worry about it.
[02:54:55.269 --> 02:55:02.376]  Regarding Max Keiser, is he unaware of what, of Ken Fromm's prediction four months ago?
[02:55:02.376 --> 02:55:05.139]  Because he seems like this is a spontaneous uprising.
[02:55:06.004 --> 02:55:06.824]  In the Middle East.
[02:55:06.824 --> 02:55:08.345]  You know, I'm glad you mentioned that.
[02:55:08.345 --> 02:55:09.686]  I meant to bring it up to him.
[02:55:09.686 --> 02:55:13.388]  In fact, I think I may even have brought it up to him.
[02:55:13.388 --> 02:55:14.329]  Did I?
[02:55:14.329 --> 02:55:17.290]  That Lindsey Williams said this was all going to be staged?
[02:55:17.290 --> 02:55:24.914]  You brought it up prior to getting him on the phone, but then you didn't bring it up directly with him once he got on.
[02:55:24.914 --> 02:55:28.136]  Look, the people are legitimately revolting.
[02:55:28.136 --> 02:55:30.397]  The point is it's part of a larger plan.
[02:55:30.397 --> 02:55:34.800]  It's part of the Middle East being in turmoil so the bankers can cheat them on their T-bills.
[02:55:39.649 --> 02:55:42.570]  One last point.
[02:55:42.570 --> 02:55:48.291]  You talked about this Google e-bomb which has worked quite effectively.
[02:55:48.291 --> 02:56:06.134]  But I was thinking of what about a congressional e-mail bomb where once a month we put together one of your writers or one of your articles could be amended to be posted as an e-mail to all the congressional leaders both in the House and the Senate.
[02:56:07.458 --> 02:56:11.521]  Maybe twice a month, once a month.
[02:56:11.521 --> 02:56:13.023]  I don't think that's a bad idea.
[02:56:13.023 --> 02:56:22.871]  The issue is there are hundreds of think tanks and lobbying groups who do have those lists, who do send out emails themselves.
[02:56:22.871 --> 02:56:24.813]  And so I can tell you a lot of it gets ignored.
[02:56:24.813 --> 02:56:30.758]  What doesn't get ignored is handwritten notes or phone calls to their offices.
[02:56:30.758 --> 02:56:31.578]  But it's a good idea.
[02:56:31.578 --> 02:56:34.341]  I appreciate the points, Bill.
[02:56:34.341 --> 02:56:35.442]  Resistance is victory.
[02:56:36.794 --> 02:56:39.035]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mary in Texas.
[02:56:39.035 --> 02:56:40.716]  Mary, you're on the air.
[02:56:40.716 --> 02:56:41.777]  Hi, Alex.
[02:56:41.777 --> 02:56:42.217]  Hey.
[02:56:42.217 --> 02:56:43.658]  I love listening to you.
[02:56:43.658 --> 02:56:47.960]  I date back to the APFN, if you know what that is.
[02:56:47.960 --> 02:56:53.282]  American Patriot Facts Network and Citizens for Legal Reform in Dallas.
[02:56:53.282 --> 02:57:01.406]  And I got on board due to WACO when I went to help everybody in WACO as much as I could and visiting people in jail and all this stuff in 93.
[02:57:01.406 --> 02:57:04.388]  That's how I got hooked up and learned what's really going on.
[02:57:05.453 --> 02:57:08.937]  And largely got scorned by everybody I knew.
[02:57:08.937 --> 02:57:13.602]  But thank goodness you're reaching a large amount of people and you're getting the word out.
[02:57:13.602 --> 02:57:15.844]  I have a couple of things to say.
[02:57:15.844 --> 02:57:19.508]  Don't anyone forget April the 19th.
[02:57:19.508 --> 02:57:21.790]  Let's all remember what happened.
[02:57:21.790 --> 02:57:25.654]  That was just a staging for what can happen to anyone else anytime.
[02:57:25.654 --> 02:57:27.156]  They were seeing if they could get away with it.
[02:57:27.156 --> 02:57:27.997]  It was a beta test.
[02:57:28.840 --> 02:57:31.241]  Right, and that's exactly what it was.
[02:57:31.241 --> 02:57:34.842]  And they even had people from Britain over looking at this.
[02:57:34.842 --> 02:57:36.063]  Oh, they even had Russians!
[02:57:36.063 --> 02:57:37.323]  It was all a laboratory.
[02:57:37.323 --> 02:57:45.506]  That was even in Newsweek, that they had Russian psychological warfare experts and British, and they all took part in the fun.
[02:57:45.506 --> 02:57:48.187]  It's all these governments against the people.
[02:57:48.187 --> 02:57:51.869]  It was, and people run over by tanks trying to get out.
[02:57:51.869 --> 02:57:55.690]  But anyway, also I just want to mention about Libya.
[02:57:57.019 --> 02:58:03.122]  There will be troops deployed there, and this information comes off of a social network site.
[02:58:03.122 --> 02:58:06.383]  A mother innocently saying that her son is being deployed.
[02:58:06.383 --> 02:58:10.665]  So, we can expect to see that.
[02:58:10.665 --> 02:58:18.808]  I don't doubt, I don't think this lady... Oh, they're massing the troops and ships and bases off the coast of Libya, so certainly.
[02:58:18.808 --> 02:58:20.449]  Anything else, Mary?
[02:58:20.449 --> 02:58:23.170]  That's it, just keep up the good work and remember April 19th.
[02:58:24.466 --> 02:58:37.315]  Absolutely, not only when they murdered those people at Waco and machine-gunned them, and then lied about it, and then got caught lying about it, but when the feds bombed the Alfred P. Murrow building to demonize the state's rights movement.
[02:58:37.315 --> 02:58:38.196]  Great job, crew.
[02:58:38.196 --> 02:58:39.557]  Great job, everybody.
[02:58:39.557 --> 02:58:40.097]  God bless you.
[02:58:40.097 --> 02:58:40.798]  See you back tomorrow.
