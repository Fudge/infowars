[00:00:06.101 --> 00:00:06.741]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.421 --> 00:00:08.442]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.182 --> 00:00:10.322]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.942 --> 00:00:11.762]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.543 --> 00:00:13.503]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.063 --> 00:00:17.684]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.264 --> 00:00:22.365]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:46.481]  It is Wednesday, the 13th day of July 2011, and we're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:47.242 --> 00:00:52.929]  Tony Farrell, who was a high-level counterterrorism analyst,
[00:00:54.273 --> 00:00:59.015]  for the South Yorkshire police in Britain from 98 to 2010.
[00:00:59.476 --> 00:01:06.219]  We'll be joining us dealing with government-sponsored terrorism coming up in the second hour today.
[00:01:06.279 --> 00:01:12.722]  Headline, police intelligence analyst fired for blowing whistle on false flag terror.
[00:01:13.522 --> 00:01:24.809]  And I thought then we would pull up some of the mainstream articles in Britain, where the IRA, it turns out, was run by British intelligence, the violent arm of it, as a pretext.
[00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:27.791]  And we even interviewed Agent Steakknife here on the broadcast.
[00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.930]  Here's another headline.
[00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.373]  A British double agent was real IRA, Omaha bomb team.
[00:01:35.073 --> 00:01:41.119]  It just goes through all of that information, how that was government-sponsored terror, the vast majority of it.
[00:01:41.519 --> 00:01:42.620]  So we'll be breaking that down.
[00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.084]  We'll also look at the supposed Muslim bombings of 7-7 and we'll look at 9-11.
[00:01:48.065 --> 00:01:54.410]  And of course that dovetails, unfortunately, quite nicely with the huge report that it turns out
[00:01:55.391 --> 00:02:15.274]  was on MSNBC last week and it was brought to our attention that this was hidden in plain view by a listener yesterday and the YouTube clip of the MSNBC piece is up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com bombshell Saudi and US governments protected hijackers.
[00:02:16.454 --> 00:02:28.316]  And that is from former Florida Governor Bob Graham, who said at least two of the purported 9-1-1 hijackers had assistance from Saudi Arabia.
[00:02:28.737 --> 00:02:33.138]  Graham's recently released novel, Keys of the Kingdom, implicates the Saudis.
[00:02:33.598 --> 00:02:37.118]  He told MSNBC the novel is based on factual information.
[00:02:37.798 --> 00:02:38.799]  So we're going to be going over that.
[00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:47.668]  The mainstream dinosaur dying media is focusing on the Saudi connection, which we have always covered, but the fact that Graham also said the U.S.
[00:02:47.728 --> 00:02:48.909]  government was protecting him.
[00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.830]  Well, no kidding.
[00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:50.892]  They were trained at U.S.
[00:02:51.092 --> 00:02:51.973]  military bases.
[00:02:53.014 --> 00:02:54.636]  And people don't want to look at these facts.
[00:02:54.656 --> 00:02:55.637]  They don't want to grow up.
[00:02:55.697 --> 00:03:00.143]  They don't want to face the fact that the federal government shipped tens of thousands of firearms into Mexico.
[00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:10.122]  To destabilize Mexico, to knock out their drug cartel competition, and to, of course, false flag blame the Second Amendment.
[00:03:10.998 --> 00:03:19.922]  We're going to be looking at government-sponsored terrorism coming up in depth in the second hour today because it is the ace in the hole the establishment has.
[00:03:20.342 --> 00:03:35.708]  We've damaged that ace, the ace is partially exposed, but I can look at the political juxtapositions, I can look at the political climate, and I can tell you unequivocally they're trying to resuscitate the 9-11 hoax and fairy tale
[00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:44.217]  Uh, and make believe Santa Claus story, Tooth Fairy story, because they want to invoke false flag terror again in a big way.
[00:03:44.717 --> 00:03:54.728]  And I'm not talking about provocateuring numbskulls out of prisons with the FBI leading groups, trying to get them to do bombings on Christmas Day and things like that, uh, with useful idiots.
[00:03:54.808 --> 00:03:56.190]  That's one type of staged terror.
[00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:05.376]  I'm talking about pure stage terror where there are no morons involved except for double agents who were set up and burned like 9-11.
[00:04:05.736 --> 00:04:09.098]  We know the hijackers were taking part in drills and were given U.S.
[00:04:09.138 --> 00:04:09.919]  government protection.
[00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.481]  That's on record, been on record for almost 10 years.
[00:04:13.885 --> 00:04:16.626]  Well actually we knew about it before 9-11 so it's longer than 10 years.
[00:04:17.506 --> 00:04:34.511]  So we're going to be going over all of that coming up in the second hour because the only way they're going to get their world government, the only way they're going to get their police state fully in place, the only way they're going to shell the population on living under tyranny is that it's being done for their safety because of terrorism.
[00:04:35.031 --> 00:04:37.292]  So we're going to be going over all of this today.
[00:04:37.992 --> 00:04:40.693]  Uh, you know, they're saying Qaddafi's gonna start terror attacks.
[00:04:40.753 --> 00:04:43.114]  And Qaddafi is under military attack.
[00:04:43.174 --> 00:04:46.915]  If he militarily strikes back at Europe, that's gonna be called a terror attack.
[00:04:46.955 --> 00:04:51.797]  And, of course, we'll have to give up more liberties because the establishment funded al-Qaeda to attack Qaddafi.
[00:04:52.197 --> 00:04:53.837]  And if he fights back, it's terrorism.
[00:04:54.258 --> 00:05:01.240]  And if you're not forgiving your rights up here with al-Qaeda, even though al-Qaeda's attacking Qaddafi, working for Northcom and the rest of them publicly.
[00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.622]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:05:05.942 --> 00:05:06.563]  Number one.
[00:05:06.863 --> 00:05:10.005]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:05:10.285 --> 00:05:10.845]  Number two.
[00:05:11.145 --> 00:05:15.688]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:05:16.028 --> 00:05:16.468]  It's true.
[00:05:16.768 --> 00:05:21.331]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:05:21.651 --> 00:05:22.191]  Number three.
[00:05:22.471 --> 00:05:25.753]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:05:26.053 --> 00:05:29.755]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:05:29.955 --> 00:05:30.515]  Number four.
[00:05:30.755 --> 00:05:33.116]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:05:33.516 --> 00:05:36.897]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:05:37.197 --> 00:05:37.737]  Number five.
[00:05:37.977 --> 00:05:41.898]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:05:42.118 --> 00:05:46.900]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.201]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:51.361 --> 00:05:52.902]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:53.142 --> 00:05:57.743]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[00:05:58.063 --> 00:05:58.904]  877-327-0365.
[00:06:01.685 --> 00:06:07.109]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:13.113]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:06:13.493 --> 00:06:20.278]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:24.101]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:06:26.254 --> 00:06:28.524]  I guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:06:30.698 --> 00:06:34.560]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.402]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[00:06:39.122 --> 00:06:39.903]  Others don't.
[00:06:40.363 --> 00:06:42.244]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:06:42.504 --> 00:06:44.025]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[00:06:44.285 --> 00:06:46.846]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:06:47.166 --> 00:06:53.430]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:56.011]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:06:56.511 --> 00:06:58.532]  Diamond gusset jeans got it.
[00:06:58.872 --> 00:06:59.373]  Others don't.
[00:07:05.171 --> 00:07:06.112]  Tyranny is here.
[00:07:06.433 --> 00:07:10.016]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:07:10.297 --> 00:07:12.579]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:18.045]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:07:18.465 --> 00:07:24.712]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:07:25.132 --> 00:07:30.677]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:07:31.077 --> 00:07:34.760]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.284]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:07:39.564 --> 00:07:45.109]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:07:45.529 --> 00:07:48.491]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:07:49.072 --> 00:07:50.513]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:07:51.053 --> 00:07:51.494]  It's here.

[00:08:11.083 --> 00:08:11.903]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.684 --> 00:08:13.684]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:14.224 --> 00:08:17.846]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.427 --> 00:08:22.529]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:32.964 --> 00:08:34.608]  It is Wednesday, the 13th day of July, 2011.
[00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:37.655]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:50.385]  Let me just give you a brief overview of the news we have in front of us here.
[00:08:51.546 --> 00:09:11.602]  We have, of course, Obama saying that he cannot guarantee that Social Security checks will go out August 3rd if you don't capitulate to the banksters and let the United States completely collapse into third world banana republic status.
[00:09:13.422 --> 00:09:40.525]  Also, continuing, I have these quotes out of the Huffington Post, but I don't ever believe anything they say, so I checked it, it's also in the Associated Press, that Senator Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republicans in the Senate, came out yesterday and proposed, now Republicans refused to go along with it, so he had to back off, but the point is he proposed for Congress to give up the power of the purse
[00:09:41.286 --> 00:09:48.171]  And to transfer its power to levy taxes, to sign on to foreign debts to the President.
[00:09:50.192 --> 00:09:50.773]  And why not?
[00:09:50.853 --> 00:09:57.117]  Congress has already handed over the power to make war to the President, the power to set up carbon taxes and regulations to the President.
[00:09:57.458 --> 00:10:04.523]  The President is announcing, he announced Friday, that in the next few weeks they're going to sign executive orders to restrict the Second Amendment.
[00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:12.876]  And they add this Orwellian flourish to the end of the statement the White House Communications Director did last Friday, that this will be something we can all agree upon.
[00:10:13.576 --> 00:10:17.059]  Putting folks on a no-gun-by list, just like the no-fly list.
[00:10:17.559 --> 00:10:18.560]  Extrajudiciary.
[00:10:19.441 --> 00:10:29.809]  No facts, no reason, no judge, no jury, no recourse, no day in court, just you don't own guns anymore, bubba.
[00:10:30.945 --> 00:10:55.950]  And even on the heels of Fast and Furious, being admitted to be a federal program run by the Justice Department, with the Attorney General Eric Holder perjuring himself, now it turns out the FBI, DEA are involved, not just ATF, in helping ship the guns into Mexico directly to Las Zetas, the cartel trained by the Pentagon, and of course, School of America is in Fort Benning, Georgia.
[00:10:57.229 --> 00:10:57.830]  They don't care.
[00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:12.185]  They now have expanded the program that we told you they would expand, ordering gun shops from Texas through New Mexico, Arizona, California, that when someone buys high-powered rifles, to quote, report them to the ATF.
[00:11:12.226 --> 00:11:13.927]  Now that's a sick joke.
[00:11:14.928 --> 00:11:22.716]  Of course, ladies and gentlemen, it's like the government telling you what type of light bulbs you can have, or what type of toilet you can have, or what type of paint you can have.
[00:11:24.298 --> 00:11:27.161]  It's all about you just following orders outside of law.
[00:11:28.102 --> 00:11:30.584]  Because there is no law that you've got to do that with the ATF.
[00:11:30.924 --> 00:11:34.948]  They know full well there's already the instant check that grew out of the five-day waiting period.
[00:11:36.226 --> 00:11:52.480]  Where they run a background check for felonies and warrants when you go and buy any firearm, and it lists how many firearms you're buying, handguns, rifles, shotguns, and they know exactly what you're getting.
[00:11:53.221 --> 00:11:58.265]  Instantly in the NICS system, in the computer, when you call, you talk to an FBI operator.
[00:11:58.985 --> 00:12:01.147]  I've been there many times, buying,
[00:12:02.148 --> 00:12:03.991]  A firearm, and that's how they do it.
[00:12:04.071 --> 00:12:05.453]  Everybody who's bought a gun knows that.
[00:12:05.834 --> 00:12:15.688]  So why would the ATF say, well now when you're selling high-powered rifles, which they consider to be anything above a .22 caliber, and somebody's buying these, you need to go ahead and call us.
[00:12:18.288 --> 00:12:23.411]  That is simply allowing them to trigger an investigation so they can come out to your house and harass you.
[00:12:23.852 --> 00:12:29.836]  We've already seen cases in the last decade of ATF visiting people that buy, quote, more than 500 rounds of ammo.
[00:12:30.256 --> 00:12:31.117]  I've seen it in Texas.
[00:12:31.137 --> 00:12:32.037]  I've seen it in New York.
[00:12:32.558 --> 00:12:35.339]  They also have deputized sheriff's deputies in many counties.
[00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:38.181]  They will come out and ask, why'd you buy 1,000 rounds of ammo?
[00:12:38.702 --> 00:12:42.004]  Well, because ammo keeps going up in price, and I want to have plenty of .308 ammo.
[00:12:43.285 --> 00:12:44.446]  Why are you here at my house?
[00:12:45.526 --> 00:12:46.487]  I have no criminal record.
[00:12:46.507 --> 00:12:48.669]  I mean, don't you have criminals to deal with?
[00:12:49.289 --> 00:12:51.871]  They're like, how about you just let us in your house, Mr. Johnson?
[00:12:52.552 --> 00:12:54.834]  I remember seeing this six, seven years ago in Dallas, Texas.
[00:12:54.854 --> 00:12:59.217]  Dallas Morning News reported that they have knock and talk.
[00:13:00.058 --> 00:13:03.100]  And now in Boston and New York, they actually force their way in without a warrant.
[00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:07.324]  But first, it's a federal grant for local police to train them.
[00:13:07.704 --> 00:13:11.267]  First, they just knock and say, we'd like to come in and check your guns, make sure they're safe.
[00:13:11.727 --> 00:13:13.129]  Would you like us to look at your guns, ma'am?
[00:13:13.649 --> 00:13:19.611]  They always do it in the middle of the day, middle class areas, and a lot of women get scared and go ahead and let the cops in.
[00:13:19.671 --> 00:13:26.952]  I mean, this is just training the cops, acclimating the media, the public, that cops come to your house to talk about your guns, your legal guns.
[00:13:27.973 --> 00:13:32.814]  Handgun Control Incorporated admits that's what the federal grants for gun buyback programs are about.
[00:13:33.314 --> 00:13:39.177]  When they say, bring your guns in, and it's almost always old ladies, their husband has died or gone to the nursing home.
[00:13:39.657 --> 00:13:51.362]  I've seen cases of shotguns that are worth more than $10,000, finely carved collector's items, just being given to the cops for a $50 coupon, and the cops are laughing.
[00:13:51.722 --> 00:13:55.344]  And in a lot of cities, the cops you've seen end up getting in trouble.
[00:13:56.004 --> 00:13:57.525]  Because, quite frankly, I don't blame them.
[00:13:58.046 --> 00:14:04.350]  I'm not saying they should do this, but I don't blame them that they don't destroy them, they end up keeping them for themselves and selling them.
[00:14:04.771 --> 00:14:08.293]  And it's like police bustards selling guns from buyback.
[00:14:08.353 --> 00:14:19.222]  Well, if an old lady brings in a finely carved, double-barreled, 50-something-year-old shotgun worth $10,000, I mean, it's a crime to destroy those guns.
[00:14:19.502 --> 00:14:21.643]  I'm not saying the cops should be selling it out the back door.
[00:14:22.084 --> 00:14:24.586]  They shouldn't be doing it in the beginning.
[00:14:25.543 --> 00:14:33.626]  I mean, if the old lady comes up with a $10,000 shotgun, you should say, you might want a $1,000 AR-15, whatever the case is.
[00:14:33.646 --> 00:14:36.026]  You know, they've got a lot of specialty guns out there.
[00:14:37.047 --> 00:14:37.667]  Don't do it.
[00:14:38.267 --> 00:14:48.210]  I've seen cases of people turning in Civil War collector North and South rifles that are worth thousands of dollars.
[00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:50.771]  I mean, it is almost always
[00:14:51.983 --> 00:15:00.349]  Men who marry women who were anti-gun, the man dies, or the man's in the nursing home, and the poor dingbat goes in.
[00:15:00.369 --> 00:15:03.511]  Alright, see, I've got all this news to cover, I'm already digressing.
[00:15:04.131 --> 00:15:06.173]  The issue here is that
[00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:18.684]  They are now unveiling, oh we have a new ATF rule, not a congressional law, the ATF says, when somebody buys a high power rifle, you call us.
[00:15:18.844 --> 00:15:20.505]  The ATF says.
[00:15:20.965 --> 00:15:28.468]  And the next, now the ATF says this, and Obama says, there's not a law, Obama says his regulators, who are former
[00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:34.623]  Presidents of GE, they get to keep their power plants, but yours are shut down.
[00:15:34.903 --> 00:15:37.124]  And they're publicly giving themselves waivers.
[00:15:37.465 --> 00:15:39.486]  This is mafia government.
[00:15:39.526 --> 00:15:41.007]  This is dictatorship.
[00:15:41.027 --> 00:15:42.207]  And so I'll cover this now.
[00:15:42.768 --> 00:15:44.209]  Then I'm going to get into U.S.
[00:15:44.229 --> 00:15:49.472]  Senator calls for News Corp probe on the hacking over in England by Rupert Murdoch's people.
[00:15:50.791 --> 00:15:52.972]  Also, gold is at an all-time high.
[00:15:53.732 --> 00:16:00.034]  As of this morning, Kurt had gold close to breaking record as Eurozone debt crisis worsens.
[00:16:00.094 --> 00:16:01.255]  It has now broken that.
[00:16:01.295 --> 00:16:02.635]  It's right up at 1,000.
[00:16:06.405 --> 00:16:11.987]  500 and right at $90 or right below it, silver's also rocketing upwards.
[00:16:12.027 --> 00:16:13.308]  We told you that was going to happen.
[00:16:13.588 --> 00:16:21.330]  They do these manipulations in the paper market to drive it down, but then every time it retraces its previous heights and eclipses those.
[00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:23.011]  We're going to be breaking that down today.
[00:16:24.111 --> 00:16:26.353]  We've got an incredible guest joining us.
[00:16:26.393 --> 00:16:37.399]  He was the top analyst in a major British police department on terror threat matrix prediction systems and his research found it's the government staging the real
[00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:39.771]  Large-scale terror attacks.
[00:16:40.511 --> 00:16:49.298]  His findings were there are low-scale, low-tech Muslim terrorists, no kidding, who do attack on occasion, but it's very rare.
[00:16:49.338 --> 00:16:52.200]  It's like finding, you know, a leprechaun in your backyard.
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:17:00.405]  It's entering the realm of fantasy, but some say Santa Claus does exist, and that it's the government doing it.
[00:17:00.425 --> 00:17:06.429]  So he'll be joining us, and of course, former Florida governor Bob Graham
[00:17:07.782 --> 00:17:11.186]  Came out one of the head commissioners on the 9-11 Commission and said the U.S.
[00:17:11.206 --> 00:17:16.972]  government and Saudi government were protecting and funding at least two of the hijackers.
[00:17:17.813 --> 00:17:20.994]  And everybody's like, ooh, Alex, you're right!
[00:17:21.514 --> 00:17:22.594]  Wow, how'd you know this?
[00:17:22.794 --> 00:17:24.895]  Well, Graham wrote this five years ago.
[00:17:25.435 --> 00:17:27.135]  This was in the Washington Post three years ago.
[00:17:28.496 --> 00:17:40.819]  But I have Newsweek, I have the Sacramento Bee, I have the Associated Press, I have the San Jose Mercury News, I have the FBI agents in Phoenix and Minneapolis-St.
[00:17:40.879 --> 00:17:44.420]  Paul and Norman, Oklahoma and Dallas, Texas.
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:45.961]  I don't
[00:18:01.761 --> 00:18:02.522]  Heads of the U.S.
[00:18:02.602 --> 00:18:05.624]  embassies are saying they were ordered to let them into the U.S.
[00:18:05.664 --> 00:18:06.324]  and that they were U.S.
[00:18:06.425 --> 00:18:06.725]  agents.
[00:18:08.366 --> 00:18:15.211]  Colonels that headed up spy schools said that the hijackers were in their classes.
[00:18:15.951 --> 00:18:17.653]  Newsweek reports they were at U.S.
[00:18:17.713 --> 00:18:18.513]  Air Force bases.
[00:18:18.553 --> 00:18:19.874]  Here, I've got big stacks.
[00:18:19.954 --> 00:18:20.755]  It's all confirmed.
[00:18:21.756 --> 00:18:23.457]  They were let in by the government, protected.
[00:18:23.797 --> 00:18:28.340]  Dr. James Woods saw Mohammed Adda and others doing drills on the plane like hijacking.
[00:18:29.421 --> 00:18:32.424]  And, uh, he tried to warn the government they didn't want to talk to him.
[00:18:32.504 --> 00:18:36.388]  It was five days before 9-11, or six days before 9-11.
[00:18:36.428 --> 00:18:43.614]  I mean, Adda and others were running drills, just like the TSA, you know, does drills of sneaking bombs through.
[00:18:44.195 --> 00:18:51.261]  You better watch out, by the way, if you're DEA, FBI, CIA, SEAL Team 6, who does drills through the airports.
[00:18:51.662 --> 00:18:52.703]  This is how they'll do it.
[00:18:53.757 --> 00:19:05.860]  Especially if you're, quote, part of the new Muslim brigades that our military, our government, our supposed government has set up, quote, we want to report, recruit you American Muslims to join the CIA.
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.101]  You see the ads on TV.
[00:19:07.421 --> 00:19:09.741]  We need you to help fight extremism.
[00:19:10.182 --> 00:19:15.443]  And really what they're doing is they're getting a gaggle of patsies so they can have you go on board a plane to do a drill.
[00:19:15.463 --> 00:19:18.584]  They're going to blow that plane out of the sky and you're going to be all over the news.
[00:19:19.284 --> 00:19:26.750]  And your parents will come out and say, you know, Ahmed was recruited out of college to join the CIA, and the media is just going to laugh at you.
[00:19:27.931 --> 00:19:34.616]  And it won't matter, you know, if their college buddy comes out and says, no, you know, Ahmed was recruited into the CIA three years ago.
[00:19:35.176 --> 00:19:38.799]  Well, his roommate's going to walk out and be hit by a car that day.
[00:19:40.563 --> 00:19:42.905]  I mean, that's how they roll.
[00:19:43.466 --> 00:19:44.787]  They roll that way.
[00:19:45.628 --> 00:19:57.260]  And I know it's fun to be scared of the terrorists and hide under your table all day, but no one can deny, and former Homeland Security head Governor Ridge admitted two years ago, that he was ordered to issue fake terror alerts for political purposes.
[00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:01.344]  So, regardless of what you think is an inside job, they're using it to take our freedoms.
[00:20:01.624 --> 00:20:07.268]  HempUSA.org has moved and expanded its operations for faster worldwide shipping.

[00:20:30.763 --> 00:20:40.029]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:20:40.089 --> 00:20:40.810]  This capitalism?
[00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:47.014]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:20:47.154 --> 00:20:47.975]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:20:48.015 --> 00:20:51.117]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.

[00:23:00.629 --> 00:23:01.109]  Question.
[00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:05.392]  Can functional magnetic resonance imaging be used to read our minds?
[00:23:06.053 --> 00:23:11.477]  Author Jose Calazo answers yes in his two new books, America's New Slavery.
[00:23:11.757 --> 00:23:17.241]  For more than 13 years, author Jose Calazo has been trying to prove that the U.S.
[00:23:17.281 --> 00:23:22.385]  government has the capacity to read a person's thoughts with a revolutionary technology
[00:23:22.685 --> 00:23:28.710]  Known as FMRI, Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and there is proof that it exists.
[00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:35.675]  America's New Slavery explores this technology and its many possible applications in national security.
[00:23:35.936 --> 00:23:37.177]  Who has access to it?
[00:23:37.537 --> 00:23:38.658]  How is it being used?
[00:23:38.958 --> 00:23:42.000]  Does America's salvation rest in this technology?
[00:23:42.281 --> 00:23:48.946]  These and many other questions are answered in America's New Slavery, the new books by Jose Collazo.
[00:23:49.386 --> 00:23:54.268]  Available on BN.com, Amazon.com, and Borders.com.
[00:23:54.648 --> 00:23:56.329]  America's New Slavery.
[00:23:56.749 --> 00:23:58.930]  All Americans should be concerned.
[00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:10.154]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:24:10.214 --> 00:24:10.954]  Bombshell.
[00:24:11.475 --> 00:24:12.215]  Saudi and U.S.
[00:24:12.255 --> 00:24:13.956]  governments protected hijackers.
[00:24:14.556 --> 00:24:16.857]  That's from 9-11 Commissioner Bob Graham.
[00:24:18.134 --> 00:24:19.655]  But that's always been known.
[00:24:20.435 --> 00:24:21.536]  They were trained at U.S.
[00:24:21.556 --> 00:24:22.416]  military bases.
[00:24:22.776 --> 00:24:23.637]  They were protected.
[00:24:25.338 --> 00:24:25.718]  The U.S.
[00:24:25.778 --> 00:24:30.861]  embassies, when they were coming back into the U.S., were told, in Saudi Arabia, these men work for the CIA.
[00:24:31.301 --> 00:24:32.201]  Let them back in.
[00:24:32.221 --> 00:24:35.223]  They're in the terror files as their political cover.
[00:24:38.257 --> 00:24:40.539]  Yeah, they're at the topless bars, they're partying.
[00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:48.386]  They've got Mossad and FBI paying for their credit cards in San Diego and renting them their houses.
[00:24:51.569 --> 00:24:53.871]  But I know, 9-11 wasn't an inside job.
[00:24:54.151 --> 00:24:54.912]  I understand.
[00:24:55.472 --> 00:24:58.595]  There's just all the videos of cops saying, get back, they're going to blow up Building 7.
[00:24:59.876 --> 00:25:05.101]  BBC cuts to Building 7 as it stands and says, Building 7 has fallen from fires into its own footprint.
[00:25:06.135 --> 00:25:07.415]  Twenty-five minutes before it fell.
[00:25:07.895 --> 00:25:09.616]  Oops, we got that little memo early.
[00:25:09.996 --> 00:25:10.956]  Oh, there it goes.
[00:25:11.096 --> 00:25:12.056]  Ha ha, yes.
[00:25:12.596 --> 00:25:12.856]  Yes.
[00:25:13.256 --> 00:25:20.018]  Oh, oh, and the government didn't ship tens of thousands of guns into Mexico to the crime cartels to then blame the Second Amendment.
[00:25:20.678 --> 00:25:22.398]  Oh, and they don't care that they've been caught.
[00:25:23.419 --> 00:25:24.559]  They don't care they've been caught.
[00:25:24.839 --> 00:25:29.720]  They went ahead and announced the new gun control, that the executive orders are coming to restrict the Second Amendment.
[00:25:30.507 --> 00:25:35.094]  Outside of law, the president just says so, and the ATF's got new rules for gun shops.
[00:25:35.434 --> 00:25:37.797]  There's no law, but they say so!
[00:25:38.999 --> 00:25:41.322]  And don't look for Republicans to point this out.
[00:25:42.014 --> 00:25:44.655]  No, they're going to say, how dare you ship the guns in?
[00:25:45.275 --> 00:25:46.335]  How dare you do this?
[00:25:46.755 --> 00:25:48.036]  Oh, and then lie about it.
[00:25:48.756 --> 00:25:50.156]  Lie to Congress and say they didn't.
[00:25:50.536 --> 00:25:55.498]  Even when holders caught lying, they're like, well, we better leave this alone because they got dirt on us.
[00:25:55.978 --> 00:25:58.158]  You notice Bill Clinton was protected by George Bush.
[00:25:58.859 --> 00:26:02.240]  Obama's protecting George W. Bush on the torture and all the rest of it.
[00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:06.881]  Because they all work for the same interest at the end of the day.
[00:26:08.303 --> 00:26:10.144]  And I want to get to this news item.
[00:26:10.624 --> 00:26:28.050]  Yesterday, Republican leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, came out with a letter to the President proposing that the power of the purse, Article 1, Section 7 and 8 of the Constitution, be transferred entirely to the President.
[00:26:29.079 --> 00:26:32.222]  And they solve this like, ooh, that's a skillful political move.
[00:26:32.903 --> 00:26:38.288]  We'll let him do it and get us more into debt and bankrupt us, and then we'll blame him.
[00:26:38.368 --> 00:26:40.229]  Like winning political points is what matters.
[00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:45.794]  And that's only for the camp follower Republicans that feel like they're big political analysts and smart.
[00:26:46.155 --> 00:26:49.858]  No, this is the ongoing agenda to transfer power into the executive.
[00:26:50.259 --> 00:26:52.701]  What do we see Republicans and Democrats do under Bill Clinton?
[00:26:54.019 --> 00:27:00.407]  Sign most of Congress's authority over to the private World Trade Organization over our trade.
[00:27:01.088 --> 00:27:00.407]  1996.
[00:27:02.890 --> 00:27:04.231]  What did we see with the Glass-Steagalls?
[00:27:04.331 --> 00:27:12.922]  Sign over all power to the banks to control and the Federal Reserve to control the issuance of currency and credit.
[00:27:14.142 --> 00:27:22.045]  That happened to a certain extent in 1913 with the full transference with the Glass-Steagall and other acts that were gotten rid of in 1998-1999.
[00:27:22.566 --> 00:27:24.546]  So it's this continued transference.
[00:27:24.586 --> 00:27:34.851]  These guys are there as traitors, treasonous, and I'm not just using those words, that's what it is, to transfer the power of the Congress, the lawmakers,
[00:27:36.345 --> 00:27:38.709]  Well, Obama is the lawmaker now.
[00:27:38.969 --> 00:27:44.738]  Congress are the warmakers, the lawmakers, the tax raisers, the deciders on debt.
[00:27:45.178 --> 00:27:52.029]  And in case you don't believe me, I'm now going to read from the archaic
[00:27:54.076 --> 00:27:54.877]  Constitution.
[00:27:55.037 --> 00:28:02.262]  You know, that thing that we've seen the last few months, every major publication, including the statesman here in Austin, saying it's time to get rid of that Constitution.
[00:28:02.282 --> 00:28:06.705]  Yeah, private property, due process, checks and balances, separation of power.
[00:28:07.286 --> 00:28:10.968]  Yeah, that's why we need states, why we need a Congress, why we need courts.
[00:28:11.789 --> 00:28:14.230]  Because we've got an imperial presidency.
[00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:18.232]  And again, the media will say Jones claims Obama will be a dictator.
[00:28:18.272 --> 00:28:18.472]  No.
[00:28:18.832 --> 00:28:31.158]  The office is becoming a dictatorship of the bureaucracy and the special interests that own it and run it, and whose alumni sit in all the positions of power and regulatory authority.
[00:28:32.748 --> 00:28:36.009]  It's fully made up of these corporate, non-free market pirates.
[00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:45.513]  Article 1, Section 7 deals with spending bills arising in the House, going to the Senate, for the power of levying taxes, debts, things like that.
[00:28:45.953 --> 00:28:47.794]  Now, Section 8 gets even more specific.
[00:28:48.194 --> 00:28:59.039]  The Congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises to pay the debts, the debts, and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States.
[00:29:00.159 --> 00:29:10.348]  Yeah, how about Obama's forced health care, which is a tax, and he gives his buddies waivers.
[00:29:10.428 --> 00:29:11.529]  That's not uniform, is it?
[00:29:11.609 --> 00:29:11.809]  No.
[00:29:12.329 --> 00:29:14.511]  To borrow money on the credit of the United States.
[00:29:15.452 --> 00:29:16.513]  Of course, borrowing money.
[00:29:16.533 --> 00:29:18.694]  See, a president can be bought off by a foreign power.
[00:29:18.734 --> 00:29:22.718]  That happened a lot in Europe with kings and princes and even elected leaders.
[00:29:23.178 --> 00:29:27.722]  So they go on to say the president can't sign deals getting us into debt.
[00:29:28.422 --> 00:29:47.972]  The President can't raise debt ceilings, and it says, to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states, and with the Indian tribes, establish a uniform rule of naturalization, and it goes in to say that they control the coinage, the issuance of weights and measures, currencies, that the Congress is the boss of the military, of everything.
[00:29:48.412 --> 00:29:50.674]  But they teach the military that the President's the boss!
[00:29:51.534 --> 00:29:52.435]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.935 --> 00:29:54.436]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.439 --> 00:29:58.327]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.198 --> 00:30:02.418]  Hello.
[00:30:04.718 --> 00:30:05.258]  We're good to go.
[00:30:28.712 --> 00:30:29.392]  We're good to go.
[00:30:49.281 --> 00:30:49.801]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:30:49.861 --> 00:30:54.023]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:30:54.063 --> 00:30:56.424]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:17.334]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:31:17.514 --> 00:31:20.317]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:31:20.557 --> 00:31:22.659]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:31:22.879 --> 00:31:28.824]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:31:29.144 --> 00:31:32.347]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:31:32.527 --> 00:31:33.928]  Recently, he created a video.
[00:31:34.048 --> 00:31:34.268]  We're good.
[00:31:59.198 --> 00:32:00.900]  That's endofamerica3.com.
[00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:05.363]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:32:05.684 --> 00:32:09.767]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:32:10.027 --> 00:32:15.412]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:32:15.772 --> 00:32:16.212]  It's true.
[00:32:16.512 --> 00:32:21.934]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:22.214 --> 00:32:25.496]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:32:25.796 --> 00:32:30.258]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:32:30.518 --> 00:32:32.878]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:32:33.279 --> 00:32:36.600]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:41.642]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:32:41.882 --> 00:32:46.645]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:32:46.925 --> 00:32:50.966]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:51.107 --> 00:32:52.667]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:52.887 --> 00:32:57.490]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:33:08.374 --> 00:33:09.155]  Big Brother.
[00:33:10.496 --> 00:33:12.117]  Mainstream media.
[00:33:13.258 --> 00:33:14.399]  Government cover-ups.
[00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:16.841]  You want answers?
[00:33:17.801 --> 00:33:19.463]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:19.703 --> 00:33:26.028]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:30.651 --> 00:33:36.196]  Okay, so finishing up on the latest bit of treason.
[00:33:37.512 --> 00:33:53.242]  As the Congress, the lawmakers, the tax authorities transfer or attempt to transfer whatever power they've got left illegally to the president, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell floated a novel way
[00:33:54.696 --> 00:33:56.216]  Out of the default, Tuesday.
[00:33:56.236 --> 00:33:59.677]  Well, no, that's what the IMF and World Bank prefer, is a dictatorship.
[00:34:00.177 --> 00:34:11.300]  Suggesting that Congress give up its power to raise the debt ceiling and instead effectively transfer that authority and the political pain that comes with it to the White House for the remainder of Obama's current term.
[00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:15.541]  But then they quote, rather, Republicans here in these articles.
[00:34:18.601 --> 00:34:32.828]  Saying the proposal is not only likely unconstitutional, it is the worst possible strategy for Republicans who promised to fight the debt to now instead give the president unilateral power to borrow to his heart's content.
[00:34:35.130 --> 00:34:38.431]  The McConnell plan is full surrender, the white flag approach.
[00:34:39.012 --> 00:34:40.412]  And that is exactly what it is.
[00:34:41.633 --> 00:34:46.876]  Mitch McConnell, that I hear conservatives hailing constantly, makes me want to throw up.
[00:34:47.881 --> 00:34:50.824]  Yeah, why not give the World Trade Organization the authority over our trade?
[00:34:51.464 --> 00:34:55.528]  Why not let the President launch wars if he wants to without getting authorization from Congress?
[00:34:56.049 --> 00:35:05.398]  I mean, where is Congress blocking Obama having the EPA go around and shut down all of General Electric's competition in coal power plants?
[00:35:06.439 --> 00:35:12.825]  Headline, three months ago, Secretary of Energy, we're going to shut down massive amounts of coal plants.
[00:35:14.761 --> 00:35:19.845]  Headline the same day, Wall Street Journal, Obama signs waivers for General Electric.
[00:35:21.967 --> 00:35:29.773]  Obama issues waivers to McDonald's and over 2,000 other firms that don't have to buy insurance for their employees, but I'm not exempt.
[00:35:30.094 --> 00:35:31.575]  These rules are going in this year.
[00:35:33.556 --> 00:35:38.881]  Think about that, separate from whether the healthcare law is legitimate or not, and obviously it isn't.
[00:35:40.919 --> 00:35:52.962]  And I know I harp on this out of everything almost every day because, folks, this is a new level of open corruption, where all of the president's contributors are exempt from the garbage they bring down on us.
[00:35:53.022 --> 00:35:54.143]  That is dictatorship.
[00:35:54.523 --> 00:35:58.144]  If you study the Nazis, that is exactly what went on under Hitler.
[00:35:59.324 --> 00:36:00.424]  It's corporate fascism.
[00:36:02.205 --> 00:36:10.087]  They would pass all these regulations, and then Nazi companies were exempt, and in just a few years there were no companies but Nazi companies.
[00:36:13.922 --> 00:36:17.424]  That's the type of system we're going under, and it is so mind-boggling.
[00:36:17.444 --> 00:36:29.211]  You know, people think of discrimination as only, well, I'm white and I was discriminated by black people, or I'm black, I was discriminated by white people, or I'm Hispanic, I was discriminated against by black people or white people.
[00:36:29.291 --> 00:36:30.272]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:36:30.812 --> 00:36:36.316]  See, they distract you with all of that and obsess over it all day, and certainly some of that goes on.
[00:36:36.776 --> 00:36:43.340]  The main issue is, it's back in the news today, two years running, General Electric has paid zero taxes.
[00:36:44.542 --> 00:36:45.583]  And made giant profits.
[00:36:46.924 --> 00:36:47.545]  Google pays 2.4.
[00:36:47.825 --> 00:36:53.531]  I was seeing numbers of Berkshire Hathaway paying less than 5%.
[00:36:54.712 --> 00:37:06.283]  And then meanwhile, constantly in the news, I've got Bill Gates and Warren Buffett and Oprah Winfrey, who they admit, quote, have secret meetings to discuss how to reduce population.
[00:37:06.723 --> 00:37:08.044]  Source on that, Times of London.
[00:37:09.105 --> 00:37:13.909]  Lecturing that, oh, you know, telling their audience rich people don't pay enough tax.
[00:37:14.089 --> 00:37:19.093]  Raise taxes and the taxes they promote are on people making 125 grand a year.
[00:37:19.333 --> 00:37:20.334]  Folks, that isn't rich.
[00:37:20.994 --> 00:37:24.537]  The middle class is so important because that's the group that gets their hair done.
[00:37:24.857 --> 00:37:27.760]  That's the group that buys cars and clothes and goes to your hotel.
[00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:31.683]  That's the group that has a local business and sponsors your radio station.
[00:37:32.003 --> 00:37:32.984]  That's the group
[00:37:33.524 --> 00:37:36.706]  In the million-plus small businesses that still run everything.
[00:37:36.766 --> 00:37:38.207]  We're now a service economy.
[00:37:38.528 --> 00:37:40.029]  The middle class is always important.
[00:37:40.409 --> 00:37:43.371]  In a service economy, it's all we've got.
[00:37:45.172 --> 00:37:46.413]  It's all we've got.
[00:37:46.513 --> 00:37:50.376]  And now under Bush and under Obama, we've had the head of the Small Business League on.
[00:37:51.684 --> 00:37:59.009]  They are giving almost none of, under federal law, the federal contracts to small businesses, even though under law they're supposed to.
[00:37:59.269 --> 00:38:08.036]  And it turns out there's a secret blacklist where small companies, and I'm talking about companies worth a hundred million bucks, that's considered small, cannot get government contracts.
[00:38:10.595 --> 00:38:16.137]  I mean, if we're going to have this system, shouldn't American companies, shouldn't small businesses get it?
[00:38:16.497 --> 00:38:16.797]  No!
[00:38:16.877 --> 00:38:19.078]  The big mega offshore corporations get it.
[00:38:19.358 --> 00:38:21.519]  Because they set up the system.
[00:38:21.939 --> 00:38:23.119]  They don't pay taxes.
[00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:24.940]  They get the government contracts.
[00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:26.261]  It's corporate welfare.
[00:38:26.541 --> 00:38:27.921]  And that's what I want to see cut.
[00:38:28.401 --> 00:38:29.782]  That's what I want to see fixed.
[00:38:31.345 --> 00:38:40.231]  And you're not going to hear the stinking Republicans tell you about it, and you're not going to hear the stinking Democrats talk about it, because they're on the same team at the top.
[00:38:40.871 --> 00:38:43.013]  They're talking about cutting welfare.
[00:38:43.333 --> 00:38:44.253]  You know what's going to happen?
[00:38:44.513 --> 00:38:46.255]  Because we're already in this dependent mode.
[00:38:46.375 --> 00:38:46.975]  I was against it.
[00:38:47.295 --> 00:38:48.356]  I am still against it.
[00:38:48.616 --> 00:38:50.377]  You know what's going to happen if they kick the 49
[00:38:51.718 --> 00:38:52.659]  And a half million.
[00:38:53.699 --> 00:38:55.120]  Every few months it goes up by another million.
[00:38:56.021 --> 00:39:02.024]  Within a month it's going to be 50 million people on full-bore food stamps.
[00:39:02.584 --> 00:39:03.485]  The little credit cards.
[00:39:04.586 --> 00:39:06.447]  Administered by Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan.
[00:39:06.947 --> 00:39:08.708]  Oh yeah, they make money on that as well.
[00:39:10.609 --> 00:39:16.853]  You know what would happen if 50 million people didn't have their soup line, their high-tech 21st century soup line?
[00:39:18.171 --> 00:39:23.914]  The cities, every actuary study and government study have shown, will burn within five days.
[00:39:25.195 --> 00:39:26.536]  Which is exactly where they want us!
[00:39:26.916 --> 00:39:41.465]  Because now, if you don't give the bankers the trillions they want every month in quote, bailout, that are really robbery, they've gotten government to sign on to their too-big-to-fail, to their Ponzi scheme, that they made money on the front end with, now they make money on the back end with.
[00:39:42.225 --> 00:39:54.188]  They're going to pull the plug completely on the economy, and they threatened it in Europe, they threatened total depression and martial law just two weeks ago in Greece, they threatened it three years ago here, and now they're threatening it again if we don't do everything they say.
[00:39:54.548 --> 00:40:01.170]  So instead we just slowly collapse, instead of fully collapsing at once, which would be better because it would collapse them.
[00:40:03.052 --> 00:40:06.393]  So there's no easy way out on this, but it goes bad to worse.
[00:40:06.593 --> 00:40:08.514]  Now, what is Obama saying?
[00:40:08.774 --> 00:40:13.636]  He says, if you don't raise that debt ceiling, I may not be able to send your Social Security checks out.
[00:40:14.397 --> 00:40:17.278]  Which again, they sell as an entitlement, because they stole the money.
[00:40:17.858 --> 00:40:22.980]  If you put it in a guaranteed investment of 5%, you'd get on average double the money after 30 years of working.
[00:40:23.981 --> 00:40:26.762]  That money's been gone for 50 years it hadn't been in there.
[00:40:28.576 --> 00:40:30.598]  It was leveraged and spent before it ever went in.
[00:40:30.898 --> 00:40:41.509]  So now they're going to have all these people on fixed incomes who are going to do whatever the government says and are going to support us going deeper into banana republic debt because they got to get their social security check.
[00:40:42.745 --> 00:40:45.067]  And down the road, you're not going to get your Social Security check.
[00:40:45.128 --> 00:40:47.990]  Oh, you'll still get it in the mail, but it won't buy anything.
[00:40:48.211 --> 00:40:53.116]  Just like a Deutsche Mark in 1932 wouldn't buy anything.
[00:40:53.596 --> 00:40:55.558]  A million of them wouldn't buy a piece of bread.
[00:40:56.039 --> 00:40:58.421]  Ten million wouldn't buy a loaf by the end of it.
[00:40:59.042 --> 00:40:59.683]  They are
[00:41:01.411 --> 00:41:03.253]  Destroying the value of it.
[00:41:03.494 --> 00:41:05.997]  So you're already not getting your social security check.
[00:41:06.557 --> 00:41:15.649]  Everyone I know who has parents who are living on social security, 80, 85, 90 year old people I know that live at home.
[00:41:16.676 --> 00:41:31.541]  And if family wasn't giving them money, they'd be on the street, or they'd be in some government-run nursing home, which further bankrupts the society, because their Social Security will not pay for Jack Squat.
[00:41:31.881 --> 00:41:33.342]  And it's only begun!
[00:41:34.434 --> 00:41:35.994]  So they're always going to dangle that check.
[00:41:36.095 --> 00:41:40.076]  Oh, look, we've frozen for two years the COLA, the cost of living increase.
[00:41:40.736 --> 00:41:42.797]  There's no inflation because the government says so.
[00:41:42.837 --> 00:41:46.078]  We fixed the numbers and everything's fine.
[00:41:46.238 --> 00:41:49.639]  And by the way, the Libya war is not a war.
[00:41:49.699 --> 00:41:51.179]  And by the way, the president can do whatever he wants.
[00:41:51.239 --> 00:41:54.280]  And by the way, he's going to take your guns with executive orders, he's announced.
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:55.180]  But it's no big deal.
[00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:56.801]  Mitch McConnell says it's OK.
[00:42:00.427 --> 00:42:11.228]  And so they'll dangle these social security checks and the welfare and the Lone Star cards in front of you, but it's not going to matter.
[00:42:12.142 --> 00:42:14.784]  It's not going to matter because you're not going to be able to buy as much with it.
[00:42:15.144 --> 00:42:17.806]  You're already having the check basically cut in half.
[00:42:18.246 --> 00:42:29.133]  Let's go ahead and play a clip of Obama, Barry Sotero, basically engaging in financial terrorism, saying, hey, that's right, you don't go deeper into debt with the bankers, you won't get your money.
[00:42:29.393 --> 00:42:36.578]  Instead of saying, yeah, we can still pay our Social Security, we're writing off the thousand point five quadrillion that's impossible to pay.
[00:42:36.838 --> 00:42:39.920]  You could pay hundreds and hundreds of times all the wealth in the world.
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:40.621]  This is admitted.
[00:42:41.121 --> 00:42:42.242]  This is even in mainstream news.
[00:42:42.602 --> 00:42:44.283]  Into the derivatives and it wouldn't pay it off.
[00:42:44.784 --> 00:42:47.806]  You could pay... Jim Rogers talks about this.
[00:42:49.867 --> 00:42:50.868]  They all talk about it.
[00:42:52.009 --> 00:42:53.250]  John Williams talks about it.
[00:42:53.290 --> 00:42:54.170]  Top economist.
[00:42:54.471 --> 00:42:55.651]  You could pay everything in.
[00:42:55.731 --> 00:42:57.913]  Hundreds and hundreds of times it wouldn't pay it off.
[00:42:59.134 --> 00:43:00.995]  And notice they've bankrupted
[00:43:02.313 --> 00:43:12.338]  Spain, Portugal, Italy, all these countries, Greece, Ireland, and every time they have a quote, bailout, which is a, we're too big to fail, give us hundreds of billions or we'll implode everything.
[00:43:13.138 --> 00:43:14.539]  We won't loan your government more money.
[00:43:14.819 --> 00:43:16.300]  Well, you're even in more debt than our government.
[00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:16.980]  Doesn't matter.
[00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:17.821]  Loan us more money.
[00:43:18.001 --> 00:43:20.302]  Okay, you gave us the money, now we loan it back to you at interest.
[00:43:20.682 --> 00:43:22.023]  To the government and you individually.
[00:43:22.827 --> 00:43:25.429]  And then every time, just give us one more bailout and everything will be fixed.
[00:43:25.629 --> 00:43:26.389]  Okay, here's the bailout.
[00:43:26.609 --> 00:43:27.390]  Europe's even worse!
[00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:28.791]  Spiraling out of control, spreading everywhere!
[00:43:28.971 --> 00:43:30.172]  Give us even more money, we'll fix it!
[00:43:30.332 --> 00:43:30.992]  Okay, here's more!
[00:43:31.332 --> 00:43:32.373]  Oh my gosh, it's even worse!
[00:43:32.393 --> 00:43:33.014]  It's horrible!
[00:43:33.054 --> 00:43:33.594]  Give us even more!
[00:43:33.814 --> 00:43:34.755]  Okay, here's even more!
[00:43:35.255 --> 00:43:36.776]  Oh my gosh, everything's even more horrible!
[00:43:36.836 --> 00:43:37.556]  Everything's imploding!
[00:43:37.777 --> 00:43:38.317]  Oh my gosh!
[00:43:38.557 --> 00:43:40.358]  Now we need to take the private pension funds in Europe!
[00:43:40.538 --> 00:43:42.179]  Okay, here's part of my private pension fund!
[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:42.800]  Just fix it!
[00:43:43.806 --> 00:43:59.840]  Now in Europe, in Greece, in Ireland, they're openly moving to take your private pension fund that the governments of Europe made you for 50 years, put in to these private funds, and now they're saying, well, we're going to take part of that, but if we don't take part of it, the whole thing will be lost.
[00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:00.741]  Okay, here's part of it.
[00:44:01.365 --> 00:44:02.566]  Oh my gosh, things are even worse!
[00:44:02.586 --> 00:44:03.327]  We've got to take even more!
[00:44:03.667 --> 00:44:04.548]  Okay, take more.
[00:44:04.768 --> 00:44:06.149]  And pretty soon you have nothing.
[00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:10.293]  And through currency devaluation on top of the stealing, you end up with nothing.
[00:44:10.513 --> 00:44:14.016]  But they've played this incremental, rope-a-dope game with you.
[00:44:16.178 --> 00:44:17.780]  And yeah, I'm yelling and screaming, folks.
[00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:19.541]  I feel like I'm living in the Twilight Zone.
[00:44:19.641 --> 00:44:21.483]  I can't believe what's going on anymore.
[00:44:21.683 --> 00:44:22.464]  I can't believe.
[00:44:24.209 --> 00:44:32.134]  That the president is announcing he's going to sign an executive order and put you on a no-buy list with no criminal record and no proof and you can't get off the list.
[00:44:32.475 --> 00:44:35.857]  And they're just ordering gun shops now, outside of law, what to do.
[00:44:36.077 --> 00:44:39.279]  I mean, this is called, one word, DIC-TA-TOR-SHIP.
[00:44:39.319 --> 00:44:39.940]  Let me say it again.
[00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:41.141]  Dictatorship.
[00:44:41.421 --> 00:44:42.301]  Dictatorship.
[00:44:42.602 --> 00:44:43.482]  Dictatorship.
[00:44:43.762 --> 00:44:44.503]  Dictating.
[00:44:45.684 --> 00:44:46.544]  You know what a secretary does?
[00:44:46.564 --> 00:44:47.305]  She dictates.
[00:44:48.837 --> 00:44:51.079]  You dictate to her and she writes it.
[00:44:51.479 --> 00:44:52.259]  I dictate.
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:45:02.907]  The word dictate means when the emperor or the pharaoh would stand up and give law, it would be chiseled into stone and put out publicly.
[00:45:03.107 --> 00:45:05.108]  I am dictating to you.
[00:45:05.129 --> 00:45:07.230]  I am your dictator.
[00:45:09.412 --> 00:45:10.792]  You are taking dictation.
[00:45:10.893 --> 00:45:12.614]  You are doing what the dictator says.
[00:45:13.214 --> 00:45:14.375]  I'm your boss secretary.
[00:45:14.755 --> 00:45:15.516]  Type this out.
[00:45:17.634 --> 00:45:18.735]  I'm your boss, America!
[00:45:18.795 --> 00:45:19.295]  Do what I say!
[00:45:19.475 --> 00:45:22.017]  Obama said two days ago, eat your peas, like you're a little kid.
[00:45:22.177 --> 00:45:26.300]  They always talk to us in this fatherly way, like they're our boss, they're our owner.
[00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:28.042]  If you notice, everything's childlike.
[00:45:28.102 --> 00:45:32.125]  We're the children, the states are loving mommy and daddy, and the police are our big brother.
[00:45:32.625 --> 00:45:38.309]  Well, let me tell you something, police and everybody else, they're stealing your dollar value, they're gonna take your pension funds, too.
[00:45:38.349 --> 00:45:39.390]  We're all in this together.
[00:45:40.450 --> 00:45:43.132]  And if you keep buying into their false narrative, we have no future.
[00:45:43.393 --> 00:45:46.395]  Now, here is the clip of Obama
[00:45:47.737 --> 00:45:55.062]  And the Obamanoids holding old people hostage know in full well they're going to steal every bit of their paycheck in the end through inflation.
[00:45:55.102 --> 00:45:55.482]  Here it is.
[00:45:56.643 --> 00:46:00.265]  Can you tell the folks at home that no matter what happens
[00:46:02.585 --> 00:46:05.147]  All right, sometimes the computers, that's why we're going to replace them.
[00:46:05.187 --> 00:46:05.708]  Play them slow.
[00:46:05.728 --> 00:46:07.089]  We are going to replace those computers.
[00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:08.991]  We're going to try to play this.
[00:46:09.471 --> 00:46:11.373]  There's got to be better computers than this.
[00:46:11.493 --> 00:46:12.154]  It's got to happen.
[00:46:13.755 --> 00:46:14.716]  We're ready with the clip now.
[00:46:14.756 --> 00:46:15.137]  Here it is.
[00:46:15.777 --> 00:46:21.503]  Can you tell the folks at home that no matter what happens, the Social Security checks are going to go out on August the 3rd?
[00:46:21.903 --> 00:46:26.608]  They're about $20 billion worth of Social Security checks that have to go out the day after
[00:46:27.228 --> 00:46:29.189]  The government is supposedly going to go into default.
[00:46:29.309 --> 00:46:31.590]  Well, this is not just a matter of social security checks.
[00:46:31.630 --> 00:46:32.590]  These are veterans checks.
[00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:36.051]  These are folks on disability and their checks.
[00:46:37.452 --> 00:46:40.073]  There are about 70 million checks that go out.
[00:46:40.273 --> 00:46:43.094]  Can you guarantee as president those checks will go out on August the 3rd?
[00:46:44.378 --> 00:46:49.121]  I cannot guarantee that those checks go out on August 3rd if we haven't resolved this issue.
[00:46:49.701 --> 00:46:54.363]  Because there may simply not be the money in the coffers to do it.
[00:46:54.844 --> 00:46:57.045]  Alright, that's CBS propaganda news.
[00:46:57.185 --> 00:47:02.628]  Now, let's go over this here briefly.
[00:47:04.129 --> 00:47:11.753]  We got just shy of 50 million, 49 plus million people and growing, on food stamps.
[00:47:13.144 --> 00:47:18.130]  There's another 40 million or so on some other form of assistance, so that's 90 million.
[00:47:18.851 --> 00:47:20.192]  Let's be conservative, 80 million.
[00:47:20.813 --> 00:47:24.577]  You've got 70 million people on Social Security, so what's 70 million and 70 million?
[00:47:24.617 --> 00:47:25.118]  That's 140 million.
[00:47:30.856 --> 00:47:33.397]  So that's close to half the population of the country.
[00:47:33.678 --> 00:47:39.001]  There's 310 million people here, and another 30 million illegal aliens, most of them on welfare, on top of their paychecks.
[00:47:39.021 --> 00:47:39.861]  That's the big dirty secret.
[00:47:40.502 --> 00:47:48.286]  So we got 330 million people here, and we got 140 million of them openly on government assistance.
[00:47:49.467 --> 00:47:49.767]  Okay?
[00:47:50.167 --> 00:47:51.508]  You're like, well I pay for that social security.
[00:47:51.608 --> 00:47:53.169]  Regardless, you're dependent on government.
[00:47:53.843 --> 00:48:02.827]  Okay, which is run by foreign ruthless banks that have imploded countries hundreds of times in the last century and are experts on how to socially engineer this and how to control everything.
[00:48:03.107 --> 00:48:04.267]  They put the police state in place.
[00:48:04.548 --> 00:48:05.328]  It isn't for Al Qaeda.
[00:48:05.348 --> 00:48:06.268]  Let me give you a newsflash.
[00:48:06.648 --> 00:48:07.729]  We got their own training manuals.
[00:48:07.789 --> 00:48:08.269]  It's for you.
[00:48:08.969 --> 00:48:13.671]  So then you've got of the Fortune 500, most of them dependent on government contracts.
[00:48:14.912 --> 00:48:19.334]  And you've got individuals on government contracts or private companies that are on government contracts.
[00:48:19.654 --> 00:48:20.494]  I mean, do the math.
[00:48:20.514 --> 00:48:21.995]  140 million on some type of welfare.
[00:48:23.622 --> 00:48:28.304]  That leaves 160, 170 million people that aren't.
[00:48:28.704 --> 00:48:31.105]  Most of them, in some form, are on a government contract.
[00:48:31.766 --> 00:48:41.370]  I've seen some numbers that it's as low as 50 million people in this country who aren't on some type of government dole, or who aren't dependent on government.
[00:48:41.650 --> 00:48:44.011]  And remember, out of those 50 million, a lot of them are children.
[00:48:45.292 --> 00:48:49.033]  I mean, this country is so... Well, they got a word for it.
[00:48:51.114 --> 00:48:51.715]  We are living in a
[00:48:53.052 --> 00:49:02.339]  World to hurt, and we've been maneuvered into this position, and now they're going to hold us hostage every year or two with another bailout, with higher taxes, with more austerity.
[00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:06.843]  And the more they cut services, the more they increase the water price, the more they cut cops.
[00:49:08.224 --> 00:49:18.432]  I've seen cases where they fire 60 plus percent of the sheriff's deputies, and the sheriff says, I'm sorry, the county has told us to just be revenue generators now to pay our own checks.
[00:49:18.792 --> 00:49:20.854]  We're not going to respond to crime by guns.
[00:49:22.315 --> 00:49:26.701]  Here's 35 crimes we're not going to respond to, including home invasion, by guns.
[00:49:27.422 --> 00:49:29.665]  And at least those sheriffs and police chiefs have been honest.
[00:49:30.647 --> 00:49:39.379]  You look at Chicago and crime havens like that, they say you can't own a gun, but by the way, we're not going to respond to crime.
[00:49:43.697 --> 00:49:45.838]  Do you realize how hardcore this is?
[00:49:46.239 --> 00:49:47.259]  We're in a depression.
[00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:52.183]  Now, Geithner, the head of the Treasury, calls it on Meet the Press, what did he call it?
[00:49:52.563 --> 00:49:53.583]  The Great Recession.
[00:49:54.944 --> 00:50:01.168]  But wait a minute, they told us the recession ended in March, no, no, in June of 2009, so two years ago.
[00:50:01.689 --> 00:50:02.129]  It ended!
[00:50:02.189 --> 00:50:12.056]  I mean, there was... Oh, but now he said it's going to be the most painful thing that many of us have ever seen, and it's going to go on for a long time.
[00:50:12.076 --> 00:50:12.296]  Remember?
[00:50:13.203 --> 00:50:13.824]  That's the quote.
[00:50:14.345 --> 00:50:15.146]  I played it yesterday.
[00:50:15.706 --> 00:50:16.688]  Can we queue up, Geithner?
[00:50:17.068 --> 00:50:19.592]  I'm going to play that exact quote when we come back.
[00:50:20.453 --> 00:50:20.793]  Thank you.
[00:50:22.155 --> 00:50:26.862]  So this is the reality of what we're facing.
[00:50:28.172 --> 00:50:30.093]  And, you know, I'm the extremist.
[00:50:30.893 --> 00:50:41.978]  Fifteen years ago, I had medical doctors on, reading studies that were from a decade before that, that they knew cell phones and rat studies were causing big fat brain tumors and lowering fertility.
[00:50:42.518 --> 00:50:45.659]  And here is a whole bunch of mainline university studies.
[00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:48.621]  Cell phones, cancer and infertility.
[00:50:49.401 --> 00:50:59.349]  Studies in the US, Europe, Australia all find doubling of brain tumors, doubling, and massive destruction of DNA and sperm.
[00:51:00.170 --> 00:51:00.691]  But so what?
[00:51:01.499 --> 00:51:07.624]  Hey, Brian, if you could do just one thing today to ensure your family's food security, what would it be?
[00:51:07.885 --> 00:51:08.705]  That's easy, Bill.
[00:51:08.885 --> 00:51:12.749]  I'd head straight to SoupBeanSurvival.com.
[00:51:13.029 --> 00:51:14.230]  SoupBeanSurvival.com?
[00:51:14.550 --> 00:51:24.479]  I know, Bill, it sounds crazy, but this ancient secret has been around for over 8,000 years, and it truly is nature's super survival food.
[00:51:24.679 --> 00:51:27.181]  Really, Brian, the number one survival food?
[00:51:27.301 --> 00:51:29.202]  Well, certainly the forgotten survival food.
[00:51:29.443 --> 00:51:30.303]  Absolutely, Bill.
[00:51:30.463 --> 00:51:41.811]  The folks at soupbeansurvival.com scoured our planet to find the very best heirloom seeds to truly find nature's super survival food.
[00:51:41.872 --> 00:51:43.773]  Brian, these aren't grocery store beans, are they?
[00:51:44.133 --> 00:51:44.834]  No way, Bill.
[00:51:44.874 --> 00:51:47.395]  You're not going to find these beans in any grocery store.
[00:51:47.555 --> 00:51:50.917]  These are the absolute highest quality beans in the world.
[00:51:50.997 --> 00:51:53.379]  Visit soupbeansurvival.com.
[00:51:53.679 --> 00:52:00.743]  That's soupbeansurvival.com for all the information you're going to need for nature's super survival food.
[00:52:00.903 --> 00:52:05.125]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:52:05.446 --> 00:52:06.026]  Number one.
[00:52:06.346 --> 00:52:10.329]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:52:10.629 --> 00:52:15.193]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:52:15.513 --> 00:52:15.973]  It's true.
[00:52:16.253 --> 00:52:21.677]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:52:21.958 --> 00:52:25.240]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:29.243]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:52:29.443 --> 00:52:30.003]  Number 4.
[00:52:30.244 --> 00:52:32.605]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:52:33.006 --> 00:52:36.388]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:52:36.689 --> 00:52:37.229]  Number 5.

[00:52:41.632 --> 00:52:46.396]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:53:30.226 --> 00:53:31.287]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:53:31.467 --> 00:53:35.850]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:41.734]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:53:41.834 --> 00:53:45.256]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:53:45.476 --> 00:53:48.078]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:53:48.198 --> 00:53:53.121]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[00:53:53.261 --> 00:53:53.482]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:53:53.502 --> 00:53:54.903]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:54:16.097 --> 00:54:21.300]  By the way, this happened a couple days ago and I kept waiting to see the national media cover it, but they didn't.
[00:54:22.221 --> 00:54:27.224]  Ron Paul, in the key battleground state of New Hampshire, in a straw poll, garnered 39%
[00:54:30.352 --> 00:54:35.394]  of the vote, absolutely trouncing all other competition.
[00:54:36.274 --> 00:54:49.899]  Rick Santorum got 12%, Michelle Bachmann even less with 11%, Romney got 9%, but it doesn't matter, the establishment is going to force feed us Romney and Michelle Bachmann, the former IRS tax collector.
[00:54:52.173 --> 00:55:03.328]  Continuing here, this is a clip again of Geithner saying this is going to be for many Americans the toughest time in their life and it's going to go on for a long time.
[00:55:03.368 --> 00:55:04.870]  Here's the clip from Meet the Press.
[00:55:05.984 --> 00:55:07.665]  Well, I think it's going to take a long time still.
[00:55:07.685 --> 00:55:08.766]  This is a very tough economy.
[00:55:08.906 --> 00:55:15.469]  And I think for a lot of people, it's going to feel very hard, harder than anything they've experienced in a lifetime now for some time to come.
[00:55:15.810 --> 00:55:26.956]  But that is because that is the tragic effects of a crisis this deep and this bad caused by a long period of lost opportunities to do things to make the country stronger.
[00:55:27.056 --> 00:55:27.816]  All right, let's stop there.
[00:55:27.836 --> 00:55:38.839]  I mean, these are the guys that got rid of Glass-Steagall, that created the derivatives, that signed us onto it, that authored all of this, and they're telling us that it's because we haven't done everything they've told us to do that we're going to have this problem.
[00:55:39.459 --> 00:55:45.361]  And the head of General Electric, who heads up the White House Economic Council, is saying, we need to get regulations off businesses.
[00:55:45.641 --> 00:55:51.563]  He's the guy in there recommending the regulations to shut down his competition, but then he gives speeches about getting rid of regulations.
[00:55:52.423 --> 00:55:53.783]  They say zig, they zag.
[00:55:54.003 --> 00:55:55.124]  They say black, it's white.
[00:55:55.144 --> 00:55:56.084]  They say up, it's down.
[00:55:56.744 --> 00:55:59.545]  They say the sky is red, you know it's blue.
[00:56:00.206 --> 00:56:03.868]  They say they didn't ship those guns into Mexico, you know you did it, they've been caught lying again.
[00:56:04.308 --> 00:56:05.128]  These are crooks!
[00:56:05.768 --> 00:56:06.569]  Time to grow up!
[00:56:07.619 --> 00:56:08.420]  We're in their clutches.
[00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:13.224]  I want to bring Ted Anderson up for this segment, the next little short one, then we've got a big guest coming up in the next hour.
[00:56:13.524 --> 00:56:17.167]  Ted, the owner of the Genesis Network that I've been on for more than 14 years now.
[00:56:17.848 --> 00:56:25.754]  Ted Anderson, of course, also the owner of Midas Resources, now what, the fifth or is it the fourth now largest gold and silver company in the nation?
[00:56:26.535 --> 00:56:27.856]  That's a great free market story.
[00:56:27.916 --> 00:56:32.180]  He buys gold and silver when it's low, sells it to you when it's high at the old low price.
[00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:34.622]  Gold now at an all-time global high.
[00:56:35.083 --> 00:56:38.506]  Right up there at, what, 1,590 smackers.
[00:56:38.987 --> 00:56:42.010]  Silver surging in the middle of the summer, normally a doldrum.
[00:56:42.270 --> 00:56:43.531]  Can you imagine the fall?
[00:56:43.551 --> 00:56:47.716]  If that sounds high now, folks, there's global devaluation of all currencies.
[00:56:48.016 --> 00:56:50.459]  The laws of economics say it will only go up.
[00:56:50.919 --> 00:56:53.121]  They can play games and drive it down for a period.
[00:56:53.461 --> 00:56:54.862]  That's when you should get in and buy it.
[00:56:55.222 --> 00:57:03.548]  But since you didn't listen, you can now get in a time machine with Ted Anderson and go back and get gold and silver he bought months ago during the dip, even though it's now high.
[00:57:03.808 --> 00:57:04.548]  You can't beat that.
[00:57:04.808 --> 00:57:06.950]  Ted Anderson, what do you make of gold at an all-time high?
[00:57:07.390 --> 00:57:15.317]  Well, it's very surprising to see it here in July, but I guess not when you look at the economy and what's going on in Europe and here in the United States.
[00:57:15.377 --> 00:57:17.599]  I mean, you're playing Ben Bernanke's thing.
[00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:23.465]  I was looking at Reuters and his comments, and it's just amazing, talking about QE3 now.
[00:57:23.485 --> 00:57:26.588]  Yeah, they said they wouldn't do QE3, so you know they will.
[00:57:28.101 --> 00:57:33.104]  And now he's gone back on that as well, which means further dollar devaluation, total hyperinflation.
[00:57:33.344 --> 00:57:36.226]  Ted, you've got a whole list of gold and silver that you bought months ago.
[00:57:36.806 --> 00:57:37.866]  It's radio specials.
[00:57:37.906 --> 00:57:40.588]  Folks should say Alex Jones Radio Specials when they call.
[00:57:40.628 --> 00:57:44.190]  I want to talk a little bit more about this on the other side, but the number to call, folks, is 800-686-2237.
[00:57:44.210 --> 00:57:44.350]  800-686-2237.
[00:57:44.430 --> 00:57:49.472]  And I just want to add, Ted, you've got the American Dream animated film that's top-notch.
[00:57:55.165 --> 00:57:55.485]  I don't
[00:58:15.908 --> 00:58:18.530]  And he wants you to get this film out to everybody and the book.
[00:58:18.810 --> 00:58:20.351]  Read it yourself and pay it forward.
[00:58:20.371 --> 00:58:21.232]  800-686-2237.
[00:58:22.533 --> 00:58:29.197]  They'll read you a list of the gold and silver coins that will take you back in time months ago.
[00:58:29.437 --> 00:58:32.820]  But Ted is in danger of running out of that and his prices will go up.
[00:58:33.060 --> 00:58:36.062]  We'll briefly tell you some of those smoking prices on the other side.
[00:58:36.302 --> 00:58:38.283]  Then we'll get into where Ted sees the markets going.
[00:58:38.483 --> 00:58:39.864]  Then we've got a guest joining us.
[00:58:39.884 --> 00:58:40.445]  You don't want to miss it.
[00:58:45.131 --> 00:58:49.014]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:52.637 --> 00:58:56.280]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:58:56.660 --> 00:58:59.663]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:58:59.903 --> 00:59:04.707]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:59:04.727 --> 00:59:10.952]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:59:11.092 --> 00:59:13.334]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:59:13.854 --> 00:59:14.134]  Tim Geithner?
[00:59:14.174 --> 00:59:14.594]  Bernanke?
[00:59:14.675 --> 00:59:15.295]  They're arsonists!
[00:59:15.355 --> 00:59:16.616]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:59:16.636 --> 00:59:18.877]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:59:32.765 --> 00:59:34.606]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:59:34.886 --> 00:59:39.708]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:59:40.048 --> 00:59:49.993]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:59:54.295 --> 00:59:56.235]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.676 --> 00:59:59.437]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:06.004 --> 01:00:10.190]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.831 --> 01:00:11.652]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.433 --> 01:00:13.354]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.975 --> 01:00:17.600]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.161 --> 01:00:22.226]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.342 --> 01:00:30.506]  We've got anti-terror specialist researcher Tony Farrell.
[01:00:31.266 --> 01:00:34.949]  Served in Britain's South Yorkshire Police for 12 years as police intelligence analyst.
[01:00:35.669 --> 01:00:39.652]  It was Farrell's job to produce annual strategic threat assessment matrix reports.
[01:00:40.432 --> 01:00:44.235]  And he discovered that the evidence pointed towards government-sponsored terror and was let go.
[01:00:44.255 --> 01:00:48.258]  He'll be joining us coming up in light of the bombshell, Saudis and U.S.
[01:00:48.278 --> 01:00:49.559]  government-protected hijackers.
[01:00:50.259 --> 01:00:51.080]  That's coming up.
[01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:55.843]  And we have some also special guests in studio, great activists take calls then as well.
[01:00:55.884 --> 01:00:57.645]  Got a lot of news I haven't gotten to yet.
[01:00:57.665 --> 01:00:59.186]  But going back to Ted Anderson.
[01:00:59.226 --> 01:01:02.669]  So, so Ted, gold now at an all-time high.
[01:01:02.689 --> 01:01:05.211]  We're going right up to $1,590 smackers.
[01:01:05.231 --> 01:01:06.032]  Silver surging as well today.
[01:01:10.735 --> 01:01:12.215]  Right up close to 39.
[01:01:12.875 --> 01:01:20.337]  This is amazing, but really it isn't amazing when you understand that this is what happens when you have dollar devaluation.
[01:01:21.597 --> 01:01:29.639]  I mean we have seen way too much printing of currency and it's competing with the money that's out there and it's just pushing the value of gold and silver up.
[01:01:29.679 --> 01:01:34.780]  And it's not just happening here in the United States, it's happening in Europe and it's happening all over the place.
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:39.541]  I was watching the Asian markets this morning long before the US market opened
[01:01:39.941 --> 01:02:01.434]  and that was going up all night long and here we are sitting here today watching the market doing the into the same thing in new york obviously the word is out there and the united states is the dollars in trouble we printed way too much currency you're talking about items that i have uh... you know i mean that the eagle right now is sitting at sixteen ninety eight ninety two i have
[01:02:02.154 --> 01:02:15.341]  Uh, you know, the Palladium bars, I have Mexican pesos, I have one-ounce Maple Leafs, I have Coronas, I have Platinum Eagles, I have Australian Nugget gold coins, I've got quarter-ounce Krugerrands, you know, quarter-ounce silver bars.
[01:02:15.641 --> 01:02:18.982]  We have just a whole long line of various different things.
[01:02:19.362 --> 01:02:24.125]  You know, the premiums have gone up so far on the bullion coins that I even...
[01:02:24.605 --> 01:02:24.985]  I think so.
[01:02:55.645 --> 01:02:56.346]  Absolutely.
[01:02:56.426 --> 01:03:03.088]  So there's a long list of things that are on the sheet that are the special 800-686-2237.
[01:03:03.108 --> 01:03:04.389]  800-686-2237.
[01:03:06.230 --> 01:03:17.994]  I'll go back, folks, to telling you to buy silver when it was $5 an ounce 10 years ago, telling you to buy gold when it was $360 an ounce, and then every time they play the game, make it dip by $100 on gold or $10 on silver.
[01:03:20.055 --> 01:03:21.336]  People say, are you going to sell yours?
[01:03:21.416 --> 01:03:21.956]  No, I'm not.
[01:03:22.216 --> 01:03:25.898]  I'm going to buy more because they're globally devaluing currencies.
[01:03:26.299 --> 01:03:29.500]  Gold and silver is denominated in those currencies.
[01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:31.301]  The gold and silver isn't going up.
[01:03:32.122 --> 01:03:34.063]  The currencies are going down.
[01:03:34.083 --> 01:03:38.685]  And so what you're doing is dodging inflation with these moves.
[01:03:39.426 --> 01:03:47.070]  You would have had a fourfold increase if you bought gold 10 years ago, a sevenfold increase in silver when it was up at 50, right at 50, tenfold.
[01:03:50.037 --> 01:03:53.638]  The point is, it is now time to get involved in gold and silver.
[01:03:54.058 --> 01:03:57.900]  Ted, I know that the stuff you've got is from, what, about a month, month and a half ago?
[01:03:58.220 --> 01:04:01.581]  How long are you going to be able to have these specials you've got right now before prices go up?
[01:04:02.341 --> 01:04:04.302]  Alex, I know that today is going to be a hot day.
[01:04:04.342 --> 01:04:07.203]  It could be over by the day's end, just due to the fact that, you know,
[01:04:09.895 --> 01:04:11.297]  The prices are going up like they are.
[01:04:11.317 --> 01:04:12.619]  People are going to be calling and buying.
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:14.322]  I hope to carry it through further.
[01:04:14.582 --> 01:04:15.263]  We'll have to see.
[01:04:15.283 --> 01:04:17.928]  All right.
[01:04:17.948 --> 01:04:18.508]  800-686-2237.
[01:04:18.849 --> 01:04:22.695]  And how much is it to get the American Dream film along with the Big Brother book?
[01:04:22.715 --> 01:04:24.478]  You get the two silver dollars and you get those free.
[01:04:24.518 --> 01:04:25.019]  How much is that?
[01:04:25.399 --> 01:04:28.242]  Well, I'm still holding that at $75 delivered.
[01:04:28.282 --> 01:04:30.785]  I can tell you right now, you can't buy two silver dollars at $75.
[01:04:30.825 --> 01:04:34.930]  So that is a... So it's free delivery, the free film, and the free book.
[01:04:34.950 --> 01:04:36.752]  This is a big loss leader, folks.
[01:04:37.053 --> 01:04:38.754]  This is to get you introduced to the silver and gold.
[01:04:38.775 --> 01:04:41.558]  Ted does these specials only on this radio transmission.
[01:04:42.158 --> 01:04:44.882]  And I can't tell you, that's the best deal you'll find anywhere.
[01:04:45.722 --> 01:04:48.845]  I certify it, but your common sense certifies it.
[01:04:48.865 --> 01:04:50.666]  800-686-2237.
[01:04:50.987 --> 01:04:55.410]  I feel really good and sleep really good at night being able to offer you deals like that.
[01:04:56.631 --> 01:04:58.313]  So, please take advantage of it.
[01:04:58.333 --> 01:04:58.413]  800-686-237.
[01:04:58.453 --> 01:04:58.733]  Thank you, Tim.
[01:05:03.151 --> 01:05:06.792]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:07.112 --> 01:05:15.234]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:05:15.974 --> 01:05:20.015]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.

[01:06:01.155 --> 01:06:02.296]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:06:02.336 --> 01:06:08.999]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:06:09.279 --> 01:06:11.560]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:06:11.821 --> 01:06:17.023]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:06:17.203 --> 01:06:19.985]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:06:20.245 --> 01:06:22.306]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:06:22.546 --> 01:06:28.490]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:06:28.811 --> 01:06:32.013]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:06:32.193 --> 01:06:37.717]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:06:37.957 --> 01:06:39.278]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:06:39.618 --> 01:06:40.779]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:06:40.919 --> 01:06:43.461]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:06:43.581 --> 01:06:47.644]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.

[01:07:01.535 --> 01:07:03.036]  Hello, this is Steve Shank.
[01:07:03.196 --> 01:07:04.617]  What does freedom mean to you?
[01:07:05.538 --> 01:07:09.201]  The E-Foods Direct is celebrating freedom with the Freedom Food Giveaway.
[01:07:09.361 --> 01:07:13.224]  Each week in July, they are giving away a one-year food supply.
[01:07:13.424 --> 01:07:21.711]  Just go to efoodsdirect.com slash Alex and register to win a one-year food supply with a 25-year shelf life.
[01:07:21.971 --> 01:07:27.035]  At efoodsdirect.com slash Alex, look for the new Patriot Pack, a $149 12-day supply of food.
[01:07:29.537 --> 01:07:29.997]  We're good.
[01:07:46.084 --> 01:07:49.206]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:49.226 --> 01:07:50.647]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:20.791 --> 01:08:28.036]  Okay, I want to preface before we go to our guest here with just some basic history.
[01:08:28.116 --> 01:08:38.443]  In mainline Roman history, and you learn that Julius Caesar's family actually got political power through this over several generations, fire departments were set up in the big city of Rome.
[01:08:39.244 --> 01:08:46.408]  And if your neighborhood did not pay them the fire department fee, they would set fires and burn down your neighborhood.
[01:08:47.889 --> 01:08:49.871]  And over time, it grew into a protection racket.
[01:08:51.158 --> 01:09:12.227]  The Sicilian Mafia in the last 200 years in Italy and the United States, in places like New York and Boston and other places, didn't invent coming to your grocery store or your laundry or your restaurant or your church and saying you need to pay us protection money or somebody's going to burn down your grocery store.
[01:09:12.647 --> 01:09:14.108]  I'm not saying who's going to do it.
[01:09:14.688 --> 01:09:22.700]  But if you pay me a little protection money and hire my cousin, he'll watch out and make sure nobody burns down your grocery store.
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:27.547]  And of course, it's the cousin smiling at you from behind the capo that's going to burn down your grocery store.
[01:09:28.749 --> 01:09:37.512]  There was a case of this in New York, I don't know, it was a decade ago, got a lot of attention, so I use it as an example, where somebody with ball-peen hammers knocked out hundreds of car windows for years.
[01:09:38.093 --> 01:09:46.096]  And folks noticed that there were billboards everywhere for a company that had shops all over the areas that would fix your windshield for the lowest price.
[01:09:46.756 --> 01:09:56.480]  And finally, it was discovered by one of the workers with a whistle that he had upwards of eight people going out every night knocking dings and windshields with a ball-peen hammer.
[01:09:57.150 --> 01:09:58.411]  Now, that's a false flag.
[01:09:58.551 --> 01:09:59.291]  Business attack.
[01:10:00.672 --> 01:10:06.674]  There's been a lot of evidence that major virus companies are hiring hackers to release viruses that they then already have the fix to.
[01:10:07.775 --> 01:10:09.896]  I mean, this really is common sense.
[01:10:09.976 --> 01:10:17.359]  Governments in the West the last hundred years have made drugs illegal because the big powerful interests control the drugs being brought in.
[01:10:18.019 --> 01:10:24.242]  Now they can shut down their competition with the law they've bought off and they can make larger profits because it's now a black market item.
[01:10:25.592 --> 01:10:28.294]  This is all really just cause and effect, common sense.
[01:10:28.674 --> 01:10:32.638]  Hitler firebombing his own Reichstag, that's now been released and confirmed.
[01:10:32.898 --> 01:10:42.025]  Hitler blowing up his own military base, blaming it on the Poles to attack Poland and say, oh look, the Poles attacked our base, our communications base.
[01:10:42.425 --> 01:10:47.749]  They even dressed up prisoners and shot them in Polish uniforms and German uniforms to show newsreels of dead bodies.
[01:10:48.030 --> 01:10:49.211]  That's how World War II started.
[01:10:49.451 --> 01:10:50.652]  That's publicly admitted.
[01:10:51.696 --> 01:10:53.337]  So, the point is, you know governments do this.
[01:10:53.377 --> 01:10:56.678]  You know Gulf of Tonkin was staged to get us into Vietnam saying our ships were attacked.
[01:10:57.318 --> 01:11:02.640]  They said it was a conspiracy theory for 40 years, from the 40th anniversary, the CIA declassified, they staged it.
[01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:06.281]  We already knew because officers on the ships came back.
[01:11:08.035 --> 01:11:09.756]  And reported, no, we weren't attacked.
[01:11:10.076 --> 01:11:11.597]  That was in the San Diego paper back in 64.
[01:11:11.737 --> 01:11:15.019]  But it becomes a rumor, a legend.
[01:11:15.059 --> 01:11:16.599]  People heard it was staged.
[01:11:16.639 --> 01:11:18.040]  Well, later it came out it was staged.
[01:11:19.101 --> 01:11:21.562]  And there's Operation Gladio, over 200 U.S.
[01:11:21.782 --> 01:11:23.743]  bombings carried out with NATO in Europe.
[01:11:24.083 --> 01:11:27.224]  Their favorite thing was to blow up school buses, because that really got folks upset.
[01:11:27.665 --> 01:11:32.747]  And they would grab a patsy, shoot him in the head, and say that, you know, they had committed the bombing of the school bus.
[01:11:32.787 --> 01:11:34.428]  So it's time to grow up.
[01:11:34.568 --> 01:11:36.989]  The Russians do it, the Tsars did it before the Communists.
[01:11:38.629 --> 01:11:39.950]  Every major government does this.
[01:11:40.150 --> 01:11:43.451]  And the argument of the Pentagon is, others are doing it, we gotta do it.
[01:11:43.951 --> 01:11:56.175]  You got Operation Northwoods, where the Pentagon proposed to Kennedy to blow up D.C., bomb Miami, hijack jets by remote control, crash them, blame it on the Russians, start World War III.
[01:11:56.495 --> 01:11:59.135]  Kennedy said no, and they said, well, then we're gonna just take you out.
[01:12:02.196 --> 01:12:03.296]  All of that goes on.
[01:12:03.516 --> 01:12:04.556]  All of that is happening.
[01:12:04.897 --> 01:12:10.818]  And, you know, I've talked a lot about this because it was in Newsweek, it was in major newspapers that the hijackers were trained at U.S.
[01:12:10.878 --> 01:12:11.258]  bases.
[01:12:11.798 --> 01:12:14.278]  And it came out, but was never discussed again.
[01:12:14.318 --> 01:12:19.299]  And the head of the Defense Language School, Colonel Butler, went public and said, some of these guys were at our school.
[01:12:19.939 --> 01:12:20.740]  I recognize them.
[01:12:20.780 --> 01:12:21.640]  Something's going on.
[01:12:21.860 --> 01:12:22.880]  The government's behind this.
[01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:25.441]  And then they started a court-martial against him, and he shut up.
[01:12:25.781 --> 01:12:26.821]  And they dropped the court-martial.
[01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:36.505]  All of that said, I wanted to play this clip before we go to our guest from England for the rest of the hour, and we appreciate his courage in going public and losing his job over this.
[01:12:37.386 --> 01:12:39.708]  And I actually have some of the local papers that reported on it here.
[01:12:39.768 --> 01:12:42.149]  But bombshells, Saudi and U.S.
[01:12:42.189 --> 01:12:43.890]  government protected hijackers.
[01:12:45.091 --> 01:12:46.792]  And of course, I mean, who set up al-Qaeda?
[01:12:47.112 --> 01:12:51.295]  Saudi Arabia, the U.S., England, and Israel, along with Pakistan intelligence, in 1979.
[01:12:51.335 --> 01:12:55.218]  Zbigniew Brzezinski has written two books in the last five years bragging about it.
[01:12:56.657 --> 01:12:58.801]  And it's the same groups working together.
[01:12:58.841 --> 01:13:03.608]  We've had Mr. Springman, the former head of the visa section of the embassy on, where they were ordered.
[01:13:03.668 --> 01:13:04.810]  It's been in the Toronto Star.
[01:13:04.830 --> 01:13:07.614]  I had him on nine years ago, but I've had him on since.
[01:13:09.178 --> 01:13:11.219]  Mr. Springman talked to his colleagues.
[01:13:11.279 --> 01:13:15.422]  They were ordered to let Mohammed Adda and others back into the U.S.
[01:13:15.942 --> 01:13:20.885]  what, eight months before 9-11, even though they were flagged as terrorists in their database.
[01:13:21.025 --> 01:13:25.548]  And the CIA, when they wouldn't let them in, had the State Department call and say, look, they work for us.
[01:13:25.588 --> 01:13:26.088]  That's a cover.
[01:13:27.281 --> 01:13:28.102]  The underwear bomber.
[01:13:28.562 --> 01:13:33.825]  Undersecretary of State Kennedy admits they were ordered to help get him on the plane by an unnamed U.S.
[01:13:33.885 --> 01:13:35.326]  agency and to give them the visa.
[01:13:35.847 --> 01:13:48.275]  We knew it a month and a half before because our listeners, lawyers, the Haskells, husband and wife lawyers, were on and saw the guy being got on the plane, thought it was suspicious, didn't have his passport, saw the whole firecracker deal, right as they roll out.
[01:13:48.315 --> 01:13:49.336]  I mean, it's all staged.
[01:13:50.186 --> 01:13:55.668]  Now, Fast and Furious, shipping guns in to the drug dealers to then blame it on the Second Amendment.
[01:13:55.948 --> 01:13:58.349]  Now they've announced the gun control because of their own operation.
[01:13:58.890 --> 01:13:59.410]  It's happening.
[01:14:00.210 --> 01:14:01.611]  I mean, they know what they're doing.
[01:14:02.091 --> 01:14:05.452]  And so it's time to grow up and realize this is happening.
[01:14:06.473 --> 01:14:09.454]  Now, here is a former governor of Florida.
[01:14:10.763 --> 01:14:17.388]  Former Senator and floor governor Bob Graham said at least two of the purported 9-11 hijackers had assistance from Saudi Arabia.
[01:14:17.448 --> 01:14:21.652]  Graham's recently released novel, Keys to the Kingdom, implicates the Saudis.
[01:14:21.672 --> 01:14:25.655]  He told MSNBC the novel is based on factual information.
[01:14:25.935 --> 01:14:27.737]  Let's go ahead and play that clip from MSNBC.
[01:14:28.397 --> 01:14:40.045]  Well, just briefly, Thomas, there are some unquestioned facts that Saudi Arabia was providing significant assistance to at least two of the 19 hijackers living in San Diego.
[01:14:40.105 --> 01:14:43.208]  The questions are, why was Saudi Arabia doing this?
[01:14:43.608 --> 01:14:47.611]  Was it also providing assistance to the other 17 hijackers?
[01:14:47.991 --> 01:14:55.076]  And then, why did the United States go to such lengths, including censuring the Congressional Inquiries Report
[01:14:55.576 --> 01:15:00.462]  Uh, on the events leading up to 9-11 that related to the role of Saudi Arabia.
[01:15:00.802 --> 01:15:06.568]  So there are a lot of unanswered questions, and Keys to the Kingdom starts with finding those answers.
[01:15:06.768 --> 01:15:11.834]  If you say that 40% of what's in this book is fake, I think that's gonna allow for avenues of discussion.
[01:15:11.854 --> 01:15:12.415]  Oh, that's good.
[01:15:13.385 --> 01:15:23.470]  All right, now we are going to our guest, Tony Farrell, served as a high-level intelligence analyst for South Yorkshire Police in Britain from 98 to 2010.
[01:15:24.330 --> 01:15:33.295]  In the days preceding the fifth anniversary of the 7-7 bombings, Farrell discovered the 9-11 attacks and 7-7 attacks were acts of state-sponsored terror.
[01:15:34.375 --> 01:15:37.517]  Gave me a more detailed bio on him.
[01:15:38.017 --> 01:15:42.600]  He has a university degree in Applied Statistics, Sheffield, Hallam University.
[01:15:42.620 --> 01:15:43.601]  I'm reading that right.
[01:15:43.921 --> 01:15:49.385]  Postgraduate degree in Criminal Intelligence Analytics and Analysis, Manchester University.
[01:15:49.785 --> 01:15:52.047]  Postgrad degree in Management Studies, Sheffield.
[01:15:52.807 --> 01:15:54.708]  And we continue on from there.
[01:15:55.269 --> 01:15:56.570]  Studying future threats.
[01:15:57.270 --> 01:16:05.192]  And he was the head of the South Yorkshire Police of their program to analyze terror attacks and threats.
[01:16:06.152 --> 01:16:08.932]  And he joins us now, former intelligence analyst.
[01:16:09.452 --> 01:16:12.373]  And I have some of the news articles here dealing with it.
[01:16:12.433 --> 01:16:17.134]  Police intelligence analyst fired for blowing whistle on false flag terror.
[01:16:17.474 --> 01:16:22.275]  Strategic threat assessment matrix concluded 7-7 was an inside job.
[01:16:22.335 --> 01:16:26.576]  Tony Farrell is our guest going over that.
[01:16:27.496 --> 01:16:28.977]  Thank you, Alex, and it's a pleasure to be on.
[01:16:47.836 --> 01:16:59.970]  So, tell us a little bit about yourself, your years of research and what brought you to going public with this information and what the police department thought when you brought them this information.
[01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:04.922]  Well, I'd been working for the police service as a principal analyst since 1998.
[01:17:05.042 --> 01:17:14.565]  I'd had local government experience and also worked for the regional government office, which is part of the Home Office, doing research into crime.
[01:17:14.625 --> 01:17:16.966]  So, I was quite experienced as a civilian.
[01:17:16.986 --> 01:17:18.087]  I wasn't a police officer.
[01:17:18.927 --> 01:17:21.689]  And, um, I was used to doing the strategic work.
[01:17:21.749 --> 01:17:25.852]  I wasn't privy to the detailed terrorist information from the Special Branch.
[01:17:26.393 --> 01:17:31.176]  But I did take an overview of the sanitized versions and pull them together in a strategic way.
[01:17:31.216 --> 01:17:33.338]  That was my assignment, my annual assignment.
[01:17:34.168 --> 01:17:50.279]  And what happened, Alex, was that, as you say, a week leading up to the 2010 July 5th anniversary, I was merely going along with my assignment, believing that I was just going to be able to complete it without any problems.
[01:17:52.572 --> 01:18:02.779]  Unfortunately, for me, running concurrently was my home study that did things like the history of geopolitics and what was going on in the world and a bit of church history.
[01:18:03.539 --> 01:18:06.641]  And all of a sudden, with a week to go, Alex, I dropped Tom.
[01:18:07.362 --> 01:18:18.249]  Through the likes of your programme, the possibility of 9-11 being an inside job, that quickly triggered me to do a lot of research in haste at home.
[01:18:19.009 --> 01:18:23.751]  I'm hoping to get reassurance that that wouldn't be the case, and unfortunately it was.
[01:18:23.851 --> 01:18:26.752]  As I could see, it was damning evidence.
[01:18:27.573 --> 01:18:28.273]  I panicked.
[01:18:28.293 --> 01:18:34.595]  I went to my church minister to say what they were doing in this situation, and he just said, well, terrible, isn't it?
[01:18:34.615 --> 01:18:37.376]  Have you thought about checking out 7-7?
[01:18:37.957 --> 01:18:40.017]  Well, I thought, oh dear, I'd better check that out too.
[01:18:40.498 --> 01:18:43.679]  And now we're only talking two or three days to go before the assignment's due.
[01:18:44.494 --> 01:18:48.637]  So I took a day's annual leave and did everything possible.
[01:18:49.217 --> 01:18:50.598]  Stayed awake for 24 hours.
[01:18:50.618 --> 01:18:51.879]  That too.
[01:18:51.899 --> 01:18:57.242]  It wasn't long before it was so obvious, Alex, that it was an inside job as well.
[01:18:58.163 --> 01:18:59.984]  There's just damning information out there.
[01:19:00.384 --> 01:19:09.370]  And that threw me in a problem, Alex, because I had to go to what we call an Intelligence Strategy Management Board on the 8th of July.
[01:19:11.115 --> 01:19:15.288]  And part of the assignment was a threat assessment that covered...
[01:19:15.925 --> 01:19:16.445]  Terrorism.
[01:19:16.946 --> 01:19:27.933]  And the component part would normally expect me to go along with all the government rhetoric and narrative on this, which would be to say that the threat, the large threat, was essentially from Islamic terrorism.
[01:19:28.453 --> 01:19:29.474]  Well, I'm sorry.
[01:19:29.814 --> 01:19:43.223]  If 9-11 was an inside job and 7-7 was an inside job, how could I possibly rely upon government rhetoric to actually say that it was Islamic terrorism?
[01:19:43.303 --> 01:19:44.084]  It's the biggest threat.
[01:19:44.364 --> 01:19:48.108]  Alright, Mr. Farrell, Mr. Farrell, quick break, stay right there.
[01:19:48.969 --> 01:19:52.073]  Absolutely, these are the big attacks, these are causing large numbers of death.
[01:19:52.413 --> 01:19:58.660]  If that's an inside job, then you do the statistical analysis, then government-sponsored terror is the most dangerous.
[01:19:59.021 --> 01:20:00.983]  We'll continue with where this led on the other side.
[01:20:01.483 --> 01:20:05.846]  If you drive for a living, you don't get paid to stop or wait in line.
[01:20:06.727 --> 01:20:08.889]  Keep your wheels moving with PrePass.
[01:20:09.309 --> 01:20:18.616]  Bypass weigh stations, fly by port of entry facilities, stay moving at highway speed, while the guy without PrePass waits in line.
[01:20:21.044 --> 01:20:22.826]  Save time, save money.
[01:20:23.046 --> 01:20:27.590]  Call 888-401-PASS to try prepass free.

[01:21:31.488 --> 01:21:36.033]  235 years ago our forefathers signed the Declaration of Independence to escape tyranny and oppression.
[01:21:36.194 --> 01:21:38.656]  Today there is a need to reinforce that declaration.

[01:22:00.216 --> 01:22:04.439]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:22:04.759 --> 01:22:05.340]  Number one.
[01:22:05.660 --> 01:22:09.664]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:22:09.944 --> 01:22:14.488]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:22:14.848 --> 01:22:15.268]  It's true.
[01:22:15.589 --> 01:22:20.993]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:22:21.274 --> 01:22:24.556]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:22:24.857 --> 01:22:28.560]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:29.321]  Number 4.
[01:22:29.561 --> 01:22:31.923]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:22:32.323 --> 01:22:35.707]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:22:36.007 --> 01:22:36.207]  Number 5.
[01:22:36.788 --> 01:22:40.711]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:22:40.931 --> 01:22:45.696]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:22:45.976 --> 01:22:49.997]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:22:50.157 --> 01:22:51.717]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:22:51.937 --> 01:22:54.017]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:22:54.177 --> 01:22:57.378]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:22:59.898 --> 01:23:00.799]  You've been lied to.
[01:23:01.119 --> 01:23:05.940]  Lied to by the Wall Street propaganda machine, the government, and the talking heads in the media.
[01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:07.980]  The market is in for another crash.
[01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:10.380]  Real estate is already in a double-dip recession.
[01:23:10.680 --> 01:23:13.861]  And if you want to keep your hard-earned money safe, this message is for you.
[01:23:14.401 --> 01:23:19.907]  My name is Brett Kitchen, and after losing 35% of my money when the market crashed, I said enough is enough.
[01:23:20.428 --> 01:23:28.697]  I searched and discovered a way to safely grow my money, participate in potential double-digit gains, but also have my money protected when the crashes come.
[01:23:29.097 --> 01:23:31.540]  Plus, it could save you thousands in taxes.
[01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:41.382]  I want you to get a free copy of my new book, Safe Money Millionaire, where I share this powerful tool that people like Walt Disney and JCPenney used to safely grow their wealth.
[01:23:41.862 --> 01:23:43.002]  Call 1-800-675-1640 right now to get your free copy.
[01:23:43.122 --> 01:23:43.822]  Again, that's 1-800-675-1640.
[01:23:43.842 --> 01:23:46.363]  I'm giving away a limited number of copies today, so call 1-800-675-1640.
[01:24:23.749 --> 01:24:28.819]  So for 12 years, for the big city government, and for the central government,
[01:24:29.853 --> 01:24:31.394]  of the Home Office, the UK.
[01:24:32.095 --> 01:24:37.538]  He's an analyst looking at future terror threats, analyzing where the terror threat comes from.
[01:24:38.259 --> 01:24:43.822]  Well, if you're actually a real researcher, you would know that there was BBC, London Telegraph.
[01:24:44.603 --> 01:24:45.564]  I've got all the articles.
[01:24:46.324 --> 01:24:49.546]  Police seize files of spy linked to IRA murders.
[01:24:50.307 --> 01:24:51.047]  It goes on and on.
[01:24:51.127 --> 01:24:54.369]  Double Agent was the real IRA's Omaha bomb team.
[01:24:54.810 --> 01:24:59.273]  And I've had these guys on, and hidden in all these articles, because they report on it, but they bury it.
[01:25:00.033 --> 01:25:07.037]  It turns out that 7 out of 10 IRA commanders, going back 50 years on average, were British intelligence.
[01:25:07.657 --> 01:25:15.522]  Staging terror attacks as a pretext to stay in Northern Ireland and to take the rights of Brits, now the most surveilled people on Earth.
[01:25:15.802 --> 01:25:16.763]  But side issue!
[01:25:17.503 --> 01:25:20.244]  The point is, is that this stuff's all hidden in plain view.
[01:25:20.664 --> 01:25:30.087]  Now, Tony Farrell, their chief analyst, you know, just a week or so out from this big report, he, in his research, he finds reality.
[01:25:30.727 --> 01:25:33.648]  And what happened when you brought them the report, sir?
[01:25:33.688 --> 01:25:34.348]  Please continue.
[01:25:35.128 --> 01:25:43.551]  Well, the first thing I did, Alex, when this horrible realization occurred to me, I thought that I had to go on alert management.
[01:25:44.156 --> 01:25:48.458]  And I did that, Alex, with a briefing note, because we were getting very close to the deadline.
[01:25:48.498 --> 01:25:49.838]  This was the 6th of July.
[01:25:49.958 --> 01:25:52.639]  The deadline was required on the 8th of July.
[01:25:52.659 --> 01:25:56.041]  So I made it my business to alert management.
[01:25:56.201 --> 01:25:56.761]  It is shocking.
[01:25:56.801 --> 01:25:59.162]  I shot them with a briefing note.
[01:26:00.362 --> 01:26:09.927]  That gave all the hyperlinks, so I alerted them to your films, I alerted them to Blues Change and the compelling videos that were out there.
[01:26:10.367 --> 01:26:24.114]  That was on 9-11 and likewise with 7-7, the research, the compelling research, and I was saying to management, look, it's a case of, Houston, we've got a problem here and we need to have a look at it because things aren't the way they seem.
[01:26:26.398 --> 01:26:41.983]  That's shop management, and they really, on the 7th of July, they really tried to wrap me up in cotton socks, Alex, and tried to get me to go along with it and not rock the boat and go to the Intelligence Strategy Management Board on the 8th.
[01:26:42.603 --> 01:26:46.947]  Disregarding what I believe to be the threat and just carry on as normal.
[01:26:47.187 --> 01:26:54.653]  I'd done all the work, so I was in a position where I could have actually carried out and handed over the assignment to their satisfaction.
[01:26:55.033 --> 01:26:55.854]  They'd have loved that.
[01:26:56.495 --> 01:26:59.117]  My problem was, it would go against my conscience.
[01:26:59.898 --> 01:27:04.643]  And quite frankly, Alex, this was a case I couldn't keep silent on.
[01:27:04.843 --> 01:27:09.287]  Silence, you know, it's not golden, it's yellow.
[01:27:09.507 --> 01:27:11.169]  And I wasn't going to be cowardly over this.
[01:27:11.229 --> 01:27:12.430]  I had to make a stance.
[01:27:12.490 --> 01:27:21.559]  It was a defining moment on the 5th anniversary, that 7th of July, 2010, I came to that decision in my own conscience that I must make the stance.
[01:27:22.020 --> 01:27:23.681]  And on the 8th of July, I went in,
[01:27:24.913 --> 01:27:33.339]  I'd made my stance and refused to handle the product that they wanted later on for that afternoon's presentation to the Intelligence Strategy Management Board.
[01:27:34.119 --> 01:27:36.261]  I was asked then to explain myself in a report.
[01:27:36.301 --> 01:27:41.925]  I was sent home, away from the office, where they did an audit of my computer.
[01:27:43.170 --> 01:27:51.114]  And I was asked to come back in a few days' time with a report that explained why I felt necessary to make the stance, which I duly did.
[01:27:51.134 --> 01:27:52.655]  I told them all the reasons.
[01:27:53.095 --> 01:27:57.538]  I made inferences on the strategic threat to do with the New World Order.
[01:27:58.358 --> 01:28:14.851]  And I made inferences that, yes, 9-11 was an inside job, 7-7 was an inside job, there was media control, and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are unjustified and morally wrong, and they were the purpose of furthering the New World Order's satanic agenda.
[01:28:15.571 --> 01:28:25.679]  And, of course, that didn't go down well, but it was a report that didn't pull any punches, and I simply said, look, I cannot go against conscience,
[01:28:26.925 --> 01:28:38.791]  The 9th Commandment, I'm a Christian, the 9th Commandment says thou shalt not bear false witness and I think that my assessment was that this wasn't done as Tony Blair blurted out.
[01:28:38.811 --> 01:28:40.772]  7-7 wasn't done in the name of Islam.
[01:28:41.272 --> 01:28:52.437]  This was done to blame Islam by Tony Blair and I wasn't going to be a false witness and do anything that would perpetuate, countenance the perpetuation of that lie.
[01:28:52.957 --> 01:28:53.838]  So I stood firm
[01:28:54.754 --> 01:28:58.577]  I went on annual leave for three weeks while management decided what on earth to do with this.
[01:28:59.157 --> 01:29:01.459]  They held some conferences in my absence.
[01:29:02.079 --> 01:29:08.644]  I was very quickly told that there would be a hearing, that I wouldn't be in the office ever again.
[01:29:08.664 --> 01:29:12.607]  So I appeared at the hearing on the 2nd of September.
[01:29:13.757 --> 01:29:17.278]  They asked me, uh, had I changed my opinion on any of this.
[01:29:17.678 --> 01:29:24.061]  I hadn't, but my opinion, you know, in the time off, it researched even more and my opinion has become stronger.
[01:29:24.081 --> 01:29:28.862]  So I was absolutely convinced now, uh, no doubt whatsoever that it was right to make the stance.
[01:29:29.683 --> 01:29:32.564]  They felt that my beliefs were incompatible with their role.
[01:29:32.584 --> 01:29:41.247]  Um, in some respect, I agree with them in the context that, uh, Tony, Tony, stay there.
[01:29:43.580 --> 01:29:44.902]  Yeah, that was a short segment.
[01:29:44.942 --> 01:29:50.689]  Long 18-minute segment coming up with the chief terror threat analyst who was fired over this.
[01:29:50.709 --> 01:29:51.110]  Stay with us.
[01:29:51.670 --> 01:29:52.551]  We're on the march.
[01:29:53.072 --> 01:29:54.654]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.595 --> 01:29:58.278]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.308 --> 01:30:05.551]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:30:05.871 --> 01:30:06.471]  Number one.
[01:30:06.772 --> 01:30:09.934]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:10.194 --> 01:30:10.774]  Number two.
[01:30:11.055 --> 01:30:15.618]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:15.958 --> 01:30:16.398]  It's true.
[01:30:16.698 --> 01:30:21.261]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:21.562 --> 01:30:22.122]  Number three.
[01:30:22.402 --> 01:30:25.684]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:30:25.984 --> 01:30:29.687]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:30:29.887 --> 01:30:30.428]  Number 4.
[01:30:30.668 --> 01:30:33.050]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:30:33.431 --> 01:30:36.834]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:30:37.115 --> 01:30:37.335]  Number 5.
[01:30:37.915 --> 01:30:41.840]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:30:42.060 --> 01:30:46.825]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:31:02.216 --> 01:31:03.718]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:31:03.938 --> 01:31:08.963]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:31:09.243 --> 01:31:10.604]  Saving means to make money.
[01:31:10.785 --> 01:31:19.573]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:31:20.294 --> 01:31:27.399]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:31:27.819 --> 01:31:35.444]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:31:35.824 --> 01:31:40.747]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[01:32:04.925 --> 01:32:05.845]  Tyranny is here.
[01:32:06.205 --> 01:32:09.766]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:32:10.066 --> 01:32:12.347]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:32:12.367 --> 01:32:17.808]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:32:18.228 --> 01:32:24.470]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:32:24.890 --> 01:32:30.432]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:32:30.832 --> 01:32:34.533]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:32:35.053 --> 01:32:39.034]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:32:39.334 --> 01:32:44.856]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:32:45.276 --> 01:32:48.257]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:32:48.837 --> 01:32:50.258]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:32:50.798 --> 01:32:51.238]  It's here.

[01:33:04.209 --> 01:33:04.950]  Big Brother.
[01:33:05.210 --> 01:33:06.491]  Mainstream media.
[01:33:06.872 --> 01:33:08.113]  Government cover-ups.
[01:33:08.253 --> 01:33:09.254]  You want answers?
[01:33:09.514 --> 01:33:10.615]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:11.596 --> 01:33:15.539]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:25.058 --> 01:33:28.100]  What do you mean I don't support your system?
[01:33:28.161 --> 01:33:30.202]  I go to court when I have to?
[01:33:30.602 --> 01:33:47.795]  Ladies and gentlemen, it has been the naivete of the public in the West that has allowed unspeakable corruption to take deep, deep root into every sector of our society, only basing the hard facts.
[01:33:48.922 --> 01:33:56.124]  ...gives us any chance to turn the tide and then ultimately reverse what's happened to our civilization.
[01:33:57.685 --> 01:33:59.765]  Corruption either gets worse or gets better.
[01:33:59.785 --> 01:34:01.046]  It doesn't stand in one place.
[01:34:01.506 --> 01:34:05.247]  And right now it is... it was slowing because of an awakening.
[01:34:05.287 --> 01:34:07.088]  Now the system is steamrolling.
[01:34:07.548 --> 01:34:13.770]  They are releasing every trick in the book to overwhelm us right now using psychological warfare principles.
[01:34:14.750 --> 01:34:16.372]  We are being bum-rushed right now.
[01:34:16.632 --> 01:34:21.198]  We are under a full, no-holds-bar, 100% commitment assault.
[01:34:21.218 --> 01:34:24.081]  They're getting ready for even bigger wars, false flags.
[01:34:24.422 --> 01:34:26.885]  You can see all the preparatory brainwashing going on.
[01:34:26.905 --> 01:34:30.048]  Now's the time to pray, but also take action.
[01:34:30.819 --> 01:34:32.900]  Now, we're going to go back to our guest here in just a moment.
[01:34:32.940 --> 01:34:44.847]  If you go to the Drudge Report, DrudgeReport.com, we've also got this stuff up at InfoWars.com and PrisonBlender.com, but nobody knows how to present the idiocy of the establishment like Matt Drudge.
[01:34:46.528 --> 01:34:50.830]  And Joseph Curl and all the other great folks over there at DrudgeReport.com.
[01:34:51.331 --> 01:34:52.091]  Bernanke!
[01:34:52.592 --> 01:34:54.152]  Gold, not money!
[01:34:55.413 --> 01:34:56.574]  It's actually a video clip!
[01:34:57.295 --> 01:34:59.357]  I don't know what Deb was talking about earlier because I hadn't seen this.
[01:34:59.377 --> 01:35:00.278]  I just saw it during the break.
[01:35:00.298 --> 01:35:13.210]  We're going to be playing that next hour and I've got some guests in studio where Ron Paul talks about dollar devaluation and how QE3 is going to cause more inflation and Bernanke says there's no inflation.
[01:35:14.251 --> 01:35:16.674]  It's like saying the sky isn't blue or the sun doesn't come up in the morning.
[01:35:17.314 --> 01:35:20.458]  And Bernanke goes on and tells Paul, gold is not money.
[01:35:20.798 --> 01:35:22.059]  Federal Reserve notes are money.
[01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:31.068]  And then if you scroll down on Drudge, he's got Bernanke announcing that they may launch QE3, which is Weimar Republic-style inflation.
[01:35:32.157 --> 01:35:53.932]  uh... so uh... meanwhile the depression so bad there's copper thieves running around robbing crime is exploding but uh... the government says everything is wonderful we're going back to our valiant guest to break down his view of 9-11 and 7-7 from a criminologist and statisticians uh... expert of view and and and what evidence uh... showed him that these were blaring
[01:35:54.572 --> 01:35:55.433]  Inside jobs.
[01:35:55.553 --> 01:35:57.674]  Gee, I think the hijackers trained at U.S.
[01:35:57.714 --> 01:36:00.096]  bases admitted, but nobody investigates that.
[01:36:00.136 --> 01:36:04.419]  I think that might be a little place to start, but we're going to talk to him here in just a moment.
[01:36:04.439 --> 01:36:14.866]  Before we go back to our guest, I want to just remind you, speaking of gold and silver, Ted Anderson has a deal going today.
[01:36:14.886 --> 01:36:18.268]  It may end or go up in price tomorrow.
[01:36:18.648 --> 01:36:20.550]  Big Brother, The Orwellian Nightmare Come True.
[01:36:20.690 --> 01:36:21.250]  Excellent book.
[01:36:21.310 --> 01:36:23.151]  Free and The American Dream.
[01:36:23.251 --> 01:36:23.491]  Great.
[01:36:25.833 --> 01:36:29.354]  Illustrated, documentary, cartoon about the banking cartel.
[01:36:29.754 --> 01:36:31.855]  Both of these free for two silver dollars.
[01:36:32.215 --> 01:36:32.935]  Shipping is free, $75.
[01:36:33.276 --> 01:36:37.997]  You can't buy two silver dollars for 75 bucks, folks, and then get free shipping and all of this.
[01:36:38.037 --> 01:36:38.858]  It's a loss leader.
[01:36:39.258 --> 01:36:43.019]  Ted wants to introduce you to gold and silver, and he wants to get this book and these videos out.
[01:36:44.260 --> 01:36:47.081]  888, well, the number to call to get my films is 888-253-3139.
[01:36:49.702 --> 01:36:57.584]  The number to call Ted is 800-686-2237, 800-686-2237.
[01:36:57.624 --> 01:37:01.085]  Again, one more time, 800-686-2237.
[01:37:02.506 --> 01:37:11.088]  And lastly, speaking of satanic elite, the world leaders, including from Europe, are meeting starting tomorrow in Northern California.
[01:37:11.168 --> 01:37:13.129]  I'm the only person to ever sneak in and get out with footage.
[01:37:13.749 --> 01:37:32.013]  Others have tried and failed, CBS News, Vanity Fair, but they also reported that it's a bunch of rich, mainly conservative leaders having gay sex, and I'm just saying they're hypocrites is the point, and taking drugs and getting drunk and worshipping a big stone deity.
[01:37:32.994 --> 01:37:34.194]  And I happen to have it on tape.
[01:37:35.274 --> 01:37:40.657]  Two films on one DVD, The Order of Death and Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[01:37:40.677 --> 01:37:40.657]  $19.95.
[01:37:40.977 --> 01:37:42.678]  And you get Invisible Empire free.
[01:37:43.078 --> 01:37:47.661]  Getting into even more of the information by Jason Bermas and the book, Big Brother, The Orwellian Nightmare Come True.
[01:37:47.681 --> 01:37:49.182]  We've never offered a special this good.
[01:37:49.202 --> 01:37:49.182]  $19.95.
[01:37:50.202 --> 01:37:52.063]  It ends at the end of the month of July.
[01:37:52.103 --> 01:37:52.984]  It's the Bohemian Grove.
[01:37:53.884 --> 01:38:20.234]  uh... by one get two free special info wars dot com okay i'm done our guest now will have the floor uh... tony for ralph served as the yorkshire police twelve years as their chief intelligence analyst for future terror threats he has what three degrees in criminology and statistics uh... and the point here is is that he was found this big report on future threats and said well uh... there are no show there some muslim terrorist
[01:38:21.061 --> 01:38:23.742]  But the big threat is government-sponsored.
[01:38:23.762 --> 01:38:24.423]  Here's my evidence.
[01:38:24.443 --> 01:38:25.763]  They said, we don't want to see that.
[01:38:25.783 --> 01:38:27.604]  It's not compatible with our narrative.
[01:38:28.224 --> 01:38:31.126]  So you hire analysts to give you what the threat is.
[01:38:31.846 --> 01:38:34.808]  And even upon the threat of being fired, does he want to change your mind?
[01:38:35.328 --> 01:38:38.509]  And he said, no, I do not renounce my Christianity.
[01:38:38.749 --> 01:38:41.831]  So they said, well, we're going to politically burn you at the stake and fired him.
[01:38:42.051 --> 01:38:43.112]  You've gotten up to that point.
[01:38:43.172 --> 01:38:46.493]  Continue, sir, on what's happened since, why you're now going public.
[01:38:46.713 --> 01:38:48.414]  And then let's break down 7-7 and 9-11 from your expert perspective.
[01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:58.608]  Right, well, it's interesting, Alex, because the way they actually dismissed me, it was quite bizarre.
[01:38:58.728 --> 01:38:59.850]  It was a solemn occasion.
[01:39:01.111 --> 01:39:06.016]  They dismissed me not for my incompatible beliefs, so that made my position untenable.
[01:39:06.036 --> 01:39:08.239]  There was no allegation here of any misconduct.
[01:39:09.809 --> 01:39:12.691]  They almost encouraged me to appeal.
[01:39:12.711 --> 01:39:19.638]  In one sense, they said, look, there's an appeals process to the Police Authority Appeals Committee.
[01:39:20.058 --> 01:39:25.383]  That's not the Chief Constable, that's the politicians and independent members of the Police Authority.
[01:39:25.403 --> 01:39:26.604]  That'll be in front of the panel.
[01:39:27.144 --> 01:39:30.147]  So I always said I probably wouldn't appeal.
[01:39:31.588 --> 01:39:35.229]  They seemed to want me to appeal, so I took them up on the offer.
[01:39:35.669 --> 01:39:48.291]  I appealed, but it didn't mean no good, because they still dismissed me on the 26th of November, which left me four days to get this into an employment tribunal.
[01:39:48.951 --> 01:39:58.613]  I'd been to my lawyers at that stage, and they said that this might be, you know, your beliefs may be protected under certain laws, so they may have acted unlawfully, it depends,
[01:39:59.193 --> 01:40:04.336]  But it's worth a try and they're in the employment bracket, religious and belief regulations from 2003.
[01:40:04.717 --> 01:40:13.142]  So there was a potential discrimination case here and also with the human rights legislation there was a potential unfair dismissal.
[01:40:13.622 --> 01:40:20.826]  So I put it into an employment tribunal situation and that's running, that's ongoing at the moment.
[01:40:20.886 --> 01:40:24.709]  It's quite interesting, we've had a pre-hearing review
[01:40:25.450 --> 01:40:26.311]  We're good to go.
[01:40:48.183 --> 01:40:54.909]  For the, I believe it's the 7th, 8th and 9th of September substantive hearing.
[01:40:55.489 --> 01:41:05.057]  But, the key for me I think is, and the key strategy for all of this, is to keep the actual belief, the discussion about the belief in court.
[01:41:05.458 --> 01:41:09.461]  So I fully intend, if I can, to launch an appeal.
[01:41:09.481 --> 01:41:15.346]  My barrister thinks that there are grounds for appeal here, so we can mount a legal challenge in court.
[01:41:16.013 --> 01:41:16.494]  We're good to go.
[01:41:32.742 --> 01:41:46.526]  Well, first off, sir, just to add here, this is modern heresy for you to get fired when you're hired to analyze what groups are really behind the terrorism and try to track where the future threats are coming from.
[01:41:46.546 --> 01:41:59.009]  I mean, here in the U.S., we have Fast and Furious, where for two years, the Attorney General directed the FBI, DEA, and ATF to ship high-powered weapons into Mexico to then blame it on the Second Amendment.
[01:41:59.449 --> 01:42:08.916]  And even though this has all come out, they've now come out with the anti-gun moves using the event that they are admitted to have triggered.
[01:42:08.936 --> 01:42:11.418]  So they're going on like nothing happened.
[01:42:11.458 --> 01:42:20.024]  So it's not heresy to know that governments have staged events against their own people as a pretext to get control.
[01:42:20.104 --> 01:42:22.066]  That is in the Encyclopedia Britannica.
[01:42:22.486 --> 01:42:24.508]  That is a known fact.
[01:42:25.697 --> 01:42:29.020]  We have WikiLeaks three years ago releasing army manuals in the U.S.
[01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:32.984]  where they train army captains and special ops how to stage a false flag.
[01:42:33.004 --> 01:42:39.490]  You know, if you're in a third world area and overwhelmed, stage a massacre and then blame it on the enemy.
[01:42:39.530 --> 01:42:41.652]  That'll force and multiply the people to help you.
[01:42:42.273 --> 01:42:55.278]  And the argument here is an ancient 3,000-year-old Persian gambit, of course, in chess to sacrifice a pawn or another piece in an opening move to make your enemy miscalculate and draw them in a sacrifice.
[01:42:55.698 --> 01:43:01.060]  That's why the military does this, because they say, well, if we send in 100 troops, that'll draw the enemy out.
[01:43:01.380 --> 01:43:04.461]  The 100 troops will be killed, but then we'll see the enemy's strength.
[01:43:04.901 --> 01:43:08.103]  We can then cut them off at a pincer, saving 10,000 troops.
[01:43:08.523 --> 01:43:10.104]  It's a cold-blooded calculation.
[01:43:10.364 --> 01:43:11.444]  So that's why they do this.
[01:43:11.885 --> 01:43:13.185]  They see Islam as a threat.
[01:43:13.906 --> 01:43:15.587]  They want to take over the oil and resources.
[01:43:15.987 --> 01:43:17.267]  They want to invade these countries.
[01:43:17.307 --> 01:43:18.788]  So, of course, they're going to stage some events.
[01:43:19.268 --> 01:43:21.510]  They call it a justifiable sacrifice.
[01:43:21.930 --> 01:43:23.150]  That's the sick mindset.
[01:43:23.190 --> 01:43:29.734]  But to say we're conspiracy theorists or we're crazy because we know governments admittedly do this, it doesn't hold water.
[01:43:31.516 --> 01:43:32.176]  That's right, Alex.
[01:43:32.277 --> 01:43:39.181]  And in times, you mentioned George Orwell there, and in times of universal deceit, telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act, I'm afraid.
[01:43:39.502 --> 01:43:39.902]  It does.
[01:43:40.142 --> 01:43:52.431]  So continuing now, you're challenging all of this, but what about the fact that you're an analyst and they're not letting you give your terror threat prognosis?
[01:43:52.811 --> 01:43:59.396]  That also sounds like a national security issue, that they're not letting you get your report out about who the terrorists are.
[01:43:59.736 --> 01:44:00.677]  Well, that's right.
[01:44:01.077 --> 01:44:08.383]  I offered to provide them a comprehensive report, not just a... This Strategic Threat Assessment Matrix was rather crude and simplistic.
[01:44:09.063 --> 01:44:11.545]  And I believe it's gimmicky.
[01:44:11.965 --> 01:44:13.226]  It's a distraction, Alex.
[01:44:14.327 --> 01:44:22.233]  And I'm afraid that I think all the principal intelligence analysts in each of the 43 police forces in England and Wales, it's they that want sacking.
[01:44:22.273 --> 01:44:28.918]  If you don't stand up and say, this is no good, it's a massive distraction from actually doing intelligence analysis.
[01:44:29.818 --> 01:44:36.020]  I'm afraid, Alex, that if you're an intelligence analyst, you're not a spin doctor.
[01:44:36.541 --> 01:44:40.742]  And I'm afraid I wasn't preferred to be a spin doctor in this instance.
[01:44:41.082 --> 01:44:45.264]  And I just wish that others would stand up and look outside now.
[01:44:45.324 --> 01:44:57.948]  And I hope by doing this, news will break to other analysts that they've got to do this and we have to have a cure-all and tell it as it is without causing fear or favour.
[01:44:58.348 --> 01:45:01.530]  Well, Tony, that's a great point you raised.
[01:45:01.870 --> 01:45:04.532]  We know in England now, the former head of MI6 has admitted it.
[01:45:04.912 --> 01:45:06.873]  We know the White House and Downing Street memos show it.
[01:45:06.913 --> 01:45:21.903]  It's confirmed that Tony Blair and George Bush got together in 10 Downing Street and at the White House on two occasions and ordered their intelligence chiefs to fix intelligence around weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear, in Iraq.
[01:45:22.583 --> 01:45:24.884]  Tony Blair responded with the 45-minute speech.
[01:45:27.065 --> 01:45:28.965]  Powell responded with the anthrax vial.
[01:45:29.786 --> 01:45:30.946]  And they did all of this.
[01:45:31.326 --> 01:45:37.948]  And now we know they went in to MI6 and to the CIA and ordered the analysts to issue false reports.
[01:45:38.449 --> 01:45:39.269]  Both countries
[01:45:40.229 --> 01:45:45.150]  Analysts, including Dr. David Kelly, refused, and so of course they killed Kelly.
[01:45:46.690 --> 01:45:53.792]  And now we know that they created the Office of Special Plans, fake analysts, to create fake reports.
[01:45:53.852 --> 01:46:01.633]  So this is a major scandal that they're telling you to basically fix intelligence analysis for them.
[01:46:01.673 --> 01:46:05.414]  I think that's even bigger than quote them saying, we're going after you for your beliefs.
[01:46:06.574 --> 01:46:08.915]  Or, I mean, do you see where I'm going with this?
[01:46:09.705 --> 01:46:10.206]  Absolutely.
[01:46:10.486 --> 01:46:12.749]  And I wasn't going to bow down to their sacred cows.
[01:46:12.809 --> 01:46:18.476]  I wasn't going to bow down to their Caesar, because I've served something greater than that, and that's my God.
[01:46:19.136 --> 01:46:25.985]  And my conscience simply wouldn't allow me to go along with this monstrous lie, and I just couldn't do it.
[01:46:27.366 --> 01:46:41.193]  And that's what led me to get the sack, and I'm afraid if they're actually exerting that kind of pressure on other analysts, well, if they want to have a conscience, then they're going to have to get the sack, unless this is blown open.
[01:46:41.513 --> 01:46:44.675]  And I feel as though there's a chink here in the armour, Alex.
[01:46:44.755 --> 01:46:48.517]  I think the British police force, they can be put under pressure here.
[01:46:49.557 --> 01:46:55.380]  Well, they better, because the corrupt banks that run England and the US and Europe
[01:47:09.841 --> 01:47:10.041]  I think?
[01:47:27.987 --> 01:47:42.889]  That she heard the leaders of Al-Qaeda on the phone with the CIA being directed in the year leading up to the day of 9-11 in sex slaves, weapons, drugs, laundered cash.
[01:47:44.110 --> 01:47:47.851]  Of course, we know Al-Qaeda was created by our own government, so that makes sense.
[01:47:48.371 --> 01:47:51.271]  And she tries to bring that to our supervisors and is told to shut up.
[01:47:51.951 --> 01:47:56.492]  So there's not an analyst, there's somebody listening to all of this going on.
[01:47:56.512 --> 01:48:02.213]  And there's hundreds and hundreds of other people who have seen and witnessed the same thing.
[01:48:03.113 --> 01:48:04.834]  Let's look at 7-7 first.
[01:48:05.974 --> 01:48:11.035]  Of course, the 7-7 bombings in London, for those that don't remember, used to sell the Iraq War
[01:48:12.302 --> 01:48:12.903]  And more.
[01:48:13.604 --> 01:48:16.207]  Break down the big, blaring issues with that, sir.
[01:48:17.007 --> 01:48:29.882]  Right, okay, well, 7th of July 2005, London bombings went off, and there were three underground stations, and a bomb that went off on Tavistock Square.
[01:48:30.943 --> 01:48:33.506]  Now, a few things that happened.
[01:48:35.045 --> 01:48:39.468]  Um, 52 people were killed, plus four others, which was the alleged suicide bombers.
[01:48:39.968 --> 01:48:42.770]  Now, there was no inquiry into who committed the crime.
[01:48:42.790 --> 01:48:49.415]  Tony Blair immediately said that an inquiry would be a ludicrous diversion.
[01:48:49.455 --> 01:48:50.716]  That's another disgrace!
[01:48:51.096 --> 01:48:53.358]  And instead, we've been told who is guilty.
[01:48:54.005 --> 01:49:04.794]  And we've had a diversionary inquiry, later on down the line, just about the intelligence failures, where the real agenda is simply to conceal the truth.
[01:49:04.854 --> 01:49:08.597]  As you say, you know, just as it was in the Hutton inquiry for Dr David Kelly.
[01:49:09.891 --> 01:49:17.377]  There was a poor quality and anonymous official version of the London bombings and that's deeply suspicious and unacceptable.
[01:49:17.978 --> 01:49:21.541]  Add to that there's never been a proper inquiry.
[01:49:21.601 --> 01:49:23.402]  So you've got big problems there Alex.
[01:49:23.422 --> 01:49:30.468]  We've got a government to give us one narrative of 7-7 without allowing all the other competing narratives to be officially heard in the process.
[01:49:30.908 --> 01:49:32.249]  It's simply insulting.
[01:49:32.369 --> 01:49:33.370]  It's a disgrace.
[01:49:34.153 --> 01:49:38.715]  Now, a key thing here is the mock terror exercise that occurred.
[01:49:38.755 --> 01:49:41.156]  Now, this is fantastic, this.
[01:49:41.996 --> 01:49:54.482]  Peter Power, advisor consultant, when all the bombs go off, shortly afterwards, we're talking an hour or so after the bombs have gone off, this guy, Peter Power, advisor consultant, goes on TV and announces this.
[01:49:54.522 --> 01:49:57.343]  He says that this is amazing.
[01:49:59.713 --> 01:50:13.696]  The terror attack, the terror training drill that we are into at the moment, where there's a thousand staff involved, is actually, we're simulating bombs going off at the exact same stations and locations as it actually happened.
[01:50:13.716 --> 01:50:22.278]  Now in statistical terms, Alex, it's as certain as certain can be that a drill exercise might be the exact same locations and dates of the actual bombs.
[01:50:22.718 --> 01:50:24.839]  That could not have occurred by mere coincidence.
[01:50:25.439 --> 01:50:26.839]  Now was that investigated?
[01:50:27.828 --> 01:50:28.048]  No.
[01:50:28.609 --> 01:50:29.270]  Should it have been?
[01:50:29.290 --> 01:50:31.473]  Well, you're damn right it should.
[01:50:32.033 --> 01:50:33.315]  And by the way, we're going to break.
[01:50:33.335 --> 01:50:34.376]  We got two more segments.
[01:50:42.290 --> 01:50:43.251]  All right, stay there, sir.
[01:50:43.291 --> 01:50:45.554]  We gotta go to break, and we're gonna come back and let you finish on that.
[01:50:45.594 --> 01:50:49.798]  We got one little segment in that first five minutes of the hour, then we've got guests coming in.
[01:50:49.818 --> 01:50:56.446]  We'll definitely have to have you back up in the future just to go over your own research, but absolutely, they ran drills on 9-11.
[01:50:56.466 --> 01:51:01.031]  Oklahoma City, they always run a drill to cover the real attack.
[01:51:01.923 --> 01:51:04.684]  Where can you find a super strength potassium iodide supplement?
[01:51:05.004 --> 01:51:07.324]  Right here at ThyroidKI.com.

[01:52:02.483 --> 01:52:06.107]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:52:06.507 --> 01:52:09.511]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:52:09.751 --> 01:52:14.516]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:52:14.536 --> 01:52:20.803]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:52:20.943 --> 01:52:23.186]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:52:23.706 --> 01:52:23.986]  Tim Geithner?
[01:52:24.006 --> 01:52:24.246]  Bernanke?
[01:52:24.266 --> 01:52:24.806]  They're arsonists!
[01:52:24.827 --> 01:52:25.607]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:52:25.627 --> 01:52:27.968]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:52:42.614 --> 01:52:44.435]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:52:44.736 --> 01:52:49.559]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:52:49.879 --> 01:52:59.006]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:53:00.660 --> 01:53:02.241]  What would you do with a check for $25,000?
[01:53:03.182 --> 01:53:08.305]  What if you could eliminate all of your credit card debt in 90 days and keep all of your money?
[01:53:08.506 --> 01:53:18.773]  Hi, I'm Jason Davenport, and I've just completed ZeroDebt100.com, a program that stops and prevents debt collections of all kinds, including debt collectors and foreclosures, with guaranteed results.
[01:53:19.013 --> 01:53:20.234]  Forget loan modification.
[01:53:20.314 --> 01:53:26.519]  Zero Debt showed me how to get the banks to pay my property taxes and insurance while stopping my foreclosure without paying one dime.
[01:53:26.679 --> 01:53:31.943]  An attorney tried to garnish my wages but the court denied his request because of what I filed from the Zero Debt program.
[01:53:32.124 --> 01:53:36.087]  Find out how I did this by calling Zero Debt today at 800-477-9256.
[01:53:36.427 --> 01:53:44.834]  Tell them Jason sent you and ask for the Zero Debt special and the free bonus promotion about stopping an IRS levy and getting your money back.
[01:53:44.994 --> 01:53:46.516]  Tell them Jason sent you and call 800-477-9256.
[01:53:46.536 --> 01:53:46.576]  800-477-9256.
[01:53:46.636 --> 01:53:46.817]  That's 800-477-9256.
[01:53:46.837 --> 01:53:47.537]  Or visit www.zerodet100.com.
[01:54:31.240 --> 01:54:34.942]  You know, a lot of people engage in delusional magical thinking.
[01:54:36.402 --> 01:54:42.846]  They think that you can just decide there aren't false flag terror attacks.
[01:54:44.266 --> 01:54:47.948]  I mean, you read the history of France and England fighting with each other and others.
[01:54:48.348 --> 01:54:49.629]  They were constantly doing it.
[01:54:50.697 --> 01:54:52.499]  Constantly doing dirty tricks against each other.
[01:54:53.159 --> 01:54:55.741]  Blowing up an ammo dump and then blaming it on the other.
[01:54:55.781 --> 01:54:56.642]  This is war!
[01:54:57.463 --> 01:55:02.687]  The issue is war is now being used against us domestically by our own governments.
[01:55:03.288 --> 01:55:07.811]  That's an act of warshipping tens of thousands of firearms into Mexico, then blaming it on the Second Amendment.
[01:55:08.272 --> 01:55:10.213]  And it's admitted the government did that.
[01:55:10.954 --> 01:55:11.294]  Okay?
[01:55:11.434 --> 01:55:14.097]  People, we need to grow up or they're going to keep using this tool.
[01:55:14.137 --> 01:55:16.218]  So, this is a short five-minute segment, sir.
[01:55:16.238 --> 01:55:18.460]  We've got one more little five-minute segment and we'll have to have you back.
[01:55:19.321 --> 01:55:28.806]  I'm continuing talking to Tony Farrell, who was in his police department and also worked in the federal government as a top terror analyst, ran into all this false flag history and information.
[01:55:29.686 --> 01:55:38.391]  You've gotten into the drills of 7-7 on the exact same bus, exact same place, exact same time, exact same trains, exact same place, exact same time.
[01:55:38.971 --> 01:55:45.554]  Actuaries have been done, it's in the thousands of truck-to-gillions, that's, you know, billions of times all the sand grains in the world.
[01:55:45.574 --> 01:55:46.895]  It's nearing infinity.
[01:55:47.855 --> 01:55:53.981]  I mean, it's the equivalent of finding a unicorn, a leprechaun, and Santa Claus in your backyard jumping rope.
[01:55:54.101 --> 01:55:56.844]  It doesn't exist, but please continue.
[01:55:57.344 --> 01:56:07.654]  Yeah, the spineless, anonymous Home Office official version, that had flaws in it that subsequently the government had to admit that they were lies.
[01:56:08.655 --> 01:56:11.658]  The 740 ghost train that went from London to
[01:56:13.158 --> 01:56:13.739]  I don't know.
[01:56:31.642 --> 01:56:33.004]  And of course, why run the drill?
[01:56:33.044 --> 01:56:38.290]  Well, you've got some young Arab gentlemen who are working, you know, with the government, who are teachers and things.
[01:56:38.630 --> 01:56:41.053]  They're taking part in a patriotic anti-terror drill.
[01:56:41.073 --> 01:56:43.315]  Uh-oh, something's gonna happen.
[01:56:43.335 --> 01:56:44.436]  Yeah.
[01:56:45.337 --> 01:56:50.283]  And then, Alex, I'm afraid I, uh, you know, at least one or two of those, uh,
[01:56:51.508 --> 01:56:57.551]  You know, perhaps it is, we're taken out and assassinated at Canary Wharf is the most plausible explanation.
[01:56:57.952 --> 01:57:08.717]  I certainly don't believe they were on the trains, and the military style explosives on the train, a far more plausible explanation than the...
[01:57:10.018 --> 01:57:13.259]  So there's so many things wrong with it.
[01:57:38.829 --> 01:57:52.958]  I think we look at the G8 Summit on the day of Glen Eagles and what on earth was Tony Blair doing a few hours later coming on record when the police had announced that we don't know who's done this yet, but Tony Blair does.
[01:57:53.259 --> 01:57:55.320]  He knows this is being done in the name of Islam.
[01:57:56.338 --> 01:57:58.801]  No, I think that is a disgrace.
[01:57:58.961 --> 01:58:00.322]  I think that is unacceptable.
[01:58:01.183 --> 01:58:05.647]  But I wish good people in the UK would actually see it, because I think they're blind.
[01:58:05.807 --> 01:58:06.668]  Well, it gets worse.
[01:58:07.128 --> 01:58:18.599]  At the Tavistock Institute bus bombing, it turns out there were people with fake bandages on who were seen before, and then after with them off, you know, covering their whole faces, being bandaged up.
[01:58:19.379 --> 01:58:20.521]  I mean, this was off the charts.
[01:58:22.502 --> 01:58:26.106]  Insane and openly, openly staged.
[01:58:26.126 --> 01:58:32.111]  And the reason they had to admit they were doing drills is because people who were part of the drill then start questioning what happened.
[01:58:32.131 --> 01:58:36.395]  But by seeing an authority figure admit the drill, then they think it's all out in the open.
[01:58:36.415 --> 01:58:38.957]  That's why Larry Silverstein admits they blew up Building 7.
[01:58:39.177 --> 01:58:39.958]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:42.980 --> 01:58:44.742]  You are listening to GCN.

[02:00:12.464 --> 02:00:13.366]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.006 --> 02:00:17.672]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.213 --> 02:00:22.278]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.065 --> 02:00:30.649]  Well, we got Matthew Medina and Cody Hess, great political activists with a lot of news joining us coming up the next segment.
[02:00:31.129 --> 02:00:34.791]  They've also brought a friend along, Miss French.
[02:00:35.371 --> 02:00:38.953]  But we're going to be talking more in the future with Tony Farrell.
[02:00:38.973 --> 02:00:40.214]  He's got a website going up soon.
[02:00:40.234 --> 02:00:44.076]  He's going to be publishing stuff as like, you know, an open source analyst for the people.
[02:00:44.736 --> 02:00:48.580]  We also need to support him in what he's doing there in Airstrip One.
[02:00:49.300 --> 02:00:56.447]  Tony, you were making the point during the break to myself, you've been out for a week now, or five, six days, and no mainstream media in England.
[02:00:56.507 --> 02:01:06.917]  You would think this would be newsworthy, that a head analyst at a police department, a guy who was an analyst for the central government, the Home Office, comes out with this, and that they're staying quiet.
[02:01:06.977 --> 02:01:08.499]  They don't want folks to look into this.
[02:01:11.036 --> 02:01:20.440]  On a lot of truth websites all over the world, in a remarkably short space of time, following the interview I did on richpanic.com.
[02:01:21.381 --> 02:01:25.723]  And I'd point out, Alex, that people don't have to take my word for it.
[02:01:26.283 --> 02:01:30.265]  They can Google, they can search the web, and there's some fantastic analysis.
[02:01:30.765 --> 02:01:32.966]  The big picture 7-7, the ripple effect.
[02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:35.261]  See the deconstruction.
[02:01:35.681 --> 02:01:40.086]  All these documentaries are so superior to the government version.
[02:01:40.686 --> 02:01:42.528]  And people need to make their own mind up.
[02:01:42.608 --> 02:01:43.729]  They need to start looking.
[02:01:44.290 --> 02:01:49.695]  Because there's got to be compelling evidence that makes the government version ludicrous.
[02:01:50.076 --> 02:01:54.880]  We've had a recent inquiry, Alex, as you know, to look at intelligence failures.
[02:01:54.920 --> 02:01:55.901]  Lady Justice Hallett.
[02:01:56.722 --> 02:02:12.470]  And don't take my analysis, I've not gone into too much detail on that, but there's a chap called Nick Collistrum who stayed every day at the inquiry and has done detailed analysis that completely discredits the whole of that inquiry.
[02:02:13.291 --> 02:02:19.874]  And that needs to be seen and needs to be heard because that inquiry never allowed any searching questions to be asked.
[02:02:20.395 --> 02:02:20.815]  Why not?
[02:02:21.685 --> 02:02:28.731]  And there's counter-narratives, there's analysis that ruins the inquiry's verdict.
[02:02:29.292 --> 02:02:33.875]  And if that's the case, we've got corruption in the court too, I'm afraid.
[02:02:34.316 --> 02:02:39.300]  And certain witnesses aren't being allowed to call, so it's all biased.
[02:02:39.921 --> 02:02:40.961]  So, where do you go?
[02:02:41.081 --> 02:02:43.582]  We've got to get a breakthrough to mainstream media.
[02:02:43.943 --> 02:02:49.465]  We've got to get the public alerted, because I'm afraid, Alex, it's a bit like you say it is in America.
[02:02:49.925 --> 02:02:54.767]  People are just blind to it, and they turn a blind eye, and they're cowardly, and they need to wake up.
[02:02:55.867 --> 02:02:59.669]  It's hard as it may seem, but we can't keep silent any longer.
[02:02:59.689 --> 02:03:05.431]  And we need to put pressure, through my court case, we can put pressure on one police force.
[02:03:06.420 --> 02:03:12.189]  You know, we can, the court, this is potentially one means to really put pressure on the government.
[02:03:12.569 --> 02:03:17.878]  So I think, Alex, there's going to be a truth movement behind the progression of my court case.
[02:03:20.124 --> 02:03:20.965]  And that might help.
[02:03:21.886 --> 02:03:27.932]  It might help put exit pressure on, because certainly 9-11 and 7-7 will be discussed in the court.
[02:03:28.312 --> 02:03:37.341]  At the pre-hearing review we touched on 9-11, and my beliefs on 9-11 are similar to yours, but the judge thought they were absurd.
[02:03:37.361 --> 02:03:39.603]  And he's on record as saying that.
[02:03:40.024 --> 02:03:42.386]  So we've got absurd beliefs, Alex.
[02:03:44.958 --> 02:03:51.766]  We've got the real beliefs, I believe, the gist of it, so that needs to be in the public domain and we need to get the people to look at it.
[02:03:52.671 --> 02:04:01.495]  All right, well, Tony Farrell, we just appreciate your courage and the fact that, you know, you could have just gone along with the official story and not lost your job.
[02:04:01.995 --> 02:04:13.479]  You've done a lot more than most people would ever even think about doing, and it's going to be men and women of conscience who do stand up and at least have the courage to speak out against the lies that are going to turn the tide against this evil.
[02:04:13.519 --> 02:04:19.622]  I mean, all the lies about WMDs, the fake intelligence, the other staged terror attacks that have been declassified.
[02:04:20.763 --> 02:04:30.712]  If you've got groups that have done this before, and they have the motive, and they stand to gain, and only they can carry it out, and a SWAT, the supposed head of the bombings, it turns out is MI6.
[02:04:30.912 --> 02:04:34.075]  I mean, even Fox News and Associated Press have covered that.
[02:04:35.076 --> 02:04:41.101]  This stuff comes out, and then nothing's ever done, and then you and analysts go, look at all this information, and they say, you're fired!
[02:04:42.763 --> 02:04:43.844]  I mean, it's incredible.
[02:04:45.219 --> 02:04:47.061]  Mr. Farrell, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:04:47.081 --> 02:04:48.622]  We look forward to talking to you again in the future.
[02:04:48.843 --> 02:04:53.947]  We'll have you back as a criminologist to really walk through all of this, not just your case, in the near future.
[02:04:53.987 --> 02:04:54.468]  Godspeed.
[02:04:54.488 --> 02:04:55.589]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:04:55.769 --> 02:04:56.130]  God bless.
[02:04:56.330 --> 02:04:56.850]  Thank you, sir.
[02:04:57.090 --> 02:04:58.872]  We've got guests coming in studio, coming up.
[02:04:58.892 --> 02:04:59.313]  Stay with us.
[02:05:01.789 --> 02:05:07.192]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:05:08.433 --> 02:05:13.196]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:05:13.576 --> 02:05:20.620]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:05:22.301 --> 02:05:24.603]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:05:26.364 --> 02:05:28.745]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:05:30.803 --> 02:05:34.665]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[02:05:35.385 --> 02:05:38.487]  Blue diamond gussets, got it.
[02:05:39.227 --> 02:05:40.028]  Others don't.
[02:05:40.448 --> 02:05:42.349]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:05:42.609 --> 02:05:44.110]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[02:05:44.390 --> 02:05:46.951]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:05:47.271 --> 02:05:53.535]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:05:53.895 --> 02:05:56.116]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:05:56.596 --> 02:05:58.637]  Diamond gusset jeans, got it.
[02:05:58.977 --> 02:05:59.838]  Others don't.
[02:06:00.967 --> 02:06:05.210]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:06:05.510 --> 02:06:05.790]  Number 1.
[02:06:06.430 --> 02:06:09.592]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:06:09.853 --> 02:06:10.413]  Number 2.
[02:06:10.713 --> 02:06:15.256]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:06:15.596 --> 02:06:16.057]  It's true.
[02:06:16.357 --> 02:06:20.900]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:06:21.220 --> 02:06:21.760]  Number 3.
[02:06:22.040 --> 02:06:25.342]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:06:25.643 --> 02:06:29.325]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:06:29.525 --> 02:06:30.086]  Number 4.
[02:06:30.326 --> 02:06:32.689]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:06:33.089 --> 02:06:36.473]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:06:36.773 --> 02:06:36.993]  Number 5.
[02:06:37.574 --> 02:06:41.498]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:06:41.719 --> 02:06:46.484]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:06:46.764 --> 02:06:50.789]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:06:50.929 --> 02:06:52.491]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:06:52.711 --> 02:06:54.793]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:06:54.974 --> 02:06:57.316]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:07:01.701 --> 02:07:16.168]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[02:07:17.169 --> 02:07:20.851]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:21.860 --> 02:07:33.873]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:07:34.634 --> 02:07:41.902]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[02:07:42.583 --> 02:07:52.166]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[02:07:52.946 --> 02:07:56.227]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[02:07:56.867 --> 02:08:00.068]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[02:08:01.808 --> 02:08:07.350]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:20.232 --> 02:08:28.821]  Well, I guess now for a few years I have known Matthew Medina and I've seen the videos online with Cody Hess.
[02:08:29.281 --> 02:08:31.784]  They're great activists and they're also radio talk show hosts.
[02:08:31.844 --> 02:08:32.805]  I can hear them here locally.
[02:08:33.866 --> 02:08:36.408]  In Austin on 90.1 weeknights.
[02:08:36.768 --> 02:08:42.752]  And I just really enjoy listening to their show when I'm driving home later in the evening and tuning into it.
[02:08:42.792 --> 02:08:45.914]  So I thought, why not have Matthew Medina and Cody Hess in studio?
[02:08:45.974 --> 02:08:50.758]  And they brought another We Are Change activist, Rachel French, along with them.
[02:08:50.778 --> 02:08:52.859]  And they're going to be with us for the rest of the hour.
[02:08:52.879 --> 02:09:00.064]  We'll have to get some headphones on towards the end because I am going to take some calls from 9-11 truthers out there or folks that disagree with us.
[02:09:00.104 --> 02:09:02.405]  But we're going to see a lot of attacks.
[02:09:03.619 --> 02:09:04.379]  I don't think so.
[02:09:24.284 --> 02:09:25.645]  That's called dictatorship.
[02:09:26.005 --> 02:09:29.148]  I don't have a law, but I'm the decider, so that's the way it is.
[02:09:29.168 --> 02:09:40.857]  And we've had this slide towards tyranny, but now you've got Mitch McConnell yesterday saying, we'll just give Obama the power of the purse, violates Article 1, Section 8, to another extent, Section 7, Article 1, Section 7.
[02:09:41.978 --> 02:09:48.843]  This is all happening right now, and coming up later we've got Ron Paul grilling the head bankster, Ben Bernanke, and
[02:09:50.224 --> 02:09:52.046]  Bernanke tells Paul, gold is not money.
[02:09:52.106 --> 02:09:53.247]  Our fiat money is money.
[02:09:53.267 --> 02:09:58.851]  And they're going into QE3 now, like Mexico did back in the 80s, devaluing the dollar.
[02:10:00.352 --> 02:10:04.915]  The pesos soon will be on par with the dollar, to give people an idea, or I guess with the old ruble.
[02:10:04.935 --> 02:10:07.777]  But they're telling us there's no inflation.
[02:10:07.797 --> 02:10:08.598]  It's very low.
[02:10:09.018 --> 02:10:09.779]  Everything's fine.
[02:10:10.539 --> 02:10:13.722]  But more and more, they're having to admit, no, we're actually in a depression.
[02:10:14.082 --> 02:10:15.303]  So a lot is happening.
[02:10:15.864 --> 02:10:17.925]  And I mean, I don't know where to start with you guys.
[02:10:18.286 --> 02:10:20.207]  You're doing a great job down in San Antonio.
[02:10:20.828 --> 02:10:28.534]  And there's other people spontaneously all over the country confronting politicians with real questions, involved in activist actions.
[02:10:29.295 --> 02:10:33.758]  But Matthew, Cody, and of course, she didn't really want to be interviewed, but we drug her in here.
[02:10:34.339 --> 02:10:37.982]  Rachel, I mean, just what do you think is most important happening in the world right now?
[02:10:38.720 --> 02:10:38.840]  It's
[02:10:55.448 --> 02:11:00.612]  Uh, revolutions and of course they're staged and we can see all this, but here's something genuine in the Infowar activism.
[02:11:00.973 --> 02:11:03.195]  We want to highlight that because that's what we've been doing.
[02:11:03.215 --> 02:11:05.416]  That's what I've been doing for four years now in San Antonio.
[02:11:05.436 --> 02:11:13.603]  As you know, cause I've seen you a lot, you know, around here in Texas doing, doing activism and it's been nonstop and definitely so much going on in the road like you just brought up.
[02:11:13.643 --> 02:11:20.589]  But I mean, uh, specifically the Operation Gun Runner, um, uh, Fast and the Furious, we've planned two street actions for this month.
[02:11:21.269 --> 02:11:40.868]  Um, uh, one of our friends Henry Havik from We Are Change San Antonio made this sweet little box and it opens up what is Fast and the Furious opens up and we're going to put the articles and a flyer and everything and it's like a presentation and we we intro them to the false flag of this whole ATF letting the guns walk and we're custom making DVDs that we're going to hand out so there's two actions we're going to do on that topic this month.
[02:11:41.448 --> 02:11:51.452]  And I should also add, you guys make videos of the actions that have been seen by millions of people, and this is an example of how the alternative media is becoming the mainstream media.
[02:11:51.512 --> 02:11:58.495]  But getting into Fast and Furious, now it's coming out that the government actually shipped them and delivered them to Los Zetas.
[02:11:58.515 --> 02:12:01.677]  Well, Sully Costillo told us that six years ago, and again five years ago.
[02:12:01.697 --> 02:12:02.377]  And they locked him up.
[02:12:02.677 --> 02:12:03.738]  And they locked him up for it.
[02:12:04.318 --> 02:12:05.778]  I mean, their lives are finally eroding.
[02:12:05.858 --> 02:12:06.779]  It's starting to get like that.
[02:12:06.799 --> 02:12:11.580]  I mean, the more this stuff gets out there in the open and exposed, I mean, the more we have an opportunity to wake everybody up.
[02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:13.761]  And the people that have said we're kooks, they're the fools.
[02:12:14.001 --> 02:12:15.681]  Fifteen years ago, I had government documents.
[02:12:15.701 --> 02:12:17.662]  They knew that cell phones were causing brain cancer.
[02:12:17.902 --> 02:12:18.542]  Well, here it is.
[02:12:18.622 --> 02:12:19.782]  Fox News, CNN.
[02:12:20.082 --> 02:12:21.703]  Cell phones, cancer, infertility.
[02:12:21.723 --> 02:12:22.083]  100% fact.
[02:12:23.323 --> 02:12:23.563]  She?
[02:12:23.783 --> 02:12:25.944]  Yeah, yeah, just like they knew asbestos was bad.
[02:12:25.964 --> 02:12:30.325]  If you want to go old school, they know a lot of these things are bad for us and that's why it's our duty to expose them.
[02:12:30.365 --> 02:12:31.086]  Right now is the time.
[02:12:31.446 --> 02:12:32.406]  Everybody has information.
[02:12:32.426 --> 02:12:34.727]  We're seeing young people waking up when we do street actions.
[02:12:35.147 --> 02:12:38.488]  I mean the people that recognize us the most on the streets of San Antonio are teenagers.
[02:12:39.048 --> 02:12:47.174]  Watching our YouTube videos, so it's a good thing to, I mean that's a really positive thing, a bright thing for the future, so definitely encouraging all the listeners to take action.
[02:12:47.194 --> 02:12:49.515]  Yeah, the new generation is the way of the future.
[02:12:49.535 --> 02:12:54.318]  Like right here we got an article, Ron Paul, why the young flock to an old idealist.
[02:12:54.338 --> 02:12:58.982]  I mean they try to frame it like he's an old guy, it's old ideals, but really, I mean this guy's
[02:12:59.642 --> 02:13:01.423]  Putting everything that all young folk would like.
[02:13:01.483 --> 02:13:03.423]  I mean, all the young generation wants to be free.
[02:13:03.643 --> 02:13:05.004]  They don't want to live in this tyranny they see.
[02:13:05.044 --> 02:13:06.044]  And they see their future eroding.
[02:13:06.064 --> 02:13:06.564]  That's what I see.
[02:13:06.584 --> 02:13:07.125]  I mean, I'm young.
[02:13:07.485 --> 02:13:08.345]  I'm 21 years old.
[02:13:08.465 --> 02:13:10.066]  I see, like, 10 years from now.
[02:13:10.086 --> 02:13:11.226]  I mean, am I going to have a future?
[02:13:11.506 --> 02:13:12.246]  It doesn't look like it.
[02:13:12.427 --> 02:13:16.908]  Not if we let these criminals continue to blow stuff up and take our rights and pose as our savior.
[02:13:17.528 --> 02:13:19.249]  Rachel, how did you get woken up?
[02:13:20.189 --> 02:13:24.211]  Well, I started looking into videos just online, and I started kind of... Oh, over there.
[02:13:25.491 --> 02:13:25.791]  No, it's okay.
[02:13:25.811 --> 02:13:26.371]  They're moving it over.
[02:13:26.391 --> 02:13:27.452]  We need to hook a few more up in here.
[02:13:27.472 --> 02:13:27.712]  Go ahead.
[02:13:28.522 --> 02:13:42.695]  Um, basically, well, at first I didn't really want to believe a lot of the things that I was, you know, finding, and I kind of, like, looked the other way, but it gets to a point where you can't, because there's just so many facts, you know, that are just, like, right in front of your face.
[02:13:43.135 --> 02:13:54.245]  I think people just like to live, like, I don't know, in their own world, and, you know, not really acknowledge, like, what's going on, and that's, like, a source of frustration, I think, for all of us, because it's, like,
[02:13:54.994 --> 02:13:57.536]  We're trying to wake people up, and a lot of people, like, don't want to hear it.
[02:13:57.876 --> 02:14:00.978]  Well, yeah, I mean, if we've got killers running things, we better get them out of there.
[02:14:01.078 --> 02:14:01.778]  We're not safe.
[02:14:02.819 --> 02:14:03.739]  Gotta face reality.
[02:14:03.859 --> 02:14:07.041]  Yeah, it's definitely just a basic gut reaction to all this information.
[02:14:07.081 --> 02:14:08.302]  I mean, what are we supposed to do?
[02:14:08.402 --> 02:14:10.023]  Find out about all this and not do anything?
[02:14:10.043 --> 02:14:11.604]  We're just supposed to stay home and play video games?
[02:14:11.664 --> 02:14:13.405]  Are we not supposed to get fired up about this?
[02:14:13.666 --> 02:14:17.928]  Are we just supposed to get fired up about, what, uh, Xbox Live, PS3, watching some HD?
[02:14:18.208 --> 02:14:20.190]  I mean, come on, some serious stuff is going on.
[02:14:20.410 --> 02:14:22.331]  We need good people to stand up, stand for what's right.
[02:14:22.571 --> 02:14:23.992]  And yeah, a lot of people put up a fake
[02:14:24.352 --> 02:14:26.753]  Front that they don't want to hear this because they're faking it themselves.
[02:14:26.773 --> 02:14:31.075]  They're not at inner peace and ready and willing to stand up for those around to stand for what's good.
[02:14:31.095 --> 02:14:32.095]  And that's what we're trying to do.
[02:14:32.395 --> 02:14:38.298]  We are Change San Antonio, Truth Exposed Radio, and we're encouraging and highlighting all the other people feeling the same way as us.
[02:14:38.318 --> 02:14:45.641]  The guys in Dallas, the Health and Light guys who, uh, I know they got in the top ten of the V for Victory video where they just plastered posters everywhere.
[02:14:45.661 --> 02:14:47.321]  They just made the Global Leaks video.
[02:14:47.341 --> 02:14:51.163]  They had two videos that were just on the front of Infowars recently in the last week.
[02:14:51.383 --> 02:14:52.084]  They're awesome.
[02:14:52.104 --> 02:14:53.865]  They got passion.
[02:14:53.905 --> 02:14:54.946]  We got passion.
[02:14:55.026 --> 02:14:57.208]  And listen, they can't kill or lock us all up.
[02:14:57.408 --> 02:14:59.149]  And it's growing exponentially.
[02:14:59.529 --> 02:15:00.350]  Take Luke Rodowski.
[02:15:00.370 --> 02:15:03.713]  They kicked him out of 9-11 Truth because it was pretty much controlled in New York to a certain extent.
[02:15:04.213 --> 02:15:06.315]  I put him on air and said, folks, follow this example.
[02:15:06.955 --> 02:15:08.736]  The cops tried to say he had bombs.
[02:15:08.776 --> 02:15:09.837]  Turned out that was fake.
[02:15:10.378 --> 02:15:11.559]  It totally exploded.
[02:15:11.859 --> 02:15:13.340]  And then he was an example to others.
[02:15:13.380 --> 02:15:14.561]  Now you're an example to others.
[02:15:14.901 --> 02:15:16.042]  It's a chain reaction.
[02:15:16.062 --> 02:15:18.064]  What do you make of Bob Graham coming out on MSNBC?
[02:15:18.564 --> 02:15:20.666]  One of the top 9-11 commissioners is saying the U.S.
[02:15:20.686 --> 02:15:22.808]  government did protect the hijackers.
[02:15:23.568 --> 02:15:30.274]  They're finally having to come out with their lies because, I mean, 9-11 truth is growing so much to where now they're going to have to say, yeah, it is that way, but...
[02:15:31.337 --> 02:15:32.258]  No, what are you guys going to do about it?
[02:15:32.278 --> 02:15:34.439]  Well, their new hoax is 9-11 Truth Dead.
[02:15:34.459 --> 02:15:34.960]  Are you kidding?
[02:15:35.160 --> 02:15:35.400]  Yeah.
[02:15:35.540 --> 02:15:36.881]  It's on fire everywhere.
[02:15:37.601 --> 02:15:41.004]  Nine years ago, most of the radio stations kicked me off because of 9-11 Truth.
[02:15:41.044 --> 02:15:43.045]  Now they're putting me on because of it.
[02:15:44.066 --> 02:15:50.150]  It's totally mainline now, so the BBC's running this hoax that, oh, 9-11 Truth's dead.
[02:15:50.510 --> 02:15:51.211]  Yeah, folks.
[02:15:51.471 --> 02:15:52.391]  It's a war tactic.
[02:15:52.812 --> 02:15:54.593]  A war tactic to get all of us is to be like,
[02:15:55.013 --> 02:15:55.754]  You've lost.
[02:15:55.814 --> 02:15:56.775]  The war is over.
[02:15:57.155 --> 02:15:57.775]  Go home.
[02:15:58.636 --> 02:16:01.799]  It's also saying cease fire and then they fire all their weapons.
[02:16:01.959 --> 02:16:07.143]  Because everyone is already so frustrated like she was saying that people just won't accept the knowledge.
[02:16:07.163 --> 02:16:07.723]  They won't wake up.
[02:16:07.763 --> 02:16:10.886]  So you can get frustrated because it's like you see all this going on but people around you
[02:16:11.266 --> 02:16:15.050]  They won't wake up to it, and even if they do wake up to it, they won't get active with it.
[02:16:15.090 --> 02:16:16.552]  And I think that's all that really matters.
[02:16:16.572 --> 02:16:18.715]  I mean, just knowing the knowledge isn't enough now.
[02:16:19.135 --> 02:16:20.076]  I mean, that time has passed.
[02:16:20.136 --> 02:16:25.943]  Now we're at the precipice in history where we really have to make a choice, get active, or sit back and say, oh, they'll do it.
[02:16:26.203 --> 02:16:26.884]  Here's an example.
[02:16:26.964 --> 02:16:29.527]  I've got several million people that listen to this show every day.
[02:16:29.968 --> 02:16:33.152]  What would happen if all of them started putting out a neighborhood newsletter?
[02:16:33.172 --> 02:16:41.742]  What would happen if all of them got a, even if you don't understand the technology, I didn't understand the technology years ago, get your neighbor to help you do YouTube videos.
[02:16:42.683 --> 02:16:43.023]  Every day.
[02:16:43.063 --> 02:16:43.944]  It's very easy.
[02:16:44.244 --> 02:16:46.046]  What if everybody started talking?
[02:16:46.526 --> 02:16:47.827]  Everybody will reach people.
[02:16:47.927 --> 02:16:49.188]  Everybody will have a good effect.
[02:16:49.328 --> 02:16:53.111]  Some people are going to be more talented, more intelligent than I am or you are.
[02:16:53.372 --> 02:16:57.295]  We're going to find future Alex Joneses, future Luke Radowskis.
[02:16:57.315 --> 02:17:00.317]  We're going to find future Rachel Frenches.
[02:17:00.337 --> 02:17:02.519]  We're going to find future Cody Hesses.
[02:17:02.779 --> 02:17:04.760]  We're going to find future Ron Pauls.
[02:17:04.821 --> 02:17:09.925]  It's time to turn it loose, just like they have the farming teams for baseball.
[02:17:10.265 --> 02:17:11.606]  It is time to turn it on.
[02:17:11.846 --> 02:17:14.388]  Yeah, and you're right, and the spirit of the sports analogy is perfect.
[02:17:14.428 --> 02:17:19.332]  I would say Truth Exposed Radio is the sports center of the new wave of anti-New World Order activists.
[02:17:19.352 --> 02:17:22.495]  I mean, you have Matias and Pedro in Chile who confronted David Rockefeller.
[02:17:22.535 --> 02:17:23.236]  You have them all on!
[02:17:23.576 --> 02:17:32.744]  That's the show I heard last week, where you had like 20 different activists on from all over the world that many of them are making national news by slamming and bamming.
[02:17:32.944 --> 02:17:40.728]  Right now, Matias and Pedro in Chile, they just released a classified document from a business, a $7 billion U.S.
[02:17:40.768 --> 02:17:45.131]  plan to build this energy line, and 70% of the people are against it.
[02:17:45.431 --> 02:17:53.635]  Well, the document's released to Matias, and he leaked them out, and now the publications in Chile are saying his website is the WikiLeaks of Chile.
[02:17:53.675 --> 02:17:54.596]  This just happened yesterday.
[02:17:54.636 --> 02:17:55.276]  They sent it to me.
[02:17:55.316 --> 02:17:56.137]  And these guys are young.
[02:17:56.317 --> 02:17:57.057]  I mean, they're— Listen!
[02:17:57.397 --> 02:17:58.218]  History's here!
[02:17:59.158 --> 02:18:03.201]  Listen, down the road, you're gonna wish you got in the fight for 1776.
[02:18:04.683 --> 02:18:09.406]  1776, worldwide, it's time to just get some on the New World Order!
[02:18:13.698 --> 02:18:17.122]  Don't wait until 20 years when it's all, oh it's cool now.
[02:18:17.162 --> 02:18:18.984]  No, jump on it now before it's cool.
[02:18:19.004 --> 02:18:19.705]  We're doing it now.
[02:18:19.745 --> 02:18:22.768]  Matias and Pedro in Chile, over here in the U.S.
[02:18:22.888 --> 02:18:25.130]  And now more people are going to send them documents.
[02:18:25.150 --> 02:18:26.552]  Yeah, more people.
[02:18:26.612 --> 02:18:28.914]  And they'll try to take over that, but more will be launched.
[02:18:29.235 --> 02:18:31.737]  I mean, we need to launch a thousand X-Wings at this Death Star.
[02:18:32.358 --> 02:18:36.322]  Throwing info nuggets in the pond of consciousness of the minds of men is what we're doing.
[02:18:36.342 --> 02:18:37.483]  We're just launching DVDs.
[02:18:37.503 --> 02:18:38.384]  We found out well over 30,000.
[02:18:38.444 --> 02:18:39.705]  That's what I've always said.
[02:18:39.765 --> 02:18:41.767]  Don't stop, just fire in all directions.
[02:18:41.807 --> 02:18:42.868]  I'm not stopping.
[02:18:42.908 --> 02:18:47.232]  If you hand out 100 DVDs and it gets to one person to watch it, I mean, that's, you already woke up a mind.
[02:18:47.272 --> 02:18:48.093]  I mean, that's all that matters.
[02:18:48.133 --> 02:18:51.336]  I would spend 20 bucks to get 100 DVDs to wake up one person.
[02:18:51.476 --> 02:18:56.679]  And that's how we've been surviving is the fact that people, it's like a family network and we are Change San Antonio.
[02:18:56.980 --> 02:19:00.722]  Different people always pitching in DVDs so we can keep going and keep going and we keep making videos.
[02:19:01.022 --> 02:19:04.285]  And for example, our camcorder died last year and we haven't had a camcorder.
[02:19:04.305 --> 02:19:05.385]  We've been using our iPhones.
[02:19:05.926 --> 02:19:07.887]  So the point is, you do what you can.
[02:19:07.907 --> 02:19:08.788]  I'll give you one right now.
[02:19:08.848 --> 02:19:13.691]  I've got piles of old cameras that aren't compatible with our new computers.
[02:19:13.751 --> 02:19:14.631]  Last year we didn't stop.
[02:19:14.651 --> 02:19:17.133]  We kept making videos with what we have and that's what we try to tell everybody.
[02:19:17.173 --> 02:19:18.634]  Just do what you can with what you have.
[02:19:18.934 --> 02:19:19.675]  Don't stress out about it.
[02:19:19.695 --> 02:19:21.296]  But now you've gotten into some cameras that you're saying.
[02:19:21.896 --> 02:19:22.136]  No.
[02:19:22.156 --> 02:19:24.998]  We're going to give you some right now then.
[02:19:25.218 --> 02:19:29.220]  The videos are just as important as the action because the videos show an example of how to get active.
[02:19:29.260 --> 02:19:30.060]  It shows that it's easy.
[02:19:30.080 --> 02:19:31.241]  I mean, we go out there, we have a good time.
[02:19:31.281 --> 02:19:33.182]  We're not out there like, oh, we got to do this.
[02:19:33.202 --> 02:19:34.202]  We're like, hey, let's have fun with it.
[02:19:34.222 --> 02:19:35.463]  We go out, we get active.
[02:19:35.483 --> 02:19:38.864]  Listen, I got some AK-47s for you in the info war.
[02:19:38.964 --> 02:19:41.706]  I've got a bunch of cameras we really can't use.
[02:19:41.726 --> 02:19:43.207]  They're not compatible with the latest computers.
[02:19:43.487 --> 02:19:45.588]  So we're going to get you some more weapons.
[02:19:45.608 --> 02:19:46.168]  That's awesome.
[02:19:46.328 --> 02:19:47.249]  But I mean, exactly.
[02:19:47.449 --> 02:19:49.590]  All over the place, people are having a huge effect.
[02:19:49.610 --> 02:19:49.971]  Stay there.
[02:19:49.991 --> 02:19:55.615]  Let's talk about more of what's happening and see if we can't cause an info riot here today.
[02:19:55.755 --> 02:19:56.576]  I'm Alex Jones.

[02:21:01.475 --> 02:21:03.797]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:21:03.857 --> 02:21:06.078]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:21:06.178 --> 02:21:08.999]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:21:09.400 --> 02:21:14.142]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:21:14.483 --> 02:21:18.685]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:21:19.005 --> 02:21:21.328]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:21:21.348 --> 02:21:23.892]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:21:24.232 --> 02:21:26.815]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:21:27.156 --> 02:21:34.766]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:21:35.089 --> 02:21:40.351]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:21:40.471 --> 02:21:43.272]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:21:43.312 --> 02:21:46.753]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:21:47.013 --> 02:21:47.934]  And I got news for you.
[02:21:48.074 --> 02:21:49.374]  You're everyone else.

[02:22:00.936 --> 02:22:01.276]  Gold.
[02:22:01.537 --> 02:22:05.840]  If you listen to the radio, watch TV, or surf the net, you're hearing about gold.
[02:22:06.101 --> 02:22:08.663]  Eventually you will ask yourself, is gold right for me?
[02:22:08.923 --> 02:22:10.044]  The answer might surprise you.
[02:22:10.344 --> 02:22:12.746]  We protect ourselves and our families from many things.
[02:22:13.027 --> 02:22:14.107]  Do you have medical insurance?
[02:22:14.448 --> 02:22:15.188]  Is your home insured?
[02:22:15.208 --> 02:22:16.570]  Do you carry life insurance?
[02:22:16.810 --> 02:22:18.031]  How about financial insurance?
[02:22:18.351 --> 02:22:19.973]  If you own gold, then the answer is yes.
[02:22:20.333 --> 02:22:23.756]  If you don't own gold, the question is why don't you have financial insurance?
[02:22:24.016 --> 02:22:25.677]  We put our faith in things we trust.
[02:22:26.057 --> 02:22:26.977]  Do you trust the dollar?
[02:22:26.997 --> 02:22:28.277]  Do you trust the economy?
[02:22:28.458 --> 02:22:29.418]  Do you trust the government?
[02:22:29.698 --> 02:22:31.599]  Gold has always been something you can trust.
[02:22:31.879 --> 02:22:34.540]  For thousands of years, people have put their faith in gold.
[02:22:34.860 --> 02:22:36.000]  Where will you put your faith?
[02:22:36.240 --> 02:22:38.801]  Now is the time to protect yourself and your family.

[02:24:26.311 --> 02:24:31.377]  Political activists, who I didn't even know over the last year, have been shooting videos on their iPhones, but that works pretty darn good, actually.
[02:24:31.818 --> 02:24:37.906]  So, we've got some video cameras that we actually still use occasionally, but we always try to move up to the even higher res.
[02:24:38.566 --> 02:24:41.490]  One is an HD Sony hard drive.
[02:24:43.092 --> 02:24:43.933]  That I've had for years.
[02:24:43.973 --> 02:24:45.974]  I've done a lot of work with this little baby myself.
[02:24:46.334 --> 02:24:47.515]  I've had this five, six years.
[02:24:47.555 --> 02:24:50.217]  This has seen a lot, including Bilderberg Group, 2006.
[02:24:50.557 --> 02:24:53.219]  We're giving you both these with the firewires and the equipment.
[02:24:53.299 --> 02:25:08.409]  Two little terrorists in the Info War to go out there and show the evil that's going on, but also show the folks that you're waking up and the politicians like Twinkle Toes, Perry, the former chief of staff in Texas for Al Gore, God bless him.
[02:25:09.069 --> 02:25:11.091]  So you guys are just doing a wonderful job.
[02:25:11.611 --> 02:25:12.231]  Please continue.
[02:25:12.251 --> 02:25:12.912]  So you're down there in
[02:25:13.512 --> 02:25:21.875]  In San Antonio, Military City, USA, even when the newspaper tries to come photograph the giant NSA base, the police come and tell them to turn off their cameras in America.
[02:25:22.316 --> 02:25:23.416]  We've had that happen to us too.
[02:25:23.756 --> 02:25:27.778]  Our group, we are down there at NSA trying to get some video footage and they're coming at us.
[02:25:27.798 --> 02:25:28.898]  That's happened to you, that's happened to me.
[02:25:28.918 --> 02:25:36.041]  Yeah, that was one story I didn't really tell anybody because they actually did intimidate me to delete my footage and I was kind of, I kept, I mean the group of guys were like, man,
[02:25:37.400 --> 02:25:43.826]  Yeah, well, if they're off their jurisdiction at the Home Depot, you know, a quarter mile away, next they're going to be in your house.
[02:25:44.106 --> 02:25:48.330]  Yeah, and I mean, you know, that's why I want to encourage all activists, definitely know your rights.
[02:25:48.430 --> 02:25:50.532]  I mean, of course... I mean, we know what you're doing in there.
[02:25:50.712 --> 02:25:53.334]  You're running all our communications illegally through your computers.
[02:25:53.354 --> 02:25:54.055]  We know you're crooks.
[02:25:54.075 --> 02:25:55.136]  We know you staged 9-11.
[02:25:55.256 --> 02:25:57.198]  Oh yeah, I mean... And we know you know, terrorist!
[02:25:57.558 --> 02:25:59.740]  Yeah, and we tried to drop info bombs on them.
[02:25:59.780 --> 02:26:00.661]  I gave them DVDs.
[02:26:01.181 --> 02:26:06.906]  These are NSA police, and as soon as we got out of the street, we were going to hang posters for one of the videos across the street from the NSA.
[02:26:07.166 --> 02:26:08.427]  Right away, they came, pulled up, got out.
[02:26:08.708 --> 02:26:11.650]  They had police suits, and right away, they wanted to get our info.
[02:26:11.670 --> 02:26:12.951]  But basically, I gave them the DVDs.
[02:26:13.311 --> 02:26:18.176]  He got them, walked to the car, put them in a plastic bag, sealed it, and then put the plastic bag with the DVDs in the car.
[02:26:18.196 --> 02:26:18.476]  Evidence bags.
[02:26:19.036 --> 02:26:19.337]  Yeah.
[02:26:19.877 --> 02:26:21.138]  But, you know, that was about it.
[02:26:21.198 --> 02:26:22.139]  Yeah, well, don't worry.
[02:26:22.179 --> 02:26:23.240]  They're civil.
[02:26:23.280 --> 02:26:25.121]  Edmunds heard them commanding Al-Qaeda, so...
[02:26:25.902 --> 02:26:28.643]  I mean, of course they don't want you filming them, they carried out 9-11!
[02:26:28.663 --> 02:26:30.804]  These are terrorists!
[02:26:31.024 --> 02:26:35.006]  You know, Wayne Madsen exposed the Q Unit and the NSA covering up 9-11.
[02:26:35.046 --> 02:26:40.789]  They are covering it up, and they're definitely got a big presence in San Antonio, as well as a lot of military bases.
[02:26:40.809 --> 02:26:46.071]  And these are the people that we're trying to wake up when we do street actions in front of the Alamo, just all around San Antonio.
[02:26:46.331 --> 02:26:48.092]  Putting up posters, we're going to do that this Saturday.
[02:26:48.372 --> 02:26:50.733]  We're going to go put up Ron Paul 2012 posters everywhere.
[02:26:51.073 --> 02:26:53.757]  Am I gonna make a video with these little babies right here?
[02:26:53.777 --> 02:26:58.463]  These little exclusive limited edition Alex Jones Build-A-Bird camcorder, what?
[02:26:59.454 --> 02:27:01.896]  That's a baby Elkada right there.
[02:27:02.156 --> 02:27:02.596]  Yeah.
[02:27:03.037 --> 02:27:05.298]  So yeah, we're definitely going to be on the streets this month.
[02:27:05.599 --> 02:27:07.260]  Three street actions we've got this month.
[02:27:07.800 --> 02:27:08.340]  Hopefully more.
[02:27:08.361 --> 02:27:09.661]  We're going to stop.
[02:27:09.681 --> 02:27:10.142]  That's one thing.
[02:27:10.182 --> 02:27:11.143]  We're not going to stop this.
[02:27:11.183 --> 02:27:14.585]  I mean, they can try to make us feel all down, like we can't make a change.
[02:27:14.645 --> 02:27:15.266]  We know we can.
[02:27:15.286 --> 02:27:18.148]  Because we've seen, I mean, how many more people are tuning in to your show every day?
[02:27:18.508 --> 02:27:21.770]  How many more people are, you know, liking our page on Facebook that we have that are like, yo, yo.
[02:27:21.790 --> 02:27:23.792]  Yeah, tell us about your terrorist websites.
[02:27:24.232 --> 02:27:27.653]  Well, we have TruthExposedRadio.com is our radio website.
[02:27:27.693 --> 02:27:31.274]  We actually just put up a new website which is NewWorldActivist.com.
[02:27:31.294 --> 02:27:32.114]  That's a new site we're working on.
[02:27:32.134 --> 02:27:33.975]  It's going to be like an alternative media website.
[02:27:34.735 --> 02:27:37.636]  What we're really trying to do is pull the whole community of everyone that gets active.
[02:27:37.696 --> 02:27:38.296]  All the subcultures.
[02:27:38.316 --> 02:27:39.036]  You know, from Chile.
[02:27:39.056 --> 02:27:39.936]  The guys down there in Chile.
[02:27:39.956 --> 02:27:42.317]  By the way, it's Rachel French, not French.
[02:27:42.357 --> 02:27:43.017]  They brought her along.
[02:27:43.057 --> 02:27:44.858]  I just met her and thought I'd drag her in here.
[02:27:44.878 --> 02:27:45.698]  What do you think of all this?
[02:27:46.678 --> 02:27:52.425]  Um, basically, uh, yeah, we just try to do what we can to, uh, you know, get the information out there.
[02:27:52.906 --> 02:27:57.251]  It's a lot of fun, and we have a great team, and everybody is like a family, like he said.
[02:27:57.331 --> 02:28:00.075]  So, yeah, we're definitely trying to plan more.
[02:28:00.779 --> 02:28:02.681]  Well, it's exciting to get out and talk to people.
[02:28:02.701 --> 02:28:03.781]  You know, take San Antonio.
[02:28:03.821 --> 02:28:10.307]  More and more they try to have Air Force police and others out policing citizens in the middle of San Antonio.
[02:28:10.847 --> 02:28:13.309]  And I know some folks down in San Antonio have exposed that as well.
[02:28:13.649 --> 02:28:16.632]  I mean, we've got to get in their face or they're going to get in our face.
[02:28:17.052 --> 02:28:20.375]  I mean, here's CPS is to start taking people's fat children.
[02:28:20.915 --> 02:28:22.837]  Next, it'll be if your children are one pound overweight.
[02:28:22.857 --> 02:28:24.198]  They're trying that in Arkansas.
[02:28:24.558 --> 02:28:26.100]  These people aren't going to stop.
[02:28:26.140 --> 02:28:27.401]  We've got to teach government.
[02:28:27.661 --> 02:28:28.562]  They work for us.
[02:28:29.282 --> 02:28:31.004]  Yeah, because if you don't, they're going to keep pushing it.
[02:28:31.404 --> 02:28:37.770]  And I know you saw the news article with the video cameras in the kitchens of the cafeterias of schools and elementaries.
[02:28:37.830 --> 02:28:39.051]  Yeah, the Pentagon runs that.
[02:28:39.111 --> 02:28:40.852]  Well, what's wrong with the Pentagon watching children?
[02:28:41.312 --> 02:28:42.794]  Are you against America?
[02:28:43.694 --> 02:28:44.875]  Are you against the troops?
[02:28:45.296 --> 02:28:48.398]  Are you against the troops being used as guinea pigs with experimental shots?
[02:28:48.759 --> 02:28:50.860]  Are you against the troops drinking bisphenol A?
[02:28:51.060 --> 02:28:54.363]  Look, troops, police, you're all being murdered by the globalists as well.
[02:28:54.623 --> 02:28:58.567]  Time to grow up and realize our country's been hijacked by a scientific dictatorship.
[02:28:59.247 --> 02:28:59.567]  Okay?
[02:28:59.648 --> 02:29:00.288]  Grow up!
[02:29:00.609 --> 02:29:06.415]  Look at Fast and Furious, your terrorist masters shipping guns down there that have killed three Border Patrol agents.
[02:29:06.675 --> 02:29:07.576]  Are we Al Qaeda?
[02:29:07.776 --> 02:29:09.958]  Because we don't want to give guns to the cartels?
[02:29:10.459 --> 02:29:11.159]  I guess we are.
[02:29:11.219 --> 02:29:12.140]  Yeah, well that's all it's all about.
[02:29:12.160 --> 02:29:16.845]  I mean, everyone operates in this mainstream illusion that the whole system, I mean... America's good!
[02:29:17.146 --> 02:29:18.607]  America doesn't exist anymore!
[02:29:18.807 --> 02:29:20.309]  And only by admitting that will we get it back.
[02:29:20.469 --> 02:29:21.010]  Well, that's what we say.
[02:29:21.030 --> 02:29:27.776]  I mean, you know, you look at the mainstream illusion and you have, you know, your big talk show hosts like Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, you got, you know, Ed Schultz.
[02:29:27.816 --> 02:29:29.978]  All these guys, they talk about and they stay within the mainstream illusion.
[02:29:29.998 --> 02:29:31.540]  They talk about the 9% unemployment.
[02:29:31.580 --> 02:29:32.220]  We know the real unemployment.
[02:29:32.240 --> 02:29:33.882]  No, they're tossing a football back and forth.
[02:29:33.922 --> 02:29:35.844]  It's all, they prop each other up.
[02:29:35.964 --> 02:29:36.604]  It's a little illusion.
[02:29:36.644 --> 02:29:37.725]  It's a little game that they put up.
[02:29:37.765 --> 02:29:44.307]  It's like, you know, just creating this little fairytale world and for some reason you see the most mainstream media organizations, they operate within it.
[02:29:44.707 --> 02:29:51.449]  Meanwhile, the real folks running it are a bunch of murdering terrorists spiking your water with carcinogens and radioactive isotopes.
[02:29:51.609 --> 02:29:52.489]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.009 --> 02:29:54.610]  The Empire's on the run.

[02:30:28.008 --> 02:30:35.633]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:30:36.014 --> 02:30:40.937]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[02:31:09.137 --> 02:31:11.419]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:31:11.680 --> 02:31:16.884]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:31:17.064 --> 02:31:19.847]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:31:20.107 --> 02:31:22.169]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:31:22.409 --> 02:31:28.333]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:31:28.673 --> 02:31:31.855]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:31:32.035 --> 02:31:37.559]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:31:37.819 --> 02:31:39.140]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:31:39.460 --> 02:31:40.621]  I can't stress this enough.

[02:33:07.458 --> 02:33:11.040]  Even your emotions had an echo in so much space.
[02:33:32.069 --> 02:33:35.713]  That's right, I wasn't crazy, I just knew too much.
[02:33:35.733 --> 02:33:37.054]  Does that make me crazy?
[02:33:37.154 --> 02:33:40.078]  Does that make me crazy?
[02:33:42.031 --> 02:33:43.953]  Well, possibly, my friends.
[02:33:45.014 --> 02:33:47.017]  Wow, it's great having these folks in studio.
[02:33:47.097 --> 02:33:50.481]  It is going to be the young people, it's going to be the middle-aged folks, the old people.
[02:33:50.981 --> 02:33:54.746]  It's going to be human beings that stand up and face the facts.
[02:33:54.846 --> 02:33:57.249]  And the journey of a thousand miles does start with a single step.
[02:33:57.829 --> 02:34:02.314]  Go over when you're having a barbecue with your neighbors and they're wanting to tell you about LeBron James or...
[02:34:03.561 --> 02:34:05.823]  Whatever, you know, diversions going on.
[02:34:06.203 --> 02:34:08.345]  And say, yeah, that LeBron James, that's real interesting.
[02:34:09.025 --> 02:34:10.687]  What about dollar devaluation?
[02:34:10.787 --> 02:34:12.128]  What about all these new wars?
[02:34:12.168 --> 02:34:16.071]  What about the fact that the President's grabbing dictatorial power?
[02:34:17.694 --> 02:34:18.674]  What are we going to do about it?
[02:34:19.074 --> 02:34:24.175]  Or are we just people that sit here and watch television and live in this controlled paradigm?
[02:34:24.856 --> 02:34:28.516]  And going back to Cody Hess, Cody, you got cut off by the break.
[02:34:28.736 --> 02:34:35.218]  We're talking about this false reality and how people are literally in this trance, actually, technically, physically.
[02:34:35.618 --> 02:34:38.039]  I mean, I mean, that's admitted from watching television and the culture.
[02:34:38.599 --> 02:34:39.899]  And if we went to break, you got cut off.
[02:34:40.347 --> 02:34:42.149]  Yeah, it's just social engineering, basically.
[02:34:42.209 --> 02:34:47.234]  I mean, it's this false reality that for some reason, I mean, you have the majority of the public still living in it.
[02:34:47.254 --> 02:34:53.199]  I mean, when they say there's 9.2% unemployment, we all go, not us, obviously, but everyone goes, oh yeah, 9.2% unemployment.
[02:34:53.219 --> 02:34:54.461]  We already know it's way above that.
[02:34:54.481 --> 02:34:59.686]  I mean, we already know that this whole thing in Libya is a war, yet so many people operate within the mainstream illusion saying, yeah,
[02:35:00.286 --> 02:35:03.589]  It's not a war, it's just a kinetic military action.
[02:35:03.789 --> 02:35:05.851]  There's love bombs being dropped, you know, like you say.
[02:35:05.971 --> 02:35:08.253]  But everyone operates within it, and it's ridiculous.
[02:35:08.273 --> 02:35:14.719]  And we're always trying to expose the mainstream illusion because, I mean, the longer that the mainstream is guiding the world, we will be stuck in this.
[02:35:14.739 --> 02:35:21.085]  But the alternative media is on the rise, and we are seeing, like we have stuff right here, internet gains on television as public's main news source.
[02:35:21.105 --> 02:35:26.950]  We're always talking about it on our show because we're saying social networking is the way to spread news in the future, and that's why they're trying to go
[02:35:27.350 --> 02:35:29.473]  To make it illegal to embed YouTube clips?
[02:35:29.533 --> 02:35:33.217]  I mean, how many people watch cool little, you know... Well, YouTube sets it up for you to do that.
[02:35:33.277 --> 02:35:34.118]  People want you to.
[02:35:34.418 --> 02:35:37.121]  You can set your channel where you can't embed if you don't want.
[02:35:37.141 --> 02:35:42.127]  Yeah, but, I mean, they're gonna try to do whatever they can to stop this knowledge from flowing out, but they're not gonna stop this.
[02:35:42.307 --> 02:35:50.330]  Because right now, like, we have this headline, 43% of news sharing online is via social media, and that's how people listening can take action, just sharing information.
[02:35:50.370 --> 02:36:02.534]  Right here in the same article it says, the study found that 27% of frequent sharers, defined as those sharing at least six stories each week, were responsible for 87% of all news shared online.
[02:36:02.815 --> 02:36:03.835]  Keep sharing!
[02:36:03.915 --> 02:36:07.116]  Keep spreading the InfoWars.com links.
[02:36:07.156 --> 02:36:08.857]  We're kicking... by the way, our Facebook
[02:36:09.657 --> 02:36:11.858]  That gets about 300,000 visitors a day.
[02:36:11.878 --> 02:36:14.599]  That was just a fan Facebook they gave us.
[02:36:15.259 --> 02:36:20.781]  It was shut down yesterday and we, for no reason, let me see if our Facebook's still up again.
[02:36:20.801 --> 02:36:23.862]  Well, the great activists on Facebook that are... It's back, it's back.
[02:36:24.942 --> 02:36:27.503]  Listen, Google's been doing all sorts of squirrely stuff.
[02:36:28.163 --> 02:36:30.845]  Oh yeah, they're rolling out their social network, and they want control of this.
[02:36:30.925 --> 02:36:35.328]  I mean, they've definitely got their fingers up in everything, but positivity, definitely.
[02:36:35.408 --> 02:36:46.595]  Operation InfoJam the System is a movement going on Facebook, where people are just jamming the White House Facebook page, celebrity Facebook pages, pages to mainstream shows that get high millions of viewers.
[02:36:46.856 --> 02:36:55.001]  They're going to their Facebook pages and dropping Police Day 4, Invisible Empire, and Endgame, and they're dropping them in comments, and they're just taking over Facebook and just sharing all this information.
[02:36:55.021 --> 02:36:55.882]  Well, let me just say this.
[02:36:56.042 --> 02:36:57.142]  InfoJam the Mainstream.
[02:36:57.363 --> 02:36:58.003]  That's awesome.
[02:36:58.823 --> 02:37:17.931]  By the way, we did a Google bomb a few days ago and lately they've been failing unless I give a really archaic, and I forgot to do today's, we'll do it later in the week, but that was, the point is they admittedly changed their algorithm to try to block us and now they've got big indexes of popular terms.
[02:37:18.231 --> 02:37:20.652]  Can't criticize Google, can't criticize Obama.
[02:37:20.913 --> 02:37:25.114]  They admit they're changing their algorithm to block alternative news sites because they're desperate.
[02:37:25.134 --> 02:37:26.475]  It shows we're having an effect.
[02:37:26.795 --> 02:37:27.896]  Or they wouldn't be trying to block us?
[02:37:56.795 --> 02:37:57.916]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:37:58.156 --> 02:38:04.240]  I'm an electrician by day, not as eloquent as Clark Kent's Daily Planet reporter by day.
[02:38:04.300 --> 02:38:12.826]  But I talk to a lot of people on the job sites, and I was talking to some guys about the other day, and he's like, oh yeah, somebody else gave me some Alex Jones DVDs.
[02:38:12.846 --> 02:38:14.487]  And I was like, well, here, I got some for you in my tool bag.
[02:38:14.507 --> 02:38:14.748]  Boom.
[02:38:15.108 --> 02:38:17.169]  M4 War DVDs with the seven movies on it.
[02:38:17.309 --> 02:38:20.652]  Now, the power of people, and of course we've been doing that pre-show.
[02:38:21.252 --> 02:38:21.372]  Yeah.
[02:38:38.007 --> 02:38:39.087]  Yeah, that's what I was saying.
[02:38:39.107 --> 02:38:41.968]  I was like, I dare them to shut down the internet.
[02:38:42.029 --> 02:38:49.331]  I mean, that'll just get everybody out there on the streets, and they definitely don't want that, because that human-to-human interaction is way stronger than even the internet.
[02:39:05.077 --> 02:39:07.800]  Well, again, when I tell this story, I'm not bragging.
[02:39:08.100 --> 02:39:11.805]  In fact, it's the opposite because I don't like listening to my show.
[02:39:12.385 --> 02:39:14.107]  I don't really like a lot of my delivery.
[02:39:14.408 --> 02:39:16.870]  You know, sometimes I hear part of my show and go, that was really good.
[02:39:17.191 --> 02:39:17.892]  That was gold.
[02:39:18.152 --> 02:39:19.613]  But a lot of times, I do this a lot.
[02:39:20.434 --> 02:39:27.216]  I tend to do even better interviews when I'm on somebody else's show or when I'm at home with an iPhone because I'm in here for years.
[02:39:27.356 --> 02:39:31.297]  You know, in a way it almost psychologically becomes stale and oppressive.
[02:39:31.717 --> 02:39:32.657]  I don't like doing this.
[02:39:32.778 --> 02:39:34.678]  I have dreams about not doing this.
[02:39:34.718 --> 02:39:43.581]  I have dreams where I'm a forester or a doctor or an auto mechanic and in the dream I wake up and I'm not Alex Jones and I'm so happy.
[02:39:43.921 --> 02:39:46.621]  It's the opposite because of the great responsibility.
[02:39:46.661 --> 02:39:48.222]  But if I told people
[02:39:49.022 --> 02:39:51.883]  The type of phone calls I get, the famous people that call me.
[02:39:52.003 --> 02:39:53.503]  I mean, the biggest people there are.
[02:39:54.123 --> 02:39:57.344]  But in 99% of the cases, they don't want to come on the show.
[02:39:57.364 --> 02:40:02.725]  You know, in some cases they say, well, you can talk about me if you want and say that I support what you're doing.
[02:40:02.745 --> 02:40:03.605]  But then I don't even do that.
[02:40:03.925 --> 02:40:05.446]  They're not 100% in on it.
[02:40:06.306 --> 02:40:10.427]  But it's getting exponential, exponential, exponential.
[02:40:10.847 --> 02:40:16.728]  And I use that as a radar ping that all these famous people are calling me, showing that this isn't something that's trendy.
[02:40:17.168 --> 02:40:18.068]  It's an awakening.
[02:40:18.168 --> 02:40:18.808]  It's permanent.
[02:40:19.048 --> 02:40:22.949]  It's not like zoot suits are in, you know, in the 1950s or whatever.
[02:40:23.249 --> 02:40:26.590]  This is about reality and a renaissance of awakening.
[02:40:26.610 --> 02:40:27.670]  And again, I'm known.
[02:40:27.970 --> 02:40:30.871]  My ugly, fat, bulldog mug is known.
[02:40:31.211 --> 02:40:34.452]  And so I have something that other people who are activists don't.
[02:40:34.792 --> 02:40:37.072]  I actually get a chance to see how many people are awake.
[02:40:37.552 --> 02:40:44.694]  And it is incredible, exponentially, how many people come over to me, how many people shake my hand, no matter where I am in the world.
[02:40:45.894 --> 02:40:48.455]  Our numbers are much higher than the average person thinks.
[02:40:49.215 --> 02:40:53.916]  I definitely agree with that because I mean you see it all around us from art to music, culture.
[02:40:54.196 --> 02:40:56.776]  I mean everything's leaning towards exposing this information.
[02:40:56.796 --> 02:41:01.217]  I mean like the Illuminati influence in the mainstream industry, in the music industry.
[02:41:01.718 --> 02:41:02.738]  Everybody knows about that now.
[02:41:02.798 --> 02:41:08.339]  Even Sundance had to make a VH1 style TV show and Mark Dice was on there by Secret Societies and
[02:41:08.559 --> 02:41:09.239]  Oh, it's everywhere.
[02:41:09.720 --> 02:41:12.501]  Like the new Rush songs are about the new world order and corruption.
[02:41:12.782 --> 02:41:15.183]  I hear all these new rock and roll country songs.
[02:41:15.823 --> 02:41:19.185]  It's all about the corrupt, you know, fat cats and we got to wake up.
[02:41:19.245 --> 02:41:22.147]  And Muse, who are listeners of the show, it's everywhere.
[02:41:22.587 --> 02:41:23.288]  Yeah, it's everywhere.
[02:41:23.308 --> 02:41:24.188]  And we're helping it grow.
[02:41:24.248 --> 02:41:25.869]  I mean, we're sparking, sparking the fire.
[02:41:27.390 --> 02:41:32.393]  Info-jamming, taking action, making music, making art, and that's what we're trying to do.
[02:41:32.753 --> 02:41:34.414]  We're trying to create a website.
[02:41:34.454 --> 02:41:43.939]  We do have a website, newworldactivist.com, highlighting artists, musicians, and activists, and just get that going, just that subculture, the next generation, people using all means to get the information out.
[02:41:44.119 --> 02:41:46.960]  Because it is a new world, everything's changing, and we're doing something.
[02:41:46.980 --> 02:41:55.065]  And that's why the globalists, and they admit this in books they've written, try to hijack countercultures, or try to create false countercultures, because
[02:41:56.105 --> 02:41:58.989]  In 20-year cycles, it always becomes the culture.
[02:41:59.309 --> 02:42:07.479]  Well, this is a total awakening, true liberty, outside-the-box, outside-the-left-right paradigm system, and we are the future.
[02:42:07.820 --> 02:42:11.985]  And that's why the system's trying to come in with tyranny right now, because they know their time is short.
[02:42:12.165 --> 02:42:17.131]  Yeah, we're trying to jump ahead of the game and highlight that new wave of people using the different means to get the info out.
[02:42:17.151 --> 02:42:20.936]  The info culture, whether it's art, music, whatever, we're trying to highlight that.
[02:42:20.976 --> 02:42:23.980]  NewWorldActivist.com, Truth Exposed Radio, and it's going on.
[02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:28.045]  I mean, lots of people are waking up, young kids and everybody into everything, and they're doing different things.
[02:42:28.065 --> 02:42:29.727]  Like, We Are Change Atlanta made the, uh...
[02:42:30.288 --> 02:42:30.829]  Absolutely.
[02:42:30.869 --> 02:42:31.950]  Talking to Rachel France.
[02:42:31.970 --> 02:42:36.153]  Rachel, as you begin to research more and more of this, how has it changed your view of the world?
[02:42:49.517 --> 02:42:51.238]  That's completely changed my view of the world.
[02:42:51.318 --> 02:43:09.983]  It turned everything upside down for me, and not in a good way, but it is, I don't know, just being able to like feel like, I don't know, sometimes you feel that you can't really do anything and it's very frustrating because you're only one person and there's so much, you know, that needs to be done, but if everybody could just, you know, do something.
[02:43:10.364 --> 02:43:14.545]  Like my thing is having time, you know, a lot of people say they don't have time and
[02:43:15.405 --> 02:43:18.428]  Um, you can always make time, you know, to do this.
[02:43:18.508 --> 02:43:20.150]  Even if it's a little thing, just find your niche.
[02:43:20.190 --> 02:43:21.932]  I'm not a political person.
[02:43:21.992 --> 02:43:28.718]  I'm not, I'm not really even a person who likes to, you know, speak in front of people, or I'm kind of shy, but... But you're doing it!
[02:43:29.239 --> 02:43:29.679]  Yeah, I am.
[02:43:29.699 --> 02:43:30.860]  You're doing a good job, too.
[02:43:31.941 --> 02:43:35.725]  No, but it's just, uh, it's really important, and it's something that you can't ignore, so...
[02:43:37.086 --> 02:43:42.293]  Well, that's what's allowed the corruption to grow and grow and grow until they're telling people they can't have tomatoes in their yard.
[02:43:42.313 --> 02:43:46.058]  They're telling people you can't speak at city council even though it's the law that you can.
[02:43:46.078 --> 02:43:49.643]  I mean, it's just showing that government has gone crazy.
[02:43:50.698 --> 02:43:53.520]  I mean, we're going to live under the exact amount of tyranny that we put up with.
[02:43:53.740 --> 02:43:57.422]  And if everyone just sits back and just gets lazy, and that's what's happening in America.
[02:43:57.442 --> 02:43:58.482]  I mean, I think we've just gotten lazy.
[02:43:59.183 --> 02:44:01.164]  We let the mainstream media tell us what's going on in the world.
[02:44:01.184 --> 02:44:02.284]  We don't do our own research.
[02:44:02.945 --> 02:44:04.565]  And I mean, we just say, hey, you know what?
[02:44:04.866 --> 02:44:05.766]  It'll get taken care of.
[02:44:05.826 --> 02:44:06.907]  It's just what happens.
[02:44:06.927 --> 02:44:07.607]  It's just politics.
[02:44:07.667 --> 02:44:08.508]  No, it's not.
[02:44:08.548 --> 02:44:10.289]  It's not the left-right battling back and forth.
[02:44:10.589 --> 02:44:12.390]  You know, oh, it's liberal or conservative.
[02:44:12.410 --> 02:44:14.531]  No, this is a system taking over.
[02:44:15.091 --> 02:44:18.375]  I mean, we are being hijacked as a nation, as a world, as humanity.
[02:44:18.395 --> 02:44:20.678]  I mean, look at what the globalists are doing to the whole world.
[02:44:20.999 --> 02:44:23.602]  I mean, they're messing up with the DNA structure of the entire Earth.
[02:44:24.203 --> 02:44:29.690]  I mean, they're messing... Oh yeah, our DNA's fried, fertility's plunging, cancer's exploding, diabetes is exploding.
[02:44:29.730 --> 02:44:33.215]  I got stacks of articles here where they openly talk about getting rid of us.
[02:44:34.505 --> 02:44:35.105]  That's their plan.
[02:44:35.145 --> 02:44:36.845]  I mean, they want the planet to themselves.
[02:44:36.925 --> 02:44:40.106]  I mean, who really knows at the very core exactly what they want?
[02:44:40.146 --> 02:44:41.846]  You know, a lot of people want to know all the answers.
[02:44:41.866 --> 02:44:45.027]  And we got there and talked to them like, well, tell us how they did this, what they're going to do here.
[02:44:45.207 --> 02:44:45.827]  Look, we don't know.
[02:44:45.887 --> 02:44:48.187]  We're seeing the basic framework of what's going on.
[02:44:48.207 --> 02:44:52.768]  And I mean, the basic framework is enough to get you up and active and saying, look, I'm... Exactly.
[02:44:52.808 --> 02:44:56.489]  I mean, if I was a wild pig and I got caught in a trap, I'd want to get out.
[02:44:56.509 --> 02:44:58.229]  You know, animals know that.
[02:44:58.369 --> 02:44:59.709]  Animals won't eat the GMO.
[02:45:00.049 --> 02:45:01.210]  But, you know, humans do.
[02:45:01.250 --> 02:45:03.250]  In fact, I have all these articles I meant to get to today.
[02:45:04.266 --> 02:45:22.894]  I mean, here's one, Fox News, cell phones, cancer, and infertility, and it goes through the fact of all these governments are even admitting, and major research institutes, after the fact, that fertility is plunging, cell phones and rat studies do destroy fertility, double the chance of brain cancers, and again,
[02:45:24.150 --> 02:45:29.656]  Why was I called a kook 14, 15 years ago for covering that from studies that were out then?
[02:45:30.016 --> 02:45:30.777]  They knew then.
[02:45:30.797 --> 02:45:35.461]  Just now the cancers are exploding, now they're acting like they tried to protect us from it.
[02:45:35.742 --> 02:45:38.124]  And these elitists have their own kids using cell phones.
[02:45:38.444 --> 02:45:41.007]  I mean, there's a self-destructiveness to it.
[02:45:41.087 --> 02:45:44.589]  When the WHO came out with it, that's when the whole mainstream media talked about it.
[02:45:44.689 --> 02:45:48.771]  When the World Health Organization said, yeah, it's causing cancer, then they'll all talk about it.
[02:45:48.791 --> 02:45:49.451]  Now it's okay!
[02:45:49.471 --> 02:45:55.014]  Now it's okay to talk about it, but when it was, you know, a bunch, a big group of people are saying, no, for a long time it causes cancer.
[02:45:55.034 --> 02:45:57.975]  I mean, a lot of people I talked to knew it, but they didn't ever want to talk about that.
[02:45:57.995 --> 02:45:58.436]  It was crazy.
[02:45:58.456 --> 02:45:59.176]  That was on the fringe.
[02:45:59.216 --> 02:46:00.297]  But now, yep, it's out there.
[02:46:00.317 --> 02:46:01.797]  And that's what they're going to do with everything.
[02:46:01.837 --> 02:46:04.499]  Guarantee you one day they're going to say, yep, 9-11 was an inside job.
[02:46:04.519 --> 02:46:05.679]  Just like they did with Golf of Tompkins.
[02:46:05.799 --> 02:46:07.120]  Oh yeah, it's declassified.
[02:46:07.160 --> 02:46:08.541]  Yeah, it never happened.
[02:46:09.201 --> 02:46:13.404]  It's, you know, way down the line they kind of tend to leak a little more information, but it's obvious.
[02:46:13.444 --> 02:46:21.849]  We're setting a trend, we're ahead of the curve, breaking news articles, doing street actions, you know, like y'all are doing here, breaking the news before it even hits mainstream.
[02:46:21.869 --> 02:46:26.092]  We're trying to hit the same information with the streets and really encouraging people to take action.
[02:46:26.112 --> 02:46:28.174]  There's so many different ways you can get this information out.
[02:46:28.194 --> 02:46:29.174]  We don't have time to waste.
[02:46:29.194 --> 02:46:30.335]  We're trying to shut down the internet.
[02:46:30.635 --> 02:46:35.237]  They're poisoning us even worse, I mean, uh, enforcing these, uh, light bulbs in our houses here.
[02:46:35.277 --> 02:46:37.017]  You know, it's just- Yeah, tomorrow doesn't stop.
[02:46:37.037 --> 02:46:38.037]  Tomorrow is not promised.
[02:46:38.197 --> 02:46:38.698]  Use today.
[02:46:39.058 --> 02:46:42.459]  Get active now, and that's what- that's the one message we'd want to say to everybody out there.
[02:46:42.479 --> 02:46:43.699]  That's what Truth and Expose Radio is about.
[02:46:43.719 --> 02:46:45.000]  That's what humanity is about.
[02:46:45.020 --> 02:46:48.641]  It's getting active, not just sitting back and- and, you know, waiting for somebody else to appear.
[02:46:48.661 --> 02:46:49.241]  Does it matter your beliefs?
[02:46:49.241 --> 02:46:50.302]  We're good to go.
[02:47:07.345 --> 02:47:13.286]  So as an info warrior, you don't really need to be an info snob speaking to the audience and get upset at people for not getting it.
[02:47:13.306 --> 02:47:16.747]  You've got to humble your heart and have mercy on them and hope that they'll wake up someday.
[02:47:17.027 --> 02:47:22.389]  Be an example of what it means to be awake and do creative things and merciful things for those around you.
[02:47:22.609 --> 02:47:26.890]  And we can be examples to those around us and get really a wave of being a good person going.
[02:47:26.930 --> 02:47:27.410]  Exactly.
[02:47:27.450 --> 02:47:30.290]  We can't look at these people and call them just morons.
[02:47:30.711 --> 02:47:32.191]  They are literally in a trance.
[02:47:32.751 --> 02:47:39.193]  They are physically living in a false reality, like sheep going off the edge of a cliff, and we've got to warn them.
[02:47:39.213 --> 02:47:42.294]  We've got to wake these sheep up, not just for them, but for us.
[02:47:42.334 --> 02:47:53.618]  We have no future if we don't do this, because as the globalists implode society, they're going to direct the sheep, who are confused, against every good institution, everything that's wholesome.
[02:47:53.638 --> 02:48:01.341]  I mean, look at this article out of the Age newspaper in Australia, and literally there are hundreds of these a week now coming out in the corporate New World Order brainwashing media.
[02:48:02.481 --> 02:48:06.903]  Humans become pets in the rise of the machines, Apple co-founder says.
[02:48:07.884 --> 02:48:09.325]  And that's Steve Wonsnick.
[02:48:09.985 --> 02:48:11.526]  And then I have all these other articles.
[02:48:11.546 --> 02:48:29.776]  The head of Sun Microsystems saying, in Why the Future Doesn't Need Us, in Wired Magazine, he says, I've met with the elite and they're discussing, this is in 98, should we kill everyone in the world government or do we give people something to do and, you know, take care of them like pets because we're going to merge with the machines.
[02:48:29.836 --> 02:48:31.277]  Now, whether that's going to happen or not,
[02:48:31.897 --> 02:48:35.440]  You know, Ray Kurzweil, their guru, The Age of Spiritual Machines.
[02:48:35.500 --> 02:48:36.560]  In fact, Aaron's back there.
[02:48:36.600 --> 02:48:52.351]  He's got the Eugenics Society publication with Julian Huxley, and this was even in the 60s after people knew about Hitler and everything, saying this would be their plan, The Age of Spiritual Machines, and they talk about how they're going to merge with machines.
[02:48:52.431 --> 02:48:53.032]  Singularity.
[02:48:53.612 --> 02:48:55.934]  Exactly, and get rid of the rest of us.
[02:48:56.314 --> 02:49:00.537]  Yeah, actually, me and her watched that documentary, Transcendent Man, and we were blown away.
[02:49:00.597 --> 02:49:03.720]  I mean, we were watching the whole time thinking, this guy literally wants to be God.
[02:49:03.940 --> 02:49:05.781]  I mean, the way he acted, he's like, I don't want to die.
[02:49:06.061 --> 02:49:07.282]  He wants to bring his dad back.
[02:49:07.342 --> 02:49:09.724]  He wants to make, like, a robot of his dad.
[02:49:09.744 --> 02:49:11.806]  I mean, these people are messed up in the head.
[02:49:11.826 --> 02:49:15.308]  Well, yeah, he said, in fact, the quote is, he says, I don't believe in God yet.
[02:49:16.249 --> 02:49:17.931]  But I'm going to be God.
[02:49:18.091 --> 02:49:19.593]  Yeah, that's exactly right.
[02:49:19.633 --> 02:49:22.896]  And these are the conversations going on behind the closed doors.
[02:49:23.216 --> 02:49:24.738]  Everyone's going, oh, what are they talking about?
[02:49:24.758 --> 02:49:25.659]  It's behind the closed doors.
[02:49:25.899 --> 02:49:27.020]  No, this is what's going on.
[02:49:27.040 --> 02:49:28.502]  I mean, this is what people are talking about.
[02:49:28.722 --> 02:49:32.846]  Yeah, I mean, whether it's real or not, I mean, whether they're going to be able to manifest this or not,
[02:49:33.627 --> 02:49:34.608]  They all go to meetings.
[02:49:34.688 --> 02:49:35.808]  William Shatner goes.
[02:49:36.148 --> 02:49:37.049]  They're closed doors.
[02:49:37.209 --> 02:49:38.210]  Thousands of elitists.
[02:49:38.750 --> 02:49:40.591]  And the minutes have come out.
[02:49:40.611 --> 02:49:41.351]  They've written books.
[02:49:41.391 --> 02:49:42.552]  The Rockefellers go to it.
[02:49:43.112 --> 02:49:46.094]  And they talk about, we can't give the life extension to the public.
[02:49:46.594 --> 02:49:48.756]  We're going to slowly wipe everybody out.
[02:49:49.296 --> 02:49:51.357]  And then we're going to be transcendent and live forever.
[02:49:51.977 --> 02:49:56.600]  And then they write about, well, actually, most of the people we're recruiting aren't going to get this.
[02:49:56.840 --> 02:49:58.061]  We're going to kill them later too.
[02:49:58.661 --> 02:50:02.503]  I mean, this is such a psychopathic, crazy thing.
[02:50:02.523 --> 02:50:02.883]  Here it is.
[02:50:03.224 --> 02:50:04.404]  Evolutionary Studies.
[02:50:05.265 --> 02:50:13.990]  And it says, a certainty celebration of the life of Julian Huxley, edited by Milo Kynes and Answorth Harrison.
[02:50:14.470 --> 02:50:16.971]  And if you look, it's put out by the Eugenics Society.
[02:50:17.451 --> 02:50:25.476]  And this is the founder of transhumanism that they've all just repackaged and put out low-level stuff for the general public, like Transcendent Man.
[02:50:25.996 --> 02:50:32.582]  You get deeper into what they all write about, they're gonna kill us, and it's wonderful and beautiful, and they're gonna be God.
[02:50:33.583 --> 02:50:35.545]  And again, that's Ray Kurzweil.
[02:50:36.426 --> 02:50:38.988]  Bill Joy says that this is a terrible thing.
[02:50:39.349 --> 02:50:41.831]  He says, I think you should know they're talking about killing everybody.
[02:50:42.191 --> 02:50:44.614]  This is Wired Magazine, Sun Microsystems founder.
[02:50:45.034 --> 02:50:45.534]  Yeah, this is bad.
[02:50:45.575 --> 02:50:48.037]  I mean, I mean, you might want to, yeah, you might want to listen to that.
[02:50:48.217 --> 02:50:49.618]  But, you know, they sell it like it's cool.
[02:50:49.658 --> 02:50:53.982]  You know, the head of Sega is saying that, you know, one day video games are going to be chips in your body.
[02:50:54.022 --> 02:50:55.804]  And then Ray Kurzweil is talking about that.
[02:50:55.824 --> 02:50:56.864]  They're going to make it trendy.
[02:50:56.885 --> 02:50:59.407]  But they're only going to give us the level of it that doesn't enslave us.
[02:50:59.727 --> 02:51:01.469]  They're building the architecture to dehumanize us.
[02:51:01.489 --> 02:51:07.474]  Hey, Brian, if you could do just one thing today to ensure your family's food security, what would it be?
[02:51:07.754 --> 02:51:08.594]  That's easy, Bill.
[02:51:08.774 --> 02:51:12.616]  I'd head straight to soupbeansurvival.com.
[02:51:12.896 --> 02:51:14.096]  Soupbeansurvival.com?
[02:51:14.416 --> 02:51:24.360]  I know, Bill, it sounds crazy, but this ancient secret has been around for over 8,000 years, and it truly is nature's super survival food.
[02:51:24.560 --> 02:51:25.141]  Really, Brian?

[02:51:27.183 --> 02:51:29.085]  Well, certainly the forgotten survival food.
[02:51:29.325 --> 02:51:30.186]  Absolutely, Bill.
[02:51:30.346 --> 02:51:41.698]  The folks at soupbeansurvival.com scoured our planet to find the very best heirloom seeds to truly find nature's super survival food.

[02:51:44.020 --> 02:51:44.721]  No way, Bill.
[02:51:44.761 --> 02:51:47.284]  You're not going to find these beans in any grocery store.
[02:51:47.424 --> 02:51:50.788]  These are the absolute highest quality beans in the world.

[02:54:08.355 --> 02:54:18.018]  You know, I haven't read this worship of Julian Huxley, the former head of the UN UNESCO program that sets the policy for our public schools.
[02:54:19.438 --> 02:54:24.640]  I haven't read this one, so Aaron ran in during the break and he said, look, you've got to look
[02:54:25.831 --> 02:54:35.983]  at chapter 13 where they say that the UN and Huxley set this up as the new world religion of transhumanism which is really eugenics.
[02:54:36.544 --> 02:54:41.029]  And it says eugenics is the world religion and this is the religion the elite follow.
[02:54:41.792 --> 02:54:44.255]  Now I've never seen them say eugenics was their religion.
[02:54:44.375 --> 02:54:49.021]  I had always said they behave and act like it's a religion and follow it like a religion.
[02:54:49.321 --> 02:54:51.464]  Here they are saying it is their religion.
[02:54:51.925 --> 02:54:53.847]  This is the founder of transhumanism.
[02:54:54.147 --> 02:54:59.053]  And you have Bertrand Russell who's another eugenicist, Nobel Prize winner, so-called anti-war
[02:54:59.814 --> 02:55:05.818]  Uh, a thinker who's, uh, saying in his writing, Scientific Society, also talking about setting up the Eugenics Society.
[02:55:06.198 --> 02:55:10.121]  He was saying how Christianity is politically incorrect because it teaches individualism.
[02:55:10.421 --> 02:55:19.066]  And it's anything that teaches individualism is what they don't want because they want us in that collective mindset of the mainstream illusion and want us to plug into their electronics, uh, devices.
[02:55:19.127 --> 02:55:22.869]  Unfortunately, you know, I'm kind of... They want bio... Well, it's not that the electronics are even evil.
[02:55:23.209 --> 02:55:26.391]  It's how they're engineering them is their main bend.
[02:55:26.451 --> 02:55:29.993]  They engineer tracking control that you then pay for when you buy it.
[02:55:30.134 --> 02:55:35.877]  And then there's a new headline yesterday, I forgot to bring up, that they're saying now that electronic devices are coming with malware.
[02:55:35.897 --> 02:55:37.498]  Did you see that headline?
[02:55:37.538 --> 02:55:39.179]  It was from last night, I saw it.
[02:55:39.520 --> 02:55:43.662]  And that more than likely in the next year we're going to see a lot of phones being hacked.
[02:55:44.583 --> 02:55:46.044]  Well no, no, that's how they spun it.
[02:55:46.144 --> 02:55:49.526]  Oh my gosh, all the major products, hackers can get in.
[02:55:49.546 --> 02:55:50.507]  Well that's because the government
[02:55:51.147 --> 02:55:55.370]  Under the Telecommunications Act of 96, it's law that the back doors are there.
[02:55:55.870 --> 02:55:57.391]  Yeah, they're gonna stage a bunch of hackings.
[02:55:57.471 --> 02:55:58.071]  They're gonna do it.
[02:55:58.131 --> 02:55:59.252]  It's on its horizon.
[02:55:59.292 --> 02:56:01.253]  I mean, we're seeing that coming over the horizon right now.
[02:56:01.273 --> 02:56:03.755]  Well, that's what the cyber security base in San Antonio is.
[02:56:04.195 --> 02:56:05.256]  It's to launch their attacks.
[02:56:05.276 --> 02:56:06.556]  Military City, USA.
[02:56:06.596 --> 02:56:09.278]  And then outlaws their patents to stop your video from recording video.
[02:56:10.839 --> 02:56:16.260]  Stopping your cell phones from recording video at a... No, they admit the cops just hit a button and all electronics turns off.
[02:56:16.280 --> 02:56:17.300]  That's gonna be spread everywhere.
[02:56:17.480 --> 02:56:18.121]  That's gonna be spread.
[02:56:18.141 --> 02:56:20.801]  I mean, that's not gonna... Maybe I shouldn't give you those lower-tech cameras.
[02:56:20.821 --> 02:56:29.903]  We need to keep all this, quote, old tech, because they're engineering spy grids and AI systems into everything, and that's why they're going to drones.
[02:56:29.943 --> 02:56:37.305]  That's why they're getting away from actual troops, because soon, that's why they wrote, the future won't need us, because the globalists are gonna have their mechanized system.
[02:56:37.785 --> 02:56:41.175]  Yeah, they're gonna commit some bad evil with those robots they're creating too.
[02:56:42.352 --> 02:56:44.433]  Well, they're trying to keep... No, not evil, peace.
[02:56:44.913 --> 02:56:46.033]  Yeah, my bad, my bad.
[02:56:46.073 --> 02:56:47.433]  War is peace, my friend.
[02:56:47.733 --> 02:56:48.474]  Evil is good.
[02:56:48.494 --> 02:56:50.994]  You're talking about the robots, the AI, they're going to be our butlers, aren't they?
[02:56:51.734 --> 02:57:00.516]  Like in the Jetsons and like all the science fiction, you know, everything we're... Well, no, they are going to be your butler in the first wave, but it's spying on you the whole time.
[02:57:00.897 --> 02:57:05.478]  You already see that in all the cell phones and all the architecture under global standardization.
[02:57:06.038 --> 02:57:06.198]  Yeah.
[02:57:06.298 --> 02:57:07.418]  They wouldn't do something secret.
[02:57:07.438 --> 02:57:10.219]  They've been taking baby's blood for 39 years secretly, now, admit it.
[02:57:11.007 --> 02:57:11.891]  Yeah, they wouldn't lie to us.
[02:57:11.951 --> 02:57:14.924]  By the way, they store the blood samples for most of the U.S.
[02:57:15.004 --> 02:57:15.708]  in San Antonio.
[02:57:17.187 --> 02:57:18.088]  Yeah, I'm sure they do.
[02:57:18.108 --> 02:57:21.229]  Isn't that loving?
[02:57:21.509 --> 02:57:23.310]  Yeah, it's loving over there in San Antonio.
[02:57:23.390 --> 02:57:27.992]  Military City USA with four bases and NSA and oh my gosh.
[02:57:28.072 --> 02:57:30.153]  And Microsoft.
[02:57:30.173 --> 02:57:37.576]  And then the University there in San Antonio has a specific cyber security course that they've spent millions on.
[02:57:37.596 --> 02:57:39.377]  So I mean, they're definitely gearing out.
[02:57:39.417 --> 02:57:43.819]  They're setting up a military factory in San Antonio and here we are, the rogue little
[02:57:44.119 --> 02:57:47.362]  We are James San Antonio, the family, you know, wandering the streets.
[02:57:47.382 --> 02:57:51.026]  Well, you're the white blood cells recognizing the cancer.
[02:57:51.386 --> 02:57:56.191]  And the cancer's saying, no, no, no, I'm taking over my country, my world.
[02:57:56.591 --> 02:58:01.456]  Take your shots, drink your sodium fluoride, drink your bisphenol A laced plastic.
[02:58:01.656 --> 02:58:03.358]  I'm gonna kill you, Medina.
[02:58:04.119 --> 02:58:06.041]  We're saying, I don't think so, bring it on.
[02:58:06.341 --> 02:58:08.684]  They want a war, they're going to get a war.
[02:58:08.764 --> 02:58:19.776]  They need us as biological androids to finish their electronic construct and then they're going to get rid of us, they say, in the next evolutionary step in their religion of eugenics and death.
[02:58:19.876 --> 02:58:22.038]  Ray Kurzweil talks about the singularity coming.
[02:58:22.639 --> 02:58:23.640]  We don't have long though.
[02:58:24.020 --> 02:58:31.126]  And all you cops and servants of this, and even you globalist technicians that know this but think you're part of the Chosen Ones, you're not.
[02:58:31.607 --> 02:58:33.809]  You didn't get a memo about Bisphenol, eh, did you?
[02:58:34.429 --> 02:58:36.311]  Guys, this main transmission is over.
[02:58:36.351 --> 02:58:37.492]  Mike Adams filling in tomorrow.
[02:58:37.512 --> 02:58:40.715]  We have a special Great Broadcast Friday lined up for you.
[02:58:42.156 --> 02:58:44.919]  Back in one minute.
[02:58:44.939 --> 02:58:47.561]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:47.581 --> 02:58:49.523]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:52.739 --> 02:58:56.363]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:58:56.763 --> 02:58:59.766]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:59:00.006 --> 02:59:04.790]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:59:04.810 --> 02:59:11.036]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:59:11.196 --> 02:59:13.439]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:59:13.959 --> 02:59:14.239]  Tim Geithner?
[02:59:14.259 --> 02:59:14.699]  Bernanke?
[02:59:14.780 --> 02:59:15.540]  They're arsonists!
[02:59:15.580 --> 02:59:16.721]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:59:16.741 --> 02:59:18.982]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:59:32.870 --> 02:59:34.711]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:59:34.731 --> 02:59:39.772]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[02:59:40.152 --> 02:59:50.076]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:59:52.216 --> 02:59:55.197]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.818 --> 02:59:59.019]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:13.462 --> 03:00:17.330]  Well, I want to thank, uh...
[03:00:21.963 --> 03:00:25.185]  Rachel France, I want to thank Matthew Medina and Cody Hess for coming in.
[03:00:25.205 --> 03:00:26.245]  You guys are doing a great job.
[03:00:26.625 --> 03:00:31.828]  I wanted to get Aaron to pop in because you have the Eugenics Society in this book worshipping Aldous Huxley.
[03:00:32.468 --> 03:00:42.092]  This is the progenitor of Ray Kurzweil and all the rest of them saying, you know, if humans are even allowed to stay around, we'll be pets of the globalists that have merged with machines.
[03:00:42.693 --> 03:00:45.174]  And of course, that's the co-founder of Apple saying that.
[03:00:45.854 --> 03:00:54.121]  And that's why you have folks like Bill Joy who went to meetings, and he says, I was with 200 top technology owners, and they said, do we kill everybody?
[03:00:54.742 --> 03:00:57.144]  I mean, this is all, and the decision's been made, yes.
[03:00:57.584 --> 03:01:04.810]  So the cancer's doubled in the last 10 years, the diabetes, people are dying all around us, it's only gonna get worse, we're all being killed incrementally.
[03:01:04.830 --> 03:01:10.275]  Aaron Dykes has now researched this one area probably deeper than I even have, he just
[03:01:11.536 --> 03:01:13.259]  Probably a hundred of their own writings.
[03:01:13.719 --> 03:01:15.862]  Aaron, they think they've got us.
[03:01:16.483 --> 03:01:17.304]  What's your take on this?
[03:01:19.451 --> 03:01:31.961]  Well, the eugenic system really is the world state declaring over a hundred years ago that they have the right to control our life processes, who gets to breed, who gets to live, who gets to die, you know.
[03:01:33.382 --> 03:01:41.788]  George Bernard Shaw talked about how under socialism you'd be forcibly fed, clothes fed, and if you weren't good enough you'd be kindly exterminated.
[03:01:42.109 --> 03:01:43.210]  Well, it's that same system.
[03:01:43.250 --> 03:01:44.791]  Now they have the machines, so bye-bye!
[03:01:45.231 --> 03:01:46.533]  Eugenics is that system.
[03:01:46.553 --> 03:01:48.055]  Thing is, the elite don't need us.
[03:01:48.555 --> 03:01:49.837]  Life's always been cheap.
[03:01:49.917 --> 03:01:51.359]  Now it's something toxic.
[03:01:51.940 --> 03:01:53.862]  He talked about... That's why we're being taught humans are evil.
[03:01:54.042 --> 03:01:56.145]  So we'll accept... Oh, we're dying for Earth!
[03:01:57.659 --> 03:02:09.448]  He's talking about Bertrand Russell, who is connected with Julian Huxley on this UNESCO project, which is education, science, culture, the whole thing, your whole life revolves around this eugenics idea.
[03:02:09.468 --> 03:02:16.454]  And then here it is, in this eugenics society, appraisal of Julian Huxley, brother of Alice Huxley's life.
[03:02:16.974 --> 03:02:31.963]  In chapter 13 is Julian Huxley and eugenics, which he wrote extensively on, and they have one quote from a Dean Inge, who says eugenics is capable of becoming the most sacred ideal of the human race, as a race, one of the supreme religious duties.
[03:02:32.443 --> 03:02:34.545]  Huxley says, I agree entirely.
[03:02:34.565 --> 03:02:37.907]  One of the implications of evolutionary biology are grasped
[03:02:38.567 --> 03:02:46.931]  Eugenics will inevitably become part of the religion of the future, or whatever complex of sentiments may in the future take the place of organized religion.
[03:02:47.451 --> 03:03:01.178]  And Bertrand Russell wrote about the same thing as part of this eugenic... And their religion is, by definition, do as thou wilt, we will go unwilling, we will kill all of you, we will merge with machines, I don't believe in God, not yet, I will be your God, I am Ray Kurzweil.
[03:03:01.758 --> 03:03:04.199]  And then they write about how they're all going to kill each other, too.
[03:03:04.280 --> 03:03:06.521]  It's going to be one, one, one left.
[03:03:06.881 --> 03:03:08.682]  There's going to be one Lucifer left.
[03:03:08.962 --> 03:03:09.723]  Kill everything else.
[03:03:10.143 --> 03:03:18.147]  And part of this, too, Bertrand Russell talks about after a generation of state-controlled education, children will believe snow is black, you know, whatever they tell them.
[03:03:18.628 --> 03:03:19.108]  Anything.
[03:03:19.348 --> 03:03:24.031]  And smart students will either become part of this hive borg, or they'll be killed.
[03:03:24.051 --> 03:03:26.012]  The education will only be for the elite.
[03:03:26.032 --> 03:03:27.072]  But that's liberal!
[03:03:27.693 --> 03:03:29.514]  Liberals call me, but it's liberal!
[03:03:30.214 --> 03:03:30.855]  It's liberal!
[03:03:30.915 --> 03:03:31.675]  Kill everyone!
[03:03:31.776 --> 03:03:32.296]  Liberal!
[03:03:32.536 --> 03:03:33.137]  It's trendy.
[03:03:33.177 --> 03:03:33.877]  It's the way of the future.
[03:03:33.897 --> 03:03:35.038]  It's what everyone's doing.
[03:03:35.058 --> 03:03:36.780]  It's in the commercials.
[03:03:36.820 --> 03:03:37.681]  It's in the movies.
[03:03:37.721 --> 03:03:38.502]  It's in the music.
[03:03:38.542 --> 03:03:39.763]  It's in the music videos.
[03:03:40.148 --> 03:03:42.871]  But it's that whole 1984 re-education system.
[03:03:43.031 --> 03:03:43.611]  Admit it!
[03:03:44.432 --> 03:03:45.313]  We're told that it's good.
[03:03:45.333 --> 03:03:48.296]  That's what UNESCO is.
[03:03:48.336 --> 03:03:50.578]  He's talking about making engineering society like these.
[03:03:50.598 --> 03:03:54.301]  These guys engineer society, cultures, and we've been trying to expose it.
[03:03:54.341 --> 03:03:59.406]  We had run-ins, Alex, with the foundation-funded activist group a year and a half ago.
[03:03:59.426 --> 03:04:03.710]  We were talking about it during the Robert Rodriguez machete during that time because
[03:04:04.210 --> 03:04:18.556]  You know, the public, you know, believe, they believe the foundation-funded activist groups are fed the story that the white man's the enemy, and, you know, it's indigenous people versus the white people, and that's a real fight, and, you know, the political beliefs is socialism.
[03:04:18.576 --> 03:04:28.280]  And then that's funded by the actual globalists that are spiking their vaccines, so they can go, we're your friend, we hate white people, by the way, the big mega-corporations run us, now take these shots.
[03:04:28.860 --> 03:04:32.182]  And we had a run-in with a person down the street, San Antonio, during a street action.
[03:04:32.202 --> 03:04:34.844]  We have that video on the We Are Change San Antonio YouTube channel.
[03:04:35.164 --> 03:04:37.265]  It's called, quote, Infowars is racist.
[03:04:37.285 --> 03:04:40.708]  And we run into one of these people, and the video would break it down, expand it.
[03:04:41.108 --> 03:04:42.249]  I've seen the video, yeah.
[03:04:42.589 --> 03:04:44.930]  So that's just an example of social engineering.
[03:04:45.171 --> 03:04:48.613]  We're talking about engineering society and the scientific society.
[03:04:48.933 --> 03:04:50.814]  I mean, this is all well-documented.
[03:04:50.834 --> 03:04:52.575]  Well, it's playing us off against each other.
[03:04:52.615 --> 03:04:53.576]  We're out of time.
[03:04:54.076 --> 03:04:55.237]  All of you guys, great job.
[03:04:55.277 --> 03:04:57.959]  Aaron, you shot a video on your new YouTube channel about that book, didn't you?
[03:04:58.519 --> 03:04:59.520]  Uh, not about this program.
[03:04:59.540 --> 03:05:01.301]  Uh, we'll shoot one on, it's important.
[03:05:01.861 --> 03:05:02.722]  Uh, Mike Adams tomorrow.
