[00:00:05.097 --> 00:00:09.941]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.941 --> 00:00:11.522]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.522 --> 00:00:13.064]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.064 --> 00:00:17.267]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:30.398]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.398 --> 00:00:32.560]  Okay, my friends, here we are live.
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.701]  It's Wednesday.
[00:00:35.882 --> 00:00:43.666]  The 14th day of December 2011, and the news just gets more insane by the day.
[00:00:43.666 --> 00:01:02.676]  Congressman Issa, the guy that's now said he's not going to move forward with trying to impeach or prosecute the Attorney General, the Attorney General over law enforcement, federal law enforcement, a total criminal on record, a serial perjurer, a false flag terrorist,
[00:01:03.476 --> 00:01:07.198]  Who has been caught red-handed shipping guns into Mexico, cocaine back into the country.
[00:01:07.198 --> 00:01:09.399]  That's in all the federal court hearings.
[00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:11.440]  It's admitted.
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.622]  To blame the Second Amendment, that's all public.
[00:01:14.622 --> 00:01:20.485]  And Issa said a week ago, I guess a week and a half ago, well it's up to Obama now if you're going to be fired.
[00:01:20.485 --> 00:01:23.586]  I've done my investigation, you lied.
[00:01:23.586 --> 00:01:28.489]  And Holder was arrogant in the hearings and didn't care.
[00:01:30.353 --> 00:01:40.200]  Pointed out that Bush ran similar operations, and so the Republican Party says back off, because they're involved in it all as well.
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:49.566]  And so even if Issa himself isn't involved in all this, the Republican Party says stand down, they stand down, and now the sky is the limit of what Holder can do.
[00:01:51.343 --> 00:01:58.870]  You know, they had a big phone takeover drill a few days ago that scared everybody in New Jersey when the government hijacked their phones.
[00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.993]  They spun it to say, oh, it was just the provider that did it.
[00:02:01.993 --> 00:02:07.498]  But now, government fear-mongering alerts to go live tomorrow.
[00:02:08.596 --> 00:02:12.018]  In test cities like New York, where they're going to break in over your phone.
[00:02:12.018 --> 00:02:14.360]  The government said it won't just be text in the future.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.202]  Your phone, your phone call will be disconnected.
[00:02:17.202 --> 00:02:25.128]  Whatever you're doing on your little handheld computer, that smart device, and it will be videos of the president or videos of the police chief and at Walmarts and...
[00:02:25.848 --> 00:02:30.990]  Malls and on street corners, big telescreens saying, trust no one but government.
[00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.251]  These are already going in at thousands of locations.
[00:02:33.251 --> 00:02:35.452]  Only trust your loving government.
[00:02:35.452 --> 00:02:43.996]  I mean, it's like they went and got some dystopic science fiction movie of a nightmare police state future and said, let's just have it be outrageous.
[00:02:43.996 --> 00:02:48.438]  And do it!
[00:02:48.438 --> 00:02:48.619]  So...
[00:02:50.273 --> 00:02:51.514]  Here is the Daily Caller.
[00:02:51.514 --> 00:02:57.739]  Congressman Issa, privacy bill would give Holder broad new powers to police the internet.
[00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:03.683]  The Washington Post, The Hill, they all admit it's quote Chinese style model of censorship.
[00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:06.305]  Communist Chinese government style.
[00:03:06.305 --> 00:03:10.268]  And they admit that it is a free speech kill switch, that's one headline.
[00:03:11.252 --> 00:03:22.443]  And that there's no due process, and the government and private corporations can just shut down anything they want, and they've already admittedly been grabbing sites, many of which that are totally innocent, but are destroyed.
[00:03:22.443 --> 00:03:24.706]  Million dollar sites.
[00:03:24.706 --> 00:03:33.054]  Because in a message board, somebody links to a place where there's some copyright music, or a copyright article, and then none of it's even proven.
[00:03:36.308 --> 00:03:38.710]  This is another form of their tyranny.
[00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:43.614]  Internet taxes, internet tracking, all of this is now unfolding.
[00:03:43.614 --> 00:03:46.816]  So that's just one of the articles we have.
[00:03:46.816 --> 00:03:58.465]  We have a gentleman that comes highly recommended from Oath Keepers, who's a former East German government individual.
[00:03:58.465 --> 00:03:59.927]  And he is going to be
[00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.381]  Talking about the parallels with what's happening here in the United States.
[00:04:05.381 --> 00:04:12.644]  A member of Texas Housekeepers was a lieutenant colonel in the East German Army when communism collapsed and the Berlin Wall came down in 89.
[00:04:12.644 --> 00:04:18.185]  So he can tell you all about the Stasi and the rest of it.
[00:04:18.185 --> 00:04:21.426]  He's going to be in studio because he lives in Texas.
[00:04:21.426 --> 00:04:26.548]  And then of course we have Max Keiser joining us in 30 minutes.
[00:04:26.548 --> 00:04:28.949]  The rats are leaving the sinking ship.
[00:04:30.228 --> 00:04:33.289]  On the case of MF Global, I'll give you that good news.
[00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:38.151]  On the other side, I saw this at Zero Hedge last night, up at InfoWars.com.
[00:04:38.151 --> 00:04:39.251]  We had it linked.
[00:04:39.251 --> 00:04:42.452]  I saw it this morning in the Financial Times of London.
[00:04:42.452 --> 00:04:51.915]  Yesterday, during another one of the congressional testimonies, the head of the CME Group decided to not go down with the ship.
[00:04:51.915 --> 00:04:55.997]  And he went ahead and blew the whistle on Mr. Corzine.
[00:04:55.997 --> 00:04:56.477]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.774 --> 00:05:07.417]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:05:07.417 --> 00:05:12.559]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:21.283]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:05:21.283 --> 00:05:25.365]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:05:25.365 --> 00:05:27.666]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:05:39.438 --> 00:05:41.579]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:05:41.579 --> 00:05:43.379]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:46.260]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.501]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[00:05:50.501 --> 00:05:52.881]  So you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:05:52.881 --> 00:05:55.582]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:05:55.582 --> 00:05:57.162]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:05:57.162 --> 00:05:57.943]  Got it.
[00:05:57.943 --> 00:05:58.823]  Others don't.
[00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.683]  Have you ever wanted to give a gift that expresses faith and liberty?
[00:06:02.683 --> 00:06:05.525]  Those powerful beliefs that shaped our nation at its founding?
[00:06:05.525 --> 00:06:10.390]  If so, pay close attention because this may be the most important holiday message you'll hear this year.
[00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:12.332]  Beautiful Liberty Blankets are now available.
[00:06:12.332 --> 00:06:16.075]  The Liberty Blanket is made right here in the USA out of all-natural cotton.
[00:06:16.075 --> 00:06:17.577]  It's ultra-soft, ultra-warm,
[00:06:17.697 --> 00:06:23.503]  And designed to remind your friends and loved ones of the enduring values that won the battle for freedom in early America.
[00:06:23.503 --> 00:06:26.606]  The center of the Liberty Blanket has the words, Appeal to God.
[00:06:26.606 --> 00:06:32.953]  A phrase that Washington and the founders used often as they announced to the world that their rights and liberties came from a sovereign creator.
[00:06:32.953 --> 00:06:37.538]  And in each corner of the Liberty Blanket details one of the pillars of American freedom.
[00:06:37.538 --> 00:06:40.161]  Education, church, civil government and justice.
[00:06:40.421 --> 00:06:42.942]  Regularly $59.95, now just $39.95.
[00:06:42.942 --> 00:06:49.346]  It's the perfect Christmas gift that helps your friends and family remember our nation's most precious legacy.
[00:06:49.346 --> 00:06:52.348]  To order your Liberty Blanket, go to libertyblanket.com.

[00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:54.809]  That's 800-209-1258.
[00:07:01.058 --> 00:07:02.740]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:08.066]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:07:08.066 --> 00:07:09.608]  Saving means to make money.
[00:07:09.608 --> 00:07:18.378]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:07:19.119 --> 00:07:26.642]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:07:26.642 --> 00:07:34.646]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:07:34.646 --> 00:07:39.888]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[00:07:39.888 --> 00:07:42.049]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:48.031]  Or see Calvin on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[00:07:48.031 --> 00:07:51.032]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:07:51.032 --> 00:08:00.394]  Or see Calvin on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[00:08:00.394 --> 00:08:05.795]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:05.795 --> 00:08:08.076]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:10.902 --> 00:08:20.876]  Here we are, my friends, defending Basic Bill of Rights and Constitution, defending our Republic against enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:08:20.876 --> 00:08:24.401]  It is Wednesday, the 14th day of December, 2011.
[00:08:28.001 --> 00:08:31.764]  And we have another just incredibly important broadcast wind up.
[00:08:31.764 --> 00:08:42.493]  You know, I've tuned into older archives of 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 years ago, 10 years ago, 16 years ago, and I didn't start most broadcasts saying, a very important transmission today.
[00:08:42.493 --> 00:08:45.956]  And I said that sometimes, and it's always important.
[00:08:46.656 --> 00:08:53.001]  But now, who can deny the news just gets wilder and crazier every day.
[00:08:53.001 --> 00:08:56.903]  World developments are coming so quick.
[00:08:56.903 --> 00:09:13.095]  The world is in so much turmoil and upheaval and on the edge of major multi-region wars, they call those world wars by the way, that words really cannot describe how amazing what's happening is.
[00:09:13.095 --> 00:09:13.255]  Now,
[00:09:14.588 --> 00:09:17.830]  Let me just mention the news that's coming up.
[00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:18.831]  And you know I can never do this.
[00:09:18.831 --> 00:09:24.975]  I get into the first article and then basically stall out and start getting into that report.
[00:09:24.975 --> 00:09:26.656]  But let me just mention it here.
[00:09:26.656 --> 00:09:30.899]  New Haven mayor says give illegal aliens right to vote in city elections.
[00:09:30.899 --> 00:09:35.082]  That's also not just happening in Connecticut, but New York and New Jersey and California.
[00:09:35.082 --> 00:09:37.304]  And the Justice Department's behind it.
[00:09:37.304 --> 00:09:40.006]  And they're going to give all 30 million illegals the right to vote.
[00:09:40.836 --> 00:09:45.600]  And then the right to bring their entire family here, and it's a coup.
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:52.026]  And the illegals for welfare have said they will vote on average for total gun bans, private property being taken.
[00:09:52.026 --> 00:09:53.327]  The bankers checkmate.
[00:09:53.327 --> 00:09:55.208]  They've also tried this in Europe.
[00:09:55.208 --> 00:09:57.590]  The illegals get free health care.
[00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:02.054]  They get, on reports I've seen in Texas, more than half the school lunches are for illegals.
[00:10:02.054 --> 00:10:04.096]  It's two-thirds in California.
[00:10:04.096 --> 00:10:06.178]  The free welfare, all of it.
[00:10:06.838 --> 00:10:08.759]  And illegals know how to work the system.
[00:10:08.759 --> 00:10:11.320]  That actually, on average, I've seen the breakdowns.
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.441]  You can pull them up.
[00:10:12.441 --> 00:10:13.582]  The Justice Department admits it.
[00:10:13.582 --> 00:10:20.826]  They go out and do get jobs, and then go, under two or three aliases, and get welfare.
[00:10:20.826 --> 00:10:32.632]  And then, they're so entitled, and actually so filled with the victim psychology and a liberation theology by the Ford Foundation-run government, that they actually believe that they're entitled to more.
[00:10:33.649 --> 00:10:36.310]  And they're going to vote for it.
[00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:39.312]  And the big collectivist government is going to give it to them.
[00:10:39.312 --> 00:10:48.296]  And the paralyzed American population, no matter what color your race, color or creed is, you are to be nailed to the wall and sucked dry.
[00:10:48.296 --> 00:11:00.542]  And then the country will implode into third world destruction, and the illegals will have all their goodies cut off, and if they go out and protest, they'll be machine-gunned by the paramilitary police, just like they are in Mexico.
[00:11:02.449 --> 00:11:03.691]  And that's what's going on.
[00:11:03.691 --> 00:11:04.552]  Period.
[00:11:04.552 --> 00:11:06.215]  So I'm going to get into that.
[00:11:06.215 --> 00:11:11.764]  Again, here it is, NBC, New Haven, Ashe State, to allow non-citizens to vote.
[00:11:11.764 --> 00:11:15.190]  Criminals who get in-state tuition in most states.
[00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:16.813]  You don't have a big heart if you don't do that.
[00:11:17.998 --> 00:11:19.219]  I'm going to break this down more.
[00:11:19.219 --> 00:11:22.461]  Of course, I don't get to go to Mexico and say, can I have in-state tuition?
[00:11:22.461 --> 00:11:24.062]  I would be laughed at.
[00:11:24.062 --> 00:11:35.891]  The police would line me up, break my nose, and say, we're going to put you in jail, guero, gringo, and then we're going to take every bit of money out of your bank account and you're never leaving this prison.
[00:11:36.491 --> 00:11:39.332]  And our media wouldn't say a word, the State Department wouldn't say a word if they did.
[00:11:39.332 --> 00:11:43.013]  They'd say, that's what a piece of trash white person deserves.
[00:11:43.013 --> 00:11:46.534]  Of course they do it to Hispanic Americans as well, Asian, doesn't matter.
[00:11:46.534 --> 00:11:48.414]  Because we are trash.
[00:11:48.414 --> 00:11:51.715]  There is a belief that we are here to be walked on.
[00:11:51.715 --> 00:11:53.836]  Americans are the enemy.
[00:11:53.836 --> 00:11:55.096]  Americans are garbage.
[00:11:55.096 --> 00:11:58.757]  And the bankers have helped foster this idea and teach it in school.
[00:11:58.757 --> 00:12:00.998]  We're from Texas to California.
[00:12:02.017 --> 00:12:04.921]  You cannot wear an American flag on your shirt.
[00:12:04.921 --> 00:12:06.423]  You will be kicked out of school.
[00:12:06.423 --> 00:12:08.145]  Because it is offensive!
[00:12:08.145 --> 00:12:08.846]  And you're, okay?
[00:12:08.846 --> 00:12:10.949]  So, that's coming up.
[00:12:10.949 --> 00:12:14.073]  And again, it's all sold as humanitarianism!
[00:12:14.073 --> 00:12:15.294]  Humanitarianism!
[00:12:16.315 --> 00:12:16.795]  Here's another one.
[00:12:16.795 --> 00:12:21.979]  Wisconsin faces lawsuit as civil rights groups cry foul over new voting rules.
[00:12:21.979 --> 00:12:28.943]  ACLU accuses the state of trying to disenfranchise black people, the poor and elderly, by requiring photo ID before they can vote.
[00:12:28.943 --> 00:12:30.204]  Well, that's not enough.
[00:12:30.204 --> 00:12:34.387]  Here in Texas, they give illegals driver's license on record.
[00:12:34.387 --> 00:12:39.690]  I've had Art Acevedo in studio before, the police chief, saying, well, we need to be able to track these people and have them in the system.
[00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:42.112]  And with that, the bank account, everything.
[00:12:43.117 --> 00:12:45.979]  And again, no other country in the world does this.
[00:12:45.979 --> 00:12:48.441]  Total red carpet, and now what are people saying?
[00:12:48.441 --> 00:12:50.302]  This is Mexico.
[00:12:50.302 --> 00:12:51.163]  We're taking over.
[00:12:51.163 --> 00:12:52.124]  And who's teaching it?
[00:12:52.124 --> 00:12:53.465]  Fortune 100.
[00:12:53.465 --> 00:12:54.145]  Big banks.
[00:12:54.145 --> 00:12:54.966]  Who's pushing it?
[00:12:54.966 --> 00:12:58.148]  Because they want to break this country up.
[00:12:58.148 --> 00:13:00.450]  And we're right at the tipping point.
[00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:01.991]  Right as we go into bankruptcy.
[00:13:01.991 --> 00:13:03.232]  Right as we implode.
[00:13:03.232 --> 00:13:06.294]  Right as the narco-terrorism pours across the border.
[00:13:06.294 --> 00:13:06.975]  It's all happening.
[00:13:08.274 --> 00:13:20.860]  And as the government ships guns into Mexico, on record, as I told you two years ago, we even had a state senator on who had seen the secret documents at the state level, to have Mexico implode and use that to declare martial law on the Southwest.
[00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:23.982]  This is all a plan to destroy Mexico and the U.S.
[00:13:23.982 --> 00:13:25.502]  and Canada.
[00:13:25.502 --> 00:13:26.863]  People better figure this out.
[00:13:26.863 --> 00:13:30.805]  The globalists, the same ones that go in and kill a million Iraqis?
[00:13:30.805 --> 00:13:32.566]  Same ones that put Al-Qaeda in control of Libya?
[00:13:33.806 --> 00:13:35.827]  Same ones destabilizing Africa?
[00:13:35.827 --> 00:13:40.770]  The policy is destabilization and stopping countries from industrializing.
[00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:42.471]  That's the UN policy.
[00:13:42.471 --> 00:13:45.833]  That's the State Department memorandum 200 policy.
[00:13:45.833 --> 00:13:47.233]  It's order out of chaos.
[00:13:47.233 --> 00:13:50.895]  It's destroy everybody while playing us off against each other.
[00:13:50.895 --> 00:13:56.338]  And it's outrageous.
[00:13:56.338 --> 00:13:58.559]  Continuing here, I'm going to get into this report.
[00:13:58.559 --> 00:13:59.080]  Here it is.
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.601]  Obama hauls Arizona before UN Human Rights Council.
[00:14:01.601 --> 00:14:02.942]  Remember that from last year?
[00:14:05.714 --> 00:14:07.055]  This is the type of stuff.
[00:14:07.055 --> 00:14:13.741]  The feds won't enforce their own federal laws, and they won't let the states enforce laws, and total lawlessness is here.
[00:14:13.741 --> 00:14:15.823]  But wait, it gets worse, and I'll get into the big news.
[00:14:17.256 --> 00:14:31.781]  Of course, you heard on Monday, we reported on the LA Times article about Air Force Predator drones tracking citizens in rural areas under the North American Rural Council.
[00:14:31.781 --> 00:14:36.522]  We don't have 50 governors anymore, we have 10 governors appointed by FEMA.
[00:14:36.522 --> 00:14:41.244]  And under the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, it says for insurrection against the other states.
[00:14:41.244 --> 00:14:44.305]  But the Governor Council will speak, that they will arrest governors if need be.
[00:14:45.957 --> 00:14:53.800]  You saw it in Europe when the presidents and prime ministers wouldn't hand their country over and waive all their rights on debts they didn't owe.
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:58.982]  They were removed by the militaries quietly in places like Greece.
[00:14:58.982 --> 00:15:08.225]  The military was on standby and they put a Goldman Sachs operative, one of the former heads of the ECB, European Central Bank, in charge.
[00:15:08.225 --> 00:15:09.906]  Same thing in Italy.
[00:15:09.906 --> 00:15:11.166]  Same thing in Greece.
[00:15:11.166 --> 00:15:12.247]  And then they admit it.
[00:15:13.067 --> 00:15:14.128]  It's the same thing here.
[00:15:14.128 --> 00:15:25.260]  Northcom and our military individually are good people on average, but they're run by foreign banks publicly.
[00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.963]  And after they're done imploding Europe, you see Europe imploding.
[00:15:27.963 --> 00:15:29.345]  We told you that years ago.
[00:15:29.345 --> 00:15:29.945]  Who's next?
[00:15:30.885 --> 00:15:32.026]  Who's next?
[00:15:32.026 --> 00:15:34.188]  Everybody says Asia's invincible and going to fall.
[00:15:34.188 --> 00:15:40.114]  The globalists are going to bring Asia down, while bringing us down a little slower, and then North America's last.
[00:15:40.114 --> 00:15:41.916]  And boy, it's going to be bad.
[00:15:41.916 --> 00:15:43.798]  It's going to be real bad.
[00:15:43.798 --> 00:15:53.627]  And the open announcement of world government run by six megabanks with Goldman Sachs as the commander.
[00:15:53.627 --> 00:15:55.008]  I liken it to the frontline
[00:15:56.187 --> 00:16:03.228]  Field Marshal or the Darth Vader to the Emperor Palpatine is JPMorgan Chase, who they literally take their orders from.
[00:16:03.228 --> 00:16:03.548]  That's it.
[00:16:03.548 --> 00:16:04.449]  You want to know the New World Order?
[00:16:04.449 --> 00:16:06.229]  Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan.
[00:16:06.229 --> 00:16:07.349]  Want to know who owns it?
[00:16:07.349 --> 00:16:11.150]  Rockefellers, Rothschilds, Queen of England, Queen of the Netherlands.
[00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:12.830]  Publicly.
[00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:14.711]  You want to know who wants open borders?
[00:16:14.711 --> 00:16:15.031]  They do.
[00:16:15.031 --> 00:16:16.591]  You want to know who wants your guns?
[00:16:16.591 --> 00:16:17.811]  They do.
[00:16:17.811 --> 00:16:22.072]  And again, you can't argue with the fact these illegals, now already voting all over the country,
[00:16:23.171 --> 00:16:28.313]  The state of Texas is like, OK, we're going to need to check citizenship, you know, with the I.D.
[00:16:28.313 --> 00:16:29.233]  before you can vote.
[00:16:29.233 --> 00:16:31.394]  And the Justice Department was here yesterday.
[00:16:31.394 --> 00:16:39.177]  The guy that ships guns into Mexico to kill thousands, the guy that ships cocaine to the U.S., the mastermind of Oklahoma City, he's here.
[00:16:39.177 --> 00:16:40.838]  And he says, we may bring the U.N.
[00:16:40.838 --> 00:16:43.379]  in and we're going to stop the state from checking.
[00:16:43.379 --> 00:16:47.581]  I mean, this is the treason of these people, admitted criminals.
[00:16:49.448 --> 00:16:52.650]  But don't worry, the military is for you, the American people.
[00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:53.931]  In fact, we can pull this up on screen.
[00:16:53.931 --> 00:16:56.252]  It'd be great to show PrisonPlanet.tv viewers this.
[00:16:56.252 --> 00:17:03.537]  Radio listeners, just type in, meet the North Dakota family of anti-government separatists busted by cops using a Predator drone.
[00:17:05.123 --> 00:17:10.247]  After, quote, stealing six cows, and people are commenting in this story correctly.
[00:17:10.247 --> 00:17:12.909]  They are getting it right.
[00:17:12.909 --> 00:17:15.811]  They are understanding exactly what's going on.
[00:17:15.811 --> 00:17:22.917]  The commenters are like, all over the United States in state law and common law, if people's cows come onto your property, you own them.
[00:17:25.051 --> 00:17:29.135]  And that goes back to the damage they cause and the trouble and you're not keeping your fences up.
[00:17:29.135 --> 00:17:31.717]  That's an old common law thing of possession being nine-tenths.
[00:17:31.717 --> 00:17:47.751]  So the police show up and demand to be let onto the property and the family says no and the family gets all upset and reportedly had firearms in their vehicles so they call in the Air Force and the drone
[00:17:50.137 --> 00:17:57.286]  And Homeland Security and it tracks the evil family who are anti-government and the SWAT team raids them.
[00:17:57.286 --> 00:17:57.526]  Again.
[00:17:59.275 --> 00:18:01.737]  All sorts of crime, all sorts of corruption.
[00:18:01.737 --> 00:18:04.099]  The Houston Chronicle reported, what was it, four years ago?
[00:18:04.099 --> 00:18:10.444]  That a quarter million illegal aliens were released in Texas in one year out of the jails.
[00:18:10.444 --> 00:18:16.728]  Many of which were aggravated felons that listed arson, rape, armed robbery, all of it.
[00:18:16.728 --> 00:18:19.230]  And they were released.
[00:18:20.231 --> 00:18:22.152]  They were released.
[00:18:22.152 --> 00:18:23.914]  Oh, but don't worry.
[00:18:23.914 --> 00:18:27.016]  The North Dakota family, if you put the article up on screen, you can scroll down.
[00:18:27.016 --> 00:18:30.498]  We can see these evil people who, by the way, didn't have any criminal record.
[00:18:30.498 --> 00:18:35.661]  These evil people who said, look, there are cows that keep busting to the fence and coming over here.
[00:18:35.661 --> 00:18:40.665]  They have a 3000 acre farm and the cows keep eating their their their farm vegetables.
[00:18:40.665 --> 00:18:43.126]  And that's where under law you can take them.
[00:18:43.126 --> 00:18:49.991]  Quite frankly, my grandfather had some bulls that would jump fences and the neighbor after a couple of times went ahead and took them.
[00:18:51.672 --> 00:18:54.113]  And my grandfather never even went and asked for him.
[00:18:54.113 --> 00:18:54.413]  He knew.
[00:18:54.413 --> 00:18:56.394]  He said, the neighbor doesn't offer to give him back.
[00:18:56.394 --> 00:18:56.894]  I understand.
[00:18:56.894 --> 00:18:58.354]  I need to fix that fence.
[00:18:58.354 --> 00:19:01.135]  But nowadays, well, you just call in the predator drone.
[00:19:01.135 --> 00:19:03.216]  How many millions of dollars does that cost?
[00:19:03.216 --> 00:19:15.781]  Again, because they've passed in the Senate, we've got, now they're trying to pass it tomorrow in the House, in the conference, before it goes to Lord Obama's desk, the NDAA, the National Defense Authorization Act.
[00:19:15.781 --> 00:19:16.622]  And when we come back,
[00:19:18.126 --> 00:19:19.166]  I'm going to get into that.
[00:19:19.166 --> 00:19:26.488]  Forty members of House protest indefinite detention bill, and we reportedly have until tomorrow, because the House already passed one version, the Senate did.
[00:19:26.488 --> 00:19:32.889]  Now it's in conference, they're looking at both pieces of it and trying to integrate it, and then it'll go to the President.
[00:19:32.889 --> 00:19:36.209]  We need to say no to this.
[00:19:36.209 --> 00:19:44.691]  And by the way, now you've got the Senators who've been involved in it, Graham, McCain,
[00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:51.332]  And others coming out and saying, yes, it affects citizens and Obama!
[00:19:51.332 --> 00:19:53.873]  Here's the memo, asked it be added, that it be for U.S.
[00:19:53.873 --> 00:19:55.754]  citizens.
[00:19:55.754 --> 00:19:56.114]  You see?
[00:19:56.114 --> 00:19:58.676]  All the ACLU tells you, Obama's against it.
[00:20:01.081 --> 00:20:04.622]  Smokers, are you still smoking traditional cigarettes?
[00:20:04.622 --> 00:20:10.644]  Are you still smelling up your clothes and car interior, staining your teeth, and getting ashes everywhere?
[00:20:10.644 --> 00:20:11.284]  Why?
[00:20:11.284 --> 00:20:15.625]  When you can be smoking or vaping with e-cigarettes by Le Cig.

[00:21:16.122 --> 00:21:28.384]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:28.384 --> 00:21:35.325]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:21:35.325 --> 00:21:41.126]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold before your retirement.
[00:21:41.126 --> 00:21:44.507]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[00:23:30.735 --> 00:23:35.779]  That's the sound of your door being kicked in by an intruder with a single kick.
[00:23:35.779 --> 00:23:41.103]  That's the sound of the same door now protected by the Door Sentinel at MySafeDoor.com.

[00:23:56.515 --> 00:23:58.056]  That's MySafeDoor.com.
[00:24:03.939 --> 00:24:09.682]  By the way, again, most of the family living on this farm there in North Dakota didn't have a criminal record.
[00:24:09.682 --> 00:24:14.724]  The dad gets arrested for, you know, the checkpoints for not having his papers in order.
[00:24:14.724 --> 00:24:21.567]  And they had arrested him for not reporting the stray cattle that came onto your property.
[00:24:21.567 --> 00:24:22.948]  And I've looked up the North Dakota law.
[00:24:22.948 --> 00:24:25.669]  It's the same all over the country.
[00:24:25.669 --> 00:24:26.989]  He didn't have to give the cattle back.
[00:24:26.989 --> 00:24:27.890]  They came on his property.
[00:24:28.783 --> 00:24:29.864]  On his farm.
[00:24:29.864 --> 00:24:32.825]  Anybody who's been involved in farming and ranching knows this.
[00:24:32.825 --> 00:24:38.528]  So they show up without warrants, demand their way onto the property, and that's when...
[00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:43.312]  The family said, no, you don't have a warrant, get out of here.
[00:24:43.312 --> 00:24:51.881]  So they summoned the $154 million MQ-9 Predator B drone from nearby Grand Forks Air Force Base.
[00:24:51.881 --> 00:24:57.006]  And it's got the cops, and they're going, we got great intelligence from the military.
[00:24:57.006 --> 00:24:58.767]  Intelligence on us, I know.
[00:24:58.767 --> 00:24:59.748]  You're dinner.
[00:24:59.748 --> 00:25:01.710]  You're slaves, I understand.
[00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:02.431]  Don't worry, though.
[00:25:02.431 --> 00:25:05.174]  The whole country's going to collapse, just like you parasites want.
[00:25:05.834 --> 00:25:06.355]  Okay?
[00:25:06.355 --> 00:25:07.836]  It's all gonna fall apart.
[00:25:07.836 --> 00:25:10.800]  Your whole family's future, you're gonna be judged by your own evil.
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:12.521]  And it's gonna be like a third world country.
[00:25:12.521 --> 00:25:15.545]  There'll be nothing for you to suck off of anymore.
[00:25:15.545 --> 00:25:17.747]  No matter how rich this country was.
[00:25:17.747 --> 00:25:24.434]  And the articles are all, they lived on the 3,000 acre family farm the police call a compound.
[00:25:24.434 --> 00:25:26.477]  Because they had different houses on it.
[00:25:27.157 --> 00:25:34.603]  Oh my gosh, the father and his wife and the three sons and some of their wives live there, farming!
[00:25:34.603 --> 00:25:48.312]  And of course we had an ADL report yesterday we covered on the nightly news and Paul Watson wrote about it at Infowars.com, a secret meeting with citizens and the Sheriff's Department about small government terrorists.
[00:25:48.312 --> 00:25:53.096]  And the manual says if people are talking about small government, report them, they're terrorists!
[00:25:53.536 --> 00:25:58.119]  They're these people that believe in freedom and private property and guns!
[00:25:58.119 --> 00:25:59.880]  They've got tractors!
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:00.981]  They know how to grow things!
[00:26:00.981 --> 00:26:02.322]  They've got guns!
[00:26:02.322 --> 00:26:03.423]  Homeland Security!
[00:26:03.423 --> 00:26:05.104]  ADL!
[00:26:05.104 --> 00:26:05.884]  Save me!
[00:26:05.884 --> 00:26:07.345]  In fact, I covered that on the Nightly News.
[00:26:07.345 --> 00:26:09.887]  Will you guys reprint me that article?
[00:26:09.887 --> 00:26:16.352]  Headline, Secret Sheriff's Meeting for Small Government Terrorists.
[00:26:16.352 --> 00:26:18.213]  And it's got the manual right there on the article.
[00:26:19.462 --> 00:26:22.424]  There's these people, they want small government.
[00:26:22.424 --> 00:26:26.827]  The ADL's like, oh, law enforcement, the citizens are there at the secret meeting.
[00:26:26.827 --> 00:26:28.548]  Sheriff, how do we deal with these people?
[00:26:28.548 --> 00:26:31.750]  They're talking to neighbors.
[00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:34.012]  They say they have a right to freedom.
[00:26:34.012 --> 00:26:34.913]  Get them!
[00:26:34.913 --> 00:26:38.255]  Get them!
[00:26:38.255 --> 00:26:41.077]  Oh, ADL, Foreign Intelligence Operation of Israel.
[00:26:41.077 --> 00:26:43.198]  What do we do about these evil Americans?
[00:26:43.198 --> 00:26:46.120]  I mean, that's what this country has become.
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:47.641]  And you read this article, meet them.
[00:26:48.669 --> 00:26:57.277]  Brossards, a North Dakota family deemed so dangerous the local sheriff needed to unleash an unmanned predator drone to help bring them in.
[00:26:57.277 --> 00:27:05.025]  The Brossards allege crime they wouldn't give back three cows and their calves that wandered onto their 3,000 acre farm this summer.
[00:27:06.209 --> 00:27:17.817]  The same aerial vehicles used by the CIA to track down and assassinate terrorists and militants in Pakistan and Afghanistan are now being deployed by cops to spy on Americans in their own backyards.
[00:27:17.817 --> 00:27:19.958]  But don't videotape a cop in public!
[00:27:19.958 --> 00:27:25.542]  They'll have a pick-cat jury put your butt in prison for life, or they'll sure try.
[00:27:25.542 --> 00:27:27.023]  Prison for life!
[00:27:27.023 --> 00:27:30.105]  And they'll sit there with a straight face and tell the judge, I want them to go to prison.
[00:27:30.105 --> 00:27:32.026]  The judge is like, you bet we want them to.
[00:27:32.026 --> 00:27:35.649]  What do you think, in America you're going to videotape us in the city street?
[00:27:36.609 --> 00:27:41.953]  You don't do nothing but pay our salary, slave!
[00:27:41.953 --> 00:27:57.345]  Continuing here with the article that goes on, the brossards of the first known suspects of the high-flying new surveillance technology the federal government has made available to some local sheriffs and police chiefs, all without congressional approval or search warrants.
[00:27:57.345 --> 00:28:02.589]  We don't need no stinking congressional approval to launch wars or shut down coal-powered plants or
[00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:04.311]  Have U.N.
[00:28:04.311 --> 00:28:08.574]  oversee elections, do whatever we want, or kill U.S.
[00:28:08.574 --> 00:28:08.934]  citizens.
[00:28:08.934 --> 00:28:09.674]  That's what Obama said.
[00:28:09.674 --> 00:28:11.235]  I don't need to sign your bill.
[00:28:11.235 --> 00:28:13.717]  But if you're going to pass it, you better add American citizens in there.
[00:28:13.717 --> 00:28:16.659]  Republicans are like, you bet we hate them as much as you do.
[00:28:16.659 --> 00:28:17.540]  He's like, good job.
[00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:18.401]  Keep conning them.
[00:28:18.401 --> 00:28:20.142]  Keep acting like we're fighting with each other.
[00:28:20.142 --> 00:28:21.783]  Try to get that Ringer Genrich in there.
[00:28:21.783 --> 00:28:22.664]  How's that sound?
[00:28:22.664 --> 00:28:24.605]  They're like, you bet we'll get that job done.
[00:28:24.605 --> 00:28:26.666]  I'm going to play like I'm against it, though.
[00:28:26.666 --> 00:28:28.728]  They're like, that's a good way to fool the slaves.
[00:28:28.728 --> 00:28:29.849]  Ha ha ha, yeah.
[00:28:30.629 --> 00:28:32.852]  I mean, they just know exactly what they're doing.
[00:28:32.852 --> 00:28:41.641]  And you've got all your excuses of why you do all this, and why you need all the surveillance, and violate our rights, how it's all for the good of America.
[00:28:41.641 --> 00:28:45.285]  Everybody knows in their gut, it's pure baloney.
[00:28:45.285 --> 00:28:46.727]  Okay?
[00:28:46.727 --> 00:28:49.290]  Everybody knows, and it's going to get ten times worse.
[00:28:51.676 --> 00:28:53.517]  Local authorities, not servants.
[00:28:53.517 --> 00:28:56.559]  Authorities say that the family are known for being armed.
[00:28:56.559 --> 00:29:00.541]  Oh my God, farmers that are armed!
[00:29:00.541 --> 00:29:04.084]  Anti-government separatists who sprawling farm.
[00:29:04.084 --> 00:29:05.244]  Oh, that's really evil.
[00:29:05.244 --> 00:29:08.126]  Remember what the entire Homeland Security Behind the Closed Doors training is?
[00:29:08.126 --> 00:29:09.027]  We've got the manuals.
[00:29:09.027 --> 00:29:11.708]  It's all about country boys that can survive.
[00:29:11.708 --> 00:29:15.531]  If you can skin a buck and run a trot line, the Pentagon... I've been to the drills.
[00:29:15.531 --> 00:29:16.711]  I've made films.
[00:29:16.711 --> 00:29:21.094]  And let me tell you, they're training to take on farmers and ranchers and people wearing John Deere hats.
[00:29:21.254 --> 00:29:21.734]  In the drills.
[00:29:37.409 --> 00:29:38.130]  You think I'm joking?
[00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:39.331]  This isn't satire.
[00:29:39.331 --> 00:29:48.719]  I got footage of cops pulling people over, they've got to sue some rule book, and they start heavy breathing and have to rest on the car in fear, going, I can't believe we found one, boss!
[00:29:48.719 --> 00:29:51.181]  I can't believe we found... We're on the march.
[00:29:51.181 --> 00:29:53.703]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.703 --> 00:29:56.386]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.764 --> 00:30:05.788]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:30:05.788 --> 00:30:09.032]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:30:09.032 --> 00:30:13.837]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:30:13.837 --> 00:30:20.224]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:30:20.224 --> 00:30:22.467]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:30:22.987 --> 00:30:23.307]  Tim Geithner?
[00:30:23.307 --> 00:30:23.807]  Bernanke?
[00:30:23.807 --> 00:30:24.488]  They're arsonists!
[00:30:24.488 --> 00:30:25.728]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:30:25.728 --> 00:30:28.009]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:30:41.894 --> 00:30:46.276]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[00:30:46.276 --> 00:30:49.177]  we have seen a fall of the republic.

[00:32:00.237 --> 00:32:01.418]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:32:01.418 --> 00:32:08.366]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:32:08.366 --> 00:32:10.909]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:32:10.909 --> 00:32:16.295]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:32:16.295 --> 00:32:19.339]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:32:19.339 --> 00:32:21.401]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:32:21.641 --> 00:32:27.906]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:32:27.906 --> 00:32:31.268]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:32:31.268 --> 00:32:37.053]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:32:37.053 --> 00:32:38.694]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:32:38.694 --> 00:32:39.995]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:32:39.995 --> 00:32:42.677]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:32:42.677 --> 00:32:46.900]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:48.942]  You can find the video at www.
[00:32:49.682 --> 00:32:51.504]  End of America 3.com.
[00:32:51.504 --> 00:32:52.644]  That's End of America.

[00:33:03.893 --> 00:33:06.195]  Mainstream media.
[00:33:06.195 --> 00:33:07.997]  Government cover-ups.
[00:33:07.997 --> 00:33:10.098]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:33:10.098 --> 00:33:12.240]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:16.944]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:18.766 --> 00:33:22.131]  Alright, Max Keiser is going to be with us about 15-20 minutes in the next hour.
[00:33:22.131 --> 00:33:33.287]  He's going to join us here in about 5 minutes and then go right through in the next hour and we're going to open the phones up next hour for Max and then continuing into the third hour when a former East German colonel, Army colonel...
[00:33:34.328 --> 00:33:38.611]  Uh, who's part of Oath Keepers is going to be here to join us in studio.
[00:33:38.611 --> 00:33:46.696]  He lives here in Texas now, uh, to, uh, break down the horrors of, uh, collectivism and, and the, and the police state.
[00:33:46.696 --> 00:33:51.380]  They hired Marcus Wolf, uh, eight years ago to help set up what is Homeland Security today.
[00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:52.260]  He's since died.
[00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:54.902]  He was the former head of the Stasi.
[00:33:54.902 --> 00:33:57.183]  And when I first saw that in the news, I didn't believe it.
[00:33:57.183 --> 00:34:03.488]  I actually went to the congressional Homeland Security funding numbers and he was paid over a million a year.
[00:34:04.188 --> 00:34:09.810]  For at least three years consecutively after that to help set up everything.
[00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:16.231]  That's why you're like, wow, it's just like the Stasi, you know, the biggest police state ever known in East Germany.
[00:34:16.231 --> 00:34:18.652]  It was kind of like the Nazis merged with communism.
[00:34:18.652 --> 00:34:20.912]  Talk about a nightmare situation.
[00:34:20.912 --> 00:34:23.633]  And that's because that's what it is.
[00:34:23.633 --> 00:34:27.034]  Now, if you heard me ranting there, it's because I'm in a lot of pain.
[00:34:27.034 --> 00:34:28.695]  I mean, it's all coming true.
[00:34:28.695 --> 00:34:29.975]  I know where this goes next.
[00:34:30.575 --> 00:34:35.998]  I've got chills now every five seconds, not every, you know, two weeks or something.
[00:34:35.998 --> 00:34:37.519]  I'm having bad chills right now.
[00:34:37.519 --> 00:34:44.262]  Chills of my body saying, danger Will Robinson, danger.
[00:34:44.262 --> 00:34:47.504]  And I know how they slowly have trained the police and military to accept all this.
[00:34:48.547 --> 00:34:53.791]  And now they're rolling out the use of Northcom against the people right as they get ready to start imploding the world economy.
[00:34:53.791 --> 00:34:55.212]  You think things are bad so far?
[00:34:55.212 --> 00:34:56.933]  This is just the preparatory phase.
[00:34:56.933 --> 00:35:01.856]  We'll put on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers an article that went up yesterday evening.
[00:35:01.856 --> 00:35:15.947]  That's a problem with Infowars.com as we write so much and do so much research that there's updates at 6am, 10am or so, noon, 2 o'clock, 4 o'clock, 6 o'clock, and Watson tends to be working at midnight over in England which is 6 o'clock here.
[00:35:16.887 --> 00:35:22.491]  Central, and that's when that article went up was later in the afternoon, his time, our time, night time, his time.
[00:35:22.491 --> 00:35:23.471]  It didn't get much attention.
[00:35:23.471 --> 00:35:24.392]  It's big.
[00:35:24.392 --> 00:35:28.095]  Sheriff's Department sponsors secret meeting on small government terrorists.
[00:35:28.095 --> 00:35:37.000]  We've got the ADL training manual there with the mayors and the local constabulary to literally make them feel like they're part of the authority system.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.102]  And they sit there with straight face and bad mouth.
[00:35:40.102 --> 00:35:43.605]  People that talk about cutting government in any way are what they call
[00:35:44.875 --> 00:36:00.128]  Terrorist and we can click on it and actually show you the manual there that the ADL gives them and I see this in our local news the ADL is advising police and schools And then you find out they're training the school kids to spy on their parents and stuff.
[00:36:00.128 --> 00:36:09.996]  I mean it's so over-the-top That this is going on investigative researcher and director of special projects ADL
[00:36:11.127 --> 00:36:14.470]  Location, Carmelo, California.
[00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:21.596]  The Sovereign Citizen Movement is a loosely organized collection of groups and individuals who have adopted a right-wing, anarchist ideology.
[00:36:21.596 --> 00:36:22.616]  You mean they're not slaves?
[00:36:22.616 --> 00:36:24.198]  You mean they're like the Founders?
[00:36:24.198 --> 00:36:33.425]  Its adherents believe that virtually all existing government in the United States is illegitimate and they seek to restore an idealized, minimalist government that never actually existed.
[00:36:33.425 --> 00:36:33.866]  Oh, really?
[00:36:35.589 --> 00:36:39.314]  Sovereign citizens wage war against the government and other forms of authority.
[00:36:39.314 --> 00:36:45.441]  Yeah, info war, using paper terrorism, you pro se, winning all... Oh, let's stop right there.
[00:36:45.441 --> 00:36:47.043]  You know, I just... And we're about to go to Max Keiser.
[00:36:48.271 --> 00:36:58.634]  I remember 16 years ago, pro se people, lawyers who'd woken up and others coming to me and saying, there aren't real mortgages.
[00:36:58.634 --> 00:36:59.495]  It's illegal.
[00:36:59.495 --> 00:37:01.735]  They put them in an electronic filing system.
[00:37:01.735 --> 00:37:03.576]  This mirror system is illegal.
[00:37:03.576 --> 00:37:05.977]  They're selling them in derivatives.
[00:37:05.977 --> 00:37:08.597]  And I had to go research it because it sounded so crazy.
[00:37:08.597 --> 00:37:12.099]  And George Humphrey, an economist, former city council guy, he told me about it.
[00:37:12.099 --> 00:37:16.240]  But I remember ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center stuff just three years ago.
[00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:24.407]  Saying there are crazy people that claim the mortgages have been sold over and over again and that they're taking houses that they don't have mortgages to.
[00:37:24.407 --> 00:37:25.628]  It is paper terrorism.
[00:37:25.628 --> 00:37:29.692]  And I remember seeing articles where in one case it was Wisconsin.
[00:37:29.692 --> 00:37:31.855]  I forget because I had the guy's wife on.
[00:37:31.855 --> 00:37:34.777]  He's since gone to jail and been real sick in there.
[00:37:34.777 --> 00:37:36.219]  But the point is I forget his name.
[00:37:36.219 --> 00:37:37.260]  We need to pull it up.
[00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:38.101]  He was in a wheelchair.
[00:37:38.681 --> 00:37:49.569]  And they took his house that was paid for, threw this fraud, and when he sued them over it, they arrested him, charged him with some paper terrorism thing, because the judges and everybody are so evil.
[00:37:49.569 --> 00:37:52.872]  And he went to jail, I think it was for 14 years.
[00:37:52.872 --> 00:37:56.855]  Anyways, I just had another remembrance here of just how evil it is.
[00:37:56.855 --> 00:37:59.117]  And they sit there, but see, now it doesn't work.
[00:38:00.708 --> 00:38:02.029]  But do the cops remember?
[00:38:02.029 --> 00:38:03.889]  I know there's cops all over the country listening.
[00:38:03.889 --> 00:38:12.133]  Do you remember just three or four years ago and before that being taught these dangerous crazies claim the mortgages are a fraud and they don't owe them?
[00:38:12.133 --> 00:38:13.573]  You know, that's how they lie to you.
[00:38:13.573 --> 00:38:16.294]  They say that you don't owe anything on your mortgage.
[00:38:16.294 --> 00:38:17.034]  Aren't they crazy?
[00:38:17.034 --> 00:38:19.395]  And the cops, I've got training videos of it, all go...
[00:38:21.847 --> 00:38:22.628]  We've aired them here.
[00:38:22.628 --> 00:38:24.330]  They are nuts!
[00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:28.113]  The banks wouldn't take houses they didn't have the deed to!
[00:38:28.113 --> 00:38:29.514]  That's crazy!
[00:38:29.514 --> 00:38:33.058]  Now it's all over thousands of newspapers admit it.
[00:38:33.058 --> 00:38:36.060]  We knew what we were talking about again!
[00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:42.967]  Now are there people out there who try to investigate the law themselves and don't know what they're filing or how they're filing it or kooky groups that
[00:38:43.991 --> 00:38:47.132]  You know, file bonds and demand $10 million from the government.
[00:38:47.132 --> 00:38:55.294]  Yeah, there's some of that, but the vast majority of it is real and legitimate, and it's people, even in their own manuals, they say that are losing everything and who are desperate.
[00:38:55.294 --> 00:38:56.594]  I mean, what are you supposed to do?
[00:38:56.594 --> 00:39:00.555]  They're coming to take your little house, your little farm, but you can't pay the property taxes?
[00:39:00.555 --> 00:39:03.836]  They're just gonna give it to some big bank that you've already bailed out with your tax money and it happens?
[00:39:03.836 --> 00:39:05.297]  Alright, we're going to Max Keiser.
[00:39:05.297 --> 00:39:06.437]  The point is, is that
[00:39:07.648 --> 00:39:08.629]  It's all happening.
[00:39:08.629 --> 00:39:09.629]  It's all coming down.
[00:39:09.629 --> 00:39:20.715]  And as they squeeze and squeeze and squeeze, and as 11% of Texas has arrest warrants out for them, and as the government can engage in any crime they want, I mean, look at that quote right there.
[00:39:20.715 --> 00:39:23.656]  Look at that quote right there.
[00:39:23.656 --> 00:39:26.117]  Where they said they believe the government's illegitimate.
[00:39:26.117 --> 00:39:28.658]  Well, the founders did the Declaration of Independence.
[00:39:28.658 --> 00:39:34.882]  Everything that the British government was doing is exactly what our government is doing, but more.
[00:39:34.882 --> 00:39:35.442]  Our government
[00:39:37.662 --> 00:39:45.187]  He is shipping guns into Mexico and drugs back into the country and it's in all the federal filings and was finally in the New York Times two Sundays ago.
[00:39:45.187 --> 00:39:46.769]  Our government's caught perjuring itself.
[00:39:46.769 --> 00:39:50.591]  Our government's been caught running white slavery, sex slavery worldwide.
[00:39:50.591 --> 00:39:51.252]  Mainstream news.
[00:39:51.252 --> 00:40:06.523]  I mean, the British were doing all sorts of corrupt stuff and insider deals and taxes and things, but they weren't giving 10,000 guns to the Indians to then attack their own settlers, to take the settlers' guns.
[00:40:08.151 --> 00:40:12.153]  I mean, you read the Declaration of Independence, everything they list, the government's doing today.
[00:40:12.153 --> 00:40:12.833]  Go read it.
[00:40:12.833 --> 00:40:14.754]  But then more!
[00:40:14.754 --> 00:40:16.515]  I mean, was Hitler illegitimate?
[00:40:16.515 --> 00:40:18.896]  You know, they had a big debate in Philadelphia a month ago.
[00:40:18.896 --> 00:40:23.538]  The BBC headline was, is the Declaration of Independence illegal?
[00:40:23.538 --> 00:40:33.442]  And they actually had newspapers in the US come out and say, no, and agree, it's illegal, as the BBC said, because you're not allowed to tell a sovereign government it's ever wrong.
[00:40:33.442 --> 00:40:35.783]  Really, then Stalin, Mao, Hitler, they were all good.
[00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:38.667]  Caligula was good.
[00:40:38.667 --> 00:40:39.892]  Every monster's been good.
[00:40:40.987 --> 00:40:42.848]  No, we all know that's not the case.
[00:40:42.848 --> 00:40:45.110]  And so, yes, you are illegitimate.
[00:40:45.110 --> 00:40:52.496]  The government has given 27 plus trillion dollars of our tax money to mega-banks that sold fraudulent derivatives.
[00:40:52.496 --> 00:40:54.177]  Our country is run by these banks.
[00:40:54.177 --> 00:40:56.019]  Europe is publicly run by them now.
[00:40:56.019 --> 00:40:57.320]  It's illegitimate.
[00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:04.646]  And so the ADL's running around everywhere teaching the police that we're terrorists because we're telling people this and that our words are terrorism?
[00:41:04.646 --> 00:41:07.828]  Okay, I'm going to stop right there and I apologize to Max for having him hold eight minutes.
[00:41:07.828 --> 00:41:08.709]  I'm going to go to him now.
[00:41:08.709 --> 00:41:09.930]  I just had to get to that.
[00:41:11.175 --> 00:41:13.228]  Coming up after Max leaves us, uh, 20...
[00:41:17.469 --> 00:41:17.809]  What is it?
[00:41:17.809 --> 00:41:22.993]  There's something like 20 senators that are concerned now and before that it was only seven that voted against it.
[00:41:22.993 --> 00:41:29.917]  There's a total of 40 members of Congress are protesting indefinite detention bill and it's in conference right now.
[00:41:29.917 --> 00:41:32.259]  The House is set to pass it tomorrow.
[00:41:32.259 --> 00:41:36.662]  It's now admitted that Obama had it added in there while claiming he was against it.
[00:41:36.662 --> 00:41:38.923]  I mean, that's the kind of stuff Rick Perry does.
[00:41:38.923 --> 00:41:40.324]  So all of that's going on.
[00:41:40.324 --> 00:41:43.226]  We just have incredible information coming up.
[00:41:43.226 --> 00:41:46.969]  But I wanted to get Max Keiser up to get his perspective.
[00:41:48.819 --> 00:41:49.119]  on this.
[00:41:49.119 --> 00:41:54.022]  Then we've got some other bombshell gun control, gun grabbing news going on.
[00:41:54.022 --> 00:41:59.686]  But before we do that, I just want to preface here and then go to Max and play the video clip.
[00:41:59.686 --> 00:42:01.707]  This is out of the Financial Times of London.
[00:42:01.707 --> 00:42:04.369]  I saw it last night at Zero Hedge.
[00:42:04.369 --> 00:42:07.511]  We had it up at InfoWars.com.
[00:42:07.511 --> 00:42:12.073]  CME chief alleges Corzine aware of transfers.
[00:42:12.073 --> 00:42:17.757]  Now, they had prepared at the big commodities exchange group, the old mercantile out of Chicago,
[00:42:19.361 --> 00:42:34.570]  They had prepared, to put this in layman's terms, and then we'll get Max Keiser's expert take on it, a prepared statement for the head of the CME Group, who had said that everything that was going on in the commodities was insured, on record.
[00:42:34.570 --> 00:42:37.432]  And now they're talking about $1.2 to $3 billion missing.
[00:42:37.432 --> 00:42:39.753]  First it was $600 million, then $900 million.
[00:42:39.753 --> 00:42:43.656]  And that's back in the USA today, and they're saying it's at least $1.2 billion or more today.
[00:42:45.188 --> 00:42:56.011]  Corzine's been to two different committees, he's got one more, he gets up there and says, I know nothing as the CEO, I don't know where the money went, and I never said take it, and no one knows where it went, as if the government doesn't know where the transfers went.
[00:42:56.011 --> 00:42:58.032]  It's reportedly JP Morgan, that came out.
[00:42:58.032 --> 00:43:00.653]  But it's just like, everybody plays dumb.
[00:43:00.653 --> 00:43:02.073]  And he says, I know nothing like Sgt.
[00:43:02.073 --> 00:43:04.594]  Schultz and Hogan's Heroes, but it's people's money.
[00:43:04.594 --> 00:43:05.994]  Farmers, ranchers, and others.
[00:43:05.994 --> 00:43:08.655]  You know, the terrorists the drones are training to take out?
[00:43:09.514 --> 00:43:12.155]  That's why they got GPS coordinates to all your front doors?
[00:43:12.155 --> 00:43:14.195]  I've talked to people in the Pentagon, and it's come out.
[00:43:14.195 --> 00:43:17.556]  It is to send missiles into your house.
[00:43:17.556 --> 00:43:19.536]  People a year ago were like, that's crazy.
[00:43:19.536 --> 00:43:21.256]  Now you're learning!
[00:43:21.256 --> 00:43:22.637]  Again.
[00:43:22.637 --> 00:43:30.158]  So the CME had its prepared text, and I have that up at InfoWars.com.
[00:43:30.158 --> 00:43:34.919]  Here's the headline, presenting the three unscripted sentences that may have cost Corzine his freedom.
[00:43:35.953 --> 00:43:43.395]  And the head of the CME Group is saying he was in on the meetings and that he was told Corzine was the one that ordered the money to be transferred out.
[00:43:43.395 --> 00:43:45.096]  I'm going to play the clip in a moment.
[00:43:45.096 --> 00:43:46.396]  It's all in lawyer speak.
[00:43:46.396 --> 00:43:47.596]  But this is a big deal.
[00:43:47.596 --> 00:43:56.919]  This is the big fat CME Group rat who was attacking Gerald Cilente and others just three weeks ago and saying we're nuts.
[00:43:57.759 --> 00:44:01.343]  He is now, he's not going to go to prison for lying to Congress.
[00:44:01.343 --> 00:44:02.204]  Why should he?
[00:44:02.204 --> 00:44:04.187]  When it's Corzine, why should he lie for Corzine?
[00:44:04.187 --> 00:44:08.592]  So the rats, just like in the Justice Department on Fast and Furious, are turning on each other.
[00:44:08.592 --> 00:44:14.098]  Now the question is, will they just say, well he doesn't matter if he ordered it and has been caught lying as if we don't know he ordered it.
[00:44:14.699 --> 00:44:17.762]  Go ahead and let Corzine, the big White House advisor, get away with it.
[00:44:17.762 --> 00:44:20.424]  I give you Max Keiser until the bottom of the next hour.
[00:44:20.424 --> 00:44:23.026]  Graciously joining us at MaxKeiser.com.
[00:44:23.026 --> 00:44:25.508]  American broadcaster, filmmaker, former equities broker.
[00:44:25.508 --> 00:44:29.612]  Keiser is the host of On The Edge, BBC, Press TV, RT.
[00:44:29.612 --> 00:44:33.836]  They invented the virtual trading system used by many stock markets around the world today.
[00:44:33.836 --> 00:44:35.097]  MaxKeiser.com.
[00:44:35.097 --> 00:44:37.359]  Max, this is a big deal, is it not?
[00:44:37.359 --> 00:44:42.023]  Do you agree this is a big giant rat in front of everyone, leaving the sinking ship?
[00:44:43.388 --> 00:44:44.091]  Alex, time to go.
[00:44:44.091 --> 00:44:45.216]  Thanks for having me on.
[00:44:45.216 --> 00:44:45.838]  Good to have you.
[00:44:45.838 --> 00:44:46.882]  Can you hear me okay?
[00:44:46.882 --> 00:44:47.163]  Yes, sir.
[00:44:48.646 --> 00:44:49.286]  All right, great.
[00:44:49.286 --> 00:45:15.002]  Well, this is what I'm hearing, basically, over at MF Global, is that Corzine, of course, being somebody who doesn't really know how to run a brokerage business, he was speculating in his firm, MF Global, and he rang up about a billion, a billion and a half dollars in losses
[00:45:16.489 --> 00:45:30.299]  And it was going to come to the point where he'd have to call up his creditors, which in this case is JP Morgan, and tell them that he was going to go bankrupt, that he wouldn't make good on that collateral.
[00:45:30.299 --> 00:45:38.605]  At which point Jamie Dimon told John Corzine, either take that money out of your customer accounts, or we'll kill you.
[00:45:39.446 --> 00:45:45.871]  So he threatened to kill Corzine if he didn't take the money out of the customer accounts and Corzine did exactly that.
[00:45:45.871 --> 00:45:50.115]  He took the money out of the customer accounts and now the customers don't get their money.
[00:45:50.115 --> 00:45:54.339]  By the way, Max, you don't you don't make stuff up from the time that I've talked to you.
[00:45:54.339 --> 00:45:57.902]  Sometimes you joke around and stuff, but when you're serious, you don't really toot your horn a lot.
[00:45:57.902 --> 00:46:01.465]  I mean, you know, George Soros, you know, his son, you know, I mean,
[00:46:02.185 --> 00:46:02.585]  I don't know.
[00:46:18.638 --> 00:46:22.259]  That are saying that they told him, we're going to kill you.
[00:46:22.259 --> 00:46:23.399]  And that is how they operate.
[00:46:23.399 --> 00:46:25.300]  I mean, they run the wars.
[00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:27.341]  JPMorgan is the boss.
[00:46:27.341 --> 00:46:31.002]  And then, of course, below that is their mafia Don Goldman Sachs.
[00:46:31.002 --> 00:46:38.144]  And you're saying JPMorgan told him, Jamie Dimon told him, you do this or you're going to sleep with the fishes.
[00:46:39.423 --> 00:46:44.328]  Right, ask John Perkins, Confessions of an Economic Hitman.
[00:46:44.328 --> 00:46:49.052]  This is the way American banks do business around the world, now they're doing it in America.
[00:46:49.052 --> 00:46:52.936]  Just like America flies drones around the world, now they're doing it in America.
[00:46:54.537 --> 00:46:56.519]  And tortures and kills people around the world.
[00:46:56.519 --> 00:46:57.560]  Now they do it in America.
[00:46:57.560 --> 00:46:58.721]  So it's just like Madoff.
[00:46:58.721 --> 00:47:00.022]  It's just like Madoff.
[00:47:00.022 --> 00:47:12.214]  I mean, now it's been admitted, and federal courts are even having to admit it, that, wait a minute, he moved a bunch of money to people and warned people, and he was really just a front man, as you said a year and a half ago, for bigger interests.
[00:47:12.214 --> 00:47:17.840]  And the same thing you said years ago was, you know, they're basically told, you take the fall or you're dead.
[00:47:19.212 --> 00:47:21.393]  Right, well, I mean, you mentioned Madoff.
[00:47:21.393 --> 00:47:23.833]  Let's talk about Madoff for a second.
[00:47:23.833 --> 00:47:44.618]  It's interesting that Madoff, Lehman Brothers, AIG, and MF Global, all of them run through the City of London, because only in the City of London is it possible to re-hypothecate, that is to say, re-loan securities out, putting up no collateral whatsoever.
[00:47:44.878 --> 00:47:48.581]  They have a situation there which is infinite hypothecation.
[00:47:48.581 --> 00:47:55.186]  In America, you can only lend out 140% of customer accounts for loans.
[00:47:55.186 --> 00:47:58.188]  So there's no fractional reserve banking in the City of London.
[00:47:58.188 --> 00:47:58.969]  It's to infinity.
[00:47:59.821 --> 00:48:03.143]  That's absolutely correct in this context.
[00:48:03.143 --> 00:48:09.868]  And that's why AIG, Lehman Brothers, Madoff, and MF Global all go through the City of London.
[00:48:09.868 --> 00:48:22.457]  Which is why when David Cameron recently had his kerfuffle in Brussels where he said, I'm going to safeguard the City of London and I'm not going to be part of your treaty revision.
[00:48:22.457 --> 00:48:27.121]  Well, what he's saying is that his masters, the people in the City of London,
[00:48:27.501 --> 00:48:42.871]  Who are a part of this, the epicenter of the global financial terrorism network, are telling David Cameron that in no circumstances will they ever allow anyone to regulate them in any way.
[00:48:42.871 --> 00:48:48.795]  So Cameron dutifully ran back to London with his tail between his legs doing the bidding of the
[00:48:49.275 --> 00:49:00.747]  Financial terrorists in the City of London, which gave us, again let me repeat, they gave us MF Global, AIG, Lehman and Madoff, and they are the epicenter of this meltdown that's happening now.
[00:49:00.747 --> 00:49:05.511]  What's happening in Europe, as everyone can see, is the banks are melting down.
[00:49:05.511 --> 00:49:06.753]  No matter how much money
[00:49:07.733 --> 00:49:22.826]  Let's say the European Central Bank makes available to try to smooth out the problems in these European banks, the hedge funds and the private equity managers can create 10 times that amount of credit default swaps used to
[00:49:23.346 --> 00:49:32.008]  Crack that bond market to get those yields high to crush these countries because they want to buy all the assets for pennies on the dollar.
[00:49:32.008 --> 00:49:32.909]  We're seeing it in Greece.
[00:49:32.909 --> 00:49:34.849]  They're buying the assets for pennies on the dollar.
[00:49:34.849 --> 00:49:36.129]  We're seeing it in Ireland.
[00:49:36.129 --> 00:49:38.330]  They're giving away assets for pennies on the dollar.
[00:49:38.330 --> 00:49:39.930]  They want to do the same thing in Italy.
[00:49:39.930 --> 00:49:42.251]  They want to do the same thing in Spain and France.
[00:49:42.251 --> 00:49:45.292]  And they use these credit default swaps again.
[00:49:46.152 --> 00:50:08.082]  The point of always raising taxes and regulations till all the small farms and businesses go bankrupt is so that then you get to own those and now they're sharecroppers, they're now renters, and what they previously owned, and that's what's so scary Max, for at least 15 years, quietly behind the scenes, the entire architecture is to wage war on rural communities in the U.S.
[00:50:08.082 --> 00:50:09.023]  and now they're admitting it.
[00:50:11.305 --> 00:50:21.097]  These interest rates on these European bonds, they keep going 6, 7%, 8%, which we hear is the unsustainable levels that are guaranteed for a deflationary implosion.
[00:50:21.097 --> 00:50:22.498]  Well, why do they keep going higher?
[00:50:22.498 --> 00:50:25.341]  It's because no matter what anyone does, and the governments,
[00:50:25.922 --> 00:50:38.407]  The private equity and hedge fund managers, which are bigger than any governments, use naked swaps and credit default swaps to crush the bond market to get those yields high to bankrupt these corporations.
[00:50:38.407 --> 00:50:45.909]  And they're able to do it through the loophole that is the City of London, which allows you to borrow an infinite amount of money with no collateral.
[00:50:45.909 --> 00:50:46.770]  Now, Max, stay there.
[00:50:46.770 --> 00:50:47.150]  Stay there.
[00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:50.571]  I understand you're giving us how the scam works, but I want to get into specifically
[00:50:50.891 --> 00:50:52.753]  And the video clip's coming up in the audio.
[00:50:52.753 --> 00:51:01.044]  The magnitude of the head of the CME Group, the big commodities umbrella, not lying for Corzine and saying Corzine's lying in correctional testimony.
[00:51:01.044 --> 00:51:05.770]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:53:05.299 --> 00:53:07.799]  Where does Islam fit in Bible prophecy?
[00:53:07.799 --> 00:53:10.960]  Is the New World Order world government?
[00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:19.062]  These and other crucial end time questions are answered in the new DVD package, Understanding the End Time, from End Time Ministries.
[00:53:19.062 --> 00:53:27.044]  Jesus Christ said, I tell you these things before they come to pass, so that when they do come to pass, you might believe.

[00:54:02.017 --> 00:54:07.839]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:07.839 --> 00:54:09.719]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:54:09.719 --> 00:54:23.543]  Alright, Max Keiser will be with us at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:54:27.233 --> 00:54:36.222]  Going back to him here in just a moment, and he's getting into the technicals of how this inner group of six big banks and brokerage firms can just create unlimited capital.
[00:54:36.222 --> 00:54:37.464]  And that's how they get away with all this.
[00:54:37.464 --> 00:54:43.209]  And now it came out in Reuters, Bloomberg, you name it, that JPMorgan got the money.
[00:54:43.209 --> 00:54:45.191]  And then they just said, well, never mind that.
[00:54:45.191 --> 00:54:48.435]  We're not even going to say that didn't happen, but we're just going to say we don't know where it went.
[00:54:50.077 --> 00:54:51.878]  And then they kept saying, you'll get your money back.
[00:54:51.878 --> 00:54:53.459]  Now they say you're not going to get it back.
[00:54:53.459 --> 00:54:56.241]  And then Corzine gets up there and says, I don't know where it went.
[00:54:56.241 --> 00:54:57.302]  Think about that.
[00:54:57.302 --> 00:55:04.626]  And now the head of the CME group has come out and said, I was in the meetings and he, uh, I was told that he's the one that gave the orders.
[00:55:04.626 --> 00:55:06.327]  Of course he gave the orders as the CEO.
[00:55:07.606 --> 00:55:08.126]  Of course!
[00:55:08.126 --> 00:55:09.727]  I mean, this is crazy!
[00:55:09.727 --> 00:55:19.674]  He's the former head of Goldman Sachs, but notice it's JP Morgan telling the Goldman Sachs people, and I want to nail Max down on specifically the thing of, you're dead if you don't do this.
[00:55:19.674 --> 00:55:28.539]  Now, before we go any further, if you want to support us and the Infowar operation to get tools to wake people up, you get your order in by Sunday night, maybe even Monday morning.

[00:55:46.094 --> 00:55:47.876]  Professionally, you know, written up on the back.
[00:55:47.876 --> 00:55:48.616]  Professionally made.
[00:55:48.616 --> 00:55:49.497]  It'll wake them up.
[00:55:49.497 --> 00:55:51.179]  And say, hey, it's an action-adventure film.
[00:55:51.179 --> 00:55:52.600]  Watch it.
[00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:54.902]  But it's an action-adventure film that's reality-based.
[00:55:54.902 --> 00:55:56.704]  It's non-fiction, action-adventure.
[00:55:56.704 --> 00:55:57.145]  You'll like it.
[00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:00.422]  Reality is pretty exciting.
[00:56:00.422 --> 00:56:03.584]  So give the gift of truth, as I've said for 16 years.
[00:56:03.584 --> 00:56:05.245]  Now Glenn Beck is saying that.
[00:56:05.245 --> 00:56:07.087]  I gotta start trademarking this stuff.
[00:56:07.087 --> 00:56:10.089]  Give the gift of truth today, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:11.607 --> 00:56:17.472]  At Infowars.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:56:17.472 --> 00:56:18.412]  888-253-3139.
[00:56:18.412 --> 00:56:25.458]  And you can also get 44% off on a yearly membership right now at PrisonPlanet.tv with the nightly news and everything else.
[00:56:25.458 --> 00:56:29.381]  Okay, Max, again, I'm going to pretty much have you unbridled in the next thing.
[00:56:29.381 --> 00:56:30.882]  I'm just so wound up today.
[00:56:30.882 --> 00:56:32.524]  Briefly, as we go to break in about three minutes.
[00:56:33.894 --> 00:56:34.694]  Yeah.
[00:56:34.694 --> 00:56:46.020]  Are you saying your sources told you that the head of Goldman, that the head of JP Morgan told the former head of Goldman Sachs, the head of MF Global Corzine, you give us our money, pal, or you're gonna sleep with the fishes?
[00:56:47.676 --> 00:57:00.698]  Yeah, I mean, look, the timing of it during the testimony is the CME head, as you pointed out, was talking about the fact that they were quite aware of this for three weeks.
[00:57:00.698 --> 00:57:03.999]  And the point kept being made that this is not an accounting error.
[00:57:03.999 --> 00:57:05.679]  We've searched all the accounts.
[00:57:05.679 --> 00:57:10.880]  It was a blatant disregard of the law where they came in and they took customer money.
[00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:16.361]  And they did this because Diamond put a gun to his head and said, either you do this and make us whole or we're going to blow your
[00:57:16.801 --> 00:57:19.543]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[00:57:19.543 --> 00:57:20.704]  Max, we can't talk like that.
[00:57:20.704 --> 00:57:24.808]  This is actual broadcast radio, so we had to bleep that out, okay?
[00:57:24.808 --> 00:57:25.989]  All right?
[00:57:25.989 --> 00:57:28.010]  But you're saying sources told you this?
[00:57:28.010 --> 00:57:29.671]  How can Jamie Dimon do that?
[00:57:29.671 --> 00:57:41.561]  Because back in the year 2000, during the passage of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act, it made all derivatives trading what no longer was considered gambling.
[00:57:41.721 --> 00:57:50.706]  Up until then, they were considered gambling, but under that new legislation, they were no longer gambling, and it gave precedence to all derivative contracts above all securities, all cash, all banks.
[00:57:50.706 --> 00:57:55.669]  Whoever's wielding derivatives has the law on their side.
[00:57:55.669 --> 00:57:58.290]  So, Diamond says, we are the derivatives wielder.
[00:57:58.290 --> 00:57:59.671]  Therefore, we are the law.
[00:58:00.131 --> 00:58:03.474]  You, you, you can just give us our money or we're gonna kill you!
[00:58:03.474 --> 00:58:03.854]  Okay?
[00:58:03.854 --> 00:58:07.037]  Why is it different than the 1930s and the gangland and the gang wars?
[00:58:07.037 --> 00:58:08.198]  It's no different!
[00:58:08.198 --> 00:58:11.080]  These banks are now just out-of-control gangsters!
[00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:13.141]  And they're putting contracts on each other!
[00:58:13.141 --> 00:58:15.964]  Look at the whistleblower, Andrew McGuire, in London.
[00:58:15.964 --> 00:58:17.065]  He told that H.A.P.
[00:58:17.065 --> 00:58:18.806]  Morgan was manipulating the silver market.
[00:58:18.806 --> 00:58:20.808]  He walked out of that hearing and got hit by a car!
[00:58:20.808 --> 00:58:28.274]  Well, look at how they killed, uh, look at how they killed, look at how they killed Madoff's son a week after that newspaper interview got published.
[00:58:28.954 --> 00:58:29.695]  You saw that?
[00:58:29.695 --> 00:58:30.676]  I mean, they hung him.
[00:58:30.676 --> 00:58:32.538]  I know, it's incredible.
[00:58:32.538 --> 00:58:32.958]  Stay there.
[00:58:32.958 --> 00:58:36.602]  Back in 60 seconds with the second hour with Max Keiser.
[00:58:36.602 --> 00:58:43.248]  We're going to play this congressional testimony.
[00:58:43.248 --> 00:58:47.212]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:51.755 --> 00:58:53.457]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:53.457 --> 00:58:58.784]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:58:58.784 --> 00:59:00.307]  Saving means to make money.
[00:59:00.307 --> 00:59:09.098]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:59:09.819 --> 00:59:17.362]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:59:17.362 --> 00:59:25.365]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:59:25.365 --> 00:59:30.587]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[01:00:05.356 --> 01:00:10.180]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:11.781]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.781 --> 01:00:13.323]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.323 --> 01:00:17.506]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.506 --> 01:00:21.570]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.625 --> 01:00:25.946]  All right, it's hour number two.
[01:00:25.946 --> 01:00:27.288]  Max Keiser is our guest.
[01:00:27.288 --> 01:00:33.614]  We're going to take some calls specifically for Max on the economy, on MF Global, and the huge aftershocks of that.
[01:00:33.614 --> 01:00:40.140]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:43.543]  But we'll continue with him for a while before we get to those calls.
[01:00:43.543 --> 01:00:46.386]  And up at the next segment, I want to play a clip of what he's talking about.
[01:00:47.026 --> 01:00:55.079]  Specifically then, you've been told by sources, I want to nail this down, that the word was given, you better do this.
[01:00:57.185 --> 01:00:58.806]  Yes, Alex.
[01:00:58.806 --> 01:01:01.809]  But why should we be surprised?
[01:01:01.809 --> 01:01:03.450]  This is no big thing.
[01:01:03.450 --> 01:01:04.832]  This is the world we live in.
[01:01:04.832 --> 01:01:06.913]  Bankers are now terrorists.
[01:01:06.913 --> 01:01:08.435]  They're financial terrorists.
[01:01:08.435 --> 01:01:11.477]  They threaten to kill you unless you give them money.
[01:01:11.477 --> 01:01:14.040]  And they'll take it right out of your individual account.
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:17.563]  The brokerage account statement you get every month is worthless.
[01:01:17.563 --> 01:01:19.825]  The bank account statement you get every month is just
[01:01:20.445 --> 01:01:22.228]  Symbols on a piece of paper.
[01:01:22.228 --> 01:01:23.830]  Doesn't mean you own any of that stuff.
[01:01:23.830 --> 01:01:29.057]  The way the law works now, the second you put cash in a bank, the bank owns that cash.
[01:01:29.057 --> 01:01:31.721]  And they can take it for whatever reason they want to.
[01:01:31.721 --> 01:01:35.286]  Anyone who has money in a bank or a brokerage firm, it's not your money anymore.
[01:01:35.546 --> 01:01:39.011]  And I hope you don't ever want to believe that you'll ever have use of that money.
[01:01:39.011 --> 01:01:41.315]  This is what we're learning from the MF Global scandal.
[01:01:41.315 --> 01:01:44.740]  And let me point something very, very important here.
[01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:50.429]  The HSBC, the bank in London, has now got a lawsuit against MF Global.
[01:01:50.689 --> 01:01:57.637]  As it relates to the GLD, which is the gold that trades on the New York Stock Exchange.
[01:01:57.637 --> 01:01:59.419]  They have something like 3,000 tons.
[01:01:59.419 --> 01:02:01.361]  It's a huge percentage of gold.
[01:02:01.361 --> 01:02:10.591]  As it becomes clear now that anyone who owns GLD does not own anything but a piece of worthless piece of paper, people are now liquidating GLD and
[01:02:10.851 --> 01:02:15.354]  SLV, which is JP Morgan's custodian silver vehicle.
[01:02:15.354 --> 01:02:17.836]  That's why gold and silver are down today.
[01:02:17.836 --> 01:02:19.878]  It's a direct result of MF Global.
[01:02:19.878 --> 01:02:20.999]  Here's something else.
[01:02:20.999 --> 01:02:33.728]  The money stolen from MF Global in the commodity accounts relating to silver, if you do the accounting, is the exact same to the gram amount that JP Morgan just reported in their books that they increased the amount of silver.
[01:02:33.728 --> 01:02:36.410]  They are short silver, as reported on your show many times.
[01:02:36.410 --> 01:02:38.992]  They need silver desperately or they'll go out of business.
[01:02:39.392 --> 01:02:42.174]  That COMEX, again, risk of going out of business.
[01:02:42.174 --> 01:02:44.036]  They needed that money, that silver.
[01:02:44.036 --> 01:02:46.218]  They took it directly out of customer accounts.
[01:02:46.218 --> 01:02:49.881]  Those customers that don't have the silver in their accounts, it's now in JP Morgan's books.
[01:02:49.881 --> 01:02:50.801]  They stole it!
[01:02:50.801 --> 01:03:02.391]  Because they don't want to have to suffer any consequences from being a licentious, litigiously, larcenistic, assassination crew of gangsters who want all your frickin' money!
[01:03:02.391 --> 01:03:03.872]  So, this is what we're dealing with.
[01:03:05.564 --> 01:03:07.709]  And it is a type of insanity.
[01:03:07.709 --> 01:03:15.785]  I mean, they run the world, they run the major militaries, they have nuclear weapons, and they say it all the time, we have nuclear weapons, we can do whatever we want, and they're crazy.
[01:03:16.505 --> 01:03:20.728]  And they're hiring cops and enforcers and bureaucrats that are crazy.
[01:03:20.728 --> 01:03:25.711]  And I run into bureaucrats and cops and people, not all of them, but a lot of them, and they're like crazy now.
[01:03:25.711 --> 01:03:27.573]  They're just so confident.
[01:03:27.573 --> 01:03:31.195]  And of course, we know pride goes before a fall.
[01:03:31.195 --> 01:03:32.356]  And they're like Caligula.
[01:03:32.356 --> 01:03:33.817]  They're delusional.
[01:03:33.817 --> 01:03:35.478]  I think they're going to start World War III, Max.
[01:03:35.478 --> 01:03:36.739]  I think they're going to destroy all of us.
[01:03:36.739 --> 01:03:37.680]  I mean, these people are nuts.
[01:03:39.022 --> 01:03:40.183]  Well, they're just greedy.
[01:03:40.183 --> 01:03:41.204]  That's all there is to it.
[01:03:41.204 --> 01:03:46.608]  I mean, Diamond and Lloyd Blankfein and Wall Street and the City of London, they're just greedy.
[01:03:46.608 --> 01:03:50.111]  I think what happened going back to 9-11, it scared the heck out of them.
[01:03:50.111 --> 01:04:04.863]  And from 9-11 going forward, their mission has been to take as much as they possibly can because they fear that the barbarians are at the gate and they've just used an opportunity, they've changed the laws, to steal all the physical assets.
[01:04:05.083 --> 01:04:07.685]  All the gold and all the silver and all the real assets.
[01:04:07.685 --> 01:04:10.068]  They swapped it with tons of debt.
[01:04:10.068 --> 01:04:12.190]  That debt, of course, can't be paid.
[01:04:12.190 --> 01:04:14.011]  And the people are revolting all over the world.
[01:04:14.011 --> 01:04:16.934]  Time Magazine had the protester as the person of the year.
[01:04:16.934 --> 01:04:19.276]  That's the global insurrection against banker occupation.
[01:04:19.276 --> 01:04:22.299]  That's the direct result of bankers changing laws to make money.
[01:04:22.299 --> 01:04:23.660]  But here's the deal.
[01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:28.625]  JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, they already ran the world.
[01:04:29.145 --> 01:04:36.927]  So why just toxify everything so they can grab all the little crumbs and then turn everyone against them?
[01:04:36.927 --> 01:04:37.587]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:04:37.587 --> 01:04:38.647]  They're megalomaniacs.
[01:04:38.647 --> 01:04:45.749]  There's no way... Look, I don't know how many rich people you know, Alex, but the rich people tend to want to be richer.
[01:04:45.749 --> 01:04:51.411]  You know, the greatest wealth disparity is not between the 1% and the bottom 99%.
[01:04:52.691 --> 01:04:55.632]  It's between the top one-tenth of one percent.
[01:04:55.632 --> 01:04:56.272]  Yeah, that's key.
[01:04:56.272 --> 01:05:00.892]  Let's explain the ultra-rich versus the one percent when we get back.
[01:05:00.892 --> 01:05:02.433]  Attention GCN listeners.

[01:06:01.611 --> 01:06:16.058]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.

[01:07:00.544 --> 01:07:02.146]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:07:02.146 --> 01:07:08.453]  This holiday season, more than half of our nation is in need of help due to the shattered economy.
[01:07:08.453 --> 01:07:12.477]  So now is the time to express the holiday spirit more than ever.
[01:07:12.477 --> 01:07:17.303]  Consider helping those you love with the most important gift, a supply of delicious,

[01:07:46.556 --> 01:07:47.737]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:07:47.737 --> 01:07:49.098]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:14.491 --> 01:08:18.117]  Gunter Spens was a member of the
[01:08:19.972 --> 01:08:32.895]  Each German army, he was a colonel, and he was at the main base, Leipzig, where they refused to fire on the German citizens that caused the fall of the Berlin Wall.
[01:08:32.895 --> 01:08:37.956]  He's a part of Oath Keepers, and it's on record that all this happened.
[01:08:37.956 --> 01:08:41.197]  Amazing, because before that, they would shoot the people trying to cross.
[01:08:41.197 --> 01:08:48.319]  There's a famous photo from the 60s that my mother brought me back from Germany, and I put it in storage, and now I can't find it.
[01:08:49.121 --> 01:09:09.075]  It was a big poster, blow-up of the photo, and it's of the barbed wire there in East Berlin, and it's a woman, and she's gone through, and the toddler has gotten caught in the barbed wire, and he lifts up the barbed wire, gets the child, and hands it over, and there's several photos, but I have one of them.
[01:09:09.075 --> 01:09:11.397]  You can find them online, I forget the name of it.
[01:09:11.397 --> 01:09:16.941]  And boy, that soldier that helped that baby get to its parents, never seen again.
[01:09:18.157 --> 01:09:20.980]  And this is the decision coming here in America.
[01:09:20.980 --> 01:09:28.667]  You're always going to be given a good cover story, a good reason to hate the American people and go along with this for totally ruthless banks.
[01:09:28.667 --> 01:09:34.232]  I mean, Corzine is the main financial advisor to Obama.
[01:09:34.232 --> 01:09:36.234]  Corzine is one of their main architects.
[01:09:36.234 --> 01:09:39.176]  Corzine's a former New Jersey governor, former head of Goldman Sachs.
[01:09:39.176 --> 01:09:41.318]  He sets up MF Global.
[01:09:41.318 --> 01:09:42.419]  He goes out and makes 40 to 1 bets.
[01:09:45.472 --> 01:09:48.014]  The media said 38 to 1 bet.
[01:09:48.014 --> 01:09:49.295]  Kaiser's saying 40 to 1 bet.
[01:09:49.295 --> 01:09:58.301]  The point is, it's JP Morgan money, and then it was reported the money went there, and then the media is so controlled they won't talk about it.
[01:09:58.301 --> 01:10:00.262]  Now, Max Kaiser's our guest.
[01:10:00.262 --> 01:10:04.745]  Before we went to break, he was raising the point of, Occupy Wall Street's talking about the 1%.
[01:10:04.745 --> 01:10:08.467]  It's one-tenth of 1% that actually controls everything.
[01:10:08.467 --> 01:10:11.870]  And they're the ultra-rich waging war against the free market.
[01:10:11.870 --> 01:10:13.571]  They are monopoly capitalists.
[01:10:14.031 --> 01:10:16.193]  Crony capitalists, in their own words!
[01:10:16.193 --> 01:10:19.676]  The founder of the Rockefeller dynasty said, competition is a sin.
[01:10:19.676 --> 01:10:24.860]  So Max, briefly speak to that, but I need to get to the main reason you're here.
[01:10:24.860 --> 01:10:29.924]  CME chief alleges Corzine aware of transfers, and we have the testimony here.
[01:10:29.924 --> 01:10:32.607]  He had the prepared testimony on the CME Group website.
[01:10:34.065 --> 01:10:41.028]  As he's done in other testimony, suddenly he broke with it and said, I was told in the meetings that Corzine knew and gave the orders to take the money.
[01:10:41.028 --> 01:10:45.550]  Now again, he's saying, I'm not going to go down with the ship for you.
[01:10:45.550 --> 01:10:49.992]  And that gives us faith, folks, because if Corzine can go to jail, like Madoff,
[01:10:50.834 --> 01:10:52.635]  Then Jamie Dimon can go to jail.
[01:10:52.635 --> 01:10:54.216]  Because folks, they all need to be in jail.
[01:10:54.216 --> 01:10:55.336]  It could all end.
[01:10:55.336 --> 01:10:57.477]  You know, the infrastructure of tyranny is there now.
[01:10:57.477 --> 01:10:59.918]  So the problem is, if you get rid of these guys, more will get in there.
[01:10:59.918 --> 01:11:05.020]  But if you send enough of them to prison, and then expose it like a bad nightmare, it can end.
[01:11:05.020 --> 01:11:08.222]  Because then the documents will come out, whistleblowers won't be as scared.
[01:11:08.222 --> 01:11:11.423]  There's huge persecution of whistleblowers going on right now on record.
[01:11:11.423 --> 01:11:13.104]  Media people being persecuted.
[01:11:13.104 --> 01:11:14.145]  It can stop.
[01:11:14.145 --> 01:11:18.386]  But they think they're going to bring in a North Com tyranny and get away with it all.
[01:11:18.386 --> 01:11:19.327]  Like they're doing in Europe!
[01:11:20.339 --> 01:11:24.942]  I mean, they're announcing banks took over through fraud, Goldman Sachs rules Europe.
[01:11:24.942 --> 01:11:26.043]  That's headlines.
[01:11:26.043 --> 01:11:28.024]  They're celebrating.
[01:11:28.024 --> 01:11:34.348]  But really, they're little scared crooks like Corzine, who looks scared in those testimonies, because he's up there bald-faced lying, folks.
[01:11:34.348 --> 01:11:36.009]  Of course he knows where the money went.
[01:11:36.009 --> 01:11:38.091]  The government knows where the transfers went.
[01:11:38.091 --> 01:11:41.073]  This claim, Max Keiser, speak to that, and then the...
[01:11:42.617 --> 01:11:44.459]  One-tenth of one percent instead of the one percent.
[01:11:44.459 --> 01:11:46.281]  And then I want to get into the big enchilada.
[01:11:46.281 --> 01:11:50.044]  Why do you think he is jumping ship and not playing patty cake?
[01:11:50.044 --> 01:11:52.507]  And will his kids start being found dead?
[01:11:52.507 --> 01:11:53.648]  Or will he die in a car wreck?
[01:11:54.858 --> 01:11:58.181]  Well, he's being, essentially, he's a whistleblower.
[01:11:58.181 --> 01:12:01.383]  And we know that whistleblowers are targeted.
[01:12:01.383 --> 01:12:08.989]  Again, you know, the Andrew McGuire case from just a few months ago, testifying about JP Morgan's manipulation of the silver market in London.
[01:12:08.989 --> 01:12:10.531]  And he was hit by a car.
[01:12:10.531 --> 01:12:11.852]  So, this type of thing.
[01:12:11.852 --> 01:12:13.693]  So, he's acting as a whistleblower.
[01:12:13.693 --> 01:12:15.134]  And he said it came out of nowhere.
[01:12:15.134 --> 01:12:15.835]  It was after him.
[01:12:17.403 --> 01:12:21.308]  Well, he had a crisis of conscience and suddenly spilled the beans.
[01:12:21.308 --> 01:12:22.470]  So this happens sometimes.
[01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:26.335]  Human beings occasionally act, have a crisis of conscience.
[01:12:26.335 --> 01:12:30.020]  Occasionally a human being will respond to a moral good.
[01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:31.102]  Occasionally that happens.
[01:12:31.102 --> 01:12:32.183]  And this is what happened.
[01:12:32.183 --> 01:12:33.926]  Suddenly he became human.
[01:12:34.446 --> 01:12:40.467]  And this is something that the MF Global or JP Morgan hadn't counted on, that somebody would act like a human being.
[01:12:40.467 --> 01:12:41.848]  That was a human being risk.
[01:12:41.848 --> 01:12:43.848]  They weren't hedged against humanity.
[01:12:43.848 --> 01:12:46.069]  They're not hedged against people acting like humans.
[01:12:46.069 --> 01:12:54.091]  They only have robots down on the floor of the exchange who do their bidding by conducting algorithmic trading that is all programmed to steal money every single day.
[01:12:54.091 --> 01:12:58.292]  But getting to this 1% issue, you know, the 1% versus the 99%.
[01:12:59.392 --> 01:13:04.678]  To make it into the 1% in America, you need a million dollars in cash, okay?
[01:13:04.678 --> 01:13:09.264]  Now the fact is there are millions of people in America with a million dollars in cash.
[01:13:09.264 --> 01:13:10.105]  It's no big thing.
[01:13:10.105 --> 01:13:15.892]  And they're the ones that buy cars and go to your restaurant and buy houses and get rock walls built at their houses.
[01:13:15.892 --> 01:13:17.274]  They're the people that run the economy.
[01:13:18.407 --> 01:13:20.028]  They're just middle management types.
[01:13:20.028 --> 01:13:31.492]  Now, to get to, let's say, $10 billion, which is a nice chunk of money, you're making $27 million every single day for 365 days.
[01:13:31.492 --> 01:13:33.212]  And that's what somebody in the top one-tenth of 1% makes.
[01:13:33.212 --> 01:13:34.413]  They make $27 million every single day.
[01:13:37.614 --> 01:13:41.198]  A hedge fund manager pays themselves 5, 10 billion dollars.
[01:13:41.198 --> 01:13:50.129]  And I've noticed in their divorce cases and stuff it comes out that they're obsessed with beating each other and it's all like a race car race as they destroy the world.
[01:13:50.129 --> 01:13:52.552]  I guess that plays to that suicide banker point you make.
[01:13:53.390 --> 01:14:07.039]  Well, this is, you know, if you go to the Belhaven Club in Greenwich, Connecticut, and you sit around with a bunch of billionaire hedge fund managers, you know, they're all basically just competing with each other, and they're willing to throw the country under the bus to do it.
[01:14:07.039 --> 01:14:09.180]  They think it's oh so amusing.
[01:14:09.180 --> 01:14:16.485]  And having, you know, been with these folks, myself, working on Wall Street as a stockbroker for many years, that's the mentality.
[01:14:16.485 --> 01:14:18.566]  So when you say, why do they think they need to make
[01:14:18.826 --> 01:14:24.930]  Go from $100 million to $200 million or from $1 billion to $5 billion because that's who they're competing with.
[01:14:24.930 --> 01:14:28.392]  And they're willing to break any law, write new laws, or kill somebody.
[01:14:28.392 --> 01:14:31.113]  It's no big deal to kill somebody.
[01:14:31.113 --> 01:14:32.534]  That's just par for the course.
[01:14:32.534 --> 01:14:33.835]  And here's the other big issue.
[01:14:34.355 --> 01:15:01.963]  They've got the government on the payroll, and so now as crimes are committed, everybody in the system's engaged in some kind of crime, so they can't blow the whistle on an even bigger crime, because then that will bring them down, and so there's a natural progression where the crimes get wilder and wilder and crazier and crazier, like DuPont running around raping people and driving tanks with machine guns in the local town screaming, I'm God.
[01:15:01.963 --> 01:15:03.804]  I mean, and the cops are like, that's just what he does.
[01:15:04.977 --> 01:15:15.209]  Well, you say the government's on the payroll, and the payroll is stretching it a little bit, because, I mean, for $200,000, you can get Congress to write a new law for a bank on Wall Street.
[01:15:15.209 --> 01:15:16.210]  That's hardly pay.
[01:15:16.210 --> 01:15:18.072]  I mean, that's a stipend.
[01:15:18.072 --> 01:15:19.694]  It's not even chicken feed.
[01:15:19.694 --> 01:15:20.295]  That's the thing.
[01:15:20.295 --> 01:15:23.879]  They sell out for not even one one-millionth.
[01:15:24.710 --> 01:15:33.574]  Yeah, I'd love to see Congress hold out and try to, at least for half of, you know, three or four million dollars before they break the law for a bank.
[01:15:33.574 --> 01:15:37.096]  I mean, maybe that would help solve the deficit in America, but they'll do it for $200,000.
[01:15:37.096 --> 01:15:41.198]  I mean, I, almost anybody can buy a congressman.
[01:15:41.198 --> 01:15:41.878]  They're so cheap.
[01:15:41.878 --> 01:15:43.379]  They're like $2 whores.
[01:15:43.379 --> 01:15:46.180]  Almost anyone can get a congressman to change a law for you.
[01:15:46.180 --> 01:15:50.022]  And if it takes $100,000 or $200,000 and if you're a bank on Wall Street, it's really,
[01:15:50.342 --> 01:16:00.471]  You're right, they are the equivalent of disheveled crack whores with cigarette burns all over them that are less than a quarter.
[01:16:00.471 --> 01:16:04.134]  I mean, I've seen poor crack whores that look like Dawn of the Dead zombies.
[01:16:05.128 --> 01:16:08.973]  The bonuses on Wall Street last year were $140 billion.
[01:16:08.973 --> 01:16:19.726]  So when you read about folks like, oh, there's a party of five or six brokers in Paris celebrating a bonus, and by the way, the check for the meal, for dinner, was $130,000.
[01:16:19.726 --> 01:16:20.767]  I mean, that's nothing to them.
[01:16:23.911 --> 01:16:25.672]  That's absolutely nothing!
[01:16:25.672 --> 01:16:29.115]  That's no money to them, because they're getting paid billions!
[01:16:29.115 --> 01:16:30.336]  So where does that money come from?
[01:16:30.336 --> 01:16:35.099]  It comes from society that has to underwrite and subsidize these people through austerity!
[01:16:35.099 --> 01:16:42.844]  And that's why you have a global insurrection against banker occupation, because the globe doesn't want to subsidize, pay the welfare to Jamie Dimon anymore.
[01:16:42.844 --> 01:16:45.686]  They don't want to pay Lloyd Blankfein's welfare anymore.
[01:16:45.686 --> 01:16:47.908]  They want to just work and make money for themselves.
[01:16:47.908 --> 01:16:53.352]  They don't want to tide their money to the Lord Blankfein, like it's some kind of medieval
[01:16:54.072 --> 01:16:59.477]  No, they want to work and live like a real person.
[01:16:59.477 --> 01:17:05.443]  Now again, here is Terry Duffy, who was saying none of this was true just two weeks ago.
[01:17:05.443 --> 01:17:12.389]  Now he changed his testimony and prepared on-the-record text that said one thing, and then he changed three lines.
[01:17:12.389 --> 01:17:19.376]  And it says, after receiving this information, this is the change part, CME remained at MF Global, while MF Global
[01:17:19.796 --> 01:17:28.159]  Attempted to identify funds that could be transferred, so CMT's actually in there catching them, into segregation to reduce or eliminate the discrepancy.
[01:17:28.159 --> 01:17:38.062]  A CME auditor also participated in a phone call with senior MF Global employees wherein, and now those same employees have been caught lying, saying we met but didn't talk about anything.
[01:17:38.062 --> 01:17:41.183]  One employee, at two in the morning, we just met, didn't do anything at the office.
[01:17:41.183 --> 01:17:47.885]  One employee indicated that Mr. Corzine knew about the loans that had been made from the customer segregated accounts.
[01:17:47.885 --> 01:17:48.545]  Of course he knew.
[01:17:49.105 --> 01:17:50.246]  Now they're saying no one knows.
[01:17:50.246 --> 01:17:51.408]  The government knows where the money went.
[01:17:51.408 --> 01:17:52.910]  It was JP Morgan.
[01:17:52.910 --> 01:17:59.037]  CME Group has provided this information, the names of the individuals, to the DOJ.
[01:17:59.037 --> 01:18:00.358]  Good luck!
[01:18:00.358 --> 01:18:04.303]  The DOJ's run by, from our research, the guy that ran the OKC bombing.
[01:18:04.303 --> 01:18:06.225]  These are hardcore killers, folks!
[01:18:06.886 --> 01:18:10.367]  Man, I can't believe I have to challenge killers like this, but I have to do it.
[01:18:10.367 --> 01:18:12.348]  Somebody's got to not be a coward.
[01:18:12.348 --> 01:18:17.950]  Continuing, individuals to the DOG and the CFTC who are investigating these matters.
[01:18:17.950 --> 01:18:18.570]  Boom!
[01:18:18.570 --> 01:18:22.651]  Well, again, Max, we're going to go to break, come back, play the clip, keep you longer because I want to go to calls.
[01:18:22.651 --> 01:18:25.552]  But I mean, this is, it's just, it's right there.
[01:18:25.552 --> 01:18:27.393]  The Justice Department knows.
[01:18:27.393 --> 01:18:31.474]  They're telling the public they don't know where a billion, two hundred million at least went.
[01:18:31.934 --> 01:18:34.935]  The government knows where a $10,000 check goes.
[01:18:34.935 --> 01:18:36.616]  They know where every dime went.
[01:18:36.616 --> 01:18:38.957]  They knew a month ago it was JP Morgan.
[01:18:38.957 --> 01:18:44.180]  But they're God, so no one can talk about them.
[01:18:44.180 --> 01:18:45.401]  Yeah.
[01:18:45.401 --> 01:18:46.121]  Right on, brother.
[01:18:46.121 --> 01:18:49.022]  I mean, how far does it go?
[01:18:49.022 --> 01:18:50.163]  How far will they go, Max?
[01:18:52.128 --> 01:18:54.649]  The question is, how far will we go?
[01:18:54.649 --> 01:18:57.931]  You know, vigilante justice and the global insurrection is on the move.
[01:18:57.931 --> 01:18:59.932]  It's on the cover of Time Magazine.
[01:18:59.932 --> 01:19:03.554]  Now we gotta get some scouts, baby, because we're on the march.
[01:19:03.554 --> 01:19:08.336]  You know, there's no government, there's no law, but it doesn't mean we have to play by their rules.
[01:19:08.336 --> 01:19:09.617]  We know who the criminals are.
[01:19:09.617 --> 01:19:11.198]  We know that they're stealing our money.
[01:19:11.198 --> 01:19:12.879]  Time for vigilante justice!
[01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:19.465]  Now you see Max, the globalist, well then why are Soros and others knee deep in the Occupy?
[01:19:19.465 --> 01:19:22.107]  I'm not saying Occupy is bad, but they're trying to control it.
[01:19:22.107 --> 01:19:28.413]  They want to brand the revolution towards collectivism to suck more of the middle class's money and give it to the offshore banks.
[01:19:28.413 --> 01:19:30.115]  So how do you navigate that morass?
[01:19:31.107 --> 01:19:37.732]  Well, Soros and the Occupy movement is just one facet of this global insurrection against banker occupation.
[01:19:37.732 --> 01:19:38.673]  I agree, I agree.
[01:19:38.673 --> 01:19:41.815]  And the media is using it to brand everything.
[01:19:41.815 --> 01:19:44.617]  Stay there, I've got to play this video clip of what we just read.
[01:19:44.617 --> 01:19:48.320]  We'll come back and we'll keep you even longer if you can take some calls, maybe to 45 after.
[01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:50.161]  MaxKaiser.com is his website.
[01:19:50.161 --> 01:19:53.304]  Our websites are PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com.
[01:19:53.304 --> 01:19:58.448]  We're risking it all to tell you the truth because we know there's no future if we don't beat these psychopathic, crazy people.
[01:20:01.079 --> 01:20:06.065]  After work, I just want to plop down on the couch and watch TV alone.
[01:20:06.065 --> 01:20:06.826]  Come on!
[01:20:06.826 --> 01:20:07.907]  Don't be like that!
[01:20:07.907 --> 01:20:08.528]  Who are you?
[01:20:08.528 --> 01:20:16.717]  I'm you, 20 years ago, when you were full of energy, better shape, great attitude, and you didn't do so bad with the ladies.
[01:20:16.717 --> 01:20:19.240]  Now that you're older, your testosterone levels are dropping and...
[01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:21.921]  Well, you're not the guy you used to be.
[01:20:21.921 --> 01:20:24.323]  I'd give anything to feel like you again.
[01:20:24.323 --> 01:20:26.183]  Just try Ageless Mail!

[01:20:46.034 --> 01:20:47.234]  Where's my phone?
[01:20:47.234 --> 01:20:48.355]  You're laying on it.

[01:21:13.169 --> 01:21:16.771]  A Big Berkey Water Filter gives them protection from bacteria, heavy metals,
[01:21:17.051 --> 01:21:20.794]  Chlorine, fluoride, pesticides and herbicides, VOCs and more.

[01:21:58.530 --> 01:21:59.950]  Give a Big Berkey Water Filter!
[01:22:01.403 --> 01:22:02.845]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.

[01:23:08.526 --> 01:23:17.374]  Modern-day emergencies like floods, tornadoes, earthquakes, snowstorms, terrorist attacks, or anything else can strike anywhere, leaving your family vulnerable.

[01:24:04.416 --> 01:24:09.359]  You know, I watch all the little info babes up on TV, reading off teleprompters, lying to people.
[01:24:09.359 --> 01:24:12.560]  I see the general public starting to wake up.
[01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:16.042]  And Congress has an incredibly low approval rating, 9%.
[01:24:16.042 --> 01:24:17.743]  But that's not enough.
[01:24:17.743 --> 01:24:22.086]  A lot of people out there think they're awake, but then they still laugh at things I talk about.
[01:24:22.086 --> 01:24:23.627]  That's because they have no idea.
[01:24:24.895 --> 01:24:26.236]  How bad things are.
[01:24:26.236 --> 01:24:27.978]  And they haven't studied history.
[01:24:27.978 --> 01:24:31.080]  They've lived in the lap of luxury and freedom.
[01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:35.104]  And like termites, the criminals have been beavering away under us.
[01:24:35.104 --> 01:24:38.566]  And now, people's feet are starting to go to the floor.
[01:24:38.566 --> 01:24:40.888]  You lean on a wall, it falls in.
[01:24:40.888 --> 01:24:43.551]  People are starting to realize, man, there's something going on here.
[01:24:44.775 --> 01:24:50.921]  And the recklessness of these elites is frightening, because it shows megalomania has set in.
[01:24:50.921 --> 01:24:53.523]  I mean, that was some evil, wicked kingpin.
[01:24:53.523 --> 01:24:58.107]  I'd try to have things, you know, conservative-focused, incremental.
[01:24:58.107 --> 01:24:58.867]  They don't do that.
[01:24:58.867 --> 01:25:02.310]  They're just wild now, which shows the megalomania has set in.
[01:25:03.924 --> 01:25:05.765]  What's changed with the head of the CME group?
[01:25:05.765 --> 01:25:08.047]  That's the biggest commodities group out there.
[01:25:08.047 --> 01:25:09.487]  Trillions of dollars.
[01:25:09.487 --> 01:25:10.148]  Terry Duffy.
[01:25:10.148 --> 01:25:16.932]  A few weeks ago he was, you know, acting like we were crazy to say this stuff, even attacking Gerald Solente by name.
[01:25:16.932 --> 01:25:19.333]  Now he's come out and said no.
[01:25:19.333 --> 01:25:24.576]  Corzine did know, and our people were there, and I've given the names to the Justice Department.
[01:25:24.576 --> 01:25:28.798]  And see, he went off script there in that whole staged meeting, where none of them asked real questions.
[01:25:28.798 --> 01:25:29.779]  They all know that.
[01:25:30.916 --> 01:25:34.479]  They're all allowed to insider trade and say they're above the law in Congress.
[01:25:34.479 --> 01:25:37.261]  Let's go to the clip of it and get Max Geiser's take on it.
[01:25:37.261 --> 01:25:39.122]  Come back in a long segment and take calls.
[01:25:39.122 --> 01:25:41.844]  Here's that clip of the testimony yesterday.
[01:25:41.844 --> 01:25:43.645]  And this isn't just my interpretation.
[01:25:43.645 --> 01:25:46.828]  Here's Financial Times of London, the real globalist publication.
[01:25:46.828 --> 01:25:50.270]  CME chief alleges Corzine aware of transfers.
[01:25:50.270 --> 01:25:51.852]  That's what's sending gold and silver down.
[01:25:51.852 --> 01:25:55.094]  Because it's destroying the commodity end of it.
[01:25:55.094 --> 01:25:56.995]  But we're going to break that down in a moment.
[01:25:56.995 --> 01:25:57.536]  Here's the clip.
[01:25:58.675 --> 01:26:10.819]  CFTC and CME staff and auditors returned to the firm on Sunday, October 30th, and were informed by MF Global employees that this discrepancy was caused by, quote, an accounting error.
[01:26:10.819 --> 01:26:17.401]  Our auditors worked with the CFTC, devoted the rest of the day and night, Sunday, to find the so-called accounting error.
[01:26:17.401 --> 01:26:18.822]  No such error was ever found.
[01:26:19.725 --> 01:26:21.347]  Instead, at about 2 a.m.
[01:26:21.347 --> 01:26:36.868]  Monday morning, October 31st, MF Global informed both the CFTC and CME at approximately the same time that the shortfall was real and that customer segregated funds have been transferred out of segregation to the firm's broker-dealer accounts.
[01:26:37.916 --> 01:26:51.502]  After receiving this information, CME remained at MF Global while MF Global attempted to identify funds that could be transferred into segregation to reduce or eliminate the discrepancy.
[01:26:51.502 --> 01:27:05.528]  A CME auditor also participated in a phone call with senior MF Global employees wherein one employee indicated that Mr. Corzine knew about the loans that had been made from the customer segregated accounts.
[01:27:08.459 --> 01:27:13.544]  CME Group has provided this information.
[01:27:13.544 --> 01:27:17.487]  And then, uh, pause, back it up.
[01:27:17.487 --> 01:27:19.930]  Our video, for whatever reason, we're going to get new computers.
[01:27:19.930 --> 01:27:20.330]  It's saved.
[01:27:20.330 --> 01:27:21.091]  We're not editing it.
[01:27:21.091 --> 01:27:22.512]  It just is buffering.
[01:27:22.512 --> 01:27:24.454]  Back it up a few seconds and we'll try to play it there.
[01:27:24.454 --> 01:27:30.419]  I don't know why the computers do this, but go ahead and play it again.
[01:27:30.419 --> 01:27:33.062]  CME Group has provided this information.
[01:27:36.260 --> 01:27:43.028]  ...these individuals to the Department of Justice and the CFTC for investigating these matters.
[01:27:43.028 --> 01:27:45.632]  Oh, that must be on the C-SPAN video itself.
[01:27:45.632 --> 01:27:53.062]  Okay, so there you go, Max Keiser, and that's now on the record, and they just wanted to move on from that, didn't they?
[01:27:55.675 --> 01:28:01.521]  Well, he knew that when he said that, it would open a can of worms.
[01:28:01.521 --> 01:28:10.971]  It gives you a tick-tock, you know, the timeline of when Corzine got the call from Jamie over there at J.P.
[01:28:10.971 --> 01:28:12.012]  Morgan and threatened to kill him.
[01:28:12.972 --> 01:28:20.477]  Because after a few weeks, when the money wasn't showing up, he said, well, take it out of the customer money, or we'll kill you.
[01:28:20.477 --> 01:28:24.419]  So that's the timeline, and it's America, and that's the way business is done now.
[01:28:24.419 --> 01:28:28.822]  We've got killers who run big Wall Street firms, but that shouldn't be a surprise to anybody.
[01:28:28.822 --> 01:28:33.885]  And if you have any money in a brokerage firm or bank, you're an idiot, because it's now gone.
[01:28:33.885 --> 01:28:35.085]  There's no rule.
[01:28:35.085 --> 01:28:36.246]  Now, we'll see where this goes.
[01:28:36.246 --> 01:28:40.629]  I mean, this obviously, what will happen to this case is, in order
[01:28:41.678 --> 01:28:46.220]  To absolve the people, the crooks involved, they're going to need to pass some new laws very quickly.
[01:28:46.220 --> 01:28:53.544]  Obama, in reaction to this, and Holder, in reaction to this blatant law breaking, will pass new laws.
[01:28:53.544 --> 01:28:55.345]  That's been the history on Wall Street.
[01:28:55.345 --> 01:28:57.806]  If you get caught breaking the law, they pass new laws.
[01:28:57.806 --> 01:29:07.350]  Like Goldman Sachs passed a new law when they were caught breaking an SEC regulation about offering stock of Facebook to insiders beyond what's allowed by SEC law.
[01:29:07.350 --> 01:29:08.131]  So what do they do?
[01:29:08.131 --> 01:29:10.012]  They're getting Congress to pass a new law.
[01:29:10.612 --> 01:29:13.673]  When, uh, you just see examples of this every day.
[01:29:13.673 --> 01:29:16.975]  So, what I've- Instead of- Well, stay there, stay there, we gotta go to break.
[01:29:16.975 --> 01:29:20.776]  But instead of things getting better and enforcing the law, they just change it.
[01:29:20.776 --> 01:29:24.678]  Kind of like when Bush got caught spying without warrants on citizens, they changed the law.
[01:29:24.678 --> 01:29:33.081]  Or they get caught torturing, they try to- For telecom, telecom spying for years, Verizon and other telecom companies, they just gave them immunity.
[01:29:33.701 --> 01:29:38.723]  Okay, so they just give them immunity, or they'll change the law, and they'll say it's for national security.
[01:29:38.723 --> 01:29:39.704]  And then we'll move on.
[01:29:39.704 --> 01:29:41.725]  And they'll say, I don't want to focus on the past.
[01:29:41.725 --> 01:29:43.886]  Well, stay there then, but stay there.
[01:29:43.886 --> 01:29:47.768]  Because as you said, they've got the bank accounts all tied to derivatives.
[01:29:47.768 --> 01:29:50.149]  It's all gone.
[01:29:50.149 --> 01:29:51.529]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.529 --> 01:29:54.070]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.070 --> 01:29:56.732]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.331 --> 01:30:07.995]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:30:07.995 --> 01:30:13.139]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:30:13.139 --> 01:30:21.865]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:30:21.865 --> 01:30:24.346]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:30:24.346 --> 01:30:27.889]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[01:30:30.219 --> 01:30:34.941]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[01:30:34.941 --> 01:30:38.782]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[01:30:38.782 --> 01:30:40.023]  Others don't.
[01:30:40.023 --> 01:30:42.164]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:30:42.164 --> 01:30:43.945]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:30:43.945 --> 01:30:46.826]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:30:46.826 --> 01:30:53.468]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:30:53.468 --> 01:30:56.149]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:30:56.149 --> 01:30:58.530]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[01:30:58.530 --> 01:30:59.391]  Others don't.
[01:31:04.818 --> 01:31:06.079]  Tyranny is here.
[01:31:06.079 --> 01:31:09.621]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:31:09.621 --> 01:31:12.403]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:31:12.403 --> 01:31:18.106]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:31:18.106 --> 01:31:24.770]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:31:24.770 --> 01:31:30.754]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:31:30.754 --> 01:31:34.396]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:31:34.916 --> 01:31:39.219]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:31:39.219 --> 01:31:45.163]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:31:45.163 --> 01:31:48.725]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:31:48.725 --> 01:31:50.686]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:31:50.686 --> 01:31:51.827]  It's here.

[01:32:01.909 --> 01:32:03.611]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:32:03.611 --> 01:32:08.937]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:32:08.937 --> 01:32:10.459]  Saving means to make money.
[01:32:10.459 --> 01:32:19.249]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:32:19.970 --> 01:32:27.515]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:32:27.515 --> 01:32:35.520]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:32:35.520 --> 01:32:40.743]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:32:40.743 --> 01:32:42.924]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[01:33:09.876 --> 01:33:27.489]  Okay, I want to break down what comes next and what Max Keiser thinks the fallout from this is going to be, and then we'll take your calls for the balance of the hour.
[01:33:27.489 --> 01:33:31.713]  He's been very helpful and gracious to spend this much time with us today.
[01:33:33.217 --> 01:33:50.895]  Before I go back to Max Keiser of MaxKeiser.com, I wanted to remind everybody that you support this broadcast when you click on our sponsors and check out their great products at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com when you support the sponsors that you hear here nationally on the radio.
[01:33:52.017 --> 01:33:55.478]  And the sponsors that you hear on your local AM and FM stations.
[01:33:55.478 --> 01:33:56.738]  And it's key to do that.
[01:33:56.738 --> 01:33:57.899]  And I appreciate your support.
[01:33:57.899 --> 01:34:03.760]  We're having a big effect and we're risking our lives, our names, our treasure, our families in this fight.
[01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:08.802]  Because we realize tyranny cannot be bargained with.
[01:34:08.802 --> 01:34:13.483]  Certainly not when it's reached this stage four, like cancer.
[01:34:13.483 --> 01:34:17.524]  We've got a very slim chance of turning it around before the full implosion.
[01:34:17.524 --> 01:34:19.665]  It will turn around once it fully falls apart.
[01:34:21.670 --> 01:34:30.598]  So, now is the time to get the word out about the free podcast, and about the YouTube channel, and about the free audio streams, or about the local AM or FM you're listening to us on.
[01:34:30.598 --> 01:34:32.359]  America's in desperate straits, the world is.
[01:34:32.359 --> 01:34:41.167]  If you're listening right now, driving in your car, next red light you hit, roll it down and say, hey, tune to this AM or FM station, the station I'm on right now.
[01:34:42.076 --> 01:34:46.879]  Or if you're listening tonight, when you walk in that 7-Eleven or whatever, tell them, hey, tune in.
[01:34:46.879 --> 01:34:47.520]  Hear the truth.
[01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:48.901]  It's on right now.
[01:34:48.901 --> 01:34:50.582]  They're listening on XM.
[01:34:50.582 --> 01:34:51.102]  Same thing.
[01:34:51.102 --> 01:34:53.944]  Tell people that you see in parking lots, hey, have you got XM?
[01:34:53.944 --> 01:34:54.825]  Tune to this channel.
[01:34:54.825 --> 01:34:57.026]  People are like, that's so alien to do that.
[01:34:57.026 --> 01:35:00.929]  No, we've become alien to American culture of liberty.
[01:35:00.929 --> 01:35:02.910]  It's time to just get the buzz going.
[01:35:02.910 --> 01:35:11.636]  How many police officers call here that have woken up and say they woke up because somebody told them five years ago about Infowars.com or gave them a copy of one of my films?
[01:35:12.736 --> 01:35:15.839]  We're reaching more than 15 million people a week now.
[01:35:15.839 --> 01:35:17.159]  It's growing fast.
[01:35:17.159 --> 01:35:19.101]  And believe me, I'm on the globalist radar.
[01:35:19.101 --> 01:35:20.342]  I'm on the White House enemies list.
[01:35:20.342 --> 01:35:21.703]  That's come out in the news.
[01:35:21.703 --> 01:35:24.625]  The White House has responded to articles we've put out.
[01:35:24.625 --> 01:35:25.645]  We're having an effect.
[01:35:25.645 --> 01:35:26.946]  You better believe it.
[01:35:26.946 --> 01:35:28.547]  We're on the Drugs Report every week now.
[01:35:28.547 --> 01:35:29.788]  Twice yesterday.
[01:35:29.788 --> 01:35:30.449]  Two different articles.
[01:35:31.309 --> 01:35:34.432]  And I pray for protection.
[01:35:34.432 --> 01:35:35.833]  I pray for your prayers.
[01:35:35.833 --> 01:35:37.034]  But it's all in God's hands.
[01:35:37.034 --> 01:35:38.436]  I'm not living in fear.
[01:35:38.436 --> 01:35:40.618]  They kill me tomorrow, set me up, whatever.
[01:35:40.618 --> 01:35:41.819]  They've got to be facedown.
[01:35:41.819 --> 01:35:43.620]  These are really bad people.
[01:35:43.620 --> 01:35:46.483]  And I want to encourage you this Christmas to give the gift of truth.
[01:35:46.483 --> 01:35:49.486]  Even if you don't celebrate Christmas, it's a great excuse to wake somebody up.
[01:35:50.472 --> 01:35:52.875]  You can get all 18 of my films on DVD.
[01:35:52.875 --> 01:35:56.460]  All 18 for $99.95 and it ends at the end of the month.
[01:35:56.460 --> 01:35:59.784]  If you order by Sunday evening, it's guaranteed shipped anywhere in the U.S.
[01:35:59.784 --> 01:36:00.905]  before Christmas.
[01:36:00.905 --> 01:36:04.089]  InfoWars.com, the Alex Jones Everything Special.
[01:36:04.089 --> 01:36:08.315]  You can get 18 gifts for people and not fight the crowds or buy stuff you don't need.
[01:36:09.505 --> 01:36:13.347]  So again, InfoWars.com, the online shopping cart, or 888-253-3139, or get it in the mail today.
[01:36:13.347 --> 01:36:14.608]  It should get here.
[01:36:14.608 --> 01:36:16.449]  PO Box 19549, Austin, Texas, 78760.
[01:36:16.449 --> 01:36:17.330]  PO Box 19549, Austin, Texas, 78760.
[01:36:26.755 --> 01:36:33.460]  Then again, when I plug sponsors or videos, it's all things I believe in, and it's all things that fund this operation.
[01:36:33.460 --> 01:36:38.944]  Fueling the tanks on our weapons system to go out and expose the globalists some more.
[01:36:38.944 --> 01:36:42.566]  But the most important thing is keep spreading the word about the broadcast.
[01:36:42.566 --> 01:36:43.907]  It's working.
[01:36:43.907 --> 01:36:45.228]  It's working.
[01:36:45.228 --> 01:36:47.169]  That's why all my films are online for free.
[01:36:47.169 --> 01:36:50.231]  You can buy them on DVD in high quality if you want, but they're all there.
[01:36:50.231 --> 01:36:52.473]  Obama Deception, Follow the Republic, Endgame.
[01:36:52.473 --> 01:36:53.073]  Get the links.
[01:36:54.008 --> 01:36:54.948]  Get them out to people.
[01:36:54.948 --> 01:36:55.809]  Don't know how to find them?
[01:36:55.809 --> 01:36:56.469]  Search it.
[01:36:56.469 --> 01:36:59.230]  Now, I want to go to calls, but going back to Max Keiser.
[01:36:59.230 --> 01:37:03.332]  Max, the seismic shift, and I'm going to put it on screen here for presentplanet.tv viewers.
[01:37:03.332 --> 01:37:06.093]  London Telegraph, last Thursday.
[01:37:06.093 --> 01:37:12.756]  Portugal raids pension funds to meet deficit targets, admits that it's private pension funds.
[01:37:12.756 --> 01:37:15.758]  They can always argue, oh, government pension funds is welfare.
[01:37:16.724 --> 01:37:17.665]  Not even paying into it.
[01:37:17.665 --> 01:37:19.626]  They're already rating those.
[01:37:19.626 --> 01:37:26.110]  But the government's taken it and shaved, depending on which fund it was, 10 to 20 or even more percentage off.
[01:37:26.110 --> 01:37:33.635]  And they say, the government now holds your fund in trust and gave it to Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and some of the other European banks.
[01:37:33.635 --> 01:37:35.977]  But obviously, I was going to ask you, where is it going?
[01:37:35.977 --> 01:37:38.419]  The fact that they don't care that
[01:37:39.379 --> 01:37:47.428]  The public's now learning that bank accounts, brokerage accounts, 401k, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, these indexes, nothing's there.
[01:37:47.428 --> 01:37:52.854]  There's hundreds of times derivatives fraud to what real assets are.
[01:37:52.854 --> 01:37:57.219]  As you and other economists we've had on have all basically admitted on the same spectrum.
[01:37:58.019 --> 01:37:59.761]  100 times, 200 times, people debate it.
[01:37:59.761 --> 01:38:06.567]  The point is, they've signed us onto their fraud, the military's standing by to wage war with us, and the question is, will they stand down?
[01:38:06.567 --> 01:38:08.729]  And so, what comes next?
[01:38:08.729 --> 01:38:13.693]  I guess they just destroy confidence, they don't care, they take it all over and the military stands by?
[01:38:13.693 --> 01:38:16.276]  I mean, is that what's going to happen, Max Keiser?
[01:38:17.742 --> 01:38:30.535]  Look, they just rack up huge debts, speculating, and then when it comes time to pay the debt, they raid a pension account, or they raid your commodities account, or they'll steal your mutual funds, or your bank account.
[01:38:30.535 --> 01:38:33.418]  So there's nobody trying to stop them from racking up these debts.
[01:38:33.418 --> 01:38:33.859]  In Europe,
[01:38:35.180 --> 01:38:39.782]  Economy in the banking system is collapsing, but the speculators are still racking up more debts.
[01:38:39.782 --> 01:38:51.325]  If you notice, the Bank of International Settlements came out with a report just a couple of weeks ago that indicated that the total amount of derivatives in the global banking system has reached a new all-time high of $720 trillion.
[01:38:53.326 --> 01:39:00.732]  Remember after the crisis of 2008, that number decreased by 50 or 60 trillion dollars for temporarily.
[01:39:00.732 --> 01:39:13.323]  But now, since nobody did anything to make any laws or to put anybody in jail, and in fact all the speculators thought that they were being rewarded for doing such a great job endangering the global economy, they have increased the total number of...
[01:39:15.233 --> 01:39:17.934]  That's $200 trillion.
[01:39:17.934 --> 01:39:26.316]  So anytime that they need to pay any interest, again, it's very small because interest rates are near zero, but they do, they still have interest on $700 trillion.
[01:39:26.316 --> 01:39:31.278]  It's still, even if it's .001%, it still is a meaningful amount on that amount.
[01:39:31.278 --> 01:39:33.759]  So they will raise your pension account.
[01:39:33.759 --> 01:39:35.439]  They'll steal from your brokerage account.
[01:39:35.439 --> 01:39:37.620]  And you know, Jamie Dimon over there, JP Morgan,
[01:39:38.581 --> 01:39:42.887]  That bank alone has $90 trillion in derivatives on their books.
[01:39:42.887 --> 01:39:47.573]  That's bigger than the total GDP of the entire world.
[01:39:47.573 --> 01:39:51.498]  The entire global GDP is, let's call it, $60 trillion.
[01:39:51.498 --> 01:39:53.961]  JP Morgan has derivatives on their books for $90 trillion.
[01:39:55.643 --> 01:39:58.905]  And they say, well, it's not risk, really, because it's perfectly hedged.
[01:39:58.905 --> 01:40:01.647]  All the counterparties are completely safe.
[01:40:01.647 --> 01:40:03.608]  Yeah, look what just happened for them at Global.
[01:40:03.608 --> 01:40:05.769]  There's no counterparty accountability there.
[01:40:05.769 --> 01:40:07.310]  Look what happened during 2008.
[01:40:07.310 --> 01:40:09.632]  There were no counterparties' accountability there.
[01:40:09.632 --> 01:40:10.832]  There's gross risk.
[01:40:10.832 --> 01:40:11.993]  It's not net risk.
[01:40:11.993 --> 01:40:13.734]  That's 90 trillion in risk.
[01:40:13.734 --> 01:40:15.175]  They're not hedged at all.
[01:40:15.175 --> 01:40:18.857]  And how can you hedge, you know, 700 trillion in bets on an economy this way?
[01:40:18.857 --> 01:40:20.078]  But here's the question.
[01:40:20.078 --> 01:40:20.919]  Here's the question.
[01:40:21.699 --> 01:40:30.684]  As the firemen, the police, the bureaucrats lose their future, will they, the police, still not care that they've been robbed just because they can still crack somebody on the head?
[01:40:30.684 --> 01:40:32.506]  I mean, that's really what's valuable.
[01:40:32.506 --> 01:40:37.188]  Or is there, I mean, is there any end from your research to how bad this is going to get?
[01:40:37.188 --> 01:40:43.652]  Because certainly they have a escape route, and that's more power, world government, total tyranny in their own words.
[01:40:43.652 --> 01:40:47.795]  But, I mean, they've got a problem, as Zbigniew Brzezinski said last year,
[01:40:48.695 --> 01:40:57.385]  To the Council on Foreign Relations in Canada, their branch, he said, look, the world is awake and staring at the elite, not at our puppets anymore.
[01:40:57.385 --> 01:40:59.367]  We're in deep trouble.
[01:40:59.367 --> 01:41:05.254]  So even their own technocrats are warning them that they're not going to get away with this, even if they start World War III.
[01:41:05.254 --> 01:41:08.117]  That isn't going to make people circle the wagons around the little bankers.
[01:41:10.013 --> 01:41:17.663]  Well, what they count on is the response you see in almost all incidents of rape.
[01:41:17.663 --> 01:41:20.306]  Rape victims tend to blame themselves.
[01:41:20.306 --> 01:41:21.868]  And this is what the elites count on.
[01:41:21.868 --> 01:41:24.993]  They know that if they steal all your money, you're going to blame yourself.
[01:41:25.513 --> 01:41:28.334]  I know working on Wall Street myself, that was the attitude.
[01:41:28.334 --> 01:41:35.035]  When I call up a customer and I tell them, hey, I just lost all of your money, typically the customer will blame themselves.
[01:41:35.035 --> 01:41:36.635]  And this is what people count on.
[01:41:36.635 --> 01:41:39.336]  I know when I was working on Wall Street, this is what we found.
[01:41:39.336 --> 01:41:43.037]  We try to find customers that were gambler-holics.
[01:41:43.037 --> 01:41:48.358]  We try to find emotionally weak customers that will blame themselves for the money you steal from them.
[01:41:48.678 --> 01:41:51.039]  And this is what they do, but on a much bigger scale.
[01:41:51.039 --> 01:42:04.484]  So a pension account that's worth a few hundred million, if they steal two or three million or four billion, the pension manager will feel bad about themselves and they'll put their tail between their legs and they'll scurry home to wherever they're living, a little hovel.
[01:42:04.864 --> 01:42:07.927]  And they'll cry to themselves to sleep all night.
[01:42:07.927 --> 01:42:10.350]  But that's what you count on, because nobody's going to stand up to you.
[01:42:10.350 --> 01:42:10.550]  Oh, I know.
[01:42:10.550 --> 01:42:16.836]  I've seen when the government takes people's children for no reason, they'll still somehow blame themselves.
[01:42:16.836 --> 01:42:20.680]  And I see this psychology all the time.
[01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:22.442]  I mean, it really is the Stockholm Syndrome.
[01:42:23.317 --> 01:42:31.422]  Well, it's just, you know, the thing is, you learn on Wall Street, when I was on Wall Street, what I was told was a couple of things.
[01:42:31.422 --> 01:42:36.064]  First of all, it doesn't matter if you break the law, because we have lawyers, you know.
[01:42:36.064 --> 01:42:42.968]  And second of all, unless you have at least one case pending against you from a disgruntled customer, you're not showing enough initiative.
[01:42:44.580 --> 01:42:46.361]  I mean, that's the law of the Wall Street.
[01:42:46.361 --> 01:42:51.684]  And the way you're paid on Wall Street is not on the money you make for customers, but on the churn factor.
[01:42:51.684 --> 01:42:56.466]  How much of the customer's money did you turn into the firm's money?
[01:42:56.466 --> 01:42:58.728]  And you do that by excessive trading.
[01:42:58.728 --> 01:43:06.332]  And typically, brokers will churn customers and they'll turn it over and turn 10 or 20% of the customer's account.
[01:43:06.332 --> 01:43:08.373]  And the most criminal rise to the top
[01:43:11.075 --> 01:43:15.181]  And they think the police state's going to protect them from the crimes they've committed.
[01:43:15.181 --> 01:43:16.402]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[01:43:16.402 --> 01:43:24.454]  If you just joined us, the head of the CME group, this is big, big news, Terrence Duffy,
[01:43:25.956 --> 01:43:36.639]  Has gone public and said that he was told, and he told the Justice Department this, in meetings with MF Global, Top Brass, that they were ordered by Corzine to steal the private bank accounts.
[01:43:36.639 --> 01:43:38.639]  This is bank robbery digital.
[01:43:38.639 --> 01:43:49.122]  And you're seeing a giant attempt by MF Global and by JP Morgan reportedly, who got most of the money, to just have it in plain view and see if you'll buy it.
[01:43:49.702 --> 01:43:58.053]  And the Justice Department and the rest of these terrorists who ship guns to Mexico and cocaine into the country and get caught, they don't get in trouble either.
[01:43:58.053 --> 01:44:00.016]  Just to see if they can get away with this.
[01:44:00.016 --> 01:44:05.363]  And I want to go to calls here, Max, but that point you raised about the goal, we'll have to cover that.
[01:44:06.184 --> 01:44:10.226]  After we get to some calls, because that's destroying the commodities market in gold and silver.
[01:44:10.226 --> 01:44:13.587]  But the last time they did that six months ago or five months ago, it only came back up after.
[01:44:13.587 --> 01:44:15.488]  So we'll get your view on the future of that here.
[01:44:15.488 --> 01:44:18.909]  But right now, let's go ahead and talk to George in Connecticut.
[01:44:18.909 --> 01:44:20.090]  You're on the air with Max Keiser.
[01:44:20.090 --> 01:44:20.630]  Thanks for holding.
[01:44:21.824 --> 01:44:25.765]  I have a question for Max, but I also have some hope for you.
[01:44:25.765 --> 01:44:27.366]  I'll give you the hope quick.
[01:44:27.366 --> 01:44:41.789]  I was listening to a very left-wing New York station, and it was an Occupy Wall Street, and they're talking about Ron Paul, and there's lots of people giving upbeat things, so there's the hope that there may be a joining at some point.
[01:44:41.789 --> 01:44:47.491]  The question for Max, though, is that I'm wondering, every time they drive down Gold and Silver,
[01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:48.800]  I don't know.
[01:45:08.291 --> 01:45:09.612]  Yeah, that's what's happening.
[01:45:09.612 --> 01:45:10.453]  That's what people are doing.
[01:45:10.453 --> 01:45:18.360]  They're getting out of the paper gold, which includes GLD and SLV, and they're buying the physical gold and silver.
[01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:19.321]  And that's what's happening.
[01:45:19.321 --> 01:45:23.225]  And the demand for gold and silver is still extraordinarily high all around the world.
[01:45:23.225 --> 01:45:25.046]  So yeah, they're shifting out of the paper.
[01:45:25.046 --> 01:45:26.668]  They're moving into the physical.
[01:45:26.668 --> 01:45:30.932]  And at some point, the physical will start to be traded at quotes.
[01:45:30.932 --> 01:45:33.955]  They'll be priced completely separate from the paper.
[01:45:34.415 --> 01:45:35.597]  So you'll have two markets.
[01:45:35.597 --> 01:45:40.704]  You'll have the physical market, we'll be trading at one price, and then they'll have the paper market trading at a completely different price.
[01:45:40.704 --> 01:45:42.826]  And so are you looking for a boomerang?
[01:45:42.826 --> 01:45:49.155]  Because it'll go down for a while as the paper market collapses, which is happening, because no one trusts MF Global.
[01:45:49.155 --> 01:45:50.737]  I guess that's why the head of it...
[01:45:52.429 --> 01:46:01.664]  The head of the CME Group is having to come out and cry uncle because they do see it literally across commodities markets are going down because of loss of confidence.
[01:46:01.664 --> 01:46:06.472]  Then I guess as everybody then rushes into physical, could that push it then up a lot?
[01:46:07.552 --> 01:46:09.853]  Well, yeah, also strong hands.
[01:46:09.853 --> 01:46:12.533]  These are physical cash buyers.
[01:46:12.533 --> 01:46:17.155]  The world is moving in a very stealthy fashion to a gold standard.
[01:46:17.155 --> 01:46:19.536]  You know, gold vending machines are now all over the world.
[01:46:19.536 --> 01:46:24.057]  People own gold and we're becoming a gold-oriented society.
[01:46:24.577 --> 01:46:31.840]  The central bank's trying to avoid that from happening by increasing margin accounts, by screwing around GLD.
[01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:36.161]  They're bringing in a stealth gold standard anyway, so they're hoisted by their own guitar.
[01:46:36.161 --> 01:46:41.243]  They don't understand that this is not stopping people from buying gold and silver.
[01:46:41.243 --> 01:46:45.725]  And my target of $5,000 on gold is the same as it was seven years ago, eight years ago.
[01:46:45.725 --> 01:46:46.925]  I haven't changed that target.
[01:46:47.265 --> 01:46:51.948]  Sure, we've seen him drive it down many times and it's the same game.
[01:46:51.948 --> 01:46:52.948]  George, thank you for the call.
[01:46:52.948 --> 01:46:53.969]  Good points.
[01:46:53.969 --> 01:46:54.949]  Good question.
[01:46:54.949 --> 01:46:57.010]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chuck in Virginia.
[01:46:57.010 --> 01:46:58.911]  You're on the air, Chuck.
[01:46:58.911 --> 01:46:59.551]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:46:59.551 --> 01:47:00.292]  Thank you, Max.
[01:47:00.292 --> 01:47:16.200]  My question is, using Max's analogy earlier, with JPMorgan putting a gun in Corzine's head, when America leaves China hanging with the $2 trillion in debt, do you think China will put a gun to America's head by virtue of like a Chinese Red Dawn?
[01:47:19.549 --> 01:47:26.333]  Well, I think that you already have incredible influence in American policy from China.
[01:47:26.333 --> 01:47:32.676]  Certainly in the monetary policy and in the financial policies, China's got incredible influence.
[01:47:32.676 --> 01:47:39.900]  And going forward, we see China lining themselves up with Iran and Russia more than the United States.
[01:47:39.900 --> 01:47:47.604]  So that block of countries, Iran, China, Russia, are consolidating their relationships and doing lots of deals together.
[01:47:48.104 --> 01:47:52.526]  And so the US, of course, is sticking with Britain and Israel.
[01:47:52.526 --> 01:47:58.128]  I mean, that's going to be the loser going forward against China, Russia, Iran.
[01:47:58.128 --> 01:47:59.229]  I mean, think about it.
[01:47:59.229 --> 01:48:00.990]  They've got all the oil and gas.
[01:48:00.990 --> 01:48:03.271]  They've got all the gold and silver.
[01:48:03.271 --> 01:48:04.111]  They've got all the money.
[01:48:04.491 --> 01:48:05.852]  So who are you going to make a bet?
[01:48:05.852 --> 01:48:08.673]  China, Russia, Iran or America and Israel?
[01:48:08.673 --> 01:48:17.618]  America and Israel and England run by the most larcenous con men undoubtedly the world has ever seen.
[01:48:17.618 --> 01:48:29.104]  William K. Black agrees, others, the greatest fraud ever and they're waging war against our own countries from Israel to the US are all occupied by basically military dictatorships with a little fake government.
[01:48:29.944 --> 01:48:42.754]  out front and you're right Russia and China and others were heavily invested especially China they wanted to be part of the new world order they were offered and now they've been sold derivatives and crud so their president is threatening war with the U.S.
[01:48:42.754 --> 01:48:54.223]  now in Reuters but it's not even on the nightly news I mean that shows you how crazy the world's gotten and that even the Communist Party of China is now freaked out about who's running the U.S.
[01:48:54.223 --> 01:48:55.784]  because these bankers are so
[01:48:56.545 --> 01:49:01.502]  Are so sure of themselves, are so humorous, drunk, that who knows what they'll do?
[01:49:03.331 --> 01:49:04.892]  Well, I'm in that camp.
[01:49:04.892 --> 01:49:10.754]  And they've got the resources, they're in Africa securing resources, in the case of China, where the U.S.
[01:49:10.754 --> 01:49:14.895]  is blowing money on weapons to try to secure energy resources.
[01:49:14.895 --> 01:49:16.936]  It's a completely inefficient way to do that.
[01:49:16.936 --> 01:49:22.017]  And the next world war is not going to be fought with tanks and rockets, it's a currency war.
[01:49:22.017 --> 01:49:23.958]  And it's going to be fought with derivatives.
[01:49:23.958 --> 01:49:30.140]  And countries with actual resources behind these derivatives are going to do better than the U.S., which is just, and the U.K.
[01:49:30.140 --> 01:49:31.901]  and Israel, they're just printing debt.
[01:49:32.361 --> 01:49:37.865]  So it's going to be debt versus real resources, and I think real resources are going to prevail.
[01:49:37.865 --> 01:49:46.933]  And by the way, that's why, and I've told people this for a decade or more, from the manuals, the drills, I've documented it, but now they're admitting they are lining up the U.S.
[01:49:46.933 --> 01:49:49.314]  military after farmers and ranchers.
[01:49:49.314 --> 01:49:52.817]  That's who they trained to take on, and that's who they're now using predator drones on.
[01:49:52.817 --> 01:49:55.980]  I mean, why are they so scared of farmers and ranchers, Max?
[01:49:58.462 --> 01:50:04.409]  Well, I guess because they're afraid of anybody who's independent in any way.
[01:50:04.409 --> 01:50:11.497]  Farmers and ranchers are independent because they have an independent source of income and they're not reliant on the government to that extent.
[01:50:11.497 --> 01:50:15.983]  So that's obviously a threat to the central planners in Washington.
[01:50:17.523 --> 01:50:21.344]  Wow, we're going to come back, and I'm going to keep you until 5 after, and we're going to let you go for a whole hour.
[01:50:21.344 --> 01:50:26.326]  Into the next, we're going to have a very interesting guest in studio with us.
[01:50:26.326 --> 01:50:28.046]  Max Keiser is our guest.
[01:50:28.046 --> 01:50:32.808]  We're going to break, but just briefly, Max, when do you expect gold to go back up?
[01:50:34.895 --> 01:50:43.562]  Well, you know, that's the timing on gold and silver is something that people should stop trying to time it.
[01:50:43.562 --> 01:50:48.146]  And I've always said the best way is to give yourself a dollar cost averaging.
[01:50:48.146 --> 01:50:51.168]  So every month you go in with the same amount of money.
[01:50:51.168 --> 01:50:57.193]  So here this month, when it's being attacked, you go in with that same amount of money and you're going to end up buying more.
[01:50:57.193 --> 01:50:57.933]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:57.933 --> 01:50:58.474]  Stay there, Max.
[01:51:03.056 --> 01:51:08.198]  From the shattered Rust Belt come The Lost Vegas.
[01:51:08.198 --> 01:51:12.881]  Now also available in digital format at Amazon and iTunes worldwide.
[01:51:12.881 --> 01:51:21.445]  Don't come callin' when you won't stop callin' Don't come callin' when you won't stop callin' I got a little bit of respect, don't take it away
[01:51:24.850 --> 01:51:25.431]  I think.
[01:51:39.835 --> 01:51:53.429]  Life Before the Collapse by The Lost Vegas on 180 gram vinyl and mastered especially for vinyl by legendary audio engineer Steve Hall.
[01:51:53.429 --> 01:51:56.091]  Life Before the Collapse by The Lost Vegas.
[01:52:00.753 --> 01:52:05.214]  You don't need me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis.
[01:52:05.214 --> 01:52:06.694]  Everyone can feel it.
[01:52:06.694 --> 01:52:15.575]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[01:52:15.575 --> 01:52:18.756]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising.
[01:52:18.756 --> 01:52:19.916]  But take heart.
[01:52:19.916 --> 01:52:23.497]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[01:52:23.837 --> 01:52:29.259]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war.
[01:52:29.259 --> 01:52:33.100]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[01:52:33.100 --> 01:52:34.821]  The globalists are scared.
[01:52:34.821 --> 01:52:36.161]  They've overreached.
[01:52:36.161 --> 01:52:39.683]  The future of the info war is in your hands.

[01:54:12.585 --> 01:54:17.449]  Is it getting better?
[01:54:17.449 --> 01:54:22.773]  Or do you feel the same?
[01:54:22.773 --> 01:54:26.396]  Will it make it easier on you now?
[01:54:26.396 --> 01:54:29.498]  You've got someone to blame.
[01:54:29.498 --> 01:54:34.862]  Gunter Spence is going to be joining us coming up at 8 after.
[01:54:36.002 --> 01:54:44.544]  He was a colonel in the East German military and was part of the stand-down that basically led to the fall of Berlin Wall.
[01:54:44.544 --> 01:54:45.845]  He's going to be in studio with us.
[01:54:45.845 --> 01:54:49.685]  I appreciate him traveling from where he lives in Texas to Austin.
[01:54:49.685 --> 01:54:50.266]  That's coming up.
[01:54:50.266 --> 01:54:56.087]  We've got two segments left with Max Keiser, this short one, and one more short one to go to phone calls here.
[01:54:56.087 --> 01:55:02.209]  And let's go ahead and go to Info in Maryland.
[01:55:02.209 --> 01:55:03.269]  You're on the air, Info.
[01:55:05.080 --> 01:55:08.842]  Uh, hi Alex, how are you doing?
[01:55:08.842 --> 01:55:14.445]  I kind of agree with Max Keiser about the whole MF Global thing with Corzine.
[01:55:14.445 --> 01:55:24.630]  The fact that he was able, the fact that he had to lie because, you know, his family might be in danger and they have a gun to his head and stuff like that.
[01:55:24.630 --> 01:55:27.512]  I mean, what could you absolutely do?
[01:55:29.167 --> 01:55:30.668]  I appreciate your call.
[01:55:30.668 --> 01:55:33.450]  We have to expose these criminals.
[01:55:33.450 --> 01:55:36.511]  It's a moral issue and this is an educational thing.
[01:55:36.511 --> 01:55:41.434]  It shows us that our government is criminal and out of control and illegitimate and that we need to fix it.
[01:55:41.434 --> 01:55:42.535]  Max Keiser, your comment.
[01:55:43.857 --> 01:55:45.618]  It's a replay of Enron.
[01:55:45.618 --> 01:55:46.859]  Remember Enron?
[01:55:46.859 --> 01:55:49.461]  Famously, we learned about the special purpose entity accounts.
[01:55:49.461 --> 01:55:53.665]  Over 700 off-balance sheet accounts that they used to fund their fraud.
[01:55:53.665 --> 01:55:56.467]  Now we're learning about hypothecation and re-hypothecation.
[01:55:56.467 --> 01:55:58.248]  It's essentially the same game.
[01:55:58.248 --> 01:56:00.930]  After Enron, I think their chairman blew his head off.
[01:56:00.930 --> 01:56:03.312]  He killed himself, I believe.
[01:56:03.312 --> 01:56:04.633]  Somebody else went to jail.
[01:56:04.633 --> 01:56:06.554]  The stock went to zero.
[01:56:06.554 --> 01:56:08.196]  $80 billion got wiped out.
[01:56:08.196 --> 01:56:09.357]  The case of J.P.
[01:56:09.357 --> 01:56:09.697]  Morgan?
[01:56:09.697 --> 01:56:10.938]  I think we're going to see the same thing.
[01:56:11.238 --> 01:56:15.982]  Chairman can blow his head off, stock goes to zero, someone's going to go to jail.
[01:56:15.982 --> 01:56:17.764]  It's a replay.
[01:56:17.764 --> 01:56:19.805]  But much bigger.
[01:56:19.805 --> 01:56:22.107]  It's a $160 billion company.
[01:56:22.107 --> 01:56:23.348]  Enron was $80 billion.
[01:56:23.348 --> 01:56:25.770]  So on a pure stock play, it's twice as big.
[01:56:25.770 --> 01:56:28.152]  But it's systemically glued into the system.
[01:56:28.152 --> 01:56:31.335]  Yeah, but that's the side issue because it's the derivatives.
[01:56:31.335 --> 01:56:34.258]  The Ponzi scheme has infected everything.
[01:56:34.258 --> 01:56:39.162]  And so we're basically talking about the bullet that shot a hole in us instead of talking about the bullet hole.
[01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:40.840]  Well, J.P.
[01:56:40.840 --> 01:56:44.842]  Morgan, of course, their debts are not held on their balance sheets.
[01:56:44.842 --> 01:56:47.084]  Their debts are held by the Fed.
[01:56:47.084 --> 01:56:48.644]  So if Jamie Dimon and J.P.
[01:56:48.644 --> 01:56:50.845]  Morgan blows up, so does the Fed.
[01:56:50.845 --> 01:56:52.346]  A lot of people will cheer that.
[01:56:52.346 --> 01:56:54.387]  Of course, even Ron Paul will cheer that.
[01:56:54.387 --> 01:56:57.569]  He'll say that's probably the greatest thing that could happen, is for J.P.
[01:56:57.569 --> 01:57:05.573]  Morgan and the Fed to simply blow themselves up, which would be a nice end to a 100-year run as a vicious financial crook in this country.
[01:57:06.903 --> 01:57:11.908]  We're going to go to break and come back with three or four more calls and then let Max Keiser go and bring in our next guest who's going to be in studio.
[01:57:11.908 --> 01:57:12.669]  But here's a headline.
[01:57:12.669 --> 01:57:17.134]  Ron Paul outlines his campaign secret weapon on the radio show with us yesterday.
[01:57:17.134 --> 01:57:19.116]  Steve Watson has an article on that.
[01:57:19.116 --> 01:57:21.679]  He's now in a dead tie with Newt Gingrich.
[01:57:21.679 --> 01:57:25.823]  And as people learn how dirty Gingrich is, he is falling like a rock.
[01:57:25.823 --> 01:57:27.285]  Now your view on Newt Gingrich.
[01:57:28.995 --> 01:57:29.995]  You know, I'm in Europe.
[01:57:29.995 --> 01:57:31.436]  I've been here for 10 years now.
[01:57:31.436 --> 01:57:33.216]  I've been living in France for 14 years.
[01:57:33.216 --> 01:57:38.258]  I don't follow regional, local, little American elections that closely.
[01:57:38.258 --> 01:57:39.758]  I mean, Ron Paul's a great guy.
[01:57:39.758 --> 01:57:40.678]  I hope he does well.
[01:57:40.678 --> 01:57:42.979]  But other than that, it's a too small a country.
[01:57:42.979 --> 01:57:45.920]  Yeah, the point is, is that look at who the Republicans put forward.
[01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:48.181]  I mean, this is a top globalist minion.
[01:57:48.181 --> 01:57:52.822]  This is a Mr. Selling Influence, Mr. Crooked.
[01:57:54.277 --> 01:57:57.218]  He moves like a weather vane, depending on how the wind blows.
[01:57:57.218 --> 01:58:00.778]  And that's who Ron Paul, the statesman, has to fight with.
[01:58:00.778 --> 01:58:04.459]  I mean, it should be a no-brainer, Max.
[01:58:04.459 --> 01:58:09.200]  Yeah, well, you're talking about voters in a country where there are very few brains.
[01:58:09.200 --> 01:58:13.681]  So, I mean, they constantly vote for the deadbeats and charlatans.
[01:58:13.681 --> 01:58:19.762]  So, you know, hopefully they'll maybe choose somebody that's capable this time, but I wouldn't hold my breath.
[01:58:21.567 --> 01:58:31.735]  Well, one thing's for sure, Ron Paul can't fix everything, but he's a major signal worldwide, as he said yesterday, that we're going in the right direction again, or that we're trying to turn the ship around.
[01:58:31.735 --> 01:58:38.320]  But, my goodness, if we get any of the other candidates, Obama, Romney, Gingrich, heaven help us.
[01:58:38.320 --> 01:58:41.523]  Stay with us.

[02:00:24.966 --> 02:00:36.589]  Gunter Spenz, former colonel in the East German Army, gonna be in studio with us, and he was part of the group that stood down and led to the fall of the Berlin Wall, and that's what we're coming to here.
[02:00:36.589 --> 02:00:40.150]  The globalists are just gonna get more and more corrupt until they fall.
[02:00:40.150 --> 02:00:43.291]  The question is, will they crush us in the process?
[02:00:43.291 --> 02:00:45.292]  I think we're doing a pretty good job, though, Max.
[02:00:45.292 --> 02:00:47.132]  I see a lot of people waking up.
[02:00:47.132 --> 02:00:49.253]  Briefly, your statement on that, and we'll take some more calls.
[02:00:50.626 --> 02:00:58.733]  Well you know Alex, this is why God invented the guillotine.
[02:00:58.733 --> 02:00:59.933]  So that's the long and short of it.
[02:00:59.933 --> 02:01:02.556]  Let's go to Freedom Lover in Florida.
[02:01:02.556 --> 02:01:04.017]  You're on the air with Max Keiser.
[02:01:04.017 --> 02:01:07.379]  Hi, thanks for taking my call.
[02:01:07.379 --> 02:01:09.041]  I listen to both of you all the time.
[02:01:09.041 --> 02:01:15.406]  I was wondering, well one statement I want to make and then I have a couple questions.
[02:01:15.406 --> 02:01:19.169]  What I would think would be a great ticket with Ron Paul personally would be Peter Schiff.
[02:01:19.818 --> 02:01:22.941]  I think he would be a great running mate.
[02:01:22.941 --> 02:01:41.418]  Having said that, I wanted to know, Max, is there validity behind a statement that Mike Dillard of the Elevation Group made that 144 tons of gold was supposed to be sent to Libya from the New York Fed, and that's actually what got Gaddafi assassinated?
[02:01:41.418 --> 02:01:44.201]  And also, if I could just follow up with you, Alex.
[02:01:45.388 --> 02:01:52.172]  What do you mean, personally, when you say that you see a turnaround after, like, the final clampdown occurs?
[02:01:52.172 --> 02:01:56.235]  Well, I mean, things are going to have to get really bad before people start really waking up.
[02:01:56.235 --> 02:02:02.639]  People are starting to wake up now because things are bad, but they have no idea, historically, how guaranteed crazy this is going to get.
[02:02:02.639 --> 02:02:11.284]  But yes, it's true that, from what I read, I don't know about the particular guy you mentioned, that Libya was demanding delivery of its gold, and we know Venezuela has now done that.
[02:02:11.284 --> 02:02:11.805]  Max Keiser.
[02:02:13.678 --> 02:02:21.082]  The thing about Libya was, of course, the second they let Tony Blair into the country, the country was doomed.
[02:02:21.082 --> 02:02:24.444]  He got JP Morgan to manage their pension accounts, lost 98%.
[02:02:24.444 --> 02:02:29.186]  Got Goldman Sachs to come in and manage some sovereign wealth money, they lost something like 80%.
[02:02:30.327 --> 02:02:32.709]  They totally bankrupted the country within six months.
[02:02:32.709 --> 02:02:36.372]  This is what killed Libya because Tony Blair introduced them.
[02:02:36.372 --> 02:02:43.858]  Of course, Tony Blair went from governing Britain to going on JPMorgan's board of directors and cutting deals in the Mideast.
[02:02:43.858 --> 02:02:46.881]  And Gaddafi thought that they really wanted to be his friends.
[02:02:46.881 --> 02:02:48.983]  Talk about becoming a delusional dictator.
[02:02:49.670 --> 02:02:51.310]  Well, he meant the true terrorists.
[02:02:51.310 --> 02:02:56.772]  You know, he thought blowing up a Pan Am flight, that's chicken feed compared to what Tony Blair does on a daily basis.
[02:02:56.772 --> 02:02:58.432]  Yeah, they blow up whole countries.
[02:02:58.432 --> 02:02:59.932]  They blow up whole countries.
[02:02:59.932 --> 02:03:05.994]  That's not... Pan Am flight, that's not... that's just an initiation for these guys.
[02:03:05.994 --> 02:03:08.574]  They don't do that just to get into... Freedom lover, great questions.
[02:03:08.574 --> 02:03:09.955]  One last one for Max Keiser.
[02:03:09.955 --> 02:03:11.895]  Daryl in North Carolina.
[02:03:11.895 --> 02:03:13.376]  Yeah.
[02:03:13.376 --> 02:03:14.456]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:03:14.456 --> 02:03:14.956]  Hello, Max.
[02:03:16.246 --> 02:03:18.268]  Very quickly, I'd like to ask.
[02:03:18.268 --> 02:03:23.772]  You say that the banks can just go in and snatch out of your deposit.
[02:03:23.772 --> 02:03:27.475]  Do credit unions face the same risk?
[02:03:27.475 --> 02:03:31.499]  And do you feel that if Glass-Steagall was reinstalled, that we would recover?
[02:03:31.499 --> 02:03:32.720]  That's a good question.
[02:03:32.720 --> 02:03:33.961]  Max Keiser, take us out with that.
[02:03:37.856 --> 02:03:41.740]  If Glass-Steagall was reinstated, do you think we could recover?
[02:03:59.113 --> 02:04:06.536]  Yeah, what's happening is, Max, your Skype or phone or whatever we got you on today, it's Skype audio, is breaking up.
[02:04:06.536 --> 02:04:12.118]  But I think it's more important to point out, as you said, they're leveraging the derivatives right now.
[02:04:12.118 --> 02:04:14.899]  So that's the opposite of getting Glass-Steagall.
[02:04:14.899 --> 02:04:15.519]  In fact, they're going
[02:04:16.299 --> 02:04:19.001]  Even more than the other direction.
[02:04:19.001 --> 02:04:23.204]  They're using bailout money to further gamble and becoming more and more reckless.
[02:04:23.204 --> 02:04:26.187]  Max Keiser, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:04:26.187 --> 02:04:27.688]  How do they steal private bank accounts?
[02:04:27.688 --> 02:04:30.230]  They have the government take it over to protect them.
[02:04:30.230 --> 02:04:32.071]  Correct, Max?
[02:04:32.071 --> 02:04:33.492]  Yeah, they just make a phone call.
[02:04:33.492 --> 02:04:36.454]  There's no laws.
[02:04:36.454 --> 02:04:37.095]  Alright, Max.
[02:04:37.095 --> 02:04:37.835]  Thank you so much.
[02:04:37.835 --> 02:04:38.756]  MaxKeiser.com.
[02:04:38.756 --> 02:04:39.597]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[02:04:40.299 --> 02:04:40.759]  All right, buddy.
[02:04:40.759 --> 02:04:41.460]  Thanks.
[02:04:41.460 --> 02:04:42.560]  There goes Max.
[02:04:42.560 --> 02:04:44.161]  Great having him on for an hour and a half.
[02:04:44.161 --> 02:04:47.222]  Okay, we've got our amazing next guest coming on.
[02:04:47.222 --> 02:04:52.545]  Gunter Spenz, colonel in the East German military, has stood up against the tyranny.
[02:04:52.545 --> 02:04:53.305]  Straight ahead.
[02:04:53.305 --> 02:04:53.806]  Stay with us.
[02:05:01.240 --> 02:05:03.241]  Hey everybody, Alex Jones here.
[02:05:03.241 --> 02:05:05.982]  If you're looking for the perfect Christmas gift, listen up.
[02:05:05.982 --> 02:05:08.924]  This will make your holiday shopping very easy.
[02:05:08.924 --> 02:05:14.927]  This year, give a seed bank from one of our oldest sponsors, Solutions from Science, to your friends and family.
[02:05:14.927 --> 02:05:15.667]  Here's why.
[02:05:15.667 --> 02:05:23.851]  The Survival Seed Bank will give any friend or loved one the ability to grow a full acre crisis garden of nutritionally dense, life-sustaining food.
[02:05:23.851 --> 02:05:27.913]  And the Survival Seed Bank is not just a box of open-pollinated seeds.
[02:05:27.913 --> 02:05:30.254]  It's an indestructible, waterproof seed bank.
[02:05:30.794 --> 02:05:33.776]  That can even be buried if we face a real meltdown.
[02:05:33.776 --> 02:05:35.297]  And here's the best part.
[02:05:35.297 --> 02:05:42.842]  All the seeds in the Survival Seed Bank go through strict germination testing so you can be confident you're not buying old seeds.
[02:05:42.842 --> 02:05:47.144]  Give a Survival Seed Bank this Christmas by going to survivalseedbank.com.
[02:05:47.144 --> 02:05:49.226]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[02:05:49.226 --> 02:05:53.308]  Or you can call 877-327-0365 to give the gift that produces an ongoing supply of life-sustaining food.
[02:06:00.715 --> 02:06:08.818]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:06:08.818 --> 02:06:11.359]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:06:11.359 --> 02:06:16.740]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:06:16.740 --> 02:06:19.781]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:06:19.781 --> 02:06:21.842]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:06:22.102 --> 02:06:28.347]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:06:28.347 --> 02:06:31.730]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:06:31.730 --> 02:06:37.515]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:06:37.515 --> 02:06:39.156]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:06:39.156 --> 02:06:40.457]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:06:40.457 --> 02:06:43.140]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:06:43.140 --> 02:06:44.541]  He explains everything you need to know.
[02:06:44.801 --> 02:06:47.342]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:06:47.342 --> 02:06:51.964]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:06:51.964 --> 02:06:54.545]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[02:07:02.349 --> 02:07:06.310]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:06.310 --> 02:07:15.173]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:07:15.173 --> 02:07:19.794]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:07:19.794 --> 02:07:30.618]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:07:31.258 --> 02:07:40.760]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:40.760 --> 02:07:46.202]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:07:46.202 --> 02:07:53.683]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:53.683 --> 02:07:56.444]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:08:05.831 --> 02:08:10.675]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:08:10.675 --> 02:08:12.256]  You want answers?
[02:08:12.256 --> 02:08:14.177]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:14.177 --> 02:08:18.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:22.063]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:34.455 --> 02:08:39.322]  Well, for the rest of the hour, Guterr Spens is our guest.
[02:08:39.322 --> 02:08:48.554]  And they have the video up at the Oath Keepers website where he was interviewed and he's brought his former East German passport and his diplomas.
[02:08:49.395 --> 02:09:00.741]  Army documents, of course he showed all that to Oath Keepers, but he's involved with Oath Keepers and is a patriot because we know the history of what happened there with the fall of the Berlin Wall.
[02:09:00.741 --> 02:09:12.926]  We know that it was a key military group, military group that he was in and commanding, that actually said no on the orders to shoot the citizens that in mass were climbing over the wall.
[02:09:14.167 --> 02:09:14.307]  That's
[02:09:31.963 --> 02:09:32.784]  A military coup.
[02:09:32.784 --> 02:09:38.511]  It was just the military standing down and not shooting their citizens that they did do in the past famously.
[02:09:38.511 --> 02:09:40.053]  And I don't want to go over his entire bio.
[02:09:40.053 --> 02:09:41.435]  It's very, very lengthy.
[02:09:41.435 --> 02:09:44.759]  And it's also in a big article at Oathkeepers.org.
[02:09:44.759 --> 02:09:49.064]  But the article's headline is Oathkeepers at the fall of the Berlin Wall article.
[02:09:50.151 --> 02:09:50.852]  And it breaks it down.
[02:09:50.852 --> 02:09:54.356]  He was born in 52, got a university degree and joined the Army in 72.
[02:09:54.356 --> 02:09:57.500]  At this time, the Army had to get rid of the older officers.
[02:09:57.500 --> 02:09:58.822]  I guess they weren't playing ball.
[02:09:58.822 --> 02:10:03.288]  The new generation was very well educated and not dependent on the support of the party.
[02:10:03.288 --> 02:10:04.589]  We followed our oath.
[02:10:05.410 --> 02:10:10.714]  Uh, the revolution started the spring of 89 in the city of, how do I pronounce that?
[02:10:10.714 --> 02:10:12.315]  Leipzig, I knew I was getting it right.
[02:10:12.315 --> 02:10:14.876]  I can hardly pronounce English, much less German.
[02:10:14.876 --> 02:10:17.658]  Uh, Deutsch, in a church in downtown.
[02:10:17.658 --> 02:10:22.641]  On Monday, by 7pm, the service ended and a group of church members were just walking around, uh,
[02:10:24.454 --> 02:10:30.075]  Doing nothing, and it goes on, they just walked over the street into heavy traffic, but every car stopped to give them the way.
[02:10:30.075 --> 02:10:33.416]  People came to watch, and week by week, more and more joined them.
[02:10:33.416 --> 02:10:35.396]  The party became a big problem.
[02:10:35.396 --> 02:10:36.016]  It goes on.
[02:10:36.016 --> 02:10:41.237]  Encouraged by that, many people left East Germany via the embassies of other countries.
[02:10:41.237 --> 02:10:43.637]  And then he breaks down what happened after that.
[02:10:43.637 --> 02:10:50.178]  He was served at the headquarters of the 3rd Army in that city, at Leipzig, at the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.
[02:10:50.178 --> 02:10:52.559]  The Stasi, a secret police, and the party arrested
[02:10:54.179 --> 02:10:59.062]  ...him in the summer of 89, but my commander gave them five days to provide any evidence.
[02:10:59.062 --> 02:11:01.384]  They could not, and I came back into service.
[02:11:01.384 --> 02:11:06.768]  I wish that LTC Terry Lackin had such a commander.
[02:11:06.768 --> 02:11:09.189]  And then it goes into what happened to other folks.
[02:11:09.189 --> 02:11:22.798]  You know, I meant to get this photo, but then I couldn't find it last night because I've moved several times, but my mother went to Germany and brought back a famous photo of the East German soldier helping the toddler through to its parents.
[02:11:22.798 --> 02:11:23.519]  Have you seen that photo?
[02:11:23.979 --> 02:11:24.801]  Yes, I've seen it.
[02:11:24.801 --> 02:11:25.523]  Do you remember the name of it?
[02:11:25.523 --> 02:11:26.966]  Because we won't be able to pull it up if you can remember it.
[02:11:28.817 --> 02:11:32.458]  Okay, well, basically, I've only gone into part of this.
[02:11:32.458 --> 02:11:44.621]  You guys stood down, and then that led, finally, to the falling of the Berlin Wall, so it shows that one man on the right can stand up against an army of people who are in the wrong, to paraphrase the founder of the Texas Rangers.
[02:11:44.621 --> 02:11:48.643]  So, Gunter Spins, it's good to have you here today.
[02:11:48.643 --> 02:11:56.745]  Break down your story, what you witnessed in Germany, in East Germany, and then the parallels that you see happening in the world today, if any.
[02:11:58.612 --> 02:12:01.196]  Yes, thank you for having me.
[02:12:01.196 --> 02:12:02.939]  So I'm Gunther Spenz.
[02:12:02.939 --> 02:12:04.401]  I serve the East German Army.
[02:12:04.401 --> 02:12:06.985]  I left the army in 1989 as lieutenant colonel.
[02:12:06.985 --> 02:12:07.526]  This is a document.
[02:12:07.526 --> 02:12:08.227]  This is the ID.
[02:12:14.355 --> 02:12:17.736]  Every officer, every soldier has such a document.
[02:12:17.736 --> 02:12:19.556]  There's still my picture in it, of course.
[02:12:19.556 --> 02:12:22.756]  Yeah, they're going to aim the camera in a moment.
[02:12:22.756 --> 02:12:35.039]  And, of course, the rank, Lieutenant Colonel, and also the base I served, which was Leipzig, and there's the number.
[02:12:35.039 --> 02:12:35.979]  Yes, sir, can we see the photo?
[02:12:35.979 --> 02:12:36.979]  It's just really interesting.
[02:12:36.979 --> 02:12:37.499]  Here you go.
[02:12:37.499 --> 02:12:38.479]  Thank you.
[02:12:38.479 --> 02:12:39.439]  Yeah, there's one.
[02:12:39.439 --> 02:12:40.680]  Go ahead.
[02:12:40.680 --> 02:12:41.940]  Thank you.
[02:12:41.940 --> 02:12:42.560]  Please continue.
[02:12:44.059 --> 02:12:57.505]  So, I served first in the 4th Infantry Division and since 1976 in the command of the headquarters of the 3rd Army.
[02:12:57.505 --> 02:13:09.971]  And I became Lieutenant Colonel and we were in Leipzig and the revolution started in Leipzig, in the city of Leipzig.
[02:13:09.971 --> 02:13:13.093]  It started really with a few men
[02:13:13.979 --> 02:13:18.967]  From the church, we'd left the church by 7pm in the city in downtown of Leipzig.
[02:13:19.864 --> 02:13:25.808]  And there is like a ring, a street, around the downtown.
[02:13:25.808 --> 02:13:32.452]  And he just walked in the middle of the traffic, in the middle of the street, around the downtown.
[02:13:32.452 --> 02:13:35.834]  No sign, nothing.
[02:13:35.834 --> 02:13:38.436]  Just he was there, quiet, peaceful.
[02:13:38.436 --> 02:13:41.517]  So it was that silent protest that triggered it?
[02:13:41.517 --> 02:13:43.018]  Yes, that triggered it.
[02:13:43.018 --> 02:13:47.321]  I mean, the situation for the DDR, for East Germany, was not good at this time.
[02:13:47.321 --> 02:13:48.142]  A lot left.
[02:13:49.022 --> 02:13:54.944]  East Germany via the Ambassador in Hungary, in Czechia.
[02:13:54.944 --> 02:14:00.085]  And the border itself was very well, let's say, protected.
[02:14:00.085 --> 02:14:02.666]  It was not possible to cross the border.
[02:14:02.666 --> 02:14:04.286]  Unless you will die.
[02:14:04.286 --> 02:14:07.687]  But via the Ambassador, you could go.
[02:14:07.687 --> 02:14:09.268]  It was easier.
[02:14:09.268 --> 02:14:12.949]  And the pressure was that high, they had to find a solution.
[02:14:12.949 --> 02:14:13.809]  But there was no solution.
[02:14:15.006 --> 02:14:16.447]  This is hard to say.
[02:14:16.447 --> 02:14:20.369]  Because there was no public, there was no free press, no free media.
[02:14:20.369 --> 02:14:21.770]  Definitely, I would say on the thousands.
[02:14:43.809 --> 02:14:55.620]  Especially in the beginning, when the border was consolidated, it was not possible, in my opinion, to cross the border and be alive.
[02:14:55.620 --> 02:15:00.744]  There was, in the way before, when you go close to the border,
[02:15:02.930 --> 02:15:05.872]  Kilometer about 17 miles.
[02:15:05.872 --> 02:15:07.813]  It was completely blocked.
[02:15:07.813 --> 02:15:10.735]  You had a special document when you were living there.
[02:15:10.735 --> 02:15:12.456]  All others would be arrested.
[02:15:12.456 --> 02:15:14.697]  You could not even get close to the border.
[02:15:14.697 --> 02:15:17.979]  So living near the border you had to have a special document?
[02:15:17.979 --> 02:15:19.240]  A special document.
[02:15:19.240 --> 02:15:21.721]  Then you could go in this area.
[02:15:21.721 --> 02:15:28.806]  The border itself was, there was at least two fences with about 100 yards between it.
[02:15:30.043 --> 02:15:33.345]  Full light, all day, all night.
[02:15:33.345 --> 02:15:38.367]  And we had the towers, and the soldier there, and you shoot.
[02:15:38.367 --> 02:15:39.288]  For sure.
[02:15:39.288 --> 02:15:42.409]  It was the order to shoot everyone on the border.
[02:15:42.409 --> 02:15:43.170]  Wow.
[02:15:43.170 --> 02:15:53.755]  We talked about that famous photo of the German soldier with the toddler that's been caught in a bar bar, and he helps it through, and then we're told that that soldier disappeared.
[02:15:53.755 --> 02:15:54.736]  Yes.
[02:15:54.736 --> 02:15:58.458]  And the border was closed in August.
[02:15:59.517 --> 02:16:00.877]  13th of August 1961.
[02:16:00.877 --> 02:16:04.719]  Since then was the border completely closed.
[02:16:04.719 --> 02:16:12.161]  It started with the Berlin Wall, and also the border along to West Germany was completely closed.
[02:16:12.161 --> 02:16:18.123]  Even if it was not possible to go to the Baltic Sea, in the North, no way.
[02:16:18.123 --> 02:16:26.005]  In the beginning, a lot died, of course, because they expected they can do this, can go, there's no way.
[02:16:27.324 --> 02:16:35.226]  Even when you leave East Germany to the East, for Bulgaria, Poland, all this, there was always control.
[02:16:35.226 --> 02:16:43.589]  I was several times in the Black Sea vacation and then I crossed the border to the Czech, from the Czech to Hungary.
[02:16:43.589 --> 02:16:50.031]  Everyone called back to my base and told he left the border there.
[02:16:50.031 --> 02:16:53.172]  Before I got the authorization to go and was
[02:16:54.249 --> 02:16:55.330]  Our country is in the East.
[02:16:55.330 --> 02:17:05.536]  When I got the authorization, I had to declare what point I will cross the border, when, what time, and the same the way back.
[02:17:05.536 --> 02:17:07.878]  Even this was exactly controlled.
[02:17:07.878 --> 02:17:19.546]  Now continuing, because I want to get into the fall of the Berlin Wall and how you were intimately involved in that with the first major military group to stand down and how that took place and how you discussed it beforehand.
[02:17:20.206 --> 02:17:33.017]  And then I want to get into parallels with what's happening today, as I mentioned earlier, but what was it like talking to the military, you know, once you got into the army, about when they did have to shoot citizens, and did you ever witness any of that?
[02:17:33.017 --> 02:17:34.799]  There was two parts.
[02:17:34.799 --> 02:17:40.604]  Actually, East Germany had the authorization to have 110,000 soldiers, no more.
[02:17:40.604 --> 02:17:45.408]  If there were more, so they divided the, we would say here, border patrol,
[02:17:46.530 --> 02:17:48.290]  These troops from the normal army.
[02:17:48.290 --> 02:17:49.911]  So they were separated.
[02:17:49.911 --> 02:17:51.511]  It was the same.
[02:17:51.511 --> 02:17:53.852]  The same minister, the same department.
[02:17:53.852 --> 02:17:55.032]  So that was my next question.
[02:17:55.032 --> 02:18:03.675]  What type of men in the special units that would shoot their own German citizens, East German citizens, what type of people were they?
[02:18:03.675 --> 02:18:07.836]  They served, normally, they had to serve 18 months in the army.
[02:18:07.836 --> 02:18:13.377]  Everyone, unless you are sick or have a reason not to do so.
[02:18:13.377 --> 02:18:15.518]  And they selected people for the army.
[02:18:16.653 --> 02:18:22.696]  For the Air Force and also for, let's say, Border Patrol, this part.
[02:18:22.696 --> 02:18:24.037]  He was young, 18, 19, 20.
[02:18:24.037 --> 02:18:28.179]  He had to serve 18 years.
[02:18:28.179 --> 02:18:35.643]  When someone should, he was replaced and had a different service to do.
[02:18:35.643 --> 02:18:39.045]  He was away from his friends, from his unit.
[02:18:39.045 --> 02:18:40.106]  He would not stay in the unit.
[02:18:41.198 --> 02:18:46.443]  Oh, because I guess they knew that after you'd killed another citizen, a lot of times you had bad feelings about it.
[02:18:46.443 --> 02:18:50.907]  Bad feelings about it, you would talk about it, and no one should talk about it.
[02:18:50.907 --> 02:18:52.708]  So, um, he moved them away.
[02:18:52.708 --> 02:19:00.335]  I have no idea what... Yeah, now they're giving the troops amnesiacs after they tell them, kill a whole village, they give them an amnesiac.
[02:19:00.335 --> 02:19:03.938]  That's even come out in Wire Magazine, so no one remembers.
[02:19:03.938 --> 02:19:04.939]  That's pretty, pretty evil.
[02:19:06.132 --> 02:19:12.494]  In the last years, when I was active in the service, no one would try to cross the border.
[02:19:12.494 --> 02:19:15.195]  Because everyone knows there is no way.
[02:19:15.195 --> 02:19:16.315]  But then, they would shoot.
[02:19:16.315 --> 02:19:19.916]  This is for sure.
[02:19:19.916 --> 02:19:21.197]  What about that famous photo?
[02:19:21.197 --> 02:19:25.138]  Because, I mean, how could you shoot women and children?
[02:19:25.138 --> 02:19:27.359]  I guess they just followed orders and did it?
[02:19:27.359 --> 02:19:27.499]  Yes.
[02:19:28.530 --> 02:19:30.111]  Just call it a vote and take it.
[02:19:43.584 --> 02:19:46.326]  Mr. Romania is very interesting.
[02:19:46.326 --> 02:19:48.428]  Let's talk about Romania straight ahead.
[02:19:48.428 --> 02:19:50.189]  Gunter Spins is our guest.
[02:19:50.189 --> 02:19:51.610]  We're going to be right back with him.
[02:19:51.610 --> 02:19:53.392]  Because this is what America is facing.
[02:19:53.392 --> 02:19:54.573]  Make no mistake.
[02:19:54.573 --> 02:19:55.373]  And I would submit it.
[02:19:55.373 --> 02:19:59.657]  They are training the military to wage war against the population and confiscate guns.
[02:20:01.753 --> 02:20:03.334]  Solar power.
[02:20:03.334 --> 02:20:05.455]  Hand crank power.
[02:20:05.455 --> 02:20:07.616]  Radio power.

[02:21:13.754 --> 02:21:21.280]  Fake TV is a small electronic device that makes the same light as a real television, so from outside it looks like someone is home watching TV.
[02:21:21.280 --> 02:21:25.683]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing to burglars.
[02:21:25.683 --> 02:21:32.408]  Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm, comes with AC adapter, and is highly recommended by numerous police departments.

[02:22:40.795 --> 02:22:50.662]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[02:22:50.662 --> 02:22:52.163]  The war is here.
[02:22:52.163 --> 02:22:53.464]  It's an info war.
[02:22:54.104 --> 02:23:00.868]  The Spirit of 1776 versus the Mindset of 1984.

[02:24:24.131 --> 02:24:26.312]  Don Turner Spins is our guest.
[02:24:26.312 --> 02:24:28.333]  He's going to be on InfoWars Nightly News tonight.
[02:24:28.333 --> 02:24:33.797]  I'm going to do a long interview with him and then we're going to air it at the end of the live news Thursday evening.
[02:24:34.737 --> 02:24:37.538]  We have the news and also extended interviews like we did last night.
[02:24:37.538 --> 02:24:40.320]  We aired part two of the Pharmacist Ben Fuchs interview.
[02:24:40.320 --> 02:24:49.824]  We're going to have some breaking Oathkeeper news with Wayne Madsen that is major league big dealing with
[02:24:50.684 --> 02:24:52.686]  The situation with Fast and Furious.
[02:24:52.686 --> 02:25:05.916]  Now, getting back to Oath Keepers, this is a short segment, but you were saying it'd be good to start now just on how the stand-down began and how proud of you are of the town that you were in and the command center that you were in.
[02:25:05.916 --> 02:25:09.699]  What you guys said beforehand and then what unfolded.
[02:25:09.699 --> 02:25:11.980]  Yeah, so how the beginning of the Berlin Wall began.
[02:25:11.980 --> 02:25:12.321]  You were there.
[02:25:13.137 --> 02:25:17.139]  Yes, it started in the spring, early spring in 1989.
[02:25:17.139 --> 02:25:26.682]  East Germany existed this time 40 years and economically everything was going down.
[02:25:26.682 --> 02:25:37.527]  And a group of people after the church in downtown Leipzig went out of the church after the service and just walked around the downtown in Leipzig.
[02:25:39.167 --> 02:25:44.112]  Next Monday, the same, but more people came just to watch.
[02:25:44.112 --> 02:25:55.765]  I mean, also Staatssicherheit was there and controlled it, but they didn't expect this will continue, and they had nothing in their hands to arrest them or something like this.
[02:25:55.765 --> 02:25:56.145]  He just
[02:25:57.358 --> 02:26:00.340]  So this will stop and will go away.
[02:26:00.340 --> 02:26:03.682]  But what's not going away is from more and more.
[02:26:03.682 --> 02:26:21.053]  And in the army, the service of regulation, the regulation of service, says clearly you have not to obey, it was written in the documents, you have not to obey an order against their own people or against international law.
[02:26:22.093 --> 02:26:23.374]  That was written.
[02:26:23.374 --> 02:26:27.918]  So, the body, I mean, the documents were okay in East Germany.
[02:26:27.918 --> 02:26:31.400]  But the problem was, the body didn't follow any order.
[02:26:31.400 --> 02:26:33.462]  We see this here too.
[02:26:33.462 --> 02:26:37.605]  Law is law, but you can ignore it.
[02:26:37.605 --> 02:26:39.607]  You enforce law you like.
[02:26:39.607 --> 02:26:43.570]  As we see here now, the border is actually closed.
[02:26:43.570 --> 02:26:48.254]  When someone comes illegal from Mexico to the United States, it's against the law.
[02:26:48.254 --> 02:26:49.635]  It's a crime.
[02:26:49.635 --> 02:26:50.456]  But it's not enforced.
[02:26:51.607 --> 02:26:53.730]  And same was in East Germany.
[02:26:53.730 --> 02:26:56.354]  Much more grass, because the party were always right.
[02:26:57.734 --> 02:27:05.536]  And therefore they had cameras there, recorded everything, just to collect information and try to find a way to stop this.
[02:27:05.536 --> 02:27:16.218]  But it was not stopped because there were more and more and every Monday people came from other cities, close to Leipzig, every Monday in the city to see and join more.
[02:27:16.218 --> 02:27:22.160]  And later also other officers from our headquarter joined, not in uniform, but I know this man.
[02:27:23.809 --> 02:27:31.795]  And then in October, the 7th of October, was the 40th anniversary of the Republic, East Germany.
[02:27:31.795 --> 02:27:34.237]  And the Monday before, it was 75,000.
[02:27:34.237 --> 02:27:41.243]  And when you see the numbers, Leipzig had a population of about, at this time, 500,000.
[02:27:41.243 --> 02:27:45.246]  And 75,000 were on the street, from everywhere.
[02:27:45.246 --> 02:27:49.029]  They had a long way sometimes, not just from the city.
[02:27:49.029 --> 02:27:52.672]  And, you know, the next Monday will be much more.
[02:27:53.908 --> 02:28:15.264]  So they tried to stop this the Monday before there was paramilitary units from all the companies they had to have the trained paramilitary units and they put them on the street with Kalashnikov, AK-47, but no ammunition.
[02:28:15.264 --> 02:28:22.149]  And they did not use the Stasi against because they would have a revolution right now.
[02:28:23.629 --> 02:28:27.013]  So, he knew exactly that next Monday will be more.
[02:28:27.013 --> 02:28:31.538]  Next Monday, there are 150,000 on the street.
[02:28:31.538 --> 02:28:40.569]  This means 1% of the whole population of East Germany were on this Monday in the city of Leipzig in the rally.
[02:28:40.569 --> 02:28:41.270]  This is a lot.
[02:28:43.024 --> 02:28:46.345]  And this was finally the fall, there was no way.
[02:28:46.345 --> 02:28:50.967]  There would be next Monday maybe half the population on the street.
[02:28:50.967 --> 02:28:53.988]  So it was over, they had to find a solution.
[02:28:53.988 --> 02:28:58.589]  And on this Monday we had a meeting in the headquarters of the army.
[02:28:58.589 --> 02:29:03.131]  We had a meeting and afternoon
[02:29:04.252 --> 02:29:07.334]  And the commander of the Russians were also there.
[02:29:07.334 --> 02:29:11.577]  And our commander was Lieutenant General Bauer.
[02:29:11.577 --> 02:29:16.340]  He said clearly, no soldier will leave the base.
[02:29:16.340 --> 02:29:21.124]  There were already soldiers, paratroops, in Leipzig.
[02:29:21.124 --> 02:29:26.527]  Young guys, 18, 19, 20 years, and they were trained to use them on the street.
[02:29:26.527 --> 02:29:28.269]  But no one had to leave the base.
[02:29:28.988 --> 02:29:29.709]  All right, stay there.
[02:29:29.709 --> 02:29:31.750]  This is an amazing point to stop.
[02:29:31.750 --> 02:29:43.780]  And you were a lieutenant colonel there who was part of this, the stand-down that on record, in the history books, led to the fall of the Berlin Wall by people simply not acting like animals, acting like human beings.
[02:29:43.780 --> 02:29:47.424]  And then we'll talk about what the Stasi did once the fall happened, running and hiding.
[02:29:47.424 --> 02:29:50.486]  And then we'll look at parallels to what's happening here today.
[02:29:50.486 --> 02:29:51.867]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.867 --> 02:29:54.389]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.389 --> 02:29:57.072]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.378 --> 02:30:06.402]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:30:06.402 --> 02:30:09.646]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:30:09.646 --> 02:30:14.451]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:30:14.451 --> 02:30:20.838]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:30:20.838 --> 02:30:23.081]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:30:23.601 --> 02:30:23.901]  Tim Geithner?
[02:30:23.901 --> 02:30:24.161]  Bernanke?
[02:30:24.161 --> 02:30:24.782]  They're arsonists!
[02:30:24.782 --> 02:30:25.542]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:30:25.542 --> 02:30:27.223]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:30:42.509 --> 02:30:49.794]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.

[02:32:00.817 --> 02:32:01.978]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:32:01.978 --> 02:32:08.922]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:32:08.922 --> 02:32:11.484]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:32:11.484 --> 02:32:16.847]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:32:16.847 --> 02:32:19.889]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:32:19.889 --> 02:32:21.950]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:32:22.210 --> 02:32:28.454]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:32:28.454 --> 02:32:31.836]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:32:31.836 --> 02:32:37.620]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:32:37.620 --> 02:32:39.261]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:32:39.261 --> 02:32:40.562]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:32:40.562 --> 02:32:43.224]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:32:43.224 --> 02:32:47.466]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.

[02:32:52.069 --> 02:32:53.190]  That's End of America.

[02:33:13.980 --> 02:33:16.781]  Mainstream Media.
[02:33:16.781 --> 02:33:17.862]  Government Cover-Ups.
[02:33:19.341 --> 02:33:21.243]  You want answers?
[02:33:21.243 --> 02:33:23.185]  Well, so does he.
[02:33:23.185 --> 02:33:29.470]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:31.098 --> 02:33:34.581]  Classical tyranny is being set up in this country.
[02:33:34.581 --> 02:33:39.344]  And Gunther Spenz was a lieutenant colonel in the East German Army.
[02:33:39.344 --> 02:33:43.387]  He was there at the epicenter of the stand down against tyranny.
[02:33:43.387 --> 02:33:44.768]  And look at the headlines today.
[02:33:44.768 --> 02:33:49.071]  Sheriff's Department sponsored secret meeting on small government terrorist.
[02:33:49.671 --> 02:33:51.031]  Run by the ADL.
[02:33:51.031 --> 02:33:56.293]  And it says people that don't want big government or want their rights are terrorists.
[02:33:56.293 --> 02:33:56.913]  Here's another one.
[02:33:56.913 --> 02:33:57.853]  Daily Mail.
[02:33:57.853 --> 02:34:06.076]  Meet the North Dakota family of anti-government separatists busted by cops using a Predator drone after, quote, stealing six cows that kept coming on their property.
[02:34:07.049 --> 02:34:11.550]  3,000 acre ranch, they call living on a farm, the government calls it a compound.
[02:34:11.550 --> 02:34:18.112]  Even living on a farm, I'm telling you, the entire architecture of this is pointed at the American people.
[02:34:18.112 --> 02:34:20.693]  I've been to the urban warfare drills, you've seen my films.
[02:34:20.693 --> 02:34:22.094]  The Takeover, Police Day 2000, all of them.
[02:34:24.107 --> 02:34:25.308]  You've seen it.
[02:34:25.308 --> 02:34:28.430]  Where the military trains to take on the American people.
[02:34:28.430 --> 02:34:30.232]  And people are like, oh, this couldn't be real.
[02:34:30.232 --> 02:34:31.693]  Now it's being admitted.
[02:34:31.693 --> 02:34:34.174]  Ron Paul is fighting, and he said it is martial law.
[02:34:34.174 --> 02:34:36.696]  The NDAA is martial law.
[02:34:36.696 --> 02:34:39.078]  The House is set to pass it tomorrow.
[02:34:39.078 --> 02:34:40.079]  Okay?
[02:34:40.079 --> 02:34:50.787]  And Obama, who said that he didn't want to sign it because he already has those powers, turns out he pressured Congress to actually add the part for American citizens in the end of Posse Comitatus and kill anybody in the world anytime they want.
[02:34:51.710 --> 02:34:56.152]  I mean, this is, this is, the Stasi never tried something like this.
[02:34:56.152 --> 02:34:57.732]  The Russians didn't behave like this.
[02:34:57.732 --> 02:35:02.234]  I mean, Hitler didn't put stuff like this down on paper.
[02:35:02.234 --> 02:35:04.235]  Mao didn't put stuff like this down on paper.
[02:35:04.235 --> 02:35:09.857]  You know, as you were saying, Gunther, that even in East Germany you had all these rights on paper.
[02:35:09.857 --> 02:35:13.138]  The UN has all these rights on paper, to get to Article 30.
[02:35:13.138 --> 02:35:14.639]  We have all these rights on paper.
[02:35:14.639 --> 02:35:18.280]  America's the first country to actually be getting rid of them on paper.
[02:35:18.740 --> 02:35:20.962]  This is unprecedented!
[02:35:20.962 --> 02:35:25.025]  Atlanta, the free home of the brave, would now become this light of evil worldwide.
[02:35:25.025 --> 02:35:28.728]  So, let's get back to the stand-down and what progressed.
[02:35:28.728 --> 02:35:30.650]  You said the commander of the base.
[02:35:30.650 --> 02:35:45.001]  If you remember, tell us his name and everything that transpired, what it was like, what you were talking about, and then what unfolded, then what the Stasi did, and the changes that took place, and then we'll get into what America's turned into from the parallels you may see.
[02:35:45.001 --> 02:35:46.462]  First, as I mentioned,
[02:35:47.546 --> 02:35:55.897]  An army and soldier officer did not obey any order against their own people, against the national law.
[02:35:55.897 --> 02:36:02.625]  I'm an outkeeper here, and when you read the 10 orders we did not obey, we are called terrorists.
[02:36:04.497 --> 02:36:06.558]  He was not a terrorist in East Germany.
[02:36:06.558 --> 02:36:17.866]  In East Germany, when someone had a different meaning or tried to walk against the party, he was not a patriot, he wasn't a terrorist, he was against the Republic.
[02:36:19.269 --> 02:36:20.690]  The enemy of the republic?
[02:36:20.690 --> 02:36:23.292]  Yes, the enemy of the state, the enemy of the republic.
[02:36:23.292 --> 02:36:24.693]  It is actually the same.
[02:36:24.693 --> 02:36:26.054]  And the same happens here.
[02:36:26.054 --> 02:36:34.720]  When you say you stand for the constitution, you support the constitution, you took the oath, you defend the constitution, then you're close to a terrorist.
[02:36:34.720 --> 02:36:35.881]  Something is not right.
[02:36:35.881 --> 02:36:43.806]  Listen, I have police squad car video in my film Road to Tyranny where they pull a woman over at a checkpoint and they find a pocket constitution and they get scared.
[02:36:43.806 --> 02:36:44.887]  They swore an oath to it.
[02:36:44.887 --> 02:36:45.487]  It's like a joke.
[02:36:47.445 --> 02:36:53.270]  I mean, even with the East German police and military, you guys weren't scared of the Constitution, were you?
[02:36:53.270 --> 02:36:55.552]  Somebody pulled it out, did you think it was a snake?
[02:36:55.552 --> 02:37:01.657]  It was completely different in East Germany because we got to teach the Constitution in the school.
[02:37:01.657 --> 02:37:04.079]  I learned it in the school.
[02:37:04.079 --> 02:37:12.025]  And then later, before you took the oath in the army, we had lessons about the Constitution, what we have to do.
[02:37:12.025 --> 02:37:16.569]  And then we took the oath of the Constitution and became soldier, or I guess officer.
[02:37:18.066 --> 02:37:21.628]  The Constitution, everyone knows it, because it was teached in the school.
[02:37:21.628 --> 02:37:23.368]  Everyone knows the history.
[02:37:23.368 --> 02:37:29.111]  Of course, a little bit different, because it's the big question, who tells you the history, no?
[02:37:29.111 --> 02:37:29.571]  Exactly.
[02:37:29.571 --> 02:37:33.373]  Now, I want to get back to the parallels with modern day, but let's continue.
[02:37:33.373 --> 02:37:35.534]  So you're there in the town where it all begins.
[02:37:35.534 --> 02:37:36.715]  Your commanding officer says...
[02:37:37.515 --> 02:37:40.438]  You're ordered to go out on the streets and suppress people, don't do it.
[02:37:40.438 --> 02:37:49.806]  Yes, they started, the party started different ways to bring this, this rallies down, but there were more and more people and there was no way to bring them down.
[02:37:49.806 --> 02:37:52.428]  And they could not start, the Stasi could do nothing.
[02:37:52.428 --> 02:37:57.052]  When the Stasi would be on the street and try to arrest people, there would be a civil war.
[02:37:58.294 --> 02:37:59.955]  Everyone hates the Stasi.
[02:37:59.955 --> 02:38:01.516]  They could not do anything.
[02:38:01.516 --> 02:38:03.317]  Not in public.
[02:38:03.317 --> 02:38:07.020]  And they tried to bring the army in.
[02:38:07.020 --> 02:38:18.888]  First the paramilitary troops, without ammunition, but with AK-47s, just standing there along the street, doing nothing, just to make a statement, give a statement.
[02:38:18.888 --> 02:38:23.191]  And then they brought from close to Berlin the base of the paratroops.
[02:38:24.121 --> 02:38:24.461]  I think so.
[02:38:41.479 --> 02:38:48.061]  We're going to use the power troops, the soldiers, against the people to bring them from the street, yeah?
[02:38:48.061 --> 02:38:57.143]  And the last day was the 7th of October, 150,000 on the street, which is immense for the city Leipzig.
[02:38:57.143 --> 02:39:07.126]  And we had in the afternoon a meeting, all officers of the headquarter of the army and our commander, that clearly no soldier will leave the base.
[02:39:08.393 --> 02:39:08.593]  Really?
[02:39:08.593 --> 02:39:13.536]  And so when the authoritarian state's enforcers didn't enforce, the tyranny fell.
[02:39:13.536 --> 02:39:14.616]  But please continue.
[02:39:14.616 --> 02:39:16.877]  So what happened once the military stood down?
[02:39:38.700 --> 02:39:46.385]  Well, the rally was peaceful, huge rally, and the body knows this is just the beginning.
[02:39:47.403 --> 02:39:49.403]  The week before, 75,000.
[02:39:49.403 --> 02:39:53.444]  Next Monday, twice the size, 150,000.
[02:39:53.444 --> 02:39:57.005]  Which is 1% of the whole population of East Germany.
[02:39:57.005 --> 02:40:00.226]  There was no way out of the situation.
[02:40:00.226 --> 02:40:03.306]  And what the party did is that we have to do something.
[02:40:03.306 --> 02:40:04.847]  And the problem was the border.
[02:40:04.847 --> 02:40:06.527]  People want to leave here.
[02:40:06.527 --> 02:40:08.067]  Leave East Germany.
[02:40:08.067 --> 02:40:09.408]  And the border was closed.
[02:40:09.408 --> 02:40:10.968]  And this was a question of the time.
[02:40:10.968 --> 02:40:13.788]  It would be like a civil war.
[02:40:13.788 --> 02:40:16.409]  And normally the party works like this.
[02:40:17.961 --> 02:40:20.562]  They will not give you an order in the party.
[02:40:20.562 --> 02:40:28.707]  They will tell you what they want and you and they expect you will do the best you can to fulfill this order.
[02:40:28.707 --> 02:40:32.669]  So in the party you would never say you have to say this, you have to do this.
[02:40:32.669 --> 02:40:41.333]  No, you will say it's necessary and you can do this and give you the order but you have to do it and decide it by your own.
[02:40:41.333 --> 02:40:42.894]  So fulfill the order of the party.
[02:40:42.894 --> 02:40:46.196]  This is all the education of the party about this way.
[02:40:47.947 --> 02:40:50.830]  So, and what happens is the following.
[02:40:50.830 --> 02:40:56.235]  We need a document, we need a solution for this situation on the border.
[02:40:56.235 --> 02:41:09.648]  A colonel from the Border Patrol got the order to provide a document, build a group and provide some documents for the party with a solution for this situation.
[02:41:12.335 --> 02:41:18.642]  I heard him later, when he explained what, he said, I have no idea what I can do.
[02:41:18.642 --> 02:41:20.785]  There is no solution.
[02:41:20.785 --> 02:41:23.668]  The only solution is open the border.
[02:41:23.668 --> 02:41:26.211]  And he wrote a document.
[02:41:26.211 --> 02:41:29.274]  Everyone has the right to leave and cross the border.
[02:41:30.290 --> 02:41:32.711]  And the party did not even read this.
[02:41:32.711 --> 02:41:34.691]  Because it never happens before.
[02:41:34.691 --> 02:41:44.434]  He was a colonel, was a member of the party, he got the order and they expect he will do the best he can for the party to fix this problem.
[02:41:44.434 --> 02:41:46.915]  And he had no idea, so he wrote, everyone can leave.
[02:41:47.984 --> 02:42:07.229]  And the secretary of the party in Berlin was... there was also a demonstration in a rally in Berlin now, Berlin and in Dresden, and the people would have an answer, and he should provide an answer, a solution for this problem, and he got this document, and he just, he was happy, no one checked it from the party.
[02:42:07.229 --> 02:42:12.210]  Everyone was sure this would be the right way, because it wasn't the party.
[02:42:12.210 --> 02:42:14.671]  And he read it, and he stopped.
[02:42:15.771 --> 02:42:23.396]  Then he continued, everyone can leave with a passport, the East German Democratic Republic.
[02:42:25.299 --> 02:42:26.300]  No one expected this.
[02:42:26.300 --> 02:42:30.603]  So basically, because the general was told to figure out a way to fix it, he said, okay, let him go.
[02:42:30.603 --> 02:42:32.524]  And so it was a chain reaction.
[02:42:32.524 --> 02:42:35.646]  Well, a high-level party person said this, and it must be okay.
[02:42:35.646 --> 02:42:37.867]  And that shows that command and control system.
[02:42:37.867 --> 02:42:40.729]  Now, what did the Stasi start to do after the wall fell?
[02:42:40.729 --> 02:42:45.132]  You know, the people that love torturing, the people that love controlling people, love spying.
[02:42:45.132 --> 02:42:47.173]  It started far before.
[02:42:47.173 --> 02:42:49.455]  They knew exactly they had good information.
[02:42:50.299 --> 02:42:53.622]  They know there will be an end.
[02:42:53.622 --> 02:42:57.905]  The economy was going down, the rallies, more and more people.
[02:42:57.905 --> 02:43:00.988]  And what they did, the Stasi was also in the army.
[02:43:00.988 --> 02:43:03.070]  It was called Department 2000.
[02:43:03.070 --> 02:43:09.555]  The Stasi had every six months, they had to write a document about me.
[02:43:09.555 --> 02:43:13.559]  I can continue the position I have or not.
[02:43:14.582 --> 02:43:16.463]  They have to check it, you know.
[02:43:16.463 --> 02:43:20.525]  If they see some risk for the party, they would be moved away.
[02:43:20.525 --> 02:43:22.746]  By the way, you were arrested once by the Stasi.
[02:43:22.746 --> 02:43:24.087]  I was arrested by the Stasi.
[02:43:24.087 --> 02:43:24.828]  What did they do?
[02:43:24.828 --> 02:43:25.628]  Keep you up and stuff?
[02:43:25.628 --> 02:43:26.769]  What did they do to you?
[02:43:26.769 --> 02:43:27.749]  Were you an army officer?
[02:43:27.749 --> 02:43:30.631]  Was it a little bit better?
[02:43:30.631 --> 02:43:33.012]  What they tried is to find something, you know.
[02:43:33.635 --> 02:43:40.939]  some evidence which would be against our regulation of service or against the body.
[02:43:40.939 --> 02:43:47.683]  This is pretty easy because as an officer you have actually no rights.
[02:43:47.683 --> 02:43:57.909]  In East Germany you have rights, of course, but when you do anything, even when you look TV from West Germany, this would be a reason to lock you up.
[02:43:57.909 --> 02:43:58.549]  It was forbidden.
[02:43:59.821 --> 02:44:00.381]  It's crazy.
[02:44:00.381 --> 02:44:01.001]  Verboten?
[02:44:01.001 --> 02:44:03.422]  Verboten.
[02:44:03.422 --> 02:44:04.062]  Wow.
[02:44:04.062 --> 02:44:07.083]  So what did they do to you while you were in there?
[02:44:07.083 --> 02:44:11.004]  First they tried to find some evidence.
[02:44:11.004 --> 02:44:21.186]  I left the base for just some service and I got a hint I should stop at my home and have a look at my home and I did this on the way.
[02:44:22.578 --> 02:44:30.461]  And Di Stasi was in my apartment and searching for anything or trying to put something in.
[02:44:30.461 --> 02:44:32.341]  No idea what.
[02:44:32.341 --> 02:44:33.682]  I called the police.
[02:44:33.682 --> 02:44:34.722]  Di Stasi got arrested.
[02:44:34.722 --> 02:44:36.443]  This was fun.
[02:44:36.443 --> 02:44:36.763]  Oh really?
[02:44:36.763 --> 02:44:39.584]  Of course he let them go, yeah.
[02:44:39.584 --> 02:44:42.685]  So the same type of stuff we see here where you call the sheriff on the feds.
[02:44:42.685 --> 02:44:43.165]  Yes.
[02:44:43.165 --> 02:44:47.807]  And of course you had warrantless wiretapping, all the same things that we now see happening here.
[02:44:49.127 --> 02:44:51.588]  How did you get to the United States?
[02:44:51.588 --> 02:44:52.709]  Obviously back then the U.S.
[02:44:52.709 --> 02:44:55.070]  criticized the type of things going on in East Germany.
[02:44:55.070 --> 02:44:56.911]  Now they say it's like mother's milk.
[02:44:56.911 --> 02:44:59.012]  Tyranny is good, freedom is bad.
[02:44:59.012 --> 02:45:06.676]  It's kind of flipped and in some cases it's going more extreme, you know, where they have Air Force aircraft scanning the evil citizens now.
[02:45:06.676 --> 02:45:12.739]  The whole system being used against us, a conscious move towards authoritarianism, the branding of it, all of it.
[02:45:12.739 --> 02:45:13.680]  What are the parallels?
[02:45:15.083 --> 02:45:23.148]  uh... that you see uh... with uh... what you witness growing up in East Germany a famous authoritarian state versus the U.S.
[02:45:23.148 --> 02:45:25.409]  and the direction we're going.
[02:45:25.409 --> 02:45:42.018]  When you see the First Amendment I mean I have a certain officer it was in a gun show I had my t-shirt on and the officer saw me police officer he was there in the service to check around and he went away
[02:45:44.235 --> 02:45:46.376]  Not by accident.
[02:45:46.376 --> 02:45:49.398]  I gave the other way, he came, went away.
[02:45:49.398 --> 02:45:52.000]  And as an officer, do you have a problem with my shirt?
[02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:54.322]  Because it's in my shorts here.
[02:45:54.322 --> 02:45:56.663]  And he just looked away, and then he came back and said,
[02:45:59.531 --> 02:46:01.693]  I don't want to become a target.
[02:46:01.693 --> 02:46:07.078]  This police officer has a problem with someone who keeps his oath.
[02:46:07.078 --> 02:46:09.380]  He took the oath too, same.
[02:46:09.380 --> 02:46:12.663]  He was saying he didn't want to become a target or you're one?
[02:46:12.663 --> 02:46:17.827]  He says, read it to me, I don't want to become a target.
[02:46:17.827 --> 02:46:21.471]  So the police officers are under pressure, at least some of them,
[02:46:22.677 --> 02:46:25.198]  To say, okay, I stay to my oath.
[02:46:25.198 --> 02:46:26.419]  I will not obey.
[02:46:26.419 --> 02:46:27.039]  Oh, no, no, no.
[02:46:27.039 --> 02:46:29.140]  We've confirmed and it's come out in documents.
[02:46:29.140 --> 02:46:34.523]  Oath keepers Ron Paul, Alex Jones, they sit up there with the military and police and say, these are bad men.
[02:46:34.523 --> 02:46:36.163]  Don't listen to them.
[02:46:36.163 --> 02:46:37.544]  Pull them over if you see this.
[02:46:37.544 --> 02:46:41.366]  I mean, of course, this is the, probably the front runner on the Republican Party.
[02:46:41.366 --> 02:46:43.767]  And they still have manuals saying he's evil.
[02:46:43.767 --> 02:46:45.568]  I mean, how can police not know?
[02:46:45.568 --> 02:46:47.589]  The bad guys tell you stuff like that.
[02:46:48.229 --> 02:46:50.091]  This is obviously the bad guys.
[02:46:50.091 --> 02:46:53.814]  This is the bureaucracy that's engaged in all the crimes.
[02:46:53.814 --> 02:46:54.915]  I'm sorry, I'm ranting.
[02:46:54.915 --> 02:46:59.900]  Continue with your stories of parallels you see.
[02:46:59.900 --> 02:47:05.405]  The next thing is, in East Germany,
[02:47:06.581 --> 02:47:08.082]  We have documents.
[02:47:08.082 --> 02:47:17.271]  You could clearly tell the party, here, this is our constitution, and here is our regulation of service, and here is written what I have to do.
[02:47:17.271 --> 02:47:22.376]  I have not to obey an order against constitution, against our people.
[02:47:23.217 --> 02:47:25.418]  You could say and could show this.
[02:47:25.418 --> 02:47:27.740]  Here, there's no question about it.
[02:47:27.740 --> 02:47:30.902]  You are a terrorist if you believe in the Constitution.
[02:47:30.902 --> 02:47:32.003]  So it's worse.
[02:47:32.003 --> 02:47:32.683]  It's worse.
[02:47:32.683 --> 02:47:33.964]  It's more.
[02:47:33.964 --> 02:47:41.068]  I mean, here's the ADL having secret meetings with law enforcement saying, if you talk about small government, you are a terrorist.
[02:47:41.068 --> 02:47:42.990]  I mean, that is obviously terrorism.
[02:47:42.990 --> 02:47:46.232]  Look, and see, by the Patriot Act, they can look you away.
[02:47:47.148 --> 02:47:48.389]  Without any reason.
[02:47:48.389 --> 02:47:49.230]  No evidence.
[02:47:49.230 --> 02:47:50.772]  You have no right to call them.
[02:47:50.772 --> 02:47:53.334]  And now they want to use the military against the people.
[02:47:53.334 --> 02:47:56.318]  This is the next step about the party election.
[02:47:56.318 --> 02:48:00.162]  And the party election is extended.
[02:48:00.162 --> 02:48:02.704]  Actually it ran out half a year ago.
[02:48:02.704 --> 02:48:06.088]  And there was a vote in the Congress.
[02:48:07.443 --> 02:48:09.406]  And they voted to extend the Patriot Act.
[02:48:09.406 --> 02:48:11.929]  This is absolutely against the Constitution.
[02:48:11.929 --> 02:48:12.410]  Yeah.
[02:48:12.410 --> 02:48:19.200]  And when the Stasi arrested me, they had to do something after I saw them in my apartment.
[02:48:19.200 --> 02:48:20.101]  So they arrested me.
[02:48:21.338 --> 02:48:33.221]  And our commander said, okay, you have five days time to the Stasi has five days time to provide some evidence against me or I'm back in service.
[02:48:33.221 --> 02:48:37.422]  So our government tramples on rides worse than the Stasi.
[02:48:37.422 --> 02:48:38.622]  Yes.
[02:48:38.622 --> 02:48:42.683]  I had the right five days and they had to show evidence.
[02:48:42.683 --> 02:48:46.024]  He can arrest you, can arrest me here without evidence.
[02:48:47.196 --> 02:48:48.497]  Without any right.
[02:48:48.497 --> 02:48:54.159]  What do you think of the fact that Homeland Security hired Marcus Wolf as a consultant?
[02:48:54.159 --> 02:48:57.000]  Well, good work.
[02:48:57.000 --> 02:48:58.541]  They may need him.
[02:48:58.541 --> 02:49:05.784]  Well, he died a few years after that, but the point is that they would... I mean, it's so clear-cut tyranny.
[02:49:05.784 --> 02:49:15.889]  What do you think of the TSA, and they do violate the Constitution, Fourth Amendment, groping children, microwaving people, and now highway checkpoints?
[02:49:17.984 --> 02:49:19.867]  It's completely against the Constitution.
[02:49:19.867 --> 02:49:25.855]  What would the Germans have done in East Germany if they had checkpoints where they fondled your children?
[02:49:25.855 --> 02:49:29.881]  There were checkpoints around Berlin in the beginning, in the first years.
[02:49:29.881 --> 02:49:32.104]  Because there was no border, it was open.
[02:49:32.104 --> 02:49:33.265]  Shortly after the war, yeah?
[02:49:34.184 --> 02:49:35.705]  of the World War II.
[02:49:35.705 --> 02:49:39.206]  But there was never checkpoints anywhere in Germany.
[02:49:39.206 --> 02:49:50.212]  So again, we're worse than East Germany, all we have left is free speech, and they're in the news, saying get rid of freedom of speech, and openly, Cass Sunstein calling for alternative media's arrest.
[02:49:50.212 --> 02:49:52.833]  I mean, they are bonafide tyrants.
[02:49:52.833 --> 02:50:01.677]  The only check in East Germany was for crime when they search for someone, but there were no regular checkpoints anywhere in East Germany.
[02:50:01.677 --> 02:50:02.618]  It was a socialistic
[02:50:03.859 --> 02:50:08.444]  What would the East Germans have done if they did TSA type stuff?
[02:50:08.444 --> 02:50:12.569]  Would the revolt have come sooner?
[02:50:12.569 --> 02:50:16.354]  East Germans wouldn't put up with what happens in America.
[02:50:16.354 --> 02:50:17.075]  There was no way.
[02:50:19.321 --> 02:50:19.421]  It's
[02:50:37.617 --> 02:50:38.699]  George Washington is bad.
[02:50:38.699 --> 02:50:46.831]  I mean, I actually have video of FEMA with ADL Southern Primary Law Center training manuals that wrote a tyranny saying, George Washington, terrorist, Thomas Jefferson, terrorist.
[02:50:46.831 --> 02:50:49.354]  And the cops are all... I mean, it's like saying...
[02:50:50.828 --> 02:50:54.409]  I mean it's so absurd you think it's a comedy and it's not.
[02:50:54.409 --> 02:50:58.129]  They really are bad guys and they think they're the good guys.
[02:50:58.129 --> 02:50:59.270]  We'll be right back.
[02:50:59.270 --> 02:51:01.390]  Stay with us on the other side.
[02:51:01.390 --> 02:51:04.371]  As we age, we lose both strength and muscle mass.
[02:51:04.371 --> 02:51:10.432]  Undamaged whey protein from grass-fed cows is nature's most powerful food to gain back lost muscle.
[02:51:10.432 --> 02:51:15.693]  Virtually all whey protein powders or drinks have been damaged during processing or are high in sugar.
[02:51:15.913 --> 02:51:21.956]  This damaged whey causes a significant loss in the ability of the body to build new muscle proteins.
[02:51:21.956 --> 02:51:27.738]  The high sugar content will stop all the benefits of your growth hormone from causing muscle repair.
[02:51:27.738 --> 02:51:35.081]  By giving your body easily absorbed, undamaged whey free of added sugar, you may be able to gain back lost muscle and strength.
[02:51:35.081 --> 02:51:39.623]  One World Whey is truly undamaged whey protein powder free of added sugar.
[02:51:39.623 --> 02:51:45.006]  Both young and elderly are reporting increases in muscle strength and size without any additional exercise.
[02:51:45.486 --> 02:51:46.007]  We're good to go.
[02:52:01.468 --> 02:52:07.331]  Attention GCN listeners, do you have a patriot on your Christmas list that's nearly impossible to shop for?

[02:54:17.242 --> 02:54:20.303]  Pentagon drones now targeting rural Americans.
[02:54:20.303 --> 02:54:22.364]  That report's up at InfoWars.com.
[02:54:22.364 --> 02:54:30.167]  And we've got Michael Savage withdrawing his million-dollar offer because multiple states are saying it's illegal to tell Newt Gingrich to drop out for a million bucks.
[02:54:30.167 --> 02:54:33.089]  It's obviously a tongue-in-cheek publicity stunt.
[02:54:33.089 --> 02:54:33.689]  That's up there.
[02:54:33.689 --> 02:54:37.471]  Cheney said that Obama should have attacked Iran to destroy drone.
[02:54:38.351 --> 02:54:40.473]  That's the guy trying to start a war with Russia.
[02:54:40.473 --> 02:54:41.754]  The whole Georgia situation.
[02:54:41.754 --> 02:54:45.578]  Just because you're about to die doesn't mean all of us have to die.
[02:54:45.578 --> 02:54:50.022]  Also Ron Paul outlines his campaign's secret weapon from our interview yesterday.
[02:54:50.022 --> 02:54:51.344]  That's up there.
[02:54:51.344 --> 02:54:55.247]  Iran reiterates its threat to close the Strait of Hormuz if attacked.
[02:54:56.158 --> 02:54:56.938]  When I came to the U.S.
[02:54:56.938 --> 02:54:58.519]  13 years ago, to the U.S., I had no idea about America.
[02:55:20.865 --> 02:55:31.935]  Without the normal information, and I studied first the Constitution to understand, understand the lifestyle here, understand more about politics, how it works.
[02:55:31.935 --> 02:55:35.459]  And the Constitution, when I compare it with the Constitution we had,
[02:55:36.758 --> 02:55:47.283]  Our was new, because it was 40 years old, and was actually written very well, but there's a huge difference between both, even if it was correct.
[02:55:47.283 --> 02:55:54.707]  The constitution in all other states, even East Germany, was written to tell how the government can rule the people.
[02:55:55.612 --> 02:55:58.295]  The people are the sovereign, not the government.
[02:55:58.295 --> 02:55:58.355]  Yes.
[02:56:10.168 --> 02:56:20.694]  So, and then history, how it came to the United States, the Dorling First Colonies, and the Bill of Rights.
[02:56:20.694 --> 02:56:27.938]  When you go to the Bill of Rights, I heard a very good explanation about this, very short, from Judge Andrew Napolitano.
[02:56:27.938 --> 02:56:28.359]  He said,
[02:56:29.399 --> 02:56:32.902]  Uh, Amendment 1 says government, you cannot do this.
[02:56:32.902 --> 02:56:36.105]  Amendment 2 says government, you cannot do this.
[02:56:36.105 --> 02:56:39.808]  Amendment 9 says government, you cannot do this.
[02:56:39.808 --> 02:56:45.433]  Amendment 10 says, and if you have someone forgotten, you can't do it either.
[02:56:45.433 --> 02:56:47.715]  The whole thing is about binding down government.
[02:56:47.715 --> 02:56:50.217]  Now it's been turned all the way around backwards.
[02:56:50.217 --> 02:56:53.199]  And the media will blame the Constitution for the situation we're in.
[02:56:53.199 --> 02:56:55.061]  We've gotten the situation because we've ignored it.
[02:56:55.061 --> 02:56:56.542]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:56:57.563 --> 02:57:04.290]  I mean, I heard our now president say the Constitution says what the government not can do.
[02:57:04.290 --> 02:57:08.794]  But the Constitution says not what we all can do for our people.
[02:57:08.794 --> 02:57:14.500]  Is this not a service of the question of the government to rule our lives?
[02:57:14.500 --> 02:57:19.985]  What do you think of just the open announcements that torture is good, secret arrest is good?
[02:57:19.985 --> 02:57:21.086]  It is like a bad dream.
[02:57:22.068 --> 02:57:23.250]  It is.
[02:57:23.250 --> 02:57:28.436]  And I have lots of discussions with my American friends about terrorists.
[02:57:28.436 --> 02:57:31.961]  I mean, yes, what was the last one killed in Yemen?
[02:57:31.961 --> 02:57:33.503]  It was actually in America.
[02:57:33.503 --> 02:57:33.863]  Yeah.
[02:57:33.863 --> 02:57:38.849]  So from my opinion, the Constitution says pretty clear.
[02:57:38.849 --> 02:57:39.590]  You have to write
[02:57:40.640 --> 02:57:45.643]  Well, that's right.
[02:57:45.643 --> 02:57:46.864]  How do we know he was a terrorist?
[02:57:46.864 --> 02:57:48.284]  They told us so.
[02:57:48.284 --> 02:57:53.408]  This precedent of we kill you and just believe us, but they're a group of known liars.
[02:57:53.408 --> 02:57:56.369]  They don't want a court hearing because they don't want it to come out that he worked for them.
[02:57:56.369 --> 02:57:57.230]  By the way, he did.
[02:57:57.230 --> 02:57:58.410]  That did come out in the news.
[02:57:58.410 --> 02:58:00.392]  Or that the underwear bomber was gotten on the plane.
[02:58:01.212 --> 02:58:02.793]  That's why they don't want a trial.
[02:58:02.793 --> 02:58:08.276]  And this guy, the last terrorist who got killed, was never convicted with any crime.
[02:58:08.276 --> 02:58:10.498]  And there were two men more in the car.
[02:58:10.498 --> 02:58:12.399]  They killed three with a drone.
[02:58:12.399 --> 02:58:13.099]  Two men more.
[02:58:13.099 --> 02:58:15.561]  They had no idea who they are.
[02:58:15.561 --> 02:58:19.824]  And they heard on TV, ah, they have to be bad guys too when you're on the same car.
[02:58:22.041 --> 02:58:26.383]  And now they're saying the army will use the drones against us, and now they're doing it.
[02:58:26.383 --> 02:58:29.885]  I mean, the bill hasn't even completely passed yet, and it's already happening.
[02:58:29.885 --> 02:58:30.466]  That's in the news.
[02:58:30.466 --> 02:58:33.227]  They say it's against the law, but so what?
[02:58:33.227 --> 02:58:35.128]  The American people will put up with anything.
[02:58:35.128 --> 02:58:39.771]  Tonight, 7 o'clock, InfoWars Nightly News with Wayne Madsen on Fast and Furious Breaking Info.
