[00:00:04.946 --> 00:00:09.130]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:10.591]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.371 --> 00:00:13.273]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.293 --> 00:00:16.596]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.096 --> 00:00:21.159]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.373 --> 00:00:31.254]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:31.354 --> 00:00:31.814]  Welcome.
[00:00:31.894 --> 00:00:32.955]  We are live.
[00:00:32.995 --> 00:00:35.096]  It is Tuesday, the seventh day of June, 2011.
[00:00:35.656 --> 00:00:39.939]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:42.901]  Our frequent guest pops in every month or two.
[00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:50.565]  Jesse Ventura, former Minnesota governor, will be joining us coming up at the middle of the next hour.
[00:00:51.106 --> 00:00:54.508]  And I do plan to take some phone calls for Governor Ventura today.
[00:00:55.427 --> 00:01:01.749]  There is so much news to cover, so much to talk about on Wienergate.
[00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.470]  Of course, overall, that's a diversion and a distraction, but it shows how these politicians lie.
[00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.391]  Just last week, he was saying I was hacked, the photo's not real.
[00:01:12.751 --> 00:01:16.312]  Then he said, well, the photo might be me, and now, yeah, I sent it, and I sent hundreds of them.
[00:01:17.392 --> 00:01:24.294]  And, of course, just a week ago, he was saying that Brett Bart was a liar, the guy that heads up biggovernment.com.
[00:01:25.254 --> 00:01:32.357]  The drudge protégé, who dominates so much of the media now, and it was, you know, trying to go after Brett Bart saying it wasn't true.
[00:01:32.417 --> 00:01:47.724]  And Wiener's known for targeting people like Glenn Beck and his sponsors, and so Brett Bart said, if you continue to target me and lie about me, and, you know, say that I ought to get in trouble for lying when I didn't lie, I'm going to release all the other photos I've got.
[00:01:48.624 --> 00:01:50.805]  And the media spun that like, oh, it's blackmail.
[00:01:50.885 --> 00:01:51.385]  No, it's not.
[00:01:51.445 --> 00:01:52.646]  He's saying, look, buddy.
[00:01:53.928 --> 00:01:55.869]  Stop attacking me and saying I'm a liar.
[00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:57.910]  I'll release all of the photos, Weiner.
[00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.532]  I'll release the photos of your namesake.
[00:02:02.752 --> 00:02:04.573]  So, back off, pal.
[00:02:04.913 --> 00:02:08.555]  Weiner is a very manipulative, deceptive person.
[00:02:08.575 --> 00:02:11.536]  And you've got John Edwards, of course, caught lying.
[00:02:12.336 --> 00:02:13.437]  Now he's being prosecuted.
[00:02:15.249 --> 00:02:18.570]  Because it is a money laundering situation in election law.
[00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:30.214]  My issue here is, if you're Obama, or you're the rest of his cohorts of the Clintons, or you're Republican establishment people, you can get away with murder.
[00:02:31.154 --> 00:02:32.014]  You can do whatever you want.
[00:02:32.654 --> 00:02:43.998]  So the media loves to grab this money for a sexual scandal because it's only connected to those two individuals, and it doesn't bring up issues of general corruption in the government.
[00:02:45.394 --> 00:02:46.975]  The overall corruption.
[00:02:47.455 --> 00:02:50.177]  It's just a sexual issue, so it's individualized.
[00:02:51.037 --> 00:02:59.542]  It's not the open corruption of Obama issuing thousands of waivers to major companies to not buy their employees insurance if they give him campaign money.
[00:02:59.562 --> 00:03:08.707]  You give Obama money, pennies on the dollar, he then says, well you don't have to get, in the case of McDonald's, billions of dollars in insurance they'd have to pay for
[00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.781]  Over the next decade, conservatively.
[00:03:12.261 --> 00:03:14.822]  So you give me a few million bucks, I give you billions.
[00:03:15.582 --> 00:03:18.103]  And then your competition won't be able to compete, you can shut them down.
[00:03:18.403 --> 00:03:21.184]  And I know I talk about that, or at least mention that every day.
[00:03:21.864 --> 00:03:32.328]  Because it's such a open, naked, in-your-face, no-debate-about-it, racketeering, unfair trade practices, bribery situation.
[00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:33.369]  Openly.
[00:03:34.029 --> 00:03:36.690]  And it's thousands of these waivers now to major companies.
[00:03:37.865 --> 00:03:44.886]  And McDonald's and others, McDonald's was the first now last year to get the waiver, and then their hundreds of thousands of employees are exempt.
[00:03:46.630 --> 00:04:04.474]  But if I want to go start a hamburger place, and all of this goes through, and it's going to go through by the end of the year, I'll have to tell people, well, sorry, I would pay you $12 an hour, or $10 an hour, but I'm going to have to pay you minimum wage, $6, because I've got to take that money and buy the insurance.
[00:04:04.494 --> 00:04:07.015]  They're like, I don't want it, or give me my own money, I'll get my own insurance.
[00:04:07.575 --> 00:04:08.055]  Sorry!
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.061]  I gotta do it!
[00:04:10.201 --> 00:04:13.784]  And of course insurance prices are now going up, they're cutting the quality of the care.
[00:04:14.085 --> 00:04:33.024]  Well of course the insurance companies on record bragged to the Wall Street Journal, their head lobbyist for the lobbying consortium, that the insurance companies and big healthcare provider systems, this will just shut down all their competition and they'll just pass the cost on to you and they wrote the stinking bill.
[00:04:35.566 --> 00:04:36.346]  Didn't matter, though.
[00:04:37.367 --> 00:04:43.809]  Their propaganda corps posed as bleeding-heart liberal socialists and ran around saying you're a racist and hate black people.
[00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:47.250]  If you don't go for this healthcare, you're like, what does black people have to do with this?
[00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:48.750]  Shut up, Klan member!
[00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.271]  Remember, um...
[00:04:51.584 --> 00:04:56.008]  People like Slimeball, Chris Matthews, Carlos Watson and all of them.
[00:04:56.028 --> 00:04:57.430]  I mean, Mr. Maddow.
[00:04:58.351 --> 00:04:59.852]  It's just, it's incredible.
[00:05:00.353 --> 00:05:05.337]  You've heard Alex Jones talk about eFoods Direct and their highly nutritious, long-term, storable food.
[00:05:05.778 --> 00:05:06.959]  Believe me, it tastes great.

[00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.041]  Let's say you order three of their one-week responder kits.

[00:05:15.861 --> 00:05:18.702]  That's a $75 savings and a one-month supply.
[00:05:19.042 --> 00:05:19.982]  Are you kidding me?
[00:05:20.162 --> 00:05:26.224]  For the cost of one greasy fast-food super-sized combo lunch, you can eat three hearty, delicious meals.
[00:05:26.684 --> 00:05:29.685]  And this offer is good for any of their quick fix supplies.

[00:05:32.306 --> 00:05:36.188]  eFoodsDirect is prepared for these troubled times and will ship your order within 48 hours.

[00:06:04.224 --> 00:06:05.125]  Tyranny is here.
[00:06:05.485 --> 00:06:09.228]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:06:09.348 --> 00:06:11.630]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:17.094]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:06:17.514 --> 00:06:23.779]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:06:24.179 --> 00:06:29.744]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:06:30.164 --> 00:06:33.847]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:06:34.327 --> 00:06:38.309]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:44.113]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:06:44.573 --> 00:06:47.515]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:06:48.115 --> 00:06:49.556]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:06:50.096 --> 00:06:50.596]  It's here.

[00:07:00.373 --> 00:07:05.755]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:07:07.015 --> 00:07:11.797]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:07:12.157 --> 00:07:18.939]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.181]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:07:24.961 --> 00:07:26.902]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:07:29.384 --> 00:07:33.267]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:07:33.988 --> 00:07:37.090]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[00:07:37.811 --> 00:07:38.632]  Others don't.
[00:07:39.032 --> 00:07:40.933]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:07:41.194 --> 00:07:42.695]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:07:42.975 --> 00:07:45.537]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:07:45.857 --> 00:07:52.122]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.

[00:07:55.185 --> 00:07:57.227]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[00:07:57.567 --> 00:07:58.428]  Others don't.
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:05.385]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:05.745 --> 00:08:08.027]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:22.065 --> 00:08:23.967]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:23.987 --> 00:08:27.992]  It is Tuesday, of course, the seventh day of June 2011.
[00:08:28.353 --> 00:08:31.336]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:08:31.977 --> 00:08:40.328]  Joining us at the bottom of the next hour, into the third hour, former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura joins us to talk about his new New York Times best-selling book.
[00:08:41.368 --> 00:08:52.814]  63 documents the government doesn't want you to read and we'll of course cover a lot of the different News developments that are taking place around the world with Ventura always interesting and informative.
[00:08:53.314 --> 00:08:53.635]  Okay.
[00:08:53.675 --> 00:08:54.255]  Here's the deal.
[00:08:55.656 --> 00:09:05.521]  I Want to get into the TSA a little bit more today Because well, we're getting more numbers out on the tens of billions of dollars that the United States is losing
[00:09:06.769 --> 00:09:07.630]  From terrorism.
[00:09:08.631 --> 00:09:13.655]  That's not counting people domestically who are cutting way back on their travel and all the numbers show that.
[00:09:13.695 --> 00:09:19.460]  That's estimated, CNN reported two years ago because of increased security, to be $10 billion a year.
[00:09:20.181 --> 00:09:27.387]  It's a lot more than that with folks from Europe who would come here and see the Grand Canyon or go to Florida or go CDC.
[00:09:27.808 --> 00:09:28.669]  They will not come here.
[00:09:29.289 --> 00:09:37.095]  Because all of the foreigners, reportedly, get forced into the microwave ovens, they get biometrically scanned, and many of them get their genitals scrubbed.
[00:09:37.615 --> 00:09:39.717]  There's a London Telegraph article today.
[00:09:40.097 --> 00:09:44.360]  Cruise passengers tell of seven hours security revenge nightmare.
[00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:55.288]  They were retina scanned, thumbprinted, made to stand in the hot sun, close to 100 degrees, for eight hours, and were told, it's because you complained about the security.
[00:09:56.068 --> 00:10:02.871]  And TSA's been on record before going wild on people and saying, we're punishing you.
[00:10:03.492 --> 00:10:11.536]  Meanwhile, the illegal aliens are running around everywhere, working at government facilities, working at restaurants everywhere in the government.
[00:10:12.396 --> 00:10:24.860]  Every year does two or three staged bust at meatpacking plants and arrest a thousand or so people and it even came out in Fox News a couple years ago that they didn't take them directly to ICE and give them green cards in most cases and release them.
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:39.645]  It's also come out this year a group of sheriffs have gone on record with Border Patrol agents and said that the feds order the Border Patrol to not arrest illegals except for during small quota periods as part of PR stunts.
[00:10:40.365 --> 00:10:55.800]  And it's come out for many, many years, of course, that sheriffs in Tennessee, Georgia, you name it, will arrest, say, a car, in one case, of 14 illegal aliens with a bunch of marijuana and whiskey, drunk, drunk driving, and the sheriff's holding them, and the feds won't come pick them up.
[00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:04.088]  Or, I saw a few years ago, a Houston Chronicle article that reported hundreds of thousands of illegals in one year released from Texas jails.
[00:11:05.231 --> 00:11:15.479]  And it's been in Texas, local Austin News, and I've talked to some of the folks that work down at the courthouse, where judges will give illegals $5 fines for drunk driving.
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.782]  So they get a get-out-of-jail-free card.
[00:11:19.322 --> 00:11:26.688]  But if you're a rich European trying to, or a wealthy or middle-class person trying to come here and spend money, you are going to be put to the ringer.
[00:11:27.228 --> 00:11:31.131]  Just like American citizens are put to the ringer, it's about slave training.
[00:11:31.472 --> 00:11:34.314]  So I want to break down some of that article, and there's an American Dream story.
[00:11:34.814 --> 00:11:38.677]  Are ridiculous airport security measures killing airline profits?
[00:11:38.737 --> 00:11:43.100]  They go over some of the numbers of that, the tens of billions of dollars being lost.
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.441]  During the years of 2008-2009, airlines combined lost $23 billion.
[00:11:45.461 --> 00:11:46.682]  Now remember that
[00:11:52.742 --> 00:12:16.402]  Going back last year when the TSA situation came to a head, and was one of the biggest news stories in the world, that the airline lobbies came out and said get rid of the TSA groping and microwave ovens, scanners, and we saw the National Hotel Association come out, the National Tourism Associations come out, the airline pilot unions came out, and they said this has got to stop.
[00:12:16.422 --> 00:12:19.685]  And they said okay, we won't grope the genitals of the pilots.
[00:12:20.425 --> 00:12:21.905]  Obviously, they're going to fly the airplane.
[00:12:21.965 --> 00:12:27.386]  I mean, if you trust them to fly the airplane, they don't need to be searched, folks, because if they want to kill people, they can.
[00:12:28.007 --> 00:12:28.887]  I mean, it's asinine.
[00:12:29.367 --> 00:12:33.468]  We can't trust pilots, but we trust these TSA people.
[00:12:33.928 --> 00:12:35.908]  I mean, who would take the job?
[00:12:36.588 --> 00:12:43.470]  Who would take the job to want to sit there and grope people all day and to have folks hating you?
[00:12:44.301 --> 00:12:53.387]  I mean, you couldn't pay me $10 million a year to sit there and run my hands over men's genitals.
[00:12:53.547 --> 00:12:54.387]  I mean, you couldn't do it.
[00:12:54.707 --> 00:12:56.669]  You couldn't pay me $10 million to do it to women!
[00:12:57.249 --> 00:13:01.031]  And I have less aversion to that, because I don't like making people do things.
[00:13:01.131 --> 00:13:03.433]  I don't like forcing myself on people.
[00:13:03.573 --> 00:13:06.275]  I don't have a desire to put my hands on people.
[00:13:07.355 --> 00:13:07.956]  I mean, it is...
[00:13:09.178 --> 00:13:10.439]  Well, I'm starting to rant.
[00:13:10.519 --> 00:13:12.261]  That's one of the things I want to get into.
[00:13:13.342 --> 00:13:19.146]  Also, the Democrats are really starting to turn against Obama because he didn't deliver free houses, free cars.
[00:13:19.166 --> 00:13:22.229]  Remember all the people chanting, thank you so much, Mr. President, you've been elected.
[00:13:22.249 --> 00:13:26.192]  Now I don't have to worry about my tuition or my car or my rent or my home.
[00:13:27.553 --> 00:13:29.155]  Oh, thank you, everything's fine.
[00:13:29.175 --> 00:13:32.858]  And women standing up and saying, please, Mr. President, give me a free house.
[00:13:33.538 --> 00:13:36.101]  And he's like, all right, we're going to take care of that for you, sure.
[00:13:36.994 --> 00:13:46.877]  I mean, they thought that they were going to get this big free deal, and they did not get the big free deal.
[00:13:48.598 --> 00:13:54.700]  So continuing here, on college campuses, Obama's not cool anymore.
[00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:59.482]  Yeah, let me tell you, just six months ago, I still saw a lot of Obama
[00:14:04.568 --> 00:14:06.950]  Bumper stickers and things in Austin.
[00:14:07.791 --> 00:14:10.093]  I mean, two years ago, three years ago, they were everywhere.
[00:14:10.173 --> 00:14:11.935]  Now, six months ago, not so much.
[00:14:12.035 --> 00:14:14.637]  Now, I see almost zero.
[00:14:16.158 --> 00:14:19.681]  But don't worry, they're soon all gonna have their Rick Perry stickers on their cars.
[00:14:19.741 --> 00:14:23.325]  I heard a guy Sunday night, when I was driving home after doing my own broadcast on 590 AM,
[00:14:25.163 --> 00:14:27.724]  on the Kenny Romire Show that does weekends over there.
[00:14:28.464 --> 00:14:31.965]  And I heard Democrat for Democrat call in and go, I like Obama.
[00:14:32.025 --> 00:14:32.866]  I voted for him.
[00:14:33.246 --> 00:14:34.506]  And he's done what he said he'd do.
[00:14:34.566 --> 00:14:37.127]  But I got to tell you, I'll vote for Perry if he runs.
[00:14:37.787 --> 00:14:41.368]  And it's because they think Perry belongs to them because they live in Texas.
[00:14:41.809 --> 00:14:48.811]  It's like, well, I was a Dallas Cowboys fan, but now I've moved to Seattle, so I'm a Seahawks fan.
[00:14:50.127 --> 00:14:57.093]  They associate their personal power with the president, who's a teleprompter reading nobody.
[00:14:57.674 --> 00:14:59.055]  So was George W. Bush.
[00:15:00.056 --> 00:15:05.760]  The foreign megabanks openly own both parties, except if you talk about a few people like Ron Paul.
[00:15:06.141 --> 00:15:06.821]  They own it all.
[00:15:07.161 --> 00:15:08.983]  They finance Mitt Romney.
[00:15:09.283 --> 00:15:12.666]  They're financing Obama right now.
[00:15:12.686 --> 00:15:16.449]  They're financing all the major players, Newt Gingrich, all of it.
[00:15:16.809 --> 00:15:18.451]  And Mitt Romney was for the bailout.
[00:15:19.298 --> 00:15:22.761]  Newt Gingrich was for the bailout, even though he was not in office but politically promoted it.
[00:15:23.562 --> 00:15:25.004]  Glenn Beck was for the bailout.
[00:15:26.565 --> 00:15:27.446]  All of these people.
[00:15:27.806 --> 00:15:35.394]  Democrats were for it because when you get down to key issues of doing what the fraudulent hijacker owners of this country
[00:15:36.547 --> 00:15:38.968]  They've taken the country over through fraud, but they think they own it.
[00:15:39.809 --> 00:15:43.791]  They will get the lion's share of our tax money if we don't have an awakening to this.
[00:15:43.831 --> 00:15:47.253]  But the good news is, people are waking up to the puppet that is Obama.
[00:15:48.273 --> 00:15:56.698]  And Carville, the big Clinton advisor, has come out and said that Obama is facing serious, imminent civil unrest.
[00:15:57.478 --> 00:15:59.000]  If he doesn't get the economy going.
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:03.525]  Well, his job is to destroy the economy and vertically integrate it, just like Bush's was.
[00:16:04.026 --> 00:16:06.048]  That's in the IMF World Bank documents.
[00:16:06.108 --> 00:16:06.949]  It is the policies.
[00:16:07.289 --> 00:16:10.373]  It's command destruction by these pirates.
[00:16:11.234 --> 00:16:13.236]  But here's the Washington Post turning against Obama.
[00:16:13.556 --> 00:16:16.560]  President Obama's phony accounting on the auto industry bailout.
[00:16:17.759 --> 00:16:22.064]  And he goes over the fact that you taxpayers did indeed pay for it and we haven't been paid back.
[00:16:22.104 --> 00:16:22.665]  Of course not.
[00:16:23.105 --> 00:16:29.072]  And GM publicly used that money to move plants to Brazil, China and Eastern Europe.
[00:16:29.693 --> 00:16:33.077]  Billions and billions of that bailout money on record went to that.
[00:16:33.758 --> 00:16:35.220]  And GM is in the news today.
[00:16:36.482 --> 00:16:42.805]  I've got that in my stack, saying we need to raise, the head of GM calls for the federal government to raise gas taxes.
[00:16:43.305 --> 00:16:53.190]  This is a multinational corporation guy who's bought and paid for and merged with the government, that's fascism, saying raise gas taxes.
[00:16:53.210 --> 00:17:01.774]  And what do you see Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, the current head of the Fed, Ben Bernanke, former head of the Fed,
[00:17:03.809 --> 00:17:06.730]  Alan Greenspan, they're all on the news every week!
[00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:15.912]  On This Week on ABC, and Good Morning America, and CNN saying, we need to raise taxes on everybody to fix America.
[00:17:16.092 --> 00:17:20.613]  Because they're all offshore, on record, and pay almost zero tax.
[00:17:20.913 --> 00:17:27.575]  It just came out that Bono, of U2, has been calling to globally raise taxes, and who is on the UN payroll.
[00:17:29.099 --> 00:17:34.623]  And is allowed, because he's in the inside club, to pay almost zero tax.
[00:17:34.943 --> 00:17:39.066]  There's Bono, worth close to a billion dollars, saying raise taxes on us.
[00:17:39.446 --> 00:17:42.068]  Schwarzenegger, worth over two billion dollars.
[00:17:42.288 --> 00:17:44.389]  He's close to three billion, I saw on Forbes.
[00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:46.251]  Always calling to raise our taxes.
[00:17:46.711 --> 00:17:48.312]  Alan Greenspan, raise our taxes.
[00:17:49.093 --> 00:17:50.714]  Henry Paulson, raise our taxes.
[00:17:51.114 --> 00:17:56.678]  Raise our taxes, raise our taxes, raise our taxes, because the money goes to them.
[00:17:57.845 --> 00:18:05.979]  Most of your tax money doesn't go to the welfare queen, doesn't go to the cop, doesn't go to even government.
[00:18:06.339 --> 00:18:07.541]  It goes to interest on the debt.
[00:18:07.561 --> 00:18:08.643]  And who gets that interest money?
[00:18:08.984 --> 00:18:11.868]  The foreign private Federal Reserve banking cartel.
[00:18:13.055 --> 00:18:15.036]  And I wish people would get that through their heads.
[00:18:15.056 --> 00:18:25.100]  When you see the richest people in the world constantly up there saying, we've got to help the poor, we've got to raise taxes, on and on and on and on.
[00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:28.221]  They are getting the money through the government conduit.
[00:18:28.761 --> 00:18:32.503]  And that's why General Motors, government controlled and partially owned now,
[00:18:33.403 --> 00:18:43.206]  is there getting your taxpayer money to those private shareholders saying they want to raise your gas taxes to socially force you to buy a smaller car.
[00:18:43.566 --> 00:18:45.667]  Well, I'm sorry, I've got a wife and three children.
[00:18:46.547 --> 00:18:50.568]  I'm sorry, I've seen the statistics of how dangerous those little tin cans are.
[00:18:51.388 --> 00:18:51.728]  Okay?
[00:18:52.108 --> 00:18:56.069]  I drive cars that have safe safety records.
[00:18:56.810 --> 00:19:01.011]  I drive a car that's got a titanium cage in it.
[00:19:01.991 --> 00:19:07.394]  Because I know the number one cause of death until I hit about 55 is that automobile parked out there in the parking lot.
[00:19:08.034 --> 00:19:10.276]  So you better believe I got a titanium cage around me.
[00:19:12.437 --> 00:19:13.417]  And it's that simple.
[00:19:13.717 --> 00:19:18.240]  But they don't have those in the little tin cans because it makes them way too much.
[00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:19.961]  The tin cans aren't safe.
[00:19:20.021 --> 00:19:27.865]  They're little plastic machines and I'm not going to drive around with gigantic SUVs all over the place in a tin can that nobody sees.
[00:19:28.506 --> 00:19:28.986]  So you bet.
[00:19:29.286 --> 00:19:29.986]  I got an SUV.
[00:19:31.247 --> 00:19:35.449]  And you bet, I got a Dodge Charger, German designed, with a cage in it.
[00:19:36.049 --> 00:19:37.509]  And I'm going to continue to drive that.
[00:19:37.969 --> 00:19:40.490]  Of course, they're going to continue to jack up the prices and try to shut us down.
[00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:41.311]  Okay, I'm ranting.
[00:19:41.651 --> 00:19:46.833]  I want to get into the nature of lying politicians and why do we believe anything they say.
[00:19:47.193 --> 00:19:49.994]  And I want to talk about Wiener Gate when we get back.
[00:19:50.014 --> 00:19:52.174]  Then we're getting into the latest on the E. coli outbreak.
[00:19:52.194 --> 00:19:54.555]  It's now reportedly hit the U.S.
[00:19:55.236 --> 00:19:55.996]  and a lot more.

[00:20:01.158 --> 00:20:05.200]  The number one secret to having great health and long life is having high levels of glutathione.

[00:20:17.045 --> 00:20:24.488]  The results of optimal levels of glutathione in your body are more mental and physical energy, stronger immune system, greater endurance, and more.

[00:21:59.861 --> 00:22:01.123]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:22:01.163 --> 00:22:06.530]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:11.396]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:22:11.777 --> 00:22:12.177]  It's true.
[00:22:12.257 --> 00:22:16.823]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:22:17.344 --> 00:22:22.049]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:24.512]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[00:22:24.892 --> 00:22:29.497]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:22:29.698 --> 00:22:30.599]  And here's the best part.
[00:22:30.819 --> 00:22:33.582]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:22:33.882 --> 00:22:37.166]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.

[00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:46.951]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.

[00:23:28.962 --> 00:23:38.248]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, and carting to a private bank, having it lent back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:23:38.288 --> 00:23:45.233]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:23:45.353 --> 00:23:46.174]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:23:46.234 --> 00:23:49.336]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[00:23:49.496 --> 00:23:50.256]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.

[00:23:58.882 --> 00:24:01.287]  We're good to go.
[00:24:16.472 --> 00:24:17.874]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[00:24:17.994 --> 00:24:18.535]  to 2 p.m.
[00:24:18.595 --> 00:24:19.075]  Central.
[00:24:19.556 --> 00:24:20.877]  That's 12 noon to 3 p.m.
[00:24:20.958 --> 00:24:21.338]  Eastern.
[00:24:21.718 --> 00:24:23.000]  We are here live.
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:24.902]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:24:24.922 --> 00:24:30.269]  Governor Jesse Ventura coming up in about an hour here with us to cover a host of important issues.
[00:24:30.289 --> 00:24:31.270]  I'm going to get his take on
[00:24:32.071 --> 00:24:38.113]  Wienergate, the state of the economy, his lawsuit with the TSA, and so much more.
[00:24:38.133 --> 00:24:50.496]  I also want to get into the fact that they're now saying that it's not the bean sprouts, it's not the lettuce, it's not the cucumbers, it's not the tomatoes.
[00:24:51.656 --> 00:24:52.417]  Well then what is it?
[00:24:52.517 --> 00:24:56.578]  Well, we have a history of governments and Big Agra launching
[00:24:58.010 --> 00:25:02.674]  Industrial level espionage against their competition.
[00:25:03.895 --> 00:25:06.957]  And this is a genetically engineered super E. coli.
[00:25:06.977 --> 00:25:13.082]  And so I want to go back over some of the history of some of the cases where governments and others have been caught doing this.
[00:25:17.865 --> 00:25:27.032]  Now, I want to just briefly get into Weiner and then I'm going to open the phones up and we don't screen your calls here on this radio show.
[00:25:27.967 --> 00:25:30.009]  We just ask your name and where you're calling from.
[00:25:30.549 --> 00:25:35.574]  If you disagree with me, and you volunteer that information, we will put you to the head of the line.
[00:25:36.274 --> 00:25:49.265]  Not only do I not screen calls, which sometimes I think I should, just because some folks are not very articulate, or it seems like they call up when they're half asleep, and then that doesn't give the callers that really have a fire in their belly time to get on air.
[00:25:50.186 --> 00:25:52.968]  But still, I think in the spirit of
[00:25:53.869 --> 00:25:58.792]  Not screening and really having a free flow of information, we don't screen your calls.
[00:25:59.612 --> 00:26:08.437]  Except sometimes, when we have a guest on, and it's on a particular topic or subject, we say, please only call on subject.
[00:26:08.877 --> 00:26:21.063]  But because people are so accustomed to doing whatever they want, I could be talking about a Mars mission with Buzz Aldrin, and people call in and say, sorry, I want to talk about the NAFTA superhighway.
[00:26:21.443 --> 00:26:22.584]  But we have Buzz Aldrin on.
[00:26:23.663 --> 00:26:24.083]  I don't care.
[00:26:24.384 --> 00:26:26.485]  We're going to talk about Napa Superhighway, Alex.
[00:26:26.685 --> 00:26:27.666]  And then I just hang up on him.
[00:26:28.606 --> 00:26:31.228]  But I do want to hear from everybody out there.
[00:26:31.248 --> 00:26:33.330]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:33.430]  800-259-9231.
[00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:39.334]  And take a lot of phone calls here on the show if I don't get too caught up in all the news and information.
[00:26:39.374 --> 00:26:41.255]  Look, what do you say about Wiener?
[00:26:47.933 --> 00:26:59.662]  Overall, Congressman Wienergate's scandal is funny, and Congress is hated, and should be, with a 9% approval rating.
[00:27:00.283 --> 00:27:03.225]  America's really starting to wake up, and so it's good to see him falling.
[00:27:03.926 --> 00:27:13.073]  He is a vicious anti-Second Amendment, big government, pro-socialist healthcare, one-world government, loving individual.
[00:27:14.133 --> 00:27:22.099]  He also has demonized, because he's a big Wall Street minion, and Wall Street wages war, especially the big brokerage firms and banks, against real money.
[00:27:22.679 --> 00:27:27.303]  And gold and silver makes their fiat currency look bad worldwide, that they can manipulate.
[00:27:27.343 --> 00:27:28.884]  And so they're always attacking gold and silver.
[00:27:28.924 --> 00:27:32.727]  And he did that and tried to destroy some of the biggest companies out there.
[00:27:33.467 --> 00:27:41.053]  And I researched his committee hearings, and it was all a bunch of deceptive garbage.
[00:27:41.493 --> 00:27:42.394]  It was not accurate.
[00:27:43.922 --> 00:27:48.626]  I mean, it would be easy to get up here and say, oh, I don't like that other talk show host sponsor.
[00:27:48.666 --> 00:27:49.967]  We've got better deals in gold.
[00:27:51.328 --> 00:27:57.513]  And analyzing, and I think Midas does, but at the same time, I think that other company is competitive and offers some really good products.
[00:27:58.153 --> 00:28:05.259]  And the things that Wiener was saying about it when I went and researched it, and I know a lot about the gold and silver industry, were lies.
[00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:11.063]  Well, what do you expect from a guy who has openly said he wants to ban guns?
[00:28:12.064 --> 00:28:13.065]  I mean, he's a tyrant.
[00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:15.280]  And he's crazy!
[00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:25.504]  I mean, I would never, never, never send any woman, including my wife, a photograph of my genitals.
[00:28:27.224 --> 00:28:31.146]  Much less hundreds of photos the scores of women we're now learning.
[00:28:32.287 --> 00:28:33.408]  And here's the issue.
[00:28:33.908 --> 00:28:35.769]  When do these politicians lie?
[00:28:35.789 --> 00:28:36.570]  When their lips move?
[00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:39.771]  Bill Clinton, his wife works with Hillary.
[00:28:39.811 --> 00:28:40.932]  This is the big Clinton insider.
[00:28:41.292 --> 00:28:42.233]  You listen here.
[00:28:42.253 --> 00:28:43.634]  How dare you?
[00:28:43.654 --> 00:28:46.175]  I did not have sex with that woman, Monica Lewinsky.
[00:28:46.215 --> 00:28:49.977]  You hear me?
[00:28:49.997 --> 00:28:51.318]  9-11's an inside job.
[00:28:51.398 --> 00:28:53.480]  How dare you?
[00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:56.281]  How dare you?
[00:28:56.441 --> 00:28:57.322]  Rings hollow, doesn't it?
[00:28:58.069 --> 00:28:59.830]  We heard the same thing, how dare you, on Monica.
[00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:03.033]  And so this guy, a week ago, was like, Brett Bart is a liar!
[00:29:03.513 --> 00:29:06.555]  Brett Bart, you know, the big conservative blogger, needs to be fired!
[00:29:06.895 --> 00:29:08.757]  I'm coming after him, it's not true!
[00:29:09.317 --> 00:29:19.024]  I didn't, cause Brett Bart knew how to go look at the internet technology and tell that that was his account, and look at some of the history, and when he'd been active, and say, hey, I'm calling you on it.
[00:29:19.324 --> 00:29:20.225]  Brett Bart really, uh...
[00:29:21.636 --> 00:29:22.316]  He took the bait.
[00:29:23.217 --> 00:29:23.977]  That is, Wiener did.
[00:29:24.197 --> 00:29:28.959]  Turns out Brett Barth had all these other photos, and Wiener came out and lied and said that he was lying.
[00:29:29.819 --> 00:29:31.840]  And now Wiener's in deep trouble.
[00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:35.821]  He's having to admit, okay, I did send the photo, I did take it.
[00:29:36.121 --> 00:29:36.821]  Remember before?
[00:29:36.981 --> 00:29:37.722]  I was hacked!
[00:29:38.142 --> 00:29:39.262]  It's photoshopped!
[00:29:39.742 --> 00:29:40.162]  Yes!
[00:29:40.543 --> 00:29:42.023]  Yes, that's right, believe me!
[00:29:42.243 --> 00:29:45.484]  By the way, turn your guns into me, because I want you to be safe.
[00:29:45.504 --> 00:29:50.346]  It's not that I want to enslave you, because I'm a government pimp who has an instinct to disarm my quarry.
[00:29:50.546 --> 00:29:53.553]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.475 --> 00:29:57.161]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.114 --> 00:30:04.337]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:30:04.657 --> 00:30:05.258]  Number 1.
[00:30:05.578 --> 00:30:08.720]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:09.001 --> 00:30:09.561]  Number 2.
[00:30:09.861 --> 00:30:14.405]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:14.745 --> 00:30:15.185]  It's true.
[00:30:15.485 --> 00:30:20.049]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:20.369 --> 00:30:20.909]  Number 3.
[00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:24.472]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:24.772 --> 00:30:28.475]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:30:28.675 --> 00:30:29.216]  Number 4.
[00:30:29.476 --> 00:30:31.839]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:30:32.239 --> 00:30:35.623]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:35.923 --> 00:30:36.123]  Number 5.
[00:30:36.704 --> 00:30:40.628]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:30:40.849 --> 00:30:45.614]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:30:45.894 --> 00:30:49.918]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:50.058 --> 00:30:51.639]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:53.942]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:30:54.102 --> 00:30:56.444]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:31:01.021 --> 00:31:02.523]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:31:02.723 --> 00:31:07.769]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:31:08.029 --> 00:31:09.411]  Saving means to make money.
[00:31:09.571 --> 00:31:18.361]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:31:19.102 --> 00:31:26.206]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:31:26.626 --> 00:31:34.230]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:39.552]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[00:31:39.853 --> 00:31:42.034]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:31:44.795 --> 00:31:47.696]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[00:31:48.016 --> 00:31:50.317]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:31:50.377 --> 00:31:52.498]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[00:32:00.896 --> 00:32:04.500]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:07.904]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:32:08.144 --> 00:32:12.929]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:32:12.949 --> 00:32:19.216]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:32:19.336 --> 00:32:21.579]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:32:22.119 --> 00:32:22.399]  Tim Geithner?
[00:32:22.419 --> 00:32:22.639]  Bernanke?
[00:32:22.679 --> 00:32:23.219]  They're arsonists!
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:24.020]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:25.721]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:32:41.007 --> 00:32:42.848]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:32:43.128 --> 00:32:47.931]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:32:48.291 --> 00:32:58.216]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:06.760]  Big Brother.
[00:33:08.101 --> 00:33:09.241]  Mainstream Media.
[00:33:10.868 --> 00:33:14.431]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:33:15.371 --> 00:33:19.774]  We are honored that you are tuning in on
[00:33:38.407 --> 00:33:44.532]  Great stations like 810 at Blowtorch in Florida.
[00:33:44.892 --> 00:33:48.936]  They're in Orlando and so many other great affiliates across the country.
[00:33:48.976 --> 00:33:54.120]  I really need to start screening the calls to an extent to ask folks how they're calling in.
[00:33:54.961 --> 00:34:01.806]  We screen the calls to such a non-existent extent we don't even really ask what stations people are calling in on.
[00:34:02.207 --> 00:34:06.530]  I may actually change that and
[00:34:07.975 --> 00:34:21.046]  Start some bear screening, just so we can find out exactly how folks are listening, because stations have been asking us to do that for a long time, and we really should do that for all the big stations that are picking up the show.
[00:34:21.086 --> 00:34:29.913]  Plus, it's fun to hear where people are tuning in from, whether it's satellite, global shortwave, internet, or terrestrial AM and FM stations.
[00:34:30.973 --> 00:34:32.033]  Very exciting numbers.
[00:34:32.053 --> 00:34:36.995]  24,700,000 plus people listened.
[00:34:37.955 --> 00:34:44.057]  Just over one of our ways that we stream over the internet at Shoutcast alone in the month of May.
[00:34:44.257 --> 00:34:46.197]  Very, very exciting.
[00:34:46.797 --> 00:34:50.919]  And on our eight YouTube channels, we're now getting on average about 5 million views a week.
[00:34:50.939 --> 00:34:52.939]  114 million views on one of the channels alone.
[00:34:56.909 --> 00:35:00.093]  No brag, just fact, very exciting.
[00:35:00.113 --> 00:35:02.155]  But also something's happening.
[00:35:02.716 --> 00:35:10.305]  For years, I've been on air 16 years, in the last four or five years, I have zero butterflies when I get on the radio.
[00:35:10.325 --> 00:35:13.108]  And that's not a good thing because I tend to really be able to focus
[00:35:13.969 --> 00:35:23.916]  And make more key analytical connections on air when I am frosty and when I do have that feeling of standing up on the edge of a cliff.
[00:35:24.276 --> 00:35:35.844]  But now I'm having that feeling come back more and more, something I really haven't felt intensely for more than a decade, because I realize that we are reaching millions and millions and millions and millions
[00:35:36.264 --> 00:35:36.524]  I think?
[00:35:58.923 --> 00:36:04.245]  And the fact that we are getting this message out to tens of millions of people is revolutionary.
[00:36:04.305 --> 00:36:09.188]  Make no mistake, what is happening here is nothing short of awe-inspiring.
[00:36:09.788 --> 00:36:11.929]  And I just ask God to lead, guide, and direct me.
[00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:18.642]  And that I be a worthy vessel to try to expose and fight corruption.
[00:36:19.162 --> 00:36:32.967]  And I want to thank the listeners for spreading the word about the broadcast and the news websites over the years because you are the absolutely vital key ingredient and component in the explosion of the truth movement.
[00:36:33.727 --> 00:36:44.690]  Which is really a movement to question government corruption, to question the megacorporations that are waging war against the free market in a corporate takeover of the planet known as the New World Order.
[00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:49.551]  Now finishing up with Wiener and then a smattering of some other news I'll get to later if we have time.
[00:36:49.911 --> 00:36:54.132]  Obviously much of it will be covered today, but I need to at least mention it so we know we got to it.
[00:36:54.992 --> 00:36:55.472]  Some level.
[00:36:56.053 --> 00:37:02.118]  And then I want to go to Wilson, Ed, Peter, Don, Kathy and others that are patiently holding toll-free number 800-259-9231.
[00:37:02.718 --> 00:37:05.741]  The Genesis phone system only has six phone lines.
[00:37:06.201 --> 00:37:09.304]  Ours has a hundred or more.
[00:37:09.324 --> 00:37:13.367]  We can put a hundred up on the board and we can get a hundred calls in in about one minute.
[00:37:13.787 --> 00:37:14.368]  That's another thing.
[00:37:14.628 --> 00:37:17.530]  I've been in studio with national shows and they'll have like 15 phone lines.
[00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:19.792]  They're like, wow, you lit up all our lines.
[00:37:19.812 --> 00:37:23.215]  And I'm like, you think lighting up 15 lines is a big deal?
[00:37:24.656 --> 00:37:30.771]  In fact, somebody ought to put a video camera in here and show people the phone system, and you can watch a hundred calls come in in less than a minute.
[00:37:31.929 --> 00:37:33.130]  Sometimes it might take three minutes.
[00:37:34.511 --> 00:37:38.634]  And we could expand the board to where you could see probably 1,000 phone calls.
[00:37:38.714 --> 00:38:01.469]  Again, I'm not bragging here, but we have to realize that Mr. Maddow Show, excuse me, Sir Maddow on, I mean, Mrs. Maddow or Miss Maddow, whatever its name is, on MSNBC has less viewers than, and I've looked at the ratings numbers, than maybe 10 of our biggest affiliates.
[00:38:02.669 --> 00:38:09.912]  I mean, we have AM radio stations where, over the course of a show, 150,000 people tune in in big cities.
[00:38:12.792 --> 00:38:14.353]  I mean, these people are a paper tiger.
[00:38:14.413 --> 00:38:15.453]  They are an illusion.
[00:38:15.893 --> 00:38:17.614]  We have millions a day over the Internet.
[00:38:19.414 --> 00:38:20.215]  Rachel Maddow...
[00:38:21.164 --> 00:38:21.304]  Are we?
[00:38:40.831 --> 00:38:45.782]  There are morning shows in this country in major cities that have a million people that tune in.
[00:38:46.203 --> 00:38:51.093]  And to advertise on those shows is a couple hundred bucks a minute.
[00:38:52.179 --> 00:38:56.982]  But then they have more listeners, many big city radio shows, than MSNBC.
[00:38:57.002 --> 00:39:00.005]  You know how much MSNBC is for a one-minute ad during prime time?
[00:39:00.425 --> 00:39:02.806]  Ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty thousand dollars.
[00:39:03.647 --> 00:39:04.888]  It's a paper tiger.
[00:39:05.268 --> 00:39:06.149]  It's a hoax.
[00:39:06.589 --> 00:39:07.550]  It's an illusion.
[00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:10.852]  The government is a discredited group of criminals.
[00:39:11.713 --> 00:39:17.277]  MSNBC got government secret bailout and private Federal Reserve money, your tax money.
[00:39:17.577 --> 00:39:18.518]  They're a joke!
[00:39:19.577 --> 00:39:23.722]  And Congress ruled back under Bush that the buying of news by government is illegal.
[00:39:24.082 --> 00:39:24.823]  It's illegal!
[00:39:25.644 --> 00:39:39.219]  It's illegal in Florida when Bank of America got caught taking a house six months ago, well, five months ago they were ordered in court to give the money back and the house back, that they never had a deed to, they never owned, that was paid for in cash.
[00:39:40.276 --> 00:39:41.517]  In a different transaction.
[00:39:41.937 --> 00:39:45.038]  And finally the court said, we're seizing your Bank of America branch.
[00:39:45.579 --> 00:39:49.881]  It's time to recognize how pathetic and weak these people are.
[00:39:50.181 --> 00:40:05.489]  They want a police state in place because they're losing control and the system knows they've committed legions of crimes and if they don't have martial law in this country and if they don't put in the internet kill switch and if they don't shut us down, they're going to lose!
[00:40:07.999 --> 00:40:10.641]  91% of the American people hate the Congress.
[00:40:12.542 --> 00:40:13.743]  The people are awake.
[00:40:14.424 --> 00:40:17.146]  We just haven't realized that they are awake yet.
[00:40:17.186 --> 00:40:19.187]  That's the last domino to fall.
[00:40:19.588 --> 00:40:23.831]  They don't want us to get together and realize that we're winning the info war.
[00:40:23.911 --> 00:40:24.672]  Okay, I'm ranting.
[00:40:25.892 --> 00:40:26.313]  I'm ranting.
[00:40:26.573 --> 00:40:28.815]  Look at the type of news I have before I finish up with Weiner.
[00:40:30.035 --> 00:40:30.576]  Weiner Gate.
[00:40:31.196 --> 00:40:32.958]  Or Weiner's Gate, he sent out so many photos.
[00:40:33.839 --> 00:40:36.942]  British royalty dined on human flesh, Daily Mail.
[00:40:37.102 --> 00:40:39.285]  Now, I already knew this, and I told you this years ago.
[00:40:39.625 --> 00:40:40.846]  It's in mainline history books.
[00:40:41.487 --> 00:40:45.191]  They also have their hind ends wiped, currently, by a lord.
[00:40:45.892 --> 00:40:46.632]  You think I'm joking.
[00:40:46.672 --> 00:40:47.473]  It's called Rim of the Stool.
[00:40:47.493 --> 00:40:48.815]  Folks, you cannot make this up.
[00:40:49.983 --> 00:40:52.844]  Royalty in Europe routinely ate baby flesh.
[00:40:53.064 --> 00:40:55.806]  Women believe that it made them more beautiful to eat babies.
[00:40:55.986 --> 00:40:57.987]  You know, the communist Chinese eat aborted babies.
[00:40:58.687 --> 00:41:00.648]  That was a rumor decades ago, now confirmed.
[00:41:01.728 --> 00:41:06.671]  The mobile execution vans were in the foreign press, not admitted here until about seven years ago.
[00:41:06.711 --> 00:41:09.912]  They have 25 mobile execution vans per major city.
[00:41:11.513 --> 00:41:13.494]  Again, you can't make up how evil government is.
[00:41:13.874 --> 00:41:15.615]  British royalty dine on human flesh.
[00:41:16.650 --> 00:41:19.972]  They have long been famed for their love of lavish banquets and rich recipes.
[00:41:20.412 --> 00:41:23.493]  But what is less well known is the British Royals also had a taste for human flesh.
[00:41:23.854 --> 00:41:25.034]  They're predators.
[00:41:25.454 --> 00:41:29.737]  They funded, 156 years ago, the eugenics movement.
[00:41:29.997 --> 00:41:39.482]  They openly commissioned the Royal Institutes over there to set up a system to enslave and exterminate the population.
[00:41:39.802 --> 00:41:41.963]  Now, Hitler, that's why the British King,
[00:41:42.543 --> 00:41:48.828]  Edward VIII was a Nazi and that's why he had to step down was because there was a shift against the Nazis.
[00:41:49.488 --> 00:41:50.949]  They founded the Bilderberg Group.
[00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:57.034]  They are the ones that openly fund in public commissions in England and the US.
[00:41:58.237 --> 00:42:01.019]  Engineering rice and corn to sterilize you.
[00:42:01.059 --> 00:42:02.740]  By the way, I have the documents right here.
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:05.401]  The Rockefeller documents, 1963.
[00:42:05.741 --> 00:42:07.802]  We've written articles with links to their own websites.
[00:42:07.822 --> 00:42:08.483]  They're proud of this.
[00:42:09.063 --> 00:42:09.704]  I have the U.S.
[00:42:09.724 --> 00:42:11.585]  Department of Agriculture funds.
[00:42:11.625 --> 00:42:12.825]  Just type in the search engine, U.S.
[00:42:12.845 --> 00:42:17.588]  Department of Agriculture funds corn crops that sterilize you.
[00:42:17.708 --> 00:42:19.369]  And you will get links to them.
[00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:21.850]  Oh, but they wouldn't hurt us.
[00:42:22.471 --> 00:42:22.971]  I'm sorry.
[00:42:23.211 --> 00:42:25.913]  Let's go back to the
[00:42:28.922 --> 00:42:39.770]  Cannibalism, the report has revealed, as that recently as the 18th century, uh, no, this didn't stop, uh, British royalty swallowed parts of the human body.
[00:42:40.071 --> 00:42:46.015]  The author adds that this was, uh, not a practice reserved to monarchs, but was widespread among the well-to-do in Europe.
[00:42:46.535 --> 00:42:48.377]  They've always been predators.
[00:42:48.757 --> 00:42:49.958]  They see you as animals.
[00:42:49.978 --> 00:42:52.060]  See, let me explain how this works, okay?
[00:42:53.741 --> 00:42:54.662]  Let me explain how this works.
[00:42:56.479 --> 00:43:10.687]  If you're a new listener and you hear me say that DynCorp and Halliburton have, it's been admitted in congressional hearings and major newspapers in the country, are running giant white slavery rings, including women and children.
[00:43:13.109 --> 00:43:14.270]  That means sex slavery.
[00:43:14.290 --> 00:43:16.411]  I always get emails saying, well, don't you care about black slavery?
[00:43:16.471 --> 00:43:17.812]  White slavery is sexual slavery.
[00:43:19.301 --> 00:43:21.384]  It's like white ops, black ops.
[00:43:22.025 --> 00:43:22.566]  It's a name.
[00:43:22.606 --> 00:43:23.488]  Nothing to do with black people.
[00:43:23.949 --> 00:43:25.972]  People can't even think in this country because of political correctness.
[00:43:25.992 --> 00:43:27.174]  Oh, you don't want Socialist Healthcare?
[00:43:27.194 --> 00:43:27.715]  You're a racist.
[00:43:27.935 --> 00:43:29.137]  You're like, what does that have to do with reality?
[00:43:29.317 --> 00:43:29.758]  We don't care.
[00:43:29.778 --> 00:43:30.639]  We're brainwashed idiots.
[00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:31.421]  Side issue.
[00:43:33.883 --> 00:43:35.164]  Let me explain how this works.
[00:43:35.825 --> 00:43:47.213]  I've been talking about DynCorp and Halliburton and other globalist defense contractors and the UN for 16 years running white slavery worldwide because it's in the BBC.
[00:43:47.593 --> 00:43:48.834]  It's in the Associated Press.
[00:43:49.154 --> 00:43:52.056]  It just doesn't become the big nightly news item.
[00:43:53.417 --> 00:43:55.939]  So, yes, I have been driven crazy
[00:43:56.929 --> 00:44:14.580]  To a certain extent, by knowing this evil is going on, knowing that the royals drink blood, knowing that Al Gore, it came out in major news back in 99, flies around with a refrigerator full of blood of different blood types.
[00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:17.542]  They say, well, it's in case he gets shot, he has blood with him.
[00:44:17.582 --> 00:44:19.063]  Well, it's a bunch of different blood types.
[00:44:19.963 --> 00:44:23.786]  I know that the royalty has people that wipe their hind ends.
[00:44:24.827 --> 00:44:28.532]  And it's actually on the record, but people can't believe reality.
[00:44:28.992 --> 00:44:34.340]  I know that there is a practice in Europe, still ongoing, and a practice by the Communist Chinese.
[00:44:34.921 --> 00:44:37.344]  Elites have always eaten man flesh.
[00:44:38.706 --> 00:44:39.467]  That's why they...
[00:44:40.578 --> 00:44:41.598]  Believe they're the elites.
[00:44:42.118 --> 00:45:06.725]  If you go back to the Aztecs, the number one way, and this is on record, mainline anthropology, archaeology, the main way the priest class that ruled the Mesoamerican cultures, Toltec, others, up to the Mayan, Aztec, the whole Mayan culture, the daily sacrifices for sunrise, for noon, for the sun setting on big holidays, they would sacrifice more than 10,000 per sacrificial city.
[00:45:07.026 --> 00:45:07.886]  I've been to many of them.
[00:45:08.746 --> 00:45:13.549]  The main way they funded the priest class was the longhands.
[00:45:15.190 --> 00:45:25.596]  And they would, the highest price was child meat, and they would have the daily sacrifices, and the lower priest, it would sell beneath the pyramid, in the market, the human flesh.
[00:45:27.277 --> 00:45:30.519]  Now, every culture does this.
[00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:40.543]  This is what happens, and image it as a centrifuge, where they spin out the different parts.
[00:45:41.524 --> 00:45:42.084]  Here's the analogy.
[00:45:42.124 --> 00:45:42.724]  Take blood.
[00:45:43.205 --> 00:45:56.590]  They put blood in the centrifuge and they spin it, and the heavier platelets get on the outside, and the dead blood cells, and then the blood cells, and then the plasma that has the white blood cells on on the outside.
[00:45:57.371 --> 00:45:59.111]  And that's basically what society does.
[00:46:01.493 --> 00:46:05.216]  In history, there's always psychopaths on average for every 200 people.
[00:46:05.416 --> 00:46:06.277]  There's one psychopath.
[00:46:06.957 --> 00:46:10.640]  For every 25 to 30, depends on what statistic you look at, you have a sociopath.
[00:46:11.921 --> 00:46:20.408]  And the psychopaths always, in society, want the power, want the control, want to chain people down and eat them.
[00:46:21.289 --> 00:46:21.969]  It's what they like.
[00:46:22.450 --> 00:46:24.411]  They are malfunctioning.
[00:46:24.451 --> 00:46:25.352]  They are mentally ill.
[00:46:25.572 --> 00:46:26.873]  There's something wrong with them.
[00:46:27.394 --> 00:46:29.796]  They're predators against their own species, okay?
[00:46:32.298 --> 00:46:37.159]  They always recruit the sociopaths, people that just don't care and only care about themselves.
[00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:56.085]  They don't so much enjoy killing people, or ripping children's teeth out with pliers, or burning people's eyes out with hot pokers, or boiling people in oil, or crucifying people upside down, or murdering entire cities, or lining a thousand mile Roman road with people burning at the stake.
[00:46:56.905 --> 00:46:58.926]  But they'll do it if they get the power.
[00:47:00.489 --> 00:47:02.370]  They just want a big house and, you know, women.
[00:47:03.992 --> 00:47:17.702]  And they always get into power in every case, and that's why the norm, not the exception, is torture dungeons, mass executions, mass raping, slavery, death and destruction.
[00:47:19.023 --> 00:47:22.986]  And that's why I call the Queen of England a disgusting demon.
[00:47:23.887 --> 00:47:25.508]  That's why I pull her down.
[00:47:25.988 --> 00:47:27.349]  We're told she's this sweet old lady.
[00:47:27.730 --> 00:47:28.951]  She is the progeny
[00:47:29.818 --> 00:47:30.199]  of course.
[00:47:48.772 --> 00:48:00.239]  And it's a secret process they reportedly still engage in, but as early as just 60, 70 years ago, it was on record that they would bathe women, especially in the blood of children.
[00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:03.561]  This is one of their favorite things to do.
[00:48:03.901 --> 00:48:05.302]  And so all elites do this.
[00:48:05.342 --> 00:48:06.362]  They believe it makes them beautiful.
[00:48:07.503 --> 00:48:11.886]  And they will slit the child's throat right there at the bathtub, pour it in.
[00:48:12.566 --> 00:48:15.688]  These women find it beautiful to watch the child's blood spraying out.
[00:48:15.948 --> 00:48:17.049]  Then they get in the bloodbath.
[00:48:18.086 --> 00:48:18.346]  Okay.
[00:48:18.426 --> 00:48:19.107]  Now, see, I don't know.
[00:48:19.127 --> 00:48:21.068]  I never really even got that far on air.
[00:48:21.369 --> 00:48:27.353]  I just thought since it's mainstream news right now, British royalty dined on human flesh, I thought I would just bring that up to you.
[00:48:27.393 --> 00:48:30.016]  But not so much even the dining on the human flesh.
[00:48:30.716 --> 00:48:35.200]  They like to split the head open and get the pituitary gland and eat it.
[00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:37.600]  It's the old-fashioned growth hormone.
[00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:48.823]  You know, the rich people today spend millions of dollars getting the scores of facelifts, and Botox, and liposuction, and blood transfusions.
[00:48:49.423 --> 00:48:51.523]  Yeah, but that's for the lower-level nouveau riche.
[00:48:52.284 --> 00:48:56.965]  The British royalty, they like to eat the pituitary gland.
[00:48:57.145 --> 00:48:58.865]  And it goes on in the article that it was medical.
[00:48:58.925 --> 00:48:59.845]  It was so they'd live longer.
[00:49:01.125 --> 00:49:02.906]  But they also enjoyed the dishes.
[00:49:05.154 --> 00:49:06.295]  Medical cannibalism.
[00:49:06.695 --> 00:49:16.660]  Both Queen Mary II and her uncle, King Charles II, both took distilled human skull on their deathbeds in 1698 and 1685.
[00:49:18.601 --> 00:49:22.223]  But again, they did this as late as even 100 years after.
[00:49:22.863 --> 00:49:26.685]  Cannibalism was not only found in the New World, as is often believed, but also in Europe.
[00:49:27.385 --> 00:49:30.047]  Well, of course it was found in
[00:49:33.962 --> 00:49:34.522]  Europe as well.
[00:49:34.822 --> 00:49:37.063]  Every culture has psychopaths.
[00:49:37.704 --> 00:49:41.906]  Every culture has decadent people that always want to do something new.
[00:49:42.626 --> 00:49:49.209]  Always want to satiate themselves with something more bizarre, more insane, more disgusting.
[00:49:49.669 --> 00:49:57.772]  Remember the case in New York with the Rolling Stones and the black kids sacrificing the voodoo ritual, but so many high-powered people were there that they didn't even get in trouble?
[00:49:58.493 --> 00:50:00.914]  You think movies like Eyes Wide Shut are fiction?
[00:50:02.728 --> 00:50:10.615]  No, ladies and gentlemen, Kubrick died after he refused, mysteriously died, after he refused to cut out 25 minutes of that film.
[00:50:10.876 --> 00:50:11.977]  He died, they cut it.
[00:50:12.837 --> 00:50:13.798]  And what do you have in that movie?
[00:50:14.038 --> 00:50:21.285]  The wealthy elite of New York going to a palace mansion and having orgies and human sacrifice.
[00:50:22.066 --> 00:50:23.267]  Well, this is what they do.
[00:50:23.727 --> 00:50:25.049]  I've been to Bohemian Grove.
[00:50:26.129 --> 00:50:32.351]  Okay, I just saw the opening ritual, which is a mock human sacrifice, which is an outward image of what is privately done.
[00:50:33.532 --> 00:50:34.712]  What do they do at Skull and Bones?
[00:50:34.772 --> 00:50:35.492]  ABC News.
[00:50:36.193 --> 00:50:37.033]  Was caught on video.
[00:50:37.513 --> 00:50:38.633]  Worshipping Satan.
[00:50:38.674 --> 00:50:41.014]  Doing, quote, mock human sacrifice.
[00:50:41.635 --> 00:50:45.696]  That's where the elites just put their kids in these things and see which ones like it.
[00:50:45.916 --> 00:50:47.417]  They go, you like doing the mock thing?
[00:50:48.077 --> 00:50:51.798]  You know, you've, uh, you've, you've, you've trained now in Little League.
[00:50:52.418 --> 00:50:53.599]  Now we're gonna move you up.
[00:50:54.653 --> 00:50:56.413]  From softball to hardball.
[00:50:56.773 --> 00:50:58.594]  Okay, I said I'd get to your calls and I'll get to it.
[00:50:58.934 --> 00:51:00.654]  The point is the wiener stuff's nothing compared to this.
[00:51:00.674 --> 00:51:01.735]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:51:01.795 --> 00:51:07.136]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:51:07.376 --> 00:51:11.997]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:51:12.397 --> 00:51:12.797]  It's true.
[00:51:12.877 --> 00:51:15.437]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[00:51:15.678 --> 00:51:17.418]  And it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:51:17.958 --> 00:51:22.661]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:51:23.182 --> 00:51:25.123]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:51:25.503 --> 00:51:30.106]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.

[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:56.821]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:51:57.142 --> 00:51:59.582]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

[00:53:49.444 --> 00:53:50.725]  Strange days have found
[00:54:17.993 --> 00:54:25.715]  If you just type into a search engine, queen who bathed in blood, you'll get Elizabeth Bathory.
[00:54:27.736 --> 00:54:36.638]  She would have the court kidnap young maidens and she thought for her beauty and she would bathe in their blood.
[00:54:36.658 --> 00:54:39.819]  A countess.
[00:54:42.039 --> 00:54:43.440]  Wasn't she in Transylvania?
[00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:44.260]  That's where one of the
[00:54:45.421 --> 00:54:47.643]  That's where one of the vampire legends come from.
[00:54:48.043 --> 00:54:50.585]  See, all of these legends come from real places.
[00:54:51.066 --> 00:54:53.828]  These people aren't physical, real vampires.
[00:54:54.528 --> 00:54:56.050]  They're mentally ill.
[00:54:56.070 --> 00:55:11.122]  And of course, the ancient Greeks dealt with, quote, vampires, and they even had vampire hunting parties, going around looking for the insane people that would hide out in caves during the day and come out and kidnap people during the night.
[00:55:11.422 --> 00:55:12.783]  In fact, what's the psychological
[00:55:13.643 --> 00:55:17.344]  I'm going to do a whole video on this and pull up all the data, you know, just going from memory.
[00:55:18.344 --> 00:55:24.305]  There's a psychological term, vampirism, where these mentally ill people think they're vampires.
[00:55:24.345 --> 00:55:25.646]  Let me just put that in here right.
[00:55:26.206 --> 00:55:27.006]  Vampirism.
[00:55:29.407 --> 00:55:31.507]  Vampirism.
[00:55:32.247 --> 00:55:32.727]  There you go.
[00:55:32.747 --> 00:55:35.168]  Yep, is a sickness.
[00:55:36.108 --> 00:55:37.688]  And it goes over it.
[00:55:37.708 --> 00:55:40.209]  Yeah, here it is in the encyclopedia.
[00:55:43.243 --> 00:55:45.185]  It's just vampirism has existed for millennia.
[00:55:45.225 --> 00:55:53.755]  Cultures such as the Mesopotamians, Hebrews, ancient Greeks and Romans had to deal with people running around thinking they were vampires.
[00:55:54.595 --> 00:55:56.157]  And we know who these folks are.
[00:55:56.217 --> 00:55:58.780]  See, it's not that they're smarter or even better than us.
[00:55:59.321 --> 00:56:02.905]  It's that they're willing to do things that normal people wouldn't do.
[00:56:03.385 --> 00:56:08.927]  They're very sick, they're very degenerate, they're very mentally ill, and they lust for power and control.
[00:56:09.347 --> 00:56:11.427]  They think war and death is beautiful.
[00:56:11.887 --> 00:56:22.750]  And they're trying to now sell the general public on death and torture and murder and sadomasochism to turn our civilization into something that resembles the world they want.
[00:56:23.030 --> 00:56:25.271]  They want to bring all this out in the open.
[00:56:26.069 --> 00:56:30.452]  And that's what all the Lady Gaga vampirism and all that's about for our young girls.
[00:56:30.753 --> 00:56:34.195]  That's what the record suicides are about, and little girls cutting themselves up.
[00:56:34.756 --> 00:56:40.380]  Parents just turn themselves over to absolute, total evil.
[00:56:42.822 --> 00:56:48.106]  And I now have been ranting, and I promise to get to your calls when we start the next hour.
[00:56:48.726 --> 00:56:50.508]  And I will go to all of them.
[00:56:50.828 --> 00:56:51.929]  See, that's the problem.
[00:56:52.509 --> 00:56:54.771]  Every one of these articles is off-the-chart important.
[00:56:57.063 --> 00:56:58.724]  And, I mean, look at this.
[00:56:59.925 --> 00:57:06.010]  Japan confirms total meltdown of three of the six reactors, partial meltdown of two.
[00:57:06.310 --> 00:57:08.231]  So meltdown at five, total meltdown at three.
[00:57:08.811 --> 00:57:16.177]  I told you that two months ago, and we had the experts on, and I got emails saying, oh man, you're exaggerating.
[00:57:16.677 --> 00:57:20.240]  I've studied nuclear engineering as a layman.
[00:57:20.260 --> 00:57:22.221]  I've interviewed top nuclear physicists.
[00:57:22.321 --> 00:57:26.024]  I've looked at other cases, and when you see,
[00:57:27.540 --> 00:57:27.840]  I don't
[00:57:43.442 --> 00:57:51.526]  Atomic mini-explosions have been confirmed by German, Russian, and British scientists, like Dr. Busby and others we've had on.
[00:57:51.966 --> 00:57:57.029]  I mean, they have the isotopes, and it's 100% from laboratory experiments in reactors.
[00:57:57.289 --> 00:58:02.231]  They know, well, when you have this isotope number, you know they've had atomic explosions.
[00:58:02.792 --> 00:58:04.112]  Mini-explosions there.
[00:58:04.473 --> 00:58:07.734]  What do you think shoots fuel rods 3,000 plus feet in the air?
[00:58:08.074 --> 00:58:09.295]  Not steam.
[00:58:09.675 --> 00:58:10.916]  Not a hydrogen explosion.
[00:58:12.008 --> 00:58:14.568]  But hey, I don't have to sit here and convince you anymore.
[00:58:15.009 --> 00:58:22.890]  CNN, Japanese government admits total meltdown, total explosion, Chernobyl at three of them.
[00:58:23.130 --> 00:58:24.290]  And they knew back then.
[00:58:25.610 --> 00:58:30.771]  See, told you again, right again, because I'm not spending my time focused on baloney.
[00:58:30.911 --> 00:58:34.332]  I am obsessed with knowledge and data and information.
[00:58:34.672 --> 00:58:39.133]  And that's why I know the people that run this planet like to kidnap little kids and drink their blood.
[00:58:43.837 --> 00:58:47.808]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

[00:59:53.147 --> 00:59:55.090]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.551 --> 00:59:58.316]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:04.966 --> 01:00:09.131]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.792 --> 01:00:10.593]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.394 --> 01:00:12.315]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.936 --> 01:00:16.561]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.121 --> 01:00:21.186]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:31.388 --> 01:00:35.892]  Okay, we're opening the phones up for the next 30 minutes until Jesse Ventura joins us, then we'll continue with phone calls.
[01:00:36.913 --> 01:00:48.502]  I want to get into this E. coli situation and the history of our government and other governments engineering sterilants into the GMO crops, and the British got caught launching the weaponized foot-and-mouth.
[01:00:49.383 --> 01:00:54.386]  What was it now, 11 years ago, to shut down family farms and sheep farms and ranches and things?
[01:00:54.606 --> 01:00:56.047]  They don't call them ranches, but that's what they are.
[01:00:56.647 --> 01:00:57.407]  That's coming up.
[01:00:58.468 --> 01:01:00.169]  I've got a bunch of other news here.
[01:01:00.249 --> 01:01:05.132]  Ten tipping points which could potentially plunge the world into a horrific economic nightmare.
[01:01:05.152 --> 01:01:06.332]  We're already plunging into it.
[01:01:06.352 --> 01:01:07.353]  We just haven't hit bottom yet.
[01:01:08.193 --> 01:01:09.534]  We've got all of that coming up.
[01:01:10.395 --> 01:01:14.297]  I've got a bunch of news, but I want to go to your phone calls, because I like to rant, folks.
[01:01:15.057 --> 01:01:17.118]  And I said I want to get to those, so we're going to do that right now.
[01:01:17.479 --> 01:01:20.841]  Wilson in Florida, thanks for holding, and Ed, Peter, Don, and Kathy.
[01:01:20.861 --> 01:01:21.922]  How are you listening, Wilson?
[01:01:23.162 --> 01:01:23.983]  I'm listening good.
[01:01:24.083 --> 01:01:27.665]  I actually called in from a number that you used to have on your website.
[01:01:28.466 --> 01:01:30.928]  You're listening over the free phone system.
[01:01:30.968 --> 01:01:31.308]  Go ahead.
[01:01:32.108 --> 01:01:32.349]  Yeah.
[01:01:33.089 --> 01:01:38.893]  And I just have two questions, one political and one personal, about my marriage to see what you think.
[01:01:38.953 --> 01:01:43.336]  The first one is, I've seen a documentary about Che Guevara.
[01:01:43.979 --> 01:01:45.060]  And it was pretty interesting.
[01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:46.442]  It was from IFC, I think.
[01:01:47.263 --> 01:01:50.206]  And I just feel like he was very inspirational.
[01:01:50.286 --> 01:01:52.628]  I'm not sure about all the history about him.
[01:01:53.309 --> 01:02:00.376]  And I just think from what he wanted people to be educated and to have hospitals and stuff.
[01:02:00.637 --> 01:02:01.758]  I just thought that was good about him.
[01:02:01.798 --> 01:02:04.381]  I want to see how you've seen him in history.
[01:02:05.526 --> 01:02:09.309]  Well, that's obviously propaganda about Che Guevara.
[01:02:09.429 --> 01:02:22.597]  Che Guevara, you can pull up the quotes, basically called other Latin Americans, he kind of had that Spanish-style elitism that the Indian populations were stupid, and that's not been what I've found.
[01:02:22.617 --> 01:02:27.300]  He talked about wiping out and killing whole groups of people that wouldn't join communism.
[01:02:28.221 --> 01:02:29.362]  They glorify him.
[01:02:29.562 --> 01:02:30.883]  Look, here's how the globalists operate.
[01:02:31.403 --> 01:02:34.667]  They create the narrative of the opposition.
[01:02:34.728 --> 01:02:45.242]  The bankers create communism as the narrative of how you're supposed to oppose them, when meanwhile on record they created it, they fund it, the Ford Foundation funds it at every level.
[01:02:45.382 --> 01:02:47.184]  Just like the globalists created Al-Qaeda.
[01:02:47.825 --> 01:02:58.372]  And then create the narrative and put out the call with their operatives to have mass shootings at shopping malls, and then some real patsies might pick up that call and actually do it.
[01:02:59.793 --> 01:03:06.357]  I mean, if you got on air and told people to go jump off a certain building at a certain time, there'd be nuts that tried to do it.
[01:03:06.838 --> 01:03:14.823]  Well, that's basically what they're doing there, but I've done deep research on Che Guevara, and he was bad news.
[01:03:18.049 --> 01:03:23.395]  But I know they glorify him and build him up and put movies out about how great he is.
[01:03:25.016 --> 01:03:27.819]  But I just do not like Che Guevara.
[01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:29.821]  But I know they sell him like he's a great guy.
[01:03:30.282 --> 01:03:30.983]  You got another question?
[01:03:32.208 --> 01:03:39.534]  Oh yeah, thanks for filling me in on that, because I really was kind of happy with some of the things I heard him say, but now I've got to really go the extra mile and finish it up.
[01:03:39.574 --> 01:03:40.674]  I've been waiting to see how you guys come up.
[01:03:40.694 --> 01:03:41.335]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:03:41.395 --> 01:03:45.218]  It sounds great to build everybody hospitals, but that never gets delivered.
[01:03:45.518 --> 01:03:55.846]  Anytime some group says, collectivize your wealth, we're going to give it back to you, it's always some foreign kingpin funding that to take control of the society.
[01:03:57.168 --> 01:04:05.453]  Government cannot be trusted, or corporate governance, that we're now going under, that's what world government is, cannot be trusted.
[01:04:05.473 --> 01:04:16.060]  Alright, and my other question was, I've been married for two years and four months, and I'm having trouble with my marriage.
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:18.822]  I have advice for my mother and father.
[01:04:18.862 --> 01:04:22.044]  I just want to see, because you know you believe in the American picture.
[01:04:22.924 --> 01:04:25.246]  My wife, she's cheated on me, and
[01:04:26.064 --> 01:04:31.330]  She's now telling me I was thinking about going on my own to focus tonight because I've been for a long time.
[01:04:31.350 --> 01:04:32.371]  Do you have children with her?
[01:04:32.391 --> 01:04:34.493]  Yes, I have a daughter.
[01:04:35.543 --> 01:04:40.026]  Well, you need to not cheat back on her because she's cheating on you.
[01:04:40.547 --> 01:04:42.088]  You need to try to get her into a good church.
[01:04:42.628 --> 01:04:44.350]  You need to try to stay together for those children.
[01:04:47.512 --> 01:04:56.258]  But you need to get your wife to stop watching television and the culture that sells her, she's not going to be fulfilled unless she cheats on you.
[01:04:56.979 --> 01:04:58.680]  But for the children, I would try to stay together.
[01:04:58.700 --> 01:04:59.201]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:01.328 --> 01:05:02.830]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:03.050 --> 01:05:08.076]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.

[01:05:19.409 --> 01:05:26.514]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:05:26.954 --> 01:05:34.559]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:05:34.959 --> 01:05:39.883]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[01:06:00.831 --> 01:06:15.304]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:06:16.305 --> 01:06:19.989]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:20.990 --> 01:06:33.002]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:06:33.762 --> 01:06:41.029]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:06:41.710 --> 01:06:51.313]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[01:06:52.073 --> 01:06:55.335]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[01:06:55.995 --> 01:06:59.116]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[01:06:59.696 --> 01:07:03.938]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:07:04.238 --> 01:07:04.518]  Number 1.
[01:07:05.158 --> 01:07:08.299]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:08.579 --> 01:07:09.139]  Number 2.
[01:07:09.439 --> 01:07:14.001]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:07:14.341 --> 01:07:14.781]  It's true.
[01:07:15.081 --> 01:07:19.643]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:07:19.943 --> 01:07:20.483]  Number 3.
[01:07:20.783 --> 01:07:24.065]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:07:24.365 --> 01:07:28.066]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:07:28.266 --> 01:07:28.807]  Number 4.
[01:07:29.067 --> 01:07:31.429]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:07:31.829 --> 01:07:35.212]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:07:35.512 --> 01:07:35.713]  Number 5.
[01:07:36.293 --> 01:07:40.216]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:07:40.437 --> 01:07:45.201]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:07:45.481 --> 01:07:49.522]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:49.662 --> 01:07:51.223]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:51.443 --> 01:07:53.524]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:07:53.704 --> 01:07:56.164]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:07:56.204 --> 01:07:57.385]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:07:57.405 --> 01:07:58.505]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:08.550 --> 01:08:26.863]  Coming up in about 25 minutes, former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura joins us to talk about a host of issues and his new best-selling book, 63 Documents the Government Doesn't Want You to Read that we, by the way, sell at our online video bookstore at infowars.com so you can get it there and support the broadcast if that's what you believe in.
[01:08:26.883 --> 01:08:29.805]  I want to go back to your calls, but here's some of the other news.
[01:08:30.326 --> 01:08:35.930]  Study finds global warming over past four centuries was due to increased solar activity.
[01:08:36.630 --> 01:08:50.045]  And that's how the peer-reviewed prestigious Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics finds global warming of the 20th century, that stopped 15 years ago, was not significantly different from warning episodes that occurred in earlier centuries.
[01:08:50.705 --> 01:08:56.231]  The paper finds the increase in solar activity in a cycle of the past 400 years explains the warming.
[01:08:56.792 --> 01:08:58.934]  Yeah, in 1600, 1700, it was freezing.
[01:08:59.414 --> 01:09:03.658]  Without any need to search for a unique case of 20th century warming.
[01:09:04.019 --> 01:09:06.941]  And they go through all of their unbelievable research on that.
[01:09:07.301 --> 01:09:08.903]  And there's thousands of other major studies.
[01:09:08.923 --> 01:09:10.644]  They've got the ice cores, the mud cores.
[01:09:11.325 --> 01:09:11.725]  They know.
[01:09:11.745 --> 01:09:16.169]  That's why we had the Iberian Maxim 9,000 years ago to start the Bronze Age.
[01:09:16.710 --> 01:09:19.793]  When the Ice Age ended, man had nothing to do with that.
[01:09:20.053 --> 01:09:21.674]  But remember two years ago at Copenhagen?
[01:09:21.694 --> 01:09:22.895]  The UN had a finding.
[01:09:23.556 --> 01:09:30.981]  And said, we voted and we've decided to say that the sun does not affect climate.
[01:09:31.822 --> 01:09:32.342]  Oh, don't believe me?
[01:09:32.362 --> 01:09:37.265]  Just type in, Copenhagen, UN votes, finds that sun does not affect climate.
[01:09:37.626 --> 01:09:38.806]  Ladies and gentlemen, the sun
[01:09:39.667 --> 01:09:41.148]  It runs and drives the climate.
[01:09:41.248 --> 01:09:52.138]  The moon manipulates climate as well, blocking solar winds, or not blocking them, depending on where it's at, and it controls the tidal forces of 76% of the Earth's surface water.
[01:09:52.518 --> 01:09:53.099]  It's a fact.
[01:09:53.619 --> 01:10:01.006]  For someone to tell you the sun and the moon does not affect climate is like saying oxygen is not what humans breathe.
[01:10:01.906 --> 01:10:05.349]  I mean, it is insanely obvious and ridiculous.
[01:10:06.355 --> 01:10:13.818]  By the way, there's a big article in the Australian newspaper saying, brand or tattoo those of us that are climate deniers.
[01:10:13.858 --> 01:10:18.120]  First it was global freezing deniers, then global warming deniers, now climate change deniers!
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:20.140]  We don't deny climate changes!
[01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:22.421]  The only thing that stays the same is change!
[01:10:22.441 --> 01:10:23.141]  Alright, I'm sorry.
[01:10:23.562 --> 01:10:23.962]  I'm sorry.
[01:10:25.082 --> 01:10:29.204]  Getting back to Wiener briefly, Congressman Wiener,
[01:10:30.933 --> 01:10:32.755]  That guy is just such a piece of work.
[01:10:32.915 --> 01:10:43.785]  Anti-gun, pro-global carbon tax, anti-family, pro-abortion, pro-world government, pro-banker bailout, lying and saying somebody hacked him, it wasn't his photo, that it might be my photo.
[01:10:44.045 --> 01:10:49.531]  Now hundreds of photos, going after media people like Brett Barth who are willing to expose him.
[01:10:51.590 --> 01:10:54.792]  It's incredible that he would get up there and say, it's not true, I didn't do it.
[01:10:55.272 --> 01:10:56.953]  And then now he's caught, of course, lying.
[01:10:57.253 --> 01:10:58.394]  And he hasn't stepped down.
[01:10:58.414 --> 01:11:00.055]  But there's a larger issue.
[01:11:00.115 --> 01:11:01.196]  Why are we going after Wiener?
[01:11:02.506 --> 01:11:09.290]  Well, because the system, Republicans are involved in all of the big banker bailouts and major corruption, most of them with the Democrats.
[01:11:09.330 --> 01:11:10.871]  They don't want to go out for people for real issues.
[01:11:11.451 --> 01:11:18.896]  $27 trillion missing, Henry Paulson getting $214 million of his own bailout money to his own bank account that he ordered.
[01:11:19.016 --> 01:11:19.917]  I mean, that's incredible.
[01:11:20.357 --> 01:11:22.638]  Conflict of interest, times a million.
[01:11:23.579 --> 01:11:25.320]  Just endless corruption.
[01:11:25.660 --> 01:11:27.181]  Major banks caught laundering $370
[01:11:29.497 --> 01:11:30.878]  Six billion dollars.
[01:11:30.938 --> 01:11:35.722]  Wachovia and its parent company, Wells Fargo, didn't get in trouble for that.
[01:11:36.242 --> 01:11:38.824]  On record, leasing and running the aircraft, flying it.
[01:11:39.084 --> 01:11:39.844]  Don't get in trouble.
[01:11:40.605 --> 01:11:43.527]  But, Wiener, they may open a criminal investigation.
[01:11:43.567 --> 01:11:44.528]  We've seen John Edwards.
[01:11:44.548 --> 01:11:45.048]  Don't like him.
[01:11:45.068 --> 01:11:46.930]  Bilderberg Group attendee.
[01:11:47.850 --> 01:11:48.411]  Don't like him.
[01:11:49.131 --> 01:11:53.895]  Laundered a million bucks plus, reportedly, allegedly, for his girlfriend, his mistress.
[01:11:54.635 --> 01:11:55.195]  His squeeze.
[01:11:57.103 --> 01:12:02.446]  The point is, look, I'm not for Rush Limbaugh going to prison for Oxycontin.
[01:12:03.286 --> 01:12:04.086]  It's a disease.
[01:12:04.386 --> 01:12:05.087]  He hurt his back.
[01:12:05.127 --> 01:12:05.807]  He got addicted.
[01:12:06.047 --> 01:12:09.449]  And I'm not for some 15-year-old caught with cocaine to go to prison.
[01:12:09.649 --> 01:12:10.089]  Same thing.
[01:12:11.005 --> 01:12:13.967]  You know, these victimless crimes, folks, uh-uh.
[01:12:14.768 --> 01:12:19.311]  But you commit crimes that have victims, see, then you get away with it if you're part of the establishment.
[01:12:19.631 --> 01:12:26.796]  But this does show us they lie continually, in our face, arrogantly, and we've just been conditioned to accept it.
[01:12:27.237 --> 01:12:33.782]  And then if you question this government, individually and collectively, that nine times out of ten, if you look at history, is lying,
[01:12:34.522 --> 01:12:46.288]  They tell us they got Bin Laden, but don't show us the body, won't release a photo, their story changes, fake Situation Room photos, and I'm called a conspiracy theorist because I don't just out of hand immediately believe them?
[01:12:47.168 --> 01:12:50.930]  And I have government sources nine years ago that said he was dead and will be rolled out later?
[01:12:50.950 --> 01:12:53.372]  And it's all done in a theatrical way?
[01:12:53.412 --> 01:12:54.572]  You can see how it's staged?
[01:12:55.733 --> 01:12:57.274]  I question Adam Gadahn.
[01:12:58.422 --> 01:13:07.585]  An American, one of the number one guys in Al Qaeda, is a Jewish guy from Southern California whose granddaddy was the head of the ADL?
[01:13:09.574 --> 01:13:17.076]  And then he says attack shopping malls and, you know, because we have a bad Second Amendment written right out of the Violence Policy Center, you know, playbook.
[01:13:17.376 --> 01:13:19.637]  And I'm not supposed to just see that and question that?
[01:13:20.217 --> 01:13:22.918]  I mean, Al-Qaeda is following a Jewish kid?
[01:13:22.978 --> 01:13:23.818]  I mean, come on, folks.
[01:13:24.578 --> 01:13:24.918]  Come on.
[01:13:25.398 --> 01:13:25.718]  Come on.
[01:13:26.058 --> 01:13:26.539]  Grow up.
[01:13:26.599 --> 01:13:27.179]  It's theater.
[01:13:27.579 --> 01:13:29.900]  They're using the Al-Qaeda threat to come after our guns.
[01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:31.600]  Obama's set to make the announcement.
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:33.781]  It goes on and on and on.
[01:13:34.121 --> 01:13:35.021]  Here's some of the other news.
[01:13:36.866 --> 01:13:40.589]  Mexican drug gangs building own tanks as war intensifies.
[01:13:40.609 --> 01:13:42.571]  We've got the video up on Infowars.com.
[01:13:42.811 --> 01:13:45.553]  They look like blackwater armored vehicles.
[01:13:45.573 --> 01:13:46.674]  They basically copied those.
[01:13:47.114 --> 01:13:49.176]  Gigantic things right out of the Road Warrior.
[01:13:49.196 --> 01:13:51.238]  In fact, the Road Warrior wishes he had these.
[01:13:51.678 --> 01:13:52.099]  Meanwhile,
[01:13:53.103 --> 01:13:57.804]  British tourist, cruise passengers, tell of seven-hour security revenge nightmare.
[01:13:58.124 --> 01:13:59.884]  They didn't want a retina scan and thumbprint.
[01:14:00.744 --> 01:14:07.445]  One of them complained, so the TSA-controlled customs told them, we're going to punish you.
[01:14:07.465 --> 01:14:13.767]  And for seven hours, stood them out in the hot sun, retina scanned them, screamed at them to get into the United States.
[01:14:14.487 --> 01:14:16.127]  They flew here to get on a cruise.
[01:14:17.087 --> 01:14:21.668]  And then before they could get, I mean, meanwhile, the border, it's a war zone down here.
[01:14:22.950 --> 01:14:25.192]  So questioning is not a conspiracy theory.
[01:14:25.292 --> 01:14:29.435]  Questioning hypocrisy and a government that lies to you over and over again is common sense.
[01:14:29.935 --> 01:14:30.416]  All right, that's it.
[01:14:30.456 --> 01:14:31.516]  Let's go to your phone calls here.
[01:14:31.536 --> 01:14:34.358]  Let me punch them up here.
[01:14:34.519 --> 01:14:35.539]  They're not up on my screen.
[01:14:36.020 --> 01:14:39.342]  Let's talk to Ed and PA and then Peter, Don, Kathy and Tim.
[01:14:39.362 --> 01:14:39.842]  Go ahead, Ed.
[01:14:39.862 --> 01:14:44.546]  Alex, I would say the best tabloid out there is The Globe.
[01:14:45.347 --> 01:14:51.231]  And in 2008, on the April edition, the cover story was Hillary's gay love scandal.
[01:14:52.341 --> 01:14:54.844]  And that is Mr. Weiner's wife.
[01:14:55.365 --> 01:14:58.969]  And they're in Switzerland right now, probably together, going to go to the Bilderberg.
[01:14:59.610 --> 01:15:00.751]  So I think this is all scripted.
[01:15:04.204 --> 01:15:04.805]  I noticed.
[01:15:05.305 --> 01:15:06.406]  I remember hearing that.
[01:15:06.706 --> 01:15:09.349]  Guys, will you pull up scandal Hillary's gay lover?
[01:15:10.350 --> 01:15:12.392]  Because I remember that, but I want to check it for memory.
[01:15:12.432 --> 01:15:13.833]  I'm not saying you're lying.
[01:15:13.853 --> 01:15:17.637]  I just have to trust but verify, as Ronald Reagan would say here, Ed.
[01:15:18.778 --> 01:15:20.479]  But they are confidants.
[01:15:20.519 --> 01:15:23.702]  His wife does work for Hillary.
[01:15:26.653 --> 01:15:31.176]  This stuff's always the tip of the iceberg, but why would they script this?
[01:15:31.696 --> 01:15:36.599]  Why would Weiner destroy himself like this by releasing these photos?
[01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:43.543]  Alex, she's called Hillary's body person, and that she's her traveling chief.
[01:15:44.163 --> 01:15:45.164]  They're together day and night.
[01:15:45.244 --> 01:15:52.648]  I don't care about the lesbian thing, but to keep us from even thinking about Bilderberg, you know, because they were saying, where's your wife?
[01:15:52.688 --> 01:15:53.249]  Where's your wife?
[01:15:54.333 --> 01:16:01.198]  Also, Newt Gingrich, we now learn, is in Europe and is being secretive about what he's going to be attending.
[01:16:01.538 --> 01:16:06.841]  And Hillary's been caught repeatedly going to Bilderberg and then lying about it and saying she wasn't there.
[01:16:07.261 --> 01:16:09.823]  We caught her in Canada in 2006 and 2008 with Obama.
[01:16:10.043 --> 01:16:13.906]  We called all the media and said, here's Obama, here's the Secret Service, motorcade,
[01:16:14.647 --> 01:16:15.428]  They're both there.
[01:16:16.009 --> 01:16:19.254]  The number one story in the country is where are they hiding, missing for a day?
[01:16:19.554 --> 01:16:20.616]  We're jumping up and down.
[01:16:20.676 --> 01:16:25.784]  Here they are, Secret Service drives by with their machine guns aimed at us, out their windows.
[01:16:27.216 --> 01:16:30.217]  I mean, it was, it was the, oh, it's just incredible.
[01:16:30.797 --> 01:16:35.218]  Absolutely incredible of how controlled this media is, but less and less, Ed.
[01:16:35.578 --> 01:16:36.458]  Ed, that's a good point.
[01:16:36.478 --> 01:16:39.239]  I remember the lesbian lover scandal, and you know what?
[01:16:39.279 --> 01:16:44.701]  A lot of these tabloids like, like, uh, the Enquirer, they turn out to be accurate.
[01:16:45.001 --> 01:16:46.441]  You know, they were right about John Edwards.
[01:16:46.961 --> 01:16:48.302]  They've been right about so many other things.
[01:16:48.342 --> 01:16:49.142]  I appreciate your call.
[01:16:49.162 --> 01:16:49.822]  We'll look into that.
[01:16:54.358 --> 01:17:04.606]  Okay, and first Ventura was going to be on at noon, then he was going to be on at 1230, but he's joining us a little bit early right now in his scheduling, and then we'll go back to your calls.
[01:17:05.226 --> 01:17:17.596]  And his new book, of course, available at Infowars.com, 63 documents the government doesn't want you to read, has gone up to, what, number four on the New York Times bestselling list, number one on Amazon, off and on.
[01:17:18.076 --> 01:17:21.659]  Very exciting to have the Gov back with us again.
[01:17:24.031 --> 01:17:25.092]  Hi Alex, how are you?
[01:17:25.572 --> 01:17:26.172]  I'm good!
[01:17:26.232 --> 01:17:28.053]  I tell you, they must have you busy today.
[01:17:28.273 --> 01:17:38.037]  Yeah, unfortunately they had me drive to do a TV thing and when you do these damn things they don't take into account traffic and things of that nature.
[01:17:38.597 --> 01:17:42.759]  And I told them there's no way I can make it from there to my house in 30 minutes.
[01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:50.223]  And so that's why they moved you back to 1230 but I made it as fast as I can and I got the door at 1215 because it took about 45.
[01:17:51.623 --> 01:17:54.504]  And so I called immediately and we'll get the extra 15 here.
[01:17:54.524 --> 01:17:56.185]  No, I haven't gotten no cigars.
[01:17:56.205 --> 01:17:56.745]  I hope not.
[01:17:56.785 --> 01:17:58.046]  You didn't send me any, did you?
[01:17:58.066 --> 01:18:00.387]  Oh God, I don't know whether... I'll have to check and see.
[01:18:00.407 --> 01:18:02.107]  How long ago did you send them?
[01:18:16.154 --> 01:18:20.237]  I should have them, then.
[01:18:20.257 --> 01:18:22.198]  I'll have to look around and see if they showed up.
[01:18:22.218 --> 01:18:23.980]  Maybe my wife's hiding them from me.
[01:18:25.481 --> 01:18:26.562]  That could be it, Alex.
[01:18:26.622 --> 01:18:28.423]  She maybe found them before I could.
[01:18:28.503 --> 01:18:29.124]  She hid them.
[01:18:29.551 --> 01:18:32.193]  Well, you bought me a couple of them and I thought they were so good, I got you a box.
[01:18:32.253 --> 01:18:33.094]  Oh, thank you.
[01:18:33.374 --> 01:18:34.515]  And then so I got you another box.
[01:18:34.535 --> 01:18:44.402]  Okay, I'm sorry to be contributing to the delinquents, but I think you look cool with the cigar, but actually we don't want you to die of lip cancer, Governor, so just give those to your friends then.
[01:18:44.602 --> 01:18:48.044]  Alright, I'll find some good use for them, whatever it may be.
[01:18:48.404 --> 01:18:49.085]  The golf course?
[01:18:50.286 --> 01:18:50.606]  Maybe.
[01:18:51.467 --> 01:18:52.387]  Well, we'll see what happens.
[01:18:52.507 --> 01:18:54.389]  As long as you don't have a Clintonista use.
[01:18:54.569 --> 01:18:54.849]  Yeah.
[01:18:55.169 --> 01:18:57.171]  Anyway, how's things been since I left?
[01:18:58.338 --> 01:18:59.239]  A lot has been happening.
[01:18:59.279 --> 01:19:04.363]  What do you make of this congenital lying of Weiner and the whole Weiner scandal?
[01:19:04.423 --> 01:19:08.986]  I'd rather focus on the banker bailouts, the CIA drug dealing, but what a crazy guy.
[01:19:09.286 --> 01:19:15.971]  Why do these politicians think they can get away with emailing or twittering out photos of their... Here's what you got.
[01:19:16.051 --> 01:19:19.833]  I tried to explain this on the TV show with Neil Caluto yesterday.
[01:19:20.434 --> 01:19:22.215]  And I said, here's the problem, Alex.
[01:19:22.255 --> 01:19:23.216]  It's the big picture.
[01:19:24.002 --> 01:19:35.585]  You have a system created by the Democrats and Republicans that is so corrupt, its basic premise it relies upon is panhandling and bribery.
[01:19:36.245 --> 01:19:37.686]  That's how they get their money.
[01:19:38.186 --> 01:19:48.429]  They go out and they panhandle, give me money so I can go do this job, or if someone gives them money and they return it in a favor, well that's bribery.
[01:19:49.029 --> 01:20:02.320]  So in order to survive in this system which starts up at the local level, progresses to the state level, and of course gets bigger and on to the national level, you have to be comfortable with those two concepts.
[01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:04.742]  Panhandling and bribery.
[01:20:05.482 --> 01:20:12.345]  So, anyone that reaches that level is obviously comfortable dealing in that corrupted system.
[01:20:12.725 --> 01:20:15.766]  So, Alex, you're going to get not the best of the best.
[01:20:16.326 --> 01:20:26.230]  You're going to get people who are somewhat borderline criminals to begin with because of the system and how it's built and what the Democrats and Republicans have created.
[01:20:26.250 --> 01:20:27.931]  Well, I'll tell you what scares me.
[01:20:28.971 --> 01:20:45.238]  And I've interviewed a lot of psychologists and psychiatrists, you know, looking at the profile of Western governments, and they say that people like Weiner, Edwards, and others, who have no self-control, who are out of control, and who are reckless and narcissistic, are the model, are the rule, not the exception.
[01:20:45.598 --> 01:20:58.084]  These are the people that are in control of our economy, the nuclear weapons, the intelligence, and it's scary to think about the fact that they're so reckless and our civilization is in their hands.
[01:20:58.860 --> 01:21:00.002]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:21:00.042 --> 01:21:11.418]  You know, it's astounding to believe in today's technology that when you go into those jobs, they all seem to think that they will be the one to get away with bad behavior.
[01:21:12.330 --> 01:21:20.855]  And in today's world, you know, you might have got away with that back in the 50s and 60s when the press didn't look at people's private lives that much.
[01:21:21.336 --> 01:21:24.698]  You didn't have the computer generation out there.
[01:21:25.258 --> 01:21:29.240]  You didn't have everything you have today where they can photograph you with their phones.
[01:21:30.121 --> 01:21:38.706]  And, you know, so anyone that gets in a position like that and thinks they're going to misbehave and get away with it is sadly mistaken.
[01:21:38.766 --> 01:21:40.007]  It ain't gonna happen anymore.
[01:21:42.008 --> 01:21:48.850]  Jesse, what do you think should happen to Congressman Weiner-Stencel?
[01:21:49.170 --> 01:21:49.651]  I don't know.
[01:21:49.911 --> 01:21:52.232]  You know, he's a Democrat and Republican, you know.
[01:21:52.532 --> 01:21:54.492]  He'll probably get censored, you know.
[01:21:54.512 --> 01:21:59.494]  They have their own, let's remember something, they don't get punished the way we do.
[01:22:00.174 --> 01:22:02.195]  You know, look at it in this aspect, Alex.
[01:22:02.655 --> 01:22:05.676]  If we lie to the government, we go to jail.
[01:22:06.216 --> 01:22:07.897]  Case in point, Martha Stewart.
[01:22:08.610 --> 01:22:15.356]  Barry Bonds might go to jail and Roger Clemens might go to jail for just simply lying to the government.
[01:22:15.857 --> 01:22:19.200]  But when the government lies to us, nothing happens to them.
[01:22:20.121 --> 01:22:22.603]  They make you, you probably get censured or something.
[01:22:22.663 --> 01:22:25.045]  I used to laugh about that when I did talk radio.
[01:22:25.706 --> 01:22:26.827]  They censure you.
[01:22:26.847 --> 01:22:28.448]  Well, what the hell is that?
[01:22:28.468 --> 01:22:31.852]  Why don't they use that on me out here in the regular world?
[01:22:31.932 --> 01:22:34.234]  I'd like to go rob the bank and just get censured.
[01:22:35.998 --> 01:22:47.805]  Well, that's like Wells Fargo and its subsidiary, $376 billion in laundered drug money over two years, and they were given a $100 million fine.
[01:22:47.845 --> 01:22:48.765]  That's 0.3%.
[01:22:50.286 --> 01:22:51.687]  So that's pretty good, Governor.
[01:22:51.727 --> 01:22:52.668]  You rob a bank.
[01:22:53.388 --> 01:22:53.628]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:22:53.668 --> 01:22:54.609]  And that's the way it operates.
[01:22:54.629 --> 01:22:56.490]  We do not have... We have two sets of justice in this country.
[01:22:56.830 --> 01:22:59.111]  One for the elites and the powerful, and one for the rest of us.
[01:23:16.119 --> 01:23:19.146]  And unfortunately, we're all caught in the rest of us thing.
[01:23:19.166 --> 01:23:23.655]  They don't, uh... Like I said, if we lie to the government, we go to jail.
[01:23:24.076 --> 01:23:26.761]  They lie to us all the time, and they get promoted.
[01:23:28.220 --> 01:23:34.244]  Well, I know that even Carville, the big Clinton advisor, has said that it's the economy, stupid.
[01:23:34.765 --> 01:23:38.867]  Now there's reports that Obama is now very unpopular on college campuses with liberals.
[01:23:39.268 --> 01:23:42.990]  Headline on college campuses, Obama's not so cool anymore.
[01:23:43.631 --> 01:23:47.754]  People are waking up that he's just another puppet, but will they embrace the next puppet?
[01:23:47.894 --> 01:23:52.697]  Everything's coming to a head and Carville is saying that civil unrest is imminent.
[01:23:54.378 --> 01:23:59.341]  The joblessness numbers are now confirmed to be depression level, and that's with Cook numbers that are lower.
[01:23:59.901 --> 01:24:05.385]  The housing slump has now surpassed depression levels, according to the London Independent analysis.
[01:24:06.445 --> 01:24:10.188]  But the establishment is telling us, Governor, the economy is wonderful!
[01:24:11.088 --> 01:24:18.733]  Uh, and uh, you know, Weiner didn't send those pictures, and oh, oh, and Libya is in a ground war, and we were going to be out in days, not weeks.
[01:24:18.793 --> 01:24:19.553]  Remember Obama?
[01:24:19.853 --> 01:24:24.276]  I mean, it seems like we've woken up in 1984, but it is starting to come to a head.
[01:24:24.556 --> 01:24:25.436]  What do you see happening?
[01:24:25.556 --> 01:24:27.658]  Well, I don't know if it is, Alex, you know.
[01:24:28.458 --> 01:24:32.380]  Uh, I hear a lot of talk about it, but it's all amongst the same people.
[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:36.863]  You and I, and this and that, and you know, I'm not sure.
[01:24:37.583 --> 01:24:38.804]  Uh, this country, to me,
[01:24:39.984 --> 01:24:42.405]  I'm not sure what to make of it anymore.
[01:24:44.645 --> 01:24:45.825]  I really am baffled.
[01:24:46.985 --> 01:24:48.166]  I will tell you this.
[01:24:48.826 --> 01:24:51.326]  I was attacked by the 9-11 truthers.
[01:24:51.606 --> 01:24:52.446]  Unbelievably.
[01:24:54.267 --> 01:24:58.347]  Because of a few things I've mentioned and asked questions about on 9-11.
[01:24:59.807 --> 01:25:02.188]  I was accused by them of selling out.
[01:25:03.628 --> 01:25:08.569]  And I got upset over it and I will tell you this today on your show because it's the best way to tell it.
[01:25:09.326 --> 01:25:16.556]  When this book is over, because this book deals with 9-11, I am going to, at that point, not discuss 9-11 anymore.
[01:25:16.576 --> 01:25:21.282]  Because I feel like I got blasted from my own side.
[01:25:21.642 --> 01:25:22.684]  I'm on an island now.
[01:25:24.822 --> 01:25:30.086]  The truthers don't like me, and neither do I suppose does the government, because I ask questions.
[01:25:30.166 --> 01:25:33.649]  Governor Ventura, that's classic internet.
[01:25:34.109 --> 01:25:35.450]  A lot of it's COINTELPRO.
[01:25:35.490 --> 01:25:38.413]  Just because people claim they're attacking you.
[01:25:38.793 --> 01:25:40.654]  There's 7 billion people in the world.
[01:25:41.075 --> 01:25:42.095]  You're a prominent guy.
[01:25:42.155 --> 01:25:43.196]  I mean, you know this.
[01:25:43.256 --> 01:25:44.918]  I'm preaching to the preacher here.
[01:25:44.938 --> 01:25:54.345]  I mean, just because some minority group gets mad at you because you say it looks like standard explosives, and you're a controlled demolition expert.
[01:25:55.266 --> 01:25:56.847]  Oh no, it wasn't over that.
[01:25:57.027 --> 01:25:59.529]  I was debunking all three of the standard things.
[01:26:16.041 --> 01:26:20.082]  Well, you know, I'll give it due consideration, but for me it's like, you know, Alex,
[01:26:43.326 --> 01:26:45.327]  It's like pounding your head against a wall.
[01:26:45.407 --> 01:26:48.729]  After a while it starts to hurt and you want to stop doing it.
[01:26:48.749 --> 01:26:49.450]  Well, let me say this.
[01:26:50.671 --> 01:26:57.835]  You talk about the American people being in a trance or being jellyfish and why can't they get upset.
[01:26:57.875 --> 01:27:00.757]  Well, they have been disempowered.
[01:27:00.817 --> 01:27:02.418]  They feel like they don't have any power.
[01:27:02.478 --> 01:27:04.559]  We've got to lead and show them they have power.
[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:06.701]  Congress has a 9% approval rating.
[01:27:07.443 --> 01:27:07.503]  The
[01:27:23.567 --> 01:27:23.747]  Yeah.
[01:27:42.935 --> 01:27:45.256]  We've been targeted by a scientific dictatorship.
[01:27:45.316 --> 01:27:46.157]  I have all their documents.
[01:27:46.197 --> 01:27:46.737]  I'll send them to you.
[01:27:46.977 --> 01:27:49.118]  I hope you write a book about that, because we need your voice.
[01:27:49.679 --> 01:27:53.080]  And the public is in a mesmerized state, Governor.
[01:27:53.561 --> 01:28:04.166]  They're in a mesmerized... We've got... I mean, somebody who's been drugged, you know, by kidnappers, you don't get mad at them when you bust into the shack to try to free them, but they're drugged on the floor, drooling.
[01:28:04.186 --> 01:28:11.150]  You've got to pick them up and put them on your shoulders, get them to the brook, pour some water on them, or shoot them up with adrenaline if you have to, to get them going.
[01:28:12.392 --> 01:28:13.694]  Well, yeah, I guess so.
[01:28:13.734 --> 01:28:16.777]  I guess I just need to take my periodic breaks from it, Alex.
[01:28:17.699 --> 01:28:19.400]  I'm not getting any younger, you know.
[01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:20.440]  Hey, I don't blame you.
[01:28:20.540 --> 01:28:23.181]  My instinct is, get out of Dodge, get away from this.
[01:28:23.741 --> 01:28:25.002]  All of Rome is collapsing.
[01:28:25.022 --> 01:28:26.743]  Everybody can feel the collapse happening.
[01:28:27.163 --> 01:28:43.269]  Well, I certainly hope that it isn't, but, you know, it's like I said, it becomes very frustrating to you to, you know, constantly be telling people and, I don't know, I guess I kind of view myself now, if I can be so bold, I want to replace Hunter Thompson.
[01:28:44.821 --> 01:28:56.209]  Hunter's gone now, and I read some of his works this winter and found that he was writing in the 60s about exactly what happened at the turn of the century, and what was happening to us and our country.
[01:28:56.249 --> 01:28:56.930]  He predicted it!
[01:28:57.210 --> 01:28:58.671]  Yeah, he predicted tons of it.
[01:28:59.432 --> 01:29:05.116]  And hopefully, maybe that's what I can try to do in a way, as I get on in my years here.
[01:29:05.529 --> 01:29:06.330]  No, exactly.
[01:29:06.350 --> 01:29:08.852]  I mean, that is the greatest human instinct.
[01:29:08.872 --> 01:29:17.899]  And in the hierarchy of needs, you have now reached the capstone in that you understand we're all transitory, but through the human species, you know, we live on.
[01:29:18.019 --> 01:29:24.985]  And it's the information you transmit forward, just like the Cave of Dreams in France, 30-plus thousand years old.
[01:29:25.745 --> 01:29:28.948]  And it's that human need to communicate with the future.
[01:29:29.348 --> 01:29:32.591]  Governor Jesse Ventura, a host of issues coming up.
[01:29:33.611 --> 01:29:37.074]  During the next break, it's funny that every time you pop in, it's on a Tuesday.
[01:29:37.094 --> 01:29:48.443]  We're going to do that local Freedom Nugget on 93.7 here in just a moment with you, Governor, and we're going to come back live with everybody and get into a host of issues and take phone calls and talk about Governor Ventura's new book.
[01:29:48.463 --> 01:29:48.904]  Stay with us.
[01:29:50.565 --> 01:29:51.446]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.946 --> 01:29:53.547]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.488 --> 01:29:57.150]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.697 --> 01:30:06.081]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:30:07.362 --> 01:30:12.126]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:30:12.506 --> 01:30:19.271]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:30:21.233 --> 01:30:23.755]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:30:25.296 --> 01:30:27.237]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[01:30:29.728 --> 01:30:33.591]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[01:30:34.311 --> 01:30:37.434]  Blue diamond gussets, got it.
[01:30:38.134 --> 01:30:38.955]  Others don't.
[01:30:39.375 --> 01:30:41.256]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:30:41.516 --> 01:30:43.018]  Diamond gusset jeans.

[01:32:08.833 --> 01:32:11.254]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:32:11.274 --> 01:32:16.716]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[01:32:17.136 --> 01:32:23.378]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:32:23.798 --> 01:32:29.340]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:32:29.780 --> 01:32:33.461]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.

[01:32:44.184 --> 01:32:47.165]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:32:47.745 --> 01:32:49.166]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:32:49.726 --> 01:32:50.146]  It's here.

[01:33:31.736 --> 01:33:33.197]  So again, InfoWars.com.

[01:33:42.484 --> 01:33:44.105]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:33:44.606 --> 01:33:49.730]  Now, going back to Governor Ventura, Gov, you brought up the fact that as a guy who went through
[01:33:51.540 --> 01:34:14.080]  Demolition training, as a Navy Frogman, as a UDT, and then into the SEALs, expanding into that, that you understand controlled demolition, and they now have had to admit that Building 7 did fall at freefall, NIST has changed its story five or six times, but you look at Tower 1 and 2, they are exploding with gigantic explosions from the top,
[01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:18.101]  And turning into dust and the human bodies blown into tiny pieces.
[01:34:18.801 --> 01:34:30.464]  And there are hundreds of these high-def photos released by the government that show for blocks around toasted cars with the metal melted but the vinyl and the dashboards not damaged.
[01:34:30.504 --> 01:34:32.245]  Now, what attacks metal?
[01:34:32.965 --> 01:34:37.087]  And makes it do that, but doesn't affect plastic.
[01:34:37.687 --> 01:34:39.067]  Does sound like a super weapon.
[01:34:39.488 --> 01:34:50.492]  I just never really go there because I can't get folks to understand that a magic passport doesn't come out of Mohammed Adda's shirt, through the fireball, and then be found on the ground by the FBI.
[01:34:50.712 --> 01:34:53.253]  The fact that it was found is almost impossible.
[01:34:53.433 --> 01:34:56.854]  The fact that it survived unharmed is impossible.
[01:34:57.115 --> 01:35:00.336]  So if I can't get them to even... We have official FEMA camp
[01:35:00.876 --> 01:35:05.798]  Purchases by FEMA in the Houston Chronicle, and we can't get folks to admit they're building FEMA camps.
[01:35:06.759 --> 01:35:07.659]  So that's why I haven't gone there.
[01:35:07.679 --> 01:35:08.520]  But Governor, break it down.
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:15.143]  Well, it's a question that came to some of the reading I did on these toasted cars.
[01:35:15.223 --> 01:35:16.083]  It's remarkable.
[01:35:17.104 --> 01:35:20.966]  Alex, there were over 1,000 of them, and they were as far away as the FDR.
[01:35:22.950 --> 01:35:26.191]  Which is probably six, eight blocks from the Trade Center.
[01:35:26.652 --> 01:35:29.353]  And there were cars flipped over on their hoods.
[01:35:29.833 --> 01:35:35.255]  And in the photos, you see the cars flipped on its back, but the leaves are still on the trees.
[01:35:36.436 --> 01:35:40.577]  And that's the point of what I'm looking at here, going, how could this happen?
[01:35:41.138 --> 01:35:46.480]  What is the explanation for toasted cars all over Manhattan that day?
[01:35:48.885 --> 01:35:50.386]  Well, you're not supposed to ask that.
[01:35:51.046 --> 01:35:54.807]  Getting back... I mean, you don't do that with conventional demolition.
[01:35:54.827 --> 01:36:04.091]  I saw a thing on the internet where the nanothermite people claim the cars got toasted from hot nanothermite in the dust.
[01:36:04.731 --> 01:36:08.312]  Well, that's bogus, Alex, because the dust was hitting people.
[01:36:08.852 --> 01:36:10.433]  And people were not burning.
[01:36:10.453 --> 01:36:13.034]  Obviously, the dust was not hot.
[01:36:17.415 --> 01:36:36.532]  Well, there is an effect where if a fire is hot enough, like an oven, the metal can heat up and then... Well, there's also the effect, remember this, Alex, everything that's burning glows, but not everything that's burning glows and is hot, but not everything that glows is hot.
[01:36:39.574 --> 01:36:40.735]  No, I know, it's bizarre.
[01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:55.129]  And you know, I started talking about this on your show and that's when I really got blasted by people for even considering questions that, to me, are very relevant.
[01:36:55.169 --> 01:36:55.970]  Sure, sure, Governor.
[01:36:55.990 --> 01:36:57.031]  How do you explain this?
[01:36:57.131 --> 01:37:00.433]  How do you explain these cars toasted all over Manhattan?
[01:37:00.873 --> 01:37:06.298]  If two planes hit two buildings and the buildings crumble to the ground... Well, let's expand on that.
[01:37:06.318 --> 01:37:11.722]  ...whether they were demoed or whatever, how can buildings falling to the ground
[01:37:12.303 --> 01:37:12.746]  Toast cars!
[01:37:14.312 --> 01:37:20.435]  Well, I can have my crew search infrared photos of Ground Zero molten metal.
[01:37:21.055 --> 01:37:26.838]  It was upwards of 2,800 degrees two months after 9-11.
[01:37:26.898 --> 01:37:31.560]  Kerosene burns at well under 1,000 degrees less.
[01:37:31.980 --> 01:37:40.725]  We have the videotapes of the firefighters reporting molten metal like a slurry or a steel mill or a volcano.
[01:37:40.785 --> 01:37:41.605]  Those are quotes.
[01:37:42.385 --> 01:37:43.086]  Giant pools.
[01:37:43.626 --> 01:37:49.589]  What about the pictures of them dragging oxygen hoses all over the steaming supposed hot metal?
[01:37:51.190 --> 01:37:53.891]  If it were that hot, you wouldn't dare do that, would ya?
[01:37:53.911 --> 01:38:00.675]  Well, we do have the infrared photos of the molten metal.
[01:38:00.695 --> 01:38:04.456]  Well, again, what melted the metal?
[01:38:05.597 --> 01:38:06.297]  Was it heat?
[01:38:06.938 --> 01:38:13.321]  Or was it, you know, to me, and the point was made of putting into the context of a microwave oven.
[01:38:14.736 --> 01:38:23.860]  When you put a piece of chicken on a paper plate and put it in the oven, the chicken will burn and yet the paper plate will be unharmed.
[01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:36.506]  And you had all this paper flying all over Manhattan and yet, in the rubble, there wasn't one file cabinet wrecked or anything.
[01:38:36.566 --> 01:38:39.707]  I think they found one from the Tom and Jerry store.
[01:38:42.268 --> 01:38:46.552]  Now what destroys the file cabinets but allows the paper to survive?
[01:38:48.373 --> 01:38:58.082]  That is amazing because we saw the tens of millions of pieces of paper coming out after it collapsed and then human body parts weren't found that were bigger than an inch.
[01:38:58.722 --> 01:38:59.523]  Very bizarre.
[01:39:00.244 --> 01:39:08.451]  And how does the paper survive and yet if it was so hot that it could collapse a building, paper burns way faster than metal does.
[01:39:09.130 --> 01:39:20.075]  Well, look at the secret helicopter that crashed and blew up with the reported Navy SEALs at the whole Bin Laden Easter Bunny raid.
[01:39:20.695 --> 01:39:23.616]  And that was a totally secret helicopter.
[01:39:23.636 --> 01:39:26.938]  I mean, there is so much super Black Ops stuff.
[01:39:27.478 --> 01:39:30.200]  That reportedly the President isn't even let into.
[01:39:30.500 --> 01:39:32.982]  The Federal Reserve tells Congress they're above the law.
[01:39:33.002 --> 01:39:34.163]  No agency can look at them.
[01:39:34.183 --> 01:39:38.827]  I mean, we have multi-levels of private corporate governance above us.
[01:39:39.388 --> 01:39:50.436]  And so shifting gears into a similar area, since we talked to you a month ago, I've seen reports that the Navy SEALs are being totally quiet, that there's secret subgroups of SEAL Team 6.
[01:39:51.617 --> 01:39:53.559]  They've had to change the story over and over again.
[01:39:53.599 --> 01:39:56.522]  They admit the Situation Room video photo was fake.
[01:39:57.303 --> 01:39:58.665]  He didn't have a firefight with him.
[01:39:58.685 --> 01:40:00.146]  They threw the body in the ocean.
[01:40:00.467 --> 01:40:03.750]  They said they had DNA proof a day before it could have been available.
[01:40:04.771 --> 01:40:10.177]  What scuttlebutt are you getting from other Navy SEALs that you know in the Navy community?
[01:40:10.457 --> 01:40:11.458]  Unfortunately none.
[01:40:11.819 --> 01:40:13.000]  I haven't talked to anybody.
[01:40:14.419 --> 01:40:15.820]  Nothing has been said to me.
[01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:18.703]  I can only go by what we were told.
[01:40:19.623 --> 01:40:21.345]  Whether it's true or not, I don't know.
[01:40:21.365 --> 01:40:25.668]  And I can't answer anything there for you, Alex.
[01:40:25.788 --> 01:40:30.011]  I have not received no scuttlebutt, nor will I. You have to remember something.
[01:40:30.992 --> 01:40:34.455]  I don't think you're going to get anything that actually comes out of the Navy SEALs.
[01:40:35.974 --> 01:40:40.718]  I don't think, it may be attributed to them, but I highly doubt if it is.
[01:40:41.419 --> 01:40:43.441]  Because they're not going to talk about nothing.
[01:40:43.881 --> 01:40:52.088]  You know what, Pakistan National TV has talked to all the locals, and they say the men got on the helicopter, it took off and then blew up.
[01:40:53.049 --> 01:40:59.275]  How convenient, and more and more experts I've interviewed are saying, that's the word, is there all these bin Laden doubles.
[01:40:59.915 --> 01:41:01.556]  And neighbors said, yeah, I knew him.
[01:41:01.596 --> 01:41:02.437]  He looked like Bin Laden.
[01:41:02.457 --> 01:41:03.077]  That wasn't him.
[01:41:03.397 --> 01:41:04.038]  They go in.
[01:41:04.478 --> 01:41:05.359]  They kill the guy.
[01:41:06.659 --> 01:41:07.840]  The SEALs get the body.
[01:41:07.880 --> 01:41:08.961]  That's what witnesses saw.
[01:41:09.361 --> 01:41:10.982]  Haul it onto the helicopter.
[01:41:11.062 --> 01:41:13.064]  This is on national Pakistani TV.
[01:41:13.424 --> 01:41:14.865]  It takes off and blows up.
[01:41:15.125 --> 01:41:16.386]  You get rid of everybody right there.
[01:41:17.293 --> 01:41:25.000]  Well, I haven't heard that there's been that sealed casualty list, and I'm sure I would hear something about that if there were casualties.
[01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:34.049]  Well, we had over 10,000 deaths from 60 to 64 before they officially launched the Vietnam War that were kept secret until the mid-90s.
[01:41:34.609 --> 01:41:34.910]  Yeah.
[01:41:35.610 --> 01:41:40.155]  Well, maybe so, but within our community, we usually know who's died and who hasn't.
[01:41:41.983 --> 01:41:46.908]  You know, if they keep that from us, then it is truly top secret.
[01:41:46.968 --> 01:41:47.889]  That's all I can say.
[01:41:47.949 --> 01:41:48.290]  I don't know.
[01:41:48.990 --> 01:41:50.051]  I have no idea, Alex.
[01:41:50.071 --> 01:41:51.553]  I don't know anything more than you do.
[01:41:52.093 --> 01:41:53.475]  In fact, I know less than you do.
[01:41:54.095 --> 01:41:57.599]  I only know what I've been told on media reports and what our government has said.
[01:41:58.058 --> 01:42:01.961]  And Wiener told us he didn't take the photo, but now he admits he lied.
[01:42:02.001 --> 01:42:04.503]  I mean, what is conspiracy theory?
[01:42:04.543 --> 01:42:11.468]  I mean, is it a conspiracy theory to not believe a government and a media that has been caught lying tens of thousands of times?
[01:42:11.588 --> 01:42:13.850]  Yeah, you're still the theorist.
[01:42:14.270 --> 01:42:20.035]  No matter how many times they lie, and no matter how untruthful the mainstream media and the government is,
[01:42:21.282 --> 01:42:24.485]  Uh, we're still the conspiracy theorists.
[01:42:24.825 --> 01:42:29.909]  You know, the main thing is that we gotta remember, Alex, is the government only provides a theory.
[01:42:29.969 --> 01:42:31.511]  They never provide any facts.
[01:42:32.211 --> 01:42:39.237]  I'm still troubled over the fact that the big picture of how do we go kill someone for 9-11 who we never indicted?
[01:42:43.513 --> 01:42:49.921]  Well, I mean, don't we have a process, a legal, that we're supposed to go through in this country?
[01:42:50.402 --> 01:42:58.492]  And why are we as citizens so eager to allow them to skip the process when it comes to terrorism?
[01:42:59.835 --> 01:43:01.376]  We skip the process.
[01:43:01.776 --> 01:43:04.377]  We make exceptions to our Constitution.
[01:43:04.437 --> 01:43:06.598]  We make exceptions to our Bill of Rights.
[01:43:07.438 --> 01:43:13.120]  We make exceptions to everything when it deals with this so-called War on Terror.
[01:43:13.540 --> 01:43:18.242]  And the people are falling right into the trap that Ben Franklin warned us of, Alex.
[01:43:18.862 --> 01:43:25.345]  When Ben Franklin said, those people that trade liberty for security end up with neither.
[01:43:26.505 --> 01:43:28.306]  Don't our people get that?
[01:43:30.182 --> 01:43:37.567]  Well, in every case of history, if people that come to you saying, give me your freedom, I'll keep you safe, nightmare tyranny always unfolds.
[01:43:37.827 --> 01:43:38.127]  Yes.
[01:43:39.688 --> 01:43:46.853]  How come we're so stupid that we can't look at simple modern day history and see that that is the case?
[01:43:51.096 --> 01:43:52.276]  Well, I have to tell you, um,
[01:43:54.540 --> 01:43:56.381]  That's what frustrates me, Alex.
[01:43:56.921 --> 01:43:58.942]  That's what makes me want to move on.
[01:43:59.102 --> 01:44:00.943]  That's what makes me want to retire.
[01:44:01.603 --> 01:44:05.085]  Because it's like you're preaching and no one's listening.
[01:44:08.646 --> 01:44:10.767]  Governor, it's the scientific dictatorship.
[01:44:10.827 --> 01:44:12.728]  They understand our psychology.
[01:44:12.788 --> 01:44:14.409]  They understand our mindsets.
[01:44:15.609 --> 01:44:22.673]  They have purposefully scrambled people's brains in this sick culture to the point that most people
[01:44:23.635 --> 01:44:24.555]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:44:24.575 --> 01:44:31.117]  You know, but hopefully, you know, as I said, hopefully the minority can get the majority to wake up, and I'm starting to wonder about it.
[01:44:50.936 --> 01:44:51.976]  What about the TV show?
[01:44:52.036 --> 01:44:53.337]  What's the word on that?
[01:44:53.457 --> 01:44:53.957]  I wonder.
[01:44:53.977 --> 01:44:59.058]  Braverman's been calling me a whole bunch and I haven't even called him back.
[01:44:59.218 --> 01:45:00.418]  I've gotten so busy.
[01:45:11.101 --> 01:45:11.561]  I don't know.
[01:45:11.641 --> 01:45:19.825]  You know, they haven't made a new deal with me, but my son's back on payroll, so, and they've ordered a pickup of eight more conspiracies.
[01:45:20.825 --> 01:45:22.926]  I'm not happy with the eight they've chosen.
[01:45:23.106 --> 01:45:24.126]  Is that breaking here?
[01:45:24.146 --> 01:45:28.268]  Because my cell phone broke last week, and I noticed that Reverman's been calling me for a week and a half.
[01:45:28.328 --> 01:45:29.249]  I need to call him today.
[01:45:29.529 --> 01:45:30.429]  What's the word on that?
[01:45:30.709 --> 01:45:31.129]  I don't know.
[01:45:31.690 --> 01:45:36.972]  Like I said, nobody's contacted me except my son, and he said that the show's picked up.
[01:45:37.592 --> 01:45:47.765]  But like I said, my contract expired this spring and there's nobody that's made one effort to contact me to see about working arrangements for another season.
[01:45:48.486 --> 01:45:51.290]  And so maybe they're gonna do the show, like I said, without me.
[01:45:52.864 --> 01:45:54.585]  Well, that originally was your idea.
[01:45:54.605 --> 01:45:55.785]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:45:56.166 --> 01:46:00.347]  But let's remember, too, I'm in a dilemma because of my lawsuit against the TSA.
[01:46:00.668 --> 01:46:04.910]  You know, I can't get on a plane until some type of settlement occurs.
[01:46:05.370 --> 01:46:08.971]  We're due in court, I think, later this month or early July.
[01:46:09.412 --> 01:46:14.214]  Ironically, I guess I have the same judge that handled the NFL and the owners.
[01:46:17.898 --> 01:46:21.439]  Well, we know that the resistance of the TSA is mounting.
[01:46:22.059 --> 01:46:29.782]  Texas is trying to reintroduce the bill that we had a unanimous vote on, but then the Governor used his minion, the Lieutenant Governor, to kill it.
[01:46:30.162 --> 01:46:37.144]  The Senate, Perry claims he supports it, but called a special session, Governor, and will not reintroduce it so far.
[01:46:37.664 --> 01:46:40.085]  I mean, I tell you, that's a dirty politician right there.
[01:46:40.425 --> 01:46:44.887]  Well, I'll tell you, I heard about that, and I can't believe, you know, Alex,
[01:46:45.627 --> 01:46:47.628]  I thought Texans had spines.
[01:46:49.730 --> 01:46:51.871]  Well, I mean, our House voted unanimously.
[01:46:52.131 --> 01:46:53.772]  They had 30 of the 31 Senators.
[01:46:53.912 --> 01:46:55.613]  Alex, get what I'm saying?
[01:46:55.673 --> 01:46:57.114]  I'm goading you Texans.
[01:46:57.274 --> 01:46:57.774]  Come on.
[01:46:59.235 --> 01:47:03.378]  Well, you're allowed to goad us because you have filed suit on them and I've seen you stand up to them at the airport.
[01:47:03.418 --> 01:47:05.439]  Well, the point is, come on, Texas.
[01:47:05.979 --> 01:47:06.900]  Get a spine.
[01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:08.061]  You're from Texas.
[01:47:08.641 --> 01:47:10.142]  You don't mess with Texas.
[01:47:10.542 --> 01:47:11.663]  That's what I've always heard.
[01:47:13.971 --> 01:47:20.093]  So I encourage Texas to move forward on that.
[01:47:20.193 --> 01:47:22.153]  No, not really a Texan.
[01:47:22.193 --> 01:47:23.954]  I named him after Tyrell Sackett.
[01:47:23.974 --> 01:47:28.055]  The Mora Gunfighter and the Sackett family, I think, originated from Tennessee.
[01:47:28.255 --> 01:47:29.295]  Texas is westward.
[01:47:29.355 --> 01:47:29.895]  Okay, well, whatever.
[01:47:29.955 --> 01:47:32.096]  But all I know is, come on, Texas, stand up and get a spine.
[01:47:46.425 --> 01:47:46.945]  I hear you.
[01:47:47.005 --> 01:47:48.146]  Well, at least we're trying.
[01:47:48.246 --> 01:47:49.147]  At least we're leading the way.
[01:47:49.187 --> 01:47:51.208]  And now Utah says they're going to call the feds bluff.
[01:47:51.228 --> 01:47:53.749]  What do you think of them saying they'd have a federal blockade of the state?
[01:47:54.390 --> 01:47:56.631]  Well, you know, it's interesting.
[01:47:56.691 --> 01:48:02.935]  If the feds are going to do things like that, then we ought to do things back to them like everybody refused to fly for a day.
[01:48:03.375 --> 01:48:03.835]  I agree.
[01:48:03.855 --> 01:48:04.956]  See what that'll do.
[01:48:05.745 --> 01:48:08.886]  Well, see, they want to slowly bankrupt the airlines and then nationalize them.
[01:48:09.226 --> 01:48:11.427]  They don't want to have it all overnight happen.
[01:48:11.687 --> 01:48:12.207]  So I agree.
[01:48:12.307 --> 01:48:13.527]  Listen, my family doesn't fly.
[01:48:13.547 --> 01:48:15.728]  I cannot let people grab my daughters.
[01:48:15.788 --> 01:48:17.929]  I just, I cannot put up with it.
[01:48:18.029 --> 01:48:21.430]  And folks, I tried once and did get really angry.
[01:48:21.890 --> 01:48:23.270]  And I'm not going to get into the whole story.
[01:48:23.510 --> 01:48:25.551]  But the point is, is that I can't handle it.
[01:48:26.251 --> 01:48:38.917]  I can't either, and that's why as a country we ought to get an official day where everybody boycotts flying and down the airlines for a day in protest to all of us.
[01:48:39.037 --> 01:48:41.038]  Wait, let's have National Opt-Out Week.
[01:48:41.778 --> 01:48:43.239]  Let's go ahead and call it right now.
[01:48:43.319 --> 01:48:44.479]  We've got the movement to do it.
[01:48:44.519 --> 01:48:46.280]  I'll have my riders do a report.
[01:48:46.580 --> 01:48:47.621]  I'll pull up a calendar.
[01:48:50.402 --> 01:48:51.682]  Let's make July 4th.
[01:48:52.163 --> 01:48:53.223]  It's less than a month away.
[01:48:53.603 --> 01:49:02.986]  Let's make starting the day before, July 3rd, through the end, through the week after that, July 3rd to say July 10th.
[01:49:03.506 --> 01:49:05.787]  Let's make that national opt-out week.
[01:49:06.107 --> 01:49:08.388]  July 3rd, before the holiday, through the holiday.
[01:49:09.048 --> 01:49:11.973]  And for a week, let's make that another opt-out week.
[01:49:12.053 --> 01:49:17.402]  Not opt-out day, opt-out week, where everybody who's flying protests what's happening.
[01:49:17.663 --> 01:49:19.045]  How about we have the opt-out?
[01:49:19.085 --> 01:49:20.107]  That's what really scared him.
[01:49:20.407 --> 01:49:21.910]  That really put this on the front burner.
[01:49:23.220 --> 01:49:28.343]  Let's declare independence against the red coat pedophile TSA July 4th, Governor.
[01:49:28.503 --> 01:49:29.403]  Do you back me on it?
[01:49:29.464 --> 01:49:30.584]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:49:30.924 --> 01:49:33.306]  I won't fly that day, rest assured of that.
[01:49:33.786 --> 01:49:39.449]  I think we should carry it over to the oil companies and have one day of the year that nobody buys gas.
[01:49:39.909 --> 01:49:40.250]  I agree.
[01:49:40.290 --> 01:49:44.332]  Let's have that be July 3rd, 4th and 5th.
[01:49:45.092 --> 01:49:45.573]  Three days.
[01:49:45.613 --> 01:49:49.575]  Let's just say we're going to sit on our hind ends and not give support to any of these globalists.
[01:49:50.265 --> 01:49:50.985]  Fine with me.
[01:49:51.525 --> 01:49:55.607]  I won't fly that day and I won't buy any gas for two days.
[01:49:55.647 --> 01:49:56.107]  Whatever.
[01:50:20.754 --> 01:50:22.375]  You know, I'm open to all of it.
[01:50:22.415 --> 01:50:42.470]  You know, like I said, I can't fly because until there's a resolution to my court case, and if they rule against me, I will probably never fly again because I'm not going to subject myself to the searches that they do, and so that'll curtail my life and probably send me into retirement.
[01:50:42.630 --> 01:50:43.791]  Maybe that's what they're after.
[01:50:44.071 --> 01:50:49.335]  Yeah, in Atlanta they were smiling and giggling when you said, that's why I go to Mexico now.
[01:50:50.195 --> 01:50:52.617]  Because this is like East Germany grabbing me!
[01:50:52.637 --> 01:50:55.239]  I'm getting out of this country!
[01:50:55.539 --> 01:50:57.640]  Well, I'm not a very good Jesse Ventura imitation.
[01:50:57.961 --> 01:50:59.622]  Only he can do the real Jesse Ventura.
[01:51:00.282 --> 01:51:02.643]  What would you do with a check for $25,000?
[01:51:02.804 --> 01:51:07.926]  What if you could eliminate all of your credit card debt in 90 days and keep all of your money?
[01:51:08.127 --> 01:51:18.412]  Hi, I'm Jason Davenport, and I've just completed Zerodet100.com, a program that stops and prevents debt collections of all kinds, including debt collectors and foreclosures, with guaranteed results.
[01:51:18.653 --> 01:51:19.893]  Forget loan modifications.
[01:51:19.953 --> 01:51:26.137]  Zerodet showed me how to get the banks to pay my property taxes and insurance while stopping my foreclosure without paying one dime.
[01:51:26.297 --> 01:51:31.579]  An attorney tried to garnish my wages, but the court denied his request because of what I filed from the Zero Debt Program.
[01:51:31.739 --> 01:51:35.721]  Find out how I did this by calling Zero Debt today at 800-477-9256.
[01:51:36.041 --> 01:51:44.465]  Tell them Jason sent you and ask for the Zero Debt Special and the free bonus promotion about stopping an IRS levy and getting your money back.
[01:51:44.625 --> 01:51:46.146]  Tell them Jason sent you and call 800-477-9256.
[01:51:46.166 --> 01:51:46.206]  800-477-9256.
[01:51:46.266 --> 01:51:46.446]  That's 800-477-9256.
[01:51:46.466 --> 01:51:47.167]  Or visit www.zerodet100.com.
[01:52:01.539 --> 01:52:05.161]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:52:05.541 --> 01:52:08.542]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:52:08.802 --> 01:52:13.564]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:52:13.584 --> 01:52:19.827]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:52:19.987 --> 01:52:22.208]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:52:22.748 --> 01:52:23.028]  Tim Geithner?
[01:52:23.068 --> 01:52:23.288]  Bernanke?
[01:52:23.308 --> 01:52:23.909]  They're arsonists!
[01:52:23.929 --> 01:52:24.669]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:52:24.689 --> 01:52:26.370]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:52:41.656 --> 01:52:48.601]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:52:48.942 --> 01:52:58.289]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:53:00.222 --> 01:53:02.624]  Food prices are spiraling out of control.
[01:53:02.904 --> 01:53:09.068]  In order to survive, you will soon need to produce some or all of your own food in your backyard or small farm.
[01:53:09.288 --> 01:53:18.194]  Many years ago, sought-after radio guest Marjorie Wildcraft and her family began working to find the easiest ways to grow food for the crisis we are now facing.
[01:53:18.414 --> 01:53:22.197]  Marjorie created a video that is the fastest way to learn how to grow food.
[01:53:22.437 --> 01:53:30.162]  You'll learn the most efficient gardening methods, myths and truths of orchards and edible landscaping, effective predator protection, and even home butchering.
[01:53:30.382 --> 01:53:36.864]  Everyone is talking about Marjorie's DVD, and it's highly recommended by Jim Rawls, Jack Spurko, and Bountiful Gardens.
[01:53:37.104 --> 01:53:44.246]  Read her free reports on how to have a green thumb, making free fertilizer, and answers the question, do you need a gun to garden?
[01:53:44.486 --> 01:53:54.190]  If you want the security, savings, and freedom of food self-reliance, buy Marjorie's DVD and get the free reports at BackyardFoodProduction.com.
[01:53:54.410 --> 01:53:57.451]  Again, that's BackyardFoodProduction.com.
[01:54:03.484 --> 01:54:03.984]  Don't worry.
[01:54:04.444 --> 01:54:05.985]  This show is documented.
[01:54:06.485 --> 01:54:11.526]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:11.766 --> 01:54:15.307]  Alright, let's jam in a few phone calls for Jesse Ventura.
[01:54:15.827 --> 01:54:16.908]  Needs no introduction.
[01:54:17.128 --> 01:54:19.549]  The new book, 63 Documents the Government Doesn't Want You to Read.
[01:54:19.949 --> 01:54:23.550]  New York Times bestseller available at InfoWars.com discounted.
[01:54:23.890 --> 01:54:26.310]  Tate in Florida, you're on the air with Jesse Ventura.
[01:54:28.051 --> 01:54:31.612]  Hey guys, I am honored to be able to speak with both of you today.
[01:54:32.492 --> 01:54:33.312]  Hi, Tate.
[01:54:33.932 --> 01:54:34.552]  Hey, Governor.
[01:54:34.732 --> 01:54:47.535]  I just got done reading your book, 63 Documents the Government Doesn't Want You to Read, which I purchased at Infowars.com, so I feel incumbent that I need to thank both of you for the availability of that book.
[01:54:47.555 --> 01:54:48.535]  Well, I want to thank you, Tate.
[01:54:48.575 --> 01:54:49.255]  What's on your mind?
[01:54:50.676 --> 01:55:02.118]  Well, it gets back to what you all were talking about with Congressman Weiner and the narcissism of a lot of the politicians today, and I had a question for the Governor.
[01:55:02.819 --> 01:55:12.745]  I know he worked with two movies with Governor Schwarzenegger, Predator, and I realize that there weren't a whole lot of women on the set.
[01:55:12.785 --> 01:55:15.046]  In fact, there was only one woman character in Predator.
[01:55:15.926 --> 01:55:23.070]  But I just wanted to know if he had any, or if he saw any inclinations of Governor Schwarzenegger's
[01:55:25.109 --> 01:55:37.035]  All I can tell him is that when I worked with Arnold during Predator was when he actually flew off to Hyannisport that week and got married.
[01:55:39.276 --> 01:55:44.799]  So we go all the way back to the point where Arnold and Maria actually first got married.
[01:55:45.940 --> 01:55:50.062]  I was doing a job, I don't pay attention to Hollywood stuff like that.
[01:55:50.626 --> 01:55:51.226]  Exactly.
[01:55:51.266 --> 01:55:54.867]  I mean, he's not going to be following the gossip of what some other, you know, man's doing.
[01:55:55.207 --> 01:55:57.128]  But what do you think about the fall of Arnold?
[01:55:57.568 --> 01:55:59.688]  Well, you know, it's his own fault.
[01:56:00.509 --> 01:56:04.410]  You know, if he fathered a kid out of marriage, I don't get it.
[01:56:04.650 --> 01:56:06.750]  I mean, I'm friends with both.
[01:56:06.870 --> 01:56:08.971]  I admire Maria tremendously.
[01:56:09.631 --> 01:56:19.714]  And I can't figure out for the life of me why men in general who have steak at home will go out and eat hamburger on the road.
[01:56:22.927 --> 01:56:24.328]  Exactly, that's a good way to put it.
[01:56:24.348 --> 01:56:25.128]  I don't get it.
[01:56:25.448 --> 01:56:28.509]  I mean, Maria Shriver's gorgeous.
[01:56:28.569 --> 01:56:29.810]  She's a beautiful woman.
[01:56:30.030 --> 01:56:31.631]  She has a brilliant mind.
[01:56:33.951 --> 01:56:37.833]  I don't understand it, but then again, that's why I'm me, I guess.
[01:56:38.173 --> 01:56:40.154]  Well, sir, say hi to your wife for me.
[01:56:40.194 --> 01:56:41.755]  Your wife is also lovely as well.
[01:56:41.775 --> 01:56:48.497]  Well, thank you, but we're going on 36 years now, so I won't be trading her in soon yet.
[01:56:50.598 --> 01:56:52.159]  And you've got some great children as well.
[01:56:54.181 --> 01:56:55.603]  Anyway, any more calls, Alex?
[01:56:55.943 --> 01:56:57.145]  Hey, it's an absolute honor.
[01:56:57.545 --> 01:56:58.046]  Are you there?
[01:56:58.066 --> 01:57:02.231]  Okay, I just heard Jesse getting a little bit discouraged.
[01:57:12.939 --> 01:57:15.681]  And please, do me a favor, do not get discouraged.
[01:57:15.741 --> 01:57:16.621]  Please keep talking.
[01:57:16.961 --> 01:57:20.824]  Oh, the fact that he said he was discouraged, they're gonna come after him like piranhas now.
[01:57:20.844 --> 01:57:21.484]  Get ready, Gov.
[01:57:21.924 --> 01:57:27.507]  Alright, well, the problem is they don't find me, and so I won't be answering them anyway, so I'll never know about it.
[01:57:28.268 --> 01:57:29.068]  Okay, go ahead, Don.
[01:57:29.969 --> 01:57:37.033]  My point is, I just had a 21-year-old daughter travel back from California to Michigan.
[01:57:38.058 --> 01:57:41.861]  And she was ready to stand up to the PSA and say, no, you're not going to radiate me.
[01:57:41.981 --> 01:57:47.225]  And I'm glad she didn't have to go through the alternative, which Jesse has had to, as well as Ron Paul.
[01:57:48.286 --> 01:57:55.031]  And no, we need strong voices like you, Alex, and Jesse.
[01:57:55.511 --> 01:57:58.834]  Don't ever stop standing up, because I get discouraged.
[01:58:00.856 --> 01:58:05.359]  His discouragement basically re-empowered me because... Thanks, Alex.
[01:58:05.379 --> 01:58:06.299]  It's always a pleasure.
[01:58:27.818 --> 01:58:35.285]  Absolutely, because I know they got the interview scrambled today and I wanted to have a longer one so we could get to more calls, but you've got to go do a TV interview in Minneapolis.
[01:58:35.765 --> 01:58:37.447]  I'll say bye to you here during the break.
[01:58:37.467 --> 01:58:38.888]  We'll be right back with the rest of your calls.
[01:58:41.791 --> 01:58:43.092]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:43.232 --> 01:58:46.395]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.277 --> 01:58:52.779]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:58:52.999 --> 01:58:58.044]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:58:58.304 --> 01:58:59.685]  Saving means to make money.
[01:58:59.846 --> 01:59:08.634]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:59:09.355 --> 01:59:16.480]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:59:16.900 --> 01:59:24.505]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:59:24.905 --> 01:59:29.828]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:59:30.128 --> 01:59:32.289]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:59:35.071 --> 01:59:37.992]  Or see Calvin on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[01:59:38.273 --> 01:59:40.594]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:59:41.294 --> 01:59:46.296]  Or see Calvin on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[01:59:53.219 --> 01:59:55.140]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:55.600 --> 01:59:58.382]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:04.929 --> 02:00:09.111]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:09.752 --> 02:00:10.572]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.333 --> 02:00:12.293]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.893 --> 02:00:16.515]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.076 --> 02:00:21.198]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.739 --> 02:00:26.321]  I was just talking to Viterre during the break, and, uh...
[02:00:28.769 --> 02:00:30.470]  They've been calling me for almost two weeks.
[02:00:30.490 --> 02:00:35.491]  My phone was screwed up for a few days and I don't get the calls and I don't ever handle it.
[02:00:36.272 --> 02:00:37.212]  But I need to call them.
[02:00:37.232 --> 02:00:40.153]  I didn't know the TV show Conspiracy Theory picked up for a third season.
[02:00:40.173 --> 02:00:42.014]  I think that's breaking news here.
[02:00:42.794 --> 02:00:45.135]  But Ventura doesn't even know if he's going to be involved in it.
[02:00:46.172 --> 02:00:48.334]  They've actually... I'm not going to get into the whole thing.
[02:00:48.755 --> 02:00:50.897]  I particularly don't want to do the show, if you want to get honest.
[02:00:51.318 --> 02:00:54.401]  Folks think that, you know, doing national TV is a big deal.
[02:00:55.262 --> 02:00:57.504]  And if it's not hardcore issues, it's not.
[02:00:57.985 --> 02:01:05.853]  If it's the search for Easter bunnies, the search for chupacabras, the search for wolf men and ghosts, I'm not doing it.
[02:01:06.678 --> 02:01:07.658]  And Ventura's not either.
[02:01:07.678 --> 02:01:08.459]  They just told me that.
[02:01:09.019 --> 02:01:10.699]  And that looks like the way they want it to go.
[02:01:11.239 --> 02:01:13.080]  And that's what the establishment does.
[02:01:13.160 --> 02:01:14.660]  It got record ratings first season.
[02:01:14.680 --> 02:01:16.241]  They put it in the dead zone on Fridays.
[02:01:16.681 --> 02:01:18.941]  They banned the re-air of the FEMA Camp show.
[02:01:19.902 --> 02:01:23.583]  And if you just join us, we just had Jesse Ventura on, former Minnesota governor.
[02:01:23.603 --> 02:01:26.803]  He was going to be on for an hour, but they booked him too much.
[02:01:26.964 --> 02:01:28.244]  And that's why he was in a grumpy mood.
[02:01:30.144 --> 02:01:33.805]  You can say what you want about Jesse Ventura, but he's a real guy.
[02:01:34.706 --> 02:01:35.566]  He's the real deal.
[02:01:36.936 --> 02:01:43.278]  I've seen people sit around and make jokes about, you know, Jesse Ventura's New World Order, or he's that.
[02:01:43.638 --> 02:01:45.078]  No, he's definitely the real deal.
[02:01:45.638 --> 02:01:55.881]  He definitely believes what he says, says what he means, and I hope the season gets picked back up, but it got more hardcore in the second season, and the system panicked.
[02:01:55.941 --> 02:02:04.763]  It was successful monetarily, it was successful in the ratings, very successful in the reason I was involved in the consultant in the mission, and the network
[02:02:08.208 --> 02:02:11.130]  Because Ventura was just talking about it, so now I can.
[02:02:11.151 --> 02:02:13.212]  That's kind of how it works as a journalist.
[02:02:13.332 --> 02:02:17.055]  Other sources tell you something, but it's off-record, then you don't get into it.
[02:02:17.336 --> 02:02:21.499]  But then when another source tells you something and it's not off-record, then you can talk about it from that source.
[02:02:22.100 --> 02:02:24.782]  So that's why I specifically brought that up during some of the breaks with him.
[02:02:27.642 --> 02:02:34.909]  That's how they've always, the system has always seen, quote, conspiracy theories questioning government as palatable.
[02:02:35.349 --> 02:02:41.354]  As long as you mix, the Federal Reserve is private, and there's a world government forming, and it's run by chupacabras.
[02:02:41.795 --> 02:02:46.159]  And I'm not criticizing people that talk about everything, look at everything.
[02:02:46.199 --> 02:02:48.221]  The world is a place of mystery.
[02:02:49.400 --> 02:02:56.385]  They've got major newspapers reporting on Google, Hubble telescope maps, showing it looks like a human base.
[02:02:56.425 --> 02:02:59.767]  It looks like a NASA moon model base I've seen.
[02:03:00.848 --> 02:03:01.448]  That's there.
[02:03:02.189 --> 02:03:12.796]  I mean, if you'd have told somebody 300 years ago they're going to have atomic weapons, and there's little invisible things you can't see, that when you bounce them together can blow up whole cities, folks would think you were nuts.
[02:03:13.456 --> 02:03:17.319]  So I always question everything, and I think anything could be possible.
[02:03:17.719 --> 02:03:18.260]  It's just that
[02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:36.291]  I only cover what I can prove because I know for a fact that the Royals, I've seen a lot of reports of this over the years, were involved in human flesh life extension therapies and pituitary gland, but oh it was out of cadavers, yeah right.
[02:03:36.672 --> 02:03:42.495]  Then you have the mail today, Daily Mail, British royalty died on human flesh, but don't worry it was 300 years ago.
[02:03:43.836 --> 02:03:44.156]  Whatever.
[02:03:45.984 --> 02:03:59.252]  I'm gonna come back and go to your calls, and I'm sorry I've sweeped out the callers earlier to just go to calls for Ventura, and now we didn't even get to a lot of those calls because I thought we had him for an hour, but then he explained to me that he was late so he had to go, so he called in early.
[02:04:00.112 --> 02:04:09.318]  But we're gonna be talking to Dustin, Tim, Kathy, Josh, Jeff, and others on the other side of this break.
[02:04:10.447 --> 02:04:11.568]  Here on the third hour today.
[02:04:12.309 --> 02:04:21.636]  We've got a lot of other important news as well, but we'll try to rapid-fire go through your calls, so be ready when I go to you, as we're going to get you up on the air.
[02:04:22.817 --> 02:04:29.902]  Some of the most important news I want to get to, because I promise to get to this in the first hour after we take a bunch of your calls, is the E. coli outbreak.
[02:04:29.942 --> 02:04:31.644]  Bean sprouts may not be to blame.
[02:04:33.511 --> 02:04:37.995]  Now in Dryden, Virginia, girl dead from E. coli, brother in stable condition.
[02:04:39.016 --> 02:04:46.382]  This is being done worldwide as they try to move to bring in government regulations and control over local farms and ranches and agriculture.
[02:04:47.283 --> 02:04:54.149]  But it's clearly genetically engineered and we've seen government do this in the past when they're trying to seize control of the food supplies.
[02:04:54.169 --> 02:04:55.631]  We'll talk about that as well.
[02:04:55.671 --> 02:04:56.491]  Your calls are straight ahead.
[02:04:56.511 --> 02:04:56.912]  Stay with us.
[02:05:00.111 --> 02:05:04.354]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:05:04.674 --> 02:05:05.275]  Number one.
[02:05:05.575 --> 02:05:08.737]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:09.018 --> 02:05:09.578]  Number two.
[02:05:09.878 --> 02:05:14.422]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:05:14.762 --> 02:05:15.202]  It's true.
[02:05:15.502 --> 02:05:20.066]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:20.386 --> 02:05:20.926]  Number three.
[02:05:21.207 --> 02:05:24.489]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:05:24.789 --> 02:05:28.492]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:05:28.692 --> 02:05:29.233]  Number 4.
[02:05:29.493 --> 02:05:31.856]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:05:32.256 --> 02:05:35.640]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:05:35.940 --> 02:05:36.140]  Number 5.
[02:05:36.721 --> 02:05:40.645]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:05:40.866 --> 02:05:45.631]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:05:45.911 --> 02:05:49.937]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[02:07:01.445 --> 02:07:05.068]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:05.408 --> 02:07:13.534]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:07:14.275 --> 02:07:18.318]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:07:18.918 --> 02:07:29.727]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:07:30.347 --> 02:07:39.350]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:39.870 --> 02:07:44.912]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:07:45.292 --> 02:07:52.475]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:52.775 --> 02:07:55.176]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:08:05.049 --> 02:08:09.254]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:08:09.875 --> 02:08:10.696]  You want answers?
[02:08:11.477 --> 02:08:12.438]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:12.999 --> 02:08:16.643]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:17.204 --> 02:08:21.268]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:22.817 --> 02:08:27.980]  Okay, we're eight minutes into the third and final hour of the official transmission.
[02:08:28.920 --> 02:08:40.226]  Occasionally, I go into the fourth hour, which is internet-only at InfoWars.com, but I'm getting very close to launching my daily TV show, then the fourth hour will cease to be.
[02:08:40.706 --> 02:08:44.008]  It's still up on the satellite, they just repeat the first hour in the, um...
[02:08:45.319 --> 02:09:10.035]  in the fourth hour but that gets confusing for some stations so the problem is I love talk radio I love information and I'm so long winded as you know even though I got rid of that seat for like 14 years I guess 13 years I did three hours and then I greedily added a fourth hour for two years and then I got rid of it again so that's what's happening to explain
[02:09:11.820 --> 02:09:12.721]  What's going on there?
[02:09:12.901 --> 02:09:17.825]  And it also gives us flexibility that sometimes we go into the fourth hour because sometimes we have some big breaking news.
[02:09:19.486 --> 02:09:27.452]  And of course I'm known to go five, six, seven hours if there's big breaking news and just continue sitting here in the studio because this is all I think about anyways.
[02:09:28.734 --> 02:09:40.283]  In fact, my biggest problem is I'm not as articulate verbally as I am mentally, as we all are, when I'm just sitting there and thinking and looking at all the connections and history and ways to defeat this system.
[02:09:41.462 --> 02:09:45.423]  Now, I'm going to go to your calls here, and then I'm going to get into officials.
[02:09:46.603 --> 02:09:50.664]  Admit that they're bombing Qaddafi's compound again, blew up the TV station.
[02:09:50.944 --> 02:09:53.285]  This is the war that would last days, not weeks.
[02:09:53.345 --> 02:09:56.085]  Now it's lasted months, and they say it's going to go into next year now.
[02:09:57.125 --> 02:10:01.066]  They'll be bombing it in ten years if he holds out, because it's not a war.
[02:10:01.166 --> 02:10:02.607]  It's a kinetic action.
[02:10:04.127 --> 02:10:07.328]  Syria warns of more marches on Israeli border.
[02:10:07.848 --> 02:10:08.768]  You can say what you want.
[02:10:09.742 --> 02:10:16.964]  And about either side, but those Palestinians, unarmed, marching into machine gun fire, that's courage.
[02:10:18.065 --> 02:10:19.965]  I see our media calling them cowards.
[02:10:21.126 --> 02:10:25.107]  Marching up a hill, unarmed, to be killed, are cowards?
[02:10:26.987 --> 02:10:30.028]  And saying, well, they're funded by the Syrian government.
[02:10:30.549 --> 02:10:33.750]  Regardless, they shouldn't be mowed down.
[02:10:34.210 --> 02:10:34.850]  Arrest them.
[02:10:36.195 --> 02:10:38.177]  I mean, is this going to be exported here?
[02:10:38.598 --> 02:10:41.821]  That if you protest something and the police are just going to shoot you?
[02:10:41.921 --> 02:10:43.262]  I guess in a lot of cases they do.
[02:10:43.302 --> 02:10:49.789]  If you're a Red Sox fan and walk out of a bar and they see you get off the street and you say, okay, and they shoot you from three feet away in the head with a rubber bullet.
[02:10:49.809 --> 02:10:51.811]  The cops said, hey, good killing.
[02:10:52.352 --> 02:10:52.952]  She deserves it.
[02:10:53.132 --> 02:10:53.853]  Didn't move quick enough.
[02:10:54.274 --> 02:10:55.515]  So I guess that's the new system.
[02:10:55.875 --> 02:10:59.058]  I saw two articles today about taser deaths in the last day.
[02:10:59.997 --> 02:11:03.181]  And they've upped the power of the tasers, and people are dying all the time.
[02:11:03.641 --> 02:11:06.044]  Young people are dying, not just old guys that have heart attacks.
[02:11:06.905 --> 02:11:10.148]  And now they say, you didn't jump quick enough when I said, give me your driver's license.
[02:11:10.208 --> 02:11:11.690]  I'm gonna punish you with this.
[02:11:13.572 --> 02:11:16.115]  They're just, I'm ranting, I said I'd go to your calls.
[02:11:16.736 --> 02:11:21.341]  It's just, as a human being, watching those people be mowed down upsets me.
[02:11:25.114 --> 02:11:26.895]  But our media says they're cowards and deserve it.
[02:11:26.915 --> 02:11:27.716]  They're dehumanized.
[02:11:27.896 --> 02:11:29.377]  Okay, well, we're going to be dehumanized next.
[02:11:29.397 --> 02:11:30.118]  That's all I'm saying.
[02:11:32.240 --> 02:11:38.405]  I remember those images of the Nazis lining up Jews in Germany at pits and shooting them in the back of the head and throwing them in there.
[02:11:42.008 --> 02:11:42.668]  That's upsetting.
[02:11:44.069 --> 02:11:49.814]  That's upsetting watching those folks get mowed down, but I guess we're landing free on the brave.
[02:11:52.162 --> 02:11:54.103]  World War III is getting geared up to be started.
[02:11:54.123 --> 02:11:55.324]  There are all these proxy wars.
[02:11:56.285 --> 02:12:09.855]  The Depression's full on, but the mainstream media tells us we're having a big recovery, and Weiner didn't send those photos, and John Edwards didn't have that mistress, and Bill Clinton didn't have sex with that woman, and the bankers wouldn't tell us where the money went, but they said it wasn't the foreign banks.
[02:12:10.175 --> 02:12:17.361]  Turns out over 70% was the foreign banks that own around America, but again, I suggest sit down and shut up and believe whatever I'm told.
[02:12:17.741 --> 02:12:19.462]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dustin in Utah.
[02:12:19.482 --> 02:12:20.303]  Dustin, you're on the air.
[02:12:21.428 --> 02:12:22.529]  Alex, how you doing, man?
[02:12:22.569 --> 02:12:25.130]  First of all, I want to say I love you, love your show, love what you're doing.
[02:12:25.170 --> 02:12:26.370]  I'm honored to be on the show.
[02:12:26.390 --> 02:12:27.031]  Well, thank you.
[02:12:27.091 --> 02:12:27.851]  Just say dittos.
[02:12:27.871 --> 02:12:31.533]  I think we should go with the Limbaugh deal because everybody takes a lot of time thanking me.
[02:12:31.553 --> 02:12:36.035]  And I want to thank you as a listener for caring and being involved and putting up with me, Dustin.
[02:12:37.236 --> 02:12:37.576]  All right.
[02:12:37.616 --> 02:12:40.197]  Well, I have a civil liberties question for you.
[02:12:41.138 --> 02:12:44.899]  I've been involved in a civil liberties fight for about three years now.
[02:12:45.140 --> 02:12:47.121]  I'm going to quickly just briefly blow through it.
[02:12:47.161 --> 02:12:49.942]  And what they did was through
[02:12:50.390 --> 02:13:05.443]  Through this Patriot Act, through just a tip from an anonymous person, the police came to my house, put a GPS tracking device on my vehicle, and followed me around for six months without an authorization or a warrant signed by a judge.
[02:13:06.615 --> 02:13:08.857]  They saw that I went to a friend's house quite a bit.
[02:13:08.877 --> 02:13:14.262]  They raided him while he was out of town at work, and his seven-month pregnant girlfriend was home alone.
[02:13:14.282 --> 02:13:16.384]  Yeah, that happens very often.
[02:13:16.724 --> 02:13:21.168]  Federal court has ruled they can put GPS on your car with no warrant.
[02:13:21.208 --> 02:13:22.088]  That's your property.
[02:13:22.188 --> 02:13:24.931]  Person, place, papers, effects, property.
[02:13:24.951 --> 02:13:27.213]  You know, read the Fourth Amendment.
[02:13:27.713 --> 02:13:31.856]  In fact, we'll put the Fourth Amendment on screen so I can read it exactly, just please.
[02:13:32.757 --> 02:13:33.698]  It's totally illegal.
[02:13:33.758 --> 02:13:34.959]  It's what the Stasi did.
[02:13:34.999 --> 02:13:43.448]  The Stasi would put radioactive isotopes on your floor mat so they could literally, with a special light, follow where you've gone.
[02:13:44.288 --> 02:13:46.591]  It's the same thing the Stasi did, just with more high tech.
[02:13:47.552 --> 02:13:49.313]  And I see these reports all over the country.
[02:13:50.074 --> 02:13:56.502]  Where people take the device off, and then the FBI comes and demands it back, and they're tracking our phones.
[02:13:57.142 --> 02:13:58.944]  But you notice what happened, an anonymous tip.
[02:13:59.004 --> 02:14:08.515]  They have got an endless army of crackhead, meth-head, that's who they use, convicted felons, who will walk up to any house, and the cops don't care that they're lying, and say,
[02:14:09.608 --> 02:14:14.589]  It's like a dog that alerts because it gets given biscuits to alert, to falsely alert.
[02:14:14.629 --> 02:14:23.291]  Most of these police dogs are trained to false alert and every car they put the dog on, oops, sorry, shows drugs at the checkpoint since you said you wouldn't let us search without a warrant.
[02:14:23.731 --> 02:14:30.152]  Flash here, who, you know, is overweight, wants another biscuit, so he, you know, he alerts and barks.
[02:14:30.633 --> 02:14:34.293]  That's happened to me a couple times when I said, no, you're not going to search without a warrant.
[02:14:34.413 --> 02:14:36.454]  Oh, well, Flash says he smells something.
[02:14:36.494 --> 02:14:37.334]  I'm like, yeah, right.
[02:14:37.574 --> 02:14:39.014]  You better not plant something, buddy.
[02:14:39.254 --> 02:14:40.635]  I don't use any of your products.
[02:14:41.155 --> 02:14:41.495]  Okay?
[02:14:42.135 --> 02:14:44.476]  And so, yes, that's the new situation.
[02:14:44.496 --> 02:14:45.936]  Of course, why even do that?
[02:14:45.996 --> 02:14:48.077]  Now they just pull you over and take the cash out of your wallet.
[02:14:48.117 --> 02:14:49.897]  In Dallas, they admitted, nobody got in trouble.
[02:14:50.117 --> 02:14:54.758]  They pulled over thousands of cars, threw bags of chalk in the back, took the cars, saying it was cocaine.
[02:14:54.998 --> 02:14:56.539]  That's how America rolls.
[02:14:56.559 --> 02:14:59.079]  I mean, that's all admitted four years ago, and they still do it.
[02:14:59.119 --> 02:15:01.400]  It's like, yeah, we do it, and we frame you, and that's how.
[02:15:01.580 --> 02:15:05.981]  And then the crime lab would certify the chalk as cocaine.
[02:15:06.701 --> 02:15:10.962]  Okay, so that's, again, I'm anti-police now, because I don't want them planting shock on me.
[02:15:11.122 --> 02:15:11.842]  Well, they're doing it.
[02:15:12.162 --> 02:15:14.383]  It's admitted, and they go, well, that's pro-law enforcement.
[02:15:14.623 --> 02:15:15.303]  We frame you.
[02:15:15.743 --> 02:15:19.664]  But, so your friend gets raided because you went to his house a lot.
[02:15:20.044 --> 02:15:20.904]  And, yeah, that's how they work.
[02:15:20.924 --> 02:15:23.645]  They have the crackhead come up and go, that's the house.
[02:15:23.965 --> 02:15:24.825]  I bought it in there.
[02:15:25.225 --> 02:15:27.845]  And then they get to put the GPS on your car.
[02:15:27.885 --> 02:15:28.986]  So, I'm sorry, Dustin.
[02:15:29.206 --> 02:15:30.226]  Tell me more about your case.
[02:15:31.383 --> 02:15:43.693]  Um, well, actually, what has happened is there's a long-standing statute in the Utah Constitution that says in order to electronically, with an electronic device, follow someone around, you have to have an authorization signed by a judge or a warrant signed by a judge.
[02:15:44.173 --> 02:15:56.623]  If it's on private property, well, it was on my private property, and, um, I'm on my third attorney now, and it's, uh, it's, the judge, this is what the judge said to me at my motion hearing, he said, on the issue of the GPS tracking device,
[02:15:57.005 --> 02:16:04.410]  The placement of the GPS tracking device on your vehicle without authorization or warrant was unlawful, but that didn't violate your Fourth Amendment rights.
[02:16:05.150 --> 02:16:07.812]  So he admitted that it was unlawful what the police did to me.
[02:16:08.212 --> 02:16:12.375]  It was against Longstand and the Utah Statute, but he didn't allow it to happen anyway.
[02:16:12.415 --> 02:16:18.099]  So I was just like, so do I take responsibility for these lawmen's unlawful actions?
[02:16:18.755 --> 02:16:28.119]  But anyway, what I figured out was, through this involuntary education in the Constitution... But that's what Ventura talked about last night.
[02:16:28.439 --> 02:16:31.980]  Congress is exempt from almost every law that they put on us.
[02:16:32.060 --> 02:16:34.061]  This is a criminal government.
[02:16:34.441 --> 02:16:36.582]  For people to go, why would the government ship the drugs in?
[02:16:36.622 --> 02:16:37.423]  To launder the money?
[02:16:38.385 --> 02:16:42.128]  Then the big launder banks on record are the biggest owners of the private prisons.
[02:16:42.609 --> 02:16:50.135]  Then, when you, the end user, buy their drugs, they then put you in their private prison working for 25 cents an hour.
[02:16:50.195 --> 02:16:51.537]  It's pure genius.
[02:16:52.898 --> 02:16:53.158]  It is.
[02:16:53.238 --> 02:16:54.459]  It's a racket.
[02:16:54.659 --> 02:16:58.042]  The 2nd District Court in Utah is the biggest racket in northern Utah.
[02:16:58.603 --> 02:17:02.266]  And this involuntary education has really taught me a lot of things.
[02:17:02.899 --> 02:17:05.501]  And Alex, I've found their Achilles heel.
[02:17:06.521 --> 02:17:14.486]  What I have, I have some intellectual properties that I don't only feel that are essential to the revolution, I feel they are key to the revolution.
[02:17:15.207 --> 02:17:22.471]  And basically what I have here is I'm the registered federal trademark holder of the slogan, Canada's Activist.
[02:17:22.551 --> 02:17:25.913]  I've developed a hemp clothing line called Canada's Activist.
[02:17:27.631 --> 02:17:30.212]  It's the only thing that I can do to fight for my rights at this point.
[02:17:30.252 --> 02:17:38.755]  I mean, I've lost my home, I've lost my cars, everything of value that I've ever had, I've thrown right at this fight for my freedom and our rights.
[02:17:39.795 --> 02:17:55.440]  And I found out that all these big oil companies, all these big pharmaceutical companies, all these big timber companies, all these other companies, they're all scared of one seed, and it's the hemp seed, because it grows in 50 different states like a weed,
[02:17:56.030 --> 02:18:00.114]  And if we were to utilize it for... No, it grows everywhere.
[02:18:00.134 --> 02:18:01.455]  It's better than cotton.
[02:18:01.775 --> 02:18:03.277]  You can make great oil out of it.
[02:18:05.158 --> 02:18:09.062]  It's one of the main crops that built this country, even more than cotton or tobacco.
[02:18:09.082 --> 02:18:13.246]  And in the 1930s, Dow Chemical in DuPont openly lobbied.
[02:18:14.349 --> 02:18:16.650]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:18:40.154 --> 02:18:46.621]  I was wondering, you know, how about you organize, like, a money bomb to form, like, a mass protest at, like, the Jefferson Memorial?
[02:18:46.681 --> 02:18:49.564]  You know, I'm not, like, trying to be a provocateur or anything, you know.
[02:18:49.644 --> 02:18:52.667]  I'm just, you know, like, that's what we need to see, you know.
[02:18:52.687 --> 02:18:53.969]  Form a money bomb?
[02:18:53.989 --> 02:18:55.751]  Well, we wouldn't really need money for that.
[02:18:57.272 --> 02:19:00.716]  Well, you know, the way I see it, you know, you could use the funds for it to, like,
[02:19:01.618 --> 02:19:04.982]  Shuttle buses and bringing people from all over the United States, you know?
[02:19:05.042 --> 02:19:05.663]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:19:05.743 --> 02:19:09.068]  I'm not saying it's a bad idea, but there are better ideas.
[02:19:09.468 --> 02:19:15.957]  They have protests every single day all over DC, sometimes hundreds of thousands, and the media ignores it.
[02:19:16.438 --> 02:19:17.599]  Only something novel
[02:19:18.851 --> 02:19:21.692]  Well I guess that means we just need to camp out in front of the White House then.
[02:19:46.116 --> 02:19:48.157]  People used to do that, but they don't allow that now.
[02:19:48.597 --> 02:19:51.258]  You're not in America anymore, Camper.
[02:19:51.679 --> 02:19:53.920]  What, you think you're going to sit out front of your White House?
[02:19:54.700 --> 02:19:58.101]  You're here to do one thing, provide slave labor for the bankers.
[02:19:58.582 --> 02:19:58.962]  Period.
[02:20:00.489 --> 02:20:01.749]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:20:01.789 --> 02:20:07.151]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:20:07.391 --> 02:20:12.013]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:20:12.393 --> 02:20:12.793]  It's true.
[02:20:12.873 --> 02:20:17.435]  Seeds did not perform even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:20:17.975 --> 02:20:22.658]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:20:23.199 --> 02:20:25.120]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.

[02:22:01.074 --> 02:22:06.416]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:22:06.657 --> 02:22:11.279]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:22:11.679 --> 02:22:12.079]  It's true.
[02:22:12.159 --> 02:22:16.702]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:22:17.242 --> 02:22:21.945]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:22:22.466 --> 02:22:24.387]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[02:22:24.787 --> 02:22:29.390]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:22:29.590 --> 02:22:30.491]  And here's the best part.
[02:22:30.711 --> 02:22:33.473]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:22:33.773 --> 02:22:37.075]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:22:37.396 --> 02:22:40.237]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:22:40.578 --> 02:22:42.479]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.

[02:22:48.743 --> 02:22:51.065]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:22:51.605 --> 02:22:56.108]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:22:56.428 --> 02:22:58.810]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:23:01.522 --> 02:23:03.204]  Are you still a traditional smoker?

[02:23:55.696 --> 02:23:58.678]  Lecig e-cigarettes for today's modern smoker.
[02:24:06.122 --> 02:24:08.284]  They railed against the crown.
[02:24:08.304 --> 02:24:10.785]  They railed against the crown.
[02:24:11.305 --> 02:24:12.726]  Another ragtag band.
[02:24:12.746 --> 02:24:13.387]  Another ragtag band.
[02:24:13.407 --> 02:24:14.147]  Declaring independence.
[02:24:14.587 --> 02:24:15.708]  Declaring independence.
[02:24:18.097 --> 02:24:20.519]  And FEMA teaches police nationwide.
[02:24:20.539 --> 02:24:30.405]  We have the manuals and the video of them teaching them that the Founding Fathers were bad, and America is bad, and that the New World Order is good.
[02:24:31.365 --> 02:24:32.686]  That's what they teach the police.
[02:24:33.206 --> 02:24:34.167]  It is treason.
[02:24:35.548 --> 02:24:36.908]  This is what happens to cultures.
[02:24:36.948 --> 02:24:37.809]  They get taken over.
[02:24:38.249 --> 02:24:39.690]  But we haven't been taken over militarily.
[02:24:39.710 --> 02:24:40.951]  We've been taken over financially.
[02:24:41.251 --> 02:24:44.313]  But the system knows it's fraudulent, and they know that we're waking up.
[02:24:45.822 --> 02:24:49.447]  And so, they are moving to put the control grid in place to block us.
[02:24:49.487 --> 02:24:53.112]  Let's continue with your calls, Kathy, Jeff, Josh, and many others.
[02:24:53.132 --> 02:24:58.478]  Got some news on the whole E. coli outbreak, the economy coming up towards the end of the hour.
[02:24:59.660 --> 02:25:02.724]  Some more breaking Wiener news in Wienergate.
[02:25:05.009 --> 02:25:06.591]  But I do want to just put a plug in here.
[02:25:07.072 --> 02:25:08.314]  We're launching something new.
[02:25:08.394 --> 02:25:08.795]  Well, you know what?
[02:25:08.855 --> 02:25:09.315]  I'll do it.
[02:25:09.416 --> 02:25:11.058]  I'll do it at the start of the next segment.
[02:25:11.579 --> 02:25:12.140]  That'll be better.
[02:25:12.180 --> 02:25:15.284]  But just a key announcement coming up at the start of the next segment.
[02:25:15.545 --> 02:25:16.907]  Kathy in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:25:16.947 --> 02:25:17.488]  Thank you for holding.
[02:25:18.055 --> 02:25:19.096]  Yes, hi Alex.
[02:25:19.536 --> 02:25:29.081]  As you know, I'm sure the Texas Senate has just recently voted to cut public teachers' pay and put them on non-paid furloughs.
[02:25:29.702 --> 02:25:33.384]  And I'm sure the House will support this since we have Dewhurst and Perry there.
[02:25:33.964 --> 02:25:42.809]  My question is, since Texas instituted the lottery system and the proceeds were supposed to go to fund education, where's the money?
[02:25:43.069 --> 02:25:45.551]  And how do we find out where the money is?
[02:25:45.891 --> 02:25:49.393]  Well, the Texas Lottery has actually gotten in trouble quite a few times.
[02:25:49.413 --> 02:25:50.434]  There's a long history of that.
[02:25:50.474 --> 02:25:57.099]  But all over the country, different lotteries are always connected in with the goodfellas, if you know what I mean.
[02:25:58.059 --> 02:26:04.443]  And casinos are going in everywhere, and they always push how great they are for economies.
[02:26:05.164 --> 02:26:09.607]  People think Las Vegas is great, or they think the area... I mean, I've been around these places.
[02:26:10.127 --> 02:26:10.628]  I've seen it.
[02:26:10.688 --> 02:26:14.950]  The prostitutes, the unhappy people, the folks that are spending, you know, their kids.
[02:26:16.171 --> 02:26:40.894]  uh... college fund to their own retirement i mean i just uh... gambling is for suckers and is for losers and i mean it's one thing if you want to play a game of poker with your buddies and you know bet quarters or something i've done that that's fun to make it interesting or if you want to bet twenty bucks with your buddy on a football game that's one thing but just this whole culture of big giant buildings and and and and and people and they're getting scammed uh... it
[02:26:41.454 --> 02:26:42.774]  Really makes me want to throw up.
[02:26:43.815 --> 02:26:46.695]  And yeah, it was supposed to be for Texas education, but here's the deal.
[02:26:47.275 --> 02:26:49.536]  They're slashing police, fire.
[02:26:50.296 --> 02:26:52.256]  I mean, it's all over the news this week.
[02:26:52.496 --> 02:26:54.977]  Some departments are slashing 60% of their deputies.
[02:26:55.497 --> 02:26:56.797]  Crime is exploding.
[02:26:57.578 --> 02:27:00.678]  While the government moves to not let citizens have guns to protect themselves.
[02:27:01.318 --> 02:27:02.279]  I mean, this is incredible.
[02:27:04.199 --> 02:27:09.741]  They're cutting the teachers' pay, they're doing all of this, claiming it'll fix the deficits, it'll fix the budgets.
[02:27:10.261 --> 02:27:10.581]  No!
[02:27:11.522 --> 02:27:25.607]  Nothing is going to be fixed until we get rid of the fractional reserve banking system and say no to the derivatives, too big to fail fraud that these private banks induced government to sign on to and to underwrite.
[02:27:28.448 --> 02:27:31.850]  It is a huge fleecing that's going on all over the country.
[02:27:31.870 --> 02:27:34.052]  People talk about Rick Perry made Texas great.
[02:27:34.512 --> 02:27:37.094]  No, Rick Perry has made Texas worse.
[02:27:37.114 --> 02:27:40.817]  It's just that Texas is better than other states because it did have the lowest tax rates in the country.
[02:27:40.837 --> 02:27:46.721]  I guess there's a few states that might be on par, but not the resources or the amount of people.
[02:27:46.741 --> 02:27:49.022]  Now I'm ranting about this, all the data.
[02:27:49.523 --> 02:27:51.604]  Perry got the franchise tax passed.
[02:27:51.864 --> 02:27:53.866]  That's an income tax on business owners.
[02:27:54.006 --> 02:27:54.566]  It's huge.
[02:27:54.666 --> 02:27:55.487]  I have to pay it every year.
[02:27:56.047 --> 02:28:03.771]  He got the hospital district tax passed so Travis County can take my money and spend it for taxpayer-funded abortions.
[02:28:04.251 --> 02:28:10.094]  He was for forced inoculations of girls with a drug they knew, Gardasil, that was killing people.
[02:28:10.474 --> 02:28:13.675]  But by him mandating it, he then gave it government protection for liability.
[02:28:14.295 --> 02:28:16.136]  I mean, the guy was for the NAFTA highways.
[02:28:16.176 --> 02:28:17.317]  The guy is a monster.
[02:28:17.577 --> 02:28:21.399]  And notice, he hasn't put on the special session, though he said he supported it.
[02:28:22.335 --> 02:28:26.360]  He hasn't put, on the special session, the anti-groping bill.
[02:28:27.121 --> 02:28:32.027]  As I predicted, no matter how much pressure, we need to put more on him, but it's just incredible.
[02:28:32.548 --> 02:28:38.756]  Because, again, he walks around with a cowboy hat and goes, yeah, I'm a real Texan boy, yeah boy!
[02:28:39.417 --> 02:28:40.238]  But he's the opposite.
[02:28:41.817 --> 02:28:46.799]  He needs to be nailed to a post and he needs to be forced to say where the money has gone.
[02:28:46.819 --> 02:28:52.002]  I mean, if he's shuttling it up to Las Vegas, up to those people, alright, we need to know that.
[02:28:52.362 --> 02:28:56.984]  If it's not, if it's not being put in the Texas Education Fund, we need to know what he's done with it.
[02:28:58.407 --> 02:29:05.252]  Well, look, the people have been sold on lotteries and casinos, and the last 20 years, is America better?
[02:29:05.292 --> 02:29:06.373]  No, America's falling apart.
[02:29:06.653 --> 02:29:08.355]  Our roads are falling apart, but don't worry!
[02:29:09.275 --> 02:29:24.967]  If I've got to get gas on a Friday night, folks, all the poor people are in there with their paycheck cashed, and I'll watch them while I'm pumping my gas, and they'll buy five, six lottery tickets, scratch off, they'll go outside, they'll scratch them off, they'll run back in,
[02:29:25.748 --> 02:29:34.230]  They'll buy more, and then those don't work, and they run back in, and they get more, and their poor wife's in the car with her kids with snot all over their face.
[02:29:34.250 --> 02:29:38.531]  You know, just wanting... Don't worry, I'll get you some McDonald's GMO, sweetie.
[02:29:38.991 --> 02:29:39.811]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:40.392 --> 02:29:42.832]  Yep, land of the brainwashed, brain-dead zombie.
[02:29:43.372 --> 02:29:45.773]  We can revive the Republic like the Phoenix.
[02:29:46.453 --> 02:29:50.054]  Stay aware of this key announcement straight ahead, and your phone calls.
[02:29:50.554 --> 02:29:51.454]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.934 --> 02:29:53.435]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.449 --> 02:29:57.250]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.432 --> 02:30:05.054]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:30:05.454 --> 02:30:08.456]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:30:08.696 --> 02:30:13.498]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:30:13.858 --> 02:30:19.721]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:30:19.881 --> 02:30:22.122]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:30:22.662 --> 02:30:23.823]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:30:23.843 --> 02:30:24.583]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:30:24.603 --> 02:30:26.284]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:30:41.573 --> 02:30:45.496]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[02:30:45.937 --> 02:30:48.459]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:30:48.839 --> 02:30:57.967]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:30:59.929 --> 02:31:04.152]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:04.472 --> 02:31:05.072]  Number 1.
[02:31:05.392 --> 02:31:08.534]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:08.815 --> 02:31:09.375]  Number 2.
[02:31:09.675 --> 02:31:14.218]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:14.558 --> 02:31:14.999]  It's true.
[02:31:15.299 --> 02:31:19.862]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:20.182 --> 02:31:20.722]  Number 3.
[02:31:21.002 --> 02:31:24.284]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:24.585 --> 02:31:28.287]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:28.487 --> 02:31:29.048]  Number 4.
[02:31:29.288 --> 02:31:31.650]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:32.050 --> 02:31:35.434]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:35.734 --> 02:31:36.274]  Number 5.
[02:31:36.515 --> 02:31:40.438]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:31:40.658 --> 02:31:45.423]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:33:11.437 --> 02:33:18.061]  My daughter likes that song we just used for bumper music called Tarzan's Boy.
[02:33:18.081 --> 02:33:20.242]  Is that what that song's called?
[02:33:21.983 --> 02:33:22.464]  What's it called?
[02:33:23.956 --> 02:33:24.756]  Tarzan Boy.
[02:33:24.776 --> 02:33:27.317]  I can never hear what they say.
[02:33:27.337 --> 02:33:28.818]  That's why I'm always like, eh, eh.
[02:33:29.578 --> 02:33:32.839]  I think I'm half deaf, but also the microphone doesn't pick up too good.
[02:33:33.719 --> 02:33:34.540]  Tarzan's Boy.
[02:33:34.560 --> 02:33:37.981]  I want to say hi to my daughter who's listening.
[02:33:38.001 --> 02:33:40.722]  I want to say a shout out to my oldest daughter.
[02:33:40.922 --> 02:33:46.924]  She's with my wife listening, and they just called up excited because I played that as bumper music, and that's one of her favorite songs.
[02:33:49.024 --> 02:33:49.805]  I love you, sweetheart.
[02:33:49.865 --> 02:33:50.305]  Be good.
[02:33:51.696 --> 02:34:03.400]  Okay, here's a quick announcement, and then I'm going back to your phone calls, and then I'm going to hit some other important news before this hour in broadcast ends.
[02:34:03.420 --> 02:34:07.362]  And that news is, we're launching an internet newsletter.
[02:34:07.382 --> 02:34:10.003]  And you're like, oh great, another internet newsletter.
[02:34:10.603 --> 02:34:12.204]  Well, this one's going to be a little different.
[02:34:12.984 --> 02:34:30.138]  And the reason we're launching this Friday, and you can sign up for free at InfoWars.com for it, is because we've analyzed the internet kill switch, the UN treaties being agreed to, the secret copyright treaty that was leaked a month ago, or now two months ago.
[02:34:32.023 --> 02:34:35.244]  And the whole web is going to cloud computing.
[02:34:36.305 --> 02:34:41.247]  It's going to force you to have your data somewhere else, and then you just have a device that ties into it.
[02:34:41.867 --> 02:34:45.368]  In three or four years, you won't even be able to buy a computer, a laptop, a device.
[02:34:45.668 --> 02:34:48.910]  All they're going to be is screens, and it's going to be roll-out plastic.
[02:34:49.650 --> 02:34:51.071]  They've had this for over a decade.
[02:34:51.091 --> 02:34:52.331]  It's just a screen.
[02:34:52.351 --> 02:34:56.253]  They're going to have newspapers that are digital, that are just...
[02:34:57.273 --> 02:35:00.335]  A piece of clear plastic that you move around has a tiny battery on it.
[02:35:00.755 --> 02:35:14.825]  They also have systems where the back of it is solar-powered, so you lay your newspaper down, it gets empowered by the sun in just a few seconds, you turn it over, or if you're in the sun it can shoot through the front and then empower it, but side issue.
[02:35:15.385 --> 02:35:17.507]  And again, that's how my brain works, I start going down rabbit trails.
[02:35:19.028 --> 02:35:22.590]  I'm just trying to briefly here describe to you while we're launching this newsletter,
[02:35:26.226 --> 02:35:38.052]  The Internet is being carved up under the Internet 2 corporate agreements for global private corporate governance, not just over our nations, our industries, our resources, but also over the Internet and cyberspace.
[02:35:39.112 --> 02:35:46.096]  And so, Microsoft, Google, Apple, Yahoo, all these big groups,
[02:35:47.426 --> 02:36:08.935]  are openly carving up the web and the new architecture of it through cyber security that enforces it, where basically more and more websites like grudgereport.com, infowars.com, and Google said this again last month, won't really be accessible on most networks because the web is so big they basically
[02:36:11.772 --> 02:36:30.467]  just phase in new quote private networks where when you agree to be on YouTube you agree to be on Google you agree to have a sub website on their platform and it's more complex than just what I'm saying and I've done special videos on it and broken it down but
[02:36:31.516 --> 02:36:33.056]  The point is we're in so much trouble.
[02:36:33.937 --> 02:36:36.177]  There's a move to start shutting down the web as we know it.
[02:36:36.257 --> 02:36:40.959]  And so going low-tech with email is something that will circumvent to a point.
[02:36:41.359 --> 02:36:49.482]  It's one more weapon on our arsenal to deliver content that is not on the internet, but is physically delivered to you.
[02:36:50.162 --> 02:36:56.304]  And so there's going to be exclusive articles every week, exclusive videos that are sent directly to you.
[02:36:57.384 --> 02:37:00.106]  And it links to things on the web as well.
[02:37:00.146 --> 02:37:01.647]  And it's the InfoWars Insider.
[02:37:02.207 --> 02:37:05.409]  And it's InfoWars information directly to you.
[02:37:05.429 --> 02:37:13.355]  And it's just one more thing we're launching along with the new studio and the TV show we're developing and all the other things that we've expanded over the years.
[02:37:13.395 --> 02:37:15.896]  It's one more tool in that fight.
[02:37:16.377 --> 02:37:20.820]  And if you go to InfoWars.com at the top of the
[02:37:23.436 --> 02:37:32.410]  Right-hand corner there is a yellow banner that says the InfoWars Insider Special Reports, Hottest News, Insider Scoop.
[02:37:32.431 --> 02:37:37.158]  And then when you put your email in there, it takes you to a welcome page that tells you what you're going to be getting.
[02:37:38.075 --> 02:37:49.343]  And it's just a way where even if they block Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or if they block it off certain networks, it's already starting to happen, we can still pound out an email directly to you.
[02:37:49.783 --> 02:37:55.607]  Now more and more Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are being added onto the spam filter software.
[02:37:57.216 --> 02:37:57.356]  That's
[02:38:17.072 --> 02:38:18.914]  Stream very powerful media outlet.
[02:38:19.195 --> 02:38:34.391]  We are becoming the mainstream the system is scared of straight talk scared of common sense and More and more we've been delisted from Google They're coming after us, but we're still growing despite that and so the system is
[02:38:35.012 --> 02:38:35.873]  Trying to curtail us.
[02:38:35.913 --> 02:38:38.735]  And I should be glad they're just trying to assassinate my character in the media.
[02:38:39.095 --> 02:38:45.459]  I should be glad that they're just trying to block me in cyberspace instead of just setting me up and putting me in prison or killing me.
[02:38:45.820 --> 02:38:50.143]  But they don't want to make me a martyr, so they're trying to stave the bleeding.
[02:38:50.163 --> 02:38:54.706]  They're trying to tie a tourniquet around their ankle, because we've chewed their leg off here.
[02:38:55.226 --> 02:38:56.007]  And it's not going to work.
[02:38:56.920 --> 02:38:58.781]  Because we'll just run over and start chewing on the other ankle.
[02:38:59.141 --> 02:39:01.022]  And then we'll climb up and chew on their throat.
[02:39:01.503 --> 02:39:02.283]  Like a pit bull.
[02:39:02.623 --> 02:39:04.184]  We're not letting go, we're not stopping.
[02:39:04.284 --> 02:39:05.225]  Genie's out of the bottle.
[02:39:06.045 --> 02:39:07.206]  Horse already left the barn.
[02:39:07.246 --> 02:39:08.286]  Train left the station.
[02:39:08.687 --> 02:39:09.927]  That ship already sailed.
[02:39:11.348 --> 02:39:12.769]  People know what's going on.
[02:39:13.129 --> 02:39:14.850]  And that's the most exciting thing I can tell you.
[02:39:14.890 --> 02:39:21.654]  It's not just my radio show and the numbers off the charts on terrestrial, internet, shortwave, satellite, all of that.
[02:39:22.414 --> 02:39:24.816]  It is the fact that I listen to talk radio.
[02:39:25.905 --> 02:39:33.491]  And the callers on Liberal, Conservative, Libertarian are calling in going, wait, it's not either I'm a Republican or I'm a Democrat.
[02:39:34.011 --> 02:39:39.255]  Mainline Republicans say all corporations are good, pure as a driven snow, all government's bad.
[02:39:39.735 --> 02:39:42.297]  Or Democrats are all government's good, all corporations are bad.
[02:39:42.618 --> 02:39:48.082]  People are figuring out it's mega corporations that aren't free market teaming up with government to rob us.
[02:39:48.502 --> 02:39:54.807]  That simple great truth is now out there and people are getting it and that's the beginning of the end.
[02:39:55.447 --> 02:40:10.650]  Once people look past the pitch men, the PR men like Obama and Rick Perry, once they look to the offshore banking cartel who gets the bailout money, the trillions, who lobbies to raise our gas prices as GM is doing today, they're a brokerage firm.
[02:40:11.271 --> 02:40:17.372]  Once people figure that out, that it's mega corporations using government to ban their competition, game over.
[02:40:18.430 --> 02:40:21.232]  So again, the free InfoWars Insider, sign up for it.
[02:40:21.552 --> 02:40:31.220]  There'll be an exclusive video sent out on Friday in the email, an exclusive article by Kurt Nemo, exclusive photos we've arranged to get from reporters that are going to be in Switzerland at Bilderberg, and more.
[02:40:31.600 --> 02:40:32.641]  InfoWars Insider.
[02:40:32.681 --> 02:40:33.762]  Okay, I'm done ranting about it.
[02:40:36.104 --> 02:40:39.526]  Let's go ahead and go back to your phone calls here.
[02:40:39.586 --> 02:40:40.347]  Jeff in Kentucky.
[02:40:40.387 --> 02:40:41.147]  Now I've got to move quick.
[02:40:41.187 --> 02:40:41.688]  Jeff, go ahead.
[02:40:42.526 --> 02:40:47.508]  Hey sir, I'd like to tell you a side out there was rain on us over the Memorial Day weekend in Bowling Green.
[02:40:47.808 --> 02:41:02.574]  Evidently, the FBI in conjunction with local law enforcement over a 20-month period radicalized two local Iraqi nationals into basically trying to ship weapons back to Iraq.
[02:41:02.694 --> 02:41:06.396]  And from what the local news says, the Iraqi nationals
[02:41:07.148 --> 02:41:16.584]  Posted in 2009 on a blog that they were upset that America was still occupying Iraq and this basically entailed the FBI
[02:41:18.314 --> 02:41:23.638]  Embedding a informant, not an informant, but an undercover agent posing as an Al-Qaeda member.
[02:41:24.019 --> 02:41:25.059]  Gotta be their leader.
[02:41:25.500 --> 02:41:26.240]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:41:26.260 --> 02:41:26.961]  See, that's the difference.
[02:41:26.981 --> 02:41:28.222]  This isn't just entrapment.
[02:41:28.642 --> 02:41:29.983]  This is fomentation.
[02:41:30.043 --> 02:41:31.164]  This is provocateuring.
[02:41:32.365 --> 02:41:38.930]  Even the New York Times, even the Associated Press, last year, they had a rash of these all over the country.
[02:41:39.311 --> 02:41:41.513]  And the media said, why do you get people with
[02:41:42.509 --> 02:41:43.150]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:41:57.904 --> 02:41:59.024]  Close to mentally retarded.
[02:41:59.044 --> 02:42:00.565]  ADIQ or so.
[02:42:00.845 --> 02:42:01.545]  They profile him.
[02:42:02.045 --> 02:42:03.225]  They profile him in prison.
[02:42:03.245 --> 02:42:03.786]  They get out.
[02:42:04.186 --> 02:42:15.389]  And a guy, you know, named Habib, a rock med, a con, or whatever, shows up and sometimes takes years, gives them money, takes care of them, get them to shoot their mouths off about...
[02:42:16.323 --> 02:42:16.623]  I don't know.
[02:42:37.759 --> 02:42:39.240]  They need to have these dummy groups.
[02:42:39.840 --> 02:42:43.282]  And so, they'll get a drugged out Muttalib, get him on the plane, on record.
[02:42:43.782 --> 02:42:43.982]  U.S.
[02:42:44.002 --> 02:42:45.663]  government got him on the plane, State Department admits it.
[02:42:46.423 --> 02:42:51.805]  They'll get a crazy psychiatrist, and statistically they're crazier than anybody else, statistically.
[02:42:52.206 --> 02:42:54.987]  And then he's protected and run by a Lockheed who works for the Pentagon.
[02:42:55.507 --> 02:42:59.471]  And yeah, they constantly have these, I did see that case, and it's always the same story.
[02:42:59.811 --> 02:43:03.714]  It's not FBI infiltrating a group that's planning something, you know, that gets into their meeting.
[02:43:04.074 --> 02:43:10.780]  They go out, have the leader open mosque up in some cases, and sit there and preach for years about killing.
[02:43:11.040 --> 02:43:16.005]  They tried that with militias for a decade, with Hal Turner, who attacked me every week.
[02:43:16.545 --> 02:43:18.787]  And I said, that guy's an FBI agent if there ever was one.
[02:43:19.147 --> 02:43:23.311]  Nobody's allowed to get up and say, get this federal judge, get this state judge.
[02:43:23.751 --> 02:43:27.834]  And finally, and all the emails have been released, well, first he got hacked.
[02:43:28.255 --> 02:43:32.939]  It was when he got hacked and the emails got released, by good patriots, that then the feds burned him.
[02:43:34.059 --> 02:43:41.885]  And it came out in federal court, national security asset above FBI, but controlled through the FBI, and they tried.
[02:43:41.945 --> 02:43:49.851]  I mean, folks, I have tried to build a veteran a house when they bulldoze his house, and they had cops coming on saying, let's attack the police.
[02:43:50.591 --> 02:43:56.516]  I can't have a video signing at a movie theater without cops coming in and saying, let's go after the police.
[02:43:57.558 --> 02:44:20.109]  I can't go to a Bilderberg group meeting and be at my own hotel eating a hamburger in the bar without big giant cops coming, obviously cops with shaved heads, you know, 50 years old, I mean, look tough as nails, and I'm not even saying they're cops, it turned out they were State Department diplomatic CIA security, and say, Alex, let's attack the State Department tomorrow.
[02:44:20.589 --> 02:44:23.070]  And I'm just like, come on man, you're a cop, take a photo of him.
[02:44:23.490 --> 02:44:26.451]  And it's like, come on, you guys know, you've profiled, we're non-violent.
[02:44:26.911 --> 02:44:31.252]  You just hope that I'd joke around with you so you could have on the news I'm a terrorist.
[02:44:33.613 --> 02:44:35.914]  This country's gone, folks, it's so gone.
[02:44:35.934 --> 02:44:38.014]  I don't know how we're going to get it back.
[02:44:38.455 --> 02:44:45.977]  I mean, does anybody believe that a fat Jewish kid from Southern California is in the top four commanders of Al-Qaeda?
[02:44:46.037 --> 02:44:49.218]  Maybe number one, Adam Gadon, who now is putting out a spiel of
[02:44:49.878 --> 02:44:53.040]  Anti-gun, you know, buy guns at gun shows and kill people.
[02:44:53.620 --> 02:44:54.981]  I mean, this is totally staged.
[02:44:55.061 --> 02:44:57.042]  I mean, I mean, is there no end?
[02:44:57.322 --> 02:44:58.222]  Are we so stupid?
[02:44:58.262 --> 02:45:04.665]  Is it so fun to buy into the fake fable of Al-Cieda that we've got to let the globalists destroy our society?
[02:45:05.246 --> 02:45:07.447]  All you good old boys have got to grow up or it's over.
[02:45:07.487 --> 02:45:09.668]  You better check the facts and realize this.
[02:45:10.008 --> 02:45:10.729]  Jeff, anything else?
[02:45:11.749 --> 02:45:17.232]  Yeah, the thing of it is that they said they got picked up in 03 by US forces for IED manufacturing.
[02:45:17.712 --> 02:45:18.973]  Thing of it is, I was in Iraq in 04.
[02:45:20.389 --> 02:45:24.214]  And we didn't do any forensics on IEDs because they're too unstable.
[02:45:24.254 --> 02:45:25.255]  They blow up in your face.
[02:45:25.415 --> 02:45:30.600]  So how did they pick these guys up and then all of a sudden they end up in Bowling Green, Kentucky of all places in 2009.
[02:45:30.801 --> 02:45:31.822]  Well that's another thing.
[02:45:31.862 --> 02:45:34.605]  See, you reminded me of the details.
[02:45:35.326 --> 02:45:36.327]  And you can look this up.
[02:45:38.015 --> 02:45:38.356]  I don't know.
[02:45:54.036 --> 02:45:54.416]  I don't
[02:46:10.647 --> 02:46:15.890]  5,000 plus Iraqis were brought in by George Herbert Walker Bush and then Bill Clinton.
[02:46:15.951 --> 02:46:17.431]  Bush brought in 3,000, Clinton over 2,000.
[02:46:17.892 --> 02:46:21.254]  And they were involved in and around Oklahoma City.
[02:46:21.594 --> 02:46:23.915]  And that came out in local Oklahoma news.
[02:46:24.236 --> 02:46:34.122]  There are 5,000 of these Iraqis that I've said hundreds of times will be used in the shopping mall attacks in the future for the mass roundup.
[02:46:35.851 --> 02:46:46.854]  Well Bowling Green is one of the big areas that during the Serbian war that they brought over refugees from Serbia, a lot of them Albanians, and then also in Iraq they brought over a lot of refugees from Iraq.
[02:46:46.995 --> 02:46:53.637]  And now we've got a large Muslim population who, by the way, are a large number of pillars of the community, doctors, lawyers, stuff like that.
[02:46:54.117 --> 02:46:57.778]  And these guys got picked up by the FBI and I think it was
[02:46:58.445 --> 02:46:59.065]  Absolutely, sir.
[02:46:59.085 --> 02:47:00.285]  I concur with your analysis.
[02:47:00.325 --> 02:47:00.966]  Thank you so much, Jeff.
[02:47:00.986 --> 02:47:02.266]  I gotta get to Josh, Jack, Scanner, Ryan.
[02:47:02.286 --> 02:47:05.747]  I gotta hit a little bit on this E. coli thing, but remember last week?
[02:47:21.693 --> 02:47:29.635]  Uh, the police reportedly shot a guy a whole bunch of times in his car in Miami, and then they put guns in people's faces, reportedly beat him up.
[02:47:30.295 --> 02:47:34.036]  Uh, folks that videotaped it, but they were able to hide the SIM card in their mouth.
[02:47:34.697 --> 02:47:36.517]  Other people shot it from on top the roof.
[02:47:37.577 --> 02:47:43.539]  And it reminds me of that when they shot that guy in the back who was in handcuffs, and then said he was resisting and not in handcuffs.
[02:47:45.077 --> 02:48:03.858]  uh... in uh... the bay area and then said that there were no cameras but it turned out they confiscated the cameras but somebody shot it and hid their camera and it's just really scary to see statistically how police will get caught lying but because of internet technology this big brother stuff cuts both ways
[02:48:04.959 --> 02:48:09.900]  And they're not going to be able to get away with this.
[02:48:09.940 --> 02:48:12.521]  So I would suggest police clean up their act.
[02:48:12.561 --> 02:48:22.664]  The corrupt politicians that run this country want to give you a long leash and encourage you to dishonor your uniform.
[02:48:23.715 --> 02:48:26.738]  But it's not going to happen.
[02:48:27.298 --> 02:48:31.262]  Here are police aiming guns at people down the street.
[02:48:32.763 --> 02:48:33.584]  We're playing the video.
[02:48:33.604 --> 02:48:34.405]  We can't play the audio.
[02:48:34.425 --> 02:48:35.265]  There's too much cussing.
[02:48:35.285 --> 02:48:39.709]  We'll edit this and bleep it out tomorrow and then play it on air.
[02:48:40.230 --> 02:48:45.474]  But we'll get that video that just finally got released up on Infowars.com right now.
[02:48:46.698 --> 02:48:51.379]  Also, with the free email system, you can sign up at thetopofinfowars.com for free.
[02:48:51.679 --> 02:49:04.121]  We'll also have News Blast, Key Intel, I'll get set up on it, and kind of like our own private tweet system that isn't on their platform, I'll send out Key Intel Blast to you, photographs and more.
[02:49:04.141 --> 02:49:05.621]  I just wanted to add that.
[02:49:05.721 --> 02:49:07.182]  Josh in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:49:08.802 --> 02:49:10.822]  Alex, I just wanted to thank you for all that you do.
[02:49:10.862 --> 02:49:15.203]  I've been waiting to talk to you for a while, and I know you're a busy guy, but I just wanted to thank you for all that you do.
[02:49:15.922 --> 02:49:19.966]  My question is, I want to help get Ron Paul elected.
[02:49:19.986 --> 02:49:22.848]  I think he's the last choice, you know, last hope that we've got.
[02:49:22.928 --> 02:49:30.715]  But I also want to know, you know, biggest thing is how do we organize locally and get people to understand, you know, see your videos, understand really what's going on?
[02:49:31.923 --> 02:49:35.905]  Well look, Ron Paul is a great hope, but he is not the only hope.
[02:49:36.425 --> 02:49:44.669]  We got states' rights, we individually are waking people up, folks are really starting to figure out who the players are here on the good team and the bad team.
[02:49:45.129 --> 02:49:55.274]  Ron Paul, whether he wins, loses, or draws, wins because he'll be able to inject real issues during this campaign season that will dwarf what he was able to do three years ago.
[02:49:56.254 --> 02:50:01.197]  And so we need to point out that Rick Perry, Mitt Romney wrote the health care law.
[02:50:02.344 --> 02:50:03.485]  That Obama copied.
[02:50:04.085 --> 02:50:07.288]  This is who we want as the Republican frontrunner.
[02:50:07.668 --> 02:50:08.589]  Ron Paul's number two.
[02:50:09.029 --> 02:50:10.930]  A guy who's as phony as a $3 bill.
[02:50:10.950 --> 02:50:13.372]  I mean, so that's what I say.
[02:50:13.932 --> 02:50:17.975]  Perry, I told you two years ago, is going to run for president.
[02:50:18.436 --> 02:50:22.519]  I mean, that's the inside baseball from Texas Republicans we've got.
[02:50:22.539 --> 02:50:25.441]  And Perry is a Bilderberg Group attendee.
[02:50:25.901 --> 02:50:30.945]  I know he wears cowboy hats and struts around in cowboy boots, but again, he's as fake as
[02:50:32.401 --> 02:50:32.881]  They come.
[02:50:33.822 --> 02:50:34.442]  He's a phony.
[02:50:35.042 --> 02:50:40.184]  And so people better not vote for what they see as the cool politician, who they think the winner is.
[02:50:40.624 --> 02:50:44.626]  They better vote for Ron Paul in these primaries.
[02:50:45.586 --> 02:50:55.550]  And then, if Ron Paul loses, and some Republican wins, and they become president, you're just gonna see the establishment get a few more years of conning people, like with Obama.
[02:51:00.444 --> 02:51:03.486]  Will I have garlic breath after I take Ali-C?
[02:51:03.806 --> 02:51:07.829]  We get that question all the time about the world's best garlic extract, Ali-C.
[02:51:08.150 --> 02:51:16.696]  And the answer is, Ali-C contains stabilized allicin, nature's antimicrobial agent, and the active ingredient in crushed garlic, but will not give you garlic breath.
[02:51:16.996 --> 02:51:23.981]  Scientifically proven in double-blind studies, using low doses of allicin greatly reduces the number, severity, and duration of common colds.
[02:51:24.261 --> 02:51:28.126]  Our powerful Ali-C contains 300 milligrams of stabilized allicin.
[02:51:28.406 --> 02:51:32.231]  Just one tablet of Ali-C is equivalent to 40 garlic cloves.
[02:51:32.511 --> 02:51:39.279]  It's effective against asthma, MRSA, bacterial fungal and viral infections, and helps lower high blood pressure and high cholesterol.
[02:51:39.399 --> 02:51:41.341]  Plus, it's a natural mosquito repellent.
[02:51:41.481 --> 02:51:44.405]  Boosts resistance to infection with nature's best garlic extract.
[02:51:44.745 --> 02:51:49.872]  Ali C. For more information and to order Ali C., call 877-888-7126 or go to GarlicHealthProducts.com.
[02:51:49.892 --> 02:51:51.954]  That's 877-888-7126 or GarlicHealthProducts.com.
[02:51:51.974 --> 02:51:52.775]  Fight back with Ali C.
[02:51:59.784 --> 02:52:01.046]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:52:01.086 --> 02:52:06.453]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:52:06.694 --> 02:52:11.320]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:52:11.721 --> 02:52:12.101]  It's true.
[02:52:12.181 --> 02:52:16.748]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:52:17.268 --> 02:52:21.972]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:52:22.492 --> 02:52:29.418]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:52:29.618 --> 02:52:30.519]  And here's the best part.
[02:52:30.739 --> 02:52:37.084]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:52:37.404 --> 02:52:40.246]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:52:40.586 --> 02:52:42.487]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[02:52:42.828 --> 02:52:43.668]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:52:43.688 --> 02:52:43.908]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:52:43.948 --> 02:52:46.890]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:52:47.390 --> 02:52:49.132]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:52:59.522 --> 02:53:03.905]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about a product the drug companies don't want you to know about.
[02:53:04.065 --> 02:53:05.466]  It's called Osteo-K.
[02:53:05.806 --> 02:53:12.971]  Osteo-K is an osteoporosis supplement shown to decrease fractures 87% without any of the dangerous side effects of medications.
[02:53:13.271 --> 02:53:15.793]  Calcium and vitamin D only decrease fractures by 16%.
[02:53:16.833 --> 02:53:19.115]  Osteo-K decreases fractures an astounding 87%.
[02:53:19.155 --> 02:53:22.677]  Friends, osteoporosis is a deadly disease.
[02:53:22.897 --> 02:53:27.280]  Research shows the most effective approach for protecting your bones is not a drug at all.
[02:53:27.440 --> 02:53:28.141]  It's Osteo-K.
[02:53:28.641 --> 02:53:35.125]  Manufactured entirely in America, Osteo-K is available without a prescription and comes with an unconditional money-back guarantee.
[02:53:35.386 --> 02:53:41.590]  Don't wait until it's too late, because if you have osteoporosis and fracture a hip, you have a 20% chance of dying within a year.
[02:53:41.870 --> 02:53:43.911]  I urge you to take charge of your health today.
[02:53:44.151 --> 02:53:46.133]  I cannot recommend this breakthrough product enough.
[02:53:46.353 --> 02:53:49.135]  Go to www.nbihealth.com or call 800-624-1416 right now.
[02:53:49.595 --> 02:53:50.015]  That's 800-624-1416.
[02:53:50.035 --> 02:53:50.916]  Start taking Osteo-K.
[02:54:00.543 --> 02:54:04.186]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now!
[02:54:05.888 --> 02:54:11.473]  Okay, I said I was gonna get in to the, uh, coli death here in the United States.
[02:54:12.995 --> 02:54:15.197]  But I'm not, I have to get to that tomorrow.
[02:54:16.667 --> 02:54:18.128]  I want to spend a lot of time on this.
[02:54:18.628 --> 02:54:21.929]  Drive in Virginia, girl dead from E. coli, brother in stable condition.
[02:54:22.650 --> 02:54:28.292]  They're saying it may be the deadly mutated genetically engineered, and that's admitted that it's been messed with.
[02:54:29.193 --> 02:54:30.833]  And the British are saying it's Al Qaeda.
[02:54:30.853 --> 02:54:31.834]  Give me a break, folks.
[02:54:31.994 --> 02:54:40.417]  Only the top bioweapons labs that Big Agra happens to have similar systems to, or Big Pharma could do this.
[02:54:41.058 --> 02:54:44.159]  Just like we told you back in 2001, the anthrax attack was government.
[02:54:44.539 --> 02:54:45.940]  Came out later, it was government.
[02:54:47.250 --> 02:54:50.112]  They just blamed some government patsy who then died in custody.
[02:54:50.752 --> 02:54:52.734]  The first three patsies, it turned out, were innocent.
[02:54:54.075 --> 02:55:01.620]  But they're using this to try to crack down on local organic farms and things, and they keep blaming this organic food, that organic food, and then moving on.
[02:55:01.660 --> 02:55:05.002]  It's sprouts, it's cucumbers, it's tomatoes.
[02:55:05.062 --> 02:55:06.143]  No, it's this, it's that.
[02:55:06.723 --> 02:55:08.965]  This was spiked, and I've got the evidence.
[02:55:10.296 --> 02:55:13.698]  The World Health Organization says time running out to solve E. coli outbreak.
[02:55:13.738 --> 02:55:14.599]  It's been spiked.
[02:55:15.339 --> 02:55:16.760]  That's why they can't find the source.
[02:55:17.781 --> 02:55:21.944]  And meanwhile it's reported Whole Foods admits it's organic foods contain genetically modified ingredients.
[02:55:22.684 --> 02:55:26.787]  Folks, in every major study, and I'm going to do a special video on this.
[02:55:26.907 --> 02:55:28.709]  I mentioned it earlier in the last week.
[02:55:29.709 --> 02:55:30.590]  In every major study,
[02:55:32.398 --> 02:55:33.199]  I mean, here's one right here.
[02:55:33.339 --> 02:55:33.439]  U.S.
[02:55:33.459 --> 02:55:42.165]  Department of Agriculture funding corn and rice studies that have an autoimmune trigger that sterilizes women.
[02:55:42.845 --> 02:55:44.666]  They have another rice that sterilizes men.
[02:55:44.686 --> 02:55:48.849]  And then I look at the long-term studies on stuff that's been deployed in the last decade.
[02:55:49.570 --> 02:55:52.972]  It's reducing fertility in the crops that are already approved and we're eating.
[02:55:53.392 --> 02:55:54.973]  You wonder why fertility's dropping.
[02:55:55.034 --> 02:55:55.534]  It's dropping.
[02:55:55.774 --> 02:55:57.335]  You wonder why cancer's off the chart.
[02:55:57.435 --> 02:55:59.437]  I wanted to talk about Katherine Albrecht.
[02:56:00.345 --> 02:56:01.825]  In fact, Jaren, we've got to get her on.
[02:56:01.986 --> 02:56:04.026]  I've meant to, but I didn't want to bother her.
[02:56:04.106 --> 02:56:11.548]  She asked me to fill in for her a few months ago when she had surgery and then has been on chemo, and I just, I can't do two hours after my show every day.
[02:56:11.568 --> 02:56:12.529]  It would be too exhausting.
[02:56:13.229 --> 02:56:17.850]  But I think to honor her before she quits doing her show weekdays, I probably need to do it.
[02:56:18.310 --> 02:56:19.391]  But we need to have her on.
[02:56:19.571 --> 02:56:23.112]  She is going into stage four breast cancer.
[02:56:23.792 --> 02:56:26.198]  And they say that she's probably going to die.
[02:56:26.579 --> 02:56:30.208]  Great lady fighting the RFID spy chip situation.
[02:56:31.633 --> 02:56:33.174]  And they say the good die young.
[02:56:34.695 --> 02:56:39.217]  Very, very young, beautiful woman, a mother, a good person.
[02:56:40.517 --> 02:56:46.200]  And she helped, of course, launch the start page, Alternative to Google.
[02:56:46.461 --> 02:56:48.522]  And we need to get her on.
[02:56:48.562 --> 02:56:49.682]  She's quitting her radio show.
[02:56:49.722 --> 02:56:53.404]  I'm going to try to do weekends, and we need everybody to pray for Katherine Albrecht.
[02:56:55.565 --> 02:56:56.606]  It's very, very sad.
[02:56:58.729 --> 02:57:27.370]  This morning I went for a jog after I hung out with my children and did some research and I ran up this hill and was real tired because I'm a fat slob and I laid on my back and looked up through the uh... looked up to the sweet gum leaves into the sunny sky and I just thought about how special and short life is and how good life is and how loving people are and how innocent my children are and how innocent your children are and the fact that goodness
[02:57:28.407 --> 02:57:35.571]  The goodness on this planet deserves to be defended and all of us need to step forward and be champions for liberty.
[02:57:36.551 --> 02:57:38.632]  Need to be champions for the truth.
[02:57:38.712 --> 02:57:42.274]  And it doesn't mean all of us have the answers or that we'll get the job done 100%.
[02:57:42.834 --> 02:57:45.476]  We've just got to step forward to the plate
[02:57:46.960 --> 02:57:48.241]  And God will do the rest.
[02:57:48.541 --> 02:57:53.705]  You know, I was looking through comments during the break on this article that's up at Infowars.com.
[02:57:53.745 --> 02:57:56.988]  Major Swiss newspaper gives Bilderberg front page coverage.
[02:57:57.348 --> 02:57:59.630]  We're going to have some surprises this week in Bilderberg coverage.
[02:57:59.650 --> 02:58:00.530]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[02:58:00.851 --> 02:58:03.953]  You'll want to join us in the next three days at 11 a.m.
[02:58:03.993 --> 02:58:06.715]  Central, 12 noon Eastern, 9 a.m.
[02:58:06.975 --> 02:58:09.037]  Pacific, 10 a.m.
[02:58:09.077 --> 02:58:09.357]  Mountain.
[02:58:11.007 --> 02:58:14.129]  I was reading this comment, and there's a whole bunch of these, and it's gotta be COINTELPRO.
[02:58:14.169 --> 02:58:20.774]  It says, but where was the intrepid Alex Jones when we patriots in New Hampshire were protesting George Soros and Bretton Woods too?
[02:58:20.794 --> 02:58:23.176]  We're getting arrested, having our signs ripped up.
[02:58:23.456 --> 02:58:24.576]  You people barely covered this.
[02:58:24.997 --> 02:58:25.937]  We even got inside.
[02:58:25.957 --> 02:58:29.740]  So I saw that, and I went and looked it up, and it turned out we did post videos of it.
[02:58:29.940 --> 02:58:30.621]  I didn't know!
[02:58:30.961 --> 02:58:31.501]  That's why.
[02:58:31.641 --> 02:58:32.882]  I'm not intrepid.
[02:58:33.142 --> 02:58:34.143]  I don't know everything.
[02:58:34.383 --> 02:58:38.006]  Good job for stepping up, but I'm not bad because I didn't know about what you did.
[02:58:38.026 --> 02:58:39.067]  God bless you all.
[02:58:41.428 --> 02:58:42.669]  Y'all gotta step up, folks!
[02:58:42.729 --> 02:58:43.629]  I'm not your daddy!
[02:58:44.090 --> 02:58:45.510]  I'm not your mommy!
[02:58:46.271 --> 02:58:47.311]  It's all of us together!
[02:58:47.331 --> 02:58:47.972]  Just a man!
[02:58:47.992 --> 02:58:53.635]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[02:58:54.475 --> 02:58:55.376]  Tyranny is here.
[02:58:55.736 --> 02:58:59.298]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:58:59.438 --> 02:59:01.860]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:59:01.880 --> 02:59:07.343]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:59:07.763 --> 02:59:09.664]  This film conclusively proves the existence
