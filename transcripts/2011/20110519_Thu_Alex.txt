[00:00:04.861 --> 00:00:09.707]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.707 --> 00:00:11.289]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:12.831]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.831 --> 00:00:17.037]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.037 --> 00:00:21.082]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.711 --> 00:00:27.652]  We're live, my friends.
[00:00:27.652 --> 00:00:31.094]  It is Thursday, the 19th day of May, 2011.
[00:00:31.094 --> 00:00:37.377]  We're going to be live here for at least the next three hours.
[00:00:37.377 --> 00:00:50.884]  We have Dr. Paul Craig Roberts joining us on The Economy and also his contention that this is a police state setup with Dominique Strauss-Kahn because Kahn hadn't been going along with the absolute total raping
[00:00:51.804 --> 00:00:52.204]  I don't know.
[00:01:10.835 --> 00:01:25.759]  I have no doubt where there's smoke, there's fire, but I want to hear what Dr. Paul Craig Roberts has to say about all this today, coming up in an hour and a half from now, and another visit with Dr. Steve Pchenik today in the third hour.
[00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:37.382]  We may even go in a little bit of overdrive with him to take your phone calls if you've got any questions or comments for him, but I will bring up the continuity of agenda question for him that listeners have wanted me to pose.
[00:01:40.037 --> 00:01:44.801]  How can he say that George Herbert Walker Bush was good, but then George W. Bush is bad?
[00:01:44.801 --> 00:01:53.648]  How can he say 9-11's an inside job and the Bin Laden thing's fake, and then say that earlier administrations from his perspective were better?
[00:01:53.648 --> 00:01:54.829]  Well, that's his personal view.
[00:01:54.829 --> 00:02:00.834]  We've had him on about his inside intel as a psychological warfare expert.
[00:02:02.535 --> 00:02:25.218]  And the whole Bin Laden situation, but I will pose that question to him, but I've also got him on dealing with a Wall Street Journal article that dealt with Al Qaeda wanting a safe harbor inside the United States and a known Al Qaeda affiliate basically being mainlined by the US media.
[00:02:27.208 --> 00:02:32.010]  And what Pchenik calls payoffs to administration officials to get them to do that.
[00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.933]  So some very interesting information with Dr. Steve Pchenik coming up in the third hour today.
[00:02:38.933 --> 00:02:43.715]  That said, I ended up staying up here until around midnight last night.
[00:02:43.715 --> 00:02:48.357]  Aaron Dykes has not even left, even though I told him, I said, look,
[00:02:49.923 --> 00:02:51.023]  Go ahead and come back in.
[00:02:51.023 --> 00:02:52.504]  You know, don't stay too late.
[00:02:52.504 --> 00:02:56.024]  I guess midnight around here isn't that late these days.
[00:02:56.024 --> 00:02:57.385]  I said, don't stay up all night.
[00:02:57.385 --> 00:03:03.646]  Well, Aaron has such a passion for the information that he's here right now.
[00:03:03.646 --> 00:03:16.449]  The 10-minute expose video is ready, but because it's shot in high def, it has to convert several times before it can be uploaded to YouTube.
[00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:18.670]  And it may be ready.
[00:03:19.966 --> 00:03:21.608]  By the end of the show, probably not.
[00:03:21.608 --> 00:03:23.890]  I haven't even come up with a headline for it.
[00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.172]  I don't know what you call this.
[00:03:26.172 --> 00:03:33.399]  Just a White House running scared over birth certificate.
[00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:35.321]  Birth certificate hoax part two.
[00:03:35.321 --> 00:03:40.166]  I've got a big stack of news and information that broke last night.
[00:03:41.465 --> 00:03:47.829]  We've already found that, but Corsi is pretty conservative when it comes to being very careful to make bold statements.
[00:04:04.517 --> 00:04:09.038]  His book doesn't even say that Obama basically wasn't born in Hawaii.
[00:04:09.038 --> 00:04:13.440]  It just says there's a cover-up of it and give us the birth certificate.
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.881]  And of course, he's revealed that three weeks before the birth certificate was released, he had word it was going to be released.
[00:04:18.881 --> 00:04:27.684]  I also had word through reporters in and around the White House and out of Chicago that that was the case.
[00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:31.085]  And they thought about releasing it with Bill O'Reilly on the Super Bowl.
[00:04:32.438 --> 00:04:35.099]  But thought better of it to close it to the election.
[00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:36.439]  There's been some big developments.
[00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:40.121]  Esquire got caught putting out a hoax article yesterday.
[00:04:40.121 --> 00:04:42.661]  WorldNetDaily says they're looking at suing them.
[00:04:42.661 --> 00:04:45.282]  I think they pretty much have to.
[00:04:45.282 --> 00:04:50.984]  Because this was definitely economic warfare against WorldNetDaily.
[00:04:50.984 --> 00:04:53.325]  And it's a psychological warfare tactic.
[00:04:53.325 --> 00:04:55.226]  We'll tell you about that.
[00:04:55.226 --> 00:04:57.486]  There's a bunch of geopolitical news.
[00:04:57.486 --> 00:04:58.807]  Very scary police state news.
[00:04:58.807 --> 00:04:59.207]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.147 --> 00:05:01.328]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:05:01.328 --> 00:05:08.252]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:05:08.252 --> 00:05:10.813]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:05:10.813 --> 00:05:16.196]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:05:16.196 --> 00:05:19.238]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:05:19.238 --> 00:05:21.299]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:27.784]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:05:27.784 --> 00:05:31.166]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:05:31.166 --> 00:05:36.951]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:05:36.951 --> 00:05:38.592]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:05:38.592 --> 00:05:39.893]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:05:39.893 --> 00:05:42.575]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:05:42.575 --> 00:05:46.798]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:05:46.798 --> 00:05:48.820]  You can find the video at www.
[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.402]  End of America 3 dot com.
[00:05:51.402 --> 00:05:52.543]  That's End of America.
[00:05:52.543 --> 00:05:53.984]  The number 3 dot com.
[00:05:53.984 --> 00:05:57.868]  Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[00:05:57.868 --> 00:05:59.970]  That's endofamerica3.com.
[00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:02.953]  It could never happen in America, but it's happening right now.
[00:06:02.953 --> 00:06:06.276]  Gas prices are exploding past the incomes of millions of families.
[00:06:06.556 --> 00:06:13.180]  As gas prices and crop failures push high food costs, you can still get the best food on the planet from eFoodsDirect.com.

[00:07:04.066 --> 00:07:05.327]  Tyranny is here.
[00:07:05.327 --> 00:07:09.190]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:11.491]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:07:11.491 --> 00:07:17.355]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[00:07:17.355 --> 00:07:23.600]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:30.003]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:07:30.003 --> 00:07:34.165]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:07:34.165 --> 00:07:38.468]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:07:38.468 --> 00:07:44.411]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:07:44.411 --> 00:07:47.973]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:07:47.973 --> 00:07:49.934]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:07:49.934 --> 00:07:50.374]  It's here.

[00:08:00.717 --> 00:08:06.258]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:25.414 --> 00:08:27.715]  It is Thursday, the 19th day of May, 2011.
[00:08:27.715 --> 00:08:33.236]  Dr. Paul Greg Roberts joining us, also Dr. Steve Pchenik.
[00:08:33.236 --> 00:08:38.117]  There has been some huge new developments on the whole Obama birth certificate situation.
[00:08:38.117 --> 00:08:41.578]  I'm going to be breaking that down in a moment.
[00:08:41.578 --> 00:08:50.080]  Also, in other news, we're going to be going over Dominique Strauss-Kahn to resign as IMF post, may get a $1 million bail.
[00:08:52.401 --> 00:08:53.102]  In New York.
[00:09:09.875 --> 00:09:13.757]  Dominic Strauss-Kahn has arrived for a sex case bail hearing.
[00:09:13.757 --> 00:09:16.759]  We'll give you the latest on that as it unfolds.
[00:09:16.759 --> 00:09:26.665]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts does join us, coming up in about an hour and a half from now, dealing with his headline, The Strauss-Kahn Frame-Up, The American Police State Strides Forward.
[00:09:26.665 --> 00:09:28.246]  I have an open mind on this whole thing.
[00:09:28.246 --> 00:09:29.526]  I don't know what happened.
[00:09:29.526 --> 00:09:31.507]  I don't think any of us really do.
[00:09:31.507 --> 00:09:33.709]  That's why we have trials in this country.
[00:09:34.289 --> 00:09:41.852]  That's why everyone deserves a trial, even if it's an unsavory, pro-world government Bilderberg group member like Strauss-Kahn.
[00:09:41.852 --> 00:09:47.614]  Because if this dirtbag doesn't have access to a free and fair trial, I am not going to have one.
[00:09:47.614 --> 00:09:48.674]  You understand?
[00:09:48.674 --> 00:09:53.175]  That's why Ron Paul is right saying, okay, Bin Laden did it, you say.
[00:09:53.175 --> 00:09:54.696]  Arrest him.
[00:09:54.696 --> 00:09:56.216]  If he didn't resist, arrest him.
[00:09:56.216 --> 00:09:56.837]  Bring him in.
[00:09:56.837 --> 00:09:59.237]  Let's hear.
[00:09:59.237 --> 00:10:00.218]  Let's interrogate him.
[00:10:00.218 --> 00:10:01.578]  Let's get him on the witness stand.
[00:10:01.578 --> 00:10:02.559]  Let's call witnesses.
[00:10:02.559 --> 00:10:03.519]  Let's find out.
[00:10:04.119 --> 00:10:05.259]  That's what trials are about.
[00:10:05.259 --> 00:10:08.201]  They're investigations of the truth.
[00:10:08.201 --> 00:10:20.345]  And anybody that promotes not having trials, anybody that promotes torture, anybody that promotes secret arrest, anybody that promotes secret military commissions is a tyrant.
[00:10:21.613 --> 00:10:27.138]  And is a criminal pushing the absolute abolition of freedom.
[00:10:27.138 --> 00:10:29.680]  History is 100% clear on that.
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:34.464]  So we'll be getting a breakdown from Dr. Paul Craig Roberts on that coming up.
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:53.682]  Speaking of police state, on the heels of last week's Indiana Supreme Court ruling where the head judge in the decision, in the winning decision, it was a 3-2 at the Supreme Court, said, I read the quote repeatedly, that the police can go in your house for any reason or no reason at all.
[00:10:55.963 --> 00:10:56.103]  I think?
[00:11:11.818 --> 00:11:14.900]  The Constitution, Bill of Rights, Declaration of Independence.
[00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:16.621]  And people can say, well, it isn't perfect.
[00:11:16.621 --> 00:11:19.444]  It isn't perfect because we haven't enforced it.
[00:11:19.444 --> 00:11:24.507]  We've let criminals slowly abridge it until now the bottom has fallen out.
[00:11:24.507 --> 00:11:25.408]  Same week, U.S.
[00:11:25.408 --> 00:11:28.530]  Supreme Court abridged the Fourth Amendment about 90%.
[00:11:30.259 --> 00:11:40.711]  This gun case in Indiana is 100% and is over the top.
[00:11:40.711 --> 00:11:41.531]  If it's possible, it's 110%.
[00:11:41.531 --> 00:11:47.918]  And here's IllinoisGunReportingForInfoWars.com, Indiana Sheriff
[00:11:49.008 --> 00:11:53.494]  House-to-house random search is now possible for guns.
[00:11:53.494 --> 00:12:04.390]  And remember Blagojevich, a few months before he got disgraced, we played the CBS News clip, gave a press conference and said, I want to use the National Guard door-to-door searching for guns.
[00:12:05.071 --> 00:12:07.753]  Just, well, you have no presumption of innocence.
[00:12:07.753 --> 00:12:09.054]  We're going to come search your guns.
[00:12:09.054 --> 00:12:12.717]  And the feds have financed with grants, and so the cops take it and do it.
[00:12:12.717 --> 00:12:20.382]  Knock and talk for at least a decade, from Arizona to Texas, from Vermont to Massachusetts to California.
[00:12:20.382 --> 00:12:22.463]  Liberal, conservative states, they don't care.
[00:12:22.463 --> 00:12:23.925]  Particularly Texas does this.
[00:12:24.665 --> 00:12:31.271]  Houston and Dallas that I've seen in the Dallas Morning News, Houston Chronicle, they come to your door and say, we'd like to come in and look at your guns.
[00:12:31.271 --> 00:12:33.933]  And most people just are intimidated and say, come on in.
[00:12:33.933 --> 00:12:35.334]  I have nothing to hide.
[00:12:35.334 --> 00:12:38.096]  It's the state that has to be bound down and controlled.
[00:12:38.096 --> 00:12:43.300]  It's not that we have something to hide, and so that's why we're against letting them in.
[00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.022]  It's that they can't be trusted in history.
[00:12:47.090 --> 00:13:04.450]  They work for us 100% of the time when cops start coming into your house without warrants and there's more news out of the thousands and thousands of secret sneak and peek warrants issued by secret federal courts under the Patriot Act and it's non-terror related in almost every case.
[00:13:05.387 --> 00:13:06.008]  I don't know.
[00:13:25.069 --> 00:13:26.690]  A week and a half.
[00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:30.731]  The Arizona SWAT team shoots Latino former Marine dozens of times.
[00:13:30.731 --> 00:13:34.133]  This guy had no criminal record.
[00:13:34.133 --> 00:13:36.334]  This guy was upstanding record in the Marine Corps.
[00:13:36.334 --> 00:13:38.835]  Two turds, heavy combat in Iraq.
[00:13:38.835 --> 00:13:39.835]  His wife wakes him up.
[00:13:39.835 --> 00:13:41.636]  He's working the graveyard ship.
[00:13:41.636 --> 00:13:43.097]  Just been asleep two hours.
[00:13:43.097 --> 00:13:46.298]  Got home at seven, ate something, went to bed.
[00:13:46.298 --> 00:13:47.499]  Woke him up.
[00:13:47.499 --> 00:13:52.221]  My wife's woken me up before when she's seen somebody walking around by the back gate or
[00:13:53.602 --> 00:14:02.630]  One time somebody climbed the fence and got in our yard, some crazed fan, and my wife's woken me up before, because I sleep like a dead Pharaoh.
[00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:05.332]  I mean, I sleep like I've been dead for 2,000 years.
[00:14:05.332 --> 00:14:06.854]  You can have firecrackers going off.
[00:14:06.854 --> 00:14:11.298]  I mean, you can shake me, and it's actually a weakness that I sleep like the dead.
[00:14:11.298 --> 00:14:16.582]  But she's shaken me awake before, you know, to go to the instant access pistol safe and get a gun.
[00:14:18.484 --> 00:14:31.547]  The children saw men looking in, ran to their mother, she saw men looking in, she woke her husband up, he went for his AR-15, they busted down the door and reportedly shot him 60 times of 70 shots.
[00:14:31.547 --> 00:14:36.408]  I gotta hand it to them, usually when SWAT teams do this, they shoot 100 times and only hit the person 2 or 3 times.
[00:14:36.408 --> 00:14:42.310]  Of 70 shots hit him 60 times, basically liquefying him, but he was still alive.
[00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:47.614]  And what's really outraged folks are the transcripts of the tapes, the 9-1-1 tapes.
[00:14:47.614 --> 00:14:48.975]  She's calling saying, please help.
[00:14:48.975 --> 00:14:52.278]  And she goes, sorry, it's a SWAT team.
[00:14:52.278 --> 00:14:54.180]  I'm not sending you an ambulance, basically.
[00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:55.761]  She's like, he's bleeding to death.
[00:14:55.761 --> 00:14:56.762]  He needs help.
[00:14:56.762 --> 00:14:59.144]  And five minutes later, she goes, he stopped breathing.
[00:14:59.144 --> 00:14:59.684]  He's dead.
[00:14:59.684 --> 00:15:01.005]  I can't believe she's so calm.
[00:15:01.005 --> 00:15:04.328]  She says, listen, the woman's like, well, there's a SWAT team at that address.
[00:15:04.328 --> 00:15:05.689]  Those are law officers, correct?
[00:15:05.689 --> 00:15:07.451]  She's like, he's bleeding to death.
[00:15:07.451 --> 00:15:08.231]  Just give me help.
[00:15:08.231 --> 00:15:09.512]  Well, there's a SWAT team there.
[00:15:10.313 --> 00:15:13.395]  Didn't send the ambulance.
[00:15:13.395 --> 00:15:17.838]  Because you don't send an ambulance when gods have just killed somebody.
[00:15:17.838 --> 00:15:22.962]  And now, all over the country, they're announcing they're going to do no-knocks for everything.
[00:15:22.962 --> 00:15:27.705]  You've got unpaid parking tickets, and they're actually advertising this.
[00:15:27.705 --> 00:15:32.788]  Here in Austin, they have announcements, taxpayer-paid for ads that go, ROUND UP!
[00:15:33.749 --> 00:15:35.471]  I always mean to try to find one of those.
[00:15:35.471 --> 00:15:38.513]  I hear it on KLBJ and other stations.
[00:15:38.513 --> 00:15:39.254]  Roundup!
[00:15:39.254 --> 00:15:41.435]  This weekend, your last chance!
[00:15:41.435 --> 00:15:43.677]  Sounds like it's a monster truck advertiser.
[00:15:43.677 --> 00:15:47.160]  This week at the Coliseum, a monster truck extravaganza!
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.301]  Be there, be there!
[00:15:48.301 --> 00:15:49.362]  The Gravedigger!
[00:15:49.362 --> 00:15:50.783]  The Master!
[00:15:50.783 --> 00:15:52.184]  Dinosaur Crusher!
[00:15:52.184 --> 00:15:56.087]  Well, it sounds like the same guy that does the monster truck ads.
[00:15:56.087 --> 00:15:59.030]  This weekend, the Roundup begins!
[00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:01.592]  If you haven't paid your ticket,
[00:16:01.792 --> 00:16:02.972]  The warrant's coming!
[00:16:02.972 --> 00:16:04.633]  We're coming to your house!
[00:16:04.633 --> 00:16:05.673]  Pay it now!
[00:16:05.673 --> 00:16:09.074]  Call this city number or go online to pay!
[00:16:09.074 --> 00:16:10.674]  Openly trying to scare people.
[00:16:10.674 --> 00:16:14.235]  Now it's 11% of Texas has arrest warrants out.
[00:16:14.235 --> 00:16:15.536]  Oh, that's a free society.
[00:16:15.536 --> 00:16:16.396]  They can't pay.
[00:16:16.396 --> 00:16:17.096]  They're bankrupt.
[00:16:17.096 --> 00:16:20.637]  Cops everywhere writing tickets, squeezing everyone.
[00:16:20.637 --> 00:16:22.918]  Illegal aliens above the law racing around.
[00:16:22.918 --> 00:16:23.638]  But my point is...
[00:16:24.724 --> 00:16:25.685]  They call it Roundup.
[00:16:25.685 --> 00:16:27.465]  They have these ads all over the country.
[00:16:27.465 --> 00:16:30.907]  So people get used to hearing about real roundups of political dissidents.
[00:16:30.907 --> 00:16:32.388]  When it happens, it's an acclamation.
[00:16:32.388 --> 00:16:35.030]  That's an army psych warfare program.
[00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:47.716]  Before the Panama invasion, for months, they flew helicopters around, did touch and goes, would drop flashbangs, just so the Panamanian military, when the real attack happened, would hesitate just a minute or two while the C-130s blasted them.
[00:16:49.673 --> 00:16:54.297]  With their Vulcan guns, their Gatlin guns, and their howitzers.
[00:16:54.297 --> 00:16:57.480]  And they hesitated just a few minutes, and bye bye!
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.201]  You thought it was another drill.
[00:16:59.201 --> 00:17:00.863]  So this is all psych warfare.
[00:17:00.863 --> 00:17:13.654]  Police chiefs are on record admitting they wear the mask, they do it to intimidate, and the message is, you don't pay parking tickets, we're gonna kick your door down and just randomly spray bullets into a few people here and there.
[00:17:13.654 --> 00:17:17.437]  And that's why they support the officers when they do it, the cops aren't.
[00:17:17.777 --> 00:17:18.957]  Psychological warfare people.
[00:17:18.957 --> 00:17:20.898]  They don't know why they're being allowed to do this.
[00:17:20.898 --> 00:17:22.438]  They're all given a false template.
[00:17:22.438 --> 00:17:24.898]  We've all seen the video of them go in the house.
[00:17:24.898 --> 00:17:26.659]  They shoot the little dog.
[00:17:26.659 --> 00:17:27.599]  The people are crying.
[00:17:27.599 --> 00:17:28.719]  Why'd you kill my dog?
[00:17:28.719 --> 00:17:32.820]  And you watch the video of the cops getting off on the pain and the children crying.
[00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:36.461]  I mean, I've played these videos on air and it's demonic.
[00:17:36.461 --> 00:17:41.542]  There's a satanic feasting on the psychic vampire level.
[00:17:42.562 --> 00:17:43.963]  Very wicked.
[00:17:43.963 --> 00:17:45.243]  Very evil.
[00:17:45.243 --> 00:17:47.443]  I'm not saying every SWAT team in history was evil.
[00:17:47.443 --> 00:17:49.424]  Everybody that does this is bad.
[00:17:49.424 --> 00:17:56.706]  But more and more, you see the sadomasochistic, demonic, psychic feasting going on.
[00:17:56.706 --> 00:18:01.887]  Remember, SWAT teams were set up in the late 60s, admittedly, by Gates in Los Angeles.
[00:18:01.887 --> 00:18:04.888]  Special Weapons Attack Teams, not Special Weapons and Tactics.
[00:18:04.888 --> 00:18:06.449]  That's the politically correct name.
[00:18:06.449 --> 00:18:07.729]  The CIA helped set it up.
[00:18:07.729 --> 00:18:11.090]  They're a hostage, rapid reaction force.
[00:18:12.464 --> 00:18:17.426]  Before, they just had guys that had a lot of testosterone and didn't even need a helmet.
[00:18:17.426 --> 00:18:21.148]  They put on some body armor, strap it on, go in and, you know, take out the hostages.
[00:18:21.148 --> 00:18:29.611]  But now they wait two or three hours and creep around at Columbine or every other shooting and then don't help anybody.
[00:18:29.611 --> 00:18:35.834]  I've talked to so many old retired cops and, in fact, one of them owns a
[00:18:38.243 --> 00:18:48.552]  Car repair place here in town, got to know him years ago, became an advertiser locally, and he was just talking about when he was a detective, they just, they just, they didn't need all the gear, they just had testosterone.
[00:18:48.552 --> 00:18:52.656]  But the point is, this is all about, these are death squads now.
[00:18:52.656 --> 00:18:56.540]  That's what they're being phased into, that's what they're being turned into, and it's a tool of intimidation.
[00:18:56.540 --> 00:19:02.024]  So they're saying now, we're gonna go ahead and just make every warrant service a no-knock.
[00:19:02.836 --> 00:19:07.020]  And so you move, you thought you paid off a ticket.
[00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:11.644]  I've had it before where I did pay off a ticket and had to call up courthouses and
[00:19:13.217 --> 00:19:17.840]  It's happened a couple times when it's a, you know, out of county thing and say, you got that check.
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.501]  I've got that cleared check.
[00:19:19.501 --> 00:19:19.921]  I paid it.
[00:19:19.921 --> 00:19:22.823]  They go, well, there was a $10 fee we forgot to assess.
[00:19:22.823 --> 00:19:24.024]  So it's not good.
[00:19:24.024 --> 00:19:24.825]  We sent you a letter.
[00:19:24.825 --> 00:19:25.605]  I'm like, well, I moved.
[00:19:25.605 --> 00:19:26.326]  I must not have gotten it.
[00:19:26.326 --> 00:19:28.027]  Let me pay the other $10 fee.
[00:19:28.027 --> 00:19:32.690]  Well, now for the $10 fee, and there's basically going to convert.
[00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:42.076]  In fact, they are larger and larger brigades of these people at the state level to just come hit down the door.
[00:19:42.076 --> 00:19:42.236]  And if
[00:19:43.958 --> 00:19:48.844]  You always read about the old insurance salesman, retired, gets up, wrong house, they kill him.
[00:19:48.844 --> 00:19:51.887]  92-year-old woman, they kill her.
[00:19:51.887 --> 00:19:53.669]  This Marine, they kill him.
[00:19:53.669 --> 00:19:59.356]  But see, that gives them a propaganda problem, because they teach you to worship the Marines, but now one God has killed another God.
[00:20:00.165 --> 00:20:02.128]  He looks five years younger.
[00:20:02.128 --> 00:20:04.932]  He doesn't fall asleep at his desk like he used to.
[00:20:04.932 --> 00:20:07.676]  He no longer drinks those energy drinks all day.
[00:20:07.676 --> 00:20:09.218]  He used to be gloomy.
[00:20:09.218 --> 00:20:10.279]  Now he's upbeat.
[00:20:10.279 --> 00:20:12.402]  He obviously has lost weight.
[00:20:12.402 --> 00:20:16.027]  He's now drinking Moringa in the Morning from BigJoe.us.
[00:20:16.488 --> 00:20:26.437]  Moringa is a delicious, all-organic, 100% bioavailable blend from the Miracle Moringa Tree, considered by many to be the most nutrient-rich plant ever discovered.
[00:20:26.437 --> 00:20:32.422]  Moringa in the morning will suppress cravings for junk food and energy drinks, and make you feel like a kid again.
[00:20:32.822 --> 00:20:34.403]  Drink Moringa in the Morning.
[00:20:34.403 --> 00:20:36.825]  Available from BigJoe.us.
[00:20:36.825 --> 00:20:40.548]  That's B-I-G-J-O-E dot US.

[00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.711]  That's 800-503-0515.
[00:20:44.711 --> 00:20:46.192]  Drink Moringa in the Morning.

[00:21:29.201 --> 00:21:38.547]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:21:38.547 --> 00:21:39.348]  This capitalism?
[00:21:39.348 --> 00:21:45.592]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:21:45.592 --> 00:21:46.473]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:21:46.473 --> 00:21:49.735]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[00:21:49.735 --> 00:21:50.555]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[00:21:50.555 --> 00:21:51.936]  It's time to understand the system.
[00:21:51.936 --> 00:21:52.256]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:52.256 --> 00:21:52.537]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:22:02.163 --> 00:22:04.484]  Alex Jones here with key information.
[00:22:04.484 --> 00:22:05.044]  The U.S.
[00:22:05.044 --> 00:22:12.328]  government is a Ponzi scheme that relies on the Treasury continuously selling large amounts of government bonds to foreign central banks.
[00:22:12.328 --> 00:22:15.049]  With Japan about to become a seller of U.S.
[00:22:15.049 --> 00:22:18.371]  bonds in order to rebuild its own nation, and the U.S.
[00:22:18.371 --> 00:22:25.034]  antagonizing China by calling them currency manipulators, the Federal Reserve, which is already buying about 70% of U.S.
[00:22:25.034 --> 00:22:27.676]  Treasuries, will soon be the only buyer left of U.S.
[00:22:27.676 --> 00:22:28.116]  Treasuries.
[00:22:28.516 --> 00:22:32.037]  Our friends at the National Inflation Association believe that the U.S.
[00:22:32.037 --> 00:22:37.979]  dollar will soon become worthless and Americans will see the purchasing power of their incomes and savings destroyed.
[00:22:37.979 --> 00:22:46.442]  I strongly urge my fellow Americans to sign up for the free NIA newsletter at www.inflation.us.
[00:22:46.442 --> 00:22:55.785]  If you are sick and tired of the economic propaganda in the mainstream media, sign up for free at inflation.us to learn the economic truth that the mainstream media ignores.
[00:22:59.088 --> 00:23:01.770]  Food prices are spiraling out of control.
[00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:08.154]  In order to survive, you will soon need to produce some or all of your own food in your backyard or small farm.
[00:23:08.154 --> 00:23:17.280]  Many years ago, sought-after radio guest Marjorie Wildcraft and her family began working to find the easiest ways to grow food for the crisis we are now facing.
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:21.303]  Marjorie created a video that is the fastest way to learn how to grow food.
[00:23:21.303 --> 00:23:28.968]  You'll learn the most efficient gardening methods, myths and truths of orchards and edible landscaping, effective predator protection, and even home butchering.
[00:23:29.008 --> 00:23:29.688]  We're good to go.
[00:24:03.402 --> 00:24:24.534]  By any historical yardstick, we are turning into a hardcore police state with an offshore private banking cartel openly robbing us and incrementally turning our police into federalized, merciless goons.
[00:24:26.638 --> 00:24:29.099]  And in the process, the police are destroying their own future.
[00:24:29.099 --> 00:24:31.220]  But I don't even blame the police at the end of the day.
[00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:40.004]  It is the American people that have sat idly by and put up with this that have allowed this to happen.
[00:24:40.004 --> 00:24:43.706]  Now, I started ranting about how they killed this poor Marine.
[00:24:46.795 --> 00:24:48.556]  Again, they saw men looking in the windows.
[00:24:48.556 --> 00:24:49.637]  The children got scared.
[00:24:49.637 --> 00:24:52.018]  This all happened in a matter of 30 seconds.
[00:24:52.018 --> 00:24:53.679]  They busted down the door.
[00:24:53.679 --> 00:24:56.081]  He reportedly didn't get a shot off.
[00:24:56.081 --> 00:25:00.263]  And they just totally shot him full of holes.
[00:25:00.263 --> 00:25:02.444]  And their argument is, well, we got to protect ourselves.
[00:25:02.444 --> 00:25:03.865]  We're trying to stop narcotics.
[00:25:03.865 --> 00:25:07.267]  Well, turns out no drugs found in the house.
[00:25:07.267 --> 00:25:11.269]  And the reports were first it was the wrong house, but which they do all the time.
[00:25:11.269 --> 00:25:12.630]  You see it constantly in the press.
[00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:15.272]  But now they're saying, well, that was the right house.
[00:25:17.878 --> 00:25:30.444]  Kinda like the cops when they put that guy in handcuffs out in Oakland on the train deck, the platform, and then shot him in the back, and then told everybody that he'd fought them and wasn't in handcuffs after they confiscated three cameras.
[00:25:30.444 --> 00:25:35.086]  Turned out somebody was in a train that was stopped and filmed the whole thing.
[00:25:35.086 --> 00:25:41.069]  Somebody else filmed it from about 50 yards away and he was in handcuffs and they just shot him in the back, execution style.
[00:25:41.069 --> 00:25:43.270]  You watch the video, it doesn't look like it was an accident.
[00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:46.292]  He stretches the gun out, shoots him right in the back.
[00:25:47.329 --> 00:25:53.633]  Goes through his back, bounces back up into his heart, and it was suspects of a fight on the train.
[00:25:53.633 --> 00:25:55.454]  Turns out it wasn't even the right guy.
[00:25:55.454 --> 00:25:59.836]  It's like that case in New York of somebody punched a cop at a nightclub.
[00:25:59.836 --> 00:26:03.438]  They set up a checkpoint outside, searched everybody, turned out he was the wrong guy.
[00:26:03.438 --> 00:26:08.901]  And the cops took him to a facility and beat him for eight hours off and on.
[00:26:08.901 --> 00:26:11.743]  And finally some good cops blew the whistle and said that
[00:26:13.044 --> 00:26:21.094]  Their commander sodomized him with a broken toilet plunger continually for two hours.
[00:26:21.094 --> 00:26:24.478]  That shows total psychopathic behavior.
[00:26:24.478 --> 00:26:28.643]  I mean, two hours?
[00:26:28.643 --> 00:26:30.045]  And then blood was pouring out?
[00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:33.061]  I mean, how do you do?
[00:26:33.061 --> 00:26:34.722]  What type of demon?
[00:26:34.722 --> 00:26:37.964]  Even if you were psychopathic, wouldn't it get boring after 30 seconds?
[00:26:37.964 --> 00:26:42.787]  I mean, hours of sodomizing someone with a broken plunger?
[00:26:42.787 --> 00:26:44.288]  I mean, who are they hiring?
[00:26:44.288 --> 00:26:52.814]  The Bill of Rights and Constitution is supposed to protect us from crooks getting into government, boss hogs getting in, and then hiring thugs under them.
[00:26:52.814 --> 00:26:56.397]  To where if boss hog tries to do that, boss hog gets in trouble.
[00:26:57.489 --> 00:26:59.731]  Your county gets out of control, you go to the state.
[00:26:59.731 --> 00:27:01.133]  You go to the Texas Rangers.
[00:27:01.133 --> 00:27:02.134]  They come and deal with it.
[00:27:02.134 --> 00:27:04.916]  They don't deal with it, you vote in new reps.
[00:27:04.916 --> 00:27:06.538]  Same thing with the feds.
[00:27:06.538 --> 00:27:08.960]  But we can't do that anymore.
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:11.783]  And there's all these TV shows just worshipping what they're doing.
[00:27:11.783 --> 00:27:20.972]  I mean, I don't want to get into any more horrible stories of what the police are doing or how many cases of cops sitting outside topless bars pulling over the drunk dancers and demanding sex from them.
[00:27:24.139 --> 00:27:30.605]  There's a big percentage of people that want to be criminals and they're smart enough to go become police officers.
[00:27:30.605 --> 00:27:33.108]  And this is the historical problem.
[00:27:33.108 --> 00:27:39.574]  Everybody knows that about Mexico and other third world countries and Paul Watson was in Tibet.
[00:27:41.039 --> 00:27:45.980]  And try to take some photos just of a mountain gorge and cops, local cops.
[00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:52.302]  It wasn't even the professional from his experiences quite a few times in China, the national police.
[00:27:52.302 --> 00:27:55.502]  It was the local cops came over, demanded a bunch of money for him to take photos.
[00:27:55.502 --> 00:27:58.003]  And then he saw them doing it to other tourists.
[00:27:58.003 --> 00:27:59.183]  This is what happens in Mexico.
[00:27:59.183 --> 00:28:03.564]  I mean, everybody knows in third world countries, the cops are horrible.
[00:28:03.564 --> 00:28:07.205]  And I remember going to third world countries with my parents who were well traveled.
[00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:10.061]  And I'm somewhat well-traveled because of them.
[00:28:10.061 --> 00:28:15.244]  And I remember seeing the cops looking goonish, just as a child, and thinking, they look scary.
[00:28:15.244 --> 00:28:21.728]  But seeing cops in America, and they were usually, you know, tough guys, but, you know, hi, how you doing?
[00:28:21.728 --> 00:28:23.289]  You felt good as a child seeing them.
[00:28:23.289 --> 00:28:26.271]  I remember being in third-world countries, and they were on power trips.
[00:28:26.271 --> 00:28:27.452]  They had that evil look.
[00:28:28.012 --> 00:28:28.833]  I don't know.
[00:28:49.844 --> 00:29:06.942]  I mean, I won't go down to 6th Street at night because they have special units, I guess, who enjoy it, who are like these shaved heads with devil tattoos all over them and black gloves just looking at you, trying to... And it's like flashbacks to college of, like, bouncers showing off, trying to start fights with people for no reason.
[00:29:06.942 --> 00:29:07.843]  And I'm like, what?
[00:29:08.524 --> 00:29:18.475]  I mean you see some guy with big black circles around his eyes and a shaved head and black gloves and he sees good looking girls walking by and he comes over and demands their ID and looks at it and asks them questions.
[00:29:18.475 --> 00:29:21.699]  I mean it's just, it's living in a third world country.
[00:29:21.699 --> 00:29:22.240]  I don't like it.
[00:29:24.178 --> 00:29:31.403]  I mean, you can just look at somebody, if you've got any discernment, generally, and, you know, tell that's a nice person, they have a good vibe.
[00:29:31.403 --> 00:29:35.526]  And you still see cops changing tires on, and it always looks the same.
[00:29:35.526 --> 00:29:42.711]  It's a middle-aged guy, doesn't have a crazy look in his eyes, you know, you don't get a bad feeling.
[00:29:42.711 --> 00:29:47.314]  More and more, it's scary, folks.
[00:29:47.314 --> 00:29:48.575]  Look, I got big news coming up.
[00:29:48.575 --> 00:29:49.256]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:50.697 --> 00:29:53.698]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.698 --> 00:30:00.719]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.719 --> 00:30:07.360]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:12.502]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:30:12.502 --> 00:30:18.803]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:30:21.243 --> 00:30:37.402]  They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit They put a diamond gusset in the crotch Where you need it most Blue diamond gussets got it
[00:30:39.393 --> 00:30:41.534]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:30:41.534 --> 00:30:43.315]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:30:43.315 --> 00:30:46.217]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:30:46.217 --> 00:30:52.822]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.

[00:30:55.544 --> 00:30:57.905]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[00:30:57.905 --> 00:30:58.766]  Others don't.
[00:30:59.875 --> 00:31:04.418]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:31:04.418 --> 00:31:05.338]  Number 1.
[00:31:05.338 --> 00:31:08.761]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:31:08.761 --> 00:31:09.621]  Number 2.
[00:31:09.621 --> 00:31:14.524]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:31:14.524 --> 00:31:15.265]  It's true.
[00:31:15.265 --> 00:31:20.128]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:31:20.128 --> 00:31:20.968]  Number 3.
[00:31:20.968 --> 00:31:24.551]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:31:24.551 --> 00:31:28.253]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:31:28.453 --> 00:31:29.253]  Number 4.
[00:31:29.253 --> 00:31:31.994]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:31:31.994 --> 00:31:35.696]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:31:35.696 --> 00:31:36.476]  Number 5.
[00:31:36.476 --> 00:31:40.618]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:31:40.618 --> 00:31:45.680]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:49.841]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:49.841 --> 00:31:51.642]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[00:31:57.504 --> 00:32:02.486]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:32:02.486 --> 00:32:07.788]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:32:07.788 --> 00:32:09.329]  Saving means to make money.
[00:32:09.329 --> 00:32:18.112]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:32:18.852 --> 00:32:26.394]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:32:26.394 --> 00:32:34.397]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:32:34.397 --> 00:32:39.618]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[00:32:39.618 --> 00:32:41.779]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:47.482]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:17.346 --> 00:33:19.408]  All right, let me cover a smattering of key news.
[00:33:19.408 --> 00:33:21.650]  I'm getting into our big birther bombshell.
[00:33:21.650 --> 00:33:27.274]  Corsi released evidence proving Obama's certificate a fraudulent composite.
[00:33:27.274 --> 00:33:35.101]  And you add that to what the White House did yesterday through their minions putting out a hoax dealing with Corsi's WorldNetDaily book.
[00:33:35.101 --> 00:33:37.483]  By the way, we sell at InfoWars.com.
[00:33:37.483 --> 00:33:39.424]  Where's the birth certificate?
[00:33:39.424 --> 00:33:41.086]  They're definitely running scared.
[00:33:41.086 --> 00:33:44.889]  And more and more, they're hiding something.
[00:33:44.949 --> 00:33:49.875]  And remember, I was getting criticized two and a half years ago because I was like, I don't know where he was born.
[00:33:49.875 --> 00:33:57.243]  And then I was like, well, he did, his name did get changed to Barry Sotero and he was listed as Muslim.
[00:33:57.243 --> 00:33:58.385]  And he lied about that.
[00:33:58.385 --> 00:34:00.707]  Uh, doesn't matter if he's Muslim or not.
[00:34:00.707 --> 00:34:04.532]  The point is he's lying about it in Indonesia, had to get up, give up a citizenship.
[00:34:05.697 --> 00:34:09.739]  I'm going to be breaking that down, because it's very important.
[00:34:09.739 --> 00:34:18.223]  By the way, Dr. Jerome Corcido is joining us tomorrow, and I believe tomorrow is the day he's going to roll out his quote proof of this, but we've already seen the proof.
[00:34:18.223 --> 00:34:28.268]  The curing, the computer manipulation, areas that are highly pixelated and low-res, areas that are high-res, 100% proof they went in and altered it.
[00:34:28.268 --> 00:34:29.929]  And it's done shoddily.
[00:34:29.929 --> 00:34:33.510]  So there's two different scenarios there.
[00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:34.731]  I'm going to break it down in a moment.
[00:34:36.778 --> 00:34:41.580]  You notice all at once they're going, yeah, your phone's tracking you and everything you're doing.
[00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:58.805]  Yeah, there's government and corporate kill switches and all the major new electronic devices, not just phones and computers, washers, dryers, light bulbs, the fluorescence, data down power line is able to then use them as a flicker switch to activate and hack into your computers.
[00:34:58.805 --> 00:34:59.946]  That's associated press.
[00:35:00.646 --> 00:35:02.687]  I mean, you can't make this stuff up.
[00:35:02.687 --> 00:35:04.428]  A total control grid going in.
[00:35:04.428 --> 00:35:14.513]  As I told you years ago, they're now announcing government break-ins over radio, TV, internet, cell phones, 9,000 telescreens going in saying, title on your neighbors.
[00:35:14.513 --> 00:35:18.235]  I mean, it's like they're following 1984 as if it was a script.
[00:35:20.157 --> 00:35:31.265]  And on top of that, they're building threat fusion centers everywhere, openly having regular Army, National Guard, Marine Corps checkpoints, totally illegal.
[00:35:31.265 --> 00:35:36.388]  National Guard arresting thousands in New York alone, New York State.
[00:35:36.388 --> 00:35:39.030]  I have that local Fox News cast, how great it is.
[00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:41.732]  They drive you through the high-powered x-rays.
[00:35:42.492 --> 00:35:43.253]  Which are deadly.
[00:35:43.253 --> 00:35:45.194]  It shows the troops standing around them.
[00:35:45.194 --> 00:35:48.776]  And we help arrest 2,000 people for drugs and guns.
[00:35:48.776 --> 00:35:50.777]  Just all of it off the chart.
[00:35:50.777 --> 00:35:52.999]  Oh look, the armies of the Kentucky Derby.
[00:35:52.999 --> 00:35:56.021]  They're arresting people that get in fights and stuff.
[00:35:56.021 --> 00:35:57.561]  You know, in the parking lot who are drunk.
[00:35:57.561 --> 00:35:58.802]  And then they show it on the news.
[00:35:58.802 --> 00:36:01.264]  I mean, it's a full PSYOP rollout.
[00:36:02.088 --> 00:36:21.702]  And as I told you over a decade ago, when they got rid of Glass-Steagall, when we had George Humphrey and other economists on, they were going to create massive trillions, now over 1,000 trillion conservatively, in fraudulent debt, have our traitor government, bipartisan, sign on to that debt that they created, that we don't owe, as a ball and chain.
[00:36:21.702 --> 00:36:23.623]  It's time to break the chains.
[00:36:23.623 --> 00:36:30.308]  It's time to take the balls to the walls and go all the way and take the wrecking balls and knock down this modern Berlin Wall of the mind.
[00:36:31.212 --> 00:36:36.875]  And it's time for police, military, bureaucrats, those that serve the system, to break the trance.
[00:36:36.875 --> 00:36:38.516]  This is not for security.
[00:36:38.516 --> 00:36:39.497]  This is not good.
[00:36:39.497 --> 00:36:41.318]  This is a criminal government.
[00:36:41.318 --> 00:36:45.661]  And it's way bigger than Barack Obama.
[00:36:45.661 --> 00:36:51.224]  Let's get that straight.
[00:36:51.224 --> 00:36:52.365]  Guys, I forgot to get a water.
[00:36:52.365 --> 00:36:53.125]  Will you get me one, please?
[00:36:53.125 --> 00:36:55.347]  Just because I don't want to start hacking here on air.
[00:36:55.347 --> 00:36:55.647]  Thank you.
[00:36:59.735 --> 00:37:04.056]  For some reason, coffee just doesn't seem to stop you from coughing.
[00:37:04.056 --> 00:37:05.456]  Thank you.
[00:37:05.456 --> 00:37:12.758]  Now, that said, here's just some of the police state news, just some of it.
[00:37:12.758 --> 00:37:14.958]  You know, Indiana last week and the U.S.
[00:37:14.958 --> 00:37:20.239]  Supreme Court separately both ruled that there's no Fourth Amendment.
[00:37:20.239 --> 00:37:24.640]  And the Indiana ruling gives me chills every time I read it.
[00:37:25.774 --> 00:37:27.896]  It is so criminal.
[00:37:27.896 --> 00:37:35.945]  It is so bold that the Chief Justice said that the police can go in your house without a warrant for any reason or no reason at all.
[00:37:36.883 --> 00:37:39.384]  I mean, it is not any more broad than that.
[00:37:39.384 --> 00:37:45.767]  And then suddenly, all over the news, they're saying, yes, we've only been doing a few thousand a year, which is a lot.
[00:37:45.767 --> 00:37:47.248]  Now they're going to expand.
[00:37:47.248 --> 00:37:56.992]  And now even local jurisdictions, not just federal court, are going to issue sneak-and-peeks for the cops to go in your house when you don't even know they're there.
[00:37:57.947 --> 00:38:03.011]  With this mass roving ground warrant.
[00:38:03.011 --> 00:38:06.634]  Kind of like the fake warrants judges have been swearing out under federal grants.
[00:38:06.634 --> 00:38:12.978]  The states accept the grants and the judges get behind it in the political jurisdictions that are particularly treasonous like Austin.
[00:38:12.978 --> 00:38:16.001]  And they take blood at checkpoints without a warrant.
[00:38:16.721 --> 00:38:27.265]  And my real estate lawyer is a well-known former high-level state judge, and I was in his office last year, and he brought that ruling up to me, and he just said, I can't believe America's turned into this.
[00:38:27.265 --> 00:38:29.246]  He just says, we're in a lot of trouble.
[00:38:29.246 --> 00:38:31.027]  The bottom has dropped out.
[00:38:31.027 --> 00:38:33.268]  And that, of course, is a legal term.
[00:38:33.268 --> 00:38:40.591]  There's nothing holding them back now except our moral courage to stand up and to get good people into government to reverse these courts.
[00:38:40.591 --> 00:38:43.652]  I mean, the chains have been broken by the tyrants.
[00:38:43.652 --> 00:38:44.573]  The dragon is loose.
[00:38:45.424 --> 00:38:51.508]  And they're chaining us down with bureaucracy and propaganda and economic degradation.
[00:38:51.508 --> 00:38:54.410]  We'd better break the chains now because they're adding more chains every day.
[00:38:57.042 --> 00:39:03.307]  But an Indiana Sheriff at Illinois Gun, great folks have written this op-ed piece for us.
[00:39:03.307 --> 00:39:09.211]  Indiana Sheriff, house-to-house random search is now possible.
[00:39:09.211 --> 00:39:13.715]  And it's got reports, links to his reports and his press releases.
[00:39:13.715 --> 00:39:18.519]  And they're openly saying now they can do door-to-door gun sweeps.
[00:39:20.151 --> 00:39:29.575]  And that's two years ago, we had the Army Colonel on, regular Army, big Army, on from Iowa, in Arcadia.
[00:39:29.575 --> 00:39:42.340]  And it was in the local paper, it said, the local gun shop owner has agreed to play the part of an American terrorist, and we're gonna raid his gun shop, and then we're gonna search citizens' homes for guns.
[00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:48.423]  We're gonna barricade and blockade the town of 700, and we're going to search every home.
[00:39:49.759 --> 00:39:52.704]  And the citizens have agreed to let us go into their homes.
[00:39:57.671 --> 00:39:58.972]  They're doing these drills everywhere.
[00:39:58.972 --> 00:40:17.965]  I mean, they're really trying to run the military men and women through these drills to where they just get normalized and go, well, I've, I've done this drill, you know, 15, 20 times and they drill the military, uh, National Guard, regular, uh, full-time military with police all over.
[00:40:17.965 --> 00:40:22.788]  We have countless newscasts we've linked to on the website where local news is saying how great it is.
[00:40:22.788 --> 00:40:27.231]  And the role players are constitutionalist and they practice killing us.
[00:40:28.291 --> 00:40:37.573]  I mean, this criminal government is in full-scale, at least 20-year preparation for all-out war, and now they hit the afterburners.
[00:40:37.573 --> 00:40:45.035]  I mean, it's increased the last two years by a magnitude of about, I reckon, 20 times.
[00:40:45.035 --> 00:40:48.116]  I mean, it's an exponential jump.
[00:40:50.618 --> 00:40:55.644]  And I've told folks this years ago, I might get chills once a year when I looked at an article or covered something.
[00:40:55.644 --> 00:40:59.848]  I'm getting chills every five minutes on this show now.
[00:40:59.848 --> 00:41:10.639]  I mean, look at the hair standing up on my arm because at an instinctive level, just like when you're brought to the edge of a cliff, my body's going, whoa, my guts are going, whoa, something big is on.
[00:41:11.468 --> 00:41:18.071]  And they positioned us for this economic collapse all along and they're going to stage terror attacks to blame them on domestic groups.
[00:41:18.071 --> 00:41:23.834]  We even have White House memos advising how great a domestic terror attack would be, how it would help the president.
[00:41:23.834 --> 00:41:29.777]  And they are clearly getting ready to try to use their internet takeover switches, all of it.
[00:41:29.777 --> 00:41:31.939]  They are moving towards this.
[00:41:33.936 --> 00:41:34.697]  We're good to go.
[00:41:56.727 --> 00:42:01.571]  More than 7 million people starved to death or died from complications of malnutrition.
[00:42:01.571 --> 00:42:05.955]  And that's when 90% of the country lived on farms and was somewhat self-sufficient.
[00:42:05.955 --> 00:42:08.337]  10% live in rural areas now, or farms.
[00:42:08.337 --> 00:42:11.459]  Half of those are self-sufficient.
[00:42:11.459 --> 00:42:15.743]  Now there is a middle class flight.
[00:42:15.743 --> 00:42:22.188]  It's predominantly white, but there's also a lot of other folks who are middle class and educated, who know history, and they are running.
[00:42:22.188 --> 00:42:23.409]  I can't tell you, you go out to
[00:42:25.848 --> 00:42:41.799]  These towns around Austin, it's doctors, it's lawyers, it's psychologists, psychiatrists, it's former military officers, and you walk into any little store and every person comes up to me.
[00:42:41.799 --> 00:42:47.803]  A lot of them who previously didn't even know who I was and years ago moved out to these towns.
[00:42:47.803 --> 00:42:50.165]  And they know full well, historically, what's coming.
[00:42:51.022 --> 00:42:54.585]  And it was more reports in Russia and more reports in the U.S.
[00:42:54.585 --> 00:43:03.412]  where bunker building quietly in the bottom of houses in the wealthy, particularly former government people, is just off the charts.
[00:43:03.412 --> 00:43:04.613]  Why?
[00:43:04.613 --> 00:43:11.159]  Why is every major police department basically hardening their facilities?
[00:43:11.159 --> 00:43:14.842]  This has all been planned.
[00:43:14.842 --> 00:43:18.465]  And I am so sad for everybody because it's going to be rough.
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:35.963]  Now, if we were able to have a big enough political awakening in this country and really stood down the globalists and used the alternative media while we've still got time to let them know that we're aware of what they're doing and checkmate them, they may back off.
[00:43:35.963 --> 00:43:42.744]  But the globalists are masters at committing their forces, betting it all in, double downing.
[00:43:42.744 --> 00:43:47.585]  And they pretty much have already put this collapse into motion.
[00:43:47.585 --> 00:43:49.085]  It's very hard for them to pull out of it.
[00:43:50.521 --> 00:44:06.688]  And so they create a political atmosphere where things are going to break down so bad that there'll be riots in many cities, cities will burn, sections of cities will burn, and you will want the military on the streets.
[00:44:06.688 --> 00:44:15.972]  See, they're masters at setting the table, setting the dominoes where you'll actually want them to do it.
[00:44:17.059 --> 00:44:29.491]  And then they'll actually come in and do a good job of shutting things down, shutting riots down, that are just looting, you know, behavior of destitute welfare folks and others.
[00:44:30.626 --> 00:44:32.567]  And that's what they've done in countless third world countries.
[00:44:32.567 --> 00:44:36.468]  It's in the 112 point IMF World Bank Shock Doctrine Plan.
[00:44:36.468 --> 00:44:38.388]  How they implode it at the first level.
[00:44:38.388 --> 00:44:43.770]  Riots start because of no food and because of prices going up under hyperinflation.
[00:44:43.770 --> 00:44:50.092]  Then they come in and crack down and the middle class has no choice but to basically go with the establishment.
[00:44:50.092 --> 00:44:53.413]  I mean, it's all been socially engineered out.
[00:44:53.413 --> 00:44:53.653]  Okay?
[00:44:55.056 --> 00:44:58.647]  And it's the end of America.
[00:44:58.647 --> 00:45:01.115]  Everybody can see it, you can feel it, you can know it.
[00:45:02.140 --> 00:45:05.061]  And there's some different wild cards, though.
[00:45:05.061 --> 00:45:06.702]  A lot of people are still self-sufficient.
[00:45:06.702 --> 00:45:10.383]  There's so much stored up old wealth in the middle class.
[00:45:10.383 --> 00:45:11.323]  There's guns.
[00:45:11.323 --> 00:45:15.965]  There's a lot of counties and cities that are under the control of real Americans still.
[00:45:15.965 --> 00:45:21.846]  There's a lot of people in the military and the police establishment and the bureaucracy that understand what's happening.
[00:45:21.846 --> 00:45:29.289]  We're not going to be as easy as Mexico or Brazil or Nigeria or Indonesia.
[00:45:30.399 --> 00:45:33.441]  It is not going to be as easy.
[00:45:33.441 --> 00:45:43.729]  Now, the system is going to stage terror attacks, and they're getting ready with the preparatory phase, with 60 Minutes and all these other shows, saying, those that don't like the Federal Reserve are cop killers, look out, they're gonna blow stuff up.
[00:45:43.729 --> 00:45:44.950]  Oklahoma City's coming.
[00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:50.795]  So they're already pre-scripting with the soccer moms and folks, hey, there's McVeys everywhere, they're about to bomb you.
[00:45:50.795 --> 00:45:55.939]  Show that as the real Americans, as this implosion accelerates, stand up and get more credibility,
[00:45:57.697 --> 00:45:59.438]  90% of warfare is psychological.
[00:45:59.438 --> 00:46:00.759]  The globalists have no qualms.
[00:46:00.759 --> 00:46:03.041]  They're beyond evil.
[00:46:03.041 --> 00:46:07.765]  They will trigger events knowing we've got the moral high ground to be blamed on us.
[00:46:07.765 --> 00:46:11.388]  And you need to understand, it's not the helicopters, the tanks.
[00:46:11.388 --> 00:46:15.171]  Most of the people in the helicopters and tanks are on our side.
[00:46:15.171 --> 00:46:18.274]  And that's evidenced by the different surveys that have been done.
[00:46:18.274 --> 00:46:19.955]  Will you fire on Americans?
[00:46:19.955 --> 00:46:22.758]  Evidenced by Ron Paul getting the most political contributions of anybody.
[00:46:22.758 --> 00:46:24.859]  In fact, the majority from serving military.
[00:46:25.925 --> 00:46:26.985]  I don't
[00:46:49.087 --> 00:46:53.232]  When I'm driving, I do this when I lay in bed at night, then I can tell exactly what they'll do.
[00:46:53.232 --> 00:46:54.533]  And I'm not giving them ideas.
[00:46:54.533 --> 00:46:56.015]  They've done this before.
[00:46:56.015 --> 00:46:59.919]  They'll stage massacres of cops, military, to try to really get them fired up.
[00:46:59.919 --> 00:47:02.302]  Well, we'll get those patriots.
[00:47:02.302 --> 00:47:07.508]  They like to target federal buildings that'll have a daycare in them.
[00:47:07.508 --> 00:47:08.810]  That's why Oklahoma City was chosen.
[00:47:10.385 --> 00:47:12.867]  Um, and that's what came out in the sworn affidavits.
[00:47:12.867 --> 00:47:25.194]  McVeigh, who thought he was setting up patriots, got mad when they picked one with a daycare center and threw a fit, went rogue, and they definitely then decided, if he wasn't already the patsy, that he was the guy they were going to burn at that point when he said, I'm not going to blow up kids.
[00:47:25.194 --> 00:47:28.596]  And they said, well, you just don't get this, do you, pal?
[00:47:28.596 --> 00:47:33.379]  Of course, Operation Gladio in Italy in the 70s and early 80s, declassified CIA ran,
[00:47:34.784 --> 00:47:42.391]  Stage bombings of school buses and things like that, because there's nothing better on a newscast than some bloody kids in a fireman's arms.
[00:47:42.391 --> 00:47:56.303]  So, we outnumber the globalists hundreds to one conservatively, but they still can play the dirty tricks, and the public is still somewhat naive enough to buy it.
[00:47:56.303 --> 00:48:01.068]  And I just want you to understand what we're going into, and I want you to know what's happening.
[00:48:02.458 --> 00:48:16.067]  There are some real ultra low intensity attacks that are carried out always by people who have been assessed by the government psychologist on staff at the prisons.
[00:48:16.067 --> 00:48:25.434]  Then when they're released, they'll even release them early, they have a handler that comes in and tries to trick the low IQ mentally ill person to go out and try to bomb something.
[00:48:25.434 --> 00:48:29.497]  But they're so stupid that they're never ever really to carry out a big attack.
[00:48:30.257 --> 00:48:31.697]  And that's even come out last year in the news.
[00:48:31.697 --> 00:48:39.379]  The FBI in eight different cases set up people, created the groups, tried to get them to carry out attacks, but they're so dumb they can't, generally.
[00:48:39.379 --> 00:48:44.980]  That's why the globalists will have to go with real attacks.
[00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:47.521]  Or they'll hire a fence group.
[00:48:47.521 --> 00:48:51.221]  They'll fence it through a group like the Weathermen, which later came out were government operatives.
[00:48:51.221 --> 00:48:53.682]  That's why Bill Clinton pardoned even some of the patsies.
[00:48:55.396 --> 00:48:55.596]  I think?
[00:49:14.118 --> 00:49:15.479]  Bill Clinton will tell us what the truth is.
[00:49:15.479 --> 00:49:17.301]  He's so truthful.
[00:49:17.301 --> 00:49:18.782]  And Ron Paul says U.S.
[00:49:18.782 --> 00:49:21.365]  may try to occupy Pakistan.
[00:49:21.365 --> 00:49:22.165]  Well, absolutely.
[00:49:22.165 --> 00:49:23.967]  That's ongoing.
[00:49:23.967 --> 00:49:31.594]  Bin Laden's latest audio tape praises globalist-engineered fake revolutions.
[00:49:31.594 --> 00:49:34.197]  And I was just watching Obama at a press conference during the last break.
[00:49:35.851 --> 00:49:42.856]  He said the people are rising up against tyranny, rising up for their rights in these Arab nations.
[00:49:42.856 --> 00:49:58.766]  And in Syria, in Libya, and in Egypt, in every case it's now admitted that these groups, the Muslim Brotherhood and Al-Qaeda affiliated groups, were openly funded by the State Department and sent in
[00:50:00.385 --> 00:50:09.521]  And here's the latest Bin Laden tape that they got from the rat hole, supposedly, and it's praising the revolutions.
[00:50:11.431 --> 00:50:28.041]  And they've been proven to release all these fake audiotapes and videotapes before, but just magically it praises it, now giving it the Al-Qaeda seal of approval for these groups so the globalists can even stir up a horde of organic people to basically use like patsies against others.
[00:50:28.041 --> 00:50:38.368]  And so here's Bin Laden and Obama agreeing with each other and saying how great these revolutions are and how great freedom fighters they are.
[00:50:39.830 --> 00:50:41.332]  And how it needs to be supported.
[00:50:41.332 --> 00:50:44.034]  So Bin Laden's saying, oh you're great.
[00:50:44.034 --> 00:50:45.295]  And so is Obama.
[00:50:45.295 --> 00:50:46.637]  Obama's saying, oh you're great.
[00:50:49.435 --> 00:50:56.882]  And there's now intel coming out that they may use their Taliban Al Qaeda groups in Pakistan to try to overthrow that government.
[00:50:56.882 --> 00:51:00.025]  Kind of like they used them in 53 against the Iranians.
[00:51:00.025 --> 00:51:00.506]  You gotta love it.
[00:51:00.506 --> 00:51:02.267]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:51:02.267 --> 00:51:10.515]  The earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster that killed thousands of Japanese citizens is nothing compared to the devastation that could be caused by hyperinflation.
[00:51:10.555 --> 00:51:11.055]  I think so.
[00:51:34.375 --> 00:51:34.735]  We're good.
[00:52:00.385 --> 00:52:05.587]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:53:00.123 --> 00:53:01.443]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:53:01.443 --> 00:53:07.025]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:53:07.025 --> 00:53:12.047]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:53:12.047 --> 00:53:12.507]  It's true.
[00:53:12.507 --> 00:53:17.069]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:53:17.609 --> 00:53:22.833]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:53:22.833 --> 00:53:29.957]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:53:29.957 --> 00:53:31.078]  And here's the best part.
[00:53:31.078 --> 00:53:37.442]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:53:37.742 --> 00:53:40.944]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:53:40.944 --> 00:53:43.166]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:53:43.166 --> 00:53:44.106]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:53:44.106 --> 00:53:44.307]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:53:44.307 --> 00:53:47.749]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:53:47.749 --> 00:53:49.490]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:54:00.492 --> 00:54:07.518]  Here's another psychological warfare example.
[00:54:27.705 --> 00:54:35.229]  The headline reads, panic at Minnesota airport when TSA conducts drill and doesn't tell police.
[00:54:35.229 --> 00:54:42.573]  Or other headlines, panic at high school when police don't tell teachers or students it's a hostage taking drill.
[00:54:42.573 --> 00:54:51.577]  They don't ever want to announce these to create the psychological fear and the perception in the community that there are real terrorists threatening you.
[00:54:51.577 --> 00:54:53.638]  Okay?
[00:54:53.638 --> 00:54:56.620]  And I was just watching more of Obama's speech that's ongoing.
[00:54:58.971 --> 00:55:13.481]  Every time Bush or Obama is launching a new anti-terror initiative, Al Qaeda releases text or videos or generally audio agreeing with whatever they're saying.
[00:55:13.481 --> 00:55:21.026]  Agreeing with global warming being real, saying how great the rebels are that are globalist backed.
[00:55:21.026 --> 00:55:23.668]  Going along with the official story, just like Al Qaeda came out
[00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:26.841]  On a message board?
[00:55:26.841 --> 00:55:33.787]  Oh, somebody said on a message board that Bin Laden is dead, and it's true, and just like Obama said, it's all true.
[00:55:33.787 --> 00:55:36.229]  I mean, it's so ridiculous.
[00:55:36.229 --> 00:55:43.195]  And then I get emails, and I see comments on our YouTube videos, saying, oh, Alex, what do you got to say now?
[00:55:43.195 --> 00:55:46.858]  You're discredited.
[00:55:46.858 --> 00:55:49.199]  Al-Qaeda has come out and admitted he's dead.
[00:55:49.199 --> 00:55:49.580]  Oh, really?
[00:55:49.580 --> 00:55:50.521]  On a message board?
[00:55:50.521 --> 00:55:50.821]  Really?
[00:55:52.370 --> 00:55:58.716]  I mean, I could go on some Arabic message board and say that I was Santa Claus and that I admit to coming down people's chimneys at night.
[00:55:58.716 --> 00:56:04.040]  Is the Associated Press going to run with headlines with it?
[00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:12.288]  And coming up in the next hour, ahead of our guest, I'm going to spend a lot of time on the economy,
[00:56:14.363 --> 00:56:25.413]  I'm going to spend a lot of time on Iran and Pakistan and the fact that more and more the Pentagon is moving towards a full-out occupation of Pakistan.
[00:56:25.413 --> 00:56:26.454]  Ron Paul is now warning.
[00:56:26.454 --> 00:56:28.356]  That's the scuttlebutt in Congress.
[00:56:28.356 --> 00:56:32.880]  That video and press release is up on PresidentPanda.com and Infowars.com.
[00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:34.182]  Ron Paul, U.S., Maine.
[00:56:34.182 --> 00:56:35.403]  Try to occupy Pakistan.
[00:56:35.403 --> 00:56:39.447]  But speaking of hoaxes, this is a classic tactic.
[00:56:40.609 --> 00:56:45.551]  The media will come out and say, everyone knows Alex Jones is discredited.
[00:56:45.551 --> 00:56:49.213]  Or everyone knows Ron Paul's discredited.
[00:56:49.213 --> 00:56:56.175]  Everyone knows the moon is made of Swiss cheese.
[00:56:56.175 --> 00:57:04.699]  And Esquire, which I've noticed is the particular mouthpiece of the White House for Democratic White Houses attacking people and putting out disinfo.
[00:57:05.942 --> 00:57:06.963]  Breaking!
[00:57:06.963 --> 00:57:28.665]  Jerome Corsi's birther book pulled from shelves, and they put this out yesterday, one of their news reporters, breaking politics section, saying that Joseph Farah had cussed out Dr. Jerome Corsi, that he called all the bookstores and said, recall them, voluntarily send them back to me, I'm having them destroyed, contact World Net Daily, we'll give you your money back.
[00:57:30.267 --> 00:57:30.467]  What's
[00:57:50.523 --> 00:57:55.645]  That's like the New York Post saying Jesse Ventura had backed off of his claim that Bin Laden had been dead for years.
[00:57:55.645 --> 00:57:56.466]  We got Ventura on.
[00:57:56.466 --> 00:57:58.087]  He said, I never said that.
[00:57:58.087 --> 00:57:58.747]  Where's the source?
[00:57:58.747 --> 00:58:00.508]  There was no source.
[00:58:00.508 --> 00:58:03.209]  This is thinking of you as an idiot.
[00:58:03.209 --> 00:58:05.930]  This is insulting your intelligence.
[00:58:05.930 --> 00:58:07.631]  And so it's meant to bankrupt them.
[00:58:07.631 --> 00:58:10.172]  It's meant to create the illusion that they're discredited.
[00:58:10.172 --> 00:58:13.554]  And Farah came out and said, this is absolutely made up.
[00:58:13.554 --> 00:58:15.015]  And he's going to have to sue them now.
[00:58:15.015 --> 00:58:16.015]  He has to.
[00:58:16.015 --> 00:58:18.216]  He's been economically damaged big time.
[00:58:18.216 --> 00:58:19.257]  He's got to get his honor.
[00:58:22.029 --> 00:58:33.055]  And they panicked yesterday evening after this being up all day, or up for a long time, and came out and said, it's satire.
[00:58:33.055 --> 00:58:35.216]  See?
[00:58:35.216 --> 00:58:38.197]  That's because the White House is scared of this birth certificate issue.
[00:58:38.197 --> 00:58:38.937]  We're gonna break it down.
[00:58:38.937 --> 00:58:48.102]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:51.713 --> 00:58:55.717]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:58:55.717 --> 00:58:58.961]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:58:58.961 --> 00:59:03.766]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:59:03.766 --> 00:59:10.172]  We have tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:59:10.172 --> 00:59:12.395]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:59:12.935 --> 00:59:13.415]  Tim Geithner?
[00:59:13.415 --> 00:59:13.756]  Bernanke?
[00:59:13.756 --> 00:59:14.416]  They're arsonists!
[00:59:14.416 --> 00:59:15.517]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:59:15.517 --> 00:59:17.938]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:59:31.826 --> 00:59:33.947]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:59:33.947 --> 00:59:39.110]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:59:39.110 --> 00:59:53.359]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:59:53.359 --> 00:59:55.740]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.740 --> 00:59:58.522]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.219 --> 01:00:10.043]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.043 --> 01:00:11.645]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.645 --> 01:00:13.186]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.186 --> 01:00:17.370]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.370 --> 01:00:21.434]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.048 --> 01:00:36.473]  I want to, in one swath, in the next segment, get into Arthur Bombshell, Cora Citi released evidence proving Obama's certificate a fraudulent composite.
[01:00:36.473 --> 01:00:41.896]  This key article from yesterday afternoon by Paul Watson, um,
[01:00:43.311 --> 01:00:46.213]  Has already scrolled off the front page of InfoWars.com.
[01:00:46.213 --> 01:00:50.116]  It's at the bottom of the featured news area of PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:00:50.116 --> 01:00:56.840]  I think I'm gonna have one of my writers repost it as the top link on InfoWars.com because it's so important.
[01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:58.581]  And we do have a video coming out.
[01:00:58.581 --> 01:01:02.084]  It'll be at the top of the Alex Jones Channel sometime this afternoon.
[01:01:02.084 --> 01:01:04.985]  It'll be at the top of InfoWars and Prison Planet.
[01:01:04.985 --> 01:01:08.808]  A key 10-minute video I shot last night up till about midnight.
[01:01:08.808 --> 01:01:12.731]  Aaron stayed up adding documentation to it all evening.
[01:01:13.791 --> 01:01:22.216]  All night until this morning and now he's busy converting it and dumping it down and getting it ready.
[01:01:22.216 --> 01:01:23.437]  So that's coming up.
[01:01:23.437 --> 01:01:24.478]  And why is this important?
[01:01:26.061 --> 01:01:26.662]  I don't think so.
[01:01:45.698 --> 01:01:49.282]  And at this rate, we'll probably have about 10 million views the next year.
[01:01:49.282 --> 01:01:52.504]  We've got some videos with that many views.
[01:01:52.504 --> 01:01:59.671]  And on Google, in the top 10 searches on the Obama birth certificate is that one video.
[01:01:59.671 --> 01:02:02.594]  Now that's a video I shot the day he released it.
[01:02:02.594 --> 01:02:05.997]  We just looked at it, hoping it was real because we wanted to move on.
[01:02:07.683 --> 01:02:10.025]  And, well, I'm gonna talk about when we come back.
[01:02:10.025 --> 01:02:16.989]  It's just this new video, I haven't figured out the title yet, but I need to do that in the next hour or so so I can get it uploaded.
[01:02:16.989 --> 01:02:18.029]  It's encoding right now.
[01:02:18.029 --> 01:02:23.253]  I need to come up with a headline that describes what's happened here.
[01:02:23.253 --> 01:02:29.857]  And I asked my crew, White House running scared?
[01:02:29.857 --> 01:02:35.100]  White House launches dirty tricks?
[01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:36.400]  Inverse certificate coverup?
[01:02:41.596 --> 01:02:46.459]  You know, more proof, Obama birth certificate fake.
[01:02:46.459 --> 01:02:47.979]  I mean, I don't know what we call it.
[01:02:47.979 --> 01:02:49.020]  I mean, what do you call?
[01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:51.721]  I'm about to cover when we come back.
[01:02:51.721 --> 01:02:57.665]  The White House has come out saying it's one of their main campaign issues because they don't want to focus on the real issues.
[01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:03.182]  You got Corsi coming out, and he wouldn't say this unless he had the proof.
[01:03:03.182 --> 01:03:03.742]  We've looked at it.
[01:03:03.742 --> 01:03:09.184]  We have the proof, but that it's a composite of multiple real birth certificates.
[01:03:09.184 --> 01:03:14.627]  That's what we said weeks ago from our research.
[01:03:14.627 --> 01:03:17.808]  Esquire putting out this fake story, breaking drum.
[01:03:17.808 --> 01:03:21.970]  Corsi's birth birth or book pulled from shelves.
[01:03:21.970 --> 01:03:24.851]  And even when they had to add that it was satire later, they did it at the bottom.
[01:03:30.418 --> 01:03:33.319]  I'm going to read this article when we come back.
[01:03:33.319 --> 01:03:34.119]  This is the issue.
[01:03:34.119 --> 01:03:41.841]  If it's discredited and it's dead and buried, why are they going whole hog after Corsi?
[01:03:41.841 --> 01:03:46.822]  Why is the White House in ABC News going after him yesterday, right when this new thing comes out?
[01:03:46.822 --> 01:03:48.223]  They are scared to death.
[01:03:51.613 --> 01:03:54.454]  We've got a lot of new books and videos at InfoWars.com.
[01:03:54.454 --> 01:03:56.674]  This one I think is the best for waking up newbies.
[01:03:56.674 --> 01:03:58.095]  Great animated film.
[01:03:58.095 --> 01:03:59.055]  The American Dream.

[01:04:12.738 --> 01:04:13.418]  End of the Fire.
[01:04:13.418 --> 01:04:17.239]  Invisible Empire by Jason Bermas.
[01:04:17.239 --> 01:04:19.200]  Big Brother by Mark Dice.
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:19.560]  Excellent.
[01:04:20.404 --> 01:04:25.327]  Tara's new book, 63 documents, you can get those together and get one of my films free.
[01:04:25.327 --> 01:04:26.847]  And where's the birth certificate?
[01:04:26.847 --> 01:04:31.350]  The case that Barack Obama is not eligible to be president.
[01:04:31.350 --> 01:04:34.852]  Well, just on the Indonesia citizenship issue, that's the big one.
[01:04:34.852 --> 01:04:40.755]  Number one New York Times bestselling author, the Obama Nation, and senior staff reporter for WorldNetDaily.
[01:04:40.755 --> 01:04:46.198]  And we've got these available and discounted at InfoWars.com right now if you want to get the book.
[01:04:49.403 --> 01:04:50.744]  Very, very important information.
[01:04:50.744 --> 01:04:52.184]  Of course, he's joining us tomorrow.
[01:04:52.184 --> 01:04:57.907]  Okay, I'm going to get into all of this on the other side, then Dr. Paul Craig Roberts joining us, and then Dr. Steve Pachenik as well.
[01:04:57.907 --> 01:05:00.488]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:00.488 --> 01:05:03.489]  It could never happen in America, but it's happening right now.
[01:05:03.489 --> 01:05:07.111]  Gas prices are exploding past the incomes of millions of families.
[01:05:07.111 --> 01:05:12.133]  As gas prices and crop failures push high food costs, you can still get the best food on the planet from

[01:06:00.452 --> 01:06:01.633]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:06:01.633 --> 01:06:08.557]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:06:08.557 --> 01:06:11.119]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:06:11.119 --> 01:06:16.503]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:06:16.503 --> 01:06:19.545]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:06:19.545 --> 01:06:21.586]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:06:21.846 --> 01:06:28.090]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:06:28.090 --> 01:06:31.473]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:06:31.473 --> 01:06:37.257]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:06:37.257 --> 01:06:38.898]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:06:38.898 --> 01:06:40.199]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:06:40.199 --> 01:06:42.881]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:06:42.881 --> 01:06:44.282]  He explains everything you need to know.

[01:07:02.911 --> 01:07:08.217]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:07:08.217 --> 01:07:09.759]  Saving means to make money.
[01:07:09.759 --> 01:07:18.549]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:07:19.270 --> 01:07:26.816]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:07:26.816 --> 01:07:34.822]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:07:34.822 --> 01:07:40.045]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:07:40.045 --> 01:07:42.207]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:07:44.929 --> 01:07:47.531]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:07:47.531 --> 01:07:49.333]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:11.084 --> 01:08:29.298]  Okay, coming up in about 25 minutes, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts joins us on a host of key issues, including his view on what's happening with Dominique Strauss-Kahn, now the disgraced individual who stepped down as the head of the IMF and is still in custody for the alleged rape sodomy.
[01:08:30.899 --> 01:08:40.533]  Then we have Dr. Steve Pucinich joining us to cover a host of issues and Obama's new announcement that Israel must be based on the 1967 borders.
[01:08:40.533 --> 01:08:46.421]  That's just talk to get the new Arab Spring movement
[01:08:47.302 --> 01:08:54.626]  To somehow link up with the globalists and the Al-Qaeda forces they've got that are the head of these movements on record.
[01:08:54.626 --> 01:08:58.669]  Very complex developments on that front.
[01:08:58.669 --> 01:09:05.373]  And we'll get Robert's take on that and also Dr. Pchenik's take on that coming up.
[01:09:05.373 --> 01:09:09.295]  Here's the headline, Obama, Palestinian state must be based on 1967 borders.
[01:09:11.731 --> 01:09:17.956]  Continuing, officials exploit Indy 500 to roll out new federal alert system.
[01:09:17.956 --> 01:09:19.758]  Indiana is one of their big beta test states.
[01:09:19.758 --> 01:09:20.758]  I've always pointed that out.
[01:09:20.758 --> 01:09:27.884]  They were the first that I know of more than 15 years ago, or right around 15 years ago, to have license plate reading cameras up.
[01:09:27.884 --> 01:09:33.448]  That was not classified, but not public information when I discovered it.
[01:09:33.448 --> 01:09:37.652]  I know the folks that have said there's absolutely no Fourth Amendment and it's actually a bad thing.
[01:09:37.652 --> 01:09:40.394]  So you got some real hardcore despots up there.
[01:09:42.307 --> 01:09:46.409]  Okay, good people though in Indiana.
[01:09:46.409 --> 01:09:48.930]  But they definitely have an out-of-control government.
[01:09:48.930 --> 01:09:55.334]  Okay, let me get into the whole birth certificate situation.
[01:09:56.454 --> 01:09:57.515]  I want to be clear.
[01:09:57.515 --> 01:09:59.477]  I shot a special report on this last night.
[01:09:59.477 --> 01:10:00.698]  It'll be up in the next few hours.
[01:10:00.698 --> 01:10:05.683]  10-minute report at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:10:05.683 --> 01:10:14.412]  And I haven't developed the title yet of the special video report, but I'll be able to give that to you by the end of the broadcast coming up here an hour and 50 minutes from now.
[01:10:14.412 --> 01:10:17.535]  But I want to be clear.
[01:10:19.244 --> 01:10:27.189]  I was criticized three years ago when the whole birther controversy began before the media even gave it a name to try to criticize it.
[01:10:27.189 --> 01:10:31.951]  I had Tarpley on who had questions because I respected him and I had Phil Berg on because I respected him.
[01:10:31.951 --> 01:10:34.473]  This is when Obama hadn't even gotten the nomination yet.
[01:10:36.004 --> 01:10:36.325]  I don't know.
[01:10:51.417 --> 01:10:54.419]  My issue is Obama is the guy getting all the Wall Street money.
[01:10:54.419 --> 01:10:56.940]  He says all his advisors are these globalists.
[01:10:56.940 --> 01:10:58.941]  He's going to continue what Bush did.
[01:10:58.941 --> 01:11:02.063]  But it's going to give left cover to it, so the left's going to go to sleep.
[01:11:02.063 --> 01:11:04.984]  He's going to support torture, secret arrests, new wars.
[01:11:04.984 --> 01:11:06.965]  I knew that because of who his advisors were.
[01:11:06.965 --> 01:11:11.968]  I started making the Obama deception when he was president-elect in November.
[01:11:11.968 --> 01:11:14.749]  And it was released about a month after he was in office.
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:20.001]  In March.
[01:11:20.001 --> 01:11:21.782]  He got in in January 22nd.
[01:11:21.782 --> 01:11:23.843]  It was released March 13th.
[01:11:23.843 --> 01:11:30.208]  So a little bit about a month or so, a month and a half after he got in.
[01:11:30.208 --> 01:11:31.909]  And I covered the issues.
[01:11:31.909 --> 01:11:32.830]  I covered the facts.
[01:11:35.130 --> 01:11:42.273]  It's not that I'm ashamed when the media calls me a birther, it's just not accurate to say I'm whole hog committed.
[01:11:42.273 --> 01:11:52.219]  I'm somebody who made two films about Obama, accurately predicted in the first film exactly what he would do with stunning prescience.
[01:11:52.219 --> 01:11:58.702]  But it's not prescience, it's knowing the globalist program and who his advisors are and what the agenda is.
[01:12:00.043 --> 01:12:09.195]  It's like if I'm driving down I-35 and I'm driving through Temple and Waco, I know in 70-80 miles I'm going to hit Georgetown and then Austin.
[01:12:09.195 --> 01:12:11.518]  I'm following what they're doing.
[01:12:11.518 --> 01:12:13.040]  It's really not that hard.
[01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:14.561]  That's what's so frustrating about this.
[01:12:14.561 --> 01:12:16.284]  But to make a long story short,
[01:12:19.616 --> 01:12:30.862]  Three years ago, I thought it was a distraction, but out of hundreds and hundreds of broadcasts we did, I did maybe five or six on it.
[01:12:30.862 --> 01:12:31.923]  And got a lot of criticism.
[01:12:31.923 --> 01:12:32.623]  You've heard the calls.
[01:12:32.623 --> 01:12:34.744]  How dare you not be covering a birth certificate?
[01:12:34.744 --> 01:12:36.225]  How dare you not be?
[01:12:36.225 --> 01:12:38.726]  And I'm just like, look, I think it's suspicious.
[01:12:38.726 --> 01:12:43.729]  Nixon lied, Clinton lied, Bush Senior, read my lips.
[01:12:43.729 --> 01:12:45.090]  I mean, they lie.
[01:12:45.090 --> 01:12:46.891]  Clinton bombed aspirin factories to
[01:12:48.214 --> 01:12:52.198]  Divert people from Monica Lewinsky.
[01:12:52.198 --> 01:12:53.279]  I get it.
[01:12:53.279 --> 01:12:59.326]  But I've got areas I can prove 100% that they're lying.
[01:12:59.326 --> 01:13:00.968]  And so why should I go with this?
[01:13:02.537 --> 01:13:05.758]  But over time, I did more research.
[01:13:05.758 --> 01:13:07.959]  Some of his records came out from Indonesia.
[01:13:07.959 --> 01:13:09.739]  He was Barry Sotero on there.
[01:13:09.739 --> 01:13:12.060]  He was listed by the government as Barry Sotero.
[01:13:12.060 --> 01:13:14.360]  That means he had to give up his citizenship.
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:15.821]  The rest of the records have been blocked.
[01:13:15.821 --> 01:13:19.622]  They're all secretive about his college records and high school records and...
[01:13:21.041 --> 01:13:48.629]  No one remembered him as a child, a little boy in Hawaii, and his mother's got this weird CIA history, and it's not just Barry Sotero, there's this other Indonesian name on records that we do have, and then the White House spent over two million fighting to release records, and one of the biggest issues was they released that receipt of a certificate that anybody can go to the Health Department and get a print-off of, and it's simply saying that the
[01:13:49.807 --> 01:13:57.671]  Bureau of Vital Statistics federally says that there is a filing of a record for a birth certificate for that person.
[01:13:57.671 --> 01:13:59.732]  And the media said, this is the birth certificate.
[01:13:59.732 --> 01:14:01.513]  There is no such thing as a long form.
[01:14:01.513 --> 01:14:03.474]  This is made up.
[01:14:03.474 --> 01:14:04.195]  They're lying.
[01:14:04.195 --> 01:14:05.035]  This is the original.
[01:14:05.035 --> 01:14:08.237]  And everybody said, well, mine's got doctor's signatures on it.
[01:14:08.237 --> 01:14:13.540]  And all these boxes and the weight and the mother and the father and all this stuff, that's not what it is.
[01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:16.201]  And they said, shut up, that's it.
[01:14:16.201 --> 01:14:17.262]  For two years plus.
[01:14:18.561 --> 01:14:21.523]  I thought, well, that's suspicious.
[01:14:21.523 --> 01:14:23.765]  And then, of course, these books coming out.
[01:14:23.765 --> 01:14:32.211]  You've got this big Democratic operative out there saying what people want to hear.
[01:14:32.211 --> 01:14:34.553]  Pro-socialist health care in the past.
[01:14:34.553 --> 01:14:35.734]  Pro-eminent domain.
[01:14:35.734 --> 01:14:36.894]  Big globalist.
[01:14:36.894 --> 01:14:37.855]  Casino owner.
[01:14:37.855 --> 01:14:39.196]  I mean, give me a break, folks.
[01:14:39.196 --> 01:14:40.617]  That's mob.
[01:14:40.617 --> 01:14:41.198]  Donald Trump.
[01:14:42.541 --> 01:14:47.022]  And he's out there running around and brings up this issue.
[01:14:47.022 --> 01:14:53.644]  And then right after he, quote, gets discredited when the fake birth certificate comes out, he then cusses a bunch, knowing that'll discredit him.
[01:14:53.644 --> 01:14:54.764]  He's an actor.
[01:14:54.764 --> 01:14:57.765]  And I came out and pointed that out at the time.
[01:14:57.765 --> 01:15:00.886]  And since then, Monday, he dropped out.
[01:15:00.886 --> 01:15:01.766]  But he is a good actor.
[01:15:01.766 --> 01:15:03.887]  He was almost convincing me he was going to run for a while.
[01:15:03.887 --> 01:15:06.528]  My gut at first said, this is all a publicity stunt.
[01:15:06.528 --> 01:15:09.908]  And it turns out I've always got to go with my gut.
[01:15:09.908 --> 01:15:11.689]  But I've set the table with that background.
[01:15:14.224 --> 01:15:23.946]  I don't know if this is a giant PSYOP, or whether he wasn't born in Hawaii, or his real birth certificate has a different father listed.
[01:15:23.946 --> 01:15:28.187]  And Wayne Madsen was high-level NSA.
[01:15:28.187 --> 01:15:31.288]  Everything he's told me has ended up being true.
[01:15:31.288 --> 01:15:34.808]  And he won't give me his sources.
[01:15:34.808 --> 01:15:36.189]  Well, he's quite a character in person.
[01:15:36.189 --> 01:15:38.769]  I hung out with him a lot when he was here for two days.
[01:15:38.769 --> 01:15:43.250]  He said the word is, he was here and said it the day before the birth certificate came out.
[01:15:44.301 --> 01:15:46.145]  He said, no, he was born in Hawaii.
[01:15:46.145 --> 01:15:49.051]  There's a different father.
[01:15:49.051 --> 01:15:54.562]  And then off air, he said, well, I can't really give the source or give more details because it will give up the source.
[01:15:56.545 --> 01:16:00.206]  And then a day later, they released the birth certificate.
[01:16:00.206 --> 01:16:02.766]  And Madsen predicted they would do that as well.
[01:16:02.766 --> 01:16:05.587]  And now Corsi's saying he was told three weeks before that they were.
[01:16:05.587 --> 01:16:09.928]  I had sources saying they were getting ready to very high level in D.C.
[01:16:09.928 --> 01:16:10.548]  and Chicago.
[01:16:10.548 --> 01:16:14.829]  We even had callers saying the same thing with their media sources in Chicago who were in media.
[01:16:14.829 --> 01:16:16.649]  Because these folks talk.
[01:16:16.649 --> 01:16:18.730]  People say, well, something this big, it would come out.
[01:16:18.730 --> 01:16:19.390]  It does come out.
[01:16:20.592 --> 01:16:28.382]  Just like ships came back at the Gulf of Tonkin and said it was staged, it was in the San Diego newspaper, but then people forgot where they read it and it became an urban legend.
[01:16:28.382 --> 01:16:29.764]  It wasn't an urban legend.
[01:16:29.764 --> 01:16:32.908]  Generally legends have some truth to them.
[01:16:32.908 --> 01:16:33.750]  But continuing here...
[01:16:35.945 --> 01:16:58.652]  Either they're putting this all out to make it a diversion and make the election about his eligibility because they know he really was born in America and they think this is something to hype up because then people don't look at the torture, the wars, the lobbyists, the banker insiders, the Patriot Act, all the things Democrats said they hated.
[01:16:58.652 --> 01:17:03.614]  Well, if you hate what Obama's doing, then you hated Bush, but if you hated Bush,
[01:17:04.631 --> 01:17:08.834]  on his policies, and you're a Democrat, you should hate Obama.
[01:17:08.834 --> 01:17:19.562]  But if you love Bush, you should love Obama if you're a mainline Republican, because rhetoric's different, but the actions are identical in the real world.
[01:17:19.562 --> 01:17:28.329]  So either it's a psy-op to make this about this non-issue, and there's some evidence towards that that came out from the White House yesterday,
[01:17:30.067 --> 01:17:40.191]  Or they are hiding something in his past and with the Indonesia stuff and the records being covered up and his CIA background, I don't know.
[01:17:40.191 --> 01:17:46.053]  But it's important and we're covering it because the system is pushing it out there for a reason.
[01:17:47.116 --> 01:17:48.677]  And so we have to analyze it.
[01:17:48.677 --> 01:17:56.941]  You know, we didn't just spend two, three weeks on bin Laden just because we knew that was a fake operation.
[01:17:56.941 --> 01:18:00.622]  It's everything connected to why did they bring that out now domestically?
[01:18:00.622 --> 01:18:02.123]  Well, it's for the reelection campaign.
[01:18:02.123 --> 01:18:04.304]  He's going to run on killing bin Laden.
[01:18:04.304 --> 01:18:06.405]  But it's also about hyping up new terror attacks.
[01:18:06.405 --> 01:18:08.086]  And it's about framing Pakistan.
[01:18:08.923 --> 01:18:11.264]  And having a pretext to occupy that country.
[01:18:11.264 --> 01:18:15.484]  So see, there's reasons they roll these things out.
[01:18:15.484 --> 01:18:18.985]  It's what they matrix in and connect to it.
[01:18:18.985 --> 01:18:20.766]  What are the spokes coming off from this?
[01:18:20.766 --> 01:18:30.127]  It's why, even though it's a propaganda event, within the propaganda event is the riddle to understand the plan and the next phase.
[01:18:30.127 --> 01:18:32.348]  So you have to study these very carefully.
[01:18:33.669 --> 01:18:36.791]  Now, it blew over a few weeks ago.
[01:18:36.791 --> 01:18:43.494]  A lot of polls showed people still don't believe he was born here, don't believe a word he says, because government's been caught lying so much in the past.
[01:18:43.494 --> 01:18:52.038]  I mean, if Nixon called Woodward and Bernstein in at the start of Watergate and said, boys, I didn't have people break into that hotel, and they said, that's good enough for us, Mr. President.
[01:18:53.772 --> 01:18:55.073]  No, I mean, that's ridiculous.
[01:18:55.073 --> 01:19:00.077]  You don't just buy, and presidents were more trusted back in the 70s than they are now.
[01:19:00.077 --> 01:19:04.060]  Since when do we just, oh, you say, there's WMDs in Iraq.
[01:19:04.060 --> 01:19:05.742]  It turns out they lied premeditatedly.
[01:19:05.742 --> 01:19:08.604]  Oh, you say, you were born in Hawaii.
[01:19:08.604 --> 01:19:12.367]  You say, you know, all of these things.
[01:19:12.367 --> 01:19:14.909]  They lie, lie, lie, lie, lie.
[01:19:14.909 --> 01:19:16.890]  I mean, think of all the lies.
[01:19:16.890 --> 01:19:18.151]  Read my lips, no new taxes.
[01:19:18.151 --> 01:19:20.393]  I didn't have sex with that woman, Monica Lewinsky.
[01:19:20.393 --> 01:19:21.094]  They're legion.
[01:19:23.325 --> 01:19:25.172]  Now, something big happened.
[01:19:25.172 --> 01:19:27.239]  Multiple things happened yesterday.
[01:19:27.239 --> 01:19:29.306]  We're going to cover it when we come back.
[01:19:29.306 --> 01:19:29.708]  Because...
[01:19:33.166 --> 01:19:36.047]  Esquire will lose a lawsuit.
[01:19:36.047 --> 01:19:39.309]  I mean, there's no doubt that WorldNetDaily gets the right lawyer.
[01:19:39.309 --> 01:19:42.310]  This is economic espionage 101.
[01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:45.431]  Definitely is going to damage WorldNetDaily as publishers.
[01:19:45.431 --> 01:19:50.153]  It's definitely a hoax meant to damage the book.
[01:19:50.153 --> 01:19:51.474]  And we're going to cover it when we come back.
[01:19:51.474 --> 01:19:54.495]  And it shows total desperation.
[01:19:54.495 --> 01:19:56.716]  And Esquire is a White House mouthpiece.
[01:19:56.716 --> 01:19:57.116]  Stay with us.
[01:19:57.116 --> 01:19:58.337]  We're going to break this down on the other side.
[01:20:00.606 --> 01:20:00.846]  I think?
[01:20:15.626 --> 01:20:20.750]  For your body to make optimal levels of glutathione, it needs an abundance of the amino acid cysteine.
[01:20:20.750 --> 01:20:27.015]  The highest dietary source of cysteine is non-denatured whey protein powder from grass-fed cows.
[01:20:27.015 --> 01:20:31.498]  The most non-denatured whey protein powder on the market is One World Whey.
[01:20:31.498 --> 01:20:35.121]  One World Whey is an industry first with its True Cool process.
[01:20:35.121 --> 01:20:38.524]  It retains all the active components of fresh raw whey.
[01:20:38.524 --> 01:20:45.309]  One World Whey is rich in immune, bodybuilding, and detoxification factors that make it a life-giving power food for everyone.
[01:20:45.589 --> 01:20:50.234]  One World Whey is sweetened with cold processed stevia and comes in three delicious flavors.
[01:20:50.234 --> 01:20:54.138]  To hear some impressive testimonies, go to OneWorldWhey.com.
[01:20:54.138 --> 01:20:57.181]  That's OneWorldWhey.com.

[01:21:35.839 --> 01:21:41.643]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.

[01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:05.700]  The U.S.
[01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:12.986]  government is a Ponzi scheme that relies on the Treasury continuously selling large amounts of government bonds to foreign central banks.
[01:22:12.986 --> 01:22:15.689]  With Japan about to become a seller of U.S.
[01:22:15.689 --> 01:22:17.891]  bonds in order to rebuild its own nation,
[01:22:18.291 --> 01:22:18.752]  We're good to go.

[01:24:17.294 --> 01:24:18.854]  Escape from the Prison Planet!
[01:24:18.854 --> 01:24:21.935]  Again, thank you for joining us.
[01:24:21.935 --> 01:24:26.157]  Okay, finishing up with this new big controversy.
[01:24:26.157 --> 01:24:28.857]  We got Dr. Corsi on tomorrow.
[01:24:28.857 --> 01:24:33.319]  Breaking Esquire reported, Jerome Corsi's birther book pulled from the shelves.
[01:24:34.219 --> 01:24:57.904]  One day after the release of the birth certificate, the case that Barack Obama is not eligible to be President by Dr. Jerome Corsi, WorldNet Daily Editor-in-Chief Executive Officer Joseph Farah has announced plans to recall and pulp the entire 200,000 first printing run of the book, as well as announcing an offer to refund the purchase price to anyone who has already bought either a hard copy or electronic download of the book.
[01:24:58.604 --> 01:25:03.768]  Now that's meant to just flood them through their merchant services and bank accounts.
[01:25:03.768 --> 01:25:08.812]  With that, people will then think it's been offered and get mad when it's not offered.
[01:25:08.812 --> 01:25:11.714]  Stores will get calls and walk-ins.
[01:25:11.714 --> 01:25:13.736]  They will then pull it from the store shelves.
[01:25:13.736 --> 01:25:15.177]  It's just totally criminal.
[01:25:16.401 --> 01:25:23.505]  And this was not written in a satire section, it was written in politics news section by Mark Warren.
[01:25:23.505 --> 01:25:26.186]  Just unbelievably vicious.
[01:25:26.186 --> 01:25:30.488]  And again, they do hit pieces for the White House, but this is a desperation move.
[01:25:30.488 --> 01:25:30.768]  Why?
[01:25:30.768 --> 01:25:33.869]  If he's born in Hawaii, this is a real birth certificate, why worry?
[01:25:33.869 --> 01:25:35.810]  Because I don't know where he was born!
[01:25:35.810 --> 01:25:37.271]  I don't want to talk about it!
[01:25:37.271 --> 01:25:38.772]  But when he puts a fake out,
[01:25:39.755 --> 01:25:43.598]  And it's just been, oh my gosh, the whole thing is fake.
[01:25:43.598 --> 01:25:55.468]  I've gone over it, we've got a video coming out, a few hours breaking it down, the kerning, the computer changing it, the typewriter letters being identical.
[01:25:55.468 --> 01:25:58.370]  A typewriter strikes the...
[01:26:00.237 --> 01:26:15.823]  Ribbon and everyone is different even if it's the same E or A or Z It's like a snowflake or a fingerprint the way it strikes the way the ink blobs around the edge when the metal strikes the ribbon Anybody who's had a typewriter knows that but you blow it up.
[01:26:15.823 --> 01:26:22.246]  They're identical this was done with a computer with I mean it was done to be fake to be discovered and
[01:26:24.239 --> 01:26:33.703]  Or they're just so desperate and they didn't want to have an agency do it because they thought folks might blackmail the White House with it, and it might get leaked that they used somebody down the hall.
[01:26:33.703 --> 01:26:34.283]  I don't know!
[01:26:34.283 --> 01:26:35.764]  The point is, it's fake!
[01:26:35.764 --> 01:26:36.464]  It's fake!
[01:26:36.464 --> 01:26:37.245]  It's fake!
[01:26:37.245 --> 01:26:38.465]  There's no doubt!
[01:26:38.465 --> 01:26:40.866]  This is so crazy!
[01:26:40.866 --> 01:26:49.570]  And so they had this article and it goes out and says, in an exclusive interview, a reflective pharaoh who wrote the books forward, I mean, they say they interviewed him.
[01:26:51.806 --> 01:27:02.950]  I reflect to Farah who wrote the books Forward and also published Corsi's earlier best-selling work, Unfit for Command, Swift Boat Veterans, speaking out against John Kerry.
[01:27:02.950 --> 01:27:10.873]  And it goes on, I believe with all my heart that Barack Obama is destroying this country and I will continue to stand against his administration at every turn.
[01:27:10.873 --> 01:27:16.775]  But in light of recent events, this book has become problematic and contains what I now believe to be factual inaccuracies.
[01:27:16.775 --> 01:27:20.957]  He's speaking for him, saying he interviewed him, a journalist in a prestigious magazine.
[01:27:22.096 --> 01:27:27.538]  He said this morning, I cannot in good conscience publish it and expect anyone to believe it.
[01:27:27.538 --> 01:27:31.599]  So that's like saying Alex Jones admitted he committed murder.
[01:27:31.599 --> 01:27:34.440]  Alex Jones admits he lied all these years.
[01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:39.281]  Imagine if Esquire put out an article and said we interviewed Alex Jones.
[01:27:39.281 --> 01:27:41.202]  He admits he injects heroin.
[01:27:41.202 --> 01:27:43.642]  He admits he's lied all these years.
[01:27:43.642 --> 01:27:44.503]  He admits he
[01:27:46.363 --> 01:27:47.824]  Tortures little dogs.
[01:27:47.824 --> 01:28:00.314]  I mean, they are saying, they interviewed the publisher who's printed hundreds of thousands of these, millions in investment, this could destroy them, and they say it's being pulled, they want to refund your money, we talked to him.
[01:28:00.314 --> 01:28:01.075]  And it goes on.
[01:28:01.075 --> 01:28:05.499]  I mean, Esquire did this, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:05.499 --> 01:28:12.925]  And then hours and hours later after National News picked it up, then they add that it's satire at the bottom, not even at the top.
[01:28:13.959 --> 01:28:15.900]  Now, here's the World Net Daily article.
[01:28:15.900 --> 01:28:19.200]  National Mag Publishes Fabricated Report Attacking Courtesy Book.
[01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:23.261]  Esquire Claims Best Seller Being Disavowed By Publisher Pulled From Shelves.
[01:28:23.261 --> 01:28:25.442]  Just unbelievable economic sabotage.
[01:28:25.442 --> 01:28:27.623]  I mean, that is espionage.
[01:28:27.623 --> 01:28:29.363]  Or economic sabotage.
[01:28:29.363 --> 01:28:33.244]  That's what espionage is, boys and girls.
[01:28:33.244 --> 01:28:36.205]  Now, continuing, what else came out yesterday?
[01:28:36.205 --> 01:28:38.985]  ABC News talking to the White House.
[01:28:38.985 --> 01:28:40.446]  They're going to sell
[01:28:41.744 --> 01:28:50.672]  Made in America t-shirts running on the fact that the birthers are discredited.
[01:28:50.672 --> 01:29:01.823]  So instead of running on the fact that Obama's lied about everything and is incredibly corrupt and that the economy's falling apart, instead they're going to run ABC News reports on this.
[01:29:01.823 --> 01:29:06.788]  So because they're going to run on it, they've got to continue to attack the fact that it's a fake birth certificate.
[01:29:07.574 --> 01:29:17.790]  Part of the reason for the shirts, a campaign official told ABC News, is the, uh, despite the president's release last month of the long form birth certificate, I thought there wasn't one of those in existence.
[01:29:17.790 --> 01:29:19.052]  They didn't exist, remember?
[01:29:19.052 --> 01:29:22.136]  See the previous lies, like we're idiots and don't know there's a long form?
[01:29:23.376 --> 01:29:28.261]  Conservative fact-checking author Jerome Corsi's book, Where's the Birth Certificate?
[01:29:28.261 --> 01:29:32.384]  The case that Barack Obama is not eligible to be president was published last week.
[01:29:32.384 --> 01:29:39.011]  And it goes on to say the White House is basically going to run on the birth certificate issue.
[01:29:39.011 --> 01:29:43.195]  And so they've come out with an announcement saying that
[01:29:44.861 --> 01:29:49.047]  Corsi and Farah have pled guilty to being, you know, frauds when they didn't.
[01:29:49.047 --> 01:29:50.269]  And Obama's the fraud.
[01:29:50.269 --> 01:29:51.030]  The birth certificate's the fraud.
[01:29:51.030 --> 01:29:52.312]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.312 --> 01:29:54.836]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.836 --> 01:29:57.520]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.564 --> 01:30:17.041]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:30:17.041 --> 01:30:20.725]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:21.724 --> 01:30:34.495]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:30:34.495 --> 01:30:41.760]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:30:42.441 --> 01:30:52.814]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.

[01:31:00.484 --> 01:31:05.028]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:31:05.028 --> 01:31:05.949]  Number 1.
[01:31:05.949 --> 01:31:09.372]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:09.372 --> 01:31:10.232]  Number 2.
[01:31:10.232 --> 01:31:15.136]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:31:15.136 --> 01:31:15.877]  It's true.
[01:31:15.877 --> 01:31:20.741]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:20.741 --> 01:31:21.582]  Number 3.
[01:31:21.582 --> 01:31:25.165]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:31:25.165 --> 01:31:28.868]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:29.048 --> 01:31:29.849]  Number 4.
[01:31:29.849 --> 01:31:32.612]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:31:32.612 --> 01:31:36.296]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:31:36.296 --> 01:31:37.096]  Number 5.
[01:31:37.096 --> 01:31:41.241]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:31:41.241 --> 01:31:46.006]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:31:46.286 --> 01:31:50.451]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:32:13.431 --> 01:32:19.173]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[01:32:19.173 --> 01:32:22.454]  Not worried about them moving south.
[01:32:22.454 --> 01:32:26.335]  Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[01:32:28.943 --> 01:32:34.587]  I'm looking for America.
[01:32:34.587 --> 01:32:36.108]  Wear American and be proud.
[01:32:36.108 --> 01:32:38.730]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[01:32:38.730 --> 01:32:43.234]  The land I left free and the home of the brave.
[01:32:43.234 --> 01:32:47.477]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[01:32:54.921 --> 01:32:59.487]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[01:33:24.312 --> 01:33:36.141]  All right, we're going to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, syndicated columnist, former Wall Street Journal editor, and of course, former head of policy department of Treasury under Reagan, here in a moment, just briefly finishing up with a birth certificate.
[01:33:36.141 --> 01:33:38.943]  I've not been a birther in the three years this has been out.
[01:33:38.943 --> 01:33:43.266]  I have interviewed some guests, I've looked at it, they're definitely covering up Obama's past.
[01:33:43.266 --> 01:33:47.729]  His mother's definitely CIA and above, with the big foundations.
[01:33:47.729 --> 01:33:49.750]  He definitely had the name Barry Sotero.
[01:33:49.750 --> 01:33:50.251]  It's weird.
[01:33:51.175 --> 01:33:57.177]  But the fact that they did release this new one, and it's been analyzed, and it's clearly been shown to be fake, is amazing.
[01:33:57.177 --> 01:34:05.359]  And Dr. Jerome Corsi is on tomorrow, and we've got that report up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:34:05.359 --> 01:34:13.102]  Bertha Bombshell, Corsi to release evidence proving Obama's certificate as fraudulent, a fraudulent composite.
[01:34:13.102 --> 01:34:20.624]  We've got a video in the next few hours going up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, a 10-minute report detailing the full spectrum
[01:34:22.143 --> 01:34:28.869]  Of this information and Joseph Farah saying he's gonna have to sue Esquire now because it wasn't a parody.
[01:34:28.869 --> 01:34:30.030]  They didn't say it was a parody.
[01:34:30.030 --> 01:34:31.711]  They didn't add it was satire.
[01:34:31.711 --> 01:34:36.636]  They came out in a serious report and said they interviewed Farah and he was recalling the book and giving people's money back.
[01:34:37.316 --> 01:34:40.999]  Which is economic espionage and a serious, serious attack.
[01:34:40.999 --> 01:34:51.326]  Which shows they're desperate and ABC News reports the White House is now planning to run on the birth certificate issue and putting out campaign t-shirts to be sold to raise money.
[01:34:51.326 --> 01:34:54.608]  So this issue is not going away.
[01:34:54.608 --> 01:34:56.890]  I wish it would because I want to look at the issues with Obama.
[01:34:57.210 --> 01:35:01.413]  He might have been born on Mars for all I care.
[01:35:01.413 --> 01:35:05.455]  At the end of the day, this guy's continuing the neocon agenda.
[01:35:05.455 --> 01:35:16.383]  We'll also get Dr. Paul Craig Roberts' take on Obama coming out and pushing all these revolutions and saying Israel needs to go back to its 67 borders.
[01:35:16.383 --> 01:35:17.563]  Ron Paul's out saying
[01:35:19.059 --> 01:35:19.259]  That's
[01:35:41.149 --> 01:35:54.917]  Strauss-Kahn situation and in national polls in France fully 60% or higher the lowest poll 60% believe this is a setup.
[01:35:54.917 --> 01:36:03.442]  Kahn was set in polls to handily defeat and was going to be running as the leader of the Socialist Party against Nicolas Sarkozy.
[01:36:04.267 --> 01:36:04.588]  I don't
[01:36:20.044 --> 01:36:25.606]  Bill Clinton, Juanita Broderick, all of it, but then magically this happens.
[01:36:25.606 --> 01:36:32.868]  So the whole thing is suspicious, and Paul Craig Roberts has an article, the Strauss-Kahn frame-up, the American police state strides forward.
[01:36:32.868 --> 01:36:38.530]  So we'll cover that first, then get his take on the whole OBL hoax.
[01:36:38.530 --> 01:36:43.972]  He very eloquently a few weeks ago with Paul Watson broke down some of the glaring issues.
[01:36:43.972 --> 01:36:46.093]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, thank you for joining us today.
[01:36:46.872 --> 01:36:48.212]  Hello, Alex.
[01:36:48.212 --> 01:36:49.333]  Good to have you with us.
[01:36:49.333 --> 01:36:51.914]  Let's get into the Dominique Strauss con.
[01:36:51.914 --> 01:36:57.836]  You seem pretty convinced here that there's some dirty shenanigans going on.
[01:36:57.836 --> 01:36:58.556]  Well, I do.
[01:36:58.556 --> 01:37:11.661]  I am, because from the very beginning, the police, instead of doing as they are required to do and give a defendant the presumption of innocence, immediately began painting a picture of a guilty man.
[01:37:12.583 --> 01:37:23.552]  So from the very first announcement, the police have been trying to paint his guilt all over him, and it continues that way.
[01:37:23.552 --> 01:37:32.879]  And so when you see that, it's pretty much a giveaway that they intend to convict him.
[01:37:32.879 --> 01:37:37.903]  And there's too many things wrong with the story.
[01:37:39.153 --> 01:37:43.938]  Uh, and, uh, one of the most astounding things is that the way they found him.
[01:37:45.705 --> 01:37:51.910]  Is that when he got to the airport, he realized he had left a cell phone and called the hotel.
[01:37:51.910 --> 01:38:00.817]  He said, I'm at John F. Kennedy Airport, and I think I've left my cell phone, and would you see if you can retrieve it?
[01:38:00.817 --> 01:38:11.645]  Now, that doesn't go with the picture that the police put out of a rapist fleeing his crime and heading out of the country.
[01:38:12.606 --> 01:38:15.827]  And that was also the reason he was denied bail.
[01:38:15.827 --> 01:38:22.608]  The judge said, oh, he was fleeing the scene and had run on a plane and we caught him just in the nick of time.
[01:38:22.608 --> 01:38:24.709]  Well, they didn't catch him.
[01:38:24.709 --> 01:38:26.469]  He called in and reported where he was.
[01:38:26.469 --> 01:38:37.431]  So it doesn't really make much sense that if you were fleeing from a crime scene that you would then call the scene of the crime and tell them where you are.
[01:38:37.431 --> 01:38:40.692]  So there are just so many things about it.
[01:38:41.292 --> 01:38:57.638]  Now, we do know that he was expected to be able to defeat Nicolas Sarkozy for the presidency of France in this upcoming election, and that Sarkozy is America's guy.
[01:38:57.638 --> 01:38:58.458]  We put him in there.
[01:38:58.458 --> 01:39:00.479]  It was American money and influence.
[01:39:03.827 --> 01:39:21.082]  Another black mark against Strauss-Kahn is that he let the IMF issue a report recently that said that within five years, China would have surpassed the United States as the world's leading economic power.
[01:39:21.082 --> 01:39:29.349]  Now this hurts Washington's prestige and hurts its ability to bully people.
[01:39:29.349 --> 01:39:31.511]  People say, well, if we can hold out long enough,
[01:39:33.031 --> 01:39:36.613]  They'll lose some of their power.
[01:39:36.613 --> 01:39:41.415]  And so this also is a mark against him.
[01:39:41.415 --> 01:39:51.259]  And I think a third mark is that he had scared the bankers because he speaks of the need to re-regulate the banking system, which is run amok.
[01:39:52.379 --> 01:40:07.217]  And he has also indicated that he was sympathetic with Joseph Stiglitz's view that the IMF should cease to be a weapon that the rich use against the poor.
[01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:21.725]  And that the kind of austerity programs that are imposed on poor people, as in Greece today, Ireland today, in order to bail out Wall Street, that just really doesn't fly.
[01:40:21.725 --> 01:40:31.568]  And so, he had a whole number then of powerful enemies and had predicted, prior to his departure,
[01:40:32.580 --> 01:40:33.621]  for the United States.
[01:40:49.669 --> 01:40:54.733]  Smear in order to Reduce his standing in the polls.
[01:40:54.733 --> 01:40:55.173]  Yes, sir.
[01:40:55.173 --> 01:41:08.362]  Let me add a caveat there I have BBC Daily Mail all the big French papers He was on record saying they could set me up in a car park claiming I raped a woman But but that's not even the big key.
[01:41:08.362 --> 01:41:13.486]  I want you to speak to that and then this they admit that a campaign staffer
[01:41:14.691 --> 01:41:14.791]  Yes.
[01:41:14.791 --> 01:41:14.871]  Yes.
[01:41:35.043 --> 01:41:35.603]  Right.
[01:41:35.603 --> 01:41:45.188]  Admits, for Sarkozy, the big national Karl Rove over there, the equivalent of Karl Rove admits, that he put this out before it was even known.
[01:41:45.188 --> 01:41:55.053]  So whether he did it or not, or maybe she enticed or who knows, this is all red-handed that this was an intelligence operation.
[01:41:55.053 --> 01:41:56.834]  Yes, I think that you're right.
[01:41:56.834 --> 01:41:59.095]  I cited that report from the
[01:42:00.411 --> 01:42:04.234]  Daily Mail and from Liberation in my column.
[01:42:04.234 --> 01:42:10.700]  And it is clear that that is admitted.
[01:42:10.700 --> 01:42:22.589]  Somehow, the operative for Sarkozy against Strauss-Kahn knew before the New York police made the announcement.
[01:42:22.589 --> 01:42:27.293]  So that, of course, is more giveaway.
[01:42:28.715 --> 01:42:31.500]  I think you'll have a hard time getting out of it because...
[01:42:34.524 --> 01:42:41.266]  If you look around, the left wing will want to get him because he's a rich white guy.
[01:42:41.266 --> 01:42:49.008]  And the feminists will want to get him because they know that all men are always raping women.
[01:42:49.008 --> 01:42:55.490]  There are just so many people that getting him is emotional satisfaction.
[01:42:55.490 --> 01:42:59.991]  It goes along with their agendas and emotional needs.
[01:42:59.991 --> 01:43:01.032]  He's going to have a hard time.
[01:43:01.932 --> 01:43:13.195]  And it's quite clear, too, to add to your point, Alex, that if he was actually serving the system, they wouldn't touch him.
[01:43:13.195 --> 01:43:20.836]  He would actually be able to rape somebody in broad daylight and get away with it, in front of witnesses.
[01:43:20.836 --> 01:43:28.018]  So, clearly, he was seen as a threat, just like Eliot Spitzer.
[01:43:28.886 --> 01:43:35.070]  And the fact that such a powerful figure was destroyed indicates that he was seen as a threat, not as a servant of the system.
[01:43:55.100 --> 01:43:58.982]  Definitely shows that there's a rift between the IMF and World Bank.
[01:43:58.982 --> 01:44:03.705]  Definitely illustrates that there is a fight going on right now.
[01:44:03.705 --> 01:44:10.668]  And we saw Merkel last year call the big private banks like JPMorgan and others, you know, crooks.
[01:44:10.668 --> 01:44:12.149]  They're trying to implode Europe.
[01:44:12.149 --> 01:44:13.630]  They're trying to implode the United States.
[01:44:13.630 --> 01:44:15.871]  They're completely predatory.
[01:44:15.871 --> 01:44:18.233]  I don't think at the end of the day, Dominic Strauss-Kahn
[01:44:19.213 --> 01:44:19.793]  Well, that's it.
[01:44:19.793 --> 01:44:22.415]  Of course, there's no doubt that the man is Randy.
[01:44:40.934 --> 01:44:46.077]  And likes the companionship of women.
[01:44:46.077 --> 01:44:50.199]  And that, of course, is also being used against him.
[01:44:50.199 --> 01:45:04.528]  And I think that, you know, even among the Soviet Communist Party, a social conscience developed among some members, leading to reforms and collapse.
[01:45:05.666 --> 01:45:15.613]  And so I wouldn't be surprised that there are people in the IMF who've had enough of squeezing and trampling the poor.
[01:45:15.613 --> 01:45:21.637]  At some point, some people are affected by that and reform themselves.
[01:45:21.637 --> 01:45:28.161]  And there is perhaps a struggle going on in the IMF, but I suspect that's now over.
[01:45:28.161 --> 01:45:32.584]  Because what this, it's not just the arrest, it's the way he is
[01:45:35.660 --> 01:45:39.001]  are pronounced to be guilty before any evidence is in.
[01:45:39.001 --> 01:45:41.521]  I mean, no one's seen the maid.
[01:45:41.521 --> 01:45:43.902]  We assume she exists.
[01:45:43.902 --> 01:45:53.103]  And who else wants to take on that role and be faced with similar treatment?
[01:45:53.103 --> 01:46:02.345]  So it's, it's a huge warning shot to reformers to shut up and get back in line or you'll be next.
[01:46:05.367 --> 01:46:20.431]  Expanding on that, it certainly sends a message across the board, and we dovetail it with the Indiana Supreme Court ruling last week, and I read the judge's statement in the winning ruling.
[01:46:22.074 --> 01:46:27.738]  Saying police can now enter your home for any reason, including no reason at all.
[01:46:27.738 --> 01:46:29.459]  That's a quote.
[01:46:29.459 --> 01:46:30.439]  And the U.S.
[01:46:30.439 --> 01:46:32.441]  Supreme Court said they can listen at your door.
[01:46:32.441 --> 01:46:38.985]  Do they hear sounds that could be hiding drugs, ruffling or any sounds at all, they can come in without warrants.
[01:46:38.985 --> 01:46:46.710]  And they're now announcing, yes, we're going to continue to expand sneak and peaks and non-terror related.
[01:46:46.710 --> 01:46:50.012]  And that now even local jurisdictions are using it outside of the feds.
[01:46:50.832 --> 01:46:53.933]  I mean, it's just a complete abolition of everything.
[01:46:53.933 --> 01:47:03.096]  And you see, whether Khan is guilty or innocent, if he's not given due process, he has to be set free.
[01:47:03.096 --> 01:47:07.477]  Better ten guilty men go free than one innocent man go to prison.
[01:47:07.477 --> 01:47:10.478]  That's always been the maximum of liberty and common sense.
[01:47:10.478 --> 01:47:11.279]  And there is a war.
[01:47:12.739 --> 01:47:13.779]  A conscious war.
[01:47:13.779 --> 01:47:19.702]  I have an Indiana sheriff saying we're now going to do door-to-door gun searches of homes.
[01:47:19.702 --> 01:47:21.863]  We no longer need warrants.
[01:47:21.863 --> 01:47:30.627]  They're announcing their avarice-filled, tyrant-filled desire to run wild over us, Dr. Roberts.
[01:47:31.721 --> 01:47:33.141]  Yes, the Fourth Amendment's gone.
[01:47:33.141 --> 01:47:44.345]  In fact, you know, look, Alex, this is the subject of my book, The Territory of Good Intentions, that went through two editions and a number of printings, that we've lost the protection of law.
[01:47:44.345 --> 01:47:49.287]  The constitutional amendments that comprise the Bill of Rights are simply eroded.
[01:47:51.142 --> 01:48:04.118]  I'm sure you're aware of the recent reports from Tennessee television stations about the police in Tennessee stopping traffic on I-40 and taking everybody's money.
[01:48:04.986 --> 01:48:11.530]  On the grounds that if you have cash, it's an indication that you just sold drugs and that's drug money.
[01:48:11.530 --> 01:48:25.140]  And the reports are that the various police jurisdictions are almost coming to blows between themselves over who gets to disrupt this traffic and take the money.
[01:48:25.140 --> 01:48:29.963]  And one of the small jurisdictions has already seized $1 million from motorists.
[01:48:31.784 --> 01:48:38.268]  And they go out there and just have blanket traffic stops and go through people's wallets to take their money.
[01:48:38.268 --> 01:48:40.109]  This is happening right now.
[01:48:40.109 --> 01:48:47.913]  And I can remember in my book, I tell the case of when this was happening in Florida a number of years ago.
[01:48:47.913 --> 01:48:56.437]  So you're right, there's really no restrictions any longer on police, what they do.
[01:48:56.437 --> 01:48:58.278]  They're unaccountable.
[01:48:58.278 --> 01:49:01.100]  And there's no real inclination to hold them accountable.
[01:49:03.286 --> 01:49:11.371]  The conservative war on crime has unleashed police and created a monster.
[01:49:11.371 --> 01:49:20.777]  And it's very interesting that the Supreme Court, by an 8-1 vote, gave even more power to the police, powers that you just described.
[01:49:22.437 --> 01:49:32.450]  Because they can say, oh we heard somebody flushing the toilet so that meant the drugs were going down the toilet so we had the right to bust in.
[01:49:32.450 --> 01:49:39.058]  So there's no longer any constraints and people just seem to be at ease with this.
[01:49:39.058 --> 01:49:39.979]  They don't seem to be.
[01:49:40.680 --> 01:49:42.822]  And now they're announcing the austerity.
[01:49:42.822 --> 01:49:48.706]  In Europe, they're going after private pension funds, 100% your money.
[01:49:48.706 --> 01:49:57.432]  They're now telling us to get rid of and cut the public pension funds here, but don't stop any of the banker bailouts or corporate welfare.
[01:49:57.432 --> 01:49:59.093]  We're going into austerity.
[01:49:59.093 --> 01:50:07.679]  The ruling class knows they've committed all these crimes and they've decided to protect themselves and continue on by consciously setting up a police state.
[01:50:07.679 --> 01:50:09.000]  How do we counter this?
[01:50:10.248 --> 01:50:14.992]  I don't really know, Alex.
[01:50:14.992 --> 01:50:17.154]  But you're certainly right, that's what's happening.
[01:50:17.154 --> 01:50:22.698]  Look, can you remember a decade or two back, the junk bond king, Michael Milken?
[01:50:22.698 --> 01:50:24.079]  Yeah.
[01:50:24.079 --> 01:50:25.801]  Well, he had done absolutely nothing.
[01:50:26.786 --> 01:50:30.787]  Though everyone thinks he was convicted of insider trading.
[01:50:30.787 --> 01:50:31.447]  That's false.
[01:50:31.447 --> 01:50:33.568]  That was a rumor that Julia Honey put out.
[01:50:33.568 --> 01:50:34.909]  Stay there, stay there Dr. Roberts.
[01:50:34.909 --> 01:50:37.029]  We're going to come right back and finish that story.
[01:50:37.029 --> 01:50:40.910]  Get a brief update on the latest Bin Laden fables.
[01:50:40.910 --> 01:50:45.172]  I've now admitted just the whole story's fake up one side and down the other.
[01:50:45.172 --> 01:50:45.972]  But so what?
[01:50:45.972 --> 01:50:51.954]  From the grave, he says he agrees with the revolutions of the Middle East that are U.S.
[01:50:51.954 --> 01:50:52.234]  funded.
[01:50:53.749 --> 01:50:54.169]  Amazing.
[01:50:54.169 --> 01:50:56.211]  We'll be right back with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[01:50:56.211 --> 01:51:01.175]  Stay with us.
[01:51:01.175 --> 01:51:03.957]  Will I have garlic breath after I take Ali-C?
[01:51:04.537 --> 01:51:17.731]  We get that question all the time about the world's best garlic extract, Alley C. And the answer is, Alley C contains stabilized allicin, nature's antimicrobial agent, and the active ingredient in crushed garlic, but will not give you garlic breath.
[01:51:17.731 --> 01:51:24.718]  Scientifically proven in double-blind studies, using low doses of allicin greatly reduces the number, severity, and duration of common colds.
[01:51:24.978 --> 01:51:29.123]  Our powerful Ali-C contains 300 milligrams of stabilized allicin.
[01:51:29.123 --> 01:51:33.228]  Just one tablet of Ali-C is equivalent to 40 garlic cloves.
[01:51:33.228 --> 01:51:40.116]  It's effective against asthma, MRSA, bacterial fungal, and viral infections, and helps lower high blood pressure and high cholesterol.
[01:51:40.116 --> 01:51:42.218]  Plus, it's a natural mosquito repellent.
[01:51:42.218 --> 01:51:45.142]  Boosts resistance to infection with nature's best garlic extract.
[01:51:45.462 --> 01:51:50.627]  Ali C. For more information and to order Ali C., call 877-888-7126 or go to GarlicHealthProducts.com.
[01:51:50.627 --> 01:51:52.728]  That's 877-888-7126 or GarlicHealthProducts.com.
[01:51:52.728 --> 01:51:53.529]  Fight back with Ali C.
[01:52:00.555 --> 01:52:01.875]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:01.875 --> 01:52:07.457]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:07.457 --> 01:52:12.478]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:12.478 --> 01:52:18.039]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:52:18.039 --> 01:52:22.720]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:23.260 --> 01:52:30.384]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:52:30.384 --> 01:52:31.504]  And here's the best part.
[01:52:31.504 --> 01:52:38.188]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:52:38.188 --> 01:52:41.389]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:41.389 --> 01:52:44.491]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:52:44.491 --> 01:52:44.711]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:52:52.395 --> 01:52:57.236]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:57.236 --> 01:53:00.177]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:53:00.177 --> 01:53:09.160]  Economists, politicians and even the average citizen can agree we may only be days or weeks away from the next terrible event that could literally change the face of life as we know it.
[01:53:09.380 --> 01:53:09.660]  Let's do it!
[01:53:30.117 --> 01:53:31.358]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:53:31.358 --> 01:53:35.921]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:53:35.921 --> 01:53:41.725]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:53:41.725 --> 01:53:45.367]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:53:45.367 --> 01:53:48.089]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:53:48.089 --> 01:53:53.152]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:53:53.152 --> 01:53:53.393]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:53:53.393 --> 01:53:54.794]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:54:13.969 --> 01:54:20.974]  Look, folks, if you're amazed by our decline into absolute despotism, don't be.
[01:54:20.974 --> 01:54:22.736]  The founders pointed it out.
[01:54:22.736 --> 01:54:24.617]  It's historical fact.
[01:54:24.617 --> 01:54:25.899]  Tyranny is the norm.
[01:54:27.052 --> 01:54:34.475]  And we're going to get a particularly nasty version of tyranny because we're so naive, because we're Americans and it can't happen here.
[01:54:34.475 --> 01:54:40.057]  I mean, the police don't secretly all over the country take a hundred bucks, a thousand bucks out of your wallet.
[01:54:40.057 --> 01:54:42.498]  Just no drugs, no arrest.
[01:54:42.498 --> 01:54:44.059]  They publicly do it.
[01:54:44.059 --> 01:54:50.281]  Public schools don't watch kids at home over their government laptops in the shower or in the bed.
[01:54:50.281 --> 01:54:52.182]  Secretly, they brag about it.
[01:54:52.702 --> 01:54:56.225]  The TSA doesn't secretly stick their hands down your child's pants.
[01:54:56.225 --> 01:54:57.746]  They do it publicly.
[01:54:57.746 --> 01:55:06.832]  So there's an open breaking of the will happening, but I see a huge awakening happening, and tyranny will just continue until it finally collapses.
[01:55:06.832 --> 01:55:07.492]  Dr. Roberts?
[01:55:08.593 --> 01:55:10.254]  In closing, always great to have you.
[01:55:10.254 --> 01:55:12.395]  Appreciate your wonderful articles.
[01:55:12.395 --> 01:55:17.598]  You write for InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and thousands of other great sites out there.
[01:55:17.598 --> 01:55:19.659]  Your tireless dedication to liberty.
[01:55:19.659 --> 01:55:26.703]  I was on vacation for a couple days but listening to you while on the Texas beach with Paul Watson just laying out the Bin Laden situation.
[01:55:26.703 --> 01:55:28.924]  We've only got about three minutes left.
[01:55:28.924 --> 01:55:30.365]  Any other points on that subject?
[01:55:31.516 --> 01:55:32.096]  Yes, Alex.
[01:55:32.096 --> 01:55:44.561]  You know, a very important point is that there's been no White House ceremony with the President conveying medals on these heroic SEALs who captured and killed the world's most dangerous men.
[01:55:44.561 --> 01:55:49.763]  Now, what President would miss a public relations opportunity like that?
[01:55:51.658 --> 01:55:52.799]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:55:52.799 --> 01:55:56.320]  Or the body, or throwing it in the ocean, or a photo.
[01:55:56.320 --> 01:56:08.606]  Yes, of course, but we've already covered that, mentioned that, but this is something I've not seen anyone say anything about, and I didn't stick it in my columns, but surely
[01:56:09.506 --> 01:56:20.435]  With the Seals' triumphant return, they would have been awarded medals in the White House by the President before a national TV audience.
[01:56:20.435 --> 01:56:22.236]  And they would have retired that group of Seals.
[01:56:22.236 --> 01:56:25.439]  They say, well, they're so secretive in their missions, you can't see them.
[01:56:25.439 --> 01:56:30.323]  He would have at least had the secret ceremony with them being brought in and then coming out and thanking them.
[01:56:30.323 --> 01:56:32.004]  Oh, it's unbelievable.
[01:56:32.004 --> 01:56:36.768]  Listen, they wouldn't... He would sacrifice the Seals for the publicity.
[01:56:37.248 --> 01:56:38.049]  Oh yeah.
[01:56:38.049 --> 01:56:46.554]  Yeah, now some people say, oh well, they had to hide the seals because these brave men would be marked by Al Qaeda and terminated.
[01:56:46.554 --> 01:56:47.474]  Really?
[01:56:47.474 --> 01:56:54.419]  I really believe that Al Qaeda is going to penetrate the bases and get the seals.
[01:56:54.419 --> 01:56:57.541]  But I think that is another giveaway.
[01:56:57.541 --> 01:57:04.105]  Now you may know as well that recently the Pakistani news agency, the equivalent to the BBC in Pakistan,
[01:57:05.105 --> 01:57:24.830]  I put out a news report from eyewitnesses who they identified and had speaking on camera that there were three helicopters only one landed and 12 people got out went in the house came back and the people got in the helicopter and as it lifted off it exploded and every man was killed.
[01:57:24.830 --> 01:57:27.791]  There were dead bodies everywhere pieces of bodies.
[01:57:28.371 --> 01:57:30.475]  And that's exactly how they operate.
[01:57:30.475 --> 01:57:32.398]  That's exactly what they would do.
[01:57:32.398 --> 01:57:36.626]  Send the seals out on a drill, blow it up, and then say they got bin Laden.
[01:57:36.626 --> 01:57:38.609]  I mean, of course they're going to kill the witnesses.
[01:57:38.609 --> 01:57:40.292]  I mean, that's the only way that they operate it.
[01:57:40.292 --> 01:57:40.913]  That's standard.
[01:57:41.533 --> 01:57:47.517]  Well, you know, it's hard to know what's true and what's not true.
[01:57:47.517 --> 01:57:51.559]  It's hard to know why the Pakistan would put out a false story like that.
[01:57:51.559 --> 01:57:53.260]  We've got no way of knowing.
[01:57:53.260 --> 01:58:02.546]  But what we do know is that nobody in American media asked about it or looked into it or said, could anything like this have happened?
[01:58:02.546 --> 01:58:04.207]  Is this the reason there's nobody?
[01:58:04.207 --> 01:58:07.129]  Is this the reason there are no seals getting medals?
[01:58:07.129 --> 01:58:08.390]  I mean, what?
[01:58:08.390 --> 01:58:09.250]  So who knows?
[01:58:11.091 --> 01:58:15.112]  There's so many things that we just overlook.
[01:58:15.112 --> 01:58:21.234]  There's so much potential evidence, different explanations, and they never even get into the public's consciousness.
[01:58:21.234 --> 01:58:26.335]  Now we're told just believe whatever government tells you, even though they have a history of congenital lying.
[01:58:26.335 --> 01:58:28.976]  Paul Craig Roberts, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[01:58:28.976 --> 01:58:32.037]  Look forward to speaking to you in the near future.
[01:58:32.037 --> 01:58:33.517]  Same here, Alex.
[01:58:33.517 --> 01:58:36.478]  We'll be right back with Dr. Steve Pucinich on the other side.
[01:58:36.478 --> 01:58:37.058]  Stay with us.
[01:58:42.321 --> 01:58:43.745]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:43.745 --> 01:58:46.553]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.808 --> 01:58:53.791]  It could never happen in America, but it's happening right now.
[01:58:53.791 --> 01:58:57.414]  Gas prices are exploding past the incomes of millions of families.
[01:58:57.414 --> 01:59:04.020]  As gas prices and crop failures push high food costs, you can still get the best food on the planet from eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:59:04.020 --> 01:59:09.424]  Demand for food is high, but eFoodsDirect has plenty of radiation-free food to meet your needs.

[01:59:41.075 --> 01:59:42.035]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:42.035 --> 01:59:43.736]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.458 --> 02:00:10.284]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.284 --> 02:00:11.886]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.886 --> 02:00:13.427]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.427 --> 02:00:17.632]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.632 --> 02:00:21.697]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:27.981 --> 02:00:30.805]  We've got Dr. Jerome Corsi joining us tomorrow.
[02:00:30.805 --> 02:00:39.277]  He says he's got the proof, and is going to be breaking it tomorrow, that the birth certificate is a group of composites.
[02:00:41.417 --> 02:00:43.939]  We're working on getting Steve Pachinik on the show.
[02:00:43.939 --> 02:00:45.079]  I talked to him yesterday.
[02:00:45.079 --> 02:00:47.321]  He said he was set for 2 o'clock Eastern.
[02:00:47.321 --> 02:00:48.842]  That's right now.
[02:00:48.842 --> 02:00:57.428]  And we'll work on getting him on the show to talk about a host of issues like banned terror group seeks U.S.
[02:00:57.428 --> 02:00:58.009]  rebirth.
[02:00:58.854 --> 02:01:06.880]  I know Pchenik says he listens to the show off and on, so if he's listening right now, doc, your phone's... sounds like it's not disconnected, but goes right to voicemail.
[02:01:06.880 --> 02:01:11.183]  Might have been knocked off the hook, that happens some at my house, or a cordless phone gets left on.
[02:01:11.183 --> 02:01:12.744]  That happens sometimes with guests.
[02:01:12.744 --> 02:01:16.246]  But he wanted to talk about this article, Banned Terror Group Seeks U.S.
[02:01:16.246 --> 02:01:19.229]  Rebirth, an Iranian exile group once called
[02:01:20.330 --> 02:01:20.510]  I think?
[02:01:37.745 --> 02:01:48.792]  So, when we come back from break, and we'll go a little bit into overdrive next hour, Dr. Steve Pachinik will be joining us, coming up here in about five minutes.
[02:01:48.792 --> 02:01:51.213]  In other news, you heard Dr. Paul Craig Roberts earlier.
[02:01:51.213 --> 02:01:53.855]  I don't like Dominique Stauss-Kahn.
[02:01:53.855 --> 02:01:55.956]  He's the head of the Socialist Party.
[02:01:55.956 --> 02:02:00.959]  He's a big Bilderberg group globalist, but he had been splitting
[02:02:01.639 --> 02:02:03.000]  We're good to go.
[02:02:25.017 --> 02:02:31.201]  Nicholas Sarkozy admits that they knew about the fact that they were about to arrest him before it even happened.
[02:02:31.201 --> 02:02:37.485]  Another staffer for Sarkozy put a Twitter out before he was even arrested.
[02:02:37.485 --> 02:02:42.208]  Or as they were going to get him at the airport and claimed that they had sources at the hotel.
[02:02:42.208 --> 02:02:45.110]  So you see the intelligence operation all over this.
[02:02:45.110 --> 02:02:50.494]  There's just so much action happening right now because all of this stuff is starting to come to a head.
[02:02:51.638 --> 02:03:19.144]  And you have Esquire, this known mouthpiece for the Democrats, boldly, boldly coming out and putting out a hoax article yesterday and not telling people it was a hoax until later in the afternoon, saying they talked to Joseph Farah, owner of WorldNetDaily and publisher of Where's the Birth Certificate, and that he was apologizing that the book was a lie and that he was going to recall the book and give everybody's money back when the book was a bestseller.
[02:03:21.126 --> 02:03:29.390]  That's economic espionage to cause bookstores to have a run of people trying to get their money back so that they then pull the book from the store shelves.
[02:03:29.390 --> 02:03:32.351]  I mean, that is a super desperate dirty trick.
[02:03:32.351 --> 02:03:36.494]  If the birth certificate gets discredited, if that's all put to bed, why do that?
[02:03:36.494 --> 02:03:46.739]  In about an hour or so, we have a video going up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com that breaks all this down and shows all the documentation for it.
[02:03:46.739 --> 02:03:48.420]  So that is coming up.
[02:03:49.961 --> 02:03:50.382]  I don't
[02:04:08.144 --> 02:04:21.265]  Israel's got to give up most of the land it's taken since 67, all at the same time telling us that these are great freedom-fighting forces in the Middle East, even though a lot of them are al-Qaeda, in
[02:04:22.961 --> 02:04:34.353]  Sudan in Libya in other areas and then a magic bin Laden tape comes out from the grave Agreeing with this saying these are great freedom fighters.
[02:04:34.353 --> 02:04:40.720]  I mean this is baloney and So it's all coming up with dr. Steve pachec on the other side.
[02:04:40.720 --> 02:04:41.901]  We also have the Pakistani
[02:04:42.862 --> 02:04:46.385]  Military coming out saying more helicopters fly into their country.
[02:04:46.385 --> 02:04:47.906]  They're going to open up on them.
[02:04:47.906 --> 02:04:53.750]  We already had a shootout and people being wounded on the Pakistani side Monday with a helicopter.
[02:04:53.750 --> 02:04:57.653]  It's all coming up with Steve Pucinich on the other side.
[02:04:57.653 --> 02:04:58.073]  Stay with us.
[02:05:02.456 --> 02:05:04.918]  And you're subject to other police action.
[02:05:04.918 --> 02:05:06.199]  Tyranny is here.
[02:05:06.199 --> 02:05:09.861]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:05:09.861 --> 02:05:12.362]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:05:12.362 --> 02:05:18.226]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:05:18.226 --> 02:05:24.450]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:05:24.890 --> 02:05:30.875]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:05:30.875 --> 02:05:35.039]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:05:35.039 --> 02:05:39.343]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:05:39.343 --> 02:05:45.268]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[02:05:45.268 --> 02:05:48.851]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:05:48.851 --> 02:05:50.812]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:05:50.812 --> 02:05:51.253]  It's here.

[02:06:03.356 --> 02:06:08.657]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:06:08.657 --> 02:06:10.198]  Saving means to make money.
[02:06:10.198 --> 02:06:18.980]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:06:19.720 --> 02:06:27.263]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:06:27.263 --> 02:06:35.266]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:06:35.266 --> 02:06:40.488]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[02:07:00.148 --> 02:07:04.691]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:07:04.691 --> 02:07:05.611]  Number 1.
[02:07:05.611 --> 02:07:09.034]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:07:09.034 --> 02:07:09.894]  Number 2.
[02:07:09.894 --> 02:07:14.777]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:07:14.777 --> 02:07:15.538]  It's true.
[02:07:15.538 --> 02:07:20.401]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:07:20.401 --> 02:07:21.221]  Number 3.
[02:07:21.221 --> 02:07:24.824]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:07:24.824 --> 02:07:28.526]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:07:28.706 --> 02:07:29.507]  Number 4.
[02:07:29.507 --> 02:07:32.269]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:07:32.269 --> 02:07:35.953]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:07:35.953 --> 02:07:36.754]  Number 5.
[02:07:36.754 --> 02:07:40.897]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:07:40.897 --> 02:07:45.662]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:07:45.942 --> 02:07:50.106]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:50.106 --> 02:07:51.908]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:51.908 --> 02:07:54.150]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[02:07:57.974 --> 02:07:58.975]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:24.116 --> 02:08:31.688]  Alright, we'll undoubtedly at least go 30 minutes into overdrive next hour so we can take your calls for Dr. Steve Pachinik.
[02:08:31.688 --> 02:08:35.193]  This is now, what, his fifth visit with us in the last two weeks.
[02:08:36.386 --> 02:08:43.289]  Dr. Steve Pucinich was Deputy Assistant Secretary under Henry Kissinger of State, Cyrus Vance James Baker.
[02:08:43.289 --> 02:08:48.111]  His expertise includes foreign policy, international crisis management, and psychological warfare.
[02:08:48.111 --> 02:08:52.933]  He served the presidential administrations of Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H.W.
[02:08:52.933 --> 02:08:54.074]  Bush in the capacity
[02:08:54.774 --> 02:08:54.954]  I think?
[02:09:13.809 --> 02:09:38.677]  Jack Ryan character that's on record but they modeled that after and he also of course is you go to IMDB International Movie Database all the films and TV shows that he's been behind and we're gonna cover the waterfront today I said what do you want to talk about and he said well I want to get into GM with our money financing a celebration of the Communist Party in China that's worse than New York lighting up the the
[02:09:40.674 --> 02:09:40.794]  I'm
[02:09:57.782 --> 02:09:59.543]  I was told this by Hollywood people.
[02:09:59.543 --> 02:10:04.645]  I was told this by famous bodybuilders that contacted me whenever I had the website ArnoldExposed.com.
[02:10:04.645 --> 02:10:05.505]  We still have it.
[02:10:05.505 --> 02:10:12.008]  When he was talking about running for president, we put that out, and part of my film, The Rise of the Police State, covers that.
[02:10:12.008 --> 02:10:22.172]  He wants to get into the Dominique Strauss con thing, all of it, and how this ties into intelligence operations today.
[02:10:22.172 --> 02:10:23.713]  Dr. Pachinnik, good to have you back with us.
[02:10:24.662 --> 02:10:42.569]  It's always a pleasure to be on your show, and I was so irate as a citizen of the United States to read this in the Washington Times on May 18th, which said that, Pickett GM sponsors and celebrates soon-to-be-released QICOM, that's Chinese Communist Propaganda Film.
[02:10:42.569 --> 02:10:45.851]  And for your audience, what this really means is that the head of GM,
[02:10:46.691 --> 02:10:49.873]  Uh, a gentleman by the name of Daniel Ackerson, who was trained at the U.S.
[02:10:49.873 --> 02:10:59.799]  Naval Academy and worked his way up as a lieutenant on a destroyer and then became CEO, thanks to our Treasury Department, has decided to spend our money.
[02:10:59.799 --> 02:11:04.142]  That's my money, your money, ladies and gentlemen, the United States government, where we own
[02:11:05.223 --> 02:11:10.626]  33% of General Motors to finance and sponsor a propaganda film.
[02:11:10.626 --> 02:11:20.033]  That's a communist, Chinese communist propaganda film explaining how great the Chinese Communist Party is since its birth 90 years.
[02:11:20.033 --> 02:11:29.900]  Now, let's differentiate between the Chinese people who have done a wonderful job of making their nation grow, who have resisted this repressive Chinese country,
[02:11:31.181 --> 02:11:31.561]  I think so.
[02:11:47.045 --> 02:11:47.285]  I think?
[02:12:06.902 --> 02:12:12.366]  No one has killed more, not the Nazis, not the Soviet Communists.
[02:12:12.366 --> 02:12:16.849]  The Chinese government admits, under Mao, they say 86 million.
[02:12:16.849 --> 02:12:20.011]  Our State Department says 64 million.
[02:12:20.011 --> 02:12:30.159]  The issue here is, you can pull up the films they shot themselves of old women, children being lined up, their heads being blown off, and this shows who runs our government.
[02:12:30.159 --> 02:12:31.980]  By the way, you have the
[02:12:33.121 --> 02:12:39.224]  Well, you're right, Alex, because this gentleman, Daniel Akerson, was a member of which group?
[02:12:39.224 --> 02:12:41.084]  The Carlisle Group out of Washington.
[02:12:41.084 --> 02:12:48.827]  Once again, that has been indicted for all kinds of malfeasance experiences and unusual activities financially.
[02:12:48.827 --> 02:12:52.049]  But more importantly, he was appointed by a Treasury Department.
[02:12:52.049 --> 02:12:54.930]  So this is what I'm asking the Chinese citizens to do.
[02:12:54.930 --> 02:12:57.271]  Go on Sina, S-I-N-A and Twitter.
[02:12:57.811 --> 02:12:58.192]  I think so.
[02:13:13.189 --> 02:13:15.351]  They initiated the war in Korea.
[02:13:15.351 --> 02:13:17.653]  They assisted in the Vietnam War.
[02:13:17.653 --> 02:13:23.718]  They assisted, they slaughtered millions, which you said 60 to 80 million, in the Cultural Revolution.
[02:13:23.718 --> 02:13:32.144]  They then went on to Cambodia to assist the auto genocide of the killing of the Cambodians themselves, without any apologies.
[02:13:32.144 --> 02:13:36.188]  And then they go forth in Tiananmen Square to suppress their own people.
[02:13:36.188 --> 02:13:39.090]  And now they have the Jasmine Revolutions.
[02:13:39.090 --> 02:13:42.353]  That means the young people who want to protest, the truck drivers,
[02:13:42.853 --> 02:13:54.783]  The cab drivers, and I say to our Chinese friends and our Chinese colleagues, the citizens of China, who are consuming our products, go on Sina, S-I-N-A, and Twitter your disappointments.
[02:13:54.783 --> 02:13:57.565]  Go into the streets and refuse to accept this.
[02:13:57.565 --> 02:14:10.456]  And then I say to our American colleagues, go Twitter and tell your congressmen and senators to stop this egregious, egregious anti-American behavior and to stop funding Chinese propaganda.
[02:14:11.650 --> 02:14:27.053]  Well it shows just how insane this White House is running GM and then using our tax money to finance something worshipping Mao Zedong.
[02:14:27.053 --> 02:14:29.514]  We have all these restaurants opening called Mao's.
[02:14:29.514 --> 02:14:32.394]  The college kids are wearing Mao shirts.
[02:14:32.394 --> 02:14:34.995]  These could not be bigger useful idiots.
[02:14:34.995 --> 02:14:41.296]  Mao Zedong, the Chinese government even admits, did not bathe, had sex with about six women a day,
[02:14:41.696 --> 02:14:50.401]  Was a degenerate piece of arrogant filth and this murdering blob of pus is being worshipped with our tax money.
[02:14:50.401 --> 02:14:55.184]  It just shows how completely reprobate the federal government has become.
[02:14:55.184 --> 02:14:57.846]  They are a pack of criminals worshipping another criminal.
[02:14:58.800 --> 02:14:59.681]  That's correct.
[02:14:59.681 --> 02:15:28.122]  I think this is really criminal activity, considering that this man, Akerson, again, and particularly Cadillac division of GM&GM, is assisting in abetting an entity, the Chinese Communist Party, not the Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, that initiated a war and killed, and assisted in killing thousands of our troops in war throughout, and then through Vietnam War, and then through the war in Indonesia,
[02:15:28.602 --> 02:15:30.343]  Yeah, in Cambodia.
[02:15:30.343 --> 02:15:31.484]  And this has not stopped.
[02:15:31.484 --> 02:15:32.905]  And they're killing their own people.
[02:15:32.905 --> 02:15:34.405]  So it is reprehensible.
[02:15:34.405 --> 02:15:42.730]  But once again, we're going back to the fact that we have civilian leaders who are in cahoots with your big politicians.
[02:15:42.730 --> 02:15:44.171]  Politicians didn't stop this.
[02:15:44.171 --> 02:15:46.312]  This had to come out of the Washington Times.
[02:15:46.312 --> 02:15:47.853]  Not one Republican stood up.
[02:15:47.853 --> 02:15:49.574]  Not one Democrat stood up.
[02:15:49.574 --> 02:15:55.057]  Not Michael Levin, a senator from Michigan, to say cease and desist.
[02:15:55.057 --> 02:15:56.378]  There is absolutely no
[02:15:56.878 --> 02:15:58.239]  Well, they're doing it on purpose!
[02:15:58.239 --> 02:15:59.640]  They're doing it on purpose!
[02:16:12.711 --> 02:16:12.911]  This is
[02:16:27.911 --> 02:16:28.712]  We've had a U.S.
[02:16:28.712 --> 02:16:31.814]  helicopter go into Pakistan, a shootout.
[02:16:31.814 --> 02:16:37.778]  General Hamid Gul said there's no doubt now that there's a move towards starting some new war with them.
[02:16:37.778 --> 02:16:41.040]  Ron Paul has come out today and said the scuttlebutt is.
[02:16:41.040 --> 02:16:48.525]  There is moves in Congress and discussions about some type of occupation of Pakistan.
[02:16:48.525 --> 02:16:53.469]  It's now come out in the big Pakistani papers that that reported CIA agent was trying to get
[02:16:53.849 --> 02:16:54.489]  We're good to go.
[02:17:25.917 --> 02:17:28.700]  Let me say what I said a week ago in all.
[02:17:28.700 --> 02:17:36.048]  I go back to, and I go to the singular individual, I go to the respect of the Secretary of Defense Gates, who said it very clearly today.
[02:17:36.778 --> 02:17:39.861]  We have embarrassed the Pakistani military.
[02:17:39.861 --> 02:17:41.022]  It's enough.
[02:17:41.022 --> 02:17:42.182]  And we should go on.
[02:17:42.182 --> 02:17:45.986]  The issue that happened with Pakistan and the actual raid.
[02:17:45.986 --> 02:17:47.587]  We're not talking about Osama Bin Laden.
[02:17:47.587 --> 02:17:49.829]  I told you he's been dead for 10 years.
[02:17:49.829 --> 02:18:02.279]  But the raid was a PsyOps operation to basically embarrass the ISI into basically getting out of the business of controlling the government of Pakistan, whose president is Khawani.
[02:18:02.859 --> 02:18:08.704]  Dalani and the civil government in Pakistan cannot handle the Inner Service Intelligence Agency.
[02:18:08.704 --> 02:18:14.870]  Yesterday and the day before, the head of ISI resigned and saying I can no longer function.
[02:18:14.870 --> 02:18:27.121]  What I think this raid is about, I was not told, was, and I think Gates has said it very clearly, that we have embarrassed the Pakistani ISI, that basically they want a civilian government in Pakistan
[02:18:27.581 --> 02:18:36.186]  China has moved in, in effect, to help the Pakistani, but I do not believe, again, I will reiterate, I do not believe we will occupy Pakistan.
[02:18:36.186 --> 02:18:45.352]  We do not have the capability, we don't have the desire, and once again, Gates reported, and correctly so, and we've known this for a long time in the national security arena,
[02:18:45.712 --> 02:18:48.236]  We cannot fight two and a half wars anymore.
[02:18:48.236 --> 02:18:52.042]  Our force structure in America was geared for two and a half wars.
[02:18:52.042 --> 02:18:58.372]  That is, one war in the Atlantic, one war on the Pacific, and then a half a war somewhere wherever we need it.
[02:18:58.372 --> 02:19:01.017]  We cannot do that anymore because of budget constraints.
[02:19:01.637 --> 02:19:12.442]  And we go back to the key issue, Alex, as you said repeatedly, our biggest national security problem is not Osama Bin Laden, who's been dead, or al-Qaeda, which is a Haqqani group.
[02:19:12.442 --> 02:19:18.945]  It's really our debt and our ceiling and the fact that we are financially in serious trouble.
[02:19:18.945 --> 02:19:24.587]  There isn't one general or one intelligence officer that will disagree with what I'm about to say, that our debt
[02:19:24.967 --> 02:19:28.869]  And our financial crisis is really the national security problem.
[02:19:28.869 --> 02:19:53.059]  The issue in Pakistan was that the ISI Pakistani did not want to control the Haqqani group, that's H-A-Q-Q-A-N-I, who basically have created al-Qaeda representatives in Afghanistan and have been using the surrogates and members of the Haqqani group to really incite confrontation, not only with American troops in Afghanistan, which the Americans
[02:19:53.539 --> 02:19:57.082]  It's decent to say this, but with India, it'd be a huge problem.
[02:20:15.097 --> 02:20:15.377]  I'm good.
[02:20:30.851 --> 02:20:32.092]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:20:32.092 --> 02:20:36.655]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:20:36.655 --> 02:20:42.459]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:20:42.459 --> 02:20:46.101]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:20:46.101 --> 02:20:48.823]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:48.823 --> 02:20:53.886]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[02:20:54.127 --> 02:20:55.528]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:00.751 --> 02:21:02.573]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:21:02.573 --> 02:21:18.127]  The earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear disaster that killed thousands of Japanese citizens is nothing compared to the devastation that could be caused by hyperinflation that will soon hit the United States and could lead to millions of Americans becoming homeless, all caused by the devalued U.S.
[02:21:18.127 --> 02:21:18.468]  dollar.
[02:21:18.468 --> 02:21:23.913]  While the mainstream media continues to ignore inflation, our friends at the National Inflation Association provide
[02:21:24.153 --> 02:21:28.176]  A free weekly newsletter that educates Americans of the facts and truth about the U.S.
[02:21:28.176 --> 02:21:29.377]  economy and inflation.
[02:21:29.377 --> 02:21:39.464]  I urge you to sign up at the NIA's free newsletter at www.inflation.us to learn how you can not only survive but prosper during the upcoming hyperinflation crisis.
[02:21:39.464 --> 02:21:45.047]  Silver has more than doubled since the NIA declared silver the best investment for the next decade on inflation.us.
[02:21:45.868 --> 02:21:55.337]  The NIA's team of expert economists are happy to answer any economic questions you have about inflation, debt, currencies, real estate, precious metals, and commodities.
[02:21:55.337 --> 02:22:00.582]  Visit inflation.us to learn the economic truth that the mainstream media ignores.
[02:22:00.582 --> 02:22:03.104]  Big Berkey water filters are in high demand.

[02:23:00.287 --> 02:23:01.588]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:23:01.588 --> 02:23:07.175]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:23:07.175 --> 02:23:12.200]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:23:12.200 --> 02:23:12.661]  It's true.
[02:23:12.661 --> 02:23:17.226]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:23:17.746 --> 02:23:22.990]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:23:22.990 --> 02:23:30.094]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:23:30.094 --> 02:23:31.215]  And here's the best part.
[02:23:31.215 --> 02:23:37.579]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:23:37.899 --> 02:23:41.080]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:23:41.080 --> 02:23:43.301]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[02:23:43.301 --> 02:23:44.241]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:23:44.241 --> 02:23:44.441]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:23:44.441 --> 02:23:47.882]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:23:47.882 --> 02:23:49.622]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:24:07.967 --> 02:24:09.688]  Dr. Steve Pucinich is our guest.
[02:24:09.688 --> 02:24:11.990]  We're covering the waterfront today.
[02:24:11.990 --> 02:24:17.375]  I wanted to, in this short segment, doctor, and we'll get into a bunch of other issues.
[02:24:19.099 --> 02:24:24.282]  Look at Obama's speech that he just finished up about an hour ago.
[02:24:24.282 --> 02:24:32.527]  For those that just joined us, the president came out and, well here's the headline, Palestinian state must be based on 1967 borders.
[02:24:32.527 --> 02:24:34.048]  That's just more talk.
[02:24:34.048 --> 02:24:36.990]  And they put it in the process, status quo.
[02:24:36.990 --> 02:24:48.117]  But he went on to say these revolutions are great, these revolutions are wonderful, and named Libya, where we know it's Western-backed, and the core group in there is Al-Qaeda.
[02:24:49.197 --> 02:24:53.622]  And we have former Al-Qaeda leaders on record who were fighting U.S.
[02:24:53.622 --> 02:24:54.923]  troops in Iraq.
[02:24:54.923 --> 02:25:04.112]  Regardless of what you think of these wars, this is a schizophrenic policy that they're engaged in.
[02:25:04.112 --> 02:25:07.014]  You know, we're fighting Al-Qaeda in Pakistan, but this is good.
[02:25:07.014 --> 02:25:08.416]  Al-Qaeda over here.
[02:25:08.416 --> 02:25:12.119]  But meanwhile, right on time, Osama bin Laden speaks from the grave
[02:25:13.280 --> 02:25:26.614]  Another audio tape from the cache they found, over a million documents, where they can just make up and project whatever they want, Dr. Pichinnik, and he agrees that these uprisings are great.
[02:25:26.614 --> 02:25:31.759]  What is the whole point of this obviously latest new fake tape being put out?
[02:25:33.191 --> 02:25:36.493]  Well, the new fake tape is, once again, the issues I said.
[02:25:36.493 --> 02:25:38.534]  Some of them haven't been dead for 10 years.
[02:25:38.534 --> 02:25:48.539]  So, basically, what I think their point is, as the raid was, or whatever the raid was constituted, was to basically say to those Al Qaeda members around the world of those,
[02:25:49.139 --> 02:25:57.903]  Who still fear the United States, or might fear the United States, that there is information in here that we can pursue you, we know where you are.
[02:25:57.903 --> 02:26:07.287]  And at the same time, it's intended to embarrass the Pakistani ISI and the Service Intelligence Agency to say, you know, this is where the man lived.
[02:26:07.287 --> 02:26:09.928]  He lived right near your military institute.
[02:26:10.388 --> 02:26:12.949]  And how come you didn't do anything about it?
[02:26:12.949 --> 02:26:17.510]  It's a way of our pulling out of Pakistan, not to create a war.
[02:26:17.510 --> 02:26:18.511]  We don't need a war now.
[02:26:18.511 --> 02:26:20.671]  We can't fight a war.
[02:26:20.671 --> 02:26:25.773]  And literally try to transfer the power into the civilian area.
[02:26:25.773 --> 02:26:32.855]  But what you said about Obama is that he is not in control of the foreign policy, nor would you expect him to be in control.
[02:26:32.855 --> 02:26:36.216]  Many of his members of the national security are civilians.
[02:26:36.636 --> 02:26:38.217]  We've had very little experience.
[02:26:38.217 --> 02:26:41.878]  Donlan, as I said before, is a lobbyist for Fannie Mae.
[02:26:41.878 --> 02:26:44.119]  That's your national security advisor.
[02:26:44.119 --> 02:26:49.100]  And the one he relies on is a guy named Dennis Ross who worked for me 20, 30 years ago.
[02:26:49.100 --> 02:26:53.022]  Totally ineffectual individual who worked for both Republicans and Democrats.
[02:26:53.022 --> 02:27:01.785]  Has no history of any accomplishments other than self-aggrandizement and the ability to egregiously get himself into situations.
[02:27:02.225 --> 02:27:07.047]  We're more talented people than himself, like Danny Kurtzer and others who work for Bush.
[02:27:07.047 --> 02:27:12.789]  And other, uh, Aaron Miller and other people I know are far more talented than he is.
[02:27:12.789 --> 02:27:23.233]  So you have very incompetent, exceedingly incompetent individuals, including Hillary Clinton, who really has no idea what the national security issues are, nor the strategy.
[02:27:23.673 --> 02:27:29.618]  The fact that the young kids are protesting is not an issue that was initiated by the United States.
[02:27:29.618 --> 02:27:32.100]  Tunisia was spontaneous.
[02:27:32.100 --> 02:27:34.461]  Egypt was assisted by the U.S.
[02:27:34.461 --> 02:27:35.042]  government.
[02:27:35.042 --> 02:27:37.764]  But we had military-to-military contact.
[02:27:37.764 --> 02:27:41.387]  So I do congratulate our military on that, particularly our army.
[02:27:41.907 --> 02:27:50.293]  Where they did maintain control over the Egyptian riots and were able to maintain a stabilized situation.
[02:27:50.293 --> 02:27:57.557]  But in fact, what remains in Egypt and in Libya and elsewhere is really military force structures.
[02:27:57.557 --> 02:28:00.139]  In other words, whatever is related to our military.
[02:28:00.139 --> 02:28:05.102]  The real issue for us right now is Syria is toppling over.
[02:28:05.102 --> 02:28:06.103]  Syria has never been
[02:28:06.583 --> 02:28:07.785]  A real ally of us.
[02:28:07.785 --> 02:28:11.630]  Ashir Assad is a physician, he's an ophthalmologist.
[02:28:11.630 --> 02:28:16.436]  I was interrogated by Syrian officials a couple of years ago for five, six hours.
[02:28:16.436 --> 02:28:25.107]  No, I saw in major news reports that even previous to that, don't you know, was it the senior or the junior Assad?
[02:28:26.414 --> 02:28:32.880]  The senior, I knew the senior side, whom we had worked, I had worked against repeatedly over 20, 30 years.
[02:28:32.880 --> 02:28:42.448]  He was a vicious, exceedingly dangerous man who had created a lot of terrorist episodes and every time we came close to a peace treaty,
[02:28:42.888 --> 02:28:47.472]  In the Middle East, he could create incidences where people were just killed.
[02:28:47.472 --> 02:28:52.716]  And he initiated wars against Israel and basically was a really evil man.
[02:28:52.716 --> 02:28:57.440]  He killed 10,000 to 20,000 so-called Muslims in Hama.
[02:28:57.440 --> 02:28:59.021]  And he had no qualms about it.
[02:28:59.021 --> 02:29:01.323]  Now, his son is very ineffectual.
[02:29:01.323 --> 02:29:04.085]  The people who are protesting, I encourage them.
[02:29:04.085 --> 02:29:07.288]  They're in Aleppo, Hama, Khonsat.
[02:29:08.887 --> 02:29:11.369]  Uh, Latakia, these are wonderful people.
[02:29:11.369 --> 02:29:15.811]  30% of Syria country, what most people don't realize, are Christians.
[02:29:15.811 --> 02:29:18.813]  Uh, the rest are Sunni, Shiite, Druze.
[02:29:18.813 --> 02:29:20.994]  Uh, the northern part of Syria is Kurds.
[02:29:20.994 --> 02:29:24.396]  The Kurds are now separating from Iraq, which I agree with.
[02:29:24.396 --> 02:29:27.597]  The Kurds are separating from Syria, which I agree with.
[02:29:27.597 --> 02:29:31.519]  And so, uh, Bashir Assad either has to go.
[02:29:31.519 --> 02:29:32.180]  He must go.
[02:29:32.680 --> 02:29:41.386]  And I do agree with the administration putting on an embargo on it, but we should pull our ambassador out, and our military will not be engaged in this.
[02:29:41.386 --> 02:29:44.748]  This is an issue that Bashir Assad has to deal with.
[02:29:44.748 --> 02:29:46.089]  All right, stay there.
[02:29:46.089 --> 02:29:46.910]  Doc, we got to go to break.
[02:29:46.910 --> 02:29:49.652]  We're going to come back and continue looking at geopolitical issues.
[02:29:49.652 --> 02:29:51.253]  Then you want to talk about Schwarzenegger.
[02:29:51.253 --> 02:29:52.654]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.654 --> 02:29:54.155]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.149 --> 02:30:00.950]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.950 --> 02:30:03.930]  It could never happen in America, but it's happening right now.
[02:30:03.930 --> 02:30:07.571]  Gas prices are exploding past the incomes of millions of families.
[02:30:07.571 --> 02:30:14.172]  As gas prices and crop failures push high food costs, you can still get the best food on the planet from eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:30:14.172 --> 02:30:19.553]  Demand for food is high, but eFoodsDirect has plenty of radiation-free food to meet your needs.

[02:30:24.974 --> 02:30:25.234]  We're good.
[02:30:51.266 --> 02:30:51.987]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:30:51.987 --> 02:30:57.170]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:30:57.170 --> 02:30:59.852]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:31:11.519 --> 02:31:16.905]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:31:16.905 --> 02:31:19.948]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:31:19.948 --> 02:31:22.250]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:31:22.250 --> 02:31:28.517]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:31:28.517 --> 02:31:31.680]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:31:31.880 --> 02:31:37.665]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:31:37.665 --> 02:31:39.306]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:31:39.306 --> 02:31:40.607]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:31:40.607 --> 02:31:43.269]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:31:43.269 --> 02:31:47.493]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:31:47.493 --> 02:31:52.136]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.

[02:33:03.834 --> 02:33:04.834]  Big Brother.
[02:33:04.834 --> 02:33:06.495]  Mainstream media.
[02:33:06.495 --> 02:33:07.896]  Government cover-ups.
[02:33:07.896 --> 02:33:09.156]  You want answers?
[02:33:09.156 --> 02:33:11.217]  Well, so does he.

[02:33:44.416 --> 02:33:50.002]  Don't forget, listeners, that we've got Jesse Ventura's new New York Times bestselling, number four.
[02:33:50.803 --> 02:33:59.066]  Sixty-three documents the government doesn't want you to read, along with the excellent new book Big Brother the Orwellian Nightmare Come True by Mark Dice.

[02:34:15.298 --> 02:34:25.425]  It's a super high-quality animated documentary about the history of the private banking cartel, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the whole system.
[02:34:25.425 --> 02:34:30.589]  Excellent documentary, The American Dream, fighting the lying liars, one stupid lie at a time.
[02:34:30.589 --> 02:34:35.353]  Excellent new film that we're carrying, available at InfoWars.com.
[02:34:37.174 --> 02:34:41.236]  Continuing here with our sponsors, efoodsdirect.com.

[02:34:47.038 --> 02:34:48.418]  Get prepared.
[02:34:48.418 --> 02:34:56.801]  Tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, man-made disasters, economic collapse, war, even unemployment are all possible and could happen at any time.
[02:34:56.801 --> 02:34:58.982]  I believe in storable food, firearms, you name it.
[02:34:59.782 --> 02:35:05.627]  Uh, disasters come in many shapes and sizes, but the one constant is they happen suddenly without warning.
[02:35:05.627 --> 02:35:08.029]  This is super high quality, all produced in America.
[02:35:08.029 --> 02:35:12.553]  Food and for a limited time, you can buy three of any other packs and get a fourth free.
[02:35:13.646 --> 02:35:24.569]  For Alex Jones listeners, you wanna go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex, that's efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex, or give them a call at 800-409-5633, 800-409-5633.
[02:35:24.569 --> 02:35:27.090]  Okay, going back to Dr. Steve Pachinick and moving quickly with him,
[02:35:36.764 --> 02:35:46.452]  Doc, let me just get this out of the way right now because we really know your information on Bin Laden is accurate.
[02:35:46.452 --> 02:35:52.737]  Your whole history and all the black ops and overthrow of tyrants and assassinations.
[02:35:52.737 --> 02:35:59.822]  I mean, the more I learn about you, you are not telling people actually all of your considerable
[02:36:00.834 --> 02:36:28.112]  uh... exploits it's actually the opposite so you're more than meets the eye you're more than what you even uh... say you are so we know why uh... you're you're you're the model for the tom clancy uh... character jack ryan but i've had people also respect on uh... like doctor paul craig roberts uh... people like joel skousen and they're intrigued by what you say and they have you know no doubt about uh... you know your overall info but but uh...
[02:36:28.712 --> 02:36:55.917]  Some of their questions mirror what listeners have said, especially Skousen's, and that is, how can you say the government is evil and stage 9-11, and the evidence is Legion, or how can you sit there and then talk about them staging this new raid and say that that's when it's gone bad when, you know, who you work for, Henry Kissinger, George Herbert Walker Bush, I mean, these are people, you mentioned China earlier.
[02:36:55.917 --> 02:36:57.477]  They were involved opening up China.
[02:36:58.297 --> 02:37:03.180]  Folks can argue, well, that's opening them up so then they can be changed into a free market system.
[02:37:03.180 --> 02:37:04.201]  I mean, I understand all the arguments.
[02:37:04.201 --> 02:37:23.653]  I don't want to put words in your mouth, but basically it's the statement of, you come from that power structure and from this secret system, and are you saying that things just went bad in 2001, or why are you going public, or what is the point of this?
[02:37:23.653 --> 02:37:25.715]  I mean, I think I'm encapsulating their question.
[02:37:26.860 --> 02:37:27.721]  Yeah, I understand.
[02:37:27.721 --> 02:37:29.422]  People are wondering who I am and what I am.
[02:37:29.422 --> 02:37:32.124]  Who I am is not as important, although you've said it.
[02:37:32.124 --> 02:37:34.166]  I'm not interested in self-aggrandizing.
[02:37:34.166 --> 02:37:36.888]  If they want to read my books, they're more than happy to.
[02:37:36.888 --> 02:37:39.330]  I'm really not interested in going on TV or anything else.
[02:37:39.330 --> 02:37:42.213]  The reason I went on your show, and I kept saying it, is
[02:37:43.107 --> 02:37:59.888]  I lived in a world which was a grey zone and because of my loyalty to my country, remember to the country, and one of the statements that I make a point of is my country right or wrong, I will still defend my country and my constitution.
[02:37:59.888 --> 02:38:00.749]  I do not care.
[02:38:01.289 --> 02:38:03.670]  Who is in the office of the Presidency.
[02:38:03.670 --> 02:38:10.631]  I care about the office of the Presidency and the Constitution and those men and women who fight for it.
[02:38:10.631 --> 02:38:17.513]  So, if I worked for Henry Kissinger, I was more than happy the next day to protest the war in Vietnam on the streets.
[02:38:17.513 --> 02:38:22.834]  If I worked for J. Senior Bush, I was more than happy to protest what he said.
[02:38:22.834 --> 02:38:25.635]  Only in America, and this is what your public has to understand,
[02:38:26.396 --> 02:38:31.582]  Only in America can one work for a system and at the same time criticize the system.
[02:38:31.582 --> 02:38:33.905]  I can't tell you how important that is.
[02:38:33.905 --> 02:38:36.148]  This is not all or nothing.
[02:38:36.148 --> 02:38:40.754]  Every country throughout history has had a hide behind a bodyguard of lies.
[02:38:41.295 --> 02:38:43.338]  That's the nature of national security.
[02:38:43.338 --> 02:38:58.316]  But when those bodyguards of lies are inflicted upon the public, that is a 9-11, or an LPJ pulling the Gulf of Tonkin, or stand down under the Kennedy, you know, the Kennedys going into a
[02:38:58.596 --> 02:38:59.676]  All over the world.
[02:38:59.676 --> 02:39:08.980]  Then it's the point where guys like me who are American citizens, it doesn't matter what my background is, that's an issue for people to say, well, is he credible or not?
[02:39:08.980 --> 02:39:10.440]  Is he a member of the CFR?
[02:39:10.440 --> 02:39:12.041]  Yeah, I'm a member of the CFR.
[02:39:12.041 --> 02:39:16.803]  I'm also a member of the Association of Former Intelligence Officers of the National Military.
[02:39:16.803 --> 02:39:23.605]  And what I'm trying to say is, in our government, there are so many people who are both in the intelligence community and the military community.
[02:39:23.965 --> 02:39:25.126]  Who feel like I do.
[02:39:25.126 --> 02:39:26.727]  They are American citizens.
[02:39:26.727 --> 02:39:35.515]  You have men and women who are fighting all over the world for reasons they may not understand, and they don't agree with, but still they serve our country.
[02:39:35.515 --> 02:39:42.641]  The people who do not serve our country are the people who are in the process business, which you've been talking about, and that's the bankers.
[02:39:43.261 --> 02:39:45.322]  Basically what you're saying is...
[02:40:01.050 --> 02:40:10.799]  You've been an insider, you've done a... I come out as an American citizen who says, I follow the Constitution and I defend the Constitution with my life.
[02:40:10.799 --> 02:40:14.362]  I serve my country, right or wrong, I still serve it.
[02:40:14.362 --> 02:40:16.284]  But I'm not afraid to die.
[02:40:16.284 --> 02:40:20.488]  I've been sent into missions abroad many, many times where I've offered and volunteered.
[02:40:21.048 --> 02:40:27.732]  But at the same time, I have never been afraid to tell the Jimmy Carter, get the hell out of my crisis center.
[02:40:27.732 --> 02:40:33.835]  I have told other presidents to get out of the way because I've got 500 hostages, and they've done it.
[02:40:33.835 --> 02:40:37.737]  And I'm not afraid to put myself on the line if I have to save lives.
[02:40:37.737 --> 02:40:47.002]  And if that means I've got to save what I think is the American democracy republic, I'm not that grandiose, I'm not a Newt Gingrich or any one of these sociopaths.
[02:40:47.002 --> 02:40:48.503]  I'm willing to say it's enough.
[02:40:48.923 --> 02:40:52.888]  But at the same time, I do not throw out the baby with the bathwater.
[02:40:52.888 --> 02:40:57.314]  We have intelligence operatives and we have intelligence generals who are incredible.
[02:40:57.314 --> 02:41:00.318]  They have four or five master's degrees.
[02:41:00.318 --> 02:41:01.399]  They have PhDs.
[02:41:01.399 --> 02:41:06.405]  These are men who've been in combat, who've served our country, and are watching us civilians
[02:41:06.886 --> 02:41:10.751]  It's spoiling our country and those are the men and women I address.
[02:41:10.751 --> 02:41:23.326]  I address our citizens who have two jobs and free jobs or Alex Jones who comes out on his own and repeatedly is willing to be attacked and be called a conspirator or paranoid.
[02:41:23.326 --> 02:41:25.288]  I mean all the adjectives that I receive.
[02:41:25.288 --> 02:41:26.230]  I don't care about that.
[02:41:26.770 --> 02:41:30.032]  What I care about is to say, yeah, I'm a member of all these things.
[02:41:30.032 --> 02:41:31.132]  I don't necessarily attend them.
[02:41:31.132 --> 02:41:33.854]  I'm also a member of the Red Carpet Lounge at United.
[02:41:33.854 --> 02:41:35.575]  That doesn't mean I always go there.
[02:41:35.575 --> 02:41:53.404]  But what I will not tolerate is when the American government, the government per se, will attack its own people, will denigrate our capabilities in terms of our ability to be productive and to be able to make a living because we're entrepreneurs and because we don't want to be controlled by the government.
[02:41:53.524 --> 02:41:55.165]  Well, let me add a point here.
[02:41:55.165 --> 02:42:01.228]  Let me add a point here because, I mean, regardless, you were right about the bin Laden already being dead after you came on my show.
[02:42:01.228 --> 02:42:02.429]  I've been right about many things.
[02:42:02.429 --> 02:42:04.270]  It's not an issue whether I'm right or wrong.
[02:42:04.270 --> 02:42:08.472]  The real issue, Alex, is what is the American public going to do?
[02:42:08.472 --> 02:42:09.993]  I've been right about 9-11.
[02:42:09.993 --> 02:42:12.534]  I was right it was a stand-down and a false flag.
[02:42:12.534 --> 02:42:15.576]  I teach at the Ward College every year, teaching it.
[02:42:15.576 --> 02:42:17.957]  I was right about anybody you want to say.
[02:42:17.957 --> 02:42:19.598]  It's not about being right.
[02:42:19.598 --> 02:42:21.799]  When a physician tells you you've got cancer,
[02:42:22.219 --> 02:42:23.980]  Believe me, I don't want to be right.
[02:42:23.980 --> 02:42:26.142]  The question is, what do you want to do?
[02:42:26.142 --> 02:42:32.106]  And the answer is, if you do nothing and we go over the same thing, and I repeat, listen, we've got cancer in this country.
[02:42:32.106 --> 02:42:33.407]  It is a disaster.
[02:42:33.407 --> 02:42:34.808]  We have to clean it up.
[02:42:34.808 --> 02:42:38.330]  This president is not qualified to be in charge.
[02:42:38.330 --> 02:42:40.892]  But we don't need a revolution actively.
[02:42:40.892 --> 02:42:42.853]  You've got to have a system that's changed.
[02:42:42.853 --> 02:42:44.895]  Because you're not going to have that president again.
[02:42:44.895 --> 02:42:46.976]  I don't care what you say and do.
[02:42:46.976 --> 02:42:51.279]  And the next one, in turn, will be a Republican, because the system is fixed.
[02:42:51.679 --> 02:42:53.640]  As long as you have electoral college.
[02:42:53.640 --> 02:42:55.501]  Being right is not what I'm interested in.
[02:42:55.501 --> 02:42:59.262]  It's what is the American public going to do and stand up for their rights.
[02:42:59.262 --> 02:43:06.925]  If they decide they don't want to stand up for their rights, they decide they don't want to put anybody in prison for 9-11, that's their decision, not mine.
[02:43:06.925 --> 02:43:18.530]  Well, I admire your courage coming out nine plus years ago saying 9-11 was an inside job and going over evidence and now saying you're willing to talk.
[02:43:19.571 --> 02:43:37.994]  To a grand jury and and how do we ever expect people from the power structure to do the right thing and have the courage you have if when they come out we say well they're from the system and and that's not what Roberts was saying is to some callers and you know to a certain extent a scouse and and and I understand his question Roberts was just saying
[02:43:38.655 --> 02:43:42.600]  Well, why doesn't he go ahead, basically, and tell us who this general is?
[02:43:42.600 --> 02:43:53.173]  Because, you know, then he'll be a lot safer, and they won't come killing, but then you've added that you've got mutually assured destruction, you've got stuff on them waiting to be released if something happens to you.
[02:43:54.184 --> 02:43:55.385]  I'm not worried about it.
[02:43:55.385 --> 02:43:57.147]  Let's forget who Kucinich is.
[02:43:57.147 --> 02:44:00.111]  As you said, I'm not interested in who I am or what I am.
[02:44:00.111 --> 02:44:01.512]  This is not an issue.
[02:44:01.512 --> 02:44:02.313]  This is an issue.
[02:44:02.313 --> 02:44:06.217]  Does the American public understand that this is going on?
[02:44:06.217 --> 02:44:15.007]  If I can tell you Osama bin Laden has been dead for 10 years and no one, but no one in the national security area refuted that statement.
[02:44:15.587 --> 02:44:22.957]  No, but if I can tell you to stand down, 9-11, not one person said in the national security area that that was wrong.
[02:44:22.957 --> 02:44:26.902]  The issue isn't about Steve Pichenik and whether I'm afraid of my life.
[02:44:26.902 --> 02:44:34.291]  The issue is, what do you expect from your politicians who are egregiously spending our money, wasting our money?
[02:44:34.691 --> 02:44:40.274]  Who really are sitting there basically in a collusive relationship.
[02:44:40.274 --> 02:44:42.575]  The word is collusion, my dear friend.
[02:44:42.575 --> 02:44:44.116]  That is, they help each other.
[02:44:44.116 --> 02:44:46.077]  Nothing has changed in our democracy.
[02:44:46.077 --> 02:44:47.618]  We do not have a democracy.
[02:44:47.618 --> 02:44:49.019]  We have a republic.
[02:44:49.019 --> 02:44:55.122]  And the issue is, does the American public want to stand for democracy and have a third party and demand that their
[02:44:55.542 --> 02:44:59.226]  Money not go to the GMs who are sponsoring Chinese propaganda.
[02:44:59.226 --> 02:45:04.212]  Not going to presidents who have to fly all around the country, the world, do nothing.
[02:45:04.212 --> 02:45:09.838]  Not to sponsor presidents who are spending a billion dollars, but to really address the issues of the working class.
[02:45:10.339 --> 02:45:10.939]  No, I agree with you.
[02:45:31.585 --> 02:45:46.549]  They created a nonsensical tea party where Sarah Palin stands up or some other bozo and in a song and dance routine where they co-opt all kinds of issues that are not relevant to the American public and we have two parties that intermingle.
[02:45:46.549 --> 02:45:48.190]  There's nothing there.
[02:45:48.770 --> 02:46:00.153]  So, America has to decide, are we going into a peaceful second revolution, where we're addressing less federal government, we're addressing the local issues of transportation, jobs.
[02:46:00.153 --> 02:46:01.454]  We have no jobs.
[02:46:01.454 --> 02:46:05.515]  We as the American public want to talk about the unemployment, which may be a thing.
[02:46:05.995 --> 02:46:07.156]  18 million people.
[02:46:07.156 --> 02:46:11.039]  When the American press could care less about it, they want to sell papers.
[02:46:11.039 --> 02:46:12.821]  The TV want to sell papers.
[02:46:12.821 --> 02:46:16.444]  What we have to worry about is, where is the jobs, my friend?
[02:46:16.444 --> 02:46:18.165]  Where is our productivity?
[02:46:18.165 --> 02:46:20.427]  Stop whining about the bankers.
[02:46:20.427 --> 02:46:22.048]  The bankers have to go to jail.
[02:46:22.048 --> 02:46:23.969]  Not one banker went to jail.
[02:46:23.969 --> 02:46:27.112]  So instead of the American public continuously being in a rut,
[02:46:27.552 --> 02:46:28.374]  No, I hear you, Doug.
[02:46:44.372 --> 02:46:44.732]  No, no, no.
[02:46:44.732 --> 02:46:47.293]  I mean, I understand where you're coming from.
[02:46:47.293 --> 02:46:54.037]  And the fact is, it overall does become a distraction from the Bin Laden fable and from the 9-11 false flag.
[02:46:54.037 --> 02:46:55.337]  That's what they want you to do.
[02:46:55.337 --> 02:46:57.939]  They want you to be distracted from the key issues.
[02:46:57.939 --> 02:47:01.861]  I mean, the issue of, you know, we have really important issues.
[02:47:01.861 --> 02:47:04.682]  Our economy, as you said, is going downhill.
[02:47:04.682 --> 02:47:06.503]  We're turning around just slightly now.
[02:47:07.023 --> 02:47:10.287]  China has been in an economic war with the United States.
[02:47:10.287 --> 02:47:11.948]  Does people understand what that means?
[02:47:11.948 --> 02:47:21.478]  That means that China has basically been, in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, undercutting everything we've done, every other country has done, and what are we going to do?
[02:47:22.099 --> 02:47:28.782]  Traitors inside the government that have been bought off by these foreign lobbyists, the Chinese in particular, selling us out.
[02:47:28.782 --> 02:47:33.785]  I want to speak to that later, but now I want to shift gears into some of the other topics you brought up.
[02:47:33.785 --> 02:47:39.387]  Dominique Strauss-Kahn, how does that integrate in with these private intelligence networks?
[02:47:39.387 --> 02:47:46.351]  And Schwarzenegger, you talked about the fact that for decades, and now it's coming out, that he has multiple love children.
[02:47:46.351 --> 02:47:50.933]  I know Hollywood folks that told me this years ago and said he's got one with his maid.
[02:47:50.933 --> 02:47:51.213]  Boom!
[02:47:51.653 --> 02:47:53.114]  The years later, they were right.
[02:48:12.612 --> 02:48:14.554]  It was true for the Kennedys.
[02:48:14.554 --> 02:48:31.210]  It's a storyline that goes throughout our entire politics, whether Republican or Democrat, where the issue of family values comes in and a new narrative is created to the American public, whether Republican on the right or the left, buys into this garbage, this absolute nonsense.
[02:48:31.650 --> 02:48:33.911]  Schwarzenegger, you know, I don't know the gentleman.
[02:48:33.911 --> 02:48:35.052]  I worked in Hollywood.
[02:48:35.052 --> 02:48:40.195]  I have heard that he's abusive, whether he's physically abusive or emotionally abusive.
[02:48:40.195 --> 02:48:48.020]  That's for our reporters to decide whether he was on the list of one of the biggest clients for Heidi Fleiss, who ran a prostitution house.
[02:48:48.020 --> 02:48:52.343]  And you see many of her prostitutes in a famous film that Columbia releases.
[02:48:52.343 --> 02:48:54.444]  The point is they use this for blackmail.
[02:48:54.444 --> 02:48:55.585]  Everybody knew.
[02:48:55.585 --> 02:48:56.746]  Why are they bringing it now?
[02:48:56.746 --> 02:48:57.166]  Continue.
[02:48:59.050 --> 02:49:02.932]  They brought it now because I think there was a tipping point.
[02:49:02.932 --> 02:49:04.592]  I have no idea.
[02:49:04.592 --> 02:49:06.173]  He could never get reelected.
[02:49:06.173 --> 02:49:07.994]  He's going back into the movie business.
[02:49:07.994 --> 02:49:10.135]  He's a very shrewd businessman.
[02:49:10.135 --> 02:49:11.595]  You have to admire his business.
[02:49:11.595 --> 02:49:24.160]  But this Maria Shriver notion that a wife of a politician did not know that her husband has been fornicating for the past 20 to 30 years is absolute nonsense.
[02:49:24.580 --> 02:49:29.541]  And she's coming out of the Kennedy family, where you have a genetic history of this fornication.
[02:49:29.541 --> 02:49:32.041]  So this is not a victim, this is not a poor woman.
[02:49:32.041 --> 02:49:36.522]  You're talking about a sadomasochistic relationship that serves her narrative.
[02:49:36.522 --> 02:49:44.804]  She wanted to be on the TV show, she wants her own presence, as the way Hillary Clinton did in an abusive relationship with Mr. Clinton.
[02:49:44.804 --> 02:49:48.825]  Who, by the way, if Hillary... Why do you think Hillary never became president?
[02:49:48.825 --> 02:49:49.845]  And running with Obama?
[02:49:50.485 --> 02:49:55.106]  The real issue wasn't Hillary was either better or worse than Obama.
[02:49:55.106 --> 02:49:56.287]  Nobody knew who Obama was.
[02:49:56.287 --> 02:50:01.588]  The key question at the time of her running was this question that was posed to me by a Democrat.
[02:50:01.588 --> 02:50:09.190]  And the question was, can Hillary win the election if everybody knows that Bill Clinton was still screwing around in California?
[02:50:09.190 --> 02:50:11.630]  And my answer was categorically no.
[02:50:11.630 --> 02:50:13.291]  So you have it on both sides.
[02:50:13.291 --> 02:50:17.812]  You have a man, a woman who's compromised by a manager, and you have a woman
[02:50:18.192 --> 02:50:26.617]  Who's talented in her own ways, Hillary Clinton, and compromised by Bill Clinton, whose narcissism and ego is very equivalent to Schwarzenegger.
[02:50:26.617 --> 02:50:33.802]  So what you have is a dynamic of narcissism, entitlement, and the ability to be abusive in both relationships.
[02:50:34.382 --> 02:50:35.642]  Doc, stay there.
[02:50:35.642 --> 02:50:37.343]  Let me get this straight.
[02:50:37.343 --> 02:50:40.604]  The key is that we're paying for this unnecessarily.
[02:50:40.604 --> 02:50:55.108]  We're paying a lot of money to cover up for the staffs, for the nonsense, for the spinning, and the American public is sick and tired of this, and all we want to do is get our money back, get some candidate who has nothing to do with the issue of sex.
[02:50:55.108 --> 02:50:55.768]  Stay there, Doc.
[02:50:55.768 --> 02:50:56.848]  We got a break.
[02:50:56.848 --> 02:51:00.089]  But there's also the psyop that the media would keep it secret all these years.
[02:51:03.809 --> 02:51:06.150]  Alex Jones here with key information.
[02:51:06.150 --> 02:51:06.710]  The U.S.
[02:51:06.710 --> 02:51:13.993]  government is a Ponzi scheme that relies on the Treasury continuously selling large amounts of government bonds to foreign central banks.
[02:51:13.993 --> 02:51:16.714]  With Japan about to become a seller of U.S.
[02:51:16.714 --> 02:51:20.036]  bonds in order to rebuild its own nation, and the U.S.
[02:51:20.036 --> 02:51:26.699]  antagonizing China by calling them currency manipulators, the Federal Reserve, which is already buying about 70% of U.S.
[02:51:26.699 --> 02:51:29.340]  Treasuries, will soon be the only buyer left of U.S.
[02:51:29.340 --> 02:51:30.220]  Treasuries.
[02:51:30.220 --> 02:51:32.261]  Our friends at the National Inflation Association
[02:51:32.261 --> 02:51:32.761]  We're good to go.

[02:53:29.825 --> 02:53:31.066]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:53:31.066 --> 02:53:35.629]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:53:35.629 --> 02:53:41.433]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:53:41.433 --> 02:53:45.075]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:53:45.075 --> 02:53:47.797]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:53:47.797 --> 02:53:52.861]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:53:52.861 --> 02:53:53.221]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:53:53.221 --> 02:53:54.502]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:53:59.565 --> 02:53:59.770]  We're good.
[02:54:23.249 --> 02:54:31.228]  The issue is if I was contacted by multiple famous bodybuilders whenever I put out a film part of a film exposing Schwarzenegger
[02:54:32.534 --> 02:54:45.698]  We're talking about, hey he's got a son with the maid, he's got another kid with this lady, here's her name, she's a blonde, now you see it in the news, I was told it by Hollywood people, none of this is even a secret.
[02:54:45.698 --> 02:54:53.160]  The women visiting Schwarzenegger every day, but the system allows that so then Schwarzenegger is compromised.
[02:54:53.880 --> 02:54:57.324]  And now we have Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who I'm not a fan of.
[02:54:57.324 --> 02:55:00.226]  He's a big globalist.
[02:55:00.226 --> 02:55:03.009]  Really the elite leader of the Socialist Party in France, but come on.
[02:55:03.009 --> 02:55:05.331]  First it's rape, now it's attempted rape.
[02:55:05.331 --> 02:55:09.576]  The cops are basically saying he's guilty up front, which is always a bad sign.
[02:55:09.576 --> 02:55:16.423]  Now we learn that the chief spin doctor for Sarkozy, Strauss-Kahn, in the polls was set to beat for president.
[02:55:17.043 --> 02:55:18.584]  Next year.
[02:55:18.584 --> 02:55:24.309]  Tweets out, you know, kind of jumps the gun that, oh, he's been arrested for raping this woman.
[02:55:24.309 --> 02:55:26.932]  And then they had another campaign official do it.
[02:55:26.932 --> 02:55:29.774]  And then they said, well, we had an operative at the hotel.
[02:55:29.774 --> 02:55:33.337]  Oh, so now they admit they're following him.
[02:55:33.337 --> 02:55:33.918]  I don't know.
[02:55:33.918 --> 02:55:35.139]  The whole thing's very suspicious.
[02:55:35.139 --> 02:55:39.763]  But finishing up with the media playing along with this, covering up for Schwarzenegger.
[02:55:39.763 --> 02:55:41.864]  And what's going on with Strauss-Kahn?
[02:55:41.864 --> 02:55:43.386]  What's your take on all this, Dr. Pichanik?
[02:55:44.229 --> 02:55:46.230]  Well, I'm not a great fan of Strauss-Kahn.
[02:55:46.230 --> 02:55:51.394]  Number one, I grew up in France, and I came to America because this is a country of opportunity.
[02:55:51.394 --> 02:55:57.617]  France is not a country of opportunity, and quite frankly, France is not relevant to American national security interests.
[02:55:57.617 --> 02:55:59.619]  It's just not relevant.
[02:55:59.619 --> 02:56:03.181]  I think whether it's a setup or not, I think it's pathetic.
[02:56:03.181 --> 02:56:05.542]  The Strauss was always a pathetic figure.
[02:56:05.542 --> 02:56:07.384]  He's always been compromised before.
[02:56:07.384 --> 02:56:12.667]  But, you know, in the world of intelligence, if you have an addiction, and particularly it's a honey trap, that is women,
[02:56:15.899 --> 02:56:21.962]  You know, he deserves what he gets, but it's not really relevant to what we are talking about here in the United States.
[02:56:21.962 --> 02:56:24.844]  The difference with France is they're used to this.
[02:56:24.844 --> 02:56:30.747]  They got upset by the way we handled him in the police station that we should have hidden him, which is nonsense.
[02:56:30.747 --> 02:56:32.328]  France is really not relevant.
[02:56:32.328 --> 02:56:40.012]  It's a country that saw its past 300 years ago, and we should just leave it alone and visit it just because it's basically a museum.
[02:56:40.452 --> 02:56:42.992]  No real viability for the United States.
[02:56:42.992 --> 02:56:50.594]  Let's get back to the United States, which is really the most important country that we're talking about, and why this Schwarzenegger issue is important.
[02:56:50.594 --> 02:56:53.895]  Not because of Schwarzenegger himself, although the story was there.
[02:56:53.895 --> 02:56:57.855]  We do have to give credit to some of the reporters, a woman reporter in the L.A.
[02:56:57.855 --> 02:57:05.017]  Times, who tried to bring up this issue that he was broke and repeatedly was harassing women.
[02:57:05.017 --> 02:57:06.897]  But unfortunately, the nature
[02:57:07.017 --> 02:57:07.698]  It's a circus.
[02:57:07.698 --> 02:57:15.964]  When it comes to power, and you have people like the Clintons or the Schwarzeneggers or the Kennedys or anybody else, it's about power and intimidation.
[02:57:15.964 --> 02:57:19.948]  So the women can't come out, the media gets intimidated, and in turn they try to basically
[02:57:36.341 --> 02:57:36.961]  We're good to go.
[02:57:59.851 --> 02:58:06.538]  And he created the ultimate psyops that he had a family and he was a good family man and so forth and so on.
[02:58:06.538 --> 02:58:11.203]  And so, once again, that psyops that's done domestically is costing us.
[02:58:11.203 --> 02:58:12.504]  Why is this important?
[02:58:12.504 --> 02:58:13.325]  It's not important.
[02:58:13.325 --> 02:58:16.048]  It shows a culture of lies and people being fed lies.
[02:58:17.005 --> 02:58:21.388]  That's correct, but at the same time, let's talk about, let's follow the money, Alex.
[02:58:21.388 --> 02:58:24.650]  This is costing the American public a lot of money.
[02:58:24.650 --> 02:58:27.931]  Millions and hundreds of millions of dollars for the board of staff.
[02:58:27.931 --> 02:58:32.114]  In particular, California, there's a $26 billion deficit.
[02:58:32.114 --> 02:58:35.436]  Terry Brown has to go back in there, whether you like him or not.
[02:58:35.436 --> 02:58:35.956]  Stay there.
[02:58:35.956 --> 02:58:37.077]  Back in one minute, Doc.
[02:58:37.077 --> 02:58:38.138]  Back in one minute.
[02:58:38.138 --> 02:58:39.478]  Going into overdrive live.
[02:58:39.478 --> 02:58:43.681]  Stay with us.

[02:58:52.458 --> 02:58:56.480]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:58:56.480 --> 02:58:59.721]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:58:59.721 --> 02:59:04.523]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:59:04.523 --> 02:59:10.905]  We have tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:59:10.905 --> 02:59:13.146]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:59:13.686 --> 02:59:13.986]  Tim Geithner?
[02:59:13.986 --> 02:59:14.507]  Bernanke?
[02:59:14.507 --> 02:59:15.287]  They're arsonists!
[02:59:15.287 --> 02:59:16.448]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:59:16.448 --> 02:59:18.689]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:59:32.577 --> 02:59:34.439]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:59:34.439 --> 02:59:39.863]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:59:39.863 --> 02:59:51.973]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[03:00:27.682 --> 03:00:27.742]  800-259-9231.
[03:00:27.742 --> 03:00:30.243]  We've been covering a wide spectrum of ideas and information.
[03:00:30.243 --> 03:00:34.004]  I was talking to Doc during the break, and I said, you know, what else do you want to get into?
[03:00:34.004 --> 03:00:34.384]  And he said, well,
[03:00:43.166 --> 03:00:45.609]  You know, Europe's going under.
[03:00:45.609 --> 03:00:47.812]  Their currencies are imploding.
[03:00:47.812 --> 03:00:55.761]  We've got to talk about basically what we face economically and the fact that we need to point out who the big private bankers are.
[03:00:56.909 --> 03:00:58.070]  We're good to go.
[03:01:15.965 --> 03:01:29.882]  Is we're having to finance this political inside crony capitalist class at the expense of all our liberties and our freedom and that America is on a razor's edge and that's why you as an insider are, you know, coming out.
[03:01:31.877 --> 03:01:33.718]  Well, let me put it this way.
[03:01:33.718 --> 03:01:34.498]  I'm not coming out.
[03:01:34.498 --> 03:01:35.359]  I've always been out.
[03:01:35.359 --> 03:01:36.119]  No, I know.
[03:01:36.119 --> 03:01:37.160]  In terms of truth.
[03:01:37.160 --> 03:01:42.723]  And I've been more than happy to take down institutions, whether they're civilian, foreign.
[03:01:42.723 --> 03:01:44.223]  That's not an issue for me.
[03:01:44.223 --> 03:01:47.025]  That's my professional expertise and I've done it.
[03:01:47.498 --> 03:01:47.798]  I don't
[03:02:11.647 --> 03:02:12.087]  I don't know.
[03:02:31.520 --> 03:02:42.492]  The Financial Committee, led by Peter Angelides, wrote a brilliant book, The Financial Crisis in the Inquiry Report, and so did the Senate.
[03:02:42.492 --> 03:02:46.716]  And I think it's time for the American public to demand indictments.
[03:02:46.716 --> 03:02:48.998]  It's not as if we don't know where the crooks are.
[03:02:48.998 --> 03:02:53.403]  They're in Citigroup, they're in Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Chase Manhattan.
[03:02:53.763 --> 03:02:55.363]  Do you have it in Wells Fargo?
[03:02:55.363 --> 03:02:57.344]  Do you have it in the mortgage companies?
[03:02:57.344 --> 03:02:59.984]  They're all listed here in the federal documents.
[03:02:59.984 --> 03:03:11.867]  The answer now is for your public to stop whining, stop complaining, and stop seeing conspiracies and worrying about whether Steve Paget is going to get killed or not because it's hard to spell his last name.
[03:03:11.867 --> 03:03:16.668]  Good God, I mean, I've had Noriega chase me and he can't even spell it correctly every week.
[03:03:17.088 --> 03:03:33.140]  So the issue really to worry about is how do you get these people indicted so the future understands you cannot commit criminal acts, financial acts against the American public, no matter what your name is, and particularly if your name is Goldman Sachs.
[03:03:33.140 --> 03:03:34.981]  And this can't continue.
[03:03:34.981 --> 03:03:37.703]  So that's where the American public has to start.
[03:03:37.703 --> 03:03:39.965]  It has to say, give me back my money.
[03:03:40.165 --> 03:03:41.645]  We're good to go.
[03:03:56.912 --> 03:04:08.588]  That they committed criminal acts, yet nobody has put them in prison because your politicians, the head of your Senate Finance Committee, the subcommittees on finance are all funded by these guys.
[03:04:08.588 --> 03:04:12.414]  So unless the American public demands, through Twitter, protest,
[03:04:12.794 --> 03:04:13.415]  Peacefully.
[03:04:13.415 --> 03:04:16.698]  Demands they be investigated and indicted.
[03:04:16.698 --> 03:04:17.699]  This will not happen.
[03:04:17.699 --> 03:04:19.200]  Now, let me tell you one thing.
[03:04:19.200 --> 03:04:35.155]  It is clear in the Financial Crisis Report that the real heroes of a lot of this institution are the Attorney Generals of the different states, all of whom came in and said the federal rules and regulations are totally inappropriate to have
[03:04:35.955 --> 03:04:50.443]  A lot of the Attorney Generals of the different states should be awarded for the fact that they stood up, including the Manhattan Attorney General, now you have Cyrus Vance Jr.
[03:04:50.443 --> 03:04:52.444]  as an Attorney General in Manhattan.
[03:04:52.444 --> 03:04:55.745]  These people should be applauded for going after these criminals.
[03:05:01.431 --> 03:05:04.453]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[03:05:04.453 --> 03:05:08.455]  Did you know that the United Nations is a Trojan horse?
[03:05:08.455 --> 03:05:15.058]  And that the Secretary General of the United Nations has always been a socialist from the day that it was founded?
[03:05:15.058 --> 03:05:19.260]  Therefore, it can only bring about a one world communist government.
[03:05:19.260 --> 03:05:23.162]  Do you realize that they will be in charge of all weaponry,
[03:05:23.582 --> 03:05:33.890]  If the United States and every other nation turns over to it, any nation that rebels, they will just send a nuclear weapon to bring it into subjection.
[03:05:33.890 --> 03:05:43.938]  We'd like to help you understand how these world events are going to affect you in the near future by offering you a one-year free subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[03:06:18.295 --> 03:06:29.580]  Again, this big event has nothing to do with war or the stock market, yet it could change everything about your normal way of life, the way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your family.
[03:06:29.580 --> 03:06:30.760]  Could this really happen?
[03:06:30.760 --> 03:06:34.762]  Well, the man who created this video has been right about many predictions in his career.
[03:06:34.762 --> 03:06:36.963]  He was among the first to predict the collapse of GM.
[03:06:41.732 --> 03:06:42.132]  We're good.
[03:07:01.365 --> 03:07:05.430]  For centuries, silver has been used as a powerful natural antibiotic.

[03:08:12.339 --> 03:08:13.900]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:13.900 --> 03:08:18.083]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:18.083 --> 03:08:22.145]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:24.284 --> 03:08:27.245]  I was just talking to Dr. Steve Pchenik about how we get this country back.
[03:08:27.245 --> 03:08:29.445]  State's rights, nullification.
[03:08:29.445 --> 03:08:44.387]  He was bringing up all these attorney generals trying to go after Obama with the carbon tax moves, trying to block that, going after Goldman Sachs and others for their criminal activities.
[03:08:44.387 --> 03:08:51.029]  I mean, trillions have been stolen and the President cannot be allowed to stand that they're going to get away with this.
[03:08:51.029 --> 03:08:53.389]  Dr. Pchenik, finish up with that point and we're going to go to some phone calls.
[03:08:54.875 --> 03:09:08.140]  I think Cornel West, who's a professor at Princeton and African American said it best, that Obama is a black man representing the plutocracy and the money interest of Wall Street.
[03:09:08.140 --> 03:09:10.721]  And this is unacceptable.
[03:09:10.721 --> 03:09:12.842]  And he has to be held accountable.
[03:09:12.842 --> 03:09:15.163]  The guys on Wall Street have to go to prison.
[03:09:19.002 --> 03:09:21.023]  I have great faith in the ability for us to hold people accountable.
[03:09:21.023 --> 03:09:22.584]  Let's go to the phones if you want.
[03:09:47.068 --> 03:09:52.673]  Any other points on ideas to expose this kleptocracy, this banking kleptocracy?
[03:10:06.338 --> 03:10:07.919]  And really, what does it do?
[03:10:07.919 --> 03:10:14.664]  It reinsures those people who have to have insurance or create financial instruments that don't exist.
[03:10:14.664 --> 03:10:25.692]  So you have this whole Ponzi scheme that's still in existence where men like Geithner and Bernanke and others who really have never been in the world of real business.
[03:10:25.692 --> 03:10:32.116]  They've all been, quote, policy thinkers, which is something else we have to get rid of because these are the welfare clients.
[03:10:32.176 --> 03:10:32.536]  We're good to go.
[03:10:51.355 --> 03:11:13.756]  Tax-free zones where we can start businesses and getting the American worker back in there, the mechanic, the truck driver who doesn't have to pay $5 a gallon in diesel, the librarian who can make a living, the teachers who make more than $23,000 versus the $68 million that a banker makes for nothing else than just processing paper.
[03:11:16.906 --> 03:11:19.107]  Indispensable, which is absurd.
[03:11:19.107 --> 03:11:24.969]  So the American public has to hold these people accountable, and once we do, we can go forward.
[03:11:24.969 --> 03:11:30.151]  But in the meantime, I think America will be turning around, because China's in trouble right now.
[03:11:30.151 --> 03:11:33.573]  Their interest rates are going up, the middle class is going up.
[03:11:33.573 --> 03:11:43.477]  Again, using Sina and Twitter, I think the Chinese public will attack the Chinese government, and I think the Chinese government has a
[03:11:43.677 --> 03:12:00.345]  It's a very serious problem, and I've said it repeatedly, of trying to suppress 1.3 billion Chinese, and they have a serious water problem right now, they have a serious drought problem, and their money, unlike our own system, is based on social stability.
[03:12:00.345 --> 03:12:10.010]  Where our system of capitalism is based on profit, the Chinese system is based on social stability, which means that if they don't keep outloaning money, that is the Communist Party,
[03:12:10.410 --> 03:12:13.632]  They will have unrest, the likes of which they've never seen.
[03:12:13.632 --> 03:12:14.812]  And let me give you an idea.
[03:12:14.812 --> 03:12:23.577]  In a typical normal year under the Communist Party in China right now, a year ago, they had 75,000 riots for corruption.
[03:12:23.577 --> 03:12:24.998]  That's a normal year.
[03:12:24.998 --> 03:12:34.483]  Now you take a year like now, where you have increased interest rates, unemployment, where students are exceedingly smart in China and very well educated.
[03:12:34.923 --> 03:12:39.764]  Well then, in many cases, our own students, where they speak several languages, and there are no jobs for them.
[03:12:39.764 --> 03:12:44.186]  So the Chinese government has to be put on alert, saying, you're in trouble.
[03:12:44.186 --> 03:12:49.247]  You're in major trouble if you want to expand to Pakistan, you want to expand all over the world.
[03:12:49.247 --> 03:12:52.488]  You've got bigger problems internally than anybody else has.
[03:12:52.488 --> 03:13:01.971]  And now it's our turn to remain a superpower by getting our forces out of Iraq, Afghanistan, and the Middle East, and start to work on redeploying our
[03:13:01.991 --> 03:13:03.671]  Alright, let's go to phone calls.
[03:13:03.671 --> 03:13:05.112]  Good points there.
[03:13:05.112 --> 03:13:07.792]  Bill in Connecticut, you're on the air, welcome.
[03:13:07.792 --> 03:13:09.232]  Yes, hi Alex, hi Dr. Pachonik.
[03:13:09.232 --> 03:13:09.312]  Hi.
[03:13:09.312 --> 03:13:09.992]  I have two points.
[03:13:09.992 --> 03:13:10.252]  First is,
[03:13:30.228 --> 03:13:44.296]  I don't know how we'll be able to resolve the financial mess when, as you said, we have this collusion between the politicians and the banks and even AIG.
[03:13:44.296 --> 03:13:54.142]  So you have the Federal Reserve giving money to both AIG and Goldman Sachs, and AIG was actually
[03:13:55.757 --> 03:13:57.499]  Insuring Goldman Sachs debts.
[03:14:14.158 --> 03:14:19.280]  Well, I think what the gentleman's getting to, and I agree with you, is the only way I can see it is that we have to hold them.
[03:14:19.280 --> 03:14:24.822]  The report says it very clearly, even their own federal report, that we do have to put some people in prison.
[03:14:24.822 --> 03:14:28.063]  Not the Bernie Madoffs only, and not the guys who are inside of trading.
[03:14:28.063 --> 03:14:29.704]  That's a distraction.
[03:14:29.704 --> 03:14:32.345]  You're talking about the President, CEOs of AIG.
[03:14:33.025 --> 03:14:37.949]  You're talking about the President's CEOs, the Goldman Sachs, of JPMorgan.
[03:14:37.949 --> 03:14:59.703]  Once they're in prison, they're going to understand that this is not just a game where you can fool the public, and then you're going to have to put some of your congressmen and senators, like Dodd, Barney Frank, held accountable, Max Baucus, all of these men who've been funded by AIG, JPMorgan, and they think this is all so cute because they can be in bed with them.
[03:14:59.703 --> 03:15:02.505]  That's not going to occur unless the American public insists.
[03:15:03.165 --> 03:15:03.826]  No, I agree.
[03:15:03.826 --> 03:15:05.246]  We need to start beating the drums.
[03:15:05.246 --> 03:15:09.848]  I mean, even Rolling Stone said Senate committee proves it's criminal, send them to prison.
[03:15:09.848 --> 03:15:20.693]  It's time for hundreds of these prominent bankers and some of these members of Congress to be clapped in irons, taken in, given a jury trial, and sent to prison.
[03:15:20.693 --> 03:15:22.494]  And I'm not talking about country clubs.
[03:15:22.494 --> 03:15:24.254]  And that will teach these criminals.
[03:15:24.254 --> 03:15:29.597]  Folks, if you don't keep corruption under control, you will fall apart like North Korea or Mexico.
[03:15:30.397 --> 03:15:31.298]  Let me say something.
[03:15:31.298 --> 03:15:35.320]  Nothing is more humiliating to Wall Street than to see Blankfein or the heads of AIG and other people in Goldman Sachs
[03:15:48.848 --> 03:15:50.148]  Max Morgan, Stanley J.P.
[03:15:50.148 --> 03:15:59.871]  Morgan, literally arrested during the daytime by the FBI, they know how to do it, and trounced right out there in handcuffs, sent to prison.
[03:15:59.871 --> 03:16:15.755]  And let me tell you, that is an effective deterrent to everybody, including if you go into the Senate, you go into Congress, and you look at Barney Franks and Christopher Dodd and Max Baucus, and you look at all the ones in the Financial Senate Committee, both on the Republican and Democrat,
[03:16:16.155 --> 03:16:24.758]  Put handcuffs on them, send them right through the daytime, and show them on TV, and believe me, this will shut down this collusion.
[03:16:24.758 --> 03:16:26.319]  It works very effectively.
[03:16:26.319 --> 03:16:28.180]  It's a counter-psyops, but it works.
[03:16:32.335 --> 03:16:34.616]  You know, the American public has been dumbed down.
[03:16:34.616 --> 03:16:38.118]  I mean, we're dumber than a bag of concrete at this point.
[03:16:38.118 --> 03:16:41.840]  They've got an efficient propaganda arm called mass media.
[03:16:41.840 --> 03:16:45.823]  I mean, it's like, right, I mean, Bin Laden's been dumped in the ocean, what next?
[03:16:45.823 --> 03:16:47.744]  He washes up on Gilligan's Island?
[03:16:47.744 --> 03:16:48.984]  You know what I mean?
[03:16:48.984 --> 03:16:50.765]  It's like, what are we going to be believing next?
[03:16:50.765 --> 03:16:54.528]  How are we going to fight this, you know, when they've got everybody so dumbed down and such?
[03:16:54.528 --> 03:16:56.649]  You know, I mean, the propaganda that they've got is just so bad.
[03:16:56.649 --> 03:17:00.151]  Well, Rand, let me say something, though, and I want you to continue, but look,
[03:17:01.061 --> 03:17:02.823]  Let's get real here.
[03:17:02.823 --> 03:17:04.605]  There's a process of awakening.
[03:17:04.605 --> 03:17:06.647]  People that want to be dumb are spectators.
[03:17:06.647 --> 03:17:07.909]  They're not on the field.
[03:17:07.909 --> 03:17:11.733]  We've got a hundred to one people on the field against these folks.
[03:17:11.733 --> 03:17:15.958]  And so yes, there are some dumbed down people, but there's a big awakening happening.
[03:17:15.958 --> 03:17:18.020]  Congress has a 9% approval rating.
[03:17:18.020 --> 03:17:20.282]  Mainstream media has about a 12.
[03:17:20.282 --> 03:17:22.185]  And so everybody isn't buying it.
[03:17:22.725 --> 03:17:34.012]  Well, it's just that we don't know we're the majority because we still buy that final PSYOP that we're alone because we're not arrogant and that actually plays against us because we are so humble.
[03:17:34.012 --> 03:17:36.933]  The truth is, let me tell you something I told you yesterday.
[03:17:36.933 --> 03:17:46.739]  Okay, just as a bellwether, I am known, my face is known from YouTube, the internet, radio show, newspapers and stuff, okay?
[03:17:46.739 --> 03:17:51.782]  Five years ago, I'd get off a plane in New York, walk down a street for 30 minutes, five people come over to me.
[03:17:52.242 --> 03:17:55.385]  Now I get off a plane in New York and walk, I can't go 10 feet.
[03:17:55.385 --> 03:17:56.866]  I can't eat in restaurants.
[03:17:56.866 --> 03:17:59.268]  I can go to L.A., Austin, anywhere.
[03:17:59.268 --> 03:18:02.151]  I can walk in a bar to pick up food to take home.
[03:18:02.151 --> 03:18:05.674]  Almost everyone, leaves the pool, tables, whatever, comes over to me.
[03:18:05.674 --> 03:18:07.836]  And I'm not going, oh look, Alex Jones is well known.
[03:18:07.836 --> 03:18:14.682]  The point is, is that you have no idea how powerful the Liberty Movement is.
[03:18:14.682 --> 03:18:16.384]  Don't underestimate.
[03:18:16.384 --> 03:18:17.445]  Dr. Pucinich, any comments?
[03:18:19.245 --> 03:18:20.933]  I totally agree with Alex Jones.
[03:18:20.933 --> 03:18:22.602]  I've always been a great supporter of his.
[03:18:26.957 --> 03:18:35.241]  I want you to understand, and I want all of your listeners to understand, the American Revolution was not started by a majority of the people in the United States.
[03:18:35.241 --> 03:18:37.182]  It was started by a few.
[03:18:37.182 --> 03:18:38.762]  I don't have to go over them.
[03:18:38.762 --> 03:18:45.245]  Alex Jones had been remaining in there, and the Thomas Jeffersons, the Madisons, the John Adams.
[03:18:45.245 --> 03:18:48.647]  This is just a continuation of what our founding fathers said.
[03:18:48.647 --> 03:18:52.809]  No matter what the mainstream media is, no, the American public is not dumbed down.
[03:18:53.189 --> 03:18:53.529]  But I'm not...
[03:19:23.049 --> 03:19:24.150]  That's exactly what they think.
[03:19:24.150 --> 03:19:26.671]  I've told the President of the United States... No, Doc, I agree with you.
[03:19:26.671 --> 03:19:27.851]  We've got to go to break.
[03:19:27.851 --> 03:19:28.392]  We've got to go to break.
[03:19:28.392 --> 03:19:30.213]  There are other Americans like that.
[03:19:30.213 --> 03:19:33.434]  Just to be clear, Doc, I wasn't saying, oh, look, I'm big.
[03:19:33.434 --> 03:19:33.954]  I want to be clear.
[03:19:33.954 --> 03:19:35.795]  You don't understand what you're saying.
[03:19:35.795 --> 03:19:39.317]  The average person... You're fighting for it and people believe in you, as I do.
[03:19:39.317 --> 03:19:40.418]  Well, I mean, more than that.
[03:19:41.238 --> 03:19:43.479]  People don't know what Steve Pichinik looks like.
[03:19:43.479 --> 03:19:46.521]  They don't know what, you know, Johnny Sixpack looks like.
[03:19:46.521 --> 03:19:51.903]  Because I am public, I get an idea of how many people are awake and angry.
[03:19:51.903 --> 03:19:52.984]  That's what I'm saying.
[03:19:52.984 --> 03:19:58.467]  Most people don't, don't, aren't in that position to really get the real gauge.
[03:19:58.467 --> 03:20:01.108]  And I'm telling you folks, it is exploding!
[03:20:01.368 --> 03:20:04.349]  It could never happen in America, but it's happening right now.
[03:20:04.349 --> 03:20:07.990]  Gas prices are exploding past the incomes of millions of families.
[03:20:07.990 --> 03:20:14.591]  As gas prices and crop failures push high food costs, you can still get the best food on the planet from eFoodsDirect.com.

[03:21:01.264 --> 03:21:03.586]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[03:21:03.586 --> 03:21:05.968]  We are part of a New World Order.
[03:21:05.968 --> 03:21:09.170]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[03:21:09.170 --> 03:21:14.274]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:21:14.274 --> 03:21:18.797]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:21:18.797 --> 03:21:21.139]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:21:21.139 --> 03:21:23.681]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:21:23.681 --> 03:21:26.543]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:21:26.923 --> 03:21:34.544]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:21:34.867 --> 03:21:40.252]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:21:40.252 --> 03:21:43.095]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:21:43.095 --> 03:21:46.779]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:21:46.779 --> 03:21:47.860]  And I got news for you.
[03:21:47.860 --> 03:21:49.201]  You're everyone else.
[03:21:49.201 --> 03:21:50.702]  Invisible Empire.

[03:22:00.680 --> 03:22:04.741]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[03:22:04.741 --> 03:22:10.623]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[03:22:10.623 --> 03:22:11.724]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[03:22:11.724 --> 03:22:15.725]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[03:22:16.425 --> 03:22:30.230]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[03:22:30.230 --> 03:22:35.832]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[03:22:35.832 --> 03:22:41.735]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[03:22:45.478 --> 03:22:45.899]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[03:22:45.899 --> 03:22:47.941]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[03:22:47.941 --> 03:22:48.001]  1-800-686-2237.

[03:23:01.803 --> 03:23:04.606]  He doesn't fall asleep at his desk like he used to.
[03:23:04.606 --> 03:23:07.329]  He no longer drinks those energy drinks all day.
[03:23:07.329 --> 03:23:08.891]  He used to be gloomy.
[03:23:08.891 --> 03:23:09.952]  Now he's upbeat.
[03:23:09.952 --> 03:23:12.075]  He obviously has lost weight.
[03:23:12.075 --> 03:23:15.699]  He's now drinking Moringa in the Morning from BigJoe.us.
[03:23:16.179 --> 03:23:26.127]  Moringa is a delicious, all-organic, 100% bioavailable blend from the Miracle Moringa Tree, considered by many to be the most nutrient-rich plant ever discovered.
[03:23:26.127 --> 03:23:32.112]  Moringa in the morning will suppress cravings for junk food and energy drinks, and make you feel like a kid again.
[03:23:32.512 --> 03:23:34.073]  Drink Moringa in the Morning.
[03:23:34.073 --> 03:23:36.494]  Available from BigJoe.us.
[03:23:36.494 --> 03:23:40.235]  That's B-I-G-J-O-E dot US.
[03:23:40.235 --> 03:23:44.017]  Vibrant Health is just a click or call away at BigJoe.us or 800-503-0515.
[03:23:44.017 --> 03:23:44.077]  800-503-0515.
[03:23:44.077 --> 03:23:44.377]  That's 800-503-0515.
[03:23:44.377 --> 03:23:45.878]  Drink Moringa in the Morning.
[03:24:21.531 --> 03:24:28.976]  Forty after we're going to premiere here on air, Obama bombshell, birth certificate, a forgery.
[03:24:28.976 --> 03:24:30.217]  We have gone over it.
[03:24:30.217 --> 03:24:31.878]  It's undoubtedly a forgery.
[03:24:31.878 --> 03:24:34.980]  And we break that down.
[03:24:34.980 --> 03:24:36.942]  Dr. Corsi is coming out.
[03:24:36.942 --> 03:24:38.583]  He's always very careful.
[03:24:38.583 --> 03:24:39.643]  They've done an analysis.
[03:24:39.643 --> 03:24:40.844]  He's going to release it tomorrow.
[03:24:40.844 --> 03:24:41.585]  It is fake.
[03:24:42.891 --> 03:24:43.091]  I don't
[03:25:03.840 --> 03:25:06.521]  And then it's high-res where they've changed things.
[03:25:06.521 --> 03:25:09.301]  The typewriter font is generated by a computer.
[03:25:09.301 --> 03:25:11.742]  It's called Caring.
[03:25:11.742 --> 03:25:12.882]  That's confirmed.
[03:25:12.882 --> 03:25:14.202]  Just across the board.
[03:25:14.202 --> 03:25:26.645]  And also you can tell that it's a computer because you have typewriter typing where you blow it up and it's the exact same letter even down to the pixel.
[03:25:27.881 --> 03:25:45.191]  Now understand, like a snowflake or a fingerprint, every typewriter strike is unique because the way it hits the ribbon, the way it slams down around the edges, creates the microscopic fingerprint of that unique strike, depending on how hard you pushed and how it struck and how the paper was loaded.
[03:25:45.191 --> 03:25:46.612]  The thing is a stinking fake.
[03:25:47.452 --> 03:25:54.543]  We're going to finish up with the Awakening that's happening, the positive news we talked about during the break, and then finish up with Chris, Michael, Mark, Bob, and Brett.
[03:25:54.543 --> 03:25:55.664]  We've got to get to those callers.
[03:25:55.664 --> 03:25:56.986]  We're so honored to have you.
[03:25:56.986 --> 03:25:58.889]  StevePachinick.com is a great site.
[03:25:58.889 --> 03:26:01.994]  Folks can find out more about all your work there, or so much of your work there.
[03:26:03.295 --> 03:26:10.879]  I know you probably haven't fully looked into this, or you may have, you may not want to speak to it, but we've looked at it, Corsi's looked at it, there's no doubt it's fake.
[03:26:10.879 --> 03:26:13.360]  Why would they put out such a ridiculous fake?
[03:26:13.360 --> 03:26:16.022]  Do they want to make this a diversionary issue?
[03:26:16.022 --> 03:26:17.442]  Or are they that shoddy?
[03:26:17.442 --> 03:26:18.303]  Or do you think it's real?
[03:26:20.451 --> 03:26:23.912]  I don't think the birth certificate, I think it's a total distraction.
[03:26:23.912 --> 03:26:32.594]  Let's go back to a statement that I made about a week ago when I said my mother had been a major CIA operative in the 1960s.
[03:26:32.594 --> 03:26:43.197]  A single white female going into a Muslim country like Indonesia who had a PhD in a very sophisticated subjects of anthropology
[03:26:46.154 --> 03:26:46.354]  I don't
[03:27:01.940 --> 03:27:02.460]  I think so.
[03:27:27.078 --> 03:27:37.666]  So that's why they're covering up, is to cover up the intelligence agency family, and there's even more than just those involved, as Wayne Matson and others have documented.
[03:27:37.666 --> 03:27:39.028]  Why are they covering that up?
[03:27:39.028 --> 03:27:41.590]  So there's definitely a cover-up, but you're right.
[03:27:41.590 --> 03:27:46.734]  If he's born out of the country in a CIA, then still he's an American citizen.
[03:27:47.674 --> 03:27:50.816]  Yeah, I mean, whether he's American or not is not the issue.
[03:27:50.816 --> 03:28:08.448]  The issue is why is the intelligence narrative so distractive, and why was it imposed again on the American public in a way that very few people really knew who Obama was other than Chicago, and that he came out of nowhere, which wasn't exactly true.
[03:28:08.448 --> 03:28:12.351]  There's a CIA narrative that goes way back from the 1960s.
[03:28:12.351 --> 03:28:16.734]  It comes now, and once again, as I said, the intelligence narrative is not good.
[03:28:17.174 --> 03:28:22.540]  As it was not good in 9-11, and it was not good with Osama Bin Laden's death.
[03:28:22.540 --> 03:28:24.863]  This has nothing to do with conspiracy.
[03:28:24.863 --> 03:28:26.905]  You could look at the NSA records.
[03:28:26.905 --> 03:28:30.049]  She's on record for having been in the CIA.
[03:28:30.049 --> 03:28:32.672]  You can look at the CIA documents.
[03:28:33.132 --> 03:28:34.313]  I mean, this is absurd.
[03:28:34.313 --> 03:28:38.817]  Basically, you have a family who work for the CIA, which is legitimate.
[03:28:38.817 --> 03:28:52.348]  I mean, the CIA should be very proud of this, that in the 1960s they were able to recruit young, single women to work in the areas of expertise in dealing with Russians who were involved in the overthrow of a coup so hard.
[03:28:53.949 --> 03:29:09.078]  Why they have to impose that narrative on the American public again, 30 years later and 40 years later, bespeaks the fact that the CIA may be out of control, and the CIA is no longer relevant to either foreign affairs or domestic affairs.
[03:29:09.078 --> 03:29:12.860]  But Doc, I understand, Doc, I understand.
[03:29:12.860 --> 03:29:16.342]  And hold the Subcommittee on Intelligence accountable.
[03:29:16.342 --> 03:29:20.464]  Mr. Berman, who works in the House Intelligence Committee, should answer these questions.
[03:29:20.464 --> 03:29:21.405]  I know, but I'm asking you.
[03:29:22.565 --> 03:29:24.066]  Briefly, we're going to break.
[03:29:24.066 --> 03:29:26.769]  Why would they put out a fake one?
[03:29:26.769 --> 03:29:30.872]  Because, I don't know, because the narrative does not work.
[03:29:30.872 --> 03:29:32.173]  It is a disaster.
[03:29:32.173 --> 03:29:34.194]  They have messed up from the beginning.
[03:29:34.194 --> 03:29:38.057]  Again, it's the Osama Bin Laden, but put on Obama.
[03:29:38.057 --> 03:29:40.399]  The narratives are not working anymore.
[03:29:40.399 --> 03:29:43.861]  The public is too sophisticated.
[03:29:43.861 --> 03:29:44.662]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:44.662 --> 03:29:49.065]  We're going to jam in calls, one minute per caller, because we've got to get to this birth certificate video.
[03:29:49.065 --> 03:29:49.586]  Stay with us.
[03:29:51.584 --> 03:29:55.505]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.505 --> 03:30:01.448]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.448 --> 03:30:02.748]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:30:02.748 --> 03:30:08.330]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:30:08.330 --> 03:30:13.352]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:30:13.352 --> 03:30:18.394]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[03:30:18.914 --> 03:30:24.140]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:30:24.140 --> 03:30:31.268]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[03:30:31.268 --> 03:30:32.389]  And here's the best part.
[03:30:32.389 --> 03:30:38.756]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[03:30:39.056 --> 03:30:42.258]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[03:30:42.258 --> 03:30:44.459]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[03:30:44.459 --> 03:30:47.720]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:30:47.720 --> 03:30:50.481]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:30:50.481 --> 03:30:58.125]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:30:58.125 --> 03:31:01.266]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[03:31:01.266 --> 03:31:02.727]  America, you've been warned.
[03:31:10.239 --> 03:31:13.620]  We've told you about the video that details this shocking prediction.
[03:31:13.620 --> 03:31:17.301]  So far, over 6 million people have watched this free video online.
[03:31:17.301 --> 03:31:18.102]  Have you?
[03:31:18.102 --> 03:31:29.406]  Again, this big event has nothing to do with war or the stock market, yet it could change everything about your normal way of life, the way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your family.
[03:31:29.406 --> 03:31:30.586]  Could this really happen?
[03:31:30.586 --> 03:31:34.568]  Well, the man who created this video has been right about many predictions in his career.
[03:31:34.568 --> 03:31:38.729]  He was among the first to predict the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's
[03:31:43.097 --> 03:31:43.417]  We're good.
[03:32:00.953 --> 03:32:04.475]  There's a man named Dr. Wallach who is anything but your typical doctor.
[03:32:04.475 --> 03:32:15.260]  Both a veterinarian and naturopathic physician, Doc asks, why does the United States spend more money on health care by far and still rank 50th in health and longevity worldwide?
[03:32:15.260 --> 03:32:24.385]  He believes that people should empower themselves with a basic understanding of nutrition, taking charge of their life, and attain optimal health and longevity through nutrition.
[03:32:24.825 --> 03:32:28.067]  Not by toxic prescription drugs leading to side effects.
[03:32:28.067 --> 03:32:30.048]  This is clearly a deadly recipe.
[03:32:30.048 --> 03:32:39.612]  The good news is Doc Wallach's message is resonating with an increasing number of Americans who are waking up to all the big government and big pharma manipulation of our healthcare system.
[03:32:39.612 --> 03:32:46.896]  I like what Doc Wallach is saying and doing to enlighten people about healthcare and have joined forces to help this tireless crusader spread his message.
[03:32:47.356 --> 03:32:52.238]  Visit Infowarsteam.com and listen to Dr. Wallach's Deadly Recipes lecture.
[03:32:52.238 --> 03:32:56.180]  It makes a lot of sense, and I want you to join our Infowars team.
[03:32:56.180 --> 03:32:58.381]  Go to Infowarsteam.com.
[03:32:58.381 --> 03:33:02.222]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[03:33:02.222 --> 03:33:08.045]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:08.045 --> 03:33:10.266]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:33:13.905 --> 03:33:15.086]  Alright, final segment.
[03:33:15.086 --> 03:33:17.428]  Just got a few minutes left with Dr. Steve Pachinik.
[03:33:17.428 --> 03:33:21.091]  I want to jam in a few of your calls.
[03:33:21.091 --> 03:33:25.574]  We'll definitely have him back up and maybe just do calls because I love the questions listeners bring up.
[03:33:25.574 --> 03:33:30.998]  Chris, Michael, Mark, Bob, Brett, please just have a quick question or comment for Dr. Pachinik.
[03:33:30.998 --> 03:33:32.559]  He's got to have quick answers.
[03:33:32.559 --> 03:33:34.341]  Chris, in New Hampshire, you're on the air.
[03:33:35.876 --> 03:33:37.357]  Hi, Dr. Pruchenick.
[03:33:37.357 --> 03:33:48.563]  For years, the thing I couldn't understand about the whole 9-11 fiasco was how nobody from within government had the guts to stand up and come forward.
[03:33:48.563 --> 03:33:57.428]  And obviously, things have changed, and you have restored a little bit of faith in my government, for me at least.
[03:33:57.428 --> 03:34:00.249]  By the way, there have been a lot of whistleblowers from 9-11.
[03:34:00.249 --> 03:34:04.712]  Sybil Edmonds, Colonel Schaefer, the list goes on for hours, but go ahead.
[03:34:06.409 --> 03:34:15.996]  I have been on the phone, sir, all day with the Attorney General, State Attorney General from New York and their offices and their officers and investigators.
[03:34:15.996 --> 03:34:26.083]  I've also been on the phone with the District Attorney in Lower Manhattan who would have jurisdiction over a crime of this magnitude, obviously.
[03:34:26.083 --> 03:34:31.027]  Did you know, sir, that the District Attorney in Lower Manhattan is Cyrus Vance Jr.? ?
[03:34:32.429 --> 03:34:33.269]  Yes.
[03:34:33.269 --> 03:34:34.029]  I knew that.
[03:34:34.029 --> 03:34:34.950]  That's the son.
[03:34:34.950 --> 03:34:38.471]  I believe it's the son of the man I worked with, Cyrus Vance.
[03:34:38.471 --> 03:34:39.791]  Here's the headline.
[03:34:39.791 --> 03:34:40.231]  D.A.
[03:34:40.231 --> 03:34:45.512]  Vance announces arraignment of Dominic Strauss Converse Sexual Assault on Hotel Cyrus Vance Jr.
[03:34:45.512 --> 03:34:47.553]  That's correct.
[03:34:47.553 --> 03:34:51.874]  Well, they are very, very eager to hear from you.
[03:34:51.874 --> 03:34:57.716]  They want to speak with you regarding empaneling a grand jury investigation to hear what you have said.
[03:34:57.716 --> 03:34:59.456]  I have their phone number here if you'd like it.
[03:35:00.936 --> 03:35:04.919]  Not at this particular point, but if they're happy to reach me, they know where to get me.
[03:35:04.919 --> 03:35:22.253]  Okay, I have given them all your contact information, and actually, if you guys want to hear the interview that I conducted with their senior lead investigator at the district attorney's office, you can find that at 911dude.net.
[03:35:22.253 --> 03:35:23.974]  Alright, we'll look it up.
[03:35:23.974 --> 03:35:24.395]  Thank you.
[03:35:24.395 --> 03:35:25.416]  Thank you so much.
[03:35:25.416 --> 03:35:26.777]  I appreciate it.
[03:35:26.777 --> 03:35:28.458]  I appreciate the people in New Hampshire.
[03:35:28.979 --> 03:35:35.484]  I'd like to offer a brief observation and a synopsis of a solution that I've spent the last year of my life working on.
[03:35:55.151 --> 03:35:57.552]  And get, uh, Steve's, uh, informed comments on that.
[03:35:57.552 --> 03:35:59.113]  Okay, real fast, go ahead.
[03:35:59.113 --> 03:35:59.873]  Okay.
[03:35:59.873 --> 03:36:01.214]  Well, the observation is this.
[03:36:01.214 --> 03:36:10.178]  Uh, currently law enforcement, they, uh, they use rewards for the arrest of, uh, and conviction of criminals.
[03:36:10.178 --> 03:36:11.878]  And, uh, and it works very well.
[03:36:11.878 --> 03:36:15.380]  It doesn't take a whole lot of money to get really good results.
[03:36:15.380 --> 03:36:20.062]  But oddly enough, you see all the criminals that you've been talking about today on today's show.
[03:36:20.986 --> 03:36:25.090]  These law enforcement agencies, they're not offering rewards for their arrests.
[03:36:25.090 --> 03:36:28.032]  That's a very interesting observation.
[03:36:28.032 --> 03:36:33.737]  And because of this, I've spent the last year of my life working on a website called ArrestWanted.com
[03:36:35.254 --> 03:36:39.897]  And this is a website where Americans can directly contribute.
[03:36:39.897 --> 03:36:40.978]  No, I've seen it, sir.
[03:36:40.978 --> 03:36:42.138]  You've sent it to us.
[03:36:42.138 --> 03:36:44.600]  We put money in and there's an award for somebody.
[03:36:44.600 --> 03:36:48.863]  That could be a consumer putting bounties out, extrajudicial bounties out.
[03:36:48.863 --> 03:36:50.684]  And I appreciate your call.
[03:36:50.684 --> 03:36:53.686]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mark in Michigan.
[03:36:53.686 --> 03:36:54.546]  Mark, you're on the air.
[03:36:54.546 --> 03:36:55.607]  Go ahead, quickly, please.
[03:36:56.167 --> 03:36:58.268]  Hello Alex, Dr. Buchanek.
[03:36:58.268 --> 03:36:58.949]  Hi.
[03:36:58.949 --> 03:37:11.436]  I was on, I believe it was Dredge Report a couple days ago, and they were talking about the ten people that have turned up dead with regards to the BP Gulf oil spill.
[03:37:11.436 --> 03:37:24.544]  And also that the most experienced deep water drilling manager at the time was removed from the platform just before they came to the most critical stage, and they brought in a rookie to take charge of the platform.
[03:37:25.857 --> 03:37:32.619]  And then all of a sudden, you know, we have this bill and Obama shuts down all drilling out in the Gulf.
[03:37:32.619 --> 03:37:38.480]  And shortly thereafter, he announces how he wants to be the best customer for Brazil.
[03:37:38.480 --> 03:37:48.703]  And then it comes out, actually, believe it or not, on VAC, how George Soros owns 25 million shares of this oil company down there in Brazil.
[03:37:48.703 --> 03:37:52.804]  And it just seems like the same modus operandi that we're seeing with 9-11 and
[03:37:55.010 --> 03:38:00.371]  How the government's working and big money working against us and our nation.
[03:38:00.371 --> 03:38:04.592]  Well, I can tell you BP is not a very effective organization.
[03:38:04.592 --> 03:38:08.573]  Its shareholders are already questioning the management CEO.
[03:38:08.573 --> 03:38:11.133]  He just messed up a major deal with Russia.
[03:38:11.133 --> 03:38:16.134]  So BP is on notice for the stockholders that they're not happy.
[03:38:16.134 --> 03:38:19.735]  So whatever else you could say, this is not a very effective company.
[03:38:20.802 --> 03:38:22.602]  We've only got a minute or two left.
[03:38:22.602 --> 03:38:24.483]  Bob in California.
[03:38:24.483 --> 03:38:25.103]  You're on the air.
[03:38:25.103 --> 03:38:26.944]  Go ahead, Bob.
[03:38:26.944 --> 03:38:27.444]  Hey, Alex.
[03:38:27.444 --> 03:38:33.545]  Thank you for the opportunity to speak with someone of Dr. Potenic's reputation and character.
[03:38:33.545 --> 03:38:36.986]  My question is this for Dr. Potenic.
[03:38:36.986 --> 03:38:44.428]  Several years ago, I had the opportunity to read a Chinese document on unrestricted warfare.
[03:38:44.428 --> 03:38:48.509]  My question is, if he had a chance to read that document, is it still valid today?
[03:38:50.135 --> 03:38:53.418]  I think I know the document you're referring to.
[03:38:53.418 --> 03:39:06.752]  Basically, the Chinese warfare doctrine states that they will do a low-tech war and that they will not allow any incursion into their sphere of influence, which they've determined to be quite extensive, in South China Sea.
[03:39:06.752 --> 03:39:10.776]  And they've had real problems now with Vietnam, the Philippines, and the Spratly
[03:39:10.776 --> 03:39:11.516]  We're good to go.
[03:39:30.120 --> 03:39:31.421]  All right, thank you so much.
[03:39:31.421 --> 03:39:32.282]  We're just out of time.
[03:39:32.282 --> 03:39:34.183]  Sorry to Brett and others.
[03:39:34.183 --> 03:39:35.945]  StevePachinick.com.
[03:39:35.945 --> 03:39:38.186]  Doc, you've been very nice to spend time with us.
[03:39:38.186 --> 03:39:39.948]  A very interesting perspective on the world.
[03:39:39.948 --> 03:39:43.390]  We appreciate your courage coming here on the broadcast.
[03:39:43.390 --> 03:39:49.295]  And I'm going to go to this video, Obama bombshell, here in just a moment.
[03:39:49.295 --> 03:39:52.778]  But I'd like you to stay on hold so I can say bye to you once we go off air.
[03:39:52.778 --> 03:39:54.959]  But thank you for spending time with us.
[03:39:54.959 --> 03:39:55.960]  It's an honor.
[03:39:55.960 --> 03:39:56.861]  It's a pleasure.
[03:39:59.787 --> 03:40:04.330]  Please rest assured that you will be able to have an impact on our government.
[03:40:04.330 --> 03:40:06.512]  Thanks to Alex and other people.
[03:40:06.512 --> 03:40:12.056]  It has something to do with me, but we have an amazing public in America and we can't be fooled repeatedly.
[03:40:18.279 --> 03:40:18.860]  Absolutely.
[03:40:18.860 --> 03:40:21.641]  Dr. Pachinik, again, thank you for joining us.
[03:40:21.641 --> 03:40:23.783]  Folks, we're about to go to the premiere of this video.
[03:40:23.783 --> 03:40:27.985]  It'll go up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com in a few minutes.
[03:40:27.985 --> 03:40:29.246]  Help get it out to everybody.
[03:40:29.246 --> 03:40:34.850]  Here's the premiere of the streaming video at PrisonPlanet.tv and the audio for radio listeners.
[03:40:34.850 --> 03:40:38.152]  Obama bombshell, new birth certificate, a forgery.
[03:40:38.992 --> 03:40:44.596]  I know that there's going to be a segment of people for which, no matter what we put out, this issue will not be put to rest.
[03:41:09.778 --> 03:41:16.440]  But I'm speaking to the vast majority of the American people, as well as to the press.
[03:41:16.440 --> 03:41:20.061]  We do not have time for this kind of silliness.
[03:41:20.061 --> 03:41:21.602]  We got better stuff to do.
[03:41:21.602 --> 03:41:29.204]  I've got some very important breaking news for you dealing with the whole President Obama birth certificate issue.
[03:41:29.204 --> 03:41:32.666]  But before I get into the latest developments, I want to make it clear.
[03:41:32.666 --> 03:41:36.467]  In the last three years, I did not embrace the birther issue.
[03:41:37.407 --> 03:41:39.068]  I'm somebody that questions government.
[03:41:39.068 --> 03:41:40.950]  Look at Nixon lying to us.
[03:41:40.950 --> 03:41:49.596]  Look at Clinton lying about Monica Lewinsky and then cruise-missiling an African aspirin factory as a political diversion.
[03:41:49.596 --> 03:41:56.201]  Look at George W. Bush premeditatedly lying about WMDs in Iraq and being caught.
[03:41:56.201 --> 03:41:57.923]  So it's good to question.
[03:41:57.923 --> 03:42:00.124]  But there's all these real issues.
[03:42:01.045 --> 03:42:03.947]  Out there that Obama needs to be confronted on.
[03:42:03.947 --> 03:42:10.170]  Continuing torture, wars, giving health care waivers to his friends that don't have to get the insurance.
[03:42:10.170 --> 03:42:12.231]  So many things.
[03:42:12.231 --> 03:42:14.312]  And I've wanted to focus on that.
[03:42:14.312 --> 03:42:22.196]  So when this whole birth certificate issue first got raised three years ago, I thought it was a red herring, a distraction from issues.
[03:42:22.196 --> 03:42:25.118]  But then a year or so later when they released
[03:42:26.789 --> 03:42:38.057]  This government receipt of a birth certificate and told everybody that this was the original and that nothing else existed and you were a crazy conspiracy theorist if you believe that a long form existed.
[03:42:38.057 --> 03:42:41.419]  Looney Tunes and this craziness has spread to Capitol Hill for real now.
[03:42:41.419 --> 03:42:43.981]  Everybody's getting on the zoo bus when it comes to this question.
[03:42:43.981 --> 03:42:51.867]  Nutty questions about the president's birth certificate are being fueled by concerned talk show hosts like Rushbow himself and of course some others like Lou Dobbs.
[03:42:51.867 --> 03:42:54.368]  I'm showing you his birth certificate.
[03:42:54.368 --> 03:42:55.169]  It's on the screen now.
[03:42:55.169 --> 03:42:55.990]  Take a close look.
[03:42:56.801 --> 03:42:58.484]  I knew that that was a lie.
[03:42:58.484 --> 03:43:06.155]  I knew that I had the original blueprint with my feet prints and my weight and the doctor's signature on it.
[03:43:07.282 --> 03:43:12.103]  I knew that that was a lie, but still I said, eh, who knows.
[03:43:12.103 --> 03:43:19.966]  Then the White House spent over $2 million fighting lawsuits that were trying to get his long-form birth certificate released.
[03:43:19.966 --> 03:43:29.268]  Then the governor-elect, Abercrombie, of Hawaii said in January, as he was going into office, that he would get the original birth certificate and release it.
[03:43:29.268 --> 03:43:34.150]  Then he told some of the newspapers there in Hawaii that he'd looked for it and couldn't find it.
[03:43:35.011 --> 03:43:37.972]  And I started saying to myself, man, this is really weird.
[03:43:37.972 --> 03:43:44.536]  Even if he couldn't find it, he's a Democrat, why would he say that he couldn't find it?
[03:43:44.536 --> 03:43:46.196]  It got stranger and stranger.
[03:43:46.196 --> 03:43:50.739]  Then about a month before this book was set to come out, Where's the Birth Certificate?
[03:43:50.739 --> 03:43:59.663]  by Dr. Jerome R. Corsi, Obama out of the blue comes out and gives a press conference and laughs about it and says, here is my original birth certificate.
[03:44:00.103 --> 03:44:01.284]  Here's the long form.
[03:44:01.284 --> 03:44:02.785]  I'm like, wow, they're being honest.
[03:44:02.785 --> 03:44:03.726]  Long form.
[03:44:03.726 --> 03:44:09.170]  So I said, good, we can put this red herring to bed and now focus on the real issues.
[03:44:09.170 --> 03:44:17.496]  Like Obama going along with the Republicans in the continued banker bailout of tens of trillions of dollars.
[03:44:17.496 --> 03:44:20.638]  But then our phones started ringing and we saw major
[03:44:21.943 --> 03:44:29.370]  Photoshop blogs that weren't even political, looking at this and pointing out that when you put it in Illustrator, you could break it into layers.
[03:44:29.370 --> 03:44:31.572]  And that's normal.
[03:44:31.572 --> 03:44:33.814]  Except that normally it only shows two layers.
[03:44:33.814 --> 03:44:36.336]  There were a whole bunch of different layers.
[03:44:36.336 --> 03:44:44.424]  And different areas were more pixelated and were lower res than other areas, showing clearly that it had been altered and photoshopped.
[03:44:45.899 --> 03:44:59.282]  Then I began to notice that this was a typewriter, but if you blew up letters printed by the typewriter, stamped by the typewriter, that they were exact copies of each other, which is impossible.
[03:44:59.282 --> 03:45:11.284]  A typewriter is a key striking the ink ribbon, and depending on how hard you hit it or how it strikes the paper, each one is different, like a fingerprint or a snowflake.
[03:45:11.664 --> 03:45:16.326]  Then I noticed that in the same type there were different letters from a different font.
[03:45:16.326 --> 03:45:20.648]  You've got the code number out of sequence and out of date.
[03:45:20.648 --> 03:45:26.411]  It was as if this had been forged on purpose to make this the issue.
[03:45:26.411 --> 03:45:34.315]  And I pointed that out in our YouTube video that's gotten over 600,000 views on the subject that this is a shoddy fraud.
[03:45:34.955 --> 03:45:41.878]  It's well known that they have federal agencies, like the CIA and others, that are masters at making near-perfect forgeries.
[03:45:41.878 --> 03:45:44.399]  So why was this so shoddy?
[03:45:44.399 --> 03:45:57.605]  And why would Obama counter Donald Trump going around talking about the birth certificate issue and Dr. Corsi's book that was about to come out if it was a fraud, if it was a joke, if it didn't matter?
[03:45:57.605 --> 03:46:01.227]  And as soon as we looked at this document, it was clearly
[03:46:02.463 --> 03:46:03.023]  A fraud.
[03:46:03.023 --> 03:46:04.424]  Clearly a forgery.
[03:46:04.424 --> 03:46:06.746]  And we asked ourselves, why?
[03:46:06.746 --> 03:46:09.848]  So understand, ladies and gentlemen, I'm nonpartisan.
[03:46:09.848 --> 03:46:11.149]  I'm a constitutionalist.
[03:46:11.149 --> 03:46:11.990]  I'm a libertarian.
[03:46:11.990 --> 03:46:14.351]  I don't like the Republicans or the Democrats.
[03:46:14.351 --> 03:46:15.872]  And I'm on record for that.
[03:46:15.872 --> 03:46:18.775]  I simply look at things and break down the facts.
[03:46:18.775 --> 03:46:24.398]  Now, the new information enters the story, and here's where it gets crazy.
[03:46:24.398 --> 03:46:24.859]  Today,
[03:46:26.869 --> 03:46:27.069]  Yes.
[03:46:43.135 --> 03:47:00.222]  Saying that it was being recalled 200,000 copies that Joseph Farah, the owner of WorldNetDaily, had chewed out Jerome Corsi and that he was offering for people to get their money back and for publishers to send it in.
[03:47:00.222 --> 03:47:03.764]  This was not done by a satire writer.
[03:47:03.764 --> 03:47:05.565]  This was not done by somebody who
[03:47:07.106 --> 03:47:10.431]  Uh, noted on the article that it was satire.
[03:47:10.431 --> 03:47:18.582]  Once the story launched and Joseph Farah said he was going to sue, or was thinking about suing, then they added a little blurb at the bottom saying, hey this is satire.
[03:47:19.861 --> 03:47:22.083]  Now, this does a lot of things here.
[03:47:22.083 --> 03:47:24.124]  It shows the White House is desperate.
[03:47:24.124 --> 03:47:42.338]  This came out on the same day that the White House told ABC News and others that they're going to run, not on Obama's record, of basically being a Bush clone, minus different rhetoric, and that they were going to put out t-shirts about the birth certificate and make it a big joke because they don't want to focus on the issues.
[03:47:42.338 --> 03:47:46.101]  So clearly, in a concerted effort, they're still afraid of this book.
[03:47:46.761 --> 03:47:50.324]  They come out and create a hoax saying it's been discredited.
[03:47:50.324 --> 03:47:52.346]  The publisher has removed it.
[03:47:52.346 --> 03:47:54.889]  He's taking it off bookstore shelves.
[03:47:54.889 --> 03:48:01.855]  You can get your money back trying to create a grassroots buzz for people to try to get their money back.
[03:48:01.855 --> 03:48:03.917]  I mean, this is economic espionage.
[03:48:03.917 --> 03:48:05.178]  This this is
[03:48:06.660 --> 03:48:18.847]  And if the White House has already discredited all this, and this is their new campaign slogan, why then would they engage in this type of just unbelievably dirty trick?
[03:48:18.847 --> 03:48:20.729]  And it's because they are scared.
[03:48:20.729 --> 03:48:23.550]  Well, it now turns out that Dr. Jerome Corsi
[03:48:24.531 --> 03:48:43.181]  He's going to be coming out in the next few days, including on my radio show this Friday, and breaking down their forensic experts that have proven that basically this is a composite of multiple real Hawaiian birth certificates from 1961.
[03:48:43.181 --> 03:48:47.144]  And that is what we had said a month ago when all this first broke.
[03:48:47.984 --> 03:48:51.205]  Again, at first on air, I was like, well, okay, looks like it's real.
[03:48:51.205 --> 03:48:52.045]  We'll have to check it.
[03:48:52.045 --> 03:48:53.106]  But there you go.
[03:48:53.106 --> 03:48:55.026]  Let's move on to real issues.
[03:48:55.026 --> 03:48:58.527]  And then we look at it and it's like, oh, my God, this thing is fake on purpose.
[03:48:58.527 --> 03:49:11.992]  So either it's they didn't want to use an agency and they use Bob down the hall to do it because they were afraid of leaks to make a good fake, a good forgery, or they are simply engaging in a PSYOP trying to make
[03:49:12.552 --> 03:49:27.021]  The whole debate continue to be about the birth certificate because it's balkanizing and divides the people along an issue that doesn't deal with the banker bailouts and the corruption and all the things that both major parties are involved in.
[03:49:27.021 --> 03:49:29.623]  But either way you slice it, this thing has been altered.
[03:49:29.623 --> 03:49:32.365]  I mean, in more than 50 ways.
[03:49:32.365 --> 03:49:33.245]  And that's conservative.
[03:49:33.245 --> 03:49:38.529]  Then you've got the White House releasing the latest final birth certificate.
[03:49:39.789 --> 03:49:49.597]  And it's got this green hash background that is not on the copy that the Associated Press reportedly went to the stacks and got.
[03:49:49.597 --> 03:49:59.084]  And Dr. Corsi says he's going to produce evidence showing that they basically have gone in and inserted this into the book.
[03:49:59.084 --> 03:50:03.588]  The same book in the archives that Governor Abercrombie couldn't find.
[03:50:03.588 --> 03:50:06.250]  And then you have the fact that this doesn't even have the official seal.
[03:50:06.630 --> 03:50:07.311]  None of them do.
[03:50:07.311 --> 03:50:10.155]  Not the first AP, not the one the White House released.
[03:50:10.155 --> 03:50:11.917]  And again, I could go on for hours.
[03:50:11.917 --> 03:50:13.299]  This is a giant mystery.
[03:50:13.299 --> 03:50:14.841]  A giant whodunit.
[03:50:14.841 --> 03:50:18.006]  I don't know why they've put out this fake birth certificate.
[03:50:18.006 --> 03:50:20.129]  He may have been born in Hawaii.
[03:50:20.129 --> 03:50:22.292]  I would rather debate Obama on the issues.
[03:50:23.473 --> 03:50:27.056]  Just like I'm against most of the Republican people that are running.
[03:50:27.056 --> 03:50:30.198]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's up to all of us to figure out exactly what's happening.
[03:50:30.198 --> 03:50:35.322]  But the norm for presidents of these corrupt administrations is to lie to us.
[03:50:35.322 --> 03:50:44.288]  And we have Obama come out and tell us that this is his birth certificate when they told us two and a half years ago that the last copy was the official birth certificate and nothing else existed.
[03:50:44.288 --> 03:50:52.014]  We've been lied to so much by government that we would be idiots to just believe what they told us because they told us.
[03:50:53.199 --> 03:50:56.286]  It is common sense to question these people.
[03:50:56.286 --> 03:51:00.134]  And I wish we could end this issue, but it's only getting deeper.
[03:51:00.134 --> 03:51:01.297]  And maybe that's what they want.
