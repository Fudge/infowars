[00:00:01.476 --> 00:00:04.277]  Political taggers have struck Austin, Texas.
[00:00:04.617 --> 00:00:13.318]  The billboard behind me is an advertisement for a motivational seminar featuring war criminals to be held today at the Austin Convention Center.
[00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:24.341]  The graffiti on this sign presents strong political points that are generally unknown to the public because the establishment media has hidden the truth or at best has minimized it.
[00:00:24.941 --> 00:00:30.102]  Now we're going to get some people's reaction to the billboard and then we're heading to the convention center to get motivated.
[00:00:30.871 --> 00:00:32.714]  Well, it's a pretty brave person got up there.
[00:00:32.774 --> 00:00:40.949]  I think it's I think it's opening their minds and I think it's a good thing that people are awakening to what's really going on in America.
[00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.785]  I believe the yellow cake refers to the uranium, radioactive material that Saddam Hussein was doing.
[00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:51.049]  Supposedly tried to purchase from Niger, which ended up being totally false.
[00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:57.895]  I believe that was the yellow cake coming out of Niger that supposedly Saddam Hussein purchased, which was found not to be true.
[00:00:57.955 --> 00:01:03.340]  There were no weapons of mass destruction, so I would ask Colin Powell, where are the weapons of mass destruction?
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.743]  If you got to ask, let's say, a Colin Powell question, what would you ask him?
[00:01:07.228 --> 00:01:13.610]  I'd ask him if he was against the Bush administration with its war mongering, how he feels about Obama.
[00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:19.311]  You know, if I had a chance to ask Colin Pollack a question, I'd probably ask him, what's it like being in the Oval Office?
[00:01:19.851 --> 00:01:27.353]  I think to be able to just have that sense of presence and being in a place that's so powerful but yet historic, it's just, it's astronomical.
[00:01:28.089 --> 00:01:34.911]  I think we all make mistakes, and certainly if we don't forgive others for those mistakes, we can't expect to be forgiving ourselves for them.
[00:01:34.931 --> 00:01:37.272]  It's a pretty big mistake, you know, going to war.
[00:01:37.292 --> 00:01:39.152]  I mean, you know, that's a pretty big one.
[00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:39.912]  That's true.
[00:01:39.972 --> 00:01:41.453]  Some people don't think it was a mistake.
[00:01:41.513 --> 00:01:46.074]  It might have even been intentional that he, you know, he brought in props and he actually lied.
[00:01:47.182 --> 00:01:55.189]  I can't really speak on his own motives for doing that, if he did indeed do that.
[00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:05.559]  I don't know if it's proven that he did lie, but I can say that he was a very, he's a motivational man, he's a good leader, and I think we can learn a lot from him.
[00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.662]  So he actually addressed the crowd.
[00:02:07.682 --> 00:02:08.924]  Were they pretty responsive?
[00:02:08.984 --> 00:02:11.207]  And he talked about TSA pat-downs.
[00:02:11.267 --> 00:02:19.158]  And did he talk about expanding the TSA to include bus terminals, subway stations, or was it just airports?
[00:02:19.508 --> 00:02:29.835]  No, he was just basically talking about the general experience in the airport, and he made it humorous, which kind of disarms people and makes it less threatening.
[00:02:30.236 --> 00:02:31.636]  I quit flying because of it.
[00:02:31.997 --> 00:02:34.178]  I will not get on an airplane anymore.
[00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:39.062]  Some people think that McChrystal was responsible for exploiting Pat Tillman's murder.
[00:02:39.502 --> 00:02:41.183]  Do you buy into that, or what are your thoughts?
[00:02:41.483 --> 00:02:43.365]  If you could ask McChrystal a question, what would it be?
[00:02:44.284 --> 00:02:47.086]  I would ask him what his role was in Pat Tillman's cover-up.
[00:02:47.866 --> 00:02:49.067]  The death of the Pat Tillman cover-up.
[00:02:49.087 --> 00:02:49.888]  That's what I would ask him.
[00:02:50.308 --> 00:02:56.232]  Chris, I'd ask him if he knew anything about Tillman, you know, before he got killed.
[00:02:56.472 --> 00:02:58.954]  You know, what information passed by his desk.
[00:02:59.374 --> 00:03:10.762]  Now, this billboard was tagged on Thanksgiving, but the graffiti still remains, which means during the past few days, the people of Austin, Texas, have been subjected to a glimpse of the unvarnished truth.
[00:03:11.713 --> 00:03:14.480]  I'm Darren McBring for InfoWars Nightly News.
