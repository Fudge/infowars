[00:00:05.111 --> 00:00:05.731]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.412 --> 00:00:07.452]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.172 --> 00:00:09.313]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:10.773]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.514 --> 00:00:12.454]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.074 --> 00:00:16.656]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.256 --> 00:00:21.398]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.861]  It rarely happens.
[00:00:31.502 --> 00:00:41.971]  I have done thousands and thousands and thousands of radio broadcasts, thousands and thousands of radio interviews, hundreds and hundreds of TV interviews over the years, and I really never get butterflies.
[00:00:42.632 --> 00:00:48.137]  I never really get nervous even before speaking to a crowd of 5,000 people that's televised.
[00:00:49.798 --> 00:00:51.860]  I don't get nervous when I've been on Good Morning America.
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.042]  I don't get nervous when I'm on CNN or Fox.
[00:00:54.242 --> 00:00:56.824]  I am extremely nervous right now.
[00:00:56.844 --> 00:00:57.905]  I am extremely
[00:00:59.104 --> 00:01:28.524]  Fired up and at the same time focused because we are going to launch something today in the face of the complete criminal takeover of our society that if you decide to take action, that if you decide to give this idea power and momentum, it is going to shake the foundations of the new world order crime syndicate that we've already had such great effects against together.
[00:01:29.204 --> 00:01:37.510]  We are locked in a titanic struggle of good versus evil, of liberty versus tyranny, of freedom versus slavery and despotism.
[00:01:40.132 --> 00:01:42.114]  Congressman Ron Paul is joining us in 30 minutes.
[00:01:42.174 --> 00:01:48.699]  Then Paul Joseph Watson is going to be with us with some key announcements that we're also going to have coming up in the last hour.
[00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:49.319]  Joel Skousen.
[00:01:51.781 --> 00:01:58.486]  But last night, in the face of DHS putting out public service announcements,
[00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:07.255]  Openly telling citizens to further spy on each other, that anyone buying things with cash may be a terrorist.
[00:02:07.935 --> 00:02:20.747]  With the DHS admitting they're going to put TSA at sports stadiums and malls, which they said they'd do years ago, but now they're rolling it out, in the face of the FEMA 10 governorship expansion, the threat fusion centers.
[00:02:21.368 --> 00:02:31.175]  The states, what we told you years ago, now announcing that they're preparing to go bankrupt into federal receivership itself, into IMF, World Bank, OECD receivership.
[00:02:31.855 --> 00:02:44.605]  With all of this happening, with the Chinese visiting and saying the days of the dollar are doomed, with Henry Kissinger announcing on Charlie Rose two nights ago that the New World Order is now being born through the economic crisis they engineered,
[00:02:45.385 --> 00:02:46.386]  He left that part out, though.
[00:02:46.406 --> 00:02:47.746]  He said, through the economic crisis.
[00:02:48.387 --> 00:02:50.728]  We are at the crossroads right now.
[00:02:50.808 --> 00:03:01.034]  We've been moving into that zone for a long time, but now is the crossroads, and it's time to launch a major information warfare, peaceful resistance to this now.
[00:03:01.595 --> 00:03:10.260]  And it is important that this information I'm going to cover, when we come back from break, explodes dynamically and immediately.
[00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.500]  And that there be a chain reaction doing this.
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.701]  People are always saying, Alex, mobilize us.
[00:03:16.261 --> 00:03:18.401]  Alex, give us marching orders.
[00:03:18.641 --> 00:03:20.102]  Alex, we want to hit the streets.
[00:03:20.162 --> 00:03:23.702]  Well, I've got a peaceful program to do that.
[00:03:23.822 --> 00:03:29.103]  A double-pronged, two-pronged, pincer attack against the globalists.
[00:03:31.984 --> 00:03:39.885]  That we're going to be discussing coming up in the next segment, for the next two segments ahead of Congressman Ron Paul, scheduled to be joining us from his Lake Jackson office.
[00:03:40.981 --> 00:03:42.443]  He's got an event down there tonight, I'm told.
[00:03:43.804 --> 00:03:44.966]  This is so important.
[00:03:46.067 --> 00:03:50.853]  Evil is rising, but for any action there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[00:03:51.033 --> 00:03:53.977]  That is the law of the universe, and we must rise now.
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.783]  And really get aggressive against the globalists.
[00:03:58.863 --> 00:04:10.333]  And what we do now may take weeks, months, or even a year to unfold, just like what I launched over a year ago with the operations exposing the TSA's plan to take over society via DHS.
[00:04:10.973 --> 00:04:14.736]  How the airports are the training grounds to begin the brainwashing.
[00:04:15.077 --> 00:04:20.201]  It takes time to build movements, systematic ripples in the pond from the pebbles we throw in.
[00:04:20.541 --> 00:04:22.063]  We're going to throw a boulder in today.
[00:04:23.424 --> 00:04:35.808]  You go back over a year ago and then about nine months ago we launched two different operations exposing the fake terror, exposing the DHS and TSA is taking over and that they're training you to be a slave and have them stick their hands down your pants.
[00:04:36.148 --> 00:04:38.109]  Now look at them in retreat.
[00:04:40.769 --> 00:04:42.829]  Polls over 90% against it.
[00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.791]  A poll just out nationally in Germany.
[00:04:47.171 --> 00:04:49.412]  89.5% believe 9-11's an inside job.
[00:04:49.732 --> 00:04:51.413]  The awakening is here, but it takes time.
[00:04:51.753 --> 00:04:59.597]  But what we're about to launch, if you take action, will be the single greatest devastating blow this InfoWars operation has ever launched.
[00:05:00.424 --> 00:05:03.866]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[00:05:04.246 --> 00:05:08.308]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[00:05:08.528 --> 00:05:13.331]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[00:05:13.451 --> 00:05:18.433]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[00:05:19.174 --> 00:05:22.375]  Not worried about them moving south.
[00:05:22.415 --> 00:05:26.257]  Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[00:05:28.952 --> 00:05:33.334]  I'm looking for America.
[00:05:34.475 --> 00:05:35.956]  Wear American and be proud.
[00:05:36.116 --> 00:05:38.657]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[00:05:38.717 --> 00:05:42.919]  The land of the free and the home of the brave.
[00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.062]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[00:05:54.921 --> 00:05:59.498]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[00:06:00.148 --> 00:06:04.391]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:06:04.691 --> 00:06:04.972]  Number 1.
[00:06:05.612 --> 00:06:08.774]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:09.595]  Number 2.
[00:06:09.895 --> 00:06:14.459]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:06:14.799 --> 00:06:15.239]  It's true.
[00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:20.103]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:06:20.403 --> 00:06:20.943]  Number 3.
[00:06:21.224 --> 00:06:24.506]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:06:24.826 --> 00:06:28.489]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:06:28.709 --> 00:06:28.969]  Number 4.
[00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.872]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:06:32.272 --> 00:06:35.656]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:06:35.956 --> 00:06:36.496]  Number 5.
[00:06:36.737 --> 00:06:40.660]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.665]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:06:45.945 --> 00:06:49.970]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:51.672]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:51.892 --> 00:06:53.974]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:06:54.155 --> 00:06:56.497]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:07:00.882 --> 00:07:15.354]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:07:16.355 --> 00:07:20.018]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:21.041 --> 00:07:33.053]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:07:33.813 --> 00:07:41.080]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:07:41.761 --> 00:07:51.366]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:07:52.127 --> 00:07:55.409]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:07:56.049 --> 00:07:59.171]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:11.814]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[00:08:12.594 --> 00:08:13.635]  Thomas Jefferson.
[00:08:14.155 --> 00:08:17.816]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:22.902 --> 00:08:35.991]  January 21st, 2011, and let this be a day remembered for a long time to come that we launched Operation The Answer to 1984 is 1776, and at the heart of it is the sub-operation V for Victory.
[00:08:43.666 --> 00:08:45.107]  Where does that term come from?
[00:08:45.167 --> 00:08:48.268]  You see it in movies like V for Vendetta, but where does it come from?
[00:08:48.668 --> 00:09:07.075]  The French resistance started spray painting and painting and carving and posting things all over Germany to unify the population through a peaceful movement of solidarity that they did not agree with the Vichy French that had collaborated with the Nazis and helped overthrow France during the German invasion.
[00:09:07.655 --> 00:09:08.816]  That was an inside job.
[00:09:09.276 --> 00:09:12.217]  Our country has been taken over by offshore banks
[00:09:12.717 --> 00:09:21.663]  Who have bankrupted hundreds of third world countries in the last hundred years by design with the same system they're now using against our Republic.
[00:09:21.683 --> 00:09:28.948]  Going in, buying off the politicians, getting them to buy into debt, getting them to underwrite derivatives, devaluing currencies.
[00:09:29.508 --> 00:09:36.193]  This is all being done by design as Greece has fallen, as Ireland is falling, as Greenland has partially fallen.
[00:09:36.413 --> 00:09:41.937]  The world is waking up and resisting this and they plan to do the same thing to the United States.
[00:09:42.717 --> 00:09:55.764]  In 2002, in March, Greg Pallast of BBC Television got the secret documents out of the IMF and World Bank, right at the time that Joseph Stiglitz, Nobel Prize winner for economics, quit.
[00:09:55.804 --> 00:09:56.824]  He claims he didn't release them.
[00:09:57.625 --> 00:10:01.967]  How they were planning to implode the Western world, just as they had done the Third World.
[00:10:02.727 --> 00:10:07.810]  Now, for over eight years, I have warned you of the time that we are now entering.
[00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:09.391]  This is a huge announcement.
[00:10:10.131 --> 00:10:11.212]  Here it is in front of us.
[00:10:11.372 --> 00:10:15.134]  A path is sought for states to escape their debt burdens.
[00:10:15.174 --> 00:10:15.775]  New York Times.
[00:10:16.175 --> 00:10:30.264]  Oh, to escape their debt burdens with the unfunded mandates, the federal government is going to accelerate the quantitative easing, the monetization of debt past $130 billion a month to $200 billion a month or even more of your tax money.
[00:10:30.604 --> 00:10:32.406]  Not only will it devalue our currencies,
[00:10:33.106 --> 00:10:40.650]  But it creates a debt black hole that is impossible to escape and then we owe this to the offshore banks openly announcing a world government run by them.
[00:10:42.791 --> 00:10:45.793]  We have to pay it back in taxes and it devalues our currency.
[00:10:46.273 --> 00:10:53.897]  The Chinese come here and openly put us down and say we own your debt and we're going to get off the dollar and our currency is going to be the world reserve currency.
[00:10:54.810 --> 00:11:05.471]  This will not just impoverish us, it will implode the geopolitical system that has been and bring us into this authoritarian world government.
[00:11:07.216 --> 00:11:29.143]  Ladies and gentlemen, we launched over a year ago TSA demonstrations with posters and videos and got our listeners going with those contests and it caused massive effects and then created ripples that have grown into the huge resistance that is teaching people how to come together against tyranny against the TSA absurdities of putting their hands down our pants of the body scanners.
[00:11:29.483 --> 00:11:30.484]  Now as we told you,
[00:11:31.164 --> 00:11:37.289]  The Homeland Security is putting out TV ads in the style of soap operas showing citizens spying on each other.
[00:11:37.589 --> 00:11:40.091]  Anybody that buys things with cash, call the police on them.
[00:11:40.371 --> 00:11:43.694]  If you see a cardboard box on the side of the road, call the bomb squad.
[00:11:44.014 --> 00:11:45.235]  It's creating hysteria.
[00:11:45.895 --> 00:11:59.926]  Every hour I see articles around the country with highways, buildings shut down, people panicking over a tin can on the side of the street, trying to create this culture of fear so that we will accept the unfolding police state that's meant to suppress the population
[00:12:00.447 --> 00:12:07.484]  As the economy is publicly imploded, as they admit what they've done, but offer more globalist control as the solution.
[00:12:10.456 --> 00:12:19.883]  I was going to launch today, and it's going to be up at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com in the next hour, Kurt's getting it together, the Answer to 1984-1776 contest.
[00:12:20.123 --> 00:12:29.910]  And obviously people want to make videos exposing TSA, exposing the globalists and the DHS rollout on the streets to expose this New World Order occupation, this banker takeover.
[00:12:31.305 --> 00:12:43.272]  But we have the contest element so that those that do the best job demonstrating, protesting, making videos, doing banner hangs, posting flyers, get recognition and adds an element of competition to it.
[00:12:44.032 --> 00:13:00.142]  But then I was talking to Paul Watson last night, and I called him at about six, midnight his time, he was still up working, and I said, Watson, over at PrisonPlanet.com over in England, I said, Watson, they are rolling out these TV soap opera mini-documentaries for television.
[00:13:00.982 --> 00:13:10.765]  He's also going to air on 9,000 telescreens going up nationwide at 9,000 locations, more than 9,000 individual screens, where it shows people in these situations spying on each other.
[00:13:11.025 --> 00:13:11.945]  We've got to counter this.
[00:13:11.985 --> 00:13:12.665]  And he said, yes.
[00:13:13.185 --> 00:13:16.166]  Why don't we just have people post Vs everywhere?
[00:13:16.486 --> 00:13:26.769]  Because he's been reading a book, and of course I'm familiar with it as well, most of you are, about the French resistance peacefully showing solidarity and that the people knew that they were occupied all over Germany.
[00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:38.532]  Putting, you know, V's on walls, V's on Nazi vehicles, posters hung everywhere, scratching them on the side of, you know, barroom tables.
[00:13:39.112 --> 00:13:46.674]  And it really began to bring down the Germans in France even before the D-Day invasion and liberation.
[00:13:47.534 --> 00:13:50.555]  America is occupied by outside banking cartels.
[00:13:51.568 --> 00:13:53.775]  And we are writing articles explaining that.
[00:13:53.915 --> 00:13:57.546]  I'm going to produce videos breaking that down, tied to the V symbol.
[00:13:58.732 --> 00:14:17.441]  That we're going to post and show you right now for PrisonPlanet.TV viewers, but the article is up on Infowars.com right now and we'll put that article up on screen and also show you these V's that Phil and I put together last night and gave to Watson this morning.
[00:14:17.921 --> 00:14:21.663]  The article is, you are the resistance against the DHS.
[00:14:22.583 --> 00:14:24.908]  Occupation of America.
[00:14:35.043 --> 00:14:40.007]  There's a message under it that simply states, we are all in danger.
[00:14:40.828 --> 00:14:43.931]  A police state control grid is being established in the United States.
[00:14:44.331 --> 00:14:49.416]  Now is the time for all lovers of liberty to stand together and speak out against the growing tyranny destroying our republic.
[00:14:49.696 --> 00:14:51.838]  We will be victorious against the New World Order.
[00:14:52.138 --> 00:14:57.063]  Post this V for Victory flyer to warn others and show your peaceful resistance, your solidarity.
[00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:00.311]  Learn more at InfoWars.com.
[00:15:00.411 --> 00:15:03.133]  And so every day we're going to be writing articles about this.
[00:15:03.253 --> 00:15:08.395]  Every day we're going to be posting local news when they cover these flyers going up in their areas.
[00:15:08.876 --> 00:15:13.178]  And of course the news will attack it and say it's evil, which will further prove their police state mechanisms.
[00:15:13.498 --> 00:15:23.724]  We did this with the Obama poster contest that was on hundreds of TV stations and hundreds of newspapers in the U.S., Latin America, Europe, England, the Netherlands, Japan.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:38.507]  And you saw the tens of millions of people that saw all the videos produced by our listeners of them posting the flyers or doing the banner hangs or other inventive things to get local debate about what are people talking about.
[00:15:38.787 --> 00:15:41.849]  Then the news will play clips of me talking here.
[00:15:41.869 --> 00:15:43.210]  They'll go get it off YouTube later.
[00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:52.635]  They will go over what we're talking about and put our message out for us and cause a huge buzz that will then cause more ripples.
[00:15:54.093 --> 00:15:58.056]  The DHS understands the power of getting the people involved in their evil.
[00:15:58.096 --> 00:16:12.345]  That's why they're running contests right now for folks to produce videos promoting paranoia and pro-New World Order, and worshipping the government, and not trusting each other, only trusting the federalization police state spy grid.
[00:16:13.086 --> 00:16:14.807]  This is a contest!
[00:16:16.038 --> 00:16:24.140]  Can the people overpower peacefully in the info war the usurpers, the outside banking cartel that's conquering this nation?
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:32.861]  Can you, this weekend, who will be the first to print off thousands of these color flyers, get your friends together, and hang them everywhere that's legal and lawful?
[00:16:33.201 --> 00:16:34.762]  Who will be the first to do banner hangs?
[00:16:34.962 --> 00:16:36.682]  Who will be the first to call in to talk radio?
[00:16:36.902 --> 00:16:40.143]  Who will be the first to get on live TV when they're outside doing live feeds?
[00:16:40.483 --> 00:16:41.763]  Who will be the first
[00:16:42.403 --> 00:16:44.685]  We're going to find out by Monday, probably even Sunday.
[00:16:58.055 --> 00:16:59.936]  Victory at Infowars.com.
[00:16:59.956 --> 00:17:04.520]  Please only send your videos, or news articles, or ideas, or flyers you've made, whatever.
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:14.628]  It's all of us working together through freedom, but collectively with a message, a manifesto, a constitution, a declaration of independence against the globalists.
[00:17:15.518 --> 00:17:17.799]  I cannot stress to you how important this is.
[00:17:17.879 --> 00:17:20.560]  It needs to explode in Infowar.
[00:17:21.001 --> 00:17:21.901]  I need you now.
[00:17:22.081 --> 00:17:22.621]  Don't wait.
[00:17:22.681 --> 00:17:23.642]  Go print these off.
[00:17:23.702 --> 00:17:25.282]  Take it to Kinko's FedEx.
[00:17:25.322 --> 00:17:25.923]  Take it wherever.
[00:17:26.123 --> 00:17:27.263]  Print off black and white ones.
[00:17:27.283 --> 00:17:28.364]  Print them on your home printer.
[00:17:28.744 --> 00:17:29.324]  I don't care.
[00:17:29.604 --> 00:17:30.745]  Hang them everywhere.
[00:17:31.025 --> 00:17:32.065]  Hang them everywhere.
[00:17:32.125 --> 00:17:33.186]  In Austin, Texas.
[00:17:33.306 --> 00:17:34.186]  In New York City.
[00:17:34.447 --> 00:17:35.367]  In Los Angeles.
[00:17:35.447 --> 00:17:36.287]  In Toronto.
[00:17:36.547 --> 00:17:37.588]  In Mexico City.
[00:17:37.928 --> 00:17:38.768]  In Tokyo.
[00:17:39.189 --> 00:17:40.029]  In Berlin.
[00:17:40.369 --> 00:17:41.029]  In London.
[00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:42.230]  In Sheffield.
[00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:43.731]  In Moscow.
[00:17:45.066 --> 00:17:50.408]  Worldwide, the banking cartel is trying to bankrupt nations and bring in a world government.
[00:17:50.448 --> 00:17:53.549]  This is a global movement of liberty against tyranny.
[00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:59.531]  It is unlimited what we can do if you simply take action, if you simply say no.
[00:17:59.551 --> 00:18:09.495]  Now, separately, the 1984, the answer to the 1984-1976 contest is specifically going out, demonstrating, using the V symbol, whatever you want to do,
[00:18:10.663 --> 00:18:21.351]  Creatively, the sky's the limit, and all of us win in the fight against tyranny, even if you don't win the $10,000 prize, that we'll a month from now announce.
[00:18:21.411 --> 00:18:25.094]  You've got to get them in in the next month and a week later, so five weeks later, we'll announce the winner of that.
[00:18:25.375 --> 00:18:29.278]  That's just to add some competition and to recognize, you know, whoever's produced the best.
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:39.263]  Uh, this has already been incredibly effective, this has got to be our biggest ever, and I know, I could feel it last night when Watson had this idea that it all synergistically came together.
[00:18:39.323 --> 00:18:47.085]  I was freaked out, I was depressed, I was pacing around up here actually yelling, uh, you know, not even that loud, just like, I can't believe this is happening!
[00:18:47.105 --> 00:18:49.006]  I can't believe this is such classical tyranny!
[00:18:49.306 --> 00:18:50.606]  We've got to stand against this.
[00:18:51.867 --> 00:18:55.508]  And the ripples that are felt by this will continue out forever.
[00:18:57.247 --> 00:18:59.588]  We are pointing out that we know we're occupied.
[00:18:59.608 --> 00:19:01.929]  We're pointing out that we know a takeover is taking place.
[00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:05.551]  We're pointing out that we know that they're bankrupting our nation by design.
[00:19:05.751 --> 00:19:08.493]  We're pointing out that we know local spy grids are being set up.
[00:19:08.753 --> 00:19:11.875]  And we're coming out and saying, we know this is illegitimate.
[00:19:12.555 --> 00:19:20.039]  And then folks will go to InfoWars.com, they will see the videos that you shoot of your activism, and they will learn what the V symbolizes.
[00:19:20.079 --> 00:19:26.383]  And through that solidarity, it will inspire them to know they're not alone, to know that we really are the majority that love liberty.
[00:19:26.403 --> 00:19:31.385]  Black, white, old, young, German, Chinese, Jewish, Arab, it doesn't matter.
[00:19:32.126 --> 00:19:34.287]  We've all got to come together now.
[00:19:34.547 --> 00:19:36.148]  Whether you're in Chile, or whether
[00:19:36.488 --> 00:19:38.810]  You are in the Netherlands.
[00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:47.516]  It doesn't matter whether you are in Saudi Arabia or whether you are in South Africa, whether you are in Nigeria or whether you are in Mongolia.
[00:19:47.897 --> 00:19:50.679]  Let's stand up against tyranny worldwide together.
[00:19:51.159 --> 00:19:52.360]  Victory for humanity.
[00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:53.721]  Victory for liberty.
[00:19:54.121 --> 00:19:55.082]  Victory for the truth.
[00:19:55.522 --> 00:19:56.443]  Come together now.
[00:19:56.723 --> 00:19:58.945]  Let's explode this information everywhere.
[00:19:58.965 --> 00:19:59.805]  V for victory!

[00:21:01.562 --> 00:21:05.186]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:21:05.586 --> 00:21:08.590]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:13.595]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:21:13.615 --> 00:21:19.862]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:21:20.002 --> 00:21:22.265]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:21:22.785 --> 00:21:23.065]  Tim Geithner?
[00:21:23.085 --> 00:21:23.525]  Bernanke?
[00:21:23.585 --> 00:21:23.945]  They're arsonists!
[00:21:23.965 --> 00:21:25.026]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:21:25.366 --> 00:21:27.786]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:45.611]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[00:21:46.071 --> 00:21:48.592]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[00:22:38.817 --> 00:22:39.558]  This capitalism?
[00:22:39.618 --> 00:22:45.742]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:22:45.862 --> 00:22:46.703]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:22:46.743 --> 00:22:49.845]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.

[00:23:00.111 --> 00:23:03.152]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:23:03.473 --> 00:23:10.835]  Did you know that candidates to run for the presidency are selected in advance by ultra-billionaires called Bilderbergers?
[00:23:11.696 --> 00:23:15.377]  They hold private meetings once a year to plan the future for the world.
[00:23:16.258 --> 00:23:19.939]  They invite possible candidates to see if they fit their agenda.
[00:23:20.799 --> 00:23:22.280]  If they don't, they lose.
[00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:27.082]  They also snub any constitutionalists that are fighting world government.
[00:23:27.882 --> 00:23:32.946]  They want to rule the world through economic power, thus the coming Mark of the Beast.
[00:23:34.067 --> 00:23:42.773]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:24:03.015 --> 00:24:05.357]  Thank you for joining us for this historic broadcast.
[00:24:05.877 --> 00:24:09.940]  Yesterday you made the two search terms about China trying to own the U.S.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.381]  number one and number two on Google.
[00:24:11.801 --> 00:24:20.347]  Today I want to launch our most ambitious operation yet with the Google bomb to launch this V for Victory operation and the answer to 1984 is 1776 operation.
[00:24:23.729 --> 00:24:25.230]  And so please write these down.
[00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:29.412]  I want to get the top four search terms today.
[00:24:30.212 --> 00:24:33.174]  I want you are resistance.
[00:24:33.674 --> 00:24:36.756]  You are resistance as one search term.
[00:24:36.796 --> 00:24:38.337]  That will lead them to the V campaign.
[00:24:38.937 --> 00:24:42.439]  You are resistance is the number one search term.
[00:24:42.799 --> 00:24:44.060]  You are resistance.
[00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:44.900]  Those three words.
[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:46.301]  You're doing an incredible job.
[00:24:46.321 --> 00:24:47.862]  Let's continue doing this together.
[00:24:49.192 --> 00:24:50.934]  This is very exciting what we're doing.
[00:24:50.954 --> 00:24:52.715]  You are resistance.
[00:24:52.955 --> 00:24:58.640]  The second search term is going to be V. Just the letter V.
[00:25:00.114 --> 00:25:01.855]  V for victory.
[00:25:02.295 --> 00:25:03.235]  That's the second term.
[00:25:03.255 --> 00:25:05.496]  So the number one term is, you are resistance.
[00:25:06.037 --> 00:25:08.938]  Short for, you are the resistance, because you don't want to do four words, it won't work.
[00:25:09.298 --> 00:25:10.279]  You are resistance.
[00:25:10.319 --> 00:25:11.659]  Short for, you are the resistance.
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.561]  And V for victory.
[00:25:15.101 --> 00:25:16.902]  V for victory.
[00:25:17.682 --> 00:25:17.962]  Okay?
[00:25:18.082 --> 00:25:22.384]  So that's number one is, you are resistance, is the number one search term.
[00:25:22.864 --> 00:25:25.506]  Number two is, V for victory.
[00:25:26.606 --> 00:25:27.367]  And number three is,
[00:25:29.073 --> 00:25:30.594]  Occupation of America!
[00:25:30.895 --> 00:25:32.216]  Occupation of America!
[00:25:32.656 --> 00:25:38.340]  All of those come out of the headline, you are the resistance against the DHS Occupation of America.
[00:25:38.601 --> 00:25:52.612]  This is the treasonous paramilitary force openly taking over the US, confirming everything that Ridge said they would do eight years ago, occupying the entire nation, training us for a Stasi society, they hired the former head,
[00:25:53.292 --> 00:26:00.195]  Of the Stasi in East Germany, Marcus Wolff for three years on million-dollar contracts to set all this up.
[00:26:00.215 --> 00:26:02.236]  2002, 2003, 2004, he died a few years ago.
[00:26:02.677 --> 00:26:04.898]  I mean, you cannot make something up this insane.
[00:26:05.538 --> 00:26:06.798]  So, you are resistance.
[00:26:06.838 --> 00:26:07.739]  Number one, search term.
[00:26:08.299 --> 00:26:09.600]  Number two, V for victory.
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:12.021]  Number three, occupation of America.
[00:26:12.721 --> 00:26:17.503]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are going to do this together, and I'm risking my life doing this, okay?
[00:26:18.004 --> 00:26:18.664]  I want you to know that.
[00:26:18.764 --> 00:26:20.045]  I'm at the tip of the spear right here.
[00:26:20.125 --> 00:26:20.565]  I don't care.
[00:26:21.656 --> 00:26:27.820]  I will not have my children and my grandchildren to come being slaves, and you shouldn't either, and there's no doubt about what's happening.
[00:26:28.141 --> 00:26:30.502]  As we told you, they do the same thing in every other nation.
[00:26:30.703 --> 00:26:35.106]  They take control of the central government, they bankrupt the states, the provinces, the sectors.
[00:26:36.725 --> 00:26:43.429]  And then they bring it into international receivership and instead of paying, the nation paying 5, 10 percent for the debt to the bankers, it's made up out of nothing.
[00:26:43.609 --> 00:26:44.129]  You start paying 15, 20, 30.
[00:26:44.649 --> 00:26:46.690]  Then it's more impossible to pay.
[00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:47.851]  Then it's even higher.
[00:26:48.571 --> 00:26:50.512]  And a billion dollar debt can turn into a hundred billion.
[00:26:50.933 --> 00:26:55.095]  They claim we owe 14 plus trillion to these bankers and it's all made up.
[00:26:56.203 --> 00:26:56.343]  I don't
[00:27:11.203 --> 00:27:13.926]  Their own government admits it's foreign banker debt they don't owe.
[00:27:14.246 --> 00:27:15.708]  The same thing's happening here.
[00:27:16.128 --> 00:27:17.209]  Iceland's saying no.
[00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:19.332]  We have to be an example worldwide.
[00:27:19.352 --> 00:27:25.698]  Instead of America being an example of decadence and corruption and genocide, we need to be an example of liberty and freedom again.
[00:27:25.999 --> 00:27:26.619]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:27:30.123 --> 00:27:32.566]  So please, all of you go to InfoWars.com.
[00:27:32.906 --> 00:27:41.016]  All of you go to PrisonPlanet.com and get the article with the PDF of all these different great V designs that we put together last night.
[00:27:41.297 --> 00:27:44.521]  You are the resistance against the DHS occupation of America.
[00:27:44.881 --> 00:27:46.123]  V for Victory Campaign.
[00:27:46.143 --> 00:27:46.763]  I'm Mark.
[00:27:47.404 --> 00:27:51.287]  of defiance against Homeland Security's takeover of society.
[00:27:51.647 --> 00:27:52.267]  It is there.
[00:27:52.327 --> 00:27:56.810]  We're putting our John Hancocks on the Declaration of Independence.
[00:27:56.830 --> 00:28:02.894]  2011, as we go straight into this tyranny, we are saying no on every front right now.
[00:28:02.994 --> 00:28:09.939]  We are showing solidarity that we know what's happening, and we're waking others up who will question what this V campaign is about.
[00:28:11.004 --> 00:28:13.806]  So make your videos exposing the Homeland Security takeover.
[00:28:14.266 --> 00:28:20.329]  That's the answer to the 1984 and 1776 operation that will have unbelievable reverberations for freedom and awakening.
[00:28:20.709 --> 00:28:25.152]  And at the heart of that, you can incorporate it into both, the V for Victory campaign.
[00:28:25.492 --> 00:28:26.173]  Do not wait.
[00:28:26.233 --> 00:28:27.173]  Print them off today.
[00:28:27.473 --> 00:28:28.114]  Hit them hard.
[00:28:28.174 --> 00:28:29.354]  Put them up again next week.
[00:28:29.434 --> 00:28:30.255]  Do not stop.
[00:28:30.515 --> 00:28:31.275]  Do not wait.
[00:28:31.335 --> 00:28:32.616]  Get involved today.
[00:28:32.836 --> 00:28:34.217]  Do you realize what we can do together?
[00:28:34.277 --> 00:28:39.160]  We can sit back and watch this spread, not just across the United States, but across the world.
[00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:41.041]  And the tyrants will take the bait.
[00:28:41.361 --> 00:28:42.442]  They will demonize this.
[00:28:42.482 --> 00:28:43.323]  They will attack it.
[00:28:43.663 --> 00:28:47.666]  They will say that it's violent when the whole thing is about peaceful awakening.
[00:28:47.946 --> 00:28:48.746]  We are the people.
[00:28:48.806 --> 00:28:49.687]  We are the sovereigns.
[00:28:49.727 --> 00:28:50.487]  It's we the people.
[00:28:50.748 --> 00:28:51.528]  It's our nation.
[00:28:51.788 --> 00:28:55.291]  We have a right to say no to going under IMF World Bank receivership.
[00:28:55.911 --> 00:29:04.436]  And they will take the bait, as they did with the Obama posters, and they will demonize it all over the news, and it will cause a bigger explosion of this info.
[00:29:04.676 --> 00:29:09.538]  But we got to move quick, because we learned earlier the orders will start going out to tell media not to cover this.
[00:29:09.558 --> 00:29:15.562]  So we got to hit them hard before the next few days when they get the orders trickling down locally not to cover this, and that'll wake them up.
[00:29:15.782 --> 00:29:17.103]  They'll ask, why are we being told this?
[00:29:17.483 --> 00:29:18.423]  Get it out now.
[00:29:18.944 --> 00:29:20.504]  The CIA is watching right now.
[00:29:20.544 --> 00:29:24.627]  The Globalists, the offshore banks, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, they know what we're doing.
[00:29:25.387 --> 00:29:26.528]  But there's so many of us.
[00:29:26.608 --> 00:29:27.488]  We are the majority.
[00:29:27.548 --> 00:29:28.889]  We are liberty.
[00:29:28.929 --> 00:29:30.409]  And we're showing people that.
[00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:36.512]  We're putting our colors out there loud and proud so people understand that there is a resistance.
[00:29:36.612 --> 00:29:42.275]  If you're listening to my voice, if you're watching me right now, if you're reading our websites, you are the resistance.
[00:29:42.335 --> 00:29:43.296]  You are the solution.
[00:29:43.736 --> 00:29:44.496]  Look in the mirror.
[00:29:44.796 --> 00:29:45.617]  It's up to you.
[00:29:45.777 --> 00:29:46.377]  Come together.
[00:29:46.417 --> 00:29:47.278]  We need each other.
[00:29:50.659 --> 00:29:51.560]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:53.561]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.572 --> 00:29:57.270]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:04.353]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:30:04.593 --> 00:30:10.637]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:30:10.997 --> 00:30:18.102]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:30:18.382 --> 00:30:22.965]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[00:30:23.265 --> 00:30:26.988]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com.
[00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:31.611]  We're good to go.
[00:31:00.089 --> 00:31:01.230]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:31:01.271 --> 00:31:07.958]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:31:08.218 --> 00:31:10.521]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:31:10.781 --> 00:31:15.947]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:31:16.147 --> 00:31:18.929]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:31:19.189 --> 00:31:21.290]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:27.434]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:31:27.754 --> 00:31:30.956]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:31:31.136 --> 00:31:36.659]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:38.220]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:31:38.561 --> 00:31:39.721]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:31:39.861 --> 00:31:42.403]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:31:42.523 --> 00:31:43.944]  He explains everything you need to know.
[00:31:44.204 --> 00:31:46.548]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:32:00.166 --> 00:32:03.470]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:32:03.731 --> 00:32:04.812]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:32:04.872 --> 00:32:09.237]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:32:09.438 --> 00:32:15.065]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:32:16.246 --> 00:32:16.706]  We're good to go.
[00:32:34.594 --> 00:32:39.597]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis and you can't eat paper, stocks or metals.
[00:32:39.877 --> 00:32:45.060]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:48.222]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[00:32:48.442 --> 00:32:51.324]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[00:32:51.344 --> 00:32:52.444]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[00:33:08.772 --> 00:33:11.674]  Well, I won't back down.
[00:33:12.995 --> 00:33:15.796]  No, I won't back down.
[00:33:16.257 --> 00:33:19.939]  Okay, until the end of the hour, Congressman Ron Paul joins us.
[00:33:20.019 --> 00:33:23.441]  And there is so much to talk about with the Congressman.
[00:33:23.461 --> 00:33:28.664]  Of course, his son, Rand Paul, now the junior senator from Kentucky.
[00:33:29.244 --> 00:33:34.027]  And we're very excited to have him here with us today from his Lake Jackson office.
[00:33:34.067 --> 00:33:36.669]  Congressman, Happy New Year to you.
[00:33:37.309 --> 00:33:37.670]  Thank you.
[00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:38.150]  Same to you.
[00:33:38.852 --> 00:33:40.653]  There's so much to talk about here.
[00:33:41.674 --> 00:34:02.310]  Out of the gates, you're now the chairman of that banking subcommittee dealing with the Federal Reserve and it couldn't be a more perfect time as the New York Times announces the federal government is preparing to basically take the states in under receivership and their bankruptcy and as the Chinese openly say that it's time for the dollar to not be the world reserve currency.
[00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:03.971]  Can you speak to your concerns?
[00:34:04.011 --> 00:34:06.934]  A few years ago you said something big is about to happen.
[00:34:07.074 --> 00:34:08.495]  Are we now on the cusp of that?
[00:34:09.175 --> 00:34:12.698]  We certainly are, and it's going to get a lot worse.
[00:34:12.778 --> 00:34:22.066]  Even though we had this major crisis starting in 07-08, I thought that was just the beginning because the real crisis comes with the dollar.
[00:34:22.346 --> 00:34:26.210]  When people lose confidence in the dollar, the dollar doesn't deserve confidence that it has.
[00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:31.705]  But you can put confidence in something that isn't real if you're deceived.
[00:34:31.725 --> 00:34:40.114]  And people are deceived that we are very wealthy and we have a great military and therefore we can trust the United States because of our past performances.
[00:34:40.674 --> 00:34:47.381]  But eventually that is eroded and people will reject it and I think that we're witnessing that with the Chinese.
[00:34:49.583 --> 00:34:53.926]  Sadly, I guess, in a way, they have become more capitalistic than ours.
[00:34:54.006 --> 00:35:00.150]  I don't care about them becoming more capitalistic, but I don't like the idea that we become more militaristic and more socialistic.
[00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:01.211]  That's what's so bad.
[00:35:01.731 --> 00:35:05.353]  But they have their problems in China, but just think of what they've done.
[00:35:05.374 --> 00:35:06.814]  They produce and they save money.
[00:35:07.315 --> 00:35:10.057]  They take the money and they buy up resources around the world.
[00:35:10.077 --> 00:35:11.177]  They buy gold.
[00:35:11.278 --> 00:35:12.358]  They're a wealthy country.
[00:35:12.378 --> 00:35:13.599]  They loan us all this money.
[00:35:13.679 --> 00:35:14.680]  They're in the driver's seat.
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:24.584]  Don't you think that if you or I or any American was involved in that, we wouldn't be wanting to just be taking paper money that they know is going to depreciate.
[00:35:24.624 --> 00:35:25.524]  There would be a limit.
[00:35:25.544 --> 00:35:27.425]  And I think we're at that point.
[00:35:27.485 --> 00:35:32.947]  And when that happens, that will be a major event when the world rejects the dollar.
[00:35:33.027 --> 00:35:38.089]  So when it comes and how it comes and how quickly it comes, those are still unknowns.
[00:35:38.629 --> 00:35:39.670]  But it will come.
[00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:42.311]  And I think we're starting to see it happen right now.
[00:35:43.084 --> 00:35:43.625]  Absolutely.
[00:35:43.685 --> 00:35:52.242]  Congressman, as a doctor, as a congressperson, as someone who's been on the banking committees for many years and has studied Austrian economics, for those that don't know,
[00:35:55.407 --> 00:35:59.148]  Comparing our situation to the Weimar Republic, I see a lot of similarities.
[00:35:59.408 --> 00:36:03.389]  We're already seeing inflation in commodities and inflation in food.
[00:36:04.549 --> 00:36:07.150]  What is the basic time frame that you see currently?
[00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:14.232]  And for those that don't know, what does dollar devaluation and the dollar losing world reserve currency status mean for people?
[00:36:14.732 --> 00:36:19.113]  Well, it means higher prices and eventually higher interest rates, which means higher prices again.
[00:36:22.702 --> 00:36:35.745]  The government always reports statistics that are deceiving, and they tell us that inflation is like one and a half, two percent, and yet if you talk to the average person, they know that prices are going up, and you're right about the commodities.
[00:36:35.785 --> 00:36:44.027]  There was a report yesterday, I think it was the S&P Commodity Index, for last year, a whole group of commodities, it was up at 24 percent.
[00:36:44.907 --> 00:36:45.187]  That's huge!
[00:36:46.447 --> 00:36:52.572]  And you can't have that and not have that translate into, you know, day-to-day living.
[00:36:52.892 --> 00:36:53.593]  People know this.
[00:36:53.633 --> 00:36:59.697]  The energy prices are going to go up and it wouldn't take much to push that oil up over $100.
[00:36:59.817 --> 00:37:01.639]  It's bouncing around there already.
[00:37:02.399 --> 00:37:04.581]  And which means the standard of living goes down.
[00:37:04.821 --> 00:37:18.993]  You know, if an individual borrows and they get into debt, but they live high on the hog and they buy more cars than they need and have a fancy house, and their job is just marginal, but if they lose their job or prices go up, they get wiped out.
[00:37:19.153 --> 00:37:24.017]  And they have to, in order to get back on their feet again, they have to work harder and spend less.
[00:37:24.637 --> 00:37:31.585]  It's a little different with a country because they have this printing press and they're able to tax people, but there is a limit.
[00:37:31.946 --> 00:37:36.531]  But the economic law is the same for the country as it is for the individual.
[00:37:36.591 --> 00:37:39.094]  The country eventually has to live beneath its means.
[00:37:39.574 --> 00:37:43.638]  And that's what we're witnessing now, and it usually hits some people more than others.
[00:37:43.698 --> 00:37:45.960]  So the middle class and the poor get hit the first.
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:49.483]  They lose their jobs, and they're hurt the most through the inflation.
[00:37:49.843 --> 00:37:52.926]  The very wealthy, actually, there's a transfer of wealth.
[00:37:53.266 --> 00:38:06.298]  This has been argued by Austrian economists for decades, that when you destroy a currency, it erodes the value of the currency, but the middle class suffer the most, and the wealth is accumulated by the very rich.
[00:38:06.818 --> 00:38:07.519]  And we see that.
[00:38:07.919 --> 00:38:09.480]  We're seeing that, and what does it do?
[00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:15.584]  It drives up resentment, you know, and if they don't fully understand this, the middle class is getting wiped out.
[00:38:16.045 --> 00:38:24.711]  They only have anger, and they might strike out everybody who has wealth, rather than the wealth that has been accumulated because of the government programs.
[00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:33.122]  And the social engineers, as you know, Dr. Paul, Congressman, they're fully aware of that, the pressure from above and below.
[00:38:33.562 --> 00:38:51.008]  And so right when they got rid of the Glass-Steagall 11 years ago, we start seeing RAND Corporation reports, we start seeing Department of Defense reports saying we've got to basically set up a police state because there's a danger of social unrest coming because of the dwindling middle class.
[00:38:51.308 --> 00:38:54.769]  And now we see a British Ministry of Defense report saying the same thing.
[00:38:55.770 --> 00:39:03.679]  In 2007 and lo and behold, now Homeland Security's putting in 9,000 locations, telescreens, saying watch your neighbors.
[00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:09.445]  Three new videos were released yesterday, frightening videos by Homeland Security airing on TV.
[00:39:10.146 --> 00:39:26.250]  They're up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com if listeners want to see it or if the congressman hasn't seen it and it's got people in shopping malls and on the streets and it shows DHS, TSA on the streets searching people and it says we're going to protect you but we need you to watch your neighbors.
[00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:31.671]  I mean clearly they're trying to bring in an authoritarian system not for Al Qaeda
[00:39:32.211 --> 00:39:48.026]  Or these overseas reported threats, but they're now shifting it over to domestic groups and we saw that attempt to attack conservatives and libertarians and yourself and myself and even Sarah Palin and Rush Limbaugh and talk radio in the First Amendment after the tragic shooting.
[00:39:48.086 --> 00:39:54.632]  So, can you speak to that, sir, and this conscious movement towards authoritarianism?
[00:39:54.952 --> 00:40:05.323]  Well, there's no doubt about it, and you're absolutely right about the disruption that comes to the communities, because it is there.
[00:40:05.803 --> 00:40:09.127]  Most major changes occur domestically.
[00:40:09.387 --> 00:40:15.554]  We take an oath of office to obey the Constitution and defend it against enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:40:16.074 --> 00:40:28.486]  Well, you know, I usually make that point, and even in the very, very patriotic crowds of veterans which you think would be more hawkish, if you emphasize, you know, the domestic threat, they understand this.
[00:40:29.307 --> 00:40:39.197]  But I think we're actually winning this argument about this need for militarism around the world to protect ourselves and that we have to worry about domestically because
[00:40:39.577 --> 00:40:45.019]  People are getting tired of having somebody from the government check every single thing.
[00:40:45.339 --> 00:40:51.181]  You know, back again to China, you can start businesses easier in China than here.
[00:40:51.301 --> 00:41:03.826]  So people who have land, people who want to start a business, people who have to pay these high taxes and pay for all these regulations, they're starting to realize this.
[00:41:06.227 --> 00:41:20.391]  I think there's a healthy resistance developing, but like you point out, there is some danger here, and that is, of course, if we get people to understand where the cause comes from, that we might be able to prevent it.
[00:41:20.671 --> 00:41:29.034]  See, the one thing, the one coalition that we should build, we talk a lot about the poor getting poorer, the middle class being wiped out.
[00:41:29.719 --> 00:41:35.020]  But the left always think, well, the answer to that is just more transfer of wealth.
[00:41:35.701 --> 00:41:45.743]  But we have to get them to understand that the reason it happened is because government is too big, even though they argue for government programs, the government is too big.
[00:41:46.203 --> 00:41:48.884]  They argue for these programs and get who lost their homes.
[00:41:48.904 --> 00:41:54.026]  The rich got richer and the poor people lost their homes because of this program.
[00:41:54.346 --> 00:41:54.666]  But the big
[00:41:56.039 --> 00:42:06.071]  The other big issue is to make sure that people know that, you know, corporatism is not free market economics, and that's a misunderstanding.
[00:42:06.091 --> 00:42:14.380]  Well, that was my other point, and I'm glad you got into that, because we're of the same mind because we've studied history, but quantify that for listeners who may be new.
[00:42:14.901 --> 00:42:32.577]  The ultra-robber baron, non-free market, crony capitalist, always, as Carol Quigley said at Georgetown, Bill Clinton's mentor, lobby for authoritarianism, whether it's right-wing, left-wing, fascist, socialist, communist, because they create this big pool of collectivized wealth and they take it offshore.
[00:42:33.297 --> 00:42:41.304]  And now the ultra-rich are trying to sell the poor people who are losing their jobs on higher taxes and looting their neighbor who's got more money than them.
[00:42:42.827 --> 00:42:48.779]  Selling them the lie that that's going to give them a good economy when it's freedom that's going to give them a future.
[00:42:49.167 --> 00:42:51.207]  Yeah, and then they lump everybody together.
[00:42:51.328 --> 00:43:00.390]  If you are a businessman, and there are a lot of very decent, wealthy businessmen in this country that earned it and didn't have to live off the government, but they get lumped into that.
[00:43:00.410 --> 00:43:15.013]  So when there's unrest, everybody's lumped together, whether they're the people who lived off the government, lived off the taxpayer, or whether they were successful because they delivered good products to consumers at good prices.
[00:43:15.933 --> 00:43:17.415]  So there's a big difference there.
[00:43:17.435 --> 00:43:27.842]  And you know, I've had some discussion with Ralph Nader, and I imagine there are a few of your listeners that can't stand Ralph Nader, but I like to talk to him, because we do come up with some agreements on this.
[00:43:27.902 --> 00:43:35.848]  I mean, he hates this corporatism, and he doesn't like the war and things, so I work with people who can agree with me on some of this.
[00:43:36.288 --> 00:43:43.514]  So this is what we have to do, is make sure our definitions are clear, then we have a better chance at solving these problems.
[00:43:44.890 --> 00:43:45.831]  Very well said.
[00:43:46.131 --> 00:43:52.756]  Congressman, we're seeing riots all over the world over global inflation driven by the devaluation of the dollar and other fiat currencies.
[00:43:52.796 --> 00:44:00.922]  You've been mentioning unrest here and clearly we're seeing more and more signs of that here and I remember you back in
[00:44:01.542 --> 00:44:01.822]  I think?
[00:44:18.436 --> 00:44:23.879]  But that more often than not, instead the government's going to sell even more of the same as the solution.
[00:44:23.919 --> 00:44:27.802]  And so now is the time to get this out to people.
[00:44:27.842 --> 00:44:31.804]  I mean, this is a life and death situation for our republic, is it not?
[00:44:32.385 --> 00:44:37.488]  Yes, and it's hard teaching people some of these lessons in the midst of a crisis.
[00:44:38.048 --> 00:44:47.514]  Because then, and you can understand the emotions, you know, when law and order breaks down, most people say, well, just quit the killing, calm down.
[00:44:47.534 --> 00:44:47.854]  Some things.
[00:44:47.874 --> 00:44:49.416]  You better bring more police in.
[00:44:49.696 --> 00:45:01.188]  And that's a pretty natural response, but not realizing that we have had too many policemen already and too many bureaucrats and too much federal government, too much taxes and all that.
[00:45:01.488 --> 00:45:05.432]  So to me, the earlier the education occurs, the better.
[00:45:05.673 --> 00:45:08.656]  I think people have to know and understand why it's in their best interest.
[00:45:09.356 --> 00:45:12.700]  That the free market works better.
[00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:15.402]  People think that you have to sacrifice and all this.
[00:45:15.442 --> 00:45:17.284]  I don't think you have to sacrifice a thing.
[00:45:17.544 --> 00:45:17.844]  Freedom.
[00:45:18.165 --> 00:45:21.388]  If you get your freedom, you don't have to sacrifice anything.
[00:45:21.608 --> 00:45:24.190]  Because you have your incentives.
[00:45:24.210 --> 00:45:26.633]  You can take care of yourself a lot better than the government.
[00:45:26.773 --> 00:45:29.275]  And that's a system that has worked.
[00:45:29.335 --> 00:45:31.057]  And unfortunately, we're about to give it up.
[00:45:31.597 --> 00:45:40.261]  And that's why I fear the day when law and order breaks down and people are questioning whether there'll be riots in our streets like there have been overseas already.
[00:45:40.721 --> 00:45:49.225]  And I suspect that the American people are like other people, and even in the 60s we had our riots and our shares of problems here.
[00:45:49.245 --> 00:45:52.387]  So people will act in a violent manner.
[00:45:53.147 --> 00:46:01.092]  And that's up for grabs and all factions then will be looking to get the powers and the strings of government.
[00:46:01.152 --> 00:46:03.794]  So we have a big job ahead of us.
[00:46:04.314 --> 00:46:06.516]  So we're going into some very stormy waters?
[00:46:07.996 --> 00:46:08.537]  No doubt.
[00:46:10.512 --> 00:46:33.892]  Congressman, no doubt you've probably heard about it or seen it, but CNN, MSNBC, Democracy Now, they all singled you and I out specifically and played clips of you speaking in your Texas Straight Talk and clips of my radio slash TV show where we talked about the Second Amendment being there and it's in the Declaration of Independence, it's in the Bill of Rights.
[00:46:35.325 --> 00:46:35.505]  to
[00:46:50.585 --> 00:46:58.629]  I'm not blaming the Democrats.
[00:46:59.049 --> 00:47:00.650]  But what do you think about the desperation?
[00:47:00.690 --> 00:47:10.034]  We saw Rachel Maddow and others go after your son and tell a laundry list of Dr. Rand Paul, and of course that backfired on him.
[00:47:10.054 --> 00:47:12.775]  Only seemed to boost his approval rating when Clinton went and campaigned against him.
[00:47:13.155 --> 00:47:17.177]  Now we see them doing it against you and I because they see us as a threat because we're getting the truth out.
[00:47:17.938 --> 00:47:31.879]  What is your view on A, the ratcheting up of their rhetoric, Congressman Steve Cohen calling Republicans Nazis a few days ago, and the fact that it's backfiring in every case from the polls we're seeing?
[00:47:33.322 --> 00:47:36.403]  Well, there's a limit, and that says something for the American people.
[00:47:36.443 --> 00:47:41.744]  Maybe they won't buy into that, but they're certainly going to make any effort.
[00:47:42.324 --> 00:47:59.509]  And this is a frustration for me, because I do make a diligent effort to try to work with honest, straightforward people who may be called progressives and liberals, because some of them are decent and they're honest, but they're not these demagogues, and those people who turn on you
[00:48:00.149 --> 00:48:09.071]  Their goal is more like the promotion of the Democrat Party or promoting of government power.
[00:48:10.171 --> 00:48:29.215]  So they might say they agree with us on a couple issues, but I sort them out and some of the ones that you're talking about are just the demagogues who may say one thing and say, oh yeah, we don't like this, we don't like that, but then they'll turn on you and they'll do anything to maintain their power or to discredit us.
[00:48:29.935 --> 00:48:32.757]  Well, and it's also hypocritical.
[00:48:33.257 --> 00:48:40.081]  They're demonizing the First Amendment and talking about Fairness Doctrine for talk radio, FCC, jurisdiction over the Internet.
[00:48:40.101 --> 00:48:43.623]  This is all being announced while Matthews is calling
[00:48:44.488 --> 00:48:45.589]  White people crackers.
[00:48:47.090 --> 00:48:49.772]  Maddow is implying that we're causing violence.
[00:48:51.273 --> 00:48:53.574]  The congressman's calling Republicans Nazis.
[00:48:54.315 --> 00:49:01.039]  I mean, it's just incredible how they're trying to balkanize and turn the American people against each other.
[00:49:01.299 --> 00:49:07.724]  When you look at the polls, liberals, conservatives, libertarians, almost everybody's against the banker bailouts, the wars.
[00:49:07.844 --> 00:49:10.886]  I mean, the momentum is shifting towards freedom.
[00:49:12.011 --> 00:49:19.353]  No doubt about that, but there's still a lot of people, and I think that you can say at the grassroots level that is the case.
[00:49:19.813 --> 00:49:39.078]  Our problem has been, you know, it's taken a long time to build the bureaucracy, and when you think of these millions of people who are living off the government and work for the government, they work in Washington, they're embedded into the political system, and so many in Congress, they have all clung to these views that they've held before.
[00:49:39.138 --> 00:49:40.058]  But the American people,
[00:49:41.118 --> 00:49:43.260]  Uh, you know, are further ahead.
[00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:53.407]  I think the people are always ahead of the politicians and, uh, hopefully we'll win out on this fight, but unfortunately, uh, the opposition has a lot of guns.
[00:49:53.487 --> 00:49:59.551]  It is interesting how they want to take our guns away, but everything the government does depends on a gun.
[00:50:01.212 --> 00:50:18.124]  It's their guns against the guns of the civilians, but whether it's tax collection or telling you whether you can dig a ditch on your land and how you can use your land, you may be accosted by a federal agent with a gun.
[00:50:18.164 --> 00:50:20.846]  Everything they do has to be enforced with a gun.
[00:50:20.966 --> 00:50:21.606]  It's a threat.
[00:50:25.548 --> 00:50:27.709]  They never talk about that kind of gun violence.
[00:50:28.609 --> 00:50:45.053]  How often have I been barging into houses, into the wrong houses with guns blaring and blowing up the places and looking for drugs that didn't exist and not even apologize and never compensate these people and sometimes hurt and kill some of these people, innocent people.
[00:50:45.773 --> 00:50:50.694]  And that's the kind of gun violence that ought to be, you know, rejected.
[00:50:51.050 --> 00:50:51.530]  Absolutely.
[00:50:51.550 --> 00:50:54.051]  Mao Zedong said political power goes out of the barrel of a gun.
[00:50:54.291 --> 00:50:56.652]  Well, we're the people and that's our check and balance.
[00:50:56.672 --> 00:51:02.734]  Congressman, in the eight minutes we've got left with you, we have a PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com headline.
[00:51:03.034 --> 00:51:19.020]  Congressman, Senator, or President, as you know, a lot of big scientific polls, the Hill newspaper, the Democratic affiliate Public Policy Polling, and others are finding that you're in the number one or number two seat to win the Texas Senate race
[00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:19.840]  I don't
[00:51:40.672 --> 00:51:46.617]  Powerful educational platform, I'd say ten times bigger than 2008, going into the critical crisis.
[00:51:47.157 --> 00:51:52.141]  But if you go for Senate, you've probably got a better chance of winning.
[00:51:53.122 --> 00:51:59.046]  Congressman, and of course then you'd have even more power with the filibuster in the Senate, Congressman Ron Paul.
[00:52:00.087 --> 00:52:01.047]  That's, you know, the question.
[00:52:01.187 --> 00:52:02.167]  A. What are you looking at there?
[00:52:02.207 --> 00:52:10.549]  And B. You've said the people, if they're behind you, and if things continue to deteriorate like this, you know, that folks will listen to you more, that you may run.
[00:52:10.889 --> 00:52:15.890]  I believe you're going to run because you know it's the right thing to do, and we win just by you running, being able to educate people.
[00:52:16.170 --> 00:52:17.130]  Where do you stand on this?
[00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:25.692]  People are chomping at the bit to know, and I saw your quotes in the news saying that you are interested in the Senate polls you've been seeing.
[00:52:27.096 --> 00:52:31.978]  Well, unfortunately, I'm still very ambivalent about all this.
[00:52:32.218 --> 00:52:44.804]  I usually am not ambivalent on my views and what I do and what my plans are, but it does require a major decision, a personal decision, a family decision, a political decision, all of these things.
[00:52:44.824 --> 00:52:45.704]  So I am.
[00:52:45.885 --> 00:52:50.727]  I'm pretty undecided on what to do, and I think it through.
[00:52:50.767 --> 00:52:52.708]  People keep asking me, do you think about doing this?
[00:52:52.888 --> 00:52:54.108]  And I admit it, I do.
[00:52:54.168 --> 00:52:55.269]  I think about it all the time.
[00:52:55.889 --> 00:53:05.220]  Not only because I wonder what I'm going to do the rest of my life, but I often think about it because when I get on radio talk shows, they ask me these kind of questions.
[00:53:05.781 --> 00:53:11.688]  But I'm still pretty undecided on what I should do and what I can do and what I'll end up doing.
[00:53:12.403 --> 00:53:21.271]  Well, I challenged your doctor and now senator's son when he was really just exploring it more than, I guess, a year and a half, two years ago.
[00:53:21.731 --> 00:53:25.374]  And I said, look, Rand, you're going to win just by injecting real ideas.
[00:53:25.434 --> 00:53:26.936]  And I said, I believe you will win.
[00:53:26.956 --> 00:53:31.900]  Because, I mean, I'm no political rocket scientist, but I could look at the field in Kentucky.
[00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:38.206]  I could see the Tea Party movement that your supporters started four years ago, three and a half years ago.
[00:53:38.946 --> 00:53:40.587]  And look, he's there, he's won.
[00:53:40.647 --> 00:53:44.209]  He went through hell, but he's there and he did the right thing for his country and for humanity.
[00:53:45.530 --> 00:53:56.236]  And just as I asked you on-air and off-air before you ran for president very early on, I know many others did, said, Congressman, I know it's rough on your family, the attacks, the physical danger, but I said, you've got to do it.
[00:53:56.656 --> 00:54:05.860]  And you're a man of conscience, a man who has a big heart and who I know from your actions and your fruits, but also my discernment, is the real deal.
[00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:13.323]  I don't think you have any choice but to run for president, or bare minimum, Senate.
[00:54:13.883 --> 00:54:18.746]  And it is your destiny, Congressman Ron Paul, in your almost 40 years of standing up for liberty.
[00:54:19.387 --> 00:54:22.329]  And so I'm drafting you right here, and I know my listeners are.
[00:54:22.349 --> 00:54:31.274]  And if your health holds up, you've taken care of yourself, barring that, I just hope and pray, sir, that you do run for president.
[00:54:31.294 --> 00:54:36.137]  And I think the sooner you announce, the better, so we can get the money and the energy and the grassroots behind you.
[00:54:36.157 --> 00:54:39.660]  And I want you to know you've got my full support of our millions of listeners.
[00:54:40.578 --> 00:54:45.182]  Well, I appreciate the comments.
[00:54:45.722 --> 00:54:48.244]  It's just real difficult.
[00:54:48.304 --> 00:54:59.713]  The one thing I can assure you and all your listeners is that it would be pretty hard for me to pack my bag and go and retire and live quietly
[00:55:00.473 --> 00:55:03.434]  Thereafter, hereafter, and not be involved.
[00:55:03.594 --> 00:55:06.475]  But, regardless, I've been in and out of office.
[00:55:06.575 --> 00:55:07.616]  I've run for offices.
[00:55:07.696 --> 00:55:09.436]  I've won some, lost some, and all that.
[00:55:09.876 --> 00:55:24.342]  One thing is, it would be very hard for me to exist without working diligently to promote our cause, which is the cause of personal liberty and the things that I believe in, because I believe this is how people have an opportunity to
[00:55:25.282 --> 00:55:27.763]  Well we know that, and I mean even if he just did the debates and didn't
[00:55:41.027 --> 00:55:45.729]  Beat yourself to death flying everywhere, even if you did it electronically, which I think is the most effective.
[00:55:45.769 --> 00:55:50.911]  I think a lot of campaigning is outdated with the focus on the individual, you know, getting out there in person.
[00:55:51.991 --> 00:56:02.615]  I mean, even if you did it electronically, and I mean, you've got to run, obviously, because the educational points, but obviously we respect your decision and we'll appreciate you and support you regardless.
[00:56:02.635 --> 00:56:05.476]  But you can see, as Julius Caesar said, there is a
[00:56:05.836 --> 00:56:09.598]  Tied in the affairs of men, when taken at the flood, leads on to fortune.
[00:56:09.858 --> 00:56:15.121]  And the fortune we seek is the jewel of liberty, as Thomas Jefferson said, and that jewel must be guarded jealously.
[00:56:15.361 --> 00:56:17.262]  And you are the great guardian of that jewel.
[00:56:17.282 --> 00:56:20.404]  Of anyone in the world, you are that light standing out like no other.
[00:56:21.004 --> 00:56:23.745]  And I don't think that you're going to not run.
[00:56:23.785 --> 00:56:24.966]  In my gut, I know you are.
[00:56:25.446 --> 00:56:30.129]  And Congressman, we just really, from the bottom of our hearts, want to thank you for the great work you're doing.
[00:56:30.369 --> 00:56:31.969]  We've only got about two or three minutes left.
[00:56:32.070 --> 00:56:34.531]  In closing, taking sides on auditing and then
[00:56:35.211 --> 00:56:36.774]  Reforming, abolishing the Fed.
[00:56:36.794 --> 00:56:42.885]  Where do you stand with your periscope sights on that great warmock?
[00:56:44.246 --> 00:56:53.890]  Well, I'm looking forward to that, and I tried to get a hearing in January, but Congress is still disorganized because it's newly created.
[00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:56.271]  So in February, the hearings are going to start.
[00:56:57.131 --> 00:57:05.074]  I did find out also that the rules prevent me from insisting that Bernanke come before a subcommittee.
[00:57:07.595 --> 00:57:09.997]  And he only comes before a full committee.
[00:57:10.037 --> 00:57:12.578]  That's just the way the rules are, like a Secretary of Treasury, too.
[00:57:12.959 --> 00:57:16.541]  But it doesn't keep me from pursuing all the views that we have to have.
[00:57:16.601 --> 00:57:24.967]  Exposing the Fed, transparency of the Fed, teaching people why the Fed is responsible for the booms and the busts and the unemployment and the inflation.
[00:57:25.527 --> 00:57:27.148]  I mean, it is a hot topic.
[00:57:27.208 --> 00:57:28.389]  It's going to get hotter.
[00:57:29.149 --> 00:57:34.733]  And we're going to have our side well represented and the hearings are not going to be huge.
[00:57:34.773 --> 00:57:37.114]  Sometimes I have six and eight people come for hearings.
[00:57:37.734 --> 00:57:44.318]  Ours will be smaller and they're going to be very deliberative and there's going to be debate going on.
[00:57:44.659 --> 00:57:46.480]  I believe we're going to get a lot of attention.
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:52.805]  I think we can achieve a whole lot by this, especially as we move into this crisis.
[00:57:53.185 --> 00:57:59.310]  Because then, once we expose the Fed, then we better start talking about a transition and how we get out of this.
[00:57:59.851 --> 00:58:06.296]  Already, you know, the opposition, those at the World Bank, talked about, yeah, we might have to have a new currency.
[00:58:06.316 --> 00:58:07.717]  Maybe we ought to use a little bit of gold.
[00:58:08.097 --> 00:58:11.600]  So they want to neutralize us a little bit, but they want to control everything.
[00:58:12.841 --> 00:58:13.961]  That's going to be our challenge.
[00:58:13.981 --> 00:58:16.602]  What are we going to replace this system with?
[00:58:16.642 --> 00:58:19.103]  And that's something I'll be working very hard on.
[00:58:19.143 --> 00:58:21.103]  Well, Congressman, as you know, we're here at the crisis.
[00:58:21.123 --> 00:58:22.964]  They're going to try to use it to get even more power.
[00:58:23.024 --> 00:58:24.344]  We've got to deal with it now.
[00:58:24.384 --> 00:58:26.885]  And there you are, historically, at the perfect time and perfect place.
[00:58:27.285 --> 00:58:29.686]  Have a great weekend coming up, Congressman Ron Paul.
[00:58:29.986 --> 00:58:31.106]  And we'll talk to you again soon.
[00:58:31.146 --> 00:58:31.867]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:58:32.007 --> 00:58:32.327]  Thank you.
[00:58:32.347 --> 00:58:32.947]  Good to talk to you.
[00:58:32.967 --> 00:58:33.887]  Good to talk to you.
[00:58:33.927 --> 00:58:36.588]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:58:36.788 --> 00:58:39.169]  Don't forget, the V for Victory campaign launched today.
[00:58:40.407 --> 00:58:42.208]  The GCN Radio Network.
[00:58:42.448 --> 00:58:45.070]  Providing the world with hard-hitting talk radio.
[00:58:45.350 --> 00:58:47.171]  GCN.
[00:58:47.711 --> 00:58:49.913]  Great talk radio starts here.
[00:58:51.627 --> 00:58:55.251]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:58:55.651 --> 00:58:58.655]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:58:58.895 --> 00:59:03.680]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:59:03.700 --> 00:59:09.927]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:59:10.087 --> 00:59:12.330]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:59:12.850 --> 00:59:13.130]  Tim Geithner?
[00:59:13.170 --> 00:59:13.590]  Bernanke?
[00:59:13.670 --> 00:59:14.291]  They're arsonists!
[00:59:14.351 --> 00:59:15.611]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:59:15.631 --> 00:59:17.872]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:59:31.758 --> 00:59:33.599]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:59:33.619 --> 00:59:38.703]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:59:39.044 --> 00:59:48.991]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[01:00:05.168 --> 01:00:09.349]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.989 --> 01:00:10.810]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.590 --> 01:00:12.530]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.130 --> 01:00:16.811]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.332 --> 01:00:21.393]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:26.941]  It's V-Day on the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:27.481 --> 01:00:31.123]  Here's the second hour with me, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:00:31.643 --> 01:00:37.965]  And of course, Joel Skousen will be hosting in the third hour, so be sure to stay tuned for that.
[01:00:38.826 --> 01:00:39.006]  Now...
[01:00:40.680 --> 01:01:02.883]  Today sees the launch of our new campaign, you are the resistance, resistance is victory, and of course we're going with the classic historical archetype V symbol of resistance as part of this video and flyer campaign that Alex is launching today.
[01:01:03.991 --> 01:01:15.634]  Now, Homeland Security has announced its total takeover of society with the video messages at Walmart checkouts ordering Americans to report on each other.
[01:01:15.654 --> 01:01:25.637]  And now we know that these are being expanded to sports stadiums, shopping malls and other places within your community across the nation.
[01:01:26.977 --> 01:01:36.127]  Now yesterday we posted also the billboard, Homeland Security is now ordering Americans where they can and can't park their vehicle.
[01:01:36.908 --> 01:01:48.741]  So we've officially launched our V for Victory campaign to let big sis know that we're not going to tolerate the DHS invasion of America.
[01:01:50.086 --> 01:02:04.668]  Now, the historical foundation of this V symbol campaign, of which you can download the flyers on prisonplanet.com right now, has nothing to do with V for Vendetta, the movie.
[01:02:06.164 --> 01:02:19.398]  It's launched within the spirit of the French resistance who expressed their solidarity and defiance when France was invaded and occupied by the Nazis during World War II.
[01:02:20.119 --> 01:02:23.102]  Now, Alex touched on this a little bit earlier.
[01:02:23.363 --> 01:02:26.766]  The confluence of events that created this campaign
[01:02:28.408 --> 01:02:31.329]  Came as Alex was already preparing to launch.
[01:02:31.949 --> 01:02:36.271]  The answer to 1984 is 1776 campaign.
[01:02:36.851 --> 01:02:40.212]  Details of which are going up imminently on Infowars.com.
[01:02:41.813 --> 01:02:51.056]  And then I had the idea to incorporate the V resistance symbol within that campaign that Alex was already preparing to launch.
[01:02:51.997 --> 01:02:52.277]  Because
[01:02:53.217 --> 01:03:05.614]  The historical archetype of the French Resistance as a whole is a powerful undercurrent of the message of freedom that continues to vibrate through the generations.
[01:03:06.997 --> 01:03:28.544]  Now my personal interest was really piqued when my parents recently moved into their new house in France which was built in the 1860s and we subsequently found out that it was inhabited by French resistance rebels who were active in the Isere region of France during the Second World War which was a particularly
[01:03:31.209 --> 01:03:37.554]  Rich region for resistance against the Nazis in the latter stages of the Second World War.
[01:03:38.075 --> 01:03:49.264]  But on top of that, when I visited my parents at Christmas, we went for a walk in the forest behind their house and we stumbled upon this huge derelict chateau.
[01:03:49.944 --> 01:03:58.632]  In the middle of the woods, which we later discovered was in fact another headquarters for the French resistance leadership in the area.
[01:03:58.652 --> 01:04:05.419]  And it was basically situated not much more than a stone's throw from where my parents live, and having lived there for
[01:04:06.159 --> 01:04:10.684]  Many months now, they weren't even aware of it until we just stumbled across it.
[01:04:11.064 --> 01:04:24.257]  And it turns out that the reason behind this chateau being derelict is because the French resistance leaders who were headquartered inside it were burned alive when the Nazis torched the house in 1944.
[01:04:28.362 --> 01:04:44.253]  So to have, you know, such a visceral piece of history in the woods behind my parents' house obviously encouraged me to begin a deeper study of the French Resistance, which is eventually what led to the idea for this V for Victory campaign.
[01:04:44.593 --> 01:04:46.294]  So we'll get into this more after the break.
[01:04:46.314 --> 01:04:47.715]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:04:48.296 --> 01:04:50.257]  Wayne Madsen coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[01:04:50.537 --> 01:04:52.158]  Stay tuned at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:05:00.555 --> 01:05:02.137]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.

[01:05:52.892 --> 01:05:53.713]  Thank you!
[01:06:00.009 --> 01:06:04.252]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:06:04.572 --> 01:06:05.173]  Number one.
[01:06:05.473 --> 01:06:08.635]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:06:08.896 --> 01:06:09.476]  Number two.
[01:06:09.776 --> 01:06:14.320]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:15.100]  It's true.
[01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:19.964]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:06:20.284 --> 01:06:20.824]  Number three.
[01:06:21.105 --> 01:06:24.387]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:06:24.687 --> 01:06:28.390]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:06:28.590 --> 01:06:29.131]  Number 4.
[01:06:29.371 --> 01:06:31.753]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:06:32.134 --> 01:06:35.537]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:06:35.818 --> 01:06:36.038]  Number 5.
[01:06:36.618 --> 01:06:40.543]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:06:40.763 --> 01:06:45.528]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:06:45.808 --> 01:06:49.831]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:49.971 --> 01:06:51.533]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:06:59.859 --> 01:07:03.642]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[01:07:03.702 --> 01:07:07.745]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[01:07:07.985 --> 01:07:12.769]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:14.591]  I'm looking for a factory
[01:07:15.351 --> 01:07:25.702]  Where a man can feed his family Not worried about them moving south Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow
[01:07:28.408 --> 01:07:33.871]  I'm looking for America.
[01:07:33.931 --> 01:07:35.772]  We're American and be proud.
[01:07:35.892 --> 01:07:38.073]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[01:07:38.153 --> 01:07:42.355]  The land I left free and the home of the brave.
[01:07:42.775 --> 01:07:46.416]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[01:07:54.338 --> 01:07:58.980]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[01:08:01.901 --> 01:08:07.924]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.524 --> 01:08:11.526]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:14.887 --> 01:08:21.049]  Welcome back to V-Day on the Alex Jones Show on this 21st of January 2011.
[01:08:21.890 --> 01:08:38.316]  We've officially launched the V for Victory resistance campaign today at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com and we're encouraging InfoWarriors worldwide, not just in America, to join us in posting these flyers everywhere
[01:08:39.096 --> 01:08:46.241]  As a powerful symbol of our defiance against the takeover of society by the new world order.
[01:08:46.841 --> 01:08:55.447]  And why is it necessary to invoke the spirit of the French resistance to make a point about 21st century America?
[01:08:56.568 --> 01:09:01.772]  Because not just in America or the United Kingdom, but the West as a whole,
[01:09:02.975 --> 01:09:15.124]  is on this same slippery slide towards the very same informant, spy, starzy societies that were set up by the Nazis and the Soviets both in Russia and the former East Germany.
[01:09:16.645 --> 01:09:25.271]  Homeland Security is telling Americans to spy on each other to create an environment of fear so that they can then exploit it for total control.
[01:09:27.506 --> 01:09:30.048]  Why is that important in the context of history?
[01:09:30.348 --> 01:09:41.795]  Well, show me a case in history where the government recruiting citizens to spy on each other led to a more secure, happy, free and prosperous society.
[01:09:42.015 --> 01:09:45.778]  Show me one example and I'll show you a chicken with teeth.
[01:09:47.298 --> 01:09:56.452]  You know, best case scenario, what's now happening in America leads to political oppression and dissidents being jailed as it did in East Germany.
[01:09:56.952 --> 01:10:01.078]  Worst case scenario leads to death camps, as in Nazi Germany.
[01:10:02.918 --> 01:10:12.862]  Many of the French resistance fighters in Paris and France as a whole were shipped off to those very same death camps for expressing their resistance against occupation.
[01:10:13.322 --> 01:10:26.527]  And now we invoke their spirit, their symbol of the V for victory in our resistance campaign against the takeover of our society, which is in many ways more insidious than
[01:10:27.327 --> 01:10:30.489]  Black boot-wearing, storm-trooping Nazis.
[01:10:30.669 --> 01:10:41.494]  At least the French could see who their oppressors were, whereas in modern-day America, the government simply indoctrinates the American citizens to become each other's oppressors.
[01:10:41.854 --> 01:10:49.818]  We had the article a few weeks ago of the father who fed his daughter with organic food, prevented his children from having vaccines.
[01:10:50.359 --> 01:10:53.160]  His neighbours reported him as a potential terrorist.
[01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:55.381]  See something, say something.
[01:10:55.421 --> 01:10:56.682]  This is where it's all heading.
[01:10:58.430 --> 01:11:11.310]  Now I've written, again getting back to the historical foundation of this, where it's all coming from, I've written many times about the study of Robert Glately from Florida University.
[01:11:12.734 --> 01:11:36.027]  And he found that the common misconception about Nazi Germany and how it built up as this totalitarian state from the 30s onwards, a common misconception was that the Gestapo investigations came from the top, when in fact he found that 80% of Gestapo investigations of so-called political dissidents in Nazi Germany
[01:11:37.248 --> 01:11:41.491]  Came from what they called denunciations by ordinary German citizens.
[01:11:41.711 --> 01:11:44.774]  So 80% of the cases were from informants.
[01:11:47.193 --> 01:11:53.179]  There were relatively few secret police, wrote Galately, and most were just processing the information coming in.
[01:11:53.740 --> 01:11:55.682]  I had found a shocking fact.
[01:11:55.822 --> 01:12:01.488]  It wasn't the secret police who were doing this wide-scale surveillance and hiding on every street corner.
[01:12:01.948 --> 01:12:06.113]  It was the ordinary German people who were informing on their neighbours.
[01:12:06.693 --> 01:12:07.074]  And now...
[01:12:07.734 --> 01:12:10.837]  What is Homeland Security telling Americans to do?
[01:12:11.337 --> 01:12:23.107]  Walmart checkout counters report suspicious activity in a program that's now been expanded to 9,000 shopping malls, sports stadiums, different buildings around the country.
[01:12:24.542 --> 01:12:29.064]  And what else did Galately find in his study of informant societies in Nazi Germany?
[01:12:30.005 --> 01:12:44.872]  He found that people were motivated to inform on their neighbours, friends and colleagues, not through any genuine concern for security, which is how Homeland Security pitches it, but through banal factors like, quote, greed, jealousy and petty differences.
[01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:57.515]  Quote, history tells us that any Stasi-like society does nothing to increase genuine security and only turns the host population against each other while decaying the country from within.
[01:12:57.535 --> 01:13:06.700]  And you can read about that study in the article we posted today announcing the launch of the V for Victory contest.
[01:13:10.982 --> 01:13:28.965]  Also in Nazi Germany we had cases where people will be financially rewarded for informing on their neighbours and we've wrote several articles over the past few years where in fact now local authorities in America are doing precisely that, giving people cash bonuses for turning in their friends and neighbours.
[01:13:30.066 --> 01:13:40.956]  And Homeland Security has embarked on the very same thing with their announcement that they're now looking for the general public to give them PSAs that promote this very starzy spy program.
[01:13:40.996 --> 01:13:48.142]  So they're openly handing out cash bonuses for the American public to promote their fear-mongering agenda.
[01:13:50.979 --> 01:13:58.141]  So, the interesting thing to this whole campaign is, of course, what it's based on generating, which is a reaction.
[01:13:59.602 --> 01:14:07.844]  You know, will the neolib, statist, Obama, Borg, Hive blogs and their allies in the establishment media
[01:14:09.745 --> 01:14:13.126]  Demonised this as they did the Obama Joker campaign.
[01:14:13.567 --> 01:14:14.527]  As racist.
[01:14:14.627 --> 01:14:16.768]  You know, they tried to say it was vandalism.
[01:14:17.168 --> 01:14:21.970]  They labelled it, the LA Times did, as an act of cultural terrorism.
[01:14:22.971 --> 01:14:27.672]  When, you know, getting it down to breast tax, it was a mere poster campaign!
[01:14:29.473 --> 01:14:38.497]  And compare it to Shepard Fairey's pro-Obama poster campaign, which elicited no condemnation from the establishment whatsoever.
[01:14:40.191 --> 01:14:57.762]  It shows you how petrified the establishment is of a mere poster campaign, of merely the slaves standing up and saying that they are the resistance and they will not tolerate this endless fealty as a march of big government accelerates.
[01:14:59.503 --> 01:15:01.244]  But this is bigger than Obama.
[01:15:01.864 --> 01:15:14.188]  It's about sending a symbolic message of defiance to those who believe that they have the divine right to micromanage every facet of our lives while turning Americans against each other.
[01:15:14.829 --> 01:15:18.670]  You know, now they're trying to ban the incandescent light bulb.
[01:15:18.930 --> 01:15:25.993]  I mean, for God's sake, if they can ban a light bulb, if they can ban you from purchasing a light bulb, they can basically order you to do anything.
[01:15:27.341 --> 01:15:29.742]  And it's not just about homeland security either.
[01:15:31.543 --> 01:15:35.784]  This March of Authoritarianism is global in its reach, as you well know.
[01:15:36.504 --> 01:15:46.308]  So whether you're in the United Kingdom, America, Europe or wherever, you can get involved in this campaign and the message is universal, that you are the resistance.
[01:15:46.968 --> 01:15:48.589]  Which is what's printed on the flyers.
[01:15:50.430 --> 01:15:51.030]  And it's about
[01:15:52.179 --> 01:15:57.823]  You know, getting beyond the powerlessness, the inferiority complex, the pessimism.
[01:15:59.164 --> 01:16:14.876]  The occupied French, the French Resistance, knew that they were living in tyranny and the vast majority of them became frustrated at this same feeling of hopelessness and powerlessness that many of the listeners and the readers of our websites feel today.
[01:16:16.057 --> 01:16:19.219]  But as we quoted from Matthew Cobb's book,
[01:16:20.506 --> 01:16:37.698]  About the French Resistance, which I'm reading at the moment, quote, the V campaign meant ordinary people could feel they were doing something however symbolic to protest against the occupation.
[01:16:40.407 --> 01:17:01.614]  And that's why the French in Paris and other occupied areas spent their time scrawling, spray-painting, posting up this V symbol, which was later used in several movies, television series, right up until the past couple of years, as this universal, historic symbol of resistance.
[01:17:02.814 --> 01:17:25.325]  So, instead of, you know, sitting in front of your computer screens, leaving negative, pointless comments about how we're all doomed, about how we can't do anything, and, you know, wallowing in your own lack of self-respect, as some still do on a regular basis, why not actually try and join in on this V for Victory campaign?
[01:17:27.264 --> 01:17:36.848]  You know, why not stop, just for a moment, justifying your own apathy and laziness by telling yourself, you know, that peaceful action can't achieve change?
[01:17:36.888 --> 01:17:41.910]  And remember that there are countless examples throughout history where it has done exactly that.
[01:17:44.505 --> 01:18:00.834]  Not only with the French Resistance, but, you know, if Martin Luther King would just have, you know, been laying about moaning about how you can't change anything without guns and bombs, would black people still be getting hosed by water cannons and sitting at the back of the bus?
[01:18:02.815 --> 01:18:04.496]  You know, Emily Pankhurst.
[01:18:05.337 --> 01:18:06.357]  Pick whoever you want.
[01:18:06.598 --> 01:18:06.958]  Did she
[01:18:08.618 --> 01:18:13.960]  Write letters about the futility of attempting to change anything or did she stand up and get the job done?
[01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:28.124]  You know, hiding out in your shack and claiming you're part of some militia when in reality you spend your time on message boards attacking anyone that bothers to do something just doesn't cut it anymore.
[01:18:30.304 --> 01:18:31.645]  People try to denigrate
[01:18:33.012 --> 01:18:44.182]  The simple action of this campaign and ones like it, like the Obama Joker campaign, which was a massive success, which is why the establishment had to demonize it to such a degree.
[01:18:46.291 --> 01:18:53.717]  The reason why this is important, I mean, why do you think Homeland Security feels the need to put up their posters?
[01:18:54.538 --> 01:18:56.940]  To put up their telescreens in Walmart?
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:04.826]  And their messages with Janet Napolitano, big sis, telling us to live in a constant state of fear.
[01:19:04.886 --> 01:19:05.787]  Why do they do it?
[01:19:06.527 --> 01:19:08.729]  If it has no effect, why do they do it?
[01:19:10.530 --> 01:19:14.414]  Because it indoctrinates and coerces obedience from the general public.
[01:19:15.482 --> 01:19:18.504]  Our tactics are no different from Homeland Security.
[01:19:19.145 --> 01:19:23.148]  The only difference is that their method of indoctrination is fear.
[01:19:24.349 --> 01:19:34.076]  Our method of indoctrination is freedom and, you know, reasserting ourselves as free-thinking individuals who refuse to be cowed by fear.
[01:19:35.137 --> 01:19:43.404]  Which is the fear of expressing our right to dissent because we dread the consequences of the local tattletale reporting us to Big Sis!
[01:19:43.704 --> 01:19:46.406]  This is what the V campaign is all about.
[01:19:46.446 --> 01:19:47.447]  We'll be right back.
[01:19:47.527 --> 01:19:52.111]  Stay tuned for more on the Alex Jones Show live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:19:52.171 --> 01:19:52.732]  Don't go away.

[01:20:18.618 --> 01:20:22.300]  Totally Wicked e-liquid cigarettes have a battery charge that lasts up to 8 hours.

[01:20:56.020 --> 01:20:58.242]  The next generation of alternative smoking.
[01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:06.362]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:21:06.823 --> 01:21:14.606]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:21:14.946 --> 01:21:22.789]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:21:23.109 --> 01:21:27.872]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:21:28.192 --> 01:21:32.914]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:21:33.415 --> 01:21:37.277]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:21:37.777 --> 01:21:38.778]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:21:38.858 --> 01:21:42.880]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:47.722]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[01:21:48.242 --> 01:21:50.823]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[01:21:51.244 --> 01:21:52.904]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:53.024 --> 01:21:53.244]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:59.267 --> 01:22:00.408]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:22:00.448 --> 01:22:07.153]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:22:07.413 --> 01:22:09.715]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:22:09.975 --> 01:22:15.179]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:22:15.379 --> 01:22:18.181]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:22:18.321 --> 01:22:20.443]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:22:20.663 --> 01:22:26.627]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:22:26.947 --> 01:22:30.170]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:22:30.330 --> 01:22:35.894]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:22:36.154 --> 01:22:37.475]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:22:37.815 --> 01:22:38.976]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:22:39.116 --> 01:22:41.678]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:22:41.798 --> 01:22:43.219]  He explains everything you need to know,
[01:22:43.479 --> 01:22:45.863]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:22:46.023 --> 01:22:58.042]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com That's End of America, the number 3.com Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com That's EndOfAmerica3.com
[01:22:59.033 --> 01:23:02.314]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[01:23:03.114 --> 01:23:07.355]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[01:23:07.615 --> 01:23:13.536]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[01:23:13.776 --> 01:23:15.917]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[01:23:16.197 --> 01:23:22.178]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[01:23:22.298 --> 01:23:25.641]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[01:23:25.701 --> 01:23:27.402]  There is no other program of its kind.
[01:23:27.583 --> 01:23:29.624]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[01:23:29.764 --> 01:23:34.429]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.
[01:23:34.629 --> 01:23:35.269]  Guaranteed.

[01:24:10.494 --> 01:24:19.099]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, January 21st, 2011.
[01:24:19.139 --> 01:24:22.621]  It's the launch of the V for Victory campaign.
[01:24:23.021 --> 01:24:26.323]  Download your flyers now at PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:24:26.864 --> 01:24:38.410]  Now we've got the Google search terms for today, and these are the terms that will push our article on this V for Victory campaign right to the top of Google Trends, which will then make
[01:24:39.671 --> 01:24:44.513]  Other news publications, blogs and websites write about this campaign.
[01:24:44.553 --> 01:24:49.455]  It gets it out to the wider internet audience that goes beyond our own websites.
[01:24:49.975 --> 01:24:51.375]  Here are the Google search terms.
[01:24:51.896 --> 01:24:53.676]  You are the resistance.
[01:24:54.317 --> 01:24:56.317]  You are the resistance.
[01:24:57.078 --> 01:24:57.878]  That's number one.
[01:24:58.518 --> 01:24:59.138]  Number two.
[01:24:59.899 --> 01:25:01.699]  Occupation of America.
[01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:04.861]  That's Occupation of America.
[01:25:06.121 --> 01:25:09.943]  Google search term number three is V for Victory.
[01:25:09.963 --> 01:25:12.644]  That's V for Victory.
[01:25:12.664 --> 01:25:33.252]  Hit Google with those terms over the course of today and inevitably, as they always do, they will rise to the top of Google Trends and not just our websites but anybody else who chooses to write about the campaign will get the traffic and more people will find out about this V for Victory campaign.
[01:25:35.154 --> 01:25:37.895]  Now, what's the reaction going to be?
[01:25:37.915 --> 01:25:43.936]  You saw the reaction with the Obama Joker poster campaign, which was basically blind panic!
[01:25:44.977 --> 01:25:52.899]  Which shows you how afraid of the people joining together and simply asserting their freedom the establishment really is.
[01:25:54.298 --> 01:26:07.392]  By putting these V-symbols everywhere, it becomes a potent display of our power, our effectiveness to influence the collective unconsciousness and literally change minds and society for the better.
[01:26:07.793 --> 01:26:09.294]  Homeland Security does it!
[01:26:10.823 --> 01:26:15.285]  If it was worthless and had no effect, why are they putting telescreens in Walmart?
[01:26:15.665 --> 01:26:18.907]  Because they're trying to coerce obedience out of people.
[01:26:19.287 --> 01:26:21.848]  They're trying to change society for the worse.
[01:26:22.288 --> 01:26:29.352]  We're gonna use the exact same tactics, but in the spirit of freedom, in the spirit of the French Resistance.
[01:26:30.992 --> 01:26:31.593]  And there's another.
[01:26:32.771 --> 01:26:45.556]  Reason why V for Victory, why our campaign is infinitely more powerful than theirs, than see something, say something, snitch on your neighbor.
[01:26:45.936 --> 01:26:52.138]  And it's because our approach is based on the solid bedrock of historical resistance to tyranny.
[01:26:52.558 --> 01:26:56.860]  You know, it's based on everything that America is supposed to stand for.
[01:26:57.987 --> 01:27:08.575]  Their whole approach is based on a contrived fraud that through endless repetition and mind control they've hoaxed millions of Americans into believing.
[01:27:09.096 --> 01:27:12.919]  You know, just like reds under the bed or weapons of mass destruction.
[01:27:13.519 --> 01:27:16.702]  And that is, of course, the fear of terrorism.
[01:27:18.263 --> 01:27:39.435]  Now, I routinely refer to the report of Ohio University's John Muller, who wrote a white paper called, A False Sense of Insecurity, in which he writes, quote, For all the attention it evokes, terrorism actually causes rather little damage, and the likelihood that any individual will become a victim in most places is microscopic.
[01:27:41.638 --> 01:27:49.482]  And I compiled a list several years ago in this article of some things that are more likely to kill Americans than terrorists.
[01:27:49.842 --> 01:27:50.182]  Okay?
[01:27:50.982 --> 01:27:52.643]  Here's a little list for you.
[01:27:53.944 --> 01:28:00.007]  And this is why the DHS fear campaign is completely ridiculous and debunked on the face of it.
[01:28:00.707 --> 01:28:06.249]  Peanut allergies every single year kill more Americans than terrorists.
[01:28:07.190 --> 01:28:09.111]  Accident-causing deer
[01:28:10.658 --> 01:28:13.542]  Every single year, kill more Americans than terrorists.
[01:28:13.602 --> 01:28:16.987]  Of course, the deer could be with Al-Qaeda, that's yet to be confirmed.
[01:28:17.848 --> 01:28:19.891]  Okay, drowning with swimming pools.
[01:28:20.914 --> 01:28:27.977]  All of these things individually cause more deaths of Americans per year than any act of terrorism per year, on average.
[01:28:28.637 --> 01:28:28.978]  Okay?
[01:28:29.338 --> 01:28:33.840]  Lightning strikes kill more people, more Americans, than terrorists.
[01:28:34.380 --> 01:28:43.084]  Yeah, we don't live in constant fear of accident-causing deer and peanut allergies and drowning in swimming pools.
[01:28:43.104 --> 01:28:47.586]  There aren't constant announcements at Walmart about the Al-Qaeda deer coming to kill us all.
[01:28:49.122 --> 01:28:51.813]  Yet they always claim more lives than terrorists.
[01:28:54.198 --> 01:29:21.130]  And what's even more ludicrous about how the DHS exploits this fear, which is completely contrived and a massive hoax, is that in their most recent PSA about, you know, terrorists targeting hotels, they even go to the lengths to point out that, you know, Martha's five-bedroom bed and breakfast out in the middle of nowhere is also a primary target for Osama bin Laden.
[01:29:22.401 --> 01:29:27.901]  You know, good old Martha's more likely to get struck by lightning than she is killed by a terrorist.
[01:29:28.513 --> 01:29:37.995]  Yeah, they come out with this ridiculous assertion that people's little B&Bs are going to get targeted by Bin Laden, which is why Americans need to report on their neighbours.
[01:29:38.655 --> 01:29:41.396]  So the very foundation of it is a mass hoax.
[01:29:41.456 --> 01:29:45.817]  We'll be back after the break with Wayne Madsen to talk about Rahm Emanuel.
[01:29:45.877 --> 01:29:47.357]  It's the Alex Jones Show live.
[01:29:47.757 --> 01:29:50.037]  Stay tuned, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:29:50.758 --> 01:29:51.658]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.158 --> 01:29:53.758]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.778 --> 01:29:57.379]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.757 --> 01:30:04.061]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[01:30:04.341 --> 01:30:05.422]  It ended on June of 2009.
[01:30:05.642 --> 01:30:09.826]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[01:30:10.027 --> 01:30:15.693]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[01:30:15.973 --> 01:30:17.955]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[01:30:18.135 --> 01:30:20.798]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[01:30:21.158 --> 01:30:27.461]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.

[01:30:53.232 --> 01:30:53.852]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:30:53.892 --> 01:30:57.913]  citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:30:57.953 --> 01:31:00.314]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:31:10.737 --> 01:31:15.919]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:31:16.119 --> 01:31:18.901]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:31:19.161 --> 01:31:21.282]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:31:21.482 --> 01:31:27.404]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:31:27.725 --> 01:31:30.926]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:31:31.106 --> 01:31:36.629]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:31:36.889 --> 01:31:38.189]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:31:38.529 --> 01:31:39.670]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:31:39.810 --> 01:31:42.371]  You should at least watch this free video online today.

[01:33:10.852 --> 01:33:12.693]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:12.733 --> 01:33:17.114]  We've got Joel Skousen coming up in the final hour to host the final hour of the show.
[01:33:17.154 --> 01:33:18.615]  Be sure to stay tuned for that.
[01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:50.778]  Now we welcome one of our frequent contributors, and that is former US Navy vet, of course he worked with the NSA, and now investigative journalist, Wayne Madsen, whose excellent reports you can read at waynemadsenreport.com.
[01:33:50.878 --> 01:33:52.721]  Hello Wayne, welcome to the show today.
[01:33:52.741 --> 01:33:54.483]  Hi, good to be with you.
[01:33:55.919 --> 01:34:22.198]  Now, before we talk about Rahm Emanuel, which I wanted to cover, I just wanted to get your take on the historical foundation of resistance movements in general, because we've been talking about the launch of our new campaign today, V for Victory, which is a throwback to how the French Resistance used the symbol of the V sign to express their defiance against being occupied by the Nazis during World War II.
[01:34:22.759 --> 01:34:23.720]  And I was reading that
[01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:31.022]  Your grandmother was actually a leader in the Danish resistance movement fighting the Nazis at the same time.
[01:34:31.702 --> 01:34:53.508]  And now that America is heading the way of all tyrannical empires with this DHS announcement, you know, encouraging people to report on each other, I just wanted you to speak to the historical role of collective resistance movements from your knowledge concerning the involvement of your grandmother in the resistance against the Nazis.
[01:34:54.321 --> 01:34:55.163]  Oh, right.
[01:34:55.263 --> 01:35:01.633]  My grandmother, Victoria Mattson, she was a novelist and a journalist in Denmark.
[01:35:03.158 --> 01:35:18.228]  After the Nazis invaded, of course, she went into the underground, the resistance movement, and actively attacked German troops inside the country.
[01:35:18.348 --> 01:35:24.752]  Also was very instrumental in getting about 7,000 Danish Jews and any other
[01:35:26.812 --> 01:35:53.843]  person uh... jewish and otherwise to the gestapo was after who could make it to denmark of course they were uh... they were uh... secreted away on danish fishing boats and uh... found refuge in sweden so she was involved in a lot of those efforts and of course uh... after the war she came over to the united states uh... she was very active in the labor movement and in nineteen forty eight she wound up apparently on the fbi's
[01:35:54.757 --> 01:36:08.707]  Uh, Liz, uh, J. Edgar Hoover took an interest in her and then, of course, uh, you know, and this is in the days of the Red Scaret, she found herself deported, uh, back to Canada from where she entered the United States originally.
[01:36:09.208 --> 01:36:10.909]  Never came back to this country after that.
[01:36:12.878 --> 01:36:20.445]  That's fascinating, given the context of what we're discussing today with the launch of this new V for Victory campaign.
[01:36:22.167 --> 01:36:27.452]  Moving on to our main topic of discussion, which is Obama's Chief of Staff, of course, Rahm Emanuel.
[01:36:28.553 --> 01:36:38.236]  We're limited with time today, but yesterday on Prison Planet we posted the lengthy interview you did, Wayne, with the reality report on this subject.
[01:36:38.276 --> 01:36:47.319]  So I invite people to check out that video in the multimedia section of Prison Planet for further in-depth conversations on this subject.
[01:36:48.140 --> 01:36:48.760]  Let's start
[01:36:49.480 --> 01:37:04.930]  With the very first thing I learned about Rombo, as he's known, Rom Emmanuel, which was when he was appointed Obama's Chief of Staff in November 2008, and this relates to Emmanuel's family and his background.
[01:37:05.511 --> 01:37:07.852]  Now, Rom's father certainly had...
[01:37:09.173 --> 01:37:17.702]  Shall we say a colourful background, which is very interesting if you're a belief that, you know, the apple doesn't fall very far from the tree.
[01:37:18.303 --> 01:37:23.889]  So, Wayne, tell us about Rahm Emanuel's father and what he was involved with.
[01:37:25.074 --> 01:37:41.449]  Well, we first heard in the media here about his father, Benjamin Emanuel, when after Rahm was appointed Chief of Staff, they asked his father about the influence his son would have in the Obama White House, and he said, well, my son
[01:37:42.089 --> 01:37:45.532]  Not going to be an Arab cleaning woman.
[01:37:45.813 --> 01:37:47.394]  He's Chief of Staff.
[01:37:47.774 --> 01:37:54.600]  Of course, we didn't really get much in the way of an apology from either Benjamin Emanuel or Rahm Emanuel.
[01:37:55.721 --> 01:38:02.908]  Oh, I think Rahm Emanuel said he regretted his father's comments, but no apology even though that was an absolutely racist thing for
[01:38:03.508 --> 01:38:04.849]  For the father to say.
[01:38:05.889 --> 01:38:09.390]  But this gets into what I said on the interview.
[01:38:09.430 --> 01:38:13.812]  What we have in the Emanuel family, and certainly not just Benjamin the father.
[01:38:13.892 --> 01:38:32.940]  Now Benjamin the father, I should point out, fought with the Jewish terrorist organization, the Irgun, in what was then the British Mandate of Palestine, and was very much involved in the blowing up of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, which killed
[01:38:34.541 --> 01:38:42.585]  The British troops and officials, Arab Palestinians and Jewish Palestinians, with an indiscriminate terrorist bombing.
[01:38:43.185 --> 01:38:54.171]  But I was told by somebody whose father was a member of the British forces in Palestine at the time that Benjamin Emmanuel was a highly wanted person by the Brits.
[01:38:54.873 --> 01:38:56.955]  Because his specialty was buses.
[01:38:57.935 --> 01:39:01.238]  Not driving them, not preparing them, but blowing them up.
[01:39:01.318 --> 01:39:07.142]  Especially buses packed with British military and police officers in Palestine.
[01:39:07.522 --> 01:39:13.286]  So this is what you, you know, as you say, it's not only the apple.
[01:39:13.386 --> 01:39:16.909]  Rahm didn't fall too far from the tree, but you know, he's got these two brothers.
[01:39:17.389 --> 01:39:19.811]  One is this super agent, Ari Emanuel.
[01:39:20.291 --> 01:39:24.354]  Who apparently is a real S.O.P., known as an S.O.P.
[01:39:24.394 --> 01:39:24.935]  in Hollywood.
[01:39:25.295 --> 01:39:35.442]  And his other brother, Ezekiel Emanuel, seconded from the National Institute of Health to help come up with the Obama health care program at the White House.
[01:39:35.522 --> 01:39:49.012]  And of course, you know, there's a lot of rhetoric about Obamacare, but apparently Ezekiel Emanuel does favor some, apparently some form of rationing and, you know,
[01:39:50.297 --> 01:40:00.800]  Uh, euthanasia, uh, if that seems to be the only way to go to prevent a lot of money being spent on somebody who obviously would be, you know, terminally ill anyway.
[01:40:01.081 --> 01:40:05.462]  You know, prolonging their life would be expensive under this health care program.
[01:40:05.482 --> 01:40:11.744]  So, the father, Benjamin Emanuel, was a pediatrician in Chicago after he came over here from Israel.
[01:40:12.304 --> 01:40:17.766]  And in the late 60s, there's a report in the Chicago Tribune that one of the women in his care
[01:40:19.006 --> 01:40:22.367]  Could not find a hospital on a Saturday.
[01:40:22.427 --> 01:40:47.553]  Apparently Benjamin Emanuel was doing other things on Saturday and the baby was born in a car looking for a maternity ward and the baby died because of a lack of the doctor, the attending physician, who in this case was Benjamin Emanuel, getting involved to get that woman, get that mother to a hospital as soon as possible.
[01:40:49.764 --> 01:40:55.428]  I mean, it's amazing, going back to what you said about his Ergun terrorist ties.
[01:40:55.448 --> 01:41:13.859]  I mean, this was the group that... Isn't it true that they worked with the infamous Stern Gang, and that they were also involved in the Deir Yassin massacre, which was April 1948, which involved house-to-house slaughtering of Palestinian villagers?
[01:41:13.879 --> 01:41:15.440]  Right, absolutely.
[01:41:16.921 --> 01:41:17.822]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:41:18.202 --> 01:41:20.404]  Absolutely, that's also the case.
[01:41:20.484 --> 01:41:28.792]  And as I say, I think what you've got with the Emanuel family, it's like the kosher version of the Sopranos.
[01:41:29.072 --> 01:41:39.181]  And the reason I think we've seen one after another mayoral candidate drop out in Chicago is probably a lot of strong-arming behind the scenes.
[01:41:40.021 --> 01:41:41.923]  What are we left with in the field?
[01:41:41.963 --> 01:41:51.610]  We're left with former Senator Carol Moseley Braun, who really nobody really thinks... I mean, they would not want her either, really, as Mayor of Chicago.
[01:41:51.990 --> 01:41:56.134]  A couple of Hispanic American candidates, and that's about it.
[01:41:56.294 --> 01:42:04.080]  And the people in Chicago say, wait a minute, but the most of the people in the city despise Rahm Emanuel, the only people who seem to support him.
[01:42:04.500 --> 01:42:04.801]  I don't
[01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:37.796]  Uh, many, there's many Assyrian, uh, Christians up there from Iraq originally, who actually thought, based on his last name, hey, he might be, you know, maybe he's an Assyrian, uh, Iraqi, uh, Christian, and they voted for him, thinking he might have been Ken, and it turns out he was quite the opposite.
[01:42:38.276 --> 01:42:43.241]  Uh, he served in the Israel Defense Force during the first Gulf War, for example, when
[01:42:43.781 --> 01:42:53.607]  You know, our American men and women were going to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia and that part of the world to fight against Saddam Hussein.
[01:42:53.687 --> 01:42:57.769]  Rahm Emanuel thought it was more important to go join the IDF.
[01:42:59.795 --> 01:43:12.283]  I mean, I can't get over the irony, Wayne Madsen, of Rahm Emanuel being part of an administration, and indeed Emanuel himself pushing to become mayor of Chicago.
[01:43:12.984 --> 01:43:24.211]  An administration that tells Americans to inform on each other to stop terrorism, when Obama's right-hand man is the son of a terrorist who likes to blow up buses and hotels.
[01:43:24.271 --> 01:43:26.653]  I really can't get over the richness of that.
[01:43:27.513 --> 01:43:29.274]  Well, I mean, you're right.
[01:43:29.314 --> 01:43:32.976]  Look, I just don't want to pin this.
[01:43:33.016 --> 01:43:34.097]  There are so many hypocrites.
[01:43:34.137 --> 01:43:49.245]  Look, the new chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, Peter King from Long Island, was a supporter not just of the Irish Republican Army, but the provisional wing of the Irish Republican Army, the most violent wing of the Irish Republican Army.
[01:43:49.585 --> 01:43:55.749]  And he's now saying we ought to round up Muslims because they're potential terrorists, when this guy King himself
[01:43:56.749 --> 01:44:08.923]  See, you know, if it's Irish terrorism or Israeli terrorism, it seems to be okay with people in this government and in the Congress and in the White House.
[01:44:09.784 --> 01:44:16.071]  But if it's any other kind of terrorism, of course, we're supposed to become the shtazi and inform on everybody.
[01:44:17.091 --> 01:44:20.193]  Oh yeah, as long as the terrorists are working for them, that's just fine.
[01:44:20.633 --> 01:44:33.240]  But, I mean, for those who are, you know, loathe to blame Rom for the sins of the father, consider what he did after Bill Clinton's re-election in 1996, which is another famous story.
[01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:42.845]  You know, especially in light of all this recent contrived media rhetoric about telling people to tone down the vitriol after the Giffords shooting.
[01:44:43.265 --> 01:44:44.786]  Tell the listeners what
[01:44:45.166 --> 01:44:50.511]  Rahm Emanuel did during this Clinton re-election celebration in 96.
[01:44:51.732 --> 01:44:53.813]  Well, I mean, there was a couple of weird things.
[01:44:53.833 --> 01:44:57.837]  You know, he sent a dead fish to a political opponent.
[01:44:57.977 --> 01:45:00.599]  I mean, that's right out of the Godfather, isn't it?
[01:45:00.639 --> 01:45:05.283]  I mean, he did everything but, you know, put a horse's head on somebody's front porch.
[01:45:05.984 --> 01:45:08.426]  He also stabbed a steak knife into a
[01:45:08.866 --> 01:45:09.806]  I'm not exaggerating.
[01:45:09.826 --> 01:45:14.128]  Now he got his start getting involved in political campaigns in the 80s, mostly presidential campaigns.
[01:45:28.892 --> 01:45:31.973]  There was Senator Paul Simon's campaign for president.
[01:45:32.353 --> 01:45:33.313]  He was from Illinois.
[01:45:33.333 --> 01:45:36.674]  And there was John Glenn's presidential campaign.
[01:45:37.434 --> 01:45:39.094]  So that's how he got in.
[01:45:39.554 --> 01:45:40.714]  He's not an attorney.
[01:45:40.754 --> 01:45:44.115]  His degree is in public communications.
[01:45:44.135 --> 01:45:45.275]  That's his background.
[01:45:46.095 --> 01:45:53.057]  But of course, you know, in Chicago, he was going to go, originally, to ballet school.
[01:45:53.117 --> 01:45:54.657]  You know, he was a ballet dancer.
[01:45:56.438 --> 01:45:59.840]  But he wound up going to Sarah Lawrence College instead.
[01:46:01.521 --> 01:46:06.844]  It's a strange leap from being a ballet dancer to a member of the Israeli Defense Force.
[01:46:07.285 --> 01:46:10.426]  But going back to that, yeah, that's what I was reading about before.
[01:46:10.447 --> 01:46:20.933]  He was jamming the knife in the dinner table and screaming out the name of Clinton's political adversaries, and after each name screaming, dead, dead, dead.
[01:46:21.313 --> 01:46:24.015]  I mean, talk about violent rhetoric.
[01:46:24.535 --> 01:46:31.038]  This is the administration that's lecturing us all about violent rhetoric, and one of the top guys in there comes out with this.
[01:46:33.099 --> 01:46:40.403]  Also, there was the incident, and I mean, this is just an insight into how Rahm Emanuel is such a thoroughly pleasant chap.
[01:46:41.683 --> 01:46:47.046]  Tell the listeners about the shower incident, which of course was featured on this David Letterman clip.
[01:46:47.802 --> 01:46:52.266]  Right, this was during the whole health care bill debate.
[01:46:53.307 --> 01:47:16.506]  Representative Eric Mass, a Democrat from New York, was using the House of Representatives gymnasium shower, where he was confronted by a naked Rahm Emanuel in the shower, who was poking him in the chest with his finger, reading in the Riot Act about his lack of support for the Obama health care bill.
[01:47:17.046 --> 01:47:28.331]  Of course, Massa said, you know, I mean, Rahm Emanuel's the kind of person who would strap his own mother onto the front of a steam locomotive if he thought it could get him some political points.
[01:47:28.351 --> 01:47:34.093]  Of course, Massa wound up resigning amidst this scandal.
[01:47:34.153 --> 01:47:41.196]  And, you know, it just seems to me that from talking to people very much involved in that whole episode,
[01:47:41.777 --> 01:47:49.799]  That massive was targeted by some political tricks operation operating out of the Obama White House.
[01:47:51.226 --> 01:47:56.230]  I mean, I thought we saw enough of that with Karl Rove during the Bush administration.
[01:47:56.610 --> 01:48:08.581]  But apparently it was a nice transition where we went from Karl Rove as George Bush's chief hitman to Obama, who had Rahm Emanuel as his chief hitman.
[01:48:08.621 --> 01:48:15.327]  And now it looks like we got Bill Daley, who's part of this whole Chicago mafia, coming in as the new Obama chief hitman.
[01:48:15.347 --> 01:48:17.689]  Of course, he's probably more concerned about placating
[01:48:18.269 --> 01:48:19.029]  We're good to go.
[01:48:41.787 --> 01:48:51.075]  In a, he's not even in, although he's been convicted of federal crimes, he's not even in a federal penitentiary.
[01:48:51.716 --> 01:48:59.843]  He's in, he's in solitary and I mean, it's like this guy's one of the rendition people from, you know, it's down in Guantanamo.
[01:49:02.193 --> 01:49:02.634]  Exactly.
[01:49:02.654 --> 01:49:13.726]  And I mean, by the sounds of it, this is the kind of personality in Rahm Emanuel who would work his way up the political ladder with, you know, brute force and intimidation.
[01:49:14.287 --> 01:49:16.349]  From your research, is that the case?
[01:49:16.410 --> 01:49:21.595]  Is this how he rose to prominence, or was it merely, you know, political deals with his allies?
[01:49:22.699 --> 01:49:24.861]  Yeah, it's a little bit of both.
[01:49:24.981 --> 01:49:29.005]  He made deals, obviously, after he left the Clinton White House.
[01:49:29.045 --> 01:49:34.970]  And you know, Hillary Clinton wanted to fire him in 1993, but it never happened.
[01:49:35.511 --> 01:49:41.116]  President Clinton arranged for him to go work for McClarty, chief of staff.
[01:49:41.136 --> 01:49:45.860]  But for some reason, Hillary and Rahm Emanuel never got along.
[01:49:46.721 --> 01:49:52.892]  And during that 2008 campaign, remember, the Rahm Emanuel for an awful long time was neutral.
[01:49:53.252 --> 01:49:58.722]  He only came out and supported Obama when Obama started winning in some of those caucus states.
[01:49:59.712 --> 01:50:03.913]  And some of the smaller primaries have started to build up some momentum.
[01:50:04.033 --> 01:50:07.594]  Then he came out and supported Obama.
[01:50:07.874 --> 01:50:23.297]  But this whole thing with Rahm Emanuel, he leaves, takes a job with the Wall Street firm Wasserstein and Perella, and then he makes $16 million there, which of course feeds into his congressional campaign.
[01:50:24.097 --> 01:50:41.956]  2002.
[01:50:24.418 --> 01:50:41.956]  And the other thing, President Clinton appointed Rahm Emanuel to the board of Freddie Mac, and we know how corrupt, all the corruption there with Freddie Mac, so it's possible that Emanuel and the Clintons probably have, are in a mutually assured destruction situation.
[01:50:43.271 --> 01:50:44.312]  Okay, we'll be back.
[01:50:44.453 --> 01:50:46.896]  Final segment with Wayne Madsen after the break.
[01:50:47.356 --> 01:50:51.802]  Third hour, Joel Skousen sits in for his hosting debut on the Alex Jones Show.

[01:51:01.286 --> 01:51:03.148]  Not all protein supplements are created equal.
[01:51:03.548 --> 01:51:12.136]  One World Whey is the first cold-temperature-processed, 100% all-natural, unrefined, bioactive, grass-pasture-raised, milk-whey protein.
[01:51:12.537 --> 01:51:25.249]  Far from being another ordinary protein supplement, One World Whey is a full-spectrum nutrition power food in and of itself, providing overall life-building benefits that touch virtually every human's life, that other protein supplements don't deliver on.
[01:51:25.689 --> 01:51:26.509]  What are the benefits?
[01:51:26.890 --> 01:51:39.375]  Boosts the immune system, anti-aging properties, helps detoxification, helps reduce body fat, excellent for building lean muscle, increases energy levels, enhances the feelings of youth, sports performance, exercise recovery.
[01:51:39.895 --> 01:51:40.435]  Who's it for?
[01:51:40.835 --> 01:51:49.879]  Busy people, hard-working executives, students, teachers, active seniors, people recovering from illness, office workers, construction workers, and high-performance athletes.

[01:52:00.386 --> 01:52:01.647]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:01.687 --> 01:52:07.031]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:07.271 --> 01:52:11.895]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:12.295 --> 01:52:17.319]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:52:17.839 --> 01:52:22.544]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:23.064 --> 01:52:25.006]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:52:25.386 --> 01:52:29.991]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:52:30.191 --> 01:52:31.092]  And here's the best part.
[01:52:31.312 --> 01:52:34.074]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:52:34.395 --> 01:52:37.678]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:52:37.978 --> 01:52:40.820]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:41.180 --> 01:52:43.061]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[01:52:44.662 --> 01:52:47.463]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:47.984 --> 01:52:49.745]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:59.970 --> 01:53:09.298]  Nine years, thousands of clients worldwide, amazing results, and here's more proof of the effectiveness of how heart and body extract supports good circulation and healthy arterial flow.
[01:53:09.478 --> 01:53:10.439]  My name is Crystal.
[01:53:10.800 --> 01:53:13.402]  I'm a 45-year-old and live in Houston, Texas.
[01:53:13.742 --> 01:53:17.345]  I was diagnosed with having mitral valve prolapse 10 years ago.
[01:53:17.706 --> 01:53:21.669]  My cardiologist said surgery and drugs was the only thing he could offer me.
[01:53:21.829 --> 01:53:22.650]  What did Crystal do?
[01:53:22.670 --> 01:53:26.154]  I ordered Heart and Body Extract in August 2006.
[01:53:26.615 --> 01:53:32.922]  When I first took my first 15 drops, I embraced the formula and could even feel the goodness of the formula starting to work.
[01:53:33.022 --> 01:53:36.586]  Clean, clear arteries are happy arteries after using Heart and Body Extract.

[01:54:28.880 --> 01:54:29.660]  Welcome back.
[01:54:30.120 --> 01:54:32.561]  Here are the Google search terms once again for today.
[01:54:32.581 --> 01:54:34.641]  Google search term number one.
[01:54:34.881 --> 01:54:36.602]  You are the resistance.
[01:54:36.802 --> 01:54:38.162]  You are the resistance.
[01:54:38.482 --> 01:54:39.923]  Search term number two.
[01:54:40.283 --> 01:54:42.263]  Occupation of America.
[01:54:42.424 --> 01:54:44.504]  That's occupation of America.
[01:54:44.964 --> 01:54:46.945]  And search term number three.
[01:54:47.345 --> 01:54:48.605]  V for victory.

[01:54:52.926 --> 01:54:54.567]  Get us to the top of Google Trends.
[01:54:54.947 --> 01:55:01.654]  And more people will discover what we're trying to achieve with this Resistance V for Victory campaign.
[01:55:01.914 --> 01:55:11.683]  We're talking with Wayne Madsen, WayneMadsenReport.com, and we're talking about Rahm Emanuel and I just wanted to touch upon in the final segment
[01:55:12.444 --> 01:55:27.052]  What you thought of this scary interview that Emmanuel gave in 2006 with Ben Smith of the New York Post where he says, quote, we're going to have universal civil defense training somewhere between the ages of 18 to 25.
[01:55:27.552 --> 01:55:36.097]  You will do three months of training but there can be nothing wrong with all Americans having a joint similar experience of what we call civil defense training.
[01:55:36.377 --> 01:55:41.300]  And then in a later C-SPAN interview, Emmanuel said that the
[01:55:41.980 --> 01:55:45.763]  Civil defense training would be, quote, required of everybody.
[01:55:46.584 --> 01:55:58.954]  So they were basically floating a plan for a mandatory civil defense draft, which at the time fused with these fears about Obama's, quote, civilian national security source.
[01:56:01.596 --> 01:56:05.259]  I mean, what's Rom's role in pushing this whole civil draft thing?
[01:56:05.319 --> 01:56:08.281]  Is it merely a throwback to his IDF days?
[01:56:08.961 --> 01:56:13.445]  And can you see something like this coming to pass in America with the right crisis?
[01:56:14.568 --> 01:56:23.910]  Well, certainly I think it's partly influenced by the fact that everyone has to serve through a draft in Israel.
[01:56:23.970 --> 01:56:38.174]  But the whole concept in a country like the United States seems to harken back to the brown shirts of Nazi Germany more than the Israeli draft, military draft.
[01:56:38.254 --> 01:56:42.715]  And I think, you know, the rhetoric like that coupled with
[01:56:43.730 --> 01:56:55.767]  Uh, you know, internet kill switches and all the other crazy stuff we hear coming out of this White House, uh, from Cass Sunstein and his cognitive infiltration program of websites and groups.
[01:56:56.551 --> 01:57:07.582]  I think this goes to show that the Obama administration, in some respects, is actually worse than the previous administration, which may have wanted to push.
[01:57:08.002 --> 01:57:16.751]  Bush may have wanted to carry some of this out, but I guess they knew how far they could go, where this administration figures there is no
[01:57:17.358 --> 01:57:18.599]  Goalpost here.
[01:57:18.979 --> 01:57:20.180]  There is no end zone.
[01:57:20.220 --> 01:57:30.328]  They can keep moving the goalpost till they get what they desire and I think it's something less than what we would recognize as a democracy.
[01:57:32.169 --> 01:57:40.396]  And just finally for the last couple of minutes tell people about waynemadsonreport.com and how they can subscribe to your material there.
[01:57:41.187 --> 01:57:51.012]  Well, it's waynematsonreport.com, it's all one word, and they can subscribe through PayPal or by snail mail.
[01:57:51.792 --> 01:57:58.216]  And basically, I'm trying to do what Jack Anderson and Drew Pearson did in Washington for many, many years.
[01:57:58.896 --> 01:58:02.718]  Do the muckraking, get the stories out, the stuff that never gets passed.
[01:58:03.266 --> 01:58:08.799]  The editors, the publishers of the corporate media in this town because the media in Washington, D.C.
[01:58:09.340 --> 01:58:10.964]  is absolutely controlled.
[01:58:13.286 --> 01:58:15.888]  Okay, Wayne Manson, a pleasure speaking with you.
[01:58:15.908 --> 01:58:16.608]  Thanks for your time.
[01:58:16.628 --> 01:58:21.371]  We'll be sure to be talking to you again very soon on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:58:22.272 --> 01:58:22.672]  Thanks.
[01:58:23.473 --> 01:58:29.697]  And it's Joel Skousen coming up in the third hour, in the final hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:58:29.737 --> 01:58:35.701]  Remember, get your V for Victory resistance posters at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
