[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.983]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:00:21.983 --> 00:00:35.869]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:37.910]  They've admitted we don't have the adults.
[00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.291]  Al Gore says this, we're going right for your children.
[00:00:43.892 --> 00:00:44.753]  Ah, Earth.
[00:00:44.753 --> 00:00:46.915]  Healthy, strong, and full of life.
[00:00:46.915 --> 00:00:47.835]  But wait!
[00:00:47.835 --> 00:00:50.097]  What's that you've got there?
[00:00:50.097 --> 00:00:53.280]  It looks like you've got a case on the humans!
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:01.066]  To be a healthy Earth, all of your elements must be in equilibrium.
[00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:07.130]  However, these parasites slaughter all other forms of life.
[00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.652]  Guzzle your natural resources.
[00:01:12.197 --> 00:01:18.720]  And poison your atmosphere.
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.322]  Once contracted, humans act quickly.
[00:01:21.322 --> 00:01:30.206]  They multiply over 300,000 a day, consuming anything that crosses their path.
[00:01:30.206 --> 00:01:33.728]  Earth is just the start.
[00:01:33.728 --> 00:01:35.429]  Who knows what's next?
[00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:40.456]  We're good to go.
[00:01:44.212 --> 00:01:50.057]  Yes, I just played for you the 2007 Berlin Film Festival winner of short films.
[00:01:50.057 --> 00:02:04.508]  It's called Humans by Three Legs, and it shows humans not just a scourge on the planet Earth, the people that brought you Beethoven, the folks that brought you mathematics, the mind of Max Planck envisioning atomic theory.
[00:02:04.508 --> 00:02:06.869]  I mean, that's humans.
[00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:13.955]  We are a scourge, and it shows us, unfortunately, spreading to space and destroying the universe at the end.
[00:02:15.396 --> 00:02:40.214]  I mean this is incredible and I was just thinking this morning about how many video clips I mean I have ABC News Australia the headline teaching kids when to die and it says if you don't kill yourself by 11 or 14 in the calculations even if you try to have a good carbon footprint you must die at 14 little animals died it shows little puppies having their heads chopped up in fact guys pull up the ABC story
[00:02:41.134 --> 00:02:50.320]  ABC tells kids when to die, and then we have the Prison Planet article that actually has screenshots, because they pulled it, of the heads being cut off of small animals.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.541]  So the message is, small animals are dying.
[00:02:52.541 --> 00:02:57.104]  And I talk to parents who still have their children in private school and government brainwashing camps.
[00:02:57.104 --> 00:02:58.605]  That's why I homeschool my children.
[00:02:59.945 --> 00:03:07.348]  And their young daughters and sons will start crying when they see a construction site or bulldozers, and they say, I need to die.
[00:03:07.348 --> 00:03:12.670]  I mean, I've had people at pool parties, you know, tell me this.
[00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:13.570]  Their children cry.
[00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:14.750]  It's seven-year-olds.
[00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.031]  It's time for me to die.
[00:03:16.031 --> 00:03:16.471]  I'm evil.
[00:03:17.091 --> 00:03:29.895]  And then we have, of course, this 1010 project funded through the Climate Exchange and Al Gore, The Guardian, local governments in England funding it, saying it's your choice, and the kids say, I don't want to make carbon cuts, and so they murder them.
[00:03:29.895 --> 00:03:36.238]  They blow them up with guts and blood, and then those that submit to the tyranny, they have blood all over them and are horrified.
[00:03:36.238 --> 00:03:45.601]  Then they kill footballers, and blow up coaches, and blow up talk show hosts, and they have a corporate scene with a corporate boss standing above all his employees with an arrogant effeminate
[00:03:46.301 --> 00:03:49.403]  Uh, you know, behavior these people always have for some reason.
[00:03:49.403 --> 00:03:51.645]  And, and says, oh lovely, you're not going to do it?
[00:03:51.645 --> 00:03:53.186]  Good, I get to kill you.
[00:03:53.186 --> 00:03:55.027]  And kills them.
[00:03:55.027 --> 00:03:56.809]  So, then I have this article.
[00:03:57.873 --> 00:04:08.759]  An alternative to the new wave of eco-fascism, the Guardian says, why these calls for total tyranny and Nazism are bad, we just need a soft, loving tyranny.
[00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:13.382]  So there's a total shift to them saying, look, you won't go along with this, we're going to kill you.
[00:04:13.382 --> 00:04:19.825]  Dillingpole, an expert on this, joins us, and we're going to later play a short clip of Pachari saying, hey, we're going to scare the kids.
[00:04:19.825 --> 00:04:24.348]  And they've admitted, we don't have the adults, Al Gore says this, we're going right for your children.
[00:04:24.568 --> 00:04:31.471]  So are you going to let them indoctrinate your children with an anti-human hate of themselves and how to commit suicide?
[00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:33.991]  These people are totally criminal.
[00:04:33.991 --> 00:04:40.454]  I mean, they're trying to arrest members of Parliament in Europe who criticize Muslims mildly for hate crime.
[00:04:40.454 --> 00:04:41.894]  Is this not a hate crime?
[00:04:41.894 --> 00:04:43.435]  Teaching kids to commit suicide?
[00:04:46.468 --> 00:04:48.974]  And that was 11 years ago.
[00:04:48.974 --> 00:04:51.400]  2007 Anti-Human Agenda Exposed.
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.084]  Now at Banned.Video.
[00:04:53.084 --> 00:04:54.427]  Share it while you still can.
[00:04:54.427 --> 00:04:54.908]  Stay with us.
[00:04:54.908 --> 00:04:55.549]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:55.549 --> 00:04:56.451]  Stephen Crowder coming up.
[00:04:59.403 --> 00:05:21.638]  The technocrats, the social engineers, the behavioral psychologists, they're all part of the same satanic, globalist, control freak system that seeks to play God, that seeks to turn the general population of this Earth into their slaves, into putty, into clay in their hands that they control.
[00:05:21.638 --> 00:05:28.843]  And chief amongst their physical attacks is keeping us from high quality vitamins and minerals that are essential for life on this planet.
[00:05:29.583 --> 00:05:35.887]  And so, the information we cover exposes their evil works and sabotages their globalist takeover.
[00:05:35.887 --> 00:05:39.630]  And we're having an incredible effect thanks to your support and your word of mouth.
[00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:46.114]  But it's also important to take care of our bodies themselves with high-quality water filtration at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:05:46.114 --> 00:05:55.961]  And with amazing supplements, many of which that just came back in stock, like Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, now 40% off for a limited time at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:05:55.961 --> 00:05:58.363]  So let's fight the info war, but also take care of our bodies.
[00:06:14.725 --> 00:06:15.826]  InfoWars.
[00:06:15.826 --> 00:06:21.932]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:06:21.932 --> 00:06:27.157]  Two years ago it was revealed the Communist Chinese agents stole
[00:06:28.277 --> 00:06:37.480]  Super deadly viruses out of a Canadian lab and transferred them to Bill Gates's operative Fauci and Daszak.
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:41.762]  That's now all confirmed, hitting mainstream news around the world.
[00:06:42.875 --> 00:06:48.018]  When they transferred the virus, it had a 40% kill rate in humans that were infected.
[00:06:48.018 --> 00:06:51.360]  Now they've souped it up to be airborne and kill 80%.
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:57.643]  And Bill Gates is telling you, and running drills right now, that a more deadly virus is coming.
[00:06:57.643 --> 00:06:59.184]  And now we learn.
[00:06:59.184 --> 00:07:05.027]  The virus, for the first time, has appeared in the wild in India.
[00:07:05.027 --> 00:07:06.308]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:07:07.386 --> 00:07:11.732]  Ladies and gentlemen, this isn't the 1990s film, 12 Monkeys.
[00:07:11.732 --> 00:07:13.214]  This isn't fiction.
[00:07:13.214 --> 00:07:15.376]  This is happening right now.
[00:07:15.376 --> 00:07:21.845]  But as the plot of the film showed, it's about a global elite wanting depopulation and pulling the trigger.
[00:07:39.697 --> 00:07:41.319]  Excuse me, sir.
[00:07:41.319 --> 00:07:48.445]  Would you mind letting me have a look at the contents of your bag, please?
[00:07:48.445 --> 00:07:53.769]  Me?
[00:07:53.769 --> 00:07:56.531]  Biological samples.
[00:07:56.531 --> 00:07:58.853]  I have the papers right here.
[00:07:58.853 --> 00:08:03.457]  Well, I'm gonna have to ask you to open this up, sir.
[00:08:03.457 --> 00:08:03.718]  Open it?
[00:08:06.028 --> 00:08:07.829]  Yes, of course.
[00:08:07.829 --> 00:08:08.989]  Stupid man!
[00:08:08.989 --> 00:08:11.550]  You have to get in the line!
[00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:11.870]  See?
[00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:13.571]  Biological.
[00:08:13.571 --> 00:08:15.551]  Check the papers.
[00:08:15.551 --> 00:08:17.432]  It's all proper.
[00:08:17.432 --> 00:08:23.254]  Get the permit.
[00:08:23.254 --> 00:08:25.335]  It's empty.
[00:08:25.335 --> 00:08:27.275]  Well, yes, to be sure.
[00:08:27.275 --> 00:08:29.856]  It looks empty.
[00:08:29.856 --> 00:08:31.597]  I assure you, it's not.
[00:08:33.135 --> 00:08:34.375]  No, ma'am, I don't have to understand.
[00:08:34.375 --> 00:08:36.196]  You said that, but you have to get in line.
[00:08:36.196 --> 00:08:38.237]  No, I understand that you cannot get in line.
[00:08:38.237 --> 00:08:38.977]  You have to get in line.
[00:08:38.977 --> 00:08:40.598]  There you see?
[00:08:40.598 --> 00:08:45.739]  Also invisible to the naked eye.
[00:08:45.739 --> 00:08:50.741]  It doesn't even have an odor.
[00:08:50.741 --> 00:08:52.862]  That's not necessary, sir.
[00:08:52.862 --> 00:08:53.862]  There you go.
[00:08:53.862 --> 00:08:55.523]  Thank you for your cooperation.
[00:08:55.523 --> 00:08:56.123]  Have a good flight.
[00:09:13.183 --> 00:09:18.325]  We're supposed to use the VAERS to look for unusual things, and we're seeing unusual deaths.
[00:09:18.325 --> 00:09:27.250]  We're seeing secondary deaths from people just, you know, giving off something, whether it's the vaccine or some component of it, that's killing other people around them.
[00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:29.831]  Who weren't, who didn't receive the injection?
[00:09:30.813 --> 00:09:45.542]  The most compelling one is a one-month-old baby that was breastfeeding, mother gets the second Pfizer shot, baby dies of rare thrombocytopenia, which is one of the things I've written a paper about that's going to be published on the thrombocytopenia following this drug.
[00:09:45.542 --> 00:09:49.045]  Thrombocytopenia, folks, is when you don't make any platelet cells.
[00:09:49.045 --> 00:09:54.328]  And when you don't make any platelet cells, your blood doesn't clot and you can bleed to death.
[00:09:55.023 --> 00:09:55.283]  Right.
[00:09:55.283 --> 00:09:58.484]  So it's an unusual, this is not anything we've seen before.
[00:09:58.484 --> 00:10:01.784]  It's not the thrombocytopenia that you and I have seen as physicians in the past.
[00:10:01.784 --> 00:10:04.365]  Totally different animal and this is happening.
[00:10:04.365 --> 00:10:07.286]  That's the kind of thing that should stop any other vaccine program.
[00:10:07.286 --> 00:10:08.806]  But this is not a vaccine program.
[00:10:08.806 --> 00:10:10.266]  This is something else.
[00:10:10.266 --> 00:10:13.887]  And it's interesting that they're now telling pregnant women they can get it, children they can get it.
[00:10:13.887 --> 00:10:23.569]  But I'm going to read from one of the studies that says, reproductive toxicity, animal studies of potential toxicity to reproduction and development have not yet been completed.
[00:10:24.375 --> 00:10:31.799]  Um, neither genotoxicity, meaning how it damages your genome, your DNA or RNA, or carcinogenicity studies were performed.
[00:10:31.799 --> 00:10:35.881]  However, the components of the vaccine are not expected to have genotoxic potential.
[00:10:35.881 --> 00:10:40.204]  I'm comforted by that.
[00:10:40.204 --> 00:10:42.945]  That's Dr. Lee Merritt.
[00:10:42.945 --> 00:10:51.830]  I have some family, pretty close family, that doesn't listen to me, that took the Pfizer shot and now has the platelet disease.
[00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:52.371]  Out of nowhere,
[00:10:53.422 --> 00:10:57.583]  Three months after the shots, and it's now being put on hospice preparing to die.
[00:10:57.583 --> 00:11:00.604]  They have no platelets.
[00:11:00.604 --> 00:11:05.205]  I just learned that in the last few days.
[00:11:05.205 --> 00:11:07.546]  It is the soft kill weapon.
[00:11:07.546 --> 00:11:13.727]  It's being unrolled against us now, but it's not just scientists and doctors like Merritt that are out telling the truth.
[00:11:13.727 --> 00:11:20.889]  I saw this clip this morning of this amazing lady, everything she says is true, on Instagram, simply stating the facts of this criminal gaslighting.
[00:11:23.336 --> 00:11:34.824]  I had a gentleman argue with me today saying that the unvaxxed are dying at a rapid rate compared to the vaccinated.
[00:11:34.824 --> 00:11:36.185]  He wanted me to show him proof.
[00:11:37.017 --> 00:11:39.639]  And not to tell him to look up his own research.
[00:11:39.639 --> 00:11:52.727]  So I provided him with CDC stats and the FDA where they recalled the PCR test because they were 200% wrong on their positive cases.
[00:11:52.727 --> 00:11:54.488]  That was overlooked, completely ignored.
[00:11:56.252 --> 00:12:03.855]  I sent him article after article about how West Virginia governors said that 97% of people in the hospitals are double-taxed.
[00:12:03.855 --> 00:12:07.356]  That doesn't count.
[00:12:07.356 --> 00:12:13.738]  Imagine, still, two years later, thinking that this is about a virus.
[00:12:13.738 --> 00:12:19.100]  Imagine, still, thinking that this is not a power grab by the government.
[00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:23.822]  Imagine, still, thinking that masks save lives.
[00:12:25.993 --> 00:12:31.015]  Imagine still thinking that if you're unvaccinated, you're going to die.
[00:12:31.015 --> 00:12:31.675]  Even though there's a 99.7.
[00:12:31.675 --> 00:12:34.936]  I have had COVID.
[00:12:34.936 --> 00:12:35.696]  Do you know what I did?
[00:12:35.696 --> 00:12:40.018]  I took Advil.
[00:12:40.018 --> 00:12:40.518]  And that was fine.
[00:12:41.377 --> 00:12:42.538]  I've had worse quotes.
[00:12:42.538 --> 00:12:47.361]  Why do these people think that getting COVID is an automatic death sentence?
[00:12:47.361 --> 00:12:50.103]  Also, why are people only dying in the hospitals?
[00:12:50.103 --> 00:12:52.084]  Why, why, why?
[00:12:52.084 --> 00:12:53.985]  Why aren't more people asking?
[00:12:53.985 --> 00:12:56.087]  Why?
[00:12:56.087 --> 00:12:57.908]  Is discernment dead?
[00:12:57.908 --> 00:13:00.930]  Is common sense dead?
[00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:09.356]  Do these people literally just watch their TV screens and go, okay, all right, yeah, that doesn't make sense, but I'm gonna live it.
[00:13:11.161 --> 00:13:12.401]  I want off.
[00:13:12.401 --> 00:13:28.585]  I want off this fucking ride and I want this movie to end because I have lost respect for half of society.
[00:13:28.585 --> 00:13:30.586]  Well, I'm ready to vote for her for president right now.
[00:13:30.586 --> 00:13:33.206]  I don't even know her name.
[00:13:33.206 --> 00:13:34.727]  She wants off this effing ride.
[00:13:35.657 --> 00:13:44.544]  If you want to know what living inside the New World Order is going to be like, well, look in the mirror, because you're inside just the beginning of it, and as you notice, it gets worse by the minute.
[00:13:44.544 --> 00:13:48.767]  Thanks for joining us on this live, original October 19th transmission.
[00:13:50.799 --> 00:13:54.940]  And I see a lot of listeners email us and they call us and they say, man, all you talk about is the vaccine.
[00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:56.861]  All you talk about is the Great Reset.
[00:13:56.861 --> 00:13:58.321]  All you talk about is the new order.
[00:13:58.321 --> 00:13:59.922]  Because it's everything.
[00:13:59.922 --> 00:14:03.683]  It's going to destroy our way of life and finally kill us.
[00:14:03.683 --> 00:14:05.824]  This is modern war.
[00:14:05.824 --> 00:14:08.665]  I know they're teaching five-year-olds how to give blowjobs.
[00:14:09.145 --> 00:14:10.185]  We already know that.
[00:14:10.185 --> 00:14:11.886]  I know there's Satan worshippers everywhere.
[00:14:11.886 --> 00:14:13.166]  Hell, I got Reuters right here.
[00:14:13.166 --> 00:14:17.988]  200,000 children raped in France by clergy alone, government admits.
[00:14:17.988 --> 00:14:20.168]  Total pedophile rings run the government.
[00:14:20.168 --> 00:14:21.809]  You can take one look at Macron.
[00:14:21.809 --> 00:14:25.950]  He was one they used at age 12 as a sex operative.
[00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:26.710]  I know all that.
[00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:29.131]  I know the Federal Reserve's private.
[00:14:29.131 --> 00:14:31.431]  I've been on air 28 years saying it.
[00:14:31.431 --> 00:14:34.172]  The New World Order is now attacking us.
[00:14:34.172 --> 00:14:36.673]  It's the Tyrannosaurus Rex eating us.
[00:14:38.649 --> 00:14:49.159]  I can talk about the pack of gremlins that run around behind it all day long, but this is the big world government, world ID, carbon tax controlling everything you do.
[00:14:49.159 --> 00:14:51.502]  And it's just Reuters, just a minor headline.
[00:14:51.502 --> 00:14:54.765]  Yeah, 200,000 kids raped, sold to sex slavery, some killed, no big deal.
[00:14:54.765 --> 00:14:57.367]  But none of it exists, CNN says, and Twitter.
[00:14:57.367 --> 00:15:00.030]  Oh, you know, Alex Jones is crazy, there's no pedophile rings.
[00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:00.931]  Oh, no, no, no, no.
[00:15:02.574 --> 00:15:05.276]  And the UN and NATO just run giant operations.
[00:15:05.276 --> 00:15:11.781]  Yes, pure evil got control, it multiplied, it took over, and now we're being attacked.
[00:15:11.781 --> 00:15:14.883]  So, same thing in Germany.
[00:15:14.883 --> 00:15:17.105]  All run by the CIA.
[00:15:17.105 --> 00:15:19.907]  All run by the globalists to bring down the society.
[00:15:19.907 --> 00:15:22.769]  Because if they can't kill babies before they're born, they're sure as hell going to rape them.
[00:15:24.744 --> 00:15:26.245]  So, here's the deal.
[00:15:26.245 --> 00:15:28.065]  This is what happens every day.
[00:15:28.065 --> 00:15:31.566]  I study at night, I get up at 5 in the morning, sometimes 4.30 in the morning.
[00:15:31.566 --> 00:15:32.787]  I'm super well-researched.
[00:15:32.787 --> 00:15:35.207]  I get in here and have like hundreds of articles, hundreds of clips.
[00:15:35.207 --> 00:15:36.248]  They're all totally insane.
[00:15:36.248 --> 00:15:37.588]  You just saw a bunch of them.
[00:15:37.588 --> 00:15:39.609]  That's not 1% of what I got today.
[00:15:39.609 --> 00:15:41.530]  And I got Steven Crowder coming up in 15 minutes.
[00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:41.970]  And I got...
[00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:43.531]  I got something.
[00:15:43.531 --> 00:15:44.351]  You want to hear about the virus?
[00:15:44.351 --> 00:15:45.772]  Well, most of you do, I know.
[00:15:45.772 --> 00:15:46.753]  You understand it's a takeover.
[00:15:46.753 --> 00:15:48.294]  You get what this is about.
[00:15:48.294 --> 00:15:50.916]  This is the fight now for the whole world government.
[00:15:50.916 --> 00:15:53.798]  But there's bigger news that just broke on the virus front.
[00:15:53.798 --> 00:15:57.701]  Fauci cooked up something that kills 80% of people, and evidence shows they may have already released it.
[00:15:57.701 --> 00:16:06.107]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[00:16:06.107 --> 00:16:07.127]  Here's why.
[00:16:07.127 --> 00:16:10.430]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:16.152]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[00:16:16.152 --> 00:16:25.156]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes, and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[00:16:25.156 --> 00:16:33.119]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[00:16:33.832 --> 00:16:39.933]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses too!
[00:16:39.933 --> 00:16:43.754]  Go to MySolarBackup.com to learn more and check availability.
[00:16:43.754 --> 00:16:45.775]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[00:16:45.775 --> 00:16:54.176]  Look for the free report, Crisis Cooling, how to make absolutely sure your meat, milk, and medicines stay safe and cool in any power outage.
[00:16:54.176 --> 00:16:56.537]  Yours free at MySolarBackup.com.
[00:16:57.113 --> 00:16:58.074]  Hey everybody!
[00:16:58.074 --> 00:17:03.559]  If you've ever thought about heirloom beans as a storable survival food, I've got great news.
[00:17:03.559 --> 00:17:06.021]  In fact, I'll bet it's the best news you've heard in a while.
[00:17:06.021 --> 00:17:06.862]  Here's the thing.
[00:17:06.862 --> 00:17:11.166]  We've just received a fresh batch of gourmet heirloom beans.
[00:17:11.166 --> 00:17:12.527]  Survival soup beans.
[00:17:12.527 --> 00:17:20.714]  These beans are gorgeous, highly nutritious, and above all, with no hesitation whatsoever, the best tasting beans in the entire world.
[00:17:20.714 --> 00:17:21.255]  The best part?
[00:17:21.795 --> 00:17:31.078]  We've dropped the price by 33% this week for listeners who know higher food prices are coming and want an inflation hedge you can actually eat if you want to.
[00:17:31.078 --> 00:17:32.118]  Gets even better!
[00:17:32.118 --> 00:17:42.861]  With your permission, and with a high regard for your health and well-being, I also want to send you two pounds of what we think is the single most underrated superfood in the world.
[00:17:42.861 --> 00:17:43.281]  Period.
[00:17:43.681 --> 00:17:45.722]  Go to soupbeansurvival.com.
[00:17:45.722 --> 00:17:47.863]  That's soupbeansurvival.com.
[00:17:47.863 --> 00:17:51.965]  And discover the real reason we're giving this unusual superfood away.
[00:17:51.965 --> 00:17:53.846]  At soupbeansurvival.com.
[00:17:53.846 --> 00:18:00.969]  That's soupbeansurvival.com.
[00:18:00.969 --> 00:18:05.931]  If you only knew the power of the dark side.
[00:18:05.931 --> 00:18:11.594]  Join Bill Gates and together we will defeat humanity.
[00:18:12.864 --> 00:18:18.874]  Then our God Satan will reward us with eternal life.
[00:18:18.874 --> 00:18:21.758]  That's basically the ethos of the globalists.
[00:18:23.453 --> 00:18:24.734]  They must first play God.
[00:18:24.734 --> 00:18:31.237]  They must first prove that they are the fittest in their social Darwinistic system.
[00:18:31.237 --> 00:18:32.658]  And in a way, they're right.
[00:18:32.658 --> 00:18:40.361]  If we let them lie to us and dumb us down and poison us and destroy our children's futures, the evidence is overwhelming and out in the open.
[00:18:40.361 --> 00:18:42.983]  We really deserve what's happened to us.
[00:18:44.053 --> 00:18:50.557]  So I ask you now, are you going to step up and expose the new old order even more?
[00:18:50.557 --> 00:18:54.199]  I know I'm pledging to step up and redouble my efforts.
[00:18:54.199 --> 00:18:56.320]  The front lines of the fight is InfoWars.com
[00:18:59.039 --> 00:19:13.577]  The COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience, a symbol of slavery, a symbol of the change that the medical tyranny combine controlled by the global private corporations has put in place.
[00:19:14.398 --> 00:19:19.681]  It is the symbol of the permanent emergency from which we will never emerge.
[00:19:19.681 --> 00:19:28.425]  It is the symbol that we are diseased and evil and bad and must cover our diseased criminal faces from the light of the sun.
[00:19:28.425 --> 00:19:35.988]  It is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to evil.
[00:19:35.988 --> 00:19:39.430]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are crossing the Rubicon now.
[00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:43.833]  The entire future destiny of humanity is upon us.
[00:19:43.833 --> 00:19:50.178]  Klaus Schwab and the UN admit they're coming out with implantable microchips as part of the World ID and carbon taxes.
[00:19:50.178 --> 00:19:52.240]  Things only get worse from here if we submit.
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:55.822]  They only get better if we resist and say no.
[00:19:55.822 --> 00:20:01.747]  Noncompliance, noncompliance, noncompliance.
[00:20:01.747 --> 00:20:04.349]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:10.419 --> 00:20:11.880]  I'm good.
[00:20:40.081 --> 00:20:46.126]  How about we just play some Rammstein today?
[00:20:46.126 --> 00:20:49.770]  It's a very rough song, but very pretty lyrics.
[00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:52.712]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:52.712 --> 00:21:05.183]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live October 19th, 2021 transmission that the power structure is working as hard as it can to shut down.
[00:21:07.193 --> 00:21:10.116]  Okay, let me tell you what we got coming up for you today.
[00:21:10.116 --> 00:21:13.539]  I was on Steven Crowder's show a few weeks ago in Dallas.
[00:21:13.539 --> 00:21:14.841]  Loved the show.
[00:21:14.841 --> 00:21:17.563]  Super funny, super talented, super smart crew.
[00:21:17.563 --> 00:21:22.929]  And of course, their main star, Steven Crowder, who is a shining star of Liberty.
[00:21:22.929 --> 00:21:24.550]  And they've told him a lot that if he
[00:21:26.155 --> 00:21:55.715]  Criticizes the anointed protected group amongst all the protected groups is the trans male the males that give up their Masculinism to become female they believe and I don't hate people that want to do that or say that I do hate them probably the center of attention and take over my life and Go into women's bathrooms and show their penises to people because there is that group of them doing that that the media is defending And and also raping women inside, you know bathroom stalls and the press even covers for that as you know
[00:21:56.955 --> 00:22:00.236]  Well, he's been told, don't you dare talk about it anymore.
[00:22:00.236 --> 00:22:04.138]  When, you know, men go to prison saying they're a woman, they go, oh, you're a woman?
[00:22:04.138 --> 00:22:08.239]  Oh, well, we'll just put you in a prison so you can rape and impregnate women.
[00:22:08.239 --> 00:22:18.763]  He dared criticize that, so they gave him another strike, and one more, he's banned off YouTube, where he's as big as Joe Rogan ever was on YouTube.
[00:22:18.763 --> 00:22:20.703]  Everything he does gets millions of views.
[00:22:20.703 --> 00:22:22.604]  That's despite all of them shadowbanning him.
[00:22:24.013 --> 00:22:32.235]  So a lot of people say, hey Alex, you know, all you talk about is the Great Reset and the carbon tax and the forced vaccines and all of that.
[00:22:32.235 --> 00:22:34.576]  We really like it when you talk about the culture wars.
[00:22:34.576 --> 00:22:36.637]  Well, you know, the COVID thing is the big culture war.
[00:22:36.637 --> 00:22:37.897]  It's the big takeover.
[00:22:37.897 --> 00:22:39.317]  It's the divide and conquer tactic.
[00:22:39.317 --> 00:22:45.739]  It's the blaming people that don't take the shots for all the sicknesses and while the globalists actually depopulate the general public.
[00:22:45.739 --> 00:22:47.940]  I mean, this is the big extermination move.
[00:22:50.748 --> 00:22:57.110]  But it is important to look at the other aspects they've got to depopulate and deindustrialize the West.
[00:22:57.110 --> 00:23:02.052]  And in China, they have a one-child policy where they kill the little girls mainly.
[00:23:02.052 --> 00:23:05.313]  In some towns, they have two to one boys born in the last 30 years in China.
[00:23:05.313 --> 00:23:05.993]  They've gotten rid of that.
[00:23:05.993 --> 00:23:06.814]  Now they have three children.
[00:23:06.814 --> 00:23:11.955]  The government wants them to have, because now they've broken with the globalists to a great extent, at least in that policy.
[00:23:11.955 --> 00:23:12.816]  They're now going with a more
[00:23:14.531 --> 00:23:24.779]  Race-based type system that you would call more nationalistic in the vernacular, but a race-based nationalism.
[00:23:24.779 --> 00:23:40.352]  But here, you need to understand that at the end of the day from the Tavistock Institute and from the Carnegie Endowment and from the CIA, they developed and deployed this transgenderism in the 50s, began to gestate it in the 60s, and began deploying it in the 70s, 80s, and 90s.
[00:23:42.546 --> 00:23:53.011]  As the West one-child policy, if you can't kill one of the children before they're ever born or keep them from being born, you need to kill their fertility.
[00:23:53.011 --> 00:24:06.397]  And if you give girls or boys puberty blockers or physically chop off and mutilate their genitals, their ovaries or their testicles, then they do become a genetic eunuch.
[00:24:07.569 --> 00:24:07.769]  I think?
[00:24:22.865 --> 00:24:23.145]  I think?
[00:24:44.085 --> 00:24:45.866]  of human-animal hybrids.
[00:24:45.866 --> 00:24:52.310]  Well, they first got you to get you to accept Caitlyn Jenner, who looks like an old, evil snapping turtle with a big wig on.
[00:24:53.476 --> 00:25:00.022]  Or drag queen story time with convicted pedophiles all over the country, in many cases, dressed up like It the Clown.
[00:25:00.022 --> 00:25:01.423]  Scarier than It the Clown.
[00:25:01.423 --> 00:25:07.468]  I expect them to be hiding in a drainage ditch somewhere, you know, with little kids out there playing with their paper boat.
[00:25:07.468 --> 00:25:12.673]  And you go set your kids on the altar of their swollen crotches.
[00:25:12.673 --> 00:25:14.074]  We have all the videos of this.
[00:25:14.074 --> 00:25:16.236]  That is a ritual, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:17.281 --> 00:25:21.945]  To make you praise it, to make you be part of the in-group, because you'll praise something you know is a fraud.
[00:25:21.945 --> 00:25:25.488]  Like, oh, you're twice as likely to get sick or die from the vaccine.
[00:25:25.488 --> 00:25:29.151]  That's the federal government's own numbers.
[00:25:29.151 --> 00:25:30.552]  But CNN says it's safe and effective.
[00:25:30.552 --> 00:25:32.733]  That's gaslighting.
[00:25:32.733 --> 00:25:37.858]  So, here is the banned video from YouTube.
[00:25:37.858 --> 00:25:41.621]  And I'd love to take the credit and say, oh, the most banned guy on the internet, Alex Jones, is the reason he got the strike.
[00:25:41.621 --> 00:25:42.842]  No, it's specifically
[00:25:44.073 --> 00:25:46.115]  For the skit they did that I was part of.
[00:25:46.115 --> 00:25:49.777]  I'm just not going to take the credit here because I don't get the credit.
[00:25:49.777 --> 00:25:50.978]  Here is a piece of that.
[00:25:50.978 --> 00:25:53.300]  We'll come back with the man, Steven Crowder.
[00:26:01.724 --> 00:26:03.345]  Are we ready though?
[00:26:03.345 --> 00:26:04.825]  I don't know that I'm ever ready.
[00:26:04.825 --> 00:26:06.006]  I don't know that we want to be ready.
[00:26:06.006 --> 00:26:20.292]  But the Women's Liberation Front, I already hate this, it's the worst, reported at least one woman at the Central California Women's Facility was pregnant after a male, transgender male prisoner was transferred there.
[00:26:20.292 --> 00:26:23.913]  Keep in mind, the male prisoner was permitted to transfer under the new California law SB 132.
[00:26:25.334 --> 00:26:27.875]  Which allows biological males.
[00:26:27.875 --> 00:26:29.676]  We're not supposed to use the term biological males now.
[00:26:29.676 --> 00:26:30.697]  What's the term we're supposed to use?
[00:26:30.697 --> 00:26:31.857]  Uh, person with penis or something?
[00:26:31.857 --> 00:26:32.037]  Person?
[00:26:32.037 --> 00:26:32.717]  Yeah.
[00:26:32.717 --> 00:26:34.318]  No, it's something else, man.
[00:26:34.318 --> 00:26:35.599]  Lady McBulls?
[00:26:35.599 --> 00:26:37.580]  Yes.
[00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:38.440]  Seating person?
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:39.180]  Yeah.
[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:42.942]  Seating per... Is that what a seating person... No, I just made that up.
[00:26:42.942 --> 00:26:44.663]  I heard, but I had read at Vox
[00:26:45.734 --> 00:26:47.395]  That it's hateful to say biological males.
[00:26:47.395 --> 00:26:47.835]  So I don't know.
[00:26:47.835 --> 00:26:48.535]  They're a different term.
[00:26:48.535 --> 00:26:49.275]  Like Latinx.
[00:26:49.275 --> 00:26:51.316]  Go say that to the Latin Kings.
[00:26:51.316 --> 00:26:52.016]  See how it turns out.
[00:26:52.016 --> 00:26:52.436]  Yeah.
[00:26:52.436 --> 00:26:53.497]  Let us know what the term is.
[00:26:53.497 --> 00:26:56.058]  Sooner or later, someone's getting nine teardrop tattoos.
[00:26:56.058 --> 00:26:57.598]  They just look like Pierrots.
[00:26:57.598 --> 00:26:59.959]  Used to call them dad.
[00:26:59.959 --> 00:27:06.842]  So under SB 132, it allows biological males to use women's locker rooms, homeless shelters, and prisons.
[00:27:06.842 --> 00:27:07.522]  That's a good thing.
[00:27:07.922 --> 00:27:10.723]  To the point that now condoms have been issued within the prison.
[00:27:10.723 --> 00:27:12.083]  What?
[00:27:12.083 --> 00:27:18.965]  Yeah, this is part of the protocol to ensure that sex between inmates, which is illegal, by the way, would be safe.
[00:27:18.965 --> 00:27:22.506]  So they need to make sure that it's safe sex in an all-females prison.
[00:27:22.506 --> 00:27:22.987]  Wow.
[00:27:22.987 --> 00:27:30.949]  Where they cannot get pregnant, and so... All women.
[00:27:30.949 --> 00:27:31.389]  Condoms.
[00:27:31.389 --> 00:27:33.430]  Pregnancy.
[00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:34.410]  Immaculate conception?
[00:27:41.747 --> 00:27:52.434]  Do not be afraid, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which will be to all people, for there is born to you a baby in this cell.
[00:27:52.434 --> 00:27:56.256]  And this shall be a sign unto you of... A virgin birth?
[00:27:56.256 --> 00:27:57.376]  A miracle?
[00:27:57.376 --> 00:27:58.717]  Ha, no.
[00:27:58.717 --> 00:28:03.780]  Your cellmate, that guy dressed as a woman?
[00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:06.102]  He's going to rape you.
[00:28:06.102 --> 00:28:08.943]  I'm a girl.
[00:28:08.943 --> 00:28:09.704]  Repeatedly.
[00:28:13.536 --> 00:28:14.877]  That read rough on the paper.
[00:28:14.877 --> 00:28:16.438]  It really did, yes.
[00:28:16.438 --> 00:28:17.918]  And who could have seen this coming?
[00:28:17.918 --> 00:28:22.341]  And good old Alex Jones as an argument to soften the blow.
[00:28:22.341 --> 00:28:23.141]  He did a great job.
[00:28:23.141 --> 00:28:24.302]  I don't apologize for it.
[00:28:24.302 --> 00:28:29.004]  I see a whole Con Air remake where prisoners just try to get swapped over to the women's prison.
[00:28:29.004 --> 00:28:29.924]  We're not trying to get free!
[00:28:29.924 --> 00:28:31.245]  Is Alex Jones in that remake?
[00:28:31.245 --> 00:28:31.765]  I want to watch it.
[00:28:31.765 --> 00:28:34.607]  I would absolutely go to a women's jail instead.
[00:28:34.607 --> 00:28:39.229]  They'll recast Nicolas Cage as the new Nicolas Cage with the hair transplant.
[00:28:39.229 --> 00:28:39.870]  Right.
[00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:40.650]  The drunk one?
[00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:40.910]  Yeah.
[00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:41.791]  I'm still crazy.
[00:28:43.031 --> 00:28:47.576]  I'm still on the plane, but I have more hair!
[00:28:47.576 --> 00:28:51.699]  All right, funniest show on the internet and TV.
[00:28:51.699 --> 00:28:55.623]  The good old Steven Crowder coming up on the other side.
[00:28:55.623 --> 00:28:56.104]  Stay with us.
[00:28:57.708 --> 00:29:01.749]  Hey everybody, confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture?
[00:29:01.749 --> 00:29:02.509]  Me too.
[00:29:02.509 --> 00:29:09.632]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling, there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[00:29:09.632 --> 00:29:13.613]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death.
[00:29:14.013 --> 00:29:15.914]  You probably already believe that.
[00:29:15.914 --> 00:29:16.914]  I certainly do.
[00:29:16.914 --> 00:29:17.874]  So here's the thing.
[00:29:17.874 --> 00:29:26.757]  I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based substances actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[00:29:26.757 --> 00:29:32.199]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at StrongerDefense.com.
[00:29:32.199 --> 00:29:33.259]  No cures or treatments there.
[00:29:33.539 --> 00:29:42.741]  Instead, little known but shocking immune system research and a breakthrough immune support product based on that research called Immune 10X.
[00:29:42.741 --> 00:29:43.662]  And the best part?
[00:29:43.662 --> 00:29:50.383]  You can go to the Stronger Defense website right now and claim your own supply of Immune 10X without paying anything today.
[00:29:50.383 --> 00:29:51.224]  Crazy, right?

[00:29:55.205 --> 00:29:56.685]  That's StrongerDefense.com.
[00:29:58.621 --> 00:30:02.422]  Back in stock, down-and-out liquid sleep support.
[00:30:02.422 --> 00:30:03.783]  It's been out of stock for a while.
[00:30:03.783 --> 00:30:07.564]  It's one of three sleep aids we have at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:30:07.564 --> 00:30:08.785]  This one has been very popular.
[00:30:08.785 --> 00:30:09.945]  It's sold off the shelves.
[00:30:09.945 --> 00:30:13.827]  It's back in stock, down-and-out liquid sleep support.
[00:30:13.827 --> 00:30:19.689]  This is probably the strongest sleep aid that we have, I would say.
[00:30:19.689 --> 00:30:22.590]  Knockout, RocketRest, both great.
[00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:23.991]  Comes in pill form.
[00:30:23.991 --> 00:30:27.472]  This is the liquid tincture, and I think this is probably the most powerful one.
[00:30:27.992 --> 00:30:29.993]  Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine.
[00:30:29.993 --> 00:30:35.916]  This is, if you haven't done an iodine challenge yet, if you haven't done the iodine challenge, what are you waiting for?
[00:30:35.916 --> 00:30:36.917]  Now is the time.
[00:30:36.917 --> 00:30:43.621]  Super Male and Super Female Vitality Living Defense Plus and the Organic Greens Fiber Caps.
[00:30:43.621 --> 00:30:48.543]  We have a limited supply of these right now, but we want to sell them all out so we can order a new batch.
[00:30:48.543 --> 00:30:52.886]  It was very popular, the Organic Greens Fiber Caps, but we have all kinds of other great supplements.
[00:30:54.727 --> 00:31:17.103]  I am taping this update on the morning of Tuesday, October 19th, 2021, to let all of our great radio and TV listeners know that BODY's Ultimate Turmeric Formula that's been sold out for a long time is back in stock with a 95% curcuminoid level that's so good for inflammation and more.

[00:31:21.907 --> 00:31:24.510]  That's BODY's Ultimate Tumor Formula.
[00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:26.172]  Back in stock.
[00:31:26.172 --> 00:31:28.294]  40% off for a limited time at m4restore.com.
[00:31:28.294 --> 00:31:30.296]  And VasoBeats is selling out fast.
[00:31:30.296 --> 00:31:33.239]  So good for your heart, your lungs, the cardiovascular system.
[00:31:33.239 --> 00:31:34.620]  Creates nitrous oxide in the blood.
[00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:36.782]  It's a really strong concentrate as well.
[00:31:36.782 --> 00:31:37.043]  It's 50% off.
[00:31:38.524 --> 00:31:38.864]  Thank you.
[00:31:59.079 --> 00:32:04.481]  It was almost 15 years ago that I released my seminal film, In Gang Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:32:04.481 --> 00:32:17.445]  And in that documentary, I predicted the globalists would establish world government by releasing a virus, demanding that there be worldwide lockdowns, and then triggering a collapse of our industrial society.
[00:32:17.445 --> 00:32:19.126]  And now they've done it.
[00:32:19.126 --> 00:32:20.226]  How did I know they would do it?
[00:32:20.226 --> 00:32:25.988]  Because they wrote books and white papers, and many of their own reports and internal meetings were leaked.
[00:32:26.926 --> 00:32:36.937]  You see, then I was tracking the Bilderberg Group, whose head at the time was Klaus Schwab, and our sources inside were confirming to us that they were indeed planning to launch this Great Reset.
[00:32:36.937 --> 00:32:38.098]  Well, we're now living in it.
[00:32:38.098 --> 00:32:44.444]  The purposeful collapse of the third world and the first world, on its ass, is a tyrannical corporate world government.
[00:32:44.444 --> 00:32:48.309]  The total censorship, no due process, destruction of the family,
[00:32:49.019 --> 00:32:56.082]  And then incrementally more and more deadly injections of poison masquerading as vaccines to poison us and depopulate us.
[00:32:56.082 --> 00:32:57.602]  This is what InfoWars is fighting.
[00:32:57.602 --> 00:33:01.684]  We're fighting for the future.
[00:33:01.684 --> 00:33:04.345]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:19.226 --> 00:33:24.489]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[00:33:49.184 --> 00:33:51.392]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, we've got him.
[00:33:51.392 --> 00:33:54.020]  He is... The Evil.
[00:33:54.918 --> 00:34:09.583]  Steven Crowder censored, ladies and gentlemen, by YouTube yet again for daring to talk about that third rail that is untouchable, that most protected of all groups, men, that are basically taking over women's spaces.
[00:34:09.583 --> 00:34:14.525]  And Dave Chappelle dared to say that it's like white guys wearing blackface pretending to be black.
[00:34:14.525 --> 00:34:17.306]  Well, that's what it's like having men saying they're women.
[00:34:17.306 --> 00:34:19.367]  So joining us is Steven Crowder.
[00:34:19.867 --> 00:34:22.711]  Well, you're the reason that I'm gone, so I guess I'm thanking you.
[00:34:35.939 --> 00:34:37.060]  I don't apologize for it.
[00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:38.120]  I think it was hysterical.
[00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:42.122]  And I think, you know what, looking back, I don't know if I would have had you playing Gabriel.
[00:34:42.122 --> 00:34:44.302]  That seems to have gotten us into some hot water.
[00:34:44.302 --> 00:34:45.243]  Well, absolutely.
[00:34:45.243 --> 00:34:46.903]  I mean, my family loved it.
[00:34:46.903 --> 00:34:47.644]  The listeners loved it.
[00:34:47.644 --> 00:34:48.204]  The viewers loved it.
[00:34:48.204 --> 00:34:50.385]  Thanks for letting us play it.
[00:34:50.385 --> 00:34:54.226]  Why do you think that upset them so badly?
[00:34:54.226 --> 00:34:58.068]  Well, here's the interesting thing, Alex, is there's a carve-out on YouTube for comedy.
[00:34:58.729 --> 00:35:02.253]  To be clear, there is a carve-out for comedy as far as protected speech.
[00:35:02.253 --> 00:35:16.688]  So this, obviously, I think Alex Jones playing the angel Gabriel, letting Mary know in a cell that it won't be a virgin birth, but a transgen... Look, I don't even need to finish the premise, and it's very clearly meant to be a joke.
[00:35:16.688 --> 00:35:17.729]  Not only that, Alex...
[00:35:18.449 --> 00:35:29.113]  You were here, you know that on that show, the whole joke was we were tiptoeing around the fact that we couldn't even acknowledge the differences between biological men who identify as women versus women, and that's the premise for an immaculate conception.
[00:35:29.113 --> 00:35:34.294]  So the whole joke is a not-joke, that we can't actually make the joke.
[00:35:34.294 --> 00:35:44.538]  And the interesting thing, Alex, is I don't know if you guys have the overlays from this, but the lawyer from YouTube, and I said this yesterday, I find some solace in the fact that they're a very expensive hourly attorney,
[00:35:45.337 --> 00:36:11.908]  Sent a letter specifying what infraction we committed and coincidentally it happened to go up Immediately just hours after we did an entire show on the Loudoun County situation You know the transgender the boy sorry the bisexual boy in a skirt who raped multiple girls in Loudoun County We got the notification or sorry the the letter from the lawyer immediately afterward but in there they said you cannot and of course insert here incite violence commit hate speech, but then it said
[00:36:12.891 --> 00:36:17.599]  Or indicate that transgender individuals may pose a rape threat to women.
[00:36:18.544 --> 00:36:23.747]  That language encompasses everything on the topic of bathroom bills.
[00:36:23.747 --> 00:36:33.813]  That language, just to be clear, what's so concerning to me is there were a hundred parents, right, at Loudoun County who were protesting the school board because this young girl was raped by a bisexual boy in a skirt.
[00:36:33.813 --> 00:36:35.654]  I don't really know what gender they consider that.
[00:36:35.654 --> 00:36:36.874]  That's how it was reported.
[00:36:36.874 --> 00:36:41.657]  But parents wanted a protest in general saying, well, we are opposed to this.
[00:36:41.657 --> 00:36:42.658]  Why are you opposed to this?
[00:36:42.658 --> 00:36:45.659]  Parents at a town hall, parents at a PTA meeting.
[00:36:45.659 --> 00:36:46.520]  We think that letting
[00:36:47.523 --> 00:36:53.685]  Well, I mean, actually, the father went to protest about the reported rape of his daughter by the man in the skirt, and they did arrest him.
[00:36:53.685 --> 00:36:55.905]  They did put him in handcuffs.
[00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:15.792]  And so really, this is out of control.
[00:37:15.792 --> 00:37:20.596]  And then we learned he'd been transferred to another school where another rape reportedly happened.
[00:37:20.596 --> 00:37:25.879]  And then Yahoo News tried to say it didn't exist, but later had to admit, OK, there are two police reports.
[00:37:25.879 --> 00:37:27.601]  There have been arrests.
[00:37:27.601 --> 00:37:40.090]  And so just like the guy out at the spa in L.A., the Asian spa, who went into the hot tub with the grandma, the mother, and the nine-year-old girl and talked about sex, turned out he was a convicted sex offender.
[00:37:41.371 --> 00:37:44.092]  And to be clear, I want to be really clear about something here.
[00:37:44.092 --> 00:37:47.952]  I have never, ever said that all transgender people are rapists.
[00:37:47.952 --> 00:37:52.393]  I've never even said, and wouldn't say, that most transgender people are racist.
[00:37:52.393 --> 00:37:52.793]  Why?
[00:37:52.793 --> 00:37:54.114]  Because I don't believe it.
[00:37:54.114 --> 00:38:04.516]  Now, I think some are, and I think some, even heterosexual males who are predators, will use it as a guise to commit acts of sexual assault.
[00:38:04.716 --> 00:38:12.881]  I don't care how someone actually identifies, I care about mitigating the risk of sexual assault in female-only spaces.
[00:38:12.881 --> 00:38:16.444]  That's the concern here, and people try to say that it's anti-trans.
[00:38:16.444 --> 00:38:19.366]  No, look, we're at a certain point where it's pro-women.
[00:38:19.366 --> 00:38:22.188]  That's really what we're talking about, and this is incredibly concerning.
[00:38:22.928 --> 00:38:24.448]  Keep in mind, that guy was vilified.
[00:38:24.448 --> 00:38:26.509]  We're talking about the dad whose daughter was raped.
[00:38:26.509 --> 00:38:27.049]  Okay?
[00:38:27.049 --> 00:38:28.049]  Let's be really clear about this.
[00:38:28.049 --> 00:38:29.229]  The daughter was raped.
[00:38:29.229 --> 00:38:30.530]  Let's put this in context, everybody.
[00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:35.231]  The FBI, DOJ wants to investigate parents for complaining at town hall meetings.
[00:38:35.231 --> 00:38:36.031]  Okay.
[00:38:36.031 --> 00:38:38.851]  I want you to put yourself in this guy's shoes.
[00:38:38.851 --> 00:38:40.192]  Your daughter's raped.
[00:38:40.192 --> 00:38:42.072]  By the way, confirmed by a rape test kit.
[00:38:42.072 --> 00:38:43.812]  This isn't just a Me Too bad date thing.
[00:38:43.812 --> 00:38:45.633]  People can look it up, okay?
[00:38:45.633 --> 00:38:46.713]  Your daughter's raped.
[00:38:46.713 --> 00:38:49.554]  The school board does nothing.
[00:38:49.554 --> 00:38:51.674]  You think you do a little bit more than protest angrily?
[00:38:52.492 --> 00:38:53.312]  Come on, guys.
[00:38:53.312 --> 00:38:55.553]  This is just people trying to sit and judge.
[00:38:55.553 --> 00:38:59.814]  When we talk about not being judgmental, how about we put ourselves in the shoes of that dad?
[00:38:59.814 --> 00:39:04.835]  You guys are gonna judge him as though he's a threat to society because he got unruly because his daughter was raped?
[00:39:04.835 --> 00:39:09.737]  We have entire films that use that as the premise for us to get on board with the good guy.
[00:39:09.737 --> 00:39:11.097]  It was called Death Wish.
[00:39:11.577 --> 00:39:15.678]  So it's just amazing to me that we try and act as though both sides of this equation.
[00:39:15.678 --> 00:39:17.619]  No, not both sides of the equation.
[00:39:17.619 --> 00:39:18.219]  One side.
[00:39:18.219 --> 00:39:20.720]  A father's daughter was raped by something that was preventable.
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:22.100]  The school did nothing about it.
[00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:23.601]  They didn't want to acknowledge it.
[00:39:23.601 --> 00:39:24.641]  And this is what they always do, right?
[00:39:24.641 --> 00:39:26.502]  They say, well, hold on a second.
[00:39:26.502 --> 00:39:32.864]  You can acknowledge specific instances of sexual assault where it's happened.
[00:39:32.864 --> 00:39:34.204]  And then they say, but it's never happened.
[00:39:34.901 --> 00:39:35.942]  Just like I said at a school board.
[00:39:35.942 --> 00:39:41.525]  Well, you can't make any broad generalizations, which is what would be required to oppose this policy before it happens, right?
[00:39:41.525 --> 00:39:46.489]  And they say, but you're allowed to cite specific examples of individuals.
[00:39:46.489 --> 00:39:48.330]  And then you go to the school board and say, okay, what about this?
[00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:49.771]  They say, that never happened.
[00:39:49.771 --> 00:39:51.071]  That's the issue that we're talking about.
[00:39:51.071 --> 00:39:54.594]  When you go to the California State Prison System, you say, okay, what about these pregnancies?
[00:39:54.594 --> 00:39:55.935]  Well, that never happened.
[00:39:55.935 --> 00:39:58.736]  We don't have evidence that it was from a transgender individual.
[00:39:58.736 --> 00:40:00.317]  We just know a woman got pregnant in prison.
[00:40:00.317 --> 00:40:01.378]  Oh, okay, alright.
[00:40:01.378 --> 00:40:03.279]  Well, I thought we were following the science.
[00:40:03.279 --> 00:40:04.040]  So, my mistake.
[00:40:05.213 --> 00:40:09.644]  Well I know this, we're playing a clip from the famous Alfred Hitchcock film.
[00:40:10.942 --> 00:40:17.326]  Psycho with Norman Bates dressed as his mother who he had dead stuffed in the basement with cabbage leaves.
[00:40:17.326 --> 00:40:24.790]  And so all I'm saying is we've known throughout culture and history that a lot of crazy people both in fiction and non-fiction like to dress up as women.
[00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:29.753]  Also a lot of pedophiles like to dress up as women to trick children into their white raper vans.
[00:40:29.753 --> 00:40:38.539]  I mean this has all come out so there's this leftist Hollywood fetish with men dressing up like women coming after women and children and there is a certain percentage of predators
[00:40:39.079 --> 00:40:41.021]  Well, let's also be clear about something with the rules.
[00:40:41.021 --> 00:40:44.463]  There are also plenty of men who dress up like women who don't identify as women.
[00:40:44.463 --> 00:40:45.924]  I mean, think of Hoover, right?
[00:40:45.924 --> 00:40:50.508]  There are plenty of men who have done this in the past, and the issue here now is it's kind of difficult
[00:41:05.109 --> 00:41:18.179]  Honestly, for someone, a layman, to go, okay, this person is simply a cross-dresser, but this person is transgender, this person is transsexual, because most transgender individuals don't go through with the bottom surgery.
[00:41:18.179 --> 00:41:20.140]  A lot of them don't go through with the top surgery.
[00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:22.202]  They simply dress and identify as women.
[00:41:22.202 --> 00:41:30.508]  But it would be considered grossly offensive to imply that they are a cross-dresser, a transvestite, which at one point was just sort of something that people did.
[00:41:30.508 --> 00:41:33.170]  So the issue here is really, it's the elimination of
[00:41:34.444 --> 00:41:38.148]  Gender lines, the elimination of this idea that men and women are fundamentally different.
[00:41:38.148 --> 00:41:43.673]  The idea that children do best, ideally, in a household with a mother and a father.
[00:41:43.673 --> 00:41:45.074]  And I want to be clear about this, too.
[00:41:45.074 --> 00:41:52.020]  I think, look, when you're talking about a group, transgender individuals, who have a 40-plus attempted suicide rate, between 41 and 42,
[00:41:53.485 --> 00:41:55.667]  Uh, and it's about the same thing post-op.
[00:41:55.667 --> 00:41:58.788]  I do think that there needs to be compassion for these groups of people.
[00:41:58.788 --> 00:41:59.689]  Absolutely.
[00:41:59.689 --> 00:42:02.331]  Because no other group has an attempted suicide rate.
[00:42:02.331 --> 00:42:10.716]  American slaves didn't have a 41 to 42 percent attempted suicide rate, which tells me again, I think some transgender individuals are treated horribly and I would never do that.
[00:42:10.716 --> 00:42:18.821]  But they're not, as a whole, treated worse than American slaves, which may suggest there's something internally that we can help with.
[00:42:18.821 --> 00:42:19.321]  Absolutely.
[00:42:19.321 --> 00:42:19.982]  Stay right there.
[00:42:20.202 --> 00:42:28.470]  Steven Crowder's trying to help people, so am I. I'm not enemies with men that are confused, but there are predators posing as women, and the left is defending it.
[00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:29.671]  Why are they defending it?
[00:42:29.671 --> 00:42:32.334]  How do we stop this nightmare?
[00:42:32.334 --> 00:42:33.314]  Where is all this going?
[00:42:33.314 --> 00:42:36.818]  Straight ahead with Steven Crowder, who I don't hear saying hate.
[00:42:36.818 --> 00:42:41.502]  I hear him saying truth, and that's why they want to silence him, because they want to silence all of us.
[00:42:41.502 --> 00:42:42.023]  We'll be right back.
[00:42:44.343 --> 00:42:52.085]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with poisons and chemicals added to the foods.
[00:42:52.085 --> 00:42:53.586]  It's all come out.
[00:42:53.586 --> 00:43:00.347]  And they're doing that not because we're weak, but because we're made in the image of God, the Creator, and we are powerful.
[00:43:00.347 --> 00:43:03.588]  And the social engineers fear that so much.
[00:43:03.588 --> 00:43:09.370]  So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up with, but boy, is it true.
[00:43:11.263 --> 00:43:17.048]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[00:43:17.048 --> 00:43:29.279]  They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural death because they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on to the god of this world who is a loser.
[00:43:29.819 --> 00:43:33.000]  One of the most studied and researched areas of human health and physiology is inflammation.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.220]  It's associated with cancer.
[00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:35.921]  It's associated with joint problems.
[00:43:35.921 --> 00:43:38.181]  It's associated with viral infections, bacterial infections.
[00:43:38.181 --> 00:43:38.962]  It's associated with death.
[00:43:57.987 --> 00:44:06.233]  Out of all the incredible compounds that God gave us through nature that fights inflammation and makes our lives better, turmeric is chief amongst them all.
[00:44:06.233 --> 00:44:11.897]  And chief amongst all the turmeric products out there is Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[00:44:11.897 --> 00:44:12.998]  My wife loves turmeric.
[00:44:12.998 --> 00:44:17.481]  She has joint pain, but she has to take a lot of it, the type of stuff she buys at the grocery store, for it to work.
[00:44:17.941 --> 00:44:20.962]  She started taking this and said, I only need to take one pill instead of four.
[00:44:20.962 --> 00:44:22.163]  Why is it so good?
[00:44:22.163 --> 00:44:23.484]  It's not just turmeric.
[00:44:23.484 --> 00:44:26.565]  It's concentrated with a proprietary process.
[00:44:26.565 --> 00:44:33.308]  It's back in stock for being sold out almost five months at InfoWarsTore.com for 40% off.
[00:44:33.308 --> 00:44:38.691]  But supplies are going to sell out quick because of supply chain breakdowns and because we will not lower the quality of this product.
[00:44:38.691 --> 00:44:42.052]  And Vonage is one of our best selling products because it really does work and people love it.

[00:44:45.157 --> 00:44:54.601]  I'm taping this message on the morning of Tuesday, October 19th, 2021, and I've got some great news to report to the listeners.
[00:44:54.601 --> 00:45:05.726]  For at least one week, we're going to be able to run a sale with Bodhi's Ultimate Turmeric Formula that just got back in stock after being sold out almost five months because of supply chain breakdowns.
[00:45:05.726 --> 00:45:09.627]  It has a 95% curcuminoid level.
[00:45:09.627 --> 00:45:13.169]  Most of the turmeric supplements have a 5% to 10% curcuminoid level.
[00:45:13.909 --> 00:45:17.291]  Our leading competitor has a 75% humanoid level.
[00:45:17.291 --> 00:45:20.313]  This is a special proprietary concentrate.
[00:45:20.313 --> 00:45:25.655]  It is so good for inflammation, for your immune system, as an antioxidant for your whole body.
[00:45:25.655 --> 00:45:26.976]  It's documented.
[00:45:26.976 --> 00:45:28.417]  It's amazing.
[00:45:28.417 --> 00:45:31.679]  Everybody knows that turmeric is an incredible thing that God created.
[00:45:31.679 --> 00:45:33.500]  And bodies is the strongest and best.
[00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:37.122]  You're gonna find, and it's back in stock, and it funds the info war.
[00:45:38.383 --> 00:45:41.284]  40% off for a limited time, and it goes back to regular price right now.
[00:45:41.284 --> 00:45:42.785]  DempfulWorkshore.com.
[00:45:42.785 --> 00:45:48.149]  We're running this special for one week.
[00:45:48.149 --> 00:45:49.390]  Jacob in Ohio.
[00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:49.790]  Welcome.
[00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:50.210]  Go ahead.
[00:45:50.210 --> 00:45:51.531]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[00:45:51.531 --> 00:45:52.091]  Good, bro.
[00:45:52.091 --> 00:45:53.192]  Great last caller.
[00:45:53.192 --> 00:45:56.234]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[00:45:56.234 --> 00:46:01.938]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, demoralization, and absurdity.
[00:46:01.938 --> 00:46:03.499]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[00:46:04.019 --> 00:46:05.721]  All right, Eric in New Hampshire.
[00:46:05.721 --> 00:46:06.663]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[00:46:06.663 --> 00:46:07.023]  Go ahead.
[00:46:07.023 --> 00:46:07.444]  Hey, Alex.
[00:46:07.444 --> 00:46:08.565]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:46:08.565 --> 00:46:11.609]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for the point of the product.
[00:46:11.609 --> 00:46:13.271]  The X Team does wonders.
[00:46:13.271 --> 00:46:14.432]  I recommend it to everybody.
[00:46:14.432 --> 00:46:15.594]  You're on the fence about it.
[00:46:15.594 --> 00:46:16.395]  Get off the fence.
[00:46:16.395 --> 00:46:17.076]  Get the product.
[00:46:17.076 --> 00:46:18.498]  Support the info war.
[00:46:18.498 --> 00:46:19.779]  Tyler in Maine.
[00:46:19.779 --> 00:46:20.440]  You're on the air.
[00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:20.941]  Thanks for calling.
[00:46:20.941 --> 00:46:21.101]  Go ahead.
[00:46:21.121 --> 00:46:23.063]  Hey Alex, it's great to be on with you.
[00:46:23.063 --> 00:46:23.803]  It's an honor.
[00:46:23.803 --> 00:46:24.084]  Honor.
[00:46:24.084 --> 00:46:24.624]  Talk to you.
[00:46:24.624 --> 00:46:25.765]  Awesome.
[00:46:25.765 --> 00:46:29.208]  So, first thing I wanted to do is say I love the products.
[00:46:29.208 --> 00:46:31.450]  Alpha Power, even at 29.
[00:46:31.450 --> 00:46:35.294]  If you ask my better half, she loves it and it helps in the bedroom.
[00:46:35.294 --> 00:46:37.076]  So, just number one for a few weeks.
[00:46:37.076 --> 00:46:37.956]  It definitely works.
[00:46:37.956 --> 00:46:39.578]  It's not a joke.
[00:46:39.578 --> 00:46:40.298]  Absolutely.
[00:46:47.879 --> 00:46:50.541]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:17.205 --> 00:47:25.398]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is the Alex Jones Show, and I'm really honored that you've joined us on this October 19th, 2021 transmission.
[00:47:25.398 --> 00:47:29.544]  We've got Steven Crowder on, who is being mean to women.
[00:47:29.544 --> 00:47:30.446]  He's a bully.
[00:47:30.446 --> 00:47:31.888]  He gangs up on girls.
[00:47:32.569 --> 00:47:39.533]  And he did a piece criticizing biological men, women, in prisons getting other women pregnant.
[00:47:39.533 --> 00:47:39.873]  We know it.
[00:47:39.873 --> 00:47:43.975]  All it takes is two women to have a baby.
[00:47:43.975 --> 00:47:48.617]  And so, you were finishing up with the fact that, societally, what are we going to do about this?
[00:47:48.617 --> 00:47:54.620]  Because, yeah, other men that have a proclivity to feel like they're women, and some are hermaphroditic, and so, okay, you're a woman.
[00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:55.661]  Fine, I don't hate you.
[00:47:55.661 --> 00:47:56.621]  I'm not attacking you.
[00:47:56.621 --> 00:47:58.422]  That's my genuine feelings as well.
[00:47:58.422 --> 00:48:00.123]  But what are they going to do about all the predators
[00:48:00.863 --> 00:48:03.105]  Uh, that are basically in charge of their movement.
[00:48:03.105 --> 00:48:05.767]  This is, this is, this is going to cause quite an explosion.
[00:48:05.767 --> 00:48:07.569]  I think it already is.
[00:48:07.569 --> 00:48:10.431]  Yeah, and there's, by the way, there's a big rift in the feminist movement.
[00:48:10.431 --> 00:48:17.597]  The Women's, I think, Liberation Front, Lear Keith, who I had on the show maybe seven years ago because she was a former vegan, I believe, is at work with this.
[00:48:17.597 --> 00:48:24.323]  So there are feminists now who are reaching out and saying, you know what, I disagree with a lot of the things that you've said in the past, but I understand it.
[00:48:24.323 --> 00:48:27.646]  Look, you know, this is something that I, what I think is important for people to note
[00:48:29.227 --> 00:48:32.229]  I'm sorry, it's the fault of suburban white women.
[00:48:32.229 --> 00:48:33.350]  I blame you.
[00:48:33.350 --> 00:48:34.210]  People don't understand this.
[00:48:34.210 --> 00:48:37.052]  When you talk about transgender individuals in sports, for example, okay?
[00:48:37.052 --> 00:48:38.973]  Biological men going into women's sports.
[00:48:38.973 --> 00:48:40.935]  Most women support it.
[00:48:40.935 --> 00:48:42.456]  Most men oppose it.
[00:48:42.456 --> 00:48:43.696]  Time and time again.
[00:48:43.696 --> 00:48:45.237]  Even though we don't have a dog in the fight.
[00:48:45.237 --> 00:48:49.840]  Now, the reason we oppose it is not because we hate transgender individuals.
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:53.423]  It's for the same reason that we don't want to see men beating up on women.
[00:48:54.123 --> 00:48:55.363]  Yep, it's quite that simple.
[00:48:55.363 --> 00:48:56.844]  So look, let's just look at it this way.
[00:48:56.844 --> 00:49:01.325]  Let's remove the label, and we're talking about the bathroom situation, of transgender, whatever it is.
[00:49:01.325 --> 00:49:05.826]  It's just, okay, let's say I'm a sexual predator, right, and I'm attracted to women.
[00:49:05.826 --> 00:49:07.466]  Let's just assume that for a second.
[00:49:07.466 --> 00:49:15.288]  And I could be a straight, white male, or I could be a male-to-female, transgender, lesbian-slash-your-guess-is-as-good-as-mine.
[00:49:15.288 --> 00:49:18.629]  Let's just not get too, let's not get too nerdy on the math here.
[00:49:18.629 --> 00:49:23.210]  What's the best way to remove opportunity of getting vulnerable women alone?
[00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:27.331]  Is making sure we protect some women-only spaces.
[00:49:27.331 --> 00:49:28.211]  That's it!
[00:49:28.211 --> 00:49:29.071]  That's all it is.
[00:49:29.071 --> 00:49:33.672]  And if you're pro-women, you have to understand where people are coming from with that.
[00:49:33.672 --> 00:49:43.355]  Let's stop calling the insinuation that having women-only spaces should all... So, let's use the term, no penis spaces.
[00:49:44.341 --> 00:49:44.861]  Is that okay?
[00:49:44.861 --> 00:49:45.362]  Can we use that?
[00:49:45.362 --> 00:49:45.802]  Can I say that?
[00:49:45.802 --> 00:49:46.402]  I know it's on radio.
[00:49:46.402 --> 00:49:47.163]  I can say penis, right?
[00:49:47.163 --> 00:49:48.103]  Because it's medically.
[00:49:48.103 --> 00:49:49.024]  No penis spaces.
[00:49:49.024 --> 00:49:49.664]  That's it.
[00:49:49.664 --> 00:49:53.586]  I am pro-everyone and pro-no penises in women's only spaces.
[00:49:53.586 --> 00:49:54.467]  It's a penis-free space.
[00:49:54.467 --> 00:50:00.090]  I mean, now the colleges have white-free spaces where no whites are allowed to go, where people, you know, need these bastions.
[00:50:00.090 --> 00:50:02.391]  Can't women have no penis spaces?
[00:50:02.391 --> 00:50:05.693]  Like, women have... You would think... Women have gyms that are just for women.
[00:50:05.693 --> 00:50:06.313]  And I get that.
[00:50:06.313 --> 00:50:09.495]  So they can go be left alone and not have to worry how they look for men.
[00:50:09.495 --> 00:50:10.835]  And men have their own gyms.
[00:50:10.835 --> 00:50:11.736]  There's nothing wrong with that.
[00:50:12.566 --> 00:50:17.312]  Actually, the truth is, I don't think there are many male-only gyms.
[00:50:17.312 --> 00:50:18.473]  Those are just gay nightclubs.
[00:50:20.356 --> 00:50:21.277]  It's very, very rare.
[00:50:21.277 --> 00:50:22.238]  Because I've looked for them.
[00:50:22.238 --> 00:50:27.002]  Because the truth is, now if you go to men and women, I actually think it's a good idea, like curves.
[00:50:27.002 --> 00:50:29.644]  I understand it because women feel vulnerable, right?
[00:50:29.644 --> 00:50:30.685]  They feel self-conscious.
[00:50:30.685 --> 00:50:31.927]  I'm actually pro-curves.
[00:50:31.927 --> 00:50:37.612]  And sometimes I would like a male-only gym where it doesn't scare women if you drop a barbell.
[00:50:37.612 --> 00:50:38.372]  That's all.
[00:50:38.372 --> 00:50:39.714]  I think that it should go above and beyond the promise.
[00:50:39.714 --> 00:50:40.194]  I totally agree.
[00:50:40.194 --> 00:50:40.554]  Exactly.
[00:50:40.554 --> 00:50:42.396]  That's why guys go out to the deer camp.
[00:50:42.396 --> 00:50:44.258]  So they can drink whiskey, chew tobacco, and cuss.
[00:50:46.274 --> 00:50:51.937]  I do know three of those things, but I like to paint with watercolors, so I think I understand where you're coming from.
[00:50:51.937 --> 00:50:53.578]  Exactly.
[00:50:53.578 --> 00:50:56.800]  Yeah, we're both equally manly, is my point, Alex.
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:51:01.903]  No, look, and this is the elimination of... To give you an example, you know, Dave Rubin is someone who I've had on my show.
[00:51:01.903 --> 00:51:04.665]  People know Dave Rubin is a gay sort of libertarian.
[00:51:04.665 --> 00:51:06.766]  And I spoke with him a long time ago about gay marriage.
[00:51:07.429 --> 00:51:13.610]  And he was very surprised, because when I met Dave, I gave him a big hug, and I really do, he's just a really nice guy, and I do, I genuinely love Dave Rubin.
[00:51:13.610 --> 00:51:18.071]  I try and reflect the love that Christ has given to me, because I don't deserve it.
[00:51:18.071 --> 00:51:21.892]  And you're having a baby when he's six months pregnant, right?
[00:51:21.892 --> 00:51:24.372]  Yes, and we plan on chest feeding, just to be clear.
[00:51:24.372 --> 00:51:25.813]  No Similac for us.
[00:51:25.813 --> 00:51:27.873]  I don't trust what they put in there, lead or something.
[00:51:27.873 --> 00:51:31.254]  Well, you saw a blue judge and his husband in the bed at the maternity ward.
[00:51:32.837 --> 00:51:33.478]  I know, I know.
[00:51:33.478 --> 00:51:36.000]  And I just had twins, so believe me, I know.
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:37.241]  Here's the best part.
[00:51:37.241 --> 00:51:40.603]  He took two months off, and no one even noticed.
[00:51:40.603 --> 00:51:44.747]  So, that just tells you how useless most roles are in government.
[00:51:44.747 --> 00:51:45.447]  But here's the deal.
[00:51:45.447 --> 00:51:55.335]  What's funny to me, to go down this path, because Tucker Carlson said something about breastfeeding, and then he responded, Pete Buttigieg, very snippily on CNN saying,
[00:51:55.795 --> 00:51:57.817]  I guess Tucker hasn't heard of bottle feeding.
[00:51:57.817 --> 00:51:58.878]  No, no, wait!
[00:51:58.878 --> 00:52:04.342]  We wouldn't assume that all men bottle feed because you have told us that men can breastfeed too.
[00:52:04.342 --> 00:52:09.586]  We just showed a video of that today on the show of transgender men breastfeeding.
[00:52:09.586 --> 00:52:14.210]  So this is the problem now is the left can't even agree to their own premises.
[00:52:14.210 --> 00:52:17.853]  Pete Buttigieg is trying to say, of course we know men can't breastfeed.
[00:52:17.853 --> 00:52:18.813]  Well, guess what?
[00:52:18.813 --> 00:52:24.498]  Vox and BuzzFeed and CNN and NBC say that some men can breastfeed.
[00:52:26.624 --> 00:52:32.725]  And AOC says that cauliflower is racist because it's white.
[00:52:32.725 --> 00:52:33.846]  That's not a joke, by the way, folks.
[00:52:33.846 --> 00:52:34.966]  We missed that.
[00:52:34.966 --> 00:52:36.566]  Seriously, though, pulling back from this.
[00:52:36.566 --> 00:52:38.067]  Did she actually say that?
[00:52:38.067 --> 00:52:39.147]  Did she actually say that?
[00:52:39.147 --> 00:52:42.788]  Yeah, she said we shouldn't be growing at the inner city gardens cauliflower.
[00:52:42.788 --> 00:52:46.208]  That's a white food.
[00:52:46.208 --> 00:52:47.469]  Oh.
[00:52:47.469 --> 00:52:49.969]  She was looking at a cross-eyed, so she probably didn't know what she was talking about.
[00:52:49.969 --> 00:52:50.389]  Exactly.
[00:52:50.389 --> 00:52:51.970]  And she also said the world's ending in 2030.
[00:52:53.908 --> 00:52:55.509]  Yeah, well, look, here's the thing.
[00:52:55.509 --> 00:52:57.030]  AOC is an idiot.
[00:52:57.030 --> 00:53:01.693]  And I don't want to just use ad hominem, but read the Green New Deal.
[00:53:01.693 --> 00:53:06.216]  You can read it more quickly than the pamphlet they give you at Discount Tire.
[00:53:06.216 --> 00:53:09.118]  And I think you kind of understand everything you need to know.
[00:53:09.118 --> 00:53:11.740]  If she actually said that, this is the first I'm hearing about it.
[00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:14.161]  Cauliflower, you know what?
[00:53:14.161 --> 00:53:18.444]  Cauliflower is one of those things that should bridge all racial divides.
[00:53:20.413 --> 00:53:22.394]  Yes, also heroin, by the way.
[00:53:22.394 --> 00:53:25.555]  Heroin is one thing that white people and black people do equally.
[00:53:25.555 --> 00:53:27.276]  You have certain drugs that are bigger in certain areas, right?
[00:53:27.276 --> 00:53:29.957]  You had the crack epidemic, which was largely African-American back in the day.
[00:53:29.957 --> 00:53:33.619]  A lot of the Califlowers, remember a few years ago, they were saying milk is racist because it's white.
[00:53:33.619 --> 00:53:37.721]  But pulling back from the Steven Crowder, let's get back to the transgenderism.
[00:53:37.721 --> 00:53:40.182]  I played for TV viewers, radio listeners obviously couldn't see it.
[00:53:40.182 --> 00:53:46.665]  The American psycho or psycho clip from Alfred Hitchcock of the man dressed up as the woman going around killing people.
[00:53:47.845 --> 00:53:56.587]  What about even in Silence of the Lambs where it's a transgender that's got the woman down in the pit trying to get her to put lotion on the skin?
[00:53:56.587 --> 00:54:01.669]  Why do we archetypally just think of a man dressed up as a woman as kind of a psycho?
[00:54:01.669 --> 00:54:03.649]  Because we've actually seen that in the real world.
[00:54:03.649 --> 00:54:05.130]  That's why art's imitating life.
[00:54:05.130 --> 00:54:06.250]  What do you think about that phenomenon?
[00:54:09.539 --> 00:54:10.920]  I mean, I don't know about that phenomenon.
[00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:16.323]  I know that we've seen it in films, and obviously the trans community opposes it, but I also think that... The reason why?
[00:54:16.323 --> 00:54:18.305]  The reason why it's been portrayed that way?
[00:54:18.305 --> 00:54:19.706]  I will say, historically?
[00:54:19.706 --> 00:54:22.227]  For example, let's just let people make their own judgments.
[00:54:22.227 --> 00:54:27.810]  I will say the reason why black people were portrayed a certain way may have been because of racism at these points in history.
[00:54:27.810 --> 00:54:35.235]  But I will say this, the reason why a lot of serial killers were portrayed that way, or villains, is because the scene is abnormal.
[00:54:35.235 --> 00:54:35.855]  What do you mean?
[00:54:35.855 --> 00:54:38.517]  Atypical, against the norm, rare.
[00:54:39.119 --> 00:54:39.639]  That's why.
[00:54:39.639 --> 00:54:42.660]  A man dressing up as a woman is rare, and it was seen as abnormal.
[00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:50.862]  And there's a big push right now to not only make sure that that is seen as the exact same as a biological woman, but so is a man breastfeeding a child.
[00:54:50.862 --> 00:54:51.503]  And you know what?
[00:54:51.503 --> 00:54:52.823]  Science really does matter.
[00:54:52.823 --> 00:54:56.964]  When people say, follow the science, while we're talking about vaccines, for example, people say, follow the science.
[00:54:56.964 --> 00:54:58.505]  And by that, what they mean is Fauci.
[00:54:58.505 --> 00:54:59.305]  And I don't want to get into that.
[00:54:59.305 --> 00:55:00.205]  I'm not a doctor.
[00:55:00.205 --> 00:55:01.626]  I think people have the right to make their own decisions.
[00:55:01.626 --> 00:55:04.206]  But what really does matter is they say, follow the science.
[00:55:04.206 --> 00:55:04.806]  Okay.
[00:55:04.806 --> 00:55:06.347]  When it comes to the idea of
[00:55:07.388 --> 00:55:09.831]  Men chest-feeding, the term they use.
[00:55:09.831 --> 00:55:12.634]  How about you follow... Are we gonna follow the science here?
[00:55:12.634 --> 00:55:15.577]  Because if you do that, the child will die.
[00:55:15.577 --> 00:55:16.658]  Doesn't matter how you feel.
[00:55:16.658 --> 00:55:21.744]  You chest-feed, you breast-feed, you're a man, to a baby, the baby's going to die.
[00:55:21.744 --> 00:55:22.365]  That's the science.
[00:55:23.095 --> 00:55:26.417]  So at one point, just like with Fauci and AIDS, okay, people don't know this.
[00:55:26.417 --> 00:55:41.827]  You know, I'm sure your audience does, obviously, Alex, but the right to try, this term that people talk about, that came to popularity under Fauci with gay men who had AIDS and, for example, there's Dallas Buyers Club where they wanted to be able to use off-label medications.
[00:55:41.827 --> 00:55:44.689]  And Fauci blocked it and made them take AZT to kill them.
[00:55:45.723 --> 00:55:53.447]  And they wanted the right to try things like basic immunosuppressants, anabolic steroids for wasting diseases, marijuana for appetite, right?
[00:55:53.447 --> 00:55:55.228]  And Fauci said, no, AZT.
[00:55:55.228 --> 00:55:56.689]  And they said, we just want the right to try.
[00:55:56.689 --> 00:55:57.490]  So here's the deal.
[00:55:57.490 --> 00:56:03.073]  Back then, Fauci, and this is political correctness, wanted to make sure that he didn't hurt any gay men's
[00:56:03.633 --> 00:56:04.193]  Feelings, right?
[00:56:04.193 --> 00:56:09.376]  He said there is no connection between the homosexual lifestyle and the outbreak of AIDS.
[00:56:09.376 --> 00:56:14.058]  He said one in five heterosexual couples would be affected by AIDS before 1995, I believe.
[00:56:14.058 --> 00:56:20.060]  So, Fauci, in the name of science, wanted to avoid hurting gay men's feelings.
[00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:22.201]  I don't want more gay men to die!
[00:56:23.129 --> 00:56:25.111]  You guys determine who's the bad guy.
[00:56:25.111 --> 00:56:26.092]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[00:56:26.092 --> 00:56:28.694]  But if you pull back with Fauci, it's worse than that.
[00:56:28.694 --> 00:56:29.955]  They knew there were all those treatments.
[00:56:29.955 --> 00:56:33.498]  That's why Magic Johnson started taking AZT, felt sick, and he said, I'm done.
[00:56:33.498 --> 00:56:34.779]  He's still alive today.
[00:56:34.779 --> 00:56:42.425]  Everybody else who took the AZT that Fauci brought back, just like- By the way, by the way, Magic Johnson, straight as an arrow.
[00:56:44.571 --> 00:56:48.013]  Well, I'm not sure about that, but who knows?
[00:56:48.013 --> 00:56:54.738]  I mean, I know this, black people can get HIV a lot easier than white people, according to studies, because of the receptor science.
[00:56:54.738 --> 00:56:56.379]  Let's just move on, Alex.
[00:56:56.379 --> 00:56:57.680]  That's the science, straight as an arrow.
[00:56:58.985 --> 00:57:00.985]  Okay, we're going to go to break with Steven Crowder.
[00:57:00.985 --> 00:57:04.546]  One more little segment with him, and then he's literally going to a Bible study.
[00:57:04.546 --> 00:57:10.767]  And he's got an amazing wife and two great twins, and has one of the funniest shows in the world that I'm very, very envious of.
[00:57:10.767 --> 00:57:14.348]  I mean, seriously, folks, we do an hour and a half live, four weeks a day.
[00:57:14.348 --> 00:57:15.488]  No, four weeks a day.
[00:57:15.488 --> 00:57:16.989]  Four days a week.
[00:57:16.989 --> 00:57:20.890]  And it's really super funny, because he hardly ever messes up like I just did.
[00:57:20.890 --> 00:57:22.190]  And it's live!
[00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:23.590]  That's pretty amazing.
[00:57:23.590 --> 00:57:25.291]  So I'm a big fan of the Steven Crowder Show.
[00:57:25.291 --> 00:57:27.471]  We'll be right back on the other side in two minutes.
[00:57:34.585 --> 00:57:56.820]  The technocrats, the social engineers, the behavioral psychologists, they're all part of the same satanic, globalist, control freak system that seeks to play God, that seeks to turn the general population of this earth into their slaves, into putty, into clay in their hands that they control.
[00:57:56.820 --> 00:58:04.005]  And chief amongst their physical attacks is keeping us from high quality vitamins and minerals that are essential for life on this planet.
[00:58:04.765 --> 00:58:11.048]  And so, the information we cover exposes their evil works and sabotages their globalist takeover.
[00:58:11.048 --> 00:58:14.809]  And we're having an incredible effect thanks to your support and your word of mouth.
[00:58:14.809 --> 00:58:21.252]  But it's also important to take care of our bodies themselves with high-quality water filtration at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:58:21.252 --> 00:58:31.136]  And with amazing supplements, many of which that just came back in stock, like Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, now 40% off for a limited time at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:58:31.136 --> 00:58:33.517]  So let's fight the info war, but also take care of our bodies.
[00:58:37.555 --> 00:58:47.162]  Because of the globalist reset, InfoWars listeners and viewers know a lot of our best-selling products have been sold out in some cases for up to a year.
[00:58:47.162 --> 00:58:54.028]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula with 95% Curcuminoid has been sold out for almost five months.
[00:58:54.028 --> 00:58:56.930]  Because again, the high-quality turmeric and the concentration process
[00:58:57.350 --> 00:58:58.130]  We're good to go.
[00:59:17.776 --> 00:59:19.417]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:59:50.947 --> 00:59:51.568]  We're good to go.
[01:00:17.051 --> 01:00:18.112]  That's Steven Crowder.
[01:00:18.112 --> 01:00:19.332]  I didn't watch on Monday.
[01:00:19.332 --> 01:00:20.273]  I missed that.
[01:00:20.273 --> 01:00:20.933]  Damn.
[01:00:20.933 --> 01:00:22.674]  And so here's a clip of what he had to say.
[01:00:22.674 --> 01:00:26.335]  It's a big deal getting a country music star on, but Travis Tritt is really alive.
[01:00:26.335 --> 01:00:27.476]  There's a lot of courage.
[01:00:27.476 --> 01:00:30.477]  And just the whole interview that I ended up watching this morning, Tom, I didn't have it.
[01:00:30.477 --> 01:00:30.878]  I watched it.
[01:00:30.878 --> 01:00:31.458]  It was amazing.
[01:00:31.458 --> 01:00:33.079]  Here's part of it.
[01:00:33.079 --> 01:00:37.601]  You gave the statement not too long ago about how important our freedoms and our liberties are.
[01:00:37.601 --> 01:00:42.283]  I'm kind of surprised that you would think it wouldn't be that big of a risk in the country music community.
[01:00:43.246 --> 01:00:52.078]  Sometimes I'm surprised at some of the ass-kissing that seems to take place in the country community to the media elites, because what you said, a lot of people supported it, a lot of people didn't.
[01:00:52.078 --> 01:00:53.120]  I'm sure I'm not giving you any news.
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:57.586]  Can you tell people who missed it what it was and why you felt you wanted to speak out about this?
[01:00:57.586 --> 01:00:58.687]  Well, basically, when...
[01:01:00.413 --> 01:01:10.655]  When Eric Clapton made the statement about the freedoms being infringed upon, that really resonated with me.
[01:01:10.655 --> 01:01:11.295]  Yeah.
[01:01:11.295 --> 01:01:25.037]  And I basically agreed with him across the board, aside from the personal effects that he had had from getting the vaccine.
[01:01:25.037 --> 01:01:25.877]  Right.
[01:01:25.877 --> 01:01:28.098]  But I just agreed just from a
[01:01:30.111 --> 01:01:36.433]  A philosophical standpoint about we have to preserve our freedoms.
[01:01:36.433 --> 01:01:50.218]  We've never been in a situation that I know of in this country where the government has been allowed to force you to take medicine that you may or may not need.
[01:01:51.445 --> 01:01:56.648]  And the whole interview is amazing, and what he said to the Daily Wire is powerful.
[01:01:56.648 --> 01:02:04.133]  I mean, it's great to see all these people that have politically not been, you know, too active really being now forced to come out and being so eloquent.
[01:02:04.133 --> 01:02:09.516]  So I'm just, you know, so much support to what Travis Tritt did.
[01:02:09.516 --> 01:02:11.457]  Yeah, and by the way, I'm sorry, I had some audio problems.
[01:02:11.457 --> 01:02:12.378]  Can you guys all hear me now?
[01:02:12.378 --> 01:02:13.639]  Yes, sir, we can hear you.
[01:02:13.639 --> 01:02:14.459]  Okay, good.
[01:02:14.459 --> 01:02:15.360]  You know what, Alex?
[01:02:16.457 --> 01:02:35.769]  I gotta tell you, this is the first time, it kind of breaks my heart that Rolling Stone, I guess, went after Travis Tritt, because this is something, and you know my heart, and people know this, like I've talked about how you and I disagree a lot and we agree on a whole lot too, and you know that after the YouTube, the deplatforming, I probably didn't agree with you on as much as some people who I felt
[01:02:37.185 --> 01:02:37.706]  Thank you.
[01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:50.740]  Yeah.
[01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:31.793]  Make sure it was crystal clear and everything that he said was reasonable, was loving, and it just breaks my heart that Rolling Stone is distorting it.
[01:03:31.793 --> 01:03:34.656]  There's nothing that Travis Tritt said that anyone could disagree with.
[01:03:34.656 --> 01:03:36.418]  He didn't say don't take the vaccine.
[01:03:36.418 --> 01:03:39.582]  He didn't say Bill Gates is using it as a mind-control chemical agent.
[01:03:39.582 --> 01:03:40.443]  He just talked about
[01:03:41.375 --> 01:03:52.219]  Not being comfortable with forcing attendees to his show who may or may not be able to get this medicine, you know, having them barred from his live performances.
[01:03:52.219 --> 01:03:55.041]  And now he's getting attacked, but that's a badge of honor to be attacked.
[01:03:55.041 --> 01:03:58.302]  If you're not being attacked now, you're not doing something right.
[01:03:58.522 --> 01:04:08.411]  Yeah, but you know what, I guess it's just because I know what, uh, and this is the first time I met him, and by the way, for people who don't know, he has appeared on other episodes of the show and sketches, kind of like yourself, too.
[01:04:08.411 --> 01:04:10.713]  It's sort of like a Dean Martin Variety Hour in this, in that sense.
[01:04:10.713 --> 01:04:17.439]  We'll have these celebrities appear in sketches, like, it's one of the funniest things, Alex, that I've ever done, having you be the angel Gabriel.
[01:04:17.439 --> 01:04:19.642]  I still laugh about it, but I will say this.
[01:04:21.744 --> 01:04:22.345]  It really does.
[01:04:22.345 --> 01:04:27.851]  But honestly, it breaks my heart because he's such a sweet man and he was... Anyway, I just encourage... You know what?
[01:04:27.851 --> 01:04:34.858]  The only thing I can do is encourage people to watch the full interview because I never want... Look, if someone says something, obviously, there's accountability.
[01:04:34.858 --> 01:04:37.301]  When people say there's no cancel culture, there's accountability culture.
[01:04:37.301 --> 01:04:38.502]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:04:38.502 --> 01:04:40.264]  There is a difference because everyone... No, you're right.
[01:04:40.264 --> 01:04:41.605]  Steven Crowder, we're out of time.
[01:04:41.605 --> 01:04:42.526]  Come back again soon.
[01:04:42.526 --> 01:04:43.187]  Thank you so much.
[01:04:45.514 --> 01:05:08.329]  I am taping this update on the morning of Tuesday, October 19th, 2021, to let all of our great radio and TV listeners know that Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula that's been sold out for a long time is back in stock with a 95% curcuminoid level that's so good for inflammation and more for 40% off for a limited time that it goes back to regular price in one week.

[01:05:29.583 --> 01:05:30.364]  This is amazing.

[01:05:31.184 --> 01:05:32.505]  DNA Force Plus.

[01:05:53.893 --> 01:06:00.336]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:08.092 --> 01:06:18.757]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now into hour number two, and I have got so much just amazing news and interesting information to cover.
[01:06:18.757 --> 01:06:22.298]  And I have a real frustration here on air that I'll just vent with all of you.
[01:06:24.406 --> 01:06:26.888]  I usually host three hours, sometimes I host four hours of the show.
[01:06:26.888 --> 01:06:28.729]  I do things different than other people.
[01:06:28.729 --> 01:06:31.531]  I have a three-hour syndicated show, but sometimes I like to do a fourth hour.
[01:06:31.531 --> 01:06:35.834]  And so we have guests hosting the fourth hour just in case something big breaks.
[01:06:35.834 --> 01:06:42.478]  And because the people I have on that do the fourth hour are people I like and I think are interesting and I think are informative.
[01:06:42.478 --> 01:06:47.721]  So I usually end up eating my lunch and taking care of research in that hour after the show.
[01:06:47.721 --> 01:06:53.045]  So I like to watch and listen to the show just like you do, just I don't like to watch and listen to Alex Jones.
[01:06:54.292 --> 01:06:58.695]  I mean, sometimes I think I'm interesting in things, but I'm not the biggest Alex Jones viewer or listener.
[01:06:58.695 --> 01:07:00.697]  I don't read interviews I'm in.
[01:07:00.697 --> 01:07:02.078]  I don't watch films I'm in.
[01:07:02.078 --> 01:07:05.181]  I don't watch documentaries I'm in, unless I absolutely have to.
[01:07:05.181 --> 01:07:09.384]  It's just something that's a little old.
[01:07:09.384 --> 01:07:12.746]  But I am very, very thankful that you tune in and that you put up with me.
[01:07:12.746 --> 01:07:17.150]  But believe me, I'm the guy that needs to be critiqued.
[01:07:17.150 --> 01:07:23.075]  I'm the guy that has this giant audience of amazing people like you that are awake that the globalists fear.
[01:07:23.976 --> 01:07:31.558]  So, I am extremely honored to be here, and I'll just be completely honest with you.
[01:07:31.558 --> 01:07:40.441]  It's this weird phenomenon that after I've read something a couple times, it's exciting while I'm reading it at 1 a.m.
[01:07:40.441 --> 01:07:42.902]  at my house, or at 4 p.m.
[01:07:42.902 --> 01:07:45.663]  at my office, or at 9 p.m.
[01:07:45.663 --> 01:07:53.485]  at night, but then when it's the next day and I've got all the documents in front of me, it's not that it's not exciting anymore,
[01:07:55.129 --> 01:07:59.837]  It's like, oh my God, it took me two hours to read that.
[01:07:59.837 --> 01:08:01.921]  How am I going to do this justice?
[01:08:02.853 --> 01:08:20.576]  And that's the frustration, is there's so much going on, so much happening, that if I just mention a few of these things here, I mean, hours and hours of research, and don't get it exactly right, I'm almost doing a disservice by conditioning people to all this evil.
[01:08:20.576 --> 01:08:31.818]  Because if you don't get conscious, and drill into it, and really grasp it, and really fundamentally change, and commit to fight this, and commit to become aware of it at a cellular level,
[01:08:33.393 --> 01:08:35.534]  This broadcast actually does bad.
[01:08:35.534 --> 01:08:36.714]  It actually causes harm.
[01:08:36.714 --> 01:08:41.016]  Now, overall, the broadcast causes a lot of positive things to happen.
[01:08:41.016 --> 01:08:54.980]  And the globalists were arrogant a long time ago, and they, a few times I've talked to some of them, they've said, hey, don't worry, we think the public are scum, and we think when you tell them all this stuff, it'll just demoralize them, or scare them, or condition them not to fight back and give up.
[01:08:54.980 --> 01:09:02.143]  Well, I think we've proven that populism and nationalism, and through God's power, and through surrendering to God, that's a daily process,
[01:09:03.624 --> 01:09:06.567]  That we can transcend Satan and the New World Order.
[01:09:06.567 --> 01:09:09.889]  We better or we're all going to be destroyed.
[01:09:09.889 --> 01:09:11.951]  And we see that now that we're coming to the end of the line.
[01:09:11.951 --> 01:09:14.714]  So let me just try to give you an example.
[01:09:14.714 --> 01:09:16.615]  And a lot of times I do this at the start of the show.
[01:09:16.615 --> 01:09:24.582]  And I don't think in all the years I've been on air I've actually ever gotten even through one or two of the stacks of just reading the headlines.
[01:09:24.582 --> 01:09:28.906]  But let me just give you an example of some of the stuff I've got here in my stack.
[01:09:30.373 --> 01:09:37.276]  Country music legend Travis Tritt boycotts any venue or promoter mandating masks, requiring vaccinations, or pushing COVID testing.
[01:09:37.276 --> 01:09:39.517]  I read this like, you know, early in the morning.
[01:09:39.517 --> 01:09:40.877]  The transcript is incredible.
[01:09:40.877 --> 01:09:45.119]  I went and watched like 30 minutes of the interview, and I was like, this guy's incredibly well-spoken.
[01:09:45.119 --> 01:09:47.240]  I mean, I wish I was that well-spoken.
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:52.322]  I'm like, wow, thank God they force people like this, who are smart and talented, off
[01:09:53.789 --> 01:10:01.713]  The bench, and I'm not saying he was being lazy, but off the bench into the political arena, and that's what should scare the globalists.
[01:10:01.713 --> 01:10:07.876]  I could read what he said and play what he said on Crowder for the rest of this hour, and that would be a really important hour of radio.
[01:10:07.876 --> 01:10:11.978]  That's one piece of gold out of hundreds.
[01:10:11.978 --> 01:10:14.320]  Here's another one right here, okay?
[01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:14.840]  Shock!
[01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:22.524]  FDA delays Moderna vax for adolescents citing concerns of microcarditis risk and heart attacks, and it's not rare, it's prominent, and it's serious.
[01:10:23.817 --> 01:10:26.478]  That's in Reuters.
[01:10:26.478 --> 01:10:29.060]  That's in the Gateway Pundit.
[01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:32.401]  That is a whole three-hour show, taking calls.
[01:10:32.401 --> 01:10:39.945]  How are they going to approve something that they admit in the public testing, where they bypass regular trials, is causing massive heart attacks worldwide.
[01:10:39.945 --> 01:10:47.929]  And by the way, Moderna and Pfizer are banned in over 100 countries as of six months ago, plus, and then continuing through, there's new countries banning it every week.
[01:10:48.874 --> 01:10:51.175]  Because it causes damn heart attacks.
[01:10:51.175 --> 01:10:52.796]  And what did all the top scientists say?
[01:10:52.796 --> 01:10:58.580]  I mean, literally, we quoted dozens of them last year saying it's going to cause microcarditis.
[01:10:58.580 --> 01:11:04.584]  Oh, but don't listen to Wolfgang Wudar, don't listen to Dr. Yidan, don't listen to Dr. you know, all of them.
[01:11:04.584 --> 01:11:16.111]  How about the CDC in October with their secret report that got leaked that they later put on their website and admitted that list of adverse reactions that they were predicting was microcarditis and a bunch of other stuff.
[01:11:17.369 --> 01:11:22.590]  Including one disorder where your platelets all disappear and you bleed to death.
[01:11:22.590 --> 01:11:31.432]  And, you know, I've got some family that I've been close to in the past, but they're liberals and they don't really talk to me anymore.
[01:11:31.432 --> 01:11:36.033]  And I remember thinking, man, I wonder if they're all going to take the double jab, how long they'll be alive.
[01:11:36.033 --> 01:11:39.234]  Sure enough, one of them got double jab, dying right now of, uh,
[01:11:40.307 --> 01:11:43.849]  Liquefying the platelets and it's right there.
[01:11:43.849 --> 01:11:46.190]  I played a clip of Dr. Merritt talking about it last hour.
[01:11:46.190 --> 01:11:53.313]  I mean, this is serious business.
[01:11:53.313 --> 01:11:59.877]  Serious business, takes the shots, a few months later going to hospice to die.
[01:11:59.877 --> 01:12:01.418]  Very, very sad and pray for him.
[01:12:03.373 --> 01:12:13.437]  People just can't believe this is happening, so they double down and oh, oh, oh, the two Pfizer shots don't worry, the two Moderna shots don't worry, let me take another one.
[01:12:13.437 --> 01:12:14.657]  Here's another article.
[01:12:14.657 --> 01:12:16.618]  I just covered two.
[01:12:16.618 --> 01:12:21.800]  French clergy sexually abused over 200,000 children and the government covered it up.
[01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:22.160]  Reuters.
[01:12:23.677 --> 01:12:24.498]  A lot worse than that.
[01:12:24.498 --> 01:12:25.779]  Oh, and then this article on the New York Post.
[01:12:25.779 --> 01:12:27.561]  See how they tie together?
[01:12:27.561 --> 01:12:36.309]  Biden's secretly flying underage migrants into New York in dead of night.
[01:12:36.309 --> 01:12:40.353]  And there's all these videos and photos of kids that look as young as seven years old.
[01:12:40.353 --> 01:12:42.815]  And it said, oh, just any charity wants them, gets them.
[01:12:42.815 --> 01:12:45.177]  And then I flash back to four or five months ago.
[01:12:45.177 --> 01:12:47.760]  We're down in McAllen and
[01:12:49.488 --> 01:12:55.190]  They're giving children as young as five years old to men in vans without their mothers.
[01:12:55.190 --> 01:12:57.051]  And a guy walks over and goes, why are you guys against this?
[01:12:57.051 --> 01:12:57.791]  We've got cameras on.
[01:12:57.791 --> 01:13:01.612]  He goes, I'm here to take him to Pennsylvania, show him the way of the Lord.
[01:13:01.612 --> 01:13:04.734]  He's going, Lord, what's wrong with these kids?
[01:13:04.734 --> 01:13:06.854]  Nobody wants these kids, these women.
[01:13:06.854 --> 01:13:08.575]  I'm going to show these women the way of the Lord.
[01:13:08.575 --> 01:13:13.137]  I'm going to take women with me that don't have no children, that don't have no husband.
[01:13:14.158 --> 01:13:17.959]  We had an undercover cop went in, a woman, and was telling us what was happening.
[01:13:17.959 --> 01:13:22.081]  She comes out, he follows her out, and sees us and goes, what are you doing?
[01:13:22.081 --> 01:13:25.842]  Them women and childrens need me to teach them the way of the Lord.
[01:13:25.842 --> 01:13:28.343]  And they load them in vans.
[01:13:28.343 --> 01:13:30.284]  I mean, folks, this is not a movie.
[01:13:30.284 --> 01:13:31.904]  This is not Netflix.
[01:13:31.904 --> 01:13:35.766]  This is the real world.
[01:13:35.766 --> 01:13:41.608]  Unaccompanied children, and then they just load them into vans with the creepiest looking dudes I've ever seen.
[01:13:42.856 --> 01:13:42.996]  Let's
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:03.401]  They're talking about how I want this woman, I want that woman, I want those kids.
[01:14:03.401 --> 01:14:05.161]  I don't want them with any men or boys.
[01:14:05.161 --> 01:14:05.941]  I'm going to teach them.
[01:14:05.941 --> 01:14:07.022]  I'm going to put them to work.
[01:14:07.022 --> 01:14:08.282]  I'm going to learn them.
[01:14:08.282 --> 01:14:11.343]  And I'm not trying to talk like a hillbilly, but they got weird hillbillies in Pennsylvania.
[01:14:11.343 --> 01:14:12.543]  This guy's like, you saw the video.
[01:14:12.543 --> 01:14:16.384]  He's like, he walks that morning.
[01:14:16.384 --> 01:14:17.644]  He looks us up and down.
[01:14:17.644 --> 01:14:18.364]  What's wrong?
[01:14:18.364 --> 01:14:19.664]  I'm trying to get women for me.
[01:14:19.664 --> 01:14:22.965]  I'm going to take them to Pennsylvania, put them to work, show them the Lord.
[01:14:22.965 --> 01:14:25.766]  And then we confirm, no paperwork, no nothing.
[01:14:25.766 --> 01:14:27.966]  He's inside going, I pay good monies.
[01:14:27.966 --> 01:14:29.907]  You said bring down here, I'll get women.
[01:14:31.188 --> 01:14:32.149]  I'm here with women.
[01:14:32.149 --> 01:14:33.671]  I'm here with the Lord.
[01:14:33.671 --> 01:14:37.294]  I mean, you know, I mean, just, okay, that's just one more article.
[01:14:37.294 --> 01:14:38.776]  I mean, every one of them is just horrible.
[01:14:41.604 --> 01:14:44.586]  Oh, you think they just got 200,000 slave kids in France?
[01:14:44.586 --> 01:14:46.987]  Or 30,000 per major city in Germany?
[01:14:46.987 --> 01:14:50.369]  Folks, their religion is raping and then murdering children.
[01:14:50.369 --> 01:14:53.150]  I'm not saying that guy coming out of the place is a pedophile or he does that.
[01:14:53.150 --> 01:14:54.331]  I'm sure he's a wonderful guy.
[01:14:54.331 --> 01:15:01.515]  Just if I was casting someone in a movie, you know, like a Rob Zombie new movie, House of a Thousand Corpses or something, I mean, you know,
[01:15:01.795 --> 01:15:04.077]  People like Casper are not scary at all.
[01:15:04.077 --> 01:15:10.082]  I'd go down to where the people get these kids, I don't know why, but every one of them is the most scary damn looking person I've ever seen.
[01:15:10.082 --> 01:15:11.944]  They all look scarier than Brian Stelter.
[01:15:11.944 --> 01:15:13.846]  They look scarier than Governor Newsom.
[01:15:13.846 --> 01:15:18.169]  I mean, my God, if I was walking down the street, I'd say, that's a child molester, probably a killer.
[01:15:18.169 --> 01:15:20.872]  You know, you'll be pumping gas and you see black, white, doesn't matter.
[01:15:20.872 --> 01:15:22.053]  You go, that person's a hardened criminal.
[01:15:22.053 --> 01:15:23.594]  They're not trying to act like they're a criminal.
[01:15:23.594 --> 01:15:24.775]  You just get the aura.
[01:15:24.775 --> 01:15:28.739]  That's a person that'll hogtie you while they rape your wife and then blow your head off.
[01:15:30.126 --> 01:15:31.528]  I'm here with some women, no men with them.
[01:15:31.528 --> 01:15:33.369]  I'm going to show them the Lord.
[01:15:33.369 --> 01:15:36.172]  Why are you here to stop me?
[01:15:36.172 --> 01:15:36.873]  Who are you?
[01:15:36.873 --> 01:15:39.796]  I just... Nobody wants these women anyways.
[01:15:39.796 --> 01:15:40.917]  Nobody want to make them work.
[01:15:46.616 --> 01:15:48.699]  Your voice counts.
[01:15:48.699 --> 01:15:53.766]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[01:15:53.766 --> 01:15:56.369]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[01:15:56.369 --> 01:15:57.851]  They know you're angry.
[01:15:57.851 --> 01:16:02.678]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[01:17:44.764 --> 01:17:46.986]  Why do my enemies hate me so much?
[01:17:46.986 --> 01:17:48.567]  Why do the globalists hate you so much?
[01:17:48.567 --> 01:17:51.449]  Why do they hate America so much?
[01:17:51.449 --> 01:17:58.914]  Because it's an idea of freedom that their tyrannical system that they're pushing cannot coexist with.
[01:17:58.914 --> 01:17:59.814]  It's very, very simple.
[01:17:59.814 --> 01:18:11.683]  For their world government, their anti-human, post-human, eugenic system to flourish, freedom and liberty and due process and justice and God-fearing systems must fail.
[01:18:12.463 --> 01:18:15.006]  So sure, you didn't start a fight with Bill Gates.
[01:18:15.006 --> 01:18:17.970]  You didn't start a fight with David Rockefeller.
[01:18:17.970 --> 01:18:19.913]  You didn't start a fight with the UN.
[01:18:19.913 --> 01:18:22.937]  They started a fight with you.
[01:18:22.937 --> 01:18:28.724]  And they're not going to back down, and they're not going to go away, and they're not going to ever stop their attacks.
[01:18:29.565 --> 01:18:31.987]  Until they have the fear of God put into them.
[01:18:31.987 --> 01:18:37.792]  But the average person still doesn't even know about the New World Order, or about globalism, or about corporate fascism.
[01:18:37.792 --> 01:18:47.039]  And it's not until people understand that, and that we're under attack, that we have any chance of beating these people.
[01:18:47.039 --> 01:18:52.043]  If you only knew the power of the dark side.
[01:18:52.043 --> 01:18:57.688]  Join Bill Gates, and together, we will defeat humanity.
[01:18:58.922 --> 01:19:04.952]  Then our God Satan will reward us with eternal life.
[01:19:04.952 --> 01:19:07.856]  That's basically the ethos of The Globalist.
[01:19:09.528 --> 01:19:10.810]  They must first play God.
[01:19:10.810 --> 01:19:17.317]  They must first prove that they are the fittest in their social Darwinistic system.
[01:19:17.317 --> 01:19:18.738]  And in a way, they're right.
[01:19:18.738 --> 01:19:26.447]  If we let them lie to us and dumb us down and poison us and destroy our children's futures, the evidence is overwhelming and out in the open.
[01:19:26.447 --> 01:19:29.069]  We really deserve what's happened to us.
[01:19:30.129 --> 01:19:36.632]  So I ask you now, are you going to step up and expose the New Old Order even more?
[01:19:36.632 --> 01:19:40.274]  I know I'm pledging to step up and redouble my efforts.
[01:19:40.274 --> 01:19:48.318]  The front lines of the fight is infowars.com.
[01:19:48.318 --> 01:19:50.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:09.502 --> 01:20:13.444]  Crashing through the lines and disinformation.
[01:20:13.444 --> 01:20:18.987]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:20:18.987 --> 01:20:20.147]  I'm looking down on you.
[01:20:20.147 --> 01:20:23.429]  My laser's trace.
[01:20:23.429 --> 01:20:24.369]  Everything you do.
[01:20:24.369 --> 01:20:27.651]  You think you've got private lives.
[01:20:35.317 --> 01:20:38.218]  I'm Elemental!
[01:20:38.218 --> 01:20:41.019]  My sight is clean!
[01:20:41.019 --> 01:20:42.300]  I am perpetual!
[01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:47.883]  Alright, let's get into it right now.
[01:20:47.883 --> 01:20:58.888]  I've talked about the freak show that is the New World Order and how they're not just gonna do things that are ridiculous and go according to madness and go against common sense.
[01:20:59.980 --> 01:21:12.040]  But they're going to do things like promoting people that don't have the curricula vitae, who don't have the background, and who will also then do whatever they're told, like Pete Buttigieg.
[01:21:13.140 --> 01:21:14.680]  He can be gone three months.
[01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:20.602]  He can get caught staging photo ops where he says he's riding a bike but he was really driving an SUV.
[01:21:20.602 --> 01:21:25.564]  He can call for banning cars or green taxes and you know all the rest is crap.
[01:21:25.564 --> 01:21:27.564]  But it's okay because he's gay.
[01:21:27.564 --> 01:21:28.504]  Oh my goodness.
[01:21:28.504 --> 01:21:29.525]  Okay.
[01:21:29.525 --> 01:21:33.946]  And he can even pose in beds at the hospital saying we just had a baby.
[01:21:36.175 --> 01:21:39.418]  And then he can get, you know, pose in pools wearing a dress or whatever.
[01:21:39.418 --> 01:21:42.641]  It's all supposed to be, oh, well look, it doesn't matter if he's selling us out.
[01:21:42.641 --> 01:21:44.182]  I mean, he's gay.
[01:21:44.182 --> 01:21:46.284]  Like, Tim Cook runs the worst death camps in the world.
[01:21:46.284 --> 01:21:47.585]  But, I mean, he's gay, though.
[01:21:47.585 --> 01:21:49.226]  I mean, my God, it's got to be okay.
[01:21:49.226 --> 01:21:52.489]  Again, black turtledeck sweater, you know, bug eyes, all of it.
[01:21:52.489 --> 01:21:52.850]  It's great.
[01:21:53.430 --> 01:21:55.551]  Well, don't worry though, you gotta top that.
[01:21:55.551 --> 01:22:03.295]  Drag Queen story time, convicted pedophiles, women bringing their children up the altar to put them on their lap and then to roll on them and hump each other.
[01:22:03.295 --> 01:22:04.795]  I mean, we got those videos.
[01:22:04.795 --> 01:22:09.698]  Mainline schools across the country, elementary schools, libraries.
[01:22:09.698 --> 01:22:12.399]  Now the drag queen lays there
[01:22:12.799 --> 01:22:17.503]  And their clown outfit, their demonic clown outfit, it's always a beast, scary-looking dude.
[01:22:17.503 --> 01:22:25.408]  And then the women put their children on their waist and the children wallow in a simulated demonic event.
[01:22:25.408 --> 01:22:29.932]  And they've got like subliminals and blue clues of like human sacrifice to mullet your children.
[01:22:29.932 --> 01:22:31.713]  I mean, this is some heavy-duty stuff.
[01:22:31.713 --> 01:22:36.377]  So, we're already talking about this last hour, where this comes from, what this is.
[01:22:38.263 --> 01:22:39.743]  But here it is.
[01:22:39.743 --> 01:22:42.764]  Imagine if a man, I'm a man, I want to assist your children.
[01:22:42.764 --> 01:22:45.405]  Oh no, that's creepy, that's bad, call the police.
[01:22:45.405 --> 01:22:46.486]  I'm a woman!
[01:22:46.486 --> 01:22:48.366]  I'm dressed up like a woman!
[01:22:48.366 --> 01:22:50.667]  Like Norman Bates in Psycho.
[01:22:50.667 --> 01:22:53.428]  So drumroll please, this is the Washington Post.
[01:22:53.428 --> 01:23:00.130]  This is not a joke, this is not a game, this is not the Onion, this is not the Babylon Bee.
[01:23:00.130 --> 01:23:02.531]  This is real.
[01:23:02.531 --> 01:23:03.431]  Rachel Levine
[01:23:04.736 --> 01:23:11.579]  Openly transgender health official to be sworn in as four-star admiral.
[01:23:11.579 --> 01:23:16.540]  It's like an escape from New York where they go down in the basement of the building and he finds a bum that has the president's tracker.
[01:23:16.540 --> 01:23:17.821]  He goes, Mr. President!
[01:23:17.821 --> 01:23:18.581]  Mr. President!
[01:23:18.581 --> 01:23:21.242]  He looks at him and goes, yeah, I'm the president!
[01:23:21.242 --> 01:23:23.903]  I'm the president!
[01:23:23.903 --> 01:23:25.164]  I'm a four-star admiral!
[01:23:25.164 --> 01:23:28.425]  How about, how about he's a, oh, I'm supposed to call her she, sorry.
[01:23:28.425 --> 01:23:31.126]  She's, she's a naval
[01:23:32.361 --> 01:23:32.961]  Aviator.
[01:23:32.961 --> 01:23:35.503]  She lands on aircraft carriers.
[01:23:35.503 --> 01:23:38.845]  How about she was the first woman to walk on the moon?
[01:23:38.845 --> 01:23:40.586]  It's not true, but let's just say it.
[01:23:40.586 --> 01:23:44.608]  Hell, let's give her Woman of the Year Award, like Caitlyn Jenner was.
[01:23:44.608 --> 01:23:47.050]  Or let's give a Nobel Prize to Obama.
[01:23:47.050 --> 01:23:50.412]  Or let's give one to Henry Kissinger that launched war crimes everywhere and bragged about it.
[01:23:50.412 --> 01:23:55.095]  Hell, let's give Hitler a Southern Poverty Law Center ADL Award.
[01:23:55.095 --> 01:24:01.619]  So, Rachel Levine, openly transgender health official, to be sworn in as four-star admiral.
[01:24:02.694 --> 01:24:08.497]  Darth Vader literally strangled the last one and said, you are in command now, Admiral.
[01:24:08.497 --> 01:24:10.278]  There it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:24:10.278 --> 01:24:13.560]  Can you guys find the psycho clip with audio?
[01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:15.941]  I want to play some of that here in a moment.
[01:24:15.941 --> 01:24:16.521]  Or you know what?
[01:24:16.521 --> 01:24:17.342]  I haven't played it yet.
[01:24:17.342 --> 01:24:19.042]  I mentioned it to Steven Crowder.
[01:24:19.042 --> 01:24:19.723]  Please queue up.
[01:24:21.069 --> 01:24:34.399]  The new little meme, oh before they fact check me at Reuters and say Jones played a fake video of Fauci as the transgender psychopath in Silence of the Lambs with the woman down in the pit saying she rubs the lotion on the skin.
[01:24:34.399 --> 01:24:38.762]  This is called a parody, it's called a meme, it's called a joke.
[01:24:38.762 --> 01:24:45.588]  Which they know, but they fact check even the memes we play and say, Jones tried to get a fake video over on Fauci.
[01:24:45.588 --> 01:24:47.009]  No, that's fake, that's a joke.
[01:24:47.449 --> 01:24:49.291]  This isn't fake right here.
[01:24:49.291 --> 01:24:52.033]  A man saying they're a woman now is an admiral.
[01:24:52.033 --> 01:24:54.815]  I mean, it is a fake man, a fake woman.
[01:24:54.815 --> 01:24:57.537]  Of course, it's totally fake, not really an admiral.
[01:24:57.537 --> 01:25:06.324]  It's just governments, as they begin to collapse, like any third world, but in a republic, start festooning, you know, four, five, six stars on everybody they can.
[01:25:06.324 --> 01:25:08.525]  It's like a dictator in Latin America or something.
[01:25:10.023 --> 01:25:27.795]  A senior, oh senior, oh my god, health appointee who made history when she became the nation's highest-ranking openly transgender official is also set to become its first openly transgender four-star officer.
[01:25:27.795 --> 01:25:32.218]  The administration announced on Tuesday Rachel Levine, a U.S.
[01:25:32.218 --> 01:25:37.641]  Assistant Secretary for Health, will be sworn in Tuesday as an admiral of the U.S.
[01:25:37.641 --> 01:25:39.643]  Public Health Service Commission Corps.
[01:25:41.043 --> 01:25:45.524]  Or outreach to your children, I should add.
[01:25:45.524 --> 01:25:56.786]  A 6,000-person force that responds to health on behalf of the federal government, including administering coronavirus vaccines and delivering care after hurricanes.
[01:25:56.786 --> 01:26:02.767]  Levine is also this generation's first-ever female four-star admiral.
[01:26:02.767 --> 01:26:06.228]  It's the first female four-star admiral!
[01:26:07.310 --> 01:26:10.953]  I thought General Milley was the first female four-star admiral.
[01:26:10.953 --> 01:26:13.455]  Yes, I know General Milley wasn't an admiral.
[01:26:13.455 --> 01:26:14.435]  I know he was in the Army.
[01:26:14.435 --> 01:26:16.437]  It doesn't matter anymore, does it?
[01:26:16.437 --> 01:26:19.299]  What you know is he's a sack of garbage.
[01:26:19.299 --> 01:26:20.180]  Look at this!
[01:26:20.180 --> 01:26:21.301]  Look at this!
[01:26:21.301 --> 01:26:23.883]  We're not supposed to laugh at this.
[01:26:23.883 --> 01:26:30.387]  So, I made the joke that, hey, how about just give him the Woman of the Year Award like they gave Jenner.
[01:26:30.387 --> 01:26:32.209]  The male Olympic athlete.
[01:26:33.541 --> 01:26:34.502]  But they already did.
[01:26:34.502 --> 01:26:38.304]  Look, look, women, don't you feel like you've attained something?
[01:26:38.304 --> 01:26:43.668]  You are now a four-star general.
[01:26:43.668 --> 01:26:57.236]  Finally, in the 240-year history of the United States, 243 years, 243 years, we never had a four-star admiral woman.
[01:26:57.236 --> 01:26:58.557]  Absolute!
[01:26:58.557 --> 01:26:59.418]  Dun-da-dun!
[01:26:59.418 --> 01:27:00.258]  Dun-da-dun!
[01:27:00.258 --> 01:27:01.879]  Dun-da-dun!
[01:27:01.879 --> 01:27:02.560]  Dun-da-dun!
[01:27:05.469 --> 01:27:09.210]  But they're teaching this to children, and it's causing total mental illness.
[01:27:09.210 --> 01:27:11.590]  So, here is the parody of Fauci.
[01:27:11.590 --> 01:27:15.531]  It rubs the lotion on its skin, it takes the vaccine into its... Oh, creepy.
[01:27:15.531 --> 01:27:16.831]  Look at those teeth.
[01:27:16.831 --> 01:27:18.572]  That's general material there.
[01:27:18.572 --> 01:27:28.354]  Man, I mean, look, if you were casting somebody for a serial killer that eats children, or like a demonic alien from space that hatches out of an egg and starts eating children, I mean, central casting, here we come!
[01:27:28.354 --> 01:27:30.994]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:27:30.994 --> 01:27:32.955]  It puts the needle in its skin.
[01:27:32.955 --> 01:27:34.595]  It puts it in whenever it's told.
[01:27:36.152 --> 01:27:37.553]  I'm a pureblood.
[01:27:37.553 --> 01:27:39.133]  I don't want the jab.
[01:27:39.133 --> 01:27:43.495]  I won't take the vax.
[01:27:43.495 --> 01:27:52.278]  It puts the needle in its skin, or else it gets the pink slip.
[01:27:52.278 --> 01:27:55.899]  It puts the needle in its skin.
[01:27:55.899 --> 01:27:57.219]  You can't make me take it!
[01:27:57.219 --> 01:27:58.300]  Please!
[01:27:58.300 --> 01:28:00.220]  Please don't!
[01:28:00.220 --> 01:28:01.761]  It puts the needle in its skin!
[01:28:05.820 --> 01:28:22.269]  You know Fousey stands in front of the mirror and says, I like me, I like me.
[01:28:27.950 --> 01:28:30.011]  Okay, that's just one more story.
[01:28:30.011 --> 01:28:33.452]  I've literally got hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds.
[01:28:33.452 --> 01:28:38.693]  And when we come back... Oh, Fauci's got something special for you.
[01:28:38.693 --> 01:28:43.495]  A virus that kills 80% of people he made on record, and he's getting ready to release it on you.
[01:28:46.826 --> 01:28:53.148]  Have you ever thought about turning your Glock, XD Family, or 1911 handgun into a semi-automatic carbine?

[01:29:48.577 --> 01:29:49.958]  It's been out of stock for a while.
[01:29:49.958 --> 01:29:53.721]  It's one of three sleep aids we have at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:29:53.721 --> 01:29:54.941]  This one has been very popular.
[01:29:54.941 --> 01:29:56.102]  It's sold off the shelves.
[01:29:56.102 --> 01:29:59.984]  It's back in stock, down-and-out liquid sleep support.
[01:29:59.984 --> 01:30:05.848]  This is probably the strongest sleep aid that we have, I would say.
[01:30:05.848 --> 01:30:08.770]  Knockout, RocketRest, both great.
[01:30:08.770 --> 01:30:10.151]  Comes in pill form.
[01:30:10.151 --> 01:30:13.633]  This is the liquid tincture, and I think this is probably the most powerful one.
[01:30:14.153 --> 01:30:16.154]  Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine.
[01:30:16.154 --> 01:30:22.058]  This is, if you haven't done an iodine challenge yet, if you haven't done the iodine challenge, what are you waiting for?
[01:30:22.058 --> 01:30:23.079]  Now is the time.
[01:30:23.079 --> 01:30:25.680]  Super Male and Super Female Vitality.
[01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:29.783]  Living Defense Plus and the Organic Greens Fiber Caps.
[01:30:29.783 --> 01:30:34.706]  We have a limited supply of these right now, but we want to sell them all out so we can order a new batch.
[01:30:34.706 --> 01:30:35.747]  It was very popular.
[01:30:35.747 --> 01:30:37.488]  The Organic Greens Fiber Caps.
[01:30:37.488 --> 01:30:39.049]  But we have all kinds of other great supplements.
[01:30:39.389 --> 01:30:41.552]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[01:30:41.552 --> 01:30:45.539]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[01:30:45.539 --> 01:30:46.140]  It just gets old, man.
[01:30:54.833 --> 01:30:57.254]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[01:30:57.254 --> 01:30:59.556]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[01:30:59.556 --> 01:31:03.578]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[01:31:03.578 --> 01:31:06.880]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:09.562]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[01:31:09.562 --> 01:31:10.923]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[01:31:10.923 --> 01:31:12.043]  Us being shut down?
[01:31:12.043 --> 01:31:13.064]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[01:31:13.504 --> 01:31:14.605]  You know what, Alex?
[01:31:14.605 --> 01:31:15.947]  Hey, put him on pause again!
[01:31:15.947 --> 01:31:16.788]  Hey, Frank!
[01:31:16.788 --> 01:31:22.454]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[01:31:22.454 --> 01:31:26.978]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[01:31:26.978 --> 01:31:30.122]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[01:31:30.122 --> 01:31:30.582]  You understand?
[01:31:30.582 --> 01:31:32.224]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:31:32.224 --> 01:31:33.345]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:31:34.326 --> 01:31:39.959]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars.
[01:31:39.959 --> 01:31:40.661]  Do you understand?
[01:31:40.661 --> 01:31:42.305]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:31:42.305 --> 01:31:43.768]  Free Press needs your help, Frank!
[01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:53.886]  I'm typing this message on the morning of Tuesday, October 19, 2021, and I've got some great news to report to the listeners.
[01:31:53.886 --> 01:32:05.013]  For at least one week, we're going to be able to run a sale with Bobby's Ultimate Turmeric Formula that just got back in stock after being sold out almost five months because of supply chain breakdowns.
[01:32:05.013 --> 01:32:08.915]  It has a 95% curcuminoid level.
[01:32:08.915 --> 01:32:12.458]  Most of the turmeric supplements have a 5% to 10% curcuminoid level.
[01:32:13.198 --> 01:32:16.579]  Our leading competitor has a 75% humanoid level.
[01:32:16.579 --> 01:32:19.600]  This is a special proprietary concentrate.
[01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:24.942]  It is so good for inflammation, for your immune system, as an antioxidant for your whole body.
[01:32:24.942 --> 01:32:26.242]  It's documented.
[01:32:26.242 --> 01:32:27.703]  It's amazing.
[01:32:27.703 --> 01:32:30.944]  Everybody knows that turmeric is an incredible thing that God created.
[01:32:30.944 --> 01:32:32.765]  And bodies is the strongest and best.
[01:32:32.765 --> 01:32:36.466]  You're gonna find, and it's back in stock, and it funds the info war.
[01:32:37.667 --> 01:32:40.709]  40% off for a limited time that goes back to regular price right now.
[01:32:40.709 --> 01:32:47.733]  DempfulWorkshore.com, running the special for one week.
[01:32:47.733 --> 01:32:58.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:32:58.160 --> 01:33:04.204]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:15.251 --> 01:33:38.245]  Wow, they say at major universities here and all over the Western world and on TV ads in the UK that if you invite a girl out or ask her to go have a cup of coffee or tell her she's pretty, that's a micro-rape.
[01:33:41.335 --> 01:33:48.257]  If convicted pedophiles want to come visit your children, in many cases, unannounced at elementary school, that's a good thing.
[01:33:48.257 --> 01:33:50.918]  Yeah.
[01:33:50.918 --> 01:33:54.439]  It's out of control, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:54.439 --> 01:34:01.120]  Yeah, it's not full-grown men with full-grown women saying, relax baby, take it real slow.
[01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:04.701]  It's them doing that with your children, and they're not saying they're going to take it real slow.
[01:34:04.701 --> 01:34:07.862]  It's about destroying their innocence.
[01:34:07.862 --> 01:34:08.803]  Alright, let me do this.
[01:34:08.803 --> 01:34:10.343]  I've covered six or seven news articles.
[01:34:12.192 --> 01:34:24.344]  I've got hundreds of absolutely over-the-top incredible information here for you, and I'm just thinking how entertaining it would be to make fun of Lori Lightfoot, but would that actually save the country or the world?
[01:34:24.344 --> 01:34:30.810]  Or it'd be entertaining to watch CNN and MSNBC and Media Matters attack Tucker Carlson for supporting InfoWars.
[01:34:30.810 --> 01:34:35.474]  That's kind of fun and interesting, but let's not get into Alex Jones.
[01:34:36.643 --> 01:34:43.208]  No, I think we should play 6th grader secretly records teacher peddling critical race theory to class.
[01:34:43.208 --> 01:34:45.309]  We're going to get to that next segment.
[01:34:45.309 --> 01:34:47.311]  And I think we should cover this right now.
[01:34:49.482 --> 01:34:54.225]  And again, some of us are going to say, hey, we're sick of hearing about the COVID.
[01:34:54.225 --> 01:35:03.471]  The COVID takeover is the world ID, the forced inoculations, the mass death, the collapse of civilization, the brainwashing of our children.
[01:35:03.471 --> 01:35:07.353]  It is the shutdown of the economy for the post-industrial world, Great Reset.
[01:35:07.353 --> 01:35:08.294]  They now admit that.
[01:35:08.294 --> 01:35:08.794]  OK?
[01:35:08.794 --> 01:35:18.841]  I mean, it's like, again, if Martians showed up with giant spaceships and cut into our TV feeds and said, we're going to blow the planet up in one hour.
[01:35:21.127 --> 01:35:24.968]  And people said, hey, you didn't pay your month's insurance.
[01:35:24.968 --> 01:35:26.789]  I'm like, yeah, the Martians are going to blow us up in one hour.
[01:35:26.789 --> 01:35:27.569]  We better fight back.
[01:35:27.569 --> 01:35:30.189]  I mean, it's it's everything.
[01:35:30.189 --> 01:35:36.671]  So I can sit here and go, oh, look, here's the new first woman to be a four star admiral.
[01:35:36.671 --> 01:35:37.912]  Do you know who she is?
[01:35:37.912 --> 01:35:41.092]  It's not actually a biological woman that made their way up in the Navy.
[01:35:41.092 --> 01:35:42.693]  No.
[01:35:42.693 --> 01:35:44.653]  This is The Washington Post with a straight face.
[01:35:44.653 --> 01:35:46.734]  It's Rachel Levine, the super creepy dude.
[01:35:51.192 --> 01:35:54.413]  I mean, there's no end to this, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:35:54.413 --> 01:36:06.715]  And see, now the left's trying to say, if an adult has sex with a child, but the leftist sees themselves as a child, it's not pedophilia.
[01:36:06.715 --> 01:36:09.055]  That's where they're going with all this.
[01:36:09.055 --> 01:36:10.355]  Mind control.
[01:36:10.355 --> 01:36:19.397]  And then when they create, which they've created, the humanoids that are part animal, part human, that don't have any rights, well now they're going to endow them with their rights, they're claiming, but they own them and control them.
[01:36:20.455 --> 01:36:26.301]  You better not criticize the real trans zoological creature.
[01:36:26.301 --> 01:36:30.505]  So let's do this.
[01:36:30.505 --> 01:36:34.389]  I did massive preparation for this over five days.
[01:36:34.389 --> 01:36:40.595]  And again, I try to figure out the mental reasons that once I get on air, I don't want to talk about it or get into it.
[01:36:40.595 --> 01:36:42.277]  There's like a block.
[01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:44.440]  I'm going to do it.
[01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:45.480]  I'm going to do it next hour.
[01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:47.821]  I'm going to do it at the start of the next hour.
[01:36:47.821 --> 01:36:50.081]  And I know what the memo block is, now that I say it.
[01:36:50.081 --> 01:36:52.442]  It's that I can't do it justice.
[01:36:52.442 --> 01:36:58.103]  I was already working on NATO and their plan to take over the US, and I started talking about it last week.
[01:36:58.103 --> 01:37:00.864]  And then a caller called in and said, oh, have you seen this?
[01:37:00.864 --> 01:37:05.485]  Which I hadn't seen, which is even worse than what I said.
[01:37:05.485 --> 01:37:09.826]  So I spent about 30 minutes this morning trying to read
[01:37:11.047 --> 01:37:13.468]  Scan over 100 plus pages.
[01:37:13.468 --> 01:37:18.091]  And I found so much horrible stuff that I could do five weeks of shows on this.
[01:37:18.091 --> 01:37:20.232]  So, I mean, it's like, I'm not a victim.
[01:37:20.232 --> 01:37:20.952]  I feel beat up.
[01:37:20.952 --> 01:37:23.634]  I feel like I've been punched in the stomach about 10 times.
[01:37:23.634 --> 01:37:26.935]  Because the people that run NATO are the ones kidnapping kids and running everything.
[01:37:26.935 --> 01:37:29.257]  I mean, that's the top of the pyramid right here.
[01:37:29.257 --> 01:37:30.137]  The group that runs NATO.
[01:37:30.137 --> 01:37:32.939]  That's the international globalist group.
[01:37:32.939 --> 01:37:37.281]  And this is how they're going to put chips in your brains, how they own you, how they control you.
[01:37:37.281 --> 01:37:38.401]  This is just one thing.
[01:37:40.518 --> 01:37:51.606]  Science Technology Trends 2020-2040, Exploring the CNT Edge, NATO's science technology organization.
[01:37:51.606 --> 01:37:56.270]  Now, what was I already studying five days ago before he called in about this nightmare?
[01:37:56.270 --> 01:38:01.474]  It's basically the same thing, but even worse.
[01:38:01.474 --> 01:38:03.535]  NATO's plans to hack your brain.
[01:38:03.535 --> 01:38:05.156]  Remember that Zero Hedge article?
[01:38:05.156 --> 01:38:08.459]  And I've got the document right here.
[01:38:08.459 --> 01:38:09.760]  I'm going to hit that next hour.
[01:38:11.380 --> 01:38:19.862]  I said I'd hit it Friday, I said I'd hit it Saturday, Sunday, never hit it, Saturday I hit it yesterday, never hit it, I'm going to hit it next hour.
[01:38:19.862 --> 01:38:23.622]  And then I'm going to hit this, because you want to know what's really going on.
[01:38:23.622 --> 01:38:28.983]  You want to know what they know and what they don't want you to know?
[01:38:28.983 --> 01:38:31.864]  It's right here in this folder.
[01:38:31.864 --> 01:38:36.965]  And if I spent 20 years on this, it wouldn't be long enough.
[01:38:36.965 --> 01:38:39.165]  The observer effect in quantum physics.
[01:38:41.704 --> 01:38:47.025]  Now this is just a tiny little sliver of power.
[01:38:47.025 --> 01:38:54.147]  This, this in my hand is the ultimate power in the universe beneath God.
[01:38:54.147 --> 01:38:56.507]  This is in fact God's will.
[01:38:56.507 --> 01:39:00.288]  And we have been given, little g, God-like powers.
[01:39:00.288 --> 01:39:02.649]  Observed by electron microscopes,
[01:39:03.948 --> 01:39:14.311]  Spectrometers, you name it, all the systems, and they already knew this theoretically, and it's been proven, and that's what they're doing, and that's how they're programming your subconscious.
[01:39:14.311 --> 01:39:17.172]  I will hit this as well.
[01:39:17.172 --> 01:39:27.195]  But I'm going to do an entire long presentation on this soon, and I've been quietly working on this for a while, and that's why I've decided you can't just do 20, 30 minutes on this.
[01:39:27.195 --> 01:39:32.717]  Very soon, and if I work hard, and we're on schedule right now, by the mid-December,
[01:39:34.292 --> 01:39:45.577]  There will be a film, an entire production, on the observer effect in quantum physics.
[01:39:45.577 --> 01:39:48.798]  And I've not talked about this because it's so big and so important.
[01:39:48.798 --> 01:39:49.679]  I mean, I've talked about it a lot.
[01:39:49.679 --> 01:39:51.279]  I've mentioned it and given you the basics.
[01:39:51.279 --> 01:39:52.520]  I know most of you already know about it.
[01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:56.562]  But I mean, what does it really mean?
[01:39:56.562 --> 01:40:03.105]  This is why there isn't one person that is a controller that believes that there isn't God or isn't demand.
[01:40:03.105 --> 01:40:03.705]  They all know.
[01:40:05.745 --> 01:40:08.786]  The God Particle.
[01:40:08.786 --> 01:40:16.850]  Theoretically, you know, cooked up by Max Planck and then the guy that was certainly smart, but took a lot of it and then just popularized it.
[01:40:16.850 --> 01:40:21.712]  That's Albert Einstein, but Max Planck's the super genius.
[01:40:21.712 --> 01:40:22.973]  Einstein's the genius.
[01:40:22.973 --> 01:40:24.213]  Nobody's saying he's not a genius.
[01:40:24.213 --> 01:40:26.674]  Hey, I was freaking smart.
[01:40:26.674 --> 01:40:30.056]  I mean, autistic mathematician, but Max Planck was the Big Daddy.
[01:40:31.049 --> 01:40:32.810]  We're going to be talking about that.
[01:40:32.810 --> 01:40:42.395]  And I remember being three years old, five years old, 10 years old, being sent for a week during the summers to stay with my grandparents.
[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:54.942]  And getting in trouble, sneaking out in the middle of the night to go to the park across the street.
[01:40:54.942 --> 01:40:57.903]  My grandmother screaming at me, but they were really sweet, but little stuff like that.
[01:40:57.903 --> 01:41:03.967]  And I remember my grandfather yelling at me in a nice way about quantum mechanics and Max Planck.
[01:41:03.967 --> 01:41:18.555]  And I didn't know that he was all into that and went and saw, you know, really select seminars and things that not everybody got into with these physicists that came after Planck and Werner Von Braun and all of it.
[01:41:18.555 --> 01:41:19.275]  He was a pretty smart guy.
[01:41:21.462 --> 01:41:24.805]  But it's funny, all the stuff he was telling me back then, it just comes to mind.
[01:41:24.805 --> 01:41:29.028]  And we've been living all of this and not understanding it.
[01:41:29.028 --> 01:41:38.855]  So this is basically like discovering the keys to the car that's all juiced up and loaded up with fuel and ready to drive down the road.
[01:41:38.855 --> 01:41:45.941]  And it's like a baby finally having the consciousness moment where the baby realizes, I am conscious, I am a consciousness.
[01:41:47.995 --> 01:41:52.136]  And how much power you've got.
[01:41:52.136 --> 01:41:58.178]  So that's coming up today.
[01:41:58.178 --> 01:41:59.599]  And I'm going to get more into it.
[01:41:59.599 --> 01:42:02.380]  And I've already been doing a lot of work on it and a lot of research.
[01:42:02.380 --> 01:42:06.301]  And we're shooting and editing and putting all this together right now.
[01:42:06.301 --> 01:42:12.183]  And that's just one, as I told you, eight big projects that we got going on simultaneously.
[01:42:14.619 --> 01:42:19.382]  That's why I'm working 18 hours a day with extreme enjoyment.
[01:42:19.382 --> 01:42:23.544]  Because I'm plugged directly into the Zeitgeist, and so are you.
[01:42:23.544 --> 01:42:26.085]  But you have to first realize that.
[01:42:26.085 --> 01:42:31.428]  And once you do, well, primary ignition has begun.
[01:42:31.428 --> 01:42:32.469]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:32.469 --> 01:42:36.471]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[01:42:36.471 --> 01:42:39.173]  Next Millennium's News Today.
[01:42:43.274 --> 01:42:47.679]  By now you've heard me talk about the BioProbes and how they're creating amazing products.
[01:42:47.679 --> 01:42:56.609]  They've done it again and have just released an entire suite of bioremediation products, bringing industrial-level technology to the everyday consumer.
[01:42:56.609 --> 01:43:00.514]  They're literally changing the industry with a revolutionary patented delivery system.
[01:43:00.794 --> 01:43:09.622]  The BioPros are excited to release BioDrain Pro, a product specifically designed to establish healthy drains, pipes, and overall plumbing systems.
[01:43:09.622 --> 01:43:15.587]  BioDrain Pro digests grease, fats, oil, sludge, paper, and organic matter with ease.
[01:43:16.147 --> 01:43:23.249]  It contains no chemicals, no GMOs, and is safe for black, gray holding tanks, sewer hoses, and plumbing.
[01:43:23.249 --> 01:43:25.370]  It is also human and animal safe.
[01:43:25.370 --> 01:43:29.631]  Get up to 20 treatments with the scoop for easy applications.
[01:43:29.631 --> 01:43:33.612]  Say goodbye to drain problems, gas buildup, and odor.
[01:43:33.612 --> 01:43:34.953]  Guaranteed.
[01:43:34.953 --> 01:43:36.353]  Just pour and add water.
[01:43:36.353 --> 01:43:37.213]  It's that simple.
[01:43:37.213 --> 01:43:39.714]  Visit thebiopros.com and see for yourself.
[01:43:42.492 --> 01:43:48.597]  One of the most studied and researched areas of human health and physiology is inflammation.
[01:43:48.597 --> 01:43:49.938]  It's associated with cancer.
[01:43:49.938 --> 01:43:51.659]  It's associated with joint problems.
[01:43:51.659 --> 01:43:54.761]  It's associated with viral infections, bacterial infections.
[01:43:54.761 --> 01:43:56.443]  It's associated with death.
[01:43:56.443 --> 01:44:04.869]  And out of all the incredible compounds that God gave us through nature that fights inflammation and makes our lives better, turmeric is chief amongst them all.
[01:44:04.869 --> 01:44:10.133]  And chief amongst all the turmeric products out there is body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[01:44:10.498 --> 01:44:11.599]  My wife loves turmeric.
[01:44:11.599 --> 01:44:16.565]  She has joint pain, but she has to take a lot of it, the type of stuff she buys at the grocery store, for it to work.
[01:44:16.565 --> 01:44:19.588]  She started taking this and said, I only need to take one pill instead of four.
[01:44:19.588 --> 01:44:20.789]  Why is it so good?
[01:44:20.789 --> 01:44:22.111]  It's not just turmeric.
[01:44:22.111 --> 01:44:25.194]  It's concentrated with a proprietary process.
[01:44:25.194 --> 01:44:26.075]  It's back in stock.
[01:44:26.075 --> 01:44:28.238]  They're being sold out almost five months.
[01:44:28.598 --> 01:44:28.979]  Thank you.
[01:44:43.971 --> 01:44:46.833]  It's time to protect your privacy.
[01:44:46.833 --> 01:45:00.822]  It's time to come to grips with the fact that even though you don't have anything to hide, criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech, government are stealing all of your data and creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do.
[01:45:00.822 --> 01:45:05.265]  So in the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down.
[01:45:05.265 --> 01:45:13.631]  Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts, protecting your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount.
[01:45:14.131 --> 01:45:16.854]  That's why everybody should visit InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:45:16.854 --> 01:45:25.562]  We're carrying a huge new line of very compliant, made-in-America products that have 100% reviews and are simply incredible.
[01:45:25.562 --> 01:45:26.563]  It's a 360 win.

[01:45:37.313 --> 01:45:38.414]  Check out the new line.
[01:45:38.414 --> 01:45:38.955]  It's amazing.
[01:45:44.485 --> 01:46:06.700]  The technocrats, the social engineers, the behavioral psychologists, they're all part of the same satanic, globalist, control freak system that seeks to play God, that seeks to turn the general population of this Earth into their slaves, into putty, into clay in their hands that they control.
[01:46:06.700 --> 01:46:13.905]  And chief amongst their physical attacks is keeping us from high quality vitamins and minerals that are essential for life on this planet.
[01:46:14.645 --> 01:46:20.948]  And so, the information we cover exposes their evil works and sabotages their globalist takeover.
[01:46:20.948 --> 01:46:24.689]  And we're having an incredible effect thanks to your support and your word of mouth.
[01:46:24.689 --> 01:46:31.172]  But it's also important to take care of our bodies themselves with high-quality water filtration at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:46:31.172 --> 01:46:41.036]  And with amazing supplements, many of which that just came back into stock, like Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, now 40% off for a limited time at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:46:41.036 --> 01:46:43.417]  So let's fight the info war, but also take care of our bodies.
[01:46:47.563 --> 01:47:04.170]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:04.170 --> 01:47:07.351]  It's Tuesday, October 19th, 2021.
[01:47:18.831 --> 01:47:24.935]  The Loveless want you dead because they're selfish and they don't want you having the keys of destiny.
[01:47:24.935 --> 01:47:30.178]  Do you have the keys of destiny?
[01:47:30.178 --> 01:47:33.140]  And you will use them or you will be enslaved.
[01:47:35.373 --> 01:47:50.025]  And the enemies of humanity are Unified, the Left, the radical Islamists, the Pope that's hijacked and controls the Catholic Church, Hollywood, the Democratic Party, all of these different organizations, Big Tech.
[01:47:50.025 --> 01:47:55.349]  They all represent the same evil force that wants to kill free will.
[01:47:55.349 --> 01:47:58.192]  And now this just broke at InfoWars.com.
[01:48:00.868 --> 01:48:10.896]  Directly, officially announced by the Pope, ex-cathedra from his black throne.
[01:48:10.896 --> 01:48:16.541]  Pope demands Silicon Valley in the name of God!
[01:48:16.541 --> 01:48:18.002]  That's a quote.
[01:48:18.002 --> 01:48:24.147]  Censor, quote, hate speech and conspiracy theories, close quote.
[01:48:25.148 --> 01:48:26.509]  Yeah, who's writing his script?
[01:48:26.509 --> 01:48:30.473]  Same folks writing the ADL script, Southern Primary Law script, the UN script.
[01:48:30.473 --> 01:48:33.176]  It's all one mouth.
[01:48:33.176 --> 01:48:37.180]  Vomiting it out and they all pick it back up and gobble it up and then vomit it back on us.
[01:48:37.180 --> 01:48:39.162]  But he's one of the biggest mouths out there.
[01:48:40.424 --> 01:48:49.089]  He said questioning authority and questioning the EU and the globalists, remember two years ago, was like those fascinated with eating human feces.
[01:48:49.089 --> 01:48:50.110]  I never even thought of that.
[01:48:50.110 --> 01:48:54.613]  I looked up the word he said, and he kind of tells us what he's into, right?
[01:48:54.613 --> 01:48:56.754]  Pope, I mean, I'm serious, he does do that.
[01:48:56.754 --> 01:49:01.377]  You know that to defile his body and cut himself off from God, believe me, that's the bare minimum this guy does.
[01:49:01.377 --> 01:49:03.839]  He oversees pure Satanism.
[01:49:03.839 --> 01:49:08.962]  So, Pope demands Silicon Valley, in the name of God, censor hate speech
[01:49:09.502 --> 01:49:10.843]  Conspiracy theories.
[01:49:10.843 --> 01:49:15.828]  So he is the Antichrist general now occupying the Vatican.
[01:49:15.828 --> 01:49:22.735]  Pope Francis invoked God in an effort to pressure Silicon Valley giants into censoring more content.
[01:49:23.763 --> 01:49:24.964]  They're so desperate.
[01:49:24.964 --> 01:49:27.467]  Including hate speech and conspiracy theories.
[01:49:27.467 --> 01:49:28.668]  Yes, really!
[01:49:28.668 --> 01:49:33.553]  The Pope made the remarks during a worldwide meeting of popular movements.
[01:49:33.553 --> 01:49:34.614]  Ah!
[01:49:34.614 --> 01:49:36.576]  Not too much promoting Christianity there.
[01:49:36.576 --> 01:49:40.600]  A shadowy organization created to promote social justice.
[01:49:40.600 --> 01:49:42.142]  Oh, George Soros.
[01:49:42.142 --> 01:49:43.463]  And fight racism.
[01:49:44.304 --> 01:49:48.266]  With the help of religious leaders, he said, I don't want to hear about Europe's Christian roots.
[01:49:48.266 --> 01:49:49.967]  That makes me nauseous.
[01:49:49.967 --> 01:49:52.188]  Yes, it isn't like a big steaming bowl of poop.
[01:49:52.188 --> 01:49:55.730]  It's not delicious like the things you like.
[01:49:55.730 --> 01:49:58.152]  Jesus is horrible to you, isn't it?
[01:49:58.152 --> 01:49:59.792]  I can't even say his name.
[01:49:59.792 --> 01:50:02.094]  I wonder if there's any video of this guy even saying the word Jesus.
[01:50:02.094 --> 01:50:02.814]  I don't think he probably can.
[01:50:02.814 --> 01:50:05.015]  He'd probably burst in a flame if he did.
[01:50:05.015 --> 01:50:07.537]  In the name of God, he said, not Jesus,
[01:50:08.297 --> 01:50:10.098]  Let's say this, in the name of Jesus, you say that?
[01:50:10.098 --> 01:50:10.538]  No.
[01:50:10.538 --> 01:50:12.940]  In the name of God, what God is that?
[01:50:12.940 --> 01:50:22.906]  In the name of God, I asked the technology giants to stop exploiting human weakness, which again, this is all true, they're doing it, but he's going along with their agenda.
[01:50:22.906 --> 01:50:25.708]  See, it's like that whistleblower that calls for more censorship.
[01:50:25.708 --> 01:50:26.729]  She's not a whistleblower.
[01:50:26.729 --> 01:50:28.810]  They want to pose as if they're anti-establishment.
[01:50:28.810 --> 01:50:30.351]  It's like, please don't throw me in the briar patch.
[01:50:31.624 --> 01:50:42.274]  In the name of God, I ask the technology giants to stop exploiting human weakness, people's vulnerability for the sake of profits without caring about the spread of hate speech, the grooming, oh, the grooming!
[01:50:42.274 --> 01:50:45.617]  Wow, that's the fox telling us about the hen house.
[01:50:45.617 --> 01:50:49.941]  Fake news, conspiracy theories, and political manipulation, he stated.
[01:50:49.941 --> 01:50:52.764]  Pope Francis also invoked the term post-truth.
[01:50:52.764 --> 01:50:53.585]  This is all just
[01:50:54.085 --> 01:51:12.989]  New York Times stuff, which was invented by establishment media organs after they began to lose their monopoly of controlling the narrative following the election of their dear leader, apparently believes that Christian and godly to empower giant corporations to shut down free speech.
[01:51:12.989 --> 01:51:15.490]  And again, the computer printed this twice, I can't read it.
[01:51:15.490 --> 01:51:16.910]  The election of Joe Biden as leader.
[01:51:18.476 --> 01:51:33.039]  There is no surprise given his previous stance on free speech in response to the slaughter of Charlie Hebdo cartoonists when he rhetorically sided with the terrorists who murdered them in cold blood.
[01:51:33.039 --> 01:51:43.061]  As we documented in the video below, which Pope Francis would surely love to see banned, the Supreme Pontiff smears his critics as performing the work of the devil!
[01:51:44.778 --> 01:51:51.961]  In reality, his every action and position have served to further the Antichrist globalist beast system for which he is a willing puppet.
[01:51:51.961 --> 01:51:54.002]  Ooh, Paul Watson!
[01:51:54.002 --> 01:51:56.143]  Now Paul starts to figure it out.
[01:51:56.143 --> 01:52:04.628]  No doubt the Pope would respond to such claims by characterizing them as conspiracy theories and hate speech.
[01:52:04.628 --> 01:52:08.950]  And beginning to see how the world works, then Paul's got a bunch of videos there for you to see.
[01:52:08.950 --> 01:52:09.230]  Wow!
[01:52:11.014 --> 01:52:14.755]  And I mean, I can't even get to all the news I've got here because this stuff keeps breaking.
[01:52:14.755 --> 01:52:18.955]  And we've got a new first woman four-star admiral that's a dude.
[01:52:18.955 --> 01:52:20.216]  It's a freak show, folks.
[01:52:20.216 --> 01:52:23.416]  It's designed to get you off balance where you just put up with anything.
[01:52:23.416 --> 01:52:26.777]  How are they going to get us to put up with martial law and all this?
[01:52:26.777 --> 01:52:28.877]  Or Satanism openly being practiced in the schools.
[01:52:28.877 --> 01:52:33.518]  Put up big satanic monuments in front of the churches, in front of the government buildings.
[01:52:33.518 --> 01:52:34.218]  All of this.
[01:52:34.218 --> 01:52:37.379]  You're already under martial law with the lockdowns.
[01:52:37.379 --> 01:52:38.599]  You're already in it.
[01:52:40.100 --> 01:52:46.403]  And then, Dr. Bartlett, who's an amazing person, he works like 20 hours a day trying to save people.
[01:52:46.403 --> 01:52:47.343]  Saved my dad, no doubt.
[01:52:47.343 --> 01:52:48.264]  He's just sending me messages.
[01:52:48.264 --> 01:52:51.585]  Look, here's CBS News locally confirming they put bags over people's heads.
[01:52:51.585 --> 01:52:54.527]  Here's another place, another state, where the whole body's got a bag on it.
[01:52:54.527 --> 01:52:56.208]  This is gonna kill people.
[01:52:56.208 --> 01:52:58.088]  Next, they'll be taping it around their heads.
[01:52:58.088 --> 01:52:59.669]  And then this morning, it broke.
[01:52:59.669 --> 01:53:04.832]  They're now taping the bags around the head and actually killing people.
[01:53:04.832 --> 01:53:05.372]  Hypoxia.
[01:53:06.963 --> 01:53:09.745]  You see in a movie where they put the bag over their head and kill somebody, that's real.
[01:53:09.745 --> 01:53:11.587]  Well, now that's medical care.
[01:53:11.587 --> 01:53:13.148]  You're like, that's not medical care.
[01:53:13.148 --> 01:53:14.469]  Yes it is.
[01:53:14.469 --> 01:53:16.911]  In fact, the left says it's good for babies to be aborted.
[01:53:16.911 --> 01:53:18.412]  They'd have horrible lives.
[01:53:18.412 --> 01:53:19.193]  See, same thing.
[01:53:19.193 --> 01:53:27.200]  Teachers at Colorado Springs force children to take masks to their faces over the top because they don't want any of the other air getting in.
[01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:35.747]  Just like new videos have come out on CBS News, and we can put that screenshot up, I sent it to you, where they've got bags all the way down the body.
[01:53:36.977 --> 01:53:38.118]  And it's now confirmed.
[01:53:38.118 --> 01:53:41.240]  People when we first reported that last week thought it was made up.
[01:53:41.240 --> 01:53:44.302]  No.
[01:53:44.302 --> 01:53:48.805]  There's audio in the article because the students, you know, and their cameras at the floor of it happening.
[01:53:48.805 --> 01:53:55.570]  Let me just stop right here for just a moment and say this because I didn't plug last hour and I need to or we won't be here.
[01:53:55.570 --> 01:53:57.271]  I'm just going to keep fighting as long as we can stay on air.
[01:53:57.271 --> 01:54:00.653]  We're not going to be able to stay on air unless you financially support us.
[01:54:00.653 --> 01:54:03.095]  And you've been doing that except now with the supply chain breakdowns.
[01:54:04.181 --> 01:54:04.521]  I don't know.
[01:54:28.442 --> 01:54:34.507]  We've been sold out all these products that normally we sell enough of to stay on air and actually expand in the face of the globalists.
[01:54:34.507 --> 01:54:36.769]  I want to expand during this critical time.
[01:54:36.769 --> 01:54:37.909]  But it hasn't happened.
[01:54:37.909 --> 01:54:42.533]  And so sometimes we're out of products for almost a year or six or eight months.
[01:54:42.533 --> 01:54:44.355]  DNA Force finally came back in.
[01:54:44.355 --> 01:54:45.355]  We've got it back in stock.
[01:54:45.355 --> 01:54:46.376]  It's amazing.
[01:54:46.376 --> 01:54:49.879]  And now we have Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula back in stock.
[01:54:49.879 --> 01:54:55.343]  We got a good shipment of it, but it's still going to sell out in a month or so, and it'll be probably four or five, six months before we get more.
[01:54:55.343 --> 01:54:55.964]  It is 95% curcuminoid.
[01:54:57.751 --> 01:55:00.492]  And it's 40% off for one week only.
[01:55:00.492 --> 01:55:07.675]  Inflammation is such an issue with people out there, and turmeric is known to be, of all the things God gave us through nature, the most powerful.
[01:55:07.675 --> 01:55:14.458]  Well, this is concentrated 95% curcuminoid from a leading brand that we did not private label.
[01:55:14.458 --> 01:55:18.159]  They were telling us they were 40-something percent curcuminoid.
[01:55:18.159 --> 01:55:23.201]  In their patented process, which we checked, you know, and had tested, it's true, they said, but we could go as high as 94, 95%.
[01:55:25.305 --> 01:55:26.715]  But it costs this much more.
[01:55:26.715 --> 01:55:27.762]  We did it!
[01:55:27.762 --> 01:55:28.165]  They did it!
[01:55:29.045 --> 01:55:31.426]  Ninety-five percent curcuminoid.
[01:55:31.426 --> 01:55:33.067]  Ninety-five percent curcuminoid.
[01:55:33.067 --> 01:55:42.113]  And again, my wife plays a lot of tennis, a lot of sports, and she's very competitive, one of the highest rated in Austin, and her hip hurts from it.
[01:55:42.113 --> 01:55:45.595]  And she takes these big horse pill, Temerix, and a couple years ago when this came out, I said, take this.
[01:55:45.595 --> 01:55:47.056]  Started taking like five big pills.
[01:55:47.056 --> 01:55:54.160]  She goes, it takes this much, but it works better than Advil and stuff, and Tylenol, and she even took painkillers sometimes that hurt so bad.
[01:55:54.160 --> 01:55:54.841]  Almost had surgery.
[01:55:55.581 --> 01:56:02.247]  And she took this, she said, my God, I just took one or two pills, it worked as good as five or six big ones, but it shows a lower milligram, and I said, it's concentrated.
[01:56:02.247 --> 01:56:05.690]  It's according to the rules, you just call it turmeric, but it's a concentrate.
[01:56:05.690 --> 01:56:09.373]  So this is what she takes religiously, and 99% less complaining.
[01:56:09.373 --> 01:56:11.354]  It worked, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:56:11.354 --> 01:56:16.699]  That's the power of what God gave us, and then humans are able to concentrate it and make it even stronger.
[01:56:16.699 --> 01:56:23.545]  So, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, back in stock at Infowarstore.com, or call toll free,
[01:56:24.821 --> 01:56:24.861]  888-253-3139
[01:56:34.844 --> 01:56:37.746]  Or you can simply, again, go to Infowarsstore.com.
[01:56:37.746 --> 01:56:40.307]  And we have down and out is still 50% off.
[01:56:40.307 --> 01:56:44.390]  We had to end the sale on Ultra 12 and Winter Sun because it's getting close to selling out.
[01:56:44.390 --> 01:56:45.750]  More coming in in a few months.
[01:56:45.750 --> 01:56:46.571]  But we still have it.
[01:56:46.571 --> 01:56:49.312]  It's still discounted 25%, just not 50.
[01:56:49.312 --> 01:56:54.896]  But I'm extending the NA Force a few more days at 40% off that extends your telomeres.
[01:56:54.896 --> 01:56:57.357]  It doesn't grow them, but makes them last longer, which is the same thing.
[01:56:59.178 --> 01:57:04.105]  This is observable, it's documented, it's proven, and it's got the PQQ, the CoQ10, and so much more.
[01:57:04.105 --> 01:57:09.311]  That is the Rolls-Royce for your cells, for your mitochondria, for everything else, for your immune system.
[01:57:09.311 --> 01:57:10.573]  DNA Force Plus.
[01:57:10.573 --> 01:57:12.496]  The Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[01:57:12.496 --> 01:57:13.116]  40% off.
[01:57:13.116 --> 01:57:14.138]  Limited time.
[01:57:14.138 --> 01:57:16.180]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:57:17.614 --> 01:57:18.794]  And we just got it back in again.
[01:57:18.794 --> 01:57:19.935]  It was only sold out for a month.
[01:57:19.935 --> 01:57:24.856]  We have charcoal toothpaste with activated charcoal concentrated in mouthwash.
[01:57:24.856 --> 01:57:26.376]  Designed by my dad, a dentist.
[01:57:26.376 --> 01:57:26.956]  It's amazing.
[01:57:26.956 --> 01:57:29.417]  No fillers at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:57:29.417 --> 01:57:34.278]  Get that as well.
[01:57:34.278 --> 01:57:35.519]  I'm sitting here.
[01:57:35.519 --> 01:57:40.120]  It's in the early morning hours and I'm looking at mainstream news.
[01:57:41.644 --> 01:57:56.373]  ...reporting on the fact that even the controlled revolving door FDA has come out and said that the Moderna and Pfizer shots need to be held up and not authorized for children because in studies they did on children it caused myocarditis, that's heart swelling and heart attacks.
[01:57:57.662 --> 01:58:06.747]  And then I noticed that even though this is even in the Associated Press, it's not getting any circulation, it's not on the national news, and it's very hard to even find on places like Instagram or Twitter.
[01:58:06.747 --> 01:58:07.707]  It's just crazy.
[01:58:07.707 --> 01:58:16.691]  And then, Fauci was on TV just yesterday, saying there's no damage from the vaccines, it doesn't hurt anybody, you're a conspiracy theorist if you say it.
[01:58:16.691 --> 01:58:18.172]  It's just crazy.
[01:58:18.172 --> 01:58:25.276]  And then we have all the scientists who over a year ago came out and said, these vaccines are gonna cause heart problems, and they gave the exact reasons why, and now it happened.
[01:58:26.097 --> 01:58:28.023]  That's why Infowars is on air.
[01:58:28.023 --> 01:58:31.112]  Because if we weren't on air, they'd get away with even more of this crap.
[01:58:31.112 --> 01:58:32.135]  This is just insane.
[01:58:32.135 --> 01:58:32.938]  These people are killers.
[01:58:37.040 --> 01:58:46.652]  Because of the globalist reset, InfoWars listeners and viewers know a lot of our best-selling products have been sold out in some cases for up to a year.
[01:58:46.652 --> 01:58:53.500]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula with 95% Curcuminoid has been sold out for almost five months.
[01:58:53.500 --> 01:58:56.404]  Because again, the high-quality turmeric and the concentration process
[01:58:56.844 --> 01:58:57.045]  I think so.
[01:59:17.247 --> 01:59:18.768]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:59:47.583 --> 01:59:53.006]  If I was the devil, I would call good evil and evil good.
[01:59:53.006 --> 01:59:55.067]  I would silence the families.
[01:59:55.067 --> 01:59:57.408]  I would attack our children.
[01:59:57.408 --> 02:00:02.491]  I would say that men are women.
[02:00:02.491 --> 02:00:06.773]  I would promote abortion and infanticide and war and big pharma and poison shots.
[02:00:06.773 --> 02:00:09.215]  I would kill, steal and destroy.
[02:00:09.215 --> 02:00:11.356]  If I were the devil, remember Paul Harvey?
[02:00:18.196 --> 02:00:20.259]  I... were the devil.
[02:00:20.259 --> 02:00:24.426]  If I were the Prince of Darkness, I'd want to engulf the whole world in darkness.
[02:00:24.426 --> 02:00:30.856]  And I'd have a third of its real estate and four-fifths of its population, but I wouldn't be happy until I had seized the ripest apple on the tree.
[02:00:33.908 --> 02:00:37.109]  So I set about however necessary to take over the United States.
[02:00:37.109 --> 02:00:40.910]  President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shooting.
[02:00:40.910 --> 02:00:42.311]  I'd subvert the churches first.
[02:00:42.311 --> 02:00:44.431]  I'd begin with a campaign of whispers.
[02:00:44.431 --> 02:00:48.092]  With the wisdom of a serpent I would whisper to you as I whispered to Eve.
[02:00:48.092 --> 02:00:49.292]  Do as you please.
[02:00:49.292 --> 02:00:51.373]  To the young I would whisper that the Bible is a myth.
[02:00:51.833 --> 02:00:55.719]  I would convince them that man created God instead of the other way around.
[02:00:55.719 --> 02:00:59.804]  I would confide that what's bad is good and what's good is square.
[02:00:59.804 --> 02:01:02.909]  And the old I would teach to pray after me.
[02:01:02.909 --> 02:01:05.192]  Our Father, which art in Washington.
[02:01:06.158 --> 02:01:07.379]  And then I'd get organized.
[02:01:07.379 --> 02:01:13.422]  I'd educate authors in how to make lurid literature exciting so that anything else would appear dull and uninteresting.
[02:01:13.422 --> 02:01:16.845]  I'd threaten TV with dirtier movies and vice versa.
[02:01:16.845 --> 02:01:18.606]  I'd peddle narcotics to whom I could.
[02:01:18.606 --> 02:01:21.908]  I'd sell alcohol to ladies and gentlemen of distinction.
[02:01:21.908 --> 02:01:23.749]  I'd tranquilize the rest with pills.
[02:01:25.409 --> 02:01:36.152]  If I were the devil, I'd soon have families at war with themselves, churches at war with themselves, and nations at war with themselves, until each in its turn was consumed.
[02:01:36.152 --> 02:01:41.774]  And with promises of higher ratings, I'd have mesmerizing media fanning the flames.
[02:01:41.774 --> 02:01:44.714]  The President of the United States is racist.
[02:01:44.714 --> 02:01:51.336]  If I were the devil, I would encourage schools to refine young intellects, but neglect the disciplined emotions children of those run wild.
[02:01:51.636 --> 02:01:54.577]  Within a decade, I'd have prisons overflowing.
[02:01:54.577 --> 02:01:56.957]  I'd have judges promoting pornography.
[02:01:56.957 --> 02:02:02.719]  Soon I could evict God from the courthouse, then from the schoolhouse, and then from the houses of Congress.
[02:02:02.719 --> 02:02:07.820]  And in his own churches, I would substitute psychology for religion.
[02:02:07.820 --> 02:02:13.061]  I would lure priests and pastors into misusing boys and girls and church money.
[02:02:13.061 --> 02:02:20.363]  If I were the devil, I'd take from those who have and give to those who wanted, until I had killed the incentive of the ambitious.
[02:02:22.072 --> 02:02:23.893]  I would caution against extremes.
[02:02:23.893 --> 02:02:24.893]  I'm here to warn people!
[02:02:24.893 --> 02:02:26.453]  You keep telling me to shut up!
[02:02:26.453 --> 02:02:27.554]  This isn't a game!
[02:02:27.554 --> 02:02:39.097]  In hard work, in patriotism, in moral conduct, I would convince the young that marriage is old-fashioned, that swinging is more fun, that what you see on TV is the way to be.
[02:02:39.097 --> 02:02:47.580]  And thus I could undress you in public, and I could lure you into bed with diseases for which there is no cure.
[02:02:47.580 --> 02:02:50.701]  In other words, if I were the devil, I'd just keep right on doing what he's doing.
[02:03:04.249 --> 02:03:08.251]  Now, a clip from Media Matters terrified that Tucker Carlson defends free speech.
[02:03:08.251 --> 02:03:10.093]  Here's part of that report.
[02:03:10.093 --> 02:03:12.534]  Why do we laugh at Alex Jones against sincere questions?
[02:03:12.534 --> 02:03:14.475]  Tucker's understood this for three, four years.
[02:03:14.475 --> 02:03:17.437]  I've been friends with Tucker for about eight, nine.
[02:03:17.437 --> 02:03:18.798]  I mean, you know, as well as I.
[02:03:19.617 --> 02:03:23.160]  There's nobody in the press who is culturally on the same page as you are, or I am for that matter.
[02:03:23.160 --> 02:03:23.400]  Alex Jones.
[02:03:23.400 --> 02:03:23.621]  Alex Jones.
[02:03:23.621 --> 02:03:23.841]  Alex Jones.
[02:03:23.841 --> 02:03:24.601]  Tucker Carlson.
[02:03:24.601 --> 02:03:24.862]  Alex Jones.
[02:03:24.862 --> 02:03:25.162]  Alex Jones.
[02:03:25.162 --> 02:03:25.402]  Alex Jones.
[02:03:25.402 --> 02:03:25.782]  Alex Jones.
[02:03:25.782 --> 02:03:26.023]  Alex Jones.
[02:03:26.023 --> 02:03:26.243]  Alex Jones.
[02:03:26.243 --> 02:03:26.503]  Alex Jones.
[02:03:26.503 --> 02:03:26.763]  Alex Jones.
[02:03:26.763 --> 02:03:27.004]  Alex Jones.
[02:03:27.004 --> 02:03:27.684]  Alex Jones.

[02:03:43.638 --> 02:03:44.078]  Alex Jones.
[02:03:44.078 --> 02:03:44.378]  Alex Jones.
[02:03:44.378 --> 02:03:44.799]  Alex Jones.
[02:03:44.799 --> 02:03:45.239]  Alex Jones.
[02:03:45.239 --> 02:03:45.519]  Alex Jones.
[02:03:45.519 --> 02:03:45.880]  Alex Jones.
[02:03:45.880 --> 02:03:46.220]  Alex
[02:03:46.639 --> 02:03:48.060]  On January 6th.
[02:03:48.060 --> 02:03:52.902]  This was a psychological warfare operation to manipulate a crowd.
[02:03:52.902 --> 02:03:53.883]  You know, that's enough.
[02:03:53.883 --> 02:03:55.123]  I'm not going to play the whole thing.
[02:03:55.123 --> 02:03:55.684]  We're out of time.
[02:03:55.684 --> 02:03:57.645]  I'm going to play it later if we have time.
[02:03:57.645 --> 02:03:59.986]  But it's admitted the FBI was running things.
[02:03:59.986 --> 02:04:01.727]  Now it's come out.
[02:04:01.727 --> 02:04:09.391]  So just the way they operate and the way they try to get Tucker in trouble at News Corp for defending me, it's not going to work.
[02:04:09.391 --> 02:04:13.473]  Tucker is the only guy there that has a contract where you say whatever he wants, just so you know.
[02:04:14.184 --> 02:04:15.785]  So they're totally panicked.
[02:04:15.785 --> 02:04:16.666]  They don't know what to do.
[02:04:16.666 --> 02:04:18.447]  All right.
[02:04:18.447 --> 02:04:24.091]  I've got the biggest news yet on the bioweapons being cooked up in labs we're going to hit.
[02:04:24.091 --> 02:04:29.315]  Then I'm going to get into the NATO information and how that's really the king daddy operation.
[02:04:29.315 --> 02:04:33.238]  And then I've got that really key thing I'm going to start beginning to talk about today.
[02:04:33.238 --> 02:04:40.864]  The observer effect and quantum physics or quantum mechanics of quantum physics.
[02:04:40.864 --> 02:04:41.885]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:45.127 --> 02:05:07.940]  I am taping this update on the morning of Tuesday, October 19th, 2021, to let all of our great radio and TV listeners know that Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula that's been sold out for a long time is back in stock with a 95% curcuminoid level that's so good for inflammation and more for 40% off for a limited time that it goes back to regular price in one week.

[02:05:27.648 --> 02:05:28.049]  Oh my god.
[02:05:28.049 --> 02:05:29.189]  You think fish oil is good?
[02:05:29.189 --> 02:05:30.009]  This is amazing.
[02:05:30.009 --> 02:05:30.809]  Real oil.
[02:05:30.809 --> 02:05:32.090]  DNA Force Plus.
[02:05:32.090 --> 02:05:34.031]  I've extended that for a few more days.
[02:05:34.031 --> 02:05:36.151]  40% off back in stock.
[02:05:36.151 --> 02:05:36.891]  Amazing.
[02:05:36.891 --> 02:05:38.452]  Down and out.
[02:05:38.452 --> 02:05:39.192]  50% off.
[02:05:39.192 --> 02:05:42.213]  It's got eight different natural compounds for deeper, cleaner sleep.
[02:05:42.213 --> 02:05:44.174]  It's all available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:05:50.020 --> 02:05:54.024]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:05:54.024 --> 02:06:04.194]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:04.194 --> 02:06:08.739]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we've covered a lot of global news.
[02:06:08.739 --> 02:06:10.340]  We've covered the transgender
[02:06:11.311 --> 02:06:26.037]  Depopulation, Western-style one-child policy program, where we just sterilize our young boys and condition them and brainwash them to accept transgenderism, which is, again, just chemical or physical mutilation and sterilization.
[02:06:26.037 --> 02:06:28.058]  That, we covered a lot.
[02:06:28.058 --> 02:06:29.399]  We covered a lot of other big subjects.
[02:06:29.399 --> 02:06:31.660]  But right now, I'm going to hit the big one.
[02:06:33.001 --> 02:06:45.808]  That yes, I've been harping on for 20 months, every day on this show, because it is the Great Reset, it is the Takeover, it is their New World Order plan, in Klaus Schwab, in Bill Gates' own words.
[02:06:45.808 --> 02:06:49.450]  So, I'm gonna hit this right now.
[02:06:49.450 --> 02:06:51.271]  Huge stack here.
[02:06:51.271 --> 02:06:57.195]  And it all ties together, and I hope you take notes, and I hope you listen to me very, very carefully, because this is a life and death situation.
[02:06:59.687 --> 02:07:02.989]  We know that Fauci works for the depopulationist eugenicists.
[02:07:02.989 --> 02:07:16.639]  We know they cooked up COVID-19 as a bioweapon out of five viruses that they would own, that they could control, so they could then release more deadly variants whenever they wanted, claiming that they were just variants of COVID-19.
[02:07:16.639 --> 02:07:21.062]  And that they produced synthetic nanotech viruses
[02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:43.750]  That would show up in a testing machine as COVID-19 and they really just wanted the COVID-19 cover story to be able to release nanotech viruses that have a half-life that only replicates so long so the globalists can bomb certain areas or certain places like the chemical or biological version of a neutron bomb.
[02:07:45.745 --> 02:07:47.526]  And if you don't know what that is, look it up and you'll understand.
[02:07:47.526 --> 02:07:52.250]  A neutron bomb kills all the life that leaves the infrastructure in place and doesn't destroy the buildings.
[02:07:52.250 --> 02:07:56.293]  And the radiation is gone in just a few minutes.
[02:07:56.293 --> 02:07:59.396]  And then you can just come in and replant and regrow.
[02:07:59.396 --> 02:08:01.077]  And most of the nuclear weapons are neutron.
[02:08:01.077 --> 02:08:03.219]  That's the whole Globalist plan.
[02:08:03.219 --> 02:08:07.542]  One plan is to neutron bomb the surface of the main cities and depopulate us that way.
[02:08:07.542 --> 02:08:09.244]  And they may just neutron us at any point.
[02:08:09.244 --> 02:08:12.506]  I mean, I know in the 80s they put neutron bombs up in orbit.
[02:08:13.427 --> 02:08:17.349]  I mean, just remember that.
[02:08:17.349 --> 02:08:22.833]  And once they get their people in full control of the Pentagon, which they've almost got, they may just go ahead and neutron all of us.
[02:08:22.833 --> 02:08:23.713]  But God's in control.
[02:08:23.713 --> 02:08:24.974]  We'll see if God can stop that.
[02:08:24.974 --> 02:08:26.235]  That's just a side issue.
[02:08:26.235 --> 02:08:28.476]  I didn't mean to get off into neutron bombs for you.
[02:08:28.476 --> 02:08:40.604]  This is the equivalent of a neutron biological weapon, where it's synthetic and it has a half-life and it infects normally only one or two people after that.
[02:08:40.604 --> 02:08:41.465]  And I was told that
[02:08:42.765 --> 02:08:44.793]  By a lot of people actually in U.S.
[02:08:44.793 --> 02:08:46.701]  intelligence from the highest levels last year.
[02:08:46.701 --> 02:08:48.368]  They said, no, they're going to release synthetics.
[02:08:49.864 --> 02:08:56.906]  And it can only infect a few people after, and then it basically is designed in its replication to phase out.
[02:08:56.906 --> 02:09:04.269]  And then I haven't seen it yet, but I've talked to friends and others that have seen the new James Bond movie that they held up for a year because it was, quote, too close to the real pandemic.
[02:09:04.269 --> 02:09:10.711]  And in that, there's a bioweapon that's race-specific that only kills who it targets.
[02:09:10.711 --> 02:09:17.733]  Unless you're one or two people down in the chain, while you're infected dying, it can slough off and kill you as well.
[02:09:18.703 --> 02:09:20.284]  Which is actually what it does.
[02:09:20.284 --> 02:09:24.885]  So they just, again, they love, they go watch the movies and just enjoy it.
[02:09:24.885 --> 02:09:32.709]  And how they're killing you and how they told you they killed you, because you're supposed to publish a notice under universal law that you're going to kill somebody when you do it.
[02:09:32.709 --> 02:09:40.832]  Just like when you're going to destroy a building or take a piece of property by adverse possession that nobody's been claiming or paying taxes on, you've got to post it.
[02:09:40.832 --> 02:09:43.453]  And so, I haven't seen it yet, I'm going to try to go see it in the next few days.
[02:09:44.645 --> 02:09:50.166]  The new brainwashing James Bond movie, not because it's entertaining or good, but because I want to be able to analyze it, but I'm told that's what's in it.
[02:09:50.166 --> 02:09:58.488]  So I told you about it a long time ago, others told you about it, and now it's here, now it's confirmed, but it's in a movie, so it's, oh, you got that from the movie, yeah, right.
[02:09:58.488 --> 02:10:02.528]  So, let's go ahead and just give you some background here on the new thing, though.
[02:10:02.528 --> 02:10:11.170]  Remember we made a big deal about this last year, that in the year before that, in 2019, a bunch of people working for Bill Gates, Peter Daszak,
[02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:13.561]  And others, they don't work for the U.S.
[02:10:13.561 --> 02:10:17.083]  government, they don't work for the Canadian government, they don't work for the Chinese government.
[02:10:17.083 --> 02:10:23.788]  Just being honest, I hate the Chinese government, I hate communism, but as best we know, they're triple agents, like Spectre in a James Bond movie.
[02:10:23.788 --> 02:10:27.430]  They're a global corporate group above it all that plays the countries off against each other.
[02:10:27.430 --> 02:10:29.531]  But they've got operatives in every government as well.
[02:10:29.531 --> 02:10:32.093]  So they're telling you how the globalist Bilderberg Group works.
[02:10:32.093 --> 02:10:33.013]  Ian Fleming told you.
[02:10:33.013 --> 02:10:34.955]  The head of the Bilderberg Group is now the head of the Davos Group.
[02:10:35.728 --> 02:10:41.030]  Like, Cobra Commander goes behind the bushes at his meeting with a mask on, then he comes out as Klaus Schwab during the day.
[02:10:41.030 --> 02:10:41.910]  That's the allegory.
[02:10:41.910 --> 02:10:44.230]  I'm not literally saying Klaus Schwab's Cobra Commander.
[02:10:44.230 --> 02:10:47.551]  He's far worse because he's real.
[02:10:47.551 --> 02:10:48.352]  So, let's continue.
[02:10:48.352 --> 02:10:51.172]  But they tell you in all the literature and culture how it works.
[02:10:51.172 --> 02:11:02.155]  So, uninhabitable hell, climate change and disease threatens millions, UN warns.
[02:11:02.155 --> 02:11:03.736]  And it says right here.
[02:11:05.404 --> 02:11:10.247]  That, oh my God, this is like 2019, we're all going to be dead soon.
[02:11:10.247 --> 02:11:14.389]  Superviruses will emerge because it's going to get too hot.
[02:11:14.389 --> 02:11:16.110]  This is from Reuters.
[02:11:16.110 --> 02:11:18.571]  So when things emerge, oh, it's your fault, it's global warming.
[02:11:18.571 --> 02:11:20.052]  Remember they told you that last year.
[02:11:20.052 --> 02:11:20.952]  Worse is yet to come.
[02:11:20.952 --> 02:11:23.894]  Disastrous future ahead for millions worldwide due to climate change.
[02:11:23.894 --> 02:11:25.475]  Report says U.S.
[02:11:25.475 --> 02:11:25.955]  A to day.
[02:11:25.955 --> 02:11:33.219]  This is the same thing that hot weather is going to cause superviruses and life on Earth will not be able to recover and it's going to be unlivable and you're all going to die.
[02:11:35.939 --> 02:11:42.201]  So when they hit you with a bioweapon and they tell you it naturally came out of a cave in China or a wet market, you believe it.
[02:11:42.201 --> 02:11:43.702]  They're all pre-programming you.
[02:11:43.702 --> 02:11:46.563]  When the bioweapon comes, it was because you were bad.
[02:11:46.563 --> 02:11:48.003]  When you die, it's because you were bad.
[02:11:48.003 --> 02:11:48.623]  Okay, good.
[02:11:48.623 --> 02:11:49.744]  Okay, thank you.
[02:11:49.744 --> 02:11:51.644]  By the way, here's your new admiral.
[02:11:51.644 --> 02:11:53.545]  He's a transgender.
[02:11:53.545 --> 02:11:59.147]  Okay, so it says, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases will come from the heat.
[02:11:59.147 --> 02:12:01.948]  So a respiratory disease is going to kill you from the heat.
[02:12:01.948 --> 02:12:03.028]  It says right there, from the heat.
[02:12:05.473 --> 02:12:11.235]  Leaked UN draft report warns of accelerating climate devastation.
[02:12:11.235 --> 02:12:13.176]  Oh, but it wasn't out of a cave.
[02:12:13.176 --> 02:12:15.596]  It wasn't out of the jungles of Africa.
[02:12:15.596 --> 02:12:22.959]  It was, London Telegraph, Wuhan scientists plan to release coronavirus particles in the cave bats leaked papers reveal.
[02:12:24.517 --> 02:12:39.048]  Oh, and they planned to spray it in nanoparticles of synthetic viral delivery system of chimeric COVID spike proteins using skin-penetrating nanoparticles that also then replicate in the body.
[02:12:39.048 --> 02:12:44.652]  But don't worry, the scientist said it'll only replicate a few times so it won't spread to humans.
[02:12:44.652 --> 02:12:46.153]  Just like the real stuff they're spraying us with right now.
[02:12:47.441 --> 02:12:49.422]  Oh, and then here's a bunch of articles about the backgrounds.
[02:12:49.422 --> 02:12:55.945]  GADZIC admits Fauci funded Chinese coronavirus research conference featuring Hunter Biden leaked pandemic group.
[02:12:55.945 --> 02:12:56.625]  It goes on.
[02:12:56.625 --> 02:12:57.525]  So there's the background.
[02:12:57.525 --> 02:12:59.926]  Now, let me give you the new information.
[02:12:59.926 --> 02:13:04.828]  I always want to back things up, though, for you so that you understand what's going on here.
[02:13:04.828 --> 02:13:06.249]  You can look it up for yourself.
[02:13:06.249 --> 02:13:07.329]  Here's the new news.
[02:13:07.329 --> 02:13:09.870]  But to get the new news, let's go back a few years.
[02:13:09.870 --> 02:13:15.573]  As I said, in 2019, when they were getting all this cooked up and ready and creating plausible liability.
[02:13:17.506 --> 02:13:21.810]  And the experts have come out, the people involved, this is all the news.
[02:13:21.810 --> 02:13:41.930]  A group of Chinese government-connected, Peter Daszak-connected, Bill Gates-connected, Fauci-connected scientists snuck out of the lab, they call that steal, out of the lab in Canada, a virus that at that time killed 40% of humans that got it, but now they've souped it up at Wuhan to kill 80% and they're now admitting that.
[02:13:43.120 --> 02:13:48.182]  And so Fauci says, though, something far worse is coming, and he's now giving you a vaccine to lower your immunity to it.
[02:13:48.182 --> 02:13:49.162]  Okay.
[02:13:49.162 --> 02:13:50.582]  That was three years ago, two and a half years ago.
[02:13:50.582 --> 02:13:51.323]  Here's another one.
[02:13:51.323 --> 02:13:57.445]  Biowarfare expert questions why Canada was sending lethal viruses to China.
[02:13:57.445 --> 02:14:00.466]  That's the Edmonton Journal.
[02:14:00.466 --> 02:14:05.987]  World's deadliest viruses were shipped to Wuhan leak lab from Canada by rogue scientists linked to Chinese military.
[02:14:05.987 --> 02:14:07.548]  The Sun.
[02:14:07.548 --> 02:14:10.729]  Questions surround Canadian shipment of deadly viruses to China.
[02:14:12.432 --> 02:14:17.256]  Protocol ignored and pathogen transferred to Wing Ping's Microbiology Lab.
[02:14:17.256 --> 02:14:18.737]  Winnipeg Free Press.
[02:14:18.737 --> 02:14:25.201]  Canada's lab shipment of Ebola Hennepa viruses to China.
[02:14:25.201 --> 02:14:26.402]  Raise questions.
[02:14:26.402 --> 02:14:26.762]  CBC.
[02:14:27.861 --> 02:14:31.143]  Then they've got them merging them and creating them and all the rest of it here.
[02:14:31.143 --> 02:14:55.116]  Now, here's the next little juicy for you, out of CTV News, also out of Canada, last month, and they're not making a big deal about it, they just say suddenly, the very virus shipped in 2019 to the Wuhan lab that killed 40% of people then, has now for the first time popped up in India, China's big enemy,
[02:14:57.802 --> 02:15:00.764]  And it's killing the majority of people that get it.
[02:15:00.764 --> 02:15:02.004]  Okay.
[02:15:02.004 --> 02:15:04.165]  They don't put two and two together here and point that out.
[02:15:04.165 --> 02:15:12.510]  So, they get it, they ship it to a lab, they soup it up even more, it magically pops up for the first time, this variety, in India, and it's nothing to worry about.
[02:15:13.601 --> 02:15:14.342]  Okay.
[02:15:14.342 --> 02:15:18.845]  What is Nipah, the deadly virus emerging in India alongside COVID-19?
[02:15:18.845 --> 02:15:23.689]  And it goes on to say, well, it used to kill 40%, but now it kills 80%.
[02:15:23.689 --> 02:15:29.794]  And it's now able to jump into humans because it was zoologically just magically made the leap where it can do it now.
[02:15:29.794 --> 02:15:35.759]  So, oh, that's a small part of the stack today as they gear up to murder everyone.
[02:15:35.759 --> 02:15:38.161]  But they're doing it to save the Earth, right?
[02:15:38.161 --> 02:15:38.941]  We'll be right back.
[02:15:38.941 --> 02:15:40.563]  Infowars.com.
[02:15:40.563 --> 02:15:41.824]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:15:43.547 --> 02:15:44.508]  Hey everybody.
[02:15:44.508 --> 02:15:49.992]  If you've ever thought about heirloom beans as a storable survival food, I've got great news.
[02:15:49.992 --> 02:15:52.454]  In fact, I'll bet it's the best news you've heard in a while.
[02:15:52.454 --> 02:15:53.295]  Here's the thing.
[02:15:53.295 --> 02:15:57.598]  We've just received a fresh batch of gourmet heirloom beans.
[02:15:57.598 --> 02:15:58.539]  Survival soup beans.
[02:15:58.939 --> 02:16:07.123]  These beans are gorgeous, highly nutritious, and above all, with no hesitation whatsoever, the best tasting beans in the entire world.
[02:16:07.123 --> 02:16:08.224]  The best part?
[02:16:08.224 --> 02:16:17.249]  We've dropped the price by 33% this week for listeners who know higher food prices are coming and want an inflation hedge you can actually eat if you want to.
[02:16:17.509 --> 02:16:18.550]  Gets even better.
[02:16:18.550 --> 02:16:29.298]  With your permission, and with a high regard for your health and well-being, I also want to send you two pounds of what we think is the single most underrated superfood in the world.

[02:16:45.407 --> 02:16:47.489]  Your voice counts.
[02:16:47.489 --> 02:16:52.533]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[02:16:52.533 --> 02:16:55.135]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[02:16:55.135 --> 02:16:56.636]  They know you're angry.
[02:16:56.636 --> 02:17:01.460]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[02:17:51.749 --> 02:17:57.372]  Join Bill Gates, and together we will defeat humanity.
[02:17:58.632 --> 02:18:04.662]  Then our God Seat will reward us with eternal life.
[02:18:04.662 --> 02:18:07.526]  That's basically the ethos of The Globalist.
[02:18:09.238 --> 02:18:10.579]  They must first play God.
[02:18:10.579 --> 02:18:17.021]  They must first prove that they are the fittest in their social Darwinistic system.
[02:18:17.021 --> 02:18:18.442]  And in a way, they're right.
[02:18:18.442 --> 02:18:26.145]  If we let them lie to us and dumb us down and poison us and destroy our children's futures, the evidence is overwhelming and out in the open.
[02:18:26.145 --> 02:18:28.766]  We really deserve what's happened to us.
[02:18:29.838 --> 02:18:36.341]  So I ask you now, are you going to step up and expose the new old order even more?
[02:18:36.341 --> 02:18:39.983]  I know I'm pledging to step up and redouble my efforts.
[02:18:39.983 --> 02:18:44.005]  The front lines of the fight is infowars.com.
[02:18:44.005 --> 02:18:47.487]  The average person on the face of this incredible planet is still unaware.
[02:18:48.127 --> 02:18:57.889]  There's a war between free individuals and nation-states on one side, and the globalists on the other, who are literally trying to create a post-human world.
[02:18:57.889 --> 02:19:05.671]  From the United States to Brazil, and of course triggered by the Brexit in the UK, nations were pulling out of the private, corporate, fascist world government.
[02:19:05.671 --> 02:19:08.191]  That's why they launched their Great Recess.
[02:19:08.191 --> 02:19:11.772]  And they're programmed for collapsing us, of Build Back Better.
[02:19:12.912 --> 02:19:18.137]  This is nothing more than a top-down, vertical consolidation of the world economy.
[02:19:18.137 --> 02:19:29.008]  And because they couldn't take our guns, because we wouldn't bow, because the left, which is the ideology of this world government system, couldn't win, they released a biological weapon on us.
[02:19:29.748 --> 02:19:31.770]  Now we know two years ago.
[02:19:31.770 --> 02:19:34.072]  We learned about it about 20 months ago.
[02:19:34.072 --> 02:19:34.653]  It's that simple.
[02:19:34.653 --> 02:19:37.776]  They can't beat us because of our free speech and our guns.
[02:19:37.776 --> 02:19:41.960]  So the Global Corporate Combine released COVID-19 and you know the rest is history.
[02:19:41.960 --> 02:19:47.004]  Expose this paradigm and we win.
[02:19:47.004 --> 02:19:49.627]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:19:59.326 --> 02:20:01.848]  We are back live.
[02:20:01.848 --> 02:20:23.645]  I have had a lot of people ask me to respond in detail beyond the one video I did a few weeks ago when it was the top national news story, one of the biggest stories in the world, that Alex Jones found guilty of defaming and purposely lying about people like they have like something that read my mind.
[02:20:23.645 --> 02:20:24.626]  And you notice they said,
[02:20:25.959 --> 02:20:30.201]  Now a jury will decide how much money he owes because he's guilty.
[02:20:30.201 --> 02:20:34.803]  Since when do judges say who's guilty, and then a jury decides how much money you owe?
[02:20:34.803 --> 02:20:37.244]  Well, that's really never been done before.
[02:20:37.244 --> 02:20:46.649]  And two lawyers did a great job breaking this down back at the time that I wasn't aware of, and so we're going to play part of that coming up in the next segment.
[02:20:46.649 --> 02:20:49.370]  Now, I said I was going to hit that huge news, and I am briefly.
[02:20:50.131 --> 02:20:54.573]  But you cannot do it justice without reading it all.
[02:20:54.573 --> 02:21:03.797]  And it's probably, just in this little folder, probably 30 pages of stuff, 40 pages, that off of each little piece you can riff off of.
[02:21:03.797 --> 02:21:10.200]  But I promise you, we're going to be getting into it in great detail, because it's very, very positive, but also very, very scary information.
[02:21:11.340 --> 02:21:15.761]  I also have this big NATO information that is so important that people really aren't aware of.
[02:21:15.761 --> 02:21:19.122]  And so we've already covered that some in the last few days, but I'll be getting more into that.
[02:21:19.122 --> 02:21:22.262]  But let's just get back to this for a second.
[02:21:22.262 --> 02:21:35.345]  I showed you mainstream news, government documents, admissions that Fauci, through Peter Daszak, with Bill Gates' money, didn't just create COVID-19 and said they were going to release it open air and create nanoparticles that replicate and pierce your skin.
[02:21:38.715 --> 02:21:41.597]  They didn't just power grab and censor people that exposed it.
[02:21:41.597 --> 02:21:44.919]  They didn't just block therapeutics that would protect people.
[02:21:44.919 --> 02:21:48.602]  They didn't just bring in a world government, a world ID under it.
[02:21:48.602 --> 02:21:58.829]  But they, then we learned, got hundreds of other super deadly viruses, far worse, and are still there souping them up at the Wuhan lab.
[02:21:58.829 --> 02:22:05.194]  And I guess they'll release another one and then they'll also be the spokespersons that tell us they're in charge and tell us what to do and tell us what to put in our bodies.
[02:22:07.113 --> 02:22:11.897]  This is so over-the-top, and it's meant to be over-the-top, because it's just so ridiculous what they're doing.
[02:22:11.897 --> 02:22:21.684]  People can't believe that the guy running all this, quarterback-producing it and releasing it, and then they had it stolen out of the lab, which they shouldn't even be making up in Canada.
[02:22:21.684 --> 02:22:28.029]  And Justin Trudeau, who's totally a Chinese communist agent, and says he wants to set up a dictatorship in Canada, modeled after Xi Jinping.
[02:22:28.029 --> 02:22:28.810]  I mean, that happened.
[02:22:29.946 --> 02:22:36.275]  And then lo and behold, he's got Chinese troops training up there and has the military spying on the citizens and the head general goes public and they fire him.
[02:22:36.275 --> 02:22:37.678]  I mean, this is crazy!
[02:22:39.855 --> 02:22:41.636]  Well, if they did that, people blow the whistle.
[02:22:41.636 --> 02:22:42.917]  They do!
[02:22:42.917 --> 02:22:43.938]  And they fire them!
[02:22:43.938 --> 02:22:47.441]  And then they put in some, you know, woman in a four-star general outfit.
[02:22:47.441 --> 02:22:49.202]  That's what they do.
[02:22:49.202 --> 02:22:52.305]  And Millie up there saying, our military is racist and evil.
[02:22:52.305 --> 02:22:53.766]  White people are inherently bad.
[02:22:53.766 --> 02:22:56.508]  I mean, this is a takeover.
[02:22:56.508 --> 02:22:58.490]  They don't say we're globalist or depopulated.
[02:22:58.490 --> 02:23:02.793]  I mean, they do say that, but to the general public, it's you're racist, you're bad, America's evil.
[02:23:02.793 --> 02:23:05.695]  Yeah, we're flying in hundreds of thousands of kids and disappearing, no big deal.
[02:23:05.695 --> 02:23:07.336]  Just to shut up.
[02:23:07.336 --> 02:23:07.517]  Look.
[02:23:08.274 --> 02:23:11.156]  Four-star admiral is a woman.
[02:23:11.156 --> 02:23:12.377]  Aren't you excited?
[02:23:12.377 --> 02:23:14.779]  And it's a man.
[02:23:14.779 --> 02:23:22.325]  So this is just mass behavioral psychology confusing and scrambling and just smoke-screening and befuddling everybody.
[02:23:22.325 --> 02:23:23.366]  It's called the fog of war.
[02:23:25.816 --> 02:23:40.703]  So it's totally illegal and evil for Canada to be making this stuff and claiming, oh, because they want to be able to counter it, but then to create new viruses and splice them with it so it can jump into humans and then send it to Wuhan so they can release it on the world and then say, oh, was it America?
[02:23:40.703 --> 02:23:41.523]  Was it Canada?
[02:23:41.523 --> 02:23:43.184]  Was it China?
[02:23:43.184 --> 02:23:44.584]  Was it the UN?
[02:23:44.584 --> 02:23:45.505]  Was it Bill Gates?
[02:23:45.505 --> 02:23:47.606]  That's who it was.
[02:23:47.606 --> 02:23:49.907]  So we're living in a biological weapon attack.
[02:23:51.206 --> 02:24:02.372]  And I've got, like, writers calling me in national news all the time, oh, do a big interview, oh, do a big biopic on you, do a movie on you, and I'm just like, none of that's even gonna exist.
[02:24:02.372 --> 02:24:09.195]  Do you understand they did a test weapon with something that kills old people, people that are already sick, to see how you'd respond.
[02:24:09.195 --> 02:24:12.457]  Then they released something a little more worse, just as I predicted they would.
[02:24:13.217 --> 02:24:14.377]  Because they want to control things.
[02:24:14.377 --> 02:24:15.978]  They don't want to release really bad stuff up front.
[02:24:15.978 --> 02:24:18.539]  And now they're telling you, OK, something far worse is coming.
[02:24:18.539 --> 02:24:19.219]  Get ready.
[02:24:19.219 --> 02:24:22.221]  Go in your houses and lock up when it happens.
[02:24:22.221 --> 02:24:24.402]  They're just going to fly over with drones and spray it on your house.
[02:24:24.402 --> 02:24:24.882]  You're going to die.
[02:24:25.868 --> 02:24:29.332]  So I mean, I'm sitting there looking at the clock going, man, I'm white knuckling this.
[02:24:29.332 --> 02:24:33.898]  I really ought to get to some middle of the nowhere log cabin a hundred miles from anywhere.
[02:24:33.898 --> 02:24:38.504]  If I was a selfish person, I'm looking at my four year old daughter, so beautiful and good this morning, so full of God's light.
[02:24:38.504 --> 02:24:41.347]  And I'm just thinking, man, should I just pull up?
[02:24:41.347 --> 02:24:42.849]  I just, I should get the hell out of here right now.
[02:24:43.578 --> 02:24:45.718]  Just the public, they're not going to listen.
[02:24:45.718 --> 02:24:47.779]  They're just going to have to get exterminated.
[02:24:47.779 --> 02:24:48.999]  And I don't want to die with them.
[02:24:48.999 --> 02:24:51.659]  And believe me, all the people I know have already left.
[02:24:51.659 --> 02:24:53.480]  All the smart money already split.
[02:24:53.480 --> 02:24:57.881]  I mean, it's America and Australia and New Zealand and Canada and the UK.
[02:24:57.881 --> 02:25:04.422]  We're marked for death because of the Christian ethos and our background and our historical opposition to the New World Order.
[02:25:04.422 --> 02:25:07.162]  They took us over because of our power to take over the world.
[02:25:07.162 --> 02:25:08.983]  Now they want to get rid of who helped them take over the world.
[02:25:12.199 --> 02:25:15.081]  And they're telling you, you know, the cataclysm's here, the end of the world's here.
[02:25:15.081 --> 02:25:17.002]  They mean the end of the world for us.
[02:25:17.002 --> 02:25:19.643]  And so, it's just, it's ridiculous.
[02:25:19.643 --> 02:25:25.546]  It's absolutely ridiculous to see judges, you know, out there attacking us and taking away our due process and doing North Korea stuff.
[02:25:25.546 --> 02:25:26.827]  People go, aren't you upset about that?
[02:25:26.827 --> 02:25:29.108]  I'm like, that doesn't even matter!
[02:25:29.108 --> 02:25:30.469]  Do you understand that?
[02:25:30.469 --> 02:25:37.953]  They have produced a virus that kills 80% of people, and they admit they've got it, and it's in mainstream news that Fauci got it, and has it at the damn lab!
[02:25:37.953 --> 02:25:38.953]  He's holding us hostage!
[02:25:38.953 --> 02:25:39.734]  Do you understand that?
[02:25:42.079 --> 02:25:51.512]  And all your race politics and all your political crap doesn't matter anymore if we don't get a major awakening in the intelligence agencies.
[02:25:53.171 --> 02:25:56.292]  And in governments and in corporations, to put the brakes on this, it's over.
[02:25:56.292 --> 02:26:00.534]  I saw Jon Stewart was on TV this weekend on CNN going, let's stop fighting left and right.
[02:26:00.534 --> 02:26:01.935]  Listen, Trump's not really that bad.
[02:26:01.935 --> 02:26:03.695]  We need to stop all the censorship.
[02:26:03.695 --> 02:26:04.536]  This is really bad.
[02:26:04.536 --> 02:26:05.596]  You need to stop.
[02:26:05.596 --> 02:26:09.638]  And they're not listening, folks, because they're going full bore.
[02:26:09.638 --> 02:26:15.541]  And everybody that isn't totally satanic on the other side is like, well, we wanted to run things, but not do this.
[02:26:15.541 --> 02:26:16.801]  What's going on?
[02:26:16.801 --> 02:26:19.802]  Well, I mean, because, you know, Jon Stewart's brother runs the New York Stock Exchange.
[02:26:19.802 --> 02:26:20.643]  Heavily hooked up.
[02:26:20.643 --> 02:26:21.003]  He knows.
[02:26:22.250 --> 02:26:24.995]  You look scared, folks, and you should be.
[02:26:24.995 --> 02:26:32.068]  People should be really scared, because the globalists know about intention and focus and will and the power of humans to change the universe around us.
[02:26:32.068 --> 02:26:34.933]  That is observer effect quantum physics.
[02:26:34.933 --> 02:26:35.173]  Proven!
[02:26:36.149 --> 02:26:44.458]  And they have that power, and they know if you believe in that power and connect to God, and then have God's will, that you can literally move mountains.
[02:26:44.458 --> 02:26:50.044]  Not some magic trick, not some Jedi thing, Luke Skywalker, you know, picking up rocks with Yoda.
[02:26:50.044 --> 02:26:58.192]  I mean change the universe in the way energy interacts with other humans and other systems with positive wavelengths and destructive wavelengths.
[02:26:58.192 --> 02:26:58.553]  Lower
[02:27:00.771 --> 02:27:07.937]  Energy that's coming in from the first and second dimensions, that simple way of saying human, that tends to be very destructive and hateful.
[02:27:07.937 --> 02:27:10.179]  They try to harness that and control it, but you can't.
[02:27:10.179 --> 02:27:15.743]  And then higher energy waves that are fueling the third dimension.
[02:27:15.743 --> 02:27:24.730]  It's like a Roman arch, where there's no cement between the big blocks, but they perfectly weigh together and then come together with the keystone right in the middle.
[02:27:24.730 --> 02:27:30.035]  That's how the dimensions hold each other together, like a Roman arch.
[02:27:31.015 --> 02:27:34.318]  That's a simple three-dimensional rendering for you.
[02:27:34.318 --> 02:27:39.283]  And there's charges coming down in it, and charges coming up into it.
[02:27:39.283 --> 02:27:40.945]  And they don't even really say that in their literature.
[02:27:40.945 --> 02:27:43.968]  We get deeper into the quantum mechanics and the rest of it, and they know that.
[02:27:43.968 --> 02:27:50.254]  And it's what the alchemists knew inherently as primitive humans, but they could express it, but didn't understand it all.
[02:27:50.254 --> 02:27:54.879]  Now they've got devices that can read it, and the Hadron Superconducting Super Collider, and more.
[02:27:56.052 --> 02:28:03.677]  And they're using our power to tell us, you're ugly, you're bad, the end of the world's coming, giant cataclysm, you need to die, 2030, everyone's going to die.
[02:28:03.677 --> 02:28:05.018]  They mean us.
[02:28:05.018 --> 02:28:05.899]  And they're out there saying it.
[02:28:05.899 --> 02:28:08.280]  William Shatner, AOC, Beto O'Rourke.
[02:28:08.280 --> 02:28:09.221]  And they're kind of the outside.
[02:28:09.221 --> 02:28:12.683]  They get taken to meetings and told, oh, the pole shift's going to do it.
[02:28:12.683 --> 02:28:15.225]  Oh, the virus is out of the jungle, we're going to do it.
[02:28:15.225 --> 02:28:16.826]  And so they've not been given the full thing.
[02:28:16.826 --> 02:28:19.368]  They're just scared, going, everybody's going to die, I'm so sad.
[02:28:19.368 --> 02:28:20.809]  You're all going to die, I'm so sad for you.
[02:28:20.809 --> 02:28:21.950]  They don't have the full story.
[02:28:24.471 --> 02:28:26.133]  So, I mean, it's here.
[02:28:26.133 --> 02:28:26.553]  It's here.
[02:28:26.553 --> 02:28:28.755]  I mean, just, they have initiated this.
[02:28:28.755 --> 02:28:29.896]  I hope we can stop it.
[02:28:29.896 --> 02:28:30.957]  I hope we can back them down.
[02:28:30.957 --> 02:28:34.601]  I hope we get a reprieve like Ninema, but who knows, folks?
[02:28:34.601 --> 02:28:35.141]  Who knows?
[02:28:35.141 --> 02:28:37.163]  Alright, more coming up.
[02:28:37.163 --> 02:28:37.544]  Stay with us.
[02:28:43.513 --> 02:28:51.939]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[02:28:51.939 --> 02:28:52.959]  Here's why.
[02:28:52.959 --> 02:28:56.882]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[02:28:56.882 --> 02:29:02.005]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[02:29:02.005 --> 02:29:10.411]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes, and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[02:29:10.991 --> 02:29:18.986]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:29:19.691 --> 02:29:25.773]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses too!
[02:29:25.773 --> 02:29:29.594]  Go to MySolarBackup.com to learn more and check availability.
[02:29:29.594 --> 02:29:31.615]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[02:29:31.615 --> 02:29:40.018]  Look for the free report, Crisis Cooling, how to make absolutely sure your meat, milk, and medicines stay safe and cool in any power outage.
[02:29:40.018 --> 02:29:42.379]  Yours free at MySolarBackup.com.
[02:29:44.591 --> 02:29:48.393]  Back in stock, down-and-out liquid sleep support.
[02:29:48.393 --> 02:29:49.754]  It's been out of stock for a while.
[02:29:49.754 --> 02:29:53.536]  It's one of three sleep aids we have at Infowarstore.com.
[02:29:53.536 --> 02:29:54.737]  This one has been very popular.
[02:29:54.737 --> 02:29:55.918]  It's sold off the shelves.
[02:29:55.918 --> 02:29:59.800]  It's back in stock, down-and-out liquid sleep support.
[02:29:59.800 --> 02:30:05.643]  This is probably the strongest sleep aid that we have, I would say.
[02:30:05.643 --> 02:30:08.565]  Knockout, Rocket Rest, both great.
[02:30:08.565 --> 02:30:09.966]  Comes in pill form.
[02:30:09.966 --> 02:30:13.448]  This is the liquid tincture, and I think this is probably the most powerful one.
[02:30:13.968 --> 02:30:15.970]  Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine.
[02:30:15.970 --> 02:30:21.874]  This is, if you haven't done an iodine challenge yet, if you haven't done the iodine challenge, what are you waiting for?
[02:30:21.874 --> 02:30:22.875]  Now is the time.
[02:30:22.875 --> 02:30:25.477]  Super Male and Super Female Vitality.
[02:30:25.477 --> 02:30:29.600]  Living Defense Plus and the Organic Greens Fiber Caps.
[02:30:29.600 --> 02:30:34.524]  We have a limited supply of these right now, but we want to sell them all out so we can order a new batch.
[02:30:34.524 --> 02:30:35.544]  It was very popular.
[02:30:35.544 --> 02:30:38.847]  The Organic Greens Fiber Caps, but we have all kinds of other great supplements.
[02:30:39.187 --> 02:30:41.928]  That are great for so many different things.
[02:30:41.928 --> 02:30:46.291]  Take advantage of those.
[02:30:46.291 --> 02:30:50.273]  I want to explain something that is absolutely key to understanding our world.
[02:30:50.273 --> 02:30:53.214]  It's very, very simple, but the most people don't know.
[02:30:53.214 --> 02:31:05.101]  The privately owned central banks of the world are artificially creating thousands of trillions of dollars in other major currencies and using them to buy up infrastructure,
[02:31:06.101 --> 02:31:22.921]  Intellectual property, energy, they're using it to buy people, to buy influence, and in the past they created thousands of trillions so that they could leverage that, manipulate markets, but they never allowed that money to get into the general circulation or it would cause massive inflation.
[02:31:23.522 --> 02:31:39.366]  Now they've gone ahead and weaponized it and are flooding every sector of the world economy, buying up everything, not to have the companies operate, but to actually shut them down and force a collapse of civilization, making the companies they do fund be the only things left standing.
[02:31:39.366 --> 02:31:40.626]  This is the Great Reset.
[02:31:40.626 --> 02:31:41.986]  This is what's happening now.
[02:31:41.986 --> 02:31:42.747]  Warn everyone.
[02:31:42.747 --> 02:31:43.727]  It's the only way to stop it.
[02:31:44.645 --> 02:31:54.108]  I'm taping this message on the morning of Tuesday, October 19, 2021, and I've got some great news to report to the listeners.
[02:31:54.108 --> 02:32:05.211]  For at least one week, we're going to be able to run a sale with Bobby's Ultimate Turmeric Formula that just got back in stock after being sold out almost five months because of supply chain breakdowns.
[02:32:05.211 --> 02:32:09.113]  It has a 95% curcuminoid level.
[02:32:09.113 --> 02:32:12.654]  Most of the turmeric supplements have a 5% to 10% curcuminoid level.
[02:32:13.414 --> 02:32:16.797]  Our leading competitor has a 75% humanoid level.
[02:32:16.797 --> 02:32:19.800]  This is a special proprietary concentrate.
[02:32:19.800 --> 02:32:22.943]  It is so good for inflammation, for your immune system.
[02:32:22.943 --> 02:32:25.145]  It's an antioxidant for your whole body.
[02:32:25.145 --> 02:32:26.466]  It's documented.
[02:32:26.466 --> 02:32:27.908]  It's amazing.
[02:32:27.908 --> 02:32:31.171]  Everybody knows that turmeric is an incredible thing that God created.
[02:32:31.171 --> 02:32:32.992]  And bodies is the strongest and best.
[02:32:32.992 --> 02:32:36.656]  You're gonna find, and it's back in stock, and it funds the info war.
[02:32:37.876 --> 02:32:40.918]  40% off for a limited time, then it goes back to regular price right now.
[02:32:40.918 --> 02:32:48.081]  Dimpfulworkstore.com, running this special for one week.
[02:32:48.081 --> 02:32:50.723]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:09.836 --> 02:33:30.517]  Alright, I'm going to cover this story some, not because I'm right in the middle of it, but because I don't think some of the public realizes how bad this is, how unusual this is, but how it's becoming very common in blue cities and blue states.
[02:33:31.724 --> 02:33:39.192]  People ask, why do you live in Austin, Texas, when it's basically the dumping ground of people that are leaving collapsed California?
[02:33:39.192 --> 02:33:47.521]  And it's because my mother's from here, and my ancestors, going back to the 1820s on her side and the 1820s on my dad's side, are from Texas.
[02:33:49.463 --> 02:33:52.164]  On both sides of the family, we're founding members of the state.
[02:33:52.164 --> 02:33:54.284]  On my mom's side, it's ridiculous.
[02:33:54.284 --> 02:33:58.606]  People actually had the plan with Jackson behind the scenes, the whole deal.
[02:33:58.606 --> 02:33:59.806]  It's where I live.
[02:33:59.806 --> 02:34:00.726]  It's been conquered.
[02:34:00.726 --> 02:34:03.327]  It's been captured.
[02:34:03.327 --> 02:34:10.069]  Many of the judges are complete political operatives and do things like indict Rick Perry criminally for vetoing a bill.
[02:34:10.069 --> 02:34:11.809]  That's totally constitutional.
[02:34:11.809 --> 02:34:15.210]  But they still tried to have a court and have a jury and put him in prison.
[02:34:15.210 --> 02:34:16.531]  He had to spend $2 million to beat it.
[02:34:18.911 --> 02:34:22.734]  In my view, this is real criminal activity.
[02:34:22.734 --> 02:34:27.237]  And it's the judicial system weaponized, stalking Texans.
[02:34:27.237 --> 02:34:34.061]  Austin's like a leftist mothership, or a cancer, right here in the middle of the city attacking everybody.
[02:34:34.061 --> 02:34:40.545]  And so folks need to understand, I don't get a trial to say I'm innocent or guilty with a jury.
[02:34:40.545 --> 02:34:44.467]  The judge says I'm guilty, says I gave them no information, which is totally not true.
[02:34:47.165 --> 02:34:50.709]  Barnes points out, we scanned through millions of documents.
[02:34:50.709 --> 02:34:53.792]  We gave them hundreds of thousands total in Connecticut and Texas.
[02:34:53.792 --> 02:34:54.713]  Depositions, everything.
[02:34:54.713 --> 02:34:57.916]  I've never been allowed to depose or even have one document in Texas.
[02:34:57.916 --> 02:35:00.199]  We asked for that and she said, you're defaulted.
[02:35:00.199 --> 02:35:03.202]  She was a new judge, another judge handed it over after COVID.
[02:35:03.202 --> 02:35:04.783]  So think of the magnitude of that.
[02:35:05.504 --> 02:35:09.086]  Where I've never gotten one document, never had a chance to depose anybody.
[02:35:09.086 --> 02:35:10.127]  She says, you don't.
[02:35:10.127 --> 02:35:12.408]  But she's got me in depositions again in a couple weeks.
[02:35:12.408 --> 02:35:15.610]  She's like, oh, but the depositions continue, but you never gave us anything.
[02:35:15.610 --> 02:35:20.812]  So, I mean, this is beyond a kangaroo court, beyond a kangaroo trial, because at least there they have kangaroos.
[02:35:20.812 --> 02:35:22.853]  This is no judge or trial at all.
[02:35:22.853 --> 02:35:23.414]  So here it is.
[02:35:24.571 --> 02:35:25.292]  All right.
[02:35:25.292 --> 02:35:29.054]  Let's go on to the one that is also equally interesting.
[02:35:29.054 --> 02:35:33.117]  Alex Jones is you'll tell me if I'm wrong, Robert.
[02:35:33.117 --> 02:35:35.159]  Did he not just get screwed royally?
[02:35:35.159 --> 02:35:37.381]  And but how?
[02:35:37.381 --> 02:35:42.244]  So, I mean, there's a lot of Alex Jones defamation lawsuits in different jurisdictions.
[02:35:42.244 --> 02:35:45.467]  But the bottom line, I think this is in Texas.
[02:35:45.467 --> 02:35:47.268]  This was in Texas, right?
[02:35:47.268 --> 02:35:47.928]  Yes.
[02:35:47.928 --> 02:35:48.429]  And the judge.
[02:35:50.267 --> 02:35:51.427]  Spoiler alert!
[02:35:51.427 --> 02:35:56.850]  The judge came out with a default judgment against him, which basically adjudicated on the merits of the defamation claim.
[02:35:56.850 --> 02:36:00.412]  Basically, Robert, unless I'm mistaken... This is another prominent lawyer in Canada.
[02:36:00.412 --> 02:36:01.893]  He's guilty of defamation.
[02:36:01.893 --> 02:36:02.853]  Default judgment.
[02:36:02.853 --> 02:36:03.394]  Viva Free.
[02:36:03.394 --> 02:36:08.617]  How you get a default judgment under these circumstances, you're gonna elucidate me and everyone watching.
[02:36:08.617 --> 02:36:09.637]  He's guilty.
[02:36:09.637 --> 02:36:12.098]  Now the only question is how much?
[02:36:12.098 --> 02:36:16.441]  Yeah, I mean, because the media pretended that there had been a judgment on the merits.
[02:36:17.531 --> 02:36:26.538]  Both the plaintiff's lawyer and the court are scared of an Austin jury giving a judgment on the merits because they denied Alex Jones his constitutional right.
[02:36:27.102 --> 02:36:29.043]  To a jury trial on the merits.
[02:36:29.043 --> 02:36:37.188]  What the court did, and this is what's happening in liberal jurisdictions, it's why I've been telling clients of mine for a decade to get out of liberal jurisdictions.
[02:36:37.188 --> 02:36:39.169]  Don't be in the Austins of the world.
[02:36:39.169 --> 02:36:46.853]  Don't be, and for, you know, Michael Malice, other people moving to Austin, I get it, but that's as bad as New York, legally.
[02:36:46.853 --> 02:36:48.414]  There's no difference.
[02:36:48.414 --> 02:36:56.418]  They're politically, they're even more nuts because they are annoyed at how the state doesn't agree with them, the state that surrounds them.
[02:36:57.197 --> 02:36:59.278]  And so they're even more uber aggressive.
[02:36:59.278 --> 02:37:04.401]  So the Austin judges are increasingly openly, overtly political.
[02:37:04.401 --> 02:37:09.184]  The prosecutor that got elected in Austin was backed by George Soros related groups.
[02:37:09.184 --> 02:37:11.865]  I mean, that's the mindset of the political groups there in Austin.
[02:37:11.865 --> 02:37:16.008]  And they're eager to punish their political adversaries.
[02:37:16.008 --> 02:37:20.190]  And so that this is a suit that wouldn't have been brought in most places in the country.
[02:37:21.434 --> 02:37:26.516]  It would have been thrown out on First Amendment grounds in most places in the country, but not in Austin.
[02:37:26.516 --> 02:37:31.138]  And the bigger problem is the Court of Appeals in Austin is also mostly in Austin.
[02:37:31.138 --> 02:37:32.398]  So it's all Democrats.
[02:37:32.398 --> 02:37:39.361]  So you have a conservative state, but if you live in Austin, you have almost all liberal Democrats ruling on your cases.
[02:37:39.361 --> 02:37:44.103]  And they have proven over the past decade that they have no recognition of their limits.
[02:37:45.013 --> 02:37:59.857]  And so what happened here is, here's a guy, and Alex Jones, and his other, the other defendants that are sued, Infowars, etc., produced millions of pages and documents and testimony and email and videos and hours.
[02:37:59.857 --> 02:38:01.377]  I mean, you add it together.
[02:38:01.377 --> 02:38:05.418]  Produced all kinds of videos, all kind of audio files, all kind of email files.
[02:38:05.418 --> 02:38:07.879]  They even produced the spam email.
[02:38:07.879 --> 02:38:10.319]  I mean, just email that they've just been spammed with.
[02:38:10.319 --> 02:38:11.100]  They never even read.
[02:38:11.100 --> 02:38:12.340]  They produced all of that.
[02:38:12.890 --> 02:38:17.854]  They sat for days and days and days of depositions.
[02:38:17.854 --> 02:38:22.979]  More invasive discovery than ever has been allowed in the history of anti-slap cases in the country.
[02:38:22.979 --> 02:38:27.002]  Then he does a second round of discovery after all of that.
[02:38:27.002 --> 02:38:35.790]  And after producing more discovery than I think any media defendant has ever produced, the court says, oh, that's not enough.
[02:38:35.790 --> 02:38:37.411]  I'm not going to let you have a jury trial.
[02:38:38.715 --> 02:38:39.855]  Judgement for the plaintiff.
[02:38:39.855 --> 02:38:46.837]  But just so everybody appreciates this, because this was your tweet, and then someone cheekily reported, that's a nice way to phrase the judgment.
[02:38:46.837 --> 02:38:49.418]  This was not, I'm not going to let you have a jury trial.
[02:38:49.418 --> 02:38:52.478]  This was, I'm not going to let you have a trial, as far as I understand it.
[02:38:52.478 --> 02:38:57.740]  They basically said, no jury trial, no bench trial, no summary judgment motion, none of it.
[02:38:57.740 --> 02:39:06.982]  It says, effectively, you defaulted in such an egregious way on communicating answers to undertakings, I forget what the word is in the States, that I'm basically saying you're guilty by
[02:39:08.186 --> 02:39:11.987]  Your conduct in the file, not by the merits of the file.
[02:39:11.987 --> 02:39:14.648]  So, I had a file like this back in the day.
[02:39:14.648 --> 02:39:15.188]  It was a big one.
[02:39:15.188 --> 02:39:17.149]  It was a well-known American guy.
[02:39:17.149 --> 02:39:29.473]  This is all public, but names are irrelevant, who got a default judgment in the United States, because apparently the conduct was so egregious in the courts that they rendered a several hundred million dollar judgment against the individual.
[02:39:29.473 --> 02:39:32.975]  By default, no trial, no ability to defend.
[02:39:32.975 --> 02:39:37.016]  They basically said, your behavior was so over the top, you're guilty.
[02:39:37.823 --> 02:39:45.449]  By default, they took the default judgment, brought it over to Canada and then tried to seize, you know, hundreds of millions of dollars worth of assets.
[02:39:45.449 --> 02:39:55.236]  This is seems to what happened in this case is in the context of the procedure of the file, they say you defaulted or you didn't communicate answers to undertakings.
[02:39:55.236 --> 02:39:57.698]  You were jerking the court around, even if it's true.
[02:39:57.698 --> 02:40:00.660]  I don't think it's true, but let's just assume it's true.
[02:40:00.660 --> 02:40:04.703]  You screwed around so badly that we're just saying you're guilty by default.
[02:40:05.467 --> 02:40:06.368]  Guilty.
[02:40:06.368 --> 02:40:12.596]  Now let's go to the amount and you don't even get to have a substantiation of the allegations against you on the merits.
[02:40:12.596 --> 02:40:15.500]  It's a foregone conclusion because you've behaved so badly.
[02:40:15.500 --> 02:40:16.922]  That's what happened to him.
[02:40:17.802 --> 02:40:19.783]  That's what the court ruled.
[02:40:19.783 --> 02:40:24.227]  And to give people an idea, these kind of death penalty sanctions, that's what they're known as.
[02:40:24.227 --> 02:40:28.009]  Because they're denying you your right to get discovery from the other side.
[02:40:28.009 --> 02:40:41.799]  They're denying you the right to a summary judgment motion, which in Texas you have a right to go up through the appellate process before you even get to trial if it's a certain kind of electronic media defendant involved.
[02:40:41.799 --> 02:40:45.762]  They're denying you a right to a bench trial and denying you a right to a jury trial.
[02:40:46.654 --> 02:40:47.994]  They're denying you all of it.
[02:40:47.994 --> 02:41:00.578]  It's considered such a severe sanction, courts have repeatedly said it should never really be given outside of absolutely extraordinary, extreme circumstances with multiple warnings.
[02:41:00.578 --> 02:41:05.639]  To give people an example, the only time it's issued is when someone produces no discovery ever.
[02:41:06.119 --> 02:41:07.240]  Let me stop you on there, Robert.
[02:41:07.240 --> 02:41:14.365]  I think even producing no discovery would still be contempt, but when there's evidence that they've destroyed documentation might be when you get it.
[02:41:14.365 --> 02:41:18.288]  I mean, take it more... You have to have multiple layers of it, even then.
[02:41:18.288 --> 02:41:22.171]  Because typically, even if they destroyed evidence, there's other remedies that are available.
[02:41:22.171 --> 02:41:30.638]  So, if you need to produce, like in the federal system, for example, if there's been an allegation of destruction of evidence, you have to prove that you can't get that evidence any other way.
[02:41:31.498 --> 02:41:38.345]  You have to prove that an evidentiary inference wouldn't be favorable, wouldn't be enough, or other fear.
[02:41:38.345 --> 02:41:40.046]  And that's almost never the case.
[02:41:40.046 --> 02:41:42.909]  I mean, it's almost like this would be the kind of case.
[02:41:42.909 --> 02:41:44.811]  You have a video of the incident.
[02:41:44.811 --> 02:41:46.692]  It's the only video of the incident.
[02:41:46.692 --> 02:41:49.155]  There's no other witness testimony available.
[02:41:49.155 --> 02:41:50.916]  You're ordered to produce it.
[02:41:50.916 --> 02:41:51.677]  You destroy it.
[02:41:52.563 --> 02:41:55.987]  That's the kind of thing where they consider severe sanction.
[02:41:55.987 --> 02:41:58.610]  But even there, they usually give you an evidentiary sanction.
[02:41:58.610 --> 02:42:02.275]  They say you get to assume that whatever was on that tape was bad for the other party.
[02:42:03.101 --> 02:42:05.683]  That's the typical remedy.
[02:42:05.683 --> 02:42:21.715]  The law, because these are constitutional rights, rights to due process of law, rights to a trial, and rights to trial by jury, that are being stripped of someone, it can only be done under extreme and extraordinary circumstances, but the left doesn't recognize these rules.
[02:42:21.715 --> 02:42:22.636]  They don't care about them.
[02:42:22.636 --> 02:42:24.457]  They're like, we don't like you, you're Alex
[02:42:25.177 --> 02:42:26.378]  Alright, when we come back, we've got it.
[02:42:26.378 --> 02:42:38.283]  It gets even more powerful, but you have to understand, this is a precedent for everybody, and he gets it now, they're doing it all over the country now, and then, just saying, you're guilty, you owe money, and then lying, lying, and saying we gave them no information.
[02:42:38.283 --> 02:42:41.705]  We want to have a jury trial, we want to show the facts, because nothing they've said is true.
[02:42:44.172 --> 02:42:51.914]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with poisons and chemicals added to the foods.
[02:42:51.914 --> 02:42:53.415]  It's all come out.
[02:42:53.415 --> 02:43:00.177]  And they're doing that not because we're weak, but because we're made in the image of God, the Creator, and we are powerful.
[02:43:00.177 --> 02:43:03.418]  And the social engineers fear that so much.
[02:43:03.418 --> 02:43:09.180]  So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up with, but boy, is it true.
[02:43:11.092 --> 02:43:16.897]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[02:43:16.897 --> 02:43:29.128]  They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural death because they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on to the god of this world who is a loser.
[02:43:29.648 --> 02:43:33.591]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keep InfoWars on the air now more than ever.
[02:43:33.591 --> 02:43:39.276]  Because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists are manifesting and setting up is satanic.
[02:43:39.276 --> 02:43:43.079]  And we are opposing the one world government and the Mark of the Beast they just announced.
[02:43:43.757 --> 02:43:49.861]  One of the most studied and researched areas of human health and physiology is inflammation.
[02:43:49.861 --> 02:43:51.201]  It's associated with cancer.
[02:43:51.201 --> 02:43:52.922]  It's associated with joint problems.
[02:43:52.922 --> 02:43:56.024]  It's associated with viral infections, bacterial infections.
[02:43:56.024 --> 02:43:57.705]  It's associated with death.
[02:43:57.705 --> 02:44:06.130]  And out of all the incredible compounds that God gave us through nature that fights inflammation and makes our lives better, turmeric is chief amongst them all.
[02:44:06.130 --> 02:44:11.393]  And chief amongst all the turmeric products out there is body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[02:44:11.781 --> 02:44:12.881]  My wife loves turmeric.
[02:44:12.881 --> 02:44:17.823]  She has joint pain, but she has to take a lot of it, the type of stuff she buys at the grocery store, for it to work.
[02:44:17.823 --> 02:44:20.844]  She started taking this and said, I only need to take one pill instead of four.
[02:44:20.844 --> 02:44:22.064]  Why is it so good?
[02:44:22.064 --> 02:44:23.385]  It's not just turmeric.
[02:44:23.385 --> 02:44:26.446]  It's concentrated with a proprietary process.
[02:44:26.446 --> 02:44:27.526]  It's back in stock.
[02:44:27.526 --> 02:44:33.188]  They're being sold out almost five months at Infowarsstore.com for 40% off.
[02:44:33.188 --> 02:44:38.230]  But supplies are going to sell out quick because of supply chain breakdowns and because we will not lower the quality of this product.
[02:44:41.671 --> 02:44:50.614]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action, and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[02:44:50.614 --> 02:45:00.038]  Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly, and debilitating experimental injection because they were told to be afraid of an invisible, asymptomatic disease.
[02:45:00.678 --> 02:45:10.629]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years.
[02:45:10.629 --> 02:45:17.396]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening, and it's unbelievably unsettling to see.
[02:45:17.396 --> 02:45:18.817]  But there is only two things to do.
[02:45:19.938 --> 02:45:23.080]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[02:45:23.080 --> 02:45:26.403]  If enough people awaken from the cult spell, then we win.
[02:45:26.403 --> 02:45:31.787]  But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to an end.
[02:45:31.787 --> 02:45:33.628]  And so, we must prepare.
[02:45:33.628 --> 02:45:44.316]  Get up to a year's worth of storable foods, water filtration, survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios, and life-saving knowledge at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:45:45.697 --> 02:46:07.912]  The technocrats, the social engineers, the behavioral psychologists, they're all part of the same satanic, globalist, control freak system that seeks to play God, that seeks to turn the general population of this Earth into their slaves, into putty, into clay in their hands that they control.
[02:46:07.912 --> 02:46:15.117]  And chief amongst their physical attacks is keeping us from high quality vitamins and minerals that are essential for life on this planet.
[02:46:15.857 --> 02:46:22.138]  And so, the information we cover exposes their evil works and sabotages their globalist takeover.
[02:46:22.138 --> 02:46:25.899]  And we're having an incredible effect thanks to your support and your word of mouth.
[02:46:25.899 --> 02:46:32.380]  But it's also important to take care of our bodies themselves with high-quality water filtration at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:46:32.380 --> 02:46:42.222]  And with amazing supplements, many of which that just came back in stock, like Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, now 40% off for a limited time at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:46:42.222 --> 02:46:44.603]  So let's fight the info war, but also take care of our bodies.
[02:46:47.640 --> 02:46:57.703]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:46:57.703 --> 02:47:11.247]  So it's very important to add about this default against me, here in Austin, Texas, against Owen, and everyone out there in court, and others, is that even the Huffington Post and groups talked to lawyers that said, we don't even know this is real.
[02:47:11.247 --> 02:47:12.688]  We don't believe courts can even do this.
[02:47:12.688 --> 02:47:16.529]  This doesn't even exist, unless somebody basically just runs off and doesn't show up for court.
[02:47:17.685 --> 02:47:20.788]  So, this is real, real corruption.
[02:47:20.788 --> 02:47:25.872]  And the judge even said, I'm doing this because you criticized me and said I'm having a show trial, which she'd been doing.
[02:47:25.872 --> 02:47:29.896]  She'd been saying we'd given them no information, which isn't true!
[02:47:29.896 --> 02:47:33.479]  And she talked about a default, and I said, if that's the case, it's a show trial.
[02:47:33.479 --> 02:47:35.941]  Well, hell, it's not a show trial, it's no trial at all!
[02:47:35.941 --> 02:47:36.882]  Here they are finishing up.
[02:47:37.790 --> 02:47:52.761]  Because these are constitutional rights, rights to due process of law, rights to a trial, and rights to trial by jury, that are being stripped of someone, it can only be done under extreme and extraordinary circumstances, but the left doesn't recognize these rules.
[02:47:53.121 --> 02:47:54.041]  They don't care about them.
[02:47:54.041 --> 02:47:55.542]  They're like, we don't like you.
[02:47:55.542 --> 02:47:56.702]  You're Alex Jones.
[02:47:56.702 --> 02:48:02.904]  They carved out separate rules for Alex Jones on defamation law that they haven't applied to anyone else.
[02:48:02.904 --> 02:48:07.205]  They carved out separate rules on First Amendment law that they haven't applied to anyone else.
[02:48:07.205 --> 02:48:12.246]  They carved out separate laws on public speech outside of the courthouse that they haven't applied to anyone else.
[02:48:12.246 --> 02:48:18.828]  The court system is making a mockery of itself because it is such inflamed and political prejudice against Alex Jones.
[02:48:19.188 --> 02:48:22.952]  And who is being really judged by this process is not Alex Jones.
[02:48:22.952 --> 02:48:27.756]  It's the abhorrent lack of respect for the law by the courts themselves.
[02:48:27.756 --> 02:48:32.961]  And now, and Robert, I mean, I know why you're angry with this because this is the ultimate irony and I got to bring this up.
[02:48:32.961 --> 02:48:34.362]  Kangaroo Court from Chris Hill.
[02:48:35.183 --> 02:48:36.845]  Well, I didn't read the judgment.
[02:48:36.845 --> 02:48:37.606]  I really want to.
[02:48:37.606 --> 02:48:39.588]  And I might do a standalone on this.
[02:48:39.588 --> 02:48:50.041]  I just read a few articles where the judge apparently cited Alex Jones repeatedly saying this was a show trial, a mockery of the system to show his contempt for the process.
[02:48:50.641 --> 02:48:53.062]  And what does the judge do after all of this?
[02:48:53.062 --> 02:48:55.784]  He says, you're not even going to get a trial.
[02:48:55.784 --> 02:49:02.107]  I'm going to deem your behavior to be so bad for having called us a mockery, a show trial.
[02:49:02.107 --> 02:49:05.008]  I'm going to deem it to be so bad, I'm not going to give you a trial.
[02:49:05.008 --> 02:49:07.749]  Thus, hate him or love him.
[02:49:07.749 --> 02:49:09.330]  And I've gotten to meet him now.
[02:49:09.330 --> 02:49:09.790]  I don't hate him.
[02:49:09.790 --> 02:49:15.753]  I think he's actually, you know, he's been like a lot of people know he's been right a lot more than a broken clock.
[02:49:16.551 --> 02:49:17.912]  But love him or hate him.
[02:49:17.912 --> 02:49:19.794]  He says this is a show trial.
[02:49:19.794 --> 02:49:21.155]  And what does the judge do?
[02:49:21.155 --> 02:49:26.699]  She gets so mad at him for saying it's a show trial that she doesn't give him a day in court for the hearing on the merits.
[02:49:26.699 --> 02:49:28.160]  Default judgment.
[02:49:28.160 --> 02:49:30.462]  I mean, it's so obvious question.
[02:49:30.462 --> 02:49:33.605]  What are his remedies and what shall he be availing himself to?
[02:49:34.600 --> 02:49:38.023]  So there'll be, I mean, this is almost unprecedented.
[02:49:38.023 --> 02:49:44.868]  So like almost everything else in his cases, it's figuring out what do you do when the court system is so biased that it just won't apply the law.
[02:49:44.868 --> 02:49:48.351]  You can't trust it to enforce the law.
[02:49:48.351 --> 02:49:49.352]  That's novel.
[02:49:49.352 --> 02:49:55.877]  I mean, so I deal with that in a lot of my other cases, but because my cases are so political, that's the nature of them.
[02:49:55.877 --> 02:49:58.539]  But it's still shocking to witness.
[02:49:58.539 --> 02:50:04.024]  I mean, especially under the, again, if you have great confidence in your case, if you're the plaintiff's lawyer,
[02:50:04.797 --> 02:50:09.958]  If you're the court, if you believe that Alex Jones was wrong, let a jury say so.
[02:50:09.958 --> 02:50:13.159]  Let the evidence be fully presented.
[02:50:13.159 --> 02:50:18.360]  Why be so scared of an Austin jury, which is going to be a very liberal Democratic jury?
[02:50:18.360 --> 02:50:23.241]  It's very revelatory that all of these judges won't let him have his day in court.
[02:50:23.241 --> 02:50:28.782]  It's almost as if they know something about these cases that these cases won't hold up in the way some people think.
[02:50:29.440 --> 02:50:36.864]  But right now what happens is, so he's, you know, there's all the ways you can procedurally challenge a default judgment, so he can deal with that part of it.
[02:50:36.864 --> 02:50:46.068]  They're going to have a jury trial on damages, that's the only thing they're allowing a jury trial on, damages, in Austin in May, according to the records.
[02:50:46.688 --> 02:50:49.209]  And so he'll be defending himself on that.
[02:50:49.209 --> 02:50:52.030]  And then I think, you know, the media lied.
[02:50:52.030 --> 02:50:54.290]  Massive libel campaign by the media.
[02:50:54.290 --> 02:50:59.412]  The media went out there and told everybody, oh, there's been a substantive ruling on the merits.
[02:50:59.412 --> 02:51:01.892]  Alex Jones lost because he couldn't produce evidence.
[02:51:01.892 --> 02:51:03.113]  That's all a media lie.
[02:51:03.113 --> 02:51:08.114]  NBC, ABC, CNN, all of them are just flat out lying about Alex Jones.
[02:51:08.114 --> 02:51:11.675]  Why is it if Alex Jones is so bad, the media always has to lie about him?
[02:51:12.015 --> 02:51:15.357]  And just so everybody's clear, because I mean, I've been reading it and I'm familiar with it.
[02:51:15.357 --> 02:51:21.640]  They said he could not... The framing is he could not produce evidence to substantiate his claims.
[02:51:21.640 --> 02:51:24.021]  Let's just even assume that that were true.
[02:51:24.021 --> 02:51:26.782]  He could not produce evidence to substantiate his claims.
[02:51:26.782 --> 02:51:30.104]  That might only mean that he didn't have the evidence to substantiate them.
[02:51:30.104 --> 02:51:31.745]  It wouldn't prove the falseness.
[02:51:31.745 --> 02:51:40.189]  Even if you get to the next step, which is proving the actual falseness of the statements, you might then arguably have to deal with the criteria of actual malice because these are
[02:51:40.829 --> 02:51:41.530]  Public figures?
[02:51:41.530 --> 02:51:42.571]  What's the word?
[02:51:42.571 --> 02:51:43.912]  Spontaneous public figures?
[02:51:43.912 --> 02:51:46.374]  Well, in Texas they changed the rules on that too.
[02:51:46.374 --> 02:51:48.316]  They were pretending they were private figures.
[02:51:48.316 --> 02:51:50.197]  That they weren't public figures.
[02:51:50.197 --> 02:51:53.220]  I mean, that's why it's like every crazy rule that did come about.
[02:51:53.220 --> 02:52:00.446]  But that's why it's like if the media's interpretation was right, that he didn't have evidence to support his position, then you go to trial.
[02:52:00.446 --> 02:52:02.087]  You don't do a default judgment.
[02:52:02.087 --> 02:52:08.713]  You only go to a default judgment when you think even an Austin liberal jury will rule in Alex Jones' favor when they hear the actual facts.
[02:52:09.392 --> 02:52:13.234]  Because they would hear a very different set of facts than the media is told.
[02:52:13.234 --> 02:52:20.018]  And so they would find out things totally opposite of what the media has been telling people about the case and about him.
[02:52:20.018 --> 02:52:29.764]  And so it tells you a lot that liberals are afraid of their own jury pools in these kind of cases, that they have to rig the system to try to just shaft Alex Jones.
[02:52:29.764 --> 02:52:31.165]  Ultimately, this default judgment
[02:52:32.065 --> 02:52:44.311]  My prediction will be overturned by the Texas Supreme Court because it's such a egregious breach of the law, such a clear violation of constitutional right, and makes such a mockery.
[02:52:44.311 --> 02:52:53.835]  The Texas Supreme Court has to keep stepping in because the Austin court just can't follow the law and the Austin Texas Court of Appeals can't follow the law when it comes to political cases.
[02:52:54.535 --> 02:53:11.516]  And just so that nobody thinks Robert is being unfair because he's partial, I won't say biased, partial to Alex Jones, when Robert says it's unprecedented, you can go pull up the articles, even the counsel for the plaintiffs recognize, acknowledge, have publicly stated it's unprecedented.
[02:53:11.516 --> 02:53:12.157]  They just say,
[02:53:12.877 --> 02:53:16.079]  It's warranted under the circumstances because it's a unique set of fact pattern.
[02:53:16.079 --> 02:53:31.207]  But when you if anybody thinks this is a default judgment, meaning there had been no trial on the merits to prove the evidence that is now going to go through as a foregone fact for adjudication on damages.
[02:53:31.207 --> 02:53:32.928]  If anybody thinks that this is the new criteria,
[02:53:34.276 --> 02:53:36.717]  There's an analogy in there to something that's going on right now.
[02:53:36.717 --> 02:53:41.638]  Oh, yes, in terms of the requirements for mass vaccination based on risk of a virus.
[02:53:41.638 --> 02:53:49.959]  If that's the new criteria, you'll be getting default judgments left, right and center just based on who is politically expedient to get them against and who is not.
[02:53:49.959 --> 02:53:53.940]  It's I, you know, I hadn't followed the case in a long time.
[02:53:53.940 --> 02:53:55.861]  And when I read it, who's the judge, Robert, by the way?
[02:53:55.861 --> 02:53:57.061]  Do we know who appointed this judge?
[02:53:58.006 --> 02:54:00.730]  They're elected there at the state court level in Austin.
[02:54:00.730 --> 02:54:04.738]  In fact, all levels of courts are elected.
[02:54:04.738 --> 02:54:08.625]  The trial courts and the appellate courts are all overwhelmingly liberal Democrats.
[02:54:10.579 --> 02:54:20.568]  To me, there used to be some old school liberal Democrats that understood the importance of the rule of law, understood the perception of the fairness of our proceedings.
[02:54:20.568 --> 02:54:22.050]  These judges, in my view, do not.
[02:54:22.050 --> 02:54:23.731]  They don't respect that at all.
[02:54:23.731 --> 02:54:34.581]  But now, just to reconcile maybe something that might be incompatible here, if it's an elected judge, I mean, now that I know how people get elected at a municipal and a lower level, you know, level,
[02:54:35.237 --> 02:54:37.738]  It's not by massive amounts of votes.
[02:54:37.738 --> 02:54:56.028]  It's by a very small amount of highly involved individuals, which is why I now fully appreciate, in a cynical sense, the strategy of infiltrating these systems at the local level because it requires so little manpower to do it at a level where, you know, you can get elected or not elected by 30 votes.
[02:54:56.028 --> 02:55:03.952]  And so if you just have a lot of money to put into these things, you can really change things from the bottom up, from a cynical or Machiavellian or good perspective.
[02:55:04.472 --> 02:55:10.178]  But this judge was elected, which means in theory the constituents wanted this type of judge with these types of rulings.
[02:55:10.178 --> 02:55:11.399]  It's worse than that.
[02:55:11.399 --> 02:55:13.481]  It's what, I mean, they assume this will be popular.
[02:55:13.481 --> 02:55:14.982]  Out of 50-something judges, they gave it to her.
[02:55:14.982 --> 02:55:22.750]  This is liberal Austin that liked to pride itself originally on being creative and outside the box, that's now authoritarian Austin.
[02:55:22.750 --> 02:55:26.654]  And it's what's happened to liberal jurisdictions across really the entire Western world.
[02:55:27.225 --> 02:55:32.169]  That these are people that are, you know, Kevin Olbermann and other people just going on authoritarian rants.
[02:55:32.169 --> 02:55:40.716]  Not even, I mean, that are indistinguishable from the rants I used to see people when they attacked AIDS victims back in the 80s.
[02:55:40.716 --> 02:55:42.077]  The same kind of language.
[02:55:42.077 --> 02:55:44.579]  The same kind of just, I mean, Nazi language.
[02:55:44.579 --> 02:55:46.020]  It's what it is.
[02:55:46.020 --> 02:55:49.362]  I mean, you know, the, and so, I mean, that's what Joe Rogan pointed out.
[02:55:49.362 --> 02:55:52.525]  I mean, Rogan got into hot water because he just pointed out
[02:55:53.220 --> 02:55:58.043]  You know, when you allow this kind of breach, this is where it ends up.
[02:55:58.043 --> 02:56:04.306]  And if you don't stop it early, then before you know it, you're sliding downhill fast.
[02:56:04.306 --> 02:56:14.052]  And just so everybody knows, agree or disagree with the judge, understand the distinction imparted on anybody who repeats that statement, he was found guilty on the merits.
[02:56:14.052 --> 02:56:16.333]  This is a default judgment, which means that there was no
[02:56:17.102 --> 02:56:21.165]  There was no evidentiary hearing on the substantive aspect of the plaintiff's claim.
[02:56:21.165 --> 02:56:21.485]  That's right.
[02:56:21.485 --> 02:56:23.466]  Thank you, Viva Free.
[02:56:23.466 --> 02:56:25.747]  The rest of it is on his YouTube channel.
[02:56:25.747 --> 02:56:28.749]  You can just type in Robert Barnes or Viva Free on YouTube and find it.
[02:56:28.749 --> 02:56:30.130]  Very, very popular shows.
[02:56:30.130 --> 02:56:33.152]  Some of their stuff gets millions of views, most of them hundreds of thousands.
[02:56:33.152 --> 02:56:33.872]  Good guys.
[02:56:33.872 --> 02:56:35.133]  And what they're saying is totally true.
[02:56:35.133 --> 02:56:41.677]  I mean, I know a lot of Democrats in Austin that are actually decent people, and they didn't believe it when they saw it.
[02:56:41.677 --> 02:56:43.238]  They thought that was a joke.
[02:56:43.238 --> 02:56:46.060]  And then lawyers that have been involved are just like, what?
[02:56:47.512 --> 02:56:50.875]  You're saying we didn't, and they're like, we know you've got this and that.
[02:56:50.875 --> 02:56:53.037]  It's sort of like this game where they go, we know you've got it.
[02:56:53.037 --> 02:56:55.239]  And you're like, oh no, I don't have that.
[02:56:55.239 --> 02:56:57.041]  But see, they have to have me be the bad guy.
[02:56:57.041 --> 02:57:06.510]  They can't actually finally, after attacking me and claiming I did this to these kids or whatever, then actually have the trial where most of what they say isn't true.
[02:57:06.510 --> 02:57:07.771]  That'll make them look like fools.
[02:57:09.005 --> 02:57:14.891]  So instead, they're now gonna try to drag me in there in front of a jury, where they say, he's all guilty, just how bad is he and how much money?
[02:57:14.891 --> 02:57:17.754]  And they're already sending the stuff over here, like, how much money you got?
[02:57:17.754 --> 02:57:18.775]  We're gonna get your money.
[02:57:18.775 --> 02:57:20.256]  I mean, it's just a joke.
[02:57:20.256 --> 02:57:21.177]  So am I worried about me?
[02:57:21.177 --> 02:57:21.637]  No.
[02:57:21.637 --> 02:57:23.579]  The country's going down.
[02:57:23.579 --> 02:57:27.643]  It's like, I've got a sprained foot and the ship's sinking and on fire.
[02:57:27.643 --> 02:57:29.645]  Not worried about my sprained foot.
[02:57:29.645 --> 02:57:31.207]  The left are mad dogs.
[02:57:33.894 --> 02:57:42.842]  The engineers at BioPros are very excited to announce a major expansion of new products into the retail consumer market.
[02:57:42.842 --> 02:57:48.146]  Since their rollout of their first product almost a year ago, they've come out with four new products.
[02:57:48.146 --> 02:57:49.427]  BioDrain Pro.
[02:57:50.248 --> 02:57:55.473]  BioRV Pro, BioMarine Pro, and BioPortaPro.
[02:57:55.473 --> 02:58:09.186]  For decades, oil companies and other major chemical corporations have been using patented, naturally occurring, specially bred bacteria to eat oil spills and other toxic waste disasters.
[02:58:09.186 --> 02:58:12.590]  That's how powerful these naturally occurring microbes are.
[02:58:12.970 --> 02:58:18.376]  The BioPro system is light years better than traditional enzymes that only work once.
[02:58:18.376 --> 02:58:22.460]  These bacteria begin to breed and live in your septic tank.
[02:58:22.460 --> 02:58:27.806]  And now it's available for the general public's use for the first time on the retail market.
[02:58:27.806 --> 02:58:30.509]  Exclusively available at TheBioPros.com
[02:58:37.350 --> 02:58:46.959]  Because of the globalist reset, InfoWars listeners and viewers know a lot of our best-selling products have been sold out in some cases for up to a year.
[02:58:46.959 --> 02:58:53.806]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula with 95% Curcuminoid has been sold out for almost five months.
[02:58:53.806 --> 02:58:56.669]  Because again, the high-quality turmeric and the concentration process
[02:58:57.229 --> 02:59:03.014]  It's very, very expensive and time-consuming, and with the supply chain breakdowns and all the rest of the problems, we've been unable to get it.
[02:59:03.014 --> 02:59:06.697]  But we finally got a shipment in, and it's 40% off.
[02:59:06.697 --> 02:59:13.822]  It is the secret weapon when it comes to your immune system, when it comes to antioxidants, when it comes to your joints, when it comes to your whole body.
[02:59:13.822 --> 02:59:17.605]  People absolutely love Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[02:59:17.605 --> 02:59:20.748]  Incredible amounts of five-star reviews at InfoWarsTore.com.

[02:59:37.739 --> 02:59:40.481]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:40.481 --> 02:59:51.008]  I would stand in line for this.
[02:59:51.008 --> 02:59:53.990]  There's always room in life for this.
[02:59:54.491 --> 02:59:55.872]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:59:55.872 --> 03:00:08.138]  Final segment I'm hosting, and then Jay Dyer, one of the smartest people I know, and definitely the most up-to-date and informed on new documents and global statements, is going to take over in the next 54 minutes.
[03:00:08.138 --> 03:00:10.239]  So he takes over about five minutes for the next 54 minutes.
[03:00:11.400 --> 03:00:15.463]  And I've got a question I'm going to ask him now, because I know he's already on the Skype waiting to come on.
[03:00:15.463 --> 03:00:17.644]  We can punch him up if you want here in a moment.
[03:00:17.644 --> 03:00:20.446]  I wanted to answer this just out of my own selfishness.
[03:00:20.446 --> 03:00:24.188]  Do you think, Jay, and I know you're listening now, I'll just answer later.
[03:00:24.188 --> 03:00:25.129]  Whenever you want, the next hour.
[03:00:26.701 --> 03:00:49.290]  And it's a big question, maybe you want to come back next week on my main show and answer it, but can it be turned around once they've initiated the depopulation, once it's confirmed that this was a bioweapon, that they weren't just doing a test, they're moving forward with societal world collapse, they've now come out with a world ID, the carbon tax, they're admitting, hey we're doing this for the earth, COVID was just the excuse for the shutdown of the human system.
[03:00:50.404 --> 03:00:53.446]  Can we get their own minions to stand up and say no?
[03:00:53.446 --> 03:00:54.927]  Is there any way out of this?
[03:01:13.522 --> 03:01:28.887]  Can, even if Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and their controllers got arrested, what they've initiated now is just so psychotic, where it's admitted that they've created a bioweapon that kills 80% of humans at Wuhan, that they stole out of the Canadian lab, and that Bill Gates has control of.
[03:01:28.887 --> 03:01:30.947]  I mean, that's in the news.
[03:01:30.947 --> 03:01:33.148]  And so, like, Fauci and Gates have a gun to our head.
[03:01:34.462 --> 03:01:36.303]  And Gates is the head of the G8.
[03:01:36.303 --> 03:01:38.384]  The head of the G8 said he really is the head of the G8.
[03:01:38.384 --> 03:01:41.905]  So, we're living in a James Bond movie like Moonraker, folks.
[03:01:41.905 --> 03:01:44.266]  Real end of the world for humans as we know it stuff.
[03:01:44.266 --> 03:01:46.367]  Jay Dyer takes over in just a few minutes.
[03:01:46.367 --> 03:01:51.869]  Separately, this is a great product and they're a huge sponsor and they're selling a lot of it.
[03:01:52.429 --> 03:01:57.632]  But nothing compared to what the big oil company that scientists developed this, created this.
[03:01:57.632 --> 03:02:00.434]  The scientist is a listener and he has the patent.
[03:02:00.434 --> 03:02:07.979]  It's the famous bacteria that's natural, especially bread, that eats oil, crap, you know, anything you want taken care of.
[03:02:07.979 --> 03:02:14.282]  Old shoes, I mean, but it's safe for all the tanks, safe for all the septic systems, safe for everything.
[03:02:14.282 --> 03:02:20.746]  It's BioSeptic Pro, a 6 to 12 month supply for all of your septic tanks to kill the odor, to make it last longer.
[03:02:20.746 --> 03:02:21.307]  It's not like
[03:02:22.839 --> 03:02:23.260]  I don't know.
[03:02:32.927 --> 03:02:38.431]  We're very, very proud of it, and now they've come out with four other brands of it that I'll show you here if you're a TV viewer.
[03:02:38.431 --> 03:02:44.034]  They have it for RVs, they have it for boats, they have it for port-a-potties, and the most important one, I think, is for drains.
[03:02:44.034 --> 03:02:52.220]  You get drains clogged up, you call a plumber, it gets reclogged in the shower or wherever, you put Drano down, it doesn't work or doesn't work long enough.
[03:02:52.220 --> 03:02:54.582]  I dump this, because we're already coming out with the same powder.
[03:02:55.482 --> 03:03:00.024]  When we first got samples of it a couple of years ago before we were able to even get them to bring us to consumers.
[03:03:00.024 --> 03:03:05.906]  And I put it into my drains that were having problems, like my shower drain, never had a problem again.
[03:03:05.906 --> 03:03:07.747]  And that was over a year and a half ago.
[03:03:07.747 --> 03:03:17.171]  So, one scoop down my shower drain and then it just went in there and just lives in there and eats everything up in there, the hair and the skin particles and the soap and all the garbage.
[03:03:17.171 --> 03:03:22.053]  So, I love the BioPro's pipes and drains.
[03:03:23.206 --> 03:03:25.808]  Okay, it's all the same stuff, different packaging.
[03:03:25.808 --> 03:03:28.150]  Some has this applicator, some has that applicator.
[03:03:28.150 --> 03:03:33.453]  One application for an RV is one size, one application for a drain is another, one application for a septic tank.
[03:03:33.453 --> 03:03:37.876]  But BioDrain Pro, I think, is just your best bang for the buck.
[03:03:37.876 --> 03:03:39.237]  And you can buy any of this.
[03:03:39.237 --> 03:03:40.959]  It's all the same stuff and put it in the drain.
[03:03:40.959 --> 03:03:44.981]  This just gives the directions on that package for how you do it, so that's why it has different packaging.
[03:03:44.981 --> 03:03:52.507]  BioSeptic Pro, BioMarine Pro, BioDrain Pro, BioRV Pro, BioPortaPotty Pro, all at
[03:03:53.027 --> 03:03:55.691]  The great website, TheBiopros.com.
[03:03:55.691 --> 03:03:58.274]  TheBiopros.com.
[03:03:58.274 --> 03:03:59.015]  Just one word.
[03:03:59.015 --> 03:04:02.599]  TheBiopros.com.
[03:04:02.599 --> 03:04:06.144]  T-H-E-B-I-O-P-R-O.com.
[03:04:06.144 --> 03:04:08.086]  TheBiopros.com.
[03:04:08.627 --> 03:04:21.103]  And it's an amazing product, and I'm really proud of this, because, I mean, I went and got the guys to do it, and got the big oil company to agree, and got the contracts done, and got them to put in a smaller factory, and got it, and I put up the money to get them to go ahead and originally make the stuff.
[03:04:21.103 --> 03:04:22.544]  I mean, so you'd get it.
[03:04:22.544 --> 03:04:24.887]  I mean, they use this at industrial pig farms everywhere.
[03:04:24.887 --> 03:04:25.608]  It just eats it all up.
[03:04:27.370 --> 03:04:32.392]  They put this in lakes of pig crap and it's like, you know, they sell tons of it a day all over the world.
[03:04:32.392 --> 03:04:35.773]  But now it's available to you, the consumer.
[03:04:35.773 --> 03:04:41.954]  Infowarsstore.com is also going to be selling it soon, but now it's only available at thebiopros.com.
[03:04:41.954 --> 03:04:43.055]  Jay Dyer takes over in 60 seconds.
[03:04:45.412 --> 03:05:01.564]  I am taping this update on the morning of Tuesday, October 19th, 2021, to let all of our great radio and TV listeners know that Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula that's been sold out for a long time is back in stock with a 95% curcuminoid level.

[03:05:27.954 --> 03:05:28.274]  Oh my god.
[03:05:28.274 --> 03:05:29.474]  You think fish oil is good?
[03:05:29.474 --> 03:05:30.295]  This is amazing.
[03:05:30.295 --> 03:05:31.095]  Real oil.
[03:05:31.095 --> 03:05:32.396]  DNA Force Plus.
[03:05:32.396 --> 03:05:34.917]  I've extended that for a few more days.
[03:05:34.917 --> 03:05:36.437]  40% off back in stock.
[03:05:36.437 --> 03:05:37.198]  Amazing.

[03:05:42.500 --> 03:05:44.461]  It's all available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:05:56.587 --> 03:05:58.255]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:05:58.255 --> 03:06:00.325]  This is Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[03:06:00.325 --> 03:06:01.028]  I'm your guest host.
[03:06:02.052 --> 03:06:09.316]  And I'm going to be covering the NATO PsyOps document that you probably heard Alex mentioning this past week.
[03:06:09.316 --> 03:06:18.862]  I got a chance to read through that and wow, it fits very well with some other amazing documents that have come forth in the last couple weeks.
[03:06:18.862 --> 03:06:26.566]  That is the Human Augmentation, Dawn of a New Paradigm by the Ministry of Defense of the UK in concert with the German government.
[03:06:27.306 --> 03:06:35.454]  And these, again, these two documents really go well together in the sense of a coordinated plan, coordinated overall agenda.
[03:06:35.454 --> 03:06:39.758]  And we'll see that here as we get into the actual text.
[03:06:39.758 --> 03:06:48.065]  This is, in my view, kind of in concert with a series of PSYOPS documents that have come out over the last, I don't know, 20 or 30 years.
[03:06:48.065 --> 03:06:48.926]  We could go back to
[03:06:50.403 --> 03:06:53.085]  Famous documents like The Mind Has No Firewall.
[03:06:53.085 --> 03:06:56.428]  Now, if you've never read these, I highly recommend going and looking them up.
[03:06:56.428 --> 03:06:58.069]  They're easy to access.
[03:06:58.069 --> 03:07:08.097]  These are actually Army War College, Army PsyOps documents that have been in the public domain for many years, and most people just don't go read these things, right?
[03:07:08.097 --> 03:07:16.964]  It's kind of amazing to me because you've got journalists, so-called, out there who spend all their time basically doing PR and basically going after people, getting them to de-platform.
[03:07:17.965 --> 03:07:24.052]  And this shows that we here, InfoWars, people that do this kind of work are doing the real journalism, right?
[03:07:24.052 --> 03:07:29.539]  This is the last vestiges of journalism that's left because journalists ought to be reading these kinds of things.
[03:07:29.539 --> 03:07:30.961]  They ought to be reporting on this kind of stuff.
[03:07:32.120 --> 03:07:37.722]  Not reporting on and using their platforms as weapons to basically get rid of everybody who dissents.
[03:07:37.722 --> 03:07:41.843]  So that really they're just operatives like Winston was in 1984.
[03:07:41.843 --> 03:07:49.905]  If you remember in 1984, Winston's job is basically to revise history and to erase the memory of people that got deplatformed.
[03:07:49.905 --> 03:07:51.806]  That's really what Winston's up to in 1984.
[03:07:51.806 --> 03:07:54.106]  Go watch the movie if you haven't read the book.
[03:07:54.106 --> 03:07:56.567]  The book's a lot better, by the way.
[03:07:56.567 --> 03:08:00.508]  We're going to notice in this NATO PsyOps document, Cognitive Warfare, The Battle for Your Brain,
[03:08:01.489 --> 03:08:05.312]  That it's actually very Orwellian.
[03:08:05.312 --> 03:08:06.413]  I know that's a cliché.
[03:08:06.413 --> 03:08:08.254]  Everybody says this over and over and over.
[03:08:08.254 --> 03:08:11.377]  We hear it ad nauseum, and that's lost meaning, right?
[03:08:11.377 --> 03:08:19.703]  The notion Orwellian has lost its force, but we're going to see that as this comes to fruition, it's not going to lose its force.
[03:08:19.703 --> 03:08:21.985]  It's going to hit us square in the head.
[03:08:21.985 --> 03:08:25.647]  So, I mentioned the document, Slighting the Mind Has No Firewall.
[03:08:25.647 --> 03:08:30.491]  There's another document I recommend, Psi War to Mind War, by Michael Aquino.
[03:08:31.500 --> 03:08:40.272]  The famous Satanist who recently passed away, who wrote a key document about the US Army's psychological warfare operations.
[03:08:40.272 --> 03:08:44.257]  That doctrine of the Army's warfare was again written by a famous Satanist.
[03:08:45.592 --> 03:08:55.960]  Another text that you should know is Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars, and that deals with kind of covert warfare, non-lethal weapons, this kind of stuff.
[03:08:55.960 --> 03:09:01.564]  Silent, you know, EMF, ELF type technology, which also is mentioned, by the way, in the other documents I listed.
[03:09:01.564 --> 03:09:08.369]  So maybe in the future we'll get into those, but let's get into this NATO document which just recently leaked, and this is in concert with other
[03:09:08.969 --> 03:09:09.329]  We're good.
[03:09:30.419 --> 03:09:30.940]  We're good to go.
[03:09:53.578 --> 03:09:58.661]  Basically, pimp this out to foreign contractors to track Americans.
[03:09:58.661 --> 03:10:03.343]  Since it's illegal for Americans to track Americans, supposedly, even though they do that.
[03:10:03.343 --> 03:10:08.405]  Well, they'll just hire some foreign entity, some private entity in another country to do it.
[03:10:08.405 --> 03:10:12.467]  And all of that has come out in the last few months.
[03:10:12.467 --> 03:10:18.850]  And again, particularly related to what they call disinformation about the COOF narrative.
[03:10:19.426 --> 03:10:22.708]  Which, in other words, just means truth about what's going on, right?
[03:10:22.708 --> 03:10:33.095]  So, shut down and track the dissent from the top down via these PSYOPs officers and online SOC accounts and various techniques.
[03:10:33.095 --> 03:10:34.376]  Well, what are those techniques?
[03:10:34.376 --> 03:10:35.897]  Let's get into this NATO document.
[03:10:35.897 --> 03:10:41.401]  Western governments and the NATO military alliance are developing tactics of what are called cognitive warfare.
[03:10:41.401 --> 03:10:43.402]  We'll get into what that is here in a moment.
[03:10:43.402 --> 03:10:45.664]  Using the faux threats
[03:10:46.497 --> 03:10:52.878]  of China and Russia as the bad guy to justify waging a battle for your brain in the human domain.
[03:10:52.878 --> 03:10:58.719]  And this is ultimately, as it says in the document, to make everyone a weapon.
[03:10:58.719 --> 03:11:14.302]  And that's relevant because it reminds me of what's in the UK Transhumanist Ministry of Defense document, which says that humans are actually no longer, you know, the way we used to be described in the White Papers was as human resources, cattle, right?
[03:11:15.413 --> 03:11:21.335]  Now we are potential walking platforms, tech platforms.
[03:11:21.335 --> 03:11:37.041]  You're basically a little Wi-Fi emitter and receiver in potentia, right, to be turned into that so they can actually tune into your signals and they want to use signals, basically, signals, warfare, EMF, ELF, VLF.
[03:11:38.199 --> 03:11:46.401]  Probably the 5 and 6G material, according to Klaus, that's what it's going to be, right, to basically resonate with what's in your body.
[03:11:46.401 --> 03:11:57.783]  I suspect that that's what's going on with the various Stabbies, that what's in the Stabbies is the, you know, the graphene, the various nanotech materials, which do relate to the tracking and tracing.
[03:11:57.783 --> 03:12:04.225]  Now, they do this stupid game, play this game where they say, you can't fit a microchip into a syringe.
[03:12:04.225 --> 03:12:05.525]  There's no microchip!
[03:12:05.945 --> 03:12:06.926]  In the syringe.
[03:12:06.926 --> 03:12:08.628]  No, it's just smart blood.
[03:12:08.628 --> 03:12:19.958]  It's just a nanotech technology that is going to be tracking you and keeping up with you and taking care of your health via your blood.
[03:12:19.958 --> 03:12:25.243]  And if you missed it, by the way, this last week, I covered in depth James Bond.
[03:12:25.243 --> 03:12:29.808]  And if you recall, in Spectre, there was a specific scene in Spectre where James Bond
[03:12:30.476 --> 03:12:43.544]  He's in the underground base and he's talking to Q, and Q references the smart blood that they've injected into Bond to take care of his health, to make sure he's doing well and make sure he's in the field and he's not hurt.
[03:12:43.544 --> 03:12:47.507]  The smart blood can track and trace and tell his heart rate, etc.
[03:12:47.507 --> 03:12:55.292]  That's exactly what's in the CBS report, the 60 Minutes report from a couple months ago, where they did an interview with the people from DARPA.
[03:12:55.892 --> 03:12:58.573]  Talking about nanotech in your blood.
[03:12:58.573 --> 03:13:12.318]  That's what's in, by the way, it's going to be discussed in this NATO document, that's what's in the UK Ministry of Defense document, is that they're going to, under the guise of humans as platforms, mandate.
[03:13:12.318 --> 03:13:15.359]  The UK Ministry of Defense document says they will mandate it.
[03:13:15.359 --> 03:13:20.020]  Remember, just like all the mandates that we've heard in the last couple years, it's not law, it's just mandate.
[03:13:20.020 --> 03:13:22.161]  The government's just going to say, you've got to do this.
[03:13:22.936 --> 03:13:29.140]  It says that human platforms will be mandated to be chipped, to be tracked and traced.
[03:13:29.140 --> 03:13:31.661]  They're going to invade your biology.
[03:13:31.661 --> 03:13:33.122]  That's exactly what Klaus says.
[03:13:33.122 --> 03:13:47.270]  So look, between NATO's documents, between the PsyOps documents from 20 years ago of Michael Aquino, which talks about EMF, ELF frequencies, right, and geoengineering the atmosphere, that's actually in the footnotes of his Mind War to PsyWar.
[03:13:47.270 --> 03:13:50.431]  PsyWar to Mind War, excuse me.
[03:13:50.431 --> 03:13:51.552]  There's a coordinated plan.
[03:13:52.943 --> 03:13:57.604]  These are not disparate entities that don't know what the other arm is saying or doing.
[03:13:57.604 --> 03:14:00.865]  At this level, the plan is coordinated.
[03:14:00.865 --> 03:14:03.086]  And that's why they all say the same thing.
[03:14:03.086 --> 03:14:06.587]  And that's why they all say what the global elite of the last 50 years have said.
[03:14:06.587 --> 03:14:08.927]  The last 100 years, right?
[03:14:08.927 --> 03:14:11.228]  I've covered 50 plus of their books.
[03:14:11.228 --> 03:14:12.308]  And they all say the same thing.
[03:14:12.308 --> 03:14:18.890]  Now, they might differ on the minutia of how to get this agenda done, but the plan is the same across the board.
[03:14:19.699 --> 03:14:22.800]  And so, I get on here and I read all these documents for you.
[03:14:22.800 --> 03:14:24.761]  I'm the nerd that does your homework for you.
[03:14:24.761 --> 03:14:25.881]  I do your homework, right?
[03:14:25.881 --> 03:14:27.201]  You come to me.
[03:14:27.201 --> 03:14:30.742]  I'm the Chad nerd in class that does your homework.
[03:14:30.742 --> 03:14:34.003]  And if you don't pay me, right, you owe me.
[03:14:34.003 --> 03:14:34.543]  You owe me.
[03:14:34.543 --> 03:14:35.944]  You owe me your tater tots.
[03:14:35.944 --> 03:14:40.045]  If you don't pay me in tater tots, you're going to get beat up after recess, right?
[03:14:40.045 --> 03:14:42.866]  So, I do your homework for you, but you better pay me for doing your homework.
[03:14:44.483 --> 03:14:50.148]  And so let's take these tater tot nuggets of truth here and put them in your pocket for later on, right?
[03:14:50.148 --> 03:14:51.769]  Because you gotta know this stuff.
[03:14:51.769 --> 03:14:53.631]  You gotta know this information.
[03:14:53.631 --> 03:14:54.752]  Platform humans.
[03:14:54.752 --> 03:15:03.099]  Humans are the platforms by which psychological warfare can be conducted to make humans themselves weaponized.
[03:15:03.099 --> 03:15:07.263]  Now, this document focuses on the psychological warfare component.
[03:15:07.263 --> 03:15:10.506]  The UK document focuses on the tech side of it, right?
[03:15:10.506 --> 03:15:12.007]  The DARPA transhumanist stuff.
[03:15:12.759 --> 03:15:15.260]  But what do they want to do when they make us into platforms?
[03:15:15.260 --> 03:15:19.682]  Well, they want to change the way that we think.
[03:15:19.682 --> 03:15:23.304]  You think, OK, well, isn't that what, you know, social engineering sci-ops does?
[03:15:23.304 --> 03:15:24.265]  It changes the way we think.
[03:15:24.265 --> 03:15:25.105]  No, no.
[03:15:25.105 --> 03:15:31.868]  Changing the way you think, as this document says, by changing the brain itself.
[03:15:31.868 --> 03:15:33.029]  Exactly what Klaus says.
[03:15:33.029 --> 03:15:34.109]  We're going to get in your biology.

[03:15:39.730 --> 03:15:43.113]  Through Neuralink, through all these kinds of things which are coming.
[03:15:43.113 --> 03:15:43.873]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:15:43.873 --> 03:15:44.273]  Stay right there.
[03:15:44.273 --> 03:15:50.338]  What if you could cut your heating bills this winter with your existing wood-burning fireplace and not spend thousands doing it?

[03:16:14.380 --> 03:16:15.201]  Hey, everybody.
[03:16:15.201 --> 03:16:18.443]  Confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture?
[03:16:18.443 --> 03:16:19.203]  Me too.
[03:16:19.203 --> 03:16:26.308]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling, there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[03:16:26.308 --> 03:16:30.691]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death.
[03:16:30.691 --> 03:16:32.592]  You probably already believe that.
[03:16:32.592 --> 03:16:33.613]  I certainly do.
[03:16:33.613 --> 03:16:34.553]  So here's the thing.
[03:16:34.553 --> 03:16:42.879]  I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based substances actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.

[03:17:14.300 --> 03:17:15.522]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:17:15.522 --> 03:17:19.448]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:17:19.448 --> 03:17:20.990]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:17:20.990 --> 03:17:23.955]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:23.955 --> 03:17:29.163]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:17:29.503 --> 03:17:30.684]  I can help you too.
[03:17:30.684 --> 03:17:33.628]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:17:33.628 --> 03:17:35.850]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:17:35.850 --> 03:17:40.295]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, DanPilla.com.
[03:17:40.295 --> 03:17:41.996]  That's DanPilla.com.

[03:17:44.867 --> 03:17:54.312]  I'm typing this message on the morning of Tuesday, October 19th, 2021, and I've got some great news to report to the listeners.
[03:17:54.312 --> 03:18:05.438]  For at least one week, we're going to be able to run a sale with Bob Yee's Ultimate Turmeric Formula that just got back in stock after being sold out almost five months because of supply chain breakdowns.
[03:18:05.438 --> 03:18:09.340]  It has a 95% curcuminoid level.
[03:18:09.340 --> 03:18:12.882]  Most of the turmeric supplements have a 5 to 10% curcuminoid level.
[03:18:13.622 --> 03:18:17.004]  Our leading competitor has a 75% humanoid level.
[03:18:17.004 --> 03:18:20.026]  This is a special proprietary concentrate.
[03:18:20.026 --> 03:18:25.369]  It is so good for inflammation, for your immune system, as an antioxidant for your whole body.
[03:18:25.369 --> 03:18:26.669]  It's documented.
[03:18:26.669 --> 03:18:28.130]  It's amazing.
[03:18:28.130 --> 03:18:31.392]  Everybody knows that turmeric is an incredible thing that God created.
[03:18:31.392 --> 03:18:33.193]  And bodies is the strongest and best.
[03:18:33.193 --> 03:18:36.855]  You're gonna find, and it's back in stock, and it funds the info war.
[03:18:37.315 --> 03:18:37.976]  I'm sitting here.
[03:18:37.976 --> 03:18:40.960]  It's in the early morning hours and I'm looking at mainstream news.
[03:18:52.734 --> 03:19:07.488]  ...reporting on the fact that even the controlled revolving door FDA has come out and said that the Moderna and Pfizer shots need to be held up and not authorized for children because in studies they did on children it caused myocarditis, that's heart swelling and heart attacks.
[03:19:08.755 --> 03:19:17.841]  And then I noticed that even though this is even in the Associated Press, it's not getting any circulation, it's not on the national news, and it's very hard to even find on places like Instagram or Twitter.
[03:19:17.841 --> 03:19:18.822]  It's just crazy.
[03:19:18.822 --> 03:19:27.908]  And then, Fauci was on TV just yesterday, saying there's no damage from the vaccines, it doesn't hurt anybody, you're a conspiracy theorist if you say it.
[03:19:27.908 --> 03:19:29.269]  It's just crazy.
[03:19:29.269 --> 03:19:36.414]  And then we have all the scientists who over a year ago came out and said, these vaccines are gonna cause heart problems, and they gave the exact reasons why, and now it happened.
[03:19:37.174 --> 03:19:38.776]  That's why Infowars is on air.
[03:19:38.776 --> 03:19:42.198]  Because if we weren't on air, they'd get away with even more of this crap.
[03:19:42.198 --> 03:19:43.219]  This is just insane.
[03:19:43.219 --> 03:19:47.843]  These people are killers.
[03:19:47.843 --> 03:19:50.506]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:05.345 --> 03:20:09.809]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm your guest host Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[03:20:09.809 --> 03:20:28.565]  We're talking about the NATO psychological warfare document that has appeared online that a lot of people are making a big deal about and it should be a big deal because it's again one of a long train of psychological warfare documents that explain and demonstrate exactly how the system at a high level works, right?
[03:20:29.085 --> 03:20:36.030]  And to really understand the overall global elite plan, there's no way to do it other than to going into these documents themselves, right?
[03:20:36.030 --> 03:20:41.214]  Other than going into the writings of the elite over the last 100, 200 years.
[03:20:41.214 --> 03:20:50.000]  And in this document, this white paper, we have not so much the tech angle, although it does conclude with a lot of tech plans and DARPA plans.
[03:20:50.000 --> 03:20:54.664]  It is NATO's attitude towards cognitive warfare, the new way of doing warfare online.
[03:20:55.760 --> 03:21:07.323]  And this includes the alteration, not just of thinking processes, but the changing of the brain itself, the actual biological human being converted into a new type of being.
[03:21:08.422 --> 03:21:16.908]  It goes on to talk about our new plan, right, is to continue the notion of full-spectrum dominance and hybrid warfare.
[03:21:16.908 --> 03:21:18.769]  If you don't know what hybrid warfare is, you can go to my channel.
[03:21:18.769 --> 03:21:33.459]  I did an interview a couple of years ago with a prominent analyst named Andrew Karibko, and we did a whole interview on his book about hybrid warfare, which gives a detailed account of what this is in order to understand this NATO mindset.
[03:21:33.459 --> 03:21:37.021]  And as you go through this document, we see that this includes
[03:21:37.981 --> 03:21:55.009]  Self-declared adversaries attacking through economic warfare, attacking through cyber warfare, information warfare, and psychological warfare, and now the new added element, hacking the individual by exploiting the vulnerabilities of the human brain.
[03:21:55.009 --> 03:22:03.213]  And again, reminds me of the Mind Has No Firewall document from 20 or so years ago, which is basically saying the same types of thing from the Army War College, if I recall.
[03:22:04.961 --> 03:22:11.945]  And it says that until recently, NATO had only viewed warfare as air, land, sea, space, and cyber.
[03:22:11.945 --> 03:22:14.447]  And now the new domain is the human domain of the mind.
[03:22:14.447 --> 03:22:16.708]  Now, this doesn't mean they never knew about Infowar.
[03:22:16.708 --> 03:22:19.089]  Of course they did.
[03:22:19.089 --> 03:22:23.312]  Various governments and power blocs, they do Infowar online all the time.
[03:22:23.312 --> 03:22:25.113]  I mean, we're watching Infowars right now.
[03:22:25.113 --> 03:22:28.395]  We're participating in that from the vantage point of truth.
[03:22:28.955 --> 03:22:33.340]  And the vantage point of what is God-centered, right?
[03:22:33.340 --> 03:22:40.808]  What really ought to be the worldview, the paradigm, as opposed to tyranny, as opposed to globalism, as opposed to technocracy.
[03:22:40.808 --> 03:22:49.857]  This new form of warfare, it says, with this fifth domain, is defined by cognitive warfare, which seeks to make everyone a weapon.
[03:22:51.109 --> 03:22:55.292]  Now, why would they want to make everyone a weapon, including their domestic population?
[03:22:55.292 --> 03:22:58.554]  And it says, well, uh, I'm not joking, actually.
[03:22:58.554 --> 03:23:02.357]  It says, because you might actually be an enemy without knowing it.
[03:23:03.667 --> 03:23:08.151]  It's kind of like, you might actually be an asymptomatic carrier without knowing it.
[03:23:08.151 --> 03:23:14.476]  No one else knows this, but trust us, this gadget that we've cooked up, like Theranos, right?
[03:23:14.476 --> 03:23:19.260]  This PCR, oh, this tells you that you're carrying this, even if you don't know that, right?
[03:23:19.260 --> 03:23:21.302]  It's a scam, basically.
[03:23:21.302 --> 03:23:30.230]  And it's basically what I've said for a long time, is that all the techniques of psychological warfare manipulation out of wartime eventually get turned on the domestic population.
[03:23:30.885 --> 03:23:49.598]  When you get a degenerate corrupt elite, an oligarchy that runs your country or runs the Western world or runs what's basically coming into fruition, they take that that they used during the two world wars, all the research, all the psychological warfare, and the Cold War, and they turn it on the population domestically.
[03:23:49.598 --> 03:23:54.342]  Because it's not a battle of nation states at the highest level.
[03:23:54.342 --> 03:23:58.765]  At the highest level, it's an international elite that wants to destroy.
[03:23:59.508 --> 03:24:02.573]  Family, nation, God, all of that, right?
[03:24:02.573 --> 03:24:07.501]  All those older firewalls that would keep them from having total control.
[03:24:07.501 --> 03:24:11.327]  And in fact, this document is actually about total control.
[03:24:12.350 --> 03:24:13.851]  Mastering the human domain.
[03:24:13.851 --> 03:24:21.136]  They even referenced this later on, and if you recall, that was a Pentagon thing that was mentioned, I think, back at the time of Jade Helm, right?
[03:24:21.136 --> 03:24:28.681]  So, 10, 8, 10 years ago, when all the Jade Helm stuff was going on, you had reference to the document that came out, Mastering the Human Domain.
[03:24:28.681 --> 03:24:34.004]  If I'm going from memory, that was an Air Force document that dealt with every area of life being controlled.
[03:24:34.004 --> 03:24:35.545]  That's exactly what this is.
[03:24:35.545 --> 03:24:37.186]  So, it's basically the same thing, right?
[03:24:37.186 --> 03:24:39.507]  Cognitive warfare.
[03:24:39.507 --> 03:24:41.249]  So, the brain is the battlefield of the 21st century.
[03:24:42.429 --> 03:24:53.219]  Humans are the contested domain and future conflicts will likely occur amongst people digitally first and physically thereafter in proximity to the hubs of political and economic power.
[03:24:53.219 --> 03:24:58.484]  The vulnerability is precisely the human mind.
[03:24:58.484 --> 03:25:00.086]  So how is the human mind vulnerable?
[03:25:01.463 --> 03:25:12.574]  It says that what has to happen here is that we're going to have to weaponize cognitive warfare to the extent that we don't just go after or target individuals in the sense of those who might pose a threat.
[03:25:12.574 --> 03:25:13.816]  And who poses the threat?
[03:25:13.816 --> 03:25:16.819]  Well, it's their determination and it's anybody who might be
[03:25:17.499 --> 03:25:21.602]  Unknowingly susceptible to foreign disinformation.
[03:25:21.602 --> 03:25:25.043]  So, they're just going to say, well, we've determined you're a Russian bot.
[03:25:25.043 --> 03:25:27.585]  Oh, we've determined that you are a foreign asset.
[03:25:27.585 --> 03:25:28.545]  Well, what's the evidence?
[03:25:28.545 --> 03:25:31.347]  Well, because you're saying true things, right?
[03:25:31.347 --> 03:25:33.808]  We saw this basically in the last four years.
[03:25:33.808 --> 03:25:34.689]  Remember the Russiagate?
[03:25:34.689 --> 03:25:37.651]  The whole Russiagate thing is basically an example of this, right?
[03:25:37.651 --> 03:25:45.355]  Well, there's not actually evidence that you're a foreign agent, but we're just going to say that you are because you're saying things that are true and damage the existing power structure.
[03:25:46.627 --> 03:25:51.169]  And they said that we're going to have to weaponize social sciences along with academics.
[03:25:51.169 --> 03:25:57.171]  How long have I been telling you that the key enemy, the worst human beings in America, are the academics?
[03:25:57.171 --> 03:26:06.015]  Because they are the ones that foster, as the so-called intellectual class, all the baloney upon the last few generations of your offspring.
[03:26:06.015 --> 03:26:11.878]  When you send your offspring to these state universities, they're there to be brainwashed by these neoliberal Marxists.
[03:26:11.878 --> 03:26:12.798]  I know that doesn't make sense.
[03:26:12.798 --> 03:26:14.379]  How can you have a neoliberal Marxist?
[03:26:14.379 --> 03:26:15.159]  But that's what they are.
[03:26:15.911 --> 03:26:17.732]  They're Marxist professors.
[03:26:17.732 --> 03:26:19.953]  I've dealt with them for 10 years.
[03:26:19.953 --> 03:26:27.076]  They are the worst people out there, and that's who is out there fomenting their change agents, right?
[03:26:27.076 --> 03:26:29.697]  You've heard this terminology.
[03:26:29.697 --> 03:26:36.680]  And some of them are dumb enough to believe Marxism, and some of them don't even believe it, or don't believe the socialism, the collectivism, whatever they're promoting.
[03:26:36.680 --> 03:26:39.781]  And some of them are also so-called right-wing libertarians.
[03:26:39.781 --> 03:26:42.002]  So, I'm not just going after so-called communists.
[03:26:43.064 --> 03:26:48.367]  The intellectual class is just bereft of any virtue.
[03:26:48.367 --> 03:26:54.611]  They're all basically there to destroy the existing structure, implode from within.
[03:26:54.611 --> 03:27:00.255]  And this document is actually saying we're going to have to work with weaponized academia.
[03:27:00.255 --> 03:27:03.417]  I mean, they've already weaponized academia for decades, right?
[03:27:03.417 --> 03:27:08.180]  I mean, it was the OSS that actually brought over the Frankfurt School of Critical Theorists.
[03:27:08.180 --> 03:27:11.382]  I mean, this is Foreign Affairs magazine, but there's books written on this.
[03:27:11.382 --> 03:27:11.862]  It's well known.
[03:27:12.725 --> 03:27:13.065]  Right?
[03:27:13.065 --> 03:27:21.187]  And Bertrand Russell, Rockefeller Foundation, they are the ones that said, let's bring the Marxist critical theorists over to the West to weaponize academia.
[03:27:21.187 --> 03:27:23.487]  So this is not new, this has been going on for a long time.
[03:27:23.487 --> 03:27:31.409]  We also, it says, must weaponize human sciences to develop this cognitive warfare capacity.
[03:27:31.409 --> 03:27:35.190]  This results in what they call the militarization of brain science.
[03:27:35.190 --> 03:27:39.991]  Thus, NATO's development of cognitive warfare leads to the militarization of every area of society
[03:27:41.875 --> 03:27:45.758]  The mastering of the human domain, which includes the human mind.
[03:27:45.758 --> 03:27:53.402]  Then it goes on to say that if anyone disagrees with this, you just say that they are part of a fifth column and that they're foreign agents.
[03:27:53.402 --> 03:27:54.203]  It doesn't matter if it's true.
[03:27:54.203 --> 03:27:54.883]  Just say it.
[03:27:54.883 --> 03:27:57.385]  Just say, oh, are you saying anything true?
[03:27:57.385 --> 03:27:58.505]  Oh, you must be a foreign asset.
[03:27:58.505 --> 03:27:59.226]  You must be a foreign agent.
[03:28:01.398 --> 03:28:07.019]  And this is, again, part of the hybrid warfare document, which is a technology of social engineering, social control.
[03:28:07.019 --> 03:28:20.923]  And they actually give, one of the examples that's given here is the Canadian military working with NATO to use psychological warfare to scare the crap out of the Canadian civilians in the last COVID pandemic nonsense.
[03:28:20.923 --> 03:28:22.703]  That was all just hyped up.
[03:28:22.703 --> 03:28:24.664]  And we've been, again, Alex was talking about this all week.
[03:28:25.387 --> 03:28:30.191]  And this document is basically pointing out that this is a Canadian psychological warfare operation.
[03:28:30.191 --> 03:28:35.535]  And this plan of cognitive warfare is what they were doing, what was going on there.
[03:28:35.535 --> 03:28:39.458]  So this is, when you see the media rolling out their lies, it's this.
[03:28:39.458 --> 03:28:41.419]  It's cognitive warfare.
[03:28:41.419 --> 03:28:42.180]  This is Jay Dyer.
[03:28:42.180 --> 03:28:42.740]  This is Alex Jones.
[03:28:42.740 --> 03:28:43.360]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:28:43.360 --> 03:28:43.781]  Stay where you are.
[03:28:44.366 --> 03:28:58.217]  You know, listeners call into the show and they thank me, and it makes me feel pathetic, because I sit there and I beg you for support, constantly, for prayer, for financial support, and for word of mouth, and we're all in this together.
[03:28:58.217 --> 03:29:03.561]  And it gets old having to come to you and say, hey, I got great products, please buy them or we won't be here on air.
[03:29:03.561 --> 03:29:04.262]  But it's true.
[03:29:04.262 --> 03:29:07.665]  We're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level.
[03:29:08.405 --> 03:29:10.888]  That is not beholden to the big corporate sponsors.
[03:29:10.888 --> 03:29:12.950]  And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else.
[03:29:12.950 --> 03:29:14.732]  They've crippled all the other groups.
[03:29:14.732 --> 03:29:15.593]  And we're still here.
[03:29:15.593 --> 03:29:20.017]  And as this whole new world order comes out in the open, our credibility is going up.
[03:29:20.017 --> 03:29:21.639]  That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[03:29:21.639 --> 03:29:23.781]  That's why America has got to be taken down.
[03:29:23.781 --> 03:29:27.586]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved and America still quasi-free.
[03:29:28.106 --> 03:29:29.727]  If you only knew the power of the dark side.
[03:29:52.170 --> 03:29:59.100]  Join Bill Gates and together we will defeat humanity.
[03:29:59.100 --> 03:30:05.088]  Then our gods will reward us with eternal life.
[03:30:05.088 --> 03:30:07.952]  That's basically the ethos of the globalists.
[03:30:09.662 --> 03:30:11.003]  They must first play God.
[03:30:11.003 --> 03:30:17.449]  They must first prove that they are the fittest in their social Darwinistic system.
[03:30:17.449 --> 03:30:18.870]  And in a way, they're right.
[03:30:18.870 --> 03:30:26.577]  If we let them lie to us and dumb us down and poison us and destroy our children's futures, the evidence is overwhelming and out in the open.
[03:30:26.577 --> 03:30:30.280]  We really deserve what's happened to us.
[03:30:30.280 --> 03:30:31.141]  So I ask you now.
[03:30:32.259 --> 03:30:36.123]  Are you going to step up and expose the new old order even more?
[03:30:36.123 --> 03:30:40.428]  I know I'm pledging to step up and redouble my efforts.
[03:30:40.428 --> 03:30:42.550]  The front lines of the fight is InfoWars.com
[03:30:44.406 --> 03:30:49.267]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalists.
[03:30:49.267 --> 03:30:51.308]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[03:30:51.308 --> 03:30:56.789]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[03:30:56.789 --> 03:30:57.890]  But we failed.
[03:30:57.890 --> 03:30:59.550]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[03:30:59.550 --> 03:31:01.410]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat-footed.
[03:31:01.410 --> 03:31:06.392]  But they are going ahead with their full operational de-industrialization Great Reset.
[03:31:07.432 --> 03:31:16.356]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show, because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[03:31:16.356 --> 03:31:21.538]  So we've got to information warfare the enemy and try to stop their agenda, but we've also got to get personally prepared.
[03:31:21.538 --> 03:31:24.460]  And one of the number one things to do is high-quality, storable food.
[03:31:24.460 --> 03:31:29.222]  We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarestore.com.
[03:31:29.222 --> 03:31:34.364]  So whether it's a month or a six-month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready to ship right now.
[03:31:34.764 --> 03:31:39.676]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines in wait.
[03:31:39.676 --> 03:31:42.021]  Because believe me, serious times are coming.
[03:31:42.021 --> 03:31:43.905]  Get ready at infowarestore.com.
[03:31:45.219 --> 03:32:07.434]  The technocrats, the social engineers, the behavioral psychologists, they're all part of the same satanic, globalist, control freak system that seeks to play God, that seeks to turn the general population of this Earth into their slaves, into putty, into clay in their hands that they control.
[03:32:07.434 --> 03:32:14.639]  And chief amongst their physical attacks is keeping us from high quality vitamins and minerals that are essential for life on this planet.
[03:32:15.379 --> 03:32:21.661]  And so, the information we cover exposes their evil works and sabotages their globalist takeover.
[03:32:21.661 --> 03:32:25.422]  And we're having an incredible effect thanks to your support and your word of mouth.
[03:32:25.422 --> 03:32:31.904]  But it's also important to take care of our bodies themselves with high-quality water filtration at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:32:31.904 --> 03:32:41.747]  And with amazing supplements, many of which that just came back into stock, like Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, now 40% off for a limited time at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:32:41.747 --> 03:32:44.128]  So let's fight the info war, but also take care of our bodies.
[03:32:47.344 --> 03:32:52.825]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:32:52.825 --> 03:33:05.987]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:05.987 --> 03:33:10.388]  I'm your guest host Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis and we're getting into the NATO PsyOps document.
[03:33:10.388 --> 03:33:14.749]  We're dissecting it point by point and we just covered the section where it mentions the
[03:33:16.593 --> 03:33:28.096]  Parallel and cooperative operations with the Canadian military and using these kinds of techniques to scare the Canadian citizenship into the stabbies.
[03:33:28.096 --> 03:33:39.678]  In fact, it even mentions the challenges and the risk, the rewards, the, the, uh, if you come get a, uh, stabby, we'll give you cash, this kind of stuff.
[03:33:39.678 --> 03:33:43.699]  These were ideas that were invented, uh, in this psyops, uh,
[03:33:44.412 --> 03:33:55.618]  Kudri, as we move on, it talks about the fact that what really has to be changed here is not just the human mind, but human action by changing the human brain.
[03:33:55.618 --> 03:34:03.762]  It says that we're going to have to use cognitive warfare and other techniques such as cognitive infiltration to sow dissonance
[03:34:04.580 --> 03:34:08.565]  To instigate conflicts, polarize opinions, and radicalize.
[03:34:08.565 --> 03:34:15.455]  Now, if you remember Cass Sunstein wrote a paper many years ago about cognitive infiltration.
[03:34:15.455 --> 03:34:19.099]  I actually read that whole paper and oddly enough it was a philosophy paper.
[03:34:19.680 --> 03:34:36.097]  That's kind of my field, so I didn't expect it to be what it was, and he basically just goes into how philosophy and the worldview warfare that philosophy can teach psyops is crucial to understanding how to disrupt all of the truth movements.
[03:34:36.097 --> 03:34:42.884]  And one of the things he said would be key was to infiltrate, polarize, and come up with fake conspiracies.
[03:34:43.607 --> 03:34:48.048]  And this is a technique that we've seen the system using for decades, disinformation.
[03:34:48.048 --> 03:34:57.971]  And now we even see the late night TV shows where they even come on and say that disinformation is what all of the people who put out truth are, right?
[03:34:57.971 --> 03:35:06.854]  The comedy so-called hosts that are making fun of Alex talking about COVID and ivermectin and all that, that's all disinformation.
[03:35:06.854 --> 03:35:12.556]  So what they typically do is just gaslight and just lie and just continue to lie.
[03:35:14.151 --> 03:35:18.773]  So much so that people are just disoriented and they can no longer tell truth from falsehood.
[03:35:18.773 --> 03:35:25.795]  The whole society then becomes based on lies and that's actually a powerful technique of psychological warfare.
[03:35:25.795 --> 03:35:34.678]  So it goes on to say that by disrupting and infiltrating all of the groups that oppose NATO's, which is a criminal organization basically.
[03:35:34.678 --> 03:35:40.179]  So basically anyone who disagrees with NATO is disinformation, right?
[03:35:40.179 --> 03:35:41.540]  Which is ridiculous because
[03:35:42.393 --> 03:35:56.436]  You have to wonder, do all the people who participate in this, you've got all these people on here, like these military people that are sitting around in this Zoom call, participating in this discussion and panel, do they actually believe this?
[03:35:56.436 --> 03:36:04.477]  How do people think that what they're promoting is going to benefit them, right?
[03:36:04.477 --> 03:36:07.918]  I mean, these people, many of them, not all of them, but many of them have children, right?
[03:36:07.918 --> 03:36:09.558]  Now, we know the upper crust of the
[03:36:10.545 --> 03:36:12.626]  Initiates the inner party at the top.
[03:36:12.626 --> 03:36:14.727]  They don't have children and they don't want children, right?
[03:36:14.727 --> 03:36:20.069]  But the people who are the engines and fosterers of this system, many of them have children.
[03:36:20.069 --> 03:36:26.932]  And I just don't understand if, like, do they think that their children are actually going to be exempted from mandatory chipping?
[03:36:26.932 --> 03:36:31.354]  I mean, the UK transhumanist document says everybody's going to be chipped.
[03:36:31.354 --> 03:36:36.896]  Everyone will have their biology invaded to become synthetic silicon-based life forms.
[03:36:37.518 --> 03:36:38.819]  I'm not joking, that's what it says.
[03:36:38.819 --> 03:36:44.342]  Now, you could debate whether you think that's going to actually happen or how far they're going to get with that, but that's their plan.
[03:36:44.342 --> 03:36:49.565]  And it's a Bond villain, maniacal mad scientist level crazy plan.
[03:36:49.565 --> 03:36:54.047]  It's pinky in the brain level shit, right?
[03:36:54.047 --> 03:37:04.253]  So, as we get through this document, it goes on to say that the cognitive warfare, this new domain, it deals with ways to actually harm the brain itself.
[03:37:04.253 --> 03:37:06.674]  So, it goes beyond just the notion of
[03:37:08.662 --> 03:37:11.284]  Again, influencing and changing your thought processes.
[03:37:11.284 --> 03:37:15.607]  It's the actual physical brain itself and the neurons that have to be altered and changed.
[03:37:15.607 --> 03:37:27.816]  He goes on to say that the in-house think tank of NATO's research here, one of the hottest topics, which is, by the way, situated in the U.S.
[03:37:27.816 --> 03:37:30.478]  So, this is not a Canadian thing or Euro thing.
[03:37:30.478 --> 03:37:33.721]  This is actually all in-house at U.S.
[03:37:33.721 --> 03:37:34.481]  military bases.
[03:37:34.481 --> 03:37:36.583]  It says that this cognitive warfare
[03:37:37.273 --> 03:37:46.978]  must first of all focus on information war and changing the brain ultimately not just through the information that comes in but the alteration of the brain itself.
[03:37:46.978 --> 03:37:55.243]  It goes on to say that cognitive warfare involves the alteration of the brain through nanotechnology.
[03:37:55.243 --> 03:37:59.045]  So actually nanotech it says is going to be key to
[03:38:00.382 --> 03:38:20.203]  The art of using technology to alter the human targets themselves, and this includes nanotech, biotech, infotech, and all the machinations of cognitive science to alter the very brain itself so that the thought processes are altered so that humans don't probably do things like critical thinking, right?
[03:38:20.203 --> 03:38:21.364]  I mean, that's what
[03:38:22.245 --> 03:38:23.746]  Presumably, they're talking about here, right?
[03:38:23.746 --> 03:38:25.347]  They don't want people who are critically thinking.
[03:38:25.347 --> 03:38:31.569]  They want people who are just drones that basically emit the signal that the system puts out.
[03:38:31.569 --> 03:38:34.931]  And I was just reminded of that movie, Cell, right?
[03:38:34.931 --> 03:38:37.232]  If you've seen this, you'll know what I'm talking about.
[03:38:37.232 --> 03:38:38.993]  If you haven't seen it, I recommend going and watching it.
[03:38:38.993 --> 03:38:43.335]  It's a Stephen King story that they made into a movie in 2016.
[03:38:43.335 --> 03:38:46.256]  It's got Samuel L. Jackson and John Cusack.
[03:38:46.256 --> 03:38:48.097]  Look at the big brains on Brad, right?
[03:38:49.174 --> 03:38:54.378]  2016 cell, not the old 2002 or 2003 cell with J. Lo and Vince Vaughn.
[03:38:54.378 --> 03:38:55.738]  That's also a Stephen King story.
[03:38:55.738 --> 03:39:10.488]  But this one is about the fact that people are being mutated into becoming cell receptors and that the cell signals, kind of like Kingsman, if you saw the Kingsman, similar type of plot, right?
[03:39:10.488 --> 03:39:12.249]  In this one, it's this basically
[03:39:13.192 --> 03:39:20.938]  Cellular signal that's that's emitted to influence people's brain patterns and brain signals and people just start losing it, right?
[03:39:20.938 --> 03:39:22.660]  They start going crazy.
[03:39:22.660 --> 03:39:37.912]  And as you can imagine, it's a sort of, you know, dystopian walking dead apocalypse type type story, but it's relevant because that's kind of what's in all of these documents is what what's what what they're talking about with altering people through the signals again.
[03:39:37.912 --> 03:39:40.594]  Interesting that Samuel Jackson was in Kingsman.
[03:39:41.114 --> 03:39:42.536]  Which is basically the same plot, right?
[03:39:42.536 --> 03:39:56.148]  If you remember in Kingsman, he's the maniacal Malthusian villain who wants to use the Sim cards and the cell signals to disrupt and turn everybody into zombies and then basically depopulate and he's got to break away civilization.
[03:39:56.648 --> 03:39:57.369]  Right?
[03:39:57.369 --> 03:40:24.948]  If you want to go deeper into that breakaway civilization, I just did a three-hour talk on my YouTube channel where I got into the actual white papers and documents, report from Iron Mountain, Continuity of Government, all these RAN Corporation things that actually do discuss the possibility of a breakaway civilization of the elite, which we see in Moonraker, which we see in movies like Sky Captain of the World of Tomorrow, where a Malthusian villain wants to depopulate and reseed the planet with his offspring.
[03:40:27.282 --> 03:40:29.944]  I mean, this is not Bond.
[03:40:29.944 --> 03:40:41.712]  I mean, I remember because Alex would always talk about the in the 90s, in the 80s and 90s, there was these old documents that would mention the possibility of the Matrix and this kind of stuff.
[03:40:41.712 --> 03:40:42.993]  So I went and found those documents.
[03:40:42.993 --> 03:40:44.374]  I put I put them in my first book.
[03:40:45.436 --> 03:40:52.238]  And I found another one, too, where back in the 90s they were talking about the implantation of microchips.
[03:40:52.238 --> 03:41:05.661]  I think it's an Air Force document in the 90s that talks about how the future of warfare will involve what they were experimenting with at that time in the 90s of microchips relaying to satellites, relaying to ground-based computers.
[03:41:05.661 --> 03:41:07.262]  So, basically, eye in the sky,
[03:41:07.802 --> 03:41:08.603]  We're good to go.
[03:41:27.353 --> 03:41:35.416]  About how they roll out the warfare, the tech from Vietnam 20, 30 years later, which was pioneering drone stuff, right?
[03:41:35.416 --> 03:41:43.920]  Vietnam was the first to use UAV, unarmed, to unmanned aerial vehicles and drones.
[03:41:43.920 --> 03:41:45.321]  That was first done in Vietnam.
[03:41:45.321 --> 03:41:50.063]  This is covered in Annie Jacobson's DARPA book, the whole history of DARPA, right?
[03:41:50.063 --> 03:41:55.705]  Everything that's in this document is really what DARPA has rolled out as the R&D arm of the Deep State.
[03:41:56.354 --> 03:42:01.017]  I mean, the very Internet that we're using right now, that's DARPA and ARPANET.
[03:42:01.017 --> 03:42:02.157]  That's what that is, right?
[03:42:02.157 --> 03:42:11.483]  It was a wartime cryptography NSA Cold War era information relay that they rolled out on the public.
[03:42:11.483 --> 03:42:13.264]  I mean, the Internet has a lot of good things.
[03:42:13.264 --> 03:42:14.185]  I'm not saying it's bad.
[03:42:14.185 --> 03:42:15.005]  We're all on the Internet.
[03:42:15.005 --> 03:42:15.725]  We're all using it.
[03:42:15.725 --> 03:42:20.008]  But remember that it comes out of military psyops and wartime.
[03:42:21.531 --> 03:42:33.801]  And so it says notes in this document it says we're going to have to change the way people think to make sure that they don't basically they don't think it's not what we think but change the way we think this reminds me of the recent
[03:42:34.458 --> 03:42:35.199]  Articles.
[03:42:35.199 --> 03:42:37.121]  Don't do your own research.
[03:42:37.121 --> 03:42:38.523]  Don't go and study on your own.
[03:42:38.523 --> 03:42:40.766]  Don't go down the rabbit hole, the New York Times said.
[03:42:40.766 --> 03:42:42.908]  It's basically echoing this, right?
[03:42:42.908 --> 03:42:44.029]  Don't go anywhere, we'll be right back.
[03:42:44.029 --> 03:42:49.095]  I'm here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021, and I just want to say something.
[03:42:49.095 --> 03:42:51.558]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew.
[03:42:52.419 --> 03:42:58.942]  That has come together over the years and is truly an answer to prayer, and I am so blessed and thankful for all of you, the listeners of this show.
[03:42:58.942 --> 03:43:01.683]  I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you.
[03:43:01.683 --> 03:43:06.245]  Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter, you've got red blood.
[03:43:06.245 --> 03:43:16.730]  And if you love freedom and justice, and if you love our innocent children, then we are brothers and sisters together, and it has just been an incredible experience to work with you over the years.
[03:43:16.730 --> 03:43:19.652]  And as crazy as things are, I want to keep working into the future.
[03:43:20.552 --> 03:43:23.474]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[03:43:23.474 --> 03:43:28.357]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[03:43:28.357 --> 03:43:30.999]  Again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[03:43:30.999 --> 03:43:35.402]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done.
[03:43:35.402 --> 03:43:39.504]  And just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you.
[03:43:39.504 --> 03:43:42.466]  And hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support him for us.
[03:43:42.466 --> 03:43:42.847]  God bless.
[03:43:43.857 --> 03:43:47.678]  Back in stock, down-and-out liquid sleep support.
[03:43:47.678 --> 03:43:49.039]  It's been out of stock for a while.
[03:43:49.039 --> 03:43:52.820]  It's one of three sleep aids we have at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:43:52.820 --> 03:43:54.021]  This one has been very popular.
[03:43:54.021 --> 03:43:55.201]  It's sold off the shelves.
[03:43:55.201 --> 03:43:59.083]  It's back in stock, down-and-out liquid sleep support.
[03:43:59.083 --> 03:44:04.925]  This is probably the strongest sleep aid that we have, I would say.
[03:44:04.925 --> 03:44:07.846]  Knockout, RocketRest, both great.
[03:44:07.846 --> 03:44:09.247]  Comes in pill form.
[03:44:09.247 --> 03:44:12.728]  This is the liquid tincture, and I think this is probably the most powerful one.
[03:44:13.248 --> 03:44:15.248]  Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine.
[03:44:15.248 --> 03:44:21.150]  This is, if you haven't done an iodine challenge yet, if you haven't done the iodine challenge, what are you waiting for?
[03:44:21.150 --> 03:44:22.170]  Now is the time.
[03:44:22.170 --> 03:44:24.750]  Super Male and Super Female Vitality.
[03:44:24.750 --> 03:44:28.871]  Living Defense Plus and the Organic Greens Fiber Caps.
[03:44:28.871 --> 03:44:33.792]  We have a limited supply of these right now, but we want to sell them all out so we can order a new batch.
[03:44:33.792 --> 03:44:34.812]  It was very popular.
[03:44:34.812 --> 03:44:38.133]  The Organic Greens Fiber Caps, but we have all kinds of other great supplements.
[03:44:38.473 --> 03:44:41.218]  That are great for so many different things.
[03:44:41.218 --> 03:44:46.867]  Take advantage of those.
[03:44:46.867 --> 03:44:50.273]  What are champions made of?
[03:44:50.273 --> 03:44:51.415]  Here's a man who can show you.
[03:44:57.912 --> 03:44:59.493]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, is the InfoWars store hotline.

[03:45:01.414 --> 03:45:02.715]  AAA-253-3139, is the InfoWars store hotline.

[03:45:27.629 --> 03:45:30.671]  InfoWarsStore.com beats out all the rest.

[03:46:25.051 --> 03:46:26.452]  Krill Oil is selling out fast.

[03:46:28.013 --> 03:46:28.474]  Oh my god.
[03:46:28.474 --> 03:46:29.735]  You think fish oil is good?
[03:46:29.735 --> 03:46:30.555]  This is amazing.
[03:46:30.555 --> 03:46:31.356]  Real oil.
[03:46:31.356 --> 03:46:32.637]  DNA Force Plus.
[03:46:32.637 --> 03:46:34.579]  I've extended that for a few more days.
[03:46:34.579 --> 03:46:36.701]  40% off back in stock.
[03:46:36.701 --> 03:46:37.442]  Amazing.
[03:46:37.442 --> 03:46:39.003]  Down and out.
[03:46:39.003 --> 03:46:39.744]  50% off.
[03:46:39.744 --> 03:46:42.766]  It's got eight different natural compounds for deeper, cleaner sleep.
[03:46:42.766 --> 03:46:48.251]  It's all available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:46:48.251 --> 03:46:50.894]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:08.359 --> 03:47:09.801]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:09.801 --> 03:47:11.082]  This is your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[03:47:11.082 --> 03:47:19.991]  I just want to remind you to go to the InfoWars store and support this spearhead of the Liberty Movement.
[03:47:19.991 --> 03:47:21.713]  Support this true
[03:47:22.572 --> 03:47:45.019]  Remnant of journalism and media here with Alex and you know Alex has done so much over the years to wake people up and we definitely want and this is a crucial time for InfoWars to be here for Alex to be here because it's at that tipping point where we really could continue to just explode and have mega mega mega mass awakening we're already starting to see a mass awakening so go to the InfoWars store
[03:47:45.819 --> 03:47:46.580]  Get those products.
[03:47:46.580 --> 03:47:51.624]  I see a lot of soy out there in terms of the male region.
[03:47:51.624 --> 03:47:54.806]  A lot of soy boys that have lost mojo.
[03:47:54.806 --> 03:48:00.391]  You know, you got to have mojo to get, you know, a mate and to have offspring.
[03:48:00.391 --> 03:48:04.274]  And a big part of the Global Elite plan is no offspring.
[03:48:04.274 --> 03:48:05.675]  No offspring for you.
[03:48:05.675 --> 03:48:06.856]  No, no.
[03:48:06.856 --> 03:48:07.857]  You have to be sterile.
[03:48:07.857 --> 03:48:13.341]  You have to go live in a coom pod, basically, where you just watch VR porn all day, right?
[03:48:14.022 --> 03:48:14.943]  No, we don't want to do that.
[03:48:14.943 --> 03:48:16.845]  We want to be actual men.
[03:48:16.845 --> 03:48:19.648]  We want to have, you know, edgy masculinity.
[03:48:19.648 --> 03:48:20.889]  We don't want to be soy males.
[03:48:20.889 --> 03:48:25.334]  So, a lot of the products in the InfoWare store can help you with that.
[03:48:25.334 --> 03:48:27.296]  And I want to encourage you to go there.
[03:48:27.296 --> 03:48:28.738]  Yes, we don't want to be that dude.
[03:48:28.738 --> 03:48:31.981]  There's too many of that dude out there.
[03:48:31.981 --> 03:48:33.022]  Now, I was getting into the
[03:48:34.165 --> 03:48:42.467]  Movies and themes of the Breakaway Civilization, the Malthusian plan of Moonraker and Skycaptain of the World of Tomorrow, and all these various movies.
[03:48:42.467 --> 03:48:44.608]  There's so many movies that have this plot, right?
[03:48:44.608 --> 03:48:49.389]  So many novels, so many stories, so many TV shows that you can't really list them.
[03:48:49.389 --> 03:48:50.610]  I actually did list them, by the way.
[03:48:50.610 --> 03:49:02.593]  If you go to my YouTube channel, you can watch that recent video talk that I did yesterday, a couple days ago, on the Breakaway Civilization, the Psy-Op plan, and how they want to have this Project Noah.
[03:49:03.089 --> 03:49:06.854]  But basically to the elite will go off somewhere else and you think, oh, that's crazy.
[03:49:06.854 --> 03:49:08.076]  That's just fiction.
[03:49:08.076 --> 03:49:08.416]  Really?
[03:49:08.416 --> 03:49:15.246]  Did you see what MIT Bill Gates and Jeffrey Epstein had planned where that was actually the plan was to.
[03:49:16.247 --> 03:49:21.510]  Experiment with re-seeding and having basically their own harem of a future race.
[03:49:21.510 --> 03:49:22.091]  I'm not joking.
[03:49:22.091 --> 03:49:22.671]  That sounds crazy.
[03:49:22.671 --> 03:49:23.732]  That was in the New York Times.
[03:49:23.732 --> 03:49:29.475]  That was an Epstein plan was to try to do something Hugo Drax level like that.
[03:49:29.475 --> 03:49:35.499]  And as you know, last week we covered No Time to Die in depth, where I went into the history of Ian Fleming.
[03:49:35.499 --> 03:49:38.520]  I went into all of his psyops and wartime operations.
[03:49:38.520 --> 03:49:41.822]  And wouldn't you know, what was Ian Fleming?
[03:49:41.822 --> 03:49:44.204]  A high-level... Oh, psyops!
[03:49:44.204 --> 03:49:44.644]  Exactly.
[03:49:45.419 --> 03:49:48.283]  Exactly what we're looking at today.
[03:49:48.283 --> 03:49:53.750]  And if we just have basic, it's not like we have to get a PhD in psyops to decode this stuff.
[03:49:53.750 --> 03:50:00.639]  I mean, if we just have basic critical thinking, if we know basic logical fallacies, we're not going to fall into being duped by this nonsense, right?
[03:50:00.639 --> 03:50:03.282]  We're not going to fall into the idea of
[03:50:04.011 --> 03:50:07.332]  Going and getting a stabby to get a free doughnut, right?
[03:50:07.332 --> 03:50:08.893]  I mean, that's what we're talking about.
[03:50:08.893 --> 03:50:12.234]  This is the kind of BS they come up with, is these lame sales pitches.
[03:50:12.234 --> 03:50:15.815]  Well, maybe if we give everybody doughnuts, they'll go get booster shots.
[03:50:15.815 --> 03:50:17.215]  And it worked amazingly.
[03:50:17.215 --> 03:50:22.737]  I can't imagine being that stupid as to go get an experimental vaccine.
[03:50:22.737 --> 03:50:24.058]  It's not a vaccine.
[03:50:24.058 --> 03:50:25.818]  Gene therapy for a freaking doughnut.
[03:50:25.818 --> 03:50:27.119]  And those doughnuts aren't even any good.
[03:50:30.146 --> 03:50:40.137]  So it goes on to say that what I think the document is talking about with the alteration of the brain is actually the chemicals, the biowarfare, etc.
[03:50:40.137 --> 03:50:42.900]  that will alter the brain processes, right?
[03:50:42.900 --> 03:50:43.941]  I mean, everybody knows that
[03:50:44.835 --> 03:50:47.677]  Chemicals can basically damage your brain, right?
[03:50:47.677 --> 03:50:53.360]  You can become a slow boy, basically, if you're exposed to mercury or any of these other toxic chemicals, right?
[03:50:53.360 --> 03:50:57.522]  I mean, I used to work in a paint store, so I'm probably a slow boy from the chemicals that I was around.
[03:50:57.522 --> 03:50:58.102]  I don't even know.
[03:50:58.102 --> 03:51:04.526]  But this says that we're going to have to change the brain, and I think this is probably talking about shutting off critical thinking faculty.
[03:51:05.302 --> 03:51:09.205]  Right now there was that video that's gone around for years.
[03:51:09.205 --> 03:51:22.175]  It's 15 years old where it appears to be a Pentagon debriefing talk about stabby's right that can shut off various areas of the brain, particularly relating to higher cognitive faculties and.
[03:51:23.237 --> 03:51:25.538]  Theology and religious experiences, right?
[03:51:25.538 --> 03:51:28.839]  Now, again, I can't prove that that video is real.
[03:51:28.839 --> 03:51:34.500]  If you go and look, even the fact checkers, like the Snopes and the Reuters, they don't know if it's real or not.
[03:51:34.500 --> 03:51:35.521]  Nobody actually knows.
[03:51:35.521 --> 03:51:41.803]  Now, it was redone as this fake thing, claiming it was Bill Gates, which obviously it's not Bill Gates up there.
[03:51:41.803 --> 03:51:45.284]  Don't know who it is, but to me it looks like a real thing, a real discussion.
[03:51:45.284 --> 03:51:52.146]  And whether I know that video is real or not, it doesn't matter, because I know that DARPA and I know that all these white papers discuss that that's what they're after.
[03:51:52.922 --> 03:52:05.146]  I can give you the actual white papers that talk about those kinds of things, targeting specific areas of the brain with this nanotech, with these injections or whatever, with these poisons basically.
[03:52:05.146 --> 03:52:08.206]  And so I don't have to know if that video is real or not.
[03:52:08.206 --> 03:52:20.330]  The document goes on to say that we have the potential by developing new weapons of harming the brain, the potential to engage neuroscience and technology in many different approaches to human ecology, to influence human ecology.
[03:52:21.284 --> 03:52:25.266]  And then we can very easily turn a civilian technology into a military one.
[03:52:25.266 --> 03:52:37.672]  So, in other words, when Silicon Valley invents the latest technology of this or that, they can just weaponize it and turn it into something that is capable of destroying their enemies and targeting their enemies, which is just the domestic population.
[03:52:37.672 --> 03:52:40.313]  And it literally goes on to say, well, who's the enemy here?
[03:52:40.313 --> 03:52:42.254]  It says potentially anyone.
[03:52:42.254 --> 03:52:44.195]  Potentially anyone using the Internet.
[03:52:44.195 --> 03:52:44.755]  I'm not joking.
[03:52:45.516 --> 03:52:56.584]  Anyone using the internet and cell phones is potentially the enemy, because they can come in contact with disinformation, aka truth, and then they're an enemy combatant.
[03:52:56.584 --> 03:52:57.124]  I'm not joking.
[03:52:57.124 --> 03:52:58.926]  That's what this document says.
[03:52:58.926 --> 03:53:00.187]  And it says, well, what's our goal?
[03:53:00.187 --> 03:53:01.968]  Total control.
[03:53:01.968 --> 03:53:04.570]  Total control can be achieved through cognitive warfare,
[03:53:05.242 --> 03:53:11.845]  Which has universal reach from starting with the individual to states and multinational organizations.
[03:53:11.845 --> 03:53:17.507]  It is a field of action that is global and its aim is to seize control of the human being.
[03:53:17.507 --> 03:53:20.248]  Civilian as well as military.
[03:53:20.248 --> 03:53:21.429]  Mastering the human domain.
[03:53:21.429 --> 03:53:22.489]  Full spectrum dominance.
[03:53:22.489 --> 03:53:24.310]  Total control.
[03:53:24.310 --> 03:53:28.892]  So, you ask, well, what's the World Order's plan?
[03:53:28.892 --> 03:53:31.292]  Why would they put it in papers?
[03:53:31.292 --> 03:53:32.633]  Why would they put it up there?
[03:53:32.633 --> 03:53:34.914]  Because that's a form of psyops to tell you.
[03:53:35.925 --> 03:53:36.866]  Call Gaslighting.
[03:53:36.866 --> 03:53:40.048]  Go watch the movie Gaslight, the movie by George Cukor.
[03:53:40.048 --> 03:53:50.274]  That's a movie that shows you the process of what happens on a micro scale when a psycho dude gaslights his new bride, right?
[03:53:50.274 --> 03:53:52.136]  And he drives her nuts, basically.
[03:53:52.136 --> 03:53:53.517]  Intentionally.
[03:53:53.517 --> 03:53:53.857]  Why?
[03:53:53.857 --> 03:53:56.358]  Well, in the movie, it's spoiler alert to get her money.
[03:53:56.358 --> 03:53:56.979]  She's an heiress.
[03:53:59.091 --> 03:54:09.181]  But for the global elite, it's to do the psyops on all of us, to basically gaslight us, to put us into a destabilized, catatonic, fear-based state.
[03:54:09.181 --> 03:54:09.762]  That's it.
[03:54:09.762 --> 03:54:20.832]  Just to make us all in a perpetual, anxious, fear-based, anxiety-ridden, crazy population that then turns to the system, please save me, please save me, I'll do whatever you say.
[03:54:20.832 --> 03:54:21.773]  And then it never goes away.
[03:54:24.136 --> 03:54:25.216]  Right?
[03:54:25.216 --> 03:54:35.560]  It's like a carrot on a stick, like in a cartoon, where you just keep going after the carrot, and you never reach the carrot because it's just dangling in front of you further and further, the more you go, right?
[03:54:35.560 --> 03:54:37.101]  That's exactly what this is.
[03:54:37.101 --> 03:54:37.701]  And they know that.
[03:54:37.701 --> 03:54:40.902]  That's the funny thing, is that they actually talk about that in this document.
[03:54:40.902 --> 03:54:47.405]  The document goes on to say that the world here is no longer targeting a battlefield opponent.
[03:54:47.405 --> 03:54:50.326]  The future of the battlefield is the Internet and the mind.
[03:54:51.323 --> 03:54:53.564]  The inner world of the mind, that's the future battlefield.
[03:54:53.564 --> 03:55:02.050]  And so we have to control information, control info war, control the net, because that's the future of all of this.
[03:55:02.050 --> 03:55:04.351]  And presumably also the virtual world, right?
[03:55:04.351 --> 03:55:11.116]  When people start linking into Skynet, getting into the Matrix, when they roll the Matrix out, then it will be total control, right?
[03:55:11.116 --> 03:55:13.277]  Because then they're in your body.
[03:55:13.277 --> 03:55:14.077]  The Matrix.
[03:55:14.077 --> 03:55:17.039]  What Klaus said, we will get in your body.
[03:55:17.039 --> 03:55:19.541]  The nanotech stabbies are them getting in your body.
[03:55:20.735 --> 03:55:33.022]  And so the document goes on to say, the NATO-sponsored study says some NATO nations have already acknowledged that neuroscientific techniques and technologies have the high potential for operational use in security, defense, and intelligence.
[03:55:33.022 --> 03:55:45.770]  The breakthroughs in these neuroscientific methods are the usage of research findings and products to directly facilitate performance of combatants, the integration of the human-machine interfaces to optimize combat,
[03:55:46.531 --> 03:55:54.496]  And the usage of the new development of autonomous drones, biological and chemical warfare, neuro weapons, nanotech.
[03:55:54.496 --> 03:55:58.699]  And it says this is exactly what DARPA has been working on at the Pentagon for the last several decades.
[03:55:58.699 --> 03:56:00.801]  And it goes on to say DARPA is key here.
[03:56:00.801 --> 03:56:12.829]  DARPA is the arm of this to develop, it says, the research can be utilized to mitigate aggression, foster cognitions and emotions,
[03:56:13.701 --> 03:56:14.562]  Or of passivity.
[03:56:14.562 --> 03:56:21.687]  Remember Brzezinski's book that they could use ELF, VLF to agitate an entire continent through the signals that they put out?
[03:56:21.687 --> 03:56:23.948]  That's in Brzezinski's book, Between Two Ages.
[03:56:23.948 --> 03:56:27.971]  Or they could put out signals that calm everyone.
[03:56:27.971 --> 03:56:36.677]  So in The Kingsman with Samuel L. Jackson, it's literally what's in Brzezinski's book, Between Two Ages, that very thing.
[03:56:39.181 --> 03:56:46.866]  It says that it can induce morbidity, disability, or suffering and neutralize all potential opponents to incur mortality.
[03:56:46.866 --> 03:56:48.788]  In other words, to maim and kill people.
[03:56:48.788 --> 03:56:49.488]  That's what they're saying.
[03:56:49.488 --> 03:56:59.415]  That we can use the nanotech, the emerging neuroscientific tech, to maim, induce, foster aggression.
[03:56:59.415 --> 03:57:01.136]  This is Kingsman level stuff.
[03:57:01.136 --> 03:57:07.101]  And then it goes on to say that the real battle here isn't, again, the warfare of the field.
[03:57:07.101 --> 03:57:08.241]  The real warfare is
[03:57:09.381 --> 03:57:13.483]  The psychocultural domain, culture war.
[03:57:13.483 --> 03:57:19.306]  In other words, movies, music, media, right?
[03:57:19.306 --> 03:57:30.511]  Using those things to change people's thought processes combined with the chemicals in the food, the water, the stabbies, to change brains.
[03:57:30.511 --> 03:57:31.411]  You want more on that?
[03:57:31.411 --> 03:57:33.472]  Go to my shop at my website, get my book.
[03:57:34.438 --> 03:57:48.956]  The COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience, a symbol of slavery, a symbol of the chains that the medical tyranny combine controlled by the global private corporations has put in place.
[03:57:49.777 --> 03:57:55.121]  It is the symbol of the permanent emergency from which we will never emerge.
[03:57:55.121 --> 03:58:03.827]  It is the symbol that we are diseased and evil and bad and must cover our diseased criminal faces from the light of the sun.
[03:58:03.827 --> 03:58:11.372]  It is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to evil.
[03:58:11.372 --> 03:58:14.835]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are crossing the Rubicon now.
[03:58:15.945 --> 03:58:19.228]  The entire future destiny of humanity is upon us.
[03:58:19.228 --> 03:58:25.555]  Klaus Schwab and the UN admit they're coming out with implantable microchips as part of the World ID and carbon taxes.
[03:58:25.555 --> 03:58:27.597]  Things only get worse from here if we submit.
[03:58:27.597 --> 03:58:31.220]  They only get better if we resist and say no.
[03:58:31.220 --> 03:58:33.403]  Noncompliance, noncompliance, noncompliance.
[03:58:35.051 --> 03:58:41.175]  One of the most studied and researched areas of human health and physiology is inflammation.
[03:58:41.175 --> 03:58:42.516]  It's associated with cancer.
[03:58:42.516 --> 03:58:44.217]  It's associated with joint problems.
[03:58:44.217 --> 03:58:47.339]  It's associated with viral infections, bacterial infections.
[03:58:47.339 --> 03:58:49.001]  It's associated with death.
[03:58:49.001 --> 03:58:57.426]  And out of all the incredible compounds that God gave us through nature that fights inflammation and makes our lives better, turmeric is chief amongst them all.
[03:58:57.426 --> 03:59:02.690]  And chief amongst all the turmeric products out there is body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[03:59:03.070 --> 03:59:04.170]  My wife loves turmeric.
[03:59:04.170 --> 03:59:09.132]  She has joint pain, but she has to take a lot of it, the type of stuff she buys at the grocery store for it to work.
[03:59:09.132 --> 03:59:12.133]  She started taking this and said, I only need to take one pill instead of four.
[03:59:12.133 --> 03:59:13.353]  Why is it so good?
[03:59:13.353 --> 03:59:14.673]  It's not just turmeric.
[03:59:14.673 --> 03:59:17.734]  It's concentrated with a proprietary process.
[03:59:17.734 --> 03:59:20.795]  It's back in stock and for being sold out almost five months.
[03:59:21.235 --> 03:59:22.957]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
