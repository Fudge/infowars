[00:00:00.492 --> 00:00:04.796]  I also have some news to share on the president's response to domestic violent extremism.
[00:00:05.316 --> 00:00:12.882]  The January 6th assault on the Capitol and the tragic deaths and destruction that occurred underscored what we have long known.
[00:00:13.263 --> 00:00:17.907]  The rise of domestic violent extremism is a serious and growing national security threat.
[00:00:18.367 --> 00:00:22.611]  The Biden administration will confront this threat with the necessary resources and resolve.
[00:00:23.171 --> 00:00:28.594]  We're committed to developing policies and strategies based on facts, on objective and rigorous analysis.
[00:00:29.054 --> 00:00:34.437]  And on our respect for constitutionally protected free speech and political activities.
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:50.526]  Well, Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, former Obama minion, now serving as a Biden's chief spokesperson, gave a press conference on Friday.
[00:00:51.693 --> 00:00:55.499]  And said that non-governmental organizations, the Southern Poverty Law Center and the ADL...
[00:00:56.894 --> 00:01:00.895]  Are going to advise them on what Americans to put on the extremist terror list.
[00:01:01.215 --> 00:01:02.315]  No judge, no jury.
[00:01:02.795 --> 00:01:06.276]  Our initial work on DVE will broadly fall into three areas.
[00:01:06.716 --> 00:01:18.138]  The first is a tasking from President Biden sent to the ODNI today requesting a comprehensive threat assessment coordinated with the FBI and DHS on domestic violent extremism.
[00:01:18.598 --> 00:01:25.279]  This assessment will draw on the analysis from across the government and as appropriate non-governmental organizations.
[00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.823]  The key point here is that we want fact-based analysis upon which we can shape policy.
[00:01:31.003 --> 00:01:38.369]  So this is really the first step in the process and we will rely on our appropriate law enforcement and intelligence officials to provide that analysis.
[00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:45.055]  And then the military, the FBI, local police, everyone will disrupt these terrorist networks.
[00:01:45.075 --> 00:01:48.017]  Now that's the same language when you heard disrupt al-Qaeda networks.
[00:01:48.618 --> 00:01:49.598]  That means go kill people.
[00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:51.320]  Let me set people up.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.180]  That means infiltrate.
[00:01:52.581 --> 00:01:53.642]  It means take their bank accounts.
[00:01:54.142 --> 00:02:00.927]  And they wasted no time taking the president's corporate bank accounts in New York and now his private bank accounts in Florida.
[00:02:01.628 --> 00:02:02.989]  And if they can get Trump, they can get anybody.
[00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.852]  Just like I said, if they could shut me down online a few years ago, they were coming for you next.
[00:02:06.932 --> 00:02:09.674]  Congress must act and take action.
[00:02:09.754 --> 00:02:11.656]  This is beyond authoritarianism.
[00:02:12.196 --> 00:02:14.318]  This is more sophisticated than what Hitler did.
[00:02:14.898 --> 00:02:20.941]  The second will be the building of an NSC capability to focus on countering domestic violent extremism.
[00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:34.207]  As a part of this, the NSC will undertake a policy review effort to determine how the government can share information better about this threat, support efforts to prevent radicalization, disrupt violent extremist networks, and more.
[00:02:34.667 --> 00:02:37.729]  There's important work already underway across the interagency in
[00:02:39.002 --> 00:02:39.522]  We're good to go.
[00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:17.872]  You have to understand, the Southern Poverty Law Center spokesperson, Sasha Barrett-Cohen, said a few years ago, last year, as their spokesperson, he said, we need to arrest the heads of Big Tech if they don't do what we say.
[00:03:18.753 --> 00:03:26.042]  And so you have to understand, the ADL, the Southern Poverty Law Center, they are funded by George Soros and other criminal groups that have overthrown foreign governments many times.
[00:03:26.562 --> 00:03:28.424]  And the Democrats admit this is a systematic takeover.
[00:03:28.444 --> 00:03:29.224]  They say they want re-education camps.
[00:03:53.883 --> 00:04:03.647]  Uh, for libertarians, uh, Christians, they say that anybody that doesn't take the COVID shots or doesn't allow the contact tracers into their homes will be sent to these facilities to be locked up.
[00:04:04.148 --> 00:04:05.748]  And we're all following UN directives.
[00:04:05.768 --> 00:04:12.031]  They're all making the same announcements in Australia and in Canada and in the U S all in the blue cities and blue States.
[00:04:12.651 --> 00:04:16.253]  And now they're going to further bankrupt the country with an ongoing lockdown.
[00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:18.931]  Get everybody at each other's throats.
[00:04:19.031 --> 00:04:20.292]  Get everybody on the government dole.
[00:04:20.372 --> 00:04:23.955]  Bring in a universal basic income so they can control every aspect of your life.
[00:04:24.936 --> 00:04:27.418]  And so this is the last straw for America.
[00:04:28.079 --> 00:04:29.820]  This is going to break our back completely.
[00:04:29.841 --> 00:04:31.262]  We need Congress.
[00:04:31.282 --> 00:04:32.022]  We need the governors.
[00:04:32.643 --> 00:04:38.128]  We need coalitions of individuals to come together and say no to this clear and present criminal danger.
[00:04:38.468 --> 00:04:42.191]  You can't have private groups like the Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL
[00:04:43.232 --> 00:04:52.717]  Openly advising CIA and FBI at threat centers on who needs to be routed out and who needs to be disrupted.
[00:04:52.877 --> 00:04:54.117]  Those are the terms they use.
[00:04:55.058 --> 00:05:01.040]  Brennan was on last week, former head of the CIA, top levels running this, the military actions against the people.
[00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.481]  And he said, we need to use the military.
[00:05:02.521 --> 00:05:03.402]  We need to use the FBI.
[00:05:03.422 --> 00:05:07.764]  We need to use all the local police to root out these Trump supporters from Christians,
[00:05:13.546 --> 00:05:26.550]  It's so much more difficult today because of what we have seen, not just over the last two weeks, but that certainly has riveted our attention, but because of this growth in polarization in the United States and domestic violence and white supremacist groups.
[00:05:27.291 --> 00:05:33.893]  So I know looking forward that the members of the Biden team who have been nominated or have been appointed
[00:05:34.557 --> 00:05:34.877]  Yes, we are.
[00:06:00.286 --> 00:06:11.373]  And unfortunately, I think there has been this momentum that has been generated as a result of, unfortunately, the demagogic rhetoric of people that's just departed government, but also those who continue in the halls of Congress.
[00:06:12.174 --> 00:06:27.263]  And so I really do think that the law enforcement, Homeland Security, intelligence, and even the defense officials are doing everything possible to root out what seems to be a very, very serious and insidious threat to our democracy and our Republic.
[00:06:27.843 --> 00:06:33.067]  It is illegal for the federal government to use the CIA domestically against the American people.
[00:06:33.087 --> 00:06:37.831]  It is illegal to use the military in a political fashion to spoil the American people.
[00:06:38.371 --> 00:06:39.192]  All of this is illegal.
[00:06:39.252 --> 00:06:49.920]  But what's even more outrageous and illegal is to have the Southern Poverty Law Center, ADL, and other organizations controlled by multinational corporations and foreign funders like George Soros
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:57.942]  To be involved in private intelligence gathering against the American people and then interfacing with the national security apparatus of the state.
[00:06:58.482 --> 00:06:59.623]  This is the purge.
[00:07:00.263 --> 00:07:01.543]  The purge isn't coming.
[00:07:01.883 --> 00:07:02.944]  The purge is here.
[00:07:03.464 --> 00:07:08.305]  Americans don't have reflexes to fight tyranny because we have never seen something like this since our founding.
[00:07:08.565 --> 00:07:13.887]  But this is the same thing the Russians went under, the same thing the Nazis went under, the same thing the poor Chinese went under.
[00:07:14.207 --> 00:07:16.968]  And we now have private security networks.
[00:07:16.988 --> 00:07:17.408]  We're good.
[00:07:46.036 --> 00:07:46.256]  I think so.
[00:08:07.649 --> 00:08:07.789]  War.
[00:08:07.969 --> 00:08:08.490]  Terrible war.
[00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:08.810]  Widows.
[00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:09.231]  Orphans.
[00:08:09.251 --> 00:08:10.352]  A motherless child.
[00:08:10.372 --> 00:08:11.433]  This was the uprising that rocked our land.
[00:08:34.474 --> 00:08:41.567]  Thirteen districts rebelled against the country that fed them, loved them, protected them.
[00:08:41.687 --> 00:08:44.372]  Brother turned on brother until nothing remained.
[00:08:53.559 --> 00:08:54.800]  And then came the peace.
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.441]  Hard fought, sorely won.
[00:08:58.121 --> 00:09:02.604]  A people rose up from the ashes and a new era was born.
[00:09:03.204 --> 00:09:04.565]  But freedom has a cost.
[00:09:05.805 --> 00:09:12.289]  When the traitors were defeated, we swore as a nation we would never know this treason again.
[00:09:13.209 --> 00:09:14.670]  And so it was decreed.
[00:09:15.458 --> 00:09:27.600]  That each year, the various districts of Panem would offer up in tribute one young man and woman to fight to the death in a pageant of honor, courage, and sacrifice.
[00:09:29.061 --> 00:09:38.582]  The lone victor, bathed in riches, would serve as a reminder of our generosity and our forgiveness.
[00:09:38.622 --> 00:09:40.843]  This is how we remember our past.
[00:09:42.034 --> 00:09:44.809]  This is how we safeguard our future.
[00:09:48.217 --> 00:10:02.260]  Students at Harvard now ought to set up kind of re-education camps and moral rehabilitation centers and institutions for vetting people who had the chutzpah to work in the Trump administration.
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:09.742]  And the question is, how are we going to really almost deprogram these people who have signed up for the cult of Trump?
[00:10:10.162 --> 00:10:12.703]  Experts say they see cult-like behavior.
[00:10:12.983 --> 00:10:15.924]  We have, there are millions of Americans
[00:10:17.777 --> 00:10:24.223]  Almost all white, almost all Republicans, who somehow need to be deprogrammed.
[00:10:25.564 --> 00:10:32.890]  It's as if they are members of a cult, the Trumpist cult, and we have to be deprogrammed.
[00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:35.032]  Because they've been brainwashed, Joy.
[00:10:35.112 --> 00:10:39.836]  I really believe that they have been brainwashed by this misinformation campaign.
[00:10:39.956 --> 00:10:43.059]  So how do you de-radicalize these people?
[00:10:43.786 --> 00:10:45.788]  Joining us now is Stephen Hassan.
[00:10:45.848 --> 00:10:51.133]  He's a mental health professional who has been helping deprogram people out of cults for decades.
[00:10:51.433 --> 00:10:54.016]  He's also the author of The Cult of Trump.
[00:10:54.376 --> 00:10:59.301]  There are millions of people who believe that the election was rigged.
[00:10:59.721 --> 00:11:01.623]  How do you begin to deprogram them?
[00:11:02.251 --> 00:11:09.316]  Once we educate them, we coach them on how to interact and empower the person to start thinking for themselves.
[00:11:09.696 --> 00:11:11.817]  I think a lot of people are going to have to be deprogrammed.
[00:11:11.857 --> 00:11:17.341]  We had a program addressing white supremacists.
[00:11:17.761 --> 00:11:26.346]  We had programs, federal programs, that went towards funding organizations like these that de-radicalized people.
[00:11:27.127 --> 00:11:29.628]  And President Trump pulled the plug.
[00:11:30.926 --> 00:11:34.808]  On federal funding for some of these programs.
[00:11:34.888 --> 00:11:39.169]  And so one thing that we know is that we have to get that funding right back up.
[00:11:39.329 --> 00:11:47.353]  And we probably need to double, triple, quadruple or increase funding for these de-radicalization programs.
[00:11:47.653 --> 00:11:49.053]  We can look to history, though.
[00:11:49.773 --> 00:11:53.575]  What ultimately breaks that power structure in the South?
[00:11:53.982 --> 00:11:59.326]  A Bernie Sanders staffer was caught on undercover camera saying that Trump voters should be sent to re-education camps.
[00:12:25.703 --> 00:12:26.623]  Because that's a big deal.
[00:12:26.643 --> 00:12:29.245]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[00:12:29.485 --> 00:12:31.586]  In Cuba, what do they do to reactionaries?
[00:12:33.407 --> 00:12:34.328]  They shot them on the beach.
[00:12:51.477 --> 00:13:04.201]  They felt that this counter-revolution could best be guarded against by creating and establishing re-education centers in the Southwest.
[00:13:05.201 --> 00:13:10.002]  Where we would take all the people who needed to be re-educated into the new way of thinking
[00:13:10.845 --> 00:13:14.327]  And teach them how things were going to be.
[00:13:15.248 --> 00:13:18.830]  I asked, well, what is going to happen to those people that we can't re-educate?
[00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:21.592]  That are die-hard capitalists?
[00:13:22.693 --> 00:13:25.334]  And the reply was that they'd have to be eliminated.
[00:13:26.755 --> 00:13:34.520]  And when I pursued this further, they estimated that they would have to eliminate 25 million people in these re-education centers.
[00:13:35.181 --> 00:13:36.902]  And when I say eliminate, I mean kill.
[00:13:38.478 --> 00:13:39.139]  25 million people.
[00:13:39.339 --> 00:13:47.246]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:13:47.646 --> 00:13:52.650]  Once it's everybody's responsibility and not just the households, then we start making better investments.
[00:13:53.351 --> 00:13:57.234]  I have decided we really need camps for adults.
[00:13:59.359 --> 00:14:03.162]  And we need the kind of camps that you all run.
[00:14:03.182 --> 00:14:04.243]  I mean, really.
[00:14:04.524 --> 00:14:11.669]  The bottom line is all of America needs programming because we've all been negatively influenced by Donald Trump.
[00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:21.898]  And now, a rise of political extremism, white supremacy, domestic terrorism that we must confront and we will defeat.
[00:14:27.372 --> 00:14:29.713]  Alex Jones here with some very, very good news.
