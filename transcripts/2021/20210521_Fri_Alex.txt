[00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:21.882]  SM-102 in the vaccine insert says it's one of the ingredients for the vaccine COVID vaccine and then you look at oh okay let's look into SM-102 and you go to the official OSHA website here and it says for research only not for human use
[00:00:26.158 --> 00:00:37.027]  And then you look at, so then pharmacies will have their own medical documents and then it will say, this is not FDA approved.
[00:00:37.367 --> 00:00:40.910]  This is an investigatory vaccine using mRNA technology.
[00:00:42.111 --> 00:00:43.212]  Says it right on the document.
[00:00:47.535 --> 00:00:51.679]  And then you have leaders of the NAACP going on New York
[00:00:54.282 --> 00:01:00.748]  Uh, airwaves with with Pomo and de Blasio sticking their arm out and saying, I'm not going to question what's in this.
[00:01:00.888 --> 00:01:02.349]  I'm not going to look at the ingredients.
[00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.532]  I'm going to roll my sleeve up and I'm going to take that vaccine.
[00:01:05.572 --> 00:01:06.493]  No questions asked.
[00:01:06.913 --> 00:01:09.315]  Oh, just like the people in the Tuskegee experiment, I suppose.
[00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:20.165]  And they see, they know they can't cross a certain threshold of forcing us to vaccinate.
[00:01:21.356 --> 00:01:38.189]  And so they're trying to dicely, you know, walk around it, you know, we're gonna, oh, we'll just have some vaccine passports to use these things, and oh, just big businesses are gonna make you have a vaccine to go back to work, and then slowly it just increments itself.
[00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:44.034]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:47.496 --> 00:01:49.598]  Ladies and gentlemen, you'd have to see it to believe it,
[00:01:51.974 --> 00:01:52.894]  But you will see it.
[00:01:55.835 --> 00:01:57.075]  You still may not believe it.
[00:02:00.195 --> 00:02:08.297]  I'm getting text messages from friends who are seeing this story elsewhere.
[00:02:08.597 --> 00:02:11.217]  It's being covered at InfoWars.com.
[00:02:11.257 --> 00:02:16.218]  People are going and asking for the inserts to the COVID vaccine.
[00:02:16.718 --> 00:02:20.459]  And of course, you saw the one that just had the digital barcode on there.
[00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:31.745]  But no, you can go get some and find the inserts, and there's a lot of shocking things that you will find.
[00:02:33.886 --> 00:02:43.850]  For example, headline at InfoWars.com, shocker, why is this substance in the Moderna COVID vaccine?
[00:02:44.991 --> 00:02:45.571]  It's called SM-102.
[00:02:49.970 --> 00:03:08.936]  And when you go look into the medical documents on the official OSHA website, the safety data sheet for SM-102 says right here, for research use only, not for human use.
[00:03:10.557 --> 00:03:17.299]  In fact, when I told the guys the headline for today's show, I said not to put it in quotes.
[00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:18.960]  Guys, go ahead, let's just put that in quotes.
[00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:20.811]  Because that's the exact quote.
[00:03:22.272 --> 00:03:23.433]  Not for human use.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.364]  And in California and Oregon, they are readying the mandatory vaccines.
[00:03:38.705 --> 00:03:40.326]  Same thing with New York City.
[00:03:41.957 --> 00:03:49.041]  They're getting ready to force you to take something not for human use, according to OSHA documents.
[00:03:49.362 --> 00:03:55.185]  You have the military walking around on the streets jabbing people at convenience stores.
[00:03:56.506 --> 00:03:58.568]  And then they celebrate it and they bump fists.
[00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.732]  And you know, it's a... It's got diversity too.
[00:04:05.752 --> 00:04:08.474]  Oh, so you have the diversity factor.
[00:04:11.933 --> 00:04:13.774]  And this is, oh man.
[00:04:15.976 --> 00:04:18.117]  See, and now they've got the military involved.
[00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.522]  Oh my gosh, this COVID-19 is a disaster.
[00:04:27.602 --> 00:04:32.005]  This vaccine is an absolute horrific nightmare.
[00:04:32.525 --> 00:04:33.506]  And that's not even all.
[00:04:34.907 --> 00:04:38.209]  I don't even have time, I haven't even had the time to properly go through
[00:04:42.332 --> 00:05:01.297]  The wild statements on these vaccine inserts, like for example on some it just says, not all side effects will be included in this document because they don't know all the side effects yet.
[00:05:01.437 --> 00:05:03.097]  It's just now being tested on humans.
[00:05:03.157 --> 00:05:04.577]  It's just now being waived out.
[00:05:05.278 --> 00:05:06.038]  And they sell it.
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.581]  Like it's a normal vaccine.
[00:05:08.841 --> 00:05:11.342]  Oh, and they say, oh, this is a tried and true science.
[00:05:11.382 --> 00:05:12.623]  There's nothing to be afraid of.
[00:05:12.663 --> 00:05:13.803]  Don't be a vaccine skeptic.
[00:05:14.203 --> 00:05:15.964]  This is not a normal vaccine.
[00:05:18.405 --> 00:05:20.887]  No, it's not a normal vaccine.
[00:05:22.968 --> 00:05:27.290]  And again, you see the videos of arms becoming magnetized after getting the shot.
[00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.451]  And it's just like, you don't even believe this stuff.
[00:05:30.691 --> 00:05:32.172]  How could this be going on?
[00:05:38.482 --> 00:05:40.123]  So maybe that's a magic trick.
[00:05:40.243 --> 00:05:40.803]  Who knows?
[00:05:41.083 --> 00:05:41.984]  Who knows what that is?
[00:05:44.225 --> 00:05:47.747]  Maybe, maybe there's something heavy metallic in the insert.
[00:05:47.867 --> 00:05:48.347]  I mean, you know.
[00:05:49.248 --> 00:05:51.549]  Nobody's dug a microchip out of themselves yet.
[00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.970]  That'll be the day.
[00:05:55.151 --> 00:05:57.012]  But I mean, let's just start basic.
[00:05:57.072 --> 00:05:58.233]  Let's start elementary.
[00:06:01.074 --> 00:06:03.096]  Ingredients included in the Moderna COVID-19 shot.
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:10.484]  SM-102, OSHA fact sheet on SM-102 says for research only, not for human use.
[00:06:10.744 --> 00:06:12.486]  But I mean, they're telling you this is a research.
[00:06:12.546 --> 00:06:17.569]  They're doing research on the COVID vaccine, the new mRNA technology.
[00:06:17.609 --> 00:06:19.151]  They're doing research on you right now.
[00:06:19.251 --> 00:06:22.753]  You are part of a giant worldwide research project.
[00:06:22.913 --> 00:06:23.934]  Congratulations for you!
[00:06:26.216 --> 00:06:32.421]  Filling in for Alex today, but he will be joining us coming up shortly here in the first hour.
[00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:37.472]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday, May 21st, 2021.
[00:06:37.692 --> 00:06:40.655]  Yes, this is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:42.697 --> 00:06:47.341]  And I've got stacks and stacks and stacks of news.
[00:06:49.563 --> 00:06:49.944]  Wow.
[00:06:52.506 --> 00:06:52.746]  Wow.
[00:06:56.038 --> 00:07:01.603]  So we're going to get into what I just covered in the opening segment, but yes, we covered it yesterday.
[00:07:01.763 --> 00:07:04.746]  Alex broke with special reports yesterday.
[00:07:04.766 --> 00:07:07.028]  We have new reports coming out.
[00:07:08.269 --> 00:07:10.311]  We have other reporters noticing things.
[00:07:11.971 --> 00:07:12.852]  Hey look, you know what?
[00:07:13.252 --> 00:07:13.972]  I hope we're wrong.
[00:07:14.072 --> 00:07:21.177]  I hope this vaccine isn't a weapon and isn't gonna kill a bunch of people and then these are just coincidences and all of this stuff.
[00:07:21.397 --> 00:07:21.657]  I do.
[00:07:21.937 --> 00:07:22.778]  I really do, folks.
[00:07:22.978 --> 00:07:23.358]  Believe me.
[00:07:23.758 --> 00:07:24.279]  I really do.
[00:07:24.659 --> 00:07:25.820]  I hope we're all wrong about this.
[00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:30.182]  But... No one else wants to report on it.
[00:07:30.963 --> 00:07:32.964]  We read the actual medical literature.
[00:07:33.504 --> 00:07:34.865]  We read the actual inserts.
[00:07:34.925 --> 00:07:36.086]  We look at the ingredients.
[00:07:36.626 --> 00:07:38.047]  We follow all the side effects.
[00:07:38.087 --> 00:07:39.268]  We follow all the stories.
[00:07:42.409 --> 00:07:43.709]  And we just report the truth!
[00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:55.653]  Like, S-M-1-O-2 in the vaccine insert says it's one of the ingredients for the vaccine.
[00:07:57.433 --> 00:07:58.253]  COVID vaccine.
[00:07:59.814 --> 00:08:02.814]  And then you look at, oh, okay, let's look into S-M-1-O-2.
[00:08:03.735 --> 00:08:08.656]  And you go to the official OSHA website here and it says, for research only, not for human use.
[00:08:12.935 --> 00:08:27.686]  And then you look at, so then pharmacies will have their own medical documents and then it will say, this is not FDA approved, this is an investigatory vaccine using mRNA technology.
[00:08:28.887 --> 00:08:29.988]  Says it right on the document.
[00:08:34.292 --> 00:08:38.435]  And then you have leaders of the NAACP going on New York
[00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:53.265]  Airwaves with Pomo and de Blasio sticking their arm out and saying, I'm not gonna question what's in this, I'm not gonna look at the ingredients, I'm gonna roll my sleeve up and I'm gonna take that vaccine, no questions asked.
[00:08:53.666 --> 00:08:56.087]  Oh, just like the people in the Tuskegee experiment, I suppose.
[00:09:01.249 --> 00:09:06.912]  And they, see, they know they can't cross a certain threshold of forcing us to vaccinate
[00:09:08.108 --> 00:09:24.957]  And so they're trying to dicely walk around it, you know, we're gonna, oh, we'll just have some vaccine passports to use these things, and oh, just big businesses are gonna make you have a vaccine to go back to work, and then slowly it just increments itself.
[00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.659]  But so, I'm gonna get to all that.
[00:09:28.779 --> 00:09:30.299]  We'll do whole segments on that.
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:31.820]  We'll talk to Alex about that.
[00:09:34.602 --> 00:09:37.123]  But I mean, okay, so that's kind of a big deal.
[00:09:39.841 --> 00:09:58.649]  How about we have a... I mean, I guess it was already known, but now the Soros-elected, Soros-funded and elected sheriff in Maricopa County, Paul Penzone, is basically doing everything he can to stop the audit in Maricopa County.
[00:09:58.949 --> 00:10:03.310]  Of course, he got more funding than any other elected official from George Soros.
[00:10:04.071 --> 00:10:04.531]  The most!
[00:10:05.531 --> 00:10:07.072]  Boy, they really wanted that.
[00:10:08.345 --> 00:10:10.906]  And then you notice, who was the one before?
[00:10:10.966 --> 00:10:13.166]  It was Joe Arpaio, a great patriot?
[00:10:15.287 --> 00:10:15.427]  Oh!
[00:10:15.967 --> 00:10:16.387]  Uh-huh.
[00:10:17.668 --> 00:10:28.331]  So you get rid of a great American patriot, who backs Donald Trump, and you put in a Soros-funded leftist activist,
[00:10:29.508 --> 00:10:35.809]  And now he's blocking the audit into the Maricopa County 2020 presidential election results that you rigged and stole.
[00:10:36.549 --> 00:10:42.050]  I mean, they had this whole thing planned so well from the beginning, how they were going to steal this election.
[00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:46.451]  And Maricopa County was one of the places they knew they were going to do it bigger than ever.
[00:10:47.151 --> 00:10:50.672]  And they got their Soros guy in, and Soros made sure of it with his money.
[00:10:51.712 --> 00:10:55.193]  And they got that Trump-supporting patriot out of there, too.
[00:10:56.553 --> 00:10:56.993]  Oh, man.
[00:10:59.568 --> 00:11:00.169]  Oh man.
[00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:08.076]  Oh, and now Republicans in Maricopa County are being sent substances in the mail.
[00:11:08.336 --> 00:11:09.377]  Unknown substances in the mail.
[00:11:09.397 --> 00:11:12.039]  Because, you know, the Democrats, so tolerant, so peaceful.
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.103]  So the exact opposite of everything they claim to be.
[00:11:16.663 --> 00:11:17.264]  Okay.
[00:11:20.126 --> 00:11:21.728]  Then you've got Biden.
[00:11:23.561 --> 00:11:32.468]  The man driving the fake steering wheel, the man who's not in charge, the man who's told what to do, the empty suit, the mental patient.
[00:11:35.471 --> 00:11:40.635]  The least of which of what he's doing right now, signing the anti-Asian hate crime bill.
[00:11:40.875 --> 00:11:41.576]  Isn't that funny?
[00:11:43.617 --> 00:11:44.458]  Isn't that funny?
[00:11:44.498 --> 00:11:47.701]  So are we going to address who is committing all the Asian hate crimes?
[00:11:47.721 --> 00:11:49.182]  I mean, let's just be honest, it's black people.
[00:11:50.233 --> 00:11:51.554]  But no, no, no, no, no.
[00:11:51.594 --> 00:11:56.556]  They're going to say Black Lives Matter out of the left side of their mouth, Asian Lives Matter out of the right side of their mouth.
[00:11:56.576 --> 00:12:01.579]  Kind of like they're going to say, you know, LGBTQ plus rights and wave their flags all over.
[00:12:01.839 --> 00:12:05.041]  But then they're going to support Hamas and radical Islam.
[00:12:06.822 --> 00:12:07.882]  Yes, that is the left.
[00:12:08.162 --> 00:12:09.623]  Total mental patience.
[00:12:09.683 --> 00:12:10.583]  Can't think straight.
[00:12:11.824 --> 00:12:12.805]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:12:14.025 --> 00:12:14.686]  These people are in power.
[00:12:16.721 --> 00:12:19.163]  These people are in power and want more power.
[00:12:19.824 --> 00:12:21.825]  Like, you have David Hogg going on CNN.
[00:12:22.066 --> 00:12:22.646]  It was unbelievable.
[00:12:22.666 --> 00:12:24.588]  I was listening to the American Journal, listening to this clip.
[00:12:26.069 --> 00:12:37.058]  And I don't like to be redundant here at InfoWars and play the same clips all day, so I wasn't going to play it, but it's like... David Hogg and CNN saying Marjorie Taylor Greene doesn't deserve a firearm.
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:43.804]  And, you know, it's just... They don't get what they're saying.
[00:12:45.319 --> 00:12:46.160]  They really don't.
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:58.892]  When you're telling a free man that you're going to take their firearm, that they don't have the right to defend themselves, you don't realize what you're doing.
[00:12:58.912 --> 00:13:00.694]  You don't realize what you're asking for, do you?
[00:13:01.094 --> 00:13:04.717]  Now imagine though, they want to disarm their political opposition.
[00:13:04.998 --> 00:13:09.902]  This is the most violent, hate-filled group in America right now.
[00:13:10.743 --> 00:13:15.046]  The Democrat Party, their street thugs, Antifa, Black Lives Matter, you name it.
[00:13:15.487 --> 00:13:17.729]  They're attacking members of Congress.
[00:13:17.749 --> 00:13:19.590]  They're shooting members of Congress.
[00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:24.414]  They're threatening anybody they disagree with, and they want to disarm us?
[00:13:25.274 --> 00:13:26.055]  Wow!
[00:13:26.455 --> 00:13:28.117]  Oh, I don't know where that's going at all!
[00:13:29.201 --> 00:13:31.322]  No, I can't do the math on that.
[00:13:31.382 --> 00:13:32.422]  Nope, that, no.
[00:13:33.242 --> 00:13:41.165]  So you liberals go on TV and suggest you're going to take free men and free women's firearms.
[00:13:41.865 --> 00:13:43.925]  I really don't think you know what you're asking for.
[00:13:47.667 --> 00:13:48.787]  So you better watch your mouths.
[00:13:53.305 --> 00:13:56.929]  But the Biden anti-Asian hate crime bill is the least of our concerns.
[00:13:56.949 --> 00:14:03.135]  It just shows how out of their minds they are, or they just won't even be honest, or anything's a political stunt these days.
[00:14:05.858 --> 00:14:08.901]  But no, here's some more concerning things that should be highlighted.
[00:14:10.123 --> 00:14:14.765]  Energy Secretary Granholm's investment in electric vehicle battery company sparks concern.
[00:14:15.385 --> 00:14:22.209]  Millions of dollars the Energy Secretary appointed by Biden has invested in electric vehicle batteries.
[00:14:22.889 --> 00:14:28.832]  And he's in control of the monies from the government that will go into energy.
[00:14:30.372 --> 00:14:35.735]  So, if you want to make a lot of money in the next couple years, I'd invest in what that guy's invested in.
[00:14:37.185 --> 00:14:40.686]  Excuse me, she, oh boy, I'm a real, Jennifer Granholm.
[00:14:41.926 --> 00:14:44.747]  I forgot, the crooks come in all different shapes and sizes as Democrats.
[00:14:45.887 --> 00:15:01.510]  So you want to make a bunch of money and invest your money in electric car batteries like Proterra, like the Biden administration member Jennifer Granholm has, the energy secretary, who I'm sure will be boosting those stocks nicely.
[00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:03.971]  Mm-hmm, nice, nice.
[00:15:05.202 --> 00:15:08.363]  This Biden pick has worked for top offshore wind firms.
[00:15:08.683 --> 00:15:10.624]  Now he's poised to help oversee the industry.
[00:15:11.164 --> 00:15:13.465]  And they don't mention it in this article, but other people are covering it.
[00:15:13.805 --> 00:15:17.946]  He's also heavily invested in the wind farm industry and windmills.
[00:15:18.306 --> 00:15:23.568]  Oh, and now he's going to be doling out money to that, quote unquote, green energy.
[00:15:23.788 --> 00:15:31.270]  So, oh, yeah, you want to shut off America's energy, bring in people who are invested in alternative energies that have failed us over time.
[00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:32.550]  It doesn't stop there.
[00:15:32.991 --> 00:15:33.931]  Another Biden
[00:15:35.006 --> 00:15:40.807]  Appointee, nominee to the intelligence community, has worked for Huawei!
[00:15:42.268 --> 00:15:49.509]  You know, the Huawei that helps the Chinese communists round up dissidents and throw them into death camps and slave labor, that Huawei?
[00:15:49.589 --> 00:15:52.930]  Yeah, they're bringing one of those employees into the Biden administration too.
[00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:55.110]  Boy, this is quite a bunch, isn't it?
[00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:56.431]  Quite a bunch from Joe Biden.
[00:15:57.131 --> 00:16:02.652]  You know, I've got all this serious news to get to here, and we're going to get to all of it, and I've got to just
[00:16:04.602 --> 00:16:10.889]  This vaccine stuff is so crazy, but we need to highlight how dangerous, because it's like, what's more dangerous?
[00:16:10.909 --> 00:16:11.650]  The vaccine?
[00:16:12.991 --> 00:16:13.712]  What's more dangerous?
[00:16:13.752 --> 00:16:17.556]  The left taking over and implementing globalism and destroying the United States?
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.103]  And what do we have a chance at stopping?
[00:16:26.184 --> 00:16:29.145]  But I guess we could read people the ingredients to the vaccine and that may stop them.
[00:16:29.285 --> 00:16:34.466]  But I actually need to get more documents, so I'm waiting for the crew to get me some other documents so that I can add to this.
[00:16:34.486 --> 00:16:36.847]  So that you can understand how dangerous that is.
[00:16:38.687 --> 00:16:41.388]  I've got all this important news, but I have to tell you right now before we get started.
[00:16:42.088 --> 00:16:49.530]  I have to admit, I am addicted to the new Fizzy Magnesium at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:51.470]  It's a bit of a problem.
[00:16:53.246 --> 00:16:58.169]  So, well I'll take it off my side desk here so you can see that I'm drinking the Fizzy Magnesium right now.
[00:16:58.629 --> 00:17:05.873]  So, I'm becoming addicted to the Fizzy Magnesium from Infowarstore.com and it's a bit of a concern amongst the crew.
[00:17:06.553 --> 00:17:09.655]  So, I may be going away for a couple days when Alex gets back.
[00:17:10.376 --> 00:17:13.357]  It's becoming a really serious issue here.
[00:17:13.517 --> 00:17:19.921]  So, if you don't see me again, just know I'm fighting my Fizzy Magnesium addiction.
[00:17:21.092 --> 00:17:23.053]  Of course, it's good for me, so it doesn't matter.
[00:17:23.113 --> 00:17:25.114]  I can drink as much as I want.
[00:17:25.194 --> 00:17:25.894]  Ha ha ha.
[00:17:26.774 --> 00:17:27.635]  Fizzy Magnesium.
[00:17:28.255 --> 00:17:31.176]  Exclusively available on sale right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:17:31.597 --> 00:17:34.218]  And it's your support there that keeps us on the air.
[00:17:34.318 --> 00:17:35.798]  Again, Alex Jones coming up here.
[00:17:36.479 --> 00:17:38.920]  He's supposed to be joining us in the next segment, so stay tuned for that.
[00:17:40.516 --> 00:17:46.022]  I'm going to wait with Alex to get into all of this COVID news.
[00:17:46.042 --> 00:17:50.367]  I'm going to wait until I get these other documents on my desk as well to just highlight this.
[00:17:51.748 --> 00:17:54.731]  But let me get into the stuff that worries me about the Biden administration here.
[00:17:55.011 --> 00:17:55.952]  And let me just say, the
[00:17:57.389 --> 00:18:05.418]  Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and then, like, Letitia James of the world that are involved politically, these are the most dangerous people in America right now, politically.
[00:18:05.458 --> 00:18:11.204]  Now, I know Biden is not in control, but he's still the head of it, so he's allowing all of this to go on.
[00:18:12.285 --> 00:18:15.228]  He's the figurehead, so he is the danger.
[00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:18.952]  But, you know, I just have to say, before I get into that,
[00:18:21.283 --> 00:18:24.704]  This is one of the more ridiculous things you're ever going to see in your life.
[00:18:25.605 --> 00:18:27.545]  I mean, every day it's like that, I know.
[00:18:28.146 --> 00:18:30.767]  Little knit penises for transgender babies.
[00:18:30.827 --> 00:18:34.308]  I mean, yeah, we're getting into some crazy times here.
[00:18:36.469 --> 00:18:43.811]  But liberals, Democrat voters, progressives, these people don't even live in reality anymore, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:44.752 --> 00:18:48.093]  They don't even live in reality anymore.
[00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:53.512]  This story from the Washington Post from Mary Beth Sheridan.
[00:18:53.552 --> 00:18:54.012]  Headline.
[00:18:55.493 --> 00:18:57.854]  Mexico's coronavirus deaths are plummeting.
[00:18:58.395 --> 00:19:01.556]  The Biden wall could be a factor.
[00:19:02.637 --> 00:19:03.638]  I kid you not.
[00:19:03.938 --> 00:19:12.182]  In the headline, not only giving Biden credit for the wall, but also it's a good thing now.
[00:19:15.004 --> 00:19:16.004]  The Biden wall.
[00:19:16.605 --> 00:19:17.605]  Washington Post.
[00:19:18.085 --> 00:19:19.106]  The Biden wall.
[00:19:20.805 --> 00:19:21.446]  A good thing.
[00:19:22.867 --> 00:19:23.787]  It doesn't stop there.
[00:19:24.868 --> 00:19:25.929]  You read into the story.
[00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:37.738]  They then claim, thanks to Joe Biden for getting the vaccine out so quickly, that that's the other cause why COVID deaths are plummeting.
[00:19:38.018 --> 00:19:45.684]  So not only do they give credit to the wall, which Biden stopped, they give Biden credit for building the wall, which they were all against.
[00:19:47.435 --> 00:19:52.980]  They give Biden credit for building the wall, and then they give Biden credit for getting the vaccines out.
[00:19:55.122 --> 00:19:57.124]  These people don't live in reality.
[00:19:58.785 --> 00:20:02.228]  Mary Beth Sheridan doesn't live in reality.
[00:20:02.408 --> 00:20:03.729]  She writes for the Washington Post.
[00:20:10.475 --> 00:20:12.536]  Let's get into what the Biden administration is up to.
[00:20:13.357 --> 00:20:16.038]  But let me just say this before I get into it, because it needs to be said.
[00:20:16.779 --> 00:20:27.145]  When you have Kamala Harris admitting to media during interviews that she keeps a list of her enemies, you need to be on alert about how dangerous that woman is.
[00:20:28.106 --> 00:20:29.186]  She keeps a list of her enemies?
[00:20:29.226 --> 00:20:29.627]  I wonder if...
[00:20:31.055 --> 00:20:33.296]  Any InfoWars reporters or hosts are on that list.
[00:20:33.576 --> 00:20:34.696]  Kamala Harris keeps a list?
[00:20:34.776 --> 00:20:36.817]  Sounds like a psycho of her enemies.
[00:20:37.077 --> 00:20:40.358]  Those are the types of people that don't get firearms under the liberal laws, you understand?
[00:20:41.078 --> 00:20:42.919]  But I'm sure they wouldn't point that out for her.
[00:20:43.319 --> 00:20:44.059]  Hey, how are you doing?
[00:20:44.079 --> 00:20:45.680]  Oh, nothing, just making a list of my enemies?
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:48.561]  Oh, you don't sound psychotic at all.
[00:20:49.001 --> 00:20:50.701]  And then you have Letitia James.
[00:20:53.122 --> 00:20:58.804]  You have Letitia James out of New York City who's trying to destroy Donald Trump, doing all these criminal investigations.
[00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:06.693]  You know the old dangerous saying that you got out of the Soviet Union and communist hellholes?
[00:21:08.454 --> 00:21:10.175]  Show me the man, I'll find the crime.
[00:21:10.455 --> 00:21:11.795]  That's Letitia James.
[00:21:12.196 --> 00:21:13.396]  And she doesn't even hide it.
[00:21:13.737 --> 00:21:14.737]  She does interviews.
[00:21:14.937 --> 00:21:17.999]  She goes out on the streets and she says, I'll find Donald Trump.
[00:21:18.279 --> 00:21:19.320]  I'll find what Trump did.
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.160]  She says it.
[00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:21.701]  Here's the man, I'll find the crime.
[00:21:21.901 --> 00:21:23.142]  She's openly saying that.
[00:21:23.382 --> 00:21:25.543]  These are the most dangerous people in our country.
[00:21:25.843 --> 00:21:28.565]  This is what authoritarian tyrannies form out of.
[00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:36.054]  And boy, are they arrogant, and boy, are they aggressive and pompous, and they think nothing is in their way.
[00:21:37.115 --> 00:21:38.056]  And they might be right.
[00:21:40.258 --> 00:21:52.687]  When you've got such a ridiculous... I mean, look, you want to raise awareness about the crimes against Asian people that are happening in America, then you might as well be honest about it.
[00:21:53.728 --> 00:21:56.991]  Maybe Barack Obama should come out and make a statement, you know, the first black president.
[00:21:57.887 --> 00:22:00.289]  And say, hey guys, you know, stop beating up Asians.
[00:22:03.112 --> 00:22:04.754]  It's the white people you should be attacking.
[00:22:04.794 --> 00:22:05.314]  Oh no, I'm sorry.
[00:22:05.535 --> 00:22:05.695]  No.
[00:22:06.356 --> 00:22:07.336]  But no, you don't get any of that.
[00:22:07.397 --> 00:22:10.580]  It's just, oh, white supremacy and it's Asian hate crime.
[00:22:11.521 --> 00:22:15.284]  Even though every video, every attack on an Asian American is a black man.
[00:22:15.925 --> 00:22:16.626]  Or a black woman.
[00:22:19.229 --> 00:22:25.013]  Not Letitia James, she's too busy trying to destroy Donald Trump, an innocent man, because of her racism against white people.
[00:22:25.053 --> 00:22:30.177]  She doesn't like seeing white successful men, so instead of trying to be successful herself, she just tries to destroy them.
[00:22:31.998 --> 00:22:37.903]  But I mean, this is the swamp personified.
[00:22:39.063 --> 00:22:46.409]  Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, who will be in charge of hundreds of billions of dollars of our taxpayer funds,
[00:22:47.998 --> 00:22:57.342]  That most likely she will be giving to electric energy because she is heavily invested millions of dollars in electric vehicle battery companies.
[00:22:59.842 --> 00:23:01.523]  I don't see a conflict of interest there at all.
[00:23:01.543 --> 00:23:02.143]  It doesn't stop.
[00:23:03.444 --> 00:23:06.105]  This Biden pick has worked for top offshore wind firms.
[00:23:06.145 --> 00:23:09.766]  He also has millions of dollars invested in the windmill industry.
[00:23:10.747 --> 00:23:14.288]  And now he's going to be joining Biden's team.
[00:23:17.918 --> 00:23:23.943]  His confirmation hearing for Deputy Secretary of the Interior Department was last month, so that's nice.
[00:23:25.744 --> 00:23:31.369]  So you've got Biden appointing people heavily invested in the windmill industry to be overseeing funds and energy.
[00:23:31.429 --> 00:23:39.216]  You've got Biden appointing people who are heavily invested in the electric vehicle battery industry, and they'll be overseeing how funds are doled out.
[00:23:40.817 --> 00:23:46.602]  And you've also got one more beauty, Christopher Fonzone.
[00:23:48.612 --> 00:23:49.713]  Who also worked with Obama.
[00:23:51.094 --> 00:23:53.816]  He used to work for Huawei in the Chinese government.
[00:23:55.237 --> 00:24:02.341]  So you've got Tommy Boudreaux, about to make millions in the wind industry.
[00:24:02.361 --> 00:24:06.444]  You've got Jennifer Granholm looking to make millions in the electric vehicle industry.
[00:24:06.464 --> 00:24:12.248]  And you've got Christopher Fanzone, who worked for Huawei in China, all being appointed to the Biden administration.
[00:24:12.749 --> 00:24:15.951]  This is a real motley crew, isn't it?
[00:24:17.179 --> 00:24:20.021]  This is a real, this is a real group of winners here, isn't it?
[00:24:20.482 --> 00:24:26.566]  They're about to steal so much money, it's gonna be, I mean, this is gonna be the biggest theft maybe of all time, and Obama set records!
[00:24:27.687 --> 00:24:43.340]  Alright, I'm just overwhelmed here, and I'm waiting to be joined by Alex, and so, I should wait until I'm joined by Alex to get into this, but, again, I've got just more medical literature here,
[00:24:47.308 --> 00:24:50.490]  Uh, hat tip to Jason Lowe who sent me this.
[00:24:52.512 --> 00:24:54.253]  And folks, you can do this!
[00:24:55.333 --> 00:24:59.957]  Go to your local pharmacy, ask for the insert, read it, and by the way,
[00:25:00.862 --> 00:25:07.286]  Some of these pharmacies are going to have different inserts because they're going to have their own medical documents because the vaccines don't have inserts.
[00:25:07.987 --> 00:25:11.049]  And so they're smart enough to know we have to have medical documentation.
[00:25:11.229 --> 00:25:12.190]  We're not going to break the law.
[00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:16.032]  So they'll have their own medical inserts with their own medical data on it.
[00:25:16.793 --> 00:25:18.814]  So there's all kinds of different things.
[00:25:20.751 --> 00:25:24.074]  It's not just the ingredients and the side effects that they know of.
[00:25:24.754 --> 00:25:27.977]  It's them admitting that they still don't know all the side effects.
[00:25:28.657 --> 00:25:30.078]  The testing is still underway.
[00:25:30.419 --> 00:25:32.200]  It's not FDA approved.
[00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:40.346]  It is mRNA encoding, viral spike, glycoprotein technology, which they all say, oh, it's all conspiracy theories.
[00:25:40.366 --> 00:25:41.527]  It's just in the medical literature.
[00:25:41.547 --> 00:25:46.191]  It's just like, we read the medical literature and tell you what's in the vaccines and they call us conspiracy theorists.
[00:25:47.532 --> 00:25:48.593]  Unbelievable.
[00:25:49.841 --> 00:25:57.367]  I may just admit, like right here, this is a summary and does not have all possible information about this product.
[00:25:57.627 --> 00:26:01.990]  This information does not assure that this product is safe, effective, or appropriate for you.
[00:26:03.051 --> 00:26:08.735]  That's the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine drug education monograph.
[00:26:13.799 --> 00:26:15.960]  So I could just sit here and read medical literature all day!
[00:26:17.401 --> 00:26:18.162]  Here's the ingredient.
[00:26:19.884 --> 00:26:21.205]  SM-102.
[00:26:22.045 --> 00:26:22.486]  Okay.
[00:26:23.406 --> 00:26:23.747]  SM-102.
[00:26:23.967 --> 00:26:26.088]  Let's go over here.
[00:26:26.128 --> 00:26:31.711]  Look at the... Here's the safety data sheet from OSHA on SM-102.
[00:26:32.472 --> 00:26:33.973]  For research use only.
[00:26:34.233 --> 00:26:35.334]  Not for human use.
[00:26:38.416 --> 00:26:38.596]  Hmm.
[00:26:41.237 --> 00:26:42.178]  So let me get this straight.
[00:26:44.346 --> 00:27:01.136]  I'm supposed to take a trial vaccine that killed the animals it was tested on, hasn't been human tested, is a new vaccine technology, the guy who's promoting it, Bill Gates, says he wants to get the human population down to zero, and one of the ingredients says it's not for human use.
[00:27:03.437 --> 00:27:10.221]  Folks, if you line up to take this, and I know people that have, and I'm not trying to insult or judge people that have, okay?
[00:27:10.602 --> 00:27:11.042]  But I mean,
[00:27:13.092 --> 00:27:23.043]  At a certain level, you have to understand, Bill Gates thinks if you take this vaccine and die, then you deserve it.
[00:27:23.924 --> 00:27:24.985]  But maybe he's right!
[00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:32.301]  I mean, is that the debate we need to have?
[00:27:32.801 --> 00:27:33.662]  Maybe they're right.
[00:27:33.702 --> 00:27:38.024]  Hey, if you're going to line up and you're going to get this vaccine and it kills you, you signed up for that.
[00:27:38.164 --> 00:27:44.307]  I mean, the left is the one that doesn't want to praise or talk about war heroes, like, oh, they signed up for that.
[00:27:44.347 --> 00:27:44.767]  You know that?
[00:27:45.508 --> 00:27:46.768]  Well, you died from the vaccine.
[00:27:46.788 --> 00:27:47.989]  Did you sign up for that?
[00:27:49.149 --> 00:27:51.070]  Or were you not properly informed?
[00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:52.311]  See, because that's illegal.
[00:27:56.144 --> 00:27:57.845]  Maybe they say you were properly informed.
[00:27:58.145 --> 00:27:59.846]  Here's the medical documents right here.
[00:27:59.866 --> 00:28:05.350]  I mean, what are you going to do?
[00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:13.355]  And so, the amazing thing too is, you'll have leftist attorneys suing car companies or suing gun companies.
[00:28:13.375 --> 00:28:14.336]  The gun companies are the big one.
[00:28:14.716 --> 00:28:15.757]  Suing gun companies.
[00:28:17.162 --> 00:28:27.564]  We're trying to write legislation that says a gun company, a gun manufacturer, is responsible if somebody uses a gun to kill someone in a crime, or commit a crime, that the gun company is responsible.
[00:28:28.185 --> 00:28:35.426]  And then when they can't pass the legislation, they sue the companies trying to hold them responsible on individual cases to just try to sue them out of existence.
[00:28:37.287 --> 00:28:42.788]  But see, they don't want that same application, they don't want that same logic,
[00:28:44.141 --> 00:28:46.562]  They don't want that same litigation against vaccines.
[00:28:47.143 --> 00:28:48.023]  Why the hell is that?
[00:28:48.483 --> 00:28:50.044]  Because it's all a giant cult.
[00:28:52.086 --> 00:28:53.366]  There's no gun cult.
[00:28:53.947 --> 00:28:54.967]  There's gun culture.
[00:28:55.908 --> 00:28:58.109]  But nobody's forcing you to buy a gun.
[00:28:58.289 --> 00:29:00.510]  Nobody's forcing you to go learn to shoot a gun.
[00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:04.653]  Nobody forces you to go shoot skeet at a shotgun range.
[00:29:04.693 --> 00:29:08.695]  Nobody forces you to go become a handgun expert.
[00:29:08.755 --> 00:29:10.076]  Nobody forces you to do any of that.
[00:29:11.756 --> 00:29:15.939]  Ah, but see, the vaccines, we want to force you to do that, so we're not going to go.
[00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:17.240]  We like that.
[00:29:17.381 --> 00:29:21.424]  We like industries that are totalitarian and authoritarian.
[00:29:21.644 --> 00:29:22.344]  We're into that.
[00:29:22.905 --> 00:29:27.048]  But gun manufacturers and that, that's like, you know, self-government, independent stuff?
[00:29:27.068 --> 00:29:28.269]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:29:28.289 --> 00:29:29.770]  They're going to try to shut all that down.
[00:29:31.191 --> 00:29:31.992]  But they'll stick you.
[00:29:33.717 --> 00:29:36.118]  With an ingredient that says, not for human use.
[00:29:36.359 --> 00:29:37.319]  And so here they go.
[00:29:37.359 --> 00:29:39.901]  You know, I was going to wait to get into this with Alex, but I mean, I'm into it now.
[00:29:39.961 --> 00:29:47.745]  So, California County requires businesses to submit COVID-19 vaccination statuses of all employees.
[00:29:48.526 --> 00:29:49.747]  Total tyranny.
[00:29:52.809 --> 00:29:54.870]  Boy, how much does California suck?
[00:29:56.806 --> 00:30:02.230]  Report, Oregon to demand proof of vaccination to enter businesses and churches without a mask.
[00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:08.795]  And you know, maybe that's why... Let me just reach over here to this other stack of news.
[00:30:09.475 --> 00:30:14.178]  Maybe that's why five Oregon counties vote to secede and join Idaho.
[00:30:14.939 --> 00:30:18.241]  So you basically have, I mean, who knows if this would happen.
[00:30:18.482 --> 00:30:20.023]  Maybe this is the solution though.
[00:30:21.112 --> 00:30:34.532]  is to just vote our way out of Democrat cities, and then give them the Portland Organs, and then they'll have the five that go down through Salem into Eugene, and then the rest of Oregon that doesn't want to live in a third-world country hellhole joins Idaho.
[00:30:37.315 --> 00:30:39.337]  You could apply the same thing in California.
[00:30:39.357 --> 00:30:40.158]  There have been proposals.
[00:30:41.459 --> 00:30:44.102]  The Libs, the Commies, the Democrats, they get L.A.
[00:30:44.142 --> 00:30:48.065]  and San Francisco and up and down the coast and everywhere where they control.
[00:30:48.406 --> 00:30:54.452]  And then the rest of California that doesn't want to live in Swallow or in a third world hellhole, they are now in New California.
[00:30:55.182 --> 00:30:55.903]  So it's the same thing.
[00:30:56.103 --> 00:30:57.265]  Maybe that's a real solution.
[00:30:57.325 --> 00:31:00.268]  Seems a little far-fetched, but maybe that's a legitimate solution.
[00:31:00.449 --> 00:31:05.855]  Just give the Democrats the cities that they've already destroyed, and then just make sure they don't destroy the rest of the country.
[00:31:06.236 --> 00:31:08.278]  It's a good solution, I just don't know if it's feasible.
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:14.066]  But yeah, in Oregon, it's soft tyranny.
[00:31:15.203 --> 00:31:19.644]  Oh, oh, which there's really no such thing of, but that's how they're trying to roll it out.
[00:31:19.764 --> 00:31:20.224]  Oh, no, no, no.
[00:31:20.684 --> 00:31:23.285]  You just have to have a vaccine to go to work.
[00:31:23.445 --> 00:31:26.125]  You just have to have a vaccine to go to church.
[00:31:26.165 --> 00:31:28.045]  You just have to have a vaccine to go to the ball game.
[00:31:28.285 --> 00:31:30.186]  You just have to have a vaccine to go to the grocery store.
[00:31:30.386 --> 00:31:31.906]  Oh, you mean I just have to have a vaccine to do everything?
[00:31:31.926 --> 00:31:32.666]  Oh, okay, gotcha.
[00:31:34.207 --> 00:31:36.287]  And so I realize now, too, and you know what?
[00:31:36.307 --> 00:31:37.607]  Look, I'm not a Luddite.
[00:31:39.027 --> 00:31:39.968]  I like technology.
[00:31:41.488 --> 00:31:41.668]  I do.
[00:31:42.998 --> 00:31:48.983]  But see, you're starting to see how it's becoming force implemented where you can't even get a paper menu at a restaurant.
[00:31:49.884 --> 00:31:54.988]  And I don't like going to dinner with my phone on me.
[00:31:55.248 --> 00:31:56.849]  I don't like going to dinner with my iPhone on me.
[00:31:57.029 --> 00:31:58.691]  And so I don't have it and I can't scan the menu.
[00:32:01.587 --> 00:32:04.648]  Again, that's not even me, like, oh, I'm against this technology.
[00:32:04.848 --> 00:32:05.909]  Hey, it's kind of convenient.
[00:32:06.049 --> 00:32:13.031]  The other night, I was at dinner, and they had a digital menu, and it had reviews on each food and likes and stuff, so it was kind of nice.
[00:32:13.251 --> 00:32:14.192]  I'm not against technology.
[00:32:14.472 --> 00:32:20.434]  But see, it'll get to a point where you... Right now, it's just a smartphone.
[00:32:21.675 --> 00:32:22.855]  It'll be a smart chip.
[00:32:26.316 --> 00:32:27.177]  Which, hey, you know what?
[00:32:27.237 --> 00:32:27.477]  Great!
[00:32:28.413 --> 00:32:29.114]  Humans get chipped?
[00:32:29.154 --> 00:32:30.715]  Whatever, maybe it'll be a good thing.
[00:32:31.135 --> 00:32:33.537]  I don't want it to be a part of a control system.
[00:32:33.637 --> 00:32:36.278]  I don't want it to be a part of a human oppression system.
[00:32:36.579 --> 00:32:38.240]  I don't want it to be a part of a global tyranny.
[00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:42.362]  It should all be mandatory, or excuse me, it should never be mandatory, Freudian slip.
[00:32:42.443 --> 00:32:45.965]  It should all be a choice, and if you want it, go ahead.
[00:32:46.565 --> 00:32:47.626]  And maybe it'll be a good thing.
[00:32:48.667 --> 00:32:53.070]  But see, when they force it, then they control it, and then they control you.
[00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:54.751]  I mean, that's what it's really all about.
[00:32:56.893 --> 00:33:02.636]  By the way, there's a new, and this is kind of strange, swollen tongue new COVID side effect.
[00:33:04.337 --> 00:33:10.761]  It's a little unclear about this story, but they say there's multiple examples of this, but they only cite one in this story.
[00:33:10.781 --> 00:33:13.462]  This man has a large, enlarged tongue.
[00:33:14.283 --> 00:33:18.165]  If you look at this picture, it just shows you the ridiculousness of the world.
[00:33:18.465 --> 00:33:19.665]  He's got the mask on.
[00:33:20.206 --> 00:33:23.808]  Folks, his tongue is so swollen, it's like six inches out of his mouth.
[00:33:24.955 --> 00:33:30.036]  I mean, the mask is bulging off of his face because his tongue is so swollen, but he has a mask on his nose.
[00:33:30.056 --> 00:33:30.776]  I mean, it's such a joke.
[00:33:31.477 --> 00:33:34.377]  But so these people are getting in, but they don't mention the vaccine.
[00:33:34.397 --> 00:33:38.578]  They're just saying, oh, it's a COVID side effect or a COVID treatment side effect.
[00:33:40.059 --> 00:33:42.639]  But they don't mention if they've had the vaccine.
[00:33:43.979 --> 00:33:46.020]  Seems like that'd be kind of a thing you would ask.
[00:33:47.182 --> 00:33:48.963]  Seems like that'd be the kind of thing you'd report on.
[00:33:49.003 --> 00:33:54.926]  Maybe this is a side effect from the vaccine, not COVID, but they're saying it's a COVID side effect or a COVID treatment side effect.
[00:33:55.586 --> 00:34:00.288]  So we're still learning more things about this viral release from China that Fauci and Obama gave him.
[00:34:01.068 --> 00:34:02.429]  Why should kids get vaccinated?
[00:34:02.629 --> 00:34:04.170]  We're gonna get it soon!
[00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:06.051]  And then we can play!
[00:34:06.111 --> 00:34:06.271]  Yay!
[00:34:07.091 --> 00:34:07.932]  I'm so excited!
[00:34:08.892 --> 00:34:11.793]  We will get to play together when it's done.
[00:34:12.033 --> 00:34:12.773]  The shot!
[00:34:13.053 --> 00:34:15.974]  We will get to play together when it's done.
[00:34:16.214 --> 00:34:16.954]  The shot!
[00:34:17.235 --> 00:34:19.215]  We will get to play together.
[00:34:19.275 --> 00:34:21.276]  We will get to play together.
[00:34:21.356 --> 00:34:24.157]  We will get to play together when it's done.
[00:34:24.737 --> 00:34:25.217]  The shot!
[00:34:27.176 --> 00:34:34.822]  Wow, so there's more people on their social media account promoting the vaccine now for kids!
[00:34:35.463 --> 00:34:39.186]  The jab for kids, the experimental jab for kids.
[00:34:39.966 --> 00:34:42.568]  And we know they're getting paid to promote it as well.
[00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:56.580]  Thank God for the brave social media influencers who reported this story when they were offered thousands of dollars to promote the COVID vaccine and put their whole platform on the line, really.
[00:34:57.964 --> 00:34:59.887]  This is just sick demonic stuff, man.
[00:35:00.849 --> 00:35:07.180]  And so... Honestly, I... I'm living it and I don't even believe it.
[00:35:07.781 --> 00:35:09.084]  But let's just go ahead here.
[00:35:09.144 --> 00:35:10.586]  Let me just pull up my phone here, because...
[00:35:12.014 --> 00:35:16.918]  I have the document on my phone, but I want to do it live on air with the crew so that you can see.
[00:35:17.878 --> 00:35:20.320]  So guys, pull up a Wikipedia.
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:23.722]  Search SM-102 Wikipedia.
[00:35:24.283 --> 00:35:24.983]  Plug that in.
[00:35:25.364 --> 00:35:30.767]  Go ahead and just put it in Google, because Google like interfaces with Wikipedia, and so there should be a result right there.
[00:35:30.787 --> 00:35:31.128]  Just go ahead.
[00:35:31.488 --> 00:35:32.609]  Guys, I just want to see this.
[00:35:32.949 --> 00:35:34.230]  Let's just do it live on air.
[00:35:35.451 --> 00:35:37.032]  Because again, they say this is all debunked.
[00:35:38.995 --> 00:35:51.297]  Uh, okay, so, see, search, alright, go ahead and put in, um, Luciferese, or Lucifer, Luciferi, Luciferes, so Lucifer A-S-E, basically.
[00:35:51.958 --> 00:35:53.718]  No, no, no, with, with the S-M-2.
[00:35:54.738 --> 00:35:55.638]  S-M-1-O-2.
[00:35:58.299 --> 00:36:02.720]  Or maybe that's on, oh, oh, oh, there you go!
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:04.500]  So, according to Wikipedia,
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:10.262]  Uh, yeah, the SM-102 does have elusive fairies.
[00:36:11.202 --> 00:36:12.443]  Lipid nanoparticles.
[00:36:16.324 --> 00:36:18.886]  I mean, again, I can't even, I can't even deal with this.
[00:36:19.126 --> 00:36:20.286]  I can't even keep up with this.
[00:36:23.148 --> 00:36:27.090]  Don't get, I, look, just, just, if I were you, I wouldn't get the damn vaccine, okay?
[00:36:27.110 --> 00:36:28.630]  Okay?
[00:36:29.471 --> 00:36:30.771]  I'd be avoiding that at all costs.
[00:36:33.993 --> 00:36:34.373]  Wow.
[00:36:35.374 --> 00:36:36.134]  But, oh, you know,
[00:36:37.813 --> 00:36:42.935]  TikTok or Instagram, I got paid thousands of dollars to promote the vaccine.
[00:36:43.475 --> 00:36:48.276]  Oh, you're complicit now in a crime against humanity.
[00:36:48.316 --> 00:36:49.357]  Congratulations.
[00:36:49.877 --> 00:36:50.677]  Good for you.
[00:36:51.397 --> 00:36:52.758]  And you promoted it to kids.
[00:36:52.938 --> 00:36:53.518]  Wow.
[00:36:54.098 --> 00:36:54.658]  Wow.
[00:36:54.678 --> 00:36:56.259]  I'm so excited.
[00:36:57.659 --> 00:36:58.700]  Oh my gosh.
[00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:00.860]  Look at this nightmare.
[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:02.021]  Look at this mental state.
[00:37:02.041 --> 00:37:02.381]  Put it up.
[00:37:02.401 --> 00:37:02.641]  Put it up.
[00:37:03.414 --> 00:37:04.234]  What was that?
[00:37:04.474 --> 00:37:05.915]  That was weird.
[00:37:05.955 --> 00:37:06.375]  God save us.
[00:37:06.395 --> 00:37:06.695]  Alright.
[00:37:28.775 --> 00:37:41.841]  I need to move on because I've got other news and I want to open up the phone lines today because we haven't taken too many calls this week and just intelligence from you on the ground is important as anything.
[00:37:42.281 --> 00:37:45.002]  I mean, I could open the phone lines and say, hey, what are you hearing about the vaccines?
[00:37:45.443 --> 00:37:49.925]  And we'll have dozens of people call in and talk about the negative side effects or family members dying.
[00:37:49.945 --> 00:37:56.608]  Yeah, because that's what, you know, that's a fun Friday, but that's what we have to do here at InfoWars.
[00:37:57.984 --> 00:38:00.625]  Nobody else will do it.
[00:38:02.506 --> 00:38:02.826]  You know what?
[00:38:02.866 --> 00:38:04.487]  Let me finish up with some of this Biden stuff.
[00:38:05.948 --> 00:38:19.114]  So, we talked about his appointees that are about to get fabulously rich off of green energy deals that I'm sure they're going to pass, that are invested in windmills, that are invested in electric car vehicles, batteries.
[00:38:20.675 --> 00:38:22.116]  One of them worked for Huawei.
[00:38:23.036 --> 00:38:24.257]  Yeah, Huawei.
[00:38:24.397 --> 00:38:25.397]  And the Chinese government.
[00:38:25.818 --> 00:38:26.358]  Same difference.
[00:38:29.155 --> 00:38:30.695]  You know, this is the Biden administration.
[00:38:33.636 --> 00:38:37.197]  So, we covered, I guess, was it yesterday or Wednesday?
[00:38:37.257 --> 00:38:39.178]  When was it that Biden insulted the Coast Guard?
[00:38:39.218 --> 00:38:40.018]  I think it was yesterday.
[00:38:40.798 --> 00:38:43.599]  Everything's a blur when you're Joe Biden or covering him.
[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:46.740]  I think it was yesterday we covered it.
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:50.761]  He insulted the Coast Guard graduates and he called them dull.
[00:38:52.181 --> 00:38:57.903]  Well, it turns out that perhaps the insult to the Coast Guard graduates was not the worst part of
[00:38:59.158 --> 00:39:00.000]  We're good to go.
[00:39:08.439 --> 00:39:11.041]  My Coast Guard aides have been excellent.
[00:39:11.061 --> 00:39:12.582]  One of them taught me that
[00:39:32.512 --> 00:39:38.014]  And I quote, the Coast Guard is that hard nucleus about which the Navy forms in time of war.
[00:39:42.715 --> 00:39:54.179]  I can only assume that you will enjoy educating your family about how the Coast Guard is, quote, the hard nucleus around the Navy forms in times of war.
[00:39:55.999 --> 00:39:58.380]  You are quite, you're a really dull class.
[00:39:59.781 --> 00:40:00.601]  What an ass!
[00:40:03.416 --> 00:40:05.417]  What a pompous ass.
[00:40:07.197 --> 00:40:11.538]  First, he steals Regan's joke, doesn't land it, and I love how he even throws in the quote, too.
[00:40:11.819 --> 00:40:16.000]  He throws in, and I quote, you're quoting Regan, you ass!
[00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:29.384]  Oh, and I quote, yeah, you just stole the whole thing from Regan, you butchered it, and then you blame the cadets, or you blame the Coast Guard graduates, and call them dull, because you stole and butchered a joke.
[00:40:31.633 --> 00:40:37.977]  This guy is just an embarrassment of riches, but like, fools gold riches.
[00:40:39.538 --> 00:40:41.660]  Oh, I mean, the media just loves the guy, too.
[00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:43.881]  The Democrat voters just love old Joe.
[00:40:45.683 --> 00:40:48.324]  My gosh, he's not done stealing credit, though.
[00:40:50.646 --> 00:40:59.372]  During a press conference last night, he said he
[00:41:01.363 --> 00:41:05.144]  Helped broker the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.
[00:41:05.564 --> 00:41:06.145]  That's a lie.
[00:41:06.185 --> 00:41:06.765]  It was Egypt.
[00:41:10.586 --> 00:41:12.847]  That story is at the Gateway Pundit.
[00:41:13.187 --> 00:41:14.207]  It has the video and everything.
[00:41:16.348 --> 00:41:17.168]  But it was Egypt.
[00:41:17.349 --> 00:41:18.809]  It wasn't Joe Biden.
[00:41:19.329 --> 00:41:20.530]  So he lied about that too.
[00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:22.030]  But he lies about everything.
[00:41:22.070 --> 00:41:24.051]  And quite frankly, he doesn't even know what the hell is going on.
[00:41:24.311 --> 00:41:27.032]  They don't even let him drive the truck at the Ford Power Plant.
[00:41:28.334 --> 00:41:29.575]  Whose call do you think that was?
[00:41:29.595 --> 00:41:30.695]  Do you think that was Joe's call?
[00:41:30.715 --> 00:41:31.415]  Secret Service call?
[00:41:31.435 --> 00:41:35.916]  Or do you think the Ford plant was like, hey look, this is a $70,000, $80,000 truck.
[00:41:36.457 --> 00:41:44.459]  Do you think we could have maybe the safety driver with the safety wheel drive the car and Biden can just kind of pretend he's driving around, wear the aviators photo shoot?
[00:41:45.619 --> 00:41:49.060]  And you know Biden, he says, oh, I'm not supposed to take questions.
[00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:50.541]  Oh, I got to go.
[00:41:50.901 --> 00:41:52.081]  Oh, Nancy, what should we do?
[00:41:52.121 --> 00:41:53.341]  Whatever you want me to do, Nancy.
[00:41:53.742 --> 00:41:54.902]  He says all this on a hot mic.
[00:41:57.705 --> 00:41:59.166]  No, I'm not supposed to talk to you guys.
[00:42:00.346 --> 00:42:00.987]  According to who?
[00:42:01.027 --> 00:42:05.088]  You're supposedly the leader of the free world, but you're not free yourself.
[00:42:05.169 --> 00:42:05.409]  Okay.
[00:42:05.689 --> 00:42:11.291]  Not even free to drive a $80,000 electric Ford truck that he loves so much.
[00:42:11.311 --> 00:42:12.372]  Oh, he's talking about how great it is.
[00:42:12.592 --> 00:42:13.452]  Oh, this thing's great.
[00:42:13.492 --> 00:42:14.033]  It zips around.
[00:42:14.053 --> 00:42:14.873]  He's not even driving it.
[00:42:16.434 --> 00:42:19.515]  Again, you see this stuff and like, it's just, it's so unbelievable.
[00:42:20.716 --> 00:42:23.397]  I mean, you see the guy's hand on the wheel and it's like, I still don't believe it.
[00:42:23.657 --> 00:42:24.738]  I still don't believe
[00:42:25.649 --> 00:42:31.833]  That it's so bad and the media is so pathetic, I don't even think it's that they would cover it up that he can't drive a car.
[00:42:32.733 --> 00:42:40.998]  I think that they're so dumb and they're so unobservant and unaware that they literally did not even notice that there was a second wheel and a Secret Service agent driving.
[00:42:41.718 --> 00:42:44.840]  Or maybe it was the Secret Service agent who said, I'm not getting in the car with that guy.
[00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:51.003]  And they said, we'll give you a steering wheel so in case he, you know, goes crazy or whatever, you can be in charge.
[00:42:51.524 --> 00:42:52.044]  Okay, fine.
[00:42:54.966 --> 00:42:55.266]  Wow.
[00:42:57.961 --> 00:43:06.888]  But seriously, the White House Press Corps is probably so dumb and so unobservant, except maybe Peter Doocy.
[00:43:10.771 --> 00:43:13.553]  There's other good ones, but they're not allowed to follow still because of COVID.
[00:43:13.573 --> 00:43:16.736]  Maybe they'll let them back in, but it's the limited numbers because of COVID.
[00:43:16.776 --> 00:43:18.317]  No, just the ones that Biden approves of.
[00:43:19.918 --> 00:43:22.100]  They probably are so unobservant
[00:43:23.339 --> 00:43:24.979]  They wouldn't even notice a second steering wheel.
[00:43:25.479 --> 00:43:28.020]  So imagine being so confident in the Biden administration.
[00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:35.541]  You're so confident that the media lackeys you have following you around are so dumb that they won't even notice you're not even driving the truck.
[00:43:37.502 --> 00:43:37.802]  Wow.
[00:43:38.442 --> 00:43:38.862]  Amazing.
[00:43:39.562 --> 00:43:49.484]  And then I guess he assumes the entire world is so dumb that he'll take credit for the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, even though everyone knows it was Egypt and President el-Sisi.
[00:43:53.536 --> 00:43:58.679]  Steel worker union that endorsed Biden now begging him not to end Trump's tariff on foreign steel.
[00:43:58.999 --> 00:44:05.342]  Oh, so all the cheap, bad steel coming in from China is about to come in again and put the steel manufacturers out of business.
[00:44:05.823 --> 00:44:09.425]  And by the way, you know, nobody made a big enough deal out of this.
[00:44:10.485 --> 00:44:12.686]  And I still won't today, but I should.
[00:44:13.067 --> 00:44:17.169]  You know, Biden opened the pipeline for Russia.
[00:44:20.819 --> 00:44:27.504]  I mean, Biden shut down our pipelines and opened Russian pipelines in Europe.
[00:44:28.765 --> 00:44:31.506]  If Trump did that, what would they be saying?
[00:44:31.627 --> 00:44:33.968]  Do I even have to say the word Russian collusion?
[00:44:33.988 --> 00:44:36.230]  Because Rachel Maddow says it a hundred times a night.
[00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:39.652]  We're back here, second hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:44:39.772 --> 00:44:41.974]  Alex is joining us in five minutes.
[00:44:43.135 --> 00:44:43.415]  Again,
[00:44:45.783 --> 00:44:55.139]  I spent a good segment or two on the not-for-human-use ingredients in the COVID vaccine and all the other incredible stuff in the medical documentation.
[00:44:56.621 --> 00:45:12.968]  I spent about a segment and a half on Biden's administration set to make millions and millions of dollars if they get green new energy deals passed with his administration members invested in wind and solar big time and electric vehicles.
[00:45:13.808 --> 00:45:15.289]  So it was never about the climate.
[00:45:15.969 --> 00:45:17.390]  It was always about them making money.
[00:45:17.810 --> 00:45:19.431]  Just ask Obama and Solyndra.
[00:45:19.911 --> 00:45:24.913]  And so I should spend a segment, but see, this is just cut and dry.
[00:45:26.414 --> 00:45:28.956]  Joe Biden is shutting down American pipelines.
[00:45:29.037 --> 00:45:32.900]  Democrats are proposing to preemptively shut down American pipelines.
[00:45:33.461 --> 00:45:36.203]  Hey, a hacker may want to shut down our pipelines, so let's shut it down first.
[00:45:36.664 --> 00:45:38.025]  Good logic, Gretchen Whitmer.
[00:45:40.047 --> 00:45:42.669]  But Biden is shutting down U.S.
[00:45:42.709 --> 00:45:47.274]  pipelines, costing thousands, hundreds of thousands of jobs.
[00:45:49.352 --> 00:45:57.759]  And then increasing our energy prices, but then he okays a Russian pipeline through Europe that Donald Trump rejected!
[00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:04.745]  Trump said, no, you're not going to do this, because they would control the flow of oil through this European region.
[00:46:05.005 --> 00:46:06.847]  And now Biden gave Russia full control.
[00:46:06.867 --> 00:46:09.329]  I actually like Russia.
[00:46:09.389 --> 00:46:15.514]  I actually like Putin, but they'll definitely use this as geopolitical leverage in the region, for sure.
[00:46:17.210 --> 00:46:20.313]  Because Putin puts Russia first at the expense of other countries.
[00:46:20.493 --> 00:46:21.234]  He doesn't give a damn.
[00:46:21.775 --> 00:46:24.097]  But see, Biden puts America last.
[00:46:25.258 --> 00:46:30.884]  And for all the media harpies, like Rachel Maddow, who still can't get over it, she's completely lost her mind.
[00:46:31.084 --> 00:46:35.348]  I don't know if they put her in a straitjacket and take her to a rubber room after her show every night, but they should.
[00:46:39.753 --> 00:46:40.073]  And so,
[00:46:41.345 --> 00:46:43.386]  I mean, you can't even write this.
[00:46:43.586 --> 00:46:44.647]  It's cut and dry.
[00:46:45.107 --> 00:46:47.908]  Joe Biden shut off U.S.
[00:46:48.068 --> 00:46:53.791]  oil pipelines and opened a pipeline for Russia that Trump shut down.
[00:46:57.253 --> 00:47:02.035]  And again, the media harpies for four years chanted Russian collusion over Trump.
[00:47:02.335 --> 00:47:06.237]  They spent about $50 million investigating Trump, found nothing.
[00:47:06.297 --> 00:47:07.618]  Mueller admitted they had nothing.
[00:47:09.908 --> 00:47:13.230]  And now you have, I mean, I'm not even saying Russian collusion.
[00:47:13.411 --> 00:47:14.171]  Maybe there's collusion.
[00:47:14.211 --> 00:47:15.472]  Maybe he made a deal with Putin.
[00:47:15.692 --> 00:47:24.197]  You know, maybe Putin controls Biden with the mayor of Moscow's wife that was involved with Hunter Biden and millions of dollars also involved with child sex trafficking.
[00:47:24.417 --> 00:47:24.738]  I don't know.
[00:47:24.758 --> 00:47:25.818]  Maybe there's something going on there.
[00:47:26.098 --> 00:47:30.221]  But what I do know is that Joe Biden shut down U.S.
[00:47:30.281 --> 00:47:31.562]  energy pipelines, U.S.
[00:47:32.302 --> 00:47:37.746]  pipelines, and allowed Russia to open a pipeline that Trump had them shut down.
[00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:46.835]  And you won't hear a peep about Russian collusion or how bad Putin is.
[00:47:50.257 --> 00:47:54.080]  Because Joe Biden opened an oil pipeline for them.
[00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:55.261]  You just won't have it.
[00:47:56.382 --> 00:47:58.823]  Because it's Joe Biden and he's a Democrat.
[00:47:58.983 --> 00:47:59.344]  And so...
[00:48:01.857 --> 00:48:08.343]  You know, the story came out about Chris Cuomo is strategizing with his brother about how to cover up his sexual harassment scandal.
[00:48:08.744 --> 00:48:13.008]  The word is that Andrew called Chris up, the host of CNN, and he said, Chris, I'm in deep trouble.
[00:48:13.028 --> 00:48:15.410]  I got sexual harassment scandals coming up, all these women.
[00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:18.033]  And Chris said, he said, Andrew, what are you worried about?
[00:48:18.073 --> 00:48:18.953]  You're a Democrat!
[00:48:19.614 --> 00:48:20.355]  So you're good to go.
[00:48:20.755 --> 00:48:21.976]  Alex Jones is on the line.
[00:48:21.996 --> 00:48:23.558]  He's going to be taking over in the next segment.
[00:48:24.098 --> 00:48:25.479]  I mean, Alex, it's all so big.
[00:48:25.519 --> 00:48:27.001]  The ingredients in the vaccine.
[00:48:27.982 --> 00:48:30.404]  Biden hiring corrupt officials that we know of.
[00:48:30.584 --> 00:48:31.305]  Find me the man.
[00:48:31.345 --> 00:48:32.205]  I'll find the crime.
[00:48:32.245 --> 00:48:33.046]  Letitia James.
[00:48:33.086 --> 00:48:34.247]  Biden colluding with Putin.
[00:48:34.267 --> 00:48:35.528]  I mean, this is just unbelievable, Alex.
[00:48:36.465 --> 00:48:47.434]  The former FBI director paying $100,000 to Biden in the laptop emails they had made are real for business, so the vice president would engage in crimes for him.
[00:48:47.934 --> 00:48:48.775]  Open bribery.
[00:48:49.115 --> 00:48:51.177]  We have a corrupt globalist system that's taking over the country.
[00:48:52.018 --> 00:48:53.038]  Something hit me this morning.
[00:48:53.999 --> 00:48:55.360]  I wasn't going to shoot a report today.
[00:48:55.380 --> 00:49:00.044]  I wasn't going to come on air because this has been a kind of a work case shooting.
[00:49:00.124 --> 00:49:01.906]  There's not been one day that I haven't taken off.
[00:49:04.056 --> 00:49:04.236]  No, no.
[00:49:21.389 --> 00:49:26.593]  As the great reset documents, as Operation Lockstep, as Crimson Contagion, as Event 201.
[00:49:26.693 --> 00:49:29.675]  And we're going to break this huge news on the other side.
[00:49:29.715 --> 00:49:30.056]  Stay with us.
[00:49:30.656 --> 00:49:35.460]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live Friday edition.
[00:49:36.901 --> 00:49:40.924]  So many huge developments are unfolding as we speak.
[00:49:41.484 --> 00:49:45.407]  I'm going to be live here for the next two segments that Owen Schroer is going to be taking back over.
[00:49:45.447 --> 00:49:46.808]  Again, I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:49:47.709 --> 00:49:50.271]  Now, we break a lot of big news here on a routine basis.
[00:49:52.185 --> 00:49:59.491]  But the news I'm about to break right now is as big as Operation Lockstep from the Rockefeller Foundation 11 years ago.
[00:50:00.452 --> 00:50:06.236]  It's as big as State Department Miranda 200 from 1974, 47 years ago.
[00:50:06.937 --> 00:50:10.419]  It's as big as Event 201 from two years ago.
[00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:13.282]  It's as big as Crimson Contagion from two years ago.
[00:50:13.942 --> 00:50:17.165]  It is the admitted blueprint for the world government takeover.
[00:50:18.045 --> 00:50:20.788]  And then the end game of the world government takeover is depopulation.
[00:50:21.610 --> 00:50:27.693]  What we're about to play is as important as my historic film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:50:28.394 --> 00:50:37.458]  I have a tendency to break so much big news and have so many incredible guests that I will not go back and review what I've done.
[00:50:38.539 --> 00:50:45.702]  In fact, usually when I'm on national TV or even a documentary, I don't even watch it because I know what I said in the documentary.
[00:50:46.523 --> 00:50:48.564]  And there are so many shows and things that I don't review them.
[00:50:53.086 --> 00:51:07.940]  This morning I happened to just run across randomly a clip of myself from 12 years ago in 2009 on a national documentary television show titled American Conspiracies and
[00:51:09.847 --> 00:51:14.189]  The caption said, Alex Jones predicted it all with precision 12 years ago.
[00:51:14.229 --> 00:51:18.931]  So I clicked it, and we can probably put that Twitter account up there on screen.
[00:51:18.971 --> 00:51:31.176]  I sent it to the producers this morning, and it's word for word exactly what I said then that is now unfolding now.
[00:51:31.196 --> 00:51:37.639]  Now you have to ask yourself, how did we exactly predict word for word what's happening now?
[00:51:37.659 --> 00:51:39.100]  Well, it's because we didn't predict it.
[00:51:40.376 --> 00:51:44.457]  And I remember Dr. Rima Labo, who we should probably get back on the broadcast, medical doctor.
[00:51:44.758 --> 00:51:46.338]  Her husband was the former head of U.S.
[00:51:46.358 --> 00:51:51.360]  Special Forces and then the head of all the Army's secret operations, the head of Army Intelligence.
[00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:55.681]  That was Major General Stubblebine, who died a few years ago.
[00:51:56.621 --> 00:51:57.942]  And some people say he's a bad guy.
[00:51:57.962 --> 00:52:06.745]  I mean, I think he was a patriot overall, but he was involved in volunteer mind control programs, a lot of other, you know, really, really intense stuff.
[00:52:08.163 --> 00:52:14.867]  He was in on the meetings for the depopulation plans back in the 70s and 80s, and of course wasn't for them.
[00:52:15.387 --> 00:52:15.928]  But that was U.S.
[00:52:15.948 --> 00:52:19.510]  government policy in 74, when he was at the head of the Army at that point.
[00:52:21.277 --> 00:52:24.338]  His wife is a top medical doctor who did serve heads of state.
[00:52:24.918 --> 00:52:26.299]  I didn't just believe her when she said it.
[00:52:27.119 --> 00:52:34.502]  I went and looked it up, because you have to do research, and she's had been the physician for multiple heads of state royalty.
[00:52:34.962 --> 00:52:39.724]  There's not many of those in the West, but look towards the Netherlands, look towards the UK.
[00:52:41.064 --> 00:52:45.286]  You know, Prince Philip famously was constantly talking about an engineered virus to depopulate the planet.
[00:52:45.706 --> 00:52:48.647]  They've also made those statements publicly.
[00:52:48.667 --> 00:52:50.088]  So I'm about to play you a form
[00:52:51.147 --> 00:53:06.718]  And a half minute clip that's just a small piece of the depopulation episode, episode 21, that isn't even listed on the Wikipedia page about American conspiracies that ran for three seasons.
[00:53:08.239 --> 00:53:09.239]  I like Jesse Ventura.
[00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:11.201]  I was in the first season, the second season.
[00:53:11.221 --> 00:53:14.303]  I thought it went too much into Bigfoot and stuff in the third season.
[00:53:14.323 --> 00:53:15.824]  So I told him I wasn't going to be part of it.
[00:53:17.301 --> 00:53:17.601]  I don't know.
[00:53:32.381 --> 00:53:38.124]  But I basically did the research for the Police State episode and for the Population episode.
[00:53:38.524 --> 00:53:42.686]  Both were erased off the TVOs, off the DVRs, and both were Deep Six.
[00:53:42.786 --> 00:53:43.966]  You really can't find them today.
[00:53:44.526 --> 00:53:47.708]  It took us some looking to find them.
[00:53:49.130 --> 00:53:51.251]  Not even in our own archives, but on the web.
[00:53:52.411 --> 00:53:54.371]  These shows were seen tens of millions of times.
[00:53:54.912 --> 00:53:57.432]  Congress called for investigations over them.
[00:53:58.653 --> 00:54:00.633]  They called for Ventura's show to be canceled over them.
[00:54:00.913 --> 00:54:05.334]  And that's when the show's creators kind of went into UFOs and Bigfoot and things the next season.
[00:54:07.075 --> 00:54:08.675]  So this is historic.
[00:54:08.715 --> 00:54:09.416]  This is powerful.
[00:54:09.436 --> 00:54:12.996]  It deals with depopulation, deals with being run by the UN and the WHO.
[00:54:13.377 --> 00:54:18.178]  It deals with vaccines that then cause the spread of shedding.
[00:54:19.890 --> 00:54:27.132]  It deals with how this culling was coming very soon because General Stubblebine and Dr. Labo ran in those circles.
[00:54:27.172 --> 00:54:28.812]  They were aware of the plan that was already on the shelf.
[00:54:29.132 --> 00:54:31.473]  Now, the plan was on the shelf in 2011.
[00:54:32.053 --> 00:54:33.313]  That's two years after this interview.
[00:54:33.733 --> 00:54:37.834]  That's Operation Lockstep from the U.N., from the Rockefeller Foundation.
[00:54:38.634 --> 00:54:42.735]  But here is the censored, deleted pieces of the report.
[00:54:43.115 --> 00:54:43.835]  They don't want you to see.
[00:54:43.875 --> 00:54:45.156]  We'll later post the Band-Aid video.
[00:54:45.376 --> 00:54:45.936]  I hope you share it.
[00:54:45.956 --> 00:54:46.256]  Here it is.
[00:54:47.253 --> 00:54:55.101]  There's an entire agenda afoot to force the population to undergo different type of medical treatments, namely vaccines.
[00:54:55.622 --> 00:55:03.250]  We're seeing a medical tyranny being set up, not just in the United States, but worldwide under the UN and the World Health Organization.
[00:55:03.370 --> 00:55:04.411]  Who's behind all this?
[00:55:04.811 --> 00:55:05.712]  The Bilderberg Group.
[00:55:05.872 --> 00:55:10.595]  They want a planetary dictatorship so they can carry out their foresty population agenda.
[00:55:10.815 --> 00:55:12.636]  And they want to do it through the medical system.
[00:55:12.916 --> 00:55:15.038]  And that's why vaccines are so important.
[00:55:15.478 --> 00:55:19.420]  We know that many of these vaccines turn out to have serious adverse reactions.
[00:55:19.781 --> 00:55:21.201]  This is being done by design.
[00:55:21.522 --> 00:55:23.583]  They kill you slowly over time.
[00:55:23.883 --> 00:55:25.424]  That's why they're called soft kill.
[00:55:25.704 --> 00:55:27.726]  And I've got an insider I think you should really talk to.
[00:55:28.126 --> 00:55:29.527]  Dr. Rima Labo.
[00:55:29.867 --> 00:55:35.351]  But she doesn't live inside the United States because she's so concerned about all the police state developments that are taking place.
[00:55:35.791 --> 00:55:39.834]  As soon as you and I finish, I'm leaving the country again.
[00:55:39.915 --> 00:55:40.195]  Why?
[00:55:40.655 --> 00:55:53.705]  Because in a very short time, not today, not tomorrow, but very soon, we'll be facing compulsory vaccination under the mistaken term of voluntary vaccination.
[00:55:54.165 --> 00:56:03.433]  Well, first of all, let's start with the fact that the World Health Organization has decided that we have 90% too many people.
[00:56:03.993 --> 00:56:12.320]  The World Health Organization has been working since 1974 on vaccines to create permanent sterility.
[00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:14.882]  This process has already been ongoing.
[00:56:15.062 --> 00:56:22.508]  To make matters worse, we know that the vaccines that were illegally approved by
[00:56:22.888 --> 00:56:26.854]  The FDA contain a substance called squalene.
[00:56:27.415 --> 00:56:34.365]  Squalene, an organic compound used in vaccines to stimulate the immune system and increase the response.
[00:56:35.399 --> 00:56:44.482]  If I inject you with squalene, your immune system will attack the squalene, but then it starts attacking all of the parts of your body.
[00:56:44.902 --> 00:56:48.203]  What does that look like when you meet a person to whom that is happening?
[00:56:48.223 --> 00:56:49.803]  It looks like Gulf War Syndrome.
[00:56:50.283 --> 00:56:56.965]  It looks like every joint in the body swollen and intolerably painful and immobilized.
[00:56:57.145 --> 00:56:59.647]  This is in these shots they're going to give us?
[00:56:59.707 --> 00:57:01.528]  It's in some of them, but the U.S.
[00:57:01.588 --> 00:57:03.870]  government has a trick up their sleeve.
[00:57:04.250 --> 00:57:13.157]  They will induce a pandemic using the nasal mist vaccine, which is a live attenuated virus.
[00:57:13.637 --> 00:57:17.000]  That means that if I take it, I can infect you.
[00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:18.961]  You're going to get the flu.
[00:57:19.342 --> 00:57:21.804]  Everybody around us is going to get the flu.
[00:57:22.644 --> 00:57:24.826]  Then the United States government, based on
[00:57:25.306 --> 00:57:31.448]  Their statements that they've already made will say, oh my, we have a pandemic.
[00:57:31.828 --> 00:57:34.129]  Oh my goodness, we don't have enough doses.
[00:57:34.669 --> 00:57:47.714]  So we'll admix squalene at the 90,000 injection stations that the Department of Health and Human Services announced that they will ship the vaccines to.
[00:57:49.354 --> 00:57:53.316]  People lining up, sometimes by the hundreds, for an H1N1 flu shot.
[00:57:54.745 --> 00:57:57.427]  What that means is a holocaust.
[00:57:58.228 --> 00:58:00.430]  A genocidal holocaust.
[00:58:04.973 --> 00:58:10.418]  Men and women will sicken and die, and those who survive will be infertile.
[00:58:10.718 --> 00:58:11.679]  Let me tell you a story.
[00:58:12.566 --> 00:58:20.410]  In 2003, I had a patient in my drug-free medical practice who was a head of state.
[00:58:21.091 --> 00:58:27.434]  And one day, she said, you know, it's almost time for the great culling to begin.
[00:58:27.454 --> 00:58:28.255]  The what?
[00:58:28.795 --> 00:58:29.677]  That's what I said.
[00:58:29.697 --> 00:58:30.318]  The what?
[00:58:30.798 --> 00:58:32.361]  She said, the great culling.
[00:58:32.742 --> 00:58:35.025]  C-U-L-L-I-N-G.
[00:58:35.326 --> 00:58:36.668]  When you thin the herd.
[00:58:37.068 --> 00:58:38.571]  I said, what are you talking about?
[00:58:38.991 --> 00:58:43.238]  She said, it's almost time for the useless eaters.
[00:58:44.252 --> 00:58:45.172]  To be cold.
[00:58:45.452 --> 00:58:53.594]  And she said, those are the people who are consuming our non-renewable natural resources.
[00:58:53.874 --> 00:58:55.975]  I said, who are the people who make this decision?
[00:58:55.995 --> 00:58:56.595]  The chosen few.
[00:58:56.995 --> 00:58:59.916]  She said, we, the aristocrats.
[00:59:01.176 --> 00:59:03.656]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, we're going to go to break.
[00:59:04.537 --> 00:59:07.997]  We're going to come back on the other side and we're going to lay out the rest of the story.
[00:59:08.037 --> 00:59:09.978]  That's from 12 years ago, what you just saw.
[00:59:11.232 --> 00:59:14.074]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:59:14.714 --> 00:59:23.279]  Owen Schroeder takes over in the next segment, and he's gotten Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer, who's already filed a bunch of lawsuits, set to file more with Robert Kennedy Jr.
[00:59:23.320 --> 00:59:33.346]  In fact, I'm told that's happening at any moment, on Oregon and other states like New York, saying you've got to have it to go to church, or go in a restaurant, or go in a grocery store.
[00:59:33.666 --> 00:59:38.169]  You've got to have the government put something experimental in you, in total violation of the Nuremberg Code.
[00:59:39.266 --> 00:59:40.626]  Or you can't buy and sell.
[00:59:40.787 --> 00:59:41.527]  It's the mark of the beast.
[00:59:41.967 --> 00:59:43.167]  Violates the Nuremberg Code.
[00:59:43.347 --> 00:59:44.408]  It is completely illegal.
[00:59:44.428 --> 00:59:49.970]  It's one thing to intimidate and lie to people and then emergency authorize something deadly and trick folks to take it.
[00:59:50.230 --> 00:59:51.110]  That's still premeditated.
[00:59:51.130 --> 00:59:51.690]  It's still criminal.
[00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:55.451]  But to do this now is Nazi level.
[00:59:56.412 --> 00:59:59.373]  And so we're going to be breaking all that down with Robert Barnes coming up next hour.
[00:59:59.413 --> 01:00:05.455]  You need to listen to this information and think, hey, just because you're in Texas or South Dakota or Florida where people stand up for more freedom,
[01:00:06.348 --> 01:00:10.730]  They're still Americans, that you're safe because the globalists will take over your area next.
[01:00:10.750 --> 01:00:18.974]  We've got to fight for California and New York and Spain and the UK and Australia and Canada that are still under lockdowns and hellish control.
[01:00:19.975 --> 01:00:25.757]  And the blue cities where they're bringing in such illegal activity, ordering businesses, that's indentured servitude.
[01:00:26.338 --> 01:00:28.539]  And of course, they're saying, oh, it'll be too hard to know whether it's real or not.
[01:00:28.639 --> 01:00:29.799]  Everybody's got to have an app.
[01:00:30.159 --> 01:00:35.182]  So the churches line up for the government to have an app, whether you've taken an experimental injection
[01:00:36.243 --> 01:00:40.506]  Before you can go see your friends and family and worship God?
[01:00:40.526 --> 01:00:43.127]  If you told somebody this two years ago, they'd laugh at you.
[01:00:43.608 --> 01:00:44.889]  But now, here it is today.
[01:00:44.909 --> 01:00:48.631]  There's an article by Adon Salazar off the known numbers currently.
[01:00:49.772 --> 01:00:57.737]  Sperm counts have dropped roughly 50% just in the last 50 years, and they're set to go down by 2045.
[01:00:58.798 --> 01:01:01.079]  99% total infertility.
[01:01:01.139 --> 01:01:03.320]  And they admit in the government studies, oh,
[01:01:04.201 --> 01:01:06.902]  The most dangerous place is your kitchen, your bathroom, your laundry room.
[01:01:07.282 --> 01:01:18.184]  The chemicals being purposely put in plastic linings, everything, lowers your fertility, feminizes men, and ultra-feminizes women, making them accelerate their aging.
[01:01:18.924 --> 01:01:21.184]  All of it was in Brave New World, written in 1932.
[01:01:21.625 --> 01:01:28.066]  Huxley, before he died, admitted it was actually a real plan by his brother, the head eugenicist on the planet, Julian Huxley.
[01:01:29.187 --> 01:01:31.629]  So, here it is, InfoWars.com.
[01:01:32.190 --> 01:01:33.171]  InfoWars.com.
[01:01:33.191 --> 01:01:36.094]  Remember, I did a whole treatise 10 years ago on this.
[01:01:36.875 --> 01:01:38.156]  Just one of many things I broke down.
[01:01:38.176 --> 01:01:41.779]  I covered chemicals in the food and water 27 years ago when I first got on air in 1995.
[01:01:46.161 --> 01:01:53.225]  The media grad where I said, look, I'm not against gay people, but I don't want to put chemicals in the water that turn the friggin frogs gay.
[01:01:53.245 --> 01:01:56.587]  And they took that out of context to make it a joke, but see how vindicated we are.
[01:01:57.728 --> 01:01:59.769]  The frogs didn't try to have sex with our male frogs.
[01:01:59.789 --> 01:02:02.150]  And it happens with fish, happens with mammals.
[01:02:02.190 --> 01:02:02.630]  This is all.
[01:02:02.670 --> 01:02:05.972]  And now they're saying, oh, accept it and push it on your children.
[01:02:06.353 --> 01:02:08.154]  It's about depopulation, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:02:08.654 --> 01:02:09.354]  That's what this is.
[01:02:09.754 --> 01:02:15.478]  That's why Klaus Schwab and the UN want more gay characters and teach kids about it, because they don't want you to have a family or have children.
[01:02:16.454 --> 01:02:23.836]  And those that do, men that get together with women, they then go with CPS and take the nuclear family's children away and give them to them, and they deserve it because they're gay.
[01:02:24.356 --> 01:02:25.336]  Tim Cook runs death camps.
[01:02:25.416 --> 01:02:26.256]  It's okay, he's gay.
[01:02:26.757 --> 01:02:27.777]  You see, this is how it all works.
[01:02:27.837 --> 01:02:40.060]  So it's this new ruling class hunting down the Christians, but it's like we're the humans and it's, you know, Planet of the Apes or something, and the leftist overlords are, you know, feeding on us.
[01:02:41.089 --> 01:02:41.710]  Let's continue.
[01:02:42.050 --> 01:02:43.031]  Fertility crisis.
[01:02:43.091 --> 01:02:48.114]  Men will no longer produce sperm by 2045, says top epidemiologist.
[01:02:48.154 --> 01:02:49.676]  So, there you go.
[01:02:49.996 --> 01:03:06.909]  Prince Philip, Ted Turner, they all see us as animals, as like the Eloy and they are the Morlocks, or they're the apes and planet of the apes, and you know, we're the humans, and they've now reversed roles where the psychos are on top of society and the common good nature people are on the bottom being fed on.
[01:03:07.549 --> 01:03:09.810]  That's what all this is, is destruction of due process.
[01:03:09.910 --> 01:03:16.334]  A total annihilation of people being able to take control of their bodies.
[01:03:17.414 --> 01:03:19.215]  And again, it's all done through fraud.
[01:03:19.255 --> 01:03:20.536]  It's all done through intimidation.
[01:03:21.096 --> 01:03:21.737]  Let's continue.
[01:03:21.777 --> 01:03:22.137]  Report.
[01:03:22.277 --> 01:03:26.019]  Oregon to demand proof of vaccination to enter businesses, churches,
[01:03:27.332 --> 01:03:28.052]  Without a mask?
[01:03:28.152 --> 01:03:29.393]  Well, what about the First Amendment?
[01:03:29.513 --> 01:03:38.798]  Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion, prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or of the press, or of the people with the right to assemble for redress of grievances.
[01:03:40.154 --> 01:03:41.815]  Congress has no jurisdiction.
[01:03:42.175 --> 01:03:44.776]  State governments have no jurisdiction over churches.
[01:03:45.237 --> 01:03:47.698]  But worldwide, the state wants control of those churches.
[01:03:47.978 --> 01:03:51.400]  And most they got control through the ecumenical movement, the World Council of Churches.
[01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:53.581]  The Vatican's head is a globalist.
[01:03:54.101 --> 01:03:55.582]  The main Protestant people are globalists.
[01:03:55.622 --> 01:03:56.642]  Billy Graham Jr.
[01:03:57.103 --> 01:03:58.303]  is out promoting the vaccines.
[01:03:58.683 --> 01:04:01.045]  The churches are promoting QR codes to go to church.
[01:04:01.405 --> 01:04:01.985]  It's all there.
[01:04:02.345 --> 01:04:02.985]  They're doing it all.
[01:04:03.005 --> 01:04:06.147]  And now, Klaus Schwab says, next is an implantable microchip.
[01:04:06.407 --> 01:04:09.289]  The churches will probably have microchip injections.
[01:04:10.029 --> 01:04:11.489]  We're good to go.
[01:04:32.901 --> 01:04:46.840]  To make people verify something that isn't even a law, it's all color of law, the essence of tyranny, and it needs to be challenged legally and lawfully, and there needs to be demonstrations and protests in Oregon, because this is the most draconian move anywhere in the world, except
[01:04:47.776 --> 01:04:48.597]  Not even North Korea.
[01:04:49.157 --> 01:04:55.021]  China said no forced inoculations in their country, and that you won't be penalized on the social credit score if you don't, but here you will be.
[01:04:55.362 --> 01:04:58.264]  And the social credit score is carried out by the corporations.
[01:04:59.245 --> 01:05:11.394]  White House partners with dating apps to promote COVID vaccines, where you say whether you're vaccinated or not, and then people that aren't are discouraged and maybe kicked off the apps, not allowed to breed if you don't get sterilized.
[01:05:12.378 --> 01:05:13.139]  Oh, see how that works?
[01:05:13.579 --> 01:05:14.500]  You won't breathe anyways.
[01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:15.921]  And this is their big endgame.
[01:05:15.941 --> 01:05:20.925]  You just heard Dr. Reema Labo, who was the medical physician for heads of state.
[01:05:20.965 --> 01:05:22.866]  Her specialty was life extension.
[01:05:23.867 --> 01:05:30.452]  Her husband was the former head of Army Secret Operations, Special Operations, and later over the whole Army.
[01:05:31.553 --> 01:05:34.375]  Telling us all this on the show 12 years ago.
[01:05:34.415 --> 01:05:37.438]  They both stubble behind his wife, said the same things on my show.
[01:05:38.803 --> 01:05:39.883]  Folks ought to dredge that up.
[01:05:39.943 --> 01:05:40.664]  They ought to find it.
[01:05:40.744 --> 01:05:42.584]  They ought to repost it to wherever you want.
[01:05:42.604 --> 01:05:44.485]  There's no copyright on anything we do here.
[01:05:45.506 --> 01:05:46.586]  We need you to get this out.
[01:05:47.426 --> 01:05:51.168]  Stanford broke funding laws with experiments involving aborted babies.
[01:05:51.648 --> 01:05:53.248]  Another article in fullwars.com.
[01:05:53.749 --> 01:05:54.549]  And it goes on and on.
[01:05:54.869 --> 01:05:57.530]  This is a scientific takeover of the planet.
[01:05:58.010 --> 01:05:59.531]  This is premeditated.
[01:05:59.551 --> 01:06:00.311]  I'm going to tell you again.
[01:06:01.692 --> 01:06:07.814]  You're in Texas, where our governor finally is being a leader and doing even more than DeSantis, saying it's criminal to make somebody wear a mask.
[01:06:09.073 --> 01:06:10.213]  We need that worldwide.
[01:06:10.253 --> 01:06:15.815]  We need leadership worldwide because they're going to bring all this stuff back with real pandemics.
[01:06:16.436 --> 01:06:18.396]  And with 5G, they can make you super, super sick.
[01:06:19.017 --> 01:06:27.620]  Imagine, ladies and gentlemen, you're going into a restaurant and you walk in, you know, you don't have your face mask on, you're a normal human.
[01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:30.200]  And they say, papers, please.
[01:06:30.641 --> 01:06:30.901]  What?
[01:06:32.061 --> 01:06:33.502]  Prove you've been vaccinated.
[01:06:33.742 --> 01:06:33.942]  What?
[01:06:35.069 --> 01:06:36.151]  Alright, Alex is back now.
[01:06:36.211 --> 01:06:39.878]  Alex, we lost your audio, but pick up where you left off about 30 seconds ago.
[01:06:41.783 --> 01:06:43.364]  Well, Owen, I'm sorry.
[01:06:43.844 --> 01:06:45.064]  My Skype went out for a minute.
[01:06:45.085 --> 01:06:45.865]  I'm going to come back to you.
[01:06:45.905 --> 01:06:57.190]  I'll finish up on the other side, and we'll talk about what Dr. Rima Labo said, how she knew it, and how incredibly important it is on the other side here on the Alex Jones Show with Owen Schroeder co-hosting.
[01:06:57.530 --> 01:06:58.251]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:06:58.271 --> 01:07:01.692]  Don't forget, weekday mornings, Harrison Smith, American Journal, 8 a.m.
[01:07:02.092 --> 01:07:04.513]  All these are transmissions for, of, and by the people.
[01:07:04.914 --> 01:07:07.115]  Only way the dog gets out and hunts when you spread the word.
[01:07:07.135 --> 01:07:09.756]  This information we just broke is the most bombshell ever.
[01:07:10.396 --> 01:07:19.559]  We'll be right back on the other side, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, Band.Video, Tomorrow's News Today, and there's that new URL that gets around the censors for now.
[01:07:19.759 --> 01:07:20.780]  We'll tell you about it when we come back.
[01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:25.241]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live broadcast.
[01:07:25.301 --> 01:07:32.584]  Owen Schroer is about to take over, and constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes is going to be coming on in the third hour today with Owen.
[01:07:33.504 --> 01:07:44.007]  To lay out on a scale of 1 to 10, having the government say to private businesses, you will check that someone is vaccinated doesn't just violate HIPAA or common sense.
[01:07:44.547 --> 01:07:45.807]  It's mega draconian.
[01:07:45.987 --> 01:07:47.087]  It's super dangerous.
[01:07:47.447 --> 01:07:49.068]  It's a global medical passport.
[01:07:49.108 --> 01:07:50.408]  The UN admits they're setting up.
[01:07:51.368 --> 01:07:57.930]  The Klaus Schwab admits will first be a QR code, then a face scan, then a implantable chip in the hand.
[01:07:59.398 --> 01:07:59.638]  Thank you.
[01:08:18.210 --> 01:08:18.710]  Unraveled.
[01:08:19.351 --> 01:08:21.232]  Leonardo DiCaprio is part of this.
[01:08:21.512 --> 01:08:25.194]  He needs to be politically and culturally annihilated, legally and lawfully.
[01:08:25.594 --> 01:08:26.114]  No violence.
[01:08:27.195 --> 01:08:28.595]  All the Hollywood scum pushing it.
[01:08:29.456 --> 01:08:31.917]  Henry Kissinger, instrumental in all of it.
[01:08:32.958 --> 01:08:36.479]  All of these New World Order depopulationists must be exposed.
[01:08:36.759 --> 01:08:39.741]  The chief amongst them, Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab, and others.
[01:08:39.781 --> 01:08:42.803]  They are lying monsters that set up the whole scam.
[01:08:43.483 --> 01:08:46.905]  You just heard Dr. Rima Labo, who was a physician
[01:08:47.935 --> 01:08:48.956]  Two royal families.
[01:08:50.457 --> 01:08:55.542]  Again, the wife of General Stubblebine, who ran all the secret operations, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:55.782 --> 01:08:57.323]  It's been Hollywood movies made about him, okay?
[01:08:57.884 --> 01:09:05.331]  He came on my show, my show alone, and laid out secret information 20 years ago, 15 years ago, 10 years ago.
[01:09:05.951 --> 01:09:12.257]  And they were told by the royals, and I'll just say the royals that are on both sides of the English Channel,
[01:09:14.355 --> 01:09:20.537]  Okay, but I was told all this in confidence, and I've even seen the people's quotes, but let's just, well, you know what Prince Philip talks about.
[01:09:21.278 --> 01:09:21.818]  He's dead now.
[01:09:22.738 --> 01:09:24.299]  And this was all planned.
[01:09:24.399 --> 01:09:26.520]  So that's how we specifically knew all of it.
[01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:28.841]  Plus, I had a lot of their documents, a lot of their admissions.
[01:09:29.381 --> 01:09:30.561]  That's how huge this is.
[01:09:30.581 --> 01:09:34.183]  We just played you four minutes from a report from 2009.
[01:09:35.283 --> 01:09:36.544]  And remember what happened.
[01:09:37.864 --> 01:09:41.966]  This show aired one time, and it was deleted and taken off TVOS.
[01:09:44.229 --> 01:09:48.172]  It aired one time, and it was taken off of even the DVRs had it erased.
[01:09:48.192 --> 01:09:49.333]  It was a big national scandal.
[01:09:49.914 --> 01:09:56.659]  The Police State episode, both the ones that I got them to guess, I did the research on, and I am proud of it, and I am taking credit, by the way.
[01:09:57.139 --> 01:10:00.102]  I mean, I basically, those are real reality shows.
[01:10:00.142 --> 01:10:01.122]  Most reality shows are fake.
[01:10:01.923 --> 01:10:06.145]  But you still script what you're going to talk about and where you're going to go and what you're going to do.
[01:10:06.605 --> 01:10:08.485]  So we'd go real places and real things would happen.
[01:10:08.926 --> 01:10:11.106]  But what we were going to talk about, we'd already discussed.
[01:10:11.646 --> 01:10:14.367]  And so I basically had to vet all the documents.
[01:10:14.728 --> 01:10:16.508]  I had to show them proof of where Kissinger said it.
[01:10:17.008 --> 01:10:21.970]  I had to prove to them what Labo was saying was true by statements from other globalists.
[01:10:23.131 --> 01:10:24.231]  Or they weren't going to interview Labo.
[01:10:25.803 --> 01:10:27.845]  And so, again, that's why it was so vetted.
[01:10:27.865 --> 01:10:32.309]  They had congressional hearings calling for silencing that episode.
[01:10:32.769 --> 01:10:34.831]  Why would you have congressional hearings?
[01:10:35.132 --> 01:10:40.897]  Well, Obama saw it and flipped out because the show's got record ratings for Ventura's program.
[01:10:41.297 --> 01:10:43.059]  And then the show's re-aired hundreds of times.
[01:10:44.281 --> 01:10:47.583]  Three seasons, over 30 shows, but those two didn't.
[01:10:47.683 --> 01:10:56.209]  Those two aired once and were removed because those are the two episodes that you're truly vetted and did the research for and wrote the research for.
[01:10:57.269 --> 01:10:59.090]  And that's why when you watch it, it's so bone-chilling.
[01:10:59.111 --> 01:11:05.495]  So we're going to take segment two and segment three today, where I laid all this out, edited them together, we're going to put them out on Bandot Video coming up in a few hours.
[01:11:06.315 --> 01:11:16.797]  I hope you get it all out because there is the total proof of insider whistleblowers exposed plans for great reset depopulation in 2009.
[01:11:17.877 --> 01:11:19.818]  I mean, again, this is word for word what she says.
[01:11:20.718 --> 01:11:30.560]  Even how they're going to add oils, industrial oils, to the vaccines to cause massive brain damage and infertility because SM-102 does that.
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.261]  She just gave it a general name.
[01:11:33.301 --> 01:11:35.081]  Squalene was the previous oil they were using.
[01:11:36.112 --> 01:11:39.437]  Okay, I've got the safety data sheet for you right there.
[01:11:39.497 --> 01:11:43.703]  So, the good news is Bill Gates and others are being destroyed politically.
[01:11:44.084 --> 01:11:45.346]  I may get destroyed in the process.
[01:11:45.766 --> 01:11:46.607]  I'm stepping up to the plate.
[01:11:47.639 --> 01:11:49.020]  Because somebody's got to take these people down.
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:50.680]  But I need your prayers.
[01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:52.561]  I need your financial support.
[01:11:53.181 --> 01:11:55.762]  Because it costs a lot of money to run this operation to keep us on air.
[01:11:55.782 --> 01:12:03.205]  And we're fighting Democratic-funded lawsuits run by Georgetown University and the Pope publicly has involved.
[01:12:03.865 --> 01:12:05.105]  I know there's a lot of good Catholics out there.
[01:12:05.125 --> 01:12:05.786]  Nothing against Catholics.
[01:12:05.806 --> 01:12:07.786]  I'm just saying, your Pope is a devil now.
[01:12:07.806 --> 01:12:08.727]  I know you know he's not a Pope.
[01:12:09.347 --> 01:12:12.148]  And Georgetown openly through the Vatican is trying to shut us down.
[01:12:12.668 --> 01:12:13.549]  I'm proud of these enemies.
[01:12:13.929 --> 01:12:15.110]  You know, they already captured the Vatican.
[01:12:15.130 --> 01:12:15.850]  They're not getting us.
[01:12:17.131 --> 01:12:22.915]  And the Democratic Party is fighting against these lawsuits that you see all over the news.
[01:12:22.935 --> 01:12:25.556]  We've been battling them for years because they admit the plans to shut us down.
[01:12:26.877 --> 01:12:27.998]  And so we need your support.
[01:12:28.338 --> 01:12:33.762]  We have the trifecta deal running right now only until Sunday.
[01:12:33.782 --> 01:12:36.043]  50% off Ultimate Fish Oil.
[01:12:36.063 --> 01:12:39.685]  50% off X2, the highest quality, good halogen.
[01:12:40.745 --> 01:12:44.047]  Deep Earth Crystal, Iodine, and of course, TurboForce.
[01:12:44.527 --> 01:12:48.369]  All three of those, despite the fact they're best sellers, despite the fact they're all going to sell out.
[01:12:49.209 --> 01:12:50.410]  Watch, they'll soon just be sold out.
[01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:54.031]  I want you to try them and see how amazing they are if you've been on the fence.
[01:12:54.051 --> 01:12:55.732]  60% off on the Trifecta deal.
[01:12:56.052 --> 01:12:59.314]  Again, no reviews yet because we just started doing this deal five days ago.
[01:12:59.374 --> 01:13:00.354]  It ends on Sunday.
[01:13:00.394 --> 01:13:05.357]  It's a one-week deal, but go read the thousands of reviews for Ultimate Fish Oil, TurboForce, and X2.
[01:13:06.517 --> 01:13:10.580]  Five-star reviews, 4.9 stars, thousands and thousands of reviews.
[01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:18.925]  I'm not funded by Bill Gates or Warren Buffett or Ted Turner or Prince Charles, the depopulationist who openly says he wants to call humanity, and his father did as well.
[01:13:19.225 --> 01:13:21.286]  I'm funded by you, so InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:13:23.027 --> 01:13:23.568]  We're good to go.
[01:13:40.851 --> 01:13:44.915]  I'm going to explain this to all the listeners, because I get tons of emails, people on the street say it to me.
[01:13:45.595 --> 01:13:47.697]  It's happened like five times since I've been here in Florida.
[01:13:48.438 --> 01:13:51.761]  And so people in Florida, they come up to me.
[01:13:52.221 --> 01:13:54.223]  It happens all over the country, but I'm just mobbed in Florida.
[01:13:54.423 --> 01:13:56.285]  This is the most awake state anywhere I've been.
[01:13:56.345 --> 01:13:59.308]  I mean, it's just like I'll be out on the beach, not even talking.
[01:13:59.348 --> 01:14:04.612]  And like everybody walking by, I'm on a towel, like almost everybody starts talking to me and saying they're listeners and this and that.
[01:14:04.673 --> 01:14:05.814]  But that's not bragging.
[01:14:05.894 --> 01:14:06.614]  Oh, I'm a big shot.
[01:14:07.856 --> 01:14:08.857]  You're not known.
[01:14:08.897 --> 01:14:11.100]  Your face isn't known, which is a positive thing in many ways.
[01:14:12.001 --> 01:14:12.742]  You're not known.
[01:14:13.403 --> 01:14:17.308]  But other people, like myself or Owen, we're known so we get to see how many people are awake.
[01:14:17.889 --> 01:14:18.970]  And they always come up to me and they say,
[01:14:20.299 --> 01:14:29.286]  They say, hey, I want to promote ban.video, but the URL is blocked on Twitter, on Facebook, on Gmail.
[01:14:30.327 --> 01:14:30.788]  What do we do?
[01:14:30.808 --> 01:14:37.013]  And I say, listen, we've had six different URLs since they started banning our URLs, part of their election meddling eight months ago.
[01:14:37.513 --> 01:14:38.594]  Usually they last about a month.
[01:14:39.054 --> 01:14:47.622]  The last one, banthis.tv, which you can still share on your email or text message if you're not Gmail or by word of mouth, banthis.tv worked for the last four months.
[01:14:47.822 --> 01:14:48.763]  It's now been banned.
[01:14:49.463 --> 01:14:54.307]  And again, Big Tech makes a decision, so platform-wide, over dozens of platforms, it's banned.
[01:14:54.787 --> 01:14:57.450]  The new one is freeworldnews.tv.
[01:14:57.950 --> 01:15:01.413]  They're going to ban that soon, too, and they'll say, hey, did you hear they banned Free World News?
[01:15:01.633 --> 01:15:03.915]  Because they're not for a free world, they're for an enslavement world.
[01:15:04.295 --> 01:15:05.956]  Freeworldnews.tv.
[01:15:06.056 --> 01:15:07.838]  Freeworldnews.tv.
[01:15:07.918 --> 01:15:09.079]  Freeworldnews.tv.
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:11.881]  And that's how you override.
[01:15:12.201 --> 01:15:19.046]  And I know as a core audience that pays attention and cares, you're the detonator on the bomb of awakening that's so peaceful and so powerful.
[01:15:19.526 --> 01:15:21.648]  When you tell everybody, hey, you know Alex Jones, he's censored?
[01:15:21.808 --> 01:15:23.309]  Well, he's at FreeWorldNews.tv.
[01:15:23.629 --> 01:15:25.631]  That's the URL you're able to share right now.
[01:15:26.525 --> 01:15:28.647]  Okay, so freeworldnews.tv.
[01:15:28.747 --> 01:15:29.887]  Share that with everyone you know.
[01:15:30.328 --> 01:15:31.549]  Freeworldnews.tv.
[01:15:31.569 --> 01:15:35.472]  We're going to make some graphics and put them in an activist section of InfoWars.
[01:15:35.492 --> 01:15:41.076]  Hopefully, you'll share those and send people a little digital postcard saying, hey, Alex Jones is censored.
[01:15:41.496 --> 01:15:42.457]  Owen Schroeder is censored.
[01:15:42.737 --> 01:15:43.717]  This other crew is censored.
[01:15:43.777 --> 01:15:44.478]  This is the stuff.
[01:15:45.078 --> 01:15:46.139]  This is the smoking gun.
[01:15:46.259 --> 01:15:46.920]  This is the proof.
[01:15:47.260 --> 01:15:52.344]  So when we post the live video you just saw that's so incredible, to ban that video in an hour or so,
[01:15:53.860 --> 01:16:05.409]  You'll be able to go and get it over the censorship wall of Ted Turner, of Prince Philip, of Prince Charles, of Queen Elizabeth, of Bill Gates, of all these evil people like Klaus Schwab.
[01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:06.650]  So this is a war!
[01:16:06.690 --> 01:16:07.831]  They're literally killing everybody!
[01:16:07.971 --> 01:16:08.912]  But we're going to fight them!
[01:16:08.952 --> 01:16:11.274]  We're going to beat them together at FreeWorldNews.tv!
[01:16:13.151 --> 01:16:16.132]  Just think of the criminal evil that they're involved in to do something like this.
[01:16:16.572 --> 01:16:17.892]  So freeworldnews.tv.
[01:16:17.972 --> 01:16:19.352]  Owen, you're looking great, sounding great.
[01:16:19.672 --> 01:16:20.793]  Love the crew, appreciate everybody.
[01:16:21.093 --> 01:16:26.174]  I'll be back in Austin early tomorrow, and I'll be hosting the Sunday show.
[01:16:26.494 --> 01:16:29.754]  And if you want, Owen, I'll do all four hours, give you a break, but we love you.
[01:16:29.995 --> 01:16:31.415]  And Owen Troyer takes it over to the other side.
[01:16:31.455 --> 01:16:32.535]  Robert Barnes, coming up.
[01:16:33.855 --> 01:16:39.136]  Broadcasting live at freeworldnews.tv.
[01:16:40.417 --> 01:16:41.497]  Owen Troyer sitting in.
[01:16:43.117 --> 01:16:48.298]  I've got some other news I'm going to get to here before Robert Barnes joins us.
[01:16:50.399 --> 01:16:59.421]  Joe Biden helping Russia, giving them clearance to activate that pipeline, and also helping China.
[01:17:00.161 --> 01:17:01.801]  Story is at ZeroHedge.com.
[01:17:02.441 --> 01:17:02.701]  U.S.
[01:17:02.741 --> 01:17:06.422]  stimulus has created a boom in China.
[01:17:07.862 --> 01:17:08.563]  In China.
[01:17:08.663 --> 01:17:09.823]  And in the story here,
[01:17:12.619 --> 01:17:14.479]  Very heavily sourced.
[01:17:15.980 --> 01:17:20.321]  Just showing how the economic boom has come to China, while the U.S.
[01:17:20.841 --> 01:17:23.321]  is having a problem.
[01:17:24.442 --> 01:17:34.624]  And stimulus and the Fed printing, which is just counterfeit, is a false solution, or maybe what some might call a bubble that will burst.
[01:17:37.004 --> 01:17:41.085]  It's not actual GDP, it's just counterfeit bills that the Fed is printing.
[01:17:43.186 --> 01:17:45.808]  So China and Russia both love Joe Biden.
[01:17:45.868 --> 01:17:53.054]  They have the Biden family by the balls because of all the corruption that the Bidens have engaged in.
[01:17:53.074 --> 01:17:53.735]  But they don't mind.
[01:17:53.915 --> 01:17:54.435]  They don't mind.
[01:17:55.576 --> 01:17:56.877]  No, they don't mind.
[01:17:58.579 --> 01:18:05.585]  Six Republicans have been hit with a $500 fine for going without masks in the House chamber.
[01:18:05.645 --> 01:18:09.048]  That's a mask policy from Nancy Pelosi.
[01:18:10.632 --> 01:18:13.513]  And if they get another one, it'll be a $2,500 fine.
[01:18:13.554 --> 01:18:15.494]  And actually, I think Massey may have got that.
[01:18:17.075 --> 01:18:20.637]  Ralph Norman is one who's been fined $500.
[01:18:23.078 --> 01:18:24.479]  But I believe it was Massey.
[01:18:25.059 --> 01:18:30.042]  I don't have the tweet in front of me, but Massey said he received a second citation from Pelosi.
[01:18:30.382 --> 01:18:31.823]  He filed it the same as the first.
[01:18:31.863 --> 01:18:32.643]  He threw it in the trash.
[01:18:34.484 --> 01:18:39.987]  So Pelosi is a masked Nazi, fining members of Congress who want to wear a mask.
[01:18:41.374 --> 01:18:42.856]  This is Democrat Party policy.
[01:18:42.916 --> 01:18:48.863]  Police arrest unmasked attendee at maskless group shows up at Timberlane School meeting.
[01:18:49.764 --> 01:18:53.369]  And so the reason why they really want the mask to be so enforced...
[01:18:55.288 --> 01:19:06.736]  Is so that they can come in with the vaccine and say that you're out so that you don't have to wear the mask is you get forced to take the vaccine or you have to take the vaccine to go back to work or church or whatever it is.
[01:19:07.176 --> 01:19:20.365]  So even though the science on masks is obviously that they don't work and if you're vaccinated you don't need to worry about getting infected, of course that's a lie too, the vaccine isn't effective, but that's what they're selling, that's what they're told to believe.
[01:19:21.578 --> 01:19:23.760]  But you still have to wear a mask.
[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:26.142]  You still have to live under Democrat tyranny.
[01:19:27.643 --> 01:19:30.045]  And then a poll in Rasmussen.
[01:19:32.687 --> 01:19:35.729]  Republicans happiest about end of mask mandate.
[01:19:35.809 --> 01:19:36.409]  Yeah, go figure.
[01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:38.651]  Liberals love their mask.
[01:19:39.011 --> 01:19:39.852]  They love it.
[01:19:39.972 --> 01:19:40.873]  They really do.
[01:19:41.674 --> 01:19:46.717]  And it's, of course, Republicans that are getting all the fines for not wearing the masks in Congress.
[01:19:47.638 --> 01:19:49.720]  Because they don't want to wear the masks.
[01:19:50.794 --> 01:19:53.015]  Where the Democrats do.
[01:19:53.595 --> 01:19:59.698]  They like being good slaves because it's all a virtue signal to trick you into being a good slave like them.
[01:20:01.278 --> 01:20:02.279]  But we don't fall for it.
[01:20:02.579 --> 01:20:09.022]  It'll be interesting to see if Pelosi forces them to pay those fines or not.
[01:20:10.322 --> 01:20:12.083]  That will be interesting.
[01:20:13.649 --> 01:20:17.270]  We do have, you know what, let me get into that in the short segment before Bob joins us at 1.06.
[01:20:18.110 --> 01:20:19.611]  Let me just finish off the rest of this news.
[01:20:20.071 --> 01:20:31.033]  Feds accidentally seized computer belonging to Rudy Giuliani's ex-wife during New York City raid, but didn't have any interest in the Hunter Biden laptop or hard drives.
[01:20:31.133 --> 01:20:32.634]  Left that one behind.
[01:20:33.674 --> 01:20:36.895]  They don't want to see what Hunter Biden is up to.
[01:20:38.134 --> 01:20:43.979]  They don't want to investigate the Bidens, and they know if they took that laptop, then they'd have to have a criminal investigation into the Bidens, so they didn't.
[01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:59.291]  More videos are now surfacing of Capitol Police waving protesters inside, moving barricades aside, and standing by as protesters walk in, and even engaging in polite conversations with them, trying to work together at the scene there on January 6th.
[01:20:59.371 --> 01:21:04.856]  But don't let that get in the way of a good Democrat mainstream media lie and narrative.
[01:21:06.158 --> 01:21:08.620]  Like the one they're telling now about January 6th.
[01:21:11.922 --> 01:21:20.008]  Netflix CEO Reed Hastings gives $3 million to beat Gavin Newsom recall.
[01:21:21.770 --> 01:21:22.851]  Still paying for Netflix?
[01:21:26.053 --> 01:21:27.134]  Still paying for Netflix?
[01:21:27.274 --> 01:21:33.759]  Your money just went to the legal defense of Governor Gavin Newsom.
[01:21:35.694 --> 01:21:40.378]  The fascistic, totalitarian dictator of California.
[01:21:40.739 --> 01:21:42.801]  Three million dollars from Netflix CEO.
[01:21:44.362 --> 01:21:46.264]  Still have a Netflix subscription?
[01:21:48.026 --> 01:21:56.654]  CNN's Chris Cuomo participated in strategy calls to help his brother Andrew Cuomo cover up sexual harassment scandal.
[01:21:57.435 --> 01:21:59.416]  And the phone calls were really short.
[01:22:00.313 --> 01:22:04.417]  Andrew called Chris, said, Chris, I got all these women coming forward about my harassing them.
[01:22:04.757 --> 01:22:05.337]  What should I do?
[01:22:05.437 --> 01:22:07.039]  Chris says, just join the Democrat Party.
[01:22:07.079 --> 01:22:08.500]  Cuomo says, I'm already a Democrat.
[01:22:08.740 --> 01:22:09.761]  He says, end of conversation.
[01:22:09.781 --> 01:22:10.382]  You're good, bro.
[01:22:11.743 --> 01:22:12.764]  You're good, bro.
[01:22:13.604 --> 01:22:16.227]  And once again, just the madness at the Washington Post.
[01:22:17.748 --> 01:22:21.051]  I'm telling you, I mean, look, we see all kinds of outrageous stuff, but this is just
[01:22:22.423 --> 01:22:26.305]  Democrats, liberals, leftists, whatever you want to call them, they don't live in reality.
[01:22:26.505 --> 01:22:31.407]  They have their own visions of reality in their head, and this is why they're lost in a world that doesn't exist.
[01:22:31.767 --> 01:22:33.508]  This is why they're mental basket cases.
[01:22:33.548 --> 01:22:35.869]  This is why they belong in straitjackets and rubber rooms.
[01:22:36.650 --> 01:22:43.673]  This is why more than a third of Democrat voters and polls say they've been diagnosed with a mental disorder.
[01:22:43.893 --> 01:22:44.653]  They're sick people.
[01:22:44.693 --> 01:22:45.354]  They're really sick.
[01:22:46.074 --> 01:22:47.695]  They're lost in a world that doesn't exist.
[01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:54.765]  And they write about it in the Washington Post and they call, here's the headline, Mexicans' coronavirus deaths are plummeting.
[01:22:54.885 --> 01:22:57.387]  The Biden wall could be a factor.
[01:22:57.487 --> 01:22:58.288]  The Biden wall.
[01:22:58.348 --> 01:22:58.948]  Can you imagine?
[01:22:59.549 --> 01:23:02.391]  For four years they bashed Trump, said his wall was racist.
[01:23:02.591 --> 01:23:04.313]  Now it's the Biden wall and it's a good thing.
[01:23:05.785 --> 01:23:11.047]  And not only that, in the story, she gives Biden credit for Operation Warp Speed.
[01:23:11.427 --> 01:23:12.247]  I'm not even kidding you.
[01:23:12.648 --> 01:23:15.229]  These people live in a world that doesn't exist.
[01:23:15.709 --> 01:23:23.572]  And that's why the media and the Democrats know that they can get away with anything, and as long as they're in the Democrat Party, the media won't say a thing.
[01:23:23.852 --> 01:23:26.753]  Because they're so filled with hate, they're so blind by hate,
[01:23:27.273 --> 01:23:30.534]  For their opposition that they can't even see within themselves.
[01:23:30.554 --> 01:23:32.175]  They can't even see within their own party.
[01:23:32.215 --> 01:23:34.015]  They can't even see within their own ideologies.
[01:23:34.255 --> 01:23:36.196]  They can't even see reality.
[01:23:37.276 --> 01:23:40.738]  They see a wall at the southern border and they see COVID cases going down to Mexico.
[01:23:40.778 --> 01:23:42.118]  They say, good job, Biden!
[01:23:42.158 --> 01:23:42.798]  Way to go!
[01:23:44.799 --> 01:23:47.880]  That's how deranged these people are.
[01:23:50.424 --> 01:23:55.028]  Kellogg CEO, we are battling inflation like everybody else.
[01:23:55.048 --> 01:23:57.370]  So yeah, you know, food prices are going up.
[01:23:57.430 --> 01:24:01.935]  Kellogg owns a big, you know, food industry with their cereals and snacks and everything.
[01:24:03.636 --> 01:24:06.999]  And so their food prices are going up and they're being questioned, why are your food prices going up?
[01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:09.522]  Kellogg CEO says, our prices are going up.
[01:24:10.282 --> 01:24:11.944]  We're battling inflation just like everybody else.
[01:24:12.264 --> 01:24:12.464]  Yeah.
[01:24:14.636 --> 01:24:24.964]  The COVID weapon, the weaponization of the flu by our own government, by the World Health Organization, by the CDC, by the Democrats, has crashed our economy and caused prices to go up.
[01:24:25.224 --> 01:24:29.027]  And now they've printed a bunch of counterfeit money which will cause inflation.
[01:24:34.851 --> 01:24:36.513]  You know what's so frustrating about this?
[01:24:39.555 --> 01:24:40.696]  Trying to remain calm here.
[01:24:43.166 --> 01:24:44.687]  You know what's so frustrating about all this?
[01:24:46.568 --> 01:24:48.470]  And they should admit this, but they'll never admit it.
[01:24:50.831 --> 01:24:56.055]  We should have never, you know this, but we should have never shut down anything.
[01:24:57.276 --> 01:25:00.738]  We should have never shut down anything.
[01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:06.122]  And we should be having that conversation right now.
[01:25:08.027 --> 01:25:16.433]  We should be sitting here reflecting on this if we were a sane functioning civilization, a higher civilization as we like to think we are.
[01:25:16.813 --> 01:25:21.696]  We would be sitting down and having this real conversation and debate that we should have never done this.
[01:25:22.717 --> 01:25:23.797]  It was all a huge mistake.
[01:25:25.018 --> 01:25:25.499]  But we're not.
[01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:28.160]  We're not having that conversation.
[01:25:29.021 --> 01:25:36.446]  Even though we can look back on it now, if you're a fair neutral observer, you can look back on it now and say unequivocally,
[01:25:37.537 --> 01:25:39.337]  We should have never shut anything down.
[01:25:42.358 --> 01:25:49.099]  But it's not just frustrating that we can see that in hindsight and nobody will have the conversation.
[01:25:49.699 --> 01:25:52.280]  It's frustrating that we knew it then!
[01:25:53.100 --> 01:25:54.560]  We knew it then!
[01:25:56.621 --> 01:25:58.321]  We believed in freedom then!
[01:25:59.061 --> 01:26:03.582]  We knew that this would crash the economy and create medical tyranny then!
[01:26:05.083 --> 01:26:06.403]  We knew it then!
[01:26:07.677 --> 01:26:08.718]  And they still did it.
[01:26:10.499 --> 01:26:11.619]  They still did it to us.
[01:26:13.621 --> 01:26:20.265]  These criminals, these crooks, these communists, these sellouts, these phonies, these traitors.
[01:26:22.426 --> 01:26:26.609]  And now we're sitting here in the aftermath of their fake pandemic.
[01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:44.203]  With their lab-made virus given to China to be released by Obama and Fauci that's been crashing China's economic adversaries and we should have never shut down and we now know it in hindsight and we still won't be honest about it.
[01:26:44.643 --> 01:26:48.364]  And we're letting them shut us down and mask us up and vaccinate us now.
[01:26:50.165 --> 01:26:57.006]  Ladies and gentlemen, the decades-old, centuries-old, millennia-old
[01:26:58.709 --> 01:27:04.714]  Fighting in the Middle East has now come to our backyard, unfortunately.
[01:27:05.675 --> 01:27:07.537]  It's not what we wanted to see, but it's here now.
[01:27:08.257 --> 01:27:13.922]  And it has the same dichotomy, it has the same elements of the left versus the right.
[01:27:14.623 --> 01:27:17.105]  The anti-Americans versus the Americans.
[01:27:17.225 --> 01:27:19.347]  The Trump supporters versus the Trump haters.
[01:27:20.468 --> 01:27:24.412]  And so, these political lines are drawn so deep now.
[01:27:25.563 --> 01:27:28.986]  That everything becomes drawn on the same line.
[01:27:30.127 --> 01:27:40.075]  So now it's Jews versus Palestinians or whatever the heck this is going on in New York City and Los Angeles and Chicago and across the nation and we're just gonna be rolling b-roll of all this.
[01:27:40.275 --> 01:27:44.078]  There's a lot of cussing and everything so we're just gonna roll the b-roll as I'm covering this.
[01:27:44.479 --> 01:27:52.786]  But this is all in American cities between Jews and Palestinians and then of course you have Jewish people being stalked and beaten all in these cities as well.
[01:27:56.389 --> 01:28:01.413]  Remember how they called Trump supporters anti-Semitic for years?
[01:28:01.453 --> 01:28:02.073]  Remember all that?
[01:28:02.534 --> 01:28:10.180]  But even in this hyper-politicized age, it's Trump supporters and pro-Israel people on the same side?
[01:28:12.950 --> 01:28:14.790]  And it's always the left being violent.
[01:28:14.870 --> 01:28:21.351]  So in this case, the left is the pro-Palestinian groups that are attacking Jewish people all around New York City and California and others.
[01:28:22.092 --> 01:28:22.972]  Committing hate crimes.
[01:28:23.332 --> 01:28:25.372]  So again, it's the left committing hate crimes.
[01:28:25.432 --> 01:28:28.493]  Again, it's the intolerant, violent left.
[01:28:29.253 --> 01:28:29.833]  Every time.
[01:28:30.053 --> 01:28:30.753]  It's the left.
[01:28:31.033 --> 01:28:35.114]  Now look, I don't even think that that's a real fair analysis.
[01:28:35.134 --> 01:28:36.694]  Because it's not left versus right.
[01:28:36.714 --> 01:28:39.034]  This is a totally separate geopolitical issue.
[01:28:39.394 --> 01:28:42.675]  It's been here long before the American left-right paradigm ever existed.
[01:28:46.519 --> 01:28:47.980]  But it's now the same thing.
[01:28:48.300 --> 01:28:53.523]  It's now the same line being drawn and the same sides being chosen.
[01:28:54.224 --> 01:29:05.611]  So it's completely not relevant to the left-right political paradigm, but now it is because it's in our backyards and it's pretty much the left that's the pro-Palestinians and the right that's pro-Israel.
[01:29:06.352 --> 01:29:10.854]  If you could boil it down to such a lowest common denominator breakdown.
[01:29:12.315 --> 01:29:12.996]  So that's what it is.
[01:29:14.107 --> 01:29:22.693]  But it's Jewish people being stalked and having hate crimes committed against them.
[01:29:27.176 --> 01:29:32.480]  And so again, it's New York City where there's a very large Jewish population and they get stalked.
[01:29:34.422 --> 01:29:37.804]  The left sees people wearing, you know, Jewish garbs.
[01:29:37.844 --> 01:29:41.847]  They get attacked and stalked and insulted and shouted out and called terrorists.
[01:29:42.207 --> 01:29:42.968]  That's the left.
[01:29:44.326 --> 01:29:49.169]  But again, remember it was the Democrat Party saying Trump supporters were anti-Semitic.
[01:29:49.529 --> 01:29:54.051]  They went in front of Congress during hearings saying Trump supporters are anti-Semitic.
[01:29:54.592 --> 01:29:58.034]  Ranting and raving about how Trump supporters are racist and anti-Semitic.
[01:29:58.394 --> 01:30:11.001]  But now here is the modern day left, pro-Hamas, anti-Israel, anti-Semitic, attacking Jews in the streets of America.
[01:30:12.181 --> 01:30:13.142]  So this is just great.
[01:30:16.121 --> 01:30:27.285]  But again, just like we should have been honest and said we should have never locked down, we should be honest about this and say, no, it's the left that's anti-Semitic.
[01:30:27.845 --> 01:30:37.328]  Imagine a Democrat Party with the likes of Rashida Tlaib, a quote-unquote Palestinian-born member of Congress,
[01:30:39.321 --> 01:30:53.929]  Imagine having the likes of that wicked devil, and Alexandria Cortez, and Ilhan Omar, who are all openly anti-Semitic, openly anti-Israel, openly pro-genocide of Jews.
[01:30:54.229 --> 01:30:56.351]  They're openly, that's their open stance.
[01:30:57.031 --> 01:30:58.872]  Very, very in line with Hitler.
[01:30:59.492 --> 01:31:05.576]  But they go in front of Congress, and they go on TV, and they say, you're Hitler, you're anti-Semitic,
[01:31:07.308 --> 01:31:12.551]  As they put wind in the sails of groups of people that want to exterminate the Jews.
[01:31:14.733 --> 01:31:23.218]  And they don't even have the own, they don't even have awareness, they don't have the self-awareness, they can't even see themselves in the mirror because they're like vampires apparently.
[01:31:24.719 --> 01:31:30.222]  So they'll point the finger and say anti-Semite and then cheer on the crowd that wants to exterminate the Jews.
[01:31:30.502 --> 01:31:31.503]  That's the Democrats.
[01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:50.871]  And we're going to be joined by Bob Barnes here shortly, who, by the way, next week will be debating Nick Fuentes on the clash of Palestinians and Israelis or the Middle East in crisis, whatever you want to call that.
[01:31:51.692 --> 01:31:57.475]  But that is next Tuesday, the Great Debate, Barnes and Fuentes at GreatDebateNews.com.
[01:31:57.495 --> 01:31:59.537]  Of course, this is the Alex Jones Show, streaming live at
[01:32:00.623 --> 01:32:03.065]  FreeWorldNews.tv.
[01:32:03.125 --> 01:32:05.187]  That's FreeWorldNews.tv.
[01:32:06.708 --> 01:32:08.049]  I'm not going to talk about this anymore.
[01:32:08.509 --> 01:32:18.476]  We'll maybe get into a little bit with Bob Barnes, but I kind of did my long breakdown and gave my opinions on a recording I did for my Subscribestar.
[01:32:18.957 --> 01:32:25.662]  So if you want to get my long-form take on that, it's on my Subscribestar account, but I don't want to do a long-form take here on this show.
[01:32:25.902 --> 01:32:28.164]  I think there's more important things for us to get to, quite frankly.
[01:32:28.864 --> 01:32:32.305]  But we will be having that debate, and it's always got to be InfoWars.
[01:32:32.345 --> 01:32:34.186]  We should be having political debates every night.
[01:32:34.866 --> 01:32:38.607]  It shouldn't just be InfoWars trying to find the people that are willing to have the debates.
[01:32:38.627 --> 01:32:45.529]  I mean, Nick Fuentes, you know, all these people love talking trash, and then he says, hey, let's have a debate, and then they block him, like Dave Rubin.
[01:32:46.849 --> 01:32:50.910]  AOC agreed to debate Marjorie Taylor Greene and then cancelled.
[01:32:51.410 --> 01:32:54.131]  They cancelled all the presidential debates because Joe Biden can't think.
[01:32:55.663 --> 01:33:03.545]  But, I mean, considering the times we're in and how important and polarized these political issues are, we should be seeing debates every night!
[01:33:04.105 --> 01:33:08.227]  Media people, politicians, historians, lawyers, doctors!
[01:33:08.267 --> 01:33:09.767]  I mean, we should be having it every night!
[01:33:09.787 --> 01:33:11.087]  This is what America needs!
[01:33:11.468 --> 01:33:12.808]  But we don't get any of that!
[01:33:13.508 --> 01:33:16.349]  So we'll try to fill that void, too, here at InfoWars.
[01:33:16.969 --> 01:33:18.210]  And we'll be doing that next Tuesday.
[01:33:18.230 --> 01:33:22.311]  Of course, that will also be streaming at freeworldnews.tv, as well as Great Debate.
[01:33:24.239 --> 01:33:39.504]  Before we're joined by Bob Barnes to talk about the COVID vaccine mandates and how illegal those are and the litigation he's going to be involved in to try to stop that, everything we do here is possible with your support at InfoWarsTore.com.

[01:34:38.077 --> 01:34:39.558]  We've got some reviews at the website.
[01:34:39.578 --> 01:34:43.662]  It's a brand-new product, but we do have a couple of reviews, and they're also five-star.
[01:34:44.747 --> 01:34:46.428]  So, it's InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:34:46.448 --> 01:34:47.789]  People always ask, how can I support?
[01:34:47.809 --> 01:34:48.249]  What can I do?
[01:34:48.289 --> 01:34:53.572]  Well, your prayers, sharing the links, and if you can, support us financially at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:34:53.592 --> 01:34:55.013]  But these are supplements you need, folks.
[01:34:55.393 --> 01:34:57.014]  They're great for your health.
[01:34:57.775 --> 01:35:01.156]  Alright, guys, is Bob with us yet, actually?
[01:35:01.217 --> 01:35:02.477]  Do we know if Bob is with us yet?
[01:35:03.358 --> 01:35:04.518]  Okay, Bob is not ready yet.
[01:35:04.638 --> 01:35:07.720]  Alright, I have a couple other news stories I can get to here until he joins me.
[01:35:08.841 --> 01:35:10.522]  I'll tell you though, this is the weirdest thing.
[01:35:12.145 --> 01:35:14.908]  Where did my Great Debate promo sheet go?
[01:35:14.968 --> 01:35:16.069]  I have not moved.
[01:35:16.629 --> 01:35:18.631]  I literally... Folks think it's the craziest thing.
[01:35:19.052 --> 01:35:22.375]  Alex is in here and we have these stacks of papers like, I can't find the story, I can't find my story.
[01:35:22.395 --> 01:35:23.936]  People are probably listening like, what are you, insane?
[01:35:24.377 --> 01:35:25.778]  You're sitting at a desk, you don't even move.
[01:35:26.258 --> 01:35:29.481]  How did I lose that piece of paper in 30 seconds?
[01:35:29.622 --> 01:35:31.704]  I mean, it is like, gone, man.
[01:35:33.786 --> 01:35:35.727]  It's the craziest thing sometimes, the desk.
[01:35:36.621 --> 01:35:39.963]  Just eats papers, I guess.
[01:35:40.003 --> 01:35:40.583]  I don't know where it is.
[01:35:40.723 --> 01:35:43.364]  Alright, well that's neither here nor there.
[01:35:43.404 --> 01:35:45.545]  Let me get to some of this other news before Bob Barnes joins us.
[01:35:46.966 --> 01:35:48.027]  You know, this is so key.
[01:35:48.127 --> 01:35:50.448]  More developments in the vote audits happening.
[01:35:50.928 --> 01:35:52.309]  But this is the real key right here.
[01:35:52.889 --> 01:35:58.892]  It shows how it was all pre-planned out to steal the Maricopa County presidential election from Trump.
[01:36:00.273 --> 01:36:08.661]  And now we not only know that Soros was paying the sheriff who's stopping a lot of this from happening, they also had to replace a pro-Trump sheriff.
[01:36:08.681 --> 01:36:09.903]  But Bob Barnes is ready to go now.
[01:36:09.963 --> 01:36:11.504]  So here's the story.
[01:36:12.445 --> 01:36:13.486]  Robert Barnes joins us.
[01:36:13.987 --> 01:36:15.789]  Oregon, California, New York.
[01:36:16.329 --> 01:36:29.950]  ...are having a soft implementation of mandatory vaccines, like, oh, we won't go door-to-door and force you to take a needle, but if you want to go to work, if you want to go to church, if you want to get on the subway, if you want to go to dinner, if you want to go to the grocery store, so just all your essential activities, you're going to need a vaccine for that.
[01:36:29.970 --> 01:36:31.753]  But, oh, they're not mandatory, though!
[01:36:35.174 --> 01:36:42.900]  Yeah, I mean, I think what we're witnessing is a range of both employers and educational institutions are trying to impose a mandate on it.
[01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:52.927]  And so Robert Kennedy's group, Children's Health Defense, started drafting some objections and legal claims and examples of what letters might look like.
[01:36:53.347 --> 01:36:54.308]  And I did the same thing.
[01:36:55.068 --> 01:37:02.832]  So I drafted a letter that reflects what an employee could object to and it's not legal advice or anything like that.
[01:37:02.872 --> 01:37:09.475]  It's basically just here's what the objections that could be made that other employees have been making and that I believe is the legally correct.
[01:37:10.435 --> 01:37:19.182]  Objection to be made because the nature of this COVID-19 vaccine at this point is still an emergency use authorization vaccine.
[01:37:19.222 --> 01:37:24.665]  It is not a regular FDA clinical trial approved vaccine.
[01:37:25.206 --> 01:37:29.289]  Consequently, under federal law, that cannot be mandated period.
[01:37:29.769 --> 01:37:38.635]  The precondition of it even being distributed and being authorized is that it not be mandated without informed consent.
[01:37:40.016 --> 01:37:45.418]  Part one of the objection is that it really violates the Americans with Disabilities Act.
[01:37:45.959 --> 01:37:53.642]  Because the Americans with Disabilities Act makes clear that you cannot do certain medical examinations except when business necessity compels it.
[01:37:54.182 --> 01:38:00.605]  You cannot compel people to provide medical information aside from when there's some public business necessity.
[01:38:01.652 --> 01:38:03.834]  And in this context, that has not yet been met.
[01:38:04.374 --> 01:38:19.145]  And so they don't have clear and convincing evidence that being vaccinated is critical and essential to reducing a substantial risk to others of transmitting COVID-19 in such a way that can cause severe bodily harm without the COVID vaccine.
[01:38:19.705 --> 01:38:26.570]  And so in almost every instance, one can make reasonable accommodations to limit whatever that risk they believe is.
[01:38:26.970 --> 01:38:29.052]  But right now, there's inadequate data and evidence
[01:38:29.612 --> 01:38:35.358]  Either that the vaccine is safe and effective in the sense that it has not yet met FDA clinical trial test standards.
[01:38:35.838 --> 01:38:47.349]  We have reasons to be skeptical and suspect of the vaccine because the makers of it and the distributors of it are completely immune from liability in case they've done something wrong or have a bad product.
[01:38:48.004 --> 01:38:56.854]  We have other reasons to be suspect of it because the media and YouTube and social media are basically censoring and suppressing the information.
[01:38:56.874 --> 01:38:58.316]  Let me just interject one point too.
[01:38:58.596 --> 01:39:07.046]  The companies that are making this vaccine, manufacturing it, have paid out the record highest payouts for health fraud violations.
[01:39:09.284 --> 01:39:10.325]  Yeah, I mean, no question.
[01:39:10.365 --> 01:39:13.468]  I mean, you have every reason to distrust it.
[01:39:14.168 --> 01:39:18.572]  If we're going to trust a vaccine, first, at least it should meet FDA clinical trial testing.
[01:39:18.612 --> 01:39:20.133]  This one's nowhere close to it.
[01:39:20.173 --> 01:39:20.994]  That's years away.
[01:39:21.474 --> 01:39:26.739]  But it should not be an emergency use authorized vaccine that could ever be mandated against us.
[01:39:26.799 --> 01:39:37.448]  And that goes to not only does federal law prohibit that under the Americans with Disabilities Act and under the emergency use authorization provisions of the very act that authorized the FDA in the first place,
[01:39:37.868 --> 01:39:47.411]  But it violates international law that has become part of American law because it was created and instigated and pushed on the rest of the world by the United States, which is the Nuremberg Code of 1947.
[01:39:49.092 --> 01:39:56.254]  And the federal courts have recognized that the Nuremberg Code of 1947 is enforceable in the United States courts.
[01:39:56.714 --> 01:39:58.595]  In fact, this last time this happened,
[01:39:59.190 --> 01:39:59.910]  We're good.
[01:40:16.636 --> 01:40:17.397]  We're good to go.
[01:40:42.475 --> 01:40:44.436]  We'll be right back with Robert Barnes at FreeWorldNews.tv.
[01:41:10.930 --> 01:41:16.694]  We're back here on the Alex Jones Show, broadcasting live at FreeWorldNews.tv.
[01:41:18.915 --> 01:41:34.025]  Bob Barnes is with us, and we're discussing how in California, Oregon, New York, and other places soon, I'm sure, are saying you have to be vaccinated to go back to work or go to church, but we're not forcing you to do it.
[01:41:34.065 --> 01:41:36.386]  Just anywhere you go to leave your house, you have to have it.
[01:41:36.726 --> 01:41:37.647]  But we're not forcing you.
[01:41:39.088 --> 01:41:49.780]  And so, Bob, you have just put up a letter there that's free to use, not legal advice, but just ways people can stand up for their rights and know the law when it comes to these forced vaccines.
[01:41:49.820 --> 01:41:52.543]  But let's talk about potential litigation here.
[01:41:52.563 --> 01:41:57.107]  I mean, there's so many ways that this can go, and there's going to be real world, like,
[01:41:57.768 --> 01:42:03.573]  Peer-to-peer interactions that are going to become really awkward, I think, from this, but we'll get to that later.
[01:42:04.514 --> 01:42:06.656]  What happens when they really start rolling this out?
[01:42:06.716 --> 01:42:12.502]  What happens when employers force their employees to take this vaccine illegally?
[01:42:12.982 --> 01:42:13.863]  What happens then?
[01:42:14.203 --> 01:42:15.965]  What happens when the litigation starts flying?
[01:42:17.845 --> 01:42:19.667]  Well, I think that's where the first step is.
[01:42:20.347 --> 01:42:37.622]  If somebody's out there and their college, their school, their state, their county, their employer is saying they have to take the vaccine and are demanding the disclosure of whether they've taken it, I think the first step is sending back a letter like this because that will put them on notice and see how they respond.
[01:42:37.762 --> 01:42:45.349]  A lot of employers don't know that the emergency use authorization law does not authorize them to mandate a vaccine.
[01:42:45.949 --> 01:42:51.755]  Most employers do not know that the Nuremberg Code is invoked because this is an experimental vaccine.
[01:42:52.396 --> 01:43:03.947]  Most employers do not know that the Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits them from asking questions about people's medical information unless there's business necessity for it.
[01:43:04.443 --> 01:43:11.047]  Basically, the legal standard for and under the ADA for when, like some people are getting confused because they think HIPAA applies.
[01:43:11.447 --> 01:43:16.510]  HIPAA applies to what an employer can do with your medical information, not how it gathers it.
[01:43:17.370 --> 01:43:26.895]  It's the ADA, the Americans with Disabilities Act, that precludes your employer from going out and asking questions about your medical information.
[01:43:27.256 --> 01:43:31.438]  And unfortunately, there's a lot of bad lawyers out there or lawyers that are politically motivated.
[01:43:31.898 --> 01:43:36.360]  Telling people that, oh, there's no problem with this, when clearly there's a problem with this.
[01:43:36.820 --> 01:43:43.443]  Even the CDC and OSHA and the EEOC, when they issued various guidances, they've said to be careful in this space.
[01:43:43.963 --> 01:44:00.431]  But employers are, a lot of lawyers, because they love the vaccine, because they're, you know, Bill Gates fan club types, Trump hater types, forced vaccine fans, just like the crowd that supported eugenics in the 20s and 30s, a lot of lawyers and doctors in that space.
[01:44:01.311 --> 01:44:13.496]  Are misstating the law and so the first step for people is to get educated on the law The second step is to push back by just asking letter putting in information like this in a letter To your employer to anyone else.
[01:44:13.516 --> 01:44:21.839]  You don't have to hire a lawyer for it You can just say hey, this is my understanding and and make sure the employer probably this would be the first time they've heard of this
[01:44:22.659 --> 01:44:44.464]  The other big thing is, employers don't realize, not only could they be sued under various tort theories and invasions of privacy under state law, but on top of this, even the CDC has come out and said, by the way employers, if you mandate the vaccine and the person, your employee suffers any injury from it, you are liable.
[01:44:44.972 --> 01:44:55.157]  So unlike the drug companies are off the hook because of special immunity, employers are not off the hook if they require people to take the vaccine and they suffer any medical injury.
[01:44:55.197 --> 01:44:56.597]  They could be on the hook for life.
[01:44:56.898 --> 01:44:58.758]  They could be on the hook for wrongful death claims.
[01:44:59.038 --> 01:45:01.560]  They could be on the hook for lifetime injury claims.
[01:45:02.020 --> 01:45:05.181]  So almost no employer realizes this.
[01:45:05.421 --> 01:45:06.862]  No, this is actually so key.
[01:45:07.062 --> 01:45:10.484]  And this is the official statement from the government and OSHA and everything.
[01:45:11.204 --> 01:45:16.061]  And to draw back on that, it's kind of like the same dynamic of if somebody went to get a vaccine...
[01:45:17.288 --> 01:45:21.930]  And the people distributing the vaccine were going to be held liable for any damages, then maybe they won't distribute it.
[01:45:21.950 --> 01:45:23.511]  But you don't have that same dynamic here.
[01:45:23.931 --> 01:45:24.911]  What you have is the employer.
[01:45:24.951 --> 01:45:28.833]  Now, kind of a reroute, though.
[01:45:29.353 --> 01:45:31.354]  This will be another way to crush small businesses.
[01:45:31.794 --> 01:45:33.855]  Small businesses won't be able to handle this litigation.
[01:45:33.875 --> 01:45:40.097]  They won't be able to handle these lawsuits, whereas big businesses maybe can or will somehow be grandfathered into some exemption clause.
[01:45:40.378 --> 01:45:45.960]  So there's like another slash waiting to happen when this goes down.
[01:45:47.301 --> 01:45:50.764]  Well, that's why every employer out there should not be mandating this.
[01:45:50.824 --> 01:45:52.426]  All the risk is on them.
[01:45:52.766 --> 01:46:09.440]  They're taking on risk of ADA lawsuits, risk of violating informed consent, invasion of privacy lawsuits, risk of wrongful termination, violation of public policy lawsuits, and significantly huge tail liability if anybody suffers any adverse consequence from this vaccine.
[01:46:09.721 --> 01:46:13.284]  And remember, a lot of times the adverse consequences from it don't appear until years later.
[01:46:13.864 --> 01:46:14.785]  That's the nature of this.
[01:46:14.845 --> 01:46:20.367]  So if you're an employer, you're crazy to mandate a vaccine as a condition of employment.
[01:46:20.768 --> 01:46:25.190]  So that's where the and I think that's that's the first step is a once and forward.
[01:46:25.890 --> 01:46:27.931]  Employees and employers are informed.
[01:46:28.411 --> 01:46:31.593]  I think a lot of employers will step back and not force this.
[01:46:31.673 --> 01:46:35.875]  Now, if they do, then you get to the second stage of potential litigation.
[01:46:36.515 --> 01:46:40.278]  And at this point they are not immune by mandating vaccines.
[01:46:40.739 --> 01:46:55.770]  Many states have passed laws prohibiting employers or anybody from requiring vaccines as a condition of access to employment, condition of access to travel, condition of access to entertainment, condition of access to education.
[01:46:56.190 --> 01:47:03.916]  So now the states that are trying to compel it, trying to require it, that's going to be a major constitutional battle to come.
[01:47:04.873 --> 01:47:17.710]  So the because the while the Supreme Court has approved mandatory vaccines on condition of a fine in one case in 1905 the Jacobson decision in a later children's school vaccine case.
[01:47:18.300 --> 01:47:25.869]  They've always allowed exemptions to be present for religion and other reasons, and they've also required, always required, a strict evidentiary standard.
[01:47:26.790 --> 01:47:36.122]  It has to be clear and convincing evidence that the vaccine is safe and effective, and that it prevents a substantial risk
[01:47:36.702 --> 01:47:39.263]  of severe health injury to others.
[01:47:39.723 --> 01:47:41.283]  It can't just be to protect the person.
[01:47:41.583 --> 01:47:51.726]  It has to be that this vaccine reduces transmission at such a rate that it is going to be a substantial benefit at reducing severe bodily harm.
[01:47:52.146 --> 01:47:53.907]  And they don't have clear and convincing evidence of that.
[01:47:54.327 --> 01:47:56.968]  So that's where, you know, that's where that litigation is going to go.
[01:47:57.028 --> 01:48:05.790]  That's where we're going to contest it, try to establish, reestablish the Nuremberg Principles in the context of states or federal governments mandating this, because then that's a constitutional question.
[01:48:06.210 --> 01:48:14.455]  Right now it's a question under the ADA, a question under the Emergency Use Authorization Act, a question under invasion of privacy laws, a question under the Nuremberg Code.
[01:48:15.015 --> 01:48:21.639]  If a governmental actor requires it, the Nuremberg Code comes back into play, but also the Constitution of the United States.
[01:48:22.099 --> 01:48:34.846]  And I believe we can show there is not clear and convincing evidence that a vaccine provides a substantial reduction in the risk of severe bodily injury simply by reducing the risk of transmission.
[01:48:35.226 --> 01:48:36.307]  Because let's just look at it.
[01:48:36.367 --> 01:48:57.181]  Aside from the big questions about whether the vaccine is safe and effective, be given it's still an emergency experimental stage, given that the very nature of this vaccine is experimental and it's mRNA technology for many of the vaccines, given the controversy surrounding this vaccine in terms of coronavirus vaccines having no history of success, there's all of those problems, but to the just question of transmission.
[01:48:57.681 --> 01:49:06.314]  The probability, the only thing the COVID vaccine does, that simply isolation won't do if you get it, is to deal with people that are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic.
[01:49:06.714 --> 01:49:08.757]  So you're talking about a tiny, tiny group of people.
[01:49:09.178 --> 01:49:13.264]  The risk of that group of people transmitting the virus is even more tiny.
[01:49:13.764 --> 01:49:19.206]  The risk that that group transmitted and causes severe bodily injury is even more tiny.
[01:49:19.666 --> 01:49:28.050]  And in fact, some early studies have shown, at least in the context of children, that the risk from the vaccine is greater than the risk from COVID.
[01:49:28.270 --> 01:49:31.491]  Yeah, these are the early indicators.
[01:49:31.771 --> 01:49:33.612]  Let's do one more segment with Bob Barnes here.
[01:49:34.852 --> 01:49:38.354]  And by the way, I mean, think about it.
[01:49:39.417 --> 01:49:44.882]  Well, we'll get into it on the other side with Bob Barnes, the side effects of these vaccines and what it could mean for employers that force it.
[01:49:46.143 --> 01:49:47.785]  We're back here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:49:47.805 --> 01:49:48.785]  Owen Schroer sitting in.
[01:49:48.825 --> 01:49:50.887]  We're live at FreeWorldNews.tv.
[01:49:51.368 --> 01:49:52.789]  Bob Barnes is with us.
[01:49:53.590 --> 01:49:56.632]  If your employer is trying to force you to take a vaccine,
[01:49:57.984 --> 01:50:01.447]  Bob is kind enough to have penned a letter that you can share.
[01:50:01.467 --> 01:50:02.388]  He said it's free use.
[01:50:02.428 --> 01:50:03.368]  It's not legal advice.
[01:50:04.209 --> 01:50:07.311]  It's just the law as he sees applicable to this situation.
[01:50:07.872 --> 01:50:12.395]  And you can find that letter and put your name on it and sign it.
[01:50:13.356 --> 01:50:16.499]  Maybe you are the employee of the year, like he puts at the bottom of his letter.
[01:50:16.519 --> 01:50:21.042]  I have a feeling Robert Barnes is the employee of the year at Viva Barnes Law.
[01:50:21.062 --> 01:50:24.185]  I don't know, there may be a fight happening there between the two of them.
[01:50:24.905 --> 01:50:29.509]  But you can take this, copy it, if you want to add something to it, delete something to it, but it's right there, free use.
[01:50:30.290 --> 01:50:32.532]  So, Bob Barnes has been so kind to pin that.
[01:50:33.292 --> 01:50:34.753]  A couple questions I have left for you.
[01:50:34.874 --> 01:50:44.702]  First of all, though, you know, here's something interesting that I'm thinking as you're talking in the last segment, saying it has to be proven, you know, to stop harm from being done to others.
[01:50:46.004 --> 01:50:50.788]  They've never really changed, they never really came out and said that they changed their mind on this or that there was any science.
[01:50:50.848 --> 01:50:57.232]  But remember, when the vaccine first came out, they said, you have to keep wearing the mask because you could still spread the virus.
[01:50:57.252 --> 01:50:58.593]  You could still contract it and spread it.
[01:50:58.613 --> 01:51:00.455]  Well, they never really changed their mind on that.
[01:51:00.975 --> 01:51:06.019]  It just seems like I guess they're taking the mask off and Fauci says, oh, you know, I just didn't want to confuse people.
[01:51:06.039 --> 01:51:08.540]  Well, if you're listening to Fauci, you're more confused than ever.
[01:51:09.762 --> 01:51:19.174]  So, I mean, I guess we wouldn't really know the answer of if it's going to stop a spread or not until the FDA approves of it, or when would we even know that?
[01:51:21.084 --> 01:51:23.465]  I mean, they've given different points at different times.
[01:51:24.005 --> 01:51:25.325]  I think the issue is this.
[01:51:25.565 --> 01:51:36.289]  One is whether it the first talk about this vaccine was that it only protected you, that it was a therapeutic, that it minimized the viral load, not that it reduced transmission rate.
[01:51:36.789 --> 01:51:45.452]  The problem was not that many people were that interested in having an experimental vaccine running around their body if all it did was act as a partial therapeutic.
[01:51:46.195 --> 01:51:50.917]  And so they've changed their position over time to say now they have minimal evidence.
[01:51:50.957 --> 01:51:59.440]  They have some evidence, more than they used to, but still not overwhelming evidence on whether or not this vaccine actually reduces the transmission.
[01:51:59.780 --> 01:52:00.820]  And here's the other component.
[01:52:01.500 --> 01:52:03.401]  We all know how you can avoid transmission.
[01:52:04.295 --> 01:52:06.916]  Once you have it, you just self-isolate for a couple of weeks.
[01:52:07.436 --> 01:52:12.779]  So, the vaccine is not needed to reduce transmission for people who know they have it.
[01:52:13.139 --> 01:52:18.521]  The only reason for the vaccine, legally, is to reduce transmission of those people who don't know they have it.
[01:52:18.901 --> 01:52:22.003]  These are the people that are pre-symptomatic, asymptomatic.
[01:52:22.552 --> 01:52:33.235]  Now the problem with that is, they originally tried to propose a bunch of arguments that there was high risk of transmission with that category, but as the evidence has accumulated, it's just the opposite.
[01:52:33.275 --> 01:52:40.858]  There is very little evidence that pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic people spread it, for the very simple reason that their viral load is extremely low.
[01:52:41.398 --> 01:52:52.821]  So just like the vaccine reduces the viral load, thus reduces transmission, well a person who's already pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic is not going to transmit it at a high risk at all because their viral load is so low.
[01:52:53.321 --> 01:53:01.563]  So what that means is the only people that the vaccine is really reducing transmission from are people who already don't transmit it at a high rate at all anyway.
[01:53:02.183 --> 01:53:09.305]  And that's why the vaccine cannot meet the traditional constitutional standards for coercion or compelling a vaccine.
[01:53:09.705 --> 01:53:21.628]  The only cases that have ever allowed this are where not only is there overwhelming evidence the vaccine is very safe and effective, but also that there is serious risk of the disease with a substantial risk of transmission
[01:53:22.028 --> 01:53:23.049]  Without the vaccine.
[01:53:23.349 --> 01:53:27.251]  That's simply not been proven here at all in the COVID-19 context.
[01:53:27.571 --> 01:53:34.996]  And I think that's why from a constitutional standard, if the law is applied, state governments and federal governments cannot mandate it.
[01:53:35.456 --> 01:53:38.898]  And I think it's why you're seeing them try to avoid mandating it.
[01:53:39.358 --> 01:53:42.840]  That, you know, state governments are talking about it but haven't fully done it yet.
[01:53:43.240 --> 01:53:45.822]  The federal government is backing off of doing it altogether.
[01:53:46.202 --> 01:53:55.928]  Instead, they're trying to trick employers and trick educational institutions and trick restaurants and bar owners and people that do travel with airlines.
[01:53:56.408 --> 01:54:00.630]  Trick them into requiring it so that the governments don't have to.
[01:54:01.271 --> 01:54:02.692]  And that was why we created this letter.
[01:54:02.712 --> 01:54:08.335]  That's going to be the first line of the war on vaccine passports is going to be your employer.
[01:54:09.075 --> 01:54:10.655]  And your university and your school.
[01:54:10.875 --> 01:54:12.356]  The second and maybe the airlines.
[01:54:12.456 --> 01:54:14.116]  The second will be the government.
[01:54:14.676 --> 01:54:16.216]  But we're prepared to take on both.
[01:54:16.856 --> 01:54:20.217]  But I don't think that this vaccine can meet constitutional scrutiny.
[01:54:20.597 --> 01:54:23.638]  Not only because it's nowhere near the standard for safe and effective.
[01:54:24.098 --> 01:54:26.698]  Not only that it doesn't have the standards for that as we noted.
[01:54:27.078 --> 01:54:30.439]  I mean if the other component with this is if you want to say a vaccine is safe.
[01:54:31.099 --> 01:54:33.099]  You need to be able to have robust debate.
[01:54:33.279 --> 01:54:35.020]  You need to have the procedures involved.
[01:54:35.320 --> 01:54:36.820]  Create confidence in the outcome.
[01:54:37.398 --> 01:54:38.279]  Robust debate.
[01:54:39.060 --> 01:54:39.821]  No censorship.
[01:54:39.881 --> 01:54:40.621]  No suppression.
[01:54:40.662 --> 01:54:42.624]  Encouragement of dissenting opinions.
[01:54:43.344 --> 01:54:45.226]  And second, you need to have no immunity.
[01:54:45.667 --> 01:54:47.168]  No immunity for those making it.
[01:54:47.248 --> 01:54:48.810]  No immunity for those giving it.
[01:54:48.870 --> 01:54:52.314]  No immunity for those crafting it, creating it, distributing it.
[01:54:53.374 --> 01:55:02.017]  And at a minimum, and you can't have a situation where you have any information that raises questions about it is marginalized.
[01:55:02.337 --> 01:55:07.899]  But let me just go back to your first point, because this is actually so important and I was going to bring this up next, is that
[01:55:09.912 --> 01:55:12.053]  Well, what would the standard for this be?
[01:55:12.493 --> 01:55:14.954]  You know, the standard would be science and data.
[01:55:15.134 --> 01:55:17.115]  And quite frankly, we just don't have enough.
[01:55:17.135 --> 01:55:18.376]  The FDA hasn't approved it.
[01:55:18.856 --> 01:55:19.956]  It's still in trial mode.
[01:55:20.437 --> 01:55:24.178]  I mean, which is like a whole other ballgame to begin with.
[01:55:24.638 --> 01:55:26.339]  But the problem is, it's not the science or the data.
[01:55:26.379 --> 01:55:27.720]  The media is the standard.
[01:55:28.320 --> 01:55:30.161]  The media is what they hold up as the standard.
[01:55:30.201 --> 01:55:32.683]  And oh, since the media is panicked, I have to be panicked.
[01:55:32.963 --> 01:55:35.965]  Forget whatever the data or the science is, the media is panicked.
[01:55:36.105 --> 01:55:39.587]  And if we were being honest about this, we would be, hey, you know what?
[01:55:39.607 --> 01:55:40.347]  We made a mistake.
[01:55:40.367 --> 01:55:41.668]  We shouldn't have closed everything.
[01:55:41.788 --> 01:55:43.029]  That was a huge, giant mistake.
[01:55:43.049 --> 01:55:44.630]  We didn't know enough about this virus to do it.
[01:55:45.230 --> 01:55:46.631]  But okay, we made that mistake.
[01:55:46.671 --> 01:55:46.951]  Whatever.
[01:55:46.971 --> 01:55:47.551]  We won't admit it.
[01:55:48.032 --> 01:55:49.232]  But the media is the standard.
[01:55:49.252 --> 01:55:53.735]  So if the media is panicked, then now I have to be forced vaccinated because the media is panicked.
[01:55:53.755 --> 01:55:55.056]  I mean, that's essentially what they're saying.
[01:55:56.773 --> 01:56:02.259]  It's very much, the methods that they're using are reasons to distrust the vaccine by itself.
[01:56:02.800 --> 01:56:18.557]  Even if you didn't have a problem with mRNA technology, even if you didn't have a problem with using human beings as guinea pigs, even if you didn't have a problem with the idea that coronaviruses were magically going to be cured, even though they're constant changing makes it almost impossible for even the flu shot to work consistently year in year out.
[01:56:19.017 --> 01:56:35.240]  Even if you didn't have any of those problems, the methods they've chosen to say you can't debate this, you can't disagree with this, you can't dissent on this, you can't challenge it, you can't contest it, you can't question it, and everybody involved is completely immune just in case they did something wrong.
[01:56:35.780 --> 01:56:39.542]  So, I mean, there's no, nobody has skin in the game on their side of the aisle.
[01:56:39.662 --> 01:56:41.823]  Except the person who's being forced to consume it.
[01:56:42.124 --> 01:56:43.384]  So let me ask you this, though.
[01:56:44.125 --> 01:56:46.166]  It's kind of a two-part question.
[01:56:46.306 --> 01:56:48.287]  Spend the last two minutes, however you want to answer it.
[01:56:49.988 --> 01:56:59.073]  Under the Emergency Youth Authorization, I mean, do the negative side effects from the vaccines, are they different when it's FDA approved versus when it's under the EUA?
[01:56:59.873 --> 01:57:00.614]  Authorization.
[01:57:00.714 --> 01:57:09.179]  But also, what is the difference between, say, a grocery store or a venue forcing you to take a vaccine versus an employer?
[01:57:09.199 --> 01:57:11.040]  Because you could have the argument of, well, you could quit your job.
[01:57:11.060 --> 01:57:12.661]  Just like, well, go somewhere else.
[01:57:12.981 --> 01:57:14.242]  So what is the difference there?
[01:57:15.529 --> 01:57:22.392]  Sure, almost all public accommodations for the same reason of civil rights laws are covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act.
[01:57:22.772 --> 01:57:35.558]  That's why I brought suit against hospitals, brought suits against stores, brought suits against others that simply had the mask mandate that failed to accommodate for people who cannot wear the mask or for whom it's more risk that they wear the mask.
[01:57:35.919 --> 01:57:40.821]  The same logic, the same law applies in the vaccine context.
[01:57:41.181 --> 01:57:55.718]  So if any place says we're not going to allow you to have access to us without proof of your medical status, then that's violating the ADA unless they make reasonable accommodation for you to be able to get whatever you need from that store or that location.
[01:57:56.619 --> 01:58:08.509]  And now in this context, this often is a HIPAA violation for public accommodations places to demand you disclose your private medical information as a condition of access to the place.
[01:58:08.869 --> 01:58:11.391]  The ADA prohibits it in the employment context.
[01:58:11.692 --> 01:58:14.254]  HIPAA prohibits it in the public accommodations context.
[01:58:14.754 --> 01:58:20.560]  Now, there's people like airlines and others that you can't sue under the law, so that's how they get away with it.
[01:58:20.880 --> 01:58:37.036]  But in terms of your stores, your restaurants, your bars, your any place of public accommodation, the way to think about it is, if they couldn't discriminate upon basis of race or gender, then they can't discriminate on the basis of health, and they can't discriminate on the basis of perceived health.
[01:58:37.476 --> 01:58:40.418]  Sometimes people don't think of this issue as a health issue, but it is.
[01:58:40.919 --> 01:58:42.460]  It's perceived medical status.
[01:58:42.700 --> 01:58:49.305]  You're being perceived as a medical threat if you're not vaccinated and they're discriminating against you without the evidentiary basis.
[01:58:49.345 --> 01:58:54.549]  And this is like, we need a whole other precedent here of it's not just innocent till proven guilty.
[01:58:54.769 --> 01:58:58.612]  How about not sick and contagious until proven sick and contagious?
[01:58:59.353 --> 01:59:00.974]  Bob Barnes, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:59:01.014 --> 01:59:06.158]  Looking forward to next Tuesday evening, you'll be debating very spiritedly, I'm sure, Nick Fuentes.
[01:59:06.178 --> 01:59:06.879]  Looking forward to that.
[01:59:08.109 --> 01:59:08.750]  Yeah, they'll be fun.
[01:59:08.790 --> 01:59:13.013]  I think he might have been drunk at the time he accepted the debate, but I think it'll be a lot of fun.
[01:59:14.615 --> 01:59:17.157]  All right, and we'll all be drunk while we're watching it, I'm sure.
[01:59:17.177 --> 01:59:25.504]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schroer here hosting the Alex Jones Show, broadcasting live at FreeWorldNews.tv.
[01:59:25.524 --> 01:59:29.668]  It's going to be my final segment hosting today.
[01:59:30.802 --> 01:59:34.083]  And I guess this week as well, filling in for Alex, he'll be back next week.
[01:59:34.103 --> 01:59:37.924]  Of course, he'll be back Sunday night with our Sunday Night Live streams.
[01:59:38.745 --> 01:59:40.525]  They go from 4 to 8 p.m.
[01:59:40.645 --> 01:59:42.626]  Alex with the first two hours of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:59:42.646 --> 01:59:44.046]  Then I host Sunday Night Live.
[01:59:45.747 --> 01:59:55.410]  What I'm going to do here, I am going to be able to cover pretty much all of this news that I had on my desk.
[01:59:55.590 --> 01:59:58.451]  I got to all my video clips.
[02:00:01.016 --> 02:00:08.478]  And so, when I host the War Room, my normal hosting duties, when I host the War Room from 3 to 6 p.m.
[02:00:09.679 --> 02:00:14.920]  this evening, I'm going to do phone calls for the entire three hours.
[02:00:16.320 --> 02:00:17.841]  So, we'll make up for lost time.
[02:00:17.861 --> 02:00:19.441]  We didn't take too many phone calls this week.
[02:00:19.601 --> 02:00:24.723]  I will take phone calls for the entire three hours of the War Room today.
[02:00:27.712 --> 02:00:32.995]  And so we'll just do open lines, anything you want to discuss, what we've discussed so far on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:33.795 --> 02:00:35.296]  It's all key information.
[02:00:36.036 --> 02:00:39.017]  And so we'll do that on a Friday on The War Room Today.
[02:00:39.417 --> 02:00:52.103]  And remember that everything we do here is brought to you by you shopping at InfoWarsStore.com, getting the great supplements, getting the t-shirts, the hats, the water filters, the air filters, your support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:00:53.323 --> 02:00:55.865]  Is the key to keeping us on air.
[02:00:55.885 --> 02:01:08.994]  So yeah, we've dealt with all the censorship and we've been able to come out of it and kind of in many ways be stronger than ever with all of our own video platforms like the latest freeworldnews.tv.
[02:01:09.034 --> 02:01:13.458]  It's only possible with your financial support at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:01:13.598 --> 02:01:16.139]  And so we will continue this intrepid journey.
[02:01:17.600 --> 02:01:20.723]  Ramming heads against the fake news media and the New World Order.
[02:01:21.343 --> 02:01:24.265]  As long as you continue to financially support us at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:01:24.626 --> 02:01:29.589]  But don't forget also, if you can't financially support us, support us in the Info War.

[02:01:31.651 --> 02:01:32.791]  Tell your friends and family.
[02:01:33.212 --> 02:01:34.893]  Share FreeWorldNews.tv.
[02:01:34.973 --> 02:01:36.694]  Make them ban that URL.
[02:01:37.174 --> 02:01:39.356]  Make them ban FreeWorldNews.tv.
[02:01:39.396 --> 02:01:41.658]  And people say, whoa, they banned FreeWorldNews.tv?
[02:01:41.818 --> 02:01:43.179]  Yeah, they don't want to live in a free world.
[02:01:44.540 --> 02:01:44.660]  So,
[02:01:46.021 --> 02:01:54.316]  Let me finish up on the news here today and then Stu Peters is going to take over and host the rest of the way.
[02:01:59.571 --> 02:02:27.912]  has his money where it needs to be to screw us over and rig elections and everything else Soros kicked in two million dollars to elect Maricopa County Sheriff now stonewalling election audit Sheriff Paul Penzone objects to sharing data with a private uncertified hacking company based on a hunch despite a court order so he's breaking the law and he doesn't want this audit to continue because he's Soros funded Soros rigs elections
[02:02:30.447 --> 02:02:39.334]  It's so key when you remember that it was Joe Arpaio who's so beloved and popular, there's no way he lost that election.
[02:02:40.895 --> 02:02:51.704]  But so, you fund $2 million, you get Soros Fund's own $2 million, you get his face everywhere, you rig the election, and then people don't notice how it's rigged because you saw his face everywhere.
[02:02:52.785 --> 02:02:57.348]  And then you get rid of the great American sheriff and patriot Joe Arpaio.
[02:02:58.171 --> 02:03:00.652]  That's how that works.
[02:03:02.773 --> 02:03:12.717]  You also have Apple's co-founder Steve Jobs' widow, who's a big mega-donor now too, getting a lot of that money and putting it towards leftist causes.
[02:03:12.757 --> 02:03:14.657]  She kicked in another quarter million as well.
[02:03:15.077 --> 02:03:23.341]  And now that sheriff, that crooked Soros-funded sheriff, is trying to stop the Maricopa County election audit.
[02:03:23.381 --> 02:03:23.761]  Do you see
[02:03:25.489 --> 02:03:27.411]  These people work in unison.
[02:03:27.431 --> 02:03:28.772]  They plan years ahead.
[02:03:28.832 --> 02:03:30.754]  They knew they were going to steal Maricopa County.
[02:03:31.494 --> 02:03:33.757]  They knew they had to get R. Pyle out of there to do it.
[02:03:34.517 --> 02:03:35.118]  And they did it.
[02:03:35.598 --> 02:03:36.239]  And then they did it.
[02:03:39.655 --> 02:03:40.315]  More, though.
[02:03:40.555 --> 02:03:41.256]  It's BS.
[02:03:41.416 --> 02:03:57.247]  Arizona Democrat Senator Martin Quesada loses it, tells the Gateway Pundit reporter he wants to get rid of voter ID, and then has his bigotry of low expectations and says minorities can't get a license to go vote.
[02:03:57.287 --> 02:03:58.928]  And so, of course, voter ID is racist.
[02:03:58.968 --> 02:04:00.089]  One of the biggest lies.
[02:04:00.470 --> 02:04:01.550]  One of the other lies.
[02:04:01.690 --> 02:04:03.472]  There's countless lies.
[02:04:03.532 --> 02:04:04.132]  The list of lies.
[02:04:05.529 --> 02:04:09.010]  That Democrats and Liberals spout.
[02:04:11.071 --> 02:04:11.811]  On a hunch.
[02:04:13.111 --> 02:04:13.711]  On a hunch.
[02:04:15.112 --> 02:04:19.013]  A hunch that Biden got more votes than Obama.
[02:04:19.453 --> 02:04:22.054]  Biden got more votes than Obama with half the counties.
[02:04:22.474 --> 02:04:26.155]  Biden won counties where Trump was clearly extremely popular.
[02:04:26.175 --> 02:04:28.495]  Yeah, there's the video of the Gateway Pundit reporter.
[02:04:28.775 --> 02:04:30.036]  Thank God for the Gateway Pundit.
[02:04:30.916 --> 02:04:32.857]  Man, are these Democrats crooked or what?
[02:04:33.397 --> 02:04:39.879]  And now you have the loving tolerant left sending terroristic threats to Arizona Republicans.
[02:04:40.419 --> 02:04:45.401]  Suspicious package with unidentified white powder sent to Arizona GOP Senate Leader's office.
[02:04:46.121 --> 02:04:46.942]  Karen Phan.
[02:04:47.022 --> 02:04:53.427]  So, yes, that's the liberal, loving, tolerant left threatening Republicans for doing a vote audit.
[02:04:53.728 --> 02:04:56.390]  Which, of course, they don't trust the results of the 2016 election.
[02:04:56.430 --> 02:05:01.955]  They thought it was stolen from Russia, even though they got their research into that with millions of dollars.
[02:05:01.975 --> 02:05:02.875]  That was allowed to go on.
[02:05:02.895 --> 02:05:03.576]  They found nothing.
[02:05:03.996 --> 02:05:12.584]  You're not allowed to look into how they stole the Arizona election, which we have a pretty good idea of how they did that now, don't we?
[02:05:13.885 --> 02:05:14.645]  Don't we indeed.
[02:05:15.786 --> 02:05:25.428]  So, Mollie Tibbetts, I believe I'm saying that right, Mollie Tibbetts was murdered by an illegal immigrant from Mexico.
[02:05:26.189 --> 02:05:34.591]  And this story was on the news this morning, and so I was kind of following it, and I'm stunned at what is happening here.
[02:05:35.872 --> 02:05:40.573]  The media is now trying to make, and I'm not kidding you,
[02:05:41.684 --> 02:05:50.501]  They are now trying to make the murderer, who's admitted to the murder, Rivera, an illegal immigrant from Mexico, they're now trying to make him the victim!
[02:05:52.028 --> 02:06:04.232]  And so I saw this, and I saw that the agents that were questioning him said, oh, he was remorseful, oh, he regrets it, oh, he was under attack, and then the media saying he was under attack, and saying how he's the victim.
[02:06:04.652 --> 02:06:06.953]  And so I'm like, I can't even believe this.
[02:06:07.193 --> 02:06:11.074]  Is this how much the media hates white people, and how much they love illegal immigrants?
[02:06:11.514 --> 02:06:17.836]  Or do they just know that this is such a bad look, an illegal immigrant murdering a woman, that they just want this story to go away?
[02:06:17.936 --> 02:06:19.416]  And so I was like, but you know what, it can't be that bad.
[02:06:19.436 --> 02:06:21.457]  Let me go look into this, and let me just find out.
[02:06:22.745 --> 02:06:35.081]  So apparently, and this is all in the testimony, Rivera is stalking this woman who goes jogging in his car, then gets out of the car and stalks her on foot.
[02:06:36.403 --> 02:06:49.667]  She then defends herself, because she's like, get away from me, you creep, you stalker, and slaps him, to which he then loses his mind, and as his testimony says, he blacks out!
[02:06:50.067 --> 02:07:04.552]  So he gets so angry, he blacks out, and he claims he has no recollection from when after she slapped him, after he stalked her, he claims he has no recollection, he blacked out from anger, and his attorneys are arguing this, and the media's saying, yep, okay,
[02:07:06.414 --> 02:07:13.140]  He's saying he blacked out from anger and he doesn't know what happened from the minute after she struck him trying to get away from him.
[02:07:13.660 --> 02:07:15.562]  Obviously, he was a predator.
[02:07:16.402 --> 02:07:19.525]  To the moment where he's in his car and she's dead in the vehicle with him.
[02:07:20.045 --> 02:07:21.026]  And he has no idea!
[02:07:21.086 --> 02:07:21.727]  He blacked out!
[02:07:21.787 --> 02:07:22.667]  Oh, I have no idea!
[02:07:22.908 --> 02:07:23.888]  And I'm so sorry!
[02:07:24.109 --> 02:07:25.650]  And the media's saying he's the victim!
[02:07:25.890 --> 02:07:26.511]  He didn't know!
[02:07:26.731 --> 02:07:28.052]  He got attacked by this woman!
[02:07:28.232 --> 02:07:29.193]  And he's remorseful!
[02:07:29.853 --> 02:07:30.974]  Unbelievable!
[02:07:31.074 --> 02:07:31.655]  I couldn't believe it.
[02:07:31.675 --> 02:07:33.276]  I was like, oh, maybe there's something to this.
[02:07:33.296 --> 02:07:33.897]  And I looked into it.
[02:07:33.937 --> 02:07:34.457]  No, folks.
[02:07:35.118 --> 02:07:35.238]  No.
[02:07:36.616 --> 02:07:38.857]  That's the story they're trying to tell us.
[02:07:39.477 --> 02:07:39.977]  Moving on.
[02:07:41.758 --> 02:07:47.200]  How many of these Zoom school meetings, courtroom meeting blunders are we going to see?
[02:07:47.620 --> 02:07:49.101]  At this point, I'm almost for it.
[02:07:50.041 --> 02:07:58.064]  Virtual school, New York City teacher suspended after sucking man's nipple on Zoom while students watched.
[02:07:59.105 --> 02:08:01.026]  How in the hell are... What?
[02:08:03.168 --> 02:08:13.292]  You've got liberal journalists walking around naked, masturbating on film, people showing up for their court dates with a name that says, uh, Butt Muncher.
[02:08:13.432 --> 02:08:15.172]  I'm putting it G-rated, folks.
[02:08:15.212 --> 02:08:17.513]  It's, you know, it's not Butt Muncher, but you can imagine.
[02:08:18.813 --> 02:08:25.396]  And now you've got New York City teachers engaging in nipple play with their, with their, I guess, a gay lover?
[02:08:25.496 --> 02:08:27.477]  I mean, my goodness gracious.
[02:08:30.298 --> 02:08:31.418]  Control yourselves.
[02:08:34.327 --> 02:08:35.467]  Unidentified man.
[02:08:35.768 --> 02:08:36.048]  Uh-huh.
[02:08:36.788 --> 02:08:38.128]  Control yourselves.
[02:08:38.689 --> 02:08:39.849]  Control yourselves.
[02:08:41.229 --> 02:08:42.030]  Oh my gosh.
[02:08:43.470 --> 02:08:44.150]  What to get to?
[02:08:44.230 --> 02:08:44.931]  Alex covered this.
[02:08:44.971 --> 02:08:45.831]  Fertility crisis.
[02:08:45.891 --> 02:08:47.772]  Men will no longer produce sperm by 2045, says top
[02:08:50.868 --> 02:09:13.878]  Epidemiologists, you've got Black Lives Matter silent on an 80-year-old black man shot and killed by stray bullet in the Bronx, and you've got the liberal media quiet on the racist Lori Lightfoot, who says she will not take questions or have any reporters that are white in her presence, which is odd because she's married to a white woman.
[02:09:14.758 --> 02:09:18.840]  Now, you may see this and say, that looks like Big Bird Rachel Maddow, but no, that is a woman.
[02:09:20.520 --> 02:09:27.525]  So, Lori Lightfoot married to a white woman, but bans white reporters from her presence.
[02:09:28.225 --> 02:09:29.046]  Unbelievable.
[02:09:29.826 --> 02:09:30.987]  Or maybe not so much.
[02:09:31.047 --> 02:09:32.348]  That is the Democrats.
[02:09:32.468 --> 02:09:37.971]  Racist, hate-filled, bigots, morons, mental disorders, mental patients.
[02:09:38.091 --> 02:09:38.832]  You know who they are.
[02:09:39.292 --> 02:09:40.693]  That does it for me on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:09:40.713 --> 02:09:42.454]  I'll be hosting the War Room, taking your phone calls.
[02:09:42.474 --> 02:09:43.415]  Stu Peters takes over.
[02:09:44.400 --> 02:09:45.423]  Hey, my name is Stu Peters.
[02:09:45.463 --> 02:09:46.867]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:09:46.887 --> 02:09:47.910]  Bandness.tv.
[02:09:47.930 --> 02:09:49.514]  You can find me at StuPeters.tv.
[02:09:51.321 --> 02:09:52.141]  So much to cover.
[02:09:52.161 --> 02:09:56.722]  An hour is just not enough time, but that's all that I am blessed with to be here with you today.
[02:09:56.742 --> 02:09:58.122]  We're going to have Dr. Jane Ruby.
[02:09:58.202 --> 02:10:01.483]  Everybody's been talking about this shedding thing that has been going on.
[02:10:02.023 --> 02:10:08.104]  She has been researching this thing to the hilt, and the question is, you know, who can shed?
[02:10:08.184 --> 02:10:09.064]  How does it shed?
[02:10:09.444 --> 02:10:10.404]  How does it affect you?
[02:10:10.464 --> 02:10:13.625]  Is there a reversal for the injected, the inoculated?
[02:10:13.685 --> 02:10:15.725]  All these different questions.
[02:10:15.845 --> 02:10:16.785]  She's making news today.
[02:10:17.005 --> 02:10:20.086]  She's going to break news here on InfoWars.
[02:10:21.106 --> 02:10:26.171]  She's going to break news on the Alex Jones Show and she is going to bless us with her presence.
[02:10:26.211 --> 02:10:27.592]  That's going to be a lot to get to.
[02:10:27.652 --> 02:10:30.214]  She's not available here for about another few minutes.
[02:10:30.395 --> 02:10:45.508]  But before that, I want to talk to you also about rehashing some of the things that I'm wondering why this wasn't brought up during the world's most prolific trial of Derek Chauvin in the so-called murder of George Floyd.
[02:10:47.381 --> 02:10:50.765]  There were some things that were never discussed and I want to know why.
[02:10:50.785 --> 02:11:01.779]  I briefly talked about this at StuPeters.tv during a show the other day, but I really want to get into it and so today we're going to be joined by a former prosecutor.
[02:11:03.140 --> 02:11:06.925]  Wayne Ferguson will be here, but whether or not you agree with
[02:11:07.634 --> 02:11:21.620]  You know, the way that the officers handled the situation, whether or not you agree with the department approved tactics of Officer Derek Chauvin, former Minneapolis Police Officer Chauvin, that's not what I want to discuss here.
[02:11:22.300 --> 02:11:25.461]  I don't, I'm not here to debate the police tactics with you.
[02:11:26.042 --> 02:11:29.483]  And I don't care if you're a cop that agrees with him or disagrees with him.
[02:11:29.523 --> 02:11:32.064]  That's not, we're all people who want justice.
[02:11:32.104 --> 02:11:34.265]  And I know that due process is such a racist term.
[02:11:35.015 --> 02:11:52.026]  It's expecting for that to happen in a world of instant gratification, in a world where we are surrounded by people who are running toward a jab, tripping over each other, signing up for this thing that, by the way, it took a billion dollars in, quote, vaccine confidence to get people to go take.
[02:11:52.506 --> 02:11:53.286]  It's beyond me.
[02:11:53.326 --> 02:12:00.489]  People are walking around with ineffective, dirty, contaminated diapers on their face, voluntarily, vowing never to take them off again.
[02:12:00.529 --> 02:12:01.929]  That is the world that we live in.
[02:12:02.410 --> 02:12:06.511]  So to try to make sense of some of this to certain people is not going to happen.
[02:12:06.551 --> 02:12:10.433]  But we all, I think, want the same thing, which is justice and a clear picture of truth.
[02:12:12.384 --> 02:12:19.809]  My question is about a person who was directly responsible for the outcome, a person who had the opportunity to change it.
[02:12:20.209 --> 02:12:31.116]  That nine-minute video that we're all well too familiar with, those nine minutes on the streets at 38th and Chicago on the south side of Minneapolis never had to happen.
[02:12:32.537 --> 02:12:34.578]  And I want to know why we're not talking about it.
[02:12:35.433 --> 02:12:42.940]  I'd like to pose the question why Derek Chauvin's criminal defense team didn't really raise this as a major issue.
[02:12:42.960 --> 02:12:48.265]  Now, if you watched the trial in its entirety, you might remember the testimony of Jenna Scurry.
[02:12:50.027 --> 02:12:51.208]  She's the dispatcher.
[02:12:51.528 --> 02:12:55.112]  She's employed by the Minneapolis Emergency Communications Center, MECC.
[02:12:56.451 --> 02:13:04.417]  She was responsible for the response of police, fire, and medics to that scene in front of Cup Foods at 38th and Chicago.
[02:13:04.457 --> 02:13:07.379]  She was the principal dispatcher for the call.
[02:13:07.880 --> 02:13:17.227]  She had certain responsibilities that were extremely important for many reasons, but she violated policy and nobody is talking about it.
[02:13:18.328 --> 02:13:18.568]  Why?
[02:13:20.137 --> 02:13:25.401]  We're going to go over this and I'm going to have Wayne Ferguson in here to talk about whether or not this would have made a difference.
[02:13:25.441 --> 02:13:41.232]  But the Minneapolis dispatcher, primary policy, who's responsible for tracking the MPD officers, updating their CAD, their computer screens, and then making sure that the public is afforded the proper resources that they are needed.
[02:13:41.252 --> 02:13:46.696]  The dispatcher's role in the delivery of those public safety services and the protection of her police
[02:13:47.296 --> 02:13:56.165]  She has certain guidelines, certain policies that she's trained on in order to provide those services to the public and to the cops and she didn't.
[02:13:56.225 --> 02:14:01.009]  She violated policy and on May 25th, those nine minutes would have never happened.
[02:14:01.049 --> 02:14:09.197]  That video would have never existed because Chauvin and Floyd would have not spent those nine minutes together had she not violated policy.
[02:14:11.215 --> 02:14:14.478]  The police dispatcher responsibility policy is clearly outlined.
[02:14:14.898 --> 02:14:23.206]  She's been trained that each decision made by personnel working these positions is based on policy and procedure and she violated that.
[02:14:24.767 --> 02:14:30.652]  I'm going to expose that and we're going to talk about it with Wayne Ferguson coming up on the Alex Jones Show as we continue.
[02:14:30.672 --> 02:14:32.734]  My name is Stu Peters from StuPeters.TV.
[02:14:33.075 --> 02:14:34.376]  We'll be back in just a couple of minutes.
[02:14:35.632 --> 02:14:39.376]  The police dispatcher's responsibility policy is clearly outlined.
[02:14:39.436 --> 02:14:46.444]  She was trained on it, but Jenna Scurry violated that policy, which resulted in that nine-minute video, the world's most prolific trial.
[02:14:46.944 --> 02:14:57.376]  The death of George Floyd, although I believe was imminent because of ingesting three times the lethal amount of fentanyl, could have been prevented if he was provided the attention
[02:14:57.896 --> 02:15:09.479]  That was necessary and those life-saving efforts could have started many many many minutes earlier because Jenna Scurry's policy says that she should have started fire rescue but never did.
[02:15:10.279 --> 02:15:16.521]  Now let me just let me just break this down for you when about a minute 32 into their contact
[02:15:17.512 --> 02:15:20.213]  Officers there requested Medics Code 2.
[02:15:20.253 --> 02:15:22.414]  That means kind of a routine response.
[02:15:22.474 --> 02:15:23.494]  No lights and sirens.
[02:15:23.794 --> 02:15:29.596]  But just seconds later, they asked for Jenna Scurry to step up the medic response to Code 3.
[02:15:30.116 --> 02:15:33.897]  Well, they originally told her that Floyd was bleeding from the mouth.
[02:15:33.917 --> 02:15:34.797]  He had a head injury.
[02:15:35.918 --> 02:15:42.900]  Her policy at the MECC clearly states that a head injury automatically adds fire rescue.
[02:15:43.709 --> 02:15:51.173]  Now, Station 17, for the Minneapolis Fire Department, is six blocks away from 38th and Chicago, out in front of Cup Foods there.
[02:15:52.193 --> 02:15:57.056]  That full body camera footage, by the way, is displayed on YouTube and every- I mean, there's no place that you can go.
[02:15:57.976 --> 02:16:00.477]  There's no excuse for not seeing that body cam footage.
[02:16:01.658 --> 02:16:07.201]  But she had all kinds of different things at her disposal, including something that she normally doesn't have, which is video.
[02:16:07.221 --> 02:16:09.862]  She was actually watching this thing occur.
[02:16:11.869 --> 02:16:19.473]  So when she requested, when they requested officer, excuse me, medical for a head injury, she's automatically supposed to add fire rescue.
[02:16:19.513 --> 02:16:21.754]  These firefighters were sitting on their hands.
[02:16:21.774 --> 02:16:23.776]  Rescue was six blocks away.
[02:16:24.356 --> 02:16:28.698]  That route, that response time for six blocks, how long does it take you to drive six blocks?
[02:16:29.619 --> 02:16:34.902]  I mean, less than a minute, but instead they waited for nine minutes.
[02:16:36.963 --> 02:16:37.063]  Now,
[02:16:38.180 --> 02:16:44.723]  When Floyd was pulled out of the vehicle and given over to medics and then they went to a secondary location, they are the ones that had to call fire rescue.
[02:16:44.743 --> 02:16:48.505]  But those life-saving efforts would have started a long time prior to that.
[02:16:50.386 --> 02:16:54.088]  Now, the primary policy, it's right here laid out for you.
[02:16:54.728 --> 02:17:00.891]  Dispatching calls for service, tracking of the MPD officers, we went over all of that, but radio
[02:17:02.430 --> 02:17:09.272]  And CAD, in that order, are the primary responsibilities of the dispatcher when assigned to the dispatcher position.
[02:17:09.312 --> 02:17:11.933]  It says it in bold right there, the primary responsibility.
[02:17:12.313 --> 02:17:18.714]  So why did Jenna Scurry not talk to her cops for more than five minutes?
[02:17:19.194 --> 02:17:24.476]  Didn't ask for a status update, didn't ask if they were good to go, didn't ask if they needed any additional resources.
[02:17:24.516 --> 02:17:25.136]  It's her job!
[02:17:26.883 --> 02:17:28.304]  She didn't add fire rescue.
[02:17:28.664 --> 02:17:39.270]  Then when they asked her just seconds later to step up that emergency response to Code 3, lights and sirens, that is the cops telling Jenna Scurry, we need medical here.
[02:17:39.690 --> 02:17:41.131]  We want them here now.
[02:17:41.531 --> 02:17:44.453]  Whoever can get to the scene first, we want them here.
[02:17:44.493 --> 02:17:47.935]  She still did not add fire to the call.
[02:17:49.056 --> 02:17:49.336]  Why?
[02:17:51.644 --> 02:18:00.971]  Now, I have personal knowledge of police procedure because of my 18-year career working as a bail enforcement agent, as a fugitive investigator.
[02:18:01.011 --> 02:18:05.195]  I worked alongside cops for 18 years, specifically in the city of Minneapolis.
[02:18:05.635 --> 02:18:11.840]  A head injury, I'm going to quickly tell you, right now, automatic fire rescue is added to a call.
[02:18:11.860 --> 02:18:13.621]  She didn't add it for the head injury.
[02:18:14.022 --> 02:18:16.323]  Code 3 response, we want him here right now.
[02:18:16.724 --> 02:18:18.085]  She didn't add it then either.
[02:18:20.330 --> 02:18:33.278]  So since making the policy violation discovery, I contacted six senior Minneapolis police officers, three of which are sergeants and have many years of experience dealing with uncooperative suspects and situations requiring medical response.
[02:18:33.458 --> 02:18:33.878]  All of them.
[02:18:34.358 --> 02:18:41.503]  A hundred percent of them said that it's standard procedure for Code 3 medical requests to dispatch fire to the call.
[02:18:41.763 --> 02:18:46.606]  Ninety percent of the time, or eight times out of ten, maybe eighty percent of the time, the cops cancelled fire.
[02:18:49.397 --> 02:18:50.278]  But they're still sent.
[02:18:50.398 --> 02:18:51.198]  They're still added.
[02:18:51.919 --> 02:19:05.367]  Now, I reached out to a senior dispatcher from MECC who works there, where Jenna Scurry works, and she said, quote, in the case of Floyd, both would be started, meaning EMS and fire, and it would be up to the cops to cancel fire.
[02:19:05.387 --> 02:19:07.769]  So she concurs with what all six cops said.
[02:19:07.789 --> 02:19:13.793]  So then I asked another veteran officer about this who responded to me, of course, both should have been added.
[02:19:14.253 --> 02:19:18.876]  From the cops perspective and from what they were dealing with, it's easy to focus on all the a-holes yelling.
[02:19:19.317 --> 02:19:27.022]  By then the cops assumed that they had asked for medical code 3 response and had asked for medics for a head injury which should automatically include fire rescue.
[02:19:27.042 --> 02:19:28.183]  So she violated policy.
[02:19:28.523 --> 02:19:29.604]  Well why is this important?
[02:19:29.664 --> 02:19:36.249]  Because station 17 again is just six blocks away and those nine minutes would have never happened.
[02:19:36.909 --> 02:19:39.191]  As an additional frustration,
[02:19:40.217 --> 02:19:44.781]  She testified that she was watching the milestone cameras and that she felt something was wrong.
[02:19:44.821 --> 02:19:45.702]  She testified to that.
[02:19:46.223 --> 02:19:50.046]  But yet she didn't communicate with her officers for another five minutes.
[02:19:50.647 --> 02:19:57.794]  And finally did so only to update them, to advise them of EMS location, which was at the wrong place.
[02:19:58.034 --> 02:19:58.835]  Five minutes.
[02:19:58.915 --> 02:20:00.116]  If something wasn't right,
[02:20:00.797 --> 02:20:05.843]  Wouldn't the first step to take to be to communicate with her cops to find out what was going on?
[02:20:06.303 --> 02:20:07.084]  What was needed?
[02:20:07.444 --> 02:20:08.666]  What she could provide them with?
[02:20:08.706 --> 02:20:11.929]  I mean, these are just common sense questions, but what about actual policy?
[02:20:11.949 --> 02:20:16.574]  Well, when they were first requested for a head injury, they should have been added.
[02:20:16.914 --> 02:20:18.156]  That's in her policy.
[02:20:19.560 --> 02:20:31.566]  When the response was requested to be emergent, stepped up to Code 3, meaning the first available medical resources to this scene right now, they still weren't added and she still didn't communicate with her cops for five minutes.
[02:20:31.626 --> 02:20:40.351]  It couldn't be more clear that she was in violation of the clearly written directives pertaining to the criteria for adding rescue when they're not automatically part of the response.
[02:20:40.871 --> 02:20:47.435]  The very first bulleted point in that policy says that rescue should be added for spinal neck or head injuries and she didn't do it.
[02:20:47.475 --> 02:20:48.316]  He had a head injury.
[02:20:48.656 --> 02:20:50.577]  The cop said he was bleeding from his mouth.
[02:20:52.218 --> 02:20:53.198]  That's not a leg injury.
[02:20:53.218 --> 02:20:55.240]  That's not an arm injury.
[02:20:56.220 --> 02:20:57.441]  He's bleeding from his mouth.
[02:20:57.481 --> 02:20:58.602]  That's a head injury.
[02:21:00.062 --> 02:21:03.324]  During her testimony, Scurry explained what Code 3 means.
[02:21:03.364 --> 02:21:05.005]  She's very familiar with the term.
[02:21:05.466 --> 02:21:06.766]  She said, quote, emergent.
[02:21:07.427 --> 02:21:09.188]  They want them here as soon as possible.
[02:21:12.540 --> 02:21:17.944]  From a common sense, from a policy, and from a procedural standpoint, she was in complete violation.
[02:21:17.985 --> 02:21:20.406]  This is the policy that she has been trained on.
[02:21:21.227 --> 02:21:24.550]  Why didn't Chauvin's defense team make a really big deal out of this?
[02:21:27.172 --> 02:21:40.283]  She made comments about how her attention was distracted away from the cameras because she was going back and forth between her screen, adding remarks, dispatching other calls, yet she only dispatched two other incidents during that entire time.
[02:21:41.710 --> 02:21:44.533]  And still didn't talk to her cops for five minutes.
[02:21:44.573 --> 02:21:46.335]  Now remember, we just displayed it on the screen here.
[02:21:46.716 --> 02:21:49.919]  According to the police dispatcher, responsibility is clearly outlined.
[02:21:51.281 --> 02:21:56.006]  Radio and CAD, in that order, are the primary responsibility of the dispatcher.
[02:21:57.034 --> 02:21:58.835]  So why the radio silence for five minutes?
[02:21:59.155 --> 02:22:00.015]  Why no rescue?
[02:22:00.355 --> 02:22:01.756]  Why the policy violation?
[02:22:02.056 --> 02:22:09.858]  And more importantly, why is it being shoved under the rug when Scurry's violation of that policy contributed directly to the death of George Floyd?
[02:22:09.878 --> 02:22:20.522]  And had she acted in accordance with policy and added rescue, who were only six blocks away, George Floyd would have been rendered the emergency medical attention that her cops were screaming for on the radio.
[02:22:22.706 --> 02:22:25.088]  Joining us right now is attorney Wayne Ferguson.
[02:22:25.148 --> 02:22:26.450]  He was a prosecutor.
[02:22:26.470 --> 02:22:32.575]  He is now the founder and the big boss over at Ferguson Law PA.
[02:22:32.956 --> 02:22:34.577]  Would this have made a difference, Wayne?
[02:22:35.978 --> 02:22:43.946]  If these people, if his defense team would have brought this up, these clear policy violations, could this have made a difference in the criminal outcome or conviction in this case?
[02:22:45.240 --> 02:22:51.003]  Absolutely could have made a difference and I don't think it can be overstated how big of a deal that this is that you're bringing up.
[02:22:52.004 --> 02:22:57.627]  I'm looking at the, granted I'm a Florida attorney, but I am looking at the Minnesota jury instructions.
[02:22:58.187 --> 02:22:59.848]  Right here in the jury instructions it says,
[02:23:00.789 --> 02:23:03.570]  Um, for him to be found guilty to cause death.
[02:23:03.650 --> 02:23:08.712]  This is the definitions, the legal definitions that were given to the, uh, the jury.
[02:23:09.012 --> 02:23:16.194]  And it says the cause of death means that the defendant's actual actions were the substantial factor in the causing of George Floyd's death.
[02:23:16.734 --> 02:23:20.796]  The defendant is criminally liable for all the consequences of his actions that occur.
[02:23:21.596 --> 02:23:25.737]  This is the important part in the ordinary, natural and course of events.
[02:23:26.078 --> 02:23:29.979]  And Stu, I think one of the big things that you're bringing up is there's nothing ordinary about the situation, right?
[02:23:30.586 --> 02:23:36.451]  I mean, if I'm the defense attorney, I'd be screaming that.
[02:23:37.132 --> 02:23:41.876]  Because what you say is, this is nothing ordinary and natural about this.
[02:23:42.256 --> 02:23:51.925]  You're saying that ordinary policy says that you're supposed to dispatch a medic when you're supposed to do all these things, and it never happened.
[02:23:52.498 --> 02:23:55.440]  I mean, this is a dereliction of duty.
[02:23:55.980 --> 02:23:58.602]  And frankly, I mean, you're talking about a head injury.
[02:23:58.642 --> 02:24:03.005]  I mean, is that the ordinary natural course of events for them not to call?
[02:24:03.105 --> 02:24:04.646]  No, it's absolutely not.
[02:24:23.171 --> 02:24:24.492]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:24.532 --> 02:24:25.732]  My name is StuPete.
[02:24:25.872 --> 02:24:28.053]  StuPete.tv is where you can find me.
[02:24:28.073 --> 02:24:42.778]  We're talking about these blatant and clear policy violations by the emergency dispatcher for the city of Minneapolis during the George Floyd incident that led to the conviction of officer, former officer Derek Chauvin, who was convicted of murder.
[02:24:43.218 --> 02:24:51.221]  And we've talked about how the cops were there screaming for medical help on the air, originally for a head injury, asking for a routine response.
[02:24:51.261 --> 02:24:52.442]  Floyd was bleeding from the mouth.
[02:24:53.456 --> 02:24:57.740]  Jenna Scurry automatically, by her policy, should have added fire to that call.
[02:24:58.320 --> 02:25:01.403]  Firefighters, rescue rigs, six blocks away.
[02:25:02.504 --> 02:25:04.045]  How long does it take you to drive six blocks?
[02:25:04.085 --> 02:25:04.866]  We talked about that.
[02:25:06.039 --> 02:25:07.761]  Nine minutes is what it took.
[02:25:07.781 --> 02:25:17.950]  There is fire station number 17, just six blocks away from 38th and Chicago, where officers were asking for medical response.
[02:25:18.010 --> 02:25:24.636]  Just seconds later, they upgraded that response level, begging for Jenna Scurry to send them emergent.
[02:25:24.716 --> 02:25:26.138]  Code three, lights and sirens.
[02:25:26.158 --> 02:25:26.958]  We want them here now.
[02:25:27.018 --> 02:25:28.600]  She still did not add fire.
[02:25:29.258 --> 02:25:39.144]  She said she was watching all of this unfold on cameras right in front of her and testified that normally dispatchers don't have access to that kind of a visual of the scene.
[02:25:39.544 --> 02:25:51.091]  So even being provided with additional information of what was going on there, she still did not upgrade, she still did not add fire in complete violation and blatant disregard for policy and common sense.
[02:25:52.944 --> 02:25:57.668]  And didn't talk to her cops on the radio, which is her primary function.
[02:25:57.708 --> 02:26:06.736]  According to the description, according to her policy, and according to her procedure, her primary function when dealing with this stuff is the radio and the CAD.
[02:26:07.716 --> 02:26:08.557]  What was she doing?
[02:26:08.617 --> 02:26:10.279]  She only dispatched two other calls.
[02:26:10.319 --> 02:26:15.203]  Now, if it can get more disturbing, even more disturbing than all of this,
[02:26:16.096 --> 02:26:18.877]  Is that call to her sergeant that she testified she made.
[02:26:18.917 --> 02:26:21.898]  Now this didn't happen until, what was it?
[02:26:22.278 --> 02:26:22.698]  20, 30 hours.
[02:26:22.758 --> 02:26:24.059]  That's 8.30 p.m.
[02:26:24.079 --> 02:26:29.981]  12 minutes after they took George Floyd out of that squad car.
[02:26:31.481 --> 02:26:35.823]  2 minutes after EMS requested rescue to start to the scene.
[02:26:36.263 --> 02:26:38.483]  Which they should have never had to request.
[02:26:39.304 --> 02:26:42.945]  Because rescue should have arrived on the scene long before them.
[02:26:44.289 --> 02:26:48.931]  Had Jenna Scurry followed her policy, the policy that she's trained on?
[02:26:49.351 --> 02:26:53.893]  Now, it's... It's believed that she still has a job.
[02:26:55.634 --> 02:26:58.875]  She also has not been criminally tried, or prosecuted, or charged.
[02:27:00.276 --> 02:27:12.061]  But if all of these other officers that were there, that were begging her for this medical response, if they were there and they're all being charged, because they're supposedly
[02:27:12.890 --> 02:27:16.231]  Complicit or aided or added to the death of George Floyd?
[02:27:16.251 --> 02:27:18.592]  Well, so did she.
[02:27:18.612 --> 02:27:21.752]  And why is nobody asking this question?
[02:27:21.812 --> 02:27:27.614]  If she was so concerned like she testified, why did she wait so long to call her sergeant?
[02:27:27.634 --> 02:27:30.275]  Now, as I said, I reached out before we went to the break to John Elder.
[02:27:30.675 --> 02:27:33.476]  He's the public information officer for the Minneapolis Police Department.
[02:27:33.536 --> 02:27:34.476]  I called him for comment.
[02:27:35.561 --> 02:27:36.382]  I text him rather.
[02:27:54.898 --> 02:28:05.265]  The only response that they have given me is that we're not going to comment because there's an ongoing criminal probe and other officers and there's still an investigation going on and a trial that will occur or multiple trials that will occur.
[02:28:05.305 --> 02:28:10.689]  There's also the federal DOJ civil rights trials and violations that Biden's going to come after them for.
[02:28:10.789 --> 02:28:13.150]  And I have also an inside source.
[02:28:13.190 --> 02:28:14.411]  I've never revealed this before.
[02:28:14.451 --> 02:28:17.053]  I'll do it right now here on InfoWars on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:28:17.553 --> 02:28:21.796]  I have an inside person that works in the Minnesota Department of Corrections.
[02:28:22.927 --> 02:28:26.810]  Now, this person has been with the Department of Corrections for over two decades.
[02:28:27.630 --> 02:28:42.680]  They have been responsible for supervising the custody status of baby rapers, killers, cop killers, murderers, serial killers, all of these people, not once, ever, has any elected representative ever requested information about an inmate.
[02:28:44.201 --> 02:28:52.186]  And now I'm getting information from this source, which can't obviously be in writing, because of the sensitivity of this information,
[02:28:52.921 --> 02:29:09.869]  But that the governor of Minnesota, Tim Walz, has contacted the Commissioner of Corrections, the supervisor that oversees all of the Minnesota prison system, and requested all of Derek Chauvin's communications while he has been in custody.
[02:29:11.221 --> 02:29:16.103]  Why would the governor, who's a non-law enforcement official, be requesting that information?
[02:29:16.143 --> 02:29:31.407]  Now again, I cannot confirm that, because I don't have, you know, the physical evidence in my hand that this has been done, but I have no reason to discredit or otherwise not believe my source, who's worked there for over two decades.
[02:29:31.647 --> 02:29:39.350]  This person is very concerned about that happening, and it's very clear that this political prisoner is trying to be- is- they're attempting to bury him
[02:29:42.080 --> 02:29:42.820]  Beyond belief.
[02:29:44.361 --> 02:29:49.123]  Now, 911 dispatchers are often taught that seconds save lives.
[02:29:50.704 --> 02:29:54.425]  In this case, rescue would have made that difference.
[02:29:56.026 --> 02:30:10.772]  That nine-minute video would have never existed because those nine minutes would have never occurred if that dispatcher, Jenna Scurry, had taken her job seriously
[02:30:11.562 --> 02:30:17.744]  And followed policy, those nine minutes would have never occurred, and George Floyd may still be alive.
[02:30:19.704 --> 02:30:25.365]  Joining us here for the last couple of minutes of this segment is attorney Wayne Ferguson, Ferguson Law PA.
[02:30:25.405 --> 02:30:31.287]  He's in Florida, but he's very familiar with these Minnesota statutes and this direction to the jury.
[02:30:32.975 --> 02:30:37.341]  Wayne, before we went, you said that this positively could have made a difference in the trial.
[02:30:37.962 --> 02:30:48.537]  Why, could you speculate, and I know that you're not here and I know that you weren't involved, but can you speculate as to what possible reasons Derek Chauvin's defense team
[02:30:49.477 --> 02:31:09.352]  Might have had for not really making a serious issue out of this blatant, clear violation of policy that can be easily substantiated through radio traffic, body cam footage, all of the audio, the 911 recordings, the bystander video, the policy that we've laid out here.
[02:31:09.752 --> 02:31:16.817]  It clearly shows that Jenna Scurry did not act inside of that policy with medics and proper medical care sitting just six blocks away.
[02:31:16.918 --> 02:31:18.559]  Why would a defense team
[02:31:19.119 --> 02:31:23.761]  Just let that breeze by without creating a hellstorm?
[02:31:23.781 --> 02:31:26.962]  Stu, I have no idea.
[02:31:27.002 --> 02:31:28.263]  That's a great question.
[02:31:28.983 --> 02:31:32.805]  I would be screaming this at the jury, like I said before, because here's the thing.
[02:31:32.865 --> 02:31:40.248]  The jury instructions say the defendant is not criminally liable if a superseding cause caused the death.
[02:31:40.548 --> 02:31:47.571]  A superseding cause is one that intervenes or one that changes or alters the natural sequence of events.
[02:31:48.348 --> 02:31:53.549]  So to your point, if this never would have happened, would that have altered the natural course of events?
[02:31:53.729 --> 02:31:54.370]  Absolutely.
[02:31:54.490 --> 02:31:55.250]  It wouldn't have happened.
[02:31:55.930 --> 02:32:03.632]  So the jury was told in the jury instructions that if there was a superseding cause, Mr. Chauvin is not guilty.
[02:32:04.832 --> 02:32:11.094]  But yet this wasn't raised and it's very strange at best why they didn't do that.
[02:32:13.297 --> 02:32:16.498]  Well, we really appreciate you being here and we appreciate your insight on that.
[02:32:17.478 --> 02:32:20.819]  Wayne Ferguson, Ferguson Law PA out of Florida.
[02:32:21.540 --> 02:32:22.880]  We appreciate your expertise.
[02:32:22.960 --> 02:32:39.305]  You know, and you got to try to start thinking about all of the reasons why, and in a world full of misinformation and all these conspiracy theories, I interviewed George Papadopoulos yesterday talking about John Durham.
[02:32:40.066 --> 02:32:42.649]  And why it's taking so long on the Durham deal?
[02:32:43.169 --> 02:32:57.243]  You start thinking about everything involved with a global effort to like unseat a president, you know, to hijack an election, to topple an entire political system and Black Lives Matter being the fastest growing political party in the world?
[02:32:59.153 --> 02:33:01.154]  You gotta consider everything to be a possibility.
[02:33:01.634 --> 02:33:03.015]  More of the Alex Jones Show coming up next.
[02:33:15.821 --> 02:33:16.421]  You got to get over there.
[02:33:16.441 --> 02:33:21.823]  It's also at Infowars website, and you can check it out there as well.
[02:33:22.083 --> 02:33:23.023]  We got to get right into this.
[02:33:23.043 --> 02:33:27.464]  There's a lot of very important information to get to on these companies that are pushing these evil injections.
[02:33:28.364 --> 02:33:35.166]  They skipped over all the animal studies, all these preclinical trials, all this work prior to jabbing humans.
[02:33:36.466 --> 02:33:39.488]  Dr. Jane Ruby has, she brought us the shedding thing.
[02:33:39.528 --> 02:33:40.949]  We've been talking about the shedding.
[02:33:41.789 --> 02:33:49.733]  We now have revealed that inside of these injections is a substance that's not approved for humans or even veterinary use.
[02:33:50.873 --> 02:33:57.637]  You know, we've studied the SARS-CoV-2 and spike proteins, but Dr. Ruby is here now because she is a bombshell.
[02:33:58.017 --> 02:34:02.579]  She's making news today on a report about where these spike particles were showing up.
[02:34:03.306 --> 02:34:05.187]  And that is the source of the shedding.
[02:34:05.227 --> 02:34:06.648]  Dr. Ruby, thanks a lot for being here.
[02:34:08.449 --> 02:34:09.229]  My pleasure, Stu.
[02:34:09.449 --> 02:34:12.050]  I've got this incredible report.
[02:34:12.110 --> 02:34:23.896]  It's actually buttressed by a number of preclinical researchers with regard to the potential mechanism or vehicle, if you will, for this shedding phenomenon.
[02:34:24.352 --> 02:34:38.602]  Which Pfizer itself in its own documentation warned about with regard to men who have gotten the jab and then are intimately involved or even with close proximity to their wives in terms of a fear of miscarriage.
[02:34:39.102 --> 02:34:50.030]  The vehicle that this shedding seems to be happening through, and I've never said that science was going to be pretty, but it's fecal, it could be fecal transmission.
[02:34:50.550 --> 02:34:55.351]  It looks like it is a fecal-oral or a fecal-hand-to-oral.
[02:34:55.671 --> 02:34:56.612]  Why do I say this?
[02:34:56.972 --> 02:35:12.136]  What they have found is that when this jab and the material in it forces your body to make the spike proteins, and everybody should be very familiar with what these things are now, what it does is it's called, the process is called a proteolytic process.
[02:35:12.216 --> 02:35:16.997]  Big fancy name for when the process of forcing you to make the spikes occurs.
[02:35:17.437 --> 02:35:19.618]  These things don't happen in a vacuum, Stu.
[02:35:20.083 --> 02:35:23.525]  The cells send out what's called exosomes.
[02:35:23.965 --> 02:35:31.448]  These exosomes can take the spike proteins and we know that the spike proteins are going to end up in every cell in your body very quickly.
[02:35:31.828 --> 02:35:40.292]  But these exosomes are the transport mechanism to get the spike protein into every cell in your body, including a concentration, if you will,
[02:35:40.760 --> 02:35:51.846]  In the feces, one researcher found that fecal RNA from these spike proteins is detected in over 70% of patients with viral shedding through their GI tract.
[02:35:52.266 --> 02:35:53.647]  And as I said, it's not pretty.
[02:35:53.967 --> 02:35:58.070]  We've heard about other diseases that are transmitted through the fecal-oral route.
[02:35:59.130 --> 02:36:01.932]  It comes from not washing your hands properly after
[02:36:02.793 --> 02:36:15.872]  Passing feces and I have said to people before breaking this just get different bathrooms or use different bathrooms because it looks like there is a transmission mechanically and possibly through the hands.
[02:36:16.400 --> 02:36:27.109]  But remember, there have been studies for years now talking about how if you flush the toilet after passing feces, that fecal material does get on your countertops, your toothbrushes.
[02:36:27.449 --> 02:36:28.450]  Those are not myths.
[02:36:28.550 --> 02:36:30.431]  And so we think that we're putting this together.
[02:36:30.451 --> 02:36:35.555]  And if we are, we can at least offer some hope and let people protect themselves.
[02:36:36.016 --> 02:36:40.960]  I wanted to share from a couple of researchers out in Portland, Oregon, if you can imagine this.
[02:36:41.820 --> 02:36:49.228]  In a virus vaccine journal, they actually directly addressed the vaccine shedding.
[02:36:49.728 --> 02:36:57.536]  And what they basically said is that through the exosomes, it is very possible and very likely that these spike proteins are being transmitted.
[02:36:58.457 --> 02:37:00.659]  Now, remember what I've said from the beginning.
[02:37:01.081 --> 02:37:05.026]  We know that the spike protein is the pathogen.
[02:37:05.106 --> 02:37:07.869]  What that means is that's what's causing the illness.
[02:37:08.250 --> 02:37:11.874]  The spike protein is what makes you sick, makes you come down with the flu-like symptoms.
[02:37:12.235 --> 02:37:18.963]  And they are highly contagious because remember their function, as they stick out from the viral cellular capsule,
[02:37:21.125 --> 02:37:23.707]  So you're saying, basically, that if an injected person
[02:37:47.552 --> 02:38:13.456]  If you're living with an injected person, maybe your spouse got injected prior to this information being at their disposal, maybe they work for Delta Airlines where it's being required that you're vaccinated before you're allowed to work, or one of these other, you know, globalist manipulated companies that is unconstitutionally forcing people to become inoculated with an experimental injection that we have proven to be damaging, VAERS numbers are being deleted.
[02:38:14.416 --> 02:38:14.677]  I think?
[02:38:34.571 --> 02:38:47.056]  Was who received the vaccine and then through breastfeeding apparently is how this person, this baby experienced, you know, catastrophic organ failure and then ultimately death.
[02:38:47.096 --> 02:38:50.938]  We have 15, 16, 17 year olds that were being reported to VAERS.
[02:38:51.278 --> 02:38:55.580]  Since we brought attention to that, the corruption has gotten into VAERS.
[02:38:56.760 --> 02:39:02.743]  Those particular numbers, VAERS ID numbers that I shared on the national platform have been removed.
[02:39:02.763 --> 02:39:03.523]  They've been deleted.
[02:39:04.818 --> 02:39:11.924]  The VAERS search function altogether, Dr. Ruby, was disabled for 48 hours after that broadcast.
[02:39:13.045 --> 02:39:25.875]  And then Tucker Carlson brought attention to that, that the VAERS functionality was being hindered or disabled in some way, shape, or form, alluding to a possible collusion or conspiracy to prevent the information from becoming public.
[02:39:25.915 --> 02:39:27.677]  But despite all of the corruption,
[02:39:28.397 --> 02:39:49.194]  And despite all of the variants and the factors and the numbers and the reporting, it's really all we have to go on, and that is still suggesting that there are now over 73,000 vaccine-related injuries or deaths resulting from these injections that we used to refer to as experimental, but I don't think it's an experiment.
[02:39:49.594 --> 02:39:54.678]  I think they know exactly what they were doing, and there's evidence to suggest, Dr. Ruby, that they knew about this stuff.
[02:39:55.717 --> 02:39:57.457]  Yes, they definitely knew about it, Stu.
[02:39:58.158 --> 02:40:05.880]  As I said, and we posted it on the show before, Pfizer put out a warning in their protocol documents about the transmission.
[02:40:05.940 --> 02:40:13.722]  And remember, we've been talking about transmission for a long time, but we haven't really had a handle, or much of a handle, on the mode of transmission.
[02:40:14.082 --> 02:40:19.083]  These folks also, these researchers also said that there were high concentrations in sputum,
[02:40:19.543 --> 02:40:21.284]  Mucous epithelial lining.
[02:40:21.684 --> 02:40:23.805]  Epithelial lining lines your organs.
[02:40:25.266 --> 02:40:26.786]  And bronchial lavage.
[02:40:26.827 --> 02:40:28.027]  That's a different story.
[02:40:28.567 --> 02:40:35.330]  But the point of this is that over 70% of these spike proteins are found in fecal material.
[02:40:35.751 --> 02:40:41.353]  There is a definite mechanical, what I mean by that is it's not biochemical, it's physical.
[02:40:41.473 --> 02:40:45.135]  From inside the body to outside the body of transmission.
[02:40:45.555 --> 02:40:46.856]  And this is incredibly
[02:40:47.389 --> 02:40:53.977]  Dangerous, but I also think it suggests that there is a way to protect ourselves from the unvaccinated.
[02:40:54.037 --> 02:41:06.333]  I'm getting a ton of mail since being on your show and Alex's show from people saying, look, I've got a relative, a family member, a parent, a significant other who's vaccinated or as I like to say, you know, experimentally injected.
[02:41:06.733 --> 02:41:08.114]  And how much risk am I at?
[02:41:08.154 --> 02:41:12.756]  And I think you're at somewhat a high risk, but now we know where it might be coming from.
[02:41:12.776 --> 02:41:18.719]  So we could do some practical things like a little more hand washing and using different bathrooms.
[02:41:18.859 --> 02:41:20.820]  We don't know how long this effect lasts.
[02:41:21.220 --> 02:41:26.623]  And the part that makes me really angry and concerned, Stu, is that they've known about it all along.
[02:41:27.383 --> 02:41:34.888]  And the mechanism for these jabs is to force your body, I want to keep emphasizing this, to force your body to do what?
[02:41:35.348 --> 02:41:42.692]  To replicate in the billions these spike proteins that we now know are the pathogens.
[02:41:42.752 --> 02:41:47.815]  They're the disease causers of COVID-19 and they're causing much more than that.
[02:41:48.195 --> 02:41:54.597]  They're really competing with the ACE2 receptor, which is the ACE2 is protective in your body.
[02:41:54.957 --> 02:42:10.443]  And what's happening is by these spike proteins kind of nudging out the ACE2 enzyme and jumping on that receptor, the spikes are causing all kinds of physical damage, like the bleeding, the blood clots, the miscarriages, the damage to placenta.
[02:42:11.448 --> 02:42:12.388]  Very scary stuff.
[02:42:12.888 --> 02:42:18.509]  Glad that there is some positive takeaway that there's a way to try to cut down on some of this spread.
[02:42:18.929 --> 02:42:24.470]  Maybe not engage in gay sex would be number one of them, anal sex, obviously.
[02:42:24.550 --> 02:42:27.731]  And then also to maybe use a different bathroom.
[02:42:28.171 --> 02:42:33.952]  There's also a meeting that nobody's talking about that the CDC had way back in December of 2020.
[02:42:34.552 --> 02:42:37.773]  And we're going to talk about that after the break.
[02:42:38.013 --> 02:42:39.013]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:42:39.033 --> 02:42:39.793]  My name is Stu Peter.
[02:42:39.813 --> 02:42:40.193]  Stick around.
[02:42:40.874 --> 02:42:48.166]  Freeworldnews.tv, that is of course the new site, the banning just continues, the globalists in there.
[02:42:49.544 --> 02:43:00.386]  Panic, in all of the panic, to try to keep the people from exposing the truth about everything that's going on as these globalists continue to tighten the news, controlling world economies, changing health care.
[02:43:00.926 --> 02:43:03.827]  Now the buzzwords are social security and cryptocurrency.
[02:43:03.967 --> 02:43:04.367]  Why?
[02:43:04.387 --> 02:43:07.508]  I've got something on that over at StuPeters.TV.
[02:43:07.588 --> 02:43:08.588]  I hope you'll join us there.
[02:43:08.908 --> 02:43:10.248]  We have Dr. Jane Ruby here.
[02:43:10.288 --> 02:43:11.128]  Very important stuff.
[02:43:11.148 --> 02:43:18.170]  She's making news today, folks, breaking information on how this shedding occurs, which is really bad news for
[02:43:19.610 --> 02:43:21.271]  Homosexuals, specifically.
[02:43:21.291 --> 02:43:27.434]  But also, if you share a bathroom with somebody who's been injected or inoculated, try to avoid doing that, if you can.
[02:43:27.494 --> 02:43:40.401]  Because right now, Dr. Ruby is suggesting that feces or fecal matter is the primary way that this shedding is occurring, which could make you very sick, ultimately even lead to your death, bleeding from your eyes and ears.
[02:43:40.441 --> 02:43:42.022]  I mean, this stuff is actually occurring, folks.
[02:43:42.042 --> 02:43:44.503]  This isn't hyperbole for shock value programming here.
[02:43:45.243 --> 02:43:45.884]  I'm on Infowars.
[02:43:45.904 --> 02:43:49.245]  But the second issue that I want to address with Dr. Ruby is this.
[02:43:50.006 --> 02:43:59.711]  Nobody's talking about the CDC's big meeting called the update on December 20th before this whole jab program ramped up.
[02:43:59.751 --> 02:44:08.676]  And it seems that the committee had a whole lot of recommendations, Dr. Ruby, to protect people that everyone is ignoring in this big jab push.
[02:44:09.736 --> 02:44:11.197]  What did you discover about this meeting?
[02:44:12.853 --> 02:44:31.677]  Well, you know, Stu, all we've heard from the beginning from experts, the CDC, Fauci, all these people, is that the vaccines are safe, the injections are safe, babies, unborn babies, pregnant women, all of a sudden now we have this report coming out from a December 2020 meeting.
[02:44:32.197 --> 02:44:36.999]  And what I've learned is that that committee had a whole lot of recommendations to their audience.
[02:44:37.399 --> 02:44:38.819]  And let me share something with you.
[02:44:39.386 --> 02:44:46.752]  They talked about the fact that the vaccine should be deferred for anyone with an allergic reaction.
[02:44:47.112 --> 02:44:49.934]  And let me say, they defined allergic reaction.
[02:44:49.974 --> 02:44:58.381]  First of all, the most severe form of an allergic reaction is an anaphylactic reaction, which is a full body, you know, can't breathe, swelling.
[02:44:59.309 --> 02:45:00.270]  Airway shuts down.
[02:45:00.790 --> 02:45:05.112]  It's a momentary crisis and you need immediate emergency medical help.
[02:45:05.532 --> 02:45:27.724]  But beyond that, and there have been a lot of those, but beyond that, they define, and appropriately so, I might add, that the definition of an immediate allergic reaction also includes signs or symptoms such as urticaria, which is itching, angioedema, which is any swelling anywhere in your ears, your nose, your throat, respiratory distress.
[02:45:28.208 --> 02:45:40.314]  How many times have we seen in the VAERS database, wheezing, stridor, which is sort of an audible attempt to breathe, like a wheezing type thing that occurs within four hours of administration.
[02:45:40.875 --> 02:45:47.398]  So they're talking about, first of all, defining that and giving the audience of doctors guidance.
[02:45:47.538 --> 02:45:49.419]  And guess what the guidance was, Stu?
[02:45:50.100 --> 02:45:52.160]  And I'll read it directly from their report.
[02:45:52.300 --> 02:45:54.121]  And this is in the public domain as well.
[02:45:54.661 --> 02:45:56.221]  Here's my favorite bullet point.
[02:45:56.641 --> 02:46:08.464]  Persons with an immediate allergic reaction to the first dose of mRNA vaccine should not receive additional doses of either of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.
[02:46:08.864 --> 02:46:10.844]  Let me repeat a part of that sentence.
[02:46:11.365 --> 02:46:13.065]  Anyone who gets a reaction
[02:46:13.686 --> 02:46:18.049]  Two, the injection should not get an additional dose.
[02:46:18.569 --> 02:46:22.591]  In other words, both of those companies with mRNA require a second dose.
[02:46:22.971 --> 02:46:24.292]  Stu, this is outrageous.
[02:46:24.732 --> 02:46:29.535]  And this is not even touching on the other issue that we're now looking at excipients.
[02:46:29.995 --> 02:46:36.319]  You're showing now, you know, actually the breakdown of symptoms and really in the first column.
[02:46:36.704 --> 02:46:44.330]  They're telling doctors to either defer the first shot and or don't give them the second shot.
[02:46:44.650 --> 02:46:45.871]  We don't hear that right now.
[02:46:45.911 --> 02:46:59.562]  We're hearing that they're setting up clinics in schools and they're enlisting the help of pediatricians, I'm sure financially, by incentivizing them to jab now babies, you know, months old, as well as small children.
[02:46:59.922 --> 02:47:01.083]  This has got to stop.
[02:47:01.324 --> 02:47:04.066]  They're not even following their own guidelines to doctors.
[02:47:05.134 --> 02:47:06.434]  Well, that's not surprising.
[02:47:07.275 --> 02:47:20.840]  You know, yesterday it broke that this SM-102, it's been kind of talked about, but this is that lipid nanoparticle that is not even approved for human or veterinary use.
[02:47:21.700 --> 02:47:27.744]  It's got this Lucifer race name, which may be actually a religious exemption for people.
[02:47:27.764 --> 02:47:30.426]  You're not going to put anything in your body with the name Lucifer in it.
[02:47:31.227 --> 02:47:33.548]  So maybe you want to take note of that.
[02:47:34.389 --> 02:47:38.031]  And then also now you were talking about this eight month old that was jabbed.
[02:47:38.051 --> 02:47:39.732]  You broke that the other day.
[02:47:40.413 --> 02:47:45.917]  There was a big story on the youngest person to be quote unquote vaccinated or jabbed with this.
[02:47:45.957 --> 02:47:47.658]  That little poor baby has no idea.
[02:47:48.318 --> 02:47:53.923]  The rest of his life, you know, why he's gonna have all these side effects and weird things happening to him.
[02:47:54.403 --> 02:48:12.558]  The positive takeaway is that the daily count of people receiving dose one reported to the CDC by the date administered here in the United States has gone down significantly since Alex Jones and myself have begun really talking about this specifically to the thanks of people like you and other brave doctors.
[02:48:13.258 --> 02:48:17.380]  Uh, like Carrie Madej and, you know, Simone Gold and some of these other people that have been coming forward.
[02:48:17.420 --> 02:48:21.042]  McCullough, there's some other really good doctors that are being brave out here coming forward.
[02:48:21.222 --> 02:48:31.087]  I talked to a person in the UK who says that a coroner during an inquest is actually going to confirm that it was the injection that killed his wife, Kim.
[02:48:31.467 --> 02:48:32.388]  We talked about that.
[02:48:33.583 --> 02:48:35.344]  But now, let's talk about this.
[02:48:35.805 --> 02:48:38.046]  What about the question that hasn't been asked?
[02:48:38.446 --> 02:48:50.014]  The billion dollars that was spent of taxpayer money, a billion, that's a billion with a B, of your money and of my money that was allocated towards what they're calling vaccine confidence.
[02:48:50.074 --> 02:48:52.115]  Now, Dr. Ruby, you just said
[02:48:52.595 --> 02:48:55.496]  That these people are ignoring the guidance, right?
[02:48:55.536 --> 02:48:56.937]  They're ignoring the warnings.
[02:48:57.217 --> 02:48:58.038]  They've been warned.
[02:48:58.078 --> 02:48:58.718]  They had this.
[02:48:58.758 --> 02:48:59.758]  There was a conference.
[02:48:59.798 --> 02:49:02.760]  You know, the CDC, way back in December, they knew about all this.
[02:49:02.780 --> 02:49:03.860]  They're still pushing for this.
[02:49:03.940 --> 02:49:06.902]  And now a billion dollars spent in vaccine confidence.
[02:49:07.242 --> 02:49:07.942]  What does that mean?
[02:49:08.022 --> 02:49:12.944]  Well, what that means is that they're using social media like Facebook and Twitter.
[02:49:13.625 --> 02:49:16.166]  They're paying these these oligos
[02:49:16.226 --> 02:49:21.869]  It's more than likely with this lipid nanoparticle, this ingredient that's not even approved for humans or let alone veterinary use.
[02:49:44.502 --> 02:49:49.105]  It's going to come out that we're seeing a decrease in people that are signing up to get this unknown jab.
[02:49:49.125 --> 02:49:55.290]  And I believe that the FDA is going to not have an easy time approving this thing.
[02:49:55.750 --> 02:50:03.175]  So the push to get everybody inoculated before the FDA says, we can't approve this thing.
[02:50:03.195 --> 02:50:12.181]  Do you agree that that might be an over-the-target analysis of why this money is being spent on convincing everybody to sales pitch to go get inoculated?
[02:50:13.723 --> 02:50:14.144]  Of course.
[02:50:14.284 --> 02:50:25.916]  In fact, I think they want to push this thing so far to get as many people injected as possible before people really find out what this is really about, what's going on, and what's inside of these things.
[02:50:26.356 --> 02:50:30.861]  And by the way, if you didn't get the Moderna, but you got the Pfizer or any of the others,
[02:50:31.277 --> 02:50:35.418]  Don't feel like you've escaped this SM-102 and the dangers of it.
[02:50:35.698 --> 02:50:41.460]  There are other excipients that are used for the nanolipid particle, like polyethylene glycol.
[02:50:41.780 --> 02:50:49.362]  You might say, well, they use it in small amounts, you know, and it's in the human body and, you know, face injections by cosmetologists and things like that.
[02:50:49.822 --> 02:50:52.463]  No, this is a very dangerous material.
[02:50:52.543 --> 02:50:53.424]  We have no idea.
[02:50:53.444 --> 02:50:57.706]  They won't disclose how much of it, what the concentration is in that injection.
[02:50:58.106 --> 02:51:02.508]  It could be very, very different from just the whatever the normal amounts are.
[02:51:02.908 --> 02:51:04.329]  And so I think there's a rush.
[02:51:04.729 --> 02:51:06.910]  I think everyone should be super suspicious.
[02:51:07.426 --> 02:51:13.411]  Why would they rush to vaccinate and inject people with something that is now over?
[02:51:14.411 --> 02:51:19.955]  There are virtually zero cases of death cases.
[02:51:20.096 --> 02:51:26.280]  And now we're pushing it on our small children and babies to kind of finish this whole process up.
[02:51:27.001 --> 02:51:29.863]  I keep telling people, Stu, they've got to wait.
[02:51:30.203 --> 02:51:32.505]  You don't lose anything right now by holding off.
[02:51:33.260 --> 02:51:53.525]  This thing and the reason why there aren't any new cases and we're coming to find out right now that it's not really the virus that's making you sick but rather that it's the spike proteins and the spike proteins are found in and created by whatever is inside of these injections which now we're slowly starting to realize are things that are not even approved for animals.
[02:51:54.477 --> 02:52:04.059]  Dr. Jean Ruby, thank you so much, and breaking news here on the Alex Jones Show at FreeWorldNews.tv about this shedding and what is causing it.
[02:52:04.099 --> 02:52:14.741]  We certainly appreciate your expertise and your responsibility in not coming out here causing a panic, because you told me yesterday that you were looking into something that could help identify this shedding stuff.
[02:52:14.781 --> 02:52:18.102]  If you have information, tips, or a story that you want to get to Dr. Ruby,
[02:52:18.582 --> 02:52:25.385]  She wants to make her personal Proton email available to you, by the way, at drjaneruby at protonmail.com.
[02:52:25.565 --> 02:52:27.405]  And we appreciate her being here.
[02:52:27.806 --> 02:52:29.966]  Owen is coming up next.
[02:52:30.006 --> 02:52:31.007]  He's got the war room.
[02:52:31.407 --> 02:52:32.888]  And my name is Stu Peters.
[02:52:33.288 --> 02:52:40.250]  By the way, I want to remind you to get over to stupeters.tv after you leave freeworldnews.tv to check out that George Papadopoulos interview.
[02:52:40.270 --> 02:52:43.912]  If you want to know what's taking so long with the Durham report, well,
[02:52:44.614 --> 02:52:45.555]  He names names.
[02:52:45.795 --> 02:52:48.276]  He goes right into all of the reasons.
[02:52:48.316 --> 02:52:50.117]  He, all of the players that are involved.
[02:52:50.137 --> 02:52:56.321]  This is a global concerted effort to topple the entire political system of our republic.
[02:52:56.841 --> 02:52:57.522]  And it's shocking.
[02:52:58.022 --> 02:52:58.743]  My name is Stu Peters.
[02:52:58.763 --> 02:53:00.063]  Thanks for having me on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:53:00.083 --> 02:53:00.724]  We'll see you next week.
[02:53:05.014 --> 02:53:11.959]  One of the best selling supplements in the United States and across the world in the last decade is magnesium powders.
[02:53:12.599 --> 02:53:13.880]  Because they work so good.
[02:53:14.321 --> 02:53:21.966]  Because they're critical to all your cells, to operating smoothly to your heart, to your brain, to your liver, to everything.
[02:53:22.006 --> 02:53:27.009]  It's something you can take in the morning and it doesn't make you tired, it makes you have smooth, clean energy.
[02:53:27.990 --> 02:53:31.272]  Every other nutrient you get is basically boosted by it.
[02:53:31.292 --> 02:53:36.415]  I'm going to go over some of the facts from the fact sheet that scientists have put together here in a moment.
[02:53:36.475 --> 02:53:38.076]  But first I want to just explain something.
[02:53:38.996 --> 02:53:40.937]  It took us several years to get this developed.
[02:53:41.698 --> 02:53:44.680]  Because I fund my operations selling products that work and that people want.
[02:53:45.540 --> 02:53:52.944]  And clearly you go to the grocery store, you go anywhere, you see them selling different brands and different forms of magnesium fizzy drinks.
[02:53:53.745 --> 02:53:55.466]  And it's something that when I forget to do it,
[02:53:56.465 --> 02:53:57.526]  My day isn't as good.
[02:53:58.046 --> 02:54:06.113]  I've been religiously, since this came in a few weeks ago, and now we've got the full shipment as we can sell it, taking it, and it's just made my life so much better.
[02:54:06.393 --> 02:54:09.856]  And it goes great with the X2, it goes great with the BrainForce Plus.
[02:54:10.256 --> 02:54:11.177]  It really is amazing.
[02:54:11.357 --> 02:54:17.402]  It's our new Ionic Fizzy Magnesium Orange Flavored Drink Mix from m4slife.com.
[02:54:18.402 --> 02:54:19.924]  Here's the scientific fact sheet.
[02:54:20.464 --> 02:54:24.065]  True Ionic Magnesium for Optimal Absorption.
[02:54:24.485 --> 02:54:25.425]  That is so important.
[02:54:25.745 --> 02:54:27.226]  The other brands work great.
[02:54:27.626 --> 02:54:31.627]  Magnesium is amazing, but they have one type of magnesium.
[02:54:31.927 --> 02:54:43.370]  This has two types of magnesium, and then when you add the other things that are in the formula, the scientists explained to us that it creates the very best form of ionized magnesium.
[02:54:43.690 --> 02:54:46.091]  That is absorbed directly into your individual cells.
[02:54:46.431 --> 02:54:47.451]  Here's another important fact.
[02:54:47.792 --> 02:54:53.914]  An estimated 75% of Americans do not meet the recommended amount of magnesium intake every single day.
[02:54:54.194 --> 02:55:00.076]  Magnesium helps regulate the sodium-potassium pumps that create the signals in the nerve cells.
[02:55:00.436 --> 02:55:08.639]  Scientists agree magnesium is the most important cofactor in the body, regulating and controlling hundreds of pathways.
[02:55:08.959 --> 02:55:09.539]  Thank you.
[02:55:30.925 --> 02:55:31.746]  I take it in the morning.
[02:55:32.087 --> 02:55:33.008]  I take it in the evening.
[02:55:33.529 --> 02:55:38.336]  It is so essential in my life, and I hope all of you will check it out and try it.

[02:56:03.660 --> 02:56:08.464]  I'm about to cut a very important ad for X2.
[02:56:09.204 --> 02:56:11.586]  Impromptu, no teleprompter, no notes, no script.
[02:56:12.107 --> 02:56:13.408]  And you know what I'm thinking about right now?
[02:56:14.520 --> 02:56:27.364]  I'm thinking about what an idiot I am because I started taking X2 seven years ago and I lost about 30 pounds in four months and my skin got healthier, my hair got healthier, my libido went off the chart.
[02:56:27.824 --> 02:56:35.106]  Everything that Dr. Group told me would happen back then when I took real atomic iodine that nobody else had on the market came true.
[02:56:35.726 --> 02:56:50.079]  And now I'm sitting here in the year 2021 realizing that on a routine basis I forget to take my X2 and I have a Lazy Susan that I put on the dining room table that my wife continues to move off of it.
[02:56:50.459 --> 02:56:52.180]  She remembers to take her supplements, I don't.
[02:56:52.521 --> 02:56:54.462]  So when I get home tonight I'm going to put the Lazy Susan
[02:56:55.103 --> 02:57:00.787]  Back out there on the table, it's actually the breakfast table, and I'm going to make sure that I religiously take it every morning.
[02:57:01.168 --> 02:57:02.228]  It's so incredible.
[02:57:02.569 --> 02:57:03.910]  And by the way, it's been sold out for a while.
[02:57:04.330 --> 02:57:05.331]  It's now back in stock.
[02:57:05.351 --> 02:57:08.233]  We have the spray bottle of it, so it aerosolizes into your throat.
[02:57:08.633 --> 02:57:10.855]  And we also have the system where it's a dropper.
[02:57:11.375 --> 02:57:14.998]  Take it under the tongue for more absorption, but it really is amazing.
[02:57:15.018 --> 02:57:18.981]  And consult your physician beforehand because it's the good halogen, the opposite of fluoride.
[02:57:19.481 --> 02:57:21.182]  X2 is back in stock.
[02:57:21.523 --> 02:57:23.064]  People ask me, well, why do you have X3 then?
[02:57:23.504 --> 02:57:27.167]  A very small percentage of people cannot absorb pure iodine.
[02:57:27.187 --> 02:57:29.168]  This is true atomic pure iodine.
[02:57:29.188 --> 02:57:32.110]  We have to have like a DEA license to get it and manufacture it.
[02:57:32.891 --> 02:57:36.434]  The other iodine is a triiodine, all three types of iodine.
[02:57:36.474 --> 02:57:39.015]  And it's better for some folks, not as good for others.
[02:57:39.336 --> 02:57:40.196]  It's apples and oranges.
[02:57:40.216 --> 02:57:40.897]  You decide.
[02:57:41.137 --> 02:57:43.819]  But X3 is also available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:57:44.159 --> 02:57:46.461]  X2 and X3 available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:57:46.821 --> 02:57:53.109]  And X2 at 50% off right now, and it funds the Infowar, a true 360 win.
[02:57:53.149 --> 02:57:54.871]  If you haven't tried X2, now's the time.
