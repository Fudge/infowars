[00:00:00.802 --> 00:00:13.206]  Bill and Melinda Gates, with just a little money to spend, but a lot of skepticism about the academic approach, agreed to meet with Lori Zabin and her colleagues at Johns Hopkins, and they came away impressed.
[00:00:14.026 --> 00:00:20.628]  In 1998, Dr. Zabin became the founding director of the Bill and Melinda Gates Institute for Population Control.
[00:00:29.872 --> 00:00:32.814]  Well, the world's doctors have split up.
[00:00:33.655 --> 00:00:40.419]  Bill and Melinda Gates are splitting up after 27 years and they ask for privacy for everyone.
[00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:50.626]  Well, you see, you don't get that privacy when you take your hundreds of billions and make it tax-exempt and then invest it back in companies you own through your non-profit.
[00:00:51.107 --> 00:00:58.072]  Bill took Microsoft's stock and he gave it to the Bill and Melinda Gates Family Foundation.
[00:00:58.936 --> 00:01:03.527]  So what do you think Bill got on his tax return for giving away a billion dollars worth of stock?
[00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:18.260]  So Bill Gates is way richer than Jeff Bezos, way, way richer than Elon Musk, because his money is laundered into these tax-free foundations.
[00:01:18.941 --> 00:01:29.531]  It's just in the last 20 years that he and Warren Buffett and a few others were allowed to put their money in this trust for the United Nations, for world population control.
[00:01:30.111 --> 00:01:31.832]  And that's what's really important here.
[00:01:32.452 --> 00:01:34.413]  Bill Gates has bought off the U.S.
[00:01:34.553 --> 00:01:36.374]  and European media almost entirely.
[00:01:36.754 --> 00:01:43.458]  Remember back in the 1990s he was busted up, Microsoft, for antitrust practices and stealing other companies' software?
[00:01:43.838 --> 00:01:45.319]  He was a known villain.
[00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:49.984]  But then he rebranded himself as the world's doctor.
[00:01:50.724 --> 00:01:57.212]  And then he went around the world and bought off over a hundred of the major regulatory agencies.
[00:01:57.732 --> 00:02:02.898]  From Communist China, to what we've seen here in the United States, to India, to South Africa.
[00:02:03.098 --> 00:02:03.859]  Over a hundred countries.
[00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.421]  But now, in just the last five years, he's been kicked out of over 30 countries, like India.
[00:02:10.021 --> 00:02:18.544]  And recently, India found out he was covertly behind the Pfizer mRNA frankenshot, and they kicked that vaccine out of India as well.
[00:02:19.064 --> 00:02:23.205]  AstraZeneca has been banned in 21 European countries, and dozens of others around the world.
[00:02:23.485 --> 00:02:27.766]  The reason that's important is, Bill Gates tells you they're all safe and effective, and you should take them.
[00:02:28.246 --> 00:02:32.953]  And he's heavily invested in five of the seven major vaccines.
[00:02:33.033 --> 00:02:39.522]  Not just the mRNA vaccines, but also he's invested through his tax-free foundation in the virus vector vaccines.
[00:02:40.592 --> 00:02:41.472]  So this is a big deal.
[00:02:42.272 --> 00:02:43.753]  Now, why did he break up with his wife?
[00:02:43.773 --> 00:02:44.673]  Why did she break up with him?
[00:02:44.713 --> 00:02:45.433]  Well, I know this.
[00:02:45.553 --> 00:02:48.674]  Bill Gates is now the most hated man in the world.
[00:02:49.254 --> 00:02:53.575]  People have got his statements about wanting to depopulate the planet, about wanting to get rid of old people.
[00:02:53.975 --> 00:02:55.895]  People have seen his statements about Planned Parenthood.
[00:02:55.915 --> 00:02:56.836]  They know about his father.
[00:02:57.036 --> 00:02:58.556]  They know about his mother at IBM.
[00:02:58.796 --> 00:03:02.697]  They know about the founder of IBM transferring his money to her and into his foundation.
[00:03:03.057 --> 00:03:06.138]  When I was growing up, my parents were always involved in various
[00:03:08.143 --> 00:03:09.003]  Volunteer things.
[00:03:09.063 --> 00:03:17.688]  My dad was head of Planned Parenthood and it was very controversial to be involved with that.
[00:03:17.868 --> 00:03:28.433]  The problem is that the population is growing the fastest where people are less able to deal with it so it's in the very poorest places.
[00:03:28.793 --> 00:03:31.554]  And what the developing world does not need is more children.
[00:03:32.955 --> 00:03:34.456]  And I think that was the biggest
[00:03:35.703 --> 00:03:47.399]  Aha to Bill and me when we got into this work, as we asked ourselves, of course, the same hard-nosed question you'd ask, which is, if you get into this work and you start to save these children, will women just keep overpopulating the world?
[00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:50.203]  And thank goodness the converse is absolutely true!
[00:03:50.643 --> 00:03:52.284]  It's known that his father helped run Cold Springs Harbor.
[00:03:52.344 --> 00:03:53.585]  That's the eugenics base in New York.
[00:03:53.605 --> 00:03:56.547]  It's known that Cold Springs Harbor funded Hitler.
[00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.931]  It's known that Bill Gates is a eugenicist depopulationist.
[00:04:19.391 --> 00:04:30.395]  It came out over a decade ago that billionaires meet in secret to discuss overpopulation and said we're trying to aid the world government in setting up a corporate system to help implement this.
[00:04:30.715 --> 00:04:37.318]  And you see Bill Gates with Klaus Schwab and other world leaders wearing that little rainbow circle system that
[00:04:38.178 --> 00:04:45.680]  Symbolizes the Great Reset, which means a post-industrial world taking carbon emissions to net zero.
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.300]  Meaning no human-generated carbon.
[00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.280]  No fireplaces, no gas heaters.
[00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.261]  Cows are bad, they fart methane.
[00:04:52.841 --> 00:04:55.281]  Humans are bad, we exhale carbon dioxide.
[00:04:55.781 --> 00:04:57.042]  Have you thought about this yet?
[00:04:57.602 --> 00:04:59.582]  That's why I made the famous joke that Ted talked about.
[00:04:59.602 --> 00:05:03.383]  We've got to lower one of these to zero and he points at humans and everybody laughs.
[00:05:03.752 --> 00:05:05.213]  First we've got population.
[00:05:05.994 --> 00:05:08.236]  The world today has 6.8 billion people.
[00:05:08.716 --> 00:05:10.318]  That's headed up to about 9 billion.
[00:05:10.938 --> 00:05:20.046]  Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.
[00:05:20.326 --> 00:05:25.030]  So let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero.
[00:05:25.831 --> 00:05:28.793]  Probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero.
[00:05:29.781 --> 00:05:32.384]  Now that's back from high school algebra.
[00:05:32.404 --> 00:05:33.546]  But let's take a look.
[00:05:33.866 --> 00:05:37.170]  This is the post-human world that the Wall Street Journal talks about.
[00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:38.371]  We're a parasite.
[00:05:38.592 --> 00:05:39.112]  We're bad.
[00:05:39.132 --> 00:05:40.093]  We need to go away.
[00:05:40.774 --> 00:05:42.756]  So a statement's up on Infowars.com.
[00:05:43.157 --> 00:05:43.798]  It's on his Twitter.
[00:05:44.198 --> 00:05:46.100]  He's used his wife as a beard.
[00:05:46.641 --> 00:05:59.092]  Not for homosexuality, no, for his corrupt so-called philanthropy that is really tax evasion to continue with the Rockefeller Foundation's project of UN world government and forced medical tyranny.
[00:05:59.472 --> 00:06:03.356]  And he is the head man for the IBM, Rockefeller, and Carnegie money
[00:06:04.397 --> 00:06:08.762]  There was also tax exempt before his time that has been put under his control.
[00:06:09.203 --> 00:06:11.245]  So Bill Gates is incredibly powerful.
[00:06:11.566 --> 00:06:17.212]  I told people this back when I made a film, Endgame, 14 years ago, but now people say, wow, Jones, you were right.
[00:06:17.232 --> 00:06:18.955]  You said Bill Gates was so incredibly important.
[00:06:19.255 --> 00:06:19.816]  How did you know?
[00:06:21.948 --> 00:06:31.493]  In 1999, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation gave $2.2 billion to Planned Parenthood, the United Nations Population Fund, and other population reduction groups.
[00:06:32.233 --> 00:06:39.577]  By 2007, the Gates had given more than $30 billion, almost exclusively to population control groups.
[00:06:41.078 --> 00:06:48.082]  The controlled corporate press cynically reported that the Gates were giving the money to help third-world children.
[00:06:51.618 --> 00:06:53.599]  Because he heads up all the major globalist foundations.
[00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:56.520]  He was handed the baton by David Rockefeller more than 20 years ago.
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:19.023]  Klaus Schwab was trained under Henry Kissinger in a special Ph.D.
[00:07:19.063 --> 00:07:20.844]  program where only one Ph.D.
[00:07:20.904 --> 00:07:27.609]  is given a year in global governance and depopulation to carry out State Department memorandum 200 for depopulation.
[00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:30.731]  In December of 1974, the U.S.
[00:07:30.792 --> 00:07:35.355]  government made third world population reduction a central national security issue.
[00:07:36.328 --> 00:07:47.030]  The operation plan titled National Security Study Memorandum 200 was simply a regurgitation of the British Commission on Population created by King George VI of England.
[00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:49.330]  The Kissinger-authored U.S.
[00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:55.011]  plan targeted 13 key countries where massive population reduction was called for.
[00:07:55.991 --> 00:08:05.473]  Kissinger recommended that IMF and World Bank loans be given on condition that nations initiate aggressive population control programs, such as sterilization.
[00:08:06.232 --> 00:08:09.754]  I've read Klaus Schwab's book, The Great Reset COVID-19.
[00:08:10.154 --> 00:08:15.657]  I've read Ecoscience, written by Obama's science czar, and they all state the same plan.
[00:08:16.017 --> 00:08:19.599]  That's why I recognized this when they launched it a year and a half ago.
[00:08:20.059 --> 00:08:24.681]  It's called COVID-19 Project to Dominate the Planet.
[00:08:25.061 --> 00:08:29.484]  And it's all in Operation Lockstep from the Rockefeller Foundation 11 years ago.
[00:08:29.844 --> 00:08:31.765]  It's all in Crimson Contagion.
[00:08:31.805 --> 00:08:32.965]  It's all in the SPARS 2025-2028 document.
[00:08:34.662 --> 00:08:38.263]  It's all there, the battle plans to take full control of society.
[00:08:39.443 --> 00:08:40.923]  And Bill Gates says he wants privacy?
[00:08:41.363 --> 00:08:44.464]  Bill Gates says give him and his wife privacy as they get split up?
[00:08:45.964 --> 00:08:52.425]  This is the guy that wants us to have medical passports across the world controlled by the UN that private corporations share and track us with.
[00:08:52.585 --> 00:08:55.326]  This is the guy that told us we have to take five shots a year at least.
[00:08:55.506 --> 00:09:00.006]  This is the guy that put in the fake PCR test that counted all the dead from other diseases as COVID-19.
[00:09:00.227 --> 00:09:02.247]  This is the guy that financed the British and U.S.
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.041]  Thanks for watching.
[00:09:23.641 --> 00:09:29.284]  The speed of response has meant some countries are really near zero cases.
[00:09:29.304 --> 00:09:35.487]  You know, Australia, you know, China, it's quite amazing.
[00:09:35.847 --> 00:09:47.052]  And you have other countries, unfortunately, the US, very high on that list, where, you know, we're nowhere near getting to having this thing under control.
[00:09:47.072 --> 00:09:51.655]  He's an anti-American control freak, completely
[00:09:52.762 --> 00:09:53.182]  Thank you.
[00:10:13.803 --> 00:10:20.446]  And the numbers are coming out that it's causing a reaction to normal proteins in the body and that it's causing massive strokes and heart attacks and not just blood clots.
[00:10:20.706 --> 00:10:29.990]  The American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy is a non-profit organization dedicated to discovering and developing gene and cell therapies to fight disease.
[00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:38.852]  And many of our members are scientists who have spent years researching messenger RNA biology and its potential use in vaccines.
[00:10:39.532 --> 00:10:45.994]  mRNA vaccines deliver synthetic mRNA molecules into cells, instructing them to make antigens.
[00:10:46.794 --> 00:10:55.277]  An antigen is typically a foreign invader that the immune system recognizes as not being part of itself, such as the protein surface of a virus.
[00:10:55.737 --> 00:10:56.197]  So maybe
[00:10:57.318 --> 00:10:59.221]  Maybe she's starting to really find out what's going on.
[00:10:59.241 --> 00:11:00.704]  Maybe she wasn't in on it the whole time.
[00:11:00.884 --> 00:11:01.645]  I find that hard to believe.
[00:11:01.885 --> 00:11:08.536]  Or maybe the heat on the most hated man in the world, Bill Gates, a close second as Klaus Schwab, is too much for her to handle.
[00:11:09.077 --> 00:11:09.718]  But regardless...
[00:11:11.107 --> 00:11:26.515]  Both of them should stand trial for crimes against humanity and for organizing a worldwide system of corporate and medical regulators to violate the Nuremberg Code, the Helsinki Code, and other international laws on forced medical experimentation on masses of people.
[00:11:26.735 --> 00:11:33.858]  Because by the scale of what they've done already, and the adverse reactions and deaths that they've engaged in, they're well on their way to killing as many people as Hitler did.
[00:11:34.579 --> 00:11:38.741]  The real Josef Mengele of the 21st century, the real angel of death, is
[00:11:40.131 --> 00:11:40.952]  Bill Gates.
[00:11:41.553 --> 00:11:43.996]  I'm Alex Jones and this is the InfoWar.
[00:11:44.873 --> 00:12:02.778]  I know my husband is not vaccinating people and putting a microchip in her arm, because that technology doesn't even exist, and he's never uttered the words out of his mouth, so... Okay, that wasn't the reassuring pushback to a bat conspiracy theory that I had hoped for, to be honest.
[00:12:03.298 --> 00:12:09.519]  We're not microchipping people because the technology doesn't exist yet, and my husband hasn't said it out loud to me.
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.480]  Why would you put it like that?
[00:12:12.048 --> 00:12:19.554]  Although vaccines and identity may seem unrelated, Bill Gates has spent the last few years funding research that can bring the two ideas together.
[00:12:20.615 --> 00:12:30.143]  Late last year, Gates once again turned to Robert Langer and his MIT colleagues to investigate new ways to permanently store and record the vaccination information of each individual.
[00:12:31.257 --> 00:12:34.239]  The result of their research was a new vaccine delivery method.
[00:12:35.159 --> 00:12:50.249]  They found that by using dissolvable microneedles that deliver patterns of near-infrared light-emitting microparticles to the skin, they could create particle patterns in the skin of vaccine recipients which are invisible to the eye but can be imaged using modified smartphones.
[00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:57.934]  Rice University describes the quantum dot tags left behind by the microneedles as something like a barcode tattoo.
[00:12:59.795 --> 00:13:01.376]  So who was behind this development?
[00:13:02.356 --> 00:13:10.300]  As lead researcher Kevin McHugh explains, The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation came to us and said, Hey, we have a real problem.
[00:13:11.061 --> 00:13:12.281]  Knowing who's vaccinated.
[00:13:13.422 --> 00:13:15.923]  So our idea was to put the record on the person.
[00:13:16.644 --> 00:13:23.227]  This way, later on, people can scan over the area to see what vaccines have been administered and give only the ones still needed.
[00:13:24.858 --> 00:13:32.380]  The microparticles that form the fluorescent quantum dot tags are delivered along with the vaccine, but they cannot be delivered by a traditional syringe.
[00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:42.543]  Instead, they must be delivered by a patch of microneedles made from a mixture of dissolvable sugar and a polymer called PVA, as well as the quantum dot dye in the vaccine.
[00:13:43.775 --> 00:13:56.985]  It should be no surprise then, that big pharma vaccine manufacturers, in their scramble to produce the coronavirus vaccine that, Gates assures us, is necessary to go back to normal, have turned to a novel vaccine delivery method.
[00:13:57.986 --> 00:14:00.027]  A dissolvable microneedle array patch.
[00:14:03.433 --> 00:14:10.601]  What if everyone on board had their health monitored with this subdermal implant, now in late-stage testing?
[00:14:11.302 --> 00:14:20.452]  It's not some dreaded government microchip to track your every move, but a tissue-like gel engineered to continuously test your blood.
[00:14:21.033 --> 00:14:22.193]  It's a sensor.
[00:14:22.494 --> 00:14:24.194]  This tiny green thing in there?
[00:14:24.234 --> 00:14:25.715]  That tiny green thing in there.
[00:14:26.055 --> 00:14:37.740]  You put it underneath your skin, and what that tells you is that there are chemical reactions going on inside the body, and that signal means you're going to have symptoms tomorrow.
[00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:38.440]  Wow.
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.121]  There's an actual transmitter in that?
[00:14:41.421 --> 00:14:42.842]  Yeah, it's like a check engine light.
[00:14:43.142 --> 00:14:46.323]  Check this sailor out before he infects other people.
[00:14:46.483 --> 00:14:46.863]  That's right.
[00:14:55.962 --> 00:15:04.185]  I recently ran an ad where we played a Cavalry bugle call in the background, and I made the point that, hey, the Cavalry is here, but it's really true.
[00:15:04.905 --> 00:15:16.570]  Listeners are incredible, and when we're able to keep these great products in stock, we were able to fund ourselves last year and actually dig ourselves someone out of a hole that we've been in because I expanded so much for the 2020 election.
[00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:19.172]  But thanks to you, we're still on air.
[00:15:19.632 --> 00:15:28.404]  But now because of the shutdown in production and because of slowdowns, with the whole COVID lockdowns, with the supply chain, a lot of our best-selling products have not been available for months and months and months.
[00:15:28.684 --> 00:15:30.306]  Some for six months, some have been discontinued.
[00:15:30.687 --> 00:15:32.629]  But the cavalry is here now in our funding.
[00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:35.932]  Because a lot of these products are finally coming back in.
[00:15:36.372 --> 00:15:42.557]  Prostagard, Vazobeats, Alpha Power, and of course Body's Ultimate Tumor Formula are all in our top 10 best sellers.
