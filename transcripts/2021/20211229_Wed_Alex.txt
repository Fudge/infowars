[00:00:03.416 --> 00:00:06.460]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:06.600]  Think.
[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.140]  Just let me think.
[00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.947]  I suspect even now orders are being shouted into telephones and men with guns will soon be on their way.
[00:00:12.947 --> 00:00:14.328]  It's Chancellor Sutler.
[00:00:14.328 --> 00:00:15.009]  Damn it!
[00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:16.090]  Why?
[00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.954]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation,
[00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:28.483]  Words offer the means to meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth.
[00:00:28.483 --> 00:00:33.365]  And the truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[00:00:33.365 --> 00:00:34.406]  You decided, sir.
[00:00:34.406 --> 00:00:35.346]  You wanted it foolproof.
[00:00:35.346 --> 00:00:36.987]  You taught me every television in London!
[00:00:36.987 --> 00:00:40.908]  Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression.
[00:00:40.908 --> 00:00:50.892]  And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and selecting your submission.
[00:00:51.712 --> 00:00:52.233]  We're good to go.
[00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:08.580]  I know why you did it.
[00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.081]  I know you were afraid.
[00:01:10.081 --> 00:01:11.843]  Who wouldn't be?
[00:01:11.843 --> 00:01:12.063]  War?
[00:01:12.063 --> 00:01:12.703]  Terror?
[00:01:12.703 --> 00:01:14.004]  Disease?
[00:01:14.004 --> 00:01:20.448]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[00:01:20.448 --> 00:01:26.712]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[00:01:26.712 --> 00:01:33.016]  He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[00:01:39.977 --> 00:01:41.377]  There is a war.
[00:01:41.377 --> 00:01:43.278]  It's happening now.
[00:01:43.278 --> 00:01:45.658]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:01:45.658 --> 00:01:48.219]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:50.140]  We are the resistance.
[00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:59.022]  We are the Infowar.
[00:01:59.022 --> 00:02:01.703]  Hello Americans, I'm Paul Harvey.
[00:02:01.703 --> 00:02:03.363]  If I were the devil.
[00:02:04.196 --> 00:02:08.359]  If I were the Prince of Darkness, I'd want to engulf the whole world in darkness.
[00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:14.965]  And I'd have a third of its real estate and four-fifths of its population, but I wouldn't be happy until I had seized the ripest apple on the tree.
[00:02:14.965 --> 00:02:16.366]  Thee.
[00:02:17.848 --> 00:02:21.029]  So I'd set about however necessary to take over the United States.
[00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:24.869]  President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by this shooting.
[00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:26.229]  I'd subvert the churches first.
[00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:28.370]  I'd begin with a campaign of whispers.
[00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.030]  With the wisdom of a serpent, I would whisper to you as I whispered to Eve.
[00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.211]  Do as you please.
[00:02:33.211 --> 00:02:35.771]  To the young, I would whisper that the Bible is a myth.
[00:02:35.771 --> 00:02:39.652]  I would convince them that man created God instead of the other way around.
[00:02:39.652 --> 00:02:43.733]  I would confide that what's bad is good and what's good is square.
[00:02:43.733 --> 00:02:45.913]  And the old, I would teach to pray after me.
[00:02:46.853 --> 00:02:50.095]  Our father, which art in Washington.
[00:02:50.095 --> 00:02:51.315]  And then I'd get organized.
[00:02:51.315 --> 00:02:57.358]  I'd educate authors in how to make lurid literature exciting so that anything else would appear dull and uninteresting.
[00:02:57.358 --> 00:03:00.780]  I'd threaten TV with dirtier movies and vice versa.
[00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.540]  I'd peddle narcotics to whom I could.
[00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.842]  I'd sell alcohol to ladies and gentlemen of distinction.
[00:03:05.842 --> 00:03:07.703]  I'd tranquilize the rest with pills.
[00:03:09.344 --> 00:03:19.894]  If I were the devil, I'd soon have families at war with themselves, churches at war with themselves, and nations at war with themselves, until each in its turn was consumed.
[00:03:19.894 --> 00:03:25.699]  And with promises of higher ratings, I'd have mesmerizing media fanning the flames.
[00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:28.222]  The President of the United States is racist.
[00:03:28.222 --> 00:03:34.027]  If I were the devil, I would encourage schools to refine young intellects, but neglect the disciplined emotions.
[00:03:34.887 --> 00:03:35.868]  Just let those run wild.
[00:03:35.868 --> 00:03:40.870]  Within a decade, I'd have prisons overflowing, I'd have judges promoting pornography.
[00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.051]  Soon I could evict God from the courthouse, then from the schoolhouse, and then from the houses of Congress.
[00:03:46.051 --> 00:03:49.733]  And in his own churches, I would substitute psychology for religion.
[00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.992]  I would lure priests and pastors into misusing boys and girls and church money.
[00:03:56.992 --> 00:04:06.014]  If I were the devil, I'd take from those who have and give to those who wanted until I had killed the incentive of the ambitious.
[00:04:06.014 --> 00:04:07.815]  I would caution against extremes.
[00:04:07.815 --> 00:04:08.835]  I'm here to warn people!
[00:04:08.835 --> 00:04:10.396]  You keep telling me to shut up!
[00:04:10.396 --> 00:04:11.476]  This isn't a game!
[00:04:11.476 --> 00:04:14.797]  In hard work, in patriotism, in moral conduct.
[00:04:15.513 --> 00:04:23.042]  I would convince the young that marriage is old-fashioned, that swinging is more fun, that what you see on TV is the way to be.
[00:04:23.042 --> 00:04:31.531]  And thus I could undress you in public, and I could lure you into bed with diseases for which there is no cure.
[00:04:31.531 --> 00:04:34.655]  In other words, if I were the devil, I'd just keep right on doing what he's doing.
[00:04:48.883 --> 00:04:52.551]  But Antichrist is now here.
[00:04:52.551 --> 00:04:53.974]  Guard yourself well.
[00:04:53.974 --> 00:04:57.522]  Now you know the rest of the story.
[00:05:01.313 --> 00:05:03.134]  2021 has been an incredible year.
[00:05:03.134 --> 00:05:08.117]  It's been an incredible year for evil, but it's also been an amazing year for the global awakening.
[00:05:08.117 --> 00:05:10.138]  It's hard to believe it's almost over.
[00:05:10.138 --> 00:05:16.801]  Christmas 2021 is now a thing of history, and we are plunging into the most critical year, not just in U.S.
[00:05:16.801 --> 00:05:19.263]  history, but world history, in my view.
[00:05:19.263 --> 00:05:22.084]  So please continue to spread the word about InfoWars.
[00:05:22.084 --> 00:05:27.607]  Please continue to pray for the broadcast, because all of us together, including you, the viewers and listeners, are the tip of the spear.
[00:05:28.067 --> 00:05:33.510]  And take advantage of Christmas sales that will end Thursday morning.
[00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.651]  I'm cutting this on Tuesday morning.
[00:05:35.651 --> 00:05:45.797]  It's only going to run until Thursday morning, and the sale will end up to 60% off, double Patriot points, and free shipping at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:05:45.797 --> 00:05:55.542]  So thanks for keeping us on the air while getting great products at the same time, like Vitamineral Fusion, DNA Force Plus, Ultimate Bone Broth Formula, Ultimate Turmeric Formula, and so much more.
[00:05:55.802 --> 00:05:57.543]  Big Brother.
[00:05:57.543 --> 00:06:07.069]  Mainstream media.
[00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:14.253]  Government cover-ups.
[00:06:14.253 --> 00:06:16.174]  You want answers?
[00:06:16.174 --> 00:06:18.075]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:18.075 --> 00:06:24.378]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:30.939 --> 00:06:34.500]  If you're a radio listener, you didn't see that video.
[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.580]  TV viewers just saw what I talked about in front of them.
[00:06:57.441 --> 00:07:11.209]  And in ways, radio listeners are lucky, they don't have to actually witness all of this, but if you're somewhere like West Virginia or Texas or South Dakota that's not totally run by tyranny, or Florida, it's hard to believe that this is going on in America.
[00:07:11.209 --> 00:07:14.951]  But ladies and gentlemen, it is happening.
[00:07:14.951 --> 00:07:20.014]  Children crying and begging as their parents are drug out and arrested.
[00:07:20.014 --> 00:07:22.115]  This is America Under Bondage.
[00:07:25.579 --> 00:07:32.260]  I start basically every show the same way, because I just go with where my mind is, where my soul is.
[00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:39.202]  I spend, let's not exaggerate, up to seven hours a day researching.
[00:07:39.202 --> 00:07:40.802]  That's on average.
[00:07:40.802 --> 00:07:46.683]  So I got a screen time deal on my face, on my desktop, and then on the phone, and on an iPad.
[00:07:46.683 --> 00:07:49.524]  So it's about seven hours a day of reading, just on computers.
[00:07:50.774 --> 00:07:53.875]  I spend a lot of time reading stuff that's been printed off computers, so it's more than that.
[00:07:53.875 --> 00:07:56.936]  It's probably 8, 9, 10 hours a day.
[00:07:56.936 --> 00:07:58.357]  And I don't say that to impress you.
[00:07:58.357 --> 00:08:05.199]  I say that to give you the bad news.
[00:08:05.199 --> 00:08:09.921]  We're dead already.
[00:08:09.921 --> 00:08:18.164]  And I only say that so that I can get your attention, so that we can make provision for what's about to go down.
[00:08:18.164 --> 00:08:20.045]  Because that's a true statement.
[00:08:21.246 --> 00:08:24.888]  But the question is, how dead do you want to be?
[00:08:24.888 --> 00:08:29.410]  How bad do you want to get taken down before you finally realize how much trouble you're in?
[00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:38.255]  Because they don't want you to know until it's too late, and then they're going to tell you what they've done to you once you're down the rat hole.
[00:08:38.255 --> 00:08:44.458]  How many times in the last 22 months, now almost 23, this is since February of two years ago,
[00:08:46.601 --> 00:09:08.716]  How many times have I said this is an organized collapse of civilization and the destruction of confidence in our governments, in our institutions, and in our currencies, and in our churches, and in our families.
[00:09:08.716 --> 00:09:11.178]  That's why it was the number one story, it turns out, in the world.
[00:09:11.997 --> 00:09:13.539]  Not Russian troops in the U.S.
[00:09:13.539 --> 00:09:15.400]  threatening to attack Russia and Ukraine.
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.742]  That was the number one story.
[00:09:16.742 --> 00:09:20.666]  Not China threatening to invade Taiwan over the weekend.
[00:09:20.666 --> 00:09:34.559]  The number one story in the world, according to Google and Yahoo, was Alex Jones' wife mixing up medication and blacking out and attacking herself, police, you name it, and having to be restrained.
[00:09:34.559 --> 00:09:35.340]  It's a tragedy.
[00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:35.821]  It's sad.
[00:09:36.664 --> 00:09:37.524]  It's out of control.
[00:09:37.524 --> 00:09:38.804]  It's an issue I've got to deal with.
[00:09:38.804 --> 00:09:40.045]  I've been dealing with.
[00:09:40.045 --> 00:09:43.525]  But that's not the number one story in the world.
[00:09:43.525 --> 00:09:45.106]  Number one on Reddit.
[00:09:45.106 --> 00:09:46.686]  Number one on Twitter.
[00:09:46.686 --> 00:09:48.066]  Number one on Google.
[00:09:48.066 --> 00:09:49.667]  Number one on Instagram.
[00:09:49.667 --> 00:09:53.287]  Number one in the world!
[00:09:53.287 --> 00:10:01.309]  Alex Jones, his wife, on Christmas Eve, going to jail because it makes the family look bad.
[00:10:01.309 --> 00:10:03.789]  Because it makes Christmas look bad.
[00:10:03.789 --> 00:10:06.290]  Because it's an attack on the people.
[00:10:14.949 --> 00:10:17.331]  Totally disgusting.
[00:10:17.331 --> 00:10:20.374]  So let me give you the big news.
[00:10:20.374 --> 00:10:23.317]  And you know, we have an archivist who gets paid basically minimum wage.
[00:10:23.317 --> 00:10:24.078]  He's a great archivist.
[00:10:24.078 --> 00:10:25.299]  I don't know how he finds it all.
[00:10:25.299 --> 00:10:27.781]  The guy should be paid $100,000 a year for his work.
[00:10:27.781 --> 00:10:31.465]  He said he gets paid about $20,000 a year.
[00:10:31.465 --> 00:10:34.387]  And he can find stuff like a bloodhound.
[00:10:34.387 --> 00:10:40.093]  And I only go back and get these clips because it seems to get people's attention.
[00:10:41.036 --> 00:10:47.323]  It seems to wake people up out there on the internet, not just this hardcore audience that's so awake.
[00:10:47.323 --> 00:11:00.977]  And that's that I said probably a thousand times in the last two years, 22 months, probably a thousand times or more.
[00:11:02.082 --> 00:11:07.023]  That the UN, run by the globalists, is collapsing society by design for the Great Reset.
[00:11:07.023 --> 00:11:13.325]  They're going to collapse the hospitals, the borders, the third world, flood the first world with the third world collapse.
[00:11:13.325 --> 00:11:16.426]  And that that was all going to unfold.
[00:11:16.426 --> 00:11:28.869]  And that then the UN itself, that had caused the global starvation and caused the global mass death, that's 20, 30 times what COVID deaths are, would then pose as the savior and announce the need for a global
[00:11:30.629 --> 00:11:42.257]  Charter and a global Marshall Plan to take control of the world to save the collapsing third world and save the collapsing first world.
[00:11:42.257 --> 00:11:47.441]  Now, my prediction was not a prediction.
[00:11:47.441 --> 00:11:50.122]  It is 100% now come true.
[00:11:50.122 --> 00:11:51.864]  And we're now here.
[00:11:51.864 --> 00:11:55.186]  In fact, I said last year, I said by the winter of next year,
[00:11:57.381 --> 00:11:58.722]  They will announce.
[00:11:58.722 --> 00:12:00.064]  In fact, I get their timeline.
[00:12:00.064 --> 00:12:00.825]  I live this.
[00:12:00.825 --> 00:12:01.726]  I'm just in it.
[00:12:01.726 --> 00:12:03.227]  I just know it.
[00:12:03.227 --> 00:12:04.028]  Call it discernment.
[00:12:04.028 --> 00:12:05.189]  Call it research.
[00:12:05.189 --> 00:12:06.631]  It's all of those things.
[00:12:06.631 --> 00:12:10.575]  I do the research and then the discernment connects all the dots for me.
[00:12:10.575 --> 00:12:11.976]  God, the Holy Spirit.
[00:12:11.976 --> 00:12:17.882]  But you've also got to do the deep research to have all the data so then you can make sense of it.
[00:12:17.882 --> 00:12:19.464]  Then the Holy Spirit then interprets it.
[00:12:22.136 --> 00:12:28.979]  And I told you, probably 10 times the show actually, so it's probably 5,000, 10,000 times, I don't know.
[00:12:28.979 --> 00:12:34.061]  All of you listening know that I'm like a woodpecker.
[00:12:34.061 --> 00:12:36.723]  I said to you, I'm sorry you already know this.
[00:12:36.723 --> 00:12:38.904]  This is for new listeners tuning in.
[00:12:38.904 --> 00:12:40.364]  They're going to collapse the world.
[00:12:40.364 --> 00:12:42.665]  They're going to starve millions of people to death.
[00:12:42.665 --> 00:12:44.126]  They're going to bring in a new Dark Age.
[00:12:44.126 --> 00:12:44.846]  Here's their plan.
[00:12:44.846 --> 00:12:45.847]  Here's their admissions.
[00:12:45.847 --> 00:12:47.187]  This is all by design.
[00:12:47.187 --> 00:12:48.288]  We're all in great danger.
[00:12:49.127 --> 00:12:51.490]  They're not just blocking therapeutics for normal viruses.
[00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:56.094]  They're not just giving people treatment for pneumonia and the flu and letting them die and calling it COVID.
[00:12:56.094 --> 00:12:57.256]  They're bringing in eugenics.
[00:12:57.256 --> 00:12:59.037]  They're bringing in bioethics.
[00:12:59.037 --> 00:13:01.620]  They are bringing in the end of civilization.
[00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:05.364]  And then they're going to pose as the saviors while it all collapses.
[00:13:05.364 --> 00:13:07.386]  Because I've read Klaus Schwab's books.
[00:13:07.386 --> 00:13:09.809]  Because I've read Henry Kissinger's books.
[00:13:09.809 --> 00:13:11.671]  Because I've read Zbigniew Brzezinski's books.
[00:13:15.925 --> 00:13:30.853]  Zbigniew Brzezinski wrote back in the 70s that governments run and control the pedophile ranks.
[00:13:30.853 --> 00:13:32.114]  People ask how I know this.
[00:13:32.114 --> 00:13:33.055]  These criminals
[00:13:34.778 --> 00:13:38.379]  So I've got all this incredible news.
[00:13:38.379 --> 00:13:48.683]  I've got mainline studies, top pathologists confirming 93% of people who died after being vaccinated were killed by the vaccine.
[00:13:48.683 --> 00:13:55.605]  I've got just bombshell after bombshell after bombshell after bombshell.
[00:13:55.605 --> 00:13:59.866]  And I'm going to attempt next segment or two, as best I can, just to read you some headlines.
[00:13:59.866 --> 00:14:01.107]  And then I'm going to drill back into these.
[00:14:02.825 --> 00:14:04.546]  Here's what you need to know.
[00:14:04.546 --> 00:14:07.867]  This is the end of civilization as you know it.
[00:14:07.867 --> 00:14:09.727]  Every day we're on air is a blessing.
[00:14:09.727 --> 00:14:13.449]  Every day you've got even electricity and food and water is a blessing.
[00:14:13.449 --> 00:14:14.969]  I'm not trying to scare you.
[00:14:14.969 --> 00:14:17.050]  I love you and you need to get ready.
[00:14:27.003 --> 00:14:29.424]  I mean, we are in the middle of the New World Order.
[00:14:29.424 --> 00:14:31.444]  We're in the middle of the Mark of the Beast takeover.
[00:14:31.444 --> 00:14:38.467]  We are in the middle of the foretold great nightmare.
[00:14:38.467 --> 00:14:39.267]  I mean, look at this stack.
[00:14:39.267 --> 00:14:39.927]  You see this stack?
[00:14:39.927 --> 00:14:41.528]  This is one stack.
[00:14:41.528 --> 00:14:44.309]  This is one stack here out of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.
[00:14:55.476 --> 00:15:01.941]  31 stacks, not counting the video list.
[00:15:01.941 --> 00:15:06.504]  And the reason I show you all this is it's impossible to cover their attacks on you and your family.
[00:15:06.504 --> 00:15:10.287]  I mean, it is, it is just, it is unbelievable.
[00:15:10.287 --> 00:15:17.673]  And the craziest part is the people pretending they're part of the power structure and they're going to be protected during this when they're going to be destroyed.
[00:15:17.673 --> 00:15:21.676]  But let me show you this first stack as we go to break.
[00:15:21.676 --> 00:15:22.417]  This stack right here.
[00:15:24.232 --> 00:15:25.133]  You knew this was coming?
[00:15:25.133 --> 00:15:28.615]  I told you over a thousand times until my lips cracked.
[00:15:28.615 --> 00:15:32.898]  COVID tsunami will drive health systems towards collapse.
[00:15:32.898 --> 00:15:34.539]  WHO, we need trillions.
[00:15:34.539 --> 00:15:38.842]  We need you in control.
[00:15:38.842 --> 00:15:39.663]  Just say it.
[00:15:39.663 --> 00:15:44.206]  The health care system has collapsed.
[00:15:44.206 --> 00:15:47.868]  Always part of the plan.
[00:15:47.868 --> 00:15:50.030]  It's all coming up.
[00:15:52.225 --> 00:15:55.075]  Helping you navigate the apocalypse.
[00:15:55.075 --> 00:15:56.680]  This is the InfoWar.
[00:15:59.258 --> 00:16:04.780]  I'm cutting this announcement on the morning of December 28th, 2021.
[00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:14.984]  And that means you've only got until Thursday morning, or less than two days, to take advantage of the biggest sales of 2021.
[00:16:14.984 --> 00:16:21.986]  Up to 60% off on our best-selling products, double Patriot Points, and store-wide free shipping.
[00:16:21.986 --> 00:16:25.728]  DNA Force Plus is about to go off sale.
[00:16:25.728 --> 00:16:28.149]  VitaMineral Fusion is about to go off sale.
[00:16:28.965 --> 00:16:33.127]  Ultimate Bone Broth that we finally got reformulated and back in stock.
[00:16:33.127 --> 00:16:40.650]  It is going to be ending its sale along with more than 50 other products at InfoWarsTore.com and the free shipping.
[00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:47.333]  So you've got until Thursday to get the best deals of 2021 and they're gone, they're over.
[00:16:47.333 --> 00:16:51.415]  We were going to run them through to the new year but most of these products have almost sold out.
[00:16:51.415 --> 00:16:52.596]  A lot have already sold out.
[00:16:52.596 --> 00:16:53.776]  So thanks for keeping us on the air.
[00:16:53.776 --> 00:16:54.817]  These are great products.
[00:16:54.817 --> 00:16:55.757]  It's a win-win.
[00:16:55.757 --> 00:16:56.878]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:16:58.888 --> 00:17:02.291]  Not just across the United States, but across the world.
[00:17:02.291 --> 00:17:07.716]  You see it on the sides of barns, and on bumper stickers, on cars, and written on the side of bathroom walls.
[00:17:07.716 --> 00:17:09.318]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:17:09.318 --> 00:17:18.266]  That's become a maxim of people to communicate to others that they see through the fraud of the New World Order, that they're saying no to Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, and the Great Reset.
[00:17:18.266 --> 00:17:21.629]  And so now, Infowars credibility is stronger than it's ever been.
[00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:27.738]  And the globalists are now coming to try to shut us down after all their other attacks, and we can't let them do that.
[00:17:27.738 --> 00:17:30.442]  So, you've invested in Infowars over the years.
[00:17:30.442 --> 00:17:34.187]  I'm asking you to redouble those efforts now at this critical juncture.
[00:17:34.187 --> 00:17:36.951]  For everything you've done in the past is for nothing.
[00:17:37.532 --> 00:17:41.456]  You have invested in justice and the truth and hardcore populace.
[00:17:41.456 --> 00:17:43.599]  You have done incredible things.
[00:17:43.599 --> 00:17:51.247]  And I'm telling you now, going into 2022, InfoWars has major underages to run our operation and we need more funds in.
[00:17:51.247 --> 00:17:52.268]  So it's a 360 win.
[00:17:52.268 --> 00:17:55.972]  Get great products that are great for you and your family, your immune system, and so much more.
[00:17:55.972 --> 00:17:57.254]  So please go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:18:00.859 --> 00:18:02.541]  This is a great sponsor.
[00:18:02.541 --> 00:18:07.949]  We have one of the best deals you're going to find out there on a high-quality, high-rated satellite phone.
[00:18:07.949 --> 00:18:12.655]  So you can't be tracked, you can't be traced, and it'll work anywhere in the world where you can see the sky.
[00:18:12.655 --> 00:18:15.739]  You can also buy cheap antennas and things for in your car or in your house that
[00:18:15.899 --> 00:18:18.861]  Also, we're on the site, InfoWarsPhone.com.
[00:18:18.861 --> 00:18:20.362]  That's just a site that takes you to these folks.
[00:18:20.362 --> 00:18:23.243]  They supply the board for everybody with their systems as well.
[00:18:23.243 --> 00:18:31.428]  They're amazing folks, and you get a free phone, a $650 value, absolutely free, at InfoWarsPhone.com.
[00:18:31.428 --> 00:18:33.609]  Smartphones are always tracking everything you do.
[00:18:33.609 --> 00:18:34.089]  These aren't.
[00:18:34.089 --> 00:18:36.050]  And the calls are free when folks call you.
[00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:37.731]  You just pay $99.95 a month for your minutes.
[00:18:39.893 --> 00:18:41.114]  150 minutes.
[00:18:41.114 --> 00:18:42.015]  The calls here are free.
[00:18:42.015 --> 00:18:43.157]  Works like a regular cell phone.
[00:18:43.157 --> 00:18:44.479]  You're not being tracked or traced.
[00:18:44.479 --> 00:18:45.760]  And I keep one in my car.
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.603]  I've given them to my parents as gifts.
[00:18:47.603 --> 00:18:50.006]  Way out in the middle of nowhere where regular phones don't work, they work.
[00:18:50.006 --> 00:18:51.768]  Infowarsphone.com or 941-955-1020.
[00:18:51.768 --> 00:18:52.849]  941-955-1020 and ask the Alex Jones Special.
[00:18:59.406 --> 00:19:12.800]  If you're ruthless megacorporations who've taken over almost every government on earth and who are trying to destroy the middle class in any form of upward mobility, you've got to divide and conquer the public so they don't know they're being targeted.
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:20.769]  And that's why the Fortune 100 have wrapped themselves in the name of LBGT and African American rights and all the rest of it all over the world.
[00:19:21.349 --> 00:19:32.886]  That's now their corporate face while they run slave camps in Africa and in Communist China and many other areas, while they undermine our basic liberties here and spy on us through the big tech that the central banks and others own.
[00:19:33.812 --> 00:19:35.313]  So this is a criminal takeover.
[00:19:35.313 --> 00:19:46.858]  And when you look at the new superclass, it's the politicians, it's the corporate media, it's the police, it's the bureaucrats, it's members of Congress and their staff and their families, it's the White House.
[00:19:46.858 --> 00:19:56.202]  Hell, it's postal workers who were all exempt from the poison shots, but not the general public and everybody else through corporate rule.
[00:19:56.202 --> 00:19:58.143]  So this is the true discrimination that's going on.
[00:20:01.474 --> 00:20:07.379]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[00:20:23.553 --> 00:20:29.135]  I've been on air 28 years, and I've never successfully read through all my stacks on air.
[00:20:29.135 --> 00:20:33.777]  Even back then when I only had a 3-inch stack, not a foot-tall stack.
[00:20:33.777 --> 00:20:35.398]  I'm going to try right now to just hit headlines.
[00:20:35.398 --> 00:20:42.641]  I'm going to come back and hit some of the most insane gaslighting ever about Bill Gates and Anderson Cooper.
[00:20:42.641 --> 00:20:50.805]  Because a six-month-old clip of them saying, take away people's Social Security that don't take the injections, they say it as clear as day.
[00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:58.544]  Reuters, run by Pfizer, literally, said it's not real.
[00:20:58.544 --> 00:21:07.610]  I mean, again, we all know they've been all over TV saying, don't let you leave your house, take your kids away, put you in jail if you don't take it.
[00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:10.612]  It's happening all over the world.
[00:21:10.612 --> 00:21:15.916]  And then they say, oh, because opposition mounts, they have to gaslight, there's a rule they have to lie.
[00:21:15.916 --> 00:21:19.459]  So they had Reuters and everybody come out and say, it's not true, it's fake, it's not real.
[00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:21.771]  People go, wow, that's insane.
[00:21:21.771 --> 00:21:24.131]  That's a psychological warfare tactic.
[00:21:24.131 --> 00:21:29.633]  To make you debate them saying it's not real, instead of saying, hey, that's wrong.
[00:21:29.633 --> 00:21:32.575]  That's why the lie works, because you're not conscious of why they're doing it.
[00:21:32.575 --> 00:21:44.019]  They're doing it to change the subject to how CNN's a liar, or how MSNBC's a liar, or how Reuters is a liar.
[00:21:44.019 --> 00:21:47.240]  Instead of, hey, that's a global social credit score.
[00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:51.121]  Let me just calm down.
[00:21:51.121 --> 00:21:51.882]  Let me just calm down.
[00:21:51.882 --> 00:21:55.946]  You know, I always start on my right side, because this is always the top stuff.
[00:21:55.946 --> 00:21:58.688]  This is what I always tend to get to, is this strata of stacks.
[00:21:58.688 --> 00:22:00.570]  But let's just do something different.
[00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:01.891]  Let's just go over here.
[00:22:01.891 --> 00:22:03.773]  Here, let's just read these headlines.
[00:22:03.773 --> 00:22:10.759]  New York Governor Drops COVID Vax Requirements for Transportation Workers, Citing Crew Shortages.
[00:22:10.759 --> 00:22:14.782]  Aaron Rodgers, Science That Can't Be Questioned Is Propaganda.
[00:22:14.782 --> 00:22:16.003]  It's more than propaganda.
[00:22:16.003 --> 00:22:16.484]  It's tyranny.
[00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:22.733]  Rand Paul, thousands dying every month because of Fauci's obsession with pushing vaccines.
[00:22:22.733 --> 00:22:25.796]  He's starting to creep closer to the truth.
[00:22:25.796 --> 00:22:30.519]  CNN lost another 38% of its viewers in 2021.
[00:22:30.519 --> 00:22:32.660]  Their average show has 700,000 viewers.
[00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:34.462]  They are beyond a joke.
[00:22:34.462 --> 00:22:41.387]  And Fairfax County Police confirmed Jake Tapper's production under investigation for child exploitation rings.
[00:22:41.387 --> 00:22:42.207]  Yep.
[00:22:42.207 --> 00:22:43.188]  Told ya.
[00:22:43.188 --> 00:22:43.688]  They run rings.
[00:22:45.265 --> 00:22:47.828]  You're not even in the club unless you feed on children.
[00:22:47.828 --> 00:22:50.952]  You don't get in the club unless you rape our future.
[00:22:50.952 --> 00:22:51.313]  Told you.
[00:22:53.246 --> 00:22:54.546]  That's just part of that stack.
[00:22:54.546 --> 00:22:56.107]  We've got a bunch over here.
[00:22:56.107 --> 00:22:57.227]  Oh, here's a big one.
[00:22:57.227 --> 00:22:58.848]  This one's really important.
[00:22:58.848 --> 00:23:04.970]  Heavens above, NASA endless priests prepare for an alien discovery, the Times of London says.
[00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:06.191]  Yep, Project Bluebeam.
[00:23:06.191 --> 00:23:10.132]  It's one of their next big deals after the big fake cyber attack that's coming.
[00:23:10.132 --> 00:23:15.474]  I mean, it'll turn your computer off and your internet off and turn your power off in most areas, but it's staged by them.
[00:23:17.014 --> 00:23:18.075]  That's coming up.
[00:23:18.075 --> 00:23:21.558]  Oh, look at this nice little stacky here.
[00:23:21.558 --> 00:23:27.923]  How dumb you gotta be to fall for media gaslighting still, says Anomaly on Twitter.
[00:23:27.923 --> 00:23:31.666]  And they've got all these headlines from a year ago.
[00:23:31.666 --> 00:23:32.847]  Alex Jones is insane.
[00:23:32.847 --> 00:23:37.010]  Nobody's planning to put a microchip in you to buy and sell over a COVID passport.
[00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:38.432]  Of course, it was officially from the UN.
[00:23:38.432 --> 00:23:39.372]  That's why we knew it.
[00:23:39.372 --> 00:23:44.136]  And then a year later, the exact same Sun newspaper says microchips to prove you've had your vaccine.
[00:23:44.136 --> 00:23:44.757]  You must take them.
[00:23:46.636 --> 00:23:50.058]  By the way, when I say these are stacks, each one of these.
[00:23:50.058 --> 00:23:52.220]  Oh, here they are!
[00:23:52.220 --> 00:24:02.987]  Months and months before COVID was released in early 2020, the NIH had a grant for the COVID-19 SARS exact virus for a biodefense operation.
[00:24:02.987 --> 00:24:03.167]  Hmm.
[00:24:06.584 --> 00:24:09.806]  Remember Trump said everything woke turns to SH-T?
[00:24:09.806 --> 00:24:11.327]  Yeah, including you.
[00:24:11.327 --> 00:24:12.428]  Now joining them.
[00:24:12.428 --> 00:24:18.712]  Hollywood elites panic by armored cars and safe rooms amid rising violent crime.
[00:24:18.712 --> 00:24:21.534]  Again, I'm just reading the top articles of each stack here.
[00:24:21.534 --> 00:24:26.297]  China introduces AI prosecutor that can automatically charge citizens with a crime.
[00:24:26.297 --> 00:24:27.638]  You want to know the future?
[00:24:27.638 --> 00:24:28.618]  This is it.
[00:24:28.618 --> 00:24:29.599]  That's coming up.
[00:24:29.599 --> 00:24:34.202]  Then I got two big stacks of quotes by world leaders saying they're going to kill you and your family.
[00:24:34.202 --> 00:24:35.123]  I'm going to get to that today.
[00:24:36.226 --> 00:24:38.147]  That's just one of the folders.
[00:24:38.147 --> 00:24:39.748]  There's three folders right there.
[00:24:39.748 --> 00:24:41.409]  Oh, here, let's start going into this.
[00:24:41.409 --> 00:24:45.091]  Just the top articles in these stratas.
[00:24:45.091 --> 00:24:51.414]  Pathology results show 93% of people who died after being vaccinated were killed by the vaccine.
[00:24:51.414 --> 00:25:00.599]  Mainline studies have an investigative journalist and tech famous inventor joining us in the third hour to break down this nightmare information.
[00:25:03.482 --> 00:25:12.545]  Continuing, VAERS COVID vaccine data shows surge in reports of serious injuries and deaths as five-year-olds start getting the shots.
[00:25:12.545 --> 00:25:15.626]  And we've actually got the VAERS reports for you.
[00:25:15.626 --> 00:25:18.167]  And we're actually going to go over those.
[00:25:18.167 --> 00:25:21.988]  We're going to actually show you directly from the federal government's own website.
[00:25:21.988 --> 00:25:25.049]  Because unlike CNN, we show you.
[00:25:25.049 --> 00:25:30.111]  Then I've got a big stack of the news predicting we'd all be underwater by the year 2000 and the year 2013 and the year 2017.
[00:25:33.985 --> 00:25:36.467]  We have a stack of those articles we'll be getting to.
[00:25:36.467 --> 00:25:48.617]  Also, something I've pointed out many times is my family does own a couple hundred head of cattle, and we barely make enough money to pay the property taxes on a ranch we got in a land grant from the Mexicans in 1829.
[00:25:48.617 --> 00:25:51.599]  We're still paying tax on it.
[00:25:51.599 --> 00:26:00.807]  And we pay all of it into property taxes, and a lot of times, family has to then pay extra money in just to do it.
[00:26:01.792 --> 00:26:03.352]  And that's a New York Times article.
[00:26:03.352 --> 00:26:06.953]  Record beef prices, but ranchers aren't cashing in!
[00:26:06.953 --> 00:26:13.395]  I mean, used to you could go to a regular steakhouse on the side of the highway for 20 bucks, get a T-bone.
[00:26:13.395 --> 00:26:16.576]  Now at the place that's got the crappy meat, it's 50 bucks.
[00:26:16.576 --> 00:26:23.498]  Everything is a scam, because it's all controlled by computers and AI at the top, at the meatpacking facilities.
[00:26:23.498 --> 00:26:25.379]  Continuing.
[00:26:25.379 --> 00:26:28.459]  Talking about collapse, this ties into where we're going to come back and cover.
[00:26:28.459 --> 00:26:30.000]  Vaccine mandate causes
[00:26:31.496 --> 00:26:35.417]  Health care worker shortages and now the CDC is panicking.
[00:26:35.417 --> 00:26:41.899]  Oh, they have the military martial law taking it over and then emergency funding kicks into the hospital groups.
[00:26:41.899 --> 00:26:43.359]  The smaller groups go bankrupt.
[00:26:43.359 --> 00:26:44.559]  They can't get help.
[00:26:44.559 --> 00:26:48.580]  But then the bigger ones make record profits.
[00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:53.062]  That's all part of the organized global collapse we're talking about.
[00:26:53.062 --> 00:26:57.663]  So I'm at least reading the top article out of each stack.
[00:26:57.663 --> 00:26:58.563]  Let's continue here.
[00:26:59.577 --> 00:27:05.021]  With today's show headline that's on Infowars.com.
[00:27:05.021 --> 00:27:10.345]  WHO warns of global health care collapse that they triggered with COVID hysteria.
[00:27:10.345 --> 00:27:20.352]  Meanwhile, Bill Gates and fellow blue blood, Anderson Cooper, promote taking Social Security from Americans who refuse the deadly gene therapy injections.
[00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:44.346]  Tune in to this must-see broadcast when Alex Jones and leading computer scientist, investigative journalist, Steve Kirsch, as they expose the latest COVID tyranny developments, including the fact that 93% of people who died after being vaccinated were killed by the vaccine in their own VAERS data analysis by a major respected statistician company.
[00:27:44.346 --> 00:27:49.107]  I mean, but again, the news doesn't tell you you're being murdered, so you just, people are tough.
[00:27:49.107 --> 00:27:50.047]  They're like, well, we'll take it.
[00:27:52.972 --> 00:27:55.074]  As they slaughter us.
[00:27:55.074 --> 00:27:56.176]  As they kill us.
[00:27:56.176 --> 00:27:59.199]  Now, again, I just read the top stories there.
[00:27:59.199 --> 00:28:00.160]  Not into the stacks.
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:04.005]  When I come back, you did a pretty good job getting to that.
[00:28:04.005 --> 00:28:09.211]  I'm going to drill into the world-designed economic collapse and medical collapse.
[00:28:10.239 --> 00:28:25.385]  And they're going to call the financial collapse a medical collapse and use that as the face-saving excuse of the globalists who will then offer you the global social credit score that they're now on every channel, every CNN, ABC, NBC, everywhere.
[00:28:25.385 --> 00:28:27.265]  Oh, your global social credit score is here.
[00:28:27.265 --> 00:28:30.086]  Oh, everything will finally be free and be wonderful.
[00:28:30.086 --> 00:28:30.987]  Everything collapsed.
[00:28:30.987 --> 00:28:31.807]  It's not your fault.
[00:28:31.807 --> 00:28:33.348]  Years of lockdown happened.
[00:28:33.348 --> 00:28:34.428]  Now you're going to get a check.
[00:28:34.428 --> 00:28:39.650]  And I'm going to explain why that's so deadly and why that's the end of the road and the beginning of real enslavement.
[00:28:40.538 --> 00:28:46.784]  When we come back, this is one hell of a broadcast, and what the lockdowns have done to children.
[00:28:46.784 --> 00:28:50.328]  Lower their IQs massively by design.
[00:28:50.328 --> 00:28:52.750]  Brain damage.
[00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:53.811]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:53.811 --> 00:28:55.372]  Infowars.com.
[00:28:55.372 --> 00:28:56.494]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:28:59.261 --> 00:29:09.853]  Well, if InfoWars was battle-hardened and wounded and punished and tortured and demonized and lied about in the last 20-plus years, we've really gone through
[00:29:10.939 --> 00:29:12.920]  The most destructive year we've ever seen.
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:15.160]  But so is the country, so is the world.
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:18.581]  And InfoWars intends to go into the thick of the fight.
[00:29:18.581 --> 00:29:20.082]  We intend to get attacked.
[00:29:20.082 --> 00:29:21.943]  We also intend to win.
[00:29:21.943 --> 00:29:24.303]  But we can't do that without working together.
[00:29:24.303 --> 00:29:29.065]  So I wanted to thank all of you in this insane year of 2021 for your support.
[00:29:29.645 --> 00:29:31.987]  And for your promotion of liberty and freedom.
[00:29:31.987 --> 00:29:36.750]  And I want to encourage you all to understand that we're not backing down and the Great Awakening is here.
[00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:38.391]  That's why the globalists are so scared.
[00:29:38.391 --> 00:29:41.853]  And I want to encourage you to take advantage of the best deals of the year.
[00:29:41.853 --> 00:29:46.336]  We were going to extend through the 1st, but we're selling out of basically everything.
[00:29:46.336 --> 00:29:49.598]  So we have to end the sales Thursday morning.
[00:29:49.598 --> 00:29:51.679]  So I'm cutting this on Tuesday morning.
[00:29:51.679 --> 00:29:57.883]  That means there's just two days left to get storewide free shipping, double pay three points, up to 60% off at InfoWareStore.com
[00:29:59.033 --> 00:30:08.795]  Since the end of World War II, the globalists have been building their private corporate world government, whose endgame, once they get control, is forced depopulation of the planet.
[00:30:08.795 --> 00:30:19.558]  That's why as we begin to leave the year 2021 and go into 2022, I am encouraging all of you out there watching and listening to count the cost and to realize how much danger you and your family are in.
[00:30:19.558 --> 00:30:21.318]  The globalists are coming after everybody.
[00:30:21.678 --> 00:30:26.440]  They are setting up a dystopic, planetary, authoritarian technocracy.
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:28.901]  A dictatorship of the globalists.
[00:30:28.901 --> 00:30:31.322]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:30:31.322 --> 00:30:36.324]  Your investment in us over the years, buying our products, spreading the word, praying for us, has been incredible.
[00:30:36.324 --> 00:30:37.365]  But I'm telling you right now,
[00:30:37.685 --> 00:30:41.927]  We're about to lose not just InfoWars, but the entire country and the world to tyranny.
[00:30:41.927 --> 00:30:45.529]  So now, everything you've done in the past needs to be redoubled today.
[00:30:45.529 --> 00:30:51.212]  And InfoWarsTore.com is one of the most important places you can go to buy great products and fund the tip of the spear.
[00:30:51.212 --> 00:30:52.373]  I will go down with the ship.
[00:30:52.373 --> 00:30:53.373]  I'm not going to back down.
[00:30:53.373 --> 00:30:55.114]  I'm getting even more hardcore in their face.
[00:30:55.114 --> 00:30:57.595]  But I can't stay in the fight at 100% unless you support us.
[00:30:57.595 --> 00:30:58.756]  So please go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:30:59.096 --> 00:31:02.797]  Everything I do is about victory for humanity.
[00:31:02.797 --> 00:31:08.659]  Everything I promote is about standing up against the New World Order by empowering humanity.
[00:31:08.659 --> 00:31:10.860]  Well, that's why ResetWars.com is so important.
[00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:25.404]  Not only is it a game-changing course of critical information to unlock your mind from the Matrix, but it's something that gets around Klaus Schwab's attempt to shut down American infrastructure and American jobs.
[00:31:26.124 --> 00:31:28.327]  It is the true digital economy.
[00:31:28.327 --> 00:31:33.492]  It's the spiritual economy of the mind and transcendental control.
[00:31:33.492 --> 00:31:34.113]  I've been on air 28 years.
[00:31:35.202 --> 00:31:41.563]  And all of our work has been amazing, thanks to God and God's divine empowerment and blessing.
[00:31:41.563 --> 00:31:47.485]  But I got to tell you, out of everything I've done, Reset Wars is the most important, and it is now available.
[00:31:47.485 --> 00:31:52.206]  Now, the month of December 2021 is here at ResetWars.com.
[00:31:52.206 --> 00:31:56.306]  Start your journey to the next level today at ResetWars.com.
[00:31:56.306 --> 00:31:58.607]  The globalists fear this information.
[00:31:59.247 --> 00:32:02.129]  It's time to protect your privacy.
[00:32:02.129 --> 00:32:16.098]  It's time to come to grips with the fact that even though you don't have anything to hide, criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech, government are stealing all of your data and creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do.
[00:32:16.098 --> 00:32:20.561]  So in the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down.
[00:32:20.561 --> 00:32:28.907]  Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts, protecting your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount.
[00:32:29.407 --> 00:32:32.149]  That's why everybody should visit InfoWarsTore.com.

[00:32:52.599 --> 00:32:53.680]  Check out the new line.
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:54.240]  It's amazing.
[00:33:00.618 --> 00:33:17.695]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[00:33:17.695 --> 00:33:23.600]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[00:33:24.471 --> 00:33:32.455]  Alright, so I get really upset when I sit here and I read all this news and I know I talk really fast and sometimes that's not my best show.
[00:33:32.455 --> 00:33:37.337]  But I'm really trying to get people to understand the urgency of this.
[00:33:37.337 --> 00:33:53.584]  So during this last break, I was sitting here looking at news headlines and reading new information coming in and I was really asking myself, should you even be on the air at this point or should you just be getting yourself
[00:33:54.625 --> 00:33:59.586]  And you're family ready because I've got family problems because I'm not home as much as I should be.
[00:33:59.586 --> 00:34:01.006]  And you know, the world's falling apart.
[00:34:01.006 --> 00:34:02.527]  I know you've all got problems as well.
[00:34:02.527 --> 00:34:10.568]  All the statistics show we've got more problems, more depression, more suicide, more violence, more drug use, more everything ever in history.
[00:34:10.568 --> 00:34:12.148]  I've said I'm not perfect.
[00:34:12.148 --> 00:34:13.169]  My family's not perfect.
[00:34:13.169 --> 00:34:14.869]  We got problems just like you.
[00:34:14.869 --> 00:34:18.730]  I'm a regular person just like you.
[00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:20.210]  Should I even be on the air at this point?
[00:34:21.502 --> 00:34:29.206]  And yes, the answer is yes, we need to be here and a beacon of truth into this key time where we're going to decide which side we're on.
[00:34:29.206 --> 00:34:48.597]  That said, though, I began to cogitate, to reflect, to really assess during the break what is most important out of everything I've got here in front of me to say, because you don't want to miss the forest for the trees.
[00:34:48.597 --> 00:34:49.057]  And it's this.
[00:34:51.917 --> 00:34:55.758]  Our problem is not Klaus Schwab.
[00:34:55.758 --> 00:34:59.219]  Our problem is not Bill Gates.
[00:34:59.219 --> 00:35:06.260]  Our problem is not Ted Turner or George Soros or Anderson Cooper, who's even richer than they are.
[00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:17.342]  Our, our problem, our problem is not even Donald Trump.
[00:35:17.342 --> 00:35:20.263]  Our problem is not Senator Paul.
[00:35:22.543 --> 00:35:25.205]  Our problem is ours.
[00:35:25.205 --> 00:35:35.332]  Because we're not making the people that are on the fence that we've elected to be our representatives and our guardians do their damn jobs.
[00:35:35.332 --> 00:35:42.317]  So, Rand Paul endorsed this gene therapy and wanted to get the economy open and thought it was the right thing to do.
[00:35:43.095 --> 00:35:44.355]  I believe Rand Paul's a good guy.
[00:35:44.355 --> 00:35:45.696]  In fact, at a gut level, I know he is.
[00:35:45.696 --> 00:35:48.896]  But he knows now this is a deadly gene therapy in killing people.
[00:35:48.896 --> 00:35:51.597]  And he's still not attacking the shot.
[00:35:51.597 --> 00:35:58.958]  He's just saying, hey, instead of saying the shot, people really need vitamin C and vitamin D and zinc and iodine.
[00:35:58.958 --> 00:36:01.579]  And he's out saying that.
[00:36:01.579 --> 00:36:06.760]  He's in an interview saying, you know, obsessing on the vaccine that isn't really 100 percent, it's kind of killing people.
[00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:08.340]  You need to be healthy.
[00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:10.240]  That's what Joe Rogan's saying.
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:12.581]  But Joe's going all the way saying the shot's hurting people.
[00:36:13.581 --> 00:36:14.761]  Rand Paul's not doing that.
[00:36:14.761 --> 00:36:19.123]  And so I was thinking about this this morning when I woke up about 5 a.m.
[00:36:19.123 --> 00:36:20.943]  I was like, am I right to be really going after Trump?
[00:36:20.943 --> 00:36:22.764]  And I'm like, yeah, you are right to be going after him.
[00:36:22.764 --> 00:36:24.044]  He knows what's going on.
[00:36:24.044 --> 00:36:30.526]  Then I thought, Rand Paul's a medical doctor and he's super smart.
[00:36:30.526 --> 00:36:36.348]  And I've known the guy for 28 years and he knows damn well what's going on.
[00:36:36.348 --> 00:36:38.169]  So let me say this.
[00:36:39.833 --> 00:36:47.241]  If I said Trump's either super ignorant or one of the most evil men to ever live to do this to his own people, and obviously I meant that to get Trump's attention.
[00:36:47.241 --> 00:36:48.322]  I don't think he's ignorant.
[00:36:48.322 --> 00:36:50.044]  I don't think he wants to be evil.
[00:36:50.044 --> 00:36:52.847]  I just think he's lying to himself and rationalizing.
[00:36:52.847 --> 00:36:55.130]  But regardless, we're still in the position we are.
[00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:58.534]  Trump could come out against this and we'd end this very quickly.
[00:36:58.534 --> 00:37:00.235]  But what about Rand Paul, huh?
[00:37:01.095 --> 00:37:03.036]  No, I don't want to break his ribs.
[00:37:03.036 --> 00:37:06.118]  I don't want to shoot at him like a Democrat does.
[00:37:06.118 --> 00:37:13.322]  In fact, I want to support him and campaign for him and hope he becomes president someday.
[00:37:13.322 --> 00:37:25.549]  But whatever calculus he's got, whatever math is going on in his head of why he's not coming out against this thing all the way, when the numbers and the facts are 100% clear, is a big problem.
[00:37:25.549 --> 00:37:29.151]  And so, I want to apologize to President Trump.
[00:37:30.233 --> 00:37:33.555]  And that's backhanded, folks.
[00:37:33.555 --> 00:37:41.258]  And that if I'm really mad at him, I should be a lot more mad at Senator Paul.
[00:37:41.258 --> 00:37:53.984]  And all the people that are so critical of Trump pushing warp speed and the rest of it, which is legitimate and is good, and I'm proud of folks that did that.
[00:37:53.984 --> 00:37:55.145]  Great job.
[00:37:55.145 --> 00:37:56.986]  Well, you should spend a little time on Rand Paul.
[00:37:58.914 --> 00:38:20.792]  Not because we're trying to assess blame here, but because we're trying to get the governors and the legislators and the House and Senate members and the judiciary to have some damn common sense and some self-preservation instincts here and turn this ship around.
[00:38:20.792 --> 00:38:23.895]  We are going the wrong direction.
[00:38:26.385 --> 00:38:35.571]  So I can talk all day about the problems, but I think this audience of millions is as informed as I am and in many ways more informed.
[00:38:35.571 --> 00:38:36.952]  And don't you agree with me, listeners?
[00:38:38.041 --> 00:38:41.344]  We'll open the phones up next hour and take your calls.
[00:38:41.344 --> 00:38:43.246]  How do we end this Great Reset?
[00:38:43.246 --> 00:38:44.307]  How do we stop this?
[00:38:44.307 --> 00:38:47.590]  How do we... Do we focus on Biden the puppet?
[00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:50.272]  Do we focus on Bill Gates, which we've already done?
[00:38:50.272 --> 00:38:52.214]  Do we attack the people behind it all?
[00:38:52.214 --> 00:38:58.700]  Or do we go after politically, peacefully, the people that say they represent us?
[00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:00.382]  It'd be like if I was six, seven years old,
[00:39:04.022 --> 00:39:12.484]  And some bully from down the street, he was like 14, took my bike away, kicked me off of it.
[00:39:12.484 --> 00:39:15.445]  And my dad didn't start a big fight with the guy's dad down the street.
[00:39:15.445 --> 00:39:17.305]  They lived about 20 houses down.
[00:39:17.305 --> 00:39:18.565]  My dad said, which house is it?
[00:39:18.565 --> 00:39:18.905]  Where is it?
[00:39:18.905 --> 00:39:20.306]  My dad went and knocked on the door.
[00:39:20.306 --> 00:39:24.387]  Some big meathead comes to the door and says, I want my son's bike back, please.
[00:39:24.387 --> 00:39:26.247]  The guy kind of a little bit threatening.
[00:39:26.247 --> 00:39:30.468]  And my dad just said, you're going to give me that bike right now.
[00:39:31.527 --> 00:39:32.468]  You're going to get hurt.
[00:39:32.468 --> 00:39:34.449]  And the guy listening went and got it.
[00:39:34.449 --> 00:39:38.573]  But the point was is that we're kind of like the kids here.
[00:39:38.573 --> 00:39:42.356]  You know, we're the people and we elect these men to go represent us.
[00:39:42.356 --> 00:39:46.279]  And we're watching the globalists not steal our bike, but kill us.
[00:39:46.279 --> 00:39:50.983]  And what are these people doing?
[00:39:53.188 --> 00:39:54.709]  To protect us.
[00:39:54.709 --> 00:39:59.291]  So when they don't protect us, they become our betrayers.
[00:39:59.291 --> 00:40:02.193]  And they're then worse than Fauci and worse than Bill Gates.
[00:40:02.193 --> 00:40:04.714]  Because we know Fauci's a mass murdering criminal.
[00:40:04.714 --> 00:40:08.476]  We know Bill Gates is a psychotic eugenicist piece of garbage.
[00:40:08.476 --> 00:40:10.677]  We know who they are.
[00:40:10.677 --> 00:40:19.402]  But we're not going to sit here and put up with Josh Hawley or Ted Cruz or any of these people.
[00:40:19.402 --> 00:40:21.043]  But Rand Paul's chief amongst them.
[00:40:24.645 --> 00:40:26.466]  Yeah, we all wish Trump would do the right thing.
[00:40:26.466 --> 00:40:28.767]  But listen, I've got the inside baseball on Trump.
[00:40:28.767 --> 00:40:30.447]  He doesn't know what's going on.
[00:40:30.447 --> 00:40:31.628]  And I'm not even defending Trump.
[00:40:31.628 --> 00:40:33.728]  I'm just saying we need to move on.
[00:40:33.728 --> 00:40:39.611]  In fact, maybe, you know what, to get Trump's attention, because I don't even get this from Roger Stone.
[00:40:39.611 --> 00:40:41.811]  I get this from people directly in Trump's camp.
[00:40:41.811 --> 00:40:43.652]  Maybe I should just dish all the dirt on.
[00:40:43.652 --> 00:40:44.753]  You know what?
[00:40:44.753 --> 00:40:45.313]  You know what?
[00:40:45.313 --> 00:40:48.514]  I'm going to dish it all on Trump next hour.
[00:40:48.514 --> 00:40:49.794]  I'm gonna go ahead and do that.
[00:40:49.794 --> 00:40:50.895]  And it's not to hurt Trump.
[00:40:51.698 --> 00:40:57.564]  It's so people can know how pathetic he is when you think he's playing 40 chess gonna save you and he's not.
[00:40:57.564 --> 00:40:58.705]  He's not a bad guy!
[00:41:00.054 --> 00:41:17.127]  But he doesn't know what he's doing, and he's surrounded by bad advisors, and he's got that multi-billion dollar social media network based on Mastodon that they said is an original program and doesn't even work, and there's all these SEC criminal investigations of it right now, and it's all falling apart.
[00:41:17.127 --> 00:41:19.169]  I wish Trump could go build a real network.
[00:41:19.169 --> 00:41:20.770]  I want Trump to have success.
[00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:21.631]  I'm not against Trump.
[00:41:22.659 --> 00:41:26.460]  Well, just like during the campaign a year and a half ago, I told you Trump's in trouble.
[00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:27.180]  He's gonna lose.
[00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:28.281]  They're gonna steal it.
[00:41:28.281 --> 00:41:29.341]  Here's how they're gonna do it.
[00:41:29.341 --> 00:41:31.242]  Oh, Alex, we're invincible.
[00:41:31.242 --> 00:41:43.885]  We've got Q. And I told you it was BS not to sit there and create doubt, but to create resolve, to get involved, that the game was very close, that we were starting to lose the fight.
[00:41:43.885 --> 00:41:48.507]  And you can't just sit there on the bleacher thinking you've won because 8chan told you so.
[00:41:49.307 --> 00:41:51.608]  Was A-Chan right or was Alex Jones right?
[00:41:51.608 --> 00:41:57.290]  Was Q right or was Alex Jones right?
[00:41:57.290 --> 00:42:00.632]  Maybe I don't even want to talk about us.
[00:42:00.632 --> 00:42:03.373]  Because there's two schools of thoughts.
[00:42:03.373 --> 00:42:07.694]  I could sit here and just cover all this crap they're doing to us all day long.
[00:42:07.694 --> 00:42:16.898]  Or I could talk about the people that say they represent us
[00:42:19.525 --> 00:42:23.058]  As the worldwide collapse accelerates, not doing a damn thing.
[00:42:25.365 --> 00:42:30.166]  But just kind of window dressing and kind of eating around the corners of the problem.
[00:42:30.166 --> 00:42:31.466]  We're in a great reset.
[00:42:31.466 --> 00:42:32.887]  We're in a globalist takeover.
[00:42:32.887 --> 00:42:35.087]  We're in a design collapse.
[00:42:35.087 --> 00:42:40.728]  And if you don't address that head-on, you are working for the other side.
[00:42:40.728 --> 00:42:41.388]  Period.
[00:42:41.388 --> 00:42:46.009]  I'm not risking my life and my treasure and my name and everything else up here to lose, folks.
[00:42:46.009 --> 00:42:48.950]  I'm not up here to be part of the candy-ass Republican Party.
[00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:50.750]  I'm not here to be part of the system.
[00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:54.171]  I'm here to bring their evil system down and relaunch the Republic.
[00:42:54.171 --> 00:42:54.631]  Stay with us.
[00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:05.281]  I'm cutting this announcement on the morning of December 28th, 2021.
[00:43:05.281 --> 00:43:09.249]  And that means you've only got until Thursday morning.
[00:43:09.946 --> 00:43:13.729]  Or less than two days to take advantage of the biggest sales of 2021.
[00:43:13.729 --> 00:43:22.496]  Up to 60% off on our best-selling products, double Patriot points, and store-wide free shipping.
[00:43:22.496 --> 00:43:26.219]  DNA Force Plus is about to go off sale.
[00:43:26.219 --> 00:43:28.661]  VitaMineral Fusion is about to go off sale.
[00:43:30.748 --> 00:43:33.609]  Bone broth that we finally got reformulated back in stock.
[00:43:33.609 --> 00:43:41.150]  It is going to be ending its sale along with more than 50 other products at InfoWarsTore.com and the free shipping.
[00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:47.831]  So you've got until Thursday to get the best deals of 2021 and they're gone, they're over.
[00:43:47.831 --> 00:43:51.912]  We were going to run them through to the new year, but most of these products have almost sold out.
[00:43:51.912 --> 00:43:53.092]  A lot have already sold out.
[00:43:53.092 --> 00:43:54.272]  So thanks for keeping us on the air.
[00:43:54.272 --> 00:43:55.293]  These are great products.
[00:43:55.293 --> 00:43:57.353]  It's a win-win InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:12.636]  The average person on the face of this incredible planet is still unaware that there's a war between free individuals and nation states on one side, and the globalists on the other, who are literally trying to create a post-human world.
[00:44:13.336 --> 00:44:21.119]  For the United States of Brazil, and of course triggered by the Brexit in the UK, nations were pulling out of the private, corporate, and fascist world government.
[00:44:21.119 --> 00:44:28.341]  That's why they launched their Great Reset, and their program after collapsing us, of Build Back Better.
[00:44:28.341 --> 00:44:34.183]  This is nothing more than a top-down, vertical consolidation of the world economy.
[00:44:34.183 --> 00:44:41.246]  And because they couldn't take our guns, and because we wouldn't bow, because the left, which is the ideology of this world government system, couldn't win,
[00:44:42.166 --> 00:44:45.187]  They released a biological weapon on us.
[00:44:45.187 --> 00:44:47.247]  Now we know, two years ago.
[00:44:47.247 --> 00:44:49.508]  We learned about it about 20 months ago.
[00:44:49.508 --> 00:44:50.108]  It's that simple.
[00:44:50.108 --> 00:44:53.189]  They can't beat us because of our free speech and our guns.
[00:44:53.189 --> 00:44:57.390]  So the Global Corporate Combine released COVID-19, and you know the rest is history.
[00:44:57.390 --> 00:45:00.771]  Expose this paradigm, and we win.
[00:45:00.771 --> 00:45:07.893]  I have the greatest sense of loss, deep in my heart, deep in my soul, I've ever had in my 47 years on this planet.
[00:45:07.893 --> 00:45:10.394]  I've had a lot of loss, like everybody else has.
[00:45:11.542 --> 00:45:24.411]  And it's because it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people fought and died and bled and sweat for.
[00:45:24.411 --> 00:45:26.113]  And now we're just throwing it all away.
[00:45:27.944 --> 00:45:36.106]  And I see the general public in a medically-induced, scientifically-induced, behavioral, psychologically-controlled tranche.
[00:45:36.106 --> 00:45:41.187]  And I know we're being fed into this globalist meat grinder, and it's so incredibly sad.
[00:45:41.187 --> 00:45:50.889]  But this is the process of birth, and then growth, and then falling apart, and then degenerating and collapsing, and then coming back to life again.
[00:45:52.066 --> 00:45:59.251]  It's just the globalists are actively trying to steer and control this process of decadence and collapse to actually end the species as we know it.
[00:45:59.571 --> 00:46:02.974]  Not just across the United States, but across the world.
[00:46:02.974 --> 00:46:08.419]  You see it on the sides of barns, and on bumper stickers on cars, and written on the side of bathroom walls.
[00:46:08.419 --> 00:46:10.020]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:18.968]  That's become a maxim of people to communicate to others that they see through the fraud of the New World Order, that they're saying no to Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, and the Great Reset.
[00:46:18.968 --> 00:46:22.331]  And so now, InfoWars credibility is stronger than it's ever been.
[00:46:22.952 --> 00:46:28.436]  And the globalists are now coming to try to shut us down after all their other attacks, and we can't let them do that.
[00:46:28.436 --> 00:46:31.118]  So, you've invested in Infowars over the years.
[00:46:31.118 --> 00:46:37.643]  I'm asking you to redouble those efforts now at this critical juncture, or everything you've done in the past is for nothing.
[00:46:38.263 --> 00:46:42.064]  You have invested in justice and the truth and hardcore populace.
[00:46:42.064 --> 00:46:44.304]  You have done incredible things.
[00:46:44.304 --> 00:46:51.925]  And I'm telling you now, going in 2022, InfoWars has major underages to run our operation and we need more funds in.
[00:46:51.925 --> 00:46:52.966]  So it's a 360 win.
[00:46:52.966 --> 00:46:56.766]  Get great products that are great for you and your family, your immune system, and so much more.
[00:46:56.766 --> 00:47:00.827]  So please go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:47:00.827 --> 00:47:05.448]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:47:05.448 --> 00:47:06.728]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:15.401 --> 00:47:20.506]  Ladies and gentlemen, on this live Wednesday, December 29th, 2021 transmission.
[00:47:20.506 --> 00:47:24.590]  Let me pay some bills right now.

[00:47:28.905 --> 00:47:34.290]  The sale will end tonight at midnight, because all these products are about to sell out.
[00:47:34.290 --> 00:47:36.072]  In fact, many of them are off the list now.
[00:47:36.072 --> 00:47:36.792]  They have sold out.
[00:47:36.792 --> 00:47:39.155]  Storewide free shipping, double patriot points.
[00:47:39.155 --> 00:47:41.257]  Ends tonight at midnight.

[00:47:53.105 --> 00:47:54.066]  DNA Force Plus.
[00:47:54.066 --> 00:47:55.467]  I think that's already ended.
[00:47:55.467 --> 00:47:57.249]  Down and Out Liquid Sleep Formula, 50% off.

[00:48:14.069 --> 00:48:17.032]  Covered Land, you get, that sale will continue.
[00:48:17.032 --> 00:48:18.673]  Now you get Covered Land II, the mask.
[00:48:18.673 --> 00:48:20.715]  Very powerful and activist film.
[00:48:20.715 --> 00:48:21.736]  We want you to get it and make copies.
[00:48:22.984 --> 00:48:26.165]  You get two of my films for free with that on one DVD.
[00:48:26.165 --> 00:48:29.826]  So two DVDs for the price of one, three films for the price of one.
[00:48:29.826 --> 00:48:36.108]  Get Order of Death and Dark Secrets of the Sabohemian Grove to have in your archives to share and copy and give to others.
[00:48:36.108 --> 00:48:42.270]  But the free shipping will end tomorrow on that DVD triple deal.
[00:48:42.270 --> 00:48:43.030]  And so much more.
[00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:44.350]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:48:44.350 --> 00:48:44.810]  And the sale
[00:48:51.599 --> 00:48:56.207]  On apparel at cost will go away as well.
[00:49:04.790 --> 00:49:06.791]  Thousands of shirts a week now.
[00:49:06.791 --> 00:49:07.891]  In fact, sometimes a day.
[00:49:07.891 --> 00:49:10.531]  But I'm like, we're literally not making any money.
[00:49:10.531 --> 00:49:11.532]  And I'm not bitching.
[00:49:11.532 --> 00:49:12.852]  It's great to have the shirts going out.
[00:49:12.852 --> 00:49:13.932]  It's great to have them.
[00:49:13.932 --> 00:49:16.473]  But whatever the shirt costs, that's what we're selling it at.
[00:49:16.473 --> 00:49:18.974]  And it's not going to let us continue to operate.
[00:49:18.974 --> 00:49:21.494]  Though there will be a lot of InfoWars t-shirts out there.
[00:49:21.494 --> 00:49:24.435]  So that sale of all the apparel at cost ends today.
[00:49:26.198 --> 00:49:31.300]  Because it's great to have a bunch of money coming in, but not if you don't have extra to pay the bills.
[00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:32.041]  Not bitching.
[00:49:32.041 --> 00:49:33.521]  I'm just telling you where we're at.
[00:49:33.521 --> 00:49:35.102]  Everybody knows how it is with money.
[00:49:35.102 --> 00:49:36.623]  Especially with all this inflation.
[00:49:36.623 --> 00:49:37.943]  Okay.
[00:49:37.943 --> 00:49:39.864]  Let me just sit back for a minute.
[00:49:39.864 --> 00:49:41.665]  Take a calm moment here.
[00:49:41.665 --> 00:49:43.686]  Just settle down, Jones.
[00:49:43.686 --> 00:49:46.027]  Cover the news.
[00:49:46.027 --> 00:49:47.387]  Relax.
[00:49:47.387 --> 00:49:51.169]  Let's just cover the big issue.
[00:49:51.169 --> 00:49:53.150]  If you watch globalists lie to you,
[00:49:54.133 --> 00:49:57.474]  And you don't know why they're doing it, they win.
[00:49:57.474 --> 00:49:59.315]  You're like, what does that mean?
[00:49:59.315 --> 00:50:03.517]  Let me explain it.
[00:50:03.517 --> 00:50:13.942]  If you just know they're lying to you, it makes the last thought you had, they're lying to me, and so there's no exchange going on of ideas.
[00:50:13.942 --> 00:50:17.063]  One of the most successful hack attack systems that they use against
[00:50:18.851 --> 00:50:24.192]  Folks, websites and online operations is what they call a slow loris attack.
[00:50:24.192 --> 00:50:28.113]  I'm not a computer hacker, but I've read about it and been told about it and been the victim of it.
[00:50:28.113 --> 00:50:38.256]  And it's where they hit your computer with a bunch of requests, but they only ask your computer to open up a communication.
[00:50:38.256 --> 00:50:39.856]  You understand?
[00:50:39.856 --> 00:50:42.257]  It's not even trying to get anything into your computer.
[00:50:42.257 --> 00:50:44.117]  It's just trying to have your computer do a handshake.
[00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:52.724]  And so it's that old thing of, hey, shake my hand, and when you try to shake it, you comb your hair.
[00:50:52.724 --> 00:50:54.185]  That's what the left does.
[00:50:54.185 --> 00:50:56.066]  They know we know they're liars.
[00:50:56.066 --> 00:50:57.607]  They know we hate them.
[00:50:57.607 --> 00:51:04.571]  All they can do is, like Loki, run around and stir up problems and set people up and run scams.
[00:51:04.571 --> 00:51:06.632]  That's all they can do.
[00:51:06.632 --> 00:51:07.493]  And that's what they do.
[00:51:07.493 --> 00:51:14.777]  So we know Anderson Cooper went on TV almost a year ago and said we should just take people's Social Security away.
[00:51:15.399 --> 00:51:18.382]  I mean, he said that, I'll play the clip.
[00:51:18.382 --> 00:51:27.831]  But now that's gone viral again, so Reuters, run by Pfizer publicly, look it up.
[00:51:27.831 --> 00:51:36.178]  The CEO of Pfizer is, or the CEO of Reuters is on the board of Pfizer.
[00:51:36.178 --> 00:51:39.041]  They come out with others and say, it's just not true, it's a fake clip.
[00:51:40.347 --> 00:51:44.810]  Now, notice how the discussion becomes, is it real or is it fake?
[00:51:44.810 --> 00:51:56.658]  Instead of you going, oh, you lied to me, let's get back to the fact that you want a global social credit score, you want to take our social security, that's what the COVID's about, is killing you so you don't get the social security.
[00:51:56.658 --> 00:52:03.443]  It's all about that, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:03.443 --> 00:52:07.806]  So see, you have to, every time they attack you, it's not enough to just know they're lying.
[00:52:09.215 --> 00:52:11.456]  They know you know they're lying.
[00:52:11.456 --> 00:52:13.617]  How did they just change your view?
[00:52:13.617 --> 00:52:23.523]  How did they just distract you from where you were saying, I don't want my social security being taken because I don't take your poison shot that's designed to kill me anyways, so I don't get my social security I paid for.
[00:52:26.795 --> 00:52:27.715]  See?
[00:52:27.715 --> 00:52:28.895]  And I know that's really simple.
[00:52:28.895 --> 00:52:33.776]  Once I say it, you're like, yeah, but that's what they do constantly in every way.
[00:52:33.776 --> 00:52:50.479]  And then they introduce ridiculous, preposterous things to you like, a biological male can win the boxing matches and the weightlifting matches and the wrestling matches and the swimming matches and the running matches and the pole vaulting matches and the... It's ridiculous!
[00:52:50.479 --> 00:52:52.260]  It's absolutely... But see,
[00:52:53.803 --> 00:52:57.207]  People go, man, these crazy liberals tell us a man can have a baby.
[00:52:57.207 --> 00:52:58.228]  They're not crazy.
[00:52:58.228 --> 00:53:05.717]  They're injecting a psychological virus into you, where your brain, when it sees this type of craziness everywhere, gives up.
[00:53:05.717 --> 00:53:07.559]  Unless you're aware of the trick.
[00:53:08.388 --> 00:53:15.232]  And then you become more resistant, more aware when they attack you, and then you start becoming like me.
[00:53:15.232 --> 00:53:27.158]  And I'm certainly not perfect, but I learned what they were doing decades ago at a subconscious level, consciously in the last decade, and I began to learn to be constantly aware of the full depth of what they're doing.
[00:53:28.641 --> 00:53:31.063]  And then you see the code of the matrix.
[00:53:31.063 --> 00:53:37.607]  And then it doesn't have power over you anymore because you understand the emotional control grid system that I write about and I talk about.
[00:53:37.607 --> 00:53:40.208]  I want to show you this right now, actually.
[00:53:40.208 --> 00:53:44.051]  And then we'll cover the Bill Gates thing next hour and get into all of it.
[00:53:44.051 --> 00:53:45.351]  I want to show you this right now.
[00:53:45.351 --> 00:53:51.015]  Such incredible reviews coming in.
[00:53:51.015 --> 00:53:52.896]  Thousands of written reviews.
[00:53:52.896 --> 00:53:53.997]  Hundreds of video reviews.
[00:53:53.997 --> 00:53:57.399]  We've got a team of people trying to go through them and get them ready to show the next few weeks.
[00:53:58.396 --> 00:54:10.803]  And they're like 98% positive, but one person put this together and even made a graph and sent it out and showed up on the internet, because I'm not, it's here, it's not me.
[00:54:10.803 --> 00:54:12.964]  I just use InfoWars as their logo.
[00:54:12.964 --> 00:54:16.506]  And I actually totally agree with the review of their chapters.
[00:54:16.506 --> 00:54:17.927]  Terrible review of Chapter 1 and 2.
[00:54:20.711 --> 00:54:32.014]  50-50 review of chapters 3 and 4, a 100% rating for 5, a 90% rating for 6, a 100% rating for 7, a 90% rating for 8, a 100% rating for 9 and 10.
[00:54:32.014 --> 00:54:34.374]  Absolutely dead accurate.
[00:54:34.374 --> 00:54:35.715]  That is how I would rate it myself.
[00:54:35.715 --> 00:54:38.935]  But you've got to understand, this is for everybody.
[00:54:38.935 --> 00:54:40.095]  And so what do they say in the review?
[00:54:40.095 --> 00:54:44.056]  Ah, I already knew everything in the first four chapters.
[00:54:44.056 --> 00:54:46.537]  Yeah, but see, imagine if we had put this out
[00:54:49.983 --> 00:54:51.884]  And then not put all this in.
[00:54:51.884 --> 00:54:55.486]  This is a bridge for people that aren't as informed as you to get it.
[00:54:55.486 --> 00:55:00.249]  But, in fact, I almost said that in a review, in my own review, and I said, nah, don't bash your own course.
[00:55:00.249 --> 00:55:04.992]  I wanted to say, hey, for a lot of you, you might just skip the first three, four chapters.
[00:55:04.992 --> 00:55:06.873]  Because you're going to know all this.
[00:55:06.873 --> 00:55:12.196]  But you've got to, to get on the cruise ship, you've got to walk across the gangway, you know?
[00:55:12.196 --> 00:55:15.318]  I mean, to get on the airplane, you've got to go down the hallway.
[00:55:15.318 --> 00:55:19.100]  I mean, we can't put something out that doesn't have the training wheels.
[00:55:20.629 --> 00:55:21.970]  Like, you might go buy your kid a bike.
[00:55:21.970 --> 00:55:27.094]  I was using the bike analogy earlier, and it's, you know, your kid's seven years old, and it's a bigger bike, but it's got training wheels.
[00:55:27.094 --> 00:55:28.294]  Well, you're going to take them off.
[00:55:28.294 --> 00:55:35.199]  That's a bigger bike for a kid that learned how to ride later, and so you still buy the bike, even though it's got training wheels, you just take them off.
[00:55:35.199 --> 00:55:43.465]  So, yes, the course has training wheels on it, and that's for people that go and get it and don't know.
[00:55:43.465 --> 00:55:47.328]  So, very good listeners, you figured it out that it's got training wheels on it.
[00:55:48.831 --> 00:55:50.873]  But doesn't everything that works?
[00:55:50.873 --> 00:55:54.596]  I mean, you know, you might go buy a rifle, a bolt-action rifle, and you've been using one for 50 years.
[00:55:54.596 --> 00:55:58.379]  You know how to use a bolt-action rifle, and you don't need an owner's manual.
[00:55:58.379 --> 00:56:03.404]  The owner's manual is in there for somebody that never went and got a bolt-action rifle.
[00:56:03.404 --> 00:56:05.246]  And that's what this is.
[00:56:05.246 --> 00:56:08.568]  Is, is, is the owner's manual.
[00:56:10.225 --> 00:56:15.870]  Chapter 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are the keys to bringing down the New World Order.
[00:56:15.870 --> 00:56:23.055]  And what they don't want you to know, ResetWars.com, and we're still offering 25% off at ResetWars.com.
[00:56:23.055 --> 00:56:29.300]  But I love that detailed review that a listener put together.
[00:56:29.300 --> 00:56:30.121]  I guess it's here, 48153235.
[00:56:36.138 --> 00:56:39.220]  And it says, Rating Reset Wars by Chapter.
[00:56:39.220 --> 00:56:46.644]  I have been watching since 2015, so I already knew most of the stuff he talks about in Chapter 1 to 4.
[00:56:46.644 --> 00:56:50.446]  That's the type of review I like, because it's real.
[00:56:50.446 --> 00:56:56.690]  That is a dead-on review, and that is my own personal criticism, but we still did the training wheels.
[00:56:57.659 --> 00:57:09.849]  And again, that's so when you share the course with friends and family, you don't have, because let me tell you, you think you know all this, I think I know it all, but imagine somebody that has no idea, these training wheels are like mountains to them.
[00:57:09.849 --> 00:57:12.972]  I mean, these training wheels are like really intimidating and wild.
[00:57:14.992 --> 00:57:15.873]  Alright, I'm gonna shut up.
[00:57:15.873 --> 00:57:17.255]  We're gonna go to break.
[00:57:17.255 --> 00:57:19.698]  Come back with a gaslighting of gaslighting.
[00:57:19.698 --> 00:57:21.881]  Anderson Cooper saying, take your Social Security.
[00:57:21.881 --> 00:57:22.742]  Bigger than Dallas.
[00:57:22.742 --> 00:57:25.245]  Bill Gates having an orgasm, it looks like.
[00:57:25.245 --> 00:57:28.409]  And then it's now gone viral again and the media says it's not real!
[00:57:30.542 --> 00:57:41.053]  And then the UN saying global financial collapse, global economic collapse, global collapse is being triggered by the medical collapse that they're using as a smokescreen for their great reset takeover.
[00:57:41.053 --> 00:57:43.236]  Hour number two is straight ahead.
[00:57:43.236 --> 00:57:45.778]  I want to thank you all for keeping us on air.
[00:57:45.778 --> 00:57:46.159]  Stay with us.
[00:57:48.933 --> 00:57:59.523]  Well, if InfoWars was battle-hardened and wounded and punished and tortured and demonized and lied about in the last 20-plus years, we've really gone through...
[00:58:00.632 --> 00:58:02.593]  The most destructive year we've ever seen.
[00:58:02.593 --> 00:58:04.853]  But so is the country, so is the world.
[00:58:04.853 --> 00:58:08.274]  And InfoWars intends to go into the thick of the fight.
[00:58:08.274 --> 00:58:09.775]  We intend to get attacked.
[00:58:09.775 --> 00:58:11.636]  We also intend to win.
[00:58:11.636 --> 00:58:13.916]  But we can't do that without working together.
[00:58:13.916 --> 00:58:18.738]  So I wanted to thank all of you in this insane year of 2021 for your support.
[00:58:19.338 --> 00:58:21.679]  And for your promotion of liberty and freedom.
[00:58:21.679 --> 00:58:26.442]  And I want to encourage you all to understand that we're not backing down, and the Great Awakening is here.
[00:58:26.442 --> 00:58:28.083]  That's why the globalists are so scared.
[00:58:28.083 --> 00:58:31.545]  And I want to encourage you to take advantage of the best deals of the year.
[00:58:31.545 --> 00:58:39.290]  We were going to extend through the 1st, but we're selling out of basically everything, so we have to end the sales Thursday morning.
[00:58:39.290 --> 00:58:41.351]  So I'm cutting this on Tuesday morning.
[00:58:41.351 --> 00:58:47.575]  That means there's just two days left to get store-wide free shipping, double Patriot points, up to 60% off at InfoWareStore.com
[00:58:48.672 --> 00:58:53.518]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalists.
[00:58:53.518 --> 00:58:55.580]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[00:58:55.580 --> 00:59:01.046]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[00:59:01.046 --> 00:59:02.167]  But we failed.
[00:59:02.167 --> 00:59:03.349]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[00:59:03.809 --> 00:59:11.673]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat-footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization Great Reset.
[00:59:11.673 --> 00:59:20.078]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show, because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[00:59:20.598 --> 00:59:25.801]  So we've got to information warfare the enemy and try to stop their agenda, but we've also got to get personally prepared.
[00:59:25.801 --> 00:59:28.683]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storable food.
[00:59:28.683 --> 00:59:33.466]  We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarestore.com.
[00:59:33.466 --> 00:59:39.050]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready to ship right now.
[00:59:39.050 --> 00:59:46.295]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits, because believe me, serious times are coming.
[00:59:46.295 --> 00:59:48.156]  Get ready at infowarestore.com.
[00:59:52.031 --> 00:59:56.054]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:59:56.054 --> 00:59:58.515]  Well, Dr. Robert W. Malone
[01:00:20.310 --> 01:00:21.991]  Has been banned by Twitter.
[01:00:21.991 --> 01:00:25.732]  The inventor of mRNA technology got more and more hardcore.
[01:00:25.732 --> 01:00:30.094]  He came out last week with an emergency message to parents, saying this is not a vaccine.
[01:00:30.094 --> 01:00:32.735]  It is linked to major heart problems and death.
[01:00:32.735 --> 01:00:36.517]  You should not give it to your children, or you should at least research.
[01:00:36.517 --> 01:00:39.478]  Well, now, it has been banned.
[01:00:39.478 --> 01:00:41.959]  Robert W. Malone, M.D.
[01:00:41.959 --> 01:00:42.479]  Suspended.
[01:00:42.479 --> 01:00:43.079]  You're never banned.
[01:00:43.079 --> 01:00:44.700]  They just call it permanently
[01:00:48.575 --> 01:00:48.895]  We're good to go.
[01:01:12.148 --> 01:01:14.349]  Here's a nurse speaking at a city council meeting.
[01:01:14.349 --> 01:01:16.590]  The video's on InfoWars.com.
[01:01:16.590 --> 01:01:19.951]  More children died from the jab than COVID itself.
[01:01:19.951 --> 01:01:21.552]  Dr. Malone exposes that, by the way.
[01:01:21.552 --> 01:01:23.313]  When we come back, I'll show you the actual statistics.
[01:01:23.313 --> 01:01:23.633]  Here it is.
[01:01:24.935 --> 01:01:26.356]  My name is Colette Martin.
[01:01:26.356 --> 01:01:27.137]  I'm an RN.
[01:01:27.137 --> 01:01:30.600]  I have 17 years, 12 years oncology.
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:34.463]  In the past five years, I've been a float resource nurse to all the different floors in the hospital.
[01:01:34.463 --> 01:01:38.966]  I'm extremely concerned with the idea of mandating this vaccine for our children.
[01:01:38.966 --> 01:01:43.570]  The reactions we're seeing in the hospital with adults are terrifying and they're being ignored.
[01:01:43.570 --> 01:01:52.097]  Just some examples of post-vaccine reactions are blood clots, heart attacks, strokes, encephalopathy, heart arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation.
[01:01:52.097 --> 01:01:54.439]  Also in the elderly, we're seeing an increase in falls,
[01:01:55.310 --> 01:01:59.753]  Syncope, acute onset of confusion with unknown ideology.
[01:01:59.753 --> 01:02:06.779]  Also, two young and healthy co-workers I know had vision changes, tingling and numbness to lower extremities they're still dealing with.
[01:02:06.779 --> 01:02:09.000]  Another co-worker developed DVTs.
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:15.085]  I personally had a patient die three months after his vaccines of pericarditis, which we know is a known side effect.
[01:02:15.085 --> 01:02:18.768]  Diagnosed 30 days after his shot, no mention to VAERS.
[01:02:18.768 --> 01:02:22.951]  Majority of our nurses, nurse managers, and some doctors do not even know what VAERS is.
[01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:32.285]  I've spoken to our chief of medicine, managers, other nurses on why we're not reporting to VAERS, and the most common response is, what is VAERS?
[01:02:32.285 --> 01:02:36.047]  It's a topic that's very difficult to address in the hospital setting.
[01:02:36.047 --> 01:02:39.148]  I bring up my concerns and repeatedly get dismissed.
[01:02:39.148 --> 01:02:42.230]  I've been told, I'm sure someone is investigating this.
[01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:43.651]  Well, if we aren't, then who is?
[01:02:44.250 --> 01:02:49.274]  Especially since Pfizer ended their study just six months after the trial started.
[01:02:49.274 --> 01:02:53.337]  I also have been told that VAERS isn't the best indication of vaccine side effects.
[01:02:53.337 --> 01:02:56.460]  Well, if that's the case, what are we supposed to be looking at?
[01:02:56.460 --> 01:03:03.826]  Over 18,000 deaths, a million permanently disabled, and the CDC admits only 1-10% of reactions are even being reported.
[01:03:03.826 --> 01:03:06.888]  And we know the hospitals are not reporting anything.
[01:03:06.888 --> 01:03:08.729]  This is not just where I work.
[01:03:08.729 --> 01:03:13.133]  I have many nurse friends in other local hospitals in the Southeast Louisiana say the same thing.
[01:03:13.795 --> 01:03:17.498]  What I also find is highly disturbing is our treatment protocol.
[01:03:17.498 --> 01:03:20.840]  I truly believe our protocol is killing our COVID patients.
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:23.803]  When I ask other nurses their thoughts, they agree.
[01:03:23.803 --> 01:03:27.325]  At this point, doctors will admit our main treatment is not working.
[01:03:27.325 --> 01:03:28.726]  But it's all we have.
[01:03:28.726 --> 01:03:30.368]  We know that's simply not true.
[01:03:30.368 --> 01:03:32.549]  It's just what the CDC will allow us to give.
[01:03:32.549 --> 01:03:34.251]  Our hands are tied.
[01:03:34.251 --> 01:03:35.952]  Back to our children, though.
[01:03:35.952 --> 01:03:42.357]  We have chemotherapies that we know have side effects causing blood cancer such as leukemia in 10 plus years after giving the drug.
[01:03:42.924 --> 01:03:46.908]  We know this because we have real long-term trials on these drugs.
[01:03:46.908 --> 01:03:53.053]  We are not just seeing severe acute reactions with this vaccine, but we have zero idea what any long-term reactions are.
[01:03:53.053 --> 01:03:56.016]  Cancers, autoimmune, infertility, we just don't know.
[01:03:56.016 --> 01:04:01.841]  We are potentially sacrificing our children for fear of maybe dying getting sick of a virus.
[01:04:01.841 --> 01:04:03.022]  A virus with a 99% survival rate.
[01:04:04.623 --> 01:04:06.964]  Our children are not even at risk for this.
[01:04:06.964 --> 01:04:11.727]  As of now we have more children that's died from the COVID vaccine than of COVID itself.
[01:04:11.727 --> 01:04:18.370]  And then the health department to come out and say the new variant has all the side effects of the vaccine reactions we're currently seeing now.
[01:04:18.370 --> 01:04:24.774]  It's maddening and I don't understand why more people don't see it and I think they do but fear speaking out and even worse being fired.
[01:04:25.330 --> 01:04:34.715]  They simply... This is not something easy for me to come up here and speak about, but I feel deep conviction about speaking truth and what the nurses are saying behind those hospital walls.
[01:04:34.715 --> 01:04:37.577]  This is not about adults who can choose to research or not.
[01:04:37.577 --> 01:04:39.158]  This is about our helpless children.
[01:04:39.158 --> 01:04:46.922]  And when I look back on this in 20 to 30 years, I have to know that I did everything I could, and I'm asking you to please ponder this.
[01:04:46.922 --> 01:04:49.284]  What side of history will you be on?
[01:04:49.284 --> 01:04:51.245]  I have to know this madness has to stop.
[01:04:52.119 --> 01:04:54.730]  Colette Martin, a true hero, a true patriot.
[01:04:54.730 --> 01:04:55.935]  Can't wait to get her on the show.
[01:04:55.935 --> 01:04:56.377]  Stay with us.
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:02.141]  2021 has been an incredible year.
[01:05:02.141 --> 01:05:07.142]  It's been an incredible year for evil, but it's also been an amazing year for the global awakening.
[01:05:07.142 --> 01:05:09.162]  It's hard to believe it's almost over.
[01:05:09.162 --> 01:05:18.284]  Christmas 2021 is now a thing of history, and we are plunging into the most critical year, not just in US history, but world history, in my view.
[01:05:18.284 --> 01:05:21.085]  So please continue to spread the word about InfoWars.
[01:05:21.085 --> 01:05:22.585]  Please continue to pray for the broadcast.
[01:05:22.905 --> 01:05:27.088]  Because all of us together, including you the viewers and listeners, are the tip of the spear.
[01:05:27.088 --> 01:05:32.532]  And take advantage of Christmas sales that will end Thursday morning.
[01:05:32.532 --> 01:05:35.354]  I'm cutting this on Tuesday morning.
[01:05:35.354 --> 01:05:38.637]  It's only going to run until Thursday morning and the sale will end.
[01:05:38.637 --> 01:05:40.138]  Up to 60% off.
[01:05:40.138 --> 01:05:41.039]  Double patriot points.
[01:05:41.539 --> 01:05:42.299]  We're good to go.
[01:06:09.557 --> 01:06:14.359]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:06:14.359 --> 01:06:16.079]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:06:16.079 --> 01:06:17.740]  Well, so does he.
[01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:23.201]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:23.201 --> 01:06:37.746]  Here we are in the last moments of the insane year 2021 plunging together into the year 2022 and the New World Order onslaught that we now see expanding against us.
[01:06:39.534 --> 01:06:43.057]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:06:43.057 --> 01:06:49.301]  We have an investigative journalist joining us in the next hour, 55 minutes from now.
[01:06:49.301 --> 01:06:58.488]  Pathology results showed 93% of people who died after being vaccinated were killed by the vaccine.
[01:06:58.488 --> 01:07:02.331]  That's mainline studies coming up.
[01:07:04.770 --> 01:07:06.350]  Then we've got all these headlines.
[01:07:06.350 --> 01:07:15.532]  Lockdown policies and mask mandates link with lower IQs in children.
[01:07:15.532 --> 01:07:25.834]  Shock video NYPD vax passport enforces breakup child's birthday party.
[01:07:25.834 --> 01:07:26.954]  Judge rules on U.S.
[01:07:26.954 --> 01:07:32.195]  military vax mandates lawsuit and Oklahoma throws it out.
[01:07:32.195 --> 01:07:33.315]  Engages in true tyranny.
[01:07:34.505 --> 01:07:38.967]  I think preludes and foreshadowing of what's about to happen with the Supreme Court.
[01:07:38.967 --> 01:07:42.788]  This is a criminal takeover.
[01:07:42.788 --> 01:07:56.913]  And a lot of people look at this and they go, how are they going to get away with four or five soccer players a week dying and with all these Hollywood people dying and all these famous people having heart attacks and dying and neighbors knowing?
[01:07:56.913 --> 01:07:59.214]  And the answer is, by killing you.
[01:08:00.854 --> 01:08:05.818]  If they've gotten about 50% of Americans to take the shot.
[01:08:05.818 --> 01:08:07.199]  I told you that a year ago.
[01:08:07.199 --> 01:08:08.921]  I said, I think they're going to exaggerate the numbers.
[01:08:08.921 --> 01:08:10.622]  And they did.
[01:08:10.622 --> 01:08:11.943]  They now admit it is at 79%.
[01:08:11.943 --> 01:08:15.346]  It's more like 50%.
[01:08:15.346 --> 01:08:16.387]  And that's why they're so pissed.
[01:08:16.387 --> 01:08:23.472]  Because this has become very obvious when those people are sick, dead, and dying, that it was the shots.
[01:08:23.472 --> 01:08:25.654]  And that's why they're failing.
[01:08:25.654 --> 01:08:28.276]  Places like Israel, where they've gotten 90%.
[01:08:28.276 --> 01:08:29.617]  Places like the UK, where they've gotten 90%.
[01:08:31.291 --> 01:08:36.275]  Places like Germany, man, it's gonna be really, really rough, folks.
[01:08:36.275 --> 01:08:47.123]  And now they just gotta round up whoever's left, because the insiders, the party members of the New World Order, the eugenicists, they're not taking any of these shots.
[01:08:47.123 --> 01:08:48.564]  They are depopulating you.
[01:08:48.564 --> 01:08:49.585]  They are getting rid of you.
[01:08:49.585 --> 01:08:51.066]  They are saving the Earth.
[01:08:51.066 --> 01:08:54.328]  They believe that this is a good thing they're doing.
[01:08:54.328 --> 01:08:58.992]  And they know, they're betting on, they're hoping, they're crossing their little fingers,
[01:09:00.925 --> 01:09:07.951]  That you can't admit the horror of what's happening to you.
[01:09:07.951 --> 01:09:15.357]  And so you're just going to continue to go along with it, because here's the bad part for all of us.
[01:09:15.357 --> 01:09:27.228]  Even if you're awake, like I am, or like so many of us are, you don't just think a sophisticated attack like this is only on those they're going to inject.
[01:09:27.228 --> 01:09:27.548]  No, sir.
[01:09:31.107 --> 01:09:39.052]  The lockdowns have already killed, they haven't given out numbers in six sub-months, 25 million extra people last year starved to death.
[01:09:39.052 --> 01:09:45.037]  No new numbers have come out since February or March of this year.
[01:09:45.037 --> 01:09:58.526]  An extra 280 plus million the UN says are on the verge of starving from the lockdowns that are now back in place in Africa and many areas of Latin America because the IMF and World Bank, the private banks, they control those leaders through debt.
[01:10:00.293 --> 01:10:03.416]  So they order them to keep people at home and make them starve to death.
[01:10:03.416 --> 01:10:10.181]  And people are very stoic in the third world.
[01:10:10.181 --> 01:10:15.985]  They just shrivel up and starve to death and die.
[01:10:15.985 --> 01:10:17.707]  And they never say they died of starvation.
[01:10:17.707 --> 01:10:19.728]  It's always, oh, they died of the cold.
[01:10:19.728 --> 01:10:23.672]  They died of the flu.
[01:10:23.672 --> 01:10:26.554]  And so here we are watching this, and then
[01:10:29.190 --> 01:10:42.741]  Almost a year ago, I mean it was a long time ago, Bill Gates went on Anderson Cooper when the shots were starting in the US and said, shouldn't we just mandate through Social Security?
[01:10:43.726 --> 01:10:46.367]  Take the Social Security away if you don't do it.
[01:10:46.367 --> 01:10:52.768]  And Bill Gates was smiling and laughing and nodding his head, always getting excited about inappropriate things.
[01:10:52.768 --> 01:10:56.429]  Two inbred generational wealth globalists.
[01:10:56.429 --> 01:11:00.370]  Anderson Cooper's mother helped finance Bill Gates' foundation.
[01:11:00.370 --> 01:11:07.912]  She was the second largest financier after the founder of IBM, Thomas Watson.
[01:11:07.912 --> 01:11:11.453]  They're together at the quote billionaire club depopulation meetings.
[01:11:11.453 --> 01:11:11.813]  Look it up.
[01:11:13.379 --> 01:11:17.965]  Jeffrey Epstein, the rest of these guys, like Larry Summers.
[01:11:17.965 --> 01:11:22.972]  And so, there they are.
[01:11:22.972 --> 01:11:31.382]  And so this clip comes back out, people are looking at global social credit scores, they're looking at AI computer systems through the vaccine passport, they're really waking up to what this is.
[01:11:33.823 --> 01:11:41.966]  And so out comes Reuters, and out comes AP, and out comes Mediaite, and out comes all the fact-checkers.
[01:11:41.966 --> 01:11:43.847]  That means corporate lapdogs.
[01:11:43.847 --> 01:11:45.208]  And they go, no, no, no, no.
[01:11:45.208 --> 01:11:46.128]  They never show you the clip.
[01:11:46.128 --> 01:11:48.629]  They just say, he didn't say that.
[01:11:48.629 --> 01:11:51.930]  He didn't say that, OK?
[01:11:51.930 --> 01:11:53.371]  So when they're pushing it, it's good.
[01:11:53.371 --> 01:12:00.954]  But when you go, hey, that's a bad idea, they don't even give you the respect of a debate about their death panels and their eugenics.
[01:12:00.954 --> 01:12:02.434]  They just go, oh, that doesn't exist.
[01:12:02.434 --> 01:12:03.195]  Well, you just said it.
[01:12:03.195 --> 01:12:03.495]  No, it didn't.
[01:12:05.034 --> 01:12:07.356]  And that's the definition of gaslighting.
[01:12:07.356 --> 01:12:12.619]  And imagine being the people that take money to be part of this.
[01:12:12.619 --> 01:12:28.411]  Imagine being the people part of the system at Apple, at Twitter, at Google, that just banned Dr. Robert Malone, M.D., the inventor of mRNA technology, because he put out an emergency warning to parents saying these shots are linked to massive heart problems.
[01:12:28.411 --> 01:12:31.233]  He's not allowed to tell you what's even on the insert.
[01:12:31.233 --> 01:12:32.533]  He's banned.
[01:12:32.533 --> 01:12:34.315]  Well, he now joins the ranks of the humans.
[01:12:36.328 --> 01:12:41.192]  That's not a negative, that's a badge of courage!
[01:12:41.192 --> 01:12:52.863]  Because when you're surfing the apocalypse, when you're entering the end of this old era and the beginning of the new system of Christ, you don't want to be on the side of the devil.
[01:12:52.863 --> 01:12:55.505]  It's going to look like to the very last minute they're winning.
[01:12:55.505 --> 01:12:56.386]  They're losers!
[01:12:59.116 --> 01:13:00.617]  So there's a 10-second clip.
[01:13:00.617 --> 01:13:02.138]  Let's play the short one first going around.
[01:13:02.138 --> 01:13:03.879]  They say, oh, it's out of context.
[01:13:03.879 --> 01:13:04.219]  It's not real.
[01:13:04.219 --> 01:13:06.680]  Then we're going to play the full clip afterwards.
[01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:10.222]  But here they are when the shot started earlier this year.
[01:13:10.222 --> 01:13:12.303]  This is February.
[01:13:12.303 --> 01:13:14.245]  Telling you that they want to make you take it.
[01:13:14.245 --> 01:13:18.167]  Hell, you've seen Kathleen Sebelius say, don't let you leave your house or have a job.
[01:13:18.167 --> 01:13:25.571]  You've seen the Democrats say, you've seen them all over the country say, you can't have a job or get on a train or a bus or you can't go into a restaurant.
[01:13:25.571 --> 01:13:26.892]  You can't go into a YMCA.
[01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:31.302]  You can't go into a coffee shop.
[01:13:31.302 --> 01:13:32.743]  Oh, but nobody's suppressing you.
[01:13:32.743 --> 01:13:33.804]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:13:33.804 --> 01:13:38.148]  Anderson Cooper and Bill Gates don't want to don't want to take your social security.
[01:13:38.148 --> 01:13:42.011]  They just want to kill you with a shot so you don't get your social security.
[01:13:42.011 --> 01:13:44.113]  Here's the short clip.
[01:13:44.113 --> 01:13:45.754]  Social security.
[01:13:45.754 --> 01:13:52.300]  You need to be vaccinated if you want to get whatever whatever benefits they give.
[01:13:52.300 --> 01:13:53.921]  You need to be vaccinated.
[01:13:53.921 --> 01:13:55.242]  OK, so there's the shorter clip.
[01:13:55.242 --> 01:13:55.943]  Here's the full clip.
[01:13:57.370 --> 01:14:02.614]  Obviously corporations increasingly are saying you have to be vaccinated in order to work at our corporation.
[01:14:02.614 --> 01:14:14.242]  Is that something you support and do you think the federal government or state governments or the very least federal government should mandate if you want to get on an airplane you have to be vaccinated if you want to get
[01:14:15.596 --> 01:14:25.203]  Social Security, you need to be vaccinated if you want to get whatever benefits they give, you need to be vaccinated for.
[01:14:25.203 --> 01:14:26.624]  Is that something that the U.S.
[01:14:26.624 --> 01:14:28.765]  can and should do?
[01:14:28.765 --> 01:14:42.114]  Well, certainly if you take a case like nursing homes, where we are seeing transmission primarily through unvaccinated people, there you can make a very compelling case.
[01:14:44.524 --> 01:14:54.849]  Once you get far beyond that, the question is, will it work to get people to seek out the vaccine?
[01:14:54.849 --> 01:15:02.233]  One elderly care home said, hey, if I require it, but the others don't, I simply just have less workers.
[01:15:02.233 --> 01:15:06.675]  And so you have to step back and think through this whole system.
[01:15:06.675 --> 01:15:10.677]  But I would hope that we can get to 80%.
[01:15:10.677 --> 01:15:11.597]  I would hope we can get to 90%.
[01:15:13.325 --> 01:15:17.386]  You know, today, we were stalled out for a little bit.
[01:15:17.386 --> 01:15:24.789]  Now, a tiny bit of acceleration, as people realize, they'll just change the rules.
[01:15:24.789 --> 01:15:30.731]  Okay, and you know, I'm glad that the crew found a whole nother clip, because I'm sorry, they've said this three times.
[01:15:30.731 --> 01:15:32.612]  He said it in February.
[01:15:32.612 --> 01:15:33.092]  He said it in
[01:15:34.790 --> 01:15:37.871]  August, and then now I guess that's a newer eclipse.
[01:15:37.871 --> 01:15:39.552]  We're going to get to the bottom of this.
[01:15:39.552 --> 01:15:41.633]  The point is, they're saying this a lot.
[01:15:41.633 --> 01:15:49.516]  I mean, we've all seen them on the news saying you need to take a shot to be able to have a job or travel, but now they're saying, I've got the headlines right here, that it's not happening.
[01:15:49.516 --> 01:15:54.698]  No, Anderson Cooper did not say unvaccinated Americans should be denied Social Security.
[01:15:54.698 --> 01:15:55.098]  Oh really?
[01:15:55.098 --> 01:15:55.698]  We just played it.
[01:15:58.286 --> 01:16:03.807]  I'm cutting this announcement on the morning of December 28th, 2021.
[01:16:03.807 --> 01:16:14.010]  And that means you've only got until Thursday morning, or less than two days, to take advantage of the biggest sales of 2021.
[01:16:14.010 --> 01:16:21.031]  Up to 60% off on our best-selling products, double Patriot Points, and store-wide free shipping.
[01:16:21.031 --> 01:16:24.752]  DNA Force Plus is about to go off sale.
[01:16:24.752 --> 01:16:27.173]  VitaMineral Fusion is about to go off sale.
[01:16:27.992 --> 01:16:32.155]  Ultimate Bone Broth that we finally got reformulated and back in stock.
[01:16:32.155 --> 01:16:39.701]  It is going to be ending its sale along with more than 50 other products at InfoWarsTore.com and the free shipping.
[01:16:39.701 --> 01:16:46.366]  So you've got until Thursday to get the best deals of 2021 and they're gone, they're over.
[01:16:46.366 --> 01:16:50.470]  We were going to run them through to the new year, but most of these products have almost sold out.
[01:16:50.470 --> 01:16:51.630]  A lot have already sold out.
[01:16:51.630 --> 01:16:52.831]  So thanks for keeping us on the air.
[01:16:52.831 --> 01:16:53.872]  These are great products.
[01:16:53.872 --> 01:16:54.793]  It's a win-win.
[01:16:54.793 --> 01:16:55.914]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:16:57.978 --> 01:17:01.700]  Everything I do is about victory for humanity.
[01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:07.563]  Everything I promote is about standing up against the new world order by empowering humanity.
[01:17:07.563 --> 01:17:09.764]  Well, that's why ResetWars.com is so important.
[01:17:09.764 --> 01:17:24.292]  Not only is it a game-changing course of critical information to unlock your mind from the matrix, but it's something that gets around Klaus Schwab's attempt to shut down American infrastructure and American jobs.
[01:17:25.012 --> 01:17:27.237]  It is the true digital economy.
[01:17:27.237 --> 01:17:31.385]  It's the spiritual economy of the mind and transcendental control.
[01:17:32.383 --> 01:17:40.447]  I've been on there 28 years, and all of our work has been amazing, thanks to God and God's divine empowerment and blessing.
[01:17:40.447 --> 01:17:46.391]  But I got to tell you, out of everything I've done, Reset Wars is the most important, and it is now available.
[01:17:46.391 --> 01:17:51.113]  Now, the month of December 2021 is here at ResetWars.com.
[01:17:51.113 --> 01:17:55.216]  Start your journey to the next level today at ResetWars.com.
[01:17:55.216 --> 01:17:57.497]  The globalists fear this information.
[01:17:57.975 --> 01:18:07.757]  Since the end of World War II, the globalists have been building their private corporate world government, whose endgame, once they get control, is forced depopulation of the planet.
[01:18:07.757 --> 01:18:18.520]  That's why as we begin to leave the year 2021 and go into 2022, I am encouraging all of you out there watching and listening to count the cost and to realize how much danger you and your family are in.
[01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:20.260]  The globalists are coming after everybody.
[01:18:20.620 --> 01:18:25.386]  They are setting up a dystopic, planetary, authoritarian technocracy.
[01:18:25.386 --> 01:18:27.850]  A dictatorship of the globalists.
[01:18:27.850 --> 01:18:30.293]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[01:18:30.293 --> 01:18:35.299]  Your investment in us over the years, buying our products, spreading the word, and praying for us has been incredible.
[01:18:35.299 --> 01:18:36.341]  But I'm telling you right now,
[01:18:36.641 --> 01:18:40.866]  We're about to lose not just Infowars, but the entire country and the world to tyranny.
[01:18:40.866 --> 01:18:44.470]  So now, everything you've done in the past needs to be redoubled today.
[01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:50.156]  And InfowarsStore.com is one of the most important places you can go to buy great products and fund the tip of the spear.
[01:18:50.156 --> 01:18:51.317]  I will go down with the ship.
[01:18:51.317 --> 01:18:52.338]  I'm not going to back down.
[01:18:52.338 --> 01:18:54.060]  I'm getting even more hardcore in their face.
[01:18:54.060 --> 01:18:56.542]  But I can't stay in the fight at 100% unless you support us.
[01:18:56.542 --> 01:18:57.564]  So please go to InfowarsStore.com.
[01:18:58.308 --> 01:18:59.609]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:18:59.609 --> 01:19:01.651]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[01:19:01.651 --> 01:19:02.051]  Welcome.
[01:19:02.051 --> 01:19:02.772]  Hello, Alex?
[01:19:02.772 --> 01:19:03.392]  Yes, Malcolm.
[01:19:03.392 --> 01:19:07.656]  Alright, I'm gonna make this quick and real short, where the other Patriots can get on the line.
[01:19:07.656 --> 01:19:12.239]  Uh, Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schroyer.
[01:19:12.239 --> 01:19:15.242]  Super male vitality and brain force plus.
[01:19:15.242 --> 01:19:17.884]  Mix those two together, you're an unstoppable tank.
[01:19:18.124 --> 01:19:19.925]  Supramel Vitality really, really works.
[01:19:19.925 --> 01:19:24.828]  It's cold-pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up.
[01:19:24.828 --> 01:19:31.593]  And so, it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well, but just aren't as strong.
[01:19:31.593 --> 01:19:33.874]  This is like a very fine wine.
[01:19:33.874 --> 01:19:35.575]  In fact, each batch is different.
[01:19:35.575 --> 01:19:38.037]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[01:19:38.037 --> 01:19:41.299]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong?
[01:19:41.299 --> 01:19:42.239]  That's just how it is.
[01:19:42.239 --> 01:19:42.880]  It's how it works.
[01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:47.602]  Uh, so, it's always good, it's just sometimes it's like, super strong.
[01:19:47.602 --> 01:20:00.449]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[01:20:00.449 --> 01:20:06.352]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:11.611 --> 01:20:29.237]  If you want to see a picture that tells a billion words, and you're a TV viewer, you can see this right now.
[01:20:29.237 --> 01:20:35.539]  Vacationing Biden is considering COVID vaccine mandate for domestic travel.
[01:20:38.188 --> 01:20:45.110]  That's the goal of this whole thing is a vaccine passport, carbon tax, social credit score.
[01:20:45.110 --> 01:20:52.892]  And there he is vacationing in his native state.
[01:20:52.892 --> 01:20:58.534]  And he and his wife with the dog wearing mask alone on the beach.
[01:20:58.534 --> 01:21:01.114]  Totally to create fear.
[01:21:01.114 --> 01:21:02.715]  Totally to create hysteria.
[01:21:05.598 --> 01:21:23.782]  Absolutely there to make you think that things are so dangerous, the President of the United States can't go out on his private beachfront property with his new German Shepherd puppy, they killed the last one, and breathe the air.
[01:21:23.782 --> 01:21:34.424]  I mean, anybody should look at that and feel chomped, but, oh no, the average leftist goes, oh, my leader is at the beach by himself with his wife, we better wear a mask.
[01:21:36.687 --> 01:21:41.229]  And that's the sick joke on everybody.
[01:21:41.229 --> 01:21:48.953]  But isn't it a sick joke to have Reuters and AP and all of them say, oh no!
[01:21:48.953 --> 01:21:53.196]  Anderson Cooper never said we should withhold people's Social Security if they don't have the shot.
[01:21:53.196 --> 01:21:55.297]  No, they're just doing it now in Europe.
[01:21:55.297 --> 01:21:57.398]  They're just doing it in Australia.
[01:21:57.398 --> 01:21:59.079]  They're just doing it everywhere.
[01:21:59.079 --> 01:22:01.100]  He just said it!
[01:22:01.100 --> 01:22:04.842]  But, oh, they said it doesn't exist.
[01:22:11.118 --> 01:22:23.663]  But there's Joe, with his wife, at the beach in Delaware, wearing a mask by himself on the private beach.
[01:22:23.663 --> 01:22:32.287]  Remember, if you take the shot, you're totally protected too, but that's why you gotta have new ones, because you're not protected.
[01:22:32.287 --> 01:22:33.247]  And now the U.S.
[01:22:33.247 --> 01:22:34.548]  to mandate, you mean the globalists,
[01:22:35.410 --> 01:22:43.758]  For all border crossers in January, not the illegals coming in, not the migrants, but anybody trucking stuff in, vice versa, including U.S.
[01:22:43.758 --> 01:22:47.641]  citizens now, to cross the border, you've got to have a shot.
[01:22:47.641 --> 01:22:56.349]  Ah, see, the illegal aliens don't, but everybody else does, you see.
[01:22:56.349 --> 01:23:00.233]  See how that works?
[01:23:00.233 --> 01:23:01.514]  Let's play a couple more of these clips.
[01:23:02.799 --> 01:23:04.980]  But again, you just saw the clip earlier.
[01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:05.681]  Fact check.
[01:23:05.681 --> 01:23:11.044]  Anderson Cooper did not say the unvaccinated should be denied Social Security benefits in the clip of Bill Gates.
[01:23:11.044 --> 01:23:14.046]  And they go on to say, well, he said it, but he didn't mean it.
[01:23:14.046 --> 01:23:16.348]  OK, I understand.
[01:23:16.348 --> 01:23:18.870]  Here's another one.
[01:23:18.870 --> 01:23:20.210]  Here's Fauci.
[01:23:20.210 --> 01:23:22.912]  There's a couple of these clips.
[01:23:22.912 --> 01:23:23.713]  But here's Fauci.
[01:23:27.318 --> 01:23:32.821]  Talking about how the vaccine might actually make what you're trying to cure worse.
[01:23:32.821 --> 01:23:36.722]  Then we have another clip of him talking about ADE.
[01:23:36.722 --> 01:23:38.663]  But again, this is from a year ago.
[01:23:38.663 --> 01:23:39.524]  Why would he do this?
[01:23:39.524 --> 01:23:44.666]  Because when it comes out later, he wants to say, oh, see, I told you we'd get rid of your immune system.
[01:23:44.666 --> 01:23:46.687]  I told you we'll give you ADE.
[01:23:46.687 --> 01:23:47.547]  I told you.
[01:23:47.547 --> 01:23:48.788]  Here it is.
[01:23:48.788 --> 01:23:53.230]  To a normal volunteer for a phase one trial to see if it's safe.
[01:23:54.181 --> 01:23:56.262]  That's the fastest that's ever been done.
[01:23:56.262 --> 01:23:57.883]  That's the good news.
[01:23:57.883 --> 01:24:07.449]  The challenging news is that even at that rocket speed, it's going to take a few months to show that the initial safety is okay.
[01:24:07.449 --> 01:24:17.576]  Then you go into a Phase 2 trial, which instead of involving 45 people, which we have in the Phase 1 trial, it involves hundreds if not thousands of people.
[01:24:17.576 --> 01:24:22.399]  That will take another six to eight months to even know if it works.
[01:24:23.140 --> 01:24:31.625]  So at the fastest we can go, it's going to take a year to a year and a half to know if we have a vaccine that we can use.
[01:24:31.625 --> 01:24:50.036]  There's another element to safety and that is if you vaccinate someone and they make an antibody response and then they get exposed and infected, does the response that you induce actually enhance the infection and make it worse?
[01:24:50.036 --> 01:24:52.277]  And the only way you'll know that
[01:24:52.950 --> 01:24:53.311]  I think so.
[01:25:14.508 --> 01:25:22.356]  There was the history of the respiratory syncytial virus vaccine in children, which paradoxically made the children worse.
[01:25:22.356 --> 01:25:22.616]  Oh!
[01:25:22.616 --> 01:25:30.283]  One of the HIV vaccines that we tested several years ago actually made individuals more likely to get infected.
[01:25:30.283 --> 01:25:30.464]  Oh!
[01:25:30.464 --> 01:25:33.907]  So you can't just go out there and give it.
[01:25:33.907 --> 01:25:36.850]  Yeah, you can't just, now that, that was in May of last year.
[01:25:38.348 --> 01:25:41.970]  But now Dr. Robert Malone, the inventor of mRNA, came out and warned of this.
[01:25:41.970 --> 01:25:43.431]  He's now been banned from Twitter.
[01:25:43.431 --> 01:25:46.012]  That article just went live on InfoWars.com.
[01:25:46.012 --> 01:25:52.896]  Robert Malone, inventor of mRNA tech, vaccine tech, banned by Twitter for exposing risk of COVID-19 vaccines.
[01:25:52.896 --> 01:26:00.340]  And we have Christy Lee's two big interviews with him recently that are so important posted in the article.
[01:26:00.340 --> 01:26:01.381]  This is life-saving.
[01:26:01.381 --> 01:26:01.961]  Help get it out.
[01:26:03.846 --> 01:26:07.467]  And by the way, Malone, we now know, got banned for saying A.D.E.
[01:26:07.467 --> 01:26:13.609]  is happening, what Fauci said a year and a half ago.
[01:26:13.609 --> 01:26:15.129]  Think of the criminal level.
[01:26:15.129 --> 01:26:22.071]  Speaking of A.D.E., here he is with Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, now Metaverse, saying the same thing.
[01:26:22.071 --> 01:26:23.992]  But Fauci's allowed to say it.
[01:26:23.992 --> 01:26:26.152]  You're not.
[01:26:26.152 --> 01:26:31.614]  ...safety study, Mark, is to see if I inject it in the arm,
[01:26:32.307 --> 01:26:37.128]  Does it have some sort of idiosyncratic or bad reaction?
[01:26:37.128 --> 01:26:55.512]  There's another element to safety and that is if you vaccinate someone and they make an antibody response and then they get exposed and infected, does the response that you induce actually enhance the infection and make it worse?
[01:26:55.512 --> 01:26:57.772]  And the only way you'll know that
[01:26:58.448 --> 01:27:09.212]  is if you do an extended study, not in a normal volunteer who has no risk of infection, but in people who are out there in a risk situation.
[01:27:09.212 --> 01:27:19.996]  This would not be the first time, if it happened, that a vaccine that looked good in initial safety, actually made people worse.
[01:27:19.996 --> 01:27:27.339]  There was the history of the respiratory syncytial virus vaccine in children, which paradoxically made the children worse.
[01:27:28.047 --> 01:27:29.850]  We've heard enough.
[01:27:29.850 --> 01:27:31.331]  He just reads the same script everywhere.
[01:27:31.331 --> 01:27:36.398]  So why would he in March, April and May of last year do dozens?
[01:27:36.398 --> 01:27:40.644]  I mean, I've seen at least 15 times he's done the same crap.
[01:27:40.644 --> 01:27:41.845]  Why would he do that?
[01:27:41.845 --> 01:27:43.628]  And then now if you try to say it, you're banned.
[01:27:45.390 --> 01:27:46.650]  They did that for the literature.
[01:27:46.650 --> 01:27:49.311]  Later, when it comes out, they're like, oh, see, we told you.
[01:27:49.311 --> 01:27:55.213]  But you're not supposed to know now, because first, they've got to inject everybody to maim and kill.
[01:27:55.213 --> 01:27:57.414]  They want to be the saviors that expose it.
[01:27:57.414 --> 01:27:58.854]  Later, blame the U.S.
[01:27:58.854 --> 01:28:00.055]  government, bring down the U.S.
[01:28:00.055 --> 01:28:00.975]  government.
[01:28:00.975 --> 01:28:01.575]  The U.N.
[01:28:01.575 --> 01:28:02.756]  is the savior.
[01:28:02.756 --> 01:28:03.696]  Just like the U.N.
[01:28:03.696 --> 01:28:09.278]  comes out and, oh, we've got to shut down the world, and it causes hundreds of millions to be on the verge of starvation.
[01:28:10.018 --> 01:28:15.606]  Tens of millions a quarter starving to death, and then they raise extra money off the people starving to death.
[01:28:15.606 --> 01:28:16.307]  See how that works?
[01:28:17.990 --> 01:28:18.070]  It's
[01:28:47.910 --> 01:28:50.611]  Exactly as I said!
[01:28:50.611 --> 01:28:52.292]  We may not be on air much longer, folks.
[01:28:52.292 --> 01:28:52.933]  Brace yourselves.
[01:29:09.949 --> 01:29:11.910]  The most destructive year we've ever seen.
[01:29:11.910 --> 01:29:14.170]  But so is the country, so is the world.
[01:29:14.170 --> 01:29:17.591]  And InfoWars intends to go into the thick of the fight.
[01:29:17.591 --> 01:29:19.092]  We intend to get attacked.
[01:29:19.092 --> 01:29:20.953]  We also intend to win.
[01:29:20.953 --> 01:29:23.313]  But we can't do that without working together.
[01:29:23.313 --> 01:29:28.075]  So I wanted to thank all of you in this insane year of 2021 for your support.
[01:29:28.655 --> 01:29:30.997]  And for your promotion of liberty and freedom.
[01:29:30.997 --> 01:29:35.760]  And I want to encourage you all to understand that we're not backing down and the Great Awakening is here.
[01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:37.401]  That's why the globalists are so scared.
[01:29:37.401 --> 01:29:48.608]  And I want to encourage you to take advantage of the best deals of the year that we were going to extend through the 1st, but we're selling out of basically everything, so we have to end the sales Thursday morning.
[01:29:48.608 --> 01:29:50.669]  So I'm cutting this on Tuesday morning.
[01:29:50.669 --> 01:29:56.893]  That means there's just two days left to get store-wide free shipping, double Patreon points, up to 60% off at infowarestore.com.
[01:29:58.968 --> 01:30:00.789]  2021 has been an incredible year.
[01:30:00.789 --> 01:30:05.771]  It's been an incredible year for evil, but it's also been an amazing year for the global awakening.
[01:30:05.771 --> 01:30:07.792]  It's hard to believe it's almost over.
[01:30:07.792 --> 01:30:14.456]  Christmas 2021 is now a thing of history, and we are plunging into the most critical year, not just in U.S.
[01:30:14.456 --> 01:30:16.917]  history, but world history, in my view.
[01:30:16.917 --> 01:30:19.739]  So please continue to spread the word about M4 Wars.
[01:30:19.739 --> 01:30:24.001]  Please continue to pray for the broadcast, because all of us together, including you, the viewers and listeners,
[01:30:24.541 --> 01:30:31.164]  Are the tip of the spear and take advantage of Christmas sales that will end Thursday morning.
[01:30:31.164 --> 01:30:34.005]  I'm cutting this on Tuesday morning.
[01:30:34.005 --> 01:30:43.449]  It's only going to run until Thursday morning and the sale will end up to 60% off double Patriot points and free shipping at info war store.com.
[01:30:43.449 --> 01:30:46.730]  So thanks for keeping us on the air while getting great products at the same time.
[01:30:46.730 --> 01:30:53.193]  Like Vitamineral Fusion, DNA Force Plus, Ultimate Bone Broth Formula, Ultimate Turmeric Formula and so much more.
[01:30:55.042 --> 01:30:56.791]  The sale ends in just two days!
[01:30:57.876 --> 01:31:01.438]  UN-run contact tracers aren't coming, they're here.
[01:31:01.438 --> 01:31:16.146]  All over the world, from Australia to the United States, from Canada to Germany, these tyrants are tracking everything you do, everywhere you go, and then coming to your house and threatening, in some cases actually, taking people away into the night to their facilities.
[01:31:16.146 --> 01:31:24.370]  And they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process, where they come and take, quote, healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[01:31:24.730 --> 01:31:26.531]  This is nothing less than martial law.
[01:31:26.531 --> 01:31:34.334]  And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high-quality Faraday cages, many of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning U.S.
[01:31:34.334 --> 01:31:37.695]  government military grade, at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:31:37.695 --> 01:31:43.478]  We have the entire line of Silent Pocket ready to ship to you when you visit InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:31:43.478 --> 01:31:50.581]  Again, we have big backpacks, we have special dry bags, we've got them for cell phones, we've got them for laptops, we've got them for iPads.
[01:31:50.581 --> 01:31:51.321]  It's all there.
[01:31:52.041 --> 01:31:52.901]  We're good to go.
[01:32:16.807 --> 01:32:23.971]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.
[01:32:23.971 --> 01:32:29.814]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[01:32:29.814 --> 01:32:38.519]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including
[01:32:39.199 --> 01:32:44.702]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:19.865 --> 01:33:24.969]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:33:24.969 --> 01:33:28.813]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:38.507 --> 01:33:42.568]  Let it be said on my tombstone that I'm part of Team Human.
[01:33:42.568 --> 01:33:49.390]  Let it be said that I was always true and did not back down in the face of these Satanists.
[01:33:49.390 --> 01:34:05.274]  Let it be said that I was a follower of Jesus Christ and I commit my soul into God's hands now publicly in front of all of you and you should be doing the same thing because across the planet children are dying and becoming ill and debilitated and
[01:34:07.918 --> 01:34:11.561]  You know, Dr. Robert Malone is the inventor of mRNA technology.
[01:34:11.561 --> 01:34:12.121]  He's a billionaire.
[01:34:36.772 --> 01:34:38.453]  He's come on our other shows.
[01:34:38.453 --> 01:34:39.233]  I'm too controversial.
[01:34:39.233 --> 01:34:39.633]  I understand.
[01:34:39.633 --> 01:34:40.034]  That's fine.
[01:34:40.034 --> 01:34:44.115]  We talked to him, but now I'm sure he will know that he's being banned everywhere.
[01:34:44.115 --> 01:34:48.938]  And I told my crew about six months ago, they said, you know, Malone saying, watch out, look out, but he's being careful.
[01:34:48.938 --> 01:34:55.761]  And I said, watch the fact that he's been criticizing this, even though he makes money off every person that's injected.
[01:34:55.761 --> 01:34:58.222]  The fact that he's saying back off, watch out, don't do this.
[01:34:58.222 --> 01:35:00.623]  He's got all the patents.
[01:35:00.623 --> 01:35:04.125]  I said, you watch that shows he has an inclination to be good.
[01:35:05.222 --> 01:35:12.226]  He's going to absolutely collapse into Christ's arms.
[01:35:12.226 --> 01:35:15.729]  And I said, he will end up being one of their biggest enemies.
[01:35:15.729 --> 01:35:20.031]  Because I could see him getting more hardcore as it went the last year and a half.
[01:35:20.031 --> 01:35:26.976]  And now you're about to see just total exposure.
[01:35:26.976 --> 01:35:29.978]  Because see, he's a good person.
[01:35:29.978 --> 01:35:33.500]  So he wants to believe people in the power structure must be like him.
[01:35:35.396 --> 01:35:43.479]  And he keeps thinking as he shows them what they've done wrong and the bad things they're doing, that they'll turn back, that they're not Dr. Malone, and you know that now, don't you?
[01:35:43.479 --> 01:35:43.979]  And he does.
[01:35:43.979 --> 01:35:53.683]  He now sounds just like Dr. Michael Yedon, who is the former chief scientist advisor, saying, this is depopulation, period.
[01:35:53.683 --> 01:35:55.924]  This is a plan to kill you and your family.
[01:35:55.924 --> 01:35:59.766]  We're not just saying that because it sounds shocking.
[01:35:59.766 --> 01:36:02.947]  You think Dr. Michael Yedon, who's also extremely wealthy,
[01:36:04.167 --> 01:36:06.969]  And holds a bunch of patents as well?
[01:36:06.969 --> 01:36:10.672]  And flies around on private helicopters and jets?
[01:36:10.672 --> 01:36:12.854]  You think he wants to start a fight with these people?
[01:36:12.854 --> 01:36:18.459]  But he can't sleep at night because he's got a soul!
[01:36:18.459 --> 01:36:23.122]  He's got a heart!
[01:36:23.122 --> 01:36:32.590]  Again, I could just list some of the top names, but I mean, the chief advisor to the European Union Health Commission, Dr. Wolfgang Wudart, we've interviewed him.
[01:36:35.529 --> 01:36:44.091]  Came out a year and a half ago and predicted every damn thing that's happened here.
[01:36:44.091 --> 01:36:45.851]  And what did he say?
[01:36:45.851 --> 01:36:48.492]  I mean, he's just the head EU advisor.
[01:36:48.492 --> 01:36:50.972]  Why should we listen to him?
[01:36:50.972 --> 01:36:53.012]  He's like Malone, the inventor of mRNA.
[01:36:53.012 --> 01:36:53.753]  Why do you listen to him?
[01:36:53.753 --> 01:36:56.193]  It's like asking Michael Jordan how to play basketball.
[01:36:56.193 --> 01:36:57.253]  It's ridiculous.
[01:36:57.253 --> 01:37:00.494]  It's like asking Tiger Woods or Jack Nicklaus how to play golf.
[01:37:04.986 --> 01:37:10.471]  It's like, I've got so much news here today.
[01:37:10.471 --> 01:37:16.936]  We've got investigative journalists joining us to cover it all, but my God, what have we done?
[01:37:16.936 --> 01:37:18.117]  What have we been a part of?
[01:37:18.117 --> 01:37:19.939]  What have we gone along with?
[01:37:19.939 --> 01:37:26.124]  What have we allowed ourselves to become?
[01:37:26.124 --> 01:37:28.486]  And all for just money and power in the system?
[01:37:28.486 --> 01:37:31.749]  You know, Harry Reid, a very corrupt, evil Chinese agent,
[01:37:33.755 --> 01:37:41.780]  Chinese Communist agent is dead at 82.
[01:37:41.780 --> 01:37:42.500]  And what a loss.
[01:37:42.500 --> 01:37:47.663]  He could have been a real human, but he was a servant of evil.
[01:37:47.663 --> 01:37:52.926]  And that's very, very, very, very, very sad, isn't it?
[01:37:52.926 --> 01:37:54.347]  Let me hit these articles right now.
[01:38:01.854 --> 01:38:04.937]  You know, Nancy Pelosi and all of them will soon be joining him.
[01:38:04.937 --> 01:38:06.938]  We'll all be joining him soon.
[01:38:06.938 --> 01:38:10.301]  Sooner rather than later.
[01:38:10.301 --> 01:38:11.843]  And what does it profit a man?
[01:38:11.843 --> 01:38:13.845]  Can we pull up a Bible verse?
[01:38:13.845 --> 01:38:19.810]  What does it profit a man to gain the world and give up his soul?
[01:38:19.810 --> 01:38:23.053]  And you do have a soul.
[01:38:23.053 --> 01:38:27.777]  I remember I was talking to a preacher one time, a well-known businessman, but he was a street preacher.
[01:38:30.441 --> 01:38:41.457]  And he said on air, he said, Alex, he said, would you give, would you take a billion dollars for your eyes?
[01:38:41.457 --> 01:38:42.518]  Would you take a billion dollars?
[01:38:42.518 --> 01:38:43.600]  I said, hell no.
[01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:44.801]  Would you take five billion?
[01:38:45.919 --> 01:38:54.002]  And I said, from a Christ-like position, I might, because I might be able to really help people with it, but still, I'm a little jealous of my eyes.
[01:38:54.002 --> 01:38:56.143]  I want to keep those.
[01:38:56.143 --> 01:38:57.624]  Probably no amount of money in the world.
[01:38:57.624 --> 01:38:59.445]  And he said, exactly.
[01:38:59.445 --> 01:39:04.827]  What would you give for your soul, your eternal will, who you are, what you're always going to be?
[01:39:04.827 --> 01:39:07.388]  Man, there's no price on that.
[01:39:09.864 --> 01:39:10.925]  But there is a price.
[01:39:10.925 --> 01:39:13.787]  And that's why the globals want to shut your food and water off.
[01:39:13.787 --> 01:39:16.570]  It's why they want to get total absolute control of you.
[01:39:16.570 --> 01:39:26.478]  To make you so poor and so desperate that you will do anything they want just to get food.
[01:39:27.924 --> 01:39:32.505]  And make you commit crimes against God by cutting off your resources.
[01:39:32.505 --> 01:39:37.046]  The devil in this system is not going to give you a universal income because it likes you.
[01:39:37.046 --> 01:39:39.166]  It's going to do it to control every facet of your life.
[01:39:39.166 --> 01:39:40.046]  And you know that.
[01:39:40.046 --> 01:39:40.707]  And it's here.
[01:39:40.707 --> 01:39:49.088]  In fact, I'll cover that next segment.
[01:39:49.088 --> 01:39:52.129]  But let's go out to break here in the last four minutes of this segment with
[01:39:55.057 --> 01:39:59.499]  Lockdown policies and mask mandates linked with lower IQ in children.
[01:39:59.499 --> 01:40:04.221]  Another gets the names like mandates and policies.
[01:40:04.221 --> 01:40:11.765]  They make this evil, this abuse of our children, the brain damage, the lowered IQs, all the things that happen to them, like it's cute, because it's just a policy.
[01:40:13.772 --> 01:40:19.055]  And this shock video, people being arrested at sit-ins and the left making fun of them.
[01:40:19.055 --> 01:40:22.778]  NYPD, Vax Passport Enforces Breakup of Child's Birthday.
[01:40:22.778 --> 01:40:25.220]  Party up for demanding vaccine passports.
[01:40:25.220 --> 01:40:26.560]  And then the arrestor made.
[01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:28.822]  I've got a bunch of videos of this.
[01:40:29.222 --> 01:40:30.964]  But look at this little boy.
[01:40:30.964 --> 01:40:39.110]  He just wanted to have a party where his parents made him the center of attention and where he celebrated things and had some pizza and got a Hot Wheels set.
[01:40:39.110 --> 01:40:41.632]  But instead, the police told him, you got to go.
[01:40:41.632 --> 01:40:46.156]  You didn't let us inject you with something that turns your immune system off and gives you a heart attack.
[01:40:46.156 --> 01:40:47.977]  And the police aren't even our enemy.
[01:40:47.977 --> 01:40:54.383]  The globalists are trying to destroy them, but the police are following their criminal orders to go do this.
[01:40:54.383 --> 01:40:57.965]  Let's go out to break with this poor little boy and the police.
[01:40:57.965 --> 01:40:58.346]  Here it is.
[01:41:00.358 --> 01:41:01.858]  They're all wearing their damn masks.
[01:41:01.858 --> 01:41:02.739]  Look at this cult.
[01:41:02.739 --> 01:41:03.659]  The endless emergency.
[01:41:03.659 --> 01:41:04.719]  The sign of the tyranny.
[01:41:04.719 --> 01:41:05.339]  Wear your mask!
[01:41:21.445 --> 01:41:21.825]  Need to leave.
[01:41:21.825 --> 01:41:23.025]  Little boy just wants to go.
[01:41:23.025 --> 01:41:24.126]  Go home with your family, son.
[01:41:24.126 --> 01:41:25.006]  These people are all gone.
[01:41:25.006 --> 01:41:25.186]  Wow.
[01:41:25.186 --> 01:41:25.666]  Scaring a child.
[01:41:25.666 --> 01:41:26.206]  Traumatizing a child.
[01:41:26.206 --> 01:41:27.287]  They've all submitted to Satan.
[01:41:27.287 --> 01:41:28.487]  Hope you feel good about yourself, NYPD.
[01:41:28.487 --> 01:41:29.007]  Depend on them.
[01:41:29.007 --> 01:41:29.407]  Depend on them.
[01:41:29.407 --> 01:41:29.768]  Depend on them.
[01:41:29.768 --> 01:41:30.228]  Depend on them.
[01:41:30.228 --> 01:41:30.608]  Depend on them.
[01:41:30.608 --> 01:41:31.568]  Depend on them.
[01:41:31.568 --> 01:41:32.308]  Depend on them.
[01:41:32.308 --> 01:41:32.848]  Depend on them.
[01:41:32.848 --> 01:41:33.269]  Depend on them.
[01:41:33.269 --> 01:41:33.949]  Depend on them.
[01:41:33.949 --> 01:41:34.609]  Depend on them.
[01:41:34.609 --> 01:41:34.969]  Depend on them.
[01:41:34.969 --> 01:41:35.409]  Depend on them.
[01:41:35.409 --> 01:41:35.769]  Depend on them.
[01:41:35.769 --> 01:41:36.189]  Depend on them.
[01:41:36.189 --> 01:41:37.110]  Depend on them.
[01:41:37.110 --> 01:41:37.570]  Depend on them.
[01:41:37.570 --> 01:41:39.130]  Depend on them.
[01:41:39.130 --> 01:41:39.590]  Depend on them.
[01:41:39.590 --> 01:41:40.171]  Depend on them.
[01:41:40.171 --> 01:41:40.651]  Depend on them.
[01:41:40.651 --> 01:41:41.111]  Depend on them.
[01:41:41.111 --> 01:41:41.671]  Depend on them.
[01:41:41.671 --> 01:41:42.351]  Depend on them.
[01:41:42.351 --> 01:41:42.891]  Depend on them.
[01:41:42.891 --> 01:41:43.352]  Depend on them.
[01:41:43.352 --> 01:41:43.772]  Depend on them.
[01:41:43.772 --> 01:41:44.292]  Depend on them.
[01:41:44.292 --> 01:41:44.972]  Depend on them.
[01:41:44.972 --> 01:41:45.512]  Depend on them.
[01:41:45.512 --> 01:41:46.733]  Depend on them.
[01:41:46.733 --> 01:41:47.213]  Depend on them.
[01:41:47.213 --> 01:41:47.713]  Depend on them.
[01:41:47.713 --> 01:41:48.053]  Depend on
[01:41:52.978 --> 01:41:54.599]  Okay, Mom, let's just get out of here.
[01:41:54.599 --> 01:41:55.460]  You all failed us.
[01:41:55.460 --> 01:41:57.801]  We're here for you and your kids.
[01:41:57.801 --> 01:41:59.582]  These are good women right here.
[01:41:59.582 --> 01:42:00.763]  Disgraceful.
[01:42:00.763 --> 01:42:03.004]  You failed yourself, NYPD.
[01:42:03.004 --> 01:42:03.745]  They'll be the future.
[01:42:03.745 --> 01:42:04.385]  You failed yourself.
[01:42:04.385 --> 01:42:05.546]  They'll build our future.
[01:42:05.546 --> 01:42:06.747]  Is this what you signed up for?
[01:42:06.747 --> 01:42:11.489]  Is this what justice looks like for you?
[01:42:11.489 --> 01:42:16.573]  Is this what you dreamed of when you wanted to be a cop?
[01:42:16.573 --> 01:42:19.674]  What they do is follow the criminal orders of that criminal pedophile mayor.
[01:42:25.123 --> 01:42:33.321]  Again, this is the criminal state trying to force into your body poisons that sterilize you and give you heart attacks.
[01:42:33.321 --> 01:42:34.323]  You don't want to be there.
[01:42:35.285 --> 01:42:41.151]  The police are there literally like errand boys leading your child into a firing squad of death.
[01:42:41.151 --> 01:42:42.713]  You don't need their filth.
[01:42:42.713 --> 01:42:44.695]  You don't need their stinking food.
[01:42:44.695 --> 01:42:45.416]  Go to the country.
[01:42:45.416 --> 01:42:46.477]  Grow your own food.
[01:42:46.477 --> 01:42:48.699]  We're all going to be in this position now.
[01:42:48.699 --> 01:42:52.143]  What are the vaccinated and unvaccinated having in common?
[01:42:52.143 --> 01:42:54.105]  No one is ever fully vaccinated.
[01:42:54.105 --> 01:42:54.726]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:58.303 --> 01:43:02.006]  Everything I do is about victory for humanity.
[01:43:02.006 --> 01:43:07.870]  Everything I promote is about standing up against the new world order by empowering humanity.
[01:43:07.870 --> 01:43:10.071]  Well, that's why ResetWars.com is so important.
[01:43:10.071 --> 01:43:24.602]  Not only is it a game-changing course of critical information to unlock your mind from the matrix, but it's something that gets around Klaus Schwab's attempt to shut down American infrastructure and American jobs.
[01:43:25.322 --> 01:43:27.525]  It is the true digital economy.
[01:43:27.525 --> 01:43:31.689]  It's the spiritual economy of the mind and transcendental control.
[01:43:32.694 --> 01:43:40.760]  I've been on there 28 years, and all of our work has been amazing, thanks to God and God's divine empowerment and blessing.
[01:43:40.760 --> 01:43:46.685]  But I've got to tell you, out of everything I've done, Reset Wars is the most important, and it is now available.
[01:43:46.685 --> 01:43:51.409]  Now, the month of December 2021 is here at ResetWars.com.
[01:43:51.409 --> 01:43:55.532]  Start your journey to the next level today at ResetWars.com.
[01:43:55.532 --> 01:43:57.814]  The globalists fear this information.
[01:43:59.469 --> 01:44:06.933]  It's only been in the last 60 years that we've had satellites that can decently measure what's happening in the atmosphere.
[01:44:06.933 --> 01:44:14.036]  But if you look at all the different studies and reports put out by NASA and other governments and other agencies, they all disagree on what's really happening to the climate.
[01:44:14.827 --> 01:44:20.369]  The only constant, the only great truth is change is the only constant.
[01:44:20.369 --> 01:44:23.130]  So yes, climate change is totally real.
[01:44:23.130 --> 01:44:30.012]  But notice first they called it global freezing back in the 70s and 80s and then it's gonna be global warming and that didn't really happen the way they wanted it to.
[01:44:30.012 --> 01:44:32.053]  Okay, now it's just climate change.
[01:44:32.053 --> 01:44:34.054]  But did you know that man-made climate change
[01:44:34.854 --> 01:44:41.437]  ...is a real thing when it comes to the United Nations and the Department of Energy and Bill Gates and the UN.
[01:44:41.437 --> 01:44:44.498]  They have weather control treaties from 1979.
[01:44:44.498 --> 01:44:48.280]  Bill Gates has been manipulating the weather for a very long time.
[01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:55.183]  In fact, back in 1994, two scientists won a Nobel Prize for an idea of spraying different particles out of jet engines to control the weather.
[01:44:55.183 --> 01:44:56.964]  So yes, man-made climate change is real.
[01:44:58.553 --> 01:45:03.919]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action, and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[01:45:03.919 --> 01:45:13.329]  Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly, and debilitating experimental injection because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[01:45:13.969 --> 01:45:23.914]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years.
[01:45:23.914 --> 01:45:30.697]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening and it's unbelievably unsettling to see.
[01:45:30.697 --> 01:45:32.118]  But there is only two things to do.
[01:45:33.238 --> 01:45:36.380]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[01:45:36.380 --> 01:45:39.701]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[01:45:39.701 --> 01:45:45.084]  But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to an end.
[01:45:45.084 --> 01:45:46.925]  And so, we must prepare.
[01:45:46.925 --> 01:45:56.970]  Get up to a year's worth of storable foods, water filtration, survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios, and life-saving knowledge at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:46:00.307 --> 01:46:02.468]  Get our grate and a bag of it here.
[01:46:02.468 --> 01:46:05.948]  I mean, this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico?
[01:46:05.948 --> 01:46:07.049]  The communist!
[01:46:07.049 --> 01:46:14.390]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested, above organic, in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee.
[01:46:14.390 --> 01:46:19.672]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that, you know, the media calls communists, but really they're just a commune and whatever.
[01:46:19.672 --> 01:46:24.393]  The point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[01:46:24.393 --> 01:46:28.794]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for what, 14 years and the price has never gone up.
[01:46:28.794 --> 01:46:30.094]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods.
[01:46:30.094 --> 01:46:30.434]  We're good to go.
[01:46:59.918 --> 01:47:04.552]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:47:04.552 --> 01:47:05.836]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:47:29.949 --> 01:47:42.899]  Here's a clip from... It was two months, it was six months, it was eight months, now it's like, it's two years, it's five years, it's ten years, and the UN goes, no Gates, it's not ten years, it's forever.
[01:47:42.899 --> 01:47:45.781]  It's a power grab.
[01:47:45.781 --> 01:47:52.746]  Alright, so here is a clip that we just played from December of last year.
[01:47:55.211 --> 01:48:07.820]  It was 15 days, and it was 2 months, it was 6 months, it was 8 months, now it's like, it's 2 years, it's 5 years, it's 10 years, and the UN goes, no Gates, it's not 10 years, it's forever!
[01:48:07.820 --> 01:48:12.024]  It's a power grab!
[01:48:12.024 --> 01:48:22.171]  And of course, you don't need me to tell you that's the case, but when they tell you there's a global collapse, and they say COVID caused it, no.
[01:48:22.171 --> 01:48:24.593]  We're... Here's the big enchilada.
[01:48:26.127 --> 01:48:39.610]  We're at the end of the New World Order Central Bank Ponzi scheme that they've used to buy up control of the world with just quadrillions in fake currency.
[01:48:39.610 --> 01:48:53.753]  And now they need a way, when they let you know that all your money's a fraud, but they've got all the real assets, that it's a good thing by, oh, the world system collapsed first through the healthcare system.
[01:48:55.509 --> 01:48:58.371]  And then it collapsed into everything else.
[01:48:58.371 --> 01:49:01.372]  And that's why this happens.
[01:49:01.372 --> 01:49:07.976]  That's why the WHO warns health system collapse is now here.
[01:49:07.976 --> 01:49:11.258]  Just like they tell you, oh, hundreds of millions are starving to death.
[01:49:11.258 --> 01:49:13.520]  Oh, when they ordered the lockdowns that did it.
[01:49:13.520 --> 01:49:17.462]  This isn't even debatable.
[01:49:17.462 --> 01:49:24.126]  But they're now going to pose as the saviors while all of this happens.
[01:49:26.676 --> 01:49:27.696]  And here's the headlines.
[01:49:27.696 --> 01:49:33.218]  COVID tsunami will drive healthcare systems towards collapse, says the head of the WHO.
[01:49:33.218 --> 01:49:36.119]  Who's been running the whole thing.
[01:49:36.119 --> 01:49:44.122]  Just say it, the healthcare system has collapsed, reports Slate.
[01:49:44.122 --> 01:49:47.263]  Oh, he passed away while waiting for a hospital bed.
[01:49:47.263 --> 01:49:53.145]  Not because of COVID overwhelming the hospitals, but because they fired a third of the nurses and doctors.
[01:49:53.145 --> 01:49:54.305]  But they don't tell you that.
[01:49:56.640 --> 01:50:03.725]  All a planned collapse, or the first six months of the lockdown where millions of people died from not getting medical care.
[01:50:03.725 --> 01:50:10.569]  Now Fauci says the shortened COVID-19 isolation from a couple weeks to five days was designed to give people back to jobs.
[01:50:10.569 --> 01:50:12.070]  So they've already collapsed the world.
[01:50:12.070 --> 01:50:14.172]  They already know the hyperinflation's here.
[01:50:14.172 --> 01:50:15.432]  They already know it's all happening.
[01:50:15.432 --> 01:50:16.273]  They've done their job.
[01:50:16.273 --> 01:50:21.997]  It's like shooting you five or six times with a gun, with hollow-point bullets, and you're laying there bleeding to death.
[01:50:21.997 --> 01:50:23.998]  And they come over and they go, hey, here's a Band-Aid.
[01:50:23.998 --> 01:50:25.319]  Why don't you clean yourself up?
[01:50:26.257 --> 01:50:30.979]  Here's some bandages, and here's a Band-Aid, and here's some Bactine.
[01:50:30.979 --> 01:50:33.500]  Why don't you, you're like, I've been shot, help me.
[01:50:33.500 --> 01:50:35.461]  Oh, oh, I'm so sorry.
[01:50:35.461 --> 01:50:39.283]  Here's a Band-Aid.
[01:50:39.283 --> 01:50:43.525]  Hospitals beg fired nurses to come home, to come back.
[01:50:43.525 --> 01:50:47.767]  I mean, the shortage is, oh, but you already got the collapse going.
[01:50:47.767 --> 01:50:54.390]  And now the very people that did it, the UN and Fauci and Gates and Anderson Cooper,
[01:50:55.731 --> 01:51:00.175]  They can now tell you, oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:51:00.175 --> 01:51:02.377]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:51:02.377 --> 01:51:08.643]  No one wants to take away your social security or not let you fly or have a job.
[01:51:08.643 --> 01:51:10.644]  They were all just saying it a week ago.
[01:51:10.644 --> 01:51:12.166]  No one ever said that.
[01:51:14.042 --> 01:51:15.283]  You go, what's the point of that?
[01:51:15.283 --> 01:51:18.806]  They squeeze ya, and you start to find out, oh, nobody's squeezing!
[01:51:18.806 --> 01:51:22.090]  As soon as you lay back down, they attack again.
[01:51:22.090 --> 01:51:29.857]  All behavioral psychologists, all criminal, coward, filth of the earth, that believe in their own power over you, that's their only God.
[01:51:31.124 --> 01:51:32.425]  And how do you beat trash?
[01:51:32.425 --> 01:51:33.905]  You learn about trash.
[01:51:33.905 --> 01:51:35.586]  You learn how trash operates.
[01:51:35.586 --> 01:51:37.187]  You learn to have a memory.
[01:51:37.187 --> 01:51:45.530]  You learn, instead of knowing about football scores or, you know, all the rest of the stuff that men do or what women do about how to get their nails done, their lashes done.
[01:51:45.530 --> 01:51:53.573]  That's all fine, but don't be an expert in lashes and nails or your favorite TV show, you know, Yellowstone or whatever.
[01:51:53.573 --> 01:51:57.235]  Live in the real world and realize real monsters are coming after you.
[01:51:58.715 --> 01:51:59.595]  I'm unknocking Yellowstone.
[01:51:59.595 --> 01:52:02.197]  I choose that as half my family watches it constantly.
[01:52:02.197 --> 01:52:05.098]  And you know, I got friends that are in it and all the rest of it.
[01:52:05.098 --> 01:52:06.218]  I don't even pay attention to it.
[01:52:06.218 --> 01:52:07.399]  Not because I'm above it.
[01:52:07.399 --> 01:52:08.179]  I'm in a war.
[01:52:08.179 --> 01:52:14.422]  I don't have time to go watch Fantasyland.
[01:52:14.422 --> 01:52:15.262]  You know, here's an example.
[01:52:15.262 --> 01:52:20.825]  This morning I walked in, I heard a caller on American Journal with Harrison Smith, did a great job.
[01:52:20.825 --> 01:52:22.886]  And the caller said, have you seen the full
[01:52:23.729 --> 01:52:32.073]  Justin Trudeau clipped last week where he gave a press conference in a mask to scare everybody and said, we're destroying your fundamental liberties and erasing them.
[01:52:32.073 --> 01:52:40.657]  And yeah, it's in the charter that you have rights, but we have a right to erase those under the Queen and her Director General.
[01:52:40.657 --> 01:52:42.518]  The caller said, haven't you seen the full clip?
[01:52:43.379 --> 01:52:43.999]  We hadn't.
[01:52:43.999 --> 01:53:00.046]  I watched the clip, and then we probably forgot, but I said, as soon as Rob Dewey gets in, or one of the people, get him and then have the clip from Star Wars, Episode 4, where they walk into the Death Star, and he goes, if the Imperial Senate hears of what we've done, they will absolutely rebel.
[01:53:00.046 --> 01:53:03.528]  The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us.
[01:53:03.528 --> 01:53:07.490]  The Emperor has just dissolved the Senate.
[01:53:07.490 --> 01:53:10.851]  Now the regional governors will keep the systems in line.
[01:53:10.851 --> 01:53:12.052]  He says, well, that's impossible.
[01:53:13.117 --> 01:53:16.698]  Without the regional bureaucracy, who will control the population?
[01:53:16.698 --> 01:53:19.720]  He says fear will keep the local systems in line.
[01:53:19.720 --> 01:53:24.622]  Fear of this battle station!
[01:53:24.622 --> 01:53:26.162]  And what is the battle station?
[01:53:26.162 --> 01:53:27.143]  It's COVID.
[01:53:27.143 --> 01:53:27.943]  It's the UN.
[01:53:27.943 --> 01:53:29.024]  It's the hysteria.
[01:53:29.024 --> 01:53:33.786]  It's the fear.
[01:53:33.786 --> 01:53:37.027]  So I want to take the clip of Trudeau saying literally,
[01:53:37.805 --> 01:53:40.047]  We don't need regional governments anymore.
[01:53:40.047 --> 01:53:42.830]  The governors will keep the local provinces in line.
[01:53:42.830 --> 01:53:47.834]  He's literally quoting Governor Tarkin from episode 4, 1977.
[01:53:47.834 --> 01:54:01.386]  I mean, I mean, I mean, the tyranny is so bad, it's a Star Wars script at this point.
[01:54:01.386 --> 01:54:02.227]  That's impossible.
[01:54:02.227 --> 01:54:04.109]  Who controls the systems without the bureaucracy?
[01:54:06.414 --> 01:54:11.055]  The governors will now have direct control over their territories.
[01:54:11.055 --> 01:54:13.516]  And fear will keep the local systems in line.
[01:54:13.516 --> 01:54:16.497]  Fear of this battle station.
[01:54:16.497 --> 01:54:22.878]  And just like that, you're inside the New World Order.
[01:54:22.878 --> 01:54:24.859]  Think about that!
[01:54:24.859 --> 01:54:29.200]  I mean, the Prime Minister of Canada says, I want to be a dictator!
[01:54:29.200 --> 01:54:30.320]  I want to be like China!
[01:54:31.898 --> 01:54:33.219]  I want dictatorship!
[01:54:33.219 --> 01:54:35.000]  I admire dictatorship!
[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:40.783]  And two years later, he's up there saying, we're dissolving the local governments.
[01:54:40.783 --> 01:54:43.545]  We're in direct control now.
[01:54:43.545 --> 01:54:49.809]  And he's like, in his chair going, we're in control now.
[01:54:49.809 --> 01:54:55.272]  Well, to quote Darth Vader, don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed.
[01:54:56.226 --> 01:55:02.055]  These globalists have bet everything on their AI takeover system, and I can tell you it's going to fail.
[01:55:02.055 --> 01:55:04.700]  And that leads me to this latest little juicy.
[01:55:12.296 --> 01:55:14.837]  Oh, but remember, no one ever wanted to lock you down.
[01:55:14.837 --> 01:55:17.197]  No one ever wanted to make you take a shot.
[01:55:17.197 --> 01:55:19.258]  No one wanted to ever take your Social Security.
[01:55:19.258 --> 01:55:20.438]  They all just said it.
[01:55:20.438 --> 01:55:23.039]  Kathleen Sebelius, no freedom for the unvaccinated.
[01:55:23.039 --> 01:55:27.761]  Don't let them lose, leave their houses, take their bank accounts.
[01:55:27.761 --> 01:55:29.001]  Oh yeah, they all just said it.
[01:55:32.605 --> 01:55:34.626]  But look at this little piece of news.
[01:55:34.626 --> 01:55:43.831]  China introduces AI prosecutor that can automatically charge citizens of a crime and now the US and Europe wants it.
[01:55:43.831 --> 01:55:47.934]  Oh man, and it's a robot judge too!
[01:55:47.934 --> 01:55:49.335]  And wait, it gets better.
[01:55:49.335 --> 01:55:53.457]  China's working on robots that actually come and arrest you.
[01:55:53.457 --> 01:55:57.519]  Just like that, humans are out of the equation.
[01:55:57.519 --> 01:56:01.642]  Because the militaries are all busy putting pregnant women, you know, in jump school and
[01:56:03.032 --> 01:56:05.856]  You know, the trans swimmers are too busy beating all the women.
[01:56:05.856 --> 01:56:07.339]  We can't have a human military.
[01:56:07.339 --> 01:56:12.306]  We've got a robot one though, and they follow orders and they erase things they're supposed to.
[01:56:12.306 --> 01:56:14.790]  And they do whatever they're told.
[01:56:14.790 --> 01:56:15.772]  What a time to be alive.
[01:56:18.297 --> 01:56:18.637]  All right.
[01:56:18.637 --> 01:56:19.858]  We're going to go to break.
[01:56:19.858 --> 01:56:22.378]  This broadcast is a one of a kind tip of the spear.
[01:56:22.378 --> 01:56:22.779]  Absolutely.
[01:56:22.779 --> 01:56:23.439]  God sent.
[01:56:23.439 --> 01:56:24.539]  I'm very blessed to be here.
[01:56:24.539 --> 01:56:25.900]  You are God sent.
[01:56:25.900 --> 01:56:27.320]  All of you are amazing.
[01:56:27.320 --> 01:56:29.481]  Please continue to support the broadcast.
[01:56:29.481 --> 01:56:31.702]  God's got a plan, not just Satan.
[01:56:31.702 --> 01:56:35.903]  This is all a big test for us, but we've got to stay in this fight now harder than ever.
[01:56:35.903 --> 01:56:39.104]  We can't do it without your support and we make it easy.
[01:56:39.104 --> 01:56:40.344]  Today is the last day in 2021.
[01:56:42.677 --> 01:56:43.257]  We're good to go.
[01:56:57.574 --> 01:57:14.717]  Turbo Force, Brain Force Plus, all of it, 40-60% off, storewide free shipping, double Patriot points, the best deal of the year, all Patriot apparel, at cost, all the ball caps, all the sweaters, all the t-shirts, all of it, a piece of Americana resistance history.
[01:57:15.237 --> 01:57:24.184]  The fluoride-free toothpaste with the iodine and the other amazing things that are in it, like the tea tree oil, the super whitening toothpaste, and the charcoal toothpaste.
[01:57:24.184 --> 01:57:25.165]  It's all discounted.
[01:57:25.165 --> 01:57:27.567]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:57:32.330 --> 01:57:37.053]  888-253-3139 and you have kept us on air and it's all in God's plan.
[01:57:37.053 --> 01:57:42.937]  But now I can tell you we're reaching the crescendo of the battle and I need your prayer, your word of mouth, and your finances now.
[01:57:42.937 --> 01:57:44.738]  We'll be back with hour number three.
[01:57:44.738 --> 01:57:48.340]  Stay with us.
[01:57:48.340 --> 01:57:58.946]  Well, if Infowars was battle-hardened and wounded and punished and tortured and demonized and lied about in the last 20 plus years, we've really gone through
[01:58:00.017 --> 01:58:01.978]  The most destructive year we've ever seen.
[01:58:01.978 --> 01:58:04.238]  But so is the country, so is the world.
[01:58:04.238 --> 01:58:07.659]  And InfoWars intends to go into the thick of the fight.
[01:58:07.659 --> 01:58:09.160]  We intend to get attacked.
[01:58:09.160 --> 01:58:11.021]  We also intend to win.
[01:58:11.021 --> 01:58:13.361]  But we can't do that without working together.
[01:58:13.361 --> 01:58:18.143]  So I wanted to thank all of you in this insane year of 2021 for your support.
[01:58:18.663 --> 01:58:18.903]  Thank you.
[01:58:48.069 --> 01:58:51.470]  Not just across the United States, but across the world.
[01:58:51.470 --> 01:58:56.891]  You see it on the sides of barns, and on bumper stickers, on cars, and written on the side of bathroom walls.
[01:58:56.891 --> 01:58:58.491]  Alex Jones was right.
[01:58:58.491 --> 01:59:07.433]  That's become a maxim of people to communicate to others that they see through the fraud of the New World Order, that they're saying no to Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, and the Great Reset.
[01:59:07.433 --> 01:59:10.794]  And so now, Infowars credibility is stronger than it's ever been.
[01:59:11.434 --> 01:59:16.899]  And the globalists are now coming to try to shut us down after all their other attacks, and we can't let them do that.
[01:59:16.899 --> 01:59:19.601]  So, you've invested in Infowars over the years.
[01:59:19.601 --> 01:59:23.344]  I'm asking you to redouble those efforts now at this critical juncture.
[01:59:23.344 --> 01:59:26.127]  For everything you've done in the past is for nothing.
[01:59:26.727 --> 01:59:30.650]  You have invested in justice and the truth and hardcore populace.
[01:59:30.650 --> 01:59:32.772]  You have done incredible things.
[01:59:32.772 --> 01:59:40.418]  And I'm telling you now, going into 2022, InfoWars has major underages to run our operation and we need more funds in.
[01:59:40.418 --> 01:59:41.459]  So it's a 360 win.
[01:59:41.459 --> 01:59:45.142]  Get great products that are great for you and your family, your immune system, and so much more.
[01:59:45.142 --> 01:59:51.447]  So please go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:59:51.447 --> 01:59:55.350]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:10.202 --> 02:00:20.632]  Alright, Dr. Robert Malone, the inventor of mRNA technology, has been banned on Twitter for just saying what Fauci said, that you should really be careful with children.
[02:00:20.632 --> 02:00:23.714]  Taking the shot, it can cause AD and other problems.
[02:00:23.714 --> 02:00:34.104]  But a little bird told me that Malone's going to be doing a very big interview in the next 48 hours, and I'll just leave it at that.
[02:00:34.104 --> 02:00:36.006]  So, a lot is happening.
[02:00:38.393 --> 02:00:53.385]  Now, I saw this article yesterday, and I spent about an hour and a half reading the whole thing and watching the videos that were in it, and I didn't even scratch the surface of it, but major computer science engineer, multi-billion dollar company he's founded and run.
[02:00:53.385 --> 02:01:01.632]  Steve Kirsch is going to be joining us next segment from kirsch.substack.com to get into this huge, huge article.
[02:01:02.807 --> 02:01:05.087]  That we also posted at InfoWars.com.
[02:01:05.087 --> 02:01:14.089]  Pathology results show 93% of people who died after being vaccinated were killed by the vaccine.
[02:01:14.089 --> 02:01:15.309]  There's the InfoWars version.
[02:01:15.309 --> 02:01:17.530]  There's the Substack version.
[02:01:17.530 --> 02:01:19.690]  Right there.
[02:01:19.690 --> 02:01:24.231]  And he's reporting on what well-known, respected pathologists are saying.
[02:01:24.231 --> 02:01:31.292]  So we're going to walk through all of this here today.
[02:01:31.292 --> 02:01:31.492]  Wow.
[02:01:33.399 --> 02:01:47.600]  And then we've also got a bunch of other big reports out from VAERS that are admitting just massive, massive miscarriages, cancer, heart attacks.
[02:01:48.792 --> 02:01:54.614]  And when you look at the Harvard study saying 1% or so get reported, I mean, I can't even imagine what this is going to do.
[02:01:54.614 --> 02:02:01.837]  It's going to break down society, which we've been saying for years since this started, which is what the UN says, oh, the medical system is going to collapse.
[02:02:01.837 --> 02:02:07.980]  No, the rollout of these shots, the blocking of therapeutics, the hysteria is going to bring society down.
[02:02:07.980 --> 02:02:14.463]  And now we've got the UN, again, one of the main authors of this, posing as the saviors.
[02:02:14.463 --> 02:02:15.283]  We'll talk about that.
[02:02:16.616 --> 02:02:35.051]  With Mr. Kirsch as well, but listen, I love this audience, and I love people that are awake, and I respect you, and I appreciate all of you watching and listening right now, because there are conservatively, most shows exaggerate, there's probably two million people conservatively watching or listening right now, one way or another.
[02:02:35.051 --> 02:02:39.414]  And then later this archive will go up, and a million will probably watch that.
[02:02:39.414 --> 02:02:41.856]  There's seven and a half billion people.
[02:02:41.856 --> 02:02:43.337]  There's 340 million in the U.S.
[02:02:43.337 --> 02:02:43.878]  conservatively.
[02:02:45.447 --> 02:03:05.812]  I really want to change the world, and if you take this interview later when it's archived, or while it's live, and if you take clips of it or share it, or get Mr. Kirsch on yourself, whatever you do, magnify this truth, go research it, find out it's true, and then magnify it, and then here's the key.
[02:03:07.017 --> 02:03:08.898]  It's not good enough to tell other people about it.
[02:03:08.898 --> 02:03:10.339]  You've got to tell them.
[02:03:10.339 --> 02:03:19.926]  Once you think this is important, once you see it's true, please tell others to share it, and then tell them to share it, and tell them to share it.
[02:03:19.926 --> 02:03:22.408]  Everybody knows that human trait of, hey, pass it on.
[02:03:25.109 --> 02:03:26.410]  Romans are looking for Spartacus.
[02:03:26.410 --> 02:03:29.592]  He just, you know, lost his battle.
[02:03:29.592 --> 02:03:31.013]  Everybody says, hey, we're all Spartacus.
[02:03:31.013 --> 02:03:31.493]  Pass it down.
[02:03:31.493 --> 02:03:32.074]  I'm Spartacus.
[02:03:32.074 --> 02:03:32.634]  I'm Spartacus.
[02:03:32.634 --> 02:03:33.334]  I'm Spartacus.
[02:03:33.334 --> 02:03:35.736]  So they can't find Spartacus, even though they've already killed him.
[02:03:35.736 --> 02:03:36.657]  They don't know they killed him.
[02:03:36.657 --> 02:03:38.618]  Because they're all Spartacus now.
[02:03:38.618 --> 02:03:44.862]  When you decide to take this life-saving interview you're about to see, because a lot of people are already dying, but we're sad they died.
[02:03:44.862 --> 02:03:46.123]  We tried to stop it.
[02:03:46.123 --> 02:03:47.924]  But what about all the other children?
[02:03:47.924 --> 02:03:49.485]  What about all the other innocents?
[02:03:49.485 --> 02:03:50.966]  What about all the other people?
[02:03:50.966 --> 02:03:53.428]  We've got a responsibility to do this.
[02:03:54.525 --> 02:03:58.889]  And so I want you to take the live feed from InfoWars.com forward slash show and share it.
[02:03:58.889 --> 02:04:00.571]  Some places don't even share that URL.
[02:04:00.571 --> 02:04:03.693]  So share FreeWorldNews.tv.
[02:04:03.693 --> 02:04:06.396]  That's the URL from Band.Video.
[02:04:06.396 --> 02:04:18.087]  FreeWorldNews, one word, FreeWorldNews, FreeWorldNews.tv and explain, hey, major pathology results, you know, pathologists, those are the coroners.
[02:04:20.773 --> 02:04:26.035]  93% of people who died after being vaccinated were killed by the vaccine.
[02:04:26.035 --> 02:04:27.155]  And that's confirmed.
[02:04:27.155 --> 02:04:28.896]  And that's what numbers are showing everywhere else.
[02:04:28.896 --> 02:04:37.299]  So, I know most of you get this, but for the vast majority of the tune in, you gotta understand, you can't be a spectator in this.
[02:04:37.299 --> 02:04:41.701]  We're gonna lose this unless you take action now.
[02:04:41.701 --> 02:04:42.561]  So I'm counting on you.
[02:04:43.968 --> 02:04:45.691]  You're counting on yourself.
[02:04:45.691 --> 02:04:47.074]  And we got to do this.
[02:04:47.074 --> 02:04:48.076]  All right.
[02:04:48.076 --> 02:04:53.628]  Our special guest, investigative journalist, famous computer engineer, Ann Moore joins us.
[02:04:53.628 --> 02:04:53.988]  Stay with us.
[02:04:59.006 --> 02:05:00.827]  2021 has been an incredible year.
[02:05:00.827 --> 02:05:05.808]  It's been an incredible year for evil, but it's also been an amazing year for the global awakening.
[02:05:05.808 --> 02:05:07.828]  It's hard to believe it's almost over.
[02:05:07.828 --> 02:05:14.490]  Christmas 2021 is now a thing of history, and we are plunging into the most critical year, not just in U.S.
[02:05:14.490 --> 02:05:16.970]  history, but world history, in my view.
[02:05:16.970 --> 02:05:19.771]  So please continue to spread the word about InfoWars.
[02:05:19.771 --> 02:05:25.312]  Please continue to pray for the broadcast, because all of us together, including you, the viewers and listeners, are the tip of the spear.
[02:05:25.772 --> 02:05:31.217]  And take advantage of Christmas sales that will end Thursday morning.
[02:05:31.217 --> 02:05:33.819]  I'm cutting this on Tuesday morning.
[02:05:33.819 --> 02:05:43.487]  It's only going to run until Thursday morning, and the sale will end up to 60% off, double Patriot points, and free shipping at mfulworthstore.com.
[02:05:43.487 --> 02:05:50.794]  So thanks for keeping us on the air while getting great products at the same time, like Vitamineral Fusion, DNA Force Plus, Ultimate Bone Broth Formula,
[02:05:51.354 --> 02:05:52.035]  Alright, well, last night...
[02:06:12.845 --> 02:06:13.706]  It was about 10 p.m.
[02:06:13.706 --> 02:06:25.897]  I was gonna go to bed early and I went to InfoWars.com and I saw a link to the latest article by Steve Kirsch and I spent over an hour and a half reading it and watching the videos and only got through part of it.
[02:06:25.897 --> 02:06:33.384]  It's a very lengthy well-documented report and I've done so much research I knew that a lot of it I'd already seen other places but there was a lot of new information.
[02:06:34.045 --> 02:06:37.888]  Which was really sad because I wish this wasn't true, but it is true.
[02:06:37.888 --> 02:06:41.691]  Steve Kersh is a philanthropist and executive director of COVID-19 Early Treatment Fund.
[02:06:41.691 --> 02:06:44.354]  He's also the Vaccine Safety Research Foundation.
[02:06:44.354 --> 02:06:49.878]  He is the inventor of the optical mouse and one of the first internet search engines, InfoSeek.
[02:06:49.878 --> 02:06:54.142]  He has founded seven high-tech companies with $2 billion market caps.
[02:06:55.461 --> 02:06:59.062]  Steve is currently focused on safe and effective ways to end the pandemic.
[02:06:59.062 --> 02:07:02.242]  He received his B.S.M.S.
[02:07:02.242 --> 02:07:05.563]  in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT in 1980.
[02:07:05.563 --> 02:07:10.064]  He's been featured on 60 Minutes and basically everywhere else.
[02:07:10.064 --> 02:07:15.385]  stevekirsch.substack.com or on Twitter at Steve Kirsch or S.T.
[02:07:15.385 --> 02:07:17.525]  Kirsch and Gab on S.T.
[02:07:17.525 --> 02:07:18.625]  Kirsch.
[02:07:18.625 --> 02:07:20.485]  So good to have you here.
[02:07:20.485 --> 02:07:23.306]  We've got a lot obviously to cover.
[02:07:24.475 --> 02:07:39.767]  Uh, here with you, but you've got this extremely informative and shocking report out that 93% pathology results show 93% of people who died after being vaccinated were killed by the vaccine.
[02:07:39.767 --> 02:07:42.289]  We'll unpack that first.
[02:07:42.289 --> 02:07:46.333]  Then all your other big bombshell articles that are completely linked to documented 360 times increase the rate
[02:07:49.042 --> 02:07:49.342]  I don't know.
[02:08:09.477 --> 02:08:10.617]  My pleasure.
[02:08:10.617 --> 02:08:21.580]  It's good to be here and I'm back alive on Twitter after being permanently suspended, so it's good to be among the living on Twitter as well.
[02:08:21.580 --> 02:08:25.462]  Although, I discovered today that my friend Robert Malone, who has 512,000
[02:08:27.402 --> 02:08:32.344]  Subscribers on Twitter was removed as you mentioned earlier.
[02:08:32.344 --> 02:08:34.105]  He actually hasn't logged in yet.
[02:08:34.105 --> 02:08:40.727]  His wife told me about it and and of course a lot of people noticed that.
[02:08:40.727 --> 02:08:43.888]  So he wasn't sure why they removed him or which tweet it was.
[02:08:43.888 --> 02:08:44.829]  He had no notice.
[02:08:44.829 --> 02:08:51.151]  He was just his account was just suspended and his wife told him it was it was permanent.
[02:08:51.978 --> 02:09:03.067]  But I think he's going to get his revenge in the next 48 hours, because I think his interview that's upcoming will be extremely widely distributed.
[02:09:03.067 --> 02:09:05.349]  A lot of people are going to hear about that.
[02:09:05.349 --> 02:09:09.632]  Oh, so I guess he's the same little bird told you, huh?
[02:09:09.632 --> 02:09:11.193]  Well, I got it right.
[02:09:11.193 --> 02:09:12.874]  He was on his way to the airport.
[02:09:12.874 --> 02:09:14.155]  Let's put it that way.
[02:09:14.155 --> 02:09:14.676]  All right.
[02:09:14.676 --> 02:09:16.157]  I talked to Robert this morning.
[02:09:16.157 --> 02:09:17.258]  He's on his way to the airport.
[02:09:18.251 --> 02:09:19.551]  And you know where he's going.
[02:09:19.551 --> 02:09:24.633]  So do you think they might have preemptively learned about that and done that because of this?
[02:09:24.633 --> 02:09:25.693]  Um, I don't know.
[02:09:25.693 --> 02:09:29.834]  I don't think so because it's not well known.
[02:09:29.834 --> 02:09:33.896]  I don't think very many people knew about what's what's going on.
[02:09:33.896 --> 02:09:41.358]  So I think it was more that he he tweeted a particular story that they didn't want people to see.
[02:09:43.721 --> 02:09:44.322]  Absolutely.
[02:09:44.322 --> 02:09:45.363]  We should go back and review that.
[02:09:45.363 --> 02:09:50.868]  I know he put out an emergency warning to parents about the shot, and now even Israeli scientists are warning.
[02:09:50.868 --> 02:09:52.529]  I mean, they've got a big problem on their hands.
[02:09:52.529 --> 02:09:55.071]  I don't see how they cover this up now, what's happening.
[02:09:55.071 --> 02:10:02.238]  In fact, spend a few minutes on that and we'll get into your big article, but the latest just on the state of the shots, what they really are, what's happening.
[02:10:04.911 --> 02:10:10.153]  Well, you know, we're seeing just terrible results everywhere.
[02:10:10.153 --> 02:10:17.795]  There is a new Denmark study showing that the boosters are only effective for about 30 days.
[02:10:17.795 --> 02:10:20.156]  And after that, it starts to go negative.
[02:10:21.047 --> 02:10:32.578]  And so in other words, instead of the vaccine helping you and keeping you from getting infected, the vaccines are now going to help you to get infected.
[02:10:32.578 --> 02:10:35.741]  So the vaccines are doing the exact opposite.
[02:10:36.361 --> 02:10:37.621]  Of what you're told.
[02:10:37.621 --> 02:10:47.984]  And this is in a Denmark study, and it showed that for Omicron in particular, the vaccine efficacy turns negative after about 60 days.
[02:10:47.984 --> 02:10:57.346]  And negative vaccine efficacy means the vaccine is actually on the side of the virus, not on helping you, protecting you from the virus.
[02:10:57.346 --> 02:10:58.787]  What is the mechanism of that?
[02:10:58.787 --> 02:11:02.808]  Because I've seen the studies that it turns off white blood cells and things.
[02:11:02.808 --> 02:11:03.668]  What's really going on there?
[02:11:04.659 --> 02:11:12.947]  Yeah, so we don't really quite know all of the details, but there's a lot of things that do happen.
[02:11:12.947 --> 02:11:18.051]  Your immune system gets suppressed every time you get jabbed.
[02:11:18.051 --> 02:11:25.038]  And so the more times you get jabbed, the more likely you are to be infected against something that is sort of peripheral to the jab.
[02:11:25.038 --> 02:11:27.460]  So these jabs are based on the original wild-type
[02:11:27.984 --> 02:11:28.825]  Thank you!
[02:11:45.825 --> 02:11:52.792]  And now your immune system is going to take over in terms of fighting that virus.
[02:11:52.792 --> 02:11:57.977]  But your immune system has now been compromised every time you get the jab.
[02:11:57.977 --> 02:12:01.660]  And so it means that you're going to be less able to fight it off.
[02:12:01.660 --> 02:12:05.044]  That's why we're seeing negative vaccine efficacy.
[02:12:05.044 --> 02:12:06.085]  But that's part of it.
[02:12:06.085 --> 02:12:07.006]  You know, there could be
[02:12:08.287 --> 02:12:19.876]  This vaccine could be original antigenic sin, which says that we train the body to look for one thing, and if it looks for something else, then it's going to be harder for it to recognize that.
[02:12:19.876 --> 02:12:22.658]  So there's some of that going on.
[02:12:22.658 --> 02:12:23.879]  People talked about ADE.
[02:12:23.879 --> 02:12:35.508]  There probably isn't classical ADE, but there is basically a vaccine-induced effect where it's depressing your ability to fight
[02:12:36.730 --> 02:12:37.371]  Uh, the virus.
[02:12:37.371 --> 02:12:42.338]  So the point is that people may say, Oh, I'm going to be protected against COVID.
[02:12:42.338 --> 02:12:46.685]  But the problem is that you're gonna be protected more against the original strain.
[02:12:47.510 --> 02:12:50.693]  And it's going to depress your immune system for everything else.
[02:12:50.693 --> 02:12:55.858]  So like cancers are going to reoccur, latent viruses are going to reoccur.
[02:12:55.858 --> 02:13:03.625]  You know, people whose cancers were under control, they take the vaccine and it suddenly becomes completely out of control.
[02:13:03.625 --> 02:13:07.429]  And so this is something that we're seeing over and over again.
[02:13:07.429 --> 02:13:10.471]  I saw that German study at a hospital where they found the patients
[02:13:11.172 --> 02:13:11.413]  Oh yeah.
[02:13:22.888 --> 02:13:31.273]  It's an extremely dangerous vaccine and the CDC is basically just looking the other way for all of the safety effects.
[02:13:31.273 --> 02:13:40.198]  You know, just like the CDC 20 years ago with thimerosal in the vaccines, they studied it, they had a secret meeting.
[02:13:43.447 --> 02:13:43.767]  Thank you.
[02:14:02.583 --> 02:14:09.028]  It disappears from your bloodstream, but it goes into your brain, and it stays there for the rest of your life.
[02:14:09.028 --> 02:14:11.409]  And let's expand on that, because you're a great historian.
[02:14:11.409 --> 02:14:22.638]  That was 2000, ABC News, back when they did their job sometimes, reported on the secret documents that the head of the FDA even said in the minutes, my God, they'll kill us if they learn this.
[02:14:22.638 --> 02:14:25.640]  You know, we've got to take this out, but we've also got to suppress this.
[02:14:25.640 --> 02:14:27.121]  So I mean, it's all there, they know.
[02:14:28.180 --> 02:14:36.445]  Yeah, and in particular, they knew that the mercury went to your brain and sat in your brain.
[02:14:36.445 --> 02:14:43.289]  People thought it disappeared from your blood and was just excreted out your kidneys and so forth, but it didn't.
[02:14:43.289 --> 02:14:52.555]  It was taken out of your blood, but it went into your brain, and there was a 2005 study about this, and I read about this on my Substack, about why RFK Jr.
[02:14:53.542 --> 02:14:56.944]  Um, became, um, uh, against the vaccines.
[02:14:56.944 --> 02:15:03.407]  It's because he was, he talked to Paul Offit about it and Offit tried to pull the wool over his eyes about what was going on.
[02:15:03.407 --> 02:15:09.189]  And, um, uh, Bobby Kennedy knew about the study that showed that it went to the brain.
[02:15:09.189 --> 02:15:11.630]  And so he said, well, what about this study?
[02:15:11.630 --> 02:15:14.552]  And Paul Offit was silent at that point.
[02:15:14.552 --> 02:15:17.333]  And then he said, well, there are other studies that disprove that.
[02:15:17.333 --> 02:15:19.914]  And, and Kennedy said, send me the studies.
[02:15:20.712 --> 02:15:21.834]  And he never did.
[02:15:21.834 --> 02:15:26.580]  And that was the thing that triggered Bobby Kennedy to say, the system is corrupt.
[02:15:27.094 --> 02:15:29.436]  And boy, I bet they wish they never triggered him.
[02:15:29.436 --> 02:15:34.260]  He is a major world leader now, with millions coming to see him around the world when he speaks.
[02:15:34.260 --> 02:15:35.861]  We'll be right back with Steve Kirsch.
[02:15:35.861 --> 02:15:40.265]  You can find him on Substack at stevekirsch.substack.com.
[02:15:40.265 --> 02:15:41.546]  Life-saving info.
[02:15:41.546 --> 02:15:43.868]  Folks, we know the bad guys are bad.
[02:15:43.868 --> 02:15:45.770]  It's on us to get this out.
[02:15:45.770 --> 02:15:51.955]  Go to Substack, get the articles, go to InfoWars, get them out right now, and we will bring these tyrants to justice.
[02:15:51.955 --> 02:15:53.276]  They're coming after our children now.
[02:15:53.276 --> 02:15:54.117]  We have no choice.
[02:15:58.024 --> 02:16:07.786]  Since the end of World War Two, the globalists have been building their private corporate world government whose endgame once they get control is forced depopulation of the planet.
[02:16:07.786 --> 02:16:18.549]  That's why as we begin to leave the year 2021 and go into 2022, I am encouraging all of you out there watching and listening to count the cost and to realize how much danger you and your family are in.
[02:16:18.549 --> 02:16:20.670]  The globalists are coming after everybody.
[02:16:20.670 --> 02:16:22.150]  They are setting up a dystopic
[02:16:22.490 --> 02:16:23.010]  We're good.
[02:16:44.497 --> 02:16:50.186]  That infowarrestore.com is one of the most important places you can go to buy great products and fund the tip of the spear.
[02:16:50.186 --> 02:16:51.348]  I will go down with the chef.
[02:16:51.348 --> 02:16:52.369]  I'm not going to back down.
[02:16:52.369 --> 02:16:57.738]  I'm getting even more hardcore in their face, but I can't stay in the fight at 100% unless you support us, so please go to infowarrestore.com.
[02:16:59.797 --> 02:17:03.818]  I want to explain something that is absolutely key to understanding our world.
[02:17:03.818 --> 02:17:06.739]  It's very, very simple, but the most people don't know.
[02:17:06.739 --> 02:17:20.703]  The privately owned central banks of the world are artificially creating thousands of trillions of dollars in other major currencies and using them to buy up infrastructure, intellectual property,
[02:17:21.803 --> 02:17:37.071]  Energy, they're using it to buy people, to buy influence, and in the past they created thousands of trillions so that they could leverage that, manipulate markets, but they never allowed that money to get into the general circulation or it would cause massive inflation.
[02:17:37.071 --> 02:17:42.874]  Now they've gone ahead and weaponized it and are flooding every sector of the world economy, buying up everything.
[02:17:43.494 --> 02:17:52.745]  Not to have the companies operate, but to actually shut them down and force a collapse of civilization, making the companies they do fund be the only things left standing.
[02:17:52.745 --> 02:17:54.027]  This is the Great Reset.
[02:17:54.027 --> 02:17:55.609]  This is what's happening now.
[02:17:55.609 --> 02:17:56.309]  Warn everyone.
[02:17:56.309 --> 02:17:57.311]  It's the only way to stop it.
[02:18:00.123 --> 02:18:01.784]  This is a great sponsor.
[02:18:01.784 --> 02:18:07.268]  We have one of the best deals you're going to find out there on a high-quality, high-rated satellite phone.
[02:18:07.268 --> 02:18:11.871]  You can't be tracked, you can't be traced, and it'll work anywhere in the world where you can see the sky.
[02:18:11.871 --> 02:18:16.234]  You can also buy cheap antennas and things for in your car, in your house, that also are on the site.
[02:18:16.234 --> 02:18:18.135]  Infowarsphone.com.
[02:18:18.135 --> 02:18:19.636]  That's just a site that takes you to these folks.
[02:18:19.636 --> 02:18:22.518]  They supply the border patrol, everybody, with their systems as well.
[02:18:22.518 --> 02:18:24.740]  They're amazing folks, and you get a free phone at $650 value at
[02:18:26.781 --> 02:18:30.684]  Absolutely free at InfoWarsPhone.com.
[02:18:30.684 --> 02:18:32.865]  Smartphones are always tracking everything you do.
[02:18:32.865 --> 02:18:33.325]  These aren't.
[02:18:33.325 --> 02:18:35.307]  And the calls are free when folks call you.
[02:18:35.307 --> 02:18:39.169]  You just pay $99.95 a month for your minutes.
[02:18:39.169 --> 02:18:40.090]  150 minutes.
[02:18:40.090 --> 02:18:41.271]  So the calls here are free.
[02:18:41.271 --> 02:18:42.432]  Works like a regular cell phone.
[02:18:42.432 --> 02:18:43.732]  You're not being tracked or traced.
[02:18:43.732 --> 02:18:45.033]  And I keep one in my car.
[02:18:45.033 --> 02:18:46.874]  I've given them to my parents as gifts.
[02:18:46.874 --> 02:18:49.276]  Way out in the middle of nowhere where regular phones don't work, they work.
[02:18:49.276 --> 02:18:50.997]  InfoWarsPhone.com or 941-955-1020.
[02:18:50.997 --> 02:18:51.057]  941-955-1020.
[02:18:51.057 --> 02:18:51.998]  And ask the Alex Jones Special.
[02:18:58.042 --> 02:19:14.292]  In late August, InfoWars saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands that the globalists are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic and financial collapse worldwide.
[02:19:14.292 --> 02:19:17.934]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been something that's important to have.
[02:19:17.934 --> 02:19:24.639]  It's a checkbox that everybody needs to have taken care of, right along with water filtration, self-defense, and a relationship with God.
[02:19:25.259 --> 02:19:29.341]  But now more than ever, you need to get your storable food orders in now.
[02:19:29.341 --> 02:19:32.083]  We're ready to ship to you within 24 hours of your order.
[02:19:32.083 --> 02:19:32.903]  It's high quality.
[02:19:32.903 --> 02:19:36.105]  It's very, very low cost at infowarestore.com.
[02:19:36.105 --> 02:19:43.469]  Because in the future, you're going to see more food supply shortages and you're going to see food supply price increases that are already taking place.
[02:19:43.469 --> 02:19:47.391]  So lock in your storable food now at a lower price and fund the info war.
[02:19:47.711 --> 02:19:48.392]  We're good to go.
[02:20:13.284 --> 02:20:17.254]  We're good to go.
[02:20:33.592 --> 02:20:41.958]  Investigative journalist, very well-known top tech inventor and CEO, Steve Kirsch of Substack joins us.
[02:20:41.958 --> 02:20:44.540]  All right, Doc, let's get into it.
[02:20:44.540 --> 02:20:49.184]  In fact, guys, I just had another printout dealing with a study he did with a bunch of doctors.
[02:20:49.184 --> 02:20:51.146]  And I guess I left that in my office.
[02:20:51.146 --> 02:20:52.266]  If somebody will go and grab that.
[02:20:52.266 --> 02:20:55.809]  I was just reading it during the break, laid it down, forgot to bring it in here.
[02:20:55.809 --> 02:20:57.971]  Let's get into this big report you put out.
[02:20:58.911 --> 02:21:05.776]  Pathology results show 93% of people who died after being vaccinated were killed by the vaccine.
[02:21:05.776 --> 02:21:07.197]  Pretty incredible stuff.
[02:21:07.197 --> 02:21:08.919]  I spent hours researching it.
[02:21:08.919 --> 02:21:09.779]  It's all documented.
[02:21:09.779 --> 02:21:12.261]  Tell us what's happening.
[02:21:12.261 --> 02:21:18.486]  Well, I got an email saying, hey, this is the most devastating.
[02:21:20.189 --> 02:21:27.051]  This is the most devastating 15 minutes video that I've ever seen, and so I looked into it.
[02:21:27.051 --> 02:21:41.296]  That was from Mike Yaden, who used to work at Pfizer, and so I took a look at it, and indeed it was shocking, but I wanted to make sure that I checked it out with a pathologist before I
[02:21:43.018 --> 02:21:43.678]  I wrote about it.
[02:21:43.678 --> 02:21:45.620]  So I talked to Ryan Cole.
[02:21:45.620 --> 02:21:50.184]  Dr. Michael Yeadon, former chief scientist over vaccines at Pfizer.
[02:21:50.184 --> 02:21:51.325]  He sends you a video.
[02:21:51.325 --> 02:21:52.586]  You research it.
[02:21:52.586 --> 02:21:53.626]  That's where this comes from.
[02:21:53.626 --> 02:21:55.488]  Please continue.
[02:21:55.488 --> 02:21:56.028]  Yeah.
[02:21:56.028 --> 02:21:58.710]  So he said that this is the most devastating thing he's ever seen.
[02:21:58.710 --> 02:22:10.340]  And so I checked with Ryan Cole and I waited for him to confirm this report before I even wrote about it because I wanted to make sure that because I'm not a pathologist.
[02:22:11.188 --> 02:22:16.971]  So, I wanted to make sure that a trained pathologist would say, yeah, this is concerning.
[02:22:16.971 --> 02:22:37.823]  And indeed, it was concerning and it verifies results that we've seen from, there was this Gundry abstract that was, you know, fact-checked and people didn't like it, but it confirmed what was in the Gundry abstract, which said that the risk of heart disease doubles
[02:22:38.756 --> 02:22:41.096]  More than doubles after these vaccines.
[02:22:41.096 --> 02:22:49.038]  So the reports in the Gundry abstract were confirmed by this report.
[02:22:49.038 --> 02:22:53.299]  So everything that we saw here seems to make a lot of sense.
[02:22:53.299 --> 02:22:59.120]  So these were basically 15 patients who died after being vaccinated.
[02:22:59.120 --> 02:23:05.981]  And sometimes it happened seven days after being vaccinated, and sometimes they died within six months.
[02:23:06.431 --> 02:23:08.272]  So they had a mix of patients.
[02:23:08.272 --> 02:23:17.059]  Some of these people, the youngest I think was like 23, 24 year old and the oldest was I think like a 95 year old.
[02:23:17.059 --> 02:23:33.953]  But the one thing they had in common is that they were vaccinated six months or earlier before they were given to these scientists to do a very thorough autopsy and they spent six months to do the autopsy and what they found
[02:23:34.508 --> 02:23:48.677]  was that in 14 out of the 15 cases, in other words, 93%, that the vaccine was actually causing the T cells to attack your own organs.
[02:23:48.677 --> 02:23:53.140]  And in 14 out of the 15 cases, it attacked the heart.
[02:23:53.140 --> 02:23:57.763]  And so, depending on which organ they looked at, they would have fewer cases.
[02:23:57.763 --> 02:24:03.327]  But the organ that was most attacked, most often attacked in all the cases where they saw
[02:24:03.820 --> 02:24:05.041]  I think it's a good question.
[02:24:05.041 --> 02:24:06.462]  I think it's a good question.
[02:24:32.899 --> 02:24:49.975]  And when they actually examined the bodies correctly, using the right tests, with the right experience, and knowing what to look for, they found that in 93% of the cases, we can implicate that the vaccine was implicated in the death.
[02:24:54.480 --> 02:25:04.632]  And that doesn't mean the vaccine was the primary cause of the death, but the vaccine was most certainly a factor in the death of these people.
[02:25:05.259 --> 02:25:19.004]  Well, and of course we had six months ago the head of the German pathology union saying we're seeing massive increases in heart attacks and cancer and we just see similar numbers out of the UK that vaccinated are twice as likely to die.
[02:25:19.004 --> 02:25:24.106]  I mean, I see these headlines and we're sitting there watching this happen.
[02:25:24.106 --> 02:25:28.147]  This is just, this is crazy to be living through something this historical.
[02:25:29.358 --> 02:25:29.618]  Oh, yeah.
[02:25:29.618 --> 02:25:34.900]  And we're, you know, we're seeing personalities die in front of us.
[02:25:34.900 --> 02:25:43.084]  And, you know, there was a New York Times editor that died and they didn't even say anything about the vaccine.
[02:25:43.084 --> 02:25:47.405]  And yet he died one day after he got the vaccine.
[02:25:47.405 --> 02:25:56.189]  And the New York Times didn't even mention it in their story about an editor of the New York Times who dies.
[02:25:56.189 --> 02:25:58.370]  He just dies mysteriously at a young age.
[02:25:59.151 --> 02:26:05.996]  And they don't even talk about the fact that he was vaccinated the day before he died.
[02:26:05.996 --> 02:26:11.761]  The New York Times is basically covering up the death of their own editor.
[02:26:11.761 --> 02:26:17.626]  It's incredible.
[02:26:17.626 --> 02:26:18.046]  Yeah.
[02:26:18.046 --> 02:26:26.993]  You know, and the other thing I found that was really troubling to me and wasn't surprising is the ridiculously high rates of myocarditis.
[02:26:27.475 --> 02:26:41.300]  So I wrote an article about a private school where there is a 1 in 95 boys at the school were diagnosed with myocarditis.
[02:26:41.300 --> 02:26:50.883]  So, you know, a rate of 1 in 100 is a lot more than what the CDC says, which is, you know, they say it's like 1 in 12,000.
[02:26:50.883 --> 02:26:53.884]  So they're off by a factor of I think more than 100.
[02:26:54.972 --> 02:26:55.172]  Thank you.
[02:27:09.063 --> 02:27:12.906]  Patients that he has and these were adults.
[02:27:12.906 --> 02:27:17.149]  These were people from 20 to 50 year old people.
[02:27:17.149 --> 02:27:22.953]  He's never seen pericarditis in people before and he's been in practice for 29 years.
[02:27:22.953 --> 02:27:30.438]  He's never seen any cases at all in that age group and now all of a sudden he's got four this year.
[02:27:32.589 --> 02:27:36.290]  The coincidence is that they all happen within two weeks of vaccination.
[02:27:36.290 --> 02:27:37.131]  Well, exactly.
[02:27:37.131 --> 02:27:46.414]  And we noticed the FDA seemed to know this a year ago, where they don't count what the first two weeks, they don't count somebody that dies in the first two weeks is vaccinated, even though they took the shot.
[02:27:46.414 --> 02:27:46.614]  Right.
[02:27:47.225 --> 02:27:50.586]  Yeah, you know, and all this stuff is being ignored.
[02:27:50.586 --> 02:27:55.988]  Mandy DeGray, that people know about, that was fraud in the Pfizer clinical trial.
[02:27:55.988 --> 02:27:58.029]  The FDA promised me they would investigate.
[02:27:58.029 --> 02:27:59.989]  They did nothing.
[02:27:59.989 --> 02:28:06.191]  You know, they still make it appear that the vaccines can't cause paralysis, when in fact they can.
[02:28:06.191 --> 02:28:11.873]  And it was one in a thousand kids that was paralyzed in this trial, at least, or could be more than that.
[02:28:11.873 --> 02:28:13.634]  We're going to break in a moment.
[02:28:13.634 --> 02:28:16.435]  I've got a lot of questions, but what are you about to hit, Steve, when we come back?
[02:28:18.693 --> 02:28:24.261]  I've got a thousand things to ask you.
[02:28:24.261 --> 02:28:26.384]  I'm just saying, what do you want to hit next when we come back?
[02:28:27.467 --> 02:28:32.369]  Oh, you know, we can talk about the 10,000 dead in South Korea after the vaccine.
[02:28:32.369 --> 02:28:37.111]  We can talk about theirs and what's going on in theirs.
[02:28:37.111 --> 02:28:41.973]  We'll talk about the book on Fauci that Bobby Kennedy wrote.
[02:28:41.973 --> 02:28:43.774]  Oh my gosh, that thing is everywhere.
[02:28:43.774 --> 02:28:44.714]  Absolutely, stay there.
[02:28:44.714 --> 02:28:46.695]  Because I don't see how they get out of this.
[02:28:46.695 --> 02:28:48.616]  That's another question I'm going to ask you first.
[02:28:48.616 --> 02:28:51.337]  How do these crazy people that did this get out of this?
[02:28:51.337 --> 02:28:53.838]  I mean, wow, this is biblical.
[02:28:53.838 --> 02:28:54.398]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:57.381 --> 02:29:02.903]  I'm cutting this announcement on the morning of December 28th, 2021.

[02:29:27.088 --> 02:29:31.249]  Ultimate Bone Broth that we finally got reformulated and back in stock.
[02:29:31.249 --> 02:29:38.770]  It is going to be ending its sale along with more than 50 other products at InfoWarsTore.com and the free shipping.

[02:29:45.451 --> 02:29:49.532]  We were going to run them through to the new year, but most of these products have almost sold out.
[02:29:49.532 --> 02:29:50.712]  A lot have already sold out.
[02:29:50.712 --> 02:29:51.892]  So thanks for keeping us on the air.
[02:29:51.892 --> 02:29:52.913]  These are great products.

[02:30:00.087 --> 02:30:14.056]  It's time to come to grips with the fact that even though you don't have anything to hide, criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech, government are stealing all of your data and creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do.
[02:30:14.056 --> 02:30:18.499]  So in the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down.
[02:30:18.499 --> 02:30:26.885]  Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts, protecting your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount.

[02:30:51.632 --> 02:30:52.192]  It's amazing.
[02:30:56.789 --> 02:31:00.192]  Not just across the United States, but across the world.
[02:31:00.192 --> 02:31:05.637]  You see it on the sides of barns, and on bumper stickers on cars, and written on the side of bathroom walls.
[02:31:05.637 --> 02:31:07.219]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:31:07.219 --> 02:31:16.167]  That's become a maxim of people to communicate to others that they see through the fraud of the New World Order, that they're saying no to Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, and the Great Reset.
[02:31:16.167 --> 02:31:19.550]  And so now, Infowars credibility is stronger than it's ever been.
[02:31:20.171 --> 02:31:25.636]  And the globalists are now coming to try to shut us down after all their other attacks, and we can't let them do that.
[02:31:25.636 --> 02:31:28.338]  So, you've invested in Infowars over the years.
[02:31:28.338 --> 02:31:34.844]  I'm asking you to redouble those efforts now at this critical juncture, or everything you've done in the past is for nothing.
[02:31:35.464 --> 02:31:39.288]  You have invested in justice and the truth and hardcore populism.
[02:31:39.288 --> 02:31:41.510]  You have done incredible things.
[02:31:41.510 --> 02:31:49.157]  And I'm telling you now, going into 2022, InfoWars has major underages to run our operation and we need more funds in.
[02:31:49.157 --> 02:31:50.178]  So it's a 360 win.
[02:31:50.178 --> 02:31:53.881]  Get great products that are great for you and your family, your immune system, and so much more.
[02:31:53.881 --> 02:31:55.163]  So please go to InfoWars4.com.
[02:31:56.750 --> 02:32:09.911]  The average person on the face of this incredible planet is still unaware that there's a war between free individuals and nation-states on one side, and the globalists on the other, who are literally trying to create a post-human world.
[02:32:10.646 --> 02:32:18.408]  For the United States of Brazil, and of course triggered by the Brexit in the UK, nations were pulling out of the private, corporate, and fascist world government.
[02:32:18.408 --> 02:32:25.651]  That's why they launched their Great Reset, and their program after collapsing us, of Build Back Better.
[02:32:25.651 --> 02:32:30.852]  This is nothing more than a top-down, vertical consolidation of the world economy.
[02:32:30.852 --> 02:32:35.014]  And because they couldn't take our guns, and because we wouldn't bow, because the left
[02:32:35.774 --> 02:32:39.478]  Which is the ideology of this world government system couldn't win.
[02:32:39.478 --> 02:32:42.481]  They released a biological weapon on us.
[02:32:42.481 --> 02:32:44.483]  Now we know, two years ago.
[02:32:44.483 --> 02:32:46.826]  We learned about it about 20 months ago.
[02:32:46.826 --> 02:32:47.406]  It's that simple.
[02:32:47.406 --> 02:32:50.530]  They can't beat us because of our free speech and our guns.
[02:32:50.530 --> 02:32:54.694]  So the Global Corporate Combine released COVID-19 and you know the rest is history.
[02:32:54.694 --> 02:32:56.156]  Expose this paradigm and we win.
[02:32:59.542 --> 02:33:04.164]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:33:04.164 --> 02:33:14.027]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:14.027 --> 02:33:15.208]  You want answers?
[02:33:15.208 --> 02:33:16.348]  Big Brother.
[02:33:16.348 --> 02:33:18.169]  Mainstream media.
[02:33:18.169 --> 02:33:20.030]  Government cover-ups.
[02:33:20.030 --> 02:33:21.730]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:33:21.730 --> 02:33:23.411]  Well, so does he.
[02:33:23.411 --> 02:33:27.552]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:30.930 --> 02:33:34.513]  Well, we're living in a dystopic nightmare.
[02:33:34.513 --> 02:33:36.234]  But we're also living in incredible times.
[02:33:36.234 --> 02:33:43.480]  There's so many good people awake right now, and these are the times that don't just try men and women's souls, but really define who we are.
[02:33:44.409 --> 02:34:03.081]  Steve Kirsch, again, famous internet computer software engineer, MIT engineer, tech company founder, billions in market cap, but best known now for his great fight against tyranny and exposing this mass medical malpractice that the system's launched.
[02:34:03.081 --> 02:34:09.805]  I want to get into the other big articles you've been breaking and some of the big developments, but just as an American, as a human,
[02:34:10.905 --> 02:34:13.748]  What do you think the power structure and big pharma is thinking?
[02:34:13.748 --> 02:34:17.130]  Because everybody I know is turning against it now.
[02:34:17.130 --> 02:34:20.253]  You know, before it was kind of like, well, they were hurting people, but some still bought it.
[02:34:20.253 --> 02:34:23.096]  But now five, six shots, nothing's enough.
[02:34:23.096 --> 02:34:24.317]  Oh, we need more lockdowns.
[02:34:24.317 --> 02:34:27.359]  And then suddenly Biden starts to back off.
[02:34:27.359 --> 02:34:29.841]  What do you think's really going on?
[02:34:29.841 --> 02:34:36.367]  Well, I think the best salesman for all of this is the vaccine itself.
[02:34:37.239 --> 02:34:40.201]  Because the healthcare professionals know what's going on.
[02:34:40.201 --> 02:34:44.123]  I've got a group now, I've got a separate sub-stack of healthcare professionals.
[02:34:44.123 --> 02:34:47.044]  So we've got over a thousand healthcare professionals on that.
[02:34:47.044 --> 02:34:49.806]  So it's doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and so forth.
[02:34:49.806 --> 02:34:50.807]  They know what's going on.
[02:34:52.716 --> 02:34:57.718]  But, and so I asked them, well, how many of your peers actually know what's going on?
[02:34:57.718 --> 02:34:59.499]  And it's kind of this exponential curve.
[02:34:59.499 --> 02:35:06.062]  It's like, yeah, most of it is like, most people say about 10% know what's going on.
[02:35:06.062 --> 02:35:06.882]  The next fraction is 20%.
[02:35:06.882 --> 02:35:09.703]  The next fraction is 30%.
[02:35:09.703 --> 02:35:19.547]  But I've seen answers as high as 60% of the medical professionals actually are clued in to what is going on, but they can't speak out.
[02:35:20.208 --> 02:35:25.850]  Because if they speak out, what will happen is they'll try to take away their license to practice medicine.
[02:35:25.850 --> 02:35:30.831]  And many of these people are the top breadwinner in their family.
[02:35:30.831 --> 02:35:34.632]  And their first duty is not to their patients, it's to their family.
[02:35:34.632 --> 02:35:36.933]  And so they can't risk speaking out.
[02:35:36.933 --> 02:35:42.795]  But now that we're getting large numbers of these people, they're no longer afraid to speak out.
[02:35:42.795 --> 02:35:45.075]  And so we're seeing nurses that are speaking out.
[02:35:45.075 --> 02:35:46.756]  You're saying we're approaching critical mass?
[02:35:47.478 --> 02:35:52.083]  We're approaching critical mass and we're also gathering some data.
[02:35:52.083 --> 02:35:57.669]  I'm working with some health care professionals to gather some data that will be devastating for people.
[02:35:57.669 --> 02:36:08.762]  There's a university that I'm funding the study on that's going to look at what the true rate of serious adverse events is.
[02:36:09.167 --> 02:36:14.852]  In a way that cannot be attacked by the medical community or by anybody else.
[02:36:14.852 --> 02:36:18.374]  And so this will be from a top university and this will be unassailable.
[02:36:18.374 --> 02:36:20.576]  So we're making steps now.
[02:36:20.576 --> 02:36:24.459]  And of course the CDC should have done this study a year ago.
[02:36:24.459 --> 02:36:25.120]  But they haven't.
[02:36:25.120 --> 02:36:29.483]  So we're kicking that off.
[02:36:29.483 --> 02:36:30.304]  It's fully funded.
[02:36:30.991 --> 02:36:31.251]  I think?
[02:36:51.192 --> 02:36:57.815]  You know, anyone can report, which is not true because the reports are all screened by the Health and Human Services.
[02:36:57.815 --> 02:37:00.096]  So we can get around having these debates.
[02:37:00.096 --> 02:37:10.961]  And by the way, we can't have, we still, you know, Peter McCullough went on Joe Rogan and said that I was offering a $2 million to anyone who would even come and debate me.
[02:37:11.587 --> 02:37:13.450]  Well, so that wasn't quite true.
[02:37:13.450 --> 02:37:21.742]  I only offered a million dollars, and it was only to those people who are on the outside committees of the CDC and the FDA.
[02:37:21.742 --> 02:37:26.168]  I offered them a million dollars, and if one person showed up, they'd keep the whole million, and if two people showed up, it's 500.
[02:37:27.929 --> 02:37:30.591]  And if four people showed up, it's 250k each.
[02:37:30.591 --> 02:37:36.093]  None of them wanted to have a discussion with me so I can ask them questions and interview them.
[02:37:36.093 --> 02:37:38.074]  So not for a million dollars.
[02:37:38.074 --> 02:37:40.275]  They wouldn't do it for a million dollars.
[02:37:40.275 --> 02:37:45.357]  They would not let me ask them some questions for a million dollars.
[02:37:45.357 --> 02:37:45.777]  Which is incredible.
[02:37:45.777 --> 02:37:46.658]  Steve Kersh, stay right there.
[02:37:46.658 --> 02:37:51.140]  But since you talk about Dr. Peter McCullough, we are very honored.
[02:37:51.140 --> 02:37:54.421]  In fact, I think I'm just going to let him host the show Friday.
[02:37:54.421 --> 02:37:55.922]  He's going to be here in studio.
[02:37:56.969 --> 02:37:58.589]  Friday, took co-host for three hours.
[02:37:58.589 --> 02:38:02.630]  I think I'm just going to let him take over and do a whole PowerPoint, a whole deal.
[02:38:02.630 --> 02:38:04.131]  But absolutely.
[02:38:04.131 --> 02:38:05.611]  And so you knew about it beforehand.
[02:38:05.611 --> 02:38:06.371]  I knew about it beforehand.
[02:38:06.371 --> 02:38:08.132]  We weren't supposed to say anything.
[02:38:08.132 --> 02:38:13.293]  But Dr. Robert Malone, because of what's happening, is on a plane right now to Austin.
[02:38:13.293 --> 02:38:14.633]  He'll tape with Joe Rogan tomorrow.
[02:38:14.633 --> 02:38:16.534]  He should be out tomorrow night or the next day.
[02:38:16.534 --> 02:38:21.055]  So their attempts to censor him, we can now talk about it, it's now public, are not going to work.
[02:38:21.055 --> 02:38:21.935]  So very, very exciting.
[02:38:23.909 --> 02:38:34.474]  Uh, yeah, we're, we're very excited that, you know, it's, it's a, you know, kind of like when one door closes, when he gets removed from Twitter, another door opens, which is, um, uh, that he's going to be on Rogan.
[02:38:34.474 --> 02:38:39.917]  And, and, and the people that I work with were instrumental in, in making that, uh, that happen.
[02:38:39.917 --> 02:38:46.020]  Malone's appearance on, um, on Joe Rogan will be extraordinary.
[02:38:46.020 --> 02:38:51.603]  And, um, if we can get Robert F. Kennedy on, on Rogan, I think that'll bring the house down.
[02:38:52.771 --> 02:38:53.292]  I totally agree.
[02:38:53.292 --> 02:38:54.194]  Let's talk about Kennedy.
[02:38:54.194 --> 02:38:57.802]  We'll go to break in five minutes and come back into all the other big news you mentioned.
[02:38:57.802 --> 02:38:59.225]  But what, what a leader.
[02:38:59.225 --> 02:39:00.367]  He's not trying to be a leader.
[02:39:01.303 --> 02:39:02.663]  I'd love him to be president.
[02:39:02.663 --> 02:39:06.224]  I mean, he has just been steadfastly for over a decade fighting this.
[02:39:06.224 --> 02:39:10.345]  And now he goes to Germany, two million people, the UK, a million people.
[02:39:10.345 --> 02:39:13.786]  I mean, I mean, he's here in the U.S., hundreds of thousands come out.
[02:39:13.786 --> 02:39:15.347]  That is truly a public servant.
[02:39:15.347 --> 02:39:17.007]  And he's been vindicated.
[02:39:17.007 --> 02:39:17.767]  He's been censored.
[02:39:17.767 --> 02:39:18.808]  He's been attacked.
[02:39:18.808 --> 02:39:20.728]  He's got to scare the hell out of people.
[02:39:20.728 --> 02:39:22.949]  That's that's RFK's son.
[02:39:22.949 --> 02:39:27.910]  And he is certainly living up, I'd say, past the father.
[02:39:27.910 --> 02:39:28.470]  Oh, yeah.
[02:39:28.470 --> 02:39:30.191]  You know, and he was attacked.
[02:39:31.662 --> 02:39:36.103]  On CNN.
[02:39:36.103 --> 02:39:42.925]  And he offered to say, hey, instead of slinging a tax, let's debate.
[02:39:42.925 --> 02:39:45.846]  And he was turned down.
[02:39:45.846 --> 02:39:50.948]  He said, I'm not going to debate you.
[02:39:50.948 --> 02:39:53.209]  Yeah, this is his offer.
[02:39:53.209 --> 02:39:56.229]  Well, I mean, they can't debate him.
[02:39:56.229 --> 02:39:59.771]  No, they can't, because they don't have the facts.
[02:39:59.771 --> 02:40:01.031]  And Kennedy has the facts.
[02:40:01.883 --> 02:40:02.963]  And they know it.
[02:40:02.963 --> 02:40:10.426]  And this is why you won't see a debate between any CNN correspondent and Robert F. Kennedy, because Kennedy knows what he's talking about.
[02:40:10.426 --> 02:40:12.107]  He's got the facts to back it up.
[02:40:12.107 --> 02:40:14.087]  And everything is verifiable.
[02:40:14.087 --> 02:40:15.788]  So they're not going to debate him.
[02:40:15.788 --> 02:40:19.169]  They use the excuse to say, well, we don't want to give him a platform.
[02:40:20.114 --> 02:40:22.376]  And, but that's just an excuse.
[02:40:22.376 --> 02:40:24.297]  Oh, that's such an arrogant thing.
[02:40:24.297 --> 02:40:29.362]  With all their propaganda and all their billions, they've got 700,000 viewers on average an hour.
[02:40:29.362 --> 02:40:32.064]  Kennedy goes on nowhere, he gets 10 million views.
[02:40:32.064 --> 02:40:35.366]  The arrogance of, we're not going to give you a platform.
[02:40:35.366 --> 02:40:38.309]  We're just going to attack you because they're scared of him.
[02:40:38.309 --> 02:40:40.531]  But then say, we don't let you have a level playing field.
[02:40:40.531 --> 02:40:43.513]  We don't let you respond.
[02:40:43.513 --> 02:40:44.974]  Um, that's right.
[02:40:44.974 --> 02:40:45.915]  Because they can't.
[02:40:45.915 --> 02:40:49.558]  And, and Kennedy knew that Jake Tapper.
[02:40:50.279 --> 02:40:56.004]  Would never debate him because Jake just doesn't have the facts.
[02:40:56.004 --> 02:40:57.085]  He doesn't know.
[02:40:57.085 --> 02:41:01.048]  He doesn't know the material.
[02:41:01.048 --> 02:41:06.072]  So Jake Tapper is never going to accept a debate from Robert F. Kennedy.
[02:41:06.072 --> 02:41:09.936]  I talked to Kennedy at the time when he offered the debate with Jake Tapper.
[02:41:10.456 --> 02:41:13.157]  And he said, you know, Jake's never going to debate me.
[02:41:13.157 --> 02:41:16.079]  You know, Jake used to be a good guy on ABC.
[02:41:16.079 --> 02:41:23.282]  He worked with Kennedy to do this expose about what happened at Simpsonwood.
[02:41:23.282 --> 02:41:29.885]  And the network, ABC network, pulled it at the last minute before it was going to be broadcast.
[02:41:29.885 --> 02:41:36.148]  And, you know, that like never happened before.
[02:41:36.148 --> 02:41:37.329]  Jake Tapper was pissed.
[02:41:38.050 --> 02:41:40.291]  And that was the last time.
[02:41:40.291 --> 02:41:45.254]  We'll come back in the final segment and all your other big news, but why can't we get Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[02:41:45.254 --> 02:41:46.655]  to run again?
[02:41:46.655 --> 02:41:49.917]  I mean, I guarantee you Republicans and Democrats would vote for him.
[02:41:49.917 --> 02:41:53.279]  He'd be the next president.
[02:41:53.279 --> 02:41:55.460]  I agree with you, Alex.
[02:41:55.460 --> 02:41:59.603]  But he has no intention, does he?
[02:41:59.603 --> 02:42:01.424]  Let's just say I can't talk about that, Alex.
[02:42:04.325 --> 02:42:07.116]  Oh boy, well he's what we need and I agree he needs to get on Rogan.
[02:42:07.116 --> 02:42:08.442]  I was asking Rogan last week.
[02:42:09.505 --> 02:42:10.266]  When is Kennedy on?
[02:42:10.266 --> 02:42:11.427]  He said, hopefully soon.
[02:42:11.427 --> 02:42:13.228]  But I mean, it should have happened a year ago.
[02:42:13.228 --> 02:42:14.730]  But right now is the zeitgeist.
[02:42:14.730 --> 02:42:16.491]  Right now is that magic time.
[02:42:16.491 --> 02:42:19.795]  We'll be right back with a final segment, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:42:19.795 --> 02:42:28.543]  And then after our special investigative journalist leaves us, we're going to hit some other breaking news in the next hour and have a special guest joining us as well.
[02:42:28.543 --> 02:42:35.189]  But be sure and go to stevekirsch.substack.com or stkirsch on Twitter, because the stuff he's got is groundbreaking.
[02:42:36.221 --> 02:42:41.243]  Okay, when we come back, he is going around and getting medical doctors to give him reports on what they're actually seeing.
[02:42:41.243 --> 02:42:42.324]  We'll look at those.
[02:42:42.324 --> 02:42:47.286]  We'll also look at some of the other reports he's got straight ahead.
[02:42:47.286 --> 02:42:50.667]  A 360-time increase in the rates of serious illnesses.
[02:42:50.667 --> 02:42:51.768]  We'll talk about it when we come back.
[02:42:57.654 --> 02:43:08.253]  Well, if InfoWars was battle-hardened and wounded and punished and tortured and demonized and lied about in the last 20-plus years, we've really gone through...
[02:43:09.352 --> 02:43:11.313]  The most destructive year we've ever seen.
[02:43:11.313 --> 02:43:13.574]  But so is the country, so is the world.
[02:43:13.574 --> 02:43:16.996]  And InfoWars intends to go into the thick of the fight.
[02:43:16.996 --> 02:43:18.496]  We intend to get attacked.
[02:43:18.496 --> 02:43:20.357]  We also intend to win.
[02:43:20.357 --> 02:43:22.698]  But we can't do that without working together.
[02:43:22.698 --> 02:43:29.962]  So I wanted to thank all of you in this insane year of 2021 for your support and for your promotion of liberty and freedom.
[02:43:30.402 --> 02:43:35.165]  And I want to encourage you all to understand that we're not backing down, and the Great Awakening is here.
[02:43:35.165 --> 02:43:36.806]  That's why the globalists are so scared.
[02:43:36.806 --> 02:43:47.991]  And I want to encourage you to take advantage of the best deals of the year that we were going to extend through the 1st, but we're selling out of basically everything, so we have to end the sales Thursday morning.
[02:43:47.991 --> 02:43:50.073]  So I'm cutting this on Tuesday morning.
[02:43:50.073 --> 02:43:56.276]  That means there's just two days left to get store-wide free shipping, double Patreon points, up to 60% off at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:43:58.010 --> 02:44:11.401]  If you're ruthless megacorporations who've taken over almost every government on earth and who are trying to destroy the middle class in any form of upward mobility, you've got to divide and conquer the public so they don't know they're being targeted.
[02:44:11.401 --> 02:44:19.367]  And that's why the Fortune 100 have wrapped themselves in the name of LBGT and African-American rights and all the rest of it all over the world.
[02:44:19.947 --> 02:44:32.444]  That's now their corporate face while they run slave camps in Africa and in Communist China and many other areas while they undermine our basic liberties here and spy on us through the big tech that the central banks and others own.
[02:44:32.444 --> 02:44:35.087]  So this is a criminal takeover and when you look at the new
[02:44:35.968 --> 02:44:37.269]  It's superclass.
[02:44:37.269 --> 02:44:38.410]  It's the politicians.
[02:44:38.410 --> 02:44:40.612]  It's the corporate media.
[02:44:40.612 --> 02:44:41.312]  It's the police.
[02:44:41.312 --> 02:44:42.193]  It's the bureaucrats.
[02:44:42.193 --> 02:44:44.655]  It's members of Congress and their staff and their families.
[02:44:44.655 --> 02:44:46.056]  It's the White House.
[02:44:46.056 --> 02:44:54.803]  Hell, it's postal workers who were all exempt from the poison shots, but not the general public and everybody else through corporate rule.
[02:44:54.803 --> 02:44:56.745]  So this is the true discrimination that's going on.
[02:44:57.944 --> 02:45:05.352]  Ultimate Bone Broth is back and better than ever and 20% off plus free shipping and double Patriot points for our new sale.
[02:45:05.352 --> 02:45:12.519]  After years of being off the shelves, we're bringing back one of the biggest fan favorite formulas ever and it's now been reformulated and is even stronger.
[02:45:12.519 --> 02:45:14.361]  It's Ultimate Bone Broth Plus.
[02:45:15.021 --> 02:45:24.247]  It's got concentrated high-quality chicken broth protein, turmeric root that's so amazing, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder.
[02:45:24.247 --> 02:45:27.689]  Then it's got added magnesium and potassium for electrolytes.
[02:45:27.689 --> 02:45:34.212]  It's got real organic cocoa bean powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of sea salt.
[02:45:34.212 --> 02:45:36.154]  It even tastes better than the last formula.
[02:45:36.154 --> 02:45:38.635]  And what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[02:45:38.635 --> 02:45:40.036]  Again, it has that cutting edge.
[02:45:40.496 --> 02:45:46.061]  Chicken broth, protein, isolate powder for better flavor and dissolvability.
[02:45:46.061 --> 02:45:50.225]  You're gonna love this and what it does for your joints, what it does for your body, what it does for your bones.
[02:45:50.225 --> 02:45:52.988]  It's simply amazing and it helps fund the InfoWar.
[02:45:52.988 --> 02:45:57.132]  This is really the best bone broth out there, so get yours at InfoWarStore.com today!
[02:45:57.617 --> 02:46:07.400]  Since the end of World War II, the globalists have been building their private corporate world government, whose endgame, once they get control, is forced depopulation of the planet.
[02:46:07.400 --> 02:46:18.164]  That's why as we begin to leave the year 2021 and go into 2022, I am encouraging all of you out there watching and listening to count the cost and to realize how much danger you and your family are in.
[02:46:18.164 --> 02:46:19.905]  The globalists are coming after everybody.
[02:46:20.265 --> 02:46:25.030]  They are setting up a dystopic, planetary, authoritarian technocracy.
[02:46:25.030 --> 02:46:27.493]  A dictatorship of the globalists.
[02:46:27.493 --> 02:46:29.916]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[02:46:29.916 --> 02:46:34.922]  Your investment in us over the years, buying our products, spreading the word, and praying for us has been incredible.
[02:46:34.922 --> 02:46:35.983]  But I'm telling you right now,
[02:46:36.263 --> 02:46:40.507]  We're about to lose not just InfoWars, but the entire country and the world to tyranny.
[02:46:40.507 --> 02:46:44.110]  So now, everything you've done in the past needs to be redoubled today.
[02:46:44.110 --> 02:46:49.814]  And InfoWarsTore.com is one of the most important places you can go to buy great products and fund the tip of the spear.
[02:46:49.814 --> 02:46:50.955]  I will go down with the ship.
[02:46:50.955 --> 02:46:51.976]  I'm not going to back down.
[02:46:51.976 --> 02:46:53.697]  I'm getting even more hardcore in their face.
[02:46:53.697 --> 02:46:56.180]  But I can't stay in the fight at 100% unless you support us.
[02:46:56.180 --> 02:46:58.982]  So please go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:46:58.982 --> 02:47:04.887]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:08.821 --> 02:47:13.362]  What is adenopathy?
[02:47:13.362 --> 02:47:14.323]  Adenopathy.
[02:47:14.323 --> 02:47:20.225]  360 times increase the rate of adenopathy after vaccination.
[02:47:35.609 --> 02:47:37.730]  That's what radiologists have noticed.
[02:47:37.730 --> 02:47:42.013]  And these reports are all the same, pouring out around the world.
[02:47:42.013 --> 02:47:43.354]  I wish it was a real vaccine.
[02:47:43.354 --> 02:47:44.595]  I wish it worked.
[02:47:44.595 --> 02:47:46.256]  I wish this wasn't happening.
[02:47:46.256 --> 02:47:47.597]  But it's not.
[02:47:47.597 --> 02:47:49.359]  And then you've got to ask yourself what's happening.
[02:47:49.359 --> 02:47:54.322]  Steve Kirsch, in the 10 minutes we've got left, thank you so much for spending time with us on this Wednesday edition.
[02:47:54.322 --> 02:47:56.464]  You've got a bunch of other big bombshell reports.
[02:47:56.464 --> 02:47:58.705]  Let's run through these, starting with this one.
[02:47:58.705 --> 02:47:59.726]  What is adenopathy?
[02:48:01.256 --> 02:48:04.818]  So, adenopathy is a swelling of your lymph nodes.
[02:48:04.818 --> 02:48:12.901]  So, typically it'll be under your armpit that you'll get a swelling or you can be on the top of your clavicle that there'll be a swelling.
[02:48:12.901 --> 02:48:22.326]  And so, this happens all the time, but what doesn't happen is where cases of the swelling that happens and it's unexplained.
[02:48:22.326 --> 02:48:26.688]  And so, normally a radiologist... So, adenopathy is the word to say it?
[02:48:26.688 --> 02:48:27.328]  Is it?
[02:48:27.328 --> 02:48:28.269]  No, I'm asking you.
[02:48:29.964 --> 02:48:31.104]  Oh, adenopathy.
[02:48:31.104 --> 02:48:31.564]  Adenopathy.
[02:48:31.564 --> 02:48:31.965]  Okay, good.
[02:48:31.965 --> 02:48:33.205]  I was reading it different ways.
[02:48:33.205 --> 02:48:34.685]  Okay, yeah, so I've read about that.
[02:48:34.685 --> 02:48:35.865]  That's just the swelling of the lymph nodes.
[02:48:35.865 --> 02:48:37.206]  Okay, keep going.
[02:48:37.206 --> 02:48:44.908]  Right, so it happens all the time, but what doesn't happen is when it's unexplained, where they can't find a cause for it.
[02:48:44.908 --> 02:48:54.590]  And so a radiologist will see that maybe once, this radiologist I talked to, sees it once every six months, and now she's seeing two or three a day.
[02:48:56.467 --> 02:49:01.951]  I just read the news, and I see articles everywhere about COVID vaxxers linked to swollen lymph nodes.
[02:49:01.951 --> 02:49:04.193]  I see that everywhere.
[02:49:04.193 --> 02:49:06.614]  Yeah, well, this is the reason.
[02:49:06.614 --> 02:49:12.219]  She's seeing this a lot, and she doesn't have an explanation for it.
[02:49:12.219 --> 02:49:18.023]  So these lymph nodes are then biopsied, but then it basically comes back as, you know,
[02:49:20.225 --> 02:49:21.866]  It's kind of come back as unspecified.
[02:49:21.866 --> 02:49:25.109]  So right now it's a mystery as to why it's happening.
[02:49:25.109 --> 02:49:29.513]  I've been trying to talk to some immunologists for a possible link to it.
[02:49:29.513 --> 02:49:37.120]  But it's just, you know, one of these unexplained events that's, you know, happening at 360 times the rate that it happened before.
[02:49:37.120 --> 02:49:39.042]  And it's all vaccine linked.
[02:49:39.042 --> 02:49:42.925]  You know, so these people have been vaccinated and they're having this.
[02:49:42.925 --> 02:49:45.107]  So that's the one thing in common.
[02:49:46.405 --> 02:49:48.708]  The other reports, you've got so many here.
[02:49:48.708 --> 02:49:52.473]  You have an article, How the Game is Really Played.
[02:49:52.473 --> 02:49:54.576]  You've got another dealing with all this.
[02:49:54.576 --> 02:49:58.561]  Over 10,000 vaccine deaths in South Korea shortly after vaccination.
[02:49:58.561 --> 02:49:59.362]  Let's start with that one.
[02:50:00.877 --> 02:50:16.922]  Um, yeah, let me just, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,
[02:50:17.635 --> 02:50:36.005]  Oh yeah, so this is a humorous piece that I wrote on a memo from Tony Fauci to world leaders to explain to them how we're going to win this and how we're going to protect the world and how we're going to keep the world from realizing these vaccines are really unsafe.
[02:50:36.005 --> 02:50:46.451]  And so it talks about 20 of the ground rules that they put in place to hide everything, including that, hey, we're going to require vaccination for everybody except for people at the CDC.
[02:50:47.311 --> 02:50:51.434]  And the NIH and the FDA, because we don't want them to leave.
[02:50:51.434 --> 02:51:01.360]  And, you know, I learned today, I talked to someone who, he doesn't work at the CDC, but half of his neighbors work at the CDC.
[02:51:01.360 --> 02:51:07.684]  And he said, all of them, none of them have vaccinated their kids with any of the vaccines.
[02:51:08.519 --> 02:51:10.983]  None of these people from the CDC.
[02:51:10.983 --> 02:51:12.124]  They're sort of clued in.
[02:51:12.124 --> 02:51:17.151]  It's kind of like the CDC saying, hey, do what we say, but not what we do.
[02:51:17.151 --> 02:51:19.314]  And so this was this was new news to me.
[02:51:19.314 --> 02:51:23.019]  I didn't realize that these CDC workers haven't vaccinated.
[02:51:24.960 --> 02:51:33.283]  Well, Steve, remember six, eight months ago, they had the head of the CDC and others in front of Congress, and they said, hey, we hear over half haven't taken.
[02:51:33.283 --> 02:51:35.044]  They said, yeah, we're not going to talk about it.
[02:51:35.044 --> 02:51:36.225]  So that backs up what you're saying.
[02:51:36.225 --> 02:51:39.266]  But yeah, when I read these things in your article, it's all true.
[02:51:39.266 --> 02:51:41.467]  Never allow a proper autopsy.
[02:51:41.467 --> 02:51:44.789]  Never allow anyone to do an analysis of what's in the vials.
[02:51:44.789 --> 02:51:46.109]  I mean, yeah, it's crazy.
[02:51:46.109 --> 02:51:48.810]  In fact, we should have done the whole show just on this.
[02:51:48.810 --> 02:51:49.171]  You're right.
[02:51:49.171 --> 02:51:49.871]  This is amazing.
[02:51:51.052 --> 02:51:53.215]  Yeah, it was fun to write.
[02:51:53.215 --> 02:51:54.616]  I wrote it last night.
[02:51:54.616 --> 02:52:04.788]  I just wanted to sort of accumulate kind of the techniques that they've used to control us, you know, and masks tops the list because everybody hates wearing masks.
[02:52:04.788 --> 02:52:08.893]  And you know, when there are only two randomized trials for mask wearing.
[02:52:09.423 --> 02:52:12.385]  And there was one in Denmark and there was one in Bangladesh.
[02:52:12.385 --> 02:52:15.588]  And both of these studies showed that masks didn't work.
[02:52:15.588 --> 02:52:16.709]  They didn't do anything.
[02:52:16.709 --> 02:52:28.799]  In fact, the Bangladesh study, if you look at the curve of infection on masks, you'd see that the without mask and the with mask, the curves were identical.
[02:52:29.440 --> 02:52:31.661]  They overlapped each other identically.
[02:52:31.661 --> 02:52:37.645]  There was no difference at all in wearing a mask versus not wearing a mask.
[02:52:37.645 --> 02:52:45.570]  And the Bangladesh study was hailed by people like UCSF professor Monica Gandia saying, this is the definitive study.
[02:52:45.570 --> 02:52:49.553]  I'm going to go out and buy my, you know, surgical mask and so forth.
[02:52:49.553 --> 02:52:56.057]  But when you actually requested the data from the researchers who did this study,
[02:52:56.807 --> 02:53:01.008]  And you looked at the data yourself, which is what we did.
[02:53:01.008 --> 02:53:09.330]  And there's a UC Berkeley professor, Ben Recht, who did the analysis and posted it on his blog.
[02:53:09.330 --> 02:53:14.791]  And then we had our statisticians get the data independently from the researchers.
[02:53:14.791 --> 02:53:16.811]  And we did the graphs as well.
[02:53:16.811 --> 02:53:20.112]  And we found out that they were identical.
[02:53:20.112 --> 02:53:24.613]  There was no difference between wearing a mask and not wearing a mask.
[02:53:25.057 --> 02:53:30.942]  And yet we are told all the time, oh, you have to mask up or even double mask.
[02:53:30.942 --> 02:53:35.245]  And the masks do absolutely nothing other than deprive you of oxygen.
[02:53:35.245 --> 02:53:41.270]  By the way, did you see Joe Biden yesterday on vacation in Delaware on a private beach wearing a mask with his wife?
[02:53:41.270 --> 02:53:43.331]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[02:53:43.331 --> 02:53:46.414]  It's totally ridiculous.
[02:53:46.414 --> 02:53:50.457]  And wearing a mask outdoors compounds that.
[02:53:50.457 --> 02:53:51.998]  It's beyond ridiculous.
[02:53:54.034 --> 02:53:58.938]  Nobody catches COVID outside, and the masks do nothing inside.
[02:53:58.938 --> 02:54:02.340]  The masks have zero impact.
[02:54:02.340 --> 02:54:04.942]  And, you know, there's study after study that shows this.
[02:54:05.569 --> 02:54:15.052]  This is why, you know, masks suddenly don't start working against viruses all of a sudden, just because the CDC says so.
[02:54:15.052 --> 02:54:19.874]  You know, if masks worked against viruses before, we would have known it before.
[02:54:19.874 --> 02:54:25.736]  You know, but when this pandemic started, even Fauci said, hey, you know, if it makes you feel better, wear it.
[02:54:26.494 --> 02:54:31.038]  And now all of a sudden the laws of physics have changed.
[02:54:31.038 --> 02:54:34.081]  So the point is that masks are like the canary in the coal mine.
[02:54:34.081 --> 02:54:37.124]  It shows whether they're buying the Kool-Aid.
[02:54:37.124 --> 02:54:44.331]  And when people comply with masks, they're basically saying, hey, we'll do anything you tell us to do, even though it doesn't work.
[02:54:44.331 --> 02:54:48.995]  And this is why the CEOs of two major airlines,
[02:54:49.705 --> 02:54:52.186]  Said, hey, we don't need masks.
[02:54:52.186 --> 02:54:55.367]  We have air filtration and they're right.
[02:54:55.367 --> 02:54:56.688]  They're absolutely right.
[02:54:56.688 --> 02:55:00.989]  It's the air filtration that on on airplanes that makes the difference.
[02:55:00.989 --> 02:55:09.753]  Masks do absolutely nothing other than keep people from breathing and getting the right amount of oxygen and and being more susceptible to respiratory viruses.
[02:55:09.753 --> 02:55:15.955]  So, you know, and nobody's figured this out, even though the data is in plain sight and it's so clear.
[02:55:16.435 --> 02:55:21.001]  And so the mind control over people is just unbelievable.
[02:55:21.001 --> 02:55:21.842]  It certainly is.
[02:55:21.842 --> 02:55:23.684]  In closing, and I could have you back for 10 hours.
[02:55:23.684 --> 02:55:25.346]  We really appreciate you.
[02:55:25.346 --> 02:55:26.808]  What about this other big article?
[02:55:26.808 --> 02:55:30.252]  I see the protest of dead people in South Korea from the shots.
[02:55:30.252 --> 02:55:33.797]  Over 10,000 vaccine deaths in South Korea shortly after vaccination.
[02:55:33.797 --> 02:55:34.538]  What's happening there?
[02:55:35.470 --> 02:55:37.471]  Well, they certainly admitted in South Korea.
[02:55:37.471 --> 02:55:48.298]  You know, South Korea is, you know, only 50 million people in South Korea, but they've got 10,000 that have died, that confirmed died from the vaccine.
[02:55:48.298 --> 02:55:49.139]  That's right.
[02:55:49.139 --> 02:55:50.160]  Their government's not denying it.
[02:55:50.160 --> 02:55:51.220]  That's a big deal, right?
[02:55:51.220 --> 02:55:52.261]  Their government's not denying it.
[02:55:53.286 --> 02:55:54.427]  Yeah, the government's not denying it.
[02:55:54.427 --> 02:55:59.409]  They're actually compensating people for the vaccine deaths in South Korea.
[02:55:59.409 --> 02:56:03.671]  But, you know, it's one-sixth the population of the U.S.
[02:56:03.671 --> 02:56:05.772]  or, you know, one-seventh the population.
[02:56:05.772 --> 02:56:08.373]  So that should be 70,000 in the U.S.
[02:56:08.373 --> 02:56:10.614]  at a minimum.
[02:56:10.614 --> 02:56:11.574]  70,000 people in the U.S.
[02:56:11.574 --> 02:56:15.716]  And we should have stopped these vaccines after 35 people have died.
[02:56:15.716 --> 02:56:17.757]  It is insane what we're doing.
[02:56:17.757 --> 02:56:21.999]  And by the way, we just had a, recently there was a report of a three-year-old.
[02:56:22.816 --> 02:56:27.241]  Who one day after getting the vaccine dies of a heart attack.
[02:56:27.241 --> 02:56:28.642]  I saw that.
[02:56:28.642 --> 02:56:29.764]  Perfectly healthy.
[02:56:29.764 --> 02:56:32.126]  And here's the telling thing.
[02:56:32.126 --> 02:56:37.312]  There wasn't any fact checker to say, oh, that wasn't true.
[02:56:37.312 --> 02:56:42.758]  So sometimes you can learn a lot by when you don't see a fact check on stories.
[02:56:43.137 --> 02:56:45.098]  Because it's too devastating.
[02:56:45.098 --> 02:56:49.280]  They don't want to do a fact check on this story because it was just draw attention to it.
[02:56:49.280 --> 02:56:49.941]  Exactly.
[02:56:49.941 --> 02:56:51.542]  They don't want to draw attention.
[02:56:51.542 --> 02:57:00.947]  Did you see where Bill Gates said, like, months ago, back in August, with Anderson Cooper, let's take away Social Security, and then they fact checked and said it wasn't true?
[02:57:00.947 --> 02:57:04.248]  He says it on tape!
[02:57:04.248 --> 02:57:04.429]  Yeah.
[02:57:10.094 --> 02:57:10.874]  Steve, don't hang up.
[02:57:10.874 --> 02:57:11.735]  Do five more minutes with me.
[02:57:11.735 --> 02:57:12.655]  I want you to be able to finish up.
[02:57:12.655 --> 02:57:14.056]  Steve Kirsch is here with us.
[02:57:14.056 --> 02:57:15.917]  And yes, Dr. Robert Malone is in an airplane to Austin.
[02:57:15.917 --> 02:57:17.758]  He'll be on Joe Rogan tomorrow.
[02:57:17.758 --> 02:57:19.178]  I knew about that earlier, but couldn't talk about it.
[02:57:19.178 --> 02:57:21.119]  But now Malone has put it out on Telegram.
[02:57:21.119 --> 02:57:22.360]  He's banned on Twitter.
[02:57:22.360 --> 02:57:25.381]  And so don't take any of this stuff for granted.
[02:57:25.381 --> 02:57:26.662]  Not what Steve Kirsch is covering.
[02:57:26.662 --> 02:57:27.683]  Not what Joe Rogan's covering.
[02:57:27.683 --> 02:57:28.683]  Not what Dr. Malone's covering.
[02:57:28.683 --> 02:57:30.264]  Not what Robert F. Kennedy's covering.
[02:57:30.264 --> 02:57:32.305]  This is all precious.
[02:57:32.305 --> 02:57:37.667]  As the old Internet saying says, the propaganda wouldn't be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[02:57:37.667 --> 02:57:38.548]  And it's not hopeless.
[02:57:39.815 --> 02:57:42.038]  The pendulum is swinging back in our direction.
[02:57:42.038 --> 02:57:43.760]  The question is how many children have to die first.
[02:57:47.108 --> 02:57:52.632]  I'm cutting this announcement on the morning of December 28th, 2021.
[02:57:52.632 --> 02:58:02.838]  And that means you've only got until Thursday morning, or less than two days, to take advantage of the biggest sales of 2021.

[02:58:09.843 --> 02:58:13.585]  DNA Force Plus is about to go off sale.
[02:58:13.585 --> 02:58:16.027]  VitaMineral Fusion is about to go off sale.
[02:58:16.807 --> 02:58:20.969]  Ultimate Bone Broth that we finally got reformulated and back in stock.
[02:58:20.969 --> 02:58:28.514]  It is going to be ending its sale along with more than 50 other products at InfoWarsTore.com and the free shipping.
[02:58:28.514 --> 02:58:35.197]  So you've got until Thursday to get the best deals of 2021 and they're gone, they're over.
[02:58:35.197 --> 02:58:39.280]  We were going to run them through to the new year but most of these products have almost sold out.
[02:58:39.280 --> 02:58:40.460]  A lot have already sold out.
[02:58:40.460 --> 02:58:41.641]  So thanks for keeping us on the air.
[02:58:41.641 --> 02:58:42.482]  These are great products.
[02:58:42.482 --> 02:58:43.602]  It's a win-win.
[02:58:43.602 --> 02:58:44.723]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:58:46.804 --> 02:58:50.526]  Everything I do is about victory for humanity.
[02:58:50.526 --> 02:58:56.388]  Everything I promote is about standing up against the New World Order by empowering humanity.
[02:58:56.388 --> 02:58:58.569]  Well, that's why ResetWars.com is so important.
[02:58:58.569 --> 02:59:13.115]  Not only is it a game-changing course of critical information to unlock your mind from the Matrix, but it's something that gets around Klaus Schwab's attempt to shut down American infrastructure and American jobs.
[02:59:13.835 --> 02:59:16.057]  It is the true digital economy.
[02:59:16.057 --> 02:59:20.200]  It's the spiritual economy of the mind and transcendental control.
[02:59:21.206 --> 02:59:29.274]  I've been on there 28 years, and all of our work has been amazing, thanks to God and God's divine empowerment and blessing.
[02:59:29.274 --> 02:59:39.944]  But I gotta tell you, out of everything I've done, Reset Wars is the most important, and it is now available, now the month of December 2021 is here, at ResetWars.com.
[02:59:39.944 --> 02:59:44.048]  Start your journey to the next level today at ResetWars.com.
[02:59:44.048 --> 02:59:46.330]  The globalists fear this information.
[02:59:48.519 --> 02:59:53.140]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:59:53.140 --> 03:00:01.022]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:01.022 --> 03:00:11.604]  Alright, investigative journalist Steve Kirsch has held over a little bit into this hour with us.
[03:00:12.725 --> 03:00:18.288]  Harrison Smith is loaded for bear and about to take over in the next hour at Owen Schroer in the War Room.
[03:00:18.288 --> 03:00:28.314]  But Steve Kirsch, when did you have a chance to put bookends on the bombshell information you were laying out last hour?
[03:00:28.314 --> 03:00:32.677]  These vaccines are basically killing more people than they're saving.
[03:00:32.677 --> 03:00:35.198]  We're seeing evidence of that everywhere.
[03:00:35.198 --> 03:00:37.720]  The myocarditis rates are off the charts.
[03:00:40.001 --> 03:00:42.003]  I did a survey of healthcare workers.
[03:00:42.003 --> 03:00:43.565]  I've got a thousand healthcare workers.
[03:00:43.565 --> 03:00:47.229]  These are doctors, nurses, pharmacists.
[03:00:47.229 --> 03:00:52.455]  The survey showed that this was never a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[03:00:52.455 --> 03:00:54.678]  Not before and not now.
[03:00:56.894 --> 03:01:06.959]  I asked them about the myocarditis rates and most people said that the myocarditis rates are way, way up after the vaccines rolled out.
[03:01:06.959 --> 03:01:12.421]  And so it's not what people have been led to believe that, oh, it's going to save you from myocarditis.
[03:01:12.421 --> 03:01:14.242]  Everybody's been seeing either
[03:01:15.097 --> 03:01:20.720]  Higher or way higher rates of myocarditis after the vaccines have rolled out.
[03:01:20.720 --> 03:01:26.242]  So it's not true that the vaccines are having lower rates of myocarditis than COVID.
[03:01:26.242 --> 03:01:27.323]  This is just a myth.
[03:01:27.323 --> 03:01:33.006]  I mean, we've been fooled by the CDC and the advice from the CDC is terrible.
[03:01:33.006 --> 03:01:41.930]  In fact, if you were to do the opposite, if you were to actually get early treatment using ivermectin and other drugs, I mean, ivermectin was the reason Japan
[03:01:42.610 --> 03:01:45.092]  And what is the same in a bunch of African countries?
[03:01:45.092 --> 03:01:48.734]  Like the countries that did it have no problem, those that didn't are devastated?
[03:02:00.205 --> 03:02:04.407]  Yeah, I mean, yeah, it's, you know, it's shown, right?
[03:02:04.407 --> 03:02:16.254]  You never see a story, a news story of somebody who was treated with an early treatment protocol that you say ivermectin or fluvoxamine, who ended up hospitalized and dead.
[03:02:16.254 --> 03:02:21.757]  I mean, I've never heard of a case where somebody died who was treated early.
[03:02:21.757 --> 03:02:28.040]  You know, the Frieden-Tyson early treatment protocol was offered to the CDC back in March of 2020.
[03:02:29.421 --> 03:02:30.202]  March of 2020.
[03:02:30.202 --> 03:02:31.662]  Not 2021.
[03:02:31.662 --> 03:02:33.263]  March of 2020.
[03:02:33.263 --> 03:02:37.085]  And the CDC and the FDA and the NIH basically ignored it.
[03:02:37.085 --> 03:02:43.769]  These two physicians have treated over 7,000 patients and have zero deaths.
[03:02:43.769 --> 03:02:45.030]  Zero deaths!
[03:02:45.030 --> 03:02:47.671]  Let me ask you this in closing, Steve.
[03:02:47.671 --> 03:02:49.572]  How do you see the system getting out of this?
[03:02:49.572 --> 03:02:54.535]  I think they've really dug their own pit here.
[03:02:54.535 --> 03:02:58.577]  I think it's going to get... I think Joe Rogan
[03:02:59.424 --> 03:03:06.546]  You know, Peter McCullough was the top, the highest views on Joe Rogan was the Peter McCullough episode.
[03:03:06.546 --> 03:03:14.989]  And I think Robert Malone will break through that and if RFK is on Joe Rogan, that will be the straw that breaks the camel's back.
[03:03:14.989 --> 03:03:19.731]  So, I think Joe Rogan can actually single-handedly shift
[03:03:20.532 --> 03:03:36.871]  This balance, but it's also that health care workers are so distraught by what is happening that they are willing to go out and risk their entire career and to risk being D license because they are so appalled.
[03:03:37.472 --> 03:03:38.973]  By what is going on.
[03:03:38.973 --> 03:03:44.695]  Like Nicole Belland, she's a pharmacist at Safeway.
[03:03:44.695 --> 03:03:47.317]  She says, these shots are killing people.
[03:03:47.317 --> 03:03:51.358]  I refuse to give these vaccines anymore.
[03:03:51.358 --> 03:03:52.459]  I quit.
[03:03:52.459 --> 03:03:54.100]  And she was on camera doing that.
[03:03:54.100 --> 03:03:55.981]  She is now being pursued.
[03:03:55.981 --> 03:04:03.224]  They are trying to take away her ability to be a pharmacist by taking away her license.
[03:04:03.504 --> 03:04:04.005]  I'm so good.
[03:04:16.502 --> 03:04:16.722]  Sure.
[03:04:16.722 --> 03:04:18.083]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[03:04:18.083 --> 03:04:18.463]  Wow.
[03:04:18.463 --> 03:04:19.584]  Powerful information.
[03:04:19.584 --> 03:04:21.246]  Thanks for coming on, Steve, on short notice.
[03:04:21.246 --> 03:04:21.886]  Man, wow.
[03:04:21.886 --> 03:04:22.667]  Got to read his stuff.
[03:04:22.667 --> 03:04:23.347]  Got to share it.
[03:04:23.347 --> 03:04:25.669]  And yeah, big stuff with Joe Rogan tomorrow.
[03:04:25.669 --> 03:04:27.570]  Very excited about that.
[03:04:27.570 --> 03:04:32.033]  I want to play this nurse who knocked it out of the park in Louisiana, exposing maternity.
[03:04:32.033 --> 03:04:33.414]  We come back and then...
[03:04:34.375 --> 03:04:36.376]  The one, the only, Harrison Smith's taking over.
[03:04:36.376 --> 03:04:38.196]  Please don't forget, today's the last day.
[03:04:38.196 --> 03:04:44.539]  Free shipping, double patriot points, up to 60% off on great things like Vitamin Mineral Fusion, DNA Forts, and more.
[03:04:44.539 --> 03:04:50.981]  That big sale that keeps us on air ends tonight at midnight at infowarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:04:50.981 --> 03:04:51.381]  We'll be back.
[03:04:51.381 --> 03:04:51.881]  Stay with us.
[03:04:57.110 --> 03:05:01.312]  I never compromise the quality of ingredients we put in InfoWars Live products.
[03:05:01.312 --> 03:05:04.873]  And that's why for more than two years we've been sold out of Ultimate Bone Broth.
[03:05:04.873 --> 03:05:07.474]  And we could never get the ingredients again.
[03:05:07.474 --> 03:05:08.434]  Until now.
[03:05:08.434 --> 03:05:14.516]  And we have reformulated and not just used the same ingredients, we've boosted it and made them even stronger.
[03:05:14.516 --> 03:05:18.278]  So out of all the bone broths out there, I'm telling you, this is next level.
[03:05:18.278 --> 03:05:19.518]  Listen to what it's got in it.
[03:05:19.518 --> 03:05:24.300]  Cutting edge chicken bone broth protein isolate powder for better flavor and dissolvability.
[03:05:24.700 --> 03:05:24.800]  It's
[03:05:41.340 --> 03:05:41.640]  We're good.
[03:06:11.517 --> 03:06:12.638]  InfoWars.
[03:06:12.638 --> 03:06:16.960]  Tomorrow's news today.
[03:06:16.960 --> 03:06:18.381]  My name is Colette Martin.
[03:06:18.381 --> 03:06:26.485]  I'm an RN of 17 years, 12 years oncology, and the past five years I've been a float resource nurse to all the different floors in the hospital.
[03:06:26.485 --> 03:06:30.987]  I'm extremely concerned with the idea of mandating this vaccine for our children.
[03:06:30.987 --> 03:06:35.589]  The reactions we're seeing in the hospital with adults are terrifying and they're being ignored.
[03:06:35.589 --> 03:06:38.651]  Just some examples of post-vaccine reactions are blood clots,
[03:06:39.454 --> 03:06:39.714]  Thank you.
[03:06:55.603 --> 03:06:58.785]  Tingling and numbness to lower extremities, they're still dealing with.
[03:06:58.785 --> 03:07:01.006]  Another co-worker developed DVTs.
[03:07:01.006 --> 03:07:07.089]  I personally had a patient die three months after his vaccines of pericarditis, which we know is a known side effect.
[03:07:07.089 --> 03:07:10.791]  Diagnosed 30 days after a shot, no mention to VAERS.
[03:07:10.791 --> 03:07:15.913]  Majority of our nurses, nurse managers, and some doctors do not even know what VAERS is.
[03:07:15.913 --> 03:07:23.277]  I've spoken to our chief of medicine, managers, other nurses on why we're not reporting to VAERS, and the most common response is, what is VAERS?
[03:07:24.295 --> 03:07:28.059]  It's a topic that's very difficult to address in the hospital setting.
[03:07:28.059 --> 03:07:31.162]  I bring up my concerns and repeatedly get dismissed.
[03:07:31.162 --> 03:07:34.265]  I've been told, I'm sure someone is investigating this.
[03:07:34.265 --> 03:07:36.267]  Well, if we aren't, then who is?
[03:07:36.267 --> 03:07:41.312]  Especially since Pfizer ended their study just six months after the trial started.
[03:07:41.312 --> 03:07:45.375]  I've also been told that VAERS isn't the best indication of vaccine side effects.
[03:07:45.375 --> 03:07:47.698]  Well, if that's the case, what are we supposed to be looking at?
[03:07:48.462 --> 03:07:55.824]  Over 18,000 deaths, a million permanently disabled, and the CDC admits only 1-10% of reactions are even being reported.
[03:07:55.824 --> 03:07:58.885]  And we know that hospitals are not reporting anything.
[03:07:58.885 --> 03:08:00.726]  This is not just where I work.
[03:08:00.726 --> 03:08:05.147]  I have many nurse friends in other local hospitals in the Southeast Louisiana say the same thing.
[03:08:05.828 --> 03:08:09.511]  What I also find is highly disturbing is our treatment protocol.
[03:08:09.511 --> 03:08:12.854]  I truly believe our protocol is killing our COVID patients.
[03:08:12.854 --> 03:08:15.816]  When I ask other nurses their thoughts, they agree.
[03:08:15.816 --> 03:08:19.339]  At this point, doctors will admit our main treatment is not working.
[03:08:19.339 --> 03:08:20.740]  But it's all we have.
[03:08:20.740 --> 03:08:22.381]  We know that's simply not true.
[03:08:22.381 --> 03:08:24.563]  It's just what the CDC will allow us to give.
[03:08:24.563 --> 03:08:26.264]  Our hands are tied.
[03:08:26.264 --> 03:08:27.966]  Back to our children, though.
[03:08:27.966 --> 03:08:34.371]  We have chemotherapies that we know have side effects causing blood cancer such as leukemia in 10 plus years after giving the drug.
[03:08:34.938 --> 03:08:38.922]  We know this because we have real long-term trials on these drugs.
[03:08:38.922 --> 03:08:45.067]  We are not just seeing severe acute reactions with this vaccine, but we have zero idea what any long-term reactions are.
[03:08:45.067 --> 03:08:48.570]  Cancers, autoimmune, infertility, we just don't know.
[03:08:48.570 --> 03:08:53.855]  We are potentially sacrificing our children for fear of maybe dying getting sick of a virus.
[03:08:53.855 --> 03:08:55.056]  A virus with a 99% survival rate.
[03:08:56.657 --> 03:08:58.979]  Our children are not even at risk for this.
[03:08:58.979 --> 03:09:03.764]  As of now we have more children that's died from the COVID vaccine than of COVID itself.
[03:09:03.764 --> 03:09:10.390]  And then the health department to come out and say the new variant has all the side effects of the vaccine reactions we're currently seeing now.
[03:09:10.390 --> 03:09:16.796]  It's maddening and I don't understand why more people don't see it and I think they do but fear speaking out and even worse being fired.
[03:09:17.344 --> 03:09:26.728]  They simply, this is not something easy for me to come up here and speak about, but I feel deep conviction about speaking truth and what the nurses are saying behind those hospital walls.
[03:09:26.728 --> 03:09:31.170]  This is not about adults who can choose to research or not, this is about our helpless children.
[03:09:31.170 --> 03:09:38.954]  And when I look back on this in 20 to 30 years, I have to know that I did everything I could, and I'm asking you to please ponder this.
[03:09:38.954 --> 03:09:41.295]  What side of history will you be on?
[03:09:41.295 --> 03:09:43.256]  I have to know this madness has to stop.
[03:09:44.457 --> 03:09:46.438]  Wow, incredibly, incredibly powerful stuff.
[03:09:46.438 --> 03:09:47.939]  There's a story at InfoWars.com.
[03:09:47.939 --> 03:09:51.521]  WHO warns of global healthcare collapse they triggered with COVID hysteria.
[03:09:51.521 --> 03:09:53.042]  That's this program.
[03:09:53.042 --> 03:09:54.803]  Very, very happy to be here with you.
[03:09:54.803 --> 03:09:58.605]  My name is Harrison Smith, hosting the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:09:58.605 --> 03:10:02.147]  Of course, my program is the American Journal each and every weekday from 8 a.m.
[03:10:02.147 --> 03:10:02.508]  to 11 a.m.
[03:10:02.508 --> 03:10:02.788]  And I think
[03:10:05.189 --> 03:10:12.520]  Maybe everybody's noticed at this point something very strange is going on in the world of mainstream media and COVID hysteria.
[03:10:12.520 --> 03:10:15.324]  They're changing their minds for some reason.
[03:10:15.324 --> 03:10:16.226]  What's happening here?
[03:10:16.226 --> 03:10:19.851]  We'll try to puzzle through that in this hour because it seems like they're just...
[03:10:20.812 --> 03:10:21.072]  I don't know.
[03:10:36.681 --> 03:10:36.721]  In
[03:10:54.255 --> 03:11:01.980]  A little bit of trouble and panicking how to get out of it and I guess their reaction is just to do away with all of the stuff they've been saying this whole year.
[03:11:01.980 --> 03:11:03.321]  Trust science is all about the science.
[03:11:03.321 --> 03:11:10.045]  Now the science is rapidly changing and actually not that important because there's people out of work and we need to get them back into the office.
[03:11:10.045 --> 03:11:18.891]  It's really incredible the admissions that they're making and I have plenty of videos to show you just in the last day or two that shows extreme reversals to all of their policies.
[03:11:19.511 --> 03:11:21.452]  That they've been implementing thus far.
[03:11:21.452 --> 03:11:26.394]  And I was saying on my show this morning, you don't get to pretend like you're just realizing this.
[03:11:26.394 --> 03:11:34.377]  You don't get to pretend like you've just had a revelation and that you didn't realize all of the negative consequences to what you mandated for the rest of the world.
[03:11:34.377 --> 03:11:36.518]  We've been telling you this since the beginning.
[03:11:36.518 --> 03:11:40.099]  We've been telling you this since before you even implemented the policies themselves.
[03:11:40.099 --> 03:11:44.401]  So you don't get to just pretend like we're all coming to this revelation all together.
[03:11:44.401 --> 03:11:47.222]  And you know, like Jennifer Rubin from the Washington Post saying,
[03:11:47.662 --> 03:11:52.366]  You know, I think this might be, you know, COVID might be something that we just have to live with.
[03:11:52.366 --> 03:11:53.648]  We just have to learn to live with this.
[03:11:53.648 --> 03:11:55.630]  Maybe we're not going to defeat this.
[03:11:55.630 --> 03:11:57.591]  You're looking around like, yeah, we know.
[03:11:57.591 --> 03:11:58.012]  Yeah.
[03:11:58.012 --> 03:11:58.172]  Yeah.
[03:11:58.172 --> 03:11:58.372]  Yeah.
[03:11:58.372 --> 03:11:58.933]  We know.
[03:11:58.933 --> 03:11:59.213]  We know.
[03:11:59.213 --> 03:12:01.655]  Welcome to the team, but admit you're wrong.
[03:12:01.655 --> 03:12:02.876]  Admit you were wrong the whole time.
[03:12:02.876 --> 03:12:10.784]  You have to face the facts that everything you've been saying this entire time has been utterly baseless and everything that you've been implementing has been
[03:12:11.384 --> 03:12:15.368]  Completely counteractive to your stated goals.
[03:12:15.368 --> 03:12:16.869]  You've made all the cases worse.
[03:12:16.869 --> 03:12:19.972]  The lockdown has just absolutely destroyed the entire world.
[03:12:19.972 --> 03:12:21.193]  Starvation has already begun.
[03:12:21.193 --> 03:12:29.020]  150 dead in Tigray, that's the latest report, with a million on the cusp, waiting desperately for the largess from America and other Western countries.
[03:12:29.020 --> 03:12:35.646]  That's not going to come because, as Alex Jones has said oh so many times, when the first world collapses, the third world starves.
[03:12:35.646 --> 03:12:36.987]  And it's starting, folks.
[03:12:37.407 --> 03:12:40.510]  China, major, major moves happening there.
[03:12:40.510 --> 03:12:41.971]  Very, again, kind of strange.
[03:12:41.971 --> 03:12:49.857]  You never really know what's true and what's not coming out of China, but thus is existence in an authoritarian regime, in a communist regime.
[03:12:49.857 --> 03:12:50.658]  Is it real?
[03:12:50.658 --> 03:12:51.578]  Is it pretend?
[03:12:51.578 --> 03:12:52.759]  Will anybody tell the truth?
[03:12:52.759 --> 03:12:54.901]  No, of course not, because they're all controlled.
[03:12:54.901 --> 03:12:57.924]  So we just have to go with what little information that we do have.
[03:12:58.945 --> 03:13:08.481]  Of course, the biggest story is that Twitter has now suspended the creator of the technology upon which the mRNA vaccine is based, Dr. Robert Malone.
[03:13:09.680 --> 03:13:14.102]  It's still a little bit unclear to me what his last post was or what he was kicked off of Twitter for.
[03:13:14.102 --> 03:13:25.727]  I don't think we've gotten the official word on that, but we do have our agents out there in the field, and I have been shared a very, very powerful video that I'm told was the reason that he was kicked off.
[03:13:25.727 --> 03:13:32.569]  It's actually a 40-minute video, so we won't be able to play the full thing here, but I cut out the first about eight minutes, and I'm going to play that for you in full.
[03:13:32.569 --> 03:13:35.851]  It's a video from a group called the Canadian COVID Care Alliance.
[03:13:37.211 --> 03:13:47.397]  From what I understand, or from what's been told to me, this was the video that actually got Dr. Robert Malone kicked off of Twitter, which is why we'll be showing it here, because, hey, that's what we're here for, isn't it?
[03:13:47.397 --> 03:13:50.558]  Banned.Video is called Banned.Video for a reason.
[03:13:50.558 --> 03:13:59.083]  When things get banned elsewhere, they always have a nice, comfortable home here on InfoWars, Banned.Video, NewsWars, and all of the amazing outlets that we have.
[03:13:59.083 --> 03:14:01.844]  That, of course, is all funded by you by going to InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:14:03.425 --> 03:14:09.971]  It's really kind of slowly but surely becoming one of the most powerful weapons in our fight against globalism.
[03:14:09.971 --> 03:14:12.294]  Bandod Video, as we bring on more and more people.
[03:14:12.294 --> 03:14:14.636]  Two new creators were just added to Bandod Video.
[03:14:14.636 --> 03:14:17.219]  We're getting more on every day, it seems.
[03:14:17.219 --> 03:14:19.381]  Onboarding them, getting them to upload videos.
[03:14:19.381 --> 03:14:23.264]  I mean, Bandod Video is going to be an archive of the truth, just in a...
[03:14:23.965 --> 03:14:25.946]  In a internet awash with lies.
[03:14:25.946 --> 03:14:27.047]  It really is a powerful thing.
[03:14:27.047 --> 03:14:29.288]  And of course, it's all thanks to you.
[03:14:29.288 --> 03:14:32.989]  We always talk about putting on the shows and the reporters and InfoWars.com.
[03:14:32.989 --> 03:14:34.870]  Of course, that's all funded by InfoWars Store.
[03:14:34.870 --> 03:14:40.773]  But BandDot Video is really the sleeping giant that is just now stirring and ready to awake.
[03:14:40.773 --> 03:14:43.675]  So very, very interesting stuff to talk about.
[03:14:44.724 --> 03:14:53.288]  And all of these changes with COVID-19, all of these interesting revelations that all of these lockdown leftists are suddenly having today.
[03:14:53.288 --> 03:14:54.229]  What could be behind it?
[03:14:54.229 --> 03:14:55.650]  What could be the cause of it?
[03:14:55.650 --> 03:14:57.050]  Is it purely political?
[03:14:57.050 --> 03:14:58.671]  Is it economic?
[03:14:58.671 --> 03:14:59.892]  Well, we'll answer some of those questions.
[03:14:59.892 --> 03:15:03.694]  We'll also talk about some of the economics of the vaccines because
[03:15:04.855 --> 03:15:16.665]  Reports are now that by 2022's end, and this is probably a lower-end estimate, it'll be something like $124 billion that Pfizer and Moderna have made from these shots.
[03:15:16.665 --> 03:15:18.307]  $124 billion.
[03:15:18.307 --> 03:15:21.810]  A lot of times we talk about these numbers, but we don't really have anything to attach them to.
[03:15:21.810 --> 03:15:23.511]  And what does that even mean, $124 billion?
[03:15:23.511 --> 03:15:25.493]  What could you buy with that type of money?
[03:15:25.493 --> 03:15:26.054]  I'll tell you.
[03:15:26.054 --> 03:15:28.235]  I'll explain to you in human terms exactly
[03:15:30.262 --> 03:15:37.549]  The sheer level of fortune that has been expended from your tax dollars into the pockets of pharmaceutical masters.
[03:15:37.549 --> 03:15:40.311]  And don't they deserve it?
[03:15:40.311 --> 03:15:41.192]  Don't they deserve it, folks?
[03:15:41.192 --> 03:15:48.398]  Don't they deserve $124 billion for poisoning the planet and giving us a vaccine that doesn't work and actually destroys your immune system?
[03:15:48.398 --> 03:15:50.981]  I think they deserve $500 billion.
[03:15:50.981 --> 03:15:51.561]  Why not?
[03:15:51.561 --> 03:15:52.362]  Money isn't real.
[03:15:52.362 --> 03:15:53.042]  We'll be right back.
[03:15:53.042 --> 03:15:53.503]  Stay tuned.
[03:15:56.007 --> 03:16:07.742]  So, when I first started taking Survival Shield, basically I was 275 pounds, I was overweight, I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe, I was barely holding on to a job, and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[03:16:07.742 --> 03:16:10.826]  So the first one I got was the original Survival Shield, the X1, and it was
[03:16:11.667 --> 03:16:12.067]  We're good.
[03:16:27.620 --> 03:16:29.260]  Beautifully said, brother.
[03:16:29.260 --> 03:16:31.401]  I thank you so much for your call, and Godspeed.
[03:16:55.825 --> 03:17:05.595]  Since the end of World War II, the globalists have been building their private corporate world government, whose endgame, once they get control, is forced depopulation of the planet.
[03:17:05.595 --> 03:17:16.365]  That's why as we begin to leave the year 2021 and go into 2022, I am encouraging all of you out there watching and listening to count the cost and to realize how much danger you and your family are in.
[03:17:16.365 --> 03:17:18.487]  The globalists are coming after everybody.
[03:17:18.487 --> 03:17:19.969]  They are setting up a dystopic
[03:17:20.289 --> 03:17:23.231]  Planetary authoritarian technocracy.
[03:17:23.231 --> 03:17:25.693]  A dictatorship of the globalist.
[03:17:25.693 --> 03:17:28.114]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[03:17:28.114 --> 03:17:33.117]  Your investment in us over the years, buying our products, spreading the word, and praying for us has been incredible.
[03:17:33.117 --> 03:17:38.721]  But I'm telling you right now, we're about to lose not just InfoWars, but the entire country and the world to tyranny.
[03:17:38.721 --> 03:17:42.323]  So now, everything you've done in the past needs to be redoubled today.
[03:17:42.323 --> 03:17:47.527]  And InfoWarsStore.com is one of the most important places you can go to buy great products and fund the tip of the spear.
[03:17:47.987 --> 03:17:49.148]  I will go down with a shiv.
[03:17:49.148 --> 03:17:50.148]  I'm not going to back down.
[03:17:50.148 --> 03:17:51.869]  I'm getting even more hardcore in their face.
[03:17:51.869 --> 03:17:55.792]  But I can't stay in the fight 100% unless you support us, so please go to InfoWarshow.com.
[03:17:55.792 --> 03:18:00.635]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalists.
[03:18:00.635 --> 03:18:02.696]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[03:18:02.696 --> 03:18:08.179]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[03:18:08.179 --> 03:18:09.300]  But we failed.
[03:18:09.300 --> 03:18:10.941]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[03:18:10.941 --> 03:18:12.442]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat-footed.
[03:18:12.802 --> 03:18:18.807]  But they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization Great Reset.
[03:18:18.807 --> 03:18:27.735]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show, because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[03:18:27.735 --> 03:18:31.038]  So we've got to information warfare the enemy and try to stop their agenda.
[03:18:31.038 --> 03:18:32.940]  We've also got to get personally prepared.
[03:18:32.940 --> 03:18:35.842]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storable food.
[03:18:35.842 --> 03:18:38.665]  We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices.
[03:18:39.065 --> 03:18:41.046]  In late August, InfoWars saw an explosion of orders.
[03:19:00.296 --> 03:19:11.920]  Because our audience understands that the globalists are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic and financial collapse worldwide.
[03:19:11.920 --> 03:19:15.581]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been something that's important to have.
[03:19:15.581 --> 03:19:22.284]  It's a checkbox that everybody needs to have taken care of, right along with water filtration, self-defense, and a relationship with God.
[03:19:22.904 --> 03:19:26.986]  But now more than ever, you need to get your storable food orders in now.
[03:19:26.986 --> 03:19:29.728]  We're ready to ship to you within 24 hours of your order.
[03:19:29.728 --> 03:19:30.548]  It's high quality.
[03:19:30.548 --> 03:19:33.750]  It's very, very low cost at InfoWarStore.com.
[03:19:33.750 --> 03:19:41.113]  Because in the future, you're going to see more food supply shortages and you're going to see food supply price increases that are already taking place.
[03:19:41.113 --> 03:19:47.277]  So lock in your storable food now at a lower price and fund the InfoWar at InfoWarStore.com.
[03:19:47.277 --> 03:19:51.759]  That's how you fight the Great Reset, is by being self-sufficient and not under their control.
[03:19:52.039 --> 03:19:58.126]  So get prepared now at m4warestore.com.
[03:19:58.126 --> 03:20:04.054]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:20.421 --> 03:20:21.581]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:20:21.581 --> 03:20:23.662]  This is the Alex Jones Show, fourth hour.
[03:20:23.662 --> 03:20:24.602]  My name's Harrison Smith.
[03:20:24.602 --> 03:20:30.284]  I'm the host of the American Journal here on InfoWars, banned.video, of course.
[03:20:30.284 --> 03:20:37.527]  Strange, strange goings-on in the world of mainstream media and the COVID establishment right now.
[03:20:37.527 --> 03:20:39.647]  Everything seems to be in flux.
[03:20:39.647 --> 03:20:40.748]  Everything's changing.
[03:20:40.748 --> 03:20:43.168]  Everything is nonsense.
[03:20:43.168 --> 03:20:48.110]  Of course, that's nothing new, but it's reached new and absurd levels.
[03:20:48.470 --> 03:20:53.634]  And I'd like to talk about some of these now, and I think we can put our finger on why this may be happening.
[03:20:53.634 --> 03:21:02.579]  From Disclose TV on Twitter, Washington Post calls for shifting focus away from cases to measure the impact of the virus at a time when daily COVID-19 cases in the U.S.
[03:21:02.579 --> 03:21:04.201]  approach pre-Biden levels.
[03:21:04.201 --> 03:21:15.188]  Yes, folks, after two years of focusing on the number of cases that we have as the primary measure for how we're doing against COVID, suddenly, as Joe Biden is in office, we're reaching new levels we've never reached before.
[03:21:15.188 --> 03:21:18.190]  Now I think they think it's time maybe we stop counting cases, you know?
[03:21:18.530 --> 03:21:19.751]  You know, they've had to think about it.
[03:21:19.751 --> 03:21:26.734]  They've really talked it out and they think, you know, maybe cases just isn't the best way to measure this now that they're exploding under our watch.
[03:21:26.734 --> 03:21:30.476]  And maybe that will turn our focus away to something else.
[03:21:30.476 --> 03:21:37.879]  Jennifer Rubin says, as we recognize that COVID-19 is not deadly or even severe disease for the vast majority of responsible Americans.
[03:21:37.879 --> 03:21:40.720]  Yes, yes, we're all realizing this at the same time.
[03:21:40.720 --> 03:21:42.942]  Nobody's been saying this for the last two years.
[03:21:42.942 --> 03:21:43.902]  Nobody's been saying this since
[03:21:44.182 --> 03:21:46.363]  Before COVID even landed on American shores.
[03:21:46.363 --> 03:21:48.044]  No, we're all Jennifer Rubin.
[03:21:48.044 --> 03:21:49.424]  We're all a bunch of morons.
[03:21:49.424 --> 03:21:57.207]  Two years late to the party and we're all just now realizing that COVID has a 99.5% survival rating for most of the population.
[03:21:57.207 --> 03:22:00.348]  The younger and healthier you are, it's actually higher than that.
[03:22:00.348 --> 03:22:01.749]  And we're just now figuring this out.
[03:22:01.749 --> 03:22:02.189]  All of us.
[03:22:02.189 --> 03:22:02.769]  All of you.
[03:22:02.769 --> 03:22:03.009]  Me.
[03:22:03.009 --> 03:22:04.750]  We're all just figuring this out right now.
[03:22:04.750 --> 03:22:05.990]  Nobody said this before.
[03:22:05.990 --> 03:22:07.171]  That's what they want you to think because
[03:22:07.631 --> 03:22:12.774]  I think that, in a way, they're still kind of acting like they have total control of the media.
[03:22:12.774 --> 03:22:15.256]  Like, they're acting as if InfoWars doesn't exist.
[03:22:15.256 --> 03:22:19.039]  They're acting as if you can't get this information except from them.
[03:22:19.039 --> 03:22:23.742]  So, in that way, they get to pretend like we're all coming to this realization all together.
[03:22:23.742 --> 03:22:24.802]  No, moron.
[03:22:24.802 --> 03:22:27.984]  We've known this the whole time, and now it's convenient for you to...
[03:22:29.065 --> 03:22:36.270]  Recognize that this is real because, well, otherwise you would have to face up to the fact that actually now the vaccinated are the ones spreading the disease.
[03:22:36.270 --> 03:22:38.652]  The vaccinated ones are the ones that are more likely to get it.
[03:22:38.652 --> 03:22:41.354]  They're just as likely to transmit it, if not more likely.
[03:22:41.354 --> 03:22:44.136]  We know this from, you know, all the studies that are coming out now.
[03:22:44.136 --> 03:22:53.463]  Of course, Alex was talking about last segment, or last hour rather, the Denmark test that came out showing the negative
[03:22:55.017 --> 03:22:59.581]  Effectiveness of the vaccines after like, you know, a month or so, two months, something like that.
[03:22:59.581 --> 03:23:01.643]  So I went over it today.
[03:23:01.643 --> 03:23:05.446]  Just the timeline of the vaccines is really kind of ridiculous.
[03:23:05.446 --> 03:23:09.109]  You get the first vaccine, then you got to wait two weeks to get the second one.
[03:23:09.109 --> 03:23:11.171]  And I guess you have to wait two weeks to get the third.
[03:23:11.171 --> 03:23:12.812]  You're unvaccinated throughout all of that.
[03:23:12.812 --> 03:23:16.395]  You're still unvaccinated for two weeks after the booster shot, I guess.
[03:23:16.395 --> 03:23:20.459]  I mean, who knows how these laws work or rules or whatever you want to call them.
[03:23:20.959 --> 03:23:25.160]  But that's like, you know, it's a good like month and a half that you're getting vaccines, but you're not vaccinated.
[03:23:25.160 --> 03:23:31.322]  And then two months or two weeks after your final vaccine, you're officially vaccinated and you're good, man.
[03:23:31.322 --> 03:23:32.322]  You can still get it.
[03:23:32.322 --> 03:23:39.364]  You can still transmit it, but you might potentially, we think, maybe kind of have slightly less symptoms.
[03:23:39.364 --> 03:23:41.884]  We're pretty sure for a couple more weeks.
[03:23:41.884 --> 03:23:48.326]  And then actually you have negative efficacy where you're actually more likely to get it, more likely to experience worse symptoms.
[03:23:49.066 --> 03:23:59.541]  Get your vaccine, because after a month or so, you get a couple weeks of maybe some protection, and then everything gets worse, and you're actually falling for this, for a disease with 99.5% survival rating.
[03:23:59.541 --> 03:24:00.462]  It's been known the whole time.
[03:24:00.462 --> 03:24:01.504]  None of this is new.
[03:24:01.504 --> 03:24:04.148]  They're pretending like it is, and there's reasons for that.
[03:24:05.643 --> 03:24:06.644]  COVID news, U.S.
[03:24:06.644 --> 03:24:10.108]  daily record for cases broken as the third year of the pandemic loomed.
[03:24:10.108 --> 03:24:11.429]  The seven-day average of U.S.
[03:24:11.429 --> 03:24:16.134]  cases topped 267,000 on Tuesday, according to a New York Times database.
[03:24:16.134 --> 03:24:23.681]  The milestone was marked after a year that whipsawed Americans from relaxation of the rules in the spring to a Delta-driven summer.
[03:24:23.681 --> 03:24:27.265]  It's just imagine, imagine your life being defined by these...
[03:24:28.673 --> 03:24:32.536]  Psychopaths fabricated outrage, or fabricated panic.
[03:24:32.536 --> 03:24:34.237]  I feel sorry for you if that's the case.
[03:24:34.237 --> 03:24:37.939]  And honestly, it's the case for a large percentage of the American people.
[03:24:37.939 --> 03:24:39.820]  You can see it just by walking around now.
[03:24:39.820 --> 03:24:45.604]  Places that were full of life, no masks at the end of November, now are empty with people wearing masks.
[03:24:45.604 --> 03:24:46.305]  I mean, they're scared.
[03:24:46.305 --> 03:24:47.245]  They're scared by this.
[03:24:47.245 --> 03:24:52.829]  They're puppets that are pulled around by strings, manipulated by people who despise them, and then they wonder why they're miserable.
[03:24:53.169 --> 03:24:54.390]  It's actually not that complicated.
[03:24:54.390 --> 03:25:06.600]  Of course, Echo Chamber on Echo Chambers with a Z on Twitter says, a few months ago, Jennifer Rubin was insisting that we strip the uninjected of their rights because they were a breeding ground for the dangerous coronavirus variant.
[03:25:06.600 --> 03:25:09.862]  Now that she's a breeding ground, she thinks she deserves rights.
[03:25:09.862 --> 03:25:15.066]  Isn't that interesting how things change when they're on the suffering end?
[03:25:15.066 --> 03:25:16.408]  How very convenient for them.
[03:25:17.048 --> 03:25:18.228]  But it's not just the vaccines.
[03:25:18.228 --> 03:25:25.330]  It's not just the efficacy of the vaccines or the lockdowns or the social distancing or the isolation time.
[03:25:25.330 --> 03:25:29.952]  I mean, they're changing all of it willy-nilly, completely at random and capriciously.
[03:25:29.952 --> 03:25:31.312]  But it's not just that.
[03:25:31.312 --> 03:25:32.352]  It's the masks as well.
[03:25:32.352 --> 03:25:34.493]  Let's go now to video A here.
[03:25:34.493 --> 03:25:38.034]  CNN experts straight up admitting cloths don't work.
[03:25:38.034 --> 03:25:40.315]  They've never worked and they're pretty silly and they're laughing at you.
[03:25:40.315 --> 03:25:40.675]  Let's watch.
[03:25:41.923 --> 03:25:45.830]  Cloth masks are not appropriate for this pandemic.
[03:25:45.830 --> 03:25:53.984]  It's not appropriate for Omicron, it was not appropriate for Delta, Alpha, or any of the previous variants either, because we're dealing with something that's airborne.
[03:25:56.350 --> 03:25:58.552]  Yeah, yeah, we know.
[03:25:58.552 --> 03:25:59.994]  Yeah, we're well aware of this.
[03:25:59.994 --> 03:26:02.877]  Thank you for torturing us for two years.
[03:26:02.877 --> 03:26:09.884]  Thank you so much for ignoring what we've been saying for so long and then acting like this is just normal, like this is okay.
[03:26:09.884 --> 03:26:13.468]  You can say, and this is, I, you know, saying earlier this morning that...
[03:26:14.758 --> 03:26:17.922]  This might be the worst part about being an info warrior.
[03:26:17.922 --> 03:26:27.595]  Not the knowing of everything before it happens, because that can be very frustrating when you're sitting here just shouting from the mountaintops, here's what's happening, masks don't work, the vaccine is killing you, nobody listens, nobody cares.
[03:26:27.595 --> 03:26:29.057]  That can be rather frustrating.
[03:26:29.057 --> 03:26:29.358]  No, no.
[03:26:29.358 --> 03:26:30.839]  The worst part is hearing
[03:26:31.955 --> 03:26:43.463]  Worms, like that wind woman, act like, just with that big smile on her face, act like she hasn't been calling for people who don't wear masks to be imprisoned for the last year.
[03:26:43.463 --> 03:26:47.005]  She's just so happily, look, masks don't work, it's an airborne virus.
[03:26:47.005 --> 03:26:47.746]  Thank God we know!
[03:26:48.206 --> 03:26:48.646]  We know.
[03:26:48.646 --> 03:26:49.326]  We're well aware.
[03:26:49.326 --> 03:26:53.008]  Thank you so much for confirming what we've been saying for this entire time.
[03:26:53.008 --> 03:26:56.229]  Maybe somebody needs to be punished for this misinformation then.
[03:26:56.229 --> 03:26:59.030]  Nobody calling for masks is getting kicked off of Twitter, right?
[03:26:59.030 --> 03:27:04.431]  Nobody's saying the vaccines are very effective and you won't get the virus if you get the vaccine.
[03:27:04.431 --> 03:27:05.572]  They're not getting kicked off Twitter.
[03:27:05.572 --> 03:27:06.492]  It's misinformation.
[03:27:06.492 --> 03:27:08.413]  I think we all can recognize that at this point.
[03:27:09.093 --> 03:27:21.281]  Let's now take a look at Biden's CDC director, Ole Miss Walensky over there, talking about why they decided to change the COVID isolation rules from 10 days to 5 days.
[03:27:21.281 --> 03:27:22.302]  Trust the science, folks.
[03:27:22.302 --> 03:27:23.783]  Let's watch.
[03:27:23.783 --> 03:27:29.367]  So from what you're saying, it sounds like this decision had just as much to do with business as it did with the science.
[03:27:31.741 --> 03:27:37.765]  Well, so it really had a lot to do with what we thought people would be able to tolerate.
[03:27:37.765 --> 03:27:42.767]  We have seen relatively low rates of isolation for all of this pandemic.
[03:27:42.767 --> 03:27:47.230]  Some science has demonstrated less than a third of people are isolating when they need to.
[03:27:47.230 --> 03:27:55.695]  And so we really want to make sure that we had guidance in this moment where we were going to have a lot of disease that could be adhered to, that people were willing to adhere to.
[03:27:56.155 --> 03:28:00.977]  And that spoke specifically to when people were maximally infectious.
[03:28:00.977 --> 03:28:05.720]  So it really spoke to both behaviors as well as what people were able to do.
[03:28:06.721 --> 03:28:20.947]  So you didn't realize that when they said trust the science, what they meant was psychiatry, what they meant was psychology, what they meant was that they have programmed with scientific precision just how far they can push people before everything goes down, right?
[03:28:20.947 --> 03:28:35.534]  That's actually, you didn't realize, that was the science they were talking about, the science of manipulation, the science of psychological subversion, the science of pushing you just far enough without pushing you overboard so they can pull back and get you comfortable again and then hit you again.
[03:28:36.094 --> 03:28:36.415]  Hit you.
[03:28:36.415 --> 03:28:37.936]  You know, kind of like an abusive relationship.
[03:28:37.936 --> 03:28:46.444]  Kind of like when an abuser abuses his girl and then later is so loving to her, it throws her into a sense of confusion and she doesn't know what to do.
[03:28:46.444 --> 03:28:51.648]  It's the same psychological program that wife abusers use on their wife.
[03:28:51.648 --> 03:28:53.370]  It's the government on the people.
[03:28:53.370 --> 03:28:54.211]  It's not that complicated.
[03:28:55.945 --> 03:28:59.647]  Everything I do is about victory for humanity.
[03:28:59.647 --> 03:29:05.511]  Everything I promote is about standing up against the new world order by empowering humanity.
[03:29:05.511 --> 03:29:07.713]  Well, that's why ResetWars.com is so important.
[03:29:07.713 --> 03:29:22.162]  Not only is it a game-changing course of critical information to unlock your mind from the matrix, but it's something that gets around Klaus Schwab's attempt to shut down American infrastructure and American jobs.
[03:29:22.862 --> 03:29:25.085]  It is the true digital economy.
[03:29:25.085 --> 03:29:29.230]  It's the spiritual economy of the mind and transcendental control.
[03:29:30.233 --> 03:29:38.296]  I've been on there 28 years and all of our work has been amazing thanks to God and God's divine empowerment and blessing.
[03:29:38.296 --> 03:29:44.219]  But I got to tell you, out of everything I've done, Reset Wars is the most important and it is now available.
[03:29:44.219 --> 03:29:48.960]  Now the month of December 2021 is here at ResetWars.com.
[03:29:48.960 --> 03:29:53.062]  Start your journey to the next level today at ResetWars.com.
[03:29:53.062 --> 03:29:55.343]  The globalists fear this information.
[03:29:58.140 --> 03:30:00.241]  Get our great, got a bag of it here.
[03:30:00.241 --> 03:30:03.742]  I mean, this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico?
[03:30:03.742 --> 03:30:04.822]  The communists!
[03:30:04.822 --> 03:30:12.185]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested, above organic, in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee.
[03:30:12.185 --> 03:30:17.467]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that, you know, the media calls communists, but really they're just a commune and whatever.
[03:30:17.467 --> 03:30:22.188]  The point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[03:30:22.188 --> 03:30:26.510]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for, what, 14 years and the price has never gone up.
[03:30:26.570 --> 03:30:33.415]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound, and I just think it's some of the best coffee you're gonna find anywhere.
[03:30:33.415 --> 03:30:37.599]  It's Wake Up America Patriot Blend from its Yabba's Rebels, literally.
[03:30:37.599 --> 03:30:40.681]  Um, in fact, I'm not gonna tell you the whole story.
[03:30:40.681 --> 03:30:44.004]  Um... Yeah, I'd like to.
[03:30:44.004 --> 03:30:44.985]  You wouldn't believe it.
[03:30:44.985 --> 03:30:51.370]  Anyway, so, it's InfoWarsTore.com, and that's how we fund this operation, and if you don't fund us or don't want us here, that's fine.
[03:30:57.907 --> 03:30:59.589]  This is a great sponsor.
[03:30:59.589 --> 03:31:04.997]  We have one of the best deals you're going to find out there on a high-quality, high-rated satellite phone.
[03:31:04.997 --> 03:31:09.703]  So you can't be tracked, you can't be traced, and it'll work anywhere in the world where you can see the sky.
[03:31:09.703 --> 03:31:12.687]  You can also buy cheap antennas and things for in your car, in your house.
[03:31:12.947 --> 03:31:15.909]  Also, we're on the site, InfoWarsPhone.com.
[03:31:15.909 --> 03:31:17.410]  That's just a site that takes you to these folks.
[03:31:17.410 --> 03:31:20.211]  They supply the board for everybody with their systems as well.
[03:31:20.211 --> 03:31:28.476]  They're amazing folks, and you get a free phone, a $650 value, absolutely free, at InfoWarsPhone.com.
[03:31:28.476 --> 03:31:30.657]  Smartphones are always tracking everything you do.
[03:31:30.657 --> 03:31:31.137]  These aren't.
[03:31:31.137 --> 03:31:33.098]  And the calls are free when folks call you.
[03:31:33.098 --> 03:31:34.759]  You just pay $99.95 a month for your minutes.
[03:31:36.600 --> 03:31:37.141]  150 minutes.
[03:31:37.141 --> 03:31:39.003]  The calls you receive are free.
[03:31:39.003 --> 03:31:40.204]  It works like a regular cell phone.
[03:31:40.204 --> 03:31:41.526]  You're not being tracked or traced.
[03:31:41.526 --> 03:31:42.807]  And I keep one in my car.
[03:31:42.807 --> 03:31:44.650]  I've given them to my parents as gifts.
[03:31:44.650 --> 03:31:47.052]  Way out in the middle of nowhere where regular phones don't work, they work.
[03:31:47.052 --> 03:31:48.774]  Infowarsphone.com or 941-955-1020.
[03:31:48.774 --> 03:31:49.896]  941-955-1020 and ask the Alex Jones Special.
[03:31:56.808 --> 03:31:58.629]  2021 has been an incredible year.
[03:31:58.629 --> 03:32:03.609]  It's been an incredible year for evil, but it's also been an amazing year for the global awakening.
[03:32:03.609 --> 03:32:05.630]  It's hard to believe it's almost over.
[03:32:05.630 --> 03:32:12.291]  Christmas 2021 is now a thing of history, and we are plunging into the most critical year, not just in U.S.
[03:32:12.291 --> 03:32:14.772]  history, but world history, in my view.
[03:32:14.772 --> 03:32:17.572]  So please continue to spread the word about InfoWars.
[03:32:17.572 --> 03:32:21.853]  Please continue to pray for the broadcast, because all of us together, including you, the viewers and listeners,
[03:32:22.333 --> 03:32:29.017]  Fire the tip of the spear and take advantage of Christmas sales that will end Thursday morning.
[03:32:29.017 --> 03:32:31.778]  I'm cutting this on Tuesday morning.
[03:32:31.778 --> 03:32:41.284]  This is only going to run until Thursday morning and the sale will end up to 60% off, double Patriot points and free shipping at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:32:41.284 --> 03:32:48.588]  So thanks for keeping us on the air while getting great products at the same time like Vitamineral Fusion, DNA Force Plus, Ultimate Bone Broth Formula,
[03:32:49.148 --> 03:32:49.248]  1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4...
[03:33:10.609 --> 03:33:12.451]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:33:12.451 --> 03:33:13.152]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:13.152 --> 03:33:13.933]  My name's Harrison Smith.
[03:33:13.933 --> 03:33:18.039]  I'm the host of the American Journal each and every weekday morning, 8 to 11 a.m.
[03:33:18.039 --> 03:33:19.321]  It's our call-in show.
[03:33:19.321 --> 03:33:21.043]  And man, do we get a lot of good calls.
[03:33:21.043 --> 03:33:25.068]  I try to take as many calls as possible, but it's difficult because they're so good!
[03:33:25.869 --> 03:33:46.665]  Caller calls in he takes up the whole segment and like I want to hear more from him So it's really fun hearing from all the info warriors out there, and you guys are so on top of things It's it's really kind of intimidating sometimes not sure if I'm worthy and you know I always hear Alex Jones say that like I'm not worthy to be bringing you this information And it didn't it didn't really click until somewhat recently when you really stop to understand
[03:33:47.225 --> 03:34:07.284]  What's actually going on, and of course, Alex and his guests are talking about RFK Jr., the book he wrote, The Real Anthony Fauci, I've been seeing rave reviews about that, and that's one where you go, okay, now, it's not just that Anthony Fauci and Bill Gates are kind of weird, creepy, you know, control freaks, no, no, they're mass murderers, and like, it's not, it's, you can't deny it!
[03:34:07.284 --> 03:34:08.766]  It's absolutely true!
[03:34:08.766 --> 03:34:10.667]  It's proven, he brings receipts, I mean, it's...
[03:34:11.678 --> 03:34:17.002]  It's there, and so you really... I'm not... Am I worthy to bring you this information?
[03:34:17.002 --> 03:34:20.885]  Am I really the one who has to be up here trying to get this across?
[03:34:20.885 --> 03:34:23.426]  Could somebody else other than me do it better?
[03:34:23.426 --> 03:34:24.787]  Because that's the point, right?
[03:34:24.787 --> 03:34:26.308]  The point is getting this information across.
[03:34:26.308 --> 03:34:29.491]  The point is getting this information to the largest crowd as possible, and of course,
[03:34:30.191 --> 03:34:32.533]  The Infowarriors are a huge part of that, sharing the links.
[03:34:32.533 --> 03:34:35.115]  It's up to you to get around the censorship and all that.
[03:34:35.115 --> 03:34:47.385]  But of course what starts here, maybe starts with the Infowars audience, as large as it is, it's still not the mass media, you know, reach that so many others have, but Dr. Peter McCullough going on Joe Rogan Show.
[03:34:47.385 --> 03:34:51.989]  Little Birdies tweeting about Robert Malone going on the Rogan Show.
[03:34:51.989 --> 03:34:52.390]  So much
[03:34:53.575 --> 03:34:53.895]  I think?
[03:35:16.408 --> 03:35:21.274]  It's been an incredible honor for me to at least play some part in this global awakening.
[03:35:21.274 --> 03:35:22.736]  It really is happening.
[03:35:22.736 --> 03:35:22.996]  Of course...
[03:35:23.982 --> 03:35:26.443]  Humans have a fatal flaw, I'm figuring out.
[03:35:26.443 --> 03:35:28.024]  Apparently we don't have memories.
[03:35:28.024 --> 03:35:35.788]  I always thought it was normal for people, because I can remember things that happened in January of last year, but apparently nobody else can.
[03:35:35.788 --> 03:35:38.950]  Apparently I'm the only one that remembers what happened last year.
[03:35:38.950 --> 03:35:49.636]  Because you remember around January of last year, it was the Biden COVID miracle, where they came out literally an hour after Joe Biden got inaugurated and said, oh, it turns out the PCR test
[03:35:50.476 --> 03:35:52.397]  Totally doesn't work, actually.
[03:35:52.397 --> 03:35:54.238]  It's, whoops, our bad.
[03:35:54.238 --> 03:36:00.840]  But now that Joe Biden's in office, I think we'd like to come out and let you know the PCR tests can't differentiate between the flu and COVID.
[03:36:00.840 --> 03:36:02.161]  And yeah, that's why.
[03:36:02.161 --> 03:36:04.402]  That's why flu took a vacation last year.
[03:36:04.402 --> 03:36:05.642]  This is how absurd you...
[03:36:07.281 --> 03:36:10.364]  This is how stupid they think you are, I should say, the mainstream media.
[03:36:10.364 --> 03:36:16.209]  They literally are writing in their mainstream articles, the flu took a year off in 2021.
[03:36:16.209 --> 03:36:19.332]  As if diseases take a gap year every once in a while.
[03:36:19.332 --> 03:36:21.574]  It was backpacking around Europe.
[03:36:21.574 --> 03:36:23.716]  It took a year off, folks.
[03:36:23.716 --> 03:36:24.797]  Do you believe that?
[03:36:25.297 --> 03:36:28.179]  Or are you insulted by these things that they tell you?
[03:36:28.179 --> 03:36:32.221]  These blatant, obvious lies that they try to get across?
[03:36:32.221 --> 03:36:33.082]  No, it's absurd.
[03:36:33.082 --> 03:36:34.163]  So, it's happening again.
[03:36:34.163 --> 03:36:35.483]  It's happening again.
[03:36:35.483 --> 03:36:38.005]  It's been about a year, but the COVID miracle is happening.
[03:36:38.005 --> 03:36:43.348]  Remember, Andrew Cuomo opened up New York a week before the inauguration happened.
[03:36:43.348 --> 03:36:47.671]  Gavin Newsom opened up California the day after the inauguration happened.
[03:36:47.671 --> 03:36:52.314]  The PCR test and many other things that suddenly were reversed as soon as Joe Biden was in office.
[03:36:52.314 --> 03:36:53.214]  Oh gosh, turns out the
[03:36:54.215 --> 03:36:57.621]  The whole thing wasn't nearly as bad as we thought it was going to be.
[03:36:57.621 --> 03:37:01.567]  So, sorry about that, but now that politically it's played its part, we can move on.
[03:37:01.567 --> 03:37:03.110]  I think that's what's happening here.
[03:37:03.695 --> 03:37:05.156]  Let me just read a few articles here.
[03:37:05.156 --> 03:37:11.561]  First from the Wall Street Journal, CDC's early COVID-19 tests hampered by design flaw and contamination.
[03:37:11.561 --> 03:37:13.762]  Oh dear, who would have thought?
[03:37:13.762 --> 03:37:20.247]  CDC's investigation concluded that a section of some of the tests were contaminated with a synthetic piece of genetic material.
[03:37:20.247 --> 03:37:30.695]  Because of a design flaw, components of another part of the test sometimes interacted together and triggered false positives, according to results of an investigation published Wednesday in the scientific journal PLOS.
[03:37:32.236 --> 03:37:34.397]  Uh, to what percentage?
[03:37:34.397 --> 03:37:35.898]  Could these have been, uh, positive results?
[03:37:35.898 --> 03:37:42.522]  Well, according to the Wall Street Journal, the false positive rate in the third section of the test was 97%, investigators wrote.
[03:37:42.522 --> 03:37:47.125]  They found the two components would unintentionally combine together and register a positive result.
[03:37:47.125 --> 03:37:48.125]  Oh, whoopsies!
[03:37:48.125 --> 03:37:48.926]  Whoopsie daisy!
[03:37:48.926 --> 03:37:53.128]  Sorry, our bad, just, you know, global pandemic, lockdown, destroying the economy, destroying
[03:37:53.428 --> 03:38:01.817]  Just millions of small businesses, lives, you know, driving 900,000 people into poverty in the UK alone, starvation already starting in the third world, are bad.
[03:38:01.817 --> 03:38:06.982]  You'd think we would have tested the test first, but no, no, it's all just flying by the seat of our pants.
[03:38:08.308 --> 03:38:15.032]  You know, the only real reasonable options you're left with is these people are either grossly incompetent or evil.
[03:38:15.032 --> 03:38:17.033]  And I think I know where I land on that decision.
[03:38:17.033 --> 03:38:18.514]  These people are scumbags.
[03:38:18.514 --> 03:38:27.380]  On Wednesday, Walensky acknowledged the CDC's decision to alter the recommended isolation period really had a lot to do with what we thought people were able to tolerate.
[03:38:27.380 --> 03:38:29.761]  Yes, it's all about psychological manipulation.
[03:38:29.761 --> 03:38:31.202]  I guess they're just coming out with that now.
[03:38:32.648 --> 03:38:32.728]  And
[03:38:53.140 --> 03:38:53.881]  They just change it.
[03:38:53.881 --> 03:38:55.303]  It's just all arbitrary.
[03:38:55.303 --> 03:38:56.023]  It's all capricious.
[03:38:56.023 --> 03:38:57.245]  It's all just at a whim.
[03:38:57.245 --> 03:39:08.661]  The new CDC guidance does not require individuals at the end of their isolation period to test negative for COVID-19 because they say the rapid antigen tests actually pick up
[03:39:10.538 --> 03:39:10.939]  I don't know.
[03:39:27.878 --> 03:39:28.658]  How about this?
[03:39:28.658 --> 03:39:39.664]  After December 31st, 2021, the CDC will withdraw the request to the FDA for emergency use authorization of the PCR diagnostic panel.
[03:39:39.664 --> 03:39:49.369]  They say, in preparation for this change, CDC recommends clinical laboratories and testing sites that have been using the PCR test begin their transition to another FDA-authorized COVID-19 test.
[03:39:50.109 --> 03:39:59.632]  They encourage laboratories to consider adoption of a multiplex method that can facilitate detection and differentiation of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses.
[03:39:59.632 --> 03:40:07.434]  Yeah, you know, two years after the start of the pandemic, maybe now's the time to have a test that actually differentiates between COVID and the flu.
[03:40:07.434 --> 03:40:08.794]  Wouldn't that be convenient?
[03:40:08.794 --> 03:40:11.155]  I mean, so I guess COVID just really is the flu.
[03:40:11.155 --> 03:40:14.816]  It really was just the flu for like a huge portion of the positive tests.
[03:40:15.356 --> 03:40:17.537]  That said, you had COVID, you actually had the flu.
[03:40:17.537 --> 03:40:19.357]  I mean, I guess that's what they're saying, right?
[03:40:19.357 --> 03:40:24.579]  Because that's what I'm reading, and I can read and understand things, so I think I get it.
[03:40:24.579 --> 03:40:27.700]  I think I understand what's going on here.
[03:40:27.700 --> 03:40:38.664]  So they're changing things with absolute impunity, acting as if we didn't know all of this before, and somehow trying to make this seem like we're all coming to this realization at the same time.
[03:40:38.664 --> 03:40:42.285]  No, we've all been on this side for a while now, and you're just
[03:40:44.338 --> 03:40:47.701]  Trying to make it seem like you aren't world-destroying psychopaths.
[03:40:47.701 --> 03:40:51.104]  But we know better, because we've been paying attention the entire time.
[03:40:51.104 --> 03:40:54.067]  And I swear, we need- I really do- We're gonna do it.
[03:40:54.067 --> 03:40:56.629]  I'm gonna get a big jar, the Alex Jones is right jar.
[03:40:56.629 --> 03:40:58.351]  It's not a meme, it's the reality.
[03:40:59.585 --> 03:41:02.328]  Because just like any murder investigation, I've talked about this before, right?
[03:41:02.328 --> 03:41:08.313]  If you're investigating a murder and somebody says, yeah, yeah, on Tuesday I went to Wendy's, but really they went to McDonald's, that's a major red flag.
[03:41:08.313 --> 03:41:09.214]  It's a major red flag.
[03:41:09.214 --> 03:41:15.520]  Any lie like that in one of these major investigations, it's a major red flag because you don't just lie to lie.
[03:41:15.700 --> 03:41:17.621]  These people weren't just wrong by accident.
[03:41:17.621 --> 03:41:18.861]  They lie because they're hiding something.
[03:41:18.861 --> 03:41:20.382]  They're hiding their real intentions.
[03:41:20.382 --> 03:41:26.664]  They're hiding what they know to be true because they have some sort of ulterior motive for the information they're sharing.
[03:41:26.664 --> 03:41:27.525]  And that's the reality.
[03:41:27.525 --> 03:41:29.725]  And so what we expose to you isn't necessarily the lies.
[03:41:29.725 --> 03:41:33.887]  You should be able to see that for yourself because you've got a brain in your head.
[03:41:33.887 --> 03:41:35.768]  But what we're here is to try to explain
[03:41:36.388 --> 03:41:39.912]  What the purpose of the lies are, and what they're concealing, and what the reality is.
[03:41:39.912 --> 03:41:42.234]  I hope you support us by going to infowarestore.com.
[03:41:42.234 --> 03:41:43.495]  New Year's is right around the corner.
[03:41:43.495 --> 03:41:47.219]  Make sure you are well and prepared for your New Year's resolutions.
[03:41:47.219 --> 03:41:49.281]  Get some of the supplements that will help you carry them out.
[03:41:49.281 --> 03:41:52.023]  Want to try to fall asleep earlier in the New Year?
[03:41:52.023 --> 03:41:52.644]  Try knockout.
[03:41:52.644 --> 03:41:53.324]  Try down and out.
[03:41:53.324 --> 03:41:54.446]  You want to wake up earlier?
[03:41:55.046 --> 03:41:56.847]  Heck, try Turbo Force.
[03:41:56.847 --> 03:41:58.889]  Try the Wake Up America coffee.
[03:41:58.889 --> 03:41:59.649]  Alex doesn't talk about it.
[03:41:59.649 --> 03:42:01.350]  The t-shirts are $10, folks.
[03:42:01.350 --> 03:42:06.474]  The t-shirts are $10 on InfoWars store and you're getting free shipping and double patriot points.
[03:42:06.474 --> 03:42:07.775]  You're practically robbing us.
[03:42:07.775 --> 03:42:12.438]  This is an invitation to steal from InfoWars because we're selling $10 shirts.
[03:42:12.438 --> 03:42:13.839]  I don't understand how they're that cheap.
[03:42:13.839 --> 03:42:14.860]  I don't get economics, but
[03:42:15.140 --> 03:42:16.381]  Hey, they're available.
[03:42:16.381 --> 03:42:17.041]  Go pick them up.
[03:42:17.041 --> 03:42:19.542]  They're some of the finest t-shirts man has ever made.
[03:42:19.542 --> 03:42:21.023]  They last for years and years and years.
[03:42:21.023 --> 03:42:24.164]  I still wear ones that I bought seven years ago on a regular basis.
[03:42:24.164 --> 03:42:25.184]  They aren't faded.
[03:42:25.184 --> 03:42:25.885]  They aren't ripped.
[03:42:25.885 --> 03:42:27.626]  They've really just gotten softer over time.
[03:42:27.626 --> 03:42:28.206]  They're incredible.
[03:42:28.206 --> 03:42:37.350]  But of course, the supplements are bombshell and incredible, and you really will benefit from them, especially if you're trying to fulfill some health-related New Year's resolutions.
[03:42:37.350 --> 03:42:39.411]  Now's the time to take advantage of the Christmas sale because
[03:42:40.091 --> 03:42:43.133]  Stocks are running out fast and the sale won't last forever.
[03:42:43.133 --> 03:42:49.296]  And of course, COVID land is the physical copy of the information that destroys the New World Order.
[03:42:49.296 --> 03:42:51.157]  And when you get it, you get two DVDs.
[03:42:51.157 --> 03:42:55.120]  In addition, the dark secrets of the Bohemian Grove inside Bohemia.
[03:42:56.204 --> 03:43:01.727]  I'm cutting this announcement on the morning of December 28th, 2021.
[03:43:01.727 --> 03:43:10.192]  And that means you've only got until Thursday morning, or less than two days, to take advantage of the biggest sales of 2021.
[03:43:10.192 --> 03:43:18.956]  Up to 60% off on our best-selling products, double Patriot Points, and store-wide free shipping.
[03:43:18.956 --> 03:43:22.698]  DNA Force Plus is about to go off sale.
[03:43:22.698 --> 03:43:25.120]  VitaMineral Fusion is about to go off sale.
[03:43:25.928 --> 03:43:30.071]  Ultimate Bone Broth that we finally got reformulated back in stock.
[03:43:30.071 --> 03:43:37.615]  It is going to be ending its sale along with more than 50 other products at InfoWarsTore.com and the free shipping.
[03:43:37.615 --> 03:43:44.300]  So you've got until Thursday to get the best deals of 2021 and they're gone, they're over.
[03:43:44.300 --> 03:43:48.382]  We were going to run them through to the new year, but most of these products have almost sold out.
[03:43:48.382 --> 03:43:49.563]  A lot have already sold out.
[03:43:49.563 --> 03:43:50.744]  So thanks for keeping us on the air.
[03:43:50.744 --> 03:43:51.764]  These are great products.
[03:43:51.764 --> 03:43:53.826]  It's a win-win InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:43:55.819 --> 03:43:58.040]  Why do my enemies hate me so much?
[03:43:58.040 --> 03:43:59.641]  Why do the globalists hate you so much?
[03:43:59.641 --> 03:44:02.503]  Why do they hate America so much?
[03:44:02.503 --> 03:44:09.587]  Because it's an idea of freedom that their tyrannical system that they're pushing cannot coexist with.
[03:44:09.587 --> 03:44:10.887]  It's very, very simple.
[03:44:10.887 --> 03:44:22.754]  For their world government, their anti-human, post-human, eugenic system to flourish, freedom and liberty and due process injustice and God-fearing systems must fail.
[03:44:23.534 --> 03:44:26.076]  So sure, you didn't start a fight with Bill Gates.
[03:44:26.076 --> 03:44:29.039]  You didn't start a fight with David Rockefeller.
[03:44:29.039 --> 03:44:30.980]  You didn't start a fight with the UN.
[03:44:30.980 --> 03:44:34.003]  They started a fight with you.
[03:44:34.003 --> 03:44:42.430]  And they're not gonna back down, and they're not gonna go away, and they're not going to ever stop their attacks until they have the fear of God put into them.
[03:44:43.190 --> 03:44:48.833]  The average person still doesn't even know about the New World Order, or about globalism, or about corporate fascism.
[03:44:48.833 --> 03:44:54.435]  And it's not until people understand that, and that we're under attack, that we have any chance of beating these people.
[03:44:56.544 --> 03:44:58.365]  2021 has been an incredible year.
[03:44:58.365 --> 03:45:03.367]  It's been an incredible year for evil, but it's also been an amazing year for the global awakening.
[03:45:03.367 --> 03:45:05.388]  It's hard to believe it's almost over.
[03:45:05.388 --> 03:45:12.032]  Christmas 2021 is now a thing of history, and we are plunging into the most critical year, not just in U.S.
[03:45:12.032 --> 03:45:14.513]  history, but world history in my view.
[03:45:14.513 --> 03:45:17.315]  So please continue to spread the word about InfoWars.
[03:45:17.315 --> 03:45:21.597]  Please continue to pray for the broadcast, because all of us together, including you, the viewers and listeners,
[03:45:22.137 --> 03:45:22.377]  I think?
[03:45:37.725 --> 03:45:37.985]  I think so.
[03:45:55.979 --> 03:45:56.980]  Ultimate Bone Broth
[03:46:13.081 --> 03:46:22.289]  It's got concentrated high-quality chicken broth protein, turmeric root that's so amazing, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder.
[03:46:22.289 --> 03:46:25.731]  Then it's got added magnesium and potassium for electrolytes.
[03:46:25.731 --> 03:46:32.257]  It's got real organic cocoa bean powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of sea salt.
[03:46:32.257 --> 03:46:34.199]  It even tastes better than the last formula.
[03:46:34.199 --> 03:46:36.681]  And what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[03:46:36.681 --> 03:46:38.082]  Again, it has that cutting edge.
[03:46:38.542 --> 03:46:44.106]  Chicken broth, protein, isolate powder for better flavor and dissolvability.
[03:46:44.106 --> 03:46:48.249]  You're gonna love this and what it does for your joints, what it does for your body, what it does for your bones.
[03:46:48.249 --> 03:46:51.031]  It's simply amazing and it helps fund the InfoWar.
[03:46:51.031 --> 03:46:57.376]  This is really the best bone broth out there, so get yours at InfoWarStore.com today.
[03:46:57.376 --> 03:47:03.260]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:08.723 --> 03:47:12.345]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:12.345 --> 03:47:13.226]  My name's Harrison Smith.
[03:47:13.226 --> 03:47:15.247]  This is our final segment with you.
[03:47:15.247 --> 03:47:16.528]  Man, time flies.
[03:47:16.528 --> 03:47:22.251]  I've been thinking, you know, a whole hour, gosh, I'll cover stuff about the Fed, I'll cover stuff about transgenderism.
[03:47:22.251 --> 03:47:25.834]  No, all we have time to do is to destroy the
[03:47:27.199 --> 03:47:30.501]  So-called scientific basis of all of these changes that they're making.
[03:47:30.501 --> 03:47:34.243]  But luckily, there's so much more to find on Ban.Video and InfoWars.com.
[03:47:34.243 --> 03:47:35.703]  The news never stops, folks.
[03:47:35.703 --> 03:47:38.905]  And of course, it's all brought to you by InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:47:38.905 --> 03:47:50.011]  I really try very hard, and it's difficult, I'll tell you what, to avoid any sort of drama in the right-wing-go sphere of commentary, the dissident right over here.
[03:47:50.011 --> 03:47:53.312]  But, you know, every once in a while, something happens.
[03:47:53.312 --> 03:47:54.073]  I'm not even going to comment.
[03:47:54.993 --> 03:47:56.334]  All I'll say is this.
[03:47:56.334 --> 03:47:57.634]  InfoWars is the real deal.
[03:47:57.634 --> 03:48:06.137]  A lot of right-wing grifters get exposed and are being exposed for being absolutely nothing like the person that they portray.
[03:48:06.137 --> 03:48:08.498]  I hope you understand if you're a regular viewer of InfoWars.
[03:48:08.498 --> 03:48:09.939]  Everything we do here is off the cuff.
[03:48:09.939 --> 03:48:13.060]  Everything we do here is as real as it can possibly be.
[03:48:13.940 --> 03:48:14.140]  Right?
[03:48:14.140 --> 03:48:15.981]  And I think, I think you understand that.
[03:48:15.981 --> 03:48:23.765]  And, uh, I always just think it's hilarious when, uh, left-wing activist groups are like, activist hackers are gonna find the secrets of the right wing.
[03:48:23.765 --> 03:48:25.926]  And it's like, oh no!
[03:48:25.926 --> 03:48:26.366]  Oh dear!
[03:48:26.366 --> 03:48:29.388]  Oh no, they're gonna find my short films from high school, maybe.
[03:48:29.388 --> 03:48:30.368]  Like, there's no dirt.
[03:48:30.368 --> 03:48:32.009]  There's no dirt to find.
[03:48:32.009 --> 03:48:33.270]  There's no ulterior motives.
[03:48:33.270 --> 03:48:34.570]  There's no secret funding.
[03:48:34.570 --> 03:48:35.391]  It doesn't exist.
[03:48:35.391 --> 03:48:38.312]  All of our funding is InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:48:38.312 --> 03:48:41.174]  All of our information is right here in front of your face.
[03:48:41.174 --> 03:48:43.115]  All of our personality and our, our,
[03:48:44.309 --> 03:49:00.439]  Mindset everything is on the table for you to see and and I think that's one thing that Attracts people to InfoWars and makes it so easy to be here because I don't have to play a part I don't have to pretend to be something I'm not all I am is outraged at the insane nonsense going on on a continual basis around the world and
[03:49:00.939 --> 03:49:03.340]  Here I have a platform to pontificate on it.
[03:49:03.340 --> 03:49:05.620]  I thank you so much for that honor and privilege.
[03:49:05.620 --> 03:49:14.463]  Please go to InfoWarsStore.com to keep us on the air and help us to expand Banned.Video as we're bringing on more and more producers, more and more reporters and investigators.
[03:49:14.463 --> 03:49:23.726]  It's growing and growing and really becoming a true juggernaut of truth plowing through the ranks of misinformation that assault us on a continual basis.
[03:49:24.690 --> 03:49:28.731]  Now, of course, big news is that Dr. Robert Malone has been suspended from Twitter.
[03:49:28.731 --> 03:49:29.851]  He's not the only one, though.
[03:49:29.851 --> 03:49:35.373]  Twitter suspended just the news founder for a report on the legal distinctions between the COVID vaccine.
[03:49:35.373 --> 03:49:37.114]  So they're doing a big purge right now.
[03:49:37.114 --> 03:49:41.595]  I want to take a moment to play a video that we believe to be the video that got Robert Malone.
[03:49:42.455 --> 03:49:44.136]  Suspended off of Twitter.
[03:49:44.136 --> 03:49:45.597]  The whole thing's about 40 minutes long.
[03:49:45.597 --> 03:49:48.880]  It's by the Canadian COVID Care Alliance.
[03:49:48.880 --> 03:49:53.563]  I've retweeted a link to it if you want to share the full thing, and I encourage you to do so and watch the whole thing.
[03:49:53.563 --> 03:49:59.967]  But I want to play at least the first five minutes of it here, because it's very, very powerful information all on its own.
[03:49:59.967 --> 03:50:06.131]  Powerful enough to get the inventor of the mRNA technology kicked off of Twitter permanently.
[03:50:06.131 --> 03:50:07.793]  And here it is.
[03:50:07.793 --> 03:50:08.213]  Let's watch.
[03:50:09.329 --> 03:50:09.989]  We're good to go.
[03:50:24.998 --> 03:50:25.899]  We're good to go.
[03:50:48.872 --> 03:50:52.416]  It's important to understand the hierarchy of scientific evidence.
[03:50:52.416 --> 03:50:58.262]  When you're talking about proving things to be either safe or harmful, you need to rely on the best evidence.
[03:50:58.262 --> 03:51:06.030]  As you can see from the table on the right, a randomized control trial is level one evidence, the highest form of evidence there is.
[03:51:06.030 --> 03:51:10.555]  It's considered the gold standard, and it's the only way to prove that something is true.
[03:51:11.175 --> 03:51:20.666]  Models, which we've heard a lot of during the pandemic, are actually the lowest form of evidence, level 5 or lower, as they're considered to be expert opinion or speculation.
[03:51:20.666 --> 03:51:25.391]  Policy should always be determined by the highest level of evidence available, which is level 1.
[03:51:26.032 --> 03:51:32.356]  So first, we're going to talk about Pfizer's original trial report that came out on December 31, 2020.
[03:51:32.356 --> 03:51:37.720]  It was published in the New England Journal of Medicine, and it showed two months' worth of safety and efficacy data.
[03:51:37.720 --> 03:51:46.886]  It described how the trial started, with over 43,000 people divided into a treatment group and a control group, and how for two months, they followed them to see who developed COVID-19.
[03:51:46.886 --> 03:51:53.250]  The report claimed that the inoculations were safe and showed 95% efficacy seven days after the second dose.
[03:51:53.530 --> 03:51:56.912]  But that 95% was actually relative risk reduction.
[03:51:56.912 --> 03:52:00.534]  Absolute risk reduction was only 0.84%.
[03:52:00.534 --> 03:52:07.018]  Many people don't know the difference between relative and absolute risk reduction, so we're just going to show you what that means.
[03:52:07.018 --> 03:52:11.001]  Pfizer reported that its vaccine shows a 95% efficacy.
[03:52:11.001 --> 03:52:14.283]  That sounds like it protects you 95% of the time, right?
[03:52:14.283 --> 03:52:17.225]  But that's not actually what that number means.
[03:52:17.225 --> 03:52:18.546]  That 95% refers to the relative risk reduction.
[03:52:20.967 --> 03:52:25.689]  But it doesn't tell you how much your overall risk is reduced by vaccination.
[03:52:25.689 --> 03:52:28.771]  For that, we need absolute risk reduction.
[03:52:28.771 --> 03:52:35.935]  In the Pfizer trial, 8 out of 18,198 people who were given the vaccine developed COVID-19.
[03:52:35.935 --> 03:52:46.040]  In the unvaccinated placebo group, 162 people got it, which means that even without the vaccine, the risk of contracting COVID-19 was extremely low at 0.88%, which the vaccine then reduced to 0.04%.
[03:52:50.382 --> 03:52:55.906]  So net benefit or the absolute risk reduction that you're being offered with a Pfizer vaccine is 0.84%.
[03:52:55.906 --> 03:52:59.508]  That 95% number, that refers to the relative difference between 0.88 and 0.04%.
[03:52:59.508 --> 03:53:01.330]  That's what they call 95% relative risk reduction.
[03:53:09.295 --> 03:53:17.243]  And relative risk reduction is well known to be a misleading number, which is why the FDA recommends using absolute risk reduction instead.
[03:53:17.243 --> 03:53:24.670]  Which begs the question, how many people would have chosen to take the COVID-19 vaccines had they understood that they offered less than 1% benefit?
[03:53:25.991 --> 03:53:32.755]  So the first thing you need to understand about how Pfizer ran this study is that it didn't go according to their stated plan.
[03:53:32.755 --> 03:53:40.400]  There was an inoculated group and a placebo group of about 21,000 participants each, and they began the phase 3 trials in July of 2020.
[03:53:40.400 --> 03:53:44.222]  And the study was blind, which means the participants didn't know which group they were in.
[03:53:44.222 --> 03:53:48.144]  And this blinded trial was supposed to go on for three years until May 2nd of 2023.
[03:53:49.525 --> 03:53:52.407]  That would mark the end of Phase 3 of the clinical trial.
[03:53:52.407 --> 03:53:59.152]  At that point, the trial would be unblinded, which means the placebo group would be offered the intervention if it were indicated and if they consented.
[03:53:59.152 --> 03:54:00.873]  But that's not what happened.
[03:54:00.873 --> 03:54:08.338]  Instead, after they had accumulated and released only two months' worth of trial data, Pfizer unblinded the study, which means they told
[03:54:08.718 --> 03:54:17.223]  All of the placebo and inoculation group participants, which group they were in, and offered the placebo group participants the option of moving over to the inoculated group.
[03:54:17.223 --> 03:54:23.047]  Most of them took Pfizer up on that offer and the vast majority of the placebo group moved into the inoculated group.
[03:54:23.047 --> 03:54:29.891]  Which means that quite early in 2021, there was no longer a control group to compare the inoculated group to.
[03:54:29.891 --> 03:54:35.394]  Which means that for the rest of the trial, there's no way to assess long-term effectiveness or safety.
[03:54:35.814 --> 03:54:41.519]  Now we'll move ahead to Pfizer's 6-month report data, and that came out on September 15th of 2021.
[03:54:41.519 --> 03:54:49.886]  This report indicated an efficacy of 91.3%, which means the inoculated group showed a reduction in positive cases compared to the placebo group.
[03:54:49.886 --> 03:54:54.970]  But shockingly, the inoculated group also showed an increase in illness and deaths.
[03:54:55.390 --> 03:55:02.914]  Now this is a problem because there's no benefit to a reduction in cases if it comes at a cost of increased illness and death.
[03:55:02.914 --> 03:55:07.256]  Let's look first at the increased illness that can be found in the Pfizer trial data.
[03:55:07.256 --> 03:55:17.402]  On the right, you'll see Pfizer's efficacy numbers, which they present quite proudly in their report, and it shows a reduction of positive cases of 91% in favor of the inoculation arm of the trial.
[03:55:17.702 --> 03:55:20.786]  On the left is a table showing the adverse events from the trial.
[03:55:20.786 --> 03:55:23.329]  You won't actually find it in the report itself.
[03:55:23.329 --> 03:55:26.492]  You have to dig into the supplementary appendix in order to find it.
[03:55:26.492 --> 03:55:29.536]  We've included a link to it in the PDF version of this presentation.
[03:55:29.536 --> 03:55:36.925]  And this table is really concerning, because if you recall, the justification for the inoculations was to reduce illness and hospitalization.
[03:55:37.225 --> 03:55:43.650]  Yet here we see that the inoculation arm showed an increase in adverse events in almost every category.
[03:55:43.650 --> 03:55:56.419]  For example, if you look at related adverse events, which are adverse events that the investigators determined to be caused by the investigational product, there were over 5,000 in the experimental arm and just over 1,000 in the placebo group.
[03:55:56.419 --> 03:56:00.002]  So that was a 300% increase for people who'd taken the inoculation.
[03:56:00.402 --> 03:56:11.976]  And when we look at severe adverse events, things that significantly interfere with normal daily function... Alright folks, so we think that this was the video that got Dr. Robert Malone kicked off of Twitter, and you can see why.
[03:56:11.976 --> 03:56:17.663]  It's not because it's misinformation, it's because it destroys their entire narrative, and it's really incredible.
[03:56:17.663 --> 03:56:18.084]  There's 40 minutes!
[03:56:19.185 --> 03:56:22.048]  Of that level of bombshell information, it truly is incredible.
[03:56:22.048 --> 03:56:30.838]  The Canadian COVID Care Alliance, just that little portion at the beginning, just, again, devastates the entire narrative about the vaccine.
[03:56:30.838 --> 03:56:32.580]  And, of course, we can't have that.
[03:56:32.580 --> 03:56:36.464]  We must vaccinate everybody, so eliminate anybody that dares to tell the truth.
[03:56:36.864 --> 03:56:37.305]  That's where we
[03:56:52.785 --> 03:56:53.165]  I think so.
[03:57:16.357 --> 03:57:19.358]  And also you can get the COVID Land The Mask.
[03:57:19.358 --> 03:57:24.040]  That's the second episode of the COVID Land documentary series.
[03:57:24.040 --> 03:57:28.782]  And when you order that, you get Bohemian Grove The Order of Death for free.
[03:57:28.782 --> 03:57:30.903]  Hard copies that they cannot eliminate.
[03:57:30.903 --> 03:57:33.844]  Take it, copy it, share it, burn it, re-upload it.
[03:57:33.844 --> 03:57:35.924]  Do whatever you need to get this information out.
[03:57:35.924 --> 03:57:37.965]  That is what it's all about.
[03:57:37.965 --> 03:57:40.126]  And thank you so much for being here with me today.
[03:57:40.126 --> 03:57:42.127]  The War Room begins in just a minute.
[03:57:42.127 --> 03:57:42.587]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:57:45.612 --> 03:57:48.973]  Not just across the United States, but across the world.
[03:57:48.973 --> 03:57:54.396]  You see it on the sides of barns, and on bumper stickers, on cars, and written on the side of bathroom walls.
[03:57:54.396 --> 03:57:55.996]  Alex Jones was right.
[03:57:55.996 --> 03:58:04.940]  That's become a maxim of people to communicate to others that they see through the fraud of the New World Order, that they're saying no to Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, and the Great Reset.
[03:58:04.940 --> 03:58:08.302]  And so now, InfoWars credibility is stronger than it's ever been.
[03:58:08.942 --> 03:58:14.407]  And the globalists are now coming to try to shut us down after all their other attacks, and we can't let them do that.
[03:58:14.407 --> 03:58:17.109]  So, you've invested in Infowars over the years.
[03:58:17.109 --> 03:58:23.635]  I'm asking you to redouble those efforts now at this critical juncture, or everything you've done in the past is for nothing.
[03:58:24.235 --> 03:58:28.058]  You have invested in justice and the truth and hardcore populace.
[03:58:28.058 --> 03:58:30.279]  You have done incredible things.
[03:58:30.279 --> 03:58:37.925]  And I'm telling you now, going into 2022, InfoWars has major underages to run our operation, and we need more funds in.
[03:58:37.925 --> 03:58:38.625]  So it's a 360 win.
[03:58:38.625 --> 03:58:42.748]  You get great products that are great for you and your family, your immune system, and so much more.

[03:58:55.282 --> 03:58:57.864]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[03:58:57.864 --> 03:58:59.366]  They know you're angry.
[03:58:59.366 --> 03:59:04.229]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.
