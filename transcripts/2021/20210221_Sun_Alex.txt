[00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:14.639]  The image of this airplane's engine burning in flight is quite the allegory for this very moment in time for the United States of America.
[00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:23.469]  After his first month as president, Joe Biden has canceled the Keystone Pipeline, terminating thousands of jobs and raising fuel prices.
[00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.734]  Suspended protection of our bulk power grid, which has already been infiltrated by the CCP.
[00:00:30.255 --> 00:00:37.580]  Nodded presidential support for the CCP's strong arming of Hong Kong, Chinese death camps, and the Uyghur genocide.
[00:00:38.361 --> 00:00:42.104]  Rejoined the Paris Climate Accord to further destroy U.S.
[00:00:42.204 --> 00:00:45.667]  industry while China's industry burns at full throttle.
[00:00:46.127 --> 00:00:51.131]  And rejoined the CCP-run World Health Organization, pushing the COVID-19 hoax.
[00:00:52.472 --> 00:00:55.695]  The federal government has completely fallen to the CCP.
[00:00:56.255 --> 00:00:58.477]  America has lost one of its engines.
[00:00:58.978 --> 00:01:06.304]  It is now up to our one remaining engine, the states, to pull us up before we crash, or at the very least, give us a good landing.
[00:01:14.199 --> 00:01:25.756]  Section 4 of the 25th Amendment empowers the Vice President and a majority of the President's Cabinet to determine that the President is no longer fit to serve as President.
[00:01:26.077 --> 00:01:28.200]  It was attempted on President Trump in 2017.
[00:01:29.722 --> 00:01:44.057]  A discussion of the 25th Amendment was simply, Rod raised the issue and discussed it with me in the context of thinking about how many other cabinet officials might support such an effort.
[00:01:44.534 --> 00:01:55.468]  Well I've been speaking out about the invocation of the 25th amendment since early this year because I do think the president is not equipped to do the job.
[00:01:55.628 --> 00:01:57.731]  And recently after the Capitol riot.
[00:01:57.951 --> 00:02:01.055]  And I don't know where his cabinet has been all this time but
[00:02:01.525 --> 00:02:08.028]  It's long overdue for the 25th Amendment because this man is no longer capable of serving the United States of America.
[00:02:08.328 --> 00:02:11.670]  Of course, Trump's mental fitness wasn't the real issue.
[00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:18.253]  It was his pro-America rhetoric that drove the Democrats to abuse Section 4 of the 25th Amendment.
[00:02:18.413 --> 00:02:24.896]  President Donald Trump, who tweeted, quote, Crazy Nancy is the one who should be under observation.
[00:02:24.956 --> 00:02:26.857]  They don't call her crazy for nothing.
[00:02:26.957 --> 00:02:34.502]  But when it comes to mental fitness, Biden has in just one month proven he is out to lunch and a prime candidate.
[00:02:35.022 --> 00:02:39.204]  We expect these additional 200 million doses to be delivered this summer.
[00:02:40.045 --> 00:02:48.210]  And some of it will come as early, begin to come in early summer, but by the mid, by the mid summer that this vaccine will be there.
[00:02:49.219 --> 00:03:00.348]  And the order, and that increases the total vaccine order in the United States by 50% from 400 million order to 600 million.
[00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:04.431]  This is enough vaccine to fully vaccinate 300 Americans.
[00:03:06.181 --> 00:03:09.323]  By end of the summer, the beginning of the fall.
[00:03:09.563 --> 00:03:17.568]  It's clear to me at the least that US President Joe Biden is struggling with dementia and is clearly not up to the task he's been sworn in to do.
[00:03:17.588 --> 00:03:26.434]  It was quite telling that while President Biden was playing Mario Kart and napping all of last weekend, apparently he had no official duties.
[00:03:27.114 --> 00:03:31.197]  His ambitious deputy Kamala Harris was telephoning foreign leaders.
[00:03:31.777 --> 00:03:37.401]  Biden started off by excusing the genocide against the Uyghur people by the Chinese Communist Party.
[00:03:37.761 --> 00:03:41.064]  He dismissed it as just Chinese cultural norms.
[00:03:41.464 --> 00:03:48.149]  The central principle of Xi Jinping is that there must be a united, tightly controlled China.
[00:03:48.982 --> 00:03:52.503]  And he uses his rationale for the things he does based on that.
[00:03:52.963 --> 00:03:59.564]  I point out to him, no American president can be sustained as a president if he doesn't reflect the values of the United States.
[00:04:00.024 --> 00:04:15.548]  And so the idea, I'm not going to speak out against what he's doing in Hong Kong, what he's doing with the Uyghurs in western mountains of China, and Taiwan trying to end the one China policy by making it forceful.
[00:04:16.428 --> 00:04:19.389]  I said, but he said, he gets it.
[00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:26.051]  Culturally there are different norms at each country and their leaders are expected to follow.
[00:04:26.451 --> 00:04:34.113]  But then he went on to suggest that blacks, Hispanics and people who live in the country aren't really smart enough to get online.
[00:04:35.785 --> 00:04:37.505]  A lot of people don't know how to register.
[00:04:37.565 --> 00:04:48.088]  Not everybody in the community, in the Hispanic and the African American community, particularly in rural areas that are distant and or inner city.
[00:04:48.408 --> 00:04:50.048]  That's just part of the report.
[00:04:50.088 --> 00:04:53.929]  See the same entire report at BAN.VIDEO and share it.
[00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:54.910]  It's titled 21st Amendment.
[00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.270]  It's inevitable for Biden.
[00:04:58.024 --> 00:04:59.286]  Mainstream media.
[00:05:00.348 --> 00:05:01.490]  Government cover-ups.
[00:05:02.131 --> 00:05:03.593]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:05:04.214 --> 00:05:05.476]  Well, so does he.
[00:05:06.357 --> 00:05:11.064]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:26.671]  We are witnessing the scientific, premeditated, corporate, global government-directed dismantlement of the United States of America as we know it because a private corporate tyranny is being set up.
[00:05:27.332 --> 00:05:33.533]  They don't want uppity Americans that have due process, that have a right to self-defense, a right to private property, a right to travel.
[00:05:33.613 --> 00:05:36.613]  They don't like having a big middle class to deal with.
[00:05:36.653 --> 00:05:37.913]  They don't care what color you are.
[00:05:38.214 --> 00:05:40.294]  They want you poor and under their control.
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.761]  So, I have really prepared a lot.
[00:05:43.781 --> 00:05:46.383]  I always prepare for the broadcast, but I've really prepared a lot today.
[00:05:46.403 --> 00:05:52.486]  So let me do my little best going over what we're going to be breaking down today.
[00:05:52.886 --> 00:05:59.990]  We have the new Attorney General, now confirmed, who swears to declare war on all Trump voters, all 80 million of them.
[00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:05.633]  And he has General Ida Ray that carried out the gun confiscation in Katrina, famously.
[00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:10.250]  Saying that all Trump supporters are white supremacist and terrorist.
[00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.392]  These are people are just completely insane and out of control.
[00:06:13.412 --> 00:06:19.214]  We're going to be laying all of that out for you today, Sunday live.
[00:06:19.234 --> 00:06:23.196]  New Attorney General pledges to persecute all populist Americans.
[00:06:24.496 --> 00:06:28.498]  One month of Biden and America is already collapsing.
[00:06:29.578 --> 00:06:36.481]  He carried out the gun confiscation in Katrina of people in their homes, high and dry, and he is prepared to move against the public now.
[00:06:41.121 --> 00:06:42.843]  So that is all coming up.
[00:06:42.963 --> 00:06:47.528]  Here is General Idea Ray, and we'll also be getting to the new Attorney General.
[00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:52.853]  Biden, the Democrats, still running scared after stealing election.
[00:06:52.993 --> 00:06:55.296]  Will never hold an open event with the American people.
[00:06:55.436 --> 00:06:57.058]  It is so incredibly obvious.
[00:06:58.857 --> 00:07:01.018]  Ignored by media, dirtbag Joe Biden says U.S.
[00:07:01.038 --> 00:07:04.981]  veterans and former police officers are fueling white supremacy in America.
[00:07:05.001 --> 00:07:11.585]  School children are being taught nationwide we have PSAs that whiteness is evil that must be rejected and rebuked.
[00:07:12.125 --> 00:07:14.867]  I mean, this is just beyond KKK stuff on the left.
[00:07:16.288 --> 00:07:21.732]  Meanwhile, the Justice Department and FBI are investigating whether Roger Stone and Alex Jones play a role in the Capitol siege.
[00:07:21.812 --> 00:07:23.493]  That's The Washington Post.
[00:07:24.847 --> 00:07:25.007]  U.S.
[00:07:25.027 --> 00:07:27.848]  investigating Alex Jones and Roger Stone.
[00:07:28.188 --> 00:07:33.549]  You mean the shy comrade FBI investigating Alex Jones and Roger Stone for links to Capitol rioters.
[00:07:33.629 --> 00:07:34.229]  Oh my goodness.
[00:07:35.369 --> 00:07:38.089]  Once upon a presidency, populist to dissident.
[00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:43.910]  And that ties in to meet the new President of the United States, Barack Obama, now in his third term.
[00:07:44.231 --> 00:07:48.931]  That is the first stack that I'm going to cover in detail next segment.
[00:07:49.852 --> 00:07:51.872]  That's just one of the stacks.
[00:07:53.387 --> 00:07:55.588]  Let's look at the next stack I'm going to cover in the segment after that.
[00:07:56.088 --> 00:07:57.089]  Smoking gun!
[00:07:57.169 --> 00:08:01.631]  Joe Biden's Department of Energy blocked Texas from increasing power ahead of Killer Storm.
[00:08:02.051 --> 00:08:07.314]  We have the Department of Energy document, and of course we'll show how under Obama they shut down over 100 power plants.
[00:08:07.734 --> 00:08:12.216]  Trump had to turn them back on, but the owners said, we don't trust the fact that you'll be still in office.
[00:08:12.236 --> 00:08:13.056]  They're going to remove you.
[00:08:13.457 --> 00:08:15.197]  So they never reopened any of the coal power plants.
[00:08:15.638 --> 00:08:17.198]  Natural gas doesn't work in the cold.
[00:08:17.699 --> 00:08:20.980]  We had natural gas generator because it's all you can basically buy these days.
[00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:22.501]  It failed here as well.
[00:08:23.717 --> 00:08:27.901]  So when Bill Gates goes, oh, it's natural gas that failed, yeah, because you took the coal power plants out.
[00:08:30.304 --> 00:08:31.826]  That is all coming up.
[00:08:32.006 --> 00:08:38.653]  And the 18,000% power increases for many people, folks with $500 bills got $17,000 bills.
[00:08:38.673 --> 00:08:45.140]  Now remember, I told you, once the rolling back blackouts begin, they'll always use cold weather or really hot weather as the excuse.
[00:08:46.459 --> 00:08:53.584]  They'll then down their regular systems and then make you buy it from other grids that they own and control and make billions an hour sometimes.
[00:08:53.904 --> 00:08:57.406]  And that's what happened to major fleecing of Texas.
[00:08:57.986 --> 00:09:09.034]  I will give you the complete breakdown of that in a huge special report on Friday with the exclusive document protested at the governor's mansion yesterday because he's got
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:17.624]  Joe Biden coming sometime next week to grandstand and give us our own tax money back and tell us how it's Texas' fault that the power went out when it wasn't.
[00:09:17.644 --> 00:09:21.447]  And I've been warning, this was coming ad nauseum.
[00:09:22.007 --> 00:09:25.169]  Then, after we cover that incredibly important area.
[00:09:26.206 --> 00:09:26.706]  We have.
[00:09:27.047 --> 00:09:27.867]  It's madness.
[00:09:27.907 --> 00:09:30.789]  And I've actually read the new, or scanned over the new legislation.
[00:09:31.149 --> 00:09:33.410]  Former Trump advisor Stephen Miller goes off.
[00:09:33.811 --> 00:09:40.835]  Democrats propose sending invites to criminal legal aliens, rapists, murderers, you name it, to come back and get citizenship.
[00:09:41.315 --> 00:09:46.178]  But outside of that, by fiat, they've already opened the borders up completely.
[00:09:46.618 --> 00:09:50.681]  Doesn't matter how unpopular it is because Joe Biden stole the election.
[00:09:51.823 --> 00:09:53.405]  That is all coming up.
[00:09:53.425 --> 00:09:58.650]  AT&T trying to merge with the whole Huawei and the Communist Chinese.
[00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:01.973]  That's another incredibly important stack.
[00:10:02.805 --> 00:10:04.306]  Also, all from L.A.
[00:10:04.326 --> 00:10:05.447]  to Baltimore, Maryland.
[00:10:05.887 --> 00:10:08.268]  From California to Maryland.
[00:10:08.488 --> 00:10:09.189]  All over the country.
[00:10:09.249 --> 00:10:11.590]  New York to Dallas, Texas is proposing it.
[00:10:12.171 --> 00:10:14.612]  They say, pay criminals not to rob and kill.
[00:10:14.892 --> 00:10:15.913]  It's a new novel idea.
[00:10:16.013 --> 00:10:17.314]  Pay people not to murder.
[00:10:17.734 --> 00:10:21.897]  Baltimore urges city, Baltimore activists, to pay criminals not to murder.
[00:10:22.157 --> 00:10:23.598]  You know, that's called paying a pirate.
[00:10:24.378 --> 00:10:25.598]  Paying someone for a ransom?
[00:10:26.258 --> 00:10:35.901]  It's been done before, and as Rudiger Kipling said, once you pay the pirate once, you'll pay him twice, you'll pay him three times, until he finally kidnaps you and sells you for a ransom as well.
[00:10:36.201 --> 00:10:38.021]  That's how third world countries collapse.
[00:10:38.482 --> 00:10:41.802]  And we're following an exact trail of collapse.
[00:10:41.862 --> 00:10:44.023]  And the country's being sucked dry.
[00:10:44.043 --> 00:10:46.543]  Well, we all first just signal and wear our mask.
[00:10:47.124 --> 00:10:48.984]  And now Biden says it's permanent.
[00:10:49.024 --> 00:10:49.804]  Never take them off.
[00:10:49.884 --> 00:10:52.105]  Doesn't matter if you take the vaccine, that doesn't protect you.
[00:10:52.945 --> 00:10:59.009]  Oh, but there's herd immunity, suddenly the death toll is way down because the winter is going to end and there won't be people dying of flu and all the rest of it.
[00:10:59.469 --> 00:11:03.391]  It's a giant fraud, but we still comply so the tyranny gets worse.
[00:11:04.412 --> 00:11:06.633]  And then the big whopper.
[00:11:07.613 --> 00:11:09.875]  I'm going to cover this last segment of the first hour.
[00:11:10.435 --> 00:11:18.319]  When I read the headline, I thought, okay, I trust Christian Anahan at Information Liberation does a great job.
[00:11:18.339 --> 00:11:19.720]  And I said, let me go read the New York Times article.
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:20.761]  It was true.
[00:11:22.298 --> 00:11:27.920]  Within two paragraphs it says, critical thinking is the enemy and must be suspended in your mind.
[00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:33.142]  Directly called Crime Stop or Double Think from 1984.
[00:11:33.862 --> 00:11:38.124]  And a guy that stalked me here in Austin for a long time, Charlie Wurzel, the weasel,
[00:11:39.915 --> 00:11:50.343]  is in the article talking to professors about how we must only believe them and only follow them and disregard everything else and report anyone that doesn't agree with the New York Times.
[00:11:50.443 --> 00:11:57.948]  I mean, that's what cults do when they get wobbly is, don't talk to your family, don't read anything else, don't have any friends, only the cult.
[00:11:58.911 --> 00:12:00.853]  New York Times, Critical Thinking.
[00:12:00.973 --> 00:12:03.555]  Is it helping in the fight against misinformation?
[00:12:03.655 --> 00:12:04.075]  No.
[00:12:04.936 --> 00:12:05.857]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:12:06.157 --> 00:12:10.241]  It's like Snopes came out and Bill Gates came out last week and said, Alex Jones is a liar.
[00:12:10.921 --> 00:12:11.862]  They named me, actually.
[00:12:12.402 --> 00:12:14.824]  And said, India did not ban the Pfizer shot.
[00:12:14.904 --> 00:12:15.385]  He's a liar.
[00:12:16.306 --> 00:12:19.288]  Anyone can type it, go to the Indian websites, all in English.
[00:12:19.308 --> 00:12:23.011]  It's a billion, 300 million people, super scientific in their science sectors.
[00:12:24.112 --> 00:12:26.895]  And they banned it.
[00:12:27.793 --> 00:12:28.253]  They banned it.
[00:12:28.814 --> 00:12:30.796]  They said, no, you haven't done the studies.
[00:12:30.956 --> 00:12:33.899]  We got evidence of people being brain damaged and being paralyzed.
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:44.189]  And then they had all these publications come out, Newsweek, you name it, and say, I was a liar that India approved the vaccine.
[00:12:44.209 --> 00:12:45.751]  Well, I'm going to show you.
[00:12:45.771 --> 00:12:47.333]  Anybody can type in India.
[00:12:48.678 --> 00:12:51.620]  Stops emergency approval of Pfizer mRNA vaccine.
[00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:52.680]  You'll get hundreds of articles.
[00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:53.741]  They don't care though.
[00:12:53.761 --> 00:12:54.761]  They go, oh, don't believe them.
[00:12:55.482 --> 00:12:55.782]  No.
[00:12:56.122 --> 00:12:57.683]  And Hank Aaron, remember Hank Aaron?
[00:12:59.043 --> 00:13:00.804]  The famous baseball player, probably the best ever.
[00:13:01.185 --> 00:13:07.308]  They said he died of natural causes, not the second round of COVID.
[00:13:07.568 --> 00:13:08.448]  And they had an autopsy.
[00:13:09.489 --> 00:13:10.389]  Robert Kennedy Jr.
[00:13:10.409 --> 00:13:11.130]  went and talked to him.
[00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:13.351]  They gave him statements and said, we never saw his body.
[00:13:14.051 --> 00:13:15.292]  He died after the second shot.
[00:13:16.701 --> 00:13:19.542]  They told us natural causes, so we bought it because we're told to do.
[00:13:20.543 --> 00:13:22.243]  Oh, and Pfizer withdraws application.
[00:13:22.263 --> 00:13:23.084]  Put that back up, please.
[00:13:24.504 --> 00:13:26.505]  For use of its COVID-19 vaccine in India.
[00:13:26.705 --> 00:13:27.785]  CNBC!
[00:13:28.146 --> 00:13:29.366]  In fact, print that for me.
[00:13:30.607 --> 00:13:35.549]  But I'm gonna show you all these publications.
[00:13:35.609 --> 00:13:38.710]  I mean, it was in AP, it was in Reuters, it was in Newsweek.
[00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:40.551]  Jones made it up again.
[00:13:40.571 --> 00:13:40.631]  Wow.
[00:13:44.517 --> 00:13:50.239]  And imagine me and Charlie Wurzel get 30 pieces of silver to sit there and lie to people and then write articles about.
[00:13:50.479 --> 00:13:51.759]  Don't read anything from the New York Times!
[00:13:52.359 --> 00:13:54.720]  You think it's like satire, like this is a satire article.
[00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:56.141]  There's nothing satirical about it.
[00:13:56.401 --> 00:14:01.682]  These people are cult members and cult leaders and they think we're under their control.
[00:14:01.702 --> 00:14:02.003]  We're not.
[00:14:02.423 --> 00:14:04.863]  Meanwhile, talk about cults, Cartoon Network, PSA.
[00:14:05.084 --> 00:14:06.144]  We'll show you the video that's coming up.
[00:14:06.744 --> 00:14:10.129]  Tells children to seek color to become anti-racist.
[00:14:10.169 --> 00:14:10.669]  That's a quote.
[00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:13.333]  Preaches colorblindness is bad.
[00:14:13.433 --> 00:14:18.139]  So what Martin Luther King said... Oh, don't choose a football player because he plays good.
[00:14:18.339 --> 00:14:19.801]  Don't go to a restaurant because it tastes good.
[00:14:19.981 --> 00:14:21.764]  Don't buy a suit because they do a good job.
[00:14:21.824 --> 00:14:22.345]  That's what I do.
[00:14:23.836 --> 00:14:25.878]  No, no, no, it's the color of their skin.
[00:14:25.898 --> 00:14:27.660]  I mean, this is just evil, folks.
[00:14:28.341 --> 00:14:35.587]  But again, I was downtown protesting this weekend, and I would say to the leftists in the leftist downtown area, I'd say, India banned Pfizer.
[00:14:35.907 --> 00:14:37.029]  Watch out.
[00:14:37.529 --> 00:14:38.990]  Biden just endorsed death camps.
[00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:39.951]  They go, good!
[00:14:40.332 --> 00:14:41.333]  I love death camps!
[00:14:41.533 --> 00:14:42.113]  F you!
[00:14:42.494 --> 00:14:44.576]  I mean, these people are fascist scum.
[00:14:45.136 --> 00:14:45.817]  We'll be right back.
[00:14:45.837 --> 00:14:46.978]  Ladies and gentlemen, stay with us.
[00:14:51.255 --> 00:14:52.776]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:14:52.816 --> 00:14:54.396]  It's Sunday, February 21st.
[00:14:54.977 --> 00:14:55.397]  The year is 2021.
[00:14:55.457 --> 00:15:02.360]  The websites are infowars.com, newswars.com, and band.video.
[00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:12.265]  And the globalists hope around the clock that you don't research what they're really up to, that you just sit there like a victim and take it.
[00:15:12.985 --> 00:15:17.347]  Next segment, I'm going to look at the power shutdowns in Texas and the smoking gun.
[00:15:17.367 --> 00:15:19.068]  I'm going to show you the Department of Energy document.
[00:15:20.177 --> 00:15:28.883]  The state of Texas four or five days before was begging them to let them turn up the power, but there's fines and criminal penalties if they do without authorization.
[00:15:29.263 --> 00:15:33.886]  And they waited until it crashed on Valentine's Day to then let them do it.
[00:15:34.406 --> 00:15:36.347]  Oh, let me wait till you're going under the freezing water.
[00:15:36.648 --> 00:15:42.291]  Let me wait till you're dying to then give you a life vest so I can say in front of everybody that I tried to help you.
[00:15:42.371 --> 00:15:43.232]  Very, very sick.
[00:15:43.792 --> 00:15:44.593]  We've got Joe Biden.
[00:15:45.615 --> 00:15:46.176]  Coming to town.
[00:15:46.196 --> 00:15:54.976]  In fact, here's Joe Biden babbling about how he's coming to Austin like Santa Claus to give us all this free money and to give us a hand.
[00:15:55.016 --> 00:15:55.356]  Here it is.
[00:15:59.184 --> 00:16:02.366]  And so we're going to sign that declaration once it's in front of me.
[00:16:02.946 --> 00:16:06.027]  And God willing, it will bring a lot of relief to a lot of Texans.
[00:16:06.347 --> 00:16:08.408]  He said he may visit Texas next week.
[00:16:08.748 --> 00:16:16.712]  If in fact, it's concluded that I can do it without creating a burden for the folks on the ground while they're dealing with this crisis, I plan on going.
[00:16:18.233 --> 00:16:19.273]  What a nice person.
[00:16:19.814 --> 00:16:21.554]  You know, I had an old Labrador trailer that would be about 14.
[00:16:23.035 --> 00:16:30.337]  And he's got that same look right before the dog died, like kind of scared and hesitant and trying to talk but can barely do it.
[00:16:30.697 --> 00:16:33.838]  I mean, his dementia is just accelerating so horribly.
[00:16:33.898 --> 00:16:40.799]  And that's why they put him in there as a weak signal to the world to end the dollar, to move all our jobs to China and try to accelerate our collapse.
[00:16:41.019 --> 00:16:41.699]  It's all on record.
[00:16:41.719 --> 00:16:46.321]  The Council on Foreign Relations brags that Biden is a complete joke and that it's the end of the country.
[00:16:47.401 --> 00:16:50.502]  And I was in downtown Austin trying to warn him this weekend with a bullhorn.
[00:16:50.862 --> 00:16:52.202]  I was down at the governor's mansion and
[00:16:53.601 --> 00:16:56.903]  About 40% of people said, I want to kill you.
[00:16:56.923 --> 00:17:00.205]  Another 20% kind of looked at me, but they were flipping me off.
[00:17:00.625 --> 00:17:02.906]  And maybe 30% were listening and waving.
[00:17:02.946 --> 00:17:05.188]  But I mean, it's just sick.
[00:17:05.228 --> 00:17:09.930]  If I was in a hardworking area like Pittsburgh, everybody would be saying, yay, Alex.
[00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:12.111]  Where I was in San Antonio, they'd be saying, yay, Alex.
[00:17:12.171 --> 00:17:17.054]  But the liberal trendies are just absolutely out of their minds.
[00:17:17.454 --> 00:17:18.215]  There's no helping them.
[00:17:18.235 --> 00:17:19.576]  But they're going to find out real soon.
[00:17:20.782 --> 00:17:21.763]  So let's talk about this.
[00:17:21.903 --> 00:17:26.407]  Biden AG pick Merrick Garland vows to prosecute Capitol rioters.
[00:17:26.587 --> 00:17:27.528]  Zero Hedge article.
[00:17:28.609 --> 00:17:29.550]  He said it was confirmed.
[00:17:30.291 --> 00:17:34.635]  I will supervise the prosecution of white supremacists and others who stormed the Capitol January 6th.
[00:17:35.075 --> 00:17:39.039]  A heinous attack that sought to disrupt a cornerstone of our democracy.
[00:17:39.359 --> 00:17:41.642]  The peaceful transfer of power to a newly elected government.
[00:17:43.043 --> 00:17:43.643]  And that's the thing.
[00:17:43.784 --> 00:17:44.885]  Everybody that protested him
[00:17:46.121 --> 00:17:47.221]  They claimed to attack the Capitol.
[00:17:47.241 --> 00:17:48.522]  It was like 200 out of a million.
[00:17:48.962 --> 00:17:51.302]  And then it turns out most of them are Antifa and other provocateurs.
[00:17:51.622 --> 00:17:53.243]  And that's the big news I should be announcing.
[00:17:53.843 --> 00:17:55.844]  I've been up here basically all day working on this.
[00:17:56.604 --> 00:17:59.405]  And right now they're putting all the documents, all the videos, all the clips in.
[00:18:00.585 --> 00:18:08.867]  At the bottom of the hour, next hour, I'm going to premiere a report that will take two segments to play that is incredible.
[00:18:09.947 --> 00:18:14.909]  And proves it has Democrats, Antifa, people that have been arrested, people caught working for CNN.
[00:18:17.043 --> 00:18:23.709]  Saying that they staged the Capitol attack and all the witnesses in the video, it's all come together, it's all come out in the last week.
[00:18:24.109 --> 00:18:24.690]  It's insane.
[00:18:26.451 --> 00:18:37.681]  And that's why they've got this horrible, evil general who came out, General Idarae, who ran the gun confiscation in Katrina.
[00:18:38.541 --> 00:18:42.405]  Remember how they went into the houses and went into high and dry areas and went into people?
[00:18:43.832 --> 00:18:55.964]  All over the state and would come in and break into their safes and take their guns because General Idarae said we're confiscating your guns and this has been used as a training drill across the country now for future gun confiscation.
[00:18:58.226 --> 00:18:59.067]  General Honoré.
[00:18:59.667 --> 00:19:01.869]  I'm not going off a teleprompter.
[00:19:02.069 --> 00:19:02.870]  General Honoré.
[00:19:03.511 --> 00:19:08.736]  So General Honoré who evacuated the Superdome 15 years ago talks about
[00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:10.690]  Katrina.
[00:19:11.451 --> 00:19:13.272]  And he tells us what a big savior he is.
[00:19:13.993 --> 00:19:18.716]  But in reality, this is their giant power grab, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:19.897 --> 00:19:24.240]  And that takes us to this next article from MSN.
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:32.066]  And whether it's the New York Times, the Washington Post, the LA Times, the Detroit Free Press, the Austin American States, or the Houston Chronicle, every paper in the country ran this today.
[00:19:32.786 --> 00:19:36.409]  Feds probing Roger Stone and Alex Jones over roles in the Capitol.
[00:19:37.329 --> 00:19:43.113]  And the articles go on from there about how they want to arrest us, they want to get us.
[00:19:43.634 --> 00:19:51.440]  The Justice Department and FBI are investigating whether Roger Stone, Alex Jones played a role in the Capitol Siege report sets.
[00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:52.961]  Oh my gosh.
[00:19:54.442 --> 00:19:56.704]  People call me, family calls me, they say, are you concerned?
[00:19:56.744 --> 00:19:57.544]  No, I'm not concerned.
[00:19:58.425 --> 00:19:59.286]  I'm worried about the country.
[00:19:59.306 --> 00:20:01.167]  I know who did it.
[00:20:02.348 --> 00:20:03.249]  I know who ran the attack.
[00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:16.767]  I know the Democrat organizations who have the history of it and who we caught involved and who bragged and organized it, who ran the Q movement, and who manipulated 200 people out of a million to do that, and who ordered the police to stand out.
[00:20:17.047 --> 00:20:18.488]  Why do you think Lindsey Graham said,
[00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:22.471]  The day they ended the witch hunt of Trump a week and a half ago.
[00:20:22.991 --> 00:20:28.834]  Why do you think Lindsey Graham said, what did Pelosi know and when did she know it?
[00:20:29.834 --> 00:20:34.276]  He knows she was briefed two weeks before, a week before and a day before and she didn't tell even the Democrats.
[00:20:34.776 --> 00:20:40.858]  They knew the attack was coming and it turns out other Democrats bragged to Time Magazine that they knew and staged it.
[00:20:41.299 --> 00:20:42.599]  And we have undercover recordings.
[00:20:43.079 --> 00:20:44.480]  It's all next hour.
[00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:52.362]  This is the most incredible information when it comes to exposing it, right as they try to saddle the American people with all of this.
[00:20:52.402 --> 00:21:00.625]  So, I'm going to play for you when we come back, General Idre, am I pronouncing that right this time?
[00:21:01.965 --> 00:21:03.325]  Honoré, I know I'm being sarcastic.
[00:21:03.746 --> 00:21:05.126]  General Honoré.
[00:21:05.666 --> 00:21:07.907]  I'm going to play you General Honoré.
[00:21:09.622 --> 00:21:16.066]  Talking about confiscating your guns and taking your guns and saying no one will be alarmed, no one will be armed.
[00:21:16.906 --> 00:21:18.247]  Suddenly Joe Biden can't talk.
[00:21:18.647 --> 00:21:20.829]  No one will be allowed to be armed.
[00:21:21.249 --> 00:21:23.030]  All the guns will be taken.
[00:21:25.486 --> 00:21:27.067]  You know, I'm not the oldest president in U.S.
[00:21:27.087 --> 00:21:27.387]  history.
[00:21:27.447 --> 00:21:27.668]  I'm just 47.
[00:21:27.788 --> 00:21:29.749]  Maybe I'm getting seen off now, too.
[00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:32.071]  But that's the thing about being teleprompter-free.
[00:21:32.771 --> 00:21:37.695]  Sometimes your mind is completely sharp, doesn't, like a needle going down the record, hit the exact spot.
[00:21:37.715 --> 00:21:51.785]  But when we come back, I'm going to lay all of that out for you and play the clips from back when Katrina took place, of the incredible excuse to go into high and dry areas and take old ladies' guns, widows' guns, old men's guns, veterans' guns,
[00:21:52.265 --> 00:21:58.169]  And then a lot of the feds started just robbing it with the local police, Walmart, and other stores.
[00:21:58.189 --> 00:21:58.749]  Remember all that?
[00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:05.073]  So if you want to see the criminality of who works for the government, you're going to see it coming up next segment.
[00:22:05.113 --> 00:22:12.778]  It's not everybody, but the government's so compartmentalized, good guys can't stop bad guys, so good guys work right next to giant compartments of bad guys.
[00:22:13.258 --> 00:22:19.262]  That's why it's so important, ladies and gentlemen, during these incredibly dangerous times, to keep InfoWars on the air.
[00:22:20.626 --> 00:22:22.988]  Without you, we're not going to be able to stay on air.
[00:22:23.308 --> 00:22:24.509]  Without you, we're not going to be here.
[00:22:25.069 --> 00:22:27.611]  And I'm just going to keep going to the end no matter what happens.
[00:22:27.951 --> 00:22:28.632]  They want to get us.
[00:22:28.672 --> 00:22:29.713]  They want to put us in prison.
[00:22:30.273 --> 00:22:31.354]  They want to persecute us.
[00:22:31.434 --> 00:22:31.914]  That's okay.
[00:22:31.994 --> 00:22:32.515]  I expect...
[00:22:33.717 --> 00:22:35.478]  To be attacked when I'm over the target.
[00:22:35.898 --> 00:22:38.579]  When you're over the target, all the guns are aimed at you.
[00:22:38.599 --> 00:22:40.559]  So I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:22:40.579 --> 00:22:46.841]  I want to let you know that the high-quality, storable food we have is ready to be shipped to you within a day of your order.
[00:22:46.901 --> 00:22:49.822]  It's shipped out from four locations across the United States.
[00:22:50.322 --> 00:22:51.423]  It's 10% off.
[00:22:51.503 --> 00:22:52.743]  It's high-quality, storable food.
[00:22:53.003 --> 00:22:55.324]  The highest quality you're going to find for the price.
[00:22:56.325 --> 00:23:03.010]  You can pay three, four, five times and find some that taste a little bit better, but it is not inexpensive and high quality like this.
[00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:06.032]  This is the best food for the price you're going to find.
[00:23:06.292 --> 00:23:11.396]  PrepareWithAlex.com takes you right to the sub page of InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:23:12.757 --> 00:23:15.941]  That's infowarsstore.com or preparewithalex.com.
[00:23:16.141 --> 00:23:25.872]  For a limited time, a big discount because of the emergency, all the craziness, an additional 10% off rate of ship out to you in waterproof packaging and so much more anywhere in the world, really.
[00:23:26.153 --> 00:23:28.435]  So, infowarsstore.com or preparewithalex.com.
[00:23:28.455 --> 00:23:30.838]  There's a bunch of other big specials as well on the site.
[00:23:30.858 --> 00:23:31.779]  Let's take advantage of those.
[00:23:31.819 --> 00:23:32.260]  We'll be right back.
[00:23:52.975 --> 00:24:06.275]  So we've got the Lieutenant General Russell Honore who helped lead the unconstitutional criminal gun confiscation in Katrina back during George W. Bush and all his nightmare activity.
[00:24:07.813 --> 00:24:10.195]  Coming out last week, Tucker Carlson covered it.
[00:24:10.235 --> 00:24:11.516]  We covered it two weeks ago.
[00:24:12.197 --> 00:24:18.202]  Just in video conferences and in public statements and in tweets saying, we need to just arrest Trump supporters.
[00:24:18.242 --> 00:24:18.983]  We need to kill them.
[00:24:19.523 --> 00:24:20.865]  We need to put them in FEMA camps.
[00:24:20.885 --> 00:24:22.106]  We need to put them on no-fly list.
[00:24:22.366 --> 00:24:23.587]  We need to take their guns.
[00:24:24.748 --> 00:24:26.069]  I mean, this guy is a punk.
[00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:28.551]  This guy's an un-American thug.
[00:24:29.132 --> 00:24:33.355]  But he's par for the course for the generals that they've got up there.
[00:24:33.556 --> 00:24:34.637]  And so he's been
[00:24:36.581 --> 00:24:42.143]  He's prepared and is in charge now of this New Pretorian Guard of purging the U.S.
[00:24:42.203 --> 00:24:44.063]  military of quote white supremacists.
[00:24:44.103 --> 00:24:51.525]  That means anybody that supports Trump, anybody that supports America, anybody that supports the Constitutional Republic.
[00:24:54.006 --> 00:24:58.907]  And so, Americans have to come to grips with that.
[00:24:59.707 --> 00:25:01.608]  They have to come, zoom in a little bit closer for me.
[00:25:01.628 --> 00:25:05.449]  I want to do it with the documentary cameras being on the article, just like boom, right there is what I want.
[00:25:06.997 --> 00:25:09.518]  And so that's where we are as a republic.
[00:25:09.558 --> 00:25:10.738]  That's where we are as a country.
[00:25:11.339 --> 00:25:23.063]  And we have to ask ourselves, is this a good thing to have the Democrats in league with the Communist Chinese that are pushing open borders, cutting off our pipelines?
[00:25:24.318 --> 00:25:33.740]  That are demoralizing our nation, that are telling us that men are going to compete in women's sports, that are just doing everything you can to wreck the psyche and morale of the people.
[00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:35.040]  Is that a good thing?
[00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:35.780]  And the answer is no.
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:47.502]  If we recognize it's an assault, if we recognize it's meant to break us up, if we recognize it's meant to make us kill each other, then we can override it and not have the civil war we want to avoid.
[00:25:48.603 --> 00:25:50.263]  Instead of laying down
[00:25:52.685 --> 00:25:53.185]  The Globalist
[00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:19.868]  The police and the National Guard under General Russell Honore's directive many years ago, he's now been resurrected to do this on a national scale.
[00:26:19.908 --> 00:26:21.109]  Biden's got the bills introduced.
[00:26:21.129 --> 00:26:30.037]  He says he's going to move forward with executive orders outside of law, register all guns, confiscate all semi-autos, ban all magazines above nine rounds.
[00:26:30.197 --> 00:26:31.178]  I mean, it's all been announced.
[00:26:31.819 --> 00:26:36.003]  He says if Congress doesn't pass it within 60 days, executive order, and we're off to the races.
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:41.882]  And a weird, crazy, senile America hater is in charge of it all.
[00:26:43.163 --> 00:26:45.824]  Then the next clip is the clergy response teams.
[00:26:45.844 --> 00:26:59.731]  They've gotten preachers all over the country on the federal payroll with little FBI badges brainwashed that when the crisis goes down, tell you to take the microchip, tell you to take the vaccine, tell you to turn your guns in, tell you to go to the FEMA camp.
[00:27:01.209 --> 00:27:03.271]  And so that's what this is, is the takedown of the country.
[00:27:03.291 --> 00:27:07.154]  It's why they're on the news saying, re-educate us, brainwash us.
[00:27:07.274 --> 00:27:17.423]  It's why they're on the news over and over and over and over again, teaching us that we're bad.
[00:27:18.124 --> 00:27:18.905]  This is a takeover.
[00:27:19.465 --> 00:27:21.167]  That's why they've cut the communications off.
[00:27:22.888 --> 00:27:24.329]  They're preparing to devalue the dollar.
[00:27:24.349 --> 00:27:25.310]  They're already doing it.
[00:27:25.631 --> 00:27:28.173]  I mean, we're in rough shape, and I'm just not going to lie to you about it.
[00:27:29.383 --> 00:27:37.467]  Trump fought hard, but the Q movement neutralized him and said, he's invincible, everything's fine, don't get involved, to make sure while the left was active, you weren't.
[00:27:37.487 --> 00:27:48.392]  I know most of this audience saw through it, but I keep hammering back to Q, because you'll see next hour, when we expose the main propaganda group they used, with Antifa, to take over a few right-wingers to attack the Capitol.
[00:27:48.412 --> 00:27:55.976]  You understand how critical they are, because they're planning to try to provoke a tour of more stuff on March 4th, where they claim Trump's about to take over and be the president again.
[00:27:56.256 --> 00:27:57.737]  When I assure you, that's not the case.
[00:28:00.282 --> 00:28:05.864]  So we've got to kill the CIA globalist system that Q is.
[00:28:05.944 --> 00:28:08.465]  We've got to kill its credibility, not physically kill it.
[00:28:09.025 --> 00:28:11.526]  We've got to get people to understand what it really is.
[00:28:11.986 --> 00:28:13.207]  It's a sophisticated syop.
[00:28:13.387 --> 00:28:14.908]  Because I know you want a bunch of good news.
[00:28:15.008 --> 00:28:15.708]  I understand that.
[00:28:16.908 --> 00:28:19.269]  But I'm not going to sit there and give you fake news, folks, okay?
[00:28:19.289 --> 00:28:21.810]  I'm going to give you the reality, as best I know it.
[00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:23.731]  So here's the two clubs back-to-back.
[00:28:29.833 --> 00:28:32.334]  ABC New World News, September 8, 2005.
[00:28:32.414 --> 00:28:37.677]  That includes New Orleans, where today authorities stepped up their efforts to empty the city.
[00:28:38.197 --> 00:28:41.959]  Bob Woodruff is there again tonight with an extraordinary human drama unfolding.
[00:28:42.019 --> 00:28:42.279]  Bob?
[00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:45.861]  That's true, Elizabeth, and good evening from New Orleans.
[00:28:45.881 --> 00:28:55.846]  Here the police and the National Guard find themselves in a very difficult position tonight to try to carry out an order to force people from the city without actually using force.
[00:29:00.512 --> 00:29:03.395]  Today in New Orleans, they got a lot tougher on the holdouts.
[00:29:05.557 --> 00:29:09.601]  Not only the flooded areas, but New Orleans' driest and wealthiest neighborhoods too.
[00:29:13.244 --> 00:29:18.409]  The police and National Guard going street by street, house to house.
[00:29:19.884 --> 00:29:21.044]  Back it up 10 seconds, please.
[00:29:51.548 --> 00:29:54.232]  Later it came out on Fox News, and our own reporters covered it.
[00:29:54.272 --> 00:29:59.098]  They went into high and dry areas surrounding cities, took guns, robbed people's houses.
[00:29:59.118 --> 00:30:00.560]  The military did, and the police did later.
[00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:03.043]  The Louisiana police did.
[00:30:03.063 --> 00:30:06.407]  They're not all crooks, but again, they don't control the ones that are crooks, so they have to let them do it.
[00:30:06.628 --> 00:30:07.168]  Very corrupt.
[00:30:07.268 --> 00:30:07.849]  That's how it works.
[00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:10.391]  And so again, they did take everybody's guns.
[00:30:10.711 --> 00:30:12.292]  And they didn't not use force.
[00:30:12.332 --> 00:30:13.072]  That's all a damn lie.
[00:30:13.112 --> 00:30:15.693]  You have the famous footage of the old lady, they're taking the revolver from her.
[00:30:16.193 --> 00:30:21.636]  So imagine, they took them out of their houses that were high and dry, made them go to the super domes, they could be gang raped.
[00:30:21.856 --> 00:30:22.436]  Let's continue.
[00:30:24.617 --> 00:30:25.718]  ...arm anyone inside.
[00:30:25.738 --> 00:30:28.599]  You said guns will be taken?
[00:30:28.639 --> 00:30:29.740]  No one will be able to be armed.
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:30.980]  We will take all weapons.
[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:36.663]  That happened today in this wealthy neighborhood where homeowners had armed themselves to protect their mansions.
[00:30:38.583 --> 00:30:40.427]  Residents were handcuffed on the ground.
[00:30:40.908 --> 00:30:44.056]  In the end, police took their weapons but let them stay in their homes.
[00:30:44.557 --> 00:30:47.364]  They were a little bit threatened because our weapons were bigger than their weapons.
[00:30:49.113 --> 00:30:53.855]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[00:30:55.475 --> 00:30:58.536]  This guard unit occupied a church, using it as a base camp.
[00:30:58.917 --> 00:31:02.478]  They had to leave a note because they could not get hold of the pastor to get permission.
[00:31:02.718 --> 00:31:03.898]  It is, it is surreal.
[00:31:04.819 --> 00:31:08.040]  You just never, you never expect to do this in your own country.
[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:13.323]  Chris Montgomery says he'd rather be in Iraq than patrolling American neighborhoods.
[00:31:39.544 --> 00:31:39.786]  Us.
[00:31:43.183 --> 00:31:50.428]  Tarleton Heston's famous declaration captures a truly American value, the overarching desire to protect our freedoms.
[00:31:51.109 --> 00:31:57.353]  But gun confiscation is exactly what happened during the state of emergency following Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.
[00:31:58.074 --> 00:31:58.354]  U.S.
[00:31:58.394 --> 00:32:06.640]  troops also arrived, something far easier to do even now thanks to last year's elimination of the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act.
[00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:08.221]  That forbid U.S.
[00:32:08.281 --> 00:32:10.322]  troops from policing on American soil.
[00:32:12.521 --> 00:32:19.684]  If martial law were enacted here at home, like depicted in the movie The Siege, easing public fears and quelling dissent would be critical.
[00:32:20.164 --> 00:32:25.306]  And that's exactly what the Clergy Response Team, as it's called, helped accomplish in New Orleans.
[00:32:25.806 --> 00:32:32.369]  Jeff, the primary thing that we say to anybody is let's cooperate and get this thing over with, and then we'll settle the differences once the crisis is over.
[00:32:32.649 --> 00:32:38.511]  Such Clergy Response Teams would walk a tightrope between the needs of the government versus the wishes of the public.
[00:32:39.011 --> 00:32:45.857]  In a lot of cases, these clergy would already be known in the neighborhoods in which they're helping to defuse that situation.
[00:32:46.157 --> 00:32:53.583]  For the clergy, one of the biggest tools that they will have in helping calm the public down or obey the law is the Bible itself.
[00:32:54.003 --> 00:32:55.445]  Specifically, Romans.
[00:32:55.945 --> 00:32:56.305]  Romans 13.
[00:32:56.866 --> 00:32:57.346]  That's enough.
[00:32:57.426 --> 00:32:59.068]  That's Romans 13.
[00:32:59.148 --> 00:33:00.309]  Render unto Caesar what's Caesar.
[00:33:00.329 --> 00:33:03.491]  They were trying to trick Christ so they could kill him.
[00:33:04.212 --> 00:33:04.612]  Saying what?
[00:33:04.632 --> 00:33:05.573]  You're not going to pay taxes?
[00:33:05.613 --> 00:33:06.314]  Caesar's on this.
[00:33:07.403 --> 00:33:10.166]  He was rendering to Caesar that which is Caesar, and later Paul quoted it.
[00:33:10.487 --> 00:33:11.388]  Hitler's favorite quote.
[00:33:11.648 --> 00:33:13.290]  Christ said, sell your cloak and buy a sword.
[00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:14.492]  These people want you disarmed.
[00:33:14.792 --> 00:33:16.314]  They've hired most of the criminal preachers.
[00:33:16.414 --> 00:33:19.918]  Most churches are dens of Satanism run by pot-bellied pedophiles.
[00:33:19.938 --> 00:33:20.719]  We'll be right back.
[00:33:20.739 --> 00:33:21.100]  Stay with us.
[00:33:29.153 --> 00:33:33.476]  Welcome back to the most censored, most lied about, most demonized broadcast in the world.
[00:33:34.057 --> 00:33:35.058]  We're teleprompter free.
[00:33:35.098 --> 00:33:36.499]  The globalists aren't telling me what to say.
[00:33:37.039 --> 00:33:38.140]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:42.223]  Very, very honored to be joining you on this live Sunday, February 21st, 2020 transmission.
[00:33:44.963 --> 00:33:48.226]  Okay, I want to hit what really happened with the power outages.
[00:33:48.506 --> 00:33:49.067]  And you know what?
[00:33:49.367 --> 00:33:49.687]  Darn it.
[00:33:50.508 --> 00:33:55.032]  I was just back in my office and then talked to my wife that called me and I forgot to get it.
[00:33:55.752 --> 00:33:57.113]  So will somebody do me a huge favor?
[00:33:57.133 --> 00:33:59.155]  Will somebody run into my office right in front of the computer?
[00:33:59.636 --> 00:34:02.838]  Is a stack of articles about that thick and just bring me that.
[00:34:03.519 --> 00:34:04.920]  But you guys are quick enough and good enough.
[00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:10.825]  You guys can actually pull up the document that I want to show from the Department of Energy.
[00:34:11.929 --> 00:34:15.572]  Telling the state of Texas that they weren't going to turn the power on until they had a crisis.
[00:34:16.212 --> 00:34:24.399]  And the fact that the feds, there it is, so no need to go to my office now, were actually in control of Texas energy.
[00:34:24.579 --> 00:34:25.500]  Simply incredible.
[00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:27.081]  Let's still grab it off my desk, thanks.
[00:34:28.142 --> 00:34:29.603]  So that's coming up in just a moment.
[00:34:29.944 --> 00:34:30.684]  Smoking gun.
[00:34:30.724 --> 00:34:36.709]  Joe Biden, Department of Energy, blocked Texas from increasing power ahead of storm.
[00:34:37.850 --> 00:34:40.172]  Now, before we hit that,
[00:34:42.352 --> 00:34:43.272]  And show you the document.
[00:34:45.113 --> 00:34:50.775]  It's so incredible to have this story we're going to cover at the start of the next hour.
[00:34:51.495 --> 00:34:52.255]  New York Times.
[00:34:52.355 --> 00:34:55.796]  Critical thinking isn't helping the fight against misinformation.
[00:34:56.536 --> 00:34:59.617]  That's an InfoWars.com posted story for information liberation.
[00:35:00.037 --> 00:35:02.178]  You're thinking, oh surely they didn't really say that.
[00:35:02.798 --> 00:35:03.238]  Ha ha!
[00:35:04.439 --> 00:35:07.480]  Here's the Charlie Wurzel, one of my stalkers.
[00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:09.760]  Don't go down the rabbit hole.
[00:35:10.381 --> 00:35:10.821]  He says,
[00:35:11.823 --> 00:35:13.424]  The critical thinking is bad.
[00:35:13.444 --> 00:35:17.205]  It actually says, do not investigate.
[00:35:17.965 --> 00:35:21.186]  I always tell you, don't believe me, investigate.
[00:35:22.146 --> 00:35:26.007]  Don't believe me that India banned the Pfizer vaccine two weeks ago.
[00:35:26.448 --> 00:35:26.908]  Look it up.
[00:35:27.408 --> 00:35:27.648]  Help.
[00:35:28.668 --> 00:35:29.309]  Here it is right here.
[00:35:29.349 --> 00:35:30.249]  I'm going to show you next hour.
[00:35:30.829 --> 00:35:33.670]  Huge articles all over the world saying I'm a liar.
[00:35:35.947 --> 00:35:39.069]  Because see, they like discredit my name and then use me to discredit other things.
[00:35:39.109 --> 00:35:41.851]  Like, Jones claims India banned the Pfizer vaccine.
[00:35:42.151 --> 00:35:42.772]  It's not true.
[00:35:43.933 --> 00:35:48.656]  The story trended on Twitter as the number 5 trend and he needs to be arrested.
[00:35:49.096 --> 00:35:50.117]  He's going to kill people.
[00:35:50.978 --> 00:35:51.318]  Look at this.
[00:35:51.678 --> 00:35:52.258]  CNBC.
[00:35:53.459 --> 00:35:53.880]  February 5th.
[00:35:55.011 --> 00:35:55.952]  Told you it's been two weeks.
[00:35:57.013 --> 00:35:58.033]  I'm just dead on my memory.
[00:35:58.294 --> 00:35:58.774]  Two weeks ago.
[00:35:59.314 --> 00:36:09.322]  Pfizer withdraws application for emergency use of its COVID-19 vaccine in India after India says it caused deaths and people to be paralyzed in their own studies and said you can't do it.
[00:36:09.642 --> 00:36:13.465]  I'm going to show you the damn press release from the Indian government.
[00:36:13.865 --> 00:36:17.969]  Because remember, they were a colony of England, so they speak English over there.
[00:36:18.389 --> 00:36:19.490]  It's their main language.
[00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:20.491]  It's not Hindi.
[00:36:20.511 --> 00:36:21.051]  It's in English.
[00:36:22.594 --> 00:36:24.135]  Not a translation, it's in English.
[00:36:24.155 --> 00:36:25.896]  It's real easy to understand.
[00:36:28.197 --> 00:36:35.360]  Oh, but Charlie Wurzel, also known as the Weasel, he says, don't do it.
[00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:37.881]  So, that's coming up next hour.
[00:36:39.602 --> 00:36:51.287]  And then I'm going to show you the exclusive video and audio, thanks to the great work of investigative journalist Millie Weaver and others, of hired CNN operatives running the Capitol assault.
[00:36:52.501 --> 00:36:52.842]  On record.
[00:36:53.422 --> 00:36:54.223]  This is huge.
[00:36:54.904 --> 00:36:56.205]  The report is being prepared.
[00:36:56.286 --> 00:36:58.728]  We were shooting it up here this morning and this afternoon.
[00:36:58.748 --> 00:37:00.731]  We're adding so many clips, so much documentation.
[00:37:01.191 --> 00:37:02.733]  Everything I say, we're going to show you a clip.
[00:37:02.913 --> 00:37:04.675]  I'm like, I talk 5 seconds, 5 second clip.
[00:37:04.916 --> 00:37:06.658]  Talk 10 seconds, 10 second clip.
[00:37:06.878 --> 00:37:07.699]  Talk 30 seconds, 30 second clip.
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:10.441]  Everything I say, I show you.
[00:37:10.821 --> 00:37:12.821]  Oh, because I'm not like the New York Times.
[00:37:13.342 --> 00:37:13.882]  Oh, don't.
[00:37:14.322 --> 00:37:15.402]  Don't research things.
[00:37:15.442 --> 00:37:16.323]  Don't look deeper.
[00:37:16.683 --> 00:37:17.803]  It'll hurt your mind.
[00:37:17.863 --> 00:37:19.664]  It'll make you confused.
[00:37:19.724 --> 00:37:20.704]  It's a thought crime.
[00:37:21.004 --> 00:37:21.725]  It's terrible.
[00:37:22.005 --> 00:37:24.466]  We don't want to have to de-platform you or arrest you.
[00:37:24.886 --> 00:37:28.887]  Why, the Attorney General says if you don't like us, the government will arrest you.
[00:37:29.207 --> 00:37:31.008]  We've emptied out the prisons for you.
[00:37:34.509 --> 00:37:36.390]  So that's all coming up.
[00:37:38.666 --> 00:37:39.206]  Next hour.
[00:37:40.767 --> 00:37:55.233]  And I'm gonna read from the Indian government, saying because of people being paralyzed, palsy, death, in the initial trials, that they banned it.
[00:37:56.493 --> 00:37:57.834]  They said they've not approved it.
[00:37:58.434 --> 00:37:58.674]  Oh!
[00:37:59.114 --> 00:38:01.935]  Well, I guess because it never got approved, it's technically not banned.
[00:38:01.975 --> 00:38:02.816]  What's the word for that?
[00:38:03.716 --> 00:38:04.816]  It's unauthorized.
[00:38:04.936 --> 00:38:05.977]  I'm sorry, Snopes.
[00:38:07.984 --> 00:38:10.025]  Just thank God I don't make a living lying to people.
[00:38:10.045 --> 00:38:11.946]  My God, what must it be like?
[00:38:12.046 --> 00:38:12.566]  The evil.
[00:38:13.547 --> 00:38:14.247]  The soullessness.
[00:38:14.487 --> 00:38:19.710]  That's why they're so desperate to shut us off air, so they can just lie to you and gaslight you forever.
[00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:21.311]  But let's move on to this.
[00:38:22.951 --> 00:38:25.573]  Any regular listener of the show doesn't have to believe me.
[00:38:25.633 --> 00:38:26.693]  You saw what Obama did.
[00:38:26.733 --> 00:38:28.414]  In fact, guys, I meant to tell you this.
[00:38:28.454 --> 00:38:28.814]  I forgot.
[00:38:28.834 --> 00:38:29.374]  I apologize.
[00:38:29.415 --> 00:38:31.155]  The poor embattled crew, they do a great job.
[00:38:31.576 --> 00:38:34.117]  But you guys pull up, Obama says he will bankrupt coal.
[00:38:34.137 --> 00:38:36.198]  Remember when he was running for office?
[00:38:37.554 --> 00:38:38.334]  Fifteen years ago?
[00:38:38.354 --> 00:38:44.618]  He said, oh you can build a coal power plant, we'll put a tax on it so high it'll bankrupt you.
[00:38:45.319 --> 00:38:47.240]  What that really means is we'll bankrupt the people.
[00:38:49.332 --> 00:38:51.033]  And coal-powered plants will operate in the cold.
[00:38:51.253 --> 00:38:52.833]  You can turn them right on, turn them right off.
[00:38:53.133 --> 00:38:53.953]  It's totally clean.
[00:38:54.033 --> 00:38:59.015]  Only water vapor comes out with carbon dioxide, not carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide plants breathe.
[00:38:59.435 --> 00:38:59.875]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:38:59.895 --> 00:39:02.756]  President Obama keeps promise to bankrupt coal industry.
[00:39:02.896 --> 00:39:08.578]  But there's three speeches he gave where he said, we're going to bankrupt coal.
[00:39:09.707 --> 00:39:10.668]  And hell, Biden's doing it.
[00:39:10.708 --> 00:39:11.929]  He turned off the Keystone Pipeline.
[00:39:12.269 --> 00:39:13.570]  Everything else, that's just oil.
[00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:14.391]  Can't have that either.
[00:39:14.791 --> 00:39:17.513]  San Francisco's banning gas-powered stoves.
[00:39:17.553 --> 00:39:19.755]  Can't have gas either, even though it's totally clean.
[00:39:19.795 --> 00:39:20.255]  Doesn't matter.
[00:39:20.275 --> 00:39:21.056]  Can't have that either.
[00:39:22.537 --> 00:39:25.079]  Gotta buy electricity from them, wherever the hell they're getting it.
[00:39:27.401 --> 00:39:28.401]  So, smoking gun.
[00:39:28.421 --> 00:39:30.143]  Oh yeah, there's the clip.
[00:39:30.163 --> 00:39:31.364]  When you got audio, let me know and I'll play it.
[00:39:32.204 --> 00:39:32.905]  Smoking gun.
[00:39:34.468 --> 00:39:39.211]  Joe Biden's Department of Energy blocked Texas from increasing power ahead of Killer Storm.
[00:39:39.231 --> 00:40:01.863]  You can go read it for yourself where it says we need relief in the document from the fact that the federal government won't let us increase the output at our coal power plants, at our hydroelectric plants, and at our gas power plants, and that the windmills froze up, and one reactor failed.
[00:40:02.796 --> 00:40:04.538]  Nuclear reactor, because they didn't want to rise it.
[00:40:05.039 --> 00:40:09.705]  So you had all this going on, but the reason that the main thing happened... Please put the document back on screen.
[00:40:10.466 --> 00:40:13.631]  The reason that the main thing happened...
[00:40:15.109 --> 00:40:19.272]  Is because they shut down over 120 power plants under Obama.
[00:40:19.412 --> 00:40:22.634]  And then they were always saying Trump was a Russian agent, was about to be out at any moment.
[00:40:22.914 --> 00:40:25.355]  So Trump tried to get companies to turn back on in Texas.
[00:40:25.655 --> 00:40:28.197]  They used to supply most of the country, at least 15 states.
[00:40:28.517 --> 00:40:31.119]  And they said, sorry, we don't think you'll be there.
[00:40:31.159 --> 00:40:32.460]  We're not going to turn back on.
[00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:35.261]  We think they'll remove you and somebody else will turn it off.
[00:40:35.702 --> 00:40:39.224]  And so we're operating on 40-year-old nuclear reactor.
[00:40:40.250 --> 00:40:42.050]  Two reactors in Houston.
[00:40:42.391 --> 00:40:43.391]  Just like the Russians were.
[00:40:43.731 --> 00:40:48.172]  We're operating on a bunch of scam windmills that are 300 miles from the main cities they supply.
[00:40:48.372 --> 00:40:49.452]  So almost all the power's lost.
[00:40:49.772 --> 00:40:52.253]  We're operating on a bunch of natural gas stuff.
[00:40:52.493 --> 00:40:57.274]  And we bought natural gas because they're clean and healthy and they're what everybody says you should get.
[00:40:57.314 --> 00:40:58.775]  They're all the mainline stores sell.
[00:40:59.855 --> 00:41:04.936]  And we have two of the damn things and they wouldn't work and they failed when all the power was off to fully power us.
[00:41:05.176 --> 00:41:08.317]  So I went out and got a big-ass diesel generator and it worked great and got us back on air.
[00:41:09.957 --> 00:41:10.698]  But we already know that.
[00:41:10.898 --> 00:41:15.801]  Fossil fuels burn at the site clean and explosively, so they drive those pistons.
[00:41:16.021 --> 00:41:17.402]  They drive those turbines.
[00:41:17.602 --> 00:41:29.731]  They give you good, clean energy, like in your car, instead of driving around in some electric lawnmower that, by the way, took more fossil fuel to burn to send it down the power lines, even if it's from windmills.
[00:41:29.951 --> 00:41:33.473]  The average windmill takes 20 years to pay for the carbon that went in it.
[00:41:33.633 --> 00:41:34.874]  And by the way, carbon isn't bad.
[00:41:35.074 --> 00:41:35.875]  It's what plants breathe.
[00:41:37.278 --> 00:41:40.742]  But they chose it because it's everywhere and they can tax it and track it and control it.
[00:41:42.004 --> 00:41:43.946]  So, it's a big document.
[00:41:44.007 --> 00:41:44.868]  It's a big article.
[00:41:44.948 --> 00:41:46.169]  It's at InfoWars.com.
[00:41:46.189 --> 00:41:47.010]  I suggest you get it.
[00:41:47.878 --> 00:41:59.965]  I'm going to ask our great writer, Jamie White, who's up here on Sundays, to retake this article and repost it in the live show feed so people can see the link and find it easily and read the document for yourself.
[00:42:00.605 --> 00:42:06.709]  Got the governor begging them, let us please turn up these plants ahead of the storm getting here, and they said no.
[00:42:07.901 --> 00:42:11.562]  Not until your power fails and until you've been buying it from outside sources.
[00:42:11.602 --> 00:42:16.143]  By then, it was Sunday night, the power had been off in most areas, and it was too late.
[00:42:16.543 --> 00:42:23.806]  And then, oh, you're allowed to now up your carbon without fines or enforcement.
[00:42:23.926 --> 00:42:24.886]  And that's all in there.
[00:42:25.246 --> 00:42:33.988]  And then now Biden can come as the gracious lord and look at the pathetic Texas that everyone from around the country is running to to get away from him and the blue cities.
[00:42:34.369 --> 00:42:35.829]  And he can sit there and do that.
[00:42:40.836 --> 00:42:43.038]  So when we come back next hour, we're pulling it in.
[00:42:43.118 --> 00:42:47.422]  I'm going to get you the clip of Obama saying, we're going to bankrupt the coal plants.
[00:42:47.442 --> 00:42:48.783]  But you already know that.
[00:42:49.784 --> 00:42:51.585]  And so that's what caused this.
[00:42:51.906 --> 00:42:53.367]  Now, technically, it's true.
[00:42:55.209 --> 00:42:59.212]  What Bill Gates said when he said, well, the main reason was the gas plants failed.
[00:42:59.472 --> 00:43:00.814]  Yeah, because the wind doesn't work.
[00:43:01.334 --> 00:43:04.597]  And two reactors doesn't run the state of Texas, a nuclear reactor.
[00:43:04.837 --> 00:43:06.479]  They shut down the other ones because they were too old.
[00:43:07.455 --> 00:43:11.137]  The Houston one should be shut down, too, because they're supposed to only run 30 years.
[00:43:11.177 --> 00:43:12.378]  They've been running 42 years.
[00:43:12.998 --> 00:43:19.122]  And then we have all these gas-powered plants that don't operate in the cold because it's not very powerful!
[00:43:19.142 --> 00:43:22.304]  I'm going to explain that again.
[00:43:22.384 --> 00:43:26.206]  We couldn't bring these generators in the office because they put off carbon monoxide.
[00:43:26.266 --> 00:43:26.746]  It'd kill us.
[00:43:27.107 --> 00:43:28.027]  We had to put them outside.
[00:43:28.528 --> 00:43:31.629]  And in 20-degree weather, the damn things wouldn't work.
[00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:33.851]  And we're conking out forever!
[00:43:34.966 --> 00:43:41.051]  So we were off the air for a while after the batteries failed until we basically waited until a place opened that had generators.
[00:43:41.372 --> 00:43:43.474]  They were closed, went and paid them extra to get one.
[00:43:43.494 --> 00:43:45.155]  It's unbelievable.
[00:43:45.175 --> 00:43:46.376]  I'm going to show it all to you when we come back.
[00:43:46.396 --> 00:43:49.999]  I'm going to play you the Obama-Biden.
[00:43:50.019 --> 00:43:51.981]  It's the same person, the same global situation.
[00:43:52.201 --> 00:43:53.362]  The country's under attack.
[00:43:53.643 --> 00:43:54.844]  China has plenty of power.
[00:43:54.864 --> 00:43:56.946]  They're shutting our power off so we can't do business.
[00:43:56.966 --> 00:43:58.187]  Hour 2 straight ahead.
[00:43:59.261 --> 00:44:25.170]  For those trapped in the frozen bureaucratic hell in Texas known as the 2021 Winter Storm, a world where the leadership failed beyond imagination, the largest lesson learned from those that endured the experience is that if they can't manage a full-scale natural and energy disaster, what makes anyone think that they can manage our lives with their Build Back Better Great Reset Takeover of all human existence?
[00:44:25.410 --> 00:44:26.832]  Build back better than before.
[00:44:26.932 --> 00:44:27.893]  Build back better.
[00:44:28.034 --> 00:44:30.457]  Build back better.
[00:44:30.617 --> 00:44:32.119]  And building back better.
[00:44:32.179 --> 00:44:33.261]  Build back better.
[00:44:33.561 --> 00:44:39.029]  The second plan can build back better, advances racial equity by mobilizing our infrastructure.
[00:44:39.694 --> 00:44:40.895]  Together we can fix this.
[00:44:41.976 --> 00:44:43.057]  Let's build back better.
[00:44:43.337 --> 00:44:51.384]  Political parasites in Texas like Austin Mayor Steve Adler who hid for the first three days until the media scared him out of his hole.
[00:44:52.225 --> 00:44:57.749]  I've talked to some folks down in Austin who their frustration about it is
[00:44:58.550 --> 00:45:03.832]  They're not getting any information about, okay, when is restoration coming?
[00:45:04.452 --> 00:45:05.672]  What is the situation?
[00:45:05.692 --> 00:45:14.355]  It seems as if residents have a grasp of the power situation, but people feel they don't have a grasp on the water situation.
[00:45:14.395 --> 00:45:15.095]  What can you do?
[00:45:15.375 --> 00:45:21.697]  We don't have any good answers because we can't give people an exact time when the water's going to be able to come back.
[00:45:22.077 --> 00:45:24.059]  What's the situation in Austin right now?
[00:45:24.679 --> 00:45:27.321]  It's pretty dire in the city right now.
[00:45:27.742 --> 00:45:31.545]  Somebody needs to explain what it is that happened here.
[00:45:31.825 --> 00:45:39.271]  While Senator Ted Cruz and Governor Abbott revealed a disconnect few expected, realizing zero on the ground initiative.
[00:45:40.912 --> 00:45:43.833]  And I want to let you know what these experts told us.
[00:45:43.893 --> 00:45:44.193]  They said,
[00:46:10.663 --> 00:46:19.426]  Five days before the winter storm hit, ERCOT assured that, quote, we are ready for the cold temperatures coming our way.
[00:46:20.106 --> 00:46:26.588]  They also said that ERCOT had issued a notice to power plants to ensure that they were winterized properly.
[00:46:27.349 --> 00:46:34.371]  And ERCOT's annual winter assessment, which was designed to ensure the state is prepared
[00:46:35.086 --> 00:46:42.416]  That assessment assured the public of Texas that there would be enough power to meet peak demand this winter.
[00:46:43.237 --> 00:46:47.924]  Now what happened is, ERCOT fell short on all three of these promises they made.
[00:46:48.084 --> 00:46:51.549]  Meanwhile, as the streets and temperatures remained frozen...
[00:47:00.583 --> 00:47:03.005]  All right, this is one of Bound's longer reports.
[00:47:03.305 --> 00:47:04.446]  It's about seven minutes long.
[00:47:04.546 --> 00:47:05.527]  It's at band.video.
[00:47:05.627 --> 00:47:06.628]  I suggest you share it.
[00:47:06.648 --> 00:47:09.510]  It gets really powerful and explains what's really behind this.
[00:47:09.590 --> 00:47:12.872]  It's darkwinterhell at band.video.
[00:47:12.952 --> 00:47:17.656]  Click the left-hand corner and just find the John Bound area and you'll find those reports.
[00:47:18.336 --> 00:47:21.899]  And again, this is one of the shows where I over prepared.
[00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:28.444]  I've just, and my wife understands now, I just basically work all the time now and I'm not complaining.
[00:47:29.025 --> 00:47:29.325]  I just
[00:47:30.373 --> 00:47:39.297]  But then I get up here and I'm already so angry and so frustrated and I've already read so much of this that I just feel like I'm not doing a good job constantly and I'm mad at myself.
[00:47:39.858 --> 00:47:42.779]  Then I project that on the crew, on air and off air.
[00:47:42.799 --> 00:47:44.500]  I'm a jerk, so I apologize for being a jerk.
[00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:48.082]  But at a certain point too, ladies and gentlemen, most people would run and hide.
[00:47:48.562 --> 00:47:49.282]  Okay, and I get it.
[00:47:49.322 --> 00:47:50.503]  The public keeps running and hiding.
[00:47:50.743 --> 00:47:51.864]  My crew isn't running and hiding.
[00:47:51.884 --> 00:47:52.784]  You're not running and hiding.
[00:47:53.224 --> 00:47:56.346]  We just have to start putting heat on these people legally and lawfully.
[00:47:56.646 --> 00:47:58.127]  But I want to start getting some
[00:47:59.585 --> 00:48:00.266]  What's going on?
[00:48:20.009 --> 00:48:23.752]  And so Gates is right that technically it's because the gas plants failed.
[00:48:23.772 --> 00:48:24.872]  That was the final reason.
[00:48:24.993 --> 00:48:27.674]  Because we get most of our damn power from natural gas!
[00:48:27.855 --> 00:48:29.316]  Because it's what's plentiful and cheap!
[00:48:29.696 --> 00:48:31.597]  It just doesn't work as good.
[00:48:31.977 --> 00:48:33.118]  It'll cook your eggs.
[00:48:34.379 --> 00:48:35.840]  It'll make a nice fireplace for you.
[00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:40.864]  But it doesn't explode in an engine right to drive pistons or turn a frickin' turbine!
[00:48:41.604 --> 00:48:43.486]  And it sure as hell doesn't work in the cold!
[00:48:44.086 --> 00:48:46.688]  Only diesel and gasoline powers through it!
[00:48:48.666 --> 00:48:50.127]  I think the Germans have diesel!
[00:48:50.147 --> 00:48:51.187]  It's even better than gas!
[00:48:51.207 --> 00:48:52.448]  In the damn cold!
[00:48:53.148 --> 00:48:54.349]  The other stuff doesn't work!
[00:48:55.370 --> 00:49:03.714]  Be right back.
[00:49:03.754 --> 00:49:07.857]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:49:08.617 --> 00:49:10.098]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:49:11.141 --> 00:49:13.122]  Well, radio listeners can find the video.
[00:49:13.162 --> 00:49:16.823]  It's posted at band.video and newswars.com and infowars.com.
[00:49:17.283 --> 00:49:21.404]  TV viewers on a lot of radio and a lot of TV stations, a lot of cable stations out there can see it.
[00:49:22.805 --> 00:49:24.765]  But I had an idea for a video meme.
[00:49:24.825 --> 00:49:25.726]  It's only a minute long.
[00:49:25.766 --> 00:49:28.847]  Greg Reese did a great job voicing it, one of our great researchers here.
[00:49:29.667 --> 00:49:32.728]  And it's simply, America is running on one engine.
[00:49:33.493 --> 00:49:36.455]  Yeah, that big passenger liner coming in.
[00:49:36.475 --> 00:49:38.176]  I guess it was United.
[00:49:38.717 --> 00:49:40.638]  One of the engines caught on fire, blew up.
[00:49:41.318 --> 00:49:46.262]  Dramatic footage of the fuel, the jet fuel, the kerosene, spilling into the engine.
[00:49:46.302 --> 00:49:47.843]  They were able to land it safely.
[00:49:50.672 --> 00:49:53.155]  America is operating on one engine right now.
[00:49:53.195 --> 00:50:00.862]  We have people that are awake, we have the states, we have some conservative nationalistic populist courts, but that engine's starting to smoke.
[00:50:01.743 --> 00:50:03.925]  And now Joe Biden's cutting the power off to it.
[00:50:04.626 --> 00:50:13.395]  And so when I saw that engine on fire like that, there's a reason you want your plane to have two engines, whether it's prop plane or whether it's a jet engine.
[00:50:14.685 --> 00:50:20.770]  And, you know, smarter folks, you know, have three engines, one up the top, two on the sides, or, you know, four engines, or six engines.
[00:50:21.450 --> 00:50:25.273]  Not like an 18-wheeler's got more tires, because, you know, when you have a blowout, you don't die every time.
[00:50:26.014 --> 00:50:31.098]  When you're going 75 miles an hour down the highway with a big load, with great power comes great responsibility.
[00:50:31.118 --> 00:50:32.819]  Better have more wheels, better have more engines.
[00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:40.986]  But just the allegory of that burning engine of your radio listener, just have that in mind while Greg Reese lays it out.
[00:50:43.683 --> 00:50:51.128]  The image of this airplane's engine burning in flight is quite the allegory for this very moment in time for the United States of America.
[00:50:51.869 --> 00:50:59.955]  After his first month as president, Joe Biden has cancelled the Keystone Pipeline, terminating thousands of jobs and raising fuel prices.
[00:51:00.635 --> 00:51:06.199]  Suspended protection of our bulk power grid, which has already been infiltrated by the CCP.
[00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:14.045]  Nodded presidential support for the CCP's strong arming of Hong Kong, Chinese death camps, and the Uyghur genocide.
[00:51:14.846 --> 00:51:18.588]  Rejoined the Paris Climate Accord to further destroy U.S.
[00:51:18.688 --> 00:51:22.151]  industry while China's industry burns at full throttle.
[00:51:22.611 --> 00:51:27.615]  And rejoined the CCP-run World Health Organization, pushing the COVID-19 hoax.
[00:51:28.956 --> 00:51:32.178]  The federal government has completely fallen to the CCP.
[00:51:32.739 --> 00:51:34.961]  America has lost one of its engines.
[00:51:35.461 --> 00:51:42.806]  It is now up to our one remaining engine, the states, to pull us up before we crash, or at the very least, give us a good landing.
[00:51:43.667 --> 00:51:46.529]  And I wrote that, so that's not his words.
[00:51:47.970 --> 00:51:48.611]  I should have said
[00:51:52.239 --> 00:52:05.264]  God is our remaining engine, and we've got to call out to God to get ourselves politically active, to lead God and direct us, and then reach out to legislatures, local communities, our churches that aren't completely controlled, and say no to this.
[00:52:05.384 --> 00:52:07.205]  I mean, this is out of control.
[00:52:08.925 --> 00:52:20.709]  And if you look at a report Greg Rees and I put out two weeks ago, long before the storm hit, we said, next we'll be rolling blackouts and power shortages around the country because of regulations Joe Biden's putting in.
[00:52:20.829 --> 00:52:21.909]  And that's the formula.
[00:52:22.389 --> 00:52:23.330]  And that's what happened.
[00:52:24.110 --> 00:52:26.131]  These psychos act the same over and over again.
[00:52:26.351 --> 00:52:28.331]  It's why people are like, God, Jones, you're so smart.
[00:52:28.571 --> 00:52:29.472]  Your guests are so smart.
[00:52:29.512 --> 00:52:30.072]  How do you know this?
[00:52:32.179 --> 00:52:39.683]  How do cops, how do detectives that have been following a serial killer for 10, 15, 20 years finally catch him on the scene when he's killing somebody?
[00:52:40.243 --> 00:52:44.245]  Because they've been tracking him for 20 years, folks, and they start to see patterns.
[00:52:45.025 --> 00:52:46.366]  And it's the same thing with these globalists.
[00:52:46.706 --> 00:52:51.188]  And then they write books and white papers admitting they're shutting off the U.S.
[00:52:51.228 --> 00:52:57.171]  to teach us political control, to teach us how to be poor, and to make us be dependent on the state so they can make us become globalists.
[00:52:57.793 --> 00:53:01.954]  They admit they want to confiscate all your semi-automatics, including hunting shotguns!
[00:53:02.274 --> 00:53:04.014]  It's all being announced!
[00:53:05.674 --> 00:53:07.455]  And so I'm sorry it's dystopic.
[00:53:09.275 --> 00:53:11.295]  But only admitting how much trouble we're in is going to fix it.
[00:53:11.375 --> 00:53:13.436]  Now, they're just now finishing the report.
[00:53:14.216 --> 00:53:15.616]  It ends up, it's 20 minutes long.
[00:53:15.636 --> 00:53:16.756]  That'll be the last two segments.
[00:53:17.556 --> 00:53:18.657]  And they're racing to get it done.
[00:53:18.697 --> 00:53:20.337]  It's got so much documentation on it.
[00:53:21.237 --> 00:53:22.677]  I just hope it's ready for the show today.
[00:53:23.277 --> 00:53:25.758]  But man, I'm telling you, we have cracked the case.
[00:53:27.219 --> 00:53:31.660]  It's come out that the Democrats in the Deep State ran the Capitol attack.
[00:53:32.321 --> 00:53:38.782]  They were able to manipulate and provocateur through Q Shaman, not the Q Shaman himself, but the Q Priest.
[00:53:40.223 --> 00:53:47.145]  These Q drops were put out on 8chan and then the people were manipulated to believing that it was actually Trump.
[00:53:47.745 --> 00:53:50.826]  And so we now know that it was Antifa, the Southern Poverty Law Center,
[00:53:52.039 --> 00:53:52.459]  We're good to go.
[00:54:18.550 --> 00:54:24.194]  Of course, Lindsey Graham, I was talking to folks very close to Trump and Trump was getting ready to go on the offense and give a speech.
[00:54:25.695 --> 00:54:33.140]  Not just at CPAC, but I was told Trump was getting ready to speak about what Lindsey Graham told him that Pelosi did know the Democrats were involved.
[00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:34.301]  This is all getting ready to come out.
[00:54:34.961 --> 00:54:41.105]  And so now as soon as Trump was found not guilty, they moved on to Alex Jones and Roger Stone.
[00:54:41.625 --> 00:54:48.290]  And so when I tell you I'm on the inside of this thing, I'm on the inside of being set up and then trying to send me to prison.
[00:54:50.191 --> 00:54:53.794]  But we found out very quickly what they were doing and tried to stop what happened at the Capitol.
[00:54:54.175 --> 00:54:55.736]  We definitely were able to mitigate what happened.
[00:54:56.336 --> 00:55:00.680]  But that is all coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:03.923]  33 after, when we come out of that break, we're going to premiere.
[00:55:03.963 --> 00:55:05.464]  It's not even going to be on Bandot video yet.
[00:55:05.524 --> 00:55:07.225]  Hopefully soon after, so you can share it.
[00:55:08.066 --> 00:55:16.273]  The fact that Democrats admit to staging and launching the January 6 Capitol attack.
[00:55:17.517 --> 00:55:18.538]  They called it an insurrection.
[00:55:18.598 --> 00:55:19.619]  It was a dud.
[00:55:19.679 --> 00:55:20.219]  It failed.
[00:55:20.940 --> 00:55:27.445]  They fooled enough Q people, former high-level FBI, former high-level military, to actually believe they were working for Trump.
[00:55:27.465 --> 00:55:28.666]  That's why they were there with zip ties.
[00:55:28.686 --> 00:55:30.307]  They're like, where's the special forces?
[00:55:31.028 --> 00:55:32.029]  Where's the people?
[00:55:32.049 --> 00:55:33.130]  We're here to arrest Pelosi.
[00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:34.050]  Trump's coming.
[00:55:34.811 --> 00:55:39.955]  So they tricked Trump to say, go have an event, go have a peaceful protest, a march to the Capitol.
[00:55:40.235 --> 00:55:46.660]  Then they set up to the Q operators, well-meaning people believing that they were actually going
[00:55:47.762 --> 00:55:50.103]  to save the country with Trump in a violent overthrow.
[00:55:50.323 --> 00:55:51.623]  And then they kept the PR going.
[00:55:51.903 --> 00:55:53.464]  Oh, it's going to happen on the 20th.
[00:55:53.824 --> 00:55:56.245]  You know, Biden will be executed on the stage.
[00:55:56.265 --> 00:55:57.625]  And I'm like, it's not true.
[00:55:58.105 --> 00:55:58.865]  It's a lie.
[00:55:58.905 --> 00:56:00.026]  It's a setup by them.
[00:56:00.306 --> 00:56:01.366]  They want permanent troops.
[00:56:02.346 --> 00:56:17.051]  And thank God we were able to snafu a whole bunch of their operatives that they had infiltrated in the Boogaloos, the Oath Keepers and in the Proud Boys, which are not bad organizations, the Oath Keepers and the
[00:56:19.892 --> 00:56:34.917]  And the Proud Boys, and the Boogaloos aren't even bad people on average, but even though they admit they take Antifa in and that Antifa is now using them, but that's the groups they used through those groups online to tell them they were part of this big overthrow and that it was all magic and it was all this great moment with Trump.
[00:56:35.357 --> 00:56:44.720]  And so they got just like six people from Oath Keepers, three or four from the Proud Boys to go in after Antifa broke through
[00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:48.302]  And to go into the Capitol, and the Q people were all swaggering.
[00:56:48.602 --> 00:56:50.744]  Hell, Trump's about to be here, you're all going to prison.
[00:56:51.064 --> 00:56:54.286]  You know, they said a prayer at the dais, they walked between the velvet ropes.
[00:56:55.027 --> 00:56:56.387]  Maybe 20 people were violent.
[00:56:57.989 --> 00:56:59.409]  And they were like, hey, we're here with Trump!
[00:57:00.070 --> 00:57:04.393]  It's alright, cops are on your side, we're about to... And so the media didn't know how to spin it.
[00:57:04.453 --> 00:57:05.954]  First they're like, oh yeah, it was all pre-planned.
[00:57:05.974 --> 00:57:08.356]  They go, wait a minute, we're blaming Trump saying he incited it.
[00:57:09.215 --> 00:57:20.137]  So then when he wasn't convicted of that, which Trump had no idea what was going on, he was set up like I was, then they had to shift gears and go, okay, it is a pre-planned group, and it's Alex Jones and Roger Stone, you got a problem.
[00:57:20.317 --> 00:57:22.878]  You ran your fat mouths in the Time Magazine article.
[00:57:23.518 --> 00:57:26.159]  And then we caught your people on tape admitting they did it.
[00:57:26.579 --> 00:57:30.960]  So get ready, get ready, get ready, throw me in that briar patch.
[00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:35.901]  Because it's all coming out, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:37.369 --> 00:57:42.051]  It's just like in Arlington Road how they set up Jeff Bridges' character to be there when the bomb goes off.
[00:57:42.452 --> 00:57:46.854]  He's there thinking he's stopping the bomb, but he ends up being lured to the site to be blamed for it.
[00:57:46.894 --> 00:57:48.034]  That's how these groups operate.
[00:57:48.054 --> 00:57:49.095]  It's very sophisticated.
[00:57:49.815 --> 00:57:51.236]  But here's the problem with complex plans.
[00:57:52.162 --> 00:57:53.163]  They often go astray.
[00:57:53.563 --> 00:57:56.044]  The best laid plans of mice and men often go astray.
[00:57:56.664 --> 00:57:58.005]  And that is exactly what happened here.
[00:57:58.025 --> 00:57:59.006]  It was supposed to be big.
[00:57:59.026 --> 00:58:00.527]  It was supposed to be a shootout.
[00:58:00.547 --> 00:58:02.227]  It was supposed to be arresting Pelosi.
[00:58:02.247 --> 00:58:04.789]  It was supposed to go engage the Capitol Police.
[00:58:05.289 --> 00:58:10.192]  And then notice now, General Honore blamed the Capitol Police.
[00:58:10.232 --> 00:58:11.512]  That's the one part I forgot to put in my report.
[00:58:12.513 --> 00:58:14.674]  General Honore's like, they're all white supremacists.
[00:58:14.914 --> 00:58:15.835]  They were in on it.
[00:58:17.779 --> 00:58:18.560]  Can you believe that?
[00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:23.505]  Because they know that they were ordered to stand down, that Pelosi had a report two weeks before, a week before, the day before.
[00:58:24.684 --> 00:58:26.845]  They want to have the purge, the military and police.
[00:58:26.925 --> 00:58:29.047]  So, Honoré probably was in charge of all this.
[00:58:29.087 --> 00:58:32.809]  And that's what the research points at with the Southern Poverty Law Center, CIA and others.
[00:58:32.829 --> 00:58:34.310]  That's the groups that run this, that are connected.
[00:58:34.370 --> 00:58:35.531]  CNN, heavily involved.
[00:58:35.571 --> 00:58:36.291]  I said that day one.
[00:58:36.712 --> 00:58:40.054]  Now we know they paid the main commander that went in with the CNN reporters embedded.
[00:58:40.794 --> 00:58:44.877]  And that's why Honoré doesn't want to get in trouble himself, so he's blaming the police.
[00:58:45.978 --> 00:58:46.618]  What a traitor.
[00:58:46.638 --> 00:58:47.819]  What a sack of filth.
[00:58:48.079 --> 00:58:48.679]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:48.699 --> 00:58:49.080]  Stay with us.
[00:59:00.103 --> 00:59:06.469]  You know, I don't blame folks that just want to go out.
[00:59:06.509 --> 00:59:07.990]  Forget this whole New World Order exists.
[00:59:08.010 --> 00:59:11.213]  They're going to come for you on your farms.
[00:59:11.913 --> 00:59:13.675]  They're going to come for you on your ranches.
[00:59:13.695 --> 00:59:18.639]  They're going to come for you in your businesses and in your schools and your churches.
[00:59:18.659 --> 00:59:23.463]  They're going to come for you in your homes, in your gun safe, in your pocketbook.
[00:59:24.004 --> 00:59:24.804]  And they're not going to stop.
[00:59:24.824 --> 00:59:27.407]  They're going to come for you in your children's minds and souls.
[00:59:29.209 --> 00:59:36.053]  And so I worked yesterday and today on this report that they are transferring over right now to our computers that they just finished.
[00:59:36.153 --> 00:59:37.854]  Hopefully it'll be ready by the start of the next segment.
[00:59:38.394 --> 00:59:41.936]  It's about a 19-minute report, so it'll air during the time we have left.
[00:59:41.976 --> 00:59:45.478]  But if it doesn't, it'll air during Sunday Live that Owen hosts.
[00:59:46.377 --> 00:59:48.778]  That even has commercials because we only do local commercials.
[00:59:49.979 --> 00:59:51.460]  I'm syndicated through GCN.
[00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:52.200]  I still love them.
[00:59:52.220 --> 00:59:52.780]  They're good guys.
[00:59:52.821 --> 00:59:55.202]  So I let them still have network ads.
[00:59:55.222 --> 01:00:01.585]  If I had my brothers, I'll be the first talk show host ever to get rid of network ads where the stations have all the ads and we have none.
[01:00:01.605 --> 01:00:04.047]  And we just do a short plug each hour live.
[01:00:04.987 --> 01:00:07.209]  On air, like all the other hosts do every segment.
[01:00:07.349 --> 01:00:08.289]  We do it about once an hour.
[01:00:09.090 --> 01:00:15.555]  But because that show's not syndicated over GCN, we're able to only give you six minutes of ads an hour.
[01:00:16.435 --> 01:00:18.657]  Whereas we have the average for talk radio, 14 minutes.
[01:00:18.697 --> 01:00:23.000]  But regardless, it'll be posted to Band.Video.
[01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:28.484]  It needs to go viral because the Democrats have confessed to staging the Capitol attack.
[01:00:28.524 --> 01:00:34.088]  And I remember when it happened, I said, why is General Honore, the guy that did the gun confiscation in Katrina,
[01:00:35.672 --> 01:00:42.577]  On the news, on January 6th, saying the police are complicit and they're white supremacist.
[01:00:43.938 --> 01:00:48.582]  I mean, the Capitol Police are very professional, very politically correct, and about half of them are black.
[01:00:50.323 --> 01:00:51.344]  I mean, that's just crazy.
[01:00:52.224 --> 01:00:53.905]  They were told to go do traffic control.
[01:00:53.945 --> 01:00:55.106]  They had half their regular number.
[01:00:55.126 --> 01:00:58.028]  The city of DC, the district, is in control of them.
[01:00:59.089 --> 01:00:59.710]  That ought to change.
[01:00:59.750 --> 01:01:01.851]  I think the feds ought to have their own police there.
[01:01:04.301 --> 01:01:05.783]  A couple hundred people were able to break in.
[01:01:07.705 --> 01:01:08.766]  And the police showed restraint.
[01:01:08.826 --> 01:01:15.033]  And then when other people came in, once the crowd started coming in, because they didn't know what just happened a hundred yards in front of them, I didn't know what was going on.
[01:01:15.053 --> 01:01:15.994]  I was 300 yards back.
[01:01:17.916 --> 01:01:25.224]  Then once there's hundreds more coming in, okay, the cops shook hands, took selfies, and those people stayed within the velvet ropes.
[01:01:26.340 --> 01:01:31.962]  We've got all this other big news here, folks, but there's 30,000 National Guard troops stationed there basically permanently.
[01:01:32.502 --> 01:01:35.083]  Biden says the mask never comes off even if he had the vaccine.
[01:01:35.303 --> 01:01:36.564]  He said that Friday at Pfizer.
[01:01:38.124 --> 01:01:39.405]  This is a serious takeover.
[01:01:39.885 --> 01:01:40.845]  This is martial law.
[01:01:41.065 --> 01:01:44.806]  When you're wearing a face diaper, keep your piehole shut, you're in a tyranny.
[01:01:44.826 --> 01:01:46.287]  You're in a science fiction movie, brother.
[01:01:46.307 --> 01:01:52.749]  When you're not allowed to criticize it online or you'll get banned, even if you're a medical doctor, you're not in a free country anymore.
[01:01:52.929 --> 01:01:54.930]  And they're mopping up the final OACs.
[01:01:57.125 --> 01:01:58.686]  The final watering holes of truth.
[01:01:59.326 --> 01:02:02.568]  And InfoWars is one of the biggest last standing organizations.
[01:02:03.148 --> 01:02:05.229]  It's been a great honor to serve with all of you here.
[01:02:05.569 --> 01:02:06.670]  Today could be our last show.
[01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:07.470]  Next week, next month.
[01:02:07.931 --> 01:02:12.833]  But there's a quickening happening where more people are listening than ever have before.
[01:02:12.853 --> 01:02:13.954]  And it's magic what's going on.
[01:02:15.315 --> 01:02:16.515]  I don't care about Hollywood.
[01:02:16.555 --> 01:02:18.216]  I don't care about being part of the power structure.
[01:02:18.256 --> 01:02:19.497]  I don't live in LA or New York.
[01:02:19.857 --> 01:02:21.198]  I don't try to be close to the power.
[01:02:22.415 --> 01:02:26.319]  But the people that aren't part of the power structure, but that are popular, they love my show.
[01:02:26.739 --> 01:02:28.581]  I think my show is unwatchable half the time.
[01:02:29.042 --> 01:02:31.284]  But the biggest names out there love my show.
[01:02:31.945 --> 01:02:34.227]  I know Rush Limbaugh, I was told, listened every night.
[01:02:35.088 --> 01:02:37.110]  I know Matt Drudge listens basically 24-7.
[01:02:37.571 --> 01:02:41.815]  I know that other people, the big guy on Fox is a big listener and a big viewer.
[01:02:41.855 --> 01:02:42.396]  I'll leave it at that.
[01:02:42.876 --> 01:02:43.977]  Talked to him just the other day.
[01:02:43.997 --> 01:02:46.000]  And it goes on and on.
[01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:46.961]  Steven Crowder.
[01:02:47.161 --> 01:02:48.082]  The list goes on and on.
[01:02:48.983 --> 01:02:51.265]  But listen, that's not a power trip for me.
[01:02:51.706 --> 01:02:52.947]  That is a great honor.
[01:02:53.528 --> 01:02:58.994]  And it shows, and I'm only giving a report card to you, the boss, the listeners, the providers, the ones that keep us on air.
[01:02:59.394 --> 01:03:00.555]  Thank you for what you've done.
[01:03:00.576 --> 01:03:02.377]  Because I'll be steadfast in the end.
[01:03:03.502 --> 01:03:04.503]  I just want to fight the globalists.
[01:03:04.603 --> 01:03:05.483]  I want to defeat them.
[01:03:06.124 --> 01:03:16.531]  I have an absolute commitment to stop them, but instead of it creating a power trip, I just feel terrible because we're not doing more to turn the tide, and I'm just very frustrated.
[01:03:16.571 --> 01:03:19.613]  But out of that frustration, I know we're going to get the victory we need.
[01:03:19.813 --> 01:03:20.474]  So let me show you this.
[01:03:20.514 --> 01:03:26.358]  Since I mentioned it, I don't want to just say something and then not show it to you, because this is the one thing I forgot in the report coming up.
[01:03:28.297 --> 01:03:40.952]  General Honore, who's running the gun confiscation national threat assessment plan to go after the American people, who says we need to put millions of Trump people in prison, take our guns, put us on no-fly list, arrest members of Congress.
[01:03:41.253 --> 01:03:43.796]  I mean, this guy's like Hitler reborn or something.
[01:03:45.265 --> 01:03:48.067]  But I guess it's okay, because his great-great-great-great-grandfather was black.
[01:03:48.507 --> 01:03:52.190]  Again, he looks about as black as the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback.
[01:03:52.570 --> 01:03:54.171]  Like, Tom Brady's racist!
[01:03:54.191 --> 01:03:54.752]  He beat him!
[01:03:55.472 --> 01:03:58.154]  It's like saying Elizabeth Warren is a Native American.
[01:03:58.475 --> 01:03:59.435]  It's just—anyways.
[01:03:59.695 --> 01:04:04.699]  The point is, General Honore wants your guns.
[01:04:04.759 --> 01:04:10.183]  And we already showed you last hour how he ran the confiscation in Katrina, back many, many years ago.
[01:04:11.264 --> 01:04:13.986]  But now, look at this headline.
[01:04:15.134 --> 01:04:32.401]  Russell Honore, Pelosi's pick for Capitol Security Review, claimed police were complicit in the riot and six police are under criminal investigation because when a mob of people came up to one guy and wanted to take a photo, he doesn't know what's about to happen, so okay, I'll take a photo.
[01:04:32.441 --> 01:04:33.701]  They ordered the stand down.
[01:04:34.082 --> 01:04:35.662]  So how is the individual officer to blame?
[01:04:35.742 --> 01:04:36.563]  It's not true.
[01:04:36.623 --> 01:04:37.143]  It's a fraud.
[01:04:38.524 --> 01:04:40.885]  But see, Honore knows that Pelosi was warned.
[01:04:41.165 --> 01:04:43.406]  Honore knows Time Magazine bragged they knew it was coming.
[01:04:43.566 --> 01:04:44.427]  They know they infiltrated.
[01:04:44.487 --> 01:04:45.207]  He knows this!
[01:04:45.727 --> 01:04:47.588]  He's the type of guy probably in command of it!
[01:04:47.928 --> 01:04:49.669]  Hell, he ran gun confiscation in Katrina!
[01:04:50.510 --> 01:04:56.112]  He's an America-hating, gun-hating, God-hating sack of garbage.
[01:04:56.332 --> 01:04:59.254]  The general they want to lead the takedown of America.
[01:04:59.514 --> 01:05:02.315]  Ladies and gentlemen, you have met your Benedict Arnold.
[01:05:02.835 --> 01:05:04.336]  General Russell Honore.
[01:05:04.796 --> 01:05:05.957]  A disgusting joke.
[01:05:07.554 --> 01:05:09.375]  And here he is saying the police?
[01:05:10.937 --> 01:05:16.001]  Remember he said why he goes up to 30% of the Capitol police are white.
[01:05:18.323 --> 01:05:25.669]  It's like Cartoon Network has a PSA telling children to seek color and to become anti-racist preachers and that whites shouldn't exist.
[01:05:28.243 --> 01:05:32.045]  Man, I mean, this is sick Civil War garbage, folks.
[01:05:32.265 --> 01:05:33.246]  So he wants to be arrested?
[01:05:33.326 --> 01:05:34.087]  I bet he does!
[01:05:34.627 --> 01:05:36.208]  I don't care, you piece of filth!
[01:05:36.688 --> 01:05:40.511]  You're the one that needs to be arrested for gun confiscation in Katrina, you monster!
[01:05:40.531 --> 01:05:44.653]  Why don't you stop Obama's sex trafficking of kids that just started back up on the border?
[01:05:44.833 --> 01:05:46.754]  That's in the Senate report, you little monster!
[01:05:47.075 --> 01:05:47.655]  Walk around with your
[01:05:47.915 --> 01:05:51.738]  Your beret on, your glasses, your cigar, like you're George Patton.
[01:05:52.098 --> 01:05:53.459]  You didn't go up against the Nazis.
[01:05:53.959 --> 01:05:59.103]  You went up against the American people and took their guns when they were freezing in their houses, you traitor, you enemy.
[01:06:00.244 --> 01:06:01.144]  There's another enemy.
[01:06:02.585 --> 01:06:06.929]  Our Islamic Lord and Chief, in his third term, dismantling the country.
[01:06:07.169 --> 01:06:08.830]  Now he's got an old front man to do it.
[01:06:09.671 --> 01:06:11.011]  Barack Obama saying,
[01:06:12.014 --> 01:06:18.371]  In 2012, 2013, that he's gonna get your coal, and gonna turn your power off.
[01:06:18.672 --> 01:06:20.256]  And he did it, and that's why you're in the cold.
[01:06:20.296 --> 01:06:20.677]  Here it is.
[01:06:22.796 --> 01:06:26.358]  Let me sort of describe my overall policy.
[01:06:27.118 --> 01:06:35.741]  What I've said is that we would put a cap-and-trade system in place that is as aggressive, if not more aggressive, than anybody else's out there.
[01:06:35.861 --> 01:06:47.446]  I was the first to call for a 100% auction on the cap-and-trade system, which means that every unit of carbon or greenhouse gas that was emitted would be charged to the polluter.
[01:06:48.584 --> 01:07:05.635]  That will create a market in which whatever technologies are out there that are being presented, whatever power plants that are being built, that they would have to meet the rigors of that market and the ratcheted down caps that are placed, imposed every year.
[01:07:06.335 --> 01:07:08.757]  So if somebody wants to build a coal-powered plant, they can.
[01:07:09.397 --> 01:07:17.222]  It's just that it will bankrupt them because they're going to be charged a huge sum for all that greenhouse gas that's being emitted.
[01:07:18.357 --> 01:07:19.717]  And where does the money go?
[01:07:19.797 --> 01:07:23.178]  He actually owns the Chicago Mercantile Exchange part for carbon.
[01:07:23.458 --> 01:07:23.819]  That's right.
[01:07:24.159 --> 01:07:26.359]  The Clintons and Obama and the Rothschilds make the money.
[01:07:26.379 --> 01:07:30.880]  Oh, isn't that cutesy footsy?
[01:07:31.281 --> 01:07:32.881]  We'll be back with the big special report.
[01:07:32.901 --> 01:07:33.741]  We've cracked the case.
[01:07:34.001 --> 01:07:35.982]  The Democrats admit they launched the attack on the Capitol.
[01:07:37.591 --> 01:07:38.332]  Big Brother.
[01:07:39.292 --> 01:07:40.573]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:41.634 --> 01:07:42.734]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:43.415 --> 01:07:44.856]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:07:45.476 --> 01:07:46.837]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:47.638 --> 01:07:52.321]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:07:53.021 --> 01:08:02.044]  Lieutenant General Russell Honore has been brought out of retirement by President Obama and Nancy Pelosi to prepare to prosecute war and gun confiscation nationwide.
[01:08:02.684 --> 01:08:14.548]  He is now saying that they have six police officers are suspended in the Capitol, 35 under investigation, claiming they launched the attack on the Capitol when all evidence is the Democratic Party launched it.
[01:08:14.568 --> 01:08:16.049]  You're about to see that evidence.
[01:08:16.349 --> 01:08:18.689]  That's why Senator Graham said, what did Pelosi know?
[01:08:18.990 --> 01:08:19.630]  When did they know it?
[01:08:19.650 --> 01:08:19.970]  It's why they
[01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:22.992]  Mark your calendars, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:23.292 --> 01:08:24.714]  We now know who pre-planned the attack on the U.S.
[01:08:24.734 --> 01:08:25.694]  Capitol from their own words.
[01:08:25.714 --> 01:08:27.016]  Because again, criminals love to brag.
[01:08:47.031 --> 01:08:50.653]  I never thought I'd be in a real live episode of Magnum P.I.
[01:08:50.753 --> 01:08:51.474]  or Columbo.
[01:08:51.494 --> 01:08:54.956]  I guess Perry Mason comes to mind, but I am.
[01:08:56.156 --> 01:08:58.518]  National headlines everywhere the last two days.
[01:08:58.758 --> 01:09:07.303]  Alex Jones and Roger Stone under criminal investigation to see if we pre-planned the Capitol insurrection attack.
[01:09:08.203 --> 01:09:12.506]  Now let's unpack that here for just a moment, and then I'm going to give you the big news.
[01:09:13.166 --> 01:09:16.068]  We actually know exactly who carried out the pre-planning
[01:09:17.449 --> 01:09:24.924]  of the Capitol attack on January 6 and we have it from their own words in print and on video and with audio.
[01:09:24.944 --> 01:09:25.786]  We're going to show you.
[01:09:26.670 --> 01:09:31.996]  Who took credit and who got $70,000 from CNN and from NBC.
[01:09:32.416 --> 01:09:34.038]  So that's all coming up in a moment.
[01:09:34.298 --> 01:09:47.632]  But first let me briefly address the claim by the Washington Post and others that Roger Stone and myself are some of the chief suspects in the pre-planned attack on the Capitol.
[01:10:03.172 --> 01:10:07.302]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:10:08.476 --> 01:10:19.523]  We were told by all the Democratic leaders, by the entire corporate media, not just here but across the world, that President Trump summoned a mob of a million violent criminals to D.C.
[01:10:19.883 --> 01:10:21.825]  to illegally challenge a U.S.
[01:10:21.885 --> 01:10:22.265]  election.
[01:10:22.285 --> 01:10:23.266]  You're not supposed to do that.
[01:10:23.786 --> 01:10:32.652]  And that he then directed them to attack the Capitol, and all one million went in and ransacked and murdered people, and it was the most violent thing to happen on U.S.
[01:10:32.692 --> 01:10:34.133]  soil since Pearl Harbor.
[01:10:34.873 --> 01:10:36.795]  Chuckie Schumer and others called it Pearl Harbor.
[01:10:36.995 --> 01:10:38.556]  They compared it to World War II.
[01:10:38.876 --> 01:10:40.017]  They compared it to 9-11.
[01:10:40.498 --> 01:10:42.740]  And they said that, again, it was not premeditated.
[01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:51.427]  President Trump was the only one that premeditated it by getting that crowd there and then hyping them up as a rabble rouser to attack the building.
[01:10:52.088 --> 01:10:52.828]  But he was acquitted.
[01:10:53.829 --> 01:11:05.977]  Over a week ago, in the US Senate, because there was no evidence of this, they played all the video of the Democrats standing up there saying things far worse than Trump even dreamed of saying, like Cuomo saying, whoever said riots are peaceful?
[01:11:06.417 --> 01:11:09.119]  And Pelosi saying burning things down is just what people do.
[01:11:09.619 --> 01:11:16.643]  President Franklin Roosevelt set aside December 7th, 1941 as a day that will live in infamy.
[01:11:17.884 --> 01:11:18.604]  Unfortunately,
[01:11:19.639 --> 01:11:29.890]  We can now add January 6th, 2021 to that very short list of dates in American history that will live forever in infamy.
[01:11:30.791 --> 01:11:35.296]  And please, show me where it says that protests are supposed to be polite and peaceful.
[01:11:35.416 --> 01:11:37.057]  People will do what they do.
[01:11:37.098 --> 01:11:39.780]  When you're in the arena, you gotta be ready to take a punch.
[01:11:40.882 --> 01:11:42.463]  You gotta be ready to throw a punch.
[01:11:42.984 --> 01:11:44.706]  There's hundreds of those clips, we all know them.
[01:11:45.186 --> 01:11:46.247]  And so they had to acquit him.
[01:11:47.108 --> 01:11:54.134]  And the ink wasn't dry on Trump's acquittal until they turned around and said, actually, it's Roger Stone and Alex Jones.
[01:11:54.695 --> 01:12:00.300]  They're the ones that captained and field-martialed this entire operation, and it was premeditated.
[01:12:01.145 --> 01:12:03.707]  So let's get into the evidence right now.
[01:12:24.878 --> 01:12:33.622]  Coming up, I'm going to show you where the establishment Democrats bragged in Time Magazine just two weeks ago that they indeed set up Trump supporters on the 6th.
[01:12:34.262 --> 01:12:42.766]  But before we get to that piece of smoking gun evidence, let's look at one of the main leaders of the insurrection at the Capitol.
[01:12:43.026 --> 01:12:45.287]  So how was this lady shot?
[01:12:45.847 --> 01:12:51.630]  I mean, she was trying to get through the door and did you see who shot her?
[01:12:53.120 --> 01:13:04.562]  Yeah, so I was getting to that part so immediately after they started breaking through the glass, once they broke through the glass they were using like flag poles and whatever they had to kind of bash through the windows.
[01:13:06.023 --> 01:13:10.504]  On the right hand side, this lady was able to like make her way all the way through the window.
[01:13:11.244 --> 01:13:15.285]  All we see is these guns come out the doorways.
[01:13:15.645 --> 01:13:16.145]  Just guns.
[01:13:17.025 --> 01:13:18.327]  All you can see is their hand.
[01:13:18.347 --> 01:13:18.587]  That's it.
[01:13:18.627 --> 01:13:19.528]  You can see faces.
[01:13:20.189 --> 01:13:22.752]  And right when I saw that, I was yelling at people.
[01:13:22.772 --> 01:13:24.374]  I was like, guys, there's guns, there's guns.
[01:13:24.414 --> 01:13:25.496]  You don't want to go through there.
[01:13:25.936 --> 01:13:27.758]  They were going to shoot.
[01:13:28.359 --> 01:13:30.602]  Not just hold it there and run away.
[01:13:30.702 --> 01:13:32.384]  They were literally going to shoot to kill.
[01:13:32.404 --> 01:13:34.146]  The second that she climbed through the window,
[01:13:34.947 --> 01:13:39.291]  She got shot, like, right in the neck area, fell backwards.
[01:13:39.711 --> 01:13:41.753]  Meet John Sullivan, a.k.a.
[01:13:42.213 --> 01:13:45.295]  Jaden X. His father is a famous U.S.
[01:13:45.315 --> 01:13:46.056]  military general.
[01:13:46.717 --> 01:13:54.643]  On the morning of January 6th, Jaden X was recorded over and over and over again saying, we're gonna go to the Capitol and we're going to burn it down.
[01:13:59.624 --> 01:14:04.526]  But that didn't stop CNN from saying he was an innocent bystander and a journalist.
[01:14:04.926 --> 01:14:09.308]  And it didn't stop CNN and other news outlets from secretly paying him $70,000.
[01:14:09.929 --> 01:14:13.590]  That finally came out in court just last week.
[01:14:16.111 --> 01:14:22.714]  Dude, I was trying to tell you.
[01:14:23.454 --> 01:14:24.274]  I couldn't say much.
[01:14:26.645 --> 01:14:27.632]  You just have to watch my show.
[01:14:29.913 --> 01:14:32.754]  Is this not going to be the best film you've ever made in your life?
[01:14:33.294 --> 01:14:37.936]  The CNN connected film crew that followed Jaden X to the Capitol was blown away.
[01:14:38.196 --> 01:14:42.318]  They couldn't believe that his boast of invading the Capitol and it succeeding came true.
[01:14:43.238 --> 01:14:51.721]  Jaden X had been boasting online and to hundreds of people in the streets that he indeed had helped online plan the attack on the Capitol.
[01:14:52.061 --> 01:14:54.122]  And when confronted with it, he didn't even deny it.
[01:14:54.342 --> 01:14:56.543]  He said that was another one of his personalities.
[01:14:57.629 --> 01:14:58.809]  You can disassociate yourself.
[01:14:59.509 --> 01:15:00.710]  I have John Sullivan.
[01:15:01.110 --> 01:15:03.790]  I have Jaden X. That separates.
[01:15:03.810 --> 01:15:06.131]  I have Insurgents USA, a civil rights organization.
[01:15:06.271 --> 01:15:13.392]  And it's not just Jaden X. Many other known leftist activists from around the country came to D.C.
[01:15:13.732 --> 01:15:17.093]  and posed as Trump supporters and helped rile up the crowd.
[01:15:17.593 --> 01:15:25.635]  While Trump was still speaking a mile and a half away at the Ellipse outside the White House, already over 100,000 people had showed up at the Capitol.
[01:15:26.315 --> 01:15:40.803]  And observant patriots noticed that in the grass, in the bushes, behind the trees, people wearing all black, people with anti-fascist style dress and gear were putting on MAGA gear, putting on Trump gear.
[01:15:41.083 --> 01:15:47.126]  And this again is just more evidence of how the left didn't overtly show up to confront Trump supporters that day.
[01:15:47.486 --> 01:15:50.307]  They simply blended in and added to the hysteria.
[01:15:57.543 --> 01:16:12.712]  In October of last year, investigative journalist Millie Weaver, who had been tracking the Sunrise Project for more than two years, that's basically a college-level, George Soros, Democratic Party-funded group that teaches Antifa and BLM tactics.
[01:16:13.632 --> 01:16:23.698]  Millie got dozens of hours from an inside whistleblower of this organization planning to carry out the exact type of insurrection that then took place on January 6th.
[01:16:24.841 --> 01:16:50.519]  Our undercover inside the Sunrise Movement was able to obtain exclusive video footage inside Zoom chats where Shutdown DC, BLM and other leftist organizations are coordinating a multi-level coup action exercise utilizing insider help from Democrat Party members as well as federal employees and intelligence contractors.
[01:16:51.159 --> 01:16:53.521]  I'm a management and programs analyst.
[01:16:53.841 --> 01:16:54.581]  All right, stay there.
[01:16:54.601 --> 01:17:00.905]  We're going to come back because we have the audio where they admit that we're going to go stage the Capitol attack and we're organizing online.
[01:17:00.945 --> 01:17:02.226]  We're going to blame the Republicans.
[01:17:04.341 --> 01:17:05.502]  I mean, wow!
[01:17:05.522 --> 01:17:07.283]  This is all just now coming out.
[01:17:08.803 --> 01:17:10.104]  It's really got new stuff.
[01:17:10.144 --> 01:17:11.104]  All right, it's all coming up.
[01:17:11.525 --> 01:17:14.146]  Next segment, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[01:17:14.366 --> 01:17:18.108]  The full thing will be posted in the next 15 minutes, the banned-out video.
[01:17:18.328 --> 01:17:20.129]  So share it if you want to stop the globalists.
[01:17:20.349 --> 01:17:21.910]  This is Kryptonite to the New World Order.
[01:17:23.510 --> 01:17:26.391]  All right, so the final segment of my Sunday show will be back tomorrow at 11 a.m.
[01:17:26.411 --> 01:17:27.251]  Central, Lord willing.
[01:17:27.391 --> 01:17:32.812]  Owen Schroeder takes over two hours with Sunday Live, and he's going to end the last five minutes of this report.
[01:17:33.232 --> 01:17:40.733]  We'll have time to air about eight, nine minutes of it now, then he'll air at the very start of his show the conclusion of this report.
[01:17:40.773 --> 01:17:43.614]  In about 20 minutes or so, it'll be posted to band.video.
[01:17:43.934 --> 01:17:46.395]  We just finished it 20 minutes ago or so.
[01:17:46.955 --> 01:17:48.235]  Democrats confess
[01:17:49.622 --> 01:17:52.283]  To staging the Capitol attack on January 6th.
[01:17:52.303 --> 01:17:53.064]  They're so criminal.
[01:17:53.364 --> 01:17:54.344]  They're bragging about it.
[01:17:54.404 --> 01:17:55.045]  It's smoking gun.
[01:17:55.085 --> 01:17:59.267]  It's all come out in the last week and all the final pieces with Millie Weaver's help.
[01:17:59.347 --> 01:18:02.028]  She's always been a great journalist have have have come together.
[01:18:02.709 --> 01:18:19.137]  So let's go ahead and finish with as much as the report as we can get to and then it'll be posted to band out video where if you share it on your email, your text message, your word of mouth posted on your own site, it will shake the globalists of their very foundations because they're launching a new Civil War and a martial law takeover on the back of this lie.
[01:18:21.018 --> 01:18:23.360]  I'm a management and programs analyst.
[01:18:23.820 --> 01:18:26.562]  I work in the national security community.
[01:18:26.762 --> 01:18:33.067]  I spent three and a half years as a contractor at DHS HQ.
[01:18:33.467 --> 01:18:37.069]  If you read the mainstream press, like, they all have Signal accounts.
[01:18:38.086 --> 01:18:39.928]  Text them, leak everything you can.
[01:18:39.948 --> 01:18:46.834]  The journalists I've dealt with have been super ethical in ways to shield me to be the source of the leaks.
[01:18:46.994 --> 01:18:52.139]  Groups on the outside being able to show solidarity with federal workers.
[01:18:52.399 --> 01:18:56.062]  Making sure that we're naming what is happening as a coup.
[01:18:56.543 --> 01:19:01.647]  Totally agreed in the shutdown BC conversations that I've been having and that's not on the federal side.
[01:19:01.687 --> 01:19:04.550]  We also are often saying, like, call it a coup.
[01:19:04.890 --> 01:19:07.552]  They plan to shut down Washington D.C.
[01:19:07.872 --> 01:19:09.373]  and other major U.S.
[01:19:09.453 --> 01:19:13.915]  cities starting November 4th until Inauguration Day.
[01:19:14.116 --> 01:19:16.837]  Do we have any plans for how to respond if there's a coup?
[01:19:17.217 --> 01:19:20.940]  Come to BLM Plaza anytime after 4 p.m.
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:21.720]  on election night.
[01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:25.322]  On the 5th, we're going to shut down the White House.
[01:19:25.482 --> 01:19:27.864]  Map the White House and know every access point.
[01:19:28.584 --> 01:19:30.025]  So we knew we could have blockaded.
[01:19:30.185 --> 01:19:34.768]  On the 6th, we're going to shut down larger parts of Washington, D.C.
[01:19:34.948 --> 01:19:37.989]  We've been working on a target map and a framework for scenario.
[01:19:38.269 --> 01:19:40.411]  So where are all the police stations?
[01:19:40.811 --> 01:19:42.552]  Where are all the key government buildings?
[01:19:42.892 --> 01:19:44.253]  Who are the Trump boosters?
[01:19:44.813 --> 01:19:46.215]  Members of Congress that are coming in.
[01:19:46.235 --> 01:19:47.536]  So this is the insurrection, as you can see.
[01:19:47.556 --> 01:19:49.658]  We're going to leave at the airports or at Union Station.
[01:19:50.559 --> 01:19:55.163]  And send them back to where they came from until we deal with the situation that we're in.
[01:19:55.483 --> 01:19:59.808]  We are going to be in a crisis, but we want it to be one that we are creating.
[01:20:00.088 --> 01:20:02.410]  Whoever's got the guns can win.
[01:20:02.650 --> 01:20:03.651]  Let's take over the buildings.
[01:20:04.132 --> 01:20:06.915]  If there are people that are willing to do that, we should support them.
[01:20:07.095 --> 01:20:08.896]  Get ready to shut your city down on the 4th or the 5th.
[01:20:09.716 --> 01:20:13.578]  Regardless of who wins, the left plans to take over.
[01:20:14.078 --> 01:20:26.545]  And then, on the night of the 6th, Millie Weaver was able to actually confront Jaden X. Hey, so, were you... Are you BLM?
[01:20:26.625 --> 01:20:27.866]  Are you Black Lives Matter?
[01:20:29.927 --> 01:20:35.290]  John, can you just answer, are you Black Lives Matter with Black Lives Matter, or are you with the right wing people?
[01:20:36.010 --> 01:20:37.711]  Yeah, but, are you Black Lives Matter?
[01:20:38.393 --> 01:20:40.114]  Notice he uses the mask to cover himself.
[01:20:40.594 --> 01:20:44.255]  So you just said on the phone that he is not being charged with anything.
[01:20:46.756 --> 01:20:48.837]  Did you say you weren't being charged with anything?
[01:20:48.857 --> 01:20:50.137]  I thought I heard you say that.
[01:20:51.678 --> 01:20:53.058]  Are you Black Lives Matter, John?
[01:20:55.679 --> 01:21:00.601]  I'm of the opinion that what we saw yesterday was very much by design.
[01:21:01.561 --> 01:21:03.522]  That we did have agent provocateurs.
[01:21:04.908 --> 01:21:06.871]  And I'm of the opinion that you're one of them.
[01:21:07.051 --> 01:21:07.451]  Interesting.
[01:21:07.932 --> 01:21:08.913]  Really interesting, I'm not.
[01:21:09.374 --> 01:21:10.936]  Why do you think I'm one of them?
[01:21:10.956 --> 01:21:12.237]  Because of who your father is.
[01:21:12.277 --> 01:21:13.459]  Your father's PsyOps, man.
[01:21:13.579 --> 01:21:15.621]  So, you've met my dad, okay?
[01:21:16.002 --> 01:21:17.383]  So... Kind of.
[01:21:18.504 --> 01:21:19.444]  Further elaborates my point.
[01:21:19.504 --> 01:21:24.406]  Let me just explain to you because I know people are going to storm the Capitol.
[01:21:24.826 --> 01:21:25.547]  I'm on chats.
[01:21:25.607 --> 01:21:26.647]  I'm on underground chats.
[01:21:26.687 --> 01:21:28.428]  Like I have my resources.
[01:21:28.508 --> 01:21:29.408]  I have my resources.
[01:21:29.628 --> 01:21:32.369]  There's not me, but I have people, right?
[01:21:32.569 --> 01:21:35.591]  And I'm not saying some fucking cop type shit.
[01:21:36.011 --> 01:21:44.174]  I'm saying my people in my organization, Insurgents USA, was civil rights group that is Black Lives Matter.
[01:21:45.467 --> 01:21:52.815]  Or if you want to label it in Tifa because Trump wants to label it in Tifa, but I label myself as Insurgent Juse, but for people's context, right?
[01:21:54.713 --> 01:21:56.554]  Yeah, they are in chats.
[01:21:56.594 --> 01:22:00.655]  They can easily give me information on what's going on and staying with everybody else.
[01:22:00.695 --> 01:22:02.135]  But it's a collective of people.
[01:22:02.536 --> 01:22:03.916]  You can disassociate yourself.
[01:22:04.656 --> 01:22:05.797]  I have John Sullivan.
[01:22:06.217 --> 01:22:08.938]  I have Jade and X. That separates.
[01:22:08.958 --> 01:22:11.639]  I have Insurgents USA, a civil rights organization.
[01:22:11.679 --> 01:22:16.960]  So it separates my identity based on the specific role that I'm playing, right?
[01:22:17.300 --> 01:22:18.481]  Is there really a separation?
[01:22:18.781 --> 01:22:19.701]  There is a separation.
[01:22:19.721 --> 01:22:21.262]  There is a separation for sure because
[01:22:23.670 --> 01:22:31.635]  I can't, I can't be in a crowd full of Trump supporters and say f*** the police or say the things that I would during my regular activism.
[01:22:33.776 --> 01:22:44.043]  Now we've looked at some of the smoking gun, caught red-handed, bombshell evidence of the Democratic Party, Soros, and the Deep State manipulating the crowd.
[01:22:44.723 --> 01:22:48.886]  We're going to look at one more piece and then we're going to get to the really sad information.
[01:22:49.566 --> 01:22:50.447]  The fact that some of the
[01:22:51.650 --> 01:22:56.837]  Best organizations in the past in this country, when it came to promoting freedom, were infiltrated.
[01:22:57.438 --> 01:23:01.063]  And it's important to go over this and understand the truth of what happened, so it won't happen again.
[01:23:02.282 --> 01:23:15.008]  Observing Antifa over the last decade or so, we know they're funded by the UN, by George Soros, by the Democrats in Deep State to undermine America, attack free speech, and call anybody that doesn't support that a racist and a Nazi.
[01:23:15.448 --> 01:23:22.731]  They are the equivalent of the left's brown shirts, just like Hitler had those as he stormed to power in the early 1930s in Germany.
[01:23:23.291 --> 01:23:28.954]  But we got a document back in January of 2018 from a family member of high-level Antifa
[01:23:29.674 --> 01:23:33.677]  When he was taking care of him in his house and was able to see the shocking information.
[01:23:34.338 --> 01:23:53.094]  And in the documents that are on screen, they talked about how Obama wanted to trigger martial law nationwide back in 2015 and even put troops in Maryland by using Antifa to go out and try to provoke the black community into rioting and burning down police stations and government buildings.
[01:23:53.714 --> 01:23:54.295]  They failed.
[01:23:54.935 --> 01:24:00.536]  And so the chain reaction did not take place and Obama didn't get to stay in office using martial law.
[01:24:00.996 --> 01:24:04.897]  But that's what Antifa are specialists at and experts.
[01:24:05.377 --> 01:24:10.138]  They even have maps when they go into an area of where they're allowed to attack, what they're going to do.
[01:24:10.518 --> 01:24:18.000]  And it's always done in blue cities and blue states where they're actually working with the mayors and chiefs of police
[01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:25.366]  to go out and carry out this low-intensity terror knowing that they have a get-out-of-jail-free card and are not going to get in trouble.
[01:24:25.586 --> 01:24:34.395]  And if they do get arrested, the charges are almost always dropped and their bail is paid for by the Democratic Party, George Soros, and of course, Hollywood.
[01:24:35.348 --> 01:24:40.010]  And I want to make clear that I know that there are protests still happening in major cities across the United States.
[01:24:40.150 --> 01:24:43.732]  I'm just not seeing the reporting on it that I had for the first few weeks.
[01:24:44.192 --> 01:24:44.652]  That's right.
[01:24:44.752 --> 01:24:45.753]  But they're not going to stop.
[01:24:45.813 --> 01:24:47.633]  They're not going to stop.
[01:24:47.994 --> 01:24:49.774]  This is a movement, I'm telling you.
[01:24:50.075 --> 01:24:51.835]  They're not going to stop.
[01:24:51.995 --> 01:24:55.477]  And everyone beware, because they're not going to stop.
[01:24:55.537 --> 01:24:59.899]  They're not going to stop before Election Day in November, and they're not going to stop after Election Day.
[01:25:00.439 --> 01:25:03.702]  And that should be, everyone should take note of that on both levels.
[01:25:03.882 --> 01:25:06.525]  That this isn't, they're not going to let up and they should not.
[01:25:06.965 --> 01:25:07.886]  And we should not.
[01:25:08.807 --> 01:25:09.647]  So think about that.
[01:25:10.508 --> 01:25:16.293]  A couple hundred people go in the Capitol, maybe 20 of them are somewhat violent, defecate on the floor, beat up some police.
[01:25:16.613 --> 01:25:17.474]  Nobody's defending that.
[01:25:18.095 --> 01:25:20.617]  But they're calling this a Pearl Harbor event.
[01:25:20.937 --> 01:25:22.739]  When you had whole swaths of the U.S.
[01:25:22.779 --> 01:25:24.400]  burned down and you had the now
[01:25:25.669 --> 01:25:31.655]  Vice President helping bail people out that again attack police and burn down police stations.
[01:25:32.396 --> 01:25:33.917]  And we've only scratched the surface here.
[01:25:34.257 --> 01:25:43.667]  You've got a former high-level FBI top security clearance commander of FBI operations, that's confirmed, leading the assault.
[01:25:44.247 --> 01:25:45.849]  You've got the
[01:25:47.128 --> 01:25:55.901]  Son-in-law of Nancy Pelosi inside, and then you've got the cue boards again saying, oh don't worry, Trump's coming back.
[01:25:56.522 --> 01:26:02.931]  The real inauguration is March 4th, so they can hopefully manipulate some more people into doing something violent.
[01:26:03.231 --> 01:26:17.346]  This is extremely dangerous, as you can all see, and as I'm now experiencing, as the entire mainstream corporate media tries to frame myself and Roger Stone and others for what they themselves actually orchestrated on January 6th.
[01:26:18.227 --> 01:26:21.671]  Now, as Paul Harvey would say, here is the rest of the story.
[01:26:23.192 --> 01:26:24.393]  I like Oath Keepers.
[01:26:24.553 --> 01:26:25.414]  I know Stuart Rhodes.
[01:26:25.454 --> 01:26:26.635]  They have a constitutional mission.
[01:26:27.276 --> 01:26:29.939]  He's a great guy and doesn't want offensive violence.
[01:26:30.279 --> 01:26:31.320]  He wants to defend the Republic.
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:32.641]  And most Oath Keepers are great.
[01:26:33.562 --> 01:26:44.512]  But through the Q movement and through these message boards that Jaden X was talking about, they were able to pose as right-wingers through some of the cut-out militia groups like the Bugaloos and others.
[01:26:45.353 --> 01:26:59.925]  And we're able to go into Oath Keepers, go into Proud Boys, and go into some of the Q groups and actually organize people who believe they were coming to the Capitol waiting for Trump to actually show up and lead them in a takeover of the government.
[01:26:59.945 --> 01:27:00.705]  Alright, let's stop right there.
[01:27:01.406 --> 01:27:03.007]  It's the last five minute conclusion.
[01:27:03.067 --> 01:27:04.208]  It's the key to all of it.
[01:27:04.228 --> 01:27:06.210]  The full video will be posted.
[01:27:06.250 --> 01:27:07.331]  It's being uploaded right now.
[01:27:07.471 --> 01:27:08.071]  It's HD.
[01:27:08.371 --> 01:27:08.992]  It takes a while.
[01:27:09.292 --> 01:27:10.613]  To Band.Video.
[01:27:10.733 --> 01:27:13.416]  And I just, it's so critical to get this out.
[01:27:14.284 --> 01:27:18.326]  And I'll probably do another video just on how they're trying to set the police up and claim they were involved.
[01:27:19.046 --> 01:27:21.788]  No, no, it's the police on top that were involved that ordered the stand down.
[01:27:22.048 --> 01:27:27.631]  Now they want to scare the Capitol Police and I guess kill a few others or make them commit suicide so this doesn't come out.
[01:27:27.671 --> 01:27:36.415]  But we are going to expose the Capitol Police did a great job and they were under a PSYOP, physical globalist attack, and were very sad for the officer that had a heart attack and died.
[01:27:36.435 --> 01:27:37.416]  And we were not with the leftist.
[01:27:38.016 --> 01:27:42.840]  The number one question I get on the street is, Alex, I love your show, but are you for real?
[01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:45.382]  Do you really mean the things you say?
[01:28:08.643 --> 01:28:14.848]  Well, I mean, anybody that's followed the show and written down what I said is going to happen knows that almost all of it's now unfolded.
[01:28:16.089 --> 01:28:17.129]  So it's very, very frustrating.
[01:28:17.670 --> 01:28:21.012]  You don't need to sit there and put your faith in me.
[01:28:22.253 --> 01:28:24.995]  Or your faith in the Dalai Lama.
[01:28:25.556 --> 01:28:27.297]  Or your faith in the private Federal Reserve.
[01:28:27.737 --> 01:28:29.719]  Or your faith in some televangelist on TV.
[01:28:31.172 --> 01:28:35.155]  You just have to have a memory and write down and remember the things I've laid out.
[01:28:35.815 --> 01:28:41.499]  You can go research those things for yourself, and you can find out, is this guy more often than not right?
[01:28:41.519 --> 01:28:43.561]  You'll find out about 95% of the time I'm right.
[01:28:44.261 --> 01:28:47.363]  There's nothing more I'd like than to be wrong, but here's the deal.
[01:28:48.864 --> 01:28:57.330]  I am so angry at the Q people, not because they were awake to the new world order, not because they were exposing child kidnapping rings, that's all great, but because
[01:28:58.669 --> 01:29:00.733]  They had this feeling of invincibility.
[01:29:01.714 --> 01:29:04.099]  And this feeling of everything's gonna be handled, everything's taken care of.
[01:29:05.181 --> 01:29:11.331]  And this attitude that they didn't have to document anything, because they were just going off some 8-chan board.
[01:29:12.259 --> 01:29:15.441]  I can show you DW.EU.
[01:29:15.561 --> 01:29:18.002]  I can show you the London Guardian.
[01:29:18.583 --> 01:29:23.545]  I can show you thousands of children a month kidnapped, tortured, some killed.
[01:29:24.066 --> 01:29:28.728]  I can show you the Catholic Church with nuns delivering little boys to be gang raped by men.
[01:29:29.068 --> 01:29:29.949]  That's just this week.
[01:29:30.729 --> 01:29:38.113]  My God, there's so many articles and trials and convictions just on that subject that I can't even look at it all.
[01:29:38.133 --> 01:29:38.634]  I don't want to.
[01:29:38.654 --> 01:29:39.214]  I'm sick of it.
[01:29:40.379 --> 01:29:43.982]  Even though it's my job to expose it, it's a horror to focus on it.
[01:29:44.663 --> 01:29:46.104]  So people say, Jones, are you for real?
[01:29:47.105 --> 01:29:48.486]  I mean, I'm as real as a heart attack.
[01:29:49.026 --> 01:29:50.347]  I'm as real as getting hit by a bus.
[01:29:51.028 --> 01:29:52.049]  I'm as real as a train wreck.
[01:29:53.089 --> 01:29:55.091]  Because I'm covering what's really happening in the world.
[01:29:55.451 --> 01:29:57.313]  Everybody else just sells out to the system.
[01:29:58.334 --> 01:29:59.315]  They go on to get along.
[01:29:59.855 --> 01:30:02.677]  But it's been my job to tell the truth, as best I can.
[01:30:02.697 --> 01:30:03.158]  I'm not perfect.
[01:30:04.096 --> 01:30:17.442]  So if you want to keep us on the air, and you've noticed we've got an incredible track record of being accurate, and you want to keep us in the game for all the crazy things that are about to go down, then go to InfoWarsStore.com and fund us, because you are our sponsor.
[01:30:18.183 --> 01:30:21.584]  When you think about InfoWars, you think about Alex Jones as being InfoWars.
[01:30:21.604 --> 01:30:23.065]  You think about my crew as being InfoWars.
[01:30:24.534 --> 01:30:27.777]  That's like at 35,000 feet, one little speck down below.
[01:30:28.337 --> 01:30:35.743]  I'm just a focal point of your will for freedom and your thirst for justice and your thirst to have a better life and your own destiny.
[01:30:36.383 --> 01:30:42.288]  So when you support us, you've got a commitment from me that I'm going to support you and not sell out or back down.
[01:30:42.729 --> 01:30:43.269]  That's a fact.
[01:30:43.869 --> 01:30:48.753]  And so InfoWars is such a brain trust, we've come so far together, and I know our best workers to come.
[01:30:50.649 --> 01:30:51.810]  I am literally in your hands.
[01:30:52.630 --> 01:31:00.314]  And without your financial support, without your prayer, without your word of mouth, the Transfecta InfoWars is done.
[01:31:01.194 --> 01:31:07.638]  I'll have to phase it out in the next six months and have a skeleton crew and try to keep a defense up against the Globos, but it'll be a shadow of its former self.
[01:31:08.468 --> 01:31:10.490]  And that's not some victimology there.
[01:31:10.510 --> 01:31:11.731]  Everybody else has already been shut down.
[01:31:12.111 --> 01:31:12.952]  That's the reality.
[01:31:12.972 --> 01:31:14.353]  So I'm going to explain this again.
[01:31:14.893 --> 01:31:16.254]  You invested in Infowars.
[01:31:16.695 --> 01:31:17.896]  You built Infowars.
[01:31:18.596 --> 01:31:21.739]  And it hit the motherlode of justice and truth and freedom.
[01:31:22.079 --> 01:31:23.420]  So now it's under attack.
[01:31:24.041 --> 01:31:29.465]  So now that it's proven, now that it's bonafide, now that it's the real McCoy and you know that,
[01:31:30.546 --> 01:31:33.547]  You don't have to ask whether I'm for real or not because you can see the proof right there.
[01:31:33.787 --> 01:31:34.787]  You're for real, I'm for real.
[01:31:35.407 --> 01:31:36.868]  Go to InfoWorksStore.com today.
[01:31:36.948 --> 01:31:39.248]  Get things like Ultra 12 to boost your immune system.
[01:31:39.769 --> 01:31:42.249]  Get things like our Charcoal Accent Toothpaste that's amazing.
[01:31:42.629 --> 01:31:43.210]  It's all there.
[01:31:43.710 --> 01:31:48.511]  And share it with your friends and family and tell them to tune in because that's how we circumvent the censors.
[01:31:49.011 --> 01:31:52.092]  That's how we override George Soros and Bill Gates and the rest of them.
[01:31:52.112 --> 01:31:53.372]  I'm in your hands, you're in my hands.
[01:31:53.633 --> 01:31:54.893]  Let's take action and win together.
