[00:00:07.845 --> 00:00:16.029]  The image of this airplane's engine burning in flight is quite the allegory for this very moment in time for the United States of America.
[00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:24.114]  After his first month as president, Joe Biden has canceled the Keystone Pipeline, terminating thousands of jobs and raising fuel prices.
[00:00:24.814 --> 00:00:30.896]  Suspended protection of our bulk power grid, which has already been infiltrated by the CCP.
[00:00:30.896 --> 00:00:39.000]  Nodded presidential support for the CCP's strong arming of Hong Kong, Chinese death camps, and the Uyghur genocide.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.861]  Rejoined the Paris Climate Accord to further destroy U.S.
[00:00:42.861 --> 00:00:46.783]  industry while China's industry burns at full throttle.
[00:00:46.783 --> 00:00:51.785]  And rejoined the CCP-run World Health Organization, pushing the COVID-19 hoax.
[00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.913]  The federal government has completely fallen to the CCP.
[00:00:56.913 --> 00:00:59.636]  America has lost one of its engines.
[00:00:59.636 --> 00:01:06.945]  It is now up to our one remaining engine, the states, to pull us up before we crash, or at the very least, give us a good landing.
[00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:26.707]  Section 4 of the 25th Amendment empowers the Vice President and a majority of the President's Cabinet to determine that the President is no longer fit to serve as President.
[00:01:26.707 --> 00:01:29.189]  It was attempted on President Trump in 2017.
[00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:38.516]  The discussion of the 25th Amendment was simply, Rod raised the issue and discussed it with me in the context of
[00:01:39.396 --> 00:01:45.178]  Thinking about how many other cabinet officials might support such an effort.
[00:01:45.178 --> 00:01:56.281]  Well I've been speaking out about the invocation of the 25th amendment since early this year because I do think the president is not equipped to do the job.
[00:01:56.281 --> 00:01:58.602]  And recently after the Capitol riot.
[00:01:58.602 --> 00:02:01.683]  And I don't know where his cabinet has been all this time but
[00:02:02.183 --> 00:02:08.991]  It's long overdue for the 25th Amendment because this man is no longer capable of serving the United States of America.
[00:02:08.991 --> 00:02:12.595]  Of course, Trump's mental fitness wasn't the real issue.
[00:02:12.595 --> 00:02:19.082]  It was his pro-America rhetoric that drove the Democrats to abuse Section 4 of the 25th Amendment.
[00:02:19.082 --> 00:02:21.424]  President Donald Trump, who tweeted, quote,
[00:02:22.265 --> 00:02:25.606]  Crazy Nancy is the one who should be under observation.
[00:02:25.606 --> 00:02:27.607]  They don't call her crazy for nothing.
[00:02:27.607 --> 00:02:35.669]  But when it comes to mental fitness, Biden has just one month proven he is out to lunch and a prime candidate.
[00:02:35.669 --> 00:02:40.691]  We expect these additional 200 million doses to be delivered this summer.
[00:02:40.691 --> 00:02:48.853]  And some of it will come as early, begin to come in early summer, but by the mid, by the midsummer that this vaccine will be there.
[00:02:49.870 --> 00:03:01.878]  And the order and that increases the total vaccine order in the United States by 50% from 400 million order to 600 million.
[00:03:01.878 --> 00:03:05.080]  This is enough vaccine to fully vaccinate 300 Americans.
[00:03:06.835 --> 00:03:10.238]  By end of the summer, the beginning of the fall.
[00:03:10.238 --> 00:03:18.226]  It's clear to me at the least that US President Joe Biden is struggling with dementia and is clearly not up to the task he's been sworn in to do.
[00:03:18.226 --> 00:03:31.839]  It was quite telling that while President Biden was playing Mario Kart and napping all of last weekend, apparently he had no official duties, his ambitious deputy Kamala Harris was telephoning foreign leaders.
[00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:38.444]  Biden started off by excusing the genocide against the Uyghur people by the Chinese Communist Party.
[00:03:38.444 --> 00:03:42.127]  He dismissed it as just Chinese cultural norms.
[00:03:42.127 --> 00:03:48.793]  The central principle of Xi Jinping is that there must be a united, tightly controlled China.
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.621]  And he uses his rationale for the things he does based on that.
[00:03:53.621 --> 00:04:00.682]  I point out to him, no American president can be sustained as a president if he doesn't reflect the values of the United States.
[00:04:00.682 --> 00:04:17.106]  And so the idea, I'm not going to speak out against what he's doing in Hong Kong, what he's doing with the Uyghurs in western mountains of China, and Taiwan trying to end the one China policy by making it forceful.
[00:04:17.106 --> 00:04:18.806]  I said, and by the way, he said he
[00:04:19.486 --> 00:04:20.748]  He gets it.
[00:04:20.748 --> 00:04:27.118]  Culturally, there are different norms at each country, and their leaders are expected to follow.
[00:04:27.118 --> 00:04:35.210]  But then he went on to suggest that blacks, Hispanics, and people who live in the country aren't really smart enough to get online.
[00:04:36.428 --> 00:04:38.230]  A lot of people don't know how to register.
[00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:49.079]  Not everybody in the community, in the Hispanic and the African American community, particularly in rural areas that are distant and or inner city.
[00:04:49.079 --> 00:04:50.801]  That's just part of the report.
[00:04:50.801 --> 00:04:54.564]  See the same entire report at BAN.VIDEO and share it.
[00:04:54.564 --> 00:04:55.645]  It's titled 21st Amendment.
[00:04:55.645 --> 00:04:59.309]  It's inevitable for Biden.
[00:04:59.309 --> 00:05:02.071]  I sell supplements for two reasons.
[00:05:02.071 --> 00:05:02.812]  Because they work.
[00:05:03.433 --> 00:05:07.575]  They're real, they're powerful, and because it's a giant market.
[00:05:07.575 --> 00:05:10.056]  But again, why is there a giant market?
[00:05:10.056 --> 00:05:11.677]  Because it works.
[00:05:11.677 --> 00:05:13.658]  That's why it exponentially grows.
[00:05:13.658 --> 00:05:30.147]  So whether it's Saw Palmetto and other key ingredients in our Prostate Formula, Prostagard, or whether it is the super high grade Organic Vitamin B12 in Ultra 12, or whether it's the PQQ or the CoQ10 in DNA Force,
[00:05:31.104 --> 00:05:34.165]  Or the pure Deep Earth Crystal Iodine X2.
[00:05:34.165 --> 00:05:42.307]  These are all the very best supplements you're going to find in an already great market of high quality products out there.
[00:05:42.307 --> 00:05:44.007]  And it funds the InfoWars.
[00:05:44.007 --> 00:05:48.408]  So even if these products weren't high quality, which they are, you're funding the InfoWars so you can't lose.
[00:05:48.408 --> 00:05:50.689]  InfoWars delivers in spades.
[00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:53.830]  Please visit InfoWarsStore.com and get the products today.
[00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.611]  Again, I want to thank you all for keeping us on air at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:06:02.611 --> 00:06:04.312]  Big Brother.
[00:06:04.312 --> 00:06:06.634]  Mainstream media.
[00:06:06.634 --> 00:06:08.416]  Government cover-ups.
[00:06:08.416 --> 00:06:10.497]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:06:10.497 --> 00:06:12.639]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:20.105]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:20.105 --> 00:06:29.493]  We are witnessing the scientific, premeditated, corporate, global government-directed dismantlement of the United States of America as we know it.
[00:06:30.191 --> 00:06:33.594]  Because a private corporate tyranny is being set up.
[00:06:33.594 --> 00:06:39.900]  They don't want uppity Americans that have due process, that have a right to self-defense, a right to private property, a right to travel.
[00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.942]  They don't like having a big middle class to deal with.
[00:06:42.942 --> 00:06:44.504]  They don't care what color you are.
[00:06:44.504 --> 00:06:47.746]  They want you poor and under their control.
[00:06:47.746 --> 00:06:50.088]  So, I have really prepared a lot.
[00:06:50.088 --> 00:06:52.711]  I always prepare for the broadcast, but I've really prepared a lot today.
[00:06:52.711 --> 00:06:56.114]  So I'm going to do my little best going over
[00:06:57.512 --> 00:06:59.173]  Well, we're going to be breaking down today.
[00:06:59.173 --> 00:07:07.276]  We have the new Attorney General, now confirmed, who swears to declare war on all Trump voters, all 80 million of them.
[00:07:07.276 --> 00:07:16.639]  And he has General Ida Ray that carried out the gun confiscation in Katrina, famously, saying that all Trump supporters are white supremacists and terrorists.
[00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:19.701]  These people are just completely insane and out of control.
[00:07:19.701 --> 00:07:25.483]  We're going to be laying all of that out for you today, Sunday live.
[00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.761]  The Attorney General pledges to persecute all populist Americans.
[00:07:30.761 --> 00:07:35.863]  One month of Biden and America is already collapsing.
[00:07:35.863 --> 00:07:47.406]  He carried out the gun confiscation in Katrina of people in their homes, high and dry, and he is prepared to move against the public now.
[00:07:47.406 --> 00:07:49.267]  So that is all coming up.
[00:07:49.267 --> 00:07:53.768]  Here is General Idea Ray, and we'll also be getting to the new Attorney General.
[00:07:55.285 --> 00:07:59.287]  Biden, the Democrats, still running scared after stealing election.
[00:07:59.287 --> 00:08:01.708]  Will never hold an open event with the American people.
[00:08:01.708 --> 00:08:05.150]  It is so incredibly obvious.
[00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:07.331]  Ignored by media, dirtbag Joe Biden says U.S.
[00:08:07.331 --> 00:08:11.292]  veterans and former police officers are fueling white supremacy in America.
[00:08:11.292 --> 00:08:13.654]  School children are being taught nationwide.
[00:08:13.654 --> 00:08:18.436]  We have PSAs that whiteness is evil that must be rejected and rebuked.
[00:08:18.436 --> 00:08:21.117]  I mean, this is just beyond KKK stuff on the left.
[00:08:22.569 --> 00:08:28.092]  Meanwhile, the Justice Department and FBI are investigating whether Roger Stone and Alex Jones play a role in the Capitol siege.
[00:08:28.092 --> 00:08:31.154]  That's the Washington Post.
[00:08:31.154 --> 00:08:31.334]  U.S.
[00:08:31.334 --> 00:08:34.136]  investigating Alex Jones and Roger Stone.
[00:08:34.136 --> 00:08:36.437]  I mean, you mean the Chai Com run FBI.
[00:08:36.437 --> 00:08:39.919]  Investigating Alex Jones and Roger Stone for links to Capitol rioters.
[00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:41.660]  Oh my goodness.
[00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:44.362]  Once upon a presidency, populist to dissident.
[00:08:46.025 --> 00:08:50.510]  That ties in to meet the new President of the United States, Barack Obama, now in his third term.
[00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:56.136]  That is the first stack that I'm going to cover in detail next segment.
[00:08:56.136 --> 00:08:58.158]  That's just one of the stacks.
[00:08:59.659 --> 00:09:02.361]  Let's look at the next stack I'm going to cover in the segment after that.
[00:09:02.361 --> 00:09:03.322]  Smoking Gun!
[00:09:03.322 --> 00:09:08.346]  Joe Biden's Department of Energy blocked Texas from increasing power ahead of Killer Storm.
[00:09:08.346 --> 00:09:14.030]  We have the Department of Energy document, and of course we'll show how under Obama they shut down over 100 power plants.
[00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:18.514]  Trump had to turn them back on, but the owners said, we don't trust the fact that you'll be still in office.
[00:09:18.514 --> 00:09:19.755]  They're going to remove you.
[00:09:19.755 --> 00:09:21.916]  So they never reopened any of the coal power plants.
[00:09:21.916 --> 00:09:23.998]  Natural gas doesn't work in the cold.
[00:09:23.998 --> 00:09:27.761]  We had natural gas generator because it's all you can basically buy these days.
[00:09:27.761 --> 00:09:28.802]  It failed here as well.
[00:09:29.989 --> 00:09:36.595]  So when Bill Gates goes, oh, it's natural gas that failed, yeah, because you took the coal power plants out.
[00:09:36.595 --> 00:09:38.296]  That is all coming up.
[00:09:38.296 --> 00:09:44.961]  And the 18,000% power increases for many people, folks with $500 bills got $17,000 bills.
[00:09:44.961 --> 00:09:51.427]  Now remember I told you, once the rolling back blackouts begin, they'll always use cold weather or really hot weather as an excuse.
[00:09:52.734 --> 00:10:00.177]  They'll then down their regular systems and then make you buy it from other grids that they own and control and make billions an hour sometimes.
[00:10:00.177 --> 00:10:04.279]  And that's what happened to major fleecing of Texas.
[00:10:04.279 --> 00:10:15.323]  I will give you the complete breakdown of that in a huge special report on Friday with the exclusive document protested at the governor's mansion yesterday because he's got
[00:10:16.368 --> 00:10:23.939]  Joe Biden coming sometime next week to grandstand and give us our own tax money back and tell us how it's Texas's fault that the power went out when it wasn't.
[00:10:23.939 --> 00:10:26.282]  And I've been warning.
[00:10:26.282 --> 00:10:28.305]  This is coming ad nauseum.
[00:10:28.305 --> 00:10:31.450]  Then after we cover that incredibly important area.
[00:10:32.498 --> 00:10:33.338]  We have.
[00:10:33.338 --> 00:10:34.159]  It's madness.
[00:10:34.159 --> 00:10:37.440]  And I've actually read the new, or scanned over the new legislation.
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:40.101]  Former Trump advisor Stephen Miller goes off.
[00:10:40.101 --> 00:10:47.603]  Democrats propose sending invites to criminal legal aliens, rapists, murderers, you name it, to come back and get citizenship.
[00:10:47.603 --> 00:10:52.905]  But outside of that, by fiat, they've already opened the borders up completely.
[00:10:52.905 --> 00:10:58.107]  Doesn't matter how unpopular it is because Joe Biden stole the election.
[00:10:58.107 --> 00:10:59.727]  That is all coming up.
[00:10:59.727 --> 00:11:01.148]  AT&T trying to merge with
[00:11:01.932 --> 00:11:09.096]  The whole Huawei and the Communist Chinese, that's another incredibly important stack.
[00:11:09.096 --> 00:11:10.617]  Also, all from L.A.
[00:11:10.617 --> 00:11:18.462]  to Baltimore, Maryland, from California to Maryland, all over the country, New York to Dallas, Texas is proposing it.
[00:11:18.462 --> 00:11:21.184]  They say, pay criminals not to rob and kill.
[00:11:21.184 --> 00:11:22.304]  It's a new novel idea.
[00:11:22.304 --> 00:11:24.025]  Pay people not to murder.
[00:11:24.025 --> 00:11:28.468]  Baltimore urges city Baltimore activists to pay criminals not to murder.
[00:11:28.468 --> 00:11:29.869]  You know, that's called paying a pirate.
[00:11:30.652 --> 00:11:32.554]  Paying someone for a ransom?
[00:11:32.554 --> 00:11:42.482]  It's been done before, and as Rudiger Kipling said, once you pay the pirate once, you'll pay him twice, you'll pay him three times, until he finally kidnaps you and sells you for a ransom as well.
[00:11:42.482 --> 00:11:44.764]  That's how third world countries collapse.
[00:11:44.764 --> 00:11:48.146]  And we're following an exact trail of collapse.
[00:11:48.146 --> 00:11:53.431]  And the country's being sucked dry while we all burst through the signal and wear our mask.
[00:11:53.431 --> 00:11:56.313]  And now Biden says it's permanent, never take them off.
[00:11:56.313 --> 00:11:58.415]  Doesn't matter if you take the vaccine, that doesn't protect you.
[00:11:59.228 --> 00:12:05.753]  Oh, but there's herd immunity, suddenly the death toll is way down because the winter is going to end and there won't be people dying of flu and all the rest of it.
[00:12:05.753 --> 00:12:10.696]  It's a giant fraud, but we still comply so the tyranny gets worse.
[00:12:10.696 --> 00:12:13.898]  And then the big whopper.
[00:12:13.898 --> 00:12:16.720]  I'm going to cover this last segment of the first hour.
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:24.625]  When I read the headline, I thought, okay, I trust Christian Anahan at Information Liberation does a great job.
[00:12:24.625 --> 00:12:26.446]  And I said, let me go read the New York Times article.
[00:12:26.446 --> 00:12:27.047]  It was true.
[00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:34.758]  Within two paragraphs it says, critical thinking is the enemy and must be suspended in your mind.
[00:12:34.758 --> 00:12:39.003]  Directly called Crime Stop or Double Think from 1984.
[00:12:39.003 --> 00:12:44.430]  And a guy that stalked me here in Austin for a long time, Charlie Wurzel, the weasel,
[00:12:46.147 --> 00:12:56.729]  He's in the article talking to professors about how we must only believe them, and only follow them, and disregard everything else, and report anyone that doesn't agree with the New York Times.
[00:12:56.729 --> 00:13:05.191]  I mean, that's what cults do when they get wobbly is, don't talk to your family, don't read anything else, don't have any friends, only the cult.
[00:13:05.191 --> 00:13:09.932]  New York Times, critical thinking isn't helping in the fight against misinformation.
[00:13:09.932 --> 00:13:10.252]  No!
[00:13:11.221 --> 00:13:12.442]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:13:12.442 --> 00:13:17.204]  It's like Snopes came out and Bill Gates came out last week and said, Alex Jones is a liar.
[00:13:17.204 --> 00:13:21.186]  They named me, actually, and said, India did not ban the Pfizer shot.
[00:13:21.186 --> 00:13:22.587]  He's a liar.
[00:13:22.587 --> 00:13:25.568]  Anyone can type it, go to the Indian websites, all in English.
[00:13:25.568 --> 00:13:34.093]  It's a billion, 300 million people, super scientific in their science sectors, and they banned it.
[00:13:34.093 --> 00:13:34.533]  They banned it.
[00:13:35.106 --> 00:13:37.247]  They said, no, you haven't done the studies.
[00:13:37.247 --> 00:13:40.790]  We got evidence of people being brain damaged and being paralyzed.
[00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:50.496]  And then they had all these publications come out, Newsweek, you name it, and say, I was a liar that India approved the vaccine.
[00:13:50.496 --> 00:13:52.037]  Well, I'm going to show you.
[00:13:52.037 --> 00:13:58.080]  Anybody can type in India stops emergency approval of Pfizer mRNA vaccine.
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.201]  You'll get hundreds of articles.
[00:13:59.201 --> 00:13:59.861]  They don't care.
[00:13:59.861 --> 00:14:01.062]  They go, oh, don't believe them.
[00:14:01.062 --> 00:14:02.423]  No.
[00:14:02.423 --> 00:14:03.283]  And Hank Aaron.
[00:14:03.283 --> 00:14:03.924]  Remember Hank Aaron?
[00:14:05.327 --> 00:14:07.468]  The famous baseball player, probably the best ever.
[00:14:07.468 --> 00:14:15.771]  They said he died of natural causes, not the second round of COVID, and they had an autopsy.
[00:14:15.771 --> 00:14:16.712]  Robert Kennedy Jr.
[00:14:16.712 --> 00:14:17.732]  went and talked to him.
[00:14:17.732 --> 00:14:20.333]  They gave him statements and said, we never saw his body.
[00:14:20.333 --> 00:14:22.994]  He died after the second shot.
[00:14:22.994 --> 00:14:26.856]  They told us natural causes, so we bought it because of what we're told to do.
[00:14:26.856 --> 00:14:28.557]  Oh, and Pfizer withdraws application.
[00:14:28.557 --> 00:14:29.337]  Put that back up, please.
[00:14:30.785 --> 00:14:32.966]  For use of its COVID-19 vaccine in India.
[00:14:32.966 --> 00:14:34.567]  CNBC!
[00:14:34.567 --> 00:14:36.888]  In fact, print that for me.
[00:14:36.888 --> 00:14:41.851]  But I'm going to show you all these publications.
[00:14:41.851 --> 00:14:45.353]  I mean, it was in AP, it was in Reuters, it was in Newsweek.
[00:14:45.353 --> 00:14:46.854]  Jones made it up again.
[00:14:46.854 --> 00:14:46.914]  Wow!
[00:14:50.825 --> 00:14:58.632]  And imagine me and Charlie Wurzel get 30 pieces of silver to sit there and lie to people, and then write articles about, don't read anything from the New York Times.
[00:14:58.632 --> 00:15:01.235]  You think it's like satire, like this is a satire article.
[00:15:01.235 --> 00:15:02.696]  There's nothing satirical about it.
[00:15:02.696 --> 00:15:07.981]  These people are cult members and cult leaders, and they think we're under their control.
[00:15:07.981 --> 00:15:08.721]  We're not.
[00:15:08.721 --> 00:15:11.384]  Meanwhile, I'm about cults, Cartoon Network, PSA.
[00:15:11.384 --> 00:15:12.445]  We'll show you the video that's coming up.
[00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:16.453]  Tells children to seek color to become anti-racist.
[00:15:16.453 --> 00:15:17.274]  That's a quote.
[00:15:17.274 --> 00:15:19.715]  Preaches colorblindness is bad.
[00:15:19.715 --> 00:15:24.619]  So what Martin Luther King said, Oh, don't choose a football player because he plays good.
[00:15:24.619 --> 00:15:26.281]  Don't go to a restaurant because it tastes good.
[00:15:26.281 --> 00:15:28.102]  Don't buy a suit because they do a good job.
[00:15:28.102 --> 00:15:29.784]  That's what I do.
[00:15:29.784 --> 00:15:30.144]  Don't.
[00:15:30.144 --> 00:15:30.844]  No, no, no.
[00:15:30.844 --> 00:15:32.226]  It's the color of their skin.
[00:15:32.226 --> 00:15:33.927]  I mean, this is just evil, folks.
[00:15:34.611 --> 00:15:42.193]  But again, I was downtown protesting this weekend, and I would say to the leftists in the leftist downtown area, I'd say, India banned Pfizer!
[00:15:42.193 --> 00:15:43.793]  Watch out!
[00:15:43.793 --> 00:15:45.294]  Biden just endorsed death camps!
[00:15:45.294 --> 00:15:46.594]  They go good!
[00:15:46.594 --> 00:15:47.815]  I love death camps!
[00:15:47.815 --> 00:15:48.755]  F you!
[00:15:48.755 --> 00:15:51.395]  I mean, these people are fascist scum!
[00:15:51.395 --> 00:15:52.116]  We'll be right back.
[00:15:52.116 --> 00:15:53.236]  Ladies and gentlemen, stay with us.
[00:15:57.936 --> 00:16:06.103]  Agenda 21 and Agenda 2030 are all about making you dependent and cutting you off from energy, food, and medicine.
[00:16:06.103 --> 00:16:14.751]  And with the blackouts we've seen that are guaranteed to be engineered to bring in federal and globalist control, we have seen massive lines of people
[00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:23.768]  Lined up at the few grocery stores and restaurants that were open and most of them getting turned away after hours of freezing in the cold.
[00:16:23.768 --> 00:16:29.573]  We've seen millions of people sleeping in their cars because they don't have any power in their house and then running out of gas.
[00:16:29.573 --> 00:16:31.515]  Ladies and gentlemen, energy is king.
[00:16:31.955 --> 00:16:35.356]  And food is the energy our bodies run off of, and water as well.

[00:17:58.582 --> 00:18:00.604]  You cannot hide a grand assault.
[00:18:02.083 --> 00:18:09.145]  America is about to have its energy cut off, its borders destroyed, its dollar brought down to nothing.
[00:18:09.145 --> 00:18:14.127]  All of you that have served Satan believe that you are the right team.
[00:18:14.127 --> 00:18:17.088]  You're about to find out how pathetic you are.
[00:18:17.088 --> 00:18:24.331]  So I ask all of you who are awake and who love God, stop living in fear.
[00:18:24.331 --> 00:18:27.171]  The enemy is about to expose itself.
[00:18:27.171 --> 00:18:28.472]  The enemy can't help itself.
[00:18:29.474 --> 00:18:33.535]  The enemy comes to kill, steal, and destroy.
[00:18:33.535 --> 00:18:37.556]  We sit here, as good people, and get upset about that, and try to stop it.
[00:18:37.556 --> 00:18:48.978]  We should, but once it comes through, once it hits us, once it's dominating us, and raping us, and attacking us, we just have to point out we tried to stop it.
[00:18:48.978 --> 00:18:51.139]  So prepare yourselves, America.
[00:18:51.139 --> 00:18:54.739]  You're going under judgement, just like all the children that were aborted.
[00:18:54.739 --> 00:18:56.420]  This is the truth.
[00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:57.780]  This is the Infowar.
[00:18:59.551 --> 00:19:14.276]  The entire New World Order system is about making you feel pathetic, making you feel weak, making you play the part of a victim so you don't take your birthright as being made the image of God and the incredible mission and destiny we have being given free will.
[00:19:14.916 --> 00:19:23.098]  Being given free will, being given consciousness, is literally the seed of an entire universe, an entire system.
[00:19:23.098 --> 00:19:39.743]  And the fact that you're able to commune with God, the fact that you're able to see the beauty of the sunset, or the beauty of the waves in the ocean, or the beauty of your wife or your husband, or the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty of music, the fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic.
[00:19:39.743 --> 00:19:43.184]  And that itself is what God teaches us is worship.
[00:19:43.804 --> 00:19:52.174]  So don't worship the globalists, don't worship the NFL, don't worship all the things of the system, but worship the things of God, because we're made by God.
[00:19:52.174 --> 00:20:01.465]  And appreciate your consciousness, and appreciate free speech, while you still have it, while you still have it.
[00:20:01.465 --> 00:20:04.068]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:15.165 --> 00:20:17.366]  Today, February 21st, the year is 2021.
[00:20:17.366 --> 00:20:24.749]  The websites are Infowars.com, Newswars.com, and Band.video.
[00:20:24.749 --> 00:20:34.913]  And the globalists hope around the clock that you don't research what they're really up to, that you just sit there like a victim and take it.
[00:20:34.913 --> 00:20:39.314]  Next segment, I'm going to look at the power shutdowns in Texas and the smoking gun.
[00:20:39.314 --> 00:20:40.995]  I'm going to show you the Department of Energy document.
[00:20:42.134 --> 00:20:46.998]  The state of Texas, four or five days before, was begging them to let them turn up the power.
[00:20:46.998 --> 00:20:51.181]  But there's fines and criminal penalties if they do without authorization.
[00:20:51.181 --> 00:20:56.325]  And they waited until it crashed on Valentine's Day to then let them do it.
[00:20:56.325 --> 00:20:58.567]  Oh, let me wait till you're going under the freezing water.
[00:20:58.567 --> 00:21:04.292]  Let me wait till you're dying to then give you a life vest so I can stay in front of everybody that I've tried to help you.
[00:21:04.292 --> 00:21:05.713]  Very, very sick.
[00:21:05.713 --> 00:21:08.135]  We've got Joe Biden coming to town.
[00:21:08.135 --> 00:21:08.455]  In fact,
[00:21:09.305 --> 00:21:16.910]  Here's Joe Biden babbling about how he's coming to Austin, like Santa Claus, to give us all this free money, and to give us a hand.
[00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:21.132]  Here it is.
[00:21:21.132 --> 00:21:28.276]  And so we're going to sign that declaration once it's in front of me, and God willing, it will bring a lot of relief to a lot of Texans.
[00:21:28.276 --> 00:21:30.677]  He said he may visit Texas next week.
[00:21:30.677 --> 00:21:31.298]  If in fact,
[00:21:32.057 --> 00:21:37.740]  It's concluded that I can do it without creating a burden for the folks on the ground while they're dealing with this crisis.
[00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:40.161]  I plan on going.
[00:21:40.161 --> 00:21:41.741]  What a nice person!
[00:21:41.741 --> 00:21:52.626]  You know, I had an old Labrador retriever, lived to be about 14, and he's got that same look right before the dog died, like kind of scared and hesitant and trying to talk but can barely do it.
[00:21:52.626 --> 00:22:01.510]  I mean, his dementia is just accelerating so horribly, and that's why they put him in there as a weak signal to the world to end the dollar, to move all our jobs to China, and try to
[00:22:02.995 --> 00:22:03.636]  It's all on record.
[00:22:03.636 --> 00:22:09.321]  The Council on Foreign Relations brags that Biden is a complete joke and that it's the end of the country.
[00:22:09.321 --> 00:22:12.784]  And I was in downtown Austin trying to warn them this weekend with a bullhorn.
[00:22:12.784 --> 00:22:18.869]  I was down at the governor's mansion and about 40% of people said, I want to kill you.
[00:22:18.869 --> 00:22:22.552]  Another 20% kind of looked at me, but they were flipping me off.
[00:22:22.552 --> 00:22:24.874]  And maybe 30% were listening and waving.
[00:22:24.874 --> 00:22:27.116]  But I mean, it's just sick.
[00:22:28.903 --> 00:22:31.864]  A hard-working area like Pittsburgh, everybody would be saying, yay, Alex!
[00:22:31.864 --> 00:22:34.085]  Where I was in San Antonio, they'd be saying, yay, Alex!
[00:22:34.085 --> 00:22:39.366]  But the liberal trendies are just absolutely out of their minds.
[00:22:39.366 --> 00:22:42.707]  There's no helping it, but they're going to find out real soon.
[00:22:42.707 --> 00:22:43.828]  So let's talk about this.
[00:22:43.828 --> 00:22:48.469]  Biden AG pick Merrick Garland vows to prosecute capital writers.
[00:22:48.469 --> 00:22:50.530]  Zero Hedge article.
[00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:51.450]  He said it confirmed.
[00:22:52.213 --> 00:22:56.977]  I will supervise the prosecution of white supremacists and others who stormed the Capitol on January 6th.
[00:22:56.977 --> 00:23:01.260]  A heinous attack that sought to disrupt a cornerstone of our democracy.
[00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:04.963]  The peaceful transfer of power to a newly elected government.
[00:23:04.963 --> 00:23:05.684]  And that's the thing.
[00:23:05.684 --> 00:23:09.186]  Everybody that protested them, they claimed attacked the Capitol.
[00:23:09.186 --> 00:23:10.908]  It was like 200 out of a million.
[00:23:10.908 --> 00:23:13.570]  And then it turns out most of them are anti-fun, other provocateurs.
[00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:15.912]  And that's the big news I should be announcing.
[00:23:15.912 --> 00:23:18.554]  I've been up here basically all day working on this.
[00:23:18.554 --> 00:23:21.276]  And right now they're putting all the documents, all the videos, all the clips in.
[00:23:22.498 --> 00:23:48.370]  At the bottom of the hour, next hour, I'm going to premiere a report that will take two segments to play that is incredible and proves, it has Democrats, Antifa, people that have been arrested, people caught working for CNN, saying that they staged the Capitol attack and all the witnesses in the video, it's all come together, it's all come out in the last week, it's insane.
[00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:51.191]  And that's why they've got this horrible evil general
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:24:00.464]  Who came out, General Idarae, who ran the gun confiscation in Katrina.
[00:24:00.464 --> 00:24:09.370]  Remember how they went into the houses and went into high and dry areas and went into people all over the state and would come in and break into their safes and take their guns?
[00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:12.752]  Because General Idarae said, we're confiscating your guns.
[00:24:12.752 --> 00:24:20.156]  And this has been used as a training drill across the country now for future gun confiscation.
[00:24:20.156 --> 00:24:21.597]  General Honorary.
[00:24:21.597 --> 00:24:22.578]  I'm not going off of
[00:24:23.203 --> 00:24:25.424]  Teleprompter General Honoré.
[00:24:25.424 --> 00:24:33.366]  So General Honoré, who evacuated the Superdome 50 years ago, talks about Katrina.
[00:24:33.366 --> 00:24:35.907]  And he tells us what a big savior he is.
[00:24:35.907 --> 00:24:41.809]  But in reality, this is their giant power grab, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:41.809 --> 00:24:44.590]  And that takes us to this next article.
[00:24:45.413 --> 00:24:46.674]  From MSN.
[00:24:46.674 --> 00:24:54.699]  And whether it's the New York Times, the Washington Post, the LA Times, the Detroit Free Press, the Austin American States, from the Houston Chronicle, every paper in the country ran this today.
[00:24:54.699 --> 00:24:59.261]  Feds probing Roger Stone, Alex Jones over roles in the Capitol.
[00:24:59.261 --> 00:25:05.565]  And the articles go on from there about how they want to arrest us, they want to get us.
[00:25:05.565 --> 00:25:14.110]  The Justice Department and FBI are investigating whether Roger Stone, Alex Jones played a role in the Capitol siege report sets.
[00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:14.831]  Oh my gosh!
[00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:18.642]  People call me, family calls me, they say, are you concerned?
[00:25:18.642 --> 00:25:20.344]  No, I'm not concerned.
[00:25:20.344 --> 00:25:21.225]  I'm worried about the country.
[00:25:21.225 --> 00:25:24.268]  I know who did it.
[00:25:24.268 --> 00:25:26.910]  I know who ran the attack.
[00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:38.981]  I know the Democrat organizations who have the history of it, who we caught involved, and who bragged and organized it, who ran the Q movement, and who manipulated 200 people out of a million to do that, and who ordered the police to stand out.
[00:25:38.981 --> 00:25:40.423]  Why do you think Lindsey Graham said,
[00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:44.913]  The day they ended the windshut of Trump a week and a half ago.
[00:25:44.913 --> 00:25:51.759]  Why do you think Lindsey Graham said, what did Pelosi know and when did she know it?
[00:25:51.759 --> 00:25:56.703]  He knows she was briefed two weeks before, a week before and a day before and she didn't tell even the Democrats.
[00:25:56.703 --> 00:26:03.229]  They knew the attack was coming and it turns out other Democrats bragged to Time Magazine that they knew and staged it.
[00:26:03.229 --> 00:26:05.010]  And we have undercover recordings.
[00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:06.952]  It's all next hour.
[00:26:06.952 --> 00:26:09.154]  This is the most incredible information
[00:26:09.716 --> 00:26:14.318]  When it comes to exposing it, right as they try to saddle the American people with all of this.
[00:26:14.318 --> 00:26:23.882]  So, I'm gonna play for you when we come back, General Idre, am I pronouncing that right this time?
[00:26:23.882 --> 00:26:25.663]  Honoré, I know I'm being sarcastic.
[00:26:25.663 --> 00:26:37.988]  General Honoré, I'm gonna play you General Honoré, talking about confiscating your guns and taking your guns, and saying no one will be alarmed, no one will be armed,
[00:26:38.835 --> 00:26:40.577]  Suddenly Joe Biden suddenly can't talk.
[00:26:40.577 --> 00:26:43.180]  No one will be allowed to be armed.
[00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:47.445]  All the guns will be taken.
[00:26:47.445 --> 00:26:49.027]  You know, I'm not the oldest president in U.S.
[00:26:49.027 --> 00:26:49.367]  history.
[00:26:49.367 --> 00:26:49.628]  I'm just 47.
[00:26:49.628 --> 00:26:52.431]  Maybe I'm getting seen off now too.
[00:26:52.431 --> 00:26:54.713]  But that's the thing about being teleprompter free.
[00:26:54.713 --> 00:26:56.916]  Sometimes your mind is completely sharp, doesn't...
[00:26:57.469 --> 00:27:20.109]  I could needle going down the record, hit the exact spot, but when we come back, I'm gonna lay all of that out for you and play the clips from back when Katrina took place, of the incredible excuse to go into high and dry areas and take old ladies guns, widows guns, old men's guns, veterans guns, and then a lot of the feds started just robbing with the local police, Walmart, and other stores.
[00:27:20.109 --> 00:27:21.971]  Remember all that?
[00:27:21.971 --> 00:27:24.513]  So if you want to see the criminality of who works for the government,
[00:27:25.424 --> 00:27:27.025]  You're going to see it coming up next segment.
[00:27:27.025 --> 00:27:35.167]  It's not everybody, but the government's so compartmentalized, good guys can't stop bad guys, so good guys work right next to giant compartments of bad guys.
[00:27:35.167 --> 00:27:42.549]  That's why it's so important, ladies and gentlemen, during these incredibly dangerous times, to keep InfoWars on the air.
[00:27:42.549 --> 00:27:45.230]  Without you, we're not going to be able to stay on air.
[00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:47.011]  Without you, we're not going to be here.
[00:27:47.011 --> 00:27:49.892]  And I'm just going to keep going to the end, no matter what happens.
[00:27:49.892 --> 00:27:50.592]  They want to get us.
[00:27:50.592 --> 00:27:52.192]  They want to put us in prison.
[00:27:52.192 --> 00:27:53.293]  They want to persecute us.
[00:27:53.293 --> 00:27:53.913]  That's okay.
[00:27:53.913 --> 00:27:54.453]  I expect
[00:27:55.638 --> 00:27:57.800]  To be attacked when I'm over the target.
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:00.522]  When you're over the target, all the guns are aimed at you.
[00:28:00.522 --> 00:28:02.503]  So I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:28:02.503 --> 00:28:08.828]  I want to let you know that the high-quality, affordable food we have is ready to be shipped to you within a day of your order.
[00:28:08.828 --> 00:28:12.250]  It's shipped out from four locations across the United States.
[00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:13.431]  It's 10% off.
[00:28:13.431 --> 00:28:14.932]  It's high-quality, affordable food.
[00:28:14.932 --> 00:28:17.274]  The highest quality you're going to find for the price.
[00:28:18.243 --> 00:28:25.287]  You can pay three, four, five times and find some that taste a little bit better, but it is not inexpensive and high quality like this.
[00:28:25.287 --> 00:28:28.208]  This is the best food for the price you're going to find.
[00:28:28.208 --> 00:28:33.691]  PrepareWithAlex.com takes you right to the sub page of InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:28:34.671 --> 00:28:38.053]  That's InfoWarsStore.com or PreparedAlex.com.
[00:28:38.053 --> 00:28:48.059]  For a limited time, a big discount because of the emergency, all the craziness, an additional 10% off rate of ship out to you in waterproof packaging and so much more anywhere in the world, really.
[00:28:48.059 --> 00:28:50.361]  So InfoWarsStore.com or PreparedAlex.com.
[00:28:50.361 --> 00:28:52.722]  There's a bunch of other big specials as well on the site.
[00:28:52.722 --> 00:28:53.743]  Take advantage of those.
[00:28:53.743 --> 00:28:54.283]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:58.383 --> 00:29:06.609]  As negative as times are right now, and as depressing as things can be, you have to understand that this is all a test.
[00:29:06.609 --> 00:29:12.654]  This experience, this life on this planet, is a reckoning.
[00:29:12.654 --> 00:29:21.521]  It's God giving us a chance to work things out in the third dimension, so we can decide where we want to spend eternity, and what level we want to go to.
[00:29:21.521 --> 00:29:22.762]  And it really does come down to that.
[00:29:23.963 --> 00:29:31.366]  As sad as things are and as evil as things are, look at all the good in the world as well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness.
[00:29:31.366 --> 00:29:34.988]  God is the author of us having our own will.
[00:29:34.988 --> 00:29:37.929]  God is the author of us having free will.
[00:29:37.929 --> 00:29:40.570]  And that free will is a beautiful thing.
[00:29:41.261 --> 00:29:45.523]  When you look at mainstream media and Hollywood and this whole evil culture and Washington D.C.
[00:29:45.523 --> 00:29:50.625]  and Falchi and the mass cult, it's all about dominating your free will.
[00:29:50.625 --> 00:29:53.406]  It's all about telling you you're dirty, you're ugly, you're in the bad.
[00:29:53.406 --> 00:29:57.408]  Because Satan hates you because you're made in the image of God, the creator of the universe.
[00:29:58.590 --> 00:30:09.895]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schroyer here, the host of the InfoWars War Room, and I have had a major wake-up call living in Texas this last week about how important storable food is.
[00:30:09.895 --> 00:30:22.821]  Now, I have plenty of storable food in my house, but my notion has always been this is last case scenario, worst case scenario, like end of America, apocalyptic type scenario, but I'm realizing now that's not the case.
[00:30:22.821 --> 00:30:26.603]  Folks, they can shut off the power, they can shut off the water at any given moment.
[00:30:26.963 --> 00:30:32.913]  Now, I was lucky I had plenty of food in my fridge and in my pantry that I didn't have to dig into my storable food.
[00:30:32.913 --> 00:30:35.096]  But many people in Texas didn't.
[00:30:35.096 --> 00:30:36.598]  Don't be in that situation.
[00:30:36.598 --> 00:30:38.421]  Don't have that major wake-up call.
[00:30:38.421 --> 00:30:41.987]  When they come to shut down your power and they shut down the stores and the food supply,
[00:30:42.856 --> 00:30:58.304]  Have the backup, have the insurance, and be ready to feed yourself, your family, your friends, and your neighbors with a storable food, best quality, best price, 10% off right now at InfowarStore.com.
[00:30:58.304 --> 00:30:59.224]  We told you it was coming.
[00:31:02.228 --> 00:31:10.995]  Or, for eight months they've made citizens wear bracelets on their arms that make them a social distance and report them back to cell towers to track their every movement.
[00:31:10.995 --> 00:31:12.136]  This is for everybody.
[00:31:12.136 --> 00:31:13.657]  The way it gets better.
[00:31:13.657 --> 00:31:24.226]  Now France has programs in their factories, government-pushed and sponsored, to make everyone wear actual dog collars that make them social distance and report back to civil computers.
[00:31:24.226 --> 00:31:25.867]  They're turning it into a commodity.
[00:31:26.407 --> 00:31:28.910]  Human-animal clones have been around for 50 years.
[00:31:28.910 --> 00:31:30.071]  It's all being announced.
[00:31:30.071 --> 00:31:34.535]  They are literally taking over the life cycle of humans and making us obsolete.
[00:31:34.535 --> 00:31:40.040]  And big corporations downplay that they own us with these gene therapy systems and patents that they've produced.
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:40.980]  Do you understand?
[00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:41.681]  It is a fake news.
[00:31:41.741 --> 00:31:42.902]  I knew Trump was embattled.
[00:31:42.902 --> 00:31:46.604]  I knew he was surrounded by cowards and by double talking agents of the enemy.
[00:31:46.604 --> 00:31:48.285]  And a lot of people just couldn't believe it.
[00:32:10.683 --> 00:32:14.587]  They're like, oh no, it's 3D chess, 5D chess, he's invincible.
[00:32:14.587 --> 00:32:18.070]  And I understand why people wanted to believe that, because this is scary what's going on.
[00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:23.695]  The global government, the new world order, and now that people woke up to the fact that that's real, they want somebody to come save them from.
[00:32:23.695 --> 00:32:25.677]  Well, Trump sure as hell tried.
[00:32:25.677 --> 00:32:31.763]  My gosh, look it out, prescription drug prices just tripled or quadrupled, depending on the drug, once Biden signed that executive order.
[00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:33.781]  We pay the most money in the world.
[00:32:33.781 --> 00:32:37.384]  That's just one case of hundreds of things that Trump had reversed.
[00:32:37.384 --> 00:32:40.426]  And now people are going to feel the sting and the pain.
[00:32:40.426 --> 00:32:41.707]  Energy costs, everything else.
[00:32:41.707 --> 00:32:52.915]  But what's really illustrated this is the trial in the Senate where Trump's own lawyers are attacking him and putting him down and saying he lost the election and just engaged in all sorts of criminal activity.
[00:32:52.915 --> 00:32:54.796]  Because the fix is in, folks.
[00:32:54.796 --> 00:32:56.318]  The swamp is deep.
[00:32:56.318 --> 00:32:58.099]  Trump fought it, but it's up to us to win it.
[00:33:01.042 --> 00:33:04.304]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:04.304 --> 00:33:12.069]  So, we've got the Lieutenant General
[00:33:31.383 --> 00:33:42.805]  Russell Honore, who helped lead the unconstitutional criminal gun confiscation in Katrina, back during George W. Bush and all his nightmare activity.
[00:33:42.805 --> 00:33:45.246]  Coming out last week, Tucker Carlson covered it.
[00:33:45.246 --> 00:33:47.206]  We covered it two weeks ago.
[00:33:47.206 --> 00:33:53.247]  Just in video conferences and in public statements and in tweets saying, we need to just arrest Trump supporters.
[00:33:53.247 --> 00:33:54.527]  We need to kill them.
[00:33:54.527 --> 00:33:55.887]  We need to put them in FEMA camps.
[00:33:55.887 --> 00:33:57.368]  We need to put them on a fly list.
[00:33:57.368 --> 00:33:58.548]  We need to take their guns.
[00:33:59.733 --> 00:34:01.834]  I mean, this guy is a punk.
[00:34:01.834 --> 00:34:04.135]  This guy's an un-American thug.
[00:34:04.135 --> 00:34:08.558]  But he's par for the course for the generals that they've got up there.
[00:34:08.558 --> 00:34:17.222]  And so he's been prepared and is in charge now of this New Pretorian Guard of purging the U.S.
[00:34:17.222 --> 00:34:19.103]  military of, quote, white supremacists.
[00:34:19.103 --> 00:34:26.507]  That means anybody that supports Trump, anybody that supports America, anybody that supports the Constitutional Republic.
[00:34:29.019 --> 00:34:34.704]  And so, Americans have to come to grips with that.
[00:34:34.704 --> 00:34:37.005]  They have to come... Zoom in a little bit closer for me.
[00:34:37.005 --> 00:34:38.987]  I want to do it with Dr. McHam's being on the article.
[00:34:38.987 --> 00:34:40.568]  Just like, boom, right there is what I want.
[00:34:40.568 --> 00:34:42.009]  Thanks.
[00:34:42.009 --> 00:34:44.571]  And so, that's where we are as a republic.
[00:34:44.571 --> 00:34:46.473]  That's where we are as a country.
[00:34:46.473 --> 00:34:58.082]  And we have to ask ourselves, is this a good thing to have the Democrats in league with the Communist Chinese that are pushing open borders, cutting off our pipelines,
[00:34:59.329 --> 00:35:09.394]  That are demoralizing our nation, that are telling us that men are going to compete in women's sports, that are just doing everything you can to wreck the psyche and morale of the people.
[00:35:09.394 --> 00:35:10.075]  Is that a good thing?
[00:35:10.075 --> 00:35:11.416]  And the answer is no.
[00:35:11.416 --> 00:35:23.622]  If we recognize it's an assault, if we recognize it's meant to break us up, if we recognize it's meant to make us kill each other, then we can override it and not have the civil war we want to avoid.
[00:35:23.622 --> 00:35:25.283]  Instead of laying down
[00:35:27.591 --> 00:35:28.592]  To the globalists.
[00:35:28.592 --> 00:35:29.552]  We don't want to lay down.
[00:35:29.552 --> 00:35:31.413]  We don't want to give them the civil war they want.
[00:35:31.413 --> 00:35:38.376]  We want to have a cultural awakening to them and fully resist everything they stand for and everything they do.
[00:35:38.376 --> 00:35:40.758]  It's that simple.
[00:35:40.758 --> 00:35:44.360]  So let me play you these two clips back to back right now.
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:51.003]  One is the police and the National Guard under General Russell Honore's directive
[00:35:51.744 --> 00:35:54.907]  Many years ago, he's now been resurrected through this on an actual scale.
[00:35:54.907 --> 00:35:56.528]  Biden's got the bills introduced.
[00:35:56.528 --> 00:36:05.195]  Says he's gonna move forward with executive orders outside of law, register all guns, confiscate all semi-autos, ban all magazines above nine rounds.
[00:36:05.195 --> 00:36:06.817]  I mean, it's all been announced.
[00:36:06.817 --> 00:36:13.262]  He says if Congress doesn't pass it within 60 days, executive order, and we're off to the races.
[00:36:13.262 --> 00:36:16.885]  And a weird, crazy, female America hater is in charge of it all.
[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:20.862]  Then the next clip is the clergy response teams.
[00:36:20.862 --> 00:36:36.232]  They've gotten preachers all over the country on the federal payroll, little FBI badges, brainwashed that when the crisis goes down, tell you to take the microchip, tell you to take the vaccine, tell you to turn your guns in, tell you to go to the FEMA camp.
[00:36:36.232 --> 00:36:38.273]  And so that's what this is, is the takedown of the country.
[00:36:38.273 --> 00:36:42.296]  It's why they're on the news saying, re-educate us, brainwash us.
[00:36:42.296 --> 00:36:43.557]  It's why they're on the news.
[00:36:44.958 --> 00:36:53.120]  Over and over and over and over again, teaching us that we're bad.
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:54.460]  This is a takeover.
[00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:57.881]  That's why they cut the communications off.
[00:36:57.881 --> 00:36:59.342]  They're preparing to devalue the dollar.
[00:36:59.342 --> 00:37:00.622]  They're already doing it.
[00:37:00.622 --> 00:37:04.383]  I mean, we're in rough shape, and I'm just not going to lie to you about it.
[00:37:04.383 --> 00:37:08.744]  Trump fought hard, but the Q movement neutralized him and said, he's invincible.
[00:37:08.744 --> 00:37:09.364]  Everything's fine.
[00:37:09.364 --> 00:37:10.364]  Don't get involved.
[00:37:10.364 --> 00:37:12.485]  To make sure while the left was active, you weren't.
[00:37:13.092 --> 00:37:23.441]  Well, most of this audience saw through it, but I keep hammering back to Q. As you'll see next hour, we exposed the main propaganda group they used with Antifa to take over a few right-wingers to attack the Capitol.
[00:37:23.441 --> 00:37:31.267]  You understand how critical they are, because they're planning to try to provoke a tour of more stuff on March 4th, where they claim Trump's about to take over and be the president again.
[00:37:31.267 --> 00:37:35.311]  When I assure you, that's not the case.
[00:37:35.311 --> 00:37:39.294]  So we've got to kill the CIA globalist system
[00:37:39.938 --> 00:37:40.938]  That Q is.
[00:37:40.938 --> 00:37:44.180]  We've got to kill its credibility, not physically kill it.
[00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:46.941]  We've got to get people to understand what it really is.
[00:37:46.941 --> 00:37:48.381]  This is a sophisticated sign-off.
[00:37:48.381 --> 00:37:50.022]  Because I know you want a bunch of good news.
[00:37:50.022 --> 00:37:51.922]  I understand that.
[00:37:51.922 --> 00:37:54.083]  But I'm not going to sit there and give you fake news, folks, okay?
[00:37:54.083 --> 00:37:57.525]  I'm going to give you the reality, as best I know it.
[00:37:57.525 --> 00:37:58.725]  So here's the two clubs back-to-back.
[00:38:04.835 --> 00:38:07.417]  ABC World News, September 8, 2005.
[00:38:07.417 --> 00:38:13.220]  That includes New Orleans, where today authorities stepped up their efforts to empty the city.
[00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:17.023]  Bob Woodruff is there again tonight with an extraordinary human drama unfolding.
[00:38:17.023 --> 00:38:19.044]  Bob?
[00:38:19.044 --> 00:38:20.885]  That's true, Elizabeth, and good evening from New Orleans.
[00:38:20.885 --> 00:38:30.852]  Here the police and the National Guard find themselves in a very difficult position tonight to try to carry out an order to force people from the city without actually using force.
[00:38:35.518 --> 00:38:40.559]  Today in New Orleans, they got a lot tougher on the holdouts.
[00:38:40.559 --> 00:38:48.241]  Not only the flooded areas, but New Orleans' driest and wealthiest neighborhoods, too.
[00:38:48.241 --> 00:38:54.382]  The police and National Guard going street by street, house to house.
[00:38:54.382 --> 00:38:58.063]  We need to make sure, too, that whenever we knock on doors, people refuse to leave.
[00:38:58.063 --> 00:38:59.703]  We need to make note, call it in.
[00:39:01.014 --> 00:39:05.077]  They say there are no orders to use force, just strong persuasion.
[00:39:05.077 --> 00:39:08.800]  Sometimes entering open houses with guns drawn.
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:12.363]  And instructions to disarm anyone inside.
[00:39:12.363 --> 00:39:13.144]  You say guns?
[00:39:13.144 --> 00:39:14.044]  Guns will be taken.
[00:39:14.044 --> 00:39:15.465]  No one will be able to be armed.
[00:39:15.465 --> 00:39:17.187]  We will take all weapons.
[00:39:17.187 --> 00:39:23.852]  That happened today in this wealthy neighborhood, where homeowners armed themselves to... Back it up ten seconds, please.
[00:39:23.852 --> 00:39:23.932]  Um...
[00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:29.281]  Later it came out on the Fox News, and our own reporters covered it.
[00:39:29.281 --> 00:39:34.123]  They went into high and dry areas, surrounding cities, took guns, robbed people's houses.
[00:39:34.123 --> 00:39:36.103]  The military did, and the police did later.
[00:39:36.103 --> 00:39:38.024]  The Louisiana police did.
[00:39:38.024 --> 00:39:41.625]  They're not all crooks, but again, they don't control the ones that are crooks, so they have to let them do it.
[00:39:41.625 --> 00:39:42.265]  Very corrupt.
[00:39:42.265 --> 00:39:43.706]  That's how it works.
[00:39:43.706 --> 00:39:47.327]  And so again, they did take everybody's guns, and they did not use force.
[00:39:47.327 --> 00:39:48.127]  That's all a damn lie.
[00:39:48.127 --> 00:39:50.688]  You have the famous footage of the old lady, they're taking the revolver from her.
[00:39:51.207 --> 00:39:52.168]  So, let's continue.
[00:39:52.168 --> 00:39:56.870]  Imagine they took them out of their houses that were high and dry, made them go to the super domes, they could be gang raped.
[00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:59.611]  Let's continue.
[00:39:59.611 --> 00:40:01.812]  ...arm anyone inside.
[00:40:01.812 --> 00:40:03.473]  You say guns will be taken?
[00:40:03.473 --> 00:40:04.934]  No one will be able to be armed.
[00:40:04.934 --> 00:40:06.655]  We will take all weapons.
[00:40:06.655 --> 00:40:13.598]  That happened today in this wealthy neighborhood where homeowners had armed themselves to protect their mansions.
[00:40:13.598 --> 00:40:15.919]  Residents were handcuffed on the ground.
[00:40:15.919 --> 00:40:19.041]  In the end, police took their weapons but let them stay in their homes.
[00:40:19.554 --> 00:40:24.097]  They were a little bit threatened because our weapons were bigger than their weapons.
[00:40:24.097 --> 00:40:30.480]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:33.942]  This guard unit occupied a church, using it as a base camp.
[00:40:33.942 --> 00:40:37.724]  They had to leave a note because they could not get hold of the pastor to get permission.
[00:40:37.724 --> 00:40:39.565]  It is, it is surreal.
[00:40:39.565 --> 00:40:43.027]  You just never, you never expect to do this in your own country.
[00:40:43.931 --> 00:40:48.696]  Chris Montgomery says he'd rather be in Iraq than patrolling American neighborhoods.
[00:40:48.696 --> 00:40:53.462]  Walking up and down these streets, you don't... you don't want to think about the stuff that you have to do.
[00:40:53.462 --> 00:40:56.125]  Somebody pops around the corner, and they shoot an American.
[00:40:57.868 --> 00:41:00.749]  Law ever become a reality in America?
[00:41:00.749 --> 00:41:05.110]  Some fear any nuclear, biological, or chemical attack on U.S.
[00:41:05.110 --> 00:41:07.670]  territory might trigger just that.
[00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:14.512]  NSK's Late News 12's Jeff Ferrell discovered the clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem.
[00:41:14.512 --> 00:41:15.452]  Us.
[00:41:15.452 --> 00:41:18.192]  From my cold, dead hands!
[00:41:18.192 --> 00:41:22.793]  Charlton Heston's famous declaration captures a truly American value.
[00:41:22.793 --> 00:41:25.414]  The overarching desire to protect our freedoms.
[00:41:26.098 --> 00:41:33.042]  But gun confiscation is exactly what happened during the state of emergency following Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.
[00:41:33.042 --> 00:41:33.382]  U.S.
[00:41:33.382 --> 00:41:42.127]  troops also arrived, something far easier to do even now thanks to last year's elimination of the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act.
[00:41:42.127 --> 00:41:43.268]  That forbid U.S.
[00:41:43.268 --> 00:41:45.309]  troops from policing on American soil.
[00:41:47.526 --> 00:41:55.169]  If martial law were enacted here at home, like depicted in the movie The Siege, easing public fears and quelling dissent would be critical.
[00:41:55.169 --> 00:42:00.812]  And that's exactly what the Clergy Response Team, as it's called, helped accomplish in New Orleans.
[00:42:00.812 --> 00:42:07.654]  Jeff, the primary thing that we say to anybody is, let's go out there and get this thing over with, and then we'll settle the differences once the crisis is over.
[00:42:07.654 --> 00:42:13.517]  Such Clergy Response Teams would walk a tightrope between the needs of the government versus the wishes of the public.
[00:42:14.037 --> 00:42:21.159]  In a lot of cases, these clergy would already be known in the neighborhoods in which they're helping to defuse that situation.
[00:42:21.159 --> 00:42:29.001]  For the clergy, one of the biggest tools that they will have in helping calm the public down or obey the law is the Bible itself.
[00:42:29.001 --> 00:42:30.941]  Specifically, Romans.
[00:42:30.941 --> 00:42:31.361]  Romans 13.
[00:42:31.361 --> 00:42:32.342]  Alright, that's enough.
[00:42:32.342 --> 00:42:34.142]  That's Romans 13.
[00:42:34.142 --> 00:42:35.402]  Render unto Caesar what's Caesar.
[00:42:35.402 --> 00:42:39.203]  They were trying to trick Christ so they could kill him.
[00:42:39.203 --> 00:42:39.624]  Saying what?
[00:42:39.624 --> 00:42:40.604]  You're not going to pay taxes?
[00:42:40.604 --> 00:42:41.304]  Caesar's on this.
[00:42:42.432 --> 00:42:43.413]  I sell supplements for two reasons.
[00:42:43.413 --> 00:42:46.154]  Because they work, they're real, they're powerful, and because it's a giant market.
[00:42:46.154 --> 00:42:47.675]  But again, why is there a giant market?
[00:42:47.675 --> 00:42:48.315]  Because it works.
[00:43:10.646 --> 00:43:12.648]  That's why it exponentially grows.
[00:43:12.648 --> 00:43:29.120]  So whether it's Saw Palmetto and other key ingredients in our Prostate Formula, Prostagard, or whether it is the super high-grade Organic Vitamin B12 in Ultra-12, or whether it's the PQQ or the CoQ10 in DNA Force,
[00:43:30.077 --> 00:43:33.159]  Or the pure Deep Earth Crystal Iodine X2.
[00:43:33.159 --> 00:43:41.305]  These are all the very best supplements you're going to find in an already great market of high quality products out there.
[00:43:41.305 --> 00:43:42.986]  And it funds the InfoWars.
[00:43:42.986 --> 00:43:47.389]  So even if these products weren't high quality, which they are, you're funding the InfoWars, you can't lose.
[00:43:47.389 --> 00:43:49.691]  InfoWars delivers in spades.
[00:43:49.691 --> 00:43:53.133]  Please visit InfoWarsStore.com and get the products contained.
[00:43:53.133 --> 00:43:56.596]  Again, I want to thank you all for keeping us on air at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:43:57.674 --> 00:43:59.235]  Now is the time to get prepared.
[00:43:59.235 --> 00:44:03.859]  Now is the time to get high quality storable food that's ready to be shipped to you within days.
[00:44:03.859 --> 00:44:10.705]  Infowarsstore.com has the highest quality storable food, recently processed and packaged, that I myself and my family use.
[00:44:10.705 --> 00:44:15.229]  And during the blackouts and freeze here in Texas, we were able to use food we bought from them years ago.
[00:44:15.649 --> 00:44:17.571]  Our supplier is My Patriot Supply.
[00:44:17.571 --> 00:44:23.657]  Buy it through MFORSTORE.COM or PREPAREWITHALEX.COM and get an additional 10% off because of the emergency.
[00:44:23.657 --> 00:44:32.666]  They weren't going to do sales for a long time, but because of the emergency, they have now said they're doing 10% off exclusively at PREPAREWITHALEX.COM or MFORSTORE.COM.
[00:44:32.666 --> 00:44:34.108]  That's PREPAREWITHALEX.COM

[00:44:58.661 --> 00:45:02.726]  I love the Patriot Blend Wake Up America Coffee.
[00:45:02.726 --> 00:45:04.008]  I just love it.
[00:45:04.008 --> 00:45:05.030]  I can't get enough of it.
[00:45:06.124 --> 00:45:08.405]  We got a fresh brew right now.
[00:45:08.405 --> 00:45:09.626]  That's what fills my mug.
[00:45:09.626 --> 00:45:10.786]  That's what fills my belly.
[00:45:10.786 --> 00:45:12.287]  That's what fills my soul.
[00:45:12.287 --> 00:45:14.208]  Wake Up America Patriot Blend Coffee.
[00:45:14.208 --> 00:45:18.350]  Folks, we have had this coffee for years at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:45:18.350 --> 00:45:18.970]  Years.
[00:45:18.970 --> 00:45:20.651]  Never raised the price.
[00:45:20.651 --> 00:45:20.951]  Never.
[00:45:20.951 --> 00:45:23.472]  The Wake Up America Blend, the best coffee.
[00:45:23.472 --> 00:45:24.652]  The crew here loves it.
[00:45:24.652 --> 00:45:25.873]  We drink it every day.
[00:45:25.873 --> 00:45:30.335]  And of course, that's just one of the great ways you can support InfoWars here.
[00:45:30.515 --> 00:45:32.879]  Everybody drinks coffee, or just about everybody.
[00:45:32.879 --> 00:45:38.467]  Why not support InfoWars and keep the coffee supply at your house with the Wake Up America Patriot Blend?
[00:45:38.467 --> 00:45:40.029]  Of course, read all the great reviews.
[00:45:40.029 --> 00:45:41.291]  Pretty much perfect review there.
[00:45:41.291 --> 00:45:42.352]  4.9 star.
[00:45:42.352 --> 00:45:46.018]  When you have thousands of reviews, it's impossible to have a perfect review unless
[00:45:46.318 --> 00:45:48.059]  Literally, everybody gives it five stars.
[00:45:48.059 --> 00:45:52.002]  So, I mean, if you have 4.9, that's pretty much everybody who gives it a five star, except maybe one or two people.
[00:45:52.002 --> 00:45:54.744]  Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee.
[00:45:54.744 --> 00:45:58.526]  Only available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:45:58.526 --> 00:46:02.389]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[00:46:02.389 --> 00:46:06.692]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[00:46:06.692 --> 00:46:15.158]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of Ultimate Fish Oil from InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:46:15.538 --> 00:46:32.172]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[00:46:32.172 --> 00:46:43.202]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[00:46:43.682 --> 00:46:52.185]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[00:46:52.185 --> 00:47:01.948]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:47:01.948 --> 00:47:04.589]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:17.017 --> 00:47:21.919]  Welcome back to the most censored, most lied about, most demonized broadcast in the world.
[00:47:21.919 --> 00:47:22.980]  We're teleprompter free.
[00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:24.921]  The globalists aren't telling me what to say.
[00:47:24.921 --> 00:47:26.041]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:47:26.041 --> 00:47:32.844]  Very, very honored to be joining you on this live Sunday, February 21st, 2020 transmission.
[00:47:32.844 --> 00:47:36.386]  Okay, I want to hit what really happened with the power outages.
[00:47:36.386 --> 00:47:37.246]  And you know what?
[00:47:37.246 --> 00:47:38.367]  Darn it.
[00:47:38.367 --> 00:47:42.849]  I was just back in my office and then talked to my wife that called me and I forgot to get it.
[00:47:43.607 --> 00:47:44.988]  So will somebody do me a huge favor?
[00:47:44.988 --> 00:47:51.371]  Will somebody run into my office, right in front of the computer, is a stack of articles about that thick, and just bring me that.
[00:47:51.371 --> 00:48:09.922]  But you guys are quick enough and good enough, you guys can actually pull up the document that I want to show from the Department of Energy, telling the state of Texas that they weren't going to turn the power on until they had a crisis, and the fact that the feds, there it is, so no need to go to my office now, were actually in control
[00:48:11.281 --> 00:48:12.442]  Of Texas Energy.
[00:48:12.442 --> 00:48:13.583]  Simply incredible.
[00:48:13.583 --> 00:48:16.004]  Let's still grab it off my desk, thanks.
[00:48:16.004 --> 00:48:17.826]  So that's coming up in just a moment.
[00:48:17.826 --> 00:48:18.586]  Smoking gun.
[00:48:18.586 --> 00:48:25.711]  Joe Biden, Department of Energy blocked Texas from increasing power ahead of storm.
[00:48:25.711 --> 00:48:38.600]  Now, before we hit that and show you the document, it's so incredible to have this story we're going to cover at the start of the next hour.
[00:48:39.361 --> 00:48:44.424]  New York Times, critical thinking isn't helping the fight against misinformation.
[00:48:44.424 --> 00:48:47.927]  That's an InfoWars.com posted story from Information Liberation.
[00:48:47.927 --> 00:48:52.310]  You're thinking, oh surely they didn't really say that.
[00:48:52.310 --> 00:48:55.992]  Here's a Charlie Wurzel, one of my stalkers.
[00:48:55.992 --> 00:48:58.254]  Don't go down the rabbit hole.
[00:48:58.254 --> 00:49:01.316]  He says that critical thinking is bad.
[00:49:01.316 --> 00:49:05.859]  He actually says, do not investigate.
[00:49:05.859 --> 00:49:09.041]  I always tell you, don't believe me, investigate.
[00:49:10.023 --> 00:49:14.325]  Don't believe me that India banned the Pfizer vaccine two weeks ago.
[00:49:14.325 --> 00:49:15.265]  Look it up.
[00:49:15.265 --> 00:49:16.546]  Help.
[00:49:16.546 --> 00:49:17.226]  Here it is right here.
[00:49:17.226 --> 00:49:18.706]  I'm going to show you next hour.
[00:49:18.706 --> 00:49:21.628]  Huge articles all over the world saying I'm a liar.
[00:49:21.628 --> 00:49:26.970]  Because see, they like discredit my name and then use me to discredit other things.
[00:49:26.970 --> 00:49:30.051]  Like, Jones claims India banned the Pfizer vaccine.
[00:49:30.051 --> 00:49:31.792]  It's not true.
[00:49:31.792 --> 00:49:36.974]  The story trended on Twitter as the number five trend and he needs to be arrested.
[00:49:36.974 --> 00:49:37.954]  He's going to kill people.
[00:49:38.826 --> 00:49:39.549]  Look at this.
[00:49:39.549 --> 00:49:41.356]  CNBC.
[00:49:41.356 --> 00:49:41.758]  February 5th.
[00:49:42.887 --> 00:49:44.888]  Told you it's been two weeks.
[00:49:44.888 --> 00:49:46.148]  I'm just dead on my memory.
[00:49:46.148 --> 00:49:47.169]  Two weeks ago.
[00:49:47.169 --> 00:49:57.493]  Pfizer withdraws application for emergency use of its COVID-19 vaccine in India after India says it caused deaths and people to be paralyzed in their own studies and said you can't do it.
[00:49:57.493 --> 00:50:01.735]  I'm going to show you the damn press release from the Indian government.
[00:50:01.735 --> 00:50:06.257]  Because remember, they were a colony of England, so they speak English over there.
[00:50:06.257 --> 00:50:07.297]  It's their main language.
[00:50:07.297 --> 00:50:08.758]  It's not Hindi.
[00:50:08.758 --> 00:50:09.598]  It's in English.
[00:50:09.598 --> 00:50:11.419]  It's not a translation.
[00:50:11.419 --> 00:50:12.019]  It's in English.
[00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:16.082]  It's real easy to understand.
[00:50:16.082 --> 00:50:23.747]  Oh, but Charlie Wurzel, also known as the Weasel, he says, don't do it.
[00:50:23.747 --> 00:50:27.489]  So that's coming up next hour.
[00:50:27.489 --> 00:50:40.377]  And then I'm going to show you the exclusive video and audio, thanks to the great work of investigative journalist Billy Weaver and others, of hired CNN operatives running the Capitol assault.
[00:50:40.377 --> 00:50:41.317]  On record.
[00:50:41.317 --> 00:50:42.058]  This is huge.
[00:50:42.774 --> 00:50:44.155]  The report is being prepared.
[00:50:44.155 --> 00:50:46.637]  We were shooting it up here this morning and this afternoon.
[00:50:46.637 --> 00:50:49.058]  We're adding so many clips, so much documentation.
[00:50:49.058 --> 00:50:50.779]  Everything I say, we're going to show you a clip.
[00:50:50.779 --> 00:50:52.760]  I'm like, I talk 5 seconds, 5 second clip.
[00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:54.742]  Talk 10 seconds, 10 second clip.
[00:50:54.742 --> 00:50:56.143]  Talk 30 seconds, 30 second clip.
[00:50:56.143 --> 00:50:58.264]  It's just total, everything I say, I show you.
[00:50:58.704 --> 00:51:01.185]  Oh, because I'm not like the New York Times.
[00:51:01.185 --> 00:51:02.186]  Oh, don't.
[00:51:02.186 --> 00:51:03.326]  Don't research things.
[00:51:03.326 --> 00:51:04.547]  Don't look deeper.
[00:51:04.547 --> 00:51:05.727]  It'll hurt your mind.
[00:51:05.727 --> 00:51:07.608]  It'll make you confused.
[00:51:07.608 --> 00:51:08.868]  It's a thought crime.
[00:51:08.868 --> 00:51:09.869]  It's terrible.
[00:51:09.869 --> 00:51:12.750]  We don't want to have to deplatform you or arrest you.
[00:51:12.750 --> 00:51:17.072]  Why, the Attorney General says if you don't like us, the government will arrest you.
[00:51:17.072 --> 00:51:22.394]  We've emptied out the prisons for you.
[00:51:22.394 --> 00:51:27.056]  So that's all coming up next hour.
[00:51:28.655 --> 00:51:44.389]  And I'm going to read from the Indian government, saying because of people being paralyzed, palsy, death, in the initial trials, that they banned it.
[00:51:44.389 --> 00:51:46.311]  They said they've not approved it.
[00:51:46.311 --> 00:51:49.854]  Oh, well I guess because it never got approved, it's technically not banned.
[00:51:49.854 --> 00:51:51.616]  What's the word for that?
[00:51:51.616 --> 00:51:52.817]  It's unauthorized.
[00:51:52.817 --> 00:51:53.858]  I'm sorry, Snopes.
[00:51:55.855 --> 00:51:57.936]  Just thank God I don't make a living lying to people.
[00:51:57.936 --> 00:51:59.917]  My God, what must it be like?
[00:51:59.917 --> 00:52:01.437]  The evil.
[00:52:01.437 --> 00:52:02.358]  The soullessness.
[00:52:02.358 --> 00:52:08.120]  That's why they're so desperate to shut us off air, so they can just lie to you and gaslight you forever.
[00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:10.841]  But let's move on to this.
[00:52:10.841 --> 00:52:13.502]  Any regular listener of the show doesn't have to believe me.
[00:52:13.502 --> 00:52:14.602]  You saw what Obama did.
[00:52:14.602 --> 00:52:16.323]  In fact, guys, I meant to tell you this.
[00:52:16.323 --> 00:52:16.723]  I forgot.
[00:52:16.723 --> 00:52:17.283]  I apologize.
[00:52:17.283 --> 00:52:19.044]  The poor, embattled crew, they do a great job.
[00:52:19.044 --> 00:52:22.005]  But you guys pull up, Obama says he will bankrupt coal.
[00:52:22.005 --> 00:52:24.066]  Remember when he was running for office?
[00:52:25.410 --> 00:52:26.212]  Fifteen years ago?
[00:52:26.212 --> 00:52:33.206]  He said, oh you can build a coal power plant, we'll put a tax on it so high it'll bankrupt you.
[00:52:33.206 --> 00:52:35.130]  What that really means is we'll bankrupt the people.
[00:52:37.208 --> 00:52:39.130]  And coal-powered plants will operate the cold.
[00:52:39.130 --> 00:52:41.012]  You can turn them right on, turn them right off.
[00:52:41.012 --> 00:52:41.913]  It's totally clean.
[00:52:41.913 --> 00:52:44.896]  Only water vapor comes out with carbon dioxide.
[00:52:44.896 --> 00:52:45.836]  Not carbon monoxide.
[00:52:45.836 --> 00:52:47.318]  Carbon dioxide plants breathe.
[00:52:47.318 --> 00:52:47.778]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:52:47.778 --> 00:52:50.781]  President Obama keeps promise to bankrupt coal industry.
[00:52:50.781 --> 00:52:56.467]  But there's three speeches he gave where he said, we're going to bankrupt coal.
[00:52:57.583 --> 00:52:58.584]  And hell, Biden's doing it.
[00:52:58.584 --> 00:53:00.145]  He turned off the Keystone Pipeline.
[00:53:00.145 --> 00:53:01.486]  Everything else, that's just oil.
[00:53:01.486 --> 00:53:02.667]  Can't have that either.
[00:53:02.667 --> 00:53:05.429]  San Francisco's banning gas-powered stoves.
[00:53:05.429 --> 00:53:06.390]  Can't have gas either.
[00:53:06.390 --> 00:53:07.651]  Even though it's totally clean.
[00:53:07.651 --> 00:53:08.151]  Doesn't matter.
[00:53:08.151 --> 00:53:08.912]  Can't have that either.
[00:53:08.912 --> 00:53:15.277]  Gotta buy electricity from them, wherever the hell they're getting it.
[00:53:15.277 --> 00:53:16.297]  So, smoking gun.
[00:53:16.297 --> 00:53:18.039]  Oh yeah, there's the clip.
[00:53:18.039 --> 00:53:20.080]  When you got audio, let me know and I'll play it.
[00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:20.781]  Smoking gun.
[00:53:22.330 --> 00:53:27.112]  Joe Biden's Department of Energy blocked Texas from increasing power ahead of killer storm.
[00:53:27.112 --> 00:53:49.741]  You can go read it for yourself where it says we need relief in the document from the fact that the federal government won't let us increase the output at our coal power plants, at our hydroelectric plants, and at our gas power plants, and that the windmills froze up and one reactor failed.
[00:53:50.672 --> 00:53:52.916]  Nuclear reactor, because they didn't want to rise it.
[00:53:52.916 --> 00:53:58.345]  So you had all this going on, but the reason that the main thing happened... Please put the document back on screen.
[00:53:58.345 --> 00:54:01.510]  The reason that the main thing happened...
[00:54:02.967 --> 00:54:13.516]  Is because they shut down over 120 power plants under Obama, and then they were always saying Trump was a Russian agent, was about to be out at any moment, so Trump tried to get companies to turn back on in Texas.
[00:54:13.516 --> 00:54:23.584]  They used to supply most of the country, at least 15 states, and they said, sorry, we don't think you'll be there, we're not going to turn back on, we think they'll remove you and somebody else will turn it off.
[00:54:23.584 --> 00:54:29.129]  And so, we're operating on 40-year-old nuclear reactor, two reactors in Houston,
[00:54:29.730 --> 00:54:31.611]  We're just like the Russians were.
[00:54:31.611 --> 00:54:36.252]  We're operating on a bunch of scam windmills that are 300 miles from the main cities they supply.
[00:54:36.252 --> 00:54:37.652]  So almost all the power's lost.
[00:54:37.652 --> 00:54:40.353]  We're operating on a bunch of natural gas stuff.
[00:54:40.353 --> 00:54:45.194]  And we bought natural gas because they're clean and healthy and they're what everybody says you should get.
[00:54:45.194 --> 00:54:47.735]  They're all the mainline stores sell.
[00:54:47.735 --> 00:54:53.036]  And we have two of the damn things and they wouldn't work and they failed when all the power was off to fully power us.
[00:54:53.036 --> 00:54:56.197]  So I went out and got a big-ass diesel generator and it worked great and got us back on air.
[00:54:57.819 --> 00:54:58.779]  But we already know that.
[00:54:58.779 --> 00:55:03.900]  Fossil fuels burn at the site clean and explosively, so they drive those pistons.
[00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:05.461]  They drive those turbines.
[00:55:05.461 --> 00:55:08.301]  They give you good, clean energy, like in your car.
[00:55:08.301 --> 00:55:17.804]  Instead of driving around in some electric lawnmower, that by the way, took more fossil fuel to burn to send it down the power lines, even if it's from windmills.
[00:55:17.804 --> 00:55:21.504]  The average windmill takes 20 years to pay for the carbon that went in it.
[00:55:21.504 --> 00:55:22.925]  And by the way, carbon isn't bad.
[00:55:22.925 --> 00:55:23.745]  It's what plants breathe.
[00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:29.881]  But they chose it because it's everywhere and they can tax it and track it and control it.
[00:55:29.881 --> 00:55:34.062]  So, it's a big document, it's a big article, it's at Infowars.com.
[00:55:34.062 --> 00:55:35.763]  I suggest you get it.
[00:55:35.763 --> 00:55:48.466]  I'm going to ask our great writer, Jamie White, who's up here on Sundays, to retake this article and repost it in the live show feed so people can see the link and find it easily and read the document for yourself.
[00:55:48.466 --> 00:55:54.587]  Got the governor begging them, let us please turn up these plants ahead of the storm getting here, and they said no.
[00:55:55.777 --> 00:55:59.478]  Not until your power fails and until you've been buying it from outside sources.
[00:55:59.478 --> 00:56:04.419]  By then, it was Sunday night, the power had been off in most areas, and it was too late.
[00:56:04.419 --> 00:56:11.800]  And then, oh, you're allowed to now up your carbon without fines or enforcement.
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:13.100]  And that's all in there.
[00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:23.722]  And then now Biden can come as the gracious lord and look at the pathetic Texas that everyone from around the country is running to to get away from him and the blue cities, and he can sit there and do that.
[00:56:28.712 --> 00:56:35.316]  So, when we come back next hour, we're pulling it in, I'm going to get you the clip of Obama saying, we're going to bankrupt the coal plants.
[00:56:35.316 --> 00:56:37.637]  But, you already know that!
[00:56:37.637 --> 00:56:39.759]  And so, that's what caused this!
[00:56:39.759 --> 00:56:43.081]  Now, technically, it's true!
[00:56:43.081 --> 00:56:47.323]  What Bill Gates said when he said, well, the main reason was the gas plants failed.
[00:56:47.323 --> 00:56:52.706]  Yeah, because the wind doesn't work, and two reactors doesn't run the state of Texas, a nuclear reactor.
[00:56:52.706 --> 00:56:55.328]  They shut down the other ones because they were too old.
[00:56:55.328 --> 00:56:56.629]  The Houston one should be shut down, too.
[00:56:57.381 --> 00:57:00.884]  Because they're supposed to only run 30 years, and it's been running 42 years.
[00:57:00.884 --> 00:57:07.010]  And then, we have all these gas-powered plants that don't operate in the cold, because it's not very powerful!
[00:57:07.010 --> 00:57:10.273]  I'm going to explain that again.
[00:57:10.273 --> 00:57:14.136]  We couldn't bring these generators in the office, because they put off carbon monoxide.
[00:57:14.136 --> 00:57:14.977]  It'd kill us.
[00:57:14.977 --> 00:57:16.398]  We had to put them outside.
[00:57:16.398 --> 00:57:20.081]  And in 20-degree weather, the damn things wouldn't work!
[00:57:20.081 --> 00:57:21.723]  And we're conking out forever!
[00:57:22.839 --> 00:57:29.224]  So we were off the air for a while after the batteries failed until we basically waited until a place opened that had generators.
[00:57:29.224 --> 00:57:31.366]  They were closed, went and paid them extra to get one.
[00:57:31.366 --> 00:57:33.047]  It's unbelievable.
[00:57:33.047 --> 00:57:34.268]  I'm going to show it all to you when we come back.
[00:57:34.268 --> 00:57:37.951]  I'm going to play you the Obama-Biden.
[00:57:37.951 --> 00:57:40.072]  It's the same person, the same global situation.
[00:57:40.072 --> 00:57:41.513]  The country's under attack.
[00:57:41.513 --> 00:57:42.754]  China has plenty of power.
[00:57:42.754 --> 00:57:45.076]  They're shutting our power off so we can't do business.
[00:57:45.076 --> 00:57:46.057]  Hour 2 straight ahead.
[00:57:48.203 --> 00:57:54.850]  In the early 1990s, there was a really funny movie that came out called Wayne's World.
[00:57:54.850 --> 00:58:02.697]  Even before I had asked this TV show in the mid-1990s, I went and saw that movie and thought, man, that looks fun.
[00:58:02.697 --> 00:58:08.723]  In fact, you speak out and have your own ideas, and even if you're a nerd, you're still entertaining because you're real.
[00:58:08.723 --> 00:58:10.525]  Well, what do they say in Wayne's World?
[00:58:12.569 --> 00:58:13.690]  We're not worthy!
[00:58:13.690 --> 00:58:14.470]  We're not worthy!
[00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:17.952]  Every day when I cover these huge topics, I don't feel worthy to talk to you.
[00:58:17.952 --> 00:58:20.433]  Because these topics are so huge, they're so real.
[00:58:20.433 --> 00:58:21.834]  But I'm trying to tell you the truth.
[00:58:21.834 --> 00:58:23.875]  I'm trying to get it right, and most of the time we do.
[00:58:23.875 --> 00:58:25.555]  The globalists love lying to you.
[00:58:25.555 --> 00:58:26.876]  They love manipulating you.
[00:58:26.876 --> 00:58:29.597]  They enjoy destroying humanity.
[00:58:29.597 --> 00:58:34.199]  They enjoy manipulating ideas and using people's ignorance against them.
[00:58:34.199 --> 00:58:36.560]  That for me is really satanic.
[00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:37.641]  And disgusting.
[00:58:37.641 --> 00:58:39.942]  So you've got to pledge for myself and the whole InfoWars crew
[00:58:41.580 --> 00:58:43.441]  We will never join the globalists.
[00:58:43.441 --> 00:58:48.283]  We will never knowingly manipulate you because we know we're all in this together.
[00:58:48.283 --> 00:58:56.426]  Agenda 21 and Agenda 2030 are all about making you dependent and cutting you off from energy, food, and medicine.
[00:58:56.426 --> 00:59:05.090]  And with the blackouts we've seen that are guaranteed to be engineered to bring in federal and globalist control, we have seen massive lines of people
[00:59:06.161 --> 00:59:14.109]  Lined up at a few grocery stores and restaurants that were open and most of them getting turned away after hours of freezing in the cold.
[00:59:14.109 --> 00:59:19.914]  We've seen millions of people sleeping in their cars because they don't have any power in their house and then running out of gas.
[00:59:19.914 --> 00:59:21.856]  Ladies and gentlemen, energy is king.
[00:59:22.296 --> 00:59:25.699]  And food is the energy our bodies run off of, and water as well.

[00:59:46.314 --> 00:59:47.695]  Big discounts for only a few more days.
[00:59:51.486 --> 00:59:54.100]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:57.276 --> 01:00:23.474]  For those trapped in the frozen bureaucratic hell in Texas known as the 2021 Winter Storm, a world where the leadership failed beyond imagination, the largest lesson learned from those that endured the experience is that if they can't manage a full-scale natural and energy disaster, what makes anyone think that they can manage our lives with their Build Back Better Great Reset Takeover of all human existence?
[01:00:23.474 --> 01:00:24.975]  Build back better than before.
[01:00:24.975 --> 01:00:26.095]  Build back better.
[01:00:26.095 --> 01:00:26.416]  Build.
[01:00:30.493 --> 01:00:32.675]  I've talked to some folks down in Austin.
[01:00:53.709 --> 01:01:02.474]  Who, their frustration about it is, they're not getting any information about, okay, when is restoration coming?
[01:01:02.474 --> 01:01:03.735]  What is the situation?
[01:01:03.735 --> 01:01:12.440]  It seems as if residents have a grasp of the power situation, but people feel they don't have a grasp on the water situation.
[01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:13.401]  What can you do?
[01:01:13.401 --> 01:01:20.105]  We don't have any good answers because we can't give people an exact time when the water's going to be able to come back.
[01:01:20.105 --> 01:01:22.066]  What's the situation in Austin right now?
[01:01:22.706 --> 01:01:25.770]  It's pretty dire in the city right now.
[01:01:25.770 --> 01:01:29.854]  Somebody needs to explain what it is that happened here.
[01:01:29.854 --> 01:01:37.322]  While Senator Ted Cruz and Governor Abbott revealed a disconnect, few expected, realizing zero on the ground initiative.
[01:01:38.812 --> 01:01:41.612]  has been hell for the state of Texas.
[01:01:41.612 --> 01:01:44.213]  It has been two storms on top of each other.
[01:01:44.213 --> 01:01:45.993]  Four million Texans lost power.
[01:01:45.993 --> 01:01:48.714]  No power, no lights, many with no water.
[01:01:48.714 --> 01:01:50.234]  It has been frustrating.
[01:01:50.234 --> 01:01:53.955]  I'll tell you, Sean, a lot of Texans are mad or pissed off.
[01:01:53.955 --> 01:02:00.276]  And so last night I flew down with them to the beach and then I flew back this afternoon.
[01:02:00.276 --> 01:02:04.316]  I'd initially planned to stay through the weekend and to work remotely there.
[01:02:04.316 --> 01:02:07.377]  And I want to let you know what these experts told us.
[01:02:07.377 --> 01:02:07.877]  They said
[01:02:08.706 --> 01:02:18.133]  Five days before the winter storm hit, ERCOT assured that, quote, we are ready for the cold temperatures coming our way.
[01:02:18.133 --> 01:02:25.378]  They also said that ERCOT had issued a notice to power plants to ensure that they were winterized properly.
[01:02:25.378 --> 01:02:35.926]  And ERCOT's annual winter assessment, which was designed to ensure the state is prepared, that assessment assured the public of Texas
[01:02:36.607 --> 01:02:39.489]  Meanwhile, as the streets and temperatures remained frozen...
[01:02:58.456 --> 01:03:01.318]  All right, this is one of Bound's longer reports.
[01:03:01.318 --> 01:03:02.579]  It's about seven minutes long.
[01:03:02.579 --> 01:03:03.660]  It's at band.video.
[01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:04.681]  I suggest you share it.
[01:03:04.681 --> 01:03:07.624]  It gets really powerful and explains what's really behind this.
[01:03:07.624 --> 01:03:10.966]  It's darkwinterhell at band.video.
[01:03:10.966 --> 01:03:16.371]  Click the left-hand corner and just find the John Bound area and you'll find those reports.
[01:03:16.371 --> 01:03:21.135]  And again, this is one of the shows where I over-prepared.
[01:03:21.135 --> 01:03:25.779]  I've just, and my wife understands now, I just basically work all the time now.
[01:03:25.779 --> 01:03:27.060]  I'm not complaining.
[01:03:27.060 --> 01:03:27.340]  I just
[01:03:28.405 --> 01:03:37.887]  But then I get up here and I'm already so angry and so frustrated and I've already read so much of this that I just feel like I'm not doing a good job constantly and I'm mad at myself.
[01:03:37.887 --> 01:03:40.848]  Then I project that on the crew, on air and off air.
[01:03:40.848 --> 01:03:42.568]  I'm a jerk, so I apologize for being a jerk.
[01:03:42.568 --> 01:03:46.589]  But at a certain point too, ladies and gentlemen, most people would run and hide.
[01:03:46.589 --> 01:03:47.349]  Okay, and I get it.
[01:03:47.349 --> 01:03:48.789]  The public keeps running and hiding.
[01:03:48.789 --> 01:03:49.910]  My crew isn't running and hiding.
[01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:51.250]  You're not running and hiding.
[01:03:51.250 --> 01:03:54.671]  We just have to start putting heat on these people legally and lawfully.
[01:03:54.671 --> 01:03:56.131]  But I want to start getting some
[01:03:57.617 --> 01:03:58.457]  We're good to go.
[01:04:18.047 --> 01:04:21.808]  And so Gates is right that technically it's because the gas plants failed.
[01:04:21.808 --> 01:04:23.029]  That was the final reason.
[01:04:23.029 --> 01:04:25.869]  Because we get most of our damn power from natural gas.
[01:04:25.869 --> 01:04:27.730]  Because it's what's plentiful and cheap.
[01:04:27.730 --> 01:04:30.011]  It just doesn't work as good.
[01:04:30.011 --> 01:04:32.411]  It'll cook your eggs.
[01:04:32.411 --> 01:04:34.272]  It'll make a nice fireplace for you.
[01:04:34.272 --> 01:04:39.633]  But it doesn't explode in an engine right to drive pistons or turn a fricking turbine.
[01:04:39.633 --> 01:04:42.114]  And it sure as hell doesn't work in the cold.
[01:04:42.114 --> 01:04:44.715]  Only diesel and gasoline powers through it.
[01:04:46.718 --> 01:04:48.139]  I think the Germans have diesel!
[01:04:48.139 --> 01:04:49.621]  It's even better than gas!
[01:04:49.621 --> 01:04:51.182]  But damn cold!
[01:04:51.182 --> 01:04:52.943]  The other stuff doesn't work!
[01:04:52.943 --> 01:04:57.027]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:57.027 --> 01:05:12.981]  Finally, we're seeing major state governments in the United States running TV and radio ads saying, everybody, take your vitamin D3, take your zinc, and take your C. It's essential for your body's cells to maintain your health.
[01:05:12.981 --> 01:05:14.322]  Essential means you must have it.
[01:05:14.861 --> 01:05:17.402]  It's been sold out for months.
[01:05:17.402 --> 01:05:18.782]  It's Winter Sun.
[01:05:18.782 --> 01:05:24.364]  It's back in stock with Vitamin K. Both are essential for your immune system and for your body.
[01:05:24.364 --> 01:05:27.005]  We got a limited shipment in.

[01:06:07.404 --> 01:06:12.285]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:06:12.285 --> 01:06:14.826]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:14.826 --> 01:06:16.846]  Well, radio listeners can find the video.
[01:06:16.846 --> 01:06:20.967]  It's posted at band.video and newswars.com and infowars.com.
[01:06:20.967 --> 01:06:26.488]  TV viewers on a lot of radio, a lot of TV stations, a lot of cable stations out there can see it.
[01:06:26.488 --> 01:06:28.508]  But I had an idea for a video meme.
[01:06:28.508 --> 01:06:29.449]  It's only a minute long.
[01:06:29.449 --> 01:06:31.249]  Greg Reese did a great job voicing it.
[01:06:31.249 --> 01:06:33.349]  One of our great researchers here.
[01:06:33.349 --> 01:06:36.410]  And it's simply, America is running on one engine.
[01:06:37.168 --> 01:06:40.149]  He had that big passenger liner coming in.
[01:06:40.149 --> 01:06:42.390]  I guess it was United.
[01:06:42.390 --> 01:06:44.992]  One of the engines caught on fire, blew up.
[01:06:44.992 --> 01:06:49.954]  Dramatic footage of the fuel, the jet fuel, the kerosene, spilling into the engine.
[01:06:49.954 --> 01:06:54.356]  They were able to land it safely.
[01:06:54.356 --> 01:06:56.877]  America is operating on one engine right now.
[01:06:56.877 --> 01:06:58.278]  We have people that are awake.
[01:06:58.278 --> 01:06:59.599]  We have the states.
[01:06:59.599 --> 01:07:02.220]  We have some conservative, nationalistic, populist courts.
[01:07:02.220 --> 01:07:04.521]  But that engine's starting to smoke.
[01:07:05.416 --> 01:07:08.298]  And now Joe Biden's cutting the power off to it.
[01:07:08.298 --> 01:07:18.365]  And so, when I saw that engine on fire like that, there's a reason you want your plane to have two engines, whether it's a prop plane or whether it's a jet engine.
[01:07:18.365 --> 01:07:24.990]  And, you know, smarter folks, you know, have three engines, one up the top, two on the sides, or, you know, four engines or six engines.
[01:07:24.990 --> 01:07:32.255]  Not like an 18-wheeler's got more tires, because, you know, when you have a blowout, you don't die every time when you're going 75 miles an hour down the highway with a big load.
[01:07:33.021 --> 01:07:34.782]  With great power comes great responsibility.
[01:07:34.782 --> 01:07:35.702]  Better have more wheels.
[01:07:35.702 --> 01:07:36.903]  Better have more engines.
[01:07:36.903 --> 01:07:44.647]  But just the allegory of that burning engine of your radio listener, just have that in mind while Gregg Reese lays it out.
[01:07:47.358 --> 01:07:55.542]  The image of this airplane's engine burning in flight is quite the allegory for this very moment in time for the United States of America.
[01:07:55.542 --> 01:08:04.345]  After his first month as president, Joe Biden has canceled the Keystone Pipeline, terminating thousands of jobs and raising fuel prices.
[01:08:04.345 --> 01:08:09.708]  Suspended protection of our bulk power grid, which has already been infiltrated by the CCP.
[01:08:10.428 --> 01:08:18.535]  Nodded presidential support for the CCP's strong arming of Hong Kong, Chinese death camps, and the Uyghur genocide.
[01:08:18.535 --> 01:08:22.379]  Rejoined the Paris Climate Accord to further destroy U.S.
[01:08:22.379 --> 01:08:26.302]  industry while China's industry burns at full throttle.
[01:08:26.302 --> 01:08:31.326]  And rejoined the CCP-run World Health Organization, pushing the COVID-19 hoax.
[01:08:32.651 --> 01:08:36.432]  The federal government has completely fallen to the CCP.
[01:08:36.432 --> 01:08:39.152]  America has lost one of its engines.
[01:08:39.152 --> 01:08:47.374]  It is now up to our one remaining engine, the states, to pull us up before we crash, or at the very least, give us a good landing.
[01:08:47.374 --> 01:08:51.655]  And I wrote that, so that's not his words.
[01:08:51.655 --> 01:08:57.596]  I should have said, God is our remaining engine, and we've got to
[01:08:58.354 --> 01:09:07.918]  Call out to God to get ourselves politically active, to lead God and direct us, and then reach out to the legislatures, local communities, our churches that aren't completely controlled.
[01:09:07.918 --> 01:09:09.078]  And say no to this.
[01:09:09.078 --> 01:09:12.619]  I mean, this is out of control.
[01:09:12.619 --> 01:09:24.524]  And if you look at a report Greg Reese and I put out two weeks ago, long before this storm hit, we said next we'll be rolling blackouts and power shortages around the country because of regulations Joe Biden's putting in.
[01:09:24.524 --> 01:09:26.085]  And that's the formula.
[01:09:26.085 --> 01:09:27.005]  And that's what happened.
[01:09:27.805 --> 01:09:30.047]  These psychos act the same over and over again.
[01:09:30.047 --> 01:09:32.268]  It's why people are like, God, Jones, you're so smart.
[01:09:32.268 --> 01:09:33.209]  Your guests are so smart.
[01:09:33.209 --> 01:09:35.871]  How do you know this?
[01:09:35.871 --> 01:09:43.957]  How do cops, how do detectives that have been following a serial killer for 10, 15, 20 years finally catching on the scene when he's killing somebody?
[01:09:43.957 --> 01:09:48.740]  Because they've been tracking them for 20 years, folks, and they start to see patterns.
[01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:50.422]  And it's the same thing with these globalists.
[01:09:50.422 --> 01:09:52.283]  And then they write books and white papers
[01:09:53.092 --> 01:09:54.894]  Admitting they're shutting off the U.S.
[01:09:54.894 --> 01:10:01.499]  to teach us political control, to teach us how to be poor, and to make us be dependent on the state so they can make us become globalist.
[01:10:01.499 --> 01:10:05.982]  They admit they want to confiscate all your semi-automatics, including hunting shotguns!
[01:10:05.982 --> 01:10:09.365]  It's all being announced!
[01:10:09.365 --> 01:10:12.988]  And so I'm sorry it's dystopic.
[01:10:12.988 --> 01:10:15.090]  But only admitting how much trouble we're in is going to fix it.
[01:10:15.090 --> 01:10:17.932]  Now, they're just now finishing the report.
[01:10:17.932 --> 01:10:19.353]  It ends up it's 20 minutes long.
[01:10:19.353 --> 01:10:20.454]  That'll be the last two segments.
[01:10:21.266 --> 01:10:22.407]  And they're racing to get it done.
[01:10:22.407 --> 01:10:24.949]  It's got so much documentation on it.
[01:10:24.949 --> 01:10:26.971]  I just hope it's ready for the show today.
[01:10:26.971 --> 01:10:30.914]  But man, I'm telling you, we have cracked the case.
[01:10:30.914 --> 01:10:36.018]  It's come out that the Democrats in the deep state ran the Capitol attack.
[01:10:36.018 --> 01:10:43.944]  They were able to manipulate and provocateur through Q, not the Q shaman himself, but the Q priest.
[01:10:43.944 --> 01:10:46.266]  These Q drops were put out on 8chan.
[01:10:46.266 --> 01:10:50.810]  And then the people were manipulated to believing that it was actually Trump
[01:10:51.445 --> 01:10:59.071]  And so we now know that it was Antifa, the Southern Poverty Law Center, trained groups and others in control of the H.E.M.
[01:10:59.071 --> 01:11:01.012]  operation that did this.
[01:11:01.012 --> 01:11:04.215]  And it's just unbelievable.
[01:11:04.215 --> 01:11:06.817]  And of course, now people are like, oh, Jones, don't worry about it.
[01:11:06.817 --> 01:11:07.177]  Oh, really?
[01:11:07.177 --> 01:11:13.061]  It's in like a thousand publications that they want the FBI to have me indicted for saying I ran the attack on the Capitol.
[01:11:13.061 --> 01:11:15.303]  Just absolutely perfect.
[01:11:15.303 --> 01:11:17.184]  And this has all just come together in the last few days.
[01:11:17.184 --> 01:11:20.387]  CNN was paying the main guy that led it, along with what, NBC?
[01:11:22.228 --> 01:11:29.418]  Of course, Lindsey Graham, I was talking to folks very close to Trump, and Trump was getting ready to go on the offense and give a speech.
[01:11:29.418 --> 01:11:36.869]  Not just at CPAC, but I was told Trump was getting ready to speak about what Lindsey Graham told him that Pelosi did know, the Democrats were involved.
[01:11:36.869 --> 01:11:37.971]  This is all getting ready to come out.
[01:11:38.661 --> 01:11:45.306]  And so now as soon as Trump was found not guilty, they moved on to Alex Jones and Roger Stone.
[01:11:45.306 --> 01:11:53.893]  And so when I tell you I'm on the inside of this thing, I'm on the inside of being set up and then trying to send me to prison.
[01:11:53.893 --> 01:11:57.876]  But we found out very quickly what they were doing and tried to stop what happened at the Capitol.
[01:11:57.876 --> 01:12:00.058]  We definitely were able to mitigate what happened.
[01:12:00.058 --> 01:12:06.163]  But that is all coming up at the bottom of the hour, 33 after we come out of that break.
[01:12:06.843 --> 01:12:07.643]  We're going to premiere.
[01:12:07.643 --> 01:12:09.184]  It's not even going to be on Bandot Video yet.
[01:12:09.184 --> 01:12:11.745]  Hopefully soon after, so you can share it.
[01:12:11.745 --> 01:12:21.208]  The fact that Democrats admit to staging and launching the January 6th Capitol attack.
[01:12:21.208 --> 01:12:22.308]  They called it an insurrection.
[01:12:22.308 --> 01:12:23.368]  It was a dud.
[01:12:23.368 --> 01:12:24.649]  It failed.
[01:12:24.649 --> 01:12:31.171]  They fooled enough Q people, former high-level FBI, former high-level military, to actually believe they were working for Trump.
[01:12:31.171 --> 01:12:32.371]  That's why they were there with zip ties.
[01:12:32.371 --> 01:12:33.932]  They were like, where's the special forces?
[01:12:34.710 --> 01:12:35.730]  Where's the people?
[01:12:35.730 --> 01:12:37.111]  We're here to arrest Pelosi!
[01:12:37.111 --> 01:12:38.511]  Trump's coming!
[01:12:38.511 --> 01:12:50.355]  So they tricked Trump to say, go have an event, go have a peaceful protest, a march to the Capitol, then they shut up to the queue operators, well-meaning people believing that they were actually going
[01:12:51.457 --> 01:12:54.019]  to save the country with Trump in a violent overthrow.
[01:12:54.019 --> 01:12:55.600]  And then they kept the PR going.
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:57.521]  Oh, it's going to happen on the 20th.
[01:12:57.521 --> 01:13:00.043]  You know, Biden will be executed on the stage.
[01:13:00.043 --> 01:13:01.804]  I'm like, it's not true.
[01:13:01.804 --> 01:13:02.605]  It's a lie.
[01:13:02.605 --> 01:13:03.985]  It's a setup by them.
[01:13:03.985 --> 01:13:06.067]  They want permanent troops.
[01:13:06.067 --> 01:13:20.757]  And thank God we were able to snafu a whole bunch of their operatives that they had infiltrated in the Boogaloos, the Oath Keepers, and in the Proud Boys, which are not bad organizations, the Oath Keepers and the
[01:13:23.593 --> 01:13:39.045]  And the Proud Boys, and the Boogaloo's aren't even bad people on average, but even though they admit they take Antifa in and Antifa's now using them, but that's the groups they use through those groups online to tell them they were part of this big overthrow and that it was all magic and it was all this great moment with Trump.
[01:13:39.045 --> 01:13:48.432]  And so they got just like six people from Oath Keepers, three or four from the Proud Boys to go in after Antifa broke through
[01:13:49.361 --> 01:13:52.283]  And to go into the Capitol and the Q people were all swaggering.
[01:13:52.283 --> 01:13:54.764]  Hell, Trump's about to be here, you're all going to prison.
[01:13:54.764 --> 01:13:58.726]  You know, they said a prayer at the dais, they walked between the velvet ropes.
[01:13:58.726 --> 01:14:01.688]  Maybe 20 people were violent.
[01:14:01.688 --> 01:14:03.769]  And they were like, hey, we're here with Trump!
[01:14:03.769 --> 01:14:08.131]  It's alright, cops are on your side, we're about to... And so the media didn't know how to spin it.
[01:14:08.131 --> 01:14:09.672]  First they're like, oh yeah, it was all pre-planned.
[01:14:09.672 --> 01:14:12.934]  They go, wait a minute, we're blaming Trump saying he incited it.
[01:14:12.934 --> 01:14:16.256]  So then when he wasn't convicted of that, which Trump had no idea what was going on, he was set up like I was.
[01:14:17.153 --> 01:14:22.899]  Then they had to shift gears and, okay, it is a pre-planned group, and it's Alex Jones and Roger Stone.
[01:14:22.899 --> 01:14:24.020]  You got a problem.
[01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:27.223]  You ran your fat mouths in the Time Magazine article.
[01:14:27.223 --> 01:14:30.266]  And then we caught your people on tape admitting they did it.
[01:14:30.266 --> 01:14:33.089]  So get ready, get ready, get ready.
[01:14:33.089 --> 01:14:36.111]  Throw me in that briar patch.
[01:14:36.111 --> 01:14:39.615]  Because it's all coming out, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:14:41.070 --> 01:14:46.132]  It's just like in Arlington Road how they set up Jeff Bridges' character to be there when the bomb goes off.
[01:14:46.132 --> 01:14:50.594]  He's there thinking he's stopping the bomb, but he ends up being lured to the site to be blamed for it.
[01:14:50.594 --> 01:14:51.754]  That's how these groups operate.
[01:14:51.754 --> 01:14:53.515]  It's very sophisticated.
[01:14:53.515 --> 01:14:55.856]  But here's the problem with complex plans.
[01:14:55.856 --> 01:14:57.257]  They often go astray.
[01:14:57.257 --> 01:15:00.358]  The best laid plans of mice and men often go astray.
[01:15:00.358 --> 01:15:01.719]  And that is exactly what happened here.
[01:15:01.719 --> 01:15:02.719]  It was supposed to be big.
[01:15:02.719 --> 01:15:04.240]  It was supposed to be a shootout.
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:05.960]  It was supposed to be arresting Pelosi.
[01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:09.002]  It was supposed to go engage the Capitol Police.
[01:15:09.002 --> 01:15:09.902]  And then notice now,
[01:15:10.638 --> 01:15:13.820]  General Honore blamed the Capitol Police.
[01:15:13.820 --> 01:15:16.202]  That's the one part I forgot to put in my report.
[01:15:16.202 --> 01:15:18.603]  General Honore's like, they're all white supremacists.
[01:15:18.603 --> 01:15:21.485]  They were in on it.
[01:15:21.485 --> 01:15:22.266]  Can you believe that?
[01:15:22.266 --> 01:15:24.447]  Because they know they were ordered to stand down.
[01:15:24.447 --> 01:15:27.209]  Pelosi got a report two weeks before, a week before, the day before.
[01:15:28.385 --> 01:15:30.626]  We want to have the purge, the military and police.
[01:15:30.626 --> 01:15:33.267]  So, Honoré probably was in charge of all this.
[01:15:33.267 --> 01:15:36.528]  That's what the research points at with the Southern Property Law Center, CIA and others.
[01:15:36.528 --> 01:15:38.049]  That's the groups that run this, that are connected.
[01:15:38.049 --> 01:15:40.409]  CNN, heavily involved, said that day one.
[01:15:40.409 --> 01:15:44.471]  Now we know they paid the main commander that went in with the CNN reporters embedded.
[01:15:44.471 --> 01:15:49.673]  And that's why Honoré doesn't want to get in trouble himself, so he's blaming the police.
[01:15:49.673 --> 01:15:50.333]  What a traitor!
[01:15:50.333 --> 01:15:51.773]  What a sack of filth!
[01:15:51.773 --> 01:15:52.394]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:52.394 --> 01:15:52.754]  Stay with us.
[01:15:56.108 --> 01:16:01.230]  The need for storable foods are increasingly apparent.
[01:16:01.230 --> 01:16:11.554]  With millions left without power, including most grocery stores, many Texas residents are left without food.
[01:16:11.554 --> 01:16:18.577]  The lines at the grocery stores are getting longer and longer, while most of the store shelves are left bare.
[01:16:19.790 --> 01:16:32.940]  Now we know that in the most historic record freezing temperatures in over a century, your government can simply turn off the power, turn off the heat, and turn off the water.
[01:16:34.642 --> 01:16:40.026]  Don't let your government dictate whether or not you're able to feed your family.
[01:16:40.026 --> 01:16:51.074]  Go to infowarrestore.com and get at least a year's supply of storable foods to make sure you and your family are prepared for the unimaginable.
[01:16:51.074 --> 01:16:53.636]  Get your storable foods at infowarrestore.com.
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:17:04.627]  As negative as times are right now, and as depressing as things can be, you have to understand that this is all a test.
[01:17:04.627 --> 01:17:10.672]  This experience, this life on this planet, is a reckoning.
[01:17:10.672 --> 01:17:19.559]  It's God giving us a chance to work things out in the third dimension, so we can decide where we want to spend eternity, and what level we want to go to.
[01:17:19.559 --> 01:17:20.800]  And it really does come down to that.
[01:17:22.003 --> 01:17:29.390]  As sad as things are and as evil as things are, look at all the good in the world as well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness.
[01:17:29.390 --> 01:17:33.013]  God is the author of us having our own will.
[01:17:33.013 --> 01:17:35.956]  God is the author of us having free will.
[01:17:35.956 --> 01:17:38.619]  And that free will is a beautiful thing.
[01:17:39.198 --> 01:17:43.542]  And when you look at mainstream media in Hollywood and this whole evil culture, and Washington D.C.
[01:17:43.542 --> 01:17:48.667]  and Fauci and the mass cult, it's all about dominating your free will.
[01:17:48.667 --> 01:17:51.450]  It's all about telling you you're dirty, you're ugly, you're in the bad.
[01:17:51.450 --> 01:17:55.454]  Because Satan hates you because you're made in the image of God, the creator of the universe.
[01:17:56.491 --> 01:18:04.956]  We here at InfoWars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava Root Supplement that is now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:18:04.956 --> 01:18:15.502]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today, though it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and euphoric effects.
[01:18:15.502 --> 01:18:25.147]  According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa, who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[01:18:25.487 --> 01:18:31.448]  The Samoan people would drink kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little.
[01:18:31.448 --> 01:18:36.309]  Nowadays, kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[01:18:36.309 --> 01:18:48.652]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only kava kava, but other herbs including, but not limited to, German chamomile, organic skullcap, and valerian roots.
[01:18:48.992 --> 01:18:57.035]  We do expect to sell this new product quickly, so be sure to secure yours by visiting InfowarsStore.com.
[01:18:57.035 --> 01:19:00.076]  My enemies are your enemies.
[01:19:00.076 --> 01:19:00.776]  They're the globalists.
[01:19:00.776 --> 01:19:02.337]  They're the exterminists.
[01:19:02.337 --> 01:19:18.142]  They're a consortium of mad scientists, pedophiles, control freaks, devil worshippers, vampires, whatever you want to call them, that are highly predatory and are setting up a false fantasy land system of constant bombardment of propaganda, drugs, and
[01:19:19.168 --> 01:19:31.171]  Electromagnetic radiation to change the very DNA of the human species to mutate us into a form that they can control like a pawn on a chessboard.
[01:19:31.171 --> 01:19:38.473]  The bottom line is they want to play God and they are playing God and the noose is only going to tighten around our necks from here on out.
[01:19:38.473 --> 01:19:40.354]  So many other people want to be positive.
[01:19:40.354 --> 01:19:45.115]  They want to put out fake news and want to only cover limited amounts of what's happening with the new world order but
[01:19:45.925 --> 01:19:59.451]  At the end of the day, it's all about the population, it's all about world government, it's all about the end of the human system as we know it, and all it's actually is a nightmare being built, only admitting it can turn it around and stop it.
[01:19:59.451 --> 01:20:02.052]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:17.833 --> 01:20:24.236]  You know, I don't blame folks who just want to go out.
[01:20:24.236 --> 01:20:26.437]  Forget this whole new world over exists.
[01:20:26.437 --> 01:20:29.659]  They're going to come for you on your farms.
[01:20:29.659 --> 01:20:31.420]  They're going to come for you on your ranches.
[01:20:31.420 --> 01:20:36.382]  They're going to come for you in your businesses and in your schools and your churches.
[01:20:36.382 --> 01:20:41.205]  They're going to come for you in your homes, in your gun safe, in your pocketbook.
[01:20:41.205 --> 01:20:42.546]  And they're not going to stop.
[01:20:42.546 --> 01:20:45.127]  They're going to come for you in your children's minds and souls.
[01:20:46.934 --> 01:20:53.879]  And so I worked yesterday and today on this report that they are transferring over right now to our computers that they just finished.
[01:20:53.879 --> 01:20:56.121]  Hopefully it'll be ready by the start of the next segment.
[01:20:56.121 --> 01:20:59.724]  It's about a 19-minute report, so it'll air here in the time we have left.
[01:20:59.724 --> 01:21:06.509]  But if it doesn't, it'll air during Sunday Live that Owen hosts, but even has half the commercials because we only do local commercials.
[01:21:07.713 --> 01:21:09.253]  I'm syndicated through GCN.
[01:21:09.253 --> 01:21:09.953]  I still love them.
[01:21:09.953 --> 01:21:13.494]  They're good guys, so I let them still have network ads.
[01:21:13.494 --> 01:21:19.335]  If I had my brothers, I'll be the first talk show host ever to get rid of network ads where the stations have all the ads and we have none.
[01:21:19.335 --> 01:21:25.076]  We just do a short plug each hour live on air, like all the other hosts do every segment.
[01:21:25.076 --> 01:21:26.816]  We do it about once an hour.
[01:21:26.816 --> 01:21:35.998]  But because that show's not syndicated over GCN, we're able to only give you six minutes of ads an hour, whereas we have the average for talk radio, 14 minutes.
[01:21:38.304 --> 01:21:40.745]  Regardless, it'll be posted to Bandot Video.
[01:21:40.745 --> 01:21:46.226]  It needs to go viral because the Democrats have confessed the stage of the Capitol attack.
[01:21:46.226 --> 01:21:48.147]  And I remember when it happened.
[01:21:48.147 --> 01:22:00.289]  I said, why is General Honore, the guy that did the gun complication in Katrina, on the news on January 6th saying the police are complicit and they're white supremacists?
[01:22:00.289 --> 01:22:06.251]  I mean, the Capitol Police are very professional, very politically correct, and about half of them are black.
[01:22:08.061 --> 01:22:09.963]  I mean, that's just crazy.
[01:22:09.963 --> 01:22:11.664]  They were told to go do traffic control.
[01:22:11.664 --> 01:22:12.846]  They had half their regular number.
[01:22:12.846 --> 01:22:16.809]  The city of D.C., the district, is in control of them.
[01:22:16.809 --> 01:22:17.470]  That ought to change.
[01:22:17.470 --> 01:22:20.372]  I think the feds ought to have their own police there.
[01:22:20.372 --> 01:22:25.457]  And a couple hundred people were able to break in.
[01:22:25.457 --> 01:22:26.558]  And the police showed restraint.
[01:22:26.558 --> 01:22:31.963]  And then when other people came in, once the crowd started coming in, because they didn't know what just happened a hundred yards in front of them.
[01:22:31.963 --> 01:22:32.804]  I didn't know what was going on.
[01:22:32.804 --> 01:22:33.705]  I was 300 yards back.
[01:22:35.618 --> 01:22:44.084]  Then once there's hundreds more coming in, okay, the cops shook hands, took selfies, and those people stayed within the velvet ropes.
[01:22:44.084 --> 01:22:50.248]  We've got all this other big news here, folks, but there's 30,000 National Guard troops stationed there basically permanently.
[01:22:50.248 --> 01:22:53.050]  Biden says the mask never comes off even if he had the vaccine.
[01:22:53.050 --> 01:22:55.852]  He said that Friday at Pfizer.
[01:22:55.852 --> 01:22:57.633]  This is a serious takeover.
[01:22:57.633 --> 01:22:58.934]  This is martial law.
[01:22:58.934 --> 01:23:02.557]  When you're wearing a face diaper, keep your piehole shut, you're in a tyranny.
[01:23:02.557 --> 01:23:04.018]  You're in a science fiction movie, brother.
[01:23:04.628 --> 01:23:07.970]  We're not allowed to criticize it online, or you'll get banned.
[01:23:07.970 --> 01:23:10.651]  Even if you're a medical doctor, you're not in a free country anymore.
[01:23:10.651 --> 01:23:14.853]  And they're mopping up the final oases.
[01:23:14.853 --> 01:23:17.054]  The final watering holes of truth.
[01:23:17.054 --> 01:23:20.955]  And InfoWars is one of the biggest, last standing organizations.
[01:23:20.955 --> 01:23:23.296]  It's been a great honor to serve with all of you here.
[01:23:23.296 --> 01:23:24.397]  Today could be our last show.
[01:23:24.397 --> 01:23:25.657]  Next week, next month.
[01:23:25.657 --> 01:23:30.579]  But there's a quickening happening, where more people are listening than ever have before.
[01:23:30.579 --> 01:23:31.660]  And it's magic what's going on.
[01:23:33.042 --> 01:23:34.222]  I don't care about Hollywood.
[01:23:34.222 --> 01:23:35.964]  I don't care about being part of the power structure.
[01:23:35.964 --> 01:23:37.565]  I don't live in LA or New York.
[01:23:37.565 --> 01:23:40.147]  I don't try to be close to the power.
[01:23:40.147 --> 01:23:44.470]  But the people that aren't part of the power structure, but that are popular, they love my show.
[01:23:44.470 --> 01:23:46.792]  I think my show is unwatchable half the time.
[01:23:46.792 --> 01:23:49.674]  But the biggest names out there love my show.
[01:23:49.674 --> 01:23:51.916]  I know Rush Limbaugh, I was told, listened every night.
[01:23:52.811 --> 01:23:55.293]  I know Matt Drudge listens basically 24-7.
[01:23:55.293 --> 01:23:59.577]  I know that other people, the big guy on Fox is a big listener and a big viewer.
[01:23:59.577 --> 01:24:00.137]  I'll leave it at that.
[01:24:00.137 --> 01:24:02.299]  I talked to him just the other day.
[01:24:02.299 --> 01:24:04.040]  And it goes on and on.
[01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:06.722]  Steven Crowder, the list goes on and on.
[01:24:06.722 --> 01:24:09.444]  But listen, that's not a power trip for me.
[01:24:09.444 --> 01:24:11.266]  That is a great honor.
[01:24:11.266 --> 01:24:17.131]  And it shows, and I'm only giving a report card to you, the boss, the listeners, the providers, the ones that keep us on air.
[01:24:17.131 --> 01:24:18.311]  Thank you for what you've done.
[01:24:18.311 --> 01:24:20.093]  Because I'll be steadfast at the end.
[01:24:21.224 --> 01:24:22.324]  I just want to fight the globalists.
[01:24:22.324 --> 01:24:23.865]  I want to defeat them.
[01:24:23.865 --> 01:24:26.805]  I have an absolute commitment to stop them.
[01:24:26.805 --> 01:24:34.287]  But instead of it creating a power trip, I just feel terrible because we're not doing more to turn the tide, and I'm just very frustrated.
[01:24:34.287 --> 01:24:37.528]  But out of that frustration, I know we're going to get the victory we need.
[01:24:37.528 --> 01:24:38.248]  So let me show you this.
[01:24:38.248 --> 01:24:44.069]  Since I mentioned it, I don't want to just say something and then not show it to you, because this is the one thing I forgot in the report coming up.
[01:24:46.022 --> 01:24:58.970]  General Honoré, who's running the gun confiscation national threat assessment plan to go after the American people, who says we need to put millions of Trump people in prison, take our guns, put us on no-fly list, arrest members of Congress.
[01:24:58.970 --> 01:25:03.013]  I mean, this guy's like Hitler reborn or something!
[01:25:03.013 --> 01:25:06.255]  But I guess it's okay, because his great-great-great-great-grandfather was black.
[01:25:06.255 --> 01:25:10.818]  Again, he looks about as black as the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback.
[01:25:10.818 --> 01:25:11.979]  Tom Brady's racist!
[01:25:11.979 --> 01:25:12.439]  He beat him!
[01:25:13.281 --> 01:25:16.262]  It's like saying Elizabeth Warren is a Native American.
[01:25:16.262 --> 01:25:22.565]  The point is, General Honore wants your guns.
[01:25:22.565 --> 01:25:28.988]  We already showed you last hour how he ran the confiscation in Katrina, back many, many years ago.
[01:25:28.988 --> 01:25:31.689]  But now, look at this headline.
[01:25:32.876 --> 01:25:50.161]  Russell Honore, Pelosi's pick for Capitol Security Review, claimed police were complicit in the riot and six police are under criminal investigation because when a mob of people came up to one guy and wanted to take a photo, he doesn't know what's about to happen, so okay, I'll take a photo.
[01:25:50.161 --> 01:25:51.802]  They ordered the stand down.
[01:25:51.802 --> 01:25:53.463]  So how is the individual officer to blame?
[01:25:53.463 --> 01:25:54.363]  It's not true.
[01:25:54.363 --> 01:25:54.863]  It's a fraud.
[01:25:56.263 --> 01:25:58.885]  But see, Honore knows that Pelosi was warned.
[01:25:58.885 --> 01:26:01.287]  Honore knows Time Magazine bragged they knew it was coming.
[01:26:01.287 --> 01:26:02.228]  They know they infiltrated.
[01:26:02.228 --> 01:26:03.469]  He knows this!
[01:26:03.469 --> 01:26:05.671]  He's the type of guy probably in command of it!
[01:26:05.671 --> 01:26:08.253]  Hell, he ran gun confiscation in Katrina!
[01:26:08.253 --> 01:26:14.057]  He's an America-hating, gun-hating, God-hating sack of garbage!
[01:26:14.057 --> 01:26:17.260]  The general they want to lead the takedown of America!
[01:26:17.260 --> 01:26:20.582]  Ladies and gentlemen, you have met your Benedict Arnold!
[01:26:20.582 --> 01:26:22.544]  General Russell Honore!
[01:26:22.544 --> 01:26:23.685]  A disgusting joke!
[01:26:25.276 --> 01:26:27.097]  And here he is saying, the police?
[01:26:27.097 --> 01:26:30.679]  Remember he said, why?
[01:26:30.679 --> 01:26:36.062]  He goes up to 30% of the Capitol police are white!
[01:26:36.062 --> 01:26:43.406]  It's like Cartoon Network has a PSA telling children to seek color and to become anti-racist preachers and that whites shouldn't exist!
[01:26:45.968 --> 01:26:49.990]  Man, I mean, this is sick Civil War garbage, folks.
[01:26:49.990 --> 01:26:51.070]  So he wants me arrested?
[01:26:51.070 --> 01:26:52.371]  I bet he does!
[01:26:52.371 --> 01:26:54.412]  I don't care, you piece of filth!
[01:26:54.412 --> 01:26:58.254]  You're the one that needs to be arrested for gun confiscation in Katrina, you monster!
[01:26:58.254 --> 01:27:02.556]  Why don't you stop Obama's sex trafficking of kids that just started back up on the border?
[01:27:02.556 --> 01:27:04.797]  That's in the Senate report, you little monster!
[01:27:04.797 --> 01:27:05.377]  Walk around with your...
[01:27:05.677 --> 01:27:09.820]  You got your beret on, your glasses, your cigar, like you're George Patton.
[01:27:09.820 --> 01:27:11.702]  You didn't go up against the Nazis.
[01:27:11.702 --> 01:27:17.967]  You went up against the American people and took their guns when they were freezing in their houses, you traitor, you enemy.
[01:27:17.967 --> 01:27:20.329]  There's another enemy.
[01:27:20.329 --> 01:27:24.913]  Our Islamic Lord and Chief, in his third term, dismantling the country.
[01:27:24.913 --> 01:27:27.415]  Now he's got an old shrunk man to do it.
[01:27:27.415 --> 01:27:28.756]  Barack Obama saying,
[01:27:30.554 --> 01:27:36.398]  In 2012, 2013, that he's going to get your coal, and going to turn your power off.
[01:27:36.398 --> 01:27:38.020]  And he did it, and that's why you're in the cold.
[01:27:38.020 --> 01:27:41.803]  Here it is.
[01:27:41.803 --> 01:27:44.865]  Let me sort of describe my overall policy.
[01:27:44.865 --> 01:27:53.592]  What I've said is that we would put a cap-and-trade system in place that is as aggressive, if not more aggressive, than anybody else's out there.
[01:27:53.592 --> 01:27:58.716]  I was the first to call for a 100% auction on the cap-and-trade system, which means that every
[01:27:59.628 --> 01:28:00.769]  We're good to go.
[01:28:24.062 --> 01:28:27.105]  So, if somebody wants to build a coal-powered plant, they can.
[01:28:27.105 --> 01:28:34.931]  It's just that it will bankrupt them because they're going to be charged a huge sum for all that greenhouse gas that's being emitted.
[01:28:36.079 --> 01:28:37.520]  And where does the money go?
[01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:41.202]  He actually owes the Chicago Mercantile Exchange part for carbon.
[01:28:41.202 --> 01:28:41.883]  That's right!
[01:28:41.883 --> 01:28:44.104]  The Clintons and Obama and the Rothschilds make the money!
[01:28:44.104 --> 01:28:49.007]  Oh, isn't that cutesy putsey?
[01:28:49.007 --> 01:28:50.628]  We'll be back with a big special report.
[01:28:50.628 --> 01:28:51.729]  We've cracked the case!
[01:28:51.729 --> 01:28:55.832]  The Democrats admit they launched the attack on the Capitol!
[01:28:55.832 --> 01:29:01.495]  The New World Order is a planetary corporate plan for world government.
[01:29:01.495 --> 01:29:04.157]  But world government is only the control grid.
[01:29:05.803 --> 01:29:12.288]  Inner members of the cult are told that they are going to transcend and become gods and attain immortality.
[01:29:12.288 --> 01:29:19.314]  But the price for that is to carry out the orderly extermination of all carbon-based life forms.
[01:29:19.314 --> 01:29:21.556]  That's why they say carbon is bad.
[01:29:21.556 --> 01:29:25.299]  They are rewriting the entire genetic code of the planet.
[01:29:25.299 --> 01:29:26.500]  They are playing God.
[01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:37.045]  They believe they have been inspired by interdimensional entities that are giving them advanced technology to carry out this transformation.
[01:29:37.045 --> 01:29:42.348]  I know this sounds insane, but if you read the writings of the Globalist, it's all on record.
[01:29:42.348 --> 01:29:44.769]  You have been warned.
[01:29:44.769 --> 01:29:49.252]  You have been given the information to say no to this plan.
[01:29:49.252 --> 01:29:52.814]  This is the end of all life on Earth as we know it.
[01:29:52.814 --> 01:29:55.275]  This is the alien takeover of Earth.
[01:29:56.354 --> 01:29:57.915]  Now is the time to get prepared.
[01:29:57.915 --> 01:30:02.538]  Now is the time to get high quality storable food that's ready to be shipped to you within days.

[01:30:57.526 --> 01:31:12.943]  The entire New World Order system is about making you feel pathetic, making you feel weak, making you play the part of a victim so you don't take your birthright as being made the image of God and the incredible mission and destiny we have, being given free will.
[01:31:12.943 --> 01:31:15.186]  Being given free will, being given consciousness.
[01:31:15.906 --> 01:31:21.110]  is literally the seed of an entire universe, an entire system.
[01:31:21.110 --> 01:31:37.762]  And the fact that you're able to commune with God, the fact that you're able to see the beauty of a sunset, or the beauty of the waves in the ocean, or the beauty of your wife or your husband, or the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty of music, the fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic.
[01:31:37.762 --> 01:31:41.205]  And that itself is what God teaches us is worship.
[01:31:41.805 --> 01:31:50.188]  So don't worship the globalists, don't worship the NFL, don't worship all the things of the system, but worship the things of God, because we're made by God.
[01:31:50.188 --> 01:31:54.510]  And appreciate your consciousness, and appreciate free speech, while you still have it.
[01:31:54.510 --> 01:31:56.451]  While you still have it.
[01:31:56.451 --> 01:31:59.632]  I've been thinking a lot lately about playing devil's advocate on air.
[01:32:00.902 --> 01:32:03.763]  About looking at the world from the perspective of the globalists.
[01:32:03.763 --> 01:32:12.787]  That the public's so dumbed down that they don't care that we're stealing their future from them, that we're poisoning them, that we're sterilizing them, that they deserve to be killed.
[01:32:12.787 --> 01:32:14.547]  Yes, that's the position of the globalists.
[01:32:14.547 --> 01:32:15.348]  They play God.
[01:32:15.348 --> 01:32:20.189]  And they think because we don't stand up, they have a right to do this to us.
[01:32:20.189 --> 01:32:23.051]  And I've told you that the globalists have tried to hire me.
[01:32:23.051 --> 01:32:24.471]  They've tried to get me to join them.
[01:32:24.471 --> 01:32:26.332]  But metaphysically, at a spiritual level,
[01:32:27.755 --> 01:32:28.695]  I have the Holy Spirit.
[01:32:28.695 --> 01:32:30.476]  I have connection with God.
[01:32:30.476 --> 01:32:33.957]  And I know that God does not like that, so I cannot join the enemy.
[01:32:33.957 --> 01:32:42.739]  But I'll tell you, at a selfish level, I get very, very mad at people that go along with the system, believing you're part of it, or believing you're getting power out of it.
[01:32:42.739 --> 01:32:48.641]  Whether you're just a steel worker, or a school teacher, or a Henry Kissinger, you're not God.
[01:32:48.641 --> 01:32:55.143]  And treating other people like they're animals, and you're God, is something that the real God of the universe doesn't like.
[01:32:55.143 --> 01:32:55.863]  And that's a fact.
[01:32:59.421 --> 01:33:09.810]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:09.810 --> 01:33:11.511]  Big Brother.
[01:33:11.511 --> 01:33:13.873]  Mainstream media.
[01:33:13.873 --> 01:33:15.635]  Government cover-ups.
[01:33:15.635 --> 01:33:17.696]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:33:17.696 --> 01:33:19.858]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:19.858 --> 01:33:24.422]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:25.208 --> 01:33:34.217]  Lieutenant General Russell Honore has been brought out of retirement by President Obama and Nancy Pelosi to prepare to prosecute war and gun confiscation nationwide.
[01:33:34.887 --> 01:33:46.775]  He is now saying that they have six police officers are suspended in the Capitol 35 under investigation, claiming they launched the attack on the Capitol when all evidence is the Democratic Party launched it.
[01:33:46.775 --> 01:33:48.536]  You're about to see that evidence.
[01:33:48.536 --> 01:33:51.177]  That's why Senator Graham said, what did Pelosi know?
[01:33:51.177 --> 01:33:51.838]  When did they know it?
[01:33:51.838 --> 01:33:55.520]  It's why they dropped the Trump trial a week early.
[01:33:55.520 --> 01:33:56.481]  We have to go public.
[01:33:56.481 --> 01:33:57.742]  We have to expose them.
[01:33:57.742 --> 01:34:00.423]  They're trying to frame us for the operation they launched.
[01:34:00.423 --> 01:34:01.444]  Here is the incredible proof.
[01:34:03.138 --> 01:34:05.320]  Mark your calendars, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:05.320 --> 01:34:09.383]  We now know who pre-planned the attack on the U.S.
[01:34:09.383 --> 01:34:11.285]  Capitol from their own words.
[01:34:11.285 --> 01:34:19.251]  Because again, criminals love to brag.
[01:34:19.251 --> 01:34:22.974]  I never thought I'd be in a real live episode of Magnum P.I.
[01:34:22.974 --> 01:34:23.695]  or Columbo.
[01:34:23.695 --> 01:34:26.718]  I guess Perry Mason comes to mind?
[01:34:26.718 --> 01:34:27.118]  But I am.
[01:34:28.507 --> 01:34:30.949]  National headlines everywhere the last two days.
[01:34:30.949 --> 01:34:40.395]  Alex Jones and Roger Stone under criminal investigation to see if we pre-planned the Capitol insurrection attack.
[01:34:40.395 --> 01:34:45.358]  Now let's unpack that here for just a moment and then I'm going to give you the big news.
[01:34:45.358 --> 01:34:57.145]  We actually know exactly who carried out the pre-planning of the Capitol attack on January 6th and we have it from their own words in print and on video and with audio.
[01:34:57.145 --> 01:34:57.986]  We're going to show you
[01:34:58.860 --> 01:35:04.625]  Who took credit and who got $70,000 from CNN and from NBC.
[01:35:04.625 --> 01:35:06.486]  So that's all coming up in a moment.
[01:35:06.486 --> 01:35:19.817]  But first let me briefly address the claim by the Washington Post and others that Roger Stone and myself are some of the chief suspects in the pre-planned attack on the Capitol.
[01:35:35.383 --> 01:35:39.494]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:35:40.686 --> 01:35:52.072]  We were told by all the Democratic leaders, by the entire corporate media, not just here but across the world, that President Trump summoned a mob of a million violent criminals to D.C.
[01:35:52.072 --> 01:35:54.073]  to illegally challenge a U.S.
[01:35:54.073 --> 01:35:54.513]  election.
[01:35:54.513 --> 01:35:55.974]  You're not supposed to do that.
[01:35:55.974 --> 01:35:58.995]  And that he then directed them to attack the Capitol.
[01:35:58.995 --> 01:36:02.317]  And all one million went in and ransacked and murdered people.
[01:36:02.317 --> 01:36:04.898]  And it was the most violent thing to happen on U.S.
[01:36:04.898 --> 01:36:06.339]  soil since Pearl Harbor.
[01:36:07.071 --> 01:36:09.193]  Chuckie Schumer and others called it Pearl Harbor.
[01:36:09.193 --> 01:36:11.075]  They compared it to World War II.
[01:36:11.075 --> 01:36:12.697]  They compared it to 9-11.
[01:36:12.697 --> 01:36:15.640]  And they said that, again, it was not premeditated.
[01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:24.289]  President Trump was the only one that premeditated it by getting that crowd there and then hyping them up as a rabble rouser to attack the building.
[01:36:24.289 --> 01:36:25.030]  But he was acquitted
[01:36:26.025 --> 01:36:29.487]  President Franklin Roosevelt set aside December 7th, 1941 as a day that will live in infamy.
[01:36:29.487 --> 01:36:31.188]  Unfortunately, we can now add January 6th, 2021
[01:36:55.723 --> 01:37:02.987]  To that very short list of dates in American history that will live forever in infamy.
[01:37:02.987 --> 01:37:07.589]  And please, show me where it says that protests are supposed to be polite and peaceful.
[01:37:07.589 --> 01:37:09.730]  People will do what they do.
[01:37:09.730 --> 01:37:13.152]  You're in the arena, you gotta be ready to take a punch.
[01:37:13.152 --> 01:37:15.193]  And you gotta be ready to throw a punch.
[01:37:15.193 --> 01:37:17.394]  There's hundreds of those clips, we all know them.
[01:37:17.394 --> 01:37:18.435]  And so they had to acquit him.
[01:37:19.292 --> 01:37:26.879]  And the ink wasn't dry on Trump's acquittal until they turned around and said, actually, it's Roger Stone and Alex Jones.
[01:37:26.879 --> 01:37:33.005]  They're the ones that captained and field-martialed this entire operation, and it was premeditated.
[01:37:33.005 --> 01:37:34.026]  My John Jr.
[01:37:34.026 --> 01:37:37.430]  said, we're not burning buildings down or shooting cops.
[01:37:37.430 --> 01:37:39.151]  We're building America up!
[01:37:39.151 --> 01:37:42.575]  We're here to take our rightful country back peacefully!
[01:37:43.502 --> 01:37:52.066]  You guys are great, but the police provocateurs have caused a problem, and the police are throwing flashbangs.
[01:37:52.066 --> 01:37:54.507]  We don't want to have a Kent State here.
[01:37:54.507 --> 01:37:57.068]  So let's get into the evidence right now.
[01:37:57.068 --> 01:38:06.473]  Coming up, I'm going to show you where the establishment Democrats bragged in Time Magazine just two weeks ago that they indeed set up Trump supporters on the 6th.
[01:38:06.473 --> 01:38:09.074]  But before we get to that piece of smoking gun evidence,
[01:38:09.776 --> 01:38:15.218]  Let's look at one of the main leaders of the insurrection at the Capitol.
[01:38:15.218 --> 01:38:18.039]  So how was how was this lady shot?
[01:38:18.039 --> 01:38:20.560]  I mean, she was in trying to get through the door.
[01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:25.321]  And it was a do you see who shot her?
[01:38:25.321 --> 01:38:28.242]  Yeah, so I was getting to that part.
[01:38:28.242 --> 01:38:30.483]  So immediately after they start breaking through the glass,
[01:38:30.908 --> 01:38:38.214]  Once they broke through the glass, they were using, like, flag poles and whatever they had to kind of bash through the windows.
[01:38:38.214 --> 01:38:43.439]  On the right-hand side, this lady was able to, like, make her way all the way through the window.
[01:38:43.439 --> 01:38:47.863]  All we see is these guns come out the doorways.
[01:38:47.863 --> 01:38:48.663]  Just guns.
[01:38:48.663 --> 01:38:50.545]  And all you can see is their hand.
[01:38:50.545 --> 01:38:50.845]  That's it.
[01:38:50.845 --> 01:38:51.726]  You can see faces.
[01:38:53.422 --> 01:38:57.704]  Right when I saw that, I was yelling to people, I was like, guys, there's guns, there's guns, you don't want to go through there.
[01:38:57.704 --> 01:39:00.326]  Like, they were going to shoot.
[01:39:00.326 --> 01:39:04.568]  Like, not just hold it there and run away, they were literally going to shoot to kill.
[01:39:04.568 --> 01:39:11.531]  The second that she climbed through the window, she got shot, like, right in the neck area, fell backwards.
[01:39:11.531 --> 01:39:14.433]  Meet John Sullivan, a.k.a.
[01:39:14.433 --> 01:39:17.534]  Jaden X. His father is a famous U.S.
[01:39:17.534 --> 01:39:18.235]  military general.
[01:39:18.892 --> 01:39:31.819]  On the morning of January 6th, Jaden X was recorded over and over and over again saying, we're gonna go to the Capitol and we're going to burn it down.
[01:39:31.819 --> 01:39:37.142]  But that didn't stop CNN from saying he was an innocent bystander and a journalist.
[01:39:37.142 --> 01:39:42.265]  And it didn't stop CNN and other news outlets from secretly paying him $70,000.
[01:39:42.265 --> 01:39:45.747]  That finally came out in court just last week.
[01:39:47.403 --> 01:39:48.363]  Give me your hug now.
[01:39:48.363 --> 01:39:49.584]  We did it!
[01:39:49.584 --> 01:39:51.684]  You were right!
[01:39:51.684 --> 01:39:52.784]  We did it!
[01:39:52.784 --> 01:39:54.905]  Dude, I was trying to tell you.
[01:39:54.905 --> 01:39:56.905]  I couldn't say much.
[01:39:56.905 --> 01:39:58.846]  You were right!
[01:39:58.846 --> 01:40:00.386]  You just have to watch my chat.
[01:40:00.386 --> 01:40:01.827]  Oh my gosh!
[01:40:01.827 --> 01:40:05.488]  Is this not going to be the best film you've ever made in your life?
[01:40:05.488 --> 01:40:10.409]  The CNN connected film crew that followed Jaden X to the Capitol was blown away!
[01:40:10.409 --> 01:40:14.390]  They couldn't believe that his boast of invading the Capitol and it succeeding came true.
[01:40:15.442 --> 01:40:24.250]  Jaden X had been boasting online and to hundreds of people in the streets that he indeed had helped online plan the attack on the Capitol.
[01:40:24.250 --> 01:40:26.532]  And when confronted with it, he didn't even deny it.
[01:40:26.532 --> 01:40:29.675]  He said that was another one of his personalities.
[01:40:29.675 --> 01:40:31.716]  You can disassociate yourself.
[01:40:31.716 --> 01:40:33.318]  I am John Sullivan.
[01:40:33.318 --> 01:40:34.299]  I have Jaden X.
[01:40:37.604 --> 01:40:45.930]  And it's not just Jaden X. Many other known leftist activists from around the country came to D.C.
[01:40:45.930 --> 01:40:49.792]  and posed as Trump supporters and helped rile up the crowd.
[01:40:49.792 --> 01:40:57.858]  While Trump was still speaking a mile and a half away at the Ellipse outside the White House, already over 100,000 people had showed up at the Capitol.
[01:40:58.522 --> 01:41:13.270]  And observant patriots noticed that in the grass, in the bushes, behind the trees, people wearing all black, people with anti-fascist style dress and gear were putting on MAGA gear, putting on Trump gear.
[01:41:13.270 --> 01:41:19.694]  And this again is just more evidence of how the left didn't overtly show up to confront Trump supporters that day.
[01:41:19.694 --> 01:41:22.495]  They simply blended in and added to the hysteria.
[01:41:29.739 --> 01:41:45.823]  In October of last year, investigative journalist Millie Weaver, who had been tracking the Sunrise Project for more than two years, that's basically a college-level George Soros Democratic Party-funded group that teaches Antifa and BLM tactics.
[01:41:45.823 --> 01:41:55.905]  Millie got dozens of hours from an inside whistleblower of this organization planning to carry out the exact type of insurrection that then took place on January 6th.
[01:41:57.034 --> 01:42:22.703]  Our undercover inside the Sunrise Movement was able to obtain exclusive video footage inside Zoom chats where Shutdown DC, BLM and other leftist organizations are coordinating a multi-level coup action exercise utilizing insider help from Democrat Party members as well as federal employees and intelligence contractors.
[01:42:23.363 --> 01:42:25.985]  I'm a management and programs analyst.
[01:42:25.985 --> 01:42:27.165]  All right, stay there.
[01:42:27.165 --> 01:42:33.149]  We're going to come back because we have the audio where they admit that we're going to go stage the Capitol attack and we're organizing online.
[01:42:33.149 --> 01:42:34.430]  We're going to blame the Republicans.
[01:42:36.524 --> 01:42:38.606]  I knew Trump was embattled.
[01:42:38.606 --> 01:42:42.568]  I knew he was surrounded by cowards and by double-talking agents.
[01:43:08.348 --> 01:43:12.112]  You're like, oh no, it's 3G chess, 5G chess, he's invincible.
[01:43:12.112 --> 01:43:15.576]  And I understand why people wanted to believe that, because this is scary what's going on.
[01:43:15.576 --> 01:43:21.202]  The global government, the New World Order, and now that people have woken up to the fact that it's real, they want somebody to come save them from it.
[01:43:21.202 --> 01:43:23.184]  Well, Trump sure as hell tried.
[01:43:23.184 --> 01:43:29.271]  My gosh, look at how prescription drug prices just tripled or quadrupled depending on the drug once Biden signed that executive order.
[01:43:30.069 --> 01:43:31.290]  We pay the most money in the world.
[01:43:31.290 --> 01:43:34.894]  That's just one case of hundreds of things that Trump has reversed.
[01:43:34.894 --> 01:43:39.238]  And now people are going to feel the sting and the pain, the energy cost, everything else.
[01:43:39.238 --> 01:43:51.830]  But what's really illustrated this is the trial in the Senate where Trump's own lawyers are attacking him and putting him down and saying he lost the election and just engaged in all sorts of criminal activity because the fix is in, folks.
[01:43:52.290 --> 01:43:53.831]  The swamp is deep.
[01:43:53.831 --> 01:43:56.033]  Trump fought it, but it's up to us to win it.
[01:43:56.033 --> 01:44:04.179]  Agenda 21 and Agenda 2030 are all about making you dependent and cutting you off from energy, food, and medicine.
[01:44:04.179 --> 01:44:12.846]  And with the blackouts we've seen that are guaranteed to be engineered to bring in federal and globalist control, we have seen massive lines of people
[01:44:13.892 --> 01:44:21.838]  Lined up at a few grocery stores and restaurants that were open and most of them getting turned away after hours of freezing in the cold.
[01:44:21.838 --> 01:44:27.662]  We've seen millions of people sleeping in their cars because they don't have any power in their house and then running out of gas.
[01:44:27.662 --> 01:44:29.604]  Ladies and gentlemen, energy is king.
[01:44:30.044 --> 01:44:33.445]  And food is the energy our bodies run off of, and water as well.
[01:44:33.445 --> 01:44:40.748]  They're both available, the highest quality water filtration and the highest quality storable foods right now, massively discounted, because of this emergency.

[01:44:57.149 --> 01:44:59.551]  The Resistance dot video.
[01:44:59.551 --> 01:45:01.952]  The Resistance dot video.
[01:45:01.952 --> 01:45:04.193]  The Resistance dot video.
[01:45:04.193 --> 01:45:06.354]  The Resistance dot video.
[01:45:06.354 --> 01:45:08.536]  The Resistance dot video.
[01:45:08.536 --> 01:45:11.397]  The Resistance dot video.
[01:45:11.397 --> 01:45:12.518]  InfoWars.com
[01:45:13.380 --> 01:45:20.385]  Newswars.com, Ban.video, and hundreds of other URLs we've launched have been banned.
[01:45:20.385 --> 01:45:26.069]  That's why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it.
[01:45:26.069 --> 01:45:29.532]  But Soros and Bill Gates and the Globalists are on our tail.
[01:45:30.312 --> 01:45:34.953]  But the new website is TheResistance.Video.
[01:45:34.953 --> 01:45:36.894]  TheResistance.Video.
[01:45:36.894 --> 01:45:41.335]  They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them.
[01:45:41.335 --> 01:45:51.937]  So the new URL that links right to Band.Video, and all of our videos, and all of our documentaries, and all the special reports, and all the suppressed information, is at TheResistance.Video.
[01:45:51.937 --> 01:45:52.857]  Share the link.
[01:45:52.857 --> 01:45:54.458]  TheResistance.Video.
[01:45:54.458 --> 01:45:55.598]  TheResistance.Video.
[01:45:56.855 --> 01:46:03.502]  In the early 1990s, there was a really funny movie that came out called Wayne's World.
[01:46:03.502 --> 01:46:11.349]  Even before I had an access TV show in the mid-1990s, I went and saw that movie and thought, man, that looks fun.
[01:46:11.349 --> 01:46:17.375]  In fact, you speak out, have your own ideas, and even if you're a nerd, you're still entertaining because you're real.
[01:46:17.375 --> 01:46:19.197]  Well, what do they say in Wayne's World?
[01:46:21.251 --> 01:46:23.133]  We're not worthy!
[01:46:23.133 --> 01:46:26.616]  Every day when I cover these huge topics, I don't feel worthy to talk to you.
[01:46:26.616 --> 01:46:29.098]  Because these topics are so huge, they're so real.
[01:46:29.098 --> 01:46:30.499]  But I'm trying to tell you the truth.
[01:46:30.499 --> 01:46:32.541]  I'm trying to get it right, and most of the time we do.
[01:46:32.541 --> 01:46:34.202]  The globalists love lying to you.
[01:46:34.202 --> 01:46:35.543]  They love manipulating you.
[01:46:35.543 --> 01:46:38.265]  They enjoy destroying humanity.
[01:46:38.265 --> 01:46:42.869]  They enjoy manipulating ideas and using people's ignorance against them.
[01:46:42.869 --> 01:46:45.231]  That, for me, is really satan.
[01:46:45.231 --> 01:46:45.812]  And disgusting.
[01:46:45.812 --> 01:46:48.594]  So you've got to pledge for myself and the whole InfoWars crew
[01:46:50.211 --> 01:46:52.114]  We will never join the Globals.
[01:46:52.114 --> 01:46:54.157]  We will never knowingly manipulate you.
[01:46:54.157 --> 01:46:58.925]  Because we know we're all in this together.
[01:46:58.925 --> 01:47:01.549]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:12.486 --> 01:47:14.387]  Alright, it's the final segment of my Sunday show.
[01:47:14.387 --> 01:47:15.468]  I'll be back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[01:47:15.468 --> 01:47:16.448]  Central, Lord willing.
[01:47:16.448 --> 01:47:22.291]  Owen Shroyer takes over for two hours with Sunday Live, and he's going to end the last five minutes of this report.
[01:47:22.291 --> 01:47:29.835]  We'll have time to air about eight, nine minutes of it now, then he'll air at the very start of his show the conclusion of this report.
[01:47:29.835 --> 01:47:32.997]  In about 20 minutes or so, it'll be posted to Band.Video.
[01:47:32.997 --> 01:47:36.018]  We just finished it 20 minutes ago or so.
[01:47:36.018 --> 01:47:37.319]  Democrats confess
[01:47:38.675 --> 01:47:41.376]  To staging the Capitol attack on January 6th.
[01:47:41.376 --> 01:47:42.417]  They're so criminal.
[01:47:42.417 --> 01:47:43.457]  They're bragging about it.
[01:47:43.457 --> 01:47:44.138]  It's smoking gun.
[01:47:44.138 --> 01:47:45.698]  It's all come out in the last week.
[01:47:45.698 --> 01:47:51.701]  And all the final pieces, with Millie Weaver's help, she's always been a great journalist, have come together.
[01:47:51.701 --> 01:48:03.907]  So let's go ahead and finish with as much as a report as we can get to, and then it'll be posted to Bandot Video, where if you share it on your email, your text message, your word of mouth, post it on your own site, it will shake the globalists to their very foundations.
[01:48:04.127 --> 01:48:08.312]  Because they're launching a new civil war and a martial law takeover on the back of this lie.
[01:48:08.312 --> 01:48:10.073]  Here it is.
[01:48:10.073 --> 01:48:12.896]  I'm a management and programs analyst.
[01:48:12.896 --> 01:48:15.820]  I work in the national security community.
[01:48:15.820 --> 01:48:22.547]  I spent three and a half years as a contractor at DHS HQ.
[01:48:22.547 --> 01:48:26.151]  If you read the mainstream press, they all have Signal accounts.
[01:48:27.128 --> 01:48:28.990]  Text them, leak everything you can.
[01:48:28.990 --> 01:48:35.997]  The journalists I've dealt with have been super ethical in ways to shield me to be the source of the leaks.
[01:48:35.997 --> 01:48:41.443]  Groups on the outside being able to show solidarity with federal workers.
[01:48:41.443 --> 01:48:43.045]  Making sure that we're naming.
[01:48:43.607 --> 01:48:45.587]  What is happening is a coup.
[01:48:45.587 --> 01:48:46.408]  Totally agreed.
[01:48:46.408 --> 01:48:47.488]  In the shutdown D.C.
[01:48:47.488 --> 01:48:53.949]  conversations that I've been having that's not on the federal side, we also are often saying that we'll call it a coup.
[01:48:53.949 --> 01:48:56.910]  They plan to shut down Washington D.C.
[01:48:56.910 --> 01:48:58.490]  and other major U.S.
[01:48:58.490 --> 01:49:03.171]  cities starting November 4th until Inauguration Day.
[01:49:03.171 --> 01:49:05.812]  Do we have any plans for how to respond if there's a coup?
[01:49:06.272 --> 01:49:10.034]  Come to BLM Plaza anytime after 4 p.m.
[01:49:10.034 --> 01:49:11.255]  on election night.
[01:49:11.255 --> 01:49:14.536]  On the 5th, we're going to shut down the White House.
[01:49:14.536 --> 01:49:19.239]  Map the White House and know every access point so we know we can blockade it.
[01:49:19.239 --> 01:49:24.021]  On the 6th, we're going to shut down larger parts of Washington, D.C.
[01:49:24.021 --> 01:49:27.323]  We've been working on a target map and a framework for scenario.
[01:49:27.323 --> 01:49:29.424]  So where are all the police stations?
[01:49:29.864 --> 01:49:31.944]  We're all the key government buildings.
[01:49:31.944 --> 01:49:33.865]  Who are the Trump boosters?
[01:49:33.865 --> 01:49:35.345]  Members of Congress, they're coming in.
[01:49:35.345 --> 01:49:36.585]  So this is the insurrection, as you can see.
[01:49:36.585 --> 01:49:38.746]  We're going to make it to the airports or at Union Station.
[01:49:38.746 --> 01:49:39.966]  Then they pose to our people.
[01:49:39.966 --> 01:49:44.527]  And send it back to where they came from until we deal with the situation that we're in.
[01:49:44.527 --> 01:49:49.128]  We are going to be in a crisis, but we want it to be one that we are creating.
[01:49:49.128 --> 01:49:51.689]  Whoever's got the guns can win.
[01:49:51.689 --> 01:49:53.169]  Let's take over the buildings.
[01:49:53.169 --> 01:49:56.130]  If there are people that are willing to do that, we should support them.
[01:49:56.130 --> 01:49:57.950]  Get ready to shut your city down on the 4th or the 5th.
[01:49:58.770 --> 01:50:03.134]  Regardless of who wins, the left plans to take over.
[01:50:03.134 --> 01:50:08.699]  And then, on the night of the 6th, Millie Weaver was able to actually confront Jake Nex.
[01:50:08.699 --> 01:50:13.563]  Hey, so, were you... Yeah.
[01:50:13.563 --> 01:50:15.684]  Are you BLM?
[01:50:15.684 --> 01:50:18.987]  Are you Black Lives Matter?
[01:50:18.987 --> 01:50:25.072]  John, can you just answer, are you Black Lives Matter with Black Lives Matter, or are you with the right wing people?
[01:50:25.072 --> 01:50:26.774]  Yeah, but, are you Black Lives Matter?
[01:50:27.449 --> 01:50:29.650]  Notice he uses the mask to cover himself.
[01:50:29.650 --> 01:50:35.811]  So he just said on the phone that he is not being charged with anything.
[01:50:35.811 --> 01:50:37.912]  Did you say you weren't being charged with anything?
[01:50:37.912 --> 01:50:40.733]  I thought I heard you say that.
[01:50:40.733 --> 01:50:44.714]  Are you Black Lives Matter, John?
[01:50:44.714 --> 01:50:49.595]  I'm of the opinion that what we saw yesterday was very much by design.
[01:50:50.620 --> 01:50:52.762]  That we did have agent provocateurs.
[01:50:52.762 --> 01:50:53.943]  Mmm.
[01:50:53.943 --> 01:50:56.106]  And I'm of the opinion that you're one of them.
[01:50:56.106 --> 01:50:56.966]  Interesting.
[01:50:56.966 --> 01:50:57.987]  Really interesting on that.
[01:50:57.987 --> 01:50:59.729]  Why do you think I'm one of them?
[01:50:59.729 --> 01:51:01.191]  Because you're who your father is.
[01:51:01.191 --> 01:51:02.652]  Your father's psyops, man.
[01:51:02.652 --> 01:51:05.054]  So, you've met my dad, okay?
[01:51:05.054 --> 01:51:09.139]  So... Kind of... further elaborates my point.
[01:51:09.139 --> 01:51:12.522]  Let me just explain it to you, because... I know he'd work in the storm to copy me.
[01:51:13.869 --> 01:51:14.649]  I'm on chats.
[01:51:14.649 --> 01:51:15.750]  I'm on underground chats.
[01:51:15.750 --> 01:51:17.591]  Like, I have my resources.
[01:51:17.591 --> 01:51:18.692]  I have my resources.
[01:51:18.692 --> 01:51:21.654]  There's not me, but I have people, right?
[01:51:21.654 --> 01:51:25.077]  And I'm not saying some fucking cop type shit.
[01:51:25.077 --> 01:51:34.524]  I'm saying my people in my organization, Insurgents USA, is a civil rights group that is Black Lives Matter.
[01:51:34.524 --> 01:51:41.889]  Or if you want to label it in Tifa, because Trump wants to label it in Tifa, but I label myself as Insurgents USA, but for people's context, right?
[01:51:43.772 --> 01:51:46.113]  Yeah, they are in chats.
[01:51:46.113 --> 01:51:49.753]  They can easily give me information on what's going on and same with everybody else.
[01:51:49.753 --> 01:51:51.594]  But it's a collective of people.
[01:51:51.594 --> 01:51:53.694]  You can disassociate yourself.
[01:51:53.694 --> 01:51:55.255]  I have John Sullivan.
[01:51:55.255 --> 01:51:58.115]  I have Jaden X. That separates.
[01:51:58.115 --> 01:52:00.736]  I have Insurgency USA, a civil rights organization.
[01:52:00.736 --> 01:52:06.337]  So it separates my identity based on the specific role that I'm playing, right?
[01:52:06.337 --> 01:52:07.837]  Is there really a separation?
[01:52:07.837 --> 01:52:08.777]  There is a separation.
[01:52:08.777 --> 01:52:10.318]  There is a separation for sure because
[01:52:12.729 --> 01:52:22.816]  I can't be in a crowd full of Trump supporters and say f**k the police or say the things that I would during my regular activism.
[01:52:22.816 --> 01:52:33.783]  Now we've looked at some of the smoking gun, caught red-handed, bombshell evidence of the Democratic Party, Soros, and the Deep State manipulating the crowd.
[01:52:33.783 --> 01:52:38.626]  We're going to look at one more piece and then we're going to get to the really sad information.
[01:52:38.626 --> 01:52:39.507]  The fact that some of the
[01:52:40.706 --> 01:52:46.488]  Best organizations in the past in this country, when it came to promoting freedom, were infiltrated.
[01:52:46.488 --> 01:52:51.329]  And it's important to go over this to understand the truth of what happened, so it won't happen again.
[01:52:51.329 --> 01:53:04.492]  Observing Antifa over the last decade or so, we know they're funded by the UN, by George Soros, by the Democrats in Deep State, to undermine America, attack free speech, and call anybody that doesn't support that a racist and a Nazi.
[01:53:04.492 --> 01:53:06.493]  They are the equivalent of the left's brown shirts.
[01:53:11.288 --> 01:53:11.428]  I think?
[01:53:23.397 --> 01:53:42.752]  And in the documents that are on screen, they talked about how Obama wanted to trigger martial law nationwide back in 2015, and even put troops in Maryland, by using Antifa to go out and try to provoke the black community into rioting and burning down police stations and government buildings.
[01:53:42.752 --> 01:53:43.353]  They failed.
[01:53:43.985 --> 01:53:50.051]  And so the chain reaction did not take place and Obama didn't get to stay in office using martial law.
[01:53:50.051 --> 01:53:54.456]  But that's what Antifa are specialists at and experts.
[01:53:54.456 --> 01:53:59.581]  They even have maps when they go into an area of where they're allowed to attack, what they're going to do.
[01:53:59.581 --> 01:54:07.069]  And it's always done in blue cities and blue states where they're actually working with the mayors and chiefs of police
[01:54:07.975 --> 01:54:14.638]  to go out and carry out this low-intensity terror knowing that they have a get-out-of-jail-free card and are not going to get in trouble.
[01:54:14.638 --> 01:54:23.441]  And if they do get arrested, the charges are almost always dropped and their bail is paid for by the Democratic Party, George Soros, and of course Hollywood.
[01:54:24.404 --> 01:54:29.206]  And I want to make clear that I know that there are protests still happening in major cities across the United States.
[01:54:29.206 --> 01:54:33.907]  I'm just not seeing the reporting on it that I had for the first few weeks.
[01:54:33.907 --> 01:54:34.887]  They're not going to stop.
[01:54:34.887 --> 01:54:36.468]  They're not going to stop.
[01:54:36.468 --> 01:54:39.129]  This is a movement, I'm telling you.
[01:54:39.129 --> 01:54:40.309]  They're not going to stop.
[01:54:40.749 --> 01:54:44.592]  And everyone beware, because they're not going to stop.
[01:54:44.592 --> 01:54:49.476]  They're not going to stop before Election Day in November, and they're not going to stop after Election Day.
[01:54:49.476 --> 01:54:53.860]  And everyone should take note of that on both levels.
[01:54:53.860 --> 01:54:56.021]  They're not going to let up, and they should not.
[01:54:56.021 --> 01:54:57.863]  And we should not.
[01:54:57.863 --> 01:54:59.564]  So think about that.
[01:54:59.564 --> 01:55:01.526]  A couple hundred people go into Capitol.
[01:55:01.526 --> 01:55:05.669]  Maybe 20 of them are somewhat violent, defecate on the floor, beat up some police.
[01:55:05.669 --> 01:55:06.530]  Nobody's defending that.
[01:55:07.136 --> 01:55:11.819]  But they're calling this a Pearl Harbor event, when you had a whole swath of the U.S.
[01:55:11.819 --> 01:55:21.446]  burned down, and you had the now-Vice President helping bail people out that, again, attacked police and burned down police stations.
[01:55:21.446 --> 01:55:23.308]  And we've only scratched the surface here.
[01:55:23.308 --> 01:55:33.295]  You've got a former high-level FBI top security clearance commander of FBI operations, that's confirmed, leading the assault.
[01:55:33.295 --> 01:55:33.955]  You've got the
[01:55:36.178 --> 01:55:45.568]  Son-in-law of Nancy Pelosi inside, and then you've got the cue boards again saying, oh don't worry, Trump's coming back.
[01:55:45.568 --> 01:55:51.975]  The real inauguration is March 4th, so they can hopefully manipulate some more people into doing something violent.
[01:55:55.593 --> 01:56:07.256]  And as I'm now experiencing, as the entire mainstream corporate media tries to frame myself and Roger Stone and others for what they themselves actually orchestrated on January 6th.
[01:56:07.256 --> 01:56:12.257]  Now, as Paul Harvey would say, here is the rest of the story.
[01:56:12.257 --> 01:56:13.598]  I like Oath Keepers.
[01:56:13.598 --> 01:56:14.518]  I know Stuart Rhodes.
[01:56:14.518 --> 01:56:16.339]  They have a constitutional mission.
[01:56:16.339 --> 01:56:19.339]  He's a great guy and doesn't want offensive violence.
[01:56:19.339 --> 01:56:20.420]  He wants to defend the Republic.
[01:56:20.420 --> 01:56:21.660]  And most Oath Keepers are great.
[01:56:22.600 --> 01:56:48.510]  But through the Q movement and through these message boards that Jaden X was talking about, they were able to pose as right-wingers through some of the cut-out militia groups like the Buggaloos and others, and were able to go into Oath Keepers, go into Proud Boys, and go into some of the Q groups and actually organize people who believe they were coming to the Capitol waiting for Trump to actually show up and lead them in a takeover.
[01:56:50.439 --> 01:56:52.102]  It's the last five-minute conclusion.
[01:56:52.102 --> 01:56:53.264]  It's the key to all of it.
[01:56:53.264 --> 01:56:55.307]  The full video will be posted.
[01:56:55.307 --> 01:56:56.509]  It's being uploaded right now.
[01:56:56.509 --> 01:56:57.431]  It's HD.
[01:56:57.431 --> 01:56:58.352]  It takes a while.
[01:56:58.352 --> 01:56:59.774]  To Band.Video.
[01:56:59.774 --> 01:57:02.459]  And it's just so critical to get this out.
[01:57:03.334 --> 01:57:08.095]  And I'll probably do another video just on how they're trying to set the police up and claim they were involved.
[01:57:08.095 --> 01:57:11.096]  No, no, it's the police on top that were involved that ordered the stand down.
[01:57:11.096 --> 01:57:16.737]  Now they want to scare the Capitol Police and, I guess, kill a few others or make them commit suicide so this doesn't come out.
[01:57:16.737 --> 01:57:25.478]  But we are going to expose the Capitol Police did a great job and they were under a PSYOP, physical globalist attack, and were very sad for the officer that had a heart attack and died.
[01:57:25.478 --> 01:57:26.919]  And we were not with the leftists.
[01:57:26.919 --> 01:57:28.639]  Alright, Owen Schroer is coming up.
[01:57:28.639 --> 01:57:29.859]  We'll finish the report at the start.
[01:57:29.859 --> 01:57:30.840]  He takes over.
